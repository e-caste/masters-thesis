00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.852
Prof: All right,
well, today I'm going to talk

00:00:04.852 --> 00:00:06.250
about Social Security again.
 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.345
There's going to be one more
discussion of Social Security

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:09.780
later.
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.930
I'm going to defer most of my
plan until later,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.560
but I want to finish the
discussion so that we totally

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.410
understand the subject.
 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.135
It'll also allow me talk about
demography and introduce one of

00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:25.617
the most famous models in
economics called the Overlapping

00:00:25.617 --> 00:00:26.900
Generation Model.
 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:32.466
So in the 1940s someone named
Maurice Allais,

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:38.159
a French economist,
introduced the Overlapping

00:00:38.159 --> 00:00:42.840
Generations Model into
economics.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.900
He wrote it in French and it
was sort of rediscovered by

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.110
Samuelson in the 1950s.
 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.610
I'm not sure whether Samuelson
had read Allais.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.514
I think Samuelson may well have
read Allais, but anyway

00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:03.128
Samuelson--so these were 1947,
something like that,

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:06.310
1958 in which Samuelson
rediscovered it.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.721
And you'll see it's a very
basic thought and it seemed at

00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:15.290
first to challenge everything
that we've learned so far.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.882
So the idea of the Overlapping
Generations Model is that time

00:01:18.882 --> 00:01:22.533
doesn't have a beginning and an
end like we've assumed so far,

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.269
time might go on forever.
 

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:27.519
Now, whether or not you believe
time--

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:30.051
whether there's scientific
proof that time goes on forever

00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:32.849
or scientific proof that the
universe has to come to an end,

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.176
let's face it,
many of our institutions

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:37.379
presume that time goes on
forever.

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:42.497
The chief most important among
them is Social Security which

00:01:42.497 --> 00:01:47.268
we'll see is the easiest thing
to, the model's design to

00:01:47.268 --> 00:01:48.569
understand.
 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:54.925
The idea of Social Security is
the pay as you go Social

00:01:54.925 --> 00:01:56.220
Security.
 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.534
The idea of Frances Perkins was
that every young generation was

00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:04.058
going to give money to the old,
but they shouldn't worry so

00:02:04.058 --> 00:02:06.334
much about it because when they
got old the next young

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:07.879
generation would give them
money.

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.956
Obviously if you thought time
was going to come to an end the

00:02:10.956 --> 00:02:13.705
last young generation,
knowing that they were the last

00:02:13.705 --> 00:02:15.692
generation,
would refuse to give money to

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:18.485
the old because they weren't
going to get anything back when

00:02:18.485 --> 00:02:19.288
they were old.
 

00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:21.789
But then the second to last
generation knowing that when

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:24.016
they got old that they'd get
nothing from the last

00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:27.199
generation's young they wouldn't
give anything either to the old,

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.086
and working backwards like that
if everybody's rational and it's

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:32.792
common knowledge that the world
is going to end nobody would

00:02:32.792 --> 00:02:35.128
ever participate in the Social
Security scheme.

00:02:35.128 --> 00:02:38.669
So it's clear that there's some
thought that the world might

00:02:38.669 --> 00:02:41.848
end, or at least there's a
thought that it's not worth

00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:44.068
bothering about the world
ending.

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:49.434
So the Overlapping Generations
Model is meant to take that idea

00:02:49.434 --> 00:02:54.280
extremely seriously and imagine
life going on forever.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.277
So let's take the simplest
example where there's a

00:02:58.277 --> 00:03:01.867
generation that
begins--generations last when

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:03.990
they're young and old.
 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.610
So let's say we're at time 1
here, and there's a generation

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.780
that's young and a generation
that's old.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.719
Maybe I'll write it a little
bit lower.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:20.110
Sorry about that.
 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.092
So there's an old generation
and a young generation and the

00:03:24.092 --> 00:03:26.770
endowment of the old generation
is 1.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.014
The young generation has 3 when
it's young, 1 when it's old,

00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:31.883
3 when it's young,
1 when it's old,

00:03:31.883 --> 00:03:34.030
3 when it's young,
1 when it's old.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.818
So when you're young you have 3
apples.

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.460
When you're old you have 1
apple.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.840
The next generation when it's
young has 3 apples.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.520
When it's old it has 1 apple
and so on forever.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.842
So this'll be T = 1 here,
2 here, 3 here,

00:03:52.842 --> 00:03:56.319
4 here, etcetera.
 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.430
So it goes on forever like that.
 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.788
Now, what did Allais and
Samuelson both basically say?

00:04:02.788 --> 00:04:05.451
They both basically said,
look, everybody when they're

00:04:05.451 --> 00:04:07.009
young is incredibly well off.
 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.569
They're working.
 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:08.560
They're productive.
 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.578
When they're old and retired
and feeble they don't have very

00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:15.960
much, but what can you do?
 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.540
Where can you trade?
 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.120
According to Samuelson what
does the old have to trade?

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:28.149
It doesn't look like there's
any trade that can take place.

00:04:28.149 --> 00:04:33.584
So it seems like it would be
very helpful if the young would

00:04:33.584 --> 00:04:37.495
give the old something,
and when they got old the next

00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:39.769
generations young could give
them something.

00:04:39.769 --> 00:04:43.310
So the young could constantly
be making gifts to the old.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.000
That was Allais and Samuelson's
idea and it's very closely

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.879
related to Social Security.
 

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.961
So Samuelson got a little
carried away with his idea and

00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:57.267
he said that Social Security was
the greatest and only true

00:04:57.267 --> 00:05:01.350
beneficial Ponzi scheme ever
invented because in a Ponzi

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.803
scheme,
this has gotten a lot of

00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:12.350
attention lately thanks to our
famous Madoff.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.420
So a Ponzi scheme is basically
an investment strategy where you

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.610
take the money that people give
you,

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.317
and you buy yachts with it,
and then when they ask for

00:05:24.317 --> 00:05:28.653
their money back you tell them
that you've gotten great returns

00:05:28.653 --> 00:05:33.129
and you just hand them money
that new people have given you.

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:34.879
So they think you've gotten
great returns.

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.824
And when that second generation
of people wants their money back

00:05:37.824 --> 00:05:39.485
you tell them,
well, you've invested it

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:41.112
brilliantly,
you've gotten great returns,

00:05:41.112 --> 00:05:43.476
but all you're doing is giving
them the money that the third

00:05:43.476 --> 00:05:45.997
generation is giving you,
and you keep going like that

00:05:45.997 --> 00:05:48.910
until finally you owe so much
money you can't find new people

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.870
fast enough to pay the people
off and then everybody discovers

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.910
the Ponzi scheme and it all
unravels.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.644
And the people at the beginning
have made out very well and the

00:05:57.644 --> 00:06:00.826
people at end who,
you know, the second to last

00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:04.661
generation they've lost all
their money and then lawsuits

00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:05.620
accumulate.
 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.084
And it's quite interesting that
in the Ponzi scheme the very

00:06:10.084 --> 00:06:14.778
first generations that benefited
are not free because the whole

00:06:14.778 --> 00:06:16.519
thing was a scheme.
 

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:18.898
The guy Madoff running it knew
from the beginning what was

00:06:18.898 --> 00:06:19.649
going to happen.
 

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:22.242
And so those first generation
of people, there's no reason why

00:06:22.242 --> 00:06:24.069
they deserve to make their great
returns.

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:25.709
They benefited from the Ponzi
scheme,

00:06:25.709 --> 00:06:29.420
so the last generations suing
Madoff are effectively suing the

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.223
first people as well,
and so we'll see how the courts

00:06:32.223 --> 00:06:32.699
decide it.
 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.759
But often the people who get
out of the Ponzi scheme early

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.391
still are held liable and the
money is taken back,

00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:40.699
so we'll see what happens in
this case.

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:43.992
But anyway, so obviously Ponzi
schemes are terrible ideas in

00:06:43.992 --> 00:06:44.550
general.
 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.446
But Samuelson said well,
when life is going on forever

00:06:47.446 --> 00:06:50.180
there might not have to be an
end to the scheme.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.389
It just keeps going.
 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:52.529
This guy gives to this guy.
 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:53.620
This guy gives to this guy.
 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.134
There's no reason for the Ponzi
scheme to end if you really

00:06:56.134 --> 00:06:58.259
think that the world's going to
go on forever,

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.963
and therefore Social Security
is a great Ponzi scheme which is

00:07:01.963 --> 00:07:03.300
actually beneficial.
 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.649
So Samuelson even wrote this as
a journalist for

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:09.360
Newsweek and there's
many--

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:12.057
I happened to be a little boy
when he was writing this stuff

00:07:12.057 --> 00:07:14.708
and I remember some of the
articles and I've gone and found

00:07:14.708 --> 00:07:15.120
them.
 

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:19.259
And so he describes the
benefits of Social Security as a

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:20.389
Ponzi scheme.
 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:27.771
So this didn't turn out to be
quite right, but it certainly

00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:30.189
sounds plausible.
 

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:33.565
Another thing he said was he
said that in the Social

00:07:33.565 --> 00:07:36.065
Security--
money, you could think of as a

00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:39.029
Ponzi scheme,
money too, because you have

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:43.699
worthless pieces of paper,
but you're willing to hold them

00:07:43.699 --> 00:07:46.641
when you're young,
you'll accept them for goods

00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:49.663
because when you get old you can
find the next guy who's willing

00:07:49.663 --> 00:07:52.665
to give up goods for your money,
and that guy is willing to take

00:07:52.665 --> 00:07:55.173
the money for it because when he
gets old he can find the next

00:07:55.173 --> 00:07:57.889
generation's young who's willing
to give up good for his money.

00:07:57.889 --> 00:07:59.973
So the money,
which is a worthless piece of

00:07:59.973 --> 00:08:02.069
paper,
never gets exposed as being

00:08:02.069 --> 00:08:05.738
worthless because there's always
another generation around to

00:08:05.738 --> 00:08:09.588
take it who thinks they're going
to be able to use it later.

00:08:09.588 --> 00:08:14.672
So these are fascinating topics
that Samuelson discussed,

00:08:14.672 --> 00:08:19.120
but I don't want to discuss
them in this class.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.889
I want to discuss Social
Security,

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:23.596
and so I'm going to do a
variant of the model that

00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:26.899
Samuelson never thought about,
which I think is a much more

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:27.800
realistic model.
 

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:32.740
So I'm going to do overlapping
generations with land,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:38.154
and you'll see that in this
model I'm going to add land to

00:08:38.154 --> 00:08:38.820
it.
 

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:41.529
It's, I think,
a more interesting model and

00:08:41.529 --> 00:08:45.206
I'm not going to discuss the
paradoxes of infinity because

00:08:45.206 --> 00:08:48.347
once you put land,
even though time goes on

00:08:48.347 --> 00:08:50.629
forever the paradoxes disappear.
 

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:53.658
So rather than spending all the
time on the paradoxes,

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.048
and how they come about,
and do they make sense,

00:08:56.048 --> 00:08:58.956
I'm just going to add land from
the beginning and it will

00:08:58.956 --> 00:09:01.760
recapitulate in a nice way
almost everything we've done

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.409
this semester and there won't be
any paradoxes.

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:06.600
So what do I mean by land?
 

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:14.076
I mean suppose that land
produces 1, so this is land

00:09:14.076 --> 00:09:19.058
output, produces 1 every period.
 

00:09:19.058 --> 00:09:22.282
So there's another output
called apples that just,

00:09:22.282 --> 00:09:25.241
you know, a tree that's going
to live forever,

00:09:25.241 --> 00:09:28.860
let's call it land,
produces 1 every single period.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:35.706
So here are the periods and
this is what's happening in

00:09:35.706 --> 00:09:37.610
every period.
 

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.643
Now, land seems to make the
situation much more complicated,

00:09:41.643 --> 00:09:45.677
but in fact it will turn out
that we can analyze this pretty

00:09:45.677 --> 00:09:46.428
easily.
 

00:09:46.428 --> 00:09:52.048
So let me summarize,
again, the model.

00:09:52.048 --> 00:09:55.702
The model is that every
generation has 1 agent or a

00:09:55.702 --> 00:09:58.480
million identical agents,
let's say.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:07.667
Every generation has
endowments, so every generation

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:10.908
t has endowment.
 

00:10:10.908 --> 00:10:17.352
It's generation t so it's an
endowment at time t and at time

00:10:17.352 --> 00:10:21.985
t 1 equals (3,
1) and let's say they all have

00:10:21.985 --> 00:10:26.428
utility and the utility of every
generation t,

00:10:26.428 --> 00:10:35.842
which only depends on what they
consume when they're young and

00:10:35.842 --> 00:10:42.788
old let's say is log
x_t log x_t

00:10:42.788 --> 00:10:44.639
1.
 

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:47.418
So everybody cares about
consumption when they're young,

00:10:47.418 --> 00:10:49.943
consumption when they're old,
they don't care about

00:10:49.943 --> 00:10:51.509
consumption any other time.
 

00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:53.288
They begin with 3 apples when
they're young.

00:10:53.288 --> 00:10:55.580
They know they're going to have
1 apple when they're old.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:11:00.498
Everybody's like that for
generation t greater than or

00:11:00.498 --> 00:11:04.488
equal to 1, but generation 0
just has U^(0),

00:11:04.488 --> 00:11:07.178
so I can call that U^(t).
 

00:11:07.178 --> 00:11:15.198
Generation 0 only cares about
consumption when old and that's

00:11:15.198 --> 00:11:18.139
that guy at the top.
 

00:11:18.139 --> 00:11:21.450
But I also have to talk about
the land.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:29.028
Generation 0 owns the land.
 

00:11:29.028 --> 00:11:35.769
So that's the economy,
very simple economy,

00:11:35.769 --> 00:11:38.886
but it looks much more
complicated than anything we've

00:11:38.886 --> 00:11:40.956
done before,
but it will turn out not to be,

00:11:40.956 --> 00:11:42.220
but it looks it at first
glance.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.399
So every generation has 3
apples when young,

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:49.857
1 apple when old except the
very first generation which has

00:11:49.857 --> 00:11:53.240
land in addition to his 1 apple
when old,

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.658
and that land produces 1 apple
forever.

00:11:58.658 --> 00:12:01.679
So we have to figure out what
equilibrium is and then we have

00:12:01.679 --> 00:12:03.139
to look at Social Security.
 

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.822
And by doing this we're going
to understand Social Security

00:12:06.822 --> 00:12:08.918
much better than we did before.
 

00:12:08.918 --> 00:12:13.120
So are there any questions
about this, what's going on?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.980
Then I'm going to try and write
down what equilibrium is and

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.018
then solve it,
and then we're going to talk

00:12:18.018 --> 00:12:19.279
about Social Security.
 

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.009
Yep?
 

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:23.048
Student: Is U not
supposed to be

00:12:23.048 --> 00:12:25.288
&gt;?
 

00:12:25.288 --> 00:12:28.418
Prof: Oh,
well if you only can eat 1 good

00:12:28.418 --> 00:12:32.480
if I put log x_1 here
it would be the same thing.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.259
Remember if I take a monotonic
transformation,

00:12:36.259 --> 00:12:38.629
if I double the utility or take
the utility,

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:41.708
e to the utility like that,
which is just equal to

00:12:41.708 --> 00:12:44.600
x_1 it describes the
same utility.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.240
The guy's not trading anything
off.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.207
There's only 1 good,
so more of the good is better

00:12:48.207 --> 00:12:48.610
for him.
 

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.246
It doesn't matter if we call it
log x or x_1 is the

00:12:51.246 --> 00:12:53.048
same thing, but that's a good
question.

00:12:53.048 --> 00:12:57.181
Let's call it log
x_1,

00:12:57.181 --> 00:12:59.980
make him symmetric.
 

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.443
All right, well,
how would we define

00:13:02.443 --> 00:13:03.428
equilibrium?
 

00:13:03.428 --> 00:13:05.812
So there's financial
equilibrium, and then we're

00:13:05.812 --> 00:13:07.639
going to see if we can solve
this.

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:13.028
So what's happening in
financial equilibrium?

00:13:13.028 --> 00:13:15.399
Well, it's kind of interesting
here.

00:13:15.399 --> 00:13:19.746
There's going to have to be a
price of goods every period

00:13:19.746 --> 00:13:20.990
q_t.
 

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.710
That's the contemporaneous
price of apples.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:27.014
There's going to be the price
of land every period,

00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:29.330
pi, let's call it
pi_t.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:34.038
So this is apple price.
 

00:13:34.038 --> 00:13:45.610
So these are contemporaneous
prices.

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:52.551
With contemporaneous apple
price, land price,

00:13:52.551 --> 00:13:56.178
what else do we need?
 

00:13:56.178 --> 00:14:00.927
Well, we have to decide what
everybody's going to consume

00:14:00.927 --> 00:14:04.403
every period,
so generation t what they're

00:14:04.403 --> 00:14:08.220
going to consume when young and
when old.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.695
Then there's generation 0,
what they're going to consume

00:14:11.695 --> 00:14:12.389
when old.
 

00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:22.529
What else do I need to describe
equilibrium?

00:14:22.529 --> 00:14:25.210
That's probably it.
 

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:31.820
And so what's the budget set
everybody's going to face?

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:37.386
A budget set for t greater than
or equal to 1 is the set of

00:14:37.386 --> 00:14:43.048
all--let's call it young
consumption and old consumption.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:46.748
So generation t because it's
going to consume something when

00:14:46.748 --> 00:14:49.129
young and when old,
such that, what?

00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:50.600
What's the budget constraint?
 

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.604
Well, when they're young if
they want to consume goods they

00:14:55.604 --> 00:14:59.659
have to spend q_t to
consume goods.

00:14:59.659 --> 00:15:03.610
So this is young, call that Y.
 

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:07.038
And when they're old they're
going to have to consume,

00:15:07.038 --> 00:15:10.466
sorry, when they're young
they're consuming--what else

00:15:10.466 --> 00:15:12.149
would they want to do?
 

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:16.754
They might want to hold land so
we could call that

00:15:16.754 --> 00:15:22.488
pi_t and I better add
a theta here for their holding

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:25.283
of land,
pi_t theta,

00:15:25.283 --> 00:15:27.679
that's how much land they hold.
 

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:28.750
Remember how we did this?
 

00:15:28.750 --> 00:15:31.759
And then what have they got?
 

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:36.360
We'll they've got their
endowment, time t.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.500
This is time t, let's say.
 

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.678
This is generation t.
 

00:15:39.678 --> 00:15:44.644
So their endowment is going to
be e^(t)_t,

00:15:44.644 --> 00:15:48.245
but that's 3,
so I might as well write

00:15:48.245 --> 00:15:51.360
e^(t)_t just as 3.
 

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.830
And what else have they got?
 

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.100
Nothing?
 

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.426
Everybody comes into the world
with just apples when young and

00:16:04.426 --> 00:16:06.879
apples when old,
so when they're young they've

00:16:06.879 --> 00:16:08.570
got 3 apples they can sell.
 

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:11.720
They can consume something,
so 3 - q.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.806
The stuff they don't consume
they sell and they can buy land

00:16:14.806 --> 00:16:15.330
with it.
 

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:22.759
Ah, god all this time this
never happened.

00:16:22.759 --> 00:16:32.399
Sorry about that.
 

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:34.288
And when they're old what can
they do?

00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:37.666
Well, when they're old at
q_t 1,

00:16:37.666 --> 00:16:40.876
times Z now,
are they going to bother to

00:16:40.876 --> 00:16:43.759
hold the land when they're old?
 

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:46.551
No, because they're going to be
dead and they don't care about

00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:47.330
their children.
 

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.240
All they care about is eating
as much as they can.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.859
So they're going to sell all
their land, so that's got to be

00:16:52.859 --> 00:16:54.700
less than or equal to,
what?

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:58.155
And so here's the--what are
they going to get when they're

00:16:58.155 --> 00:16:58.519
old?
 

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:03.544
Well, they have q_t 1
when they're old,

00:17:03.544 --> 00:17:07.000
and their endowment,
of 1 what?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:14.170
They can sell their land
pi_t 1 times theta.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:16.609
Whatever they bought the first
time they can now sell when

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:17.210
they're old.
 

00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:28.108
Plus what else do they have?
 

00:17:28.108 --> 00:17:30.200
So one last term,
what else is it?

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.259
So see what they do.
 

00:17:31.259 --> 00:17:33.068
Why would you buy land?
 

00:17:33.068 --> 00:17:35.767
Well, because when you're young
you're so rich you don't want to

00:17:35.767 --> 00:17:37.480
consume everything when you're
young,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.430
so instead of consuming your
whole 3,

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:40.410
you consume less.
 

00:17:40.410 --> 00:17:42.613
You buy the land because the
land's going to be worth

00:17:42.613 --> 00:17:43.630
something next period.
 

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.450
So what is it going to give for
you next period?

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.410
What do you get next period
from the land?

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.640
Well, if you own the land you
get what?

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.220
You get the dividend.
 

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.377
So the dividend we have to
multiply by the price,

00:17:59.377 --> 00:18:02.338
which on one of the early
classes I forgot.

00:18:02.338 --> 00:18:04.806
And the dividend is 1,
that's the dividend,

00:18:04.806 --> 00:18:06.920
but how many dividends do you
get?

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.578
How many apples?
 

00:18:07.578 --> 00:18:09.930
It depends on how much of the
land you had.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.864
So if you had theta units of
the land you get,

00:18:12.864 --> 00:18:16.905
you know, if you had 3 acres of
land you get 3 apples which you

00:18:16.905 --> 00:18:19.578
can sell for a price q_t
1.

00:18:19.578 --> 00:18:23.394
You also still have the 3 acres
of land which you can sell off

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:24.519
when you're old.
 

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:27.910
So that's the revenue you get
by selling off the land and you

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.170
also sell off some of your
endowment,

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.538
maybe, and that's how you can
buy when you're old.

00:18:32.538 --> 00:18:36.051
So that's what the budget set
is of the young,

00:18:36.051 --> 00:18:37.769
of every generation.
 

00:18:37.769 --> 00:18:44.676
And the budget set for
generation t=0 is simply

00:18:44.676 --> 00:18:48.580
x_1,
is simply Z,

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:56.390
we'll call it Z such that what
does this guy do?

00:18:56.390 --> 00:19:00.426
Well, q_1Z has to be
less than or equal to,

00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:01.980
what does he have?
 

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:07.049
q_1 times 1,
plus he's got all the land.

00:19:07.049 --> 00:19:10.598
So he's got 1 acre of land.
 

00:19:10.598 --> 00:19:16.210
That's all the land there was,
so he's got pi

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.269
times--pi_1.
 

00:19:19.269 --> 00:19:22.453
He's got all the land,
so I've normalized the land to

00:19:22.453 --> 00:19:23.190
be 1 acre.
 

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:29.579
So pi 1 times all land.
 

00:19:29.579 --> 00:19:34.670
That's what that guy can do.
 

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:44.143
So equilibrium is,
x_t is best for

00:19:44.143 --> 00:19:55.160
generation t in budget set t and
x_1,

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:02.380
so this is this and theta,
and x_1--

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.130
did I write theta?
 

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.238
Oh, I forgot to write theta in
the definition of equilibrium

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:09.006
here,
so I have to write a theta t

00:20:09.006 --> 00:20:14.117
there also having to keep track
of how much land they're going

00:20:14.117 --> 00:20:15.039
to have.
 

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:18.910
This is t = 1 to infinity.
 

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:22.041
So the equilibrium is what are
the prices every period of

00:20:22.041 --> 00:20:23.048
apples and land?
 

00:20:23.048 --> 00:20:27.327
What does every generation do
in terms of their consumption

00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:31.752
and how much land they hold and
how much does that very first

00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:33.450
generation consume.
 

00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:36.071
It's obvious they're going to
sell all their land to consume

00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:37.048
as much as they can.
 

00:20:37.048 --> 00:20:42.608
So the budget set,
so x_1 solves.

00:20:42.608 --> 00:20:50.220
So Z = x_1 and y Z
theta equals that,

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.798
best for generation t in this
budget set,

00:20:52.798 --> 00:21:03.554
and Z = x_1 is best
for generation 0 in this budget

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:04.630
set.
 

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.838
So to say it in words it's very
simple in words,

00:21:07.838 --> 00:21:09.933
and then we have this
mathematics and it looks

00:21:09.933 --> 00:21:12.727
complicated but we're just going
to say it's going to be very

00:21:12.727 --> 00:21:15.519
short to solve it even though it
looks very complicated.

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:17.970
So the problem is this.
 

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:21.057
We've got generations who are
rich when young,

00:21:21.057 --> 00:21:23.596
poor when old,
there's land that lasts

00:21:23.596 --> 00:21:24.420
forever.
 

00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.579
The only way people can save is
by holding the land.

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:28.710
That's like holding stock.
 

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:30.150
That's holding something real.
 

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.023
So when they're young they're
going to take some of their

00:21:33.023 --> 00:21:35.104
extra endowment,
because they're so rich when

00:21:35.104 --> 00:21:36.513
young,
they've got 3 when young,

00:21:36.513 --> 00:21:38.308
and they're going to use it to
buy land.

00:21:38.308 --> 00:21:42.279
And when they get old they're
going to sell the land,

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:44.368
and eat the endowment from the
land,

00:21:44.368 --> 00:21:47.622
the dividend from the land,
and sell the land and use that

00:21:47.622 --> 00:21:50.990
sale proceed to also increase
their consumption when old.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.540
So they'll be taken care of
when they're old because they're

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.578
able to hold the land.
 

00:21:54.578 --> 00:21:57.170
And the question is how do we
solve for this equilibrium?

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:00.770
And so why is it--so just to go
back to Samuelson and all that,

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.338
why is it so interesting?
 

00:22:02.338 --> 00:22:06.065
Well, one of the reasons it's
interesting is that people when

00:22:06.065 --> 00:22:09.480
they're young have to think
about the price of land next

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:13.144
period when they're old because
they know they're buying the

00:22:13.144 --> 00:22:14.200
land today.
 

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.363
They can see the price today,
but when they get old they have

00:22:17.363 --> 00:22:18.505
to,
you know, why are they buying

00:22:18.505 --> 00:22:20.321
the land today,
partly for the dividend next

00:22:20.321 --> 00:22:23.141
period when they're old,
but also for the resale value

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:23.848
of the land.
 

00:22:23.848 --> 00:22:26.555
So everybody is thinking to
himself, what's the value of

00:22:26.555 --> 00:22:28.078
land going to be next period?
 

00:22:28.078 --> 00:22:31.038
And of course the value of land
next period depends on what the

00:22:31.038 --> 00:22:33.088
young in that period are willing
to pay,

00:22:33.088 --> 00:22:35.333
but they're thinking about what
they're willing to pay on the

00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:37.390
basis of what they expect to
happen the period after.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:39.710
So everybody has to think about
the guy after him,

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:41.637
and what the guy after him is
thinking about what the guy

00:22:41.637 --> 00:22:45.038
after him is thinking,
and it looks very complicated.

00:22:45.038 --> 00:22:47.737
And we want to solve for an
equilibrium which everybody can

00:22:47.737 --> 00:22:50.575
rationally anticipate what the
guy in front of him is going to

00:22:50.575 --> 00:22:52.992
do which means rationally
anticipate what that guy is

00:22:52.992 --> 00:22:56.250
rationally anticipating the guy
in front of him is going to do,

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:59.784
and you have to solve for the
whole equilibrium and see how it

00:22:59.784 --> 00:23:00.480
turns out.
 

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:04.308
Any questions about this?
 

00:23:04.308 --> 00:23:06.742
It looks very hard,
but it's going to turn out to

00:23:06.742 --> 00:23:07.910
be very, very simple.
 

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.950
Yes?
 

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:17.518
Student: For generation
0 why haven't we added the

00:23:17.518 --> 00:23:25.762
dividend that he would get from
holding the land in the second

00:23:25.762 --> 00:23:27.250
period?
 

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.796
Prof: By the way,
I haven't said what happens to

00:23:29.796 --> 00:23:31.068
the dividend in period 0.
 

00:23:31.068 --> 00:23:33.779
So actually I think that was a
good point.

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:35.880
So he gets 1.
 

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:42.715
He also gets the dividend in
period 0, so I'm glad you asked

00:23:42.715 --> 00:23:44.568
that question.
 

00:23:44.568 --> 00:23:48.459
So to answer your question,
remember the convention that

00:23:48.459 --> 00:23:52.347
we've made which holds in the
market and it's one of the

00:23:52.347 --> 00:23:55.460
reasons for the breakdown of the
market.

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.842
One of the reasons why the
market seized up in the last

00:23:59.842 --> 00:24:02.107
year or two,
or the last year,

00:24:02.107 --> 00:24:05.810
is because when you buy a stock
like the land somebody has to

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.759
give the money and the other guy
has to give back the stock,

00:24:09.759 --> 00:24:13.382
and the people buying and
selling are not actually meeting

00:24:13.382 --> 00:24:16.876
each other and simultaneously
transferring money for the

00:24:16.876 --> 00:24:18.528
ownership of the land.
 

00:24:18.528 --> 00:24:21.553
One guy's in San Francisco and
the other guy's in New York and

00:24:21.553 --> 00:24:24.130
they're doing it through some
screen or something.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.390
So the physical asset isn't
quite changing hands.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:29.643
So you have to make a
convention about when do you say

00:24:29.643 --> 00:24:31.730
the deal has actually concluded.
 

00:24:31.730 --> 00:24:34.150
So the convention is,
that we always use,

00:24:34.150 --> 00:24:36.874
is that if you buy the land at
time 0 you don't get the

00:24:36.874 --> 00:24:39.434
dividends--
at time t, if you buy the land

00:24:39.434 --> 00:24:43.055
at time t you don't start
getting the dividends until time

00:24:43.055 --> 00:24:43.500
t 1.
 

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:49.298
So if the young generation buys
the land at time 1 they don't

00:24:49.298 --> 00:24:53.548
get the dividend until starting
at time 2.

00:24:53.548 --> 00:24:57.861
So the very first dividend at
time 1 is going to go to the old

00:24:57.861 --> 00:25:00.900
guy at time 1,
which I had left out here.

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.512
So the old guy does get a
dividend, it's the dividend at

00:25:03.512 --> 00:25:05.509
time 1 because he began owning
the land.

00:25:05.509 --> 00:25:08.220
So he had it before,
so he gets that piece of land.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:13.766
Even though he's selling the
land at time 1 he still gets the

00:25:13.766 --> 00:25:17.484
dividend at time 1,
and the generation that bought

00:25:17.484 --> 00:25:20.798
it at time 1 doesn't start
getting dividends until time 2.

00:25:20.798 --> 00:25:23.945
So that was an excellent
question, and it was an

00:25:23.945 --> 00:25:26.490
oversight of mine,
so exactly right.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.019
And that's how it happens in
real life.

00:25:28.019 --> 00:25:31.467
Of course, the length of time
might be 3 days or it might be 1

00:25:31.467 --> 00:25:31.920
month.
 

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.529
It depends on the security,
what the settlement rules are,

00:25:35.529 --> 00:25:38.512
but there's always got to be a
break between when you buy the

00:25:38.512 --> 00:25:41.545
stuff and when you start getting
the dividends because it just

00:25:41.545 --> 00:25:44.328
takes time for the whole
physical process to happen.

00:25:44.328 --> 00:25:51.342
So they say t 3 is a very
common kind of settlement,

00:25:51.342 --> 00:25:52.578
or t 1.
 

00:25:52.578 --> 00:25:55.250
That means that in 3 days or in
1 day,

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:58.210
and so if you're desperate for
cash and you have to give--

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:00.517
so anyway, I won't get
into--we'll come back to this

00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:02.778
when we talk about the crisis
and what happened.

00:26:02.778 --> 00:26:07.211
So people who are desperate to
get stuff, it doesn't start

00:26:07.211 --> 00:26:09.700
coming for a little while,
so.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.279
Any other questions?
 

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:11.078
Yes?
 

00:26:11.078 --> 00:26:14.493
Student: Should we
multiply the price of apples by

00:26:14.493 --> 00:26:15.470
q_1?
 

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.470
Prof: Should I what?
 

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:18.824
Student: Should we
multiply what

00:26:18.824 --> 00:26:20.559
&gt;?
 

00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:28.430
Prof: Absolutely.
 

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:29.339
Very good.
 

00:26:29.339 --> 00:26:38.250
Any other comments?
 

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.858
All right, now how do you solve
this?

00:26:39.858 --> 00:26:42.140
Well, let's figure out how to
solve this.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.914
So the first thing you could
notice is that--so Fisher never

00:26:45.914 --> 00:26:49.817
thought of having infinite time
and never thought about Social

00:26:49.817 --> 00:26:50.650
Security.
 

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:51.710
Maybe he thought about Social
Security.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.250
I'm not aware that he had any
thoughts about Social Security.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.365
We didn't have Social Security
so it's unlikely he had been

00:26:57.365 --> 00:26:58.440
thinking about it.
 

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.838
So I don't think he thought
about time going on forever,

00:27:01.838 --> 00:27:05.048
but that doesn't mean his
methods aren't--

00:27:05.048 --> 00:27:09.190
he died, by the way,
in 1947, I think,

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:11.910
something like that,
so right around the time Allais

00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:12.869
wrote his paper.
 

00:27:12.869 --> 00:27:19.068
So what is it that he said?
 

00:27:19.068 --> 00:27:20.680
All his lessons are going to
hold true.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:26.115
The first thing he said is that
look, in every period there are

00:27:26.115 --> 00:27:28.660
qs on every side of things.
 

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.571
Here are q_t,
q_t,

00:27:30.571 --> 00:27:32.226
q_t 1,
q_t 1,

00:27:32.226 --> 00:27:33.259
q_t 1.
 

00:27:33.259 --> 00:27:37.827
So if you just double--there's
no loss in generality by taking

00:27:37.827 --> 00:27:40.298
all the q_ts to be 1.
 

00:27:40.298 --> 00:27:43.017
We have no theory of inflation
yet, because there's no money or

00:27:43.017 --> 00:27:43.500
anything.
 

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.284
So you might as well assume
we're measuring everything in

00:27:46.284 --> 00:27:48.720
terms of apples and take
q_t to be 1.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:51.818
So without loss of generality,
as they say,

00:27:51.818 --> 00:27:55.435
q_t = 1,
and of course that means we can

00:27:55.435 --> 00:27:58.608
divide every equation by
q_t.

00:27:58.608 --> 00:28:01.224
So pi_t divided by
q_t would go here and

00:28:01.224 --> 00:28:02.288
we'd have a 1 and a 1.
 

00:28:02.288 --> 00:28:05.798
We divide this one by q_t
1, still it's an equation.

00:28:05.798 --> 00:28:10.348
We have Z less than or equal to
1 pi_t 1 over

00:28:10.348 --> 00:28:15.489
q_t 1 1 times 1 times
theta, so we just re-normalize

00:28:15.489 --> 00:28:17.088
all the prices.
 

00:28:17.088 --> 00:28:38.150
So, re-normalize all nominal
prices in terms of apples.

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.305
So one simplifying thing is we
can get rid of--so think of

00:28:41.305 --> 00:28:44.460
pi_t as the price of
land in terms of apples.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:47.818
So we just get rid of all the
qs here.

00:28:47.818 --> 00:28:52.568
Just assume that they're 1,
and so we have this equation.

00:28:52.568 --> 00:29:05.548
And now that means that
pi_t = price of land

00:29:05.548 --> 00:29:15.588
at time t in terms of apples at
time t.

00:29:15.588 --> 00:29:18.750
So that was a normalization we
did many times before.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.944
We said that we might as well
assume the contemporaneous

00:29:21.944 --> 00:29:22.410
price.
 

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:24.137
We can't figure out what
inflation is,

00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:25.960
so let's figure there's no
inflation.

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.231
The price of apples is always 1
and we're going to measure the

00:29:29.231 --> 00:29:31.108
price of land in terms of
apples.

00:29:31.108 --> 00:29:34.058
So we get the same equation
that now looks a lot simpler.

00:29:34.058 --> 00:29:36.170
So the qs, we don't have to
really worry about.

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:41.500
We're just worrying about the
pis every period.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.200
So what did Fisher say to do?
 

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.390
So we've got to worry
about--what did Fisher say to

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:47.710
do?
 

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:52.999
What was his--whenever you have
an economy, a stock market

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:56.990
economy like this,
what did he say to do?

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:59.358
What was his advice?
 

00:29:59.358 --> 00:30:01.039
He said turn it into general
equilibrium.

00:30:01.039 --> 00:30:06.299
How?
 

00:30:06.299 --> 00:30:07.019
By doing what?
 

00:30:07.019 --> 00:30:07.788
Yeah?
 

00:30:07.788 --> 00:30:09.430
Student: Adjust the
endowments.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:21.896
Prof: So Fisher said,
Fisher's lesson,

00:30:21.896 --> 00:30:37.199
forget about assets by putting
their dividends into the

00:30:37.199 --> 00:30:41.450
endowments.
 

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.390
That's his first lesson.
 

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:51.818
So you see this is a good
summary of what we've learned so

00:30:51.818 --> 00:30:59.640
far, and a second lesson was
look at present value prices.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.980
So he says forget all these pis
and things like that.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.680
Just look at the present value.
 

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.132
So we're looking at
p_1,

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:10.660
p_2,
p_3 ...

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:17.936
where p_t,
price at time 0,

00:31:17.936 --> 00:31:25.618
let's say or time 1,
it doesn't matter,

00:31:25.618 --> 00:31:34.108
price at time 1 of an apple at
time t.

00:31:34.108 --> 00:31:36.358
So once you knew the presence
of the endowment then,

00:31:36.358 --> 00:31:38.884
I'm not going to write all
this, the endowment of all

00:31:38.884 --> 00:31:41.068
generations 1 and above it stays
the same,

00:31:41.068 --> 00:31:44.805
(3,1), (3,1),
(3,1), but the endowment of

00:31:44.805 --> 00:31:51.200
generation 0 is now 1,
1,1, 1,1, 1,1 forever.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:55.471
And the budget set,
everybody's going to have a

00:31:55.471 --> 00:31:58.630
budget set determined by the ps.
 

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:02.210
So now we're just one step from
solving this.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:06.838
So there's one more thing to
notice before we can solve it,

00:32:06.838 --> 00:32:19.896
so by symmetry,
so observe that by symmetry we

00:32:19.896 --> 00:32:36.145
can hope to find an equilibrium
with p_t 1 over

00:32:36.145 --> 00:32:48.529
p_t = p,
a constant.

00:32:48.529 --> 00:32:52.940
So every generation is the same.
 

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.486
The only relevant price for a
generation is the tradeoff

00:32:55.486 --> 00:32:58.309
between the price of goods when
they're young and the price of

00:32:58.309 --> 00:32:59.559
goods when they're old.
 

00:32:59.559 --> 00:33:00.788
That's what Fisher said.
 

00:33:00.788 --> 00:33:04.682
The veil of the stock market is
just a means of transferring

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:08.380
wealth between when you're young
and when you're old,

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.566
and really you should
calculate--all these guys have

00:33:10.566 --> 00:33:11.210
to calculate.
 

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:13.940
If I buy the stock now when I'm
young it's going to cost me a

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:16.489
certain amount of money and I'm
going to be able to get a

00:33:16.489 --> 00:33:16.990
return.
 

00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:21.980
So the real rate of return,
right, that they're all going

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.967
to calculate is going to equal--
we'll, by putting in

00:33:26.967 --> 00:33:32.546
pi_t dollars today
they get out pi_t 1

00:33:32.546 --> 00:33:36.150
the dividend,
1, tomorrow, right?

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:38.818
So tomorrow they're going to
get pi_t 1 1.

00:33:38.818 --> 00:33:43.307
So if they buy 1 share of stock
it costs them pi_t and

00:33:43.307 --> 00:33:46.368
tomorrow they get pi_t
apples,

00:33:46.368 --> 00:33:47.730
we're measuring in terms of
apples,

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.483
and in the future they get
pi_t 1 1 apple in the

00:33:50.483 --> 00:33:50.920
future.
 

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.990
So that's the real rate of
return.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.387
That's like 1 r,
1 r_t,

00:33:55.387 --> 00:33:59.210
but we're going to assume that
that's a constant.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:03.970
1 r we're going to guess it's a
constant and that's just 1 over

00:34:03.970 --> 00:34:08.039
this p that I told you about
before, the ratio p_t

00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:10.420
1, the present value.
 

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:15.952
So this ratio is just the
interest rate between time t and

00:34:15.952 --> 00:34:17.018
time t 1.
 

00:34:17.018 --> 00:34:19.637
So Fisher says you don't have
to think about all the stock

00:34:19.637 --> 00:34:22.393
market and what the return on
the stock market and all that's

00:34:22.393 --> 00:34:23.130
going to be.
 

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:24.449
Really you're just trading off.
 

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.577
By doing all that calculation
you're figuring out what's the

00:34:27.577 --> 00:34:30.280
tradeoff between time t goods
and time t 1 goods.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:33.030
In the Fisher economy you don't
look at the stock market.

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:36.063
You assume that everybody knows
the present value prices and

00:34:36.063 --> 00:34:39.150
therefore the tradeoff between
time t and time t 1 goods,

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:42.987
and we're going to assume
that's a constant because the

00:34:42.987 --> 00:34:46.896
thing's so symmetric how else
could it turn out except a

00:34:46.896 --> 00:34:47.820
constant.
 

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.219
So now we're ready to solve it.
 

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:53.199
We've done all the tricks,
almost, to solve it.

00:34:53.199 --> 00:34:59.199
So what is equilibrium going to
be?

00:34:59.199 --> 00:35:00.150
So here's equilibrium.
 

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:08.880
It's going to be a very simple
equation.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.766
At every generation you're
going to have an old and a

00:35:11.766 --> 00:35:12.210
young.
 

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:17.590
So what is the total supply of
goods in every generation?

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.679
How much goods are there?
 

00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:25.500
There's 1 for the old apple.
 

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.378
All right, if you look at any
generation like this one at time

00:35:28.378 --> 00:35:30.030
2 there's that one,
no not that one,

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:30.880
a little less.
 

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.389
The one in the middle that's
the 1 for the old guy,

00:35:34.389 --> 00:35:37.407
then there's the young guy who
has 3, right,

00:35:37.407 --> 00:35:41.199
and then there's the apple that
the land produces.

00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:53.030
So this is young apples and
this is the dividend of apples.

00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:55.280
So that's how many apples there
are in the economy.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.730
So who's going to be eating
them?

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.793
Well, there's going to be an
old guy eating apples and

00:36:01.793 --> 00:36:04.570
there's going to be a young guy
eating apples.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:07.980
So how much is the old guy
going to eat?

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.846
Well, the old guy's going to
spend half his money,

00:36:11.846 --> 00:36:14.530
and how much money does he
have?

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:18.481
Well, from his point of view
he's just trading off when he's

00:36:18.481 --> 00:36:20.489
young against when he's old.
 

00:36:20.489 --> 00:36:24.608
So from his point of view he's
got 3 apples when he's young

00:36:24.608 --> 00:36:28.262
plus 1 apple when he's old,
but that's worth,

00:36:28.262 --> 00:36:33.543
to him, the tradeoff between
apples when he's young and when

00:36:33.543 --> 00:36:38.139
he's old is just given by p,
divided by p.

00:36:38.139 --> 00:36:40.570
All right, so this is the whole
trick.

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:44.717
So we have to spend a minute
until this dawns on you why this

00:36:44.717 --> 00:36:45.409
is true.
 

00:36:45.409 --> 00:36:47.159
And now what's the young going
to do?

00:36:47.159 --> 00:36:49.800
The young generation,
what's their income?

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:53.670
Well, they only care about the
tradeoff between prices when

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.139
they're young and when they're
old.

00:36:56.139 --> 00:36:58.686
So when they're young and when
they're old they don't care

00:36:58.686 --> 00:37:00.159
about land according to Fisher.
 

00:37:00.159 --> 00:37:01.300
They don't have to think about
that.

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:04.393
They just have to know the
price, which we're assuming is p

00:37:04.393 --> 00:37:06.527
for everybody,
the tradeoff between young

00:37:06.527 --> 00:37:09.090
apples which are worth more than
old apples.

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:15.320
So to them they have the same
income 3 1 p.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.534
Now, these ps refer to
different time periods,

00:37:17.534 --> 00:37:19.010
but we're assuming the same.
 

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:21.000
Here's the young.
 

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.610
This is the young,
so this is divided by 1.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:32.920
So this is the young and this
is the old.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.643
And once I solve this equation
we'll have the whole

00:37:35.643 --> 00:37:37.110
equilibrium,
but we need to understand this

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:37.782
equation [note:
the equation is:

00:37:37.782 --> 00:37:39.128
(1 half times (3 1 p) over p 1
half times (3 1 p) over 1) = 1 3

00:37:39.128 --> 00:37:39.389
1 = 5].
 

00:37:39.389 --> 00:37:41.349
So where did I get this
equation?

00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:46.869
So let's take any time period 2
like T = 2 for example.

00:37:46.869 --> 00:37:50.119
We know the total apples around
that can be eaten are 5.

00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:51.340
That's on the right hand side.
 

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:55.603
The old guy's apple,
the young guy's 3 apples and

00:37:55.603 --> 00:37:59.690
the land producing 1 apple,
5 apples in all.

00:37:59.690 --> 00:38:01.539
Now who's going to be eating
the apples?

00:38:01.539 --> 00:38:04.103
There are going to be old guys
and there are going to be young

00:38:04.103 --> 00:38:05.030
guys, eating apples.
 

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:09.760
So the old will be the
generation 1 guys.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.485
They're going to be eating
apples, and then the generation

00:38:12.485 --> 00:38:14.349
2 guys are going to be eating
apples.

00:38:14.349 --> 00:38:17.925
Now, the generation 2 people
they've got 3 apples at time 2,

00:38:17.925 --> 00:38:21.260
so they're looking at 3,
but they've got expectations in

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.170
their head.
 

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.360
They're going to think ahead.
 

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.230
What's the price of stock
market today versus tomorrow?

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.409
Fisher says they do all that
thinking,

00:38:28.409 --> 00:38:31.851
they realize the tradeoff
between consumption at time t

00:38:31.851 --> 00:38:35.039
when they're young and
consumption at time t 1 when

00:38:35.039 --> 00:38:36.059
they're old.
 

00:38:36.059 --> 00:38:37.429
That's given by the price p.
 

00:38:37.429 --> 00:38:39.219
We've assumed there's a price p.
 

00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:40.940
So they're going to say to
themselves,

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.849
"Okay, I've got 3 apples
when I'm young,

00:38:42.849 --> 00:38:45.766
1 apple when I'm old is not
worth the same in present value

00:38:45.766 --> 00:38:48.197
terms--
it's just 3 1 P because the old

00:38:48.197 --> 00:38:51.769
apple's not worth as much at
time t as it as time t 1,

00:38:51.769 --> 00:38:52.869
it's 3 1p.
 

00:38:52.869 --> 00:38:56.077
I'm going to spend half of my
income and the price when I'm

00:38:56.077 --> 00:38:58.179
young I've assumed that's
one."

00:38:58.179 --> 00:38:59.579
So that's what the young are
doing.

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:02.110
The old guys,
now the old guys what they're

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:06.030
doing at time t depended on what
they did when they were young.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:08.920
But when they were young at
time 1,

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.829
they knew there was a tradeoff
between time 1 and time 2

00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:14.972
apples,
but we've assumed it's the same

00:39:14.972 --> 00:39:17.364
price tradeoff,
so we've assumed it's the same

00:39:17.364 --> 00:39:19.559
p, and so they did the same
calculation.

00:39:19.559 --> 00:39:22.090
When they were young they were
going to spend half their money,

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.039
this time 1 generation is going
to spend half its money when

00:39:25.039 --> 00:39:28.278
it's young,
half its present value when

00:39:28.278 --> 00:39:31.257
young, divided by--
so when they were young they

00:39:31.257 --> 00:39:33.396
were going to do that,
but when they're old now

00:39:33.396 --> 00:39:36.041
they're looking forward to
spending half their present

00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:38.829
value when they're old,
and the price of apples when

00:39:38.829 --> 00:39:41.809
they're old is given by p
relative to when they're young.

00:39:41.809 --> 00:39:44.717
So they're going to spend 1
half times the present value of

00:39:44.717 --> 00:39:47.148
their income,
divided by the present value of

00:39:47.148 --> 00:39:50.512
the price of the old apple which
is the apple we're talking about

00:39:50.512 --> 00:39:53.139
because they're consuming when
they're old now.

00:39:53.139 --> 00:39:56.500
So their consumption plus this
consumption equals 5.

00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:00.811
Now, at least half of you must
be baffled, so ask me a question

00:40:00.811 --> 00:40:03.940
to see if we can get to the
bottom of this.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:04.389
That's it.
 

00:40:04.389 --> 00:40:05.230
That's the whole equation.
 

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.414
As soon as we solve this we'll
figure out all the prices and

00:40:08.414 --> 00:40:10.250
everything in the whole economy.
 

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:15.170
And so we're at the end,
but this requires a little bit

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.539
of thought, so go ahead.
 

00:40:17.539 --> 00:40:22.610
Student: Shouldn't it be
4 1 p because there's the

00:40:22.610 --> 00:40:25.510
dividend, or maybe like 3 2 p?
 

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:26.219
Prof: No.
 

00:40:26.219 --> 00:40:28.139
Student: I mean,
where does the dividend fit in?

00:40:28.139 --> 00:40:29.789
Prof: That's a good
question.

00:40:29.789 --> 00:40:31.793
The dividend fit in here
because, yes,

00:40:31.793 --> 00:40:32.929
there's a dividend.
 

00:40:32.929 --> 00:40:36.367
Here's the dividend that got
produced, so there's an apple to

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.429
be eaten from the dividend,
right?

00:40:38.429 --> 00:40:42.351
Now, you're saying--so it's a
very important question you're

00:40:42.351 --> 00:40:42.949
asking.
 

00:40:42.949 --> 00:40:46.159
So it's correct what I wrote,
but it doesn't sound correct.

00:40:46.159 --> 00:40:47.652
So what he's saying,
the question is,

00:40:47.652 --> 00:40:48.980
what happened to the dividend.
 

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.623
This generation,
say, this young generation,

00:40:52.623 --> 00:40:55.760
either one, say the old
generation.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:59.219
The old generation,
when they were young at time 1

00:40:59.219 --> 00:41:02.889
they bought land looking forward
to their old age.

00:41:02.889 --> 00:41:05.469
They sold the land,
and they got the dividend.

00:41:05.469 --> 00:41:09.949
How come that's not factoring
in to their demand?

00:41:09.949 --> 00:41:11.380
That's his question, right?
 

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:15.188
The answer is because that's
precisely the point of what

00:41:15.188 --> 00:41:16.090
Fisher did.
 

00:41:16.090 --> 00:41:17.898
Fisher said,
yes, in the real world

00:41:17.898 --> 00:41:20.771
everybody is thinking to
themselves, like generation 1,

00:41:20.771 --> 00:41:22.050
"I'm young now.
 

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.420
I'm buying the land because
when I get old I'll be able to

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.460
resell it and I'll also get the
dividend."

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.829
But Fisher has thought ahead.
 

00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:31.679
Fisher's saying if the guy's
going to think about pi_t

00:41:31.679 --> 00:41:33.355
1,
that's what he'll be able to

00:41:33.355 --> 00:41:35.900
sell the land for,
and he's going to think about

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.320
the dividend he's going to get,
and his rate of return is

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.010
therefore divided by how much he
had to pay for the land today.

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:44.230
That's his rate of return.
 

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:47.871
But see, the bottom thing is
how many apples he had to give

00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:51.201
up, pi_t there,
is how many apples he had to

00:41:51.201 --> 00:41:52.960
give up to get the land.
 

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:56.516
The numerator is how many
apples he gets next period after

00:41:56.516 --> 00:41:59.199
selling the land and taking the
dividend.

00:41:59.199 --> 00:42:03.300
So that ratio is the tradeoff
between apples today and apples

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:04.940
in the future for him.
 

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:07.295
So if he says to himself,
what Fisher says,

00:42:07.295 --> 00:42:09.987
the only thing the guy cares
about is that ratio,

00:42:09.987 --> 00:42:12.007
that tradeoff,
which we're calling p,

00:42:12.007 --> 00:42:12.849
1 over p.
 

00:42:12.849 --> 00:42:15.920
That's the tradeoff he's going
to have in his mind.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.079
And so what is his income?
 

00:42:20.079 --> 00:42:22.510
This guy began with no land.
 

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:24.210
Only 0 began with the land.
 

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.789
Everybody else buys the land
only as a means of getting to

00:42:27.789 --> 00:42:30.050
more consumption when they're
old.

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.494
So the whole point of Fisher's
insight is you don't have to

00:42:33.494 --> 00:42:36.938
keep track of how the guy's
managing to get the payoff when

00:42:36.938 --> 00:42:37.710
he's old.
 

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:43.117
All he's doing is he's
recognizing a tradeoff of 1 r or

00:42:43.117 --> 00:42:45.338
1 over p,
that tradeoff between

00:42:45.338 --> 00:42:48.103
consumption when young and
consumption when old and all he

00:42:48.103 --> 00:42:50.724
can do is turn his endowment
when he is young into more

00:42:50.724 --> 00:42:52.860
endowment when he's old at that
ratio,

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:56.025
and it doesn't matter how he
does it as long as we have the

00:42:56.025 --> 00:42:56.789
right ratio.
 

00:42:56.789 --> 00:42:58.690
So Fisher says forget about the
assets.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:43:02.257
Just keep track of the present
value prices and these will tell

00:43:02.257 --> 00:43:05.824
you the ratio of transformation
of goods when young to when old

00:43:05.824 --> 00:43:08.989
and that's all you need to know
to make a decision.

00:43:08.989 --> 00:43:10.139
That's the whole point of
Fisher.

00:43:10.139 --> 00:43:12.018
You don't need to think about
the assets.

00:43:12.018 --> 00:43:16.380
Now, after we get the ps we'll
go back and figure out what the

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:17.739
price of land is.
 

00:43:17.739 --> 00:43:20.980
Any other questions?
 

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.280
Yes?
 

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.797
Student: Can you explain
again why the price of the

00:43:25.797 --> 00:43:27.280
second part is just 1?
 

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:30.639
Why can you use 1
&gt;?

00:43:30.639 --> 00:43:34.150
Prof: Yes,
because I'm taking p as the

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.789
ratio.
 

00:43:34.789 --> 00:43:41.889
So p, this p is here,
so it says if I had 1 apple at

00:43:41.889 --> 00:43:48.849
time t how many apples could I
get at time t 1,

00:43:48.849 --> 00:43:50.043
[correction:
1 over]

00:43:50.043 --> 00:43:53.534
p of them, right,
because this ratio--so for

00:43:53.534 --> 00:43:57.829
every apple I have down here I
can get [correction:

00:43:57.829 --> 00:44:00.579
1 over]
p apples at time t 1.

00:44:00.579 --> 00:44:03.157
If the ratio of two prices is p
it doesn't matter what their

00:44:03.157 --> 00:44:05.864
levels are--so I might as well
as think of one of them as 1 and

00:44:05.864 --> 00:44:06.869
the other one as p.
 

00:44:06.869 --> 00:44:10.340
I could think of the first one
as 2 and the second one as 2 p.

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.960
That would be the same thing,
right?

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:18.447
So if I thought of the first
price as 2 and this price as 2 p

00:44:18.447 --> 00:44:21.889
I'd put a 2 here,
a 2 here, and a 2 here and it

00:44:21.889 --> 00:44:24.059
wouldn't change anything.
 

00:44:24.059 --> 00:44:26.849
Remember, we learned this the
very--

00:44:26.849 --> 00:44:29.092
this is why the lessons of
general equilibrium they seem so

00:44:29.092 --> 00:44:31.568
obvious and then you put them in
a slightly different context and

00:44:31.568 --> 00:44:33.039
you realize how clever Fisher
was.

00:44:33.039 --> 00:44:36.404
If you double all the prices
you're not going to change

00:44:36.404 --> 00:44:37.090
anything.
 

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:39.139
It's the price ratios that
matter.

00:44:39.139 --> 00:44:41.762
So it's the tradeoff between
apples when young and apples

00:44:41.762 --> 00:44:42.840
when old that matter.
 

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.672
If you assume that tradeoff is
given by p you might as well

00:44:45.672 --> 00:44:48.081
assume that the first guy,
for all we care,

00:44:48.081 --> 00:44:51.672
he might as well assume that
he's measuring the prices when

00:44:51.672 --> 00:44:58.206
he's young in terms of 1,
and the prices when he's old in

00:44:58.206 --> 00:45:00.039
terms of p.
 

00:45:00.039 --> 00:45:01.849
Those were very good questions.
 

00:45:01.849 --> 00:45:06.210
This is a little confusing but
when we go back to the original

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.070
equilibrium it'll be clearer,
I think.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:12.789
But so that's the only equation
that we have to satisfy.

00:45:12.789 --> 00:45:15.019
So we can solve that equation
now.

00:45:15.019 --> 00:45:23.489
Any other questions?
 

00:45:23.489 --> 00:45:25.929
Let's solve that equation.
 

00:45:25.929 --> 00:45:29.177
That equation is I'm going to
multiply by 2 p,

00:45:29.177 --> 00:45:32.568
so I'm going to get 10 p on the
right-hand side,

00:45:32.568 --> 00:45:33.289
right?
 

00:45:33.289 --> 00:45:36.679
Because if I multiply by 2 p I
get 5 times 2 p is 10 p.

00:45:36.679 --> 00:45:47.242
On the left-hand side I'm just
going to get 3 1 p 3 p p

00:45:47.242 --> 00:45:49.199
squared.
 

00:45:49.199 --> 00:45:54.014
So if I rearrange I just get p
squared--uh-oh,

00:45:54.014 --> 00:45:56.690
my usual problems here.
 

00:45:56.690 --> 00:46:04.469
p squared - 6 p 3 = 0.
 

00:46:04.469 --> 00:46:10.599
p squared - 6 p 3 = 0,
so p = 6 (and I'm using the

00:46:10.599 --> 00:46:18.480
quadratic formula which I assume
you know) - b squared - 4--.

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:28.009
So 6 squared - 4 times 1 times
3, minus 12, over 2 = 6 - the

00:46:28.009 --> 00:46:32.369
square root of 24 over 2.
 

00:46:32.369 --> 00:46:36.329
So the square root of 24 is a
little bit less than 5,

00:46:36.329 --> 00:46:39.059
so this is going to be a little
bit more than 1,

00:46:39.059 --> 00:46:42.472
sorry a little bit less than 5,
so this will be a little bit

00:46:42.472 --> 00:46:44.449
more than 1,
so the whole thing will be a

00:46:44.449 --> 00:46:45.599
little bit more than a half.
 

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:50.780
So let's say it's .55.
 

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:53.289
So here's a crucial step.
 

00:46:53.289 --> 00:46:56.715
How did I know when I said 6
plus or minus,

00:46:56.715 --> 00:46:58.920
why did I take the minus?
 

00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.360
Because if I had taken 6 plus
this I would have gotten a

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.989
gigantic--well,
let's come back to that.

00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:07.916
So how did I know to take 6
minus that instead of 6 plus

00:47:07.916 --> 00:47:08.289
this?
 

00:47:08.289 --> 00:47:11.119
So if this is the p then what
are the prices?

00:47:11.119 --> 00:47:12.610
What are Fisher's prices?
 

00:47:12.610 --> 00:47:19.413
We've just solved for
equilibrium and these prices are

00:47:19.413 --> 00:47:26.217
going to be--we call this 1,1,
maybe .55, .55 squared,

00:47:26.217 --> 00:47:29.170
.55 cubed etcetera.
 

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:33.039
That's what Fisher says the
prices are.

00:47:33.039 --> 00:47:36.018
And we can now figure out
everybody's consumption.

00:47:36.018 --> 00:47:39.550
Y and Z, what's Y going to
equal?

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:44.001
Y is this thing on the right,
1 half 3 1 p,

00:47:44.001 --> 00:47:46.969
so it's .355 divided by 2.
 

00:47:46.969 --> 00:47:53.269
So that's 1.775.
 

00:47:53.269 --> 00:47:55.699
And what's Z?
 

00:47:55.699 --> 00:47:56.250
You should check.
 

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.050
I'm going a little fast here
for myself.

00:47:58.050 --> 00:48:04.130
3.55 divided by 2 is 1.775,
so what is Z?

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:19.527
It's going to be 1 and a half
plus--no, it's 3.5 divided by

00:48:19.527 --> 00:48:21.119
1.1.
 

00:48:21.119 --> 00:48:22.083
Student:
&gt;

00:48:22.083 --> 00:48:23.170
are those numbers
&gt;

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:26.143
Prof: p is .5--I'm going
too fast for you,

00:48:26.143 --> 00:48:26.639
ah ha!
 

00:48:26.639 --> 00:48:28.510
p is .55, right?
 

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:30.489
I just got p.
 

00:48:30.489 --> 00:48:32.507
So if I want a C now,
go back to consumption,

00:48:32.507 --> 00:48:35.030
what's the consumption going to
be when you're young?

00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:41.172
It's going to be,
Y is going to be 3 .55 divided

00:48:41.172 --> 00:48:46.998
by 2 which equals that,
right, 3 .55 that's the guy's

00:48:46.998 --> 00:48:51.019
income and he consumes a half
when he's young,

00:48:51.019 --> 00:48:53.570
so that's 1.775.
 

00:48:53.570 --> 00:49:01.679
And when he's old he's going to
have the same income,

00:49:01.679 --> 00:49:11.456
so 1.775 divided by p,
so it's going to be 1.775

00:49:11.456 --> 00:49:19.610
divided by .55,
and that you can see--no,

00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:24.018
that doesn't look right.
 

00:49:24.018 --> 00:49:31.277
Yeah, that divided by p and
that's going to be a little bit

00:49:31.277 --> 00:49:37.536
more than 3 and so,
in fact, if you solve it out it

00:49:37.536 --> 00:49:40.789
turns out to be 3.225.
 

00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:42.780
Did I go too fast there?
 

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.320
I'm plugging in .55 there.
 

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.309
So it's 3.55 divided by a half.
 

00:49:48.309 --> 00:49:52.326
That was that number,
1.775 divided by p which was

00:49:52.326 --> 00:49:54.025
.55,
so you can see it's a little

00:49:54.025 --> 00:49:56.974
bit more than 3,
because .55 into 1.7 is a

00:49:56.974 --> 00:49:59.110
little bit more than 3.
 

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:08.179
In fact, if you solve it out to
some decimal places it's that.

00:50:08.179 --> 00:50:10.320
So we've solved what everybody
does.

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.268
Now we know what everyone's
going to do.

00:50:12.268 --> 00:50:19.480
The young are going to spend
1.775, are going to consume

00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:25.380
1.775, they're going to consume
1.775 here.

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:26.570
They have an endowment of 3
apples.

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:27.949
They're not going to eat them
all.

00:50:27.949 --> 00:50:30.639
They're going to consume 1.775
of them.

00:50:30.639 --> 00:50:33.565
And then the old,
at the same time,

00:50:33.565 --> 00:50:35.460
what are they doing?
 

00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:39.393
They're consuming 3.225,
but you notice that those

00:50:39.393 --> 00:50:42.648
things add up to 5,
so the consumption when they're

00:50:42.648 --> 00:50:44.860
young plus the consumption when
they're old--

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:48.548
so the consumption of this old
guy there is 3.225 and you add

00:50:48.548 --> 00:50:51.757
the consumption of that,
yeah, I went too high there,

00:50:51.757 --> 00:50:55.019
the consumption of the young
guy just under him is 1.775,

00:50:55.019 --> 00:50:56.400
the two of them add up to 5.
 

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.170
That exactly clears the market.
 

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:02.023
So at time 2 you repeat the
same thing, at time 3,

00:51:02.023 --> 00:51:02.889
etcetera.
 

00:51:02.889 --> 00:51:07.648
So you see we've already
cleared all the markets except

00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:11.701
the one at time 1 which looks
more complicated,

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:15.050
but we've cleared all the
markets.

00:51:15.050 --> 00:51:19.329
Now, what's the price of land
going to be?

00:51:19.329 --> 00:51:22.010
What's the price of land?
 

00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.880
Nowhere to write that.
 

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.650
Let's write it here.
 

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:29.159
What's the price of land which
is going to be a constant?

00:51:29.159 --> 00:51:31.670
How do we figure that out?
 

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:38.579
How would Fisher say you figure
out the price of land?

00:51:38.579 --> 00:51:42.739
So the price of land at time 1,
say, what would Fisher say?

00:51:42.739 --> 00:51:43.420
Yep?
 

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.820
Student: Whatever the
young guy would pay for it?

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.849
Prof: That's one way of
getting it.

00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:51.969
So what's he paying for it?
 

00:51:51.969 --> 00:51:54.349
Student: Whatever he
doesn't spend on his

00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:55.059
consumption.
 

00:51:55.059 --> 00:52:01.679
Prof: Right,
so from this equation he spent

00:52:01.679 --> 00:52:02.760
1.775.
 

00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:08.518
His income was 3,
so what's left over?

00:52:08.518 --> 00:52:10.619
What did he spend on land
therefore?

00:52:10.619 --> 00:52:12.159
Student: 1.225.
 

00:52:12.159 --> 00:52:15.500
Prof: So the price of
land has to be 1.225.

00:52:15.500 --> 00:52:18.188
Now, that's not the way Fisher
suggested finding out the price

00:52:18.188 --> 00:52:18.630
of land.
 

00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:21.079
What did he say you should do?
 

00:52:21.079 --> 00:52:22.820
What's the fundamental theorem?
 

00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:24.230
Student: Present value
of all the payments.

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:26.820
Prof: And what is that?
 

00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:28.949
So the land pays 1 apple every
period.

00:52:28.949 --> 00:52:30.170
Student:
&gt;

00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:32.809
Student: So it's paying
1.

00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:37.289
Prof: So it's paying 1 p
1 times p squared 1 times p

00:52:37.289 --> 00:52:41.159
cubed 1 times p to the fourth,
right, because looked at from

00:52:41.159 --> 00:52:43.663
the point of view of time 1 you
get an apple next period

00:52:43.663 --> 00:52:45.119
relative to the apples today.
 

00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:46.440
That's worth p.
 

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:50.375
An apple in 2 periods is worth
p squared at time 1 because an

00:52:50.375 --> 00:52:53.916
apple at time 2 is worth p
apples at time 1 and worth p

00:52:53.916 --> 00:52:55.820
squared apples at time 0.
 

00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:59.907
So you just keep doing this,
but this is a perpetuity and so

00:52:59.907 --> 00:53:01.710
therefore it's equal to?
 

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:03.329
Student: 1 over r.
 

00:53:03.329 --> 00:53:06.219
Student: We're going to
&gt;.

00:53:06.219 --> 00:53:08.829
Prof: Yeah, 1 over r.
 

00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:13.449
So it's equal to 1 over r,
and so what's r?

00:53:13.449 --> 00:53:15.690
So what's r?
 

00:53:15.690 --> 00:53:17.469
How do we figure out what r is?
 

00:53:17.469 --> 00:53:21.489
Student: If we know p
then we can find r.

00:53:21.489 --> 00:53:31.304
Prof: 1 over 1 r = p,
right, = .55,

00:53:31.304 --> 00:53:44.949
so therefore 1 r = 1 over .55
and r = (1 over .55) - 1.

00:53:44.949 --> 00:53:52.739
And so this is a little less
than 2 - 1 is going to be like

00:53:52.739 --> 00:53:59.186
.81 or something,
and you take 1 over .81 and you

00:53:59.186 --> 00:54:02.409
get the same number.
 

00:54:02.409 --> 00:54:03.730
So Fisher solved everything.
 

00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:09.030
I mean, the Fisher method
solves it all.

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:12.039
Let's worry about time 1.
 

00:54:12.039 --> 00:54:12.659
We haven't done that.
 

00:54:12.659 --> 00:54:14.510
So what happens every period?
 

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:18.155
Every period like from 2
onwards, the young guys says,

00:54:18.155 --> 00:54:19.119
"Ah ha!
 

00:54:19.119 --> 00:54:21.380
I've got 3 apples.
 

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.539
What am I going to do with
them?"

00:54:22.539 --> 00:54:25.590
He says to himself,
"Well, the price of the

00:54:25.590 --> 00:54:29.291
land is 1.225 so I could eat
some of the apples or I could

00:54:29.291 --> 00:54:30.849
buy some land."
 

00:54:30.849 --> 00:54:32.219
And what does he decide to do?
 

00:54:32.219 --> 00:54:37.038
He says, "Let me eat 1.775
apples and spend the rest of my

00:54:37.038 --> 00:54:39.369
money buying 1 acre of land.
 

00:54:39.369 --> 00:54:40.659
Now, why am I doing that?
 

00:54:40.659 --> 00:54:45.103
Because next period I know the
price of land's going to be the

00:54:45.103 --> 00:54:48.820
same 1.225 and I'm going to get
a dividend of 1,

00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:52.599
so I'm going to be getting a
rate of return (we just

00:54:52.599 --> 00:54:55.119
calculated) of 81 percent."
 

00:54:55.119 --> 00:55:02.101
So this ratio up here,
this is another thing,

00:55:02.101 --> 00:55:11.780
this also this number is equal
to 1.225 1 divided by 1.225.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.559
That's also equal to 1.81.
 

00:55:16.559 --> 00:55:20.260
Remember r we just calculated
over here.

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:21.500
Where did I do r?
 

00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:23.409
r was 81 percent.
 

00:55:23.409 --> 00:55:27.110
That's the same number here,
81 percent.

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:30.213
So everybody says to himself,
"Given that there's an 81

00:55:30.213 --> 00:55:33.317
percent rate of interest I'm
happy to hold the whole unit of

00:55:33.317 --> 00:55:36.315
land because at that rate of
interest I'm just trading off

00:55:36.315 --> 00:55:39.050
consumption today for
consumption when I'm old at the

00:55:39.050 --> 00:55:40.840
rate that I want to."
 

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.320
And at time 0 the market clears
also.

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:48.972
So we cleared the market for
every time 2 through infinity,

00:55:48.972 --> 00:55:51.539
and that was by this equation.
 

00:55:51.539 --> 00:55:52.159
That was up here.
 

00:55:52.159 --> 00:55:56.043
By picking the right p we know
every market from T = 2 onwards

00:55:56.043 --> 00:55:57.000
was clearing.
 

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.601
And Fisher would say by Walras'
Law we don't have to worry about

00:56:00.601 --> 00:56:04.260
time 1, that's going to clear as
well and sure enough it does.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:05.949
It's a little bit different now.
 

00:56:05.949 --> 00:56:10.268
It's just the old guy,
but the old guy with his land

00:56:10.268 --> 00:56:13.739
which is 1.225 plus his dividend
of 1--

00:56:13.739 --> 00:56:25.329
his land which is worth 1.225
and his dividend of--

00:56:25.329 --> 00:56:33.170
hope I wrote down the right
price of land all this time.

00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:37.119
Oh, that would be bad.
 

00:56:37.119 --> 00:56:39.018
So the old guy, what does he do?
 

00:56:39.018 --> 00:56:45.302
He has his 1 apple plus he has
the land so he's going to

00:56:45.302 --> 00:56:50.099
consume--the old guy has
his--oh, I see.

00:56:50.099 --> 00:56:53.639
So what happens at time 1?
 

00:56:53.639 --> 00:56:56.806
The old guy has his dividend
that he had before,

00:56:56.806 --> 00:57:01.050
so he's got the dividend of the
land because he's owned the land

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:01.860
forever.
 

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:04.610
So he gets the dividend of 1,
so that's 1,

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:08.570
plus he has an endowment of
one, so he's consuming 2 now.

00:57:08.570 --> 00:57:11.710
Plus he sells the land for
1.225.

00:57:11.710 --> 00:57:15.960
So that all adds up to 3.225,
and then if you add the young

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.429
generation's 1.775 that indeed
clears the market at time 1.

00:57:20.429 --> 00:57:27.619
So the market's going to clear
in every single period,

00:57:27.619 --> 00:57:31.269
but we only had to solve it for
periods 2 and onwards which were

00:57:31.269 --> 00:57:33.530
all symmetric because by Walras
Law,

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:36.048
according to Fisher,
once it clears from time 2

00:57:36.048 --> 00:57:39.335
onwards without even bothering
to check we know it would have

00:57:39.335 --> 00:57:42.018
had to work at time 1 and sure
enough it did.

00:57:42.018 --> 00:57:44.108
So as I said,
let's summarize now what we've

00:57:44.108 --> 00:57:46.440
done and then we can start
drawing the lesson.

00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:49.130
So what we did is we started
with a complicated model with

00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:51.822
land and people having to look
forward and expect what the

00:57:51.822 --> 00:57:54.420
price of land was going to be
depending on what the next

00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:57.280
generation wanted to hold,
which depended on what they

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.929
were going to think the
generation of that were going to

00:57:59.929 --> 00:58:00.750
hold etcetera.
 

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:05.210
Very complicated stuff.
 

00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:07.389
And we saw that to solve it was
very simple.

00:58:07.389 --> 00:58:08.849
You just do the Fisher thing.
 

00:58:08.849 --> 00:58:13.233
If everybody's rational you can
forget about the assets and the

00:58:13.233 --> 00:58:17.547
land and turn everything into
present value prices and put the

00:58:17.547 --> 00:58:20.474
endowments--
so you forget about all the

00:58:20.474 --> 00:58:23.534
assets and just put the
dividends into people's

00:58:23.534 --> 00:58:27.260
endowments and look at all the
present value prices,

00:58:27.260 --> 00:58:30.170
and the present values prices
by symmetry,

00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:32.190
we're assuming,
just grow exponentially,

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:33.989
decline exponentially.
 

00:58:33.989 --> 00:58:37.659
And then we can solve the one
equation and figure out what

00:58:37.659 --> 00:58:41.454
that price was,
the exponential number p that's

00:58:41.454 --> 00:58:44.768
to the nth power gives the nth
price,

00:58:44.768 --> 00:58:48.231
the present value price,
so solving for that p we then

00:58:48.231 --> 00:58:49.670
cleared the markets.
 

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:52.208
We found out what everyone's
going to do when young and when

00:58:52.208 --> 00:58:55.072
old,
and by plugging in now Fisher's

00:58:55.072 --> 00:58:57.590
formula,
the price of every asset is the

00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:01.911
present value of its dividends,
we figured out what the price

00:59:01.911 --> 00:59:05.454
of land was every period,
so we've solved for the whole

00:59:05.454 --> 00:59:07.059
equilibrium and sure enough it
clears.

00:59:07.059 --> 00:59:09.699
And in equilibrium everybody's
doing this calculation.

00:59:09.699 --> 00:59:13.143
If I buy land today I'm going
to get that rate of return on

00:59:13.143 --> 00:59:15.400
the land which corresponds to
the p.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:24.860
It's going to be 81 percent,
and so everything works out.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:28.539
So what's this got to do with
Social Security?

00:59:28.539 --> 00:59:29.619
Are there any questions about
this?

00:59:29.619 --> 00:59:35.280
I sense a little bit of
puzzlement still.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:40.117
You shouldn't be that far away
from understanding it,

00:59:40.117 --> 00:59:42.630
so let's hear a question.
 

00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:44.469
What don't you don't understand?
 

00:59:44.469 --> 00:59:47.480
Just point to an equation you
don't understand.

00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:47.949
Yes.
 

00:59:47.949 --> 00:59:49.699
Good, brave of you.
 

00:59:49.699 --> 00:59:53.199
Student: How do we show
that theta should equal 1?

00:59:53.199 --> 00:59:58.219
Prof: So Fisher says
that--the way I solved it is I

00:59:58.219 --> 01:00:00.070
ignored the assets.
 

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:02.159
So I didn't pay attention to
what the assets were.

01:00:02.159 --> 01:00:03.980
I just put the dividends in the
endowment.

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.268
I didn't pay any attention to
what people were holding of the

01:00:07.268 --> 01:00:10.559
assets because Fisher says
forget the assets all together.

01:00:10.559 --> 01:00:13.018
Just do the present value
prices and augment the

01:00:13.018 --> 01:00:13.699
endowments.
 

01:00:13.699 --> 01:00:17.012
And I found the present value
prices by getting this factor p,

01:00:17.012 --> 01:00:20.268
and then it was just p to the n
and I found what everyone was

01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:21.409
going to consume.
 

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:23.768
That was it as far as Fisher's
concerned,

01:00:23.768 --> 01:00:27.478
but then Fisher says once we've
found general equilibrium we can

01:00:27.478 --> 01:00:31.244
go back to financial equilibrium
and figure out what the price of

01:00:31.244 --> 01:00:34.382
land is,
which is the present value of

01:00:34.382 --> 01:00:37.572
the dividend,
so it's price is 1.225,

01:00:37.572 --> 01:00:41.280
and the step I left out,
which you're asking about,

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.550
you can also figure out what
assets everybody's holding.

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:48.110
So Fisher's saying--what assets
are they holding?

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:53.320
Well, the guy,
he's consuming 1.775 here.

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:57.931
We figured out the price there
of 1.225 so it must be that he's

01:00:57.931 --> 01:01:02.322
holding exactly 1 unit of the
asset, and so the asset market

01:01:02.322 --> 01:01:03.809
is clearing too.
 

01:01:03.809 --> 01:01:04.889
But that's no accident.
 

01:01:04.889 --> 01:01:07.894
Fisher's saying if you clear
all the markets doing the

01:01:07.894 --> 01:01:10.675
present value general
equilibrium stuff and you go

01:01:10.675 --> 01:01:13.679
back to the financial
equilibrium you're automatically

01:01:13.679 --> 01:01:16.460
going to be clearing all those
markets too.

01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:21.561
So I left out the step because
somebody anticipated all that

01:01:21.561 --> 01:01:26.750
and got me to calculate the
price of 1 in a cheating way,

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.550
he said assume theta's 1 then
figure out how much money you're

01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:32.139
spending on the asset,
so we did that.

01:01:32.139 --> 01:01:35.260
What I should have done is done
Fisher's trick of figuring out

01:01:35.260 --> 01:01:38.163
the price of the asset,
which is 1.225 and then,

01:01:38.163 --> 01:01:40.396
of course,
we know the guy must have

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:43.349
bought 1 asset in order to use
up his budget set,

01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:45.739
but that clears the market for
assets.

01:01:45.739 --> 01:01:46.980
But Fisher knew that was going
to happen.

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:47.849
It always has to happen.
 

01:01:47.849 --> 01:01:51.170
That's the beauty of what he
did.

01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:52.059
Yes?
 

01:01:52.059 --> 01:01:54.449
Student: So in that
equation over there we have to

01:01:54.449 --> 01:01:55.559
assume p is less than 1?
 

01:01:55.559 --> 01:01:57.358
Prof: Yes,
so the point is,

01:01:57.358 --> 01:02:00.139
thank you, I'm coming back to
exactly that point.

01:02:00.139 --> 01:02:03.815
So the point is when you look
at the present value of land

01:02:03.815 --> 01:02:07.619
it's going to be p p squared p
cubed p to the fourth ....

01:02:07.619 --> 01:02:10.389
The present value of land had
better be finite,

01:02:10.389 --> 01:02:14.088
so in other words p has to be
less than 1 otherwise the value

01:02:14.088 --> 01:02:17.971
of land would be infinite and it
wouldn't make any sense because

01:02:17.971 --> 01:02:21.731
in the very first old guy with
an infinite value of land would

01:02:21.731 --> 01:02:25.429
buy more apples than there
possibly were in the world.

01:02:25.429 --> 01:02:29.335
So you know that the real
interest rate has to be

01:02:29.335 --> 01:02:30.230
positive.
 

01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:34.920
If the real interest rate were
less than 0, and you had some

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.340
asset that paid a constant
dividend forever,

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:41.840
that asset would have an
infinite value.

01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.628
So the presence of land,
which pays a constant asset

01:02:46.628 --> 01:02:52.170
forever, forces the real rate of
interest to be positive.

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:54.730
So Samuelson and all his talk
of negative real interest rates,

01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:55.780
it can't really happen.
 

01:02:55.780 --> 01:03:00.409
Land's going to pay some
dividend probably forever,

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:05.780
so there's going to be a
positive real rate of interest.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.940
And so it means in Social
Security,

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:11.570
if the young give up 1 to get 1
back when they're old they're

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:14.958
always going to be losing
because there's a positive real

01:03:14.958 --> 01:03:17.681
rate of interest,
and so every generation has to

01:03:17.681 --> 01:03:17.960
lose.
 

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:22.280
So it's precisely the point.
 

01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.318
Because of the presence of land
you know that the real rate of

01:03:25.318 --> 01:03:27.460
interest is going to have to be
positive.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.179
Fisher never made this argument.
 

01:03:29.179 --> 01:03:31.889
He said it's impatience and
maybe if people are incredibly

01:03:31.889 --> 01:03:34.219
patient it could even turn out
to be negative,

01:03:34.219 --> 01:03:35.949
or if output was bigger
[correction: smaller]

01:03:35.949 --> 01:03:38.110
next period than it is this
period you could even have a

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:41.056
negative rate of interest,
but not so when you have land

01:03:41.056 --> 01:03:43.079
with a constant dividend
forever.

01:03:43.079 --> 01:03:46.342
Then if the interest rate is
constant it'd better be

01:03:46.342 --> 01:03:49.989
positive, otherwise the land
would have infinite value.

01:03:49.989 --> 01:03:52.659
So it's a new argument for a
positive rate of interest.

01:03:52.659 --> 01:03:59.010
The land has to have a finite
value.

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:04.268
Any other questions?
 

01:04:04.268 --> 01:04:07.670
So when you solve for a couple
of these you're going to do it

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:10.097
very easily,
I mean, after you've done it a

01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:12.518
couple times this will seem very
easy to you.

01:04:12.518 --> 01:04:14.250
I know it seems a little
confusing now,

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.710
but let's just do a couple more
thought experiments.

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:18.440
Suppose we do Social Security?
 

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.590
What will happen with Social
Security?

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:22.320
How does that work?
 

01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:25.380
What does Social Security mean?
 

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:29.407
Well, Social Security means the
young give the old something and

01:04:29.407 --> 01:04:33.369
until now we talked about it as
if the young could give the old

01:04:33.369 --> 01:04:35.159
part of their endowment.
 

01:04:35.159 --> 01:04:37.882
The young pay taxes and the
taxes get handed over to the old

01:04:37.882 --> 01:04:38.159
guy.
 

01:04:38.159 --> 01:04:41.105
That's pay as you go and we
talked as if it wouldn't change

01:04:41.105 --> 01:04:44.559
the equilibrium,
but we said at the same time

01:04:44.559 --> 01:04:49.275
that Social Security was the
most gigantic program any

01:04:49.275 --> 01:04:54.257
government anywhere in the world
has ever adopted and the

01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:58.349
giveaway was bigger than GNP for
a year,

01:04:58.349 --> 01:05:01.150
17 trillion compared to 12 or
14 trillion.

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:04.340
So clearly it's going to have
an effect on the interest rate.

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.608
So we ought to take that into
account if we're doing a more

01:05:07.608 --> 01:05:09.750
careful analysis of Social
Security.

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:11.639
So what would Social Security
do?

01:05:11.639 --> 01:05:14.030
How would I take into account
Social Security?

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:18.429
Suppose every young person gave
1 apple to the old guy at the

01:05:18.429 --> 01:05:19.309
same time?
 

01:05:19.309 --> 01:05:23.960
How would I figure out what
happened in the new equilibrium?

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:33.409
How would the economy change?
 

01:05:33.409 --> 01:05:36.090
What would I change and solve
differently?

01:05:36.090 --> 01:05:55.090
 
 

01:05:55.090 --> 01:05:58.969
Well, all I would do is I would
change this to a 2.

01:05:58.969 --> 01:06:01.974
Every young guy now only has 2
apples when he's young because

01:06:01.974 --> 01:06:04.929
he's given 1 of them to the old
and the old would have 2.

01:06:04.929 --> 01:06:14.842
So all the way through here I
would just change all this to

01:06:14.842 --> 01:06:18.090
2,2, 2,2, 2,2,
2.

01:06:18.090 --> 01:06:19.119
That's what I would do.
 

01:06:19.119 --> 01:06:21.320
That's the change.
 

01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:23.110
Then I have to re-solve the
equilibrium.

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:25.139
So how would that change?
 

01:06:25.139 --> 01:06:31.280
What would I change in my one
equation?

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.090
Well, the apples in the
economy, the young apples,

01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:39.202
the guy's only got 2,
but the old's got 2 and there's

01:06:39.202 --> 01:06:42.210
still 1 apple coming from the
land,

01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:43.489
so that's still 5.
 

01:06:43.489 --> 01:06:45.583
But now every generation's
going to be behaving a little

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:46.268
bit differently.
 

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:50.014
They're going to have 2 when
they're young and 2 when they're

01:06:50.014 --> 01:06:50.389
old.
 

01:06:50.389 --> 01:06:53.664
This guy will have 2 when he's
young and 2 when he's old and

01:06:53.664 --> 01:06:55.440
otherwise it's the same thing.
 

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:59.768
So I just re-solve for the
equilibrium.

01:06:59.768 --> 01:07:10.547
So if I re-solve for the
equilibrium multiplying by 2 p

01:07:10.547 --> 01:07:18.730
I'll have 2 2 p 4 p multiplying
by 2 p.

01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:21.780
Sorry, I just confused myself.
 

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:23.650
I multiplied by 2 p.
 

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:28.849
I've got 2 2 p multiplying by 2
p.

01:07:28.849 --> 01:07:34.936
I have 2 p here,
plus multiplying by 2 p I have

01:07:34.936 --> 01:07:37.449
2 p squared here.
 

01:07:37.449 --> 01:07:39.920
Hope I'm doing this right.
 

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:42.860
And I've got 10 p on the right
like I had before.

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:49.945
So now I've got 2 p squared -
10 p and that's 4 p,

01:07:49.945 --> 01:07:56.019
so it's still 6 p (it looks
like) 2 = 0.

01:07:56.019 --> 01:08:08.159
And so p = 6 or - 36 - 8 over 4.
 

01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:13.182
And so that,
I hope I did that right,

01:08:13.182 --> 01:08:17.090
I hope you're checking it.
 

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:27.949
So that turns out to be p is
2.8, no.

01:08:27.949 --> 01:08:31.550
Social Security, p is .38 now.
 

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:43.288
So now it equals .38.
 

01:08:43.288 --> 01:08:51.659
So 6 - square root of 28 so
it's working out pretty much,

01:08:51.659 --> 01:08:59.730
so .38 is the new price,
so therefore the interest rate

01:08:59.730 --> 01:09:02.868
1 over 1 r = .38.
 

01:09:02.868 --> 01:09:04.800
So what do you think happens to
the interest rate?

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.162
So r now equals--before I write
it you can figure out what it is

01:09:08.162 --> 01:09:09.390
yourself in a second.
 

01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:12.707
Do you think the interest rate
went up or down in the new

01:09:12.707 --> 01:09:13.300
economy?
 

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.500
What would Fisher have said?
 

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.738
Student: Up.
 

01:09:16.738 --> 01:09:21.671
Prof: Up,
it went way up,

01:09:21.671 --> 01:09:27.238
and so it's actually 347
percent.

01:09:27.238 --> 01:09:31.632
So the interest rate went from
81 percent to--no that can't be

01:09:31.632 --> 01:09:32.210
right.
 

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:39.189
It went to 161 percent.
 

01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:40.590
So the interest rate went up.
 

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:43.920
So the loss is even worse than
it seemed before.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.474
Remember, in present value
terms, when you're young you

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:49.217
give up 1 and when you're old
you get 1 and so you lose the

01:09:49.217 --> 01:09:50.069
present value.
 

01:09:50.069 --> 01:09:54.625
So the present value of that
trade is this plus that over 1

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:54.939
r.
 

01:09:54.939 --> 01:09:57.420
Well, now that r has gone up
you're losing even more.

01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:00.626
So Social Security at the
current interest rates looks bad

01:10:00.626 --> 01:10:01.920
for every generation.
 

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:04.070
After you do the Social
Security and everybody

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:07.034
understands it's happening it's
going to be even worse in terms

01:10:07.034 --> 01:10:08.038
of present value.
 

01:10:08.038 --> 01:10:11.836
So Social Security,
again, everybody is giving

01:10:11.836 --> 01:10:15.380
something when they're young to
the old.

01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:18.591
So the guy at the very
beginning, at the very top,

01:10:18.591 --> 01:10:19.510
gains a lot.
 

01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:22.175
Everybody else,
every other generation loses

01:10:22.175 --> 01:10:25.954
and you can compute the utility
after Social Security compared

01:10:25.954 --> 01:10:29.859
to before Social Security and it
goes from something like 2.7 to

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:30.479
2.3.
 

01:10:30.479 --> 01:10:34.088
So there's a substantial loss
for everyone's utility except

01:10:34.088 --> 01:10:35.770
for the first generation.
 

01:10:35.770 --> 01:10:38.649
On the other hand we rescued
the first generation.

01:10:38.649 --> 01:10:40.779
Now, there are two more
experiments.

01:10:40.779 --> 01:10:42.445
I'm not going to be able to
finish today,

01:10:42.445 --> 01:10:43.779
but I'm going to mention them.
 

01:10:43.779 --> 01:10:48.792
Experiment one is suppose we
had more and more children every

01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:49.880
generation?
 

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.970
How would we take that into
account?

01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:56.198
Well, it's very simple to take
into account.

01:10:56.198 --> 01:11:00.944
The same thing with the trivial
change you can figure out what

01:11:00.944 --> 01:11:03.899
happens with more and more
children.

01:11:03.899 --> 01:11:05.069
So I'm going to go back to
(3,1).

01:11:05.069 --> 01:11:06.260
This will only take me one
minute.

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:06.880
Sorry about this.
 

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:12.752
I know time's running out,
but let me just finish this

01:11:12.752 --> 01:11:13.640
story.
 

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.038
So if we had more and more
children in every generation,

01:11:16.038 --> 01:11:19.609
so every 30 years let's say the
population doubled,

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.300
that's not such a high growth
rate per year,

01:11:22.300 --> 01:11:29.948
you'd have 6 and 2 here and
then it'd go up to 12 and 4.

01:11:29.948 --> 01:11:33.067
But, again, it's all
exponentially growing and the

01:11:33.067 --> 01:11:35.229
dividends would also be growing.
 

01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:39.859
So this would be 2 and 4 and 8
and 16 etcetera.

01:11:39.859 --> 01:11:43.408
But as you will see in a
second--I won't do it this time.

01:11:43.408 --> 01:11:46.173
Next time you'll see that it's
very easy to solve for the new

01:11:46.173 --> 01:11:46.819
equilibrium.
 

01:11:46.819 --> 01:11:49.175
You put a double here thing
because the young,

01:11:49.175 --> 01:11:50.850
there are twice as many young.
 

01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:53.060
You just solve it and you do
the whole thing.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:57.288
And what happens is Social
Security isn't solved.

01:11:57.288 --> 01:12:00.529
Samuelson was in a way wrong
again.

01:12:00.529 --> 01:12:04.880
Even though there are two young
people for every old person--so

01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:08.738
every young person only has to
give up half an apple.

01:12:08.738 --> 01:12:12.349
You only have to give up half
an apple when you're young and

01:12:12.349 --> 01:12:15.470
when you're old you still get a
whole apple back.

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:18.328
It sounds like now surely you
should gain, but the point is

01:12:18.328 --> 01:12:20.939
you don't because the rate of
interest gets higher.

01:12:20.939 --> 01:12:23.475
And then we're going to have
generations that alternate in

01:12:23.475 --> 01:12:26.011
size, but all these are very
easy to solve once you figure

01:12:26.011 --> 01:12:26.590
this out.
 

01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:29.717
So on Thursday you have to
solve a problem just like that

01:12:29.717 --> 01:12:32.622
so you get the hang of it,
just one problem to do for

01:12:32.622 --> 01:12:33.350
Thursday.
 

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:38.000

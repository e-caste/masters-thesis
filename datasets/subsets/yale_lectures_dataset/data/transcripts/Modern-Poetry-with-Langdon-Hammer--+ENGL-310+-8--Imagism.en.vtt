00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.627
Professor Langdon
Hammer: Last Wednesday,

00:00:15.627 --> 00:00:19.708
talking about the poetry of
World War I, we were talking

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:23.121
about poems written in the
period 1914 to 1918,

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.980
pretty much the period of the
First World War.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.683
This is a period that we've
already had a certain amount to

00:00:30.683 --> 00:00:34.026
say about.
It is the period in which Frost

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:37.684
starts writing,
publishes A Boy's Will

00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:42.090
in London and then North of
Boston in 1915.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.812
It's the same period in which
Yeats's work undergoes its

00:00:47.812 --> 00:00:54.055
important stylistic shift in
development in the volume called

00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:59.569
Responsibilities and
other books from the teens

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:04.459
exemplified in that little poem
"A Coat."

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:10.736
It is a period in which,
in London itself,

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:18.238
are gathered Frost,
Yeats, Pound and Eliot – all

00:01:18.238 --> 00:01:27.730
poets we'll study – not simply
gathered but interacting,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.288
talking to each other,
reading each other's work and

00:01:31.288 --> 00:01:34.080
giving each other ideas and
criticism.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:42.194
Another figure in this milieu
and of this moment is the poet

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:48.737
H.D.
Here, she is in a photo from

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:56.700
1915 with a locket in a poetical
pose.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.390
Let's see, I've some other
photos of the poet here.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.180
 
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.670
Let's see.
 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.849
 
 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:24.033
This is as an older woman and
in a familiar place,

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:27.716
seated.
She's on the left,

00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:32.930
well, on your left,
my right, with her companion

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.259
Brhyer right here.
 

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:39.504
And that nice man in the middle
is one of my predecessors in

00:02:39.504 --> 00:02:42.310
this position,
Norman Holmes Pearson,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.772
a professor of modern poetry:
one of the founders of American

00:02:47.772 --> 00:02:53.326
Studies at Yale and one of the
people involved in the creation

00:02:53.326 --> 00:02:58.515
of the incredible archive of
modern poetry in the Beinecke

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:03.725
Library,
where we have the papers of

00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:08.890
Ezra Pound; H.D.;
lots of materials from Williams;

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.440
 
 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.870
Langston Hughes;
and many other figures.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.214
Let's see, there she is on her
seventieth birthday in the nave

00:03:27.214 --> 00:03:29.930
of Sterling Memorial Library.
 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.590
Well, and this is over in the
Beinecke, too.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.169
That is her death mask.
 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:40.338
Well, we've gone a long way
from that young woman with the

00:03:40.338 --> 00:03:42.020
locket to this point.
 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.430
Let's return to her in her
youth.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.419
This is also over in the
Beinecke.

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:54.854
It's a photo of H.D.,
and it is inscribed,

00:03:54.854 --> 00:04:01.879
"To Marianne Moore," her friend
and Pound's friend.

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.297
On your handout,
you'll see the interesting

00:04:07.297 --> 00:04:12.198
anecdote relayed from Hilda
Doolittle's

00:04:12.198 --> 00:04:18.430
Autobiographies:
I had never heard of

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.779
vers libre until I
was discovered by Ezra Pound.

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:30.112
[Pound did a lot for modern
poetry, including naming H.D.]

00:04:30.112 --> 00:04:34.790
I did a few poems that I don't
think Ezra liked,

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.919
but later he was beautiful
about my first authentic verses

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.180
and sent my poems in for me to
Miss Monroe.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.682
[That is Harriet Monroe,
the editor, a very powerful

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:49.595
woman, of Poetry
magazine.]

00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:53.480
He signed them for me,
"H.D., Imagiste."

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.701
The name seems to have stuck
somehow.

00:04:54.701 --> 00:04:55.990
[H.D.,
Autobiographies]

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.444
Well, this is a wonderful
anecdote, sometimes told

00:05:00.444 --> 00:05:03.626
differently, in which Pound and
H.D.

00:05:03.626 --> 00:05:08.899
– as she would come to be
known – were conversing about

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:11.899
her poems in a coffee shop.
 

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:19.299
And Pound put at the end of
H.D.'s poems a new signature to

00:05:19.299 --> 00:05:26.954
them ("H.D.," that is) and at
the same time named the kind of

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:32.439
poet she was ("Imagiste") and
promptly,

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:35.757
since Pound is a great
entrepreneur,

00:05:35.757 --> 00:05:40.307
sent the poems off to be
published and to found a

00:05:40.307 --> 00:05:46.165
movement.
It's an interesting and telling

00:05:46.165 --> 00:05:50.071
story.
I suppose if--This was

00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:56.965
Poetry magazine,
its cover, where you see poems

00:05:56.965 --> 00:06:04.249
by Pound and others that
included H.D.'s work in the same

00:06:04.249 --> 00:06:08.498
volume.
There are a couple of things to

00:06:08.498 --> 00:06:11.620
be said about this little
anecdote.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.163
First of all,
there's the kind of complicated

00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:19.513
literary exchange of a man
telling a woman what to call

00:06:19.513 --> 00:06:21.671
herself,
and, in fact,

00:06:21.671 --> 00:06:26.619
doing it for her and sending
it, her name and her work,

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:33.620
to be published.
The name "Imagiste" is funny.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.736
It seems to,
well, it seems to evoke

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:43.500
something excitingly and
pretentiously foreign.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.473
And you could remember the
force of French painting in this

00:06:49.473 --> 00:06:52.371
period.
You know, everything that was

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:54.750
modern came from Paris,
it seemed.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:00.530
And here is Pound trying to,
in effect, create something,

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.930
some similar kind of public
relations excitement for poetry.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.344
"Imagiste" highlights,
well, it highlights the word

00:07:11.344 --> 00:07:16.817
"image," and it highlights the
visual, as if poetry were a kind

00:07:16.817 --> 00:07:20.230
of painting.
That's important.

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:26.644
And then there's the fact of
Hilda Doolittle's transformation

00:07:26.644 --> 00:07:30.370
into H.D.
I don't know.

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.230
Is the name Hilda Doolittle
insufficiently poetic?

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:42.801
The compression of that kind of
wonderfully homely American name

00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:47.699
into the enigmatic initials
"H.D."

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:53.642
seems emblematic of Imagist
aesthetics in general,

00:07:53.642 --> 00:08:00.676
which depend on the radical
compression of language and the

00:08:00.676 --> 00:08:06.959
conversion of,
well, the prosaic and everyday

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:09.420
to the essential.
 

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:16.319
And you could say that here
Pound is trying to do something

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:23.220
with the same ideal of extreme
economy with H.D.'s name.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.879
What was Imagism?
 

00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:32.898
This is a, well,
these are copies of H.D.'s

00:08:32.898 --> 00:08:39.777
poems as they appeared in
Poetry magazine,

00:08:39.777 --> 00:08:44.649
the poem "Hermes of the Ways."
 

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:48.435
H.D.
was – and there's her

00:08:48.435 --> 00:08:54.884
initials right here,
this new pen name she went

00:08:54.884 --> 00:09:01.293
under – she is writing,
even in this very early phase,

00:09:01.293 --> 00:09:05.744
poems that have classical
subjects and antecedents and are

00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:09.427
sometimes,
in fact, translations from

00:09:09.427 --> 00:09:15.070
classical sources from the Greek
anthology and others.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:17.913
Here is one,
"Epigram," after the Greek,

00:09:17.913 --> 00:09:22.070
and then here's H.D.'s name
followed by the "Imagiste,"

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:27.475
in quotation marks,
identification that Pound has

00:09:27.475 --> 00:09:30.062
introduced.
Imagism was,

00:09:30.062 --> 00:09:35.860
initially, marketed – I think
that's the fair word to use –

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:40.909
in a series of anthologies that
collected this new,

00:09:40.909 --> 00:09:46.702
exciting, representatively,
it seemed, modern poetry in an

00:09:46.702 --> 00:09:51.072
anthology called Des
Imagistes--again

00:09:51.072 --> 00:09:55.588
French-ified.
And then, you can see this is

00:09:55.588 --> 00:10:00.779
from 1914, and it's published in
London and New York.

00:10:00.779 --> 00:10:03.799
And then, well,
I'll tell you its table of

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:08.051
contents.
It's got poems by H.D.'s friend

00:10:08.051 --> 00:10:13.490
and lover, also a soldier poet,
Richard Aldington,

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.377
H.D.
herself, F.S.

00:10:15.377 --> 00:10:19.928
Flint and others,
including Amy Lowell and

00:10:19.928 --> 00:10:23.370
William Carlos Williams.
 

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:27.979
James Joyce appears here,
and Ezra Pound,

00:10:27.979 --> 00:10:34.777
who here has at least a couple
of poems that you've read for

00:10:34.777 --> 00:10:38.475
today.
This was followed a little bit

00:10:38.475 --> 00:10:42.971
later by this book called
Some Imagist Poets in

00:10:42.971 --> 00:10:45.376
1915.
At this point,

00:10:45.376 --> 00:10:50.556
Pound is no longer the master
entrepreneur,

00:10:50.556 --> 00:10:57.216
and the movement has rather
been taken over by the very

00:10:57.216 --> 00:11:04.986
amply represented Amy Lowell who
has become the primary exponent

00:11:04.986 --> 00:11:09.179
of Imagism already by 1915.
 

00:11:09.179 --> 00:11:14.864
And Pound has more or less
despaired of his own creation,

00:11:14.864 --> 00:11:21.056
Imagism, and now complains of
it as being merely "Amygism," as

00:11:21.056 --> 00:11:23.289
he referred to it.
 

00:11:23.289 --> 00:11:28.924
Amy, well, you can see in this
a kind of, oh you know,

00:11:28.924 --> 00:11:33.070
envy and competition on Pound's
part.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:37.865
He's unhappy that his little
group has been taken over by Amy

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:42.980
Lowell, and so he doesn't want
to have anything to do with it.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.388
Amy Lowell herself would later
become distressed at the

00:11:47.388 --> 00:11:51.552
proliferation of Imagism and
Imagists and attempt to

00:11:51.552 --> 00:11:56.129
copyright the name,
which she was unable to do.

00:11:56.129 --> 00:12:01.646
Well, this was her longest
statement of poetics,

00:12:01.646 --> 00:12:08.571
presented as a preface to that
volume, and I recommend it to

00:12:08.571 --> 00:12:13.166
you.
It's an interesting statement

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:16.955
of Imagism.
And here's a photo of Pound

00:12:16.955 --> 00:12:18.809
from the same period.
 

00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:23.927
Pound, despite Amy Lowell's
taking over of Imagism,

00:12:23.927 --> 00:12:29.352
remains the real theorist of
Imagism and the one whose

00:12:29.352 --> 00:12:35.288
formulations we still return to
in order to understand what

00:12:35.288 --> 00:12:38.853
Imagism was and,
to an extent,

00:12:38.853 --> 00:12:44.309
to understand some of the
essential aesthetic ideas and

00:12:44.309 --> 00:12:47.240
criteria of modern poetry.
 

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:52.156
On our handout,
you have Pound's rules – he

00:12:52.156 --> 00:12:58.190
liked to make rules – for
writing an Imagist poem.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:05.529
Happily, there are just three
of them, not too many:

00:13:05.529 --> 00:13:12.666
(1) Direct treatment of
the "thing," whether subjective

00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:17.091
or objective.
(2) To use absolutely no word

00:13:17.091 --> 00:13:21.190
that did not contribute to the
presentation.

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:27.268
[We can see even in his
telegraphic rules here he's

00:13:27.268 --> 00:13:30.429
trying to be economical.
 

00:13:30.429 --> 00:13:32.657
And:]
(3) As regarding rhythm:

00:13:32.657 --> 00:13:36.037
to compose in sequence of the
musical phrase,

00:13:36.037 --> 00:13:39.340
not in sequence of the
metronome.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:45.647
Well, these are each suggestive
and, as I say,

00:13:45.647 --> 00:13:51.382
important ideas.
And they're worth dwelling on

00:13:51.382 --> 00:13:57.364
to understand some of what
directs Pound's thinking and

00:13:57.364 --> 00:14:02.903
some of Pound's important
influence early on in the

00:14:02.903 --> 00:14:06.669
development of modern poetry.
 

00:14:06.669 --> 00:14:10.899
First of all,
that focus on the "thing."

00:14:10.899 --> 00:14:16.080
A poem is imagined here as an
image of a thing.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:21.139
There's a kind of empiricism in
this, isn't there?

00:14:21.139 --> 00:14:25.340
A kind of vaguely scientific
language.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.911
And if you look in Pound's
retrospect, when he goes back

00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:33.068
and reprints some of his writing
about Imagism and reflects on it

00:14:33.068 --> 00:14:36.639
in that essay that's in the back
of your anthology,

00:14:36.639 --> 00:14:42.396
you'll see Pound talking about
his wish to ally poetry with

00:14:42.396 --> 00:14:45.970
science rather than
advertisement.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:52.404
And here you can see him really
trying to do so in this stress

00:14:52.404 --> 00:14:56.940
on objectivity or the aim or
objectivity.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.988
Notice that the "thing" may be,
as he says, "subjective or

00:15:01.988 --> 00:15:06.256
objective."
But when we call it a "thing,"

00:15:06.256 --> 00:15:11.865
this has the effect of turning
even the subjective into

00:15:11.865 --> 00:15:17.059
something objective,
something oddly objective.

00:15:17.059 --> 00:15:19.612
And there's also,
in that first rule,

00:15:19.612 --> 00:15:22.589
a kind of emphasis on
directness, you know,

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:25.000
direct treatment of the thing.
 

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.049
That's important.
 

00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:32.138
All this leads to,
in Pound's second principle

00:15:32.138 --> 00:15:37.340
there, the idea of concision,
of efficiency.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:42.127
Nothing that does "not
contribute to the presentation":

00:15:42.127 --> 00:15:46.472
you know, "Hilda Doolittle,
your name is too long;

00:15:46.472 --> 00:15:50.259
H.D."
"Presentation";

00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:53.920
Pound doesn't say
"representation."

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.730
He says, "presentation."
 

00:15:56.730 --> 00:16:02.902
Again, there's an emphasis on
immediacy, directness,

00:16:02.902 --> 00:16:07.259
an ideal of presence,
if you will.

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:12.295
There is, in Pound,
a will to override or do away

00:16:12.295 --> 00:16:15.966
with mediation,
to bypass, in a way,

00:16:15.966 --> 00:16:19.340
the medium;
to make the word a thing;

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:23.289
to make the word an image and
the image a thing.

00:16:23.289 --> 00:16:29.623
"Direct" also implies a kind of
stripping down of rhetorical

00:16:29.623 --> 00:16:34.611
ornament – the idea,
again, that we saw in Frost

00:16:34.611 --> 00:16:40.059
that the truth is something you
arrive at through reduction,

00:16:40.059 --> 00:16:45.179
or in Yeats's little poem "A
Coat."

00:16:45.179 --> 00:16:51.296
And remember that Yeats and
Frost are coming to these ideas

00:16:51.296 --> 00:16:57.729
at just the same time that Pound
is finding these formulations

00:16:57.729 --> 00:17:00.259
for his own poetics.
 

00:17:00.259 --> 00:17:05.363
These ideas in Frost,
in Stevens--excuse me,

00:17:05.363 --> 00:17:10.109
in Frost, in Yeats – not in
Stevens,

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:15.257
importantly – and here
centrally expressed by Pound,

00:17:15.257 --> 00:17:21.279
these ideas all point to a kind
of radical skepticism in modern

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:26.329
poetry towards imagination and
towards rhetoric.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:32.081
There's a skepticism about
poetry's own illusion-making

00:17:32.081 --> 00:17:35.336
powers.
There's a kind of linguistic

00:17:35.336 --> 00:17:41.679
skepticism here.
And good poetry has a kind of

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:51.750
ascetic dimension for Pound,
or so it seems at this point.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:56.091
Finally, that third point about
prosody, that's important too:

00:17:56.091 --> 00:18:00.432
what Pounds calls the kind of
priority of "the musical phrase"

00:18:00.432 --> 00:18:03.349
over "the sequence of the
metronome,"

00:18:03.349 --> 00:18:09.459
the musical phrase over a kind
of bigger and regularized

00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:13.861
pattern.
That's a kind of privileging of

00:18:13.861 --> 00:18:20.233
the part, the smaller thing over
the whole and certainly over

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:24.042
repetition.
It's a privileging of

00:18:24.042 --> 00:18:28.910
individual detail over pattern
or sequence.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:34.063
It's a privileging of this idea
of the musical phrase over the

00:18:34.063 --> 00:18:37.950
abstract, or a kind of
continuous structure,

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:43.569
which is viewed as a kind of
mechanical discipline.

00:18:43.569 --> 00:18:47.863
All of these ideas are
rehearsed, again,

00:18:47.863 --> 00:18:52.487
by Amy Lowell,
and given sometimes somewhat

00:18:52.487 --> 00:18:55.020
different emphases.
 

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:58.680
And you can compare her account.
 

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:08.499
Well, let's look at some of
H.D.'s poems to see Imagism at

00:19:08.499 --> 00:19:16.940
work, as it were,
at least as practiced by H.D.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:22.109
 
 

00:19:22.109 --> 00:19:27.585
A number of the early poems
here in your anthology come from

00:19:27.585 --> 00:19:33.025
her book, Sea Garden,
a wonderful and fascinating

00:19:33.025 --> 00:19:38.926
first book that imagines the
poems themselves as constituting

00:19:38.926 --> 00:19:44.577
together a kind of,
well, sea garden – a kind of

00:19:44.577 --> 00:19:51.552
enclosed space – that offers
reflection on symbolic objects

00:19:51.552 --> 00:19:58.759
that suggest a kind of allegory
of poetic activity for H.D.

00:19:58.759 --> 00:20:04.087
in which flowers stand for kind
of poems, certainly kinds of

00:20:04.087 --> 00:20:06.963
feeling.
And the garden itself

00:20:06.963 --> 00:20:12.509
constitutes a certain kind of
pastoral, imaginative space.

00:20:12.509 --> 00:20:15.852
And H.D.
has classical sources for this,

00:20:15.852 --> 00:20:17.910
Greek models for this.
 

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.769
And the crucial poet for her is
Sappho.

00:20:22.769 --> 00:20:25.908
And like Sappho,
H.D.

00:20:25.908 --> 00:20:31.400
is a lyric poet of sexual
desire.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:41.015
You can see her translation of
Sappho's fragment 68 on page

00:20:41.015 --> 00:20:46.020
389.
Let's look at the poem "Garden"

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:53.913
on page 396, which gives a sense
of H.D.'s aesthetic--ascetic,

00:20:53.913 --> 00:20:56.630
aesthetic program.
 

00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.269
 
 

00:21:00.269 --> 00:21:06.171
Here, there's an address to the
rose, the traditional symbol of

00:21:06.171 --> 00:21:09.220
romantic beauty:
I You are clear

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:15.160
O rose, cut in rock,
hard as the descent of hail.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.750
I could scrape the colour
from the petals

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.770
like spilt dye from a rock.
 

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:27.260
If I could break you
I could break a tree.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:32.260
If I could stir
I could break a tree--

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:38.750
I could break you. II
O wind, rend open the heat,

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.950
cut apart the heat,
rend it to tatters.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.660
Fruit cannot drop
through this thick air--

00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:49.760
fruit cannot fall into heat
that presses up and blunts

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.420
the points of pears
and rounds the grapes.

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:56.120
Cut the heat--
plow through it,

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:01.089
turning it on either side
of your path.

00:22:01.089 --> 00:22:07.009
The rose, image of romantic
beauty: you could compare it to

00:22:07.009 --> 00:22:10.480
the rose in Yeats's early poems.
 

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.400
But here the image is
transformed.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:19.250
H.D.'s emphasis is not on its
softness or sweetness or sensual

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:23.470
abundance, its richness of color
or touch.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:29.060
Instead, the rose is "clear"
and "hard," just as an Imagist

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.470
poem is supposed to be.
 

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.390
It is cut in rock.
 

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:38.513
You could compare it to "Sea
Rose" on page 395,

00:22:38.513 --> 00:22:42.550
the page before:
Rose, harsh rose,

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:47.569
marred with stint of petals,
meager flower, thin,

00:22:47.569 --> 00:22:49.822
sparse of leaf,
[where again,

00:22:49.822 --> 00:22:53.201
it seems H.D.
is writing about her poem and

00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:55.440
its properties]
…

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.950
Stunted, with small leaf,
you are flung on the sand,

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:59.970
you are lifted
in the crisp sand

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.770
that drives in the wind.
 

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:06.510
Can the spice-rose
drip such acrid fragrance

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:12.277
hardened in a leaf?"
This is a poetry that wishes to

00:23:12.277 --> 00:23:18.690
convey to us an acrid fragrance
in hardened forms.

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:28.400
In "Garden," too, H.D.
 

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.795
is interested in a kind of
experience that is harsh or

00:23:33.795 --> 00:23:39.597
astringent, that would open
itself to elemental forces –

00:23:39.597 --> 00:23:45.400
here represented by the wind –
forces that suggest human

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:53.170
passion as much as weather,
and that would transform the

00:23:53.170 --> 00:24:03.094
poet's torpor and heat and do so
specifically through the action

00:24:03.094 --> 00:24:07.339
of cutting,
which is important.

00:24:07.339 --> 00:24:13.373
Here, and really in all these
early poems, H.D.'s poems take

00:24:13.373 --> 00:24:17.872
place as a kind of lyric drama
of apostrophe:

00:24:17.872 --> 00:24:21.525
that is,
the act of address through

00:24:21.525 --> 00:24:27.310
which a speaker finds her voice
by speaking in some relation to

00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:32.057
a part of the object world;
speaking to a thing,

00:24:32.057 --> 00:24:37.316
which she identifies with or
struggles against or both,

00:24:37.316 --> 00:24:41.796
as is the case,
I think, in the poems I've just

00:24:41.796 --> 00:24:46.042
read.
Here, too, you could see these

00:24:46.042 --> 00:24:50.405
images in H.D.'s poems as,
in some sense,

00:24:50.405 --> 00:24:55.641
things "subjective or
objective," to take Pound's

00:24:55.641 --> 00:24:59.210
phrase.
The extreme compression of

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:03.730
these poems expresses a kind of
wish for intensity,

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:09.564
as if by compacting things you
made them more fierce--sometimes

00:25:09.564 --> 00:25:14.713
a wish for breaking or cutting,
and, you might say,

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:20.519
fragmenting of things to get
down to essential parts;

00:25:20.519 --> 00:25:27.882
to do away with the,
let's say, lassitude of mere

00:25:27.882 --> 00:25:33.400
rhetoric;
and to cut to what is essential.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:45.263
Well, "Oread" is maybe H.D.'s
most famous poem from her early

00:25:45.263 --> 00:25:56.930
work and a poem often presented
as a paradigm of Imagism.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:05.083
If so, it makes us see Imagism
in somewhat different terms from

00:26:05.083 --> 00:26:08.240
those Pound presented.
 

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.786
It is, like the other poems
I've just been discussing,

00:26:11.786 --> 00:26:15.599
a kind of dramatic monologue,
which was not something that

00:26:15.599 --> 00:26:17.539
Pound's ideas emphasized.
 

00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:23.548
Here "Oread" is the name for a
wood nymph, and it indicates the

00:26:23.548 --> 00:26:28.770
speaker of the poem who says:
Whirl up, sea--

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:34.450
Whirl your pointed pines,
Splash your great pines

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:38.400
On our rocks,
Hurl your green over us,

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.799
Cover us with your pools of
fir.

00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:48.978
Again, there's a kind of lyric
act of apostrophe,

00:26:48.978 --> 00:26:54.589
of address, where what is
implored would be a kind of

00:26:54.589 --> 00:26:57.610
overwhelming experience.
 

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:02.520
Who or what exactly is Oread?
 

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.660
Is this nymph addressing?
 

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:10.210
It's hard to say.
 

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:13.577
Is she speaking,
in fact, to the sea as she

00:27:13.577 --> 00:27:16.588
seems to be?
"Whirl up, sea--… / splash

00:27:16.588 --> 00:27:18.410
your great pines over us."
 

00:27:18.410 --> 00:27:23.990
Or is she speaking to the woods
and the pines as if they were

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:28.069
the sea?
It's hard to decide.

00:27:28.069 --> 00:27:38.130
It is a poem that presents a
kind of enigma on that level and

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:45.339
doesn't resolve the question it
provokes.

00:27:45.339 --> 00:27:50.582
The very brevity of the poem
expresses a kind of wish for

00:27:50.582 --> 00:27:56.200
intensity that is right on the
edge of canceling the poem,

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.512
you could say,
leaving us nothing there at

00:28:01.512 --> 00:28:04.325
all.
A speaker, in this case,

00:28:04.325 --> 00:28:08.906
who wishes to be covered up,
to be subject to a greater

00:28:08.906 --> 00:28:12.943
force.
And the poem leaves us with

00:28:12.943 --> 00:28:19.248
this cognitive problem,
the difficulty of identifying

00:28:19.248 --> 00:28:25.432
what is figure or ground,
what is literal or what is

00:28:25.432 --> 00:28:29.759
metaphor.
That is, whether she is

00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:35.817
speaking to sea or pines,
seeing the sea like pines or

00:28:35.817 --> 00:28:38.789
the pines like the sea.
 

00:28:38.789 --> 00:28:48.046
"The Pool" is another enigmatic
poem here, one that poses

00:28:48.046 --> 00:28:53.440
questions.
Well, this problem that "Oread"

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.279
raises is, in fact,
one that you see in other

00:28:58.279 --> 00:29:03.230
Imagist poems,
the question of what is literal

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:06.309
and what is figurative.
 

00:29:06.309 --> 00:29:12.955
Pound, again,
theorizes this--the effects

00:29:12.955 --> 00:29:17.940
that I'm trying to describe.
 

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:26.817
In the middle quotation on your
handout, he speaks of the idea

00:29:26.817 --> 00:29:31.619
of instantaneity or suddenness.
 

00:29:31.619 --> 00:29:36.207
He talks about the poem as
constituting a "complex" of

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:40.882
elements held together,
made in some sense simultaneous

00:29:40.882 --> 00:29:44.741
with one another;
rather, you know,

00:29:44.741 --> 00:29:51.946
as "Oread" holds sea and pines
together in a way that asks us

00:29:51.946 --> 00:29:56.150
to see these elements as joined.
 

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:59.542
Pound says:
An "Image" is that which

00:29:59.542 --> 00:30:04.209
presents an intellectual and
emotional complex in an instant

00:30:04.209 --> 00:30:08.037
of time.
[And when he uses that word

00:30:08.037 --> 00:30:12.965
"complex," it has,
perhaps, certain resonances

00:30:12.965 --> 00:30:19.280
from psychoanalysis and also,
perhaps, from chemistry.]

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:25.687
It is the presentation of such
a "complex" instantaneously

00:30:25.687 --> 00:30:30.970
which gives that sense of sudden
liberation;

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:35.640
that sense of freedom from time
limits and space limits;

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:39.787
that sense of sudden growth,
which we experience in the

00:30:39.787 --> 00:30:42.859
presence of the greatest works
of art.

00:30:42.859 --> 00:30:46.688
[And then he says (one of my
favorite quotations):]

00:30:46.688 --> 00:30:50.824
It is better to present one
image in a lifetime than to

00:30:50.824 --> 00:30:55.418
produce voluminous works [Pound,
"A Few Donts by an Imagist,"

00:30:55.418 --> 00:31:00.365
Poetry]
You could see "Oread" as a poem

00:31:00.365 --> 00:31:05.704
wishing for and seeking that
"sense of sudden liberation"

00:31:05.704 --> 00:31:08.660
that Pound talks about here.
 

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:14.086
It's important,
again, that Pound emphasizes

00:31:14.086 --> 00:31:18.709
presentation.
It is the presentation rather

00:31:18.709 --> 00:31:24.640
than the representation of such
a complex, as he describes it.

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.029
How is presentation different
from representation?

00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:35.117
For Pound, the literary image
is not a memory of a prior

00:31:35.117 --> 00:31:40.029
reality, a reflection;
but is rather something more

00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:41.980
like a new experience itself.
 

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:47.940
Not an imitation of a thing,
but itself a kind of thing.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:52.065
Again, in Pound,
as Pound thinks about these

00:31:52.065 --> 00:31:57.150
things, there's a drive
specifically through technique

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:02.619
to arrive at a kind of
transparency beyond technique.

00:32:02.619 --> 00:32:07.844
This is also,
it should be emphasized,

00:32:07.844 --> 00:32:10.809
a Romantic project.
 

00:32:10.809 --> 00:32:15.182
The image gives a kind of
epiphany, a visionary

00:32:15.182 --> 00:32:18.890
experience, for both poet and
reader;

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:26.210
gives us sudden liberation from
historical particularities of

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.650
place and of time.
 

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:37.503
Let's look at Pound's own poem
"In a Station of the Metro,"

00:32:37.503 --> 00:32:46.204
which is on page 351 as an
important test case and example

00:32:46.204 --> 00:32:49.410
for this poetics.
 

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:57.670
 
 

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:05.062
It has the honor of being the
shortest famous poem in modern

00:33:05.062 --> 00:33:10.140
poetry.
You can memorize it.

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:16.055
"In a Station of the Metro" and
wonderfully, when I've said the

00:33:16.055 --> 00:33:20.539
title I've already said a third
of the poem:

00:33:20.539 --> 00:33:23.259
The apparition of these
faces in the crowd;

00:33:23.259 --> 00:33:28.440
Petals on a wet,
black bough.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:32.920
"In a Station of the Metro."
 

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:39.482
"The apparition of these faces
in the crowd," semicolon,

00:33:39.482 --> 00:33:43.420
"petals on a wet,
black bough."

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.150
Not many elements.
 

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:48.529
The title--how does it function?
 

00:33:48.529 --> 00:33:52.540
It functions as a kind of
locator.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.730
It places us somewhere.
 

00:33:54.730 --> 00:33:59.287
It places us specifically in
the Paris underground,

00:33:59.287 --> 00:34:01.839
in a station of the metro.
 

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:08.968
As I said, that title really
is, well, you could understand

00:34:08.968 --> 00:34:16.588
it as standing outside the poem
or really as a part of the poem

00:34:16.588 --> 00:34:19.597
itself.
Lines one and two,

00:34:19.597 --> 00:34:24.662
again, pose for us this
question of, "what is the figure

00:34:24.662 --> 00:34:26.780
and what is ground?"
 

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.835
What is being observed and what
is the metaphor it is

00:34:31.835 --> 00:34:35.159
generating?
Are we, in fact;

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:42.952
is Pound observing faces and
comparing them to petals on a

00:34:42.952 --> 00:34:45.550
wet, black bough?
 

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:51.210
Is he seeing both those things
in some sense?

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:57.407
We have here two elements
joined and compressed,

00:34:57.407 --> 00:35:02.369
radically.
Probably, it's wrong to speak

00:35:02.369 --> 00:35:06.564
here of metaphor or,
for that matter,

00:35:06.564 --> 00:35:10.806
simile.
But rather, we can use the word

00:35:10.806 --> 00:35:13.586
that Pound uses,
"image," or,

00:35:13.586 --> 00:35:19.144
as he would later call it,
"ideogram," borrowing from his

00:35:19.144 --> 00:35:22.420
ideas about Chinese writing.
 

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:28.164
The key to this poem,
as to other Poundian poems,

00:35:28.164 --> 00:35:32.119
is syntax.
Syntax is the temporal ordering

00:35:32.119 --> 00:35:36.508
of language, the ordering of a
sentence's unfolding and

00:35:36.508 --> 00:35:40.571
consequently the definition of
its elements and the

00:35:40.571 --> 00:35:43.010
relationships among them.
 

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:48.275
Pound has here a kind of
abbreviated parataxis,

00:35:48.275 --> 00:35:51.710
that is, a syntax of series.
 

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:56.380
Here, only two elements are in
that series.

00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:00.410
The series is joined by an
"and," usually.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:02.820
But here there is no "and."
 

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:08.002
Here, the syntax is compressed
in the service of rendering what

00:36:08.002 --> 00:36:11.924
is, in effect,
a new kind of perception:

00:36:11.924 --> 00:36:16.886
a perception that is modern,
urban, of the crowd,

00:36:16.886 --> 00:36:21.680
momentary;
but also, as Pound conceives

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.363
it, timeless,
pointing us allusively to

00:36:26.363 --> 00:36:30.800
historical and cultural
overlays.

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:35.851
We're in Paris,
but this literary form draws on

00:36:35.851 --> 00:36:42.219
Japanese verse models and
Japanese pictorial aesthetics.

00:36:42.219 --> 00:36:46.197
The time is now,
the present,

00:36:46.197 --> 00:36:51.147
"these faces."
This is self-consciously an

00:36:51.147 --> 00:36:57.197
image or picture of modernity,
but it's also the picture of an

00:36:57.197 --> 00:37:03.048
underground that inevitably
recalls the classical underworld

00:37:03.048 --> 00:37:08.998
and so also recalls the long
poetic history of comparing dead

00:37:08.998 --> 00:37:14.430
souls to leaves,
which you find in Homer,

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:17.449
Virgil, Dante,
Milton.

00:37:17.449 --> 00:37:23.777
Here, it's as if an epic simile
from one of those great poems

00:37:23.777 --> 00:37:30.210
had been taken out and presented
to us in fragmentary form.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:32.936
All of this,
this kind of rich,

00:37:32.936 --> 00:37:37.026
allusive overlay,
is created through a kind of

00:37:37.026 --> 00:37:42.570
stripping down to the poem's
essential, primary elements.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:47.653
Pound gives us the story of the
poem's composition here,

00:37:47.653 --> 00:37:52.645
which, whether it's true or
not, is an important poetic

00:37:52.645 --> 00:37:56.250
fable that stands behind this
poem.

00:37:56.250 --> 00:37:58.177
He says:
Three years ago [in your

00:37:58.177 --> 00:37:59.935
footnote]
in Paris, I got out of a

00:37:59.935 --> 00:38:03.373
'metro' train at La Concorde,
and saw suddenly a beautiful

00:38:03.373 --> 00:38:06.779
face, and then another and
another, and then a beautiful

00:38:06.779 --> 00:38:09.594
child's face,
and then another beautiful

00:38:09.594 --> 00:38:11.838
woman, [you know,
a whole series]

00:38:11.838 --> 00:38:15.697
and I tried all that day to
find words for what this had

00:38:15.697 --> 00:38:18.441
meant to me,
and I could not find any words

00:38:18.441 --> 00:38:21.131
that seemed to me worthy,
or as lovely as that sudden

00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:23.116
emotion.
[Again, suddenness.]

00:38:23.116 --> 00:38:26.657
And that evening… I was still
trying and I found,

00:38:26.657 --> 00:38:29.703
suddenly, [another experience
of suddenness]

00:38:29.703 --> 00:38:32.679
the expression.
I do not mean that I found

00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:35.679
words, but there came an
equation… not in speech,

00:38:35.679 --> 00:38:38.079
but in little splotches of
colour….

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:42.205
The 'one-image poem' is a form
of a super-position,

00:38:42.205 --> 00:38:45.836
that is to say,
it is one idea getting out of

00:38:45.836 --> 00:38:50.869
the impasse in which I had been
left by my metro emotion.

00:38:50.869 --> 00:38:53.659
I wrote a 30-line poem and
destroyed it….

00:38:53.659 --> 00:38:56.500
Six months later I made a poem
half that length;

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.974
a year later I made the
following hokku-like

00:38:59.974 --> 00:39:02.059
[haiku-like]
sentence.

00:39:02.059 --> 00:39:08.784
So there, interestingly,
this poem that purports to

00:39:08.784 --> 00:39:14.660
present – and "present,"
again, is the right word rather

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.608
than "represent" – a moment of
intense, vivid spontaneous

00:39:18.608 --> 00:39:22.028
emotion is arrived at,
as Pound describes it,

00:39:22.028 --> 00:39:25.309
through laborious technique and
overtime.

00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:30.113
And that technique is
concentrated specifically on

00:39:30.113 --> 00:39:32.045
what?
Compression,

00:39:32.045 --> 00:39:36.510
cutting things down and
eliminating words.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:43.438
Again, as in Frost's "Mowing,"
the truth is something you get

00:39:43.438 --> 00:39:48.750
down to by cutting away
rhetorical ornament.

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:54.100
Pound takes Japanese and
Chinese poetries as models for

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:57.369
this aesthetics of compression.
 

00:39:57.369 --> 00:40:02.155
And it's worth stressing that
on the one hand Pound is

00:40:02.155 --> 00:40:07.664
polemically writing in protest
against late nineteenth-century

00:40:07.664 --> 00:40:12.540
drawing rooms that are crowded
with bric-a-brac and the

00:40:12.540 --> 00:40:17.792
ornamental aestheticism of,
well, of a poet such as

00:40:17.792 --> 00:40:21.250
Swinburne or even the early
Yeats.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:26.023
And yet, Pound's taste for
Japanese and Chinese art comes

00:40:26.023 --> 00:40:29.860
right out of Victorian decadence
and--well,

00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.547
you can see this yourselves if
you look at the paintings of

00:40:34.547 --> 00:40:36.809
James Whistler and others.
 

00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:42.899
Pound is a polemical modernist
artist who is also really,

00:40:42.899 --> 00:40:48.010
as he looks right here,
a Victorian decadent.

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:55.909
For Pound, compression in
Japanese and Chinese poems means

00:40:55.909 --> 00:40:59.765
implication.
And that's what he's really

00:40:59.765 --> 00:41:01.610
interested in getting at.
 

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:06.167
In your RIS handout,
you'll see his translation of

00:41:06.167 --> 00:41:11.470
Li Po's "Jewel Stairs'
Grievance," as Pound renders it.

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:17.038
In Pound's handling, he says:
The jewelled steps are

00:41:17.038 --> 00:41:20.865
already quite white with dew,
[Again, this is a dramatic

00:41:20.865 --> 00:41:23.650
monologue]
It is so late that the dew

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:27.770
soaks my gauze stockings,
And I let down the crystal

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:31.304
curtain
And watch the moon through the

00:41:31.304 --> 00:41:35.164
clear autumn.
And then Pound,

00:41:35.164 --> 00:41:40.797
ever the teacher,
in his poems as elsewhere,

00:41:40.797 --> 00:41:46.300
says in his presentation of
this poem:

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.360
Note.--Jewel stairs,
therefore a palace.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:54.130
Grievance, therefore there is
something to complain of.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:57.280
Gauze stockings,
therefore a court lady [is

00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.329
doing the complaining],
not a servant who complains.

00:42:01.329 --> 00:42:04.616
Clear autumn,
therefore, he [he for whom she

00:42:04.616 --> 00:42:07.902
was waiting]
has no excuse on account of the

00:42:07.902 --> 00:42:10.749
weather.
Also she has come early,

00:42:10.749 --> 00:42:14.448
for the dew has not merely
whitened the stairs,

00:42:14.448 --> 00:42:16.619
but soaks her stockings.
 

00:42:16.619 --> 00:42:21.049
The poem is especially prized
because she utters no direct

00:42:21.049 --> 00:42:25.048
reproach.
Here, as Pound unfolds it for

00:42:25.048 --> 00:42:30.776
us, does his explaining for us,
the human situation is inferred

00:42:30.776 --> 00:42:35.579
from the scene because it is so
exactly rendered.

00:42:35.579 --> 00:42:39.541
And the power of sentiment is
felt, not through its direct

00:42:39.541 --> 00:42:43.920
expression but rather through a
kind of deliberate restraint,

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:47.002
"The poem is especially prized
because she utters no direct

00:42:47.002 --> 00:42:49.188
reproach."
Narrative here,

00:42:49.188 --> 00:42:54.352
in this poem as in other
instances of Pound's work,

00:42:54.352 --> 00:43:00.412
is displaced by the pictorial,
or you might say is not so much

00:43:00.412 --> 00:43:02.980
displaced as condensed in it.
 

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:08.093
All that matters of the story
of a lover's grief can be told

00:43:08.093 --> 00:43:12.135
in a quatrain.
Well, I'm going to finish in

00:43:12.135 --> 00:43:16.403
just a moment,
but I want to suggest a further

00:43:16.403 --> 00:43:22.000
dimension to this aesthetic that
I'm trying to describe.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.471
In other translations from the
Chinese, Pound – who didn't

00:43:27.471 --> 00:43:31.459
know Chinese,
and I'll say a little bit more

00:43:31.459 --> 00:43:37.209
about that next time – builds
a kind of layered narrative out

00:43:37.209 --> 00:43:41.289
of discrete images and finds a
way to,

00:43:41.289 --> 00:43:47.739
in a sense, not simply create a
poetry of radical compression,

00:43:47.739 --> 00:43:53.342
but rather a poetry that
expands out of this Imagistic

00:43:53.342 --> 00:43:56.347
basis.
The "River Merchant's Wife:

00:43:56.347 --> 00:44:00.315
A Letter" on page 352 is an
example, and it's one of the

00:44:00.315 --> 00:44:03.489
really great love poems of
modern poetry.

00:44:03.489 --> 00:44:07.760
Like the "Jewel Stairs'
Grievance," it is a dramatic

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:13.119
monologue for a female speaker,
but these are different poems.

00:44:13.119 --> 00:44:17.866
By the end of this one,
the wife speaks very directly,

00:44:17.866 --> 00:44:22.074
not in reproach but in
self-knowledge and pained

00:44:22.074 --> 00:44:25.478
desire.
The leaves fall early

00:44:25.478 --> 00:44:27.449
this autumn, in wind.
 

00:44:27.449 --> 00:44:31.440
The paired butterflies are
already yellow with August

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.810
Over the grass in the West
garden;

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:38.119
They hurt me.
I grow older.

00:44:38.119 --> 00:44:42.210
If you are coming down through
the narrows of the river Kiang,

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:46.630
Please let me know beforehand,
And I will come out to meet you

00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:52.162
As far as Cho-fu-Sa.
Of the paired yellow

00:44:52.162 --> 00:44:57.242
butterflies, the wife says with
sublime simplicity,

00:44:57.242 --> 00:45:01.480
"They hurt me.
/ I grow older."

00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:05.557
It's possible to forget that
the speaker who says this is

00:45:05.557 --> 00:45:07.450
sixteen, not thirty-six.
 

00:45:07.450 --> 00:45:10.519
But her age makes no difference.
 

00:45:10.519 --> 00:45:14.938
She is already grasping – as
you too will have – through,

00:45:14.938 --> 00:45:18.178
in this case,
the pain of her separation from

00:45:18.178 --> 00:45:22.670
her husband that the essential
experience of living in time is

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:25.514
loss.
With this recognition,

00:45:25.514 --> 00:45:31.157
Pound's poem reaches out of the
confines of its Imagism toward

00:45:31.157 --> 00:45:33.469
something much larger.
 

00:45:33.469 --> 00:45:37.999
And at the same time,
you see him carrying forward

00:45:37.999 --> 00:45:40.309
the Imagist's "don'ts."
 

00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:43.960
This poem is a direct treatment
of feeling.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.480
It uses absolutely no word that
does not contribute to the

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.828
presentation,
and it is composed in the

00:45:49.828 --> 00:46:00.299
sequence of the musical phrase,
not that of the metronome,

00:46:00.299 --> 00:46:15.000
with those dramatically varying
line lengths.

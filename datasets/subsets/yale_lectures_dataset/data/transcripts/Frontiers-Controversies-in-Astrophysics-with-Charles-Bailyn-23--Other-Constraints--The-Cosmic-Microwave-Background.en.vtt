00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.868
Professor Charles
Bailyn: We've been talking

00:00:03.868 --> 00:00:07.215
about the Type Ia
Supernovae and the data that

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:10.627
they provide about the expansion
and, as it turns out,

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:15.787
acceleration of the Universe.
And so, one way to summarize

00:00:15.787 --> 00:00:21.809
all that information is that
what we have found out--we now

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:26.170
know that the Universe is
accelerating,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.750
not just expanding,
but accelerating.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.895
And that acceleration comes
about because of some kind of

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:36.560
dark energy--or to turn it
around,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.910
the label we give to whatever
is calling that is dark energy.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.123
And this sometimes gets
summarized by this quantity,

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:49.163
which is the energy density of
the dark energy relative to the

00:00:49.163 --> 00:00:52.220
critical density of the
Universe.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.367
And the fact that it's
accelerating means that this

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:58.640
quantity must be greater than
this other quantity,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.797
the density of matter,
because the matter tends to

00:01:00.797 --> 00:01:03.547
pull things together.
And so, we know not only that

00:01:03.547 --> 00:01:06.242
it's accelerating,
we know something about how

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:10.144
much it is accelerating,
and that tells us how much

00:01:10.144 --> 00:01:15.330
bigger the dark energy density
is than the matter density.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:27.365
And we kind of know by how much.
We kind of know how much bigger

00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:33.980
this is than the dark matter
density.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.706
But somebody actually asked the
question that,

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:43.643
you know, I keep saying,
well, this is like 3/4,

00:01:43.643 --> 00:01:48.151
and this is like 1/4.
If you add a bunch of matter,

00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:51.330
couldn't you just add a bunch
of dark energy also,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.640
and end up with the same amount
of acceleration?

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.997
So, a comparable Universe.
And the answer is,

00:01:56.997 --> 00:01:59.366
yes, you could.
There's nothing in the

00:01:59.366 --> 00:02:04.071
supernova data that prohibits
this from being .5 and this from

00:02:04.071 --> 00:02:07.140
being 1,
as long as this is sufficiently

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.439
greater than that by the amount
necessary to give rise to the

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:16.983
observed acceleration.
And so, if you plot these two

00:02:16.983 --> 00:02:22.289
quantities against each
other--so, here's,

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:26.406
kind of, 0,0.
Actually, this can be negative,

00:02:26.406 --> 00:02:31.650
but let's not go there.
1,1.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:39.476
What you find out is that
there's a kind of allowed region

00:02:39.476 --> 00:02:47.990
that sort of looks like this,
allowed by the supernova data.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.987
Notice, this is--I'm assuming
throughout that the dark energy

00:02:51.987 --> 00:02:54.520
really is the Cosmological
Constant.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.282
I'm not thinking about Big Rip
scenarios at the moment,

00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:59.992
because that would add a third
dimension to this plot,

00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:02.090
and I don't want to do that
just yet.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:10.430
So, this is all assuming that
dark energy is the Cosmological

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.232
Constant.
But that's certainly a place to

00:03:13.232 --> 00:03:14.518
start.
There's no reason not to do

00:03:14.518 --> 00:03:16.234
that.
And so, I've been kind of

00:03:16.234 --> 00:03:19.402
consistently claiming,
as we've been talking about the

00:03:19.402 --> 00:03:22.690
course, that the real answer is
somewhere like here.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.292
Yeah?
That it's about .3 on the

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:31.067
matter side, .25 and about
3/4,2/3,3/4 on the dark energy

00:03:31.067 --> 00:03:32.646
side.
But, in fact,

00:03:32.646 --> 00:03:35.544
you could go--as far as the
supernova care,

00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:40.030
you could have no matter at all
and just a little dark energy,

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.328
or you could have a lot of
matter and a huge amount of dark

00:03:43.328 --> 00:03:45.664
energy.
And you'd get the amount of

00:03:45.664 --> 00:03:47.489
acceleration,
and therefore,

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.259
satisfy the observational
constraints.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:51.872
But, in fact,
it turns out,

00:03:51.872 --> 00:03:54.725
we know more than this,
because there are other

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:57.949
constraints on cosmology besides
the supernovae.

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.801
And, I have to tell you at this
point that this course,

00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:04.172
the way I've presented it,
is a little bit lopsided,

00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:07.731
because the other ways of
constraining these two

00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:11.819
quantities are just as important
as the supernovae,

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.349
and I'm going to do them all in
one lecture.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.323
And this is kind of in the
spirit of the philosophy of this

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:19.887
course, where we try and
understand a few things in

00:04:19.887 --> 00:04:22.524
depth,
rather than many things in

00:04:22.524 --> 00:04:25.747
breadth.
But I'm going to talk about two

00:04:25.747 --> 00:04:29.519
other kinds of constraints on
cosmology today,

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:32.182
which are, in fact,
just as important to modern

00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:35.114
cosmology as the supernovae are.
I like the supernovae,

00:04:35.114 --> 00:04:36.866
first of all,
because they were the first

00:04:36.866 --> 00:04:40.073
evidence of dark energy.
I still think they're the best

00:04:40.073 --> 00:04:43.658
evidence of dark energy.
But it's also true that I think

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.720
they're, in some ways,
the easiest to understand.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.683
That's not quite right.
What I mean is that you don't

00:04:49.683 --> 00:04:54.149
need a whole bunch of physics to
understand what's going on,

00:04:54.149 --> 00:04:57.378
because it's just the expansion
of the Universe,

00:04:57.378 --> 00:04:59.920
whereas some of these other
things,

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.917
as you will see,
there's moments where I'm going

00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:05.787
to have to say,
and then there's a whole bunch

00:05:05.787 --> 00:05:08.800
of complicated physics,
and then, you get the result.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.954
And so, it's less satisfying to
teach, and perhaps to learn,

00:05:11.954 --> 00:05:14.467
in a course like this,
but equally important for

00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:18.094
modern cosmology.
And what these other things do

00:05:18.094 --> 00:05:23.021
is they pick out where in the
allowed region--region allowed

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:27.530
from the supernovae,
the real Universe actually is.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.723
Okay.
So, with the understanding that

00:05:30.723 --> 00:05:35.033
either of the two things I'm
about to talk about could have

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:39.394
been five weeks of this course,
let's move in and I'll try and

00:05:39.394 --> 00:05:42.391
explain, in brief,
what these things tell us about

00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:44.612
the Universe.
The first is the Cosmic

00:05:44.612 --> 00:05:45.800
Microwave Background.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.559
This, we've encountered before.
This was one of the proofs that

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:58.896
the Big Bang really happened,
as opposed to the "steady

00:05:58.896 --> 00:06:01.193
state."
And, I don't know if you

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:04.740
remember what we said about
that, so, let me remind you.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.167
Recall what was going on.
You're looking back in time as

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:12.182
you look far away.
So, as you look back,

00:06:12.182 --> 00:06:18.491
things are denser and hotter.
And if you look back far

00:06:18.491 --> 00:06:22.853
enough, they get really hot.
So, let us imagine,

00:06:22.853 --> 00:06:28.173
we're looking at a redshift not
of 1 or .8 or something like

00:06:28.173 --> 00:06:31.420
that, but at a redshift of
3,000.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.221
So, this is when the Universe
was--the scale factor of the

00:06:35.221 --> 00:06:38.690
Universe was 3,000 times smaller
than it is today.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.199
At that time,
the average temperature of the

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:48.186
Universe, about 10,000 degrees.
Turns out, that's an

00:06:48.186 --> 00:06:51.848
interesting number,
because 10,000 degrees is how

00:06:51.848 --> 00:06:55.129
hot it has to be for hydrogen to
ionize.

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:57.670
Ionization, you'll remember,
is when the electrons

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:00.935
disassociate with the protons,
and then, you just have a whole

00:07:00.935 --> 00:07:03.110
bunch of charged particles
moving around.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.493
And it turns out--so,
before that,

00:07:05.493 --> 00:07:08.600
when the temperature is higher
than this,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.425
you imagine that the entire
Universe is basically filled

00:07:11.425 --> 00:07:15.111
with all this ionized hydrogen.
One of the features of ionized

00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:17.633
hydrogen, or indeed,
charged particles,

00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:20.620
generally, is that they tend to
be opaque.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.310
Photons don't propagate well
through these things.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.241
Photons propagate well through
neutral materials but not well

00:07:26.241 --> 00:07:30.993
through charged materials.
So, before that,

00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:37.780
the Universe was opaque.
It's like looking at the

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:40.720
surface of a star or a big wall
of opaque gas.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.253
You can't see any further.
So, it can't look back any

00:07:43.253 --> 00:07:45.887
further than that.
But if you look in any

00:07:45.887 --> 00:07:49.400
direction, and you're looking
far enough away,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.850
you ought to see a big wall of
10,000-degree hydrogen.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:56.491
And, in fact,
we know what a wall of

00:07:56.491 --> 00:08:00.792
10,000-degree hydrogen looks
like, because there are stars

00:08:00.792 --> 00:08:03.660
whose surfaces are 10,000
degrees.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.366
And the Sun's a little cooler
than that, but there are many

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:11.762
stars that are 10,000 degrees.
So, this should look like--so,

00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:18.915
in any direction you look,
you should see something that

00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:26.459
looks like the surface of a
star: hot ionized hydrogen.

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:32.350
And this looks like the surface
of a star.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.139
And we know that that's wrong,
right?

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:37.700
You can--let's go outside and
look up in some direction.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.667
If this were really true,
then anywhere you look,

00:08:40.667 --> 00:08:44.438
you would see the surface of a
star that's hotter and brighter

00:08:44.438 --> 00:08:47.014
than the Sun.
And so, the whole of the sky

00:08:47.014 --> 00:08:49.899
would look like the surface of
the Sun, only hotter.

00:08:49.899 --> 00:08:52.409
And obviously,
that isn't the case.

00:08:52.409 --> 00:08:56.153
And the reason that that's not
the case is because you have to

00:08:56.153 --> 00:09:00.550
remember how redshifted this is.
It's redshifted by a factor of

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.367
3,000.
So, the light has wavelengths

00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:08.080
that's 3,000 times longer than
the light we see from stars.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.824
So, let's work that out.
You'll recall,

00:09:10.824 --> 00:09:16.329
λ that you observed is equal
to λ_emitted,

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:19.484
plus Δλ.
Or, is equal to

00:09:19.484 --> 00:09:26.100
λ_emitted (1 +
Z), because Z is

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:32.691
Δλ / λ_emitted.
And so, this is equal to the

00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:35.860
wavelength emitted,
times 3,001,

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.680
right?
Here's the 1, here's the 3,000.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.039
We'll call that 3 x 10^(3).
And if the wavelength that's

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:46.940
emitted is a nice optical
wavelength like 5 x 10^(-7)

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:51.894
meters,
that looks green or yellow,

00:09:51.894 --> 00:09:57.190
times 3,000,
that's 15 x 10^(-4).

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.580
That's around 1 millimeter.
Wavelengths of a millimeter.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.545
Now, wavelengths of a
millimeter, you don't see with

00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:07.452
your eye.
These are, more or less,

00:10:07.452 --> 00:10:13.260
what we call microwaves.
So, the prediction really is

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:17.932
that in any direction you look,
you see a whole--you see what

00:10:17.932 --> 00:10:22.371
would have been something that
looks like the surface of a

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:24.576
star,
except it's redshifted so far

00:10:24.576 --> 00:10:27.183
that all you can see is
microwaves instead of ordinary

00:10:27.183 --> 00:10:29.620
optical light.
This is true.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:35.526
This has been verified
observationally,

00:10:35.526 --> 00:10:41.049
first in the 1960s.
This is true.

00:10:41.049 --> 00:10:54.149
There is a Cosmic Microwave
Background in any direction.

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:57.180
Take a microwave detector,
radio telescope.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.075
You point it in any direction.
You see this stuff coming from

00:11:00.075 --> 00:11:03.257
the Universe.
And this was taken,

00:11:03.257 --> 00:11:10.541
when it was first discovered,
as evidence for the Big Bang

00:11:10.541 --> 00:11:16.458
and against the steady state.
Because it was predicted by the

00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:19.820
Big Bang, because you assume
that the Universe was much,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.732
much hotter and much,
much denser in the past,

00:11:21.732 --> 00:11:24.070
which is what you need in order
to create this stuff,

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:26.269
and that by the time you're
seeing it now,

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.688
it's all redshifted.
Okay, so that's fine,

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:31.235
as far as it goes.
One of the features of the

00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:34.361
Cosmic Microwave Background
turns out to be that it's very

00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:37.690
smooth.
And you expect that to be true,

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:42.354
because you expect to see the
exact same thing in any

00:11:42.354 --> 00:11:45.277
direction.
It doesn't matter if you go

00:11:45.277 --> 00:11:49.054
back in time looking that way,
or back in time looking that

00:11:49.054 --> 00:11:51.071
way.
You expect the Universe to be

00:11:51.071 --> 00:11:53.980
denser and hotter in the past
and about the same way.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.703
And so, sure enough,
the Cosmic Microwave Background

00:11:56.703 --> 00:11:59.160
is pretty much the same
everywhere you look.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.990
Same everywhere.

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:09.009
And, as further experiments
were done, it really is very

00:12:09.009 --> 00:12:11.341
smooth.
And it came--it started to--

00:12:11.341 --> 00:12:15.230
the smoothness of this started
to become a little embarrassing,

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:19.450
because it can't be--you don't
want it to be perfectly smooth.

00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:24.240
Absolutely, totally identical
in all directions.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.949
Because the Universe,
at the moment,

00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:28.010
is not perfectly smooth.
We've got planets.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.779
We got people.
We got galaxies.

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:31.740
Then, we got big spaces where
there's nothing.

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.966
And so, if the Universe,
at the time of the Cosmic

00:12:34.966 --> 00:12:38.390
Microwave Background,
is going to evolve into our own

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.007
Universe now,
there must be some little

00:12:41.007 --> 00:12:44.899
perturbations that are going to
grow up to be galaxies later on.

00:12:44.899 --> 00:12:48.483
If it were perfectly smooth
then, it would have to be

00:12:48.483 --> 00:12:51.929
perfectly smooth now,
and that's manifestly not the

00:12:51.929 --> 00:12:57.886
case.
So, you suspect that there must

00:12:57.886 --> 00:13:06.494
be some irregularities,
because the Universe now is

00:13:06.494 --> 00:13:13.943
clearly irregular,
in the sense that it contains

00:13:13.943 --> 00:13:18.437
objects of various kinds.
And so, in the 1990s,

00:13:18.437 --> 00:13:20.653
it turns out,
you can see microwaves from the

00:13:20.653 --> 00:13:23.019
ground, but it's better to do it
from space.

00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:26.914
And so, in the 1990s,
they launched a satellite

00:13:26.914 --> 00:13:34.948
called COBE.
This is the Cosmic Background

00:13:34.948 --> 00:13:42.089
Explorer.
This is a satellite launched in

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:47.466
the early 1990s.
And COBE finally found the

00:13:47.466 --> 00:13:52.450
variations in the Cosmic
Microwave Background.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:57.370
And they were very small,
ten--1 part in 100,000.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.718
So, 10^(-5) to 1.
Now, that contrasts with the

00:14:01.718 --> 00:14:04.019
variations we see in the current
Universe.

00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:08.943
In the current Universe,
the variations in density can

00:14:08.943 --> 00:14:12.379
be 30 orders of magnitude,
10^(30).

00:14:12.379 --> 00:14:16.819
Remember, the average density
of the Universe is something

00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:20.090
like 10^(-27) kilograms per
cubic meter.

00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:25.519
In here, we've got 10^(3)
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:27.519
That's the density of water,
for example.

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:32.067
And so, the density of the
Universe now varies by 10^(30),

00:14:32.067 --> 00:14:35.100
but then, it only varied by
10^(-5).

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.028
So, the sixth decimal place in
the density was found to be

00:14:40.028 --> 00:14:42.838
variable.
The first five were always the

00:14:42.838 --> 00:14:45.419
same.
Now, 10^(30).

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:48.554
And so, that seems like this
Universe is quite different from

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:50.752
this Universe.
But there are ways that

00:14:50.752 --> 00:14:54.129
structure grows and that,
I'll come back to in a minute.

00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:55.787
That's the second thing I want
to talk about,

00:14:55.787 --> 00:14:57.884
is the growth of structure.
But, at least,

00:14:57.884 --> 00:15:01.360
there was some variation.
People were very excited about

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.830
this, because this,
again, is a situation where

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.332
something was predicted,
and then, you build a

00:15:06.332 --> 00:15:09.440
complicated piece of apparatus,
and you see what you predict.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.529
And that's always a good thing
to have happen.

00:15:11.529 --> 00:15:13.744
That gives you confidence that
you know what you're talking

00:15:13.744 --> 00:15:15.823
about.
And in their excitement,

00:15:15.823 --> 00:15:19.740
a number of scientists became,
sort of, overexcited.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.240
There's a famous quote from
Stephen Hawking.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.694
At the time,
he said--about the COBE

00:15:24.694 --> 00:15:28.340
results, he said it's like
seeing the face of God.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.080
This is a very dangerous thing
to say, because,

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.297
you know, most people in the
world don't understand how

00:15:34.297 --> 00:15:36.123
similes work.
So, he said,

00:15:36.123 --> 00:15:38.429
it's like seeing the face of
God.

00:15:38.429 --> 00:15:42.519
And this was reported:
Scientist Sees God.

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:46.990
So, you have to watch what you
say.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.688
And, you know,
the Weekly World News

00:15:49.688 --> 00:15:52.580
got a hold of this and then it
was trouble.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.507
All right.
So, they saw God by seeing the

00:15:55.507 --> 00:15:59.020
variations in the Cosmic
Microwave Background.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:03.990
Who knew?
All right, now, then.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.781
So, that was nice,
but COBE was just the first

00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:10.919
crack at this.
And, while they saw variations,

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:12.940
they didn't see it very
precisely.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:17.884
It was a pretty blurry image.
So, then, there was another

00:16:17.884 --> 00:16:23.559
satellite, still operating,
actually, called WMAP.

00:16:23.559 --> 00:16:35.399
WMAP is the Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe.

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:38.320
So, anisotropy means
irregularity.

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:42.374
Wilkinson--Dave Wilkinson was
one of the pioneers of this kind

00:16:42.374 --> 00:16:45.507
of radio astronomy,
and he was the leader of this

00:16:45.507 --> 00:16:48.083
project until he died shortly
before launch,

00:16:48.083 --> 00:16:50.539
and so, then,
they named it after him.

00:16:50.539 --> 00:16:57.384
And then, in 2003,
WMAP announced its results,

00:16:57.384 --> 00:17:04.837
and they got a much more
precise map of the Cosmic

00:17:04.837 --> 00:17:11.155
Microwave Background;
so precise that they could

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:15.220
measure the size of these
irregularities.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:19.510
Not just how irregular they
were, but how big they were.

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.722
And that, it turns out,
gives you cosmological

00:17:26.722 --> 00:17:28.659
information.
And I'll come back to that in a

00:17:28.659 --> 00:17:32.421
second.
But I want to start by showing

00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:35.340
you some pictures,
here.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:39.210
Let's see. All right.
This is the COBE results.

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.799
So, let me explain what you're
looking at.

00:17:40.799 --> 00:17:44.109
What you're looking at is a map
of the entire sky.

00:17:44.109 --> 00:17:47.420
They've projected it onto the
sky.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:52.445
And the way it works is this.
Down the middle here,

00:17:52.445 --> 00:17:56.139
that's the plane of the galaxy.
That's where the Milky Way is

00:17:56.139 --> 00:17:58.811
going to be.
And then, any position on the

00:17:58.811 --> 00:18:02.417
sky maps onto this oval.
And so, this is a common way of

00:18:02.417 --> 00:18:05.831
expressing the whole sky.
Now, this is actually kind of

00:18:05.831 --> 00:18:08.565
the raw data,
where red--I can't remember

00:18:08.565 --> 00:18:11.859
which way it goes.
I think red is slightly denser,

00:18:11.859 --> 00:18:13.539
or actually,
slighter hotter,

00:18:13.539 --> 00:18:17.079
is the way they measure it,
and blue is slightly cooler.

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:20.910
So, there's this kind of
yin-yang pattern here.

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.808
And that's because we're moving
in some direction through the

00:18:23.808 --> 00:18:25.990
Universe.
And so, if you look at the

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:29.289
Microwave Background in the
direction we're moving,

00:18:29.289 --> 00:18:34.199
then it's a little bit
blueshifted, which makes it look

00:18:34.199 --> 00:18:38.110
a little bit hotter.
Whereas, if you look back where

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.129
we're coming from,
that's a little bit redshifted,

00:18:41.129 --> 00:18:44.942
so it looks a little cooler.
And so, we're moving in this

00:18:44.942 --> 00:18:48.612
direction, away from here,
and that effect--it's a very

00:18:48.612 --> 00:18:52.485
small effect of our motion
through the Universe--turns out

00:18:52.485 --> 00:18:56.086
to dominate the irregularities
in the Cosmic Microwave

00:18:56.086 --> 00:18:58.350
Background.
But, of course,

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.541
that's not what we care about.
We want to see what the

00:19:01.541 --> 00:19:04.797
background itself is doing.
It's also true that that's

00:19:04.797 --> 00:19:08.695
quite easy to remove,
because we know how fast we're

00:19:08.695 --> 00:19:10.957
moving.
You can tell from this what

00:19:10.957 --> 00:19:13.509
direction we're moving in,
and also how fast.

00:19:13.509 --> 00:19:16.314
And you can just take that out
of the whole map,

00:19:16.314 --> 00:19:19.716
and adjust the map to be how we
would see it if we weren't

00:19:19.716 --> 00:19:22.790
moving anywhere.
That looks like this.

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:28.289
And now, there's a clear signal.
This is the Milky Way, here.

00:19:28.289 --> 00:19:32.650
There are sources of microwaves
that aren't the Cosmic Microwave

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.674
Background.
They're objects in our own

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:38.779
galaxy that emit a lot of
microwaves.

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:41.885
But the thing is that the
spectrum of the microwaves they

00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:45.378
emit is very different from the
spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave

00:19:45.378 --> 00:19:48.368
Background.
And so, if you take not just an

00:19:48.368 --> 00:19:50.874
image of this,
but you take an actual

00:19:50.874 --> 00:19:52.647
spectrum,
which they did,

00:19:52.647 --> 00:19:56.274
you can tell the difference
between things coming--emission

00:19:56.274 --> 00:19:59.919
coming from the background,
and emission coming from actual

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:03.345
objects in our own galaxy.
And so, you can take out the

00:20:03.345 --> 00:20:07.116
ones--you can artificially,
digitally, remove the objects

00:20:07.116 --> 00:20:10.214
that have the spectrum
associated with galactic

00:20:10.214 --> 00:20:12.300
objects.
And so, you can do that.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.660
You can take this out.
And that's what you end up.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:19.027
I should say that the scale
between red and blue changes by

00:20:19.027 --> 00:20:23.170
about a factor of 10 between
each one of these plots.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:25.136
And so, the difference between
red and blue,

00:20:25.136 --> 00:20:26.737
here, is much,
much smaller than the

00:20:26.737 --> 00:20:28.750
difference between red and blue
up here.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:32.650
Anyway, this was the face of
God, according to Hawking,

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.971
because it wasn't smooth,
and because you could,

00:20:35.971 --> 00:20:39.648
after some exhaustive error
analysis, convince yourself that

00:20:39.648 --> 00:20:43.326
you really believe that these
pieces of the Cosmic Microwave

00:20:43.326 --> 00:20:46.779
Background are actually hotter,
and therefore denser,

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:49.890
than these pieces of the Cosmic
Microwave Background.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:53.039
So, that was a big triumph.
And these irregularities,

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:56.324
then, grow up to be galaxies,
or groups of galaxies,

00:20:56.324 --> 00:20:58.900
or groups of groups of
galaxies, because,

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:01.723
you know, they're pretty big.
They extend,

00:21:01.723 --> 00:21:04.416
you know, some significant
fraction across the whole

00:21:04.416 --> 00:21:06.057
Universe.
This is, you know,

00:21:06.057 --> 00:21:09.358
a map of the whole Universe,
because it's mapping the entire

00:21:09.358 --> 00:21:11.355
sky.
So, they're not going to grow

00:21:11.355 --> 00:21:14.565
up to be individual galaxies,
but they are going to grow up

00:21:14.565 --> 00:21:16.779
to be irregularities in the
Universe.

00:21:16.779 --> 00:21:20.059
Okay, so now,
this is COBE in the 1990s.

00:21:20.059 --> 00:21:21.920
To compare that to the WMAP
results.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:28.410
Here is, on a different
visualization color scheme.

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.788
WMAP changed colors on us so
that you wouldn't get confused

00:21:31.788 --> 00:21:34.410
between their results and the
COBE results.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:39.119
So, this is the COBE map again
and this is what WMAP saw.

00:21:39.119 --> 00:21:42.279
And you can see that it's
seeing the same things.

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:46.519
This over-density here,
that's this stuff here.

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:48.558
This over here,
that's these,

00:21:48.558 --> 00:21:52.490
only it's seeing it much,
much, much more precisely.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.237
And, you know,
it's kind of the difference

00:21:54.237 --> 00:21:57.049
between a Hubble Space Telescope
image and a ground-based image.

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:59.387
It's seeing the same thing,
but the resolution here is

00:21:59.387 --> 00:22:02.053
much, much higher.
And you can see that you might

00:22:02.053 --> 00:22:05.680
have a chance of measuring the
size of some of these clumps in

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:09.128
this image in a way that you
wouldn't be able to do in this

00:22:09.128 --> 00:22:12.027

And so, that was what WMAP was

00:22:12.027 --> 00:22:15.922
about, was actually measuring
the sizes of these little bumps

00:22:15.922 --> 00:22:18.390
in the Cosmic Microwave
Background.

00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:21.019
So, why is that a good thing to
do?

00:22:21.019 --> 00:22:24.068
And here's where,
if I had five weeks,

00:22:24.068 --> 00:22:27.034
I'd explain that to you,
but I don't,

00:22:27.034 --> 00:22:32.567
so I won't.
So, let me just say that from

00:22:32.567 --> 00:22:39.829
the sizes, you can get
cosmological information.

00:22:39.829 --> 00:22:44.640
And I'm not going to tell you
how that works.

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.284
Basically, it comes about
because if you--what you find

00:22:49.284 --> 00:22:54.615
out from this is that there are
certain sizes-- the clumps like

00:22:54.615 --> 00:22:58.323
to be certain sizes,
and there are very few clumps

00:22:58.323 --> 00:23:01.269
that are other sizes,
so they're particularly favored

00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:03.822
sizes.
And the favored sizes turn out

00:23:03.822 --> 00:23:07.499
to relate to how old the
Universe is at that moment and

00:23:07.499 --> 00:23:11.380
what has been contained in the
Universe up until then.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.888
But I won't go into that in any
more detail except to say that

00:23:15.888 --> 00:23:19.509
the outcome of this is that what
you constrain,

00:23:19.509 --> 00:23:23.211
what you find out from this is
what they refer to

00:23:23.211 --> 00:23:25.987
Ω_tot,
which is the sum of

00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:29.380
Ω_λ and
Ω_matter.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:34.192
And this turns out to be equal
to 1, to as close as they've

00:23:34.192 --> 00:23:38.200
been able to measure it.
It's about 10% by now.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.942
One, probably plus or minus,
I don't know,

00:23:41.942 --> 00:23:43.819
0.1.
It's maybe a little better than

00:23:43.819 --> 00:23:47.199
that by now, a few percent.
But now, that's a very good

00:23:47.199 --> 00:23:49.813
thing to know.
Because, remember what this

00:23:49.813 --> 00:23:51.839
looked like from the supernovae
alone.

00:23:51.839 --> 00:23:55.319
The allowed region of the--so,
here's 1 and 1.

00:23:55.319 --> 00:23:58.911
The allowed region of the
supernovae looks something like

00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:01.619
this.
The Cosmic Microwave Background

00:24:01.619 --> 00:24:06.066
has these two things equaling 1,
and so, you force yourself to

00:24:06.066 --> 00:24:09.420
be on a straight line that looks
like that.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:13.407
And so, the two of these
experiments put together gives

00:24:13.407 --> 00:24:17.099
you a much better constraint on
what's going on.

00:24:17.099 --> 00:24:24.509
So, this is from the Microwave
Background.

00:24:24.509 --> 00:24:27.369
It's actually some kind of
region that looks like this.

00:24:27.369 --> 00:24:30.577
And so, now,
you've got an allowed region

00:24:30.577 --> 00:24:34.986
that's much smaller than either
of these two experiments

00:24:34.986 --> 00:24:38.476
individually.
Okay, as I said,

00:24:38.476 --> 00:24:46.453
there's a third constraint and
this comes about by the growth

00:24:46.453 --> 00:24:51.016
of structure.
You have to get from these tiny

00:24:51.016 --> 00:24:54.003
perturbations that,
after great effort,

00:24:54.003 --> 00:24:58.170
have been seen in the Cosmic
Microwave Background,

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:02.201
those had better grow up to be
galaxies or groups of galaxies

00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:07.093
or something.
So, at Z = 3,000 you

00:25:07.093 --> 00:25:13.042
have 10^(-5) perturbations.
At Z = 0,

00:25:13.042 --> 00:25:18.448
you have 10^(30) plus--even
greater than that,

00:25:18.448 --> 00:25:21.398
you know.
Basically a black hole is

00:25:21.398 --> 00:25:23.933
infinitely dense,
so I guess you could have

00:25:23.933 --> 00:25:27.193
infinite perturbations,
if you think about it from that

00:25:27.193 --> 00:25:30.337
point of view.
And you've got to get from one

00:25:30.337 --> 00:25:33.140
to the other.
So, how does this work?

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.810
Supposing you have a slight
over-density.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:45.279
Well, what happens?
The region that is over-dense,

00:25:45.279 --> 00:25:50.839
a little denser than the stuff
around it, has more gravity than

00:25:50.839 --> 00:25:54.915
the surrounding regions.
And so, it then pulls in

00:25:54.915 --> 00:25:59.121
material from the neighboring
areas, because the gravitational

00:25:59.121 --> 00:26:03.190
force on any particular piece of
mass will put it toward the

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.880
place where the matter is
densest,

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.800
because that's where the
gravity is coming from.

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.540
Pulls in nearby material.

00:26:13.599 --> 00:26:16.290
But, of course,
that action makes it denser,

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.606
because it's just pulled in
more stuff from the nearby

00:26:19.606 --> 00:26:22.859
region, and it makes the other
parts less dense.

00:26:22.859 --> 00:26:28.789
And so, this is a runaway
process.

00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:30.680
Then, the denser regions are
denser still.

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:34.269
They have yet more gravity.
They pull stuff in even faster.

00:26:34.269 --> 00:26:36.586
And so, you can start with tiny
perturbations,

00:26:36.586 --> 00:26:38.799
and they grow and grow and grow
and grow,

00:26:38.799 --> 00:26:42.302
until it becomes the difference
between a galaxy and not a

00:26:42.302 --> 00:26:47.480
galaxy, or a group of galaxies.
Turns out that the--even on the

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.868
WMAP plot, the kinds of
perturbations we're looking at

00:26:52.868 --> 00:26:58.255
are what's called large--this
leads to the Large-Scale

00:26:58.255 --> 00:27:03.657
Structure,
which is distributions of

00:27:03.657 --> 00:27:08.310
galaxies and galaxy clusters.

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:14.924
So, there's individual galaxies.
Galaxies like to live in

00:27:14.924 --> 00:27:17.067
clusters.
Turns out, the clusters are

00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:19.313
grouped together.
That's the Large-Scale

00:27:19.313 --> 00:27:24.325
Structure.
And you can plot this by

00:27:24.325 --> 00:27:31.671
using--by doing galaxy surveys.
And the problem with the galaxy

00:27:31.671 --> 00:27:34.579
survey is, how do you know where
it is in the third dimension?

00:27:34.579 --> 00:27:36.279
How do you know how far away it
is?

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:39.460
So, you have position in the
sky.

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:41.970
That tells you two of the
coordinates of a galaxy.

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:46.589
And then, you measure its
redshift.

00:27:46.589 --> 00:27:50.566
And you use the redshift in
order to make a guess at how far

00:27:50.566 --> 00:27:53.599
away it is, just from using the
Hubble Law.

00:27:53.599 --> 00:27:56.638
So, instead of trying to
determine the distance in order

00:27:56.638 --> 00:27:59.180
to measure the value of the
Hubble Constant,

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.115
you assume a value of the
Hubble Constant that you take

00:28:02.115 --> 00:28:04.890
from somewhere.
And then, if you measure--then,

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.397
you can--and,
once you've assumed the value

00:28:07.397 --> 00:28:10.341
of the Hubble Constant,
you can use redshift to tell

00:28:10.341 --> 00:28:12.380
you what the distance is
supposed to be.

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:18.233
And so, then,
you get a 3D map of the sky,

00:28:18.233 --> 00:28:24.799
and that tells us what the
structure is now.

00:28:24.799 --> 00:28:32.973
You can then compare that
to--you can then simulate the

00:28:32.973 --> 00:28:39.548
growth of structure by computer.
You start with the Cosmic

00:28:39.548 --> 00:28:42.348
Microwave Background,
with what you know about the

00:28:42.348 --> 00:28:49.599
Cosmic Microwave Background.
You apply the laws of gravity.

00:28:49.599 --> 00:28:52.704
And you can also put it in a
little dark energy if you feel

00:28:52.704 --> 00:28:55.755
like, to change how the--and
that actually does change how

00:28:55.755 --> 00:28:57.849
the growth works,
as you might imagine.

00:28:57.849 --> 00:29:02.574
But you can stick in any
cosmological parameters you

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:08.317
want, and just apply them as the
Universe grows from a redshift

00:29:08.317 --> 00:29:13.970
of 3,000 to now.
And then, you determine what

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:21.705
the simulation looks like now,
where now is defined to be,

00:29:21.705 --> 00:29:28.220
you know, 13.7 billion years
after you start.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:38.087
And you ask, does it look alike?
Look the same as the

00:29:38.087 --> 00:29:43.135
observations?
Now, along the way,

00:29:43.135 --> 00:29:47.531
when you're applying gravity in
all this stuff,

00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:53.552
you have to assume cosmological
parameters--how much dark energy

00:29:53.552 --> 00:29:57.074
there is,
but especially,

00:29:57.074 --> 00:30:04.594
how much dark matter there is.
Because, it's the matter that's

00:30:04.594 --> 00:30:09.730
pulling these density
perturbations together--how much

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:13.799
dark matter and some of its
properties.

00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:15.845
And so, then,
what you do is you just run

00:30:15.845 --> 00:30:18.250
your computer program a whole
bunch of times,

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.443
over and over again,
with different amounts of dark

00:30:21.443 --> 00:30:24.190
energy, dark matter,
and stuff like that.

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:28.388
And you see which one of these
simulations produces a Universe

00:30:28.388 --> 00:30:31.279
that actually looks like the one
we see.

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:42.589
So, which input parameters give
you the observations?

00:30:42.589 --> 00:30:45.424
So, this is,
in general, how computational

00:30:45.424 --> 00:30:47.013
science works.
This is how,

00:30:47.013 --> 00:30:48.585
you know, the big global
warming models,

00:30:48.585 --> 00:30:50.440
all these kinds of things of
work this way.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.726
You put in as much physics,
as much chemistry,

00:30:53.726 --> 00:30:56.210
whatever, as you can
understand.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:59.907
Make a big computer simulation.
You pick a set of starting

00:30:59.907 --> 00:31:01.424
conditions.
In this case,

00:31:01.424 --> 00:31:03.572
that's easy,
because you observe the Cosmic

00:31:03.572 --> 00:31:06.362
Microwave Background.
You run the thing for a while,

00:31:06.362 --> 00:31:08.549
and you ask,
does it look like real life?

00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:10.732
And to the extent that it looks
like real life,

00:31:10.732 --> 00:31:13.530
you believe that you've put in
all the important physics and

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.950
all the important science into
your simulation.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:18.616
Then you ask,
all right, given the results of

00:31:18.616 --> 00:31:21.585
this simulation that seems to
represent real life,

00:31:21.585 --> 00:31:24.089
what does it predict?
So, you can do things,

00:31:24.089 --> 00:31:25.934
for example,
in the global warming models,

00:31:25.934 --> 00:31:28.319
you add a whole bunch of carbon
to the atmosphere,

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:30.430
and then you ask,
now what's going to happen?

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:35.274
And with various results.
And so, this is a kind of

00:31:35.274 --> 00:31:38.867
example of a general kind of
science that is now more and

00:31:38.867 --> 00:31:42.973
more frequently being done--this
kind of computational simulation

00:31:42.973 --> 00:31:45.960
of reality,
which you then check in some

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.254
way against reality.
And then, to the extent that it

00:31:50.254 --> 00:31:54.991
works, you use it to predict
reality in other sets of

00:31:54.991 --> 00:32:01.907
circumstances.
So, let me show you some of

00:32:01.907 --> 00:32:05.200
that.
All right.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.619
Here's a map of the Universe.
These are observations.

00:32:07.619 --> 00:32:11.660
This is a famous redshift
survey.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.274
So, what you've got is redshift
going up this way,

00:32:14.274 --> 00:32:16.408
or actually,
they plotted in velocity and

00:32:16.408 --> 00:32:18.650
position on the sky in this
direction.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.619
This is kind of a slice of the
Universe, so it's got no third

00:32:21.619 --> 00:32:24.390
dimension coming out of the
blackboard, because they just

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.312
haven't used it.
And, you can see,

00:32:26.312 --> 00:32:28.924
each dot is a galaxy.
They are not distributed

00:32:28.924 --> 00:32:31.985
randomly in this plot.
This little guy,

00:32:31.985 --> 00:32:36.059
here, is obviously hugely
over-dense.

00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:38.878
And there are also places--they
think they're complete out to

00:32:38.878 --> 00:32:40.837
the edge here.
There are also places where

00:32:40.837 --> 00:32:43.330
they're almost no galaxies.
These are called voids.

00:32:43.330 --> 00:32:46.920
There are walls and voids.
And then, as they took more and

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.472
more slices to build up the
third dimension,

00:32:49.472 --> 00:32:52.500
they ended up having things
that look like this.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:56.000
And there are clear
over-densities at certain--this

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.623
is named the Great Wall.
There are clear over-densities

00:32:59.623 --> 00:33:02.750
in some places and clear
under-densities in others.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.759
And it turns out that the
Large-Scale Structure of the

00:33:06.759 --> 00:33:10.920
Universe is sort of like a
bubble, some soap bubbles.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.903
And so, they've got walls,
and then, there are voids in

00:33:13.903 --> 00:33:17.292
the middle of the walls.
And where those walls connect

00:33:17.292 --> 00:33:20.690
are particularly dense clumps.
Another way you can think about

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.930
it is that there are these kinds
of these filaments,

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:26.979
things that go through space
where there are unusually large

00:33:26.979 --> 00:33:29.988
numbers of galaxies.
So, the most recent redshift

00:33:29.988 --> 00:33:32.932
survey, which goes out much,
much further than the one I

00:33:32.932 --> 00:33:35.019
just showed you,
that was the first.

00:33:35.019 --> 00:33:37.730
That one sort of goes out to
here.

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:40.880
But now they've the 2DF,
Two Degree Field.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:44.539
This is a telescope that can
look at--measure the redshifts

00:33:44.539 --> 00:33:48.262
of galaxies within two degrees
of each other all at the same

00:33:48.262 --> 00:33:49.520
time.
So, you get many,

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.534
many redshifts.
I think they have close

00:33:51.534 --> 00:33:53.610
to--maybe 100,000 redshifts.
Here.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:57.339
Each blue dot is a galaxy.
And you can see the structure.

00:33:57.339 --> 00:34:00.752
You can see the structure
really cleanly with these void

00:34:00.752 --> 00:34:03.943
areas surrounded by walls.
And then, when the walls run

00:34:03.943 --> 00:34:06.227
into each other,
there are particularly dense

00:34:06.227 --> 00:34:08.912
clumps of galaxies.
So, that's the current

00:34:08.912 --> 00:34:13.257
structure of the Universe that
we want our simulation to end up

00:34:13.257 --> 00:34:14.730
looking like.
Yes?

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:16.663
Student: Why does
[Inaudible]

00:34:16.663 --> 00:34:18.596
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Oh,

00:34:18.596 --> 00:34:21.690
because after around here,
they stop being complete.

00:34:21.690 --> 00:34:24.229
They just don't see all the
galaxies, because there are

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:25.969
faint ones that they can't
measure.

00:34:25.969 --> 00:34:30.664
And so, beyond about here,
they're just not measuring all

00:34:30.664 --> 00:34:35.196
the galaxies that are there.
Okay, so now,

00:34:35.196 --> 00:34:45.780
let me show you a simulation.
Let's see. Come on.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.261
Here we go. All right.
I'll come back and I'll tell

00:34:48.261 --> 00:34:49.789
you what you're looking at in
just a second.

00:34:49.789 --> 00:34:55.070
But here is the evolution of
the Universe as done by

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:56.908
computer.
All right.

00:34:56.908 --> 00:34:59.980
So now, let me--where are we
starting from?

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.583
The redshift is up here.
And so, we're going to go from

00:35:03.583 --> 00:35:05.900
a redshift of about thirty,
when the Universe was thirty

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.614
times smaller than it is,
to a redshift of zero,

00:35:08.614 --> 00:35:11.056
which is today.
And we're going to look at this

00:35:11.056 --> 00:35:12.534
box.
This is a little chunk of the

00:35:12.534 --> 00:35:14.574
Universe.
Each one of these dots is

00:35:14.574 --> 00:35:17.656
supposed to be a galaxy.
Now, at a redshift of thirty,

00:35:17.656 --> 00:35:20.891
they're not galaxies yet.
They're just over-densities of

00:35:20.891 --> 00:35:22.698
gas.
Now, two things are going to

00:35:22.698 --> 00:35:25.090
happen, since a redshift has
started by now.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:27.519
One is that the box is going to
get thirty times bigger.

00:35:27.519 --> 00:35:29.500
The whole Universe is going to
expand.

00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.515
And that is included in the
simulation, but we're not going

00:35:32.515 --> 00:35:35.686
to include it when we make the
movie, because it makes it hard

00:35:35.686 --> 00:35:38.999
to see what's going on.
And so, if you'll remember the

00:35:38.999 --> 00:35:41.863
coordinate system,
the way it works is there's

00:35:41.863 --> 00:35:44.536
this scale factor times
x, y,

00:35:44.536 --> 00:35:47.774
z position.
We're taking the scale factor

00:35:47.774 --> 00:35:50.513
out.
So, this box is a single part

00:35:50.513 --> 00:35:52.942
of the Universe.
It's going to expand by a

00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:54.707
factor of 30,
but you're not going to see the

00:35:54.707 --> 00:35:57.296
expansion here.
All you're going to see is the

00:35:57.296 --> 00:36:00.344
motion in x,
y and z, not the

00:36:00.344 --> 00:36:02.894
scale factor,
as these things moved toward

00:36:02.894 --> 00:36:05.203
each other.
Now, as you start out,

00:36:05.203 --> 00:36:07.829
it looks like it's pretty
evenly distributed,

00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:10.396
but, in fact,
there are little perturbations

00:36:10.396 --> 00:36:13.024
in the density.
And what will happen is the

00:36:13.024 --> 00:36:15.786
galaxies will stream toward the
perturbations and the

00:36:15.786 --> 00:36:19.725
perturbations will get bigger.
And the--keep track of redshift

00:36:19.725 --> 00:36:21.971
up here.
The rate at which the redshift

00:36:21.971 --> 00:36:24.819
changes, varies with time,
because what we're actually

00:36:24.819 --> 00:36:26.485
counting, here,
is not redshift,

00:36:26.485 --> 00:36:29.212
but time steps.
And the relationship between

00:36:29.212 --> 00:36:31.219
time and redshift is not
obvious.

00:36:31.219 --> 00:36:35.673
So, let us take another look at
the growth of structure,

00:36:35.673 --> 00:36:38.687
here.
See them all moving towards

00:36:38.687 --> 00:36:43.945
each other, collecting in these
filaments, abandoning whole

00:36:43.945 --> 00:36:47.612
regions into voids.
And then, you end up--well,

00:36:47.612 --> 00:36:51.082
you end up back where you
started, the way this film loop

00:36:51.082 --> 00:36:53.364
works.
But let me show you a different

00:36:53.364 --> 00:36:55.590
visualization of exactly the
same data.

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:56.660
You know, this is all on the
computer.

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.937
You can do anything you want.
They make these great things

00:36:58.937 --> 00:37:01.437
where you sort of fly through
the Universe while it's evolving

00:37:01.437 --> 00:37:03.237
and stuff.
I don't think--That's amusing,

00:37:03.237 --> 00:37:04.969
but I don't think it's very
educational.

00:37:04.969 --> 00:37:08.057
One thing that is useful:
they took that box and they

00:37:08.057 --> 00:37:11.619
just kept rotating it as this
film looped right around it.

00:37:11.619 --> 00:37:13.868
And that's useful,
because you get to see these

00:37:13.868 --> 00:37:16.606
structures from different
angles, and I think it makes it

00:37:16.606 --> 00:37:19.250
easier to visualize.
So, let's try that.

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:23.085
See, it's the same simulation,
except the box is rotating,

00:37:23.085 --> 00:37:26.652
and so, you get a better sense,
I think, of what these

00:37:26.652 --> 00:37:32.239
structures actually look like.
I'll do it once more.

00:37:32.239 --> 00:37:34.823
As they collect into these
filaments and the filaments

00:37:34.823 --> 00:37:37.751
collect together.
And so, what you can do with

00:37:37.751 --> 00:37:41.755
the output of something like
this, with what it is at the

00:37:41.755 --> 00:37:43.900
very end--whoops,
I missed.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:47.853
Try it one more time.
Let me see if I can pause

00:37:47.853 --> 00:37:51.815
before it gets--before it
regroups.

00:37:51.815 --> 00:37:54.789
All right.
So, here is a small redshift.

00:37:54.789 --> 00:37:58.822
When you get to this point,
there are mathematical ways of

00:37:58.822 --> 00:38:01.440
saying, you know,
how clumpy is it?

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:06.138
How stringy is it?
And you can compare the results

00:38:06.138 --> 00:38:11.419
of simulations of this kind with
actual observations from the

00:38:11.419 --> 00:38:15.266
redshift surveys.
And so, in this particular

00:38:15.266 --> 00:38:22.639
case, it worked.
So, let me go back to

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:33.800
here--yes--oh,
it's down here--whoops.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.922
There we go.
There, that's where I want to

00:38:36.922 --> 00:38:39.863
be for the moment.
And the consequence of these

00:38:39.863 --> 00:38:42.807
kinds of things is,
it turns out that most,

00:38:42.807 --> 00:38:48.260
as I said before,
mostly what you constrain,

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:57.139
and so, you compare the
simulations to redshift surveys.

00:38:57.139 --> 00:39:01.720
And the consequence of that is
that you constrain the amount,

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.689
and also, to a lesser extent,
the type, the behavior,

00:39:05.689 --> 00:39:09.059
of dark matter.
Because it's the matter that's

00:39:09.059 --> 00:39:11.275
pulling things together.
And in a way,

00:39:11.275 --> 00:39:13.880
you can think about these
little clumps and filaments.

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.678
That's places where the
Universe has already stopped and

00:39:16.678 --> 00:39:18.332
contracted.
So, it had a little extra

00:39:18.332 --> 00:39:19.648
density.
So, it hit--so,

00:39:19.648 --> 00:39:21.949
it was beyond the critical
density.

00:39:21.949 --> 00:39:25.674
And so, that little piece of
the Universe stopped and turned

00:39:25.674 --> 00:39:29.840
around, even though the Universe
as a whole continues to expand.

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:34.540
All right, so, now.
What do we have?

00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:40.320
Let's go back to the plot.
There's 1.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.225
Here's 1.
And so, we have the supernovae

00:39:44.225 --> 00:39:47.599
forcing you to be in this box,
here.

00:39:47.599 --> 00:39:52.436
We have the Cosmic Microwave
Background forcing you to be in

00:39:52.436 --> 00:39:56.176
this box, here.
And now, we're going to have a

00:39:56.176 --> 00:40:00.868
straight vertical line in this
plot, because we know how much

00:40:00.868 --> 00:40:05.170
dark matter there is from the
structure simulations.

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.840
Now, there are two
possibilities.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:13.955
Supposing it comes in
here–this is a good answer,

00:40:13.955 --> 00:40:19.789
because then,
everything is consistent.

00:40:19.789 --> 00:40:23.800
Alternatively,
however, it could come in here.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.266
This would be awkward,
because if it came in there,

00:40:28.266 --> 00:40:33.716
there would be no answer that
would simultaneously satisfy all

00:40:33.716 --> 00:40:37.062
of these constraints.
And so, then,

00:40:37.062 --> 00:40:42.197
something is wrong either with
one of these determinations of

00:40:42.197 --> 00:40:46.989
the cosmic parameters,
or with the theory as a whole.

00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:52.989
Could be either observational
badness or theoretical badness.

00:40:52.989 --> 00:40:57.856
And remember one – you know,
we did assume – in even

00:40:57.856 --> 00:41:01.749
making this plot,
you're assuming that you're

00:41:01.749 --> 00:41:06.969
dealing with a Cosmological
Constant as the form of the dark

00:41:06.969 --> 00:41:09.816
energy.
And, as we discussed last time,

00:41:09.816 --> 00:41:12.882
it's possible that it isn't
constant, that it's something

00:41:12.882 --> 00:41:14.704
else.
And so, if you ended up--if

00:41:14.704 --> 00:41:17.369
these things didn't work,
you'd have to ask yourself,

00:41:17.369 --> 00:41:19.829
do I have any clue how the dark
energy works?

00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:22.233
And the answer would be,
no, and you would kind of have

00:41:22.233 --> 00:41:23.969
to abandon the Cosmological
Constant.

00:41:23.969 --> 00:41:27.710
I think that's the easiest way
out if things don't work,

00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:30.703
because dark matte--we don't
know what it is,

00:41:30.703 --> 00:41:34.401
but we do know what it does.
It exerts gravity and pulls

00:41:34.401 --> 00:41:37.321
things together.
So, no matter what the answer

00:41:37.321 --> 00:41:40.228
to what it is,
its gravity will still be the

00:41:40.228 --> 00:41:42.469
same.
Dark energy--not only do we not

00:41:42.469 --> 00:41:44.881
know what it is,
we don't really know what it

00:41:44.881 --> 00:41:46.427
does,
except that at the moment,

00:41:46.427 --> 00:41:48.429
it's causing a certain amount
of acceleration.

00:41:48.429 --> 00:41:51.892
And so, if you were satisfied
that all the observations were

00:41:51.892 --> 00:41:55.531
right, you might also think that
your simulations have left out

00:41:55.531 --> 00:41:59.230
something important.
That could easily be that you

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:03.178
don't fully understand how
structure evolves from a

00:42:03.178 --> 00:42:07.271
Z of 3,000 to now.
That's certainly true at some

00:42:07.271 --> 00:42:09.867
level, and so,
there are various ways you

00:42:09.867 --> 00:42:16.299
could get out of it.
But the nice thing about it is

00:42:16.299 --> 00:42:23.604
it's a test of cosmology.
Basically, if you have one

00:42:23.604 --> 00:42:30.466
measurement of two variables,
the variables being the amount

00:42:30.466 --> 00:42:36.050
of dark energy and the amount of
dark matter,

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.092
that doesn't tell you--all that
does is it establishes a

00:42:39.092 --> 00:42:41.360
relationship between the two
variables.

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.650
It doesn't actually measure
either one of them.

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:46.551
And so, you get some allowed
region like this or this,

00:42:46.551 --> 00:42:48.960
but you don't actually make a
measurement.

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.962
If you have two measurements of
two variable--if you think of it

00:42:54.962 --> 00:43:00.011
in a mathematical sense,
this is two equations and two

00:43:00.011 --> 00:43:02.539
unknowns.
This you can solve.

00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:08.348
So, then, you measure values
for--well, in this case,

00:43:08.348 --> 00:43:13.040
Ω_λ and
Ω_matter.

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.181
And that's nice.
Then, you can,

00:43:15.181 --> 00:43:17.799
you know, quote what the values
are, once you've done this,

00:43:17.799 --> 00:43:20.192
to however--whatever the
precision of your measurement

00:43:20.192 --> 00:43:24.995
turns out to be.
If you have three measurements

00:43:24.995 --> 00:43:30.779
of two variables,
that's a test of the theory,

00:43:30.779 --> 00:43:37.977
because it is not guaranteed
that you'll get a consistent

00:43:37.977 --> 00:43:41.276
result.
In general, if you write down

00:43:41.276 --> 00:43:44.850
three lines in a two-dimensional
space, you don't pick out a

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.699
single point,
because they don't all cross at

00:43:47.699 --> 00:43:49.942
the same place.
And so, if they do,

00:43:49.942 --> 00:43:52.420
then you've got a consistent
result.

00:43:52.420 --> 00:43:55.241
And then, you have tested the
theory because your prediction

00:43:55.241 --> 00:43:57.920
is that all these three lines
cross at the same place.

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.886
They don't have to do that.
So, if you measure something

00:44:00.886 --> 00:44:03.569
and it works out that way,
then you've tested the theory

00:44:03.569 --> 00:44:05.179
and, kind of,
come out on top.

00:44:05.179 --> 00:44:13.789
So, let me end today's class by
showing you the answer.

00:44:13.789 --> 00:44:18.360
This is what we know about the
Universe.

00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:25.969
Let's see, what have I done
with my--oh, there it is.

00:44:25.969 --> 00:44:29.280
This is the allowed region of
the supernovae.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:33.266
And what they've done is,
in each of the cases,

00:44:33.266 --> 00:44:37.860
there's a sort of--I think it's
a one sigma region.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:41.226
So, there's a 2/3 chance it'll
live inside here,

00:44:41.226 --> 00:44:44.234
and a--;well,
over 90% chance that it lives

00:44:44.234 --> 00:44:48.611
inside the broader area.
So, the supernovae force you to

00:44:48.611 --> 00:44:51.458
be here.
The Cosmic Microwave Background

00:44:51.458 --> 00:44:54.940
is the green result and it
forces you to be here.

00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.835
And then, the clusters,
Large-Scale Clustering,

00:44:57.835 --> 00:45:00.290
force you to be here,
and they cross.

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:04.207
So, this is the big triumph.
You've tested the theory by

00:45:04.207 --> 00:45:08.704
measuring it in three different
ways for two parameters--namely,

00:45:08.704 --> 00:45:12.630
the dark energy density and the
dark matter density.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:16.234
Now, there are a couple other
interesting things to note on

00:45:16.234 --> 00:45:17.747
this plot.
One is that,

00:45:17.747 --> 00:45:20.498
in some cases,
the Universe expands forever,

00:45:20.498 --> 00:45:22.929
and in some cases,
it re-collapses.

00:45:22.929 --> 00:45:25.369
And we're well into the
expansion region.

00:45:25.369 --> 00:45:31.530
There's also the question of
the geometry of the Universe.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:34.509
The more stuff there is,
either dark energy or dark

00:45:34.509 --> 00:45:37.309
matter, the more curved the
Universe becomes.

00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:40.314
And so, you can ask yourself,
is the Universe curved in such

00:45:40.314 --> 00:45:42.250
a way that it curves back on
itself?

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:45.195
Is it basically flat,
giving you Euclidian geometry,

00:45:45.195 --> 00:45:48.139
or does it curve backwards and
extend infinitely?

00:45:48.139 --> 00:45:51.019
And that's these three
situations, here.

00:45:51.019 --> 00:45:54.832
If the sum is equal to 1,
then the Universe is flat and

00:45:54.832 --> 00:45:58.199
Euclidian.
And so, that separates these

00:45:58.199 --> 00:46:00.915
two.
Now, as somebody pointed out a

00:46:00.915 --> 00:46:04.012
few classes ago,
if you have too much dark

00:46:04.012 --> 00:46:08.173
energy, then you never cross 0.
And you never have a Big Bang,

00:46:08.173 --> 00:46:11.359
because the acceleration has
been so great that you must have

00:46:11.359 --> 00:46:14.970
started out coming down and been
bent up toward where we are now.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:18.170
That's this region up here.
No Big Bang.

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:21.199
And so, we're well away from
that as well.

00:46:21.199 --> 00:46:27.365
And so, this basically sums up
what we currently know about the

00:46:27.365 --> 00:46:31.411
expansion of the Universe.
That we have a constraint going

00:46:31.411 --> 00:46:33.691
this way, a constraint going
this way, a constraint going

00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:36.095
this way.
And you can see why I say that

00:46:36.095 --> 00:46:39.353
in a kind of philosophical
sense, all three of these

00:46:39.353 --> 00:46:41.780
measurements are equally
important,

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:45.539
because it's the fact that
you've got three of them that

00:46:45.539 --> 00:46:49.047
allows a test of the theory.
And we've talked a lot about

00:46:49.047 --> 00:46:51.196
the supernovae.
You could talk just as much

00:46:51.196 --> 00:46:53.977
about the Cosmic Microwave
Background or about Large-Scale

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.811
Clustering,
and the comparison of

00:46:55.811 --> 00:46:57.730
simulations with redshift
surveys.

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:01.033
We obviously aren't going to
have time to do it,

00:47:01.033 --> 00:47:05.180
but this plot summarizes what
we know about the Universe.

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.180
Okay, thanks.

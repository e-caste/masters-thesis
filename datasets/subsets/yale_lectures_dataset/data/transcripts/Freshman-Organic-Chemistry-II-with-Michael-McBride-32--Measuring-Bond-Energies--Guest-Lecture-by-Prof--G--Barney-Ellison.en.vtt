00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.500
G. BARNEY ELLISON: I'd like
to see if I can 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.400
describe to you how you could 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.867
measure the bond energies of
complex molecules. 

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:12.833
And to start out, let me just
remind you what 

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:13.767
we're talking about. 

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:15.400
Let me talk about something like
methane. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.367
I'm going to need a larger
stick. 

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:22.067
So if you have methane, and you
want to measure the bond 

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:26.500
energy, I literally want to
reach in and measure the 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.867
energy it would take to grab
that hydrogen and literally 

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:31.233
just rip it out of there. 

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:33.600
And when you can see it does
that, the molecule is going to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.333
have a change from a tetrahedral

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.067
geometry to a flat geometry. 

00:00:38.067 --> 00:00:40.867
And there's a potential curve
that I've written as a Morse 

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:41.833
oscillator. 

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.300
And there's a zero point energy,
and you're going to 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.733
have to measure the energy to go
from the ground states up 

00:00:47.733 --> 00:00:52.167
to the dissociation limit. 

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:57.933
So I thought I'd try to tell
you, just in a simple way. 

00:00:57.933 --> 00:01:01.100
If you took a molecule, and
you'd like to try to see if 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.267
you could measure the different
bonds in the molecule, 

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:08.833
how could the specific bond
energies be measured? 

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:12.067
And let me consider something
like methanol. 

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:14.567
I'd like to take methanol, and
I'd like to show you how you 

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:19.167
measure the bond energy to break
the OH bond, then how 

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:24.267
you'd break the CH bond or how
you'd break the CO bond. 

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:25.700
And I don't want to calculate
this. 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.233
I actually want to measure it. 

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:36.867
So one way you can do this is to
use a gas-phase-acidity- 

00:01:36.867 --> 00:01:39.633
electronegativity cycle. 

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:46.233
This is a negative-ion cycle
that you'll take this 

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:50.067
molecule, say, methanol, and if
you treat this with a base 

00:01:50.067 --> 00:01:53.633
such as its fluoride ion, the
fluoride ion is actually going 

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:54.467
to attack the methanol. 

00:01:54.467 --> 00:01:58.533
And when it does this, it's
going to pull a proton off. 

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.700
And if it does that, you'll form
a methoxide ion. 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.067
The fluoride ion will never pull
the proton off the 

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.967
carbon, because the negative ion
that you get has the 

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:15.867
electron sitting on the carbon,
and the oxygen is more 

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:20.133
electronegative, so you'll
always get the top ion. 

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:26.333
So if you could do that, what
you'd like to think about is, 

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:29.000
how can I measure an equilibrium

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.233
between these two species? 

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:34.833
And if I have the equilibrium, I
can get the enthalpy, and if 

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:39.133
I can get the enthalpy, I can
get the acidity of this. 

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:45.900
So this is an experiment that a
bunch of us do in Boulder. 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.633
The world's expert in these gas
phase acidity measurements 

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:55.400
is my colleague Ronnie Bierbaum,
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE Doctor 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.833
Veronica Marie Bierbaum. 

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.467
And she's very good at this. 

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:06.433
They have a flow tube, and this
is the experiment you 

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:07.333
want to do. 

00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:12.300
So you would like to measure the
reaction of fluoride ion 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.033
pulling a proton off methanol to
get the methoxide ion. 

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:20.467
So what you do is...here you
can't get a lecture bottle of 

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:23.900
fluoride ion, because they're
charged. 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.800
So what you've got to do is take
a gas, 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.233
and you make a plasma. 

00:03:29.233 --> 00:03:31.200
You boil electrons off a
filament. 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.700
And as the electrons interact
with the HF, the electrons 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.600
get captured into a sigma*
orbital, and the molecule 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.733
detonates and gives you an F
minus and hydrogen atoms. 

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:48.467
So the fluoride ions are
injected into this flow tube. 

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:49.667
And there's methanol in here. 

00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:53.967
And what happens is, as the
reaction proceeds, the 

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.733
methanol has a proton removed
from it. 

00:03:56.733 --> 00:04:00.267
And you're literally watching
the end of the flow tube with 

00:04:00.267 --> 00:04:01.867
a quadrupole mass spec. 

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.667
The quadrupole mass spec
monitors the negative ions 

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:08.400
that have m/Z 31, and you'll
watch them growing in. 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.400
So as you watch the methoxide
ion going in, you can measure 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.733
the rate constant K1, that goes
this way. 

00:04:15.733 --> 00:04:19.467
So if you do that, what you're
after is 

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:20.933
the equilibrium constant. 

00:04:20.933 --> 00:04:24.933
So to get the equilibrium
constant, one way to do this 

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:28.667
is that you would measure the
reverse rate. 

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:34.967
So if you did that, to measure
such a reaction, now you'd 

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:38.233
just turn the reaction...you do
the reverse of this. 

00:04:38.233 --> 00:04:43.567
You now have to make a vapor of
methoxide anions. 

00:04:43.567 --> 00:04:46.467
An easy way to do this is to
have electrons interact with 

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:47.800
methyl nitrite. 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.833
The methyl nitrite then
disintegrates, and it forms 

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:53.833
methoxide anion and nitric
oxide, NO 

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:56.633
And the methoxide ion then goes
down the flow tube. 

00:04:56.633 --> 00:05:00.300
And if the methoxide ion
interacts with the HF, now 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.867
what you'll see is F minus
growing in. 

00:05:02.867 --> 00:05:05.333
And you know it's F minus,
because Jesus only made a 

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.900
finite number of ions that have
m/Z 19, 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.833
and fluoride is it. 

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:10.133
There's no other. 

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:12.233
So it turns out when you do
that, you're 

00:05:12.233 --> 00:05:14.533
able to monitor this. 

00:05:14.533 --> 00:05:20.600
So if you've measured K1 and
you've measured K minus 1, 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.767
that is going to give you the
equilibrium constant. 

00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:26.867
And this is the difference in
acidity between 

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:28.633
methanol and HF. 

00:05:28.633 --> 00:05:31.733
But the acidity of HF is
well-known. 

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:38.533
It's 370.424 kcal per mole with
this uncertainty. 

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:44.167
And so it turns out that these
two numbers give you the 

00:05:44.167 --> 00:05:49.200
equilibrium constant, and this
is going to give you the gas 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.867
phase acidity. 

00:05:49.867 --> 00:05:54.467
So by making the equilibrium
constant, Professor Bierbaum 

00:05:54.467 --> 00:05:56.867
has measured the acidity of this
species. 

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:04.633
The way to think about this now,
to use acidity, here's 

00:06:04.633 --> 00:06:06.600
what the gas-phase acidity is. 

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.367
Remember, she really has this
number in the gas phase. 

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:12.667
You know, in the gas phase,
these molecules are never 

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:17.200
going to dissociate into ions,
because you've got to

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.633
deal with Coulomb's law. 

00:06:18.633 --> 00:06:22.300
So you're talking about maybe
300, 400 kcal per mole. 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.500
So it's a whopping amount of
energy. 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.167
So the way to think about this
is, to get that ion, you have

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.300
to break the OH bond. 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.267
Then you have to somehow measure
the electron affinity. 

00:06:37.267 --> 00:06:41.333
That gives you the energy of the
negative ion here. 

00:06:41.333 --> 00:06:46.467
And the ionization energy of a
hydrogen atom is how you 

00:06:46.467 --> 00:06:47.733
get the proton. 

00:06:47.733 --> 00:06:51.933
And here, this is the easiest
way I think about this. 

00:06:51.933 --> 00:06:53.533
This acidity-- 

00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:55.167
you want to get those ions. 

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:57.033
The first thing you've got to do
is reach in with a pair of 

00:06:57.033 --> 00:07:00.667
scissors and cut this bond. 

00:07:00.667 --> 00:07:02.367
So you've got to pay that
energy. 

00:07:02.367 --> 00:07:04.100
You've also got to give me the
ionization 

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.500
energy of hydrogen atom. 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.867
You've got to pay me that,
because that 

00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:09.933
gives you the proton. 

00:07:09.933 --> 00:07:15.833
And then you take the electron
and put it back on the alkoxy 

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:17.933
radical, and that's the electron
affinity. 

00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:19.200
So it turns out-- 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.167
Here, 

00:07:23.167 --> 00:07:24.100
this is what we're after. 

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.300
We want this bond energy. 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.767
And this will be the energy for
that bond only. 

00:07:28.767 --> 00:07:33.667
And so the electron affinity for
hydrogen atom is known to 

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:35.233
some pornographic detail. 

00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:37.800
You couldn't imagine what's been
done to this poor atom. 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.400
This is done to like 80 digits.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.600
So turns out the only thing
you've got to do is now, you 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.533
now have to measure the electron

00:07:45.533 --> 00:07:47.800
affinity of the radical. 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.400
So how are you going to do that?

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.433
So this is an experiment that's
done actually here by 

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:03.033
Professor Mark Johnson at Yale
University, and it's done a 

00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:05.800
bit by people in Boulder,
Colorado. 

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.733
Here's what you do. 

00:08:06.733 --> 00:08:10.033
You literally take a vapor of
these negative ions. 

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:12.567
And if you take a vapor of the
negative ions, 

00:08:12.567 --> 00:08:14.467
you make a fast beam. 

00:08:14.467 --> 00:08:16.767
You cross this with a laser. 

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:19.867
I know the energy of the laser
precisely. 

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:23.100
So what you do is, when the
laser interacts with the 

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:27.000
negative ions, you'll eject
electrons, and you catch them 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.767
in a hemispherical analyzer. 

00:08:28.767 --> 00:08:30.900
You literally measure the
kinetic energy. 

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.800
So this is the kinetic energy. 

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:33.433
So here. 

00:08:33.433 --> 00:08:35.300
This is easy. 

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.900
If you know what the energy
going in is, and you know what 

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.267
the energy coming out is, you've
measured those two 

00:08:40.267 --> 00:08:42.900
things, and the difference is
the binding energy. 

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:46.933
So here's the negative ion. 

00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:51.467
When the electromagnetic wave
comes blazing in and strikes 

00:08:51.467 --> 00:08:54.733
it, what happens is, here's the
laser energy. 

00:08:54.733 --> 00:08:58.933
So the molecule literally
interacts with the laser, and 

00:08:58.933 --> 00:09:02.767
an electron's knocked off, and
what you're going to do, is 

00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:04.067
you're going to measure the red
arrow. 

00:09:04.067 --> 00:09:07.133
This is the kinetic energy of
the photoelectron. 

00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:10.400
So if you measure what comes
out, then the difference is 

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.733
the binding energy. 

00:09:11.733 --> 00:09:17.700
So it turns out that this is the
essential experiment you 

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.767
have to do. 

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:21.067
There's a bunch of details
you've got to 

00:09:21.067 --> 00:09:22.200
pay attention to. 

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.433
If the product radical is
vibrating, then the 

00:09:26.433 --> 00:09:29.133
photoelectron kinetic energy
will be smaller than the 

00:09:29.133 --> 00:09:31.700
measured binding energy. 

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.600
And these are just a 
bunch of words. 

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.633
Let me just show 
you what you do.

00:09:35.733 --> 00:09:36.867
This is it.

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:42.367
Jesus, we did this like thirty
years ago. 

00:09:42.367 --> 00:09:45.433
Christ, I'm an old guy. 

00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:47.567
When you do this, what you do is
you take a-- 

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.767
right here. 

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:54.667
So what you're going to do is,
you're going to measure the 

00:09:54.667 --> 00:09:56.433
kinetic energy of the electrons
coming out. 

00:09:56.433 --> 00:09:57.733
So we're making a plot of the 

00:09:57.733 --> 00:09:59.733
photoelectron kinetic energy. 

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:04.467
Here, let me just show, the
laser is 488. 

00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:06.400
It's a beautiful robin's egg
blue. 

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.833
Extremely bright laser. 

00:10:08.833 --> 00:10:13.033
And 488 nanometers is 2.540
electron volts. 

00:10:13.033 --> 00:10:13.500
So here. 

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.433
Think about this. 

00:10:14.433 --> 00:10:16.467
This is the photoelectron
kinetic energy with electrons 

00:10:16.467 --> 00:10:17.167
coming out. 

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:22.167
No electrons can come out with
more than 2.54 eV, because 

00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:24.433
that's all I've got to put in. 

00:10:24.433 --> 00:10:27.500
So the first time you see
electronic, counts-- 

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.767
this is electron counts-- 

00:10:28.767 --> 00:10:33.500
is at about 1 eV. When you
actually measure it, it's 

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:39.367
measured to be 0.968 eV. And so
the way you get the 

00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:43.500
electron affinity, is if you put
2.54 eV in, and you 

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:50.333
measure 0.968 coming out, then
the difference is 1.572, plus 

00:10:50.333 --> 00:10:51.867
or minus 4 milli electron volts.

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:54.733
And that's how you do it. 

00:10:54.733 --> 00:10:57.800
This is detachment to the ground
state 

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.833
of the methoxy dot. 

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:02.567
This is one vibration in the
methoxy dot. 

00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:05.300
This is two vibrations, this is
three vibrations. 

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.933
Can you see how cool this is? 

00:11:06.933 --> 00:11:09.100
You can actually take a
vibrational spectrum. 

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.867
You're looking at the vibrations
in a radical. 

00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:13.133
Well, that's not hard-- 

00:11:13.133 --> 00:11:14.033
that's not easy to do. 

00:11:14.033 --> 00:11:15.800
Because you don't have a lecture
bottle of radicals. 

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.100
So this is a very powerful
experiment on the one day of 

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.967
the month when it works. 

00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:22.500
I'll not kid you. 

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.333
These experiments of
Professor Bierbaum's,

00:11:25.333 --> 00:11:25.900
you spend most of 

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:29.167
your time with the hardware,
trying to make sure the 

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:30.867
electronics are stable and what
not. 

00:11:30.867 --> 00:11:33.800
And then when you're running,
these people basically are 

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.967
dancing around the machine nude
with tambourines, just 

00:11:36.967 --> 00:11:39.000
trying to keep the machine
stable long 

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.300
enough to get a spectrum. 

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.233
But when it works, you're going
to get 

00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:44.433
a number very clean. 

00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:46.300
And you see how precise this is?

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.967
I mean, this is a very nice
measurement. 

00:11:49.967 --> 00:11:54.533
So we can now do what we're
going to do. 

00:11:54.533 --> 00:11:59.367
If Bierbaum has the acidity, and
you know the electron 

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:02.833
affinity, and you know the
ionization energy of hydrogen 

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:06.700
atom, so here are these numbers.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.600
When you put these things in,
you get out that the bond 

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.367
energy is about a 105 kcal per
mole. 

00:12:12.367 --> 00:12:15.167
And this is the bond energy of
methanol in the innergalactic 

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:18.367
space with nobody else around. 

00:12:18.367 --> 00:12:21.267
And all of these people who like
to think they can 

00:12:21.267 --> 00:12:23.700
calculate everything by using
all these quantum mechanical 

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.867
programs, now this is the number
they have to get. 

00:12:26.867 --> 00:12:28.400
There is no place to hide. 

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.167
This is the cleanly measured
value. 

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.133
No experimental system is
perfect. 

00:12:38.133 --> 00:12:43.300
So for example, problems you can
have. I just showed you 

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.167
how to measure the OH bond. 

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:47.567
Suppose you want to measure the
CH bond. 

00:12:47.567 --> 00:12:50.833
Well, this will never work! 

00:12:50.833 --> 00:12:53.633
Because the negative cycle will
never work. 

00:12:53.633 --> 00:12:54.167
Why? 

00:12:54.167 --> 00:12:58.533
Because when you take any base
that you apply to this, the 

00:12:58.533 --> 00:13:01.000
base is always going to take off
the most acidic proton. 

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.767
Well, the most acidic proton is
one off the OH, because you 

00:13:03.767 --> 00:13:07.667
get the negative on with the
electron on the oxygen. 

00:13:07.667 --> 00:13:09.433
That's good. 

00:13:09.433 --> 00:13:12.867
If you have a base that you try
to pull a proton off the 

00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:17.033
carbon, the electron is going to
be on the carbon atom, and 

00:13:17.033 --> 00:13:18.533
that's bad. 

00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.200
Oxygen's more electronegative. 

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.500
It'll hold it much tighter. 

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:27.967
So turns out the negative ions
are not going to be a useful 

00:13:27.967 --> 00:13:29.867
way to do this. 

00:13:29.867 --> 00:13:31.567
And of course, if you were going
to apply the negative-ion 

00:13:31.567 --> 00:13:35.533
cycle, then you'd have to
measure the acidity of this 

00:13:35.533 --> 00:13:38.167
proton, then we'd have to
measure the electron affinity 

00:13:38.167 --> 00:13:39.333
of this radical. 

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:40.833
Does everybody see that this
radical-- 

00:13:40.833 --> 00:13:42.733
this is hydroxy methyl radical--

00:13:42.733 --> 00:13:44.300
is different than methoxy? 

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.567
Because the dot sits on the
carbon, not on the oxygen, so 

00:13:47.567 --> 00:13:48.900
it's a different radical. 

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.067
So if you can't make the ion,
then we can't do our 

00:13:51.067 --> 00:13:53.300
measurements, and we're dead. 

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.333
Not to worry. 

00:13:55.333 --> 00:13:58.900
There's other techniques you can
do. 

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:06.067
My friend David Gutman does
radical kinetics. 

00:14:06.067 --> 00:14:09.700
And so a thing you can do is you
can make chlorine atoms. 

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:15.033
And when you make chlorine atoms
in a flow tube, he uses 

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:18.133
photoionization mass spec to
monitor the products. 

00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:21.767
And so he can measure K1, and he
can measure K minus 1. 

00:14:21.767 --> 00:14:22.600
So he gets to equal-- 

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.600
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Can you
explain what a flow tube is? 

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:30.333
PROFESSOR ELLISON: A flow tube
is a beautiful device that's a 

00:14:30.333 --> 00:14:32.033
meter long. 

00:14:32.033 --> 00:14:36.167
It's my fist, ten centimeters in
diameter. 

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:40.333
And Bierbaum has flowing through
this a tremendous flow 

00:14:40.333 --> 00:14:42.000
of helium gas. 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.067
And so when you make ions, the
ions are made up here in the 

00:14:46.067 --> 00:14:47.000
discharge, and then-- 

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.700
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Wha's the
pressure in there? 

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.033
PROFESSOR ELLISON: The pressure
will be about a torr. 

00:14:51.033 --> 00:14:55.833
And so it turns out that it's
mostly helium, and you have a 

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:58.667
few millitorr of the reagents
that you've got. 

00:14:58.667 --> 00:15:00.533
You have a quadrupole mass spec.

00:15:00.533 --> 00:15:03.833
The quadrupole mass spec, of
course, can't operate in a 

00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:10.867
millitorr, so there's some
clever pumping that you have 

00:15:10.867 --> 00:15:13.767
to sample the output of the flow
tube. 

00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:16.367
So the quadrupole mass spec only
looks at the ions. 

00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:19.900
So if you have a reaction that
occurs in here, one ion would 

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.267
go away, and another one would
come up. 

00:15:22.267 --> 00:15:25.600
And you can monitor this with a
quadrupole mass spec. 

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:28.033
Remember, the way the ions get
downstream is they're carried 

00:15:28.033 --> 00:15:29.600
along by the helium. 

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.067
And what's true in a flow tube
is, the distance equals the 

00:15:33.067 --> 00:15:34.333
rate times the time. 

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.567
So if you have a shorter
distance, you have a shorter 

00:15:36.567 --> 00:15:37.333
reaction time. 

00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:38.800
If you have a longer distance,
you have a 

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:39.867
longer reaction time. 

00:15:39.867 --> 00:15:41.800
And if you measure that
variation, you 

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:42.533
can get a rate constant. 

00:15:42.533 --> 00:15:45.633
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: How do you
change the distance? 

00:15:45.633 --> 00:15:47.900
PROFESSOR ELLISON: It turns out
that you can change the 

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.667
distance by admitting your
reagent through 

00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:53.833
a tiny little tube. 

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:56.400
And this tube is the cutest
little thing you 

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.700
ever saw in your life. 

00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.167
It slides on a little wire. 

00:16:00.167 --> 00:16:07.333
And they literally, like a
gorilla, they'll set the 

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:13.833
ejection tube at a certain
space, and then what they'll 

00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:16.900
do, is they'll systematically
vary this by simply 

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:17.900
pulling this back. 

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.533
Then they'll measure the ratios
of these rates. 

00:16:20.533 --> 00:16:23.133
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: We talked
earlier about Robert Hooke

00:16:23.133 --> 00:16:26.433
making a vacuum pump 
to lower pressure. 

00:16:26.433 --> 00:16:28.300
So is that the kind, do you have
somebody down, 

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.800
in the basement pumping on this
or how do you get the vacuum? 

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.367
PROFESSOR ELLISON: No, it turns
out-- 

00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:31.933
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: That's a lot

00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:32.800
of helium you're 
putting through.

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.333
PROFESSOR ELLISON: Sure. 

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:33.700
OK. 

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:39.567
So Professor Bierbaum
uses a set of pumps which 

00:16:39.567 --> 00:16:41.700
are as big as I am. 

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.967
They're roots blowers. 

00:16:43.967 --> 00:16:48.633
These pumps will pump just a
staggering quantity of gas, 

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:53.567
like 500 liters a second, at
this pressure. 

00:16:53.567 --> 00:16:55.567
These pumps-- 

00:16:55.567 --> 00:16:57.867
I'm just telling you words-- 

00:16:57.867 --> 00:17:00.733
one of the uses of these pumps
are to pump grain in grain 

00:17:00.733 --> 00:17:02.000
elevators in Kansas. 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.333
Have you ever been to some
dreadful place like Kansas? 

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:08.700
I mean, there's 10,000 of these
silos. 

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.000
And so the grain is pumped
around in these, with these 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.833
huge pumps. 

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:17.033
So she has two of these in the
basement. 

00:17:17.033 --> 00:17:21.633
So it's a very hard experiment
to do. 

00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:24.067
So you can also do radicals in
this. 

00:17:24.067 --> 00:17:27.667
And let me just tell you
Gutman's experiment. 

00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:29.567
He's going to measure Kequi 

00:17:29.567 --> 00:17:31.900
and so he's going to measure the
reaction, from the 

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.400
equilibrium constant. From the
temperature variation of the 

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:40.133
equilibrium constant, he's going
to get the reaction 

00:17:40.133 --> 00:17:40.833
energy of this. 

00:17:40.833 --> 00:17:43.700
And the reaction energy of this
radical reaction is, 

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.433
you're going to have to pay the
bond energy, this CH bond 

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:48.067
energy, and you're going to get
the bond 

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:50.367
energy of HCI back. 

00:17:50.367 --> 00:17:51.633
I now have to tell you
something. 

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:55.967
The bond energy of HCl is known
to be 103 kcal per mole. 

00:17:55.967 --> 00:17:59.300
Remember, I told you the bond
energy for methanol is 104. 

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:04.567
So the chloride atoms, if they
hit the hydrogen on the OH 

00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:07.000
group, if they hit it, they'll
just bounce off, because they 

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.800
don't have enough energy to do
this. 

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:13.267
So they're only going to pull
the hydrogens 

00:18:13.267 --> 00:18:14.967
off the methyl group. 

00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:18.800
So when you do that, if you do
the analysis, you can get that 

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:24.967
the CH bond on methanol is 96
kcal per mole. 

00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:27.267
And on the days when it works,
you can 

00:18:27.267 --> 00:18:29.000
get this very precisely. 

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.400
So those are two of the bond
energies that you 

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.800
can get from methanol. 

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.133
So you might wonder, what's the
CO bond in methanol? 

00:18:39.133 --> 00:18:41.433
In other words, you're literally
going to take the 

00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:45.600
methanol molecule, and you'll
karate-chop it in the center, 

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.300
and you just want to cut it in
two. 

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.700
So that means I've got to
measure the energy of the 

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.400
methyl radicals and the hydroxyl
radicals. 

00:18:55.400 --> 00:19:00.833
So it turns out, this is a
straightforward thing to do. 

00:19:00.833 --> 00:19:05.033
Turns out that if you want to
look at this, this bond 

00:19:05.033 --> 00:19:10.267
energy, to get that heat of
formation...Here, I need to get

00:19:10.267 --> 00:19:11.000
methyl radicals. 

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.867
So to get methyl radicals, you
actually have to measure the 

00:19:13.867 --> 00:19:14.933
bond energy of methane. 

00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:18.133
Because that's the bond energy
of methane is the heat of 

00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:20.500
formation of methyl radicals,
heat of formation of hydrogen, 

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.233
minus that of methane. 

00:19:22.233 --> 00:19:26.900
So photoionization mass spec or
reaction kinetics both 

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.700
measure the bond energy of
methane to be 

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.000
104.99 kcal per mole. 

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.667
The bond energy of hydrogen, H
atom, comes from the 

00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:37.200
dissociation energy of H2. 

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.467
So there's classical tables. 

00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:43.333
These guys, Mr. Pedley and his
friends, there's 3,000 of 

00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:45.300
these bond energies that these
guys anally 

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.967
have put in this book. 

00:19:48.967 --> 00:19:53.833
So it turns out that if you have
these guys, you now use 

00:19:53.833 --> 00:19:56.600
the heat of formation of methyl
radical. 

00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:00.500
I also need to tell you that the
bond energy of water gives 

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.033
you the heat of formation of
methyl 

00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:04.467
radical-- of hydroxyl radical. 

00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:07.500
So turns out if I know hydroxyl
radical, and I know 

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:10.300
methyl radical, then Pedley et
al will give you the heat of 

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.167
formation of methanol. 

00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:14.700
So this is the other thing I'm
going to need. 

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.667
So turns out that this bond
energy is equal to heat of 

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:22.067
formation of methyl radical,
plus OH radical, 

00:20:22.067 --> 00:20:23.933
minus that of methanol. 

00:20:23.933 --> 00:20:26.867
And so this comes from water,
that comes from bond energy of 

00:20:26.867 --> 00:20:29.233
methane, dissociation of
methane. 

00:20:29.233 --> 00:20:31.333
And this is Mr. Pedley. 

00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:34.333
So that's actually the weakest
bond in the molecule. 

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.967
The weakest bond in the molecule
is the CO bond. 

00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:44.233
So you can actually work all of
three of these bonds out by 

00:20:44.233 --> 00:20:45.900
going through a procedure. 

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:49.000
Me and a whole bunch of other
really smart people have 

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
measured a large number of these
molecules, and these are 

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.433
the bond energies. 

00:20:55.433 --> 00:21:01.733
There's all sorts of complicated
heats of formation 

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:03.967
that you can use. 

00:21:03.967 --> 00:21:08.333
Let me just talk here at the
end, for the last part of 

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:11.567
this, about trying to compare
these things. 

00:21:14.133 --> 00:21:17.300
Professor McBride is typically
going on like a broken record. 

00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.633
We always try to say, how do you
know what you've done? 

00:21:22.367 --> 00:21:24.067
Which means to say-- 

00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:24.467
Here. 

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:25.167
I'm not kidding you. 

00:21:25.167 --> 00:21:26.600
It's very easy to make a
mistake. 

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.700
If you get any of these
calibrations wrong, or any of 

00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:32.600
these little cycles are done in
an incorrect manner, it's 

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:37.333
very easy for you to have an
uncertainty. 

00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:39.033
Indeed, let me go back. 

00:21:39.033 --> 00:21:43.867
I need to make one point I
wasn't smart enough to do 

00:21:43.867 --> 00:21:45.567
where I had this acidity. 

00:21:45.567 --> 00:21:46.833
Here. 

00:21:50.833 --> 00:21:53.100
This bond energy that we're
going to measure-- 

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.333
OK, we're going to get this
through a cycle. 

00:21:55.333 --> 00:21:59.167
And to do this cycle, we have to
do two difficult 

00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:00.500
experiments. 

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500
Bierbaum has to measure the
acidity. 

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.767
It's a very large number. 

00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:06.133
That's 380 kcal per mole. 

00:22:06.133 --> 00:22:09.067
And the electron affinity is
known. 

00:22:09.067 --> 00:22:11.000
The ionization energy of
hydrogen atoms is known. 

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.200
But you have to measure the
electron 

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.267
affinity for this radical. 

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:19.400
So this number comes from a
cycle where you're adding and 

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.433
subtracting large numbers. 

00:22:21.433 --> 00:22:23.067
And you're smart guys. 

00:22:23.067 --> 00:22:23.733
You know this. 

00:22:23.733 --> 00:22:27.633
If you have a number that you're
after, and there's a 

00:22:27.633 --> 00:22:30.233
cycle that you go through, and
you're taking differences of 

00:22:30.233 --> 00:22:31.567
large numbers 

00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:37.300
any fault, any mistake that's
made here, that error is going 

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.933
to be in this bond energy, or
any error that comes in this 

00:22:39.933 --> 00:22:41.300
measurement. 

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:45.100
There's a famous chemist who's
English, whose name is Colson. 

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:50.033
And Colson used to say,
procedure is like weighing a 

00:22:50.033 --> 00:22:52.500
captain on the ship by weighing
the ship with and 

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.400
without the captain. 

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:54.733
Here. 

00:22:54.733 --> 00:22:55.967
So you have an aircraft carrier.

00:22:55.967 --> 00:22:56.267
OK. 

00:22:56.267 --> 00:22:57.367
You're a smart guy. 

00:22:57.367 --> 00:22:58.400
You get a pair of scales. 

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.467
And you know you have to measure
this aircraft carrier, 

00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:02.967
the weight of this very
precisely. 

00:23:02.967 --> 00:23:05.400
And then you put a little guy on
top, and then the weight's 

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.400
going to change just a titch. 

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.667
And your measurements have to be
so precise you 

00:23:09.667 --> 00:23:10.967
can pick this up. 

00:23:10.967 --> 00:23:15.267
So on the days when it works,
you can really 

00:23:15.267 --> 00:23:16.300
get these bond energies. 

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:20.533
But these are not easy
experiments to do. 

00:23:20.533 --> 00:23:28.433
Let me talk here about these
bond energies. 

00:23:28.433 --> 00:23:30.833
We've done several of these
things. 

00:23:30.833 --> 00:23:38.133
You might guess that if you have
an alcohol-- 

00:23:38.133 --> 00:23:41.333
I did methanol, this is the OH
bond in methanol-- 

00:23:41.333 --> 00:23:43.500
you might hope that the OH bond
in ethanol 

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:44.800
would be the same. 

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.933
And it's exactly the same within
our uncertainty. 

00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:51.733
If you go to-- 

00:23:51.733 --> 00:23:55.567
this is isopropyl alcohol, this
is t-butyl alcohol. 

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:58.767
t-butyl alcohol is a little bit
larger, but you can see, 

00:23:58.767 --> 00:24:04.900
amongst friends, it's all about
104, 105 kcal per mole. 

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:09.967
When you go to measure something
like phenol-- 

00:24:09.967 --> 00:24:12.800
this is an OH bond in phenol,
but this is only 

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.500
like 86 kcal per mole. 

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.133
And you go, Christ, what's wrong
here? 

00:24:17.133 --> 00:24:19.667
Well, this is no regular
alcohol. 

00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:24.100
Here, I drew this. 

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:29.733
If you break the bond in
methanol, you get a hydrogen 

00:24:29.733 --> 00:24:31.300
atom, and you get methoxy dots.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:35.400
And the dot is stuck on the
oxygen atom. 

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:39.567
But if you pull a proton off
phenol, now that 

00:24:39.567 --> 00:24:42.533
dot is not on the oxygen. 

00:24:42.533 --> 00:24:44.367
It's actually delocalized
around. 

00:24:44.367 --> 00:24:46.600
It interacts with the pi system.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.733
And McBride's probably drawn you
some of these resonance 

00:24:51.733 --> 00:24:55.467
forms. Or you can talk about the
interaction of this extra 

00:24:55.467 --> 00:24:58.600
electron with the pi cloud. 

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.667
This is a catastrophic change. 

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:04.800
What this is, like 20 kcal per
mole. 

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:05.700
That's a volt. 

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.667
So it's a lot easier for you to
remove a hydrogen atom from 

00:25:09.667 --> 00:25:12.333
phenol than it is from any
alcohol. 

00:25:16.833 --> 00:25:18.667
We've also done a bunch of
peroxides. 

00:25:23.733 --> 00:25:25.867
Remember, here's hydrogen
peroxide, here's methyl 

00:25:25.867 --> 00:25:29.633
hydroperoxide, here's ethyl
hydroperoxide. 

00:25:29.633 --> 00:25:32.467
These, again, look like OH
bonds. 

00:25:32.467 --> 00:25:33.000
Here. 

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.467
You're also smart people. 

00:25:34.467 --> 00:25:36.100
You know that these peroxides 

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.033
they're very reactive compounds.

00:25:38.033 --> 00:25:40.400
The reason my daughter's a
blonde is because of this. 

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.300
I mean, you can buy a bottle of
this, and only--

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:47.000
Here, let's see

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
There's a difference between
chemistry and, say, other 

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.733
subjects, in that these
molecules are real. 

00:25:54.733 --> 00:25:58.633
When we go to do this... Here.
My daughter would get... 

00:25:58.633 --> 00:26:01.900
You could buy a bottle of
peroxide in the pharmacy. 

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.733
It's 5%. 

00:26:02.733 --> 00:26:06.300
So it's 5% hydrogen peroxide,
and 95% water. 

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:08.767
So we have to make a beam of
these things. 

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:13.100
So there's clever ways that if
you can have these compounds, 

00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:16.600
and you can actually distill
them, then you can make 99% 

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.000
hydrogen peroxide. 

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.300
The hydrogen peroxide, of
course, is extremely reactive. 

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.200
Why is it reactive? 

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.300
It's because the two oxygens are
held together by a single 

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.367
bond, and you have all these
electrons that are crammed 

00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:29.000
right on top of each other. 

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.233
So the bond energy of the O-O
bond is actually quite weak. 

00:26:34.233 --> 00:26:36.800
So it's a very good oxidizer. 

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.467
And so turns out, I've
actually...

00:26:41.467 --> 00:26:43.267
we had a bottle of about 99% 

00:26:43.267 --> 00:26:44.167
percent of this stuff. 

00:26:44.167 --> 00:26:46.433
And I'm talking about this with
my students. 

00:26:46.433 --> 00:26:48.367
And I'm not very skillful. 

00:26:48.367 --> 00:26:51.500
And so it turns they maybe had
about half a 

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:53.033
milliliter of this. 

00:26:53.033 --> 00:26:56.400
As long as hydrogen peroxide is
in glass or 

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.167
plastic, it's fine. 

00:26:58.167 --> 00:26:59.700
Nothing's going to happen. 

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.800
You can handle it safely. 

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.033
But it will oxidize any carbon
that it gets to. 

00:27:07.033 --> 00:27:08.767
So alas, I dropped it. 

00:27:08.767 --> 00:27:12.133
And when I dropped it, it
bounced once on the floor, and 

00:27:12.133 --> 00:27:13.200
then it broke. 

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.267
And when it broke, when the
glass came down and broke, 

00:27:17.267 --> 00:27:19.367
it went, fuff! 

00:27:19.367 --> 00:27:22.267
And there's a big orange spot
around. 

00:27:22.267 --> 00:27:25.667
And what happened was, all the
dirt and stuff on the floor 

00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:26.933
was oxidized immediately! 

00:27:26.933 --> 00:27:28.633
Just gone. 

00:27:28.633 --> 00:27:32.200
So if you have a solution of-- 

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.600
Here, you think I'm kidding. 

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.600
You have a 100% solution of
something like this, you take 

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.500
a little bunny rabbit with the
ears and sort of 

00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.033
lower this thing in-- 

00:27:41.033 --> 00:27:44.267
this thing is just simply torn
to pieces. 

00:27:44.267 --> 00:27:46.833
Then you pull this thing out,
there's just bones. 

00:27:46.833 --> 00:27:51.500
I mean, this is tremendously
reactive! 

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.667
So all of these things, you have
to handle ‘em, and you've 

00:27:53.667 --> 00:27:55.533
got to get them into your
spectrometer. 

00:27:55.533 --> 00:27:56.567
But OK. 

00:27:56.567 --> 00:27:59.367
So when you do this, you see the
OH bonds-- 

00:27:59.367 --> 00:28:02.933
see the dots here on this? 

00:28:02.933 --> 00:28:04.733
This is 88 kcal per mole. 

00:28:04.733 --> 00:28:07.467
This is a lot different than
these guys. 

00:28:07.467 --> 00:28:10.200
And of course, the one that
you're really 

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.233
interested in is water. 

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:16.300
The bond energy for water is
118. 

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.467
And that goes to OH dot and H
atom. 

00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:24.233
This is an important number. 

00:28:24.233 --> 00:28:28.500
And remember, water covers 70%
of the earth's surface. 

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.167
Here, you're making 
a list of what are

00:28:30.167 --> 00:28:31.533
the most stable compounds 

00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:34.067
that God made, it's N2 in
the air. 

00:28:34.067 --> 00:28:37.067
80% of the air we're breathing
is N2. 

00:28:37.067 --> 00:28:38.400
N2 has got a triple bond. 

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.467
It's indestructible. 

00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:41.133
Very, very stable. 

00:28:41.133 --> 00:28:43.500
The sand on beaches. 

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.000
I mean, the silicon dioxide, the
sand, is just like a rock. 

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.400
I mean, it is a rock. 

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.200
And then the other thing is
water. 

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.800
70% of the earth's surface. 

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.900
And the reason it's so stable
is, if you want to break this 

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.233
apart to radicals, you've got to
give me 118 kcal per mole. 

00:29:02.233 --> 00:29:05.033
That's a whopping amount of
energy. 

00:29:05.033 --> 00:29:05.667
Here. 

00:29:05.667 --> 00:29:09.467
And so you notice, if you just
replace this with an 

00:29:09.467 --> 00:29:11.567
ethyl group, OK? 

00:29:11.567 --> 00:29:12.867
So you make ethanol. 

00:29:12.867 --> 00:29:17.067
So the bond energy's going to
drop by almost a volt to 104 

00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:19.400
kcal per mole. 

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.900
Here. 

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:23.400
Imagine you have a swimming
pool. 

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.567
So it's a swimming pool. 

00:29:24.567 --> 00:29:26.400
Johnny Depp is talking to
somebody next to 

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:27.300
the swimming pool. 

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.467
Only instead of the swimming
pool, you have 

00:29:28.467 --> 00:29:29.833
water, you have ethanol. 

00:29:29.833 --> 00:29:31.167
It's vodka in there. 

00:29:31.167 --> 00:29:33.567
So Johnny Depp takes a drag on a
cigarette, and as he's 

00:29:33.567 --> 00:29:36.333
talking to Angelina Jolie, he
flicks the thing over. 

00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:39.700
And the split second this hits
the pool, there's a flame like 

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.500
180 meters high. 

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.033
Because the ethanol ignites! 

00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:45.600
It burns. 

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.200
If it's in water, the cigarette
goes out. 

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:54.933
So this bond energy-- if it's a
real stable compound, this 

00:29:54.933 --> 00:29:56.800
has consequences. 

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:57.133
OK. 

00:29:57.133 --> 00:30:00.300
The last thing I'll tell you
is...Here. 

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.367
These are the bond energies I
just told you for methanol. 

00:30:04.367 --> 00:30:05.933
This is the OH bond. 

00:30:05.933 --> 00:30:07.433
This is the CH bond. 

00:30:07.433 --> 00:30:09.567
The weakest bond is the CO bond.

00:30:09.567 --> 00:30:12.167
These are these numbers in kcal
per mole. 

00:30:12.167 --> 00:30:14.333
It's always interesting. 

00:30:14.333 --> 00:30:18.267
If you knew what these bond
energies are, what are the 

00:30:18.267 --> 00:30:20.333
bond energies for the radicals?

00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:25.233
So if I reach in and cut a bond
here and I make methoxy dot, 

00:30:25.233 --> 00:30:31.967
if I make methoxy dot, now the
bond energy for the CH bond-- 

00:30:31.967 --> 00:30:34.533
Here, I can use the meter
stick-- 

00:30:34.533 --> 00:30:40.500
the CH bond, which used to be 96
kcal per mole, drops to 22. 

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.733
You can see why. 

00:30:41.733 --> 00:30:45.133
The minute you cut the bond
here, the hydrogen atom 

00:30:45.133 --> 00:30:48.567
leaves, but this dot couples
with that dot, and you've got 

00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:49.667
formaldehyde. 

00:30:49.667 --> 00:30:52.300
Nice, stable compound. 

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.933
And the CO bond here is about 90
kcal per mole. 

00:30:55.933 --> 00:30:58.000
This is about the same thing it
is for 

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.833
the CO bond in methanol. 

00:31:01.833 --> 00:31:04.767
You go to the other bond, which
is hydroxy methyl. 

00:31:04.767 --> 00:31:07.033
You go to this species. 

00:31:07.033 --> 00:31:10.800
Again, if you cut the bond off
the OH bond, you get a dot 

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.300
here, and the other dot then
combines back here with 

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:13.833
formaldehyde. 

00:31:13.833 --> 00:31:16.600
So now this is 30 kcal per mole,
to be 

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.200
contrasted with 106. 

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.500
What's interesting is the CO
bond, which used 

00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:26.100
to be 92, goes up. 

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.100
I don't know why, but it does. 

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.500
And not by a little bit. 

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.000
This is almost a volt. 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.533
So there's all sorts of
interesting patterns you can 

00:31:35.533 --> 00:31:37.100
have in these bond energies. 

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:45.100
And you literally can have...you
can look at that

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.067
not only these
alcohols, but all

00:31:48.067 --> 00:31:52.833
sorts of alkyl peroxides and a
variety of these things. 

00:31:53.533 --> 00:31:55.933
OK. Here.

00:31:55.933 --> 00:31:57.933
I'm going to finish early, 
you can see. 

00:31:57.933 --> 00:31:59.767
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: There'll be
questions. 

00:31:59.767 --> 00:32:01.733
PROFESSOR ELLISON: So here
there's another thing

00:32:01.733 --> 00:32:02.933
I want to show you. 

00:32:02.933 --> 00:32:08.133
And that is, when you talk about
what a bond strength is, 

00:32:08.133 --> 00:32:11.667
it turns out that an early way
that people tried to measure 

00:32:11.667 --> 00:32:13.833
bond strengths would be that
you'd consider a 

00:32:13.833 --> 00:32:14.767
molecule like methane-- 

00:32:14.767 --> 00:32:16.700
I need my big stick here-- 

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:22.433
and you take methane, you can
burn it, and you can actually 

00:32:22.433 --> 00:32:25.700
measure the energy to take this
apart to a carbon atom 

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.933
and four hydrogens. 

00:32:26.933 --> 00:32:33.433
So Chupka described to you how
you would measure the energies 

00:32:33.433 --> 00:32:36.567
of individual carbon atoms. You
can actually work out that 

00:32:36.567 --> 00:32:42.433
the bond, to break all four
bonds in methane is going to 

00:32:42.433 --> 00:32:46.800
cost you 497.5 kcal per mole. 

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.067
Since there's four bonds in
methane, you'd cross yourself, 

00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:52.233
think of Jesus, and then just
divide by four. 

00:32:52.233 --> 00:32:55.900
And if you did that, that number
divided by four is 99 

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:58.200
kcal per mole. 

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.400
And so you figure, that must be
sort of the 

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.133
average bond energy. 

00:33:02.133 --> 00:33:05.000
If you go through these cycles,
like I just told you, 

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.900
you can actually measure
individually. 

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:15.433
The first bond is 104.99 plus or
minus 0.03 kcal per mole. 

00:33:15.433 --> 00:33:17.633
And that's the first bond
energy. 

00:33:17.633 --> 00:33:19.567
That gives you the absolute heat
of formation of a 

00:33:19.567 --> 00:33:20.733
methyl radical. 

00:33:20.733 --> 00:33:23.933
You can now take methyl radical
and 

00:33:23.933 --> 00:33:25.200
measure the second bond. 

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.067
Notice the bond energy goes up
from 105 to 110. 

00:33:30.067 --> 00:33:33.967
Then the third one is 101, and
the last one 

00:33:33.967 --> 00:33:35.500
is 90 kcal per mole. 

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.600
And these guys give you,
individually, the heats of 

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:40.367
formation of all of these
species. 

00:33:40.367 --> 00:33:44.467
Notice that not a single one of
these bond energies equals 

00:33:44.467 --> 00:33:46.600
that average. 

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.567
Here it's close, but the
uncertainties are such that 

00:33:50.567 --> 00:33:52.200
it's not quite. 

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.533
And so using these average bond
energies, you've got to 

00:33:55.533 --> 00:33:57.133
be careful. 

00:33:57.133 --> 00:33:59.833
The other thing I'll also tell
you, if you actually take the 

00:33:59.833 --> 00:34:03.800
sum of these numbers and add
them up, it's 397.5. It's 

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:06.200
exactly this. 

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:09.833
And this is a testament to the
guys who did these 

00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:10.300
measurements. 

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.267
These are very hard experiments
to do, and that 

00:34:12.267 --> 00:34:14.067
means that each one of these
four numbers is right. 

00:34:14.067 --> 00:34:16.133
Because you know, this thing has
to be right. 

00:34:16.133 --> 00:34:18.967
The four of these guys have to
add to these things. 

00:34:18.967 --> 00:34:21.733
So here. If the sum of these
things is this, that means the 

00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:23.667
first law of thermodynamics
really works. 

00:34:23.667 --> 00:34:32.233
So this is a very interesting
set of experiments to do. 

00:34:32.233 --> 00:34:32.533
OK. 

00:34:32.533 --> 00:34:35.033
So here. 

00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:36.067
I'm going to give you people-- 

00:34:36.067 --> 00:34:37.500
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Let's have
some questions. 

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:37.700
PROFESSOR ELLISON: OK. 

00:34:37.700 --> 00:34:41.033
So I'm allowed to show my last
little picture, then. 

00:34:41.033 --> 00:34:43.000
Here. 

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.500
I'm in Boulder, Colorado, and
we're not as sophisticated as 

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.767
you people here are in New
Haven. 

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:54.533
So this is me. 

00:34:54.533 --> 00:34:57.400
Carl Lineberger is the captain
of the negative ions. 

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.900
The smartest guy in the world
about doing negative ion 

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.300
spectroscopy. 

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:05.667
Chuck DePuy here is a Yale PhD,
is a member of the 

00:35:05.667 --> 00:35:07.600
National Academy of Sciences. 

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.433
He's an organic chemist in
Boulder. 

00:35:09.433 --> 00:35:12.067
Eldon Ferguson is the inventor
of the flowing afterglow. 

00:35:12.067 --> 00:35:12.867
It was at NOAA. 

00:35:12.867 --> 00:35:15.200
The National Oceanic and
Atmospheric 

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.933
Administration in Boulder. 

00:35:17.933 --> 00:35:22.067
This is Steve Leone, who's one
of the most famous chemical 

00:35:22.067 --> 00:35:23.333
physicists in the United States.

00:35:23.333 --> 00:35:24.933
He's now at Berkeley. 

00:35:24.933 --> 00:35:27.800
He's the head of the Chemical
Dynamics Beamline out there. 

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:33.600
Zdenek Herman was a postdoc here
in the 1960s, and he's at 

00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:37.333
the Academy of Sciences in
Prague. 

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:42.500
And this is Roni Bierbaum, who's
the master of negative 

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.667
ion chemistry. 

00:35:43.667 --> 00:35:46.967
So I've given you about ten
minutes early, so I'm happy to 

00:35:46.967 --> 00:35:57.467
answer any questions that you
people may have. 

00:35:57.467 --> 00:35:57.967
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: OK. 

00:35:57.967 --> 00:35:59.467
Do you have any questions or
comments? 

00:36:03.533 --> 00:36:06.300
OK, I have one. 

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:07.600
So let's go back to your-- 

00:36:10.867 --> 00:36:11.800
how do we get out of here? 

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.967
PROFESSOR ELLISON: Oh, you hit a
B? 

00:36:14.967 --> 00:36:16.800
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: But I want
to go back to the beginning. 

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.267
Let's, for what it's worth-- 

00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:28.400
here we go. 

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:34.867
That, hold up that spectrum you
showed that had vibrational 

00:36:34.867 --> 00:36:36.100
in here. 

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:37.333
PROFESSOR ELLISON: That's right.

00:36:40.367 --> 00:36:42.000
Yes, there it is. 

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.000
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Now, do
people understand 

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.700
how this was working? 

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:56.133
You put the laser energy in, and
you measure this 

00:36:56.133 --> 00:36:56.500
difference, right? 

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:57.733
PROFESSOR ELLISON: That's right.

00:36:57.733 --> 00:36:59.533
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: But
sometimes some of the energy

00:36:59.533 --> 00:37:01.800
went into vibration 
of the molecule. 

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:06.833
So the energy that came out was
smaller, to the extent 

00:37:06.833 --> 00:37:10.567
that vibration actually went
into the molecule. 

00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:14.167
So here, you say, is when no
vibrational energy goes into 

00:37:14.167 --> 00:37:15.433
the product. 

00:37:17.267 --> 00:37:19.867
So that's how you know what the
lowest energy is. 

00:37:19.867 --> 00:37:22.033
But here's a peak here. 

00:37:22.033 --> 00:37:22.833
PROFESSOR ELLISON: Right. 

00:37:22.833 --> 00:37:25.767
So that comes from the fact that
you have a vibrationally 

00:37:25.767 --> 00:37:27.467
excited negative ion. 

00:37:27.467 --> 00:37:29.967
The negative ion, instead of
being in its ground 

00:37:29.967 --> 00:37:32.967
vibrational state, has a little
bit of energy. 

00:37:32.967 --> 00:37:35.767
And it will actually be in the
CO stretch, is 

00:37:35.767 --> 00:37:36.967
where this will be. 

00:37:36.967 --> 00:37:42.500
So if there's energy in the
negative ion, then, to go back 

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.767
to my diagram-- 

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:53.300
if you have hot bands, in other
words, if some of the 

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:58.033
molecules have vibrational
energy in this, then the 

00:37:58.033 --> 00:38:01.000
molecules aren't down here, y
equal to zero, but they're 

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.567
actually populated in higher
states here. 

00:38:04.567 --> 00:38:06.967
So that means that those
electrons will take less 

00:38:06.967 --> 00:38:08.767
kinetic energy to get off. 

00:38:08.767 --> 00:38:11.833
And you can always spot them,
because they'll have a 

00:38:11.833 --> 00:38:13.100
different frequency. 

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.433
Here. 

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:24.800
You're going to have a set of
frequencies here, which will 

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.000
be a mode in the neutral
molecule. 

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.367
This is the methoxy radical, and
this is that of the 

00:38:31.367 --> 00:38:32.267
negative ion. 

00:38:32.267 --> 00:38:34.333
And so this is a vibration in
the negative ion. 

00:38:34.333 --> 00:38:36.067
And they'll be different,
because the electrons are 

00:38:36.067 --> 00:38:37.700
different in these things. 

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:44.133
So you can guess, when you get
to a molecule which gets to be 

00:38:44.133 --> 00:38:47.733
more complex, like phenoxy
radical-- 

00:38:47.733 --> 00:38:49.133
I talked to you about that-- 

00:38:49.133 --> 00:38:53.433
phenoxy radical has a lot more
atoms. So analyzing this 

00:38:53.433 --> 00:38:56.300
steadily gets more and more
difficult. 

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.233
But we like to do that. 

00:38:57.233 --> 00:38:58.867
That's what God put us on this
earth for. 

00:39:02.167 --> 00:39:04.333
You can also guess-- 

00:39:04.333 --> 00:39:06.200
I'm interested right now in
sugars, because I'm interested 

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.400
in how biomass decomposes. 

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.967
You know what glucose looks
like? 

00:39:09.967 --> 00:39:14.933
Glucose is a molecule that has
many different hydroxyls on 

00:39:14.933 --> 00:39:17.900
it, and hydroxyls are all
slightly different. 

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.300
So now, instead of making a
negative ion like in methoxy-- 

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.567
I mean, how hard can this be? 

00:39:22.567 --> 00:39:23.967
You've only got one OH. 

00:39:23.967 --> 00:39:27.267
What happens if you add ethylene
glycol, or if you 

00:39:27.267 --> 00:39:28.233
take glycerol-- 

00:39:28.233 --> 00:39:31.333
ethylene glycol has two
hydroxyls, glycerol has three, 

00:39:31.333 --> 00:39:34.900
threose is going to have four,
ribose is going to have five. 

00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:36.733
So now you're going to have to
begin to tell which 

00:39:36.733 --> 00:39:39.433
OH this came from. 

00:39:39.433 --> 00:39:41.600
So this is going to be a bitch.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.133
But you if you can do this, you
would be able to take 

00:39:44.133 --> 00:39:47.433
these molecules, and you'll be
able to break all the bonds in 

00:39:47.433 --> 00:39:51.000
the order that you'd like to do
it. 

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.733
And that's very interesting to
do. 

00:39:54.733 --> 00:39:58.967
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: So you were
very kind to speak about putting

00:39:58.967 --> 00:40:01.200
electrons in the sigma star
orbitals. 

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.167
You don't believe in the sigma*
orbitals. 

00:40:05.967 --> 00:40:07.833
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE:
Ellison is not a big

00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:09.300
fan of molecular orbitals. 

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:09.767
I think. 

00:40:09.767 --> 00:40:10.733
Is that true? 

00:40:10.733 --> 00:40:12.400
PROFESSOR ELLISON: Yes. 

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.467
Yes, that is true. 

00:40:14.467 --> 00:40:18.467
Look, I do valence bond work. 

00:40:18.467 --> 00:40:20.900
This is a matter of taste. 

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.400
There's different ways to view
these things. 

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:26.533
And in the end, the only thing
that 

00:40:26.533 --> 00:40:27.767
counts is what you measure. 

00:40:32.033 --> 00:40:34.133
Here, if you have a 
model that can

00:40:34.133 --> 00:40:37.133
account for the patterns that 

00:40:37.133 --> 00:40:41.600
you've measured, and you can
predict what the next values 

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:45.467
are going to be, you understand
this. 

00:40:45.467 --> 00:40:47.800
But it's the data is what
survives. 

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.200
The rest of it is all a matter
of opinion. 

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.067
He likes sigma* orbitals, I
don't. 

00:40:56.033 --> 00:40:59.700
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: You were
talking about the stability of

00:40:59.733 --> 00:41:04.233
the phenoxy radical, in terms of
its resonant stabilization. 

00:41:04.233 --> 00:41:07.667
So I think these people could
help you out with that. 

00:41:07.667 --> 00:41:09.333
Or at least point out something
interesting 

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:18.967
Would you say that this radical
is stable because you 

00:41:18.967 --> 00:41:21.733
can draw resonance 
structures that have

00:41:21.733 --> 00:41:21.933
the electrons over here.

00:41:21.933 --> 00:41:23.433
PROFESSOR ELLISON: Yes, that's
right. 

00:41:23.433 --> 00:41:24.200
Correct. 

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.533
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: But how
about if you say that

00:41:27.533 --> 00:41:30.500
in the starting

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.700
phenol, that's the bond that
you're going to 

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.200
break in here, right? 

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.000
Here I've got a pair of
electrons that I can draw 

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.767
resonance structures for. 

00:41:40.767 --> 00:41:41.867
So it looks to me like it's
worth more 

00:41:41.867 --> 00:41:43.933
here than it is here. 

00:41:43.933 --> 00:41:46.600
PROFESSOR ELLISON: Listen, dream
on, big boy. 

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.700
Look-- 

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:52.133
Here, how do I push this thing
up? 

00:41:52.133 --> 00:41:53.400
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: OK, we'll
get that. 

00:42:00.467 --> 00:42:01.700
PROFESSOR ELLISON: Here. 

00:42:18.367 --> 00:42:21.767
So this electron is going to get
delocalized 

00:42:21.767 --> 00:42:22.867
over the whole molecule. 

00:42:22.867 --> 00:42:26.533
If you try to do this with an
electron pair, what you're 

00:42:26.533 --> 00:42:27.800
going to have is-- 

00:42:32.633 --> 00:42:33.533
OK. 

00:42:33.533 --> 00:42:46.400
So if I do that, I'm pushing
charges around. 

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.633
Well, I don't like that. 

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:54.000
I don't like the fact that the
oxygen is going to have-- 

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.033
you're starting to suck
electrons-- 

00:42:57.033 --> 00:43:01.933
if the electrons migrate down,
the oxygen is going to become 

00:43:01.933 --> 00:43:03.200
positively charged. 

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.567
So jeez, I just would never do
that. 

00:43:05.567 --> 00:43:06.400
But here. 

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.933
But what's true is that bond
energy, honest to God, really 

00:43:09.933 --> 00:43:12.033
and truly, is 86 kcal per mole.

00:43:12.033 --> 00:43:13.067
That is a fact. 

00:43:13.067 --> 00:43:22.233
And this is a flippant way to
have anticipated this. 

00:43:22.233 --> 00:43:33.067
Contrast that with, say, methoxy
dot-- where's that 

00:43:33.067 --> 00:43:34.500
electron going to go? 

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.767
It's really stapled to the
oxygen atom. 

00:43:36.767 --> 00:43:37.933
There's nothing it can do. 

00:43:37.933 --> 00:43:40.300
It can't go anywhere. 

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:51.500
So when you break that bond, you
get hydrogen atom. 

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:52.300
You get the dot that's just

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.900
stuck right there. 

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:59.800
As you pull this bond off, the
dot now is able to be 

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:04.367
delocalized and spread around
the whole ring, and this bond 

00:44:04.367 --> 00:44:11.400
energy, then, in phenol, this
bond energy that's going to be 

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.667
86 kcal per mole-- 

00:44:13.667 --> 00:44:16.200
this thing lets you measure the
absolute heat of formation 

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:24.800
298 of this thing. 

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:29.633
This low bond energy is going to
mean that this heat of 

00:44:29.633 --> 00:44:32.733
formation is going to be low. 

00:44:32.733 --> 00:44:36.667
So what that means is, if we're
trying to study lignin, 

00:44:36.667 --> 00:44:38.333
and lignin are trees-- 

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:44.433
you take a chainsaw and you're
cutting trees down, that's 

00:44:44.433 --> 00:44:46.833
very tough material. 

00:44:46.833 --> 00:44:54.100
All these compounds are long,
three-dimensional polymers of 

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.867
aryl alkyl ethers. 

00:44:55.867 --> 00:44:58.633
So if you know the heat of
formation of the phenoxy 

00:44:58.633 --> 00:45:04.567
radical, this bond turns out to
be 62 kcal per mole. 

00:45:04.567 --> 00:45:12.733
And if you do this in this, it's
like 90. 

00:45:12.733 --> 00:45:15.067
And that's a volt and a half. 

00:45:15.067 --> 00:45:19.633
So when you heat this, all these
molecules break apart, and the 

00:45:19.633 --> 00:45:22.500
first thing they do is they form
phenoxy radicals. 

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:26.567
And this triggers the
decomposition of these things. 

00:45:26.567 --> 00:45:32.933
So it turns out, I don't like
these things in the neutral 

00:45:32.933 --> 00:45:34.267
molecule being delocalized. 

00:45:34.267 --> 00:45:36.200
Because I think you have to
separate charge, and 

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.267
I don't like that. 

00:45:39.267 --> 00:45:40.700
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: There are
actually people back there who

00:45:40.733 --> 00:45:43.233
are smart at this kind of stuff.

00:45:43.233 --> 00:45:46.200
Do you guys buy that? 

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.433
PROFESSOR ELLISON: You? 

00:45:52.567 --> 00:45:55.067
STUDENT: What I'm thinking is,
if you have that kind of 

00:45:55.067 --> 00:45:59.567
species, you'd think there'd be
a spin observable. 

00:45:59.567 --> 00:46:01.667
PROFESSOR ELLISON: Oh, indeed
there is. 

00:46:01.667 --> 00:46:08.000
If you look at the EPR spectrum
of this radical, it 

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.600
is delocalized all over the
place. 

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.633
And here, you're an expert in
this. 

00:46:11.633 --> 00:46:13.133
You know about all these
hyperfine 

00:46:13.133 --> 00:46:14.033
couplings and whatnot. 

00:46:14.033 --> 00:46:14.800
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Yes, there's
coupling 

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:15.900
from the protons around here. 

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:19.133
It's like NMR. So if the
electron spin gets out on 

00:46:19.133 --> 00:46:22.167
these protons, then it interacts
with the nucleus, even 

00:46:22.167 --> 00:46:24.967
if the molecule's tumbling, you
don't have to worry about 

00:46:24.967 --> 00:46:26.767
the anisotropy. 

00:46:26.767 --> 00:46:29.400
So it's no doubt it gets
delocalized, but why 

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:30.133
doesn't this one? 

00:46:30.133 --> 00:46:35.367
So Barney says it's because he
doesn't like to separate 

00:46:35.367 --> 00:46:37.233
charge in resonance structures.

00:46:37.233 --> 00:46:40.633
But that's not-- is this
Coulomb's law, or what? 

00:46:40.633 --> 00:46:42.067
Anybody got an idea back there?

00:46:47.300 --> 00:46:48.800
PROFESSOR ELLISON: Well, here. 

00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:50.833
What do you mean, is this
Coulomb's law? 

00:46:50.833 --> 00:46:52.400
Coulomb's law is what it is. 

00:46:55.267 --> 00:46:56.500
So here. 

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:04.167
If resonance forms like this are
important, then that means 

00:47:04.167 --> 00:47:06.933
that I think, as a consequence
of this, you have to have 

00:47:06.933 --> 00:47:07.600
charge separation. 

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:09.967
And I think these are
high-energy resonance forms. 

00:47:09.967 --> 00:47:12.000
And if they're high-energy
resonance forms, they don't 

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.933
contribute to the superposition
in the wave 

00:47:13.933 --> 00:47:16.800
function, is the way I say that.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.233
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: That's
because you

00:47:17.233 --> 00:47:18.933
believe in resonance. 

00:47:18.933 --> 00:47:22.200
G.BARNEY ELLISON: Because I'm a
valence-bond guy. But what's

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:26.467
true is this 86 kcal per mole.
Nothing can be done about that.

00:47:26.467 --> 00:47:27.533
OK. 
951
00:47:27,533 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: OK. I think
we can thank Professor Ellison.

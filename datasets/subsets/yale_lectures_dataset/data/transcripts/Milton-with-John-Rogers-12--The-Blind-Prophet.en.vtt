00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.625
Professor John
Rogers: It's not until Book

00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:09.220
Three of Paradise Lost
that the poet explicitly reveals

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.924
to us,
to his readers,

00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:14.937
the fact of the physical
handicap that might reasonably

00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:19.620
be thought to render impossible
his composition of the poem.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.310
It's not until Book Three,
until after Milton presents his

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.329
heroic portrait of Satan and his
heroic portrait of the fallen

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:34.020
angels when he establishes the
fact of his blindness.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.175
So I'm going to be devoting
this lecture to Milton's

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:43.308
representation of his blindness
and especially to the invocation

00:00:43.308 --> 00:00:46.730
of light with which Book Three
begins,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.758
because I'm absolutely
convinced that a feeling for the

00:00:50.758 --> 00:00:54.787
phenomenon of Milton's blindness
is crucial to any real

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:59.660
understanding of this poem,
certainly, but also of this

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.048
poet.
One of the questions that I

00:01:02.048 --> 00:01:05.821
want here to pursue is the
question of why Milton -- with

00:01:05.821 --> 00:01:09.956
the exception of an oblique,
and it's really a very oblique,

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:13.521
reference in the opening
invocation -- why Milton waits

00:01:13.521 --> 00:01:17.616
until now,
until the third book of his

00:01:17.616 --> 00:01:23.129
epic, to divulge his blindness
to his reader.

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:28.519
Milton began to lose his
eyesight around 1646.

00:01:28.519 --> 00:01:33.034
This is when he's in his late
thirties and he was entirely

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:37.152
blind by February of 1652,
and that was at the age of

00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:39.427
forty-four.
According to one of the

00:01:39.427 --> 00:01:42.310
earliest biographers -- and
really usefully and wonderfully,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.833
Merritt Hughes includes in the
back of the Hughes edition most

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:49.800
of the earliest biographies of
Milton.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.989
They make for fascinating
reading.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:55.196
These are sketches of the poet
written very shortly after

00:01:55.196 --> 00:01:57.759
Milton's death.
According to one of these

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.448
biographers, Milton subjected
himself to a range of medical

00:02:01.448 --> 00:02:06.887
procedures in order to cure,
or at least to forestall,

00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:13.129
the darkness that was about to
set over him.

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.565
He imbibed a lot of potent
medicines -- obviously they were

00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:20.119
ineffective -- and he endured
the indignity of that procedure

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:23.732
that was most commonly deployed
in the seventeenth century for

00:02:23.732 --> 00:02:26.280
the treatment of any serious
disease,

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.379
and that was the process of
bloodletting.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:35.740
We have to imagine that,
as was the case for other men

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.740
and women who underwent some
onset of blindness,

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.146
small incisions would be made
in the skin around Milton's eyes

00:02:46.146 --> 00:02:50.697
and a quantity of blood would be
drained at regular intervals in

00:02:50.697 --> 00:02:54.310
order to empty the body of the
harmful toxins,

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.216
or its "ill humors," that were
believed to produce this

00:02:58.216 --> 00:03:01.400
terrible malady.The medical
community,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.036
of course, was not able to
forestall the failure of

00:03:05.036 --> 00:03:07.510
Milton's eyes and so,
as I said,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.183
Milton was blind by 1652.
Milton would never see his

00:03:13.183 --> 00:03:15.885
fourth child,
a daughter born three months

00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:18.389
after the onset of total
blindness.

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:22.072
He would never again see the
face of his wife,

00:03:22.072 --> 00:03:25.509
Mary Powell,
when she died three days after

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:29.575
the child's birth;
nor could he witness the death

00:03:29.575 --> 00:03:32.899
of his only son,
John Jr., which occurred six

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.170
weeks after that.
And finally,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.528
Milton would never see the face
of Katherine Woodcock,

00:03:38.528 --> 00:03:42.456
the woman he married four years
later and who soon herself died

00:03:42.456 --> 00:03:46.856
in childbirth,
nor would he ever see the face

00:03:46.856 --> 00:03:52.504
of Elizabeth Minshull whom he
married nine years after

00:03:52.504 --> 00:03:56.340
that.Why did Milton go
blind?

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.484
Reasonable conjecture leads us
to think that it was either

00:04:01.484 --> 00:04:05.607
glaucoma or cataracts,
but of course our business here

00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:09.584
has nothing to do with the real
causes of Milton's blindness but

00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:11.919
with Milton's literary
figuration,

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:15.379
his representation of the
causes of his blindness.

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.772
I am convinced that one of the
most powerful determinants in

00:04:19.772 --> 00:04:23.941
Milton's late writings is
Milton's drive to ascertain and

00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:28.110
then also to justify the cause
of his loss of sight.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.770
I think you have throughout the
late writings really a

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.518
proliferation of explanations
and justifications of his

00:04:37.518 --> 00:04:41.319
blindness,
and they really fill Milton's

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:46.723
writing throughout the entire
period from 1650 to his death in

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:51.773
1674.First let us consider
how Milton's contemporaries

00:04:51.773 --> 00:04:56.276
interpreted his blindness.
Milton's world fell into total

00:04:56.276 --> 00:04:59.847
darkness a little less than a
year after he finished his great

00:04:59.847 --> 00:05:02.540
and really quite daring
political treatise,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.511
the First Defense of the
English People,

00:05:05.511 --> 00:05:09.888
which was published in 1651.
This was the last of Milton's

00:05:09.888 --> 00:05:13.736
regicide treatises.
It was written in Latin because

00:05:13.736 --> 00:05:18.069
the new commonwealth government
had commissioned John Milton to

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:22.471
justify the unprecedented act of
regicide to the entire European

00:05:22.471 --> 00:05:24.941
community,
which is why Milton didn't

00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:27.767
write it in English.
Milton was responsible for

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:31.766
explaining to all of Europe why
the English people had beheaded

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:35.507
their king and why they had set
up a new government on what

00:05:35.507 --> 00:05:38.538
Milton considered to be
idealistic non-monarchic

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:41.971
principles.
Now most of Milton's readers on

00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:46.293
the continent were appalled by
England's action and appalled

00:05:46.293 --> 00:05:49.589
especially by Milton's defense
of England.

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:53.554
It was widely thought -- not
only on the continent but also

00:05:53.554 --> 00:05:57.245
by a lot of Milton's fellow
Englishmen -- it was widely

00:05:57.245 --> 00:06:01.277
thought that God himself had
blinded Milton specifically for

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:05.370
his writing against the king.
Milton was the subject of a

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.898
number of sermons that were
delivered from the pulpits by

00:06:08.898 --> 00:06:13.190
conservative Anglican churches,
and the sermons pointed to

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.403
Milton as an example.
Milton was an example:

00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:20.203
"Look what happens to those who
lift their hand against God's

00:06:20.203 --> 00:06:23.949
anointed king.
Look what happened to Milton.

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.485
He was punished with blindness
for writing his defense of the

00:06:28.485 --> 00:06:32.794
regicide."It's in response
to just this type of common

00:06:32.794 --> 00:06:36.877
accusation that Milton writes
that lovely sonnet to his

00:06:36.877 --> 00:06:39.829
friend,
Mr. Cyriack Skinner.

00:06:39.829 --> 00:06:42.529
This is on page 170 in the
Hughes.

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:44.694
This is the sonnet in which
Milton insists,

00:06:44.694 --> 00:06:47.477
just as he will in the
Second Defense of the English

00:06:47.477 --> 00:06:50.157
People,
that his blindness has nothing

00:06:50.157 --> 00:06:52.509
whatsoever to do with an act of
God.

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:56.467
In the poem to Cyriack Skinner,
Milton's been totally blind for

00:06:56.467 --> 00:07:00.676
about three years now,
and he begins the sonnet to his

00:07:00.676 --> 00:07:04.821
friend like this:
"Cyriack, this three years' day

00:07:04.821 --> 00:07:08.900
these eyes,
though clear / to outward view

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.779
of blemish or of spot,
/ bereft of light thir seeing

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.892
have forgot."
Milton writes repeatedly

00:07:16.892 --> 00:07:20.124
throughout this period that
despite his blindness,

00:07:20.124 --> 00:07:24.081
his eyes appear -- and this is
incredibly important to him --

00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:27.839
they appear to outward view to
be perfectly healthy.

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:31.607
He continually clears himself
of any wrongdoing by insisting

00:07:31.607 --> 00:07:35.055
that his eyes are clear of
blemish or of spot -- or any

00:07:35.055 --> 00:07:37.983
sign,
that is, I have to assume,

00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:41.060
of sin or of corruption or
blame.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.632
So far from being robbed of
light by God,

00:07:43.632 --> 00:07:47.361
his eyes have simply -- and
isn't this a lovely metaphor --

00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:50.319
his eyes have simply forgotten
how to see.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:53.850
You'll remember how important,
how redemptive actually,

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:57.577
the idea of forgetting had
become to Milton in Paradise

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:00.480
Lost.Now,
Milton goes even further in the

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.360
sonnet in exculpating himself.
Look at line ten.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:08.168
This is where he claims that he
is supported by his conscience,

00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:12.667
his knowledge that he willingly
sacrificed his eyes for the

00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:15.769
patriotic goal of political
liberty.

00:08:15.769 --> 00:08:22.395
Milton is talking of his eyes
here: " lost them overplied / in

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:25.870
liberty's defense,
my noble task,

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:31.410
/ Of which all Europe talks
from side to side."

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:35.611
He ruined his eyesight with the
tireless labor that he devoted

00:08:35.611 --> 00:08:39.330
to writing that first defense of
the English people.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.094
Milton sacrificed his eyes for
the freedom of his countrymen,

00:08:43.094 --> 00:08:45.980
the noble task for which he was
compensated.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.150
He was compensated with the
talk of all of Europe,

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.892
he was a celebrity.
According to this formulation,

00:08:52.892 --> 00:08:56.862
Milton has knowingly and
willingly bought fame as a

00:08:56.862 --> 00:08:59.879
political liberator with the
noble,

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:02.682
sacrificial payment of his
eyes.Now,

00:09:02.682 --> 00:09:07.064
this is the claim that Milton's
making publicly in these poems

00:09:07.064 --> 00:09:10.370
in this period and in the prose
treatises.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:13.711
It's a claim for the nobility
of the tragic condition that he

00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:16.348
finds himself in,
and so in all of Milton's

00:09:16.348 --> 00:09:20.262
public poetry and prose Milton
asserts his blindness as a point

00:09:20.262 --> 00:09:22.492
of pride.
He even goes so far in the

00:09:22.492 --> 00:09:25.889
Second Defense of the English
People to claim that his

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:28.720
blindness is actually a sign of
God's election;

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.286
God has chosen him,
and it's an incredibly

00:09:31.286 --> 00:09:33.916
beautiful image,
the image of Milton's eyes

00:09:33.916 --> 00:09:37.784
being covered by heavenly wings,
by angel wings,

00:09:37.784 --> 00:09:41.397
almost as a favor.
He's continually asserting

00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:45.256
publicly that his blindness is a
sign of strength.But we have

00:09:45.256 --> 00:09:48.512
a more private and a more
personal consideration of his

00:09:48.512 --> 00:09:52.070
blindness in a letter that
Milton wrote to his friend,

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.158
Dr.
Leonard Philaras,

00:09:54.158 --> 00:09:58.649
the Athenian,
and this was in the packet.

00:09:58.649 --> 00:10:02.419
In the more private venue of
the personal letter,

00:10:02.419 --> 00:10:06.110
Milton seems in some ways to
lower his guard,

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:10.608
and he makes a powerful and
moving plea for a cure because

00:10:10.608 --> 00:10:15.909
he's writing to a doctor.
Look in the packet.

00:10:15.909 --> 00:10:17.590
This is around page sixty in
the packet.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:20.759
The original page number is
722, I believe.

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:23.695
Milton's articulating here for
the doctor the history of his

00:10:23.695 --> 00:10:25.935
loss of sight and the nature of
his condition:

00:10:25.935 --> 00:10:29.070
"It is ten years,
I think, more or less,

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:34.389
since I noticed my sight
becoming weak and growing dim,

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:38.693
and at the same time my spleen
and all my viscera are burdened

00:10:38.693 --> 00:10:42.354
and shaken with flatulence."
After this account of

00:10:42.354 --> 00:10:46.178
intestinal discomfort,
Milton then describes the mist

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:49.120
that began to appear in his left
eye;

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:52.549
Milton's left eye was the first
one to fail.

00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:57.768
Then a few sentences down he
describes the failure of the

00:10:57.768 --> 00:11:00.669
right eye:
The other eye also

00:11:00.669 --> 00:11:04.683
failing slowly and gradually
over a period of almost three

00:11:04.683 --> 00:11:09.120
years, some months before my
sight was completely destroyed.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.465
Everything which I
distinguished when I myself was

00:11:13.465 --> 00:11:16.836
still seemed to swim,
now to the right,

00:11:16.836 --> 00:11:20.846
now to the left.
Certain permanent vapors seemed

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:25.320
to have settled upon my entire
forehead and temples which press

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.722
and oppress my eyes with a sort
of sleepy heaviness especially

00:11:29.722 --> 00:11:34.654
from mealtime to evening.
In this letter to the doctor,

00:11:34.654 --> 00:11:39.564
Milton associates the onset of
his blindness with the onset of

00:11:39.564 --> 00:11:43.663
a gastrointestinal complaint,
and in doing this he's

00:11:43.663 --> 00:11:47.750
following the common wisdom
about the causes of blindness,

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.327
which was usually attributed in
the scientific community of the

00:11:52.327 --> 00:11:55.649
seventeenth century to a
digestive problem.

00:11:55.649 --> 00:11:59.363
For Milton, his most oppressive
pain burdened his forehead and

00:11:59.363 --> 00:12:02.529
his eyes in the hours following
the noontime meal,

00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:06.488
and the pain in his head
corresponded to a pain in his

00:12:06.488 --> 00:12:11.045
gut, which occurred presumably
in the same hours following the

00:12:11.045 --> 00:12:15.332
noontime meal,
as his entire frame was shaken

00:12:15.332 --> 00:12:20.130
with a violent flatulence.
This is the theory of how this

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:24.646
kind of digestive ailment caused
blindness: the digestive vapors

00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:28.660
that Milton or anyone who was
going blind was not able to

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.745
expel successfully through
normal digestion and the normal

00:12:32.745 --> 00:12:37.118
process of the passing of wind
-- these vapors were trapped in

00:12:37.118 --> 00:12:41.102
our poet's body.
They began gradually to rise up

00:12:41.102 --> 00:12:45.276
to his head over a period of
many months or even years where

00:12:45.276 --> 00:12:48.460
they settled into the sockets of
his eyes.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:54.305
Eventually they clouded over
his eyes and cut off all access

00:12:54.305 --> 00:12:59.025
to light from the outside.
Another way of putting this:

00:12:59.025 --> 00:13:03.055
the affliction that would alter
forever the last quarter of

00:13:03.055 --> 00:13:06.737
Milton's life had its ultimate
cause in the process of

00:13:06.737 --> 00:13:09.987
digestion.
Milton's greatest misery was

00:13:09.987 --> 00:13:14.954
quite simply the consequence --
and he may have believed this --

00:13:14.954 --> 00:13:18.659
the consequence of something he
ate.Now,

00:13:18.659 --> 00:13:22.811
you probably have no doubt
guessed why I'm emphasizing this

00:13:22.811 --> 00:13:26.248
particular figuration of
Milton's blindness as an

00:13:26.248 --> 00:13:30.399
irrevocable change that follows
the ingestion of food.

00:13:30.399 --> 00:13:34.957
The story of Milton's blindness
as he represents it brings us so

00:13:34.957 --> 00:13:38.139
perilously close to the story of
the Fall,

00:13:38.139 --> 00:13:41.752
which is, of course,
another narrative that imagines

00:13:41.752 --> 00:13:45.860
the inalterable and terrible
effects of something eaten.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.517
One critic, William Kerrigan,
in his brilliant analysis in

00:13:50.517 --> 00:13:55.501
the book The Sacred Complex
has called Paradise Lost

00:13:55.501 --> 00:14:01.588
the story of an evil meal.
It's important in the poem that

00:14:01.588 --> 00:14:06.156
Adam and Eve fall at noon.
The forbidden fruit is their

00:14:06.156 --> 00:14:08.867
noontime meal,
and it's possible that Kerrigan

00:14:08.867 --> 00:14:12.241
is right in aligning the
dynamics of the loss of paradise

00:14:12.241 --> 00:14:15.615
with the logic that Milton
employs in describing the loss

00:14:15.615 --> 00:14:19.026
of his sight.
When Adam falls in Book Nine of

00:14:19.026 --> 00:14:22.941
Paradise Lost -- and
these are the lines that are

00:14:22.941 --> 00:14:27.069
behind me on the board here --
we have a description of the

00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:30.984
almost physiological response of
the earth to the sinful

00:14:30.984 --> 00:14:34.258
transgression of Adam:
"Earth trembl'd from her

00:14:34.258 --> 00:14:37.607
entrails,
as again / in pangs,

00:14:37.607 --> 00:14:41.019
and Nature gave a second
groan."

00:14:41.019 --> 00:14:43.998
It's as if Milton has
transposed on to the entire

00:14:43.998 --> 00:14:47.783
earth the digestive pains that
were the consequence of his own

00:14:47.783 --> 00:14:50.931
noontime meal,
as if the flatulent earth were

00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:54.722
responding sympathetically
somehow to the violent shaking

00:14:54.722 --> 00:14:57.159
of Milton's own
entrails.Now,

00:14:57.159 --> 00:15:00.543
we're left at the point that
we're so often left:

00:15:00.543 --> 00:15:02.940
what's the point of all of
this?

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.754
What's at stake,
or what might be at stake,

00:15:06.754 --> 00:15:11.386
in this connection between
Milton's own postprandial

00:15:11.386 --> 00:15:15.564
groaning and moaning and the
even more poignant

00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:21.649
post-lapsarian groaning of Adam
and Eve and the entire earth?

00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:24.322
Now the connection between
these two phenomena,

00:15:24.322 --> 00:15:27.460
I believe (if there is one),
involves transgression.

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:31.310
The physical deterioration that
visits human beings after the

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.198
Fall comes as a direct
consequence, of course,

00:15:34.198 --> 00:15:36.830
of their transgression of
divine law.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:40.526
It's possible that we have
buried in this narrative of

00:15:40.526 --> 00:15:43.594
Milton's own physical
deterioration a related

00:15:43.594 --> 00:15:47.500
narrative of a kind of
transgression and punishment.

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.421
I assume that it has already
become clear to you that this

00:15:51.421 --> 00:15:55.412
will be one of those [laughs]
lectures that I'm giving over

00:15:55.412 --> 00:15:59.610
entirely to perfectly shameless
biographical speculation.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:01.679
It's one of the great joys,
and I take it to be one of the

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:04.059
great privileges,
of being able to lecture on

00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:07.500
Milton in this format rather
than in a seminar format,

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.774
because of course if this were
a seminar you could (and you

00:16:10.774 --> 00:16:13.090
would be right to) ask me for my
proof.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.029
How do I know what Milton
was thinking?

00:16:16.029 --> 00:16:19.755
And of course I have no proof
[laughter]

00:16:19.755 --> 00:16:24.404
but I know what I believe.
I'm willing here and now to

00:16:24.404 --> 00:16:28.499
share with you these things that
I believe actually quite

00:16:28.499 --> 00:16:31.557
passionately.
My own belief is that on some

00:16:31.557 --> 00:16:35.203
level Milton may not have
convinced himself when he wrote

00:16:35.203 --> 00:16:38.848
in the second defense -- or
Milton may not have convinced

00:16:38.848 --> 00:16:41.583
himself when he wrote in that
sonnet to Mr.

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:45.423
Cyriack Skinner -- that he had
willingly sacrificed his eyes

00:16:45.423 --> 00:16:49.069
for the good of his country or
that God had permitted his

00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:52.649
blindness as a sign of his
special election,

00:16:52.649 --> 00:16:54.929
covering his eyes with angel
wings.

00:16:54.929 --> 00:16:58.956
It's possible that what you
have in a letter like the letter

00:16:58.956 --> 00:17:03.187
to Leonard Philaras is something
like a submerged expression of

00:17:03.187 --> 00:17:05.077
guilt.
Maybe Milton's enemies were

00:17:05.077 --> 00:17:07.883
right;
maybe Milton was to blame with

00:17:07.883 --> 00:17:12.539
his transgressive challenges to
every conceivable form of

00:17:12.539 --> 00:17:15.993
authority.
Maybe Milton was to blame for

00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:19.676
his blindness,
the affliction that God visited

00:17:19.676 --> 00:17:22.950
upon him for his crimes.Now
this,

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:27.864
of course, is just one way to
understand the extraordinary

00:17:27.864 --> 00:17:33.123
attention that Milton gives to
his blindness in the invocation

00:17:33.123 --> 00:17:38.375
to Book Three of his epic.
Turn to page 257 in the

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:41.488
Hughes.
Milton continues in

00:17:41.488 --> 00:17:46.525
Paradise Lost -- this is
written well over a decade after

00:17:46.525 --> 00:17:51.641
the onset of blindness -- Milton
continues to defend himself from

00:17:51.641 --> 00:17:55.743
the imputation of blame.
The muse Milton invokes here is

00:17:55.743 --> 00:17:58.908
not the traditional muse of the
classic epic or even the

00:17:58.908 --> 00:18:02.419
heavenly muse that Milton seems
to have fashioned in the first

00:18:02.419 --> 00:18:06.056
invocation.
It's now exactly that power

00:18:06.056 --> 00:18:11.186
from which Milton has been
excluded by virtue of his

00:18:11.186 --> 00:18:15.210
blindness -- light:
"Hail holy Light,

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:19.900
offspring of Heav'n first-born,
/ Or of th' Eternal Coeternal

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:24.199
beam / May I express thee
unblam'd?"Let me just stop

00:18:24.199 --> 00:18:27.589
right there.
"May I express thee unblam'd?"

00:18:27.589 --> 00:18:31.726
Milton is exposing a fear at
the very beginning here of some

00:18:31.726 --> 00:18:35.500
imputation of blame or guilt.
He's not even sure how to

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.266
address this inspiring light.
The first seven lines of this

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:42.258
invocation are not just the most
--and they are,

00:18:42.258 --> 00:18:45.887
but they are not simply the
most impenetrable lines in the

00:18:45.887 --> 00:18:48.371
entire poem.
They are among the most

00:18:48.371 --> 00:18:50.809
difficult lines of poetry ever
written.

00:18:50.809 --> 00:18:53.788
It's always worth asking why a
passage of poetry is so

00:18:53.788 --> 00:18:55.980
impossible to wrap your brain
around.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.740
What's at stake here in this
difficulty?

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.886
Why this struggle,
and why must Milton struggle

00:19:01.886 --> 00:19:05.923
with such awkward metaphysical
categories in order simply to

00:19:05.923 --> 00:19:09.412
address properly the power of
light?I think it's

00:19:09.412 --> 00:19:13.175
understandable that Milton would
call the power of light

00:19:13.175 --> 00:19:15.980
"offspring of Heav'n
first-born."

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:19.577
According to Genesis,
light is the first thing that

00:19:19.577 --> 00:19:23.103
is created at the moment of
God's fiat lux:

00:19:23.103 --> 00:19:26.630
"let there be light," that
great commandment.

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:29.906
But the problem really arises
in line two when Milton

00:19:29.906 --> 00:19:33.434
conjectures that the beam of
light he's addressing wasn't

00:19:33.434 --> 00:19:37.059
born or wasn't begotten at all,
it wasn't created;

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:40.993
that it might actually be
co-eternal with the eternal

00:19:40.993 --> 00:19:43.154
Father himself.
This, I think,

00:19:43.154 --> 00:19:45.529
is a much more dangerous
possibility.

00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:49.390
Milton asks to be enlightened
by a light that might be as old

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.985
as the Father.
This runs utterly counter to

00:19:52.985 --> 00:19:58.154
the creation account in Genesis.
Could this light be one of the

00:19:58.154 --> 00:20:01.332
Father's rivals?
There's a fear here that the

00:20:01.332 --> 00:20:05.187
ambition of this bid for
paternal light is presumptuous,

00:20:05.187 --> 00:20:08.907
perhaps it's even satanic.
Satan of course in the next

00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:11.596
book, Book Four,
will have his invocation to

00:20:11.596 --> 00:20:14.347
light.Now,
the light Milton addresses has

00:20:14.347 --> 00:20:17.430
been around forever.
Look at line eight of this

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:22.619
opening invocation.
This is on the next page: 

00:20:22.619 --> 00:20:25.297
[B]efore the
sun,Before the Heavens thou

00:20:25.297 --> 00:20:27.210
wert, and at the voiceOf
God,

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:32.185
as with a Mantle,
didst investThe rising

00:20:32.185 --> 00:20:38.434
world of waters dark and
deep,Won from the void and

00:20:38.434 --> 00:20:42.855
formless infinite.
Thee I re-visit now with

00:20:42.855 --> 00:20:45.534
bolder wing,Escap't the
Stygian pool,

00:20:45.534 --> 00:20:48.950
though long detain'dIn that
obscure sojourn,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.356
while in my flightThrough
utter and through middle

00:20:52.356 --> 00:20:55.763
darkness borneWith other
notes than to th' Orphean

00:20:55.763 --> 00:20:58.720
LyreI sung of Chaos and
eternal Night,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.300
Taught by the heav'nly Muse
to venture downThe dark

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:07.055
descent, and up to reascend,
Though hard and

00:21:07.055 --> 00:21:10.989
rare…
Milton's giving us a picture of

00:21:10.989 --> 00:21:14.085
himself as proud.
Clearly, he's proud that he's

00:21:14.085 --> 00:21:17.485
returned from the descent into
hell that he seems to have made

00:21:17.485 --> 00:21:20.940
during the composition of the
first two books of his epics.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.055
He himself has escaped the
Stygian pool,

00:21:24.055 --> 00:21:27.250
and such a re-ascent is hard
and rare;

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.165
but we've just had represented
before this at the very end of

00:21:31.165 --> 00:21:33.450
Book Two, just lines before
this,

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.577
Satan's own escape from the
Stygian pool and Satan's own

00:21:37.577 --> 00:21:41.329
detainment in his obscure
sojourn through chaos.

00:21:41.329 --> 00:21:44.215
There's a remarkable
identification that Milton is

00:21:44.215 --> 00:21:47.513
bringing himself very close to:
an identification between

00:21:47.513 --> 00:21:51.034
Milton and Satan.
There lingers in this relation

00:21:51.034 --> 00:21:55.450
the idea that Milton has brought
upon himself some guilt,

00:21:55.450 --> 00:22:00.895
some blame perhaps,
for having sung of hell and

00:22:00.895 --> 00:22:05.750
having sung of chaos at
all.Milton,

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:08.705
of course, can't make this
connection explicit,

00:22:08.705 --> 00:22:10.890
but there lurks the
possibility,

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:14.392
and I grant you that it's an
irrational possibility,

00:22:14.392 --> 00:22:18.512
that Milton has done something
wrong -- I don't know how else

00:22:18.512 --> 00:22:22.907
to read these lines -- by flying
through utter and through middle

00:22:22.907 --> 00:22:26.753
darkness during his composition
of the first two books of

00:22:26.753 --> 00:22:31.195
Paradise Lost.
I know this doesn't make

00:22:31.195 --> 00:22:36.646
sense: it's almost as if
Milton's flight through darkness

00:22:36.646 --> 00:22:40.539
had been responsible for the
literal,

00:22:40.539 --> 00:22:43.095
visual darkness that is the
condition of his blindness,

00:22:43.095 --> 00:22:45.650
which he is describing now to
us for the first time.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:48.992
It's this possibility,
I think, the idea that Milton

00:22:48.992 --> 00:22:52.532
has brought his blindness on
himself over the course of

00:22:52.532 --> 00:22:55.220
[laughs]
the composition of the poem,

00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:59.273
which of course isn't the case
-- it's this possibility that,

00:22:59.273 --> 00:23:03.461
I think, accounts for the delay
in Milton's mention of his loss

00:23:03.461 --> 00:23:06.125
of sight,
the delay until this moment in

00:23:06.125 --> 00:23:08.342
the poem.
It's as if the guilt for his

00:23:08.342 --> 00:23:11.936
blindness in some impossible way
lay in the composition of this

00:23:11.936 --> 00:23:14.857
very poem,
as if the transgression that

00:23:14.857 --> 00:23:18.882
called down the wrath of the
heavenly Father had been

00:23:18.882 --> 00:23:22.829
Milton's glorious and heroic
treatment of Satan;

00:23:22.829 --> 00:23:26.796
as if it were Milton's
ambitious attempt to supply the

00:23:26.796 --> 00:23:30.089
angelic prehistory to the Book
of Genesis,

00:23:30.089 --> 00:23:33.193
to the creation account that we
get in the Book of Genesis,

00:23:33.193 --> 00:23:35.279
that had brought this wrath
upon him.

00:23:35.279 --> 00:23:40.014
Milton preempted,
he prevented,

00:23:40.014 --> 00:23:48.380
Genesis.He continues his
address to the light:

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:52.380
[T]hee I revisit
safe,And feel thy sovran

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:55.906
vital Lamp;
but thouRevisit'st not

00:23:55.906 --> 00:24:00.880
these eyes, that roll in
vainTo find thy piercing

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:04.562
ray,
and find no dawn;So thick a

00:24:04.562 --> 00:24:10.005
drop serene hath quench'd their
Orbs,Or dim suffusion

00:24:10.005 --> 00:24:13.186
veil'd.
Like so many [laughs]

00:24:13.186 --> 00:24:16.827
of the lines in this
invocation, these lines are

00:24:16.827 --> 00:24:21.010
violently crammed with an almost
unbearable pathos.

00:24:26.009 --> 00:24:30.775
"Thee I revisit safe" -- but
thou revisit'st not these eyes:

00:24:30.775 --> 00:24:35.540
it's impossible to read these
lines and not feel that Milton

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:39.660
is in some way accusing the
deity of injustice.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.999
It's as if Milton were
challenging the holy light to

00:24:42.999 --> 00:24:45.815
revisit Milton,
just as Milton is revisiting

00:24:45.815 --> 00:24:48.839
the holy light.
He structures this challenge --

00:24:48.839 --> 00:24:51.480
it's the logic of a quid pro
quo here.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:56.057
He's seeking compensation for
his loss but the compensation

00:24:56.057 --> 00:25:00.161
that he's looking for isn't
forthcoming.At least,

00:25:00.161 --> 00:25:03.925
it's not forthcoming yet.
Line thirty-two:

00:25:03.925 --> 00:25:09.456
"nor sometimes do I forget /
those other two equall'd with me

00:25:09.456 --> 00:25:15.079
in Fate, / so were I equalled
with them in renown…"

00:25:15.079 --> 00:25:18.852
Here he lists the famous blind
bards, the blind prophets of the

00:25:18.852 --> 00:25:22.159
Western tradition,
asking the muse of light to

00:25:22.159 --> 00:25:25.643
repay him for his fate,
the fate of blindness,

00:25:25.643 --> 00:25:29.513
with fame and renown:
the renown or fame enjoyed by

00:25:29.513 --> 00:25:33.770
blind Thamyris and blind
Maeonides -- Maeonides is Homer

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:38.214
-- and Tiresias and Phineus.
Milton knows perfectly well

00:25:38.214 --> 00:25:41.939
that each of these figures had
been blinded as some sort of

00:25:41.939 --> 00:25:44.887
punishment for a crime,
at least according to most of

00:25:44.887 --> 00:25:48.265
the legends surrounding them.
Each of these seers was thought

00:25:48.265 --> 00:25:51.383
to have been blinded for
aspiring to an intimate

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:55.641
knowledge of the godhead.
Even as Milton is asking God to

00:25:55.641 --> 00:25:59.902
elevate him to the status of
their equal and an equal to

00:25:59.902 --> 00:26:02.221
Homer,
sharing an equal renown and an

00:26:02.221 --> 00:26:05.249
equal fame, he's implicitly
acknowledging that terrifying

00:26:05.249 --> 00:26:08.295
possibility,
and it really is terrifying,

00:26:08.295 --> 00:26:10.770
that his blindness,
like theirs,

00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.804
is the result of his own
transgression:

00:26:13.804 --> 00:26:18.115
his punishment for trespassing
on divinity.But this

00:26:18.115 --> 00:26:21.903
acknowledgment -- if it is,
and I think it is -- this

00:26:21.903 --> 00:26:24.480
acknowledgment of guilt only
takes place between the lines,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.029
below the surface of the
invocation.

00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:32.961
For the most part Milton is
struggling to clear himself from

00:26:32.961 --> 00:26:38.618
any imputation of sin or crime.
From lines forty to fifty,

00:26:38.618 --> 00:26:43.524
the strategy of this invocation
shifts again,

00:26:43.524 --> 00:26:50.325
and Milton catalogs the losses
that he has endured through the

00:26:50.325 --> 00:26:56.292
loss of his sight.
When before had a poet

00:26:56.292 --> 00:27:03.869
represented himself in such
heartbreaking lines?

00:27:03.869 --> 00:27:07.672
Thus with the
YearSeasons return,

00:27:07.672 --> 00:27:12.923
but not to me returnsDay,
or the sweet approach of Ev'n

00:27:12.923 --> 00:27:16.920
or Morn,
Or sight of vernal bloom,

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:22.338
or Summer's Rose,Or flocks,
or herds, or human face

00:27:22.338 --> 00:27:26.784
divine;But cloud instead,
and ever-during

00:27:26.784 --> 00:27:30.569
darkSurrounds me,
from the cheerful ways of

00:27:30.569 --> 00:27:34.941
menCut off…
A few poets have been willing

00:27:34.941 --> 00:27:37.139
even [laughs]
-- well, after Milton,

00:27:37.139 --> 00:27:40.970
to subject themselves to this
kind of absolutely pathos-filled

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:45.532
self-representation.
For exposing himself in all of

00:27:45.532 --> 00:27:50.920
his vulnerability Milton has
everything to lose here,

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:54.494
and for exposing himself in all
of his vulnerability Milton asks

00:27:54.494 --> 00:27:58.885
for something in return.
He asks to be recompensed for

00:27:58.885 --> 00:28:02.434
these extraordinary losses.
I am [laughs]

00:28:02.434 --> 00:28:05.371
absolutely convinced that
there's a way in which this

00:28:05.371 --> 00:28:08.589
request is not irrational.
It's completely reasonable.

00:28:08.589 --> 00:28:11.259
Because he has bathed himself
in a pathos,

00:28:11.259 --> 00:28:14.039
I think, that's almost too
painful even to read,

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:16.230
we as readers are willing
[laughs]

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.851
to grant him anything he wants.
There's a kind of naked

00:28:19.851 --> 00:28:22.840
emotional logic governing our
experience of these

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.451
lines.Let's look at the
moment at which Milton asks for

00:28:26.451 --> 00:28:29.839
the payback.
This is line fifty-one:

00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:34.295
I have lost all these things,
in other words,

00:28:34.295 --> 00:28:40.269
"so much the rather thou
Celestial Light / shine inward,

00:28:40.269 --> 00:28:43.775
and the mind through all her
powers / irradiate,

00:28:43.775 --> 00:28:47.505
there plant eyes…"
Milton is demanding for his

00:28:47.505 --> 00:28:50.299
pains the inspiration of the
heavenly muse.

00:28:50.299 --> 00:28:54.144
God owes him this,
and so Milton is remarkably

00:28:54.144 --> 00:28:59.271
undoing the logic of sin and
punishment that he had inherited

00:28:59.271 --> 00:29:02.859
in his understanding of his
blindness,

00:29:02.859 --> 00:29:05.809
and he's restricting it as
something entirely different.

00:29:05.809 --> 00:29:11.040
He's turning it into a logic of
loss and compensation.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.860
Milton has sacrificed his sight.
He has lost almost everything,

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.969
and so much the rather lets God
repay him for that loss,

00:29:18.969 --> 00:29:22.480
what is once again his noble
self-sacrifice.

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.329
You have Milton reworking here
the rhetoric of guilt.

00:29:26.329 --> 00:29:29.899
His blindness becomes important
not because it's a sign of

00:29:29.899 --> 00:29:33.029
punishment or of blame or of
spot or of blemish,

00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:37.367
but it's a guarantee of the
inspirational success of the

00:29:37.367 --> 00:29:41.196
poem.
This is like a promissory note,

00:29:41.196 --> 00:29:45.952
his blindness is,
for his poetic reward -- the

00:29:45.952 --> 00:29:52.083
fact that this poem will have
been inspired by the heavenly

00:29:52.083 --> 00:29:54.680
muse.Oh,
this is wonderful.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:59.363
Turn to the very last page of
Hughes, of the Merritt Hughes

00:29:59.363 --> 00:30:02.269
edition. This is page
1044.

00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:05.601
This is one of the earliest
biographies of Milton written in

00:30:05.601 --> 00:30:08.304
the seventeenth century.
It's an anonymous one,

00:30:08.304 --> 00:30:11.839
and it gives us some remarkable
details about this man's life.

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:15.684
Some of them are so astonishing
there's no way they could have

00:30:15.684 --> 00:30:19.164
been made up.
The anonymous writer at the top

00:30:19.164 --> 00:30:23.824
of page 1044 is describing
Milton's daily habits as he was

00:30:23.824 --> 00:30:28.240
composing Paradise Lost
and the later poems.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:32.110
Milton, it seems,
would dictate the most recent

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.569
installment of Paradise Lost
in the morning.

00:30:36.569 --> 00:30:39.539
So this is what we learn:
"[H]e, waking early"-- and

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:42.509
you'll see this wonderful
admiration of the dear,

00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:45.772
Puritan Milton -- "waking
early, as is the use of

00:30:45.772 --> 00:30:48.627
temperate men,
had commonly a good stock of

00:30:48.627 --> 00:30:51.890
verses ready against his
amanuensis came..."

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:54.475
The amanuensis is the
secretary, the young man who

00:30:54.475 --> 00:30:57.747
would come to Milton's house --
and there were a number of them

00:30:57.747 --> 00:30:59.700
-- who would take down
dictation.

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:06.017
Milton seems to have composed
the poem at night in his sleep,

00:31:06.017 --> 00:31:10.440
which, the biographer
continues: "which,

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.918
if it happened to be later than
ordinary, [Milton]

00:31:13.918 --> 00:31:17.680
would complain [if the
amanuensis or the secretary got

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.236
there too late Milton would
complain]

00:31:20.236 --> 00:31:24.211
saying he wanted to be
milked."This absolutely

00:31:24.211 --> 00:31:26.980
[laughs]
stunning biographical detail is

00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:30.742
italicized here presumably
because it's a quotation --

00:31:30.742 --> 00:31:34.150
that's a form of noting a
quotation;

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.621
but the italics seem to me at
least to indicate as well that

00:31:37.621 --> 00:31:40.505
this is an extraordinary
privileged moment in this

00:31:40.505 --> 00:31:45.409
biographical text.
It's a scandalous little tidbit

00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:48.306
if it's true.
We have in here an

00:31:48.306 --> 00:31:52.666
extraordinary image of Milton's
understanding of his own poetic

00:31:52.666 --> 00:31:54.645
output,
and if this isn't true,

00:31:54.645 --> 00:31:57.640
what we do have here at the
very least is an incredibly

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.967
close and intimate reading of
this very invocation that we're

00:32:00.967 --> 00:32:04.166
focusing on.
Having filled himself up with a

00:32:04.166 --> 00:32:08.024
stock of verses the night
before, Milton could imagine

00:32:08.024 --> 00:32:12.319
himself as a source of spiritual
and poetic nourishment.

00:32:12.319 --> 00:32:16.621
Milton could imagine himself
the distinctly feminine source

00:32:16.621 --> 00:32:20.221
of this nourishing poem,
as if by a process of

00:32:20.221 --> 00:32:24.756
identification so complete
Milton could imagine himself in

00:32:24.756 --> 00:32:29.053
the role of the maternal muse
who feeds the poet as she

00:32:29.053 --> 00:32:33.509
inspires the thoughts that move
harmonious numbers.

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:36.977
It's not the muse only but the
poet, too, who can be

00:32:36.977 --> 00:32:40.376
milked.Now,
God the Father tells the Son --

00:32:40.376 --> 00:32:44.455
this is in the dialog between
the Father and the Son later in

00:32:44.455 --> 00:32:48.806
Book Three -- that at the end of
time there won't be a Father and

00:32:48.806 --> 00:32:52.069
a Son because God shall be "All
in All."

00:32:52.069 --> 00:32:55.961
A related form of a kind of
absolute internalization and

00:32:55.961 --> 00:32:59.004
absolute identification is at
work, I think,

00:32:59.004 --> 00:33:02.329
in this incredibly moving cry
to be milked.

00:33:02.329 --> 00:33:05.528
The muse has so completely
inspired the poet,

00:33:05.528 --> 00:33:08.799
so completely transferred her
power to him,

00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:14.001
that it's almost impossible to
tell who is who or who is

00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:17.606
feeding whom.
When Milton in the invocation

00:33:17.606 --> 00:33:20.471
requests that the muse,
the holy light,

00:33:20.471 --> 00:33:23.504
feed on thoughts,
we have a moment of confusion

00:33:23.504 --> 00:33:26.344
that would only seem to
guarantee that the transference

00:33:26.344 --> 00:33:28.289
of power has actually taken
place.

00:33:28.289 --> 00:33:31.453
It doesn't matter whether these
thoughts belong to the muse or

00:33:31.453 --> 00:33:34.365
to the poet.
These thoughts are "All in

00:33:34.365 --> 00:33:38.989
All."You have other
guarantees as well in Book Three

00:33:38.989 --> 00:33:43.360
of Milton's having filled up at
the fount of heavenly

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:48.626
inspiration,
and these moments of guarantee

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:52.974
[laughs]
come in in extraordinarily

00:33:52.974 --> 00:33:59.609
unexpected places.
Look at Book Three, line 576.

00:33:59.609 --> 00:34:02.140
In the Hughes Edition
this is page 272.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:05.212
On his way from hell to earth,
Satan stops at the sun,

00:34:05.212 --> 00:34:08.170
which is, of course,
the source of earthly light,

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.680
and Satan watches as the sun
dispenses light to all of the

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.909
little stars of heaven.
This is how Milton's astronomy

00:34:14.909 --> 00:34:16.652
works:
Where the great

00:34:16.652 --> 00:34:20.469
LuminaryAloof the vulgar
Constellations thick [of course,

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:23.726
the "great Luminary" is the
sun],That from his Lordly

00:34:23.726 --> 00:34:27.002
eye keeps distance due,
Dispenses Light from

00:34:27.002 --> 00:34:30.015
far…
Now, this "great Luminary," the

00:34:30.015 --> 00:34:32.510
sun, dispenses light to the
surrounding stars.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:36.124
With this image you have a
clearly demarcated model of a

00:34:36.124 --> 00:34:38.489
particular kind of power
relation.

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:44.528
This is the powerful sun's
unilateral inspiration of the

00:34:44.528 --> 00:34:48.810
stars.But look what happens
next.

00:34:48.810 --> 00:34:50.709
This is the stars: 
…

00:34:50.709 --> 00:34:54.595
[T]hey as they moveThir
Starry dance in numbers that

00:34:54.595 --> 00:34:57.280
computeDays,
months, and years,

00:34:57.280 --> 00:35:01.384
towards his all-chearing
LampTurn swift their various

00:35:01.384 --> 00:35:04.716
motions…
The stars are filling up here

00:35:04.716 --> 00:35:07.725
with the light of the sun and
they're behaving just as

00:35:07.725 --> 00:35:10.449
Milton's thoughts do when he's
been inspired,

00:35:10.449 --> 00:35:12.639
when they have been inspired by
holy light.

00:35:12.639 --> 00:35:16.512
They're filled with the
capacity of a kind of free will,

00:35:16.512 --> 00:35:19.539
and they turn themselves in
starry dance.

00:35:19.539 --> 00:35:23.123
Milton is very carefully
reworking in this passage,

00:35:23.123 --> 00:35:27.191
this astronomical passage,
the key words of the invocation

00:35:27.191 --> 00:35:30.449
that we've been looking at:
"move"and "numbers."

00:35:30.449 --> 00:35:34.711
He projects his image of the
inspired composition of the poem

00:35:34.711 --> 00:35:38.119
onto the enormous screen of the
entire cosmos.

00:35:38.119 --> 00:35:41.753
And, just as in the invocation,
the actual mover,

00:35:41.753 --> 00:35:46.219
the agent behind the action of
inspiration, is uncertain.

00:35:46.219 --> 00:35:51.498
They "turn swift their various
motions" or are turned by his

00:35:51.498 --> 00:35:55.834
magnetic beam.
We don't know who's turning

00:35:55.834 --> 00:35:58.651
what.
It's "All in All."It's at

00:35:58.651 --> 00:36:02.994
this moment of uncertain agency
that Milton really [laughs]

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:05.690
gives us something truly
amazing,

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:09.706
and I ask your indulgence here.
You will know that it's

00:36:09.706 --> 00:36:12.571
indisputable,
the point that I'm about to

00:36:12.571 --> 00:36:17.082
make, but I think it's shocking:
the sun warms the universe just

00:36:17.082 --> 00:36:20.090
as the holy light will warm the
poet.

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:23.634
That much, I think, is clear;
but Milton's figuration of this

00:36:23.634 --> 00:36:27.044
process, this process of
infusion, is truly one of the

00:36:27.044 --> 00:36:30.389
most surprising moments in the
poem for my money.

00:36:30.389 --> 00:36:35.403
This process of infusion
replicates on the grand scale --

00:36:35.403 --> 00:36:40.610
okay.
Well, let me read it first: 

00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:43.250
[That]
beam, that gently warmsThe

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:47.210
Universe, and to each inward
partWith gentle penetration,

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:52.381
though unseen,Shoots
invisible virtue even to the

00:36:52.381 --> 00:36:56.612
deep…
This process of infusion

00:36:56.612 --> 00:37:02.594
replicates on the grand scale of
the entire cosmos the rhythms of

00:37:02.594 --> 00:37:07.079
the intimate human act of coital
ejaculation.

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:09.550
You simply can't deny that
that's what's happening here.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:14.313
Milton may give us a cosmic
image of the process of

00:37:14.313 --> 00:37:19.840
inspiration but this is a
process by which the universe,

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:23.731
and by association the poet
himself, has been feminized and

00:37:23.731 --> 00:37:27.824
transformed mysteriously into
something like the maternal muse

00:37:27.824 --> 00:37:29.845
herself.
Milton tells us at the

00:37:29.845 --> 00:37:33.327
beginning of the invocation that
the light to which he prays was

00:37:33.327 --> 00:37:36.723
present at the creation.
Maybe that light was the same

00:37:36.723 --> 00:37:40.661
as that identifiable with the
heavenly spirit in Book One who

00:37:40.661 --> 00:37:43.813
"dove-like,
satst brooding on the vast

00:37:43.813 --> 00:37:46.820
Abyss / and mad'st it
pregnant..."

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:50.940
And maybe Milton here in Book
Three is imagining himself the

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.432
glorious recipient of this
remarkable act of divine

00:37:54.432 --> 00:37:57.891
impregnation.
He's no longer the vulnerable

00:37:57.891 --> 00:38:01.885
male poet whose poetic potency,
just like his sight,

00:38:01.885 --> 00:38:06.036
can be cut off at whim,
"from the cheerful ways of men

00:38:06.036 --> 00:38:11.650
/ cut off".
He's a body impregnated by God.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.452
The universe is a body
impregnated by God and perhaps

00:38:14.452 --> 00:38:17.039
even indistinguishable at some
point from God.

00:38:17.039 --> 00:38:21.135
He's a figure impervious to
punishment or pain.The

00:38:21.135 --> 00:38:25.926
psychic processes and strategies
that I've been describing here

00:38:25.926 --> 00:38:29.790
are clearly operating at the
level of fantasy.

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:33.550
This is wish fulfillment.
It's certainly not logic.

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:37.379
There's no moment in
Paradise Lost at which

00:38:37.379 --> 00:38:42.068
the poet will actually present a
logical statement concerning

00:38:42.068 --> 00:38:46.210
this wish to be absolutely
infused with divinity,

00:38:46.210 --> 00:38:50.427
to be so divine that he would
be invulnerable to punishment or

00:38:50.427 --> 00:38:54.575
to be so divine that he would be
invulnerable to the physical

00:38:54.575 --> 00:38:58.360
humiliation of blindness.
You don't have anything like an

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.750
explicit statement to that
effect in Paradise Lost,

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:05.136
but there is elsewhere in
Milton and I want to draw you to

00:39:05.136 --> 00:39:08.217
this now.
There is such an articulation

00:39:08.217 --> 00:39:10.889
in another poem.
This is what many scholars

00:39:10.889 --> 00:39:12.954
believe was the last poem that
Milton wrote,

00:39:12.954 --> 00:39:16.202
Samson Agonistes,
and so I'm going to ask you

00:39:16.202 --> 00:39:19.728
to turn to page 553 in the
Hughes to this passage in

00:39:19.728 --> 00:39:23.391
Samson Agonistes. Even
though we don't read the

00:39:23.391 --> 00:39:27.469
Samson Agonistes until
the end of the semester,

00:39:27.469 --> 00:39:31.522
I want to look at this small
section of it now since it

00:39:31.522 --> 00:39:36.251
engages the problem of blindness
with as much pathos and with as

00:39:36.251 --> 00:39:40.604
much force as anything that
Milton ever wrote.So Samson

00:39:40.604 --> 00:39:43.576
you know.
Samson is the biblical hero

00:39:43.576 --> 00:39:46.380
whose strength was bound up in
his hair.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.979
Samson was blinded by the
Philistines after his hair had

00:39:49.979 --> 00:39:52.990
been shorn by his treacherous
wife, Delilah.

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:57.599
Milton calls her "Dah-lee-lah."
Look at the Hughes.

00:39:57.599 --> 00:40:00.619
This is line eighty of
Samson.

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:04.934
Milton has his hero,
Samson, bewailing the fact of

00:40:04.934 --> 00:40:06.969
his blindness:
"O dark,

00:40:06.969 --> 00:40:11.830
dark, dark, amid the blaze of
noon, / irrecoverably dark,

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:16.691
total eclipse without all hope
of day!"At this point it's

00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:22.159
wonderful: Samson begins to echo
Milton from the invocation that

00:40:22.159 --> 00:40:26.127
we've been looking at,
the invocation to Book Three of

00:40:26.127 --> 00:40:27.840
Paradise Lost.
Here's Samson: 

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.106
O first created Beam,
and thou great Word,"Let

00:40:32.106 --> 00:40:35.674
there be light,
and light was over all";Why

00:40:35.674 --> 00:40:39.940
am I thus bereav'd thy prime
decree?The Sun to me is

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:44.775
darkAnd silent as the Moon,
When she deserts the

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:49.526
night,Hid in her vacant
interlunar cave.Since light

00:40:49.526 --> 00:40:53.949
[try to follow this logic]
so necessary is to life,

00:40:53.949 --> 00:40:57.940
And almost life itself,
if it be trueThat light is

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:02.420
in the Soul,She [the soul]
all in every part…

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:05.356
Samson's feeling his way here
toward Milton's theory of

00:41:05.356 --> 00:41:08.511
monism, the idea that the soul
is diffused throughout every

00:41:08.511 --> 00:41:12.228
part of the human body.
Since the light of the soul is

00:41:12.228 --> 00:41:15.750
diffused throughout every part
of the body, why,

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:19.301
Samson asks:
Why was the sightTo

00:41:19.301 --> 00:41:24.085
such a tender ball as th' eye
confin'd?So obvious and so

00:41:24.085 --> 00:41:28.596
easy to be quench't,
And not as feeling through

00:41:28.596 --> 00:41:34.154
all parts diffus'd,That she
might look at will through every

00:41:34.154 --> 00:41:36.093
pore?
These [laughs]

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:38.393
are extraordinary lines.
These are among my most

00:41:38.393 --> 00:41:41.813
favorite lines in all of Milton.
Samson is questioning the

00:41:41.813 --> 00:41:46.659
wisdom and the justice of God's
admittedly -- who can deny it?

00:41:46.659 --> 00:41:51.150
-- God's extremely peculiar
configuration of the human body.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:54.924
You read this and you realize
that Samson is really on to

00:41:54.924 --> 00:41:58.323
something here.
Why didn't, we ask with Samson,

00:41:58.323 --> 00:42:02.394
God implant the sense of sight
in human beings just as he

00:42:02.394 --> 00:42:05.519
implanted the sense of touch or
feeling?

00:42:05.519 --> 00:42:09.623
Why isn't sight like touch,
diffused through all parts of

00:42:09.623 --> 00:42:14.019
the body "that she might look at
will through every pore?"

00:42:14.019 --> 00:42:17.177
Milton's pushing here toward a
fantasy of physical

00:42:17.177 --> 00:42:19.947
invulnerability,
imagining an alternative --

00:42:19.947 --> 00:42:23.555
this is science fiction -- an
alternative model of bodily

00:42:23.555 --> 00:42:27.292
configuration that would render
impossible the all-too-easy

00:42:27.292 --> 00:42:30.707
quenching of the tender
eyeballs.In the context of

00:42:30.707 --> 00:42:34.245
Samson Agonistes,
in this particular speech

00:42:34.245 --> 00:42:37.790
of Samson's, we have to write it
off as a kind of morally suspect

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:39.760
complaint.
This is the faithless

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.500
questioning of the justice of
God's creation.

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:45.154
Milton doesn't permit himself
in Paradise Lost,

00:42:45.154 --> 00:42:49.429
at least not explicitly,
to impugn the wisdom behind

00:42:49.429 --> 00:42:54.630
God's creation of the
all-too-vulnerable human body,

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:59.059
but he does fashion for us
there a fantasy in Paradise

00:42:59.059 --> 00:43:01.901
Lost.
It's a lot like Samson's

00:43:01.901 --> 00:43:06.502
fantasy of a body exempt from
harm, free from disability,

00:43:06.502 --> 00:43:09.624
and that is,
of course, the body of the

00:43:09.624 --> 00:43:12.522
angels.
And so the last passage that

00:43:12.522 --> 00:43:16.551
I'm going to ask you to look at
is on page 331 of the Hughes

00:43:16.551 --> 00:43:19.010
edition. This is Book
Six,

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:25.170
line 344, and the narrator here
is the Archangel Raphael.

00:43:25.170 --> 00:43:29.014
Raphael's explaining to Adam
why the angels in the war in

00:43:29.014 --> 00:43:32.309
heaven can't be permanently
wounded or harmed.

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:35.505
Now we already know that angels
-- we've already learned this --

00:43:35.505 --> 00:43:38.699
that angels when they please can
"either sex assume" or both,

00:43:38.699 --> 00:43:41.281
but Raphael gives us even more
information about these

00:43:41.281 --> 00:43:44.380
perfectly fantastical figures.
Their bodies have been

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:48.159
constructed along precisely
those lines that Samson was

00:43:48.159 --> 00:43:50.795
proposing.
Their vital functions are

00:43:50.795 --> 00:43:54.384
diffused through every
part.So look at the bottom

00:43:54.384 --> 00:43:56.980
of the page.
This is line 344.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:44:01.222
[F]or Spirits that live
throughoutVital in every

00:44:01.222 --> 00:44:04.199
part, not as frail manIn
Entrails,

00:44:04.199 --> 00:44:06.333
Heart or Head,
Liver or Reins,

00:44:06.333 --> 00:44:10.967
[these angels]Cannot but by
annihilating die;Nor in thir

00:44:10.967 --> 00:44:14.130
liquid texture mortal
woundReceive,

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:20.596
no more can then the fluid
Air:All Heart they live,

00:44:20.596 --> 00:44:24.070
all Head, all Eye,
all Ear,

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:28.409
All Intellect,
all Sense…

00:44:28.409 --> 00:44:33.050
The body of each and every
angel has been created "All in

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:35.494
All."
No sensory power or important

00:44:35.494 --> 00:44:39.545
function has been confined to a
tender ball or a delicate orb or

00:44:39.545 --> 00:44:44.250
a particular organ.
These angels are all eye.

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.680
They have the power of sight
diffused throughout their entire

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.226
bodies, and we can only imagine
that they can -- just as Samson

00:44:51.226 --> 00:44:54.599
had fantasized -- that they can
see through every pore;

00:44:54.599 --> 00:44:57.956
and so the Miltonic angel
enjoys the state of absolute

00:44:57.956 --> 00:45:01.693
sight and absolute inspiration
and absolute oneness with God

00:45:01.693 --> 00:45:05.366
that Milton is bidding for on
some level in his complex and

00:45:05.366 --> 00:45:09.039
ambitious invocation to light in
Book Three.Now,

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:12.603
Milton isn't finished
articulating for us the

00:45:12.603 --> 00:45:16.409
impossible process of his poetic
inspiration,

00:45:16.409 --> 00:45:21.714
the miracle by which the blind
poet is compensated for his

00:45:21.714 --> 00:45:26.739
blindness with the vision of
things invisible to mortal

00:45:26.739 --> 00:45:29.181
sight.
Especially as we will see in

00:45:29.181 --> 00:45:31.286
the invocation,
or the quasi-invocation,

00:45:31.286 --> 00:45:33.500
to Book Seven of Paradise
Lost,

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.720
the poem will continue to voice
doubts that this process of

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:40.340
inspiration has actually
occurred;

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:46.907
but you have in the figure of
the Miltonic angel a literalized

00:45:46.907 --> 00:45:51.968
image, an embodiment,
of Milton's most ambitious

00:45:51.968 --> 00:45:56.574
fantasy for his poem.
It's an unrealistic fantasy for

00:45:56.574 --> 00:45:59.601
himself, of course,
but it is an ambitious fantasy

00:45:59.601 --> 00:46:02.320
and a genuine one,
I think, for his poem.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.616
We know that the body of the
poet, of course,

00:46:05.616 --> 00:46:09.513
would never undergo its much
desired, much fantasized

00:46:09.513 --> 00:46:12.809
metamorphosis into the body of
an angel.

00:46:12.809 --> 00:46:16.882
Milton's would never become a
body perfected,

00:46:16.882 --> 00:46:21.510
rendered impervious to
humiliation and darkness,

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:26.460
but the body of the angel may
in the end be an entirely

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:32.420
appropriate image for Milton's
fantasy of the body of the poem.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:38.996
It's this perhaps peculiar idea
that I'll leave you with today:

00:46:38.996 --> 00:46:44.936
we'll grant that Milton is
right, that he was inspired by

00:46:44.936 --> 00:46:48.715
God to write this poem.
If he is right,

00:46:48.715 --> 00:46:52.013
then the body of this epic
really is very much like the

00:46:52.013 --> 00:46:53.837
angelic body.
It is infused,

00:46:53.837 --> 00:46:56.805
and we have to believe it's
infused in every part,

00:46:56.805 --> 00:47:00.904
with the spirit of God.
It's nothing less than all

00:47:00.904 --> 00:47:04.982
heart, all intellect,
and -- and this is an

00:47:04.982 --> 00:47:09.448
extraordinarily resonant word
for Milton -- all

00:47:09.448 --> 00:47:12.889
sense.Okay.
That's the end of this lecture.

00:47:12.889 --> 00:47:16.948
Let me remind you that when you
read Book Three for next time,

00:47:16.948 --> 00:47:20.607
you will also look at the
passages from The Christian

00:47:20.607 --> 00:47:24.000
Doctrine that are assigned
on the syllabus.

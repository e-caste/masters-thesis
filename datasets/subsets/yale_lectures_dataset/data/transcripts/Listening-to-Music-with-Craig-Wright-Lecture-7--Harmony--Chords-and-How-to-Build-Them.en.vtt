00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.140
Prof: All right.
 

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:02.920
Let's get started.
 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:03.930
Here we go again.
 

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.750
Going to have some fun again
today.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.100
Notice, of course,
we have the sign-in sheet when

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.500
you come in every morning,
a great thing to do.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.319
As we say, this is not Yale's
most demanding class,

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.702
but one thing we do ask you to
do is come to the lectures and

00:00:16.702 --> 00:00:17.830
come to section.
 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.291
You may know if some day you
are in fact ill that you'll get

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:24.988
an e-mail message from me about
a half hour after class is over:

00:00:24.988 --> 00:00:28.450
"So sorry to hear that you
were sick this morning.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.660
Hope you're feeling better very
soon."

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.510
So we do look after these
things.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.446
Such an e-mail went out last
time, but I'm preaching to the

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:40.382
converted because you're--you
guys are already here so good

00:00:40.382 --> 00:00:40.990
for you.
 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.042
Let's continue with the
discussion of the elements of

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:46.820
music.
 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.660
We're going to be working today
with harmony.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.729
So far we've had two sessions
specifically on rhythm,

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.111
two sessions specifically on
melody, and today we come to

00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:58.050
harmony.
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.180
Harmony is one of the two
things that really distinguishes

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.878
the music of Western
civilization--Western classical

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:07.980
music, Western pop music.
 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.769
What are the two things?
 

00:01:08.769 --> 00:01:13.631
Well, as mentioned before,
this dependence upon heavy

00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:17.090
usage of written musical
notation--

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.444
not so much in the pop music
but certainly in the classical

00:01:19.444 --> 00:01:20.882
music--
writing it all down,

00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:23.349
being able to manipulate it in
that fashion,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.977
so that's one thing that
distinguishes Western classical

00:01:25.977 --> 00:01:26.360
music.
 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.680
Another aspect that we're
talking about today is harmony.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.688
Stop and think about it.
 

00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:33.250
Think about the melodies of
China and Japan,

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.580
virtually every--and Islamic
countries--

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.870
virtually every musical
civilization around the world

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.480
has more sophisticated melodies
than we do in the West.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.330
Ours are very blunt in a way.
 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.046
They go from one discrete
frequency to another discrete

00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:50.209
frequency to another discrete
frequency,

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.218
and they're not making use of
all of the material in between

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:56.190
in any sort of nuanced way.
 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.400
Maybe it's because we're so
dependent on the keyboard here.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.239
So that's important to keep in
mind.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.209
Then let's talk about rhythm
for a moment.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.658
Is Western rhythm particularly
sophisticated?

00:02:09.658 --> 00:02:13.038
I was listening as I was coming
in this morning--WMNR.

00:02:13.038 --> 00:02:15.816
They had a Strauss waltz
playing there,

00:02:15.816 --> 00:02:17.568
&gt;.
 

00:02:17.568 --> 00:02:19.520
How sophisticated is that
rhythmically?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.555
Think of African music where
you have one downbeat and one

00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:25.908
pattern working against another
downbeat and another pattern.

00:02:25.908 --> 00:02:28.139
Caribbean music--African
influence, the same kind of

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:28.490
thing.
 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.965
It's worlds ahead in terms of
sophistication with regard to

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:33.660
rhythm.
 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.266
But the one thing that's
distinguished Western music is

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:40.607
this idea of harmony,
this concept of superimposing

00:02:40.607 --> 00:02:42.008
multiple pitches.
 

00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:44.693
Interesting idea that you have
this sound &lt;&lt;plays

00:02:44.693 --> 00:02:45.440
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.199
, then you put another one with
it, &gt;

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:49.869
, then put another one with it,
another one,

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.669
&gt;
 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:54.313
, something like that,
and you can play with these and

00:02:54.313 --> 00:02:56.710
manipulate these in interesting
kinds of ways.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.008
So piling up sounds
simultaneously--

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:03.711
this idea of harmony--is what
makes Western music very

00:03:03.711 --> 00:03:05.891
special,
and what we end up with here--I

00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:07.758
just reached for anything in my
office--

00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:13.008
here is the overture to a score
of a Mozart opera.

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:15.598
And look here,
how many parts we have playing

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:16.598
simultaneously.
 

00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:20.615
Some of them may be repeating
pitch names so somebody may be

00:03:20.615 --> 00:03:23.813
playing a C here and somebody
else a C up there,

00:03:23.813 --> 00:03:25.378
that sort of thing.
 

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:27.378
They may be duplicating pitch
names,

00:03:27.378 --> 00:03:30.460
but you could have anywhere up
to ten--

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.535
well, in this case about
fifteen--different sounds going

00:03:33.535 --> 00:03:36.471
at once,
and you don't get that in other

00:03:36.471 --> 00:03:37.818
musical cultures.
 

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:40.210
Let's talk for a moment about
chords.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.889
What's a chord?
 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:46.477
Well, a chord is just a
simultaneous sounding of two or

00:03:46.477 --> 00:03:48.030
more pitches.
 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.580
And that's a very basic general
definition of a chord.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.292
And a chord can be,
of course, consonant

00:03:54.292 --> 00:03:56.310
&gt;
 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.680
or it can be &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.680
dissonant.
 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.219
So let's stick with
&gt;

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.520
just consonant chords.
 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.943
We'll be working with consonant
chords today and the most

00:04:06.943 --> 00:04:10.247
fundamental of the consonant
chords is this idea of the

00:04:10.247 --> 00:04:13.792
triad--
this figure that we call the

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:14.508
triad.
 

00:04:14.508 --> 00:04:18.519
It's the building block,
really, of all our harmonies,

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.939
whether it's pop or classical.
 

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:24.495
And we're going to use a lot of
pop music today and there'll

00:04:24.495 --> 00:04:28.050
be--we'll be pointing out triads
there in this pop music.

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.040
So what's a triad?
 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.939
Well, obviously you get the
idea of three pitches.

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.190
How does it work?
 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.949
Let's go over to the keyboard
and the staff here.

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.408
Let's say we've got a scale and
we do have a scale,

00:04:40.408 --> 00:04:42.000
&gt;
 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.497
C, D, E, F, G,
A, B, C, and I wanted to

00:04:45.497 --> 00:04:50.930
construct a triad above each of
these notes of the scale.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.766
Well, I take-- well,
this happens to be a C,

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:56.471
middle C here,
so a triad is going to have

00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:57.660
three pitches.
 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.677
You--and it spans five letter
names--and we go one letter

00:05:00.677 --> 00:05:02.939
name, two letter names,
three letter names,

00:05:02.939 --> 00:05:05.149
four letter names,
five letter names.

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:07.980
We take one, three, and five.
 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.586
Here I'm taking C,
skipping D, taking E,

00:05:10.586 --> 00:05:14.264
skipping F and taking G,
and it gives me this three-note

00:05:14.264 --> 00:05:15.199
aggregate.
 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.738
Take one, skip,
take one, skip,

00:05:17.738 --> 00:05:20.528
take one, &gt;
 

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:25.389
and we can do the same thing
&gt;

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:30.120
and so on right up the scale in
that fashion.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.536
Notice, as we've said before,
we've got the scale,

00:05:32.536 --> 00:05:35.149
we've got some notes rather
important in the scale.

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:37.250
Tonic is very important,
we've said, the--

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:38.430
&gt;
 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.100
the leading tone is important
so with chords and triads.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.889
Some are very important.
 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.694
The tonic is very important and
this dominant--what we call the

00:05:48.694 --> 00:05:49.370
dominant.
 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.750
It's not really the most
important.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.110
It sort of leads into,
pulls into--particularly

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.240
important setting up the tonic.
 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.160
It's the next important.
 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.850
Right below that is the
sub-dominant.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.718
It often pulls into the
dominant which then pulls into

00:06:08.718 --> 00:06:11.290
the tonic in that fashion.
 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:14.517
So we would get this idea of
here is a chord here,

00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:16.430
&gt;
 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.783
there is the tonic,
here is the dominant,

00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:20.490
&gt;
 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.269
there's the sub-dominant,
&gt;

00:06:22.269 --> 00:06:24.149
and there's the tonic.
 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:26.579
We can flip this just a little
bit.

00:06:26.579 --> 00:06:27.500
We can say, "All right.
 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.959
Here's our tonic up here"
&gt;

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:33.779
and go that way.
 

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:36.524
Tonic, sub-dominant,
dominant, tonic,

00:06:36.524 --> 00:06:38.279
&gt;
 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:43.089
&gt;
 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:44.089
that way.
 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:46.966
So we could go--come up from
the tonic or go down from the

00:06:46.966 --> 00:06:47.370
tonic.
 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.399
Generally speaking,
composers are more likely to go

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:53.851
down from the tonic and then
come back up to the tonic and

00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:56.759
then they aren't likely to go
the other way.

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:59.579
So we've got these three basic
chords that we're going to talk

00:06:59.579 --> 00:06:59.949
about.
 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:02.637
There are others there that
we've built on the second and

00:07:02.637 --> 00:07:05.228
the seventh degree of the scale,
but these are the most

00:07:05.228 --> 00:07:05.899
important.
 

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:12.101
And it's surprising how much
music these three basic chords

00:07:12.101 --> 00:07:17.661
can accommodate and all of the
things-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:19.480
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:26.386
dominant, tonic,
dominant, tonic,

00:07:26.386 --> 00:07:34.370
finally sub-dominant,
tonic, dominant,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.529
tonic.
 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:41.269
So a lot of music is made in
that fashion.

00:07:41.269 --> 00:07:44.351
One of my favorite pieces,
and I thought it was because

00:07:44.351 --> 00:07:47.947
it's a good teaching piece and I
thought it was known just to me

00:07:47.947 --> 00:07:50.887
and other old codgers,
is an old cowboy song called

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:53.831
"Streets of Laredo,"
but last night I looked it up

00:07:53.831 --> 00:07:55.387
on You--
not on YouTube,

00:07:55.387 --> 00:07:59.283
on iTunes, and there are one
hundred thirty-nine recordings

00:07:59.283 --> 00:08:02.341
of that that you can buy now--
Johnny Cash,

00:08:02.341 --> 00:08:04.800
Arlo Guthrie,
but I'm interested--

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.410
&gt;
 

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:10.838
anybody ever heard that before?
 

00:08:10.838 --> 00:08:12.129
Raise your hand if you've heard
that.

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:13.819
One, two, three--well,
a few people.

00:08:13.819 --> 00:08:15.120
So it's a cowboy song.
 

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.434
&gt;
 

00:08:15.434 --> 00:08:15.689
&gt;
 

00:08:15.689 --> 00:08:20.089
"As I walked out in the
streets of Laredo,

00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:27.588
as I walked out in Laredo one
day, I spied a cowpoke who was

00:08:27.588 --> 00:08:34.639
dressed in white linens,
dressed in white linens as cold

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.860
as the clay."
 

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.115
And as I was singing that all I
was doing underneath was playing

00:08:40.115 --> 00:08:42.490
the basic harmony,
the chords, and they consist

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:43.678
just of two chords.
 

00:08:43.678 --> 00:08:44.731
&gt;
 

00:08:44.731 --> 00:08:45.590
&gt;
 

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:52.142
As I--dominant,
tonic, dominant,

00:08:52.142 --> 00:08:59.538
tonic, dominant,
in that fashion.

00:08:59.538 --> 00:09:00.908
Why do chords have--why do we
do that?

00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:02.480
Why do we have to change these
chords?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.350
Any ideas?
 

00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.548
Why do we--why don't we just
say, &gt;

00:09:06.548 --> 00:09:07.009
&gt;
 

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:11.557
"As I walked out in the
streets of--"

00:09:11.557 --> 00:09:14.129
Why do we change chords?
 

00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:15.058
Yeah.
 

00:09:15.058 --> 00:09:16.970
Student: The melody
changes.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:21.720
Prof: The melody changes
&gt;

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.072
and because the melody changes
and you keep banging that same

00:09:25.072 --> 00:09:27.808
aggregate against it it's going
to create what?

00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:30.110
A dissonance and we don't
want--we don't like dissonances.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.278
If we're going to have
dissonances, we got to control

00:09:32.278 --> 00:09:32.570
them.
 

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:41.399
&gt;
 

00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:45.485
If--unless I change that chord
underneath when I get up here,

00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:47.460
&gt;
 

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.320
that's very dissonant.
 

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.160
It doesn't sound very silent
for "Silent Night"

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:56.003
there, so I need to switch to
another chord &lt;&lt;plays

00:09:56.003 --> 00:09:57.168
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:09:57.168 --> 00:09:58.970
and then switch back to the
original.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:04.889
And so we change chords to make
the harmony consonant or to make

00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:07.240
the harmony harmonious.
 

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.879
All right.
 

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:12.250
So that's something that we
need to keep in mind.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.692
Here's something else
that's--we're going to ask you

00:10:15.692 --> 00:10:19.340
to focus on and that is the rate
of harmonic change.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.259
We're really going to be asking
you two things.

00:10:21.259 --> 00:10:24.440
Is the harmony changing? Okay?
 

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:27.100
Can you--is the harmony
changing or is it static?

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.530
And if it is changing,
is it changing at a regular or

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:32.980
irregular rate?
 

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:36.072
By regular rate,
every time a chord sounds it

00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:39.870
will be holding for exactly the
same amount of time.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.649
Let's go back to "Streets
of Laredo."

00:10:41.649 --> 00:10:44.179
&gt;
 

00:10:44.179 --> 00:10:45.129
Conduct.
 

00:10:45.129 --> 00:10:52.004
--three, one,
two, three

00:10:52.004 --> 00:10:59.179
&gt;.
 

00:10:59.179 --> 00:10:59.870
What do you think?
 

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.809
Regular or irregular?
 

00:11:01.809 --> 00:11:03.389
Regular. Okay?
 

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:05.860
But no--well, okay.
 

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.940
So that's regular.
 

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.379
Let's go on to another one.
 

00:11:09.379 --> 00:11:14.179
&gt;
 

00:11:14.179 --> 00:11:14.960
Okay.
 

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.384
I'm doing a lot there in the
bass to make it more

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:18.293
interesting,
but let's strip that down just

00:11:18.293 --> 00:11:21.320
to the fundamental chord that's
underneath of that so we're--

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.360
_&gt;.
 

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.754
We're sitting here on the tonic
chord and we'll go

00:11:25.754 --> 00:11:26.879
&gt;
 

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:35.519
&gt;
 

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.019
, and we could even count it
out: &gt;

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:39.379
&gt;
 

00:11:39.379 --> 00:11:43.538
one-two, two-two,
three-two, four-two,

00:11:43.538 --> 00:11:47.360
one-two, one-two,
one-two, two-two,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:51.519
one-two, two-two,
three-two, four-two,

00:11:51.519 --> 00:11:56.240
one-two, two-two,
one-two, one-two.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.558
So some chords there are
holding for--

00:11:58.558 --> 00:12:02.572
I guess four measures--four
bars--and some for two and some

00:12:02.572 --> 00:12:06.072
for just one,
so that's an irregular rate of

00:12:06.072 --> 00:12:07.428
harmonic change.
 

00:12:07.428 --> 00:12:09.870
So we're not going to be asking
you is--

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.347
are we--"what chord do we
have here,"

00:12:12.347 --> 00:12:15.205
and expect you to say
sub-dominant or "what chord

00:12:15.205 --> 00:12:18.523
do we have you,"--
here and expect you to say

00:12:18.523 --> 00:12:19.240
dominant.
 

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.440
We're going to be working with
more fundamental things.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.278
Is the harmony changing?
 

00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:28.070
Is it changing at a regular or
irregular rate?

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:32.389
Okay.
 

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:36.830
Notice I was playing up here
&gt;

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:49.649
a little "Jingle
Bells."

00:12:49.649 --> 00:12:53.570
So what is it in music that
sets the harmony?

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:56.769
What part?
 

00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:59.019
Who--what's the foundation of
harmony?

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:01.600
What instrument plays it?
 

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.889
Where in the texture is it--are
we talking high,

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:05.870
low, middle?
 

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.409
Low.
 

00:13:06.409 --> 00:13:07.139
It's the bass.
 

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:09.320
The bass--it's like these
pillars.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.408
Think of architecture.
 

00:13:10.408 --> 00:13:13.465
You get-your--you put these
pilings in and then you can

00:13:13.465 --> 00:13:15.220
build other things around it.
 

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:17.028
Well, those basic notes:
&gt;

00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:18.587
the tonic note,
the dominant note,

00:13:18.587 --> 00:13:20.948
the sub-dominant note,
they're sort of the pilings,

00:13:20.948 --> 00:13:22.980
and you can ornament around the
piling.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:23.820
&gt;
 

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.519
That's just--I could
&gt;

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:27.019
in that fashion.
 

00:13:27.019 --> 00:13:28.291
That would be simple,
from dominant to tonic,

00:13:28.291 --> 00:13:29.129
&gt;
 

00:13:29.129 --> 00:13:30.418
or I could make it a little
more interesting.

00:13:30.418 --> 00:13:32.193
&gt;
 

00:13:32.193 --> 00:13:34.558
&gt;
 

00:13:34.558 --> 00:13:39.201
And that's kind of what bass
players do whether they're

00:13:39.201 --> 00:13:42.639
playing electric bass in a rock
band--

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:44.509
maybe in an even more
sophisticated way--

00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:49.900
an acoustic bass in a symphony
or a double bass in a bluegrass

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.519
band.
 

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:57.058
And who is the world's most
famous double bass player in a

00:13:57.058 --> 00:13:59.009
bluegrass band?
 

00:13:59.009 --> 00:14:00.460
Anybody know?
 

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:01.500
Well, think here at Yale.
 

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:02.549
Well, we'll see.
 

00:14:02.549 --> 00:14:08.226
Now what we've got here--let--
This is one that this world

00:14:08.226 --> 00:14:10.918
famous bass player was kind
enough to loan me.

00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:17.514
It was something put together
by Kentucky Public Television so

00:14:17.514 --> 00:14:20.649
let's bring up this screen.
 

00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:23.730
So here's the setup.
 

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:28.695
We've got a DVD from Kentucky
Public Television involving,

00:14:28.695 --> 00:14:32.267
as you will see,
some people that may look

00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:33.399
familiar.
 

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:34.529
Does this person look familiar?
 

00:14:34.529 --> 00:14:36.240
Does anybody know this person?
 

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.070
She's a student around here.
 

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.456
She was a Yale undergraduate
and she's telling us how she

00:14:40.456 --> 00:14:43.663
tried out for the Yale Symphony
Orchestra, and she was

00:14:43.663 --> 00:14:45.538
designated as an alternate.
 

00:14:45.538 --> 00:14:48.708
And she was crestfallen,
but she then saw this ad where

00:14:48.708 --> 00:14:51.820
some people wanted her to play
in a bluegrass band.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.429
So let's watch what happens.
 

00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:55.798
&gt;
 

00:14:55.798 --> 00:14:57.850
"--trapped in a classical
violinist's body,

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.070
so I guess they were kind of
pessimistic about my playing--

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:01.860
you know, they wanted real
fiddle player,

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.320
so she was like 'You're from
West Virginia.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.830
You should go on down there and
audition for that!'

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:09.643
And so luckily,
no other fiddle players showed

00:15:09.643 --> 00:15:12.519
up, they were like
&gt;

00:15:12.519 --> 00:15:13.950
Mozart?
 

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:18.798
--So they were very kind to let
me kind of,

00:15:18.798 --> 00:15:22.005
you know, get my training on
the job and so I started playing

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:24.783
with them at that point and it's
just been great ever

00:15:24.783 --> 00:15:25.639
since."
 

00:15:25.639 --> 00:16:24.460
&gt;
 

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.840
Okay.
 

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:32.230
So our mystery bass player is
Peter Salovey,

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.070
the new provost.
 

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.972
And I sent him an e-mail--I
said, "Peter,

00:16:35.972 --> 00:16:36.269
look.
 

00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:37.340
We're teaching bass over here.
 

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.783
Why don't you come in and bring
your bass in and you can

00:16:39.783 --> 00:16:41.158
demonstrate this stuff."
 

00:16:41.158 --> 00:16:43.070
"Oh, I'm a little bit busy
&gt;

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.899
at the moment but I got this
DVD.

00:16:45.899 --> 00:16:48.639
You can have this DVD and do
whatever you want to it."

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:50.809
So what's he doing there?
 

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:53.610
&gt;
 

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:56.649
And he's working around these
&gt;

00:16:56.649 --> 00:16:58.970
particular notes in this
particular piece.

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:03.190
We're going to say here is a C,
&gt;

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:05.509
there's the subdominant,
&gt;

00:17:05.509 --> 00:17:09.390
then it goes
&gt;

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:21.140
and oftentimes he's going
&gt;.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.573
But again it's just fleshing
out that subdominant chord,

00:17:24.573 --> 00:17:28.317
dominant chord and tonic chord,
and it's--and we can all hear

00:17:28.317 --> 00:17:28.880
this.
 

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.019
Do we see--is this guy playing
off the music?

00:17:32.019 --> 00:17:35.220
Again, get across the
point--not using music.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:36.200
How are they doing this?
 

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.640
They're hearing the chords.
 

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.402
They're hearing tonic,
subdominant and dominant,

00:17:40.402 --> 00:17:42.460
and I think we can hear them
too.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.799
Anybody out there hearing these
chords?

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:46.160
Can you sing along with these?
 

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:48.240
This is wonderful music.
 

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.390
It's great.
 

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.630
I--how many like this music?
 

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:51.769
It's happy music, again.
 

00:17:51.769 --> 00:17:54.578
Is it--we should have a whole
course on bluegrass music.

00:17:54.578 --> 00:17:58.167
It could really be good 'cause
a lot of interesting ethnic

00:17:58.167 --> 00:17:59.680
issues involved there.
 

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.364
So let's continue here--and
I'll sort of bang on the

00:18:02.364 --> 00:18:04.680
piano--sing the basic pitches of
the bass.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.250
And I hope you'll join with me
here.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.211
If you don't like bluegrass,
you don't have to sing but if

00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:11.549
you like bluegrass sing along
with me here.

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.990
Okay.
 

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:13.099
Here we go.
 

00:18:13.099 --> 00:18:23.640
&gt;
 

00:18:23.640 --> 00:19:06.038
&gt;
 

00:19:06.038 --> 00:19:08.195
Now I think this is Craig
Harwood, who actually went

00:19:08.195 --> 00:19:08.913
through our Ph.D.
 

00:19:08.913 --> 00:19:09.380
program.
 

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.609
He's the dean of one of the
colleges around here.

00:19:11.609 --> 00:19:13.309
What college?
 

00:19:13.309 --> 00:19:15.029
What?
 

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:16.019
Davenport.
 

00:19:16.019 --> 00:19:18.470
So he's very good--playing the
mandolin here.

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:20.769
He also runs a Klezmer Band.
 

00:19:20.769 --> 00:19:22.569
&gt;
 

00:19:22.569 --> 00:19:38.119
&gt;.
 

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:38.720
I don't know.
 

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:41.140
Is this too goofy--or stay with
this &gt;

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.068
or ditch this?
 

00:19:43.068 --> 00:19:46.559
I think it's wonderful but you
seem less excited by it than I.

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:52.578
All right.
 

00:19:52.578 --> 00:19:54.838
Let's talk about how these
basses--

00:19:54.838 --> 00:19:57.498
we said that the bass note is
sort of the foundation and then

00:19:57.498 --> 00:19:59.358
you add these other things up
above it,

00:19:59.358 --> 00:20:01.807
and they produce these chords
and the chords are tonic and

00:20:01.807 --> 00:20:02.710
dominant and so on.
 

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.288
Sometimes if you're have a solo
instrument the--you can play the

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:09.130
bass as just a chord
&gt;

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:10.848
or you could play it
&gt;

00:20:10.848 --> 00:20:14.250
--the same notes but spinning
them out.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:16.964
And we call that an
arpeggio--probably 'cause the

00:20:16.964 --> 00:20:19.285
harps play this a lot,
a sort of arpeggio,

00:20:19.285 --> 00:20:21.038
&gt;
 

00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:24.244
--taking the notes of the triad
and just spinning them out in

00:20:24.244 --> 00:20:24.940
succession.
 

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:29.035
And arpeggios work particularly
well with--on triads with pieces

00:20:29.035 --> 00:20:30.920
that happen to be in three.
 

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:31.317
&gt;
 

00:20:31.317 --> 00:20:31.848
&gt;
 

00:20:31.848 --> 00:20:35.827
"As I walked out in the
streets of Laredo,"

00:20:35.827 --> 00:20:38.660
--one, two, three,
one, two, three.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.736
So that's an arpeggio--just a
chord with the notes played

00:20:42.736 --> 00:20:45.430
successively to create an
arpeggio.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:50.009
It works less well--these
triadic arpeggios--with pieces

00:20:50.009 --> 00:20:50.759
in two.
 

00:20:50.759 --> 00:20:57.460
&gt;
 

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.369
That's not so good.
 

00:20:58.369 --> 00:20:59.029
Right?
 

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:04.160
&gt;
 

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.470
Kind of a metrical train wreck
there.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:09.490
So what we would do with that
would be to find another

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:10.058
pattern.
 

00:21:10.058 --> 00:21:12.692
And one of the favorite
patterns ever since the

00:21:12.692 --> 00:21:16.068
eighteenth century was this
thing called an Alberti bass.

00:21:16.068 --> 00:21:17.019
It goes &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:21:17.019 --> 00:21:20.961
one, then up to the fifth note,
degree of the triad--one,

00:21:20.961 --> 00:21:22.932
five, three,
five, one, five,

00:21:22.932 --> 00:21:24.059
three, five.
 

00:21:24.059 --> 00:21:30.750
&gt;
 

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:32.150
And it sounds very classical.
 

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:36.366
But that's a good way of
harmonizing something--making

00:21:36.366 --> 00:21:40.105
something that's not very
interesting sound more

00:21:40.105 --> 00:21:41.380
interesting.
 

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:45.635
Another way of doing it is just
taking a note,

00:21:45.635 --> 00:21:48.380
&gt;
 

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.709
kind of a boogie-woogie
bass--if you just take octaves

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:51.720
and roll it that way.
 

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:58.965
Beethoven does this in the
sonata &lt;&lt;plays

00:21:58.965 --> 00:22:01.329
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:22:01.329 --> 00:22:01.828
and so on.
 

00:22:01.828 --> 00:22:04.636
So there you can get the
harmony to sound more

00:22:04.636 --> 00:22:08.068
interesting simply by rolling
that octave underneath.

00:22:08.068 --> 00:22:13.101
So all of these little tricks
sort of energize the music,

00:22:13.101 --> 00:22:17.863
and, again, make it more
interesting than it otherwise

00:22:17.863 --> 00:22:19.750
perhaps would be.
 

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:24.088
Sometimes harmonies can stand
by themselves.

00:22:24.088 --> 00:22:27.464
Sometimes you could take just
the harmony and it would be very

00:22:27.464 --> 00:22:28.130
beautiful.
 

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:33.779
J.S.***Bach--
J.S. Bach wrote a prelude to

00:22:33.779 --> 00:22:36.307
the first book of his
"Well-Tempered

00:22:36.307 --> 00:22:37.509
Clavier."
 

00:22:37.509 --> 00:22:40.259
And it's a famous work.
 

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:52.329
It goes this way &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:53.250
and so on.
 

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:59.230
All it really is is
&gt;

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.598
a succession of chords played
as arpeggios.

00:23:02.598 --> 00:23:05.701
So there it sat for
about--well, I would--could say

00:23:05.701 --> 00:23:09.548
rather specifically about one
hundred and forty years or so.

00:23:09.548 --> 00:23:12.150
And the French composer in the
nineteenth century,

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.210
Charles Gounod,
came along and said,

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:17.070
"Well, gee, that's nice,
but I could write a melody

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.848
against that."
 

00:23:17.848 --> 00:23:21.317
So we're going to listen to
this--listen to Bach's harmony

00:23:21.317 --> 00:23:22.108
underneath.
 

00:23:22.108 --> 00:23:27.813
At the same time we listen to
this lovely melody that Charles

00:23:27.813 --> 00:23:30.190
Gounod composed for it.
 

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.424
And it gives a chance to think
about melody and it gives us a

00:23:33.424 --> 00:23:35.960
chance to think about the sound
of the cello.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.848
The cello is a particularly
beautiful instrument.

00:23:38.848 --> 00:23:42.164
I've always said if I ever come
back as a musical instrument I

00:23:42.164 --> 00:23:43.848
want to come back as a cello.
 

00:23:43.848 --> 00:23:47.009
And it's just so rich and so
beautiful and it can soar.

00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:51.212
So let's listen to a lovely
cello line added over top of

00:23:51.212 --> 00:23:53.200
Bach's original harmony.
 

00:23:53.200 --> 00:24:46.440
&gt;
 

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.970
Descending sequence.
 

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.980
Here the pattern shows up again
but at a lower step.

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.470
&gt;
 

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:58.288
Now it sounds as if he's going
to do it yet a third time,

00:24:58.288 --> 00:25:03.279
but this time he takes that
melody and moves up with it.

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:14.150
&gt;
 

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.930
Now the rest of this,
he's arching for a high moment

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.710
and we'll get to that.
 

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:22.089
It's building higher and higher.
 

00:25:22.089 --> 00:26:25.009
&gt;
 

00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:28.501
It comes back to the tonic
after that lovely climax at the

00:26:28.501 --> 00:26:29.358
top of that.
 

00:26:29.358 --> 00:26:34.587
So we need to point out that
we've got these two types of

00:26:34.587 --> 00:26:40.190
chords here, the idea of the--
&gt;

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:43.720
This was all in C major but we
could turn this into C minor.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.480
Let's go back and review this.
 

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:50.279
We have up on the board again
the scale.

00:26:50.279 --> 00:26:54.075
And we need to talk about these
triads that are made up of

00:26:54.075 --> 00:26:56.140
either major or minor thirds.
 

00:26:56.140 --> 00:26:58.984
Here we could look at this way
with this particular interval

00:26:58.984 --> 00:27:00.480
and this particular interval.
 

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.634
Let's go over to the keyboard
here 'cause I think it's easier

00:27:04.634 --> 00:27:08.789
to show here so we're going to
start here with C because C is

00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:10.730
kind of revenue neutral.
 

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:15.041
We'll start here with C and
we're going to take--skip one,

00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:18.068
take one, skip one,
take one, so we do C,

00:27:18.068 --> 00:27:18.750
E, G.
 

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.193
Notice coming up here,
we have one,

00:27:21.193 --> 00:27:23.710
two, three, four half steps
here.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:24.880
This is an interval.
 

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.990
This interval from C up to E is
the interval of a third because

00:27:28.990 --> 00:27:30.980
it spans three letter names.
 

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:32.809
C up to G is a fifth.
 

00:27:32.809 --> 00:27:35.650
It spans five letter names.
 

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:39.344
So we have C,
D, E being a third with one,

00:27:39.344 --> 00:27:43.220
two, three, four steps in
it--half steps.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.808
Now we're going to go from E up
to G.

00:27:45.808 --> 00:27:49.078
Notice here we get one,
two, three--just three.

00:27:49.078 --> 00:27:50.980
And that's because,
as I said before,

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:54.982
we've got this arbitrary
division of the octave according

00:27:54.982 --> 00:27:59.057
to Greek mathematics onto which
in the ninth and tenth and

00:27:59.057 --> 00:28:03.346
eleventh century the Benedictine
monks laid on another system

00:28:03.346 --> 00:28:05.420
that didn't quite work.
 

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.318
So up here this all seems to be
the same distance.

00:28:08.318 --> 00:28:12.599
E to F seems to be the same
distance as D to E but it's not.

00:28:12.599 --> 00:28:13.710
It's only half the distance.
 

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:17.400
So we get this funny
disjunction in the keyboard

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:17.950
here.
 

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:21.482
But in any event,
the important thing to note is

00:28:21.482 --> 00:28:26.144
that we have a major triad with
the big third on the bottom and

00:28:26.144 --> 00:28:28.548
the little third on the top.
 

00:28:28.548 --> 00:28:31.000
If we switched this around now
and went to C,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.390
E-flat, G to give us the minor
triad,

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:40.029
then, of course,
we would have just three half

00:28:40.029 --> 00:28:43.026
steps here and four here.--
or reciprocal angles or

00:28:43.026 --> 00:28:44.210
something like that.
 

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.970
You change one--ipso
facto, you change the other.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:49.663
But that's all of this in play
and we've seen this in play

00:28:49.663 --> 00:28:50.088
before.
 

00:28:50.088 --> 00:28:53.318
Just the positioning of that
third will determine whether

00:28:53.318 --> 00:28:56.029
this triad is a major triad or a
minor triad.

00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:58.490
Let's see how this works out in
terms of real sound.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:29:01.990
I'd like for you guys down
here-- &gt;

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.299
Just hold that pitch.
 

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:06.319
&gt;
 

00:29:06.319 --> 00:29:08.440
And TAs, can you sing the fifth?
 

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.338
&gt;
 

00:29:10.338 --> 00:29:12.794
And nice and loud,
everybody, and everyone else--

00:29:12.794 --> 00:29:13.970
&gt;
 

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:15.220
There is the major third.
 

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:15.950
Work with me.
 

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:17.099
Everybody else sing that third.
 

00:29:17.099 --> 00:29:19.500
&gt;
 

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:20.619
Now we're going to go minor.
 

00:29:20.619 --> 00:29:23.559
&gt;
 

00:29:23.559 --> 00:29:31.970
Major, minor, major, okay.
 

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:36.368
And it's just tweaking that
middle note of the triad there.

00:29:36.368 --> 00:29:37.779
That's all that's really
involved.

00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:39.240
And composers have tweaked this.
 

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.140
Here's a piece by Franz Liszt.
 

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.680
It was re-orchestrated by a
contemporary composer,

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.625
called "Lugubrious
Gondola"

00:29:45.625 --> 00:29:47.272
in French--
or in English,

00:29:47.272 --> 00:29:49.160
translated from the French.
 

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.700
Let's listen to a bit of it.
 

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.348
It starts out with a woodwind
instrument.

00:29:53.348 --> 00:29:55.670
What woodwind instrument is
playing here?

00:29:55.670 --> 00:30:00.157
And then we'll focus on the
change from one triad to the

00:30:00.157 --> 00:30:00.730
next.
 

00:30:00.730 --> 00:30:16.039
&gt;
 

00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:17.660
So what instrument was that?
 

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:18.598
Did you pick that up?
 

00:30:18.598 --> 00:30:21.108
Now everybody--yeah,
it was a clarinet.

00:30:21.108 --> 00:30:23.390
Now if we were doing this on a
quiz or a test,

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:25.531
we'd probably play that three
times so that you'd hear it a

00:30:25.531 --> 00:30:27.838
lot more than just that,
but it was a clarinet.

00:30:27.838 --> 00:30:31.720
Now we go to this sound
&gt;

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.710
and watch what happens.
 

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:45.880
&gt;
 

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:49.180
Moves to another chord,
&gt;

00:30:49.180 --> 00:31:05.352
--minor, major,
minor, major,

00:31:05.352 --> 00:31:18.058
minor, major,
minor.

00:31:18.058 --> 00:31:22.002
Let's pause it there and reset
that just a little bit,

00:31:22.002 --> 00:31:25.650
because underneath,
what's the bass doing here?

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:33.779
&gt;
 

00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:35.410
What's that?
 

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.118
Arpeggio.
 

00:31:36.118 --> 00:31:37.660
Yeah, just an arpeggio
underneath.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.419
So sometimes we take these
chords and we'll just use it as

00:31:40.419 --> 00:31:41.630
an arpeggio to support.
 

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:50.019
&gt;
 

00:31:50.019 --> 00:31:51.029
Remember last time?
 

00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:53.861
That's all Puccini does-- by
way of a harmonic support there,

00:31:53.861 --> 00:31:56.740
just takes that tonic chord and
&gt;

00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:01.700
basically just works that out
as an arpeggio underneath.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:02.730
All right.
 

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.344
So let's see how--if we can
begin to hear the distinction

00:32:06.344 --> 00:32:09.118
between a major triad and a
minor triad,

00:32:09.118 --> 00:32:12.130
and for this we're going to
turn to a very famous piece--

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:15.108
the "Moonlight
Sonata" of Beethoven,

00:32:15.108 --> 00:32:18.460
and I ask you--if you got a
piece of paper there--

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:23.262
I hope you do--we're going to
play nineteen chords for you and

00:32:23.262 --> 00:32:27.910
we're going to ask you which is
major and which is minor.

00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:30.259
So, you know the piece.
 

00:32:30.259 --> 00:33:03.368
&gt;
 

00:33:03.368 --> 00:33:06.125
So I'm going to sort of strip
these down to their essence

00:33:06.125 --> 00:33:06.470
here.
 

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:10.390
Here's chord number one:
major triad or minor triad?

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.329
&gt;
 

00:33:13.329 --> 00:33:15.390
Here's chord number two.
 

00:33:15.390 --> 00:33:23.278
&gt;
 

00:33:23.278 --> 00:33:26.618
Here's three,
&gt;

00:33:26.618 --> 00:33:31.829
four, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:33:31.829 --> 00:33:32.970
five.
 

00:33:32.970 --> 00:33:34.789
&gt;
 

00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:37.353
Here's six, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:33:37.353 --> 00:33:37.960
seven.
 

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.880
&gt;
 

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.640
Here comes eight.
 

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.690
&gt;
 

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.769
Here's nine,
&gt;

00:33:47.769 --> 00:33:51.019
ten, &gt;
 

00:33:51.019 --> 00:33:51.566
eleven.
 

00:33:51.566 --> 00:33:53.750
&gt;
 

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:57.660
Here's twelve,
&gt;

00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.838
thirteen, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:03.450
fourteen, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:05.740
fifteen, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:09.960
sixteen, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.257
seventeen.
 

00:34:11.257 --> 00:34:14.889
&gt;
 

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:18.690
Here's eighteen &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.869
and nineteen &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:23.684
That's nineteen.
 

00:34:23.684 --> 00:34:26.860
&gt;
 

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:27.489
So how did you do?
 

00:34:27.489 --> 00:34:28.440
Well, let's see here.
 

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.440
Let's go back and double check
this.

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:31.719
&gt;
 

00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:33.230
Now that's a minor chord.
 

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:34.590
I'll just tell you the answers
here.

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:35.389
&gt;
 

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:36.989
That's major.
 

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:37.865
This is minor.
 

00:34:37.865 --> 00:34:39.619
&gt;
 

00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:40.603
Three is minor.
 

00:34:40.603 --> 00:34:42.440
&gt;
 

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:43.295
Four is minor.
 

00:34:43.295 --> 00:34:45.010
&gt;
 

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:45.659
What about that one?
 

00:34:45.659 --> 00:34:46.628
That may be a tough one.
 

00:34:46.628 --> 00:34:47.760
&gt;
 

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.139
Is that a major chord or a
minor chord?

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:50.409
Major.
 

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:51.670
&gt;
 

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:53.597
Some of these are hard,
though.

00:34:53.597 --> 00:34:55.460
&gt;
 

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.239
Major or minor?
 

00:34:57.239 --> 00:34:57.661
Major.
 

00:34:57.661 --> 00:34:59.630
&gt;
 

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.579
Okay. That was six.
 

00:35:00.579 --> 00:35:01.099
Here's seven.
 

00:35:01.099 --> 00:35:02.219
&gt;
 

00:35:02.219 --> 00:35:03.159
Excuse me.
 

00:35:03.159 --> 00:35:04.998
Seven is &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:04.998 --> 00:35:05.420
major.
 

00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.364
Eight is &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:07.364 --> 00:35:07.809
minor.
 

00:35:07.809 --> 00:35:09.396
Nine is &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:09.396 --> 00:35:09.768
major.
 

00:35:09.768 --> 00:35:10.469
Ten is major.
 

00:35:10.469 --> 00:35:11.980
&gt;
 

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.000
Eleven is &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:14.449
minor.
 

00:35:14.449 --> 00:35:15.675
Twelve is major.
 

00:35:15.675 --> 00:35:17.820
&gt;
 

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.041
Thirteen is &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:20.041 --> 00:35:20.510
minor.
 

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.190
Fourteen, minor.
 

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:22.380
&gt;
 

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:23.000
Fifteen, minor.
 

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.159
&gt;
 

00:35:24.159 --> 00:35:25.362
Sixteen, minor.
 

00:35:25.362 --> 00:35:27.610
&gt;
 

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.856
Seventeen, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:30.856 --> 00:35:31.559
major.
 

00:35:31.559 --> 00:35:33.784
Eighteen, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:33.784 --> 00:35:34.280
minor.
 

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:39.090
Nineteen, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:40.159
major.
 

00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:42.300
So we'll be working--this I
think is fair game,

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.280
just to differentiate between a
major triad and a minor triad.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:50.452
And we'll be doing that on the
test a week from now but we'll

00:35:50.452 --> 00:35:55.800
be giving you lots of prepping
in that in section this week.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.260
Let's return to the pop realm
and focus continually here on

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.782
harmony and combine the idea of
harmony with major and minor

00:36:02.782 --> 00:36:03.380
triad.
 

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:07.179
I'm going to play a piece that
I've always liked by U2.

00:36:07.179 --> 00:36:10.246
I don't really know much about
them but it's an interesting

00:36:10.246 --> 00:36:12.309
piece, "Love is
Blindness."

00:36:12.309 --> 00:36:17.226
Let's listen to chunks of this
and we'll see what they're doing

00:36:17.226 --> 00:36:19.130
with the harmony here.
 

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:32.909
&gt;
 

00:36:32.909 --> 00:36:34.110
What's the meter?
 

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:40.909
Kind of a slow what?
 

00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:41.202
Okay.
 

00:36:41.202 --> 00:36:44.670
So for copyright reasons we're
cutting this exactly short.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.289
We don't want to go over our
limit here.

00:36:46.289 --> 00:36:46.559
Okay.
 

00:36:46.559 --> 00:36:49.742
So we're going to skip ahead
now and listen to just a little

00:36:49.742 --> 00:36:50.389
bit more.
 

00:36:50.389 --> 00:36:53.329
&gt;
 

00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:55.809
I think that's kind of the beat
here, kind of a slow beat.

00:36:55.809 --> 00:36:59.101
Let's hear just a little bit
more and then I'll start to play

00:36:59.101 --> 00:37:02.338
along, and I want you to count
the number of bars--number of

00:37:02.338 --> 00:37:03.929
measures--in the pattern.
 

00:37:03.929 --> 00:37:06.280
This is a pattern that repeats
over and over.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.679
In music when that pattern
repeats, we call it an

00:37:08.679 --> 00:37:11.030
ostinato--ostinare,
from the Italian word

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.079
ostinare:
stubborn, pigheaded.

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:18.489
So we have an ostinato harmony
here and how many bars is in

00:37:18.489 --> 00:37:23.340
this ostinato--are there in this
ostinato pattern?

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.650
&gt;
 

00:37:24.650 --> 00:38:05.920
One, two, two-- &lt;&lt;music
playing&gt;&gt;

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.856
Anybody able to count the
number of bars in the pattern

00:38:09.856 --> 00:38:13.210
just on that one little quick
playing there?

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.320
Yeah, Betty.
 

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:16.150
Student: Sixteen.
 

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.590
Prof: Sixteen?
 

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:18.630
Okay.
 

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:21.760
You're on the right track.
 

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.110
Roger?
 

00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:24.190
Eight, yeah.
 

00:38:24.190 --> 00:38:26.550
It was a sixteen-bar pattern.
 

00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:29.978
It was a--we played sixteen
bars there, but the harmony of

00:38:29.978 --> 00:38:33.346
the second eight bars was
identical to the harmony of the

00:38:33.346 --> 00:38:34.610
first eight bars.
 

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:36.179
It was just repeating that same
harmony.

00:38:36.179 --> 00:38:37.010
What's the harmony?
 

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:47.400
&gt;
 

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.530
Is this piece by U2 in major or
minor?

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:52.340
Everybody who think major
&gt;

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.619
raise your right hand.
 

00:38:54.619 --> 00:38:57.099
Sinister minor types,
raise your left hand.

00:38:57.099 --> 00:38:57.949
&gt;
 

00:38:57.949 --> 00:39:01.677
It's definitely a minor so it's
one of these unusual pop pieces

00:39:01.677 --> 00:39:02.340
in minor.
 

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.119
All right.
 

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:04.400
So that's chord one.
 

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.980
That's the tonic.
 

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:06.920
What about this triad?
 

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.885
Major or minor?
 

00:39:07.885 --> 00:39:09.690
&gt;
 

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:10.889
Major.
 

00:39:10.889 --> 00:39:11.460
What about this one?
 

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:13.237
&gt;
 

00:39:13.237 --> 00:39:13.699
Major.
 

00:39:13.699 --> 00:39:14.778
What about this one?
 

00:39:14.778 --> 00:39:16.289
&gt;
 

00:39:16.289 --> 00:39:17.159
Minor.
 

00:39:17.159 --> 00:39:17.719
Okay.
 

00:39:17.719 --> 00:39:20.340
Then back to &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.650
minor, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:25.789
major, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:39:25.789 --> 00:39:27.570
and minor at the end.
 

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.889
So that's our eight-bar pattern.
 

00:39:29.889 --> 00:39:32.420
Now maybe even kind of sing
along with this.

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:34.277
My question to you,
and this is the last one with

00:39:34.277 --> 00:39:37.052
this piece,
is: is this an example of a

00:39:37.052 --> 00:39:42.262
regular rate of harmonic change
or an irregular rate of harmonic

00:39:42.262 --> 00:39:43.090
change?
 

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.920
So here we go.
 

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:47.072
Maybe I'll just play it on the
piano--just the simplest thing

00:39:47.072 --> 00:39:47.440
here.
 

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.130
Ready, go.
 

00:39:49.130 --> 00:40:19.579
&gt;
 

00:40:19.579 --> 00:40:20.570
So what do you think?
 

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.599
Regular or irregular?
 

00:40:21.599 --> 00:40:23.269
How many think regular?
 

00:40:23.269 --> 00:40:26.110
How many think irregular?
 

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.920
It's actually irregular.
 

00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.070
Thaddeus, tell me why.
 

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:32.929
Anybody tell me why?
 

00:40:32.929 --> 00:40:36.190
I just like to put you on the
spot here but you got it right.

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:40.195
Student: Well,
&gt;

00:40:40.195 --> 00:40:42.315
. 
Prof: Well,

00:40:42.315 --> 00:40:42.496
no.
 

00:40:42.496 --> 00:40:45.664
They were kind of falling
on--they were falling on the

00:40:45.664 --> 00:40:49.074
meter, okay, but there was one
moment when something was a

00:40:49.074 --> 00:40:50.690
little bit different.
 

00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:52.010
Elizabeth?
 

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.969
Student: It didn't--it
lasted longer.

00:40:53.969 --> 00:40:54.639
Prof: Okay.
 

00:40:54.639 --> 00:40:55.309
It lasted longer.
 

00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:56.518
What's the "it" here?
 

00:40:56.518 --> 00:40:58.619
Student: The chord lasts
longer at the end of the phrase.

00:40:58.619 --> 00:40:59.041
Prof: Okay.
 

00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:00.309
At the end of the phrase,
&gt;

00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:04.434
seven--no, six--seven-two,
eight-two, so that one lasted

00:41:04.434 --> 00:41:07.360
two bars: &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.750
one-two, two-two,
three-two, four-two,

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:14.599
five-two, six-two,
seven-two, eight-two.

00:41:14.599 --> 00:41:17.900
So one of those chords lasted,
actually--one of those chords

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.369
toward the end there lasted
twice as long as all the others.

00:41:21.369 --> 00:41:23.030
Roger, a question?
 

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:26.250
Student:
&gt;

00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:29.059
Prof: It could
conceivably be a rest but that

00:41:29.059 --> 00:41:31.871
would give us kind of a
seven-bar phrase and I don't

00:41:31.871 --> 00:41:33.360
like seven-bar phrases.
 

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.425
I've never met a seven-bar
phrase that I was really

00:41:35.425 --> 00:41:36.210
comfortable with.
 

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:39.679
And musicians generally don't
like that so it's better to go

00:41:39.679 --> 00:41:41.659
with--
I've used this for the first

00:41:41.659 --> 00:41:44.731
time in section the other day
and I'll use it again here a

00:41:44.731 --> 00:41:45.539
second time.
 

00:41:45.539 --> 00:41:49.213
Occam's razor:
if there's a simple solution,

00:41:49.213 --> 00:41:50.239
go for it.
 

00:41:50.239 --> 00:41:52.967
And so take the idea of
symmetry and assume that it's an

00:41:52.967 --> 00:41:55.994
eight-bar phrase and you've got
one chord holding for an extra

00:41:55.994 --> 00:41:58.728
chord,
but theoretically that's

00:41:58.728 --> 00:41:59.639
possible.
 

00:41:59.639 --> 00:42:01.179
A question here?
 

00:42:01.179 --> 00:42:08.469
Student:
&gt;

00:42:08.469 --> 00:42:12.442
Prof: We would not get
in to that but it would still be

00:42:12.442 --> 00:42:13.809
considered regular.
 

00:42:13.809 --> 00:42:16.771
All they're doing is filling
between chord--like Peter

00:42:16.771 --> 00:42:17.329
Salovey.
 

00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:18.829
&gt;
 

00:42:18.829 --> 00:42:19.456
Okay.
 

00:42:19.456 --> 00:42:25.469
All here's doing is
&gt;

00:42:25.469 --> 00:42:27.239
and if he comes-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:42:27.239 --> 00:42:29.050
playing other things along the
way that's still regular.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.172
But that's far more
sophisticated than we're ever

00:42:31.172 --> 00:42:31.969
going to get to.
 

00:42:31.969 --> 00:42:34.443
We're just going to go
"plunk, plunk,

00:42:34.443 --> 00:42:35.289
plunk."
 

00:42:35.289 --> 00:42:35.900
Okay?
 

00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.860
So keep it very much in the
straight and narrow.

00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.501
All right.
 

00:42:39.501 --> 00:42:43.416
We have one more idea to talk
about and that is the concept of

00:42:43.416 --> 00:42:44.829
key and modulation.
 

00:42:44.829 --> 00:42:50.550
Now this piece by U2
&gt;

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:51.840
is written in a key.
 

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:53.280
It's got the home key here.
 

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.039
It's an odd key.
 

00:42:54.039 --> 00:42:56.730
It's B-flat minor: five flats.
 

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.639
B flat minor.
 

00:42:58.639 --> 00:43:02.530
But it nonetheless is a key and
the whole piece--at least the

00:43:02.530 --> 00:43:05.320
vast majority of it,--is in that
one key.

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:08.590
Occasionally,
composers will change keys.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.268
I was thinking I could play for
you here the Beethoven.

00:43:11.268 --> 00:43:20.760
He starts-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:30.150
So here we are in this minor
key &gt;

00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:31.590
and here he is in a new key.
 

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:32.807
This is &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:43:32.807 --> 00:43:33.489
a major key here.
 

00:43:33.489 --> 00:43:36.619
So composers do change keys.
 

00:43:36.619 --> 00:43:40.507
And when they change keys they
effect what's called a

00:43:40.507 --> 00:43:41.480
modulation.
 

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:47.869
Let's listen to an example of--
Let's listen to an example of a

00:43:47.869 --> 00:43:51.340
pretty simple modulation
effected by Aaron Copland,

00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:55.030
an American composer working in
New York City in the forties,

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:57.905
fifties, sixties and
seventies--wrote a ballet suite

00:43:57.905 --> 00:44:00.159
called "Appalachian
Spring."

00:44:00.159 --> 00:44:03.385
And in it he has one section
where he's working through a

00:44:03.385 --> 00:44:06.842
series of variations on a folk
tune called "A Gift to be

00:44:06.842 --> 00:44:09.550
Simple" and he pulls off a
modulation.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:13.273
So let's listen to Copland's
"Appalachian Spring"

00:44:13.273 --> 00:44:15.789
as he proceeds,
and I'll kind of try to

00:44:15.789 --> 00:44:19.280
duplicate and go crazy up here
at the piano at the moment we

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.760
get to the modulation.
 

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:24.849
Modulations are hard to hear.
 

00:44:24.849 --> 00:44:27.023
The best you can do is that
oftentimes is say,

00:44:27.023 --> 00:44:28.280
"This is unsettled.
 

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.873
Maybe it's modulating,"
and we--I don't--I'm not even

00:44:30.873 --> 00:44:32.739
sure we would ask you,
"Has the piece

00:44:32.739 --> 00:44:33.650
modulated?"
 

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:35.909
They're really kind of hard to
hear.

00:44:35.909 --> 00:44:37.409
But let's try anyway.
 

00:44:37.409 --> 00:44:39.969
So here's a Copland modulation.
 

00:44:39.969 --> 00:45:01.590
&gt;
 

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.880
So here he is in this key.
 

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:25.989
&gt;
 

00:45:25.989 --> 00:45:27.539
I think this is where the
modulation comes.

00:45:27.539 --> 00:45:28.338
Then he's going to bring in
the-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:45:28.338 --> 00:45:28.599
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:45:28.599 --> 00:45:29.849
He's sitting on this note.
 

00:45:29.849 --> 00:45:33.849
He brings in the trombones
&gt;

00:45:33.849 --> 00:45:38.155
and then the trumpet will jump
off from there &lt;&lt;plays

00:45:38.155 --> 00:45:39.268
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:45:39.268 --> 00:45:41.650
to a much higher--he was here
&gt;

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:44.079
and now he's modulated up to
here.

00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:44.119
&gt;
 

00:45:44.119 --> 00:45:47.469
So let's see if we can hear
this modulation now.

00:45:47.469 --> 00:45:50.190
&gt;
 

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:51.300
Here we go.
 

00:45:51.300 --> 00:46:05.539
&gt;
 

00:46:05.539 --> 00:46:06.949
So that's a modulation.
 

00:46:06.949 --> 00:46:10.358
In music--conceptually it's
pretty straightforward but it's

00:46:10.358 --> 00:46:11.239
hard to hear.
 

00:46:11.239 --> 00:46:13.969
I think I've got an--one that's
easier to hear.

00:46:13.969 --> 00:46:17.023
It's a piece I like to use
because it's just off the charts

00:46:17.023 --> 00:46:20.289
in terms of what other popular
music was doing at that time.

00:46:20.289 --> 00:46:21.889
It's a piece by the Beach Boys.
 

00:46:21.889 --> 00:46:24.646
Beach Boys music is extremely
interesting--you might think,

00:46:24.646 --> 00:46:26.550
"these California
airheads."

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.119
No, no, no, no.
 

00:46:28.119 --> 00:46:31.949
This is really musically just
light years ahead of what

00:46:31.949 --> 00:46:35.213
everybody else was doing,
I guess late fifties,

00:46:35.213 --> 00:46:36.489
early sixties.
 

00:46:36.489 --> 00:46:40.329
So what I've got here on the
board is a harmonic scheme and

00:46:40.329 --> 00:46:44.038
we're going to once again for
copyright reasons just take

00:46:44.038 --> 00:46:45.760
little chunks of this.
 

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.664
But you can see that it's a
piece that changes--uses--a lot

00:46:50.664 --> 00:46:51.679
of triads.
 

00:46:51.679 --> 00:46:55.219
So every time you see a G up
here that means we have a chord

00:46:55.219 --> 00:46:58.280
built on G and a triad on E,
triad on A, triad on F,

00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:58.820
D, E.
 

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:02.166
And just looking at this,
this isn't shaping out to be

00:47:02.166 --> 00:47:04.943
one, four, five,
one, so it's moving around a

00:47:04.943 --> 00:47:05.449
lot.
 

00:47:05.449 --> 00:47:09.320
Then it gets to a section where
it does get very boring.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.809
It's very static at that
particular point.

00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:14.239
And then something of interest
will happen.

00:47:14.239 --> 00:47:17.460
So let's listen to a little bit
of this and there are--

00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:22.592
it's a piece in which there are
contrasts between sections of

00:47:22.592 --> 00:47:27.809
movement with wild modulations
and then sections of stases.

00:47:27.809 --> 00:47:49.239
&gt;
 

00:47:49.239 --> 00:47:49.452
Okay.
 

00:47:49.452 --> 00:47:52.047
So here it gets very boring and
we're not going to even listen

00:47:52.047 --> 00:47:52.429
to it.
 

00:47:52.429 --> 00:47:55.360
It's just going to sit there,
&gt;,

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.463
"I'm really hip and I'm
having a great time,"

00:47:58.463 --> 00:48:01.969
but then the text comes back to
"I get around."

00:48:01.969 --> 00:48:04.882
So let's--I think that's
what--I've had to parse this

00:48:04.882 --> 00:48:08.130
thing out into a Frankenstein,
but let's listen to the next

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:08.690
thing.
 

00:48:08.690 --> 00:48:11.420
I think we go back to the idea
of "I get around."

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:27.639
&gt;
 

00:48:27.639 --> 00:48:31.387
More boring stuff at this point
but let's pick it up as we come

00:48:31.387 --> 00:48:34.773
to the end of what I think is
this boring stuff and we'll

00:48:34.773 --> 00:48:36.769
listen to what they do there.
 

00:48:36.769 --> 00:48:47.300
&gt;
 

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:50.260
&gt;.
 

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:51.637
So they're sitting here in
which they're

00:48:51.637 --> 00:48:52.449
&gt;
 

00:48:52.449 --> 00:48:59.190
&gt;.
 

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:02.679
So what kind of cadence have
they give us there?

00:49:02.679 --> 00:49:03.860
Deceptive cadence.
 

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:06.800
Deceptive cadence and that
&gt;

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:13.838
takes us up the half step and
then it jumps-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:49:13.838 --> 00:49:15.780
piano&gt;&gt;.
 

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:15.925
No.
 

00:49:15.925 --> 00:49:18.516
It doesn't jump to the Aaron
Copland "Appalachian

00:49:18.516 --> 00:49:20.619
Spring" but it does the
same thing.

00:49:20.619 --> 00:49:22.199
It does exactly the same thing.
 

00:49:22.199 --> 00:49:25.289
It uses that
&gt;.

00:49:25.289 --> 00:49:28.855
It's going to jump up from the
dominant to the tonic and then

00:49:28.855 --> 00:49:32.907
slide up one more step--
so that now we have now a whole

00:49:32.907 --> 00:49:36.550
section in A-flat and the
original was in G.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:38.079
So he's modulated to A-flat.
 

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:39.447
And it's extremely
sophisticated,

00:49:39.447 --> 00:49:41.800
involving half step modulations
and things like that.

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:46.880
Who would have 'thunk' that
from the Beach Boys?

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.632
All right.
 

00:49:47.632 --> 00:49:49.590
We're going to stop here.
 

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:51.039
We've got sections this week.
 

00:49:51.039 --> 00:49:53.320
We have a test a week from
today.

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.760
If you look at your e-mails
later in the day,

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.259
you'll see an e-mail from me
saying that we are posting a

00:50:01.259 --> 00:50:04.945
prep sheet for the test and it
will tell you all you need to

00:50:04.945 --> 00:50:08.382
know and how to study over the
weekend for the test next

00:50:08.382 --> 00:50:09.320
Thursday.
 

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:13.398
So let's listen to a little bit
of the Aaron Copland as you go

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.000
Professor Paul Bloom:
Two follow-ups on

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.140
yesterday's--I'm sorry,
on Monday's lecture.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.667
One is that somebody came up
after class and asked when the

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:30.195
preference for your own language
emerges in development and

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:33.422
fortunately,
studies pretty much exactly

00:00:33.422 --> 00:00:35.630
this sort of infant
understanding.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.919
She knew the answer.
There's been studies looking at

00:00:38.919 --> 00:00:42.848
newborn babies finding that
pretty much the moment they pop

00:00:42.848 --> 00:00:45.761
out they favor their own
language over other

00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:49.970
language--over other languages.
And this suggests that they are

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.425
listening while in utero,
while in the womb,

00:00:52.425 --> 00:00:55.166
to the rhythms of their
language and developing a

00:00:55.166 --> 00:00:57.936
preference for it.
A second issue is,

00:00:57.936 --> 00:01:02.712
I talked very briefly about a
court case in which the person

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:07.406
was--said at a moment where
someone else was pointing a gun

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:10.640
at a police officer,
"Let him have it!"

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.284
and a police officer was killed.
And that person was charged

00:01:14.284 --> 00:01:17.747
with murder but I admitted I
didn't actually know how things

00:01:17.747 --> 00:01:21.209
turned out and was kind enough
to do extensive research.

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.517
Well, he went to Wikipedia and
[laughter]

00:01:24.517 --> 00:01:28.667
found out the answer.
The answer is he was tried and

00:01:28.667 --> 00:01:33.137
found guilty for murder.
He was then subsequently

00:01:33.137 --> 00:01:36.970
pardoned.
In fact, he was pardoned in

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.980
1988, which is really nice
except he was executed in 1957.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.270
But they did it into a movie.
So, it's a movie.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.789
Okay.
So, I want to do today,

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.194
for the first part of the
lecture, is continue the

00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:54.354
language lecture and then move
to perception,

00:01:54.354 --> 00:01:57.675
attention, and memory.
And what we had spoken about

00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:01.310
was--We first talked about
universals of language,

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.575
then moved to some detail about
the different aspects of

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:09.780
language including phonology,
morphology, and syntax.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.982
We discussed the ways in which
language does the amazing things

00:02:13.982 --> 00:02:17.981
it does, including the fact that
language has used arbitrary

00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:20.759
science or sounds to convey
concepts,

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:25.104
and that languages exploit a
combinatorial system including

00:02:25.104 --> 00:02:29.224
recursion to put together these
symbols into a virtually

00:02:29.224 --> 00:02:32.370
limitless set of meaningful
sentences.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.219
We then talked about
development and made some

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.018
remarks about the developmental
time course – talking about

00:02:39.018 --> 00:02:42.817
the emergence of language from
babies to – where babies are

00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:46.490
really good at learning language
to you who are not,

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.973
whose brains have atrophied,
whose language capacities are

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:55.723
dead.
Final issue is to shift to

00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:58.625
animals.
Now that we know something

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:02.305
about language,
we could then ask do animals

00:03:02.305 --> 00:03:05.900
use--possess the same sort of
language?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.050
And if not, can they learn it?
Now, there is absolutely no

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.758
doubt at all that nonhuman
animals possess communication

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:16.053
systems.
This has been known forever and

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:20.059
is not a matter of controversy.
And if you want to use the term

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.268
"language" to mean
"communication," then the answer

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:25.384
is obviously "yes."
Dogs and bees and monkeys have

00:03:25.384 --> 00:03:28.245
language.
If you want to use language

00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:32.855
though in the more technical,
narrow sense as anything that

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:36.669
has the properties that we
discussed earlier,

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.780
using English and ASL and
Spanish and so on as our

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.889
background, the answer's almost
certainly "no."

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.023
Animal communication systems
fall into sort of one of three

00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:49.853
categories.
Either there is a finite list

00:03:49.853 --> 00:03:52.543
of calls, so vervet monkeys,
for instance,

00:03:52.543 --> 00:03:56.416
have a small list of calls to
convey different warnings like

00:03:56.416 --> 00:03:59.960
"attack from a snake" or "attack
from a leopard."

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.460
There is a continuous analog
signal.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.298
So, bee dance,
for instance,

00:04:04.298 --> 00:04:06.984
works on this way.
Bee dance communicates the

00:04:06.984 --> 00:04:09.429
location of food sources but
doesn't do it in any

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:12.538
syntactically structured way.
Rather, the intensity of the

00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:15.389
dance corresponds to the
richness of the food source.

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.212
And then, you get things like
random variation on a theme such

00:04:19.212 --> 00:04:22.502
as birdsong.
But what you don't find in any

00:04:22.502 --> 00:04:25.961
real sense is phonology,
morphology, syntax,

00:04:25.961 --> 00:04:29.500
combinatorial systems or
arbitrary names.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.660
Now, this much is not
particularly controversial.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.089
There gets to be a lot of
controversy though.

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:37.560
This is the summary about
nonhuman communication systems.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.995
It gets more controversial when
we get to famous cases of

00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:47.170
primates trained by humans such
as Kanzi,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.570
Nim Chimpsky,
and other famous primates that

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:55.000
you may well have seen on the
Discovery channel and other

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.933
venues.
And this is fairly

00:04:56.933 --> 00:05:00.035
controversial.
If you read the Gray textbook,

00:05:00.035 --> 00:05:03.579
while nothing in it is
particularly inaccurate,

00:05:03.579 --> 00:05:06.628
I think Gray is actually a
little bit too credulous,

00:05:06.628 --> 00:05:09.976
too believing in the claims
that have been made about the

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.658
abilities of the animals.
So many scientists argue,

00:05:13.658 --> 00:05:16.543
for instance,
that animals like Kanzi,

00:05:16.543 --> 00:05:20.597
even if they can be said to be
learning words at all,

00:05:20.597 --> 00:05:24.870
learn very few of them.
And it takes them extensive

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.129
years of training to learn,
unlike a normally developing

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:33.930
child who could learn a word in
a day or a word in an hour.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.594
The utterances often have order
but this order tends to be very

00:05:38.594 --> 00:05:41.980
limited and lacks the recursive
properties.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.794
And in fact,
the lack of recursion is not

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:48.343
controversial.
Finally, the utterances of

00:05:48.343 --> 00:05:54.308
chimpanzees--trained chimpanzees
are extremely repetitive so what

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:59.155
you often see on TV and in
documentaries is sort of a

00:05:59.155 --> 00:06:02.353
sampling.
And the sampling could often be

00:06:02.353 --> 00:06:06.140
very impressive but if you take
just what they say at random it

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.526
tends to look like this.
This is typical chimpanzee

00:06:09.526 --> 00:06:13.000
utterances just taken at random:
"Nim eat, Nim eat.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.640
Drink, eat, me Nim.
Me gum, me gum.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.139
Tickle me, Nim play.
Me eat, me eat.

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:22.680
Me banana, you banana,
me you give.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.003
Banana me, me eat.
Give orange,

00:06:26.003 --> 00:06:29.189
me give, eat orange,
me eat orange."

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:33.995
Lila Gleitman once commented
that if any normally developing

00:06:33.995 --> 00:06:37.905
child spoke like this,
his parents would rush him

00:06:37.905 --> 00:06:42.283
screaming to a neurologist.
There's a broader question

00:06:42.283 --> 00:06:45.277
here, which is,
"Why would we ever expect a

00:06:45.277 --> 00:06:48.199
chimpanzee to learn a human
language?"

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.638
We don't normally expect one
species to have the capacities

00:06:52.638 --> 00:06:57.363
associated with another species.
So, bats use echolocation to

00:06:57.363 --> 00:07:01.079
get around and some birds
navigate by the stars,

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:04.337
but there's not an active
research program seeing if cats

00:07:04.337 --> 00:07:07.769
can use echolocation or dogs
could navigate by the stars.

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:10.795
And I think one reason why you
might be tempted to think,

00:07:10.795 --> 00:07:13.875
"well, of course chimps must be
able to learn language" is

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:16.955
because you might be caught in
the grips of some bad ideas

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:20.311
about language.
So, one idea is you might say,

00:07:20.311 --> 00:07:22.139
"Look.
Chimps should use language

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:26.521
because chimps are so smart."
But the response to this is,

00:07:26.521 --> 00:07:32.060
"they are smart but we know
that smart isn't enough."

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.901
We know that the human capacity
for language is not totally a

00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:38.906
result of smartness.
There are smart children who,

00:07:38.906 --> 00:07:41.438
due to some deficit in their
language capacity,

00:07:41.438 --> 00:07:43.639
don't speak or understand a
language.

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:46.439
So, the smartness of
chimpanzees does not in itself

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:49.629
demonstrate that they should be
able to learn language.

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:51.897
You might also point out
correctly that chimps are our

00:07:51.897 --> 00:07:54.549
nearest evolutionary relatives,
which is right,

00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:58.763
so you--one would expect on the
face of it--it's not

00:07:58.763 --> 00:08:03.473
unreasonable to expect us to
share a lot of abilities with

00:08:03.473 --> 00:08:05.649
them.
On the other hand,

00:08:05.649 --> 00:08:09.846
we split from them a long time
ago and plainly humans are

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:13.532
different from chimps.
And there was five million

00:08:13.532 --> 00:08:17.925
years either way and that's more
than enough time for a language

00:08:17.925 --> 00:08:22.205
capacity to evolve.
Now, none of this is to say

00:08:22.205 --> 00:08:27.594
that the study of nonhuman
communication systems isn't

00:08:27.594 --> 00:08:30.794
interesting.
From my own--This is my

00:08:30.794 --> 00:08:33.269
personal opinion I'll raise
here.

00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:36.456
From my own opinion,
the study of the attempts to

00:08:36.456 --> 00:08:39.709
try to teach chimpanzees,
or gibbons, or gorillas,

00:08:39.709 --> 00:08:42.629
a human language like ASL are
misguided.

00:08:42.629 --> 00:08:46.274
It would be as if a team of
monkeys kidnapped a human child

00:08:46.274 --> 00:08:49.480
and tried to train him how to
hoot like a monkey.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.552
It might be enjoyable but it
does not seem to give us any

00:08:52.552 --> 00:08:54.854
rich insights.
What I think is a lot more

00:08:54.854 --> 00:08:57.759
interesting is the study of
these animal communication

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:00.822
systems in the wild.
There's a linguistics of human

00:09:00.822 --> 00:09:04.428
language that has delineated the
principles that underlie all

00:09:04.428 --> 00:09:07.446
human languages.
It would be as extraordinarily

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:11.325
interesting to attempt the same
linguistic program to the other

00:09:11.325 --> 00:09:14.953
communication systems used in
the wild such as the cries of

00:09:14.953 --> 00:09:18.657
vervet monkeys and bee dance.
So, this brings the section on

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:21.655
language to a close but I want
to tell you a few things we

00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:24.099
didn't talk about.
One of the problems with an

00:09:24.099 --> 00:09:27.075
Intro Psych course is we have to
whip through a lot of topics

00:09:27.075 --> 00:09:29.165
very fast.
So, if you were to take a

00:09:29.165 --> 00:09:32.519
course that focused directly on
language you might learn,

00:09:32.519 --> 00:09:34.347
for instance,
more about language in the

00:09:34.347 --> 00:09:37.252
brain, something touched about
very briefly in the textbook but

00:09:37.252 --> 00:09:40.110
something that has a large
literature associated with it.

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.446
Similarly, and related to this,
there's language disorders,

00:09:44.446 --> 00:09:48.856
disorders like aphasias and
disorders like specific language

00:09:48.856 --> 00:09:52.292
impairment and dyslexia.
There is the study of language

00:09:52.292 --> 00:09:54.943
perception and production.
How is it that we do this

00:09:54.943 --> 00:09:58.004
amazing feat of understanding
and producing words in a

00:09:58.004 --> 00:10:01.547
fraction of a second?
Where does that ability come

00:10:01.547 --> 00:10:03.815
from?
There is the study of reading

00:10:03.815 --> 00:10:07.052
which is, in many ways,
different from the study of a

00:10:07.052 --> 00:10:10.167
language.
Remember when Darwin described

00:10:10.167 --> 00:10:13.753
language as an instinct.
He carefully distinguished it

00:10:13.753 --> 00:10:16.868
from other things that don't
come natural to us including

00:10:16.868 --> 00:10:18.270
reading.
And in fact,

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.788
reading is difficult.
Reading is a cultural

00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:22.570
invention, not every human has
it.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.346
And unlike language,
reading is acquired with

00:10:25.346 --> 00:10:27.870
tremendous difficulty over many
years.

00:10:27.870 --> 00:10:30.728
On the other hand,
reading plainly intersects with

00:10:30.728 --> 00:10:32.975
language.
It's a new way of conveying

00:10:32.975 --> 00:10:35.649
language, moving out from speech
to writing.

00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:39.220
And the psychology and
neuroscience of reading is thus

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:42.244
very interesting.
There's bilingualism and

00:10:42.244 --> 00:10:45.602
multilingualism.
The questions people in this

00:10:45.602 --> 00:10:50.225
room typically are going to be
interested in is does it matter

00:10:50.225 --> 00:10:54.849
for how well you learn language
whether you're learning one or

00:10:54.849 --> 00:10:58.837
two or three or four.
How is it that a multilingual

00:10:58.837 --> 00:11:03.080
encodes all these different
languages inside a single brain?

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.878
And so on.
Finally, a very hot issue is

00:11:07.878 --> 00:11:12.224
that of the relationship between
language and thought and I'm

00:11:12.224 --> 00:11:16.426
actually--A few years ago I
taught an entire seminar called

00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:20.990
"Language and Thought" devoted
to precisely this question.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:24.425
And it's a cool question and it
could break up into two very

00:11:24.425 --> 00:11:27.333
general questions.
One is, "Is language necessary

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:30.361
for abstract thought?"
And one way to answer that

00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:34.526
question is to look at creatures
without language like babies and

00:11:34.526 --> 00:11:37.259
chimpanzees and see how smart
they are.

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:39.541
It might be that they're
not--that they're very smart,

00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:41.995
in which case it would suggest
you don't need language for

00:11:41.995 --> 00:11:43.787
abstract thought.
On the other hand,

00:11:43.787 --> 00:11:46.548
it might be that they have
certain cognitive limitations,

00:11:46.548 --> 00:11:48.965
which would suggest that
language is essential for

00:11:48.965 --> 00:11:51.624
abstract thought.
Then there's the related

00:11:51.624 --> 00:11:53.954
question.
Even once you know a language,

00:11:53.954 --> 00:11:57.247
does the structural properties
of the language that you know

00:11:57.247 --> 00:12:00.702
affect the way you think?
And the claim that the language

00:12:00.702 --> 00:12:04.061
you know affects how you think
is sometimes described as

00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:07.419
linguistic relativity or the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

00:12:07.419 --> 00:12:09.741
So for instance,
there's a lot of research

00:12:09.741 --> 00:12:13.364
looking at speakers of different
languages such as English versus

00:12:13.364 --> 00:12:16.535
Korean and seeing whether
structural differences in these

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:19.966
languages affect how you think.
Now, some of this work is

00:12:19.966 --> 00:12:22.960
discussed in the readings,
the book--the Gray textbook,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.813
and the selections from The
Norton Anthology. And this

00:12:26.813 --> 00:12:29.687
makes up--again,
I've showed this to you on

00:12:29.687 --> 00:12:33.584
Monday--your reading response
where you have to address this

00:12:33.584 --> 00:12:37.020
question and take your best shot
at answering it.

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.110
What are your questions about
language?

00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:00.480
Yes.
Student: [inaudible]

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:06.360
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question was raised,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.873
"Some people learn languages
easier than others and how do we

00:13:09.873 --> 00:13:13.042
explain this?"
And the answer is you could ask

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:17.508
the question both with regard to
first language learning – so

00:13:17.508 --> 00:13:20.750
some children learn language
very quickly,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:23.774
some are very slow – and also
with regard to second language

00:13:23.774 --> 00:13:25.659
learning.
Some of you are breezing

00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:28.730
through your second language
requirement here at Yale.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.809
Others are struggling and
miserable.

00:13:31.809 --> 00:13:34.360
And there's considerable
variation.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.950
There's the story of Einstein
who was very slow to learn

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:41.409
language and didn't speak at all
until he was four.

00:13:41.409 --> 00:13:43.709
And in fact,
he was a--He said his first

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:46.952
words when all of a sudden he
was having supper with his

00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:49.900
parents and he put down the
spoon and he said,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.182
"The soup is too hot."
And his parents stared in

00:13:54.182 --> 00:13:56.860
astonishment and said,
"You've never spoken before."

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.658
And he said,
"Well, up to now everything's

00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:04.204
been fine."
[laughter]

00:14:04.204 --> 00:14:07.285
It's not a true story.
[laughter]

00:14:07.285 --> 00:14:11.421
The question of why and where
these differences come from,

00:14:11.421 --> 00:14:15.049
nobody really knows and it's
surprisingly hard.

00:14:15.049 --> 00:14:18.340
There's a slight advantage for
being female.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.403
Girls are slightly more
advanced in language than boys

00:14:21.403 --> 00:14:24.814
but it's not a big one and you
need a hundred people to just

00:14:24.814 --> 00:14:29.250
see it statistically.
There's a big genetic factor.

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:32.032
If your parents learned
language quickly and learned

00:14:32.032 --> 00:14:34.759
other languages quickly,
you are more likely to.

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:39.099
But an understanding of the
brain bases of these differences

00:14:39.099 --> 00:14:43.585
or the cognitive bases or the
social bases is just--is largely

00:14:43.585 --> 00:14:46.450
an open question.
Yes.

00:14:46.450 --> 00:14:50.123
Student: What happens
when parents [inaudible]

00:14:50.123 --> 00:14:54.221
Professor Paul Bloom:
This is actually more the norm

00:14:54.221 --> 00:14:58.107
around the world than the
situation in the United States

00:14:58.107 --> 00:15:01.639
where kids are exposed to a
single language.

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:05.429
What happens is children learn
both languages.

00:15:05.429 --> 00:15:07.415
Children are very good,
as adults are,

00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:10.527
of distinguishing different
languages on the basis of their

00:15:10.527 --> 00:15:13.799
sound system and their rhythms
so they don't typically confuse

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:15.713
them.
And then they just learn more

00:15:15.713 --> 00:15:19.001
than one language.
And that's actually more the

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:22.720
average state of affairs around
the world.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.162
Yes.
Student: You said that

00:15:27.162 --> 00:15:32.380
people who are right-handed
learn languages [inaudible]

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:37.501
Professor Paul Bloom:
The question is about the

00:15:37.501 --> 00:15:41.850
hemispheric specialization for
language.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.954
And I don't have actually much
more to say than what I said

00:15:44.954 --> 00:15:47.470
before, which I agree is deeply
unsatisfying.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.062
If you're right-handed,
language is probably in the

00:15:50.062 --> 00:15:53.803
left side of your brain.
How many people here are

00:15:53.803 --> 00:15:56.890
left-handed?
For you we don't know.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:00.120
It varies.
Some of you have it in the left

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.314
side.
Some of you have it in the

00:16:01.314 --> 00:16:03.596
right side.
For some of you it's kind of

00:16:03.596 --> 00:16:06.409
diffuse.
Now, why is this?

00:16:06.409 --> 00:16:08.305
And in fact,
why are some people

00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:11.790
right-handed and others
left-handed in the first place?

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:16.730
Those are really good questions.
Yes.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:28.460
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:32.253
Yes.
I'll--Yes, that's--I'll answer

00:16:32.253 --> 00:16:34.232
that question.
And unfortunately,

00:16:34.232 --> 00:16:36.559
it's going to be the last one
and then I'll go to vision.

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:38.885
The question is,
"Does learning more than one

00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:42.110
language cause you to learn them
slower than just learning one

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.145
language?"
And it would stand to reason

00:16:44.145 --> 00:16:46.057
that it would.
There's a finite amount of

00:16:46.057 --> 00:16:48.394
mental resources.
If I'm just learning English,

00:16:48.394 --> 00:16:51.730
I use all of it for English.
And if I'm learning English and

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.963
Spanish I kind of got to split.
And you'd expect them to be

00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:57.782
each learned slower.
It's one of the surprises of

00:16:57.782 --> 00:17:00.455
the study of language
development that that

00:17:00.455 --> 00:17:03.509
common-sense view does not
appear to be true.

00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:08.327
Children learning more than one
language seem to show no deficit

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:12.609
relative--in each of their
languages, relative to a child

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:15.742
learning just one language.
In other words,

00:17:15.742 --> 00:17:18.438
if I am just learning English
and I'm a kid and you're

00:17:18.438 --> 00:17:20.930
learning English and Spanish and
you're a kid,

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:25.539
you'll reach the milestones in
English the same time I will.

00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:28.630
Your extra learning of Spanish
doesn't seem to affect you.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:32.469
There doesn't seem to be any
detriment for learning multiple

00:17:32.469 --> 00:17:35.451
languages.
Another question which comes up

00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:38.150
is, "Is there any cognitive
deficit?"

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.149
In other words,
some people have argued that

00:17:40.149 --> 00:17:42.659
learning multiple languages
sometimes harms children in

00:17:42.659 --> 00:17:44.884
certain ways.
This is a claim that's been

00:17:44.884 --> 00:17:46.371
made in Quebec,
for instance,

00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:48.974
over the debate over how
children should be taught

00:17:48.974 --> 00:17:51.814
English and French.
It does not appear to be the

00:17:51.814 --> 00:17:53.717
case.
There appears to be,

00:17:53.717 --> 00:17:57.400
as far as we know,
no down side to learning many

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:02.630
languages when you're young.
Does that answer your question?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.546
I want to move now to the topic
that will take us through today

00:18:11.546 --> 00:18:15.433
and through the beginning of
next week – perception,

00:18:15.433 --> 00:18:19.321
attention, and memory.
And I'm putting them together

00:18:19.321 --> 00:18:22.875
instead of treating them as
separate lectures because

00:18:22.875 --> 00:18:26.360
there's a sense in which they're
the same story.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.398
You see a scene.
You see this scene and you're

00:18:30.398 --> 00:18:32.920
looking at it and you're
perceiving it.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.743
It's coming through your eyes
and you're interpreting it and

00:18:35.743 --> 00:18:37.970
you see something.
You see a man and you see a

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.190
house.
If you were to shut your eyes,

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:42.900
you could still hold that scene
in memory.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:49.160
And a week later,
if I'm to ask you about that,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.690
"What season was it?"
you would do pretty well.

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:58.490
This is the story I want to
talk about – how we do this.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:03.281
And in the course of this I
want to make a series of claims

00:19:03.281 --> 00:19:06.624
that go something like this.
For perception,

00:19:06.624 --> 00:19:10.080
I want to first persuade you
the problem of perception's hard

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:13.018
and that successful perception
involves educated and

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:15.380
unconscious guesses about the
world.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.708
For attention,
I want to suggest that we

00:19:17.708 --> 00:19:21.291
attend to some things and not
others and we miss a surprising

00:19:21.291 --> 00:19:23.680
amount of what happens in the
world.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.039
For memory, there are many
types of memory.

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:29.589
The key to memory is
organization and understanding.

00:19:29.589 --> 00:19:33.799
And you can't trust some of
your memories.

00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:39.400
How many of you remember where
you were at 9/11?

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.541
Many of you are wrong.
And I am never going to

00:19:43.541 --> 00:19:48.440
persuade you of this because you
have certain memories.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.515
And you could tell the story.
Everybody could tell the story

00:19:51.515 --> 00:19:54.160
where they were when the towers
went down.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.787
But clever psychologists on
September 12 said,

00:19:57.787 --> 00:20:00.657
"Let's do a study."
And they asked people,

00:20:00.657 --> 00:20:03.440
"Where were you yesterday when
you heard the news?"

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.325
And they told them.
And then they went back to them

00:20:06.325 --> 00:20:08.573
later, a year later,
two years later,

00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:12.069
and said, "Tell me about what
happened September 11."

00:20:12.069 --> 00:20:14.215
And they said,
"I remember totally where I

00:20:14.215 --> 00:20:16.266
was.
I have a very--" And then--And

00:20:16.266 --> 00:20:20.208
often the story was wrong.
There is a lot like that which

00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:24.879
we're going to talk about.
And the biggest moral then--so,

00:20:24.879 --> 00:20:28.389
I put it really,
in really big print--We are

00:20:28.389 --> 00:20:32.714
often wrong about our
experiences, both of the present

00:20:32.714 --> 00:20:37.859
and of right now.
So, let's start with perception.

00:20:37.859 --> 00:20:41.994
There is a story--I went to
graduate school at MIT and there

00:20:41.994 --> 00:20:45.639
was a story there about Marvin
Minsky who is the A.I.

00:20:45.639 --> 00:20:47.666
guru.
He--If you've heard the

00:20:47.666 --> 00:20:51.250
words--the phrase "artificial
intelligence," that was him.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:55.094
And if you heard the claim that
people are nothing more than

00:20:55.094 --> 00:20:59.102
machines made of meat--also him.
Well, there's a story where he

00:20:59.102 --> 00:21:02.747
was doing work on robotics and
he was interested in building a

00:21:02.747 --> 00:21:06.809
robot that could do all sorts of
cool things that's like a robot.

00:21:06.809 --> 00:21:12.044
And the story goes the robot
had to among--had to write--had

00:21:12.044 --> 00:21:15.543
to see the world.
It had to be able to pick up

00:21:15.543 --> 00:21:19.559
things and recognize people and
see chairs and navigate its way

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:22.410
and Minsky said,
"That's a tough problem.

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.468
It's going to take a graduate
student a whole summer to figure

00:21:25.468 --> 00:21:27.361
it out."
And he assigned it to a

00:21:27.361 --> 00:21:29.720
graduate student for a summer
project.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:33.476
Visual psychologists,
perception psychologists,

00:21:33.476 --> 00:21:37.967
love that story because the
study of computer vision and

00:21:37.967 --> 00:21:42.622
robotics vision and the attempts
to make machines that can

00:21:42.622 --> 00:21:47.930
identify and recognize objects
has been a profound failure.

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:52.183
There is, at this point,
no machine on earth that could

00:21:52.183 --> 00:21:57.146
recognize people and objects and
things at the level of a really

00:21:57.146 --> 00:22:01.548
dumb one-year-old.
And the reason why is that it's

00:22:01.548 --> 00:22:06.369
a much harder problem than
anybody could have expected.

00:22:06.369 --> 00:22:10.490
Well, what makes it such a hard
problem?

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:13.486
Well, one reason why you might
think it's an easy problem is

00:22:13.486 --> 00:22:15.633
you say, "Okay.
We have to figure out the

00:22:15.633 --> 00:22:19.329
problem of how people see.
Well, here's what we do."

00:22:19.329 --> 00:22:23.049
You're in--You're over there
and here's your eye.

00:22:23.049 --> 00:22:25.902
And somehow it has to get to
this television monitor and then

00:22:25.902 --> 00:22:28.850
you look at it and that'll solve
the problem of how you see.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:31.892
So, sometimes people say, "Hey.
I hear the eye flips things

00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:33.944
upside down.
I guess this guy is going to

00:22:33.944 --> 00:22:36.320
have to get used to looking at
things upside down.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:39.069
That's an interesting problem."
No.

00:22:39.069 --> 00:22:43.373
That's not the way to look at
it because that doesn't answer

00:22:43.373 --> 00:22:46.048
any questions.
That just pushes the question

00:22:46.048 --> 00:22:46.750
back.
Fine.

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.180
How does "he" see?
We're not answering anything.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.265
Similarly, although the
Terminator's view of the world

00:22:53.265 --> 00:22:56.409
may correspond to that ,
that doesn't solve any problem

00:22:56.409 --> 00:22:59.492
of how he actually sees.
So, he has all these numbers

00:22:59.492 --> 00:23:01.388
shooting out there.
Well, he has to read the

00:23:01.388 --> 00:23:02.850
numbers.
He has to see this.

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:10.099
This is my iTunes.
[laughter] That's inadvertent.

00:23:10.099 --> 00:23:15.579
Here's the right way to think
about perception.

00:23:15.579 --> 00:23:19.187
You got the eye,
which is very ugly and bloody,

00:23:19.187 --> 00:23:22.559
and then around here you have
the retina.

00:23:22.559 --> 00:23:24.829
And the retina is a bunch of
nerve cells.

00:23:24.829 --> 00:23:29.420
And the nerve cells fire
at--for some stimulus and not

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:32.795
others.
And from this array of firings,

00:23:32.795 --> 00:23:37.399
"firing… not firing…
firing… not firing," you have

00:23:37.399 --> 00:23:44.369
to figure out what the world is.
So, a better view is like this.

00:23:44.369 --> 00:23:48.383
The firings of the neurons
could be viewed as an array of

00:23:48.383 --> 00:23:51.701
numbers.
You have to figure out how to

00:23:51.701 --> 00:23:57.173
get from the numbers to objects
and people, and to actions and

00:23:57.173 --> 00:23:59.549
events.
And that's the problem.

00:23:59.549 --> 00:24:03.041
It's made particularly a
difficult problem because the

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:06.861
retina is a two-dimensional
surface and you have to infer a

00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:09.759
3D world from a two-dimensional
surface.

00:24:09.759 --> 00:24:12.749
And this is,
from a mathematical point of

00:24:12.749 --> 00:24:15.871
view, impossible.
And what this means is that

00:24:15.871 --> 00:24:19.527
there--For any two-dimensional
image there is an indefinite

00:24:19.527 --> 00:24:23.309
number of three-dimensional
images that correspond to it.

00:24:23.309 --> 00:24:27.290
So for instance,
suppose you have this on your

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:31.359
retina, an array of light shaped
like that .

00:24:31.359 --> 00:24:33.299
What does that correspond to in
the world?

00:24:33.299 --> 00:24:37.033
Well, it could correspond to a
thing just like that that you're

00:24:37.033 --> 00:24:40.165
looking for or it could
correspond to a square that's

00:24:40.165 --> 00:24:43.810
tilted backwards.
And so, you have to figure out

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.494
which is which.
And the way we solve this

00:24:47.494 --> 00:24:52.518
problem is that we have
unconscious assumptions about

00:24:52.518 --> 00:24:56.692
how the world works.
Our minds contain certain

00:24:56.692 --> 00:25:01.380
assumptions about how things
should be that enable us to make

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:05.754
educated guesses from the
two-dimensional array on to the

00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:09.616
three-dimensional world.
And I purposefully did not make

00:25:09.616 --> 00:25:12.604
the slides available for this
class ahead of time because I

00:25:12.604 --> 00:25:15.420
don't want people to cheat,
but there are several points

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.050
where you could look at the
slides and confirm that some of

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.500
the things I'm going to tell you
are actually true.

00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:22.880
And I want to give you three
examples.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.870
One is color.
And I'm going to conflate here

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:28.400
color and brightness.
The other is objects.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.779
The other is depth.
First, the problem of color.

00:25:32.779 --> 00:25:36.210
How do you tell a lump of coal
from a snowball?

00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:40.892
Well, that's a lump of coal and
that's a snowball,

00:25:40.892 --> 00:25:46.269
and it's from Google images.
How do you know which is which?

00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:50.240
Well, a lump of coal you say is
black and a snowball is white.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.514
How do you know?
Well, maybe you have on your

00:25:53.514 --> 00:25:58.130
retina--Your retina responds to
sort of color that hits it.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.387
It's oversimplified,
but let's assume that this is

00:26:00.387 --> 00:26:02.970
true.
So, this is black coming out

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:06.359
and that's white and that's how
you tell.

00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:09.319
But in fact,
that can't be right.

00:26:09.319 --> 00:26:13.430
It can't be right because
objects' color is not merely a

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:17.840
matter of what material they're
made of but of the amount of

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.794
light that hits it.
So, as I walk across the stage

00:26:21.794 --> 00:26:26.040
I fall into shadow and light,
and none of you screams out,

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:29.019
"Professor Bloom is changing
colors!"

00:26:29.019 --> 00:26:34.265
Rather, you automatically
factor out the change in

00:26:34.265 --> 00:26:38.119
illumination as this is
happening.

00:26:38.119 --> 00:26:40.309
And this could actually be
quite striking.

00:26:40.309 --> 00:26:43.830
So, you see this display over
here.

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:49.013
Take a look at those two blocks.
I take it you see this one as

00:26:49.013 --> 00:26:52.569
lighter than that one.
You do.

00:26:52.569 --> 00:26:57.744
You might imagine this is
because this strip is lighter

00:26:57.744 --> 00:27:01.700
than this but it isn't.
They're the same.

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.022
And you won't believe me until
you actually print it out and

00:27:06.022 --> 00:27:09.320
take a look, but they are in
fact the same.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.664
I'll show it to you.
And you could say I'm tricking

00:27:11.664 --> 00:27:13.120
you but this is the way it
works.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.969
There's the close-up.
So, remember we're comparing

00:27:15.969 --> 00:27:19.972
this and this.
Now, let's take away other

00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:26.870
parts of the environment and
you'll see they're the same.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:32.036
Now you say, "But hold it.
This can't be the same as this"

00:27:32.036 --> 00:27:35.250
but the answer is--goes like
this.

00:27:35.250 --> 00:27:39.180
We know shadows make surfaces
darker.

00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:42.900
We don't know this like "Here's
something I know."

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:47.109
Rather, we know this in that
it's wired up in our brains.

00:27:47.109 --> 00:27:52.663
So when we see a surface in
shadow we automatically assume

00:27:52.663 --> 00:27:58.509
that it's lighter than it looks,
and we see it as lighter.

00:27:58.509 --> 00:28:01.530
And you could show this by
removing the cues to the shadow.

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:05.079
And you see it as it really is.
And this is an illustration of

00:28:05.079 --> 00:28:09.130
how the information to your eyes
is just one bit of information;

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:13.491
the degree of light coming from
a single source is one bit of

00:28:13.491 --> 00:28:17.561
information that you use to
calculate certain assumptions

00:28:17.561 --> 00:28:21.537
and come to a conclusion.
Here's a different kind of

00:28:21.537 --> 00:28:24.411
example: Objects.
You see this and you

00:28:24.411 --> 00:28:28.680
automatically and intuitively
segment it into different

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.832
objects.
You segment it into a man and a

00:28:31.832 --> 00:28:36.599
house and birds and trees.
How do you do this?

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:38.963
It turns out,
to program a computer to

00:28:38.963 --> 00:28:42.860
segment a scene into different
objects is hugely difficult and

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:47.210
the question of how we do it is,
to some extent, unknown.

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:51.137
But one answer to this question
is there are certain cues in the

00:28:51.137 --> 00:28:54.378
environment that are signals
that you're dealing with

00:28:54.378 --> 00:28:57.362
different objects.
And these cues are often

00:28:57.362 --> 00:29:02.140
described as Gestalt principles.
So, one example is "proximity."

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.172
When you see things that are
close to each other,

00:29:05.172 --> 00:29:08.962
you're more likely than not to
assume that they belong to the

00:29:08.962 --> 00:29:11.460
same thing.
There's "similarity."

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.037
That display could correspond
to an indefinite number of

00:29:15.037 --> 00:29:18.289
objects but you naturally tend
to see it as two.

00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:22.139
You do one with one texture
pattern, the other with the

00:29:22.139 --> 00:29:25.210
other texture pattern.
"Closure."

00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:29.192
The fact that this is a closed
square here suggests it's a

00:29:29.192 --> 00:29:32.160
single object .
"Good continuation."

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.725
If you had to judge,
this could just as well be two

00:29:35.725 --> 00:29:40.145
shapes, one that runs from A to
C, the other one that runs from

00:29:40.145 --> 00:29:42.131
D to B.
But you don't tend to see it

00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:44.580
that way.
Rather, you tend to see it as

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:48.482
one that runs from A to B,
the other one that runs from C

00:29:48.482 --> 00:29:50.579
to D.
"Common movement."

00:29:50.579 --> 00:29:53.140
If things move together they're
a single object.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.380
And "good form."
You see the object over there .

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.906
In the absence of any other
information, you might be

00:30:00.906 --> 00:30:04.839
tempted to say that's a single
thing, a plus sign maybe.

00:30:04.839 --> 00:30:08.764
This , because it has lousy
form, you're more tempted to say

00:30:08.764 --> 00:30:11.824
it's two things,
one thing lying on top of each

00:30:11.824 --> 00:30:14.742
other.
And these are the sort of cues,

00:30:14.742 --> 00:30:17.269
expectations;
none of them are right.

00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:21.099
There's cases where they could
all fool you.

00:30:21.099 --> 00:30:25.093
But these are useful cues that
guide our parceling of the

00:30:25.093 --> 00:30:29.300
world, our segmenting of the
world into distinct objects.

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.176
Here they are summarized .
And here's a case where they

00:30:32.176 --> 00:30:34.931
fool you .
So you might think,

00:30:34.931 --> 00:30:40.990
if you're suggestible,
that there is a triangle here.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:44.226
And this is a case where there
are certain cues driving you to

00:30:44.226 --> 00:30:46.190
think that there's a triangle
here.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:48.380
There is, however,
no triangle here.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:53.466
If you cover up these little
Pacmen here, the triangle goes

00:30:53.466 --> 00:30:55.381
away.
Similarly, there is no square

00:30:55.381 --> 00:30:58.760
in the middle .
There is no square.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:31:03.669
It's very Matrix.
And these are illusions because

00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:08.393
these are cues that there should
be a square there,

00:31:08.393 --> 00:31:12.799
the regularity of form.
Finally, "depth."

00:31:12.799 --> 00:31:17.423
You see this and you don't--You
see it on one level as a flat

00:31:17.423 --> 00:31:19.492
thing.
Another level you look inside

00:31:19.492 --> 00:31:21.346
the picture and you see,
for instance,

00:31:21.346 --> 00:31:23.150
the man is in front of the
house.

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:26.990
You look at me and you see the
podium.

00:31:26.990 --> 00:31:29.918
And if you have a terrible
neurological disorder you see

00:31:29.918 --> 00:31:32.847
this strange creature that's
half podium leading on to a

00:31:32.847 --> 00:31:35.776
chest and up to a head that's
sort of--the top of him is

00:31:35.776 --> 00:31:38.119
wiggling and the podium staying
still.

00:31:38.119 --> 00:31:41.080
If you are neurologically
normal, you see a man walking

00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.289
back and forth behind a podium.
How do you do that?

00:31:44.289 --> 00:31:49.642
Well, this is really a problem
because, I could give you a

00:31:49.642 --> 00:31:53.210
technical reason why vision is
hard,

00:31:53.210 --> 00:31:55.216
but crudely,
you got a two-dimensional

00:31:55.216 --> 00:31:58.580
retina and you have to figure
out a three-dimensional world.

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:02.397
How do you do it?
And the answer once again is

00:32:02.397 --> 00:32:06.305
assumptions or cues.
There are certain assumptions

00:32:06.305 --> 00:32:10.720
the visual system makes that
aren't always right and in fact,

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.788
in cases of visual illusions,
can be wrong but will guide you

00:32:14.788 --> 00:32:18.450
to perceive the world in a
correct and accurate way.

00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:22.359
So for example,
there is binocular disparity.

00:32:22.359 --> 00:32:24.890
This is actually a sort of
interesting one.

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:27.829
This is the only depth cue that
involves two eyes.

00:32:27.829 --> 00:32:32.965
If I look at you pretty close,
the image I get here and the

00:32:32.965 --> 00:32:38.101
image I get here are somewhat
different while--or I have to

00:32:38.101 --> 00:32:42.440
focus my eyes together to get
the same image.

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.278
If I look at you in back,
they're almost identical

00:32:45.278 --> 00:32:48.290
because the further away,
given the two eyes that are

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:50.549
static, the closer the images
look.

00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:52.368
And it's not,
again, that you say to

00:32:52.368 --> 00:32:55.170
yourself, "Oh.
Back there an orange.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:32:57.430
It's the same image in my right
eye and my left eye.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.714
You must be far away."
Rather, unconsciously and

00:33:00.714 --> 00:33:04.680
automatically you make
estimations on how far people

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.180
are in depth based on binocular
disparity.

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.062
There is "interposition."
How do you know I'm in front of

00:33:12.062 --> 00:33:14.870
the podium and the podium's not
in front of me?

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.716
No.
How do you know the podium's in

00:33:17.716 --> 00:33:20.068
front of me?
Well, from where I'm standing

00:33:20.068 --> 00:33:22.058
it's right.
How do you know the podium is

00:33:22.058 --> 00:33:26.165
in front of me?
Well, because I'm walking here

00:33:26.165 --> 00:33:30.855
and then it cuts into me.
And unless I'm going through a

00:33:30.855 --> 00:33:33.897
grotesque metamorphosis,
what's happening is it makes

00:33:33.897 --> 00:33:36.530
sense to say I'm moving behind
the podium.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.380
Interposition.
You take the guy.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.740
How do you know the guy is
standing in front of the house?

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:47.633
Well, because there is--you see
all of him and he's blocking a

00:33:47.633 --> 00:33:51.750
lot of the house.
There's relative size.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.058
How far away am I?
Well, if you looked at me and

00:33:55.058 --> 00:33:59.235
you had to estimate how far away
I am, part of the way you'll

00:33:59.235 --> 00:34:03.759
figure that out is you know how
tall a human's supposed to be.

00:34:03.759 --> 00:34:08.891
If you thought that I was fifty
feet tall, you would assume I'm

00:34:08.891 --> 00:34:13.290
further away than I am.
And so, your judgments on size

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:16.320
dictate your judgments about
distance.

00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.971
Usually, this cue isn't
necessary but if you look at the

00:34:19.971 --> 00:34:24.221
Empire State Building--If you go
into a field and you see a tower

00:34:24.221 --> 00:34:27.627
and you look,
your judgment of how far away

00:34:27.627 --> 00:34:32.497
the tower's going to be depends
on your knowledge of how tall a

00:34:32.497 --> 00:34:36.159
tower should be.
If it's this tall, you say, "Oh.

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.760
It must be--" And then you'd be
surprised.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:44.322
There's texture gradient,
which I'll explain in a second,

00:34:44.322 --> 00:34:49.387
and linear perspective,
which I'll also explain in a

00:34:49.387 --> 00:34:52.210
second.
Texture gradient goes like this.

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:54.059
Remember the problem we had
before.

00:34:54.059 --> 00:35:00.691
How do you know if that thing
is this object or an object in

00:35:00.691 --> 00:35:04.732
and of itself?
Well, the answer is things with

00:35:04.732 --> 00:35:08.927
textures will show themselves
because the textures will get

00:35:08.927 --> 00:35:11.827
smaller from a distance.
Now, logically,

00:35:11.827 --> 00:35:15.619
this could still be a single
thing standing upright with just

00:35:15.619 --> 00:35:19.442
dots going up smaller.
But the natural assumption is

00:35:19.442 --> 00:35:23.771
the reason why the dots recede
in this regular fashion is

00:35:23.771 --> 00:35:28.963
because it's receding in depth.
Classic illusion – the

00:35:28.963 --> 00:35:34.191
Mueller-Lyer illusion.
People will see this as longer

00:35:34.191 --> 00:35:36.320
than this .
It's not.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:39.769
If you don't believe me,
print it out and measure it.

00:35:39.769 --> 00:35:44.186
Related to the Ponzo illusion,
once again people see this one

00:35:44.186 --> 00:35:48.161
as--you get illusions named
after you when you discover

00:35:48.161 --> 00:35:51.180
these--this one as longer than
this .

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:53.940
Again, it's not.
What's going on here?

00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:59.170
Well, the top line looks longer
even though it isn't.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:04.321
And one explanation for why is,
these other lines in the scene

00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:09.219
cause your visual system to make
guesses about distance.

00:36:09.219 --> 00:36:13.894
And then you correct for
distance by making assumptions

00:36:13.894 --> 00:36:16.713
about size.
If you have two lines--You'll

00:36:16.713 --> 00:36:20.275
get--We'll get in more detail in
a second, but if you have two

00:36:20.275 --> 00:36:24.130
lines and they take up the same
amount of space on your retina,

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:28.100
but you believe that one is 100
feet away and the other's 50

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:32.206
feet away, the one that's 100
feet away you will see as bigger

00:36:32.206 --> 00:36:36.109
because your brain will say,
"Well, if it takes up just this

00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:39.213
much space but it's further
away, it must be bigger than

00:36:39.213 --> 00:36:42.430
something that's closer and
takes up that much space."

00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:45.568
And that's what goes on here.
For the top line,

00:36:45.568 --> 00:36:49.656
for the Mueller-Lyer illusion,
we assume that this is further

00:36:49.656 --> 00:36:53.540
away and this is closer based on
the cues to distance.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:57.449
And the cue is factored in.
And because we assume that this

00:36:57.449 --> 00:37:00.535
is further away,
we assume it must be bigger to

00:37:00.535 --> 00:37:03.889
take up the same space as this
which is closer.

00:37:03.889 --> 00:37:05.940
Similarly for the Ponzo
illusion.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:09.550
There's linear perspective.
Parallel lines tend to recede

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:12.649
in distance.
If this top one is further away

00:37:12.649 --> 00:37:16.589
than this but they take up the
same size in your eye,

00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:20.530
this one must be bigger and you
see it as bigger.

00:37:20.530 --> 00:37:25.142
And the book offers more
details on how these illusions

00:37:25.142 --> 00:37:27.101
work.
I'm going to end with an

00:37:27.101 --> 00:37:30.219
illusion that I'm not even going
to bother explaining.

00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:32.970
I'll just show it to you
because you should be able to,

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:35.263
based on thinking about these
other illusions,

00:37:35.263 --> 00:37:37.496
figure it out.
It was developed by Roger

00:37:37.496 --> 00:37:40.079
Shepard.
Well, you know that.

00:37:40.079 --> 00:37:42.829
And they are called Shepard
tables .

00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:45.630
And the thing about it is,
these look like two tables.

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:48.310
If you ask people--You don't
frame in terms of here's a

00:37:48.310 --> 00:37:50.648
lecture on visual perception.
You ask people,

00:37:50.648 --> 00:37:53.949
"Which of these tables would be
easier to get through a door if

00:37:53.949 --> 00:37:56.746
you have a thin door?"
People would say the one on the

00:37:56.746 --> 00:37:58.977
left.
This one looks sort of thicker

00:37:58.977 --> 00:38:01.919
and harder to get through.
This one looks longer and

00:38:01.919 --> 00:38:04.579
leaner.
In fact, they're the same size.

00:38:04.579 --> 00:38:13.429
What I mean by that is that
this is exactly the same as this

00:38:13.429 --> 00:38:15.681
.
Now, I'm going to prove it to

00:38:15.681 --> 00:38:19.283
you by showing you something
which took me--on the computer

00:38:19.283 --> 00:38:21.829
which took me about seven hours
to do.

00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:24.085
And nobody's going to believe
it because I could have faked

00:38:24.085 --> 00:38:25.315
it.
But if you want,

00:38:25.315 --> 00:38:27.449
print it out and do it
yourself.

00:38:27.449 --> 00:38:29.480
You just take a piece of paper,
put it on here.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:38.178
Then you move it and the same.
I showed it to somebody and

00:38:38.178 --> 00:38:41.856
they called me a liar.
Anyway, you could do it

00:38:41.856 --> 00:38:45.840
yourself in the privacy of your
own home or study.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.847
But what I'd really like you to
do after you do it is say,

00:38:50.847 --> 00:38:52.219
"Okay.
Fine.

00:38:52.219 --> 00:38:55.650
Why does this one look longer
and thinner than this one?"

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.505
And the answer is the same
answer that will explain the

00:38:58.505 --> 00:39:00.989
Mueller-Lyer illusion and the
Ponzo illusion,

00:39:00.989 --> 00:39:06.627
having to do with cues to depth
and the way your mind corrects

00:39:06.627 --> 00:39:12.563
the perception of depth.
And that's all I have to say at

00:39:12.563 --> 00:39:18.479
this point about perception.
I want to move now to attention

00:39:18.479 --> 00:39:22.940
and memory and I'm going to
treat attention and memory

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.410
together.
We are fascinated with memory

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:30.483
and, in particular,
it's particularly interesting

00:39:30.483 --> 00:39:35.700
when memory goes wrong.
It's particularly fascinating

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:39.230
what happens in cases of
amnesia.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:42.555
So for example,
I need a volunteer who is

00:39:42.555 --> 00:39:47.128
willing to do a little bit of
acting, a very little bit,

00:39:47.128 --> 00:39:50.330
an incredibly little bit.
Excellent.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:51.830
Okay.
So well, you just stay there.

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:54.640
So pretend you have amnesia.
Okay?

00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:00.010
What's your name?
Student: I don't know.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:00.830
Professor Paul Bloom:
Perfect.

00:40:00.830 --> 00:40:03.580
I'm really glad you said that.
That's the wrong answer because

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.720
you don't have total amnesia.
You still remember English.

00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:09.230
Okay.
It's very clever.

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:12.052
Okay.
So you couldn't have lost all

00:40:12.052 --> 00:40:14.330
your memories.
You have English.

00:40:14.330 --> 00:40:19.290
You --So we'll do you.
What's your name?

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:22.416
Oh.
He looks puzzled but he still

00:40:22.416 --> 00:40:27.107
maintains bowel and bladder
control so he hasn't forgotten

00:40:27.107 --> 00:40:29.185
everything.
[laughter]

00:40:29.185 --> 00:40:34.090
Now, I always lose the third
volunteer in that demo.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:40.310
So, what I'm saying is that
memory is a hugely broad

00:40:40.310 --> 00:40:43.367
concept.
It includes autobiographical

00:40:43.367 --> 00:40:46.190
memory, which is what we
standardly think.

00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:48.679
That's a perfectly rational
response.

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:50.860
When I say somebody's losing
their memory,

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.539
"Oh.
I have a movie about somebody

00:40:52.539 --> 00:40:55.400
losing their memory," you don't
imagine a person in diapers.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.394
You imagine the person walking
around, having sex with cool

00:40:58.394 --> 00:41:00.150
people and saying,
"Where am I?"

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:03.123
And [laughter]
so what you imagine is you

00:41:03.123 --> 00:41:06.765
imagine them losing their
autobiographical memory,

00:41:06.765 --> 00:41:09.535
their sense of self.
But of course,

00:41:09.535 --> 00:41:13.900
knowing English is part of your
memory and knowing how to stand

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:17.702
and knowing how to chew and
swallow are all things that

00:41:17.702 --> 00:41:20.741
you've learned,
that you've--that have been

00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:23.744
molded by experience.
There's another distinction

00:41:23.744 --> 00:41:26.411
which is going to come in
regarding amnesia,

00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:29.449
which is there's broadly two
types of amnesia.

00:41:29.449 --> 00:41:33.496
They often run together,
but one type of amnesia is you

00:41:33.496 --> 00:41:38.435
lose your memory of the past.
Another type of amnesia--That's

00:41:38.435 --> 00:41:42.836
the Matt Damon amnesia.
Another type of amnesia though

00:41:42.836 --> 00:41:46.480
is you lose the ability to form
new memories.

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:51.230
And here's a film of a man who
had exactly this problem.

00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:55.896
He was a world-renowned choir
director and he suffered viral

00:41:55.896 --> 00:42:00.720
encephalitis which led to brain
damage which destroyed most of

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.515
his temporal lobes,
his hippocampus,

00:42:03.515 --> 00:42:05.710
and a lot of his left frontal
lobe.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:09.702
It could be--It could have been
worse in that he retains the

00:42:09.702 --> 00:42:12.306
ability to talk.
He seems to be--He's not

00:42:12.306 --> 00:42:16.578
intellectually impaired.
He just can't form new memories

00:42:16.578 --> 00:42:21.048
and so he lives in this
perpetual "now" where just

00:42:21.048 --> 00:42:25.792
nothing affects him and he
feels--This has not always

00:42:25.792 --> 00:42:28.932
happened.
There's more than one of these

00:42:28.932 --> 00:42:31.663
cases and it doesn't always
happen like this,

00:42:31.663 --> 00:42:34.829
but he feels continually reborn
at every moment.

00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:40.440
And we'll return to this and
then ask what's going on here.

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:44.033
But there's a few themes here.
I want to, before getting into

00:42:44.033 --> 00:42:46.685
detail about memory,
I want to review some basic

00:42:46.685 --> 00:42:49.619
distinctions in memory when we
talk about memory.

00:42:49.619 --> 00:42:53.137
So crudely, you could make a
distinction between sensory

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:56.719
memory, short-term memory,
which is also known as working

00:42:56.719 --> 00:43:00.650
memory, and long-term memory.
Sensory memory is a residue in

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.560
your senses.
There's a flash of lightning.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.280
You might see an afterimage.
That afterimage is your sensory

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.114
memory.
There's somewhat of a longer

00:43:11.114 --> 00:43:14.744
echoic memory for sounds.
So as somebody is talking to

00:43:14.744 --> 00:43:17.929
you even if you're not paying
attention you'll store a few

00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:20.703
seconds of what they're saying,
which is sometimes,

00:43:20.703 --> 00:43:23.554
when somebody's talking to you
and you're not listening to them

00:43:23.554 --> 00:43:25.700
and they say,
"You're not listening to me."

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.455
And you say, "No.
You were talking about--" and

00:43:28.455 --> 00:43:31.690
pick up the last couple of
seconds from echoic memory.

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:37.368
There's short-term memory.
Anybody remember what I just

00:43:37.368 --> 00:43:40.602
said?
If you did, that's short-term

00:43:40.602 --> 00:43:44.983
memory--spans for a few minutes.
And then there's long-term

00:43:44.983 --> 00:43:46.980
memory.
Anybody know who Elvis is?

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.469
Do you know your name?
Do you know where you live?

00:43:49.469 --> 00:43:53.252
Your long-term memory store
that you walk around with and

00:43:53.252 --> 00:43:55.820
you're not going to lose right
away.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:59.487
When we think about amnesia in
the movie sense,

00:43:59.487 --> 00:44:04.350
we think of a certain loss of
long-term memory associated with

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.300
autobiographical personal
events.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.129
There is a distinction between
implicit and explicit,

00:44:10.129 --> 00:44:12.469
which we'll talk about it in
more detail.

00:44:12.469 --> 00:44:14.851
But explicit,
crudely, is what you have

00:44:14.851 --> 00:44:18.611
conscious access to.
So, what you had for dinner

00:44:18.611 --> 00:44:21.115
last night.
You could think back and say,

00:44:21.115 --> 00:44:22.910
"I had this for dinner last
night."

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:25.070
Implicit is more unconscious.

00:44:28.630 --> 00:44:32.452
What the word--what certain
word--what the word "had" means,

00:44:32.452 --> 00:44:34.849
how to walk,
how to ride a bicycle,

00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:39.041
that you might not be able to
articulate and might not even be

00:44:39.041 --> 00:44:41.789
conscious of but still have
access to.

00:44:41.789 --> 00:44:45.581
There's a distinction between
semantic memory and episodic

00:44:45.581 --> 00:44:48.903
memory.
Semantic memory is basically

00:44:48.903 --> 00:44:54.155
facts, what a word means,
what's the capital of Canada,

00:44:54.155 --> 00:44:57.724
and so on.
Episodic is autobiography,

00:44:57.724 --> 00:45:05.024
is what happened to you.
That Yale is in New Haven is

00:45:05.024 --> 00:45:09.613
semantic.
That you went on vacation away

00:45:09.613 --> 00:45:14.050
from New Haven last week,
it would be episodic.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:18.222
There is encoding stores and
retrieval, which refers to

00:45:18.222 --> 00:45:21.699
different levels of what happens
in memory.

00:45:21.699 --> 00:45:26.288
Encoding is getting the memory
in, as when you study for a test

00:45:26.288 --> 00:45:30.730
or you have an experience.
And storage is holding the

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:34.371
memory.
And retrieval is getting the

00:45:34.371 --> 00:45:37.603
memory out.
Finally, retrieval is often

00:45:37.603 --> 00:45:41.570
broken, conveniently,
into recall versus recognition,

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:45.030
where recall is when you just
pull it out of memory and

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:48.363
recognition is when you
recognize what corresponds to

00:45:48.363 --> 00:45:52.222
something in the past.
Anybody remember what color tie

00:45:52.222 --> 00:45:55.110
I had on two days ago?
Oh.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:46:00.025
Okay.
Well, that would be impossible

00:46:00.025 --> 00:46:03.750
to remember but if I asked you,
"Is it purple or is it orange?"

00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:12.520
that would be much easier.
[laughter]

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:16.509
Now, you could break up,
crudely, the memory into

00:46:16.509 --> 00:46:18.986
stages.
So you start that sensory

00:46:18.986 --> 00:46:22.871
memory is just the stuff that
comes in leading to short-term

00:46:22.871 --> 00:46:25.440
memory, leading to long-term
memory.

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:29.096
And this stage theory is
something which we'll discuss in

00:46:29.096 --> 00:46:33.753
more detail.
But this leads us to the issue

00:46:33.753 --> 00:46:37.526
of attention.
How do you get memory from your

00:46:37.526 --> 00:46:40.010
sensations, from what you're
hearing?

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:42.199
I'm speaking to you.
You're hearing me.

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:45.389
How does it ever get in to the
other systems?

00:46:45.389 --> 00:46:47.590
What decides what's remembered
and what's not?

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:49.840
There's all sorts of things
happening to you now.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:55.310
The seat of your chair is
pressing against your butt.

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.469
You wouldn't say, "Oh.
I want to remember this forever.

00:46:57.469 --> 00:47:00.239
The seat's pressing against my
butt."

00:47:00.239 --> 00:47:02.094
[laughter]
Your neighbor is exuding a

00:47:02.094 --> 00:47:05.040
certain sort of smell.
You're thinking about something.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:07.489
Your eyes follow him.
Not everything gets in memory.

00:47:07.489 --> 00:47:10.070
You'd go mad if you tried to
remember everything.

00:47:10.070 --> 00:47:13.553
You can't.
So, what determines what gets

00:47:13.553 --> 00:47:17.736
into memory?
Well, one answer is "attention

00:47:17.736 --> 00:47:20.723
does."
And attention is--could be

00:47:20.723 --> 00:47:26.057
crudely viewed as a flashlight,
a spotlight on experience that

00:47:26.057 --> 00:47:31.130
willingly zooms in on something
and makes it memorable.

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:33.039
Attention has certain
properties.

00:47:33.039 --> 00:47:36.325
Some things come from
attention--to attention

00:47:36.325 --> 00:47:40.670
effortlessly and automatically.
Here's an example.

00:47:40.670 --> 00:47:43.080
You're going to see an array of
letters here.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:49.704
One of them's going to be green.
When you see the green one,

00:47:49.704 --> 00:47:53.417
please clap.
[laughter]

00:47:53.417 --> 00:47:57.922
No, not this green one.
[laughter]

00:47:57.922 --> 00:48:01.360
There's going to be another
slide.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:10.710
Okay.
You're ready now.

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:16.110
but there's going to be an "o."
When you see it clap.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.540
Okay.
Sometimes it's work.

00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:35.710
Find the red "o."
[laughter] It's harder.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:40.290
Sometimes attention is
involuntary.

00:48:40.290 --> 00:48:45.125
I need a volunteer.
And all I want to do is I want

00:48:45.125 --> 00:48:48.356
to show you colors on the screen
and I'd like you to name the

00:48:48.356 --> 00:48:49.810
colors as they come out.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:54.249
Do you want this?
Student 1: I'm

00:48:54.249 --> 00:48:57.559
colorblind.
Professor Paul Bloom: Oh.

00:48:57.559 --> 00:48:58.629
[laughter]
The first one is easy.

00:48:58.629 --> 00:48:59.511
See.
This is--You have to just go

00:48:59.511 --> 00:49:01.490
down the colors .
Anybody?

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:07.185
Okay.
Student 2: Red,

00:49:07.185 --> 00:49:08.567
green, blue,
black, green,

00:49:08.567 --> 00:49:10.280
blue, red, blue,
black, red.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:15.760
Professor Paul Bloom:
Excellent.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.610
[applause] Okay.
Now these.

00:49:17.610 --> 00:49:20.760
These will be words but just
name--Okay, you.

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:25.637
Just name the colors.
Student 3: Green,

00:49:25.637 --> 00:49:28.963
red, blue, black,
blue, red, green,

00:49:28.963 --> 00:49:31.646
black, red, blue.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:49:31.646 --> 00:49:33.753
Perfect.
Now, we'll go back to you,

00:49:33.753 --> 00:49:35.822
same deal, words.
Student 4: Red,

00:49:35.822 --> 00:49:37.438
blue, green -- Professor
Paul Bloom: No,

00:49:37.438 --> 00:49:38.300
no, no.
Huh uh.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.940
Don't--I know you can read.
The colors.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:43.390
Student 4: Okay.
Sorry.

00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:45.206
Okay.
Blue, green,

00:49:45.206 --> 00:49:48.545
red, green, black,
green, blue,

00:49:48.545 --> 00:49:55.559
black, red, Professor Paul
Bloom: Very good actually.

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:59.599
[laughter]
That's known as the Stroop

00:49:59.599 --> 00:50:02.566
effect.
Being an expert reader,

00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:07.670
as you are, your knowledge of
reading, your attention to what

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:11.669
the words meant,
subverted your desire to do the

00:50:11.669 --> 00:50:14.240
task.
You couldn't make that go away

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.453
even if you wanted to.
If somebody gave you $1,000 to

00:50:17.453 --> 00:50:21.113
read this as fast as you read
this, and as fast as you read

00:50:21.113 --> 00:50:24.780
this, you'd be unable to.
You can't block it.

00:50:24.780 --> 00:50:29.621
There is some work--There are
some interesting discoveries

00:50:29.621 --> 00:50:32.880
about attention.
I have a demonstration here.

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.135
I'd like people actually--It's
important--Some of you may have

00:50:36.135 --> 00:50:39.143
seen this before.
It's important for you to be

00:50:39.143 --> 00:50:42.208
silent throughout it.
What you're going to see is

00:50:42.208 --> 00:50:45.150
you're going to see two teams of
basketball players.

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:52.380
One of them is going to have
white T-shirts.

00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:54.719
The other one will have black
T-shirts.

00:50:54.719 --> 00:50:57.750
They'll be passing balls back
and forth.

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:02.591
What I'd like you to do is
count in your head how many

00:51:02.591 --> 00:51:06.519
passes the white team does with
the ball.

00:51:06.519 --> 00:51:07.830
[laughter]
What number did people get?

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:12.434
Okay.
Did anybody notice anything

00:51:12.434 --> 00:51:13.777
unusual?
[laughter]

00:51:13.777 --> 00:51:15.490
Did anybody not notice anything
unusual?

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:18.742
Okay.
Some people did not notice

00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:22.501
anything unusual.
Those who didn't see anything

00:51:22.501 --> 00:51:26.710
unusual, watch this again and
just watch it.

00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:28.869
[laughter]
About 50% of people when

00:51:28.869 --> 00:51:32.234
counting, who have never seen
this before don't notice

00:51:32.234 --> 00:51:34.208
anything.
But then when you're not

00:51:34.208 --> 00:51:36.650
counting it's kind of obvious
what you're missing.

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:55.551
[laughter]
And this is one demonstration

00:51:55.551 --> 00:52:00.481
among many of the fact that when
you're attending to something

00:52:00.481 --> 00:52:05.572
you have a very small window of
attention and you lose the focus

00:52:05.572 --> 00:52:10.993
on other things.
Here's another different

00:52:10.993 --> 00:52:13.924
example.
I'd like people to watch a

00:52:13.924 --> 00:52:17.414
movie and pay attention very
closely to what happens in the

00:52:17.414 --> 00:52:20.702
movie and try to remember this.
How many of you noticed

00:52:20.702 --> 00:52:24.320
something odd in that movie?
How many of you didn't?

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:29.018
Okay.
Now, everybody look at the

00:52:29.018 --> 00:52:33.564
scarf, the color of the plates
and the food,

00:52:33.564 --> 00:52:36.940
among other things.
The phenomena,

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:40.539
in general, has been called
"change blindness."

00:52:40.539 --> 00:52:44.109
And what it is is we tend to
be--when there's a focus of

00:52:44.109 --> 00:52:46.510
attention focused in a certain
way,

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:49.773
we tend to be oblivious to
other things that go on in the

00:52:49.773 --> 00:52:51.497
environment.
Often it is,

00:52:51.497 --> 00:52:55.806
in fact, quite difficult when
there's a change in scene to

00:52:55.806 --> 00:52:59.360
notice what changes and what
stays the same.

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:07.634
So, in this final demo,
there's just going to be two

00:53:07.634 --> 00:53:12.021
pictures flicking.
Could you clap when you see

00:53:12.021 --> 00:53:13.840
what's different between the two
pictures?

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.475
[applause]
[laughter]

00:53:31.475 --> 00:53:33.510
I myself am terrible at these
and so I have a lot of sympathy.

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:34.630
How many people never saw it?

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:56.570
[laughter] Good.
That's very impressive.

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:57.543
[laughter]
One more time with a different

00:53:57.543 --> 00:53:57.690
one.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:16.700
[applause]
Did anybody not see it?

00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:18.540
Be honest.
I'll give you another try.

00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.920
[applause] Okay.
I'll put you out of your misery.

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:48.721
[laughter]
This is work by Dan Simons and

00:54:48.721 --> 00:54:53.450
it's part of an extraordinarily
interesting body of work on

00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:56.630
what's known as "change
blindness."

00:54:56.630 --> 00:55:00.156
And what this means is,
the phenomena is,

00:55:00.156 --> 00:55:05.446
we have a very narrow focus of
attention and huge changes can

00:55:05.446 --> 00:55:09.274
happen that we are oblivious to.
This is why,

00:55:09.274 --> 00:55:12.110
in movies, there are so
many--so much difficulty with

00:55:12.110 --> 00:55:15.327
continuity changes.
Dan Simons is also famous for

00:55:15.327 --> 00:55:19.500
having brought this outside of
the laboratory in some classic

00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:23.534
experiments and I'm trying to
get the film corresponding to

00:55:23.534 --> 00:55:25.786
them.
What he did was that he did

00:55:25.786 --> 00:55:29.360
this great study in the Cornell
campus where he was--where what

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:32.704
happened is they would get some
unsuspecting person walking

00:55:32.704 --> 00:55:35.990
through campus and some guy
would come over and say,

00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:38.760
"Excuse me, Sir.
I'm lost.

00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:40.860
Could you help me with
directions?"

00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.234
And have a map and then the
person would say,

00:55:43.234 --> 00:55:45.088
"Sure."
And then there'd be two

00:55:45.088 --> 00:55:47.289
construction workers holding a
door.

00:55:47.289 --> 00:55:51.113
And these guys were going to
rudely bump between these two

00:55:51.113 --> 00:55:54.736
characters and then the
experimenter gets switched with

00:55:54.736 --> 00:55:57.180
another guy.
So now, when these two guys

00:55:57.180 --> 00:56:00.024
walk away, the subject is
standing there with an entirely

00:56:00.024 --> 00:56:02.356
different person.
[laughter]

00:56:02.356 --> 00:56:07.360
What's interesting is nobody
notices.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.659
[laughter]
They notice if the person

00:56:09.659 --> 00:56:13.690
changes sexes.
"Didn't you used to be a woman?"

00:56:13.690 --> 00:56:16.180
[laughter]
And they notice if the

00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:20.616
experimenter changes races,
but most other changes they're

00:56:20.616 --> 00:56:23.329
oblivious to.
There's another experiment.

00:56:23.329 --> 00:56:27.619
I think Brian Scholl did this
one but it may have been Dan

00:56:27.619 --> 00:56:32.210
Simons where what happens is a
subject comes in to the lab.

00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:35.795
They say, "If you're going to
do an experiment with us,

00:56:35.795 --> 00:56:38.650
you need to sign the human
subject form."

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:40.440
Hands him the form,
the experimenter.

00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:43.147
The subject signs the form.
The experimenter takes the form

00:56:43.147 --> 00:56:45.119
and says, "Thank you.
I'll put it down here."

00:56:45.119 --> 00:56:49.140
Goes down here and then a
different person pops up.

00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:53.328
[laughter] People don't notice.
And there's a certain level on

00:56:53.328 --> 00:56:56.070
which we're oblivious to
changes.

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:59.000
What's weird is we don't
see--we don't think we are.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.687
We think we see the world as it
is and we don't know--notice

00:57:02.687 --> 00:57:05.250
that when we're attending to
something;

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:07.150
everything else gets blanked
out.

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:10.902
And so about 50% of people who
have never seen this demo

00:57:10.902 --> 00:57:14.860
before, the gorilla demo,
they don't notice the gorilla.

00:57:14.860 --> 00:57:18.940
And there's--you couldn't
imagine anything more obvious.

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:23.030
The gorilla study was actually
done a very long time ago.

00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:28.445
And it was originally done in a
different way but I'll show it

00:57:28.445 --> 00:57:33.949
to you just because this is the
original study and now that you

00:57:33.949 --> 00:57:37.640
all know what to expect--Oh,
not that one.

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:45.199
Oops.
Nope.

00:57:45.199 --> 00:57:47.665
That's actually--If you looked
at that quickly,

00:57:47.665 --> 00:57:50.489
it's a current Yale professor.
Oh.

00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:52.739
I'm never going to get my DVD
back.

00:57:52.739 --> 00:58:01.060
Anyway, I'll show you the other
demo on--next week.

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:05.409
I will.
[laughter]

00:58:05.409 --> 00:58:08.770
Any questions about attention
and memory at this point?

00:58:08.770 --> 00:58:13.171
Yeah.
Student: [inaudible]

00:58:13.171 --> 00:58:16.790
Professor Paul Bloom:
Yeah.

00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:20.947
Why does it work that way?
Why is it--Why do things that

00:58:20.947 --> 00:58:24.360
become very practiced become
automatic and involuntary?

00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.500
It's a good question.
I don't know.

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:31.611
We know that they do.
We know that once you--that you

00:58:31.611 --> 00:58:34.960
can't not read once you know how
to read.

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:40.144
You also can't not listen.
If I'm talking to you and I'm

00:58:40.144 --> 00:58:43.336
extremely boring,
but I'm talking to you,

00:58:43.336 --> 00:58:47.250
it's very hard not to listen.
You can't shut off your ears.

00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:50.309
You could put your fingers in
them but you can't shut off

00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:53.588
your--You also can't shut your
eyes without actually shutting

00:58:53.588 --> 00:58:54.864
them.
You can't say,

00:58:54.864 --> 00:59:00.539
"This is a disgusting movie.
I'm not going to attend to it."

00:59:00.539 --> 00:59:02.958
[laughter]
So, that's not answering your

00:59:02.958 --> 00:59:04.882
question.
It's just saying that your

00:59:04.882 --> 00:59:07.320
observation is a right one and a
more general one.

00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:11.340
When you're good at something
and you're over-practiced,

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:14.850
it becomes involuntary and you
cannot stop it.

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:16.990
Okay.
Well--Oh.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:19.619
One more in back.
Yes.

00:59:19.619 --> 00:59:21.053
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:59:21.053 --> 00:59:22.050
What now?
Sorry.

00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:24.630
Over there.
Yeah.

00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:28.820
Student: [inaudible]
right before his accident?

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:30.379
Professor Paul Bloom:
Did he remember things before

00:59:30.379 --> 00:59:31.889
his accident?
Yes.

00:59:31.889 --> 00:59:35.422
He had some amnesia of events
before his accident but he did

00:59:35.422 --> 00:59:37.929
remember things.
He knew his name and he knew

00:59:37.929 --> 00:59:40.630
other things about his life.
Okay.

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:42.230
I'll see you next week.

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.940
PROFESSOR: So where are we?

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.620
Well it's the closing lecture.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:14.460
When we first started gathering
in this room three

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.970
and a bit months ago, there was
a photo essay in the Yale

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.400
Daily News with snow
everywhere.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.570
On January 13, when our second
meeting began, campus looked

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.980
like this, and this, and this,
and this, and this.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.050
Whereas exactly three months
later, the Yale Daily News ran

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.440
a photo essay with this, and
this, and this, and this, and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.250
this, and this.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.490
It's spring.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.320
And we're done.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.060
What did we do?

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:04.900
Well we started with Plato's
Republic and we ended with

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.000
Plato's Republic.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.120
The seasons changed.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.830
We, in some ways, performed an
intricate reading of one of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.310
the most foundational
works in the western

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.760
philosophical tradition.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.290
So what I want to do in today's
lecture is to take you

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:32.320
through the course, using
four different paths.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.240
The first thing I want to do is
to think through how it is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.910
that the course goals
were realized.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.690
The goals of helping you think
about how material that you

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.640
learned in a lecture in
Linsley-Chit might relate to

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.220
material that you learned to a
lecture in WLH and how that

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.700
might relate to thoughts that
you had in the library or

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.820
ideas that came up in the
context of conversations in

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.660
your dining hall.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.070
The second path I want to take
through the course is to go

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:16.110
back to the syllabus's initial
description of the three main

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.740
course topics and to point out
to you the way in which your

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.010
understanding of those
topics have changed.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.060
So we'll look at the question
of happiness and flourishing

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.350
as we encountered it in the
works of Plato, of Epictetus,

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.380
of Csikszentmihalyi.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.380
We'll look at the question of
morality as we encountered it

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.270
in the works of Kant and Mill
and again in the context of

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.840
trolley cases.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.950
And we'll think about the
questions of social legitimacy

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.680
and political structures, both
within the context of Rawls

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.580
and Nozick, Hobbes, and
in the context of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.680
the Prisoner's Dilemma.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.300
In the third part of the
lecture, I want to move to

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.570
three themes, which I see as
having unified of course.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.430
Three central questions, each
of which provides us with a

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.450
way of tracing a path
through our reading.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.100
The first, unsurprisingly,
is the theme of

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.380
the multi-part soul.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.940
The second, the theme
of luck and control.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.990
And the third, the question of
the relation between the

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.760
individual and society.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.370
And I want to close the lecture
with, what for me are

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.170
the three central quotations
around which I see the course

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.790
as having been organized.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.880
One from Epictetus, one from
Aristotle and one, which we

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.940
haven't discussed yet as a
group, from the closing pages

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.430
of Plato's Republic.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.410
So let's start out by
remembering what it said on

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.000
the syllabus that the goals
of the course were.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.510
The syllabus told us that the
course had three goals, the

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.820
first of which was to "introduce
you to a number of

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.100
traditional philosophical
discussions that address

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.950
profound questions about the
human condition and to help

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.090
you think about ways in which
the methodology of philosophy

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.200
provides insight regarding
them." And in the course of so

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:46.460
doing, we encountered work by
Plato, by Aristotle, by

00:04:46.460 --> 00:05:01.330
Epictetus, by Hobbes, by Kant,
by Mill, by Judy Thomson, John

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.530
Rawls and Robert Nozick.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.730
And what I tried to provide
you with, in each of these

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:14.430
cases, were the tools to make
these texts your own for the

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.350
rest of your life.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.530
Some of your exercises involved
learning how to use

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.980
the front material or the
indices or the critical

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.980
material that is attached
to the texts.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.810
So in the case of Plato's
Republic and Aristotle's

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.650
Nicomachean Ethics we used
highly annotated editions of a

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.250
kind that let you make your way
into an ancient text that

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.000
might be otherwise
unapproachable.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.590
In some of the cases the
problem was having the

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.450
terminology necessary to make
sense of technical words that

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:50.010
the author was using.

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.130
And there we learned to make
use of the Blackburn

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.220
Dictionary of Philosophy and
other resources as a way of

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.580
orienting yourself in texts
that seemed technical.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.650
Sometimes the language of
the text got in the way.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.310
So for many of you reading the
Hobbes in the original 16th

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.680
century English made it harder
to understand what the

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.860
concepts were.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.060
And there we learned the
possibility of making use of

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.270
modernizations of texts as ways
of understanding them.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.320
And throughout, with the reading
guides, the reading

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.420
questions, the lectures and the
discussions, the goal was

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.990
to provide you with the tools
so that for the rest of your

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.570
life when you look on your shelf
and you see your copy of

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.750
Plato's Republic you can
open it up and learn

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:43.400
from it on your own.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.930
The second goal of the course
was to "introduce you to

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.360
related discussions of these
topics from the perspective of

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.740
other academic disciplines,
particularly contemporary

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.980
cognitive science and
psychology, and to help you

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.200
think about the ways in which
the methodologies of those

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.700
disciplines provide insights
regarding these fundamental

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.330
questions." So we started our
discussion of The Ring of

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:15.310
Gyges by looking at empirical
work by Daniel Batson inspired

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:21.030
by Plato's challenge as
posed by Glaucon.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.800
When we looked at Plato and
Aristotle and Epictetus on

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:30.460
flourishing, we did so in light
Jon Haidt's Happiness

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:34.370
Hypothesis, which brought to
bear on these historical

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:38.470
questions study after study
from the contemporary

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:42.340
psychological tradition.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.680
When we thought about how the
notion of parts of the soul is

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:53.400
manifest in our contemporary
idiom, we made use of the work

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:57.500
of Daniel Kahneman and Amos
Tversky, the heuristics and

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:02.060
biases tradition, as a way of
trying to use our vernacular

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.500
to think about insights that
have been part of every wisdom

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.039
tradition since human
civilization began.

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:14.659
When we thought about what Plato
meant by the harmonious

00:08:14.659 --> 00:08:18.820
soul and what Aristotle meant by
the cultivation of habit to

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.920
allow virtue to become easy, we
thought about it in light

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.900
of Csikszentmihalyi's notion
of flow and considered the

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:32.010
ways in which that notion
might, in a contemporary

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:35.360
idiom, give voice to the
concerns that we saw in these

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.920
earlier authors.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.030
When we thought about what the
costs of a disordered soul

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.820
might be, we read Jonathan
Shay's extraordinary work,

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.450
Achilles in Vietnam.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.430
And we thought about the ways in
which the war experience as

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:55.080
described in Homer's Illiad
and the war experience as

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:59.460
described by returning veterans
give voice to a

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.350
common human experience in the
face of the loss of a certain

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.010
sort of structure.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:11.760
When we thought about the ways
in which social activities of

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.120
those around us --

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:18.520
the inevitable human tendency
conform to the demands of

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.390
authority --

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.850
when we thought about those
questions and how they might

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.980
affect people we did
so in light of the

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.110
work of Stanley Milgram.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.940
When we thought about how it
is that we might go about

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:35.180
cultivating virtue in ourselves
we considered what

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.900
implications that might
have for parenting.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.280
When we thought about the
question of how it is that we

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.360
should explain our responses
to trolley cases, we

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.610
considered the question
of whether the neural

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:53.760
underpinnings with respect to
activations in particular part

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.915
of the brain might be doing some
of the explanatory work

00:09:57.915 --> 00:10:02.150
to answer the questions with
which we were concerned.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.990
When we thought about how it is
that we might make sense of

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:09.780
questions in political
philosophy and the legitimacy

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.230
of the social contract, we
helped ourselves to game

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.010
theory's notion of the
Prisoners' Dilemma and to the

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.220
idea of the Problem
of the Commons.

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.360
When we considered the ways in
which social structures affect

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.770
us, we looked at the question of
social norms and we thought

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:32.340
about the ways in which, though
we had cut a fairly

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.900
wide path through one
intellectual tradition, that

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.910
there was a world full of other
intellectual traditions

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.440
which we had barely touched.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:49.220
In all of these cases the
goal, as with the

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.050
philosophical texts, was to
give you the tools and

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:58.510
resources to make use of this
sort of literature on your own

00:10:58.510 --> 00:10:59.910
in the future.

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:03.500
You performed a directed
exercise where you were given

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:07.880
a core text and asked to find
articles that cited it and

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.720
articles that it cited.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.870
You were asked to take a
particular article from an

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:16.990
empirical psychological journal
and to figure out what

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.510
question it was asking, what
alternatives it was

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.600
considering, what the logic of
the argument was, what the

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:25.910
methods were that were being
used, what the results were

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:27.650
and what the implications
were.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:30.260
And then you were asked to
come up with your own

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.230
experimental design, having
thought through, in the case

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:38.450
of someone else's study, what
a study might look like.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.230
The goal of this was not only
to introduce you to a broad

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.420
swath of psychological
literature, but also to let

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.830
you know that this too is
a body of intellectual

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:56.020
resources, which is at
your disposal for the

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.730
rest of your life.

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:02.400
The third goal of the course was
to help you to think about

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:06.530
your own education in a
synthetic way by "encouraging

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:10.550
you to be sensitive to how
insights from one academic or

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:15.390
other contexts might be echoed
or illuminated by insights

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:21.340
from another." This course is
a case study, a model, an

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:26.250
exemplar, for how it's possible
to look at a problem

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.920
from multiple perspectives.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:33.880
And your final exercise, which
asks you to think about, for a

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.810
question that concerns you, how
you might bring multiple

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:41.440
perspectives to bear on it, is
an attempt to get you to

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.240
think, for the rest of your time
at Yale and the rest of

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.800
your time on this planet,
in a synthetic way.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:55.030
To think about the range of
courses and choices that are

00:12:55.030 --> 00:13:00.220
available to you as being
interrelated in exploring the

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:05.700
fundamental question that
defined human experience.

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.050
So that's path one through
the course.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.760
Three goals.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.240
Three skills.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.320
Path number two looked
at three fundamental,

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.900
substantive, questions.

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:24.370
The question of what can be
said, at least in the context

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:27.830
of the Western tradition and
perhaps beyond, about the

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.320
conditions under which authentic
happiness and true

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.730
flourishing are possible.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.970
The second was the question of
what sorts of demands morality

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:40.820
makes on us.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:45.160
And the third was the question
of political legitimacy and

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:50.310
social structures and the ways
that those affect us.

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:55.640
So if you look back at your
syllabus you will see that the

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:01.100
set of questions which we aim
to explore there are the set

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:05.040
of questions which we
actually explored.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.810
In the context of happiness
and flourishing, we ask

00:14:07.810 --> 00:14:11.430
ourselves how we might think
about Plato's suggestion that

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:15.520
the human soul has various parts
in light of contemporary

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.800
work in psychology.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:21.120
And we explored, not only
Plato's idea that we are

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.970
composed of a reasonable part,
a spirited, and an appetitive

00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:31.100
part, but looked also at
numerous manifestations of

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:35.250
what's now known as the dual
processing tradition.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.920
And we'll talk more about that
when we talk about the

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.820
organizing themes.

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.840
We asked ourselves how Plato's
and Aristotle's discussion of

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:47.080
the importance of friendship
and human attachment are

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.120
echoed in recent discussions
of human happiness and

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.300
flourishing.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:54.590
And sadly because of the weather
that lecture was

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.440
somewhat abbreviated.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.710
I promise next year when I do
the class to do it in more

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.980
detail and you're all invited
back, if you're on

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:05.320
campus, to hear that.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.200
We asked ourselves how the
basic ideas of the stoic

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.640
philosopher Epictetus are
reflected in modern

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.060
therapeutic practices.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.950
And we recognized that the
central insights he has --

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:22.400
of recognizing what is and isn't
in your control and of

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.410
realizing that one can set ones
desires in such a way

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:30.150
that the world feels
more cooperative --

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:35.230
lies at the center of modern
therapeutic practice.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:40.510
And we read in this context the
amazingly moving words of

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:45.220
Admiral Stockdale describing the
ways in which the words of

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:51.210
Epictetus enabled him to survive
and even flourish the

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.280
degrading conditions
of a prisoner

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:56.920
of war camp in Vietnam.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.630
We asked ourselves how
Aristotle's discussion of

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.580
weakness of the will-- what
he calls akrasia--

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.530
connects with current
discussions of procrastination

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:06.970
and how to avoid it.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.400
And we presented ourselves with
various resources for

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.850
structuring our external and
internal environment in such a

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:18.920
way that our reflective
commitments could be what

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.580
guided our practice, rather
than our untrained habits.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:27.110
And we asked ourselves how
Aristotle's reflections about

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:30.280
the role of habit in cultivating
virtue are

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.210
reflected in 20th
century and 21st

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:36.490
century parenting manuals.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.600
All of those were questions
that we considered in the

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.700
context of happiness
and flourishing.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.500
All of those were words on
a syllabus page, whose

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:52.069
significance to you three months
ago was, I hope, less

00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:54.609
than it is now.

00:16:54.609 --> 00:16:59.319
All of these are questions worth
asking yourself for the

00:16:59.319 --> 00:17:01.300
rest of your life.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:05.310
In the context of our discussion
of morality, we

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:08.390
asked ourselves what are
the basic tenets of the

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.650
fundamental moral theories,
which compose the Western

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:18.540
tradition: Aristotelian virtue
ethics, Kantian deontology and

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.940
Millian consequentialism.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:25.760
We set aside, for the purposes
of this course, a fourth very

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.210
important strand that grounds
morality in religion.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:33.170
But we have, as a result of
having thought through the

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.960
questions, what assumptions do
these theories make about

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:42.360
human nature and about the role
of morality, the tools to

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.860
think about even moral theories

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:47.200
that we didn't consider.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.020
We looked for differences in the
moral theories, the ways

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:51.710
in which they emphasize

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.370
consequence or actor or character.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.090
We looked at similarities among
the moral theories, the

00:17:58.090 --> 00:18:01.830
ways in which they stressed the
importance of overcoming a

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.390
certain kind of first-person
exceptionalism.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.960
We looked at the ways in which
these moral theories deal with

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.770
the gap between intention
and outcome.

00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:16.480
And we looked at the ways in
which these moral theories do

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.510
and don't provide different
answers to particular

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:21.990
normative questions.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.170
We went on to ask ourselves,
in the context of our

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:29.210
discussion of morality, how
recent experimental work on

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:33.270
moral intuition, particularly
discussions of the Trolley

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.640
Problem but also discussions of
related cases, relates to

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.130
traditional philosophical
discussions of morality.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:44.370
And how this work connects
with contemporary work in

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.420
neuroscience and related work
in cognitive and social

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:48.750
psychology.

00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:53.270
And through the discovery that
it was extraordinarily

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:57.800
difficult to come up with
systematic explanations for

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.290
why it is that our intuitions
were pulling us one way in one

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:07.040
case and another way in other
cases, we came to realize how

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:13.120
challenging it is to come up
with a systematic theory and

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:18.430
thereby gained further insight
on our original question about

00:19:18.430 --> 00:19:22.290
the structure and complexity
of the human soul.

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:26.300
And we thought about, in the
context of our discussion of

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:32.150
morality, the relation between
moral responsibility and luck.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:35.640
Recognizing, perhaps in the most
profound way, that some

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:39.570
things are up to us and
some things are not.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:43.390
And that the relation between
good intentions and good

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:50.180
outcomes, bad intentions and bad
outcomes, are not as tight

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:53.620
as we might wish
they would be.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:57.290
And we asked ourselves, finally
in this context, when

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:02.270
punishment might be justified
and what moral political and

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:07.560
psychological role it plays as
a way of thinking about the

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.960
counterpart of the
moral question.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.180
And we learned thereby that one
of the ways of thinking

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:18.830
about how things should go when
they go right is to think

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:22.850
about how things should
go when they go wrong.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:28.680
And thereby we gained another
tool for thinking about a set

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.580
of fundamental questions.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.410
Like the questions about
happiness and flourishing,

00:20:35.410 --> 00:20:40.860
these are questions to ask for
the rest of your life.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:45.380
In the third part of the course
we asked a question

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:51.270
about the role of social
structures in allowing human

00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:54.160
flourishing and moral
behavior.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:59.880
And we actually previewed this
part of the course back in the

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.830
beginning section.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:05.280
We asked ourselves what the
experience of Greek soldiers

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.170
in the Trojan War and the
experience of American

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:13.020
soldiers in the Vietnam War
tells us about the role of

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:16.960
social order, themis, in
allowing human beings to

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.760
function effectively.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.470
And we, through that and through
the discussion of

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:27.340
Stanley Milgram's work, got our
first hint of the ways in

00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:34.990
which much of what we are and
much of how we act is

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:40.130
determined, not merely by things
inside ourselves but

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:44.530
also by the communal structures
with which we are

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.070
surrounded.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:51.670
And that makes all the more
pressing, the set of questions

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:55.180
that we asked in the final
unit of the course.

00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:00.560
Inspired by Plato's opening
analogy, that to understand

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.130
the structure of the human soul
we must understand the

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.820
structure of society.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.940
And to understand the structure
of society we must

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.630
understand the structure
of the human soul.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:17.440
And we asked ourselves how it
is that the fact that we are

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:23.250
simultaneously desirous of
possessing objects that others

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:29.330
possess and desirous of being
able to be in a position of

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:34.400
security with respect to that
to which we have become

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:39.550
attached, we discovered that
there was a mathematical

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:43.200
representation, game theory's
notion of the Prisoner's

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.180
Dilemma, that could illuminate
Plato's discussion in the

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:52.450
opening pages of book two of
the Republic and Hobbes's

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:58.040
discussion in chapter thirteen
of Leviathan of the ways in

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:05.850
which social structures come
into being legitimately.

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.860
We then went on to ask
ourselves, looking at two

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:13.640
central texts in the 20th
century Western political

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:18.060
philosophical tradition, how
the work of John Rawls and

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:23.070
Robert Nozick bring out the
importance of what, in many

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:28.110
cases, seem to be two competing
considerations.

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:32.340
Considerations of equality, on
the one hand in the work of

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:36.810
Rawls, and of liberty on the
other, in the work of Nozick,

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:41.430
in structuring a just and
legitimate society.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:46.560
And we asked ourselves how work
in social psychology and

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.540
behavioral economics might shed
additional light on these

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.870
fundamental questions.

00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:57.890
And we asked ourselves finally,
in our discussion of

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:03.260
norms and basic social
structures and censorship,

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:07.140
what the proper role for
non-rational means of

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:11.340
persuasion, including mass
cultural influences such as

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:17.610
cinema, television and music,
is in a democratic society.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:25.010
And we noticed, in an uncanny
way, that Dan Quayle's remarks

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:31.590
about Murphy Brown and the
Madden video games' views

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:38.050
about displaying concussions in
online gaming were echoing

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:44.300
almost verbatim the words of
Plato from book ten of the

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:49.350
Republic when he discussed
poetry and censorship.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:52.960
So that's our second path
through the course.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:56.950
The three fundamental themes
that we identified, the

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.920
sub-questions that we asked with
respect to each of them,

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.370
and the encouragement to all
of you to keep asking

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.260
yourselves those questions.

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:15.240
Path number three: three
organizing themes.

00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.970
And I will, because I don't want
them to go to waste twice

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:23.020
during this section, ask you to
use for the very last time

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.180
in this course, your clickers.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.910
So if you'll take them out for a
slide about four slides from

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:34.460
now and then a couple of
slides after that.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:38.800
You will recall that we began
our discussion of parts of the

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:44.640
soul with Plato's famous
story of Leontius.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.130
He writes in the Republic of
"Leontious, the son of

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.930
Aglaion, who was going up from
the Piraeus along the outside

00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:58.906
of the north wall of the city
when he saw some corpses lying

00:25:58.906 --> 00:26:02.030
at the executioner's feet.

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.830
He had an appetite to look at
them but at the same time was

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:09.370
disgusted and turned away.

00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:12.770
For a time," writes Plato, "he
struggled with himself and

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.160
covered his face.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:19.580
But finally, overpowered by
appetite he pushed his eyes

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:25.100
wide open and rushed towards the
corpses saying, look for

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.240
yourselves you evil wretches.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.308
Take your fill of the
beautiful sight."

00:26:32.308 --> 00:26:36.660
Tempted by corpses, perhaps
we are not.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.620
Tempted by contemporary analogs

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.780
thereof, perhaps we are.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:46.330
And we introduced ourselves, as
a tool for thinking about

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:52.040
this, to George Ainsle's idea
of hyperbolic discounting,

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:58.000
whereby a smaller, sooner
reward, one that from a

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.240
distance doesn't seem as
valuable as our ultimate

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:07.840
reward, comes as the result of
the way in which we relate to

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:14.970
value over time to seem more
valuable to us at a moment of

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:16.760
decision making.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:21.560
So even if your goal is to spend
the weekend preparing

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:27.380
for exams, and even if now,
from the perspective of

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:32.650
Thursday, the larger, later
reward looms greater in your

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:35.100
mind, there is--

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:39.890
let me remind you-- the risk
that as you move closer the

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:45.530
curves will cross and you will
find yourself consuming the

00:27:45.530 --> 00:27:51.730
smaller, sooner reward and
losing the larger, later one.

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:58.510
We talked about this in the
context of this class, where

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:06.300
more than 50% of you committed
to turning off the Internet,

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:10.050
either completely or restricting
your Internet

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:14.610
usage in some way in the
context of class.

00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:19.790
And I asked you on January 25,
back when the snow still

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:23.336
covered the ground, how
successful you had been.

00:28:23.336 --> 00:28:27.540
And at that time, of those of
you who had committed yourself

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:32.230
to some sort of restriction,
56% of you had strayed not

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:34.680
even an itty bitty bit.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.630
25% had strayed just
once or twice.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:44.010
8% said, well a few times
but I'm trying.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:49.620
And 11% of you had fallen
off the wagon.

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:53.270
So the first clicker question,
I'll ask only for those of you

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:58.060
who made some sort of commitment
to yourself, is how

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.150
did it work out?

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:06.350
If you had the Internet pledge,
did you stray, one,

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:12.930
not even once; two, a few times
but not very often;

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:18.330
three, pretty regularly but not
all the time; or four, if

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:22.240
for example you're closing
Facebook now and looking for

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.180
your clicker, you might
want to push yep.

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:32.270
So let's see in the next 10
seconds how our numbers came

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.620
out in comparison to where
we were at the

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.760
beginning of the semester.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:43.860
So of those of you who took the
Internet pledge, 30% of

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.690
you kept it tightly.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:53.060
From all 30% of you, the
rest of us want advice.

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.830
Why did it work?

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.650
What did you do?

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:01.450
What enabled you to carry
through with your commitments?

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:08.120
Another third of you strayed a
few times but not very often.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:14.710
But nearly 50% of you, despite
having resolved to do

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:19.800
something, were unable to
carry through on your

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.660
commitments.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:27.640
One of the goals of this course
is to remind you that

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.250
both in the Ancient tradition
and in the modern dual

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:37.470
processing tradition, there are
theoretical frameworks for

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:42.870
understanding why it is that
we often find ourselves not

00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:47.680
carrying through on what we were
committing to and how it

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.510
is that we might structure
our experience and our

00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:56.660
surroundings in such a way
that that becomes easier.

00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:00.080
So that's one of the ways in
which we thought about the

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:05.520
question of the soul having
parts in this course.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.190
We also thought about the
question of the soul having

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:14.710
parts in this course as a rather
profound challenge to

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:19.380
methodology in any discipline.

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:24.120
We observed, in the context of
the heuristics and biases

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:28.730
tradition, that there are cases
where we are faced with

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:33.350
choices where we know what the
right choice is and we are

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.110
pulled one way by one
sort of instinct and

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.670
another way by another.

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:43.560
So for example, in what are
called frequency/probability

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:49.150
cases, where, for instance, your
goal is to choose from

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:52.640
the box where you have the
greatest likelihood of drawing

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.060
a red ball.

00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:58.930
And one of the boxes has one red
ball and nine white ones--

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.500
a 10% chance--

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:05.790
whereas the other box has 8 red
balls and 92 white ones--

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.920
an 8% chance.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:14.460
We know that there is a
tendency, when under cognitive

00:32:14.460 --> 00:32:19.940
load or when exhausted, to be
pulled towards frequency--

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:23.170
the presence of eight red
balls over here--

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:25.190
as opposed to probability--

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:28.090
the 10% case over here.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:31.990
But we also know that when we're
pulled towards frequency

00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:34.840
rather than probability
in that case,

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:38.060
we're making a mistake.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:43.680
In other of the cases that we
considered, it's not so easy

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.130
to know which answer
is the one that we

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.470
reflectively endorse.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:55.060
We were presented twice in the
course with Kahneman and

00:32:55.060 --> 00:32:58.040
Tversky's famous disease
problem.

00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:02.010
A terrible disease has struck
600 people in your town,

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:04.540
you're the mayor and two courses
of treatment are

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:09.120
available: plan A and plan B.
It turns out that the plans

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.590
are identical.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:15.520
But plan A is described as a
plan where 200 people of the

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.500
600 will live.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:25.470
Whereas plan B, in the second
case is described as one where

00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:29.530
400 of the 600 people
will die.

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.000
And so too with the
probabilistic

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.640
determinations of them.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:41.520
But here are the data that
you as a class provided.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.850
Those of you who faced the
green description of the

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:51.800
choice between A and B were
2/3 of the time preferring

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:56.780
plan A. Those of you who faced
the blue description of the

00:33:56.780 --> 00:34:01.170
choice between plan A and plan
B, the one that phrased it in

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:07.139
terms of 400 deaths rather than
200 lives saved, showed

00:34:07.139 --> 00:34:12.280
exactly an inverse proportion
of responses.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.900
But in contrast to the
frequency/probability case

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.780
it's not clear what the right
way to frame a question of

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:22.550
decision-making under certainty

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.090
versus uncertainty is.

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.020
Should we think about
how many will live?

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.540
Should we think about
how many will die?

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:36.610
Which framing is the right
one isn't so obvious.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:42.070
And this problem persisted as we
over and over again, in the

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:46.470
context of our trolley
discussions, found ourselves

00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:51.230
giving different sorts of
responses to cases that were

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:55.570
theoretically challenging
to distinguish.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:35:00.220
So only 15% of you thought it
was prohibited to turn the

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:03.870
trolley in the case
of the bystander.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:08.960
Whereas 78% of you thought it
was prohibited to have the

00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.890
trolley hit the fat man in that
version of the scenario.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:19.130
We faced it again in the context
of our ducking and

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:21.020
shielding cases.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.870
Almost all of you thought it
was fine, if a bear was

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:29.800
approaching you, to move out
of the way even if the

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.730
inevitable consequence was
that the bear harmed the

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.070
person behind you.

00:35:36.070 --> 00:35:40.102
But almost none of you thought
it was acceptable, if a bear

00:35:40.102 --> 00:35:44.320
is running towards you, to take
the person from behind

00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:49.540
you and put them in front
of you as a shield.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:53.730
Does that difference track
something real?

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:57.060
Or are those just the different
responses that the

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.150
different parts of
the soul gives?

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:04.300
Again and again we confronted
this when we thought about

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:08.470
ways in which we should use
not reason, but habit as a

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:10.890
method for regulating
behavior.

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.920
When we thought about flow as
a state of the harmonious

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.140
soul, where the parts of the
soul that can be pulling us in

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:21.310
different directions might
come together.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:24.740
In the context of the role in
justification of punishment,

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:28.900
where we asked ourselves whether
there is any rational

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:33.890
justification for retribution,
or whether that only concerns

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:37.860
something which, on reflection,
we don't endorse.

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:41.140
We asked ourselves about the
relation among parts of the

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.550
soul in the context of our
discussions last week of the

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:48.310
influences of fiction, of norms,
and other forms of

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:51.180
non-rational persuasion
in shaping our lives.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:56.700
And we asked ourselves about it
tacitly every single day of

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:59.810
this course when we thought
about the difficulty, or

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:05.810
perhaps impossibility given our
complexity, of reconciling

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:10.150
our intuitive and reflective
responses and reaching what

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:14.160
Rawls calls reflective
equilibrium.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:19.380
That it is difficult to bring
principles and practice

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.850
together, that it is difficult
to bring systematic

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:28.090
understanding to particular
cases, does not mean that it

00:37:28.090 --> 00:37:30.450
is not worth trying.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:35.190
But that we discover ourselves
repeatedly frustrated by it

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:40.840
may in itself bring
philosophical lessons.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:45.110
That's theme of the course
one: parts of the soul.

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:51.650
Theme of the course two: luck,
control and circumstances.

00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:56.730
We presented ourselves as a
paradigm case to hold on to

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:01.590
with the contrast between
two kinds of characters.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:05.760
On the one hand, Lucky Alert
and Lucky Cell Phone.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.060
One, a person who did nothing
wrong drove home

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:11.520
and harmed no one.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.360
The second, a person who perhaps
did something risky,

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:18.100
drove home and harmed no one.

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:20.960
And we contrasted those cases
with their unlucky

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:25.900
counterparts, who on their way
home, following exactly the

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:30.640
same course ended up, though
no efforts of their own,

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.040
harming a child.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:40.040
And when I surveyed you about
this in March, almost all of

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:45.100
you thought that lucky alert
had done nothing morally

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.220
problematic.

00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:51.610
97% of you answered that he did
not do something morally

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:53.140
blameworthy.

00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:59.170
In the case of Unlucky Alert,
even though he brought about a

00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:05.180
harm, still 81% of you were
willing to grant him full

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:07.860
moral exculpation.

00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:08.660
But--

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:12.660
and I'm going to retest you
on this in a moment--

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:16.400
when I asked you on March 3
whether Lucky Cell Phone,

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:20.800
somebody who did a slightly
risky thing with no harmful

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:26.490
consequences had done something
morally culpable,

00:39:26.490 --> 00:39:30.370
78% of you said that he did.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:35.620
An answer roughly, though not
as extremely, in line with

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:39.610
your answer to the question
about whether Unlucky Cell

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:43.480
Phone did something morally
culpable, which 92% of you

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.800
answered yes to.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:50.300
So I'm curious, because these
results perplexed me so,

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.990
whether another six weeks of
thinking about moral luck has

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:56.090
changed your views.

00:39:56.090 --> 00:40:01.680
So question, our old friend
Unlucky Alert--

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.680
the one talking on his cell
phone who drives home and

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.540
harms no one--

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:13.500
Unlucky Alert you, who take
risks in your life every day,

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:17.360
risks which could cause
consequences that if they

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.380
occurred, you might regret
that you hadn't taken

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:21.680
precaution.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:27.790
In so doing, oh holders of
clickers, do you do something

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.040
morally blameworthy?

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.940
And let's see how these
numbers come out.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:42.680
So in contrast to your previous
assessment, where in

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:48.790
the case of Unlucky Alert,
81% of you thought he did

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:55.800
something morally blameworthy,
now only 36% of you do.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.010
Why?

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:58.260
I don't know.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:02.070
But it's worth thinking about
why that happened.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:07.990
Let's contrast this with the
case of Lucky Cell Phone.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:12.610
Sorry, I just asked you the
question about Lucky Alert and

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:15.780
put up the question and
articulated the question of

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.070
Lucky Cell Phone.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:19.810
My data are distorted and
I'm going to have

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:21.040
to skip this question.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.790
So I ask you to ask yourselves
at home what you think about

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:26.470
these cases.

00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:30.210
But because I misphrased things
I need to go on to the

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.740
next point.

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.670
Although those are some
nice numbers.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:38.260
What question they're in answer
to will remain a topic

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.510
for future research.

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:44.120
There has been--

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:46.800
I have only six minutes
remaining so I

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.020
want to talk quickly--

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.230
a fundamental and recurring
puzzle that we

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:51.730
faced in this class.

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.640
Determining what is and isn't
in our control regarding our

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.850
attribution of praise
and blame in cases

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.270
of unintended outcome.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:03.200
Resolving the role all what is
and isn't in our control in

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.630
our own internal reactions
to events.

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:08.430
In our recognition of the degree
to which we're shaped

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:12.150
by our societal circumstances,
as explored by Aristotle and

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:15.810
Doris and Shay and Milgram and
the WEIRD studies and Sunstein

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:18.830
and Plato and exploring the ways
in which this should be

00:42:18.830 --> 00:42:23.270
normatively factored in, both
politically and morally.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:25.800
That's theme number two.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:31.360
Theme number three: individual
and society.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:36.680
Sometimes things which are OK to
do if you are the only one

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:42.860
doing them become problematic
if many others are.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.450
There's no problem polluting
if most of the environment

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:49.270
remains clean.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:53.590
There's a major problem
polluting if the result is no

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:55.930
air for anyone.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:00.570
There's no disruption of
patterning if one of us

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:05.730
chooses to give money to
somebody whose work we admire.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:09.820
But, as Nozick points out,
there is a disruption of

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:15.770
patterning if many of us
have the same response.

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:20.590
The costs of those kinds of
patterns may be minimal in

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:25.470
certain contexts, but in
others the fact that

00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:31.170
differences arise between us
may cause a loss of our

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:34.730
fundamental democratic
institution.

00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:37.980
So in the context of our
discussion of the relation

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:42.880
between individual and society,
we were taught, both

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:47.020
in the context of the moral
philosophy section and in the

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.740
context of the political
philosophy section, that if we

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:55.780
want to make real our
commitments to living as

00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:01.100
members of a community, we need
to have a vivid way of

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.060
representing before ourselves
that we are

00:44:05.060 --> 00:44:08.360
only one among many.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:13.280
And we have two beautiful
articulations of that.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.870
One in Kant's formulation of
the categorical imperative,

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:21.410
that my own desires may serve as
the basis for willed action

00:44:21.410 --> 00:44:25.340
only if I can at the same time
coherently will that others in

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:28.480
similar circumstances would
act in the way that I am

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:30.020
choosing to act.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:35.550
And in Rawls's articulation of
the veil of ignorance as a way

00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:39.490
of thinking about what
justice demands.

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:43.215
What's beautiful about these
articulations is that they are

00:44:43.215 --> 00:44:46.710
an attempt to bring a
consideration that reason had

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:51.510
brought us to into a formulation
that we can make

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:54.140
use of intuitively.

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:58.670
Their attempts to give us
vivid ways of remaining

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:03.880
committed to what all of you,
or almost all of you in this

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:06.550
class, suggested you
are committed to.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:13.890
Which is in education, in
housing, in healthcare, and in

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:20.300
the distribution of resources,
to a somewhat more egalitarian

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:25.330
distribution of goods than might
arise if we didn't think

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.270
about our experience from the
perspective of the community

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:29.350
as a whole.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:33.290
And I'll skip-- though put up
on the Internet for you--

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:37.180
three slides from a recent
study showing that your

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:41.280
responses in these cases
were not exceptional.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:46.000
Let me close by pointing you to
three quotations, which for

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.690
me epitomized the course.

00:45:48.690 --> 00:45:52.370
The first is the quote from
Epictetus that tells us when

00:45:52.370 --> 00:45:56.150
we are about to encounter an
experience that we worry we

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:59.600
might find distasteful that we
need to think about what it

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:02.690
would be like and to prepare
ourselves for it.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:06.900
What upsets people, says
Epictetus, are not things but

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.570
are judgments about them.

00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:13.400
The second is the quote from
Aristotle, which I put up

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.590
almost every lecture in the
beginning of the term.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.800
That we learn a craft by
practicing it and that we

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:24.760
cultivate virtues by acting as
if we were already virtuous.

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.750
If there is something that you
wish to become, act as if that

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:32.040
were what you already are.

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.840
And I close with, perhaps the
most beautiful part of Plato's

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:42.640
Republic, the myth of Er, in
which Plato describes the

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:48.590
story of a bunch of disembodied
souls, which

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:50.510
people who were about
to be born are

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:53.190
permitted to choose among.

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:55.800
They're giving models of
lives and asked to

00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.920
select among them.

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:03.480
And it is in the context of
choosing what sort of life

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:07.780
that one wants to live that the
questions of this course

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.960
become most pressing.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:14.460
Think over how the sorts of
things we have mentioned from

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:18.970
January until now jointly and
severally determine what the

00:47:18.970 --> 00:47:21.300
virtuous life is like.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.465
"From all this, by considering
the nature of the soul, reason

00:47:25.465 --> 00:47:28.820
out which life is better
and which is worse.

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.390
Choose accordingly, calling a
life worse if it leads the

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:36.750
soul to become more unjust,
better if it leads the soul to

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:41.360
be more just." And remember that
on the closing page of

00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:47.260
Plato's Republic, Odysseus, the
great hero, celebrated for

00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:51.992
his exploits in the Trojan War,
comes to the recognition

00:47:51.992 --> 00:47:57.180
that the life which will allow
him to flourish most is the

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.726
quiet life of a private
individual who does his own

00:48:01.726 --> 00:48:07.330
work, who focuses on the things
around him in such a

00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:11.920
way that he brings joy
to those near him

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:14.590
and thereby to himself.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:18.610
And with those opening and
closing words of Plato's

00:48:18.610 --> 00:48:22.065
Republic, I thank you for
a wonderful semester.

00:48:22.065 --> 00:48:23.670
[APPLAUSE]

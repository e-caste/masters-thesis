00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.680
Professor John Merriman:
Today I want to talk about

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.920
the fall of France and then
mostly about collaboration,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.190
and next time I'm going to talk
about resistance;

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.340
so, the first part just sort of
briefly.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.190
Looking back on--I ended last
time, or mentioned at the end of

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.642
the hour last time that maybe
1936 was a time when Hitler

00:00:22.642 --> 00:00:26.380
could've been stopped,
in the Rhineland.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.119
All this business and the fall
of France and the origins of

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.430
World War One have to be seen in
the context of--World War One,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.326
there was a sense that
if--after the war there was this

00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:48.877
view that wars were started by
evil people in high places who

00:00:48.877 --> 00:00:55.320
were doing evil deeds in
conjunction with other people.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.035
And Germany signed on the
dotted line, forced to do so,

00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:00.700
saying they had been
responsible for World War One.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.408
And so there was a strong
feeling that Wilson and others

00:01:04.408 --> 00:01:08.656
had that if you had an apparatus
like a League of Nations and if

00:01:08.656 --> 00:01:12.500
you had open covenants that
everything would be okay,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.780
nobody would ever want to have
another war again.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.416
Well, of course,
Hitler was determined,

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:21.886
from the very beginning,
to have another war again,

00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:24.939
and nobody had any illusions
about that.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.897
Mein Kampf was available
in all sorts of languages,

00:01:27.897 --> 00:01:30.439
including English--it's the
book that he wrote,

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.347
My Struggle,
which he wrote when he was in a

00:01:34.347 --> 00:01:37.785
very comfy prison,
after the putsch failed in

00:01:37.785 --> 00:01:43.665
Munich in the early 1920s.
And, so, it's possible to argue

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:50.849
that France, which had a whole
series of rather inept leaders,

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:54.196
particularly in the '20s and
the early '30s--not Léon

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:57.372
Blum, who wasn't inept at
all--but there was this feeling

00:01:57.372 --> 00:01:59.413
that war,
to have another war was

00:01:59.413 --> 00:02:03.349
unthinkable;
and that sort of lies in the

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.046
background.
Now, Hitler's preparation for

00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:11.619
war and construction of the
building of the newest kind of

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:15.389
weapons pushed them--gave them
an advantage.

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:19.992
Hitler's generals were fairly
sure that he would start the war

00:02:19.992 --> 00:02:22.499
in 1940 or 1941,
and the war,

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:26.616
as you know,
starts on the 1st of September,

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:30.159
1939, with the invasion of
Poland.

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:36.460
Now, just--militarily,
why did France fall so rapidly?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.610
You get a sense of this in Marc
Bloch's book.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.114
But the troop strength was
almost equal,

00:02:42.114 --> 00:02:46.427
at the beginning of the war,
after the phony war,

00:02:46.427 --> 00:02:51.370
at the beginning of the
invasion in 1940 of France.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.634
The Germans had 114 divisions,
the French had ninety-four,

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:59.525
and the British had ten,
and then you have twenty-two

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:03.102
Belgian divisions as well.
So, it's about even,

00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:08.970
the number of troop strength.
In tanks the Allies actually

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.555
had superiority.
German tanks were lighter,

00:03:13.555 --> 00:03:17.338
and were faster,
and in the end that--and the

00:03:17.338 --> 00:03:22.733
way they were used,
used not just spread along the

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:28.921
line but used in Panzer
divisions, gave the Germans an

00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:32.419
advantage.
And the French tanks had much

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.106
more armor, and therefore were
heavier, and couldn't be

00:03:36.106 --> 00:03:39.826
maneuvered very rapidly.
But they'd attached a number of

00:03:39.826 --> 00:03:44.033
tanks to each division.
They didn't use tanks as really

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:49.539
as the kind of rapid use that
Hitler had tried out on Poland.

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:52.957
The Germans had a clear
superiority in terms of

00:03:52.957 --> 00:03:57.563
airpower, particularly in light
bombers and in fighter bombers,

00:03:57.563 --> 00:04:01.939
and these were used in Poland;
these had been used in Spain.

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.539
So, they had tried these
weapons out.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:08.955
Now, how do the British and the
French in planning for this war

00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:12.597
that came along--?
They believed that the war

00:04:12.597 --> 00:04:17.631
would be another kind of war of
attrition and thus--some wag

00:04:17.631 --> 00:04:20.870
once said,
and it's tiresome how often

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.184
it's repeated,
that in 1914 the French were

00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:27.339
prepared to fight the War of
1870/71,

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:32.042
and in 1939 and 1940 they were
prepared to fight the war of

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.509
1914.
And there's something to it.

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:40.285
They thought that it would be a
long, drawn-out battle,

00:04:40.285 --> 00:04:44.670
in which--that a strong
defensive line,

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:48.550
the Maginot Line,
those fortresses that were

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.874
stretched along in Alsace and
Lorraine and up in the Moselle

00:04:53.874 --> 00:04:58.462
and other places,
that these would do the trick,

00:04:58.462 --> 00:05:03.757
and that in the end that the
sort of firepower of cannons on

00:05:03.757 --> 00:05:08.963
defense would be much more
important than the kind of rapid

00:05:08.963 --> 00:05:11.829
movement;
whereas the Germans,

00:05:11.829 --> 00:05:16.660
having already slaughtered the
Poles, who defended themselves

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.879
very heroically but as-- you've
seen,

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.792
I'm sure, footage of it,
cavalry sometimes against

00:05:22.792 --> 00:05:25.230
tanks, they believed in rapid
movement,

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.597
and the word,
the term was the blitzkrieg,

00:05:28.597 --> 00:05:31.800
the rapid attack,
the rapid movement.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.117
And, so, one of the problems in
all the planning,

00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:38.919
of course, is that the Maginot
Line stops at the Belgian

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.986
border,
and so once again you've got

00:05:41.986 --> 00:05:45.940
hills and even small mountains,
in the Argonne,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.579
part of Belgium,
and in the east.

00:05:48.579 --> 00:05:54.894
And the French are assuming
that the Argonne Forest and the

00:05:54.894 --> 00:06:01.208
Ardennes in northeastern France
and in eastern Belgium were

00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:06.054
impediments,
physical impediments that would

00:06:06.054 --> 00:06:10.459
not allow the Germans to move
through them.

00:06:10.459 --> 00:06:18.946
And that's exactly what the
Germans did, with their tank

00:06:18.946 --> 00:06:22.837
columns.
And, so, when ten tank

00:06:22.837 --> 00:06:29.558
divisions pour into the Ardennes
they simply waste these lighter

00:06:29.558 --> 00:06:35.959
French tanks which hadn't been
concentrated in any particular

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:40.294
way,
and in four days the Germans

00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:46.440
crossed the Meuse River and are
way inside France.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.548
And the German High Command
thought it would take nine days,

00:06:49.548 --> 00:06:52.762
and the French couldn't imagine
that it was going to take nine

00:06:52.762 --> 00:06:56.277
days--it takes four days.
And Hitler does make this one

00:06:56.277 --> 00:07:00.595
big mistake that allowed Dunkirk
to happen, the withdrawal of so

00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:03.680
many British soldiers and French
soldiers.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:09.572
It's said that he stops the
charge of the tanks,

00:07:09.572 --> 00:07:16.970
he refuels, and this really
allows the evacuation at Dunkirk

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.641
to occur.
And, so, then all of the sort

00:07:20.641 --> 00:07:24.653
of footage that you've seen of
Belgian and French refugees

00:07:24.653 --> 00:07:28.665
walking with everything they
could push in wagons or carry

00:07:28.665 --> 00:07:33.352
with them or put on their oxen,
or horse-drawn carts,

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:38.168
or in automobiles,
are fleeing the battle zones,

00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:43.805
just like the Poles had tried
to do after September 1st,

00:07:43.805 --> 00:07:46.672
1939.
And, so, it's just--it's been

00:07:46.672 --> 00:07:48.896
repeated again,
it's happened again,

00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:52.935
this hell has happened again.
And the difference was in 1940,

00:07:52.935 --> 00:07:56.492
of course, you've got the
German fighter planes strafing

00:07:56.492 --> 00:08:00.438
these refugees and taking huge
tolls of lives and just sort of

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:04.319
picking them off as they move
anywhere they could move.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:10.037
And once again southern France
and central France is inundated

00:08:10.037 --> 00:08:14.941
with people fleeing the battle.
Lots of Belgians ended up in

00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:18.046
our little village,
which then only had about 250

00:08:18.046 --> 00:08:20.439
people in it,
fleeing all of this.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:26.677
And once again another French
government is on the verge of

00:08:26.677 --> 00:08:30.036
disaster.
And the armistice is signed,

00:08:30.036 --> 00:08:34.156
at Hitler's insistence,
in the railroad car--it wasn't

00:08:34.156 --> 00:08:37.435
the same one,
but another railroad car--in

00:08:37.435 --> 00:08:41.869
the Forest of Compiègne
where the Germans had signed on

00:08:41.869 --> 00:08:44.049
the 11th of November,
1918.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:48.569
And you've all seen images of
Hitler going off for the first

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:51.710
time in his life to Paris as a
tourist,

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:55.663
and doing this little jig that
was filmed, and going to the

00:08:55.663 --> 00:08:58.389
Eiffel Tower,
and the Arc de Triomphe,

00:08:58.389 --> 00:09:02.110
and all of this business,
and that was that.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.931
And, of course,
the French--now moving into the

00:09:06.931 --> 00:09:12.276
central part of the lecture--a
new French government

00:09:12.276 --> 00:09:19.098
collaborates with the Germans,
and that government is known as

00:09:19.098 --> 00:09:24.879
Vichy France because France is
divided into two zones,

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:28.533
that that is--and you can read
about this in Chip's book--but

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:31.029
that that is occupied by German
troops,

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:37.149
essentially the north part of
France, and then the so-called

00:09:37.149 --> 00:09:43.270
Free Zone which has its capital
in the spa town of Vichy,

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:47.810
in the Allier.
And the word "collaboration,"

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.487
the English word collaboration,
a word that you all know used

00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:56.095
to mean simply what?
One of the major meanings is,

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.787
that you know,
you collaborate with somebody

00:09:58.787 --> 00:10:01.076
if--in a section,
you're supposed to,

00:10:01.076 --> 00:10:03.802
you and someone else are
supposed to put together a

00:10:03.802 --> 00:10:07.330
report on this or that,
or you do a lab report together;

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.235
or in psychology people
collaborate with eight other

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:13.539
people and one of the problems
is assessing folks' work for

00:10:13.539 --> 00:10:17.014
promotion to see who is the lead
investigator--you collaborate

00:10:17.014 --> 00:10:19.294
with people;
you collaborate with your

00:10:19.294 --> 00:10:22.055
brothers and sisters on trying
to organize plans for the

00:10:22.055 --> 00:10:25.783
holidays, and all that.
That was the use until

00:10:25.783 --> 00:10:29.860
1941,1940/1941,
until World War Two.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.836
It still is one of the uses.
And the term collaboration took

00:10:33.836 --> 00:10:37.629
on a less neutral meaning,
and collaboration,

00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:41.903
because of the experience of
countries like France,

00:10:41.903 --> 00:10:45.836
in World War Two,
where in every country people

00:10:45.836 --> 00:10:50.110
actively helped the Nazis
achieve their goals.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.900
So, collaboration took on this
sort of sinister term as well,

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:59.053
and the word in French,
a collabo was somebody

00:10:59.053 --> 00:11:03.022
who collaborated.
And by the end of 1943 and by

00:11:03.022 --> 00:11:08.082
early 1944, if you were a French
collaborator and you woke up one

00:11:08.082 --> 00:11:13.479
morning and you found graffiti,
with a K, for the German word

00:11:13.479 --> 00:11:17.870
for collaborator on your door,
you were toast,

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.208
because that meant that the
maquis were,

00:11:21.208 --> 00:11:25.707
that the resisters were capable
enough or were confident enough

00:11:25.707 --> 00:11:29.761
to make that kind of threat.
So, the word collaboration has

00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:32.415
taken this very,
very different meaning because

00:11:32.415 --> 00:11:35.340
of what happened.
And again it's not only France.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.857
In Belgium still it's a very
hotly contested issue because

00:11:38.857 --> 00:11:41.450
Flemish were more likely to
collaborate,

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.707
rightwing Flemish,
with the Germans,

00:11:43.707 --> 00:11:45.655
than Walloons.
And in Hungary,

00:11:45.655 --> 00:11:48.034
for example,
where you can go--if you've

00:11:48.034 --> 00:11:50.779
been to Budapest,
my second favorite city,

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:54.851
where you see all those
horrible shoes--not horrible

00:11:54.851 --> 00:11:59.720
shoes, but they were pulled out
of the Danube river after Jews

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.750
and Communists were gunned down
by Hungarian collaborators,

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.977
and were left--now they're
still there, sort of

00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:09.690
cemented--and there's very small
shoes too--this ghoulish

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.142
memorial,
but one that has to be there in

00:12:13.142 --> 00:12:17.620
these places in Bulgaria.
The Germans didn't need to do

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:21.914
lots of things because there
were people in every population

00:12:21.914 --> 00:12:25.990
that were happy to be there,
better--I mean to see them

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:30.120
there--"better Hitler than
Blum," went the shouts in 1934,

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.661
'35 and '36,
and those shouts continued,

00:12:33.661 --> 00:12:37.913
of course, in France.
Now, histories have their

00:12:37.913 --> 00:12:42.672
history, and there is none in
modern French history more

00:12:42.672 --> 00:12:47.175
fascinating,
more passionnant than

00:12:47.175 --> 00:12:51.870
the history of collaboration,
in France.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:55.018
Because even in ma
jeunesse,

00:12:55.018 --> 00:12:59.740
even when I was a kid,
the sort of story was that in

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:04.370
France everybody resisted or
almost everybody,

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:08.440
and hardly anybody collaborated.
And that was a myth that was

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.042
perpetuated by people who had
collaborated very actively,

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:14.679
very willingly,
very enthusiastically.

00:13:14.679 --> 00:13:18.562
And it was also the myth that
was perpetuated by Charles de

00:13:18.562 --> 00:13:21.240
Gaulle, because for Charles de
Gaulle,

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.279
who assumed the kind of mantle
of the resistance,

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:28.016
what he needed to do was to
make people forget the communist

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:31.879
resistance and to see himself as
this sort of mystical body of

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:34.908
the French people,
that as his voice crackled over

00:13:34.908 --> 00:13:36.710
the airwaves,
for those who could hear

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.630
it--and many people who hadn't
heard it claimed to have heard

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.892
it,
on the 18th of June,

00:13:41.892 --> 00:13:45.169
1940--that we must keep
resisting.

00:13:45.169 --> 00:13:49.646
It was part of the mantle that
he would assume on his shoulders

00:13:49.646 --> 00:13:52.533
before he stomped off to
Columbey-les-Deu

00:13:52.533 --> 00:13:56.070
x-Églises,
when he couldn't get his way in

00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:00.379
every issue after the war.
But part of the way that France

00:14:00.379 --> 00:14:04.080
would, the new France,
would present itself,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.541
it had to be that almost
everybody resisted,

00:14:07.541 --> 00:14:10.600
and that only an elite
collaborated.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:15.518
There was a movie from
1953,1954, a documentary in

00:14:15.518 --> 00:14:20.737
which--it's about what happened
to the Jews who taken

00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:24.737
from--arrested in July 1942,
in the Marais,

00:14:24.737 --> 00:14:27.885
the Jewish quarter of Paris and
on Île Saint-Louis,

00:14:27.885 --> 00:14:31.170
and they were taken away,
and first they're put at a camp

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.039
at Drancy, a transit camp,
which is north of Paris,

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:36.689
en Drancy,
and in a place that's called

00:14:36.689 --> 00:14:38.750
Westbork, or something like
that,

00:14:38.750 --> 00:14:42.710
Westerbork, in the transit camp
in the Netherlands;

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.340
and Mechelen or Malines in
Belgium.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.490
I have a student who's working
on that topic now.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.347
But in the film,
in the original film,

00:14:51.347 --> 00:14:53.708
it's a documentary,
you could see French guards,

00:14:53.708 --> 00:14:56.470
gendarmes, they're guarding the
Jews who are there.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.657
And, of course,
when the film was published you

00:14:58.657 --> 00:15:01.129
couldn't have a French gendarme
guarding the Jews;

00:15:01.129 --> 00:15:04.110
they had to be guarded by
Nazis, didn't they?

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.211
So, what they did is they took
the soldier out of the film,

00:15:07.211 --> 00:15:09.350
they lifted him right out of
the film,

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.009
so he's not in the film,
he disappears from the film.

00:15:12.009 --> 00:15:15.738
And until the late 1960s this
myth that everybody had

00:15:15.738 --> 00:15:19.466
resisted, or almost everybody
and only the elites had

00:15:19.466 --> 00:15:23.552
collaborated-- Pétain and
his inner circle--was the

00:15:23.552 --> 00:15:27.093
dominant kind of myth.
And now, since then we've had

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:29.895
what has been called in a very
wonderful book by Henri

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:31.828
Rousseau,
a book that's translated into

00:15:31.828 --> 00:15:33.440
English, the Vichy
Syndrome.

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.128
Now, Vichy--people who didn't
live through Vichy but they're

00:15:38.128 --> 00:15:40.909
trying to find out what
happened.

00:15:40.909 --> 00:15:44.707
And two kind of crucial
events--three kind of crucial

00:15:44.707 --> 00:15:48.139
events caused people,
this collective memory,

00:15:48.139 --> 00:15:52.679
a desire to know what really
happened during this time.

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:55.346
And there are three events,
or a series of events that

00:15:55.346 --> 00:15:57.501
happened.
One was that probably,

00:15:57.501 --> 00:16:02.086
I guess you could say--and this
is what Rousseau and others have

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:06.889
argued--there was a film called
The Sorrow and the Pity,

00:16:06.889 --> 00:16:09.103
which goes on and on,
it's four and a half hours--I

00:16:09.103 --> 00:16:11.627
used to show it in this class
and I think I described this

00:16:11.627 --> 00:16:14.959
once in here,
it had the reputation for being

00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:18.620
a two six-pack film because it
was so long,

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.553
and we would show it in WLH,
and at the end--this was when

00:16:21.553 --> 00:16:24.588
the drinking age was eighteen,
I assure you--there'd be all

00:16:24.588 --> 00:16:26.920
sorts of beer bottles just all
over the place,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.955
it was so long.
And the sound quality isn't

00:16:29.955 --> 00:16:34.200
very good, but it's very
important, because what Orphuls,

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.330
who was the producer,
did is he went to one single

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.629
town, he went to
Clermont-Ferrand,

00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:42.358
in Auvergne,
and he looked at what happened

00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:45.932
there, at collaboration,
and some of the great scenes in

00:16:45.932 --> 00:16:49.375
documentary history are there
when--of the intentional

00:16:49.375 --> 00:16:52.962
repression or forgetting,
when the two teachers,

00:16:52.962 --> 00:16:56.821
if you've seen the film,
they forget about their Jewish

00:16:56.821 --> 00:16:59.620
colleague.
There's amazing things at the

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:02.909
end when they shave the heads of
what they called,

00:17:02.909 --> 00:17:05.266
rather crudely,
horizontal collaborators,

00:17:05.266 --> 00:17:07.799
women who had slept with German
soldiers,

00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:09.497
and at the end of the war
there's these scenes where

00:17:09.497 --> 00:17:11.538
they'd shaved their heads,
and hauled them through the

00:17:11.538 --> 00:17:13.140
streets, not just in
Clermont-Ferrand.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.955
And at the end there is--I
think I said this the first

00:17:15.955 --> 00:17:18.877
day--but there is Maurice
Chevalier who was this sort of

00:17:18.877 --> 00:17:21.513
chanteur,
a sort of crooner of your

00:17:21.513 --> 00:17:25.226
grandparent's generation who
became the famous French person

00:17:25.226 --> 00:17:27.149
in the U.S.,
with his accent,

00:17:27.149 --> 00:17:29.835
like zat.
At the very end of the film he

00:17:29.835 --> 00:17:32.960
says, "well, you know"--he says,
"you know there are these

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:36.470
stories that I was singing in
Germany but I want to tell you,

00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:39.881
I was only singing for
zee boys"--that is,

00:17:39.881 --> 00:17:44.430
the people who had gone off and
been captured in the fighting,

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:47.847
or who had gone and had to go
into obligatory service,

00:17:47.847 --> 00:17:51.910
which I'll tell you about--work
service--had gone to Germany;

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.279
many of them died in the air
raids.

00:17:54.279 --> 00:17:59.286
And at the end he's wearing his
white suit, and his straw hat,

00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:04.210
and forgetting his own very
plebian origins in Montmartre,

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.461
he says, for the Americans who
are going to see this film,

00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:08.910
"but I want to assure that I
only sang for zee boys."

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:10.799
And, of course,
it was not the case at all.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:16.235
But this--what this movie does
is it--and it was only shown in

00:18:16.235 --> 00:18:20.779
one theater, in the Marais,
appropriately enough.

00:18:20.779 --> 00:18:23.099
I saw it a couple of years
after it came out.

00:18:23.099 --> 00:18:25.130
It was still in the same single
theater.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:30.256
It was made for French TV.
It was never shown on French TV

00:18:30.256 --> 00:18:34.067
until 1981, or 1982;
never on French TV,

00:18:34.067 --> 00:18:35.790
never, never,
never.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:39.417
Why?
Because it told the awful

00:18:39.417 --> 00:18:44.056
truth, that lots of people
believed "better Hitler than

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.825
Blum."
And many people got on a

00:18:46.825 --> 00:18:49.319
plateau,
handed to them,

00:18:49.319 --> 00:18:53.061
by the outcome of this war,
of this short war,

00:18:53.061 --> 00:18:56.470
the kind of regime that they
wanted.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.634
What did they want?
Well, I'll talk more about that

00:18:58.634 --> 00:19:01.538
in a minute.
The second kind of event that

00:19:01.538 --> 00:19:06.460
happened is-- this makes me feel
old--my friend Bob Paxton,

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:11.498
who is much older than me,
wrote a book called Vichy

00:19:11.498 --> 00:19:16.349
France, that was published
in English in 1972,

00:19:16.349 --> 00:19:19.839
and en français
in probably '73.

00:19:19.839 --> 00:19:25.291
And Vichy France was
about--it took off the--it cut

00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:31.700
through this sort of intentional
forgetting of what had happened,

00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:35.769
to look at collaboration,
to look at collaboration.

00:19:35.769 --> 00:19:39.688
Now, Bob Paxton did not have
the right to use French

00:19:39.688 --> 00:19:42.509
documents.
Why?

00:19:42.509 --> 00:19:45.026
Archival documents,
the kind that I use studying

00:19:45.026 --> 00:19:46.980
earlier periods.
Why?

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.730
Because there's a fifty-year
rule;

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.952
also, because even when he was
writing on a guy called Georges

00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:56.759
Orez who was sort of an
authoritarian crypto-fascist,

00:19:56.759 --> 00:20:00.288
and who had a lot of influence
in the Seine-et-Marne,

00:20:00.288 --> 00:20:03.748
and in the Loire-et-Cher,
and a lot of departments near

00:20:03.748 --> 00:20:06.556
Paris--he was called a
troublemaker by an archivist

00:20:06.556 --> 00:20:09.140
because he tried to get
documents that would've

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:12.509
implicated lots of very powerful
families--strikebreaking and

00:20:12.509 --> 00:20:15.400
that kind of stuff,
in the 1930s.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.243
But when this book came out it
had a major kind of effect and

00:20:18.243 --> 00:20:20.896
it was followed by a book that
he did with Michael Marrus

00:20:20.896 --> 00:20:22.650
called Vichy and the
Jews,

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:26.049
a story that I will tell just
in part later.

00:20:26.049 --> 00:20:28.924
And this had a huge effect
because suddenly here was this

00:20:28.924 --> 00:20:32.794
American, an American historian,
a great historian saying "it

00:20:32.794 --> 00:20:37.119
wasn't like you learned in
school, it wasn't like that."

00:20:37.119 --> 00:20:40.204
And I remember my wife and I
were in Brusels once,

00:20:40.204 --> 00:20:42.470
and we were in a hotel in
Brusels,

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.922
in Brussels,
and there was this inevitable

00:20:44.922 --> 00:20:48.571
sort of French show where they
bring in six or seven different

00:20:48.571 --> 00:20:51.746
people,
and there were skinhead fascist

00:20:51.746 --> 00:20:56.049
picketers, picketing Paxton's
presence in this show,

00:20:56.049 --> 00:20:57.942
and at one point--it was of
these typical French things

00:20:57.942 --> 00:21:00.079
where they bring in somebody who
had lived through the war,

00:21:00.079 --> 00:21:02.204
somebody who'd read something
about the war,

00:21:02.204 --> 00:21:05.218
and all of that--it was just a
typical machin bidule or

00:21:05.218 --> 00:21:07.589
just this thing they kind of
throw together,

00:21:07.589 --> 00:21:09.241
but at one point this guy gets
up and he said,

00:21:09.241 --> 00:21:10.710
"what could you tell us about
the war?

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.199
You didn't know,
you were only twelve-years-old

00:21:13.199 --> 00:21:15.960
then, during World War Two," or
whatever Bob was.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:18.450
But this book had an enormous
impact.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.152
And the power of this book and
of this man--he was once

00:21:22.152 --> 00:21:26.059
introduced at the Sorbonne as
the conscience of France,

00:21:26.059 --> 00:21:27.902
"Monsieur Paxton,
dans un certain sens,

00:21:27.902 --> 00:21:30.150
vous êtes la conscience
de la France."

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:33.130
That's pretty heavy stuff,
by Jean-Pierre Azéma,

00:21:33.130 --> 00:21:36.007
who's an historian.
And third, really,

00:21:36.007 --> 00:21:39.155
are the trials,
the trials, and as

00:21:39.155 --> 00:21:44.403
collaboration came to be
something that people wanted to

00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:49.109
know about.
What happened to the Jews?

00:21:49.109 --> 00:21:51.895
What happened to the people
that were arrested because they

00:21:51.895 --> 00:21:55.079
were communists?
Who were they arrested by?

00:21:55.079 --> 00:21:57.974
The Germans would've been happy
to do it, but they were arrested

00:21:57.974 --> 00:22:01.547
by the French.
Then they started tracking down

00:22:01.547 --> 00:22:04.660
people with rather bad
histories.

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:08.746
And one of the first was a man
named Touvier,

00:22:08.746 --> 00:22:12.553
t-o-u-v-i-e-r,
and Touvier was involved in

00:22:12.553 --> 00:22:16.664
lots of bad things,
the torture of resisters,

00:22:16.664 --> 00:22:21.086
the arrest and deportation,
the certain death of Jews and

00:22:21.086 --> 00:22:25.302
Communists and people like that.
And Touvier was hidden by

00:22:25.302 --> 00:22:27.683
rightwing Catholic groups--
they're called

00:22:27.683 --> 00:22:31.534
anti-gristes in French.
The role of the church in all

00:22:31.534 --> 00:22:33.869
of this I better get to in
awhile.

00:22:33.869 --> 00:22:36.524
And he was hidden,
he was bounced from monastery

00:22:36.524 --> 00:22:38.670
to monastery in the
Alpes-Maritimes,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.186
above Nice and up in the
Alpes-du-Haute-Provence,

00:22:41.186 --> 00:22:43.598
and he was hidden,
and they finally tracked the

00:22:43.598 --> 00:22:45.904
guy down,
and they put him on trial,

00:22:45.904 --> 00:22:48.585
and he was condemned.
And at this trial,

00:22:48.585 --> 00:22:51.775
and at others,
Paxton became what they call a

00:22:51.775 --> 00:22:55.400
témoin expert,
an expert witness.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.859
Now, that's very important in
French law.

00:22:57.859 --> 00:23:01.032
If you have a lawsuit against
somebody who screwed up your

00:23:01.032 --> 00:23:03.248
house or your apartment,
for bad work,

00:23:03.248 --> 00:23:06.854
they always bring in witnesses
who are experts at carpentry to

00:23:06.854 --> 00:23:09.330
say that they screwed up,
or they didn't screw up,

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:10.869
or at what point they screwed
up, et cetera.

00:23:10.869 --> 00:23:14.224
But here you've got historians,
and historians have a much

00:23:14.224 --> 00:23:17.049
greater public role in France
than in the U.S;

00:23:17.049 --> 00:23:20.819
people care about history much
more than they do in the U.S.

00:23:20.819 --> 00:23:24.503
And, so, Paxton became this
expert witness in the trial of

00:23:24.503 --> 00:23:27.650
Touvier.
And then the trial of Klaus

00:23:27.650 --> 00:23:31.819
Barbie, b-a-r-b-i-e,
who had--Klaus Barbie had

00:23:31.819 --> 00:23:36.281
tortured people in Lyon,
and Klaus Barbie had a lot of

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:40.135
authority when Marc Bloch,
when he was set up and arrested

00:23:40.135 --> 00:23:44.058
on a bridge that goes over the
Sonne and tortured hideously

00:23:44.058 --> 00:23:47.710
north of Lyon in a place called
Colons Mont d'Or.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:53.640
And Klaus Barbie was put on
trial, was brought back.

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:55.950
And Paxton was an expert
witness there too.

00:23:55.950 --> 00:24:00.765
Barbie was confronted,
literally, with now very old

00:24:00.765 --> 00:24:05.870
ladies that he had tortured
himself during the war.

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:08.226
Torture is not a good thing.
The Americans do it too,

00:24:08.226 --> 00:24:10.450
now, and that's not a good
thing, but that's another

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.296
subject.
The Americans didn't used to do

00:24:12.296 --> 00:24:14.720
things like that but they do
things now like that now.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:20.140
But Paxton was an expert
witness in this.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.145
And then there was Papon,
Maurice Papon,

00:24:22.145 --> 00:24:24.869
and you're old enough to maybe
even know who he is.

00:24:24.869 --> 00:24:27.969
Maurice Papon,
he worked in a prefecture in

00:24:27.969 --> 00:24:31.880
the Gironde, in Bordeaux,
and he was a functionary.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:36.025
And Maurice Papon signed the
death certificates essentially

00:24:36.025 --> 00:24:40.527
of, oh, hundreds and hundreds of
Jews who were taken to the Gare

00:24:40.527 --> 00:24:42.261
Saint-Jean,
in Bordeaux,

00:24:42.261 --> 00:24:44.905
and then were transported
toward the death camps,

00:24:44.905 --> 00:24:48.099
Auschwitz, and there's actually
one that was in Alsace,

00:24:48.099 --> 00:24:50.814
the Germans set it up,
and Treblinka,

00:24:50.814 --> 00:24:54.509
and Dachau, and all these
infamous death camps.

00:24:54.509 --> 00:24:58.488
And he went on to a very
successful career in the^(

00:24:58.488 --> 00:25:02.546
)Fourth and Fifth Republic,
a very kind of important

00:25:02.546 --> 00:25:05.111
bureaucrat.
And they caught up to this very

00:25:05.111 --> 00:25:06.994
old man.
Do you put really old people on

00:25:06.994 --> 00:25:09.063
trial?
Well, Pétain was on

00:25:09.063 --> 00:25:12.865
trial after the war and they
allowed him to die on a small

00:25:12.865 --> 00:25:17.000
island off the coast of the
Vendais or the Atlantic island.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.237
And there was even a big uproar
about fifteen years ago when

00:25:20.237 --> 00:25:23.420
there was a reportage or
there was a documentary,

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.927
they had very sort of nice
music and you saw the old man

00:25:25.927 --> 00:25:28.160
penning his letters,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:31.612
And there were various attempts
to steal his bones and bury them

00:25:31.612 --> 00:25:33.453
in Verdun.
But all of this,

00:25:33.453 --> 00:25:37.006
the Vichy syndrome,
this obsession with Vichy was

00:25:37.006 --> 00:25:41.155
accentuated by these trials.
And, so, Maurice Papon was put

00:25:41.155 --> 00:25:44.619
on trial in 1998 and 1999,
and at one point he escapes.

00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:47.679
He was under house-arrest and
he escapes and they arrest him

00:25:47.679 --> 00:25:49.650
in a fine restaurant in
Switzerland,

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.071
which is where he'd gone with
his friends to try to escape the

00:25:53.071 --> 00:25:54.390
trial.
And then the question,

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.439
what do you do with him?
But what he said is,

00:25:56.439 --> 00:26:01.026
"I was a good bureaucrat."
He said, "my supervisors,

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:05.950
my superiors thought I was
excellent."

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.567
And he used that famous
argument that Paxton,

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:11.126
in his book,
Vichy France demolished,

00:26:11.126 --> 00:26:14.745
that is the shield argument;
that is, if it wasn't--and this

00:26:14.745 --> 00:26:18.009
is the thing that the people
defending Pétain used,

00:26:18.009 --> 00:26:22.052
too--that if it wasn't for me,
if it wasn't for we--he always

00:26:22.052 --> 00:26:25.243
used the royal we,
Pétain--that then things

00:26:25.243 --> 00:26:27.563
would've been even worse.
And Papon said,

00:26:27.563 --> 00:26:30.295
"well, if I hadn't signed
this--I was supposed to sign

00:26:30.295 --> 00:26:33.088
certificates,
we were supposed to find out

00:26:33.088 --> 00:26:36.181
who were Jews,
and if I hadn't signed--I only

00:26:36.181 --> 00:26:39.390
signed 400 out of the 600,
or whatever."

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:42.974
Well, n'importe quoi.
But it just was a pathetic

00:26:42.974 --> 00:26:45.633
defense.
And then he was found guilty

00:26:45.633 --> 00:26:49.529
and then they put him in jail,
under very nice conditions,

00:26:49.529 --> 00:26:52.400
for a while,
and then he got very sick.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.600
He just died within the last
year and I think he was ninety

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.592
or something like that.
But these trials were sort of

00:26:59.592 --> 00:27:04.996
the third aspect or the third
key moment, or three of the key

00:27:04.996 --> 00:27:10.039
moments in France coming to
grips with collaboration,

00:27:10.039 --> 00:27:13.792
that not everybody resisted,
and it wasn't just elites who

00:27:13.792 --> 00:27:16.128
collaborated.
By the way, there was another

00:27:16.128 --> 00:27:18.779
guy who was going to go on
trial, a guy called Bousquet,

00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:26.997
who was the head of--he was one
of the heads of the police in

00:27:26.997 --> 00:27:31.486
Paris, during Vichy.
And he was supposed to go on

00:27:31.486 --> 00:27:34.491
trial but he was murdered by
this crazy guy who thought by

00:27:34.491 --> 00:27:37.180
killing him he'd give publicity
to his own book,

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.859
he'd written this sort of bad
book.

00:27:38.859 --> 00:27:41.820
And, so, he went to Bousquet's
apartment and guns him down

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.885
before he could go on trial,
so unfortunately Bousquet never

00:27:44.885 --> 00:27:48.248
went on trial.
So, from having no official

00:27:48.248 --> 00:27:52.205
memory of Vichy,
no--but only sites of memory

00:27:52.205 --> 00:27:56.972
that had to do with the
resistance--which I'm going to

00:27:56.972 --> 00:28:00.390
talk about next time--that
since,

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:05.184
before you were born,
but France underwent this

00:28:05.184 --> 00:28:10.916
re-evaluation--and that was
important for people who had

00:28:10.916 --> 00:28:15.190
lost family members because of
Vichy.

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:22.525
It was important for Jews;
some 75,000 Jews never came

00:28:22.525 --> 00:28:25.254
back to France.
They tried, of course,

00:28:25.254 --> 00:28:27.697
at the beginning--and they did
this in Bulgaria too,

00:28:27.697 --> 00:28:30.904
and in Hungary.
They'd first go arrest the

00:28:30.904 --> 00:28:34.150
foreign Jews,
not assimilated Jews.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:39.044
So, the big roundup in July of
1942, the rafle,

00:28:39.044 --> 00:28:42.368
that's the French
word--rafle,

00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:45.877
sort of sweep,
in the Marais and on Ile

00:28:45.877 --> 00:28:48.844
Saint-Louis.
It was not done by the Germans

00:28:48.844 --> 00:28:50.539
who would've been very happy to
do it.

00:28:50.539 --> 00:28:53.430
They didn't care,
they'd do it--it was done by

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:56.450
the French, it was done by the
French police.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.436
And really, one of the worst
institutions was of course the

00:28:59.436 --> 00:29:00.930
milice,
the militia;

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:03.275
the militia,
m-i-l-i-c-e,

00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:07.476
the militia,
who are created in January 1943

00:29:07.476 --> 00:29:11.584
to get tough on the Jews,
get tough on the resistors,

00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:13.803
get tough on the
communists--and these were some

00:29:13.803 --> 00:29:15.549
of the worst of the
collaborators.

00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:18.551
In the Papon trial it came out,
they interviewed various people

00:29:18.551 --> 00:29:21.019
who'd been in prison--they were
very old by then,

00:29:21.019 --> 00:29:25.106
obviously--who had been in
prison then in Bordeaux,

00:29:25.106 --> 00:29:28.866
around Bordeaux,
and they actually brought some

00:29:28.866 --> 00:29:32.339
German soldiers back there,
too.

00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:36.818
And one of them testified--I
remember this--he said if we had

00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:40.380
a guy, un gars,
a guy who we picked up in a

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.789
sweep and he was a resister,
or he was a communist,

00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:46.466
or something like that,
if we kind of liked the guy,

00:29:46.466 --> 00:29:49.457
and you get on with him after a
couple of days when you're

00:29:49.457 --> 00:29:51.927
guarding him,
and you find things in common

00:29:51.927 --> 00:29:55.301
that you have--often that wasn't
the case--that if we wanted to

00:29:55.301 --> 00:29:58.620
save him from hideous torture we
didn't give him to the French

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.960
militia because of what they
would do.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.828
But, of course,
by 1943--more about this

00:30:02.828 --> 00:30:05.655
later--but there was a case near
us where this woman who had

00:30:05.655 --> 00:30:08.824
denounced a couple of resisters,
and she had--was an open

00:30:08.824 --> 00:30:12.496
collaborator and she was--she
lived up in the northern part of

00:30:12.496 --> 00:30:14.954
Ardèche,
and she walked across the

00:30:14.954 --> 00:30:18.420
bridge across the Rhone one day
to go shopping on the other side

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.121
of the river,
in the Drôme,

00:30:20.121 --> 00:30:22.543
and some people came up behind
her and put a bullet right

00:30:22.543 --> 00:30:24.359
through her head and blew her
head off.

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:28.430
And collaborators had to really
decide what they were up to.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:31.611
And of course a lot of them,
something like 10,000 were

00:30:31.611 --> 00:30:34.910
executed almost immediately in
the days after the war.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.451
But for people--maybe I
mentioned this the first day

00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:40.440
when I was trying to tell you
about one of the things that we

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.430
do--but for people like my
friend who couldn't remember,

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:46.934
but his brother could remember
the day that the Germans,

00:30:46.934 --> 00:30:49.609
in this case,
came into a French suburb,

00:30:49.609 --> 00:30:52.225
a place called Le
Perreux-sur-Marne and took his

00:30:52.225 --> 00:30:56.289
father who was part Jewish,
who was Greek and took him away.

00:30:56.289 --> 00:30:59.246
The Nazis came to get him and
he was denounced by a French

00:30:59.246 --> 00:31:01.800
policeman for being Jewish.
And letters of denunciation

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.667
were all over the place,
and he wrote a letter of

00:31:03.667 --> 00:31:06.019
denunciation.
Those are big costs.

00:31:06.019 --> 00:31:08.774
You're not saying so-and-so is
watering their lawn too much,

00:31:08.774 --> 00:31:11.436
as they're doing in Atlanta,
which is--it's a bad thing to

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:13.291
water your lawn.
But there was this reportage I

00:31:13.291 --> 00:31:14.795
saw the other day about
everybody turning in their

00:31:14.795 --> 00:31:16.299
neighbors because they're
watering their lawn.

00:31:16.299 --> 00:31:18.704
But you write something to the
French militia saying

00:31:18.704 --> 00:31:20.779
so-and-so's a Jew,
you're selling out- you're

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:23.470
selling their life away;
or so-and-so's a communist,

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.425
or so-and-so's a resistor.
And for this guy,

00:31:26.425 --> 00:31:31.369
his father was taken away with
a wife after the war.

00:31:31.369 --> 00:31:34.789
Every Saturday when she went to
the market she saw the same

00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:37.972
policeman directing traffic
there who had denounced her

00:31:37.972 --> 00:31:40.463
husband,
who was responsible,

00:31:40.463 --> 00:31:44.564
in a personal way,
not just sort of an indirect

00:31:44.564 --> 00:31:49.200
way, a personal way for the
death of her husband.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.420
And for people like that there
was sort of a satisfaction.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.824
You can well imagine.
Even if you're not somebody

00:31:55.824 --> 00:31:59.855
like, somebody of vengeance;
I would've gone--spent years

00:31:59.855 --> 00:32:05.180
tracking these people down.
But she wasn't like that.

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:09.049
But there would be a moment of
vindication when the textbooks

00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:11.660
begin to change.
That's something, too.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.956
My kids are in seconde
in France, and the textbooks,

00:32:14.956 --> 00:32:18.422
really, now they're starting to
change about the way the whole

00:32:18.422 --> 00:32:20.723
period was covered.
But that's something that comes

00:32:20.723 --> 00:32:23.785
out of this.
So, histories have their

00:32:23.785 --> 00:32:27.694
histories as well.
And the next history,

00:32:27.694 --> 00:32:32.704
by the way--and not to sort of
leap ahead--that was sort of

00:32:32.704 --> 00:32:36.851
unveiled will be,
of course, the Algerian War and

00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:39.961
all of that.
And the same kind of talk shows

00:32:39.961 --> 00:32:43.032
that they're beginning to-that
they've had now for the last

00:32:43.032 --> 00:32:45.309
fifteen years on French TV all
the time,

00:32:45.309 --> 00:32:48.263
and documentaries they never
would have shown before will

00:32:48.263 --> 00:32:50.690
start to happen,
about the Algerian War too.

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:53.511
And also for those generations
passing away,

00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:56.990
it's important for them to talk
about these things;

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:59.468
and you're not in the situation
as I described in the case of

00:32:59.468 --> 00:33:02.406
World War One,
there's only one single former

00:33:02.406 --> 00:33:06.960
soldier who was in World War One
is still alive in Britain.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.618
If you saw the Ken Burns thing
about World War Two,

00:33:09.618 --> 00:33:12.329
they did a lot of interviews
with people now they're

00:33:12.329 --> 00:33:13.927
eighty-four,
eighty-five,

00:33:13.927 --> 00:33:16.419
eighty-six or
eighty-two--extraordinarily

00:33:16.419 --> 00:33:20.172
lucid.
So, there's lots more that can

00:33:20.172 --> 00:33:22.854
be done.
Now, what did people who

00:33:22.854 --> 00:33:25.503
collaborated want?
First of all,

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:29.651
just quelques mots at
the beginning,

00:33:29.651 --> 00:33:34.919
a few things at the beginning.
Whereas in voting Left in

00:33:34.919 --> 00:33:39.099
France--you could do a map and
place a map on that,

00:33:39.099 --> 00:33:41.687
and place it on a map of
de-Christianization,

00:33:41.687 --> 00:33:45.039
and the French Revolution,
and the elections of 1849--I've

00:33:45.039 --> 00:33:48.508
said this before--and there'd be
a remarkable similarity and

00:33:48.508 --> 00:33:52.160
hardly any changes at all.
That's not true in terms of

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.109
collaboration,
nor is it true in resistance.

00:33:55.109 --> 00:33:58.790
Collaborators didn't come from
one certain region as opposed to

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.640
another, which is largely the
case in Belgium.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:04.789
There were collaborators
everywhere.

00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:08.429
They don't come from one social
class, either.

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:12.388
Now, in one of the haunting
images of--in this film,

00:34:12.388 --> 00:34:16.560
The Sorrow and the Pity,
there's a guy called Christian

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.030
de la Mazière,
who's of noble vintage,

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:22.318
and he's interviewed in a
smoking,

00:34:22.318 --> 00:34:26.099
this sort of smoking jacket,
in his chateau.

00:34:26.099 --> 00:34:28.870
And he's very bright and he's
very articulate,

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:32.071
and he describes why he
liked--why he was happy to go

00:34:32.071 --> 00:34:35.150
and fight along the Nazi
soldiers in the east,

00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:38.020
in what was called the Waffen
SS, these divisions.

00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:40.350
And he's so articulate.
And you think,

00:34:40.350 --> 00:34:42.620
how can a smart guy like that
ever do these things?

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.070
How can he hate Jews?
How can he want to see them die?

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:49.708
How can he want to see
communists put up against the

00:34:49.708 --> 00:34:53.514
wall and gunned down?
Working-class guys from the

00:34:53.514 --> 00:34:56.400
Nord or peasants from the
Auvergne.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.824
And he explains it.
Now, you're more apt to have

00:34:59.824 --> 00:35:03.226
upper-class people collaborate,
just as in the attraction of

00:35:03.226 --> 00:35:06.442
National Socialism in Germany,
it's the middle classes that

00:35:06.442 --> 00:35:09.559
ago that way first;
and it's true in France in the

00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:12.479
1930s as well.
But you can't make any--there

00:35:12.479 --> 00:35:15.570
were working-class people
collaborators as well.

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:17.680
You can't make any of these
kinds of generalizations.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.257
What about religion?
Now, the role of the Pope in

00:35:21.257 --> 00:35:25.245
all of this is nauseating.
The Pope knew,

00:35:25.245 --> 00:35:28.516
he did nothing,
he did zero,

00:35:28.516 --> 00:35:32.755
zero,
nothing, and they knew,

00:35:32.755 --> 00:35:36.453
he knew.
When Roosevelt and these people

00:35:36.453 --> 00:35:40.151
knew also, is that they knew
earlier and they didn't do

00:35:40.151 --> 00:35:42.767
anything about it.
There's various reasons they

00:35:42.767 --> 00:35:45.248
didn't bomb the death camps,
but if you bomb the death camps

00:35:45.248 --> 00:35:47.645
then you're killing a lot of
people in the death camps and

00:35:47.645 --> 00:35:50.340
all of that.
It's not so easy.

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.773
But the Catholic Church,
the church hierarchy generally

00:35:52.773 --> 00:35:55.804
was extremely collaborationist,
because--but the Bishop of

00:35:55.804 --> 00:35:59.248
Toulouse was a very heroic guy
who in his sermons would say

00:35:59.248 --> 00:36:02.731
"leave these people alone."
And the Bishop of Aldi,

00:36:02.731 --> 00:36:06.060
which is about a forty-five
minute drive away,

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.760
to the northeast,
was a notorious collaborator.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.380
Also I'll talk more about
priests.

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:17.949
Priests are community leaders
in many parts of France.

00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:22.246
Some of them were happy to see
the Germans come and some of

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:24.838
them were not,
and some of them were

00:36:24.838 --> 00:36:27.949
collaborators and some of them
didn't.

00:36:27.949 --> 00:36:29.960
And some of them got theirs
after the war.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.713
There was a priest in a village
near us and he had had

00:36:33.713 --> 00:36:37.821
Déat, who was a notorious
fascist, into this sort of

00:36:37.821 --> 00:36:41.090
public reception and all that.
In 1944, August,

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:43.996
up against the wall--you can
still see the bullet holes

00:36:43.996 --> 00:36:47.440
there, where they gunned them
down, people that collaborated.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.380
A village near Limoges--I've
spent a lot of time in Limoges.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.409
There's a place called--where
is it, there's a bike guy from

00:36:54.409 --> 00:36:56.104
there, Poulidor,
Raymond Poulidor,

00:36:56.104 --> 00:36:58.207
Saint-Leonarde.
In Saint-Leonarde,

00:36:58.207 --> 00:37:00.400
in 1944, August,
they're partying.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.554
Someone says,
"where's the gendarme that sold

00:37:02.554 --> 00:37:04.170
these people away,
where is he?

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:07.657
He's got an aunt in Limoges."
A friend of mine,

00:37:07.657 --> 00:37:09.824
a former, a guy I knew from the
archives, a

00:37:09.824 --> 00:37:11.785
gardien--well,
he was my friend,

00:37:11.785 --> 00:37:14.519
he was my compagnon,
as he would call me.

00:37:14.519 --> 00:37:18.349
And he saw this because he was
a refugee from Lorraine.

00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:19.889
Somebody said,
"where is the guy?"

00:37:19.889 --> 00:37:22.974
"The guy's in,
the f-guy is there,

00:37:22.974 --> 00:37:26.777
he's in Limoges."
So, they stop partying,

00:37:26.777 --> 00:37:31.980
they walk to Limoges--nobody
had cars or gas--they go to the

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:34.889
aunt's house,
he's there, bam;

00:37:34.889 --> 00:37:37.244
and they put him at the head of
this procession,

00:37:37.244 --> 00:37:39.498
a cortège,
and they're all shouting and

00:37:39.498 --> 00:37:41.465
singing,
and they--before they're going

00:37:41.465 --> 00:37:43.739
to party they put him against
the wall and brrrk,

00:37:43.739 --> 00:37:45.389
like that, and that's the end
of that.

00:37:45.389 --> 00:37:48.424
So, these things evoked very
strong memories for these

00:37:48.424 --> 00:37:50.338
people.
But the church's role--the

00:37:50.338 --> 00:37:53.190
church got what it wanted,
in many ways--no divorce.

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:56.428
There were two people executed
for abortion,

00:37:56.428 --> 00:37:59.591
actually, only two,
but still that's a lot,

00:37:59.591 --> 00:38:03.546
for practicing abortion;
no divorce, et cetera,

00:38:03.546 --> 00:38:07.710
et cetera.
But that's not the only story.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.503
There were people who moved
from the Catholic Left into the

00:38:10.503 --> 00:38:12.514
resistance.
Many of them joined the

00:38:12.514 --> 00:38:15.880
Communist Party subsequently.
But anyway, it's not that open

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:19.727
and shut.
But what do these people want,

00:38:19.727 --> 00:38:23.846
who were collaborators?
Here's a couple of scenes,

00:38:23.846 --> 00:38:27.387
a bunch of scenes.
First of all the argument that

00:38:27.387 --> 00:38:32.672
Pétain made after the war
was that-- again it's the shield

00:38:32.672 --> 00:38:36.801
argument--is that by
collaborating with the Germans

00:38:36.801 --> 00:38:40.269
you were preserving the French
State.

00:38:40.269 --> 00:38:43.323
But as Paxton said,
with amazing eloquence,

00:38:43.323 --> 00:38:47.250
he said, "they may have saved
the French State but they

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:51.384
destroyed the French nation."
What does the French nation

00:38:51.384 --> 00:38:53.363
mean?
Liberty, equality,

00:38:53.363 --> 00:38:58.056
fraternity--not patrie,
and work, and all that,

00:38:58.056 --> 00:39:01.686
God, et cetera,
that they put on the coins

00:39:01.686 --> 00:39:04.536
during Vichy.
But they would say,

00:39:04.536 --> 00:39:08.042
"we are maintaining the
innocence--the independence of

00:39:08.042 --> 00:39:10.579
France."
And the innocence--that was the

00:39:10.579 --> 00:39:14.197
right slip there--the innocence
of France, because the view had

00:39:14.197 --> 00:39:17.698
to be that we were martyred by
the loss of autonomy and we'll

00:39:17.698 --> 00:39:20.500
get it back by doing what the
Germans want,

00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:23.349
by helping them rebuild
economically.

00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:26.114
The Germans wanted to take
industrial, convert it to war

00:39:26.114 --> 00:39:28.880
use and that kind of thing--
we'll do what they want.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:32.321
So, that's one theme.
But the shield argument has

00:39:32.321 --> 00:39:35.957
pretty much been denounced.
Second, xenophobia,

00:39:35.957 --> 00:39:40.981
that the xenophobia that
characterized the French Right

00:39:40.981 --> 00:39:44.954
in the 1920s and 1930s;
the racism and xenophobia

00:39:44.954 --> 00:39:49.308
became State policy.
The foreign Jews were shipped

00:39:49.308 --> 00:39:54.670
off, but also lots of
quote/unquote "French Jews."

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:56.223
I'm not making that
differentiation,

00:39:56.223 --> 00:39:59.587
this is one that they made.
Actually, there's a hotel

00:39:59.587 --> 00:40:03.909
called Lutétia,
which is a very fancy hotel,

00:40:03.909 --> 00:40:06.388
at Sèvres-Babylon,
and that was a place where

00:40:06.388 --> 00:40:09.059
people came after the war,
when Jews came back.

00:40:09.059 --> 00:40:10.557
If you made it back,
you went there,

00:40:10.557 --> 00:40:12.995
you went there every damn day
to see if somebody from your

00:40:12.995 --> 00:40:15.373
family was coming back;
and most of them didn't come

00:40:15.373 --> 00:40:16.989
back, most of them didn't come
back.

00:40:16.989 --> 00:40:20.557
But the xenophobia was no
Italians, no Spanish,

00:40:20.557 --> 00:40:24.280
especially communists--again
the fear of Marxism,

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:28.503
et cetera, et cetera.
They put the Spanish refugees

00:40:28.503 --> 00:40:32.519
in camps, the Republic had,
the Popular Front had,

00:40:32.519 --> 00:40:34.652
at the end of the Popular
Front, and camps up in the

00:40:34.652 --> 00:40:36.199
Pyrén&amp;eac
ute;es-Orientales,

00:40:36.199 --> 00:40:40.516
between Perpignan and the sea,
places like Argeles and all of

00:40:40.516 --> 00:40:43.334
that.
That was what was given to them

00:40:43.334 --> 00:40:47.738
on the plateau--on the
platter, is to make xenophobia

00:40:47.738 --> 00:40:52.116
part of state policy.
Third, and this is a subset but

00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:55.869
it should stand by itself,
is anti-Semitism,

00:40:55.869 --> 00:41:00.370
that the French Vichy
regime--let me interject the

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:06.064
fact that it's only in November
of 1942 that the Germans occupy

00:41:06.064 --> 00:41:11.202
the Vichy zone,
because the resistance is

00:41:11.202 --> 00:41:18.260
mobilizing--that the French put
in laws about Jews,

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:23.414
depriving Jews of rights that
the Germans didn't even ask them

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:26.655
to do, in terms of saying,
"well, if you are Jewish

00:41:26.655 --> 00:41:28.991
because your grandmother or your
grandfather was Jewish"--I don't

00:41:28.991 --> 00:41:32.415
remember exactly the laws.
But the laws in some ways are

00:41:32.415 --> 00:41:37.309
even harsher than the infamous
Nuremberg laws of the Reich.

00:41:37.309 --> 00:41:43.085
They put in even harsher laws,
and they did it because they

00:41:43.085 --> 00:41:49.159
wanted to, not because the
Germans were saying you do this;

00:41:49.159 --> 00:41:53.953
"better Hitler than Blum," and
that's the way that Vichy wanted

00:41:53.953 --> 00:41:57.199
it, that's the way that Vichy
wanted it.

00:41:57.199 --> 00:42:01.197
And as the Jews disappeared,
as they disappeared to Drancy

00:42:01.197 --> 00:42:04.845
and to these other places,
how many priests said--and

00:42:04.845 --> 00:42:09.477
again I'm not being provocative;
and I went to a Jesuit school,

00:42:09.477 --> 00:42:13.340
for better or for worse--"there
go the Christ-killers,

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:17.192
there they go," in the little
trains bouncing along,

00:42:17.192 --> 00:42:20.289
off to Drancy and then off to
the camp.

00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:23.420
So, anti-Semitism becomes
official policy.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.719
Pétain was a notorious
anti-Semite.

00:42:25.719 --> 00:42:28.829
The High Command of the French
Army was replete with

00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:31.389
anti-Semitism,
had always been that way.

00:42:31.389 --> 00:42:34.393
Alfred Dreyfus,
it was better that one Jew

00:42:34.393 --> 00:42:38.496
perish or die in Devil's Island
than it was that the army

00:42:38.496 --> 00:42:41.280
be--that its honor be
compromised.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.432
That's the way they viewed it;
it was supported by the

00:42:43.432 --> 00:42:45.269
assumptionists and all these
other people.

00:42:45.269 --> 00:42:49.889
So, that's an important point
as well.

00:42:49.889 --> 00:42:53.668
But there are other themes,
too, that if you read things

00:42:53.668 --> 00:42:57.115
that they wrote at the time,
that the collaborators wrote,

00:42:57.115 --> 00:42:59.409
if you read the proclamations
of Pétain,

00:42:59.409 --> 00:43:04.101
if you read the kind of
spin--they didn't call it that

00:43:04.101 --> 00:43:07.994
then--around the Marshall,
who was always supposed to be

00:43:07.994 --> 00:43:10.139
described as walking with a
sprightly step;

00:43:10.139 --> 00:43:12.776
it was rather like when they
were trying to describe Reagan

00:43:12.776 --> 00:43:15.139
who at the end of his reign was
totally out of it,

00:43:15.139 --> 00:43:18.191
and he's always supposed to be
described--I'm not comparing

00:43:18.191 --> 00:43:21.877
Reagan to Pétain,
but there you're talking about

00:43:21.877 --> 00:43:25.794
very old people.
But he's always supposed to be

00:43:25.794 --> 00:43:29.268
described in a way that he,
his personal,

00:43:29.268 --> 00:43:32.499
his body,
his being represents what the

00:43:32.499 --> 00:43:35.670
Right considered to be wrong
with France;

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:39.592
that he was a dictator,
he was an authoritarian,

00:43:39.592 --> 00:43:42.429
finished the France of
aperitif,

00:43:42.429 --> 00:43:46.026
finished the France of
quarreling fragments or factions

00:43:46.026 --> 00:43:48.489
in the Chambre des
Deputées.

00:43:48.489 --> 00:43:52.140
And, so, by the way the
fascists, the role of the actual

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.989
fascists, it's rather similar to
what happened in Spain,

00:43:55.989 --> 00:43:58.030
but I don't have time to do
this now, but the Phalange in

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.804
Spain were the real fascists,
and they're kind of kept at an

00:44:01.804 --> 00:44:05.498
arm's length by Franco.
The real fascists in all of

00:44:05.498 --> 00:44:08.946
this, not the authoritarian
Right ones but--and they share a

00:44:08.946 --> 00:44:11.015
lot in common,
all the themes I'm talking

00:44:11.015 --> 00:44:13.496
about were shared by both of
them--but they were kind of kept

00:44:13.496 --> 00:44:15.730
at an arm's length in Paris and
this kind of stuff.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:20.344
But anyway, decadence that
Vichy is going to be an answer

00:44:20.344 --> 00:44:23.590
to decadence.
Drieu de la Rochelle said,

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:27.766
"I am a Fascist because I have
measured the progress of

00:44:27.766 --> 00:44:32.097
decadence in Europe and I
believe--I've seen that fascism

00:44:32.097 --> 00:44:36.659
is the only means of limiting
and reducing decadence."

00:44:36.659 --> 00:44:41.099
And this is a term that kind of
comes up over and over again.

00:44:41.099 --> 00:44:45.321
Second, the church--I've
already said that--but that give

00:44:45.321 --> 00:44:49.769
France--there are all sorts of
conversions of the prayer,

00:44:49.769 --> 00:44:51.710
the Our Father,
in the Catholic Church.

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.507
I don't know if it was in the
Protestant churches too,

00:44:53.507 --> 00:44:55.440
whatever--"Our Father who art
in heaven," and all that;

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:59.842
on earth, so that we may live.
Give us our day,

00:44:59.842 --> 00:45:02.865
our daily bread.
Give France back her life,

00:45:02.865 --> 00:45:06.140
et cetera, et cetera;
that the answer to the

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:10.465
decadence of France is going to
be to refine those old Christian

00:45:10.465 --> 00:45:13.459
Catholic values,
associated with Joan of Arc,

00:45:13.459 --> 00:45:17.380
by the way, the sort of revival
of fanaticism about Joan of Arc,

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:22.599
and that this is an important
part of the whole thing;

00:45:22.599 --> 00:45:25.000
that it would be returned to
moral order.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.639
Remember the Government of the
Moral Order of the 1870s.

00:45:30.639 --> 00:45:35.032
It's a return to moral order,
when things are passed down

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:38.954
from moral authorities
represented by the church in

00:45:38.954 --> 00:45:42.704
conjunction with Pétain.
So, it's sort of like a

00:45:42.704 --> 00:45:44.980
monarchy, really.
But, so, the role of religion

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.860
and of church and all of this is
going to be important.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.370
The Boy Scouts,
for example,

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:55.485
scouting has always had very
close ties in France to the

00:45:55.485 --> 00:45:58.740
Catholic Church,
and it's still very

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.451
controversial there now.
Third, nationalism,

00:46:03.451 --> 00:46:09.317
that if you've just been blown
away in yet another--not yet

00:46:09.317 --> 00:46:11.501
another,
not World War One,

00:46:11.501 --> 00:46:14.062
it was not a rapid defeat,
it was a victory,

00:46:14.062 --> 00:46:16.920
a long victory--but as in
1870/1871 that France's

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.731
independence is that of a nation
whose image has been transformed

00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:24.048
away from liberty,
fraternity, equality--the hell

00:46:24.048 --> 00:46:26.608
with all of that,
from their point of view,

00:46:26.608 --> 00:46:29.960
into this world of order and
work and patrie,

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:35.079
religion;
patrie goes on the coins.

00:46:35.079 --> 00:46:37.560
And in doing that,
in saying that,

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.469
this nationalism becomes one
that is exclusionary.

00:46:41.469 --> 00:46:43.431
That's one of the
characteristics of these

00:46:43.431 --> 00:46:45.250
rightwing movements all over
Europe.

00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:50.236
Hitler says--or the mayor of
Vienna said, "I decide who's a

00:46:50.236 --> 00:46:53.590
Jew"--this in the 1890s--Hitler
says,

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:56.949
"we will determine who's a Jew
and then we will kill them."

00:46:56.949 --> 00:47:01.247
And then Pétain,
who's very happy to see the

00:47:01.247 --> 00:47:06.473
Jews go, he could've cared less;
Pétain's the hero of

00:47:06.473 --> 00:47:10.397
Verdun, and so there's no room
in the Pantheon,

00:47:10.397 --> 00:47:14.177
not of the Republic,
but of the Marshall,

00:47:14.177 --> 00:47:18.450
for Jews--that's part of the
nationalist method,

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:22.760
message and method,
of this--it's there.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:28.791
Next, well authority, authority;
authority comes top down--I'm

00:47:28.791 --> 00:47:31.874
kind of repeating myself but you
get the point--authority comes

00:47:31.874 --> 00:47:34.267
from top down.
It doesn't come from people

00:47:34.267 --> 00:47:36.446
elected to represent the
Haute-Garonne,

00:47:36.446 --> 00:47:39.390
Toulouse's region,
and sitting in the Palais

00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:43.499
Bourbon, in the political club,
authority comes from the top

00:47:43.499 --> 00:47:47.072
down--this is the 1920s,
'30s and '40s--and that's what

00:47:47.072 --> 00:47:48.989
they viewed as a very good
thing.

00:47:48.989 --> 00:47:53.589
Next peasantism,
that "true France" is what they

00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:57.699
called it, true France,
the real France,

00:47:57.699 --> 00:48:00.201
not the France of Jews,
not the France of

00:48:00.201 --> 00:48:02.390
grèves--no
strikes,

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:06.292
strikes are illegal.
Not the France of working class

00:48:06.292 --> 00:48:10.157
organizations,
no CGT, organized workers need

00:48:10.157 --> 00:48:14.285
not apply, need not exist,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:48:14.285 --> 00:48:18.738
and all of this.
Virtue is found in the soil,

00:48:18.738 --> 00:48:24.141
and Joan of Arc who's a peasant
girl from--I've been to her

00:48:24.141 --> 00:48:26.436
house,
or what they claim is her

00:48:26.436 --> 00:48:29.057
house, in the Meuse and in the
east of France,

00:48:29.057 --> 00:48:32.610
she becomes a symbol of not
only of sort this nationalism,

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:36.074
chasing away the Brits and all
of this before she's burned in

00:48:36.074 --> 00:48:39.801
Rouen--or the English,
they weren't British then--but

00:48:39.801 --> 00:48:44.250
becomes virtue in herself of
being attached to the soil;

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:46.911
that cities are places where
Jews hang out,

00:48:46.911 --> 00:48:50.269
cities are places where
organized workers hang out,

00:48:50.269 --> 00:48:55.300
and that the true France is
that of peasants and the soil.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:59.675
And, so, these groups like the
chantiers de la jeunesse,

00:48:59.675 --> 00:49:03.839
which are the sort of workshops
or work areas of youth where

00:49:03.839 --> 00:49:07.510
they're supposed to get up early
in the morning;

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.162
instead of smoking a pack of
Gauloises before noon,

00:49:10.162 --> 00:49:12.603
they're supposed to get
up--which is a terrible

00:49:12.603 --> 00:49:15.893
thing--they're supposed to get
up and not drink apéro at

00:49:15.893 --> 00:49:17.825
11:30,
but are supposed to maybe go

00:49:17.825 --> 00:49:20.000
running a little,
and collapse wheezing along,

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.136
and then jump into some pond
like the Nazis did--were

00:49:23.136 --> 00:49:25.550
supposed to do that in the
Pomeranian,

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:30.061
frozen Pomeranian lakes,
that this is learning about the

00:49:30.061 --> 00:49:35.147
true France which is this--the
decline of France is going to be

00:49:35.147 --> 00:49:39.275
putting people back on the soil,
putting them to work,

00:49:39.275 --> 00:49:41.455
and all that.
And then there's finally--and

00:49:41.455 --> 00:49:44.102
then I'm going to have to stop,
but I'm basically done--

00:49:44.102 --> 00:49:46.842
there's this corporatism,
which was mostly just window

00:49:46.842 --> 00:49:49.377
dressing.
It's corporatism--they'd read

00:49:49.377 --> 00:49:53.802
something about Italian fascism,
and Mussolini tries to organize

00:49:53.802 --> 00:49:56.998
industries hierarchically,
making the argument that

00:49:56.998 --> 00:49:59.846
workers and bosses who are in,
say, metallurgical production

00:49:59.846 --> 00:50:02.570
have the same interests,
which of course is ridiculous.

00:50:02.570 --> 00:50:05.110
But if you organize things
corporately speaking you won't

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.880
have strikes because they're
illegal,

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.677
and then if you get people to
buy into the nation the way that

00:50:09.677 --> 00:50:11.428
many German workers did,
but not all,

00:50:11.428 --> 00:50:14.128
then you will solve your social
problems and you won't have

00:50:14.128 --> 00:50:16.170
anybody,
everybody will get up and be

00:50:16.170 --> 00:50:19.559
chanting--saying their prayers
in the morning on their knees,

00:50:19.559 --> 00:50:21.730
and schools,
the Marianne is gone from the

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:26.101
walls, the crucifixes are there,
and you will have this happy

00:50:26.101 --> 00:50:31.519
vision, one that the good
fortune, as they believed in it,

00:50:31.519 --> 00:50:37.211
of France's--the decadent
France's defeat by all these

00:50:37.211 --> 00:50:43.010
strong, marching Teutonic
warriors who had given France

00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:48.380
the possibly of creating this
brave new world,

00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:50.877
without communists,
without Jews,

00:50:50.877 --> 00:50:53.219
without gays,
without abortion,

00:50:53.219 --> 00:50:56.619
without strikes,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:50:56.619 --> 00:50:59.603
But it didn't work out that
way, happily,

00:50:59.603 --> 00:51:03.183
and by--as I said,
by the end of 1943 if you woke

00:51:03.183 --> 00:51:07.509
up and you saw a K had been
written on your door you better

00:51:07.509 --> 00:51:11.090
get your toothbrush and get
ready to move,

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:13.839
because things began to change.
And why they begin to change,

00:51:13.839 --> 00:51:16.197
and the origins of the
resistance, and who resisted is

00:51:16.197 --> 00:51:19.396
a fascinating topic,
and that's the one we're gonna

00:51:19.396 --> 00:51:22.734
do next Monday,
I'm going to New Mexico between

00:51:22.734 --> 00:51:26.000
then and now but I will see you
on Monday.

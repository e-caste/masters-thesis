00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.290
Prof: Okay, good morning.
 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.633
We're going to make the
transition today to talking

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:09.295
about Marxism,
the second of the three

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:13.207
Enlightenment traditions that
we're going to consider in the

00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:15.130
first part of this course.
 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.289
And I should warn you at the
outset that I have something of

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.650
a heterodox view of Marx.
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:30.003
I have something of a heterodox
view of Marx in that if you went

00:00:30.003 --> 00:00:36.189
and read, for instance,
there's a book by a man called

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:40.232
Graeme Duncan
 called Marx and

00:00:40.232 --> 00:00:40.980
Mill.
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.144
He basically,
his story line is that Marx and

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:50.160
Mill operate with fundamentally
opposed paradigms,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.930
paradigms meaning foundational
assumptions,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.964
so that Marx and Mill make
completely incommensurable and

00:00:59.964 --> 00:01:04.819
incompatible assumptions about
how the world works,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:10.030
and the political theory that
can flow from those assumptions.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.230
And so to some extent they are,
he thinks on all the big

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.500
questions, speaking past one
another.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.260
That they're basically you
can't adjudicate,

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.105
if you like,
the disagreements between them

00:01:24.105 --> 00:01:27.221
in part because he thinks
they're speaking from

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:29.659
fundamentally opposed paradigms.
 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.659
I think that view couldn't be
more wrongheaded.

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.530
Marx and Mill are creatures of
the Enlightenment,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.700
both, and therefore we will
find in examining Marx,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.191
that just like all of the
utilitarians we've already

00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:48.873
considered so far,
they're both committed to

00:01:48.873 --> 00:01:54.440
basing politics on a scientific
theory of human association,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:01.123
and to committing themselves to
individual freedom as the basic

00:02:01.123 --> 00:02:05.760
and most important principle of
politics.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:16.508
 
 

00:02:16.508 --> 00:02:20.614
Now, so let's,
before we get into the details

00:02:20.614 --> 00:02:25.557
of Marx's own argument,
let's say a few general things

00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:29.568
about Marx as an Enlightenment
thinker.

00:02:29.568 --> 00:02:34.116
And if we think about the
Enlightenment thinkers first of

00:02:34.116 --> 00:02:38.664
all as committed to science
there's no question that Marx

00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:42.970
was committed to a scientific
theory of politics.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.149
If you read his attack on
Proudhon and the utopian

00:02:47.149 --> 00:02:51.841
socialists, for example,
it was all about attacking them

00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.680
for being unscientific in their
thinking.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.205
It was all about rejecting
sentimentalism or wishful

00:03:00.205 --> 00:03:05.705
thinking in trying to understand
what was feasible and what was

00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:08.280
not feasible in politics.
 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.479
So Marx has a scientific
conception.

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.355
Of course it doesn't come
within a country mile of the

00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:19.670
scientific conceptions we saw
both among early Enlightenment

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.805
theorists like Bentham,
or mature Enlightenment

00:03:23.805 --> 00:03:25.710
theorists like Mill.
 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.830
Rather, Marx is committed to
something called the materialist

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.878
conception of history.
 

00:03:32.878 --> 00:03:38.318
And the materialist conception
of history is the idea that,

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:47.180
to use another one of his
rather impenetrable phrases,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.860
he's committed to the idea of
dialectical materialism.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.230
You might say,
"Well, what is dialectical

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.729
materialism?"
 

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:00.842
This comes from the idea first
articulated by a German

00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:05.110
philosopher called Hegel that
history moves in a kind of

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.438
zigzag of fits and starts.
 

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:13.342
The dialectical idea is that
some change gets made,

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:16.649
some innovation gets made.
 

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:19.709
This, though,
breeds a kind of undertow,

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.560
a resistance against the
change, the first change,

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.379
and then you get as a result of
the initial change,

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.589
the undertow,
the kind of pushback,

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:36.396
but which isn't the same as a
pushback to where you started

00:04:36.396 --> 00:04:38.879
from,
you get a new starting point.

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.555
So Hegel's famous terms were
thesis,

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:44.230
antithesis,
and synthesis.

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.889
The thesis is a change.
 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.209
So you get, say,
the transition from serfdom to

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:55.100
a market-based society.
 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.819
Then you get resistance to that
market-based society.

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.470
You get a new working class
comes into being,

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.149
let's say, and then that
working class becomes the agent

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:10.827
of a new change that will
produce its own antithesis and

00:05:10.827 --> 00:05:12.360
new synthesis.
 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.259
So history goes like this,
if you like.

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:17.901
It doesn't go in a straight
line, but it goes in a

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:18.550
direction.
 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.269
It goes forward in some sense.
 

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:26.043
And Hegel's idea had been that
history eventually reaches an

00:05:26.043 --> 00:05:29.603
ending point,
and he thought the ending point

00:05:29.603 --> 00:05:32.680
was the Prussian state of his
day.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.930
He thought all of history was
evolving toward this supreme

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.660
highest point of the Prussian
state of his day,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.560
and it was guided by the
working out of ideas in history.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.778
Marx turns this on his head;
on its head I should say,

00:05:48.778 --> 00:05:49.920
not on his head.
 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.240
Marx turns it on its head
saying, "Well,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.670
yes history goes in this kind
of zigzag direction of thesis,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.160
antithesis, synthesis,
and then the synthesis becomes

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:07.113
the new thesis and so on,
and yes, it has an endpoint

00:06:07.113 --> 00:06:10.339
(which he thinks is a communist
utopia),

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.540
but it's not driven by ideas.
 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.110
It's not driven by ideas at all.
 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.660
Instead it's driven by material
interest."

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.040
So that's why Marx's view is
sometimes called,

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.819
as I said, dialectical
materialism.

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:32.307
It's driven by material
interest, or as Bill Clinton did

00:06:32.307 --> 00:06:38.324
put it in the 1992 campaign,
"It's the economy,

00:06:38.324 --> 00:06:40.329
stupid."
 

00:06:40.329 --> 00:06:42.560
"It's the economy,
stupid."

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:48.026
That's the basic idea behind
materialism that ideas,

00:06:48.026 --> 00:06:53.065
culture, beliefs,
all of that stuff is what Marx

00:06:53.065 --> 00:06:56.709
referred to as superstructure.
 

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:59.279
It's not really important.
 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.642
What is important is the
economic base,

00:07:02.642 --> 00:07:07.600
so that economic interests
drive everything over time.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.129
And if you want to understand
how a political system works you

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:15.100
better understand the economic
system.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.413
So in this sense it's a very
different view than Bentham,

00:07:18.413 --> 00:07:21.966
or Mill, or any of these folks
because they're really working

00:07:21.966 --> 00:07:23.920
in the realm of ideas,
right?

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.447
They're not Hegelians to be
sure, but they think that this

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:33.295
idea of shaping society in terms
of their utilitarian calculus

00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:36.949
can be used in order to
reorganize things.

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:41.709
For Marx that would be a
completely absurd agenda.

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:43.740
You have to start with the
economy.

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:45.329
It's the economy, stupid.
 

00:07:45.329 --> 00:07:49.769
You have to understand what the
power of forces are in the

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:54.521
economy and what the tensions
and possibilities are within the

00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:58.571
economy before you can
understand anything else about

00:07:58.571 --> 00:07:59.740
politics.
 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.903
And in that respect I think one
thing you should really get

00:08:04.903 --> 00:08:10.689
straight right away is just what
Marx thought about capitalism.

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:14.300
How many people here thought
Marx was against capitalism?

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.990
Marx was against capitalism?
 

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:18.660
Almost nobody?
 

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:22.300
Max wasn't against capitalism?
 

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:25.420
How many think he wasn't
against capitalism?

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.389
One?
 

00:08:26.389 --> 00:08:29.029
Why do you think he wasn't
against capitalism?

00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:34.360
Just get to a mic.
 

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.970
Student:  He wasn't
against capitalism because Marx

00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:41.263
thought capitalism was a
necessary step in getting to

00:08:41.263 --> 00:08:42.149
socialism.
 

00:08:42.149 --> 00:08:44.288
Prof: You're exactly
right.

00:08:44.288 --> 00:08:47.759
So what Marx thought about
capitalism was,

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:51.008
and we're going to understand
the reasons for this in detail

00:08:51.008 --> 00:08:54.886
in the next couple of lectures,
that for a certain phase of

00:08:54.886 --> 00:08:56.820
history it was essential.
 

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.620
He thought capitalism was the
most innovative,

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.091
dynamic, productive mode of
production that had ever been

00:09:05.091 --> 00:09:08.629
dreamed up,
and there was no way you could

00:09:08.629 --> 00:09:13.466
even think abut a socialist or a
communist society developing

00:09:13.466 --> 00:09:16.288
unless you had capitalism first.
 

00:09:16.288 --> 00:09:20.486
And Marx would have had
absolutely no sympathy for the

00:09:20.486 --> 00:09:24.764
Russian Revolution which was
done in a peasant society,

00:09:24.764 --> 00:09:28.168
or the Chinese communist system
either.

00:09:28.168 --> 00:09:32.224
He would have said they were
completely premature because in

00:09:32.224 --> 00:09:36.072
the end it's going to be
capitalism which is necessary to

00:09:36.072 --> 00:09:39.918
generate the wherewithal to make
socialism possible.

00:09:39.918 --> 00:09:43.708
So he wouldn't have had any
sympathy with the Leninist or

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:47.159
Stalinist projects,
which we'll talk about later.

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:49.389
So he's not against capitalism.
 

00:09:49.389 --> 00:09:53.592
What he thinks about capitalism
is that it's sawing off the

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.129
branch it's sitting on over
time.

00:09:56.129 --> 00:10:00.625
That is to say there are basic
contradictions within the way

00:10:00.625 --> 00:10:04.580
capitalism works,
and indeed the very things that

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.736
make capitalism the most
productive mode of production

00:10:08.736 --> 00:10:13.048
ever to have existed in human
history at one point,

00:10:13.048 --> 00:10:18.820
those very same dynamics
ultimately will undermine it.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:24.034
So in that sense don't think of
him as simply against

00:10:24.034 --> 00:10:25.340
capitalism.
 

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.571
He, rather, wants to understand
the dynamics process that brings

00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:32.976
capitalism into being,
leads it to maturity,

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:36.428
and eventually leads it to
self-destruct.

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:39.009
And that is the story that he's
going to tell us.

00:10:39.009 --> 00:10:40.889
So he has a scientific theory.
 

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:45.994
It's a materialist theory,
and it's based on this metaphor

00:10:45.994 --> 00:10:48.950
of the base and superstructure.
 

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:54.163
People have come up with other
metaphors, skeleton and flesh

00:10:54.163 --> 00:10:57.700
and so on, but you can play with
them.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:02.105
But the core idea is that it's
the material relations that

00:11:02.105 --> 00:11:03.960
shape everything else.
 

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:09.450
More controversially,
though, people might say,

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.787
is to say, "Well,
Marx is really a believer in

00:11:12.787 --> 00:11:15.389
individual rights and
freedoms."

00:11:15.389 --> 00:11:18.350
Most people say, "What?
 

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:22.116
Marx, a believer in individual
rights and Marx thinking that

00:11:22.116 --> 00:11:23.970
freedom is important?"
 

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.193
Most people say,
"No, Marx is an

00:11:26.193 --> 00:11:27.058
egalitarian.
 

00:11:27.058 --> 00:11:30.298
Marx is all about
equality."

00:11:30.298 --> 00:11:34.792
And one of the things I'm going
to suggest to you in my

00:11:34.792 --> 00:11:39.700
exposition of Marx is that that
is basically wrongheaded.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:44.100
You'll see that when we come to
talk about his idea of a

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:48.740
communist utopia one of his
bumper stickers for that is the

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.115
claim that,
"The free development of

00:11:52.115 --> 00:11:56.379
each is a condition for the free
development of all."

00:11:56.379 --> 00:11:59.929
"The free development of
each is the condition for the

00:11:59.929 --> 00:12:01.889
free development of all."
 

00:12:01.889 --> 00:12:04.678
So he's an egalitarian in the
sense that,

00:12:04.678 --> 00:12:07.460
yes, he wants everybody to have
freedom,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:11.635
and he thinks that that is
denied to many people in most

00:12:11.635 --> 00:12:13.990
forms of social organization.
 

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:17.250
But freedom is the most
important value,

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.678
nonetheless,
and he wants to assure it for

00:12:20.678 --> 00:12:21.850
everybody.
 

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:26.301
And related to that,
you'll see when we come to talk

00:12:26.301 --> 00:12:30.839
about on Wednesday or next
Monday the labor theory of

00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:34.450
value,
that the basic thing that

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:40.808
drives Marx is a theory of
alienation from our true selves.

00:12:40.808 --> 00:12:45.928
We can't be free unless we're
at one with our true selves.

00:12:45.928 --> 00:12:50.481
And every system of social
organization before communism,

00:12:50.481 --> 00:12:53.813
in his view,
makes it impossible for us to

00:12:53.813 --> 00:12:56.658
be at one with our true selves.
 

00:12:56.658 --> 00:13:01.698
We are alienated from our true
natures as productive creatures

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:06.738
by the way in which society is
organized, and that's the basic

00:13:06.738 --> 00:13:07.730
problem.
 

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:11.407
So we're denied our capacity
for free action,

00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:15.083
according to Marx,
and he thinks we can never

00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:19.428
realize it until we reach this
communist utopia.

00:13:19.428 --> 00:13:24.697
So the takeaway point is going
to be that Marx is an

00:13:24.697 --> 00:13:28.830
Enlightenment theorist par
excellence.

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.913
Passe people like Duncan it's
simply not correct to see him as

00:13:33.913 --> 00:13:38.245
doing something fundamentally
different than the real

00:13:38.245 --> 00:13:42.580
Enlightenment thinkers such as
Mill and Bentham.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.852
Marx is an Enlightenment
thinker, and when you want to

00:13:46.852 --> 00:13:51.610
see radical critiques of the
Enlightenment you have to go to

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.285
people like Burke and other
anti-Enlightenment thinkers who

00:13:56.285 --> 00:14:00.639
we're going to be getting to
after spring break.

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:04.659
A second point related to Marx
and individual rights and

00:14:04.659 --> 00:14:09.120
freedoms is you're going to see
that we're going to go back to

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.565
our discussion of Locke,
and you're going to discover

00:14:13.565 --> 00:14:18.048
that Marx is a true Lockean
believer in the workmanship

00:14:18.048 --> 00:14:21.160
ideal,
not in his theory of science,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.778
but in his theory of rights and
entitlements.

00:14:24.778 --> 00:14:30.047
Marx is going to embrace a kind
of doctrine of self-ownership

00:14:30.047 --> 00:14:35.666
and the idea that we own what we
make as the basis for his theory

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:39.078
of exploitation,
because his theory of

00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:43.639
exploitation is going to turn on
the claim that people are,

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:47.951
in fact, denied the fruits of
their own labor because of the

00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:50.288
way that the system is set up.
 

00:14:50.288 --> 00:14:54.470
Well, you could say,
"So what?

00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.432
Why should we care that people
are denied the fruits of their

00:14:58.432 --> 00:15:02.065
own labor unless they're
entitled to the fruits of their

00:15:02.065 --> 00:15:05.500
own labor,"
and indeed that is Marx's view.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:10.934
So you will see that--I was
once accused of belittling Marx

00:15:10.934 --> 00:15:14.590
by calling him a minor
post-Lockean,

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:19.041
but with respect to the labor
theory of value you will see

00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:23.881
that the main conceptual ideas
that go into it are straight out

00:15:23.881 --> 00:15:27.785
of Locke's Second
Treatise and it's straight

00:15:27.785 --> 00:15:30.519
out of the workmanship ideal.
 

00:15:30.519 --> 00:15:34.263
What Marx is going to try and
do, when we get to the labor

00:15:34.263 --> 00:15:37.152
theory of value,
is give a secular version of

00:15:37.152 --> 00:15:38.860
the workmanship ideal.
 

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.988
And indeed, developing a viable
secular version of the

00:15:42.988 --> 00:15:47.740
workmanship ideal is a project
with at least as long a history

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:50.700
as the history of
utilitarianism,

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:55.029
and at least as fraught with
difficulties as the history of

00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:56.298
utilitarianism.
 

00:15:56.298 --> 00:15:58.779
And we will see when we get to
Rawls,

00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:02.818
an even more radical attempt
than Marx to develop secular

00:16:02.818 --> 00:16:07.580
version of the labor theory of
value and the workmanship model,

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:10.620
and the difficulties it runs
into.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:14.697
So Marx, we will see,
is the first in a long line of

00:16:14.697 --> 00:16:19.014
people who tried to secularize
the workmanship ideal by

00:16:19.014 --> 00:16:23.572
creating this labor theory of
value that's going to have a

00:16:23.572 --> 00:16:28.210
rather checkered future as we
explore it into the twentieth

00:16:28.210 --> 00:16:29.490
century.
 

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:31.019
So that's where we're heading.
 

00:16:31.019 --> 00:16:35.518
We're going to explore Marx as
an Enlightenment thinker by

00:16:35.518 --> 00:16:40.769
means of three lectures,
and the first one is going to

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:47.759
deal with Marx and the challenge
of classical political economy.

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:49.279
Now, why do I say that?
 

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:53.048
Because really there are two
Marxes.

00:16:53.048 --> 00:16:57.546
If you were taking a course in
the history of ideas that had

00:16:57.546 --> 00:17:00.288
more than three lectures on
Marx,

00:17:00.288 --> 00:17:06.282
what you would discover is a
lot of attention to his German

00:17:06.282 --> 00:17:07.108
roots.
 

00:17:07.108 --> 00:17:10.337
I've already mentioned that he
was a disciple and critic of

00:17:10.337 --> 00:17:12.513
Hegel,
the German idealist

00:17:12.513 --> 00:17:17.801
philosopher, but much of his
writing until the mid-nineteenth

00:17:17.801 --> 00:17:22.384
century was inspired by his
critique of Hegel's other

00:17:22.384 --> 00:17:26.276
followers and disciples,
and we're pretty much not going

00:17:26.276 --> 00:17:27.038
to deal with that.
 

00:17:27.038 --> 00:17:29.740
We're not going to deal with
the German Marx.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.711
We're not, by in large,
going to deal with the young

00:17:32.711 --> 00:17:33.118
Marx.
 

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:37.823
Rather, what happened to him
was Marx thought--you may or may

00:17:37.823 --> 00:17:41.038
not know this,
but in the 1830s there were

00:17:41.038 --> 00:17:43.390
revolutions across Europe.
 

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:48.442
Kings and queens were kicked
out of office and democracy came

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:49.368
to power.
 

00:17:49.368 --> 00:17:52.730
And Marx and many of those
around him thought this is the

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.950
beginning of the end of
capitalism.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.590
By 1832 or 1833,
all of those democratic

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:03.259
revolutions had failed,
and the monarchies had been

00:18:03.259 --> 00:18:05.778
restored across Europe.
 

00:18:05.778 --> 00:18:11.333
But then in 1848 there was
another whole series of

00:18:11.333 --> 00:18:16.509
revolutions across Europe,
and once again Marx thought

00:18:16.509 --> 00:18:19.380
maybe this is the beginning of
the end,

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.626
and had great faith and
optimism that that was going to

00:18:22.626 --> 00:18:23.470
be the case.
 

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.642
But by 1851 those revolutions
had all, again,

00:18:27.642 --> 00:18:31.910
failed and the monarchs were
back in power.

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.539
And Marx, after that,
became steadily more dejected

00:18:36.539 --> 00:18:42.190
and steadily more skeptical over
his remaining years that,

00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:45.751
in fact, he was going to see a
communist revolution in his

00:18:45.751 --> 00:18:46.440
lifetime.
 

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:51.878
And rather, he invested in the
project of trying to understand

00:18:51.878 --> 00:18:56.873
capitalism in a much more
systematic way than he had done

00:18:56.873 --> 00:18:58.390
in his youth.
 

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.900
He was kicked out of Germany.
 

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:04.690
He couldn't go to France and he
wound up in London,

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.556
and he lived the last decades
of his life in London,

00:19:08.556 --> 00:19:11.740
and in fact died and was buried
there.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:16.837
If you're ever in London you
can go up to Highgate Cemetery

00:19:16.837 --> 00:19:18.858
on the Northern Line.
 

00:19:18.858 --> 00:19:20.380
It's a very interesting
cemetery.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:21.819
There are all kinds of
interesting people there.

00:19:21.819 --> 00:19:23.538
George Eliot is there.
 

00:19:23.538 --> 00:19:27.750
Anyway, there is Karl Marx in
Highgate Cemetery.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.608
It's all overgrown and very
interesting.

00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:34.384
Anyway, he spent his last
decades working in the basement

00:19:34.384 --> 00:19:38.108
of the British Museum,
and that's where he composed

00:19:38.108 --> 00:19:41.509
his magnum opus,
his three-volume work Das

00:19:41.509 --> 00:19:42.480
Kapital.
 

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.471
It was actually envisaged as a
twelve-volume work,

00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:51.114
and the only volume that was
published in his lifetime was

00:19:51.114 --> 00:19:53.068
actually volume one.
 

00:19:53.068 --> 00:19:57.411
The second and third volumes
were put together by his friend

00:19:57.411 --> 00:20:00.058
and collaborator Friedrich
Engels.

00:20:00.058 --> 00:20:05.721
And unfortunately for us the
volumes about politics were

00:20:05.721 --> 00:20:07.368
never written.
 

00:20:07.368 --> 00:20:10.125
So you have to,
to some extent,

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:15.451
put together his mature views
about politics from scraps he

00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:20.743
wrote here and there,
and some of the short pieces

00:20:20.743 --> 00:20:26.140
about politics that do appear in
the early volumes.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:32.578
So we're going to mostly focus
on the mature Marx.

00:20:32.578 --> 00:20:37.279
We're mostly going to focus on
Marx as he set himself the task

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:42.057
of understanding the dynamics of
capitalism after he had pretty

00:20:42.057 --> 00:20:46.142
much given up on his youthful
enthusiasm for the quick

00:20:46.142 --> 00:20:50.765
transformation of the world into
socialist and then communist

00:20:50.765 --> 00:20:55.227
societies,
which he had basically started

00:20:55.227 --> 00:21:01.021
to shed after 1848 with a brief
revival of interest in 1870

00:21:01.021 --> 00:21:05.971
given events in France,
but basically it was a

00:21:05.971 --> 00:21:11.910
trajectory from youthful
optimism into mature pessimism,

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:16.828
at least from his point of view.
 

00:21:16.828 --> 00:21:21.088
Okay, so what he did was,
he said to himself,

00:21:21.088 --> 00:21:24.670
"Well, what is it that
people are involved in--

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:28.587
who are engaged in the serious
systematic analysis of

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:30.019
capitalism?"
 

00:21:30.019 --> 00:21:35.772
And here we tend to present
Marx as an unorthodox or radical

00:21:35.772 --> 00:21:41.429
thinker, but in fact he was a
very conventional thinker for

00:21:41.429 --> 00:21:42.598
his day.
 

00:21:42.598 --> 00:21:48.097
That is to say Marx was a
follower of Adam Smith and David

00:21:48.097 --> 00:21:52.809
Ricardo,
and he saw himself largely as

00:21:52.809 --> 00:21:59.858
tackling and refining the
theories that they developed.

00:21:59.858 --> 00:22:04.255
And what I want to do with the
rest of our time this morning is

00:22:04.255 --> 00:22:08.579
say something about the project
of classical political economy

00:22:08.579 --> 00:22:11.700
that Marx inherited and
contributed to,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.913
and why he thought getting the
basic problems that the

00:22:15.913 --> 00:22:20.446
classical political economists
were trying to solve solved

00:22:20.446 --> 00:22:25.058
would enable us to understand
what the real conditions were

00:22:25.058 --> 00:22:30.068
that would eventually lead to
the collapse of capitalism.

00:22:30.068 --> 00:22:36.108
The most important feature of
capitalism,

00:22:36.108 --> 00:22:40.432
as far as Adam Smith was
concerned in The Wealth of

00:22:40.432 --> 00:22:43.940
Nations and his followers
after him,

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:49.440
was the division of labor.
 

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:56.469
The division of labor is really
important because it has two

00:22:56.469 --> 00:22:57.779
features.
 

00:22:57.779 --> 00:23:02.633
One, as far as Marx will be
concerned, it begins the process

00:23:02.633 --> 00:23:05.430
of alienating us from ourselves.
 

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.210
Why does it do that?
 

00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:12.190
It does that because,
instead of producing things

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:18.000
that we then consume,
we start producing things in a

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.647
situation where we divide up
tasks and that makes it

00:23:23.647 --> 00:23:28.410
impossible for us to live
rounded lives.

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.269
That's ultimately where it's
going to go.

00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:34.144
But second, and much more
important from the point of view

00:23:34.144 --> 00:23:36.999
of economics,
is that the division of labor

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:39.308
is the engine of productivity.
 

00:23:39.308 --> 00:23:43.643
The more you engage in the
division of labor the more

00:23:43.643 --> 00:23:46.058
productive you make people.
 

00:23:46.058 --> 00:23:50.319
And Smith has this wonderful
example right near the beginning

00:23:50.319 --> 00:23:54.366
of The Wealth of Nations
where he talks about a pin

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:55.220
factory.
 

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.991
Smith has been going around
England trying to understand

00:23:58.991 --> 00:24:02.010
where the dynamism in the
English economy is,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:05.509
and he gives this description
of a pin factory.

00:24:05.509 --> 00:24:07.990
He says,
One man draws out the wire,

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.387
another straights it,
a third cuts it,

00:24:10.387 --> 00:24:13.434
a fourth points it,
a fifth grinds it at the top

00:24:13.434 --> 00:24:15.250
for receiving the head.
 

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.890
To make the head requires two
or three distinct operations.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:23.819
To put it on is a peculiar
business.

00:24:23.819 --> 00:24:25.868
To whiten the pins is another.
 

00:24:25.868 --> 00:24:29.568
It is even a trade by itself to
put them into the paper.

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:32.630
And the important business of
making a pin is,

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:35.487
in this manner,
divided into about eighteen

00:24:35.487 --> 00:24:37.118
distinct operations.
 

00:24:37.118 --> 00:24:39.990
As a result of that division of
labor,

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:45.780
though, Smith calculated that
ten workers could make 48,000

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.912
pins a day,
but if they had all worked

00:24:48.912 --> 00:24:53.042
separately and independently all
they could have produced was a

00:24:53.042 --> 00:24:53.910
few dozen.
 

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:57.885
So that basic insight of
Smith's, that it's the division

00:24:57.885 --> 00:25:02.078
of labor that is the engine of
capitalist productivity,

00:25:02.078 --> 00:25:06.528
sets the terms for Adam Smith's
analysis of markets in The

00:25:06.528 --> 00:25:10.313
Wealth of Nations,
for Ricardo's

00:25:10.313 --> 00:25:15.369
refinement, and for Marx's
refinement of both of their

00:25:15.369 --> 00:25:18.710
arguments in Das Kapital.
 

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:27.058
So what was the project of
classical political economy?

00:25:27.058 --> 00:25:31.594
What was it that Marx was
stepping into and trying to

00:25:31.594 --> 00:25:32.990
contribute to?
 

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:39.048
Well, one way of describing it,
as I have it here,

00:25:39.048 --> 00:25:44.240
is, it was the search for
theories of natural and market--

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.750
I've got theories there twice,
sorry--

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:50.220
search for theories of natural
and market wages,

00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.788
prices, rents, and profits.
 

00:25:52.788 --> 00:25:56.088
They wanted to understand what
determines wages,

00:25:56.088 --> 00:25:57.944
prices, rents,
and profits,

00:25:57.944 --> 00:26:02.368
but they thought you had to
have a theory of natural wages,

00:26:02.368 --> 00:26:04.318
prices, rents,
and profits,

00:26:04.318 --> 00:26:10.460
and market wages,
prices, rents, and profits.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.589
Now, let's focus on prices,
because the way the other three

00:26:15.589 --> 00:26:20.278
are treated is basically by
analogy to the analysis of

00:26:20.278 --> 00:26:21.338
pricing.
 

00:26:21.338 --> 00:26:26.369
A modern neoclassical economist
would say, "There is no

00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:29.269
natural price of anything."
 

00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:36.251
A modern neoclassical economist
would say, "What determines

00:26:36.251 --> 00:26:41.130
prices is supply and demand in
the market.

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:45.900
There is nothing else to say
about prices."

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.980
And they gave up the notion
that there's any natural theory

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.450
of wages, prices,
rents, and profits to be found.

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:58.694
So a big difference between the
classical theorists,

00:26:58.694 --> 00:27:02.003
and the modern theorists,
is this idea that there's a

00:27:02.003 --> 00:27:03.848
theory of natural prices.
 

00:27:03.848 --> 00:27:08.136
Now, why would they think
there's a theory of natural

00:27:08.136 --> 00:27:08.880
prices?
 

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.134
The reason they thought there
was a theory of natural prices

00:27:13.134 --> 00:27:17.247
was they were arguing with
people like the physiocrats and

00:27:17.247 --> 00:27:21.069
the trade theorists about where
value comes from.

00:27:21.069 --> 00:27:23.298
What is the source of value?
 

00:27:23.298 --> 00:27:28.955
The physiocrats in France said
the source of value is the land,

00:27:28.955 --> 00:27:33.608
that somehow it gets
transferred to the products.

00:27:33.608 --> 00:27:37.460
Whereas the trade theorists,
who had been impressed that

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:41.940
countries like Holland which had
so little land but had become so

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.659
rich said,
"No.

00:27:43.659 --> 00:27:45.890
Value comes from trade."
 

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:50.160
So they were all sort of
saying, "Where is the it?

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.420
What is the source of
value?"

00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:57.323
And the English theorists
following Locke,

00:27:57.323 --> 00:28:01.510
Petty--Sir William Petty,
John Locke, Hobbes,

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:07.700
all believed that the way you
find value is to go into labor;

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.598
that work, workmanship is the
source of value.

00:28:12.598 --> 00:28:15.400
So all classical political
economists,

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.636
Smith, Ricardo and Marx
believed in the labor theory of

00:28:20.636 --> 00:28:23.236
value,
and they counter posed it to

00:28:23.236 --> 00:28:26.940
theories based on trade,
or the physiocrats' theories

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:32.500
that were popular in France,
as I've said.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.373
So that's one reason,
but another is that it's not

00:28:36.373 --> 00:28:40.880
the case that they were ignorant
of the laws of supply and

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.750
demand.
 

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:47.960
So and we'll see how Marx
handles them on Wednesday.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.256
It's not the case that they're
ignorant of the laws of supply

00:28:52.256 --> 00:28:56.624
and demand, but they thought it
couldn't possibly tell you the

00:28:56.624 --> 00:28:57.769
whole story.
 

00:28:57.769 --> 00:28:59.750
So you can think about it this
way.

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:07.920
Suppose there is a dearth in
the supply of coffee mugs?

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.769
The price will go up.
 

00:29:10.769 --> 00:29:14.578
They didn't disagree with that,
right?

00:29:14.578 --> 00:29:17.906
And if there are too many
coffee mugs, more coffee mugs

00:29:17.906 --> 00:29:20.680
than anybody wants,
the price will go down.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:25.038
Maybe somebody will realize you
an drill holes in the bottom and

00:29:25.038 --> 00:29:29.417
then use them to grow plants in,
and then maybe the price would

00:29:29.417 --> 00:29:32.028
go up a bit because there will
be more.

00:29:32.028 --> 00:29:35.938
But they thought that supply
and demand fluctuate with what

00:29:35.938 --> 00:29:38.230
it is that people actually want.
 

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:41.068
They didn't have any problem
with that notion,

00:29:41.068 --> 00:29:45.260
but still in all they thought
there must be something that

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:49.673
will tell you what the price is
when supply and demand are in

00:29:49.673 --> 00:29:50.848
equilibrium.
 

00:29:50.848 --> 00:29:54.958
Another way you can think about
it is supply and demand go up

00:29:54.958 --> 00:29:57.880
and down,
but they go up and down around

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:03.019
some point,
and what tells you what that

00:30:03.019 --> 00:30:04.528
point is?
 

00:30:04.528 --> 00:30:08.083
Okay, that's what the labor
theory of value was supposed to

00:30:08.083 --> 00:30:08.390
do.
 

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.548
That's the natural price.
 

00:30:10.548 --> 00:30:15.301
I think a modern economist
might call it the long-run

00:30:15.301 --> 00:30:17.130
equilibrium price.
 

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:21.470
That's one way in which if you
wanted to find an analogy in

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.885
modern economic thinking to this
classical idea of a natural

00:30:25.885 --> 00:30:28.643
price,
it's the long-run equilibrium

00:30:28.643 --> 00:30:29.108
price.
 

00:30:29.108 --> 00:30:33.982
It's the price of a commodity
when supply and demand are in

00:30:33.982 --> 00:30:35.160
equilibrium.
 

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:43.400
So the labor theory of value
was a theory of that.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.984
It was going to tell you what
the long-run equilibrium price

00:30:46.984 --> 00:30:48.930
of a commodity would be,
okay?

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.808
And all of the classical
political economists were trying

00:30:52.808 --> 00:30:54.680
to have a theory of that.
 

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.457
So when you read "natural
prices,"

00:30:57.457 --> 00:30:59.460
that's what you should think.
 

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.690
They're trying to understand
what--

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:06.980
not marginal changes in the
sense of a Pareto diagram,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:12.402
but the long-run changes given
the marginal fluctuations around

00:31:12.402 --> 00:31:13.538
some point.
 

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:15.640
The question is,
what is that point?

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.986
And that's what the labor
theory of value was designed to

00:31:19.986 --> 00:31:20.838
give you.
 

00:31:20.838 --> 00:31:22.865
It was a theory,
in that sense,

00:31:22.865 --> 00:31:26.308
of natural prices,
not a theory of market prices.

00:31:26.308 --> 00:31:28.098
They thought you had to have
both.

00:31:28.098 --> 00:31:30.348
Supply and demand gave you the
market price.

00:31:30.348 --> 00:31:35.410
The labor theory of value gave
you the natural price.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:40.756
A second big problem that
framed the project of classical

00:31:40.756 --> 00:31:45.338
political economy was that they
all believed,

00:31:45.338 --> 00:31:50.048
as they looked around them,
that there was a declining

00:31:50.048 --> 00:31:52.980
tendency in the rate of profit.
 

00:31:52.980 --> 00:32:02.228
This was taken as a given;
as a given, widely-accepted

00:32:02.228 --> 00:32:04.390
empirical fact.
 

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:10.601
And so if it was the case that
the rate of profit tends to

00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:14.380
decline over time,
it can be offset by various

00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.808
things and so on which we will
talk about,

00:32:16.808 --> 00:32:20.659
but if it's the case that the
rate of profit in capitalist

00:32:20.659 --> 00:32:25.205
economies declines over time,
your theory isn't going to be

00:32:25.205 --> 00:32:28.578
worth a damn unless you can
explain why.

00:32:28.578 --> 00:32:31.152
So one of the tests,
if you like,

00:32:31.152 --> 00:32:35.085
of a good theory,
as far as Smith was concerned,

00:32:35.085 --> 00:32:37.720
as far as Ricardo was
concerned,

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:41.964
and as far as Marx was
concerned, was it had to explain

00:32:41.964 --> 00:32:45.660
the declining tendency in the
rate of profit.

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:49.344
And Smith had an account,
Ricardo had an account,

00:32:49.344 --> 00:32:51.339
and Marx had an account.
 

00:32:51.339 --> 00:32:52.380
They all differed somewhat.
 

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.118
They all overlapped in some
ways.

00:32:55.118 --> 00:32:59.291
We'll see part of the reason
all three of them thought you

00:32:59.291 --> 00:33:03.609
would have to have imperialism
was you needed new markets to

00:33:03.609 --> 00:33:07.710
offset this problem of the
declining tendency in the rate

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:12.045
of profit at home,
but that was only going to be a

00:33:12.045 --> 00:33:14.548
temporary stopgap or solution.
 

00:33:14.548 --> 00:33:18.162
But in any event,
your theory wasn't going to be

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:22.928
worth anything unless it could
explain why prices are what they

00:33:22.928 --> 00:33:25.000
are,
the theory of long-run

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.907
equilibrium prices,
and second, unless it gave a

00:33:30.907 --> 00:33:41.067
credible account of why profits
fall in capitalist systems over

00:33:41.067 --> 00:33:42.380
time.
 

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:47.567
Now, a third conceptual point
to make that you need in order

00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:52.669
to understand the project of
classical political economy as

00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:58.210
Marx understood it is actually
related to the first point,

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:01.997
but I'm just singling it out
because people sometimes get

00:34:01.997 --> 00:34:03.348
confused about it.
 

00:34:03.348 --> 00:34:07.940
It's a distinction that Marx
makes between use-value and

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:09.360
exchange value.
 

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:15.800
Sometimes you'll see Marx uses
the word value with a big V.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:19.300
You should just read that as
exchange value.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:27.809
So value with a big V is
exchange value.

00:34:27.809 --> 00:34:31.344
So what is the difference
between use-value and exchange

00:34:31.344 --> 00:34:31.860
value?
 

00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:36.619
Well, for Marx use-value is
utility.

00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:40.780
That's all it is.
 

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:45.340
Use-value is simply usefulness.
 

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:49.789
And he has a kind of binary
theory of use-value.

00:34:49.789 --> 00:34:52.809
Either things have use value or
they don't.

00:34:52.809 --> 00:34:55.726
So coffee cups have a
use-value, you can drink out of

00:34:55.726 --> 00:34:56.119
them.
 

00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:59.166
If somebody drilled holes in
the bottom of them they would

00:34:59.166 --> 00:35:02.159
have no use-value until somebody
came along and said,

00:35:02.159 --> 00:35:04.476
"Well, we can use them to
grow plants,"

00:35:04.476 --> 00:35:06.070
then they would have use-value.
 

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:09.114
So things either have use-value
or they don't,

00:35:09.114 --> 00:35:11.889
and I'll come back to that in a
minute.

00:35:11.889 --> 00:35:15.867
And that's going to affect the
supply and demand,

00:35:15.867 --> 00:35:19.349
but it's not going to explain
the price.

00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:24.110
It's not going to explain the
long-run equilibrium price.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:28.766
That is the exchange value and
that is what we learn about from

00:35:28.766 --> 00:35:33.050
the labor theory of value as far
as Marx was concerned.

00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:38.068
So it's the labor theory of
value explains the price,

00:35:38.068 --> 00:35:43.858
and is not to be confused with
the use-value or utility of an

00:35:43.858 --> 00:35:44.920
object.
 

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:48.501
Again, one important
difference, and maybe the most

00:35:48.501 --> 00:35:52.726
important difference between
classical political economy and

00:35:52.726 --> 00:35:55.518
neoclassical political economy
is,

00:35:55.518 --> 00:35:58.851
we will see later,
the neoclassical people shed

00:35:58.851 --> 00:36:03.052
the labor theory of value and so
there is no exchange value

00:36:03.052 --> 00:36:06.559
independent of utility,
but we'll get to that.

00:36:06.559 --> 00:36:08.380
That's getting ahead of
ourselves.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:13.110
When you're concerned with the
classical formulations,

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:17.320
and in the nineteenth century,
exchange value or price,

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:22.512
or value with a big V,
is determined by the labor

00:36:22.512 --> 00:36:27.489
theory of value and use-value is
usefulness.

00:36:27.489 --> 00:36:35.070
And that brings me to Marx's
definition of a commodity.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:39.860
 
 

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:45.300
A commodity has a very special
meaning for Marx.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:51.518
It's something that is produced
for exchange.

00:36:51.518 --> 00:36:58.387
So if you plant an apple tree
and you grow apples in order to

00:36:58.387 --> 00:37:05.139
eat them, you're producing for
consumption, those apples are

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:07.429
not commodities.
 

00:37:07.429 --> 00:37:12.170
But if you plant an apple tree
and grow apples and sell them,

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:15.570
then those apples are
commodities, right?

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:21.320
And something is a commodity if
it's produced for exchange.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:24.693
And that's very important
because once you have a division

00:37:24.693 --> 00:37:27.949
of labor you have more and more
commodity production.

00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:33.242
And you might recall in my very
first lecture I said that one of

00:37:33.242 --> 00:37:38.364
the things Marx shares in common
with Bentham is he's somebody

00:37:38.364 --> 00:37:43.237
who pushes the idea he has to
the absolute extreme and then

00:37:43.237 --> 00:37:45.170
even beyond that.
 

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:49.936
So what we're going to see
happen with Marx and

00:37:49.936 --> 00:37:55.115
commodification is exactly
analogous to Bentham and

00:37:55.115 --> 00:37:56.360
utility.
 

00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:59.985
That Bentham says,
"How would the world look

00:37:59.985 --> 00:38:03.989
if utility maximization was the
only game in town,

00:38:03.989 --> 00:38:07.590
if there was nothing else at
all?"

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.409
and so his theory runs.
 

00:38:09.409 --> 00:38:12.710
With Marx it's,
"How would the world look

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:16.599
if commodification was the only
game in town?"

00:38:16.599 --> 00:38:22.590
Everything in a capitalist
system becomes a commodity,

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.530
even the worker himself.
 

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.230
Even the worker himself.
 

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.661
And when we start to understand
the dynamics of capitalist

00:38:31.661 --> 00:38:35.936
production we'll see that the
analysis of the value of a

00:38:35.936 --> 00:38:40.833
worker is no different than the
analysis of the value of the pin

00:38:40.833 --> 00:38:45.110
that the worker produces in Adam
Smith's factory.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:50.952
So he takes this idea of
commodification and pushes it to

00:38:50.952 --> 00:38:52.099
the hilt.
 

00:38:52.099 --> 00:38:57.648
So I think if you think about
those four features of the

00:38:57.648 --> 00:39:03.802
project of classical political
economy it gives you a sense of

00:39:03.802 --> 00:39:09.652
what was in Marx's head as he
set off to try and understand

00:39:09.652 --> 00:39:13.789
the dynamics of capitalist
systems.

00:39:13.789 --> 00:39:18.849
And what he did was,
he said, "Well,

00:39:18.849 --> 00:39:23.219
we have to understand,
first of all,

00:39:23.219 --> 00:39:30.090
how capitalist systems look to
the participants,

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:34.994
because the way in which they
look to the participants is not

00:39:34.994 --> 00:39:39.409
the same as the way in which
they really work."

00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:41.978
So there's a basic distinction,
if you like,

00:39:41.978 --> 00:39:43.949
between appearance and reality.
 

00:39:43.949 --> 00:39:49.163
The way in which people think
market systems work isn't the

00:39:49.163 --> 00:39:52.219
way in which they actually work.
 

00:39:52.219 --> 00:39:54.119
So it's a little like Bentham
saying,

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:58.820
"You might think you're
not motivated by utility and all

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.327
the rest of it,
but in fact you are,

00:40:01.327 --> 00:40:03.469
and the rare case is we get it
right,

00:40:03.469 --> 00:40:05.860
not the rare case is that we
get it wrong."

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.958
In this sense Marx,
like Bentham,

00:40:07.958 --> 00:40:09.268
is an objectivist.
 

00:40:09.268 --> 00:40:13.146
He thinks he's describing
scientifically the laws of

00:40:13.146 --> 00:40:17.175
motion of capitalist systems
regardless of whether the

00:40:17.175 --> 00:40:22.268
participants in those systems
understand these laws of motion,

00:40:22.268 --> 00:40:26.039
and for the most part they
don't.

00:40:26.039 --> 00:40:29.795
Indeed he's going to claim
ultimately that a socialist

00:40:29.795 --> 00:40:33.692
revolution differs from all
others because for the first

00:40:33.692 --> 00:40:37.268
time in history,
people understand the social

00:40:37.268 --> 00:40:42.768
relations that they're part of,
and so can self-consciously

00:40:42.768 --> 00:40:48.960
transform them and create an
unalienated social order.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:53.465
So at the beginning of volume
one of Kapital he's

00:40:53.465 --> 00:40:57.235
basically saying,
"How does it look to the

00:40:57.235 --> 00:40:59.119
participants?"
 

00:40:59.119 --> 00:41:03.452
Well, if you have a division of
labor, you look around,

00:41:03.452 --> 00:41:05.619
what do you actually see?
 

00:41:05.619 --> 00:41:10.420
You see people producing
commodities.

00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:15.382
They exchange those commodities
for money, and then they use

00:41:15.382 --> 00:41:20.260
that money to buy other
commodities, which they consume.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:23.340
So you have these cycles of
exchange;

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.679
commodity, money,
commodity, right?

00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:32.768
So the person working growing
apples, sells the apples for

00:41:32.768 --> 00:41:38.213
money, and then uses the money
to buy milk and eggs and so on,

00:41:38.213 --> 00:41:41.070
in the simplest case,
right?

00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:45.789
So if someone landed from Mars
in the middle of a capitalist

00:41:45.789 --> 00:41:48.829
economy, that's what they would
see;

00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:52.532
all of these people producing
things, exchanging those things

00:41:52.532 --> 00:41:56.112
for money, and buying other
things which they then consume,

00:41:56.112 --> 00:41:56.730
right?
 

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.739
That was the idea.
 

00:41:59.739 --> 00:42:03.840
But then if you look a little
bit more carefully,

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.284
you see that actually some
people are doing something

00:42:08.284 --> 00:42:10.250
entirely different.
 

00:42:10.250 --> 00:42:13.402
Most people are producing
commodities, exchanging the

00:42:13.402 --> 00:42:16.918
commodities for money and then
using the money to buy other

00:42:16.918 --> 00:42:18.980
commodities that they consume.
 

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.559
But Marx says,
"Some people are doing

00:42:22.559 --> 00:42:24.480
something different.
 

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:30.007
They're taking some money,
buying a commodity (in this

00:42:30.007 --> 00:42:36.681
case the labor of the worker for
a certain time) and then selling

00:42:36.681 --> 00:42:41.268
what gets produced for more
money."

00:42:41.268 --> 00:42:45.708
So they're not interested in
consumption it doesn't seem,

00:42:45.708 --> 00:42:47.768
at least at first sight.
 

00:42:47.768 --> 00:42:54.605
And indeed, if you look even
more closely you'll see that

00:42:54.605 --> 00:43:00.342
when they do that,
the money they end up with is

00:43:00.342 --> 00:43:05.469
more than the money they started
with.

00:43:05.469 --> 00:43:10.210
M prime is bigger than M.
 

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:13.398
And the question,
the organizing question of

00:43:13.398 --> 00:43:17.211
Das Kapital--
and it was the question that

00:43:17.211 --> 00:43:21.500
preoccupied Adam Smith and David
Ricardo before Marx,

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.110
and as I said,
in this sense he was completely

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:29.579
orthodox classical theorist,
his radicalism comes in later.

00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:32.659
The question is where does
prime come from?

00:43:32.659 --> 00:43:36.860
What makes profit possible?
 

00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:39.914
You're not going to explain why
profits decline,

00:43:39.914 --> 00:43:43.295
after all, if you can't
understand where profit comes

00:43:43.295 --> 00:43:43.880
from.
 

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:53.039
What is the origin of profit?
 

00:43:53.039 --> 00:43:57.070
That's the basic problem.
 

00:43:57.070 --> 00:44:00.952
The transformation of money
into capital has to be developed

00:44:00.952 --> 00:44:04.309
on the basis of the immanent
laws of the exchange of

00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:07.797
commodities,
in such a way that the starting

00:44:07.797 --> 00:44:10.699
point is the exchange of
equivalents.

00:44:10.699 --> 00:44:14.909
The money-owner who is as yet
only the capitalist in larval

00:44:14.909 --> 00:44:17.458
form,
must buy his commodities at

00:44:17.458 --> 00:44:20.409
their value,
sell them at their value,

00:44:20.409 --> 00:44:24.809
and yet at the end of the
process withdraw more value from

00:44:24.809 --> 00:44:28.980
circulation than he threw into
it at the beginning.

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:33.663
His emergence as a butterfly
must, and yet must not,

00:44:33.663 --> 00:44:37.518
take place in the sphere of
circulation.

00:44:37.518 --> 00:44:40.889
These are the conditions of the
problem.

00:44:40.889 --> 00:44:45.829
A very famous passage at the
beginning of Kapital

00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:51.130
telling us that if you want to
understand why the capitalist

00:44:51.130 --> 00:44:57.150
winds up with more you have to
understand the source of value,

00:44:57.150 --> 00:45:02.853
because there's no cheating;
equivalents exchange for

00:45:02.853 --> 00:45:06.079
equivalents in every one of
those cycles.

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:09.521
It's not that somehow the
worker is tricked into selling

00:45:09.521 --> 00:45:12.150
his labor power for less than
its worth.

00:45:12.150 --> 00:45:15.476
On the contrary,
he's paid exactly what its

00:45:15.476 --> 00:45:16.110
worth.
 

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:21.630
So once you can understand that
puzzle of how,

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:24.539
when equivalents exchange for
equivalents,

00:45:24.539 --> 00:45:28.559
new value is still nonetheless
created,

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:32.070
then you understand the secret
to where profit comes from,

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:36.550
you know the source of value,
and you can begin the process

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:41.188
of understanding the dynamic
productiveness of capitalism and

00:45:41.188 --> 00:45:44.820
why it will eventually start to
fall apart.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:48.800
And we will dig into those
subjects on Wednesday.

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:54.000

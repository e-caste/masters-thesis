RONALD SMITH: We're starting a new subject

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.267
and I wanted to just remind

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:08.867
you what we've done, so you
see how this fits into the

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:09.900
larger picture.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.033
We spent quite a few weeks
looking at physical processes

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:19.000
in the atmosphere, like why do
winds blow, the geostrophic

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.500
law, hydrostatic law,
thermodynamics of lifting air,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.567
how clouds form, how rain forms,
how radiation causes

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:28.767
the layering in the
atmosphere.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.633
So that was an important
section.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:34.233
Now we're moving into some
other sections that are a

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:37.933
little more descriptive.

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:40.133
We'll still be doing some
quantitative work as we move

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:42.267
through the course, but for
the moment, we're kind of

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:45.867
putting some of these
pieces together

00:00:45.867 --> 00:00:47.067
to see the big picture.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:53.067
So we looked at the general
circulation of the atmosphere.

00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:56.067
And then last week we
looked at storms,

00:00:56.067 --> 00:00:57.200
various storm types.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.600
Now we're going to put those two
things together and try to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.833
look at the distribution of
climate around the globe.

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.567
And I'm going to do
this in part--

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:11.200
I'm going to start out very
briefly ignoring the seasons.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.067
But we can't get very far with
describing climate without

00:01:15.067 --> 00:01:18.700
understanding the seasons, how
the seasons work in various

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.767
places, because that's
such an important

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:24.167
part of climate also.

00:01:24.167 --> 00:01:31.967
So what's up here says that we
can describe climate pretty

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:36.167
well if we know the monthly
values of temperature and

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:38.200
precipitation.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.067
That would be 24 numbers.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:44.567
With 24 numbers, what are
the average precip

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:45.700
values for each month?

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.233
What are the average
temperature

00:01:49.233 --> 00:01:50.167
values for each month?

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:52.333
That's pretty much a full
description of climate.

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:55.600
The way you would normally do
that is to collect data for 10

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.267
or 20 or 30 years, and then
you'd average together all the

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:04.267
Januarys to get the average
January, all the Februarys to

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:05.633
get the average February.

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:09.167
And you'd plot that up as the
average seasonal cycle.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.700
And that's typically the
definition of climate.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.100
Now, storms come into that
because very often, storms are

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.000
controlling the precipitation.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.967
But you might want to include
some other aspects of

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:24.867
climatology not mentioned
here.

00:02:24.867 --> 00:02:28.933
For example, if an area is prone
to hurricanes, probably

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:31.267
a description of climate should
include that as a

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:34.900
little separate item, because
it's important for the people

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.767
that live there and the
farmers and the

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:39.800
fishermen and so on.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.067
So the definition of climate
is not quite cut and dried,

00:02:46.067 --> 00:02:49.267
but I would say that for the
most part, you need those 24

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:54.267
numbers in order to describe the
climate of any particular

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:55.333
place on the Earth.

00:02:55.333 --> 00:03:00.867
The factors that control climate
are primarily these.

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:05.133
Latitude, because of the way
that the general circulation

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:10.600
tends to give a latitudinal
structure to climate--

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.800
the Hadley cells, the belts of
storms, the belts of deserts.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.300
So as you go from latitude to
latitude, you're kind of

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.233
moving through these
different zones.

00:03:19.233 --> 00:03:24.167
So latitude's very important,
but it's not everything.

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:26.767
Mountains play a very big
role, something called

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:29.433
continentality--

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:30.933
which I'll describe
in a minute--

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:35.567
and ocean currents also play
a role in determining what

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.933
climate it is.

00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:40.467
And I'll be going through
these today.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.033
So just to remind you about
the general circulation,

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:57.933
you've got the symmetry about
the equator, with a Hadley

00:03:57.933 --> 00:04:04.400
cell rising near the equator
sending air poleward in both

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.233
hemispheres, descending near
the tropics of Cancer and

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:11.700
Capricorn, and then the trade
winds under the influence of

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.000
the Coriolis force--

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.467
these winds don't move directly

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:15.767
back towards the equator.

00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:19.933
Instead they get deflected to
the right and to the left and

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:23.033
end up being the northeast and
the southeast trade winds.

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:25.733
And then you've got the
belts of storms,

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:27.600
the belts of deserts.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.700
And so if this were the full--
if you took away the

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.733
continents--

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:38.167
if you either had a uniform
ocean-covered planet or a

00:04:38.167 --> 00:04:43.867
uniform land-covered planet,
then you could probably pretty

00:04:43.867 --> 00:04:46.600
much end with the latitudinal
control.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.867
That'd be really the
dominant factor.

00:04:48.867 --> 00:04:52.567
But in fact, you've got mountain
belts, you've got

00:04:52.567 --> 00:04:55.433
continents, you've got oceans,
you've got ocean currents, all

00:04:55.433 --> 00:05:01.233
of which give some east-west
variations in climate.

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:04.567
So it's not just latitude
control, as this diagram would

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:07.900
have you think, but it also
depends where you are because

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.767
of the mountains,
the continents,

00:05:09.767 --> 00:05:12.000
and the ocean currents.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.333
Stop me if you have any
questions here.

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:18.433
So when you look at an
annual precip map--

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:19.833
this is for land only.

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:23.433
So this is traditional data
collected from rain gauges,

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:27.000
summed up over many years,
and summed up over all

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.100
the seasons as well.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.733
So this is annual
precipitation.

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:37.400
You do see the latitudinal
control from the general

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.167
circulation.

00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:42.867
You see a belt of rainforest
near the equator, expressed in

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:50.300
South America, in Africa, and
in the continent-- in the

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.233
so-called maritime continent
off of southeast Asia.

00:05:55.233 --> 00:06:02.233
You see the belt of deserts in
both hemispheres about here,

00:06:02.233 --> 00:06:05.500
but it's best expressed
in the Sahara desert

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.967
and the Arabian peninsula.

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:09.567
Then it tends to slide northward
a little bit because

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:11.167
of the mountains here.

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:14.000
And we see it expressed a
little bit in the desert

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.700
southwest, but not so much
in Florida, for example.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.300
And then the mirror image of
that coming down here--

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:24.000
you see the belt of deserts
especially on the west coast

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.800
of South America, the west coast
of Africa, and most of

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.167
the interior of Australia.

00:06:32.167 --> 00:06:38.600
Now the high latitudes appear
as areas with very small

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:39.667
precipitation.

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:42.167
I hesitate to call them deserts,
however, because

00:06:42.167 --> 00:06:45.500
remember, because they're
cold, the evaporation

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.467
rate is very slow.

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:50.400
And so what little precipitation
you get could

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.567
cause a very moist
climate there.

00:06:54.567 --> 00:06:56.800
So precipitation is not
the only factor.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.000
Evaporation plays an equally
important role in determining

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.100
the climate of these
various regions.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.833
So as you've seen, then, you
can see this latitudinal

00:07:08.833 --> 00:07:12.533
control, but it's also
quite broken up

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:14.133
by these other factors--

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.733
the mountains, the continents,
and the ocean currents.

00:07:16.733 --> 00:07:19.333
Probably one of the best
examples of that is in South

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:25.267
America, where you've got a wet
west coast and a dry east

00:07:25.267 --> 00:07:28.867
coast in these mid-latitudes.

00:07:28.867 --> 00:07:32.033
Well, that's because this is
the belt of westerlies.

00:07:32.033 --> 00:07:33.567
The winds are coming
like this.

00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:37.067
They have to climb over
the mountains there.

00:07:37.067 --> 00:07:40.000
As the air rises, it cools
adiabatically, and you get

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.067
rain on the west coast. But then
the air descends and you

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:46.333
get dry conditions on
the east coast.

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:47.467
You go up here--

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.867
it's just reversed.

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:52.400
The dry is on the west coast,
the wet is in the interior,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.467
but this is the belt
of easterlies.

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:56.767
So you get this orographic
effect, this mountain effect,

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:58.067
kind of reversed.

00:07:58.067 --> 00:08:01.267
You find it elsewhere, but
nowhere quite as nicely

00:08:01.267 --> 00:08:06.367
expressed as in the Andes and
the southern Andes there.

00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:09.267
So that's a good example of
where mountains are screwing

00:08:09.267 --> 00:08:14.600
up that simple latitudinal
distribution of climate.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.133
When you include the oceans--

00:08:17.133 --> 00:08:20.867
and now this comes not from
traditional land-based weather

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:21.733
stations, of course.

00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:23.867
This is a satellite product.

00:08:23.867 --> 00:08:28.033
We've had satellites in orbit
that can detect precipitating

00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:32.433
clouds for a decade or more,
and so we can begin to put

00:08:32.433 --> 00:08:36.600
together a full global picture
of precipitation.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:41.267
You still see the maxima over
the continents, just where we

00:08:41.267 --> 00:08:45.333
had them in the other pictures--
the belt of

00:08:45.333 --> 00:08:49.833
rainforest is here and here.

00:08:49.833 --> 00:08:51.900
But you also see what's going
on over the oceans.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.300
And rather dramatically, you
find these east-west elongated

00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:00.533
structures, especially
in the North Pacific.

00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:03.433
And remember, the equator
is right here.

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:06.800
And that is an expression of the
inter-tropical convergence

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:10.367
zone, where the two trade
winds are converging.

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:11.833
Notice it's not at
the equator.

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:13.100
It's north of the equator.

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.267
In the Western Pacific, you
have a double structure,

00:09:17.267 --> 00:09:19.333
indicating that the
inter-tropical convergence

00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:23.167
zone spends a few months a year
here and a few months a

00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:24.733
year there.

00:09:24.733 --> 00:09:28.100
So it tends to move back and
forth a little bit in the in

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:32.533
the western tropical Pacific.

00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:37.533
Generally very dry conditions
where you see the purples, and

00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:42.400
wetter conditions where you see
the warmer colors there.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.367
Questions on this?

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:48.033
Again, this is annual average,
so the seasons don't show up

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:48.533
in this yet.

00:09:48.533 --> 00:09:50.200
I'm going to get to the seasons

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.333
in a couple of moments.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:56.733
When you take a diagram like
this and average it east to

00:09:56.733 --> 00:10:00.533
west, it's called
a zonal average.

00:10:00.533 --> 00:10:03.133
A zonally averaged precipitation
would be, at

00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:06.700
each latitude, just average
around the globe to get the

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.033
total precipitation.

00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:09.600
And that gives you a
diagram like this.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.900
Now, this is broken up by
season, or by month of the

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.967
year rather, but they're not
so terribly different.

00:10:15.967 --> 00:10:20.000
Basically, it's a three-humped
profile.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.933
Three peaks.

00:10:22.933 --> 00:10:25.200
The biggest one is somewhere
around the equator, although

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.200
you see it moves around a
little bit with month.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.833
And that's the inter-tropical
convergence zone.

00:10:31.833 --> 00:10:34.200
Winds converging at
low altitudes.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.967
The air goes up, deep clouds,
heavy precipitation.

00:10:37.967 --> 00:10:40.000
Then you get the belt
of deserts.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.533
So even though you have all
these interferences due to

00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:49.833
mountains and ocean currents
and continents and so on,

00:10:49.833 --> 00:10:55.667
still you see that three-banded
structure come

00:10:55.667 --> 00:10:59.700
through that's based on the
general circulation.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:04.767
The ITCZ, the two belts of
deserts where air is

00:11:04.767 --> 00:11:07.533
descending in the
Hadley cells.

00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:11.100
And then these are the belts of
mid-latitude storms. This

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.000
is up in the westerlies, where
you're getting all these comma

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.667
clouds and cold fronts and warm
fronts moving west to

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:20.200
east, bringing you
precipitation.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.000
So three nice peaks, a
certain symmetry--

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.467
that's what the general
circulation is doing.

00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:32.933
Questions here?

00:11:32.933 --> 00:11:34.200
OK.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.333
We can zoom in to a particular
continent, like North America

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:42.800
or our own country.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:45.567
Here is the annual average
precipitation.

00:11:45.567 --> 00:11:48.367
The values are given
here in inches.

00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:52.633
The dry values are the deep
reds and the highest

00:11:52.633 --> 00:11:55.867
precipitations are the
blues and the grays.

00:11:55.867 --> 00:11:59.367
And the highest precipitation
in our country generally

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:03.767
occurs in the west coast,
especially the Pacific

00:12:03.767 --> 00:12:09.367
Northwest, where you get a lot
of moist air masses and

00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:12.467
frontal storms moving in off
the Pacific Ocean, hitting

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:14.167
these mountains.

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:18.800
And so you get the combination
of cyclonic frontal storms

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.167
which are already precipitating,
then the air

00:12:21.167 --> 00:12:23.567
has to run up over the
mountains, and you get the

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:24.700
extra precip there.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.333
Most of that water is removed
that moves on from the Pacific

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:34.333
Ocean by the mountain ranges of
the west coast, leaving the

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:35.567
interior rather dry.

00:12:38.067 --> 00:12:41.300
That's kind of a rain
shadow effect.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.267
And a fundamental question would
be, OK, if I've rained

00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:47.833
all the water out, or for
whatever reason I'm not

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:50.700
getting the precipitation
downstream of the coastal

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.333
mountains, how far does that
effect extend eastward?

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:55.700
And you see it here.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.467
By the time you get west of--

00:12:57.467 --> 00:12:59.333
into Colorado--

00:12:59.333 --> 00:13:02.567
and then eastward of that you're
gradually starting to

00:13:02.567 --> 00:13:04.800
pick up your precipitation
again.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.300
But that's because
you now have got

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.900
some new water sources.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:10.633
You've got moist air moving up
in this region off the Gulf of

00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:13.033
Mexico, and along the east
coast, you've got some, even

00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:18.067
though you're in the belt of
westerlies, you occasionally

00:13:18.067 --> 00:13:23.000
have easterly flow that can
bring moist air in off the

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.833
Atlantic Ocean.

00:13:23.833 --> 00:13:28.200
So eventually this rain shadow
reduces in its effect when you

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:31.867
pick up some other water
vapor sources.

00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:32.567
Question?

00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:34.633
STUDENT: In about the
middle of the

00:13:34.633 --> 00:13:37.067
country, it has that line--

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:41.700
why is it so-- instead of being
longer, why is it so

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.600
abrupt a change?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.933
PROFESSOR: You're speaking
about this

00:13:44.933 --> 00:13:46.300
gradient through here?

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.867
Well, basically, remember
you're also descending.

00:13:48.867 --> 00:13:52.200
You're coming down into lower
altitudes as you come across

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.467
the Great Plains.

00:13:53.467 --> 00:13:55.500
And that, again, helps
this moisture to

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.400
get up in that region.

00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.200
But basically this is just
the ending of the--

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.867
the further you get east, the
more you have the influence of

00:14:01.867 --> 00:14:03.533
that new water vapor source.

00:14:03.533 --> 00:14:06.767
I'd say that's the primary
thing controlling that

00:14:06.767 --> 00:14:08.033
gradient region.

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:13.833
So just to zoom in on
California, then--

00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:18.100
and again, the blue colors are
high precipitation and the

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.100
reds are low.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:24.067
So there's a coastal mountain
range that has precip.

00:14:24.067 --> 00:14:26.600
Then the central valley, which
is quite dry, and then the

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.033
Sierra Nevada range which
lifts the air again.

00:14:30.033 --> 00:14:33.833
So this is a nice example of
orographic precipitation.

00:14:33.833 --> 00:14:37.567
Orographic precipitation is
defined as precipitation

00:14:37.567 --> 00:14:42.567
caused by the lifting of
air by a mountain.

00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:44.733
And the thermodynamics
of it you are already

00:14:44.733 --> 00:14:47.067
quite familiar with.

00:14:47.067 --> 00:14:47.967
You lift the air.

00:14:47.967 --> 00:14:51.333
It's moving to lower pressure
because pressure decreases as

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:53.100
you go up in the atmosphere.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.367
The air expands, cools
adiabatically--

00:14:56.367 --> 00:14:58.433
you've heard this story
over and over now.

00:14:58.433 --> 00:15:01.133
It drops the saturation
vapor pressure.

00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:05.533
The relative humidity finally
exceeds 100%.

00:15:05.533 --> 00:15:08.000
The excess water vapor condenses
and, under the right

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.667
conditions, you can get
precipitation coming out of

00:15:11.667 --> 00:15:12.533
those clouds.

00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:17.067
So orographic precipitation
is really a big control.

00:15:17.067 --> 00:15:20.467
And the rivers that provide
water to the people and the

00:15:20.467 --> 00:15:23.667
agriculture in California
basically get their water from

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:24.967
the mountains.

00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:28.633
So the water that falls in the
mountains by this process

00:15:28.633 --> 00:15:32.700
pretty much gives California
the water it needs for

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:36.200
agriculture and for
human consumption.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.067
It's a pretty dry state
except for the

00:15:39.067 --> 00:15:40.300
influence of the mountains.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.000
Oregon is a similar thing.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.567
Look at the contrast between the
eastern and western part

00:15:47.567 --> 00:15:48.967
of the state.

00:15:48.967 --> 00:15:56.200
Precipitation in the west can
be 140 to 160 inches.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.533
That would be this much water.

00:16:02.133 --> 00:16:04.567
In the eastern part of the
state where that air has

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:06.767
climbed over the mountain range
and now it descends

00:16:06.767 --> 00:16:10.500
again, having lost most of its
water, the precipitation is

00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:13.067
less than this amount.

00:16:13.067 --> 00:16:17.200
So that's a big contrast. And
if you drive across there,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.433
boy, you see it immediately
in the vegetation.

00:16:20.433 --> 00:16:25.267
A kind of rainforest here on
the west coast of Oregon.

00:16:25.267 --> 00:16:28.767
You begin to see ponderosa pine,
then they get sparser

00:16:28.767 --> 00:16:29.567
and sparser.

00:16:29.567 --> 00:16:33.200
And by the time you get to
eastern Oregon, there's mostly

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:39.467
grasses and just a scattered
pine tree or so.

00:16:39.467 --> 00:16:42.400
Alaska is another good
example of this.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.967
There's a coastal
mountain range.

00:16:44.967 --> 00:16:46.067
Here's precipitation.

00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:47.967
The purples are the
high precip.

00:16:47.967 --> 00:16:52.567
And you get that moist air
coming off the Pacific Ocean,

00:16:52.567 --> 00:16:54.733
giving you heavy rainfalls
in the mountains.

00:16:54.733 --> 00:16:57.333
And then north of that
and east of that, the

00:16:57.333 --> 00:17:00.600
precipitation dies out
quite quickly.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:03.867
In the north, you're getting
very low precipitation,

00:17:03.867 --> 00:17:06.500
because as I mentioned, the air
that gets to those very

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:11.700
high polar latitudes is cold.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.967
If it's cold, it means that it's
gone through a cooling

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:18.100
process as it moved from
low latitudes.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.867
And the cooling has probably
already removed most of its

00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:21.567
water vapor.

00:17:21.567 --> 00:17:26.567
So cold air, remember, can't
hold very much water vapor.

00:17:26.567 --> 00:17:29.933
And therefore you can't wring
out very much rain from cold

00:17:29.933 --> 00:17:33.567
air, because it doesn't have
very much water to begin with.

00:17:33.567 --> 00:17:37.300
So finding these seemingly
desert-like precipitations--

00:17:40.633 --> 00:17:42.167
200 millimeters, 20
centimeters--

00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:48.933
is a result of the air being too
cold to provide much water

00:17:48.933 --> 00:17:51.800
vapor to that region.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:55.433
Arizona is complicated because
it's got mountains in certain

00:17:55.433 --> 00:17:58.867
areas and low-lying areas, but
this is the mountainous area,

00:17:58.867 --> 00:18:04.000
and pretty much the high
precipitation is controlled by

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.667
the mountains.

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:08.133
But generally, it's a
pretty dry state.

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:10.833
Notice the highest precipitation
here.

00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:12.133
What's that say?

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:15.533
Yeah, the highest precipitation
would be 32

00:18:15.533 --> 00:18:19.267
inches, about this much, up
in the highest mountains.

00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:25.300
I wanted to just mention
this briefly.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.633
Occasionally I like to give you
some idea of what we do in

00:18:28.633 --> 00:18:29.767
our department.

00:18:29.767 --> 00:18:32.167
I've had an interest in
orographic precipitation for a

00:18:32.167 --> 00:18:35.133
number of years, and I noticed
a few years ago that there'd

00:18:35.133 --> 00:18:39.433
been a lot of studies of
it in mid-latitudes

00:18:39.433 --> 00:18:42.033
but none in the tropics.

00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:46.333
So my group put together a field
experiment last May.

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:49.900
I took a leave from Yale
University last April and May

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.333
to do a project down on the
island of Dominica in the

00:18:53.333 --> 00:18:56.067
eastern Caribbean, where we
were looking at orographic

00:18:56.067 --> 00:18:59.133
precipitation in a tropical
location where you have the

00:18:59.133 --> 00:19:01.033
steady trade winds.

00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:06.600
This is a precipitation map for
the island of Dominica.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.933
Upstream over the ocean you get
maybe two millimeters per

00:19:09.933 --> 00:19:11.967
day on average.

00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:16.067
But yet, over the high
mountains, you get 12 to 14

00:19:16.067 --> 00:19:17.333
millimeters per day.

00:19:17.333 --> 00:19:19.467
That's about that much
rain each day, on

00:19:19.467 --> 00:19:20.800
average, over the year.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.233
And then to the west, almost
absolutely dry.

00:19:25.233 --> 00:19:30.467
So a very strong example of
orographic precipitation.

00:19:30.467 --> 00:19:33.867
And we went down there for five
weeks and flew research

00:19:33.867 --> 00:19:37.333
aircraft back and forth over the
island through the clouds,

00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:39.867
trying to understand the details
of how the clouds are

00:19:39.867 --> 00:19:43.567
formed, how the precipitation
is formed, and how this rain

00:19:43.567 --> 00:19:45.633
shadow in the lee comes to be.

00:19:45.633 --> 00:19:47.600
I don't have time to tell you
about the results of that.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.433
But that's the kind of research
that one can do to

00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:53.933
understand in more detail many
of these features that I'm

00:19:53.933 --> 00:19:56.700
just glossing over and saying,
well, look, here's an

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.200
interesting factor, here's an
interesting process, here's an

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.900
interesting part of the Earth.

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.867
They've all got their own
physics, only a small fraction

00:20:04.867 --> 00:20:06.133
of which is really understood.

00:20:06.133 --> 00:20:09.367
So one can chip away at this and
try to understand more and

00:20:09.367 --> 00:20:12.167
more of the details of how
the atmosphere works.

00:20:14.867 --> 00:20:16.133
Questions here?

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.567
So continentality.

00:20:20.567 --> 00:20:21.167
What is that?

00:20:21.167 --> 00:20:26.867
Well, it primarily has to do
with the fact that oceans

00:20:26.867 --> 00:20:33.833
store heat very effectively,
whereas land surfaces do not.

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:37.067
So it's easy to change the
temperature on land.

00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:39.733
You don't have to provide very
much heat or remove very much

00:20:39.733 --> 00:20:43.900
heat to warm up or cool down
a land surface, because

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.533
remember, all you're doing
is heating the first few

00:20:49.533 --> 00:20:53.033
centimeters of the soil.

00:20:53.033 --> 00:20:56.067
And that's not very much
heat capacity.

00:20:56.067 --> 00:20:58.267
So you put in a little bit of
heat, the temperature rises.

00:20:58.267 --> 00:21:00.900
You take out some heat,
the temperature drops.

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.867
You try to do that over
the ocean and two

00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:05.767
things get in the way.

00:21:05.767 --> 00:21:09.067
First of all, water has a
very high heat capacity.

00:21:11.867 --> 00:21:16.333
That is to say, per kilogram,
it's got a large ability to

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:17.500
store heat.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:22.067
Second of all, water is a
liquid, which means it's not

00:21:22.067 --> 00:21:24.467
just the first few centimeters
you have got to cool

00:21:24.467 --> 00:21:25.500
down or heat up.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:28.067
It's probably the first several
hundred meters,

00:21:28.067 --> 00:21:31.933
because that water is constantly
being stirred.

00:21:31.933 --> 00:21:34.733
So you can't just heat or cool
the top few centimeters.

00:21:34.733 --> 00:21:38.667
You've got to heat or cool the
top few hundred meters of the

00:21:38.667 --> 00:21:40.900
ocean, which is an enormous
heat capacity.

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:44.667
So generally temperatures don't
change very much over

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:49.267
the ocean, either between
day and night--

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:53.000
a typical temperature difference
between day and

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.167
night over the ocean is about
a half a degree Celsius,

00:21:58.167 --> 00:22:04.067
whereas on land it could be 5,
10, even in some places 15

00:22:04.067 --> 00:22:09.367
degrees Celsius or higher.

00:22:09.367 --> 00:22:13.367
And between the seasons, between
the warm season and

00:22:13.367 --> 00:22:15.533
the cold season, you've got
a similar difference.

00:22:15.533 --> 00:22:18.633
In the ocean you might only be
able to have a three or four

00:22:18.633 --> 00:22:20.300
degree temperature difference.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:24.400
Over land, you might have 15,
20, 30, 40 degrees Celsius

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.467
difference between winter
and summer.

00:22:26.467 --> 00:22:32.300
So continentality is this
contrast in the heat storage

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:35.200
capability of land
versus ocean.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.967
So here is a plot of the annual
range of temperature.

00:22:38.967 --> 00:22:43.533
It's the typical maximum
temperature versus the minimum

00:22:43.533 --> 00:22:44.100
temperature.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.267
First of all, you don't see much
of a range in the tropics

00:22:47.267 --> 00:22:51.967
anyway, over land or sea,
because there's not that much

00:22:51.967 --> 00:22:54.900
difference in how the
sun hits the tropics

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.867
between winter and summer.

00:22:57.867 --> 00:22:59.300
I'll say more about
that later.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.833
So let's shift our attention
more to mid-latitudes,

00:23:01.833 --> 00:23:04.400
especially to the northern
latitudes where you have a

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.600
couple of very large
continents and

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:07.967
then oceans in between.

00:23:07.967 --> 00:23:11.733
Look, the oceans barely change
their temperature between

00:23:11.733 --> 00:23:14.067
winter and summer, but the
continents change their

00:23:14.067 --> 00:23:15.633
temperature by a great deal.

00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:19.433
For example, up in the northern
part of eastern

00:23:19.433 --> 00:23:23.667
Eurasia, you could have an
annual range of 55--

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:25.500
I think that's in Celsius--

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.467
of 55 degrees between
winter and summer.

00:23:29.467 --> 00:23:31.867
That's an enormous temperature
difference.

00:23:31.867 --> 00:23:35.667
That's sweltering in the summer
and so cold it's hard

00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:38.967
to describe how cold it
is in the wintertime.

00:23:38.967 --> 00:23:41.067
So in the middle of continents,
you get this

00:23:41.067 --> 00:23:42.933
enormous temperature range.

00:23:46.067 --> 00:23:47.000
Continentality.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.467
Any questions on that?

00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:52.533
It's a big player in climate,
as you can imagine.

00:23:52.533 --> 00:23:55.433
You see it in the southern
hemisphere too, but not so

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:57.767
much, because by the time you
get to midlatitudes--

00:23:57.767 --> 00:23:59.633
you know, the big difference
between northern and southern

00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:03.933
hemisphere in this regard is
that the northern hemisphere

00:24:03.933 --> 00:24:07.067
is the hemisphere
of continents.

00:24:07.067 --> 00:24:10.567
The southern hemisphere is more
the hemisphere of oceans.

00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:13.400
The percent land mass is much
greater in the northern

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.733
hemisphere that it is in the
southern hemisphere,

00:24:15.733 --> 00:24:18.667
especially if you're excluding
the equatorial region.

00:24:18.667 --> 00:24:21.367
So by the time you get down to
the mid-latitudes, you really

00:24:21.367 --> 00:24:26.733
only have Australia, New
Zealand, a little bit of

00:24:26.733 --> 00:24:30.267
Africa, and the tip
of South America.

00:24:30.267 --> 00:24:33.100
Whereas in the same latitude
belt in the northern

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.767
hemisphere, you have
massive continents.

00:24:35.767 --> 00:24:38.700
So there's this asymmetry
between the northern and

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:44.033
southern part of our planet,
climate-wise, because of the

00:24:44.033 --> 00:24:47.267
way continentality works
differently in the two

00:24:47.267 --> 00:24:48.533
hemispheres.

00:24:50.467 --> 00:24:55.567
You notice, if you did a zonal
average of this quantity,

00:24:55.567 --> 00:24:58.267
you'd find a much bigger annual
range in the northern

00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:01.267
hemisphere than in the
southern hemisphere.

00:25:01.267 --> 00:25:02.500
Well, that has nothing
to do with how the

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.700
sun hits the Earth.

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.400
Over a year that's pretty much
symmetric between the northern

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.700
and southern hemispheres.

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:11.300
But it has everything to do
with the fact that there's

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.667
more continents in the northern
hemisphere than there

00:25:14.667 --> 00:25:16.400
are in the southern
hemisphere.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.367
Here it is over the United
States, the annual range of

00:25:22.367 --> 00:25:24.067
temperature.

00:25:24.067 --> 00:25:28.000
It's largest in this interior
region of the west, where it's

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.167
dry and high.

00:25:30.167 --> 00:25:34.500
If you have higher elevation,
you tend to have a larger

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:38.267
annual range, because there's
less air above you.

00:25:38.267 --> 00:25:40.833
You can cool down
more at night.

00:25:40.833 --> 00:25:42.200
And it's drier.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.367
There are fewer clouds,
more sunlight.

00:25:44.367 --> 00:25:46.333
It can heat up more
during the day.

00:25:46.333 --> 00:25:50.800
So you see the continentality
here expressed in a little bit

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.767
of a confusing way.

00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:54.500
Because you'd say, well, that
point's just as much in the

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.467
middle of the continent
as that is.

00:25:57.467 --> 00:25:59.333
Yeah, but there are other
things having to do with

00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:05.533
elevation, clouds, that will
cause some change in that

00:26:05.533 --> 00:26:11.967
annual range, even within
the same continent.

00:26:11.967 --> 00:26:16.667
Alaska has a very small annual
range near the ocean.

00:26:16.667 --> 00:26:19.000
Of course that's because it's
close to the ocean, which is

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.400
buffering the temperature.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.100
And then up in the interior,
especially in high latitudes

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.733
where there's a great deal of
difference between summer and

00:26:27.733 --> 00:26:30.500
winter insolation--

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.833
solar radiation--

00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:36.500
you get a very big annual
range in temperature.

00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:41.667
And finally, I'll mention
ocean currents.

00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:43.000
I've shown this diagram
before.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.933
But generally in each of the
ocean basins, you have a

00:26:46.933 --> 00:26:47.933
gyre-- wind-driven gyre.

00:26:47.933 --> 00:26:54.100
But it carries, generally, cold
water near the equator--

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.333
sorry, cold water towards the
equator and warm water away

00:26:57.333 --> 00:27:01.233
from the equator, or we
could say, poleward.

00:27:01.233 --> 00:27:05.733
So if you lived on this side,
along this coast, you'd have a

00:27:05.733 --> 00:27:09.833
cold current off of your beach,
whereas here, you'd

00:27:09.833 --> 00:27:11.500
have a warm current off of it.

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.433
So for example, if you're a
Californian, you've got the

00:27:14.433 --> 00:27:18.133
cold California current coming
down along the coast. That's

00:27:18.133 --> 00:27:20.800
why it's always exciting when
you go swimming in southern

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:21.467
California.

00:27:21.467 --> 00:27:25.667
Beautiful nice warm climate,
beautiful beaches, but be

00:27:25.667 --> 00:27:27.867
prepared for a shock when you
jump in the water, because the

00:27:27.867 --> 00:27:30.033
water's always cold there,
because you've got the

00:27:30.033 --> 00:27:31.167
California current.

00:27:31.167 --> 00:27:34.267
Whereas when I go vacationing
down on Cape Hatteras, for

00:27:34.267 --> 00:27:36.733
example, in the summertime, you
can walk in the water and

00:27:36.733 --> 00:27:40.133
it's very, very pleasant and
warm, because that is warm

00:27:40.133 --> 00:27:42.867
water being brought northwards
in the Gulf Stream.

00:27:42.867 --> 00:27:44.300
So that's a real difference.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.167
And notice that's going to work
oppositely, typically, on

00:27:47.167 --> 00:27:48.767
the two sides of a continent.

00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:51.967
You're going to have cold water
or warm water, depending

00:27:51.967 --> 00:27:55.000
where you fit into that
current scheme.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:55.500
Yeah?

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.900
STUDENT: Why is the cold
water always on the

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.433
left side of the continent?

00:28:00.433 --> 00:28:01.933
PROFESSOR: The question
is, why is the cold

00:28:01.933 --> 00:28:03.133
water always over here?

00:28:03.133 --> 00:28:06.367
Well, these gyres always go--

00:28:06.367 --> 00:28:08.533
notice in the southern
hemisphere, they're always

00:28:08.533 --> 00:28:10.633
going counterclockwise.

00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:12.933
In the northern hemisphere,
they're going clockwise.

00:28:12.933 --> 00:28:15.233
We're going to explain that
later, in terms of how the

00:28:15.233 --> 00:28:17.467
winds drive those currents.

00:28:17.467 --> 00:28:20.500
But you can see that what
they're doing is bringing cold

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.800
water from the pole northward.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:28.033
So once you know the sense of
the gyre, then the sense of

00:28:28.033 --> 00:28:30.933
cold water or warm water
follows exactly.

00:28:30.933 --> 00:28:33.567
So it's only a matter of what
direction are the gyres going.

00:28:33.567 --> 00:28:35.600
And I'll explain that
when I get to the

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.867
ocean currents section.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:45.133
Now I still haven't mentioned
seasons very much.

00:28:45.133 --> 00:28:49.067
What can you do with just the
annual average values?

00:28:49.067 --> 00:28:53.967
This is put together by a couple
of authors that have

00:28:53.967 --> 00:28:58.800
tried to show the relationship
between climate and vegetation

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.233
based on an annual average
values only.

00:29:02.233 --> 00:29:04.700
It's kind of useful, but I'm
going to argue it's not

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:09.267
complete, because it doesn't
include the seasonality.

00:29:09.267 --> 00:29:10.200
But look what they've done.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.000
They've made good progress.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.733
So if you take the annual
average temperature plotted on

00:29:14.733 --> 00:29:19.133
this axis, the annual average
precipitation plotted on the x

00:29:19.133 --> 00:29:22.567
axis-- come along, and then they
have tried to illustrate

00:29:22.567 --> 00:29:27.200
what kind of vegetation you
would get for each of those

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.933
climate zones.

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:32.533
Oh, notice the temperature scale
is reversed here, by the

00:29:32.533 --> 00:29:34.367
way, It gets colder
to the right.

00:29:34.367 --> 00:29:40.767
So tundra, taiga, temperate
deciduous rainforest, tropical

00:29:40.767 --> 00:29:43.633
seasonal forest, all
these things.

00:29:43.633 --> 00:29:45.933
So I enjoy looking at this
diagram, but then I get

00:29:45.933 --> 00:29:50.900
confused because it doesn't
include the seasons in there.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.633
And the seasons really
are needed to do

00:29:52.633 --> 00:29:53.533
a good job of this.

00:29:53.533 --> 00:29:55.133
So be aware of this.

00:29:55.133 --> 00:29:57.467
The concept is called a biome.

00:29:57.467 --> 00:30:02.133
The relationship between climate
and vegetation is

00:30:02.133 --> 00:30:04.100
called the biome concept.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.567
It's a very good concept, but
it doesn't work that well

00:30:07.567 --> 00:30:10.233
unless you include the
seasons, which this

00:30:10.233 --> 00:30:13.733
diagram does not.

00:30:13.733 --> 00:30:19.767
So we are ready to start this
discussion of seasons, which

00:30:19.767 --> 00:30:23.533
will spill over into next
time a little bit.

00:30:23.533 --> 00:30:29.500
I find this to be a very useful
part of the course, a

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.200
very useful subject
to consider.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.900
When I travel around the
world, I like to know--

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:40.867
I like to, first of all,
experience the fact that

00:30:40.867 --> 00:30:42.400
traveling to a different part of
the world is going to give

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.167
me a different climate than
that that I grew up in.

00:30:46.167 --> 00:30:47.167
And I want to understand--

00:30:47.167 --> 00:30:49.167
every place I visit around the
world, I want to understand--

00:30:49.167 --> 00:30:52.367
why is this climate different
and how do the seasons work

00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:53.933
differently?

00:30:53.933 --> 00:30:55.800
In kind of a silly
application--

00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:00.300
I find it useful at the
beginning of the year, when

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.600
I'm coming back to school
seeing my colleagues.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.300
Somebody will say, well, I've
just come back from Ghana, or

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.500
I've just come back from
Melbourne, Australia.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.033
And I ask them, what month
were you there?

00:31:12.033 --> 00:31:15.333
And they tell me and I say
something like, oh, that was

00:31:15.333 --> 00:31:17.533
the dry season, or, oh,
that was the middle

00:31:17.533 --> 00:31:19.000
of the rainy season.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.700
Because once you get--

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.400
I want to give this to you
in the next few minutes--

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.233
once you get this basic picture
of how seasons work,

00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:30.267
which is not too tough, you can
immediately know what's

00:31:30.267 --> 00:31:32.833
going to happen as you travel to
various parts of the world

00:31:32.833 --> 00:31:34.400
in various months of the year.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.633
It's a pretty easy thing once
you get it categorized and

00:31:37.633 --> 00:31:38.233
worked out.

00:31:38.233 --> 00:31:41.300
So that's the understanding
we're striving for here.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:46.667
How do the seasons work in
different parts of the world?

00:31:46.667 --> 00:31:52.700
So just five bullet points
concerning seasons.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.167
What causes the seasons on
Earth is the tilt of the

00:31:55.167 --> 00:31:58.467
Earth's axis, 23 and a half
degrees currently.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.933
So that when the-- and that
tilt is measured--

00:32:04.933 --> 00:32:07.633
what's it measured from?

00:32:07.633 --> 00:32:09.733
It's measured from the plane
of the ecliptic.

00:32:09.733 --> 00:32:12.133
The plane of the ecliptic is
that plane in which the Earth

00:32:12.133 --> 00:32:14.133
moves in its orbit.

00:32:14.133 --> 00:32:18.567
That is our reference plane,
and relative to that plane,

00:32:18.567 --> 00:32:21.433
the tilt is measured, the
tilt of the Earth

00:32:21.433 --> 00:32:25.100
spinning on its axis.

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.233
For this reason, because it's a
tilt effect, during part of

00:32:29.233 --> 00:32:31.200
the year the northern hemisphere
is tilted towards

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:34.300
the sun, and part of the Earth
is tilted away from the sun.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.733
So the seasons are opposite
in the two hemispheres.

00:32:37.733 --> 00:32:40.100
When it's winter in the north,
it's summer in the south, and

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.467
vice versa.

00:32:42.467 --> 00:32:45.200
That's the primary effect of it
being a tilt effect, is you

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.800
get those opposite
seasonalities.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:50.067
Now there is another effect.

00:32:50.067 --> 00:32:56.533
The Earth's orbit is slightly
elliptical, which means for a

00:32:56.533 --> 00:32:59.833
few months a year, we're a
little bit closer to the sun.

00:32:59.833 --> 00:33:01.800
For a few months of the year
we're a little bit further

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.700
away from the sun.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.433
That in and of itself would
cause a slight seasonality on

00:33:08.433 --> 00:33:10.300
planet Earth.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.500
It'd be warmer when we're closer
to the sun, a little

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.267
cooler when we're
further away.

00:33:16.267 --> 00:33:19.900
(A) that's a pretty
small effect.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.567
And (b) note that if that were
the dominant effect, that

00:33:23.567 --> 00:33:27.233
would cause simultaneous seasons
in both hemispheres.

00:33:27.233 --> 00:33:30.333
It'd be summer in both
hemispheres at the same time

00:33:30.333 --> 00:33:33.800
and winter in both hemispheres
at the same time.

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:37.433
So this does not explain the
basic thing we know about

00:33:37.433 --> 00:33:41.233
seasons, in that it's primarily
reversed in the two

00:33:41.233 --> 00:33:43.133
hemispheres.

00:33:43.133 --> 00:33:44.367
Any questions on that?

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.700
OK, now before I go any further,
I just want to

00:33:50.700 --> 00:34:03.633
illustrate the basic idea here
about how the tilt of the

00:34:03.633 --> 00:34:04.900
Earth does it.

00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:12.133
I'm going to darken things off
just for a minute, and we'll

00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:13.900
do a little globe
experiment here.

00:34:20.767 --> 00:34:25.033
Can I set this right here?

00:34:25.033 --> 00:34:26.200
So here's the Earth.

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:33.267
And the sun's over
there of course.

00:34:33.267 --> 00:34:40.667
So as it goes around the sun,
the orientation of that tilt

00:34:40.667 --> 00:34:42.533
remains fixed.

00:34:42.533 --> 00:34:45.567
So as it goes around its orbit,
notice the orientation

00:34:45.567 --> 00:34:48.467
of my pencil stays fixed.

00:34:48.467 --> 00:34:49.567
That's important.

00:34:49.567 --> 00:34:51.333
That arises from the
principle of

00:34:51.333 --> 00:34:53.400
conservation of angular momentum.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.200
Angular momentum is the quantity
that the Earth has

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:56.967
when it spins.

00:34:56.967 --> 00:34:59.400
It's a vector quantity pointing

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.500
in a certain direction.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.500
And that doesn't change.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:05.933
You might have thought that as
the Earth goes around, maybe

00:35:05.933 --> 00:35:09.833
it somehow does something
like this.

00:35:09.833 --> 00:35:10.433
But no, no.

00:35:10.433 --> 00:35:13.733
That orientation stays fixed
as it goes around.

00:35:13.733 --> 00:35:16.967
So when it's on one side of the
sun, it's like this, and

00:35:16.967 --> 00:35:19.500
when it's on the other side of
the sun, it's like this.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:22.500
So remember, it's that constant
orientation of the

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.767
rotation axis that
is important in

00:35:24.767 --> 00:35:25.867
understanding the seasons.

00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:31.167
So let's start with an
orientation like this where

00:35:31.167 --> 00:35:35.467
the tilt is oriented such that
it's across the direction of

00:35:35.467 --> 00:35:36.133
the sun's rays.

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:41.433
Now, September 21st, just
two weeks ago--

00:35:41.433 --> 00:35:44.300
I think it was on the day you
took your exam actually--

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.667
on that day, that was the
autumnal equinox.

00:35:48.667 --> 00:35:51.200
That's when the Earth had
this orientation.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:55.033
That tilt was, in a way
perpendicular to a line

00:35:55.033 --> 00:35:57.667
between the sun and the Earth,
so that as the Earth spun on

00:35:57.667 --> 00:36:01.233
its axis, it had equal
day and night

00:36:01.233 --> 00:36:04.133
everywhere around the globe.

00:36:04.133 --> 00:36:09.167
Now we are moving towards
December 21st, which will be

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:15.167
the winter solstice, and on that
day the orientation of

00:36:15.167 --> 00:36:18.900
the Earth will be like that
relative to the sun.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.833
Can you all see that?

00:36:19.833 --> 00:36:25.167
So when it spins on its axis
again towards the east, the

00:36:25.167 --> 00:36:27.800
southern hemisphere is receiving
a lot of heat, the

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:30.967
northern hemisphere is receiving
less, and the north

00:36:30.967 --> 00:36:32.667
pole is getting none.

00:36:32.667 --> 00:36:35.833
Notice this is completely in
shadow back here, because of

00:36:35.833 --> 00:36:37.767
that direction.

00:36:37.767 --> 00:36:44.433
Three months after that at the
spring equinox, it'll be like

00:36:44.433 --> 00:36:46.067
this again.

00:36:46.067 --> 00:36:51.467
And then on June 21st, the
summer solstice, that will be

00:36:51.467 --> 00:36:55.333
the orientation of the Earth
relative to the sun.

00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:59.167
And the north pole will have
sunlight 24 hours a day.

00:36:59.167 --> 00:37:00.900
The south pole will have none.

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.233
A lot of radiation in the
northern hemisphere.

00:37:03.233 --> 00:37:05.133
Less in the southern hemisphere,
because it's

00:37:05.133 --> 00:37:06.533
tilted away.

00:37:06.533 --> 00:37:09.167
And that is the cycle
we go through.

00:37:09.167 --> 00:37:12.333
Remember, it all rises again,
because as the Earth goes

00:37:12.333 --> 00:37:17.000
around in its orbit, that
orientation of the axis stays

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.133
fixed as it goes
around the sun.

00:37:20.133 --> 00:37:25.333
That's the key ingredient
there.

00:37:25.333 --> 00:37:26.567
Any questions on that?

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.133
You've probably had that in high
school, but there was a

00:37:33.133 --> 00:37:40.000
survey done about 15 years ago
of graduating Harvard seniors.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.667
And they were asked, what
makes the seasons.

00:37:44.667 --> 00:37:48.567
And a shockingly small
percentage--

00:37:48.567 --> 00:37:51.533
this was done, actually, as
they marched into their

00:37:51.533 --> 00:37:52.833
graduation ceremony--

00:37:52.833 --> 00:37:57.100
a shockingly small percentage
could explain that it was the

00:37:57.100 --> 00:37:59.067
tilt of the Earth and
so on and so forth.

00:37:59.067 --> 00:38:02.433
I don't want to that
to happen at Yale.

00:38:02.433 --> 00:38:07.933
So you've got the message, and
spread it around, because how

00:38:07.933 --> 00:38:09.367
can you live on this planet, I
ask you, how can you live on

00:38:09.367 --> 00:38:12.267
this planet without
understanding that most basic

00:38:12.267 --> 00:38:15.467
concept of how the
seasons work?

00:38:18.633 --> 00:38:19.867
Questions there?

00:38:22.333 --> 00:38:22.667
OK.

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:25.633
Now, a few other points.

00:38:25.633 --> 00:38:27.833
What this does--

00:38:27.833 --> 00:38:31.300
this shift of the radiation from
hemisphere to hemisphere

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.900
moves all of these belts and
zones along with them.

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:40.033
So we've talked about the ITCZ,
the belt of deserts to

00:38:40.033 --> 00:38:43.400
the north to south of that,
the belts of storms to the

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.833
north and south of that.

00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:49.933
Imagine that whole set of
systems shifting northwards in

00:38:49.933 --> 00:38:53.367
the summertime for the northern
hemisphere, and

00:38:53.367 --> 00:38:56.900
shifting southwards for the
summer in the southern

00:38:56.900 --> 00:38:58.100
hemisphere.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.533
That's probably the easiest way
to understand how climate

00:39:01.533 --> 00:39:05.533
works on our planet, is to
envision that the general

00:39:05.533 --> 00:39:10.000
circulation is driven by the
sun, and therefore if, because

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.467
of the tilt of the Earth's axis,
you move most of the

00:39:13.467 --> 00:39:17.633
radiation into the northern
hemisphere, everything's going

00:39:17.633 --> 00:39:18.900
to move with it.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.333
If you move it into the
southern hemisphere,

00:39:21.333 --> 00:39:23.600
everything's going to move
southward into it.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.800
Now I will try to describe
that in various ways.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.900
But you've got to understand
it well enough to sketch it

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.733
into your notes there.

00:39:34.733 --> 00:39:37.667
So again this is just a picture
of the sun going

00:39:37.667 --> 00:39:39.533
around the Earth--

00:39:39.533 --> 00:39:41.567
no, the Earth going
around the sun.

00:39:44.433 --> 00:39:48.433
Going back to the old geocentric
view of the

00:39:48.433 --> 00:39:51.833
universe here briefly.

00:39:51.833 --> 00:39:55.633
The Earth going around the sun,
thank you, and keeping

00:39:55.633 --> 00:40:00.867
that orientation of that axis
fixed as it does so.

00:40:00.867 --> 00:40:06.933
So if you're looking sideways at
the plane of the ecliptic,

00:40:06.933 --> 00:40:12.067
the Earth here in grey is
moving in and out of the

00:40:12.067 --> 00:40:17.500
board, going around in its orbit
staying in that ecliptic

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:23.633
plane and with a fixed
axis-- a fixed tilt

00:40:23.633 --> 00:40:26.867
to its axis of rotation.

00:40:26.867 --> 00:40:32.467
If you're on the Earth, in
kind of an Earth-fixed

00:40:32.467 --> 00:40:35.033
coordinate system, it seems
to you like the

00:40:35.033 --> 00:40:37.633
sun is actually moving.

00:40:37.633 --> 00:40:41.233
In the summertime it seems
to be up high in the sky.

00:40:41.233 --> 00:40:43.733
In the winter time it's
lower in the sky.

00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:44.833
Of course that's not true.

00:40:44.833 --> 00:40:49.000
It's just the fact that the axis
of the Earth is tilted.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.833
For example, if you're at 41
degrees north latitude, as we

00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:59.333
are here in New Haven, in the
summertime at the summer

00:40:59.333 --> 00:41:04.933
solstice, the sun at noon would
be 23 and a half degrees

00:41:04.933 --> 00:41:09.133
above the equator, which
means it's never

00:41:09.133 --> 00:41:10.700
overhead here in New Haven.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:15.267
But that solar zenith angle
is not very great.

00:41:15.267 --> 00:41:19.033
You'd have to subtract 23 from
41 to get the solar zenith

00:41:19.033 --> 00:41:22.800
angle at noon on the
21st of June.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.833
On the 21st of December at noon,
the sun is down here.

00:41:26.833 --> 00:41:28.267
We're still in New Haven.

00:41:28.267 --> 00:41:34.133
The solar zenith angle would
then be 41 degrees plus 23.

00:41:34.133 --> 00:41:34.600
What's that?

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.633
64 degrees.

00:41:36.633 --> 00:41:43.167
The sun at noon is 64 degrees
below your zenith point.

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:45.400
And that has big influences,
of course, on the amount of

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.367
radiation received because
of that cosine factor.

00:41:48.367 --> 00:41:51.300
It's the cosine of the zenith
angle that determines how much

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:56.733
radiation is being received per
unit area on the Earth.

00:41:56.733 --> 00:41:57.967
And that's shown here.

00:41:57.967 --> 00:42:02.567
So when the sun is above, you
get the full solar radiance.

00:42:02.567 --> 00:42:05.800
When it's at some solar zenith
angle, it's the solar constant

00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.833
times the cosine of the
solar zenith angle.

00:42:08.833 --> 00:42:15.367
So the greater that off-zenith
angle is, the smaller is the

00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:19.433
cosine and the less radiation
you receive.

00:42:19.433 --> 00:42:23.100
So that cosine effect is another
important way to

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:27.533
understand how the
seasons work.

00:42:27.533 --> 00:42:30.000
I did mention, however, this
other effect, this

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.267
non-circular aspect to
the Earth's orbit.

00:42:35.267 --> 00:42:39.500
And it's shown a little bit
exaggerated in this diagram.

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.667
But at the present time,
the perihelion--

00:42:43.667 --> 00:42:46.100
the day of the year when we're
closest to the sun--

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.333
is the third of January.

00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:49.400
The aphelion--

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.833
when we're furthest away
from the sun-- is

00:42:50.833 --> 00:42:52.533
the fourth of July.

00:42:52.533 --> 00:42:56.667
And notice what that would
do, and in fact does do.

00:42:56.667 --> 00:42:59.600
If this were the only effect,
it would make January a

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:04.400
slightly warmer month
than July.

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.900
So in the northern hemisphere,
when January is a cold month

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:12.867
because of the tilt of the
Earth, this would slightly

00:43:12.867 --> 00:43:16.633
reduce the seasonality.

00:43:16.633 --> 00:43:21.233
In the southern hemisphere, when
July is normally a cold

00:43:21.233 --> 00:43:25.833
month, this effect
would strengthen

00:43:25.833 --> 00:43:27.633
the seasonality slightly.

00:43:27.633 --> 00:43:31.933
Now, this is a small effect,
but if you want to think

00:43:31.933 --> 00:43:36.067
through what it's going to do,
with the current perihelion

00:43:36.067 --> 00:43:43.567
being in January, it's going to
weaken northern hemisphere

00:43:43.567 --> 00:43:48.433
seasons a little bit and
strengthen southern hemisphere

00:43:48.433 --> 00:43:49.333
seasons a little bit.

00:43:49.333 --> 00:43:52.467
We're going to revisit this when
we talk about the theory

00:43:52.467 --> 00:43:58.733
of the ice ages, where it's
believed that changes in this

00:43:58.733 --> 00:44:01.833
situation may have triggered
the coming and

00:44:01.833 --> 00:44:03.167
going of the ice ages.

00:44:03.167 --> 00:44:05.767
But at the current time I want
to emphasize that this is a

00:44:05.767 --> 00:44:08.367
pretty small effect.

00:44:08.367 --> 00:44:11.733
You can do a pretty good job of
understanding the seasons

00:44:11.733 --> 00:44:16.533
on Earth without even knowing
about this effect.

00:44:16.533 --> 00:44:19.667
You'd get it about 90% right.

00:44:19.667 --> 00:44:24.800
So if you're at a particular
latitude and you go through

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:28.367
the months, how does the
insolation vary?

00:44:28.367 --> 00:44:31.533
So what's shown here are four
different latitudes--

00:44:31.533 --> 00:44:35.233
the equator, and then three
latitudes in the northern

00:44:35.233 --> 00:44:36.167
hemisphere.

00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:39.233
And what's plotted is the solar
insolation averaged over

00:44:39.233 --> 00:44:42.567
a day in watts per
square meter.

00:44:42.567 --> 00:44:45.767
Let's start with
the north pole.

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:54.167
Near the summer solstice, you're
getting about 500 watts

00:44:54.167 --> 00:44:57.933
per square meter averaged
over a day.

00:44:57.933 --> 00:45:01.200
It drops very rapidly as you go
later in the year, and at a

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.867
certain point it drops
altogether.

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:06.267
You get perpetual nighttime.

00:45:06.267 --> 00:45:09.367
The sun never appears
in the sky.

00:45:09.367 --> 00:45:11.300
As you go to lower latitudes--

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.733
remember the Arctic Circle,
because the tilt of the

00:45:13.733 --> 00:45:17.467
Earth's axis is 23 and a half
degrees, the Arctic Circle is

00:45:17.467 --> 00:45:20.600
66 and a half, right?

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.567
66 and a half.

00:45:23.567 --> 00:45:28.433
So at 60 degrees, we're already
southward of the

00:45:28.433 --> 00:45:29.700
Arctic Circle.

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:33.800
And so we don't quite get
darkness all day long, but the

00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:37.067
amount of radiation received is
very small in the middle of

00:45:37.067 --> 00:45:38.167
the winter.

00:45:38.167 --> 00:45:43.800
And then when you get all the
way down to the equator, the

00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:46.767
insolation received is almost
constant with the year.

00:45:46.767 --> 00:45:53.000
Notice that for a few weeks,
averaged over a day, the north

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.200
pole actually receives more
than the equator does, but

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.700
it's a very brief thing.

00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.033
And for the most part, if you
look at the total area under

00:46:01.033 --> 00:46:05.700
the blue curve, which is the
equator, versus the area under

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.233
the yellow curve, which is the
pole, much more radiation is

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:13.600
received at the equator
than at the pole.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:19.567
So this is a nice diagram for
remembering that it's the

00:46:19.567 --> 00:46:23.533
amount of sunlight that's
received that's the key issue

00:46:23.533 --> 00:46:28.267
here with the seasonality.

00:46:28.267 --> 00:46:29.533
Questions here?

00:46:31.867 --> 00:46:32.233
OK.

00:46:32.233 --> 00:46:38.100
So back on this idea of the
belts moving seasonally,

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.300
quote, "following the sun." This
is an expression which is

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.833
just meant to help make it
easier to remember this.

00:46:44.833 --> 00:46:46.233
They follow the sun.

00:46:46.233 --> 00:46:47.567
That is, when there's more
sunlight hitting the northern

00:46:47.567 --> 00:46:50.667
hemisphere, things move north.

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:52.733
South, south-- it works
the opposite way.

00:46:52.733 --> 00:46:56.033
So here's a little cartoon
I put together.

00:46:56.033 --> 00:47:01.867
So, for June, July, and August,
when the northern

00:47:01.867 --> 00:47:09.800
hemisphere is tilted towards
the sun, first of all, the

00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.733
polar front is very weak.

00:47:12.733 --> 00:47:21.767
And that's because the amount
of radiation is almost the

00:47:21.767 --> 00:47:25.133
same between the pole
and the equator.

00:47:25.133 --> 00:47:29.467
So there's not very much
differential heating in the

00:47:29.467 --> 00:47:32.567
southern-- sorry in the
summer hemisphere.

00:47:32.567 --> 00:47:35.400
And in June, July, and August,
the northern hemisphere is the

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.467
summer hemisphere.

00:47:37.467 --> 00:47:40.933
The ITCZ, which we've been
talking about being located at

00:47:40.933 --> 00:47:46.933
the equator, actually shifts
northwards several degrees.

00:47:46.933 --> 00:47:49.333
And the frontal storms in the
southern hemisphere become

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:50.567
very strong.

00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:58.933
And the polar front moves a
little bit northward as well.

00:47:58.933 --> 00:48:01.100
Six months later--

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:02.800
December, January, February--

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:06.600
when the southern hemisphere
is receiving most of the

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:10.433
radiation, the frontal storms in
the northern hemisphere are

00:48:10.433 --> 00:48:14.033
very strong, because remember,
there's no radiation reaching

00:48:14.033 --> 00:48:16.100
the north pole, and
a lot of radiation

00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:16.833
reaching the equator.

00:48:16.833 --> 00:48:19.833
So a lot of differential
heating.

00:48:19.833 --> 00:48:23.133
In the southern hemisphere, the
ITCZ shifts southwards,

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:26.633
and you have weak frontal
storms in the southern

00:48:26.633 --> 00:48:29.833
hemisphere, because there's very
little difference between

00:48:29.833 --> 00:48:33.100
the solar insolation
here and there.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:37.800
So that's the cartoon that's
going to guide us through the

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.600
next lecture, really.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:42.567
We're out of time today.

00:48:42.567 --> 00:48:45.000
But try to make some
sense of this.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.700
Try to think through it.

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.200
And then I'm going to show you
to what extent this simple

00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:53.033
idea is applicable to
the real world.

00:48:53.033 --> 00:48:54.267
And that'll be next time.

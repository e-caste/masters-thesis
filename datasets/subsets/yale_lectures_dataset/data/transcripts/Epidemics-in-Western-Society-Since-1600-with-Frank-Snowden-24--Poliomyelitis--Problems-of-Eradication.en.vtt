00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.000
Prof: Good morning.
 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.670
We can start.
 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.706
Today we'll be discussing
poliomyelitis,

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:09.880
or polio for short.
 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.995
And you may be wondering why
we've included it at this point,

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:16.190
late in the day in our course.
 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.744
And that's because a number of
you have been saying that you'd

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:24.925
like to have the course come
right up to date and today's

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:29.188
newspapers,
and the way I want to deal with

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:33.415
polio,
I hope, is in light of that

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:34.560
request.
 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.796
In other words,
we're going to be dealing with

00:00:37.796 --> 00:00:42.981
polio at this very moment;
and in particular with problems

00:00:42.981 --> 00:00:47.482
of vaccination,
that very major public health

00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:48.710
strategy.
 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.927
The subject will really be the
problems facing the Global Polio

00:00:53.927 --> 00:00:58.469
Eradication Initiative which,
just to remind you,

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.630
is the largest public health
campaign ever launched.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.078
It predicted global eradication
by 2000.

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:14.947
And when it began in 1988 it
used as its model the

00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:20.610
eradication of smallpox,
as you know pioneered long ago

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.260
by Edward Jenner,
and actually reaching

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.284
successful conclusion in 1980
when the World Health

00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:34.712
Organization certified that the
world globe was free of

00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:38.129
naturally occurring smallpox.
 

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:42.944
There seemed to be a number of
reasons that smallpox could be

00:01:42.944 --> 00:01:44.629
taken as the model.
 

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:49.215
This was the first disease,
and still the only one,

00:01:49.215 --> 00:01:52.242
major disease,
actually eradicated

00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:58.019
intentionally by human beings,
by a public health campaign.

00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:03.912
It was thought that polio had a
number of features that made it

00:02:03.912 --> 00:02:08.568
a similarly good candidate,
just like smallpox.

00:02:08.568 --> 00:02:11.036
It was a disease,
like smallpox,

00:02:11.036 --> 00:02:13.979
that possessed no animal
reservoir.

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:18.163
So, if you got rid of it in the
human population,

00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:23.395
it wouldn't again jump species
and recur through transmission

00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:25.750
from animals to humans.
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.461
It was also a viral disease,
and the pathogen has no

00:02:30.461 --> 00:02:32.680
complicated lifecycle.
 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.991
It's at the other end of the
spectrum from,

00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:38.990
for example,
the malarial plasmodia.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.848
The acquired resistance is
robust, produced by the body

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:46.150
naturally.
 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.560
That was true of polio,
as it is of smallpox.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.782
And it was the case that just
as in the example of smallpox,

00:02:58.782 --> 00:03:05.319
so too with polio there seemed
to be a very robust and powerful

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.358
tool;
that is, two vaccines,

00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:13.770
one injected--we'll come back
to that--and the other oral,

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.860
the polio vaccines.
 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.278
But as we speak,
the global eradication program

00:03:20.278 --> 00:03:25.180
has run into serious and
unexpected difficulties.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.878
After it was originally
launched in 1988,

00:03:28.878 --> 00:03:33.408
it went from success to
success, and seemed to be poised

00:03:33.408 --> 00:03:38.645
for successful eradication,
if perhaps not by its original

00:03:38.645 --> 00:03:43.198
timetable of 2000,
well then perhaps just a little

00:03:43.198 --> 00:03:44.160
bit later.
 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.788
But in 2003 major difficulties
overtook the campaign--

00:03:49.788 --> 00:03:55.041
and we'll come back to
those--and now the campaign is a

00:03:55.041 --> 00:04:00.633
decade behind schedule,
and the elusive goal of global

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:04.210
eradication seems to be
receding,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.968
rather than becoming closer.
 

00:04:06.968 --> 00:04:11.930
It stalled particularly in four
endemic countries--

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.699
India, Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Nigeria--

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.279
and even spread,
particularly from Nigeria,

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:24.209
to an array of other countries.
 

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:29.519
So, the question is whether
this stalling is temporary and

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:33.990
for contingent reasons likely to
be overcome,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.540
or was eradication on the
smallpox model a mirage from the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.319
start?
 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:45.690
And this can be personified in
a major debate between two

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.389
leading figures in international
public health.

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.036
One is Bruce Aylward,
who's the director general of

00:04:56.036 --> 00:05:01.569
the Global Public Polio
Eradication Initiative.

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:05.896
He's a great optimist,
and says that the problem is

00:05:05.896 --> 00:05:11.350
simply a matter of pressing
harder when difficulties emerge,

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:16.819
and he envisages eradication in
short order.

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:22.430
Then there's D.A. Henderson,
and he was the former director

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.459
of the successful Smallpox
Eradication Program,

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:32.163
and he was the director of
polio eradication in the region

00:05:32.163 --> 00:05:33.649
of the Americas.
 

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:37.879
Originally he was a very
enthusiastic eradicator,

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:43.077
but now he's come round to the
view instead that eradication

00:05:43.077 --> 00:05:46.779
was a mistaken concept from the
start;

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:52.053
that it will simply never work
with polio, which is totally

00:05:52.053 --> 00:05:53.690
unlike smallpox.
 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.995
This morning,
fortunately,

00:05:55.995 --> 00:06:00.978
we don't need to make a
decision, and hopefully Aylward

00:06:00.978 --> 00:06:03.100
will be successful.
 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.812
But I do think we need to
understand how difficult the

00:06:07.812 --> 00:06:12.790
eradication of a disease
actually is, and to remember how

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:16.170
exceptional smallpox is as a
case.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.444
Polio reminds us that smallpox
was an outlier,

00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:22.629
rather than the norm.
 

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:25.271
Furthermore,
the polio problem is

00:06:25.271 --> 00:06:30.230
intellectually interesting,
and we ought to understand it

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.764
in order to comprehend
tomorrow's press reports on why

00:06:34.764 --> 00:06:38.100
eradication perhaps didn't
succeed,

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.149
if that's the outcome.
 

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:43.677
I don't want to make a
prediction because I'm mindful

00:06:43.677 --> 00:06:49.144
of that great sage,
Yogi Berra, who had a saying,

00:06:49.144 --> 00:06:55.410
"never make a prediction,
especially if it's about the

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.350
future."
 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.411
In any case,
we don't know whether polio

00:06:59.411 --> 00:07:01.610
will be eradicated or not.
 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.120
I tend to be a skeptic,
but I really hope I'm wrong.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.639
The poliovirus has three types,
polio 1,

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:17.540
2 and 3, and it enters the body
via the mouth,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.939
perhaps through contaminated
food or water,

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:29.120
or in unsanitary conditions
with direct contact with stools,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.000
or with the secretions from the
throat of a patient.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.723
The virus then settles in the
intestinal tract and it

00:07:38.723 --> 00:07:40.449
multiplies there.
 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:45.170
And that's a picture of the
poliovirus.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.483
After an incubation period of
one to five days,

00:07:49.483 --> 00:07:55.112
it then settles in lymphatic
tissue, along the intestines and

00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:57.269
in the lymph nodes.
 

00:07:57.269 --> 00:08:01.658
Now, normally the virus does no
appreciable harm in the

00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:05.153
digestive tract,
producing nothing more than

00:08:05.153 --> 00:08:07.509
some swollen lymph nodes.
 

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:11.990
And apart from that,
the infection can be totally

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:13.389
asymptomatic.
 

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:18.060
In some cases it leads to minor
symptoms--

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.300
these are brief--such as a mild
fever,

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.346
and other symptoms that would
make you think of seasonal

00:08:26.346 --> 00:08:31.069
influenza: headache,
nausea, vomiting.

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:38.058
Then the patient recovers with
nothing more occurring.

00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:42.667
And that's true then of the
vast majority of cases that end

00:08:42.667 --> 00:08:43.779
in that way.
 

00:08:43.779 --> 00:08:49.206
And indeed, in the historical
literature, this was termed

00:08:49.206 --> 00:08:53.470
abortive poliomyelitis,
because the infection

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.990
progressed no further.
 

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.230
But in about one percent or so
of cases,

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.019
there's something much more
serious that occurs,

00:09:05.019 --> 00:09:09.028
which is the involvement of the
central nervous system,

00:09:09.028 --> 00:09:13.759
and that's where the disease,
if it becomes so established,

00:09:13.759 --> 00:09:16.769
does its serious damage.
 

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:21.427
It destroys nerves,
especially in the spinal cord

00:09:21.427 --> 00:09:22.980
and the brain.
 

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:30.238
Let me show you a rather--a
schematic--rather scary picture

00:09:30.238 --> 00:09:35.620
of the poliovirus attacking a
nerve cell.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:41.133
When this occurs,
the results are severe pain,

00:09:41.133 --> 00:09:46.769
weakness in the muscles,
and then paralysis;

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:51.755
and the paralysis can be one
leg, both legs,

00:09:51.755 --> 00:09:56.279
the arms, and the respiratory
system.

00:09:56.279 --> 00:10:00.460
The paralysis also is normally
irreversible,

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:06.001
and often leads to very severe
deformity or maiming of the

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:07.850
affected limbs.
 

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:12.701
If the muscles involved are
those of the respiratory system,

00:10:12.701 --> 00:10:16.980
the result can be respiratory
paralysis and death.

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:24.740
Let me show you some images of
the work of poliomyelitis.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:29.988
This is a picture from the
1950s of a child in

00:10:29.988 --> 00:10:34.070
rehabilitation,
with paralyzed legs,

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.870
braces and calipers.
 

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:43.520
Or we can see this is a poster
of the campaign against

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.529
poliomyelitis.
 

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:51.379
Or this is the iron lung that
was used to save the lives of

00:10:51.379 --> 00:10:56.423
those who had respiratory
paralysis, and we can see

00:10:56.423 --> 00:11:00.658
another iron lung with a child
inside.

00:11:00.658 --> 00:11:05.240
And a terrible picture,
that was all too common in the

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.905
thirties, forties and fifties,
which is a whole ward of

00:11:09.905 --> 00:11:12.240
children in iron lungs.
 

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.890
So, this really was a terrible
and cataclysmic disease in its

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.210
severe form.
 

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.908
What about the history?
 

00:11:20.908 --> 00:11:28.580
Poliomyelitis used to be called
"infantile paralysis."

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.458
Until the 1890s,
it was regarded as a minor

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:35.600
medical and public health issue.
 

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:40.452
It really exploded onto the
world as a major public health

00:11:40.452 --> 00:11:43.860
and medical problem only in the
1890s.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.326
That's not to say that polio
was an emerging disease of the

00:11:48.326 --> 00:11:50.889
1890s,
but I'm going to say that

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:55.005
something new happened that
transformed awareness of the

00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:55.830
disease.
 

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:01.456
It was thought then originally
to be an exotic and unimportant

00:12:01.456 --> 00:12:04.870
endemic disease of early
childhood.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:10.260
But something happened in the
1890s, and polio began to appear

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.503
as something different,
especially in the Western

00:12:14.503 --> 00:12:16.360
industrial world.
 

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.548
It began to appear as a
virulent epidemic disease.

00:12:21.548 --> 00:12:25.604
It struck older groups of
people, adolescents and

00:12:25.604 --> 00:12:29.996
grownups, as well as infants,
and in its wake it left

00:12:29.996 --> 00:12:33.629
clusters of dead and paralyzed
victims.

00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:38.894
The first substantial epidemics
ever recorded struck

00:12:38.894 --> 00:12:42.610
Scandinavia, Sweden,
in the 1890s;

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:46.389
in this country Vermont,
in 1894;

00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:51.620
Scandinavia again in 1905;
New York in 1907;

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:57.181
Vienna in 1908;
and the northeast of the United

00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:01.139
States in a devastating epidemic
in 1916.

00:13:01.139 --> 00:13:05.883
After that, epidemics of polio
became a recurring and

00:13:05.883 --> 00:13:11.629
terrifying feature of the warm
months of the industrial West.

00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:13.759
In the U.S.,
for example,

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:17.490
polio struck with ever
increasing fury,

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:24.250
reaching a peak of ferocity in
the years 1950 to 1954,

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:29.769
and by that time it had taken
over from tuberculosis as the

00:13:29.769 --> 00:13:32.909
most feared disease of the era.
 

00:13:32.909 --> 00:13:35.168
Well, what happened?
 

00:13:35.168 --> 00:13:38.038
And here I think we ought to be
careful.

00:13:38.038 --> 00:13:42.244
Let's avoid an error that
misled epidemiologists and

00:13:42.244 --> 00:13:46.860
public health officials,
at least until World War II,

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:52.070
and that sometimes has misled
medical historians since then.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:57.592
The mistake was to think that
polio was in some simple way a

00:13:57.592 --> 00:14:01.525
disease of the affluent
industrial nations,

00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:06.019
of the clean and the prosperous
within them.

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:11.610
In reality, poliovirus,
as we know, is transmitted by

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:17.091
the oral-fecal route,
and it was ubiquitous in human

00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:20.639
populations across the globe.
 

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:26.269
But hygienic advances
transformed its epidemiology.

00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:30.863
The sanitary bulwarks of the
modern industrial state

00:14:30.863 --> 00:14:35.547
prevented children from
encountering the virus during

00:14:35.547 --> 00:14:41.548
infancy and early childhood,
and therefore they failed to

00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:46.200
build an acquired immunity to
the disease.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.528
As a result,
the numbers of susceptible

00:14:49.528 --> 00:14:53.470
people in populations began to
accumulate,

00:14:53.470 --> 00:15:00.461
and that provided the basis for
periodic large-scale epidemics

00:15:00.461 --> 00:15:03.668
that struck at later ages.
 

00:15:03.668 --> 00:15:08.758
There was a distinguished Yale
epidemiologist named John Paul

00:15:08.758 --> 00:15:13.592
who was very active in the
middle decades of the twentieth

00:15:13.592 --> 00:15:17.240
century in dealing with
poliomyelitis,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:22.445
and he argued that the disease
should no longer be called

00:15:22.445 --> 00:15:24.490
infantile paralysis.
 

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.210
Under the circumstances,
he said, that term should be

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:31.928
replaced with the phrase
"modern polio."

00:15:31.928 --> 00:15:34.676
And modern polio,
as he called it,

00:15:34.676 --> 00:15:38.669
demonstrated a strong
predilection for relatively

00:15:38.669 --> 00:15:43.105
prosperous older children,
adolescents and adults,

00:15:43.105 --> 00:15:47.298
and it did so in the
economically advanced nations of

00:15:47.298 --> 00:15:51.000
the world: Northern Europe,
North America,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.058
Australia, New Zealand.
 

00:15:53.058 --> 00:15:57.384
Polio, in this sense,
what John Paul called modern

00:15:57.384 --> 00:16:00.388
polio,
seemed to be--if we could toy

00:16:00.388 --> 00:16:04.500
with a phrase that's all too
familiar to you by now--

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:09.580
it seemed to be a kind of
social disease in reverse.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:15.125
That is, it seemed to cause
epidemics among the clean,

00:16:15.125 --> 00:16:18.370
the wealthy and the suburban.
 

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:23.581
And, so, polio became a highly
visible epidemic disease that

00:16:23.581 --> 00:16:26.664
terrified,
because it was so visible,

00:16:26.664 --> 00:16:30.980
because there was no cure,
and because everyone seemed to

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:34.515
be vulnerable,
while the disease itself left

00:16:34.515 --> 00:16:37.431
in its wake,
after each visitation,

00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:41.559
thousands of people who were
maimed and crippled,

00:16:41.559 --> 00:16:45.058
as well as the dead.
 

00:16:45.058 --> 00:16:48.830
But the reality was a little
different.

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:54.147
Although epidemic modern
poliomyelitis increased the pace

00:16:54.147 --> 00:16:57.850
of its ravages in the Western
world,

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:03.294
proof soon emerged that polio
also imposed an unnoticed but

00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:08.365
equally heavy tribute of
suffering in the resource-poor

00:17:08.365 --> 00:17:10.150
tropical world.
 

00:17:10.150 --> 00:17:14.653
In other words,
this was an illusion that it

00:17:14.653 --> 00:17:19.890
was only afflicting the
industrial, clean world.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:23.150
This caused enormous surprise.
 

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:28.176
The prevailing dogma was that
poliomyelitis was an affliction

00:17:28.176 --> 00:17:32.952
of modernity and sanitation,
and was of negligible concern

00:17:32.952 --> 00:17:35.299
in the developing world.
 

00:17:35.299 --> 00:17:38.519
But World War II caused a shock.
 

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:43.670
Suddenly there was the
experience of non-immune U.S.,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:48.891
British, Australian troops,
stationed in places like Egypt

00:17:48.891 --> 00:17:52.513
or the Pacific,
and there, against all

00:17:52.513 --> 00:17:57.165
expectations,
significant numbers of them

00:17:57.165 --> 00:18:00.348
contracted poliomyelitis.
 

00:18:00.348 --> 00:18:04.903
And then this disturbing
finding was confirmed by

00:18:04.903 --> 00:18:08.890
evidence from serological
examinations,

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:14.689
from rectal swabs,
from laboratory analysis of the

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:19.660
microbial bounty in Third-World
sewers,

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:26.492
and by lameness surveys--that
is actually counting people who

00:18:26.492 --> 00:18:33.220
are afflicted by paralysis--
in places like India.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:37.867
And the evidence confirmed that
paralytic poliomyelitis in the

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:42.440
tropics was actually greater
than in the developed world,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.720
at its height,
but that it was unnoticed.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.470
Why was it not noticed?
 

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:52.936
It was not noticed,
in part, because physicians and

00:18:52.936 --> 00:18:58.210
public health officials had long
taught not to expect it;

00:18:58.210 --> 00:19:01.240
everyone closed their eyes.
 

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.112
It was also true because the
impoverished children of the

00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:09.259
tropical world had so little
access to medical care that they

00:19:09.259 --> 00:19:13.400
simply weren't seen;
they were invisible.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:18.442
Because the illnesses of the
poor were regarded as

00:19:18.442 --> 00:19:22.865
unremarkable,
and because the poor themselves

00:19:22.865 --> 00:19:28.145
fatalistically expected that
their children would suffer and

00:19:28.145 --> 00:19:31.278
die in disproportionate numbers.
 

00:19:31.278 --> 00:19:37.759
Meanwhile, maimed and paralyzed
children grew up in the Tropical

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:43.006
world to join the ranks of
beggars in the streets of

00:19:43.006 --> 00:19:45.990
Jakarta, Cairo and Lagos.
 

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:51.143
Well, the poliovirus was
discovered in 1908 by Karl

00:19:51.143 --> 00:19:55.202
Landsteiner--
who's on your handout--but

00:19:55.202 --> 00:20:01.096
thereafter the natural history
of the disease remains shrouded

00:20:01.096 --> 00:20:02.450
in mystery.
 

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.443
Still in 1950,
the mode of transmission and

00:20:06.443 --> 00:20:12.338
the portal of entry of the virus
into the body were unknown;

00:20:12.338 --> 00:20:17.749
as was the issue of whether
poliovirus existed in a single

00:20:17.749 --> 00:20:21.829
strain, or serotype,
or in multiple ones.

00:20:21.829 --> 00:20:24.788
Was there one type or many?
 

00:20:24.788 --> 00:20:29.212
Similarly, the immune
mechanisms of the body were not

00:20:29.212 --> 00:20:30.318
understood.
 

00:20:30.318 --> 00:20:34.786
And, in fact,
a critical mistake was made

00:20:34.786 --> 00:20:37.884
that--
and this mistake misled the

00:20:37.884 --> 00:20:42.932
public health community,
researchers and medical science

00:20:42.932 --> 00:20:47.365
for a long period,
from the 1920s or so,

00:20:47.365 --> 00:20:52.516
down to the 1950s--
and this was to assume that the

00:20:52.516 --> 00:20:57.791
course of the disease in human
beings was the same as that in

00:20:57.791 --> 00:20:58.759
monkeys.
 

00:20:58.759 --> 00:21:03.016
In other words,
there was an extrapolation from

00:21:03.016 --> 00:21:06.068
the laboratory to human beings.
 

00:21:06.068 --> 00:21:09.180
And this mistake had a number
of corollaries.

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:14.635
It meant that it was assumed
that the portal of entry of the

00:21:14.635 --> 00:21:18.704
virus was the nose,
rather than the digestive

00:21:18.704 --> 00:21:19.630
tract.
 

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:24.957
It was assumed that the disease
primarily attacked the central

00:21:24.957 --> 00:21:29.311
nervous system,
and that the virus made its way

00:21:29.311 --> 00:21:33.710
from the nose to the spinal cord
and the brain,

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:37.288
via the nervous system.
 

00:21:37.288 --> 00:21:41.584
Well in terms of public health,
and the possibility of vaccine

00:21:41.584 --> 00:21:45.848
development,
these conclusions were entirely

00:21:45.848 --> 00:21:52.118
counterproductive,
because they led to a corollary.

00:21:52.118 --> 00:21:55.868
The corollary was that since
the disease spread via the

00:21:55.868 --> 00:21:59.265
nervous system,
rather than the bloodstream,

00:21:59.265 --> 00:22:03.940
there was no opportunity for
antibodies to mount a defense,

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:10.078
and therefore no possibility
for developing a vaccine.

00:22:10.078 --> 00:22:16.087
Then we have an enormous
campaign of research and public

00:22:16.087 --> 00:22:23.078
health against this increasingly
feared and terrible disease,

00:22:23.078 --> 00:22:29.383
and this was with the National
Foundation of Infantile

00:22:29.383 --> 00:22:34.782
Paralysis,
and it spawned the March of

00:22:34.782 --> 00:22:39.545
Dimes Campaign,
which collected enormous

00:22:39.545 --> 00:22:43.338
amounts of money devoted to
research,

00:22:43.338 --> 00:22:47.616
and also to the care and
rehabilitation of the victims of

00:22:47.616 --> 00:22:48.838
poliomyelitis.
 

00:22:48.838 --> 00:22:53.480
Let me just show you some
images of the collecting of

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.390
funds in the middle decades of
the twentieth century.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.960
Or celebrities took part.
 

00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.446
This is Elvis Presley
campaigning for the March of

00:23:05.446 --> 00:23:06.180
Dimes.
 

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:11.730
Or you can see Elvis again
there.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:17.900
And most importantly,
one of the most famous,

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.170
probably the most famous of all
polio victims,

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:24.940
was President Franklin Delano
Roosevelt,

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:30.689
who was the leading figure in
the establishment of this

00:23:30.689 --> 00:23:34.463
foundation,
and the March of Dimes,

00:23:34.463 --> 00:23:39.827
and also another rehabilitation
center in Warm Springs,

00:23:39.827 --> 00:23:40.920
Georgia.
 

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:48.980
Let me just remind you that FDR
was in fact himself a victim of

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.490
polio, who was paralyzed.
 

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:58.752
In 1948, a major discovery was
made by three men who worked

00:23:58.752 --> 00:24:04.368
together as a team and shared
the Nobel Prize amongst

00:24:04.368 --> 00:24:05.990
themselves.
 

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.628
These were John Enders,
Thomas Weller and Frederick

00:24:10.628 --> 00:24:14.492
Robbins,
and they discovered that the

00:24:14.492 --> 00:24:20.384
poliovirus could be cultured
in vitro in non-nervous

00:24:20.384 --> 00:24:22.009
human tissue.
 

00:24:22.009 --> 00:24:25.009
Now, why was that discovery
critical?

00:24:25.009 --> 00:24:29.528
Well, first it meant that the
cost of research plummeted,

00:24:29.528 --> 00:24:35.157
because you didn't need to have
live monkeys to take care of in

00:24:35.157 --> 00:24:38.880
order to do experiments with the
virus.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:44.490
It led soon to the discovery
that the digestive tract,

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.930
rather than the nose,
was the portal of entry,

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:52.230
and it led to the discovery of
a phase in which antibodies

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.930
could attack the virus in the
open bloodstream.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:01.821
And it led to the discovery
that poliovirus exists in three

00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:05.173
different serotypes:
poliovirus 1,

00:25:05.173 --> 00:25:08.730
poliovirus 2,
and poliovirus 3.

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:13.178
And it was these discoveries
that made possible the

00:25:13.178 --> 00:25:16.558
successful development of a
vaccine.

00:25:16.558 --> 00:25:19.720
And this duly occurred in two
major forms.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.910
This was a momentous
development.

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:30.458
The first was by Jonas Salk,
and that was an inactivated

00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:36.411
injectable vaccine,
tested in 1904 and administered

00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:40.460
successfully en masse in 1955.
 

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:44.519
And Jonas Salk became a
national hero and celebrity for

00:25:44.519 --> 00:25:48.430
this, on the cover of
Time Magazine.

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:52.751
Everyone talked about him,
and indeed he was later to say

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:57.537
himself that he didn't need the
Nobel Prize because he was much

00:25:57.537 --> 00:26:00.470
more famous than the prize
itself.

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:05.509
Second was another vaccine,
a competitor if you like,

00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:09.288
which was a live oral polio
vaccine,

00:26:09.288 --> 00:26:14.710
developed by Albert Sabin,
and tested in 1959 and '60,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:19.630
and administered en masse in
the 1960s.

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:23.212
Now both of these developments
were funded by the National

00:26:23.212 --> 00:26:25.538
Foundation for Infantile
Paralysis.

00:26:25.538 --> 00:26:30.297
You can see the role of the
March of Dimes in leading to

00:26:30.297 --> 00:26:32.200
medical discoveries.
 

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:37.151
Almost immediately after the
development of these two

00:26:37.151 --> 00:26:42.007
vaccines, the goal of
eradication was taken up as an

00:26:42.007 --> 00:26:43.338
objective.
 

00:26:43.338 --> 00:26:46.952
In the 1950s,
already, Albert Sabin,

00:26:46.952 --> 00:26:51.287
for example,
made eradication an article of

00:26:51.287 --> 00:26:52.318
faith.
 

00:26:52.318 --> 00:26:56.152
He said the goal--and I'm
quoting--"is to completely

00:26:56.152 --> 00:26:59.046
eradicate poliomyelitis,
to eliminate it,

00:26:59.046 --> 00:27:02.413
to make it disappear,
to achieve ultimate

00:27:02.413 --> 00:27:04.278
eradication."
 

00:27:04.278 --> 00:27:09.180
Well, a major question was
which vaccine?

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:14.910
Should the campaign be based on
Salk's IPV;

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.710
that is, the injectable
inactivated vaccine?

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:23.500
Let me try to fix this in your
mind.

00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:29.414
This is a picture of Jonas
Salk, and as you can see he's

00:27:29.414 --> 00:27:35.222
holding--about to vaccinate
someone with his injectable

00:27:35.222 --> 00:27:37.589
inactivated virus.
 

00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:39.940
And here we can see him at work.
 

00:27:39.940 --> 00:27:46.140
This is how Jonas Salk's
vaccine operates with a syringe.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.509
It had a number of drawbacks.
 

00:27:49.509 --> 00:27:57.406
It was an effective public
health measure and led to a

00:27:57.406 --> 00:28:00.088
robust immunity.
 

00:28:00.088 --> 00:28:03.608
But it was administered by
injection,

00:28:03.608 --> 00:28:10.088
and in terms of being a
worldwide public health tool,

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:15.150
it required qualified
vaccinators, and that made it

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:21.019
too complicated and expensive
for a worldwide campaign,

00:28:21.019 --> 00:28:25.818
especially in Third World
countries.

00:28:25.818 --> 00:28:28.440
And since it was a killed
vaccine,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.711
killed by formaldehyde,
it would stimulate the

00:28:32.711 --> 00:28:38.494
production of antibodies,
but it wouldn't cause what was

00:28:38.494 --> 00:28:43.808
termed mucosal immunity directly
in the human gut.

00:28:43.808 --> 00:28:50.414
Then there was the alternative,
which was developed by Albert

00:28:50.414 --> 00:28:55.368
Sabin, which was the attenuated
live virus.

00:28:55.368 --> 00:29:00.049
This had--it was administered
initially on sugar cubes that

00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:04.568
were a couple of drops put on
them and then people downed

00:29:04.568 --> 00:29:06.990
them, especially children.
 

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:13.015
Or else it was a pink liquid
that was simply dropped with a

00:29:13.015 --> 00:29:15.818
dropper down your throat.
 

00:29:15.818 --> 00:29:20.118
And that could be administered
at a fraction of the cost--

00:29:20.118 --> 00:29:23.960
as I said, on sugar cubes or as
a liquid--

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.795
and the only skill that was
required of the vaccinator was

00:29:28.795 --> 00:29:33.817
the ability to count to two;
because you dropped two drops

00:29:33.817 --> 00:29:35.269
into the throat.
 

00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:40.932
And that's the--it took half an
hour to train a vaccinator using

00:29:40.932 --> 00:29:43.630
Albert Sabin's oral vaccine.
 

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:49.412
But equally importantly the
oral poliovirus caused a virus

00:29:49.412 --> 00:29:54.788
to be shed from the intestine
into the environment;

00:29:54.788 --> 00:29:59.811
that is, it took root and
flourished in the gut of the

00:29:59.811 --> 00:30:02.625
people,
of the vaccinees,

00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:06.690
and as they shed they would
spread,

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:10.480
that is the virus,
causing an asymptomatic and

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.028
harmless infection in the guts
of whole communities.

00:30:15.028 --> 00:30:18.020
Thereby you would raise the
herd immunity,

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:20.940
even in people who weren't
vaccinated.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:25.689
So, you could miss people with
Sabin's vaccine,

00:30:25.689 --> 00:30:29.509
and still reach entire
communities.

00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:33.144
That was the vaccine,
the major new tool,

00:30:33.144 --> 00:30:38.416
with its two different forms:
Salk's injectable vaccine and

00:30:38.416 --> 00:30:40.690
Sabin's oral vaccine.
 

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:45.825
But what the campaign relied
upon was something in addition

00:30:45.825 --> 00:30:50.961
to the new scientific tools,
and this was a new operational

00:30:50.961 --> 00:30:52.910
campaign strategy.
 

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:56.618
And the campaign strategy,
interestingly,

00:30:56.618 --> 00:31:01.460
was first devised in Fidel
Castro's Cuba,

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:06.075
and the campaign strategy
provided a context in which oral

00:31:06.075 --> 00:31:09.720
polio vaccine could be maximally
effective.

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:14.883
This was taken up and was
called the tool of National

00:31:14.883 --> 00:31:16.869
Immunization Days.
 

00:31:16.869 --> 00:31:19.368
Let's remember how they started.
 

00:31:19.368 --> 00:31:22.684
Instead of limiting
immunization to those who

00:31:22.684 --> 00:31:26.828
received routine vaccinations
from their physicians,

00:31:26.828 --> 00:31:33.275
the National Immunization Days
took as axiomatic that there was

00:31:33.275 --> 00:31:37.328
very limited access to medical
care,

00:31:37.328 --> 00:31:41.297
and so the idea was to not
bring patients to the

00:31:41.297 --> 00:31:45.348
vaccinators but to take vaccine
to the people.

00:31:45.348 --> 00:31:50.109
In 1962 in Cuba,
the grassroots organizations of

00:31:50.109 --> 00:31:54.093
Castro's revolution,
which were called Committees

00:31:54.093 --> 00:31:56.220
for the Defense of the
Revolution,

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:01.337
carried out house-to-house
surveys to locate every child on

00:32:01.337 --> 00:32:05.833
the island of Cuba,
and then vaccinators made a

00:32:05.833 --> 00:32:11.318
return visit to vaccinate every
child who'd been located.

00:32:11.318 --> 00:32:18.079
This procedure morphed in the
United States into what were

00:32:18.079 --> 00:32:23.536
called Sabin Oral Sundays,
beginning at Tucson,

00:32:23.536 --> 00:32:24.960
Arizona.
 

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:28.520
And, as you can imagine,
these Sabin Oral Sundays

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.452
weren't sponsored by Committees
for the Defense of the

00:32:32.452 --> 00:32:37.135
Revolution,
but rather by local and county

00:32:37.135 --> 00:32:41.890
chapters of the AMA,
and its members volunteered

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:45.063
their services,
alongside those of local

00:32:45.063 --> 00:32:47.670
pharmacists,
county health officials,

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:51.971
nurses, school teachers,
clergymen, the local press,

00:32:51.971 --> 00:32:53.519
and housewives.
 

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:57.202
And the vaccine was
administered in school

00:32:57.202 --> 00:32:58.279
buildings.
 

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:01.781
This campaign,
thus structured with the new

00:33:01.781 --> 00:33:06.201
tool of vaccine and the new
organizational strategy of

00:33:06.201 --> 00:33:11.369
National Immunization Days,
successful eradicated smallpox,

00:33:11.369 --> 00:33:16.670
first in the United States,
and then in the Americas.

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:23.506
In 1988, the World Health
Organization then launched the

00:33:23.506 --> 00:33:28.230
Global Polio Eradication
Initiative.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.732
At the outset,
it was supported in particular

00:33:31.732 --> 00:33:36.192
by what was the equivalent of
the Gates Foundation of its

00:33:36.192 --> 00:33:39.796
time,
and that is the resources and

00:33:39.796 --> 00:33:45.795
international structure of the
32,000 clubs worldwide of Rotary

00:33:45.795 --> 00:33:48.930
International;
which was an NGO,

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:53.665
as I said, somewhat equivalent
in its time to the Gates

00:33:53.665 --> 00:33:56.210
Foundation of our own day.
 

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:01.220
The campaign also enjoyed the
support of the CDC,

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:04.848
of international agencies like
the G8--

00:34:04.848 --> 00:34:07.430
as it was then,
it's no longer that,

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:12.023
it's expanded--the African
Union, various national

00:34:12.023 --> 00:34:16.510
governments,
and an army of vaccinators.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.869
From the beginning,
the Global Polio Eradication

00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:26.621
Initiative adopted the strategy
of combining Sabin's oral polio

00:34:26.621 --> 00:34:31.722
vaccine with Cuba's operational
device of community-wide

00:34:31.722 --> 00:34:33.949
immunization days.
 

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:38.581
The goal was to provide the
most susceptible populations on

00:34:38.581 --> 00:34:40.615
earth,
small children,

00:34:40.615 --> 00:34:44.039
worldwide, every child on the
planet,

00:34:44.039 --> 00:34:51.360
to be vaccinated with at least
two doses of oral polio vaccine.

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.199
Now, let's remember what a
gargantuan effort this actually

00:34:56.199 --> 00:34:56.710
was.
 

00:34:56.710 --> 00:35:01.452
National Immunization Days were
extraordinary events that

00:35:01.452 --> 00:35:06.449
necessitated the participation
of 10 million people in their

00:35:06.449 --> 00:35:07.889
organization.
 

00:35:07.889 --> 00:35:13.364
Take the example of India,
where the National Immunization

00:35:13.364 --> 00:35:19.610
Days became the largest single
public health events in history;

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:26.063
when as many as 93 million
children were vaccinated on

00:35:26.063 --> 00:35:27.768
single days.
 

00:35:27.768 --> 00:35:35.820
Well, 1988 to 2003,
the campaign made huge

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:37.980
progress.
 

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.699
In 1988, the World Health
Organization estimated that

00:35:42.699 --> 00:35:49.027
there were 350,000 cases,
worldwide, of paralysis from

00:35:49.027 --> 00:35:53.322
polio,
and it believed the disease to

00:35:53.322 --> 00:35:56.429
be endemic in 125 countries.
 

00:35:56.429 --> 00:36:00.045
In 1988 itself,
transmission was halted in

00:36:00.045 --> 00:36:00.840
Europe.
 

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:04.599
In 1991, it was halted in the
Americas,

00:36:04.599 --> 00:36:11.911
in 1997, in the Pacific region,
and in 2001 there was a world

00:36:11.911 --> 00:36:18.494
record with a low of 483
recorded cases of paralysis in

00:36:18.494 --> 00:36:23.369
just four endemic countries:
India,

00:36:23.369 --> 00:36:28.500
Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Nigeria.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:33.489
Let me show you a map.
 

00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:36.273
This is 2008,
as you can see,

00:36:36.273 --> 00:36:41.445
and the countries in red are
those where polio is now

00:36:41.445 --> 00:36:44.550
endemic,
and the ones in yellow are

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:51.192
places that it spread to,
from those endemic countries,

00:36:51.192 --> 00:36:52.670
in 2008.
 

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:58.994
Well, there was a setback in
2003, and what did that

00:36:58.994 --> 00:37:00.360
indicate?
 

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.389
Already vanquished in the
industrial world,

00:37:03.389 --> 00:37:08.911
poliomyelitis,
in 2003, remained endemic only

00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:16.039
in some of the most unsanitary,
poverty stricken and insecure

00:37:16.039 --> 00:37:18.210
places on the planet.
 

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:22.206
This is one reason that it's a
mockery to think of

00:37:22.206 --> 00:37:27.018
poliomyelitis as a disease of
the affluent and the clean.

00:37:27.018 --> 00:37:34.389
Poliomyelitis had been driven
back to the war-torn and remote

00:37:34.389 --> 00:37:39.157
areas of Pakistan,
to Muslim dominated states of

00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:43.259
northern Nigeria,
northern Sindh in Pakistan,

00:37:43.259 --> 00:37:48.400
and the states of Bihar and
Uttar Pradesh in India.

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:53.561
Now, the Muslim states of
Nigeria, and especially Kano,

00:37:53.561 --> 00:37:58.724
as we'll talk about in a
moment, were the most striking

00:37:58.724 --> 00:37:59.679
cases.
 

00:37:59.679 --> 00:38:04.132
There, in northern Nigeria,
the campaign was actually

00:38:04.132 --> 00:38:07.643
halted by a boycott,
an organized boycott,

00:38:07.643 --> 00:38:09.699
for thirteen months.
 

00:38:09.699 --> 00:38:13.623
As a result,
in Nigeria, the disease flared

00:38:13.623 --> 00:38:18.389
up, causing hundreds of cases of
acute paralysis.

00:38:18.389 --> 00:38:21.989
And alarmingly it spread from
Nigeria widely,

00:38:21.989 --> 00:38:26.717
causing outbreaks of paralysis
in eighteen countries in West

00:38:26.717 --> 00:38:30.911
and Central Africa,
that had previously had been

00:38:30.911 --> 00:38:32.909
pronounced polio free.
 

00:38:32.909 --> 00:38:38.670
Well, what were the problems
that emerged in 2003?

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:45.402
I'm going to say that they were
operational, religious,

00:38:45.402 --> 00:38:48.768
political and biological.
 

00:38:48.768 --> 00:38:54.679
Operationally you can see the
problems that would emerge in a

00:38:54.679 --> 00:38:58.954
place like Afghanistan,
and why that would be a

00:38:58.954 --> 00:39:03.351
recalcitrant place for public
health officials to attempt to

00:39:03.351 --> 00:39:06.780
eradicate a disease as
entrenched as polio.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:13.958
War and lack of security made
vaccination campaigns dangerous

00:39:13.958 --> 00:39:17.190
and sometimes impossible.
 

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:21.199
But let's look for a moment at
a different place.

00:39:21.199 --> 00:39:25.893
And this is a map of Nigeria,
if you imagine the country,

00:39:25.893 --> 00:39:31.088
and that's the state I want to
talk about, the state of Kano in

00:39:31.088 --> 00:39:32.849
northern Nigeria.
 

00:39:32.849 --> 00:39:41.070
There we see a problem that's
political and religious.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:46.876
Muslim leaders in Kano--and
that's in a country--the

00:39:46.876 --> 00:39:52.230
government of Nigeria is
Christian-dominated.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.800
The states of northern Nigeria,
however,

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:01.762
are Muslim, and they were
suspicious in northern Nigeria

00:40:01.762 --> 00:40:07.465
about Western intentions,
especially after the launching

00:40:07.465 --> 00:40:12.932
of war in Afghanistan and Iraq,
and people began to preach,

00:40:12.932 --> 00:40:17.518
religious leaders,
that oral polio vaccine,

00:40:17.518 --> 00:40:23.159
these drops were not a measure
of public health,

00:40:23.159 --> 00:40:28.715
but instead a sinister plot to
sterilize Muslim children by

00:40:28.715 --> 00:40:33.572
poisoning them,
so that Islam would recede from

00:40:33.572 --> 00:40:38.119
the earth and Christianity could
replace it.

00:40:38.119 --> 00:40:44.954
And this whole thinking was
ramped up by the issue raised by

00:40:44.954 --> 00:40:51.695
the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,
which had conducted unethical

00:40:51.695 --> 00:40:55.844
testing in Nigeria,
in a way that inflamed public

00:40:55.844 --> 00:40:59.757
opinion especially,
and led to a major lawsuit

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:01.630
against the company.
 

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.318
Furthermore,
since the traditional dogma

00:41:04.318 --> 00:41:08.385
about poliomyelitis held that it
was an insignificant public

00:41:08.385 --> 00:41:11.280
health problem in the tropical
world,

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:17.000
it was difficult for many to
understand why the international

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.719
community was so intent on
trying to rid Nigeria of polio.

00:41:22.719 --> 00:41:26.717
The Nigerians themselves
regarded other disease as much

00:41:26.717 --> 00:41:29.679
greater causes of death and
suffering.

00:41:29.679 --> 00:41:34.507
Why was the international
community not concentrated on

00:41:34.507 --> 00:41:38.980
dealing with malaria,
tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS?

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:44.750
Why all this attention to
polio, that seemed to them a

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.690
relatively minor problem?
 

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:54.179
The Emir of Kano was unable to
discern benign intentions also

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:58.289
when it transpired that
industrial,

00:41:58.289 --> 00:42:03.128
predominantly Christian
nations, were vaccinating their

00:42:03.128 --> 00:42:07.340
own populations instead with
Salk's vaccine--

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:12.556
that is, the IPV--while
insisting that Nigerians receive

00:42:12.556 --> 00:42:14.360
the oral vaccine.
 

00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.510
Why on earth was that?
 

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:21.349
Finally, opposition to the
vaccination campaign,

00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:24.389
promoted by the
Christian-dominated federal

00:42:24.389 --> 00:42:28.025
government of Nigeria,
served as a proxy for

00:42:28.025 --> 00:42:32.545
sectional, political and
religious discontents in the

00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:34.980
minority northern states.
 

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:39.710
So, the result was a boycott of
the anti-polio campaign,

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:45.253
and it lasted until 2004,
at which time Muslim operated

00:42:45.253 --> 00:42:52.030
laboratories in Indonesia agreed
to supply vaccines to Nigeria,

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:56.963
and other Muslim operated
laboratories in India analyzed

00:42:56.963 --> 00:43:00.820
the vaccine previously supplied
to Kano,

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:05.394
and found it to be harmless,
at which point prominent Muslim

00:43:05.394 --> 00:43:10.358
leaders around the world pressed
their co-religionists in Nigeria

00:43:10.358 --> 00:43:13.460
to support the international
effort.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:18.550
But by then considerable harm
had been done to the campaign.

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:22.867
It was not clear either that
large numbers of Muslim parents

00:43:22.867 --> 00:43:27.039
would ever again allow their
children to be immunized,

00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:31.760
or that the spread of the virus
beyond Nigerian borders was

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:34.610
something that could be
reversed.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:38.532
Let's say that deals then with
political and religious

00:43:38.532 --> 00:43:39.420
obstacles.
 

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:43.550
Then there were biological ones.
 

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:47.099
And to illustrate those,
let me go somewhere else.

00:43:47.099 --> 00:43:54.195
And this is Uttar Pradesh,
in a Muslim-dominated state in

00:43:54.195 --> 00:43:55.210
India.
 

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:59.460
And again you see there the
issue of Muslim suspicions and

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.550
resistance to vaccination.
 

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:06.155
But I want to turn from
those--imagine all of that going

00:44:06.155 --> 00:44:11.349
on--but I'd like to look at some
biological issues that emerged

00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:13.360
in places like this.
 

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:18.400
The first was whether polio
turned out to be more

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:21.340
complicated than smallpox.
 

00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.469
Because smallpox had only one
serotype;

00:44:24.469 --> 00:44:28.663
poliovirus has types 1,2 and 3,
and there's no crossover

00:44:28.663 --> 00:44:31.179
immunity from one to the other.
 

00:44:31.179 --> 00:44:34.619
So, it was a more complicated
disease than smallpox.

00:44:34.619 --> 00:44:36.710
That was a first problem.
 

00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:40.789
And this emerged in the form of
what kind of vaccine do you use;

00:44:40.789 --> 00:44:45.065
one that's monovalent,
attacking developing resistance

00:44:45.065 --> 00:44:49.340
against only one type of
poliovirus, or polyvalent?

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:54.306
Should it be try to immunize
you at once against one,

00:44:54.306 --> 00:44:56.789
two, or all three types?
 

00:44:56.789 --> 00:45:01.436
It turned out that polyvalent
vaccines, for complicated

00:45:01.436 --> 00:45:04.190
reasons, weren't so effective.
 

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:09.280
Another was a problem of
monitoring and surveillance.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:14.313
Unlike smallpox,
the vast majority of polio

00:45:14.313 --> 00:45:17.429
cases were asymptomatic.
 

00:45:17.429 --> 00:45:22.449
And then there was a problem
called "interference".

00:45:22.449 --> 00:45:26.697
Children were found to be
vaccinated twenty and

00:45:26.697 --> 00:45:31.221
twenty-five times,
and still not to have developed

00:45:31.221 --> 00:45:33.530
an immunity to polio.
 

00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:34.639
Why was that?
 

00:45:34.639 --> 00:45:38.690
It turned out that in
unsanitary tropical conditions,

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:42.489
the intestinal flora of other
viruses,

00:45:42.489 --> 00:45:47.920
particularly enteroviruses,
in the digestive tract,

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:54.804
could be so dense that the
poliovirus in the vaccine would

00:45:54.804 --> 00:46:00.963
be unable to establish an
infection and therefore an

00:46:00.963 --> 00:46:03.380
immune response.
 

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:08.324
There were other problems that
emerged in these turbulent

00:46:08.324 --> 00:46:13.625
years, after 2003--turbulent for
the Global Polio Eradication

00:46:13.625 --> 00:46:14.949
Initiative.
 

00:46:14.949 --> 00:46:20.688
One was that live viruses,
the Sabin poliovirus--remember,

00:46:20.688 --> 00:46:26.530
it's a live vaccine--it was
unlike the smallpox vaccine.

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.751
The smallpox vaccine,
as you know,

00:46:29.751 --> 00:46:35.119
was a vaccine from cowpox,
that had a crossover immunity

00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:40.880
to smallpox, and cowpox is not a
serious human disease.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:45.934
With polio instead,
what's administered through the

00:46:45.934 --> 00:46:50.815
oral vaccine is a live virus;
in attenuated strains,

00:46:50.815 --> 00:46:53.829
yes, but it still is the live
virus,

00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:58.835
and therefore there is always
the possibility of the virus

00:46:58.835 --> 00:47:02.699
mutating and reverting to a
virulent form.

00:47:02.699 --> 00:47:07.721
And this indeed happened,
causing outbreaks of what's

00:47:07.721 --> 00:47:11.969
called vaccine-associated
paralytic polio.

00:47:11.969 --> 00:47:15.210
This possibility wasn't just
theoretical.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:19.628
It happened in the Philippines,
in Madagascar,

00:47:19.628 --> 00:47:22.380
in China and in Indonesia.
 

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:27.260
Reversing progress against the
disease, outbreaks of that kind

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.860
occasioned a quip.
 

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:33.813
The quip was that it was
impossible to eradicate polio

00:47:33.813 --> 00:47:36.900
without the oral polio vaccine.
 

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:42.831
But it was also impossible to
eradicate polio with it because

00:47:42.831 --> 00:47:47.480
the vaccine itself led to
outbreaks of polio.

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.619
So, vaccine-associated
poliovirus implied something

00:47:51.619 --> 00:47:55.016
serious,
that the campaign against

00:47:55.016 --> 00:47:59.690
poliomyelitis could have no
logical endpoint,

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:03.393
because it would always be
necessary to immunize

00:48:03.393 --> 00:48:08.041
populations against epidemics
that could be initiated by the

00:48:08.041 --> 00:48:09.539
vaccine itself.
 

00:48:09.539 --> 00:48:12.570
A very paradoxical situation.
 

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:16.898
And the difficulty is all the
more intractable because people

00:48:16.898 --> 00:48:21.300
with immunodeficiency disorders
can continue to shed the virus

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.969
for as long as ten years or
more.

00:48:23.969 --> 00:48:27.309
If the campaign were ever
allowed to lapse,

00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:31.579
the accumulation of
non-immunized susceptibles could

00:48:31.579 --> 00:48:36.434
result in devastating virgin
soil epidemics among those who

00:48:36.434 --> 00:48:38.110
had no immunity.
 

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:41.804
So, for this reason critics
have argued that the WHO

00:48:41.804 --> 00:48:45.210
campaign involved a semantic
trick with the word

00:48:45.210 --> 00:48:47.239
"eradication."
 

00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:50.579
Traditionally,
eradication had always implied

00:48:50.579 --> 00:48:54.679
the cessation of the need to
maintain public protective

00:48:54.679 --> 00:48:56.730
public health policies.
 

00:48:56.730 --> 00:49:00.836
But vaccine-associated polio,
paralytic polio,

00:49:00.836 --> 00:49:06.221
meant that planners for this
campaign would have to continue

00:49:06.221 --> 00:49:08.960
immunization indefinitely.
 

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.396
The traditional criterion that
eradication implied the end of

00:49:13.396 --> 00:49:16.650
prophylactic measures was
quietly dropped.

00:49:16.650 --> 00:49:20.047
And then there are the problems
about certification and

00:49:20.047 --> 00:49:20.929
eradication.
 

00:49:20.929 --> 00:49:25.355
Poliovirus is notorious for
being silent and undetected in

00:49:25.355 --> 00:49:28.382
its circulation,
at the other end of the

00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:30.480
spectrum from smallpox.
 

00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:35.327
So, how would you be able to
actually confirm that there were

00:49:35.327 --> 00:49:36.619
no more cases?
 

00:49:36.619 --> 00:49:42.108
And it's also true that another
problem, that symptoms of

00:49:42.108 --> 00:49:47.599
paralytic- acute flaccid
paralysis can be caused by other

00:49:47.599 --> 00:49:49.070
conditions.
 

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:50.380
They're on your handout.
 

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:54.219
I won't mention them because
I'm rapidly running out of time.

00:49:54.219 --> 00:49:59.007
But in my last thirty seconds I
would say that the history of

00:49:59.007 --> 00:50:03.476
Global Polio Eradication
Initiative demonstrates that the

00:50:03.476 --> 00:50:08.313
original optimistic belief,
that polio, like smallpox,

00:50:08.313 --> 00:50:12.090
can be readily eradicated by
vaccination,

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:13.969
was misplaced.
 

00:50:13.969 --> 00:50:18.440
Smallpox is exceptionally
vulnerable to attack.

00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:22.976
It has no animal reservoirs,
no range of serotypes that

00:50:22.976 --> 00:50:25.579
confer no crossover immunity.
 

00:50:25.579 --> 00:50:30.384
Its symptoms were almost always
memorable and florid for the

00:50:30.384 --> 00:50:31.280
sufferer.
 

00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.003
It gives rise in survivors to a
lasting immunity,

00:50:35.003 --> 00:50:39.655
and the vaccine used to attack
it is effective after a single

00:50:39.655 --> 00:50:40.510
effort.
 

00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:45.904
Polio is a far more formidable
enemy that reminds us that the

00:50:45.904 --> 00:50:50.760
original eradicationist
perspective may be illusory.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:55.485
The human condition is to be
surrounded by near infinity of

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:58.989
infectious, constantly evolving
microbes.

00:50:58.989 --> 00:51:03.269
Occasional final victories are
possible, but they should be

00:51:03.269 --> 00:51:06.811
celebrated as exceptions,
rather than regarded as

00:51:06.811 --> 00:51:10.059
successive steps to a
disease-free Eden.

00:51:10.059 --> 00:51:14.893
The normal state is one of
vigilance, to minimize harm and

00:51:14.893 --> 00:51:16.420
achieve control.
 

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:22.036
Polio seems to me unlikely soon
to follow smallpox by becoming

00:51:22.036 --> 00:51:27.010
the second infectious disease
ever to be eradicated.

00:51:27.010 --> 00:51:30.670
That would be--if I had time,
I'd talk more about it.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:31.449
But I don't.
 

00:51:31.449 --> 00:51:32.869
So, let's stop there.
 

00:51:32.869 --> 00:51:36.804
And I don't want to make a
prediction, but I think we need

00:51:36.804 --> 00:51:39.909
to see how complex eradication
actually is.

00:51:39.909 --> 00:51:44.949
And polio isn't like smallpox;
and many other diseases aren't.

00:51:44.949 --> 00:51:50.000

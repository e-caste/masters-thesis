Prof: Okay,
this morning we're going to

00:00:04.654 --> 00:00:07.948
carry on talking about Jeremy
Bentham and classical

00:00:07.948 --> 00:00:09.200
utilitarianism.
 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.019
And I'm going to begin by
making a few points about the

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.736
measurement of utility,
which we bumped into in a

00:00:18.736 --> 00:00:23.747
glancing kind of way last time,
but we're going to dig into it

00:00:23.747 --> 00:00:24.610
a little bit.
 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.539
And then we're going to move
from that into talking about

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.380
utility and distribution in
classical utilitarianism;

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.697
how we should think about the
measurement of utility across

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:42.940
the whole society and what
implications Bentham's argument

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.764
has for that,
and I think you'll start to see

00:00:46.764 --> 00:00:51.251
why classical utilitarianism
became such an ideologically

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:55.178
powerful doctrine in the
eighteenth and nineteenth

00:00:55.178 --> 00:00:56.380
centuries.
 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.182
So just briefly to recap,
we talked last time about

00:01:01.182 --> 00:01:04.930
Bentham's principle being
maximized,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.310
"the greatest happiness of
the greatest number."

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.629
The idea being that if you
think of,

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:12.188
in this case,
a very simple two-person

00:01:12.188 --> 00:01:15.729
society,
and you think of that as the

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.979
status quo,
A has that much utility,

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.019
B has that much utility.
 

00:01:21.019 --> 00:01:25.638
Anything on this side of the
status quo would be an

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:28.040
improvement for society.
 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.768
The greatest happiness of the
greatest number will have been

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:33.730
increased.
 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.507
Now, that's all very abstract,
and by way of trying to make it

00:01:39.507 --> 00:01:44.337
somewhat more concrete,
let's notice two features of

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:46.610
utility measurement.
 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.409
The first, as I said to you
last time, as far as Bentham is

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.870
concerned, this is a doctrine of
what I called objective egoism;

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.349
that people are self-interested
and behave self-interestedly,

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:05.716
but that we can figure out
what's likely to motive them

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:10.085
regardless of their own
interpretation of their actions

00:02:10.085 --> 00:02:11.379
or behavior.
 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.230
We have our interpretation;
remember, Bentham says the rare

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.086
case--
as with the physiology of the

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:20.425
human body,
so with the anatomy and

00:02:20.425 --> 00:02:25.397
physiology of the human mind,
it's the rare case that you get

00:02:25.397 --> 00:02:28.008
it right about yourself.
 

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:32.301
And it's the objective
scientific calculus that's going

00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:35.878
to tell us what maximizes
people's utility.

00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:38.940
Now, you might say,
"Well, how is that

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.199
actually going to work?"
 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:45.479
So there are two steps here.
 

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:49.639
The first one is that he thinks
all utility is quantifiable.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.091
I went through that last time,
but the piece I didn't mention

00:02:54.091 --> 00:02:58.394
is that it follows from that
that utility is reducible to a

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:02.300
single index,
and in this case Bentham's

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.180
thinking of money.
 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.216
Money is going to be the
measure of utility in his

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:11.419
scheme,
and that means that we could

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:16.264
think of these units of utility
as having a kind of dollar

00:03:16.264 --> 00:03:17.030
value.
 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.674
So anytime you think this
doctrine is crude or extreme,

00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:27.006
remember my point that this is
a guy who takes every thought to

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:29.068
the logical extreme.
 

00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:34.339
But if so you get one,
let's just for simplicity say,

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:39.710
say one Standard International
Util costs a dollar.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.383
And let's suppose you
experience two Standard

00:03:44.383 --> 00:03:49.800
International Utils of pain from
coming to class.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.841
Then I could make you
indifferent between coming to

00:03:53.841 --> 00:03:58.530
class and not coming to class by
paying you two dollars.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.126
It could get you to come to
class if I paid three dollars,

00:04:02.126 --> 00:04:05.848
and I would not get you to come
to class if I paid a dollar,

00:04:05.848 --> 00:04:06.479
right?
 

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.158
And so that's the second point.
 

00:04:08.158 --> 00:04:13.991
In the first instance we say
that utility is quantifiable and

00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:18.536
expressible through money,
but then related to that,

00:04:18.536 --> 00:04:21.990
and as indicated in the example
I just gave you,

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.990
we can work with a doctrine of
revealed preference.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.910
We can vary the price that we
charge admission for the course.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.348
So let's say we charge--let's
imagine there are three of you

00:04:35.348 --> 00:04:40.694
and one of you experiences two
utils of pain from coming to

00:04:40.694 --> 00:04:44.279
class,
one experiences three utils of

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:47.745
pain,
and one experiences two utils

00:04:47.745 --> 00:04:49.029
of pleasure.
 

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:52.704
There's one perverse student in
the audience who actually likes

00:04:52.704 --> 00:04:54.009
coming to the class.
 

00:04:54.009 --> 00:04:58.786
So then we would find that if
we paid a dollar,

00:04:58.786 --> 00:05:01.278
one of you would come.
 

00:05:01.278 --> 00:05:06.288
If we increase it to two-fifty,
two of you would come,

00:05:06.288 --> 00:05:11.865
and so we could vary the price
to get information about your

00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:13.000
utility.
 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.994
And we could even influence
your behavior without actually

00:05:15.994 --> 00:05:18.778
changing your preferences,
and that's a very important

00:05:18.778 --> 00:05:20.040
distinction to make.
 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.105
Your enjoyment from coming or
not coming to class wouldn't

00:05:27.105 --> 00:05:35.040
change, but your behavior would
change if we varied the price;

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.666
so that we can influence your
behavior by manipulating the

00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:44.538
incentives without regard to
what your underlying preferences

00:05:44.538 --> 00:05:47.449
are,
and we could allow them

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.009
actually to stay the same.
 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:56.038
You'd rather be at home asleep,
but if the price is high enough

00:05:56.038 --> 00:05:58.079
you'll come anyway.
 

00:05:58.079 --> 00:06:03.630
Okay, so that's all well and
good at the level of thinking

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:10.408
about one individual's behavior,
but what about thinking about

00:06:10.408 --> 00:06:14.009
society in more general terms?
 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.721
When we talk about
utilitarianism in Bentham's

00:06:18.721 --> 00:06:22.050
system,
classical utilitarianism,

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.163
we see that he operates with
these numbers that attach to

00:06:27.163 --> 00:06:32.639
specific actions or policies and
that we can make comparisons

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.829
across individuals.
 

00:06:34.829 --> 00:06:39.841
So to put this in the jargon of
economists, Bentham allows

00:06:39.841 --> 00:06:43.269
interpersonal comparisons of
utility.

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:47.209
Bentham allows interpersonal
comparisons of utility.

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:52.976
We can say that if you take one
unit of utility from one person

00:06:52.976 --> 00:06:58.649
and give it to another person
their utility will go up and the

00:06:58.649 --> 00:07:03.019
first person's utility is going
to go down.

00:07:03.019 --> 00:07:10.625
Okay, so it's a doctrine of
interpersonal comparisons of

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:12.009
utility.
 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.478
And for those of you who are
mathematicians here it might

00:07:14.478 --> 00:07:16.903
also be worth noting that
Bentham operates with cardinal

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:17.389
scales.
 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:18.990
These are additive things.
 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:23.910
You can actually think about
these as sort of lumps of

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.666
pleasure or pain experience that
are moved around across people

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:33.009
and can be added and subtracted.
 

00:07:33.009 --> 00:07:36.401
And so I put up just here to
sort of--so you can think your

00:07:36.401 --> 00:07:38.040
way through this doctrine.
 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.615
If you imagine a status quo,
a perfectly egalitarian world

00:07:42.615 --> 00:07:46.550
in which each person has six
units of utility,

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.930
you can start asking yourself,
"Well,

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.000
let's imagine if we could
redistribute things."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.870
What would that mean as far as
Bentham's doctrine is concerned?

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.721
What I've given in this first
column as a potential departure

00:08:01.721 --> 00:08:05.925
from the status quo is the
utility monster example we

00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:08.110
talked about last time.
 

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:13.276
If it turns out Leonid has a
vastly superior capacity to

00:08:13.276 --> 00:08:17.129
experience pleasure than anybody
else,

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:24.790
then we could get a huge
increase in total utility by

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:32.600
taking a lot from B and C and
giving it to Leonid,

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.912
so that we would say
"allow,"

00:08:36.912 --> 00:08:37.820
right?
 

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.879
Or we could think of this
change from the status quo--

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:48.029
we go to a more inegalitarian
society and,

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:50.024
again, the greatest happiness
of the greatest number has

00:08:50.024 --> 00:08:50.460
increased.
 

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:54.413
We have a world here where
there are eighteen utils and a

00:08:54.413 --> 00:08:57.519
world here where there are
nineteen utils.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:01.649
Or think about this case,
we might think of this as a

00:09:01.649 --> 00:09:05.538
kind of schematization of the
Eichmann problem.

00:09:05.538 --> 00:09:12.062
If the utility that the Aryans
gain from practicing genocide

00:09:12.062 --> 00:09:18.918
and ethnic cleansing against the
Jews exceed the utilities that

00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:23.799
the Jews lose,
there would be no reason under

00:09:23.799 --> 00:09:26.860
Bentham's doctrine not to do it.
 

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:34.009
Okay, now there's a certain
ambiguity in the phrase,

00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:37.020
"Maximize the greatest
happiness of the greatest

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.336
number,"
which Bentham never finally

00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:40.090
resolves.
 

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.850
The ambiguity is whether he's
saying just maximize the total,

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:46.350
so here the total's bigger than
eighteen,

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:48.370
here the total's bigger than
eighteen,

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.418
here the total's bigger than
eighteen,

00:09:50.418 --> 00:09:53.850
so it's obviously the case that
it's preferable,

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:56.879
on Bentham's scheme,
to the status quo.

00:09:56.879 --> 00:10:02.177
Or is he perhaps saying
maximize the utility of the

00:10:02.177 --> 00:10:05.307
majority,
the greatest happiness of the

00:10:05.307 --> 00:10:08.105
greatest number,
the greatest number simply

00:10:08.105 --> 00:10:09.500
meaning the majority?
 

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.753
But in that second
interpretation you could still

00:10:13.753 --> 00:10:18.183
get highly inegalitarian
distributions being judged

00:10:18.183 --> 00:10:22.807
superior to the status quo,
because if you imagine going

00:10:22.807 --> 00:10:26.317
from here to here we've got a
majority here experiencing

00:10:26.317 --> 00:10:32.433
twelve utils of pleasure,
and here we have a majority of

00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:40.678
two experiencing seventeen
potentially utils of pleasure.

00:10:40.678 --> 00:10:45.595
So there is some ambiguity
there as to just what Bentham

00:10:45.595 --> 00:10:48.697
meant,
but most of the time he is

00:10:48.697 --> 00:10:53.029
taken as having meant just the
crude statement,

00:10:53.029 --> 00:10:58.009
"Maximize the total amount
of utility in the society."

00:10:58.009 --> 00:11:01.615
And so that nuance between
whether we're saying the

00:11:01.615 --> 00:11:06.160
greatest number means a majority
or just the total amount is not

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.480
something that will detain us
any further.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:16.032
Now, you could say,
"Okay, so far so good,

00:11:16.032 --> 00:11:24.009
but isn't all of this a little
counterintuitive?"

00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:29.188
After all, if you
compare--let's focus on the

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:36.370
difference between the status
quo and distribution IV here.

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.899
These people might be on the
verge of starvation.

00:11:40.899 --> 00:11:48.085
Surely giving them a unit of
utility is going to be much more

00:11:48.085 --> 00:11:55.629
enhancing to their happiness
than giving A a unit of utility.

00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:58.789
Anyone know what the principle
behind that idea is?

00:11:58.789 --> 00:12:02.960
 
 

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:05.629
Anyone want to take it?
 

00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:12.058
How many of you have done ECON
101, the first econ course?

00:12:12.058 --> 00:12:20.931
Yeah, so what is the principle
that would tell you if you have

00:12:20.931 --> 00:12:27.038
no food and I give you a loaf of
bread,

00:12:27.038 --> 00:12:30.032
your utility goes up a lot more
than if I have ten loaves of

00:12:30.032 --> 00:12:32.009
bread and I give you a loaf of
bread.

00:12:32.009 --> 00:12:33.169
Somebody?
 

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:37.870
Okay.
 

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.350
Student:  Diminishing
marginal utility.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:41.825
Prof: Diminishing
marginal utility,

00:12:41.825 --> 00:12:45.205
the principle of diminishing
marginal utility of all good

00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:45.870
things.
 

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:53.009
And this is the idea just
encapsulated,

00:12:53.009 --> 00:12:57.431
to make it a little bit more
dramatic: if you don't have a

00:12:57.431 --> 00:13:01.000
car and somebody gives you a
Porsche Turbo,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.980
your utility's going to go up a
huge amount,

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.940
right?
 

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.677
But if you already have a
Porsche Turbo and somebody gives

00:13:07.677 --> 00:13:10.957
you a second one,
you're going to get less new

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:16.009
utility from the second Porsche
than you had from the first.

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:18.975
And if somebody gives you a
third one you're going to have

00:13:18.975 --> 00:13:21.264
less utility,
less new utility from the third

00:13:21.264 --> 00:13:23.190
one that you had from the
second.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.870
It's not that you won't get any
new, but you'll get less.

00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:29.173
And the principle of
diminishing marginal utility

00:13:29.173 --> 00:13:32.547
says that this line will get
flatter, and flatter,

00:13:32.547 --> 00:13:34.750
and flatter toward infinity.
 

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:41.942
You'll always get more utility
from a new increment of the same

00:13:41.942 --> 00:13:45.586
good,
but it'll be less new utility

00:13:45.586 --> 00:13:51.019
than you got from the previous
increment of that same good,

00:13:51.019 --> 00:13:51.769
okay?
 

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:55.389
That's the concept of
diminishing marginal utility.

00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:59.139
The new utility you get
diminishes at the margin.

00:13:59.139 --> 00:14:03.150
Each new Porsche is less
valuable to you than the

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:04.740
previous Porsche.
 

00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:09.129
Now, is that plausible?
 

00:14:09.129 --> 00:14:16.220
 
 

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:22.080
Anyone think there's a problem
with that idea?

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.700
 
 

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.048
Yeah?
 

00:14:29.048 --> 00:14:30.980
Student:  The idea with
shoes.

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:33.989
If you're given one shoe you're
going to get absolutely no

00:14:33.989 --> 00:14:35.986
utility,
but if you're given two shoes,

00:14:35.986 --> 00:14:38.138
a right and a left,
then maybe you'll get more

00:14:38.138 --> 00:14:38.539
utility?
 

00:14:38.539 --> 00:14:40.428
Prof: Okay, so shoes.
 

00:14:40.428 --> 00:14:44.330
If we just kept giving you lots
of right shoes,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.279
there'd be a problem.
 

00:14:46.279 --> 00:14:46.668
Student:  Right.
 

00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:48.894
Prof: Okay,
so I think Bentham would have

00:14:48.894 --> 00:14:51.309
to say it would have to be pairs
of shoes, right?

00:14:51.309 --> 00:14:53.379
Student:  Yeah, I guess.
 

00:14:53.379 --> 00:14:56.769
Prof: Okay,
but that's a great example to

00:14:56.769 --> 00:14:58.429
start us off on this.
 

00:14:58.429 --> 00:15:00.379
What else?
 

00:15:00.379 --> 00:15:04.679
Anything else anyone might find
problematic?

00:15:04.679 --> 00:15:06.250
Yeah, over here.
 

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:09.196
Student:  Well,
it just seems that if we're

00:15:09.196 --> 00:15:12.744
going by diminishing margin
utility that if you had everyone

00:15:12.744 --> 00:15:15.450
literally dirt poor and always
starving,

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:17.870
if you give them just a little
bit of something their happiness

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:19.941
would increase so much more
because they got that much

00:15:19.941 --> 00:15:22.019
little,
but people would still be

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:23.950
living in misery technically.
 

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.408
Prof: Just explain that
a little more.

00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:28.924
Student:  Well,
marginal utility is if you had

00:15:28.924 --> 00:15:31.730
a little bit of something for
the first time your happiness

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.149
increases so much more because
the first time.

00:15:34.149 --> 00:15:37.769
So if you were to give people
very little food,

00:15:37.769 --> 00:15:40.274
or anything at all,
and then you suddenly gave them

00:15:40.274 --> 00:15:42.179
a little bit they would get
really,

00:15:42.179 --> 00:15:43.340
really happy about it.
 

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:46.072
But by this then also if
they're also very wealthy and

00:15:46.072 --> 00:15:48.960
they got something more they
wouldn't really be happy.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:52.288
So it'd be more beneficial to
the utility if they only got a

00:15:52.288 --> 00:15:54.940
little bit so they would be
very, very happy.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:55.533
Prof: Okay.
 

00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:56.889
That's a very sophisticated
observation.

00:15:56.889 --> 00:16:00.038
I'm just going to put it one
side and come back to it in

00:16:00.038 --> 00:16:03.590
about ten minutes when I start
talking about redistribution.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:04.629
Okay.
 

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:08.004
But anything else about--if
we're still focusing on one

00:16:08.004 --> 00:16:10.509
individual,
anything else that might be

00:16:10.509 --> 00:16:14.250
problematic with this notion of
diminishing marginal utility?

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.399
Over here?
 

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:19.668
Student:  Well,
let's say you're C.

00:16:19.668 --> 00:16:21.768
Just because you're rich
doesn't mean you don't want to

00:16:21.768 --> 00:16:23.774
be more rich,
and just because you have a

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:26.900
certain amount of money doesn't
mean more money isn't going to

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.259
make you equally as happy as it
did before.

00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:32.306
Prof: Okay,
that's true,

00:16:32.306 --> 00:16:35.149
but why is it problematic?
 

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:37.690
Student:  I don't know.
 

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.346
Prof: Well,
I think you hit on something

00:16:39.346 --> 00:16:40.029
really important.
 

00:16:40.029 --> 00:16:43.763
There are a lot of people who
think that the principle of

00:16:43.763 --> 00:16:47.230
diminishing marginal utility
means that money is less

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.428
important to people as they have
more of it.

00:16:50.428 --> 00:16:54.033
After we said the principle of
diminishing marginal utility of

00:16:54.033 --> 00:16:55.509
all good things,
right?

00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:58.710
Money is a way of purchasing
good things,

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:02.844
so your example might be
thought to suggest that this

00:17:02.844 --> 00:17:07.693
implies the more money you have
the less important money is to

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.778
you,
okay?

00:17:09.778 --> 00:17:14.368
So you're right,
but notice what that means.

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:18.460
Does it mean that rich people
will care less about money?

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:24.368
 
 

00:17:24.368 --> 00:17:28.555
It's a tricky question because
the first impulse is to say,

00:17:28.555 --> 00:17:31.875
"Yes, they'll care less
about money,"

00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:33.680
but the answer is no.
 

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.049
Why is the answer no?
 

00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:39.038
Yeah?
 

00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:41.138
Student:  They just need
more money to get the same

00:17:41.138 --> 00:17:41.950
amount of happiness.
 

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.221
Prof: Exactly.
 

00:17:43.221 --> 00:17:46.556
They need more money to get the
same amount of happiness

00:17:46.556 --> 00:17:49.465
precisely because of the
principle of diminishing

00:17:49.465 --> 00:17:50.798
marginal utility.
 

00:17:50.798 --> 00:17:54.955
So you got it exactly right to
see that money creates some

00:17:54.955 --> 00:17:58.748
problematic examples for the
principle of diminishing

00:17:58.748 --> 00:18:00.278
marginal utility.
 

00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:04.210
But the thing that follows from
it is that,

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:08.528
for Donald Trump to get more
utility,

00:18:08.528 --> 00:18:12.820
you have to give him a huge
amount of new money just for him

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.258
to get the same amount of new
utility as somebody who only has

00:18:17.258 --> 00:18:20.440
ten thousand dollars,
right?

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.943
So the way to think about the
desire for money it's a bit like

00:18:24.943 --> 00:18:27.750
sort of a heroin addict needs
more,

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:30.559
and more, and more new heroin
to get the same hit,

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:35.009
right?
 

00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:37.750
So the more money you have,
actually the more money you

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.540
will want in order to get the
next marginal increment of

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:41.150
utility.
 

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:46.560
So we should expect rich people
to be greedy by this theory,

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.240
not to become more and more
indifferent to money.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.538
Very important assumption and a
lot of people get that wrong

00:18:55.538 --> 00:18:59.108
when they think about the
principle of diminishing

00:18:59.108 --> 00:19:00.640
marginal utility.
 

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.763
Are there any other examples of
this doctrine that might make it

00:19:05.763 --> 00:19:07.309
seem problematic?
 

00:19:07.309 --> 00:19:08.778
Yeah, over there.
 

00:19:08.778 --> 00:19:11.938
Student:  Well,
if I had a second Porsche Turbo

00:19:11.938 --> 00:19:15.634
I would be just really reckless
with it and I could do whatever

00:19:15.634 --> 00:19:16.288
I want.
 

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:19.160
I wouldn't have to protect the
first Porsche Turbo as much.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.910
Prof: Yeah?
 

00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.759
Student:  I mean it's
like there's more you can do

00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:25.930
with it, right?
 

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.710
Prof: Yeah,
so why is that a problem?

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.480
Student:  Well,
then wouldn't the second car--

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.193
I mean, like,
say if you have a little bit

00:19:33.193 --> 00:19:36.769
and you're given a little bit
your utility goes up,

00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:40.048
but you really want to protect
that little bit,

00:19:40.048 --> 00:19:42.604
but when you get more maybe it
encourages you to save money,

00:19:42.604 --> 00:19:43.470
to not spend more.
 

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:44.970
Prof: So you wouldn't
want the second one?

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:46.038
Student:  What?
 

00:19:46.038 --> 00:19:48.098
Prof: Are you saying you
wouldn't want the second one?

00:19:48.098 --> 00:19:49.587
Student:  Well,
why wouldn't I want the second

00:19:49.587 --> 00:19:49.759
one?
 

00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:50.910
Prof: If you had one and
I said,

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.337
"I'll give you my one,
it's right out there,"

00:19:53.337 --> 00:19:54.118
you wouldn't want it?
 

00:19:54.118 --> 00:19:55.690
Student:  It's not that
I wouldn't want it.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.404
Prof: You wouldn't be
like Jay Leno,

00:19:58.404 --> 00:20:00.990
who--how many cars does Jay
Leno have?

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.548
Student:  Too many.
 

00:20:01.548 --> 00:20:04.460
It's not that I wouldn't want
it, but maybe the utility for

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.369
the second one in some cases
would be more than the utility

00:20:07.369 --> 00:20:10.130
for the first one so the curve
would be thrown off.

00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:11.980
Prof: Because?
 

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.567
Student:  Because you
want to protect that first one,

00:20:15.567 --> 00:20:18.788
so, I mean, so you don't lose
what little you have.

00:20:18.788 --> 00:20:21.818
Prof: Okay,
so it's a possibility.

00:20:21.818 --> 00:20:26.250
Any other examples of where
this becomes problematic?

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:31.630
I mean, think about beer.
 

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.660
One beer increases your utility
a lot.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.801
The next, and the next,
and the fourteenth,

00:20:39.801 --> 00:20:45.423
isn't it going to at some--you
know, or taking an aspirin,

00:20:45.423 --> 00:20:48.579
isn't it going to,
you know?

00:20:48.579 --> 00:20:49.940
No?
 

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.460
Student:  What about
other values like integrity?

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:57.189
If you have a little bit of
integrity and you get some more,

00:20:57.189 --> 00:21:00.665
but if you have a lot of
integrity, a little bit more is

00:21:00.665 --> 00:21:02.690
still worth an equal amount.
 

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:07.355
Prof: So integrity is a
great example because once you

00:21:07.355 --> 00:21:11.009
start putting values like that
out there it,

00:21:11.009 --> 00:21:13.814
I think, threatens the idea
that it's all reducible to a

00:21:13.814 --> 00:21:15.940
single index,
right?

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:22.318
Because you can't--having a
little bit of integrity is sort

00:21:22.318 --> 00:21:27.269
of like being a little bit
pregnant, right?

00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:34.566
Once Eliot Spitzer's integrity
is blown it's not like there's

00:21:34.566 --> 00:21:37.848
some--it's a binary good.
 

00:21:37.848 --> 00:21:39.868
You either have it or you
don't, right?

00:21:39.868 --> 00:21:43.054
People either think he's either
a hypocrite or he's not,

00:21:43.054 --> 00:21:44.269
it' a binary thing.
 

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:47.652
Maybe some people are somewhat
hypocritical,

00:21:47.652 --> 00:21:51.034
but it seems like there's a
threshold there,

00:21:51.034 --> 00:21:53.078
one side or the other.
 

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:58.477
So there might be some goods
like integrity that are not

00:21:58.477 --> 00:22:02.009
easily capture-able in this
logic.

00:22:02.009 --> 00:22:08.838
We should put that out there,
but yeah, over here?

00:22:08.838 --> 00:22:10.509
Student:  What about
health?

00:22:10.509 --> 00:22:14.358
It's not quite binary because
you can be in medium health,

00:22:14.358 --> 00:22:17.215
but I think it would be pretty
useful to be healthy and then

00:22:17.215 --> 00:22:21.230
super healthy,
ad infinitum.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:26.118
Professor Ian Shapiro: Health.
 

00:22:26.118 --> 00:22:28.390
The thing about health it's
tricky.

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:31.148
Actually less so in our day
than Bentham's,

00:22:31.148 --> 00:22:34.303
it's tricky to think about
redistributing health,

00:22:34.303 --> 00:22:34.960
right?
 

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:41.239
Although you'll see we will
come up against some pretty

00:22:41.239 --> 00:22:43.098
bizarre cases.
 

00:22:43.098 --> 00:22:46.894
If some people are sighted and
some people are blind and you

00:22:46.894 --> 00:22:50.494
could do eye transplants,
should we be transplanting from

00:22:50.494 --> 00:22:52.358
the sighted to the blind?
 

00:22:52.358 --> 00:22:56.513
Arguably the blind person would
gain more utility from getting

00:22:56.513 --> 00:23:01.009
one eye than the sighted person
would lose from losing one eye,

00:23:01.009 --> 00:23:02.500
so shouldn't we do that?
 

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:08.616
So that can also give you some
ways of proceeding that would

00:23:08.616 --> 00:23:12.660
make you queasy,
right, if you allow the

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.430
principle of diminishing
marginal utility.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:23.808
What about the examples I threw
out there, beer and aspirins?

00:23:23.808 --> 00:23:27.557
They're a bit like the sort of
left shoe examples,

00:23:27.557 --> 00:23:28.170
right?
 

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.105
I don't think those are
actually deep problems for

00:23:31.105 --> 00:23:34.519
Bentham's theory because I think
what he would say is,

00:23:34.519 --> 00:23:38.731
"Well, you'd drink beer
and at some point you would sell

00:23:38.731 --> 00:23:42.733
the beer rather than make
yourself paralytically drunk and

00:23:42.733 --> 00:23:44.420
feel terrible."
 

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:48.675
You'd sell the beer and use
that to buy some other good that

00:23:48.675 --> 00:23:52.211
would give you increasing
utility at a diminishing

00:23:52.211 --> 00:23:53.509
marginal rate.
 

00:23:53.509 --> 00:24:00.192
So the main thing is that the
fungibility of utility and its

00:24:00.192 --> 00:24:04.269
expressibility in terms of
money,

00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:08.288
although as was pointed out
here, when we think about the

00:24:08.288 --> 00:24:11.588
diminishing marginal utility
even of money,

00:24:11.588 --> 00:24:14.811
we shouldn't think that that
makes you care less about money

00:24:14.811 --> 00:24:18.318
the richer you get;
rather it will make you care

00:24:18.318 --> 00:24:21.858
more about money the richer that
you get.

00:24:21.858 --> 00:24:27.660
Okay, now, here's a historical
statement about the principle of

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:30.558
diminishing marginal utility.
 

00:24:30.558 --> 00:24:35.637
Every serious economist since
the eighteenth century has

00:24:35.637 --> 00:24:41.178
assumed that the principle of
diminishing marginal utility is

00:24:41.178 --> 00:24:44.410
true, including Jeremy Bentham.
 

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:49.652
You can't do economics without
assuming that the principle of

00:24:49.652 --> 00:24:53.058
diminishing marginal utility is
true.

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:57.253
And I think if you threw out
some of these problematic

00:24:57.253 --> 00:25:03.462
instances like integrity,
I think that what Bentham would

00:25:03.462 --> 00:25:06.325
have said,
or what any economist would

00:25:06.325 --> 00:25:08.303
have said,
"Well, yes,

00:25:08.303 --> 00:25:13.269
there are some things that are
not capture-able easily,

00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:19.107
or easily captured by this
idea, but if you want to get it

00:25:19.107 --> 00:25:20.790
right,
if you want to see how people

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:22.897
are going to behave,
if you want to get it right,

00:25:22.897 --> 00:25:26.227
it's a better assumption than
any of the competing assumptions

00:25:26.227 --> 00:25:27.210
you could make.
 

00:25:27.210 --> 00:25:31.364
It's going to get you closer to
the truth more of the time than

00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:35.384
not assuming the principle of
diminishing marginal utility is

00:25:35.384 --> 00:25:36.390
true."
 

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:40.873
So Bentham would have probably
said that, I think,

00:25:40.873 --> 00:25:46.087
if questioned or if somebody
had probed with some of these

00:25:46.087 --> 00:25:48.009
counter examples.
 

00:25:48.009 --> 00:25:53.234
So it's the best assumption you
can make given that you've got

00:25:53.234 --> 00:25:55.118
to assume something.
 

00:25:55.118 --> 00:26:00.651
But now, and now I want to come
back to the sophisticated point

00:26:00.651 --> 00:26:05.826
that was made in the middle at
the back there a few minutes

00:26:05.826 --> 00:26:08.506
ago,
when you start to think about

00:26:08.506 --> 00:26:12.130
the utility that people at the
bottom of the social order

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:16.365
derive from a particular good,
versus the utility that the

00:26:16.365 --> 00:26:20.362
people at the top of the social
order derive from some

00:26:20.362 --> 00:26:23.621
particular good,
because in Bentham's scheme,

00:26:23.621 --> 00:26:27.400
remember,
we are allowing comparisons

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.690
across individuals.
 

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:33.460
Let's suppose a two-person
society,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:40.710
again, and let's suppose it
consists of Donald Trump--

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:44.865
well, it can be a multi-person
society but we're just going to

00:26:44.865 --> 00:26:47.592
focus on two:
Donald Trump and a homeless

00:26:47.592 --> 00:26:51.476
woman living out of a left
luggage locker in Grand Central

00:26:51.476 --> 00:26:52.430
Station.
 

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:59.367
Actually there are no lockers
at Grand Central but there are

00:26:59.367 --> 00:27:03.250
at Penn, at Penn Station,
okay?

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.580
And the question is,
should we take a dollar from

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:09.079
Trump and give it to the bag
lady.

00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:11.869
What? Should we? Yes? No?
 

00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:14.400
How many think yes?
 

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.109
Okay, yeah, almost everybody.
 

00:27:18.109 --> 00:27:19.940
Why?
 

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.308
Because by assumption with the
principle of diminishing

00:27:23.308 --> 00:27:26.990
marginal utility we take the
dollar from Trump up there,

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.481
his loss of utility is
negligible, but we give it to

00:27:31.481 --> 00:27:34.828
the woman who's starving down
here,

00:27:34.828 --> 00:27:38.920
and her gain in utility is
enormous from that dollar,

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:39.980
right?
 

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:42.980
So we should take the dollar
from Trump.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.471
Let's assume there's no dead
weight loss to the government

00:27:45.471 --> 00:27:46.869
and all of that for right now.
 

00:27:46.869 --> 00:27:49.180
We will just keep it simple.
 

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:52.482
We should take that dollar from
Trump and we should give it to

00:27:52.482 --> 00:27:55.016
the bag lady,
and the greatest happiness of

00:27:55.016 --> 00:27:57.430
the greatest number will have
increased,

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.088
right?
 

00:28:00.088 --> 00:28:04.221
But then maybe we should take
another dollar,

00:28:04.221 --> 00:28:05.630
shouldn't we?
 

00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:10.096
I mean it worked the first
time, so we should take a second

00:28:10.096 --> 00:28:13.560
dollar from Trump and give it to
the bag lady,

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:16.950
and a third dollar,
and a fourth dollar.

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:22.339
When are we going to stop?
 

00:28:22.339 --> 00:28:26.829
When are we going to stop?
 

00:28:26.829 --> 00:28:28.230
Yeah?
 

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.670
Student:
&gt;

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.972
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Yeah, we're going to stop at

00:28:32.972 --> 00:28:34.769
the point of perfect equality,
right?

00:28:34.769 --> 00:28:37.869
We're going to keep
redistributing until they have

00:28:37.869 --> 00:28:39.009
the same amount.
 

00:28:39.009 --> 00:28:46.102
So now you should be able to
start to see why classical

00:28:46.102 --> 00:28:52.799
utilitarianism was a doctrine
that was thought to be

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:59.630
profoundly radical and
frightening to rich men,

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:04.148
because it has this built-in
impetus for downward

00:29:04.148 --> 00:29:05.750
redistribution.
 

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.368
You can say well,
there'll be cost,

00:29:07.368 --> 00:29:09.930
there'll be dead weight loss to
the state and so on,

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:14.181
but still the underlying logic
says take it from Trump and give

00:29:14.181 --> 00:29:17.108
it to the bag lady,
right?

00:29:17.108 --> 00:29:19.818
At the margin that's what you
should do.

00:29:19.818 --> 00:29:27.538
And Bentham completely saw that
this was an implication of his

00:29:27.538 --> 00:29:28.930
doctrine.
 

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.598
Now, Bentham was a fairly
radical guy.

00:29:31.598 --> 00:29:35.007
He was a supporter of
democracy, which was a radical

00:29:35.007 --> 00:29:36.410
thing at that time.
 

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:41.009
But he wasn't as egalitarian as
all that,

00:29:41.009 --> 00:29:47.655
and he wanted to temper the
downward redistribution that

00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:54.179
flows from his principle,
and so he makes a distinction

00:29:54.179 --> 00:29:59.375
between what he refers to as
"absolute"

00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:03.490
and "practical"
equality.

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:05.808
He says, Suppose but a
commencement made,

00:30:05.808 --> 00:30:08.358
by the power of a government of
any kind,

00:30:08.358 --> 00:30:11.700
in the design of establishing
it (absolute equality,

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.598
that's redistributing to
equality),

00:30:14.598 --> 00:30:17.180
the effect would be--that,
instead of every one's having

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:20.088
an equal share in the sum of the
objects of general desire--

00:30:20.088 --> 00:30:25.019
and in particular the means of
subsistence,

00:30:25.019 --> 00:30:27.446
and the matter of abundance,
no one would have any share of

00:30:27.446 --> 00:30:27.950
it at all.
 

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:32.067
Before any division of it could
be made, the whole would be

00:30:32.067 --> 00:30:34.213
destroyed;
and destroyed,

00:30:34.213 --> 00:30:36.801
along with it,
by those whom,

00:30:36.801 --> 00:30:42.255
as well as those for the sake
of whom, the division had been

00:30:42.255 --> 00:30:43.548
ordained.
 

00:30:43.548 --> 00:30:47.788
He's basically saying,
if you want to reduce that to a

00:30:47.788 --> 00:30:52.972
bumper sticker,
he's saying the rich will burn

00:30:52.972 --> 00:30:58.588
their crops before giving them
to the poor,

00:30:58.588 --> 00:31:01.808
and that is a common argument
in politics.

00:31:01.808 --> 00:31:07.183
It's the sort of reverse of
trickle-down,

00:31:07.183 --> 00:31:08.259
right?
 

00:31:08.259 --> 00:31:13.305
Trickle-down is the notion that
you allow inequality because the

00:31:13.305 --> 00:31:17.470
rich will create more wealth for
everybody, right?

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:21.913
The pie bigger for everybody,
and so the greatest amount of

00:31:21.913 --> 00:31:25.440
utility is increased by allowing
inequality.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.308
This is the inverse claim.
 

00:31:28.308 --> 00:31:30.038
Bentham's saying,
"Well yes,

00:31:30.038 --> 00:31:33.550
in principle absolute equality
would maximize the greatest

00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:35.769
happiness of the greatest
number,

00:31:35.769 --> 00:31:38.400
but in fact if a government set
out to do that,

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.470
the rich would rebel."
 

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:47.230
And this is a claim that is
often made in everyday politics.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:51.990
So you'll destroy incentives to
work,

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:56.626
is the claim that you'll hear
when we have arguments about

00:31:56.626 --> 00:32:00.940
raising taxes in the run up to
the fall elections,

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:03.130
right?
 

00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:08.961
In the transition to democracy
in South Africa people said the

00:32:08.961 --> 00:32:14.887
white farmers will destroy their
farms before turning them over

00:32:14.887 --> 00:32:16.799
to the majority.
 

00:32:16.799 --> 00:32:20.548
It turned out not to be true.
 

00:32:20.548 --> 00:32:25.692
So those examples put on the
table, what sort of force does

00:32:25.692 --> 00:32:27.288
this claim have?
 

00:32:27.288 --> 00:32:34.680
It's really an empirical claim,
and we don't really know how

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:41.818
much the rich will tolerate
before burning their crops.

00:32:41.818 --> 00:32:46.930
Presumably they'll allow some
redistributive taxation,

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:50.310
but we don't know how much,
and a lot of the day-to-day

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:53.130
argument of politics turns
around how much.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:56.904
So Bentham makes a distinction
between absolute and practical

00:32:56.904 --> 00:32:58.252
equality,
and he says,

00:32:58.252 --> 00:33:01.519
"We should redistribute to
the point of practical equality,

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:06.413
but not to the point of
absolute equality because

00:33:06.413 --> 00:33:12.227
redistributing beyond practical
equality has this perverse

00:33:12.227 --> 00:33:17.528
counter-trickle-down logic and
that's not going to be

00:33:17.528 --> 00:33:22.526
acceptable from the standpoint
of the principle of

00:33:22.526 --> 00:33:24.769
utility."
 

00:33:24.769 --> 00:33:30.990
Okay, so when you allow both
interpersonal comparisons of

00:33:30.990 --> 00:33:37.098
utility and you assume
diminishing marginal utility,

00:33:37.098 --> 00:33:41.598
utilitarianism becomes a very
radical doctrine.

00:33:41.598 --> 00:33:45.608
You can hedge it in to some
extent with claims of this sort,

00:33:45.608 --> 00:33:50.674
but they are themselves
controversial and you're going

00:33:50.674 --> 00:33:56.601
to get into a very messy world
of macroeconomic predictions and

00:33:56.601 --> 00:34:01.953
counter-predictions about
whether and when you reach this

00:34:01.953 --> 00:34:08.652
point of practical equality,
or when the gains from downward

00:34:08.652 --> 00:34:15.572
redistribution are offset by the
losses from the shrinking of the

00:34:15.572 --> 00:34:16.329
pie.
 

00:34:16.329 --> 00:34:20.659
Now, some of you might have
said, "Well,

00:34:20.659 --> 00:34:23.449
at the beginning of this course
of lectures,

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:28.635
Shapiro said,
'Every Enlightenment thinker is

00:34:28.635 --> 00:34:31.699
committed to postulants.
 

00:34:31.699 --> 00:34:35.929
One is that we can have a
scientific theory of politics,

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:39.351
and the other is that
individual freedom

00:34:39.351 --> 00:34:44.351
operationalizes a doctrine of
rights is the most important

00:34:44.351 --> 00:34:45.230
good.'
 

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.574
Now, having sat through these
lectures on Bentham,

00:34:48.574 --> 00:34:51.510
I can see what he's saying
about science.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:55.929
Bentham has this monomaniacal
view of science.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.650
He's got his objective egoism.
 

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:03.173
He can figure it all out,
what will maximize social

00:35:03.173 --> 00:35:05.327
utility,
and run around the world

00:35:05.327 --> 00:35:07.340
writing constitutions for
people,

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.731
can devise a whole public
policy that's going to

00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:14.340
scientifically maximize the
utility of society,

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:18.768
but I'm not seeing a whole lot
of room for rights in this

00:35:18.768 --> 00:35:19.639
doctrine.
 

00:35:19.639 --> 00:35:24.489
It seems to allow ethnic
cleansing, even genocide.

00:35:24.489 --> 00:35:28.887
It seems to allow
redistribution from one person

00:35:28.887 --> 00:35:34.782
to another, all justified on the
grounds that this is maximizing

00:35:34.782 --> 00:35:37.869
the total utility of society.
 

00:35:37.869 --> 00:35:41.864
Well, even if it is,
how does this respect

00:35:41.864 --> 00:35:44.400
individual rights?"
 

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.650
 
 

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:49.965
Am I just wrong?
 

00:35:49.965 --> 00:35:54.000
Is there some elementary thing
I've missed here?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.289
There's not much room for
rights in Bentham's doctrine.

00:36:00.289 --> 00:36:04.590
So I'm just wrong that these
Enlightenment thinkers were

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:07.170
committed to individual rights?
 

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:11.641
It would be a reasonable
inference from what I'm said so

00:36:11.641 --> 00:36:12.130
far.
 

00:36:12.130 --> 00:36:18.239
But remember,
for Bentham when we try to

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:28.579
maximize utility in the society,
individual motivation is vital.

00:36:28.579 --> 00:36:32.340
This is a passage I read to you
last week,

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.512
but I'm just repeating it,
"The great enemies of

00:36:35.512 --> 00:36:38.869
public peace are the selfish and
dissocial passions--

00:36:38.869 --> 00:36:43.750
necessary as they are...Society
is held together only by the

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:47.721
sacrifices that men can be
induced to make of the

00:36:47.721 --> 00:36:52.353
gratifications they demand:
to obtain these sacrifices is

00:36:52.353 --> 00:36:57.427
the great difficulty,
the great task of

00:36:57.427 --> 00:37:00.349
government."
 

00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:06.250
He's saying you have to work
with individual motivations.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:11.192
You can't ignore them,
and I think that is the point

00:37:11.192 --> 00:37:16.909
that's behind his distinction
between absolute and practical

00:37:16.909 --> 00:37:18.170
equality.
 

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.179
The rich will burn their crops
before giving them to the poor.

00:37:21.179 --> 00:37:22.909
You have to take that into
account.

00:37:22.909 --> 00:37:31.440
You have to see individuals as
the basic generators of utility.

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.942
In another piece of Bentham's
writing which I didn't have you

00:37:34.942 --> 00:37:37.791
read,
but I'll just put it out there

00:37:37.791 --> 00:37:41.998
because it's where you start to
see our old friend the

00:37:41.998 --> 00:37:45.652
workmanship ideal creeping by
the backdoor into

00:37:45.652 --> 00:37:47.239
utilitarianism.
 

00:37:47.239 --> 00:37:50.440
Bentham says,
"Law does not say to man,

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.612
Work and I will reward
you but it says:

00:37:53.612 --> 00:37:56.760
Labour,
and by stopping the hand that

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:01.036
would take them from you,
I will ensure you the fruits of

00:38:01.036 --> 00:38:04.369
your labour--
its natural and sufficient

00:38:04.369 --> 00:38:08.510
reward, which without me you
cannot preserve.

00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:12.300
 If industry creates,
it is law which preserves.

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:16.018
If at the first we owe
everything to labour;

00:38:16.018 --> 00:38:18.708
at the second,
and every succeeding moment,

00:38:18.708 --> 00:38:20.820
we owe everything to law."
 

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.130
So another way of thinking
about this is,

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:29.179
that Bentham's idea of the
state is essentially regulatory.

00:38:29.179 --> 00:38:35.141
It stays the hand of somebody
else who would steal your goods,

00:38:35.141 --> 00:38:40.030
but the government cannot
itself create utility.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:44.722
Labor creates utility,
and this is why I say that

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:47.862
workmanship,
that idea that we first

00:38:47.862 --> 00:38:50.768
confronted when we talked about
Locke,

00:38:50.768 --> 00:38:55.760
comes into utilitarianism by
the backdoor,

00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:00.329
because Bentham's going to say,
"Unless you respect

00:39:00.329 --> 00:39:04.981
individual rights you're not
going to be able to maximize

00:39:04.981 --> 00:39:08.719
utility for the society as a
whole."

00:39:08.719 --> 00:39:12.945
So the state is basically a
regulative state,

00:39:12.945 --> 00:39:18.612
not a state that's actively
involved in creating utility for

00:39:18.612 --> 00:39:20.150
individuals.
 

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:25.780
It will do some redistribution
to the point of practical

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:29.577
equality,
but the basic idea is that the

00:39:29.577 --> 00:39:34.798
state should be hands-off with
respect to the utility creation

00:39:34.798 --> 00:39:36.340
in the society.
 

00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.817
It's industry that creates
utility--labor,

00:39:39.817 --> 00:39:44.990
work--so incentives are going
to be important going forward if

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:48.130
you're going to maximize
utility.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:54.447
So that's the way in which we
see that even a classical

00:39:54.447 --> 00:40:01.233
utilitarian like Bentham is
going to resist dispensing with

00:40:01.233 --> 00:40:05.679
the doctrine of individual
rights.

00:40:05.679 --> 00:40:12.838
Now, there's a problem,
though, with his mode of doing

00:40:12.838 --> 00:40:17.096
this,
and the problem arises because

00:40:17.096 --> 00:40:23.235
the claim that the rich will
burn their crops before giving

00:40:23.235 --> 00:40:27.260
them to the poor might not be
true.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:31.284
And even if we get to less
extreme circumstances like South

00:40:31.284 --> 00:40:34.199
Africa before and after the
transition,

00:40:34.199 --> 00:40:39.360
when we look at actual debates
in contemporary politics in the

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:43.230
United States,
this is what we see.

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:48.510
Ronald Reagan comes in and
says, this is in 1980,

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:53.284
"If we cut taxes,
the pie will get bigger for all

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:57.067
and they'll be actually more
revenue,"

00:40:57.067 --> 00:41:00.400
and so utilitarianism says do
it.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.661
And the Democrats say,
"No, they won't,"

00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:05.860
and it's an empirical argument.
 

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:11.233
And you will find,
if you go back now and look at

00:41:11.233 --> 00:41:16.461
what happened during the 1980s,
perfectly credible economists

00:41:16.461 --> 00:41:19.210
will line up on both sides
because they cut the taxes,

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:22.673
but, of course,
eight other things happened as

00:41:22.673 --> 00:41:25.599
well that affect the
macro-economy,

00:41:25.599 --> 00:41:27.780
right?
 

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:32.630
And disentangling how much the
tax cuts were responsible for

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.106
what happened,
versus how much many other

00:41:36.106 --> 00:41:39.300
things that happened were
responsible,

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:43.829
nobody really knows.
 

00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:47.496
Or if you look at the current
debate we watched and are

00:41:47.496 --> 00:41:50.619
watching unfold about the
economic stimulus.

00:41:50.619 --> 00:41:57.639
If the economy turns around
between now and November,

00:41:57.639 --> 00:42:03.730
the Democrats will probably do
a lot better than if it doesn't,

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:07.090
but the Republicans will say,
"Well,

00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:11.242
it would have turned around
faster if we hadn't had all this

00:42:11.242 --> 00:42:12.440
taxation."
 

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.373
And Paul Krugman will say,
"Well, it would have

00:42:15.373 --> 00:42:18.940
turned around even faster if we
had had more taxation."

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:24.900
And so a lot of the problem in
debating incentives,

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:29.264
once you get into the real
world of macroeconomic

00:42:29.264 --> 00:42:33.606
policy-making,
is that (a) you never have the

00:42:33.606 --> 00:42:37.228
counterfactual;
you can't go and rerun history

00:42:37.228 --> 00:42:40.708
without the stimulus,
right, or without the Reagan

00:42:40.708 --> 00:42:41.559
tax cuts.
 

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:46.068
And (b) the sheer complexity;
so many other things

00:42:46.068 --> 00:42:49.010
happened--the price of oil goes
up,

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:52.010
or the commodities collapse,
or the dollar,

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:54.480
or this, or that,
or the Chinese revalue,

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.989
do or don't change the value of
their currency.

00:42:57.989 --> 00:43:05.632
So that when it gets down to
it, you're never going to get a

00:43:05.632 --> 00:43:12.500
definitive answer to the
question what is the point of

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.480
practical equality.
 

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:20.032
When have we passed the point
of practical equality,

00:43:20.032 --> 00:43:22.800
to use Bentham's terminology?
 

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:23.610
Are we close to it?
 

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:24.440
Have we gone by it?
 

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.150
Are we nowhere near it?
 

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:31.737
There have been periods in our
history when we've had top

00:43:31.737 --> 00:43:35.929
marginal tax rates of 90
percent, right?

00:43:35.929 --> 00:43:40.202
Reagan thought a top marginal
tax rate of 40 percent was

00:43:40.202 --> 00:43:43.389
beyond the point of practical
equality.

00:43:43.389 --> 00:43:47.255
You're never going to get a
definitive resolution of those

00:43:47.255 --> 00:43:48.070
questions.
 

00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:52.742
But if we think back to what
the aspiration of the early

00:43:52.742 --> 00:43:55.969
Enlightenment was,
it was certainty.

00:43:55.969 --> 00:44:00.744
To use the example,
remember, I read to you from

00:44:00.744 --> 00:44:06.739
Hobbes, from his Epistle
Dedicatory to his Six Lessons to

00:44:06.739 --> 00:44:10.599
the Professors of
Mathematics;

00:44:10.599 --> 00:44:14.023
he said, "For the things
we don't make,

00:44:14.023 --> 00:44:18.322
we can't know we can only guess
about the causes,"

00:44:18.322 --> 00:44:19.119
right?
 

00:44:19.119 --> 00:44:23.449
Well, here we're guessing about
the causes.

00:44:23.449 --> 00:44:28.815
We don't really know and there
will be--the people who want

00:44:28.815 --> 00:44:34.367
either policy will be able to
find a plausible set of experts

00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:36.679
to defend their view.
 

00:44:36.679 --> 00:44:40.820
So you're getting to this very
messy world of macroeconomic

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:45.400
prediction,
if you want to put some limits

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:51.250
on the radical edge of classical
utilitarianism.

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:59.010
And as a matter of history,
that's not how it went.

00:44:59.010 --> 00:45:03.940
As a matter of history,
how it went was to rethink the

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:08.686
analytical structure of
utilitarianism in a way that

00:45:08.686 --> 00:45:14.456
completely defanged its radical
redistributive edge without any

00:45:14.456 --> 00:45:20.039
reference to these messy
macroeconomic considerations.

00:45:20.039 --> 00:45:24.364
And just how that happened in
the transition from classical to

00:45:24.364 --> 00:45:28.264
what we're going to all
neoclassical utilitarianism is a

00:45:28.264 --> 00:45:31.739
subject with which I will begin
on Wednesday.

00:45:31.739 --> 00:45:32.849
See you then.
 

00:45:32.849 --> 00:45:38.000

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.541
Prof: So we have begun
by talking about general

00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:08.897
equilibrium,
and this was the background to

00:00:08.897 --> 00:00:11.880
the course so that you're all
familiar.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.281
Those of you who haven't taken
freshman economics or

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:18.682
intermediate economics,
what's the background that's

00:00:18.682 --> 00:00:20.550
required for the course?
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.499
And the fact that general
equilibrium is a part of finance

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:27.349
is,
as I say, a bit of an

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.021
innovation because most finance
courses are taught entirely

00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.300
independently of economic
theory.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.333
But the two greatest Yale
economists and two greatest Yale

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:41.650
financial economists had finance
and economics integrated,

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.966
and I believe that's the only
right way of looking at the

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:44.380
problem.
 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.003
And as I said at the very
beginning, I think the events of

00:00:47.003 --> 00:00:49.120
the last few years have
confirmed that view.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.994
So let's take up the question
today of why is the free market

00:00:52.994 --> 00:00:54.350
supposedly so good.
 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.934
So we worked out two examples
last time, and the two examples

00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:03.289
are very similar to the first
problem set that you did.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.930
In the first example you've got
two agents A and B,

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.361
and whenever we write agents A
and B we really mean a million

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:13.450
agents just like A and a million
agents just like B.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.771
The heart of perfect
competition in the economy is

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:19.441
that there's lots of people,
and so we can't--yeah,

00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:24.849
I think from now on hand them
in at the end of class.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:30.025
So we mean a million people of
type A and a million people type

00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:30.360
B.
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.971
So the utility function of A,
the welfare function of A is

00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:35.312
written there,
and the welfare function of B

00:01:35.312 --> 00:01:37.900
is written and they each begin
with endowments.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.598
So when these two million
people come together they're

00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:43.857
going to be doing the same thing
that you saw in the class on the

00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:44.569
first day.
 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.550
They're going to be haggling,
and arguing,

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.925
and the buyers are going to
always say "the stuff's not

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:52.218
worth very much and why should
they pay you so much,"

00:01:52.218 --> 00:01:54.232
and the sellers are going to
say "it's worth a

00:01:54.232 --> 00:01:56.364
tremendous amount and they
should pay even more,"

00:01:56.364 --> 00:01:58.580
and eventually they're going to
come to prices.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.188
And we discovered last time
that the way of describing what

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:05.361
prices and what final
allocations they come to is by

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:07.849
writing down a system of
equations,

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:11.375
and you did that all in your
homework and we came up with

00:02:11.375 --> 00:02:12.318
this outcome.
 

00:02:12.318 --> 00:02:16.165
So similarly we did another
problem in the last class and we

00:02:16.165 --> 00:02:19.947
wrote down different welfare
functions or utility functions

00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:23.990
and different endowments and
again we got the equilibrium.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.342
So we said that one of the
amazing things is that these

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:30.452
system of equations,
the six equations for each

00:02:30.452 --> 00:02:34.139
economy that you solved in class
always have a solution.

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.561
So the people who discovered
that discovered it at the Cowles

00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:39.520
Foundation.
 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.157
They were Ken Arrow,
Gerard Debreu who was a Yale

00:02:43.157 --> 00:02:46.462
assistant professor,
Ken Arrow who was visiting the

00:02:46.462 --> 00:02:49.590
Cowles Foundation in Chicago but
was a Stanford professor,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.800
and Lionel McKenzie who
actually taught at Rochester.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.729
The economic equations always
have a solution.

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.628
So what's so good about that
economic solution?

00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:02.100
Adam Smith talked about the
invisible hand,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.818
but there was no mathematics in
Adam Smith.

00:03:05.818 --> 00:03:09.389
So why do we think equilibrium
is such a good thing?

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:12.508
After all, you saw in the
example that there were three

00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:15.628
pairs of people who forlornly
couldn't trade at all.

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:18.978
So clearly not everybody gets
to trade, discrimination

00:03:18.978 --> 00:03:19.610
happens.
 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.580
Some people get the stuff.
 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.318
Other people don't get the
stuff.

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:30.395
Well, the first approach of
economists was that equilibrium

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:34.990
maximizes the sum of utilities.
 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:43.280
So let's see how that works in
this example.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.591
So this example's very special
because everybody thinks that

00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:51.098
the good Y has constant marginal
utility of 1.

00:03:51.098 --> 00:03:54.631
So that's going to play a big
role in our optimization in

00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:56.650
maximizing the sum of utility.
 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:08.982
So if you want to maximize the
sum of utilities you have to

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:19.826
maximize (100X^(A) -
碼^(A) squared) (30X^(B)

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:32.795
- 碼^(B) squared) (Y^(A)
Y^(B)) such that X^(A) X^(B) =

00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:45.980
84 which is the sum of 4 and 80
and Y^(A) Y^(B) = 6,000.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.103
So the claim is that if all
these two million people meet in

00:04:49.103 --> 00:04:51.910
a room like this and start
shouting at each other,

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.180
and trading and offering deals
and stuff,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.416
it's going to come down to a
final allocation which we've

00:04:57.416 --> 00:05:00.944
written over there were A gets
77 of the first good and B gets

00:05:00.944 --> 00:05:04.069
7 of the first good,
and that final allocation is

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.470
going to maximize the sum of
utilities.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.120
So why should that be the case?
 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.829
In fact in this example it is
the case.

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:11.430
Well why is it the case?
 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.420
Because there's constant
marginal utility of Y,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.564
so we don't have to worry about
the Y allocation at all because

00:05:19.564 --> 00:05:23.242
if you increase Y^(A) and
decrease Y^(B) they still have

00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.778
to add up to 6,000.
 

00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:28.403
You're going to be lowering A's
utility and raising B's utility

00:05:28.403 --> 00:05:31.560
by the same amount so you won't
have changed the sum of

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.379
utilities.
 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.543
So the Y's are totally
irrelevant to this maximizing

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:36.970
the sum of utilities.
 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.538
So all we have to do is make
sure that the X allocation,

00:05:40.538 --> 00:05:43.589
maximize the sum of utilities
for the good X.

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:48.954
So that you can see must be the
case because we have to maximize

00:05:48.954 --> 00:05:52.956
the sum of two people's
utilities or two million

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:54.149
utilities.
 

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:57.646
You can always plug in X^(B) as
a function of X^(A),

00:05:57.646 --> 00:06:00.939
namely 84 [clarification:
X^(B) = 84 - X^(A)].

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:07.220
So let's write it as a function
of X^(A),

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.127
and we can replace this
maximization by recognizing that

00:06:12.127 --> 00:06:15.338
X^(B) is just a function of
X^(A).

00:06:15.338 --> 00:06:19.579
In fact, it's a very special
function where the derivative of

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.949
X^(B) with respect to X^(A)--
so let's call the function,

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.220
we'll call it that to denote
that it's a function--

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.759
happens to equal -1.
 

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:33.377
So we want to maximize this
over X^(A) taking into account

00:06:33.377 --> 00:06:36.779
that X^(B) is just a function of
X^(A),

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:40.949
because to maximize you have to
keep feasible.

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:44.319
So we've now ignored all the
constraints.

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:47.971
Constraints have now
disappeared provided we keep

00:06:47.971 --> 00:06:52.079
track of the fact that X^(B) is
a function of X^(A).

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:58.608
So why is it the case that the
equilibrium 77 and 7 maximizes

00:06:58.608 --> 00:06:59.370
this?
 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.220
Well, the key is diminishing
marginal utility.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.180
We know that the utility
function for--

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:11.764
here's X--utility function for
A is quadratic so it looks

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:15.927
something like that,
and the utility function for B

00:07:15.927 --> 00:07:17.920
also looks something like that.
 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.641
And so if you look at this
function entirely as a function

00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:26.040
of A it's also going to look
like that.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:40.468
So by diminishing marginal
utility, the function,

00:07:40.468 --> 00:07:50.690
the sum of utilities is
concave.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.980
Concave, remember,
is a picture like that.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.329
So what is the essence of a
picture like that?

00:07:55.329 --> 00:08:06.300
It means that setting
derivative equal to zero implies

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:09.819
you are at max.
 

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:11.819
So that's not true of any
function.

00:08:11.819 --> 00:08:14.055
If you have a function like
that and then it goes up like

00:08:14.055 --> 00:08:16.211
that you could have the
derivative of zero here and not

00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:18.800
really be at the max,
but because there's diminishing

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.850
marginal utility more and more
of X does less and less good so

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:22.699
it turns down.
 

00:08:22.699 --> 00:08:26.680
So all you have to do is figure
out that the derivative is zero,

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.281
which it is at this point,
and then you know you're at the

00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:31.040
maximum.
 

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:37.330
But that at X^(A) = 77 has to
be the case because if you plug

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:43.306
in X^(A) = 77 and you take the
derivative of all this with

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:47.710
respect to X^(A) of this whole
thing,

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:50.897
taking into account as before
that X^(B) is a function of

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:56.301
X^(A),
you just get (100 - X^(A)) now

00:08:56.301 --> 00:09:05.595
it's just going to be (30 -
X^(B)) times the derivative of

00:09:05.595 --> 00:09:10.649
X^(B) with respect to X^(A).
 

00:09:10.649 --> 00:09:11.250
Why is that?
 

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.404
Because you know the chain
rule, if I differentiate

00:09:13.404 --> 00:09:16.163
everything with respect to X^(A)
and X^(B) is a function of X^(A)

00:09:16.163 --> 00:09:18.792
it's just 30 because I'm taking
the derivative with respect to

00:09:18.792 --> 00:09:19.308
X^(B).
 

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:23.340
So it's 30 times the derivative
of X^(B) with respect to X^(A)

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.039
minus the derivative with
respect to X^(B) is X^(B) times

00:09:27.039 --> 00:09:30.409
the derivative of X^(B) with
respect to X^(A),

00:09:30.409 --> 00:09:31.668
so it's that.
 

00:09:31.668 --> 00:09:39.350
But if you plug in X^(A) = 77
and X^(B) = 7,

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:48.548
DX^(B), DX^(A) is -1 you just
get 23 - 23 = 0,

00:09:48.548 --> 00:09:51.118
because the marginal utility of
A is equal to the marginal

00:09:51.118 --> 00:09:52.470
utility of B at equilibrium.
 

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.621
The sum of utilities is
maximized, and that's the end of

00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:56.308
the story.
 

00:09:56.308 --> 00:09:59.269
So that you noticed in the
problem set, something like

00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.658
that.
 

00:09:59.658 --> 00:10:01.168
You may not have given exactly
this argument.

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:03.990
That's what you were supposed
to have sort of discovered in

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.957
doing the problem set and now
we've confirmed what you already

00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:07.980
pretty much knew.
 

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.610
So are there any questions
about that?

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.477
It's just the simple
generalization of our football

00:10:16.477 --> 00:10:19.576
ticket example where the
football tickets end up in the

00:10:19.576 --> 00:10:22.330
hands of the people who want
them the most,

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:24.408
and A happens to like a lot of
tickets,

00:10:24.408 --> 00:10:27.601
not just one,
and so A's going to keep buying

00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:30.428
tickets until he's bought 77 of
them.

00:10:30.428 --> 00:10:33.820
And by then the next football
ticket is worth less than 23 to

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:34.158
him.
 

00:10:34.158 --> 00:10:36.269
B, she likes football tickets a
little less.

00:10:36.269 --> 00:10:38.048
She's not going to buy as many.
 

00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:42.462
By the time she gets down to 7
football tickets she's going to

00:10:42.462 --> 00:10:45.720
think--so she hasn't bought
nearly as many.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.989
When she's gotten to 7 football
tickets she's going to think the

00:10:48.989 --> 00:10:50.649
next one's worth less than 23.
 

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:54.985
And since the price is 23
they're going to both stop

00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:57.125
there,
but they're each going to stop

00:10:57.125 --> 00:11:00.058
at the same point where the last
ticket is worth the same to each

00:11:00.058 --> 00:11:02.125
of them,
and all the previous football

00:11:02.125 --> 00:11:04.788
tickets each bought is worth
more to each of them.

00:11:04.788 --> 00:11:07.542
So there's no way of
rearranging the tickets because

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:10.835
if you did you'd have to take a
football ticket that was worth

00:11:10.835 --> 00:11:13.856
more than 23 from one of them
and give that ticket to the

00:11:13.856 --> 00:11:17.419
other one who by then would
think it was worth less than 23.

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:20.990
So that's the argument.
 

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:21.690
Okay.
 

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.683
So economists were beside
themselves with their brilliance

00:11:25.683 --> 00:11:29.957
in having proved this theorem
and given a mathematical form to

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:31.570
the invisible hand.
 

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:34.403
Whenever you take a verbal
argument like Adam Smith and

00:11:34.403 --> 00:11:37.341
turn it into a mathematical
argument you've understood it

00:11:37.341 --> 00:11:37.918
better.
 

00:11:37.918 --> 00:11:41.293
You understand why it's true
and you also start to understand

00:11:41.293 --> 00:11:44.048
why in some circumstances it
might not be true.

00:11:44.048 --> 00:11:46.899
So for 50 years,
let's say between 30 and 50

00:11:46.899 --> 00:11:50.544
years this was the fundamental
argument of economics and

00:11:50.544 --> 00:11:54.057
economic equilibrium that
equilibrium was a good thing

00:11:54.057 --> 00:11:57.240
because it maximized the sum of
utilities.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.220
But then little by little,
starting with Irving Fisher and

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.408
a bunch of people at the same
time and a little bit later,

00:12:03.408 --> 00:12:06.178
so Hicks and Samuelson are
famous for this,

00:12:06.178 --> 00:12:09.947
they began to wonder what kind
of crazy utility functions are

00:12:09.947 --> 00:12:12.961
these where there's some
mysterious good that has

00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:15.158
constant marginal utility of 1.
 

00:12:15.158 --> 00:12:18.808
So in modern terms how could
you justify it?

00:12:18.808 --> 00:12:21.532
You could say,
"Well, maybe there's a

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:25.649
machine where we can calibrate
exactly how happy people are and

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:27.110
we can measure it.
 

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:32.166
So for example,
we can measure how aroused

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:34.139
their skin is.
 

00:12:34.139 --> 00:12:39.549
The skin texture changes as you
become less and more aroused.

00:12:39.549 --> 00:12:40.908
Maybe we could measure that.
 

00:12:40.908 --> 00:12:43.220
With MRIs we can measure brain
waves.

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.404
Maybe you can calibrate how
many brain waves are spinning

00:12:45.404 --> 00:12:46.808
around and how happy somebody
is,

00:12:46.808 --> 00:12:49.317
and maybe there's some
mysterious good like food that

00:12:49.317 --> 00:12:51.149
has constant marginal
utility."

00:12:51.149 --> 00:12:54.253
Well, that doesn't seem very
persuasive to me and it wasn't

00:12:54.253 --> 00:12:56.928
to the economists of the
beginning of the twentieth

00:12:56.928 --> 00:12:57.570
century.
 

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:00.629
They all argued,
starting with Irving Fisher,

00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:04.365
that it made no sense to think
that we could actually measure

00:13:04.365 --> 00:13:06.682
utility,
and more than that it made even

00:13:06.682 --> 00:13:09.686
less sense there'd be some good
that had constant marginal

00:13:09.686 --> 00:13:10.528
utility of 1.
 

00:13:10.528 --> 00:13:13.898
So Fisher put everything on a
symmetric footing and said,

00:13:13.898 --> 00:13:16.485
"Let's think of the two
goods, X and Y,

00:13:16.485 --> 00:13:18.288
as more or less symmetric.
 

00:13:18.288 --> 00:13:20.837
I mean, there's no reason why
one has to have some special

00:13:20.837 --> 00:13:21.418
role."
 

00:13:21.418 --> 00:13:23.317
So let's look at this
equilibrium which we got the

00:13:23.317 --> 00:13:25.409
same way, and you did this on a
problem set solving for

00:13:25.409 --> 00:13:26.028
equilibrium.
 

00:13:26.028 --> 00:13:28.408
Does this maximize the sum of
utilities?

00:13:28.408 --> 00:13:32.639
Well, the answer is if it did
maximize the sum of utilities at

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:37.009
the final allocation we couldn't
gain anything by switching,

00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:40.482
reducing 9 fifths a little bit
and increasing 6 fifths a little

00:13:40.482 --> 00:13:40.820
bit.
 

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:43.710
But what is the sum of
utilities?

00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:53.410
So if you write W^(A) W^(B)
it's going to be for one thing

00:13:53.410 --> 00:14:01.070
(3 fourths log X^(A)) (2 thirds
log X^(B)).

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:06.690
So let's look at the marginal
utility to X^(A)--of good A.

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.846
That's 3 fourths,
so marginal utility of A,X

00:14:11.846 --> 00:14:18.561
marginal utility of B,X = 3
fourths times 1 over 9 fifths

00:14:18.561 --> 00:14:21.200
which is 5 ninths.
 

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:28.292
That equals 15 over 36,
which is 5 over 18 if I've done

00:14:28.292 --> 00:14:30.000
that right.
 

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.759
It doesn't sound right.
 

00:14:34.759 --> 00:14:37.559
Student: It's 5 over 12.
 

00:14:37.559 --> 00:14:38.490
Prof: 5 over 12.
 

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:39.279
Thank you.
 

00:14:39.279 --> 00:14:41.038
That sounds better.
 

00:14:41.038 --> 00:14:47.876
But let's look at--so this is
the margin utility of X^(A) is 5

00:14:47.876 --> 00:14:49.110
twelfths.
 

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:53.779
What's the marginal utility to
B of X?

00:14:53.779 --> 00:14:59.278
Well, it equals 2 thirds times
1 over 6 fifths,

00:14:59.278 --> 00:15:03.820
which is 5 sixths,
which is 10 over 18,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.450
which is 5 over 9.
 

00:15:06.450 --> 00:15:08.470
So these two numbers are
different.

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.932
The marginal utility to B is
bigger than the margin

00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:13.940
utility--of X--is bigger than
the margin utility to A of X.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.365
So clearly the final
equilibrium allocation doesn't

00:15:16.365 --> 00:15:17.918
maximize the sum of utilities.
 

00:15:17.918 --> 00:15:19.629
By switching some goods from A
to B you could make both people

00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:21.169
better off [clarification:
you could increase the sum of

00:15:21.169 --> 00:15:22.682
both peoples' utilities,
though one person would end up

00:15:22.682 --> 00:15:23.580
worse off in the process].
 

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.908
So that was a shock to
economists.

00:15:25.908 --> 00:15:27.950
It meant that the argument
they'd relied on,

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:32.101
the thing which they were using
to persuade policy people that

00:15:32.101 --> 00:15:34.690
the free markets were a good
thing,

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.808
is a false argument.
 

00:15:36.808 --> 00:15:38.706
It rests on a premise that's
indefensible,

00:15:38.706 --> 00:15:41.389
namely that there's constant
marginal utility and everybody

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:42.269
can measure it.
 

00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:45.509
So they needed some other
definition, some other way of

00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:49.048
capturing the mathematical idea
that the invisible hand is a

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:49.950
good thing.
 

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.158
And the reason I'm spending so
much time emphasizing this,

00:15:52.158 --> 00:15:53.740
even though you've seen this
before,

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:56.988
is because if economists made a
mistake once what makes you

00:15:56.988 --> 00:15:59.340
think they haven't made another
mistake?

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:05.143
So now let's give the argument
that in a weaker sense the

00:16:05.143 --> 00:16:09.765
invisible hand holds,
that is that the free market

00:16:09.765 --> 00:16:13.428
comes to a very socially
desirable equilibrium.

00:16:13.428 --> 00:16:16.249
And later in the course we're
going to find that that argument

00:16:16.249 --> 00:16:17.220
is also too narrow.
 

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.961
So my point that I'm going to
gradually get to is that

00:16:20.961 --> 00:16:25.196
economists have constantly taken
too narrow and too special a

00:16:25.196 --> 00:16:28.530
view of the world,
and as you enlarge the view of

00:16:28.530 --> 00:16:30.831
the world you have,
not by making things

00:16:30.831 --> 00:16:33.380
mathematically simpler,
actually you have to make them

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.058
mathematically slightly more
complicated,

00:16:35.058 --> 00:16:38.351
as you enlarge the view of the
world you have you get closer to

00:16:38.351 --> 00:16:41.697
the truth and you start to find
that the free market isn't quite

00:16:41.697 --> 00:16:44.990
as wonderful as you thought at
first and therefore there's room

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:46.690
for government regulation.
 

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.308
So it's not,
as Paul Krugman argued,

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:54.152
that economists are transfixed
by mathematics and seduced into

00:16:54.152 --> 00:16:58.360
simple conclusions that the free
market is perfect.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.518
On the contrary I would say
they were afraid of too much

00:17:01.518 --> 00:17:03.703
mathematics,
and by looking too narrowly

00:17:03.703 --> 00:17:06.304
they didn't realize what they
could have just by being

00:17:06.304 --> 00:17:08.118
mathematically more
sophisticated.

00:17:08.118 --> 00:17:09.832
So it's a failure of
sophistication,

00:17:09.832 --> 00:17:11.298
not too much sophistication.
 

00:17:11.298 --> 00:17:14.150
So what did the economists
argue?

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:17.048
So the chief among them,
Hicks, Samuelson,

00:17:17.048 --> 00:17:20.510
Pareto and Fisher,
all these people basically came

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:22.420
to the same conclusion.
 

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:26.634
They said, "Well,
it makes no sense to talk about

00:17:26.634 --> 00:17:28.940
the sum of utilities."
 

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:35.470
Let's talk about Pareto
Efficiency.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.848
So what's the general problem?
 

00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:41.878
The general problem is you
start with an economy made up of

00:17:41.878 --> 00:17:43.960
all these individuals.
 

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.250
Let's call them W^(A) and
W^(B),

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:51.720
but it could be as many as we
want so let's just say W^(i)--

00:17:51.720 --> 00:18:00.880
and E^(i), so E^(i) is the
endowment of X and E^(i) of Y.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.490
So that's the economy.
 

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:09.868
You start from the economy and
you go to equilibrium.

00:18:09.868 --> 00:18:14.410
And equilibrium is a price
vector P_X

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:18.259
P_Y and allocations
X^(i),

00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:25.211
Y^(i), i in I,
such that summation over all

00:18:25.211 --> 00:18:34.317
the i's of X^(i) equals the
summation for all the i's of

00:18:34.317 --> 00:18:37.960
E^(i)_X.
 

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.209
So i's final consumption of X,
plus j's final consumption of

00:18:42.209 --> 00:18:43.760
X,
plus everybody else's final

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.686
consumption of X,
those are the sum of the

00:18:45.686 --> 00:18:47.194
X^(i)'s,
is equal to the sum of

00:18:47.194 --> 00:18:48.298
everybody's endowment.
 

00:18:48.298 --> 00:18:53.272
And similarly for the Y's,
[equals the sum]

00:18:53.272 --> 00:19:00.259
of E^(i)_Y and such
that everybody is doing what's

00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:07.720
in their personal interest which
is maximizing W^(i) of X,

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:14.873
Y, so, the max of W^(i) of X,
Y such that [(P_X

00:19:14.873 --> 00:19:18.859
times X) (P_Y times
Y)]

00:19:18.859 --> 00:19:23.967
= [(P_X times
E^(i)_X)

00:19:23.967 --> 00:19:28.826
(P_Y times
E^(i)_Y)]

00:19:28.826 --> 00:19:34.950
is solved by X^(i),
Y^(i) for all i.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:36.450
That's the definition of
equilibrium.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:39.605
Everybody individually
optimizes looking at his own

00:19:39.605 --> 00:19:41.753
budget set,
the hell with everybody else,

00:19:41.753 --> 00:19:44.298
does the best in his interest,
chooses X^(i),

00:19:44.298 --> 00:19:47.700
Y^(i) at the going prices,
supply equals demand,

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:49.848
that's how you get the final
allocation.

00:19:49.848 --> 00:19:52.215
So that's the definition of
equilibrium and now we're trying

00:19:52.215 --> 00:19:53.460
to argue that's a good thing.
 

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:57.348
So what's our criterion?
 

00:19:57.348 --> 00:20:02.528
Well, what Pareto and Edgeworth
and everybody else decided is,

00:20:02.528 --> 00:20:07.480
"Let's look at the welfare
functions W^(A) and W^(B)."

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.965
So if you take some allocation
like the original allocation 2-1

00:20:11.965 --> 00:20:15.440
and 1-2 you'll have a welfare of
each person,

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.470
(3 fourths log 2) (one quarter
log 1) that's the welfare of A,

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:25.450
and the welfare of B will be (2
thirds log 1) (1 third log 2),

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:30.108
so that'll be some point here.
 

00:20:30.108 --> 00:20:46.420
So this is welfare B,
welfare A at initial endowment.

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:50.348
And then if you look at the
welfare at the final allocation,

00:20:50.348 --> 00:20:53.845
so, (3 fourths log 9 fifths) (1
quarter log 3 halves) you know

00:20:53.845 --> 00:20:56.079
it's going to be something like
this.

00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:57.029
It's got to be up here.
 

00:20:57.029 --> 00:20:59.140
It's going to be better for
both people.

00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.288
How do you know that?
 

00:21:00.288 --> 00:21:03.623
Because A had the choice of
just buying his initial

00:21:03.623 --> 00:21:07.222
endowment--that's always
affordable and he chose not to

00:21:07.222 --> 00:21:07.890
do it.
 

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.328
He chose to do something else
and he was better off and the

00:21:10.328 --> 00:21:12.313
same with B,
so clearly the equilibrium

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:15.490
allocation is going to be better
than the initial endowment.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:34.048
And so the Pareto criterion is
that an allocation X^(i)-hat,

00:21:34.048 --> 00:21:47.970
Y^(i)-hat, Pareto dominates an
allocation--

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:57.180
so this is for all I--X^(i),
let's put the i's on the top.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:03.288
If and only if everybody's
better off: W^(i) (X^(i)-hat,

00:22:03.288 --> 00:22:09.990
Y^(i)-hat) is bigger than
W^(i)(X^(i), Y^(i)).

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:14.330
So we started with an
allocation, the E allocation

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:19.470
here, and then we moved to
competitive equilibrium here and

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:22.038
everybody was better off.
 

00:22:22.038 --> 00:22:25.971
So the equilibrium allocation
Pareto dominates the initial

00:22:25.971 --> 00:22:26.868
allocation.
 

00:22:26.868 --> 00:22:31.459
But now the question is maybe
there's some other allocation

00:22:31.459 --> 00:22:35.414
besides the competitive
equilibrium allocation that

00:22:35.414 --> 00:22:38.660
dominates the equilibrium
allocation.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:51.019
So the theorem is that if P,
(X^(i) Y^(i)),

00:22:51.019 --> 00:23:06.910
i in I is an equilibrium for
the economy E--

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:15.359
remember we defined the economy
E, I better put E here--

00:23:15.359 --> 00:23:28.462
then no allocation (X^(i)-hat,
Y^(i)-hat), i in I,

00:23:28.462 --> 00:23:42.029
Pareto dominates (X^(i),
Y^(i)) if summation X^(i)-hat

00:23:42.029 --> 00:23:50.134
equals summation
E^(i)_X and

00:23:50.134 --> 00:23:54.498
summation--
got a little too tight here,

00:23:54.498 --> 00:23:57.890
sorry about this,
Y^(i)-hat equals,

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:02.058
this is over i,
equals summation

00:24:02.058 --> 00:24:04.750
E^(i)_Y.
 

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:06.730
So I can read this,
it's really bad.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.730
It's a critical line right in
the corner.

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:13.140
So I'll just say it in words
and then read it literally.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:16.028
So this allocation dominates
this one.

00:24:16.028 --> 00:24:19.410
The competitive equilibrium
dominated the initial endowment,

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:22.673
but maybe there's some other
way of rearranging the goods

00:24:22.673 --> 00:24:24.890
that gets you even further out
here.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.759
The theorem says that's
impossible.

00:24:27.759 --> 00:24:31.480
So it says if you start with a
competitive equilibrium,

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.660
with an allocation (X^(i),
Y^(i)) for the economy E,

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:40.798
the no allocation like that
one, no allocation (X^(i)-hat,

00:24:40.798 --> 00:24:43.509
Y^(i)-hat) can Pareto dominate
it.

00:24:43.509 --> 00:24:44.338
This couldn't happen.
 

00:24:44.338 --> 00:24:45.519
You'd have to be down here
somewhere.

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:49.202
That couldn't happen provided
this other allocation used up

00:24:49.202 --> 00:24:51.490
the resources that were
available.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:54.354
So the sum of the X's in this
allocation is the sum of the

00:24:54.354 --> 00:24:57.290
initial endowments,
and the sum of the Y's in this

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.648
allocation is the sum of the
initial endowments over the

00:25:00.648 --> 00:25:01.259
people.
 

00:25:01.259 --> 00:25:04.849
So of course if you add more
goods to the economy you can

00:25:04.849 --> 00:25:08.451
make everybody better off,
but using the existing goods in

00:25:08.451 --> 00:25:10.022
the economy,
which is the sum of the

00:25:10.022 --> 00:25:12.098
E^(i)_X's and the sum
of the E^(i)_Y's,

00:25:12.098 --> 00:25:14.575
there's no way to make everyone
better off than at the

00:25:14.575 --> 00:25:15.788
competitive equilibrium.
 

00:25:15.788 --> 00:25:19.816
So it says literally if P
(X^(i), Y^(i)) is an equilibrium

00:25:19.816 --> 00:25:21.903
for the economy E,
which is that,

00:25:21.903 --> 00:25:23.630
which includes the initial
endowments,

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:27.703
the no allocation (X^(i)-hat,
Y^(i)-hat) Pareto dominates

00:25:27.703 --> 00:25:31.054
(X^(I),
Y^(I)) if the sum over I of

00:25:31.054 --> 00:25:36.400
X^(i)-hat equals the sum over i
of E^(i)_X,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:43.424
and if the sum of the
Y^(i)-hats over i equals the sum

00:25:43.424 --> 00:25:47.269
of the E^(i)_Y's.
 

00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:48.808
That's the theorem.
 

00:25:48.808 --> 00:25:52.598
So we've totally weakened the
definition of equilibrium.

00:25:52.598 --> 00:25:59.135
So it might be that if this is
the competitive allocation if

00:25:59.135 --> 00:26:05.230
you look at this line this is
same sum of utilities,

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:08.664
because if this slope is -1 and
here's the utility to B and the

00:26:08.664 --> 00:26:11.990
utility to A everything on this
line has the same utility.

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.988
So that theorem would say
anything else that's feasible

00:26:14.988 --> 00:26:16.210
had to be down here.
 

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.009
The sum is less than that.
 

00:26:19.009 --> 00:26:20.269
But here we're not saying that.
 

00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:21.750
We're no longer saying that.
 

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.328
Maybe you can increase the sum.
 

00:26:23.328 --> 00:26:26.430
From this equilibrium you could
increase the sum by taking

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.769
something away from A and giving
it to B.

00:26:28.769 --> 00:26:30.029
You could increase the sum.
 

00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:32.720
So that would have been here.
 

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.416
You increase the sum,
so you no longer have maximized

00:26:36.416 --> 00:26:38.454
the sum,
but the fact is to make B

00:26:38.454 --> 00:26:41.267
better off you had to make A
worse off and that's the new

00:26:41.267 --> 00:26:44.980
criterion,
Pareto Efficiency.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.976
So that's the theorem and now
we're going to prove it so that

00:26:48.976 --> 00:26:53.039
you can see the whole logic of
the free market just amounts to

00:26:53.039 --> 00:26:53.640
that.
 

00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.880
So are there any questions
about this?

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.492
You all supposedly saw this
before, but that doesn't mean

00:26:58.492 --> 00:26:59.588
you really did.
 

00:26:59.588 --> 00:27:01.328
So does anyone have a question
what's going on?

00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:07.868
This is a very basic incredibly
important idea.

00:27:07.868 --> 00:27:11.309
All right, so I'll give you one
more chance.

00:27:11.309 --> 00:27:13.559
Somebody must have a question.
 

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:14.930
Yes?
 

00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:17.002
Student: Could you just
re-say the theorem a little bit

00:27:17.002 --> 00:27:17.480
more slowly?
 

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.019
Prof: Yes.
 

00:27:18.019 --> 00:27:21.612
Why don't I draw a picture,
which is what I was going to do

00:27:21.612 --> 00:27:22.170
anyway?
 

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:30.406
So let's draw a picture,
and I'll bring the theorem back

00:27:30.406 --> 00:27:35.348
after having drawn the picture.
 

00:27:35.348 --> 00:27:39.150
So the picture is going to be
due to Edgeworth.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.029
So he invented the indifference
curve and he invented it in

00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:43.470
order to draw this picture.
 

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.990
It was an incredibly clever
picture.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.131
So he says, "Let's look at
this economy,"

00:27:48.131 --> 00:27:49.930
the one on the right that we
start with.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:55.968
We put X^(A) here and X^(B)
here and you notice that A

00:27:55.968 --> 00:28:00.068
begins with an endowment of
(2,1).

00:28:00.068 --> 00:28:06.038
So let's put his endowment
(2,1) here.

00:28:06.038 --> 00:28:15.346
So this is E^(A)_X =
2 and this is E^(A)_Y

00:28:15.346 --> 00:28:17.329
= 1, right?
 

00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:18.460
That makes sense.
 

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:20.993
Now we can draw his
indifference curves through

00:28:20.993 --> 00:28:21.380
that.
 

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.990
So his indifference curves he
likes X more than he likes Y,

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.778
so the indifference curves are
going to be sort of vertical.

00:28:26.778 --> 00:28:32.522
He doesn't like to give up X
very much, so his indifference

00:28:32.522 --> 00:28:36.980
curves are going to look sort of
like this.

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.511
And the most important
indifferent curves are the ones

00:28:39.511 --> 00:28:41.710
where he gets better off than he
was before.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:47.146
So now in the end there's going
to be a budget set which is X is

00:28:47.146 --> 00:28:54.064
way more expensive than Y,
so there's going to be a budget

00:28:54.064 --> 00:28:57.910
set that looked like this.
 

00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:01.548
That's sort of the budget set
that he faces.

00:29:01.548 --> 00:29:03.838
And he's not going to choose
this.

00:29:03.838 --> 00:29:11.571
It turns out he chooses
something like here which is he

00:29:11.571 --> 00:29:20.451
chooses a little bit less of X,
9 fifths, and a little bit more

00:29:20.451 --> 00:29:21.740
of Y.
 

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:27.952
So here's X^(A) = 9 fifths
which is a little less than 2,

00:29:27.952 --> 00:29:32.278
and X^(B) he chose was,
I can't read it,

00:29:32.278 --> 00:29:36.049
3 halves which is more than 1.
 

00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:37.710
Are you with me?
 

00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:38.859
You asked the question.
 

00:29:38.859 --> 00:29:40.210
Does this picture make sense?
 

00:29:40.210 --> 00:29:41.118
Student: Yes.
 

00:29:41.118 --> 00:29:45.122
Prof: So he obviously
did better than he did before,

00:29:45.122 --> 00:29:48.088
but we've got another guy to
worry about.

00:29:48.088 --> 00:29:51.640
So how can you put the second
guy in the same diagram?

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:57.539
Well, let's just add the total
endowment.

00:29:57.539 --> 00:29:58.599
Where's the total endowment?
 

00:29:58.599 --> 00:30:00.720
Well, it's 3 units of each.
 

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.859
So here we've got 2.
 

00:30:01.859 --> 00:30:10.368
So this is 1,2, this must be 3.
 

00:30:10.368 --> 00:30:15.141
So the total endowment of good
X is 3,2 1 is 3 and a good Y is

00:30:15.141 --> 00:30:16.079
3 as well.
 

00:30:16.079 --> 00:30:18.529
Here's 1, here's 2, here's 3.
 

00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:23.299
This is supposed to be a square.
 

00:30:23.299 --> 00:30:25.509
The aggregate endowment is here.
 

00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:38.259
This is the total endowment,
3 of each.

00:30:38.259 --> 00:30:41.730
What are the feasible
allocations?

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.058
So this is an extremely clever
insight of Edgeworth's.

00:30:44.058 --> 00:30:47.358
He said, "Look,
the total endowment is (3,3).

00:30:47.358 --> 00:30:51.553
If I tell you that A has got
(2,1) (that's this point) what's

00:30:51.553 --> 00:30:54.279
left over, B must be
consuming."

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:58.144
So B's consuming the distance
from here to here which is

00:30:58.144 --> 00:30:59.410
obviously (1,2).
 

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:03.170
And if A ends up over here at 9
fifths,

00:31:03.170 --> 00:31:07.848
3 halves, that's from here to
here is 9 fifths and 3 halves,

00:31:07.848 --> 00:31:11.811
since the total is (3,3) B's
obviously consuming what's left

00:31:11.811 --> 00:31:13.864
over,
so he's consuming this

00:31:13.864 --> 00:31:14.690
difference.
 

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:18.156
So whatever A does you can see
in the diagram looking at it the

00:31:18.156 --> 00:31:20.270
normal way,
but if you just sort of twist

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:22.750
your mind a little bit and look
from this direction,

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.215
once you know what A's doing
you can figure out what B's

00:31:25.215 --> 00:31:28.605
doing,
so each of these points defines

00:31:28.605 --> 00:31:30.818
a feasible allocation.
 

00:31:30.818 --> 00:31:33.865
And now what we want to say,
the theorem says,

00:31:33.865 --> 00:31:37.183
look at the utilities that A
and B got out of this

00:31:37.183 --> 00:31:38.200
allocation.
 

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.660
A is on this indifference curve.
 

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.470
You know what he's doing.
 

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.609
B you know is coming from here.
 

00:31:43.609 --> 00:31:46.318
We know how he's doing.
 

00:31:46.318 --> 00:31:48.769
So look at the allocation they
got.

00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:52.337
You can't make both people
better off than that by choosing

00:31:52.337 --> 00:31:54.430
some other point in this square.
 

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.190
So let's look at it from B's
point of view.

00:31:58.190 --> 00:32:01.180
From B's point of view B likes
more of everything.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.960
So if A gets less B's going to
get more.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.056
So from B's point of view the
further out you go this way the

00:32:08.056 --> 00:32:09.490
better it is for B.
 

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:13.220
So the axes for B looks like
that.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:24.263
So he's going to have some
indifference curve that--B's

00:32:24.263 --> 00:32:33.058
indifference curve has to look
like this.

00:32:33.058 --> 00:32:39.688
So here's where B started here,
and then B's going to be better

00:32:39.688 --> 00:32:42.038
off doing like this.
 

00:32:42.038 --> 00:32:44.240
So B's indifference curve looks
something like that.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:50.480
Those are B's indifference
curves.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.798
So the further out you go this
way the better off B is,

00:32:53.798 --> 00:32:56.150
so as you shrink what A gets,
that obviously means B's

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:59.652
getting more,
and so B's getting happier and

00:32:59.652 --> 00:33:00.490
happier.
 

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:04.038
So what is the definition of
Pareto Efficiency?

00:33:04.038 --> 00:33:07.150
Whatever point we pick like
this one to begin with:

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.259
is there a way of making both
people better off.

00:33:10.259 --> 00:33:12.137
Well the answer is the
competitive equilibrium makes

00:33:12.137 --> 00:33:13.059
both people better off.
 

00:33:13.059 --> 00:33:13.778
Why is that?
 

00:33:13.778 --> 00:33:17.384
If you can see it from back
there, the reason is that A went

00:33:17.384 --> 00:33:20.928
from this white indifference
curve to a better indifference

00:33:20.928 --> 00:33:22.150
curve over here.
 

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:26.369
B, whose budget line is the
same budget line looked at from

00:33:26.369 --> 00:33:29.790
his point of view,
he went from his indifference

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:32.118
curve over here to one here.
 

00:33:32.118 --> 00:33:35.390
So he went from this yellow
indifference curve to a better

00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:38.489
one, so both of them got better
off going to this final

00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:40.670
allocation than they started
with.

00:33:40.670 --> 00:33:43.894
And of course that had to be
true because A could always have

00:33:43.894 --> 00:33:45.990
chosen to stay where he was at
(2,1).

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.240
He moved to (9 fifths,
3 halves) because it was

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:51.029
better, and B could have stayed
where she was at (1,2).

00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:54.452
She chose to go to (6 fifths,
3 halves) because it made her

00:33:54.452 --> 00:33:57.134
better off,
so both of them must be better

00:33:57.134 --> 00:34:00.720
off at the final allocation than
they were to begin with.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.308
What does the theorem say?
 

00:34:02.308 --> 00:34:04.380
The theorem says--remember,
in pictures,

00:34:04.380 --> 00:34:08.195
it says whatever point we pick
here that defines something for

00:34:08.195 --> 00:34:11.907
A and defines something for B,
then we can look at the utility

00:34:11.907 --> 00:34:14.936
welfare functions of both and
see what indifference curves

00:34:14.936 --> 00:34:15.679
they're on.
 

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:18.940
The theorem says there's no
other point in this whole

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.766
diagram which puts both A and B
on a higher indifference curve

00:34:22.766 --> 00:34:26.969
for each of them than they were
at the competitive equilibrium.

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:30.489
So if I read the definition
again it says,

00:34:30.489 --> 00:34:33.838
if I start with an economy
there with the endowments and

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:36.322
the utility functions,
so the endowments and the

00:34:36.322 --> 00:34:39.380
indifference curves,
and I compute the competitive

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.199
equilibrium like we did over
there,

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:45.914
then no allocation,
that means no point in that box

00:34:45.914 --> 00:34:49.777
could make everybody better off
than they were at the

00:34:49.777 --> 00:34:54.679
competitive equilibrium provided
that new point is in the box.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:59.983
So it makes the sum of the X's
equal to the sum of the

00:34:59.983 --> 00:35:05.688
endowments, and the sum of the
Y's equal to the sum of the

00:35:05.688 --> 00:35:07.690
endowments of Y.
 

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:08.789
This is the end of the proof.
 

00:35:08.789 --> 00:35:11.980
We already gave the proof
according to Edgeworth.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.630
So what's the proof according
to Edgeworth?

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:15.931
He says, "It's all a
matter of looking at it the

00:35:15.931 --> 00:35:16.730
right way."
 

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:19.300
It's easy to look at the
picture from A's point of view.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:23.480
You just look at the X-axis and
the Y-axis.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:30.150
This is the Y-axis.
 

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.860
What is this?
 

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:37.960
This is X^(A)_Y.
 

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.179
It was 3 halves.
 

00:35:39.179 --> 00:35:43.969
So this is the Y-axis going
this way.

00:35:43.969 --> 00:35:48.018
This is the Y-axis and this is
the X-axis going this way.

00:35:48.018 --> 00:35:51.532
For A it's very simple to look
at the Y-axis and the X-axis for

00:35:51.532 --> 00:35:51.760
A.
 

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:58.860
A's got its indifference curve
getting better and better.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.989
So from A's point of view it's
very simple,

00:36:00.989 --> 00:36:03.302
you look at the endowment,
you draw the budget line

00:36:03.302 --> 00:36:05.449
through it,
which is some linear line,

00:36:05.449 --> 00:36:08.967
and then A picks the best point
on that budget set drawing the

00:36:08.967 --> 00:36:11.213
tangent,
which is the white indifference

00:36:11.213 --> 00:36:12.820
curve to this point right here.
 

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.719
That's the best he can do.
 

00:36:14.719 --> 00:36:19.574
Now the trick is to see that
from B's point of view up here

00:36:19.574 --> 00:36:24.681
things look very similar because
B's endowment is also at this

00:36:24.681 --> 00:36:25.518
point.
 

00:36:25.518 --> 00:36:31.050
He's got 1 unit up here of X
and 2 units of Y.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.340
Why does he have that?
 

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.447
Because the two together added
up to 3, so if this is what A's

00:36:35.447 --> 00:36:38.045
endowment was then of course
what's left over is B's

00:36:38.045 --> 00:36:38.760
endowment.
 

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.369
So B has to go here.
 

00:36:40.369 --> 00:36:43.239
Now what does the budget set
look like for B?

00:36:43.239 --> 00:36:46.016
Well it's also a linear thing
with the same slope and it goes

00:36:46.016 --> 00:36:46.989
through this point.
 

00:36:46.989 --> 00:36:50.505
So from his point of view this
pink line is also his budget

00:36:50.505 --> 00:36:50.869
set.
 

00:36:50.869 --> 00:36:55.456
It goes from here all the way
down to where it hits his Y-axis

00:36:55.456 --> 00:36:56.360
down here.
 

00:36:56.360 --> 00:37:00.313
They've got the same budget set
just looked at from opposite

00:37:00.313 --> 00:37:00.849
sides.
 

00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:03.465
Now what is competitive
equilibrium and supply equals

00:37:03.465 --> 00:37:04.170
demand mean?
 

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:08.139
It means that when A chooses
this point as the best point,

00:37:08.139 --> 00:37:09.699
which happened to have been (9
fifths,

00:37:09.699 --> 00:37:14.510
3 halves), then B is happy to
choose what's left over as his

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.570
best point.
 

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:18.496
So his optimal point,
his indifference curve that's

00:37:18.496 --> 00:37:22.242
tangent to his budget set has to
be the same point looked at from

00:37:22.242 --> 00:37:24.409
his origin instead of A's
origin.

00:37:24.409 --> 00:37:25.469
That's the trick.
 

00:37:25.469 --> 00:37:30.050
So that's the key insight that
Edgeworth had,

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:33.844
his beautiful picture,
and now the point is that if

00:37:33.844 --> 00:37:37.489
the white indifference curve
looks like that,

00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:40.219
anything that makes A better
off has to be on this side of

00:37:40.219 --> 00:37:43.380
the white indifference curve and
the yellow indifference curve,

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.947
which is B's indifference
curve, anything that makes her

00:37:45.947 --> 00:37:48.610
better off has to be on this
side of the yellow curve,

00:37:48.610 --> 00:37:51.333
but the white curve goes that
way and the yellow curve goes

00:37:51.333 --> 00:37:51.849
that way.
 

00:37:51.849 --> 00:37:55.230
So there's no point that's
simultaneously above A's

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:59.219
indifference curve and also
above B's indifference curve.

00:37:59.219 --> 00:38:01.679
So therefore nothing could
Pareto dominate it.

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:04.099
So that's the Edgeworth proof.
 

00:38:04.099 --> 00:38:04.860
Yes?
 

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.782
Student: So no matter
what our point's going to be on

00:38:06.782 --> 00:38:08.737
our pink budget line because
that's &gt;

00:38:08.737 --> 00:38:08.900
down.
 

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.010
That's all the goods we have.
 

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.068
Prof: Right.
 

00:38:11.068 --> 00:38:14.409
The pink budget line describes
what you can afford to buy,

00:38:14.409 --> 00:38:17.699
describes the budget equation,
this equation,

00:38:17.699 --> 00:38:27.500
so everyone's going to choose
on the pink line.

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.679
This point is feasible.
 

00:38:28.679 --> 00:38:31.929
B gets almost nothing and A
gets almost everything.

00:38:31.929 --> 00:38:34.465
B's never going to let himself
be forced down there because B

00:38:34.465 --> 00:38:36.199
can choose something on the pink
line,

00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:42.210
so he's always going to choose
something better than that.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.018
So that's proof number one.
 

00:38:44.018 --> 00:38:46.039
I'm just going to give proof
number two.

00:38:46.039 --> 00:38:49.197
Most of you have seen this
before, but I'm going to give

00:38:49.197 --> 00:38:52.469
another proof and then I'm going
to see whether you really

00:38:52.469 --> 00:38:54.480
understand what all this means.
 

00:38:54.480 --> 00:39:06.050
So here's a second proof.
 

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:08.230
This is a much better proof.
 

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:11.090
I'm going to write this
algebraically.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:15.960
The proof of Arrow 1951 and
Debreu 1951 separately,

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.148
so this is called the
Fundamental Theorem of

00:39:20.148 --> 00:39:25.018
Economics, First Welfare Theorem
of Economics.

00:39:25.018 --> 00:39:27.786
So all this pictorial stuff
makes so many assumptions,

00:39:27.786 --> 00:39:30.606
there are only two kinds of
traders, there are only two

00:39:30.606 --> 00:39:31.130
goods.
 

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:35.250
They are consuming only on the
boundaries.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.255
I mean, they're never consuming
on the boundaries it's always in

00:39:37.255 --> 00:39:39.079
this,
you know, there are just so

00:39:39.079 --> 00:39:42.280
many special assumptions and
everything is two by two.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.869
It's just special case.
 

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:46.920
So let's give a much more
general proof of this theorem.

00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:49.809
So here we've got--two goods
won't play any role.

00:39:49.809 --> 00:39:51.250
There could be any number of
goods.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.228
There are two goods only here,
but there are many traders,

00:39:54.228 --> 00:39:55.639
lots and lots of traders.
 

00:39:55.639 --> 00:40:01.349
So, what's the proof that
(X^(i) hat, Y^(i) hat) couldn't

00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:03.489
Pareto dominate it?
 

00:40:03.489 --> 00:40:11.092
So supposed that we've
got--this is equal to summation

00:40:11.092 --> 00:40:18.840
X^(i)-hat, and this is equal to
summation Y^(i)-hat.

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:24.710
So we've got another allocation
which is feasible.

00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:27.646
So could it be that this other
feasible allocations of

00:40:27.646 --> 00:40:30.836
X^(i)-hat's and Y^(i)-hats,
could that make everybody

00:40:30.836 --> 00:40:31.570
better off?
 

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:34.344
Could that make each i better
off than (X^(i),

00:40:34.344 --> 00:40:34.900
Y^(i))?
 

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.530
And this proof is so short and
so beautiful,

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:42.315
so elegant, and so convincing
that it's mesmerized people now

00:40:42.315 --> 00:40:45.724
for over 50 years and it
prevents them from seeing that

00:40:45.724 --> 00:40:49.510
there could be an even a more
general situations where things

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.900
aren't so great.
 

00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.250
So what is the proof?
 

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:53.730
It's two lines.
 

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:59.596
If (X^(i)-hat,
Y^(i)-hat) is really better for

00:40:59.596 --> 00:41:05.594
i, then I claim--line one,
W^(i) of (X^(i)-hat,

00:41:05.594 --> 00:41:07.550
Y^(i)-hat).
 

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:10.679
Sorry, this is line zero.
 

00:41:10.679 --> 00:41:12.389
This is just repeating what's
the case.

00:41:12.389 --> 00:41:15.949
W^(i) of X^(i)-hat,
Y^(i)-hat greater than

00:41:15.949 --> 00:41:17.860
W^(i)(X^(i), Y^(i)).
 

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.639
That's for all i.
 

00:41:19.639 --> 00:41:21.030
That's the claim.
 

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:29.599
Could this happen that you've
got a feasible (X^(i)-hat,

00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:33.025
Y^(i)-hat) and it makes
everybody better off than

00:41:33.025 --> 00:41:34.239
(X^(i), Y^(i)).
 

00:41:34.239 --> 00:41:34.809
Could this happen?
 

00:41:34.809 --> 00:41:35.889
The answer's no.
 

00:41:35.889 --> 00:41:39.760
Line one is,
if that were true then it would

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:44.530
have to be the case that
P_X times X^(i)-hat

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:49.119
P_Y times Y^(i)-hat
had to be greater than

00:41:49.119 --> 00:41:53.619
P_X times
E^(i)_X P_Y

00:41:53.619 --> 00:41:56.500
times E^(i)_Y.
 

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:57.539
Why is that?
 

00:41:57.539 --> 00:42:00.230
Because the budget set of Mr.
 

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:05.983
i says he spends all his money
on X and Y in his budget set and

00:42:05.983 --> 00:42:08.210
does the best he can.
 

00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:11.840
(X^(i), Y^(i)) solves this
problem.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.346
So if this thing really makes
him better off than what he

00:42:15.346 --> 00:42:19.103
chose, it can't be that it was
affordable--otherwise he would

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:20.920
have bought this instead.
 

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.619
So it has to be that for i,
this bundle cost more than he

00:42:24.619 --> 00:42:25.480
can afford.
 

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.090
That's why he didn't choose it.
 

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:33.409
So this relies on agent
rationality.

00:42:33.409 --> 00:42:37.559
Everybody given his choices,
he doesn't care about the rest

00:42:37.559 --> 00:42:39.920
of the world,
but given his choice

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:43.070
everybody's doing the best thing
he can.

00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.500
Shiller would say,
"People make mistakes.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.090
They're crazy.
 

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.219
They have no idea what they're
doing.

00:42:47.219 --> 00:42:48.000
They're stupid.
 

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.858
Some guy tells them a story in
the bar one night and they

00:42:51.858 --> 00:42:54.478
totally change their life
around,"

00:42:54.478 --> 00:42:56.960
so he'd say all this isn't
true.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.090
All right, but anyway I
actually believe that people

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:03.775
have more sense about deciding
for themselves what's good for

00:43:03.775 --> 00:43:07.889
them than third parties do about
deciding what's good for them.

00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:10.210
So I don't want to challenge
this.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:13.329
So if you don't challenge this
you conclude that if something

00:43:13.329 --> 00:43:16.346
makes everybody better off each
person must have found this

00:43:16.346 --> 00:43:19.101
allocation unaffordable
otherwise he would have chosen

00:43:19.101 --> 00:43:19.570
it.
 

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.380
[Audio dropped]
over i of E^(i)_Y.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.659
So all I did was--that's true
for every single person i.

00:43:25.659 --> 00:43:28.090
So I could add this inequality
for i,

00:43:28.090 --> 00:43:31.690
plus this inequality for j,
plus this inequality for all

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:35.681
the people and then I use the
distributive law to take the sum

00:43:35.681 --> 00:43:37.449
inside and I have this.
 

00:43:37.449 --> 00:43:42.349
But that is impossible and
that's the end of the proof

00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:47.619
because the sum of this
X^(i)-hat is equal to this sum.

00:43:47.619 --> 00:43:49.268
That was what we had supposed.
 

00:43:49.268 --> 00:43:53.744
You're just rearranging all the
goods that are really there and

00:43:53.744 --> 00:43:56.268
this sum is the same as this
sum.

00:43:56.268 --> 00:43:59.601
So therefore since the new
allocation just rearranges the

00:43:59.601 --> 00:44:02.340
endowment differently from the
equilibrium,

00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.518
and rearranges the X's maybe
differently from the

00:44:04.518 --> 00:44:06.429
equilibrium,
it has to be that actually this

00:44:06.429 --> 00:44:08.610
thing on the left is equal to
this thing on the right.

00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:11.210
It's identical to it so it
can't be greater and that's the

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.940
contradiction.
 

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:13.389
That's the end of the proof.
 

00:44:13.389 --> 00:44:18.826
So it's two lines,
two lines to prove what Adam

00:44:18.826 --> 00:44:25.797
Smith spent 400 pages arguing
that the free market is a good

00:44:25.797 --> 00:44:26.980
thing.
 

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.833
So this is the basis for the
idea that we shouldn't regulate,

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:32.070
we shouldn't regulate,
we shouldn't regulate.

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:35.630
Sounds pretty convincing,
so any questions about this?

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.840
Anything you'd like to say?
 

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:45.960
Are you convinced by this?
 

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:50.465
What are some reasons you don't
believe this,

00:44:50.465 --> 00:44:52.820
some obvious reasons?
 

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:53.840
Yes?
 

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.835
Student: Well,
even if this proof makes sense

00:44:56.835 --> 00:45:00.126
a lot of regulation policies
have to do with changing the

00:45:00.126 --> 00:45:02.887
prices of things anyway so we're
not necessarily

00:45:02.887 --> 00:45:04.710
&gt;
 

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:08.280
with them at market
&gt;

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:11.606
Prof: I'm glad you asked
that question because it betrays

00:45:11.606 --> 00:45:13.983
a misunderstanding,
so I'm glad you asked that

00:45:13.983 --> 00:45:14.670
question.
 

00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:22.400
So this theorem is correct
given the assumptions.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:28.079
There's a little bit mistake in
the reasoning he made.

00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:30.284
I want to repeat his question,
change it a little bit so maybe

00:45:30.284 --> 00:45:31.909
he'll deny what this is what he
was saying.

00:45:31.909 --> 00:45:35.271
But I believe what he just said
is what really happens in a lot

00:45:35.271 --> 00:45:38.469
of regulation is they come in
and they change the prices.

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:40.717
They tax a good,
they prevent people from

00:45:40.717 --> 00:45:42.909
trading so much so the price
changes.

00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:44.340
They subsidize something.
 

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:46.661
Something happens so that you
get different prices,

00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:48.889
and of course at those
different prices you get a

00:45:48.889 --> 00:45:50.050
different allocation.
 

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:52.690
That's all true so far.
 

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:56.110
And then he said because
they're at different prices you

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:59.530
can't compare the original
equilibrium allocation to the

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.460
new equilibrium allocation.
 

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:05.329
Well, that's where he
shortchanged this proof,

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:10.159
this proof says however you get
to a new allocation (X^(i)-hat,

00:46:10.159 --> 00:46:12.534
Y^(i)-hat), maybe it's because
the government has intervened

00:46:12.534 --> 00:46:15.030
and changed all the prices and
done a bunch of other stuff,

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.909
but in the end after all that
intervention the government is

00:46:17.909 --> 00:46:20.400
going to get you to a new
allocation (X^(i)-hat,

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:24.465
Y^(i)-hat), and that new
allocation can't be better than

00:46:24.465 --> 00:46:25.869
the original one.
 

00:46:25.869 --> 00:46:29.400
So that's the force of the
argument.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:32.717
No matter what the government
does in the end the upshot is a

00:46:32.717 --> 00:46:34.929
new allocation (X^(i)-hat,
Y^(i)-hat).

00:46:34.929 --> 00:46:36.159
We don't have to think about
[how]

00:46:36.159 --> 00:46:36.719
it got there.
 

00:46:36.719 --> 00:46:39.608
That's where it got and
according to this argument it

00:46:39.608 --> 00:46:40.610
can't be better.
 

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:43.599
So the argument is correct and
elegant.

00:46:43.599 --> 00:46:45.326
There must be something missing
to the argument,

00:46:45.326 --> 00:46:47.382
some assumption you don't
really believe if you doubt the

00:46:47.382 --> 00:46:47.860
argument.
 

00:46:47.860 --> 00:46:49.070
Yes?
 

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:52.981
Student: What if you
want an allocation that's better

00:46:52.981 --> 00:46:56.630
for one party even at the
expense of the other party?

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:58.559
Prof: What if you want
an allocation?

00:46:58.559 --> 00:47:01.853
Student: It's socially
desirable to have an allocation

00:47:01.853 --> 00:47:05.311
that's better for one party even
if that comes at the expense of

00:47:05.311 --> 00:47:06.300
another party.
 

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:10.757
Prof: So one argument
you could say is that it may be

00:47:10.757 --> 00:47:14.840
in the equilibrium that A--so
who's better off here?

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.242
You notice that this
equilibrium A ends up with more

00:47:18.242 --> 00:47:20.110
of everything than B does.
 

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:22.965
So you could say this
equilibrium is not very socially

00:47:22.965 --> 00:47:26.307
desirable because A ends up with
more of everything than B does

00:47:26.307 --> 00:47:28.949
or at least as much of
everything as B does,

00:47:28.949 --> 00:47:31.677
and that seems unjust and
unfair and so we don't like the

00:47:31.677 --> 00:47:34.168
allocation,
and so maybe we should move

00:47:34.168 --> 00:47:35.710
something from A to B.
 

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.320
So that's an argument on the
basis of justice.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.617
It says we can find juster
allocations that are somehow

00:47:41.617 --> 00:47:44.731
socially more desirable,
but this argument of Pareto

00:47:44.731 --> 00:47:46.869
Efficiency is about efficiency.
 

00:47:46.869 --> 00:47:51.974
Maybe you could hurt A to help
B because that serves your

00:47:51.974 --> 00:47:56.440
desire for fairness,
but that doesn't say anything

00:47:56.440 --> 00:48:00.268
about how efficient the
allocation is.

00:48:00.268 --> 00:48:02.518
It's still true that the
original allocation was

00:48:02.518 --> 00:48:05.440
efficient in the sense you
couldn't make anyone better off.

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.545
So the economists would say in
order to hurt A and help B what

00:48:08.545 --> 00:48:11.599
you should do is take some of
A's endowment away from him and

00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:14.552
give it to her and then let them
trade to a new competitive

00:48:14.552 --> 00:48:17.250
equilibrium where she began with
more than him.

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:20.655
And so the just thing to do is
to rearrange the resources at

00:48:20.655 --> 00:48:23.543
the beginning and still let
people trade to a final

00:48:23.543 --> 00:48:24.409
allocation.
 

00:48:24.409 --> 00:48:27.719
So that's an argument from
fairness, but it doesn't

00:48:27.719 --> 00:48:31.891
interfere, it doesn't contradict
the economic argument that fair

00:48:31.891 --> 00:48:34.210
or unfair it's still efficient.
 

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.827
We've done as well as we could
making everyone as happy as we

00:48:36.827 --> 00:48:37.090
can.
 

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.786
Maybe we can hurt someone and
help someone else but we can't

00:48:39.786 --> 00:48:42.779
help everyone at the same time,
whereas most regulation the

00:48:42.779 --> 00:48:46.030
argument in favor of regulation
is you're helping everybody by

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:48.043
regulating,
and this says you can't ever do

00:48:48.043 --> 00:48:48.280
that.
 

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.070
So what's missing?
 

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:49.880
What's some of the assumptions?
 

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:52.000
This should be an elementary
question for you.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.059
Yes?
 

00:48:53.059 --> 00:48:55.983
Student: Is it violating
one of the three assumptions

00:48:55.983 --> 00:48:57.469
that &gt;
 

00:48:57.469 --> 00:48:58.610
, the market theory?
 

00:48:58.610 --> 00:49:00.648
Prof: No,
it's got all those assumptions

00:49:00.648 --> 00:49:03.396
so there's something about the
model that's too narrow and this

00:49:03.396 --> 00:49:04.239
should be easy.
 

00:49:04.239 --> 00:49:07.405
You're going to tell me obvious
things where it's too narrow,

00:49:07.405 --> 00:49:09.780
so I'm going to just say where
we're going.

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:12.527
You're supposed to be telling
me now obvious ways this is too

00:49:12.527 --> 00:49:12.940
narrow.
 

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:14.117
I'm going to say,
"You're right.

00:49:14.117 --> 00:49:14.543
You're right.
 

00:49:14.543 --> 00:49:15.920
You're right,
but finance is different.

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.519
We don't have to worry about
those problems supposedly."

00:49:18.519 --> 00:49:21.280
So go ahead back there, you.
 

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.429
Student: Externalities.
 

00:49:22.429 --> 00:49:25.884
Prof: So one critical
shortcoming of this argument is

00:49:25.884 --> 00:49:27.699
that there are externalities.
 

00:49:27.699 --> 00:49:35.288
Suppose that X is cigarettes,
and A buying and smoking more

00:49:35.288 --> 00:49:38.690
cigarettes makes B sick.
 

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.199
So that's not part of this.
 

00:49:40.199 --> 00:49:41.340
Why is that not part of this?
 

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:44.688
Because B's utility depends
only on what B's consuming,

00:49:44.688 --> 00:49:45.989
not what A's doing.
 

00:49:45.989 --> 00:49:49.059
So there's no place in this
model.

00:49:49.059 --> 00:49:51.590
It's too narrow to include
externalities,

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:55.659
so it doesn't capture the fact
that he,

00:49:55.659 --> 00:49:58.744
by smoking, might make her sick
by smoking so many cigarettes

00:49:58.744 --> 00:50:00.030
and that's not in here.
 

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.771
And if you put the idea that
B's utility, her utility might

00:50:03.771 --> 00:50:07.708
depend on what he's doing and
not what she's doing the theorem

00:50:07.708 --> 00:50:08.869
won't be true.
 

00:50:08.869 --> 00:50:11.949
So there's a reason to tax
pollution, and to tax cigarettes

00:50:11.949 --> 00:50:14.500
and all those things because of
externalities.

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.889
So that's a fundamental problem.
 

00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:18.670
Yes?
 

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.677
Student: It's also
assuming that all of our

00:50:20.677 --> 00:50:22.809
indifference curves are aligned
in the same shape.

00:50:22.809 --> 00:50:24.759
Prof: Well,
we're assuming diminishing

00:50:24.759 --> 00:50:26.885
marginal utility,
but each person has a different

00:50:26.885 --> 00:50:28.260
indifference curve,
so yes.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.210
We assume that they are all
curved away from the origin,

00:50:31.210 --> 00:50:33.570
so we assume diminishing
marginal utility.

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:36.112
But I think that I'm almost
prepared to believe,

00:50:36.112 --> 00:50:37.789
diminishing marginal utility.
 

00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:39.690
It's not literally true.
 

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:46.251
Moving from one ticket to two
tickets may be a huge gain in

00:50:46.251 --> 00:50:52.360
utility because now you can
bring your friend along.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.900
Getting one ticket might not be
worth much because you don't

00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:55.719
want to go alone.
 

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:58.159
Getting the second one may add
a huge amount of utility.

00:50:58.159 --> 00:51:00.625
That's an increasing marginal
utility, but eventually after

00:51:00.625 --> 00:51:03.260
you've got enough tickets it's
going to be diminishing marginal

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:03.768
utility.
 

00:51:03.768 --> 00:51:06.670
So I believe on the whole that
diminishing marginal utility is

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:09.434
not such a bad assumption,
but this clearly relies on

00:51:09.434 --> 00:51:12.523
that, so you're right but I
don't think that's the critical

00:51:12.523 --> 00:51:13.110
problem.
 

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:13.820
What else is there?
 

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:14.550
Yes?
 

00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:15.670
Student: Credit markets.
 

00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:16.170
Prof: What?
 

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.090
Student: Credit.
 

00:51:17.090 --> 00:51:19.181
Prof: Credit markets,
now we're starting to talk a

00:51:19.181 --> 00:51:21.199
little bit about finance,
so just hold that thought for

00:51:21.199 --> 00:51:21.760
one second.
 

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:26.248
Anything else you can think of
besides externalities that's

00:51:26.248 --> 00:51:29.809
terrible for--so let me
transition this way.

00:51:29.809 --> 00:51:32.409
So of course people notice
externalities.

00:51:32.409 --> 00:51:35.940
Another kind of regulation is
perfect competition.

00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:38.079
We assumed everyone took the
prices as given.

00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:41.514
There was no monopolist setting
the price and refusing to

00:51:41.514 --> 00:51:44.090
bargain with people and stuff
like that.

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:47.402
So regulation could come about
in order to enforce the

00:51:47.402 --> 00:51:50.902
competitive equilibrium to allow
for perfect competition,

00:51:50.902 --> 00:51:52.840
so we assumed that already.
 

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.235
That's one place for
regulation, and a second place

00:51:55.235 --> 00:51:56.960
is because of these
externalities.

00:51:56.960 --> 00:52:00.771
So for 50 to 100 years
everybody has accepted those two

00:52:00.771 --> 00:52:01.619
arguments.
 

00:52:01.619 --> 00:52:04.793
Clearly there's a place for
regulating free markets,

00:52:04.793 --> 00:52:08.280
ensuring free markets and
stopping trusts and monopolies,

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:10.460
and for stopping externalities.
 

00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:15.340
But then people said finance is
different.

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:17.820
There aren't any externalities.
 

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:19.690
You're just trading stocks and
bonds.

00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:20.699
There's no pollution.
 

00:52:20.699 --> 00:52:23.003
Nobody's going to get sick
because someone else has a stock

00:52:23.003 --> 00:52:23.480
or a bond.
 

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.773
Some people might be jealous
but we're not really going to

00:52:25.773 --> 00:52:26.780
take that into account.
 

00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:30.190
We don't want to honor those
kinds of feelings of jealousy.

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:32.317
So the argument seemed to be
when you get to finance you

00:52:32.317 --> 00:52:33.980
don't have to worry about
externalities,

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:36.766
and yes you have to worry about
perfect competition but once

00:52:36.766 --> 00:52:39.650
you've got perfect competition
that's the end of the story.

00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:42.159
So the rest of the course now
is going to be,

00:52:42.159 --> 00:52:45.838
if you forget about
externalities because you forget

00:52:45.838 --> 00:52:49.949
about pollution because we're
trading pieces of paper,

00:52:49.949 --> 00:52:54.088
they're not polluting anything,
why shouldn't the financial

00:52:54.088 --> 00:52:55.730
markets be efficient?
 

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:58.454
Why doesn't this argument apply
to the financial markets,

00:52:58.454 --> 00:53:01.083
and one of the critical
financial markets is the credit

00:53:01.083 --> 00:53:01.619
market.
 

00:53:01.619 --> 00:53:04.585
So can you understand the
credit market on just these

00:53:04.585 --> 00:53:07.780
terms and therefore argue that
the market's efficient?

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:10.588
So we're going to spend a large
part of the course talking about

00:53:10.588 --> 00:53:10.900
that.
 

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:14.063
So unless you had some
particular point to raise now,

00:53:14.063 --> 00:53:17.469
I'm going to just use your
comment as a good introduction

00:53:17.469 --> 00:53:19.599
to the next part of the course.
 

00:53:19.599 --> 00:53:24.077
So far there's nothing that
seems to directly involve

00:53:24.077 --> 00:53:27.780
finance in what we've been
talking about.

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.949
So where does the finance come
in?

00:53:29.949 --> 00:53:33.797
So Irving Fisher was the person
who created the first really

00:53:33.797 --> 00:53:36.340
general equilibrium model of
finance.

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:39.530
So he was a Yale undergraduate.
 

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.179
He was a superstar Yale
undergraduate.

00:53:42.179 --> 00:53:47.530
He graduated first in his class
from Yale.

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:49.809
He was a math major.
 

00:53:49.809 --> 00:53:54.447
He decided that he wanted to
build a financial equilibrium

00:53:54.447 --> 00:53:55.099
model.
 

00:53:55.099 --> 00:53:57.210
There were no economists there
at his time.

00:53:57.210 --> 00:53:59.297
We're talking,
in the late 1800s,

00:53:59.297 --> 00:54:02.177
and so he went to Gibbs,
the famous physicist,

00:54:02.177 --> 00:54:05.530
one of America's most famous
physicists at the time and said,

00:54:05.530 --> 00:54:11.320
"Can you advise an
economics PhD?"

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:12.675
And Gibbs said,
"Well, if it's

00:54:12.675 --> 00:54:14.632
mathematical enough,
it has a model and something,

00:54:14.632 --> 00:54:15.670
yes I can do it."
 

00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:18.605
And so Fisher's PhD
dissertation was basically

00:54:18.605 --> 00:54:22.257
reinventing this general
equilibrium model that I've just

00:54:22.257 --> 00:54:26.105
described and then making a
machine to calculate equilibrium

00:54:26.105 --> 00:54:29.692
with water and pumps and water
seeking its own level and

00:54:29.692 --> 00:54:31.780
solving for equilibrium.
 

00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:37.108
And we had this machine up
until the 1970s in the Cowles

00:54:37.108 --> 00:54:40.210
Foundation when it got stolen.
 

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:44.655
Some engineer named Sreenivasan
about ten years ago was ready to

00:54:44.655 --> 00:54:47.067
rebuild the machine--
because we have the

00:54:47.067 --> 00:54:49.596
dissertation where it explains
very carefully how Fisher built

00:54:49.596 --> 00:54:51.909
his machine,
and he was going to rebuild it.

00:54:51.909 --> 00:54:55.809
And then he was offered
ElBaradei's job.

00:54:55.809 --> 00:54:58.693
ElBaradei is the guy,
the nuclear inspector who goes

00:54:58.693 --> 00:55:01.463
to Iraq and says they're
building nuclear stuff or

00:55:01.463 --> 00:55:03.159
they're not building this.
 

00:55:03.159 --> 00:55:06.172
Anyway, so he was offered that
job, and so he left Yale and

00:55:06.172 --> 00:55:08.510
then decided not to take the job
after all.

00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:10.780
So we've still got ElBaradei in
the job.

00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:13.929
But anyway, he left Yale and so
we never got the machine built.

00:55:13.929 --> 00:55:14.820
He was a great guy.
 

00:55:14.820 --> 00:55:20.978
Anyway, so Fisher after writing
his dissertation stayed at Yale

00:55:20.978 --> 00:55:25.550
as an assistant professor and he
got tenure.

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:28.195
He became the most famous
economist probably in the

00:55:28.195 --> 00:55:29.360
country for a while.
 

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:35.230
He invented finance,
as I'm about to tell you,

00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:38.846
and in a way this model of
finance I'm about to present

00:55:38.846 --> 00:55:42.864
which was in retrospect clearly
the most interesting model of

00:55:42.864 --> 00:55:46.320
finance of its time,
and he was a financial

00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.210
economist.
 

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:50.963
He also was an entrepreneur,
so you'll see later that he

00:55:50.963 --> 00:55:52.739
started his own company.
 

00:55:52.739 --> 00:55:57.304
It was a proto-computer company
called Remington and he managed

00:55:57.304 --> 00:56:02.090
to make $10 million dollars for
his company in the early 1900s.

00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:05.840
And he was a friend of
Roosevelt's and he kept advising

00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.590
Roosevelt during the Depression
to print more money.

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:10.409
He said, "Print more money.
 

00:56:10.409 --> 00:56:10.869
Print more money.
 

00:56:10.869 --> 00:56:12.746
Print more money,"
and the Yale Library has all

00:56:12.746 --> 00:56:14.110
these letters he sent to
Roosevelt.

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:16.764
It also has Roosevelt's
responses where you can tell

00:56:16.764 --> 00:56:19.054
that Roosevelt is paying no
attention to him,

00:56:19.054 --> 00:56:21.190
but Fisher's ego seemed to be
so big.

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:23.469
Roosevelt says,
"I'm very glad that the

00:56:23.469 --> 00:56:26.648
good professor has made such
worthy recommendations and we'll

00:56:26.648 --> 00:56:28.768
certainly take them
seriously."

00:56:28.768 --> 00:56:30.826
And then Fisher writes back and
says, "I'm glad you're

00:56:30.826 --> 00:56:32.280
going to follow what I
suggested."

00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.972
So anyway, Fisher,
convinced that the economy was

00:56:35.972 --> 00:56:39.894
going to turn around,
poured all his money into this

00:56:39.894 --> 00:56:42.280
computer company Remington.
 

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.233
The company in the great stock
market crash nearly went

00:56:45.233 --> 00:56:46.820
bankrupt and was leveraged.
 

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:51.449
So he had to go to his wife who
was very wealthy and borrow her

00:56:51.449 --> 00:56:53.989
money, and they lost that money.
 

00:56:53.989 --> 00:56:56.840
Then he went to her parents and
borrowed all their money and

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.710
lost that money.
 

00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:59.829
And finally he had lost
everything of his money,

00:56:59.829 --> 00:57:01.985
his wife's money and his wife's
parents' money and they were

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.300
about to take his house from
him,

00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:05.762
foreclose on his house,
and so Yale was forced to buy

00:57:05.762 --> 00:57:08.130
his house for him so he could
continue to teach.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:12.398
So he set a bad precedent for
economists at Yale because

00:57:12.398 --> 00:57:17.289
whenever any economist at Yale
has financial advice to give,

00:57:17.289 --> 00:57:20.902
someone always quotes Irving
Fisher's 1929 line that the

00:57:20.902 --> 00:57:24.119
economy had reached a
permanently high plateau.

00:57:24.119 --> 00:57:29.686
But anyway, despite all that
his theories are well worth

00:57:29.686 --> 00:57:30.800
studying.
 

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.900
He was famous for a few other
things.

00:57:32.900 --> 00:57:36.380
Shiller is clearly trying to
imitate Fisher.

00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:39.697
Fisher wrote a huge number of
books, 50 books about

00:57:39.697 --> 00:57:40.559
everything.
 

00:57:40.559 --> 00:57:43.733
So he got tuberculosis and he
survived and he wrote a series

00:57:43.733 --> 00:57:46.744
of books on good living and good
health and how to combat

00:57:46.744 --> 00:57:47.659
tuberculosis.
 

00:57:47.659 --> 00:57:50.664
So he said you had to exercise,
you had to get fresh air,

00:57:50.664 --> 00:57:52.489
and these were huge
bestsellers.

00:57:52.489 --> 00:57:57.530
Then he said that drinking was
a terrible thing.

00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:00.550
So he did an experiment in
class where he would have his

00:58:00.550 --> 00:58:03.021
students do pushups,
then he'd give them all a

00:58:03.021 --> 00:58:03.679
martini.
 

00:58:03.679 --> 00:58:05.530
Then he'd count how many
pushups they could do.

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:07.565
Then he'd give them a second
martini and count how many

00:58:07.565 --> 00:58:08.469
pushups they could do.
 

00:58:08.469 --> 00:58:13.659
And he found that there was a
10% reduction for each martini.

00:58:13.659 --> 00:58:16.802
And so he said that
prohibition--since the average

00:58:16.802 --> 00:58:20.777
business person had two drinks
at lunch--that prohibition would

00:58:20.777 --> 00:58:22.510
increase output by 20%.
 

00:58:22.510 --> 00:58:27.909
And so he was one of the
leading proponents of

00:58:27.909 --> 00:58:29.590
prohibition.
 

00:58:29.590 --> 00:58:34.686
So after the stock market crash
he helped form the Cowles

00:58:34.686 --> 00:58:35.869
Foundation.
 

00:58:35.869 --> 00:58:40.978
So Cowles, who was a Yale
undergraduate,

00:58:40.978 --> 00:58:47.920
had run a very famous macro
forecasting company in the

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.230
1920s.
 

00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:52.230
And in 1929 the stock market
crashed.

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:53.639
There were a whole series of
these.

00:58:53.639 --> 00:58:54.659
They sent newsletters.
 

00:58:54.659 --> 00:58:56.699
The same kind of stuff they do
now.

00:58:56.699 --> 00:58:59.826
He, unlike all the others,
after the fact realized that he

00:58:59.826 --> 00:59:02.184
hadn't anticipated anything
about the crash,

00:59:02.184 --> 00:59:04.380
much like nobody anticipated it
now.

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:06.960
And he was so embarrassed he
went and collected,

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.469
not only his old
recommendations themselves,

00:59:09.469 --> 00:59:12.452
but all his competitors' and so
he published a famous paper in

00:59:12.452 --> 00:59:15.239
which he argued that economists
had no idea what they were

00:59:15.239 --> 00:59:17.469
talking about,
in fact that they were frauds.

00:59:17.469 --> 00:59:20.500
And so he went to his old
economist Irving Fisher at Yale

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.909
and said,
"Look, I just believe that

00:59:22.909 --> 00:59:25.518
economics without mathematics
has no meaning.

00:59:25.518 --> 00:59:29.672
I want to start a mathematical
wing of economics and I've got a

00:59:29.672 --> 00:59:31.079
lot of money."
 

00:59:31.079 --> 00:59:33.990
His family owned The
Chicago Tribune and

00:59:33.990 --> 00:59:37.208
The Seattle Times and a
whole bunch of other newspapers

00:59:37.208 --> 00:59:40.070
and there was a famous fashion
model in the family,

00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:41.550
Fleur Cowles and stuff like
that.

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:45.137
So anyway, so with Cowles'
money Fisher started the

00:59:45.137 --> 00:59:49.728
Econometric Society which is the
most famous mathematical society

00:59:49.728 --> 00:59:52.340
in economics,
Econometrica,

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:55.219
which is the most famous
journal in economics,

00:59:55.219 --> 00:59:58.666
and the Cowles Foundation
which--they started off in

00:59:58.666 --> 01:00:01.369
Colorado Springs because Fisher
said,

01:00:01.369 --> 01:00:03.536
"Oh, the weather's so good
there everyone will want to go

01:00:03.536 --> 01:00:04.849
there and it's good for
them."

01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:08.460
So nobody would go there so
they had to move it to Chicago

01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:12.326
where the Tribune was
and it was in Chicago from 1930

01:00:12.326 --> 01:00:15.637
to 1955,
and then in 1955 it moved to

01:00:15.637 --> 01:00:16.170
Yale.
 

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:18.699
And since then the Cowles
Foundation has been at Yale,

01:00:18.699 --> 01:00:20.800
and you'll hear a lot more
about it later.

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:23.083
But anyway, so Cowles
[correction: Fisher]

01:00:23.083 --> 01:00:26.204
with that background he set out
to figure out how to turn

01:00:26.204 --> 01:00:28.643
economics--
in fact he invented economics,

01:00:28.643 --> 01:00:31.050
this model of equilibrium to
study finance,

01:00:31.050 --> 01:00:33.469
but so far we don't have any
finance in the model.

01:00:33.469 --> 01:00:35.269
So how can you put it in?
 

01:00:35.269 --> 01:00:36.619
Well, what is missing?
 

01:00:36.619 --> 01:00:41.268
What do I need to put in the
model in order to turn it into

01:00:41.268 --> 01:00:42.070
finance?
 

01:00:42.070 --> 01:00:43.268
What would you say is missing?
 

01:00:43.268 --> 01:00:47.409
How would you turn this into
finance?

01:00:47.409 --> 01:00:48.510
What other key thing--yes?
 

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:51.289
Student: You need some
element of time.

01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:54.996
Prof: So the first
thing--of course you may have

01:00:54.996 --> 01:00:58.704
read ahead in the notes,
but that's a brilliant insight

01:00:58.704 --> 01:00:59.940
if it's yours.
 

01:00:59.940 --> 01:01:06.949
You need time in the model.
 

01:01:06.949 --> 01:01:10.481
So far we just had apples and
oranges or something being

01:01:10.481 --> 01:01:11.059
traded.
 

01:01:11.059 --> 01:01:14.827
So the first thing is Fisher
said you need to put time in the

01:01:14.827 --> 01:01:15.329
model.
 

01:01:15.329 --> 01:01:18.635
What else is critically missing
in this model,

01:01:18.635 --> 01:01:21.650
one other thing,
the major other thing?

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:22.280
Yeah?
 

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:23.380
Student: Risk.
 

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:23.949
Prof: What?
 

01:01:23.949 --> 01:01:24.570
Student: Risk.
 

01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:25.579
Prof: Well, that's good.
 

01:01:25.579 --> 01:01:26.949
There's risk.
 

01:01:26.949 --> 01:01:29.010
That's missing entirely.
 

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:32.599
So Fisher actually couldn't
figure out how to put that in

01:01:32.599 --> 01:01:35.420
the model, but we're going to
get to that.

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.349
That's very good.
 

01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:38.889
What else is missing?
 

01:01:38.889 --> 01:01:39.619
Yeah?
 

01:01:39.619 --> 01:01:44.579
Student: Impatience.
 

01:01:44.579 --> 01:01:46.740
Prof: Fisher,
you'll see, had something to

01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:49.307
say about time and impatience
that people always care more

01:01:49.307 --> 01:01:51.018
about the present than the
future.

01:01:51.018 --> 01:01:53.963
But what other fundamental
thing about--what is finance all

01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:54.369
about?
 

01:01:54.369 --> 01:01:56.380
When you think about finance
what do you think about?

01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:00.190
Student: Savings or
credit rates.

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:05.525
Prof: So you think about
credit, as she said,

01:02:05.525 --> 01:02:09.710
credit, interest rates,
and what else?

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:10.400
Student: Return.
 

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.409
Prof: Return,
that's quite related to that.

01:02:14.409 --> 01:02:16.577
So all this has to go in the
model, but what fundamental

01:02:16.577 --> 01:02:18.983
object when you think--the first
thing you think about finance

01:02:18.983 --> 01:02:19.969
what do you think of?
 

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:20.880
Yes?
 

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.679
Student: Money.
 

01:02:21.679 --> 01:02:24.574
Prof: Money,
so that's not what I had in

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:27.280
mind, but I'm glad you think
about money.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.280
He's right.
 

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.909
That is what most people think
about, so money.

01:02:30.909 --> 01:02:33.650
So in this course we're not
going to provide a theory of

01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:34.050
money.
 

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:37.588
So Fisher did provide this
theory of money and that's what

01:02:37.588 --> 01:02:40.630
he was talking to Roosevelt
about all the time.

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:43.190
We're going to talk about
inflation and stuff like that,

01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:46.170
but we're not going to explain
where the inflation comes from.

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:49.157
So inflation is going to very
important, but we're not going

01:02:49.157 --> 01:02:50.880
to talk about a theory of money.
 

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.030
So what else is missing,
something really basic though?

01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:54.559
Yes?
 

01:02:54.559 --> 01:02:57.639
Student: Institutions.
 

01:02:57.639 --> 01:03:03.972
Prof: So there are no
banks and things like that,

01:03:03.972 --> 01:03:05.699
institutions.
 

01:03:05.699 --> 01:03:07.420
And still something.
 

01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.440
Come on what's the...
 

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.099
Student: Loaning.
 

01:03:10.099 --> 01:03:11.719
Prof: What?
 

01:03:11.719 --> 01:03:12.750
Student: Loaning funds.
 

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:14.860
Prof: Loaning funds,
well somebody said credit.

01:03:14.860 --> 01:03:17.530
That's sort of loaning funds
and interest rates.

01:03:17.530 --> 01:03:18.550
Student: Collateral.
 

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:20.079
Prof: Collateral,
that's something.

01:03:20.079 --> 01:03:21.800
I'm going to add that.
 

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:22.369
Thank you.
 

01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:23.940
What a brilliant idea.
 

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:28.190
What basic thing?
 

01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.690
Come on.
 

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:29.230
Yes?
 

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:30.159
Student: Wealth.
 

01:03:30.159 --> 01:03:31.500
Prof: Wealth,
that's in the model.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.309
Where's wealth?
 

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.559
It's already there.
 

01:03:33.559 --> 01:03:36.547
So when you take your endowment
and you multiply it by the

01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:39.010
prices in your budget set that's
your wealth.

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:40.960
So we've got wealth.
 

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.300
Student: Capital.
 

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:46.976
Prof: Capital,
so capital--and what is

01:03:46.976 --> 01:03:48.039
capital?
 

01:03:48.039 --> 01:03:49.050
What do you mean by capital?
 

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.474
If it's money,
I already told you that's not

01:03:51.474 --> 01:03:52.940
quite going to be there.
 

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.630
Student: Contract.
 

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:57.440
Prof: Contract,
so we're getting there.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.000
Student: Assets.
 

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.840
Prof: Assets,
so assets--that's the main

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:04.989
thing so I'm going to write it
over here, assets.

01:04:04.989 --> 01:04:09.829
After all finance is a lot
about the stock market,

01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:13.090
bond markets,
mortgage markets.

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:17.909
Those are all assets that you
buy that pay dividends later.

01:04:17.909 --> 01:04:21.110
So assets are things that pay
dividends at a later time.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:22.829
That's the critical thing
that's missing.

01:04:22.829 --> 01:04:24.733
And when we talk about finance
we want to know,

01:04:24.733 --> 01:04:26.679
what should the value of the
stock market be?

01:04:26.679 --> 01:04:31.500
How much should a mortgage be
worth?

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.329
So those are the things we have
to add.

01:04:33.329 --> 01:04:34.659
Now, how are we going to add
them?

01:04:34.659 --> 01:04:37.034
It sounds like you might have
to just totally redo the theory

01:04:37.034 --> 01:04:39.409
and start from scratch and do
something totally different.

01:04:39.409 --> 01:04:41.190
How horrible that would be.
 

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:43.510
It would mean I also wasted
three lectures.

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:46.817
So Fisher said,
"You don't really have to

01:04:46.817 --> 01:04:49.170
change very much at all."
 

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:51.699
So he said, "Number one,
time."

01:04:51.699 --> 01:04:53.789
How do you put time in the
model?

01:04:53.789 --> 01:05:14.389
Simply think of Y as the same
good as X but one period later.

01:05:14.389 --> 01:05:16.918
So Fisher said,
"Time isn't such a big

01:05:16.918 --> 01:05:17.340
deal.
 

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:18.679
We've already got two goods.
 

01:05:18.679 --> 01:05:23.510
These crazy marginalists before
me they had good X,

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:27.123
which was interesting,
and this very boring good Y and

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:31.418
so it's not so clear how you can
have time and everything in the

01:05:31.418 --> 01:05:33.085
model,
but I've already got two

01:05:33.085 --> 01:05:34.909
interesting goods,
X and Y.

01:05:34.909 --> 01:05:40.760
They're both entering with the
same symmetric properties.

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:43.567
Neither one of them seems more
interesting or more important

01:05:43.567 --> 01:05:45.802
than the other one,
so in fact maybe they're the

01:05:45.802 --> 01:05:46.469
same good.
 

01:05:46.469 --> 01:05:49.601
It's just--X and Y is the same
good, it's one comes one period

01:05:49.601 --> 01:05:50.320
later."
 

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.878
Now next class,
we're going to talk about

01:05:51.878 --> 01:05:53.789
you're not going to value them
the same amount.

01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:56.050
The utility for X and Y won't
be the same.

01:05:56.050 --> 01:05:59.500
So here A obviously thinks more
of X than he does of Y,

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:02.248
and by the way,
B, she also thinks more of X

01:06:02.248 --> 01:06:03.909
than she does about Y.
 

01:06:03.909 --> 01:06:05.309
So why is that?
 

01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:08.650
Well, if Y is the same as X but
a year later--people are

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:09.380
impatient.
 

01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:13.467
So the reason why A might like
X better than Y and B also is

01:06:13.467 --> 01:06:17.278
not because they're different
goods, but because they're

01:06:17.278 --> 01:06:18.250
impatient.
 

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:19.489
So we're going to come to that
later.

01:06:19.489 --> 01:06:24.644
So we can have the idea that
they're two different time

01:06:24.644 --> 01:06:30.181
periods in the economy simply by
change of notation and not

01:06:30.181 --> 01:06:33.619
introducing anything new at all.
 

01:06:33.619 --> 01:06:37.130
Well, what about assets?
 

01:06:37.130 --> 01:06:39.690
So I'm going to come back to
that in the next class.

01:06:39.690 --> 01:06:40.780
What about assets?
 

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:43.110
How can you introduce assets in
to the economy?

01:06:43.110 --> 01:06:45.981
Well, Fisher says,
"What is the essence of an

01:06:45.981 --> 01:06:46.449
asset?
 

01:06:46.449 --> 01:06:50.295
The essence of an asset is that
it's something that you hold

01:06:50.295 --> 01:06:54.335
today because later it's going
to deliver you money or goods or

01:06:54.335 --> 01:06:55.639
something."
 

01:06:55.639 --> 01:06:59.072
And we're not going to talk
about money so we're imagining

01:06:59.072 --> 01:07:00.760
these are all real assets.
 

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:03.820
So they're going to deliver
goods in the future.

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:07.668
So the definition of an asset
is an asset, remember,

01:07:07.668 --> 01:07:10.007
we have to make it
mathematical,

01:07:10.007 --> 01:07:14.989
so Fisher started this society
to make economics mathematical.

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:18.795
So an asset is literally
something that delivers goods in

01:07:18.795 --> 01:07:19.679
the future.
 

01:07:19.679 --> 01:07:30.385
So an asset is defined by its
payoffs, D_X and

01:07:30.385 --> 01:07:33.500
D_Y.
 

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:37.239
So we can call that asset
alpha, an asset alpha is defined

01:07:37.239 --> 01:07:39.338
by its payoffs,
D_X and

01:07:39.338 --> 01:07:40.518
D_Y.
 

01:07:40.518 --> 01:07:43.404
So it's going to pay a certain
amount of X and a certain amount

01:07:43.404 --> 01:07:43.730
of Y.
 

01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:45.239
That's all there is.
 

01:07:45.239 --> 01:07:48.248
Now, we're going to ask,
do people actually know what

01:07:48.248 --> 01:07:50.099
the payoff of Y's going to be?
 

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:52.320
If Y's in the future that means
it hasn't happened yet.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:55.119
Do we really know what Y's
going to be?

01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:59.592
And so maybe we know less about
one asset and more about another

01:07:59.592 --> 01:08:03.710
asset, so maybe one asset is
riskier than another asset.

01:08:03.710 --> 01:08:06.137
So someone said risk,
obviously that's going to be a

01:08:06.137 --> 01:08:07.469
very fundamental question.
 

01:08:07.469 --> 01:08:12.250
But before we come to risk,
if we don't have any risk yet,

01:08:12.250 --> 01:08:14.478
because Fisher didn't know how
to put it in and we're going to

01:08:14.478 --> 01:08:16.158
start with his model where
there's no risk,

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:19.488
then if there's just today and
tomorrow and everybody's

01:08:19.488 --> 01:08:21.440
rational,
everybody, since there's no

01:08:21.440 --> 01:08:23.533
uncertainty,
everybody wants to be able to

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:26.158
anticipate exactly what the
dividend's going to be.

01:08:26.158 --> 01:08:30.104
So the asset is no different
from what its dividend is going

01:08:30.104 --> 01:08:30.640
to be.
 

01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:33.872
Maybe it's paying something
today and also it's going to pay

01:08:33.872 --> 01:08:36.556
something tomorrow,
so assets are defined by their

01:08:36.556 --> 01:08:38.640
dividends, nothing more than
that.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:46.570
So the model now becomes a
model where we have the W^(I)

01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:52.340
and then we have the goods as
before,

01:08:52.340 --> 01:08:57.479
the endowments of the goods,
but we've added a new thing

01:08:57.479 --> 01:09:02.899
which is we've added the assets
D alpha X and D alpha Y.

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:06.488
So the alpha's over all the
assets, and we have to add

01:09:06.488 --> 01:09:10.010
everybody's ownership of the
assets to begin with.

01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:11.630
So we have to have theta.
 

01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:22.630
I'm going to call it theta bar
alpha, theta bar i alpha.

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:26.180
So how much of asset alpha does
i own?

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:30.649
So that's the economy that
we're going to start with.

01:09:30.649 --> 01:09:34.140
So we've made the model a bit
more complicated.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:39.649
We started where we did before
with utilities and endowments of

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:40.359
goods.
 

01:09:40.359 --> 01:09:43.136
Now we're adding assets which
payoff more goods,

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:46.268
and of course people begin
owning trees and stuff like

01:09:46.268 --> 01:09:46.800
that.
 

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.010
So a tree is an asset.
 

01:09:48.010 --> 01:09:52.265
It's going to pay apples later
on and various different people

01:09:52.265 --> 01:09:54.359
own various different trees.
 

01:09:54.359 --> 01:09:57.500
So to the old economy we add
something new.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:01.899
And now Fisher's ingenious
insight was that if you think

01:10:01.899 --> 01:10:04.524
about this,
which we will for a little

01:10:04.524 --> 01:10:07.648
while, you'll be able to
discover that you can simplify

01:10:07.648 --> 01:10:10.828
this economy back down to the
economy we began with.

01:10:10.828 --> 01:10:13.890
So you can start talking about
assets and interest and all

01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:17.060
kinds of others things using the
same analysis as before.

01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:22.617
So with my last thought here,
what does interest have to do

01:10:22.617 --> 01:10:26.448
with P_X over
P_Y?

01:10:26.448 --> 01:10:27.699
What is P_X over
P_Y?

01:10:27.699 --> 01:10:29.119
Suppose they're both apples.
 

01:10:29.119 --> 01:10:30.229
So X is an apple today.
 

01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:33.038
Y is an apple next year.
 

01:10:33.038 --> 01:10:34.760
What is P_X over
P_Y?

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.434
It says how much an apple is
worth today relative to how much

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:40.210
an apple is worth tomorrow.
 

01:10:40.210 --> 01:10:46.577
So this is going to turn out to
be 1 the real interest rate,

01:10:46.577 --> 01:10:49.060
Fisher would call it.
 

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.430
Because if P_X is
more than P_Y,

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:55.731
let's say P_X is 20%
more than P_Y what it

01:10:55.731 --> 01:10:59.893
means is by giving up one apple
today you can get 1.2 apples

01:10:59.893 --> 01:11:00.810
tomorrow.
 

01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:03.189
That's just what happens when
you put money in the bank.

01:11:03.189 --> 01:11:06.493
You give up something today you
get exactly the same thing back

01:11:06.493 --> 01:11:08.038
next period but more of it.
 

01:11:08.038 --> 01:11:11.238
So you see just by having time
and the prices like we had

01:11:11.238 --> 01:11:14.439
before you're going to see very
quickly how interest,

01:11:14.439 --> 01:11:17.613
assets, everything is going to
start coming into play very

01:11:17.613 --> 01:11:18.170
quickly.
 

01:11:18.170 --> 01:11:21.431
So I didn't put the problem set
on the web yet because I wasn't

01:11:21.431 --> 01:11:25.081
sure how far we'll get,
but I'll put it on in a couple

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:28.199
hours and we'll start again on
Thursday.

01:11:28.199 --> 01:11:33.000

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.240
Professor Robert Shiller:
Next Wednesday we're having

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.146
David Swensen lecture to us.
He heads up the Yale

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:14.985
endowment--or the investment of
the Yale endowment--and I have a

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:18.750
New York Times article on
the syllabus,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.210
just sort of a biography of him
you could read.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:30.152
On reserve, I have his recent
books, so I hope that you will

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:35.500
get a lot from him.
I misspoke, he's not a Yale

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.700
college graduate,
he's a Yale Economics PhD;

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.243
his undergraduate was from
University of Wisconsin but he's

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:48.765
been at Yale a very long time.
He came to Yale from Wall

00:00:48.765 --> 00:00:53.522
Street in 1985 and at that time
the Yale endowment was worth

00:00:53.522 --> 00:00:58.111
about one billion dollars.
It is now, under his

00:00:58.111 --> 00:01:04.303
leadership, $22.5 billion and
that explains a lot of the

00:01:04.303 --> 00:01:10.494
quality of your life because
that means we have about $2

00:01:10.494 --> 00:01:16.900
million dollars per student.
The interest on $2 million

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.936
dollars is--what is that?
I can't even do

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:25.968
division--$100,000 a year.
So that's why Yale is much more

00:01:25.968 --> 00:01:31.100
generous with financial aid than
other universities and why we

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.512
have beautiful--of course,
this room was built,

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:38.032
I believe, in the 30s.
Don't thank David Swensen for

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:41.430
this room but for a lot of other
things.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.979
So Yale had a 28% return on its
portfolio last year,

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.349
which was number one of all
college endowments.

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:56.129
Moreover, it's had a 17.8%
average return for the last ten

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:01.909
years, which is number one among
university endowments.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.481
We beat Harvard,
we beat Princeton,

00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:09.169
but actually Princeton was--the
head of the Princeton endowment

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.329
is a protégé
of David Swensen and I'm sure

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:16.430
these people get together and
talk.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.146
All of the major
universities--Harvard has been

00:02:19.146 --> 00:02:21.449
doing very well too and so have
Duke,

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:24.533
MIT, Amherst,
a lot of--it seems that

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:28.129
universities manage to invest
very well,

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.689
at least they have in recent
decades.

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:33.547
I think that has--my
theory--that has something to do

00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:36.349
with the intellectual atmosphere
at universities.

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.676
That is, investing well
requires careful study and the

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:47.605
intellectual tradition we have
at universities helps promote

00:02:47.605 --> 00:02:51.356
that.
I don't know if David Swensen

00:02:51.356 --> 00:02:55.749
can continue to do this.
I think we're--he's had a

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.008
spectacular return,
but he's getting into a

00:02:59.008 --> 00:03:02.635
challenging year.
This is a year of financial

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:07.479
crises, so I'm warning you ahead
that--don't expect a 28% return

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:10.940
on the Yale portfolio for the
coming year.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.986
You can ask him about that.
If he can do it again in this

00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:23.939
situation, it will be amazing.
That would be next Wednesday.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.750
Meanwhile, I want to talk today
about regulation.

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:38.978
Wow, I think we're
alright--something needs more

00:03:38.978 --> 00:03:45.850
regulation here--all these
wires.

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.759
I want to motivate regulation
in terms of the last lecture.

00:03:55.759 --> 00:04:01.091
Our previous lecture was about
behavioral finance and it was

00:04:01.091 --> 00:04:05.251
about human failings.
I think that we to motivate a

00:04:05.251 --> 00:04:09.126
lot of our regulation of
financial markets by the kinds

00:04:09.126 --> 00:04:14.816
of errors that people make.
I wanted to list a few errors

00:04:14.816 --> 00:04:22.622
that are well-known and that are
exploited by unscrupulous people

00:04:22.622 --> 00:04:26.668
in finance.
I think they motivate a lot of

00:04:26.668 --> 00:04:30.488
what--I'm going to write a
number of principles of

00:04:30.488 --> 00:04:35.243
behavioral finance down and just
mention them briefly and then

00:04:35.243 --> 00:04:43.443
return to regulation.
These are things from the field

00:04:43.443 --> 00:04:51.490
of psychology.
Wishful thinking.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.373
This refers to the fact that
people--this sounds like

00:04:54.373 --> 00:04:57.755
something you probably already
know but it has been documented

00:04:57.755 --> 00:05:00.865
by psychologists.
People tend to make the error

00:05:00.865 --> 00:05:03.550
of believing what they want to
believe.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.240
For example,
people tend to believe that

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.703
their team will win;
this has been documented by

00:05:13.703 --> 00:05:15.920
psychologists.
They have a bias.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.659
If you ask them,
what's the probability that

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:21.079
Yale will win the Yale-Harvard
game,

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:24.503
don't expect Yale students or
Harvard students to give an

00:05:24.503 --> 00:05:26.721
unbiased probability.
You tend to,

00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:29.829
in your mind,
think that you're going to win.

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:35.810
This also applies to
elections--we just had a primary

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.277
yesterday.
People tend to assume that the

00:05:39.277 --> 00:05:42.129
candidate that they believe in
will win.

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:47.281
So, it's well-known and this is
something that can be exploited

00:05:47.281 --> 00:05:51.398
by people selling investments.
Second thing:

00:05:51.398 --> 00:05:54.540
attention anomalies.

00:06:04.209 --> 00:06:09.839
These are--human attention
tends to be sporadic.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:14.519
That is that you--the errors
that people naturally make are

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:18.876
often errors of inattention.
You look at certain things and

00:06:18.876 --> 00:06:22.749
you overly--you pay too much
attention to some things and too

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.309
little to others.
This is something that

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:32.910
psychologists have been talking
about for over a hundred years.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.639
Human attention is part of
human intelligence.

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:40.140
We have to know what to pay
attention to People who are not

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.762
good in focusing their attention
on the right things--I'm not

00:06:43.762 --> 00:06:46.779
just talking about attention
deficit disorder,

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:50.045
I'm talking about some more
high-level question of how you

00:06:50.045 --> 00:06:52.680
know what you should be paying
attention to.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.786
Under attention,
there's a social basis for

00:06:57.786 --> 00:07:04.717
attention and that is that
people tend to pay attention to

00:07:04.717 --> 00:07:10.310
what other people are paying
attention to.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.744
It's easy to sweep things under
the rug and get people to forget

00:07:16.744 --> 00:07:19.934
something.
The kinds of things that are

00:07:19.934 --> 00:07:23.654
naturally talked about get
excessive attention and the

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:30.580
details tend to get forgotten.
Three is anchoring.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:39.745
This refers to a tendency for
people in making quantitative

00:07:39.745 --> 00:07:45.280
judgments to subconsciously have
their judgments anchored by some

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.901
arbitrary stimulus.
I mentioned overconfidence last

00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:52.028
period;
we then tend to have

00:07:52.028 --> 00:07:55.069
overconfidence in our anchored
judgments.

00:07:55.069 --> 00:08:00.782
The classic experiment that
demonstrated anchoring was

00:08:00.782 --> 00:08:06.710
Kahneman and Tversky--I'm
writing K&amp;T--in a wheel of

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:13.920
fortune experiment,
which they did in 1974.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.527
What they did was they got
subjects to participate in a

00:08:18.527 --> 00:08:23.816
psychological experiment and the
experiment consisted of asking

00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:28.680
the subjects questions that had
quantitative answers,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.259
which were always numbers from
zero to one hundred.

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:34.495
Then they said,
I'm going to ask you a question

00:08:34.495 --> 00:08:38.222
but before you answer the
question I'm going to spin a

00:08:38.222 --> 00:08:41.084
wheel of fortune.
You know what a wheel of--it's

00:08:41.084 --> 00:08:42.929
like one of those things on quiz
shows.

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:47.185
You spin this big wheel and it
rotates for a while and then it

00:08:47.185 --> 00:08:50.067
stops at one number,
but obviously a random number,

00:08:50.067 --> 00:08:52.806
because this wheel of fortune
had all the numbers from zero to

00:08:52.806 --> 00:08:55.874
one hundred.
One of the questions they asked

00:08:55.874 --> 00:09:00.200
was, what percent of African
nations belong to the United

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.808
Nations?
That apparently is a difficult

00:09:03.808 --> 00:09:08.129
question that most people didn't
know in 1974.

00:09:08.129 --> 00:09:12.532
The way they did it--they said,
we'll ask you the question and

00:09:12.532 --> 00:09:14.793
think about it,
but while you're thinking about

00:09:14.793 --> 00:09:16.593
it--don't answer yet--we're
going to spin this wheel of

00:09:16.593 --> 00:09:19.024
fortune.
So it comes up with a random

00:09:19.024 --> 00:09:21.899
number then they asked for the
answer.

00:09:21.899 --> 00:09:25.016
Well, it turns out that people
tended to give an answer close

00:09:25.016 --> 00:09:27.769
to the number that came up on
the wheel of fortune.

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:31.492
Now, they perfectly well knew
that the wheel of fortune was

00:09:31.492 --> 00:09:33.625
random.
So, the experimenters,

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:37.584
after they got the number,
they'd say, hey your number is

00:09:37.584 --> 00:09:41.190
almost the same as the number
that just came up.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.650
People would--and they would
say, did you just give me the

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.480
number that came up?
And people would deny it.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:48.539
They would say,
oh no I wasn't influenced by

00:09:48.539 --> 00:09:51.312
that number.
The point of anchoring is that

00:09:51.312 --> 00:09:54.817
you are subconsciously
influenced by numbers and it

00:09:54.817 --> 00:09:58.379
affects your judgment;
you think you know.

00:09:58.379 --> 00:10:00.687
For example,
in looking at a stock,

00:10:00.687 --> 00:10:04.896
if you ask people to predict a
stock market price they think of

00:10:04.896 --> 00:10:09.104
some number that they saw before
and they are overly influenced

00:10:09.104 --> 00:10:11.754
by that number.
For example,

00:10:11.754 --> 00:10:15.630
in the late 1990s,
if you were to ask a

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:21.955
question--I'm hypothesizing--how
likely is it that the Dow will

00:10:21.955 --> 00:10:27.325
be over 10,000 by the year 2008?
People might give that a low

00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:30.117
probability because it had never
been over 10,000,

00:10:30.117 --> 00:10:32.966
so they just had no
psychological anchoring on that

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:35.794
number.
Once it passes 2000,

00:10:35.794 --> 00:10:39.440
then it seems completely
natural;

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.365
that's anchoring.
Related to this is the

00:10:43.365 --> 00:10:47.260
representativeness
heuristic.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:02.284
It seems to me that if you type
this you'll get a spell check

00:11:02.284 --> 00:11:05.938
error.
And that's Kahneman and Tversky

00:11:05.938 --> 00:11:10.639
again and it's related to
anchoring in some sense.

00:11:10.639 --> 00:11:16.286
What it means is that--it
refers to a human tendency to

00:11:16.286 --> 00:11:22.456
judge events on the basis of
similarity to other events that

00:11:22.456 --> 00:11:27.998
are prominent in our mind
without regard to the actual

00:11:27.998 --> 00:11:33.350
probability of the event.
I'll give you--in one of

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:38.803
Kahneman and Tversky's examples,
people were asked to judge the

00:11:38.803 --> 00:11:43.838
occupation of a young woman.
They had a description of the

00:11:43.838 --> 00:11:47.976
young woman and the woman was
described as sensitive,

00:11:47.976 --> 00:11:52.527
artistic, etc.
The occupation choices that

00:11:52.527 --> 00:11:56.672
they were allowed were:
bank teller,

00:11:56.672 --> 00:12:02.392
sculptress, or something else.
Many people chose sculptress

00:12:02.392 --> 00:12:05.435
because they thought,
well if she's a sensitive,

00:12:05.435 --> 00:12:08.220
artistic woman maybe she's a
sculptress.

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:14.125
But that is a terrible mistake
because we should know that

00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:20.140
sculptresses are very rare;
very few people have the job of

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.509
a sculptress or sculptor,
so it's a mistake.

00:12:24.509 --> 00:12:30.781
What it means is that people
will--what it means is--[I have

00:12:30.781 --> 00:12:36.095
to stuff this wire in my
pocket]--that we sometimes

00:12:36.095 --> 00:12:42.260
exaggerate in our imagination
some rare event and it colors

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.312
out thinking.
For example,

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:50.476
the stock market crash of 1929
is repeatedly re-expected even

00:12:50.476 --> 00:12:55.165
though it only happened once;
it's just prominent in our

00:12:55.165 --> 00:12:57.632
thinking.
People are looking at stock

00:12:57.632 --> 00:13:01.589
prices to see patterns that they
remember that are prominent in

00:13:01.589 --> 00:13:04.779
their thinking and then those
patterns are given an

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:08.457
exaggerated probability.
When we looked at the random

00:13:08.457 --> 00:13:11.851
walk series--I think the
representativeness heuristic

00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:15.740
played a role in there as well.
When you look at a random walk

00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:18.247
you have the intuitive
impression that you can

00:13:18.247 --> 00:13:21.533
extrapolate it--that it doesn't
look like--you can't believe

00:13:21.533 --> 00:13:24.798
it's really random,
but the reason you can is

00:13:24.798 --> 00:13:28.965
because you overweigh the
probability of certain things

00:13:28.965 --> 00:13:31.280
that caught your attention.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:36.450
There are some more.

00:13:53.179 --> 00:13:55.560
Five is gambling
behavior.

00:14:02.409 --> 00:14:07.986
Anthropologists have found that
gambling is present in all human

00:14:07.986 --> 00:14:11.240
cultures.
Not that everyone gambles but

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.800
there will be--you go to any
human society and ask about it

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.046
and there will be some game of
chance that they play at

00:14:20.046 --> 00:14:23.269
the--that influences their
thinking.

00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:28.965
The problem with--there's a
problem with gambling behavior

00:14:28.965 --> 00:14:34.361
because in a certain fraction of
the population we have

00:14:34.361 --> 00:14:39.046
pathological gambling.
One study estimated that 1.1%

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:42.715
of men and .5% of women,
for some reason more common

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:45.737
among men than women,
but in both sexes are

00:14:45.737 --> 00:14:50.190
pathological gamblers.
That means it's like alcoholism;

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:54.289
they cannot control themselves
and it ruins their lives.

00:14:54.289 --> 00:14:59.425
They get divorces because the
spouse complains that my husband

00:14:59.425 --> 00:15:03.803
or wife gambled away all of our
money and that's bad,

00:15:03.803 --> 00:15:08.601
but they can't stop themselves.
There's an organization called

00:15:08.601 --> 00:15:11.377
Gambler's Anonymous,
which is like Alcoholic's

00:15:11.377 --> 00:15:15.294
Anonymous.
It helps people who are really

00:15:15.294 --> 00:15:17.389
in trouble.
This is a problem.

00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:21.806
I think the financial industry
attracts people like that,

00:15:21.806 --> 00:15:25.670
so you're overrepresented--If
people are not quite

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:30.560
pathological--people who are
stimulated somehow by chance;

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:40.370
that is a problem.
Magical thinking.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:46.677
This refers--this actually goes
back to B.F.

00:15:46.677 --> 00:15:55.186
Skinner, a psychologist who
flourished in the first half of

00:15:55.186 --> 00:15:58.658
this century.
I actually had him as a

00:15:58.658 --> 00:16:00.730
next-door neighbor.
It was a strange thing.

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:06.770
I was visiting Harvard and MIT
in Cambridge and I rented a

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:10.480
house and this guy was next
door.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.252
He and I both used to walk into
work together--not together,

00:16:14.252 --> 00:16:17.576
I never really met him,
but I always felt an affinity

00:16:17.576 --> 00:16:19.801
to him.
He must have died twenty years

00:16:19.801 --> 00:16:23.015
ago by now.
But anyway, he did a famous

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:28.901
experiment with pigeons which,
in the 1940s--1948--in which he

00:16:28.901 --> 00:16:33.725
induced strange behavior
patterns in pigeons by the

00:16:33.725 --> 00:16:38.604
following simple experiment.
The experiment was,

00:16:38.604 --> 00:16:44.046
he would put--the pigeon was in
a cage and he'd let the pigeon

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:49.309
get pretty hungry--hungry
pigeons are not happy pigeons.

00:16:49.309 --> 00:16:53.690
Then he had a machine that
granted each pigeon one piece of

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.060
corn every fifteen seconds;
that's very,

00:16:57.060 --> 00:17:02.961
frustratingly slow for a hungry
pigeon to get one piece every

00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:06.053
fifteen seconds.
Then he observed,

00:17:06.053 --> 00:17:08.933
through time,
after subjecting pigeons to

00:17:08.933 --> 00:17:13.252
this torture for some time--it
might be not approved by--it's

00:17:13.252 --> 00:17:16.498
not really torture,
it's like dieting or something,

00:17:16.498 --> 00:17:18.360
you've all lived through that,
right?

00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:23.222
Semi-torture for a pigeon.
He noticed that the pigeons

00:17:23.222 --> 00:17:26.984
started behaving in strange ways
and he kept them separate so

00:17:26.984 --> 00:17:29.430
they couldn't learn from each
other.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.713
One pigeon was jumping up and
down a lot, another one was

00:17:32.713 --> 00:17:35.469
bobbing its head,
and another one was doing kind

00:17:35.469 --> 00:17:38.454
of a little dance.
What he concluded was,

00:17:38.454 --> 00:17:42.692
these pigeons were trying to
figure out what makes those

00:17:42.692 --> 00:17:46.930
pieces of corn come and they
started to think--well,

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.356
they had to get the interval
between corns right to make this

00:17:49.356 --> 00:17:51.317
work.
But he started--the pigeons

00:17:51.317 --> 00:17:53.118
started to think,
effectively,

00:17:53.118 --> 00:17:56.970
what was it I did just before
that last piece of corn came?

00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:59.916
I was bobbing my head,
so maybe I better bob my head

00:17:59.916 --> 00:18:02.920
again and sure enough another
piece of corn comes.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.415
So, he started assuming that
what they were doing is making

00:18:06.415 --> 00:18:10.199
the corn come.
But each one does a different

00:18:10.199 --> 00:18:11.999
thing.
If they're all in isolation

00:18:11.999 --> 00:18:13.740
they would all be doing
different things.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:16.250
I think our financial markets
are like that.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.632
That people--they develop some
investment strategy and through

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:22.743
pure chance it does well.
But they--because of over

00:18:22.743 --> 00:18:26.809
confidence and magical thinking,
it starts to go to their ego.

00:18:26.809 --> 00:18:29.539
They think, I'm really a smart
investor, I figured it out,;

00:18:29.539 --> 00:18:36.474
it can reinforce the behavior
until they get to maybe some

00:18:36.474 --> 00:18:40.136
terrible end.
It doesn't necessarily work out

00:18:40.136 --> 00:18:40.929
as well.
B.F.

00:18:40.929 --> 00:18:43.390
Skinner never let his pigeons
starve;

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:50.963
they all made it out alright.
There's something else called

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:59.130
quasi-magical thinking,
which was a term coined many

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:05.890
years later by Eldar Shafir and
Amos Tversky.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:12.675
Shafir is a young psychologist
at Princeton who teamed up with

00:19:12.675 --> 00:19:18.460
the old psychologist Tversky and
wrote this paper.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:29.548
What it refers to is--people
get the impression that they can

00:19:29.548 --> 00:19:34.773
control randomness.
Maybe the pigeons were thinking

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:36.160
that, maybe not,
we don't know;

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.223
Shafir and Tversky report
experiments with people,

00:19:41.223 --> 00:19:45.743
not pigeons.
Quasi-magical thinking is an

00:19:45.743 --> 00:19:52.660
illusion that they documented
that occurs regularly in people,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.573
which they might deny if asked
about, but there's an illusion

00:19:56.573 --> 00:20:00.029
that I can control randomness
through my willpower.

00:20:00.029 --> 00:20:05.142
I won't talk about their
experiments, but I just want to

00:20:05.142 --> 00:20:10.069
mention one by a Harvard
psychologist Ellen Langer.

00:20:10.069 --> 00:20:14.855
I mentioned this before--I
think I mentioned it before--if

00:20:14.855 --> 00:20:19.390
you say, I'm going to ask you to
bet on a coin toss.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.079
There are two different ways of
doing it.

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:25.337
One is to say,
how much will you bet and then

00:20:25.337 --> 00:20:27.697
I toss the coin.
The other way is,

00:20:27.697 --> 00:20:31.383
I toss the coin first and I can
conceal the outcome and then I

00:20:31.383 --> 00:20:33.740
ask, how much would you like to
bet?

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.168
Langer found that people want
to bet more if the coin hasn't

00:20:38.168 --> 00:20:41.855
been tossed yet.
Why would that be--why would

00:20:41.855 --> 00:20:44.740
you care?
It's still the same experiment.

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.771
It appears that people,
at some level,

00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:52.196
think that they can exert
willpower over it and control

00:20:52.196 --> 00:20:54.779
it.
This gives rise again to

00:20:54.779 --> 00:20:59.038
overconfidence among investors.
It's also--another example,

00:20:59.038 --> 00:21:01.609
which is relevant,
I don't know if any of you

00:21:01.609 --> 00:21:05.380
voted yesterday.
Why do people vote?

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.349
Because an economic theory
would say that nobody ever

00:21:09.349 --> 00:21:11.617
votes.
If we're all--conventional

00:21:11.617 --> 00:21:14.868
economic theory says,
we're all relentlessly selfish

00:21:14.868 --> 00:21:17.477
and calculating.
Isn't that what you've learned

00:21:17.477 --> 00:21:20.001
in economics?
Well, maybe you didn't

00:21:20.001 --> 00:21:23.660
necessarily but that is
economical theory.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:28.388
If you're relentlessly selfish
and calculating you would say,

00:21:28.388 --> 00:21:32.092
the chances that I decide the
election are zero,

00:21:32.092 --> 00:21:34.930
so I'm just not going to
bother.

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.307
The question is--you must have
thought that,

00:21:37.307 --> 00:21:39.538
right?
You know that you're not going

00:21:39.538 --> 00:21:42.400
to decide the election,
so what does it matter?

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.849
If you can introspect and ask,
why is it that I vote?

00:21:45.849 --> 00:21:49.433
I think that at least for many
of us, there is a sort of

00:21:49.433 --> 00:21:52.430
logical conundrum we go through
and that is,

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:56.420
if good people don't vote then
we'll be in a bad world;

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:59.956
so I have to vote to prove that
good people vote,

00:21:59.956 --> 00:22:03.238
then maybe it will happen.
If I'm a good person,

00:22:03.238 --> 00:22:05.559
then other people will be good
persons.

00:22:05.559 --> 00:22:10.381
This is magical thinking and it
affects people because it gives

00:22:10.381 --> 00:22:14.736
them a sense of confidence and
power over events that are

00:22:14.736 --> 00:22:18.079
thought to be random or
uncontrollable.

00:22:18.079 --> 00:22:29.488
It can also be something that
can be exploited by some not so

00:22:29.488 --> 00:22:37.259
nice people.
I want to talk about regulation.

00:22:37.259 --> 00:22:43.148
The problem with finance is
that it's a beautiful--financial

00:22:43.148 --> 00:22:48.837
institutions are beautiful
structures but they only are as

00:22:48.837 --> 00:22:56.253
good as the people who use them.
The problem is that the history

00:22:56.253 --> 00:23:03.529
of finance is the history of a
lot of people being exploited

00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:09.989
and treated badly,
so there are temptations from

00:23:09.989 --> 00:23:13.886
the market.
People who know human

00:23:13.886 --> 00:23:20.009
psychology know that they can
exploit human weaknesses.

00:23:20.009 --> 00:23:27.559
There's a temptation to
oversell investments.

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:31.643
That is, promise that they will
do well--you see this all the

00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:33.702
time.
I was just seeing yesterday's

00:23:33.702 --> 00:23:35.829
paper--someone was selling gold
coins.

00:23:35.829 --> 00:23:40.276
Don't buy gold coins that you
might see--and you know that,

00:23:40.276 --> 00:23:42.702
right?
There were words in there--they

00:23:42.702 --> 00:23:45.917
said something--of course,
we cannot guarantee that they

00:23:45.917 --> 00:23:49.015
won't go up in value but
historically they have always

00:23:49.015 --> 00:23:52.559
done it or something like that.
They're trying to oversell.

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:56.063
You know that buying gold coins
from some newspaper ad is not a

00:23:56.063 --> 00:23:58.663
smart investment,
but they know that there will

00:23:58.663 --> 00:24:01.289
be people out there.
A recent example of

00:24:01.289 --> 00:24:05.098
overselling: the National
Association of Realtors has been

00:24:05.098 --> 00:24:09.107
running ads saying that home
prices have always doubled every

00:24:09.107 --> 00:24:12.143
ten years.
They didn't word it that--they

00:24:12.143 --> 00:24:15.939
put it in the present tense:
home prices double every ten

00:24:15.939 --> 00:24:18.312
years.
That's an organization of

00:24:18.312 --> 00:24:22.753
people who sell real estate and
they have ad campaigns trying to

00:24:22.753 --> 00:24:26.490
convince you that home prices
are going to double.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:30.801
That's overselling because
we're in a real estate crisis

00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:35.505
and home prices are falling and
that's the kind of thing that

00:24:35.505 --> 00:24:39.819
makes some people upset.
There's a tendency to hide

00:24:39.819 --> 00:24:40.880
information.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.222
You avoid telling people the
things that would discourage

00:24:48.222 --> 00:24:50.155
them.
People have attention

00:24:50.155 --> 00:24:54.660
anomalies, so they don't go out
and see all the information and

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:59.019
if you don't put it up front,
then they'll never find it.

00:24:59.019 --> 00:25:04.940
There's a tendency for loyalty
to friends--that's your own

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:10.549
friends--and there's this word,
other people.

00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:13.059
I think different languages
have different words for

00:25:13.059 --> 00:25:15.864
thisâ€“-there are friends
and then there are all those

00:25:15.864 --> 00:25:17.980
random people that we don't care
about.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.389
So, investors will have a
tendency to try to hide--or

00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:27.054
people who sell investments will
try to channel the good

00:25:27.054 --> 00:25:32.057
investments to their friends and
dump the bad stuff on other

00:25:32.057 --> 00:25:34.699
people.
That's what has been happening

00:25:34.699 --> 00:25:37.880
a little bit--more than a little
bit--in the subprime crises.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.685
We've managed to package
subprime loans that we

00:25:41.685 --> 00:25:45.905
thought--some people
thought--were terrible and sell

00:25:45.905 --> 00:25:50.289
them off to unwitting foreigners
who didn't know.

00:25:50.289 --> 00:25:52.420
They thought that they were
getting good stuff.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:26:00.049
There's also a tendency for
churning for commission.

00:26:00.049 --> 00:26:03.990
This is a fault that real
estate brokers can make.

00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:07.603
If they're paid by commission
on each trade they just keep

00:26:07.603 --> 00:26:11.470
calling you up and coming up
with new ideas for new trades.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:19.083
That's unethical behavior
because it--if you keep trading

00:26:19.083 --> 00:26:25.609
too much, then you cannot
possibly make money.

00:26:25.609 --> 00:26:28.942
The trading commissions will
eat up all of your profits and

00:26:28.942 --> 00:26:31.700
professionals know that,
so it's bad behavior.

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:42.537
We have historically developed
regulations that deal with these

00:26:42.537 --> 00:26:46.097
problems.
The only reason I believe that

00:26:46.097 --> 00:26:48.991
we have financial markets that
work is because we have

00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:51.920
regulations.
I'm going to talk primarily

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.415
about U.S.
regulations and give a little

00:26:55.415 --> 00:26:57.869
history of them.
The U.S.

00:26:57.869 --> 00:27:01.368
is actually an important
country for regulation because

00:27:01.368 --> 00:27:05.062
it has been a model for much of
the regulations around the

00:27:05.062 --> 00:27:08.576
world.
I'm going to give a kind of a

00:27:08.576 --> 00:27:14.802
history of financial regulations
in the United States that makes

00:27:14.802 --> 00:27:19.690
it rather a simple story.
The simple story is that

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:24.636
regulation mostly came in with
the Progressive Era at the

00:27:24.636 --> 00:27:29.759
beginning of the century and
reached its culmination at the

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:35.059
time of the Great Depression and
set up a lot of institutions

00:27:35.059 --> 00:27:40.125
that are still with us today.
Then there was deregulation,

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:44.301
which started around the 1970s,
and the events we've seen--that

00:27:44.301 --> 00:27:48.477
we're seeing today--are outcomes
of both the regulation and the

00:27:48.477 --> 00:27:53.054
deregulation.
I want to start out with the

00:27:53.054 --> 00:27:57.140
origins of securities
regulation.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:03.485
A critical point was a book
written by Louis Brandeis,

00:28:03.485 --> 00:28:10.309
that's the guy that Brandeis
University is named after.

00:28:10.309 --> 00:28:16.557
He was an author,
a lawyer, then Supreme Court

00:28:16.557 --> 00:28:24.888
Justice, but he wrote a book in
1914 called Other People's

00:28:24.888 --> 00:28:30.720
Money and it was very
influential.

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.006
I have it on reserve,
but that's not required for the

00:28:33.006 --> 00:28:35.562
mid-term;
it's just if you're interested

00:28:35.562 --> 00:28:39.768
in seeing it.
He believed that the most

00:28:39.768 --> 00:28:46.505
important step for the
government in promoting better

00:28:46.505 --> 00:28:53.112
financial markets is
disclosure--to force businesses

00:28:53.112 --> 00:29:00.237
or financial businesses to
disclose the truth equally to

00:29:00.237 --> 00:29:04.545
everybody.
His famous quote is,

00:29:04.545 --> 00:29:08.440
"Sunshine is the best
disinfectant."

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.433
Sunshine, meaning the truth,
and everyone in the financial

00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:14.269
industry has to just tell people
what they're doing.

00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:19.609
He said it has to be really
disclosed and he likened it to

00:29:19.609 --> 00:29:22.036
labeling.
They were already,

00:29:22.036 --> 00:29:25.992
in 1914, starting to require
that food packages show

00:29:25.992 --> 00:29:30.569
nutritional--or ingredients and
nutritional information.

00:29:30.569 --> 00:29:34.224
It was on the package and he
thought, that's the kind of

00:29:34.224 --> 00:29:36.549
model for the financial
industry.

00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:39.796
The disclosure has to be made
convenient so that--it's not

00:29:39.796 --> 00:29:43.327
like you can get the information
by going downtown to City Hall

00:29:43.327 --> 00:29:46.986
and asking for it.
The principle is that you have

00:29:46.986 --> 00:29:51.640
to require that the information
be given to the investor.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.289
That was a very
important--Around the time of

00:29:56.289 --> 00:30:01.150
this book, state regulators were
developing,

00:30:01.150 --> 00:30:06.595
at the state government level
in the United States,

00:30:06.595 --> 00:30:14.990
what they called Blue Sky Laws.
These were laws regulating how

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:20.445
securities are sold.
There are different theories

00:30:20.445 --> 00:30:23.440
about why they call them Blue
Sky Laws.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.616
I think it was because people
were overselling investments and

00:30:26.616 --> 00:30:29.689
saying, there's no limit to this
investment but the blue sky

00:30:29.689 --> 00:30:32.967
above.
The problem with the Blue Sky

00:30:32.967 --> 00:30:38.577
Laws was that they were each
done separately and it was hard

00:30:38.577 --> 00:30:45.869
for states to manage what were,
basically, national businesses.

00:30:45.869 --> 00:30:49.539
So the Blue Sky Laws were
basically coming in the teens.

00:30:49.539 --> 00:30:54.829
In the 1920s,
things changed because the

00:30:54.829 --> 00:31:00.119
telephone first became widely
spread.

00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:03.465
Until the teens,
telephones were very expensive

00:31:03.465 --> 00:31:07.609
because they didn't have good
amplification technology.

00:31:07.609 --> 00:31:10.325
But by the '20s,
everybody got a telephone in

00:31:10.325 --> 00:31:13.780
their house and the average
person made hundreds of phone

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:17.679
calls a year,
so it was a big change in our

00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:23.475
society, This led to the boiler
rooms--these were businesses

00:31:23.475 --> 00:31:29.076
that called around on the
telephone and sold stocks--often

00:31:29.076 --> 00:31:33.982
bogus stocks--in the 1920s.
The reason they call them

00:31:33.982 --> 00:31:37.083
boiler rooms is,
if you are selling stocks by

00:31:37.083 --> 00:31:40.819
telephone there's no reason to
rent a nice office,

00:31:40.819 --> 00:31:44.293
so you get the cheapest--so you
put a whole bank of telephones

00:31:44.293 --> 00:31:46.787
in the cheapest place.
That would be the basement of

00:31:46.787 --> 00:31:48.420
some building where they have
the boiler.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.914
So, you'd have a whole bunch of
people selling securities down

00:31:51.914 --> 00:31:54.951
there and they could vacate
quickly if the authorities

00:31:54.951 --> 00:31:57.240
challenged you.
In the 1920s,

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:01.857
a lot of bogus stuff was
sold--a lot of people were

00:32:01.857 --> 00:32:06.660
cheated--so after the stock
market crash of 1929,

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.970
it led to a movement for
regulation.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:23.228
The most important thing was
the 1934 foundation of the

00:32:23.228 --> 00:32:34.579
Securities and Exchange
Commission--or SEC--which I

00:32:34.579 --> 00:32:38.180
think,
ultimately dates back

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.663
toâ€“it was really the
embodiment of Louis Brandeis'

00:32:41.663 --> 00:32:45.312
principles.
This Securities and Exchange

00:32:45.312 --> 00:32:51.331
Commission was an organization
that--I guess you could say its

00:32:51.331 --> 00:32:56.856
principal structure--its
principal thing was to make sure

00:32:56.856 --> 00:33:02.973
that disclosure was proper and
that people found it easy to get

00:33:02.973 --> 00:33:06.920
the information about
securities.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:13.146
The SEC was very controversial
at first because it was seen as

00:33:13.146 --> 00:33:17.230
interfering with business and
the U.S.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:20.670
has been built on principles of
individual freedom;

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:23.609
this seemed like unnecessary
government intrusion.

00:33:23.609 --> 00:33:27.878
There was a hostile attitude
between business and the

00:33:27.878 --> 00:33:32.378
original SEC.
Franklin Delano Roosevelt was

00:33:32.378 --> 00:33:38.688
viewed as very left-wing by
business and very contrary to

00:33:38.688 --> 00:33:42.244
American values.
But in fact,

00:33:42.244 --> 00:33:48.725
the SEC promoted the very
free-market concepts that were

00:33:48.725 --> 00:33:54.490
widely believed in this country.
Basically, what it did was it

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:57.150
made it feel that people
wouldn't get cheated;

00:33:57.150 --> 00:34:03.427
the SEC was a strong regulator
and it really did restore

00:34:03.427 --> 00:34:09.590
confidence in the financial
markets in this country.

00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:12.816
Other countries--In Europe,
after the 1929 crash,

00:34:12.816 --> 00:34:16.850
they had a different reaction
to the scandals and problems of

00:34:16.850 --> 00:34:20.547
the '20s and it wasn't as
favorable to markets as in the

00:34:20.547 --> 00:34:22.882
U.S.
The Securities and Exchange

00:34:22.882 --> 00:34:26.575
Commission, from the beginning,
had it as its mission to make

00:34:26.575 --> 00:34:33.150
financial markets work properly;
that is a wonderful story.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:44.503
One of the first Chairmen of
the SEC was a man named William

00:34:44.503 --> 00:34:50.084
O.
Douglas, who was actually a

00:34:50.084 --> 00:34:56.241
Yale law professor.
I guess he influences me

00:34:56.241 --> 00:35:00.426
because--I have on the reading
list--again it's an optional

00:35:00.426 --> 00:35:05.047
reading,
but he has a book called

00:35:05.047 --> 00:35:13.659
Democracy and Finance
1940 and what he advocated

00:35:13.659 --> 00:35:23.706
again was that financial markets
have to be made to work for the

00:35:23.706 --> 00:35:27.094
people.
I guess this influenced

00:35:27.094 --> 00:35:29.273
meâ€“actually,
in my 2003 book,

00:35:29.273 --> 00:35:32.275
New Financial Order,
 I talked about the

00:35:32.275 --> 00:35:35.469
democratization of finance as a
fundamental principle.

00:35:35.469 --> 00:35:38.405
We have to make finance work
for real people,

00:35:38.405 --> 00:35:41.674
so for me that meant
understanding human frailties

00:35:41.674 --> 00:35:45.610
and understanding human
psychology to make things work.

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:53.944
He was also a major figure in
the Legal Realism school that

00:35:53.944 --> 00:36:01.273
recognized human failings and
human behavior and the

00:36:01.273 --> 00:36:07.198
establishment of laws.
We have to realize that people

00:36:07.198 --> 00:36:11.357
don't read all the fine print
and don't understand--if you

00:36:11.357 --> 00:36:15.370
have a precisely written
contract in legal language,

00:36:15.370 --> 00:36:20.287
maybe they don't get it.
One of the things that came out

00:36:20.287 --> 00:36:26.619
and was firmly embodied into law
with the advent of the SEC.

00:36:26.619 --> 00:36:32.119
There were precursors to this,
but the SEC forces the

00:36:32.119 --> 00:36:38.571
difference between public and
private securities and this is a

00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:44.074
very important distinction.
Public securities are

00:36:44.074 --> 00:36:49.793
securities that the SEC will
accept as suitable for the

00:36:49.793 --> 00:36:55.725
general public and private
securities are securities that

00:36:55.725 --> 00:37:02.079
have not been vetted by the SEC
for the general public.

00:37:02.079 --> 00:37:09.542
The SEC--you have to
decide--you hear about public

00:37:09.542 --> 00:37:16.255
companies and private companies.
If you're a public company it

00:37:16.255 --> 00:37:19.485
means that you've gone through
the procedures at the SEC to be

00:37:19.485 --> 00:37:23.079
approved as a public company.
If you are a public company,

00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:27.355
the important thing is you have
to do all of the disclosure that

00:37:27.355 --> 00:37:32.213
Louis Brandeis would have liked;
you have to file regular forms

00:37:32.213 --> 00:37:35.360
with the SEC,
disclosing information.

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:40.769
Public companies--these public
companies--if you want to get on

00:37:40.769 --> 00:37:46.973
the SEC website,
go to sec.gov and then there is

00:37:46.973 --> 00:37:53.250
a tab that you can click,
which is Edgar.

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:58.385
If you click on Edgar you can
enter the name of any public

00:37:58.385 --> 00:38:03.701
company in the United States and
then all of its filings are

00:38:03.701 --> 00:38:09.287
online and you can find out an
incredible amount of information

00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:12.008
about companies.
It's all there,

00:38:12.008 --> 00:38:13.829
as long as they're public
companies.

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:17.734
A public--a lot of companies
don't want to be public because

00:38:17.734 --> 00:38:20.050
you can't keep secrets very
well;

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:22.869
you've got to regularly put
those things up online and

00:38:22.869 --> 00:38:25.050
they're out there for everybody
to see.

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:30.780
Companies can choose whether to
be public or private.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.919
Why do they choose to be public?
Well they--it's a

00:38:33.919 --> 00:38:36.946
balancing--they have to
balance--sometimes they don't

00:38:36.946 --> 00:38:40.497
like the choice they made but
the advantage to being public is

00:38:40.497 --> 00:38:44.847
that people trust you more.
Moreover, your market is

00:38:44.847 --> 00:38:49.719
bigger, so public companies have
an advantage;

00:38:49.719 --> 00:38:52.980
so companies don't like to be
public, generally.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:54.420
It's contrary to their
instincts.

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:56.800
We keep all sorts of secrets in
our company;

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:00.512
we don't want to be filing all
of our information all the time

00:39:00.512 --> 00:39:04.225
and to have it go right up on
the website on standard forms so

00:39:04.225 --> 00:39:06.659
that everyone can easily process
it.

00:39:06.659 --> 00:39:11.447
They may swallow their doubts
because they have a sense that

00:39:11.447 --> 00:39:15.179
it will improve the market for
their shares.

00:39:15.179 --> 00:39:18.280
So we have a lot of public
companies.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:27.755
Now, if you are a private
company, you are limited to

00:39:27.755 --> 00:39:34.679
where you can sell your
investments.

00:39:34.679 --> 00:39:38.652
Let's take an example of an
important kind of private

00:39:38.652 --> 00:39:41.020
company, called a hedge fund.

00:39:54.599 --> 00:40:00.180
If you are--this is a private
investment company--let's think

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.923
before we talk about
hedge--think of--suppose you're

00:40:04.923 --> 00:40:09.760
a public investment company
approved by the SEC.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:12.672
The problem with being a public
investment company is you have

00:40:12.672 --> 00:40:15.585
to file quarterly reports about
all the things you've invested

00:40:15.585 --> 00:40:17.582
in.
So you say, how can I make

00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:21.099
money beating the market if
every quarter I have to tell

00:40:21.099 --> 00:40:24.675
everybody what I'm doing?
A lot of investment companies

00:40:24.675 --> 00:40:28.063
don't want to be public,
they want to be private so they

00:40:28.063 --> 00:40:31.197
don't have to.
Hedge funds do not post their

00:40:31.197 --> 00:40:34.219
investments on Edgar,
so they're private.

00:40:34.219 --> 00:40:39.057
If you're a private company,
you're subject to regulation

00:40:39.057 --> 00:40:42.599
that limits a lot of things you
can do.

00:40:42.599 --> 00:40:45.889
Notably, you're not allowed to
advertise.

00:40:45.889 --> 00:40:48.561
If you're a hedge fund,
you're not for the

00:40:48.561 --> 00:40:52.340
public--you're not approved for
investing by the public.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:55.414
So, what business do you have
to buy ads in newspapers

00:40:55.414 --> 00:40:57.995
announcing yourself.
As a result,

00:40:57.995 --> 00:41:02.019
hedge funds have a very low
profile.

00:41:02.019 --> 00:41:05.407
It's not their choice--they
might like to advertise--but

00:41:05.407 --> 00:41:08.239
they can't without running afoul
of the SEC.

00:41:08.239 --> 00:41:10.087
They'll say,
you're behaving like a public

00:41:10.087 --> 00:41:13.886
company and you're not public.
So, hedge funds do not

00:41:13.886 --> 00:41:20.097
advertise, that's why people
don't know about them and they

00:41:20.097 --> 00:41:24.809
have a mysterious--they sound
mysterious.

00:41:24.809 --> 00:41:31.096
Moreover, very significantly,
they are limited in what kind

00:41:31.096 --> 00:41:36.794
of investors they can take.
Now, there are different kinds

00:41:36.794 --> 00:41:42.243
of hedge funds--there's a lot of
legal complexity here--but a 3c1

00:41:42.243 --> 00:41:46.500
hedge fund is limited to
ninety-nine investors.

00:41:51.099 --> 00:41:55.068
That's not very many people and
they must be accredited

00:41:55.068 --> 00:41:55.950
investors.

00:42:03.949 --> 00:42:06.679
You ask, what is an accredited
investor?

00:42:06.679 --> 00:42:10.219
Well, if you want to find out
you can get onto sec.gov and it

00:42:10.219 --> 00:42:12.519
will give you the current
definition.

00:42:12.519 --> 00:42:15.790
I wonder how many of you are
accredited investors?

00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:19.990
I would guess not many of you.
Here's how you become an

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.222
accredited investor:
(a) you have $1 million dollars

00:42:23.222 --> 00:42:26.390
in investable--that's not
including your house,

00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:32.659
it's in investable assets.
I won't ask for a show of hands.

00:42:32.659 --> 00:42:36.517
(b) You're making at least
$200,000 a year,

00:42:36.517 --> 00:42:41.569
or (c) if you're married,
you have to be a couple making

00:42:41.569 --> 00:42:47.909
at least $300,000.
So, it's supposed to be for

00:42:47.909 --> 00:42:50.639
rich people.
Incidentally,

00:42:50.639 --> 00:42:52.989
they haven't raised the
definition of accredited

00:42:52.989 --> 00:42:56.959
investors for many years.
Last year, the SEC put out a

00:42:56.959 --> 00:43:02.006
proposal that--it's getting too
easy to be an accredited

00:43:02.006 --> 00:43:06.869
investor--so they put out a
proposal that we raise the

00:43:06.869 --> 00:43:11.889
wealth level to $2.5 million.
I thought they were going to

00:43:11.889 --> 00:43:15.690
and that was to protect people
who might be naïve,

00:43:15.690 --> 00:43:19.045
innocent people who only have a
million dollars or only have two

00:43:19.045 --> 00:43:22.187
million dollars and don't know
what they're doing from hedge

00:43:22.187 --> 00:43:24.499
funds.
But, it got shot down

00:43:24.499 --> 00:43:27.719
apparently because it never
happened.

00:43:27.719 --> 00:43:30.937
I think it's very hard to raise
the definition of accredited

00:43:30.937 --> 00:43:34.209
investors because the minute you
do that you're closing large

00:43:34.209 --> 00:43:37.699
numbers of people out from their
ability to invest in hedge funds

00:43:37.699 --> 00:43:40.566
and they don't like that;
they feel insulted,

00:43:40.566 --> 00:43:42.920
so there was a lot of angry
reaction.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:48.896
There's also another kind of
hedge fund, 3c7,

00:43:48.896 --> 00:43:54.329
which can take five hundred
investors.

00:43:54.329 --> 00:43:59.130
If they register as a 3c7,
they can take more investors.

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:05.510
But then, they're limited to
qualified purchasers.

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:07.809
This is just an example of
their regulations.

00:44:07.809 --> 00:44:14.839
A qualified purchaser has to
have at least $5 million dollars

00:44:14.839 --> 00:44:21.634
or, if it's an institution,
at least $25 million--that is a

00:44:21.634 --> 00:44:27.301
natural person.
A natural person refers to a

00:44:27.301 --> 00:44:34.428
human being, so it's $5 million
for natural persons and $25

00:44:34.428 --> 00:44:39.714
million for institutions.
So, if you're a small college

00:44:39.714 --> 00:44:43.339
with only $20 million in a
portfolio you don't come across

00:44:43.339 --> 00:44:46.325
as a qualified purchaser.
They're trying to protect

00:44:46.325 --> 00:44:49.219
innocent, small colleges who
only have $20 million dollars.

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:51.834
The idea is that people who
don't have much money can't

00:44:51.834 --> 00:44:54.545
afford expensive lawyers and
they can't figure it out and

00:44:54.545 --> 00:44:57.160
they really shouldn't be
investing in hedge funds.

00:45:05.909 --> 00:45:09.723
These public-private
distinctions are onerous--are

00:45:09.723 --> 00:45:13.614
offensive--to some people
because it seems like the

00:45:13.614 --> 00:45:16.650
government is acting like a
parent.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.781
Most of the people are--if
you're not accredited as an

00:45:19.781 --> 00:45:23.090
investor it's like the
government doesn't respect you;

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:26.170
it's like they're treating you
like children.

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.710
Why would it be that somebody
else is allowed to invest in a

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:34.404
hedge fund and I'm not?
It rankles, but on the other

00:45:34.404 --> 00:45:41.021
hand, these regulations survive
because the reality is that

00:45:41.021 --> 00:45:47.525
people are victimized all the
time and we can't just allow

00:45:47.525 --> 00:45:52.942
companies to act in secrecy.
This is something that I

00:45:52.942 --> 00:45:56.317
believe in--not everyone
believes in this--but the

00:45:56.317 --> 00:46:00.243
general principle has been
now--ever since the 1930s--that

00:46:00.243 --> 00:46:04.169
the general public is not
allowed to invest in things that

00:46:04.169 --> 00:46:09.953
are not properly documented.
Another important distinction

00:46:09.953 --> 00:46:17.164
in securities regulation is the
distinction between insider and

00:46:17.164 --> 00:46:22.371
outsider.
An insider is someone who is

00:46:22.371 --> 00:46:30.267
privy to the secret information
of a company and the secret

00:46:30.267 --> 00:46:35.440
information could be used to
trade.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:39.593
If you know the secrets of a
company, if you know some good

00:46:39.593 --> 00:46:43.030
news about the company before
the public does,

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:46.514
you could buy the shares of the
company and experience the

00:46:46.514 --> 00:46:50.383
profit when the price goes up.
You would be exploiting insider

00:46:50.383 --> 00:46:53.840
information and you would be
victimizing the outsiders.

00:46:53.840 --> 00:47:00.178
The idea, from the beginning at
the SEC, was that insiders

00:47:00.178 --> 00:47:06.405
should not be allowed to trade
on information that is not

00:47:06.405 --> 00:47:10.519
properly disclosed to the
public.

00:47:10.519 --> 00:47:18.600
There was an important change:
Regulation F.D.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.222
came in 2000.
F.D.

00:47:22.222 --> 00:47:26.642
stands for full
disclosure--this is a SEC

00:47:26.642 --> 00:47:31.170
regulation.
Regulation F.D.

00:47:31.170 --> 00:47:34.875
was, I think,
passed in recognition of the

00:47:34.875 --> 00:47:39.155
internet.
Under Louis Brandeis--Brandeis

00:47:39.155 --> 00:47:44.849
wanted companies to always
present the information,

00:47:44.849 --> 00:47:47.373
but for him it always meant
presenting a document,

00:47:47.373 --> 00:47:49.640
so they had something called a
prospectus,

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.474
for example.
You could not sell a security

00:47:52.474 --> 00:47:56.924
without giving a prospectus to
the potential buyers and the

00:47:56.924 --> 00:48:00.989
prospectus would be something
approved by the SEC.

00:48:00.989 --> 00:48:04.728
I don't know if the word is
approved but it's--you have to

00:48:04.728 --> 00:48:08.730
run it by the SEC and then you
always have to give that up.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:10.449
But he was living in the paper
age.

00:48:10.449 --> 00:48:16.190
We now live in the internet age
and so Regulation F.D.--I don't

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:21.190
know if it actually mentions the
internet but it's--the

00:48:21.190 --> 00:48:25.703
Regulation F.D.
basically says that whenever a

00:48:25.703 --> 00:48:31.028
company announces information it
has to be available almost

00:48:31.028 --> 00:48:34.699
instantly to everybody in the
market.

00:48:34.699 --> 00:48:38.562
So, the way it has worked out
in practice is that companies,

00:48:38.562 --> 00:48:41.377
when they have a major
announcement to make,

00:48:41.377 --> 00:48:43.800
they have some kind of web
event.

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.393
Anybody in the world--they
would be notified and they could

00:48:47.393 --> 00:48:49.809
get on and hear it as it's
happening.

00:48:49.809 --> 00:48:54.051
So we have meetings--big
meetings--on the web for

00:48:54.051 --> 00:48:57.409
disclosure of important
information.

00:48:57.409 --> 00:49:01.703
This has made it very clear
that there has to be--if you

00:49:01.703 --> 00:49:06.153
announce anything you have to
announce it all at once on a

00:49:06.153 --> 00:49:11.072
certain date and you can't have
favored people that you give the

00:49:11.072 --> 00:49:16.804
announcement to.
Market surveillance is a

00:49:16.804 --> 00:49:27.173
process that stock exchanges and
other organizations do to make

00:49:27.173 --> 00:49:36.539
sure that inside information is
not being mishandled.

00:49:36.539 --> 00:49:40.232
The self-regulatory
organizations,

00:49:40.232 --> 00:49:45.715
SROs, are industry
organizations that regulate the

00:49:45.715 --> 00:49:49.510
industry.
That's the American way of

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:52.654
doing things.
Rather than have the government

00:49:52.654 --> 00:49:56.119
regulate, we have an industry
organization that does it so

00:49:56.119 --> 00:49:58.489
that the government doesn't have
to.

00:49:58.489 --> 00:50:04.409
The SROs have complex
regulatory equipment,

00:50:04.409 --> 00:50:12.161
computers that can discover
insider trading and the SROs

00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:19.489
will catch you or they may catch
you if you try.

00:50:19.489 --> 00:50:24.518
I want to give you an example
of SRO behavior and this is just

00:50:24.518 --> 00:50:27.942
one news story.
It was in 1995,

00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:35.087
a secretary at IBM Corporation
was asked to xerox some

00:50:35.087 --> 00:50:43.041
documents by her boss and the
documents described a proposed

00:50:43.041 --> 00:50:48.889
takeover of Lotus Corporation.
Remember Lotus?

00:50:48.889 --> 00:50:53.977
That was the corporation that
produced the first spreadsheet

00:50:53.977 --> 00:50:57.065
program.
It's now been replaced mostly

00:50:57.065 --> 00:51:00.308
by Microsoft Excel.
But at the time it was big,

00:51:00.308 --> 00:51:04.479
so this was big news.
IBM is going to take over Lotus

00:51:04.479 --> 00:51:09.506
or try to take over Lotus.
We now know what happened

00:51:09.506 --> 00:51:13.989
because of the surveillance
investigation.

00:51:13.989 --> 00:51:18.862
She told her husband that she
had just Xeroxed this thing--she

00:51:18.862 --> 00:51:22.616
had read what she was
Xeroxing--and she told her

00:51:22.616 --> 00:51:26.849
husband who was a beeper
salesman about the news.

00:51:26.849 --> 00:51:31.349
He did nothing except tell two
friends the story--he didn't buy

00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:35.267
shares, he just told two
friends, my wife says that IBM

00:51:35.267 --> 00:51:42.267
is going to take over Lotus.
The friends immediately bought

00:51:42.267 --> 00:51:50.219
Lotus shares and then--that was
June 2--by June 5,

00:51:50.219 --> 00:51:54.082
twenty-five people had
bought--had spent a half a

00:51:54.082 --> 00:51:57.059
million dollars to buy on this
tip.

00:51:57.059 --> 00:52:00.823
They included a pizza chef,
an electrical engineer,

00:52:00.823 --> 00:52:03.533
a bank executive,
a dairy wholesaler,

00:52:03.533 --> 00:52:06.769
a school teacher and four
stockbrokers;

00:52:06.769 --> 00:52:09.410
stockbrokers get the word
faster.

00:52:09.410 --> 00:52:13.868
Guess what happened?
Those people are all in trouble

00:52:13.868 --> 00:52:18.161
because it's illegal to trade on
insider information and they

00:52:18.161 --> 00:52:24.162
tracked them all down.
I'll give you another example

00:52:24.162 --> 00:52:30.989
and this is the example of
Emulex Corporation.

00:52:30.989 --> 00:52:34.312
Maybe this isn't exactly
insider trading,

00:52:34.312 --> 00:52:38.300
this is more fraud but in--what
year was this?

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:44.198
Around sometime in the late
'90s, Mark Jacob--he's the

00:52:44.198 --> 00:52:49.429
criminal here,
he's probably out of jail now.

00:52:49.429 --> 00:52:56.087
Mark Jacob was upset with--he
had been an employee of Emulex

00:52:56.087 --> 00:53:02.179
and had access to inside
information of the company.

00:53:02.179 --> 00:53:06.920
I guess he was involved in the
dissemination of information for

00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:11.659
the company, so he kind of knew
how they did press releases.

00:53:11.659 --> 00:53:15.599
So he sent out a fake--he
bought--he shorted the company

00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:19.466
and he--the stock in the
company--and he bought--he put

00:53:19.466 --> 00:53:23.907
out a fake press release saying
that there was bad news for the

00:53:23.907 --> 00:53:27.190
company.
He knew how to make it look one

00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:31.185
of Emulex's press releases.
He also did it from the El

00:53:31.185 --> 00:53:35.130
Camino Community College Library
because he thought,

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:37.629
I'll be careful,
I won't issue this fake press

00:53:37.629 --> 00:53:40.684
release on my own computer
because they might be able to

00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:42.739
track me back to my own
computer.

00:53:42.739 --> 00:53:45.500
So, he went to this community
college and got one of their

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.309
library computers and he issued
the press release there.

00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:51.258
He got picked up by all the
major news services,

00:53:51.258 --> 00:53:54.458
the stock plummeted,
he sold immediately and he made

00:53:54.458 --> 00:53:58.070
a lot of money.
The problem is, it didn't work.

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:02.229
They tracked back who sold--who
shorted and who had sold just

00:54:02.229 --> 00:54:06.578
before--just at that time.
They also went back to the El

00:54:06.578 --> 00:54:11.229
Camino Community College Library
and they interviewed the

00:54:11.229 --> 00:54:14.219
librarians and tried to ask
them,

00:54:14.219 --> 00:54:16.708
do you remember somebody coming
here that didn't look like a

00:54:16.708 --> 00:54:20.248
student?
They identified him and he was

00:54:20.248 --> 00:54:24.239
caught.
That's what surveillance does.

00:54:24.239 --> 00:54:31.210
They make the markets work
because if you didn't have this

00:54:31.210 --> 00:54:37.570
there would be all kinds of
crooks and bad actors.

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:41.754
The thing about these
organizations is that they cost

00:54:41.754 --> 00:54:46.034
money and they cause nuisances.
A lot of people in the

00:54:46.034 --> 00:54:49.875
financial community are annoyed
by them because these

00:54:49.875 --> 00:54:54.232
regulations are costly to comply
with and they take a lot of

00:54:54.232 --> 00:54:58.050
resources.
I think the enlightened view is

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:03.035
that these things are absolutely
essential to trust in the

00:55:03.035 --> 00:55:09.269
market.
Another form of regulation is

00:55:09.269 --> 00:55:15.568
accounting regulation.
For example,

00:55:15.568 --> 00:55:24.446
we have in the United States
the Financial Accounting

00:55:24.446 --> 00:55:34.690
Standards Board--it's right here
in Connecticut--or FASB.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:37.199
This is not a government
organization.

00:55:37.199 --> 00:55:43.750
It was organized by the SEC in
1973, but the SEC didn't want to

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:48.216
do this job;
they wanted it to be done

00:55:48.216 --> 00:55:52.663
privately.
What FASB does for the United

00:55:52.663 --> 00:55:58.497
States is it creates what are
called Generally Accepted

00:55:58.497 --> 00:56:04.908
Accounting Practices.
They're rules for how a company

00:56:04.908 --> 00:56:11.806
should keep its books so that
there's some regularity and

00:56:11.806 --> 00:56:16.610
standards in how accounting is
done.

00:56:16.610 --> 00:56:22.825
When the Financial Accounting
Standards Board listens to what

00:56:22.825 --> 00:56:28.523
corporations are saying and
helps them--it adjusts these

00:56:28.523 --> 00:56:34.739
standards from time to time but
it does have definitions that

00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:41.762
have to be maintained.
A company has a profit and loss

00:56:41.762 --> 00:56:49.610
statement and there's something
that is called net income,

00:56:49.610 --> 00:56:54.936
which is the measure of how
much the company is making--the

00:56:54.936 --> 00:56:58.610
profits after expenses of the
company,

00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:06.830
called the bottom line.
The GAAP standards define this.

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:12.667
There's also operating income.
Now, companies can use other

00:57:12.667 --> 00:57:18.558
definitions of--other accounting
standards besides these and some

00:57:18.558 --> 00:57:23.388
of these other definitions,
which are not always

00:57:23.388 --> 00:57:29.695
GAAP--other standards--and are
widely used in the industry are

00:57:29.695 --> 00:57:35.590
other kinds of--they have what's
called core earnings,

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:45.566
pro forma earnings,
EBITDA, which is earnings

00:57:45.566 --> 00:57:54.410
before interest,
taxes, depreciation,

00:57:54.410 --> 00:58:00.019
and amortization.
Adjusted earnings.

00:58:00.019 --> 00:58:03.139
There are all kinds of
different definitions and

00:58:03.139 --> 00:58:06.922
companies like to do it their
own way because they want to

00:58:06.922 --> 00:58:10.440
present themselves in the best
way to the public.

00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:13.489
But they're not allowed to just
do it their own way;

00:58:13.489 --> 00:58:18.712
they have to do it according to
standards, so the GAAP

00:58:18.712 --> 00:58:23.071
accounting is standardized.
What a company can do is

00:58:23.071 --> 00:58:25.449
present things in two different
ways.

00:58:25.449 --> 00:58:30.756
They can present GAAP and then
that goes to Edgar and they can

00:58:30.756 --> 00:58:34.409
also present it any other way
they like.

00:58:34.409 --> 00:58:39.962
But the law--the SEC requires
that they at least present the

00:58:39.962 --> 00:58:44.949
standard earnings definitions
for all these things.

00:58:44.949 --> 00:58:50.181
Now another--let me just
mention off balance sheet

00:58:50.181 --> 00:58:53.836
accounting.
The one thing that the SEC

00:58:53.836 --> 00:58:58.281
requires that companies file is
their balance sheet,

00:58:58.281 --> 00:59:02.639
which you can look up for any
company on Edgar.

00:59:02.639 --> 00:59:13.090
The balance sheet of a company
has two columns;

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:16.570
it has assets and it has
liabilities.

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:25.215
So, on one side is everything
the company owns and the other

00:59:25.215 --> 00:59:27.190
side is everything the company
owes.

00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:32.520
The net worth of the company is
their assets minus their

00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:38.432
liabilities and that represents
the value that the company has

00:59:38.432 --> 00:59:42.599
if they paid off all their
liabilities.

00:59:42.599 --> 00:59:48.654
What the SEC has to worry about
is something called off balance

00:59:48.654 --> 00:59:50.510
sheet accounting,

00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.735
which occurs when companies try
to hide some of the things that

01:00:01.735 --> 01:00:07.014
they--the liabilities that they
have by not recording them on

01:00:07.014 --> 01:00:11.528
the balance sheet.
If you can get away with that

01:00:11.528 --> 01:00:16.862
then you can do--you can conceal
maybe some risky investments

01:00:16.862 --> 01:00:21.130
you've made or some leverage
that you've had.

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:24.807
You might have brought in
investments or something by

01:00:24.807 --> 01:00:28.131
borrowing money,
so the investment--the combined

01:00:28.131 --> 01:00:31.880
investment and liability--could
be very volatile.

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:34.811
You don't want people to know
that, so you don't put it on the

01:00:34.811 --> 01:00:38.342
balance sheet.
The SEC and other regulators

01:00:38.342 --> 01:00:42.581
have to watch for this.
The classic example of a

01:00:42.581 --> 01:00:46.480
company that did this--it's a
classic now--is Enron

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.333
Corporation.
They had a number of

01:00:50.333 --> 01:00:57.309
partnerships that they put on as
off balance sheet.

01:00:57.309 --> 01:01:02.449
They were making risky
investments but they weren't

01:01:02.449 --> 01:01:08.822
reporting them properly on the
SEC forms, so people didn't know

01:01:08.822 --> 01:01:14.957
how risky Enron was.
More recently--this came out

01:01:14.957 --> 01:01:21.638
last year--the SIVs,
so called structured investment

01:01:21.638 --> 01:01:27.250
vehicles,
were used by banks to cover up

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:34.389
investments they had,
often in risky subprime loans.

01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:39.117
Well, they created special
entities called SIVs and the

01:01:39.117 --> 01:01:44.546
SIVs would be borrowing money on
the commercial paper market to

01:01:44.546 --> 01:01:49.134
buy subprime loans.
They were in a very risky

01:01:49.134 --> 01:01:55.623
position because subprime loans
were already recognized as being

01:01:55.623 --> 01:01:58.415
risky.
They'd borrow to buy them,

01:01:58.415 --> 01:02:02.719
so if the value of the subprime
loans went down just a little

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:06.627
bit the SIV would be in trouble.
In the SIV contract,

01:02:06.627 --> 01:02:10.538
there was some language that
implied that if the SIV ever

01:02:10.538 --> 01:02:13.472
went bankrupt,
the bank would come back and

01:02:13.472 --> 01:02:17.302
rescue them.
The SIV really was a liability

01:02:17.302 --> 01:02:22.409
but it wasn't visible to
investors investing in the bank.

01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:27.015
This is another example of off
balance sheet accounting that

01:02:27.015 --> 01:02:30.059
was frustrating the rules of the
SEC.

01:02:30.059 --> 01:02:39.199
I wanted to talk about another
instance of regulation that is

01:02:39.199 --> 01:02:48.340
important in the United States
but it's very poorly known.

01:02:48.340 --> 01:03:02.766
We have something called SIPC,
that's the Securities Investor

01:03:02.766 --> 01:03:15.269
Protection Corporation,
which was created in 1970.

01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:21.300
This is the securities' analog
of the FDIC in banking.

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.281
I don't know if I mentioned--I
assume you know about the

01:03:24.281 --> 01:03:26.450
Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation?

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:30.210
I thought that was better-known.
Well, let me just mention it by

01:03:30.210 --> 01:03:34.938
analogy.
In 1934, after the failure--it

01:03:34.938 --> 01:03:43.533
was actually created by Congress
in 1933 and went into business

01:03:43.533 --> 01:03:48.637
in '34.
The FDIC, Federal Deposit

01:03:48.637 --> 01:03:57.857
Insurance Corporation--I'll put
it down as 1934--guaranteed for

01:03:57.857 --> 01:04:06.780
small depositors the savings
deposits they had at a bank.

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.602
That was to protect depositors
in the case of bank failure and

01:04:11.602 --> 01:04:15.159
it was a very important
innovation because,

01:04:15.159 --> 01:04:17.289
at that time,
there were huge runs on banks.

01:04:17.289 --> 01:04:20.003
People were pulling money out
of banks because they feared

01:04:20.003 --> 01:04:22.383
that if the bank failed,
then they would lose their

01:04:22.383 --> 01:04:25.412
money;
it created a huge crisis in

01:04:25.412 --> 01:04:29.450
1933.
It's for small investors

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:36.970
because currently the limit on
the SEC is $100,000;

01:04:36.970 --> 01:04:42.840
that's not a lot of money.
Maybe you think of it as a lot

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.380
of money, but it's not.
If someone's saving for their

01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.659
retirement you better have a lot
more than that;

01:04:49.659 --> 01:04:53.857
$100,000 is only a few years of
income even for low-income

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:57.075
people.
At least we want to protect the

01:04:57.075 --> 01:04:59.960
small investors' savings in
banks.

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:04.062
Actually, if you have more than
$100,000 in a bank account you

01:05:04.062 --> 01:05:08.097
should probably pull it out and
spread it around over several

01:05:08.097 --> 01:05:11.460
banks because each bank is
separately insured,

01:05:11.460 --> 01:05:14.547
so there's effectively no limit
if you're just a little bit

01:05:14.547 --> 01:05:16.570
smart and move your accounts
around.

01:05:16.570 --> 01:05:21.484
We had deposit insurance
starting in The Great Depression

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:26.530
and that's been very important;
it's now in every country.

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:35.412
We had a run on a bank in the
UK, it was called Northern Rock,

01:05:35.412 --> 01:05:39.389
last year.
It turns out that there was a

01:05:39.389 --> 01:05:44.002
failure of the UK deposit--I
would say it's a failure because

01:05:44.002 --> 01:05:48.616
UK deposit insurance insured
Northern Rock only for the first

01:05:48.616 --> 01:05:52.351
£3,000.
Then for the next--I forget how

01:05:52.351 --> 01:05:57.053
many thousand pounds--you were
90% insured so that was not good

01:05:57.053 --> 01:06:01.073
enough because people were
worried about losing 10% of

01:06:01.073 --> 01:06:04.550
their deposits.
So there was a big bank run and

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:08.345
Northern Rock would have failed
if the Bank of England hadn't

01:06:08.345 --> 01:06:13.046
come by to rescue them.
I think that deposit insurance

01:06:13.046 --> 01:06:19.363
is very important but we didn't
have anything for corresponding

01:06:19.363 --> 01:06:25.680
accounts at brokerage services
until 1970 This was motivated by

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:29.960
a spectacular failure of a
brokerage,

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:35.940
Goodbody &amp; Co., in 1970.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.801
I hope you know what I mean;
a brokerage service is a place

01:06:44.801 --> 01:06:48.527
where stockbrokers work and a
stockbroker is somebody that

01:06:48.527 --> 01:06:51.469
manages your buying and selling
of shares.

01:06:51.469 --> 01:06:55.239
So if you want to buy stock you
can call the stockbroker.

01:06:55.239 --> 01:06:59.304
Merrill Lynch is a big retail
broker--they're right down here

01:06:59.304 --> 01:07:01.779
on the Green.
You can go there and say,

01:07:01.779 --> 01:07:04.697
I want to buy stocks,
and the broker will say fine,

01:07:04.697 --> 01:07:06.739
we'll set up an account for
you.

01:07:06.739 --> 01:07:09.598
You've deposited money in our
accountâ€“now,

01:07:09.598 --> 01:07:12.335
he's not a bank,
he's a broker--we'll set up a

01:07:12.335 --> 01:07:14.889
cash account and a securities
account.

01:07:14.889 --> 01:07:18.170
Put some money in and then you
think about it and then you call

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:20.710
me up and say,
do you want to buy some stocks.

01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:24.543
Then I'll take money out of
your cash account and I'll put

01:07:24.543 --> 01:07:27.389
it into these securities.
That's a broker.

01:07:27.389 --> 01:07:30.486
Goodbody &amp;
Company was a broker,

01:07:30.486 --> 01:07:35.617
but it failed in 1970--it went
bankrupt--and then it looked

01:07:35.617 --> 01:07:41.280
like the people who had money
and shares in them would lose.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.645
There are two things:
you can have a cash account

01:07:43.645 --> 01:07:46.651
with them--you put money into
the cash account and you haven't

01:07:46.651 --> 01:07:49.751
bought shares with it yet;
it's just sitting--it's like in

01:07:49.751 --> 01:07:52.103
a bank.
You could lose that because

01:07:52.103 --> 01:07:55.110
Goodbody &amp;
Company is going bankrupt;

01:07:55.110 --> 01:07:57.849
it doesn't have it anymore.
Well, what about your shares?

01:07:57.849 --> 01:08:00.996
Well, Goodbody &amp;
Company is supposed to have

01:08:00.996 --> 01:08:04.745
your shares but they generally
hold them in what's called

01:08:04.745 --> 01:08:07.715
"street name."
That means Goodbody &amp;

01:08:07.715 --> 01:08:11.528
Company owns the shares and you
just have a contractual

01:08:11.528 --> 01:08:14.638
relationship with Goodbody that,
in principle,

01:08:14.638 --> 01:08:18.245
some of those shares are yours.
But the company that you're

01:08:18.245 --> 01:08:21.939
investing in ultimately doesn't
have your money.

01:08:21.939 --> 01:08:24.128
It's Goodbody that they're
dealing with,

01:08:24.128 --> 01:08:27.551
although they have ways of--for
a proxy--and they have ways of

01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:30.448
finding out who's who.
The problem is,

01:08:30.448 --> 01:08:35.340
if your brokerage firm fails
you could lose a lot;

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.196
you could lose your cash
account and your security

01:08:38.196 --> 01:08:42.810
account.
So, SIPC was set up in 1970 and

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:51.130
SIPC insures cash accounts up to
$100,000 and securities accounts

01:08:51.130 --> 01:08:56.566
up to $500,000.
That's another example of

01:08:56.566 --> 01:09:02.833
government involvement.
SIPC was set up by an act of

01:09:02.833 --> 01:09:07.832
Congress.
So theâ€“unfortunately,

01:09:07.832 --> 01:09:13.920
I don't know--have you ever
heard of SIPC?

01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:15.580
Most people don't even know it
exists.

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:20.347
SIPC did a survey of the U.S.
population and this is one of

01:09:20.347 --> 01:09:23.949
the--In 2001,
this is one of the questions

01:09:23.949 --> 01:09:26.931
SIPC asked.
The respondents were asked to

01:09:26.931 --> 01:09:30.676
identify the organization that
insures you against losing money

01:09:30.676 --> 01:09:34.300
in the stock market or as the
result of investment fraud.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:40.220
Only 16% of investors knew that
there is no such company.

01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:44.686
Let me make this clear,
SIPC does not--if you invest in

01:09:44.686 --> 01:09:49.649
some stock and it does badly you
can't go to SIPC and say,

01:09:49.649 --> 01:09:53.800
hey my stocks went down please
give me my money back.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:57.186
They won't do it.
Moreover, if you say,

01:09:57.186 --> 01:10:01.520
this stockbroker he was lying
to me, he told me that this was

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:05.782
a good investment and he even
lied and said something to get

01:10:05.782 --> 01:10:08.229
me roped in,
they won't pay you back.

01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:12.060
The only thing that SIPC does
is replace securities.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:14.492
In other words,
if you had an account at a

01:10:14.492 --> 01:10:18.052
brokerage and you thought you
had a hundred shares of IBM and

01:10:18.052 --> 01:10:20.960
now the broker is going
bankrupt--the broker won't

01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:24.460
answer your email anymore and
he's just gone--you go to SIPC

01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:27.819
and say,
I had these hundred shares.

01:10:27.819 --> 01:10:31.980
SIPC than returns a hundred
shares to you;

01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:34.696
they don't pay you cash.
They give you the hundred

01:10:34.696 --> 01:10:38.220
shares and that's all they do.
You might say that our

01:10:38.220 --> 01:10:41.399
regulation hasn't gone far
enough and I think maybe it

01:10:41.399 --> 01:10:44.806
hasn't gone far enough.
We protect certain kinds of

01:10:44.806 --> 01:10:47.609
things and people have to pay
attention.

01:10:47.609 --> 01:10:52.356
It's a difficult problem that
not everyone is smart--they vary

01:10:52.356 --> 01:10:56.714
in their ability--so we try to
make a world in which it's

01:10:56.714 --> 01:11:00.604
pretty safe for the small
investor who's not paying

01:11:00.604 --> 01:11:04.117
attention.
It's never perfect and we can't

01:11:04.117 --> 01:11:08.651
figure out yet a way to make it
perfect and we still have small

01:11:08.651 --> 01:11:12.600
investors who are defrauded,
who are treated badly.

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.788
The subprime crisis is an
example: some people were

01:11:15.788 --> 01:11:18.850
treated badly in this recent
financial crisis.

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:21.872
So, we just have to keep
improving our regulation and

01:11:21.872 --> 01:11:25.649
trying to make a deal with all
of the problems as they come up.

01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:28.820
The problems are complex
because we're trying to make a

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.401
system in which people are able
to make their own decisions as

01:11:32.401 --> 01:11:35.513
much as possible and to make
them in a way that--in an

01:11:35.513 --> 01:11:39.017
environment that they trust.
But it's just too complicated

01:11:39.017 --> 01:11:41.720
and too--it's impossible to make
it work perfectly.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:44.369
So, that will conclude this
lecture.

01:11:44.369 --> 01:11:50.326
So I'll--I won't be here Monday
but my T.A.'s will handle the

01:11:50.326 --> 01:11:54.000
exam and I'll see you on
Wednesday.

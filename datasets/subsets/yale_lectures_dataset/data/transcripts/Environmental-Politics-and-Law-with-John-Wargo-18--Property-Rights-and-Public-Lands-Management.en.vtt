00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.640
I wanted to continue talking
about property rights and the

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.675
environment,
and also to talk more about

00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:08.640
public lands and natural
resource management problems.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.540
And I wanted to pick up on some
of the questions that were

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.714
raised on Tuesday with respect
to the property regime that was

00:00:16.714 --> 00:00:20.820
created by the State of New York
in the Adirondack Park.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.029
And part of the problem with
encouraging people to behave in

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.239
accordance with law is their
perception of legitimacy of the

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.270
purpose of the law.
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.123
How consistent are their values
with the values that are

00:00:36.123 --> 00:00:38.250
embedded in law as a mission
statement?

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.620
So what factors can you imagine
would influence your perception

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.440
of the legitimacy of a new
regulation?

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.237
One thing might be the way that
you might have been allowed to

00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:52.972
participate or were excluded
from the decision making process

00:00:52.972 --> 00:00:55.400
to set up a new rule to begin
with.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.648
Another might be resistance,
annoyance or a perception of

00:01:00.648 --> 00:01:06.552
immorality that some other group
or individual is imposing their

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:08.239
values on you.
 

00:01:08.239 --> 00:01:12.867
So one way to think about the
history of the Adirondack Park

00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:16.789
is that prior to 1973,
the local governments really

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.769
had authority to control land
use.

00:01:19.769 --> 00:01:22.959
After the passage of the law,
the next day,

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.537
all of a sudden,
they did not have that

00:01:24.537 --> 00:01:26.751
authority anymore,
and the rights of private

00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:28.629
landowners were radically
reduced.

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:32.718
So they went from a condition
of being rather free to develop

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:36.601
their land as they pleased to
one where they really had to

00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:39.599
understand the technical nature
of law,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.965
as well as where they were on
this map that had the force of

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:44.410
law.
 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.519
What zone did they fall within?
 

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:51.152
And the argument is also,
the perception of legitimacy,

00:01:51.152 --> 00:01:54.239
is also curiously tied to
science.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.720
And what's the relationship
then between science and law?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.391
So that if this law was
designed in a way to prevent

00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:07.879
damage from being incurred by
new development,

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.306
then how certain are these
experts sitting inside the

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:14.930
government agency that the
damage is likely to occur?

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.090
What is the likelihood?
 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.098
Are they thinking about it
formally in terms of

00:02:20.098 --> 00:02:23.824
probabilities of damages and
magnitudes of distribution of

00:02:23.824 --> 00:02:24.610
damages?
 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.889
How are they thinking about the
need to bring evidence,

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.388
data, and strong science to
questions about damage that

00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:38.470
supposedly justify these new
restrictions on their liberty?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.590
And what would a population
that is low in income,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.178
relatively low in educational
attainment compared to other

00:02:46.178 --> 00:02:48.990
parts of New York,
what's their capacity to

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.038
challenge these new regulations?
 

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:54.637
I mean, do they have the
ability or the money to hire

00:02:54.637 --> 00:02:58.720
ecologists or soil scientists or
atmospheric scientists,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.222
water quality experts,
to challenge the government's

00:03:02.222 --> 00:03:06.275
claim that if they build the way
they want to that damage is

00:03:06.275 --> 00:03:07.580
going to occur?
 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:12.468
Also, the idea of compensation,
we'll talk more about that,

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:15.145
especially next week when we
think about climate change in

00:03:15.145 --> 00:03:17.776
the coastal zone and what that
means for all the property

00:03:17.776 --> 00:03:20.546
owners and the trillions of
dollars in property value in the

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:21.438
coastal zone.
 

00:03:21.438 --> 00:03:26.639
So that under what kinds of
conditions do land owners,

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.631
can they expect compensation
for loss in property value

00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:34.770
that's associated with these new
laws and regulations?

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.788
And I want to also mention the
work of Max Weber.

00:03:40.788 --> 00:03:43.423
Max Weber was a social
scientist in the early part of

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:46.205
the twentieth century,
latter part of the nineteenth

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.559
century,
and he wrote about the idea of

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:49.229
authority.
 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.991
And I mentioned on Tuesday,
and I want to reinforce this

00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:56.000
idea that property is a form of
authority.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.448
It basically is a social
relationship among those who are

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:04.977
given rights and those are
obliged to follow those rights,

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:07.438
to not invade those rights.
 

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:10.810
In a way, a right is a kind of
a sphere of liberty.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.957
And what happened in the
Adirondacks is that this sphere

00:04:14.957 --> 00:04:18.451
of liberty was reduced,
and it was reduced largely

00:04:18.451 --> 00:04:21.574
based on the claim of the
government and environmental

00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:24.697
experts that damage was
occurring from new development

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:26.759
and that it should be stopped.
 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.680
Now, when you think about the
sources of legitimacy and law,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.500
if you go back into political
and social theory,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.740
you'll find really three
dominant sources that are

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.129
commonly mentioned.
 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.603
You know, one is the authority
of the state to pass law,

00:04:43.603 --> 00:04:48.158
their sovereign authority,
the state meaning any level of

00:04:48.158 --> 00:04:49.379
government.
 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.805
Another would be charisma,
the authority that is commanded

00:04:53.805 --> 00:04:58.000
by a charismatic leader,
perhaps a religious leader.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.767
And the third,
that I find to be most relevant

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:04.028
to this discussion today,
is the idea of tradition.

00:05:04.028 --> 00:05:08.365
So that the idea that there's
been a traditional pattern of

00:05:08.365 --> 00:05:12.028
behavior that has been
acceptable in a society.

00:05:12.028 --> 00:05:14.970
We've always been allowed to
sell off five acres a year.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.949
Or we've been able to develop
when we wanted to.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:21.120
Now you're telling us that we
can't do that.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.250
So possession is often thought
of as being nine-tenths of the

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.389
law, I'm sure you've heard that
phrase.

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.389
Well, this idea that tradition
and custom really underlie the

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.389
sense of legitimacy is really
quite important.

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.024
So when people have rights
taken away, they appeal to their

00:05:39.024 --> 00:05:42.850
customary pattern of behavior
and their traditional rights.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.452
You might also think about
theories in politics about the

00:05:47.452 --> 00:05:49.180
origin of property.
 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.899
How is property derived?
 

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:54.190
What's its source?
 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:06:00.100
Well, John Locke argued that
one source was God.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.204
God gave humans the right to
expropriate resources from the

00:06:05.204 --> 00:06:05.819
land.
 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:07.399
Another is labor.
 

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:10.860
And you probably have heard
about Locke's labor theory.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.886
So that if you invest your
labor in improving land,

00:06:14.886 --> 00:06:19.476
then you are justified in
claiming ownership to the fruits

00:06:19.476 --> 00:06:21.410
of that improvement.
 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.990
Another is inheritance.
 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.857
And Rousseau wrote extensively
about the unfairness of

00:06:26.857 --> 00:06:30.360
inheritance laws and argued that
inheritance,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.911
allowing the next generation to
take the property from the

00:06:33.911 --> 00:06:37.545
previous one,
that inheritance really is the

00:06:37.545 --> 00:06:41.500
fundamental origin of inequality
in society.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.089
Another is scarcity.
 

00:06:43.089 --> 00:06:46.480
So you can imagine yourself
being alone on an island,

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.110
as Robinson Crusoe was.
 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.658
So that there's really no need
for definition of property

00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:52.230
rights.
 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.005
Basically, there may have been
conditions of scarcity,

00:06:56.005 --> 00:07:00.495
but there was no need to set up
rules about who could get access

00:07:00.495 --> 00:07:02.490
to the scarce resources.
 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:05.442
So that there were other
origins as well,

00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:07.139
including regulation.
 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:11.560
I think I'm becoming fascinated
by the relationship between the

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.838
act of regulation and the
creation of new property rights.

00:07:15.838 --> 00:07:19.562
So you might think about what
we all now are concerned about

00:07:19.562 --> 00:07:23.160
relative to climate change as
being stalled out because we

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.882
can't agree on a regulation to
cap the amount of carbon that

00:07:26.882 --> 00:07:30.480
would be allowed to be emitted
into the atmosphere.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.016
So once that cap is
established, that's going to set

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:37.971
the stage for the evolution of
markets and trading schemes

00:07:37.971 --> 00:07:40.329
among groups around the world.
 

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:45.266
So that property rights are
often created by regulation in

00:07:45.266 --> 00:07:48.730
ways that are not generally
perceived.

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.283
Another idea is that when
government regulates and creates

00:07:52.283 --> 00:07:55.899
permits or demands that you come
and you get a license,

00:07:55.899 --> 00:07:58.983
whether it's a driver's license
or a license to use a new

00:07:58.983 --> 00:08:00.750
pesticide,
whatever it is,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.338
if you're required to get a
permit,

00:08:03.338 --> 00:08:06.879
then that permit automatically
has value,

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:10.951
and developers will often buy
land and then try to get

00:08:10.951 --> 00:08:15.485
approval to develop that land
with no anticipation that they

00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:19.790
are going to actually carry
through the development.

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:21.139
But they're going to sell that
right.

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:23.850
They're going to sell the land
along with the permit,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.358
so that they will basically
accrue the increase in property

00:08:27.358 --> 00:08:30.019
value that's associated with a
new permit.

00:08:30.019 --> 00:08:33.533
And we saw in the atomic
weapons testing area,

00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:37.673
and also related to private
trade secrecy that secrecy

00:08:37.673 --> 00:08:39.860
creates property rights.
 

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:44.385
So that it creates great value
in the secret and there is often

00:08:44.385 --> 00:08:47.379
a black market in the trade of
secrets.

00:08:47.379 --> 00:08:50.639
So there are a variety of
different kinds of property.

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:53.490
You're most familiar with the
idea of private property and

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:54.389
public property.
 

00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:57.820
But there's also an idea in the
literature about the commons.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.086
So that there are these areas
of the environment or the

00:09:02.086 --> 00:09:05.879
universe that might be thought
of as commons,

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:08.830
where the property rights are
really not well defined.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.668
And Garrett Hardin wrote a
piece in 1968 called The

00:09:12.668 --> 00:09:14.769
Tragedy of the Commons.
 

00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:16.259
If you haven't read it,
I commend it to you.

00:09:16.259 --> 00:09:20.139
And it was a piece that argued
that if you have common land

00:09:20.139 --> 00:09:24.087
with undefined rights to it,
then people are going to try to

00:09:24.087 --> 00:09:26.230
take advantage of that land.
 

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.611
And he used the example of a
pasture in Great Britain where

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.820
everybody wanted to graze their
sheep on the pasture.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.333
Well, that's fine until you get
a critical mass of sheep on the

00:09:36.333 --> 00:09:39.452
pasture and all of a sudden you
lose the capacity of the

00:09:39.452 --> 00:09:41.720
landscape to regenerate the
grasses.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.206
Eventually, as more and more
people come and graze their

00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:49.009
sheep, then the resource is
going to be degraded and lost.

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:52.508
And he was using that as an
argument to justify regulation

00:09:52.508 --> 00:09:56.005
or a new form of control over
who would have access to the

00:09:56.005 --> 00:09:57.048
common lands.
 

00:09:57.048 --> 00:09:59.780
We also think about public
lands, I think,

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.580
in a very simplistic way.
 

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.738
And the rest of this lecture is
going to focus on public lands

00:10:05.738 --> 00:10:09.288
and also the very,
very different ways that rights

00:10:09.288 --> 00:10:13.666
can be allocated to public lands
and the implications of that for

00:10:13.666 --> 00:10:16.058
sustainable resource management.
 

00:10:16.058 --> 00:10:19.397
And also the fact that as you
look out across the landscape or

00:10:19.397 --> 00:10:21.860
you think about a nation or any
territory,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.466
you're going to have a pretty
complex hybrid among these

00:10:26.466 --> 00:10:29.649
different forms of private
property.

00:10:29.649 --> 00:10:33.495
And as somebody who might think
of themselves as pursuing a

00:10:33.495 --> 00:10:36.279
career to manage environmental
quality,

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:40.326
I'm going to make an argument
that you have very little

00:10:40.326 --> 00:10:44.297
capacity to manage an
environmental problem unless you

00:10:44.297 --> 00:10:48.418
understand with great clarity
the relationships that are

00:10:48.418 --> 00:10:51.940
created by these hybrid property
systems.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.210
So once you understand the
property regime in an area,

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:58.110
you have a much higher capacity
to manage it.

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.187
And especially next week,
we'll be talking more about the

00:11:01.187 --> 00:11:03.330
Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution,

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.726
"Nor shall private
property be taken for public use

00:11:05.726 --> 00:11:07.210
without just compensation."
 

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:13.043
That presented an opportunity
for courts through the twentieth

00:11:13.043 --> 00:11:18.590
century to the present to debate
where the threshold is.

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:21.274
What's an acceptable limit on
government authority to take

00:11:21.274 --> 00:11:22.168
private property?
 

00:11:22.168 --> 00:11:25.658
And when do they cross that
threshold and therefore have to

00:11:25.658 --> 00:11:29.509
compensate the private landowner
for taking away those rights?

00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:32.460
So what's justifiable public
use?

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.990
This has been heavily debated
in the courts.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.620
What government appropriation
becomes a taking?

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.779
When has land been rendered
valueless?

00:11:40.779 --> 00:11:43.791
And should government's
regulation of private property

00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:44.700
be restricted?
 

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.455
So let's kind of drop some of
these ideas down onto the

00:11:49.455 --> 00:11:51.038
Adirondack Park.
 

00:11:51.038 --> 00:11:53.950
And I mentioned that it's a six
million acre tract of land.

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:56.985
And we could have used a
different park or a different

00:11:56.985 --> 00:11:59.220
area--we could have used
Yellowstone.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.440
I'll use a couple of examples
in a few moments about

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.048
Yellowstone.
 

00:12:02.048 --> 00:12:05.061
But in this area,
you have six million acres of

00:12:05.061 --> 00:12:08.990
land about roughly fifty percent
of it is privately owned.

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:12.568
And the other fifty percent is
publically owned and was,

00:12:12.568 --> 00:12:15.758
as I described on Tuesday,
the Adirondack Mountain

00:12:15.758 --> 00:12:16.538
Reserve.
 

00:12:16.538 --> 00:12:20.585
So that it was Forest Preserve
land that the Constitution of

00:12:20.585 --> 00:12:24.629
New York protects against any
sort of timber harvesting,

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:27.118
any sort of structural
development unless that

00:12:27.118 --> 00:12:30.380
development is necessary to
protect that land on the part of

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.820
the State of New York.
 

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:36.011
And this land has been
classified under the statute

00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:39.363
that was adopted in 1973,
the Adirondack Park Agency

00:12:39.363 --> 00:12:42.557
Statute,
into a variety of different

00:12:42.557 --> 00:12:45.620
categories,
including wilderness in the

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.211
orange at the top,
so about eighteen percent of

00:12:48.211 --> 00:12:49.999
the area,
twenty percent of the area now

00:12:49.999 --> 00:12:51.480
has been designated as
wilderness.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.761
Using a standard that is more
rigorous than the federal

00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:58.907
wilderness designation standard,
which requires only 5,000 acres

00:12:58.907 --> 00:13:01.639
for a new wilderness area to be
created,

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:04.320
there are nearly twenty
separate wilderness areas in the

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.490
Adirondacks right now.
 

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:08.799
And the minimum size
requirement to create them is

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:11.433
10,000 acres,
so it's double the federal

00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:14.610
standard in the total area
that's required.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.428
They also have primitive areas.
 

00:13:16.428 --> 00:13:18.816
Primitive areas are like
wilderness except that they

00:13:18.816 --> 00:13:21.110
might have certain facilities on
the interior,

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.860
perhaps roadways,
perhaps fire towers,

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.629
perhaps ranger stations,
maybe some electric lines.

00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:31.513
And these primitive areas
constitute a rather small

00:13:31.513 --> 00:13:32.288
percent.
 

00:13:32.288 --> 00:13:35.313
Another area is an experimental
area that I'll show you a slide

00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:37.120
of in a moment called a canoe
area.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.803
And then about twenty-two point
four percent of this public

00:13:40.803 --> 00:13:44.423
land, twenty-two point four
percent of three million acres

00:13:44.423 --> 00:13:46.519
is classified as wild forest.
 

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:48.629
So just think about this for a
moment.

00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:52.097
This is the largest tract of
intact forest in the eastern

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:53.090
United States.
 

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:56.269
It's extremely rich in
biological diversity.

00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:58.639
And it has had this
century-long,

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:02.052
longer than a century,
system of control that is

00:14:02.052 --> 00:14:05.869
embedded in the Constitution of
the State of New York and then

00:14:05.869 --> 00:14:09.184
further refined by this
Adirondack Park Agency Statute

00:14:09.184 --> 00:14:13.062
into these different categories
that allowed very different and

00:14:13.062 --> 00:14:14.940
specific kinds of uses.
 

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.110
Now, think about the definition
of wilderness for just a moment.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.649
This is contained in the
Wilderness Act of 1964.

00:14:21.649 --> 00:14:24.664
"A wilderness in contrast
with those areas where man and

00:14:24.664 --> 00:14:27.479
his own works dominate the
landscape is hereby recognized

00:14:27.479 --> 00:14:30.243
as an area where the earth and
its community of life are

00:14:30.243 --> 00:14:32.770
untrammeled by man,
where man himself is a visitor

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:33.870
who does not remain."
 

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.490
Well, this is a very
interesting definition.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:41.509
It implies that the human
presence or any human influence

00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:44.379
in this area is not tolerable.
 

00:14:44.379 --> 00:14:49.134
So that the Adirondacks,
again with roughly a million

00:14:49.134 --> 00:14:53.705
and a quarter acres of
designated wilderness offers

00:14:53.705 --> 00:14:56.533
many,
many opportunities to seek

00:14:56.533 --> 00:15:00.801
solitude and get off on your own
and test your physical and

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:02.200
personal skills.
 

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.926
But what's quite interesting
about it is that people within

00:15:05.926 --> 00:15:09.394
these designated areas are
really drawn to a very small

00:15:09.394 --> 00:15:11.129
percentage of the area.
 

00:15:11.129 --> 00:15:12.889
People are drawn to the
mountain peaks.

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:17.182
The one reason why this
mountain peak is bald is because

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:21.866
people have hiked to the summit
so often and the soils on the

00:15:21.866 --> 00:15:26.629
summits of peaks throughout New
England are very shallow.

00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:28.080
So they're very vulnerable.
 

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.360
If the vegetation that this
young man is about to jump on,

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.051
if that vegetation is lost,
the soil that it sits on will

00:15:34.051 --> 00:15:36.470
be lost,
and it will erode down to

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:39.530
bedrock, and thereby,
it will never have opportunity

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.029
to support additional
vegetation.

00:15:41.029 --> 00:15:45.654
Kind of interesting,
I'll show you a clear cut in a

00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:48.798
western forest in just a moment.
 

00:15:48.798 --> 00:15:52.981
Now I want you to also think
about goals that people have for

00:15:52.981 --> 00:15:55.980
going into wilderness in
different areas.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:16:00.474
And I just was looking at the
cost of taking a trip and

00:16:00.474 --> 00:16:01.639
climbing Mt.
 

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:03.330
Everest in Nepal.
 

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.679
And for a single climber,
it's $25,000,

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:07.349
for two people,
it's 40,000,

00:16:07.349 --> 00:16:09.700
and for seven people it's
$70,000.

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:13.606
It was kind of interesting that
the governments in different

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:17.779
parts of the world are thinking
about the right to climb and the

00:16:17.779 --> 00:16:19.899
value of the right to climb.
 

00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:23.102
At the same time they're
thinking about the costs that

00:16:23.102 --> 00:16:26.607
the government might incur if
something goes wrong on those

00:16:26.607 --> 00:16:29.509
trips and they have to fund a
rescue effort.

00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:31.200
By the way, Mt.
 

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:36.684
Everest is about 29,000 feet in
elevation, but Denali in Alaska

00:16:36.684 --> 00:16:39.870
is about 20,000 feet in
elevation.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:43.364
So if you're willing to give up
that last 9,000 feet,

00:16:43.364 --> 00:16:46.590
you can go to the top of Denali
for only $200.

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:51.043
By the way, there are also many
parts of the world where

00:16:51.043 --> 00:16:54.928
climbing parties are required to
post a bond,

00:16:54.928 --> 00:16:59.105
a bond that would cover the
total cost of an expedition to

00:16:59.105 --> 00:17:03.649
go in and rescue them in the
case that something goes wrong.

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:07.230
Now in the Adirondacks,
another way to think about

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:10.666
wilderness, or my view of
wilderness was shifted

00:17:10.666 --> 00:17:11.910
dramatically.
 

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.712
And just as an aside,
when I was working in the

00:17:14.712 --> 00:17:17.028
Adirondack Park when I was
younger,

00:17:17.028 --> 00:17:21.599
my responsibility was to manage
the policy for these wilderness

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:22.190
lands.
 

00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:26.211
So that I faced constant
tension and argument and debate

00:17:26.211 --> 00:17:31.038
about what user group should be
allowed access into which areas.

00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:34.098
And if a new wilderness area
was being designated,

00:17:34.098 --> 00:17:36.500
people would fight to keep the
roads open,

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:40.669
to keep the ranger cabins open,
to basically maintain these

00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:43.759
traditional or customary
patterns of use.

00:17:43.759 --> 00:17:48.957
So one thing that I was struck
by was this tower that sits on

00:17:48.957 --> 00:17:51.730
the top of Whiteface Mountain.
 

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:56.307
White Face is the site of the
Olympic training downhill

00:17:56.307 --> 00:17:57.410
facilities.
 

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:01.931
And it's also a national
weather station that started to

00:18:01.931 --> 00:18:05.960
collect data during the 1970s
and early 1980s that

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.645
demonstrated that we were
experiencing significant changes

00:18:10.645 --> 00:18:12.618
in the atmosphere.
 

00:18:12.618 --> 00:18:18.457
We were experiencing increases
in sulfur and sulfur dioxide,

00:18:18.457 --> 00:18:23.799
nitrogen oxides that were
producing sulfuric and nitric

00:18:23.799 --> 00:18:24.788
acids.
 

00:18:24.788 --> 00:18:27.982
And these acids were having an
effect on a forest in the

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:31.058
Adirondacks and shifting the
biological diversity,

00:18:31.058 --> 00:18:33.657
particularly at high
elevations, in ways that really

00:18:33.657 --> 00:18:34.828
were not anticipated.
 

00:18:34.828 --> 00:18:37.630
Why high elevations and not low
elevations?

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.585
Well, it turns out that nobody
had really thought about the

00:18:41.585 --> 00:18:45.540
contribution of fog and clouds
that cluster around mountain

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:49.565
peaks as creating kind of an
intense and chronic exposure to

00:18:49.565 --> 00:18:53.180
the plants or animals that live
in those areas.

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:57.096
So that the red spruce decline
in the Adirondacks is now

00:18:57.096 --> 00:18:58.380
related to this.
 

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.695
The red spruce become
susceptible to a variety of

00:19:02.695 --> 00:19:07.911
different kinds of insects in
response to their exposure to

00:19:07.911 --> 00:19:09.890
increased acidity.
 

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:14.431
A paradox of wilderness and
thinking about how to manage it

00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:19.130
is that we tend to think about
it as nature and the wild,

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.618
but it really is a social
construction,

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:23.710
and there's a very strong
association with liberty.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.862
And the paradox is that if
you're managing a wilderness

00:19:26.862 --> 00:19:28.799
area,
then you have to think

00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:32.742
carefully about what intensity
of human use it could sustain

00:19:32.742 --> 00:19:35.150
and still maintain its
character.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.230
And many people,
and I am included,

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:41.480
think that when I go into a
wild area,

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.228
I'm not really interested in
signing up at a ranger station

00:19:44.228 --> 00:19:47.118
and getting a permit go into a
wilderness and being told where

00:19:47.118 --> 00:19:48.920
I can camp and where I can't
camp.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.732
That kind of defeats the
purpose, in my mind,

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:53.140
of what wildness is.
 

00:19:53.140 --> 00:19:55.240
So what's the origin of that
worry?

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.257
Well, it's basically the
association of wildness with

00:19:58.257 --> 00:19:59.358
personal freedom.
 

00:19:59.358 --> 00:20:02.965
But obviously,
as more and more people want to

00:20:02.965 --> 00:20:04.650
climb Denali or Mt.
 

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:06.834
Everest or go in to the high
peaks of the Adirondacks,

00:20:06.834 --> 00:20:08.730
it raises the question of
carrying capacity.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.509
What's an appropriate limit?
 

00:20:12.509 --> 00:20:16.309
So the Adirondack Park Agency
faced this question with respect

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:19.923
to many different ecosystems
that it had the responsibility

00:20:19.923 --> 00:20:21.730
under this law to manage.
 

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:27.115
There are some 2,000 different
islands on more than 1,000 lakes

00:20:27.115 --> 00:20:29.808
and ponds in the Adirondacks.
 

00:20:29.808 --> 00:20:33.910
And these tend to be pretty
small, a couple acres in size.

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:38.432
They also tend to be basically
just granitic bedrock that has

00:20:38.432 --> 00:20:43.107
very shallow soils so that new
development on these islands was

00:20:43.107 --> 00:20:45.220
quite highly restricted.
 

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:49.271
And islands are extremely
desirable from a developer's

00:20:49.271 --> 00:20:54.088
prospective, and also from the
perspective of recreationists.

00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:56.781
So that if you were canoeing
down this lake in the

00:20:56.781 --> 00:20:59.420
Adirondacks and you saw one of
these islands,

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.366
you probably would want to
canoe over to one and explore it

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:03.180
or camp on it.
 

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.420
And the state has built
campsites on these islands.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.952
So there are always questions
about how much development and

00:21:09.952 --> 00:21:11.568
what kind can it sustain.
 

00:21:11.568 --> 00:21:16.470
How much recreational intensity
can it sustain without damage?

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:18.896
In this case,
one of the key questions would

00:21:18.896 --> 00:21:21.550
be sewage disposal,
as I was mentioning with the

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:23.808
Camp Sagamore slide back on
Tuesday.

00:21:23.808 --> 00:21:29.820
So the FOOT group here,
when I was working with FOOT as

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:34.494
an advisor some years ago,
the FOOT crew went up to

00:21:34.494 --> 00:21:37.807
Adirondacks and I helped them
lay out trails through the

00:21:37.807 --> 00:21:40.880
Adirondacks that seemed like
they were suitable.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:43.941
But it was quite curious,
because the park became much

00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:47.406
more concerned about loss of
soil on the peaks and the routes

00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:50.410
and they decided that one
approach was going to be to

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.490
limit the size of the parties.
 

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.078
I can't remember the size.
 

00:21:54.078 --> 00:21:57.039
Some of you probably went on
FOOT, anybody in the room?

00:21:57.039 --> 00:22:00.500
What's the party size on FOOT?
 

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.519
Student: Each group?
 

00:22:01.519 --> 00:22:02.150
Prof: Yes.
 

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:02.759
Student: About ten.
 

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:03.420
Prof: About ten.
 

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.002
Well, this party size has been
now restricted to eight in the

00:22:06.002 --> 00:22:08.240
Adirondacks,
which basically meant if FOOT

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.750
was going to keep using the area
that it would have to reduce its

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:12.519
party size.
 

00:22:12.519 --> 00:22:16.330
So that there were kind of
interesting questions about cost

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:20.010
efficiency and the program
effectiveness related to party

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.640
size and many logistical
questions,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.150
so that they decided to back
out and to move to other sites.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.999
So this idea that for any
wilderness area,

00:22:27.999 --> 00:22:31.960
you would have both a kind of
physical, biological idea of

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.740
what its carrying capacity might
be.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.898
But there is also very
interesting literature on the

00:22:37.898 --> 00:22:41.676
psychology of wilderness that
has been pioneered by the Forest

00:22:41.676 --> 00:22:43.970
Service about what people
expect.

00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:45.269
What do people want?
 

00:22:45.269 --> 00:22:48.058
Do they want to see people when
they go back into remote areas?

00:22:48.058 --> 00:22:52.180
And most people would presume
that the answer would be no.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.252
But then if you look at the
pattern of wilderness use and

00:22:55.252 --> 00:22:58.435
national park use in our country
and pretty much around the

00:22:58.435 --> 00:23:01.502
world,
what you see is that wilderness

00:23:01.502 --> 00:23:05.160
is a playground for social
cohesion in a way.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.912
I mean, families go back,
friends go back into remote

00:23:08.912 --> 00:23:09.490
areas.
 

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.470
So that very few people go into
very remote areas alone.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.578
I find that to be kind of
interesting.

00:23:15.578 --> 00:23:22.660
So that it becomes an outdoor
opportunity for socialization.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:26.998
Another kind of right that you
might not think about is this

00:23:26.998 --> 00:23:30.970
right to use motor vehicles and
the right of access.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:35.701
And if you allow float plane
operators in the national park

00:23:35.701 --> 00:23:39.779
or a wilderness area,
you are creating a variety of

00:23:39.779 --> 00:23:41.818
management headaches.
 

00:23:41.818 --> 00:23:44.598
Now, float planes are not
allowed in wilderness areas.

00:23:44.598 --> 00:23:48.227
And when we decided we were
going to close off a large

00:23:48.227 --> 00:23:51.170
number of lakes to motor vehicle
access,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:56.990
either by car or use of boats
or jet skis or access by

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:59.825
aircraft,
you can imagine the howls that

00:23:59.825 --> 00:24:00.278
went up.
 

00:24:00.278 --> 00:24:03.266
Because people had gone on to
the public land as they have in

00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:04.808
many remote parts of the U.S.
 

00:24:04.808 --> 00:24:11.130
including in large areas of
Alaska.

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:13.930
And they have built these camps
on public land.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:16.984
And they claim that they've
been using this camp for the

00:24:16.984 --> 00:24:20.238
past couple of decades,
that their daddy used that camp

00:24:20.238 --> 00:24:23.445
and that they really have a
right to continue access and

00:24:23.445 --> 00:24:24.380
continue use.
 

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.089
Well, the strength of the
conflict is really driven by

00:24:29.089 --> 00:24:31.490
what options they've got.
 

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:33.996
And luckily in the Adirondacks,
remember you've got this

00:24:33.996 --> 00:24:36.683
wilderness category but you've
got these other categories as

00:24:36.683 --> 00:24:38.542
well,
where motor vehicles are

00:24:38.542 --> 00:24:39.068
allowed.
 

00:24:39.068 --> 00:24:42.320
And they would have similar
opportunities to fly into other

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:42.769
lakes.
 

00:24:42.769 --> 00:24:46.368
So that the politics was
managed basically because of the

00:24:46.368 --> 00:24:48.490
existence of alternative sites.
 

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.770
Still, those people that had
gone back to their camps and

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.992
invested in building camps,
and some of these camps were

00:24:54.992 --> 00:24:56.400
actually quite nice.
 

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.596
They had stoves,
they had propane gas stoves,

00:24:59.596 --> 00:25:02.720
they had heaters,
they had refrigerators.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.710
So that these were more than
modest little campsites.

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:08.926
The evolution of small,
motorized vehicles has also

00:25:08.926 --> 00:25:12.078
created a very significant
management headache.

00:25:12.078 --> 00:25:18.019
So that whether or not it's a
jet ski or an ATV,

00:25:18.019 --> 00:25:21.009
the Forest Service,
the Park Service,

00:25:21.009 --> 00:25:23.608
the Bureau of Land Management,
the Nature Conservancy,

00:25:23.608 --> 00:25:27.237
anybody who manages a large
tract of land in the United

00:25:27.237 --> 00:25:30.932
States today is faced with
worrying and trying to figure

00:25:30.932 --> 00:25:34.088
out how to manage access by
these vehicles.

00:25:34.088 --> 00:25:36.148
They're fast,
they're light,

00:25:36.148 --> 00:25:40.038
they can basically zip around
and escape rangers.

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:43.765
So that the amount of damage
these can cause is really quite

00:25:43.765 --> 00:25:44.650
interesting.
 

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:50.618
And many of the users are also
interested in hunting.

00:25:50.618 --> 00:25:57.065
And the ATVs provide basically
a vehicular method to pull game

00:25:57.065 --> 00:25:59.390
out of remote areas.
 

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:03.648
This shot of snowmobiles in
west Yellowstone is also

00:26:03.648 --> 00:26:05.318
interesting to me.
 

00:26:05.318 --> 00:26:08.220
West Yellowstone,
during the wintertime in

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.048
periods of peak usage by
snowmobiles,

00:26:11.048 --> 00:26:13.915
where they have conventions of
thousands of snowmobiles in west

00:26:13.915 --> 00:26:16.805
Yellowstone,
the particulate and ozone air

00:26:16.805 --> 00:26:21.423
quality is often worse than it
is in New York City or it is in

00:26:21.423 --> 00:26:22.558
Los Angeles.
 

00:26:22.558 --> 00:26:26.567
So that there has been an
improvement in the emissions

00:26:26.567 --> 00:26:28.759
from these smaller engines.
 

00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:32.940
But still, they are
significantly less efficient

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.118
than our motor vehicle engines,
such as cars.

00:26:37.118 --> 00:26:42.183
I also wanted to mention that
the Adirondacks has a bunch of

00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:44.328
scientific experiments.
 

00:26:44.328 --> 00:26:47.577
And one of the values of
wilderness is to provide an

00:26:47.577 --> 00:26:51.269
environment where scientific
experiments can take place.

00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:56.051
And the idea that the ecology
and the chemistry of Adirondack

00:26:56.051 --> 00:27:00.992
ecosystems is being transformed
by our coal burning behavior in

00:27:00.992 --> 00:27:04.660
the Midwestern part of the
United States,

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.365
so that the emissions from the
Midwest sweep up the Ohio

00:27:08.365 --> 00:27:11.021
Valley,
they sweep into Pennsylvania

00:27:11.021 --> 00:27:14.308
and New York State,
and that's really one of the

00:27:14.308 --> 00:27:17.328
predominate sources of the acid
aerosols here.

00:27:17.328 --> 00:27:21.061
And now these lakes are
basically barren of native

00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:22.509
strains of trout.
 

00:27:22.509 --> 00:27:26.400
And it's primarily because
they're highly dependent upon an

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:30.491
acidity level not getting above,
or the pH not getting below a

00:27:30.491 --> 00:27:31.700
certain level.
 

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.001
In this case,
a variety of different

00:27:34.001 --> 00:27:38.078
experiments have been attempted,
including liming the lakes.

00:27:38.078 --> 00:27:41.008
When I was there,
we would fix buckets,

00:27:41.008 --> 00:27:43.858
these really large buckets of
lime.

00:27:43.858 --> 00:27:47.212
And helicopters would pick up
the buckets and drop the lime

00:27:47.212 --> 00:27:50.739
over the lakes in an attempt to
buffer the acidity and make it

00:27:50.739 --> 00:27:53.630
more suitable for the native
strains of trout.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.851
Eventually, this became so
cumbersome and they realized it

00:27:56.851 --> 00:28:00.298
would cost way too much to apply
this broadly across different

00:28:00.298 --> 00:28:01.430
lakes and ponds.
 

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:04.259
That instead,
they thought about genetic

00:28:04.259 --> 00:28:07.960
modification of fish to increase
their tolerance.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.299
So that there are now a variety
of different species of trout

00:28:11.299 --> 00:28:14.306
that have been genetically
engineered to make them more

00:28:14.306 --> 00:28:15.028
tolerant.
 

00:28:15.028 --> 00:28:18.468
So that when I mentioned
earlier that my perception of

00:28:18.468 --> 00:28:21.842
what wilderness is was
transformed by the atmospheric

00:28:21.842 --> 00:28:25.930
testing that took place on the
top of White Face Mountain,

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:27.509
this is what I meant.
 

00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:31.005
Also, if you go back to some of
the old growth timber in the

00:28:31.005 --> 00:28:33.805
park,
timber that's been there for at

00:28:33.805 --> 00:28:37.681
least say fifty or sixty years,
and if you did a core,

00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:41.441
so in other words if you took a
screw and you cored into the

00:28:41.441 --> 00:28:45.136
tree and you pulled out a core
of wood all the way from the

00:28:45.136 --> 00:28:49.273
center of the tree,
you could test back in time and

00:28:49.273 --> 00:28:53.869
have a chemical replication of
what was in the air during

00:28:53.869 --> 00:28:55.430
different years.
 

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:59.354
So one of the interesting
things that you could find is

00:28:59.354 --> 00:29:01.970
the period between 1945 and
1963,

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.608
which was the atomic weapons
testing era,

00:29:04.608 --> 00:29:07.795
you would find the
radionuclides in some species of

00:29:07.795 --> 00:29:10.278
timber that are of that age up
there.

00:29:10.278 --> 00:29:14.038
So that in some way,
they become a chronicle of past

00:29:14.038 --> 00:29:15.660
atmospheric quality.
 

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:20.097
The Olympic training facility
in the Adirondacks also

00:29:20.097 --> 00:29:25.390
presented many different kinds
of property rights questions.

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:29.574
This is the downhill ski
facility, on top of which is the

00:29:29.574 --> 00:29:30.920
weather station.
 

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.914
And this has long been the site
of national and international

00:29:35.914 --> 00:29:38.078
ski racing competitions.
 

00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:40.990
And there was a very curious
debate about this,

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.808
because this is on Adirondack
Forest Preserve land,

00:29:43.808 --> 00:29:46.759
and this facility was not
allowed to be built until the

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:49.382
Legislature passed on two
successive occasions an

00:29:49.382 --> 00:29:52.059
amendment to the New York State
Constitution.

00:29:52.059 --> 00:29:53.259
It's quite interesting.
 

00:29:53.259 --> 00:29:55.911
So that no development,
remember, could be built on

00:29:55.911 --> 00:29:58.773
Forest Preserve Lands unless
there was a Constitutional

00:29:58.773 --> 00:30:01.848
amendment that required those
two successive actions on the

00:30:01.848 --> 00:30:03.440
part of the Legislature.
 

00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:05.260
So they did this,
but they also constrained the

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.410
trail width to eighty feet.
 

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:09.086
Well, the International Olympic
Committee said,

00:30:09.086 --> 00:30:12.634
"We can't have a downhill
ski race on a trail that's only

00:30:12.634 --> 00:30:14.088
eighty feet in width.
 

00:30:14.088 --> 00:30:16.759
Our racers are likely to go
speeds of eighty,

00:30:16.759 --> 00:30:20.160
ninety, a hundred miles an hour
in the steepest areas.

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.038
We've got to do something about
that.

00:30:22.038 --> 00:30:25.650
We want to cut swaths in the
landscape that are--

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.869
" In one case,
they wanted to cut one that was

00:30:27.869 --> 00:30:30.490
about a hundred yards in width
in the argument of safety.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:34.252
Well, the eventual solution was
"No, you can't cut the

00:30:34.252 --> 00:30:37.303
trails up to that level,
because that would be a

00:30:37.303 --> 00:30:39.509
violation of the Constitution.
 

00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:41.794
But instead,
you can install netting on the

00:30:41.794 --> 00:30:45.220
sides of the trails so that if
the skiers go out of control,

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.144
they'll become entangled in the
nets and they won't hit the

00:30:47.144 --> 00:30:47.608
trees."
 

00:30:47.608 --> 00:30:50.209
Kind of a very interesting
debate between the

00:30:50.209 --> 00:30:53.221
environmentalists on the one
hand and those that are

00:30:53.221 --> 00:30:56.529
promoting the value of the
Olympics and the international

00:30:56.529 --> 00:30:59.779
camaraderie and good spirits
that it generates and those

00:30:59.779 --> 00:31:03.558
concerned about the health and
safety of the ski racers.

00:31:03.558 --> 00:31:09.961
Another facility that I had the
opportunity to manage the permit

00:31:09.961 --> 00:31:14.130
issuance for was the ski jump
facility.

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.470
I don't know,
are any of you ski jumpers?

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:18.130
Probably not here.
 

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:21.919
But when I taught at Dartmouth,
I had a number of ski jumpers

00:31:21.919 --> 00:31:22.930
in my classes.
 

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.990
And these facilities are-- it's
a ninety-meter ski jump,

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.048
meaning that if you take off
from the end,

00:31:30.048 --> 00:31:33.009
the maximum flight distance,
safe flight distance,

00:31:33.009 --> 00:31:34.960
is roughly ninety meters.
 

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.140
And then the seventy-meter jump
is next to it.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.376
And these were highly contested
because they are the tallest

00:31:40.376 --> 00:31:43.450
structures now between Albany,
New York, and Montreal.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.963
And they lie immediately
adjacent to the High Peaks

00:31:45.963 --> 00:31:46.868
Wilderness Area.
 

00:31:46.868 --> 00:31:49.625
So the question posed to the
Park Agency was:

00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:53.385
What kind of effect would these
towers have on the wilderness

00:31:53.385 --> 00:31:55.828
character of the High Peaks
region?

00:31:55.828 --> 00:31:59.288
And the Olympic organizing
committee loved the idea.

00:31:59.288 --> 00:32:03.137
They thought that these towers
would become symbolic of Lake

00:32:03.137 --> 00:32:06.987
Placid and the Adirondacks being
a winter sports capital and

00:32:06.987 --> 00:32:09.140
training site for the nation.
 

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:12.920
But the environmentalists
threatened to sue.

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.954
They argued that this should
not be allowed,

00:32:15.954 --> 00:32:20.192
that it is a clear intrusion
into the wilderness character of

00:32:20.192 --> 00:32:21.108
the area.
 

00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:25.034
Eventually, the State of New
York decided that these towers

00:32:25.034 --> 00:32:27.576
should be built,
rather obviously,

00:32:27.576 --> 00:32:31.048
and that despite the
requirement of the National

00:32:31.048 --> 00:32:35.335
Environmental Policy Act that
demands that whenever federal

00:32:35.335 --> 00:32:39.547
funds are being expended that
alternative sites have to be

00:32:39.547 --> 00:32:40.730
explored.
 

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:43.974
So that in this case that
meant, well, could you find an

00:32:43.974 --> 00:32:47.338
alternative site where you
didn't have to build a 350-foot

00:32:47.338 --> 00:32:47.930
tower?
 

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:50.108
And the answer was yes.
 

00:32:50.108 --> 00:32:53.231
Several alternatives existed
that would even be lower in

00:32:53.231 --> 00:32:53.630
cost.
 

00:32:53.630 --> 00:32:59.173
And here's an example from
Europe of how many European

00:32:59.173 --> 00:33:03.880
communities such as
Garmisch-Partenkirchen and

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:09.109
Innsbruck and the jumps in
Sweden and Norway,

00:33:09.109 --> 00:33:10.390
they're built into the hillside.
 

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:13.421
So basically the problem is,
it's an engineering problem of

00:33:13.421 --> 00:33:13.838
sorts.
 

00:33:13.838 --> 00:33:17.181
You know that you have a very
specific profile that is

00:33:17.181 --> 00:33:21.214
necessary in the jump design and
you also have a specific profile

00:33:21.214 --> 00:33:23.798
in the landing hill that is
required.

00:33:23.798 --> 00:33:27.761
It has to be precise,
otherwise the jumpers are in

00:33:27.761 --> 00:33:28.490
danger.
 

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:29.868
Also, they need to point north.
 

00:33:29.868 --> 00:33:33.338
Because if the sun comes down
and beats on the track,

00:33:33.338 --> 00:33:37.223
it can change the consistency
of the snow on the in run and

00:33:37.223 --> 00:33:41.509
make it unfair for say a jumper
that's going later in the day.

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:45.165
They also have to point in a
direction that is opposite of

00:33:45.165 --> 00:33:48.286
prevailing winds,
because when a jumper goes off

00:33:48.286 --> 00:33:50.333
the jump,
you don't want them blowing

00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:50.740
around.
 

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:53.710
So that they have very specific
site design criteria.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:56.400
However, when one was found in
Lake Placid, the National

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.846
Environmental Policy Act
demanded that that site be

00:33:58.846 --> 00:33:59.578
considered.
 

00:33:59.578 --> 00:34:03.009
And it was eventually rejected
by the State of New York,

00:34:03.009 --> 00:34:05.940
which resulted in the building
of that tower.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:10.644
Now one additional example of
an intrusion into wilderness

00:34:10.644 --> 00:34:13.699
that was being proposed was the
Mt.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.239
Van Hoevenberg cross-country
ski run.

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.860
And this is now a terrific run.
 

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:24.751
And they have fifty kilometer
races that are held in the

00:34:24.751 --> 00:34:25.929
Olympics.
 

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:29.699
And when this was proposed,
people thought,

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:33.422
well these trails really don't
need to be anything perhaps

00:34:33.422 --> 00:34:36.949
wider than this table on the top
of the podium here.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:41.579
And it turned out that they had
to be quite a bit wider.

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:45.009
They needed motorized vehicles
that could move through and they

00:34:45.009 --> 00:34:48.382
could plough the snow up the way
that a snowcat would at a ski

00:34:48.382 --> 00:34:52.090
area and that set a track behind
them for the racers to follow.

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:55.996
So the question became well,
should we allow motorized

00:34:55.996 --> 00:35:00.273
access in wilderness areas to
facilitate the development of

00:35:00.273 --> 00:35:01.599
this facility?
 

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.789
And the answer was no.
 

00:35:02.789 --> 00:35:06.273
The government,
the State of New York decided

00:35:06.273 --> 00:35:09.432
that instead,
there was an adjacent tract of

00:35:09.432 --> 00:35:13.282
land that could easily be used
and they would even have to use

00:35:13.282 --> 00:35:16.817
less land area and cut down
fewer trees if they would use

00:35:16.817 --> 00:35:20.730
bridges the way that many of the
European communities that have

00:35:20.730 --> 00:35:24.327
these facilities have done that
cross the trails so that a

00:35:24.327 --> 00:35:27.672
wooden bridge crosses the trail
so that you don't have

00:35:27.672 --> 00:35:30.639
interference as the race
progresses.

00:35:30.639 --> 00:35:34.284
Wilderness often creates
additional debates about the

00:35:34.284 --> 00:35:37.650
kind of interior management that
should occur.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:40.762
Should you have facilities on
the interior such as a ranger

00:35:40.762 --> 00:35:41.300
station?
 

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.739
Should a ranger live on the
interior?

00:35:43.739 --> 00:35:46.530
Or should the rangers be roving
through the area?

00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:49.704
Very interesting questions
related to emergency response

00:35:49.704 --> 00:35:50.110
time.
 

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:54.614
And the access by helicopter
obviously reduces that response

00:35:54.614 --> 00:35:55.150
time.
 

00:35:55.150 --> 00:36:00.320
And the advent of wireless
communications makes it much

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:05.110
easier to get injured people out
of these areas.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:07.648
But every year,
several people will die in the

00:36:07.648 --> 00:36:10.018
Adirondacks in the middle of the
winter.

00:36:10.018 --> 00:36:13.945
It's famous for its storms
where they start out at say

00:36:13.945 --> 00:36:16.909
thirty-seven degrees and it's
raining.

00:36:16.909 --> 00:36:21.210
And then by maybe eight or ten
hours later, the temperature

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:23.139
drops to ten below zero.
 

00:36:23.139 --> 00:36:27.065
So people first get frozen--
they first get cold and then

00:36:27.065 --> 00:36:28.889
they become hypothermic.
 

00:36:28.889 --> 00:36:32.030
So that response time is really
an important issue.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:34.824
Within the Adirondacks,
they decided to remove the

00:36:34.824 --> 00:36:38.804
ranger cabins from the interior,
and instead hire more rangers

00:36:38.804 --> 00:36:42.295
that would have more
requirements for patrolling the

00:36:42.295 --> 00:36:43.460
interior area.
 

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:48.373
Kind of an interesting tradeoff
between response time and the

00:36:48.373 --> 00:36:51.239
wilderness character of the
area.

00:36:51.239 --> 00:36:55.152
Also really interesting debates
about how to manage fire in wild

00:36:55.152 --> 00:36:55.650
lands.
 

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.800
And these vary agency to agency.
 

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:02.739
So the Forest Service has a
very different policy toward

00:37:02.739 --> 00:37:06.750
managing fires than the National
Park Service has had.

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.952
And this was very apparent in
the enormous Yellowstone

00:37:10.952 --> 00:37:15.789
National Park fires that burned
tens of thousands of acres.

00:37:15.789 --> 00:37:19.630
So imagine the National Park
Service lying next to U.S.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.016
Forest Service land,
and the Park Service has a

00:37:22.016 --> 00:37:22.900
no-burn policy.
 

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.009
Let nature take its course,
lightning strikes,

00:37:26.009 --> 00:37:29.255
the fire starts,
and we're not going to suppress

00:37:29.255 --> 00:37:29.739
it.
 

00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:33.027
So what that meant to the
Forest Service was that their

00:37:33.027 --> 00:37:36.010
timber leases were quite
vulnerable and the timber

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.905
companies were claiming they had
private property rights to those

00:37:39.905 --> 00:37:43.557
timber and the government had an
obligation to ensure that it

00:37:43.557 --> 00:37:47.088
fought forest fires to the best
of their ability to protect

00:37:47.088 --> 00:37:48.489
their rights.
 

00:37:48.489 --> 00:37:53.166
So very interesting conflicts
over attitudes about how to

00:37:53.166 --> 00:37:56.922
manage wilderness,
how to manage nature in its

00:37:56.922 --> 00:37:58.260
wilder form.
 

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.976
And once you permit a commodity
such as a timber right or a

00:38:03.976 --> 00:38:08.610
hunting right or a mineral
extraction right,

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:11.300
then in a way,
government becomes obligated to

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.945
ensure continued access to the
corporation to get those rights

00:38:14.945 --> 00:38:16.679
out of the public domain.
 

00:38:16.679 --> 00:38:20.780
I'd like you to think about a
couple of other ideas about

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:22.099
property rights.
 

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:26.233
And we're almost running out of
time, and I'm going to give you

00:38:26.233 --> 00:38:30.500
just this one example here of
development in the coastal zone.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:35.327
This is a tract of land that
lies between Los Angeles and San

00:38:35.327 --> 00:38:37.179
Diego on the Pacific.
 

00:38:37.179 --> 00:38:42.059
And here you see basically a
planned unit development area

00:38:42.059 --> 00:38:47.197
where you have gated communities
in the hills overlooking the

00:38:47.197 --> 00:38:50.141
Pacific,
and they basically ran out of

00:38:50.141 --> 00:38:50.518
land.
 

00:38:50.518 --> 00:38:54.592
So you can imagine if you've
got a town and you lay a grid

00:38:54.592 --> 00:38:58.449
over it that is one-acre zoning
in the entire town,

00:38:58.449 --> 00:39:01.307
eventually, you're going to
have one house on every one of

00:39:01.307 --> 00:39:02.010
those acres.
 

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:05.007
And that is then thought of as
the concept of build out,

00:39:05.007 --> 00:39:06.590
a town is at its build out.
 

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.929
So if that is the case,
then what are you going to do?

00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:11.094
I mean, I suppose you could
allow people,

00:39:11.094 --> 00:39:13.961
through a variance to a zoning
ordinance, to build up,

00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:15.639
to build higher structures.
 

00:39:15.639 --> 00:39:18.550
But in this case,
they granted the developer the

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.159
right to build a marina.
 

00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:22.420
Now, a marina, what's a marina?
 

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.909
Well this is some marina.
 

00:39:23.909 --> 00:39:27.230
This marina has hundreds and
hundreds of berths.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:29.039
And these boats are not minor
boats.

00:39:29.039 --> 00:39:33.648
And you can think about this
one community and think about

00:39:33.648 --> 00:39:34.780
the process.
 

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.724
The developer goes to the State
of California because the

00:39:37.724 --> 00:39:40.300
California Coastal Commission
has jurisdiction.

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.590
It goes to the town of Dana
Point.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:46.802
It eventually has to go to the
Coast Guard and to a variety of

00:39:46.802 --> 00:39:50.670
other federal agencies to get
permits to develop this.

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:54.728
But once they do that,
it creates an enormously

00:39:54.728 --> 00:39:56.670
profitable business.
 

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:00.516
Not only do these people have
to pay slip fees,

00:40:00.516 --> 00:40:05.451
but they have to pay fees for
having their sewage pumped out

00:40:05.451 --> 00:40:07.039
of their boats.
 

00:40:07.039 --> 00:40:12.489
The town put up recreational
opportunities that the users

00:40:12.489 --> 00:40:13.949
will pay for.
 

00:40:13.949 --> 00:40:17.824
And the tax revenues to the
community are in the millions of

00:40:17.824 --> 00:40:21.503
dollars per year because the
community is able to tax the

00:40:21.503 --> 00:40:22.949
value of the boat.
 

00:40:22.949 --> 00:40:27.070
Some of these boats are forty,
fifty, seventy feet in length.

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.623
So that the average estimate of
real estate value,

00:40:30.623 --> 00:40:34.974
the boats are always changing
depending upon who buys a lease

00:40:34.974 --> 00:40:36.280
to the berths.
 

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.173
But about $250,000,000 in
increased real estate value was

00:40:41.173 --> 00:40:45.369
created out of what was formerly
public land,

00:40:45.369 --> 00:40:48.829
common land owned and managed
by the State of California.

00:40:48.829 --> 00:40:53.409
So I'm going to leave you just
with a thought that managing

00:40:53.409 --> 00:40:57.751
land is all about managing
property rights and conflicts

00:40:57.751 --> 00:41:01.619
over access to scarce and
valuable resources.

00:41:01.619 --> 00:41:05.103
And the Adirondacks provides I
think one pretty interesting

00:41:05.103 --> 00:41:07.987
example of that because of the
complexity of land

00:41:07.987 --> 00:41:10.268
classifications that were
created.

00:41:10.268 --> 00:41:14.144
I tend to think of the
Adirondacks as having

00:41:14.144 --> 00:41:19.012
dramatically shifted my
perception of the potential for

00:41:19.012 --> 00:41:23.518
us on earth any longer to
experience wildness.

00:41:23.518 --> 00:41:27.420
My idea of wildness is not what
it was when I worked there.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:30.123
I had no understanding of the
chemical dimension of the

00:41:30.123 --> 00:41:33.079
Adirondacks and how humans have
changed the chemistry of the

00:41:33.079 --> 00:41:33.530
park.
 

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.447
That also raises a very
interesting question about

00:41:36.447 --> 00:41:37.460
climate change.
 

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.905
So that Melinda Smith,
a professor in ecology and

00:41:40.905 --> 00:41:45.085
evolutionary biology,
gave a very interesting lecture

00:41:45.085 --> 00:41:49.679
yesterday about the influence of
increasing temperature and

00:41:49.679 --> 00:41:53.719
changes in moisture on the
future of grasslands.

00:41:53.719 --> 00:41:57.273
And she argued that well,
three percent of the world's

00:41:57.273 --> 00:42:01.699
grasslands are now in protected
area status, only three percent.

00:42:01.699 --> 00:42:05.039
However, changes in the
humidity, changes in the

00:42:05.039 --> 00:42:08.806
temperature are causing
reductions in productivity and

00:42:08.806 --> 00:42:13.070
changes in biological diversity
that were never imagined when

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:16.324
these legal regimes,
such as the Adirondack Park

00:42:16.324 --> 00:42:17.929
Agency,
were created.

00:42:17.929 --> 00:42:20.139
Now in the Adirondacks,
you've got also changes in

00:42:20.139 --> 00:42:22.889
temperature and you've got
changes in biological diversity.

00:42:22.889 --> 00:42:27.050
And what that means is that the
approach to managing these

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:30.702
property rights has been
insufficient to manage the

00:42:30.702 --> 00:42:34.280
ecological change that it's now
experiencing.

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:38.561
So it's dramatically shifting
my perception of what the future

00:42:38.561 --> 00:42:42.702
of a park and protected area
should be as ecological systems

00:42:42.702 --> 00:42:46.141
and habitats are literally
migrating through these

00:42:46.141 --> 00:42:49.090
different parks and protected
areas.

00:42:49.090 --> 00:42:52.610
So what this means really is
that to tackle,

00:42:52.610 --> 00:42:56.376
if we had the objective of
managing biological diversity in

00:42:56.376 --> 00:43:00.014
parks that we really need to
think more closely about its

00:43:00.014 --> 00:43:01.768
link to climate change.
 

00:43:01.768 --> 00:43:05.329
So that a regulatory regime
that manages climate is really

00:43:05.329 --> 00:43:08.327
essentially for long-term
effective management of

00:43:08.327 --> 00:43:09.889
biological diversity.
 

00:43:09.889 --> 00:43:12.219
So, that's it for today.
 

00:43:12.219 --> 00:43:13.699
Have a great weekend.
 

00:43:13.699 --> 00:43:20.000

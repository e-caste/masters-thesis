00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.457
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Last time, we were discussing

00:00:03.457 --> 00:00:06.197
the rationality of suicide.
We separated the question of

00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:09.393
the rationality of suicide from
the ethics of suicide or the

00:00:09.393 --> 00:00:12.254
morality of suicide.
We'll be turning to the

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:15.880
morality of suicide later today.
But the first question in

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.131
thinking about the rationality
of suicide was whether or not it

00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:22.225
could actually be the case that
somebody would be better off

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:23.596
dead.
Having argued that,

00:00:23.596 --> 00:00:26.270
at least on what struck me as
the more plausible theory is,

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.386
that was a possibility,
we then turned to the question

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:33.112
of under what circumstances,
more particularly--or perhaps

00:00:33.112 --> 00:00:36.901
the better way to put it,
at what point--would it be true

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:40.706
that suicide might be rational?"
In tackling the question,

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:44.038
we were initially bracketing
the question about whether you

00:00:44.038 --> 00:00:46.854
could ever reasonably or
rationally judge that the

00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:50.320
circumstances actually obtained.
We'll turn to that question in

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.576
a few minutes.
The question we were focusing

00:00:52.576 --> 00:00:55.640
on originally was just,
from the objective perspective,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.889
as it were, what does the graph
need to look like in order for

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:03.930
it to be the case that you'd be
better off dead and suicide

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.653
would be a rational choice?
I drew a variety of different

00:01:07.653 --> 00:01:11.049
graphs, different lines about
your life doing better or worse,

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:14.040
and noted for each one of them,
at what point,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.230
if ever, suicide might be a
reasonable choice.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.506
I want to draw a couple of more
graphs before ending this bit of

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:26.190
the discussion.
You'll recall the axes.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.844
The x axis represents time.
The y axis represents how good

00:01:31.844 --> 00:01:36.583
or bad your life is overall,
taking into account the value

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:39.671
of being alive,
per se, if you accept a

00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:42.791
valuable container theory.
The higher the line,

00:01:42.791 --> 00:01:45.170
the better your life is at that
time.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.599
The lower the line,
the worse your life is at that

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:50.093
time.
You might say,

00:01:50.093 --> 00:01:53.246
the easy cases,
at least in the philosophical

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.041
point of view,
are ones where things get

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:58.451
worse.
Eventually, your life becomes

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.870
worse than nothing.
You'd be better off dead.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.976
And it's going to stay that way
until such time as you might die

00:02:05.976 --> 00:02:09.159
from natural causes.
Dying from natural causes.

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:13.381
In a situation like this,
killing yourself from here on

00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:16.682
out would make sense,
assuming you knew the facts,

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:19.419
could trust your judgment,
and so forth and so on.

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:23.729
Some of the issues that we'll
come back to in a minute.

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:26.155
And indeed, as we saw,
there will be even cases in

00:02:26.155 --> 00:02:28.780
which it might make sense to
kill yourself earlier,

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.947
if this was the last chance at
which you had the ability to

00:02:32.947 --> 00:02:36.208
kill yourself or not,
even though you'd be giving up

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:39.533
some life that was worth living,
that was the only way to avoid

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:42.590
a much larger chunk of life that
was not worth living.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.210
So, suicide might still make
sense.

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.069
On the other hand,
if the choice was way back

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.035
here, although this is--killing
yourself early on would be the

00:02:52.035 --> 00:02:55.610
only way to avoid the later
chunk not worth living,

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:00.074
at least if that chunk's small
enough--suppose it was like

00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:04.616
this--you'd say it doesn't make
sense to kill yourself this

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:06.702
early.
You'd be throwing away too

00:03:06.702 --> 00:03:09.810
much, even though that's the
only way to avoid the bad stuff.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.551
Now, as I say,
that's the easy graph,

00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:16.815
where you go from a life worth
living to a life not worth

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:20.613
living and it stays there.
But suppose instead,

00:03:20.613 --> 00:03:22.960
we have a situation like this.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.608
Here, life becomes worse than
nothing for a while,

00:03:31.608 --> 00:03:36.759
but you recover.
You're going to return to a

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:42.169
life that's worth having.
And suppose that after you

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:47.750
recover, you'll have a very nice
third stage, third act of your

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.509
life before you would eventually
die of natural causes or natural

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:56.034
death.
Here, the crucial point to

00:03:56.034 --> 00:03:58.808
make, of course,
is that even though for a while

00:03:58.808 --> 00:04:01.169
your life will be worse than
nothing,

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.277
negative overall,
it doesn't mean that it makes

00:04:05.277 --> 00:04:08.759
sense to kill yourself at this
point.

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.677
Because, of course,
although it's true that if you

00:04:11.677 --> 00:04:14.714
do kill yourself here,
you're avoiding this negative

00:04:14.714 --> 00:04:17.630
chunk,
this bit below the x axis,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.163
doing that also throws away the
very large third act where your

00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:27.180
life returns to being better
than nothing.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.198
Since the choices have neither
of these, or both,

00:04:31.198 --> 00:04:35.970
and the positive third act is
great enough to outweigh the

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.631
negative second act,
on balance, it doesn't make

00:04:39.631 --> 00:04:41.084
sense.
But of course--,

00:04:41.084 --> 00:04:44.923
So even though your life might
be worse than nothing for some

00:04:44.923 --> 00:04:48.124
stretch, suicide wouldn't
necessarily be a rational

00:04:48.124 --> 00:04:50.796
decision.
But it's crucial in making that

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:54.120
argument, that the--what I've
been calling the third act.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.168
Here's act one,
here's act two,

00:04:57.168 --> 00:05:00.598
here's act three.
It's crucial in making this

00:05:00.598 --> 00:05:03.649
argument is that the third act
was sufficiently great,

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:07.450
sufficiently long and
sufficiently high that it

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.589
outweighs the bad of the second
act.

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:13.631
And although that's true the
way I've drawn the graph,

00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.500
we could imagine that it wasn't
quite like that.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.960
Suppose that after the second
act, in which your life is not

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.852
worth living,
you will recover and have a

00:05:29.852 --> 00:05:34.717
third act in which life once
again is good for you,

00:05:34.717 --> 00:05:37.394
overall.
Still at this point,

00:05:37.394 --> 00:05:39.759
act three doesn't outweigh act
two.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:43.546
Although there's a recovery,
it's too short and not high

00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:46.300
enough to outweigh the bad of
act two.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.585
And so, under that
circumstance,

00:05:48.585 --> 00:05:52.049
when you ask yourself,
let's say at this moment,

00:05:52.049 --> 00:05:57.279
would suicide here be rational?
the answer could well be "yes."

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.408
Although in killing yourself
you've given up act three,

00:06:00.408 --> 00:06:02.610
which would be good for you
overall,

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.859
doing that's the only way to
avoid act two,

00:06:05.859 --> 00:06:09.882
which is bad for you overall,
and sufficiently bad to

00:06:09.882 --> 00:06:15.638
outweigh the good of act three.
So, if you've got the choice of

00:06:15.638 --> 00:06:19.670
suicide here,
it might well be rational.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:21.761
Notice however,
that the crucial point,

00:06:21.761 --> 00:06:25.064
again, is when are we
talking about the possibility of

00:06:25.064 --> 00:06:29.666
committing suicide?
Committing suicide here might

00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:35.533
be rational, but not
necessarily, indeed not at all,

00:06:35.533 --> 00:06:40.571
at this later moment.
Because at this point,

00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:44.449
the fact that you've gone
through act two is now history.

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:45.940
There's nothing you can do
about it.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:51.519
You've had this horrible period
of your life and now it's over.

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:53.850
Your question is not,
can you avoid act two?

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:57.104
It's too late for that.
You're simply asking yourself,

00:06:57.104 --> 00:06:58.870
what do I think about act
three?

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.920
Should I avoid act three?
And that doesn't make sense.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.590
We've stipulated that act three
is good for you overall.

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:13.804
So here, suicide no longer
makes sense, even though it

00:07:13.804 --> 00:07:19.917
would have made sense over here.
The interesting point is that

00:07:19.917 --> 00:07:25.453
these possibilities are not mere
theoretical possibilities,

00:07:25.453 --> 00:07:29.928
but actually can happen.
There's a famous case of,

00:07:29.928 --> 00:07:34.028
in the bioethics literature,
of somebody who suffered a

00:07:34.028 --> 00:07:38.584
horrible set of burns over a
great deal of their body and had

00:07:38.584 --> 00:07:42.063
to go through a period,
a very long period,

00:07:42.063 --> 00:07:45.125
of recovery in which they were
hospitalized,

00:07:45.125 --> 00:07:48.899
basically immobilized and in a
great deal of pain,

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:53.644
while their nerves regenerated
and their skin regrafted and the

00:07:53.644 --> 00:07:57.184
like.
And early on in that period,

00:07:57.184 --> 00:08:02.228
this person said,
although he believed that he'd

00:08:02.228 --> 00:08:06.752
eventually recover,
what he was going to have to go

00:08:06.752 --> 00:08:10.449
through was so horrible that he
wished he were dead.

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:12.970
Because of the nature of his
hospitalization,

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:17.123
he wasn't able to kill himself.
He asked that he be killed and

00:08:17.123 --> 00:08:20.157
people refused.
He went through a period and

00:08:20.157 --> 00:08:23.699
sure enough, he recovered.
And eventually, he said, "Yes.

00:08:23.699 --> 00:08:27.300
Now my life is worth living
again.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:30.026
And of course,
since it is worth living,

00:08:30.026 --> 00:08:34.012
now that I'm able to kill
myself, it no longer makes sense

00:08:34.012 --> 00:08:37.266
for me to kill myself.
Because here I am," as he might

00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:39.490
put it, "in act three with a
life worth living.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.132
But for all that,
even though I now have a life

00:08:43.132 --> 00:08:46.379
worth living,
I haven't changed my opinion

00:08:46.379 --> 00:08:50.893
that it would have been better
for me back here toward the

00:08:50.893 --> 00:08:55.170
beginning of act two for me to
have been killed,

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:59.293
or for me to have died.
It remains the case that I wish

00:08:59.293 --> 00:09:02.620
I had died here,
so as to avoid all the pain and

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.716
suffering,
even though I'm now in a period

00:09:06.716 --> 00:09:11.430
which is better for me,
good for me overall."

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.644
All right. One other case.
This is just repeating a point

00:09:15.644 --> 00:09:17.810
that actually I made very early
on.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.697
In all of these cases where
I've argued for the rationality

00:09:27.697 --> 00:09:31.493
of suicide, it's because
eventually the line has dipped

00:09:31.493 --> 00:09:36.159
below the x axis.
The crucial point to remember

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:42.429
is, even if your situation
deteriorates and indeed doesn't

00:09:42.429 --> 00:09:48.259
recover, that still doesn't make
suicide rational.

00:09:48.259 --> 00:09:52.933
The question is not,
am I worse off than I had been

00:09:52.933 --> 00:09:57.980
or than I might have been had I
not had the decline?

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.951
The question in thinking about
the rationality of suicide is,

00:10:02.951 --> 00:10:06.679
am I so badly off that I'm
better off dead?

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:10.990
And if your life is a
sufficiently rich and valuable

00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:15.299
one, there's a great deal of
room for going down,

00:10:15.299 --> 00:10:19.163
having a worse life,
while still ending up at a life

00:10:19.163 --> 00:10:21.884
better than nothing.
In that case,

00:10:21.884 --> 00:10:25.289
of course, suicide's not
rational at all.

00:10:25.289 --> 00:10:30.148
Still, it does seem to me that
there are cases in which the

00:10:30.148 --> 00:10:34.588
line does cut below the x axis
and remains there for a

00:10:34.588 --> 00:10:38.906
sufficiently long time,
perhaps remains there forever,

00:10:38.906 --> 00:10:41.580
so that the person is better
off dead.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.901
And so we might say,
from that point of view,

00:10:44.901 --> 00:10:49.129
if only the person could
recognize the facts and know for

00:10:49.129 --> 00:10:53.809
a certainty that's what their
line was going to look like,

00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:58.940
suicide would at certain points
be rational.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:05.235
Still, that means we need to
turn to the second part of the

00:11:05.235 --> 00:11:09.055
question.
Somebody who believes suicide

00:11:09.055 --> 00:11:14.398
cannot be rational might say,
look, the whole game is in the

00:11:14.398 --> 00:11:18.182
phrase I just used.
Sure, there are situations in

00:11:18.182 --> 00:11:21.768
which if only you knew the
facts, if only you had a crystal

00:11:21.768 --> 00:11:25.539
ball and knew for a certainty
this is what my life is going to

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:29.059
go on from here on out,
then suicide would be rational.

00:11:29.059 --> 00:11:32.440
But of course,
we never have a crystal ball.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:38.086
We never have the guarantee
that this is how the line's

00:11:38.086 --> 00:11:41.793
going to go.
So, the question we need to

00:11:41.793 --> 00:11:45.615
turn to now is,
could it be rational for you to

00:11:45.615 --> 00:11:50.849
judge that your situation is one
in which the line's going to go

00:11:50.849 --> 00:11:54.606
below and stay below,
or stay below long enough,

00:11:54.606 --> 00:11:57.429
so that on balance,
you'd be better off dead?

00:11:57.429 --> 00:12:01.522
Let's suppose that somebody's
situation is like that,

00:12:01.522 --> 00:12:05.299
or at least there can be
situations like that.

00:12:05.299 --> 00:12:10.014
Could it ever be reasonable to
judge that your situation is

00:12:10.014 --> 00:12:13.033
like that?
And if so, could it ever then

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:17.049
be reasonable to act on that
judgment and end your life?

00:12:17.049 --> 00:12:19.019
We're still bracketing
questions about morality.

00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:22.659
Here we're still looking at
things from the personal,

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.942
rational perspective.
And once again,

00:12:24.942 --> 00:12:27.320
what I want to do next is
distinguish two questions.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.792
I want to distinguish between
questions about what should we

00:12:31.792 --> 00:12:36.341
say if you were thinking clearly
versus what should we say if

00:12:36.341 --> 00:12:39.956
your thinking is clouded.
Again, one might think,

00:12:39.956 --> 00:12:42.912
look, in the type of cases
where suicide might be

00:12:42.912 --> 00:12:46.009
rationally warranted,
it's going to be so stressful,

00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:49.409
that nobody can think clearly
in the middle of that situation.

00:12:49.409 --> 00:12:52.722
And so even if it were true
that you could reasonably decide

00:12:52.722 --> 00:12:55.585
to commit suicide if only you
were thinking clearly,

00:12:55.585 --> 00:12:58.775
nobody does think clearly.
Let's come back to that worry

00:12:58.775 --> 00:13:01.446
in a moment.
Let's assume for the moment

00:13:01.446 --> 00:13:05.070
that you can think clearly about
your situation.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.946
Perhaps you've got some sort of
painful disease,

00:13:07.946 --> 00:13:10.639
but the disease is not painful
constantly.

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:13.623
There are periods in which it
comes to an end,

00:13:13.623 --> 00:13:17.535
brief periods in which you're
able to assess your situation,

00:13:17.535 --> 00:13:20.854
weigh up the facts.
Could it ever be rational in

00:13:20.854 --> 00:13:23.610
that situation to decide to kill
yourself?

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:28.820
Well, as I say,
we don't have a crystal ball.

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:32.151
If you did have a crystal ball,
if you knew for a certainty

00:13:32.151 --> 00:13:35.483
that your line was so bad that
it was below zero and wasn't

00:13:35.483 --> 00:13:37.387
going to recover,
perhaps we'd say,

00:13:37.387 --> 00:13:39.398
yeah, in that case,
it would be rational to commit

00:13:39.398 --> 00:13:40.897
suicide.
But we don't have a crystal

00:13:40.897 --> 00:13:43.909
ball.
What should we say then?

00:13:43.909 --> 00:13:46.849
The critics of suicide might
come back and say,

00:13:46.849 --> 00:13:49.980
well look, since you don't have
a crystal ball,

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.779
since you never know for sure
that you won't recover,

00:13:53.779 --> 00:13:57.360
since there's always a
possibility of recovery,

00:13:57.360 --> 00:14:01.271
suicide never makes sense.
After all, we all know that

00:14:01.271 --> 00:14:04.379
there's constant progress in
medicine.

00:14:04.379 --> 00:14:07.910
People are always making
breakthroughs and what seems

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.917
like an incurable disease one
day may have some sort of cure

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:15.069
the next.
But if you killed yourself,

00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:19.440
you've thrown away any chance
of getting that cure.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:25.513
And even if medical cures don't
come around, various diseases

00:14:25.513 --> 00:14:30.169
sometimes simply have miraculous
remissions.

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:33.560
Somebody might just get better
spontaneously.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.274
That's always a possibility.
It doesn't happen very often,

00:14:36.274 --> 00:14:37.759
but it does happen now and
then.

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:42.723
And again, if you've killed
yourself, you've thrown away any

00:14:42.723 --> 00:14:46.989
chance of recovery.
So the critics of suicide might

00:14:46.989 --> 00:14:50.940
say, given that there's a
chance, however small,

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.264
of recovery,
whether through medical

00:14:53.264 --> 00:14:57.450
progress or just some sort of
medical miracle--but of course,

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.707
if you kill yourself there's no
chance of recovery--given that,

00:15:01.707 --> 00:15:05.623
it doesn't make any sense.
It can't make sense rationally

00:15:05.623 --> 00:15:08.497
to kill yourself.
That sort of position gets

00:15:08.497 --> 00:15:12.269
articulated now and again.
But I think it's got to be

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:15.166
mistaken.
It's true that we don't have a

00:15:15.166 --> 00:15:18.129
crystal ball,
and so in deciding whether to

00:15:18.129 --> 00:15:21.092
kill yourself,
what you're doing is playing

00:15:21.092 --> 00:15:25.080
the odds.
You're gambling.

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:29.149
But still, gambling is
something we do all the time.

00:15:29.149 --> 00:15:32.486
Indeed, there is no getting
away from the fact that in the

00:15:32.486 --> 00:15:35.003
suicide case,
in the case of some terminally

00:15:35.003 --> 00:15:37.448
ill patient,
or at least somebody who

00:15:37.448 --> 00:15:41.095
appears to be terminally ill,
there is no getting away from

00:15:41.095 --> 00:15:44.930
the fact that regardless of what
decision he or she makes,

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.926
they are gambling.
Gambling, playing the odds,

00:15:49.926 --> 00:15:54.022
just is one of the facts of
life about how we have to

00:15:54.022 --> 00:15:58.024
decide.
We have to make our decisions

00:15:58.024 --> 00:16:01.441
under uncertainty.
Now, suppose somebody says

00:16:01.441 --> 00:16:04.013
then, look, since we agree that
we're deciding under

00:16:04.013 --> 00:16:07.063
uncertainty,
it doesn't make sense to throw

00:16:07.063 --> 00:16:09.740
away the small chance of
recovery.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.914
Then I want to say,
that doesn't seem to be in

00:16:12.914 --> 00:16:17.146
keeping with the rules that we
would normally use in deciding

00:16:17.146 --> 00:16:21.376
how to face a gamble.
At the back of this room there

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:24.423
are two doors.
So let's tell a little fantasy,

00:16:24.423 --> 00:16:26.940
science fiction story about the
two doors.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.808
After class is over,
you're going to have to decide

00:16:29.808 --> 00:16:32.159
which one of these doors to go
through.

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:36.457
Let's suppose that if you go
through door one,

00:16:36.457 --> 00:16:42.091
it's virtually guaranteed that
what will happen is you'll be

00:16:42.091 --> 00:16:47.439
kidnapped and your kidnappers
will then torture you for a

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:51.352
week,
after which perhaps you'll be

00:16:51.352 --> 00:16:54.131
released.
Virtually certain,

00:16:54.131 --> 00:16:56.521
90% certain,
99% certain,

00:16:56.521 --> 00:17:00.924
perhaps 99.9% certain.
There's a small chance,

00:17:00.924 --> 00:17:05.420
1 in 1,000,1 in 10,000,
that you won't be kidnapped and

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:08.866
tortured.
Instead, you'll be whisked away

00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:12.418
to a wonderful,
tropical vacation where you'll

00:17:12.418 --> 00:17:15.259
have a fantastic time for a
week.

00:17:15.259 --> 00:17:17.884
Not very likely,
but not impossible,

00:17:17.884 --> 00:17:21.839
1 in 1,000;
1 in 10,000, maybe less.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.369
That's if you go through door
one.

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:27.940
Door one has 99.99% chance of a
week of torture,

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.343
and a 0.01 or 0.001,
whatever it is,

00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:35.329
percent chance of wonderful
vacation.

00:17:35.329 --> 00:17:39.160
On the other hand,
if you go through door number

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:44.049
two, 100% certainty that the
following is going to happen.

00:17:44.049 --> 00:17:47.089
You will immediately fall
asleep.

00:17:47.089 --> 00:17:51.590
You'll be in a deep,
dreamless state for the week,

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:56.020
at which point you'll wake up.
Well, what should you do?

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.484
What should you pick?
It's not quite certainty of

00:18:00.484 --> 00:18:04.009
being tortured versus certainty
of sleeping.

00:18:04.009 --> 00:18:07.299
If it was certainty of being
tortured versus certainty of

00:18:07.299 --> 00:18:10.705
sleeping, I suppose we'd all
agree the thing to do is to go

00:18:10.705 --> 00:18:14.371
through door number two.
Sleep's nothing positive,

00:18:14.371 --> 00:18:18.089
but on the other hand,
it's nothing negative.

00:18:18.089 --> 00:18:20.188
I suppose if we were going to
slap a number on it,

00:18:20.188 --> 00:18:23.332
we'd give it a zero.
But torture is clearly a

00:18:23.332 --> 00:18:26.789
negative.
And if it's a week of torture,

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:31.017
it's a very large negative.
So, it's zero versus some huge

00:18:31.017 --> 00:18:33.420
negative number.
Certainty versus certainty,

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.583
what should you pick?
We'd all agree,

00:18:35.583 --> 00:18:39.412
I presume, you should pick door
number two and pick the

00:18:39.412 --> 00:18:42.106
dreamless sleep for a week.
Now we remember,

00:18:42.106 --> 00:18:43.771
but wait a minute,
it wasn't certain that

00:18:43.771 --> 00:18:46.252
you were going to be tortured,
it was just very,

00:18:46.252 --> 00:18:50.420
very, very likely that you were
going to be tortured.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.843
And imagine if somebody says,
oh, you must go for the

00:18:53.843 --> 00:18:56.220
gold.
Go for door number one.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.836
Sure, it's overwhelming likely
that you're going to be

00:18:58.836 --> 00:19:01.438
tortured.
But there's a very small chance

00:19:01.438 --> 00:19:04.160
that you'll get this wonderful
vacation.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.652
Whereas, if you pick door
number two, you're throwing that

00:19:07.652 --> 00:19:10.689
chance away.
And so, the only rational

00:19:10.689 --> 00:19:16.008
decision must be to pick door
number one, to hold out for that

00:19:16.008 --> 00:19:19.143
chance,
no matter how small of getting

00:19:19.143 --> 00:19:23.677
that fantastic vacation.
That's the only rational

00:19:23.677 --> 00:19:26.275
decision.
If anybody were to say that,

00:19:26.275 --> 00:19:27.858
I'd laugh at them.
I'd say look,

00:19:27.858 --> 00:19:30.174
if you want to talk about,
well maybe there's room for

00:19:30.174 --> 00:19:32.009
choice either way,
it depends how great the

00:19:32.009 --> 00:19:33.670
vacation is, something like
that.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:34.839
Yeah, there's maybe room for
talk.

00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:38.890
But if you want to insist that
the only rational

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:43.164
decision must be to hold out for
the chance of a wonderful

00:19:43.164 --> 00:19:46.266
vacation,
no matter how small the

00:19:46.266 --> 00:19:51.720
odds--given that if you don't
get that wonderful vacation,

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.757
you're going to be tortured and
you could avoid all that by

00:19:54.757 --> 00:19:57.899
picking the sleep option--if
somebody insisted in the face of

00:19:57.899 --> 00:20:00.506
all that,
that the only rational decision

00:20:00.506 --> 00:20:04.234
is to go through the door which
is likely to be torture and a

00:20:04.234 --> 00:20:06.720
vanishingly small chance of
vacation,

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.012
I'd say they're just wrong.
That's not a rationally

00:20:12.012 --> 00:20:16.400
required decision,
given the odds.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:27.665
Yes, question?
Student: [inaudible]

00:20:27.665 --> 00:20:42.030
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Great.

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:44.313
So, the question was this.
The point was,

00:20:44.313 --> 00:20:47.639
perhaps I'm cheating in making
the example this way,

00:20:47.639 --> 00:20:50.254
because death of course,
isn't--of course,

00:20:50.254 --> 00:20:53.167
what you're all supposed to be
lulled into thinking is that

00:20:53.167 --> 00:20:54.281
death,
choosing death,

00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:56.354
choosing suicide,
is sort of like choosing to be

00:20:56.354 --> 00:20:58.030
asleep, a state of dreamless
sleep,

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:02.697
but sleep nonetheless.
And the suggestion then was I'm

00:21:02.697 --> 00:21:04.819
cheating, because death is
forever.

00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:08.645
I deliberately framed the
example in terms of being

00:21:08.645 --> 00:21:12.700
tortured for a week versus being
asleep for a week.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:16.814
And perhaps given that choice,
it's clearly rationally

00:21:16.814 --> 00:21:21.705
acceptable to decide that you'd
rather pick the sleep for a week

00:21:21.705 --> 00:21:24.190
option.
But death isn't just for a week.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.630
If you commit suicide,
you're dead forever.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:32.217
So, let's change the example.
Suppose that--you guys are

00:21:32.217 --> 00:21:35.191
mostly, I suppose,
in the vicinity of 20--s,uppose

00:21:35.191 --> 00:21:37.740
that if you go through door
number one,

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.575
there's an overwhelmingly
likely chance,

00:21:41.575 --> 00:21:46.491
90%, 99%, 99.9% chance that
you'll be kidnapped and

00:21:46.491 --> 00:21:50.938
tortured.
And the torture will take place

00:21:50.938 --> 00:21:56.559
and last for another 50,60,
70 years and then you die.

00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:59.995
There's a slight chance,
a 10^(th) of a percent,

00:21:59.995 --> 00:22:02.480
a 100^(th) of a percent that
no,

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.139
no, you won't be tortured for
the 50,60, 70 years,

00:22:05.139 --> 00:22:07.147
but instead,
you'll be brought to this

00:22:07.147 --> 00:22:10.457
tropical island paradise where
you'll have this great time for

00:22:10.457 --> 00:22:15.101
the next 50 years.
But what has happened in 99 out

00:22:15.101 --> 00:22:19.305
of 100 cases,
or 999 out of 1,000 cases,

00:22:19.305 --> 00:22:25.450
or 9,999 out of 10,000 cases,
is the torture scenario.

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.770
While the people are being
tortured, they beg for mercy.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.480
They beg to be put to death.
The wish they were dead.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.603
It is truly the case that the
tortures are so bad that these

00:22:35.603 --> 00:22:39.181
people are better off dead.
Remember, we're assuming that

00:22:39.181 --> 00:22:42.229
you've got a case where you
really will be better off dead

00:22:42.229 --> 00:22:44.690
unless the miraculous recovery
takes place.

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.534
And so again,
we have to ask,

00:22:46.534 --> 00:22:50.487
in a situation like that where
the person says--And similarly

00:22:50.487 --> 00:22:52.572
of course,
if you go through door number

00:22:52.572 --> 00:22:54.737
two, you immediately fall
asleep, and you stay that way

00:22:54.737 --> 00:22:59.906
for the next 70 years,
and then you die while in your

00:22:59.906 --> 00:23:02.738
coma.
The fan of door number one

00:23:02.738 --> 00:23:07.119
comes along and says the only
rational decision is to pick

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:10.678
door number one,
where it's overwhelmingly

00:23:10.678 --> 00:23:16.220
likely that you face 50 years or
60 years or 70 years of torture.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:18.386
Because, of course,
if you were to pick door number

00:23:18.386 --> 00:23:21.029
two, you're throwing away your
chance, no matter how small.

00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:23.808
You're throwing away the only
chance you have of the wonderful

00:23:23.808 --> 00:23:26.279
vacation.
Well, each of us has to decide

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:29.736
for themselves.
But when I think about this

00:23:29.736 --> 00:23:34.460
case, this modified case,
I still want to say choosing

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:39.630
door number two could be a
perfectly rational decision.

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:45.806
It's just not right to say the
only rational decision is

00:23:45.806 --> 00:23:49.295
door number one.
Again, if somebody wanted to

00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:53.108
take a more modest position and
say, it depends on how great the

00:23:53.108 --> 00:23:56.733
vacation would be,
how mild the torture would be,

00:23:56.733 --> 00:24:01.361
maybe 1% chances versus a 5%
chance--there's room for debate

00:24:01.361 --> 00:24:05.989
about when might the balance
come closer to even so it would

00:24:05.989 --> 00:24:08.970
be reasonable to take the
chance.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.392
Yeah, there's room for debate.
But if the chances are small

00:24:12.392 --> 00:24:15.928
enough and the person insists
nonetheless, no matter how small

00:24:15.928 --> 00:24:19.168
the chances are,
it could never be rational to

00:24:19.168 --> 00:24:22.708
pick door number two,
I can only say that doesn't

00:24:22.708 --> 00:24:26.691
seem to be the way we would
normally think about making

00:24:26.691 --> 00:24:28.319
choices.
And of course,

00:24:28.319 --> 00:24:30.326
at this point,
you can see how the argument

00:24:30.326 --> 00:24:33.697
exactly carries over to suicide.
If you kill yourself,

00:24:33.697 --> 00:24:37.980
you're throwing away forever
any chance of recovery.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.160
And that's important and that's
worth thinking about.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:44.222
But it's also important to
think about what was the chance

00:24:44.222 --> 00:24:47.292
of recovery?
How large, or more to the

00:24:47.292 --> 00:24:52.755
point, just how small?
And how badly off will you be

00:24:52.755 --> 00:24:57.281
if you don't commit suicide?
You guys are 20,

00:24:57.281 --> 00:24:59.769
but of course,
these sorts of choices also

00:24:59.769 --> 00:25:03.472
perhaps get faced by people who
are considerably older and now

00:25:03.472 --> 00:25:06.690
in the final stages of some
progressive disease.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:09.431
The doctor's told them,
perhaps they're 70,

00:25:09.431 --> 00:25:12.630
that there's no significant
chance of recovery.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:16.997
Sometimes it happens,
but no more than 1 in 100 or 1

00:25:16.997 --> 00:25:20.299
in 1,000.
But if you continue alive,

00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:23.929
you will be in,
well, perhaps great pain,

00:25:23.929 --> 00:25:28.739
perhaps unable to do the
various things that give your

00:25:28.739 --> 00:25:33.190
life meaning and value.
Could it be true that it would

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:36.629
never be rational,
provided that you're thinking

00:25:36.629 --> 00:25:39.276
clearly,
never rational to say,

00:25:39.276 --> 00:25:44.583
look, the chances of something
negative are so overwhelmingly

00:25:44.583 --> 00:25:47.282
great,
that even though deciding for

00:25:47.282 --> 00:25:51.349
death throws away whatever small
chance I've got of recovery,

00:25:51.349 --> 00:25:55.026
the chance of recovery is so
small that on balance,

00:25:55.026 --> 00:25:58.996
it's reasonable to throw that
chance away and avoid the

00:25:58.996 --> 00:26:02.746
overwhelmingly likely
possibility that I'll continue

00:26:02.746 --> 00:26:06.789
in my current state with a life
not worth living?

00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:09.814
It seems that if you're
thinking clearly,

00:26:09.814 --> 00:26:13.897
there could be cases in
which suicide would be a

00:26:13.897 --> 00:26:16.959
rational choice.
But that still leaves us with

00:26:16.959 --> 00:26:19.150
the question,
well, maybe that's where all

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.415
the work needs to be done.
What about this point about

00:26:22.415 --> 00:26:24.852
thinking clearly?
Even if we grant,

00:26:24.852 --> 00:26:28.882
for the sake of argument,
that there could be cases in

00:26:28.882 --> 00:26:33.064
which the person's life is so
bad that they actually are

00:26:33.064 --> 00:26:36.410
better off dead and they stay
that way,

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:39.645
even if we grant that,
if only somebody were thinking

00:26:39.645 --> 00:26:43.130
clearly, they would see that
that was so likely to be the

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.170
case,
that suicide would be a

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:52.318
rational or reasonable choice,
still isn't it plausible to

00:26:52.318 --> 00:26:57.588
think that in real life,
people can't think clearly

00:26:57.588 --> 00:27:03.029
about their situation when
they're in situations like that?

00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:07.994
Look, it's one thing for us to
be sitting here in this

00:27:07.994 --> 00:27:13.240
classroom, where I certainly
hope that none of you are in

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.766
this kind of situation.
It's easy for us to be sitting

00:27:17.766 --> 00:27:21.827
here thinking clearly about it
and recognize the philosophical

00:27:21.827 --> 00:27:25.954
possibility of thinking clearly
about a case and realizing that

00:27:25.954 --> 00:27:28.750
it was a rational decision to
end it,

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:34.416
end your life.
But people who are actually in

00:27:34.416 --> 00:27:39.379
those situations in point of
fact are not able to think

00:27:39.379 --> 00:27:42.079
clearly.
Because just think about it.

00:27:42.079 --> 00:27:46.822
What would have to be true of
you for your life to be so bad

00:27:46.822 --> 00:27:51.966
that suicide might be a rational
choice, that you'd be better off

00:27:51.966 --> 00:27:54.625
dead?
Odds are you've got to be in

00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:58.359
some, indeed more than just
some, you've got to be in a

00:27:58.359 --> 00:28:02.286
great deal of pain.
Probably a great deal of

00:28:02.286 --> 00:28:04.792
physical pain.
Beyond that,

00:28:04.792 --> 00:28:09.806
you probably also need to be
incapacitated in a certain large

00:28:09.806 --> 00:28:13.463
number of ways,
so that perhaps you're

00:28:13.463 --> 00:28:18.650
bedridden, can't enjoy
discussions with your family,

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:21.650
can't read poetry,
or watch television,

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.897
or whatever it is.
A life watching television may

00:28:24.897 --> 00:28:28.288
not be as fantastic as the life
that you all are able to have,

00:28:28.288 --> 00:28:30.789
but it might still be better
than nothing.

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:35.646
To imagine a life so bad,
it's going to have to have so

00:28:35.646 --> 00:28:41.132
much physical disability that
the amount of emotional distress

00:28:41.132 --> 00:28:45.000
is going to have to be so
overwhelming,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.289
how could anybody think clearly
in a situation like that?

00:28:50.289 --> 00:28:54.746
And then, the argument might
go, if you can't think clearly,

00:28:54.746 --> 00:28:59.202
you can't rationally decide to
trust the judgment you

00:28:59.202 --> 00:29:03.357
might make that you're in a
situation where suicide is a

00:29:03.357 --> 00:29:08.326
reasonable choice.
You might make the judgment,

00:29:08.326 --> 00:29:14.640
but if we ask ourselves,
should you trust your opinion?

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.876
the odds are,
so the argument goes,

00:29:16.876 --> 00:29:20.427
no, you shouldn't trust your
opinion, precisely because

00:29:20.427 --> 00:29:24.307
anybody for whom it would be
true would have to be so

00:29:24.307 --> 00:29:27.727
emotionally distressed that
they're not able to think

00:29:27.727 --> 00:29:30.846
clearly.
If they're not able to think

00:29:30.846 --> 00:29:34.980
clearly, they can't have a
judgment that's trustworthy.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.986
If the judgment's not
trustworthy, you shouldn't trust

00:29:37.986 --> 00:29:40.321
it.
And so, suicide could never

00:29:40.321 --> 00:29:43.740
turn out to be a rational
opinion after all.

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:44.819
Well, that's an interesting
argument.

00:29:44.819 --> 00:29:48.324
It think it's an argument more
worth taking seriously than some

00:29:48.324 --> 00:29:50.924
of the other ones,
some of the early objections

00:29:50.924 --> 00:29:53.684
we've had against suicide.
But even here,

00:29:53.684 --> 00:29:57.503
I'm not convinced.
Let's again try to think of a

00:29:57.503 --> 00:30:01.349
case not quite like suicide and
ask ourselves,

00:30:01.349 --> 00:30:05.066
can't there be cases where
despite the fact that your

00:30:05.066 --> 00:30:08.640
thinking is clouded,
it's still reasonable to trust

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.000
the decisions that you make
within your clouded thinking?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.220
Suppose you've got some disease
that causes you a great deal of

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:21.420
incapacity and a great deal of
pain.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.873
But as it happens,
there's a cure,

00:30:23.873 --> 00:30:28.112
or at least there's a surgical
procedure that can be done,

00:30:28.112 --> 00:30:32.500
and the surgical procedure is
almost always successful.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:36.370
So, what are the choices?
Choice number one,

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:42.415
continue in your current state.
You've got some horrible,

00:30:42.415 --> 00:30:50.085
painful disease and it won't
get better unless you have the

00:30:50.085 --> 00:30:53.171
surgery.
If you do have the surgery,

00:30:53.171 --> 00:30:55.952
it's very, very likely that it
will get better,

00:30:55.952 --> 00:30:58.430
99 cases out of 100 the surgery
works,

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:02.754
or 99.9 cases out of 100 the
surgery works,

00:31:02.754 --> 00:31:07.490
or 99.99 cases out of 100 the
surgery works.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.900
Of course, like all surgery,
there are risks.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.132
Sometimes you put the person
under anesthesia and they don't

00:31:13.132 --> 00:31:15.055
wake up.
It doesn't happen very often,

00:31:15.055 --> 00:31:17.569
1 in 1,000,1 in 10,000,1 in
100,000, whatever it is.

00:31:17.569 --> 00:31:22.835
There's some chance the surgery
won't work and you'll die on the

00:31:22.835 --> 00:31:25.413
operating table.
But it's a very,

00:31:25.413 --> 00:31:28.299
very small chance,
overwhelmingly likely the

00:31:28.299 --> 00:31:32.011
surgery will succeed.
And if it does succeed,

00:31:32.011 --> 00:31:34.950
you'll be recovered.
That's option number one.

00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:39.246
Option number two,
you continue in your current

00:31:39.246 --> 00:31:44.104
state, incapacitated,
unable to lead a valuable life,

00:31:44.104 --> 00:31:48.648
suffering, full of pain.
Well, that's overwhelmingly

00:31:48.648 --> 00:31:51.185
likely.
1 in 1,000 cases there's some

00:31:51.185 --> 00:31:54.710
sort of natural cure,
maybe 1 in 10,000 cases there's

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.692
a natural cure.
But in 999 out of 1,000 cases

00:31:58.692 --> 00:32:03.932
or 9,999 out of 10,000 cases,
the disease just continues

00:32:03.932 --> 00:32:08.600
until, until you die some years
down the road.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.868
There's your choice.
Should you have the surgery or

00:32:11.868 --> 00:32:13.285
not?
Well, I suppose what we think

00:32:13.285 --> 00:32:15.140
is, of course you should
have the surgery.

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:17.150
You'd be a fool not to have the
surgery.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:21.010
It's overwhelmingly likely
going to cure you.

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.740
But now we worry.
Wait a minute.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.803
Can you trust that judgment?
After all, the condition you

00:32:26.803 --> 00:32:30.215
are in is so stressful,
so painful, that you are

00:32:30.215 --> 00:32:33.119
obviously very emotionally
worked up.

00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:37.026
And any judgment that you make
that it's a reasonable decision

00:32:37.026 --> 00:32:40.420
to have this surgery is a
judgment you're making while

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.109
under the cloud of emotional
distress.

00:32:43.109 --> 00:32:46.019
How could you possibly trust
that judgment?

00:32:46.019 --> 00:32:49.140
And so you shouldn't trust the
judgment, the argument goes.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:55.010
And so you must never agree to
the surgery in this situation.

00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:59.589
But that can't be right.
Surely we agree that it

00:32:59.589 --> 00:33:05.214
could be reasonable to
trust your judgment in this

00:33:05.214 --> 00:33:08.033
situation.
Now, to be sure,

00:33:08.033 --> 00:33:14.180
the fact that you are in all of
this pain should make you pause,

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:17.736
should make you hesitate,
should make you think twice,

00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:24.640
and then think again,
before deciding what to do.

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:28.537
But still, if somebody says,
since you're so worked up,

00:33:28.537 --> 00:33:32.433
it could never be
rational to decide to have the

00:33:32.433 --> 00:33:35.599
surgery,
that just seems to be going too

00:33:35.599 --> 00:33:38.460
far.
It doesn't make sense.

00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:40.720
You've got to make some kind of
decision.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:44.730
Deciding not to have the
surgery is still making a kind

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:48.003
of decision.
And either decision then is a

00:33:48.003 --> 00:33:52.238
judgment that you're going to be
making while worked up,

00:33:52.238 --> 00:33:55.626
while stressed,
while under the cloud of pain

00:33:55.626 --> 00:33:58.830
and suffering.
So think twice.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.387
Think a third time.
Get the opinions of others,

00:34:02.387 --> 00:34:05.196
perhaps.
But still, if somebody says it

00:34:05.196 --> 00:34:09.475
could never be rational
to decide to have the surgery

00:34:09.475 --> 00:34:13.320
and then act on that decision,
they're just wrong.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.840
Well, now let's come back to
the suicide case.

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.019
Same kinds of odds,
just reversed.

00:34:20.019 --> 00:34:24.649
If you don't decide to commit
suicide, we are imagining that

00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:29.199
it's overwhelmingly likely
you'll continue in suffering.

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:32.697
Some slight chance that you'll
recover, but overwhelmingly

00:34:32.697 --> 00:34:35.030
likely you'll continue in
suffering.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:39.048
Whereas, if you do kill
yourself, it's overwhelmingly

00:34:39.048 --> 00:34:43.221
likely and perhaps even
guaranteed, your suffering will

00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:46.857
come to an end.
The only chance that it won't

00:34:46.857 --> 00:34:50.820
is if you think there's some
chance of an afterlife.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.109
Well, should we be swayed by
the argument at this point that

00:34:55.109 --> 00:34:59.359
since you are suffering,
your judgment is cloudy and so

00:34:59.359 --> 00:35:02.190
you should not trust your
judgment?

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.590
Well, that can't be a good
argument.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.829
If it wasn't a good argument in
the surgery case,

00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:11.540
I can't see how it could
suddenly become a good argument

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.933
in the suicide case.
What does seem right is,

00:35:14.933 --> 00:35:19.441
precisely because you're
working and deciding under the

00:35:19.441 --> 00:35:22.250
cloud of emotional stress and
pain,

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:25.668
that you should think twice,
and think a third time,

00:35:25.668 --> 00:35:29.923
and perhaps think yet again.
You should not make this

00:35:29.923 --> 00:35:33.319
decision in haste.
You should discuss it with your

00:35:33.319 --> 00:35:36.450
doctors.
You should discuss it with your

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:39.871
loved ones.
But if somebody says you could

00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:44.416
never reasonably trust the
judgment that you make while in

00:35:44.416 --> 00:35:48.431
these circumstances,
I can only say that doesn't

00:35:48.431 --> 00:35:51.260
seem like a sound piece of
advice.

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:55.199
That claim doesn't seem right
to me.

00:35:55.199 --> 00:35:59.692
I conclude, therefore,
that as long as we're focused

00:35:59.692 --> 00:36:03.920
on the question of the
rationality of suicide,

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:07.801
ethics aside,
the rationality of suicide

00:36:07.801 --> 00:36:13.276
under certain circumstances,
suicide could be rationally

00:36:13.276 --> 00:36:17.487
justified.
You could have a life that is

00:36:17.487 --> 00:36:21.638
worse than nothing.
You could have good reason to

00:36:21.638 --> 00:36:24.380
believe you were in that
situation.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:28.924
You could either be thinking
clearly about your situation,

00:36:28.924 --> 00:36:33.070
or even if your judgment is
clouded and difficult,

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:37.634
you could still find the odds
sufficiently great that it was

00:36:37.634 --> 00:36:41.269
reasonable to eventually trust
your judgment.

00:36:41.269 --> 00:36:46.469
The rationality of suicide,
I think, is secured.

00:36:46.469 --> 00:36:50.004
But for all that of course,
it could still be

00:36:50.004 --> 00:36:54.262
immoral.
There could be actions that are

00:36:54.262 --> 00:36:57.900
rationally legitimate,
but for all that,

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:01.804
morally illegitimate.
As I mentioned previously,

00:37:01.804 --> 00:37:05.262
there's a big debate in
philosophy as to whether or not

00:37:05.262 --> 00:37:08.400
these two things can really come
apart or not.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:12.400
Arguably, reason actually
requires you to obey morality,

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:16.110
and so even if something's in
your self-interest,

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.930
perhaps it's not rational to do
it, if it's immoral.

00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:23.540
Interesting question.
Let's just bracket that

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:29.739
question and just focus directly
on the question now of morality.

00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:32.210
What should we say about the
morality of suicide?

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:36.370
Rationality aside,
what should we say about the

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:40.798
morality of suicide?
Well, to really do justice to

00:37:40.798 --> 00:37:44.247
this question,
of course, we would need to

00:37:44.247 --> 00:37:48.199
have an entire theory of
morality laid down,

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:51.750
and unsurprisingly,
I don't have time to do that

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:56.056
for us, an entire class on
introduction to ethics where we

00:37:56.056 --> 00:37:59.606
try to lay down a basic
fundamental theory about

00:37:59.606 --> 00:38:02.568
morality.
All we've got left is a couple

00:38:02.568 --> 00:38:05.250
of minutes today and then one
more lecture.

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:09.704
So instead, what I want to do
is first mention some quick and

00:38:09.704 --> 00:38:14.010
dirty arguments that have a kind
of moral tinge to them.

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:18.262
And then turn to some somewhat
more systematic arguments where

00:38:18.262 --> 00:38:22.374
I'll quickly put in place some
basic elements of a plausible

00:38:22.374 --> 00:38:25.295
moral theory.
We won't have time to explore

00:38:25.295 --> 00:38:27.989
them in detail,
but at least we'll get a shape

00:38:27.989 --> 00:38:32.000
of a basic moral theory and see
what it might say about suicide.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.414
So, systematic a little bit
later, first some quick and

00:38:37.414 --> 00:38:40.136
dirty arguments.
Whether we should call it a

00:38:40.136 --> 00:38:41.120
moral argument,
the first one,

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:44.789
or not, I'm not quite certain.
But it's certainly an argument

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:48.530
that gets stated all the time in
this area.

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:52.740
When we think about the
legitimacy of suicide,

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:57.418
it's common enough to have the
reaction, suicide is

00:38:57.418 --> 00:39:02.190
illegitimate because it's
thwarting God's will.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:05.400
Maybe this isn't so much a
moral argument as a theological

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.518
argument.
And for the most part,

00:39:07.518 --> 00:39:11.467
of course, as you know in this
class, I've avoided at least

00:39:11.467 --> 00:39:14.677
some theological questions.
Obviously, questions about the

00:39:14.677 --> 00:39:16.780
existence of a soul is itself a
theological argument.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:20.048
But I've tried to discuss them
as far as possible without

00:39:20.048 --> 00:39:23.900
bringing in questions about God,
God's existence and God's will.

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.366
But the topic's almost
unavoidable when we think about

00:39:27.366 --> 00:39:30.440
suicide, given the prevalence of
the thought,

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:34.950
it's God's will that we stay
alive and so it's going against

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.320
God's will to kill ourselves.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:47.284
Well, I think the best response
to this argument was given by

00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:50.500
David Hume some several
centuries ago,

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:54.309
two and a half centuries ago,
where Hume says,

00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:59.388
look, if all we've got to go on
is just the idea of a Creator

00:39:59.388 --> 00:40:02.690
who has built us and given us
life,

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:08.690
we can't infer that suicide is
against God's will.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:12.701
At least, if you've found that
thought a compelling one,

00:40:12.701 --> 00:40:17.004
then why wouldn't you also find
it compelling to say it goes

00:40:17.004 --> 00:40:21.380
against God's will when you
save somebody's life?

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.059
This is a point that's close to
one I've raised before.

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:27.344
You're walking along Chapel
Street and the person you're

00:40:27.344 --> 00:40:30.390
talking to, you see,
is about to be hit by a car.

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:34.589
So you push them out of the way.
Previously, when we talked

00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:36.803
about this question,
the question was whether or not

00:40:36.803 --> 00:40:40.045
they should be grateful to you.
Now the question is whether or

00:40:40.045 --> 00:40:42.930
not they should complain,
"How dare you do that!

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:49.126
You've thwarted God's will.
It was God's will that I be hit

00:40:49.126 --> 00:40:52.643
by that truck."
So, when we're about to save

00:40:52.643 --> 00:40:55.015
somebody's life,
should we decide not to do that

00:40:55.015 --> 00:40:58.145
on the grounds that it must be
God's will that they're going to

00:40:58.145 --> 00:41:00.523
die?
If you're a doctor and

00:41:00.523 --> 00:41:05.769
somebody's in cardiac arrest and
you could now perform CPR,

00:41:05.769 --> 00:41:07.999
or whatever it is,
in order to get their heart

00:41:07.999 --> 00:41:10.030
going again, should we say as a
doctor,

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:13.300
"Oh no, I must not do that.
It's God's will that they die.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:16.880
If I try to save their life,
I'm thwarting God's will."

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:25.690
Well, nobody says that.
But then, why is the argument

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:29.420
any better in the case of
suicide?

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.547
We could of course imagine,
when you've saved your friend's

00:41:33.547 --> 00:41:36.276
life and he says,
"Oh, you thwarted God's will,"

00:41:36.276 --> 00:41:38.570
what you might come back and say
is, "Oh, no, no.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:43.139
You see, it was God's will that
I save your life.

00:41:43.139 --> 00:41:46.061
And so it was God's will that
you be in the situation where

00:41:46.061 --> 00:41:48.679
the truck was going to hit you
unless I saved you.

00:41:48.679 --> 00:41:50.730
But it was also God's will that
I save your life."

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.740
And maybe the doctor should say
something similar.

00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:56.910
Not an implausible thing to say.
But given that that's not an

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.172
implausible thing to say,
why not say the same thing

00:42:00.172 --> 00:42:03.366
about suicide?
It was God's will that I be in

00:42:03.366 --> 00:42:06.597
this situation,
and then God's will that I kill

00:42:06.597 --> 00:42:10.553
myself.
Absent any special instruction

00:42:10.553 --> 00:42:15.325
manual from God,
the God's will argument cuts

00:42:15.325 --> 00:42:22.050
both ways, which is to say it
doesn't give us any guidance.

00:42:22.050 --> 00:42:26.094
We don't know whether it's
God's will that we act,

00:42:26.094 --> 00:42:30.469
or God's will that we don't
act, absent an instruction

00:42:30.469 --> 00:42:34.402
manual from God.
So, we can't conclude that

00:42:34.402 --> 00:42:39.670
suicide is obviously wrong,
because it violates God's will.

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.690
Well, unless you've got an
instruction manual.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.125
You might think,
for example,

00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:48.300
that the Bible tells us not to
commit suicide.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:52.867
And since the Bible is God's
word, we must do whatever the

00:42:52.867 --> 00:42:56.356
Bible tells us.
That's a kind of argument that

00:42:56.356 --> 00:42:58.980
I'm perfectly prepared to engage
in.

00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:01.908
Although, of course,
there's a lot of assumptions

00:43:01.908 --> 00:43:05.570
behind that argument that we
would need to really examine.

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:08.192
Is there a God?--Well,
obviously we needed that

00:43:08.192 --> 00:43:11.726
weighing in for the God's will
argument.--Has God expressed his

00:43:11.726 --> 00:43:16.480
will in a book?
If so, what book is it?

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.840
Do we have moral reason to obey
God?

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:21.130
Also relevant for the God's
will argument.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:23.965
And of course,
if we do think we have an

00:43:23.965 --> 00:43:27.019
obligation to obey this
instruction manual,

00:43:27.019 --> 00:43:31.309
are we really prepared to obey
this instruction manual?

00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:34.884
Even if there's a sentence in
this instruction manual that

00:43:34.884 --> 00:43:38.405
says don't commit suicide,
a lot of other things the

00:43:38.405 --> 00:43:42.644
instruction manual also says
that most of us are not inclined

00:43:42.644 --> 00:43:43.280
to do.

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:50.869
The instruction manual says not
to eat pork.

00:43:50.869 --> 00:43:54.059
Well, how many of you are not
willing to eat pork?

00:43:54.059 --> 00:43:58.441
The instruction manual tells
you not to mix various kinds of

00:43:58.441 --> 00:44:02.079
material together in a single
item of clothing.

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:04.320
How many of you think that
that's unacceptable?

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:08.097
The instruction manual tells
you that if a teenager is rude

00:44:08.097 --> 00:44:11.420
to their parents,
they should be stoned to death.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:14.219
How many of you think that
that's a moral requirement?

00:44:14.219 --> 00:44:17.147
If you're going to pick and
choose which bits of the

00:44:17.147 --> 00:44:20.650
instruction manual you actually
think are morally relevant,

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:24.052
then you can't come to me and
say, "Oh, suicide is wrong

00:44:24.052 --> 00:44:26.650
because the instruction manual
says so."

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:29.646
You're not really using the
instruction manual to give you

00:44:29.646 --> 00:44:32.313
moral guidance.
You're starting with your moral

00:44:32.313 --> 00:44:35.403
beliefs and then picking and
choosing which bits of the

00:44:35.403 --> 00:44:37.750
instruction manual you want to
accept.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.230
Well, that's a big question.
That's a big topic.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:44.615
And so having just touched on
it, I'm going to have to put it

00:44:44.615 --> 00:44:46.992
aside.
Instruction manual aside,

00:44:46.992 --> 00:44:49.214
at the very least,
we might say,

00:44:49.214 --> 00:44:53.372
appeal to God's will can't help
us to decide whether or not

00:44:53.372 --> 00:44:57.603
suicide is legitimate or not.
But there's a different quick

00:44:57.603 --> 00:45:00.400
and dirty argument.
Also it can be run in a

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:03.385
theological form,
but it need not be run that

00:45:03.385 --> 00:45:05.916
way.
And that has to do with

00:45:05.916 --> 00:45:10.134
gratitude.
We've been given life and

00:45:10.134 --> 00:45:16.854
life's pretty amazing.
And so we have an obligation,

00:45:16.854 --> 00:45:21.760
a debt of gratitude to keep the
gift.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.881
Now look, gratitude is not one
of the moral virtues that gets a

00:45:25.881 --> 00:45:29.078
lot of discussion nowadays.
It's fallen on rather hard

00:45:29.078 --> 00:45:32.552
times.
But I see no reason to dismiss

00:45:32.552 --> 00:45:34.855
it.
It does seem to me there is

00:45:34.855 --> 00:45:37.440
such a thing as a debt of
gratitude.

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:43.300
If someone does you a favor,
you owe them something.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:44.570
You owe them a debt of
gratitude.

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:49.190
And so the argument might then
go, look, either God gave us

00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:53.969
life, or nature gave us life,
or our parents gave us life.

00:45:53.969 --> 00:45:58.211
Whatever it was,
we owe a debt of gratitude for

00:45:58.211 --> 00:46:01.486
this wonderful gift.
And as such,

00:46:01.486 --> 00:46:07.093
how do you repay the debt?
You repay the debt by

00:46:07.093 --> 00:46:12.923
keeping the gift.
If you kill yourself,

00:46:12.923 --> 00:46:18.073
you're rejecting the gift.
That's being ungrateful,

00:46:18.073 --> 00:46:21.050
and ingratitude is immoral.
It's wrong.

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:25.477
And that's why suicide is wrong.
That's the second quick and

00:46:25.477 --> 00:46:26.620
dirty argument.

00:46:29.929 --> 00:46:33.570
Perhaps it won't surprise you
that I don't find this second

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:37.586
argument persuasive either.
Not because I'm skeptical about

00:46:37.586 --> 00:46:41.058
debts of gratitude,
but I want us to pay attention

00:46:41.058 --> 00:46:45.380
to what exactly obligations of
gratitude require us to do.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.223
In particular,
it's important to bear in mind

00:46:48.223 --> 00:46:51.971
that you owe the person who
gives you a gift something only

00:46:51.971 --> 00:46:54.752
when what he's giving you,
or she's giving you,

00:46:54.752 --> 00:46:55.510
is a gift.

00:46:59.059 --> 00:47:04.674
Imagine that somebody,
I'll call him The Bully,

00:47:04.674 --> 00:47:09.190
gives you a pie and says,
"Eat it."

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.989
But it's not an apple pie.
It's not a cherry pie.

00:47:11.989 --> 00:47:16.336
It's some gross,
disgusting, slime pie,

00:47:16.336 --> 00:47:22.513
some rotting slime pie,
and he cuts out a big piece and

00:47:22.513 --> 00:47:26.639
he says, "Eat it."
Do you owe this person,

00:47:26.639 --> 00:47:29.440
as a debt of gratitude,
out of gratitude,

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.360
do you owe him the obligation
to eat the pie and continue

00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:36.795
eating the pie?
That would seem like a rather

00:47:36.795 --> 00:47:40.118
odd thing to claim.
This guy is indeed,

00:47:40.118 --> 00:47:43.449
as I've named him,
just a bully.

00:47:43.449 --> 00:47:46.111
Now, of course,
typical bullies,

00:47:46.111 --> 00:47:50.575
at least in the comic book
cases, bullies are big and

00:47:50.575 --> 00:47:52.942
strong.
The bully might be able to say

00:47:52.942 --> 00:47:58.981
the following thing to you.
"You eat this pie or I will

00:47:58.981 --> 00:48:03.809
beat you up.
I'll beat the crap out of you."

00:48:03.809 --> 00:48:06.309
And look, I'm not a very strong
guy.

00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:10.086
He might well be able to do it,
and I might not,

00:48:10.086 --> 00:48:13.380
I might well know he is going
to do it.

00:48:13.380 --> 00:48:16.955
And so, it might be
prudent for me to eat the

00:48:16.955 --> 00:48:20.320
slime pie, disgusting,
appalling as it may be.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.018
It might be better to have a
couple of slices of slime pie

00:48:24.018 --> 00:48:28.698
than to be beaten up to a pulp.
But there's no moral obligation

00:48:28.698 --> 00:48:32.501
here.
There's no moral requirement to

00:48:32.501 --> 00:48:36.993
eat the pie.
Well, if God takes on the role

00:48:36.993 --> 00:48:41.855
of bully and says,
"Eat the pie or I'll send you

00:48:41.855 --> 00:48:47.545
to hell," maybe it would be
prudent of you to do what he

00:48:47.545 --> 00:48:50.800
says.
And if God takes on the role of

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.736
bully and says,
"Even though your life has

00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:57.460
become so horrible that you'd be
better off dead,

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:01.543
I insist that you keep living
or I'll send you to hell if you

00:49:01.543 --> 00:49:05.118
kill yourself,"
maybe it's prudent of you not

00:49:05.118 --> 00:49:08.335
to kill yourself.
But there's no moral

00:49:08.335 --> 00:49:13.283
requirement here.
God's just a bully on this

00:49:13.283 --> 00:49:16.559
story.
Now, that's not to say that I

00:49:16.559 --> 00:49:19.919
think God is a bully.
If you believe,

00:49:19.919 --> 00:49:22.954
plausibly enough,
God is good,

00:49:22.954 --> 00:49:29.023
then God's not going to want
you to continue eating the pie

00:49:29.023 --> 00:49:33.020
once it's spoiled.
He gives you an apple pie.

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.100
He says, "Eat it.
It's good for you.

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.750
You'll like it."
Out of gratitude, you eat it.

00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:40.704
But then God,
not being a bully,

00:49:40.704 --> 00:49:45.849
says, "If the pie ever spoils,
you can stop eating."

00:49:45.849 --> 00:49:50.729
Why in the world would he
insist that we continue to eat a

00:49:50.729 --> 00:49:55.613
spoiled pie if He's not a bully?
So, I can't see how any

00:49:55.613 --> 00:50:00.420
argument from gratitude is going
to get off the ground.

00:50:00.420 --> 00:50:02.774
If there's something immoral
about suicide,

00:50:02.774 --> 00:50:05.914
we're not going to get the
immorality through these quick

00:50:05.914 --> 00:50:09.106
and dirty arguments.
We're going to have to get it

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:12.289
from some more systematic appeal
to moral theory.

00:50:12.289 --> 00:50:15.000
And that's what we'll turn to
next time.

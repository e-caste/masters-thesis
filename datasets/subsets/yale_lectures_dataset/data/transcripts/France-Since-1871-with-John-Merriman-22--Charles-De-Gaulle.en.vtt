00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.410
Professor John Merriman:
This is all relevant.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.082
What happened at
Villiers-le-Bel was that you got

00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:09.760
your basic cop car,
coming along,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.429
and it wasn't rolling
aggressively,

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.903
it was about fifty kilometers
an hour, and these two young

00:00:16.903 --> 00:00:21.829
North-African extraction youths,
without helmets,

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:26.433
didn't yield to the car.
They were on a scooter,

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:29.424
sort of essentially a
motorcycle, not a big one but a

00:00:29.424 --> 00:00:31.870
scooter.
And, so, they hit the car on

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.640
the left side and unfortunately
they were both killed.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.874
And then the police stayed a
bit and made calls but the calls

00:00:39.874 --> 00:00:43.519
that they made were more,
"we have something spinning out

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.098
of control," it's not about how
are these two kids who--and you

00:00:46.098 --> 00:00:47.640
see,
they left it there for two

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.271
days, they circled it all away.
So, you still see these little

00:00:51.271 --> 00:00:55.315
guys' tennis shoes and you
see--you can see traces of their

00:00:55.315 --> 00:00:58.242
having expired.
And, so, Villiers-le-Bel,

00:00:58.242 --> 00:01:01.856
which is about eighteen
kilometers north of Paris--it's

00:01:01.856 --> 00:01:03.825
near Roissy,
it's near Sarcelles,

00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:05.706
where there was a lot of
trouble before,

00:01:05.706 --> 00:01:08.560
it's near Gonesse;
it's in the Val d'Oise--went up

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.292
in flames basically,
and unfortunately a lot of

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:13.430
people were hurt in the
fighting.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.951
And yesterday they burned,
somebody stupidly burned the

00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:18.286
library, and the library is not
associated with the

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.780
flics,
with the cops,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.730
it's not associated with the
State even, it is the municipal

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.480
library where lots of kids go
and study in the municipal

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.455
library.
And, so, this was just la

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:29.300
connerie,
this is not possible to do

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.842
stuff like that.
But, anyway,

00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:34.000
part of the problem is that
Sarkozy denigrated the people in

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.742
the suburbs as racaille,
as scum, by implication,

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:41.908
that--and was Minister of the
Interior during the big

00:01:41.908 --> 00:01:44.400
troubles,
a couple of years ago;

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.084
which I'm going to talk about
on Wednesday,

00:01:46.084 --> 00:01:47.247
the troubles,
which started in

00:01:47.247 --> 00:01:49.037
Clichy-sous-Bois.
But there's a lot of--in

00:01:49.037 --> 00:01:51.129
Toulouse where there had been
trouble two years ago,

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:53.620
now it's happening in Toulouse,
too, but I didn't--I'll watch

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.273
it this afternoon.
It's a problem,

00:01:56.273 --> 00:02:01.500
it's going to be a big problem
for awhile.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.984
And what makes it a little more
scary is that this wasn't an

00:02:03.984 --> 00:02:06.385
incident, where there have been
incidents where the police

00:02:06.385 --> 00:02:08.870
are--the police systematically
control people of color,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.520
systematically,
in France, systematically.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.381
I go through
Barbès-Rochechouart,

00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:19.196
which is a metro stop famous
for the first place that

00:02:19.196 --> 00:02:23.085
somebody shot and killed a
German officer during Vichy

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:26.937
and--or the Gare de Lyon.
I was in the Gare de Lyon,

00:02:26.937 --> 00:02:30.335
not the other day but at the
end of November--or for that

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:32.520
matter after Sarkozy was
elected;

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.403
you go to the Gare de Lyon
metro stop and all of a sudden

00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:40.495
you turn the corner and then
you've got ten policemen there,

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:43.573
controlling people.
I've lived--I've spent half my

00:02:43.573 --> 00:02:45.650
life in France for the last
thirty years.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.240
I have never been controlled,
not once, not once.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.195
And I've been with people going
through, and you turn the

00:02:51.195 --> 00:02:53.360
corner, and all of a sudden
you've got all the police there.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.281
And who do they pick out?
They don't pick out whites

00:02:57.281 --> 00:03:01.543
carrying little academic
briefcases, they pick out

00:03:01.543 --> 00:03:05.893
everybody, practically,
who is young and who is not

00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:08.677
white.
And so this rubs people the

00:03:08.677 --> 00:03:12.535
wrong way, to say the least,
and it's part of the way this

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:15.390
works in the suburbs.
And, so, this incident,

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.438
which involved a police car,
was not coming in and sort of

00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:21.220
saying "up against the mall MF"
and all this but,

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.640
"let's see your papers."
Because that's what happens,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.148
and I've seen that happen.
It was just unfortunately these

00:03:26.148 --> 00:03:28.389
two policemen--who weren't doing
anything wrong,

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.271
they were just--it was a banal
trip through a banal suburb--

00:03:32.271 --> 00:03:36.350
happened to hit these two kids
who were not wearing helmets and

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.535
so they were killed.
But this is--who knows what's

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:42.753
going to happen in this.
But this is part of when you

00:03:42.753 --> 00:03:46.027
see La Haine,
hate, you see--that's the best

00:03:46.027 --> 00:03:49.039
translation simply of it is
hatred or hate.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:52.497
And to understand how people in
the suburbs feel you have to

00:03:52.497 --> 00:03:55.837
understand the relationship
between both--and I'm going to

00:03:55.837 --> 00:03:57.830
do this again,
in more detail;

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.229
I better get to what I'm doing
today.

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:05.053
But that it's not just young
people with not much of a

00:04:05.053 --> 00:04:09.449
future, it also is,
mostly has to do with

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:14.723
under-privileged and
under-appreciated minorities

00:04:14.723 --> 00:04:19.405
pitted against the CRS,
the national kind of military

00:04:19.405 --> 00:04:21.519
police, as well as the municipal
police.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.835
And of course what the
government of Chirac did was

00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:27.886
take away all the money
virtually for voluntary

00:04:27.886 --> 00:04:31.931
associations that are bridges to
helping integrate people into

00:04:31.931 --> 00:04:35.976
the communities in which they
live and into the State in which

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:38.173
they live.
But ce n'est pas

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:39.758
évident,
comme on dit en

00:04:39.758 --> 00:04:41.554
français,
it's just--oh,

00:04:41.554 --> 00:04:45.300
well, there we go.
How did we get on that?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.900
We got on that because it's
important to talk about.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.982
Allez.
So, today I'm going to talk

00:04:49.982 --> 00:04:53.457
about Charles de Gaulle.
In November 1970,

00:04:53.457 --> 00:04:58.013
ça passe vite,
les temps,

00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:03.251
I was a student in Paris,
just a little older than you,

00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:06.042
and living in an
eleven-franc-a-night hotel,

00:05:06.042 --> 00:05:10.259
on rue Monsieur le Prince--that
was about two dollars a night.

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.294
My hotel room wasn't worth
that, actually,

00:05:13.294 --> 00:05:16.699
but it was kind of an
interesting place to live

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.480
for--again,
I was living in Limoges for a

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.811
lot of the year too.
I went to the Archives one day

00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:25.711
about--get there early,
which I always do,

00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:29.813
and this little man who was a
World War Two veteran who had

00:05:29.813 --> 00:05:33.644
lost most of his arm in the war,
who would check my ID,

00:05:33.644 --> 00:05:37.066
but he knew me so there was no
problem--my wife used to come in

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:39.234
looking for me,
when she was my wife,

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:42.199
carrying our baby and the
groceries, and it's all very

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.270
décont
racté,

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.100
very informal;
it's not that way any more.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.817
And he said,
"we're going to close because

00:05:48.817 --> 00:05:52.529
the general, il est
mort"--the general is dead.

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.350
And Charles de Gaulle died,
had died.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.585
And I, I think,
infuriated my Gaullist friend

00:05:57.585 --> 00:06:00.379
by saying that he died of
boredom watching French TV;

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:03.695
but he was off in
Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises,

00:06:03.695 --> 00:06:07.860
and he had died at age--he
must've just been eighty;

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.029
wasn't he eighty when he died,
do you remember?

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:11.970
You don't remember,
but anyway I think he was

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:15.497
eighty when he died.
And, so, later my Gaullist

00:06:15.497 --> 00:06:19.530
friend, who's a lawyer,
a Parisian lawyer,

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:23.586
called me up and said,
"look, why don't we go down to

00:06:23.586 --> 00:06:26.993
Notre Dame and go to the Mass?"
De Gaulle didn't want to have a

00:06:26.993 --> 00:06:30.291
Mass, and I didn't particularly
want to go down to Notre Dame

00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.709
and go to the Mass for Charles
de Gaulle,

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:36.448
but he said that it'll be--it's
a historical event,

00:06:36.448 --> 00:06:39.440
we should be there,
you should see it.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.947
And so I went down,
we went down at three in the

00:06:41.947 --> 00:06:44.882
morning and waited in line,
and then they'd flown in all

00:06:44.882 --> 00:06:47.095
these people.
Haile Selassie was there,

00:06:47.095 --> 00:06:49.497
that was kind of amazing to see
Haile Selassie,

00:06:49.497 --> 00:06:52.840
and the odious Richard Nixon
was there and all these leaders,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.657
with rather minimum security.
This was not in a high security

00:06:55.657 --> 00:06:57.267
time.
You could see people who were

00:06:57.267 --> 00:07:00.079
carrying machineguns up on the
towers, you could see people in

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:02.800
the cathedral up--I was about
the only person anyone saw get

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.329
frisked,
going in.

00:07:04.329 --> 00:07:06.769
They looked at me and said we
want to check you out;

00:07:06.769 --> 00:07:08.922
so they checked me out,
with the long hair and all

00:07:08.922 --> 00:07:10.786
that.
But we got in there,

00:07:10.786 --> 00:07:14.367
and it was a moment of--as a
moment of history,

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:18.929
and it was something to see.
His influence on French life

00:07:18.929 --> 00:07:23.152
and the memory of French life
can hardly--the collective

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:26.579
memory,
of collective memory in French

00:07:26.579 --> 00:07:29.769
life, can hardly be
underestimated;

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:35.087
yet it was so long ago that he
died, and the party that bore

00:07:35.087 --> 00:07:38.849
his name disappeared,
that even if someone like

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:41.418
Sarkozy or, before him,
Jacques Chirac,

00:07:41.418 --> 00:07:44.190
would go to
Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises,

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.115
this village in the
Haute-Marne, in the east of

00:07:47.115 --> 00:07:50.930
France, to have their picture
taken in front of his tomb with

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.000
the Croix de Lorraine--de Gaulle
seems like a long time ago.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.391
But what he did in 1958 is of
course to rescue the French

00:08:02.391 --> 00:08:07.802
State and to define,
in his own personage,

00:08:07.802 --> 00:08:14.269
a certain idea of France that
he represented.

00:08:14.269 --> 00:08:18.418
And to borrow a Catholic image,
de Gaulle who was born in

00:08:18.418 --> 00:08:21.120
Lille, right near,
as I said the other day,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.120
right near the fortress--Lille
is a pretty Catholic town--he

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.459
was not himself a practicing
religious man,

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:29.815
but I suppose it's a religious
image that I somehow have

00:08:29.815 --> 00:08:33.354
retained in the back of my mind
from the days at a good old

00:08:33.354 --> 00:08:38.547
Jesuit high school in Portland,
Oregon, that he saw himself as

00:08:38.547 --> 00:08:43.950
the mystical body of France,
that somehow the whole,

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:46.138
that is his body,
his personage,

00:08:46.138 --> 00:08:49.032
his very being,
was bigger than all of the

00:08:49.032 --> 00:08:52.279
parts that constituted the body
of France,

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:58.425
and that he represented France
with his very existence,

00:08:58.425 --> 00:09:04.230
and that this was how he wanted
to be remembered.

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:09.984
And when he leaves power in
1969, after a rather obscure

00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:15.529
election, plebiscite really,
that that image still was

00:09:15.529 --> 00:09:20.042
retained.
There are really three elements

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:26.041
that represented his image and
the myth of Charles de Gaulle

00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:31.495
after World War Two.
That he was the providential

00:09:31.495 --> 00:09:37.725
figure who through his own
determination had saved France

00:09:37.725 --> 00:09:43.509
and its honor after the blowout
of May/June 1940;

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:48.694
that as his voice crackled over
the BBC on the 18th of June,

00:09:48.694 --> 00:09:53.352
1940, a date that's still
commemorated every year when

00:09:53.352 --> 00:09:58.888
there's a Gaullist in power and
a mayor of France such as Chirac

00:09:58.888 --> 00:10:03.809
there's always a little event to
commemorate that;

00:10:03.809 --> 00:10:07.379
that he had restored the
integrity of France.

00:10:07.379 --> 00:10:10.200
My friend Bob Paxton,
as I reminded you the other

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.549
day, argued that Pétain
might have saved the French

00:10:13.549 --> 00:10:16.370
State but he did not save the
French nation;

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.850
he destroyed it by destroying
liberty, fraternity,

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:23.270
equality, and what that means.
That Charles de Gaulle had

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:28.547
restored the integrity of
France, had restored the

00:10:28.547 --> 00:10:35.009
sovereignty of French over their
own political existence,

00:10:35.009 --> 00:10:38.043
which is obvious,
and the republic itself,

00:10:38.043 --> 00:10:42.409
by being involved in the
creation of the Fourth Republic,

00:10:42.409 --> 00:10:45.400
but then repudiating the way it
was established,

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.090
wanting centralized executive
authority and all of that,

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:53.669
and then would go off pouting
to Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises.

00:10:53.669 --> 00:11:02.201
That he'd then he'd reunified
the nation after the civil war

00:11:02.201 --> 00:11:06.164
that was Vichy.
But, again, with a Gaullist

00:11:06.164 --> 00:11:08.728
twist is that everybody had
basically resisted,

00:11:08.728 --> 00:11:11.335
or wanted to resist,
that they were always ready

00:11:11.335 --> 00:11:14.282
with the gun nearby to go and
kill the German when they could

00:11:14.282 --> 00:11:18.721
and to restore France,
and that hardly anyone had

00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:21.711
collaborated.
So, this was sort of the

00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:25.086
Gaullist take on this.
And that he had restored the

00:11:25.086 --> 00:11:28.336
centralized state--not after
World War Two,

00:11:28.336 --> 00:11:32.746
because the Fourth Republic was
this sort of swinging door

00:11:32.746 --> 00:11:35.269
ministry;
it's rather like the Third

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:38.590
Republic--which as in the case
of the Third Republic gave the

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.911
illusion that French political
life was more unstable than it

00:11:41.911 --> 00:11:43.661
was,
because the deputies of the

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:45.793
Fourth Republic,
like the deputies of the Third

00:11:45.793 --> 00:11:48.132
Republic,
it was a club where the same

00:11:48.132 --> 00:11:51.634
people were re-elected time and
time again from the same

00:11:51.634 --> 00:11:55.788
constituencies.
But de Gaulle's thing was that

00:11:55.788 --> 00:12:02.004
the only form of government that
could restore the integrity of

00:12:02.004 --> 00:12:07.720
France and end the factions of
parliamentary quarrels,

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:10.707
and quarreling,
and he hated the communists,

00:12:10.707 --> 00:12:14.250
of course, was a strongly
centralized government.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:17.017
And for that he had to wait,
as you now know,

00:12:17.017 --> 00:12:19.659
until cinquante-huit,
until 1958,

00:12:19.659 --> 00:12:25.649
with a constitution written for
him by Michel Debré,

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:29.159
who personified Gaullism
itself,

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:33.679
and whose son is an important
figure in contemporary France.

00:12:33.679 --> 00:12:38.922
This is very important for de
Gaulle's view of France,

00:12:38.922 --> 00:12:42.956
is that he had freed France,
in his mind,

00:12:42.956 --> 00:12:48.110
from the anarchy of political
parties that were quarreling,

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:53.620
a parliamentary government that
he didn't think had worked,

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:57.900
that was incapable of restoring
the "grandeur" of France--a word

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.715
to which he returned constantly;
more about that in

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:06.902
awhile--strengthening the French
state under a new constitution

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:10.918
that--written by
Debré--that gave France a

00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:15.435
strong executive with a
president who would be in power

00:13:15.435 --> 00:13:19.779
for seven years,
and who had strong executive

00:13:19.779 --> 00:13:22.756
authority.
Now, those of you who know

00:13:22.756 --> 00:13:27.434
anything about France before
1871, if this doesn't sound like

00:13:27.434 --> 00:13:31.637
Napoleon,
both N-I, Napoleon the First,

00:13:31.637 --> 00:13:37.721
and N-III, Napoleon the
Third--it's an obvious thing to

00:13:37.721 --> 00:13:40.078
say,
but it's still true--that

00:13:40.078 --> 00:13:43.591
in--there's no need you should
know this, but some of you

00:13:43.591 --> 00:13:45.850
do--1799 on the 18th of
Brumaire,

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.853
Napoleon, with the help of the
wily Abbe Sieyes,

00:13:49.853 --> 00:13:53.857
the priest, Sieyes,
who wrote "What is the Third

00:13:53.857 --> 00:13:57.440
Estate,"
overthrow the Assembly.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.964
Napoleon had a bit of a
faltering and his brother Lucien

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:02.810
helped him out there,
because he lost--the only time

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:06.213
in his life he really lost his
courage--they overthrow the

00:14:06.213 --> 00:14:09.198
government and impose a
consulate in which Napoleon

00:14:09.198 --> 00:14:12.899
becomes the first council and
finally snatches the crown,

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:15.654
it is thought,
from the Pope and crowns

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:19.823
himself emperor.
And Napoleon adopts what would

00:14:19.823 --> 00:14:23.928
become the most Gaullist
political strategy,

00:14:23.928 --> 00:14:28.509
shared by that of governments
of North Korea,

00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:32.830
among other dictatorships,
that is the plebiscite,

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:36.710
where you ask people with a
cagy question,

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.622
"Do you agree"-- for example,
Napoleon III,

00:14:39.622 --> 00:14:43.436
just before the fall of the
whole mess at the end of the

00:14:43.436 --> 00:14:45.723
1860s,
in 1870 there was a plebiscite,

00:14:45.723 --> 00:14:48.910
"Do you agree with the reforms
that have been undertaken by our

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.470
glorious Emperor?"
et cetera, et cetera.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.246
If you write "no," you're
saying, "well,

00:14:53.246 --> 00:14:55.798
I don't really like reforms,"
and so therefore do you say

00:14:55.798 --> 00:14:58.304
"yes" because you like reforms
or "yes" because you like

00:14:58.304 --> 00:15:00.321
Napoleon III?
And, so, naturally the

00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:02.886
plebiscite is like a North
Korean plebiscite where

00:15:02.886 --> 00:15:05.765
ninety-nine percent of the
people say oui--that's

00:15:05.765 --> 00:15:09.220
what Napoleon III did after he
overthrew the Second Republic.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.085
So, there are strong
continuities between Napoleon

00:15:14.085 --> 00:15:19.744
and the idea of a centralized
state overcoming the sort of

00:15:19.744 --> 00:15:24.803
quarreling factions of France.
And Napoleon I put an end to

00:15:24.803 --> 00:15:27.207
what was called,
rather colorfully and an

00:15:27.207 --> 00:15:30.422
unfortunate phrase,
but "the war of the chamber

00:15:30.422 --> 00:15:34.137
pots" that was the French
Directory, before this whole

00:15:34.137 --> 00:15:37.560
thing is overthrown.
And, so, there's an appeal to

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.410
the nation.
And Napoleon was one of the

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.299
originators of an aggressive
kind of nationalism.

00:15:44.299 --> 00:15:47.320
But Napoleon was perceived as
somebody on the Left.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.954
Napoleon III,
before he was Napoleon III,

00:15:49.954 --> 00:15:53.246
in 1841, wrote a little
pamphlet called "Property,"

00:15:53.246 --> 00:15:55.880
about property,
called "The Extinction of

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.141
Pauperism";
and the idea that somehow the

00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:03.350
caring State cares about all
people in France and that all

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:07.780
people in France find part of
their identity in the notion of

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.649
being French.
And as you already know from

00:16:10.649 --> 00:16:13.617
things we've talked about,
that part of nationalism was

00:16:13.617 --> 00:16:16.861
this sort of aggressive carrying
of the French language into

00:16:16.861 --> 00:16:19.059
corners in which it was not
spoken,

00:16:19.059 --> 00:16:24.240
or spoken only as a second way
of speaking, language,

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.130
dialect, patois,
et cetera,

00:16:27.130 --> 00:16:32.569
et cetera.
So, the idea of a national will

00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:41.056
represented in the body of a
strong executive authority is a

00:16:41.056 --> 00:16:50.263
Napoleonic idea that became part
of the political existence of de

00:16:50.263 --> 00:16:55.740
Gaulle,
and ultimately of Gaullism.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.536
But you had to have the idea of
it being ratified by the

00:16:59.536 --> 00:17:02.786
people--thus plebiscites.
Now, Pétain,

00:17:02.786 --> 00:17:06.653
the difference is that
Pétain in World War Two,

00:17:06.653 --> 00:17:10.386
the "national revolution,"
in quotes, with the

00:17:10.386 --> 00:17:14.554
Marshall--again the military
connection, Napoleon,

00:17:14.554 --> 00:17:16.954
Pétain,
as he saw it,

00:17:16.954 --> 00:17:21.211
and de Gaulle--it was never
ratified by any kind of popular

00:17:21.211 --> 00:17:25.762
vote because it was an even more
authoritarian government under

00:17:25.762 --> 00:17:28.053
Vichy.
The 1920s and the '30s,

00:17:28.053 --> 00:17:31.085
and the first half of the
1940s, was the wave of

00:17:31.085 --> 00:17:34.826
authoritarianism that cost the
lives of so many millions of

00:17:34.826 --> 00:17:38.359
people,
I need not remind you.

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:41.648
And that Bonapartism,
as in Gaullism,

00:17:41.648 --> 00:17:46.855
involved the kind of stamp of
popular approval seen in the

00:17:46.855 --> 00:17:51.880
plebiscites of 1958,
and in subsequent plebiscites.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:57.862
And he goes out in 1969,
after he loses--they lose the

00:17:57.862 --> 00:18:00.774
plebiscite.
On January 18th--no,

00:18:00.774 --> 00:18:04.963
I must've written this wrong,
it must be the dix-huit de

00:18:04.963 --> 00:18:07.590
juin,
it must be June 18th,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:12.200
1940--he says "I"--he often
said "we," the royal "we,"

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.144
but in this case he said "I,"
because he wasn't yet running

00:18:15.144 --> 00:18:16.869
the show--"I,
General de Gaulle,

00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:20.758
French soldier and leader,
am conscious that I am speaking

00:18:20.758 --> 00:18:24.170
in the name of France"--that I
represent France;

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.657
again the mystical body.
Michel Debré--again

00:18:28.657 --> 00:18:31.889
d-e-b-r-e--who wrote this
constitution of '58,

00:18:31.889 --> 00:18:35.480
said that the only chance for
French democracy,

00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:40.643
if that term may be used,
is to have a republican

00:18:40.643 --> 00:18:46.559
monarch, and that was the
Gaullist view of de Gaulle.

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:53.748
And he resigns on the 20th of
June, 1946, and the Fourth

00:18:53.748 --> 00:18:59.500
Republic comes into existence
without him.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:04.248
Now, when he returns to power,
in '58, it was after--because

00:19:04.248 --> 00:19:08.191
of the chaos of what was
happening in Algeria that

00:19:08.191 --> 00:19:13.019
republican institutions seemed
to have been discredited.

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:19.763
And, so, he has the upper hand
there to identify himself with

00:19:19.763 --> 00:19:24.259
the strongly centralized French
state.

00:19:24.259 --> 00:19:28.437
It was clear in 1958,
as it had been clear with

00:19:28.437 --> 00:19:33.250
Napoleon--but this is a
different case--Napoleon I,

00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:39.648
that it was only de Gaulle at
that moment who could impose

00:19:39.648 --> 00:19:45.740
discipline on the French Army;
thus the howls of betrayal when

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:50.094
the other generals say he's
going to let Algeria become

00:19:50.094 --> 00:19:54.421
free.
And thus the sense of betrayal,

00:19:54.421 --> 00:19:59.608
and they try to kill him.
And, so, but for all of his

00:19:59.608 --> 00:20:03.494
verbal-- his respect for and
endorsement of popular

00:20:03.494 --> 00:20:07.745
sovereignty,
but his tool of State is really

00:20:07.745 --> 00:20:12.822
often the plebiscite,
which you can argue is sort of

00:20:12.822 --> 00:20:18.233
a sham tool of democracy.
What he does--and reflecting

00:20:18.233 --> 00:20:23.760
the fact that the 1880s and the
1890s are the period of mass

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:29.099
politics when the first
political parties are created.

00:20:29.099 --> 00:20:32.880
Napoleon I and Napoleon III did
not create political parties.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.859
Political parties did not exist
in France;

00:20:34.859 --> 00:20:37.273
they existed,
the Whigs and the Tories

00:20:37.273 --> 00:20:40.470
existed in England already,
but that is a long,

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:45.221
complicated story that starts
with the run up to the English

00:20:45.221 --> 00:20:49.490
Civil War at the middle of the
seventeenth century.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:53.392
But he creates a political
party that will support him,

00:20:53.392 --> 00:20:55.559
and his support,
the people,

00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:59.198
a lot of the people who were
Gaullists in the late 1940s were

00:20:59.198 --> 00:21:02.174
part of what is called the MRP,
or whatever,

00:21:02.174 --> 00:21:06.720
the big mass Catholic political
party which was extremely

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:14.013
conservative.
But he--the essence of this was

00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:22.720
strongly centralized authority.
Did he consciously pattern

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.050
himself after the Napoleons,
or after Boulanger for that

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:31.036
matter?
He'd been born in 1890,

00:21:31.036 --> 00:21:36.210
in Lille, but brought up in--I
think he was born in Lille,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:38.493
I'm sure I've seen this house
in which I thought he was born,

00:21:38.493 --> 00:21:40.130
in Lille, but he was brought up
in Paris.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:46.109
He loved the Arc de Triomphe
and he loved Invalides,

00:21:46.109 --> 00:21:50.329
which is where Napoleon is
buried.

00:21:50.329 --> 00:21:54.230
I've got to just give you one
small story, which I don't think

00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:56.729
I've related.
There is a famous American

00:21:56.729 --> 00:22:00.341
tennis player who the first time
this tennis player was in the

00:22:00.341 --> 00:22:03.014
French Open,
which is sponsored the Banque

00:22:03.014 --> 00:22:06.090
Nationale de Paris,
they took this tennis player on

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:08.776
a tour of Paris,
and that tour got kind of old

00:22:08.776 --> 00:22:12.065
for this particular player;
after about an hour and a half

00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:15.043
this person had seen enough.
And then finally they said,

00:22:15.043 --> 00:22:17.291
some journalists said,
"what do you like best about

00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:19.578
what you saw in Paris?"
and the tennis player said,

00:22:19.578 --> 00:22:21.940
"Oh, I really liked the tomb
with the little dead dude;"

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.217
and the little dead dude is of
course Napoleon,

00:22:25.217 --> 00:22:28.779
and that image is stillâ€¦
Napoleon's tomb,

00:22:28.779 --> 00:22:31.694
which you see from above,
you can't see in the tomb,

00:22:31.694 --> 00:22:34.779
it's not like when you're
looking at Lenin or something

00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:37.900
but--is a massive tourist draw,
and that is something that's

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.619
always happened,
that's always been the case

00:22:39.619 --> 00:22:42.152
since then.
He was a lecturer at the

00:22:42.152 --> 00:22:47.082
Military College of Saint-Cyr,
near Paris, and he lectured on

00:22:47.082 --> 00:22:52.259
Napoleon's military campaigns
and particularly that of 1805.

00:22:52.259 --> 00:22:58.286
When he organized the French
Free Forces in North Africa in

00:22:58.286 --> 00:23:04.625
'41 he referred to Napoleon's
campaigns that he'd studied very

00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:08.162
carefully.
But he knew also that because

00:23:08.162 --> 00:23:12.328
the French Constitution had been
written--that is the Third

00:23:12.328 --> 00:23:14.798
Republic,
end of the Fourth Republic--had

00:23:14.798 --> 00:23:17.859
been written reflecting the fear
of people like Napoleons,

00:23:17.859 --> 00:23:21.202
the Napoleons,
of Caesarism,

00:23:21.202 --> 00:23:28.753
that he realized that that was
always a possibility and always

00:23:28.753 --> 00:23:35.190
spoke highly of things like
popular sovereignty.

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:39.696
He always used a kind of
appeals to the French masses

00:23:39.696 --> 00:23:44.983
that Napoleon himself had done
so effectively--more about that

00:23:44.983 --> 00:23:48.988
in a minute,
and his sort of plunging into

00:23:48.988 --> 00:23:52.690
the crowds, to the horror of his
guards.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.690
Something happened when
Gorbachev came to the United

00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:59.337
States, and Gorbachev was such
an impressive person and such an

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:03.246
under-appreciated great man.
And Gorbachev just shocked his

00:24:03.246 --> 00:24:07.098
guards by getting out of the
big, black limousine near the

00:24:07.098 --> 00:24:11.490
mall in Washington and sort of
plunging and giving high-fives,

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:15.019
the Russian equivalents of
high-fives, to people in the

00:24:15.019 --> 00:24:18.876
crowd, where the guards were
just scared to death because we

00:24:18.876 --> 00:24:22.117
had lost a Kennedy and all this,
two Kennedys,

00:24:22.117 --> 00:24:24.849
indeed, and because of security
issues.

00:24:24.849 --> 00:24:27.918
And de Gaulle who had survived
these various assassination

00:24:27.918 --> 00:24:31.510
attempts, and one in which,
as I said, just this huge man,

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.368
this car which is riddled by
machineguns, a couple of guys

00:24:35.368 --> 00:24:38.352
firing in Clamart,
and he escapes absolutely

00:24:38.352 --> 00:24:40.834
unscathed.
Napoleon was only wounded three

00:24:40.834 --> 00:24:44.202
times, very lightly.
Napoleon seemed to have this

00:24:44.202 --> 00:24:48.969
view that comes out of saintly
romantic battling figures in the

00:24:48.969 --> 00:24:52.966
medieval times that they
were--that God had made them

00:24:52.966 --> 00:24:56.658
immune to physical danger,
and that if somebody fired in

00:24:56.658 --> 00:24:59.547
the seventeenth century a bullet
at such a person that they could

00:24:59.547 --> 00:25:02.140
catch the bullet,
as if Superman or some

00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.059
ridiculous video thing,
catch them in their teeth.

00:25:06.059 --> 00:25:09.905
But part of this is the popular
appeal of this man who was full

00:25:09.905 --> 00:25:13.946
of famous things that he said.
But he never intended it as

00:25:13.946 --> 00:25:16.277
witticisms;
the man had virtually no sense

00:25:16.277 --> 00:25:19.069
of humor.
He's a cynic but a very smart

00:25:19.069 --> 00:25:20.729
man.
But he's probably best

00:25:20.729 --> 00:25:23.534
remembered for saying,
"how can you possibly run a

00:25:23.534 --> 00:25:26.339
country"--I don't think he used
the word rule,

00:25:26.339 --> 00:25:29.886
that would've been a mistake,
that would've been lapsing to

00:25:29.886 --> 00:25:32.515
the royal we,
which he used constantly--"How

00:25:32.515 --> 00:25:36.490
can you run a country that has
268 different kinds of cheese?

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:40.875
It's all so complex."
In fact, there are many more

00:25:40.875 --> 00:25:45.148
than 268 kinds of cheese;
there's probably 268 different

00:25:45.148 --> 00:25:49.399
kinds of picodons,
which are small goats' cheeses

00:25:49.399 --> 00:25:53.960
produced in the southeast of
France and in other places.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.045
But what organized all this
stuff together in his thinking

00:25:58.045 --> 00:26:01.484
is that France cannot be France
without grandeur,

00:26:01.484 --> 00:26:05.943
without grandeur.
So, one of the compelling

00:26:05.943 --> 00:26:12.559
aspects of his existence was
that how you keep a power,

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:17.115
that is no longer really a
great power, in a world that had

00:26:17.115 --> 00:26:20.099
been divided among two great
powers,

00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:25.724
how you keep a diminished great
power a great power,

00:26:25.724 --> 00:26:29.878
how do you do that?
So, there were two ways,

00:26:29.878 --> 00:26:34.170
very vehemently anti-communist
through the whole thing,

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.973
but more realistic than the
Americans, always more realistic

00:26:36.973 --> 00:26:39.920
than the Americans--and this
we'll tie together in a minute.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.986
Two ways: one is that you
maintain this forceful

00:26:44.986 --> 00:26:51.670
independence vis-à-vis
the Americans and the Soviets.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:54.510
The clash of these two
civilizations,

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:58.692
both with their monumental
exaggerations and both with

00:26:58.692 --> 00:27:02.935
their monumental problems;
the Americans' problems less

00:27:02.935 --> 00:27:06.954
bloody than the traditions in
the Soviet Union--how do you do

00:27:06.954 --> 00:27:09.117
that?
So, you become independent,

00:27:09.117 --> 00:27:11.829
you leave NATO,
you throw the Americans out;

00:27:11.829 --> 00:27:14.852
thus these huge airbases that
were once full of American

00:27:14.852 --> 00:27:17.928
planes, full of American Air
Force people and soldiers in

00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:20.621
Chateauroux and all these
places--I mentioned this

00:27:20.621 --> 00:27:23.484
before--now empty,
just big parking lots

00:27:23.484 --> 00:27:25.517
essentially.
You can still see them all over

00:27:25.517 --> 00:27:27.273
the place.
Or Lyon, there's another good

00:27:27.273 --> 00:27:29.294
one.
You're independent,

00:27:29.294 --> 00:27:34.084
and you insist on having the
force de frappe,

00:27:34.084 --> 00:27:37.418
force,
like force, and then de,

00:27:37.418 --> 00:27:40.789
d-e, and then frappe,
f-r-a-p-p-e;

00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:43.893
and frappe,
it sounds like something that's

00:27:43.893 --> 00:27:47.376
served at Coffee Too or
Starbucks, but it is the nuclear

00:27:47.376 --> 00:27:50.138
capacity.
And, so, France is going to be

00:27:50.138 --> 00:27:53.369
independent, it's going to have
nuclear capacity.

00:27:53.369 --> 00:27:56.165
The Americans had the atomic
bomb, the Soviet Union had the

00:27:56.165 --> 00:27:58.129
atomic bomb.
The Americans had used an

00:27:58.129 --> 00:28:01.557
atomic bomb.
The Israelis probably did not

00:28:01.557 --> 00:28:06.788
yet have the atomic bomb but
soon would, and India would

00:28:06.788 --> 00:28:11.733
later and the Pakistanis and as
you know the Chinese,

00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:15.779
as well.
So, that leads to point number

00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:20.930
two, that is by being
independent and by being French,

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:25.503
that you maintain your
influence in places even as they

00:28:25.503 --> 00:28:29.059
are being decolonized--places
like Mali,

00:28:29.059 --> 00:28:31.638
for example,
or Senegal, or ex-Zaire,

00:28:31.638 --> 00:28:35.722
the Congo, which was the awful
Leopold's private territory

00:28:35.722 --> 00:28:39.949
before the Belgian parliament
took it over at the end of the

00:28:39.949 --> 00:28:43.782
nineteenth century,
the beginning of the twentieth

00:28:43.782 --> 00:28:47.527
century, because of just the
massacres, the slaughter of

00:28:47.527 --> 00:28:51.000
local people by sort of Belgian
mercenary types,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.470
and all of this;
that these places,

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.352
that even after Algeria,
and before that Morocco and

00:28:57.352 --> 00:28:59.887
Tunisia,
become independent that the

00:28:59.887 --> 00:29:03.660
influence of la belle
France in places like Vietnam,

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.879
after the French leave,
because of French civilization,

00:29:06.879 --> 00:29:10.159
the civilizing mission,
the French language-- Lebanon,

00:29:10.159 --> 00:29:13.500
another very good example,
French influence in Lebanon,

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:17.484
terribly, terribly important.
And that this kind of

00:29:17.484 --> 00:29:23.395
influence, a cultural influence
and a political influence of

00:29:23.395 --> 00:29:29.307
being an honest broker between
these two big colossal powers

00:29:29.307 --> 00:29:35.519
will help accentuate France's
existence as a great power,

00:29:35.519 --> 00:29:37.720
continued to exist as a great
power.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:40.489
But there was a contradiction
there because France was no

00:29:40.489 --> 00:29:43.210
longer a great power,
but wanted to be a great power.

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:49.801
And, so, that was essential in
the way that de Gaulle viewed

00:29:49.801 --> 00:29:54.269
France's role and personally his
role;

00:29:54.269 --> 00:29:58.310
that France would maintain its
influence in what they called in

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:02.372
those days the Third World,
tiers monde,

00:30:02.372 --> 00:30:08.773
that were--had just been freed
from the colonial imperial

00:30:08.773 --> 00:30:14.490
experience but were economically
disadvantaged.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:18.046
And that France's historical
mission of carrying

00:30:18.046 --> 00:30:20.769
civilization,
French civilization,

00:30:20.769 --> 00:30:24.055
the civilizing mission,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:30:24.055 --> 00:30:28.922
would continue in that context.
Now, you even saw this very

00:30:28.922 --> 00:30:34.173
recently in the case of the
Bulgarian nurses who had been in

00:30:34.173 --> 00:30:38.890
Libya accused of--it's a
terribly complicated case--of

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:42.450
infecting Libyan children with
HIV,

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:49.007
and who had been condemned to
death and had been in prison for

00:30:49.007 --> 00:30:51.744
I don't remember how long.
And one of the first things

00:30:51.744 --> 00:30:54.719
that Sarkozy does is he sends
his wife, who's no longer his

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:58.430
wife,
to Libya to use the influence,

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:04.369
that old French influence,
in the Middle East to obtain

00:31:04.369 --> 00:31:08.880
the release of these Bulgarian
nurses.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.240
And indeed they were able to
pull that off.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:13.362
I think one of the nurses was
Palestinian but I think the

00:31:13.362 --> 00:31:15.559
other ones were Bulgarian,
I'm sure they were Bulgarian;

00:31:15.559 --> 00:31:18.250
I'm not sure about the
Palestinian but I think so.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:21.367
And it works.
But this is an idea that we can

00:31:21.367 --> 00:31:24.894
be there, we can intervene in
these cases and get things

00:31:24.894 --> 00:31:28.288
happened because of that.
And no one--if you travel in

00:31:28.288 --> 00:31:31.370
Africa and in Francophone
countries, nobody should have

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:34.795
any illusion about the continued
influence of France in these

00:31:34.795 --> 00:31:36.262
places;
and it is very,

00:31:36.262 --> 00:31:38.557
very important,
and this is something that de

00:31:38.557 --> 00:31:42.628
Gaulle believed very much.
He feared the domination of

00:31:42.628 --> 00:31:47.365
Europe and France by Britain and
the United States,

00:31:47.365 --> 00:31:52.269
using NATO as a tool.
And, so, you can argue now that

00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:56.509
Europe, quote/unquote Europe,
the European Union,

00:31:56.509 --> 00:32:00.365
the European community and all
this stuff, that the basis of

00:32:00.365 --> 00:32:04.220
this lies certainly in what
would've seemed in the 1920s and

00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:07.289
the '30s,
or for that matter the 1880s

00:32:07.289 --> 00:32:11.727
and '90s, a horribly unusual
alliance between Germany and

00:32:11.727 --> 00:32:14.431
France.
And de Gaulle moves in that

00:32:14.431 --> 00:32:17.655
direction.
And, so, that is a way

00:32:17.655 --> 00:32:24.657
of--working against is the wrong
term--but sort of circumventing

00:32:24.657 --> 00:32:28.770
the kind of domination of the
U.S.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:36.547
and of Britain in all of this.
And what he helps do--and this

00:32:36.547 --> 00:32:41.970
is very important--is it ends
all that animosity between

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.682
Germany and France.
I can remember going up to the

00:32:45.682 --> 00:32:47.533
Normandy beaches,
the Norman beaches,

00:32:47.533 --> 00:32:50.053
and try waiting in
there--imagine all these people

00:32:50.053 --> 00:32:52.109
shooting at you on the 6th of
June,

00:32:52.109 --> 00:32:53.991
1944 when you go to Omaha
Beach, or Utah Beach,

00:32:53.991 --> 00:32:55.995
or one of these places,
and it's full of Americans

00:32:55.995 --> 00:32:58.687
going there;
it's full of very old Americans

00:32:58.687 --> 00:33:02.500
going there, to see where they
had lost a lot of friends.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.926
But I remember going there with
German plates--this is in the

00:33:07.926 --> 00:33:12.630
early 1970s--and still getting
stares and insults,

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:14.869
that I could understand
perfectly well;

00:33:14.869 --> 00:33:17.450
they thought we were German,
and we weren't,

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.630
we were your age and just kind
of traveling around,

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:23.084
and sleeping on beaches,
and eating a little,

00:33:23.084 --> 00:33:25.260
and drinking some wine along
the way,

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:29.085
and all that stuff.
But de Gaulle helped put an end

00:33:29.085 --> 00:33:31.843
to that, and now if you ask
almost anybody,

00:33:31.843 --> 00:33:35.585
if you ask one of the Germans
going into Strasbourg to buy

00:33:35.585 --> 00:33:39.379
foie gras,
or all the French going over to

00:33:39.379 --> 00:33:43.170
Germany to buy what is slightly
cheaper gasoline,

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:46.468
this is an alliance,
and a cornerstone of Europe,

00:33:46.468 --> 00:33:50.384
particularly given the attitude
of the British and all the

00:33:50.384 --> 00:33:54.369
anxieties that they have about
losing their integrity,

00:33:54.369 --> 00:33:57.285
national integrity,
of losing the pound and all

00:33:57.285 --> 00:34:02.369
that stuff.
And, so, de Gaulle helped make

00:34:02.369 --> 00:34:07.093
that possible.
He never forgot the humiliation

00:34:07.093 --> 00:34:12.113
of France having been excluded
from the Allied conferences at

00:34:12.113 --> 00:34:17.122
Yalta and Potsdam.
You've all seen those pictures

00:34:17.122 --> 00:34:23.410
of Stalin with Churchill and
sometimes Roosevelt as well.

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:27.595
But France was not invited.
Both Roosevelt and Churchill

00:34:27.595 --> 00:34:31.300
just hated de Gaulle's guts,
they hated his arrogance.

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:35.427
And he was not a person who
lacked confidence,

00:34:35.427 --> 00:34:40.840
and he was not rigolo,
he was not a good-time guy.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.661
His own family,
by the way, his own family

00:34:43.661 --> 00:34:46.690
vous-vous-ed him,
his children did.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:49.381
They didn't use tu they
used vous--that's

00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:51.908
amazing.
And they hated him,

00:34:51.908 --> 00:34:55.949
they had contempt for him.
And de Gaulle never forgot

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:58.535
those personal humiliations and
the humiliations that la

00:34:58.535 --> 00:35:00.267
France,
great power,

00:35:00.267 --> 00:35:05.436
was not invited to participate
in essentially the fate of

00:35:05.436 --> 00:35:08.640
Europe.
And, so, that leads to 1966,

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:13.282
France withdrawing from NATO by
forcing it to transfer its

00:35:13.282 --> 00:35:16.539
headquarters from Paris to
Bruxelles,

00:35:16.539 --> 00:35:19.134
to Brussels,
and these army and air force

00:35:19.134 --> 00:35:22.480
bases in France were closed;
and armed forces radio was

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.713
moved away, so it became more
difficult to listen to football

00:35:25.713 --> 00:35:28.891
games on armed forces radio
because you had to get them from

00:35:28.891 --> 00:35:31.313
Frankfurt,
which is an extraordinarily

00:35:31.313 --> 00:35:34.590
minor point.
And again he insisted on the

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:38.520
development of an arsenal that
was nuclear.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.412
And he angered the U.S.
government by refusing to

00:35:41.412 --> 00:35:43.949
support the U.S.
policies in Vietnam.

00:35:43.949 --> 00:35:47.989
And of course the French had
already seen how stupid policies

00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:51.529
lead to bad results.
But the Americans did not see

00:35:51.529 --> 00:35:55.576
that, for a very long time,
until 70,000 American soldiers

00:35:55.576 --> 00:36:00.119
and God-knows how many people in
Vietnam died in all of this.

00:36:00.119 --> 00:36:01.760
He outraged--and I remember
this;

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.493
I wasn't in Quebec--but he went
to Quebec on a state visit,

00:36:05.493 --> 00:36:08.969
and he suddenly blurts out,
"long live free Quebec!"

00:36:08.969 --> 00:36:12.030
And, so, this caused all sorts
of problems.

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:16.219
This was in the late-- it was
about 1967, if I remember

00:36:16.219 --> 00:36:18.940
correctly.
Why free Quebec?

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:22.794
Because Quebec is nouvelle
France, and that's where you

00:36:22.794 --> 00:36:26.079
had 60,000 French men,
women, and children living.

00:36:26.079 --> 00:36:30.178
At the time there were 2.5
million English people living in

00:36:30.178 --> 00:36:34.559
what was the colonies in the
U.S., and a very one-sided war.

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:36.627
But again the idea that if
Quebec is free,

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:39.553
if it's independent--my own
personal view is it ought to be

00:36:39.553 --> 00:36:41.380
independent;
ça n'a rien à

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.440
voir avec.
But it's just my feeling,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:47.159
but I don't know enough about
it to say that's a good idea,

00:36:47.159 --> 00:36:49.842
but I have the same kind of
cultural feelings that he does

00:36:49.842 --> 00:36:51.585
about it.
But this is not what you do,

00:36:51.585 --> 00:36:54.298
you do not go on a state visit
and suddenly announce "long live

00:36:54.298 --> 00:36:56.690
Quebec!"
Americans, this is the same

00:36:56.690 --> 00:36:59.662
thing, if somebody came from,
I don't know,

00:36:59.662 --> 00:37:04.049
a Serb ambassador or an Italian
prime minister suddenly arrives

00:37:04.049 --> 00:37:06.847
and says,
"long live free New Mexico and

00:37:06.847 --> 00:37:09.001
Texas!"
or something like that--people

00:37:09.001 --> 00:37:13.842
didn't view it very well.
But although he was vehemently

00:37:13.842 --> 00:37:19.043
anti-communist,
he did not want--he saw himself

00:37:19.043 --> 00:37:25.263
as again this honest broker in
negotiating between these

00:37:25.263 --> 00:37:28.985
powers.
His legacy were of these

00:37:28.985 --> 00:37:34.400
imperatives that he had;
they were backed by deeds or at

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:39.159
least attempts to restore the
grandeur of France,

00:37:39.159 --> 00:37:42.264
its efficient,
kind of active independence,

00:37:42.264 --> 00:37:45.960
as I guess Stanley Hoffmann
called it that once.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:50.899
And this diverged from other
parts of the French Right--Le

00:37:50.899 --> 00:37:53.311
Figaro magazine,
for example,

00:37:53.311 --> 00:37:56.218
which is always just almost
comically pro-American on every

00:37:56.218 --> 00:37:58.858
issue.
The French Right couldn't--what

00:37:58.858 --> 00:38:02.739
de Gaulle did is he took the
nationalism of Napoleons,

00:38:02.739 --> 00:38:05.175
the Napoleons,
which was a nationalism

00:38:05.175 --> 00:38:08.993
associated with the general
liberal Left--the State will do

00:38:08.993 --> 00:38:12.811
good things for people--he
transforms that in the evolution

00:38:12.811 --> 00:38:15.510
that you see in the Third
Republic,

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.721
the nationalism,
moving to the nationalism of

00:38:18.721 --> 00:38:23.246
the Right, into the equivalent
of the Sacred Union of World War

00:38:23.246 --> 00:38:25.933
One,
into a nationalism,

00:38:25.933 --> 00:38:31.690
fundamentally a nationalism of
the Right in France.

00:38:31.690 --> 00:38:34.665
And part of that,
to make a long story short,

00:38:34.665 --> 00:38:37.505
as you already have seen,
is based upon his

00:38:37.505 --> 00:38:40.446
anti-communism.
But at the same time you have

00:38:40.446 --> 00:38:43.472
all this business about grandeur
and glory, et cetera,

00:38:43.472 --> 00:38:45.699
et cetera--grandeur more than
glory;

00:38:45.699 --> 00:38:49.898
but inattention to--even at the
end of what's called the

00:38:49.898 --> 00:38:53.645
glorious thirty years,
the French economy takes off,

00:38:53.645 --> 00:38:56.618
that you've read
about--inattention to how you

00:38:56.618 --> 00:38:59.357
modernize France,
how you make it more

00:38:59.357 --> 00:39:03.112
economically competitive,
and what do you do about the

00:39:03.112 --> 00:39:06.723
education system,
the university system in

00:39:06.723 --> 00:39:10.142
particular?
And that would come crashing

00:39:10.142 --> 00:39:13.923
down on his head in 1968.
So, his deeds,

00:39:13.923 --> 00:39:20.417
his legacy in--I've already
said I think what there is to

00:39:20.417 --> 00:39:26.679
say about the practical
consequences of his legacy.

00:39:26.679 --> 00:39:30.380
But he did, France's influence
did remain, has remained in the

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:33.050
world, which I think is a very
good thing.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.699
But the most,
the greatest legacy that he

00:39:35.699 --> 00:39:39.012
left is probably his style,
that of the monarchical

00:39:39.012 --> 00:39:42.345
president,
the monarchial president,

00:39:42.345 --> 00:39:47.446
the king of the republic,
the idea that he represented

00:39:47.446 --> 00:39:53.219
France in a way that the Sun
King had represented France,

00:39:53.219 --> 00:39:57.515
towering over France,
and that overriding the

00:39:57.515 --> 00:40:02.300
interests of those he considered
to be talkers,

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:06.129
mere posers or talkers,
including technocrats,

00:40:06.129 --> 00:40:11.150
the kinds of people who had
emerged in part out of World War

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:14.469
Two and out of the Fourth
Republic.

00:40:14.469 --> 00:40:18.573
And, so, he left unsolved the
question of how you educate

00:40:18.573 --> 00:40:22.383
France for a new society,
how you train and modernize

00:40:22.383 --> 00:40:24.602
people.
What do you do with the

00:40:24.602 --> 00:40:28.349
poisonous relations between a
very powerful patronat,

00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:32.324
that is employers,
and a working class that in the

00:40:32.324 --> 00:40:36.380
1960s was still extremely
influenced by the CGT,

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.153
the Confédération
Général du

00:40:39.153 --> 00:40:41.070
Travail, and by the Communist
Party?

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:44.632
So, there were contradictions
in all of this,

00:40:44.632 --> 00:40:49.652
the idea that France is a great
power when France still--France

00:40:49.652 --> 00:40:53.786
wasn't yet a great power.
The idea that France can be

00:40:53.786 --> 00:40:57.558
independent and therefore
maintain itself as a great power

00:40:57.558 --> 00:41:00.241
by intervening,
in terms of its cultural

00:41:00.241 --> 00:41:03.722
influence, its political
influence in the Third World and

00:41:03.722 --> 00:41:05.702
that sort of thing.
And the reality,

00:41:05.702 --> 00:41:07.577
when push came to shove,
that there were two great

00:41:07.577 --> 00:41:09.590
powers.
So, it kind of,

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:15.339
the contradictions are there.
He said over and over again

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:19.579
that he was not of the Left nor
of the Right;

00:41:19.579 --> 00:41:24.001
he was above the Left or the
Right--he used the "above" word,

00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:28.966
the word "above" all the time.
He said "je suis un homme de

00:41:28.966 --> 00:41:32.413
la guerre de
quatorze/dix-huit"--I'm a

00:41:32.413 --> 00:41:36.284
man of the War of 1914-1918;
he was wounded on Belgian

00:41:36.284 --> 00:41:38.460
Bridge in Dinant,
as I said the other day.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:43.986
And that was the Sacred Union,
when in the interests of France

00:41:43.986 --> 00:41:49.784
these quarreling fragments would
give up their quarrels with each

00:41:49.784 --> 00:41:55.583
other and would rally around big
France--that France's historical

00:41:55.583 --> 00:42:01.110
mission was so especially said
on the 11th of December,

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:06.231
1969, "I don't want to repose,
I don't want to even triumph,

00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:09.269
I want to bring people
together."

00:42:09.269 --> 00:42:15.110
He saw his own party as being
above these.

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:18.732
He said that the parties--in
1965--he said parties are

00:42:18.732 --> 00:42:22.697
organizations constituted to
show off particular tendencies

00:42:22.697 --> 00:42:26.661
and to support the interests of
such and such categories of

00:42:26.661 --> 00:42:28.629
people,
or interests,

00:42:28.629 --> 00:42:33.030
or desires, and all this stuff,
time and time again.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:37.361
But he wasn't just someone who
was going to pronounce

00:42:37.361 --> 00:42:42.110
foolishly, revert to the same
eventually tired phrases,

00:42:42.110 --> 00:42:46.636
he was somebody who believed
that he could pay particular

00:42:46.636 --> 00:42:50.432
attention to circumstances.
In this he was rather like

00:42:50.432 --> 00:42:53.729
Bismarck, and saw himself in
that way, I think it's possible

00:42:53.729 --> 00:42:56.315
to argue.
In this maybe he saw himself a

00:42:56.315 --> 00:42:59.379
little bit, though I hate to
make the comparison,

00:42:59.379 --> 00:43:02.379
but maybe with Henry Kissinger
a little bit too,

00:43:02.379 --> 00:43:05.647
in the old days.
But one of the results of the

00:43:05.647 --> 00:43:09.767
way he viewed France is that he
didn't really give a damn about

00:43:09.767 --> 00:43:12.159
the existence of ordinary
people.

00:43:12.159 --> 00:43:16.068
He once said that--he said this
literally--"steak

00:43:16.068 --> 00:43:19.670
frites," that is steak with
French fries,

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:23.570
"is okay, it's fine,
but it does not add up to

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:27.889
national ambition";
that's an exact quote.

00:43:27.889 --> 00:43:32.408
And the business of how do you
bring together,

00:43:32.408 --> 00:43:37.630
how do you retain the
importance of a people with 268

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:42.349
kinds of cheese,
was a part of all of that.

00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:50.650
And, so, his style was more
original than his doctrine.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.539
Take the press conference--he
used to have press conferences.

00:43:53.539 --> 00:43:55.672
American presidents often have
press conferences,

00:43:55.672 --> 00:43:58.248
though the current one really
doesn't because the questions

00:43:58.248 --> 00:44:01.327
get too difficult to handle.
But de Gaulle wasn't one for

00:44:01.327 --> 00:44:03.221
press conferences,
he hated them,

00:44:03.221 --> 00:44:05.989
he couldn't stand them.
But the press conferences in

00:44:05.989 --> 00:44:08.360
the old day were orchestrated,
they were appearances.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.398
They were not a rock concert
appearance, but they were

00:44:11.398 --> 00:44:14.552
appearances nonetheless,
in which the questions had been

00:44:14.552 --> 00:44:16.186
planted.
It was rather like FEMA,

00:44:16.186 --> 00:44:18.592
whatever they called it--did an
amazing thing just a couple of

00:44:18.592 --> 00:44:21.061
weeks in California,
they planted--the people in the

00:44:21.061 --> 00:44:23.530
room weren't reporters they were
FEMA employees,

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.893
and they presented it as a
press conference where one guy

00:44:25.893 --> 00:44:28.321
raised his hand and he said,
"why is FEMA doing such a

00:44:28.321 --> 00:44:29.900
remarkable job this time
around?"

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.622
And then the guy says,
"well, I think we're very doing

00:44:31.622 --> 00:44:32.760
well, thank you for saying
that."

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.733
It turned out that he was an
employee of FEMA and there

00:44:34.733 --> 00:44:37.229
weren't real journalists there.
But de Gaulle would do the same

00:44:37.229 --> 00:44:39.349
thing except he would do it with
real journalists;

00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:41.618
he wouldn't do it with Helen
Thomas, who was a wonderful

00:44:41.618 --> 00:44:43.309
person.
I once had her as a guest at

00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:45.557
the tea in Branford;
she was always able to ask the

00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:47.442
first question--I don't think
this is the case

00:44:47.442 --> 00:44:49.369
anymore--because she was the
senior person.

00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:52.374
But you had real journalists,
but they were told what

00:44:52.374 --> 00:44:55.147
questions to ask,
and then he would say--he would

00:44:55.147 --> 00:44:58.787
give the same kinds of responses
that I just said--"steak-frites

00:44:58.787 --> 00:45:01.329
do not end up with national
ambition."

00:45:01.329 --> 00:45:04.542
At the time of the Algerian War
somebody forgot to ask a

00:45:04.542 --> 00:45:07.576
question about Ben Bella.
So, he said--he suddenly looks

00:45:07.576 --> 00:45:10.150
up and says, "did I hear
somebody ask a question about

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:12.547
Ben Bella?"
And then he gives the response,

00:45:12.547 --> 00:45:15.538
but he turns and reads a
response that had already been

00:45:15.538 --> 00:45:17.809
written for him,
and sometimes by him.

00:45:17.809 --> 00:45:21.030
And, so, it was the kind of
style.

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:25.130
So, appearances were important,
the idea that somehow this

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:29.087
mystical body was connected in a
real way to all of you,

00:45:29.087 --> 00:45:32.808
by national glory.
And when he would go to any

00:45:32.808 --> 00:45:37.639
town, and he liked doing that,
he would go and he would say,

00:45:37.639 --> 00:45:41.670
"as I stand in the shadow of
your magnificent cathedral," or

00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:45.291
"next to your smiling
river"--French rivers are always

00:45:45.291 --> 00:45:48.853
described as smiling,
even if they're polluted,

00:45:48.853 --> 00:45:51.693
by politicians.
"I am thinking of you,

00:45:51.693 --> 00:45:54.623
and seeing you here,
here to welcome me,

00:45:54.623 --> 00:45:59.056
your hearts beating just as
mine for France and its grandeur

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:02.815
and its civilization,
I am reminded that"--and then

00:46:02.815 --> 00:46:05.679
he launches into his two or
three minute bit.

00:46:05.679 --> 00:46:08.799
And then he is in the big
limousine and out of

00:46:08.799 --> 00:46:11.849
Lussac-les-Deux-Eglises or
wherever it is.

00:46:11.849 --> 00:46:16.186
And it all was like that,
where style increasingly

00:46:16.186 --> 00:46:20.788
overwhelmed substance,
and in a man who was extremely

00:46:20.788 --> 00:46:23.109
elderly,
but by no means,

00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:25.550
by no means senile,
not one bit,

00:46:25.550 --> 00:46:30.195
and who could still treat with
contempt anybody who came and

00:46:30.195 --> 00:46:34.447
told him something he didn't
want to hear--but could be

00:46:34.447 --> 00:46:39.250
charming as well--the stage was
set for his departure,

00:46:39.250 --> 00:46:44.178
as time moved on.
And that would swirl around the

00:46:44.178 --> 00:46:46.817
events of 1968,
la revolution

00:46:46.817 --> 00:46:50.528
manquée,
the revolution that didn't

00:46:50.528 --> 00:46:54.629
really happen in France and
involved an awful lot of people

00:46:54.629 --> 00:46:56.605
of your age.
And it's to that,

00:46:56.605 --> 00:46:59.461
after I hope a glorious
weekend, that I will return on

00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:00.461
Monday.

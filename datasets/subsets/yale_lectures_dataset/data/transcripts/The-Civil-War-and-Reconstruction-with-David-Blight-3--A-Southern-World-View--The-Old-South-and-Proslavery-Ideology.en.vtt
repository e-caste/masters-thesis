00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:07.382
Professor David Blight:
In a speech before the Virginia

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:11.258
Secession Convention,
in 1861, in late April,

00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:15.819
in the wake of the firing on
Fort Sumter, the newly

00:00:15.819 --> 00:00:20.199
elected--sort of
appointed--Vice-President of the

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.704
Confederacy,
Alexander H.

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:27.395
Stephens, gave a speech that
became quickly known to history

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:32.610
as his "Cornerstone Speech."
This is Spring, 1861.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.890
Alexander H.
Stephens, a Georgian,

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.930
a slaveholder,
an old friend and colleague of

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.107
Abraham Lincoln's,
ironically, said the

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:45.666
cornerstone of the Confederacy,
the cornerstone of their

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:50.232
political movement,
was what he called "American

00:00:50.232 --> 00:00:54.843
Negro slavery."
It was the cornerstone on which

00:00:54.843 --> 00:00:58.280
they had founded their
revolution.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.820
The quote goes on:
"As a race, the African is

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.682
inferior to the white man.
Subordination to the white man

00:01:08.682 --> 00:01:14.056
is his normal condition.
He is not his equal by nature

00:01:14.056 --> 00:01:19.950
and cannot be made so by human
laws or human institutions.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.068
Our system, therefore,
so far as regards this inferior

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:30.380
race, rests upon this great
immutable law of nature."

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.218
You always have to get worried
in history when people start

00:01:42.218 --> 00:01:49.943
talking about how human beings
or human behavior is rooted in

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.528
nature.
But how do we get to 1861 and

00:01:53.528 --> 00:01:56.370
that secession crisis with
Alexander H.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.586
Stephens delivering this
Cornerstone Speech,

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:02.652
declaring that,
"Hey folks, it's all about

00:02:02.652 --> 00:02:07.230
slavery and its preservation?"
How did we get there?

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.626
Today I want to talk about,
we're going to dwell on,

00:02:11.626 --> 00:02:15.677
ultimately, the Southern
defense of slavery--the

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:19.470
arguments over time that they
developed,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.043
layer upon layer,
drawing upon earlier arguments

00:02:23.043 --> 00:02:26.616
and building them into new
ones--sometimes quite

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:30.949
original--toward ultimately a
virtually utopian defense of

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:35.107
slavery as a perfecting,
perfectible,

00:02:35.107 --> 00:02:41.003
if not perfected system.
Now, I want to say one other

00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:44.120
quick thing before we get to the
substance.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.838
A thousand times in a thousand
ways anybody who studies the

00:02:48.838 --> 00:02:52.499
American Civil War period is
inevitably asked,

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.552
"so what caused this war?"
It's, of course,

00:02:55.552 --> 00:02:57.390
the question of the first third
of this course.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.202
So what caused it?
Yesterday, on M.L.

00:03:00.202 --> 00:03:03.977
King Day, I had the privilege
of being on at least four radio

00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:07.689
programs about this new book I
have out called A Slave No

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.960
More,
some of them quite terrific.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.900
Minnesota Public Radio does a
fabulous hour-long program.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.824
But one of them was on a
Nashville, Tennessee radio

00:03:17.824 --> 00:03:19.930
station, on a program at 5:30
p.m.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.909
called "Drive Time."
And the host was Harry or Pete

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.310
or whoever he was--I've been on
too many of these.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.042
The first question was,
"So Professor,

00:03:32.042 --> 00:03:37.142
what was the Civil War about?"
Now do that in a sound byte on

00:03:37.142 --> 00:03:40.949
a national radio station when
you got two minutes to answer.

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.805
"Well Pete, you see,
there was this free labor

00:03:44.805 --> 00:03:49.860
system and this slave labor
system," blah-blah blah-blah.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.008
I tried to sound byte this and
I ended up saying something

00:03:53.008 --> 00:03:56.157
silly like, "You know Pete,
I'm teaching a whole course on

00:03:56.157 --> 00:03:56.710
this."

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.083
And I finally just ended that
particular little exchange

00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:09.905
before he went on to rant at me
about all that's wrong with

00:04:09.905 --> 00:04:14.010
American education by saying,
"Pete, it was slavery."

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.782
[laughs]
In Alexis de Tocqueville's

00:04:20.782 --> 00:04:24.014
great Democracy in
America, which he published

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.326
in 1831,
or published in 1837,

00:04:26.326 --> 00:04:30.578
after his famous nine-month
tour of the United States--the

00:04:30.578 --> 00:04:33.276
most famous book,
travel book,

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:37.699
ever written about America,
by a foreigner.

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:41.724
In Democracy in America
there's that famous passage,

00:04:41.724 --> 00:04:44.499
or passages,
when Tocqueville crosses the

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.575
Ohio River,
from Ohio into Kentucky,

00:04:47.575 --> 00:04:52.920
from free soil into slave soil,
free state into a slave state.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.202
Tocqueville,
you may know,

00:04:54.202 --> 00:04:57.025
didn't spend a great deal of
time in the South though he

00:04:57.025 --> 00:05:01.002
traveled all across the South.
He spent at least two-thirds of

00:05:01.002 --> 00:05:04.026
his--more than,
about three-quarters of his

00:05:04.026 --> 00:05:08.644
time--in the northern states.
But when he crossed into

00:05:08.644 --> 00:05:13.079
Kentucky, he wrote this letter
to his father.

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:16.498
"For the first time"--this was,
of course, the French

00:05:16.498 --> 00:05:20.509
aristocrat de Tocqueville--"For
the first time we have had the

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.059
chance to examine the effect
that slavery produces on a

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.265
society.
On the right bank of the Ohio

00:05:27.265 --> 00:05:31.207
everything is activity,
industry, labor is honored,

00:05:31.207 --> 00:05:35.154
there are no slaves.
Pass to the left bank and the

00:05:35.154 --> 00:05:39.644
scene changes so suddenly that
you think yourself on the other

00:05:39.644 --> 00:05:45.051
side of the world.
The enterprising spirit seems

00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:48.265
gone.
There work is not only painful,

00:05:48.265 --> 00:05:51.460
it's shameful,
and you degrade yourself in

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.657
submitting yourself to it.
To ride, to hunt,

00:05:55.657 --> 00:06:02.382
to smoke like a Turk in the
sunshine, there's the destiny of

00:06:02.382 --> 00:06:07.600
the white man.
To do any other kind of manual

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:13.435
labor is to act like a slave."
Now, Tocqueville was of course

00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:18.082
responding from his own kind of
French aristocratic heart,

00:06:18.082 --> 00:06:21.364
to some extent.
He was drawn in a bit to

00:06:21.364 --> 00:06:25.572
certain kinds of Southern charm.
"The whites," he said,

00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:28.841
"of the South,
form a veritable aristocracy

00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:33.044
which combines many prejudices
with high sentiments and

00:06:33.044 --> 00:06:35.954
instincts."
He probably over-judged the

00:06:35.954 --> 00:06:37.620
scale of that aristocracy.

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:44.620
"They say, and I am much
inclined to believe," said

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.165
Tocqueville, "that in the matter
of honor these men practice

00:06:49.165 --> 00:06:53.170
delicacies and refinements
unknown in the North.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:58.865
They are frank,
hospitable and put many things

00:06:58.865 --> 00:07:03.079
before money."
Well, they'd have loved that.

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:06.591
When we start hearing from our
pro-slavery advocates and

00:07:06.591 --> 00:07:08.889
writers--they would've loved
that.

00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:12.570
Because one of the critiques
that slavery allowed pro-slavery

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.497
writers, ultimately,
to make, was a critique of a

00:07:16.497 --> 00:07:21.100
certain kind of capitalism,
the greedy, grinding,

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:29.365
aggressive, malicious kind of
capitalism they believed the

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:33.783
North embodied.
But charm alone didn't seem to

00:07:33.783 --> 00:07:36.910
make a great society,
according to Tocqueville.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:41.096
"You see few churches and no
schools here in the south," he

00:07:41.096 --> 00:07:44.674
observed.
"Society, like the individual,

00:07:44.674 --> 00:07:49.480
seems to provide nothing."
The South would end,

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.310
he said, by being dominated by
the North.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:58.881
"Every day the latter grows
more wealthy and densely

00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:04.259
populated while the South is
stationary and growing poor."

00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:07.692
Not entirely accurate about
that either, from what we now

00:08:07.692 --> 00:08:11.554
know about the profitability of
slavery and the profitability of

00:08:11.554 --> 00:08:16.400
the cotton crop.
But he ends that famous section

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.071
with this passage.
It is kind of haunting when you

00:08:21.071 --> 00:08:25.736
think it's only 1831 when he
writes this, and that Civil War

00:08:25.736 --> 00:08:29.848
is still 30 years away:
"Slavery brutalizes the black

00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:33.170
population and debilitates the
white.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:37.100
Man is not made for servitude."

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:46.313
Now, in the South what
developed--and let's define it

00:08:46.313 --> 00:08:53.578
at least quickly--what developed
was one of the world's handful

00:08:53.578 --> 00:08:59.169
of true slave societies.
What is a slave society?

00:08:59.169 --> 00:09:05.480
What do we mean when we use
that phrase 'slave society'?

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.966
Essentially,
it means any society where

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:15.279
slave labor--where the
definition of labor,

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:20.521
where the definition of the
relationship between ownership

00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:23.740
and labor--is defined by
slavery.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.603
By a cradle to grave--and some
would've even said a cradle to

00:09:28.603 --> 00:09:32.812
grave and beyond--human bondage.
Where slavery affected

00:09:32.812 --> 00:09:36.196
everything about society.
Where whites and blacks,

00:09:36.196 --> 00:09:40.363
in this case--in America in a
racialized slavery system--grew

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:42.841
up,
were socialized by,

00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:47.722
married, reared children,
worked, invested in,

00:09:47.722 --> 00:09:52.169
and conceived of the idea of
property,

00:09:52.169 --> 00:09:58.084
and honed their most basic
habits and values under the

00:09:58.084 --> 00:10:04.669
influence of a system that said
it was just to own people as

00:10:04.669 --> 00:10:07.919
property.
The other slave societies in

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.710
human history--and you can get
up a real debate over this,

00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:15.202
especially among Africanists,
Brazilianists,

00:10:15.202 --> 00:10:19.344
Asianists and others,
and it's why slavery is such a

00:10:19.344 --> 00:10:23.729
hot field in international
history--but the other great

00:10:23.729 --> 00:10:28.684
slave societies in history where
the whole social structure of

00:10:28.684 --> 00:10:32.420
those societies was rooted in
slavery,

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:37.363
were Ancient Greece and Rome;
certainly Brazil by the

00:10:37.363 --> 00:10:40.549
eighteenth and nineteenth
century;

00:10:40.549 --> 00:10:44.730
the whole of Caribbean--the
Great West Indies

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.529
sugar-producing empires of the
French,

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:52.931
the British,
the Dutch, the Spanish,

00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:58.340
and a few others--and the
American South.

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:01.923
Now, there were other localized
slave societies,

00:11:01.923 --> 00:11:04.043
surely;
certainly within Africa,

00:11:04.043 --> 00:11:07.747
to a certain degree even before
Europeans arrived and certainly

00:11:07.747 --> 00:11:10.386
after Europeans arrived,
particularly after the

00:11:10.386 --> 00:11:12.440
regularization of the Atlantic
slave trade.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.769
There were certain localized
slave societies in East Africa,

00:11:16.769 --> 00:11:20.219
out of Zanzibar by the
eighteenth and nineteenth

00:11:20.219 --> 00:11:22.836
century.
There were certain localized

00:11:22.836 --> 00:11:26.620
slave societies in the vast Arab
world, in the Muslim world,

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:32.612
well before there was even an
Atlantic slave trade to the

00:11:32.612 --> 00:11:35.973
Americas.
But the five great slave

00:11:35.973 --> 00:11:42.166
societies were those five.
All were highly profitable in

00:11:42.166 --> 00:11:47.062
their primes.
All tended to hinder

00:11:47.062 --> 00:11:54.019
technological innovation in
those societies.

00:11:54.019 --> 00:12:01.062
All tended to have a high
slave-to-free ratio of

00:12:01.062 --> 00:12:05.173
population.
All of those slave societies

00:12:05.173 --> 00:12:09.345
had a population of slaves that
was from one-quarter to

00:12:09.345 --> 00:12:13.750
one-half, and sometimes more,
of the total population.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:21.599
In those slave societies,
slaves--as an interest,

00:12:21.599 --> 00:12:30.921
as an interest--were both a
political and a great economic

00:12:30.921 --> 00:12:37.790
institution that defined ways of
life.

00:12:40.879 --> 00:12:46.659
Now, when exactly did the
American South become a slave

00:12:46.659 --> 00:12:49.816
society?
Is it 1820--the Missouri

00:12:49.816 --> 00:12:54.860
Crisis--in that settlement,
and at least the beginnings now

00:12:54.860 --> 00:13:00.030
of a clarity of its expansion?
Or was it more the 1830s when

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:04.868
you've got this booming cotton
production happening finally in

00:13:04.868 --> 00:13:08.120
Alabama and Mississippi and
Louisiana?

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.069
Or was it 1840?
Or was it really in the wake of

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:15.514
the Mexican War when you get
this massive expansion into the

00:13:15.514 --> 00:13:18.958
great southwest and the Mexican
Session--which we'll take up

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:22.424
actually next week?
That's always open to debate,

00:13:22.424 --> 00:13:25.769
exactly when the South became a
slave society.

00:13:25.769 --> 00:13:29.341
But I think it became,
in most ways and in most

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:33.533
definitions, a slave society
surely by the 1820s or the

00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:37.065
1830s.
Now, one aspect of that slave

00:13:37.065 --> 00:13:42.669
society then--and I'll focus on
it just at least briefly--is

00:13:42.669 --> 00:13:48.179
that as Americans ended the
foreign slave trade--and we did

00:13:48.179 --> 00:13:52.785
in 1808--this is,
this month is the bi-centennial

00:13:52.785 --> 00:13:56.030
of the legal end of
America's--the United

00:13:56.030 --> 00:14:00.250
State'--participation in the
foreign slave trade.

00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:03.691
Now it didn't entirely end,
and there were some South

00:14:03.691 --> 00:14:07.200
Carolinians and Georgians who
wanted to re-open it,

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.693
and a few folks out in
Louisiana, who wanted to re-open

00:14:09.693 --> 00:14:11.910
it at numerous times in the
antebellum period,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:18.112
especially in the late 1850s.
They were the same people who

00:14:18.112 --> 00:14:21.620
were always trying to annex
Cuba;

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.878
about four times over they
tried to annex Cuba,

00:14:22.878 --> 00:14:24.409
and it's still a bit of mystery
how it never happened.

00:14:24.409 --> 00:14:27.975
But as the foreign slave trade
was closed off,

00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:32.331
for a whole variety of reasons,
only one of which was that

00:14:32.331 --> 00:14:34.808
there was this passage,
sort of a vow,

00:14:34.808 --> 00:14:38.424
in the original Constitution
that the question would be

00:14:38.424 --> 00:14:43.299
re-visited in 20 years,
and 1808 was 20 years.

00:14:43.299 --> 00:14:47.710
But as the foreign slave trade
was cut off the domestic

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:51.059
American slave trade absolutely
boomed.

00:14:51.059 --> 00:14:54.949
And one of the reasons that the
American South could become such

00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:58.776
a profitable slave society,
one of the reasons that the

00:14:58.776 --> 00:15:03.075
cotton boom could be the cotton
boom is because one of the

00:15:03.075 --> 00:15:06.470
unique features of North
American slavery,

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.218
U.S.
slavery, is or was,

00:15:08.218 --> 00:15:12.322
that it was the only slave
population in the entire New

00:15:12.322 --> 00:15:16.579
World--Brazil managed it now and
then but not in the long

00:15:16.579 --> 00:15:20.987
run--it's the only slave society
in the New World where the

00:15:20.987 --> 00:15:24.559
slaves naturally reproduced
themselves.

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:28.176
And it has to do with climate,
it has to do with sex

00:15:28.176 --> 00:15:31.367
ratio--male to female--it has to
do with diet,

00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:33.850
and it has to do with movement.

00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:39.456
If Frederick Jackson Turner had
anything right in "The Frontier

00:15:39.456 --> 00:15:41.847
Thesis," although he didn't pay
hardly any attention to the

00:15:41.847 --> 00:15:44.736
South,
this idea of a safety valve of

00:15:44.736 --> 00:15:48.700
a West to move to was surely
there for slavery.

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:55.948
Between 1810 and 1820
alone--this is the decade of the

00:15:55.948 --> 00:16:00.399
War of 1812, which caused all
kinds of chaos on the Western

00:16:00.399 --> 00:16:04.774
frontier--137,000 American
slaves were forced to move from

00:16:04.774 --> 00:16:09.149
North Carolina or the Chesapeake
states to Alabama,

00:16:09.149 --> 00:16:12.220
Mississippi,
and other western regions.

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:15.240
That's in the one decade of the
teens.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:19.661
Then from 1820 to 1860,
the forty years before the war,

00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:23.918
an estimated roughly two
million American slaves were

00:16:23.918 --> 00:16:28.666
sold to satisfy the need of
slave labor in the great cotton

00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:31.860
kingdom of the growing
Southwest.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:40.819
Now, about roughly two-thirds
of those two million slaves

00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:47.070
moved from the Eastern seaboard
or the Upper South to Alabama,

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:49.218
Louisiana, Mississippi,
Texas, Arkansas,

00:16:49.218 --> 00:16:53.146
et cetera.
About two-thirds of those went

00:16:53.146 --> 00:16:57.719
by outright sale,
by financial speculation,

00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:04.252
in now a growing huge American
business of the domestic slave

00:17:04.252 --> 00:17:06.634
trade.
By the 1830s,

00:17:06.634 --> 00:17:10.641
1840s, there were over 100 men
in Charleston,

00:17:10.641 --> 00:17:15.286
South Carolina alone,
making their livings full-time

00:17:15.286 --> 00:17:18.935
as slave traders.
Their ads were in the

00:17:18.935 --> 00:17:22.604
newspapers every day.
Many of them owned their own

00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:26.355
shops and their own--in
effect--jails where they housed

00:17:26.355 --> 00:17:29.825
people.
Other cities became major ports

00:17:29.825 --> 00:17:34.839
or places of deportation,
for the domestic slave trade.

00:17:34.839 --> 00:17:37.555
Richmond, Virginia,
for example,

00:17:37.555 --> 00:17:42.809
became a huge slave-trading
center by the 1840s and 1850s.

00:17:42.809 --> 00:17:47.627
It had two--depending on when
you look--to three dozen major

00:17:47.627 --> 00:17:51.815
full-time slave traders.
One of the richest was a man

00:17:51.815 --> 00:17:55.269
named Hector Davis.
Hector Davis owned a two-story

00:17:55.269 --> 00:17:59.359
slave auction house and jail on
14^(th) and Franklin Streets,

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:02.973
just two blocks down the hill
from Thomas Jefferson's glorious

00:18:02.973 --> 00:18:05.579
capitol building of the State of
Virginia.

00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:08.349
Just two blocks down the hill
from that great equestrian

00:18:08.349 --> 00:18:10.818
statue of George Washington,
the Founder,

00:18:10.818 --> 00:18:15.289
you could find a huge slave
jail owned by Hector Davis.

00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:19.523
Hector Davis kept tremendous
records, he kept account books,

00:18:19.523 --> 00:18:22.568
huge account books.
And one of those account books

00:18:22.568 --> 00:18:25.184
ended up in the Chicago
Historical Society after the

00:18:25.184 --> 00:18:27.748
Civil War because it was
confiscated by an Illinois

00:18:27.748 --> 00:18:31.228
regiment that took it home.
And I worked with that account

00:18:31.228 --> 00:18:34.906
book, because one of the two
slaves I write about in this new

00:18:34.906 --> 00:18:38.216
book called A Slave No
More--I publish their two

00:18:38.216 --> 00:18:41.710
narratives--was indeed a young
14-year-old teenager,

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:44.688
sold out of North
Carolina--from Snow Hill,

00:18:44.688 --> 00:18:47.809
North Carolina,
he was sold in 1860 to Hector

00:18:47.809 --> 00:18:51.539
Davis in Richmond.
Hector Davis purchased him for

00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:53.681
$900.00.
For about six months Wallace

00:18:53.681 --> 00:18:56.825
Turnage worked in Hector Davis's
slave auction house helping

00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:59.377
organize the auctions every day.
And one day,

00:18:59.377 --> 00:19:01.039
Wallace was told,
"Today, boy,

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:04.284
you're in the auction."
And he was sold for $1000.00 to

00:19:04.284 --> 00:19:07.737
an Alabama cotton planter who
came up to Richmond twice a year

00:19:07.737 --> 00:19:10.493
to buy slaves.
And 72 hours by train he found

00:19:10.493 --> 00:19:13.839
himself on a huge cotton
plantation, near Pickensville,

00:19:13.839 --> 00:19:17.171
Alabama, on the--in west
central Alabama,

00:19:17.171 --> 00:19:20.920
on the Mississippi border,
at 14-years-old.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.529
More on Wallace Turnage later
in the course.

00:19:26.529 --> 00:19:30.350
He'll be sold again,
by the way, a third time,

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.067
for $2000.00,
in Mobile, Alabama,

00:19:33.067 --> 00:19:37.528
at the Mobile Slave Jail.
I calculated in Hector Davis's

00:19:37.528 --> 00:19:41.592
account book that the biggest
week he had--and he had some big

00:19:41.592 --> 00:19:45.390
weeks--but he had a week in 1859
where he made a cool,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.264
approximately,
$120,000.00 in profit,

00:19:49.264 --> 00:19:54.089
just from selling slaves.
I mean, the equivalent of a

00:19:54.089 --> 00:19:57.786
healthy teenage male slave,
if you could sell him for

00:19:57.786 --> 00:20:01.981
$1000.00 in 1860--it's about the
same price of a good Toyota

00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:03.190
Camry today.

00:20:08.339 --> 00:20:11.987
And when I go to the A-1 Toyota
for my service or to buy my new

00:20:11.987 --> 00:20:15.223
Camry, which I've done every
four years for the last two

00:20:15.223 --> 00:20:18.020
decades,
I don't always think of a slave

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:20.650
market but it does occur to me
that--.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.782
[laughter]
They just sell those Toyotas,

00:20:23.782 --> 00:20:26.352
they tell you,
"Here's the price,

00:20:26.352 --> 00:20:28.120
we don't bargain."

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.819
The South was part of the
westward movement.

00:20:38.819 --> 00:20:42.500
For slave children--one other
little point about this,

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.596
so we can get a sense of this
system that is now about to be

00:20:46.596 --> 00:20:49.859
justified and defended--for
slave children,

00:20:49.859 --> 00:20:54.148
between 1820 and 1860,
living in the Upper South or

00:20:54.148 --> 00:20:58.608
the Eastern Seaboard,
they had approximately a thirty

00:20:58.608 --> 00:21:03.754
percent chance of being sold
outright away from their parents

00:21:03.754 --> 00:21:06.070
before they were ten.

00:21:09.869 --> 00:21:14.459
Now, just to give you a sense
of how cold and calculated this

00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:17.748
business was,
and how in many ways the first

00:21:17.748 --> 00:21:21.650
defense or justification of
slavery in America is of

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:26.392
course--it certainly is by the
late Antebellum Period--it is an

00:21:26.392 --> 00:21:29.800
unabashed economic defense,
as we'll see.

00:21:33.509 --> 00:21:36.651
Ads in newspapers,
like this one in Charleston,

00:21:36.651 --> 00:21:41.281
would read, "Negroes wanted.
I am paying the highest cash

00:21:41.281 --> 00:21:46.720
prices for young and likely
Negroes, those having good front

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.039
teeth and being otherwise
sound."

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:55.432
It's all about market forces
and the health and the condition

00:21:55.432 --> 00:21:58.157
of your product.
Probably the best book written

00:21:58.157 --> 00:22:00.297
on this, particularly on the
language of the domestic slave

00:22:00.297 --> 00:22:02.663
trade,
is Walter Johnson's book called

00:22:02.663 --> 00:22:05.944
Soul by Soul,
a book--I highly recommend you

00:22:05.944 --> 00:22:08.700
read it sometime in your reading
lives.

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:12.381
But it's amazing to read the
letters and the language of

00:22:12.381 --> 00:22:15.460
slave traders when they write to
each other,

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.989
the complacency,
the mixture of just pure racism

00:22:19.989 --> 00:22:25.579
on the one hand and just
business language on the other.

00:22:25.579 --> 00:22:30.844
"I refused a girl 20-years-old
at $700.00 yesterday," one

00:22:30.844 --> 00:22:35.982
trader wrote to another in 1853.
"If you think best to take her

00:22:35.982 --> 00:22:39.606
at 700, I can still get her.
She is very badly whipped but

00:22:39.606 --> 00:22:40.630
has good teeth."

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:47.492
"Bought a cook yesterday,"
wrote another trader,

00:22:47.492 --> 00:22:51.700
"Bought a cook yesterday that
was to go out of the state.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:56.849
She just made the people mad,
that was all."

00:22:56.849 --> 00:23:01.639
"I have bought a boy named
Isaac," wrote another trader,

00:23:01.639 --> 00:23:05.852
"for $1100.00."
He writes this in 1854 to his

00:23:05.852 --> 00:23:08.810
partner.
"Bought a boy named Isaac.

00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:13.946
I think him very prime.
He is a house-servant,

00:23:13.946 --> 00:23:17.720
first-rate cook,
and splendid carriage driver.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:22.527
He is also a fine painter and
varnisher, and says he can make

00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:27.515
a fine panel door.
Also, he performs well on the

00:23:27.515 --> 00:23:30.259
violin.
He is a genius.

00:23:30.259 --> 00:23:33.736
And strange to say,
I think he's smarter than I

00:23:33.736 --> 00:23:34.190
am."

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:48.507
Truth always creeps through all
of our language--it doesn't

00:23:48.507 --> 00:23:53.455
always but sometimes--creeps
through our language,

00:23:53.455 --> 00:23:58.170
doesn't it?
Now, how is slavery defended?

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:09.177
In many ways, to say the least.
But I want to give you at least

00:24:09.177 --> 00:24:13.759
some sense of the development of
the pro-slavery argument,

00:24:13.759 --> 00:24:17.830
the kinds of arguments that
were used, how they changed over

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:19.970
time, who made the arguments.

00:24:23.119 --> 00:24:27.548
Now, the best way to begin to
understand pro-slavery ideology,

00:24:27.548 --> 00:24:31.468
whether we're in the early
period of its defense in the

00:24:31.468 --> 00:24:34.847
1820s--actually,
a quite virulent defense of

00:24:34.847 --> 00:24:38.345
slavery begins early,
it isn't something that just

00:24:38.345 --> 00:24:43.200
sprung from Southern pens in the
1850s during all this expansion,

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:47.124
it comes very early.
But a framework in which to

00:24:47.124 --> 00:24:51.340
understand it is that
pro-slavery ideology was,

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.281
at its heart,
a kind of deeply conservative,

00:24:55.281 --> 00:24:59.980
organic worldview.
And by that I mean a Burkean

00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:03.957
conservatism,
a set of beliefs that says the

00:25:03.957 --> 00:25:08.163
world is ordered as it is,
for reasons,

00:25:08.163 --> 00:25:15.019
and that human beings ought not
tinker with that order,

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:19.709
very much.
It was a set of beliefs in the

00:25:19.709 --> 00:25:23.660
sustenance of a social order as
it is.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:28.991
It was a belief in a
hierarchical conception of not

00:25:28.991 --> 00:25:32.190
only society,
but of people.

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:37.985
That people were conceived,
whether by nature or by God or

00:25:37.985 --> 00:25:43.069
even by evolution,
with a certain order to them;

00:25:43.069 --> 00:25:47.546
some born to do this and some
born to do that and some born to

00:25:47.546 --> 00:25:50.172
do that.
It's an organic conception of

00:25:50.172 --> 00:25:54.270
the world.
It just is the way it is.

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:58.450
It's natural.
Remember back to Alexander H.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:03.772
Steven's cornerstone quote --
he uses the word "natural" twice

00:26:03.772 --> 00:26:06.853
in that passage.
This worldview had,

00:26:06.853 --> 00:26:09.849
of course, an obsession with
stability.

00:26:09.849 --> 00:26:13.790
It's one of the reasons white
Southerners didn't like

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:15.637
reformers.
It's one of the reasons

00:26:15.637 --> 00:26:17.994
Abolitionists are dangerous.
What are Abolitionists calling

00:26:17.994 --> 00:26:22.460
for?
Upsetting the social order.

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:26.552
They're offering a critique of
the social order,

00:26:26.552 --> 00:26:31.950
and they even have the audacity
to talk about good and evil.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:36.793
It's a worldview often
obsessed, as we said last time,

00:26:36.793 --> 00:26:42.303
with notions of honor and duty.
And it's a worldview deeply

00:26:42.303 --> 00:26:46.460
rooted in the idea or respect
for tradition;

00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:52.726
tradition and social control.
In this worldview,

00:26:52.726 --> 00:26:56.341
institutions--human
institutions--evolve only slowly

00:26:56.341 --> 00:27:00.950
over time and cannot be altered
by abrupt human interventions.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:05.798
It's dangerous to abruptly
intervene in the evolution of

00:27:05.798 --> 00:27:10.451
human institutions.
Now, think what's at stake here

00:27:10.451 --> 00:27:14.518
in this worldview,
especially as we transition

00:27:14.518 --> 00:27:18.857
next Thursday to a
developing--though by no means

00:27:18.857 --> 00:27:22.652
unanimous or
homogenous--northern worldview

00:27:22.652 --> 00:27:26.720
in which reform impulses get
embedded.

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:34.241
White Southern defenders of
slavery were--to some

00:27:34.241 --> 00:27:38.349
extent--like other
Americans--products of the

00:27:38.349 --> 00:27:42.482
Enlightenment.
Some of them come to really

00:27:42.482 --> 00:27:46.527
believe in intellect.
They really do come to believe

00:27:46.527 --> 00:27:50.077
in the power of reason,
of human beings to figure out

00:27:50.077 --> 00:27:53.051
the universe.
But to figure it out in

00:27:53.051 --> 00:27:56.422
different ways.
You can be a product of the

00:27:56.422 --> 00:28:00.089
Enlightenment and still be
deeply conservative.

00:28:00.089 --> 00:28:03.046
You can be a product of the
Enlightenment,

00:28:03.046 --> 00:28:06.795
with a faith in reason,
and not become a Romantic who

00:28:06.795 --> 00:28:10.400
begins to believe in the
possibilities of man,

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.660
or even the perfectibility of
man.

00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:21.045
Conservativism--deep organic
forms of Conservativism--is not

00:28:21.045 --> 00:28:24.616
antithetical to the
Enlightenment,

00:28:24.616 --> 00:28:30.076
at least not entirely.
Although pro-slavery writers

00:28:30.076 --> 00:28:35.843
will become deeply contemptuous
of Natural Law--of Natural Law

00:28:35.843 --> 00:28:41.610
doctrine as it can be applied to
the possibilities of man.

00:28:44.769 --> 00:28:48.322
Many of them will argue,
therefore, that ideas like

00:28:48.322 --> 00:28:50.880
freedom--and that idea of
liberty,

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.097
so much at stake in the age of
the American Revolution and

00:28:54.097 --> 00:28:57.555
falling off everybody's tongue,
and eventually falling off

00:28:57.555 --> 00:29:01.360
their tongues and off their pens
as well, what they're fighting

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.569
for by 1861 were their
liberties,

00:29:03.569 --> 00:29:06.849
they said, over and over and
over and over again.

00:29:06.849 --> 00:29:10.823
But in their worldview,
the pro-slavery worldview,

00:29:10.823 --> 00:29:15.769
ideas like freedom and liberty
were simply never absolutes,

00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:19.224
and many of them will directly
reverse Thomas Jefferson's

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:22.000
Declaration of Independence and
simply say,

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.730
"Nobody is born equal."

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.862
They will argue over and over
and over again--some of them

00:29:31.862 --> 00:29:35.648
almost in a feudalistic
way--that freedom must always be

00:29:35.648 --> 00:29:40.403
balanced with order,
and that order is rooted in

00:29:40.403 --> 00:29:45.461
certain kinds of prescribed
stations in life,

00:29:45.461 --> 00:29:49.830
for the various statuses of
humans.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.458
Or freedom, they will argue,
must be balanced with

00:29:57.458 --> 00:30:00.746
tradition.
The possibilities of freedom

00:30:00.746 --> 00:30:05.120
must always, in their view,
be balanced with the world as

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.264
it as--not as it ought to be.
They are, therefore,

00:30:09.264 --> 00:30:14.034
going to have an extremely
different point of view--from at

00:30:14.034 --> 00:30:18.228
least Abolitionists in the
North--on this concept of

00:30:18.228 --> 00:30:21.301
equality.
Although a lot of Abolitionists

00:30:21.301 --> 00:30:23.720
had their struggles with this
one too.

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:29.053
Southern pro-slavery defenders
are much more likely to stress a

00:30:29.053 --> 00:30:32.665
human's duty,
than they're ever to stress a

00:30:32.665 --> 00:30:34.300
human's rights.

00:30:37.349 --> 00:30:41.506
They believed the world was
made up of a struggle between

00:30:41.506 --> 00:30:44.029
human autonomy,
on the one hand,

00:30:44.029 --> 00:30:48.017
and human dependency on the
other, and you should never give

00:30:48.017 --> 00:30:49.640
up on that dependency.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:56.956
As early as 1826 an important
pro-slavery writer named Edward

00:30:56.956 --> 00:31:00.549
Brown argued that "Slavery,"
he said, quote:

00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:06.305
"had ever been the stepping
ladder by which nations have

00:31:06.305 --> 00:31:10.700
passed from barbarism to
civilization."

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.473
There you have the roots and
the kernel of the so-called

00:31:14.473 --> 00:31:17.150
"positive good thesis" about
slavery.

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:21.056
That slavery was a way in which
you sustained a social order,

00:31:21.056 --> 00:31:23.529
a way in which you built an
economy,

00:31:23.529 --> 00:31:29.685
a way in which you maximized
the possibilities of those who

00:31:29.685 --> 00:31:36.690
deserved it, by using those who
did not deserve the same fruits.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:46.745
Pro-slavery writers,
you have to understand,

00:31:46.745 --> 00:31:50.155
had also a really often a
fundamentally different

00:31:50.155 --> 00:31:55.298
conception of history itself,
or of how history happens,

00:31:55.298 --> 00:32:00.250
than will many eventually
northern anti-slavery

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.547
writers--even,
eventually, the political

00:32:04.547 --> 00:32:08.692
anti-slavery folks like an
Abraham Lincoln,

00:32:08.692 --> 00:32:13.527
who was never a real
abolitionist but did at least

00:32:13.527 --> 00:32:17.869
grow up with anti-slavery in his
heart.

00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:20.481
Thomas R.
Dew, a very important

00:32:20.481 --> 00:32:24.660
pro-slavery writer,
who wrote a whole book in the

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.796
wake of the state of Virginia's
debates in 1831 and '32 over

00:32:29.796 --> 00:32:33.539
whether to re-write its
Constitution.

00:32:33.539 --> 00:32:38.440
And they squarely faced the
question of a gradual abolition

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:42.579
plan for the state of Virginia
in 1831 and '32.

00:32:42.579 --> 00:32:44.858
They had been planning to
rewrite their Constitution--an

00:32:44.858 --> 00:32:46.930
extraordinary turning point in
Southern history.

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.446
The problem was,
of course, Nat Turner's

00:32:48.446 --> 00:32:51.340
Insurrection;
it had just occurred in October

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:55.440
of 1831 and they held these
debates in the wake of it.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.894
And Dew wrote a forceful
defense of slavery in the wake

00:32:58.894 --> 00:33:02.604
of this, which became kind of a
seminal text for all future

00:33:02.604 --> 00:33:06.147
pro-slavery writers.
Among the many things he said,

00:33:06.147 --> 00:33:09.759
and that was the simple sense
of how history happens.

00:33:09.759 --> 00:33:14.287
"There is a time for all
things," wrote Dew,

00:33:14.287 --> 00:33:20.710
"and nothing in this world
should be done before its time."

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.820
Now, what would you do if your
parents told you that?

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:27.925
They probably have.
What would you do if your

00:33:27.925 --> 00:33:29.650
professors told you that all the
time?

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:34.594
"Stop trying to change things.
Nothing will change before its

00:33:34.594 --> 00:33:35.060
time."

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:42.630
You'd probably get bored,
or angry.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:45.590
Or who knows?
Maybe you would just agree.

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:48.753
I don't know.
Youth are supposed to be

00:33:48.753 --> 00:33:49.530
impatient.

00:33:54.990 --> 00:34:02.559
Now, there are many ways to
look at pro-slavery.

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:07.083
Deep, deep in the pro-slavery
argument--I'm going to give you

00:34:07.083 --> 00:34:11.606
categories here to hang your
hats on--deep in the pro-slavery

00:34:11.606 --> 00:34:15.902
argument is a biblical argument.
Almost all pro-slavery writers

00:34:15.902 --> 00:34:18.909
at one point or another will dip
into the Old Testament,

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:22.946
or dip into the New
Testament--they especially would

00:34:22.946 --> 00:34:27.062
dip to the Old--to show how
slavery is an ancient and

00:34:27.062 --> 00:34:31.074
venerable institution.
Its venerability was its own

00:34:31.074 --> 00:34:33.430
argument, some said.
It's always been around.

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:38.613
Every civilization has had it.
All those biblical societies

00:34:38.613 --> 00:34:40.960
had it.
You can read Jeremiah and

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.691
Isaiah and some of the great Old
Testament prophets in some ways

00:34:44.691 --> 00:34:50.236
as defenders of slavery.
You can therefore assume it was

00:34:50.236 --> 00:34:55.829
divinely sanctioned.
You can also look in the New

00:34:55.829 --> 00:35:01.250
Testament for examples of it,
justifications of it.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:04.554
"Slaves, be honorable,
be dutiful"--be obedient is

00:35:04.554 --> 00:35:07.454
usually the word in the King
James--"Slaves,

00:35:07.454 --> 00:35:11.825
be obedient to your masters."
Slavery is all over the Bible,

00:35:11.825 --> 00:35:14.953
in one way or another.
The Bible, of course,

00:35:14.953 --> 00:35:19.119
can breathe anti-slavery into a
situation and it can breathe

00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:22.857
pro-slavery into a situation.
A second kind of set of

00:35:22.857 --> 00:35:26.840
arguments, I've already referred
to, are the historical ones.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.386
Here it is not just the
venerability of slavery,

00:35:31.386 --> 00:35:35.545
how old it is,
but it's the idea that it has

00:35:35.545 --> 00:35:41.639
been crucial to the development
of all great civilizations.

00:35:41.639 --> 00:35:46.431
That slavery may have its bad
aspects but it has been the

00:35:46.431 --> 00:35:49.853
engine of good,
it has been the engine of

00:35:49.853 --> 00:35:52.331
empires,
the engine of wealth,

00:35:52.331 --> 00:35:55.929
the engine of greatness.
How would you have had Cicero?

00:35:55.929 --> 00:36:00.956
How would you have had the
great Roman philosophers and

00:36:00.956 --> 00:36:04.017
thinkers?
How would you have had the

00:36:04.017 --> 00:36:07.230
great Greek playwrights,
they would argue,

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:11.070
without the system,
the world the Greeks were able

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:15.286
to create with the Helots?
That at the base of all

00:36:15.286 --> 00:36:19.714
societies there has to be a
labor system that will support

00:36:19.714 --> 00:36:21.890
the possibility of Plato.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:30.766
Pro-slavery ideology is also
part of--at the same time it's

00:36:30.766 --> 00:36:34.784
resistant to--the greatest
product arguably of the

00:36:34.784 --> 00:36:38.437
Enlightenment,
and that is the idea of natural

00:36:38.437 --> 00:36:40.623
rights;
natural law,

00:36:40.623 --> 00:36:44.818
natural rights,
rights by birth,

00:36:44.818 --> 00:36:50.095
rights from God,
being born with certain

00:36:50.095 --> 00:36:54.815
capacities.
Now pro-slavery writers were

00:36:54.815 --> 00:37:00.292
inspired by this to some extent,
but many of them will simply

00:37:00.292 --> 00:37:04.017
convert it.
They will convert it--they'll

00:37:04.017 --> 00:37:08.576
take portions of John Locke that
they like, and not the

00:37:08.576 --> 00:37:13.978
others--and they'll say the real
rule of the world is not natural

00:37:13.978 --> 00:37:16.670
equality,
but it is natural inequality.

00:37:19.849 --> 00:37:24.572
Humans are not all born the
same, with the same capacities,

00:37:24.572 --> 00:37:25.550
abilities.

00:37:30.449 --> 00:37:37.518
Now, then there's a whole array
of economic arguments,

00:37:37.518 --> 00:37:43.119
and the cynic,
the economic determinist,

00:37:43.119 --> 00:37:47.315
simply goes to the economic
conclusions of pro-slavery and

00:37:47.315 --> 00:37:48.420
nowhere else.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:57.180
One of the greatest of these
writers was James Henry Hammond,

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:01.644
a South Carolina planter who
had plenty of mixed-race

00:38:01.644 --> 00:38:04.846
children.
He was in some ways the epitome

00:38:04.846 --> 00:38:07.269
of the kind of cynical
pro-slavery.

00:38:07.269 --> 00:38:11.659
In the end of the day,
he wasn't bothered by morality.

00:38:11.659 --> 00:38:16.860
His argument for slavery was
that ultimately it was amoral.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:21.500
But at the end of the day,
he also essentially made a

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:26.230
property argument or a property
defense of slavery.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:29.217
He wrote, among other things,
"The means therefore,

00:38:29.217 --> 00:38:32.638
whatever they may have been,
by which the African race,

00:38:32.638 --> 00:38:35.769
now in this county,
have been reduced to slavery,

00:38:35.769 --> 00:38:40.083
cannot affect us since they are
our property,

00:38:40.083 --> 00:38:46.088
as your land is your property,
by inheritance or purchase and

00:38:46.088 --> 00:38:50.290
prescriptive right.
You will say that man cannot

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:54.263
hold property in man.
The answer is that he can,

00:38:54.263 --> 00:38:58.108
and actually does,
hold property in his fellow,

00:38:58.108 --> 00:39:01.535
all over the world,
in a variety of forms,

00:39:01.535 --> 00:39:05.469
and has always done so."
Thank you very much,

00:39:05.469 --> 00:39:09.244
said Henry Hammond,
don't talk to me about property

00:39:09.244 --> 00:39:10.000
in man.

00:39:13.630 --> 00:39:19.110
Oh, some would get guilty.
Indeed they did.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:22.944
Some would get worried and they
would discuss slavery as a

00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:26.239
necessary evil--this system
entailed upon them.

00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:28.059
God, they wished they were
without it.

00:39:28.059 --> 00:39:30.204
And some of them,
frankly folks,

00:39:30.204 --> 00:39:34.251
were deeply sincere in that.
One of the most famous and one

00:39:34.251 --> 00:39:38.261
of the most prolific was a man
named Charles Colcott Jones who

00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:41.876
owned a huge rice and partly
cotton plantation system in

00:39:41.876 --> 00:39:45.949
low-country Georgia,
just south of Savannah.

00:39:45.949 --> 00:39:50.146
He and his family wrote
literally thousands upon

00:39:50.146 --> 00:39:53.803
thousands of letters.
those family letters have been

00:39:53.803 --> 00:39:56.849
published in a book called
The Children of Pride,

00:39:56.849 --> 00:39:59.933
and a brilliant book has been
written about Colcott Jones and

00:39:59.933 --> 00:40:02.760
his extended family by Erskine
Clarke called Dwelling

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.501
Place.
But one of the fascinating

00:40:04.501 --> 00:40:06.505
things about Charles Colcott
Jones--born in the late

00:40:06.505 --> 00:40:09.543
eighteenth century,
rises to adulthood by the

00:40:09.543 --> 00:40:14.671
teens, 1820s--is he's a classic
example of a highly educated

00:40:14.671 --> 00:40:17.750
Southern planter.
He came North.

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:21.000
He was educated in Theology at
Yale for awhile.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.040
He was really affected by it.
And then he went up to Andover

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.578
Theological Academy and he
taught there and he was affected

00:40:28.578 --> 00:40:31.079
even more, by New England
theologians.

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:35.037
And he began to write back,
first to his fiancée who

00:40:35.037 --> 00:40:38.790
quickly became his wife,
Mary, and he was really worried

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:42.187
about all the slaves he owned.
And he writes,

00:40:42.187 --> 00:40:44.882
for example,
to Mary: "I am moreover

00:40:44.882 --> 00:40:49.270
undecided whether I ought to
continue to hold slaves."

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:53.091
He underlines hold slaves.
"As to the principle of slavery

00:40:53.091 --> 00:40:54.919
it is wrong.
It is unjust,

00:40:54.919 --> 00:40:58.639
contrary to nature and
religion, to hold men enslaved.

00:40:58.639 --> 00:41:01.519
But the question is,
in my present circumstances,

00:41:01.519 --> 00:41:04.460
with evil on my hands,
entailed from my father,

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:08.171
would the general interest of
the slaves and community at

00:41:08.171 --> 00:41:10.690
large, with reference to the
slaves,

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.949
be promoted best by
emancipation?

00:41:14.949 --> 00:41:19.766
Could I do more for the
ultimate good of the slave

00:41:19.766 --> 00:41:24.780
population by holding or
emancipating what I own?

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:31.320
I know not very particularly
how you feel on this point."

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.889
And there are many letters like
that.

00:41:32.889 --> 00:41:37.300
He and his wife Mary write back
and forth about how evil slavery

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:40.197
is.
But in the end Colcott Jones

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:46.110
becomes a classic example of the
guilty pro-slavery slaveholder.

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:49.030
He doesn't know how to free
them.

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:53.409
He doesn't know how to go to
emancipation.

00:41:53.409 --> 00:41:59.458
Instead he develops a highly
intricate theory of how he's

00:41:59.458 --> 00:42:04.210
going to use slavery to save
black people.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:07.576
He's going to ameliorate their
conditions, he's going to make

00:42:07.576 --> 00:42:10.269
their slavery on his plantations
so effective,

00:42:10.269 --> 00:42:14.437
so good, such a even joyous
form of labor,

00:42:14.437 --> 00:42:20.130
that he will be doing God's
work by improving slavery.

00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:29.469
It's a genuinely tragic sort of
story in his case.

00:42:29.469 --> 00:42:32.776
There are plenty of pro-slavery
writers who also,

00:42:32.776 --> 00:42:35.875
to some extent,
whether out of guilt or out of

00:42:35.875 --> 00:42:38.880
awareness,
saw slavery as wrong,

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:44.515
but they saw it as a problem
more for white people than for

00:42:44.515 --> 00:42:48.201
black people.
Their concern was not the

00:42:48.201 --> 00:42:52.719
conditions of blacks but what
slavery did to whites;

00:42:52.719 --> 00:42:57.393
and usually they ended up in
the same situation as Colcott

00:42:57.393 --> 00:43:00.388
Jones.
There are many pro-slavery

00:43:00.388 --> 00:43:04.614
writers who developed,
like James Henry Hammond,

00:43:04.614 --> 00:43:09.830
what I would call the cynical
or amoral form of pro-slavery

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:12.616
argument;
and this is a potent form of

00:43:12.616 --> 00:43:14.470
argument when you think about
it.

00:43:19.489 --> 00:43:24.535
One of them was a writer named
William Harper who wrote a book

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:28.340
called Memoir Slavery in
1837 or '38.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.650
It's an oft quoted work of
pro-slavery writing.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:37.425
This is just one little passage.
This is this kind of cynical,

00:43:37.425 --> 00:43:40.720
if you want,
defense of slavery.

00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:47.924
It is what it is, deal with it.
He wrote, "Man is born to

00:43:47.924 --> 00:43:51.388
subjection.
The condition of our whole

00:43:51.388 --> 00:43:55.440
existence is but to struggle
with evil, to compare them,

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.173
to choose between them,
evils that is,

00:43:59.173 --> 00:44:03.210
and so far as we can to
mitigate them.

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:09.016
To say that there is evil in
any institution is only to say

00:44:09.016 --> 00:44:13.900
that it is a human institution."
And Harper's writing in the

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:17.356
thir--James Henry Hammond starts
writing in the forties and into

00:44:17.356 --> 00:44:19.769
the fifties and he takes it much
further,

00:44:19.769 --> 00:44:22.615
and he writes over and over and
over again that,

00:44:22.615 --> 00:44:25.340
"The only problem with slavery
in America,"

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.660
said James Henry Hammond,
is that too damn many

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.736
northerners didn't understand it
is the way of the world as it

00:44:30.736 --> 00:44:32.659
is,
and they ought to stop talking

00:44:32.659 --> 00:44:34.489
about the world as it ought to
be.

00:44:34.489 --> 00:44:38.801
And Hammond even aggressively,
directly, took on Thomas

00:44:38.801 --> 00:44:42.010
Jefferson.
I'm sorry, Harper did,

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.558
even before him.
Here's Harper on Jefferson:

00:44:45.558 --> 00:44:49.577
"It is not the first time that
I have had occasion to observe

00:44:49.577 --> 00:44:53.529
that men may repeat with the
utmost confidence some maxim or

00:44:53.529 --> 00:44:56.543
sentimental phrase as
'self-evident' or

00:44:56.543 --> 00:45:00.728
'admitted truth',
which is either palpably false

00:45:00.728 --> 00:45:05.014
or to which upon examination it
will be found that they attach

00:45:05.014 --> 00:45:08.233
no definite idea.
Notwithstanding our respect for

00:45:08.233 --> 00:45:11.510
the important document which
declared our independence,

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.763
yet if anything be found in it,
and especially in what may be

00:45:15.763 --> 00:45:19.519
regarded rather as its ornament
than its substance,

00:45:19.519 --> 00:45:24.010
false, sophistical and
unmeaning, that respect should

00:45:24.010 --> 00:45:27.809
not screen it from the freest
examination.

00:45:27.809 --> 00:45:34.195
All men are born free and
equal?"--he says with a question

00:45:34.195 --> 00:45:37.568
mark.
"Is it not palpably nearer the

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:42.573
truth to say that no man was
ever born free and that no two

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:47.305
men were ever born equal?
Man is born in a state of the

00:45:47.305 --> 00:45:50.740
most helpless dependence on
other people."

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.360
And then there's the whole vast
category of racial defense and

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.160
justification of slavery.
At the end of the day that's

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.206
where Alexander H.
Stephens went,

00:46:06.206 --> 00:46:08.699
with his Cornerstone Speech in
1861.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:12.568
That's where all of them went
at one point or another,

00:46:12.568 --> 00:46:16.059
some less than others.
Probably the most prominent

00:46:16.059 --> 00:46:19.603
pro-slavery writer to make the
racial case--and they all

00:46:19.603 --> 00:46:23.469
did--but probably the most
prominent was George Fitzhugh.

00:46:23.469 --> 00:46:25.862
In a book called Sociology
of the South--he's also the

00:46:25.862 --> 00:46:28.096
same George Fitzhugh who wrote a
book called Cannibals

00:46:28.096 --> 00:46:30.090
All--but in Sociology of
the South,

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:36.350
his famous pro-slavery tract in
1854, he wrote this:

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:42.242
"The Negro," he said,
"is but a grownup child and

00:46:42.242 --> 00:46:48.955
must be governed as a child.
The master occupies toward him

00:46:48.955 --> 00:46:54.777
the place of parent or guardian.
Like a wild horse he must be

00:46:54.777 --> 00:46:59.786
caught, tamed and domesticated.
We find slavery repeatedly

00:46:59.786 --> 00:47:03.929
instituted by God or by men
acting under his immediate care

00:47:03.929 --> 00:47:07.142
and direction,
as in the instance of Moses and

00:47:07.142 --> 00:47:10.142
Joshua.
Nowhere in the Old or New

00:47:10.142 --> 00:47:14.084
Testament do we find the
institution condemned,

00:47:14.084 --> 00:47:17.769
but frequently recognized and
enforced."

00:47:17.769 --> 00:47:22.262
And probably his most famous
line, "Men are not born entitled

00:47:22.262 --> 00:47:25.862
to equal rights.
It would be far nearer the

00:47:25.862 --> 00:47:31.234
truth to say that some are born
with saddles on their backs and

00:47:31.234 --> 00:47:34.960
others booted and spurred to
ride them."

00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:39.949
And lastly, there was a kind of
utopian pro-slavery.

00:47:39.949 --> 00:47:44.577
It was best exemplified by a
writer in Mississippi named

00:47:44.577 --> 00:47:48.623
Henry Hughes.
Henry Hughes was one strange

00:47:48.623 --> 00:47:51.317
duck.
He lived in New Orleans,

00:47:51.317 --> 00:47:56.380
he was eccentric as hell.
He wrote an amazing diary.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:00.791
He was a loner.
He urged revival of the

00:48:00.791 --> 00:48:05.965
slave-trade in the late 1850s,
and he developed a theory of

00:48:05.965 --> 00:48:11.050
what he called warranteeism--w-
a-r-r-a-n-t-e-e-i-s-m.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:14.570
He said slaves were not slaves
they were warranties.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:19.763
What he meant was they were the
charges put in the world for

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:23.373
slaveholders to care for,
and if possible,

00:48:23.373 --> 00:48:27.882
even to protect and perfect.
He believed in a strong central

00:48:27.882 --> 00:48:30.831
state, which was a real
departure for him from the rest

00:48:30.831 --> 00:48:34.119
of the pro-slavery writers.
He wanted a strong central

00:48:34.119 --> 00:48:36.340
government to regulate
everything.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:43.347
He wanted huge taxation.
He wanted to build institutions

00:48:43.347 --> 00:48:48.323
that would be used for the sole
purpose of perfecting the slave

00:48:48.323 --> 00:48:53.579
into the perfect worker.
He was a bit of a mad scientist.

00:48:53.579 --> 00:48:58.000
And he was especially obsessed
with racial purity.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.595
His writings are just replete
with his fears about hygiene,

00:49:01.595 --> 00:49:05.438
that if white and black people
touched or if they came together

00:49:05.438 --> 00:49:07.360
the whites would be soiled,

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:13.933
and that any kind of
intermixing of the races was to

00:49:13.933 --> 00:49:15.940
destroy ultimately the
intellect,

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.450
the ability,
the capacity of a master race.

00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:27.111
He wasn't that widely read,
I must admit,

00:49:27.111 --> 00:49:34.000
but it shows us how far
pro-slavery could ultimately go.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:40.208
In Hughes's vision and Hughes's
worldview slavery was not only a

00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:45.431
positive good--it was the
possibility of man finding a

00:49:45.431 --> 00:49:49.885
perfected society,
with the perfect landowners

00:49:49.885 --> 00:49:54.879
fulfilling their obligations,
supported by a government that

00:49:54.879 --> 00:49:58.179
taxed the hell out of them to do
it,

00:49:58.179 --> 00:50:05.039
and perfect workers,
would make the South into the

00:50:05.039 --> 00:50:11.619
agricultural utopian
civilization of history.

00:50:11.619 --> 00:50:14.890
Now, the clock says I've run
out of time.

00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:19.413
Let me just leave you with this.
All of that is a way of simply

00:50:19.413 --> 00:50:24.621
saying it was a deep and abiding
and well-rehearsed--indeed

00:50:24.621 --> 00:50:29.739
thousands of pages were written
in defense of slavery.

00:50:29.739 --> 00:50:35.070
It wasn't just a profitable
financial institution.

00:50:35.070 --> 00:50:39.370
And if you want to understand
why so many white Southerners,

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:44.419
especially in the Deep South,
went to such great extents to

00:50:44.419 --> 00:50:49.805
save their slave society,
remember the kinds of arguments

00:50:49.805 --> 00:50:53.460
and language used by its
defenders.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:58.926
Thursday we'll take up the
North and the critique of this

00:50:58.926 --> 00:50:59.926
ideology.

00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.920
Professor Christine
Hayes: Today we're going to

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.240
be turning to Leviticus.
 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.660
And Leviticus is a primary
document of the Priestly School.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.200
And we identify this work as
Priestly because it deals with

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.375
matters that were of special
concern to and under the

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:17.000
jurisdiction of priests:
the sanctuary,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.672
its cultic rituals,
the system of sacrifices,

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:23.012
the distinction between the
holy and the profane and the

00:00:23.012 --> 00:00:24.470
pure and the impure.
 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.170
So the Priestly materials are
found as a block in Leviticus,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.307
a large part of Numbers,
and then they're scattered

00:00:31.307 --> 00:00:33.440
throughout Genesis and Exodus.
 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.427
And because of these common
themes, we say that they were

00:00:35.427 --> 00:00:37.379
produced by a Priestly School:
we hypothesize a Priestly

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.593
School.
We don't quite clearly

00:00:39.593 --> 00:00:44.650
understand exactly what that
means and who and exactly when.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.550
These materials emerged over a
period of centuries;

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.384
that's clear.
They reached their final form

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.890
in the exilic or post-exilic
period.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.816
But they certainly often
preserve older cultic traditions

00:00:56.816 --> 00:00:59.200
and priestly traditions as well.
 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.631
We can break the book of
Leviticus down into the units

00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:03.649
that are listed on that side of
the board.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.920
You have in chapters 1 through
7 the sacrificial system.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.410
Chapters 8 through 10 recount
the installation of Aaron as

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.146
high priest and the Aaronides
then as the priestly clan within

00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:16.992
Israel.
Chapters 11 through 15 cover

00:01:16.992 --> 00:01:20.872
the dietary system,
the dietary laws as well as the

00:01:20.872 --> 00:01:22.580
ritual purity laws.
 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.230
Chapter 16 describes the
procedure to be followed on the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.420
Day of Atonement or Yom Kippur.
 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.476
Chapters 17 through 26 then are
a block of material that's

00:01:32.476 --> 00:01:36.461
referred to as the "Holiness
code" because of its special

00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:38.239
emphasis on holiness.
 

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:41.729
So most scholars think that
that block of material comes

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.345
from a different priestly
school, and so we designate that

00:01:45.345 --> 00:01:48.548
H: holiness.
The relative dates of P and H,

00:01:48.548 --> 00:01:52.559
P now meaning the non-H parts
of the Priestly materials,

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:55.880
they're much debated;
but I think increasingly,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.523
the consensus is that H--the
block of material in Leviticus

00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:03.292
17 through 26 and then also its
got passages scattered around

00:02:03.292 --> 00:02:06.935
other parts of the Bible--but
the consensus increasingly is

00:02:06.935 --> 00:02:10.639
that H is later.
It's a redactor or editor of

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.060
the other priestly materials.
 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.939
So P is a difficult term of
reference, because P can refer

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:22.220
to the entirety of Priestly
writings altogether.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.921
But when we think about H and
talk about H then P in contrast

00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:28.820
to H means the Priestly writings
that are not H:

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.090
so maybe a small P and a
capital P, I don't know.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.522
Now, the Priestly materials
have for a long time been I

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:38.319
think a devalued part of the
Hebrew Bible.

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.085
And scholarship of the
nineteenth century and most of

00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:45.851
the twentieth century is
generally characterized by a

00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:50.051
deep-seated bias that views
impurity rules as primitive and

00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:53.726
irrational taboos,
and sacrifice as controlled

00:02:53.726 --> 00:02:57.169
savagery that's empty of any
spiritual meaning.

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:01.141
Religion without such rites is
evolutionarily superior or

00:03:01.141 --> 00:03:03.780
higher;
more spiritually meaningful.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.324
And with those kinds of
attitudes, it's not difficult to

00:03:07.324 --> 00:03:11.256
understand why scholarship on
Leviticus and those parts of the

00:03:11.256 --> 00:03:13.770
Bible tend to be rather
dismissive.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.358
In the later part of the
twentieth century,

00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:18.330
the situation began to change.
 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.671
As anthropologists and
ethnographers began to study the

00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:26.370
danger avoidance practices of
many cultures,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.021
the taboos and rituals of many
cultures, including modern

00:03:30.021 --> 00:03:32.956
Western culture,
new avenues for understanding

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:37.129
the danger avoidance practices
of the Bible began to emerge.

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.374
Anthropologist Mary Douglas
changed forever the way scholars

00:03:41.374 --> 00:03:44.900
would approach the impurity
rules of the Bible,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.299
because she insisted on their
interpretation as symbols,

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.193
symbols that conveyed something
meaningful to those who followed

00:03:52.193 --> 00:03:54.373
them.
Biblical scholars like Jacob

00:03:54.373 --> 00:03:56.810
Milgrom and more recently
Jonathan Klawans,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.710
attuned to developments in the
social sciences,

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.189
have made very great advances
in our understanding of

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:05.129
Israelite purity practices.
 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.817
They've tended to view the
elaborate and carefully

00:04:08.817 --> 00:04:12.956
constructed texts of P as part
of a system whose meaning

00:04:12.956 --> 00:04:17.547
derives from the larger cultural
matrix or grid in which those

00:04:17.547 --> 00:04:19.730
materials are embedded.
 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.412
How much the system laid down
by P represents what ordinary

00:04:25.412 --> 00:04:28.939
Israelite Judeans thought and
did;

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:32.490
how much these rules were
actually enacted and followed;

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.490
how much they drew upon older
random practices,

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.839
brought them together,
modified them,

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:40.839
imposed some semblance of order
upon them;

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:44.956
how much the represent just he
ideal construction or blueprint

00:04:44.956 --> 00:04:47.925
of an elite group:
these are all unanswerable

00:04:47.925 --> 00:04:49.720
questions.
The fact is,

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.209
no one really knows.
 

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:54.908
But we do know from living
cultures that people do engage

00:04:54.908 --> 00:04:58.409
in all kinds of ritual and
symbolic actions because of

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.240
genuine beliefs about the
importance of those actions,

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.993
because those rituals and
symbols are extraordinarily

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:07.509
meaningful to them.
 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.622
And in any event,
our primary concern is with the

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:13.476
program of the texts as they
stand before us:

00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:16.069
is there a symbolism operating
here?

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.137
What are the key ideas and the
key themes of the Priestly

00:05:19.137 --> 00:05:21.220
material?
How do these ideas or how does

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.082
this material jive with other
aspects of Israelite religion

00:05:24.082 --> 00:05:25.759
that we've talked about so far?
 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.610
What ultimately is the purpose
toward which these materials are

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.109
aiming?
Well, like the rest of the

00:05:32.109 --> 00:05:35.167
ancient world,
Israel had a cultic system,

00:05:35.167 --> 00:05:39.867
and that cultic system featured
a sanctuary: a sacred space with

00:05:39.867 --> 00:05:42.363
holy objects;
sacred objects,

00:05:42.363 --> 00:05:46.209
where priests performed a
variety of ritual acts.

00:05:46.209 --> 00:05:50.153
So Israelite-Judean religion on
the ground shared many cultic

00:05:50.153 --> 00:05:54.228
forms and practices and rituals
with Canaanite and Ancient Near

00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:56.199
Eastern culture generally.
 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.860
Sanctuaries in the ancient
world were understood to be the

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.259
dwelling place of the deity.
 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:04.050
Sacrifices were offered to the
deity in his or her sanctuary.

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.791
P describes a portable
sanctuary, a mishkan,

00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.709
that's used in the wilderness
period.

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:13.621
Now, if you look on your
handout, there's a

00:06:13.621 --> 00:06:17.989
reconstruction of this tent-like
sanctuary at the top as well as

00:06:17.989 --> 00:06:20.970
a schematization of its contents
below.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.216
So woven curtains hung from
wooden frames that could easily

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:27.560
be assembled and disassembled.
 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.160
And these curtains surround the
sacred precincts.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.930
You see that in the top picture.
 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.568
And within those precincts,
within that enclosure,

00:06:34.568 --> 00:06:36.399
there's a large,
open courtyard.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:38.930
That was accessible to all
Israelites.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.306
The main sacrificial altar with
a large ramp stood in that

00:06:42.306 --> 00:06:45.860
courtyard as well as a basin
that was there for ablutions.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.129
And then halfway across the
courtyard, there was a screen

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.339
that marked the entrance to
another little enclosure,

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.560
which is the shrine proper,
the sanctuary proper;

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.410
and only priests have access to
that area.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.129
The shrine or sanctuary housed
an incense altar.

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:06.643
And then on one side a
seven-branched lampstand or

00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:08.395
menorah.
And on the other,

00:07:08.395 --> 00:07:11.865
a table, which held loaves of
bread that were changed on a

00:07:11.865 --> 00:07:14.829
weekly basis.
The backmost square-shaped

00:07:14.829 --> 00:07:19.725
chamber of that inner shrine was
the inner sanctum or the holy of

00:07:19.725 --> 00:07:22.254
holies.
And that was accessible only to

00:07:22.254 --> 00:07:25.612
the high priest and only on the
Day of Atonement following a

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:28.060
series of heightened purity
observances.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.709
Inside that holy of holies was
the ark.

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:32.949
It was about four feet by
two-and-a-half feet.

00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:35.160
It was a wooden ark covered in
gold.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.360
On top was a kind of covering.
 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.930
It's referred to as a
kapporeth:

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:40.750
we don't really know what this
word means,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.766
it's traditionally translated
"mercy seat," I think that's how

00:07:43.766 --> 00:07:45.199
the JPS might translate it.
 

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:49.566
But it's some kind of gold
cover and then there were two

00:07:49.566 --> 00:07:54.410
cherubim, these enormous winged
lions that flanked the ark.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.730
Likely they were connected to
that mercy seat cover.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.589
If so, then what they were was
a throne.

00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:04.225
And we have in Ancient Near
Eastern iconography thrones of

00:08:04.225 --> 00:08:06.486
this type.
We have pictures of gods and

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.898
kings seated on these seats,
the sides of which are these

00:08:09.898 --> 00:08:13.005
giant winged cherubim,
and then their feet rest on a

00:08:13.005 --> 00:08:15.784
footstool.
Likewise, in some biblical

00:08:15.784 --> 00:08:19.729
verses, God or Yahweh is
described as enthroned upon the

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:22.231
cherubim.
The ark then is said to serve

00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:23.250
as his footstool.
 

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:26.246
So that's sort of the box that
he would have rested his feet

00:08:26.246 --> 00:08:28.296
on.
The ark itself contained the

00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:29.899
tablets of the covenant.
 

00:08:29.899 --> 00:08:32.915
And so it was a testament to
the covenant between God and

00:08:32.915 --> 00:08:34.292
Israel.
Interestingly,

00:08:34.292 --> 00:08:37.159
unlike most ancient
sanctuaries, the Israelite

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:40.409
sanctuary did not contain a
statue of the deity.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:44.146
And that's I think evidence of
the very strong aniconic

00:08:44.146 --> 00:08:46.429
tendency of Israelite religion.
 

00:08:46.429 --> 00:08:49.301
Nevertheless,
God was believed to be present

00:08:49.301 --> 00:08:50.570
in the sanctuary.
 

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.120
Often in the form of a cloud
that will fill,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.669
that will descend to fill the
tabernacle,

00:08:55.669 --> 00:08:58.354
particularly as it's assembled
in a new encampment,

00:08:58.354 --> 00:09:01.414
and then God will descend down
and the cloud will fill the

00:09:01.414 --> 00:09:04.849
tabernacle.
So it is God's presence there

00:09:04.849 --> 00:09:09.110
that sanctifies,
which simply means "makes holy,

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:12.736
makes sacred," to sanctify,
to make holy,

00:09:12.736 --> 00:09:15.927
the tabernacle.
And to understand this,

00:09:15.927 --> 00:09:19.460
we need to understand the
Priestly conception of holiness.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.500
Now, the Hebrew word "holy" has
a root meaning of separate.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.659
Separate.
That which is holy is separate.

00:09:26.659 --> 00:09:29.139
It's withdrawn from common,
everyday use.

00:09:29.139 --> 00:09:34.300
In the Priestly view,
only God is intrinsically holy;

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.049
intrinsically holy.
 

00:09:36.049 --> 00:09:38.723
God can impart holiness to,
he can sanctify,

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:42.206
persons and places and things
when they're brought into a

00:09:42.206 --> 00:09:44.879
specific kind of relationship
with him,

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:48.272
a relationship that's best
described as a relationship of

00:09:48.272 --> 00:09:50.616
ownership.
What is holy is what is in

00:09:50.616 --> 00:09:53.600
God's realm, something that's
separated to him.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.210
That which is outside God's
realm is common.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.228
The Hebrew word for "common" is
sometimes translated by the

00:10:00.228 --> 00:10:01.529
English word "profane."
 

00:10:01.529 --> 00:10:04.401
That has a negative connotation
in English, but in fact it

00:10:04.401 --> 00:10:06.820
really doesn't bear that
negative connotation.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.210
Profane simply means not holy;
not sacred.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.080
We use it differently now.
 

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.662
But the fact is that the common
or profane state is the natural

00:10:15.662 --> 00:10:18.840
default state of most objects
and things.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.432
This table is just profane.
 

00:10:20.432 --> 00:10:22.190
It's common.
It's available for everyday use.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:25.621
It's not separated or marked
off for special kind of

00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:27.639
treatment because it's holy.
 

00:10:27.639 --> 00:10:31.682
For a common object to become
holy, you need a special act of

00:10:31.682 --> 00:10:34.778
dedication to God,
an act of sanctification to

00:10:34.778 --> 00:10:38.600
transfer the thing to God or
God's realm or God's service.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.414
So holiness entails necessarily
separation in both its positive

00:10:43.414 --> 00:10:45.200
and negative aspects.
 

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.890
It entails separation of an
object to that which sanctifies

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.221
it, which is God;
and it involves separation

00:10:52.221 --> 00:10:57.034
from, in the form of safeguards
against, anything that would

00:10:57.034 --> 00:10:59.889
threaten to remove its sanctity.
 

00:10:59.889 --> 00:11:02.690
So separation from that which
threatens its sanctity.

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.281
Holy things are holy because
they are removed from the realm

00:11:06.281 --> 00:11:09.872
of the common by means of rules
or safeguards that demarcate

00:11:09.872 --> 00:11:13.524
them as different and separate
and determine that we use them

00:11:13.524 --> 00:11:16.960
differently.
The preservation of holy status

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.659
therefore depends on those rules
and safeguards.

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:24.474
Their observance protects the
holy object from profanation,

00:11:24.474 --> 00:11:27.828
from being profaned,
reverting from holy status back

00:11:27.828 --> 00:11:29.210
to common status.
 

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.722
Now, it's evident from the
schematic representation or the

00:11:32.722 --> 00:11:36.543
way I've described the sanctuary
that holiness increases as you

00:11:36.543 --> 00:11:38.700
move deeper into the sanctuary.
 

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:43.083
And the principle here that
holiness increases as proximity

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:44.519
to God increases.
 

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:49.299
The principle is graphically
demonstrated in spatial terms.

00:11:49.299 --> 00:11:53.149
So in the biblical view,
the area or the land outside

00:11:53.149 --> 00:11:56.850
the Israelite camp is just
common, profane land.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.639
The Israelite camp bears a
certain degree of holiness.

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:03.166
Then as you move in,
the outer courtyard,

00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:06.514
the outer enclosure of the
sanctuary, bears a slightly

00:12:06.514 --> 00:12:08.409
higher degree of holiness.
 

00:12:08.409 --> 00:12:11.889
It's accessible to Israelites
who are pure.

00:12:11.889 --> 00:12:14.922
The sanctuary proper,
which is in closer proximity to

00:12:14.922 --> 00:12:18.420
God, bears a still higher degree
of holiness: it's accessible

00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.411
only to the priests,
who are said to be the holy

00:12:21.411 --> 00:12:22.590
ones within Israel.
 

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.063
And then the inner shrine is
the holiest area:

00:12:25.063 --> 00:12:28.140
it's accessible only to the
holiest member of the nation,

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.186
the high priest.
You have similar concentric

00:12:31.186 --> 00:12:34.503
circles of holiness
characterizing the priestly

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:36.090
conception of time.
 

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:39.305
There are ordinary,
common, profane days,

00:12:39.305 --> 00:12:41.640
work days.
Then there are certain holy

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.976
days: for example,
the New Year or the Passover

00:12:43.976 --> 00:12:46.820
holidays--that's where our word
"holiday" comes from,

00:12:46.820 --> 00:12:50.028
holy day--and they are
separated and demarcated from

00:12:50.028 --> 00:12:53.740
common time by special rules
that mark them as different.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.519
Holier than these days is the
Sabbath, which is demarcated by

00:12:57.519 --> 00:12:59.850
even further rules and
observances.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.840
And the holiest day is Yom
Kippur, known as the Sabbath of

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.585
Sabbaths.
This day is separated from all

00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:10.603
other days by additional rules
and observances in keeping with

00:13:10.603 --> 00:13:12.250
its profound holiness.
 

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.644
The holiness of persons,
of objects, of time and of

00:13:16.644 --> 00:13:19.720
space all converge on Yom
Kippur,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.875
because it's only on this most
holy day that the most holy

00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:27.597
person, high priest,
enters the most holy of holies,

00:13:27.597 --> 00:13:31.080
the innermost shrine,
and performs a ritual upon the

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:35.861
most holy of objects,
the mercy seat and ark itself

00:13:35.861 --> 00:13:38.732
once a year.
Well, now we need to consider

00:13:38.732 --> 00:13:41.809
the deep connection that exists
between holiness and purity.

00:13:41.809 --> 00:13:44.733
Because the two are not
identical despite massive

00:13:44.733 --> 00:13:47.595
amounts of scholarship that
confuses this issue:

00:13:47.595 --> 00:13:50.890
thinks holy means pure,
thinks common means impure,

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.702
and it just doesn't:
these are different binary

00:13:53.702 --> 00:13:56.809
oppositions.
The two are not identical.

00:13:56.809 --> 00:14:01.110
To be holy means to belong to
or to be in the realm of God.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:06.537
Things can't become holy and
can't come into contact with the

00:14:06.537 --> 00:14:10.879
holy or the sacred if they are
not first pure.

00:14:10.879 --> 00:14:16.399
Purity, which is the absence of
impurity, is a prerequisite for

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:19.960
access to the holy or for holy
status.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.399
To be in a state of purity
simply means that one is

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:27.870
qualified to contact the sacred:
to enter the sacred precincts,

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.649
to handle sacred objects,
and so on.

00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:34.644
To be in a state of impurity
simply means that one is not

00:14:34.644 --> 00:14:37.070
qualified to contact the sacred.
 

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:39.580
So if you're impure at home and
just minding your own business,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.350
it's no big deal.
 

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.436
It's only a problem if you
decide you want to go to the

00:14:42.436 --> 00:14:44.982
sanctuary.
So purity and impurity are

00:14:44.982 --> 00:14:49.308
states of qualification or
disqualification for contact

00:14:49.308 --> 00:14:53.711
with sancta.
The holy is by definition pure:

00:14:53.711 --> 00:14:57.335
by definition.
Only that which is free of

00:14:57.335 --> 00:14:59.809
impurity can contact the holy.
 

00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:02.776
If an impure object--and you
will see here these overlapping

00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:05.842
pairs, which were also in your
handout--if you can imagine the

00:15:05.842 --> 00:15:08.960
lower pair sort of being plunked
down on top of this pair,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.705
that will give you an idea of
what we're trying to convey with

00:15:11.705 --> 00:15:12.559
this image.
Okay?

00:15:12.559 --> 00:15:15.620
Things are either holy or
common.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.279
But if they're holy,
they must be pure.

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:20.019
Common objects can be pure or
impure;

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:22.379
it just depends whether or not
they've been in contact with a

00:15:22.379 --> 00:15:23.480
source of impurity or not.
 

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.415
Alright?
If--but notice that the holy

00:15:26.415 --> 00:15:30.186
and the impure are never
conjoined--if an impure object

00:15:30.186 --> 00:15:32.909
comes in contact with a holy
object,

00:15:32.909 --> 00:15:35.750
then the holy object is
immediately defiled;

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.309
it's immediately rendered
impure.

00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:40.317
The word "defiled" means to
take on some form of ritual

00:15:40.317 --> 00:15:42.746
impurity.
And it loses its holy status

00:15:42.746 --> 00:15:46.803
automatically.
So it becomes both impure and

00:15:46.803 --> 00:15:48.384
profane.
To be restored,

00:15:48.384 --> 00:15:50.759
then, you're going to have to
have two things happening.

00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:52.567
First of all,
it's got to be purified--you've

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:54.210
got to get rid of the ritual
impurity,

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:58.028
so there'll have to be some
ritual procedure that purges the

00:15:58.028 --> 00:15:59.707
impurity.
So once you've done that,

00:15:59.707 --> 00:16:03.159
you've made it pure;
but it's still common, profane.

00:16:03.159 --> 00:16:05.318
So it has to,
if it's to be made holy again,

00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:08.029
it has to be rededicated or
given over to God again,

00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:10.342
re-sanctified:
maybe a little holy anointing

00:16:10.342 --> 00:16:12.278
oil poured on it,
that's one means of

00:16:12.278 --> 00:16:14.909
sanctification;
simply handing it over to God,

00:16:14.909 --> 00:16:17.912
elevating it towards God is
another way of re-sanctifying

00:16:17.912 --> 00:16:20.866
something.
But there has to be two steps:

00:16:20.866 --> 00:16:25.003
a purification and then a
sanctification to make it holy

00:16:25.003 --> 00:16:28.054
again.
Increased access to the holy

00:16:28.054 --> 00:16:32.379
requires increased,
an increased degree of purity.

00:16:32.379 --> 00:16:34.720
That's the connection between
holiness and purity.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:38.087
So the purity that's required
of a priest, who has access to

00:16:38.087 --> 00:16:41.121
the sanctuary proper,
is higher than that of an

00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:44.909
Israelite, who has access to the
outer courtyard only.

00:16:44.909 --> 00:16:48.669
The purity required of the high
priest is even greater.

00:16:48.669 --> 00:16:51.202
So to be pure,
one must separate ones self

00:16:51.202 --> 00:16:52.870
from sources of impurity.
 

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:54.649
What are these sources of
impurity?

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:57.657
And I hope you've had a chance
to look at the reading material,

00:16:57.657 --> 00:17:00.470
because I'm going to go through
this relatively quickly.

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:04.628
Jonathan Klawans has been the
most vocal proponent of the

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:08.713
claim that biblical texts speak
of two distinct types of

00:17:08.713 --> 00:17:11.980
impurity: ritual impurity and
moral impurity,

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.059
which I have up here .
 

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:17.041
You've read the short article
he has in the Jewish Study

00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:20.176
Bible, but he's also written
about this at great length in

00:17:20.176 --> 00:17:22.657
other places.
And according to Klawans and

00:17:22.657 --> 00:17:25.986
others, ritual impurity arises
from physical substances and

00:17:25.986 --> 00:17:28.569
states which are not in
themselves sinful.

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:31.237
There's no intimate connection
with sin when we're talking

00:17:31.237 --> 00:17:32.359
about ritual impurity.
 

00:17:32.359 --> 00:17:35.431
In fact, a lot of ritual
impurity is unavoidable and

00:17:35.431 --> 00:17:37.539
sometimes even obligatory,
right?

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:39.601
Sexual contact makes one
ritually impure,

00:17:39.601 --> 00:17:42.589
and yet God commands humans to
be fruitful and multiply.

00:17:42.589 --> 00:17:44.526
Burying the dead makes one
ritually impure,

00:17:44.526 --> 00:17:46.509
but God commands proper care of
the dead.

00:17:46.509 --> 00:17:51.580
So there's nothing inherently
sinful about contracting ritual

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.640
impurity.
Ritual impurity,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.316
which is generally permitted,
is distinguished by the

00:17:57.316 --> 00:18:00.779
characteristics I've quickly
jotted down here.

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:03.615
It's contagious,
that is, it's transferred to

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:07.224
other persons or objects,
depending on how receptive they

00:18:07.224 --> 00:18:11.826
are--perhaps by physical touch,
perhaps in the case of severe

00:18:11.826 --> 00:18:16.763
impurity by sharing an enclosed
space, by being together under

00:18:16.763 --> 00:18:19.109
an overhanging roof,
tent.

00:18:19.109 --> 00:18:21.650
Ritual impurity is also
impermanent.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:25.914
It can be removed or reduced
through rituals of ablutions or

00:18:25.914 --> 00:18:29.383
just the passage of time or
other sorts of ritual

00:18:29.383 --> 00:18:33.222
observances.
Ritual impurity also defiles or

00:18:33.222 --> 00:18:37.203
renders impure sancta,
and so it has to be kept

00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:39.279
separate from sancta.
 

00:18:39.279 --> 00:18:42.497
In very severe cases,
it can even defile some common

00:18:42.497 --> 00:18:46.463
objects, and in those cases,
the source of impurity might

00:18:46.463 --> 00:18:49.869
have to be isolated or excluded
if necessary.

00:18:49.869 --> 00:18:53.519
Now, the concept of ritual
impurity was a central and

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:57.589
integral feature of most,
if not all, ancient religions.

00:18:57.589 --> 00:19:00.893
And the biblical laws of purity
and impurity strongly resemble

00:19:00.893 --> 00:19:03.276
those of other Ancient Near
Eastern cultures:

00:19:03.276 --> 00:19:05.930
Egyptian, Mesopotamian,
even Hittite culture.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:08.638
And certainly,
there are Ancient Near Eastern

00:19:08.638 --> 00:19:11.900
and Canaanite roots for
Israelite purity practices.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:15.838
But the system of ritual purity
and impurity that is crafted in

00:19:15.838 --> 00:19:19.268
the Priestly writings of the
Hebrew Bible represents an

00:19:19.268 --> 00:19:23.164
attempt to monotheize,
to monotheize Israelite purity

00:19:23.164 --> 00:19:27.878
practices and to create a system
that differentiated Israel from

00:19:27.878 --> 00:19:29.599
her close neighbors.
 

00:19:29.599 --> 00:19:33.062
So, for example,
impurity was often connected

00:19:33.062 --> 00:19:36.839
with belief in evil spirits and
impure demons.

00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:40.642
It's quite possible that
Israel's purification rituals

00:19:40.642 --> 00:19:44.517
may have originated and even
long endured as rituals of

00:19:44.517 --> 00:19:48.822
exorcism that expelled a demon
who was believed to be causing

00:19:48.822 --> 00:19:51.190
the affliction in question.
 

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.250
That may be their origin and
source;

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:57.804
but in the Priestly writings,
impurity is generally divorced

00:19:57.804 --> 00:20:00.970
from any association with evil
spirits.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:05.422
Some scholars theorize that the
ritual purity system reflects an

00:20:05.422 --> 00:20:08.390
original concern with health or
hygiene.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.549
But this isn't very convincing.
 

00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:13.693
Only one set of diseases is
said to generate ritual

00:20:13.693 --> 00:20:17.151
impurity, and many substances
that are widely considered

00:20:17.151 --> 00:20:19.980
unhygienic by most cultures--for
example,

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:23.097
human and animal
excrement--these are not sources

00:20:23.097 --> 00:20:25.759
of ritual impurity to Israel's
priests.

00:20:25.759 --> 00:20:29.383
So Klawans is among those who
insist that any effort to

00:20:29.383 --> 00:20:33.208
understand the purpose and the
meaning of Israelite purity

00:20:33.208 --> 00:20:37.436
practices as schematized by the
monotheizing Priestly writers in

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:41.329
Leviticus 12 through 16--and
again whether actual Israelite

00:20:41.329 --> 00:20:45.019
Judeans did this or understood
things this way,

00:20:45.019 --> 00:20:48.332
we'll never know--but to
understand the schematization

00:20:48.332 --> 00:20:51.207
of, the monotheizing
schematization of Israel's

00:20:51.207 --> 00:20:54.480
purity practices,
we would do better to ignore

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:58.470
questions of origins and to
attend to the larger symbolism

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:01.410
of impurity and holiness in
these writings:

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:04.237
in particular,
we need to try to understand

00:21:04.237 --> 00:21:07.500
the antithetical relationship
between impurity and holiness.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.150
The two are opposites.
 

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.822
They are opposed and
antagonistic towards one

00:21:11.822 --> 00:21:13.775
another.
So Klawans points out,

00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:16.037
as you know,
that there are three main

00:21:16.037 --> 00:21:17.750
sources of impurity in P.
 

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.462
First of all,
corpses and certain carcasses

00:21:20.462 --> 00:21:23.497
are a source of ritual
impurity: sara'at,

00:21:23.497 --> 00:21:27.113
which is this--we translate it
"scale disease," it's been

00:21:27.113 --> 00:21:30.490
called leprosy.
It's definitely not leprosy.

00:21:30.490 --> 00:21:34.453
People who know such things
have read the details in the

00:21:34.453 --> 00:21:38.849
biblical texts and it's not what
is truly known as leprosy.

00:21:38.849 --> 00:21:42.507
But it's some sort of skin
disease, flaking skin disease or

00:21:42.507 --> 00:21:45.724
other sorts of boils and skin
states that seem to be

00:21:45.724 --> 00:21:48.413
associated,
at least in the Israelite mind,

00:21:48.413 --> 00:21:50.099
with decomposition and death.
 

00:21:50.099 --> 00:21:52.339
We have a couple of passages,
one in the book of Numbers,

00:21:52.339 --> 00:21:55.479
one in the book of Job,
which describe this condition

00:21:55.479 --> 00:21:58.430
in a way that identifies it with
death.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.075
An aborted fetus is often
described as looking like it has

00:22:01.075 --> 00:22:02.839
this condition,
for example--not often,

00:22:02.839 --> 00:22:04.650
it happens once in the book of
Job.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.743
But the point is there's a
connection between this

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:11.278
condition, this skin condition,
and its decomposition and

00:22:11.278 --> 00:22:13.611
death.
The third source of ritual

00:22:13.611 --> 00:22:17.014
impurity would be genital
discharges, both normal and

00:22:17.014 --> 00:22:19.533
diseased.
So Klawans notes in the article

00:22:19.533 --> 00:22:22.666
you read that the physical
substances and states that are

00:22:22.666 --> 00:22:26.077
labeled impure and are therefore
designated as antithetical to

00:22:26.077 --> 00:22:29.545
the realm of holiness are states
that are associated with death

00:22:29.545 --> 00:22:32.510
on the one hand,
and procreation on the other.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.240
Why should this be?
 

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:38.188
The Priestly conception of god,
you will recall,

00:22:38.188 --> 00:22:41.380
is of an immortal and asexual
being.

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.215
Think back to the first
creation story,

00:22:43.215 --> 00:22:45.099
which is the Priestly creation
story.

00:22:45.099 --> 00:22:49.893
To enter the realm of the holy,
in which there is neither death

00:22:49.893 --> 00:22:53.140
nor procreation,
requires a separation from

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.150
death and procreation.
 

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:59.339
It is association with death
and sexuality that renders one

00:22:59.339 --> 00:23:03.890
impure and disqualifies one from
entering the holy sanctuary.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:07.852
That is not to say that one
shouldn't deal with death or

00:23:07.852 --> 00:23:10.950
sexuality in the ordinary course
of life.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.393
On the contrary,
God explicitly commands humans

00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:16.103
to be fruitful and multiply,
and he does that in the

00:23:16.103 --> 00:23:17.910
P-source, right?
In Genesis 1.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.773
He commands proper care of the
dead, and he also does that in

00:23:21.773 --> 00:23:24.920
the P-source.
It simply means that one cannot

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.522
enter the holy sanctuary,
God's realm,

00:23:27.522 --> 00:23:31.390
when impure through contact
with death or sexuality.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:35.209
So according to Klawans,
ritual purification involved

00:23:35.209 --> 00:23:39.323
separation from those aspects of
humanity, death and sex,

00:23:39.323 --> 00:23:41.380
that are least God-like.
 

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:45.384
To enter God's realm requires
imitation of God or imitatio

00:23:45.384 --> 00:23:48.387
dei, right,
an idea that I put up here,

00:23:48.387 --> 00:23:50.990
imitatio dei:
imitation of god.

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:54.697
And Klawans further argues that
the concept of imitatio

00:23:54.697 --> 00:23:58.339
dei also explains the
practice of sacrifice which,

00:23:58.339 --> 00:24:01.443
on the face of it,
contradicts the idea that you

00:24:01.443 --> 00:24:04.349
must avoid death in connection
with the holy,

00:24:04.349 --> 00:24:06.525
right?
Because sacrifice entails

00:24:06.525 --> 00:24:10.282
killing right in the sanctuary,
killing of animals right in the

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.354
sanctuary.
So Klawans argues,

00:24:12.354 --> 00:24:15.137
and I quote,
that "sacrifice involves in

00:24:15.137 --> 00:24:19.561
part the controlled exercise of
complete power over an animal's

00:24:19.561 --> 00:24:23.627
life and death."
Which is, he says "…precisely

00:24:23.627 --> 00:24:29.009
one of the powers that Israel's
God exercises over human beings.

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:31.771
As God is to humanity,
humans in imitation of God are

00:24:31.771 --> 00:24:33.789
towards their domesticated
animals."

00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:36.727
So the process of sacrifice,
I won't go into his argument

00:24:36.727 --> 00:24:39.875
here, but Klawans develops a
strong argument that the process

00:24:39.875 --> 00:24:43.075
of sacrifice can be understood
itself as an act of imitatio

00:24:43.075 --> 00:24:45.738
dei,
because sacrifice involves a

00:24:45.738 --> 00:24:49.803
variety of behaviors in the
biblical text that are analogous

00:24:49.803 --> 00:24:53.523
to behaviors attributed
elsewhere in the biblical texts

00:24:53.523 --> 00:24:58.069
to God: the care and feeding and
raising of domestic animals,

00:24:58.069 --> 00:25:00.837
the selection of one that is
deemed perfect,

00:25:00.837 --> 00:25:03.670
control over its life and death
and so on.

00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:06.740
And these are all spoken of in
terms that are analogous to

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:09.811
terms used to describe God as
the shepherd of his flock of

00:25:09.811 --> 00:25:12.720
Israel and in control of life
and death and so on.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.821
So Klawans argues that the
process of sacrifice,

00:25:15.821 --> 00:25:19.385
which grants the offerer
complete control over life and

00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:22.289
death, is a kind of imitatio
dei.

00:25:22.289 --> 00:25:24.501
But Klawans also asserts,
and I quote,

00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:27.727
that "Imitatio dei does
not exhaustively explain

00:25:27.727 --> 00:25:30.470
sacrifice in ancient Israel,"
and in fact,

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:34.260
we should be surprised if any
one single theory would indeed

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.609
explain sacrifice.
 

00:25:35.609 --> 00:25:38.771
So he just says that there are
really two organizing principles

00:25:38.771 --> 00:25:41.627
or overriding concerns in the
Priestly traditions and the

00:25:41.627 --> 00:25:43.819
Priestly materials regarding
sacrifice.

00:25:43.819 --> 00:25:46.890
The first, as we've seen,
is imitatio dei.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:51.347
But the second is a desire to
attract and maintain the divine

00:25:51.347 --> 00:25:55.730
presence, the continued presence
of God in the sanctuary.

00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:59.045
The majority of the sacrifices
that are described in the

00:25:59.045 --> 00:26:02.361
opening chapters of Leviticus,
in Leviticus 1 through 7,

00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:04.109
are voluntary sacrifices.
 

00:26:04.109 --> 00:26:07.637
These are sacrifices that are
offered as gifts or in times of

00:26:07.637 --> 00:26:10.051
celebration.
I put a little list of them up

00:26:10.051 --> 00:26:13.128
here, but the first three are
the ones that will concern us

00:26:13.128 --> 00:26:14.602
now.
We have first of all,

00:26:14.602 --> 00:26:17.384
the whole offering or "burnt
offering," it's sometimes

00:26:17.384 --> 00:26:19.327
called.
This is when an animal is

00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:21.766
entirely burned to create,
as the text says,

00:26:21.766 --> 00:26:24.885
a pleasant smelling odor or
pleasant smelling smoke that

00:26:24.885 --> 00:26:27.228
ascends to God.
So according to P,

00:26:27.228 --> 00:26:30.788
the priests are to offer two
such burnt offerings with

00:26:30.788 --> 00:26:33.811
pleasing-smelling odors to the
Lord every day:

00:26:33.811 --> 00:26:37.773
one in the morning and one in
the evening on a regular basis

00:26:37.773 --> 00:26:39.519
from the community.
 

00:26:39.519 --> 00:26:42.152
The second kind of offering
that's described is the grain

00:26:42.152 --> 00:26:44.781
offering.
This is a gift of flour and oil

00:26:44.781 --> 00:26:48.731
and incense, which is burned
after a portion is removed for

00:26:48.731 --> 00:26:51.319
the priests as dues to the
priests,

00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:54.717
the rest is burned on the altar
again with a sweet smell from

00:26:54.717 --> 00:26:56.860
the incense.
Third, we have a set of

00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:00.207
offerings known as well-being
offerings, "peace offerings"

00:27:00.207 --> 00:27:01.910
it's sometimes translated.
 

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:06.611
These offerings are generally
consumed by the offerer and his

00:27:06.611 --> 00:27:10.059
family, very often in a festive
situation,

00:27:10.059 --> 00:27:12.553
as a big feast,
after certain portions are

00:27:12.553 --> 00:27:14.500
donated to the priests,
again.

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.950
Well-being offerings are of
three main types.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:19.279
You have the thanksgiving
offering.

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:22.214
You have a freewill
offering--just because someone

00:27:22.214 --> 00:27:24.609
wants to do this,
a freewill offering.

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:27.414
And you have a vow offering
that would be offered on the

00:27:27.414 --> 00:27:29.759
successful completion of a vow,
for example.

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:32.579
And these sacrifices are all
entirely optional.

00:27:32.579 --> 00:27:34.309
They were offered in
celebration.

00:27:34.309 --> 00:27:37.001
They were offered in
thanksgiving or upon the

00:27:37.001 --> 00:27:39.019
successful completion of a vow.
 

00:27:39.019 --> 00:27:41.556
In other words,
the sacrificial cult was

00:27:41.556 --> 00:27:45.133
primarily a vehicle for
worshipers' expression of a wide

00:27:45.133 --> 00:27:48.579
range of emotions:
joy over the birth of a child,

00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:52.349
thankfulness for a good harvest
and so on.

00:27:52.349 --> 00:27:56.265
Now, texts from Ancient Near
Eastern cultures suggest that a

00:27:56.265 --> 00:27:59.782
central function of the rituals
that were performed in

00:27:59.782 --> 00:28:03.764
sanctuaries was to secure the
perpetual aid and blessing of a

00:28:03.764 --> 00:28:05.490
well-disposed deity.
 

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:07.892
And in important ways,
the Israelite cult is

00:28:07.892 --> 00:28:10.629
strikingly similar,
particularly in the sacrifices

00:28:10.629 --> 00:28:11.970
I've just described.
 

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.891
The Israelites certainly hoped
to secure the perpetual aid and

00:28:15.891 --> 00:28:19.170
blessing and protection of a
well-disposed deity.

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:22.602
Blessing and benefaction flow
from God's presence in the midst

00:28:22.602 --> 00:28:25.472
of the community in his
sanctuary: when he is there,

00:28:25.472 --> 00:28:26.710
there is blessing.
 

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:30.080
So Klawans follows earlier
scholars in suggesting that the

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.806
rituals and sacrifices performed
in this sanctuary were designed

00:28:33.806 --> 00:28:37.177
to ensure God's continued
residence within and blessing of

00:28:37.177 --> 00:28:39.307
the community.
In particular,

00:28:39.307 --> 00:28:43.097
the daily burnt offerings
sacrificed by the priests twice

00:28:43.097 --> 00:28:46.055
each day,
and emitting this pleasing

00:28:46.055 --> 00:28:50.099
odor: these were an effort to
attract the deity.

00:28:50.099 --> 00:28:52.973
Likewise, the gifts--the other
foods and pleasing odors of the

00:28:52.973 --> 00:28:55.659
sacrifices brought by individual
worshipers--attracted and

00:28:55.659 --> 00:28:57.826
maintained the continued
presence of God in the

00:28:57.826 --> 00:28:59.649
sanctuary.
So this is the second

00:28:59.649 --> 00:29:02.652
overriding concern or organizing
principle of the sacrifice:

00:29:02.652 --> 00:29:05.859
not simply that there should be
imitatio dei within God's

00:29:05.859 --> 00:29:07.992
realm,
but also that the activities

00:29:07.992 --> 00:29:10.912
there should attract and
maintain the presence of the

00:29:10.912 --> 00:29:13.440
deity for the well-being of the
community.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.895
But just as God is attracted by
certain kinds of behaviors,

00:29:17.895 --> 00:29:20.200
so he is repelled by others.
 

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.245
And in the Priestly system,
grave sins generate an

00:29:24.245 --> 00:29:28.713
impurity, now a moral impurity,
so now we're coming to the

00:29:28.713 --> 00:29:32.335
second kind of impurity,
moral impurity that repels the

00:29:32.335 --> 00:29:35.200
divine presence.
Okay?

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.654
So moral impurity is the second
kind of impurity that's

00:29:38.654 --> 00:29:40.829
described by Klawans and others.
 

00:29:40.829 --> 00:29:45.837
In contrast to ritual impurity,
moral impurity does arise from

00:29:45.837 --> 00:29:47.890
the commission of sins.
 

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:50.606
Ritual impurity does not:
there's nothing that's

00:29:50.606 --> 00:29:54.017
prohibitive about-- you're never
told not to become ritually

00:29:54.017 --> 00:29:56.877
impure, okay?
There's nothing sinful about

00:29:56.877 --> 00:29:59.335
it, inherently.
But moral impurity arises

00:29:59.335 --> 00:30:02.383
specifically from the commission
of certain heinous sins

00:30:02.383 --> 00:30:05.980
specifically.
The three that I've listed here

00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.915
are the biggies:
idolatry, homicide and sexual

00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:13.176
transgressions.
These are spelled out in

00:30:13.176 --> 00:30:16.759
Leviticus 18 and Leviticus 20,
those two chapters.

00:30:16.759 --> 00:30:21.723
Besides defiling the sinner,
moral impurity symbolically

00:30:21.723 --> 00:30:25.904
defiles various sancta,
especially the sanctuary,

00:30:25.904 --> 00:30:29.829
but also God's name and also
the Holy Land itself.

00:30:29.829 --> 00:30:33.630
Moral impurity differs from
ritual impurity not simply

00:30:33.630 --> 00:30:37.862
because of its origin in sin,
but also in the fact that it's

00:30:37.862 --> 00:30:39.869
not contagious,
alright?

00:30:39.869 --> 00:30:43.939
You don't contract impurity by
touching a murderer,

00:30:43.939 --> 00:30:48.171
the way that you contract
ritual impurity by touching

00:30:48.171 --> 00:30:50.450
somebody with gonorrhea.
 

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.589
Also, moral impurity is not
removed or reducible through

00:30:53.589 --> 00:30:56.899
rituals, through washings and
launderings, ritual ablutions

00:30:56.899 --> 00:31:00.008
and the like.
That does not touch moral

00:31:00.008 --> 00:31:01.890
impurity in a person.
 

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:06.913
Moral purity of persons can be
achieved only by punishment for

00:31:06.913 --> 00:31:09.220
heinous sins:
for example,

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:10.833
the punishment of
chirate,

00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:13.153
or cutting off,
is a divine punishment of being

00:31:13.153 --> 00:31:15.170
extirpated from the House of
Israel;

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:19.163
death, alright,
that's one way to be rid of

00:31:19.163 --> 00:31:22.754
moral impurity.
Also it can be achieved by

00:31:22.754 --> 00:31:26.020
simply avoiding or abstaining
from defiling,

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:30.045
immoral acts in the first
place: that's another way to

00:31:30.045 --> 00:31:32.019
achieve moral purity.
 

00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:36.226
Also, if you atone for
unwitting sins that you perhaps

00:31:36.226 --> 00:31:40.358
later realize and regret;
acknowledge and confess,

00:31:40.358 --> 00:31:44.500
then that can also have a
reduced moral impurity.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.326
Very severe moral impurity
defiles the innermost areas of

00:31:49.326 --> 00:31:52.430
the sanctuary as well as the
land.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:54.906
Now, the sanctuary can be
purified of moral impurity,

00:31:54.906 --> 00:31:57.430
and I'll come back and talk
about that in a second;

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.099
but the land really cannot.
 

00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:03.527
Land that is repeatedly
defiled, or the holy land of God

00:32:03.527 --> 00:32:06.706
that is repeatedly defiled by
sexual transgressions,

00:32:06.706 --> 00:32:08.950
for example,
cannot be purified.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.154
Eventually it will simply
"vomit out," the biblical text

00:32:12.154 --> 00:32:15.360
says, it will simply vomit out
those who dwell on it.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.119
This is a reference to exile.
 

00:32:17.119 --> 00:32:20.661
This is consistent with the
representation of the expulsion

00:32:20.661 --> 00:32:22.859
of the Canaanites from God's
land.

00:32:22.859 --> 00:32:25.702
Remember when God said,
"The sin of the Amorites is not

00:32:25.702 --> 00:32:27.913
yet complete,
when they have sinned so much

00:32:27.913 --> 00:32:30.813
and to such a degree,
they will be vomited out and

00:32:30.813 --> 00:32:32.509
then your tenancy can begin"?
 

00:32:32.509 --> 00:32:35.781
The land will purge itself of
the impurity by vomiting them

00:32:35.781 --> 00:32:37.533
out.
And this is consistent then

00:32:37.533 --> 00:32:40.674
with the repeated warnings in
Leviticus to the Israelites not

00:32:40.674 --> 00:32:43.972
to engage in similar abominable
and sinful practices--the sexual

00:32:43.972 --> 00:32:45.859
transgressions,
the bloodshed,

00:32:45.859 --> 00:32:49.460
the idolatry--because they too
will pollute the land until it

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.980
vomits them out.
They will be expelled.

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:56.059
The land is also defiled by
illicit homicide.

00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:58.616
There is legal homicide,
of course, judicial death and

00:32:58.616 --> 00:33:00.690
so on in the Bible,
but illicit homicide,

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.199
whether intentional or
unintentional,

00:33:03.199 --> 00:33:05.430
murder or accidental homicide.
 

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:08.778
The manslayer bears blood
guilt, what is referred to as

00:33:08.778 --> 00:33:11.099
"blood guilt."
That's a kind of moral

00:33:11.099 --> 00:33:14.180
impurity, and his life is
forfeit because of that.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:18.214
In cases of deliberate murder,
blood guilt and impurity are

00:33:18.214 --> 00:33:21.623
removed only by the death of the
murderer himself:

00:33:21.623 --> 00:33:23.849
only blood atones for blood.
 

00:33:23.849 --> 00:33:27.717
In cases of accidental
homicide, the perpetrator can

00:33:27.717 --> 00:33:31.963
take refuge in one of five
cities that are designated for

00:33:31.963 --> 00:33:35.299
this purpose:
the five cities of refuge.

00:33:35.299 --> 00:33:38.599
They can live there until the
death of the high priest,

00:33:38.599 --> 00:33:41.898
and the death of the high
priest symbolically serves to

00:33:41.898 --> 00:33:45.563
purge or remove the blood guilt
or impurity of the accidental

00:33:45.563 --> 00:33:48.930
homicide.
Idolatry also defiles the land.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:52.019
Offenders are subject to
stoning and the divine penalty

00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:54.079
of chirate,
of cutting off.

00:33:54.079 --> 00:33:57.076
The Bible repeatedly warns that
idols and their cultic

00:33:57.076 --> 00:34:00.524
appurtenances must be completely
destroyed from the Holy Land,

00:34:00.524 --> 00:34:02.220
right?
The Israelites have to

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.480
eradicate that,
they're polluting the land.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:07.973
Now, in contrast to the land,
God's sanctuary can be purified

00:34:07.973 --> 00:34:11.059
for moral impurity by means of a
special sacrifice.

00:34:11.059 --> 00:34:13.932
And this is the fourth
sacrifice listed here,

00:34:13.932 --> 00:34:16.805
the hatta't,
which is the purification

00:34:16.805 --> 00:34:19.092
sacrifice.
It's often erroneously

00:34:19.092 --> 00:34:21.090
translated as a "sin offering."
 

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:24.400
It's better translated as a
purification offering.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.210
How does it operate?
 

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.306
The blood of the animal,
the blood of the sacrifice is

00:34:29.306 --> 00:34:31.059
the key to the whole ritual.
 

00:34:31.059 --> 00:34:34.679
Remember that impurity and sin
are often associated with death.

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:38.489
Holiness, that which is holy,
is often associated with life.

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:40.280
And if the two are antithetical
then it makes sense.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.732
If impurity is associated with
death, it makes sense that its

00:34:43.732 --> 00:34:46.840
antithesis, holiness,
would be associated with life.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.548
According to the Priestly
source, blood,

00:34:49.548 --> 00:34:53.855
the blood that courses through
one's veins, represents the life

00:34:53.855 --> 00:34:55.943
force.
Remember in the Noahide

00:34:55.943 --> 00:34:59.032
covenant, in Genesis 9,
which is a Priestly passage,

00:34:59.032 --> 00:35:02.969
the Priestly blood prohibition:
You may not spill human blood.

00:35:02.969 --> 00:35:06.167
And you may not eat animal
flesh that has the lifeblood in

00:35:06.167 --> 00:35:09.309
it because the blood is the life
and that belongs to God,

00:35:09.309 --> 00:35:10.599
that's holy,
right?

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:13.269
So the life force is holy and
the life force is in the blood.

00:35:13.269 --> 00:35:16.175
Leviticus 17:11 says this;
it repeats the blood

00:35:16.175 --> 00:35:19.079
prohibition, and then it offers
a rationale.

00:35:19.079 --> 00:35:21.739
"For the life of the flesh is
in the blood,

00:35:21.739 --> 00:35:25.413
and I have assigned it to you
for making expiation for your

00:35:25.413 --> 00:35:27.059
lives upon the altar."
 

00:35:27.059 --> 00:35:30.119
I've assigned it to you to use
in sacrificial practices.

00:35:30.119 --> 00:35:33.688
It is the blood as life that
effects expiation,

00:35:33.688 --> 00:35:35.550
purging and atonement.
 

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:39.342
So the Priestly texts couldn't
be clearer: blood represents

00:35:39.342 --> 00:35:40.994
life.
The blood of sacrificial

00:35:40.994 --> 00:35:43.780
animals is assigned by God as a
detergent, if you will,

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.800
to cleanse the sanctuary of the
impurities that are caused by

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.280
the sinful deeds of the
Israelites.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.559
Sacrifices that purge the
sanctuary of ritual impurity,

00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:56.665
primarily the hatta't,
 always involve the

00:35:56.665 --> 00:36:00.361
manipulation of the animal's
blood, daubing it on the altar

00:36:00.361 --> 00:36:03.501
and on Yom Kippur,
actually entering the innermost

00:36:03.501 --> 00:36:07.163
shrine and sprinkling it on the
throne of God and the footstool,

00:36:07.163 --> 00:36:10.480
the ark itself.
It symbolizes the victory of

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.292
the forces of life,
oath and holiness over death

00:36:14.292 --> 00:36:17.054
and impurity.
Other purifactory rights that

00:36:17.054 --> 00:36:19.882
are listed in the Bible will
sometimes involve the use of

00:36:19.882 --> 00:36:22.610
reddish substances as a kind of
surrogate of blood.

00:36:22.610 --> 00:36:27.448
It's a widely--it is widely and
mistakenly thought that the

00:36:27.448 --> 00:36:32.120
purification offering purifies
the sinner or the impurity

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.290
bearer or the offerer.
 

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:36.190
This can't be true.
 

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:38.625
The hatta't,
the purification offering,

00:36:38.625 --> 00:36:42.090
doesn't rid a ritually impure
person of their ritual impurity.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:44.368
You can't even offer a
sacrifice unless you're already

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:46.217
ritually pure,
because you couldn't get into

00:36:46.217 --> 00:36:48.410
the sanctuary to offer your
sacrifice if you weren't

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.900
ritually pure.
You can't approach to offer a

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:54.329
sacrifice if you're not in a
state of ritual purity already.

00:36:54.329 --> 00:36:58.472
So purification offerings are
brought after the genital

00:36:58.472 --> 00:37:02.788
discharge has healed and passed;
after the scale disease has

00:37:02.788 --> 00:37:05.453
healed and passed;
after the appropriate ablutions

00:37:05.453 --> 00:37:08.050
have been observed and the
person is essentially pure.

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:10.572
But there's one more step they
have to take before they're

00:37:10.572 --> 00:37:12.210
integrated back into the
community.

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:15.102
The hatta't also does
not rid a sinner of their moral

00:37:15.102 --> 00:37:18.093
impurity, because the offering
is brought after the sinner has

00:37:18.093 --> 00:37:20.809
confessed,
after the sinner has repented.

00:37:20.809 --> 00:37:23.242
The purification offering acts
on the sanctuary,

00:37:23.242 --> 00:37:24.329
not on the offerer.
 

00:37:24.329 --> 00:37:27.651
It purges the sanctuary of the
defilement that is

00:37:27.651 --> 00:37:31.112
symbolically--it has
symbolically suffered from the

00:37:31.112 --> 00:37:34.780
offerer's state of ritual
impurity or sinfulness.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.230
Once the sanctuary is purged,
the offerer has settled his

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:40.880
debt, he's repaired the damage
he caused.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:44.949
He's fully atoned,
"at one" again with God.

00:37:44.949 --> 00:37:49.316
And God is no longer repelled
by the impurity that marred his

00:37:49.316 --> 00:37:52.022
sanctuary.
The defiling effect of lesser

00:37:52.022 --> 00:37:55.939
transgressions is calibrated to
the sinner's intentionality and

00:37:55.939 --> 00:37:58.530
the presence or absence of
repentance.

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:02.580
So inadvertent sins can be
purged, the sanctuary defilement

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:06.422
that they cause can be purged by
bringing a purification

00:38:06.422 --> 00:38:09.130
sacrifice.
What about deliberate sins?

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.750
As long as there is repentance,
the biblical text says,

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:14.079
then they are converted into
inadvertent sins,

00:38:14.079 --> 00:38:17.733
and they also can be purged,
or the impurity they cause can

00:38:17.733 --> 00:38:20.380
be purged with a purification
sacrifice.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.729
But brazen, unrepentant sins,
unrepented sins,

00:38:23.729 --> 00:38:28.046
or unintentional sins that are
never realized…these stand

00:38:28.046 --> 00:38:31.469
unremedied, and they defile the
sanctuary.

00:38:31.469 --> 00:38:34.623
So for this reason,
the sanctuary has to be

00:38:34.623 --> 00:38:38.752
regularly purged of the
accumulated defilements accruing

00:38:38.752 --> 00:38:41.380
to it as a result of such sins.
 

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:45.606
Leviticus 16 describes the
annual ritual which is carried

00:38:45.606 --> 00:38:49.380
out on the day of atonement or
day of purgation,

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.615
it can be called,
Yom Kippur, when a

00:38:51.615 --> 00:38:54.937
hatta't sacrifice,
a purification sacrifice is

00:38:54.937 --> 00:38:57.940
brought on behalf of the
community to purify the

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:01.773
sanctuary of the impurities that
have been caused by Israel's

00:39:01.773 --> 00:39:04.136
sin.
And the high priest loads all

00:39:04.136 --> 00:39:07.439
of the sins and impurities of
the Israelites on the head of a

00:39:07.439 --> 00:39:09.695
goat,
which then carries them off

00:39:09.695 --> 00:39:12.719
into the wilderness away from
the sanctuary.

00:39:12.719 --> 00:39:15.402
Purification of the sanctuary
was believed to be critical to

00:39:15.402 --> 00:39:17.630
the health and the well-being of
the community.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:21.289
If the sanctuary is not purged
of impurity, it can become

00:39:21.289 --> 00:39:24.949
polluted to the point when God
is driven out entirely.

00:39:24.949 --> 00:39:28.139
Jacob Milgrom has argued that
there's a kind of Archimedean

00:39:28.139 --> 00:39:31.000
principle at work here:
every sin creates an impurity

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.135
that encroaches upon the realm
of holiness and displaces a

00:39:34.135 --> 00:39:35.949
certain amount of holiness.
 

00:39:35.949 --> 00:39:38.189
And eventually,
God will be completely

00:39:38.189 --> 00:39:41.761
displaced and the community will
be left in a godless state,

00:39:41.761 --> 00:39:43.880
without blessing or protection.
 

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.460
So Milgrom sees the symbolic
function of the purity system

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:51.230
this way: if the sanctuary
symbolizes the presence of God,

00:39:51.230 --> 00:39:55.468
and if impurity represents the
wrongdoing of persons,

00:39:55.468 --> 00:40:00.603
then by saying that impurity is
anathema to God and pollutes his

00:40:00.603 --> 00:40:02.903
temple,
the priests are able to

00:40:02.903 --> 00:40:06.381
graphically convey the idea that
sin forces God out of his

00:40:06.381 --> 00:40:08.699
sanctuary and out of the
community.

00:40:08.699 --> 00:40:13.188
Jacob Milgrom sees a moral
message at the base of this

00:40:13.188 --> 00:40:15.559
complex, symbolic picture.
 

00:40:15.559 --> 00:40:19.117
And that is that humans and
humans alone are responsible for

00:40:19.117 --> 00:40:22.977
the rein of wickedness and death
or the rein of righteousness and

00:40:22.977 --> 00:40:25.204
life.
Human actions determine the

00:40:25.204 --> 00:40:28.760
degree to which God can dwell on
earth among his people.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.461
So the goal or the objective of
the Priestly construction or

00:40:32.461 --> 00:40:35.409
representation of Israel's
impurity laws was,

00:40:35.409 --> 00:40:38.800
in Milgrom's view,
to sever impurity from the

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.347
demonic and to reinterpret it as
a symbolic system reminding

00:40:43.347 --> 00:40:47.199
Israel of the divine imperative
to reject sin,

00:40:47.199 --> 00:40:51.275
to behave in ways that attract
the presence of God and do not

00:40:51.275 --> 00:40:54.219
repel him.
You also read an article by

00:40:54.219 --> 00:40:58.636
Milgrom where Milgrom talks
about Priestly cultic imagery

00:40:58.636 --> 00:41:01.239
serving as a kind of theodicy.
 

00:41:01.239 --> 00:41:04.380
A theodicy of course is a
response to the problem of evil.

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.350
How can an all-powerful,
good God allow so much evil to

00:41:08.350 --> 00:41:10.630
exist and even go unpunished?
 

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.900
And according to Milgrom,
this is the priestly answer:

00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:16.059
every sin pollutes the
sanctuary.

00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:20.690
It may not mark the sinner,
but it does mark the sanctuary.

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:22.690
It scars the face of the
sanctuary.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.023
You may think you've gotten
away with something,

00:41:25.023 --> 00:41:26.960
but every act of social
exploitation,

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:31.002
every act of moral corruption,
pollutes the sanctuary more and

00:41:31.002 --> 00:41:34.912
more until such time as God is
driven out entirely and human

00:41:34.912 --> 00:41:39.219
society is devoured by its own
viciousness and death-dealing.

00:41:39.219 --> 00:41:42.684
So again, the ethical message
here is that humans are in

00:41:42.684 --> 00:41:46.338
control of their destiny and the
action of every individual

00:41:46.338 --> 00:41:49.300
affects and influences the fate
of society.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.636
This is really the Priestly
version of an old biblical

00:41:52.636 --> 00:41:55.909
doctrine, a doctrine of
collective responsibility.

00:41:55.909 --> 00:41:59.999
Sin affects…individual sin
affects the entire fabric of

00:41:59.999 --> 00:42:02.060
society.
There's no such thing as an

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.809
isolated evil;
our deeds affect one another.

00:42:04.809 --> 00:42:08.278
And when evildoers are finally
punished, they bring down others

00:42:08.278 --> 00:42:09.505
with them.
Those others,

00:42:09.505 --> 00:42:11.299
however, aren't so blameless,
Milgrom says,

00:42:11.299 --> 00:42:13.862
because they allowed the wicked
to flourish and contribute to

00:42:13.862 --> 00:42:17.219
the pollution of the sanctuary,
the corruption of society.

00:42:17.219 --> 00:42:20.944
So P's cultic imagery is
informed, according to Milgrom,

00:42:20.944 --> 00:42:25.142
by the same communal ethic that
we will see running through the

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.805
Bible,
much of the Bible,

00:42:26.805 --> 00:42:28.010
until a later period.
 

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:31.239
It's simply conveying that
ethic in its own modality

00:42:31.239 --> 00:42:34.659
through the symbolism of the
sanctuary and the cult.

00:42:34.659 --> 00:42:38.070
The 11th chapter of Leviticus
deals with the dietary laws.

00:42:38.070 --> 00:42:40.420
We don't have time to go into
them at any great length.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:43.784
I will say that Milgrom has
also argued that the dietary

00:42:43.784 --> 00:42:47.393
laws of Leviticus are similarly
part of a symbol system that

00:42:47.393 --> 00:42:49.289
emphasizes life over death.
 

00:42:49.289 --> 00:42:52.639
This is the following evidence
that he cites;

00:42:52.639 --> 00:42:56.335
the mainstays of the dietary
laws are these:

00:42:56.335 --> 00:43:01.663
first, the prohibition against
eating animal blood from Genesis

00:43:01.663 --> 00:43:04.500
9, which symbolizes the life.
 

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:08.502
We also, in Leviticus 11,
meat dietary laws that are

00:43:08.502 --> 00:43:13.760
governed by criteria such as cud
chewing and having a split hoof;

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:17.150
you can only eat animals that
chew the cud and have a split

00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:18.860
hoof.
And those criteria seem

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.462
arbitrary and meaningless in and
of themselves,

00:43:21.462 --> 00:43:22.820
and he says they are.
 

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.884
But look at their practical
effect: that limits the number

00:43:25.884 --> 00:43:29.324
of animals that one can eat to a
mere handful out of the hundreds

00:43:29.324 --> 00:43:31.690
upon hundreds of creatures on
the earth,

00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:34.988
that basically leaves you
with--my animal husbandry is not

00:43:34.988 --> 00:43:38.286
good here--but it leaves you
with the bovine and the ovine

00:43:38.286 --> 00:43:41.932
classes--I guess ovine are goats
and some such--so it leaves you

00:43:41.932 --> 00:43:44.710
basically with goats and sheep
and cattle.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:50.107
Some have hypothesized that
whatever the origin of various

00:43:50.107 --> 00:43:54.368
food taboos in Israel,
the Priestly texts have tried

00:43:54.368 --> 00:43:58.550
to create a dietary discipline
that drives home the point that

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:01.909
all life shared also by animals
is inviolable,

00:44:01.909 --> 00:44:05.087
except in the case of meat,
which has been conceded by God,

00:44:05.087 --> 00:44:08.210
and provided that the animals
are slaughtered properly,

00:44:08.210 --> 00:44:11.643
painlessly, and that their
blood, which is symbolic of the

00:44:11.643 --> 00:44:14.354
life, is not appropriated but
returned to God,

00:44:14.354 --> 00:44:15.679
its sacred source.
 

00:44:15.679 --> 00:44:18.827
So perhaps as it stands,
the system of dietary laws does

00:44:18.827 --> 00:44:21.059
in fact emphasize reverence for
life.

00:44:21.059 --> 00:44:24.355
But they also serve another
very important function,

00:44:24.355 --> 00:44:28.296
and that was the formation and
maintenance of a differentiated

00:44:28.296 --> 00:44:31.139
ethnic identity or in Priestly
parlance,

00:44:31.139 --> 00:44:34.420
the formation and maintenance
of a holy peoples separated out

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:37.699
from other nations by rules that
mark her as God's people.

00:44:37.699 --> 00:44:42.398
It's surely significant that
the dietary laws are followed by

00:44:42.398 --> 00:44:46.548
a powerful exhortation to be
holy in imitation of God,

00:44:46.548 --> 00:44:48.349
Leviticus 11:43-45.
 

00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:51.474
So we've just had the
prohibition of not eating

00:44:51.474 --> 00:44:55.412
certain kinds of small animals,
designated as anything that

00:44:55.412 --> 00:44:56.820
swarms.
And the text says,

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.189
You shall not draw
abomination upon yourselves

00:44:59.189 --> 00:45:01.906
through anything that swarms;
you shall not make yourselves

00:45:01.906 --> 00:45:03.800
unclean therewith and thus
become unclean.

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:06.711
For I the Lord am your God:
you shall sanctify yourselves

00:45:06.711 --> 00:45:08.219
and be holy, for I am holy.
 

00:45:08.219 --> 00:45:10.500
You shall not make yourselves
unclean through any swarming

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.860
thing that moves upon the earth.
 

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.460
For I the Lord am He who
brought you up from the land of

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.305
Egypt to be your God:
you shall be holy,

00:45:16.305 --> 00:45:18.260
for I am holy.
Look at how much this is

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.335
emphasized.
The dietary laws are presented

00:45:20.335 --> 00:45:23.887
by the priests not as a hygienic
regimen--who knows if that's how

00:45:23.887 --> 00:45:27.217
they started--not as a sensible
way to avoid various diseases

00:45:27.217 --> 00:45:30.769
that are caused by the lack of
refrigeration in the desert.

00:45:30.769 --> 00:45:34.216
Whatever the actual origin of
these various dietary taboos,

00:45:34.216 --> 00:45:37.485
they are here embedded in a
larger ideological framework

00:45:37.485 --> 00:45:40.396
concerning the need for the
Israelites to separate

00:45:40.396 --> 00:45:43.190
themselves and to be holy like
their god.

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:46.038
The dietary laws are connected
then with this theme of

00:45:46.038 --> 00:45:48.349
imitatio dei,
of imitation of God.

00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:50.964
As God is holy,
separate and distinct,

00:45:50.964 --> 00:45:52.590
so you shall be holy.
 

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.878
I just want to take two last
minutes to quickly point to this

00:45:56.878 --> 00:46:01.237
theme of holiness that continues
in the section referred to as

00:46:01.237 --> 00:46:02.809
the Holiness Code.
 

00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:05.823
This theme, and the
exhortation, "you shall be holy,

00:46:05.823 --> 00:46:09.132
for I the Lord your God am
holy," they find their fullest

00:46:09.132 --> 00:46:13.411
expression in the block of text;
Leviticus 17 through 26 that's

00:46:13.411 --> 00:46:15.849
referred to as the Holiness
Code.

00:46:15.849 --> 00:46:19.481
There's an important difference
between Leviticus 1 through 16

00:46:19.481 --> 00:46:20.909
and the Holiness Code.
 

00:46:20.909 --> 00:46:23.934
According to Leviticus 1
through 16, Israel's priests are

00:46:23.934 --> 00:46:26.579
designated as holy:
a holy class within Israel,

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:29.215
singled out,
dedicated to the service of God

00:46:29.215 --> 00:46:32.280
and demarcated by rules that
apply only to them.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:36.570
Israelites may aspire to
holiness, but it's not assumed.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:40.481
However, in the Holiness Code,
we have texts that come closer

00:46:40.481 --> 00:46:44.328
to the idea that Israel itself
is holy by virtue of the fact

00:46:44.328 --> 00:46:48.369
that God has set Israel apart
from the nations to himself,

00:46:48.369 --> 00:46:51.268
to belong to him,
just as he set apart the

00:46:51.268 --> 00:46:54.380
seventh day to himself to belong
with him.

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:58.294
Holy things only exist because
of safeguards,

00:46:58.294 --> 00:47:03.010
rules that keep them separate,
that demarcate them.

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:06.860
And these safeguards and rules
are naturally addressed to human

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.102
beings.
They are the ones charged with

00:47:09.102 --> 00:47:12.409
the task of preserving the holy
in its residence on earth.

00:47:12.409 --> 00:47:15.994
So although holiness derives
from god, humans have a crucial

00:47:15.994 --> 00:47:19.579
role to play in sanctification,
in sanctifying the world.

00:47:19.579 --> 00:47:21.449
That's illustrated in the case
of the Sabbath.

00:47:21.449 --> 00:47:23.800
God sanctified the Sabbath at
creation;

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.400
he demarcated it as holy.
 

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:29.025
But Israel is the one to affirm
its holiness by observing the

00:47:29.025 --> 00:47:32.469
rules that make it different,
that mark it off as holy.

00:47:32.469 --> 00:47:35.689
So Israel doesn't just in fact
affirm the holy status of the

00:47:35.689 --> 00:47:38.800
Sabbath, they actualize the holy
status of the Sabbath.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.382
If Israel doesn't observe the
prohibitions that distinguish

00:47:42.382 --> 00:47:45.780
the Sabbath as sacred,
it's automatically desecrated.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.289
"You shall keep the Sabbath,
for it is holy for you.

00:47:48.289 --> 00:47:50.320
He who profanes it shall be put
to death.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:52.885
Whoever does work on it,
that person is cut off from

00:47:52.885 --> 00:47:54.611
among his kin."
You automatically,

00:47:54.611 --> 00:47:57.273
it is automatically desecrated
and profaned if you don't

00:47:57.273 --> 00:47:58.289
observe its rules.
 

00:47:58.289 --> 00:48:02.024
So there are two components
integral and inseparable in the

00:48:02.024 --> 00:48:04.985
concept of holiness:
initial assignment of holy

00:48:04.985 --> 00:48:08.913
status by God and establishment
of rules to preserve that holy

00:48:08.913 --> 00:48:10.502
status,
and secondly,

00:48:10.502 --> 00:48:14.090
actualization of that holiness
by humans through the observance

00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:17.331
of the commandments and rules
that mark that thing off as

00:48:17.331 --> 00:48:19.482
holy.
That's going to lead us very

00:48:19.482 --> 00:48:22.963
nicely into an understanding of
the laws that mark off Israel's

00:48:22.963 --> 00:48:25.940
status and keep Israel distinct
among the nations,

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.480
which we'll be looking at on
Wednesday.

00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:30.227
So please take a look at the
materials that were sent out:

00:48:30.227 --> 00:48:32.637
the Ancient Near Eastern
collection and some of the

00:48:32.637 --> 00:48:35.000
questions to guide you through
this material.

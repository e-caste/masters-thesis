00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.180
Prof: As we approach the
end of the semester we also,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.630
naturally, approach the end of
the Quixote,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.482
and we move on to the
consideration of other works of

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:19.119
his,
as well as reactions to his

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:25.110
works by two major writers,
Kafka and Borges.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.740
That will be next Thursday.
 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.560
Today, I will talk about the
end of the great novel,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.020
and next class I will devote to
those other works,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.140
and also to Cervantes' death,
but before,

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.126
I want to address two topics
that have sort of fallen by the

00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:52.728
way side;
humor and Cervantes' self

00:00:52.728 --> 00:00:59.358
portraits, following my little
essay in the Casebook

00:00:59.358 --> 00:01:03.359
that you have--presumably--read.
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.545
Other than slapstick,
or the slapstick kind of humor

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:15.730
that we find occasionally in
the Quixote,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.739
in the episodes at the inn in
Part I,

00:01:19.739 --> 00:01:22.649
for instance,
as well as some of the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.965
scatological instances,
such as the time when Sancho

00:01:26.965 --> 00:01:30.200
defecates in the fulling hammers
episode.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.819
Cervantes' humor is broader,
more encompassing,

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.239
sophisticated,
and it is laced with irony.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:44.521
By irony I mean that there is a
benign detachment,

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:50.772
a discreet perspective from
which humanity is being seen in

00:01:50.772 --> 00:01:53.900
contrast to the mad hero.
 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.051
Don Quixote's madness allows
the narrator and the reader to

00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:04.750
appreciate everyone's folly.
 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.250
No one is safe.
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.825
Not the priest,
the duke, graduates like

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:16.229
Sansón Carrasco,
and not even the narrator

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:17.330
himself.
 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.204
Sancho's wisdom is another
measure by which to judge other

00:02:23.204 --> 00:02:27.430
characters, presumably better
educated.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.538
He is not just the wise fool,
funny,

00:02:31.538 --> 00:02:36.758
the funny man who stumbles upon
truths by chance,

00:02:36.758 --> 00:02:40.460
but the possessor of natural
reason,

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.530
which allows him to be right
when others,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.318
who are well-read, are wrong.
 

00:02:46.318 --> 00:02:52.043
I believe that the one who best
encapsulated Cervantes' humor

00:02:52.043 --> 00:02:57.194
was the late Lowry Nelson,
who was a professor for many

00:02:57.194 --> 00:02:59.580
years, here, at Yale.
 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.414
He writes in his Cervantes,
A Collection of Critical

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:05.627
Essays,
in the introduction he writes

00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:08.906
the following,
and you have a handout in which

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:12.270
to follow my reading of this
quotation.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.628
It's the one-signed Lowry
Nelson, Jr.:

00:03:16.628 --> 00:03:21.060
"As depicters of the human
condition,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.478
both Shakespeare and Cervantes
belong to the select company of

00:03:26.478 --> 00:03:30.120
those I would call universal
ironists,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.610
as distinct from tendentious
ironists.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.276
Universal ironists contemplate
the world with a kind of gentle

00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:44.483
resignation and compassion in
full knowledge of both the

00:03:44.483 --> 00:03:47.620
grandeurs and miseries of human
life.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.309
Among them I would number
Chaucer, Chekhov,

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:54.120
Kafka and Svevo [Italo Svevo].
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.883
Tendentious ironists view the
world from a programmatic

00:03:59.883 --> 00:04:05.967
stance, connoting accusation,
bitter protest and meliorist

00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:09.169
reformation of human ills.
 

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.250
[Meliorist, meaning to make
better].

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.747
Among them I would include
Flaubert, Ibsen,

00:04:15.747 --> 00:04:17.569
Hardy and Mann.
 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.132
The distinction is only
approximate but nonetheless

00:04:20.132 --> 00:04:20.850
significant.
 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.988
Neither attitude is
qualitatively superior or

00:04:24.988 --> 00:04:27.899
justifiable,
though it is perhaps the

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:31.648
universal ironist who can view
mankind with greater tolerance

00:04:31.648 --> 00:04:32.959
and understanding.
 

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:37.365
It is he who can encompass a
broader span of human types and

00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:38.860
human experiences.
 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.851
It is he who can best present
the inviolability and unique

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:47.970
essence of the particular and
the individual.

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:53.035
It is precisely this ability in
Shakespeare and Cervantes to

00:04:53.035 --> 00:04:57.069
create particularized essence
that leads us,

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.725
their readers,
to draw the general conclusion

00:04:59.725 --> 00:05:02.259
to see the individual as
representative.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:08.636
Hence, the seeming plenitude of
humanity we find in such odd and

00:05:08.636 --> 00:05:13.899
peculiar figures as Don Quixote
and Sancho Panza,

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:16.399
not to mention Sansón
Carrasco,

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.910
the curate, Marcela,
Ginés de Pasamonte,

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.810
and others."
 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.574
Particularized essence means
here, I think,

00:05:27.574 --> 00:05:31.966
that individual objects,
and specially characters,

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:36.180
are full within themselves,
in their being;

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.180
they're round.
 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.110
This is why details are so
important in the Quixote.

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.028
By the plenitude of humanity
Nelson means the foibles,

00:05:47.028 --> 00:05:50.651
weaknesses and also the
grandeur of these figures,

00:05:50.651 --> 00:05:52.937
as he says;
their mistakes,

00:05:52.937 --> 00:05:57.413
their bumps against the real
are funny, and counterbalance

00:05:57.413 --> 00:05:58.750
their virtues.
 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.494
Irony resides in the fulcrum,
where the two are added to each

00:06:03.494 --> 00:06:06.500
other, without canceling each
other.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.661
With respect to Shakespeare,
though, though I agree with

00:06:10.661 --> 00:06:15.730
Nelson, I want to reiterate what
I have said in previous classes.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:24.132
There is a level of despair in
his plays that is never reached

00:06:24.132 --> 00:06:26.199
in Cervantes.
 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.778
Cervantes has a gentler
perspective on the human

00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:34.480
condition and a more optimistic
one.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.480
I'm thinking,
of course, of Hamlet.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.899
And I'm thinking,
of course, of King Lear.

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:45.870
So much for humor,
although much more could and

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.060
should have been said throughout
the semester.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:07:00.028
Now, as for the self portraits,
I included those texts because,

00:07:00.028 --> 00:07:03.504
as I explained in the book,
the format of the

00:07:03.504 --> 00:07:08.004
Casebook called for an
interview with the author in

00:07:08.004 --> 00:07:12.005
question,
and since Cervantes was not

00:07:12.005 --> 00:07:18.014
available I thought that it
would be best to include this

00:07:18.014 --> 00:07:20.389
text,
that would make a good

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:21.160
substitute.
 

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.742
I toyed with the idea of
inventing an interview with

00:07:25.742 --> 00:07:28.987
Cervantes,
but I didn't think I could get

00:07:28.987 --> 00:07:32.795
it past the editors at the very
staid and serious Oxford

00:07:32.795 --> 00:07:34.180
University Press.
 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.949
The things I would like you to
remember from my little prologue

00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:45.067
are these: that individualism
lead to portraiture in the

00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:49.512
Renaissance,
and also individualism that was

00:07:49.512 --> 00:07:54.041
also aided and helped by wealth;
that perspective,

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:56.920
the development of
perspective--

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.785
think of Alberti,
of whom I have mentioned many

00:07:59.785 --> 00:08:04.346
times along the semester--
allowed for more realistic

00:08:04.346 --> 00:08:10.706
particularized kind of portrait,
showing significant details of

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:13.725
the face and body,
not all necessarily

00:08:13.725 --> 00:08:17.552
flattering--although,
of course, those who paid for

00:08:17.552 --> 00:08:20.610
the portraits wanted to be
flattered;

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:25.750
that the first self portrait by
a painting that we know of was

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.841
Albrecht Dürer,
in which he shows his piercing

00:08:30.841 --> 00:08:36.558
eyes and fine hand,
the instrument of his craft;

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:40.806
and that this self portrait
announces and anticipates is

00:08:40.806 --> 00:08:44.126
better the one of
Velázquez in Las

00:08:44.126 --> 00:08:47.447
Meninas,
where he appears in a prominent

00:08:47.447 --> 00:08:50.508
position,
full of energy and self

00:08:50.508 --> 00:08:53.980
assurance in the act of
painting.

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:59.633
Then there are the concomitant
self portraits by Cervantes,

00:08:59.633 --> 00:09:04.408
which are characteristically
self depreciating.

00:09:04.408 --> 00:09:11.240
In one he talks about the
changing color of his hair;

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.269
in another, he talks about his
missing teeth and so forth;

00:09:16.269 --> 00:09:21.277
so he's self deprecating,
particularly with regards to

00:09:21.277 --> 00:09:24.490
the effects of time on his body.
 

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:30.847
What I would add today is that
we should see those self

00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:36.852
portraits in relation to the
1605 prologue to the

00:09:36.852 --> 00:09:43.798
Quixote and Cervantes' self
presentation as author.

00:09:43.798 --> 00:09:48.350
It is certainly different from
Velázquez,

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.950
whose much more self assured
and self promoting obviously,

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:59.447
but perhaps this is the effect
of the different mediums that

00:09:59.447 --> 00:10:02.806
they are using,
painting and literature,

00:10:02.806 --> 00:10:05.215
but most likely it is a
difference in their

00:10:05.215 --> 00:10:06.190
personalities.
 

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:13.200
Now, we get to Don Quixote's
return home.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.921
The novel's plot with his
repeated returns home suggests

00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:23.808
that life consists of going and
coming back,

00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:28.561
sort of a compressed
Iliad and Odyssey

00:10:28.561 --> 00:10:31.184
together,
and is made up of a series of

00:10:31.184 --> 00:10:35.808
apparent repetitions,
re-encounters and reprise.

00:10:35.808 --> 00:10:42.820
Both parts end with the return
home after a sally;

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.820
actually, there are three
returns.

00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.730
It seems as if Don
Quixote, the whole novel,

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.974
is suggesting that in fiction
there are two basic plots:

00:10:53.974 --> 00:10:57.370
one going out and the other one
come back;

00:10:57.370 --> 00:11:00.558
one the Iliad and the
other one the Odyssey.

00:11:00.558 --> 00:11:04.201
That's too simplistic,
but there seems to be that

00:11:04.201 --> 00:11:08.830
suggestion in the combined two
parts of the Quixote.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:12.750
What do these repetitions
reveal?

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.178
What do we learn from them?
 

00:11:16.178 --> 00:11:19.220
Perhaps that to live is to live
again,

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:24.298
and that life includes the
remembrance of life,

00:11:24.298 --> 00:11:28.841
as Proust would discover and
exploit over two centuries later

00:11:28.841 --> 00:11:32.703
in his great novel À
la recherche du temps

00:11:32.703 --> 00:11:35.859
perdu,
Remembrance of Things

00:11:35.859 --> 00:11:39.605
Past, in English;
a great work that I hope you

00:11:39.605 --> 00:11:43.259
have the chance to read some
day, if you haven't yet.

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:49.418
That is why we approach the end
by returning to the beginning.

00:11:49.418 --> 00:11:52.352
In the process,
Cervantes has,

00:11:52.352 --> 00:11:56.030
once again,
underlined that reality has

00:11:56.030 --> 00:12:02.110
become fictionalized in Part II,
independent of Don Quixote,

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:08.932
and that his own hero belongs
to the great fictions of the

00:12:08.932 --> 00:12:12.585
ages,
to the great characters of the

00:12:12.585 --> 00:12:13.100
ages.
 

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:18.647
I have been mentioning this,
and I will repeat it now when I

00:12:18.647 --> 00:12:21.278
comment upon some passage.
 

00:12:21.278 --> 00:12:25.000
Cervantes also,
in this return--and I will go

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.474
over it--
underscores the nature of the

00:12:28.474 --> 00:12:34.402
Don Quixote's victory,
which I mentioned with regards

00:12:34.402 --> 00:12:38.480
to Aeneas in the Aeneid.
 

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.349
So, as he returns,
Don Quixote finds a character

00:12:42.349 --> 00:12:45.148
from the apocryphal
Quixote,

00:12:45.148 --> 00:12:47.700
Don Álvaro de Tarfe.
 

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.436
I have read Avellaneda's
Quixote,

00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:54.296
and I can assure you that this
character appears in that

00:12:54.296 --> 00:12:55.629
Quixote.
 

00:12:55.629 --> 00:13:00.255
It is as if his memories had a
life outside of himself in

00:13:00.255 --> 00:13:01.330
literature.
 

00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:04.945
Cervantes is,
of course, again,

00:13:04.945 --> 00:13:10.317
poking fun at Avellaneda,
but the way he does is full of

00:13:10.317 --> 00:13:13.330
other suggestions,
as I mentioned in a previous

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.703
class,
and I referred to the work by

00:13:15.703 --> 00:13:16.750
Stephen Gilman.
 

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:22.202
The first and clearest is that
Don Quixote lives in a world of

00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:27.120
fiction that intersects that of
Avellaneda's fiction.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:33.360
It is the ultimate proof that,
in this Part II,

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.782
reality has become
fictionalized,

00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:38.830
as I mentioned earlier,
without the help of Don

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:40.865
Quixote's fantasy,
it is out there,

00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:42.440
already fictionalized.
 

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.470
Characters from two different
fictional books meet,

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:49.769
and one asks the other to sign
a document,

00:13:49.769 --> 00:13:55.081
a notarized document to testify
that the book in which he

00:13:55.081 --> 00:13:59.730
appeared was false and that he
is the real one.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:03.620
This is enormously funny at a
very sophisticated level.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:10.131
The document is crucial,
as legality would be the

00:14:10.131 --> 00:14:17.460
ultimate way of guaranteeing
that a fiction is real.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.586
Cervantes is perhaps
remembering here the legal

00:14:22.586 --> 00:14:28.158
document out of which picaresque
fiction issued.

00:14:28.158 --> 00:14:30.649
Remember that I mentioned
several times,

00:14:30.649 --> 00:14:34.240
the picaresque begins as a
deposition,

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.649
a legal document of a criminal
addressing a judge,

00:14:38.649 --> 00:14:44.899
and so this is not the end of
Avellaneda,

00:14:44.899 --> 00:14:48.400
because, as you remember,
after Don Quixote regains his

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.356
sanity,
he asks to be forgiven by

00:14:51.356 --> 00:14:54.678
Avellaneda for having induced
him,

00:14:54.678 --> 00:14:57.158
enticed him to write such a bad
book.

00:14:57.158 --> 00:15:02.533
So then they come to the last
inn, remember we talked about

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:06.980
the first inn,
and now we get to the last inn.

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.437
The first inn in Part I,
remember, with the prostitutes,

00:15:10.437 --> 00:15:13.206
and the fish that is served,
and all of that,

00:15:13.206 --> 00:15:15.028
where he's made a knight.
 

00:15:15.028 --> 00:15:19.995
Here we get to the last inn
which he does not confuse with a

00:15:19.995 --> 00:15:21.509
castle any more.
 

00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:24.837
At the last inn,
where Don Quixote and Sancho

00:15:24.837 --> 00:15:29.149
lodge on the way back their
room, contains representations

00:15:29.149 --> 00:15:31.418
of Helen of Troy and Dido.
 

00:15:31.418 --> 00:15:35.868
The passage,
I believe, is one more example

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:42.330
of Cervantes' awareness of the
importance of his creations.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:50.096
This is on pages 927,928 in the
Jarvis translation and it goes

00:15:50.096 --> 00:15:54.600
as follows:
"He was lodged in a ground

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.163
room [he, Don Quixote]
with painted serge [serge is a

00:15:59.163 --> 00:16:02.673
kind of base kind of cloth,
not very...],

00:16:02.673 --> 00:16:07.149
instead of tapestry,
as it is the fashion of country

00:16:07.149 --> 00:16:08.288
towns.
 

00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:12.096
In one of the pieces was
painted, by a wretched hand,

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:15.535
the Rape of Helen,
when the daring guest carried

00:16:15.535 --> 00:16:17.440
her off from Menelaus.
 

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.028
In another, was the history of
Dido and Aeneas;

00:16:21.028 --> 00:16:25.513
she upon a high tower,
as making signals with half a

00:16:25.513 --> 00:16:30.110
bed sheet to her fugitive guest,
who was out at sea,

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.908
flying away from her,
in a frigate or brigantine.

00:16:33.908 --> 00:16:36.912
He observed,
in the two history-pieces,

00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:40.230
that Helen went away with no
very ill will,

00:16:40.230 --> 00:16:43.548
for she was slyly laughing to
herself;

00:16:43.548 --> 00:16:49.721
but the beauteous Dido seemed
to let fall from her eyes tears

00:16:49.721 --> 00:16:51.779
as big as walnuts.
 

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:55.350
Which Don Quixote seeing,
he said,

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:59.162
â€˜These two ladies were
most unfortunate in not being

00:16:59.162 --> 00:17:02.657
born in this age,
and I above all men unhappy

00:17:02.657 --> 00:17:07.211
that I was not born in theirs:
for had I encountered those

00:17:07.211 --> 00:17:11.556
gallants,
neither had Troy been burnt nor

00:17:11.556 --> 00:17:16.452
Carthage destroyed;
since, by my killing Paris

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:21.660
only, all of these mischief had
been prevented.'

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:28.368
'I hold a wager,' quoth Sancho,
â€˜that ere it be long,

00:17:28.368 --> 00:17:31.568
there will not be either
victualling-house,

00:17:31.568 --> 00:17:36.056
tavern, inn or barber's shop,
in which the history of our

00:17:36.056 --> 00:17:41.232
exploits will not be painted,
but I could wish they may be

00:17:41.232 --> 00:17:46.086
done by the hand of a better
painter than he that did

00:17:46.086 --> 00:17:48.420
these.'"
Unquote.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:53.031
Anyone who has been to Spain,
especially to Madrid-Barajas'

00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:57.884
airport--I'm very amuse by the
name of that airport all of the

00:17:57.884 --> 00:17:59.804
time;
"barajas"

00:17:59.804 --> 00:18:01.935
means "playing
cards," but Barajas is

00:18:01.935 --> 00:18:04.808
simply the name of the town in
which the airport was built.

00:18:04.808 --> 00:18:10.267
Anyone who has been to Spain,
especially to Madrid-Barajas'

00:18:10.267 --> 00:18:14.690
airport knows that Sancho has
won the wager,

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:20.404
for there are hundreds of
painted and sculpted figurines

00:18:20.404 --> 00:18:25.808
of Don Quixote and Sancho or
every kind for sale,

00:18:25.808 --> 00:18:31.240
including mouse pads for
computers, believe me.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.236
In fact, the statues of Don
Quixote and Sancho graze the

00:18:35.236 --> 00:18:37.779
Plaza de España in
Madrid.

00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:41.960
If you have been to Madrid,
you have seen them,

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.413
I'm sure, if you have not,
when you do,

00:18:45.413 --> 00:18:49.049
you will go see them,
I'm sure, too.

00:18:49.049 --> 00:18:55.410
We have several images of them.
 

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.743
I believe that Spain is the
only country in which there are

00:18:58.743 --> 00:19:00.700
statues of fictional characters.
 

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:06.182
I don't think that there is a
statue of the Pilgrim in Dante's

00:19:06.182 --> 00:19:09.935
Commedia in Italy,
as far as I know,

00:19:09.935 --> 00:19:11.900
or of Hamlet,
in England,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.529
as far as I know.
 

00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:15.490
It's quite remarkable.
 

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.464
Such has been the
identification of the

00:19:18.464 --> 00:19:20.278
Quixote with Spain.
 

00:19:20.278 --> 00:19:23.328
Spanish culture and the Spanish
language,

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:26.531
that, as we shall see a bit
later, some of its modern

00:19:26.531 --> 00:19:28.661
writers,
some of the modern Spanish

00:19:28.661 --> 00:19:31.673
writers,
Unamuno, have even spoken of

00:19:31.673 --> 00:19:35.546
the religion of quixotism,
"religión del

00:19:35.546 --> 00:19:36.660
quijotismo."
 

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:52.578
There we are.
 

00:19:52.578 --> 00:19:56.205
Cervantes knew that his
protagonist would be one with

00:19:56.205 --> 00:20:00.270
those of classical times;
a heady assumption for an

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.807
artist of the sixteenth and
seventeenth century whose

00:20:04.807 --> 00:20:08.558
reverence for classical art was
immense.

00:20:08.558 --> 00:20:13.895
I don't know if he could have,
of course, foreseen that there

00:20:13.895 --> 00:20:18.431
would be a statue of his
protagonists in his town of

00:20:18.431 --> 00:20:19.410
Madrid.
 

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:25.948
It is a realization,
that is, of the importance of

00:20:25.948 --> 00:20:30.153
his characters,
particularly of Don Quixote,

00:20:30.153 --> 00:20:32.858
based on the accomplishment of
his hero,

00:20:32.858 --> 00:20:37.375
which, as I haven been saying,
is quite different from those

00:20:37.375 --> 00:20:39.288
of the likes of Aeneas.
 

00:20:39.288 --> 00:20:46.970
Don Quixote returns a conqueror
of himself, says Sancho,

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:56.335
as they enter their village;
and I quote now from our

00:20:56.335 --> 00:21:03.369
translation--page 933:
"Open thine arms,

00:21:03.369 --> 00:21:08.191
and receive likewise [he is
addressing the unnamed village

00:21:08.191 --> 00:21:12.588
as they come into the town]
thy son Don Quixote,

00:21:12.588 --> 00:21:19.868
who, if he comes conquered by
another's hand,

00:21:19.868 --> 00:21:25.548
yet he comes a conqueror of
himself,

00:21:25.548 --> 00:21:31.210
which, as I have heard him say,
is the greatest victory that

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.223
can be desired!"
 

00:21:33.223 --> 00:21:34.279
Unquote.
 

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:38.019
This is Don Quixote's greatest
triumph.

00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:40.588
What does this mean?
 

00:21:40.588 --> 00:21:46.119
At the most literal level,
it means that he has accepted

00:21:46.119 --> 00:21:51.550
his defeat at the hands of the
Knight of the White Moon

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:56.002
gracefully,
and is willing to abide by the

00:21:56.002 --> 00:22:01.691
rules agreed upon before combat
with that Knight of the White

00:22:01.691 --> 00:22:02.450
Moon.
 

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:07.608
In that way,
he has conquered himself,

00:22:07.608 --> 00:22:12.410
but it may also mean what I
have suggested,

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:18.125
that the Knight of the White
Moon is a reflection of Don

00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:23.105
Quixote himself,
hence, that he has been

00:22:23.105 --> 00:22:27.680
vanquished by his own
projection,

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.210
by himself.
 

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:34.089
I think that,
more broadly speaking,

00:22:34.089 --> 00:22:38.781
it means that Don Quixote has
come to know himself better,

00:22:38.781 --> 00:22:41.910
and accept himself for what he
is;

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:46.444
that he has vanquished within
him his madness,

00:22:46.444 --> 00:22:48.358
or he's about to.
 

00:22:48.358 --> 00:22:53.012
As we heard in the quotation
about Helen and Dido this has

00:22:53.012 --> 00:22:58.068
not been quite accomplished yet;
he talks about defeating Paris.

00:22:58.068 --> 00:23:03.036
But we have also seen that,
since the Cave of Montesinos

00:23:03.036 --> 00:23:06.051
episode,
Don Quixote has been dealing

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:09.230
differently with reality and
with himself,

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:15.788
so his return is a triumphant
one, according to Sancho.

00:23:15.788 --> 00:23:19.736
There is also an echo here of
the Greek "know

00:23:19.736 --> 00:23:23.279
thyself"
that Don Quixote has vanquished

00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:27.710
himself because he has come to
really know himself.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:34.130
So we finally come to the end.
 

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:42.452
We should begin by pondering,
why ends or endings are so

00:23:42.452 --> 00:23:44.269
important?
 

00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:50.165
Let me summarize what Frank
Kermode says in his beautiful

00:23:50.165 --> 00:23:55.220
book The Sense of an
Ending, from 1966.

00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:00.326
I will get to a long quotation
from that book that you have in

00:24:00.326 --> 00:24:05.434
a handout with the bibliographic
information about the book by

00:24:05.434 --> 00:24:06.440
Kermode.
 

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.563
By now, he's Sir Frank Kermode;
he's an Englishman who was

00:24:10.563 --> 00:24:13.835
knighted by the Queen;
an excellent critic,

00:24:13.835 --> 00:24:16.784
one of the better,
perhaps the best critic of the

00:24:16.784 --> 00:24:19.980
English language,
although I see that tremulously

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:24.432
because if Harold Bloom hears
that I have said something like

00:24:24.432 --> 00:24:27.660
that,
my life may be in danger.

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:34.740
Every time I leave this class,
or another class,

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.400
I encounter Harold Bloom who
yells at the top of his lungs,

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.923
"Oh Roberto,
here comes the second best

00:24:40.923 --> 00:24:42.808
critic at Yale!"
 

00:24:42.808 --> 00:24:47.297
meaning that he,
of course, is the first to

00:24:47.297 --> 00:24:49.952
which I answer,
"Harold,

00:24:49.952 --> 00:24:52.827
we belong to different
generations and you belong to

00:24:52.827 --> 00:24:54.519
the one that is past."
 

00:24:54.519 --> 00:25:02.728
There is a right to defend
oneself, even from this Knight

00:25:02.728 --> 00:25:05.660
of the White Moon.
 

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:11.550
All of us, in the modern era,
think that we live in a world

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.410
of crisis;
that is at the end of an epoch

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.140
and the beginning of the next.
 

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.444
Hence, we are keenly concerned
with the sense of what we

00:25:22.444 --> 00:25:24.950
perceive as the impending end.
 

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:29.750
The sense that it can give to
the past--the sense that that

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.558
end can give to the past,
and to the future.

00:25:33.558 --> 00:25:37.182
The fictions that we create
reflect this anxiety and are

00:25:37.182 --> 00:25:40.804
designed to show "the
concord of the middest,"

00:25:40.804 --> 00:25:43.900
which is what Kermode calls our
condition,

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:48.710
man or women in the middest,
in the middle;

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:53.970
this middest that we inhabit,
with beginnings and ends.

00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:57.125
These fictions,
in which there is this

00:25:57.125 --> 00:26:01.817
relationship between beginning
and end our Kermode calls

00:26:01.817 --> 00:26:04.890
"fictions of concord."
 

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.730
There seems to be,
according to him,

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:11.858
a human need to relate
beginnings to ends,

00:26:11.858 --> 00:26:15.670
even if we are not religious
believers,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:20.359
or believers in secular version
of Providence,

00:26:20.359 --> 00:26:22.940
like Marxism.
 

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:26.640
Providence, from
providere,

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.116
means foresight,
to--but mostly,

00:26:30.116 --> 00:26:36.733
providence means the care of a
benevolent God who guides our

00:26:36.733 --> 00:26:39.650
lives and our steps.
 

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:43.113
"Apocalypse"
is one of the fictions of

00:26:43.113 --> 00:26:46.826
concord;
it ends, transforms and is

00:26:46.826 --> 00:26:48.200
concordant.
 

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.921
"Apocalypse"
is from the Greek "to

00:26:51.921 --> 00:26:55.098
uncover,"
which means revelation,

00:26:55.098 --> 00:26:58.130
hence the Book of Revelation,
the last in the New Testament.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:03.431
Prophecy is another form;
it tells us the shape of the

00:27:03.431 --> 00:27:05.957
future;
it connects the present with

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.288
that end and beyond.
 

00:27:07.288 --> 00:27:11.605
We are born in the middle,
and, according to Kermode:

00:27:11.605 --> 00:27:16.752
"to make sense of our span
we need effective concords with

00:27:16.752 --> 00:27:20.994
origins and ends,
such as give meanings to lives

00:27:20.994 --> 00:27:22.523
and to poems."
 

00:27:22.523 --> 00:27:23.328
Unquote.
 

00:27:23.328 --> 00:27:27.833
Millenarianism,
the end is near--you have seen

00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:33.237
all of these cartoons of the
guys holding the cardboard

00:27:33.237 --> 00:27:37.122
saying the end is near,
repent, and so

00:27:37.122 --> 00:27:41.450
forth--millenarianism has to do
with a thousand years,

00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:45.680
with something lasting a
thousand years,

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.746
like those who believe that the
end of the world would come in

00:27:49.746 --> 00:27:53.838
the year 1000,
and some even in the 2000.

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.692
If you remember,
back in 2000 there were all

00:27:55.692 --> 00:27:56.640
kinds of prophecies.
 

00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:00.555
Of course, all of these people
who prophesized are quick to

00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:01.500
recalculate.
 

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.640
If it doesn't happen,
they recalculate.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:08.481
It wasn't in the year 1000;
it was since the death of

00:28:08.481 --> 00:28:10.816
Christ, 1033,
I mean, they always

00:28:10.816 --> 00:28:11.910
recalculate.
 

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:16.104
The year 2000 came and went,
and many people were waiting

00:28:16.104 --> 00:28:19.250
for all kinds of catastrophes to
happen.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:31.470
Chiliasm is another word you
should remember.

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:35.384
"Chiliastic"
from the Greek for one thousand

00:28:35.384 --> 00:28:39.298
is the belief that Christ will
rise in 1,000 years.

00:28:39.298 --> 00:28:43.490
So we have beginning,
man or woman in the middest,

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:47.563
and end, and in the long quote
that I will read now from

00:28:47.563 --> 00:28:51.858
Kermode this is how he explains
in a very charming way:

00:28:51.858 --> 00:28:59.210
"Let us take a very simple
example, the ticking of a clock.

00:28:59.210 --> 00:29:05.545
We ask what it says:
and we agree that it says

00:29:05.545 --> 00:29:07.858
tick tock.
 

00:29:07.858 --> 00:29:09.940
[Of course, this is only in
English.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.661
In Spanish it goes 'tic,
tac,' but in any event,

00:29:13.661 --> 00:29:17.618
since we are speaking English
it's 'tick tock'].

00:29:17.618 --> 00:29:23.460
By this fiction we humanize it,
making it talk our language.

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:27.157
Of course, it is we who provide
the fictional difference between

00:29:27.157 --> 00:29:29.740
the two sounds:
tick is our word for a

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:33.829
physical beginning,
tock our word for an end.

00:29:33.829 --> 00:29:35.328
We say they differ.
 

00:29:35.328 --> 00:29:38.202
What enables them to be
different is a special kind of

00:29:38.202 --> 00:29:38.690
middle.
 

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:41.838
We can perceive a duration only
when it is organized.

00:29:41.838 --> 00:29:45.106
It can be shown by experiment
that subjects who listen to

00:29:45.106 --> 00:29:48.298
rhythmic structures,
such as tick-tock

00:29:48.298 --> 00:29:52.481
repeated identically,
can reproduce the intervals

00:29:52.481 --> 00:29:57.518
within the structure accurately,
but they cannot grasp

00:29:57.518 --> 00:30:02.561
spontaneously the interval
between the rhythmic groups

00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:05.340
[that is,
the rhythmic group is

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.470
"tick-tock,"
okay?

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:09.400
each group is
"tick-tock";

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:13.837
so they cannot spontaneously
grasp the interval between

00:30:13.837 --> 00:30:16.343
rhythmic groups,
that is, between

00:30:16.343 --> 00:30:18.582
"tock,"
and "tick,"

00:30:18.582 --> 00:30:22.565
where the next group begins;
Okay: "Tick-tock,"

00:30:22.565 --> 00:30:27.788
Mmm, "Tick-tock";
so "tock--tick," okay?

00:30:27.788 --> 00:30:32.374
If anyone came in,
and listened to me now,

00:30:32.374 --> 00:30:38.190
would certainly conclude that I
have gone bonkers;

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:43.490
that Don Quixote's madness is
really contagious].

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:46.719
The first interval is organized
and limited

00:30:46.719 --> 00:30:50.410
["tick-tock"]
and the second is not.

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:53.674
According to Paul Fraise [I
don't know who it is]

00:30:53.674 --> 00:30:57.415
the tock-tick gap is
analogous to the role of the

00:30:57.415 --> 00:31:00.817
'ground' in spatial perception
[that is, blurry and

00:31:00.817 --> 00:31:04.248
undifferentiated];
each is characterized by a lack

00:31:04.248 --> 00:31:07.554
of form, against which the
illusory organizations of shape

00:31:07.554 --> 00:31:11.150
and rhythm are perceived in the
spatial or temporal object.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:14.969
The fact that we call the
second of the two related sounds

00:31:14.969 --> 00:31:19.056
tock is evidence that we
use fictions to enable the end

00:31:19.056 --> 00:31:23.210
to confer organization and form
on the temporal structure.

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:27.147
The interval between the two
sounds, between tick and

00:31:27.147 --> 00:31:30.818
tock is now charged with
significant duration.

00:31:30.818 --> 00:31:36.365
The clock's tick-tock I
take to be the model for what we

00:31:36.365 --> 00:31:41.374
call a plot, [the plot...]
an organization that humanizes

00:31:41.374 --> 00:31:45.522
time by giving it form;
and the interval between

00:31:45.522 --> 00:31:49.567
tock and tick
represents purely successive,

00:31:49.567 --> 00:31:53.828
disorganized time of the sort
we need to humanize."

00:31:53.828 --> 00:31:59.676
That's the end of this,
I think, very illustrative

00:31:59.676 --> 00:32:01.109
quotation.
 

00:32:01.109 --> 00:32:05.038
So, the end is meaning;
the end provides meaning,

00:32:05.038 --> 00:32:07.529
and this is why it is so
necessary.

00:32:07.529 --> 00:32:10.660
He goes on, Kermode:
"Men, in the middest,

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:14.990
make considerable imaginative
investments in coherent

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.490
patterns,
which by the provision of an

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:22.420
end make possible a satisfying
consonance,

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:27.140
with origins and with the
middle" Unquote.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.613
The plots of our poems,
plays and novels reflect that

00:32:31.613 --> 00:32:34.279
need for significant endings.
 

00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:40.895
So what is the significance of
Don Quixote's ending,

00:32:40.895 --> 00:32:43.880
or is it significant?
 

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:50.128
In the next to the last chapter
Sancho discards the omens that

00:32:50.128 --> 00:32:55.150
Don Quixote sees in various
things and events,

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.951
as they come into the village,
omens which will connect the

00:32:58.951 --> 00:33:01.769
end of the novel with a future
beyond it;

00:33:01.769 --> 00:33:03.630
they are prophetic.
 

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:07.243
I'm quoting from 934:
"'Malum signum,

00:33:07.243 --> 00:33:10.118
malum signum! [this is
Latin;

00:33:10.118 --> 00:33:11.738
"bad sign,
bad sign]

00:33:11.738 --> 00:33:13.894
A hare flies;
dogs pursue her,

00:33:13.894 --> 00:33:19.170
Dulcinea appears not!'"
Says Don Quixote.

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.952
Remember the hare that is
running and that Sancho actually

00:33:22.952 --> 00:33:26.140
catches because she's so tired,
it's so tired.

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.510
In the Spanish Don Quixote
actually says:

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:30.585
"Liebre huye,
galgos la siguen:

00:33:30.585 --> 00:33:32.720
¡Dulcinea no
parece!"

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:38.493
Jarvis has given it syntax,
which in Spanish it does not

00:33:38.493 --> 00:33:39.230
have.
 

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:45.070
Don Quixote has abandoned
syntax and appears to speak in

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:48.503
tongues,
as if he were having a vision

00:33:48.503 --> 00:33:52.747
or a revelation,
which is what he's trying to

00:33:52.747 --> 00:33:59.362
find in this bad omen,
this malum signum that

00:33:59.362 --> 00:34:00.660
he sees.
 

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.615
The incident shows that,
in his subconscious,

00:34:02.615 --> 00:34:05.285
is still in the world of dreams
and of literature where these

00:34:05.285 --> 00:34:06.130
concords occur.
 

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:12.849
The prophetic would extend that
world for closing and ending.

00:34:12.849 --> 00:34:15.806
But, as I said,
Sancho dismisses,

00:34:15.806 --> 00:34:20.521
but Sancho dismisses these
omens in a very wise way,

00:34:20.521 --> 00:34:23.849
appealing to Christian
doctrine.

00:34:23.849 --> 00:34:27.661
It is as if Cervantes himself
were, here, wavering about how

00:34:27.661 --> 00:34:28.889
to end the novel.
 

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:33.195
But, what is the meaning of the
end Cervantes does give the

00:34:33.195 --> 00:34:33.789
novel?
 

00:34:33.789 --> 00:34:38.400
There are in the Quixote
three forms of potential

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.239
closure.
 

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:47.519
Cervantes closes the
Quixote in three ways.

00:34:47.519 --> 00:34:51.570
First, Don Quixote is defeated;
second, he regains his sanity;

00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:53.880
third, he dies.
 

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.713
One could say that this scheme
points to a three-part tied

00:34:57.713 --> 00:35:01.614
conception of reality or of the
worlds in which Don Quixote

00:35:01.614 --> 00:35:05.581
lives with each form of closure
corresponding to each of the

00:35:05.581 --> 00:35:06.389
three.
 

00:35:06.389 --> 00:35:10.797
I've given you a handout with a
kind of crass primitive

00:35:10.797 --> 00:35:15.449
representation of these three
worlds as concentric circles

00:35:15.449 --> 00:35:19.494
that I made myself,
and this is why--and it shows

00:35:19.494 --> 00:35:22.369
it--but I hope that it is clear
enough.

00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:26.733
First, the fictional world of
chivalry, Don Quixote is

00:35:26.733 --> 00:35:27.639
defeated.
 

00:35:27.639 --> 00:35:29.840
This is the realm of books.
 

00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:34.632
Second, present day reality Don
Quixote returns to being Alonso

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.179
Quijano, the Good.
 

00:35:36.179 --> 00:35:39.634
Third, Don Quixote dies,
and presumably reaches the true

00:35:39.634 --> 00:35:41.768
reality, that is,
the afterlife.

00:35:41.768 --> 00:35:45.623
Hence, life itself was like a
fiction, in that it was

00:35:45.623 --> 00:35:49.699
ephemeral and made up of things
of dubious substance.

00:35:49.699 --> 00:35:52.541
It's a self contained,
one could say,

00:35:52.541 --> 00:35:54.199
fiction of concord.
 

00:35:54.199 --> 00:35:58.311
A possible fourth form of
closure, at a meta-fictional

00:35:58.311 --> 00:36:02.735
level, would be that the defeat
of Avellaneda's apocryphal

00:36:02.735 --> 00:36:04.210
Quixote.
 

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:07.900
But let us go over the three in
more detail.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.869
First, the fictional world of
chivalry.

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:14.829
Don Quixote is defeated by the
Knight of the White Moon,

00:36:14.829 --> 00:36:20.117
hence his quest comes to an end
within his madness and within

00:36:20.117 --> 00:36:23.289
the fiction of chivalric
romances.

00:36:23.289 --> 00:36:28.987
But as I said in the last
class, and I said a few minutes

00:36:28.987 --> 00:36:31.367
ago,
there are signs that the Knight

00:36:31.367 --> 00:36:34.164
of the White Moon is like a
reflection of Don Quixote

00:36:34.164 --> 00:36:38.226
himself or of his madness,
and, more profoundly,

00:36:38.226 --> 00:36:43.271
of that nothingness,
that was his very fragile

00:36:43.271 --> 00:36:46.250
being, his very fragile self.
 

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:51.369
This is why this Knight is
White almost transparent,

00:36:51.369 --> 00:36:53.880
a ghost of Don Quixote.
 

00:36:53.880 --> 00:37:00.456
So this defeat within the world
of books announces or prefigures

00:37:00.456 --> 00:37:06.530
his regaining his sanity,
and even announces his death,

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:13.110
as white suggests nothingness,
hence, it suggests death.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:17.079
Then, there is present day
reality;

00:37:17.079 --> 00:37:19.739
Alonso Quijano regains his
sanity.

00:37:19.739 --> 00:37:21.268
It is like a conversion story.
 

00:37:21.268 --> 00:37:27.500
The conversion story is
typically a man who--

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.969
the old man dies,
and the new man is reborn,

00:37:31.969 --> 00:37:35.307
that is, a conversion story,
so there is a death and

00:37:35.307 --> 00:37:36.880
resurrection involved.
 

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:42.309
Don Quixote sleeps and awakens
changed,

00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:45.579
as if he had undergone a
mystical experience,

00:37:45.579 --> 00:37:48.282
similar to the sleep and
awakening after the Cave of

00:37:48.282 --> 00:37:52.119
Montesinos episode,
which prefigured this one.

00:37:52.119 --> 00:37:57.592
How can he know that he has now
awakened to his true self and

00:37:57.592 --> 00:37:58.780
real world?
 

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:05.130
Don Quixote had the memory of
who he had been,

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:09.550
but if his life as Don Quixote
is now complete,

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.610
and his life is about to be
complete,

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.719
his life as Alonso Quijano,
what differentiates the two?

00:38:15.719 --> 00:38:20.500
This is the conundrum of
Segismundo in Calderón's

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.780
Life is a Dream,
that play that it have

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.333
recounted to you several times
where the young prince is

00:38:26.333 --> 00:38:28.074
drugged,
taken to the palace,

00:38:28.074 --> 00:38:31.503
he commits all kinds of crimes,
he's drugged,

00:38:31.503 --> 00:38:35.586
taken back to the tower,
and he awakes,

00:38:35.586 --> 00:38:40.545
and he can't tell if it was a
dream what he experienced in the

00:38:40.545 --> 00:38:44.889
palace,
or if he's now dreaming in the

00:38:44.889 --> 00:38:47.420
tower, he can't tell.
 

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.250
So Segismundo's answer in
Calderón's play is to cut

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:55.420
through the ambiguity,
and will himself to be good,

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.070
to be good because life may be
a dream,

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:03.670
but it may be a rehearsal for a
life that is more enduring.

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:09.230
Now, the afterlife,
that outer circle.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.018
Don Quixote's death,
he dies, by the way,

00:39:12.018 --> 00:39:16.070
I don't know if you have taken
notice of this,

00:39:16.070 --> 00:39:19.219
but he dies unmarried and
without succession,

00:39:19.219 --> 00:39:23.420
which is evident in the scene
with the notary when he's

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.873
dictating his testament,
because he has to leave

00:39:26.873 --> 00:39:29.820
everything to his niece and
friends and so forth.

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:33.367
Again, it is very much like
Segismundo's awakening to the

00:39:33.367 --> 00:39:35.650
dream like quality of life
itself.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.438
It is as if all of life were
like a dream,

00:39:38.438 --> 00:39:42.519
his madness was a dream within
that dream, and death the only

00:39:42.519 --> 00:39:44.969
access to a true permanent life.
 

00:39:44.969 --> 00:39:49.175
Hence, it is not only his
madness that is like a dream,

00:39:49.175 --> 00:39:50.889
but everything else.
 

00:39:50.889 --> 00:39:53.139
His madness is a dream within a
dream.

00:39:53.139 --> 00:39:56.844
Only death can put an end to
the play of reflections,

00:39:56.844 --> 00:40:00.619
and in a way this is why Alonso
Quijano has to die.

00:40:00.619 --> 00:40:06.271
Don Quixote's death is the last
in a series of mock deaths that

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:11.739
have appeared throughout the
book and prefigured this one;

00:40:11.739 --> 00:40:14.730
one at the end of Part I,
when he's knocked unconscious;

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:18.130
then, of course,
in the Cave of Montesinos.

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:22.128
Don Quixote's death is the last
in a series of mock deaths,

00:40:22.128 --> 00:40:23.300
as I have said.
 

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.391
One has to take into account
that the death of Don Quixote,

00:40:26.391 --> 00:40:29.909
at least within the plot of the
novel, is also a kind of return.

00:40:29.909 --> 00:40:33.369
Don Quixote returns home to the
heimlich,

00:40:33.369 --> 00:40:36.018
to use Freud's word,
to the familiar,

00:40:36.018 --> 00:40:38.963
to the place where he was
Alonso Quijano,

00:40:38.963 --> 00:40:40.730
where he was sane.
 

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:45.755
This makes the entire series of
episodes that make up the whole

00:40:45.755 --> 00:40:50.699
book his madness like a bubble,
or a dream all the more so.

00:40:50.699 --> 00:40:54.355
It is like the Barataria
episodes are to Sancho,

00:40:54.355 --> 00:40:55.599
another dream.
 

00:40:55.599 --> 00:41:00.250
Repetitions of this kind lead
one to consider the fiction in

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:04.349
between as something that one
could dispense with.

00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:08.478
Do the events within that
bubble occur in some sort of

00:41:08.478 --> 00:41:12.684
concert with one another,
or are they themselves just a

00:41:12.684 --> 00:41:14.710
series of repetitions?
 

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.739
Is there a successive sense to
the novel's plot?

00:41:18.739 --> 00:41:22.143
Is there a sequential quality
to the novel,

00:41:22.143 --> 00:41:27.005
a temporal--a temporality in
the Quixote that leads to

00:41:27.005 --> 00:41:28.059
that end?
 

00:41:28.059 --> 00:41:30.518
For instance,
we have been able to more or

00:41:30.518 --> 00:41:33.460
less follow the months,
and perhaps even the days,

00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:36.039
during which the adventures
take place;

00:41:36.039 --> 00:41:40.235
but, is there a sense of
temporality, of chronology,

00:41:40.235 --> 00:41:41.800
of inevitability?
 

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.599
We know that he has to return
at some point to the village,

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:48.679
as he did before,
and once he's defeated we know

00:41:48.679 --> 00:41:51.300
that his madness is now on the
wane.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:56.041
There is inevitably in the
transience of his madness,

00:41:56.041 --> 00:42:00.599
of this invention of self,
and of his very life.

00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:03.722
On the other hand,
a close reading of the last

00:42:03.722 --> 00:42:08.025
chapter does not reveal anything
about the death of Cide Hamete

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:09.969
Benengeli, for instance.
 

00:42:09.969 --> 00:42:14.550
When did Cide Hamete Benengeli
die?

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:18.280
There is no total closure in
the Quixote possible.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.260
I think Cervantes plays with it
ironically;

00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.791
he knows that no matter how may
times he says Don Quixote is

00:42:24.791 --> 00:42:27.322
dead,
and that Cide Hamete is hanging

00:42:27.322 --> 00:42:32.038
his pen and addressing his pen,
that any writer can still come

00:42:32.038 --> 00:42:35.288
up as Juan Montalvo did--
I think I may have mentioned

00:42:35.288 --> 00:42:38.335
him before--
an Ecuatorian writer,

00:42:38.335 --> 00:42:44.545
who wrote a wonderful book
called Chapters of the

00:42:44.545 --> 00:42:49.050
Quixote that Cervantes
Forgot;

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:55.909
and it's a pastiche,
meaning it's imitating

00:42:55.909 --> 00:42:58.710
Cervantes's style.
 

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:04.335
So Cervantes knows--and we will
talk about that when we talk

00:43:04.335 --> 00:43:09.865
about Pierre Menard,
the story by Borges in our next

00:43:09.865 --> 00:43:10.820
class.
 

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:13.989
The Quixote is not a
book that has a plot in the

00:43:13.989 --> 00:43:16.280
Aristotelian sense with a
beginning,

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.820
a middle, and an end,
all tied together tightly in a

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.460
sequence of events leading a
finish.

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:27.420
It is the life of Don Quixote
that gives it form,

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:30.516
as in the picaresque the life
of the pícaro

00:43:30.516 --> 00:43:33.717
gives form to the narrative,
and we can think here,

00:43:33.717 --> 00:43:37.706
again, of what Ginés de
Pasamonte said jokingly about

00:43:37.706 --> 00:43:41.630
not finishing his book because
his life is unfinished,

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:45.650
poking fun at that
autobiography as a convention.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:48.679
The book has to end with his
death;

00:43:48.679 --> 00:43:52.110
death is a form of closure that
everyone understands;

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:56.010
it gives life shape.
 

00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:02.005
Quevedo, Francisco de Quevedo,
a great poet of the seventeenth

00:44:02.005 --> 00:44:02.989
century.
 

00:44:02.989 --> 00:44:11.206
I urge you to read Quevedo,
and one way to do so is to tell

00:44:11.206 --> 00:44:18.856
you that he wrote some of the
most obscene poems in the

00:44:18.856 --> 00:44:26.391
history of the Spanish language,
also some of the most beautiful

00:44:26.391 --> 00:44:27.280
love poems.
 

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.954
Perhaps--Borges said that
Quevedo was a whole literature

00:44:31.954 --> 00:44:33.400
all by himself.
 

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:37.525
He has a poem about death in
which he ends by saying that

00:44:37.525 --> 00:44:41.429
death will organize his life,
will give it meaning.

00:44:41.429 --> 00:44:50.815
So death provides an end toward
which everything will seem to

00:44:50.815 --> 00:44:54.099
have been pointing.
 

00:44:54.099 --> 00:44:56.739
Aristotelian plots are
artificial.

00:44:56.739 --> 00:44:59.452
The ones that will be
"tick-tock,"

00:44:59.452 --> 00:45:03.237
unless you believe that there
is a tight concert to the world

00:45:03.237 --> 00:45:05.900
and to history,
or unless you begin to believe

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:06.599
in Providence.
 

00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:10.023
In this sense,
Cervantes is showing that the

00:45:10.023 --> 00:45:13.905
novel,
as a form, cannot be bound by

00:45:13.905 --> 00:45:18.686
these artificial shapes of art,
like the epic,

00:45:18.686 --> 00:45:22.382
and like tragedy,
but by the shape of life as

00:45:22.382 --> 00:45:27.284
everyone understands it;
ort of a baggy monster that he

00:45:27.284 --> 00:45:29.570
has created in the novel.
 

00:45:29.570 --> 00:45:33.871
This is profoundly so when we
take into account that

00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:38.396
Cervantes' own death is near,
as he writes about Don

00:45:38.396 --> 00:45:41.083
Quixote's death,
and we will be talking about

00:45:41.083 --> 00:45:42.619
Cervantes' death in the next
class.

00:45:42.619 --> 00:45:47.498
This is also the reason why
there is, for instance,

00:45:47.498 --> 00:45:51.693
no closure to the story of Ana
Félix,

00:45:51.693 --> 00:45:53.840
Ricote's daughter.
 

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:58.146
One may ask,
also, why there is so little

00:45:58.146 --> 00:46:02.239
about Don Quixote's birth and
youth?

00:46:02.239 --> 00:46:05.233
One could say that the only
life of Don Quixote that is

00:46:05.233 --> 00:46:08.782
worth knowing is his life as the
mad knight, that everything else

00:46:08.782 --> 00:46:10.389
is of little consequence.
 

00:46:10.389 --> 00:46:15.306
So it is the life that Don
Quixote offered for himself that

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:21.432
is important in the conception,
execution and structure of the

00:46:21.432 --> 00:46:23.503
book,
but it is a life,

00:46:23.503 --> 00:46:27.369
not a completed action in the
Aristotelian sense.

00:46:27.369 --> 00:46:34.469
Why not end the book then by
making him sane?

00:46:34.469 --> 00:46:38.780
A sane Don Quixote would close
the plot of Don Quixote's

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:42.230
meta-life, his life as art and
literature.

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:45.766
One answer would be to say that
only by making him die can

00:46:45.766 --> 00:46:49.550
Cervantes blur the distinction
between our daily lives and the

00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:53.481
invented lives of literature,
both have endings with

00:46:53.481 --> 00:46:54.639
significance.
 

00:46:54.639 --> 00:46:58.347
So Don Quixote's death as Don
Quixote and his rebirth as

00:46:58.347 --> 00:47:01.650
Alonso Quijano is not enough to
close the book;

00:47:01.650 --> 00:47:06.382
he also had to die,
but only if the theme of the

00:47:06.382 --> 00:47:09.547
book is,
and I believe that it is,

00:47:09.547 --> 00:47:15.443
the unreality of worldly life,
and our hope for a real life

00:47:15.443 --> 00:47:16.960
after death.
 

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:22.760
Now, I'm going to just mention
what some authors,

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:26.009
major authors,
said about the shape of the

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:30.219
Quixote, since we can look
at it as a whole shape,

00:47:30.219 --> 00:47:37.280
and I will then get to the
author I mentioned before,

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.619
Miguel de Unamuno.
 

00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:43.132
I may have mentioned him
before, I mentioned certainly

00:47:43.132 --> 00:47:45.851
Ortega y Gasset,
who was the great Spanish

00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:48.570
philosopher of the twentieth
century.

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:54.342
Miguel de Unamuno was a
philosopher, but also a writer,

00:47:54.342 --> 00:47:58.940
a novelist, a poet,
a thinker in general.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:02.621
He was the rector or president
of the University of Salamanca,

00:48:02.621 --> 00:48:05.579
what we would call today a
public intellectual.

00:48:05.579 --> 00:48:10.755
He was exiled by the
dictatorship of Primo de Rivera

00:48:10.755 --> 00:48:13.710
and he wrote--
he was a Basque,

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:18.047
born in Bilbao in 1864,
and died in Salamanca in 1936,

00:48:18.047 --> 00:48:21.659
just at the beginning of the
Spanish Civil War.

00:48:21.659 --> 00:48:25.630
You may have heard the titles
of some his books,

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.518
Del sentimiento
trágico de la vida,

00:48:28.518 --> 00:48:30.768
On the Tragic Sense of
Life, a book that I

00:48:30.768 --> 00:48:34.007
recommend that you read,
La agonía de

00:48:34.007 --> 00:48:37.699
cristianismo,
The Agony of Christianity,

00:48:37.699 --> 00:48:41.992
and a very, very well known
novel called Niebla,

00:48:41.992 --> 00:48:44.139
Mist, from 1914.
 

00:48:44.139 --> 00:48:51.559
In 1905 Unamuno published
Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho,

00:48:51.559 --> 00:48:53.889
The Life of Don Quixote and
Sancho,

00:48:53.889 --> 00:48:57.550
which is a commentary,
chapter by chapter,

00:48:57.550 --> 00:49:02.612
of the Quixote,
a very sui generis kind

00:49:02.612 --> 00:49:04.170
of commentary.
 

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:07.130
Unamuno liked to be outrageous.
 

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:12.469
For instance,
Unamuno says that he believes,

00:49:12.469 --> 00:49:14.913
or feigns to believe,
in the real existence of Don

00:49:14.913 --> 00:49:17.951
Quixote and Sancho,
claiming that Cervantes a

00:49:17.951 --> 00:49:22.378
mediocre writer by a stroke of
luck got to write the story

00:49:22.378 --> 00:49:26.650
written about the pair by one
Cide Hamete Benengeli;

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:28.869
so this is his conceit.
 

00:49:28.869 --> 00:49:33.768
So he riles against Cervantes.
 

00:49:33.768 --> 00:49:38.824
For Unamuno there is no
assurance that Don Quixote will

00:49:38.824 --> 00:49:41.260
find a life after death.
 

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:45.541
This is talking about the death
of Don Quixote,

00:49:45.541 --> 00:49:49.824
stressing that,
perhaps, this life is all there

00:49:49.824 --> 00:49:53.550
is, and that it is like God's
dream;

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:57.523
so he hopes that God will go on
dreaming us, he says,

00:49:57.523 --> 00:50:00.657
humorously, because,
if he stops dreaming,

00:50:00.657 --> 00:50:04.480
we will all disappear along
with the universe.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:09.630
God gave us the desire to be
immortal,

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:14.289
like him, and created a symbol
of it in Don Quixote,

00:50:14.289 --> 00:50:17.949
who does what he does because
he wants to be immortal,

00:50:17.949 --> 00:50:22.936
and so Unamuno mourns Don
Quixote's passing and riles

00:50:22.936 --> 00:50:27.539
against Cervantes for
trivializing his death,

00:50:27.539 --> 00:50:33.108
and he affirms that,
at least, Don Quixote passed on

00:50:33.108 --> 00:50:35.730
his madness to Sancho.
 

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:38.898
You remember in the last scene,
there, where Sancho says,

00:50:38.898 --> 00:50:41.050
don't die, please,
let us go on now!

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:46.369
And so it is Sancho who will
carry on with the madness.

00:50:46.369 --> 00:50:50.940
Unamuno goes on to say that
Antonia Quijana,

00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:56.452
the niece, does marry a
sensible boring man who never

00:50:56.452 --> 00:51:01.894
heard of chivalric romances,
so therefore she inherits,

00:51:01.894 --> 00:51:06.041
and she forces him to live a
humdrum life devoid of

00:51:06.041 --> 00:51:07.119
adventure.
 

00:51:07.119 --> 00:51:12.900
Be the kind of husband who
takes out the garbage,

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:15.429
but takes no risks.
 

00:51:15.429 --> 00:51:20.070
Dulcinea, however,
or Aldonza Lorenzo,

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:23.351
on the other hand does
understand her elevation to

00:51:23.351 --> 00:51:26.885
ideal lady,
and she leads men to heroic

00:51:26.885 --> 00:51:30.594
action,
that is, the ideal of such a

00:51:30.594 --> 00:51:36.079
lady leads men to ideal action
meaning to take risks.

00:51:36.079 --> 00:51:40.911
She and Sancho keep alive,
according to Unamuno,

00:51:40.911 --> 00:51:46.873
the religion of Don Quixote,
which is on the wane in Spain,

00:51:46.873 --> 00:51:50.369
as he writes his book in 1905.
 

00:51:50.369 --> 00:51:54.150
He complains:
"With Spain having been

00:51:54.150 --> 00:52:00.239
defeated in the Spanish-American
War by the United States."

00:52:00.239 --> 00:52:05.510
For him, this defeat signals
the end of quijotismo,

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:08.889
this having been defeated by
this upstart nation,

00:52:08.889 --> 00:52:16.250
and he longs for a return of
the quixotic spirit to Spain,

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:20.563
one that rebels against
commonplace reality and abhors

00:52:20.563 --> 00:52:23.170
mediocrity and submissiveness.
 

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:27.789
He belonged to the so called
Generation of '98,

00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:30.780
which is a collection of
writers, a group of writers,

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:35.092
who all wrote about the
miseries of Spain at the turn of

00:52:35.092 --> 00:52:39.233
the century,
and particularly complaining

00:52:39.233 --> 00:52:44.630
about the defeat at the hand of
the United States.

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:49.597
There is a moment in the
Spanish-American War that I call

00:52:49.597 --> 00:52:53.590
a quixotic moment,
and it is the following;

00:52:53.590 --> 00:53:00.708
this is to what degree a
country can absorb a fictional

00:53:00.708 --> 00:53:06.510
writer: Admiral Pasqual Cervera
y Topete,

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:13.539
Cervera is the last name you
want to--

00:53:13.539 --> 00:53:19.447
got himself trapped with the
whole Spanish fleet in Santiago

00:53:19.447 --> 00:53:20.849
de Cuba Bay.
 

00:53:20.849 --> 00:53:24.077
Santiago's Bay,
in Cuba, like all Cuban bays,

00:53:24.077 --> 00:53:28.186
has the virtue of being very
broad and with a very narrow

00:53:28.186 --> 00:53:29.139
entrance.
 

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:33.025
Cervera got into the bay with
all of his ships,

00:53:33.025 --> 00:53:35.644
which are wooden,
old fashioned,

00:53:35.644 --> 00:53:39.110
and guns that didn't have much
range.

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:46.855
The American fleet positioned
itself outside waiting for the

00:53:46.855 --> 00:53:54.206
inevitable moment when Cervera
either gave up or tried to

00:53:54.206 --> 00:53:55.518
leave.
 

00:53:55.518 --> 00:53:57.726
Cervera communicated with
Spain, they had cable at the

00:53:57.726 --> 00:54:00.217
time,
about his predicament,

00:54:00.217 --> 00:54:04.630
and the Spanish government
answered saying,

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:07.159
"We know that with your
valor,

00:54:07.159 --> 00:54:12.550
vigor and all of your
intelligence and cunning you

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:15.409
will be able to prevail.
 

00:54:15.409 --> 00:54:17.639
We order you to come out."
 

00:54:17.639 --> 00:54:25.349
So the Spanish fleet came out,
and it was a turkey shoot.

00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:33.690
The American fleet shot every
single one of the Spanish ships.

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:37.983
Cervera writes about this;
I've read his memoirs,

00:54:37.983 --> 00:54:42.851
that he was very satisfied that
at least the Americans pulled

00:54:42.851 --> 00:54:46.599
him out of the water;
he went down with the ship.

00:54:46.599 --> 00:54:48.480
The Americans pulled him out of
his water,

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:50.880
with is sword and everything,
put him on board,

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.657
and treated him with great
difference and sent the

00:54:54.657 --> 00:54:57.748
surviving--
the few surviving sailors were

00:54:57.748 --> 00:55:01.090
sent as prisoners of war to
Maine for a while,

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:02.619
where he was able to visit them
later.

00:55:02.619 --> 00:55:09.621
Cervera was later sued by the
Spanish government for losing

00:55:09.621 --> 00:55:14.672
the fleet;
so that was a quixotic moment

00:55:14.672 --> 00:55:19.889
of the kind Unamuno would have
applauded.

00:55:19.889 --> 00:55:24.690
So much for Unamuno.
 

00:55:24.690 --> 00:55:29.614
Borges, Jorge Luis Borges,
we're going to speak more about

00:55:29.614 --> 00:55:33.148
him in our next class;
he wrote a marvelous essay

00:55:33.148 --> 00:55:35.730
about the last chapter of the
Quixote.

00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:39.536
He points out that,
I think I've mentioned this

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:44.086
before, that the one quality
that unites Don Quixote and

00:55:44.086 --> 00:55:49.775
Alonso Quijano is courage;
that Alonso Quijano faces death

00:55:49.775 --> 00:55:52.570
with courage and serenity.
 

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:56.686
So this is the one quality that
they have in common,

00:55:56.686 --> 00:56:00.480
even if one is sane and the
other one is mad.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:03.693
He writes that:
"Cervantes could have

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:07.690
chosen a more astonishing
episode to bring about Don

00:56:07.690 --> 00:56:11.806
Quixote's return to sanity,
but chose sleeping,

00:56:11.806 --> 00:56:16.545
that mysterious world from
which we return when we awaken

00:56:16.545 --> 00:56:19.929
not knowing where we have
been."

00:56:19.929 --> 00:56:25.380
This is what Borges picks up on
those six hours of sleep,

00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:28.369
that those six hours of sleep
are like death,

00:56:28.369 --> 00:56:32.809
so that Don Quixote dies and is
resurrected as Alonso Quijano.

00:56:32.809 --> 00:56:36.751
Borges remarks on the sort of
what calls "lateral and

00:56:36.751 --> 00:56:39.862
casual way,"
in which Don Quixote dies at

00:56:39.862 --> 00:56:41.659
the end of a sentence.
 

00:56:41.659 --> 00:56:43.760
If you have followed the
ending, there it's sort of at

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.664
the end of the sentence but,
"I mean that he

00:56:45.664 --> 00:56:48.875
died";
"Quiero decir que...

00:56:48.875 --> 00:56:51.125
murió;
and he writes:

00:56:51.125 --> 00:56:54.266
"It is the last of many
cruelties that Cervantes has

00:56:54.266 --> 00:56:55.670
visited upon his hero.
 

00:56:55.670 --> 00:57:03.076
Perhaps this cruelty is a form
of modesty and Cervantes and Don

00:57:03.076 --> 00:57:09.047
Quixote understand each other
well and forgive each

00:57:09.047 --> 00:57:10.960
other."
 

00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:13.309
Writes Borges.
 

00:57:13.309 --> 00:57:17.887
Borges claims that the whole
book was written for this last

00:57:17.887 --> 00:57:19.230
scene of death.
 

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:27.224
I am going to finish with the
image that you have on the title

00:57:27.224 --> 00:57:34.525
page of your syllabus which is,
of course, the one by Pablo

00:57:34.525 --> 00:57:36.496
Picasso,
whom you all know,

00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:38.280
of course, was a Spanish
painter,

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.456
although he lived in France
most of his life and all of

00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:43.206
that,
but he was a Spanish painter

00:57:43.206 --> 00:57:48.719
born in Málaga in 1881,
and died in 1973.

00:57:48.719 --> 00:57:50.489
I left Picasso for last.
 

00:57:50.489 --> 00:57:53.869
His Quixote,
as I said, and as you know,

00:57:53.869 --> 00:57:56.809
is on the title page of your
syllabus.

00:57:56.809 --> 00:58:01.273
I think that Picasso's
Quixote is so schematic

00:58:01.273 --> 00:58:06.079
because he considers him an
archetype, and archetypes are

00:58:06.079 --> 00:58:08.139
schematic by nature.
 

00:58:08.139 --> 00:58:13.717
Notice, of course,
the skeletal Rocinante,

00:58:13.717 --> 00:58:18.751
is made up of lines,
the plump Sancho,

00:58:18.751 --> 00:58:22.289
and the donkey's ears.
 

00:58:22.289 --> 00:58:29.860
I think that the donkey's ears
are their signature,

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:31.139
and in Spanish
"burro"

00:58:31.139 --> 00:58:32.925
means a "donkey,"
and it means someone who's

00:58:32.925 --> 00:58:33.230
dumb.
 

00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:35.150
So you can, you know?
 

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:36.860
You point ears like and it
says, you're a donkey.

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:40.360
So this is why the donkey's
ears are so prominent.

00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.704
Picasso has injected some humor
in his painting,

00:58:43.704 --> 00:58:46.340
which I think is quite
appropriate.

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:49.679
The windmills in the background
are Don Quixote's signature,

00:58:49.679 --> 00:58:58.119
and the bright sun beating down
on him is Castile's hot sun,

00:58:58.119 --> 00:59:00.900
which is present through much
of the novel,

00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.300
but what is not so evident,
it seems to me,

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:09.920
until you look for a while,
is that Don Quixote's figure is

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:15.500
like an interrogation mark;
the figure of Don Quixote is

00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:20.186
like an interrogation mark,
a question mark,

00:59:20.186 --> 00:59:24.010
in English, I'm sorry,
I'm translating from Spanish,

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:25.833
"punto de
interrogación,"

00:59:25.833 --> 00:59:26.480
question mark.
 

00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.989
Your languages tend to get
mixed up;

00:59:28.989 --> 00:59:33.081
there are advantages and
disadvantages to knowing several

00:59:33.081 --> 00:59:33.960
languages.
 

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:36.440
So I'll leave you with that
question mark of Picasso's.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:42.000

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.912
Professor Donald
Kagan: Now,

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:05.960
I'm going to ask you this
question.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.865
Why are you here?
That is to say,

00:00:10.865 --> 00:00:14.278
why should you,
we, all of us,

00:00:14.278 --> 00:00:18.750
want to study these ancient
Greeks?

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.657
I think it's reasonable for
people who are considering the

00:00:22.657 --> 00:00:27.045
study of a particular subject in
a college course to ask why they

00:00:27.045 --> 00:00:29.729
should.
What is it about the Greeks

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:33.589
between the years that I
mentioned to you that deserves

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.520
the attention of people in the
twenty-first century?

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.267
I think the answer is to be
found, or at least one

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:45.855
answer--the truth is there are
many answers--in that they are

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:50.168
just terribly interesting,
but that's very much of

00:00:50.168 --> 00:00:53.766
a--what's the word I want,
the opposite of

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:57.540
objective--subjective
observation by me.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.775
So I would say,
a less subjective one is that I

00:01:00.775 --> 00:01:03.869
believe that it comes from their
position,

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:07.187
that is to say,
the position of the Greeks are

00:01:07.187 --> 00:01:11.980
at the most significant starting
point of Western Civilization,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.476
which is the culture that most
powerfully shapes not only the

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.099
West but most of the world
today.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:24.015
It seems to me to be evident
that whatever it's other

00:01:24.015 --> 00:01:27.417
characteristics,
the West has created

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:33.088
institutions of government and
law that provide unprecedented

00:01:33.088 --> 00:01:38.536
freedom for its people.
It has also invented a body of

00:01:38.536 --> 00:01:44.129
natural scientific knowledge and
technological achievement that

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:48.820
together make possible a level
of health and material

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.970
prosperity undreamed of in
earlier times,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.938
and unknown outside the West
and those places that have been

00:01:56.938 --> 00:02:01.166
influenced by the West.
I think the Nobel Prize

00:02:01.166 --> 00:02:05.152
laureate, V.S.
Naipaul, a man born in

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:11.685
Trinidad, of Indian parents,
was right, when he spoke of the

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:18.218
modern world as our universal
civilization shaped chiefly by

00:02:18.218 --> 00:02:21.933
the West.
Most people around the

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:26.568
world who know of them want to
benefit from the achievements of

00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:31.665
Western science and technology.
Many of them also want to

00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:35.550
participate in its political
freedom.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.658
Moreover, experience suggests
that a society cannot achieve

00:02:40.658 --> 00:02:45.943
the full benefits of Western
science and technology without a

00:02:45.943 --> 00:02:50.435
commitment to reason and
objectivity as essential to

00:02:50.435 --> 00:02:55.543
knowledge and to the political
freedom that sustains it and

00:02:55.543 --> 00:03:00.789
helps it to move forward.
The primacy of reason and the

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:05.065
pursuit of objectivity,
therefore, both characteristic

00:03:05.065 --> 00:03:09.824
of the Western experience seem
to me to be essential for the

00:03:09.824 --> 00:03:15.229
achievement of the desired goals
almost anywhere in the world.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:18.408
The civilization of the
West, however,

00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:22.905
was not the result of some
inevitable process through which

00:03:22.905 --> 00:03:26.240
other cultures will
automatically pass.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.073
It emerged from a unique
history in which chance and

00:03:31.073 --> 00:03:34.580
accident often played a vital
part.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.492
The institutions and the ideas
therefore, that provide for

00:03:38.492 --> 00:03:42.680
freedom and improvement in the
material conditions of life,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.204
cannot take root and flourish
without an understanding of how

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:51.049
they came about and what
challenges they have had to

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.158
surmount.
Non-Western peoples who wish to

00:03:54.158 --> 00:03:58.003
share in the things that
characterize modernity will need

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:01.847
to study the ideas and history
of Western civilization to

00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:04.800
achieve what they want and
Westerners,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.684
I would argue,
who wish to preserve these

00:04:08.684 --> 00:04:13.499
things must do the same.
The many civilizations

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:18.870
adopted by the human race have
shared basic characteristics.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.104
Most have tended toward
cultural uniformity and

00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:27.141
stability.
Reason, although it was

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:30.848
employed for all sorts of
practical and intellectual

00:04:30.848 --> 00:04:33.610
purposes in some of these
cultures,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.828
it still lacked independence
from religion and it lacked the

00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:43.870
high status to challenge the
most basic received ideas.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.750
Standard form of government has
been monarchy.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.819
Outside the West,
republics have been unknown.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.512
Rulers have been thought to be
divine or appointed spokesmen

00:04:59.512 --> 00:05:02.873
for divinity.
Religious and political

00:05:02.873 --> 00:05:07.948
institutions and beliefs have
been thoroughly intertwined as a

00:05:07.948 --> 00:05:11.360
mutually supportive unified
structure.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.410
Government has not been subject
to secular reasoned analysis.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.133
It has rested on religious
authority, tradition,

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:25.725
and power.
The concept of individual

00:05:25.725 --> 00:05:31.163
freedom has had no importance in
these great majorities of

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:36.203
cultures in human history.
The first and the sharpest

00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:40.925
break with this common human
experience came in ancient

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:43.702
Greece.
The Greek city states called

00:05:43.702 --> 00:05:48.498
poleis were republics.
The differences in wealth among

00:05:48.498 --> 00:05:51.879
their citizens were relatively
small.

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.536
There were no kings with the
wealth to hire mercenary

00:05:55.536 --> 00:05:58.900
soldiers.
So the citizens had to do their

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.410
own fighting and to decide when
to fight.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.438
As independent defenders of the
common safety and the common

00:06:06.438 --> 00:06:10.604
interest, they demanded a role
in the most important political

00:06:10.604 --> 00:06:12.532
decisions.
In this way,

00:06:12.532 --> 00:06:16.097
for the first time,
political life really was

00:06:16.097 --> 00:06:18.335
invented.
Observe that the word

00:06:18.335 --> 00:06:21.589
"political" derives from the
Greek word polis.

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:26.079
Before that no word was needed
because there was no such thing.

00:06:26.079 --> 00:06:30.248
This political life came to be
shared by a relatively large

00:06:30.248 --> 00:06:34.272
portion of the people and
participation of political life

00:06:34.272 --> 00:06:37.867
was highly valued by the Greeks.
Such states,

00:06:37.867 --> 00:06:42.403
of course, did not need a
bureaucracy for there were no

00:06:42.403 --> 00:06:47.274
vast royal or state holdings
that needed management and not

00:06:47.274 --> 00:06:52.230
much economic surplus to support
a bureaucratic class.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.093
There was no separate caste of
priests and there was very

00:06:56.093 --> 00:06:59.060
little concern,
I don't mean any concern,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.305
but very little concern with
life after death which was

00:07:03.305 --> 00:07:07.000
universally important in other
civilizations.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.436
In this varied,
dynamic, secular,

00:07:10.436 --> 00:07:15.973
and remarkably free context,
there arose for the first time

00:07:15.973 --> 00:07:22.560
a speculative natural philosophy
based on observation and reason,

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:28.339
the root of modern natural
science and philosophy,

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:33.529
free to investigate or to
ignore divinity.

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:38.350
What most sets the Greeks apart
is their view of the world.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.646
Where other peoples have seen
sameness and continuity,

00:07:41.646 --> 00:07:44.879
the Greeks and the heirs of
their way of thinking,

00:07:44.879 --> 00:07:49.417
have tended to notice
disjunctions and to make

00:07:49.417 --> 00:07:52.683
distinctions.
The Greek way of looking at

00:07:52.683 --> 00:07:56.191
things requires a change from
the characteristic way of

00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:58.529
knowing things before the
Greeks,

00:07:58.529 --> 00:08:02.352
that is to say,
the use of faith,

00:08:02.352 --> 00:08:07.243
poetry, and intuition.
Instead, increasingly,

00:08:07.243 --> 00:08:11.290
the Greeks focused on a
reliance on reason.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:17.673
Reason permits a continuing
rational inquiry into the nature

00:08:17.673 --> 00:08:21.301
of reality.
Unlike mystical insights,

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:26.545
scientific theories cannot be
arrived at by meditation alone

00:08:26.545 --> 00:08:32.144
but require accurate observation
of the world and reasoning of a

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:36.410
kind that other human beings can
criticize,

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:43.980
analyze, modify, and correct.
The adoption of this way of

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.763
thinking was the beginning of
the liberation and enthronement

00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:52.269
of reason to whose searching
examination,

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:57.648
the Greeks thereafter,
exposed everything they

00:08:57.648 --> 00:09:02.309
perceived natural,
human, and divine.

00:09:02.309 --> 00:09:06.722
From the time they formed their
republics until they were

00:09:06.722 --> 00:09:10.740
conquered by alien empires,
the Greeks also rejected

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.809
monarchy of any kind.
They thought that a human being

00:09:15.809 --> 00:09:21.909
functioning in his full capacity
must live as a free man in an

00:09:21.909 --> 00:09:28.009
autonomous polis ruled by
laws that were the product of

00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:34.110
the political community and not
of an arbitrary fiat from some

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:38.318
man or god.
These are ideas about laws and

00:09:38.318 --> 00:09:42.974
justice that have simply not
flourished outside the Western

00:09:42.974 --> 00:09:47.870
tradition until places that were
outside the Western tradition

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.011
were influenced by the West.
The Greeks, however,

00:09:52.011 --> 00:09:55.962
combined a unique sense of
mankind's high place in the

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:58.771
natural order.
The Greeks had the most

00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:02.189
arrogant view of their
relationship to the divinity,

00:10:02.189 --> 00:10:05.137
as I will tell you about later
in the course,

00:10:05.137 --> 00:10:08.021
of any people I know.
So on the one hand,

00:10:08.021 --> 00:10:11.146
they had this very high picture
of this place of man,

00:10:11.146 --> 00:10:13.250
but they combined it--excuse
me,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:18.499
and what possibilities these
human beings had before

00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:23.851
that--with a painful
understanding of the limitations

00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:29.409
of the greatness and the
possibilities before man.

00:10:29.409 --> 00:10:33.941
This combination of
elevating the greatness in

00:10:33.941 --> 00:10:38.565
reality and in possibility of
human beings with the

00:10:38.565 --> 00:10:43.731
limitations of it,
the greatest limitation being

00:10:43.731 --> 00:10:46.204
mortality;
that together,

00:10:46.204 --> 00:10:51.068
composes the tragic vision of
the human condition that

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:55.289
characterized classical Greek
civilization.

00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:59.116
To cope with it,
they urged human beings to

00:10:59.116 --> 00:11:02.669
restrain their overarching
ambitions.

00:11:02.669 --> 00:11:08.259
Inscribed at Apollo's temple at
Delphi, which becameâ€“well,

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:13.139
the Greeks came to call it the
navel of the universe,

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:16.900
but it certainly became the
center of the Greek world--and

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.463
which was also seen as a central
place of importance by

00:11:20.463 --> 00:11:24.289
non-Greeks who were on the
borders of the Greek world.

00:11:24.289 --> 00:11:29.678
That temple at Delphi had
written above the Temple these

00:11:29.678 --> 00:11:33.988
words, "Know Thyself," and
another statement,

00:11:33.988 --> 00:11:39.034
"Nothing in Excess."
I think those together really

00:11:39.034 --> 00:11:44.237
mean this: know your own
limitations as a fallible mortal

00:11:44.237 --> 00:11:49.720
and then exercise moderation
because you are not divine,

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.216
you are mortal.
Beyond these exhortations,

00:11:54.216 --> 00:11:59.016
they relied on a good political
regime to enable human beings to

00:11:59.016 --> 00:12:03.360
fulfill the capacities that were
part of their nature,

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:09.539
to train them in virtue,
and to restrain them from vice.

00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:13.139
Aristotle, and his politics,
made the point neatly,

00:12:13.139 --> 00:12:15.299
and I quote him,
"As a man,"

00:12:15.299 --> 00:12:18.608
- I'm sorry,
"As man is the best of the

00:12:18.608 --> 00:12:22.612
animals when perfected,
so he is the worst when

00:12:22.612 --> 00:12:28.450
separated from law and justice.
For injustice is most dangerous

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:33.759
when it is armed and man armed
by nature with good sense and

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:38.259
virtue may use them for entirely
opposite ends.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:42.198
Therefore, when he is without
virtue, man is the most

00:12:42.198 --> 00:12:45.380
unscrupulous and savage of the
animals."

00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:52.644
Aristotle went on to say that
the justice needed to control

00:12:52.644 --> 00:12:56.777
this dark side of human nature
can be found only in a well

00:12:56.777 --> 00:13:00.909
ordered society of free people
who govern themselves,

00:13:00.909 --> 00:13:05.950
and the only one that he knew
was the polis of the

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.816
Greeks.
Now, the second great

00:13:08.816 --> 00:13:13.340
strand in the history of the
West is the Judeo Christian

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.669
tradition,
a very different tradition from

00:13:16.669 --> 00:13:21.360
the one I have just described.
Christianity's main roots were

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:25.330
in Judaism, a religion that
worshipped a single,

00:13:25.330 --> 00:13:29.654
all powerful deity,
who is sharply separated from

00:13:29.654 --> 00:13:33.529
human beings,
makes great moral demands upon

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:36.535
them,
and judges them all,

00:13:36.535 --> 00:13:41.158
even kings and emperors.
Christianity began as a

00:13:41.158 --> 00:13:45.485
persecuted religion that
ultimately captured the Roman

00:13:45.485 --> 00:13:50.629
Empire only after centuries of
hostility towards the Empire,

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:53.966
towards Rome,
towards the secular state in

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:57.009
general.
It never lost entirely its

00:13:57.009 --> 00:14:00.696
original character as an
insurgent movement,

00:14:00.696 --> 00:14:04.639
independent of the state and
hostile to it,

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:08.110
making claims that challenge
the secular authority.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.805
This, too, is unique to the
West, just like the Greek

00:14:11.805 --> 00:14:15.509
experience is unique.
This kind of religious

00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:21.059
organization is to be found
nowhere else in human society.

00:14:21.059 --> 00:14:25.193
So the union of a
universalist religion,

00:14:25.193 --> 00:14:29.230
with a monarch such as the
Roman Empire,

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:34.260
who ruled a vast empire,
could nonetheless have put an

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.860
end to any prospect of freedom
as in other civilizations.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:45.649
But Christianity's inheritance
of the rational disputatious

00:14:45.649 --> 00:14:50.740
Greek philosophy led to
powerfully divisive quarrels

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:56.730
about the nature of God and
other theological questions,

00:14:56.730 --> 00:15:00.903
which was perfectly in the
tradition and uniquely in the

00:15:00.903 --> 00:15:04.090
tradition of Greek philosophical
debate.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.838
What I am doing is making a
claim that even the

00:15:06.838 --> 00:15:10.124
Judeo-Christian tradition,
which is such a different one

00:15:10.124 --> 00:15:13.713
from the Greeks,
and in so many ways seems to be

00:15:13.713 --> 00:15:17.187
at odds with it,
even they were dependent upon

00:15:17.187 --> 00:15:21.643
one aspect of the Greek culture,
which is inherent in

00:15:21.643 --> 00:15:25.500
Christianity and important in
Christianity.

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.769
That too, was ultimately,
a Greek source.

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:32.186
Well, the people who the
Romans called barbarians

00:15:32.186 --> 00:15:36.325
destroyed the Western empire and
it also the destroyed the power

00:15:36.325 --> 00:15:40.004
of the emperors and their
efforts to impose religious and

00:15:40.004 --> 00:15:43.289
political conformity under
imperial control.

00:15:43.289 --> 00:15:46.344
The emperor in the east was
able to do that because they

00:15:46.344 --> 00:15:48.509
were not conquered by the
barbarians,

00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:52.473
but in the West,
you have this situation where

00:15:52.473 --> 00:15:56.996
nobody is fully in charge.
Here we have arrived at a

00:15:56.996 --> 00:16:01.850
second sharp break with the
general experience of mankind.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:06.955
The West of the Germanic tribes
that had toppled the Roman

00:16:06.955 --> 00:16:10.269
Empire was weak and it was
divided.

00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:15.425
The barriers to unity presented
by European geography and very

00:16:15.425 --> 00:16:20.327
limited technology made it hard
for a would-be conqueror to

00:16:20.327 --> 00:16:24.778
create a vast empire,
eliminating competitors and

00:16:24.778 --> 00:16:27.809
imposing his will over vast
areas.

00:16:27.809 --> 00:16:32.428
These conditions permitted a
development of institutions and

00:16:32.428 --> 00:16:36.626
habits needed for freedom,
even as they also made Europe

00:16:36.626 --> 00:16:40.500
vulnerable to conquests and to
extinction, and Europe was

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.720
almost extinguished practically
before there was a Europe;

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:50.037
very early in its history.
The Christian Church might

00:16:50.037 --> 00:16:53.725
have stepped into the breach and
imposed obedience and

00:16:53.725 --> 00:16:57.217
uniformity,
because before terribly long,

00:16:57.217 --> 00:17:00.690
all of the West had been
Christianized.

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.867
But the Church,
in fact, never gained enough

00:17:03.867 --> 00:17:08.158
power to control the state.
Strong enough to interfere with

00:17:08.158 --> 00:17:12.039
the ambitions of emperors and
kings, it never was able to

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:16.587
impose its own domination,
though some of the Popes surely

00:17:16.587 --> 00:17:19.482
tried.
Nobody sought or planned for

00:17:19.482 --> 00:17:24.045
freedom, but in the spaces that
were left by the endless

00:17:24.045 --> 00:17:29.519
conflicts among secular rulers
and between them and the Church,

00:17:29.519 --> 00:17:33.940
there was room for freedom to
grow.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.105
Freedom was a kind of an
accident that came about because

00:17:38.105 --> 00:17:41.900
the usual ways of doing things
were not possible.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:47.824
Into some of that space,
towns and cities reappeared and

00:17:47.824 --> 00:17:51.809
with them new supports for
freedom.

00:17:51.809 --> 00:17:54.788
Taking advantage of the
rivalries I've mentioned,

00:17:54.788 --> 00:17:58.636
they obtained charters from the
local powers establishing their

00:17:58.636 --> 00:18:01.615
rights to conduct their own
affairs and to govern

00:18:01.615 --> 00:18:03.504
themselves.
In Italy,

00:18:03.504 --> 00:18:06.844
some of these cities were able
to gain control of the

00:18:06.844 --> 00:18:09.734
surrounding country and to
become city states,

00:18:09.734 --> 00:18:12.559
resembling those of the ancient
Greeks.

00:18:12.559 --> 00:18:17.841
Their autonomy was assisted by
the continuing struggle between

00:18:17.841 --> 00:18:21.791
Popes and Emperors,
between church and state,

00:18:21.791 --> 00:18:25.799
again, a thoroughly unique
Western experience.

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:29.584
In these states,
the modern world began to take

00:18:29.584 --> 00:18:32.480
form.
Although the people were mainly

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.446
Christians, their life and
outlook became increasingly

00:18:36.446 --> 00:18:39.608
secular.
Here, and not only in Italy but

00:18:39.608 --> 00:18:43.832
in other cities north of the
Alps, arose a worldview that

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:47.680
celebrated the greatness and
dignity of mankind,

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:52.747
which was a very sharp turning
away from the medieval Western

00:18:52.747 --> 00:18:57.899
tradition that put God and life
in the hereafter at the center

00:18:57.899 --> 00:19:01.992
of everything.
This new vision is revealed

00:19:01.992 --> 00:19:06.890
with flamboyant confidence by
Pico della Mirándola,

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:12.500
a Florentine thinker,
who said--wrote the following:

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.243
"God told man that we,
meaning God,

00:19:16.243 --> 00:19:20.289
have made the neither of Heaven
nor of Earth,

00:19:20.289 --> 00:19:25.779
neither mortal nor immortal,
so that with freedom of choice

00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:29.738
and with honor,
as though the maker and molder

00:19:29.738 --> 00:19:33.688
of thyself,
thou mayest fashion thyself in

00:19:33.688 --> 00:19:36.769
whatever shape thou shalt
prefer.

00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:42.943
Oh supreme generosity of God
the Father, oh highest and the

00:19:42.943 --> 00:19:49.586
most great felicity of man,
to Him it is granted to have

00:19:49.586 --> 00:19:55.430
whatever He chooses to be
whatever He wills."

00:19:55.430 --> 00:20:01.877
Now, this is a remarkable leap,
even beyond the humanism of the

00:20:01.877 --> 00:20:06.349
Greeks, something brand new in
the world.

00:20:06.349 --> 00:20:10.595
According to this view,
man is not merely the measure

00:20:10.595 --> 00:20:15.330
of all things as the Greek
Sophist Protagoras had radically

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:21.293
proclaimed in the fifth century.
He is, in fact says Pico,

00:20:21.293 --> 00:20:26.440
more than mortal.
He is unlimited by nature.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:32.618
He is entirely free to shape
himself and to acquire whatever

00:20:32.618 --> 00:20:36.373
he wants.
Please observe too that it is

00:20:36.373 --> 00:20:41.311
not his reason that will
determine human actions but his

00:20:41.311 --> 00:20:46.339
will alone, free of the
moderating control of reason.

00:20:46.339 --> 00:20:49.096
Another Florentine,
Machiavelli,

00:20:49.096 --> 00:20:52.089
moved further in the same
direction.

00:20:52.089 --> 00:20:57.789
For him, and I quote him,
"Fortune is a woman and it is

00:20:57.789 --> 00:21:04.440
necessary to hold her down and
beat her, and fight with her."

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.913
A notion that the Greeks would
have regarded as dangerously

00:21:08.913 --> 00:21:12.230
arrogant and certain to produce
disaster.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.246
They would have seen this as an
example of the word that they

00:21:15.246 --> 00:21:17.759
used, and we'll talk about a lot
in this course,

00:21:17.759 --> 00:21:21.070
hubris,
a kind of violent arrogance

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.673
which comes upon men when they
see themselves as more than

00:21:25.673 --> 00:21:29.549
human and behave as though they
were divine.

00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:32.867
Francis Bacon,
influenced by Machiavelli,

00:21:32.867 --> 00:21:37.759
urged human beings to employ
their reason to force nature to

00:21:37.759 --> 00:21:42.144
give up its secrets,
to treat nature like a woman,

00:21:42.144 --> 00:21:46.686
to master nature in order to
improve man's material well

00:21:46.686 --> 00:21:49.114
being.
He assumed that such a course

00:21:49.114 --> 00:21:52.714
would lead to progress and the
general improvement of the human

00:21:52.714 --> 00:21:55.320
condition,
and it was that sort of

00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:00.309
thinking that lay at the heart
of the scientific revolution and

00:22:00.309 --> 00:22:04.735
remains the faith on which
modern science and technology

00:22:04.735 --> 00:22:07.442
rest.
A couple of other English

00:22:07.442 --> 00:22:10.002
political philosophers,
Hobbs and Locke,

00:22:10.002 --> 00:22:13.611
applied a similar novelty and
modernity to the sphere of

00:22:13.611 --> 00:22:16.813
politics.
Basing their understanding on

00:22:16.813 --> 00:22:21.616
the common passions of man for a
comfortable self-preservation

00:22:21.616 --> 00:22:26.420
and discovering something the
Greeks had never thought of,

00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.469
something they called natural
rights that belonged to a man

00:22:31.469 --> 00:22:36.623
either as part of nature,
or as the gift of a benevolent

00:22:36.623 --> 00:22:41.294
and a reasonable god.
Man was seen as a solitary

00:22:41.294 --> 00:22:45.720
creature, not inherently a part
of society.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:50.746
That is totally un-Greek.
And his basic rights were seen

00:22:50.746 --> 00:22:54.465
to be absolute,
for nothing must interfere with

00:22:54.465 --> 00:22:58.266
the right of each individual to
defend his life,

00:22:58.266 --> 00:23:02.772
liberty, and property.
Freedom was threatened in early

00:23:02.772 --> 00:23:07.491
modern times by the emergence of
monarchies that might have been

00:23:07.491 --> 00:23:11.044
able to crush it.
But the cause of individual

00:23:11.044 --> 00:23:15.000
freedom was enhanced by the
Protestant Reformation.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.556
Another upheaval within
Christianity arising from its

00:23:19.556 --> 00:23:24.780
focus on individual salvation,
its inheritance of a tradition

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:28.654
of penetrating reason,
applied even to matters of

00:23:28.654 --> 00:23:33.012
faith and to the continuing
struggle between church and

00:23:33.012 --> 00:23:36.438
state.
The English Revolution came

00:23:36.438 --> 00:23:40.123
about, in large part,
because of King Charles'

00:23:40.123 --> 00:23:44.299
attempt to impose an alien
religious conformity,

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:49.180
as well as tighter political
control on his kingdom.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.382
But in England,
the tradition of freedom and

00:23:52.382 --> 00:23:56.777
government bound by law was
already strong enough to produce

00:23:56.777 --> 00:24:01.241
effective resistance.
From the ensuing rebellion came

00:24:01.241 --> 00:24:05.521
limited constitutional
representative government and

00:24:05.521 --> 00:24:09.130
ultimately our modern form of
democracy.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:11.899
The example,
and the ideas it produced,

00:24:11.899 --> 00:24:15.543
encouraged and informed the
French and the American

00:24:15.543 --> 00:24:18.416
Revolutions,
and the entire modern

00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:23.172
constitutional tradition.
These ideas and institutions

00:24:23.172 --> 00:24:28.458
are the basis for modern liberal
thinking about politics,

00:24:28.458 --> 00:24:33.373
the individual and society.
Just as the confident view of

00:24:33.373 --> 00:24:37.539
science and technology has
progressive forces improving the

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:41.992
lot of humanity and increasing
man's capacity to understand and

00:24:41.992 --> 00:24:46.607
control the universe,
has been the most powerful form

00:24:46.607 --> 00:24:50.329
taken by the Western elevation
of reason.

00:24:50.329 --> 00:24:55.550
In the last two centuries,
both these most characteristic

00:24:55.550 --> 00:25:01.118
elements of Western civilization
have in fact become increasingly

00:25:01.118 --> 00:25:04.654
under heavy attack.
At different times,

00:25:04.654 --> 00:25:09.338
science and technology have
been blamed for the destruction

00:25:09.338 --> 00:25:14.022
of human community and the
alienation of people from nature

00:25:14.022 --> 00:25:18.464
and from one another - for
intensifying the gulf between

00:25:18.464 --> 00:25:22.122
rich and poor,
for threatening the very

00:25:22.122 --> 00:25:26.374
existence of humanity,
either by producing weapons of

00:25:26.374 --> 00:25:30.789
total destruction or by
destroying the environment.

00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:35.103
At the same time,
the foundations of freedom have

00:25:35.103 --> 00:25:40.087
also come into question.
Jefferson and his colleagues

00:25:40.087 --> 00:25:45.951
could confidently proclaim their
political rights as being self

00:25:45.951 --> 00:25:49.450
evident and the gift of a
creator.

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:53.719
By now, in our time,
however, the power of religion

00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:58.244
has faded, and for many,
the basis of modern political

00:25:58.244 --> 00:26:01.660
and moral order has been
demolished.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:06.932
Nietzsche announced the
death of God and Dostoyevsky's

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:12.575
Grand Inquisitor asserted that
when God is dead all things are

00:26:12.575 --> 00:26:16.860
permitted.
Nihilism rejects any objective

00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:20.450
basis for society and its
morality.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.740
It rejects the very concept of
objectivity.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.317
It even rejects the possibility
of communication itself,

00:26:29.317 --> 00:26:34.294
and a vulgar form of Nihilism,
I claim, has a remarkable

00:26:34.294 --> 00:26:38.089
influence in our educational
system today,

00:26:38.089 --> 00:26:41.700
a system rotting from the head
down,

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:45.770
so chiefly in universities,
but all the way down to

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:49.935
elementary schools.
The consequences of the victory

00:26:49.935 --> 00:26:53.500
of such ideas,
I believe, would be enormous.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:27:00.221
If both religion and reason are
removed, all that remains is

00:27:00.221 --> 00:27:05.233
will and power,
where the only law is the law

00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:09.818
of tooth and claw.
There is no protection for

00:27:09.818 --> 00:27:13.004
the freedom of weaker
individuals, or those who

00:27:13.004 --> 00:27:16.259
question the authority of the
most powerful.

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:19.738
There is no basis for
individual rights,

00:27:19.738 --> 00:27:24.375
or for a critique of existing
ideas and institutions,

00:27:24.375 --> 00:27:29.369
if there is no base either in
religion or in reason.

00:27:29.369 --> 00:27:32.746
That such attacks on the
greatest achievements of the

00:27:32.746 --> 00:27:36.577
West should be made by Western
intellectuals is perfectly in

00:27:36.577 --> 00:27:39.109
keeping with the Western
tradition.

00:27:39.109 --> 00:27:42.427
The first crowd to do stuff
like that, you will find,

00:27:42.427 --> 00:27:46.255
in the fifth century B.C.
in Greece is a movement called

00:27:46.255 --> 00:27:49.885
The Sophistic Movement.
These Sophists raised most of

00:27:49.885 --> 00:27:54.113
the questions that my colleagues
are now spending all their time

00:27:54.113 --> 00:27:57.202
with.
Yet, to me, it seems ironic

00:27:57.202 --> 00:28:01.930
that they have gained so much
currency in a time,

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:05.649
more or less,
in which the achievements of

00:28:05.649 --> 00:28:11.183
Western reason in the form of
science and at a moment when its

00:28:11.183 --> 00:28:16.355
concept of political freedom
seemed to be more popular and

00:28:16.355 --> 00:28:22.070
more desirable to people in and
out of Western civilization than

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.339
ever.
Now, I've been saying kind

00:28:25.339 --> 00:28:27.637
things about Western
civilization,

00:28:27.637 --> 00:28:31.815
but I would not want to deny
that there is a dark side to the

00:28:31.815 --> 00:28:34.880
Western experience and its way
of life.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:40.638
To put untrammeled reasons and
individual freedom at the center

00:28:40.638 --> 00:28:45.190
of a civilization is to live
with the conflict,

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:47.773
the turmoil,
the instability,

00:28:47.773 --> 00:28:52.109
and the uncertainty that these
things create.

00:28:52.109 --> 00:28:57.632
Freedom was born and has
survived in the space created by

00:28:57.632 --> 00:29:02.859
divisions, and conflict within
and between nations and

00:29:02.859 --> 00:29:06.724
religions.
We must wonder whether the

00:29:06.724 --> 00:29:11.789
power of modern weapons will
allow it and the world to

00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:15.525
survive at such a price.
Individual freedom,

00:29:15.525 --> 00:29:18.686
although it has greatly
elevated the condition of the

00:29:18.686 --> 00:29:21.299
people who have lived in free
societies,

00:29:21.299 --> 00:29:25.936
inevitably permits inequalities
which are the more galling,

00:29:25.936 --> 00:29:30.413
because each person is plainly
free to try to improve his

00:29:30.413 --> 00:29:34.730
situation and largely
responsible for the outcome.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:39.949
Freedom does permit isolation
from society and an alienation

00:29:39.949 --> 00:29:45.168
of the individual at a high
cost, both to the individual and

00:29:45.168 --> 00:29:48.049
society.
These are not the only

00:29:48.049 --> 00:29:52.109
problems posed by the Western
tradition in its modern form,

00:29:52.109 --> 00:29:56.522
which is what we live in.
Whether it takes the shape of

00:29:56.522 --> 00:30:00.750
the unbridled claims of Pico
della Mirandola or the

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:05.823
Nietzschean assertion of the
power of the superior individual

00:30:05.823 --> 00:30:09.460
to transform and shape his own
nature,

00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:15.743
or of the modern totalitarian
effort to change the nature of

00:30:15.743 --> 00:30:20.109
humanity by utopian social
engineering,

00:30:20.109 --> 00:30:25.951
the temptation to arrogance
offered by the ideas and worldly

00:30:25.951 --> 00:30:30.801
success of the modern West
threatens its own great

00:30:30.801 --> 00:30:35.419
traditions and achievements.
Because of Western

00:30:35.419 --> 00:30:39.766
civilization's emergence as the
exemplary civilization,

00:30:39.766 --> 00:30:43.630
it also presents problems to
the whole world.

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:47.771
The challenges presented by
freedom and the predominance of

00:30:47.771 --> 00:30:51.906
reason cannot be ignored,
nor can they be met by recourse

00:30:51.906 --> 00:30:55.179
to the experience of other
cultures where these

00:30:55.179 --> 00:30:58.240
characteristics have not been
prominent.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:01.486
In other words,
to understand and cope with the

00:31:01.486 --> 00:31:05.156
problems that we all face,
we all need to know and to

00:31:05.156 --> 00:31:07.980
grapple with the Western
experience.

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:11.658
In my view,
we need especially to examine

00:31:11.658 --> 00:31:17.259
the older traditions of the West
that came before the modern era,

00:31:17.259 --> 00:31:22.000
and to take seriously the
possibility that useful wisdom

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.620
can be found there,
especially among the Greeks who

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.447
began it all.
They understood the

00:31:29.447 --> 00:31:33.873
potentiality of human beings,
their limitations and the

00:31:33.873 --> 00:31:39.087
predicament in which they live.
Man is potent and important,

00:31:39.087 --> 00:31:43.682
yet he is fallible and mortal,
capable of the greatest

00:31:43.682 --> 00:31:46.890
achievements and the worst
crimes.

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:50.919
He is then a tragic figure,
powerful but limited,

00:31:50.919 --> 00:31:55.871
with freedom to choose and act,
but bound by his own nature,

00:31:55.871 --> 00:32:00.155
knowing that he will never
achieve perfect knowledge and

00:32:00.155 --> 00:32:03.526
understanding,
justice and happiness,

00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:08.549
but determined to continue the
search no matter what.

00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:12.768
To me that seems an
accurate description of the

00:32:12.768 --> 00:32:15.890
human condition that is
meaningful,

00:32:15.890 --> 00:32:19.571
not only for the Greeks and
their heirs in the West,

00:32:19.571 --> 00:32:23.496
but for all human beings.
It is an understanding that

00:32:23.496 --> 00:32:27.449
cannot be achieved without a
serious examination of the

00:32:27.449 --> 00:32:31.767
Western experience.
The abandonment of such a study

00:32:31.767 --> 00:32:37.008
or its adulteration for current
political purposes would be a

00:32:37.008 --> 00:32:40.240
terrible loss for all of
humanity,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.063
and at the base,
at the root of that

00:32:44.063 --> 00:32:49.926
civilization stood the Greeks.
These are the reasons why I

00:32:49.926 --> 00:32:55.449
examined their experience and I
trust why you are thinking about

00:32:55.449 --> 00:32:58.490
learning about it.
Thank you.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.195
I'll see you guys,
some of you,

00:33:01.195 --> 00:33:02.195
next Tuesday.

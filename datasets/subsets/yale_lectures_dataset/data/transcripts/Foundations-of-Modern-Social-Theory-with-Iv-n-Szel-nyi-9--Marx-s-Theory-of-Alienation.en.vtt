00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.626
Prof: Okay,
so now we move into the

00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:08.150
nineteenth century.
 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:14.619
It's unclear how long this
nineteenth century lasted,

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:21.835
whether it lasted from 1789
until 1914, or 1815 until 1914.

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:23.080
Right?
 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.250
But it was a relatively long
century.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.250
And yeah, John Stuart Mill was
already twentieth century.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.590
But Karl Marx did get into the
middle of it;

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.890
he was born in 1818 and died in
'83.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.355
And I tried to find a picture
of Marx, what you may not have

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:50.080
seen, when he was still quite a
good-looking guy.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.240
All right, so a few words about
his family background.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.149
His father, Karl Heinrich--no,
no, Marx himself was born in

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.328
1818 in Trier,
Germany, and his father was

00:01:04.328 --> 00:01:06.876
Heinrich Marx,
who was actually a lawyer,

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:10.724
quite a successful lawyer,
but he was very much a man of

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:11.870
enlightenment.
 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.980
He liked Voltaire and brought
Marx up in the spirit of

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.970
liberalism and enlightenment.
 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.991
Voltaire and Rousseau and John
Stuart Mill, well these were the

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.340
guiding lights of the time.
 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.635
The paternal grandfather was
Marx Levy, who was a rabbi of

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:33.379
Trier.
 

00:01:33.379 --> 00:01:36.596
But he died early,
before Karl was born,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.720
and in fact his father
converted to Lutheranism.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.390
It did not matter much.
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420
He was not really religious.
 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.569
He was quite secular and Marx,
Karl Marx, brought up in a

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:53.739
secular family.
 

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.251
So I found you a picture of
Trier in the early nineteenth

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:57.879
century.
 

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:02.811
If you look hard,
you'll probably see somewhere

00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:09.137
young Karl walking around and
shopping in the marketplace of

00:02:09.137 --> 00:02:10.210
Trier.
 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.938
All right, his education.
 

00:02:12.938 --> 00:02:15.586
He attended,
of course, high school in

00:02:15.586 --> 00:02:16.158
Trier.
 

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:19.800
Then in '35 he was admitted to
the University of Bonn,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.120
where he studied Greek and
Roman mythology and history--

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.280
already became involved in
student politics.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.888
But he really was bored in Bonn
and was attracted to go to

00:02:36.888 --> 00:02:42.990
Berlin, which at that time was
becoming a fascinating place.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:49.960
And he was attending the
lectures of Bruno Bauer.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.990
Bruno Bauer was a disciple of
Georg Hegel.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.515
Bauer belonged to a group of
philosophers who called

00:02:58.515 --> 00:03:02.508
themselves "the Young
Hegelians."

00:03:02.508 --> 00:03:07.080
They were the radicals of their
time, and Marx already wanted to

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.468
be a radical;
he just did not know what kind

00:03:10.468 --> 00:03:13.229
of radical he will be or should
be.

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:18.840
In fact, he received his degree
from the University of Jena.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.004
I think I cracked already this
joke in the introductory

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:25.068
lecture,
because assumedly it was easier

00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:28.188
to get a degree from Jena than
Berlin,

00:03:28.188 --> 00:03:32.659
and Marx was more interested
already in philosophy and

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:35.360
radicalism than legal studies.
 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.770
But he got his degree.
 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.746
So here is Georg Hegel,
one of the most important

00:03:43.746 --> 00:03:50.720
philosophers of the eighteenth
and nineteenth century.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:58.730
He was a German philosopher;
and I will talk more when we

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.490
get into Marx's own work.
 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.538
He basically saw human history
as the unfolding of human

00:04:06.538 --> 00:04:11.288
consciousness,
and he also characterized the

00:04:11.288 --> 00:04:18.000
human condition as in the state
of alienation in which subject

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.949
and object were separated from
each other.

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.310
These are big words.
 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.730
You will get comfortable with
it as I'm lecturing on Marx.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.060
Because this is very important
for Hegelian philosophy--

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.764
also for Marxism,
the distinction that there is

00:04:36.764 --> 00:04:40.476
the subject,
yourself, who are observing,

00:04:40.476 --> 00:04:43.697
and the object,
the others or the material

00:04:43.697 --> 00:04:46.399
world upon which you are
reflecting.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:50.732
There is also another big word
you will learn in the next two

00:04:50.732 --> 00:04:54.269
or three lectures,
the word of totality;

00:04:54.269 --> 00:04:58.884
totality means when subject and
object are together in one

00:04:58.884 --> 00:05:02.528
unity, that's what is meant to
be totality.

00:05:02.528 --> 00:05:07.100
Now Hegel's idea was that
subject and object became

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.649
separated,
and the separation of subject

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:14.596
from object--
when there is seen as worth

00:05:14.596 --> 00:05:19.379
outside of the subject as a
separate object--

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:24.728
that is the state of alienation;
alien, to be a stranger,

00:05:24.728 --> 00:05:28.665
a stranger in the world,
because what is around you

00:05:28.665 --> 00:05:31.892
looks like strange,
as different from you.

00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:32.759
Right?
 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.850
That's what he meant by
alienation.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.990
But, you know,
human consciousness is

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.488
increasing, and as consciousness
is increasing you will overcome

00:05:43.488 --> 00:05:47.240
this separation of subject and
objects.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.160
Well, I'm sure it is not clear
for the time being,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.209
but we'll be laboring on this
in more detail with Marx,

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:57.709
and hopefully it will become a
little more clear.

00:05:57.709 --> 00:06:01.189
Bruno Bauer,
he is this charismatic

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:07.329
lecturer, the Young Hegelian
whose lectures Marx attended.

00:06:07.329 --> 00:06:12.060
And there is no Marx and
Marxism without Bruno Bauer;

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.161
though most of his work is
vitriolic criticism of Bruno

00:06:16.161 --> 00:06:16.769
Bauer.
 

00:06:16.769 --> 00:06:20.189
Well, Marx was quite a
vitriolic guy.

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:23.589
He liked to use overheated
language.

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:26.968
Occasionally it's very
beautiful, the language he's

00:06:26.968 --> 00:06:27.509
using.
 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:32.110
Occasionally this is pretty
outraging.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.720
Okay, what about Bauer and the
Left Hegelians?

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.259
As I said, you know,
he kind of comes--

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:49.209
he's a Hegel disciple,
but he tries to move beyond

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:56.254
Hegel and offer a critical
theory of Hegel and the Hegelian

00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:58.440
system itself.
 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.903
These guys, the Young
Hegelians--Bauer and his brother

00:07:04.903 --> 00:07:10.261
and others like Feuerbach,
called themselves "the

00:07:10.261 --> 00:07:11.879
critical critics."
 

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:17.192
This is a term which comes up
in Marx's work sometimes,

00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:19.259
ironically usually.
 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:21.139
Why was it so?
 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:26.430
Because Hegel is seen in modern
philosophy as the Founding

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.029
Father of critical theory.
 

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:34.619
You may have heard the word;
if you studied philosophy I'm

00:07:34.619 --> 00:07:37.050
sure you have heard the word.
 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.670
What is critical theory?
 

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:44.668
Well the essence of critical
theory is that it believes that

00:07:44.668 --> 00:07:50.600
the major task of philosophy,
to subject human consciousness

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:56.060
to critical scrutiny--
that there is some discrepancy

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.141
between human consciousness and
the human condition.

00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:02.040
Right?
 

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.922
Our consciousness does not
reflect properly the human

00:08:05.922 --> 00:08:10.550
condition, and therefore we have
to criticize consciousness and

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.939
get the right consciousness.
 

00:08:12.939 --> 00:08:17.610
Well who is actually the first
of critical theorists?

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.519
There is some controversy about
this.

00:08:19.519 --> 00:08:23.862
There are some people who
actually name Immanuel Kant,

00:08:23.862 --> 00:08:27.711
the German philosopher,
as the first of critical

00:08:27.711 --> 00:08:28.860
theorists.
 

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:34.506
Kant made a very interesting
distinction between Ding an

00:08:34.506 --> 00:08:38.500
sich and Ding fÃ¼r
sich;

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.379
things in themselves and things
for themselves.

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:48.880
And one important Kant idea was
that all the ideas what we have

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.519
in our mind are things for
themselves,

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:57.210
and they do not correspond to
the world around us.

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.774
The world around us is so rich
that the concepts what we

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:04.428
develop cannot completely fit.
 

00:09:04.428 --> 00:09:08.443
Therefore, in the act of
cognition--when we try to

00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:13.359
understand something--we select
from the world stuff which is

00:09:13.359 --> 00:09:15.080
important for us.
 

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.971
This is why it's things for
themselves.

00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:18.580
Right?
 

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.932
We select, in the process of
cognition, of learning,

00:09:22.932 --> 00:09:27.028
from the world elements what is
useful for us.

00:09:27.028 --> 00:09:30.884
So, I mean, in some ways
already Kant suggested that

00:09:30.884 --> 00:09:35.344
there is something problematic
with the human consciousness.

00:09:35.344 --> 00:09:36.100
Right?
 

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.100
We have to subject this human
consciousness to critical

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.133
scrutiny,
and to be aware that the

00:09:43.133 --> 00:09:48.400
unexhausted richness of the
world and reality cannot be ever

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.080
captured by the human mind.
 

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:56.181
Now others do see really Georg
Hegel as the real critical

00:09:56.181 --> 00:10:01.009
theorist, because now the
central point is alienation.

00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.918
Right?
 

00:10:01.918 --> 00:10:04.580
Here the central point is that
this is a big problem,

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:09.889
and unlike Kant,
who was an agnostic,

00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:14.258
he did not think we ever can
develop concepts which capture

00:10:14.258 --> 00:10:15.011
the world.
 

00:10:15.011 --> 00:10:15.690
Right?
 

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.114
Hegel believed that if you
guys, you learn my philosophy,

00:10:19.114 --> 00:10:20.458
you will be all right.
 

00:10:20.458 --> 00:10:21.009
Right?
 

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:24.048
Then you will overcome
alienation.

00:10:24.048 --> 00:10:26.720
You will get the appropriate
consciousness.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:28.649
Read my work.
 

00:10:28.649 --> 00:10:33.110
That was--you know,
to simplify it a great deal.

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:38.590
So anyway, he was seen as a
kind of critical theorist.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:43.298
Now, the Young Hegelians were
the critics of the critique.

00:10:43.298 --> 00:10:43.960
Right?
 

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:48.965
They wanted to apply Hegel's
critical method on Hegel's

00:10:48.965 --> 00:10:49.798
theory.
 

00:10:49.798 --> 00:10:54.990
They said, "Why on earth
Georg, Uncle Georg,

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.750
believes that his theory is the
right one?

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:03.518
Why don't we subject this
system itself to the same

00:11:03.518 --> 00:11:07.813
critical scrutiny what Hegel
suggests everything should be

00:11:07.813 --> 00:11:10.980
subjected to:
critical scrutiny?"

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.361
That is really the fundamental
line of argument that greatly

00:11:15.361 --> 00:11:16.700
influenced Marx.
 

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.168
Marx is, in many respects,
a critical critic.

00:11:20.168 --> 00:11:24.942
Now this is another Young
Hegelian, Ludwig Feuerbach,

00:11:24.942 --> 00:11:29.350
who had another very important
impact on Marx.

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:35.110
Feuerbach called his approach
"naturalism."

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.899
This is a term what Marx,
the young Marx,

00:11:38.899 --> 00:11:43.070
also used for a while to
describe himself.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:47.152
I think most of you in this
room would think that Marx was a

00:11:47.152 --> 00:11:50.851
materialist,
and eventually Marx used the

00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:54.559
term materialism,
and even more specifically,

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:58.048
historical materialism,
to describe what he was doing.

00:11:58.048 --> 00:12:03.710
But in his early work he was
shying away from materialism and

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.538
he used the term naturalism.
 

00:12:06.538 --> 00:12:10.964
And naturalism really meant
that you do not underestimate

00:12:10.964 --> 00:12:14.519
the importance of consciousness
in spirit,

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:18.058
just in the interaction with
consciousness and spirit,

00:12:18.058 --> 00:12:22.830
and the nature itself,--you pay
more attention to nature.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.940
Now Feuerbach's most important
book--

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.967
I don't think it is in
English--Das Wesen des

00:12:28.967 --> 00:12:31.701
Christentums,
The Essence of

00:12:31.701 --> 00:12:37.289
Christianity,
he also suggested that rather

00:12:37.289 --> 00:12:43.115
than God creating man,
man created the idea of God,

00:12:43.115 --> 00:12:46.450
and they created the idea of
God--

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:49.500
this is actually not all that
far from Bruno Bauer,

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.851
just a more radical position.
 

00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:52.418
Right?
 

00:12:52.418 --> 00:12:59.059
Because it wanted to project
the desperation of alienation

00:12:59.059 --> 00:13:01.740
into the idea of God.
 

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:07.953
So, I mean, while so to say
Bauer was not ready to draw the,

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:13.535
if I may use this term,
the ontological conclusions of

00:13:13.535 --> 00:13:16.379
his criticism of Hegel.
 

00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.755
Feuerbach went into ontology.
 

00:13:18.755 --> 00:13:19.330
Right?
 

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:24.764
Ontology means the origins of
things, and he believed that in

00:13:24.764 --> 00:13:30.288
fact the spiritual world is a
reflection of humans as such.

00:13:30.288 --> 00:13:33.403
That's why he called this
naturalism, as distinct from

00:13:33.403 --> 00:13:34.048
idealism.
 

00:13:34.048 --> 00:13:37.783
And we will talk about the
distinction between idealism and

00:13:37.783 --> 00:13:41.008
materialism,
or idealism as naturalism,

00:13:41.008 --> 00:13:44.308
which is very important for
Marxism,

00:13:44.308 --> 00:13:49.293
and has been an important
distinction in philosophy in the

00:13:49.293 --> 00:13:52.879
nineteenth and early twentieth
century.

00:13:52.879 --> 00:13:55.399
I don't think in the last,
you know,

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:58.620
fifty or a hundred years that,
you know,

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:00.582
in philosophy there is too much
discussion of idealism and

00:14:00.582 --> 00:14:03.113
materialism,
though I don't think it is

00:14:03.113 --> 00:14:07.408
quite a useless discussion,
who are idealist and who are

00:14:07.408 --> 00:14:08.360
materialist.
 

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:13.639
And well, we will talk very
briefly about this.

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:16.759
Let me just foreshadow. Right?
 

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:22.322
You know, you are an idealist
when you think that the material

00:14:22.322 --> 00:14:24.969
world is coming from an idea.
 

00:14:24.969 --> 00:14:25.788
Right?
 

00:14:25.788 --> 00:14:30.600
If you believe that there was a
transcendental being like God,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.980
and this transcendental being,
by its act of will,

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.730
created the world and created
humans,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.629
then you are an idealist.
 

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:44.163
If you believe that the ideas
are explaining human behavior,

00:14:44.163 --> 00:14:46.240
then you are an idealist.
 

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.442
Materialists are the ones who
start from the material

00:14:50.442 --> 00:14:54.971
conditions and try to explain
the ideas from the material

00:14:54.971 --> 00:14:55.860
conditions.
 

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:56.750
Right?
 

00:14:56.750 --> 00:15:02.134
Feuerbach made this provocative
statement that we invented God,

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:04.740
rather than God creating us.
 

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.087
Marx goes further and he will
say, "Well you have ideas

00:15:08.087 --> 00:15:08.940
in your head.
 

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:13.748
I can tell you why you have
these ideas when I look at your

00:15:13.748 --> 00:15:16.070
material conditions."
 

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:19.730
And he will later on say that,
"When I understand your

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:24.368
position in the class structure,
and I understand your economic

00:15:24.368 --> 00:15:27.029
interests,
then I will be able to tell you

00:15:27.029 --> 00:15:29.538
why you think the way you
think." Right?

00:15:29.538 --> 00:15:33.802
This is the materialist's
approach, when you explain ideas

00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:38.289
from the material conditions,
versus the other way around.

00:15:38.289 --> 00:15:44.240
And this comes from Feuerbach.
 

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.606
It is Feuerbach's inspiration.
 

00:15:46.606 --> 00:15:47.158
Right?
 

00:15:47.158 --> 00:15:50.871
So you bring together the
critical theory of Hegel and the

00:15:50.871 --> 00:15:54.807
Young Hegelians,
radical critical theory,

00:15:54.807 --> 00:15:59.899
and naturalism of Feuerbach,
eventually pushing it further

00:15:59.899 --> 00:16:02.250
and to say,
"Let's not fool around it.

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:04.490
It is materialism all
right."

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:05.690
Okay?
 

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:08.509
Now what about--let's continue
with the life.

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:12.657
'42, he moves to Cologne,
the city of Cologne,

00:16:12.657 --> 00:16:17.908
and becomes a journalist for
Rheinische Zeitung;

00:16:17.908 --> 00:16:21.149
eventually even becomes the
editor of this journal.

00:16:21.149 --> 00:16:27.269
And what he's writing is just
liberal journalism.

00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:28.899
He's not a radical yet.
 

00:16:28.899 --> 00:16:30.558
He's a bourgeois liberal.
 

00:16:30.558 --> 00:16:35.710
He is writing articles about,
you know, the freedom of the

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.240
press and civil liberties.
 

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:42.952
He's writing stuff what John
Stuart Mill would not object to

00:16:42.952 --> 00:16:43.510
at all.
 

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:44.230
Right?
 

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:53.038
Then '43, he marries--I again
cracked this joke before--

00:16:53.038 --> 00:16:57.000
after a long engagement,
Jenny von Westphalen,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.519
who comes from,
you know, a noble family,

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:07.470
a very high class family-- not
a Jewish family,

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:09.859
a high class family.
 

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.150
Here is a picture of them too.
 

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:15.048
Well he was graying fast. Right?
 

00:17:15.048 --> 00:17:24.200
Well he was running into some
political troubles very soon.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:29.692
Now we will very quickly see
some extraordinary years in

00:17:29.692 --> 00:17:33.088
Marx's intellectual development.
 

00:17:33.088 --> 00:17:36.346
1843, '44, '45,
just three years,

00:17:36.346 --> 00:17:42.453
it's quite extraordinary what
is happening in Marx's mind and

00:17:42.453 --> 00:17:44.490
how far he goes.
 

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:50.057
Already in '43 he is beginning
to write some very important

00:17:50.057 --> 00:17:51.690
pieces of work.
 

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:55.167
I will talk about them in a
minute, when we will get to

00:17:55.167 --> 00:17:56.068
Marx's work.
 

00:17:56.068 --> 00:18:00.055
One is called A Contribution
to the Critique of Hegel's

00:18:00.055 --> 00:18:03.902
Philosophy of the State,
or Hegel's Philosophy of

00:18:03.902 --> 00:18:07.538
Law, or Rights;
it's translated differently.

00:18:07.538 --> 00:18:12.608
And then he's writing a very
provocative essay,

00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:14.542
"On the Jewish
Question"

00:18:14.542 --> 00:18:17.708
in which he's beginning to
distinguish himself from the

00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:18.880
Young Hegelians.
 

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:23.434
Both of these pieces,
especially "On the Jewish

00:18:23.434 --> 00:18:27.454
Question,"
are unacceptable to the German

00:18:27.454 --> 00:18:30.940
police and political
establishment.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.551
So he had to leave Germany,
and he escapes and he moves to

00:18:35.551 --> 00:18:36.200
Paris.
 

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.900
And here it is, 38 Rue Vaneau.
 

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:45.586
That's where he lived,
and that's where Marx wrote his

00:18:45.586 --> 00:18:49.880
extraordinary unpublished
manuscript,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.390
what is called The Paris
Manuscript of 1844,

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.150
but from which you have read
something,

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.284
and some of them are the jewel
pieces of social science

00:19:00.284 --> 00:19:01.278
literature.
 

00:19:01.278 --> 00:19:05.957
Some of them are impenetrable,
but some of them is quite

00:19:05.957 --> 00:19:09.700
penetrable and still blows
people's minds.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.503
Okay, 1844 in Paris,
he abandons this book,

00:19:13.503 --> 00:19:18.667
The Critique of Hegel
but he wrote an Introduction,

00:19:18.667 --> 00:19:22.019
and I will talk about this
later.

00:19:22.019 --> 00:19:26.577
This, in many ways,
is quite an extraordinary piece

00:19:26.577 --> 00:19:27.490
of work.
 

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:31.808
It's a wonderful piece of
poetry, and he's sort of

00:19:31.808 --> 00:19:35.160
beginning to lay out his
philosophy.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.766
And then in the summer of '44
he completes--no,

00:19:38.766 --> 00:19:41.980
doesn't complete,
he abandons The Paris

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.970
Manuscripts;
and for good reasons.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.596
And we will talk about this,
why he never published it and

00:19:49.596 --> 00:19:52.349
never finished it;
though, I mean,

00:19:52.349 --> 00:19:55.410
it is quite a brilliant piece.
 

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.996
And he meets a young man,
Friedrich Engels,

00:19:58.996 --> 00:20:03.948
just twenty-four years of age,
and became lifelong friends,

00:20:03.948 --> 00:20:07.618
and they're beginning to work
together.

00:20:07.618 --> 00:20:10.828
They are writing this book,
The Holy Family.

00:20:10.828 --> 00:20:13.740
I strongly recommend you do not
read it.

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:17.828
I have read it a number of
times and suffered a lot.

00:20:17.828 --> 00:20:20.538
So I want to save you from
suffering.

00:20:20.538 --> 00:20:23.199
But there are some very
important things in The Holy

00:20:23.199 --> 00:20:26.974
Family;
just the price you have to pay

00:20:26.974 --> 00:20:30.318
to find the jewel is very high.
 

00:20:30.318 --> 00:20:33.710
Okay, and then they write many
other things together.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:36.348
The Communist Manifesto
they write together.

00:20:36.348 --> 00:20:40.240
The German Ideology they
write together;

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.589
and many other things.
 

00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:44.460
Engels was a brilliant mind.
 

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.584
In fact, he was a much more
clearer analytic mind than Karl

00:20:49.584 --> 00:20:54.973
Marx, and he had a much better
sense of empirical reality than

00:20:54.973 --> 00:20:55.769
Marx.
 

00:20:55.769 --> 00:20:58.078
Marx was a bit of an abstract
guy.

00:20:58.078 --> 00:21:00.470
But Marx was really the genius.
 

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.009
Right?
 

00:21:01.009 --> 00:21:04.710
Friedrich Engels was just a
kind of Yale professor;

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.960
you know, that Karl Marx was a
sort of a genius really.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:13.451
'45, well even in Paris it is
unbearable what they are doing,

00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:18.210
so they're kicked out from
Paris, and then they go to

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:19.400
Brussels.
 

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.380
And here is Engels when they
met.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:28.607
Well there is--to continue the
work--a big change in Marx in

00:21:28.607 --> 00:21:34.308
1945--as some people say,
the epistemological break.

00:21:34.308 --> 00:21:37.688
Until '45, until The Paris
Manuscript,

00:21:37.688 --> 00:21:40.759
Marx is still in some ways a
Hegelian.

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:45.069
Now he's changing and he's
becoming a materialist,

00:21:45.069 --> 00:21:49.731
and he coins the term
historical materialism to

00:21:49.731 --> 00:21:52.019
describe his position.
 

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:55.930
One important piece is The
Theses on Feuerbach.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:58.130
I make you to read that.
 

00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.640
I think it is a fantastic piece
of work.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.722
He again did not publish it,
and I will explain to you why,

00:22:04.722 --> 00:22:08.384
though it is brilliant,
why he shied away and did not

00:22:08.384 --> 00:22:11.080
publish it;
it is in tension with the main

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.160
message what he tries to get
through.

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:19.828
And then '45,
'46, together with Engels,

00:22:19.828 --> 00:22:23.000
they write again another
unfinished manuscript,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.488
which was published only in
1904--and even in 1904 only

00:22:28.488 --> 00:22:31.750
partially--
The German Ideology.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:36.170
Again, there are some
extraordinary pieces in these

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.380
incomplete manuscripts.
 

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:41.098
Then comes the year of
revolutions.

00:22:41.098 --> 00:22:47.348
February 22- 24 in '48,
a violent revolution in France.

00:22:47.348 --> 00:22:51.336
They sit down with Engels and
within a week they write The

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:53.930
Manifesto of the Communist
Party.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:57.220
They just tell what the
revolution should be doing.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.580
Well this is in a pamphlet--a
pamphlet with a lot of

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:08.296
disturbing statements,
but a pamphlet with some very

00:23:08.296 --> 00:23:11.840
insightful,
very important social analysis

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.490
as well.
 

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:15.779
A piece of work which cannot be
ignored.

00:23:15.779 --> 00:23:17.278
It can be hated.
 

00:23:17.278 --> 00:23:22.308
It was loved by many but
usually now it is hated.

00:23:22.308 --> 00:23:26.180
But even if you hate it or love
it, you better read it,

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.763
and you pay attention to some
of the very important

00:23:29.763 --> 00:23:30.838
statements.
 

00:23:30.838 --> 00:23:33.839
And what is extraordinary--this
is a pretty long manuscript.

00:23:33.839 --> 00:23:35.538
They were writing like crazy.
 

00:23:35.538 --> 00:23:39.590
I mean, I think I'm a fast
writer, but I could not do it in

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:40.220
a week.
 

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:45.840
And a reasonably polished
piece, especially in comparison

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.048
with his other work.
 

00:23:48.048 --> 00:23:52.150
Now he's expelled from
Brussels, but he moves to

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:56.250
revolutionary Paris,
on March 5^(th) already.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:57.680
But the revolution continues.
 

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:00.654
March 13^(th),
Vienna is on fire.

00:24:00.654 --> 00:24:01.400
Right?
 

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.296
But you have to wait only two
days and Buda and Pest in

00:24:06.296 --> 00:24:08.200
Hungary is on fire.
 

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.338
The revolution is spreading all
over in Europe.

00:24:11.338 --> 00:24:15.750
March 18^(th),
it's already in Berlin.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.044
Paris, Vienna,
Buda and Pest,

00:24:18.044 --> 00:24:20.828
Berlin, whole Europe is on
fire.

00:24:20.828 --> 00:24:24.410
This is exactly what Marx was
saying will be happening.

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:27.028
Right there,
it is happening indeed.

00:24:27.028 --> 00:24:30.200
So Marx and Engels return to
Germany.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.818
Now they will carry out the
torch of the revolution.

00:24:34.818 --> 00:24:38.048
Well it doesn't last
for--that's a picture,

00:24:38.048 --> 00:24:41.970
a bad picture of some of the
revolution in Paris.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:43.858
It was quite a bloody event.
 

00:24:43.858 --> 00:24:47.384
And here is The Communist
Manifesto,

00:24:47.384 --> 00:24:50.655
the First Edition--end of
February 1848,

00:24:50.655 --> 00:24:55.019
when it was printed fast and
distributed widely.

00:24:55.019 --> 00:24:58.336
Well, you know,
revolution doesn't last too

00:24:58.336 --> 00:24:58.890
long.
 

00:24:58.890 --> 00:25:01.902
In October '48,
Austria carries out a

00:25:01.902 --> 00:25:03.660
counter-revolution.
 

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:06.838
They oppress the revolution in
Hungary.

00:25:06.838 --> 00:25:11.695
November the 8^(th) there is a
counter-revolutionary coup in

00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:12.519
Prussia.
 

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:16.078
The revolution is depressed.
 

00:25:16.078 --> 00:25:20.814
And then December 1848--well
this is not a violent

00:25:20.814 --> 00:25:25.755
counter-revolution,
but the French go and vote on

00:25:25.755 --> 00:25:29.893
elections,
and they elect a guy whose name

00:25:29.893 --> 00:25:34.880
is Louis Napoleon Bonaparte as
president of France.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.019
It was a very stupid way to
vote.

00:25:38.019 --> 00:25:43.230
Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was
the nephew of Napoleon.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:50.000
His father was Napoleon's
brother, younger brother,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.321
and he was the king--he was
made king of the Netherlands

00:25:54.321 --> 00:25:56.678
until,
of course, Napoleon fell and he

00:25:56.678 --> 00:26:00.814
was ousted,
and Louis Napoleon Bonaparte

00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:05.190
grew up in Switzerland,
in exile.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:11.757
Was not a particularly smart
person and caused a lot of

00:26:11.757 --> 00:26:14.190
trouble in France.
 

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:17.230
Well here he is when he was
president.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:23.400
Later on he became an emperor
of France;

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.685
Napoleon III,
he renamed himself,

00:26:26.685 --> 00:26:29.460
and kept causing trouble.
 

00:26:29.460 --> 00:26:30.798
Yeah.
 

00:26:30.798 --> 00:26:35.560
Well Marx returned to Paris
briefly and was hoping,

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:41.273
you know, the French eventually
will come to their senses and

00:26:41.273 --> 00:26:43.558
overthrow this jerk.
 

00:26:43.558 --> 00:26:47.756
Well the French did not come to
their senses.

00:26:47.756 --> 00:26:48.519
Right?
 

00:26:48.519 --> 00:26:52.622
It looks like the French
occasionally do silly political

00:26:52.622 --> 00:26:55.009
things, like the Jacobins did.
 

00:26:55.009 --> 00:27:02.250
Electing Louis Napoleon
Bonaparte was not a smart thing.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:05.144
But, you know,
therefore they have to move to

00:27:05.144 --> 00:27:08.960
London, and that's where he
spends the rest of his life.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.781
This is where he has another go
at the big book he wants to

00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:13.308
write.
 

00:27:13.308 --> 00:27:17.078
It is called Grundrisse,
and I will ask you--

00:27:17.078 --> 00:27:20.500
it will be a little sweating to
read it,

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.321
but I promise I ask you to read
the most readable part of the

00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:26.930
Grundrisse.
 

00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:30.765
So if you will have troubles
reading what I ask you to read,

00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:33.558
remember the rest would be
much, much worse.

00:27:33.558 --> 00:27:34.210
Right?
 

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:37.210
So you have to enjoy reading it.
 

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:40.858
But I think it's--what I ask
you to read is extremely

00:27:40.858 --> 00:27:43.948
important to understand who the
real Marx is.

00:27:43.948 --> 00:27:44.650
Right?
 

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:48.468
There are many faces of Karl
Marx, and one of--one outcome

00:27:48.468 --> 00:27:50.880
most clearly in the
Grundrisse.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.851
Then he writes finally the
book what he always wanted to

00:27:54.851 --> 00:27:57.140
do, Das Kapital,
in 1867.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:01.068
Then there is another
revolution in France,

00:28:01.068 --> 00:28:03.672
the Commune,
and this is a real proletarian

00:28:03.672 --> 00:28:06.715
revolution--
very much following what Marx

00:28:06.715 --> 00:28:10.618
and Engels wrote in The
Communist Manifesto.

00:28:10.618 --> 00:28:13.804
There are few instances in
history when two people can

00:28:13.804 --> 00:28:17.468
claim, "We wrote it down,
and here the masses put it into

00:28:17.468 --> 00:28:18.490
action."
 

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:19.980
They did it in France.
 

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.868
And then already in '64 Marx
created a political

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:26.104
organization,
what he called

00:28:26.104 --> 00:28:31.068
International--International,
The Workers' Organization;

00:28:31.068 --> 00:28:34.858
eventually we refer to this as
the First International--with a

00:28:34.858 --> 00:28:37.529
Russian anarchist,
whose name is Bakunin.

00:28:37.529 --> 00:28:41.839
'71, there is this proletarian
revolution inspired by The

00:28:41.839 --> 00:28:43.740
Communist Manifesto.
 

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:47.548
They proclaim a Commune in
Paris.

00:28:47.548 --> 00:28:51.990
It's not all that different
from Soviet Russia or Maoist

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:53.930
China--the same ideas.
 

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:56.380
Does not last too long. Right?
 

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.269
In two weeks it is suppressed
and overthrown.

00:28:59.269 --> 00:29:04.430
And Marx dissolves the
International.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:08.358
There is a big fight between
Bakunin and Marx.

00:29:08.358 --> 00:29:12.250
I think in this big fight
Bakunin, who is actually not

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:15.355
very smart,
but in the--I think in the

00:29:15.355 --> 00:29:19.750
debate Bakunin is quite right
about Marx's state-ism--

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:24.190
too much belief in Marx what
the government should do,

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:27.779
and Bakunin is bottom-up, right?
 

00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:30.160
Bakunin is an anarchist.
 

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.528
He believes in the ordinary
people and he wants to get rid

00:29:33.528 --> 00:29:36.068
of the state,
rather than doing stuff by the

00:29:36.068 --> 00:29:36.660
state.
 

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.798
Anyway, they dissolved the
First International.

00:29:40.798 --> 00:29:45.150
Well the defeat of the Paris
Commune was a very ugly affair.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:48.700
People were mass murdered
without trial.

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.808
Not very nice stuff.
 

00:29:50.808 --> 00:29:53.298
Though, I mean,
the Paris Commune--of course,

00:29:53.298 --> 00:29:56.980
you know, if you,
as the anarchists are saying,

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.028
"Well, if you want to have
scrambled eggs,

00:30:01.028 --> 00:30:04.288
you have to break a couple of
eggs." Right?

00:30:04.288 --> 00:30:08.413
So if you have a revolution,
occasionally you shoot.

00:30:08.413 --> 00:30:09.058
Right?
 

00:30:09.058 --> 00:30:13.070
Well, there was shooting during
the Commune--there was a lot of

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.817
shooting after the Commune.
 

00:30:14.817 --> 00:30:15.400
Right?
 

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.748
Well after the Commune,
we have a conservative epoch in

00:30:20.748 --> 00:30:21.640
Europe.
 

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.672
Bismarck in
Germany--right?--the Iron

00:30:26.672 --> 00:30:28.490
Chancellor.
 

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:33.980
Queen Victoria--right?--ethical
conservativism.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:38.660
Kaiser Franz Joseph,
the Blue Danube.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.700
Right?
 

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.099
The Operetta. Right?
 

00:30:41.099 --> 00:30:44.660
But a very conservative guy.
 

00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:48.670
I have so many nice anecdotes
about him.

00:30:48.670 --> 00:30:53.330
Too bad the course doesn't last
two semesters because I could

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:58.069
entertain you with great stories
about Kaiser Franz Joseph.

00:30:58.069 --> 00:31:01.700
Big trouble the guy.
 

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.950
He primarily caused the First
World War,

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:08.621
out of a completely stupid
action, and caused the deaths of

00:31:08.621 --> 00:31:13.500
millions of people in a bloody,
terrible, stupid war.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.731
Well but there is no room in
this conservative time for

00:31:17.731 --> 00:31:18.594
revolution.
 

00:31:18.594 --> 00:31:19.299
Right?
 

00:31:19.299 --> 00:31:21.000
Revolutionary Marxism.
 

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.278
Marx dies in desperation.
 

00:31:23.278 --> 00:31:27.376
Actually if you read the later
work, his mind is gradually

00:31:27.376 --> 00:31:28.598
disintegrating.
 

00:31:28.598 --> 00:31:34.355
And he's buried together with
Jenny in London Highgate

00:31:34.355 --> 00:31:35.548
Cemetery.
 

00:31:35.548 --> 00:31:41.223
There was just a piece in
New York Review of Books

00:31:41.223 --> 00:31:46.695
on Highgate Cemetery--also names
the Tomb of Karl Marx,

00:31:46.695 --> 00:31:50.750
which stands there,
and Marxists go.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:55.509
Now a postscript well they
create a Second International,

00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:57.039
after his death.
 

00:31:57.039 --> 00:31:59.990
Engels created it.
 

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:03.813
It eventually became what we
call a Social Democratic

00:32:03.813 --> 00:32:04.990
International.
 

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:06.509
It still exists.
 

00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:10.230
Social Democratic parties
occasionally meet on an

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:12.088
international meeting.
 

00:32:12.088 --> 00:32:19.189
For awhile, when the Democratic
Party was a kind of JFK liberal

00:32:19.189 --> 00:32:22.560
party,
even the American Democratic

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:27.327
Party sent observers to the
Second International meetings.

00:32:27.327 --> 00:32:28.078
Right?
 

00:32:28.078 --> 00:32:32.203
Bobby Kennedy was kind of very
sympathetic to the Second

00:32:32.203 --> 00:32:35.988
International--
were kind of considering should

00:32:35.988 --> 00:32:40.035
not the Democratic Party join
the Social Democratic

00:32:40.035 --> 00:32:42.140
International Movement?
 

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:45.558
1917, there is a Communist
revolution in Russia.

00:32:45.558 --> 00:32:49.173
In 1919, they say,
"Second International,

00:32:49.173 --> 00:32:50.779
this really sucks.
 

00:32:50.779 --> 00:32:53.349
This is not about revolution.
 

00:32:53.349 --> 00:32:55.548
This is about reform.
 

00:32:55.548 --> 00:32:58.170
We need a real revolutionary
organization."

00:32:58.170 --> 00:33:00.960
They create the Third
International or Communist

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:03.797
International,
which lasts until the Second

00:33:03.797 --> 00:33:05.486
World War,
when Russia,

00:33:05.486 --> 00:33:08.657
Soviet Russia,
needs the help of the United

00:33:08.657 --> 00:33:11.680
States to defeat militarily
Germany,

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.213
and the U.S.
 

00:33:12.213 --> 00:33:14.085
said, "All right,
but you dissolve the

00:33:14.085 --> 00:33:15.108
International."
 

00:33:15.108 --> 00:33:17.400
So they did dissolve the
International.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:21.736
There is actually a Fourth
International--I don't have time

00:33:21.736 --> 00:33:25.700
really to talk about
this--created by Leon Trotsky.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:31.006
All right, so that's about the
life of one of our major

00:33:31.006 --> 00:33:33.068
authors, Karl Marx.
 

00:33:33.068 --> 00:33:38.740
And let me go on and talk about
his theory of alienation.

00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:44.025
And I have, my goodness,
twelve minutes to do that,

00:33:44.025 --> 00:33:49.308
though I could spend in fact a
semester on this.

00:33:49.308 --> 00:33:54.170
Well but let me try to
economize with my time,

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:58.037
and I'll just very briefly rush
through what is leading to

00:33:58.037 --> 00:34:02.038
The Paris Manuscript and
the theory of alienation.

00:34:02.038 --> 00:34:06.229
And I really have to talk about
alienation, so I will skip a lot

00:34:06.229 --> 00:34:08.690
of stuff leading to the
alienation.

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:12.686
As I said, Hegel is the point
of departure for Marx's theory

00:34:12.686 --> 00:34:13.768
of alienation.
 

00:34:13.768 --> 00:34:17.873
But there is a kind of
intellectual project for the

00:34:17.873 --> 00:34:18.940
young Marx.
 

00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:22.942
As I said, he writes--tries to
write this book,

00:34:22.942 --> 00:34:27.380
a critique of Hegel's
philosophy of right.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:32.733
In this book Hegel suggested
that there is a--the civil

00:34:32.733 --> 00:34:36.699
servants constitute a universal
class.

00:34:36.699 --> 00:34:41.402
It is a critique of the French
Revolution and the bourgeois

00:34:41.402 --> 00:34:46.431
society in which Hegel felt the
workers and the capitalists are

00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:50.000
representing particularistic
interests,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.380
and order can be brought into
this only by civil servants,

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:57.384
by the government,
who represents the universal

00:34:57.384 --> 00:34:58.429
point of view.
 

00:34:58.429 --> 00:35:00.809
And Marx criticizes this book.
 

00:35:00.809 --> 00:35:04.936
Then he writes "On the
Jewish Question",

00:35:04.936 --> 00:35:07.550
where he said,
"Well the state

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.563
bureaucrats are not universal,
but we need a universal

00:35:11.563 --> 00:35:15.409
standpoint,
we need universal emancipation,

00:35:15.409 --> 00:35:16.769
as such."
 

00:35:16.769 --> 00:35:18.190
That's the point of view.
 

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.039
Then he writes this wonderful
piece,

00:35:20.039 --> 00:35:22.255
Introduction to the Critique
of Hegel's Philosophy of

00:35:22.255 --> 00:35:23.673
Right,
and he said,

00:35:23.673 --> 00:35:27.476
"But who will carry out
this universal point of

00:35:27.476 --> 00:35:28.518
view?"
 

00:35:28.518 --> 00:35:31.554
And it is the introduction for
the first time in '44,

00:35:31.554 --> 00:35:34.590
January, and he said,
"The proletariat."

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:36.900
But people say,
"Why the proletariat?

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:38.489
Goodness gracious."
 

00:35:38.489 --> 00:35:40.280
That's when The Paris
Manuscript comes in.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.012
He said, "The proletariat,
because the proletariat is the

00:35:44.012 --> 00:35:47.822
ultimate of alienation,
and because they are alienated,

00:35:47.822 --> 00:35:51.449
they have the interest to
overcome alienation."

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:54.940
Well I think I just have to
rush through.

00:35:54.940 --> 00:36:01.260
I will put this stuff on the
internet, but I really don't

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:05.210
have time to get into any
detail.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:07.166
I want to get,
in the last few minutes,

00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:09.018
into The Paris
Manuscripts.

00:36:09.018 --> 00:36:12.909
And this is the structure of
The Paris Manuscript of

00:36:12.909 --> 00:36:13.380
1844.
 

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:18.757
You can see the line of
argument, how he's developing

00:36:18.757 --> 00:36:20.309
his argument.
 

00:36:20.309 --> 00:36:24.920
What is really interesting from
The Paris Manuscripts is

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:28.789
the first manuscript,
which is twenty-seven pages.

00:36:28.789 --> 00:36:31.278
It is on wages,
profits and rent,

00:36:31.278 --> 00:36:34.780
and culminates with the idea of
alienation.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:39.235
Again, unfortunately I don't
have more time to work more on

00:36:39.235 --> 00:36:39.619
it.
 

00:36:39.619 --> 00:36:47.750
Especially Section IV is
crucially important.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.601
And the second and the third
manuscripts are of lesser

00:36:52.601 --> 00:36:53.699
important.
 

00:36:53.699 --> 00:36:57.360
Now the major themes:
wage, profit and rent,

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:01.021
and private ownership,
they all culminate in

00:37:01.021 --> 00:37:02.300
alienation.
 

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.309
This is a re-interpretation of
Hegel.

00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:10.880
Alienation does not come from
ideas, it comes out of material

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:15.429
conditions of the nature of
capitalist economy.

00:37:15.429 --> 00:37:18.630
As I said, he does not have the
notion of capitalism.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:22.898
It comes out of the nature of
commodity producing commercial

00:37:22.898 --> 00:37:23.478
society.
 

00:37:23.478 --> 00:37:24.130
Right?
 

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.340
That's where alienation is
coming from,

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:30.246
rather than ideas,
and the problem can only be

00:37:30.246 --> 00:37:33.605
solved if you fix the problems
of commodity producing

00:37:33.605 --> 00:37:34.510
societies.
 

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:39.409
And then he identifies four
characteristics of alienation.

00:37:39.409 --> 00:37:41.590
And I will talk to this.
 

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:45.920
Alienation is from the object
of production.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:51.280
The second is alienation from
the act of production.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:55.150
Then alienation from species
being;

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:58.889
again, a very big
word--Gattungswesen,

00:37:58.889 --> 00:37:59.909
in German.
 

00:37:59.909 --> 00:38:03.740
What makes us human,
what makes us distinct from

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:08.469
animals, that's what the notion
species being refers to.

00:38:08.469 --> 00:38:11.599
And finally alienation from
fellow man.

00:38:11.599 --> 00:38:14.362
Well I have seven minutes to
labor on this,

00:38:14.362 --> 00:38:15.679
so let me do that.
 

00:38:15.679 --> 00:38:21.320
Okay, as I said he reinterprets
Hegel's alienation.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:25.449
Hegel wanted to overcome
alienation in thought.

00:38:25.449 --> 00:38:30.820
Alienation was a problem of the
state of consciousness.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:35.615
Marx wants to ground the theory
in material practices.

00:38:35.615 --> 00:38:36.340
Right?
 

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:42.460
And when emerges alienation?
 

00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:50.764
When labor is becoming a
commodity and when profit drives

00:38:50.764 --> 00:38:56.143
the economy;
that's when we enter the stage

00:38:56.143 --> 00:39:00.989
of alienation and private
property emerges.

00:39:00.989 --> 00:39:05.110
Well I'll just leave this
section out, and let me speak to

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:08.797
the four dimensions of
alienation in the next six or

00:39:08.797 --> 00:39:10.099
seven minutes.
 

00:39:10.099 --> 00:39:13.264
So the first point is there is
in--you know,

00:39:13.264 --> 00:39:17.755
we are talking about commodity
producing commercial societies,

00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:19.670
to put it with Adam Smith.
 

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:20.480
Right?
 

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.806
Or Marx will call it later
on--it will take him one more

00:39:24.806 --> 00:39:29.369
year to figure out what is
really the nature of the society

00:39:29.369 --> 00:39:31.179
he's talking about.
 

00:39:31.179 --> 00:39:34.677
But already in The German
Ideology,

00:39:34.677 --> 00:39:39.369
as we will see it Tuesday or
Thursday, he coins the term

00:39:39.369 --> 00:39:43.210
the capitalist mode of
production.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:45.780
So in the capitalist mode of
production,

00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:52.380
in a commodity producing
society, the object which labor

00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:55.483
produces,
labor's product,

00:39:55.483 --> 00:40:00.889
confronts the workers as
something alien from him,

00:40:00.889 --> 00:40:04.273
as a power alien of the
producer.

00:40:04.273 --> 00:40:05.119
Right?
 

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:08.992
Under these conditions,
this realization of labor

00:40:08.992 --> 00:40:13.110
appears as the loss of
realization of the worker.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:17.074
In sharp contrast with petty
commodity production,

00:40:17.074 --> 00:40:21.686
the work of the artisan where
the work what you produce is

00:40:21.686 --> 00:40:25.934
part of your own life;
you identify with the part what

00:40:25.934 --> 00:40:26.766
you produce.
 

00:40:26.766 --> 00:40:27.320
Right?
 

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.320
You are a shoe-maker,
you are producing a beautiful

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:30.619
shoe.
 

00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:31.159
Right?
 

00:40:31.159 --> 00:40:33.050
You are proud of the shoe.
 

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:37.476
You go to the church Sunday and
you saw a nice lady walking in

00:40:37.476 --> 00:40:40.414
these beautiful shoes,
and you proudly say,

00:40:40.414 --> 00:40:41.989
"This is my shoe."
 

00:40:41.989 --> 00:40:42.440
Right?
 

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:45.449
Then you are not alienated.
 

00:40:45.449 --> 00:40:46.230
Right?
 

00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:50.880
When you are working on the
production line and you are mass

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.480
producing, you know,
Toyota Camry,

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.923
you don't know what you
produce.

00:40:55.923 --> 00:40:56.869
Right?
 

00:40:56.869 --> 00:40:59.110
It's an alien object from you.
 

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:02.773
You put a little bit of work
into the product,

00:41:02.773 --> 00:41:06.030
and the product is not you any
longer;

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.820
it is something which is alien
from you.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:13.666
Well, of course,
not all work is necessarily

00:41:13.666 --> 00:41:15.018
alienated.
 

00:41:15.018 --> 00:41:19.023
You know if you are an artist,
if you are a scholar,

00:41:19.023 --> 00:41:23.813
you identify the work and you
have copyright for the work what

00:41:23.813 --> 00:41:25.070
you produce.
 

00:41:25.070 --> 00:41:28.579
But ordinary workers usually do
not have a copyright;

00:41:28.579 --> 00:41:32.010
you know they cannot license
the work what they produce.

00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:33.940
It becomes alien from them.
 

00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:34.980
That's the point. Right?
 

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:35.780
The product.
 

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:39.518
Well then you are also becoming
alien in the act of production.

00:41:39.518 --> 00:41:43.351
He said because labor is
external to the worker--there

00:41:43.351 --> 00:41:47.329
are different points in
this--external to the worker;

00:41:47.329 --> 00:41:50.570
it does not belong to his
intrinsic nature.

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:58.016
In his work he does not affirm
himself but denies himself--does

00:41:58.016 --> 00:42:01.380
not freely develop itself.
 

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:06.750
You know, you say,
"Well it's already 4:45.

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:09.536
I have only fifteen more
minutes to go and then I am

00:42:09.536 --> 00:42:10.630
free." Right?
 

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:13.425
Life begins when work ends.
 

00:42:13.425 --> 00:42:14.150
Right?
 

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:15.650
You can see it.
 

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.094
You go to the supermarket and
the cashier can hardly wait,

00:42:19.094 --> 00:42:20.969
you know, to get out of here.
 

00:42:20.969 --> 00:42:23.865
I was trying to buy last night
a little beer,

00:42:23.865 --> 00:42:27.090
and it was 8:45 and the cashier
said, "Sorry,

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.329
I cannot sell it to you."
 

00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:30.800
I said, "Why not?
 

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.960
Until 9:00."
 

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.480
She said, "It's not nine
yet?"

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.568
She wanted to get out of there.
 

00:42:35.568 --> 00:42:36.039
Right?
 

00:42:36.039 --> 00:42:39.570
So it's alienated from the
process of production.

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:40.159
Right?
 

00:42:40.159 --> 00:42:42.420
And labor is not voluntary but
forced.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:42.909
Right?
 

00:42:42.909 --> 00:42:45.639
Well forced, not legally.
 

00:42:45.639 --> 00:42:47.889
You can starve. Right?
 

00:42:47.889 --> 00:42:51.101
But if you don't want to starve
and you want to have a place,

00:42:51.101 --> 00:42:53.349
a roof over your head,
you have to work.

00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:54.840
So it is forced economically.
 

00:42:54.840 --> 00:43:01.239
And so it is not--it is,
here is the--and your activity

00:43:01.239 --> 00:43:04.440
belongs to somebody else.
 

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.056
It's somebody else,
you know, who commands you,

00:43:07.056 --> 00:43:09.389
who is the boss,
who tells you what to do,

00:43:09.389 --> 00:43:10.583
and then you shut up.
 

00:43:10.583 --> 00:43:11.210
Right?
 

00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:13.554
And this is why,
you know, in the act of

00:43:13.554 --> 00:43:15.539
production you have alienation.
 

00:43:15.539 --> 00:43:19.914
The third one is that you are
alienated from your species

00:43:19.914 --> 00:43:22.179
being, of your human being.
 

00:43:22.179 --> 00:43:26.521
And now Marx has a theory of
man in nature.

00:43:26.521 --> 00:43:27.349
Right?
 

00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:32.300
What is man in natural
conditions?

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.400
What makes us man as distinct
from animal?

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.599
There are very different
answers you can give.

00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:42.918
Well Schiller,
the German poet said,

00:43:42.918 --> 00:43:45.670
"What makes us humans?
 

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:48.925
That we know how to play."
 

00:43:48.925 --> 00:43:49.659
Right?
 

00:43:49.659 --> 00:43:51.619
Play makes us human.
 

00:43:51.619 --> 00:43:54.820
Marx said what makes us human,
that we work.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:59.699
Labor, that we transform the
material world to meet our human

00:43:59.699 --> 00:44:04.659
needs, with a plan in our head,
that's what makes us human.

00:44:04.659 --> 00:44:08.065
There are animals which kind of
work, like bees,

00:44:08.065 --> 00:44:10.530
but they don't work with a
plan.

00:44:10.530 --> 00:44:14.463
There are only humans who have
an idea about my house we'll

00:44:14.463 --> 00:44:18.534
build, and then you build the
house as you had the idea about

00:44:18.534 --> 00:44:19.010
it.
 

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:21.880
That is the essence of human
beings.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:26.585
And he said the problem is that
we, in a commodity producing

00:44:26.585 --> 00:44:31.369
society, we are alienated from
labor, what makes us human.

00:44:31.369 --> 00:44:34.889
So we are alienated from our
very human essence.

00:44:34.889 --> 00:44:37.646
That's the most horrifying
thing for Marx,

00:44:37.646 --> 00:44:39.797
in a commodity producing
society.

00:44:39.797 --> 00:44:40.469
Right?
 

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:46.360
And then finally we are
alienated from our fellow man.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:52.789
This is probably the deepest
idea in the whole theory;

00:44:52.789 --> 00:44:58.327
namely, that we're beginning to
treat each others as object.

00:44:58.327 --> 00:44:59.079
Right?
 

00:44:59.079 --> 00:45:03.590
As we are entering the world of
commodity production,

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:08.393
profit maximization,
self-interested individuals

00:45:08.393 --> 00:45:15.139
maximizing utility and thinking
instrumentally around the world.

00:45:15.139 --> 00:45:19.364
What are the most least
expensive means which gets us

00:45:19.364 --> 00:45:21.559
the cheapest to this end?
 

00:45:21.559 --> 00:45:25.514
When we're beginning to treat
each others as instruments.

00:45:25.514 --> 00:45:26.079
Right?
 

00:45:26.079 --> 00:45:28.610
And he said this is the worst
alienation.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.489
Which is new, right?
 

00:45:31.489 --> 00:45:34.565
It has--this is very important
to see in Marx's theory of

00:45:34.565 --> 00:45:35.280
alienation.
 

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.130
It's not a general condition of
humankind, as Hegel thought it.

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:42.250
Alienation is emerging in
modernity.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.958
It does not have the term
capitalism yet,

00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:47.599
or the capitalist mode of
production.

00:45:47.599 --> 00:45:52.443
This is--the characteristics of
modernity and modern industrial

00:45:52.443 --> 00:45:55.960
and urban life,
that we are not interacting

00:45:55.960 --> 00:46:00.996
with each other as human beings,
in an all-sided personal

00:46:00.996 --> 00:46:04.740
relationships,
but we tend to treat each

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.297
others as objects.
 

00:46:06.297 --> 00:46:06.989
Right?
 

00:46:06.989 --> 00:46:10.010
We treat the other person as a
sex object.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.599
Right?
 

00:46:10.599 --> 00:46:17.001
The erotic complex relationship
is reduced to a brutal act of

00:46:17.001 --> 00:46:17.429
sex.
 

00:46:17.429 --> 00:46:18.389
Right?
 

00:46:18.389 --> 00:46:23.373
We treat each other as an
instrument to reach an end.

00:46:23.373 --> 00:46:24.139
Right?
 

00:46:24.139 --> 00:46:28.036
We call the others only when we
need that person for something.

00:46:28.036 --> 00:46:28.539
Right?
 

00:46:28.539 --> 00:46:33.128
We act out of simply
self-interest in interacting

00:46:33.128 --> 00:46:34.849
with the others.
 

00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:36.409
We lack compassion. Right?
 

00:46:36.409 --> 00:46:38.400
We lack love. Right?
 

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.250
We lack sympathy. Right?
 

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:44.489
You know, he probably did not
read his Adam Smith carefully

00:46:44.489 --> 00:46:45.001
enough.
 

00:46:45.001 --> 00:46:45.659
Right?
 

00:46:45.659 --> 00:46:48.929
He has not been reading much
Smith until '44.

00:46:48.929 --> 00:46:52.302
This is where he's beginning to
read Smith very carefully,

00:46:52.302 --> 00:46:53.900
around this time,
in '44.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:56.768
Anyway, you see the point what
he is making.

00:46:56.768 --> 00:46:59.679
And I think what Marx describes
in alienation,

00:46:59.679 --> 00:47:03.469
particularly alienation from
fellow human beings,

00:47:03.469 --> 00:47:07.873
is something what probably some
people in this room can respond

00:47:07.873 --> 00:47:10.460
to,
and to say, "Well yes,

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.059
I did experience that.
 

00:47:12.059 --> 00:47:14.650
I have been treated as an
object.

00:47:14.650 --> 00:47:19.139
When I go to the admission
office, occasionally an

00:47:19.139 --> 00:47:23.813
administrator treats me like a
piece of paper."

00:47:23.813 --> 00:47:24.730
Right?
 

00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:28.594
That's when you are alienated,
when you're becoming an object

00:47:28.594 --> 00:47:30.400
rather than a human being.
 

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:34.670
So that's in a nutshell the
theory of alienation.

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:36.469
The rest will be up on the
internet,

00:47:36.469 --> 00:47:40.114
and you may want to dig into
the whole intellectual

00:47:40.114 --> 00:47:44.416
development which brings you to
the peak of what we call the

00:47:44.416 --> 00:47:47.751
young Marx;
Marx, the Hegelian Marx,

00:47:47.751 --> 00:47:53.360
who is not a materialist yet,
not a historical materialist.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.889
He does not have the idea of
exploitation.

00:47:55.889 --> 00:48:00.472
He does not have the idea of
the capitalist mode of

00:48:00.472 --> 00:48:02.030
production yet.
 

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:03.380
All right. Thank you.
 

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:08.000

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.982
Prof: Okay,
today in the Times there

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:05.710
was a report of a clinical
trial,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.213
which event,
the kind of thing we talked

00:00:09.213 --> 00:00:10.830
about on Friday.
 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.840
This was of a statin,
which is like Lipitor.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.730
It's a different one,
it's Crestor.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.288
But they just reported that a
study of 18,000 people -- so a

00:00:20.288 --> 00:00:23.364
very big clinical trial --
seemed to show that this,

00:00:23.364 --> 00:00:26.931
that it helped;
it reduced the risk of heart

00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:32.119
attack by a half for people who
didn't have high cholesterol,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.011
but had another risk,
this C-reactive protein,

00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:36.790
CRP.
 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.785
And it said in the story this
morning: "Like many

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:42.847
clinical trials,
the Jupiter Study was sponsored

00:00:42.847 --> 00:00:46.210
by a pharmaceutical company,
in this case AstraZeneca.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.895
It makes the drug in the trial,
rosuvastatin,

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:50.910
which is sold as Crestor."
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.256
And then it says:
"Dr. Ridker,

00:00:53.256 --> 00:00:57.120
a co-inventor of a CRP test,
said he first sought federal

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.570
financing for the study and was
turned down.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.679
He and other scientists
interviewed for this article,

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.344
except for Dr. Nabel,
Dr. Gardner and Dr. Wolfe,

00:01:05.344 --> 00:01:08.465
have consulted for or received
research money from stain

00:01:08.465 --> 00:01:09.769
makers."
 

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:12.838
I guess I should say that I've
occasionally gotten money from

00:01:12.838 --> 00:01:15.500
statin makers too,
but not for this kind of thing.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.256
Okay, so that's interesting and
relevant to what we're talking

00:01:20.256 --> 00:01:20.879
about.
 

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:24.320
But specifically what we're
talking about now is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.420
nomenclature.
 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.186
And last time we talked about
constitutional nomenclature,

00:01:29.186 --> 00:01:33.019
the rules people made up for
naming the nature and sequence

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:33.879
of bonds.
 

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:36.676
But since arrangement in space
is also important,

00:01:36.676 --> 00:01:39.940
you have to be able to have
names for stereochemistry.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.498
And right now we're interested
in configurational

00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:46.538
stereochemistry,
the kind that can only be

00:01:46.538 --> 00:01:49.430
changed by breaking bonds --
right?

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.992
-- whereas, as we'll see soon,
conformational changes don't

00:01:52.992 --> 00:01:56.310
require breaking bonds,
so typically are much easier to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.739
do.
 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.341
So configurational isomers
include the tartaric acids that

00:02:00.341 --> 00:02:03.501
we've been speaking about,
that have these physical

00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:04.450
properties.
 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.790
One has a unique melting point.
 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.068
The other two are the same.
 

00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:12.366
But those two differ by the
sign of the optical rotation of

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:13.699
polarized light.
 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.860
So the first one is meso.
 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.110
Now how do we name these things?
 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.764
One way is just to name them
according to the phenomenon,

00:02:21.764 --> 00:02:23.199
to what you observe.
 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:29.068
So sometimes those two tartaric
acids that are enantiomers --

00:02:29.068 --> 00:02:33.560
mirror images of one another
but not superimposable --

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.280
sometimes they're referred to
as small d,

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.590
or small l,
which stands for dextro,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.199
or levo,
and means right or left.

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:45.830
And all it means is the
direction they rotate the plane

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.584
of polarized light,
which you observe

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:48.508
experimentally.
 

00:02:48.508 --> 00:02:52.229
So there's nothing more arcane
about that.

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:56.192
Or you can say plus or minus,
meaning that they rotate light

00:02:56.192 --> 00:02:59.080
to the right or rotate light to
the left.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.020
And those are absolutely the
same thing, right?

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.280
Dextro and plus;
levo and minus.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.908
Sometimes people use both
names, but they're redundant.

00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:12.408
They both mean it rotates light
one way or the other.

00:03:12.408 --> 00:03:14.000
So it just describes the
phenomenon.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.020
So there's nothing ambiguous
about that.

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.669
It's a perfectly good name.
 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.877
But it doesn't tell you what
model you should make to show

00:03:22.877 --> 00:03:24.788
it, which mirror image is which.
 

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:27.129
All you know is which way it
rotates light.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.729
So that's phenomenological.
 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.831
But there can be other names
that have to do with these

00:03:31.831 --> 00:03:34.935
Fischer projections we draw,
as to exactly which one is

00:03:34.935 --> 00:03:35.509
which.
 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:37.419
So that one is clear enough.
 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:41.098
That one has a mirror image --
is its own mirror image.

00:03:41.098 --> 00:03:42.940
There's a mirror that goes
through the middle of it.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.150
So the top is the mirror image
of the bottom.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.710
It's a mirror image of itself.
 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.750
And that one's clearly the meso.
 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.090
Right?
 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.348
But how about the others?
 

00:03:51.348 --> 00:03:54.610
One of them will look one way
and one the other.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.194
But is there any fundamental
thing that we can understand

00:03:58.194 --> 00:04:01.907
that would tell us which will
rotate light to the right and

00:04:01.907 --> 00:04:04.468
which will rotate light to the
left?

00:04:04.468 --> 00:04:09.133
And I'll tell you that I can't
say that, and most people I know

00:04:09.133 --> 00:04:13.270
-- in fact almost everybody I
know -- can't say that.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.949
But there are a few people who
think they can say that,

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.629
and we'll hear about one of
them soon, on Wednesday.

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:22.470
But anyhow it's a question.
 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.795
Is it like -- should it be
those for the right and the

00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:26.639
left-handed, the d and
the l,

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.209
or those?
 

00:04:27.209 --> 00:04:28.879
Which one is which?
 

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:33.185
Well Fischer decided that we
just have to have to names for

00:04:33.185 --> 00:04:36.750
this and we have to be able to
draw pictures,

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.500
so let's make a guess as to
which way it is.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:44.605
And he devised a new system of
naming which doesn't depend on

00:04:44.605 --> 00:04:48.180
the phenomenon but depends on
genealogy;

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.550
that is, synthesis.
 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.935
You take a compound like
glyceraldehyde,

00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:57.319
which is small d and
+.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.610
What does that mean,
d and +?

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.500
Student:  The same thing.
 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.399
Prof: For this?
 

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:03.230
There's a particular bottle of
glyceraldehyde,

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.449
which has that constitution.
 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:05.970
Right?
 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.139
And we're going to label it
d-(+).

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:12.170
And what does that mean?
 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.290
Zack?
 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.060
Student:  Does it rotate
light to the right?

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.660
Prof: That it rotates
light to the right.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.870
But we don't know exactly how
we should draw it -- right?

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.970
-- the structure or its mirror
image.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.709
So, and d and + here,
remember, are redundant.

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:29.120
They both just mean it rotates
light to the right.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.759
But Fischer went further.
 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:36.779
He defined that particular
glyceraldehyde as capital D.

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:40.399
There's a different between
capital D and small d.

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:45.730
Capital D is the name he used,
and that big D-glyceraldehyde,

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.709
he guessed -- the one that
rotates light to the right --

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:52.562
he guessed had that structure,
which when drawn with a Fischer

00:05:52.562 --> 00:05:54.519
projection is that structure.
 

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:55.810
So that's just a guess.
 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.490
So he said this now gives us a
starting point.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.574
This glyceraldehyde,
which I'm going to call capital

00:06:02.574 --> 00:06:05.961
D, and I'm guessing has that
structure -- I might be 100%

00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:06.990
wrong, right?
 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.879
It might be the other one.
 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.689
But let's just make this guess
and then we'll be able to talk

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:11.579
about everything.
 

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.338
So what could you talk about?
 

00:06:13.338 --> 00:06:17.728
You could do a multi-step
synthesis in which the carbons

00:06:17.728 --> 00:06:21.399
connected by the arrows are the
same carbon.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:25.591
That is, you redo the top half
of the molecule by doing

00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:29.240
chemical reactions,
the part that's in green.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:32.509
So CHO becomes that much more
complicated thing.

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:35.649
But you leave intact that
carbon on the bottom.

00:06:35.649 --> 00:06:39.624
So it's the same in tartaric
acid as it was in

00:06:39.624 --> 00:06:42.980
D-glyceraldehyde,
whatever that was.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.600
And we'll guess it's this one,
with the OH on the right.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.610
Is everybody with me,
with the guess he made?

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.454
So now if you can make that
particular tartaric acid isomer

00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:56.987
from D,
capital D, glyceraldehyde,

00:06:56.987 --> 00:07:01.449
then you say that that's
D-tartaric acid,

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:06.310
because you can make it from
D-glyceraldehyde.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.430
Any questions about that?
 

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.670
So it's just what you make from
what.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.115
If you can make it from a
D-compound, you call it a

00:07:14.115 --> 00:07:17.975
D-compound, and the mirror image
would be the L-compound,

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:18.939
capital L.
 

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:19.699
Claire?
 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:23.966
Student:  Is he just
swapping the things in the green

00:07:23.966 --> 00:07:24.689
squares?
 

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:26.430
The arrows are a little
confusing.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.348
Prof: The swap -- the
thing that's in the green square

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:32.509
on the bottom becomes the stuff
in the green square on the top.

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:35.363
Obviously you have to add
another carbon and you have to

00:07:35.363 --> 00:07:37.959
add a couple of hydrogens and
some more oxygens.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:40.259
So you have to do some chemical
transformations.

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:43.257
But the important thing is that
the thing on the top becomes the

00:07:43.257 --> 00:07:46.113
thing on the top,
and the carbons connected by

00:07:46.113 --> 00:07:48.899
the arrow are precisely the same
carbon.

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:49.879
Student:  Right.
 

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:50.759
Prof: Okay?
 

00:07:50.759 --> 00:07:53.742
So that one you know because
you know where it came from by

00:07:53.742 --> 00:07:54.360
genealogy.
 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.206
So that tartaric acid you'll
call capital D,

00:07:57.206 --> 00:07:58.730
according to Fischer.
 

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:05.040
But do you see a weakness in
this nomenclature scheme?

00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:10.420
Yeah, Sherwin?
 

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.190
Student:  It's dependent
on the structure,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.000
your knowledge of the structure
that he showed.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.410
Prof: Well of course it
could be 100% wrong.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.040
Everything could be the mirror
image of what we thought it was.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.350
Right?
 

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:22.937
That's clearly a problem,
and that was well recognized by

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:23.399
Fischer.
 

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:26.730
But maybe I didn't understand
your question -- did I?

00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:27.879
Student:  Yeah,
that's what I was saying.

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:28.319
Prof: Okay.
 

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:29.660
Does anybody see another
weakness?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:30.439
Sam?
 

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:33.190
Student:  Capital D
isn't very descriptive.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.379
Prof: It's certainly not
descriptive in structure,

00:08:35.379 --> 00:08:38.169
except -- unless you know what
d-glyceraldehyde is,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:39.179
then it's descriptive.
 

00:08:39.179 --> 00:08:40.759
But it's not descriptive alone.
 

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:43.200
It's only relative, right?
 

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.529
It's only relative to the
d-glyceraldehyde.

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:48.038
And you have to know how that
relation works.

00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:50.601
For example,
someone else might go into a

00:08:50.601 --> 00:08:53.547
lab and they want to prepare
tartaric acid from

00:08:53.547 --> 00:08:55.340
d-glyceraldehyde.
 

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.990
What might the other person do?
 

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.710
Student:  Prepare it a
different way.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:02.288
Prof: Lucas,
I can't hear.

00:09:02.288 --> 00:09:03.230
Student:  Prepare it a
different way.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:04.590
Prof: Prepare it a
different way.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.386
So somebody else might put that
carbon into the one on the top

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:10.129
and change the brown ones.
 

00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:11.850
Right?
 

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:13.745
There could be other
transformations you do that

00:09:13.745 --> 00:09:16.044
would change the carbon on the
bottom to the carbon on the

00:09:16.044 --> 00:09:17.976
bottom,
and the carbon on the top is

00:09:17.976 --> 00:09:20.200
now the same as the one on
glyceraldehyde.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.100
Right?
 

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.107
In which case it would be
exactly -- that one on the left

00:09:25.107 --> 00:09:28.830
would be named capital D,
if you made it that way.

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:30.389
Everybody see?
 

00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:32.440
The genealogy would just be
different.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.149
Okay?
 

00:09:34.149 --> 00:09:36.269
So there's a fundamental
problem here,

00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:40.529
that the capital D / capital L
designation is ambiguous,

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:44.038
without having some detailed
synthesis recipe,

00:09:44.038 --> 00:09:47.062
or some agreement that people
say we'll always make things

00:09:47.062 --> 00:09:48.919
this way rather than another
way.

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:49.879
Right?
 

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:52.399
So it's not -- doesn't have
meaning on its own.

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:55.029
You have to know exactly how
you made the transformation.

00:09:55.029 --> 00:09:57.908
So that's a pretty cumbersome
way to do names.

00:09:57.908 --> 00:10:01.029
But that's what was done for
sixty years.

00:10:01.029 --> 00:10:02.168
Right?
 

00:10:02.168 --> 00:10:04.548
Those were the names,
capital D and capital L;

00:10:04.548 --> 00:10:07.570
for sugars, for example,
for amino acids.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:10.830
Okay?
 

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.070
And it's relative,
and it's based on a guess.

00:10:15.070 --> 00:10:17.928
But in 1950 things changed.
 

00:10:17.928 --> 00:10:22.259
Because in 1950 a man named
Bijvoet,

00:10:22.259 --> 00:10:24.908
an X-ray crystallographer at
Utrecht --

00:10:24.908 --> 00:10:28.230
in fact working in the van't
Hoff Laboratory,

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:31.991
the same building in which
van't Hoff did the things in

00:10:31.991 --> 00:10:35.445
1874 --
Bijvoet determined the crystal

00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:38.928
structure of sodium rubidium
salt --

00:10:38.928 --> 00:10:41.496
remember, there are two
carboxylic acids in tartaric

00:10:41.496 --> 00:10:41.850
acid.
 

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:48.440
So the sodium rubidium salt of
d (small d)-L-tartrate.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.590
What does the small d
mean?

00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:53.298
Andrew?
 

00:10:53.298 --> 00:10:54.629
Student:  It reflects
the light of the --

00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:56.630
Prof: It rotates the
plane of polarized light,

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.710
or twists it to the right.
 

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:02.409
And what does the capital L
mean?

00:11:02.409 --> 00:11:03.370
Allison?
 

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.379
Student:  Previously we
said it rotated it to the left.

00:11:06.379 --> 00:11:07.418
Prof: I couldn't hear
very well.

00:11:07.418 --> 00:11:09.256
Student:  That
previously we assumed that it

00:11:09.256 --> 00:11:10.360
would rotate it to the left.
 

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.590
Prof: No,
that's not true.

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.451
Or maybe I didn't understand
"previously,"

00:11:15.451 --> 00:11:16.350
what you mean.
 

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.577
Student:  Like well,
the model we were just talking

00:11:18.577 --> 00:11:19.399
about with Fischer.
 

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:21.475
Prof: Right,
it's what we talked about with

00:11:21.475 --> 00:11:23.974
Fischer,
that he was able to make this

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:27.379
tartaric acid from
l-glyceraldehyde,

00:11:27.379 --> 00:11:29.918
from the enantiomer of what we
talked about before.

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:32.481
So it was related by that
particular synthesis to

00:11:32.481 --> 00:11:33.870
l-glyceraldehyde.
 

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:38.009
So there's no conflict between
saying d and L.

00:11:38.009 --> 00:11:38.830
Right?
 

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.576
It rotates light to the right
-- that's the small one -- but

00:11:41.576 --> 00:11:44.230
it's genealogically related to
l-glyceraldehyde.

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:45.538
Okay?
 

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:49.168
But he was able to use a very
special kind of X-ray technique,

00:11:49.168 --> 00:11:52.442
called anomalous dispersion,
which we don't have time to

00:11:52.442 --> 00:11:53.928
talk about right now.
 

00:11:53.928 --> 00:11:57.488
But it was able to show exactly
which way the atoms were

00:11:57.488 --> 00:11:58.200
oriented.
 

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.139
And this is the picture he drew.
 

00:12:01.139 --> 00:12:03.000
Right?
 

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.039
So clearly on the top is C,
two Os, right?;

00:12:06.039 --> 00:12:07.149
a carboxylate group.
 

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:08.610
On the bottom a carboxylate
group.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:12.120
The middle two carbons each
have an H and an O on them.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.370
The O is stippled,
so you see what it is.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.826
And it's clear the way you draw
it what's coming out -- the way

00:12:16.826 --> 00:12:19.241
he drew it, what's coming out
toward you and what's going back

00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:19.519
in.
 

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:24.980
Now here's what Fischer had
guessed, sixty years before,

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:29.350
for L-tartrate,
what he called L-tartrate.

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:32.048
Was Fischer right or wrong?
 

00:12:32.048 --> 00:12:37.596
How about the top carbon that
has OH on it,

00:12:37.596 --> 00:12:39.048
the HCOH?
 

00:12:39.048 --> 00:12:43.919
Is it the same as in the model
that Bijvoet published?

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:47.350
Does it agree or not?
 

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.470
Yes, it agrees.
 

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.433
The OH is coming out toward you
and to the right,

00:12:52.433 --> 00:12:55.460
same as in Fischer's picture of
the top carbon.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:56.500
Everybody got that?
 

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.960
How about the bottom carbon?
 

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.058
The bottom carbon,
Fischer has it going to the

00:13:02.058 --> 00:13:05.159
left and Bijvoet has it going to
the right;

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:06.320
this one here.
 

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.100
Right?
 

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.759
That's going to the right from
this carbon.

00:13:09.759 --> 00:13:11.360
Fischer's drawing it to the
left.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.360
Do they disagree?
 

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.779
Student:  No.
 

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:18.740
Prof: Who said something?
 

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.309
Do they agree or disagree?
 

00:13:21.309 --> 00:13:23.120
Student:  Agree.
 

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.950
Prof: Seth,
what do you say?

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:34.918
What does Fischer mean by this
bond here, the CH bond?

00:13:34.918 --> 00:13:37.490
Which is it,
going out toward you,

00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:39.049
the H, or back in?
 

00:13:39.049 --> 00:13:42.230
Seth?
 

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:44.288
The Fischer projection,
which is shown here.

00:13:44.288 --> 00:13:46.379
It's got vertical bonds and
horizontal bonds.

00:13:46.379 --> 00:13:49.840
Which one is coming out toward
you, from the carbon?

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.039
Okay.
 

00:13:54.039 --> 00:13:54.840
Somebody else?
 

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.490
Yeah, Kate?
 

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.051
Student:  In a Fischer
projection the bonds are going

00:14:01.051 --> 00:14:01.789
into the board.
 

00:14:01.789 --> 00:14:03.019
Prof: Which bonds?
 

00:14:03.019 --> 00:14:04.440
Student:  The
carbon-carbon bonds.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.509
Prof: The carbon-carbon
bonds are going into the board;

00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:07.808
that's Fischer's convention,
yeah.

00:14:07.808 --> 00:14:10.342
Student:  Because he
twisted them so that everything

00:14:10.342 --> 00:14:12.090
else would be coming out of the
board.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.673
Prof: Yeah,
so these two are coming out of

00:14:13.673 --> 00:14:14.070
the board.
 

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:18.710
How about in Bijvoet's picture?
 

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.690
For the second carbon -- here's
the first one,

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:23.278
here's the second one.
 

00:14:23.278 --> 00:14:25.679
Student:  The OHCs are
going into the board.

00:14:25.679 --> 00:14:26.558
Prof: Ah ha.
 

00:14:26.558 --> 00:14:29.044
So, to make it like Fischer,
you have to rotate it so

00:14:29.044 --> 00:14:30.669
they're coming out of the board.
 

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:31.929
So in fact they do agree.
 

00:14:31.929 --> 00:14:33.580
Right?
 

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:36.666
It's just that Bijvoet's is
made realistically,

00:14:36.666 --> 00:14:40.423
and Fischer's was made with
these rubber tubing bonds and

00:14:40.423 --> 00:14:43.039
you had to bend it to get that
way.

00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:44.669
But it's the same configuration.
 

00:14:44.669 --> 00:14:47.129
So Fischer was right.
 

00:14:47.129 --> 00:14:50.515
So these structures that had
been drawn for sixty years were

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.549
drawn correctly.
 

00:14:51.549 --> 00:14:52.600
Right?
 

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.258
They could've -- it was a 50:50
chance that it could've been the

00:14:55.258 --> 00:14:56.058
other way around.
 

00:14:56.058 --> 00:14:59.279
But thank God he was right,
so we don't have to go back and

00:14:59.279 --> 00:15:01.889
correct everything,
and know whether things were

00:15:01.889 --> 00:15:04.000
written before 1950 or after
1950.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.759
Yeah?
 

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:08.625
Student:  But don't you
think that if you rotate that

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.720
molecule,
isn't the OH that's coming,

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.014
that's like each --
his drawing coming out of the

00:15:13.014 --> 00:15:14.639
board,
doesn't that go back in?

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:17.226
Prof: Okay,
if you rotate this molecule by

00:15:17.226 --> 00:15:19.240
180° around the vertical
axis,

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.567
then this carbon -- with
respect to the carbon we're

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:25.568
interested in here --
this carbon would be going back

00:15:25.568 --> 00:15:28.374
into the board and this carbon
would be going back into the

00:15:28.374 --> 00:15:28.809
board.
 

00:15:28.809 --> 00:15:30.149
That's the way these are.
 

00:15:30.149 --> 00:15:31.230
Right?
 

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.048
But in the process of that
rotation,

00:15:33.048 --> 00:15:36.080
this OH, that was back and to
the right,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.489
after 180°
rotation about the vertical

00:15:38.489 --> 00:15:41.071
axis,
will be out in front and to the

00:15:41.071 --> 00:15:43.106
left;
which is the way it's drawn in

00:15:43.106 --> 00:15:44.408
the Fischer Projection.
 

00:15:44.408 --> 00:15:46.100
Student:  So the other
OH group would be going back in?

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.519
Prof: Yeah,
but you don't care.

00:15:47.519 --> 00:15:49.708
This is just to show the
configuration,

00:15:49.708 --> 00:15:50.168
right?
 

00:15:50.168 --> 00:15:52.750
When you do that rotation,
yeah, these will do the other.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:55.629
But the point is that Fischer's
structure was right,

00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:58.847
with respect to each carbon,
about what's going which way,

00:15:58.847 --> 00:16:00.429
which tetrahedron it is.
 

00:16:00.429 --> 00:16:01.899
Okay, so that's fine.
 

00:16:01.899 --> 00:16:06.115
And then Bijvoet wrote,
or in the same paper he wrote:

00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:10.332
"The question of
nomenclature is beyond the scope

00:16:10.332 --> 00:16:12.798
of our investigation."
 

00:16:12.798 --> 00:16:15.350
(He's just doing the X-ray to
find out which way it is.)

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.080
"The problem of
nomenclature now concerns given

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.663
configurations"
(now you know which one it is

00:16:22.663 --> 00:16:26.467
you want to show) "and
requires a notation which

00:16:26.467 --> 00:16:30.928
denotes these configurations in
an unambiguous and if possible

00:16:30.928 --> 00:16:33.490
self-explanatory way."
 

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:36.259
So you don't need to know how
it was synthesized or anything.

00:16:36.259 --> 00:16:38.808
Now you know how it really is
-- right?

00:16:38.808 --> 00:16:42.277
-- what name are you going to
give to it so people can know,

00:16:42.277 --> 00:16:44.509
just from the name,
which way it is.

00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:48.629
Now, this is related to the
idea of naming configurations

00:16:48.629 --> 00:16:50.470
involving double bonds.
 

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.190
So we're going to first show
you how you do that --

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:57.917
which actually came second --
and then we'll go back to see

00:16:57.917 --> 00:17:01.710
how they named the configuration
at a tetrahedral carbon.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.361
So malic acid,
from apples,

00:17:03.361 --> 00:17:06.665
has that structure shown,
and if you heat it you lose

00:17:06.665 --> 00:17:08.700
water and get a double bond.
 

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:14.460
But you get two isomers,
maleic and fumaric acids.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:17.707
And you'll remember we showed
that before, that van't Hoff

00:17:17.707 --> 00:17:19.358
made those with his models.
 

00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:22.481
And one of them has the two
COHs near one another and one

00:17:22.481 --> 00:17:24.490
has them farther from one
another.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.278
And we can draw them that way
as well;

00:17:27.278 --> 00:17:29.450
near on the left and far on the
right.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:34.573
And if you heat these molecules
further, the one on the left can

00:17:34.573 --> 00:17:38.721
lose water and form an
anhydride, but not the one on

00:17:38.721 --> 00:17:39.859
the right.
 

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:43.680
Why not the one on the right?
 

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.400
It's pretty obvious.
 

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.190
Russell?
 

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.078
Student:  They're too
far apart.

00:17:47.078 --> 00:17:47.930
Prof: They're too far
apart.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.638
So you know which one they're
close together and which one

00:17:50.638 --> 00:17:51.588
they're far apart.
 

00:17:51.588 --> 00:17:54.108
So that experiment proves which
is which.

00:17:54.108 --> 00:17:56.959
It's not as hard as the case of
the right and left-hand,

00:17:56.959 --> 00:17:59.858
where you had to do this very
special X-ray technique.

00:17:59.858 --> 00:18:03.263
So it was known that maleic
acid was the one that can form

00:18:03.263 --> 00:18:05.772
an anhydride,
and therefore had them on the

00:18:05.772 --> 00:18:06.608
same side.
 

00:18:06.608 --> 00:18:10.064
And that was called cis,
meaning on this side of,

00:18:10.064 --> 00:18:12.638
and the other one was called
trans,

00:18:12.638 --> 00:18:13.328
across.
 

00:18:13.328 --> 00:18:17.782
So that was a perfectly good
nomenclature for those two

00:18:17.782 --> 00:18:21.000
isomers of the dehydrated malic
acid.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.950
Maleic was cis and
fumaric acid was trans.

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:28.109
So these names were used for a
very long time,

00:18:28.109 --> 00:18:30.710
but they weren't really good
names.

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.338
And the reason,
you can see,

00:18:32.338 --> 00:18:34.150
by looking at this molecule.
 

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.063
Is this one,
would you call it cis or

00:18:37.063 --> 00:18:38.079
trans?
 

00:18:38.079 --> 00:18:40.130
Same side or opposite side?
 

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.380
Andrew, what do you say?
 

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.549
Student:  I don't know.
 

00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:53.779
Prof: Next Andrew.
 

00:18:53.779 --> 00:18:57.250
This is our nomenclature
problem.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:58.068
Student:  I think
trans.

00:18:58.068 --> 00:19:00.025
Prof: Would you call it
trans,

00:19:00.025 --> 00:19:00.480
you say?
 

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.470
Student:  I would
probably call it --

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.108
Prof: This one here.
 

00:19:05.108 --> 00:19:08.423
Student:  Okay,
that one, I would call it

00:19:08.423 --> 00:19:09.339
cis.
 

00:19:09.339 --> 00:19:10.210
Prof: Why?
 

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:13.108
Student:  Because of the
CH_3's.

00:19:13.108 --> 00:19:15.619
Prof: Because the CH_3's
are next to one another.

00:19:15.619 --> 00:19:16.920
So you might call it cis.
 

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.088
On the other hand,
if you wanted to say how this

00:19:19.088 --> 00:19:21.627
end is related to the acid,
you'd say it's trans,

00:19:21.627 --> 00:19:22.088
right?
 

00:19:22.088 --> 00:19:26.960
So that means it's -- as an
absolute nomenclature,

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.446
it's very hard to generalize
this because you have to know

00:19:29.446 --> 00:19:31.829
which one you're picking,
to say it's cis or

00:19:31.829 --> 00:19:32.480
trans.
 

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.170
It's fine to talk about the
relative configuration,

00:19:36.170 --> 00:19:39.012
to say the methyl on the left
is cis to the methyl on

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:41.626
the right,
or to say the methyl on the

00:19:41.626 --> 00:19:44.130
left is trans to the
COOH.

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:45.240
That's fine.
 

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:48.704
But as to whether to say the
molecule itself is cis or

00:19:48.704 --> 00:19:50.957
trans,
you have to know which one

00:19:50.957 --> 00:19:53.210
you're talking about,
on the right.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.654
So that's another thing where
you're going to have to have

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.529
some convention or something.
 

00:19:58.529 --> 00:20:02.328
And the way people decided to
do it was this.

00:20:02.328 --> 00:20:06.251
You assign the groups at each
end, take one end and then the

00:20:06.251 --> 00:20:09.710
other end of the double bond,
and assign priority.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.715
So you say we're going to give
higher priority to one group or

00:20:12.715 --> 00:20:15.868
the other, and that's the one
we're going to use for the name.

00:20:15.868 --> 00:20:19.700
So on what basis might you
assign a priority to a group;

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.680
to say which group has higher
priority, CH_3 or H?

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.910
Which one do you think should
have higher priority?

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:27.390
Students:  CH_3.
 

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:28.470
Prof: CH_3, okay.
 

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.313
How about on this end,
CH_3 or COOH,

00:20:30.313 --> 00:20:32.210
which should have higher
priority?

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:33.549
Students:  COOH.
 

00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:34.529
Prof: Why?
 

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:35.690
Student:  It's heavier.
 

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:36.710
Prof: It's heavier.
 

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.269
Okay.
 

00:20:38.269 --> 00:20:42.180
Now let's think about how that
is going to work out.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.618
So we'll assign them by atomic
number;

00:20:45.618 --> 00:20:48.029
or atomic weight,
if we have two that are

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:50.200
different isotopes of one
another.

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.210
Right?
 

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:55.458
But we won't sum up the atomic
numbers of all the groups that

00:20:55.458 --> 00:20:59.105
are in that;
that is, we won't sum up C and

00:20:59.105 --> 00:21:01.940
O, and O and H,
and C and 3 Hs.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.797
Why not sum them all up and
then see which one has higher

00:21:04.797 --> 00:21:05.920
total atomic number?
 

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.490
What's wrong with that?
 

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:11.049
Perfectly well-defined.
 

00:21:11.049 --> 00:21:11.970
Student:  It's tedious.
 

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.202
Prof: It's tedious,
it's cumbersome,

00:21:14.202 --> 00:21:15.640
to have to add it all up.
 

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.328
So what rule are you going to
do?

00:21:17.328 --> 00:21:18.838
Student:  Find a
difference.

00:21:18.838 --> 00:21:21.644
Prof: You'll go until
you find a difference,

00:21:21.644 --> 00:21:23.720
go out until you find a
difference.

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.768
Once you find a difference you
stop, so you don't have to go

00:21:26.768 --> 00:21:27.440
everywhere.
 

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.349
Okay.
 

00:21:28.349 --> 00:21:32.759
So at the first difference;
the same as we said with

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:34.848
numbering last time,
right?

00:21:34.848 --> 00:21:36.489
Okay, so on the left,
in each case,

00:21:36.489 --> 00:21:39.334
you have a carbon compared to a
hydrogen as the thing that's

00:21:39.334 --> 00:21:40.538
immediately attached.
 

00:21:40.538 --> 00:21:43.240
Carbon has higher priority,
higher atomic number.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.368
On the right,
it begins with a tie.

00:21:47.368 --> 00:21:50.086
Incidentally,
we're going to have to deal

00:21:50.086 --> 00:21:52.869
with double bonds,
COOH, at the bottom.

00:21:52.869 --> 00:21:53.480
Right?
 

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.612
The way you do it,
just by convention,

00:21:55.612 --> 00:21:58.782
there's nothing -- God didn't
write this on the tablets,

00:21:58.782 --> 00:21:59.358
right?
 

00:21:59.358 --> 00:22:03.180
It's -- you just pretend that
there are two of those atoms,

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:06.190
when there's a double bond;
just pretend.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:09.430
Okay, so now we compare the top
with the bottom.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.059
If we go to the first step,
it's carbon versus carbon.

00:22:13.059 --> 00:22:13.930
It's a tie.
 

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:15.970
So we're going to have to go
further.

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.464
When we go to the next level we
see on the left it's oxygen

00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:20.549
versus hydrogen.
 

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:22.039
Right?
 

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:23.210
And oxygen is higher.
 

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:25.396
We don't have to go any
further, we've found a

00:22:25.396 --> 00:22:26.029
difference.
 

00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:27.319
So forget the rest of it.
 

00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:28.480
Everybody with me?
 

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.593
Okay, so we might say the one
on the left is trans and

00:22:32.593 --> 00:22:35.130
the one on the right is
cis.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.202
However, people,
for sixty years,

00:22:38.202 --> 00:22:41.809
or longer in this case,
have been using the names

00:22:41.809 --> 00:22:44.430
cis and trans to
mean one thing or another,

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.568
and sometimes we'll agree with
them and sometimes we don't;

00:22:47.568 --> 00:22:51.688
which is going to cause great
confusion as to whether you're

00:22:51.688 --> 00:22:54.828
using a pre-1950 name or a
post-1950 name,

00:22:54.828 --> 00:22:57.240
and at least half the compounds
are going to be wrong.

00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.269
Right?
 

00:22:58.269 --> 00:23:01.944
So the names trans and
cis have been polluted by

00:23:01.944 --> 00:23:02.970
previous usage.
 

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:04.789
So we're going to have to have
new names.

00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:06.170
Yeah Lucas?
 

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:07.578
Student:  You don't
really have --

00:23:07.578 --> 00:23:09.788
in the second part of the
double bond,

00:23:09.788 --> 00:23:11.824
as a substituent,
and that itself is like

00:23:11.824 --> 00:23:13.298
cis or trans.
 

00:23:13.298 --> 00:23:15.673
Prof: You'd mirror all
-- you'd duplicate all those as

00:23:15.673 --> 00:23:15.950
well.
 

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:16.539
Student:  Okay.
 

00:23:16.539 --> 00:23:17.410
Prof: Okay.
 

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:20.259
Okay, so this one was used with
a German root,

00:23:20.259 --> 00:23:23.363
because the guys from
Switzerland were doing this,

00:23:23.363 --> 00:23:25.960
entgegen,
which means opposed.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.670
And the one on the right,
so it's E when they're

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.577
trans,
when they're opposite one

00:23:30.577 --> 00:23:31.180
another.
 

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.787
And when they're adjacent to
one another it's called

00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:35.730
together, zusammen,
Z.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:39.210
I've always thought this is a
real pity that it wasn't the

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:40.368
other way around.
 

00:23:40.368 --> 00:23:42.279
So I hope this doesn't confuse
you.

00:23:42.279 --> 00:23:46.410
Because these are on the same
side and these are on opposite

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:46.970
sides.
 

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.088
Right?
 

00:23:48.088 --> 00:23:50.410
But it's just backwards from
that.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:52.109
So just remember that it's
unfortunate.

00:23:52.109 --> 00:23:53.328
Okay?
 

00:23:53.328 --> 00:23:56.130
So Z means together and
E means apart.

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.858
Okay, that's the name we use
for there.

00:23:59.858 --> 00:24:02.300
Okay, now notice that in
assigning priority,

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.026
as we said, just to belabor
this is a little bit,

00:24:05.026 --> 00:24:07.068
you proceed one shell at a
time.

00:24:07.068 --> 00:24:10.247
So we saw a tie when it was
carbon versus carbon,

00:24:10.247 --> 00:24:13.690
and when it was three oxygens
versus three hydrogens,

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.140
it was obvious that the top
wins.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:19.890
But now let's go to this case.
 

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.950
Okay, now carbon versus carbon,
that's a tie.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:26.470
We go out further,
three oxygens beat a carbon and

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:27.619
two hydrogens.
 

00:24:27.619 --> 00:24:29.009
Right?
 

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:31.880
But there are chlorines on the
bottom.

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.509
Right?
 

00:24:33.509 --> 00:24:35.539
The chlorine is really high
priority.

00:24:35.539 --> 00:24:36.680
Right?
 

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.574
But it's irrelevant,
because the decision has

00:24:39.574 --> 00:24:40.890
already been made.
 

00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:44.109
So you respect earlier
decisions.

00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:45.068
Right?
 

00:24:45.068 --> 00:24:47.380
You only go as far as you need
to go, to see a difference.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.490
Okay, I think we've said that
enough.

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:53.115
Now these are the guys that
invented the scheme to name

00:24:53.115 --> 00:24:53.990
handedness.
 

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:58.308
It's called the CIP Priority
Scheme.

00:24:58.308 --> 00:25:04.396
And the C is R.S. Cahn,
and the I is C.K. Ingold --

00:25:04.396 --> 00:25:11.823
both of them are from Britain --
and the P is Vladimir Prelog,

00:25:11.823 --> 00:25:17.423
who's in Switzerland,
although he's a native of

00:25:17.423 --> 00:25:19.980
Yugoslavia.
 

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.479
Now, these were -- many people,
particularly synthetic

00:25:23.479 --> 00:25:27.506
chemists, would consider Robert
Robinson and R.B. Woodward the

00:25:27.506 --> 00:25:30.940
greatest organic chemists of the
20th century.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.997
They both thought they were
probably the greatest individual

00:25:34.997 --> 00:25:35.410
one.
 

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:36.220
Right?
 

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.933
So I love this picture,
taken by Jack Roberts of them

00:25:39.933 --> 00:25:44.363
at a seminar at MIT around this
same time, because they sort of

00:25:44.363 --> 00:25:46.650
aren't looking at one other.
 

00:25:46.650 --> 00:25:47.180
Right?
 

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.450
What's Robinson looking at?
 

00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:54.134
Robinson is looking at Ingold,
whom he really despised,

00:25:54.134 --> 00:25:55.609
and vice-versa.
 

00:25:55.609 --> 00:25:56.960
All right?
 

00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.970
There was no love lost between
Ingold and Robinson.

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:06.818
And this is illustrated by an
account that Prelog gave in his

00:26:06.818 --> 00:26:08.380
autobiography.
 

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:13.308
He encountered Robinson in the
airport in Zurich.

00:26:13.308 --> 00:26:15.990
Robinson was on his way to a
meeting in Israel.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:18.278
Robinson: "Hello
Katchalsky.

00:26:18.278 --> 00:26:19.778
What are you doing here in
Zurich?"

00:26:19.778 --> 00:26:24.380
Prelog: "Excuse me,
Sir Robert, I am only Prelog;

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.160
I live here."
 

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:28.298
(He got a Nobel Prize too,
Prelog.)

00:26:28.298 --> 00:26:30.630
"I am only Prelog and I
live here."

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:35.523
Robinson: "You know
Prelog, your and Ingold's

00:26:35.523 --> 00:26:40.118
configurational notation is all
wrong."

00:26:40.118 --> 00:26:42.859
Prelog: "Sir Robert,
it can't be wrong.

00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:44.259
It is just a convention.
 

00:26:44.259 --> 00:26:47.578
You either accept it or
not."

00:26:47.578 --> 00:26:50.001
Robinson: "Well then if
it's not wrong,

00:26:50.001 --> 00:26:52.029
it's absolutely
unnecessary."

00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:53.410
Okay?
 

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:57.588
So anyhow, the point of this
slide is that it's a convention.

00:26:57.588 --> 00:26:59.210
There's not right and wrong
about it.

00:26:59.210 --> 00:27:02.203
It's that they propose rules,
and those are the rules that

00:27:02.203 --> 00:27:03.358
people have adopted.
 

00:27:03.358 --> 00:27:07.378
And that's how you give a name
to the absolute configuration of

00:27:07.378 --> 00:27:08.868
a stereogenic carbon.
 

00:27:08.868 --> 00:27:10.883
And for fun,
for Wednesday,

00:27:10.883 --> 00:27:15.701
you can try this exercise,
going back to this medieval

00:27:15.701 --> 00:27:19.252
manuscript,
and using the figures in it to

00:27:19.252 --> 00:27:23.108
devise your own convention to
describe chirality.

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:27.297
So you can put yourself in the
position of Cahn,

00:27:27.297 --> 00:27:29.078
Ingold and Prelog.
 

00:27:29.078 --> 00:27:32.655
Okay, so here's the
Cahn-Ingold-Prelog R/S

00:27:32.655 --> 00:27:36.670
nomenclature scheme for
stereogenic centers.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:40.189
First you have to decide on
each of these carbons -- which

00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:42.905
are mirror images,
you see, of one another --

00:27:42.905 --> 00:27:45.130
which atoms have which priority.
 

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.680
So let's start on the left.
 

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:51.026
What's the highest priority for
a substituent on the central

00:27:51.026 --> 00:27:51.690
carbon?
 

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:52.789
There are four groups.
 

00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:55.579
Which has the highest priority?
 

00:27:55.579 --> 00:27:56.970
Student:  OH.
 

00:27:56.970 --> 00:27:58.339
Prof: Which one?
 

00:27:58.339 --> 00:27:59.319
Student:  OH.
 

00:27:59.319 --> 00:28:00.548
Prof: Zack?
 

00:28:00.548 --> 00:28:02.490
Student:  I thought it
was OH.

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.250
Prof: OH.
 

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.680
Yeah O is the highest atomic
number.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:06.259
What's the lowest?
 

00:28:06.259 --> 00:28:07.289
Student:  H.
 

00:28:07.289 --> 00:28:09.039
Prof: H, right?
 

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:12.609
There's also a D there.
 

00:28:12.609 --> 00:28:16.960
It's the same atomic number;
hydrogen and deuterium.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.349
Which one should be higher?
 

00:28:19.349 --> 00:28:20.868
Students:  Deuterium.
 

00:28:20.868 --> 00:28:21.798
Prof: Deuterium's
heavier.

00:28:21.798 --> 00:28:23.720
If it's isotopes,
you take the heavier one.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.820
Okay, so here's one,
four, three,

00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.589
two.
 

00:28:28.589 --> 00:28:29.839
Right?
 

00:28:29.839 --> 00:28:34.660
That's the priorities;
and analogously on the right.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:38.335
And now we have to decide
whether they're -- which one to

00:28:38.335 --> 00:28:40.960
call right and which one to call
left.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:45.077
And the way you do it,
one way of doing it,

00:28:45.077 --> 00:28:50.077
is to take a thing like this
where I have these red,

00:28:50.077 --> 00:28:52.430
yellow, green,
blue;

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:53.912
red, orange,
yellow, green,

00:28:53.912 --> 00:28:56.045
blue, right;
the order of the spectrum,

00:28:56.045 --> 00:28:57.380
red, yellow,
green, blue.

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.712
And I make a spiral that
connects them,

00:28:59.712 --> 00:29:00.450
like that.
 

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:05.074
And now, is that conventionally
what you call a right-handed or

00:29:05.074 --> 00:29:06.788
a left-handed spiral?
 

00:29:06.788 --> 00:29:09.786
You know, if you look at it,
if I turned it like this,

00:29:09.786 --> 00:29:11.200
it would move this way.
 

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:12.038
Right?
 

00:29:12.038 --> 00:29:16.173
So screws are called
right-handed and left-handed

00:29:16.173 --> 00:29:16.950
screws.
 

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:21.542
And the reason is that the --
you know, toe-bone connected to

00:29:21.542 --> 00:29:23.838
the foot-bone kind of thing.
 

00:29:23.838 --> 00:29:26.733
The way your arm is put
together, for right-handed

00:29:26.733 --> 00:29:29.569
people it's easier to drive a
screw like this.

00:29:29.569 --> 00:29:29.740
Right?
 

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.828
So that's conventionally called
a right-handed screw.

00:29:32.828 --> 00:29:35.089
So this you would call
right-handed.

00:29:35.089 --> 00:29:36.440
Okay?
 

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.929
Now, if you can't remember from
how to turn a screwdriver,

00:29:39.929 --> 00:29:43.480
you can look at -- you can do
this trick with your hand.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:47.106
You put your thumb along the
direction of the lowest

00:29:47.106 --> 00:29:49.618
priority;
hydrogen, in this case.

00:29:49.618 --> 00:29:51.220
So it's coming out of the
board, right?

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.500
And you curl your fingers.
 

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:55.588
Right?
 

00:29:55.588 --> 00:29:58.690
And you notice it goes one,
two, three, and then four.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:01.980
So that one on the left is
left-handed.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:03.180
Everybody see how I did that?
 

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.537
Curl your fingers,
they go one,

00:30:05.537 --> 00:30:07.029
two, three, four.
 

00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:08.579
Okay?
 

00:30:08.579 --> 00:30:10.269
So that's a left-handed one.
 

00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:13.141
The one on the right,
if you do it this way,

00:30:13.141 --> 00:30:14.410
you -- so that's.
 

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.407
And you call it,
not left, you call it S,

00:30:17.407 --> 00:30:19.450
for the Latin sinister.
 

00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:21.605
So it's not going to get
confused with D and

00:30:21.605 --> 00:30:23.759
L and so on,
that have already been used.

00:30:23.759 --> 00:30:25.160
It's a new way of doing it.
 

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.548
So that one's S.
 

00:30:26.548 --> 00:30:30.382
And the one on the right,
if I put my thumb so it goes

00:30:30.382 --> 00:30:33.131
back toward the H,
and curl my fingers,

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:35.589
I go from one to two to three.
 

00:30:35.589 --> 00:30:36.808
Okay?
 

00:30:36.808 --> 00:30:39.650
So that one is called R
for rectus;

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:41.839
Latin for right.
 

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:43.108
Okay?
 

00:30:43.108 --> 00:30:45.740
Now there's another -- there
are lots of tricks to do this.

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:47.940
If you don't like doing it that
way, you can do it this way.

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:51.674
Pretend that this is a steering
wheel of a car,

00:30:51.674 --> 00:30:54.029
and the H is going back in.
 

00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:55.640
Right?
 

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.491
So here I'm -- this one on the
right -- I'm sitting here

00:30:58.491 --> 00:31:01.500
driving a car like this and the
H is going away from me.

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:02.848
Everybody got that?
 

00:31:02.848 --> 00:31:05.670
And I notice that I go one,
two, three.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:07.528
Right?
 

00:31:07.528 --> 00:31:09.849
That's going to turn the car to
the right.

00:31:09.849 --> 00:31:11.970
Everybody see that?
 

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:16.194
So, and this one will turn the
car to the left,

00:31:16.194 --> 00:31:20.329
if I turn the wheel to go from
O to C to D.

00:31:20.329 --> 00:31:22.140
Okay?
 

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:25.670
So that one's a left turn and
that one's a right turn.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.170
So whatever works for you is
fine.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:31.226
And I can assure you that on
some test I'm going to look out

00:31:31.226 --> 00:31:33.920
and see people with their papers
there and so on,

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.049
and they're going to be going
like this.

00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:35.838
Right?
 

00:31:35.838 --> 00:31:37.339
Because it's a handy way to do
it.

00:31:37.339 --> 00:31:38.480
&gt;
 

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.230
Handy.
 

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.200
&gt;
 

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.279
Okay, so let's try it on
tartaric acid.

00:31:43.279 --> 00:31:46.650
Here, let's do the top carbon
of tartaric acid.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:48.578
Okay?
 

00:31:48.578 --> 00:31:52.288
So we've got to decide on the
priority of the groups here.

00:31:52.288 --> 00:31:53.815
Here's one group,
another group,

00:31:53.815 --> 00:31:55.339
another group,
another group.

00:31:55.339 --> 00:31:56.509
Which is the highest priority?
 

00:31:56.509 --> 00:31:57.828
Student:  OH.
 

00:31:57.828 --> 00:31:59.829
Prof: OH is the highest,
right?

00:31:59.829 --> 00:32:00.660
O is the highest.
 

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.509
Now we got two carbons that are
tied.

00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:04.869
Which one's going to win,
top or bottom?

00:32:04.869 --> 00:32:05.839
Student:  Top.
 

00:32:05.839 --> 00:32:08.269
Prof: Top you say Kate?
 

00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.940
Why?
 

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.038
Student:  A tie.
 

00:32:10.038 --> 00:32:13.265
Student:  Because it has
-- well we can pretend three

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:15.778
oxygens, whereas the bottom one
has a hydrogen,

00:32:15.778 --> 00:32:17.308
a carbon, and an oxygen.
 

00:32:17.308 --> 00:32:18.500
Prof: And only one
oxygen, right?

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.621
So the one on the top has --
not more oxygens,

00:32:21.621 --> 00:32:23.980
but it's got the oxygens
nearer.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.230
Okay?
 

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:26.720
So we don't have to go as far.
 

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.358
So this is going to be one,
two, three, four.

00:32:30.358 --> 00:32:34.288
Okay, now let me see your hands
operating.

00:32:34.288 --> 00:32:37.868
Put a thumb along the H,
the direction the H goes,

00:32:37.868 --> 00:32:42.630
and curl your hands one,
right, top,

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:45.180
bottom, one,
two, three, and tell me whether

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.960
that's right or left-handed?
 

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:57.329
Okay?
 

00:32:57.329 --> 00:33:00.619
How many think left?
 

00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:02.538
How many think right?
 

00:33:02.538 --> 00:33:04.299
This is a democracy,
the rights have it;

00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:05.470
they're also correct.
 

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:09.990
Okay, that one's one,
four, two, three.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.930
Okay, that, it's right-handed.
 

00:33:12.930 --> 00:33:14.838
And the bottom one's also
right-handed.

00:33:14.838 --> 00:33:17.653
Why didn't I have to take a lot
of time to have you do this,

00:33:17.653 --> 00:33:18.750
to do the bottom one?
 

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:23.058
Why does the bottom one follow,
if you know the top one?

00:33:23.058 --> 00:33:25.213
Because you can rotate the
thing 180°

00:33:25.213 --> 00:33:27.692
and it's the same,
and that will change the top

00:33:27.692 --> 00:33:28.769
into the bottom.
 

00:33:28.769 --> 00:33:31.400
So whatever the top is,
the bottom's the same thing.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.303
So the name of this is,
in parentheses,

00:33:34.303 --> 00:33:37.358
(2R, -- carbon two is
R;

00:33:37.358 --> 00:33:42.367
carbon three is also R),
then dash (-),

00:33:42.367 --> 00:33:45.930
2,3-dihydroxybutanedioic acid.
 

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:48.848
Okay, so now we have a scheme
that does that.

00:33:48.848 --> 00:33:54.480
And notice, this is the gate
into the new Chemistry building,

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:58.167
just up Prospect Street,
and it's got things that relate

00:33:58.167 --> 00:34:01.318
to the different branches of
chemistry on it.

00:34:01.318 --> 00:34:05.248
And this one is those carbon
tetrahedra with the spiral on it

00:34:05.248 --> 00:34:07.538
that says which handedness it
is.

00:34:07.538 --> 00:34:10.320
There are both right and
left-handed ones there.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.920
Okay.
 

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.849
Now, racemization.
 

00:34:14.849 --> 00:34:18.286
If you start with a molecule,
which maybe you've gotten from

00:34:18.286 --> 00:34:20.516
nature,
that's all one hand,

00:34:20.516 --> 00:34:24.125
like lactic acid,
from milk, (R)-lactic

00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:28.653
acid, there are processes which
convert it into a 50:50 mixture

00:34:28.653 --> 00:34:30.699
of R and S.
 

00:34:30.699 --> 00:34:34.063
For example,
suppose you had a base and it

00:34:34.063 --> 00:34:36.360
could pull off a hydrogen.
 

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.893
What hydrogen would it pull off
from this molecule,

00:34:39.893 --> 00:34:40.530
a base?
 

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:44.079
Any idea?
 

00:34:44.079 --> 00:34:48.360
What is the most reactive group
here?

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:50.409
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:52.889
Prof: Or another way of
saying it, this is a high HOMO.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:55.010
What's the low LUMO going to be?
 

00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:58.239
Well there's several low LUMOS.
 

00:34:58.239 --> 00:35:01.300
There's the CO double bond,
π*.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.130
That's a good one, right?
 

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.768
However, it won't get you
anyplace.

00:35:04.768 --> 00:35:06.309
You can put it on,
come off again.

00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:07.190
Okay?
 

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:11.090
Or there's σ* OH
here, but there's also

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.079
σ* OH here.
 

00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:17.179
But this one's better because
it's next to the π*.

00:35:17.179 --> 00:35:17.929
Right?
 

00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:19.730
So this -- that's why it's
called an acid.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:20.610
You already knew that.
 

00:35:20.610 --> 00:35:23.889
And you can lose the H+ and get
down to this.

00:35:23.889 --> 00:35:26.628
Okay, and that'll go on off,
on off, on off,

00:35:26.628 --> 00:35:27.518
a long time.
 

00:35:27.518 --> 00:35:29.130
That's fine,
nothing special there.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:33.108
But once in a long while --
that's easy to do -- once in a

00:35:33.108 --> 00:35:36.670
long while you might pull off
the wrong hydrogen;

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:38.409
you might pull off this one.
 

00:35:38.409 --> 00:35:40.539
Right?
 

00:35:40.539 --> 00:35:42.360
So that's not nearly as easy.
 

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:45.619
But when it happens it's
interesting, for two reasons.

00:35:45.619 --> 00:35:48.360
One is, it's not as bad as you
might've thought,

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:51.559
because it's adjacent to this
π*,

00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:55.545
which means that the vacant
orbital here can stabilize that

00:35:55.545 --> 00:35:56.369
high HOMO.
 

00:35:56.369 --> 00:35:57.309
Right?
 

00:35:57.309 --> 00:36:00.945
Which means you can draw that
resonance structure,

00:36:00.945 --> 00:36:02.949
with a double bond there.
 

00:36:02.949 --> 00:36:05.789
So it's hard,
but it's not as hard as it

00:36:05.789 --> 00:36:06.590
might be.
 

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:12.123
Once in awhile that'll happen,
and usually it'll go back

00:36:12.123 --> 00:36:12.929
again.
 

00:36:12.929 --> 00:36:14.730
Right?
 

00:36:14.730 --> 00:36:18.918
But what's especially
interesting -- well just as a

00:36:18.918 --> 00:36:23.190
footnote, it's possible to pull
both of them off.

00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:25.931
But that would be very unusual,
to make a di-anion,

00:36:25.931 --> 00:36:28.891
which is high in energy,
because you're putting so many

00:36:28.891 --> 00:36:30.809
electrons close to one another.
 

00:36:30.809 --> 00:36:31.969
Okay?
 

00:36:31.969 --> 00:36:36.157
But what's relevant for our
purposes is that that molecule

00:36:36.157 --> 00:36:37.039
is planar.
 

00:36:37.039 --> 00:36:39.150
So it's not handed.
 

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:44.603
This one had a chiral carbon in
it, but this one doesn't have an

00:36:44.603 --> 00:36:48.239
asymmetric carbon,
a stereogenic carbon.

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:50.077
So this one,
the one in the middle,

00:36:50.077 --> 00:36:51.590
is neither right nor left.
 

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:55.498
So if you go from right to
something that isn't right or

00:36:55.498 --> 00:36:58.840
left, you can come back,
put the hydrogen on.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.826
The hydrogen comes from the
front of the screen,

00:37:00.826 --> 00:37:03.150
goes on to where the minus
charge is, and you're back to

00:37:03.150 --> 00:37:03.699
the left.
 

00:37:03.699 --> 00:37:06.610
But the hydrogen could've come
from the back of the screen,

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:08.829
at the same carbon,
and that would give the one on

00:37:08.829 --> 00:37:11.077
the right,
and would be (S)-lactic

00:37:11.077 --> 00:37:11.409
acid.
 

00:37:11.409 --> 00:37:14.322
So after a long time of
heating, with base,

00:37:14.322 --> 00:37:18.070
you can take one that's all
R and have it become

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.360
50:50, R and S.
 

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:22.809
And that process is called
racemization.

00:37:22.809 --> 00:37:27.860
Why would it be called
racemization?

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.889
Because it makes a racemic
mixture;

00:37:29.889 --> 00:37:32.159
a 50:50 mixture from something
that was pure.

00:37:32.159 --> 00:37:33.730
Okay, that's interesting.
 

00:37:33.730 --> 00:37:38.585
But what may be more
interesting is -- well this is

00:37:38.585 --> 00:37:41.110
just a footnote on that.
 

00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.710
If you here,
to go from

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:46.858
(R,R)-tartaric
acid, to meso-tartaric

00:37:46.858 --> 00:37:50.059
acid, you change just one such
hydrogen.

00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:54.239
The one here has been taken off
and put back on the other side,

00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:55.518
to give that one.
 

00:37:55.518 --> 00:38:00.336
So that's not racemization,
you're not going to a 50:50

00:38:00.336 --> 00:38:03.369
mixture of the two hands,
right?

00:38:03.369 --> 00:38:04.190
So it has a different name.
 

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:05.860
It's called epimerization.
 

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:08.429
That's just for vocabulary.
 

00:38:08.429 --> 00:38:12.592
But what's more interesting
than racemization is the

00:38:12.592 --> 00:38:17.409
reverse, to start with a 50:50
mixture and go to all one.

00:38:17.409 --> 00:38:21.237
And that's the main subject for
the rest of what we're going to

00:38:21.237 --> 00:38:23.460
be talking about,
before the exam.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.500
Okay, so you start with
(R,S) and you

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:32.349
separate it into R and
S, in separate vials.

00:38:32.349 --> 00:38:34.260
So you have just the one you
want.

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:39.449
Okay, one way we've already
seen of doing that was Pasteur.

00:38:39.449 --> 00:38:45.003
A conglomerate is a mixture of
crystals where each crystal is

00:38:45.003 --> 00:38:48.429
all one hand or all the other
hand;

00:38:48.429 --> 00:38:51.518
but it's a 50:50 mixture of
such crystals.

00:38:51.518 --> 00:38:54.510
So there's no net handedness to
it.

00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:55.559
Right?
 

00:38:55.559 --> 00:38:58.731
But then if you,
if you have a situation like

00:38:58.731 --> 00:39:00.914
that --
notice you wouldn't have that,

00:39:00.914 --> 00:39:03.268
if the crystals had a
right-handed molecule,

00:39:03.268 --> 00:39:05.599
and then a left-handed,
and then a right-handed,

00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:07.985
and then a left-handed;
you couldn't pick it apart

00:39:07.985 --> 00:39:10.530
because you can't separate one
molecule from another.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:11.300
Right?
 

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.735
But if all crystals are
right-handed,

00:39:13.735 --> 00:39:17.050
and some crystals are all
left-handed -- right?

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:18.989
-- then in principle you can
pick them apart.

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:22.469
And that's precisely what
Pasteur did when he noticed it.

00:39:22.469 --> 00:39:23.239
Right?
 

00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:24.889
So you can separate them.
 

00:39:24.889 --> 00:39:30.179
And there are tricks that can
help you do it even better,

00:39:30.179 --> 00:39:33.170
or more easily,
when the crystals --

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:36.159
when the things crystallize as
all right-handed or all

00:39:36.159 --> 00:39:36.949
left-handed.
 

00:39:36.949 --> 00:39:41.369
One is to start with molecules
in solution and have only one

00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:45.789
form crystallize and have the
other one stay in solution.

00:39:45.789 --> 00:39:47.929
Then all you have to do is
filter it.

00:39:47.929 --> 00:39:49.489
Okay?
 

00:39:49.489 --> 00:39:50.940
And how can you do that?
 

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.813
It's because -- and
chiral-resolved poison is

00:39:53.813 --> 00:39:57.081
another one, which will keep one
form from growing,

00:39:57.081 --> 00:39:59.630
so that only one form
crystallizes.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:00.659
How do you do that?
 

00:40:00.659 --> 00:40:03.079
Here's a crystal which is in
solution.

00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:05.500
And suppose it's exactly at
equilibrium;

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:10.179
so it neither dissolves nor
crystallizes.

00:40:10.179 --> 00:40:12.139
It's exactly at equilibrium,
it's saturated.

00:40:12.139 --> 00:40:15.333
Okay, now the interior
molecules of the crystal are

00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:19.360
very stable, because they have
exactly the right environment.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.210
Right?
 

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.469
They're more stable than the
ones in solution.

00:40:22.469 --> 00:40:25.266
The ones on the surface are not
so stable, because they don't

00:40:25.266 --> 00:40:27.690
have the neighbors -- all the
neighbors they need.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:28.610
Right?
 

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:32.639
But the average molecule is
exactly the same as in solution.

00:40:32.639 --> 00:40:35.173
So it just sits there,
it's at equilibrium with

00:40:35.173 --> 00:40:35.780
solution.
 

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:38.809
Now, so that's the situation we
have.

00:40:38.809 --> 00:40:40.657
That's the temperature and
concentration,

00:40:40.657 --> 00:40:43.570
so that this crystal is exactly
at equilibrium with solution.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:46.989
Now suppose that you had a
smaller crystal.

00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:50.760
Would it also be at equilibrium
with solution;

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.280
if it were smaller?
 

00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.070
Or do you see any difference?
 

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:06.702
The smaller one has a higher
fraction of molecules on the

00:41:06.702 --> 00:41:07.710
surface.
 

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.250
Okay?
 

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.550
What does that mean?
 

00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:17.219
The molecules on the surface
are less stable than the ones

00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:17.800
inside.
 

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:22.994
If the average molecule here is
precisely the same as the ones

00:41:22.994 --> 00:41:27.849
in solution, so it just sits
there, how about this one?

00:41:27.849 --> 00:41:31.362
The average molecule is less
stable than the ones in

00:41:31.362 --> 00:41:32.119
solution.
 

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:33.380
So what will it do?
 

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:35.760
Student:  It'll dissolve.
 

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.789
Prof: It'll dissolve.
 

00:41:36.789 --> 00:41:40.079
Okay, so a small one dissolves.
 

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:42.570
This one just sits here.
 

00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:44.679
So that'll go away.
 

00:41:44.679 --> 00:41:48.257
And so as time goes on it gets
smaller and smaller,

00:41:48.257 --> 00:41:49.690
the faces move in.
 

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:52.449
How about this one,
what will it do?

00:41:52.449 --> 00:41:53.420
Student:  It'll grow.
 

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:56.693
Prof: It'll grow,
because it's more stable in

00:41:56.693 --> 00:41:57.400
solution.
 

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:58.139
Right?
 

00:41:58.139 --> 00:41:59.789
Bingo.
 

00:41:59.789 --> 00:42:02.179
So that one grows,
that small one shrinks.

00:42:02.179 --> 00:42:06.110
And this one in the middle is
called the -- is metastable.

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:09.480
We defined it as being stable,
as just sitting there.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.940
Right?
 

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:12.050
But it's metastable.
 

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:13.570
If it gets any smaller it'll
shrink.

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:14.889
If it gets any larger it'll
grow.

00:42:14.889 --> 00:42:15.869
Right?
 

00:42:15.869 --> 00:42:18.675
So you have to get a crystal
that size, called the

00:42:18.675 --> 00:42:21.940
"critical size"
before the crystal will grow.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.690
Right?
 

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:28.018
So this suggests a way of
getting only one form to grow.

00:42:28.018 --> 00:42:30.494
You have a solution,
that's racemic,

00:42:30.494 --> 00:42:31.059
50:50.
 

00:42:31.059 --> 00:42:32.449
Right?
 

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:35.222
But there are no crystals in
there that are big enough to

00:42:35.222 --> 00:42:35.570
grow.
 

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:37.518
Can you see what you can do?
 

00:42:37.518 --> 00:42:41.820
You add a little fairy dust,
right?

00:42:41.820 --> 00:42:47.090
Powdered crystal of one of the
two forms, but have them be big

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:48.559
enough to grow.
 

00:42:48.559 --> 00:42:50.610
So only those will grow.
 

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:53.849
And then you can filter it and
you have just that one.

00:42:53.849 --> 00:42:57.389
And that's done industrially,
as a way of getting just one

00:42:57.389 --> 00:43:01.349
form, to separate the two forms;
a means of resolution.

00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:04.936
Okay, and the other way is to
add a poison that will absorb on

00:43:04.936 --> 00:43:06.760
one and keep it from growing.
 

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:10.820
Okay, so that's one way that's
actually used industrially,

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.530
as well as in the lab.
 

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:17.590
Another way is to form
temporary diastereomers.

00:43:17.590 --> 00:43:20.445
Because remember,
the right and the left are

00:43:20.445 --> 00:43:21.510
mirror images.
 

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:23.550
So almost all their properties
are the same;

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:24.730
like their solubility.
 

00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:25.730
Okay?
 

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.210
But suppose you put something
else with it.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:36.679
Like here, let's shake hands
Josh.

00:43:36.679 --> 00:43:39.300
Here, does that feel normal?
 

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:39.570
Student:  No.
 

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:39.679
&gt;
 

00:43:39.679 --> 00:43:41.510
Prof: It feels weird,
right?

00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:42.210
Student:  Very weird.
 

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:42.710
Prof: That feels good.
 

00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:45.360
So right with right is
different from right with left.

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:46.250
Right?
 

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.070
It's a different property.
 

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:48.429
Okay?
 

00:43:48.429 --> 00:43:51.998
So if what I did was make
diastereomers by adding

00:43:51.998 --> 00:43:54.750
something else to these
molecules,

00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:58.840
which itself is only one hand,
like right,

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.079
now I'll have things that
reacted that are right with

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:04.081
right,
and things that are reacted

00:44:04.081 --> 00:44:04.989
right with left.
 

00:44:04.989 --> 00:44:07.579
And what's the relationship
between those new things?

00:44:07.579 --> 00:44:09.670
Are they enantiomers?
 

00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:12.614
Right with right,
right with left,

00:44:12.614 --> 00:44:15.739
and now I'm comparing RR with
RS.

00:44:15.739 --> 00:44:16.860
What's the relation?
 

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:17.489
Are they mirror images?
 

00:44:17.489 --> 00:44:18.739
Student:  No.
 

00:44:18.739 --> 00:44:19.690
Prof: No,
they're not mirror images.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:20.480
They're just different.
 

00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:23.085
They're different solubility,
different boiling point --

00:44:23.085 --> 00:44:25.690
everything will be different --
different reactivity.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.170
Right?
 

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:29.599
So on the basis of that I can
separate them.

00:44:29.599 --> 00:44:33.617
But if I did it in such a way
that now I can remove that thing

00:44:33.617 --> 00:44:36.911
I added, now after the
separation I can go back and

00:44:36.911 --> 00:44:39.480
have the original things
separated.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:40.090
Okay?
 

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:41.820
So temporary diastereomers.
 

00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:43.730
One way to do it is
chromatography.

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:47.076
So the stuff that I put in the
chromatography column can be all

00:44:47.076 --> 00:44:47.670
one hand.
 

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:51.414
I put the new stuff on --
that's the packing of the

00:44:51.414 --> 00:44:52.090
column.
 

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:53.949
I now run stuff through it.
 

00:44:53.949 --> 00:44:57.360
One absorbs more strongly than
the other, doesn't move as fast.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.210
So one will come out the bottom
of the column faster.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:02.840
That's one way of making
temporary diastereomers;

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:06.829
or making a compound with a
chiral-resolved mate.

00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:11.090
Okay, for example,
this allenic compound that we

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:15.349
saw before that proved van't
Hoff was right,

00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:17.519
this is how it was actually
resolved,

00:45:17.519 --> 00:45:18.619
how it was separated.
 

00:45:18.619 --> 00:45:21.130
So it says at the top they used
alkaloids.

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:24.664
An alkaloid is an organic base,
isolated from plants,

00:45:24.664 --> 00:45:27.518
and the plants made only one
hand of it.

00:45:27.518 --> 00:45:31.327
And so you use it to make a
diastereomeric salt with a

00:45:31.327 --> 00:45:34.849
racemic mixture of right and
left-handed acids.

00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:37.697
So now you have two salts --
right-right salt and right-left

00:45:37.697 --> 00:45:39.967
salt -- and they'll have
different solubilities,

00:45:39.967 --> 00:45:41.320
and you can crystallize.
 

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.420
So here's what happened.
 

00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.940
There's brucine;
that's one of these alkaloids.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.739
And you see it has all those
centers, stereogenic centers.

00:45:48.739 --> 00:45:50.184
So it's chiral,
just one hand,

00:45:50.184 --> 00:45:51.829
because you got it from nature.
 

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:56.019
And now you mix 4.7 grams of
the acid and 5.2 grams of

00:45:56.019 --> 00:46:00.369
brucine, which means that there
is about a 1:1 ratio.

00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:01.849
So you have both salts there.
 

00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:05.518
And now you crystallize,
you get a solid salt,

00:46:05.518 --> 00:46:09.759
and it weighed 4 grams,
which means you got 42% yield

00:46:09.759 --> 00:46:10.820
-- right?
 

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:12.199
-- about half of the stuff out.
 

00:46:12.199 --> 00:46:15.367
And that stuff then you -- and
you recrystallize it,

00:46:15.367 --> 00:46:18.349
to make sure it's pure,
that salt you got out.

00:46:18.349 --> 00:46:20.750
The melting point didn't
change, it was already pure.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:25.186
Liberate the acid by shaking it
with hydrochloric acid and

00:46:25.186 --> 00:46:25.809
ether.
 

00:46:25.809 --> 00:46:30.726
Now you've got the acid;
and it melted 145 to 146,

00:46:30.726 --> 00:46:35.000
and its rotation was
+29.5°.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.650
And it recrystallized and
didn't change it.

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:38.489
It was pure.
 

00:46:38.489 --> 00:46:43.980
And it turns out that the other
one melts 144 to 146°.

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:46.543
And so it's the same melting
point essentially,

00:46:46.543 --> 00:46:48.550
but exactly the opposite
rotation.

00:46:48.550 --> 00:46:51.655
So they manage the separation
by making salts that were

00:46:51.655 --> 00:46:55.166
diastereomeric -- so they had
different solubility -- and then

00:46:55.166 --> 00:46:56.949
take the salts apart again.
 

00:46:56.949 --> 00:47:01.880
And Pasteur figured a way of
doing this, in this story,

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:05.349
which I suspect is not a true
story.

00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:06.840
Now I'm going to stop here.
 

00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:10.347
But we're going to have --
mostly what's on Wednesday's

00:47:10.347 --> 00:47:13.010
lecture is not going to be on
the exam.

00:47:13.010 --> 00:47:16.172
But there's a little more here
that I'm probably going to make

00:47:16.172 --> 00:47:18.329
available for the exam;
that I'll talk about on

00:47:18.329 --> 00:47:18.739
Wednesday.
 

00:47:18.739 --> 00:47:21.532
And I'll have to think over
just how much more it's going to

00:47:21.532 --> 00:47:21.769
be.
 

00:47:21.769 --> 00:47:23.059
Not too much more probably.
 

00:47:23.059 --> 00:47:24.150
Okay?
 

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.389
So we'll see you on Wednesday.
 

00:47:26.389 --> 00:47:28.510
Most of what's on Wednesday
won't be on the exam.

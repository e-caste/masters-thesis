00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.810
Prof: Well I would like
to get started.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:04.280
Good morning.
 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.785
In the discussion section I
realized I sort of screwed my

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:11.260
last lecture.
 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.420
It didn't come quite clearly
through;

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.270
either Hegel or Marx's theory
of alienation.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:27.388
So I would like to come back to
the theory of alienation and how

00:00:27.388 --> 00:00:34.090
Marx gets to The Paris
Manuscripts,

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.980
before we get into historical
materialism.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.853
And let me just make two
introductory comments about

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:44.660
this.
 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:53.570
One important point I tried to
make is you have to be--

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.992
I think one purpose of my
lectures in Marx is to alert you

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:01.344
that there were two Marx's,
not just one,

00:01:01.344 --> 00:01:04.969
and you are likely to know only
about one Marx.

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:05.680
Right?
 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.831
This is Marx,
who had the theory of class

00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:13.167
struggle and the theory of
exploitation--right?--and who

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:15.688
was a theorist of Communism.
 

00:01:15.688 --> 00:01:20.531
But you may know very little
about Marx, the idealist,

00:01:20.531 --> 00:01:22.908
the Hegelian,
the humanist,

00:01:22.908 --> 00:01:27.203
whose central idea was the
notion of alienation.

00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:28.299
Right?
 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.906
Whose major concern was about
the human conditions under

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:36.090
modernity and wanted to overcome
it.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.998
And, you know,
these two very different Marx's

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.390
appeal to very different
audiences.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.660
In fact, the first Marx--the
humanist,

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.864
the Hegelian,
the idealist--was almost

00:01:48.864 --> 00:01:54.805
forgotten for a very long time,
and was rediscovered by the

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:58.250
1960s onwards,
generally.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.506
So it's very important to see
that most likely that what you

00:02:02.506 --> 00:02:06.126
heard about Marx--
and I suppose most of you have

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:10.090
never read any text from Marx--
is a biased view.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.979
You only know one Marx and not
both.

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:18.211
And my point is to try to
introduce you to the complexity,

00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:20.872
that you meet both Karl Marx.
 

00:02:20.872 --> 00:02:21.699
Right?
 

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:27.662
The second point is that--what
I found frustrating in the

00:02:27.662 --> 00:02:32.835
discussion section yesterday,
which was one of the worst I

00:02:32.835 --> 00:02:34.979
did in the last couple of
years--

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.169
not ever in my life I did even
worse discussion sections,

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.310
but this was real bad--that,
you know,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.353
the importance and the
significance of Marx's theory of

00:02:44.353 --> 00:02:46.270
alienation did not come through.
 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.750
And I obviously did a very bad
job,

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.842
because there are very few
texts, written in the

00:02:51.842 --> 00:02:53.654
seventeenth,
eighteenth and nineteenth

00:02:53.654 --> 00:02:56.530
centuries,
which are so powerful and so

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.789
influential,
and so broadly influential,

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.710
on theories of the twentieth
century,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.530
than exactly this text on
alienation.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.694
You can think about
literature--right?--and you can

00:03:09.694 --> 00:03:14.360
see the extraordinary impact of
the idea of alienation in

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.610
literature.
 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.211
Some of you may have read
Albert Camus,

00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:23.288
the French novelist--The
Stranger.

00:03:23.288 --> 00:03:27.128
This is right out of the theory
of alienation.

00:03:27.128 --> 00:03:31.370
You may be familiar with Franz
Kafka, right?

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.810
There you go.
 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.889
That's the sense of alienation.
 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:40.604
You may have watched ever the
play, wonderful play,

00:03:40.604 --> 00:03:44.000
of Henrik Ibsen,
Peer Gynt.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.038
That's about alienation. Right?
 

00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:51.328
So in the twentieth century
literature, we are full with the

00:03:51.328 --> 00:03:53.000
senses of alienation.
 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.470
And so is twentieth century
social theory.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.063
There is no twentieth century
social theory without the theory

00:04:01.063 --> 00:04:02.270
of alienation.
 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.566
By the way, it's interesting,
because The Paris

00:04:05.566 --> 00:04:07.854
Manuscript,
for the first time,

00:04:07.854 --> 00:04:09.938
was published only in 1931.
 

00:04:09.938 --> 00:04:13.459
Nevertheless,
the idea was already beginning

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.258
to creep in earlier.
 

00:04:15.258 --> 00:04:20.259
Smart people read the theory of
alienation in Marx earlier;

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.310
Georg LukÃ¡cs,
for instance.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.278
And then the Frankfurt School.
 

00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:27.497
There is no Adorno,
there is no Horkheimer,

00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:30.639
there is no Marcuse,
without the theory of

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.790
alienation.
 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.190
And I can go even further.
 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.321
There is no cultural theory
without the theory of

00:04:37.321 --> 00:04:38.170
alienation.
 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.213
There is no Bauman,
there is no Kolakowski,

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:43.750
without the theory of
alienation.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.440
This is a very important idea.
 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.420
So I have to come back to this
and to try to show you how he

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.896
arrives at this point,
and why he abandons it--why the

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:58.259
second Marx is emerging.
 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.160
And then we get,
starting with the second Marx,

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.009
the first step towards the
second Marx is the "Theses

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:09.129
on Feuerbach," what
I want to talk about today.

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:11.973
And I'll try to economize with
my time, right?

00:05:11.973 --> 00:05:12.480
Right?
 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.641
I have to learn from Adam
Smith--right?--to be more

00:05:16.641 --> 00:05:21.303
utilitarian and to make sure
that means and ends do match

00:05:21.303 --> 00:05:22.970
with each other.
 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.913
Okay, let's come back to Hegel
and Hegel's theory of

00:05:26.913 --> 00:05:27.920
alienation.
 

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.050
Because I don't think--from the
discussion section my sense was

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.850
I did not make it clear enough,
what Hegel's theory is.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.190
And well let me try to labor on
this.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.370
As I said, you know,
he was an idealist,

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.100
and I hope I explained it to
the extent it is necessary.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.218
I will come back to this when I
will be talking about the

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:56.839
"Theses on Feuerbach"
and The German Ideology.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:06:01.992
But he really thought that
somehow consciousness precedes

00:06:01.992 --> 00:06:06.408
material existence,
and that's what made him into

00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:07.879
an idealist.
 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:11.670
How religious he was I actually
don't know.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.326
This is not a religious,
not a theological proposition.

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:14.720
Right?
 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.944
The idea is that before the
physical world existed,

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:21.733
there has been an absolute
spirit.

00:06:21.733 --> 00:06:22.579
Right?
 

00:06:22.579 --> 00:06:27.038
At the origin of the world,
there is an absolute spirit

00:06:27.038 --> 00:06:31.829
existing, and that exists in the
material world as such.

00:06:31.829 --> 00:06:37.754
And then his central idea is
that you can describe the

00:06:37.754 --> 00:06:43.790
history of the universe as a
problem of alienation,

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:47.019
as a problem of gradual
separation,

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:50.899
as I said, from subject and
object.

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:55.252
This is a very important idea,
and we will have to deal with

00:06:55.252 --> 00:06:56.360
this in Marx.
 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.427
And even if you are dealing
with twentieth century theories,

00:07:01.427 --> 00:07:05.204
critical theory,
this is a central notion of,

00:07:05.204 --> 00:07:08.040
you know, subject and object.
 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.660
Let me try to labor on this a
minute.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.750
And I have to do it on the
blackboard.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:22.752
So Hegel's fundamental idea is
that when you have the absolute

00:07:22.752 --> 00:07:32.264
spirit--right?--and this is not
a personal God but just the

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:33.740
idea.
 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.629
Here this is a situation of
totality.

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:44.271
The absolute spirit is at the
same time subject and object,

00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:46.218
united in itself.
 

00:07:46.218 --> 00:07:47.250
Right?
 

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.019
And that's what Hegel calls
totality.

00:07:50.019 --> 00:07:54.776
And there's the term totality
being used later on in critical

00:07:54.776 --> 00:07:55.490
theory.
 

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:58.884
And we are saying we are
searching for totality,

00:07:58.884 --> 00:08:02.860
we are searching for the unity
of subject and object.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.925
Well in Hegel's,
the second stage is that

00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:09.680
subject and object are divided
from each other.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:16.750
&lt;&lt;Professor writes on
blackboard&gt;&gt;

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:22.120
There is the material world
without consciousness,

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.019
and consciousness becomes
absolute consciousness because

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:29.920
it's kind of projected the
material world out of itself.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.629
Right?
 

00:08:30.629 --> 00:08:34.700
And this is the--this is the
situation of alienation.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:43.970
Object becomes separate.
 

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:48.865
Then, as human beings emerge,
subject and object beginning to

00:08:48.865 --> 00:08:49.355
merge.
 

00:08:49.355 --> 00:08:50.090
Right?
 

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.570
Consciousness emerges. Right?
 

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.200
Consciousness--right?
 

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.375
These are subject--this is
you--and object are the

00:09:00.375 --> 00:09:02.422
conditions of your life.
 

00:09:02.422 --> 00:09:03.190
Right?
 

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.657
Another person you are
interacting with is an object of

00:09:07.657 --> 00:09:09.230
your interaction.
 

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.904
Or the conditions of your life.
 

00:09:11.904 --> 00:09:12.509
Right?
 

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:13.970
The objective conditions.
 

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.038
This room.
 

00:09:15.038 --> 00:09:18.203
At Yale University the
construction which is going out

00:09:18.203 --> 00:09:20.711
there--right?--is our objective
conditions.

00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:21.308
Right?
 

00:09:21.308 --> 00:09:24.509
And you are the subject who are
reflecting on it.

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:28.274
But because you are gaining
some consciousness,

00:09:28.274 --> 00:09:33.182
you are beginning to conquer
the objective conditions of your

00:09:33.182 --> 00:09:33.918
life.
 

00:09:33.918 --> 00:09:38.187
And what he's suggesting,
that alienation will overcome

00:09:38.187 --> 00:09:42.453
when your subject will be able
to control the objective

00:09:42.453 --> 00:09:44.350
conditions of your life.
 

00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:45.220
Right?
 

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.784
Where your consciousness is
adequate to your existence.

00:09:50.784 --> 00:09:51.610
Right?
 

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:55.433
When you are the master of your
life, you are a master of your

00:09:55.433 --> 00:09:56.250
conditions.
 

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.951
It is not the conditions which
rule you, but you are the master

00:10:00.951 --> 00:10:02.317
of the conditions.
 

00:10:02.317 --> 00:10:03.000
Right?
 

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.269
That is the key idea in Hegel.
 

00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:11.690
And Marx is very much following
this idea.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.820
I mean, he of course eliminates
the whole idea of absolute

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:16.326
spirit.
 

00:10:16.326 --> 00:10:16.980
Right?
 

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:22.440
He doesn't want to deal with
the idea of absolute spirit.

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.710
For him this is too speculative.
 

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:29.173
He's also bothered by the idea
that you can overcome the

00:10:29.173 --> 00:10:32.337
problem of alienation simply by
thought.

00:10:32.337 --> 00:10:33.149
Right?
 

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:39.755
Marx's project is to bring this
whole idea of alienation down to

00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:42.635
earth,
to everyday experience,

00:10:42.635 --> 00:10:46.340
to your experience and your
experience of,

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.840
I would use the term,
modernity, until 1944.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:56.849
Marx does not have a concept of
capitalism or capitalist mode of

00:10:56.849 --> 00:10:57.724
production.
 

00:10:57.724 --> 00:10:58.440
Right?
 

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.778
He even just vaguely thinks
about private ownership.

00:11:01.778 --> 00:11:06.129
He's really trying to
conceptualize modernity,

00:11:06.129 --> 00:11:11.407
modern industrial urban life,
as distinct from earlier

00:11:11.407 --> 00:11:15.224
communal life--
the life what we had in more

00:11:15.224 --> 00:11:19.062
intimate communities,
peasants of the villages or

00:11:19.062 --> 00:11:19.759
whatever.
 

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:20.379
Right?
 

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:22.250
He tries to conceptualize this.
 

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:25.940
He sees this as a progress,
modernity as a progress.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.413
But we have to pay a heavy
price for it,

00:11:29.413 --> 00:11:34.849
and the price what we pay for
this modernity is the separation

00:11:34.849 --> 00:11:36.808
of subject and object.
 

00:11:36.808 --> 00:11:37.788
Right?
 

00:11:37.788 --> 00:11:42.096
The peasant in a village was
not separated from the objective

00:11:42.096 --> 00:11:44.250
conditions of his existence.
 

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.529
It was united with the
objective conditions.

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:49.893
It was bound to the earth.
 

00:11:49.893 --> 00:11:50.529
Right?
 

00:11:50.529 --> 00:11:54.534
Even the slaves were not
separated from the objective

00:11:54.534 --> 00:11:57.000
conditions of their existence.
 

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.013
They were treated as objects.
 

00:11:59.013 --> 00:11:59.500
Right?
 

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.408
There was no subject separated
from the object.

00:12:02.408 --> 00:12:07.000
So the unique--this is Marx,
this is not Hegel anymore--

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.114
the unique feature of
alienation, that you have this

00:12:11.114 --> 00:12:14.179
separation from subject and
object,

00:12:14.179 --> 00:12:16.620
in modern conditions. Right?
 

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:22.285
And I think this is why Marx's
theory of alienation survived

00:12:22.285 --> 00:12:25.360
Marx's theory of exploitation.
 

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.230
That the young Marx survived
the old Marx;

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.639
the first Marx survived the
second Marx.

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:37.990
Because we can all relate more
if you have a good lecturer,

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:43.710
and who brings more effectively
to you what he's getting at.

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:46.678
You can relate more,
you can say much more,

00:12:46.678 --> 00:12:49.364
"Oh yeah,
I feel alienated in this

00:12:49.364 --> 00:12:50.990
class." Right?
 

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:53.389
"That makes no sense to
me." Right?

00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:56.320
"This doesn't make any
sense to my life,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.408
and I have to sit there because
I'm a sociology major and I have

00:12:59.408 --> 00:13:00.977
to take this bloody class."
 

00:13:00.977 --> 00:13:01.419
Right?
 

00:13:01.419 --> 00:13:03.490
Then you are alienated. Right?
 

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.500
And this is when you
will--that's what you will say.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.129
Right?
 

00:13:08.129 --> 00:13:12.562
"I am alienated because I
have to do this nonsense because

00:13:12.562 --> 00:13:14.779
they force me to do so."
 

00:13:14.779 --> 00:13:16.250
Then you are alienated.
 

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.822
This is exactly what Marx is
getting at.

00:13:18.822 --> 00:13:19.350
Right?
 

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.280
Well in a way it is your
choice.

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.778
Right?
 

00:13:21.778 --> 00:13:23.917
You declared a sociology major.
 

00:13:23.917 --> 00:13:24.399
Right?
 

00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:27.908
But then you are forced to do
stuff what you don't really want

00:13:27.908 --> 00:13:28.370
to do.
 

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:30.830
So it doesn't mean that you are
not free.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:33.518
You are free,
but within your freedom you are

00:13:33.518 --> 00:13:36.879
alienated because you don't
control your conditions,

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:39.850
and it looks like that within
your freedom,

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.004
within your free choice,
you are forced to do stuff.

00:13:43.004 --> 00:13:43.500
Right?
 

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.918
This is what Marx is trying to
get at.

00:13:46.918 --> 00:13:50.220
You think you are free,
you think you are equal with

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.678
others, and you are really not
free.

00:13:52.678 --> 00:13:56.591
Because the objective
conditions, what you created for

00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:57.919
yourself--right?
 

00:13:57.919 --> 00:13:59.990
You got into trouble. Right?
 

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:02.799
Who forced you to be a
sociology major?

00:14:02.799 --> 00:14:04.158
Nobody.
 

00:14:04.158 --> 00:14:07.230
And then you are in the trouble
that you have to do-- take

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:08.200
certain hurdles.
 

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.535
But you feel alienated and you
don't feel that your whole

00:14:11.535 --> 00:14:13.383
personality is being developed.
 

00:14:13.383 --> 00:14:13.918
Right?
 

00:14:13.918 --> 00:14:17.280
To put it with John Stuart
Mill, you don't feel

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.668
self-development.
 

00:14:18.668 --> 00:14:21.970
Then you are alienated,
unduly so.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:22.769
Right?
 

00:14:22.769 --> 00:14:25.919
Is that a bit coming closer to
it?

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:27.820
Makes more sense?
 

00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.678
All right.
 

00:14:29.678 --> 00:14:34.029
Now let me therefore also show
you how Marx gets to it.

00:14:34.029 --> 00:14:35.330
I think this is very important.
 

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:40.109
And I skipped all of this stuff
because I was trying to get very

00:14:40.109 --> 00:14:44.282
quickly--I was trying to get too
quickly--to the notion,

00:14:44.282 --> 00:14:46.710
Marx's theory of alienation.
 

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.610
And now I would like to correct
this.

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:55.174
And I already foreshadowed in
my last lecture that these are

00:14:55.174 --> 00:14:59.960
formidable years for Marx,
1843 and 1844.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.844
In two years his intellectual
development is quite

00:15:04.844 --> 00:15:06.440
extraordinary.
 

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:10.970
Let me follow you through of
these intellectual developments.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:15.386
In the summer of 1843,
he writes this book,

00:15:15.386 --> 00:15:22.120
Contributions to a Critique
of Hegel's Philosophy of Right;

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.808
or Hegel's Philosophy of
Law.

00:15:23.808 --> 00:15:37.629
Well Hegel has gone through a
long development intellectually.

00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:41.254
He started out as a radical,
an admirer of the French

00:15:41.254 --> 00:15:44.408
Revolution,
and as he was getting older he

00:15:44.408 --> 00:15:48.400
was becoming more and more
conservative and was becoming

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:52.830
concerned about the consequences
of the French Revolution.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:59.678
And as he became,
you know, more conservative,

00:15:59.678 --> 00:16:02.267
he was--he said,
"Well what is happening

00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:05.972
with the French after the French
Revolution is not really what I

00:16:05.972 --> 00:16:06.620
wanted.
 

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:11.960
Because now the French
Revolution is actually splitting

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:17.298
the society in two classes,
capital and labor."

00:16:17.298 --> 00:16:19.493
It's not exactly the
terminology what he means,

00:16:19.493 --> 00:16:21.780
but that's what Hegel is
getting at in The

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.259
Philosophy of Right.
 

00:16:23.259 --> 00:16:26.470
"And who can tell who is
right and who is wrong?

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.918
They are in conflict with each
other.

00:16:28.918 --> 00:16:32.509
The employers or the owners
want something,

00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:35.759
and the workers want something
else.

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:41.308
They both represent
particularistic interests.

00:16:41.308 --> 00:16:44.320
But where is the universalistic
interests?"

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.980
So asked Hegel.
 

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:48.769
There must be some universal
justice.

00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:53.062
To put it in the terminology we
used in this course before,

00:16:53.062 --> 00:16:56.985
there must be something like
common good, which brings

00:16:56.985 --> 00:16:59.279
capital and labor together.
 

00:16:59.279 --> 00:17:02.470
Where will this common good
come from?

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.565
And in The Philosophy of
Right he offers an

00:17:06.565 --> 00:17:08.318
interesting theory.
 

00:17:08.318 --> 00:17:13.301
He said it will come from the
government, it comes from the

00:17:13.301 --> 00:17:13.990
state.
 

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:17.789
The state should represent the
universal instance.

00:17:17.789 --> 00:17:22.482
And then he said, "Well,
you know, the society,

00:17:22.482 --> 00:17:27.455
modern bourgeois society which
emerged as a result of the

00:17:27.455 --> 00:17:31.286
French Revolution,
is divided into these

00:17:31.286 --> 00:17:33.519
particularistic classes.
 

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:39.038
But we need a universal agent,
a universal class,

00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:43.271
which represents the common
good, and this must be the

00:17:43.271 --> 00:17:47.114
government,
this must be the class of civil

00:17:47.114 --> 00:17:48.519
servants."
 

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:51.519
And in the book,
Philosophy of Right--

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:54.230
which is his kind of last major
book,

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:59.469
writes it not long before he
dies--he argues these are the

00:17:59.469 --> 00:18:04.250
civil servants who constitute
the universal class.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.049
Now this is not a silly idea.
 

00:18:07.049 --> 00:18:09.828
We do think about it this way.
 

00:18:09.828 --> 00:18:13.710
And yes, I mean,
he builds in many respects,

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:18.776
in a more sophisticated way,
on Locke and Rousseau and the

00:18:18.776 --> 00:18:22.858
idea of general will,
particularly in Rousseau. Right?

00:18:22.858 --> 00:18:25.817
And this is the state which
should represent the general

00:18:25.817 --> 00:18:26.086
will.
 

00:18:26.086 --> 00:18:26.568
Right?
 

00:18:26.568 --> 00:18:31.335
And we also occasionally think
about it this way.

00:18:31.335 --> 00:18:32.130
Right?
 

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:36.124
There are all these conflicts
around this country,

00:18:36.124 --> 00:18:41.178
and we expect the government to
express the universal interest,

00:18:41.178 --> 00:18:43.950
to innervate the general will.
 

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:47.847
We expect occasionally the
federal government to do that,

00:18:47.847 --> 00:18:51.328
and the federal government
occasionally does it.

00:18:51.328 --> 00:18:55.019
You have read about the Civil
Rights Movement.

00:18:55.019 --> 00:19:02.167
I mean, who was the agency
which made sure that the states

00:19:02.167 --> 00:19:08.690
actually obey the laws and
integrates the schools?

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:11.194
It was the federal government.
 

00:19:11.194 --> 00:19:11.778
Right?
 

00:19:11.778 --> 00:19:15.626
It was Bobby Kennedy who went
down and made sure that the

00:19:15.626 --> 00:19:18.031
southern states do follow the
rules.

00:19:18.031 --> 00:19:18.720
Right?
 

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:25.046
We expected the government to
express the universal interest.

00:19:25.046 --> 00:19:25.890
Right?
 

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:27.920
So it's not silly.
 

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.363
But Marx, in a way,
said, "Well,

00:19:30.363 --> 00:19:32.058
that's not that simple.
 

00:19:32.058 --> 00:19:36.910
Hegel is naÃ¯ve about the
government."

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.387
And he said,
"Well the government is

00:19:40.387 --> 00:19:44.910
not that non-partial as we would
like it to be."

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:45.779
Right?
 

00:19:45.779 --> 00:19:51.280
If you are rich,
you have more influence on what

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:56.548
the government does,
rather when you are poor.

00:19:56.548 --> 00:19:57.720
Right?
 

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:03.123
There are lobbyists in
Washington DC,

00:20:03.123 --> 00:20:10.627
and you probably have very
little leverage on these

00:20:10.627 --> 00:20:12.730
lobbyists.
 

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:17.916
Big business has a lot of
leverage on these lobbyists.

00:20:17.916 --> 00:20:18.700
Right?
 

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.288
And they, of course,
have a great deal of pressure

00:20:22.288 --> 00:20:24.778
on what the legislature will do.
 

00:20:24.778 --> 00:20:31.009
Just follow what is happening
with the healthcare legislation.

00:20:31.009 --> 00:20:35.579
Well you can call your
congressman and you can send

00:20:35.579 --> 00:20:39.053
emails, you know,
and can send letters,

00:20:39.053 --> 00:20:42.068
and ask them to do something.
 

00:20:42.068 --> 00:20:44.911
But believe me,
when the pharmaceutical

00:20:44.911 --> 00:20:48.950
industry spends a lot of money
and tells a senator,

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:51.858
you know, "Unless you vote
this way or that way,

00:20:51.858 --> 00:20:56.259
we probably may not be able to
support your next electoral

00:20:56.259 --> 00:20:59.816
campaign"--
right?--then it will make more

00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:02.200
impact than your individual
email.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:02.848
Right?
 

00:21:02.848 --> 00:21:06.490
Not that you should not send
individual emails.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.859
Send it. Right?
 

00:21:07.859 --> 00:21:08.500
Be involved.
 

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.715
But be aware that the
government is sent to be more

00:21:12.715 --> 00:21:15.328
responsible for big business.
 

00:21:15.328 --> 00:21:17.106
"So",
he said, "How can it be

00:21:17.106 --> 00:21:18.098
universal class?"
 

00:21:18.098 --> 00:21:22.686
That's really the point what
he's making in The Philosophy

00:21:22.686 --> 00:21:23.681
of Right.
 

00:21:23.681 --> 00:21:24.369
Right?
 

00:21:24.369 --> 00:21:26.559
The state is not universal.
 

00:21:26.559 --> 00:21:29.150
It pretends to be universal.
 

00:21:29.150 --> 00:21:32.214
It has to pretend to be
universal in order to be

00:21:32.214 --> 00:21:35.150
legitimate, but really it is not
universal.

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.319
And the civil servants are,
of course, not a universal

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:39.950
class.
 

00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.244
Occasionally they are quite
corrupt.

00:21:42.244 --> 00:21:42.769
Right?
 

00:21:42.769 --> 00:21:45.450
Not in the United States,
of course, but in some

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.358
countries I can think of civil
servants are corrupt.

00:21:48.358 --> 00:21:48.930
Right?
 

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.432
You know, and then they are
offered, you know,

00:21:52.432 --> 00:21:55.470
a free seat,
you know, on a private jet,

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:56.950
they accept it.
 

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.210
And then they accepted it,
they do something for the owner

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.355
of that private jet.
 

00:22:01.355 --> 00:22:01.868
Right?
 

00:22:01.868 --> 00:22:05.424
So there are some civil
servants who are not all that

00:22:05.424 --> 00:22:08.640
innocent--right?--and they can
be influenced.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:11.338
So it is not all that universal
class.

00:22:11.338 --> 00:22:15.538
They are--not all civil
servants are angels.

00:22:15.538 --> 00:22:16.318
Right?
 

00:22:16.318 --> 00:22:20.019
Some of them are,
some of them are not.

00:22:20.019 --> 00:22:23.535
In fact, he concludes the
unfinished book,

00:22:23.535 --> 00:22:28.680
"that really the problem
is that we don't have universal

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.880
suffrage";
writes he in 1843.

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.593
And he said,
"Let's have universal

00:22:35.593 --> 00:22:38.230
suffrage,
and then if we in free

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.279
elections universally elect the
representatives,

00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:43.890
the problem will be gone."
 

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:47.265
As we know, he was not quite
right.

00:22:47.265 --> 00:22:48.058
Right?
 

00:22:48.058 --> 00:22:53.232
We have all equal vote but we
do not have all equal voice.

00:22:53.232 --> 00:22:53.960
Right?
 

00:22:53.960 --> 00:23:01.118
I think that's--but Marx here
is still a bourgeois liberal;

00:23:01.118 --> 00:23:06.540
as of the summer of 1843
believes the problem will be

00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:07.480
solved.
 

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.963
Now let me rush through and
show you the kind of

00:23:10.963 --> 00:23:15.558
intellectual development--and I
briefly pointed out to this.

00:23:15.558 --> 00:23:20.259
These are the three important
steps which follows this

00:23:20.259 --> 00:23:22.298
abandoned manuscript.
 

00:23:22.298 --> 00:23:25.984
He now enters the road of
radicalization,

00:23:25.984 --> 00:23:30.776
moves away from Hegel,
and tries to carve out his own

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:34.368
intellectual and political
project.

00:23:34.368 --> 00:23:37.827
And he writes the paper
"On the Jewish

00:23:37.827 --> 00:23:40.380
Question"
in which he says,

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.849
"Well Hegel is right.
 

00:23:42.849 --> 00:23:45.009
We need something universal.
 

00:23:45.009 --> 00:23:49.092
We should not allow society
just to be the struggle of

00:23:49.092 --> 00:23:51.556
particularistic interests."
 

00:23:51.556 --> 00:23:52.250
Right?
 

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:57.118
This is in a way against Adam
Smith's utilitarianism.

00:23:57.118 --> 00:24:00.424
It's not enough that
individuals fight each others'

00:24:00.424 --> 00:24:03.002
interests out,
and that will end up to a

00:24:03.002 --> 00:24:04.259
universal good.
 

00:24:04.259 --> 00:24:08.924
We need some universal good to
be achieved, and it will not

00:24:08.924 --> 00:24:12.384
simply achieved by
particularistic interests

00:24:12.384 --> 00:24:13.430
followed.
 

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.980
That is Marx's point.
 

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.123
But then he writes an
introduction to the

00:24:19.123 --> 00:24:22.973
Critique--
Contributions to the Critique

00:24:22.973 --> 00:24:26.038
of Hegel's Philosophy of
Right.

00:24:26.038 --> 00:24:28.796
And in this introduction he
said, "Well,

00:24:28.796 --> 00:24:31.990
we need something;
universal emancipation.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:36.269
But who will bring universal
emancipation to humankind?"

00:24:36.269 --> 00:24:36.838
Right?
 

00:24:36.838 --> 00:24:40.730
He's looking for an agent who
can carry this out.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:44.050
And in the introduction,
he said, "This will be the

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.259
proletariat."
 

00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:49.538
Well you may say now he's
entering the wrong road--

00:24:49.538 --> 00:24:54.130
right?--and he's entering a
very--he's basically painting

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.561
himself in the corner,
where he will be for the rest

00:24:57.561 --> 00:25:00.212
of his life,
trying to show that indeed the

00:25:00.212 --> 00:25:02.660
proletariat will emancipate us
all,

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:05.618
and will create a good society
as such.

00:25:05.618 --> 00:25:08.858
But people, when they are
reading the introduction--and I

00:25:08.858 --> 00:25:12.387
will give you a few citations
from it because it's a beautiful

00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:13.430
piece of work.
 

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.900
In many ways it is wonderful
poetry.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.078
He has some extraordinary
framing of the problem.

00:25:21.078 --> 00:25:23.348
But then, you know,
his critics said,

00:25:23.348 --> 00:25:25.240
"What a nonsense."
 

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.160
You know?
 

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.058
"Why on earth the
proletariat?

00:25:29.058 --> 00:25:31.880
As we all know,
the workers are dumb.

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:36.635
I mean, you are saying that we,
the critical philosophers,

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:39.390
we cannot emancipate humankind?
 

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:43.166
But you think that these
ordinary workers,

00:25:43.166 --> 00:25:47.772
with alienated consciousness,
they will bring us an

00:25:47.772 --> 00:25:49.799
unalienated world?
 

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:51.099
How comes?
 

00:25:51.099 --> 00:25:52.700
What nonsense is this?"
 

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.200
So that's when he writes The
Paris Manuscripts,

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:59.459
and tries to now bring the
whole idea of alienation down to

00:25:59.459 --> 00:26:03.347
earth,
to fill it with some economic

00:26:03.347 --> 00:26:04.348
content.
 

00:26:04.348 --> 00:26:07.679
That's why now he tries to
relate it to commodity

00:26:07.679 --> 00:26:11.032
production,
and make the claim that though

00:26:11.032 --> 00:26:14.368
in modern society everybody's
alienated,

00:26:14.368 --> 00:26:18.730
but they are only the workers
who are fully alienated,

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.868
and their interest is to
overcome the alienation.

00:26:21.868 --> 00:26:26.450
That's what--this is why he
tries to argue that alienation

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:30.869
will bring the working class to
emancipate humankind;

00:26:30.869 --> 00:26:33.108
that is the project.
 

00:26:33.108 --> 00:26:36.490
Of course, he never publishes
the book,

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:39.490
because after he wrote it down,
he said,

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.700
"Well"-- I suppose he
said, "Well,

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.430
this is quite nicely written.
 

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:45.029
I have a couple of good ideas.
 

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:47.818
But nobody will believe
me." Right?

00:26:47.818 --> 00:26:51.126
"The working class will
not go on the barricades and die

00:26:51.126 --> 00:26:54.157
because I am telling them that
they are alienated."

00:26:54.157 --> 00:26:54.710
Right?
 

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.098
"They don't care about
alienation.

00:26:58.098 --> 00:27:00.996
I have to come up some-- some
better reason,

00:27:00.996 --> 00:27:04.500
you know, why the working class
will revolt."

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.920
And that's the end of the young
Marx.

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:11.055
And now he's beginning to read
Adam Smith and Ricardo and

00:27:11.055 --> 00:27:12.384
political economy.
 

00:27:12.384 --> 00:27:13.048
Right?
 

00:27:13.048 --> 00:27:16.920
And he's beginning to develop
his theory of exploitation.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.415
This is the young or mature
Marx, and we will talk about him

00:27:21.415 --> 00:27:22.558
very briefly.
 

00:27:22.558 --> 00:27:26.493
Now just a couple of ideas
here.

00:27:26.493 --> 00:27:27.509
Right?
 

00:27:27.509 --> 00:27:29.878
What about "On the Jewish
Question",

00:27:29.878 --> 00:27:30.880
what is at stake?
 

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:35.759
Bruno Bauer wrote a paper on
the origins of anti-Semitism,

00:27:35.759 --> 00:27:39.203
and he said,
"We have anti-Semitism in

00:27:39.203 --> 00:27:42.650
Germany because the state is
Christian,

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.068
and as long as the state is
Christian it will discriminate

00:27:46.068 --> 00:27:47.210
against the Jews.
 

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:50.978
So the solution is to separate
the state and the church,

00:27:50.978 --> 00:27:53.103
to have political emancipation.
 

00:27:53.103 --> 00:27:53.720
Right?
 

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.595
And if we have political
emancipation,

00:27:56.595 --> 00:27:59.160
we abolish anti-Semitism."
 

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.859
Now Marx takes his point here
and he said, "Look,

00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:06.608
this guy is completely wrong.
 

00:28:06.608 --> 00:28:10.527
Look at the United States,
the church and the state are

00:28:10.527 --> 00:28:13.202
separated,
and in the nineteenth century

00:28:13.202 --> 00:28:16.252
there was quite a bit of
anti-Semitism in the United

00:28:16.252 --> 00:28:17.210
States."
 

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.200
Not only in the nineteenth
century.

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:24.830
In this very institution,
in the 1920s and '30s,

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:28.278
there was a lot of
anti-Semitism.

00:28:28.278 --> 00:28:31.970
There's a wonderful
sociologist, Jeremy Karabel,

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:36.856
who wrote a great book about
admission policies of Ivy League

00:28:36.856 --> 00:28:41.607
universities in the 1920s,
and he was able to prove that

00:28:41.607 --> 00:28:45.092
Ivy League universities,
including Yale,

00:28:45.092 --> 00:28:47.420
actually applied a quota.
 

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:52.244
They never admitted more Jews
to Yale than the average Jewish

00:28:52.244 --> 00:28:54.980
population in the United States.
 

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.298
Believe it or not.
 

00:28:57.298 --> 00:29:00.980
It was never official policy
but it was practiced all the

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:01.440
time.
 

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.848
So, I mean, there was
anti-Semitism.

00:29:04.848 --> 00:29:09.634
Anti-Semitism can exist if the
state and church are separated,

00:29:09.634 --> 00:29:12.848
if the state is supposed to be
secular.

00:29:12.848 --> 00:29:17.212
And Marx said,
"Where does come like

00:29:17.212 --> 00:29:19.940
racism come from?"
 

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.397
He said it comes from,
what he said,

00:29:23.397 --> 00:29:24.980
civil society.
 

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.720
He doesn't have the notion of
capitalism.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:32.096
He said this is rooted in
people's everyday experience and

00:29:32.096 --> 00:29:32.788
interest.
 

00:29:32.788 --> 00:29:33.480
Right?
 

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:39.215
Anti-Semitism comes from civil
society because some people feel

00:29:39.215 --> 00:29:41.529
threatened by the Jews.
 

00:29:41.529 --> 00:29:46.258
Why is there,
you know, anti-African American

00:29:46.258 --> 00:29:47.440
feelings?
 

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.296
Because some people feel
threatened by African Americans.

00:29:52.296 --> 00:29:52.990
Right?
 

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.308
And this is why there is racism.
 

00:29:56.308 --> 00:30:00.150
So you have to fix the problems
in civil society.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:04.348
The problem is in civil
society, not in the state.

00:30:04.348 --> 00:30:09.088
Therefore what you need is
universal emancipation.

00:30:09.088 --> 00:30:11.672
That's the bottom line of
"On the Jewish

00:30:11.672 --> 00:30:12.670
Question."
 

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.609
Is that reasonably clear?
 

00:30:15.609 --> 00:30:19.299
Okay, then let's go further.
 

00:30:19.299 --> 00:30:22.480
And this is the Introduction.
 

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:29.390
Well there are some wonderful
stuff in this.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:34.380
It's more poetry than--it is
certainly not social science.

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:37.730
I would say more poetry,
but very forcefully done.

00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:42.538
Well he said,
"What we have to do is to

00:30:42.538 --> 00:30:48.468
move beyond Feuerbach,
who simply sort of contemplated

00:30:48.468 --> 00:30:51.598
on the situations."
 

00:30:51.598 --> 00:30:54.894
And he said,
"Once the holy form of

00:30:54.894 --> 00:30:59.877
human self-estrangement has been
unmasked"--that's what

00:30:59.877 --> 00:31:01.059
Feuerbach did.
 

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:01.990
Right?
 

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:07.894
He did show that alienation is
our--we're projecting our

00:31:07.894 --> 00:31:10.792
alienation by creating God.
 

00:31:10.792 --> 00:31:11.759
Right?
 

00:31:11.759 --> 00:31:18.067
He said, "Now the task is
to unmask self-estrangement or

00:31:18.067 --> 00:31:22.798
alienation in its unholy
form." Right?

00:31:22.798 --> 00:31:27.000
In the everyday life--in your
everyday experience--especially

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.098
in your economic activities.
 

00:31:29.098 --> 00:31:32.250
That is the point what he tries
to make.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:36.708
Then he goes further and he
says, "Well the Young

00:31:36.708 --> 00:31:39.990
Hegelians said 'Be a critical
critic;

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:42.348
criticize the Hegelian
theory'."

00:31:42.348 --> 00:31:46.220
And I think this is a fantastic
sentence;

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.390
again, it's beautiful poetry.
 

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:53.328
Very dangerous and let a lot of
trouble in history.

00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:56.538
In a way I wish he would not
have written it down.

00:31:56.538 --> 00:32:00.944
But I love that he did write it
down, because it's a beautiful

00:32:00.944 --> 00:32:01.740
sentence.
 

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:06.084
"The weapon of criticism
cannot replace the criticism by

00:32:06.084 --> 00:32:07.097
weapons."
 

00:32:07.097 --> 00:32:07.750
Right?
 

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:13.608
Well it's not enough to be
critical in thought.

00:32:13.608 --> 00:32:16.507
You have to be critical in
action.

00:32:16.507 --> 00:32:17.210
Right?
 

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:18.720
You have to act on it.
 

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:21.609
Just do not just talk.
 

00:32:21.609 --> 00:32:23.660
Do something about it.
 

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.368
That's what it says.
 

00:32:25.368 --> 00:32:28.324
Well I think this is,
you know, one of the strongest

00:32:28.324 --> 00:32:31.220
sentences I have read in social
science literature.

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:31.798
Right?
 

00:32:31.798 --> 00:32:35.596
"The weapon of criticism
cannot replace the criticism by

00:32:35.596 --> 00:32:36.608
weapons."
 

00:32:36.608 --> 00:32:40.338
Well this is also a great
sentence.

00:32:40.338 --> 00:32:46.670
"Theory becomes a material
force as soon as it has grabbed

00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:50.038
the masses--gripped the masses.
 

00:32:50.038 --> 00:32:55.270
Theory is capable of gripping
the masses as soon as it

00:32:55.270 --> 00:32:58.430
demonstrates ad hominem."
 

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:01.240
Woo.
 

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.200
That's quite something. Right?
 

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.630
What he--right?
 

00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:09.118
He said, "Well the
question is what is a good

00:33:09.118 --> 00:33:12.608
theory, what will help you
emancipate yourself?

00:33:12.608 --> 00:33:17.521
Good, the essence of good
theory, that it grabs you,

00:33:17.521 --> 00:33:19.353
it grips you."
 

00:33:19.353 --> 00:33:20.220
Right?
 

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.227
When you say,
"Uh-huh,

00:33:21.227 --> 00:33:22.079
it did hit me."
 

00:33:22.079 --> 00:33:24.690
This is theory. Right?
 

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:30.424
But it can only be when it is
ad hominem, when it addresses

00:33:30.424 --> 00:33:31.808
your problems.
 

00:33:31.808 --> 00:33:32.700
Right?
 

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:36.345
A theory, what you are lost,
you don't know why it is

00:33:36.345 --> 00:33:38.940
relevant for your life,
is no good.

00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:43.804
I would even go as far,
the theory which is boring is

00:33:43.804 --> 00:33:45.019
bad theory.
 

00:33:45.019 --> 00:33:47.890
What you need is fascinating
theory.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:49.579
You have to be fascinated.
 

00:33:49.579 --> 00:33:52.380
You have to be shocked. Right?
 

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.779
You have to say,
"Yes, now I will live

00:33:55.779 --> 00:33:59.910
differently after I--this theory
I understood."

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:00.720
Right?
 

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.630
It has to move you.
 

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:04.000
That's the good theory.
 

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.130
I think that's a wonderful
point, and very powerfully done.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:12.608
And then he said,
"Well, what--well we say

00:34:12.608 --> 00:34:17.599
that the theory has to grab the
masses, but what kind of masses?

00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:19.320
Whom?
 

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.679
Who is our audience?"
 

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:24.619
Well, and he says,
"In order to carry out a

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:27.050
revolutionary change."
 

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:30.376
It's not enough to have a
theory, not enough to have

00:34:30.376 --> 00:34:30.900
ideas.
 

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.934
"You may need",
he said--it's very problematic

00:34:35.934 --> 00:34:39.789
but very crucial to understand
the downside,

00:34:39.789 --> 00:34:42.652
the bad side of
Marxism--"a passive

00:34:42.652 --> 00:34:47.940
element,
a material base." Right?

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:52.434
As you see, no matter how much
Marx glorifies the working

00:34:52.434 --> 00:34:56.286
class, he thinks about them as a
passive element.

00:34:56.286 --> 00:34:57.090
Right?
 

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:59.889
Simply as a material base.
 

00:34:59.889 --> 00:35:03.449
And that is--who is that?
 

00:35:03.449 --> 00:35:04.500
The proletariat.
 

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.179
And why?
 

00:35:06.179 --> 00:35:08.829
"Because it has nothing to
lose but its chains.

00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:12.983
It has a universal character,
and this is why it is a

00:35:12.983 --> 00:35:14.900
universal class."
 

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.773
And, you know,
in 1843, it may have been quite

00:35:19.773 --> 00:35:20.639
right.
 

00:35:20.639 --> 00:35:24.172
The working class probably had
little else to lose but its

00:35:24.172 --> 00:35:24.730
chains.
 

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:29.909
Certainly in 2009 it's usually
not true.

00:35:29.909 --> 00:35:32.851
The working class has much more
to lose than its chains.

00:35:32.851 --> 00:35:33.280
Right?
 

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:37.320
It has probably its own nice
suburban house.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.750
They probably own two cars.
 

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:42.657
They probably even have some
pension fund,

00:35:42.657 --> 00:35:44.360
on the stock exchange.
 

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:48.411
Even ordinary workers check out
what the Dow Jones did

00:35:48.411 --> 00:35:51.699
yesterday, because it affects
the impact.

00:35:51.699 --> 00:35:54.809
But in his times it was
probably true.

00:35:54.809 --> 00:35:56.820
So this is how he gets to the
problem.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:01.280
It is the proletariat which
will be the universal class.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.934
And now you are already
familiar with The Paris

00:36:03.934 --> 00:36:06.590
Manuscript,
and I will not talk about this.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:10.552
That's why he wants to show
that the proletariat is the most

00:36:10.552 --> 00:36:11.360
alienated.
 

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.230
And that makes--follows
logically.

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:16.713
I think it damages,
to some extent,

00:36:16.713 --> 00:36:20.731
the theory of alienation,
because it narrows it too much

00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:21.389
down.
 

00:36:21.389 --> 00:36:24.956
The focus is too much down on
the working class,

00:36:24.956 --> 00:36:28.219
and in a way too much down on
working class,

00:36:28.219 --> 00:36:31.710
working on industrial
production in firms.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:36.110
But really, the message of
alienation is much broader.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:41.590
It tries to convey you some
general experience of modern

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:45.179
life where we do not feel at
home.

00:36:45.179 --> 00:36:53.021
This is the big framing of the
problem in the early twentieth

00:36:53.021 --> 00:36:54.329
century.
 

00:36:54.329 --> 00:37:01.550
Homelessness, the homeless mind;
that we feel homeless in this

00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:04.539
world, searching for a home.
 

00:37:04.539 --> 00:37:06.760
That's the sense of alienation.
 

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.559
That's what Marx tried to
capture here;

00:37:08.559 --> 00:37:11.280
in a way, unfortunately,
mis-specified.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.030
Too much emphasis on workers,
just because he's beginning to

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:18.844
have this political project and
wants to find a revolutionary

00:37:18.844 --> 00:37:19.480
class.
 

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:22.300
And, you know, he abandons it.
 

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:24.119
"This is ridiculous,
you know.

00:37:24.119 --> 00:37:26.440
I have to put my show
together."

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:31.876
And then he does;
beginning to develop what he

00:37:31.876 --> 00:37:35.110
calls historical materialism.
 

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:37.199
So let's get into that one.
 

00:37:37.199 --> 00:37:46.559
And I have ten minutes to do
it, and that's all right.

00:37:46.559 --> 00:37:50.320
If necessary I will come back
to this.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.219
So Marx is developing what he
calls historical materialism.

00:37:55.219 --> 00:37:59.599
And I will suggest it is
making--it is done in two steps.

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:05.038
First, he's emphasizing
dialectics in his criticism of

00:38:05.038 --> 00:38:06.268
Feuerbach.
 

00:38:06.268 --> 00:38:11.786
Feuerbach is a materialist all
right, but he's a mechanical

00:38:11.786 --> 00:38:16.637
materialist, and Marx wants to
bring dynamics in his

00:38:16.637 --> 00:38:18.159
materialism.
 

00:38:18.159 --> 00:38:23.380
And he will argue that this has
to--he historically specified

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.860
material force.
 

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:30.929
And this is what he will do in
The German Ideology.

00:38:30.929 --> 00:38:34.530
But what is dialectical?
 

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:37.159
I don't want to waste time on
this.

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:40.496
I want to get straight into
"The Theses on

00:38:40.496 --> 00:38:43.614
Feuerbach",
which is a very short text,

00:38:43.614 --> 00:38:44.920
but very deep.
 

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.784
So here are the eleven Theses
of Feuerbach,

00:38:48.784 --> 00:38:52.190
on "Theses on
Feuerbach."

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:58.449
He tries to carve out what his
new approach will be.

00:38:58.449 --> 00:39:03.059
And these are the eleven
pieces--very short.

00:39:03.059 --> 00:39:06.699
He said Feuerbach's materialism
was simply reflective.

00:39:06.699 --> 00:39:11.010
It actually meant subject and
object remained separated,

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:15.067
and the subject reflected on
the object outside of the

00:39:15.067 --> 00:39:17.978
subject,
dominating the actions of the

00:39:17.978 --> 00:39:18.619
subject.
 

00:39:18.619 --> 00:39:22.059
But it is assumed that there
are objective conditions

00:39:22.059 --> 00:39:25.829
irrespective from the subject,
and you only reflect on the

00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:27.550
subjective conditions.
 

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:30.416
And he said,
"Well in the new

00:39:30.416 --> 00:39:34.760
materialism truth is a practical
question."

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.159
And I will talk about this in a
minute.

00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:40.364
It means you have to bring,
by human practice,

00:39:40.364 --> 00:39:42.500
subject and object together.
 

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:45.744
You have to change the
objective conditions of your

00:39:45.744 --> 00:39:46.199
life.
 

00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:49.003
That's, you know,
not a passive agent,

00:39:49.003 --> 00:39:50.900
not over-determination.
 

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:54.420
Marx is always read as a
determinist.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:54.909
No.
 

00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:57.686
As I will say,
Marx's philosophy is a

00:39:57.686 --> 00:40:02.478
philosophy of praxis;
praxis, practical activity is a

00:40:02.478 --> 00:40:04.619
key of Marx's theory.
 

00:40:04.619 --> 00:40:07.829
Man- man changes circumstances.
 

00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:09.389
And how?
 

00:40:09.389 --> 00:40:10.889
We will elaborate on this.
 

00:40:10.889 --> 00:40:12.820
But, you know,
we get--you know,

00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:16.057
we were born in certain
conditions, but we can change

00:40:16.057 --> 00:40:16.244
it.
 

00:40:16.244 --> 00:40:16.929
Right?
 

00:40:16.929 --> 00:40:24.570
Then, but in order to change
really the--we can't act alone.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:25.840
We have to cooperate.
 

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.679
That's thesis four.
 

00:40:27.679 --> 00:40:31.697
He said that Hegel,
he thought it can be done in

00:40:31.697 --> 00:40:32.467
thinking.
 

00:40:32.467 --> 00:40:32.980
No.
 

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:38.320
Feuerbach thought we can do it
in contemplation.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.422
Marx said, "No,
it can be only done by social

00:40:42.422 --> 00:40:43.929
practices."
 

00:40:43.929 --> 00:40:44.489
V, VI.
 

00:40:44.489 --> 00:40:49.159
Well old materialism was
looking at the individual.

00:40:49.159 --> 00:40:50.000
Right?
 

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.143
Now I will look at the
collective, social

00:40:53.143 --> 00:40:56.601
relations--relational,
what I'm suggesting is

00:40:56.601 --> 00:40:57.780
relational.
 

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:01.050
Well religion is also a social
product;

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.539
this is a kind of by the way.
 

00:41:02.539 --> 00:41:06.480
Social life is practical,
follows from what we have said.

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:13.199
Well contemplation implies
isolated individuals in society.

00:41:13.199 --> 00:41:17.108
Well we offer a view of
socialized humanity,

00:41:17.108 --> 00:41:22.018
that we all act together and
there's collective action,

00:41:22.018 --> 00:41:24.199
which brings change.
 

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:28.480
And then the most controversial
and most important one.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:33.059
So far the philosophers have
interpreted the world.

00:41:33.059 --> 00:41:36.554
Now the point is to change it.
 

00:41:36.554 --> 00:41:37.369
Right?
 

00:41:37.369 --> 00:41:41.043
Good theory is not just
describes, it gives you a

00:41:41.043 --> 00:41:44.260
prescription what to do about
your life.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:47.119
That's the kind of theory what
we want.

00:41:47.119 --> 00:41:49.099
That's the "Theses on
Feuerbach."

00:41:49.099 --> 00:41:52.500
Just eleven sentences basically.
 

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.239
Great sentences.
 

00:41:54.239 --> 00:41:58.161
Sort of all materialism is
reflective.

00:41:58.161 --> 00:41:59.010
Right?
 

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:05.110
"The chief defect of
Feuerbach is that things",

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:08.909
he said--the German term is
Gegenstand--

00:42:08.909 --> 00:42:14.780
"is reality,
sensuousness"--

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.750
feeling through our senses,
right?--

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:22.489
"is considered only in the
form of the object";

00:42:22.489 --> 00:42:26.760
that we sense the objects
outside of our contemplation.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:31.016
But sensuousness is not
perceived as human action,

00:42:31.016 --> 00:42:31.797
activity.
 

00:42:31.797 --> 00:42:32.579
Right?
 

00:42:32.579 --> 00:42:37.619
We simply feel the stuff but we
don't do anything about that.

00:42:37.619 --> 00:42:40.530
He said, "Sensuous
activity is what I

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:41.809
emphasize."
 

00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:44.949
Well new materialism.
 

00:42:44.949 --> 00:42:48.304
This is, you know,
one of the most important

00:42:48.304 --> 00:42:50.489
sentences Marx wrote down.
 

00:42:50.489 --> 00:42:55.170
"Well the question whether
objective truths can be

00:42:55.170 --> 00:43:00.369
attributed to human thinking is
not a question of theory,

00:43:00.369 --> 00:43:02.969
but it is a practical question.
 

00:43:02.969 --> 00:43:09.884
Man must prove truth that this
worldliness of his thinking in

00:43:09.884 --> 00:43:11.612
practice."
 

00:43:11.612 --> 00:43:12.650
Right?
 

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:17.460
It's not a speculative thing,
whether a question of truth.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:22.460
"The test of the pudding
is in the eating";

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.369
he says elsewhere.
 

00:43:24.369 --> 00:43:31.900
The Italian Marxist
philosopher, Antonio Gramsci,

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:35.110
who died in the prison of
Mussolini,

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:40.880
called Marxism "the
philosophy of praxis."

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.971
That's the essence of Marxism,
that the truth is not the

00:43:45.971 --> 00:43:51.061
subject reflecting on the
object, but the interaction of

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:53.931
the subject between the object.
 

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:54.949
Right?
 

00:43:54.949 --> 00:44:00.878
That the subject changes the
object in order to meet the need

00:44:00.878 --> 00:44:02.559
of the subject.
 

00:44:02.559 --> 00:44:05.918
That's the major point--the
separation of subject and

00:44:05.918 --> 00:44:06.500
object.
 

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.974
The assumption that there are
objective conditions which are

00:44:10.974 --> 00:44:15.373
outside of our possible action,
is what later Marxists will

00:44:15.373 --> 00:44:16.889
call positivism.
 

00:44:16.889 --> 00:44:20.409
Marxism is not positivist.
 

00:44:20.409 --> 00:44:24.875
It believes that we can change
the world, rather than just to

00:44:24.875 --> 00:44:26.139
accept the world.
 

00:44:26.139 --> 00:44:26.809
Right?
 

00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:31.346
Well I don't have to talk--
don't have enough time to talk

00:44:31.346 --> 00:44:32.619
about Gramsci.
 

00:44:32.619 --> 00:44:35.130
Just one word:
in fact he called Marxism as a

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:38.405
philosophy of praxis,
because he was writing his

00:44:38.405 --> 00:44:41.340
major work in the prison of
Mussolini,

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:45.625
and was smuggling this book out
they called The Prison

00:44:45.625 --> 00:44:46.849
Notebooks.
 

00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:50.210
It was smuggled out before he
died.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:52.878
And he knew that,
you know, the prison guards

00:44:52.878 --> 00:44:53.789
will read it.
 

00:44:53.789 --> 00:44:56.780
So he did not want to write
down the term Marxism.

00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:01.173
When he meant Marxism,
he wrote it 'the philosophy of

00:45:01.173 --> 00:45:02.018
praxis'.
 

00:45:02.018 --> 00:45:08.222
And of course the stupid
Fascist guards did not know what

00:45:08.222 --> 00:45:12.099
on earth philosophy of praxis
is.

00:45:12.099 --> 00:45:15.969
So they did not know he was
writing about Marxism.

00:45:15.969 --> 00:45:19.369
But I think he got a very
important point.

00:45:19.369 --> 00:45:22.780
This is indeed an important
feature of Marxism.

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:25.340
Well man changes circumstances.
 

00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:30.250
Well circumstances are changed
by man.

00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.349
And this is again an important
sentence.

00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:36.349
"The educator must himself
be educated."

00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:39.353
And those of you in my
discussion section yesterday,

00:45:39.353 --> 00:45:42.300
this is what you did:
you educated the educator.

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:45.405
I realized I did not get,
you know, the theory of

00:45:45.405 --> 00:45:47.929
alienation through quite
effectively.

00:45:47.929 --> 00:45:51.010
So I went back and corrected my
course.

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:51.659
Right?
 

00:45:51.659 --> 00:45:54.556
"The educators must be
educated."

00:45:54.556 --> 00:45:55.110
Right?
 

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:57.510
I think it's a great sentence.
 

00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:01.110
Well, and one needs to discover
the role of the masses.

00:46:01.110 --> 00:46:04.867
Now that's very much Marx's
political project,

00:46:04.867 --> 00:46:05.869
coming in.
 

00:46:05.869 --> 00:46:08.000
But an important project. Right?
 

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.679
That you cannot do by yourself.
 

00:46:09.679 --> 00:46:10.059
Right?
 

00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:13.469
If you want to achieve
something, you have to

00:46:13.469 --> 00:46:14.400
cooperate.
 

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.320
You know?
 

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.648
You need cooperation with
others.

00:46:17.648 --> 00:46:18.230
Right?
 

00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:21.619
Otherwise nothing can be
achieved.

00:46:21.619 --> 00:46:28.250
Well Hegel's starting point was
abstract thinking.

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:33.543
Feuerbach, he's a materialist,
he thinks what is real is what

00:46:33.543 --> 00:46:36.280
we can grasp with our senses.
 

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.880
Marx said, "No.
 

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.320
This is sensuous practical
activity."

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.260
It has to be sensuous,
but it has to be practical.

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.768
This is something what
JÃ¼rgen Habermas loved,

00:46:47.768 --> 00:46:49.559
the German philosopher.
 

00:46:49.559 --> 00:46:54.342
He said, "This is the real
Marx, who sees the essence of

00:46:54.342 --> 00:46:58.409
all sensuous human activity
being the core."

00:46:58.409 --> 00:47:02.405
Later Marx is a reductionist,
because he reduces sensuous

00:47:02.405 --> 00:47:04.690
activity to economic activity.
 

00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:08.463
Here Marx perceives all
sensuous activity,

00:47:08.463 --> 00:47:13.525
including human interaction
between us, including sexual

00:47:13.525 --> 00:47:17.574
interaction among us,
as a sensuous activity.

00:47:17.574 --> 00:47:18.679
Right?
 

00:47:18.679 --> 00:47:19.909
As a material reality.
 

00:47:19.909 --> 00:47:25.804
There is not so much conflict
between Marx and Freud as it

00:47:25.804 --> 00:47:26.840
appears.
 

00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.900
Now let me go further.
 

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:33.085
VI.
 

00:47:33.085 --> 00:47:35.501
Old materialism looks at the
individual.

00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:36.059
Right?
 

00:47:36.059 --> 00:47:38.579
And this is Marx's big
obsession.

00:47:38.579 --> 00:47:42.251
The problem with modernity is
the isolated bourgeois

00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:45.398
individual,
and we have to overcome this

00:47:45.398 --> 00:47:49.077
isolated individual,
and we have to engage each

00:47:49.077 --> 00:47:51.230
other in human interaction.
 

00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:54.019
He is a communitarian, right?
 

00:47:54.019 --> 00:47:55.920
He is a communist, right?
 

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.670
He does not want to have
isolated individuals,

00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:59.159
right?
 

00:47:59.159 --> 00:48:02.030
He wants human interaction.
 

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:06.405
Well I'll skip this one:
religion is also a social

00:48:06.405 --> 00:48:07.300
product.
 

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:12.980
Social life is practical;
this is again quite obvious,

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.518
and I can probably skip this
one.

00:48:15.518 --> 00:48:18.353
And here again,
you know, the isolated

00:48:18.353 --> 00:48:20.690
individual;
that's the problem,

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:24.927
that you do not see that really
what we can achieve is always

00:48:24.927 --> 00:48:28.809
interacting with each other,
building on each other.

00:48:28.809 --> 00:48:32.630
A single individual will not
change anything.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:37.480
Well, and therefore we stand
for socialized humanity.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:41.900
The standpoint of old
materialism is civil society,

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:46.820
and the isolated bourgeois
individual in civil society,

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:49.570
and we are talking about a
human society,

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:53.621
where we are brothers and
sisters, where we have

00:48:53.621 --> 00:48:57.351
solidarity,
where we act in concert and in

00:48:57.351 --> 00:48:58.360
solidarity.
 

00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:05.181
And now comes the most
controversial pieces,

00:49:05.181 --> 00:49:09.940
what I hate and what I love.
 

00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:13.838
I love because again I think it
is wonderfully done,

00:49:13.838 --> 00:49:16.514
hate because it's desperately
wrong.

00:49:16.514 --> 00:49:17.280
Right?
 

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:21.793
Philosophers have only
interpreted the world in various

00:49:21.793 --> 00:49:22.380
ways.
 

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.090
The point is to change it.
 

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:27.766
In some ways,
this follows from the earlier

00:49:27.766 --> 00:49:29.780
ideas, namely praxis.
 

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:32.920
Truth is a practical question.
 

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:37.530
Philosophy only makes sense if
it changes your life.

00:49:37.530 --> 00:49:40.530
If you just read the philosophy
text,

00:49:40.530 --> 00:49:45.188
or the theoretical text,
for Foundations of Modern

00:49:45.188 --> 00:49:49.500
Social Thought,
to make sure that we will fall

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:52.224
asleep,
then the text did something

00:49:52.224 --> 00:49:54.530
wrong, and I did something
wrong.

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:55.179
Right?
 

00:49:55.179 --> 00:50:01.409
If the texts are right,
and if my lectures are right,

00:50:01.409 --> 00:50:04.690
if you start reading "The
Theses on Feuerbach",

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:08.090
you cannot fall asleep. Right?
 

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:12.534
You may have to take a sleeping
pill to quiet down and to sleep

00:50:12.534 --> 00:50:17.184
because the idea disturbs you,
because you feel now you have

00:50:17.184 --> 00:50:20.809
to change the world rather than
to accept it.

00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:22.679
All right.
 

00:50:22.679 --> 00:50:23.059
Thank you.
 

00:50:23.059 --> 00:50:28.000

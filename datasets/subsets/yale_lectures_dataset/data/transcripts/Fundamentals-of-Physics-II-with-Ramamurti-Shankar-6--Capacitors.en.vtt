00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.240
Prof: Let's turn to the
subject proper.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.590
I will start by doing the usual
stuff of just refreshing your

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.800
memory on what happened last
time.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.201
I mean, last time was pretty
heavy, a lot of mathematical

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:20.510
machinery which I like to work
with.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.896
Now, you might say,
"I'm going to be a

00:00:23.896 --> 00:00:28.412
psychologist or art historian,
and I don't need all those

00:00:28.412 --> 00:00:29.380
details.
 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.642
Just tell me what I need to get
through this course,"

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:34.990
so that's really a reasonable
question.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.403
I probably would have the same
attitude if I took a course in

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:40.360
your field.
 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.180
So here it is.
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.820
What I've told you so far is
that the electric field,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.970
which we understand now as
basically Coulomb's forces,

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.107
allows you to define a
potential because it's a

00:00:53.107 --> 00:00:54.540
conservative force.
 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.037
That means the integral of the
electric field on any closed

00:01:00.037 --> 00:01:05.251
loop is 0, and remember that's
what it takes to define a

00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:06.578
potential.
 

00:01:06.578 --> 00:01:10.058
And the electric force,
which is Q times

00:01:10.058 --> 00:01:13.310
E will also satisfy the
condition.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.327
That means we can define for
this problem a potential

00:01:19.327 --> 00:01:20.599
V.
 

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:25.340
This is called a potential.
 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.461
So that ½mv
_1^(2) (this is a

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:35.780
little v this is big
V) V(r

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.227
_1_ ) =
½

00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:45.629
mv_2^(2 )
V(r _2).

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:47.180
That is our goal.
 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.530
Ah, missed one mistake already.
 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.890
Anybody know what's missing
here?

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.160
Student: 
&gt;

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.030
Prof: Pardon me, yes?
 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.129
What's missing?
 

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.640
Student:  The charge.
 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.650
Prof: Yes, the charge.
 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.290
So this should really be
q times V and this

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.629
should be q times
V.

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:10.848
So let me remind you why it is.
 

00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:13.811
The force on any charge is
really not just the electric

00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:14.250
field.
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.439
It's q times the
electric field,

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:19.669
and therefore the potential
difference is associated with

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:22.840
the work done by the electric
field times q.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.438
So you've got to remember q
times V is the real

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:26.979
energy.
 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.770
So V is like an
electrical height.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.288
For example,
if this is the ground there's a

00:02:31.288 --> 00:02:32.520
mountain like that.
 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.240
You give me the height.
 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.430
The potential energy is not
just the height.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.240
It's mg times h.
 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.710
So let me say you give me
g times h.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.490
That's like the potential.
 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.646
That tells you the whole story
because if you want to lift a 1

00:02:45.646 --> 00:02:48.389
kilogram mass to that height you
do 1 times gh,

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:50.150
5 kilograms 5 times gh.
 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.110
So depending on the mass you
want to lift the work done will

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.068
be different and the potential
energy will be different,

00:02:56.068 --> 00:02:59.253
but this doesn't depend on the
mass you're planning to carry

00:02:59.253 --> 00:02:59.740
around.
 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.879
So you take out the mass.
 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.628
You can always put it back.
 

00:03:02.628 --> 00:03:06.798
Similarly the potential
concerns itself with the unit

00:03:06.798 --> 00:03:07.520
charge.
 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.181
If q were 1 nothing I
wrote is wrong,

00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:12.349
but in general q is not
1.

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.318
So this is the actual energy.
 

00:03:14.318 --> 00:03:17.878
So this is the old potential
energy you want.

00:03:17.878 --> 00:03:25.846
So the potential energy is
q times the potential,

00:03:25.846 --> 00:03:26.860
okay?
 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.206
So think of V as the
electrical height at a point and

00:03:30.206 --> 00:03:33.384
q is like the mass,
and q times V is

00:03:33.384 --> 00:03:34.520
like mgh.
 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.190
Okay, we've got a formula for
V.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.931
The general formula for
V is that V of

00:03:41.931 --> 00:03:46.185
r_2 minus
V of r_1

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:51.431
is the line integral of
E⋅dr

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:58.030
from r_1_
to r_2.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.568
This minus sign has the
following meaning.

00:04:00.568 --> 00:04:04.394
The electric field exerts the
force E on the unit

00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:06.361
charge,
but if you want to drag the

00:04:06.361 --> 00:04:08.764
charge against the field from
r_1to

00:04:08.764 --> 00:04:11.263
r_2 you apply
force minus E to

00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:13.324
compensate that,
and the work done by you,

00:04:13.324 --> 00:04:15.090
this really work done by you to
move it from

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.060
r_1 to
r_2.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.819
Let me give you the gravity
example.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:23.752
Gravitational force acts this
way, but if you want to lift

00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:26.790
something from here to here you
oppose it.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.699
Namely it's doing minus mg.
 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:31.310
Your force mg you move
it to height h.

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.437
That's the work you do,
and that you know is the

00:04:33.437 --> 00:04:35.610
potential at the top,
and that's potential at the

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.110
bottom.
 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.120
So that's the origin of the
minus sign.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.629
The electric field wants to go
one way,

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.298
and if you want to take it
against that force and raise it

00:04:44.298 --> 00:04:47.709
electrically speaking the force
you apply is precisely

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:48.610
-E.
 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.959
That ⋅dr is
the work done by you.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.250
That's what you invest.
 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.009
That's what you'll get back if
it rolls downhill again.

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.937
Now if you want V at
some point r minus

00:05:00.937 --> 00:05:06.245
V at infinity that
integral will be minus starting

00:05:06.245 --> 00:05:12.317
from infinity to the point--
these should be all vectors--to

00:05:12.317 --> 00:05:17.610
the point r of
E⋅dr.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.673
We will now take the convention
that V of infinity is

00:05:24.673 --> 00:05:26.230
equal to 0.
 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.110
Remember, potentials are
defined only by the differences

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.259
so you can put the 0 anywhere
you like.

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:34.339
We'll choose the 0 to be at
infinity.

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:36.639
Then in this integral it's
going to be 0,

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.322
and if you do this integral
from infinity to r you

00:05:40.322 --> 00:05:43.083
will find for 1 charge it is
q/4Π

00:05:43.083 --> 00:05:47.160
ε_0 times
r for a single charge,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:53.930
and r is the distance
from that charge.

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:56.629
It looks like Coulomb's Law but
a couple of differences.

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.745
There's no 1 over r^(2) and
there is no vector,

00:05:59.745 --> 00:06:00.220
okay?
 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:05.144
The potential due to a charge
here at the point here is a

00:06:05.144 --> 00:06:09.189
number given by this,
and if you've got lots of

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:11.740
charges that's just fine.
 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.120
V due to many charges is
sum over all those charges,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.805
the value of each charge
(divided) by

00:06:17.805 --> 00:06:22.206
4Πε_0 
times the length from where that

00:06:22.206 --> 00:06:25.639
charge is to where you want the
potential.

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:29.449
That's the principle of
superposition,

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:30.170
okay?
 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.550
The coulomb potential due to
one charge is 1 over r.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.483
Due to many charges is each
q times its own 1 over

00:06:37.483 --> 00:06:41.360
r times this 1 over
4Πε.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.750
And finally if you want the
potential difference due to the

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.783
field you integrate it,
and if you want the field from

00:06:49.783 --> 00:06:53.910
the potential you take the
derivative called the gradient,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.673
which is identical to minus
ix partial

00:06:59.673 --> 00:07:05.889
derivative minus jy
partial derivative.

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:07.803
You should expect two
derivatives because the force

00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:09.259
you are looking for now is a
vector.

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:12.197
You're living in 2D so you
cannot say the force is a

00:07:12.197 --> 00:07:15.019
derivative of the potential,
in what direction?

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:16.841
If you want the force in the
x direction take the

00:07:16.841 --> 00:07:17.569
x derivative.
 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:20.420
If you want it in the y
direction, take the y

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:21.060
derivative.
 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.651
And you put them together into
a single vector and that's the

00:07:24.651 --> 00:07:25.670
electric field.
 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.363
So you go from potential to the
field by taking the derivative

00:07:29.363 --> 00:07:32.026
or the gradient,
and you go from the field to

00:07:32.026 --> 00:07:34.449
the potential by doing the
integral.

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:37.372
Again, the subtlety is the
integral is of a dot product of

00:07:37.372 --> 00:07:40.399
E with a displacement,
because everything is a vector

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:40.810
now.
 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:43.298
It used to be fx dx in
the old days,

00:07:43.298 --> 00:07:46.555
but f has become a
vector, dx has become a

00:07:46.555 --> 00:07:49.459
vector dr so you need the
dot product.

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:55.060
Okay, so this is a summary,
but I want to make two course

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.959
corrections from last time.
 

00:07:57.959 --> 00:08:03.346
First one was when I tried to
prove to you that the electric

00:08:03.346 --> 00:08:08.733
field is conservative I did one
thing which I realized was a

00:08:08.733 --> 00:08:09.829
swindle.
 

00:08:09.829 --> 00:08:12.788
I didn't realize it myself and
I wasn't waiting for anyone to

00:08:12.788 --> 00:08:13.430
correct me.
 

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.790
I did not think about it hard
enough.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.339
So here is the mistake I made.
 

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:19.259
Remember what I said.
 

00:08:19.259 --> 00:08:21.670
I said that's a potential due
to point charge.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.230
I'm trying to look at it.
 

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.870
These are different lines of
the electric field.

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.220
Let's say you want to go from
here to here.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:32.168
You do some work,
E⋅dr

00:08:32.168 --> 00:08:33.678
along this line.
 

00:08:33.678 --> 00:08:36.885
The claim was that's the same
work you do if I take another

00:08:36.885 --> 00:08:40.102
path that looks like this,
go this way,

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:44.269
go that way,
and go that way,

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:47.269
same work, and that's still a
correct statement.

00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:51.336
It's the same work because here
dr is angular,

00:08:51.336 --> 00:08:54.465
E is radial,
the dot product is 0,

00:08:54.465 --> 00:08:56.029
likewise 0 here.
 

00:08:56.029 --> 00:08:59.008
At every segment you have here
E is radial,

00:08:59.008 --> 00:09:01.924
dr is radial,
the dot product is the field

00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:03.808
E times that length.
 

00:09:03.808 --> 00:09:07.494
Here it's the field here times
that length, but the field is

00:09:07.494 --> 00:09:10.679
constant at a given radius so
they're also equal;

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:14.048
still no wrong statements.
 

00:09:14.048 --> 00:09:17.298
Then I said,
"What if I do this,

00:09:17.298 --> 00:09:20.820
a little radial,
a little angular and so

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.980
on," and that's also okay.
 

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.102
Then I finally said,
"What if I have some nice

00:09:27.102 --> 00:09:29.720
smooth path,
which is not made up of radial

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.850
and angular,"
and my claim was,

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:36.470
well, you take for this
segment, for example,

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:40.009
you take a radial segment,
then you take an angular

00:09:40.009 --> 00:09:42.043
segment,
then you may take another

00:09:42.043 --> 00:09:44.250
radial segment and another
angular segment.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.389
So you approximate the smooth
pass by a bunch of radial,

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:49.967
angular, radial,
angular, and from a long

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:54.538
distance it all looks the same,
so it should be the same amount

00:09:54.538 --> 00:09:55.230
of work.
 

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:56.918
That's wrong.
 

00:09:56.918 --> 00:10:00.309
I'll give you an example of why
such arguments can be wrong.

00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:03.019
Let's take a triangle.
 

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:05.899
This side is 1,
and this side is 1,

00:10:05.899 --> 00:10:09.288
and I want to walk from here to
there.

00:10:09.288 --> 00:10:13.292
So you know I go a distance
√2, but then you say I'm

00:10:13.292 --> 00:10:15.610
going to take a different path.
 

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.398
I'm going to go horizontal,
vertical, horizontal,

00:10:18.398 --> 00:10:20.490
vertical, equal amounts like
that.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.870
And these are very tiny
differences.

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.371
You can say it's the same
thing, but this path is of

00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:27.519
length two.
 

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:29.090
Understand why?
 

00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:31.490
All the horizontal parts add up
to 1.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:35.769
All the vertical parts add up
to 1, so going zigzag is longer

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:37.408
by a factor √2.
 

00:10:37.408 --> 00:10:39.839
So just because things are
approximately the same it

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:42.792
doesn't mean the answer will be
the same because if you make an

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:45.553
infinite number of infinitesimal
mistakes you can add up to

00:10:45.553 --> 00:10:46.649
something finite.
 

00:10:46.649 --> 00:10:50.062
Likewise here,
you've got to make sure that

00:10:50.062 --> 00:10:55.017
when you deform your path from
what was really given to you to

00:10:55.017 --> 00:10:58.589
what you did,
which is radial and angular,

00:10:58.589 --> 00:11:01.149
the work done should be the
same.

00:11:01.149 --> 00:11:03.720
The path length is clearly not
the same in this example,

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.288
and it can all add up,
but the work will be the same.

00:11:06.288 --> 00:11:08.678
That is what I did not show to
you.

00:11:08.678 --> 00:11:13.581
So let me take a segment here
where that's the radial part and

00:11:13.581 --> 00:11:17.485
an angular part,
but the person really wanted it

00:11:17.485 --> 00:11:21.928
on that segment along some
straight line joining the two.

00:11:21.928 --> 00:11:25.864
What I want to show you is that
not only does that approximate

00:11:25.864 --> 00:11:27.975
this,
from a long distance,

00:11:27.975 --> 00:11:32.230
the work done on that plus that
is the work done here,

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.678
okay?
 

00:11:32.678 --> 00:11:36.605
So for your convenience I'm
going to blow up that picture

00:11:36.605 --> 00:11:39.970
here so you can all see what I'm
trying to do.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:44.080
This should be the radial
direction.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.899
This is the radial direction.
 

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:47.350
This is E.
 

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:50.880
This is some perpendicular
direction, and this is the

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.210
direction in which the move
dr was made.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.808
That's the actual path.
 

00:11:55.808 --> 00:12:00.028
It's going like that,
and you manage to just deform

00:12:00.028 --> 00:12:00.450
it.
 

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.009
So what's the line integral on
the radial path?

00:12:04.009 --> 00:12:07.469
Well, it's the magnitude of the
electric field at that distance

00:12:07.469 --> 00:12:11.038
times the difference in radius
between this and then this end.

00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:14.798
Let me call it delta r,
delta r is the spacing

00:12:14.798 --> 00:12:17.408
here between that curve and that
curve.

00:12:17.408 --> 00:12:19.210
We agree the dot product is
trivial.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.379
E is this way.
 

00:12:20.379 --> 00:12:23.190
Displacement is this way,
no cause thetas to worry about.

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.389
That's the work done.
 

00:12:25.389 --> 00:12:29.340
Work done here is 0 because
perpendicular to the field.

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.879
So that's the total work done
going like that.

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:33.710
How about going along this line?
 

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.424
It's going to be
E(r)⋅

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:38.538
dr.
 

00:12:38.538 --> 00:12:40.620
When I say E at
r, r is,

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.710
of course, not 1 point it's
kind of spread out,

00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:45.570
but this is an infinite decimal
region,

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.868
so you can talk about the
E at one point and not

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:49.058
worry about the variation.
 

00:12:49.058 --> 00:12:51.798
So don't forget it's an
infinite decimal triangle.

00:12:51.798 --> 00:12:54.764
E⋅dr
will be E at the distance

00:12:54.764 --> 00:12:57.855
r,
the length of dr and the

00:12:57.855 --> 00:13:02.240
cosine of the angle between them
which is this angle.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.958
The length of dr times
cosine is precisely that

00:13:06.958 --> 00:13:12.390
distance, Δr and
therefore you do the same amount

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.460
of work.
 

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.129
So basically I am saying I
should wander around.

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:18.769
You may not choose to go radial
angle or radial angular.

00:13:18.769 --> 00:13:21.850
If you go at a slant to the
radial the work you do really

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.490
depends on how much radial
distance you cover.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.304
That's what
E⋅dr

00:13:26.304 --> 00:13:26.970
does for you.
 

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:31.124
That's why you can deform the
fact anyway and get the same

00:13:31.124 --> 00:13:31.779
answer.
 

00:13:31.779 --> 00:13:33.538
That's the first thing.
 

00:13:33.538 --> 00:13:41.440
Second thing is I forgot to
tell you anything about units.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.921
So the electric field is force
on the unit charge,

00:13:45.921 --> 00:13:50.220
so the unit for that is
Newton's per coulomb.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:54.046
The electric potential looks
like the work done on a unit

00:13:54.046 --> 00:13:58.697
charge,
so the units for that is joules

00:13:58.697 --> 00:14:03.048
per coulomb,
and the name for joules per

00:14:03.048 --> 00:14:04.850
coulomb is a volt.
 

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:09.936
It means if there's a voltage
difference between two points of

00:14:09.936 --> 00:14:14.690
12 volts it's going to take you
12 joules of work to lug a

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:19.110
coulomb from the lower point to
the higher point.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:23.308
So you guys have to get your
units right, okay?

00:14:23.308 --> 00:14:26.950
Now, you might say,
"Why don't you use

00:14:26.950 --> 00:14:28.769
units," right?
 

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:30.320
You know why?
 

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.816
Because I have tenure;
when you have tenure you don't

00:14:35.816 --> 00:14:37.360
have to use units.
 

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:39.629
I park next to the fire hydrant.
 

00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:40.360
I have tenure.
 

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.200
I tear up the tickets.
 

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.389
I don't do jury duty.
 

00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:45.169
I don't pay taxes,
you don't have to do anything

00:14:45.169 --> 00:14:48.484
when you reach--and Alan is
going to tell you the joys of

00:14:48.484 --> 00:14:50.200
being a graduate student.
 

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.769
The joys of being tenured prof
are hard to describe,

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:55.029
okay, priceless.
 

00:14:55.029 --> 00:14:58.692
In fact, one of my sons,
when he saw my lifestyle,

00:14:58.692 --> 00:15:02.879
said it reminded him of a
jellyfish deep in the ocean.

00:15:02.879 --> 00:15:06.816
As soon as the little guy can
crawl he attaches himself to a

00:15:06.816 --> 00:15:08.578
rock,
and he never moves,

00:15:08.578 --> 00:15:12.461
and eats his own brain for food
because he has no further use

00:15:12.461 --> 00:15:13.110
for it.
 

00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:16.697
So apparently that's what I
reminded him of,

00:15:16.697 --> 00:15:17.450
anyway.
 

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:21.480
So you can, if you work hard,
you can be like me,

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.070
okay?
 

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.408
You can do that.
 

00:15:23.408 --> 00:15:24.894
Anyway, look,
so you guys have to get the

00:15:24.894 --> 00:15:26.703
units,
because seriously speaking if

00:15:26.703 --> 00:15:29.601
you don't write any units we
don't know if you're right or

00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:31.149
wrong,
right?

00:15:31.149 --> 00:15:34.232
For any problem the answer is
19 in some units,

00:15:34.232 --> 00:15:34.769
right?
 

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:36.865
So if you don't give the units
the number is not worth

00:15:36.865 --> 00:15:37.298
anything.
 

00:15:37.298 --> 00:15:40.399
Another advantage of units is
you can keep track of your

00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.190
calculation.
 

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.080
You multiply one quantity by
another quantity.

00:15:43.080 --> 00:15:43.990
Everything has units.
 

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.779
You cross out the lengths and
the meters.

00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.350
You've got to make sure the
stuff you get has the right

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.538
units on the two sides.
 

00:15:49.538 --> 00:15:53.610
That helps you also keep track
of calculations.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.210
Okay, so let's go back now.
 

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.600
This is all stuff left over
from before.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.259
So now for the new stuff.
 

00:15:59.259 --> 00:16:05.826
I'm going to tell you the first
part of this lecture is going to

00:16:05.826 --> 00:16:10.100
be what are the advantages of
V.

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.970
I will just mention them.
 

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:13.120
Then I will elaborate on them.
 

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:19.509
The first advantage is the
conservation of energy.

00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:24.610
The second advantage is the
computation of E,

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:30.110
and the third advantage is a
lot of good visual pictures

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.808
which are very helpful.
 

00:16:32.808 --> 00:16:36.385
So you won't know what these
mean, but this is what we're

00:16:36.385 --> 00:16:39.259
going to do so you know where we
are going.

00:16:39.259 --> 00:16:40.769
First thing is conservation of
energy,

00:16:40.769 --> 00:16:42.808
there's no need to belabor this
point,

00:16:42.808 --> 00:16:45.048
I mean, that's why we did the
whole thing,

00:16:45.048 --> 00:16:48.529
the whole conservative forces,
gradient,

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:51.427
this, that, all that was to
make sure in the end you can get

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:52.950
a potential energy out of it.
 

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:56.399
And as you know from the roller
coaster problem if you can do

00:16:56.399 --> 00:16:59.907
kinetic plus potential = kinetic
plus potential it saves you a

00:16:59.907 --> 00:17:01.000
lot of trouble.
 

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.471
In other words,
in this room right now there's

00:17:03.471 --> 00:17:06.586
a lot of electric fields,
a lot of charges everywhere

00:17:06.586 --> 00:17:09.330
applying a field here,
and I want to carry a charge

00:17:09.330 --> 00:17:11.440
from here and I want to drag it
over here,

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.618
or maybe the charge was shot by
a cyclotron or something.

00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:18.806
It came flying out at some
speed here, and it comes here a

00:17:18.806 --> 00:17:21.743
little later,
and I want to know how fast

00:17:21.743 --> 00:17:22.920
it's moving.
 

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.568
One way to do that is to follow
the charge as it moves.

00:17:25.568 --> 00:17:27.680
At every instant find the force
on it,

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.250
the acceleration from that,
change in velocity,

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.298
add up all the changes you'll
get the final velocity,

00:17:33.298 --> 00:17:35.800
but as you know with the law of
the conservation of energy you

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.358
can skip all the intermediate
stuff.

00:17:37.358 --> 00:17:39.723
You just have to know the
initial kinetic energy,

00:17:39.723 --> 00:17:41.990
initial potential energy,
final kinetic energy,

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:43.318
final potential energy.
 

00:17:43.318 --> 00:17:45.784
They are equal,
if you sum them- so you can

00:17:45.784 --> 00:17:47.309
find one number from it.
 

00:17:47.309 --> 00:17:48.920
One of the numbers you can find.
 

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.083
In particular if you didn't
know the final kinetic energy

00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:53.098
you can find it.
 

00:17:53.098 --> 00:17:56.538
So that's the first advantage,
conservation of energy.

00:17:56.538 --> 00:18:01.922
Second thing is that it makes
life easy when you want to

00:18:01.922 --> 00:18:04.759
compute the electric field.
 

00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:07.358
So this is an example I did,
again,

00:18:07.358 --> 00:18:11.595
near the end of the class,
and I think it was needlessly

00:18:11.595 --> 00:18:14.454
complicated,
so I will try to repeat the

00:18:14.454 --> 00:18:18.497
derivation a little more quickly
because it's a lot easier than I

00:18:18.497 --> 00:18:19.950
gave the impression.
 

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.964
So we are trying to find,
let us say, the electric field

00:18:24.964 --> 00:18:30.071
you'll do a dipole -q and
 q separated by a

00:18:30.071 --> 00:18:32.170
distance 2a.
 

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:35.391
If you did it with forces,
with forces I didn't even try

00:18:35.391 --> 00:18:36.680
to do it everywhere.
 

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:41.400
I remember I did it here and I
did it there.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:43.099
The force here was like this.
 

00:18:43.099 --> 00:18:44.450
The force there was like that.
 

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:51.640
Then I said if you do a lot of
work you'll get all these lines.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:54.509
What makes life difficult is
that if you go to this point

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:56.593
here,
this I explain to you last

00:18:56.593 --> 00:18:59.618
time, this guy will repel it
with some force,

00:18:59.618 --> 00:19:02.058
this guy will attract it,
and you've got to add the two

00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:03.368
arrows and get a new arrow.
 

00:19:03.368 --> 00:19:06.769
That's the net electric field
at that point.

00:19:06.769 --> 00:19:11.027
So you've got to add arrows and
that's more difficult than

00:19:11.027 --> 00:19:15.509
adding the potential which is
just a number form this guy and

00:19:15.509 --> 00:19:16.480
that guy.
 

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.584
Then once you've got the
potential you find the field by

00:19:19.584 --> 00:19:20.769
taking derivatives.
 

00:19:20.769 --> 00:19:23.003
You want E_x
take the x derivative,

00:19:23.003 --> 00:19:23.660
the minus sign.
 

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:26.007
If you want E_y
you take minus

00:19:26.007 --> 00:19:27.130
dV/dy.
 

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:28.578
So what's the E here?
 

00:19:28.578 --> 00:19:32.699
You remember it's
q/4Πε

00:19:32.699 --> 00:19:37.872
_0 times
[1/r^( ) (r^( ) is

00:19:37.872 --> 00:19:41.799
that length) −
1/r^(-)].

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:42.410
That's it.
 

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:45.859
No arrows, nothing,
that's the total V.

00:19:45.859 --> 00:19:48.220
This is r^(-).
 

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.914
Let's define r to be if
you want the distance from the

00:19:52.914 --> 00:19:53.618
center.
 

00:19:53.618 --> 00:19:56.890
And I want you to imagine this
is long way off.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:59.779
This picture is not drawn to
scale.

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:04.349
You should imagine these two
points are like this and I'm

00:20:04.349 --> 00:20:05.818
somewhere there.
 

00:20:05.818 --> 00:20:08.619
That's when the dipole
approximation's working.

00:20:08.619 --> 00:20:09.599
This is not an approximation.
 

00:20:09.599 --> 00:20:11.420
This is exact.
 

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.150
So let's do the following then.
 

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.500
We come by the denominators.
 

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:22.093
You get r^( ) times
r^(-). Numerators

00:20:22.093 --> 00:20:26.118
r^(-) −
r^( ).

00:20:26.118 --> 00:20:29.925
Now, you can see that r^(
) and r^(-) differ

00:20:29.925 --> 00:20:33.400
from r because of this
little guy a.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.527
If you use the law of cosines
you know it's that squared plus

00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:39.548
that squared minus 2ar
cosine theta or something.

00:20:39.548 --> 00:20:43.023
In the bottom we ignore that
difference and we write

00:20:43.023 --> 00:20:46.838
everything as 4Πε
_0r^(2).

00:20:46.838 --> 00:20:49.707
In other words r^( ) I
approximate with r,

00:20:49.707 --> 00:20:51.950
r^(-) I approximate with
r.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.558
So this is not the exact answer.
 

00:20:54.558 --> 00:20:58.465
There are corrections here that
look like 1 plus maybe a number

00:20:58.465 --> 00:21:01.805
a divided by r and also
a^(2) divided by

00:21:01.805 --> 00:21:05.980
r^(2),
but these are all negligible.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.376
In the numerator you can again
say, "Hey,

00:21:08.376 --> 00:21:11.467
why don't you replace this by
r and this by r

00:21:11.467 --> 00:21:12.799
then you get 0?"
 

00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:13.548
It is true.
 

00:21:13.548 --> 00:21:17.121
If you replace everything by
r then you do get 0 and

00:21:17.121 --> 00:21:20.939
that's because in the difference
the big guy cancels and what's

00:21:20.939 --> 00:21:24.634
left over in the difference is
what's going to keep this from

00:21:24.634 --> 00:21:25.618
vanishing.
 

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:28.791
So we have to find the
difference in that distance and

00:21:28.791 --> 00:21:29.750
that distance.
 

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:34.150
So for that what you do you
draw a line here.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:36.788
Now, you cannot draw a real
perpendicular here,

00:21:36.788 --> 00:21:40.057
but if these things are very
far and these lines are almost

00:21:40.057 --> 00:21:42.650
parallel you can draw a
perpendicular there.

00:21:42.650 --> 00:21:48.112
Then if that angle is theta,
theta is the angle then it's

00:21:48.112 --> 00:21:53.476
very easy to show that this
distance is simply 2a

00:21:53.476 --> 00:21:59.230
cosine theta because if theta is
this angle then you can say

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:04.887
cosine of this angle here will
be by whatever complimentary

00:22:04.887 --> 00:22:08.788
angle is 2a cosine theta.
 

00:22:08.788 --> 00:22:13.798
Therefore in the top I have
2a times cosine theta,

00:22:13.798 --> 00:22:20.433
and that I will write as dipole
moment p cosine theta

00:22:20.433 --> 00:22:25.720
over 4Πε
_0r^(2).

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:26.609
That's what I was trying to get.
 

00:22:26.609 --> 00:22:27.588
Yep?
 

00:22:27.588 --> 00:22:29.088
Student:  Sorry,
which angle is theta?

00:22:29.088 --> 00:22:36.640
Prof: Theta is the angle
measured from here.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:39.848
Let me draw this.
 

00:22:39.848 --> 00:22:42.820
One can worry about is it this
angle or that angle,

00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:45.494
but I'm saying draw the angle
from the middle,

00:22:45.494 --> 00:22:46.029
okay?
 

00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:50.170
That angle is theta,
and roughly speaking that angle

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.470
is also theta.
 

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:58.429
Now drop a perpendicular here
and this side is 2a,

00:22:58.429 --> 00:23:05.140
therefore this difference is
2a cosine theta.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:08.358
So now I have V in terms
of r and theta,

00:23:08.358 --> 00:23:10.998
but I can write it in terms of
x and y very

00:23:10.998 --> 00:23:11.842
easily,
it is

00:23:11.842 --> 00:23:15.640
p/4Πε
_0r^(2),

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.788
and cosine theta is
x/r.

00:23:17.788 --> 00:23:24.502
So the whole thing is
x/r^(3) which is

00:23:24.502 --> 00:23:28.846
the same as
x/(x^(2)

00:23:28.846 --> 00:23:33.868
y^(2))^(3/2),
right?

00:23:33.868 --> 00:23:37.634
r is the square root and
r^(3) is three powers of

00:23:37.634 --> 00:23:38.058
that.
 

00:23:38.058 --> 00:23:40.980
Now, you can easily take the
derivative of this guy with

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.690
respect to x,
or with respect to y.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.519
Derivatives are very easy to
take.

00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:47.140
Integrals are hard to do.
 

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.198
And that'll give you the
electric field

00:23:49.198 --> 00:23:52.231
E_x and
E_y everywhere,

00:23:52.231 --> 00:23:52.720
okay?
 

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.288
So E_x is
equal to -dV/dx,

00:23:55.288 --> 00:23:57.630
and E_y is
-dV/dy.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.866
It's one of the homework
problems is to really calculate

00:24:00.866 --> 00:24:01.278
this.
 

00:24:01.278 --> 00:24:15.489
And if you calculate it and you
plot it you will see this thing

00:24:15.489 --> 00:24:18.009
emerging.
 

00:24:18.009 --> 00:24:24.011
Okay, in other problems most of
the time it's easy to find V

00:24:24.011 --> 00:24:27.108
and then to find E.
 

00:24:27.108 --> 00:24:31.163
For example,
if I have a ring of charge and

00:24:31.163 --> 00:24:36.856
I want to find the V here
then let's say the ring has

00:24:36.856 --> 00:24:41.490
charge of q and some
radius a.

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:45.508
Then a little guy here produces
a little potential dV

00:24:45.508 --> 00:24:49.527
which is the charge dq
(dq is not any distance

00:24:49.527 --> 00:24:53.272
it's like the differential)
divided by 4Πε

00:24:53.272 --> 00:24:54.839
_0.
 

00:24:54.839 --> 00:24:56.338
And what's the distance?
 

00:24:56.338 --> 00:25:04.558
If that is z then simply
a root of z squared a^(2).

00:25:04.558 --> 00:25:07.387
That's due to this little
charge, but every unit of charge

00:25:07.387 --> 00:25:09.819
on this ring is equal distance
from this point.

00:25:09.819 --> 00:25:10.460
You understand?
 

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:13.240
It's a ring and I'm
perpendicular to the ring.

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.282
So they all contribute the same
number and sum of all the

00:25:17.282 --> 00:25:19.808
dq's is just the
q.

00:25:19.808 --> 00:25:23.788
So that's the potential on the
axis.

00:25:23.788 --> 00:25:31.309
Remember, you can take a
z derivative to get the

00:25:31.309 --> 00:25:33.259
field, okay?
 

00:25:33.259 --> 00:25:36.858
Generally it is easier to do
the V.

00:25:36.858 --> 00:25:41.054
Either it's a sum or integral
over the charges producing the

00:25:41.054 --> 00:25:43.400
V then take derivatives.
 

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.989
But I want to give you one
example in which the opposite is

00:25:48.989 --> 00:25:51.587
true,
where in fact it's easier to

00:25:51.587 --> 00:25:53.940
get E than to get
V,

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.130
and that is--there are many
such examples.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.950
I'm just giving you one.
 

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:02.049
Let's say there's a hollow
conducting sphere.

00:26:02.049 --> 00:26:03.920
It's got charge Q.
 

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:11.048
So this guy's hollow and
conducting.

00:26:11.048 --> 00:26:14.970
I want to find the potential
everywhere due to this,

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:19.660
and the charge Q is
uniformly spread on the surface.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:22.558
So what's going to be the
potential?

00:26:22.558 --> 00:26:24.829
First of all,
by symmetry you can see that if

00:26:24.829 --> 00:26:28.080
you pick any point anywhere the
answer's going to depend only on

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.125
the radial distance from the
center because it has spherical

00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:31.900
symmetry.
 

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:35.135
But you still have a lot of
hard work to do because you can

00:26:35.135 --> 00:26:37.868
divide the sphere into little
rings like this,

00:26:37.868 --> 00:26:40.432
slice it at different
latitudes, and find the

00:26:40.432 --> 00:26:43.635
potential due to each ring using
this formula I just did

00:26:43.635 --> 00:26:46.286
somewhere,
then integrate it over all the

00:26:46.286 --> 00:26:48.358
rings and you will get an
answer,

00:26:48.358 --> 00:26:53.220
but that's a decent amount of
calculus.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:58.805
But you don't have to do that
because in this problem because

00:26:58.805 --> 00:27:04.390
it's spherically symmetric and
there's a charge Q here

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:09.694
we know from Gauss's Law the
electric field is going to be

00:27:09.694 --> 00:27:15.094
purely radial and will look like
Q/4Πε

00:27:15.094 --> 00:27:20.307
_0r^(2) as long
as r is outside this

00:27:20.307 --> 00:27:21.890
sphere.
 

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:23.828
So here's one problem where
it's easier to get

00:27:23.828 --> 00:27:25.746
E because E is
pretty trivial,

00:27:25.746 --> 00:27:26.368
it's radial.
 

00:27:26.368 --> 00:27:28.028
You just need to know the
magnitude.

00:27:28.028 --> 00:27:29.538
Gauss's Law tells you the
magnitude.

00:27:29.538 --> 00:27:32.720
You put the unit vector back
and you get this.

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:37.130
So as long as you're outside
this sphere it's as if Q

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.345
were sitting at the origin and
the potential

00:27:40.345 --> 00:27:43.896
V(r),
which is -Q

00:27:43.896 --> 00:27:48.096
Q/4
Πε_0r

00:27:48.096 --> 00:27:51.740
outside that sphere,
because remember

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.291
V(r) minus
V of infinity is equal to

00:27:56.291 --> 00:27:59.625
integral of
E⋅dr

00:27:59.625 --> 00:28:03.690
from infinity to r with a
minus sign,

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.164
and if you just take the field
of a point charge and do the

00:28:07.164 --> 00:28:10.280
integral you will get the
potential of a point charge

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.358
which is this.
 

00:28:11.358 --> 00:28:17.015
So if I draw the potential as a
function of radius it will look

00:28:17.015 --> 00:28:22.670
exactly like that of a point
charge falling like 1/r.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:24.940
Now, what about for r
less than r?

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:28.058
How do I continue this graph?
 

00:28:28.058 --> 00:28:31.279
Student: 
&gt;

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:33.130
Prof: Pardon me?
 

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:34.038
Student:  Use Gauss's
Law.

00:28:34.038 --> 00:28:34.940
Prof: You can use
Gauss's Law.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.609
If you use Gauss's Law inside
what will you get for E?

00:28:37.609 --> 00:28:38.369
Student:  0.
 

00:28:38.369 --> 00:28:39.558
Prof: E is 0.
 

00:28:39.558 --> 00:28:41.993
Integral of
E⋅dr

00:28:41.993 --> 00:28:45.141
is 0, so potential does not
change inside this sphere,

00:28:45.141 --> 00:28:47.220
but don't think potential is 0.
 

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:48.799
It does not change.
 

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:52.130
It's stuck at this value.
 

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:57.198
So throughout the hollow sphere
there's only one potential,

00:28:57.198 --> 00:28:57.808
okay?
 

00:28:57.808 --> 00:28:59.250
Electric field is a different
story.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.617
Electric field is,
in fact, 0 inside then falls

00:29:02.617 --> 00:29:04.230
like 1/r^(2).
 

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.690
The electric potential is a
constant.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:10.674
So there are certain problems
like a cylinder of charge

00:29:10.674 --> 00:29:13.440
surrounded by another cylinder
of charge where,

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.887
again, it's easier to get
E from symmetry arguments

00:29:18.887 --> 00:29:23.858
then integrate that E to
get the potential.

00:29:23.858 --> 00:29:26.288
Okay, so this is my second
point.

00:29:26.288 --> 00:29:29.670
Namely, barring a few
exceptions like this one,

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.476
with high symmetry the
potential has the advantage that

00:29:32.476 --> 00:29:35.595
it lets us compute the electric
field by first doing a sum of

00:29:35.595 --> 00:29:37.829
scalar quantities rather than
vectors,

00:29:37.829 --> 00:29:40.380
then taking derivatives.
 

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:45.371
The third advantage has to do
with being able to visualize

00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:46.160
things.
 

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:51.269
It gives you a landscape and
that's intuitively very helpful.

00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:52.950
So here's one example.
 

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:59.910
Let's take two parallel plates
and put a lot of plus charge

00:29:59.910 --> 00:30:05.308
here and equal amount of minus
charge here.

00:30:05.308 --> 00:30:07.670
What will the electric field
look like in this region?

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:09.814
Let's say both have the same
density σ

00:30:09.814 --> 00:30:11.660
for unit area and they're
infinite.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.798
I'm just showing you a finite
portion.

00:30:14.798 --> 00:30:17.452
This guy will produce sigma
over

00:30:17.452 --> 00:30:21.390
2ε_0
here and here.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:25.690
This one, because of negative
charge, will do this;

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.940
σ/2ε
_0 on this side.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:34.192
In the region between them you
can see the two arrows are

00:30:34.192 --> 00:30:37.608
additive, so the field will look
like this.

00:30:37.608 --> 00:30:40.160
In the region outside the two
arrows are opposite.

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.960
This guy's coming in.
 

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:42.318
That guy's going out.
 

00:30:42.318 --> 00:30:44.083
And remember,
the field doesn't diminish with

00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:46.568
distance due to either plate so
they can completely cancel each

00:30:46.568 --> 00:30:46.970
other.
 

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.757
So the electric field is
trapped between the two plates,

00:30:50.757 --> 00:30:54.818
and has the strength which is
double what you have on either

00:30:54.818 --> 00:30:57.230
side if you had only one sheet.
 

00:30:57.230 --> 00:31:02.589
That's the electric field
E.

00:31:02.589 --> 00:31:04.200
That's my electric field.
 

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:05.817
You can ask,
"What's the potential

00:31:05.817 --> 00:31:07.777
difference,"
or "What's the potential

00:31:07.777 --> 00:31:08.970
at various points?"
 

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.839
This whole thing being metallic
is at one potential.

00:31:12.839 --> 00:31:17.038
I say V = 0.
 

00:31:17.038 --> 00:31:19.548
Throughout this line let's say
V is 0.

00:31:19.548 --> 00:31:21.943
In fact it's very clear
V is 0 because if I move

00:31:21.943 --> 00:31:24.426
horizontally on this line I
don't do any work because the

00:31:24.426 --> 00:31:26.288
electric field is perpendicular
to me.

00:31:26.288 --> 00:31:30.086
So if V was 0 at one
point it is 0 throughout this

00:31:30.086 --> 00:31:30.630
plane.
 

00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:32.160
Yes, I should qualify this
statement.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.700
You cannot pick V equal
to 0 over an extended region.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.130
You have freedom to pick it to
be 0 at one point,

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:42.471
but I'm telling you if you pick
the one point in this plane you

00:31:42.471 --> 00:31:45.596
can navigate throughout the
plane without changing V

00:31:45.596 --> 00:31:48.130
because you move perpendicular
to E.

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:49.940
So V is 0 in the lower
plate,

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:53.933
but it won't be 0 anywhere
else, but you can see that may

00:31:53.933 --> 00:31:56.702
be V = 1,
that may be V = 2,

00:31:56.702 --> 00:32:01.530
V = 3,
upper plate maybe V = 4

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:02.460
volts.
 

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:07.083
So lines of E are
vertical and lines of constant

00:32:07.083 --> 00:32:09.308
V are horizontal.
 

00:32:09.308 --> 00:32:11.220
This is really like the
gravitational problem.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.336
An electric field raining down
on you is just like the force of

00:32:14.336 --> 00:32:14.839
gravity.
 

00:32:14.839 --> 00:32:17.259
This might as well be gh.
 

00:32:17.259 --> 00:32:18.630
This might as well be g.
 

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:20.778
You multiply a mass you get
mg.

00:32:20.778 --> 00:32:23.778
You multiply by the q
you get the force on the charge.

00:32:23.778 --> 00:32:27.182
It's straight down and the
potential just increases with

00:32:27.182 --> 00:32:27.740
height.
 

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:29.220
Yep?
 

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.454
Student:  Can you just
go over real quick,

00:32:32.454 --> 00:32:36.365
please, how you do the calculus
to get the constant voltage

00:32:36.365 --> 00:32:37.309
_________?
 

00:32:37.309 --> 00:32:38.538
Prof: Oh, okay.
 

00:32:38.538 --> 00:32:41.690
Think of it as a plate coming
outside the blackboard.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.358
Student:  For the hollow
sphere.

00:32:43.358 --> 00:32:45.250
Prof: Oh,
for the hollow sphere.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:49.059
The potential is always the
work done to go from infinity to

00:32:49.059 --> 00:32:50.740
wherever you are,
right?

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:54.308
So when I come from here what
do I think is at the origin?

00:32:54.308 --> 00:32:56.829
I think there is a point charge
at the origin,

00:32:56.829 --> 00:32:59.519
so I pushed up against that
until I come here.

00:32:59.519 --> 00:33:00.710
So I do that amount of work.
 

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:04.299
Once I'm in here there is no
electric field inside,

00:33:04.299 --> 00:33:06.048
so
E⋅dr

00:33:06.048 --> 00:33:08.221
is 0 from then on,
but don't forget the V

00:33:08.221 --> 00:33:09.750
that you got up to that point.
 

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:10.859
You don't drop it.
 

00:33:10.859 --> 00:33:13.440
You keep on adding 0 to it.
 

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.528
So it is 0 everywhere.
 

00:33:14.528 --> 00:33:18.479
You add 0 to all points here
because you can go from here to

00:33:18.479 --> 00:33:20.220
here, no electric field.
 

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:28.348
So the whole sphere has the
same potential as the surface.

00:33:28.348 --> 00:33:31.487
So now, here I've got this
potentials and it gives you a

00:33:31.487 --> 00:33:34.739
picture that you're running
uphill and these are the steps

00:33:34.739 --> 00:33:36.848
you've got to climb to go
uphill.

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:42.222
And if you've got 4 volts here,
if you take a coulomb and you

00:33:42.222 --> 00:33:47.416
let it drop it'll pick up 4
joules by the time it hits this

00:33:47.416 --> 00:33:48.849
lower plate.
 

00:33:48.849 --> 00:33:50.019
That's the meaning.
 

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:53.412
That's the work done by the
electric field just like gravity

00:33:53.412 --> 00:33:56.690
is the potential difference
which is the work done on unit

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:59.680
charge times the charge which is
1 coulomb here.

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.210
If it was 10 coulombs you do 40
joules of work.

00:34:03.210 --> 00:34:06.604
If an electron is released
you've got to be a little

00:34:06.604 --> 00:34:07.269
careful.
 

00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:11.309
By definition the charge of an
electron is negative.

00:34:11.309 --> 00:34:15.780
See, if an electron is released
here in fact it'll go like this.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:18.139
You don't have any analogs in
gravity.

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.449
Gravity everything falls down.
 

00:34:19.449 --> 00:34:22.135
Suppose some things had
negative mass and some things

00:34:22.135 --> 00:34:23.170
had positive mass.
 

00:34:23.170 --> 00:34:25.949
All guys with negative mass
you've got to nail them to the

00:34:25.949 --> 00:34:27.949
ground otherwise they'll just
float up.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.724
That happens in electricity,
so any electron you leave here

00:34:31.724 --> 00:34:32.570
will go up.
 

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.972
So the force on the electron is
-q times E,

00:34:35.972 --> 00:34:38.219
so everything has got a minus
sign.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:42.833
So an electron going from here
to here will in fact lose

00:34:42.833 --> 00:34:43.590
energy.
 

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:47.179
We will lose potential energy
and it will gain and turn in

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:48.250
kinetic energy.
 

00:34:48.250 --> 00:34:51.719
So an electron falls through 1
volt.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:57.869
The work done is charge of an
electron times 1 volt which is

00:34:57.869 --> 00:35:00.789
1.6 times 10^(-19) joules.
 

00:35:00.789 --> 00:35:03.315
That happens to be called an
electron volt,

00:35:03.315 --> 00:35:05.300
just a convenient thing to use.
 

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:08.856
When the charges that are
pushing around are not coulombs

00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:12.730
but this tiny electron it's good
to know in electron volts.

00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:15.903
For example,
in the hydrogen atom the

00:35:15.903 --> 00:35:21.282
coulomb potential is negative
because the charge at the origin

00:35:21.282 --> 00:35:26.661
is a proton q (electron
has got some -q) divided

00:35:26.661 --> 00:35:30.630
by 4Πε
_0r.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:33.170
That's the potential.
 

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:38.338
And in quantum mechanics only
at certain radius you can have

00:35:38.338 --> 00:35:39.389
electrons.
 

00:35:39.389 --> 00:35:42.396
So the lowest electron is
somewhere here,

00:35:42.396 --> 00:35:46.005
and they say it is minus
whatever, some number of

00:35:46.005 --> 00:35:49.690
electrons, 13 point something
electron volts.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:55.021
That means if you want to drag
an electron from this hole and

00:35:55.021 --> 00:36:00.351
liberate it from the atom you've
got to do 13 times 1.6 times

00:36:00.351 --> 00:36:02.840
10^(-19) joules of work.
 

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:06.909
So as if this were 13 volts
down compared to infinity.

00:36:06.909 --> 00:36:13.719
It's a hole in the ground 13
point 4 or 6 volts deep.

00:36:13.719 --> 00:36:17.856
So if you want to liberate that
electron you have to furnish

00:36:17.856 --> 00:36:19.539
that amount of energy.
 

00:36:19.539 --> 00:36:25.643
Okay, now going on with the
visualization let me say--let's

00:36:25.643 --> 00:36:32.590
take another case we can all do,
which is a single point charge.

00:36:32.590 --> 00:36:36.900
Here's a point charge.
 

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:39.280
The electric field due to that
looks like this;

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:49.730
we've done it a million times.
 

00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:54.710
Now, what about the electric
potential?

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:58.539
For a point charge the
potential is 1/r.

00:36:58.539 --> 00:37:03.400
That means it's a constant on a
circle of radius r.

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:05.909
That means if you pick any
circle, or a sphere,

00:37:05.909 --> 00:37:08.860
I'm sorry, V is one
number here,

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.030
V is a different number
there,

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:13.829
a different number there.
 

00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:16.601
So that's the whole surface
surrounding the charge on which

00:37:16.601 --> 00:37:18.130
V is some fixed number.
 

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.530
It depends on that radius.
 

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:22.824
You go further out it's a
different number depending on

00:37:22.824 --> 00:37:25.449
that radius and it falls like
1/r.

00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:30.521
You'll notice once again that
the lines of constant potential

00:37:30.521 --> 00:37:34.409
are perpendicular to the lines
of the field.

00:37:34.409 --> 00:37:36.659
That was true there.
 

00:37:36.659 --> 00:37:38.099
That is true here.
 

00:37:38.099 --> 00:37:40.309
In fact, let me do one more
example.

00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:45.159
If you take a dipole negative
and positive,

00:37:45.159 --> 00:37:54.378
and the field lines go like
this, if you compute the

00:37:54.378 --> 00:37:57.539
potential,
if you go very,

00:37:57.539 --> 00:37:59.775
very close to this guy,
I think you all seem to

00:37:59.775 --> 00:38:02.163
understand if you're very near
one charge forget about the rest

00:38:02.163 --> 00:38:02.780
of the world.
 

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.380
It dominates everything.
 

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.184
Potential would look like
circle centered here,

00:38:07.184 --> 00:38:10.721
but as you go further out the
shape will change and it will

00:38:10.721 --> 00:38:11.880
look like this.
 

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:14.855
A similar thing on the other
side then there will be this

00:38:14.855 --> 00:38:17.724
huge infinite sphere that
becomes plainer that goes all

00:38:17.724 --> 00:38:19.000
the way to infinity.
 

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.449
These are contours of constant
V.

00:38:22.449 --> 00:38:27.168
If you really plot them you'll
again find contours of constant

00:38:27.168 --> 00:38:31.733
V or equipotentials are
perpendicular to the electric

00:38:31.733 --> 00:38:36.768
field lines,
perpendicular to E.

00:38:36.768 --> 00:38:39.804
So I want to explain to you
that this is a very general

00:38:39.804 --> 00:38:40.309
result.
 

00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:44.509
This is not something true in
these isolated cases of nice

00:38:44.509 --> 00:38:45.320
symmetry.
 

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.018
Why is that?
 

00:38:46.018 --> 00:38:48.639
So let's understand why that is
true.

00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:52.253
You remember that the
V_2 -

00:38:52.253 --> 00:38:55.279
V_1 is -
integral of

00:38:55.279 --> 00:38:59.230
E⋅dr
from 1 to 2.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.684
So let's say
V_2 and

00:39:01.684 --> 00:39:04.889
V_1,
2 and 1 are very close.

00:39:04.889 --> 00:39:08.920
In that case let's call it
delta V = -E

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.860
⋅dr.
 

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:13.400
There's no integral to do
because I've picked two points

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.079
which are near by an infinite
decimal amount dr,

00:39:16.079 --> 00:39:18.311
so
E⋅dr

00:39:18.311 --> 00:39:21.451
is equal to delta V which
is a minus of

00:39:21.451 --> 00:39:24.800
V_2 -
V_1.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:27.010
What does that mean?
 

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.449
That means if you start at some
point,

00:39:30.449 --> 00:39:33.001
and you move a distance
dr, you take a step

00:39:33.001 --> 00:39:35.342
dr,
and you find the change in

00:39:35.342 --> 00:39:37.534
potential,
the answer depends not only on

00:39:37.534 --> 00:39:41.630
the length of your step,
but on which direction you move.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:45.181
Because of this dot product the
change in potential will be the

00:39:45.181 --> 00:39:47.989
magnitude of the electric field
at that point,

00:39:47.989 --> 00:39:53.389
the magnitude of the step
length and the cosine of the

00:39:53.389 --> 00:39:55.530
angle between them.
 

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:58.882
So if the electric potential is
replaced by height in two

00:39:58.882 --> 00:40:01.791
dimensions,
you know, top of Sleeping Giant

00:40:01.791 --> 00:40:04.199
and the hill is going up and
down,

00:40:04.199 --> 00:40:06.550
up and down,
you're at some point.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.440
There's a height function
h of x and y

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.260
instead of V of
x and y,

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:12.530
and I want to take one-step,
and I can ask,

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.139
"What are the consequences
to my height?"

00:40:15.139 --> 00:40:18.170
The answer is if the electric
field is pointing in some

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:21.146
direction and you take a step
dr in a generally

00:40:21.146 --> 00:40:24.010
different direction this is the
change you get.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.664
So you can ask,
"How do I get the biggest

00:40:26.664 --> 00:40:28.849
drop in height,
or the biggest drop in

00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:30.030
potential?"
 

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:33.059
And cosine theta is 1, right?
 

00:40:33.059 --> 00:40:36.079
Because then there's this,
that times 1 with a minus sign.

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:39.626
So the electric field points in
the direction of the greatest

00:40:39.626 --> 00:40:41.400
rate of change of potential.
 

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.309
It drops in that direction.
 

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:47.670
If you release a marble in the
gravitational field it'll roll

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:50.976
along the gravitational field
which is obtained the same way

00:40:50.976 --> 00:40:53.050
from the gravitational
potential.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.630
If you want to climb up the
mountain,

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:57.237
suppose there's a tsunami
coming and you want to get to

00:40:57.237 --> 00:40:59.914
the top as quickly as possible,
don't panic,

00:40:59.914 --> 00:41:04.309
compute the gradient and move
along the gradient,

00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.929
okay?
 

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:08.416
Then stop, think again,
recompute the gradient and in

00:41:08.416 --> 00:41:12.576
that manner you will get to the
top in quickest time if you can

00:41:12.576 --> 00:41:14.789
compute quickly enough,
okay?

00:41:14.789 --> 00:41:16.070
But that's the process.
 

00:41:16.070 --> 00:41:19.311
At every point there's a vector
pointing in the direction of

00:41:19.311 --> 00:41:20.409
greatest increase.
 

00:41:20.409 --> 00:41:23.739
The electric field happens to
be the direction of greatest

00:41:23.739 --> 00:41:27.010
decrease because of this minus
sign in our convention.

00:41:27.010 --> 00:41:30.378
Now, let's us say you're on
this mountain and you don't want

00:41:30.378 --> 00:41:33.806
to go down and you don't want to
go up, but you still want to

00:41:33.806 --> 00:41:34.719
take a walk.
 

00:41:34.719 --> 00:41:37.019
Can you do that?
 

00:41:37.019 --> 00:41:39.699
Yes?
 

00:41:39.699 --> 00:41:43.730
Or are you stuck at one place?
 

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:45.130
What do you have to do guys?
 

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:46.469
Yes?
 

00:41:46.469 --> 00:41:47.360
Student:  You move
perpendicular to the gradient.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:50.730
Prof: You move
perpendicular to the field.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:54.789
To move perpendicular to the
field the cause theta is 0.

00:41:54.789 --> 00:41:57.789
That's why, now going back to
this, this is called Mt.

00:41:57.789 --> 00:42:01.822
Coulomb, it's coming out of the
blackboard really tall and you

00:42:01.822 --> 00:42:02.550
are here.
 

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:05.530
If you want to go downhill you
go along the field.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:08.940
You run away from the hill all
the way to the valley,

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.989
to the plains.
 

00:42:09.989 --> 00:42:13.250
If you want to go to the top
you go opposite of the field,

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.092
but if you go along this
equipotential at every point you

00:42:17.092 --> 00:42:21.280
do not do any extra work so your
potential does not change.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:25.559
So it's clear from this that
the equal potential is always--

00:42:25.559 --> 00:42:30.773
in fact in general the change
in any potential is gradient of

00:42:30.773 --> 00:42:32.860
the potential dot dr.
 

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.889
Except for the minus sign it's
the same story that if

00:42:35.889 --> 00:42:40.713
dr is parallel to grad
V or anti-parallel to

00:42:40.713 --> 00:42:44.860
E you get the biggest
change in voltage.

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:51.860
All right, so this is what you
should understand in general.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:54.132
What is good about the
potential is you can take a

00:42:54.132 --> 00:42:55.989
whole bunch of charges put them
here,

00:42:55.989 --> 00:42:58.443
there, there,
there, and you can draw little

00:42:58.443 --> 00:43:00.320
contours,
maybe of constant V.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.500
It's just like the graph you
have of the weather,

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.335
of the temperature,
for example,

00:43:05.335 --> 00:43:08.713
or if you have a topographic
map of the mountain there are

00:43:08.713 --> 00:43:11.101
some valleys,
and there are plains,

00:43:11.101 --> 00:43:13.239
and there are some
mountaintops,

00:43:13.239 --> 00:43:16.833
and these lines of constant
height are like constant

00:43:16.833 --> 00:43:19.179
V,
so it helps you visualize.

00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:22.237
And then if you're told you
release something here and it

00:43:22.237 --> 00:43:25.405
rolled down and came here you
can find the speed here given

00:43:25.405 --> 00:43:27.590
the difference of these two
numbers.

00:43:27.590 --> 00:43:30.000
You don't have to go through
the intermediate step.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.309
So these are the advantages.
 

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:37.498
Okay, now I'm going to return
to the conductors briefly to

00:43:37.498 --> 00:43:39.409
tell you something.
 

00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:42.730
One other thing that is new
compared to what we did before.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:45.130
Remember what I told you about
a conductor?

00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:49.985
A conductor is one in which the
electrons do not belong to any

00:43:49.985 --> 00:43:51.018
one parent.
 

00:43:51.018 --> 00:43:54.431
They run around to the whole
sample, but they cannot leave

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:55.150
the metal.
 

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:57.273
At the boundary of the metal
there are forces bringing them

00:43:57.273 --> 00:43:57.530
back.
 

00:43:57.530 --> 00:43:59.570
Inside they are free to move.
 

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.945
Therefore, if you take a
conductor and you stick it into

00:44:02.945 --> 00:44:06.260
a field initially the electric
field will penetrate the

00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:07.119
conductor.
 

00:44:07.119 --> 00:44:09.094
The charges,
because they are free to move,

00:44:09.094 --> 00:44:09.659
will move.
 

00:44:09.659 --> 00:44:11.050
The negatives charges will move
one way,

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:14.722
positive charges will move the
other way until they set up a

00:44:14.722 --> 00:44:18.023
back reaction to this that
blocks the field inside the

00:44:18.023 --> 00:44:20.389
metal until the field inside is
0.

00:44:20.389 --> 00:44:23.429
So here's a generic conductor.
 

00:44:23.429 --> 00:44:29.161
If you put it in an external
field it will have some charges

00:44:29.161 --> 00:44:33.197
on its surface,
will produce a field this way

00:44:33.197 --> 00:44:37.931
that will oppose the external
field in which you put it until

00:44:37.931 --> 00:44:41.719
at the end there's no field
inside the metal.

00:44:41.719 --> 00:44:44.530
Or, if you did not put it in
the field and just took this

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:46.590
material and dumped some charge
on it,

00:44:46.590 --> 00:44:49.869
threw some charge on it and
asked where does it go,

00:44:49.869 --> 00:44:53.429
well, the charges are all plus
and they don't like each other.

00:44:53.429 --> 00:44:56.704
They want to move away from
each other, and they move as far

00:44:56.704 --> 00:45:00.090
as they can until they come to
the boundary and they cannot go

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:00.980
any further.
 

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:03.219
That's where they stop.
 

00:45:03.219 --> 00:45:06.152
That we saw before,
so we know all the charges in

00:45:06.152 --> 00:45:08.110
the metal are in the boundary.
 

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:11.159
There is no electric field
inside because of Gauss's Law.

00:45:11.159 --> 00:45:14.413
If I want to find the charge
here I do a tiny sphere and do

00:45:14.413 --> 00:45:16.768
integral
E⋅da.

00:45:16.768 --> 00:45:19.320
I get 0, and that's the charge
inside.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:21.750
And I can move this little
microscope all over the inside.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.250
I keep getting zero.
 

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.219
That's why I know there's no
charge inside.

00:45:26.219 --> 00:45:27.500
There's no charge inside.
 

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.750
There is no field inside.
 

00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:33.960
Q = 0 inside metal.
 

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:41.730
This is a solid metal,
and E = 0 inside solid.

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:48.476
The other variation you can
have is suppose they make a hole

00:45:48.476 --> 00:45:49.619
in this.
 

00:45:49.619 --> 00:45:52.606
There is no electric field
anywhere here because it's a

00:45:52.606 --> 00:45:53.050
metal.
 

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.822
The whole logic is if you've
got a field you're not in a

00:45:55.822 --> 00:45:56.780
static situation.
 

00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.010
Let the charges move.
 

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:00.320
They'll keep moving until they
have no reason to move.

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:03.090
That reason will stop when the
field vanishes.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:03.650
It's quite amazing.
 

00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:06.844
They can always find an
arrangement in which they kill

00:46:06.844 --> 00:46:08.110
the external field.
 

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:09.159
That's the perfect metal.
 

00:46:09.159 --> 00:46:10.699
So there's no field here.
 

00:46:10.699 --> 00:46:16.590
So if you do a Gaussian surface
like this the charge inside that

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.556
is 0,
but that does not preclude the

00:46:19.556 --> 00:46:24.289
possibility that there are maybe
some plus charges there and some

00:46:24.289 --> 00:46:25.989
minus charges there.
 

00:46:25.989 --> 00:46:31.246
Last time I told you that if
that happens then the pluses and

00:46:31.246 --> 00:46:36.327
minuses will run around and meet
and destroy each other and

00:46:36.327 --> 00:46:39.041
neutralize,
but that's a little subtle

00:46:39.041 --> 00:46:42.068
because maybe if they were the
only two things in the world I

00:46:42.068 --> 00:46:44.927
can understand that,
but there's also these charges

00:46:44.927 --> 00:46:47.289
outside maybe that'll impede
their motion.

00:46:47.289 --> 00:46:50.123
But here's one way to prove
that there can be really no

00:46:50.123 --> 00:46:51.960
charge even on the inner
surface.

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:54.688
If there were some plus charges
here and minus charges

00:46:54.688 --> 00:46:57.574
there--remember Q is 0
inside so you can only have

00:46:57.574 --> 00:46:58.449
equal number.
 

00:46:58.449 --> 00:47:02.081
Then electric field lines will
have to leave the plus charge

00:47:02.081 --> 00:47:04.360
and terminate on the minus
charge,

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.360
so there'll be an electric
field inside the cavity,

00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:10.896
and I'm saying that's not
allowed because of the

00:47:10.896 --> 00:47:11.800
following.
 

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.639
If there is a field inside the
cavity let's take that path and

00:47:15.639 --> 00:47:19.289
another path which are two ways
to go from here to here.

00:47:19.289 --> 00:47:22.240
On one path I get a line
integral of E to be not

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:22.460
0.
 

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.608
Second one I get line integral
equal to 0 because there is no

00:47:25.608 --> 00:47:28.860
E, but the line integral
cannot vary with the path in an

00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.329
electrostatic situation.
 

00:47:30.329 --> 00:47:34.514
Therefore, there cannot be any
electric field inside the cavity

00:47:34.514 --> 00:47:36.809
due to anything you put outside.
 

00:47:36.809 --> 00:47:41.186
You can have an electric field
inside the cavity if you go into

00:47:41.186 --> 00:47:44.929
the cavity and put by hand some
extra charge there.

00:47:44.929 --> 00:47:48.228
Then what will happen is that
guy will produce a field and the

00:47:48.228 --> 00:47:51.364
field lines will come to the
boundary and terminate on some

00:47:51.364 --> 00:47:52.500
negative charges.
 

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:54.860
Again, there'll be no field
here.

00:47:54.860 --> 00:48:02.744
But a hollow cavity with no
charges inside the hole will not

00:48:02.744 --> 00:48:07.289
have charges on the edge either.
 

00:48:07.289 --> 00:48:09.849
So now, what else can we say
about conductors?

00:48:09.849 --> 00:48:13.431
Today I used the fact that the
line integral of E is 0

00:48:13.431 --> 00:48:16.655
to tell you that in a hollow
cavity you cannot have any

00:48:16.655 --> 00:48:18.090
charges in the wall.
 

00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:27.320
Second thing is every conductor
is an equipotential.

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:33.309
It's an equipotential.
 

00:48:33.309 --> 00:48:33.940
Why is that?
 

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:39.637
Can you tell me why that is
true if it is not equipotential,

00:48:39.637 --> 00:48:41.280
the whole lump?
 

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.900
Yep?
 

00:48:42.900 --> 00:48:44.635
Student:  If it wasn't
equal potential then there would

00:48:44.635 --> 00:48:45.659
be an electric field inside
there.

00:48:45.659 --> 00:48:46.989
Prof: And how do we know
that?

00:48:46.989 --> 00:48:49.275
Student:  Because
there's a potential difference

00:48:49.275 --> 00:48:50.079
________________.
 

00:48:50.079 --> 00:48:51.510
Prof: That's right.
 

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:53.239
In other words,
if you take the gradient,

00:48:53.239 --> 00:48:55.226
namely taking derivatives,
you'll get a non-zero

00:48:55.226 --> 00:48:57.849
derivative because I'm telling
you V is not constant.

00:48:57.849 --> 00:48:59.590
In some direction it's got to
change.

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:01.525
There's an electric field in
that direction,

00:49:01.525 --> 00:49:03.099
at least, but that's not
allowed.

00:49:03.099 --> 00:49:06.250
So V is a constant,
so take any metal shaped like

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:06.880
anything.
 

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:12.217
You can associate a single
potential to all of it,

00:49:12.217 --> 00:49:12.980
okay?
 

00:49:12.980 --> 00:49:15.000
If it's got charge on it that's
the same,

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.335
and what it means if you start
at infinity the work done to

00:49:18.335 --> 00:49:20.853
come there,
the work done to come there,

00:49:20.853 --> 00:49:24.706
the work done to come there are
all the same because they're all

00:49:24.706 --> 00:49:26.360
measuring the potential.
 

00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.360
The whole metal is at one
potential.

00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:31.510
That allows you to do certain
tricks.

00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:33.679
So here's one trick you do.
 

00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:36.440
There are more tricks,
but this is the only one we can

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.690
discuss in this class.
 

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:41.353
So here's an infinite
conducting plane,

00:49:41.353 --> 00:49:45.210
a sort of ground,
attached to the ground,

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:48.969
and over this guy I put a
charge q.

00:49:48.969 --> 00:49:52.858
And I ask you,
"Find the electric field

00:49:52.858 --> 00:49:54.940
everywhere now."
 

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:58.349
That's your challenge.
 

00:49:58.349 --> 00:50:01.985
Without this guy fields are
just radial, so radial,

00:50:01.985 --> 00:50:05.911
radial, but the fields come
near this metal they cannot

00:50:05.911 --> 00:50:06.929
penetrate.
 

00:50:06.929 --> 00:50:10.329
They've got to stop at the
surface of the metal.

00:50:10.329 --> 00:50:15.090
So the field lines will do that.
 

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:17.925
They will all terminate on the
metal, and to terminate you need

00:50:17.925 --> 00:50:20.485
some negative charge which the
metal will suck out of the

00:50:20.485 --> 00:50:20.989
ground.
 

00:50:20.989 --> 00:50:24.710
That's the reason for grounding
it.

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:30.280
So the question is what kind of
charge distribution do you get

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.650
on the metal?
 

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:34.530
How much charge is there on the
metal?

00:50:34.530 --> 00:50:37.931
And because there are positive
charge and negative charge here

00:50:37.931 --> 00:50:41.112
what's the force of attraction
between this charge and the

00:50:41.112 --> 00:50:41.670
plane?
 

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:44.559
In general that's a very
difficult problem.

00:50:44.559 --> 00:50:47.119
If I gave you a potato,
aluminum potato,

00:50:47.119 --> 00:50:50.074
put a charge next to it,
it will have a force,

00:50:50.074 --> 00:50:52.570
but it's not easy to calculate
it.

00:50:52.570 --> 00:50:57.480
But this infinite sheet turns
out very easy to calculate.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:02.436
The reason is that we can solve
this problem by borrowing from

00:51:02.436 --> 00:51:03.900
another problem.
 

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:06.389
The problem I borrow from is
the following.

00:51:06.389 --> 00:51:08.280
Forget this plane.
 

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:12.992
Continue these lines,
and think of the problem of a

00:51:12.992 --> 00:51:17.139
dipole with an equal negative
charge here.

00:51:17.139 --> 00:51:20.860
So the lines from them go like
this, right?

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:23.869
And if you slice it in the
perpendicular bisector of this

00:51:23.869 --> 00:51:27.309
distance between them you will
hit every line perpendicularly.

00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:29.880
You guys remember that part
about the dipole field at

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.768
somewhere there?
 

00:51:30.768 --> 00:51:33.719
You cut it right down the
middle.

00:51:33.719 --> 00:51:43.349
So this plane was an
equipotential at V = 0.

00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:45.940
If it's an equipotential there
is nothing there.

00:51:45.940 --> 00:51:48.831
It was just a mathematical
surface on which V was

00:51:48.831 --> 00:51:50.199
constant and equal to 0.
 

00:51:50.199 --> 00:51:53.806
If V is constant you can
slide in a conductor there and

00:51:53.806 --> 00:51:56.460
nobody will know,
because the field is 0 along

00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:01.550
the surface of the conductor,
nothing happens.

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:04.510
So you can reconcile the fact
that conductors are

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:07.226
equipotentials,
and solve problems in which a

00:52:07.226 --> 00:52:10.273
charge is in front of a
conductor if you're lucky enough

00:52:10.273 --> 00:52:13.487
to find the situation where
that's an equipotential surface

00:52:13.487 --> 00:52:16.644
of the same shape as your
conductor then you can slip your

00:52:16.644 --> 00:52:17.920
conductor there.
 

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.445
So in this example what happens
is that the electric field here

00:52:22.445 --> 00:52:26.681
throughout the plane is exactly
what you would get due to a

00:52:26.681 --> 00:52:28.579
dipole minus and plus.
 

00:52:28.579 --> 00:52:33.000
That you can easily calculate
at all points on the plane.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.815
And once you've got the
electric field you remember

00:52:35.815 --> 00:52:38.630
σ/ε
_0 is the

00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:41.110
electric field so you can find
σ,

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:44.840
the charge density.
 

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:48.731
And if you integrate the charge
density you will get exactly

00:52:48.731 --> 00:52:51.362
-q,
because the number of lines

00:52:51.362 --> 00:52:54.846
coming from here have to
terminate on the plane rather

00:52:54.846 --> 00:52:57.539
than on this and that'll be
-q.

00:52:57.539 --> 00:53:00.365
And finally,
what's the force of attraction

00:53:00.365 --> 00:53:02.789
between the plane and this
charge?

00:53:02.789 --> 00:53:08.719
Can you make a guess?
 

00:53:08.719 --> 00:53:13.070
What's the force with which the
plane attracts the charge?

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:16.489
I'm asking you to guess,
so it cannot be too difficult.

00:53:16.489 --> 00:53:19.313
Students:
 Same as that of the other

00:53:19.313 --> 00:53:19.920
charge?
 

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:23.226
Prof: Same as the force
that this negative charge would

00:53:23.226 --> 00:53:26.210
exert on this positive charge,
and I'll tell you why.

00:53:26.210 --> 00:53:30.500
This guy is looking around,
okay, seeing some forces.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.833
It's due to these negative
charges on the plane,

00:53:34.833 --> 00:53:40.090
but they're identical to the
field created by this guy.

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:43.389
So it cannot tell the
difference and therefore if

00:53:43.389 --> 00:53:47.581
you're releasing it it'll move
the same way in this problem as

00:53:47.581 --> 00:53:49.300
in the other problem.
 

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:53.782
So it'll be drawn to the plate
with an attractive force which

00:53:53.782 --> 00:53:57.668
is q times -q
divided by square of that

00:53:57.668 --> 00:53:58.639
distance.
 

00:53:58.639 --> 00:54:02.768
So the summary of what I did
now is that if you solve any

00:54:02.768 --> 00:54:07.489
problem, let's say the dipole
problem, and you get some shape.

00:54:07.489 --> 00:54:10.010
It's an equipotential.
 

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:13.146
You're allowed to,
then, replace that with a chunk

00:54:13.146 --> 00:54:16.985
of aluminum and keep the field
lines the way they are because

00:54:16.985 --> 00:54:20.507
that aluminum will be an
equipotential and it'll happily

00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:24.027
sit on equipotentials because
there are no forces on the

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:27.420
surfaces of the conductor moving
the charges.

00:54:27.420 --> 00:54:31.152
So the moral of the story is
you can sneak in a solid object

00:54:31.152 --> 00:54:35.139
bounded by the surface of an
equal potential for any problem.

00:54:35.139 --> 00:54:37.519
So if you can solve certain
problems and the equal

00:54:37.519 --> 00:54:40.581
potentials have nice shapes you
can put conductors of that shape

00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:41.989
in that precise location.
 

00:54:41.989 --> 00:54:44.764
That'll answer a different
problem in which the second

00:54:44.764 --> 00:54:45.760
charge is absent.
 

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.210
You only have the first charge.
 

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:50.639
It's like a phantom charge,
an image charge.

00:54:50.639 --> 00:54:54.514
So it's like this charge looks
into the mirror and sees the

00:54:54.514 --> 00:54:55.050
image.
 

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:58.369
The image is minus of itself
and it's drawn to it,

00:54:58.369 --> 00:55:03.047
because the field produced by
this guy and this guy is the

00:55:03.047 --> 00:55:07.480
same as the field produced by
all of these and this.

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:19.110
All right, so now we've got a
final problem with energetics.

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:23.780
The question is I want to bring
a whole bunch of charges,

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.539
q_1,
q_2,

00:55:25.539 --> 00:55:30.612
q_3 from
infinity and bring them to this

00:55:30.612 --> 00:55:31.880
arrangement.
 

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.063
So when they're infinitely far
they don't even know about each

00:55:34.063 --> 00:55:34.349
other.
 

00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:36.309
They don't feel any force.
 

00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:37.460
So here is my goal.
 

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:40.360
I've got to do some work,
bring everybody together.

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:41.800
They may all be positive.
 

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:44.233
They may not want to be in the
same region, but I'm going to

00:55:44.233 --> 00:55:44.768
force them.
 

00:55:44.768 --> 00:55:47.809
The question is,
"What work do I have to

00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:48.570
do?"
 

00:55:48.570 --> 00:55:50.300
We're going to calculate that.
 

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:53.940
We do that by saying first
let's take charge 1.

00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:56.969
Let it be wherever it has to be.
 

00:55:56.969 --> 00:56:02.949
Then I bring charge 2 from
infinity and put it here.

00:56:02.949 --> 00:56:07.188
The work done for that is by
definition q_2

00:56:07.188 --> 00:56:10.239
times the potential here,
potential there is

00:56:10.239 --> 00:56:12.436
q_1
/4Πε

00:56:12.436 --> 00:56:17.101
_0r_12,
r_12  is the

00:56:17.101 --> 00:56:19.469
distance between 1 and 2.
 

00:56:19.469 --> 00:56:20.809
Now I nail the two charges.
 

00:56:20.809 --> 00:56:23.380
Nobody is allowed to move so I
don't do further work.

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:29.867
Then I bring a third charge
from infinity to its location

00:56:29.867 --> 00:56:30.679
here.
 

00:56:30.679 --> 00:56:32.969
How much work should I do?
 

00:56:32.969 --> 00:56:37.157
The work that I have to do is
the potential energy from

00:56:37.157 --> 00:56:40.570
infinity to here due to these
two charges.

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:44.768
So that means the work I'll
have to do is equal to

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:47.768
q_1q
_3/4

00:56:47.768 --> 00:56:51.710

_0r_13

_0r_23.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:01.150
You follow that?
 

00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:02.320
That's the work that I have to
do.

00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.032
The first guy,
q_2,

00:57:05.032 --> 00:57:07.280
had to fight only this one.
 

00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:09.710
The third guy has to fight
these two, and the fourth guy

00:57:09.710 --> 00:57:11.610
will have to fight these three
and so on.

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:15.980
I'm just going up to three
charges.

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:18.657
From this it should not be too
hard to guess in general if

00:57:18.657 --> 00:57:21.561
you've got many,
many charges you do

00:57:21.561 --> 00:57:26.224
q_iq
_j/4Πε

00:57:26.224 --> 00:57:33.110
_0r_ij
where i goes from 1 to--

00:57:33.110 --> 00:57:36.914
let's see, from 1 to n,
where j goes from 1 to

00:57:36.914 --> 00:57:41.867
n,
but i cannot be equal to

00:57:41.867 --> 00:57:45.909
j and you divide by 2.
 

00:57:45.909 --> 00:57:50.211
So if you're not able to read
this I'll tell you the summation

00:57:50.211 --> 00:57:53.114
is 1 over 2,
i from 1 to n,

00:57:53.114 --> 00:57:56.639
j from 1 to n,
but with the condition that

00:57:56.639 --> 00:57:59.969
i should not be equal to
j times all these.

00:57:59.969 --> 00:58:01.769
You can see that's valid here.
 

00:58:01.769 --> 00:58:02.659
Yep?
 

00:58:02.659 --> 00:58:04.030
Student:  V or
U?

00:58:04.030 --> 00:58:06.219
Prof: This is the--oh,
I'm sorry.

00:58:06.219 --> 00:58:07.719
You're absolutely right.
 

00:58:07.719 --> 00:58:09.190
This is not the potential.
 

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:10.710
It's the potential energy.
 

00:58:10.710 --> 00:58:13.170
It should be called U.
 

00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:15.590
Did I say--yeah, that's right.
 

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:16.987
Because
q/4Πε

00:58:16.987 --> 00:58:19.150
_0 is the
potential, but I multiply by

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:20.210
q_2.
 

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:25.057
That is actually an energy,
so these are all energies

00:58:25.057 --> 00:58:27.110
denoted by U.
 

00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:30.773
Now, if you have a continuous
set of charges you must replace

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.239
a sum by the integral.
 

00:58:32.239 --> 00:58:35.429
Do you see what's going on here
why there's a half?

00:58:35.429 --> 00:58:36.882
Because this one counts
q_1q

00:58:36.882 --> 00:58:38.387
_3,
then again it counts

00:58:38.387 --> 00:58:39.829
q_3q
_1,

00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:42.144
but there's only one such thing
so I divided it by 2 and I have

00:58:42.144 --> 00:58:44.050
nothing like q_1q
_1,

00:58:44.050 --> 00:58:46.710
so you don't allow that.
 

00:58:46.710 --> 00:58:51.190
That's the energy to assemble a
whole bunch of charges together.

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:52.349
So that's the work you do.
 

00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:55.998
If you do that work and you
take your hands off it'll fly

00:58:55.998 --> 00:58:59.713
apart and give you back that
energy in the form of kinetic

00:58:59.713 --> 00:59:00.429
energy.
 

00:59:00.429 --> 00:59:02.239
Now, let me do another simple
example.

00:59:02.239 --> 00:59:05.532
I want to take a sphere of
radius r,

00:59:05.532 --> 00:59:08.748
and I want to put q
coulombs on it,

00:59:08.748 --> 00:59:13.690
and I want to know how much
work I have to do for that one.

00:59:13.690 --> 00:59:17.965
What work do I have to do to
charge this sphere with q

00:59:17.965 --> 00:59:18.750
coulombs?
 

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:23.405
Well, first couple of coulombs
come in they don't run into

00:59:23.405 --> 00:59:26.510
anything, so I put some charge
here.

00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:29.465
That makes it harder to bring
the next set of coulombs and the

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:30.579
next set of coulombs.
 

00:59:30.579 --> 00:59:34.054
At some intermediate stage,
when the charge on this sphere

00:59:34.054 --> 00:59:37.286
is q and I want to bring
in a charge dq,

00:59:37.286 --> 00:59:39.360
how much work do I have to do?
 

00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:43.920
When the charge is q the
potential of the surface of the

00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:46.494
sphere is
q/4Πε

00:59:46.494 --> 00:59:49.070
_0 over R.
 

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:52.226
The whole sphere is at that
potential and I'm trying to

00:59:52.226 --> 00:59:55.733
bring in a tiny more dq
from all sides and smear it on

00:59:55.733 --> 00:59:56.260
this.
 

00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.650
The work for that will be that
times dq.

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:06.226
Then the total work I do when I
go all the way from 0 to capital

01:00:06.226 --> 01:00:09.590
Q will be a
Q^(2)/2 times

01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:13.309
1/4Πε
_0R.

01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:20.690
Sorry, capital R.
 

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:24.110
Again, you see why you get the
half because the last coulomb is

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:26.429
much harder to bring than the
first one.

01:00:26.429 --> 01:00:27.230
The first one is free.
 

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:28.389
It's like a spring.
 

01:00:28.389 --> 01:00:31.989
When you pull it the first
inches are easier.

01:00:31.989 --> 01:00:34.764
The other ones are harder
because the force is kx,

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.141
so the work done is the
integral of x that

01:00:37.141 --> 01:00:38.480
becomes x^(2)/2.
 

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:41.697
Similarly to bring in an extra
charge you've got to worry about

01:00:41.697 --> 01:00:44.916
how much charge is already there
on this sphere that's opposing

01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:46.369
you with this potential.
 

01:00:46.369 --> 01:00:49.998
You work against that by
bringing dq from infinity

01:00:49.998 --> 01:00:52.980
and you integrate it you get
q^(2)/2.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:57.398
So this is a good problem to
explain the difference between

01:00:57.398 --> 01:00:59.150
potential and energy.
 

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:03.432
This is the potential and this
is the charge I brought from

01:01:03.432 --> 01:01:07.215
infinity,
and that together is the

01:01:07.215 --> 01:01:14.699
du and integral of the
dU is my total u.

01:01:14.699 --> 01:01:17.076
So one can ask,
"What's the energy to

01:01:17.076 --> 01:01:19.394
produce any arrangement of
charges,"

01:01:19.394 --> 01:01:22.409
and you should be able to
either do the sum or do the

01:01:22.409 --> 01:01:23.280
integral.
 

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.981
One homework problem will be
how to assemble a solid ball of

01:01:27.981 --> 01:01:30.768
charge, not a sphere,
solid ball.

01:01:30.768 --> 01:01:34.612
It's got no radius and slowly
it grows up to some size and you

01:01:34.612 --> 01:01:38.079
can do similar integrals where
you slap on more and more

01:01:38.079 --> 01:01:41.230
spherical shells on this onion
to build it up.

01:01:41.230 --> 01:01:44.601
Again, if you knew the
potential at any stage you can

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:48.429
find the work to add a thin
layer to it and integrate it.

01:01:48.429 --> 01:01:56.510
Okay, so final topic is one of
capacitors.

01:01:56.510 --> 01:02:02.304
So a capacitor is like a way of
storing charge and storing

01:02:02.304 --> 01:02:03.219
energy.
 

01:02:03.219 --> 01:02:04.960
In other words,
if I want to store

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.389
gravitational energy I can do
the following.

01:02:07.389 --> 01:02:11.074
I build this tank,
and maybe there's some water in

01:02:11.074 --> 01:02:14.159
the lake here at the foot of the
tank,

01:02:14.159 --> 01:02:17.492
and I go to the top,
and go to the top and empty

01:02:17.492 --> 01:02:21.820
little buckets until I've got
some water at the big height.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:26.110
Then I've done some work and
it'll pay me back when I open

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:28.820
the tap and let it all rush
down,

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:33.708
and it may turn a turbine blade
and give me back thermo electric

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:34.329
power.
 

01:02:34.329 --> 01:02:36.800
You want to do similar things
electrically.

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.179
You want to invest with some
work and it'll give you back.

01:02:40.179 --> 01:02:43.583
So one thing I can do is I can
take a plus and minus charge

01:02:43.583 --> 01:02:46.869
which love to be next to each
other and separate them.

01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:50.552
Now, I've done some work,
but I cannot walk around like

01:02:50.552 --> 01:02:51.030
this.
 

01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:52.590
I've got other things to do.
 

01:02:52.590 --> 01:02:55.300
I've got to find a better way
to store energy.

01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.840
How do you shake hands with
people?

01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.519
So you have to find another way.
 

01:02:58.519 --> 01:02:59.809
So here's what you do.
 

01:02:59.809 --> 01:03:03.952
You take one conductor and you
take another conductor,

01:03:03.952 --> 01:03:07.079
any shape you like,
it doesn't matter.

01:03:07.079 --> 01:03:09.909
They are both electrically
neutral, but they're conductors.

01:03:09.909 --> 01:03:14.820
So you take a tiny charge from
this guy and put it there.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:18.949
Then take more and more charge
and start putting it there.

01:03:18.949 --> 01:03:21.387
At any stage,
when you stop,

01:03:21.387 --> 01:03:26.985
you will have a lot of positive
charges on this conductor and a

01:03:26.985 --> 01:03:31.139
lot of negative charges on this
conductor.

01:03:31.139 --> 01:03:34.164
This conductor will be at one
potential because it's a

01:03:34.164 --> 01:03:34.849
conductor.
 

01:03:34.849 --> 01:03:37.251
That conductor will be at
another potential because it's a

01:03:37.251 --> 01:03:39.150
conductor, but both have unique
potentials.

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:42.045
They are not the same,
but this whole conductor has

01:03:42.045 --> 01:03:44.418
one potential,
this has another potential,

01:03:44.418 --> 01:03:45.230
V'.
 

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:47.539
And because it's harder and
harder to pump the coulombs you

01:03:47.539 --> 01:03:49.731
can imagine that there is a
potential difference between

01:03:49.731 --> 01:03:52.027
them,
because you've got to go uphill

01:03:52.027 --> 01:03:55.639
to pump even more charge into
this already charged object.

01:03:55.639 --> 01:03:59.253
So we define the capacitance as
the charge that you transferred

01:03:59.253 --> 01:04:01.820
divided by the voltage
difference you got.

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:04.030
So let me call this 0 by
convention.

01:04:04.030 --> 01:04:08.969
That is called the capacitance.
 

01:04:08.969 --> 01:04:12.460
That's the ability of that
system to hold charge.

01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.326
If they're very,
very tiny metal spheres there's

01:04:14.326 --> 01:04:15.199
some amount of work.
 

01:04:15.199 --> 01:04:19.418
If they're huge metal spheres
you can transfer a lot of

01:04:19.418 --> 01:04:20.590
charge, okay?
 

01:04:20.590 --> 01:04:21.550
That's the definition.
 

01:04:21.550 --> 01:04:24.349
It's measured in farads.
 

01:04:24.349 --> 01:04:26.835
Again, it's got some units
coulomb for volt,

01:04:26.835 --> 01:04:30.304
but again it's got a different
name, named after Mr. Faraday,

01:04:30.304 --> 01:04:31.750
measured in farads.
 

01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:34.969
Usually you will have
microfarads in a lab.

01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:38.199
Farad is a huge unit.
 

01:04:38.199 --> 01:04:42.869
So let's find the capacitance
of certain simple arrangements.

01:04:42.869 --> 01:04:47.570
Simplest arrangement is the
parallel plate capacitor.

01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:48.440
Here it is.
 

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.710
There's one plate.
 

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:52.829
Here's a second plate.
 

01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:54.969
The area of the plate is
A.

01:04:54.969 --> 01:04:57.829
The distance between them is
d.

01:04:57.829 --> 01:05:02.985
And I put plus charges on this
one and I got them from this

01:05:02.985 --> 01:05:03.519
one.
 

01:05:03.519 --> 01:05:04.349
Do you understand that?
 

01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:06.650
You don't have to bring your
own charge.

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:10.371
You remove charge from one
conductor you therefore leave it

01:05:10.371 --> 01:05:13.965
negatively charged and you dump
it on the other conductor

01:05:13.965 --> 01:05:16.659
thereby leaving it positively
charged.

01:05:16.659 --> 01:05:18.900
So you don't need to bring
charge from the outside world.

01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:21.472
You just redistribute the
neutrality so that one is now

01:05:21.472 --> 01:05:22.949
negative and one is positive.
 

01:05:22.949 --> 01:05:26.181
So Q stands for the
magnitude of charge that you

01:05:26.181 --> 01:05:27.018
transferred.
 

01:05:27.018 --> 01:05:29.570
So suppose I transfer some
charge Q.

01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:34.655
My job is to find Q
divided by V and that's

01:05:34.655 --> 01:05:36.199
my capacitance.
 

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:39.041
Okay, so how am I going to find
the voltage difference between

01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:39.599
these two?
 

01:05:39.599 --> 01:05:42.913
I think you guys should know by
now voltage difference is the

01:05:42.913 --> 01:05:45.949
electric field times the
distance between the plates.

01:05:45.949 --> 01:05:47.730
There's no line integral.
 

01:05:47.730 --> 01:05:51.159
E⋅dr
is just E times d.

01:05:51.159 --> 01:05:55.327
E, if you remember,
is

01:05:55.327 --> 01:06:02.469
σ/ε_0
between the plates,

01:06:02.469 --> 01:06:07.679
and sigma is Q/A.
 

01:06:07.679 --> 01:06:10.690
Charge density is the total
charge over that.

01:06:10.690 --> 01:06:16.599
And that is by definition
Q over C,

01:06:16.599 --> 01:06:24.463
therefore the capacitance of
this parallel plate capacitor is

01:06:24.463 --> 01:06:29.969
ε_0
A/d.

01:06:29.969 --> 01:06:32.679
So that's one of the easier
calculations to do.

01:06:32.679 --> 01:06:37.628
So anytime someone gives you
two objects and says find for me

01:06:37.628 --> 01:06:41.670
the capacitance you will take
charge from one,

01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:46.130
you will put it on the other
one and then you will--

01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:50.789
hey, where is all these
blackboards?

01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:52.730
Ah, bad choice.
 

01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:55.230
So you guys took all this down?
 

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:56.369
Yes?
 

01:06:56.369 --> 01:06:59.974
Student:  Should that
A be on the bottom for

01:06:59.974 --> 01:07:02.440
the A Q over
________________?

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.710
Prof: Oh, yes.
 

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:09.110
σ is Q/A.
 

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:11.539
Yeah, this is what comes from
knowing the answer.

01:07:11.539 --> 01:07:13.369
This is what you guys do in the
exam.

01:07:13.369 --> 01:07:17.170
When you turn that page then
all kinds of stuff happens.

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:19.295
Signs change,
numbers change and the right

01:07:19.295 --> 01:07:21.059
answer appears on the next page.
 

01:07:21.059 --> 01:07:23.920
That's really what I did
because I knew this formula.

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.860
We're getting there no matter
what, but you're quite right.

01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:29.980
I didn't put the A in
the right place.

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.534
So any way, it's not good to
know the answer every time

01:07:32.534 --> 01:07:34.570
because you're not that alert
doing this.

01:07:34.570 --> 01:07:37.929
Anyway, this is the correct
answer.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:42.329
So here's the capacitance of
this parallel plate.

01:07:42.329 --> 01:07:46.090
Here's another problem you
could do.

01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:46.849
These are also common.
 

01:07:46.849 --> 01:07:51.038
Spherical capacitors are one
sphere of radius a

01:07:51.038 --> 01:07:55.541
surround by second sphere of
radius b and you shove

01:07:55.541 --> 01:08:00.856
charges,
maybe plus on this one and

01:08:00.856 --> 01:08:06.630
equal number of minus on that
one.

01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:08.550
So what's my goal?
 

01:08:08.550 --> 01:08:11.596
Goal is to find the electric
field in the region between

01:08:11.596 --> 01:08:13.621
them,
right, and integrate it from

01:08:13.621 --> 01:08:15.371
here to here,
and to give the potential

01:08:15.371 --> 01:08:17.500
difference,
and divide by the charge.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:21.577
So if I put a charge Q
here you can see that the

01:08:21.577 --> 01:08:25.351
electric field in this region is
just Q over

01:08:25.351 --> 01:08:28.750
4Πε
_0r^(2),

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:33.621
because by Gauss's Law if I
draw a sphere here that encloses

01:08:33.621 --> 01:08:37.515
charge Q,
and it's isotropic and uniform,

01:08:37.515 --> 01:08:40.288
so it's like that of a point
charge.

01:08:40.288 --> 01:08:43.020
Therefore, the potential
difference between these two

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:45.698
points will be like the
potential difference between

01:08:45.698 --> 01:08:48.640
these two points with a point
charge of the origin,

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:54.788
so V_2 -
V_1 will be

01:08:54.788 --> 01:09:00.359
Q/4Πε
_0 times

01:09:00.359 --> 01:09:03.840
[1/a - 1/b].
 

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.479
Well, we are done because this
is what I call V.

01:09:07.479 --> 01:09:12.905
The capacitance is
Q/V and that's

01:09:12.905 --> 01:09:19.512
going to be 4Πε
_0 divided by

01:09:19.512 --> 01:09:23.051
[1/a −
1/b]

01:09:23.051 --> 01:09:29.421
which is 4Πε
_0ab/(b

01:09:29.421 --> 01:09:32.488
− a).
 

01:09:32.488 --> 01:09:35.761
So in every geometry if they
want capacitance move charge

01:09:35.761 --> 01:09:39.545
from one guy to the other guy,
and find the field between

01:09:39.545 --> 01:09:42.899
them, then integrate it to find
the potential.

01:09:42.899 --> 01:09:45.618
The potential will always be
proportional to the charge.

01:09:45.618 --> 01:09:48.618
Take the ratio and that's
capacitance.

01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:50.890
I'm going to put this guy to a
test.

01:09:50.890 --> 01:09:52.868
Let me write down clearly the
answer here.

01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:59.051
4Πε
_0ab/(b

01:09:59.051 --> 01:10:01.800
− a).
 

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:07.105
What test can I do if I want to
compare it to a parallel plate

01:10:07.105 --> 01:10:08.149
capacitor?
 

01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:11.189
Can you see how I can relate it
to parallel plate capacitor?

01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:12.100
Yep?
 

01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.909
Student:  Make the a
close.

01:10:15.909 --> 01:10:16.819
Prof: a what?
 

01:10:16.819 --> 01:10:19.020
Student:  b -
a is close.

01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:21.467
Prof: Right,
you can take b -

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:24.381
a very close,
but it still may not look like

01:10:24.381 --> 01:10:26.189
a parallel plate capacitor.
 

01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:28.109
So here's what I say we do.
 

01:10:28.109 --> 01:10:31.104
Make b and a
astronomical,

01:10:31.104 --> 01:10:33.180
size of the galaxy,
okay?

01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:36.000
And b - a is just
1 inch.

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.340
Then in that case it will
really look like two infinite

01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:38.729
planes.
 

01:10:38.729 --> 01:10:42.143
The fact that it gets wrapped
around over the length of the

01:10:42.143 --> 01:10:45.497
galaxy is just like saying the
earth is round which is not

01:10:45.497 --> 01:10:47.500
obvious from short excursions.
 

01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.377
In that case we can write
4Πε

01:10:50.377 --> 01:10:51.680
_0.
 

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.579
a and b are
really equal to some common

01:10:54.579 --> 01:10:58.037
number R and b -
a is the distance between

01:10:58.037 --> 01:11:00.270
the inner shell and the outer
shell.

01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:03.880
That you can see.
 

01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:05.010
Wait.
 

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:08.984
I'm sorry, 4ΠR^(2) is
the area times

01:11:08.984 --> 01:11:12.695
ε_0
over d,

01:11:12.695 --> 01:11:13.579
right?
 

01:11:13.579 --> 01:11:15.170
So that's one test.
 

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:22.359
It doesn't mean it's right,
but if this test failed it

01:11:22.359 --> 01:11:26.698
means you're definitely wrong.
 

01:11:26.698 --> 01:11:29.893
Okay, now how much energy does
it take to charge up a

01:11:29.893 --> 01:11:30.630
capacitor?
 

01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:32.979
It's what I did earlier,
but let me do it again.

01:11:32.979 --> 01:11:36.460
If you take two plates or any
two surfaces,

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:40.082
and there's a certain amount of
charge q on it and I

01:11:40.082 --> 01:11:42.828
transfer delta q the work
I do is,

01:11:42.828 --> 01:11:48.260
the delta q times the
voltage at that stage.

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:52.783
Voltage at that stage is equal
to q/C,

01:11:52.783 --> 01:11:57.220
which is the q you have
up to that point.

01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:06.466
Therefore, the total work you
do is

01:12:06.466 --> 01:12:15.170
½q^(2)/C.
 

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:18.492
So when you want to charge a
capacitor with a charge q

01:12:18.492 --> 01:12:21.814
on it either you can write it
that way or you can also do the

01:12:21.814 --> 01:12:22.590
following.
 

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:26.201
You can write it as
½CV^(2) because

01:12:26.201 --> 01:12:28.760
Q/C is a V.
 

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.658
Multiply top and bottom by
C.

01:12:30.658 --> 01:12:34.171
You can write the energy in a
capacitor either in terms of the

01:12:34.171 --> 01:12:37.739
charge stored or in terms of the
voltage between the plates.

01:12:37.739 --> 01:12:41.869
So we'll resume this next time.
 

01:12:41.869 --> 01:12:47.000

WAI CHEE DIMOCK: I just
want to refresh your

00:00:12.267 --> 00:00:13.600
memory about what we talked

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.067
about last time, about the
kindness of strangers.

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:21.100
Last time we spent a lot of
time talking about the

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.033
kindness of strangers, and in
many ways, this as an instance

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:30.933
of Faulkner updating a long
tradition of thinking about

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:36.833
hospitality, and also thinking
about pregnancy outside of

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:40.800
wedlock, or even when you are in
a marriage that the father

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.800
is not your husband --

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.200
so Lena updating Leda from
the Greek classics.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.767
But also thinking about
community, and thinking about

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:59.800
Lena's relation to the Southern
community, and

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.200
updating Southern hospitality as
an updating of the ancient

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.367
Greek idea of hospitality
to strangers.

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:13.867
So today we'll be thinking
more about that, but

00:01:13.867 --> 00:01:17.867
introducing a new term,
and bringing

00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:19.300
Christianity into play.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.433
You guys probably know this--

00:01:20.433 --> 00:01:25.167
Christianity is very important
in Light in August, and

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:28.767
especially the Christian concept
of how we should

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:32.267
conduct ourselves towards
our neighbors.

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:35.633
So we'll be thinking about
that, and the various

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:38.267
permutations that Christian
idea, treat

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:41.500
your neighbor as thyself.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.933
But before we go into that, I
just want to talk a little bit

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:51.500
about the narrative structure of
Light in August. Obviously

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.400
Lena is one very important
half of the narrative.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.733
She represents the undramatic
half of the narrative, very

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:01.067
peaceful, very monotonous.

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:04.367
The only way drama can come into
her part of the story is

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.967
when the supporting cast takes
over and they kind of upstage

00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:11.300
her and become the protagonist
within just that

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.167
short period of time.

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:18.000
So the undramatic narrative
revolving around Lena and

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.467
those people that she comes
into contact with.

00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:24.367
And then opposite to
that is a very

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:25.867
dramatic structure, actually.

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:29.133
And we're beginning to see
that in the reference to

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:32.567
Joanna Burden and her house
being burned down, and the

00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:34.400
spectators saying that it would
be good to have some

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.933
"human fat meat" to
quicken the fire.

00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:43.500
So very, very dramatic
development, and various other

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.967
characters also contribute to
that dramatic narrative.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:50.367
So we'll be looking at Joanna
Burden, Reverend Hightower,

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:53.933
and obviously Joe Christmas.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:57.700
But I just want to start by
going back and looking

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.667
squarely at this injunction
from Leviticus, which is

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:07.533
probably one of the central
tenets of Christianity.

00:03:07.533 --> 00:03:10.033
And we should take it, not just
the last line, which is

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:12.033
the line that all of
us know, but take

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:15.567
it in its full context.

00:03:15.567 --> 00:03:20.200
"You shall not take vengeance
or bear a grudge against the

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.600
sons of your own people, but you
shall love your neighbor

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.033
as yourself.

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:32.467
I am the Lord." So loving your
neighbor is in the context of

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:35.167
you obeying God.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:41.600
So it is under the rubric of
your devotion to God, your

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.467
obedience to God that you should
love your neighbor.

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:51.833
But it's further thickened by
the notion that you should not

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:55.033
take vengeance against others.

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:58.267
We might not necessarily
think of the

00:03:58.267 --> 00:03:59.900
prohibition against vengeance.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.467
In fact, we don't really
associate Christianity with

00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:07.167
the prohibition again
vengeance.

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:12.900
There's just no prohibition
against vengeance in our

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.267
current legal and ethical
thinking.

00:04:17.267 --> 00:04:20.400
Punitive justice is an instance
of, actually,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.233
collective vengeance.

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:23.200
And so it is institutionalized.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.167
There's no prohibition
against vengeance.

00:04:26.167 --> 00:04:29.000
But actually within, at least,
Leviticus, there's a

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.900
prohibition against vengeance.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.333
So if you think about what that
means, and putting that

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:38.367
also under the rubric of
loving your neighbor--

00:04:38.367 --> 00:04:46.467
so all this is very important to
Light in August. But I want

00:04:46.467 --> 00:04:49.633
to further introduce one other
consideration, which is a

00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:53.933
relatively new book that came
out by three very important

00:04:53.933 --> 00:05:01.300
thinkers and philosopher, Slavoj
Zizek, Eric Santner,

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.367
and Kenneth Reinhardt
called The Neighbor.

00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:09.200
The three of them each
had an essay in this

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.300
book called The Neighbor.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.167
And the argument is really
thinking about what the

00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:20.833
concept of neighbor could mean
after the Holocaust, and after

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:24.667
the numerous instances of
genocide that we've witnessed

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:27.367
in the twentieth century and
the twenty-first century.

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:31.667
It seems that the human
propensity is to turn against

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.467
those among whom you've
lived all your life.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.900
It takes such a short
space of time.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.767
Generations of people
might be living

00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:40.767
together in the same place--

00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:42.867
all of a sudden, you turn
against the person

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.133
next door to you.

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:49.067
So the three philosophers think
of this as a case of

00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:50.700
political theology.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:53.467
This is a very interesting
concept.

00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:57.100
It's thinking about the ethics
of social conduct, of

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.167
behavior, towards people who are
not kin to you, who have

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:06.167
no blood ties to you, you have
no obligation other than just

00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:08.867
the obligation of treating them
as neighbors, and what

00:06:08.867 --> 00:06:12.667
the appropriate conduct would
be, what are the limits to

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:15.367
being someone's neighbors,
and what are the licenses

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:17.300
that you can take.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.600
So I'd encourage you just to
take a look at this book, if

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.167
you just want to do some
reading in philosophy.

00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:30.233
But now let's go back to what
we've been talking about a

00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:33.300
little bit last time, and I
just want to remind you of

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.300
this discussion, this
conversation becomes right at

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.667
the heels of thinking about
Byron Bunch being in love.

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:44.100
"'It's a big fire,'
another said.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.833
'What can it be?

00:06:44.833 --> 00:06:48.033
I don't remember anything out
that way big enough to make

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:51.167
all that smoke, except that
Burden house.' 'Maybe that's

00:06:51.167 --> 00:06:52.467
what it is,' another said.

00:06:52.467 --> 00:06:56.667
'My pappy says he can remember
how 50 years ago, folks said

00:06:56.667 --> 00:07:00.733
it ought to be burned, with a
little human fat meat to start

00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:04.033
it good.' 'Maybe your pappy
slipped up there and set it

00:07:04.033 --> 00:07:05.067
afire,' a third said.

00:07:05.067 --> 00:07:06.933
They all laughed."

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:11.767
So this is the other face
of the community.

00:07:11.767 --> 00:07:15.267
Going along with Lena, we have
this idea that human beings

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:17.567
are just all kindness, and
that's all there is.

00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:20.600
But we just know from experience
that that's

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.933
probably just half the story.

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:26.867
So Faulkner is very emphatic
about showing us the other

00:07:26.867 --> 00:07:29.933
face of the neighbor.

00:07:29.933 --> 00:07:35.000
And there's a genealogy
to the Burden house.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.800
In Kipling's poem, "The White
Man's Burden," that people who

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.567
do good, or consider themselves
to do good, quite

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:47.500
often actually incur the
resentments of those

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.233
they do good to.

00:07:48.233 --> 00:07:51.833
It's an interesting kind of
psychological dynamics.

00:07:51.833 --> 00:07:55.200
"Take up the White Man's
burden--/ And reap his old

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.433
reward:/ The blame of those ye
better,/ The hate of those ye

00:08:01.433 --> 00:08:02.200
guard."

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.367
I think that it actually is
quite a natural human tendency

00:08:05.367 --> 00:08:13.267
not to want to get other people
taking care of you in

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:16.367
this particular way, of
doing good to you.

00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:20.300
And so resentment is actually
kind of natural reaction.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:26.433
And what the White Man's Burden
means, especially in

00:08:26.433 --> 00:08:30.033
the context of doing good
to a different race.

00:08:30.033 --> 00:08:34.767
And obviously that issue, it
was front and center during

00:08:34.767 --> 00:08:38.367
reconstruction, when you have
all the slaves becoming

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:39.533
freemen, and what to do--

00:08:39.533 --> 00:08:43.133
and how to educate them and
induct them, really, into

00:08:43.133 --> 00:08:45.000
citizenship.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.267
So lots of Northern reformers
went South, and a lot of them,

00:08:52.267 --> 00:08:56.333
including Joanna Burden's
family, had the idea that they

00:08:56.333 --> 00:09:01.667
would be there as social
reformers, and would be

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:04.167
educating the ex-slaves.

00:09:04.167 --> 00:09:07.967
But they also went by a
different name in American

00:09:07.967 --> 00:09:11.267
history, and that is the name
of the carpetbagger.

00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:16.967
And we can see a very vivid
illustration of that, the huge

00:09:16.967 --> 00:09:19.600
bag that is more than an
appendage, really.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.900
It's the defining feature
of this person.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.800
And there were many, many
cartoons about how much they

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.200
were resented in post-bellum
South.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.600
So there's this is one image
of how doing good, or the

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.100
claim to do good, can actually
benefit yourself.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:43.233
Likewise, the self groaning
under the burden of the-- how

00:09:43.233 --> 00:09:43.800
did that go?

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.667
It's an actual burden
right there.

00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:49.400
And I'm not entirely clear
about the logic of this.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.533
You guys should just try to
figure it out, and email, or

00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:56.133
just write a blog about this, or
email me, if you can figure

00:09:56.133 --> 00:09:56.900
out the exact logic.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.633
Anyway, there's resentment
there, but it's complicated.

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:04.700
So political cartoons can be
really a great way to think

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:10.267
about political history and
social history, and certainly

00:10:10.267 --> 00:10:15.067
a very important background
to Light in August.

00:10:15.067 --> 00:10:17.433
But what we now see is
the outcome of that.

00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:22.467
Joanna Burden, as we know, is
still there as someone who's

00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:23.133
doing good.

00:10:23.133 --> 00:10:27.833
She is on the board of multiple
charities, she gives

00:10:27.833 --> 00:10:30.433
money, she has a black lawyer.

00:10:30.433 --> 00:10:36.467
Basically she's spent her whole
life working towards the

00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:40.000
welfare of the black
population.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.300
And this is what happens to her
at the end of that life.

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.700
But the way that Faulkner is
telling the story, the actual

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.933
tone of that is very
different from the

00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:52.067
tone that I just used.

00:10:52.067 --> 00:10:55.267
"'She was lying on the floor.

00:10:55.267 --> 00:10:58.733
Her head had been cut pretty
near off.'" Oh, this is--

00:10:58.733 --> 00:11:01.100
as is the custom in
Light in August--

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.633
a very dramatic episode is
rendered to us, is retold to

00:11:05.633 --> 00:11:10.067
us by someone who was there,
but not a central

00:11:10.067 --> 00:11:11.900
player in the story.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.867
So this whole discovery of
Joanna Burden's body was

00:11:16.867 --> 00:11:19.800
reported by Byron Bunch
to Hightower.

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.467
And Byron wasn't there to do
the discovering, either.

00:11:22.467 --> 00:11:24.867
He was reporting what a
countryman who was a total

00:11:24.867 --> 00:11:29.300
stranger, and coming to town in
a wagon, a total stranger,

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.233
being given this important
function of discovering Joanna

00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:33.833
Burden's body.

00:11:33.833 --> 00:11:36.433
So this is this countryman
from nowhere,

00:11:36.433 --> 00:11:40.100
telling about the event.

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.167
"'She was lying on the floor.

00:11:42.167 --> 00:11:45.500
Her head had been cut pretty
near off; a lady with the

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.700
beginning of gray hair.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.167
The man said how he stood there
and he could hear the

00:11:50.167 --> 00:11:53.767
fire and there was smoke in the
room itself now, like it

00:11:53.767 --> 00:11:55.800
had done followed him in.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.233
And how he was afraid to try to
pick her up and carry her

00:11:59.233 --> 00:12:03.633
out, because her head might
come clean off.

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:07.133
So he run back into the house
and up the stairs again and

00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:10.400
into the room and jerked the
cover off the bed and rolled

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.667
her onto it like
a sack of meal.

00:12:12.667 --> 00:12:16.033
And he said that what he
was scared of happened.

00:12:16.033 --> 00:12:19.600
Because the cover fell open and
she was laying on her side

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:23.267
facing one way, and her head was
turned clean around like

00:12:23.267 --> 00:12:25.300
she was looking behind her.

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:28.300
And he said that if she could've
just done that when

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.867
she was alive, she might
not have been

00:12:29.867 --> 00:12:31.633
doing it now.'" OK.

00:12:31.633 --> 00:12:34.567
Faulkner is actually repeating
himself, right?

00:12:34.567 --> 00:12:39.300
It's the same kinds of
construction that Lena used

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.967
when she talks about herself
climbing out of the window for

00:12:42.967 --> 00:12:43.767
the last time.

00:12:43.767 --> 00:12:48.533
It was a little difficult, that
time, but if it had been

00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:52.900
that difficult from the first
time, she might not need to be

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.933
doing it now, right?

00:12:53.933 --> 00:12:58.233
So it's exactly the
same structure.

00:12:58.233 --> 00:13:02.867
What is weird is that even in
Lena's case-- even though it

00:13:02.867 --> 00:13:05.500
could have been seen as a
totally unfunny story, it's

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.867
told in a funny way.

00:13:07.867 --> 00:13:10.900
And this episode is--

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.167
it's really hard to see how it
could be funny in any fashion,

00:13:16.167 --> 00:13:20.533
except for the way Faulkner has
chosen to tell the story.

00:13:20.533 --> 00:13:27.067
So this is something very deep
in Faulkner, that his

00:13:27.067 --> 00:13:33.433
temptation, his compulsion, is
to tell a tragic story from a

00:13:33.433 --> 00:13:34.467
comic point of view.

00:13:34.467 --> 00:13:38.067
And we can the speculate
about why this is such

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:41.000
a pattern in him.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.100
But I think that he really
doesn't want to give tragedy

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.033
the entirety of the field.

00:13:49.033 --> 00:13:52.000
If we can think of the narrative
field as either

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.500
full-occupancy or
half-occupancy, tragedy is

00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:00.900
granted no more than half
occupancy of the narrative

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.967
field at any given moment.

00:14:03.967 --> 00:14:07.600
And maybe it's not even
half; here it seems to

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.533
be less than half.

00:14:09.533 --> 00:14:12.867
So here's the country man
worrying about all the things

00:14:12.867 --> 00:14:15.367
that one really shouldn't be
worrying about when you're

00:14:15.367 --> 00:14:17.467
discovering a dead body.

00:14:17.467 --> 00:14:24.033
And the very contrived plot
detail that Joanna Burden's

00:14:24.033 --> 00:14:28.467
head is turned around, so
she's looking backwards.

00:14:28.467 --> 00:14:33.900
And it turns out that there's
actually a very venerable

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.133
genealogy to that particular
configuration of the dead

00:14:38.133 --> 00:14:41.267
human body or human head
in relation to

00:14:41.267 --> 00:14:42.867
the rest of the body.

00:14:42.867 --> 00:14:46.967
It turns out that the epic is
coming into play as well,

00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:51.200
because in the Divine Comedy,
in Canto XX, there's a very

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.633
famous episode of Dante and
Virgil going to hell and

00:14:56.633 --> 00:14:59.700
seeing all these people in
hell being punished, and

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.600
Dante's way of punishment is by
the logic of contrapasso,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.900
that the punishment is the
repetition of your crime.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.133
So this is what he sees--

00:15:10.133 --> 00:15:12.533
a whole group of people
with heads set around.

00:15:12.533 --> 00:15:16.833
"As I inclined my head still
more, I saw that each,

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:22.200
amazingly, appeared contorted
between the chin and where the

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.000
chest begins.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.067
They had their faces twisted
toward the haunches, and found

00:15:29.067 --> 00:15:33.533
it necessary to walk backwards
because they could not see

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:39.233
ahead of them." And this is
an illustration, a Flaxman

00:15:39.233 --> 00:15:43.933
illustration, of all these
people in hell, their heads

00:15:43.933 --> 00:15:45.367
turned backwards.

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:48.100
And the reason that they are
punished in this particular

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:51.933
way is that in life, they
were soothsayers.

00:15:51.933 --> 00:15:55.033
They claimed to be foreseeing
the future.

00:15:55.033 --> 00:16:00.433
And of course, in Dante's
cosmos, this quite sever

00:16:00.433 --> 00:16:05.833
Christian cosmos, unlike the
Greek tradition, human beings

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:07.933
are not really supposed to know

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:09.733
anything about the future.

00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:12.467
Foreknowledge is not
a privilege that

00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:14.267
human beings can claim.

00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:17.200
So as a consequence of claiming
foreknowledge of the

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:20.167
future, these people were
punished in hell by having

00:16:20.167 --> 00:16:22.833
their heads turned backwards.

00:16:22.833 --> 00:16:25.767
And we can also think of
Faulkner, in many ways,

00:16:25.767 --> 00:16:27.167
thinking of this as a fit

00:16:27.167 --> 00:16:29.633
punishment for social reformers.

00:16:29.633 --> 00:16:33.567
Social reformers also claim to
have some kind of privileged

00:16:33.567 --> 00:16:37.867
relation to the future, and
they're reforming the present

00:16:37.867 --> 00:16:41.300
quite often because they have
this vision about the future.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:44.400
They want the present to
approximate the vision of the

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.833
future that they can see.

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:49.900
So maybe that is the connection
between Joanna and

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.500
these ancient soothsayers.

00:16:55.067 --> 00:16:57.833
So there's a kind of a thematic
connection, but the

00:16:57.833 --> 00:17:03.633
tonal connection is different.

00:17:03.633 --> 00:17:10.700
If we think about Dante's
incidents in the Divine

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.133
Comedy, there's just
no humor in it.

00:17:15.133 --> 00:17:18.667
It's a terrible sight to see
all the people with their

00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:19.933
heads turned backwards.

00:17:19.933 --> 00:17:22.067
And likewise, in this
representation, there's

00:17:22.067 --> 00:17:23.567
nothing funny about this.

00:17:23.567 --> 00:17:27.133
It could have been done in a
funny fashion, but it's never

00:17:27.133 --> 00:17:30.933
done in a funny fashion,
whereas Faulkner's

00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:34.733
representation of Joanna
is definitely comic.

00:17:34.733 --> 00:17:41.700
So it seems that every time, any
time Faulkner invokes an

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:47.067
analogy from a prior text,
it's always rewriting the

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:52.733
text, and changing especially
the tone of that episode.

00:17:52.733 --> 00:17:58.467
So from Joanna, we get a kind of
complicated picture of the

00:17:58.467 --> 00:18:00.700
malice of neighbors.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.133
Well, actually, she's not killed
by her neighbors, as

00:18:03.133 --> 00:18:04.200
we'll find out.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.833
So even though the neighbors
are kind of rejoicing and

00:18:07.833 --> 00:18:10.433
having a lot of fun over the
fact that she is killed, and

00:18:10.433 --> 00:18:12.167
that her house is
burning down--

00:18:12.167 --> 00:18:15.967
even though they are enjoying
it, they're actually not the

00:18:15.967 --> 00:18:18.100
instruments for her killing.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.467
So that's important
to remember.

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:24.367
And also that Faulkner, for
some reason, chooses to

00:18:24.367 --> 00:18:27.867
approach it from a very odd
angle, so that it's not

00:18:27.867 --> 00:18:31.100
exactly sympathy that Faulkner
is trying to

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:33.433
generate from the reader.

00:18:33.433 --> 00:18:38.633
We should ask, what kind of
readers' responses he's is

00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:41.500
cultivating in that particular
episode, but it's definitely

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.200
not sympathy for Joanna.

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.800
So that puts us in a very
peculiar relation as well,

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.933
because in some sense, we are
the neighbors to Joanna.

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:56.633
We are just like those neighbors
who have some fun at

00:18:56.633 --> 00:18:58.433
her expense.

00:18:58.433 --> 00:19:01.967
We the readers are also having
some fun at her experience.

00:19:01.967 --> 00:19:05.333
So that is the kind
of narrative that

00:19:05.333 --> 00:19:07.467
Faulkner is giving us.

00:19:07.467 --> 00:19:13.233
But to move on to the next
figure, who also enacts a kind

00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:18.967
of dance, a permutation of the
various meanings of neighbor--

00:19:18.967 --> 00:19:22.400
and this one, actually, is given
more space in terms of

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:28.033
this full development of the
various incarnations of the

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:30.667
concept of neighbor.

00:19:30.667 --> 00:19:34.467
So this is the Reverend
Hightower, who came to town,

00:19:34.467 --> 00:19:40.700
and then all of a sudden he
loses his job as a minister,

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:44.300
and then rumors start going
around about his relation with

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.600
blacks, as well.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.133
And this is what happens
to him one night.

00:19:49.133 --> 00:19:53.833
"Because that evening, some men,
not masked either, took

00:19:53.833 --> 00:19:55.900
the negro man out"--

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.700
this is the cook-- "took the
negro man out and whipped him.

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:03.933
And when Hightower waked the
next morning his study window

00:20:03.933 --> 00:20:08.767
was broken and on the floor lay
a brick with a note tied

00:20:08.767 --> 00:20:12.767
to it, commanding him to get
out of town by sunset and

00:20:12.767 --> 00:20:17.933
signed K.K.K. And he did not go,
and on the second morning

00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:22.467
a man found him in the woods
about a mile from town.

00:20:22.467 --> 00:20:27.033
He had been tied to a tree
and beaten unconscious."

00:20:27.033 --> 00:20:30.033
So this is exactly
the same people--

00:20:30.033 --> 00:20:37.367
the same people who
were kind to Lena

00:20:37.367 --> 00:20:39.467
probably were all Klansmen.

00:20:39.467 --> 00:20:41.600
It was quite a common --

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.667
it has very deep roots,
actually, in some Southern

00:20:44.667 --> 00:20:46.167
communities.

00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:49.700
And lots of people were Klansmen
that you might not

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.933
think would be Klansmen.

00:20:51.933 --> 00:20:54.867
New studies also have shown that
actually lots of women

00:20:54.867 --> 00:20:57.567
were Klansmen, as well.

00:20:57.567 --> 00:21:02.367
So we just don't know who--

00:21:02.367 --> 00:21:04.200
whether, in this case,
it was just men.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:05.200
But what is interesting--

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:09.600
there are actually two
interesting facts about this.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.667
One is that the men
are not masked.

00:21:13.667 --> 00:21:15.533
I think that that says a lot.

00:21:15.533 --> 00:21:21.000
That actually, in any kind of
Klan action, the people would

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.767
be hooded, so you don't actually
see the faces.

00:21:24.767 --> 00:21:27.133
But this is a variation
on that.

00:21:27.133 --> 00:21:29.667
These men are not hooded,
they're not masked.

00:21:29.667 --> 00:21:31.667
So that's a very important
thing, revealing their

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:35.067
identities fully to Hightower.

00:21:35.067 --> 00:21:39.500
And then the other detail is
that obviously they want

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.800
Hightower to leave town,
and he does not go.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.533
Even though he's beaten
unconscious, he still refuses

00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:52.067
to leave. So these two are very
important variations to

00:21:52.067 --> 00:21:55.267
the customary story about
Klan violence.

00:21:55.267 --> 00:21:57.100
And we'll see what
comes from that.

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.133
That Faulkner's both giving us
a very recognizable Southern

00:22:00.133 --> 00:22:05.100
history, but also, he's giving
us a very important variation

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.667
on this Southern history.

00:22:06.667 --> 00:22:10.500
So let's follow the kind
of permutation of

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.567
the malice of strangers.

00:22:12.567 --> 00:22:15.100
"He refused to tell
who had done it.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.533
The town knew that that was
wrong, and some of them men

00:22:18.533 --> 00:22:21.900
came to him and tried again
to persuade him to leave

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.300
Jefferson, for his own good,
telling him that next time

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.700
they might kill him.

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.700
But he refused to leave. He
would not talk about the

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.600
beating, even when they offered
to prosecute the men

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:35.867
who had done it.

00:22:35.867 --> 00:22:38.033
But he would do neither.

00:22:38.033 --> 00:22:41.567
He would neither tell
nor depart.

00:22:41.567 --> 00:22:44.333
And then all of a sudden, the
whole thing seemed to blow

00:22:44.333 --> 00:22:47.367
away like an evil wind.

00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:50.700
It was as though the town
realized at last that he would

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.933
be a part of its life until he
died, and that they might as

00:22:54.933 --> 00:22:57.600
well become reconciled."

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.267
So this is the crucial,
different story that Faulkner

00:23:02.267 --> 00:23:05.067
is telling about Southern
history.

00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:08.833
Is that the malice of
your neighbors is

00:23:08.833 --> 00:23:10.167
the starting point.

00:23:10.167 --> 00:23:13.833
It is not the endpoint.

00:23:13.833 --> 00:23:18.133
It would be too easy, too much
of a cliche to say these

00:23:18.133 --> 00:23:19.933
people are just bigoted.

00:23:19.933 --> 00:23:23.000
And they're going to persecute
anyone who's

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.867
not of the same mind.

00:23:23.867 --> 00:23:26.400
It would be much too
simple to say that.

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.267
So this is the very important
variation.

00:23:28.267 --> 00:23:31.600
The men are not masked.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.300
They put it within Hightower's
power to report them.

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:40.433
And the town is, in fact, ready
to prosecute those men.

00:23:40.433 --> 00:23:47.000
So in fact the legal action is
about to get started, and

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.467
certainly there's actionable
violence.

00:23:49.467 --> 00:23:56.600
But just as those people who
were beating Hightower put it

00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:03.567
within his power to report on
him, he refuses to use that

00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:07.267
power that they've put
into his hands.

00:24:07.267 --> 00:24:11.400
So this is a strange
kind of symmetry.

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:16.700
For me, this is the most
interesting and compelling

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.233
kind of reciprocity--

00:24:19.233 --> 00:24:23.067
that you put yourself in the
power of someone that you

00:24:23.067 --> 00:24:28.733
hate, and you don't use the
power that those whom you

00:24:28.733 --> 00:24:35.067
hate, or those who hate you,
have vested in your hands.

00:24:35.067 --> 00:24:37.533
Given the fact that there's so
much violence going on, this

00:24:37.533 --> 00:24:42.200
is actually an incredibly
delicate ethical gesture on

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.300
both their parts.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.067
And I would say that this is--

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:49.500
I don't know how, I mean, maybe
this is too utopian.

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:52.100
I'm just reporting to you, this
is what I think Faulkner

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:56.433
is doing, that this is the way
that he would like to tell the

00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:58.800
story, and it's just the way
that he hopes that human

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.633
beings will conduct themselves
under those circumstances.

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:05.633
I should also point out that
actually, in the book that I

00:25:05.633 --> 00:25:08.267
mentioned earlier, The Neighbor,
there's actually a

00:25:08.267 --> 00:25:12.167
strong argument in favor of
ethical violence, that

00:25:12.167 --> 00:25:15.933
sometimes you just can't help
doing violence to someone, but

00:25:15.933 --> 00:25:18.267
how to be ethical about that.

00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:22.400
So for me, this actually is
an instance of ethical--

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.933
qualified, highly
qualified, but

00:25:23.933 --> 00:25:26.767
nonetheless, ethical violence.

00:25:26.767 --> 00:25:29.500
And I think it's because
of that.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:33.400
Because actually, this is
violence within limits.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.133
It is violence that actually has
a degree of lawfulness to

00:25:37.133 --> 00:25:40.400
it, in the sense that the law
is going to prosecute them.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.833
And those perpetrators actually
have put themselves

00:25:43.833 --> 00:25:47.800
under the jurisdiction
off the law.

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.333
There's a degree of lawfulness
to that kind of violence

00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:52.267
because of that.

00:25:52.267 --> 00:25:56.367
Though I think that Hightower
actually has this to say about

00:25:56.367 --> 00:25:58.400
his neighbors.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.967
Hightower says, "'They
are good people.

00:26:01.967 --> 00:26:07.300
They must believe what they must
believe, especially as it

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:12.000
was I who was at one time
both master and

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.167
servant of their believing.

00:26:14.167 --> 00:26:18.500
And so it is not for me to
outrage their believing nor

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.033
for Byron Bunch to say
that they were wrong.

00:26:22.033 --> 00:26:26.467
Because all that any man can
hope for is to be permitted to

00:26:26.467 --> 00:26:29.333
live quietly among
his fellows."

00:26:29.333 --> 00:26:31.833
So this is one kind of idea.

00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:36.000
It's that you can't really
change what people

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.500
believe about you.

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.600
They can have all kinds of
wrong beliefs about you--

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:45.633
there's no way you can
change those beliefs.

00:26:45.633 --> 00:26:47.867
There's no way you can
change how some other

00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:49.833
people feel about you.

00:26:49.833 --> 00:26:52.467
Feeling is not something that
you can dictate, and other

00:26:52.467 --> 00:26:55.200
people, if they happen to hate
you, there's nothing you can

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.000
do about that.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.133
So that is a very tough-minded
evaluation of the privacy of

00:27:02.133 --> 00:27:05.700
certain kinds of sentiment that
are not pretty, that do

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.300
not make for harmonious
relations among human beings.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:13.200
And hatred is a very powerful
reality for Faulkner.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.600
So you just have to live with
that, that some people just

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.800
don't like you all much.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:23.000
And given the fact that, how can
you still manage to live

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.033
quietly and peacefully among
people who don't like

00:27:27.033 --> 00:27:28.033
you all that much?

00:27:28.033 --> 00:27:30.767
That is the ethical challenge
for Hightower.

00:27:30.767 --> 00:27:35.933
So all this suggests that for
him, for now, at this moment--

00:27:35.933 --> 00:27:38.000
on page 75--

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:44.233
Hightower is the voice of a
certain kind of ethical norm

00:27:44.233 --> 00:27:45.567
in Faulkner.

00:27:45.567 --> 00:27:48.167
And it's not surprising that
his name is Hightower.

00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:52.000
It's almost kind of very
elevated, very high kind,

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.267
maybe impossibly high kind,
of ethical norm.

00:27:55.267 --> 00:27:58.900
Very few of us actually
can behave as he

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.467
does at this moment.

00:28:01.467 --> 00:28:07.167
But I think that we should also
be aware that Hightower

00:28:07.167 --> 00:28:11.800
actually doesn't occupy that
moral height all time.

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.067
Just as the narrative field
is quite often a field of

00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:17.933
half-occupancy --

00:28:17.933 --> 00:28:21.533
nothing can fully occupy
that field --

00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:26.400
moral elevation is also a place
where you can't have

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.333
full command all the time.

00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:33.367
So this is a sullen, distant
image of Hightower from the

00:28:33.367 --> 00:28:34.400
town's point of view.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.067
People don't like him
all that much.

00:28:36.067 --> 00:28:39.367
What they think about
Hightower.

00:28:39.367 --> 00:28:42.400
"But the town said to Hightower
that if Hightower"--

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.833
and this is not talking about
his black cook anymore, and

00:28:44.833 --> 00:28:46.467
not talking about
the violence.

00:28:46.467 --> 00:28:49.300
They're talking about something
else, to other

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.700
things about Hightower.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.300
One is that he seems complete
fixated on the Civil War.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.467
He seems completely fixated on
this grandfather's death in

00:28:56.467 --> 00:28:57.433
the Civil War.

00:28:57.433 --> 00:28:58.700
The horse is galloping.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.400
That is the reality for him.

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.067
And the other, his wife is going
crazy in that marriage,

00:29:04.067 --> 00:29:06.233
and he doesn't seem to be able
to do anything about it.

00:29:06.233 --> 00:29:09.933
So this is the town's commentary
on those two other

00:29:09.933 --> 00:29:13.333
aspects of Hightower's life, and
you can see why he doesn't

00:29:13.333 --> 00:29:17.733
have full command of the ethical
elevation that we've

00:29:17.733 --> 00:29:20.267
just seen him in.

00:29:20.267 --> 00:29:25.367
"But the town said that if
Hightower had just been a more

00:29:25.367 --> 00:29:29.300
dependable kind of man, the kind
of man a minister should

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.733
be, instead of being born about
30 years after the only

00:29:32.733 --> 00:29:35.633
day he seemed to have
ever lived in--

00:29:35.633 --> 00:29:38.400
the day when his grandfather
was shot from

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.967
the galloping horse--

00:29:39.967 --> 00:29:42.433
she would have been all
right too." The wife.

00:29:42.433 --> 00:29:47.167
"But he was not, and the
neighbors would hear her

00:29:47.167 --> 00:29:51.333
weeping in the parsonage in
the afternoons or late at

00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:56.300
night, and the neighbors knowing
that the husband would

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.767
not know what to do about it
because he did not know what

00:29:59.767 --> 00:30:00.433
was wrong."

00:30:00.433 --> 00:30:03.067
So all of a sudden the
neighbors have been

00:30:03.067 --> 00:30:09.433
transformed from the
perpetrators of violence to an

00:30:09.433 --> 00:30:12.967
independent voice
of judgment on

00:30:12.967 --> 00:30:15.767
Hightower and on the marriage.

00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:19.733
They're functioning more like
a Greek chorus in the sense

00:30:19.733 --> 00:30:24.667
that they have some knowledge
about the marriage that is

00:30:24.667 --> 00:30:28.167
denied to Hightower himself.

00:30:28.167 --> 00:30:31.667
And so we should not forget for
a minute that a man who

00:30:31.667 --> 00:30:37.833
has such a delicate ethical
understanding of a certain

00:30:37.833 --> 00:30:42.300
kind of situation having to do
with violence that is done to

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:48.667
himself can be completely blind
in another situation

00:30:48.667 --> 00:30:51.733
where it would have been good
for him to be just a little

00:30:51.733 --> 00:30:53.100
more sensitive.

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:58.000
So there's the utter lack of
sensitivity in Hightower that

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.700
qualifies his claim
to that ethical

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.267
height that we've seen.

00:31:02.267 --> 00:31:03.733
It's a totally different
issue.

00:31:03.733 --> 00:31:07.200
It doesn't take away from the
beating, it doesn't take away

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.667
from the Klan action, but it
does suggest that Hightower is

00:31:11.667 --> 00:31:15.267
a divided figure, and
he doesn't speak for

00:31:15.267 --> 00:31:16.433
Faulkner all the time.

00:31:16.433 --> 00:31:19.467
That Faulkner is actually using
his neighbors sometimes

00:31:19.467 --> 00:31:22.800
to pass judgment on him, just
as he is a dispenser of

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.400
judgment on others.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.067
So this is neighbors in a
different light, but there's

00:31:28.067 --> 00:31:30.400
yet another twist. So Faulkner
doesn't stop.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:34.600
This is a constant switching
back and forth.

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.900
The swing of the pendulum from
the right being on the

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.867
neighbors' side to the right
being on Hightower's side, and

00:31:40.867 --> 00:31:42.367
injury being done
to Hightower.

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:46.667
So this is the neighbors
in yet another right.

00:31:46.667 --> 00:31:47.800
"Within two days"--

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.500
this is a little bit later.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.167
Hightower is trying to
deliver a black baby.

00:31:52.167 --> 00:31:54.167
The baby dies.

00:31:54.167 --> 00:31:58.233
And within two days, rumors
were going around town.

00:31:58.233 --> 00:32:00.767
"Within two days there were
those who said that the child

00:32:00.767 --> 00:32:05.600
was Hightower's and that he had
let it die deliberately.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.667
But Byron believed that even the
ones who said this did not

00:32:09.667 --> 00:32:10.767
believe it.

00:32:10.767 --> 00:32:14.800
He believed that the town had
had the habit of saying things

00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.400
about the disgraced minister
which they did not believe

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.333
themselves."

00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:23.933
So this is yet another
interesting portrait of how

00:32:23.933 --> 00:32:27.600
people behave as
a collectivity.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.300
That as a collectivity, we tend
to say things that we do

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:36.367
not actually, ourselves,
individually believe in.

00:32:36.367 --> 00:32:42.167
This is the nature, quite often,
of rumors, or just kind

00:32:42.167 --> 00:32:47.400
of standardized statements about
the current situation

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.400
that you just repeat
a certain line.

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.000
This is the nature of a line,
that it's fed to others, and

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.800
that we would mouth without
thinking about it.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.367
And all of us do it.

00:32:57.367 --> 00:33:01.067
It's not just people living
in a small town.

00:33:01.067 --> 00:33:03.567
All of us tend to say certain
things that we haven't

00:33:03.567 --> 00:33:07.767
actually personally thought
about, including damaging

00:33:07.767 --> 00:33:11.800
things that we can say about
someone, like having a child

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:13.333
and allowing the child to die.

00:33:13.333 --> 00:33:17.200
So this is the nature of rumor,
and Byron's insight--

00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.200
and he knows these people
very well--

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:26.067
is that in one sense, it is
speech that seems hurtful that

00:33:26.067 --> 00:33:28.933
actually doesn't have personal
malice in it.

00:33:28.933 --> 00:33:33.467
So we have to be very careful
to distinguish that hurtful

00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:39.733
speech can certainly inflict
injury on the person that that

00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:40.833
speech is about.

00:33:40.833 --> 00:33:43.000
It can inflict injury.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.833
But something can't inflict
injury without having a lot of

00:33:47.833 --> 00:33:51.033
personal malice in it, and
that is the crucial

00:33:51.033 --> 00:33:56.233
distinction that Byron
wants us to make.

00:33:56.233 --> 00:33:59.200
So we can see it constantly
things are

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.633
switching back and forth.

00:34:00.633 --> 00:34:03.500
So we've been talking about
it since Tuesday--

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:06.933
the protagonist and supporting
cast constant switch,

00:34:06.933 --> 00:34:10.167
background, foreground, dark
and light, Light in August,

00:34:10.167 --> 00:34:14.133
Dark House, the other title for
the novel, kind and unkind

00:34:14.133 --> 00:34:17.700
neighbors, dramatic narrative
versus undramatic narrative.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:22.867
But all of this is coming to
head in the switch between

00:34:22.867 --> 00:34:25.900
Lena Grove and Joe Christmas.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:31.800
And this is a very interesting
narrative innovation on the

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.667
part of Faulkner.

00:34:34.667 --> 00:34:38.833
We've seen in The Sound and
the Fury that it is a

00:34:38.833 --> 00:34:40.867
four-section novel, right?

00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:46.333
In As I Lay Dying, many, many,
too many to count, sections

00:34:46.333 --> 00:34:50.033
completely split into tiny
little narratives.

00:34:50.033 --> 00:34:55.800
And in this novel, it's really
the story of two people who

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.167
are strangers to each other.

00:34:58.167 --> 00:35:01.733
It's really a huge challenge
how you could tell a story

00:35:01.733 --> 00:35:05.533
about two people who have no
connection to each other, but

00:35:05.533 --> 00:35:08.167
make the two stories
one novel.

00:35:08.167 --> 00:35:11.533
So we'll see how that is
played out, and whether

00:35:11.533 --> 00:35:16.100
Faulkner is completely
successful in turning these

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.400
two into a single story.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:23.233
But today, we'll look at part
of what he's trying to do, I

00:35:23.233 --> 00:35:27.500
think, and look at the
contrasting functions of Lena

00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.500
Grove and Joe Christmas
in this novel.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.333
Obviously we know that
one is a positive

00:35:33.333 --> 00:35:36.467
catalyst for the community.

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:41.767
All the good things about the
community come out when we see

00:35:41.767 --> 00:35:46.800
Lena Grove in action, and all
the bad things about the

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.833
community come out
when we see Joe

00:35:49.833 --> 00:35:51.233
Christmas's part of the story.

00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:53.700
So one is a positive catalyst,
the other is a negative

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.700
catalyst. But what is odd is
that even though this seems to

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:02.133
put them on opposite ends of the
narrative spectrum, quite

00:36:02.133 --> 00:36:07.433
often Faulkner also contrives
to make them meet as well.

00:36:07.433 --> 00:36:10.100
So it's a very interesting
kinship, actually, between the

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.600
two of them, even though
they seem so different.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.500
So we'll talk about the
linguistic kinship, and also

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.800
the fact that both of them seem
to be passive receptacles

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.700
for what is coming to them.

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.867
So first, I think you
know this, but just

00:36:24.867 --> 00:36:26.400
want to repeat it.

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.167
From Lena, this is the story.

00:36:28.167 --> 00:36:29.367
"'Folks have been kind.

00:36:29.367 --> 00:36:33.900
They have been right kind.'" It
is a very monotonous story.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.367
In that sense, she's not very
great character, not a

00:36:38.367 --> 00:36:41.467
completely helpful character to
Faulkner, because she only

00:36:41.467 --> 00:36:46.400
knows one thing, and the
story never changes.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:52.800
So he really has to introduce
a kind of a counterpoint to

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:59.633
Lena, whose very name already
precipitates a negative

00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:05.167
response from the people who
are learning about his name

00:37:05.167 --> 00:37:05.967
for the first time.

00:37:05.967 --> 00:37:07.200
So he used to be the foreman.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.833
Joe Christmas is just getting
a job from these people.

00:37:12.833 --> 00:37:14.733
"'His name is what?' one said.

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:17.600
'Christmas.' 'Is he a
foreigner?' 'Did you hear of a

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.900
white man named Christmas?'
the foreman said. 'I never

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:24.700
heard of nobody a-tall named
it,' the other said."

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:28.467
So just to have the
name Christmas--

00:37:28.467 --> 00:37:33.167
and I can't really think of a
name that is less neutral,

00:37:33.167 --> 00:37:36.900
less innocuous than the
name Christmas.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:41.700
But even for us, I think to hear
someone called Christmas,

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.267
there will be a kind
of strange response

00:37:43.267 --> 00:37:44.200
from most of us.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:47.233
And sure enough, there's a
strange response from these

00:37:47.233 --> 00:37:49.367
two people.

00:37:49.367 --> 00:37:52.467
So why is it that in
fact, we're not

00:37:52.467 --> 00:37:55.833
entirely immune from that?

00:37:55.833 --> 00:38:00.467
It's not as if the world that
Faulkner is creating is

00:38:00.467 --> 00:38:03.067
completely apart
from our world.

00:38:03.067 --> 00:38:05.767
I think in many ways, we're
part of that world.

00:38:05.767 --> 00:38:07.600
But we're suddenly
seeing an extreme

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.233
reaction these two people.

00:38:10.233 --> 00:38:12.167
All of a sudden--

00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:14.333
nobody has even thought of him
as being a foreigner, suddenly

00:38:14.333 --> 00:38:16.200
he's got to be a foreigner,
even worse than that.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.533
Even foreigners don't have
a name like Christmas.

00:38:18.533 --> 00:38:21.300
So maybe he's non-human.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.033
Not quite that.

00:38:22.033 --> 00:38:28.533
But he suddenly is in an
unclassifiable, but negatively

00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:30.333
unclassifiable, category.

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.067
And the rest of the story
really plays on the

00:38:36.067 --> 00:38:41.333
consequences, in many ways, of
having a name like Christmas.

00:38:41.333 --> 00:38:47.367
But for now, I want actually
not to go there yet, but to

00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:54.000
talk about a very strange kind
of kinship between Lena and

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.233
Joe, who otherwise seem
so different.

00:38:57.233 --> 00:39:00.467
It's a completely
counterintuitive kinship and I

00:39:00.467 --> 00:39:02.433
think it's also quite
deliberate.

00:39:02.433 --> 00:39:05.533
So let's just go back to this
passage that we've talked

00:39:05.533 --> 00:39:10.400
about last time, about Lena's
peaceful journey, "behind her

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:16.067
the four weeks, the evocation of
far, is a peaceful corridor

00:39:16.067 --> 00:39:20.100
paved with unflagging and
tranquil faith and peopled

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:26.467
with kind and nameless faces and
voices," is the nature of

00:39:26.467 --> 00:39:27.700
Lena's journey.

00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:33.533
And oddly enough, the same kind
of language is used again

00:39:33.533 --> 00:39:37.300
at a very different moment in
the story, for Joe Christmas,

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:43.533
when he's actually just about
ready to do the killing.

00:39:43.533 --> 00:39:47.567
"'Maybe I have already
done it,' he thought.

00:39:47.567 --> 00:39:52.267
'Maybe it is no longer now
waiting to be done.' It seemed

00:39:52.267 --> 00:39:57.567
to him that he could see the
yellow day opening peacefully

00:39:57.567 --> 00:40:03.033
before him like a corridor,
an arras, into a still

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:06.167
chiaroscuro without urgency.

00:40:06.167 --> 00:40:09.933
It seemed to him that as he
sat there the yellow day

00:40:09.933 --> 00:40:14.867
contemplated him drowsily, like
a prone and somnolent

00:40:14.867 --> 00:40:16.000
yellow cat.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.800
He would not move, apparently
arrested and held immobile by

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:23.967
a single word which had perhaps
not yet impacted, his

00:40:23.967 --> 00:40:28.800
whole being suspended in quiet
and sunny space, so that

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.000
hanging motionless and without
physical weight he seemed to

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
watch the slow flowing
of beneath him."

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.333
It is exactly, one could just
put Lena right in there, and

00:40:40.333 --> 00:40:43.000
it would have been a description
of the journey.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:48.233
So I hope that it makes no sense
to you, why Faulkner

00:40:48.233 --> 00:40:52.267
would want to use this for Joe
Christmas right before the

00:40:52.267 --> 00:40:54.367
moment of violence.

00:40:54.367 --> 00:41:00.533
I think this it's something
that cries out to be

00:41:00.533 --> 00:41:03.900
interpreted by the reader,
why there should be the

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:09.333
duplication of the
once-appropriate language for

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:12.000
Lena into this completely
inappropriate and

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.600
counterintuitive content.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:20.033
But all we can say is that this
is a quite heavy-handed

00:41:20.033 --> 00:41:23.667
attempt on Faulkner's part to
generate a linguistic kinship

00:41:23.667 --> 00:41:25.367
between the two of them.

00:41:25.367 --> 00:41:28.500
Let's look at another instance,
and in fact, we see

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:33.667
it a little bit in the use of
gerunds in talking about this

00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:37.067
moment of impending, incipient
violence, when he is held

00:41:37.067 --> 00:41:39.967
suspended, but very peaceful.

00:41:39.967 --> 00:41:43.500
And so this is the use of
gerunds, and we've seen that

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.300
in Lena, as well.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:49.000
"'That far within my hearing,
before my seeing.' 'I will be

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.100
riding within the hearing of
Lucas Burch before his seeing.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.333
He will hear the wagon,
but he won't know.

00:41:55.333 --> 00:41:58.767
So there will be one within his
hearing before his seeing.

00:41:58.767 --> 00:42:01.033
And then he will see me and
he will be excited.

00:42:01.033 --> 00:42:04.467
And so there will be two within
his seeing before his

00:42:04.467 --> 00:42:07.100
remembering." Completely highly

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:09.800
conspicuous use of the gerund.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:13.600
And there's also a parallel,
highly conspicuous use of the

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.267
gerund for Joe Christmas.
"Knowing not grieving

00:42:17.267 --> 00:42:21.067
remembers a thousand savage and
lonely streets." The same

00:42:21.067 --> 00:42:26.033
use of the gerund, but in a
completely different context

00:42:26.033 --> 00:42:28.967
and completely different
thematics.

00:42:28.967 --> 00:42:33.600
So we really have to think a
little more about why it is,

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:37.667
even though the two of them
seem polar opposites that

00:42:37.667 --> 00:42:42.433
Faulkner, nonetheless, sees
and is emphatic about the

00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:44.100
kinship between the
two of them.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:50.667
So maybe one way to think about
it is to once again

00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:54.600
think about the relation between
an individual and a

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:57.900
collectivity, or at least
various representatives of

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.233
that collectivity.

00:43:00.233 --> 00:43:04.667
And with Lena, we've seen that
she really is a passive

00:43:04.667 --> 00:43:08.133
receptacle for all the Southern
hospitality that is

00:43:08.133 --> 00:43:09.500
coming to her.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.700
And maybe that's why she's
really not that interesting on

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:18.267
her own, that it really takes
action from other people to

00:43:18.267 --> 00:43:21.733
vest her narrative with any
kind of action at all.

00:43:21.733 --> 00:43:23.133
Left to her own devices
there will be no

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:25.567
story to tell, really.

00:43:25.567 --> 00:43:28.800
And so she's a passive
receptacle in the sense that

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:34.067
she's really the narrative
device by which a community

00:43:34.067 --> 00:43:38.400
gets to tell a story, by which
the action of a community gets

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.433
dramatized, and gets registered
within the compass

00:43:42.433 --> 00:43:44.933
of a single individual.

00:43:44.933 --> 00:43:49.133
And I would say that that is
also the narrative function of

00:43:49.133 --> 00:43:51.233
Joe Christmas, as well.

00:43:51.233 --> 00:43:53.967
That in many ways, even though
he's probably more

00:43:53.967 --> 00:43:57.467
psychologically complex than
Lena, and it will be

00:43:57.467 --> 00:43:58.633
interesting to think
about what kind of

00:43:58.633 --> 00:44:00.600
psychology he has--

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:05.167
in spite of the complexity of
his psychology, he has a

00:44:05.167 --> 00:44:11.033
similar narrative function in
the sense that he is the

00:44:11.033 --> 00:44:16.033
vehicle by which somebody else's
action, somebody else's

00:44:16.033 --> 00:44:18.200
drama, gets registered.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:21.833
So he is the template on
which someone else

00:44:21.833 --> 00:44:24.767
writes a dramatic narrative.

00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:30.167
So this is the continuation of
that peaceful moment when he's

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:32.467
about to do the killing.

00:44:32.467 --> 00:44:37.200
"He just sat there, not moving,
until after a while he

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.733
heard the clock two miles
away strike 12.

00:44:40.733 --> 00:44:43.600
Then he rose and moved
toward the house.

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.800
He didn't go fast. He didn't
think even then, Something is

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:49.333
going to happen.

00:44:49.333 --> 00:44:52.800
Something is going
to happen to me."

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:54.800
That syntactical
construction--

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:58.000
not, I'm going to do something,
but something is

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.933
going to happen to me, so
that I will actually

00:45:00.933 --> 00:45:02.300
kill someone --

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:07.033
it's that bizarre transformation
of what would

00:45:07.033 --> 00:45:10.167
have been a very familiar
sentence.

00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:16.000
So even the most dramatic
fashion that he's responsible

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.667
for is cast as something that
is happening to him without

00:45:21.667 --> 00:45:24.400
his volition almost.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:28.067
And we see that this is
actually the logical

00:45:28.067 --> 00:45:33.900
combination of a pattern that
has been the dominant pattern

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.167
all through his life.

00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:38.433
So it goes back, this moment
goes back to when he was a

00:45:38.433 --> 00:45:44.233
kid, when he was hiding and
eating toothpaste in the

00:45:44.233 --> 00:45:47.500
closet of the dietitian, and
getting sick from the

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.733
toothpaste, and then witnessing
this completely

00:45:49.733 --> 00:45:52.567
bewildering thing that is going
on between the dietitian

00:45:52.567 --> 00:45:54.700
and the man who is
in her room.

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.200
And then all of a sudden he
throws up and the dietitian

00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.800
realizes that there's someone
hiding in her closet.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.700
So this is what happens when
she's furious to know that she

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:05.133
and the other man, that the
two of them are not

00:46:05.133 --> 00:46:06.400
alone in the room.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.567
"When the curtain fled back
he did not look up.

00:46:09.567 --> 00:46:13.533
When hands dragged him violently
out of his vomit he

00:46:13.533 --> 00:46:18.400
did not resist. He hung from the
hands, limp, looking with

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:23.833
slackjawed and glassy idiocy
into a face no longer smooth

00:46:23.833 --> 00:46:27.900
pink-and-white, surrounded now
by wild and dishevelled hair

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.767
whose smooth bands once made
him think of candy. 'You

00:46:30.767 --> 00:46:35.333
little rat!' the thin, furious
voice hissed; 'you little rat!

00:46:35.333 --> 00:46:36.433
Spying on me!

00:46:36.433 --> 00:46:39.567
You little nigger bastard!'"

00:46:39.567 --> 00:46:43.933
So Joe has not really been--

00:46:43.933 --> 00:46:48.667
intially, when all of this
is happening, people have

00:46:48.667 --> 00:46:51.067
suspected there's something
maybe a little odd about his

00:46:51.067 --> 00:46:55.367
racial composition, but nobody
actually up to this point, at

00:46:55.367 --> 00:46:56.933
least nobody from the
administration--

00:46:56.933 --> 00:46:59.900
has called him black.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:04.700
And it's at this moment when
he is the unwitting,

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:11.633
involuntary, unintentional
witness to this scene that is

00:47:11.633 --> 00:47:16.467
unfolding in the dietitian's
room that that adjective is

00:47:16.467 --> 00:47:17.933
thrown at him.

00:47:17.933 --> 00:47:20.633
And everything about the
description, is that he's

00:47:20.633 --> 00:47:27.133
hanging from the hands of the
dietitian, he's witnessing a

00:47:27.133 --> 00:47:30.400
face that has completely
transformed, the recipient of

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:33.200
that hiss, that is
coming at him.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.633
Almost complete passivity
on his side.

00:47:36.633 --> 00:47:39.367
So that he really is the
template on which the

00:47:39.367 --> 00:47:44.300
dietitian is writing her own
furor and her own story.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:49.600
One more example, and this is
his relation to his adopted

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:52.567
father, McEachern.

00:47:52.567 --> 00:47:54.633
We have various ways to
pronounce that name.

00:47:54.633 --> 00:47:56.533
I'm just going to pronounce
it "McEach-ern," you can

00:47:56.533 --> 00:47:58.000
pronounce it any way you want.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.800
"Then the boy stood, his
trousers collapsed about his

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.833
feet, his legs revealed beneath
his brief shirt.

00:48:05.833 --> 00:48:08.267
He stood, slight and erect.

00:48:08.267 --> 00:48:13.067
When the strap fell he did
not flinch, no quiver

00:48:13.067 --> 00:48:14.933
passed over his face.

00:48:14.933 --> 00:48:20.600
He was looking straight ahead,
with a rapt, calm expression

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.167
like a monk in a picture."

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:26.933
So once again, this is not the
kind of uncontrolled violence

00:48:26.933 --> 00:48:29.967
that is coming from the
dietician, but the very

00:48:29.967 --> 00:48:35.667
disciplined violence that is
coming from his own foster

00:48:35.667 --> 00:48:38.000
father, adopted father.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.867
But no matter what kind of
violence, it can be either out

00:48:41.867 --> 00:48:45.400
of control, it can be totally
controlled, he is just there

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:51.400
like a saint, like a monk, just
totally calm, seemingly

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:53.033
untouched by that violence.

00:48:53.033 --> 00:48:57.633
And that's part of the
interesting fact about Joe

00:48:57.633 --> 00:48:58.967
Christmas, as well.

00:48:58.967 --> 00:49:07.333
It's almost as if there's so
little content to him--

00:49:07.333 --> 00:49:09.500
although I hesitate to say that,
because that doesn't

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.767
seem quite right, either.

00:49:10.767 --> 00:49:14.300
But whatever it is that is
lacking in him, there's no

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.233
lashing out from him.

00:49:16.233 --> 00:49:18.900
Even the killing is not really,
doesn't seem to be a

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:22.967
kind of a lashing out at
the way he's treated.

00:49:22.967 --> 00:49:30.000
So he seems to be as blank a
slate as possible, although

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.967
he's probably not as blank
a slate as Lena is.

00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:37.467
A lot more content than Lena,
but still a relatively blank

00:49:37.467 --> 00:49:42.767
slate on which a various
succession of characters write

00:49:42.767 --> 00:49:44.867
a very, very dramatic story.

00:49:44.867 --> 00:49:48.067
So this is the structure, and
that's why there's this very

00:49:48.067 --> 00:49:51.767
deep kinship between the two of
them, even though they are

00:49:51.767 --> 00:49:53.000
totally different.

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:02.567
J.MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK. 

00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:08.533
So more today about the lore of
acids and acid derivatives, 

00:00:08.533 --> 00:00:11.600
which you'll find in chapter 17,
18. 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.967
We'll get on, maybe at the end,
to chapter 19, but 

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:18.900
probably that's for Friday. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.367
At the end last time, we were
talking about having an R 

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:28.000
minus, that is an organometallic
molecule react 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.233
with an acid, and showed that,
of course, the first thing it 

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:34.367
does is act as a base, not as a
nucleophile, and pull off 

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.500
the proton. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.733
But even at that stage, it's
possible for another one to 

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:42.600
come in and add to the carbon
oxygen double bond to give 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.767
this di-salt. 

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.400
And then when this is hydrolyzed
at the end of the 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.300
day, you get a ketone, so you
could convert an acid to a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.967
ketone that way. 

00:00:52.967 --> 00:00:55.167
But it's difficult. 

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:59.567
Because sometimes, it's not
possible to 

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:00.900
do it in two stages. 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.467
Here you stopped at the
dilithium salt. 

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:09.500
Then you got rid of the R minus
when you added acid and 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.867
got the ketone. 

00:01:10.867 --> 00:01:14.267
But in the case of using
hydride, rather than R minus, 

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:17.200
as the base nucleophile, again
you 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.200
first make the salt. 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.967
But the second time around, you
can get the aluminum, 

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:26.067
also, as the salt of the oxygen.

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:29.933
And when you have that, that's
not a bad leaving group. 

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:33.300
It's better than the O-lithium,
the O-aluminum. 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.467
So that it's possible to do an
elimination reaction where the 

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:41.733
electrons of the lithium-oxygen
bond, or the oxygen 

00:01:41.733 --> 00:01:47.167
anion, help push out the
aluminum-oxygen anion, so that 

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:49.533
in situ, while you're doing the
reaction, 

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:51.900
it forms the aldehyde. 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.733
Bear in mind in the first step,
in the first reaction, 

00:01:54.733 --> 00:01:57.833
when we used the alkyl lithium,
we got the carbonyl 

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.833
group back only after adding
acid. 

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:04.267
Here it forms again while the
reaction is going on. 

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:06.800
And of course, aldehydes are
reactive with 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.667
lithium aluminum hydride. 

00:02:08.667 --> 00:02:11.100
So you don't stop at the
carbonyl. 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.767
You go all the way to the
alcohol adding two Hs. 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.700
We'll see a little bit later
ways to try to control that. 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.600
Now, decarboxylation is another
interesting reaction 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.900
of carboxylic acids, and in
particular, of diacids, like 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.933
malonic acid, which has two acid
groups attached to the 

00:02:35.933 --> 00:02:37.167
same carbon. 

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:41.467
This is this scheme that
Mitsunobu used in his paper to 

00:02:41.467 --> 00:02:45.633
talk about making the compound
at the bottom right that we 

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:50.767
discussed last time or the time
before that. 

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:53.733
Now remember, first he got this
compound by forming that 

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:55.433
carbon-carbon bond. 

00:02:55.433 --> 00:03:00.867
And it has two esters and a CN
triple bond, but we said that 

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:04.600
it was possible to convert the
ester into an acid. 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.433
We'll talk about this a little
bit more. 

00:03:06.433 --> 00:03:10.500
And the other ester into an
acid, and the cyanide, also, 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.800
the nitrile group, into an acid.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.433
Now, I've drawn that acid in an
interesting 

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.367
conformation here. 

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:19.000
Because you see a possibility--

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.533
this doesn't happen when you
have the anion, but when you 

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:29.000
have the protonated carboxylate,
and you have two 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.833
of them, it's possible to do
this reaction. 

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:34.967
So you use these electrons to
form a bond to that hydrogen. 

00:03:34.967 --> 00:03:37.667
These go here, these go down
here. 

00:03:37.667 --> 00:03:41.000
What's the product at the top
from this cycle? 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.800
Can you see what it is? 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.133
What did the carbon at the top
become? 

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:48.167
Carbon dioxide. 

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:50.100
PROFESSOR: Carbon dioxide,
right. 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.867
So you have CO2. 

00:03:52.867 --> 00:03:53.867
That'll fly off. 

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.967
It's a decarboxylation. 

00:03:55.967 --> 00:03:57.967
And you're left with this, which
is an enol. 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.333
And of course, that can undergo
an allylic 

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:07.567
rearrangement to the ketone form
of the enol, 

00:04:07.567 --> 00:04:09.800
and the H go on here. 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.400
And then you have the product. 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.900
So when you have two carboxyl
groups on the same carbon, and 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.667
it's protonated so that you can
do this cyclic mechanism 

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:25.300
to transfer the proton, then you
can easily lose CO2 and do 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.900
a decarboxylation. 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.900
But there are other ways to do
decarboxylations from acid. 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.200
The CO2 could be a leaving group
also from XCO2 minus, 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.567
where X is something that can
tolerate a negative charge, or 

00:04:39.567 --> 00:04:43.300
from the RCO2 radical. 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.033
So for example, carbonic acid,
the hydrate of CO2. 

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:53.233
If it's an acid; it's also a
base. 

00:04:53.233 --> 00:04:57.800
So if you get this form, then
you can see how it can undergo 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.967
decarboxylation. 

00:04:58.967 --> 00:05:02.300
So that's just the reverse of
the hydration of CO2. 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.800
So carbonic acid and CO2 go back
and forth. 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.367
So that's a case where the X can
leave 

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:12.933
with an unshared pair. 

00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:17.300
Or carbamic acid, where it's
nitrogen that does the trick, 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.433
and you can see the same kind of
thing to get a 

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:20.667
decarboxylation. 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.500
Or we actually mentioned last
semester already Kolbe 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.167
electrolysis, where it's a free
radical that does it. 

00:05:29.167 --> 00:05:32.800
So you start with a carboxylate
anion, but you do 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.767
an oxidation to remove an
electron from it, which then 

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:38.200
makes this free radical. 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.733
But that free radical is
fabulously unstable when R 

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:43.300
is an alkyl group. 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.733
And it undergoes this shift of
the electrons-- single 

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:51.300
electrons, it's a radical
process-- which is fast. Even 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.867
at 4 Kelvin you can't see an ESR
spectrum of this thing. 

00:05:55.867 --> 00:05:57.933
Even at that very low
temperature it immediately 

00:05:57.933 --> 00:06:02.367
loses CO2 and gives the free
radical, 

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:03.100
even if it's not a 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.467
particularly stable free
radical. 

00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:09.667
So you remember Kolbe used that,
unbeknownst to 

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:11.667
him, to make R2. 

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.200
R2 was ethane, remember? 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.000
He thought he had made the
methyl, but once molecular 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.233
weights were determinable, it
turned out that he actually 

00:06:20.233 --> 00:06:23.100
had the dimer, ethane. 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.700
And in fact that reaction can
work fairly well 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.967
synthetically, to take two
acids, knock out two CO2s, and 

00:06:29.967 --> 00:06:32.133
have the Rs come together. 

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:34.067
That was done in 1848. 

00:06:34.067 --> 00:06:39.000
But in 1973, they got a 50%
yield by doing electrolysis 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.633
that generates this free radical
by losing CO2 from it, 

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:45.800
and the dimer was formed. 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.100
OK. 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.900
So there are examples of
decarboxylation. 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.500
But, also there's another one
that's interesting. 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.400
Which is to treat an acid with
silver oxide, which gives a 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.900
silver salt of the acid. 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:05.400
Then if you treat that with
bromine, you get R-Br. 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.900
So you can convert a carboxylic
acid to the alkyl 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.433
bromide with one less carbon
atom. 

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:16.600
A decarboxylation has been
involved. 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.300
And it's pretty easy to see how
that would work. 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.467
If you react the salt with Br2,
the O minus can do a 

00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:27.567
nucleophilic substitution on
bromine with bromide leaving 

00:07:27.567 --> 00:07:32.833
to give this brominated
intermediate. 

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:37.267
But now, if you have a free
radical in there, it can 

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:41.100
attack the bromine to form the
R-Br bond and generate this 

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:44.100
radical, which, as we've already
seen, immediately 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:49.533
loses CO2 and gives-- so we have
a free radical chain that 

00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:56.900
allows this brominated acid to
become RBr. 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.433
Now, this reaction-- 

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:02.467
to convert an acid to an alkyl
bromide-- 

00:08:02.467 --> 00:08:05.333
is called the Hunsdiecker
reaction, for a sort of 

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:08.133
curious reason, it seems to me.

00:08:08.133 --> 00:08:13.567
Between 1936 and 1944, the
Hunsdieckers, husband and 

00:08:13.567 --> 00:08:18.300
wife, published, I think,
something like six patents for 

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.300
doing this, and one paper in the
open literature. 

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:29.333
But in fact, the same reaction
had been done in 1861 and 

00:08:29.333 --> 00:08:34.100
published in a leading German
journal, Annalen, by Alexander 

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.200
Porfiryevich Borodin, who was
obviously much earlier than 

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.700
the Hunsdieckers. 

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:44.100
This is his tomb in Saint
Petersburg. 

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:47.800
And notice that it doesn't have
anything about doing this 

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.333
reaction on it, 

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:50.700
because he was not only a
chemist, 

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:53.400
he was also a musician. 

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.467
So can you-- 

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.267
I know some of you are good
musicians. 

00:08:56.267 --> 00:08:58.433
Can you see what this line is,
up at the top? 

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.100
What is it? 

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.400
STUDENT: The Polovtsian Dances.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.867
PROFESSOR: Polovtsian Dances by

00:09:04.867 --> 00:09:07.000
Borodin, from Prince Igor. 

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.700
And in fact, although he didn't
get any recognition in 

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.200
terms of the reaction being
named for him-- these people 

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.000
that came along 75 years later
got the credit-- 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.433
he did get a posthumous Tony
award. 

00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:21.667
Because that tune, you know-- 

00:09:21.667 --> 00:09:21.900
[SINGS] 

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.833
dah dah dah dah dah dah dah dah
dah dah dah-- 

00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:29.967
is the theme of the musical
Kismet. 

00:09:29.967 --> 00:09:33.333
So he came out OK, anyhow. 

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:33.667
OK. 

00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:37.800
But now, when we think about--
so here's a way to take RCO2 

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.967
and make it into RBr. 

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:40.800
Right? 

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.600
When you're thinking about
possibilities of synthesis, 

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.633
you should think about, is there
a way to 

00:09:45.633 --> 00:09:47.233
go the other direction? 

00:09:47.233 --> 00:09:52.100
To start with RBRrand go to the
acid with 

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.433
one additional carbon? 

00:09:53.433 --> 00:09:55.767
So can you add a carbon to do
that? 

00:09:55.767 --> 00:09:59.033
Can anybody think of a way of
doing that? 

00:09:59.033 --> 00:10:05.267
To take RBr and substitute the
Br with an acid group, CO2, 

00:10:05.267 --> 00:10:06.967
put another carbon on the chain?

00:10:09.933 --> 00:10:11.933
We'll actually talk about this
some more later. 

00:10:11.933 --> 00:10:16.633
But we had shown an example that
if you have cyanide-- 

00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:21.100
which is a nucleophile, so you
could do an SN2 reaction, put 

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.367
cyanide there-- 

00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:25.567
but cyanide has the same
oxidation state of the carbon 

00:10:25.567 --> 00:10:26.500
as the acid does. 

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.367
So just treating it with water,
and either acid or 

00:10:29.367 --> 00:10:32.000
base-- and we'll talk about this
little later on-- and heat 

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.600
can do that. 

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.800
So you can go either direction.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.900
You can take the acid to the
bromide, or the 

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.433
bromide to the acid. 

00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:39.033
And that's not the only way. 

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:42.600
Notice that this involves the R
being R plus, the thing with 

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.333
the LUMO, the sigma* that gets
attacked by the cyanide. 

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:49.500
But there's another way to start
with RBr 

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.867
where R is R minus. 

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:56.367
It's a HOMO that does the
attacking. 

00:10:56.367 --> 00:11:00.433
So how would you convert RBr
into something that's like R 

00:11:00.433 --> 00:11:04.600
minus, something that has a high
HOMO? 

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:10.133
Under what circumstances does R
behave like R minus, is it 

00:11:10.133 --> 00:11:11.833
associated with a high HOMO? 

00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:14.333
STUDENT: With a halogen? 

00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:16.000
PROFESSOR: When it's associated
with a halogen, 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.800
it's a low LUMO, right? 

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.300
And it's the sigma*. 

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.700
But how can you get the stigma
to be high energy? 

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.300
STUDENT: Use a Grignard reagent.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:30.200
PROFESSOR: A Grignard reagent! 

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.800
So if you want R minus, you make
a Grignard reagent. 

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.500
And now you have to react that
in order to get an acid. 

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.567
What will you react it with? 

00:11:38.567 --> 00:11:40.400
What will it attack in order to
put the 

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.067
carbon and oxygens on? Ruoyi? 

00:11:42.067 --> 00:11:49.600
STUDENT: Carbon Dioxide. 

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.267
PROFESSOR: Carbon dioxide. 

00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:52.567
It's exactly the reverse of the
reaction we're talking 

00:11:52.567 --> 00:11:53.900
about here. 

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.833
So you bring carbon dioxide in,
you get the salt, treat it 

00:11:57.833 --> 00:11:58.733
with acid, and you do it. 

00:11:58.733 --> 00:12:03.633
So there are many ways to skin
these cats. 

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:04.300
OK. 

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:07.700
So we're talking about acid
derivatives. 

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.167
We've just been talking about
acids. 

00:12:10.167 --> 00:12:12.300
But acid derivatives are things
where you have some 

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:19.800
other group there, X, with an
unshared pair, not OH. 

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.800
So one example that's called an
acid derivative is a 

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:27.533
nitrile, that we just talked
about. 

00:12:27.533 --> 00:12:29.433
Another one is a ketene. 

00:12:29.433 --> 00:12:32.700
Now let's think about how these
are regarded as acid 

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:33.700
derivatives. 

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.767
There, as we just mentioned in
the last slide, the carbon has 

00:12:36.767 --> 00:12:40.433
a +3 oxidation level, because X
is electronegative, 

00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:42.433
something with the unshared pair
there. 

00:12:42.433 --> 00:12:45.100
And in nitrile, it's also +3. 

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.667
So you can go between these
things and acid just by 

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:50.900
treating them like water. 

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.067
Although you may need catalysts
and a high 

00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:54.600
temperature in order to do it. 

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.800
Nitriles are not so easy to do.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:02.533
Remember he refluxed it for 24
hours or something like that, 

00:13:02.533 --> 00:13:05.533
Mitsunobu did, in order to do
this. 

00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:05.867
OK. 

00:13:05.867 --> 00:13:06.767
That's fine. 

00:13:06.767 --> 00:13:10.367
But over here, the carbon is +2
in 

00:13:10.367 --> 00:13:11.533
its oxidation level. 

00:13:11.533 --> 00:13:15.233
It doesn't look like you're
dealing with the same thing. 

00:13:15.233 --> 00:13:18.900
However, this other carbon is
-2. 

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:24.800
And if you go to the acid, it's
-3, +3. 

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.967
So it's, again, no change in
overall oxidation level. 

00:13:28.967 --> 00:13:31.867
So you don't need an
oxidizing/reducing agent,

00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:33.533
and you can just 
do that with water. 

00:13:33.533 --> 00:13:36.400
So ketene will react with water
to give 

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:37.400
a carboxylic acid. 

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.833
So all these things are called
acid derivatives. 

00:13:41.833 --> 00:13:43.833
First, just a word about the
spectroscopy. 

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:47.333
In fact, I'll go in about three
seconds through the 

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:48.633
first slide, because we've
already 

00:13:48.633 --> 00:13:50.267
done it in some detail. 

00:13:50.267 --> 00:13:52.100
Remember, we looked at carbonyl
stretching 

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.200
frequencies in the IR, and saw
that aldehydes and ketones 

00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.200
were similar, but the amide was
much lower frequency, 

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.033
because of the unshared pair on
the nitrogen being 

00:14:03.033 --> 00:14:07.867
involved stabilized by the
carbon oxygen pi*, and 

00:14:07.867 --> 00:14:10.333
therefore weakening it to make
it a weak bond. 

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:15.700
But in the case of the ester the
bond was, in fact, 

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:17.100
strengthened a bit. 

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:18.967
And the case of acid chloride,
it was 

00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:20.400
strengthened quite a bit. 

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.333
And that the reason for that was
that you could get this 

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:26.633
other curious resonance
structure. 

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.800
So we already did this, and I'm
not spending any time just 

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.433
reminding you of it. 

00:14:31.433 --> 00:14:37.867
The one thing I'll talk about
that's new is the anhydride, 

00:14:37.867 --> 00:14:41.133
which is of course an acid
derivative where the X group 

00:14:41.133 --> 00:14:46.833
that's attached to the carbonyl
is another acid. 

00:14:46.833 --> 00:14:50.400
So here we see an IR spectrum,
and here is the percent 

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.167
transmission. 

00:14:53.167 --> 00:14:55.633
So this is very little light
getting through. 

00:14:55.633 --> 00:14:59.400
A strong absorption means a
small number here. 

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.833
And if we look in this region,
here's the carbonyl region, we 

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:05.367
see that there are two peaks,
which isn't surprising, 

00:15:05.367 --> 00:15:07.433
because there are two carbonyls.

00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:11.367
There's one at 1819, which is
very strong, and another one 

00:15:11.367 --> 00:15:15.733
at 1750, which is considerably
weaker. 

00:15:15.733 --> 00:15:20.767
Now two carbonyls, two IR
frequencies, two IR peaks. 

00:15:20.767 --> 00:15:22.400
That seems to make sense. 

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.900
Except that it's symmetrical. 

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.467
Wouldn't you expect them to be
the same? 

00:15:29.167 --> 00:15:31.100
STUDENT: There's an asymmetrical
frequency. 

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.500
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:32.867
STUDENT: There's an asymmetrical
frequency. 

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:35.700
PROFESSOR: OK. 

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.267
So they couple. 

00:15:38.267 --> 00:15:41.333
They could either both be
stretching at the same time, 

00:15:41.333 --> 00:15:44.667
or one can be stretching while
the other's shrinking. 

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:47.800
And if they're close enough
together, separated only by 

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.733
one oxygen, they can interact
mechanically one another, and 

00:15:51.733 --> 00:15:53.400
one of those is easier than the
other. 

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.433
So there are two normal modes,
both involve 

00:15:57.433 --> 00:15:59.300
both of the CO bonds. 

00:15:59.300 --> 00:15:59.833
Right? 

00:15:59.833 --> 00:16:02.200
And we can understand how it
would be. 

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.100
Because if they're in phase,
both stretching at the same 

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:08.667
time, then the light will
interact very 

00:16:08.667 --> 00:16:11.000
strongly with it. 

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.500
Because both of them were being
stretched by the same 

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:16.267
direction of the electric field
of the light. 

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:19.800
And it turns out that that's
difficult to do. 

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.267
It's difficult to stretch them
both at the same time. 

00:16:22.267 --> 00:16:24.333
It's better to have one stretch
when the other 

00:16:24.333 --> 00:16:26.500
shrinks, in terms of energy. 

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:27.967
So this one is hard to do. 

00:16:27.967 --> 00:16:29.900
That means it's at high
frequency. 

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:35.800
But it's quite intense, because
they're both going the 

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.067
same direction. 

00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:40.333
The other normal mode would have
one going up while the 

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:41.867
other's going down. 

00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:45.233
Now, if they were strictly
parallel, there would be no 

00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:47.500
net interaction with the light
for that. 

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.067
But if they're twisted a little
bit, or splayed out a 

00:16:51.067 --> 00:16:54.100
little bit, then there will be
some interaction with light. 

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:56.333
They won't exactly cancel one
another. 

00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:57.533
And that's what happens here. 

00:16:57.533 --> 00:17:00.433
So you have a strong peak where
they're both stretching 

00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:03.733
at the same time, and a weaker
peak where one is stretching 

00:17:03.733 --> 00:17:06.667
and the other is shrinking. 

00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:10.033
Now, if you compare that with
this cyclic imide, which is 

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:13.133
another acid derivative where
nitrogen is attached to the 

00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:17.233
acyl group, and now we look at
the peaks here, and you see a 

00:17:17.233 --> 00:17:20.100
strong peak at low frequency and
a weak 

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.933
peak at high frequency. 

00:17:21.933 --> 00:17:24.233
So it's exactly the opposite. 

00:17:24.233 --> 00:17:25.700
Can you see why it would be the
opposite? 

00:17:32.533 --> 00:17:35.567
Because now, when they both
stretch at the same time... when

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:38.733
one stretches and the other
shrinks, the oxygens are 

00:17:38.733 --> 00:17:40.467
moving in the same direction. 

00:17:40.467 --> 00:17:42.700
So they're both being pushed the
way light 

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.200
wants them to go. 

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.133
So that one, which is now the
easy one to do, where you 

00:17:49.133 --> 00:17:52.267
stretch one and shrink the
other, is now very strong. 

00:17:52.267 --> 00:17:54.233
It interacts strongly with
light. 

00:17:54.233 --> 00:17:56.900
But the one where they're
in-phase, here,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:57.867
is now very weak. 

00:17:57.867 --> 00:18:00.500
They nearly cancel one another.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.800
That's just an interesting
additional 

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.533
example of IR coupling. 

00:18:07.533 --> 00:18:11.500
But it helps you see how you use
the IR to interpret stuff 

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:15.233
about structure, as to whether
two carbonyls are parallel or 

00:18:15.233 --> 00:18:18.533
antiparallel most of the time. 

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:21.533
OK, now, the interconversion,
the chemistry of the acid 

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.667
derivatives. 

00:18:23.667 --> 00:18:27.733
So the idea is that some
nucleophile comes in and forms 

00:18:27.733 --> 00:18:32.567
the bond, and then the other one
leaves. 

00:18:32.567 --> 00:18:34.333
So that's a substitution. 

00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:37.333
But of course, it involves a
tetrahedral intermediate. 

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:39.167
It's not like SN2. 

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:43.467
You actually have an association
to give it a 

00:18:43.467 --> 00:18:46.700
stable intermediate, followed by
dissociation. 

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.967
So it's not a pentavalent
transition state. 

00:18:48.967 --> 00:18:51.567
It's a tetrahedral, tetravalent
carbon 

00:18:51.567 --> 00:18:53.900
intermediate. 

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.067
Now, which group will leave from
that 

00:18:56.067 --> 00:18:57.967
intermediate, X or Y? 

00:18:57.967 --> 00:19:00.067
Well, there's a hierarchy of
these things. 

00:19:00.067 --> 00:19:03.333
The easiest thing to leave is
chloride, then carboxylic 

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:09.800
acid, then an alcohol anion,
then a nitrogen anion. 

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.100
And you can see why this would
be. 

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:16.100
Why so? 

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.767
Because that's the order of
stability 

00:19:17.767 --> 00:19:19.100
of the anions, right? 

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.233
As exemplified in the pKa. 

00:19:22.233 --> 00:19:28.767
So if you could make the most
energetic one, the top one, 

00:19:28.767 --> 00:19:32.000
the acid chloride, then by
adding the others 

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.500
successively, you could make it
into any of the other 

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.933
three; or the next one, the acid
anhydride, into either of 

00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:45.600
the other two; or the ester into
the amide, and so on. 

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.900
So the important thing is to get
up at the top of the 

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.300
ladder at the beginning. 

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.167
And you can do that. 

00:19:50.167 --> 00:19:54.200
The same way you converted
alcohol to RCl, you can 

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.233
convert an acid to the acid
chloride by using SOCl2. 

00:19:59.233 --> 00:20:04.333
And, as I was saying, out of
order before, this order of 

00:20:04.333 --> 00:20:07.267
the hierarchy is clear because
of the pKas. 

00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:12.300
They're in the order of the
stability of the anions. 

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.700
But it's not just the stability
of the anions that 

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:16.400
makes them have that order. 

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:21.100
Because as we saw before, you
get resonance stabilization of 

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:25.467
the electrons that are on Y.
That is, whatever this group 

00:20:25.467 --> 00:20:28.567
is here, chlorine, oxygen,
oxygen, nitrogen. 

00:20:28.567 --> 00:20:29.400
Right? 

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.867
Those electrons are stabilized
by the vacant orbital here, as 

00:20:32.867 --> 00:20:35.867
denoted by these resonance
structures. 

00:20:35.867 --> 00:20:38.333
So even if you didn't have the
question of the stability of 

00:20:38.333 --> 00:20:42.467
the anions, the stability of the
derivatives would 

00:20:42.467 --> 00:20:43.733
still be the same. 

00:20:43.733 --> 00:20:47.967
It likes most to be with
nitrogen, because it can get 

00:20:47.967 --> 00:20:50.933
the special stability from
stabilizing the high energy 

00:20:50.933 --> 00:20:52.833
electrons of the nitrogen. 

00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:55.467
It's lower if it's an oxygen. 

00:20:55.467 --> 00:20:59.033
It's still lower if it's a
carboxylate group, because 

00:20:59.033 --> 00:21:01.933
although it's an oxygen's
unshared pair, as in the case 

00:21:01.933 --> 00:21:07.000
of alcohol, that electron pair
on that oxygen is already 

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.400
stabilized by its own carbonyl
group. 

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.167
So it's not as available for
being 

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:14.967
stabilized by the one here. 

00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:18.667
So this one is not as stable as
that, this one is not as 

00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:19.800
stable as that. 

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.833
And what that means is, you
don't have to do this with 

00:21:22.833 --> 00:21:26.000
base in order to get these
anions, in order to have this 

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.500
reactivity scale. 

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.767
You could do the same thing if
you had acid catalyzed. 

00:21:31.767 --> 00:21:33.933
And we've already seen it in the
case of Fischer 

00:21:33.933 --> 00:21:39.333
esterification, where now it's a
question 

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:41.500
of alcohol and water. 

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.967
That is, are you going to put on
OR, or are you 

00:21:43.967 --> 00:21:46.033
going to put on OH? 

00:21:46.033 --> 00:21:49.600
And we've gone through the acid
catalyzed mechanism of 

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:52.300
Fischer esterification, which
converts OH to 

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:54.900
OR, or OR to OH. 

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:59.033
And you can also do
transesterification. 

00:21:59.033 --> 00:22:03.033
You can take one ester and a
different alcohol and have 

00:22:03.033 --> 00:22:06.833
the OR' replace OR", or
something like that. 

00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:09.700
You can go back and forth from
one ester to the other. 

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.100
But the equilibrium constant for
this acid-catalyzed 

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.533
process is one. 

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:17.867
There's not much difference
among the different Rs. 

00:22:17.867 --> 00:22:20.733
But you make it go the way you
want in a Fischer 

00:22:20.733 --> 00:22:23.400
esterification by using the law
of mass action. 

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.733
You put in a whole bunch of
alcohol, then 

00:22:25.733 --> 00:22:28.067
you get that ester. 

00:22:28.067 --> 00:22:30.700
Or you put in a whole bunch of
water, and then you get the 

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.167
carboxylic acid. 

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:40.400
So going back and forth between
ester and acid also is 

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.800
very much like these
transesterifications. 

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.500
But if you use base, it's a
different story. 

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:52.600
So you could have hydroxide come
in and OR minus go out. 

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:53.533
That's fine. 

00:22:53.533 --> 00:22:56.700
And it looks like it should be
an equilibrium 

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.433
constant of about one. 

00:22:58.433 --> 00:23:01.967
But in fact, this reaction has a
special name, 

00:23:01.967 --> 00:23:03.800
saponification, 

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.933
and it has an equilibrium
constant much 

00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:07.833
greater than one. 

00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:11.167
Now, why should there be a
difference between OR and OH, 

00:23:11.167 --> 00:23:13.567
an enormous difference? 

00:23:13.567 --> 00:23:16.267
It's because this isn't the end
of the line. 

00:23:16.267 --> 00:23:19.933
That OR minus that disappeared
can get back into the act. 

00:23:19.933 --> 00:23:21.200
In what way? 

00:23:24.167 --> 00:23:26.333
Sebastian? 

00:23:26.333 --> 00:23:27.800
STUDENT: Lose the hydrogen. 

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:28.167
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:23:28.167 --> 00:23:32.267
This is not called an acid for
nothing. 

00:23:32.267 --> 00:23:36.433
So it can transfer the proton to
the OR minus. 

00:23:36.433 --> 00:23:38.733
And now that's very favorable. 

00:23:38.733 --> 00:23:43.167
Because the pKa of the acid is
about 5, the pKa of a typical 

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:45.367
alcohol is about 16. 

00:23:45.367 --> 00:23:48.900
So they differ by 11 orders of
magnitude. 

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.667
That means the equilibrium
constant is about 10 to the 

00:23:51.667 --> 00:23:55.400
11th, when you factor in that
you that you don't stop 

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.333
at the acid, but go to the anion
of the 

00:23:57.333 --> 00:24:00.633
acid, and to the alcohol. 

00:24:00.633 --> 00:24:04.233
Now, why does this thing have a
special name, 

00:24:04.233 --> 00:24:06.833
saponification, this particular

00:24:06.833 --> 00:24:08.767
substitution reaction? 

00:24:08.767 --> 00:24:13.600
Because you have these things
called triglycerides, which 

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:18.900
are long chain acids attached as
esters to a 

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.367
three carbon unit. 

00:24:21.367 --> 00:24:25.100
You know what else you call
those things besides 

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.233
triglycerides? 

00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:27.267
STUDENT: Fats. 

00:24:27.267 --> 00:24:29.933
PROFESSOR: Fats. 

00:24:29.933 --> 00:24:34.033
And if you treat fat with lye,
you're doing something that's 

00:24:34.033 --> 00:24:38.267
been known through millennia. 

00:24:38.267 --> 00:24:39.033
Right? 

00:24:39.033 --> 00:24:42.733
Because lye is what you get when
you take the ashes from a 

00:24:42.733 --> 00:24:47.333
fire and filter water through
it, and then 

00:24:47.333 --> 00:24:48.500
evaporate the water. 

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.033
You know what you get? 

00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:52.300
What lye is? 

00:24:54.867 --> 00:24:56.133
It's potassium hydroxide. 

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.633
So treat it with KOH, and you
have this reaction take 

00:25:02.633 --> 00:25:06.533
place. So you get carboxylic
acids, long-chain carboxylic 

00:25:06.533 --> 00:25:09.900
acids, and you get alcohols on
all those three. 

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.133
So these long-chain fatty acids,
the salts of them, the 

00:25:14.133 --> 00:25:15.867
potassium salts, are called
what? 

00:25:19.333 --> 00:25:22.000
Why is it called saponification?

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.233
What's savon or sapone, right? 

00:25:25.233 --> 00:25:25.267
STUDENT: Soap. 

00:25:25.267 --> 00:25:27.000
PROFESSOR: It's soap. 

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.467
So that's how soap was made. 

00:25:29.467 --> 00:25:31.867
And still is made. 

00:25:31.867 --> 00:25:36.433
And that stuff is called
glycerin, that trialcohol. 

00:25:36.433 --> 00:25:40.333
Now, there's a very interesting
book about lore in 

00:25:40.333 --> 00:25:43.400
the Appalachian mountains called
The Foxfire Book. 

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.767
Has anybody seen that? 

00:25:44.767 --> 00:25:47.400
There was a movie made from it a
long time ago, actually. 

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:53.833
But a bunch of high school
English students had the project

00:25:53.833 --> 00:25:56.200
of going out and talking to
people who knew how to do 

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.800
things, and then writing the
traditional lore. 

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.500
And one of the people they
talked to was the grandmother 

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.400
of one of the girls, whose name
was Pearl Martin, 

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:06.800
and who made soap. 

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.967
And so she showed the girls--
she had a big kettle, and put 

00:26:09.967 --> 00:26:13.967
in lard, and put in lye, and
stirred it up. 

00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:18.733
And she says, there, now the
soap's making, and so on. 

00:26:18.733 --> 00:26:21.433
And so she got the soap out, and
she said, you know,

00:26:21.433 --> 00:26:22.967
"I could wash my hair in it."

00:26:22.967 --> 00:26:26.933
And the girls were astounded
that she would wash her hair 

00:26:26.933 --> 00:26:31.100
in this stuff that 
came from lie. 

00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:36.400
But she said, "I ain't afraid to
wash my hair in it." 

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:41.700
She said, "That there 
lard eats the lye." 

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.400
What did she mean by that? 

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.433
She, of course, hadn't studied
chemistry, at least I don't 

00:26:45.433 --> 00:26:47.733
believe, although she had very
good practical 

00:26:47.733 --> 00:26:48.900
knowledge of it. 

00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:51.467
That she knew that she could
wash her hair with this stuff, 

00:26:51.467 --> 00:26:53.767
even though you put lye in it. 

00:26:53.767 --> 00:26:57.200
The girls were dumbfounded at
this. 

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:00.800
But the reason is that the lard
"ate" the lye. 

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:05.333
The lye was like RO minus,
right? pKa of about 16. 

00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:08.333
But this last stage that makes
the reaction go makes it a 

00:27:08.333 --> 00:27:11.300
carboxylate with a pKa of only
5, so it 

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.000
doesn't hurt your hair. 

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.200
So there's some tradition for
you. 

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:24.600
Now, an interesting question is,
what happens when the 

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.600
nucleophile is R minus, or H
minus, rather 

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:31.900
than these other things? 

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.667
So I'm going to put a little bit
of this on the board. 

00:27:34.667 --> 00:27:36.300
And there's a-- 

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:39.033
see, I should put this up, put
this thing over 

00:27:39.033 --> 00:27:41.933
on the other screen. 

00:27:41.933 --> 00:27:45.100
Actually, it's supposed to be
there. 

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.367
Yeah, there it is. 

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.867
So let me put this up-- 

00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:01.567
get some light here. 

00:28:16.667 --> 00:28:17.600
OK. 

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:28.367
So what if you have R minus or H
minus as the nucleophile? 

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:40.067
So suppose we start, and these
are for reactions with acid 

00:28:40.067 --> 00:28:41.500
derivatives. 

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.200
Suppose we use the acid
fluoride. 

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.400
Then if we use hydride, for
example, 

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.633
lithium aluminum hydride-- 

00:28:50.667 --> 00:28:55.000
so the AlH4 minus, high HOMO
there-- 

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.900
OK, so hydride can come in here.

00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.733
Put minus on the oxygen. 

00:28:59.733 --> 00:29:05.900
Chloride can leave. And we get
aldehyde. 

00:29:09.267 --> 00:29:14.433
But the reaction won't stop
there, because we already know 

00:29:14.433 --> 00:29:18.033
that aldehydes are reduced by
lithium aluminum hydride. 

00:29:18.033 --> 00:29:28.033
So we'll go on to put two
hydrogens on, and make this, 

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:34.000
and ultimately when you add an
acid, you'll get all the way 

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:42.900
to the alcohol, not just to the
aldehyde. 

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:46.000
So it's not just a substitution
of chloride by 

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.733
hydride, but you go on all the
way to the product. 

00:29:48.733 --> 00:29:54.267
Or if you have an alkyl lithium,
or an 

00:29:54.267 --> 00:29:55.900
alkyl magnesium bromide. 

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:00.067
You do the same kind of thing. 

00:30:00.067 --> 00:30:02.000
You get the-- 

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.667
now it would be a ketone first,
because 

00:30:03.667 --> 00:30:04.900
this is an R group. 

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:14.300
But again, you go on and get the
alcohol, having put on two 

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:15.600
new R groups. 

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.333
So if that's the kind of alcohol
you want, with two R 

00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:21.733
groups, there's two R groups of
the same kind that you can 

00:30:21.733 --> 00:30:27.567
get from an alkyl halide, then
that's a good way to do it. 

00:30:27.567 --> 00:30:36.900
Now, if you use an ester, I'll
just write, ditto. 

00:30:41.233 --> 00:30:44.033
If you react it with lithium
aluminum hydride,

00:30:44.033 --> 00:30:44.733
you get all the way 

00:30:44.733 --> 00:30:47.267
to the alcohol, replacing now
the OR minus, 

00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:48.533
instead of the Cl. 

00:30:48.533 --> 00:30:52.367
Or if you use alkyl lithium or
alkyl magnesium bromide, you 

00:30:52.367 --> 00:30:55.500
go all the way to the alcohol. 

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:01.500
In fact, a particularly
interesting one is to use two 

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:04.733
chlorines or two esters. 

00:31:11.367 --> 00:31:14.700
Can you see what would happen in
that case, if you reacted 

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:22.200
those with the hydride, or with
the R minus, an alkyl 

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:23.433
metal compound? 

00:31:26.767 --> 00:31:28.033
What's going to be different? 

00:31:33.533 --> 00:31:38.967
Well, if you went through, you
replace the chloride by R 

00:31:38.967 --> 00:31:43.033
minus, same kind of trick we're
doing here, or H minus. 

00:31:43.033 --> 00:31:45.400
Then you replace the other
chloride by 

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:48.133
H minus or R minus, 

00:31:48.133 --> 00:31:50.133
you get an aldehyde or a ketone.

00:31:50.133 --> 00:31:53.167
And then you add to the
carbonyl. 

00:31:53.167 --> 00:31:55.100
So now we put three groups on. 

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:05.067
So we have a COH at the end with
three R groups. 

00:32:05.067 --> 00:32:07.700
You could do the same thing with
the hydride, but there 

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.233
wouldn't be much point in making
methanol that way. 

00:32:10.233 --> 00:32:12.100
You're using expensive reagents
to 

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.500
make something cheap. 

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.900
But if you want something that
has three of the same R groups 

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.000
on it, that could be a practical
way 

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
of going about it. 

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:30.333
It's slightly different if
you're using an amide. 

00:32:37.733 --> 00:32:39.667
So suppose you use lithium
aluminum hydride. 

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.267
Now we'll get-- 

00:32:45.267 --> 00:32:48.000
just call this R, here. 

00:32:53.467 --> 00:33:01.500
So we have NH2 and H minus that
came in. 

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.700
Now, what we've done above is
then to lose this group that 

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.833
was originally there. 

00:33:06.833 --> 00:33:12.567
Lose chloride, or lose O minus,
RO minus. 

00:33:12.567 --> 00:33:15.933
But it's a little different
here. 

00:33:15.933 --> 00:33:23.633
Because with the aluminum salt
here, the aluminum helps make 

00:33:23.633 --> 00:33:25.733
this oxygen a better leaving
group than it 

00:33:25.733 --> 00:33:26.733
would otherwise be. 

00:33:26.733 --> 00:33:34.000
So instead of coming like this
and losing the nitrogen, what 

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.833
happens is the unshared pair
helps you lose the oxygen. 

00:33:40.667 --> 00:33:50.067
So the nitrogen is not lost.
It's still there, as N double- 

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:55.300
bond now, H, and two Hs on
there. 

00:33:59.933 --> 00:34:03.833
But now that's rather like a
carbonyl group, right? 

00:34:03.833 --> 00:34:07.067
So the H minus can get...the
lithium aluminum hydride can 

00:34:07.067 --> 00:34:08.300
get in the act again. 

00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:18.067
And the product from lithium
aluminum hydride reduction of 

00:34:18.067 --> 00:34:21.900
an amide is an amine. 

00:34:36.067 --> 00:34:36.400
OK. 

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.500
So now these are examples, then,
of going all 

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.367
the way to the COH. 

00:34:41.367 --> 00:34:44.133
The carbonyl is completely gone,
and you added two, or 

00:34:44.133 --> 00:34:47.433
in one case, three groups. 

00:34:47.433 --> 00:34:51.867
But you might actually want the
intermediate. 

00:34:51.867 --> 00:34:54.100
You might want the aldehyde. 

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:57.167
So the question arises, is there
a way to stop It, so you 

00:34:57.167 --> 00:35:00.733
can get that intermediate
product? 

00:35:00.733 --> 00:35:03.167
And you can do that. 

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:18.167
You can stop by tuning the
nucleophile, so that it's able 

00:35:18.167 --> 00:35:22.100
to react in the first reaction
but not reactive 

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:23.600
enough to react in the second. 

00:35:33.367 --> 00:35:35.900
So for example, instead of using
lithium aluminum 

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:44.867
hydride, use lithium aluminum
hydride but that instead of 

00:35:44.867 --> 00:35:49.433
having other hydrogens on it,
has O-t-butyl 

00:35:49.433 --> 00:35:54.000
taken three times. 

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.900
Now, there are two things about
having 

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.667
that in place of hydrogen. 

00:35:57.667 --> 00:36:00.867
The first is that the oxygen is
electron withdrawing. 

00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:03.133
It stabilizes anions. 

00:36:03.133 --> 00:36:06.533
So it makes the electrons here
that are going to be doing the 

00:36:06.533 --> 00:36:08.100
attacking-- 

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.533
the sigma electrons-- 

00:36:09.533 --> 00:36:13.233
it makes them lower in energy
and less reactive. 

00:36:13.233 --> 00:36:18.033
What else about having the
t-butyl group here would help 

00:36:18.033 --> 00:36:23.467
in mitigating the reactivity of
that tri-t-butoxy lithium 

00:36:23.467 --> 00:36:24.700
aluminum hydride? 

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.400
Rahul? 

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.300
STUDENT: Steric hindrance. 

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:31.600
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.667
It's big, so it's hard to
approach. 

00:36:33.667 --> 00:36:35.467
OK. 

00:36:35.467 --> 00:36:42.367
So it's reactive enough to take
the acid chloride to the 

00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:50.933
aldehyde, but not to take the
aldehyde in the second step. 

00:36:50.933 --> 00:36:53.400
But it's used at very low
temperature, at dry ice 

00:36:53.400 --> 00:37:00.200
temperature, so that that second
reaction won't happen. 

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:08.300
Or you can use, in a very
similar situation, a reagent 

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:09.533
called DIBAL. 

00:37:12.267 --> 00:37:15.667
Again, you use it at minus 78
degrees. 

00:37:15.667 --> 00:37:25.467
And it's again an aluminum
hydride, but now again, it 

00:37:25.467 --> 00:37:30.367
doesn't have the oxygens, but it
has two isobutyl groups 

00:37:30.367 --> 00:37:34.133
which, again, are big and help
tame it. 

00:37:34.133 --> 00:37:36.433
So that one can be used with the
ester. 

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.100
And take it over to the
aldehyde. 

00:37:47.933 --> 00:37:59.133
Or another way of getting from
the acid chloride and stopping 

00:37:59.133 --> 00:38:05.867
at the aldehyde is to do it with
H2 and a catalyst. 

00:38:05.867 --> 00:38:10.500
So the acid chloride, reduce it
to put H2 on 

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:12.267
the ends of the bond. 

00:38:16.067 --> 00:38:18.900
But of course, the aldehyde can
also be reduced. 

00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:23.233
So you tame the reactivity of
the catalyst by adding a 

00:38:23.233 --> 00:38:27.733
nitrogen-containing compound,
quinoline. 

00:38:27.733 --> 00:38:35.000
This is called the Rosenmund
procedure. 

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.133
We saw this before. 

00:38:36.133 --> 00:38:39.933
The idea of a catalytic
hydrogenation where are you 

00:38:39.933 --> 00:38:42.967
make the catalyst less reactive
in order to stop it. 

00:38:42.967 --> 00:38:45.333
Remember what that was, way back
when? 

00:38:45.333 --> 00:38:47.967
STUDENT: Acetylene to alkene. 

00:38:47.967 --> 00:38:49.567
PROFESSOR: Right. The 
Lindlar catalyst,

00:38:49.567 --> 00:38:51.233
where you wanted to
take a triple 

00:38:51.233 --> 00:38:54.367
bond and go just to a double
bond, but not from the double 

00:38:54.367 --> 00:38:55.300
bond to a single bond. 

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.433
It was, again, the case of
adding something that would 

00:38:58.433 --> 00:39:01.833
poison the catalyst. 

00:39:01.833 --> 00:39:07.067
And finally, just as a reminder,
it's possible to 

00:39:07.067 --> 00:39:12.333
have an acid chloride and react
it with a very, very 

00:39:12.333 --> 00:39:19.167
weak carbon nucleophile that
only will react if you soup up 

00:39:19.167 --> 00:39:24.233
the chloride by using AlCl3 to
help make that a 

00:39:24.233 --> 00:39:25.767
good leaving group. 

00:39:25.767 --> 00:39:32.433
Now you can use a really weak
carbon nucleophile, high HOMO 

00:39:32.433 --> 00:39:42.767
on carbon, that will react to
give the ketone, but won't 

00:39:42.767 --> 00:39:45.367
react with the ketone, because
it's so weak. 

00:39:45.367 --> 00:39:48.433
Here you did a special thing to
help make the chloride 

00:39:48.433 --> 00:39:50.100
reactive, but it doesn't help
make a 

00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.900
ketone you get reactive. 

00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.000
Remember what the nucleophile is
you used in this? 

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.700
An acyl chloride/AICI3? 

00:40:08.033 --> 00:40:09.300
What is it? 

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:19.833
Acylation. 

00:40:19.833 --> 00:40:24.000
So you could use benzene as the
nucleophile. 

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.467
We talked about it from the
point of view of something 

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:29.100
attacking benzene, but now we're
looking at 

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:29.767
it the other way. 

00:40:29.767 --> 00:40:32.433
Benzene attacking the something
else. 

00:40:32.433 --> 00:40:32.700
Right? 

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:36.533
So we make the aromatic ketone
that way, by 

00:40:36.533 --> 00:40:38.267
Friedel-Crafts acylation. 

00:40:38.267 --> 00:40:40.167
But again, it's a question where
you could do the first 

00:40:40.167 --> 00:40:43.233
one, but not the second one, by
tuning the reactivity of 

00:40:43.233 --> 00:40:46.667
the reagents. 

00:40:46.667 --> 00:40:48.967
OK. 

00:40:48.967 --> 00:40:53.433
Now acid-, base-hydrolysis of
RCN. 

00:40:53.433 --> 00:40:57.533
Let me just use the other board
here for a moment. 

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.500
So we talked before about
converting the CN to a 

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.600
carboxylic acid. 

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:14.367
And we can we can go through
acid- and base-catalyzed 

00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:16.500
mechanisms of doing that. 

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:20.467
It's very simple, and I've got a
blackboard realization of 

00:41:20.467 --> 00:41:23.533
that, just to trace through it
quickly. 

00:41:23.533 --> 00:41:28.967
So you have the nitrile, the CN
group. Protonated it. 

00:41:28.967 --> 00:41:30.133
You have a resonance structure,

00:41:30.133 --> 00:41:31.800
that has + on carbon. 

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.833
React that with water, so now
you've got the C-O bond. 

00:41:35.833 --> 00:41:40.900
Lose a proton, so you have the
alcohol here now. 

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.700
But then protonate the nitrogen.

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:47.000
Now we have this. 

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.233
But if you take a base and pull
off this proton, 

00:41:50.233 --> 00:41:52.467
you have the amide. 

00:41:52.467 --> 00:41:55.567
In other words, this is an
allylic rearrangement. 

00:41:55.567 --> 00:42:02.400
It's a hydrogen here that goes
to the other end of this 

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.367
double bond. 

00:42:05.367 --> 00:42:07.233
So you can get partway to the
acid. 

00:42:07.233 --> 00:42:10.300
You get from this acid
derivative to this acid 

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:11.533
derivative, the amide. 

00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:18.367
But now suppose you protonate
this back again and get to 

00:42:18.367 --> 00:42:24.100
this one, which I've redrawn
here, and have that carbon 

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.367
plus attacked by water. 

00:42:27.367 --> 00:42:31.367
So now a second water attacking
the carbon. 

00:42:31.367 --> 00:42:36.167
And take the proton off here,
and put it on the nitrogen, 

00:42:36.167 --> 00:42:40.567
and then have the NH3 leave with
the electrons. 

00:42:40.567 --> 00:42:44.500
You have this cation, lose a
proton, and now you're all the 

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.400
way to the carboxylic acid. 

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.667
So there are two stages of
substituting water here. 

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:55.767
First adding water to give the
amide, and then changing the 

00:42:55.767 --> 00:42:59.000
amide acid derivative into the
acid itself. 

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.700
So that's acid catalysis. 

00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.433
And I won't spend more time on
it now, but it would be good 

00:43:03.433 --> 00:43:05.867
for you to be able to do that. 

00:43:05.867 --> 00:43:09.300
But you can also do it with
base. 

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:13.667
So in base, you attack the CN
triple bond, as if it were a CO

00:43:13.667 --> 00:43:15.333
double bond. 

00:43:15.333 --> 00:43:19.967
Generate this, put a proton on,
and now do the allylic 

00:43:19.967 --> 00:43:23.700
rearrangement, the same thing we
did before, except that now 

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.600
instead of being acid-catalyzed,
it's base- 

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.167
catalyzed, so we're halfway
there. 

00:43:29.167 --> 00:43:34.067
We're to the amide, once we put
the last proton on. 

00:43:34.067 --> 00:43:38.367
And now we can go from the
amide, attack it, and then 

00:43:38.367 --> 00:43:43.300
lose the NH2, probably in a
protonated form. 

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.300
Then we have the carboxylic acid
and drive it all the way 

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.933
to completion in base, as in the
case of saponification, by 

00:43:50.933 --> 00:43:55.633
making the anion, the stable
carboxylate anion. 

00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:56.000
OK. 

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.433
So there, both acid and base
could be used. 

00:43:58.433 --> 00:43:59.767
But it's a hard reaction to do.

00:43:59.767 --> 00:44:01.500
It has to be heated a lot. 

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.133
And sometimes people even do it
using biological catalysts 

00:44:06.133 --> 00:44:11.100
to try to get it down to a lower
temperature. 

00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:19.200
Now, a ketene, we said, was
another acid derivative. 

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.633
So if you have an acid chloride
and react it with an 

00:44:21.633 --> 00:44:25.500
amine, we've just been talking
about reactions like this, 

00:44:25.500 --> 00:44:26.300
where the product-- 

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.933
you lose chloride, add nitrogen,
and the 

00:44:28.933 --> 00:44:30.967
product is an amide, 

00:44:30.967 --> 00:44:33.333
the carbonyl with nitrogen next
to it. 

00:44:33.333 --> 00:44:37.700
But this is a special case,
because there are three alkyl 

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.567
groups on the nitrogen. 

00:44:39.567 --> 00:44:42.267
Do you see how that makes it
special? 

00:44:42.267 --> 00:44:43.500
Ayesha? 

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.700
If you use the nitrogen as a
nucleophile, and attack, and 

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:53.767
chloride leaves, then you have N
plus. 

00:44:53.767 --> 00:44:54.000
Right? 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.633
Because you've used the unshared
pair to 

00:44:55.633 --> 00:44:57.433
make that new bond. 

00:44:57.433 --> 00:45:01.367
And normally, what would you do
with that N plus? 

00:45:01.367 --> 00:45:04.433
How would you get rid of the
charge? 

00:45:04.433 --> 00:45:04.467
STUDENT: Lose a proton. 

00:45:04.467 --> 00:45:07.067
PROFESSOR: Normally, you'd lose
a proton from the amine. 

00:45:07.067 --> 00:45:10.867
But this time, we used a
trialkyl amine, 

00:45:10.867 --> 00:45:12.400
so it can't do that. 

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.267
So in fact, it doesn't do it. 

00:45:16.767 --> 00:45:18.733
It probably attacks sometimes. 

00:45:18.733 --> 00:45:20.300
Chloride probably leaves. 

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.067
But chloride can come back and
the nitrogen leave, because it 

00:45:23.067 --> 00:45:25.433
couldn't become stable by losing
a proton. 

00:45:25.433 --> 00:45:27.533
So that probably goes on. 

00:45:27.533 --> 00:45:31.000
But another reaction could
happen instead, which is for 

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.633
the nitrogen base to attack a
proton here. 

00:45:34.633 --> 00:45:38.667
So you could do an elimination
reaction, lose HCl, and you 

00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:42.967
generate, then, ketene, this
funny molecule, which is sort 

00:45:42.967 --> 00:45:45.567
of an analog of CO2, 

00:45:45.567 --> 00:45:49.033
except instead of an oxygen, you
have CH2 group here. 

00:45:49.033 --> 00:45:52.700
Now, that group then could be
attacked by a nucleophile, the 

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.033
same way CO2 is attacked. 

00:45:55.033 --> 00:45:58.333
And now you have the nucleophile
attack, and that's 

00:45:58.333 --> 00:46:03.800
an enolate, so we could draw the
resonance form of it and 

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:08.667
we could put a proton on there
from the protonated 

00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:15.433
nucleophile and get the product,
plus the nucleophile 

00:46:15.433 --> 00:46:20.933
anion, which is now able to do
it to the next ketene. 

00:46:20.933 --> 00:46:21.933
OK. 

00:46:21.933 --> 00:46:25.567
So what we've done is convert a
ketene into an acid 

00:46:25.567 --> 00:46:29.267
derivative, depending on what
nucleophile we use. 

00:46:29.267 --> 00:46:31.133
And you can use lots of
different nucleophiles. 

00:46:31.133 --> 00:46:36.167
Here's, for example, taken from
that Jones textbook, is 

00:46:36.167 --> 00:46:38.000
sulfur as the nucleophile. 

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.967
This, they said, was done at dry
ice temperature for three 

00:46:40.967 --> 00:46:47.367
days, and gave a thioester in
93% yield. 

00:46:47.367 --> 00:46:50.733
Or instead of base-catalyzed
like this, it 

00:46:50.733 --> 00:46:52.733
could be aci-catalyzed. 

00:46:52.733 --> 00:46:56.267
So reaction with t-butyl alcohol
with acid. 

00:46:56.267 --> 00:47:00.900
So the acid can protonate the
oxygen, then this oxygen can 

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:04.233
attack, right, as the
nucleophile, lose the proton, 

00:47:04.233 --> 00:47:07.933
and you get t-butyl ester, 87%
yield. 

00:47:07.933 --> 00:47:11.267
Or you can use a nitrogen. 

00:47:11.267 --> 00:47:16.000
This is done in ethanol water,
and it gives a 75% yield. 

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.367
Of course, these other things
could've reacted. 

00:47:20.367 --> 00:47:24.767
The O minus, or the HO minus,
could have reacted 

00:47:24.767 --> 00:47:26.200
if it were in base. 

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.900
But it's probably, although it
isn't said so here, it's 

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:31.267
probably in acid. 

00:47:31.267 --> 00:47:35.767
So it's probably an
acid-catalyzed reaction. 

00:47:35.767 --> 00:47:41.067
Now, then you can have
insertions into acyl-R bonds. 

00:47:41.067 --> 00:47:44.267
Let me just start this, and
we'll finish it up next time. 

00:47:44.267 --> 00:47:45.833
So we'll talk about the first
reaction. 

00:47:45.833 --> 00:47:48.100
You remember this picture? 

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.500
Who's interesting in this
picture that we 

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:52.433
talked about before? 

00:47:52.433 --> 00:47:55.767
This guy here. 

00:47:55.767 --> 00:47:58.467
Remember who that is? 

00:47:58.467 --> 00:48:02.033
What did he do, if you can't
remember his name? 

00:48:02.033 --> 00:48:02.067
STUDENT: Made triphenylmethyl. 

00:48:02.067 --> 00:48:04.033
PROFESSOR: He made
triphenylmethyl, right? 

00:48:04.033 --> 00:48:05.300
That's Gomberg. 

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.600
So this is the same picture. 

00:48:06.600 --> 00:48:09.200
And there's Baeyer, who was the
boss of the lab. 

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.933
But this is Victor Villiger, a
Swiss who was working in the 

00:48:12.933 --> 00:48:14.433
Munich lab at the time. 

00:48:14.433 --> 00:48:19.300
And just at 1900, so the same
time that Gomberg was making 

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.700
triphenylmethyl, the
Baeyer-Villiger reaction was 

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:30.933
invented, which inserts oxygen
into an acyl bond. 

00:48:30.933 --> 00:48:35.133
So let me just do that one
quickly on the board, and then 

00:48:35.133 --> 00:48:36.400
we'll quit. 

00:48:44.067 --> 00:48:51.733
So what we're doing is taking R,
O, R, and we're going to insert

00:48:51.733 --> 00:48:53.800
an atom in here to make it R, O,
OR. 

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.433
So change a ketone into an
ester. 

00:49:05.433 --> 00:49:10.067
And the way it's done is to
react it with a peroxy acid. 

00:49:16.467 --> 00:49:19.867
So now we have RO minus-- 

00:49:19.867 --> 00:49:24.767
and it is acidic, so we'll take
the OO minus, 

00:49:24.767 --> 00:49:26.033
O, O. 

00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:39.000
And now, normally what we think
of is these electrons 

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:44.767
come in and lose this group. 

00:49:44.767 --> 00:49:47.500
But we don't have a leaving
group here, right? 

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.400
So instead what happens is that
these 

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:53.933
electrons come here. 

00:49:58.733 --> 00:50:04.267
So we have double bond O at the
top, R, and now what's 

00:50:04.267 --> 00:50:09.567
attached here is O, this O, and
attached to that O is the 

00:50:09.567 --> 00:50:13.833
other R, and this good 
anion has left. 

00:50:17.967 --> 00:50:23.767
So we ended up by inserting an
oxygen into the C-R bond. 

00:50:23.767 --> 00:50:27.633
And we're going to talk more
about that next time.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.730
Prof: The Gospel of
Matthew,

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.794
from the second century on,
has been pretty much the most

00:00:09.794 --> 00:00:13.803
popular famous of the Gospels,
that's probably why it's first

00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:16.567
in our Bible,
simply because it was the most

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:17.220
populous.
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.171
It's certainly the Gospel
that's most familiar to people

00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:24.260
nowadays and pretty much
throughout history,

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.780
if people were familiar with
the text at all.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.459
Both for Christians and
non-Christian often,

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:33.076
so for example,
you have the familiar birth

00:00:33.076 --> 00:00:33.700
story.
 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.768
Joseph has a dream,
he's warned,

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:39.237
the star appears in the east,
the Magi, the wise men,

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:41.640
come and they go to Herod
first.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.631
This is Herod the Great,
so they go to Herod the Great's

00:00:44.631 --> 00:00:46.590
palace in Jerusalem and they
say,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.052
where do we find this new king
that's been born because we want

00:00:49.052 --> 00:00:50.800
to go and worship him and bring
him gifts.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.595
Herod gets all worried because
he doesn't want to [lose]

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:54.460
his own throne.
 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.520
Remember this story?
 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.772
He tells the wise men,
well I think you have to go

00:00:57.772 --> 00:00:59.053
Bethlehem--
his wise men,

00:00:59.053 --> 00:01:01.210
his own wise men,
they looked it up in the

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.048
scriptures,
and they say go to Bethlehem.

00:01:03.048 --> 00:01:05.117
But he says,
come back and tell me once you

00:01:05.117 --> 00:01:07.578
visit him because I want to go
worship him too,

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:10.468
and the wicked evil king does
not want to go worship Jesus,

00:01:10.468 --> 00:01:13.045
the baby Jesus,
he wants to kill the baby

00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:13.560
Jesus.
 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.150
The wise men are warned in a
dream not to go back.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.379
You know the story, right?
 

00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:19.489
The whole thing about that,
the Egyptian sojourn,

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:23.250
the holy family goes to Egypt
to escape the wicked king.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.760
The slaughter of the innocents.
 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.605
The beatitudes:
"Blessed are the poor in

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:30.580
spirit for theirs is the kingdom
of heaven,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.190
blessed are those who mourn for
they will be comforted,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.550
blessed are the meek for they
will inherit the earth."

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.420
All these blessed,
there are some in Luke,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.848
but if you start saying them
and somebody starts picking it

00:01:42.848 --> 00:01:44.985
up after you,
and repeats it and they--it

00:01:44.985 --> 00:01:46.781
shows at least they know it
enough so they can kind of

00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:47.900
finish one every now and then.
 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.209
They almost always finish it in
the Matthew form,

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:52.590
not the Luke form.
 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.202
The beatitudes are slightly
different in Matthew and Luke,

00:01:55.202 --> 00:01:57.769
and people are--they're famous
in their Matthean form.

00:01:57.769 --> 00:02:02.048
Turn the other cheek,
that's also in Luke 6:29,

00:02:02.048 --> 00:02:06.140
but most people know it from
Matthew 5:39.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.750
In Matthew, the Pharisees are
called,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.688
over and over again,
hypocrites, and in fact if you

00:02:11.688 --> 00:02:13.805
look up the word
"Pharisee"

00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:16.266
in a dictionary,
an English dictionary,

00:02:16.266 --> 00:02:19.111
"hypocrite"
will be one of the definitions

00:02:19.111 --> 00:02:20.340
you'll find for it.
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.361
Now this is all part of a long
tradition of Christian

00:02:23.361 --> 00:02:27.024
anti-Semitism because of course
the word Pharisee doesn't

00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:29.639
mean "hypocrite"
to most Jews,

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.817
but who traced back Rabbinic
Judaism to the pre-seventy

00:02:32.817 --> 00:02:36.163
Pharisees themselves,
Gamaliel in the Book of Acts is

00:02:36.163 --> 00:02:39.197
considered a Pharisee,
and he's a famous rabbi in

00:02:39.197 --> 00:02:40.378
rabbinic materials.
 

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:43.571
Jews don't think of the word
Pharisee as being a bad

00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:46.763
term, but in a lot of English,
and a lot of languages it is

00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:48.470
because Christians used it.
 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.873
They took it straight out of
Matthew, where the Pharisees are

00:02:50.873 --> 00:02:53.318
called hypocrites over and over
again, and they just take that

00:02:53.318 --> 00:02:54.440
into their own language.
 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.092
Then you have the great
commission that ends the Gospel

00:02:58.092 --> 00:03:01.641
of Matthew,
that people might recognize,

00:03:01.641 --> 00:03:05.545
Matthew 28:18:
Jesus meets the disciples in

00:03:05.545 --> 00:03:10.860
Galilee after his resurrection,
and he says,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.348
"All authority in heaven
and on earth has been given to

00:03:13.348 --> 00:03:13.560
me.
 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.000
Go therefore and make disciples
of all nations,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.908
baptizing them in the name of
the Father,

00:03:17.908 --> 00:03:19.220
and of the Son,
and the Holy Spirit,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.870
and teaching them to obey
everything that I have commanded

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.382
you and remember I am with you
always to the end of the

00:03:24.382 --> 00:03:25.080
ages."
 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.663
That's a very famous verse
that's called "the Great

00:03:27.663 --> 00:03:29.776
Commission"
because this is Jesus telling

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.750
his disciples after his
resurrection,

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.349
go out and proclaim the Gospel
throughout the earth,

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:36.120
not just to the Jews.
 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.227
All these things make Matthew
look very familiar even to

00:03:39.227 --> 00:03:42.561
people who may not know much
about Christianity because this

00:03:42.561 --> 00:03:45.500
is stuff that you see in our
culture over again.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.781
Matthew, therefore,
is at the same time unfamiliar

00:03:48.781 --> 00:03:52.798
to people if they start reading
it carefully because it's the

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:56.681
most Jewish of the Christian
Gospels that are in the canon,

00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:57.620
that is.
 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.163
There are some other Gospels
from the ancient period that are

00:04:01.163 --> 00:04:04.590
even more Jewish than Matthew,
but they didn't make it into

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.889
the New Testament.
 

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:08.587
It's the most Jewish,
and yet it's also at the same

00:04:08.587 --> 00:04:10.552
time,
one of the most universal of

00:04:10.552 --> 00:04:13.400
the Gospels because you
precisely have an ending with

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.069
Jesus commanding the apostles to
make disciples of all nations,

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:18.629
that is all the Gentiles too.
 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.791
In the Gospel of Matthew,
Jesus limits his ministry

00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:25.839
during his lifetime pretty much
to Israel, he's going to Jews.

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:28.920
He makes a point of this in the
Gospel of Matthew.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:34.779
After his resurrection then the
message is supposed to go out.

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:38.149
Look also at the way that
Matthew begins.

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:39.970
I talked about this the very
first lecture of class.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.461
Matthew begins with,
"The book of the genesis

00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:45.528
of Jesus Christ,
son of David,

00:04:45.528 --> 00:04:47.310
son of Abraham."
 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.086
Notice he calls him son of
David, as a descendant of the

00:04:50.086 --> 00:04:52.713
great king of Israel,
son of Abraham as the father of

00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:53.370
the Jews.
 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.303
Even the Greek word there,
"the book of the

00:04:55.303 --> 00:04:57.074
genesis;"
"the genesis"

00:04:57.074 --> 00:04:58.009
means "the
beginning",

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:00.774
and of course it's the Greek
term that was given for the

00:05:00.774 --> 00:05:03.843
first book of the Hebrew Bible
when they translated the Hebrew

00:05:03.843 --> 00:05:05.805
Bible into Greek,
genesis just means

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:06.730
"the beginning."
 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.120
Of course in the Hebrew Bible
it's the beginning of the world,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.120
the beginning of earth,
the beginning of history.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.040
Matthew appropriates that term,
and he begins his own text with

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.702
that same word,
probably meaning for his

00:05:17.702 --> 00:05:20.750
readers to recall the book of
Genesis in a way.

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.509
Then you have what we call an
Haggadah on Moses.

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.870
The term Haggadah is
used in rabbinic scholarship.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.757
Rabbinic work often divides up
a lot of rabbinic materials into

00:05:42.757 --> 00:05:45.180
Halakah and
Haggadah.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.904
Halakah refers to the
teachings that are about how you

00:05:47.904 --> 00:05:48.540
should live.
 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.148
Haggadah, though,
are stories that are about the

00:05:52.148 --> 00:05:55.420
patriarchs or great figures,
and they're meant to make a

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.110
moral lesson or something like
that,

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.120
but they don't give
straightforward teachings.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.610
They tell stories and that's
how Matthew starts out.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.730
All that stuff about the evil
king wanting to kill the baby

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.850
Jesus because he's afraid that
it'll be a threat to him.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.680
Think of--who does that remind
you of?

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.470
Who does that sound like?
 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.370
The child that comes out of
Egypt, who does that sound like?

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.077
These are all meant to remind
you of Moses and so Moses--Jesus

00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:25.605
is portrayed over and over again
like Moses or like Joseph,

00:06:25.605 --> 00:06:27.490
also from the Hebrew Bible.
 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.740
Then again you have the
fulfillment-of-scripture motif.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:37.007
Now notice that in spite of the
fact though that Matthew has

00:06:37.007 --> 00:06:41.738
throughout Christianity been
interpreted as actually a

00:06:41.738 --> 00:06:44.954
rejection of the Law,
the Jewish law,

00:06:44.954 --> 00:06:47.220
or it presents Jesus as a new
Moses,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.762
but Christians they'll often
taken that to say that Jesus is

00:06:49.762 --> 00:06:52.283
not only the new Moses who can--
fulfills Moses,

00:06:52.283 --> 00:06:54.250
He displaces the old Moses.
 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.637
So Matthew's may have been put
first in the canon because it

00:06:58.637 --> 00:07:03.321
was read by Christians as being
sort of almost like the new Law,

00:07:03.321 --> 00:07:04.660
the new Torah.
 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.201
And so you have Jesus talking
about the Law,

00:07:07.201 --> 00:07:09.625
the Jewish law Torah,
and also getting new

00:07:09.625 --> 00:07:10.629
commandments.
 

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:14.920
Christians have taken that to
mean the displacement of the

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.459
Jewish Torah with now a new
Christian Torah,

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:23.250
and that actually puts Matthew
in a very odd position.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.951
Of the different Gospels in our
canon it's the most Jewish

00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:30.079
looking and sounding,
and I'll emphasize later in the

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:33.149
lecture today,
but Matthew has also been the

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:37.279
source of some of the worst
Christian anti-Semitism.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:41.850
Precisely by portraying Jesus
as rejecting the Law of Moses,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:43.560
in much of Christian
interpretation,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.759
and substituting his own law
that's Christian anti-Semitism.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.858
Notice it's from--as I said
it's from Matthew that you get

00:07:50.858 --> 00:07:53.360
the idea that Pharisees are all
hypocrites,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:56.086
and then that gets transferred
to being that all Jews are

00:07:56.086 --> 00:07:56.720
hypocrites.
 

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.375
You get the idea in
Christianity traditionally that

00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:01.980
Jesus rejected the Law because
that's legalism.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.932
The Jews are all legalistic and
we Christians are all full of

00:08:04.932 --> 00:08:05.819
grace and truth.
 

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:10.473
So this idea that the Old
Testament represents a God of

00:08:10.473 --> 00:08:12.250
anger,
and a God of strictness,

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:14.367
and a God of judgment,
and the New Testament

00:08:14.367 --> 00:08:17.620
represents a God who's a father,
and loving, and full of grace.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.639
This dualism that's so much a
part of European history,

00:08:21.639 --> 00:08:23.410
even common sense,
even people who are not

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:25.870
religious will often come up
with this caricature that the

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.290
Old Testament God is the God of
anger and judgment,

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.870
the New Testament God is a the
God of grace and forgiveness.

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:32.440
Well that's just not true.
 

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.918
If you read either testament
with any care at all.

00:08:34.918 --> 00:08:37.797
The Gospel of Matthew has been
one of the texts that's been

00:08:37.797 --> 00:08:38.740
used in this way.
 

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.207
Remember it's in the Gospel of
Matthew that you get the most

00:08:42.207 --> 00:08:45.735
anti-Jewish and anti-Semitic
line that's been used throughout

00:08:45.735 --> 00:08:49.363
Western history,
when the Jew--when Pilate wants

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:53.298
to release Jesus from being
crucified the people,

00:08:53.298 --> 00:08:56.530
the Jews say,
"His blood be upon us and

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.110
our children."
 

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:02.788
That became the Christian
charge of deicide;

00:09:02.788 --> 00:09:05.916
the Jews were then accused of
killing God, and especially in

00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:06.870
medieval Europe.
 

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.750
So Matthew is in this very
peculiar place when it comes to

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.922
the history of the
interpretation of the New

00:09:11.922 --> 00:09:12.629
Testament.
 

00:09:12.629 --> 00:09:17.080
It is at the same time the most
Jewish of our canonical Gospels,

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.946
in many ways,
and yet it's been used in

00:09:19.946 --> 00:09:24.019
Christian anti-Semitism more
than any other Gospel,

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:30.110
possibly maybe with the Gospel
of John being a rival for that.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:35.090
Look at the structure of
Matthew though.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.508
Some people have even suggested
that Matthew is intentionally

00:09:38.508 --> 00:09:41.527
structuring his Gospel to make
it look like the Torah,

00:09:41.527 --> 00:09:42.610
the Jewish law.
 

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:46.558
There are five speeches by
Jesus in Matthew.

00:09:46.558 --> 00:09:49.919
These same sayings--you learned
about the synoptic problem last

00:09:49.919 --> 00:09:50.298
week.
 

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:53.456
If you take a synoptic problem
kind of analysis of a lot this

00:09:53.456 --> 00:09:56.350
stuff that are in some of these
speeches in Matthew,

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:00.046
a lot of these sayings might
have occurred in another context

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:01.340
in Luke or in Mark.
 

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:02.928
Matthew seems to have taken
tradition--

00:10:02.928 --> 00:10:04.960
materials that were traditional
to him,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:08.990
that he found either in written
sources or in oral sources,

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.798
and he combines them into five
separate speeches.

00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:16.325
Some people say maybe he meant
to reflect the five books of

00:10:16.325 --> 00:10:19.346
Torah;
the Pentateuch is the Genesis,

00:10:19.346 --> 00:10:22.940
Exodus, Leviticus,
Numbers, and Deuteronomy.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.101
Pentateuch is just the
Greek word meaning "the

00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:29.317
five," so the first five
books of Jewish scripture are

00:10:29.317 --> 00:10:32.645
called the Pentateuch and maybe
Matthew is imitating that and

00:10:32.645 --> 00:10:36.029
making five separate speeches
for Jesus and his Gospel.

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:39.780
First, chapters 5-7 you have
Jesus giving--with the famous

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.230
Sermon on the Mount.
 

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:44.325
Then chapter 10,
you have him giving a speech to

00:10:44.325 --> 00:10:47.288
his disciples about the mission
to Israel,

00:10:47.288 --> 00:10:49.865
so all of chapter 10 is here's
how you're supposed to do your

00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:51.840
mission when you go out to
preach to Israel.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.519
You'll be persecuted;
this will happen,

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.408
do this, do that.
 

00:10:54.408 --> 00:10:57.860
Chapter 13 in Matthew is all
parables.

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:01.041
The parables that you'd find in
different places in Mark or

00:11:01.041 --> 00:11:02.846
Luke,
Matthew kind of groups them

00:11:02.846 --> 00:11:05.883
into one chapter and has Jesus
kind of give it as one sort of

00:11:05.883 --> 00:11:06.389
speech.
 

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:08.298
He likes neatness like this.
 

00:11:08.298 --> 00:11:11.303
If you look at chapter 18,
it's another speech by Jesus,

00:11:11.303 --> 00:11:14.091
again to His disciples,
and this one is mainly about

00:11:14.091 --> 00:11:15.019
church rules.
 

00:11:15.019 --> 00:11:18.052
Jesus talks about when you're
neighbor does something that you

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:20.184
don't like,
go to the neighbor first,

00:11:20.184 --> 00:11:23.211
try to settle it peaceably,
if your neighbor won't receive

00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:25.761
you or won't settle,
take it to the church and let

00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:26.940
the church handle it.
 

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.950
That sort of thing.
 

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.000
Jesus is giving instructions
about how the church should

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.720
behave itself and what the
church will be like.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.645
Then in chapters 23-25,
you get a very long speech by

00:11:38.645 --> 00:11:42.908
Jesus which includes a big
synoptic sermon.

00:11:42.908 --> 00:11:46.133
Remember last time I talked
about Mark 13 and about Jesus'

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:49.980
prophecies of all this happening
when the end of time would come,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.580
and the Messiah would swoop
down in the clouds.

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.298
Matthew takes over that speech
from Mark,

00:11:54.298 --> 00:11:56.585
where he finds it,
he adds a lot of materials on

00:11:56.585 --> 00:11:58.457
his own,
he also brings it up to date,

00:11:58.457 --> 00:12:00.490
because remember I talked about
last time,

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.298
Mark didn't explicitly tell us
about the destruction of

00:12:03.298 --> 00:12:04.649
Jerusalem in his Gospel.
 

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:06.580
You'll find that when we get to
Matthew and Luke,

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.706
they put more stuff in there
that shows they were writing

00:12:09.706 --> 00:12:12.298
after the time of Mark,
and using Mark as a source.

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:15.033
That's all in that chapter,
but then there's all these long

00:12:15.033 --> 00:12:16.730
woes to the scribes and
Pharisees.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.139
Woe to the blah, blah, blah;
woe to you who do this,

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:21.190
there's a whole section of that
speech.

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.575
So five different speeches that
some scholars have even

00:12:24.575 --> 00:12:28.149
suggested may be designed to
imitate the five books of the

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:29.090
Pentateuch.
 

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:34.538
As I said, the ending of
Matthew is universalizing.

00:12:34.538 --> 00:12:37.739
It takes this Israelite vision
that you've seen all the way

00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:40.717
through the book and then
universalizes it to the whole

00:12:40.717 --> 00:12:41.269
world.
 

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:44.928
It's a universalism to all
that's firmly anchored in

00:12:44.928 --> 00:12:46.649
Judaism and the Torah.
 

00:12:46.649 --> 00:12:50.909
What does the Torah,
the Law, mean in Matthew?

00:12:50.909 --> 00:12:54.615
Look at 5:17;
I hope you did bring your

00:12:54.615 --> 00:12:54.808
Bibles.
 

00:12:54.808 --> 00:13:00.076
Remember, we're all bringing
our Bibles to class all the time

00:13:00.076 --> 00:13:03.149
because you have to check me
out.

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:06.461
Most Christians are taught,
and most people just under the

00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:10.004
influence of Christianity have
the idea that what Christianity

00:13:10.004 --> 00:13:12.590
is,
is the supercession of Judaism.

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.092
The thing that makes Jews and
Christians alike,

00:13:15.092 --> 00:13:16.889
they both worship the same God.
 

00:13:16.889 --> 00:13:19.909
One of the things that make
them different is not only the

00:13:19.909 --> 00:13:22.770
worship by Christians of Jesus,
but also the neglect by

00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:24.519
Christians of the Jewish law.
 

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:27.779
Christians can eat shellfish,
bacon, and pork;

00:13:27.779 --> 00:13:29.038
don't have to keep the Sabbath.
 

00:13:29.038 --> 00:13:33.019
Is that the view of the Law we
find in Matthew?

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:36.852
5:17:
Do not think that I have come

00:13:36.852 --> 00:13:38.668
to abolish the law or the
prophets.

00:13:38.668 --> 00:13:41.750
I have come not to abolish but
to fulfill.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:45.313
For truly I tell you,
until heaven and earth pass

00:13:45.313 --> 00:13:48.803
away not one letter,
not one stroke of a letter,

00:13:48.803 --> 00:13:52.740
will pass from the law until
all is accomplished.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.894
Now in a lot of Christian
doctrine what you're taught is

00:13:55.894 --> 00:13:58.820
that Jesus did fulfill the law
in his own person.

00:13:58.820 --> 00:14:00.808
But that's not what he says
here.

00:14:00.808 --> 00:14:03.254
Notice, "Until heaven and
earth pass away,"

00:14:03.254 --> 00:14:06.168
that's what he's talking about
the fulfillment of it."

00:14:06.168 --> 00:14:09.190
Therefore whoever breaks one of
the least of these commandments,

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:11.581
and teaches others to do the
same, will be called least in

00:14:11.581 --> 00:14:13.991
the kingdom of heaven,
but whoever does them and

00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:15.696
teaches them,
will be called great in the

00:14:15.696 --> 00:14:16.320
kingdom of heaven.
 

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.934
For I tell you unless your
righteousness exceeds that of

00:14:18.934 --> 00:14:21.312
the scribes and Pharisees,
you will never enter the

00:14:21.312 --> 00:14:22.360
kingdom of heaven.
 

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.977
Jesus is not saying,
okay I've come,

00:14:24.977 --> 00:14:28.269
now you don't have to keep the
Jewish law.

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:29.798
He's actually teaching his own
disciples--

00:14:29.798 --> 00:14:32.686
remember if Matthew didn't want
this as a message to the members

00:14:32.686 --> 00:14:35.158
of his church he wouldn't have
put it in his Gospel.

00:14:35.158 --> 00:14:37.749
One of the things that I'm
trying to teach you in my

00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:41.000
lectures is: what does it mean
to do an exegesis of this text?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.552
Because you're going to have to
write exegesis of your own and

00:14:43.552 --> 00:14:45.977
this Friday your section leads
will walk you through how to

00:14:45.977 --> 00:14:47.149
write an exegesis paper.
 

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:50.070
There are a couple things that
are not exegesis.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.726
It's not exegesis to try to
figure out what actually

00:14:52.726 --> 00:14:53.299
happened.
 

00:14:53.299 --> 00:14:54.990
Did Jesus actually say this?
 

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.100
Did Jesus actually believe that?
 

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.851
That's part of the historical
Jesus quest which we'll talk

00:14:59.851 --> 00:15:02.940
about later in the semester too,
but exegesis doesn't do that.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.328
Exegesis doesn't assume you're
trying to read the text to get

00:15:05.328 --> 00:15:07.600
behind the text for something
that happened in history.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.080
Nor does exegesis try to figure
out is this true or not.

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.220
We don't care if it's true or
not in an exegesis class.

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:17.142
What we want to do is what did
the writer--what was the writer

00:15:17.142 --> 00:15:18.580
trying to do with this text?
 

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.928
You have to imagine yourself in
an ancient context.

00:15:20.928 --> 00:15:24.283
What would he have been saying
to members of his own Christian

00:15:24.283 --> 00:15:26.100
community in the first century?
 

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:29.618
This obviously means that we
read this text as not Jesus

00:15:29.618 --> 00:15:31.408
necessarily teaching this.
 

00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:33.360
We don't know yet whether Jesus
actually taught this.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.336
Matthew could have gotten it
from some written source,

00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:37.238
from some oral source,
or he could have just made it

00:15:37.238 --> 00:15:37.500
up.
 

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.486
We'll talk about that problem
later when we talk about the

00:15:39.486 --> 00:15:40.149
historical Jesus.
 

00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:41.690
Right now we're not going to
concern ourselves,

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:43.477
we're just going to say,
Matthew could have written this

00:15:43.477 --> 00:15:45.461
but we're trying to figure out
what did Matthew want to

00:15:45.461 --> 00:15:45.950
do with it.
 

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:47.820
What was this testament to them?
 

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.879
Obviously it means this writer
believes that the proper Gospel

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:55.538
and the proper church should be
a Law abiding church.

00:15:55.538 --> 00:15:58.765
He's expecting people in his
church not to do away with the

00:15:58.765 --> 00:15:59.490
Jewish law.
 

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:04.302
Look at "the
antitheses,"

00:16:04.302 --> 00:16:08.575
we call these,
the Matthean antithesis,

00:16:08.575 --> 00:16:12.849
5:21: "'You have heard
that it was said to those in

00:16:12.849 --> 00:16:15.879
ancient times you shall not
murder,

00:16:15.879 --> 00:16:20.259
and whoever murders shall be
liable to judgment.

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:25.668
But I tell you that the time of
the law is over and it's okay to

00:16:25.668 --> 00:16:28.931
murder.'"
That's not what it says,

00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:29.789
right?
 

00:16:29.789 --> 00:16:32.440
What does it say?
 

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.019
Just shout it out.
 

00:16:34.019 --> 00:16:37.210
What?
 

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.269
Students:
 &gt;

00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:39.908
Prof: Don't even be
angry.

00:16:39.908 --> 00:16:42.739
"'If you are angry with a
brother or a sister you will be

00:16:42.739 --> 00:16:44.724
liable to judgment,
and if you insult a brother or

00:16:44.724 --> 00:16:46.009
sister you'll be liable to the
counsel.

00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:49.293
If you say, 'You fool,' you'll
be liable to hell of

00:16:49.293 --> 00:16:53.101
fire.'" A lot of us are in
trouble, a lot of us are in

00:16:53.101 --> 00:16:53.889
trouble.
 

00:16:53.889 --> 00:16:57.143
He's not saying I'm not--I'm
getting rid of the law,

00:16:57.143 --> 00:16:58.418
murder's okay now.
 

00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:04.636
Keep going 5:27:
"'You have heard that it

00:17:04.636 --> 00:17:10.440
was said you shall not commit
adultery,

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:14.336
but I say that's okay,
adultery is just fine.'"

00:17:14.336 --> 00:17:14.720
No!
 

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:17.575
He says, "'But I say to
you that everyone who looks at a

00:17:17.575 --> 00:17:20.287
woman with lust has already
committed adultery with her in

00:17:20.287 --> 00:17:21.619
his heart.'"
Wait,

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:22.980
what?
 

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:31.038
Well I'm gay so I'm okay about
that, but a lot of guys are in a

00:17:31.038 --> 00:17:33.250
lot of trouble.
 

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.461
He's basically saying not only
is adultery not okay,

00:17:37.461 --> 00:17:42.415
even desiring her if she
belongs to another man is not

00:17:42.415 --> 00:17:43.160
okay.
 

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.799
That's not getting rid of the
law.

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:49.277
Look at 5:38:
"You have heard that it

00:17:49.277 --> 00:17:51.750
was said an eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth,

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:53.690
but I say do not resist an evil
doer.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.085
If anyone strikes you on the
right cheek turn the other also,

00:17:56.085 --> 00:17:58.480
if anyone wants to sue you take
your coat, give your cloak as

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:58.838
well.
 

00:17:58.838 --> 00:18:01.068
If anyone forces you to go one
mile go the second mile.

00:18:01.068 --> 00:18:03.298
Give to everyone who begs from
you and do not refuse anyone who

00:18:03.298 --> 00:18:04.808
wants to borrow anything from
you."

00:18:04.808 --> 00:18:08.970
These antitheses have been read
throughout Christian history by

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.796
many people as implying that
Jesus is doing away with this

00:18:12.796 --> 00:18:15.032
bad,
strict, legalism of the Jewish

00:18:15.032 --> 00:18:17.980
law,
and he's teaching you a law of

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.078
grace,
instead, and forgiveness.

00:18:20.078 --> 00:18:21.960
That's not what's going on
here, right?

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:24.811
What Jesus has said,
he's not doing away with the

00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:27.190
Law here, he's
intensifying it.

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.488
If it's hard not to commit
adultery, and believe me for a

00:18:30.488 --> 00:18:33.256
lot of people it is hard not to
commit adultery,

00:18:33.256 --> 00:18:35.200
it's even harder not to lust.
 

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.068
If it's hard not to murder
someone,

00:18:38.068 --> 00:18:40.547
and if you knew some of the
people I have to work with

00:18:40.547 --> 00:18:43.538
around here you'd know that it
is hard not to murder someone,

00:18:43.538 --> 00:18:46.460
it's even harder not to be
angry with them.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:50.637
And if it's hard not to
retaliate when someone knocks

00:18:50.637 --> 00:18:55.618
you down, it's even harder to
let them knock you down again.

00:18:55.618 --> 00:18:59.511
Jesus is intensifying the
Jewish Torah and making it

00:18:59.511 --> 00:19:01.650
almost impossible to keep.
 

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.690
But he's still expecting His
disciples to keep it.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:10.199
What Matthew presents Jesus is
doing is not getting rid,

00:19:10.199 --> 00:19:13.150
at all, of the Torah,
the Jewish law,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.200
he's intensifying it.
 

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:18.170
There are a couple of places
where it sounds like Jesus is

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:18.900
going again.
 

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:29.442
You have a hand washing
incident, let's look at that,

00:19:29.442 --> 00:19:42.015
that's in chapter 15:17--well I
think I have to start reading a

00:19:42.015 --> 00:19:45.259
bit earlier.
 

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:56.269
Where is it?
 

00:19:56.269 --> 00:19:57.769
Yeah, the very first part of
the chapter:

00:19:57.769 --> 00:20:00.189
The Pharisees and scribes came
to Jesus from Jerusalem and

00:20:00.189 --> 00:20:02.522
said, "Why do your
disciples break the tradition of

00:20:02.522 --> 00:20:03.160
the elders?
 

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.210
For they do not wash their
hands before they eat."

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.544
He answered them,
but why do you break the

00:20:06.544 --> 00:20:07.130
commandment ...?
 

00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:09.767
And He goes onto this sort of
thing and He basically says that

00:20:09.767 --> 00:20:11.843
they're not keeping the law
perfectly themselves,

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:13.400
that they should keep it
better.

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.906
Verse 10, "
He called the crowd to him and

00:20:16.906 --> 00:20:20.000
said to them,
"Listen and understand.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.557
It is not what goes into the
mouth that defiles a person,

00:20:22.557 --> 00:20:25.298
it is what comes out of the
mouth that defiles the person.

00:20:25.298 --> 00:20:28.828
Now in Mark's version of this
story, right around here,

00:20:28.828 --> 00:20:30.788
Mark adds a little sentence.
 

00:20:30.788 --> 00:20:33.188
Remember when I talked about
Mark, he gives you little clues

00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:35.098
that you're really supposed to
pay attention.

00:20:35.098 --> 00:20:38.476
Here Mark gives a little
parenthetical comment he says,

00:20:38.476 --> 00:20:41.288
"By saying this,
Jesus declared all foods

00:20:41.288 --> 00:20:42.288
clean."
 

00:20:42.288 --> 00:20:45.767
In other words,
Mark does a good little Gentile

00:20:45.767 --> 00:20:47.279
Christianity move.
 

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:50.154
He takes this saying of Jesus
and he says, Jesus was declaring

00:20:50.154 --> 00:20:52.509
all foods clean so we don't have
to keep kosher.

00:20:52.509 --> 00:20:55.529
Matthew doesn't do that,
he saw that sentence in Mark,

00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:57.590
but you read this whole
chapter, that sentence which

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.410
Matthew knew was in Mark is not
in Matthew.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.480
Matthew took that out.
 

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.400
Why?
 

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.778
Because he didn't want Jesus to
declare all foods clean;

00:21:06.778 --> 00:21:09.685
because in his Gospel Jesus
teaches that Christians have to

00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:11.038
continue keeping the Law.
 

00:21:11.038 --> 00:21:15.950
Matthew has Jesus disagree with
the scribes and Pharisees,

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.390
but what he says here is that
it's much more important--

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.845
sure, keeping kosher may be
important but it's much more

00:21:20.845 --> 00:21:23.390
important what's going on in
your heart and your mind,

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.970
it's much more important what
you say.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.818
So Jesus spiritualizes in a way
or he--

00:21:27.818 --> 00:21:30.240
again he intensifies the law
and he's saying,

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.253
yeah it's important to wash
your hands perhaps but that's

00:21:33.253 --> 00:21:34.170
not a big deal.
 

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.125
It's important to pay attention
to the kosher but that's not a

00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:37.660
big deal.
 

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.088
He makes it a moral lesson.
 

00:21:39.088 --> 00:21:41.279
That's not anti-Jewish,
that's not at all--

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:43.824
you have all kinds of Hebrew
prophets in the Old Testament

00:21:43.824 --> 00:21:46.323
doing that kind of stuff all
over the place saying things

00:21:46.323 --> 00:21:48.009
like,
God doesn't want just your

00:21:48.009 --> 00:21:49.490
sacrifice he wants your heart.
 

00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:52.519
This is the way Jesus is
presented in Matthew as--

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:56.258
just like a Jewish prophet,
an Israelite prophet who is

00:21:56.258 --> 00:21:59.261
intensifying the law,
giving it a moral teaching,

00:21:59.261 --> 00:22:01.750
but he never teaches anything
about giving it up.

00:22:09.068 --> 00:22:11.650
Jesus, though,
also besides being the one who

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:14.420
teaches about Torah,
and He's being presented as

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:17.154
Moses, and Matthew presents
Jesus more than any other

00:22:17.154 --> 00:22:19.259
Gospels as the founder of the
church.

00:22:19.259 --> 00:22:21.358
In fact, if you look for the
word "church"

00:22:21.358 --> 00:22:23.623
in some of the Gospels it's
very hard to find it because

00:22:23.623 --> 00:22:24.568
it's anachronistic.
 

00:22:24.568 --> 00:22:26.775
Jesus didn't go around in his
own life talking about the

00:22:26.775 --> 00:22:28.660
church, the church developed
after His death;

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.230
Matthew retrojects the
conversation about the church,

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:33.710
and even the foundation of the
church,

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.650
and sort of laws about the
church into the mouth of Jesus.

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:42.306
Look at 16:17,
and this is one we already read

00:22:42.306 --> 00:22:47.460
very carefully in Mark,
the same story.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.424
Remember in Mark,
Jesus says to the disciples,

00:22:49.424 --> 00:22:51.259
"Who do people say that I
am?"

00:22:51.259 --> 00:22:53.915
Peter says, "Some of them
say the Elijah,

00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:56.926
or some of them say one of the
prophets, or John the

00:22:56.926 --> 00:22:57.990
Baptist."
 

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.470
Jesus said, "But who do
you say that I am?"

00:22:59.470 --> 00:23:00.858
and Peter says,
"You're the Messiah."

00:23:00.858 --> 00:23:02.900
Jesus tells him,
"Be quiet,"

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:06.210
and then Jesus rebukes him when
Peter tells him that he's not

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:07.808
supposed to be crucified.
 

00:23:07.808 --> 00:23:11.116
Matthew takes that story again
from Mark, but notice how

00:23:11.116 --> 00:23:12.380
Matthew changes it.
 

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:16.251
Verse 13, "When Jesus came
from the district of Caesarea of

00:23:16.251 --> 00:23:17.769
Philippi,
he asked his disciples,

00:23:17.769 --> 00:23:19.059
"Who do you say that I
am?"

00:23:19.059 --> 00:23:20.500
You get the story again.
 

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.230
When Simon Peter says,
"You're the Messiah,

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.068
the Son of the Living
God," look what Jesus says

00:23:26.068 --> 00:23:28.740
in verse 17,
now in Matthew's version.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:30.969
Remember in Mark's version
Jesus said, okay don't tell

00:23:30.969 --> 00:23:31.390
anybody.
 

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.881
Jesus said to him,
"Blessed are you,

00:23:33.881 --> 00:23:35.190
Simon son of Jonah!
 

00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.583
For flesh and blood has not
revealed this to you,

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:38.880
but my Father in heaven.
 

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.510
And I tell you,
you are Peter,

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:43.662
and on this rock I will build
my church, and the gates of

00:23:43.662 --> 00:23:45.798
Hades will not prevail against
it.

00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:47.950
I will give you the keys of the
kingdom of heaven,

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.420
and whatever you bind on earth
will be bound in heaven,

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:52.134
and whatever you loose on earth
on will be loosed in

00:23:52.134 --> 00:23:52.640
heaven."
 

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.531
Then he sternly ordered the
disciples not to tell anyone

00:23:55.531 --> 00:23:56.900
that he was the Messiah.
 

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:00.724
Between the command to silence,
which came right after the

00:24:00.724 --> 00:24:03.410
confession in Mark,
Matthew puts all this

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.759
foundation-of-the church stuff.
 

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:09.219
Now this is a very famous text
that has caused all kinds of

00:24:09.219 --> 00:24:12.500
disagreement between Roman
Catholics and Protestants.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.818
Roman Catholics take this text
as teaching that Jesus,

00:24:15.818 --> 00:24:18.259
particularly selected Peter as
the first Pope,

00:24:18.259 --> 00:24:20.909
and that when he says,
I'm giving you the keys to the

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:23.157
kingdom,
it means the Pope or the Bishop

00:24:23.157 --> 00:24:26.260
of Rome is the one who has the
right to bind or loose that

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:27.950
Jesus is talking about here.
 

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:30.661
Protestants rejected that
interpretation and they said

00:24:30.661 --> 00:24:32.930
well no he's talking--
sure he's talking to Peter in

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:35.009
one sense but he was really
talking to all the apostles,

00:24:35.009 --> 00:24:37.155
and in fact,
the issue of binding and

00:24:37.155 --> 00:24:40.085
loosing is not--
is given to the apostles not

00:24:40.085 --> 00:24:41.078
just to Peter.
 

00:24:41.078 --> 00:24:44.251
So there's a debate
among--between Protestants and

00:24:44.251 --> 00:24:47.490
Roman Catholics traditionally
over this passage.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:50.596
I think the debate kind of
misses the point because I think

00:24:50.596 --> 00:24:53.650
Matthew's point is basically
just to have Jesus be the one

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:56.541
who founds the church and puts
it into the hands of his

00:24:56.541 --> 00:24:57.400
disciples.
 

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.700
That's definitely one of the
things that Jesus does.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:03.068
And then in Chapter 18,
as I've already pointed out,

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:06.229
you have a whole chapter where
Jesus gives rules to the

00:25:06.229 --> 00:25:08.920
disciples for how the church
should be run,

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.019
how it should be organized.
 

00:25:10.019 --> 00:25:14.278
The church is also this mixed
group.

00:25:14.278 --> 00:25:16.400
Over and over again,
Matthew--you'll have--

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.239
you'll see a phrase that's only
in Matthew where Jesus talks

00:25:19.239 --> 00:25:20.778
about "little ones."
 

00:25:20.778 --> 00:25:23.778
He also talks about people of
little faith.

00:25:23.778 --> 00:25:28.806
Matthew also has a parable
about a man goes out and throws

00:25:28.806 --> 00:25:30.568
a field with seed.
 

00:25:30.568 --> 00:25:34.788
And during the night his enemy
comes and sows brambles and

00:25:34.788 --> 00:25:39.306
weeds seeds in and when it all
comes up the wheat comes up but

00:25:39.306 --> 00:25:43.598
it's all mixed in with brambles
and thorns, and weeds.

00:25:43.598 --> 00:25:46.912
And so the servants--the slaves
of the man come to the master

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:48.788
and they say,
What should we do?

00:25:48.788 --> 00:25:52.498
Should we try to weed out all
the weed stuff so we can gather

00:25:52.498 --> 00:25:53.240
the wheat?
 

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.720
Should we try to trim it all
out now?

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.140
Matthew says,
no don't worry about it now

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.450
because if you try to pull up
all the thorns and the brambles,

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.348
you're bound to pull up some of
the wheat too,

00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:03.660
we'll just wait until the end,
until it's all ready,

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.988
and then we'll harvest the
whole thing and then we'll

00:26:05.988 --> 00:26:08.720
separate it out and the wheat we
will keep in storehouses,

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.838
and the brambles and thorns
will burn in hell!

00:26:10.838 --> 00:26:13.604
You're getting the last little
hellfire and brimstone sermon at

00:26:13.604 --> 00:26:14.048
the end.
 

00:26:14.048 --> 00:26:17.797
The main part of the parable is
that Matthew is saying is that

00:26:17.797 --> 00:26:21.358
the world, and possibly even the
church, is a mixed bag.

00:26:21.358 --> 00:26:23.971
In other words,
not everybody you see around

00:26:23.971 --> 00:26:26.278
you is truly who you think they
are.

00:26:26.278 --> 00:26:28.894
There's good and there's evil
mixed together but the--you're

00:26:28.894 --> 00:26:30.490
just going to have live with
that.

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:34.463
The church is an organization
that has both people of little

00:26:34.463 --> 00:26:36.890
faith and people of greater
faith.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.710
It has maybe even weeds and
wheat in it,

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.920
so these are all concerns of
what kind of--

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:46.282
there's a whole group of
parables in chapter 13 that we

00:26:46.282 --> 00:26:49.710
call the "mixed group"
parables of Matthew.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.701
They're particular to Matthew
because Matthew seems to be

00:26:52.701 --> 00:26:55.692
making the point with these
mixed group parables that the

00:26:55.692 --> 00:26:57.990
church itself is sort of a mixed
group.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:01.278
Another important theme of
Matthew--

00:27:01.278 --> 00:27:03.252
I'm giving you several
different major themes in

00:27:03.252 --> 00:27:05.269
Matthew because I'm going to ask
in a moment,

00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:07.088
why are these things here?
 

00:27:07.088 --> 00:27:09.006
What is Matthew trying to do
with these different things

00:27:09.006 --> 00:27:09.460
altogether?
 

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.904
For example,
why is Jesus the law giver and

00:27:12.904 --> 00:27:17.910
still Jewish and teaches the
acceptance of the Jewish law,

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:20.782
and yet this universalistic
message at the end of the Gospel

00:27:20.782 --> 00:27:22.048
of going to all nations.
 

00:27:22.048 --> 00:27:25.979
Another thing that exegesis is,
is finding problems in the text

00:27:25.979 --> 00:27:29.846
and then using the text itself
to try to find answers to those

00:27:29.846 --> 00:27:30.670
problems.
 

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.108
That's what exegesis does.
 

00:27:33.108 --> 00:27:35.598
Why I'm setting up some of
themes of Matthew,

00:27:35.598 --> 00:27:37.980
because these are going to be
the problems that then I,

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.150
as the wonderful scholar and
exegete that I am,

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.144
am going to swoop in with my
angels on the clouds of heaven

00:27:44.144 --> 00:27:47.038
at the end of the lecture and
give you answers to all the

00:27:47.038 --> 00:27:49.525
problems of Matthew,
and then you'll do that with

00:27:49.525 --> 00:27:50.720
your exegesis papers later.
 

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.271
One of the things that Jesus
is, also in Matthew,

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:54.068
is a teacher.
 

00:27:54.068 --> 00:27:58.519
Mark had told us in his Gospel
that Jesus was a great teacher,

00:27:58.519 --> 00:28:00.690
and people said,
Wow, he's a great teacher,

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:02.038
He teaches not like the scribes
and the Pharisees.

00:28:02.038 --> 00:28:05.250
He teaches as one with
authority.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.558
Mark didn't really tell us much
of what Jesus taught.

00:28:08.558 --> 00:28:10.898
There are a few parables,
a few controversies,

00:28:10.898 --> 00:28:13.758
but Mark tells you that Jesus
is a great teacher without

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:15.630
presenting Jesus teaching a lot.
 

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.744
Matthew not only tells you
Jesus is a good teacher,

00:28:18.744 --> 00:28:22.422
he presents a lot of teaching
of Jesus, and so you get a lot

00:28:22.422 --> 00:28:23.170
of that.
 

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:28.640
Then you get this interesting
passage in 13:51.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:36.138
Turn in your hymnals to 13:51
"Have you understood all

00:28:36.138 --> 00:28:37.818
this?"
 

00:28:37.818 --> 00:28:40.769
This is towards the end of this
big long parable chapter.

00:28:40.769 --> 00:28:42.979
Remember I told you that
chapter 13 in Matthew is where

00:28:42.979 --> 00:28:44.328
Matthew puts a ton of parables.
 

00:28:44.328 --> 00:28:47.856
So toward the end of this
parable chapter Jesus asked

00:28:47.856 --> 00:28:49.439
them,
"Have you understood all

00:28:49.439 --> 00:28:49.869
this?"
 

00:28:49.869 --> 00:28:50.990
They answered, "Yes."
 

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.673
And he said to them,
"Therefore every scribe

00:28:53.673 --> 00:28:56.861
who has been trained for the
kingdom of keaven is like the

00:28:56.861 --> 00:29:00.384
master of a household who brings
out of his treasure what is new

00:29:00.384 --> 00:29:01.950
and what is old."
 

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.108
When Jesus had finished these
parables he left that place.

00:29:05.108 --> 00:29:08.500
This is a parable that Matthew
is putting in there,

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.278
I think, to give a hint to his
readers.

00:29:11.278 --> 00:29:15.048
This is what Jesus was,
Jesus was a good scribe.

00:29:15.048 --> 00:29:18.424
That's why Jesus talks about
things like, you have heard it

00:29:18.424 --> 00:29:19.880
said, but I say to you.
 

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.251
Jesus is taking out of the
Jewish scripture and taking out

00:29:23.251 --> 00:29:26.269
of the Jewish law the most
important parts of it and

00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:29.054
emphasizing those,
and then adding some of his own

00:29:29.054 --> 00:29:29.558
teachings.
 

00:29:29.558 --> 00:29:31.910
He's taking some of the old and
some of the new,

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.910
and that's what a good scribe
is like.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.535
But Matthew also believes that
he and his fellow disciples in

00:29:37.535 --> 00:29:39.710
his church should be that way
too.

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:43.625
He writes his Gospel to help
people figure out how to imitate

00:29:43.625 --> 00:29:45.650
Jesus in being a good scribe.
 

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:52.316
How do discern what of the old
you should use and what of the

00:29:52.316 --> 00:29:54.650
new you should use.
 

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:58.107
On of the last problems that I
want to give is this really big

00:29:58.107 --> 00:30:01.170
problem in Matthew because Jesus
is also something--

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:06.009
well just right on the surface
Jesus comes across as a big like

00:30:06.009 --> 00:30:08.818
a coward in the Gospel of
Matthew.

00:30:08.818 --> 00:30:16.952
Look at 4:12 in Matthew,
in the first part of this

00:30:16.952 --> 00:30:27.078
chapter 4 you get Jesus going
around preaching the gospel,

00:30:27.078 --> 00:30:29.730
doing some miracles and that
sort of thing.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:32.298
He becomes very famous so that
people hear about Him.

00:30:32.298 --> 00:30:35.714
But then you get to 12,
"Now when Jesus heard that

00:30:35.714 --> 00:30:40.000
John had been arrested,
he got on his white charger and

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.598
He rode to the prison and he
sprang his friend John the

00:30:44.598 --> 00:30:47.240
Baptist out of prison."
 

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.234
Indiana Jesus,
no that's not what it says,

00:30:52.234 --> 00:30:53.210
right?
 

00:30:53.210 --> 00:30:55.250
"He withdrew to
Galilee,"

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:58.548
the word "withdraw"
here is the Greek word for

00:30:58.548 --> 00:30:59.990
"retreat."
 

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:04.557
He retreated to Galilee because
he had heard that John had

00:31:04.557 --> 00:31:06.000
gotten arrested.
 

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.376
"He left Nazareth,
make His home in Capernaum by

00:31:08.376 --> 00:31:10.569
the sea,
in the territory of Zebulin and

00:31:10.569 --> 00:31:12.467
Naphtali,
so that what had been spoken to

00:31:12.467 --> 00:31:14.267
the prophet Isaiah might be
fulfilled,"

00:31:14.267 --> 00:31:17.769
and then he quotes that--
verse 17 "From that time

00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:21.126
Jesus began to proclaim,
'Repent for the kingdom of

00:31:21.126 --> 00:31:23.368
keaven has come near.'"
In other words,

00:31:23.368 --> 00:31:25.960
Jesus retreats in the face of
danger,

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.451
he doesn't go toward it,
but instead of retreating and

00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:31.384
hiding,
he goes to another place and

00:31:31.384 --> 00:31:33.160
then he starts giving the
message out.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:35.724
This is when He really starts
his own preaching ministry,

00:31:35.724 --> 00:31:37.420
after John the Baptist is
arrested.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.711
Notice what happens there,
look again at--now look at

00:31:41.711 --> 00:31:43.609
12:15, Matthew 12:15.
 

00:31:47.670 --> 00:31:53.259
Reading just a little bit above
that,

00:31:53.259 --> 00:31:57.000
Jesus is disputing with the
Pharisees and verse 14 says,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.916
"But the Pharisees went
out and conspired against him

00:31:59.916 --> 00:32:02.681
how to destroy him,"
another threat this time from

00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:04.318
the Pharisees against Jesus.
 

00:32:04.318 --> 00:32:07.681
Verse 15, "When Jesus
became aware of this he

00:32:07.681 --> 00:32:10.220
departed,"
again he withdrew,

00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:13.281
there's that word again,
"Many crowds followed Him

00:32:13.281 --> 00:32:15.880
and He cured all them,
and He ordered them not to make

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:16.299
him known.
 

00:32:16.299 --> 00:32:17.308
This was to fulfill...."
 

00:32:17.308 --> 00:32:21.107
Notice again Jesus withdraws in
the face of danger but the

00:32:21.107 --> 00:32:24.707
withdrawing in a sense increases
the ministry in an odd

00:32:24.707 --> 00:32:26.038
paradoxical way.
 

00:32:26.038 --> 00:32:30.604
Then look at 14:13--well I
won't read that one,

00:32:30.604 --> 00:32:36.259
14:13 if you can look it up,
that's another case of danger

00:32:36.259 --> 00:32:38.838
and Jesus withdrawing.
 

00:32:38.838 --> 00:32:43.151
Let's do spend a little more
time looking at chapter 12

00:32:43.151 --> 00:32:45.352
because,
have you noticed that the

00:32:45.352 --> 00:32:48.260
Gospel of Matthew likes to
foreshadow things and fulfill

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:48.788
things?
 

00:32:48.788 --> 00:32:51.285
The Gospel of Matthew likes to
have Jesus do something,

00:32:51.285 --> 00:32:53.920
and then he'll tell you
something that was not in Mark.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.940
He'll say, This was to fulfill
the scripture that said--

00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.352
for example when Jesus and the
holy family run off to Egypt he

00:33:01.352 --> 00:33:04.430
then quotes to the fact when
they come back he says,

00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:06.468
"Out of Egypt I will call
my Son,"

00:33:06.468 --> 00:33:07.180
the prophecy.
 

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:09.450
Matthew takes an Old Testament
reference,

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:11.673
a Jewish scripture reference,
because remember it's not the

00:33:11.673 --> 00:33:13.545
Old Testament yet,
it's just Jewish scripture,

00:33:13.545 --> 00:33:15.796
and he takes a quotation in
that and saying it's fulfilled

00:33:15.796 --> 00:33:16.269
by Jesus.
 

00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:21.273
In the same way in Matthew
2:13-14 "After they had

00:33:21.273 --> 00:33:25.630
left," this is after the
wise men left,

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.089
"An angel of the Lord
appeared to Joseph in a dream

00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:30.022
and said get up,
take the child and His mother

00:33:30.022 --> 00:33:32.039
and flee to Egypt and remain
there until I tell you,

00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:33.348
for Herod is about."
 

00:33:33.348 --> 00:33:37.053
They flee, there's that word
again, withdraw--even Joseph

00:33:37.053 --> 00:33:40.690
with Jesus retreats in the face
of danger to Galilee.

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:46.713
Then when he hears they come
back in verse 22 of the same

00:33:46.713 --> 00:33:47.788
chapter.
 

00:33:47.788 --> 00:33:50.058
Now why is all this--Jesus
retreating?

00:33:50.058 --> 00:33:54.130
The other thing is if you look
at 10:23, we again get this same

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:54.588
word.
 

00:33:54.588 --> 00:33:57.244
When you're doing an exegesis
you might want to use a

00:33:57.244 --> 00:33:57.960
concordance.
 

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.292
You'll learn on Thursday or
Friday in your sections what a

00:34:00.292 --> 00:34:02.298
concordance is,
and you'll learn how to use it.

00:34:02.298 --> 00:34:06.604
Basically a concordance is a
book that takes all the words of

00:34:06.604 --> 00:34:09.690
the Bible and shows you where
they occur.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:11.235
If you looked up
"withdraw"

00:34:11.235 --> 00:34:13.728
in an English concordance it
would tell you every time in a

00:34:13.728 --> 00:34:16.349
certain English translation that
the word "withdraw"

00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:18.760
occurred in Matthew,
or Mark, or Luke;

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.829
you can test them out.
 

00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:22.320
You'll also learn how to use an
analytical concordance,

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:24.414
even if you don't know Greek,
which will kind of give you an

00:34:24.414 --> 00:34:25.940
idea,
once you learn how to use it,

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:28.340
what's the Greek word lying
behind these English words.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:32.007
If you did that you could find
out that these different English

00:34:32.007 --> 00:34:35.380
words that I've been reading
from translate the same Greek

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.219
word "withdraw"
anakoresis.

00:34:38.219 --> 00:34:41.853
This word is here too,
and in 10:23 you have Jesus and

00:34:41.853 --> 00:34:45.625
his instructions to the
disciples telling them that they

00:34:45.625 --> 00:34:48.780
also should retreat in the face
of danger.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.119
What is all this going on?
 

00:34:54.119 --> 00:34:55.690
How do we take these different
issues?

00:34:55.690 --> 00:34:59.251
Jesus is almost a new Moses,
Jesus is teaching the disciples

00:34:59.251 --> 00:35:03.005
should keep the Torah,
the Law, but then Jesus when he

00:35:03.005 --> 00:35:06.119
faces troubles he withdraws from
trouble,

00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:07.869
and he goes off someplace.
 

00:35:07.869 --> 00:35:10.000
But when he withdraws he ends
up preaching more.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.172
And the Gospel then is
expanding, and then the

00:35:12.172 --> 00:35:14.827
disciples, Matthew believed,
will be the next version of

00:35:14.827 --> 00:35:15.309
Jesus.
 

00:35:15.309 --> 00:35:17.230
They also will be threatened.
 

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.820
They also will be taught to
retreat.

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.407
They also will then go preach,
and they'll eventually go

00:35:22.407 --> 00:35:25.090
preach to the entire world in
the form of the Gentiles.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:32.460
All of this is Jesus functions
as a model for the disciples,

00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:34.981
the apostles,
and the apostles function as a

00:35:34.981 --> 00:35:38.150
model for Matthew and the
members of his own church.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:41.496
What is all this doing here and
why is it--what's the context in

00:35:41.496 --> 00:35:44.420
which this kind of picture of
Jesus would make sense?

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:48.387
We're going to spend a bit more
time on one important passage,

00:35:48.387 --> 00:35:49.429
Matthew 14:22.
 

00:35:56.239 --> 00:35:58.360
This is the famous story called
"The Stilling of the

00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:58.889
Storm."
 

00:35:58.889 --> 00:36:02.244
Now you will have--if you
remember this you could look at

00:36:02.244 --> 00:36:04.518
Mark 6:45 and it has the same
story.

00:36:04.518 --> 00:36:08.610
If you took your parallel
columns, one from Mark and one

00:36:08.610 --> 00:36:11.349
from Matthew,
and you did your little colored

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:14.050
pencil exercises you did last
week for your section,

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:18.293
it's very interesting to see
what does Matthew add to Mark's

00:36:18.293 --> 00:36:18.869
story?
 

00:36:18.869 --> 00:36:22.418
If you figure out what Matthew
added to Mark's story you can

00:36:22.418 --> 00:36:25.786
really get an idea about what
was Matthew's own editorial

00:36:25.786 --> 00:36:26.630
interests.
 

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:29.340
Why did he take something out
of Mark, tell it differently,

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.369
add new stuff to it?
 

00:36:30.369 --> 00:36:33.050
That gives you a great clue for
what Matthew wanted to say.

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.532
Remember each of these writers
is not just telling you stuff

00:36:35.532 --> 00:36:37.090
that happened because it
happened,

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.148
they each are writing a book
intending to put across a

00:36:40.148 --> 00:36:41.420
theological message.
 

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.039
If you compare what Matthew
says to what he gets from Mark,

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:47.059
and see what he adds and what
he takes out,

00:36:47.059 --> 00:36:50.159
you have a really good idea of
what his editorial message is,

00:36:50.159 --> 00:36:54.003
what his editorial concerns
are, and we call this Redaction

00:36:54.003 --> 00:36:54.800
Criticism.
 

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.079
Redaction is just a fancy word
for editing.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:07.050
Why did scholars not call it
"editing criticism"?

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:11.903
Because we like two-bit words
when one-bit words would work

00:37:11.903 --> 00:37:13.159
just as well.
 

00:37:13.159 --> 00:37:15.199
So it's Redaction Criticism is
what you'll see in the

00:37:15.199 --> 00:37:15.750
scholarship.
 

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:18.322
It just means paying attention
to how the Gospel writers edited

00:37:18.322 --> 00:37:20.190
their sources to get out their
own message.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:24.940
So look at 14:22,
and if you want to you can flip

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.900
over to Mark 6:45 and see the
change,

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:31.677
or if you have Throckmorton you
can look it up in Throckmorton

00:37:31.677 --> 00:37:32.179
sometime.
 

00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:34.340
I'll indicate some of it.
 

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.987
Immediately he made the
disciples get into the boat

00:37:36.987 --> 00:37:39.898
[this is after one of the
feedings of a bunch of people]

00:37:39.898 --> 00:37:43.340
and go ahead to the other side
while he dismissed the crowds.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.465
After he had dismissed the
crowds he went up to the

00:37:45.465 --> 00:37:46.739
mountain by himself to pray.
 

00:37:46.739 --> 00:37:49.807
When evening came he was there
alone, but by this time the boat

00:37:49.807 --> 00:37:52.728
battered by the waves was far
from the land for the wind was

00:37:52.728 --> 00:37:53.570
against them.
 

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.463
Notice for the wind was against
them, the boat is battered,

00:37:56.463 --> 00:37:57.809
the wind is against them.
 

00:37:57.809 --> 00:37:59.559
Some of these details won't be
in Mark,

00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:03.146
the basic story will be there,
but this thing about the boat

00:38:03.146 --> 00:38:06.163
being battered by the wind,
the wind is against them,

00:38:06.163 --> 00:38:08.550
I don't think that's in Mark if
I remember right.

00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:12.054
And early in the morning he
came walking toward them out on

00:38:12.054 --> 00:38:12.659
the sea.
 

00:38:12.659 --> 00:38:14.731
But when the disciples saw him
walking on the sea they were

00:38:14.731 --> 00:38:16.409
terrified, saying,
"It is a ghost!"

00:38:16.409 --> 00:38:17.920
And they cried out in fear.
 

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:20.708
Immediately Jesus spoke to them
and said, "Take heart,

00:38:20.708 --> 00:38:22.268
it is I;
Do not be afraid.

00:38:22.268 --> 00:38:25.179
In Mark, Jesus then gets in the
boat,

00:38:25.179 --> 00:38:28.467
stills the storm,
and Mark ends it with his own

00:38:28.467 --> 00:38:31.039
clue that they didn't
understand,

00:38:31.039 --> 00:38:33.581
they still didn't understand,
so that's part of Mark's theme

00:38:33.581 --> 00:38:34.829
about the misunderstanding.
 

00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:36.869
That's not the way Matthew ends
it here.

00:38:36.869 --> 00:38:38.630
Notice what he says:
Peter answered him,

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:40.639
"Lord, if it is you,
command me to come to you on

00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:41.360
the water."
 

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:42.369
He said, "Come."
 

00:38:42.369 --> 00:38:44.724
So Peter got out of the boat,
started walking on the water,

00:38:44.724 --> 00:38:45.699
and came toward Jesus.
 

00:38:45.699 --> 00:38:48.094
But when he noticed the strong
wind he became frightened,

00:38:48.094 --> 00:38:49.590
and beginning to sink,
he cried out,

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.829
"Lord save me!"
 

00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:52.340
"Lord save me!"
 

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.014
Now the Greek word for
"save me"

00:38:55.014 --> 00:38:57.559
can mean just "rescue
me"--

00:38:57.559 --> 00:39:00.802
save me from illness,
but it also can mean "save

00:39:00.802 --> 00:39:02.860
me" like I need salvation.
 

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:04.639
The same Greek word means both.
 

00:39:04.639 --> 00:39:07.980
Jesus immediately reached out
his hand and caught him,

00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:10.005
saying to him,
"You of little faith

00:39:10.005 --> 00:39:12.733
[that's a Matthian clue,
see Matthew likes this little

00:39:12.733 --> 00:39:15.606
faith theme so that's one of the
things you see he's added here]

00:39:15.606 --> 00:39:16.840
Why did you doubt?"
 

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:19.010
When they got into the boat,
the wind ceased.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.360
And those in the boat
worshipped him,

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.690
saying, "Truly you are the
Son of God."

00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:28.034
Now if you compare this what
you've got is some important

00:39:28.034 --> 00:39:29.230
different changes.
 

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:31.864
First, for example,
I said the boat is beaten by

00:39:31.864 --> 00:39:33.659
the waves, that's not in Mark.
 

00:39:33.659 --> 00:39:35.139
Why did Matthew add that?
 

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:38.543
Then you have this whole verses
28-31, the whole thing with

00:39:38.543 --> 00:39:41.768
Peter and all that sort of
thing, that's not in Mark.

00:39:41.768 --> 00:39:43.320
Matthew added that whole little
chunk.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.463
And then in verse 33 in says,
"They worshipped

00:39:45.463 --> 00:39:47.349
him," and they have this
confession,

00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:51.677
"Truly You are the Son of
God," which is a Christian

00:39:51.677 --> 00:39:52.599
confession.
 

00:39:52.599 --> 00:39:55.329
A famous German scholar,
Günther Bornkamm,

00:39:55.329 --> 00:39:58.416
whom you don't need remember,
and one of his students wrote a

00:39:58.416 --> 00:40:01.708
very famous article published in
the 1950s in which they analyzed

00:40:01.708 --> 00:40:02.480
this story.
 

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.907
And they said,
if you read this carefully this

00:40:04.907 --> 00:40:08.144
story's not about Jesus walking
on the water and stilling the

00:40:08.144 --> 00:40:11.530
storm and that sort of thing,
this is a story Matthew intends

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.148
for you to see the boat--
it's almost--it's like an

00:40:14.148 --> 00:40:15.849
allegory,
it's almost like an allegory.

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:18.875
The boat represents the church,
and Matthew sees the church as

00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:20.759
being persecuted,
we've seen that theme

00:40:20.759 --> 00:40:21.900
throughout Matthew.
 

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:24.619
Jesus prophesied the disciples
would be persecuted.

00:40:24.619 --> 00:40:27.467
So the boat is persecuted and
that's represented by the storm,

00:40:27.467 --> 00:40:29.476
and the winds,
and the waves buffeting them,

00:40:29.476 --> 00:40:30.550
and they're afraid.
 

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:34.043
Peter, who represents every
Christian says,

00:40:34.043 --> 00:40:38.619
I want to be like you Jesus and
I want walk on water.

00:40:38.619 --> 00:40:40.570
I want to overcome all these
problems.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:42.907
He gets out of the boat,
but he doesn't have enough

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:45.527
faith, he has a little faith,
and his doubt causes him to

00:40:45.527 --> 00:40:46.369
start sinking.
 

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:49.239
When he does that,
what should he do?

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:52.289
He should cry out to Jesus and
Jesus will save him.

00:40:52.289 --> 00:40:56.090
Then Jesus gets in the boat,
calms the storm,

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:59.460
and they worship him and
confess him.

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.650
Bornkamm used this Redaction
Criticism,

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:06.376
he was one of the first
pioneers of using this method

00:41:06.376 --> 00:41:08.369
and calling it by this term to
say,

00:41:08.369 --> 00:41:11.134
compare Matthew with what he
gets from Mark and what you do

00:41:11.134 --> 00:41:13.768
is you see that--
what was just a miracle story,

00:41:13.768 --> 00:41:16.420
just a basic story about the
power of Jesus,

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:20.460
has now become a moral story
about the church.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:24.309
And it's now become something
that Matthew is writing to

00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:26.199
encourage his own church.
 

00:41:26.199 --> 00:41:32.260
They are small,
lonely, people of little faith,

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.617
they're a mixed group,
remember, some people in the

00:41:34.617 --> 00:41:37.541
church seemed to have a lot more
faith than other people in the

00:41:37.541 --> 00:41:38.059
church.
 

00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:41.436
Some people in the church may
not even be true disciples after

00:41:41.436 --> 00:41:41.769
all.
 

00:41:41.769 --> 00:41:43.289
They're not yet perfect.
 

00:41:43.289 --> 00:41:50.889
Matthew has a saying that is
different from Luke;

00:41:50.889 --> 00:41:52.518
they seem to both get it from Q.
 

00:41:52.518 --> 00:41:55.831
Luke's version says,
"You should be merciful as

00:41:55.831 --> 00:41:58.559
Your Father in Heaven is
merciful."

00:41:58.559 --> 00:42:01.534
Does anybody happen to know
what that comes out in Matthew,

00:42:01.534 --> 00:42:03.280
it's in the Sermon on the
Mount?

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.998
"You should be perfect as
your Father in Heaven is

00:42:06.998 --> 00:42:08.099
perfect."
 

00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:11.170
Matthew has perfect and Luke
has merciful.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:15.849
Again, we see little bitty
clues of how they write this.

00:42:15.849 --> 00:42:20.550
But that's Matthew telling his
church I know you're not perfect

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:24.039
now, but God--Jesus calls you to
perfection.

00:42:24.039 --> 00:42:27.559
They need more faith and
according to Matthew's story

00:42:27.559 --> 00:42:31.688
they do it by focusing on Jesus
and worshipping him as the Son

00:42:31.688 --> 00:42:33.449
of God as they should.
 

00:42:33.449 --> 00:42:37.246
What I've done is walk through
several different passages in

00:42:37.246 --> 00:42:37.889
Matthew.
 

00:42:37.889 --> 00:42:42.940
An exegesis wouldn't ask you to
do all of those things together.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:46.266
You could write an exegesis
paper on just one section of any

00:42:46.266 --> 00:42:48.409
of those things that I talked
about.

00:42:48.409 --> 00:42:50.099
Notice what I've had to do.
 

00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:53.829
I've had to compare Matthew
with Mark and Luke,

00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:57.440
I've tried to figure out why
did Matthew include what he

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.965
included,
and why did he leave out stuff,

00:42:59.965 --> 00:43:01.980
why did he change things from
Mark?

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:06.253
I've also said he probably used
Q, this hypothetical document

00:43:06.253 --> 00:43:10.030
because we find that by
comparing Luke and Matthew.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.952
And I might guess at
how--whether Matthew has the

00:43:12.952 --> 00:43:16.059
more original version of Q or
whether Luke does,

00:43:16.059 --> 00:43:19.123
and I might try to imagine what
was in Q and how Matthew may

00:43:19.123 --> 00:43:20.889
have changed that-- edited that.
 

00:43:20.889 --> 00:43:23.414
That's all of course pure
speculation because we don't

00:43:23.414 --> 00:43:26.320
have Q as a physical document to
actually compare it with like

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.369
we've got Mark as a physical
document,

00:43:28.369 --> 00:43:29.960
but scholars still do that.
 

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.108
But the purpose is to--all the
way through to figure out what

00:43:33.108 --> 00:43:34.630
did this author want to do?
 

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:37.692
It's not concerned with whether
he's telling us the correct

00:43:37.692 --> 00:43:39.789
history;
we'll leave that for another

00:43:39.789 --> 00:43:40.070
day.
 

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:43.018
It's not to say whether it's
true or not.

00:43:43.018 --> 00:43:45.601
Notice this:
it's also not to come up with

00:43:45.601 --> 00:43:48.119
sappy Sunday school kinds of
readings.

00:43:48.119 --> 00:43:50.873
This is the hardest thing for
people to learn,

00:43:50.873 --> 00:43:53.137
and, notice,
it doesn't matter whether

00:43:53.137 --> 00:43:55.829
people have grown up in churches
or not.

00:43:55.829 --> 00:43:58.902
Modern people have just come to
think that when you read this

00:43:58.902 --> 00:44:01.922
book you're supposed to get
Sunday school type sappy answers

00:44:01.922 --> 00:44:02.639
out of it.
 

00:44:02.639 --> 00:44:04.469
What is the meaning of this
story?

00:44:04.469 --> 00:44:07.070
Well Jesus is teaching us to
love one another.

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:10.570
Well, okay yeah maybe so,
but dig deeper.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:14.344
Try to figure out--try to
imagine a historical context in

00:44:14.344 --> 00:44:18.456
which a human author is writing
the story this way in order to

00:44:18.456 --> 00:44:22.030
do something socially in his own
early community.

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.960
We imagine an early Christian
community,

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:25.960
and we imagine what problems
they had,

00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:28.688
by reading the text,
and then we see the text as

00:44:28.688 --> 00:44:31.824
being written consciously by an
author to address those

00:44:31.824 --> 00:44:32.579
problems.
 

00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:37.313
With Matthew what you get is
this: Matthew teaches that a

00:44:37.313 --> 00:44:41.369
Torah observant form of
discipleship to Jesus.

00:44:41.369 --> 00:44:46.422
Now this will be very important
because one of the themes of

00:44:46.422 --> 00:44:51.302
this whole course is that the
diversity of different early

00:44:51.302 --> 00:44:52.929
Christianities.
 

00:44:52.929 --> 00:44:55.989
It's anachronistic in the first
century to even talk about

00:44:55.989 --> 00:44:58.190
"Christianity"
as one thing,

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:00.815
because as we'll show,
there were different views of

00:45:00.815 --> 00:45:02.652
Jesus,
there were different views of

00:45:02.652 --> 00:45:03.409
the Jewish law.
 

00:45:03.409 --> 00:45:05.722
And what you'll see very
quickly in this course is

00:45:05.722 --> 00:45:08.369
Matthew has one--
has a very different view of

00:45:08.369 --> 00:45:12.309
what Christians should do with
the Jewish law than does Paul,

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:16.740
or Luke, or Mark,
or John, or several of the

00:45:16.740 --> 00:45:18.389
other writers.
 

00:45:18.389 --> 00:45:21.574
One of the things that makes
Matthew present a peculiar kind

00:45:21.574 --> 00:45:24.867
of Christianity when judged by
the standards of Paul's kind of

00:45:24.867 --> 00:45:27.835
Christianity is that Matthew
teaches Jesus as teaching a

00:45:27.835 --> 00:45:30.320
Christianity that observes
Jewish Torah.

00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.989
Even if Gentiles come in,
which the Gentiles do come in,

00:45:33.989 --> 00:45:37.260
Gentiles must be expected to
keep the law also.

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:41.719
Whereas Paul spent his whole
career trying to get Gentiles to

00:45:41.719 --> 00:45:43.284
understand,
no you don't,

00:45:43.284 --> 00:45:45.909
you're not supposed to keep the
Jewish law if you're a Gentile,

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:49.199
Jesus absolves you from keeping
the Jewish law,

00:45:49.199 --> 00:45:50.518
Matthew's not that way.
 

00:45:50.518 --> 00:45:54.378
He sees Gentiles coming into
the church but still being Torah

00:45:54.378 --> 00:45:55.150
observant.
 

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:57.811
He has a Torah observant form
of Christianity,

00:45:57.811 --> 00:46:00.119
with Jesus as the recognized
Messiah.

00:46:00.119 --> 00:46:03.918
Gentiles are included in
Israel, they're not included as

00:46:03.918 --> 00:46:07.114
a separate church,
Gentiles are brought into

00:46:07.114 --> 00:46:09.630
Israel, it looks like for
Matthew,

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:13.389
and Matthew presents a church
that is in conflict with other

00:46:13.389 --> 00:46:14.599
forms of Judaism.
 

00:46:14.599 --> 00:46:16.896
I think Matthew was written
after the year 70,

00:46:16.896 --> 00:46:19.650
certainly after the destruction
of temple in Jerusalem,

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:21.079
that seems pretty clear.
 

00:46:21.079 --> 00:46:24.110
Most of the scholars date it to
somewhere in the 80s,

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:26.809
maybe not earlier then the year
80,

00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:29.599
maybe not later than the year
90, we're guessing on this,

00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:32.309
but it seems to be--it has to
be after 70,

00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:34.239
but he's in conflict with
whoever is--

00:46:34.239 --> 00:46:36.789
there are still Pharisees
around, there are still scribes,

00:46:36.789 --> 00:46:38.958
there are other who are
offering a slightly different

00:46:38.958 --> 00:46:40.670
version of what it means to be
Jewish,

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:43.018
and that's the last thing that
I'll say about this,

00:46:43.018 --> 00:46:45.829
is that Matthew is not
presenting a new religion.

00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:51.922
He thinks what we would call
Christianity is simply the right

00:46:51.922 --> 00:46:53.750
way to be a Jew.
 

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:58.557
What Matthew is presenting is a
different sect within Judaism

00:46:58.557 --> 00:47:03.525
from the form of Judaism that's
represented by the Pharisees or

00:47:03.525 --> 00:47:05.610
the Sadducees perhaps.
 

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:08.246
A lot of people think that the
Sadducees may have become

00:47:08.246 --> 00:47:11.268
extinct after the destruction of
the temple in Jerusalem because

00:47:11.268 --> 00:47:13.936
the Sadducees were very--
they're power base was the

00:47:13.936 --> 00:47:16.635
temple, but if the Sadducees are
still around Matthew is

00:47:16.635 --> 00:47:19.630
presenting a different form of
Judaism than they followed.

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:22.608
He's presenting a different
form of Judaism represented by

00:47:22.608 --> 00:47:25.588
the Jewish writer Josephus,
or Philo, but he is presenting

00:47:25.588 --> 00:47:26.739
a form of Judaism.
 

00:47:26.739 --> 00:47:30.201
In fact, scholars nowadays say,
Matthew does not represent a

00:47:30.201 --> 00:47:35.128
new religion with his Gospel;
he actually represents a

00:47:35.128 --> 00:47:38.110
different Jewish sect.
 

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:40.969
Any questions?
 

00:47:40.969 --> 00:47:43.630
Yes sir?
 

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:45.143
Student:  Does Matthew
believe Gentiles should be

00:47:45.143 --> 00:47:45.530
circumcised?
 

00:47:45.530 --> 00:47:47.465
Prof: Does Matthew
believe that Gentiles should be

00:47:47.465 --> 00:47:47.949
circumcised?
 

00:47:47.949 --> 00:47:52.137
I think so because I can't
imagine him teaching a

00:47:52.137 --> 00:47:56.342
completely law observant--
when he says not one dot or

00:47:56.342 --> 00:47:58.175
tiddle,
or jot of the law will pass

00:47:58.175 --> 00:48:00.070
away until heaven and earth
passes away.

00:48:00.070 --> 00:48:02.807
Well, any Jew at the time
pretty much would have thought

00:48:02.807 --> 00:48:05.795
that circumcision was a very
important part of Jewish law not

00:48:05.795 --> 00:48:07.139
just a dot or a tiddle.
 

00:48:07.139 --> 00:48:08.853
So I think so,
you'll find lots of scholars

00:48:08.853 --> 00:48:10.731
who disagree with me,
but of course they're all

00:48:10.731 --> 00:48:11.139
wrong.
 

00:48:11.139 --> 00:48:13.989
Any other questions?
 

00:48:13.989 --> 00:48:16.110
Okay, see you on Wednesday.

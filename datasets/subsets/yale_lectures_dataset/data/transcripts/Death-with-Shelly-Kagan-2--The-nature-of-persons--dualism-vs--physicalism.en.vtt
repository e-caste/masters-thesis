00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.554
Professor Shelly Kagan:
The first question we want to

00:00:04.554 --> 00:00:07.528
discuss has to do with the
possibility of my surviving my

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:09.530
death.
Is there life after death?

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.220
Is there a possibility that I
might still exist or survive

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.232
after my death?
Now at first glance--and in

00:00:17.232 --> 00:00:19.859
fact, I think,
at second glance it's going to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.383
turn out to be true--you might
think that the answer to this

00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:26.190
question would depend on two
basic issues.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.860
Do I survive my death?
Do we survive our deaths?

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.709
You think, the first thing we
have to get clear on is well

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:37.480
what am I?
What kind of a thing am I?

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.560
Or generalizing,
what kind of thing is a person?

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.890
What are we made of?
What are our parts?

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.359
It seems plausible to think
that before we could answer the

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.090
question, "Do I survive?"
we need to know how I'm built.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.227
And so the first thing we're
going to spend a fair bit of

00:00:56.227 --> 00:00:59.140
time on is trying to get clear
on what's a person?

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.189
What are the fundamental
building blocks of a person?

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:06.714
The second question that you
might think we'd want to get

00:01:06.714 --> 00:01:09.987
clear on is, "What's the idea,
or what's the concept,

00:01:09.987 --> 00:01:13.450
of surviving?"
Before we ask, "Do I survive?"

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.860
we need to get clear on "What
am I?"

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.186
and "What is it to survive?"
What is it for something that

00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:24.357
exists in the future to be me?
Now this question can be

00:01:24.357 --> 00:01:27.310
discussed philosophically in
quite general terms.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.874
What's the nature of
persistence of identity over

00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:34.678
time?
But since we're especially

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:38.790
interested in beings like us,
people, this topic,

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.432
this sub-specialized version of
the question of identity,

00:01:42.432 --> 00:01:45.490
gets discussed under the rubric
of the topic,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.635
personal identity.
What's the key or the nature or

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:52.668
the basis of personal identity?
As we might put it:

00:01:52.668 --> 00:01:58.187
What is it for somebody who's
here next week to be the same

00:01:58.187 --> 00:02:01.011
person as me?
What's the nature of personal

00:02:01.011 --> 00:02:02.535
identity?
So, as I say,

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:07.335
at first glance you might think
to get clear on the answer,

00:02:07.335 --> 00:02:11.390
"Do I or might I or could I
survive my death?"

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.960
we need to know, what am I?
What's a person?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.881
What's the metaphysical
composition of people,

00:02:17.881 --> 00:02:20.576
on the one hand?
And we need to get clear on the

00:02:20.576 --> 00:02:22.349
nature of identity or
persistence or,

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.319
more specifically,
personal identity.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.583
Now as I say,
I believe that when push comes

00:02:26.583 --> 00:02:29.321
to shove, we do need to get
clear about both of those

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:32.637
questions and so that's going to
take the first several weeks of

00:02:32.637 --> 00:02:35.348
the class.
We're going to spend a couple

00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:38.120
of weeks talking about,
"What's a person?"

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.586
And then we're going to spend
several weeks,

00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:43.568
or at least a week or so,
talking about the nature of

00:02:43.568 --> 00:02:46.902
personal identity.
But before we can even get

00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:51.205
started, there's a question,
really an objection to the

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.992
whole enterprise.
So we're about to spend a lot

00:02:53.992 --> 00:02:56.500
of time asking the philosophical
question: Is there life after

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.970
death?
Could there be life after death?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.626
Might I survive my death?
But there's a philosophical

00:03:02.626 --> 00:03:04.360
objection to the entire
question.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.759
And the objection is fairly
simple.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:10.880
It says the whole question is
misconceived.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.095
It's based on a confusion.
Once we see the confusion,

00:03:16.095 --> 00:03:20.190
we can see what the answer to
our question is.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.588
Could I survive my death?
The answer has got to be--this

00:03:23.588 --> 00:03:26.445
is what the objection says--the
answer has got to be,

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:28.929
obviously not.
All right, so here's the

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:31.633
objection.
I should mention that the very

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:35.818
first reading that you're going
to be doing is a couple of pages

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:39.139
from Jay Rosenberg,
a contemporary philosopher.

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:42.280
He gives us a version of this
objection.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.180
So I'll give you one version.
You'll have another version in

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.120
your readings.
The objection basically says:

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.410
What does it mean to say that
somebody's died?

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.440
We're asking,
"Is there life after death?"

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.639
What does it mean to say that
somebody has died?

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:02.187
Well a natural definition of
death might be something like

00:04:02.187 --> 00:04:05.134
the end of life.
So then, if that's right,

00:04:05.134 --> 00:04:07.139
then to ask,
"Is there life after death?"

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:12.123
is just asking,
"Is there life after the end of

00:04:12.123 --> 00:04:14.822
life?"
The answer to that ought to be

00:04:14.822 --> 00:04:17.460
pretty obvious.
Well, obviously,

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.675
the answer to that is no.
After all, if we're saying once

00:04:22.675 --> 00:04:26.570
you've run out of life,
is there any more life?

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.047
Well, duh!
That's like asking,

00:04:29.047 --> 00:04:33.500
when I've eaten up all the food
on my plate, is there any food

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.345
left on my plate?
Or what happens in the movie

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:41.279
after the movie ends?
These are stupid questions,

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.865
because once you understand
what they're asking,

00:04:44.865 --> 00:04:48.550
the answer is just built in.
It follows trivially.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.441
So although it has seemed to
people over the ages that the

00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:53.470
question, "Is there life after
death?"

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.305
is one of the great mysteries,
one of the great philosophical

00:04:57.305 --> 00:05:00.117
things to ponder,
the objection says that's a

00:05:00.117 --> 00:05:03.196
kind of illusion.
In fact, once you think about

00:05:03.196 --> 00:05:06.610
it, and not all that long,
you can see the answer's got to

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.826
be no.
There couldn't possibly be life

00:05:08.826 --> 00:05:12.061
after death.
There couldn't possibly be life

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:15.460
after the end of life.
Or suppose we ask the question

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.399
in a slightly different way.
Might I survive my death?

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:24.509
Well what does the word
"survive" mean?

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.443
Well, survive is something like
we say that somebody's a

00:05:28.443 --> 00:05:32.520
survivor if something's happened
and they haven't died.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.590
They're still alive.
When there's a car accident,

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.110
you ask, so-and-so died,
so-and-so survived.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.059
This person survived.
To say that they survived is

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.380
just saying that they're still
alive.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.997
So, "Might I survive my death?"
is like asking,

00:05:50.997 --> 00:05:56.430
"Might I still be alive
after"--well what's death?

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.332
Death is the end of life.
So-- "might I still be alive

00:06:00.332 --> 00:06:04.914
after I've stopped living?
Might I be one of the people

00:06:04.914 --> 00:06:08.971
who didn't die when I died?"
Gosh, the answer to that is,

00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:10.290
again, duh!
No.

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:13.234
You couldn't possibly survive
your death, given the very

00:06:13.234 --> 00:06:15.991
definition.
It should remind us of--at

00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:20.509
least it reminds me of this joke
that you probably told.

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:23.810
It seemed hysterical when you
were seven.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:30.094
The plane crashes exactly on
the border of Canada and the

00:06:30.094 --> 00:06:33.730
United States.
Exactly on the border.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.413
There's dead people everywhere.
Where do they bury the

00:06:38.413 --> 00:06:40.661
survivors?
The answer is:

00:06:40.661 --> 00:06:43.678
You don't bury the survivors.
So when you're seven you think,

00:06:43.678 --> 00:06:45.170
"I don't know.
Do they bury them in Canada?

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.054
Do they bury them in America?"
The answer is:

00:06:48.054 --> 00:06:52.347
You don't bury the survivors,
because survivors are people

00:06:52.347 --> 00:06:56.649
that haven't yet died.
So, "Can I survive my death?"

00:06:56.649 --> 00:06:59.558
is like asking,
"Could I not have yet died

00:06:59.558 --> 00:07:01.355
after…?"
The answer is,

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:05.337
of course, you have to have
died if you died and you haven't

00:07:05.337 --> 00:07:09.331
survived if you've died.
So the question can't even get

00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:11.611
off the ground.
That, at least,

00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:15.424
is how the objection goes.
Now I don't mean to be utterly

00:07:15.424 --> 00:07:18.732
dismissive of the objection.
That's why I spent a couple of

00:07:18.732 --> 00:07:24.030
minutes trying to spell it out.
But I think there's a way to

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.586
respond to it.
We just have to get clearer

00:07:27.586 --> 00:07:30.940
about what precisely the
question is that we're trying to

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.372
ask.
This is something that

00:07:32.372 --> 00:07:34.259
Rosenberg tries to get clear on
as well.

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:37.561
So here's my attempt to make
the question both a bit more

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:40.509
precise, and a question that's
an open question.

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:44.180
A question we can legitimately
raise.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.091
Well, now as you will hear on
several occasions over the

00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:49.420
course of the semester,
I'm a philosopher.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.930
What that means is I don't
really know a whole lot of

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.112
facts.
So I'm about to tell you a

00:07:55.112 --> 00:07:57.450
story where I wish I knew the
facts.

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:02.135
I don't know the facts.
If I could really do it right,

00:08:02.135 --> 00:08:08.420
I'd now open the door and bring
in our guest physiologist,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.415
who would then provide the
facts that I'm--what I'm about

00:08:11.415 --> 00:08:13.019
to go is "blah,
blah, blah."

00:08:13.019 --> 00:08:17.194
But we have the physiologist
come in and he'd actually tell

00:08:17.194 --> 00:08:19.540
us these things.
I don't know them.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.667
I don't have that person.
But take a look at what happens

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:26.130
when a body dies.
Now, no doubt,

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.430
you can kill people in a lot of
different ways.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.823
You can poison them,
you can strangle them,

00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:36.379
you can shoot them in the
heart.

00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:41.235
The causal paths that result in
death may start different,

00:08:41.235 --> 00:08:45.919
but I presume that they
converge and you end up having a

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:50.259
set of events take place.
Now what are those events?

00:08:50.259 --> 00:08:53.563
This is exactly where I don't
really know the details,

00:08:53.563 --> 00:08:57.116
but I take it it's something
like: because of whatever the

00:08:57.116 --> 00:09:00.332
original input was,
eventually the blood's no

00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:04.609
longer circulating and oxygen
isn't making its way around the

00:09:04.609 --> 00:09:06.730
body.
So the brain becomes

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.956
oxygen-starved.
Because of the lack of oxygen

00:09:09.956 --> 00:09:13.518
getting to the cells,
the cells are no longer able to

00:09:13.518 --> 00:09:16.669
carry on their various metabolic
processes.

00:09:16.669 --> 00:09:19.589
Because of this,
they can't repair the various

00:09:19.589 --> 00:09:23.157
kinds of damage they need,
or create the amino acids and

00:09:23.157 --> 00:09:26.368
proteins they need.
So as decay begins to set in

00:09:26.368 --> 00:09:29.927
and the cell structures begin to
break down, they don't get

00:09:29.927 --> 00:09:32.259
repaired as they would normally
do,

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:34.976
and so eventually have
breakdown of the crucial cell

00:09:34.976 --> 00:09:37.000
structure and boom,
the body's dead.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.426
Now as I say,
I don't really know whether

00:09:39.426 --> 00:09:42.155
that's accurate,
the little rough story I just

00:09:42.155 --> 00:09:45.370
told, but some story like that
is probably right.

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:49.703
And in typical philosophical
fashion, I've drawn that story

00:09:49.703 --> 00:09:54.034
for you up here on the board.
So the events that I don't

00:09:54.034 --> 00:09:58.527
really know the details of,
we can just call B_1,

00:09:58.527 --> 00:10:00.696
B_2,
B_3,

00:10:00.696 --> 00:10:04.897
up through B_n.
Before B_1 begins,

00:10:04.897 --> 00:10:07.579
you've got the body working,
functioning,

00:10:07.579 --> 00:10:11.132
in its bodily way--respirating,
reproducing the cells,

00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:16.346
and so forth and so on.
And at the end of the process,

00:10:16.346 --> 00:10:20.240
by B_n,
the body's dead.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.248
B for bodily.
B_1 through

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:25.320
B_n;
that's what death is.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.490
At least, that's what death of
the body is.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.947
As I say, it's the sort of
thing that somebody from the

00:10:30.947 --> 00:10:34.725
medical school or a biologist or
a physiologist or something

00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:38.129
could describe for us.
So here's the question then.

00:10:38.129 --> 00:10:45.309
Suppose we call that process
"death of the body."

00:10:45.309 --> 00:10:50.904
Call what has occurred by the
end of that sequence of events,

00:10:50.904 --> 00:10:54.336
"bodily death."
Now here's a question that we

00:10:54.336 --> 00:10:57.136
can still ask,
at least it looks as though we

00:10:57.136 --> 00:11:00.855
can still ask it.
Might I, or do I,

00:11:00.855 --> 00:11:06.610
still exist after the death of
my body?

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:12.720
Might I still exist after
bodily death?

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:16.311
I don't mean to suggest in any
way that we yet know the answer

00:11:16.311 --> 00:11:19.028
to that question,
but at least that's a question

00:11:19.028 --> 00:11:21.639
that it seems as though we can
coherently raise.

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:26.126
There's no obvious
contradiction in asking:

00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:31.360
Might I still exist after the
death of my body?

00:11:34.899 --> 00:11:38.610
The answer could turn out to be
no.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:42.750
But at least it's not obviously
no.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.488
If the answer turns out to be
no, it's going to take some

00:11:46.488 --> 00:11:50.159
sustained argument to settle it
one way or the other.

00:11:50.159 --> 00:11:54.069
The answer could turn out to be
yes, for all we know at this

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:56.596
point.
This just brings us back to the

00:11:56.596 --> 00:12:00.202
thought that whether or not I
could still exist after the

00:12:00.202 --> 00:12:04.129
death of my body looks like it
should depend on what I am.

00:12:04.129 --> 00:12:07.056
So in a minute,
that's the question that I'm

00:12:07.056 --> 00:12:10.715
going to turn to.
But it's a bit cumbersome to

00:12:10.715 --> 00:12:14.940
constantly be asking:
Might I still exist after the

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:17.995
death of my body?
So no harm is done,

00:12:17.995 --> 00:12:21.802
once we've clarified the
question that we're trying to

00:12:21.802 --> 00:12:25.897
ask, if we summarize that
question in a bit of a jargon or

00:12:25.897 --> 00:12:28.410
slogan.
We say, instead of asking:

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.578
Might I survive?
Or: Might I continue to exist

00:12:30.578 --> 00:12:34.789
after the death of my body?
--you might put it this way.

00:12:34.789 --> 00:12:38.977
You might say for short:
Will I survive the death of my

00:12:38.977 --> 00:12:40.480
body?
No harm done.

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.511
Or: Will I survive my death?
Because what we were just

00:12:45.511 --> 00:12:48.741
stipulating we mean when we talk
about my death in the context of

00:12:48.741 --> 00:12:50.810
this question is the death of my
body.

00:12:50.810 --> 00:12:53.662
No harm done.
We can just say for short:

00:12:53.662 --> 00:12:58.090
Will I survive my death or
might I survive my death?

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:02.457
For that matter,
no serious harm done if we ask:

00:13:02.457 --> 00:13:06.890
Is there life after death?
As long as we understand that

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:10.299
what we're not asking about
there is life of my body.

00:13:10.299 --> 00:13:13.173
Just another familiar way of
trying to ask:

00:13:13.173 --> 00:13:15.909
Will I still be around after my
death?

00:13:15.909 --> 00:13:18.370
Will I still exist after my
death?

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.931
So I think there's a perfectly
legitimate question and that's

00:13:22.931 --> 00:13:25.820
the question we now want to turn
to.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.816
As I said, it looks as though
to answer the question,

00:13:28.816 --> 00:13:31.524
"Could I continue to exist
after the death of my

00:13:31.524 --> 00:13:33.830
body?"--"Is there life after
death?"

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:37.252
"Could I survive my death?"
for short--to answer that

00:13:37.252 --> 00:13:41.065
question, we need to get clearer
about: What exactly is it for

00:13:41.065 --> 00:13:44.317
something to be me?
That's a question we'll turn to

00:13:44.317 --> 00:13:49.161
in a couple of weeks.
First, we've got to get clearer

00:13:49.161 --> 00:13:55.250
about: What am I?
What kind of an entity am I?

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.080
What am I made of?
In philosophical jargon,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.240
this is a question from
metaphysics.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:03.843
So we're asking the
metaphysical question:

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:06.919
What kind of a thing is a
person?

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:11.226
It seems plausible to think
that whether or not a person can

00:14:11.226 --> 00:14:15.387
survive or continue to exist
after the death of his or her

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:18.379
body should depend on how he's
built,

00:14:18.379 --> 00:14:23.120
what he's made of,
what his or her parts are.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:30.375
So, let me sketch for you two
basic positions on this

00:14:30.375 --> 00:14:33.140
question.
What is a person?

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:37.319
Two basic positions.
They're both,

00:14:37.319 --> 00:14:41.880
I imagine, fairly familiar.
What we're going to have to do

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:45.247
is try to decide between them.
They're not the only possible

00:14:45.247 --> 00:14:48.490
positions on the question of the
metaphysics of the person.

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.823
But they're,
I think, the two most prominent

00:14:50.823 --> 00:14:54.080
positions and definitely the
ones most worth taking seriously

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.828
for our purposes.
So, first possible position is

00:14:58.828 --> 00:15:04.511
this.
A person is a combination of a

00:15:04.511 --> 00:15:11.500
body and something else--a mind.
But the crucial thing about

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.956
this first view that we want to
talk about is that the mind is

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:17.280
thought of as something separate
from,

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:24.685
and distinct from, the body.
To use a common enough word,

00:15:24.685 --> 00:15:27.398
it's a soul.
So people are,

00:15:27.398 --> 00:15:31.738
or people have,
or people consist of,

00:15:31.738 --> 00:15:35.913
bodies and souls.
The soul is something,

00:15:35.913 --> 00:15:38.639
as I say, distinct from the
body.

00:15:38.639 --> 00:15:41.570
I take it the idea of the body
is a familiar one.

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.711
It's this lump of flesh and
bone and muscle that's sitting

00:15:45.711 --> 00:15:49.926
here in front of you and that
each one of you sort of drags

00:15:49.926 --> 00:15:53.794
around with you.
It's the sort of thing that we

00:15:53.794 --> 00:15:58.785
can put on a scale and prod with
a stick and the biologists can

00:15:58.785 --> 00:16:01.023
study,
presumably made up of various

00:16:01.023 --> 00:16:03.110
kinds of molecules,
atoms and so forth.

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:07.861
So we've got the body.
But on this first view,

00:16:07.861 --> 00:16:11.690
we also have something that's
not body.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.659
Something that's not a material
object.

00:16:14.659 --> 00:16:18.120
Something that's not composed
of molecules and atoms.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.370
It's a soul.
It's the house of,

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.247
or the seat of,
or the basis of,

00:16:24.247 --> 00:16:28.980
consciousness and thinking,
perhaps personality.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.319
But the crucial point for this
view is that the proper

00:16:33.319 --> 00:16:38.068
metaphysical understanding of
the mind is to think of it in

00:16:38.068 --> 00:16:42.450
nonphysical terms,
nonmaterial terms.

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.269
That, as I say,
is the first basic view.

00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:47.815
I'm going to say more about
that view, a fair bit more about

00:16:47.815 --> 00:16:49.669
that view, over the next couple
of weeks.

00:16:49.669 --> 00:16:52.539
First, let me sketch the other
basic view.

00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:57.360
So this first view we can call
"the dualist view."

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:01.237
Dualist, of course,
because there's two basic

00:17:01.237 --> 00:17:04.410
components--the body and the
soul.

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.793
Although I may occasionally
slip, I'm going to try to

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:11.919
preserve the word "soul."
When I use the word "soul," I'm

00:17:11.919 --> 00:17:16.275
going to have in mind this
dualist view according to which

00:17:16.275 --> 00:17:20.019
the soul is something
immaterial, nonphysical.

00:17:20.019 --> 00:17:23.400
Some other kind--the body is a
material substance.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:27.900
The soul is an immaterial
substance.

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:31.666
That's the dualist view.
The alternative view that we're

00:17:31.666 --> 00:17:35.490
going to consider is not
dualist, but monist.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:41.639
It says there's one basic kind
of thing and only one basic kind

00:17:41.639 --> 00:17:44.840
of thing.
There are bodies.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:50.071
So what's a person?
A person is just a certain kind

00:17:50.071 --> 00:17:55.619
of material object.
A person is just a body.

00:17:55.619 --> 00:18:01.380
Of course, it's a very fancy
material object.

00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:04.809
It's a very amazing material
object.

00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:07.480
That's what this second view
says.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:13.288
The person is a body that can
do things that most other

00:18:13.288 --> 00:18:18.617
material objects can't do.
So on the monist view--which

00:18:18.617 --> 00:18:23.336
we'll call "physicalism,"
because it says that what people

00:18:23.336 --> 00:18:26.851
just are,
are these physical objects--on

00:18:26.851 --> 00:18:30.968
the physicalist view,
a person is just a body that

00:18:30.968 --> 00:18:35.252
can…now you fill in the blank.
You point out the kinds of

00:18:35.252 --> 00:18:38.540
things that we can do.
We can talk.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.490
We can think.
We can sing.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.630
We can write poetry.
We can fall in love.

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:45.440
We can be afraid.
We can make plans.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.970
We can discover things about
the universe.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:52.768
According to the physicalist
view, a person is just a body

00:18:52.768 --> 00:18:55.900
that can do all of those things:
can reflect,

00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:58.693
can be rational,
can communicate,

00:18:58.693 --> 00:19:01.486
can make plans,
can fall in love,

00:19:01.486 --> 00:19:04.910
can write poetry.
That's the physicalist view.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:08.650
As I say, we've got two basic
positions.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:13.181
There's the dualist
view--people are bodies and

00:19:13.181 --> 00:19:15.931
souls.
And there's the physicalist

00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:19.200
view, according to which there
are no souls.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:23.819
There are no immaterial objects
like that.

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:26.785
There are only bodies,
though when you've got a

00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:30.072
functioning body like ours,
so the physicalist says,

00:19:30.072 --> 00:19:33.359
these bodies can do some pretty
amazing things.

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:36.660
The kind of things that we all
know people can do.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:39.218
Two basic views.
From a logical point of view,

00:19:39.218 --> 00:19:41.829
I suppose you might have a
third possible view.

00:19:41.829 --> 00:19:46.295
If we've got the monist who
says there's bodies but there's

00:19:46.295 --> 00:19:50.452
no souls, you could imagine
somebody who says there are

00:19:50.452 --> 00:19:54.462
souls but there are no bodies.
This would roughly be a view

00:19:54.462 --> 00:19:57.345
according to which there are
minds, but there aren't really

00:19:57.345 --> 00:20:00.201
physical objects.
Physical objects are a kind of

00:20:00.201 --> 00:20:02.559
illusion, perhaps,
that we fall into.

00:20:02.559 --> 00:20:05.922
Or thinking about them in
materialistic terms might be

00:20:05.922 --> 00:20:10.323
greatly confused or mistaken.
This view is sometimes known in

00:20:10.323 --> 00:20:13.383
philosophy as idealism:
all that exists,

00:20:13.383 --> 00:20:17.756
are minds and their ideas.
Physical objects is just a way

00:20:17.756 --> 00:20:22.230
of talking about the ideas the
mind has or something like that.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.473
Idealism is a position that's
got a very long history in

00:20:25.473 --> 00:20:29.189
philosophy and for many classes
would be worth taking a fair bit

00:20:29.189 --> 00:20:31.490
of time to consider more
carefully.

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.029
But for our purposes,
I think it's not a contender.

00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:37.170
So I'm just going to put it
aside.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:39.862
The positions that I'm going
to--and there are other

00:20:39.862 --> 00:20:43.573
possibilities as well.
There are views where mind and

00:20:43.573 --> 00:20:47.971
body are just two different ways
of looking at the same

00:20:47.971 --> 00:20:52.613
underlying reality where the
underlying reality is neither

00:20:52.613 --> 00:20:56.292
physical nor mental.
That view's also worth taking

00:20:56.292 --> 00:20:59.350
seriously in a metaphysics
class, but for our purposes,

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:03.598
I mention it and put it aside.
The two views we are going to

00:21:03.598 --> 00:21:05.976
focus on are,
on the one hand,

00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:10.979
the dualist view--people have
souls as well as bodies--and the

00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:15.890
physicalist view--all we have,
all we are, are bodies.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:25.339
Let me say something more then
about the dualist position.

00:21:25.339 --> 00:21:28.875
According to the dualist,
the mind is this immaterial

00:21:28.875 --> 00:21:32.410
substance and we could call it
by different names.

00:21:32.410 --> 00:21:35.382
No harm would be done if we
call it a mind,

00:21:35.382 --> 00:21:39.205
though the reason I will
typically talk about a soul is

00:21:39.205 --> 00:21:43.240
to try to flag the crucial point
of the dualist view.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:49.064
The mind is based in,
or just is something

00:21:49.064 --> 00:21:55.884
nonphysical, something
nonmaterial…The soul can

00:21:55.884 --> 00:22:03.839
direct and give orders to the
body, on the one hand.

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:09.720
On the other hand,
the body generates input that

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:15.349
eventually gets sensed or felt
by the soul.

00:22:15.349 --> 00:22:23.817
You take a pin and you stick it
through my flesh of my body and

00:22:23.817 --> 00:22:28.870
I feel pain in my soul,
in my mind.

00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:32.991
So, two-way interaction.
As always with philosophy,

00:22:32.991 --> 00:22:36.761
there's more complicated
versions of dualism where maybe

00:22:36.761 --> 00:22:39.640
the interaction doesn't work
both ways,

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:45.278
but let's just limit ourselves
to good, old-fashioned,

00:22:45.278 --> 00:22:52.289
two-way interactionist dualism.
So my mind controls my body.

00:22:52.289 --> 00:22:56.180
My body can affect my mind in
various ways.

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:59.380
But for all that,
they're separate things.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.040
Still there's this very tight
connection.

00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:11.465
We sometimes put it:
the soul is in the body,

00:23:11.465 --> 00:23:16.310
though talking about spatial
locations here may be somewhat

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:20.087
metaphorically intended.
It's not as though we think

00:23:20.087 --> 00:23:23.228
that if you start opening up the
body you'd finally find the

00:23:23.228 --> 00:23:26.943
particular spot.
Here's the place where the soul

00:23:26.943 --> 00:23:29.176
is located.
Though it does seem,

00:23:29.176 --> 00:23:32.618
from this dualist perspective,
as though souls are located,

00:23:32.618 --> 00:23:35.170
I'm sort of viewing the world
from here.

00:23:35.170 --> 00:23:37.295
Just like each of you is
viewing the world from a

00:23:37.295 --> 00:23:40.661
particular location.
So maybe your soul is located,

00:23:40.661 --> 00:23:44.170
more or less,
in the vicinity of your body.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:47.292
Crucial point,
of course, the attraction of

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:50.490
the dualist view,
from our point of view,

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.336
is that if there's a soul as
well as the body,

00:23:54.336 --> 00:23:57.670
and the soul is something
immaterial,

00:23:57.670 --> 00:24:00.347
then when the body dies,
when we have B_1

00:24:00.347 --> 00:24:03.400
through B_n and the
death of the body occurs.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.657
So at the end of B_n,
the body stops repairing

00:24:06.657 --> 00:24:08.700
itself.
Decay sets in.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:11.675
We all know the sad story.
The worms crawl in,

00:24:11.675 --> 00:24:14.945
the worms crawl out.
At the end of the day--well it

00:24:14.945 --> 00:24:18.930
maybe it takes longer than a
day--the body has decomposed.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:24.299
Yes, all that bespeaks the end
of the body.

00:24:24.299 --> 00:24:29.460
But if the soul is something
immaterial, then that could

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:33.870
continue to exist,
even after the destruction of

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.916
the body.
That's the attraction,

00:24:36.916 --> 00:24:40.735
at least one of the
attractions, of the dualist

00:24:40.735 --> 00:24:43.750
view.
The belief in the soul gives

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:48.368
you something to continue to
exist after the end of your

00:24:48.368 --> 00:24:51.049
body.
So what's death?

00:24:51.049 --> 00:24:58.254
Well, if normally there's this
super tight connection between

00:24:58.254 --> 00:25:04.258
my soul and my body,
death might be the severing of

00:25:04.258 --> 00:25:08.820
that connection.
So the body breaks and no

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:12.710
longer is able to give input up
to the soul.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:17.775
The soul is no longer able to
control the body and make it

00:25:17.775 --> 00:25:20.559
move around.
But for all that,

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:23.640
the soul might continue to
exist.

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:28.308
And so at least the possibility
that I'll survive my death is

00:25:28.308 --> 00:25:31.888
one worth taking very,
very seriously if we are

00:25:31.888 --> 00:25:32.900
dualists.

00:25:36.559 --> 00:25:41.750
A couple of things to point out
about this view.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:47.642
One is I've been talking as
though a person is a

00:25:47.642 --> 00:25:53.660
combination, kind of a soul and
body sandwich.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.609
So a person has two basic
building blocks.

00:26:01.609 --> 00:26:04.480
The bodily part and the soul
part.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:08.607
It's natural to talk that way,
but if we want belief in the

00:26:08.607 --> 00:26:12.805
soul to help us hold out the
possibility at least that there

00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:17.079
might be life after death,
then I think we need to

00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:22.474
actually say that strictly
speaking, it's not that a person

00:26:22.474 --> 00:26:26.371
is a soul plus a body.
Strictly speaking,

00:26:26.371 --> 00:26:30.910
I think we need to say the
person just is the soul.

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:36.199
After all, if the person is the
combination, if the person is

00:26:36.199 --> 00:26:40.255
the pair, soul plus the body,
destroy the body,

00:26:40.255 --> 00:26:45.390
you've destroyed the pair.
If the person is the pair and

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:50.200
the pair no longer exists,
the person no longer exists.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:55.034
So if we want belief in a soul
to help us leave open the door

00:26:55.034 --> 00:26:59.384
to the possibility that I
survive the destruction of my

00:26:59.384 --> 00:27:02.397
body,
it had better not be that the

00:27:02.397 --> 00:27:06.551
body is an essential part of me.
It's simpler,

00:27:06.551 --> 00:27:13.115
more straightforward to say
instead, "What I am strictly

00:27:13.115 --> 00:27:17.532
speaking is a soul."
As long as the soul exists,

00:27:17.532 --> 00:27:18.090
I exist.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:26.501
Of course, my soul,
me, I, have a very tight

00:27:26.501 --> 00:27:31.597
connection to a particular body.
But still, you could,

00:27:31.597 --> 00:27:33.565
in principle,
destroy the body without

00:27:33.565 --> 00:27:36.463
destroying me.
Look, I have a particularly

00:27:36.463 --> 00:27:39.490
close connection to the house I
live in.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:43.255
But for all that,
you can destroy my house

00:27:43.255 --> 00:27:47.483
without destroying me.
So that's I think the position

00:27:47.483 --> 00:27:50.250
that we ought to ascribe to the
dualist.

00:27:50.250 --> 00:27:52.549
The person is,
strictly speaking,

00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:54.810
the soul.
The soul has a very intimate

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:57.699
connection with the body,
but the person is not the soul

00:27:57.699 --> 00:28:00.190
and the body.
The person is just the soul.

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:04.021
So even if that intimate
connection gets destroyed,

00:28:04.021 --> 00:28:07.700
the person, the soul,
could continue to exist.

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.208
The second point to clear up is
that there's really three

00:28:12.208 --> 00:28:15.589
different issues that might
interest us.

00:28:15.589 --> 00:28:21.319
One, metaphysically,
are bodies and souls distinct?

00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:28.326
Is the mind to be understood in
terms of this immaterial object,

00:28:28.326 --> 00:28:30.837
the soul?
So are there two kinds of

00:28:30.837 --> 00:28:32.490
things?
That's the first question.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:38.305
Are souls and bodies distinct?
Second question,

00:28:38.305 --> 00:28:43.959
though, is: Does the soul,
even if it exists,

00:28:43.959 --> 00:28:48.970
survive the destruction of the
body?

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:52.460
It could be something separate
without surviving.

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.330
That's why I've tried to say if
there are souls,

00:28:56.330 --> 00:29:01.188
at least that opens the door to
the possibility that we will

00:29:01.188 --> 00:29:05.281
survive our death.
But, it doesn't guarantee it,

00:29:05.281 --> 00:29:08.112
because absent further
argumentation,

00:29:08.112 --> 00:29:12.753
there's no guarantee that the
soul survives the death of the

00:29:12.753 --> 00:29:14.814
body.
Even if it's separate,

00:29:14.814 --> 00:29:17.999
it could be that it gets killed
at the very same time or

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:21.880
destroyed at the very same time
that the body's being destroyed.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:27.465
Maybe when these physical
processes, B_1 through

00:29:27.465 --> 00:29:30.210
B_n,
take place,

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:33.565
they set into motion--remember,
after all we're interactionist

00:29:33.565 --> 00:29:36.108
dualists.
There's this very tight causal

00:29:36.108 --> 00:29:39.986
connection between the body and
the mind and the soul and the

00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:44.027
body, the body and the soul.
Just like when you prick my

00:29:44.027 --> 00:29:48.553
body, that bodily process sets
up certain things taking place

00:29:48.553 --> 00:29:51.830
in my soul.
Maybe when B_1

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:56.919
through B_n take
place, they set up some other

00:29:56.919 --> 00:30:03.453
processes in my soul.
Call them S_1 through

00:30:03.453 --> 00:30:07.636
S_n.
And maybe S_1 through

00:30:07.636 --> 00:30:11.220
S_n results in the
destruction of my soul.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:19.559
So simultaneously with my body
dying, my soul dies.

00:30:19.559 --> 00:30:22.950
Okay, this one's going to be a
little bit trickier to draw.

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.850
The first part,
S_1...,

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.480
that's easy.
S_n.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.150
The question is:
How do I draw the soul?

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:30.630
I don't really know .

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:44.309
So the mere fact that we
decide, if we do ultimately

00:30:44.309 --> 00:30:48.443
decide that there is a soul,
something nonphysical,

00:30:48.443 --> 00:30:53.609
separate and distinct from the
body, doesn't guarantee that we

00:30:53.609 --> 00:30:57.766
survive our physical death.
That's going to be a separate

00:30:57.766 --> 00:31:00.855
question we'll have to turn to.
The first question's going to

00:31:00.855 --> 00:31:03.981
be: Are there any souls?
Next question is going to have

00:31:03.981 --> 00:31:07.250
to be: If there are,
do we have any good reason to

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:10.519
think that they survive the
death of the body?

00:31:10.519 --> 00:31:15.910
Third question that might
interest us, that does interest

00:31:15.910 --> 00:31:21.299
us, is this: If it survives,
how long does it survive?

00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:26.210
Does the soul continue to exist
after the death of the body?

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:30.930
Does it continue to exist
forever?

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.270
Are we immortal?

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.329
Most of us would like that to
be true.

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:43.700
We want there to be souls so
that we can be immortal.

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.559
And so the question's got to be
not only, is the soul distinct?

00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:50.690
Does it survive the death of my
body?

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:53.460
But does it continue to exist
forever?

00:31:57.390 --> 00:32:01.839
Those questions--hang on one
second--are ones that especially

00:32:01.839 --> 00:32:04.519
interest Plato.
So in about a week or so we'll

00:32:04.519 --> 00:32:06.269
start reading Plato's
Phaedo.

00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:11.013
The purpose of that dialogue,
of that philosophical work,

00:32:11.013 --> 00:32:14.910
is to argue for the immortality
of the soul.

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:16.120
That's a question we'll be
turning to.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:27.721
Yeah?
Student: [inaudible]

00:32:27.721 --> 00:32:43.050
Professor Shelly Kagan:
Great.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.696
So the question is this.
If the very idea of soul that

00:32:46.696 --> 00:32:50.145
we're working with here under
the dualist picture is the soul

00:32:50.145 --> 00:32:54.282
as an immaterial substance,
it's not made of ordinary

00:32:54.282 --> 00:32:57.942
atomic matter.
If the soul is immaterial,

00:32:57.942 --> 00:33:00.579
doesn't it follow
automatically,

00:33:00.579 --> 00:33:05.343
trivially, that the soul can't
be destroyed by a material

00:33:05.343 --> 00:33:07.701
process?
After all, there was death of

00:33:07.701 --> 00:33:09.730
the body, B_1 through
B_n.

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.599
That's a material process,
a physical process.

00:33:12.599 --> 00:33:17.704
Doesn't it follow that a soul,
an immaterial entity,

00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:23.010
can't be destroyed by a
material, physical process?

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:26.219
That's a great question.
What I want to say is,

00:33:26.219 --> 00:33:30.447
the short answer for now is,
I don't think it follows

00:33:30.447 --> 00:33:34.460
automatically.
It doesn't follow trivially.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.768
It may follow.
Plato's actually going to give

00:33:37.768 --> 00:33:41.029
us some arguments for pretty
much that same claim.

00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:45.185
Plato's going to argue once we
understand the sort of

00:33:45.185 --> 00:33:49.981
metaphysical nature of the soul,
we'll see why it couldn't be

00:33:49.981 --> 00:33:52.753
destroyed.
That's going to take some fancy

00:33:52.753 --> 00:33:55.601
arguments.
The reason I think it doesn't

00:33:55.601 --> 00:34:00.123
follow trivially is because,
remember, I said we're dealing

00:34:00.123 --> 00:34:05.058
with interactionist dualism.
We've already admitted that

00:34:05.058 --> 00:34:09.070
bodies are able to affect the
soul, right?

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:14.007
The body is having all sorts of
light bounce off my eyes of

00:34:14.007 --> 00:34:17.975
various wavelengths.
And because of that my soul is

00:34:17.975 --> 00:34:22.236
having various visual sensations
about the number of people in

00:34:22.236 --> 00:34:25.519
front of me, colors,
and so forth and so on.

00:34:25.519 --> 00:34:27.559
I gave the example of pricking
my body.

00:34:27.559 --> 00:34:33.363
That's a physical process that
causes some sorts of changes in

00:34:33.363 --> 00:34:37.550
the mental processes occurring
in my soul.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:43.081
Once we've admitted that on
this kind of dualist picture the

00:34:43.081 --> 00:34:49.269
material body can influence what
happens in the immaterial soul,

00:34:49.269 --> 00:34:52.436
then it doesn't seem that we
have any grounds for shutting

00:34:52.436 --> 00:34:55.880
the door to the possibility that
the right physical process,

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:58.321
B_1 through
B_n,

00:34:58.321 --> 00:35:01.809
might set up this horrible
mental, soul process,

00:35:01.809 --> 00:35:03.443
S_1 through
S_n,

00:35:03.443 --> 00:35:05.450
resulting in the destruction of
the soul.

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:08.270
It's a possibility.
It's going to take more

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.530
arguments to rule it out.
Yeah?

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:24.844
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:35:24.844 --> 00:35:33.788
Yeah, another great question.
The question was:

00:35:33.788 --> 00:35:37.262
I said it seems plausible to
say my soul is located,

00:35:37.262 --> 00:35:40.259
more or less,
here because I seem to view the

00:35:40.259 --> 00:35:44.650
world from here.
But maybe that's not right.

00:35:44.650 --> 00:35:49.269
Maybe we shouldn't talk about
the location of the soul at all.

00:35:49.269 --> 00:35:54.811
After all, if the soul is an
immaterial object,

00:35:54.811 --> 00:35:59.630
can immaterial objects have
locations?

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:03.320
I don't know.
The short answer is I don't

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.952
know.
I know very little about how

00:36:05.952 --> 00:36:09.059
immaterial objects are supposed
to work.

00:36:09.059 --> 00:36:14.006
So although I'm trying to
sketch the dualist position,

00:36:14.006 --> 00:36:18.766
as I explained on Tuesday,
I don't myself believe in

00:36:18.766 --> 00:36:23.071
souls.
I don't actually think that the

00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:26.952
dualist view is correct.
You might say,

00:36:26.952 --> 00:36:31.434
I'll leave that problem--are
souls spatially located or

00:36:31.434 --> 00:36:35.750
not--to be worked out by those
who believe in it.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.895
For our purposes,
I think it doesn't really

00:36:38.895 --> 00:36:41.458
matter.
If you want to say souls have a

00:36:41.458 --> 00:36:43.530
location, where are they
located?

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.550
They're located more or less
where my body is.

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:47.679
At least, as long as my body's
working.

00:36:47.679 --> 00:36:51.519
Maybe at death the soul gets
liberated from the body and is

00:36:51.519 --> 00:36:54.933
able to wander more freely.
Sometimes people talk about,

00:36:54.933 --> 00:36:58.239
in fact we'll be reading about
this, out-of-body experiences.

00:36:58.239 --> 00:37:01.432
And so maybe during those
unusual times the soul wanders

00:37:01.432 --> 00:37:03.579
from the body and comes back to
it.

00:37:03.579 --> 00:37:06.454
Or, alternatively,
maybe the soul doesn't have any

00:37:06.454 --> 00:37:09.758
location at all.
Maybe that's just an illusion

00:37:09.758 --> 00:37:14.256
created by the fact that I'm
getting this visual input from

00:37:14.256 --> 00:37:16.991
my body.
My body certainly has a

00:37:16.991 --> 00:37:19.605
location.
Maybe the right way--imagine

00:37:19.605 --> 00:37:23.582
somebody who was in a room with
remote control television setup

00:37:23.582 --> 00:37:26.872
and so forth and so on.
And he's seeing what's

00:37:26.872 --> 00:37:30.560
happening in Chicago,
even though he's sitting in a

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.884
room in New Haven.
Well, you could understand why

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:37.432
he might fall into the trap of
thinking of himself as located

00:37:37.432 --> 00:37:41.039
in Chicago with all the visual
inputs coming from Chicago.

00:37:41.039 --> 00:37:42.909
So maybe that's how it works
with the soul.

00:37:42.909 --> 00:37:46.453
We get lulled into thinking
that we are where our bodies

00:37:46.453 --> 00:37:47.939
are.
But that's really a

00:37:47.939 --> 00:37:50.889
metaphysical illusion.
I don't really know.

00:37:50.889 --> 00:37:53.900
For our purposes,
I think it's not crucial.

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.427
Though it's a great question,
but I'm not going to try to

00:37:57.427 --> 00:37:59.559
pursue it any further.
All right.

00:37:59.559 --> 00:38:01.460
So one question:
Is there a soul?

00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:04.748
Second question:
Does it survive the death of

00:38:04.748 --> 00:38:06.430
our body?
Third question:

00:38:06.430 --> 00:38:08.380
If it does, does it live
forever?

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.590
Does it continue to exist
forever?

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:13.841
Is the soul immortal?
We will initially think about

00:38:13.841 --> 00:38:17.469
the first question:
Do we have any good reason to

00:38:17.469 --> 00:38:21.655
believe in souls at all?
And only after a while will we

00:38:21.655 --> 00:38:25.803
turn to the second and third
question: Does it survive and,

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:28.449
more particularly,
is it immortal?

00:38:28.449 --> 00:38:33.039
That's the first basic view
about the nature of a person.

00:38:33.039 --> 00:38:38.013
A person has a soul,
something immaterial and not a

00:38:38.013 --> 00:38:40.396
body.
I take it that the view is a

00:38:40.396 --> 00:38:42.816
familiar one.
Many of you probably believe in

00:38:42.816 --> 00:38:44.073
it.
Those of you who don't believe

00:38:44.073 --> 00:38:45.653
in it have probably,
at least, been tempted to

00:38:45.653 --> 00:38:48.252
believe in it.
I'm sure you all do know people

00:38:48.252 --> 00:38:53.210
who believe in it.
It's a very familiar picture.

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.069
But, of course,
the question we're going to

00:38:55.069 --> 00:38:56.840
have to ask ourselves is:
Is it right?

00:38:56.840 --> 00:39:00.869
Is there reasons to believe
it's correct?

00:39:00.869 --> 00:39:06.744
Turn now to the second basic
view, the physicalist view,

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:11.550
according to which a person is
just a body.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:16.359
This is a materialist view.
People are just material

00:39:16.359 --> 00:39:21.632
objects, the sorts of things
biologists poke and prod and

00:39:21.632 --> 00:39:25.179
study.
It's important--I think this is

00:39:25.179 --> 00:39:30.489
the crucial point--that when we
say a person is just a body,

00:39:30.489 --> 00:39:35.892
we don't understand that to
mean--the physicalist doesn't

00:39:35.892 --> 00:39:40.329
mean that as--a person is just
any old body.

00:39:40.329 --> 00:39:44.186
It's not as though there aren't
important differences between

00:39:44.186 --> 00:39:48.410
different physical objects.
Some physical objects can do

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:53.132
things of a far more interesting
sort than other physical

00:39:53.132 --> 00:39:56.570
objects.
Here's a piece of chalk.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:00.000
It's a physical object.
It's just a body.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.480
What can it do?
Well, not a whole lot.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:05.410
I can write on the board with
it.

00:40:05.410 --> 00:40:10.210
I can break it in two.
You let go of it, it drops down.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:13.910
Not a very interesting physical
body.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:17.719
Here's a cell phone.
It's just a body.

00:40:17.719 --> 00:40:21.016
It's not the most interesting
physical object in the world,

00:40:21.016 --> 00:40:23.971
but it's a whole lot more
interesting than a piece of

00:40:23.971 --> 00:40:27.761
chalk.
It can do all sorts of things a

00:40:27.761 --> 00:40:33.255
piece of chalk can't do.
If the physicalist is right,

00:40:33.255 --> 00:40:38.115
then here's another physical
object for you--me,

00:40:38.115 --> 00:40:42.167
Shelly Kagan.
I'm a pretty impressive

00:40:42.167 --> 00:40:45.630
physical object.
Now arrogant as I may be,

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:49.686
I don't mean to suggest I'm any
more impressive than you guys

00:40:49.686 --> 00:40:51.761
are.
Each one of us,

00:40:51.761 --> 00:40:58.168
according to the physicalist,
is just a body that can do some

00:40:58.168 --> 00:41:04.410
amazing things.
We are bodies that can think.

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:09.690
We are bodies that can plan.
We are bodies that can reason.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:14.121
We are bodies that can feel.
We are bodies that can be

00:41:14.121 --> 00:41:18.650
afraid and be creative and have
dreams and aspirations.

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.769
We are bodies that can
communicate with each other.

00:41:21.769 --> 00:41:26.652
We are bodies that are--well,
here's a word for it:

00:41:26.652 --> 00:41:32.775
We're bodies that are people.
But on the physicalist view,

00:41:32.775 --> 00:41:37.217
a person is just a body.
And that's where we'll take it

00:41:37.217 --> 00:41:38.217
up next time.

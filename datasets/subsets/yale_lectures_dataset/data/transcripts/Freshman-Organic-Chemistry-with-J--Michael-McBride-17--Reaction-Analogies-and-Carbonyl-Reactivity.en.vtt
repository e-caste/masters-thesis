00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.841
Prof: Okay,
so this is what we looked at

00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:04.280
last time.
 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.847
We looked at an acid-base
reaction from a new point of

00:00:07.847 --> 00:00:12.088
view, from the point of view of
bringing up some HOMO to overlap

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:14.310
with this unusually low LUMO.
 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:20.004
Why is it unusually low,
the LUMO, σ*,

00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:21.030
of H-F?
 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.400
Why is it unusually low?
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.890
Is the overlap bad?
 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.530
&lt;&lt;Students speak over one
another&gt;&gt;

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.084
Prof: Does the hybrid
orbital on fluorine and the

00:00:31.084 --> 00:00:33.940
s orbital on hydrogen,
does that have bad overlap,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.210
or does it overlap well?
 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.170
Points right at it,
good overlap.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.950
So that's not the reason it's
unusual.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.265
What's the reason that the
energy of this vacant orbital is

00:00:43.265 --> 00:00:44.010
unusual?
 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.360
Dana?
 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.810
Student:  The unusual
atomic energy of fluorine?

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.103
Prof: Right,
because fluorine started very

00:00:50.103 --> 00:00:51.232
low;
so that went down,

00:00:51.232 --> 00:00:52.590
when it mixed with hydrogen.
 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.043
Hydrogen went up,
but it didn't go up very far,

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:56.910
because the energy match was
bad.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.078
So that's this LUMO,
the unfavorable combination of

00:01:01.078 --> 00:01:03.079
fluorine and hydrogen.
 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.644
Which is it big on,
hydrogen or fluorine,

00:01:05.644 --> 00:01:07.120
the one that went up?
 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.290
Hydrogen, right?
 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.590
The good one is mostly on
fluorine;

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.034
the bad one,
σ*,

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:14.120
mostly on hydrogen.
 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.239
And it has that node shown as
an antibonding node;

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:19.909
σ*,
the star means antibonding.

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.223
So in OH^-, with its high
energy occupied orbital -- now

00:01:23.223 --> 00:01:25.634
wait a second,
why is an unshared pair on

00:01:25.634 --> 00:01:27.019
oxygen high energy?
 

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:30.192
I thought oxygen had a big
nuclear charge,

00:01:30.192 --> 00:01:34.760
which would make electrons
stable, not have them be high.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.050
Why is OH^- high?
 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.680
Obinna, do you have an idea
about that?

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.943
What is it about OH^-,
the unshared pair that makes

00:01:47.943 --> 00:01:51.440
the electrons unusually high in
energy?

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.430
Student:  Because it
didn't mix.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.940
Prof: Can't hear.
 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.069
Student:  It didn't mix.
 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.510
Prof: Because it didn't
mix with anything else.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.879
Right?
 

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:58.080
It's not like a bond that went
down.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.578
We're comparing it to C-H or
C-C σ bonds that

00:02:01.578 --> 00:02:02.930
went down in energy.
 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.986
So even though oxygen started
low, it didn't go down.

00:02:06.986 --> 00:02:07.609
Right?
 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.788
So it's left unusually high.
 

00:02:09.788 --> 00:02:13.276
And there's actually another
reason that this one is

00:02:13.276 --> 00:02:14.439
unusually high.
 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:15.098
Josh?
 

00:02:15.098 --> 00:02:15.889
Student:  Negative
charge on --

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.889
Prof: Negative charge on
oxygen doesn't make electrons

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:19.288
happy.
 

00:02:19.288 --> 00:02:21.788
Okay, so it comes along,
mixes with that.

00:02:21.788 --> 00:02:24.431
In the process of putting
electrons into that orbital,

00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:25.430
it makes the bond.
 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.169
But also it makes it
antibonding between hydrogen and

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:29.960
fluorine.
 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.750
So we draw that second curved
arrow that shows the fluorine

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.538
leaving with the electrons,
that it already had most of.

00:02:37.538 --> 00:02:40.288
The electrons it leaves with --
not that you can really label

00:02:40.288 --> 00:02:42.810
electrons and say this one is
this, this one is this.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.300
But remember,
fluorine mixed with hydrogen

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.030
went down.
 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.794
It already has most of those
electrons that came from

00:02:48.794 --> 00:02:49.378
hydrogen.
 

00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:52.180
Now it has them all when it
breaks away.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.669
It breaks away as an ion, F^-.
 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.818
Okay, and that's an acid-base
reaction;

00:02:56.818 --> 00:03:01.150
a more general interpretation
of acid-base,

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.758
than just H^+ reacting with
OH^-.

00:03:04.758 --> 00:03:08.110
Okay, now let's generalize a
little bit further.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.444
So notice that besides creating
a new bond, which would happen

00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:18.604
with H^+, mixing the HOMO with
this LUMO can break a bond --

00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:19.479
right?
 

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.645
-- if the LUMO,
shown there,

00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:23.729
has an antibonding node.
 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:27.661
Putting in electrons means that
those electrons will be more

00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:29.659
stable if fluorine moves away.
 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:30.258
Right?
 

00:03:30.258 --> 00:03:34.300
So you not only make a bond,
you also break a bond.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.680
So it's a make-and-break
situation;

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.560
whereas H^+ plus OH^- is just a
make situation.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.503
Okay, now let's look at F-CH_3.
 

00:03:46.503 --> 00:03:47.169
Right?
 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:51.960
And look at the orbital,
and I'm going to superimpose on

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.270
it the corresponding LUMO of
F-CH_3.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:01.120
Watch it change.
 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.733
The carbon-fluorine bond is
longer than the carbon-hydrogen

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:06.289
bond.
 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:07.628
So it moved away.
 

00:04:07.628 --> 00:04:10.168
But the shape,
especially around the fluorine,

00:04:10.168 --> 00:04:11.408
is almost identical.
 

00:04:11.408 --> 00:04:15.500
I'll back up and do the change
again.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:16.410
Right?
 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.050
So it's going to have very
similar properties to what H-F

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.439
did.
 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.057
So if I move it over,
you see it's going to be

00:04:23.057 --> 00:04:26.141
attacked by something coming
here to overlap with that

00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:26.839
orbital.
 

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:29.509
Some high HOMO will mix with
the low LUMO.

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:31.569
And here we show OH^- doing it.
 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.079
And then what will happen?
 

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:37.949
Remember, we have this
antibonding node here.

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:39.910
What happens when electrons go
into that orbital?

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.680
Kate?
 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.540
Student:  It breaks the
bond.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.339
Prof: Kate?
 

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:44.120
Student:  It breaks.
 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.788
The fluorine is going --
Prof: Yes,

00:04:45.788 --> 00:04:48.569
the fluorine will take
electrons and move away,

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:49.175
like that.
 

00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:49.779
Right?
 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:53.182
So we get fluoride and
methanol.

00:04:53.182 --> 00:04:54.060
Right?
 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.550
And this reaction,
which we'll study at the

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.516
beginning of next semester --
and we'll mention a little bit

00:04:59.516 --> 00:05:00.870
more as we go along this
semester,

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.660
but systematically we'll talk
about it next semester --

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.040
is called SN2 Substitution.
 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.853
But notice, it's,
from the point of view of

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:13.538
orbitals, exactly the same
make-and-break situation that

00:05:13.538 --> 00:05:16.220
you had with OH^- reacting with
H-F.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.228
It's the same reaction,
just the names have been

00:05:20.228 --> 00:05:20.911
changed.
 

00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:21.680
Right?
 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.488
So you could,
in fact, have called the

00:05:24.488 --> 00:05:28.437
reaction of OH^- with H-F,
you could've called that a

00:05:28.437 --> 00:05:29.730
substitution.
 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.259
It could've been SN2
Substitution.

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.759
The difference would be that
the atom on which the

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.831
substitution takes place,
the one that gets attacked and

00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:42.649
then loses the F^-,
is hydrogen rather than carbon.

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:45.901
So you could call both
reactions substitution,

00:05:45.901 --> 00:05:49.297
or you could call them both
acid-base reactions.

00:05:49.297 --> 00:05:50.019
Right?
 

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:53.093
So that's the way sciences,
as I said last time,

00:05:53.093 --> 00:05:57.146
progress, by seeing generality,
where things were thought to be

00:05:57.146 --> 00:05:58.519
different before.
 

00:05:58.519 --> 00:06:02.985
Okay, so we have these two
reactions, acid-base reaction,

00:06:02.985 --> 00:06:04.500
SN2 Substitution.
 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.535
What would happen if we had
ethyl fluoride,

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:14.300
sometimes known as ethanol --
improperly labeled -- right?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.040
-- earlier today.
 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.120
Okay, so that's the LUMO of
ethanol .

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.300
Now that doesn't look exactly
like the LUMO we just calculated

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.259
of ethanol .
 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:27.769
But remember it was the LUMO+3.
 

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:29.089
Wasn't it that we found?
 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:32.180
It was either plus two or plus
-- it was plus three wasn't it?

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.040
The LUMO+3, remember,
had this characteristic,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.529
that it's a favorable mixture
of two simple pairwise orbitals.

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:44.810
That one is what?
 

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.470
What's that orbital,
if you just saw that?

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:54.009
Student: 
&gt;

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:54.550
Prof: Josh?
 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.410
Student:  It's the same
thing as the other one.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:56.916
Prof: Ah-ha,
it's the same thing as up

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:57.120
there.
 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.430
Right?
 

00:06:57.430 --> 00:07:04.079
It's σ* C-H,
instead of C-F.

00:07:04.079 --> 00:07:07.579
Well it's certainly
σ*,

00:07:07.579 --> 00:07:10.278
but it's of H-C,
not of F-C.

00:07:10.278 --> 00:07:11.279
Right?
 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:12.310
Everybody got that?
 

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.949
So but it's σ*,
that's the important thing.

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:19.625
It's the antibonding
combination, σ*

00:07:19.625 --> 00:07:20.209
C-H.
 

00:07:20.209 --> 00:07:24.901
Okay, and what's the other
thing that goes into this LUMO,

00:07:24.901 --> 00:07:26.959
or actually the LUMO+3?
 

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:27.759
It's this.
 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.360
What's that? Right?
 

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.240
Angela?
 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:36.949
Student:  It's the
&gt;

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:37.810
Prof: Can you give it a
name?

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:44.185
Student:  It's the
σ* of

00:07:44.185 --> 00:07:48.190
&gt;
 

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:51.190
Prof: If you name just
two atoms, what is it?

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:53.970
Speak up loudly so everybody
can hear.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.930
Student:  σ*
C-F.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.149
Prof: σ*
C-F.

00:07:56.149 --> 00:08:00.689
Everybody see that?
 

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.920
Okay, and I say it's the
favorable mixture of these two,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.502
because they're put together so
as to be bonding between them.

00:08:07.502 --> 00:08:08.088
Right?
 

00:08:08.088 --> 00:08:11.934
So there were two vacant
orbitals, σ* C-F

00:08:11.934 --> 00:08:15.242
and σ*C-H,
and they mixed,

00:08:15.242 --> 00:08:19.975
and the favorable combination,
where they overlapped favorably

00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:22.170
between those two,
is the one we're looking at.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.757
It's still vacant,
it's an unoccupied molecular

00:08:24.757 --> 00:08:25.319
orbital.
 

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:28.540
But that's the one we're
looking at here.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.490
Okay, now how should it react?
 

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.422
Well that one looks like the
top right, except that the

00:08:36.422 --> 00:08:38.157
colors are changed.
 

00:08:38.157 --> 00:08:38.980
Right?
 

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.330
So how about doing SN2
substitution?

00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:45.730
Now Russell cringed when I did
that.

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.610
What's wrong with doing SN2
substitution?

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.200
Student:  We have to get
a favorable overlap with --

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.740
Prof: Ah-ha!
 

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.658
what's hidden here is that bit.
 

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:56.822
It's going to be hard to
overlap with the blue on top,

00:08:56.822 --> 00:09:00.163
without having an unfavorable
overlap with the red on the

00:09:00.163 --> 00:09:00.820
bottom.
 

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.899
So there's another way you
could do it.

00:09:02.899 --> 00:09:05.139
You could attack here -- right?
 

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:09.441
-- and get a big orbital,
a big lobe, all of the same

00:09:09.441 --> 00:09:10.019
sign.
 

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:11.980
So there you're going to get
good overlap.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.200
So might it do that?
 

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.320
So there are two possibilities.
 

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.025
It could do the same as the
top, it could do SN2

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:20.501
substitution,
or it could put electrons into

00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:23.899
this LUMO by attacking from this
second arrow position.

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:26.279
And how do you know which one
it does?

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:28.240
Students:  Experiments.
 

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.559
Prof: You do experiment.
 

00:09:29.559 --> 00:09:31.808
So this is lore, right?
 

00:09:31.808 --> 00:09:35.514
And when we get to studying
these reactions systematically,

00:09:35.514 --> 00:09:38.580
you'll see that both
things can happen.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.827
They're both possibilities,
and you can make little tweaks

00:09:41.827 --> 00:09:44.279
in solvent or base and things
like that,

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:46.746
what HOMO you're using,
that'll make it go a little

00:09:46.746 --> 00:09:48.820
more one way or a little more
the other.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.139
But that, of course,
takes time to do all the

00:09:51.139 --> 00:09:53.090
experiments and to hear about
them.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.860
But anyhow, there are these two
possibilities.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:58.340
Now let's suppose it does the
second one.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.320
Now how did I set it up so that
that would be favorable?

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:04.249
I didn't use the true LUMO of
the lowest energy,

00:10:04.249 --> 00:10:07.178
of the molecule,
which I just calculated for you

00:10:07.178 --> 00:10:09.048
at the beginning of class.
 

00:10:09.048 --> 00:10:15.058
What I did was use that LUMO+3,
but made it the LUMO.

00:10:15.058 --> 00:10:18.808
And the way I made it the LUMO
was to stretch bonds.

00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:24.856
I stretched the C-H bond and I
stretched the C-F bond.

00:10:24.856 --> 00:10:25.769
Right?
 

00:10:25.769 --> 00:10:30.527
And then if I -- in this
particular phase of vibration of

00:10:30.527 --> 00:10:34.178
the atoms, this one is in fact,
the LUMO.

00:10:34.178 --> 00:10:36.100
Okay, now why did I want to
show you this?

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.080
Look what happens if you do
that bottom thing.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.720
Okay, so we bring OH^- up,
and the electrons go into this

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.928
and make a bond between H and O.
 

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:49.649
But there's a node here,
that antibonding node.

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:55.158
What does that mean,
if you put electrons into this

00:10:55.158 --> 00:10:56.259
orbital?
 

00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:58.419
Lexy, what do you say?
 

00:10:58.419 --> 00:10:58.960
Student:  It'll break.
 

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.460
Prof: It'll break where?
 

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.769
Student: 
&gt;

00:11:01.769 --> 00:11:04.278
Prof: Between the
hydrogen and the carbon.

00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:07.543
Okay, so we're going to --
we'll draw a second curved arrow

00:11:07.543 --> 00:11:09.850
that shows those electrons
pulling out.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:10.659
Okay?
 

00:11:10.659 --> 00:11:12.788
Now where do they go?
 

00:11:12.788 --> 00:11:16.570
Look here, there's an atomic
orbital node there.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.048
That's not an antibonding node
because it's the node of the

00:11:20.048 --> 00:11:22.149
p orbitals on the
carbons.

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:24.399
Everybody see that that's not
antibonding?

00:11:24.399 --> 00:11:28.089
Because it doesn't go between
the atoms, it goes through the

00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:28.590
atoms.
 

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:31.027
So, in fact,
if you look at that blue and

00:11:31.027 --> 00:11:34.500
red lobe in the middle,
they're a little bit distorted.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.190
But what do they look like?
 

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.549
If you look just at the red and
blue in the middle?

00:11:39.549 --> 00:11:40.350
Lucas?
 

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.259
Student:  p
orbitals.

00:11:41.259 --> 00:11:43.860
Prof: Not p.
 

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.220
Greek.
 

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.058
Student:  Oh π.
 

00:11:46.058 --> 00:11:47.565
Prof: It's the
π orbital,

00:11:47.565 --> 00:11:49.669
made up of 2p orbitals;
the p orbital of the

00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:51.221
carbon on the top,
the p orbital of the

00:11:51.221 --> 00:11:52.048
carbon on the bottom.
 

00:11:52.048 --> 00:11:55.375
And you put electrons in that
and you get a double bond

00:11:55.375 --> 00:11:56.730
between the carbons.
 

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.570
Okay?
 

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:02.610
Okay, so there's a π
bonding between the carbons.

00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:06.505
That means we can draw a second
arrow that takes the electrons

00:12:06.505 --> 00:12:10.337
out of the bond that's breaking
and puts them between the two

00:12:10.337 --> 00:12:12.509
carbons to make a double bond.
 

00:12:12.509 --> 00:12:13.730
Okay?
 

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:17.440
But now there's another node in
this LUMO;

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.490
there, that antibonding node.
 

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:24.269
What happens with respect to
that, when we put electrons in

00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:25.259
this LUMO?
 

00:12:25.259 --> 00:12:27.870
Rick, what do you say?
 

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:32.176
Student:  The C is going
to break the bond between the C

00:12:32.176 --> 00:12:33.009
and the F.
 

00:12:33.009 --> 00:12:34.918
Prof: The bond between C
and F will break.

00:12:34.918 --> 00:12:38.190
How will we draw a curved arrow
to show that?

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:42.394
Student:  You would draw
a curved arrow starting at the C

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:45.264
and ending at the --
Prof: Not starting at

00:12:45.264 --> 00:12:45.600
the C.
 

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.629
Which are the electrons that
are leaving?

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:50.691
You start with the electrons
that are changing,

00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:51.049
right?
 

00:12:51.049 --> 00:12:51.908
Student:  Yes.
 

00:12:51.908 --> 00:12:56.950
Prof: So where are they,
in this diagram here?

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:01.110
Here, tell me when to stop,
when I hit the electrons?

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.769
Student:  Stop.
 

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:02.428
Prof: Not here.
 

00:13:02.428 --> 00:13:04.748
That's the one that's building
up electrons,

00:13:04.748 --> 00:13:05.179
right?
 

00:13:05.179 --> 00:13:09.039
Student:  There?
 

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:10.918
&gt;
 

00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:12.379
Prof: These are the
electrons that are leaving.

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:19.110
And where do I draw the curved
arrow to, where are they going?

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.450
Okay.
 

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.320
On to the F.
 

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.600
So that's what happens.
 

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.609
When the O-H comes up,
you get water,

00:13:26.609 --> 00:13:29.368
you get ethylene,
the double bond,

00:13:29.368 --> 00:13:30.788
and fluoride.
 

00:13:30.788 --> 00:13:34.429
So this is called,
as you'll see -- just after we

00:13:34.429 --> 00:13:37.995
talk about SN2 substitution,
we'll talk about E2

00:13:37.995 --> 00:13:38.904
elimination.
 

00:13:38.904 --> 00:13:39.740
Right?
 

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.404
And that's what this reaction
is.

00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:41.820
Right?
 

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.753
But that's just an old
category.

00:13:44.753 --> 00:13:45.509
Right?
 

00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:47.288
If we want to make it -- what
it is,

00:13:47.288 --> 00:13:49.750
is the same kind of HOMO/LUMO
interaction,

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.120
except this time we make
two bonds and break

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.299
two bonds,
because of where the nodes

00:13:56.299 --> 00:13:59.186
were, in the LUMO that was being
attacked.

00:13:59.186 --> 00:13:59.820
Right?
 

00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:01.740
There were two antibonding
nodes.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:05.080
We break two bonds.
 

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.429
Okay, does anybody have a
question about this?

00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:09.090
Do you see how it works?
 

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:09.808
Lucas?
 

00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:11.850
Student:  Why did you
stretch C-H again?

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:13.250
Student:  Why did I do
it?

00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:16.000
Because I knew the answer.
 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.928
I knew that this reaction does
this E2 elimination,

00:14:19.928 --> 00:14:23.625
because when I studied organic
chemistry we did E2 elimination

00:14:23.625 --> 00:14:26.110
and never talked about orbitals
at all.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:26.759
Okay?
 

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:27.809
So I knew where I was going.
 

00:14:27.809 --> 00:14:29.418
I knew what really happened.
 

00:14:29.418 --> 00:14:33.072
So I said, how does that
happen, that this is the orbital

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:35.029
that actually gets attacked?
 

00:14:35.029 --> 00:14:37.263
And it's, in fact,
the LUMO+3.

00:14:37.263 --> 00:14:37.879
Right?
 

00:14:37.879 --> 00:14:40.450
Why do the electrons go into
that?

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:44.173
And then I saw that in a
certain phase of vibration of

00:14:44.173 --> 00:14:46.703
the molecule,
when this bond is long,

00:14:46.703 --> 00:14:50.710
and when this bond is
stretched, then it is the LUMO.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:53.977
So when the OH is attacking,
the OH^- is attacking,

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:57.966
it's attacking at a time that
those bonds are stretched at the

00:14:57.966 --> 00:14:58.620
same time.
 

00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.340
Right?
 

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.139
And then they break.
 

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:02.399
Okay?
 

00:15:02.399 --> 00:15:06.671
It's a little bit of chicken
and the egg as to whether the

00:15:06.671 --> 00:15:10.866
electrons going in make them
stretch, or their stretching

00:15:10.866 --> 00:15:13.115
allows the electrons to go in.
 

00:15:13.115 --> 00:15:13.940
Right?
 

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.418
But anyhow, I knew what the
answer was,

00:15:16.418 --> 00:15:19.894
which you wouldn't have known,
if you had just looked at the

00:15:19.894 --> 00:15:23.370
orbitals for the minimum energy
geometry of the molecule.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.433
Okay, now let's look,
let's generalize this to a

00:15:26.433 --> 00:15:29.759
complicated, or fairly
complicated, reaction scheme,

00:15:29.759 --> 00:15:31.519
at least by our lights.
 

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:34.808
So three ammonia molecules
react with chlorine.

00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:37.259
That's called oxidation of
ammonia,

00:15:37.259 --> 00:15:40.879
and it generates hydrazine,
the nitrogen-nitrogen bond,

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:44.129
or actually hydrazinium -- it's
a cation --

00:15:44.129 --> 00:15:47.690
chloride, and ammonium chloride.
 

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:48.870
That looks pretty complicated.
 

00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:50.610
There's a lot of changes going
on.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:51.580
How does it happen?
 

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:52.639
Could we figure it out?
 

00:15:52.639 --> 00:15:54.058
I think you can.
 

00:15:54.058 --> 00:15:57.511
Okay, so in the starting
material I want to find a high

00:15:57.511 --> 00:15:57.960
HOMO.
 

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:06.340
Where do I find it?
 

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:08.418
Sherwin, can you help us?
 

00:16:08.418 --> 00:16:10.546
What do I look -- I want to
find a high HOMO in this

00:16:10.546 --> 00:16:11.379
starting material.
 

00:16:11.379 --> 00:16:14.994
The starting materials are
ammonia and the chlorine

00:16:14.994 --> 00:16:15.788
molecule.
 

00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:19.729
So what about them could give
you a high, unusually

00:16:19.729 --> 00:16:21.620
high-occupied orbital?
 

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.690
Student:  The unmixed
atomic orbital --

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:25.769
Prof: Say it clearly.
 

00:16:25.769 --> 00:16:28.158
Student:  The unmixed
atomic orbital in ammonia.

00:16:28.158 --> 00:16:31.993
Prof: Yes,
the unshared pair of ammonia.

00:16:31.993 --> 00:16:32.658
Right?
 

00:16:32.658 --> 00:16:35.389
N has a bigger nuclear change
than C.

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:40.360
So you might expect the
electrons to be low in energy.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.418
But it never mixed with
anything, so it didn't go down

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:43.740
to become a σ bond.
 

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:45.710
So, unshared pair on ammonia.
 

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:46.809
I'll take that.
 

00:16:46.809 --> 00:16:47.428
Okay.
 

00:16:47.428 --> 00:16:51.610
Now we have to react it with
some -- and unshared pairs are

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.639
often denoted n,
little n.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.750
And I actually don't know why
that is.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.139
It'd be fun to find out.
 

00:17:00.139 --> 00:17:02.298
Okay, now we need a low LUMO.
 

00:17:02.298 --> 00:17:08.942
Anybody got an idea for what a
low LUMO might be in this

00:17:08.942 --> 00:17:10.028
system?
 

00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:13.670
What kind of things give rise
to low LUMOs?

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.619
Student: 
Electronegative things.

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:16.160
Prof: Sam?
 

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.298
Student: 
Electronegative --

00:17:18.298 --> 00:17:19.952
Prof: Electronegative
nuclei.

00:17:19.952 --> 00:17:20.329
Right?
 

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:21.788
Big nuclear charges.
 

00:17:21.788 --> 00:17:24.385
You know, people always say
electronegative,

00:17:24.385 --> 00:17:26.558
but that's the cart and the
horse.

00:17:26.558 --> 00:17:28.528
Why is something
electronegative?

00:17:28.528 --> 00:17:31.307
That means it's a good place
for electrons to go.

00:17:31.307 --> 00:17:31.769
Right?
 

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:33.809
It's because the nuclear charge
is big;

00:17:33.809 --> 00:17:35.210
that's what's fundamental.
 

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.720
Okay, where do we find that
here?

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.750
Student:  In the
chlorine.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:38.538
Prof: The chlorine.
 

00:17:38.538 --> 00:17:41.797
Now which orbital,
associated with the chlorines,

00:17:41.797 --> 00:17:44.578
is going to be unusually low in
energy?

00:17:44.578 --> 00:17:51.328
Does it have a vacant atomic
orbital?

00:17:51.328 --> 00:17:54.423
Bear in mind what's -- chlorine
is in the last column,

00:17:54.423 --> 00:17:54.890
right?
 

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:57.430
So it's just missing one
electron.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:01.247
So a chlorine atom has three
unshared pairs and one odd

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:05.488
electron, which has come with
the other chlorine to make that

00:18:05.488 --> 00:18:05.842
bond.
 

00:18:05.842 --> 00:18:06.618
Right?
 

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:14.859
So after the Cl_2 forms,
where's the vacant orbital?

00:18:14.859 --> 00:18:19.108
Anybody see?
 

00:18:19.108 --> 00:18:22.759
We had two chlorines,
each with this odd electron.

00:18:22.759 --> 00:18:26.970
They came together and you got
a σ bond.

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:29.089
Where's the low LUMO?
 

00:18:29.089 --> 00:18:30.058
Chris?
 

00:18:30.058 --> 00:18:32.819
Student:  It's going be
like a 4s atomic orbital.

00:18:32.819 --> 00:18:34.869
Prof: No.
 

00:18:34.869 --> 00:18:35.868
Kevin?
 

00:18:35.868 --> 00:18:36.858
Student: 
σ*.

00:18:36.858 --> 00:18:38.140
Prof: σ*,
right?

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:39.779
They each had one electron.
 

00:18:39.779 --> 00:18:40.759
Come together, they went down.
 

00:18:40.759 --> 00:18:43.108
But there was a σ*
that went up.

00:18:43.108 --> 00:18:46.910
σ* is usually high
energy, but not in this case

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:50.388
because, as Sam pointed out,
the nuclear charge is big,

00:18:50.388 --> 00:18:51.420
so it's low.
 

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.950
So σ* on chlorine.
 

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:55.890
Okay?
 

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.160
So what kind of reaction are we
going to have?

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:04.720
If we mix σ* of
chlorine with the unshared pair

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.038
on nitrogen?
 

00:19:06.038 --> 00:19:10.468
Have you ever seen a reaction
like this before,

00:19:10.468 --> 00:19:14.896
where you have a
σ* mixing with an

00:19:14.896 --> 00:19:16.630
unshared pair?
 

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.519
Katelyn?
 

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:20.259
Student:  On the last
slide.

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:23.019
Prof: On the last slide
we saw lots of examples.

00:19:23.019 --> 00:19:23.430
Right?
 

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:24.660
And so Katelyn, what happens?
 

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:29.450
Tell me how to draw a curved
arrow here.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:34.250
Student:  The electrons
from the unshared -- no.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:38.472
Prof: The electrons on
the unshared pair of nitrogen,

00:19:38.472 --> 00:19:40.119
that's the high HOMO.
 

00:19:40.119 --> 00:19:41.869
Between what?
 

00:19:41.869 --> 00:19:43.578
Student:  The two Cl's?
 

00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:45.759
Prof: Between the
nitrogen and the chlorine.

00:19:45.759 --> 00:19:48.308
They mix with that vacant
orbital.

00:19:48.308 --> 00:19:51.994
But the ones in the chlorine,
now that's an antibonding

00:19:51.994 --> 00:19:55.338
orbital, σ*,
so a chloride leaves.

00:19:55.338 --> 00:19:58.000
So it's exactly the same
reaction, make and break,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.140
that we saw before.
 

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.028
Okay?
 

00:20:00.028 --> 00:20:05.903
So we get ammonium chloride
"chlorammonium"

00:20:05.903 --> 00:20:09.970
and Cl^-, plus/minus,
net neutral.

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:12.069
We started neutral,
we're still neutral.

00:20:12.069 --> 00:20:12.778
Okay?
 

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:19.057
And now we have one of the
products, the chloride up above

00:20:19.057 --> 00:20:20.160
we have.
 

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.900
Okay, but we also have this
molecule.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.519
Now it has a low LUMO,
so it's reactive.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:36.029
What is the low LUMO?
 

00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:37.400
Yoonjoo?
 

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.880
Student:  The N-H bond.
 

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.920
Prof: That's not what I
would've said.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.893
It turns out to be right,
but it's not what I would've

00:20:48.893 --> 00:20:49.548
said.
 

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:52.502
There are going to be N-H --
it's got to be vacant,

00:20:52.502 --> 00:20:54.630
so what's the name of the
orbital?

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.868
Student: 
σ*

00:20:55.868 --> 00:20:57.529
Prof: σ*
N-H.

00:20:57.529 --> 00:21:04.019
Are there any other
σ*s here?

00:21:04.019 --> 00:21:05.009
Russell?
 

00:21:05.009 --> 00:21:05.670
Student:  Cl.
 

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:06.240
Prof: Cl.
 

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:14.160
Which do you think is going to
be lower, σ* N-Cl

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.460
or σ* N-H?
 

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.538
Kevin?
 

00:21:18.538 --> 00:21:20.038
Student:  I would guess
N-Cl.

00:21:20.038 --> 00:21:21.720
Student:  I would have
too.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:26.420
So the lowest LUMO is for some
HOMO.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.858
Now what are we going to use
for a HOMO?

00:21:27.858 --> 00:21:31.490
We have to have another reagent
for this to react with.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:34.154
Well fortunately that
σ*_ N-H

00:21:34.154 --> 00:21:36.140
is what we're actually going to
use.

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:37.220
Okay?
 

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:38.410
So the high HOMO.
 

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:41.119
We had three ammonias to begin
with.

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:44.230
So we can use another one;
same deal again, right?

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:47.439
So the best reaction,
I think, would be for the

00:21:47.439 --> 00:21:50.160
unshared pair to attack the
chlorine;

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.910
at least that's something that
you could imagine.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:58.680
If that happened,
what would the product be?

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.931
If NH_3 attacked Cl,
it would make an NH_3^(-)Cl

00:22:03.931 --> 00:22:06.390
bond, and lose what?
 

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:07.930
What Russell?
 

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:08.880
Student:  NH_3.
 

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:10.308
Prof: So what about it?
 

00:22:10.308 --> 00:22:11.308
Student:  That's what it
could make there.

00:22:11.308 --> 00:22:14.026
Prof: It could happen
'til the cows come home,

00:22:14.026 --> 00:22:16.741
but the product is the same as
the starting material,

00:22:16.741 --> 00:22:17.838
and no one cares.
 

00:22:17.838 --> 00:22:21.094
It would exchange which
nitrogen is attached to the

00:22:21.094 --> 00:22:21.808
chlorine.
 

00:22:21.808 --> 00:22:23.921
But unless you label them with
isotopes or something,

00:22:23.921 --> 00:22:25.180
you'd have no way of knowing.
 

00:22:25.180 --> 00:22:28.560
So that probably does happen,
or at least I suspect it

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.154
happens some of the time.
 

00:22:30.154 --> 00:22:30.730
Right?
 

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:31.970
But you don't care.
 

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.954
So now we resort to Yoonjoo's
suggestion that we'll use a

00:22:35.954 --> 00:22:39.230
different one so we get a
different product.

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.970
Okay?
 

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.759
So we'll attack the N-H bond.
 

00:22:42.759 --> 00:22:48.470
Now Corey, tell us how to draw
a curved arrow to show this.

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.798
Where's the curved arrow going
to start?

00:22:51.798 --> 00:22:55.519
Student:  On the lone
pair.

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:56.829
Prof: On the lone pair
of the nitrogen.

00:22:56.829 --> 00:22:57.990
And where will it end?
 

00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:59.950
Student:  In between the
N and the H.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:01.319
Prof: In between the N
and the H.

00:23:01.319 --> 00:23:03.068
And what else will happen?
 

00:23:03.068 --> 00:23:04.440
Student:  The bond will
break.

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.420
Prof: Which bond?
 

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.029
What's going to take off with
the electrons?

00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:13.460
Can you see?
 

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.598
Nothing.
 

00:23:14.598 --> 00:23:18.132
Well, that is,
what you lose -- it becomes an

00:23:18.132 --> 00:23:20.380
unshared pair on nitrogen.
 

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.778
N was N^+, right?
 

00:23:22.778 --> 00:23:26.339
Now it gets the electrons that
formerly it was sharing with H.

00:23:26.339 --> 00:23:29.940
So it ends on nitrogen. Right?
 

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.098
So there's the product.
 

00:23:32.098 --> 00:23:37.163
And now I've highlighted in
blue another one of the ultimate

00:23:37.163 --> 00:23:37.936
products.
 

00:23:37.936 --> 00:23:38.710
Right?
 

00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.314
So now we've made ammonium
chloride.

00:23:41.314 --> 00:23:41.910
Right?
 

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.329
We've made one of the products.
 

00:23:44.329 --> 00:23:46.078
But we need the other one.
 

00:23:46.078 --> 00:23:50.180
But we have this product,
from the second reaction.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:24:00.460
Now, what do we have for a low
LUMO here?

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:05.150
Nate, do you have an idea?
 

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.757
You have only σ
bonds, and an unshared pair on

00:24:08.757 --> 00:24:11.617
nitrogen, and three unshared
pairs on chlorine.

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:12.240
Right?
 

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.710
But those are all occupied.
 

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.680
What's a vacant orbital here?
 

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.230
What kind of vacant orbitals do
you get in molecules that have

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:24.318
only σ bonds?
 

00:24:24.318 --> 00:24:25.990
Student:  The p
orbitals.

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:27.459
Prof: No,
the p orbitals are

00:24:27.459 --> 00:24:28.426
filled with electrons here.
 

00:24:28.426 --> 00:24:28.750
Right?
 

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:31.720
So they're not vacant.
 

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.519
Student:  You get a
σ* then.

00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:34.369
You get σ*.
 

00:24:34.369 --> 00:24:35.328
Prof: σ*.
 

00:24:35.328 --> 00:24:38.978
Which σ -- you
have N-H σ* and you

00:24:38.978 --> 00:24:41.390
have N-Cl_
σ*.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.640
Which one do you think is lower?
 

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.869
Student:  The last time
it was the N-H.

00:24:45.869 --> 00:24:49.029
Prof: No, it wasn't.
 

00:24:49.029 --> 00:24:52.595
The one that reacted last time
was the N-H, but it wasn't the

00:24:52.595 --> 00:24:53.130
lowest.
 

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:54.430
The N-Cl was the lowest.
 

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.328
Why didn't we care last time?
 

00:24:57.328 --> 00:24:58.971
Because the product,
when that reacted,

00:24:58.971 --> 00:25:00.569
you got the starting material
back.

00:25:00.569 --> 00:25:02.720
So who cared? Right?
 

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.491
So this time it's the N-Cl.
 

00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:08.730
Right?
 

00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.150
What's the high HOMO we're
going to use?

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:16.329
Student:  NH_3.
 

00:25:16.329 --> 00:25:17.269
Prof: Ah. Wilson?
 

00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:18.420
Student:  The NH_3,
we still --

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.622
Prof: Ah,
we got a third one up there

00:25:21.622 --> 00:25:22.068
still.
 

00:25:22.068 --> 00:25:22.740
Right?
 

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.118
So bring it in.
 

00:25:24.118 --> 00:25:28.990
And there are the curved
arrows, and there's the product.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:33.020
Hydrazine -- hydrazinium,
it's got a proton and there's a

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.619
plus charge -- hydrochloride,
hydrazinium chloride.

00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:37.339
Right?
 

00:25:37.339 --> 00:25:40.450
So that is the last product.
 

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:41.420
So we've done it.
 

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:45.782
So there are three of these
reactions that take place,

00:25:45.782 --> 00:25:48.500
three cycles of make and break.
 

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.730
And notice the difference among
them, right?

00:25:51.730 --> 00:25:54.538
It's always NH_3 that attacks.
 

00:25:54.538 --> 00:25:58.505
But first it attacks chlorine,
then it attacks hydrogen,

00:25:58.505 --> 00:26:00.380
then it attack nitrogen.
 

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:03.395
But it's the same reaction we
talked about on the previous

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:04.190
slide, right?
 

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:06.490
Make and break.
 

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:09.858
Okay, now we're going to look
at four functional groups:

00:26:09.858 --> 00:26:11.819
The C double bond O,
carbonyl;

00:26:11.819 --> 00:26:14.160
amide;
carboxylic acid;

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.818
and alkyl lithium.
 

00:26:15.818 --> 00:26:17.871
And after that,
we'll have done what we wanted

00:26:17.871 --> 00:26:19.328
to do about functional groups.
 

00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:22.054
Although it will still be in
your court to do functional

00:26:22.054 --> 00:26:23.954
groups,
because you have these Wikis,

00:26:23.954 --> 00:26:26.862
to do the same kind of analysis
on the functional groups that

00:26:26.862 --> 00:26:30.430
we're doing here,
on these four functional groups.

00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:31.680
And those are due Thursday.
 

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.819
And almost all of them are
signed up for.

00:26:33.819 --> 00:26:35.098
There are just a few more to do.
 

00:26:35.098 --> 00:26:36.798
So if you want a choice,
get there quickly,

00:26:36.798 --> 00:26:38.450
because I'll assign them this
afternoon,

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.538
I think, because we're almost
at the end,

00:26:40.538 --> 00:26:44.358
and I have to make sure
everything gets covered.

00:26:44.358 --> 00:26:47.538
Okay, so the carbonyl group,
C=O double bond.

00:26:47.538 --> 00:26:50.443
This is probably the most
important functional group in

00:26:50.443 --> 00:26:51.519
organic chemistry.
 

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:53.250
Why is it so important?
 

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:57.238
(a) Because it's strong,
so it gives stable compounds,

00:26:57.238 --> 00:26:58.970
low energy compounds.
 

00:26:58.970 --> 00:27:00.960
So you have a lot of carbonyl
groups.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:04.852
But, paradoxically,
it's not only strong,

00:27:04.852 --> 00:27:07.088
but it reacts easily.
 

00:27:07.088 --> 00:27:10.788
So it's easy to make things
from carbonyls.

00:27:10.788 --> 00:27:13.012
Okay, that sounds
contradictory,

00:27:13.012 --> 00:27:16.240
that it should be both stable
and reactive;

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.160
but it is, and we'll see why.
 

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.720
So let's look at the shape of
the frontier orbitals.

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:26.721
There are six valence electron
pairs in formaldehyde,

00:27:26.721 --> 00:27:29.318
shown here from the side.
 

00:27:29.318 --> 00:27:32.720
And we could show the molecular
orbitals, right?;

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:36.045
the Chladni style,
plum-pudding molecular

00:27:36.045 --> 00:27:36.960
orbitals.
 

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:42.448
So the lowest one is 1s,
or 2s if you want to

00:27:42.448 --> 00:27:43.867
count the core.
 

00:27:43.867 --> 00:27:44.720
Right?
 

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.078
Which is mostly on the oxygen,
a little bit on carbon.

00:27:49.078 --> 00:27:51.661
And then there's the
2p_x, 2_y_

00:27:51.661 --> 00:27:54.348
and 2p_z,
as plum pudding orbitals.

00:27:54.348 --> 00:27:57.557
And then there's this 3s
orbital and this

00:27:57.557 --> 00:27:59.880
3d_xy_ orbital.
 

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.852
But let's look a little more
closely at that,

00:28:02.852 --> 00:28:06.230
from the point of view of
pairwise interactions.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.880
What things interacted with one
another to give these?

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.865
So let's do the kind of
pairwise mixing we've been

00:28:11.865 --> 00:28:12.838
talking about.
 

00:28:12.838 --> 00:28:16.546
There's the HOMO,
an older style picture of the

00:28:16.546 --> 00:28:19.769
HOMO, the one that's called
3d_xy,

00:28:19.769 --> 00:28:21.140
on the right.
 

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.971
And this is drawn at a -- it
was based on a different

00:28:23.971 --> 00:28:27.130
calculation and it's drawn at a
different contour level.

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:34.178
But you can see what it -- what
is it mostly,

00:28:34.178 --> 00:28:35.940
the HOMO?
 

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:40.385
If you had to give a simple
name to it, what would you call

00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:44.910
it, if you neglected the little
tiny pieces on the right?

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:45.829
What does it look like?
 

00:28:45.829 --> 00:28:46.779
Sherwin?
 

00:28:46.779 --> 00:28:47.950
Student:  p
orbital on oxygen.

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.578
Prof: It's a p
orbital on oxygen,

00:28:49.578 --> 00:28:50.920
an unshared pair of oxygen,
mostly,

00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.828
although it is mixed a little
bit with something else.

00:28:53.828 --> 00:28:57.846
Now, to see what else it's
mixed with, we can go down the

00:28:57.846 --> 00:29:01.002
list by three steps and look at
that orbital,

00:29:01.002 --> 00:29:03.730
the one that's called
2p_y.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:08.036
Because it also has that little
bit of oxygen in it,

00:29:08.036 --> 00:29:10.568
but more of the other stuff.
 

00:29:10.568 --> 00:29:13.769
Now let's look at nodes in
these things.

00:29:13.769 --> 00:29:17.186
There's nodes that are nodes of
atomic orbitals,

00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:19.660
of the oxygen and of the
carbon;

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.328
they bisect the molecule.
 

00:29:21.328 --> 00:29:23.364
Those don't have to do with
bonding.

00:29:23.364 --> 00:29:23.828
Right?
 

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:29.230
But the one on the top also has
an antibonding node.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:33.019
Can you see where that is?
 

00:29:33.019 --> 00:29:34.130
Shai?
 

00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:36.519
Student:  Between the
carbon and the oxygen.

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:38.323
Prof: Between the carbon
and the oxygen,

00:29:38.323 --> 00:29:39.500
there's an antibonding node.
 

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:45.890
So this is a favorable and an
unfavorable combination of,

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:48.027
in the front,
oxygen, the front left is

00:29:48.027 --> 00:29:50.268
oxygen,
and in the back right is some

00:29:50.268 --> 00:29:51.308
sort of C-H bond.
 

00:29:51.308 --> 00:29:55.299
So those molecular orbitals are
made by combining 2p of

00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:57.460
oxygen with σ
C-H;

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:00.609
in fact two σ C-Hs.
 

00:30:00.609 --> 00:30:01.180
Okay?
 

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:07.873
Now, which one is lower in
energy, the unshared pair on

00:30:07.873 --> 00:30:11.838
oxygen, or σ
C-H?

00:30:11.838 --> 00:30:14.400
Notice that the oxygen has
something going for it,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.058
which is a big nuclear charge,
but the C-H has something going

00:30:18.058 --> 00:30:20.291
for it,
which is the bonding of the

00:30:20.291 --> 00:30:23.799
C-H, which lowered it from where
carbon and hydrogen atomic

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:25.068
orbitals would be.
 

00:30:25.068 --> 00:30:28.368
Which one is lower,
the 2p of oxygen or

00:30:28.368 --> 00:30:29.910
σ C-H?
 

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:32.910
Which wins?
 

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:37.160
Can you tell by looking at this?
 

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.308
Angela?
 

00:30:38.308 --> 00:30:42.416
Student: σ
C-H_ is lower

00:30:42.416 --> 00:30:46.990
because the one on the bottom
has less nodes than the one on

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.920
the top.
 

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.630
Prof: Right.
 

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:52.519
The favorable combination,
which looks mostly like the

00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:55.088
lower one, looks mostly like
C-H;

00:30:55.088 --> 00:30:57.224
and the unfavorable one,
the one that went up,

00:30:57.224 --> 00:30:58.269
looks mostly like O.
 

00:30:58.269 --> 00:31:01.551
So clearly the σ
C-H_ is lower in

00:31:01.551 --> 00:31:03.818
energy than the 2p of
oxygen.

00:31:03.818 --> 00:31:06.546
Okay, now let's look at the
LUMO, up on top,

00:31:06.546 --> 00:31:08.828
in the plum pudding column,
right?

00:31:08.828 --> 00:31:10.920
And here's another version of
that.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.269
And you can see what it is.
 

00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:16.623
It's made up of a p
orbital on oxygen and a p

00:31:16.623 --> 00:31:17.779
orbital on carbon.
 

00:31:17.779 --> 00:31:20.710
That's an atomic orbital node.
 

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:22.470
It has nothing to do with the
bonding.

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:26.460
But there is an antibonding
node between them.

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.170
Right?
 

00:31:27.170 --> 00:31:30.420
So this is the π*
orbital;

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:34.487
not the occupied one but the
vacant orbital,

00:31:34.487 --> 00:31:35.337
the LUMO.
 

00:31:35.337 --> 00:31:36.190
Right?
 

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:38.289
There's poor overlap because
it's π*;

00:31:38.289 --> 00:31:40.450
that's why it's unusually low.
 

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:43.698
And it's also unusually low
compared to C,

00:31:43.698 --> 00:31:48.690
C-C, because it's got an oxygen
in it, a high nuclear charge.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:51.770
So poor energy match;
2p O_ is lower

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:54.380
in energy than the 2p of
carbon.

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:55.880
Okay?
 

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.048
And there -- we're going to
show this on the next slide,

00:31:59.048 --> 00:32:01.420
those two -- but the top one,
you see,

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:07.019
is the favorable combination of
2p O and 2p_z;

00:32:07.019 --> 00:32:10.569
the one of which this is the
unfavorable combination.

00:32:10.569 --> 00:32:12.380
But it's not the HOMO, right?
 

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.707
The HOMO is that unshared pair
on oxygen, which is the dominant

00:32:17.707 --> 00:32:19.769
thing in 3d_xy.
 

00:32:19.769 --> 00:32:21.269
Okay, so now let's look at
these.

00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:24.240
There's the C=O π
bonding orbital.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.059
Now which one should that be
big on?

00:32:27.059 --> 00:32:28.650
Don't look at it.
 

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.784
Which one should the
π -- the favorable

00:32:31.784 --> 00:32:35.441
combination of p on
oxygen and p on carbon,

00:32:35.441 --> 00:32:37.400
which should it be big on?
 

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.305
There's p on oxygen,
p on carbon,

00:32:40.305 --> 00:32:42.029
they mix;
π overlap,

00:32:42.029 --> 00:32:44.708
not too much overlap,
so they don't go so much up and

00:32:44.708 --> 00:32:45.118
down.
 

00:32:45.118 --> 00:32:47.474
But what does this,
the bonding one,

00:32:47.474 --> 00:32:49.630
what does it mostly look like?
 

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:50.308
Student: Oxygen.
 

00:32:50.308 --> 00:32:51.548
Prof: It should look
mostly like oxygen.

00:32:51.548 --> 00:32:54.130
When you look at this picture
it doesn't look that way.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:57.029
That's because of which contour
we drew.

00:32:57.029 --> 00:33:00.140
Because oxygen holds its
electrons closer.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.118
So by the time you get out to a
certain low --

00:33:03.118 --> 00:33:07.858
so you get through most of the
electron density of oxygen,

00:33:07.858 --> 00:33:11.339
as you go out one contour by
the other of the onion,

00:33:11.339 --> 00:33:15.118
that's the oxygen;
there are more electrons inside.

00:33:15.118 --> 00:33:19.038
So indeed it does have more
electron density on oxygen than

00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:22.077
it does on carbon,
but it doesn't show well in

00:33:22.077 --> 00:33:23.970
this particular contour.
 

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:25.450
Anyhow, that's the π
bonding.

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:29.588
And this one is a different
unshared pair on Oxygen.

00:33:29.588 --> 00:33:31.393
And that's mostly a
p-rich,

00:33:31.393 --> 00:33:34.289
hybrid atomic orbital of
oxygen, but it's got a little

00:33:34.289 --> 00:33:37.568
bit of the C-H bonding and it's
a favorable combination;

00:33:37.568 --> 00:33:41.390
there's a little bit of
favorable bonding between there.

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:46.048
Okay, but the nodes that you
see in this, in neither orbital

00:33:46.048 --> 00:33:48.259
are the nodes antibonding.
 

00:33:48.259 --> 00:33:50.980
They're always the nodes that
go through atoms.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:52.259
They're part of atomic orbitals.
 

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:55.790
These are bonding orbitals,
the occupied ones,

00:33:55.790 --> 00:33:57.910
as you expect them to be.
 

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:00.740
Okay, but now let's look at
that LUMO, that vacant orbital,

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.058
the π* orbital.
 

00:34:02.058 --> 00:34:06.805
What direction should a high
energy HOMO approach this,

00:34:06.805 --> 00:34:09.090
in order to mix with it?
 

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:11.170
So it has to get good overlap
as it comes in,

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:15.920
and not run into the other
nuclei, or the other electron

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.670
density associated with other
orbitals on the way in.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.510
Okay, well here are three
possibilities.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:26.460
You could attack from within
the plane, from the oxygen end;

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.489
from within the plane toward
the carbon;

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:31.701
or from straight up,
halfway between carbon and

00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:32.329
oxygen.
 

00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:36.851
How do those look as ways for
an orbital to come in and

00:34:36.851 --> 00:34:37.690
overlap?
 

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:39.550
Suppose it came from the right.
 

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:43.114
Suppose you had a big ball,
like OH^-, coming in along that

00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:44.530
arrow from the right?
 

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:47.518
You going to get good overlap?
 

00:34:47.518 --> 00:34:49.429
What would you call that
situation?

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.519
Student:  Orthogonal.
 

00:34:50.519 --> 00:34:52.909
Prof: Orthogonal, right?
 

00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:55.259
So you're not going to get
overlap -- how about if you come

00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:56.840
from the left,
the arrow on the left?

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.909
Student:  It's also --
Prof: That's also going

00:34:58.909 --> 00:34:59.420
to be orthogonal.
 

00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:03.050
How about if you come from the
top?

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:06.128
It's not precisely orthogonal,
but it's pretty close to

00:35:06.128 --> 00:35:06.869
orthogonal.
 

00:35:06.869 --> 00:35:09.000
You have both positive and
negative overlap.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.539
So in fact none of those are
good.

00:35:12.539 --> 00:35:13.900
Now here are two other
possibilities.

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:17.083
You could attack the oxygen on
the top, or you could attack the

00:35:17.083 --> 00:35:18.110
carbon on the top.
 

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.920
Which of those do you think
looks better?

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.559
Student:  Carbon.
 

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:23.010
Prof: Carbon.
 

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:23.480
Why?
 

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:23.969
Angela?
 

00:35:23.969 --> 00:35:25.010
Student:  It's bigger.
 

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:26.039
Prof: Because it's
bigger.

00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:29.210
Okay, so I'd say that one's
smaller, so forget that.

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:30.489
So come in from the carbon.
 

00:35:30.489 --> 00:35:33.380
Okay, so here's a better
drawing of that orbital.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.813
And we want to come in actually
from that direction,

00:35:37.813 --> 00:35:40.751
at a certain angle;
not 90º,

00:35:40.751 --> 00:35:44.170
with respect to the
oxygen-carbon bond.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.239
Now why come in from that angle?
 

00:35:46.239 --> 00:35:49.309
Why not come straight down on
top?

00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:53.039
Student:  You get less
overlap with the oxygen.

00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:55.135
Prof: There are the
nodes.

00:35:55.135 --> 00:35:55.659
Right?
 

00:35:55.659 --> 00:35:57.170
This is furthest from the node.
 

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:00.851
So you can overlap the nodes
you want to overlap with,

00:36:00.851 --> 00:36:03.215
without getting near the blue
ones.

00:36:03.215 --> 00:36:03.909
Right?
 

00:36:03.909 --> 00:36:05.929
So you should come in at a
certain angle.

00:36:05.929 --> 00:36:08.179
Now, there's a prediction.
 

00:36:08.179 --> 00:36:12.119
Is it true?
 

00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:16.251
So what we're going to do this
is rotate this so the

00:36:16.251 --> 00:36:19.329
orientation corresponds to a
graph,

00:36:19.329 --> 00:36:25.550
that appeared in a paper by
Dunitz and Bürgi in 1983,

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:27.090
when they were analyzing this.
 

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:28.309
Now what did they do?
 

00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:31.920
They looked at X-ray crystal
structures of many,

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.469
many crystals that had both a
nitrogen in it --

00:36:35.469 --> 00:36:39.672
so the unshared pair -- and
they had a carbon-oxygen double

00:36:39.672 --> 00:36:40.179
bond.
 

00:36:40.179 --> 00:36:42.978
And they looked to see,
in many, many different

00:36:42.978 --> 00:36:46.210
structures,
how those atoms are arranged,

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:51.135
because they must be arranged
in a low energy way next to one

00:36:51.135 --> 00:36:52.039
another.
 

00:36:52.039 --> 00:36:52.440
Okay?
 

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.730
That's the way they would pack
in the crystal.

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.500
Okay, so now how is this
diagram made?

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:01.840
Well notice that the carbon and
oxygen are drawn there.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.070
So that's the carbon and
oxygen, and they're made --

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.548
so all these different
crystals, some have the group

00:37:06.548 --> 00:37:08.186
oriented this way,
some this way,

00:37:08.186 --> 00:37:09.510
some this way,
some this way.

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.646
So you rotate all those
crystals so that their carbons

00:37:12.646 --> 00:37:16.139
are superimposed with one
another, in all the structures;

00:37:16.139 --> 00:37:20.394
the carbons are all there,
and the oxygen is along this

00:37:20.394 --> 00:37:24.021
particular line,
which lies in the plane of the

00:37:24.021 --> 00:37:24.572
screen.
 

00:37:24.572 --> 00:37:25.440
Right?
 

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:28.967
And then there are things
attached to it,

00:37:28.967 --> 00:37:32.925
which are R groups;
an R group -- that is whatever

00:37:32.925 --> 00:37:36.856
group, hydrogen or carbon or
something -- attached to the

00:37:36.856 --> 00:37:37.559
carbon.
 

00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:41.414
There's one in front of the
plane and one behind the plane.

00:37:41.414 --> 00:37:41.880
Okay?
 

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:45.306
So we rotate all these
different structures around that

00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:46.639
carbon-oxygen bond.
 

00:37:46.639 --> 00:37:50.110
So those things are all one
hiding the other one;

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:52.780
the R in front hides the R
behind.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.175
And now we look,
with that orientation,

00:37:56.175 --> 00:37:59.570
to see where the nitrogen is
nearby.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:03.670
And those dots up on the top
show in many different

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.623
structures, labeled A,
B, C, D, E, F,

00:38:06.623 --> 00:38:08.920
G, H, I -- no J -- K,
L.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.539
Okay?
 

00:38:09.539 --> 00:38:11.820
In all those different
structures where's the nitrogen?

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.452
So in structure G,
a particular compound,

00:38:15.452 --> 00:38:19.719
the nitrogen is where the blue
dot is on top.

00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:23.619
The carbon is -- all the
carbons are always there.

00:38:23.619 --> 00:38:25.780
That's the origin, right?
 

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.989
Here.
 

00:38:26.989 --> 00:38:28.980
The oxygens are along this line.
 

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.498
So the oxygen is along that
line and at that position,

00:38:31.498 --> 00:38:32.260
that distance.
 

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:35.750
And the R groups are bent down
a little bit from being planar.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.000
One is here and the other one
is behind.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:40.619
Okay?
 

00:38:40.619 --> 00:38:44.519
Okay, but now let's go G,
H, I, K, L.

00:38:44.519 --> 00:38:54.420
G, H, I, K, L.
 

00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:57.679
Do you see what happens?
 

00:38:57.679 --> 00:38:58.840
Let's go back.
 

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.210
K, I, H, G.
 

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:05.820
These are five different
crystal structures.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:06.780
But look again.
 

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.690
So the nitrogen comes down,
from one structure to the next.

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:18.519
What happens to the R's,
as the nitrogen comes down?

00:39:18.519 --> 00:39:20.780
Student:  They move away.
 

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.889
Prof: Right,
the R's bend down.

00:39:22.889 --> 00:39:26.461
So the nitrogen -- the carbon,
pardon me, in the middle,

00:39:26.461 --> 00:39:28.800
becomes pyramidal rather than
planar.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.579
Back up.
 

00:39:29.579 --> 00:39:33.460
What happens to the oxygen as
we do this?

00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:46.360
There's G, H, I, K, L.***Right?
 

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:47.309
Okay, so here's what happened.
 

00:39:47.309 --> 00:39:49.657
The nitrogen moves down,
the Rs bend down,

00:39:49.657 --> 00:39:51.260
and the oxygen moves away.
 

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:53.675
Why does the oxygen move away
from the carbon,

00:39:53.675 --> 00:39:56.039
from a theoretical,
orbital point of view?

00:39:56.039 --> 00:39:59.239
Where are you putting electrons?
 

00:39:59.239 --> 00:40:02.940
Where are you putting the
electrons here,

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.179
when you put them into this
LUMO?

00:40:06.179 --> 00:40:09.291
Into an orbital that's
antibonding between carbon and

00:40:09.291 --> 00:40:09.829
oxygen.
 

00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:12.840
So the oxygen stretches away
from the carbon.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:13.340
Kevin?
 

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:16.094
Student:  On the right
side of the screen,

00:40:16.094 --> 00:40:17.989
the length units,
what is that?

00:40:17.989 --> 00:40:18.880
Prof: That's
Ångstroms.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.960
So it's zero is the origin;
that's where the carbon is.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:27.420
And there's one Ångstrom,
1,2, 3.

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:29.677
So they start three -- the
nitrogen starts three

00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:33.152
Ångstroms from the carbon,
and as it comes in it gets to

00:40:33.152 --> 00:40:35.130
be within about 1.6 or
something.

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:36.119
And I forget.
 

00:40:36.119 --> 00:40:39.755
I'm guessing that an actual
bond between that nitrogen and

00:40:39.755 --> 00:40:43.010
carbon is probably the order of
1.3 or something;

00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:44.139
I'm not actually sure it is.
 

00:40:44.139 --> 00:40:45.969
So they haven't quite bonded.
 

00:40:45.969 --> 00:40:50.567
But it's following the pathway
of reaction, when you look at a

00:40:50.567 --> 00:40:53.280
lot of these different
structures.

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:53.840
Okay?
 

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.724
Now that angle,
110º, along the path that

00:40:57.724 --> 00:41:02.300
they follow, is called the
Bürgi-Dunitz Angle;

00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.193
that's the guys who did the
paper, Hans-Beat Bürgi and

00:41:06.193 --> 00:41:08.139
Jack Dunitz in Switzerland.
 

00:41:08.139 --> 00:41:13.873
So there is a bunch of what we
might consider snapshots of a

00:41:13.873 --> 00:41:17.079
reaction actually taking place.
 

00:41:17.079 --> 00:41:22.231
And you can see that there's a
well-defined angle from which

00:41:22.231 --> 00:41:27.210
the nitrogen approaches that
LUMO, as it mixes with it.

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:33.210
Now, resonance is
intramolecular HOMO/LUMO mixing.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:35.423
We've looked here at
intermolecular,

00:41:35.423 --> 00:41:36.690
which is reaction.
 

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:39.414
But next time we'll go on to
this slide and look at the

00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:42.239
analogous thing that happens
within a molecule.

00:41:42.239 --> 00:41:43.500
Okay.

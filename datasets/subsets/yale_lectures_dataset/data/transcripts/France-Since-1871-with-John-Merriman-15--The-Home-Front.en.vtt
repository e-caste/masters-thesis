00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.692
Professor John Merriman:
I'll tell you my favorite

00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:05.736
midterm story.
Maybe one or two of you have

00:00:05.736 --> 00:00:08.426
heard this before.
The point of this is that you

00:00:08.426 --> 00:00:11.763
don't screw around with midterms
because people put their game

00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:13.937
faces on;
you're going to have your game

00:00:13.937 --> 00:00:16.854
faces on, on Monday.
But maybe ten years ago

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:21.771
somebody in the first half of
this class raised their hand the

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:24.754
day before,
the lecture before the midterm

00:00:24.754 --> 00:00:28.091
and said, oddly enough,
"what language will the midterm

00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:30.239
be in?"
And this is before we had

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.708
French-speaking sections.
So, I don't know,

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:35.343
you ask a question that was a
fairly silly question,

00:00:35.343 --> 00:00:38.750
you give a fairly silly answer.
So, I said "Croatian."

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.489
And, so, then I started
thinking, well I'll play a

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.410
little joke on them;
"ha-ha, don't screw around with

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.807
midterms."
And, so, I have a colleague who

00:00:46.807 --> 00:00:49.764
is Croatian and so I made up the
following question,

00:00:49.764 --> 00:00:51.910
which he translated into
Croatian.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.472
And, so, the test,
you come into the test and you

00:00:54.472 --> 00:00:57.992
get your basic piece of paper,
it says answer one of the

00:00:57.992 --> 00:01:01.979
following two questions,
and there's a third question,

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.680
in Croatian,
with a translation by Ivo

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.611
Banac.
And the question was mine,

00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:09.439
I take full credit or discredit
for this.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.693
The question was,
"the population of Paris in

00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:23.254
1831 was 630,721 people;
name these people,

00:01:23.254 --> 00:01:30.330
and in a second column list
those who owned more than one

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.434
apartment."
So, if you got a question that

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:39.024
said the population of Paris was
630,731, name these people,

00:01:39.024 --> 00:01:44.590
would you answer that question?
Three people did.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.146
So you have to think,
what have they been drinking,

00:01:48.146 --> 00:01:52.620
what have they been smoking?
And, so, what do we do?

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.238
I'm screwing around with a
midterm, and we have three blue

00:01:56.238 --> 00:01:59.540
books answering question number
three in Croatian;

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.109
not responding in Croatian,
that would be extra credit.

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.411
And the first person says,
well, logically enough--people

00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:08.877
must panic.
I must have done this too when

00:02:08.877 --> 00:02:12.008
I showed up late for midterms or
whatever, if I remembered to go,

00:02:12.008 --> 00:02:14.210
you just--you panic and you
start writing.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.704
And the first person said,
"well, Merriman,

00:02:15.704 --> 00:02:17.270
he's real interested in social
geography,"

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.640
so he wrote a pretty coherent
essay about how the rich people

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.123
live in the west and the poorer
people live in the east and the

00:02:24.123 --> 00:02:28.046
wealthier people in the center,
and the poor people on the

00:02:28.046 --> 00:02:31.983
periphery."
So, we graded that as a real

00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:35.247
answer.
Person number two takes pen--I

00:02:35.247 --> 00:02:39.483
don't remember male or
female--person number two takes

00:02:39.483 --> 00:02:43.479
pen and starts writing a column:
Albert Hassin,

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.765
Jean Claude,
Albert Hassin,

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:53.590
Jean Marie, Albert Hassin,
Xavier--and writes names,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.807
writes French names;
sitting there for forty-five

00:02:59.807 --> 00:03:05.590
minutes writing names.
What do you do with that?

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.680
Call psychiatric services,
I don't know.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.639
I got to deal with this stuff,
you know.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:16.298
And, so, the third person says,
"Question Number Three," and

00:03:16.298 --> 00:03:20.484
then just sort of just drooled
all over the blue book,

00:03:20.484 --> 00:03:24.673
for about the next half hour.
And, so, we get these things,

00:03:24.673 --> 00:03:27.677
get this soggy blue book,
and you get one with a kind of

00:03:27.677 --> 00:03:30.789
a half-assed but still okay
essay on social geography,

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:32.120
and you get the third,
it's a bunch of names.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.949
So, what do you?
How do you grade that?

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.901
We had a council of--a meeting
to discuss this,

00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.261
and I don't know what we did.
I know we gave the first person

00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:46.393
some sort of B+ for the essay,
and number two I think I

00:03:46.393 --> 00:03:50.906
convoked the person and maybe
called the college dean to say

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:53.590
"Ça va?
Ça ne vas pas?

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.750
Ça marche?
Ça ne marche pas?

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.801
On a un petit problème
quand même,

00:03:57.801 --> 00:04:00.209
nous."  Anyway,
I don't mean to screw around

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.060
with your midterm.
Sorry?

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.280
Student: How many names
did he get through?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.479
Professor John Merriman:
 Oh, I guess about maybe--I

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.787
tore it up at the end.
There was probably about

00:04:07.787 --> 00:04:11.105
seventeen or eighteen names,
and they were in alphabetical

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:14.004
order.
So, it wasn't that the midterm

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:17.341
was a total loss.
But that's the last time I

00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:21.510
screw around with midterms.
Brian, mon brave,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.995
are your people getting this in
French, the midterm,

00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:28.683
or in English?
Brian: Well,

00:04:28.683 --> 00:04:31.949
they're getting the French
Department to do French.

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.858
Professor John Merriman:
No, but the exam,

00:04:33.858 --> 00:04:36.243
when we do the exam in a few
minutes, are we going to do that

00:04:36.243 --> 00:04:39.390
in French?
Okay, voilà.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.949
So, let's start.
Where was I?

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:47.024
I got taken out there a little
bit here, thinking about those

00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:51.302
old times.
I want today to talk about 1917

00:04:51.302 --> 00:04:57.110
and 1918, and talk a little bit
about the mutinies.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.915
The mutinies have to be seen in
the context, of the course,

00:05:00.915 --> 00:05:04.393
in all these assaults,
but above all the Battle of the

00:05:04.393 --> 00:05:08.457
Somme.
And the Battle of the Somme,

00:05:08.457 --> 00:05:14.662
which began on July 1st,
1916 was the darkest moment

00:05:14.662 --> 00:05:19.529
certainly in four years of dark
days.

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:23.115
On the first day of the Battle
of the Somme--I always give

00:05:23.115 --> 00:05:26.632
these statistics,
they're so interesting--the

00:05:26.632 --> 00:05:31.278
first day, the 1st of July,
1916, almost 40,000 British

00:05:31.278 --> 00:05:36.019
soldiers were killed in one day,
and--I mean 40,000,

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:40.481
sorry, were wounded,
and 20,000 were killed on the

00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:44.752
very first day.
There was a casualty for every

00:05:44.752 --> 00:05:48.000
half meter of the entire front
line;

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.190
so, one casualty for every half
meter of the front line.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.102
And I gave this statistic the
first day, when I was kind of

00:05:56.102 --> 00:05:57.860
giving an overview of the
course,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.726
but there were more British
soldiers killed or seriously

00:06:01.726 --> 00:06:06.085
wounded in the first three days
of the Battle of the Somme than

00:06:06.085 --> 00:06:09.530
there were Americans killed in
World War One,

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:17.547
Korea, and Vietnam combined.
And you can include the 4,000

00:06:17.547 --> 00:06:23.420
that had been killed in this
current third war.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.053
So, those are phenomenal losses.
And, so, the question again

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:31.174
when you look at the poisoning
of the political atmosphere and

00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:34.956
the absence of able leadership
in Europe in the 1920s and

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:37.639
1930s,
where were they?

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:40.447
In the case of Britain they
were, as that poem went,

00:06:40.447 --> 00:06:43.639
hung up on that old barbed
wire, because they were dead.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.674
And sometimes it's easy--and
British society is such a class

00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:51.709
society, and it's easy to kind
of poke fun at Oxbridge folks

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:55.244
going to their common room,
and then going off to

00:06:55.244 --> 00:06:58.879
machinegun Indian insurgents,
and this sort of thing.

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:04.403
But the flower of British youth
perished and the flower of other

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:07.560
countries' youth during this
time.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.519
And, so, the mutinies have to
be seen in that context;

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:17.329
and I'll come back to them in
awhile.

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:23.255
Now, 1917 is the crucial year,
really, in determining the

00:07:23.255 --> 00:07:28.970
outcome of a war that seemed
like it was going to go on

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.862
forever;
forever, not defined by truly

00:07:32.862 --> 00:07:38.649
forever, but that in the end of
1917 and the beginning of 1918,

00:07:38.649 --> 00:07:41.927
into March--well,
after they slow down the

00:07:41.927 --> 00:07:46.643
Ludendorff offensive in 1918,
the military planners begin to

00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:50.079
think that they'll win the war
in 1920,

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:55.750
1921 maybe, if all went
spectacularly well in 1919.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:08:00.067
And, of course,
as so many people died to win a

00:08:00.067 --> 00:08:03.540
few hundred meters,
or a kilometer,

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.925
or two kilometers,
or three kilometers at best,

00:08:05.925 --> 00:08:08.881
there were wags who said well
at this rate we'll reach the

00:08:08.881 --> 00:08:11.022
Rhine,
somebody figured out,

00:08:11.022 --> 00:08:14.343
by the year 2007,
which is where we are now,

00:08:14.343 --> 00:08:17.540
more or less,
if I remember that statistic.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:22.149
But two things happen in 1917
that are essential.

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:25.629
One is that the Bolshevik
Revolution comes along;

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:28.644
but first the revolution in
February where the people of St.

00:08:28.644 --> 00:08:31.658
Petersberg wake up and find
that the emperor has no clothes,

00:08:31.658 --> 00:08:33.600
that there's police but no
troops,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.956
and the bread lines are long,
and the czarist autocracy

00:08:38.956 --> 00:08:44.611
falls, leading to that sort of
power vacuum and Kerensky's

00:08:44.611 --> 00:08:48.340
provisional government.
And, of course,

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.190
in October the Bolsheviks,
after one attempt had failed,

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:56.018
the Bolsheviks seize power.
And at that point the war

00:08:56.018 --> 00:08:59.129
changes dimensions dramatically
in the east.

00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:03.653
Russia is still in the war
until the Treaty of

00:09:03.653 --> 00:09:08.764
Brest-Litovsk in March of 1918.
But the propaganda,

00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:14.243
which was more than that of
war, bread, and peace--that's a

00:09:14.243 --> 00:09:19.815
motto to live by--means that
you've got a de-acceleration in

00:09:19.815 --> 00:09:25.010
the Russian war effort and
you've got massive desertions

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.607
from the Russian Army.
Now, one of the amazing things

00:09:29.607 --> 00:09:33.197
is that the desertion rate was
so low, compared to what you

00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:36.867
think would happen.
And it is rather amazing that

00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:41.641
the Russians were able to hold
on, again, just as the Germans

00:09:41.641 --> 00:09:45.700
were close to Paris,
particularly in March 1918;

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.223
the German forces are also
quite close to Petrograd,

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:55.013
that St.
Petersberg had been renamed

00:09:55.013 --> 00:09:59.669
because Petrograd sounded more
Russian.

00:09:59.669 --> 00:10:03.274
But the other thing that
changes the outcome of the war

00:10:03.274 --> 00:10:08.930
is that the Americans come in.
And in the United States--the

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:15.000
United States were supposedly
neutral until 1917,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.251
but outside of places with
strong German populations,

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:21.771
for example Philadelphia,
Milwaukee, Chicago,

00:10:21.771 --> 00:10:26.204
the majority of Americans
supported the Allies,

00:10:26.204 --> 00:10:31.026
as defined by the British,
the French and the Russians,

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:34.500
and particularly through the
British component.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.940
But it wasn't really that that
brings the Americans into the

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.560
war.
The German High Command--to

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.149
make again one of these
interesting long stories very,

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:45.292
very short--had decided that
the only way that they could win

00:10:45.292 --> 00:10:47.440
is to knock the British out of
the war,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.018
and the way that they could
knock the British out of the war

00:10:52.018 --> 00:10:54.889
is to stop the supply of
munitions,

00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:57.715
of food, of grain,
of almost anything else you

00:10:57.715 --> 00:10:59.850
could imagine,
to Great Britain.

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:01.669
Now, how are you going to do
that?

00:11:01.669 --> 00:11:05.425
Well the way you're going to do
that is with a campaign of

00:11:05.425 --> 00:11:09.721
unrestricted submarine warfare,
the famous U-boats,

00:11:09.721 --> 00:11:14.299
that sink an incredible number
of ships.

00:11:14.299 --> 00:11:20.121
And the German government goes
down, sends representatives down

00:11:20.121 --> 00:11:24.440
to the docks in New York and to
other ports,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.436
Boston and other places,
and they put up warnings saying

00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:30.704
that the civilian passengers or
any other Americans who go on

00:11:30.704 --> 00:11:34.190
ships ought to know that they're
entering a war zone and could be

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.777
sunk.
And the German U-boats sink

00:11:37.777 --> 00:11:41.649
some ships with Americans on
them.

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:44.687
The most dramatic event was the
sinking of the Lusitania,

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:46.639
which I'm sure you all know
about,

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.880
in which lots of Americans--I
can't remember how many,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.360
but it was hundreds and
hundreds;

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.925
it might've even been 1,000;
I apologize for not have the

00:11:53.925 --> 00:11:58.514
statistic in my head--were
killed, off, I think it's fairly

00:11:58.514 --> 00:12:01.095
near Ireland.
And, of course,

00:12:01.095 --> 00:12:06.005
the Americans go wild and say
that this ship was carrying

00:12:06.005 --> 00:12:10.389
passengers going over to Britain
and civilians,

00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:12.998
and this was an act of piracy,
an act of war,

00:12:12.998 --> 00:12:15.429
an act of murder,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:12:15.429 --> 00:12:18.913
It turns out that I think it
was in the 1960s or 1970s,

00:12:18.913 --> 00:12:22.169
I vaguely remember this,
that they sent divers down into

00:12:22.169 --> 00:12:24.819
the Lusitania and they found
that, as the Germans had

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:26.856
claimed,
it was absolutely correct that

00:12:26.856 --> 00:12:29.563
the Americans were--this ship
was carrying munitions and

00:12:29.563 --> 00:12:32.320
therefore--I'm not defending the
sinking of the ship,

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.980
I'm not for the defending of
the sinking of any ship--but

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:41.250
clearly it was carrying weapons,
and that's one of the reasons

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.882
that the ship went down with
such a dramatic impact is

00:12:43.882 --> 00:12:46.862
because all the munitions blew
up when the German torpedo hit

00:12:46.862 --> 00:12:48.783
it.
But over the long run what

00:12:48.783 --> 00:12:52.239
happens is that the man who was
going to keep America out of

00:12:52.239 --> 00:12:53.731
war,
Woodrow Wilson,

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:57.985
former President of Princeton
University, ends up taking the

00:12:57.985 --> 00:12:59.789
U.S.
into war.

00:12:59.789 --> 00:13:02.362
And those of you who have had
American History from Glenda or

00:13:02.362 --> 00:13:04.164
other people,
Glenda Gilmore or other folks

00:13:04.164 --> 00:13:06.477
here,
will know that in the end most

00:13:06.477 --> 00:13:09.240
Americans really didn't want to
go to war.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.632
And Wilson, wbo was the first
American President,

00:13:12.632 --> 00:13:16.802
by the way, ever to leave the
United States during a term of

00:13:16.802 --> 00:13:18.920
office,
goes to Versailles,

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.813
to the Treaty of Versailles
after the war,

00:13:21.813 --> 00:13:25.835
and then he can't get the
treaty ever ratified by the U.S.

00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:29.785
Congress after that.
His repudiation is really

00:13:29.785 --> 00:13:34.679
complete, unfortunately for him,
at the end of the war.

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:38.373
Now, what difference did the
Americans coming into the war

00:13:38.373 --> 00:13:42.178
mean, in 1917?
It was not the troops--lots of

00:13:42.178 --> 00:13:45.778
troops begin to arrive,
led by Pershing,

00:13:45.778 --> 00:13:49.562
John Pershing,
who had honed his skills by

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:53.070
shooting down Mexicans in
Mexico.

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.705
And they have the reputation
for being sort of cowboys in

00:13:56.705 --> 00:13:59.886
earnest, and sort of the typical
American image is

00:13:59.886 --> 00:14:03.651
really--although that's been
devastated in the last four or

00:14:03.651 --> 00:14:06.832
five years--but really is
created by the Americans

00:14:06.832 --> 00:14:10.273
arriving to fight,
and they're well-trained,

00:14:10.273 --> 00:14:13.360
pistol-wielding sharpshooters
and all that.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.350
And they first go to- they
first fight at

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.740
Château-Thierry,
which is not very far from

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:19.929
Paris, it's northeast of Paris,
in 1917.

00:14:19.929 --> 00:14:21.460
But that's not what makes the
difference.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:25.786
American troops in the long run
will help tilt the scale to the

00:14:25.786 --> 00:14:30.113
Allies, and it compensates for
what we've discussed in terms of

00:14:30.113 --> 00:14:34.580
the French not having--they're
going to run out of soldiers.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:37.538
But the big difference is that
the curves cross,

00:14:37.538 --> 00:14:41.315
that the curves of the ability
of the Germans to supply their

00:14:41.315 --> 00:14:44.543
own forces;
that the German war machine is

00:14:44.543 --> 00:14:48.882
not going to be able to compete
with the combined power of

00:14:48.882 --> 00:14:52.411
American industrial might,
and Detroit can be easily

00:14:52.411 --> 00:14:55.159
converted--the factories in
Detroit, and Ypsilanti,

00:14:55.159 --> 00:14:58.062
and Flint, Michigan,
and lots of other places,

00:14:58.062 --> 00:15:01.868
can be easily transformed into
production of--Ypsilanti into

00:15:01.868 --> 00:15:05.300
the production of arms,
and places like that.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.061
And, so, the curves cross.
And it's at that point when

00:15:09.061 --> 00:15:13.149
many people in the French and
the British High Command,

00:15:13.149 --> 00:15:17.163
along with the Americans--they
know they're going to win the

00:15:17.163 --> 00:15:21.570
war in the long run,
but the question, at what cost?

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.994
And there's lively discussion,
as there had been in Germany,

00:15:24.994 --> 00:15:26.955
over German war aims.
The Germans,

00:15:26.955 --> 00:15:30.080
if they win the war in the west
they're going to want--demand

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.037
part of Belgium,
they're going to want probably

00:15:33.037 --> 00:15:35.659
more of Lorraine,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:39.250
The French also have their war
aims.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.049
They're going to want to have a
permanent French presence;

00:15:42.049 --> 00:15:45.525
they're talking about that in
the Rhineland as well as taking

00:15:45.525 --> 00:15:49.139
Alsace and Lorraine back.
And so that helps set up--which

00:15:49.139 --> 00:15:52.049
I'll come back to talk about in
awhile--1918,

00:15:52.049 --> 00:15:56.016
March, because that's when the
Germans say, "baby it's now or

00:15:56.016 --> 00:15:58.487
never."
And, so, that's the big

00:15:58.487 --> 00:16:01.770
Ludendorff offensive,
which I'll come back to,

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:05.319
in March of 1918.
That's important to say,

00:16:05.319 --> 00:16:08.279
to discuss at least a little
bit.

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:16.112
Now, what about the mutinies
and what about other aspects of

00:16:16.112 --> 00:16:21.234
the war?
They have to do with the home

00:16:21.234 --> 00:16:24.740
front.
And the mutinies are not on the

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:28.250
home front but they're quite
close to it.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:39.144
As I said at the beginning
here, most people in France did

00:16:39.144 --> 00:16:44.963
not want war in 1914,
but because it was easy to

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:47.809
portray Germany as the
aggressors, which they were,

00:16:47.809 --> 00:16:52.016
the vast majority of the
population obviously was

00:16:52.016 --> 00:16:57.450
prepared to hold on because of
the proximity certainly of Paris

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.805
to the front;
and this is right through the

00:17:00.805 --> 00:17:04.473
war, it's right through into the
failure of the Ludendorff

00:17:04.473 --> 00:17:06.876
offensive.
Now, to be sure there are

00:17:06.876 --> 00:17:09.759
tensions within French society
about the war.

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:13.227
There was tremendous
resentment, and you can see

00:17:13.227 --> 00:17:17.286
photos of this resentment,
as in Paris the opera was one

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:20.089
place where they distributed
coal,

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:24.029
that was rationed,
in order to have heat.

00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:26.644
And as you know from discussion
previously of the Grands

00:17:26.644 --> 00:17:29.401
Boulevards, that's where many of
the famous restaurants and

00:17:29.401 --> 00:17:31.165
cafés,
the Café

00:17:31.165 --> 00:17:34.413
American, the Café
de la Paix, ironically the

00:17:34.413 --> 00:17:37.015
Café de la Paix,
the café

00:17:37.015 --> 00:17:39.789
of peace, and all those things
are located.

00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:44.658
And, so, as people waited in
line to hope to get a few chunks

00:17:44.658 --> 00:17:49.769
of coal in order to stay warm in
these cold Parisian winters,

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:52.565
they saw the fancy people in
their big cars,

00:17:52.565 --> 00:17:55.359
driven by chauffeurs,
going off to the great

00:17:55.359 --> 00:17:57.981
restaurants,
and people who had profiteered

00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:00.488
from the war.
And name me a war in which

00:18:00.488 --> 00:18:04.771
people do not profit enormously
and in which some aspects of big

00:18:04.771 --> 00:18:08.579
business are not just gleeful
with every extended tour of

00:18:08.579 --> 00:18:11.157
duty,
and you'll have discovered

00:18:11.157 --> 00:18:13.930
something that I didn't know
existed.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:17.353
And, so, there's a lot of
tension toward profiteers,

00:18:17.353 --> 00:18:19.501
to les gros,
the big guys,

00:18:19.501 --> 00:18:21.984
the fat guys,
les gros bonnets,

00:18:21.984 --> 00:18:25.970
the big hats.
And you've got those tensions.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:28.804
But you have--more than that
you have tensions between those

00:18:28.804 --> 00:18:31.415
people who, peasants,
les paysans,

00:18:31.415 --> 00:18:35.218
who are conscripted without any
real possibility,

00:18:35.218 --> 00:18:39.180
unless they're already had two
brothers killed,

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:42.270
and that saves them;
and, for example,

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.519
skilled workers in the armament
industry.

00:18:44.519 --> 00:18:46.595
For example around
Saint-Étienne,

00:18:46.595 --> 00:18:49.468
Saint-Étienne is an
armament manufacturing town,

00:18:49.468 --> 00:18:51.970
or was--they used to make bikes
there, too.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.109
They don't make either there
anymore.

00:18:54.109 --> 00:18:56.447
Or in Tulles,
in the Corrèze,

00:18:56.447 --> 00:18:59.986
places that make arms,
people, skilled workers got out

00:18:59.986 --> 00:19:05.276
of the draft because of that.
And thus they worked very hard

00:19:05.276 --> 00:19:10.009
but there was some tension
towards that from,

00:19:10.009 --> 00:19:12.686
for example,
people in the Massif Central

00:19:12.686 --> 00:19:16.768
where you have the most endless
lists of names killed that one

00:19:16.768 --> 00:19:19.758
could ever see,
in Auvergne and places like

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:21.977
that.
So, you have those sorts of

00:19:21.977 --> 00:19:25.178
tensions, as well.
Now, the role of women in all

00:19:25.178 --> 00:19:28.930
this is of course crucial
because it's in the factories,

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.346
particularly in not highly
skilled work because they didn't

00:19:32.346 --> 00:19:35.410
have the formation or the
training in that,

00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:39.009
that women step up and replace
men.

00:19:39.009 --> 00:19:41.869
And also, again the role of
nurses is so important.

00:19:41.869 --> 00:19:44.186
And, so, that's why it was
inconceivable for many French

00:19:44.186 --> 00:19:46.544
women, after all of this,
not to get the vote after World

00:19:46.544 --> 00:19:49.159
War One;
whereas in Britain women get

00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:53.097
the vote after World War Two;
and in the United States Rosie

00:19:53.097 --> 00:19:55.837
the Riveter, working in a
factory in Detroit or in

00:19:55.837 --> 00:20:00.217
Pittsburgh,
became sort of an icon for sort

00:20:00.217 --> 00:20:06.019
of the crypto-feminist movement
in later decades.

00:20:06.019 --> 00:20:08.759
So, you have some tensions
there.

00:20:08.759 --> 00:20:11.439
You also had workers who would
come back--and of course after

00:20:11.439 --> 00:20:14.074
the war, if they were lucky
enough to survive--Bruno Cabanes

00:20:14.074 --> 00:20:16.039
will probably talk about this
next week,

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:18.539
after midterm--they get thrown
out;

00:20:18.539 --> 00:20:20.720
they're the last hired so
they're the first fired.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.331
And there's some tensions
between males and females over

00:20:23.331 --> 00:20:26.180
that, too, because the males had
been out in the trenches,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.900
and they want those jobs back,
and all of that.

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.922
But another thing that's rather
interesting is of course the

00:20:31.922 --> 00:20:34.507
role of women and the nurses;
and the big,

00:20:34.507 --> 00:20:39.494
the northern French nuns and
the Belgian nuns with those huge

00:20:39.494 --> 00:20:41.880
hats.
And it was easy to become

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.701
anti-clerical,
and we've talked about that

00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:46.842
before,
but one of the things that

00:20:46.842 --> 00:20:49.413
calms that situation is the role
of the clergy,

00:20:49.413 --> 00:20:51.759
and in particular of the female
clergy,

00:20:51.759 --> 00:20:54.855
in attending to these horrible,
horrible wounds,

00:20:54.855 --> 00:20:57.490
and in some cases going to the
fronts,

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.828
working with ambulances and
this sort of thing,

00:20:59.828 --> 00:21:02.369
as other women did who didn't
happen to be nuns.

00:21:02.369 --> 00:21:06.440
And for example the case of
Lyon has been documented;

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.775
and Lyon was the capital of
Radical party,

00:21:08.775 --> 00:21:11.775
with a big R;
socially conservative and

00:21:11.775 --> 00:21:15.723
moderate politically but based
upon, built upon

00:21:15.723 --> 00:21:19.194
anti-clericalism.
And in Lyon where there was

00:21:19.194 --> 00:21:21.599
this vibrant kind of
anti-clericalism,

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:25.042
before World War I,
that calms down because these

00:21:25.042 --> 00:21:28.790
nuns who people attacked,
representing in some ways the

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:32.537
institutionalized role of the
Catholic Church in French

00:21:32.537 --> 00:21:35.223
society,
were extraordinarily heroic,

00:21:35.223 --> 00:21:37.772
and so were these priests,
and ministers,

00:21:37.772 --> 00:21:40.634
and indeed rabbis,
who of course get killed by

00:21:40.634 --> 00:21:43.965
shells as they're giving the
last rights to all these people

00:21:43.965 --> 00:21:47.395
who have been killed.
And there's another tension too

00:21:47.395 --> 00:21:51.612
that's not talked about so much,
but I can--I've heard it in the

00:21:51.612 --> 00:21:54.960
sort of collective memory of
where we live too,

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.567
is that one of the things that
happens with the war--and

00:21:57.567 --> 00:21:59.796
obviously when you look at a map
of France--that

00:21:59.796 --> 00:22:02.119
départements like
the Ardennes,

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:04.001
and the Ain,
and the Marne,

00:22:04.001 --> 00:22:07.474
and the Pas-de-Calais,
and the Nord are basically

00:22:07.474 --> 00:22:09.651
German,
or the front line is running

00:22:09.651 --> 00:22:11.920
right through that
département.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.304
So, you've got these millions
of people who become refugees

00:22:15.304 --> 00:22:18.747
and they are going--in a more
organized fashion than in 1940

00:22:18.747 --> 00:22:21.956
when everybody's seen the
pictures of them walking along

00:22:21.956 --> 00:22:24.828
the roads,
carrying what they can,

00:22:24.828 --> 00:22:28.959
and then diving into the
ditches as the Luftwaffe,

00:22:28.959 --> 00:22:32.507
the German fighter plane,
the German air force is

00:22:32.507 --> 00:22:34.779
strafing them,
in a more organized fashion.

00:22:34.779 --> 00:22:36.681
But you still have to have
somewhere to go,

00:22:36.681 --> 00:22:39.397
you have to have someplace to
end up where you're going to be

00:22:39.397 --> 00:22:41.710
fed.
And, so, where do they end up?

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.836
Well, they end up in the places
in France where there is not

00:22:44.836 --> 00:22:47.838
fighting.
And it became that people get

00:22:47.838 --> 00:22:53.009
tired of the war by 1917--well,
everybody's tired of the war.

00:22:53.009 --> 00:22:56.660
But as one gets even tireder of
the war you hear this sort of

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.460
grumbling about these people
from the north,

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.781
and they speak a different
accent in some cases--if they

00:23:02.781 --> 00:23:05.619
speak German they speak a
different language;

00:23:05.619 --> 00:23:08.565
if they speak Flemish,
and there are lots of Flemish

00:23:08.565 --> 00:23:12.204
speakers who come down from the
Nord, from places like Hasbrouck

00:23:12.204 --> 00:23:15.562
and all of that.
And, so, they are strains on

00:23:15.562 --> 00:23:18.944
local resources,
which are already extremely

00:23:18.944 --> 00:23:22.125
limited.
And, so, you even have this

00:23:22.125 --> 00:23:25.555
talk, grumbling,
it's not more than that,

00:23:25.555 --> 00:23:30.700
but grumbling in cafés
and bars about Paris's war,

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:36.594
but also about les borschts
du nord, that is the Germans

00:23:36.594 --> 00:23:39.690
of the north.
And one of the things is that a

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.329
lot of people in the north of
France are blonde,

00:23:42.329 --> 00:23:44.723
and a lot of people,
the majority of the people in

00:23:44.723 --> 00:23:46.529
the south of France have dark
hair.

00:23:46.529 --> 00:23:49.007
And, so, all of a sudden
there's this arrival--it was a

00:23:49.007 --> 00:23:51.442
silly way of viewing it,
but this is how people viewed

00:23:51.442 --> 00:23:54.140
it, is that you had your blonde
people in the south and you have

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.490
dark people in the north,
that life is like that.

00:23:56.490 --> 00:23:58.287
But you have the arrival of
these people,

00:23:58.287 --> 00:24:00.039
many of whom look like they're
Dutch,

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:05.106
who're arriving and who cause
some sort of strain on the

00:24:05.106 --> 00:24:10.540
ability of communities to take
care of those perceived as of

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:15.405
their own.
And, so, 1917 is a big year for

00:24:15.405 --> 00:24:19.738
that as well.
You have other kinds of

00:24:19.738 --> 00:24:23.073
problems.
1917 is the year lots of men

00:24:23.073 --> 00:24:25.828
and women go on strike.
Now, they are not,

00:24:25.828 --> 00:24:28.099
these are not "defeatist",
in quotes, strikes,

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:30.269
but the strikes in
Saint-Étienne,

00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:34.267
and many of them are involving
women, are demands for better

00:24:34.267 --> 00:24:37.180
working conditions,
for better wages.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:39.269
They're part of the Sacred
Union, Union

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:41.205
Sacrée,
but they want better

00:24:41.205 --> 00:24:43.520
conditions.
And, so, the strikes in 1917,

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:46.515
again they're not defeatist
strikes, they want to win the

00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:48.935
war,
but it's the same thing as the

00:24:48.935 --> 00:24:52.140
movement before the war for
better conditions.

00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.604
Why should you work for worse
conditions than men,

00:24:54.604 --> 00:24:56.516
for example,
or why should you work for

00:24:56.516 --> 00:24:59.634
conditions when the profiteers
are getting rich and the gros

00:24:59.634 --> 00:25:01.248
bonnets,
the big bonnets,

00:25:01.248 --> 00:25:03.551
the big hats are getting
wealthy, why should you have

00:25:03.551 --> 00:25:06.682
terrible conditions?
And, so, these strikes are very

00:25:06.682 --> 00:25:10.309
widespread.
Clemenceau has more power;

00:25:10.309 --> 00:25:12.450
in 1917 he becomes prime
minister, he says,

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:14.234
"I wage war,
I wage war, I wage war,

00:25:14.234 --> 00:25:17.465
that's all."
There were attempts to break

00:25:17.465 --> 00:25:22.211
the strikes but it's a year
where the morale of the home

00:25:22.211 --> 00:25:26.532
front is extremely fragile.
It's more fragile in 1917 than

00:25:26.532 --> 00:25:29.452
in any other time.
And there seems to be this

00:25:29.452 --> 00:25:33.588
enormous disparity between the
sort of howling propaganda of

00:25:33.588 --> 00:25:36.584
big newspapers,
in which everything is a great

00:25:36.584 --> 00:25:39.012
victory and defeats are just
tiny setbacks,

00:25:39.012 --> 00:25:41.855
a step back;
and if things are so damn good

00:25:41.855 --> 00:25:44.619
why are the Germans still close
to Paris?

00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:47.240
And, so, it becomes pretty hard
to explain.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.342
Now, they don't have the
problems that the Germans will

00:25:49.342 --> 00:25:51.250
have because--and that's a
different situation.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:56.151
A very good book edited by my
friend Jay Winter and Jean-Louis

00:25:56.151 --> 00:26:01.053
Robert called Capital Cities
at War--because conditions

00:26:01.053 --> 00:26:04.829
are worse in Berlin than they
are in Paris.

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:08.539
But conditions are much better
in London than they are in

00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:11.454
Paris, and that's for fairly
obvious reasons,

00:26:11.454 --> 00:26:14.369
though the losses are still
equally bad.

00:26:14.369 --> 00:26:19.309
So, that year,
1917, is a bad year but overall

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:26.005
things are calmed down and for
these reasons I've already said

00:26:26.005 --> 00:26:31.897
it is a turning point.
Now, what about these,

00:26:31.897 --> 00:26:35.880
the mutinies?
How serious were the mutinies?

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.648
There were probably only two
divisions that were totally

00:26:39.648 --> 00:26:42.936
reliable, standing between the
Germans and Paris,

00:26:42.936 --> 00:26:45.532
at that point.
Not reliable again to the

00:26:45.532 --> 00:26:47.711
extent that they want the
Germans to win,

00:26:47.711 --> 00:26:49.569
because they don't,
but they want,

00:26:49.569 --> 00:26:51.406
for example,
the rights--the French were

00:26:51.406 --> 00:26:54.185
trying to keep representatives
from the Socialist Party from

00:26:54.185 --> 00:26:57.152
going to Switzerland or going to
Sweden to meet in international

00:26:57.152 --> 00:27:01.079
peace conferences,
and that sort of thing.

00:27:01.079 --> 00:27:03.312
I spoke earlier,
whenever it was,

00:27:03.312 --> 00:27:07.149
Monday, about this sort of
discontinuity or the contrast

00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:10.777
between the soldiers' view of
the war and that of the

00:27:10.777 --> 00:27:14.963
civilians--and one of the--and
how the soldiers back on leave

00:27:14.963 --> 00:27:18.940
didn't want to talk about it and
couldn't really give that

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:22.150
precise kinds of information
anyway,

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.689
because often it's all swirling
around them and they don't

00:27:24.689 --> 00:27:27.363
really know what's going on in
other places except where they

00:27:27.363 --> 00:27:29.678
are.
But one of the best evidences

00:27:29.678 --> 00:27:33.460
of that is the fact that nobody,
as far as we can tell,

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:38.178
at the home front really knew,
at the time of the mutinies,

00:27:38.178 --> 00:27:42.490
about how serious and
widespread the mutinies were,

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:47.455
that they didn't really know.
Now, remember also that--in

00:27:47.455 --> 00:27:51.347
fact, this is one of the key
sources for Bruno Cabanes'

00:27:51.347 --> 00:27:55.311
magnificent book on--the
translation to English would be

00:27:55.311 --> 00:27:59.420
something like Victory
Plunged into Mourning,

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.259
that is the return of the
soldiers.

00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:04.838
One of the principal sources
are letters written by soldiers

00:28:04.838 --> 00:28:07.810
from the front that were
collected and censored by

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:11.267
military censors who don't want
these letters revealing to

00:28:11.267 --> 00:28:14.240
civilians much of what was going
on at all.

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:18.378
And, so, that also explains why
people at the home front really

00:28:18.378 --> 00:28:22.049
didn't know about how widespread
these mutinies were,

00:28:22.049 --> 00:28:26.154
nor did the Germans,
nor did the British,

00:28:26.154 --> 00:28:31.285
outside of High Command,
have any sense of what was

00:28:31.285 --> 00:28:35.093
going on.
Now, these mutinies,

00:28:35.093 --> 00:28:42.266
it's not too hard to say why
these mutinies take place when

00:28:42.266 --> 00:28:47.460
they do, or why they take place
at all.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.711
It is not again defeatism,
they don't want the Germans to

00:28:50.711 --> 00:28:52.589
win.
They have some respect,

00:28:52.589 --> 00:28:56.248
lots of respect for the German
soldiers they're fighting

00:28:56.248 --> 00:28:58.704
against,
although at the end of the war

00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:02.154
they still just sort of--what
seeps out of these letters--and

00:29:02.154 --> 00:29:04.799
maybe Bruno will talk about this
next time,

00:29:04.799 --> 00:29:08.637
is hatred for the horrible Hun,
et cetera, et cetera,

00:29:08.637 --> 00:29:12.696
but that anybody could tell
that these tactics were just

00:29:12.696 --> 00:29:16.829
killing hundreds of thousands of
people for nothing,

00:29:16.829 --> 00:29:20.511
for nothing,
that there wasn't going to be a

00:29:20.511 --> 00:29:25.178
French-British breakthrough;
that the Battle of the Somme

00:29:25.178 --> 00:29:28.026
grounds to a halt,
all along the front,

00:29:28.026 --> 00:29:33.760
for obvious reasons,
after a matter of really days

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:39.569
but weeks, and that there isn't
any hope.

00:29:39.569 --> 00:29:43.337
It began when one company-- Oh,
by the way, how do we know

00:29:43.337 --> 00:29:45.322
this?
We don't know it from Kirk

00:29:45.322 --> 00:29:48.977
Douglas.
Most archives in France can be

00:29:48.977 --> 00:29:52.940
opened up fifty years after the
fact.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:58.109
So, what year is this?
2000 something or other, 2007.

00:29:58.109 --> 00:30:01.474
So, we can see the archives
fifty years ago,

00:30:01.474 --> 00:30:05.843
but not forty-nine years ago.
But with the military archives,

00:30:05.843 --> 00:30:08.538
because this was so sensitive,
the mutinies,

00:30:08.538 --> 00:30:12.549
all of these documents were in
the war archives in Vincennes.

00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:16.586
And I saw them before they were
open because I bribed my way in,

00:30:16.586 --> 00:30:19.260
not to see them,
I was working on something else

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.909
but the person that ran this,
the war archives was just

00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:23.813
totally clueless,
totally clueless,

00:30:23.813 --> 00:30:27.071
and she'd leave for about three
hour trysts or lunch breaks I

00:30:27.071 --> 00:30:28.869
guess,
more appropriately.

00:30:28.869 --> 00:30:32.151
And I knew these documents were
there and so I knew also,

00:30:32.151 --> 00:30:36.019
somebody had tipped me off that
the gardien likes stamps,

00:30:36.019 --> 00:30:38.881
and so I would put all these
wild sort of stamps on my mail,

00:30:38.881 --> 00:30:40.869
letters, when people still used
stamps;

00:30:40.869 --> 00:30:44.869
I had ones from Latin America
and ones from Africa.

00:30:44.869 --> 00:30:47.939
And this guy comes up and he
says, "oh, very beautiful these

00:30:47.939 --> 00:30:49.016
stamps."
I said, "oh,

00:30:49.016 --> 00:30:53.870
do you like stamps?"
And he'd be, "yes, yes."

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.619
"Well would you like these?"
"Oh, thank you so much."

00:30:56.619 --> 00:30:59.750
And pretty soon I'm in the
archives, in the back.

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:04.098
And he's an officer too,
he's some sort of lieutenant

00:31:04.098 --> 00:31:08.051
guy--he's a real good guy.
Anyway, so I bribed my way in,

00:31:08.051 --> 00:31:10.307
and you could see these,
all these cartons,

00:31:10.307 --> 00:31:13.375
and they were chained,
they were literally all chained

00:31:13.375 --> 00:31:16.404
in this big kind of capsule;
it looked like a space capsule

00:31:16.404 --> 00:31:19.375
except it was just-- looks like
the basement of Branford College

00:31:19.375 --> 00:31:22.607
or something.
But you couldn't get into those

00:31:22.607 --> 00:31:27.562
because that was thought to be
the national disgrace that there

00:31:27.562 --> 00:31:32.198
had been these mutinies.
And the mutinies were indeed

00:31:32.198 --> 00:31:36.349
widespread.
And so what happens is that

00:31:36.349 --> 00:31:41.270
refusals to go over the top
simply spread.

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:44.500
They spread like wildfire.
Soldiers say they don't want to

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.220
get killed anymore for five
cents a day.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:49.946
In some places red flags go up
and in some places there are

00:31:49.946 --> 00:31:53.029
black flags, which are the flags
of anarchism.

00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:57.554
But remember that the
socialists had also joined the

00:31:57.554 --> 00:32:02.788
Sacred Union and that Jules
Guesde ends up being Minister of

00:32:02.788 --> 00:32:07.430
Transport,
or Minister of Communication,

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:12.705
or something like that,
in 1915, if I remember

00:32:12.705 --> 00:32:15.730
correctly.
And two regiments that are

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:19.309
posted in Soissons--Soissons is
not very far away from Paris,

00:32:19.309 --> 00:32:23.202
Soissons is about a forty-five
minute drive away from Paris,

00:32:23.202 --> 00:32:25.722
by car now.
Two regiments decide they're

00:32:25.722 --> 00:32:28.809
going to march on Paris to try
to set things right.

00:32:28.809 --> 00:32:32.356
They're going to force the
Chamber of Deputies to find a

00:32:32.356 --> 00:32:35.707
way to end the war;
not to say we want the Germans

00:32:35.707 --> 00:32:39.170
to win but to find a way,
get some sort of negotiated

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:42.099
settlement, so that this carnage
stopped.

00:32:42.099 --> 00:32:45.604
Most of the generals,
who are fairly clueless,

00:32:45.604 --> 00:32:49.420
see organized Bolshevik
propaganda behind this;

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.752
or pacifists,
those people coming out of

00:32:52.752 --> 00:32:58.221
Sweden or Switzerland and trying
to stop the useless way this war

00:32:58.221 --> 00:33:03.976
is being fought.
In May and June about 40,000

00:33:03.976 --> 00:33:11.779
soldiers were involved in
collective acts of refusal,

00:33:11.779 --> 00:33:16.226
and although the generals
insisted in their correspondence

00:33:16.226 --> 00:33:20.905
that those 40,000 people were
cowards--this obviously was not

00:33:20.905 --> 00:33:23.366
the case,
and many of them had already

00:33:23.366 --> 00:33:25.328
been shot up,
and already been wounded,

00:33:25.328 --> 00:33:28.606
and already were going back.
And the first signs of this,

00:33:28.606 --> 00:33:32.198
by the way, are that soldiers
who were supposed to move up in

00:33:32.198 --> 00:33:35.970
order to prepare to go over the
top begin baaing like sheep,

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:38.287
going baa, baa,
the way that sheep baah on the

00:33:38.287 --> 00:33:40.450
way to the slaughter,
l'abattoir,

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:43.561
the slaughterhouse,
because that's where they were

00:33:43.561 --> 00:33:46.348
going.
Now, there was socialist and

00:33:46.348 --> 00:33:49.929
pacifist literature that had,
happily enough,

00:33:49.929 --> 00:33:53.510
in my view, had gotten into the
trenches.

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:56.676
But this is not the motivation.
And Pétain,

00:33:56.676 --> 00:33:59.694
who ends up being one of the
sort of evil forces in

00:33:59.694 --> 00:34:02.349
France--but this was early
Pétain,

00:34:02.349 --> 00:34:06.363
when Pétain,
he realizes that this is not

00:34:06.363 --> 00:34:11.144
the case, that in fact the
repression is much less severe

00:34:11.144 --> 00:34:15.670
than many of the generals
wanted--more about that in a

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:20.108
minute.
And, so, he ends the policy,

00:34:20.108 --> 00:34:25.099
Pétain does,
of these mad attacks;

00:34:25.099 --> 00:34:28.014
over the top,
the whistles blow,

00:34:28.014 --> 00:34:31.679
and then they simply get
slaughtered.

00:34:31.679 --> 00:34:34.626
In some areas--and we don't
have exact statistics because

00:34:34.626 --> 00:34:37.993
there were certainly some people
who were just put up against the

00:34:37.993 --> 00:34:40.630
wall and shot,
we don't know.

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:43.358
It's just like after 1945,
we don't know,

00:34:43.358 --> 00:34:46.769
we have a guess of 10,000
people were killed in the

00:34:46.769 --> 00:34:50.590
reprisals in 1945 but that's a
pretty rough account.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.769
But there were 34,027
condemnations,

00:34:53.769 --> 00:34:59.492
about ten percent of the people
who were--who faced some kind of

00:34:59.492 --> 00:35:05.760
court-martial for something they
did or something they didn't do.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:11.320
And forty-nine were condemned
to death, which is not--I'm not

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:16.694
for condemning anybody to death
but it--and then these were

00:35:16.694 --> 00:35:22.469
carried out as in the movie,
as in the film, immediately.

00:35:22.469 --> 00:35:25.530
It's just up against the wall,
bang, bang.

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:32.010
And Pétain tries to,
he tries to bring in better

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:35.427
conditions.
He ups the booze ration as

00:35:35.427 --> 00:35:38.500
well, and of course that was
pretty happy.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:44.270
So, and in fact I said 40,000,
but there's another statistic

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:47.889
that goes as high as 70,000
people.

00:35:47.889 --> 00:35:52.738
And let me throw in a statistic
as long as we're doing that for

00:35:52.738 --> 00:35:56.501
strikes.
In 1917 there were 689 strikes

00:35:56.501 --> 00:36:00.675
affecting 300,000
workers--that's a lot,

00:36:00.675 --> 00:36:04.671
trois cent mille,
300,000 workers,

00:36:04.671 --> 00:36:10.010
and that's compared to
ninety-eight strikes in 1916.

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:14.395
But, again, a fascinating
aspect I'm repeating is that

00:36:14.395 --> 00:36:18.285
this was not known,
and this was not known--then

00:36:18.285 --> 00:36:22.919
you couldn't drive it in
forty-five minutes--but this was

00:36:22.919 --> 00:36:27.140
not known in Paris by the
general population,

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:35.119
what had happened.
And in the end France holds on.

00:36:35.119 --> 00:36:41.676
Now, in the spring of 1918 the
Germans launch their "victory

00:36:41.676 --> 00:36:46.121
drive," in quotes,
the first major German

00:36:46.121 --> 00:36:50.634
offensive since 1914;
before it's been the British

00:36:50.634 --> 00:36:53.360
and the French attempting to
break through.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.719
Now, at the same time the
Austro-Hungarian Empire--the

00:36:56.719 --> 00:37:00.015
army is--all the cracks that
were quite predicted and

00:37:00.015 --> 00:37:02.971
predictable,
there are all sorts of problems

00:37:02.971 --> 00:37:05.478
there.
And Franz Joseph has died in

00:37:05.478 --> 00:37:09.319
1916, and so the Germans are
quite unsure whether the

00:37:09.319 --> 00:37:13.899
Austro-Hungarian Empire is going
to be able to hold on fighting

00:37:13.899 --> 00:37:16.829
against the Italians,
for example;

00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:23.096
and remember that Brest-Litovsk
is not signed until March of

00:37:23.096 --> 00:37:25.629
1918.
And the Americans have,

00:37:25.629 --> 00:37:28.429
by spring of 1918,325,000
soldiers.

00:37:28.429 --> 00:37:31.826
That's not a huge number of
soldiers but that's still three

00:37:31.826 --> 00:37:34.110
times Michigan Football Stadium
full.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:37.404
So, that's a lot of people.
So, Ludendorff decides on a

00:37:37.404 --> 00:37:41.079
massive German assault along the
poor old Somme River,

00:37:41.079 --> 00:37:46.103
therefore avoiding the mud of
Flanders and avoiding the forts

00:37:46.103 --> 00:37:51.154
of eastern France around Verdun.
He was encouraged by the fact

00:37:51.154 --> 00:37:55.716
that there are younger soldiers
that are just barely eighteen

00:37:55.716 --> 00:37:58.530
that have been put into the
ranks,

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:01.920
and he also has brought up much
older men too.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:05.349
So, they have some serious
troops in order to try to pull

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:08.906
off this breakthrough.
And, so, on the 21st of March,

00:38:08.906 --> 00:38:12.940
1918, after a relatively brief
bombardment of five hours,

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:18.206
as opposed to five days,
1.6 million men--who could have

00:38:18.206 --> 00:38:23.757
imagined these numbers,
who could have imagined these

00:38:23.757 --> 00:38:30.182
numbers in 1913?--1.6 million
men attack the Allied defenses

00:38:30.182 --> 00:38:36.390
in five separate offences over a
front of forty miles.

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:41.892
And they do break through.
In five days some German units

00:38:41.892 --> 00:38:47.426
have pushed forward more than
forty miles, and there was--a

00:38:47.426 --> 00:38:52.960
complementary attack in Flanders
does very well indeed.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:57.914
And the British troops and the
French, as General Haigh in

00:38:57.914 --> 00:39:02.869
Britain famously once said,
were fighting with their backs

00:39:02.869 --> 00:39:06.146
to the wall.
And on Easter Sunday of that

00:39:06.146 --> 00:39:10.256
year, again the shells from Big
Bertha lobbed all those miles,

00:39:10.256 --> 00:39:12.480
from the north,
fall on Paris.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.497
The Rue de Rivoli,
you can still see a sign where

00:39:14.497 --> 00:39:16.010
it took out an apartment
building.

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:20.360
Church of Saint-Gervais,
right near the Seine.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.377
Boulevard Port-Royal,
up by Montparnasse,

00:39:23.377 --> 00:39:27.557
the same thing.
So, these shells fall and they

00:39:27.557 --> 00:39:31.215
begin taking lives.
But what happens was

00:39:31.215 --> 00:39:36.219
predictable and predicted,
is that as on the small scale,

00:39:36.219 --> 00:39:41.090
in the big scale the Germans
begin to outrun their cover and

00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:45.960
supplies, and they begin at each
one of these five points of

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:50.170
German offensive to encounter
stiff resistance.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:58.252
On July 15th Ludendorff tries a
last desperate attack and it's

00:39:58.252 --> 00:40:00.849
repulsed.
And for Ludendorff,

00:40:00.849 --> 00:40:03.670
he knew this was the last
chance to win the war,

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.389
and at that point he knows it's
la fin des haricots,

00:40:07.389 --> 00:40:11.290
the end of the green beans,
that they're simply not going

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:15.586
to win and that the French,
their resources swollen by the

00:40:15.586 --> 00:40:19.988
American entrance into the war,
are not going to sue for an

00:40:19.988 --> 00:40:24.769
armistice until they push the
Germans back across the Rhine.

00:40:24.769 --> 00:40:29.579
And at that point morale
plunges dangerously in Germany.

00:40:29.579 --> 00:40:33.899
In January of 1918,250,000
German workers defy the

00:40:33.899 --> 00:40:38.312
government by going on strike;
and strikes were illegal during

00:40:38.312 --> 00:40:41.445
the war, there was all sorts of
hoarding, and so there's a big

00:40:41.445 --> 00:40:43.231
problem.
And the Allies,

00:40:43.231 --> 00:40:46.652
the British,
the French, and the Americans,

00:40:46.652 --> 00:40:49.681
counter-attack in July.
And at this point,

00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:51.859
when they're in the open for
the first time,

00:40:51.859 --> 00:40:54.644
tanks that you've all seen
pictures of them stuck in the

00:40:54.644 --> 00:40:56.518
mud,
now when they're in the open

00:40:56.518 --> 00:40:59.508
tanks begin to work rather well,
and they begin to adopt the

00:40:59.508 --> 00:41:03.255
strategy of having soldiers,
infantry following tanks and

00:41:03.255 --> 00:41:07.530
therefore not getting picked off
in such huge numbers,

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:11.849
and they begin to make a big
difference.

00:41:11.849 --> 00:41:16.516
On the 8th of August,
1918, the German army's darkest

00:41:16.516 --> 00:41:21.810
day, there are all sorts of
attacks against the German lines

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:25.579
and a British force moves eight
miles;

00:41:25.579 --> 00:41:31.369
and that's a territory that was
unimaginable in the beginning.

00:41:31.369 --> 00:41:36.209
At this point Ludendorff tells
the hapless Wilhelm II that it's

00:41:36.209 --> 00:41:40.813
all over but the shouting and
you better figure out some way

00:41:40.813 --> 00:41:44.170
of bringing this whole thing to
an end.

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:47.418
And, as you know,
in the end Wilhelm II will

00:41:47.418 --> 00:41:52.177
slither across the Dutch border
and the Armistice will be signed

00:41:52.177 --> 00:41:55.225
in a railroad car,
in Compiègne,

00:41:55.225 --> 00:41:58.688
north of Paris--there's still a
railroad car there,

00:41:58.688 --> 00:42:01.917
it's not the same one,
and that's where Hitler

00:42:01.917 --> 00:42:05.628
insisted on the declaration of
the Armistice in 1940 being

00:42:05.628 --> 00:42:08.688
signed--so the war ends on the
11th of November,

00:42:08.688 --> 00:42:10.191
1918.
And, as you know,

00:42:10.191 --> 00:42:12.946
there were many people--not
many, but there were lots of

00:42:12.946 --> 00:42:15.802
people killed afterwards because
they didn't know that the

00:42:15.802 --> 00:42:18.707
Armistice had come along and
that the biggest pandemic ever

00:42:18.707 --> 00:42:22.000
in human history,
at least since the Black Death

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.926
in the fourteenth century,
the Spanish flu,

00:42:24.926 --> 00:42:28.552
as it was called;
it probably started in India

00:42:28.552 --> 00:42:32.539
but had already begun to sweep
through the world.

00:42:32.539 --> 00:42:36.731
So, things were not getting
better and better but they were

00:42:36.731 --> 00:42:40.849
getting worse and worse.
Just a few obvious

00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:48.440
statistics--you can see these
all over but it is staggering;

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.524
before I end with something
that Jay Winter has begun one of

00:42:53.524 --> 00:42:56.313
his books with.
Just in terms of dead and

00:42:56.313 --> 00:42:58.856
wounded, just a couple--you can
write these down,

00:42:58.856 --> 00:43:01.610
you can write them down or
don't write them down.

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:05.522
But, anyway,
Russia, dead,

00:43:05.522 --> 00:43:09.657
1,800,000;
wounded 5,000,000--now,

00:43:09.657 --> 00:43:15.545
that ain't nothing like World
War Two, 25,000,000 dead in the

00:43:15.545 --> 00:43:21.040
Soviet Union in World War
II--but 1.8 million is a rather

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:25.533
lot to be killed.
In France, the French at

00:43:25.533 --> 00:43:31.367
least--and probably more than
this--but you hear figures from

00:43:31.367 --> 00:43:38.869
1.4 million to 1.5 million dead;
and wounded 4,266,000.

00:43:38.869 --> 00:43:41.738
Great Britain,
including the empire,

00:43:41.738 --> 00:43:44.115
the dominion,
the Australians,

00:43:44.115 --> 00:43:47.148
the Kenyans,
dead, 908,000 and wounded

00:43:47.148 --> 00:43:50.304
2,000,000.
The Italians,

00:43:50.304 --> 00:43:55.840
578,000, with about a million
wounded.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:59.565
And Serbia, which is a very
small country,

00:43:59.565 --> 00:44:03.720
dead, 278,000;
wounded 133,000.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:09.610
Tiny Belgium, killed, 38,000;
wounded 44,000.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:14.161
And among the Central powers
Germany, 2,000,000 dead,

00:44:14.161 --> 00:44:17.356
2,000,000 dead;
after all that with your

00:44:17.356 --> 00:44:21.480
armies, how do you explain to
the folks back home all those

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:24.039
people dead, why you
surrendered?

00:44:24.039 --> 00:44:26.914
Well, it must be someone's
fault, and that's what the Right

00:44:26.914 --> 00:44:29.491
would argue--"it was the Jews,
it was the Socialists,

00:44:29.491 --> 00:44:32.007
it was the Communists;
there had to have been a stab

00:44:32.007 --> 00:44:33.627
in the back."
How do you explain this to the

00:44:33.627 --> 00:44:36.588
folks back home?
Wounded, 4,000,000--more than

00:44:36.588 --> 00:44:38.367
that.
Austria-Hungary,

00:44:38.367 --> 00:44:42.791
the amazing thing is they held
on so long, given all the

00:44:42.791 --> 00:44:46.814
national differences--1.1
million, with wounded 3.6

00:44:46.814 --> 00:44:49.782
million.
These are just statistics that

00:44:49.782 --> 00:44:53.331
are so incredible.
In France there are 36,000

00:44:53.331 --> 00:44:58.713
communes and there were only
twelve that didn't have somebody

00:44:58.713 --> 00:45:01.526
killed.
And that's why when you go to

00:45:01.526 --> 00:45:04.102
any French commune,
except those twelve,

00:45:04.102 --> 00:45:07.010
you'll see a list of those
people killed;

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:09.282
or even inside churches
sometimes they'll have the

00:45:09.282 --> 00:45:11.555
parish ones, and if the war
monuments are near the

00:45:11.555 --> 00:45:14.292
churches--that tends to happen
more in areas that were still

00:45:14.292 --> 00:45:16.642
Christianized,
where people still went to

00:45:16.642 --> 00:45:18.238
church;
and I mentioned this once

00:45:18.238 --> 00:45:20.878
before, but if you go to the
Bourbonnais or the Allier you

00:45:20.878 --> 00:45:23.889
still find these war memorials
that are sort of like Voltaire,

00:45:23.889 --> 00:45:26.591
"if God exists,
how could he or she let this

00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:28.778
happen?"
With broken crosses,

00:45:28.778 --> 00:45:32.054
shattered crosses;
they were lamenting that this

00:45:32.054 --> 00:45:34.840
could happen in a so-called
civilized world.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.127
And, of course,
one thing that happens after

00:45:37.127 --> 00:45:39.679
the war, as Charles pointed out
the other day,

00:45:39.679 --> 00:45:43.117
is that if you've been told--if
you're an African or you're an

00:45:43.117 --> 00:45:46.780
Asian and you've been told that
this is the great civilization,

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.530
that the Europeans,
they've got it all;

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:50.969
you've been told by them that
they're better than you.

00:45:50.969 --> 00:45:54.963
How do you reconcile that to
what they're screaming at you in

00:45:54.963 --> 00:45:58.024
their little schools,
trying to teach you their

00:45:58.024 --> 00:46:01.802
language?
If they're so damn better how

00:46:01.802 --> 00:46:06.019
could they bring all of this
upon Europe?

00:46:06.019 --> 00:46:10.540
There is, by the way,
but one soldier left in Great

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:14.789
Britain who's still alive from
World War One.

00:46:14.789 --> 00:46:17.190
He's a fellow called Harry
Payne.

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.356
He was born in 1898 and
somebody just published a book

00:46:21.356 --> 00:46:23.209
about him.
And periodically,

00:46:23.209 --> 00:46:25.190
on Armistice Day,
he is interviewed;

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:29.208
you can hear him on BBC.
But with the passing of time of

00:46:29.208 --> 00:46:31.530
course you don't have that
anymore.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:34.376
And I can remember even in my
jeunesse,

00:46:34.376 --> 00:46:37.981
I can remember seeing these
very aged people coming out on

00:46:37.981 --> 00:46:42.406
November 11th,
so proud of what they did,

00:46:42.406 --> 00:46:46.769
fighting.
And the Americans too that did.

00:46:46.769 --> 00:46:49.485
But in those days--those were
different wars and those were

00:46:49.485 --> 00:46:51.872
different countries,
and I would argue also that was

00:46:51.872 --> 00:46:55.357
a very different America.
Anyway, just to simply end with

00:46:55.357 --> 00:46:58.239
something that Jay Winter leaves
us with.

00:46:58.239 --> 00:47:03.550
He has a wonderful book about
mourning and memory.

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:08.299
And he begins with a film,
he begins with a film by Abel

00:47:08.299 --> 00:47:10.666
Gance.
Abel Gance, g-a-n-c-e,

00:47:10.666 --> 00:47:14.019
did a very long,
over-rated film on Napoleon,

00:47:14.019 --> 00:47:18.606
with the famous snowball fight.
But he did a book--he takes

00:47:18.606 --> 00:47:21.416
Zola's title,
but he did a movie called

00:47:21.416 --> 00:47:25.039
J'accuse! He makes it in
1918 and 1919;

00:47:25.039 --> 00:47:28.929
he made it before the war is
over.

00:47:28.929 --> 00:47:31.630
The hero is a guy called Jean
Diaz.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.705
He's a wounded soldier poet and
he goes crazy,

00:47:34.705 --> 00:47:38.260
he begins to lose his mind,
as so many people did,

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.587
after all that in World War
One, and he escapes from a

00:47:41.587 --> 00:47:44.036
mental hospital,
and he goes back to his

00:47:44.036 --> 00:47:47.315
village,
and he brings all the villagers

00:47:47.315 --> 00:47:51.959
together, and he tells them
about a dream that he's had in

00:47:51.959 --> 00:47:54.507
the asylum.
And in the dream,

00:47:54.507 --> 00:47:58.152
in the movie,
you see a battlefield graveyard

00:47:58.152 --> 00:48:01.278
with all the crosses,
they're all there,

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:04.566
and they're all askew,
and a big black cloud comes up

00:48:04.566 --> 00:48:07.721
behind the village graveyard,
in the movie,

00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:12.856
and magically these ghost-like
figures emerge from the grave

00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:17.570
with tattered bandages,
missing arms--their bandages

00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:20.719
begin to unravel around their
head.

00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:23.690
And some are blind,
they've lost their sight,

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:27.739
and some are coughing out their
lungs from the poison gas.

00:48:27.739 --> 00:48:31.471
And they leave the battlefield
and they go back to their own

00:48:31.471 --> 00:48:34.949
villages to see if the
sacrifices have been worth it.

00:48:34.949 --> 00:48:40.417
And what they find is what Jay
calls the pettiness of civilian

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:44.539
life, the black-marketing,
the profiteering.

00:48:44.539 --> 00:48:46.510
Their wives have been sleeping
around.

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:50.007
Things aren't the way they
should be, whereas they have

00:48:50.007 --> 00:48:52.017
suffered.
But they come back,

00:48:52.017 --> 00:48:55.090
they're alive again but they're
really dead.

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:59.587
And their appearance so
terrifies the villagers that

00:48:59.587 --> 00:49:04.702
they decide to mend their ways
and to become better people,

00:49:04.702 --> 00:49:08.637
better people.
And so these ghost-like figures

00:49:08.637 --> 00:49:12.423
and their bandages,
they march back to the cemetery

00:49:12.423 --> 00:49:16.739
and they go back into their
graves, and it's all over.

00:49:16.739 --> 00:49:21.403
But what's really interesting
about it is that some of the

00:49:21.403 --> 00:49:24.840
soldiers who were on leave at
that time,

00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.944
en permission,
were used as extras in the

00:49:27.944 --> 00:49:31.709
movie, and you can identify
them--someone who has lost his

00:49:31.709 --> 00:49:34.199
arm really,
it's not a fake missing arm,

00:49:34.199 --> 00:49:37.338
it's a real one.
And some of them who were

00:49:37.338 --> 00:49:41.438
there, in the movie,
go back to the war and are

00:49:41.438 --> 00:49:45.449
killed, they die real deaths,
in their graves,

00:49:45.449 --> 00:49:51.249
with their tattered bandages.
And it's as if art and reality

00:49:51.249 --> 00:49:53.800
have merged.
And that's an important theme

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.780
in all of this because there's
no war, no more powerful moment,

00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:01.451
in history, that has brought us
such great literature and all of

00:50:01.451 --> 00:50:03.894
this.
And there's no war like this

00:50:03.894 --> 00:50:07.400
ever that unleashed so many
demons into the world,

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:11.604
and it's some of those demons
that we will now next turn but

00:50:11.604 --> 00:50:13.768
not today.
Good luck on the midterm,

00:50:13.768 --> 00:50:16.000
have a great weekend.
Rock and roll.

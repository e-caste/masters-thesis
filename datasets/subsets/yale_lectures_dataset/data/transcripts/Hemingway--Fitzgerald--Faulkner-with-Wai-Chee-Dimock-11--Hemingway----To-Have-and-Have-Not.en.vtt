WAI CHEE DIMOCK: So let's
start by talking a

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:19.100
little bit about the film, those
of you who were there.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.700
We realize that the film
was very, very

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.067
different from the book.

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:33.000
But it's great screenwriting
on the part of Faulkner, in

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.667
fact, as there are really many
clever transformations as

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.267
Leslie pointed out.

00:00:39.267 --> 00:00:45.700
The lawyer, Bee-lips, in the
novel becomes the occasion for

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.900
a little joke about a dead bee,
and how a dead bee can

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.067
really sting you, really can
be a really powerful sting.

00:00:55.067 --> 00:01:00.067
That joke then was repeated
throughout the movie.

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:03.633
So it's a very clever
transformation.

00:01:03.633 --> 00:01:08.167
I would urge you to see the
movie on your own just to see

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:13.100
what kind of a screenwriter
Faulkner is.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.033
It's actually very impressive
to know that he could write

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:22.233
something like The Sound of
Fury, but he could also write

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:24.767
the screenplay for To
Have and Have Not.

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:28.533
So it's almost two sides of the

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:32.100
spectrum in terms of writing.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:40.167
So this is just to alert you to
the existence of the film.

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:46.033
But I also wanted to use this as
an occasion to talk about a

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:52.900
remark that Howard Hawks
made about the book, To

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.400
Have and Have Not.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.533
in many ways adding
insult to injury.

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:00.900
There he was completely changing
the plot line of the

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.667
novel, but he also had some
ungenerous things to say about

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:11.133
the novel and about Hemingway.

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:13.533
Because he was working with
Hemingway, and Hemingway

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:16.767
really was on record as being
quite unhappy with the way

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:19.467
that his novel was
transformed.

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:23.200
So Howard Hawks claimed to have
heard from Hemingway that

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.367
To Have and Have Not was a bunch
of junk, and apparently

00:02:27.367 --> 00:02:30.033
that was the excuse
for his completely

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:33.800
changing the novel around.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.667
It started out being really
good for nothing, no good.

00:02:36.667 --> 00:02:41.800
Then he suddenly should have the
freedom to change it as he

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.267
saw fit, which he did to
a staggering degree.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:53.767
But Howard Hawks really began
a tradition of people saying

00:02:53.767 --> 00:02:59.000
negative things about To Have
and Have Not, and we can look

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.933
at a few other instances of
people expressing a lot of

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.467
doubts about the novel.

00:03:05.467 --> 00:03:09.833
This is one of the most extreme
Delmore Schwartz.

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:15.100
"To Have and Have Not is a
stupid and foolish book, a

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.400
disgrace to a good writer, a
book which should never have

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.200
been printed.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.367
It contains passages of golden
writing, and the parts of

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.667
three good short stories --

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:33.367
when one of these parts appeared
in Esquire as a short

00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:38.433
story, it was much better there,
and not broken up by

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:44.900
the interposition of a chapter."
So about as hostile

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.467
a review as one could get.

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:50.667
Although, I should also say that
book reviews are a genre

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:55.200
in themselves, and quite often
book reviewers feel the need

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.100
to be critical.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:02.600
So it is completely within the
convention of book reviewing.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:11.100
Here's another, to my mind, much
more perceptive and much

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.833
truer to the spirit of To Have
and Have Not from a great

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:19.300
critic, Alfred Kazin.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.067
"A new Hemingway?

00:04:21.067 --> 00:04:22.833
Not altogether.

00:04:22.833 --> 00:04:28.200
There are passages and passages
in which the old icy

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.267
brilliance comes through with
the slippery rhythm, the

00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:36.833
virtual assonance, the artful
grade of phrases fused with

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:41.367
such laborious cleverness that
the click-clack of the beat is

00:04:41.367 --> 00:04:42.933
like a hiss...

00:04:42.933 --> 00:04:46.533
(but also) an unusual
awkwardness, for this is a

00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:51.233
Hemingway who is rather less
sure of himself than usual,

00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:54.300
but a good deal more intense."

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.100
So this, to my mind, catches
very well both what is good

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.200
about the novel, and
what makes it worth

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.600
reading in my mind.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.733
But also, obviously, it points
to some very clear defects

00:05:09.733 --> 00:05:10.767
about the novel.

00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:14.100
It's also a very good
characterization of Hemingway

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.733
in terms of the old icy
brilliance and the assonance

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:23.433
in Hemingway's prose that makes
it almost like poetry at

00:05:23.433 --> 00:05:24.367
many moments.

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:28.067
So it's just a very good overall
account of Hemingway.

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:34.967
But also a special take and
very, I think very true to the

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:38.233
spirit of Hemingway in thinking
that it's both less

00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:43.667
well-crafted, but maybe closer
to Hemingway's heart.

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:48.600
One more quote from another
critic, and very

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.767
understandable given the subject
matter of To Have and

00:05:53.767 --> 00:05:56.500
Have Not, saying that Hemingway
was "one of the

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.633
least overtly political writers
of his generation." I

00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:02.633
think it's a very interesting
statement.

00:06:02.633 --> 00:06:05.567
He was one of the least
overtly political.

00:06:05.567 --> 00:06:08.233
Does that mean that even
though he's not overtly

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:12.033
political, that actually there's
a kind of a deep

00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:15.767
politics in the novel?

00:06:15.767 --> 00:06:19.600
Not overt, but something that
once we look deeper, further,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.533
into the novel, we'll get
to see that there's

00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:23.433
some politics there.

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:28.600
So I would like to take that
as a starting point to as

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.000
whether or not To Have and Have
Not is a political novel.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.267
And as is the custom in this
class, I would like to think

00:06:37.267 --> 00:06:41.500
about it on two different
scales.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.333
One is through the macro
history, that is the

00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:50.567
background to the novel, and
we know that because Harry

00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:53.967
Morgan had so much to do with
Cubans who are trying to get

00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:56.700
to the United States in part
one, and then the Cubans

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.600
wanted to get back to Havana
in part three --

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.267
we know that the Cuban politics
is very much there.

00:07:05.267 --> 00:07:08.300
Along with that and parallel
of that, there is also the

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.800
Great Depression in
the United States.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.467
So this is very much a
novel of the 1930s.

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:18.033
These are the macro politics
that make up the

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:21.633
context of the novel.

00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:25.033
Moving to a somewhat different
scale on the scale of

00:07:25.033 --> 00:07:27.967
character, the trail
of character

00:07:27.967 --> 00:07:30.067
and narrative technique.

00:07:30.067 --> 00:07:32.767
I like to think about the
novel has different

00:07:32.767 --> 00:07:36.900
permutations of "have" and 'have
not,' so in that sense

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:40.000
its really themes
and variations

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
on the title itself.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.100
I'll be talking about Harry as
a Have Not in several ways,

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:52.700
linking back to the macro
history of the novel.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.067
But then what I really would
like to make the case for in

00:07:57.067 --> 00:08:01.633
the rest of the lecture is Harry
as a special kind of

00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:06.367
"have," what I would call a
mediated kind of "have." That

00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:07.767
is, he becomes --

00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:11.033
even though he so obviously
a "have not" --

00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:17.100
he becomes a "have" through the
presence of somebody else.

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.033
So this is what I mean by
mediated "have," through the

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:26.467
presence of another person,
either it could be Marie or it

00:08:26.467 --> 00:08:33.467
could be somebody like Richard
Gordon, Harry gets to become a

00:08:33.467 --> 00:08:34.300
"have."

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:40.300
So this is an argument about
Harry not being a "have" on

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:47.100
his own, but becoming a "have"
by virtue of either a

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.567
channeling process
by way of Marie.

00:08:50.567 --> 00:08:54.433
And he is channeled through
Marie both because of the way

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:57.933
she thinks about him, and also
because of the way he looks at

00:08:57.933 --> 00:09:01.133
her, and he is contrasted with
Richard Gordon, both because

00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:04.133
of the way Richard looks at
Marie, and because of the way

00:09:04.133 --> 00:09:06.600
Richard Gordon talks to
his own wife, Helen.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:11.100
So it's very much a permutation,
kind of a dance

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.467
really, among the characters in
order for Harry to emerge

00:09:15.467 --> 00:09:18.100
as a "have" at the very end.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.533
But first of all, let's go back
to the macro history of

00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:26.533
Cuba in the 1930s.

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:31.900
As you can see, the politics
of Cuba was incredibly

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.867
complicated in the '30s.

00:09:33.867 --> 00:09:40.000
There were six presidents in
three years, so you are under

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.033
no obligation to remember the
names of the presidents.

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:45.000
I won't even pronounce
the names.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.033
So I just wanted to give you a
sense of how long they were

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:49.467
presidents.

00:09:49.467 --> 00:09:52.833
Most of the presidents were
presidents for just a few

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:59.967
months, in this case, less than
a month, less than just a

00:09:59.967 --> 00:10:03.567
few months in the case
of Ramon Grau.

00:10:03.567 --> 00:10:09.100
Just for three days in the
case of Carlos Hevia.

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.767
This beats everything.

00:10:10.767 --> 00:10:15.500
He was president for just one
day, Manuel Marquez Sterling.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:21.133
And then slightly longer, a few
months-- that's a record--

00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:23.500
and a few months.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:28.100
So I think that it's just really
clear just from looking

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:35.667
at the list of presidents of
Cuba between 1933 and 1936

00:10:35.667 --> 00:10:40.367
that the politics was just
incredibly hard to figure out.

00:10:40.367 --> 00:10:43.600
As I mentioned last time,
Hemingway was actually not in

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.767
Cuba when he was writing
To Have and Have Not.

00:10:45.767 --> 00:10:47.733
He was in the Bahamas.

00:10:47.733 --> 00:10:54.200
So it's highly improbable that
he would have been able to

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.667
figure out the politics in
Cuba in any intimate way.

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:02.533
He would have been looking at it
very much from the outside.

00:11:02.533 --> 00:11:04.567
He probably understood the
politics of the Spanish Civil

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:09.167
War that he was covering much,
much better than the actual

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:12.533
politics in Cuba that
was his setting.

00:11:12.533 --> 00:11:17.567
So as a consequence,
the presidents of

00:11:17.567 --> 00:11:19.000
Cuba were never mentioned.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.233
We don't even know who
was president then.

00:11:23.233 --> 00:11:28.567
Instead, what Hemingway gives
us is a generic type.

00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:34.233
This is the young boy, Emilio,
who is one of the passengers

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:38.833
that has to be carried back to
Havana after the bank robbery.

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:45.033
So this is the very dangerous
trip for Harry.

00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:49.300
But he gets to talk to the boy
quite a bit and liked him, but

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.900
also kills him, but this is
a generic type of the

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:57.067
revolutionary, marked by
his speech pattern.

00:11:57.067 --> 00:11:59.767
"'We are the only true
revolutionary

00:11:59.767 --> 00:12:01.933
party,' the boy said.

00:12:01.933 --> 00:12:05.300
'We want to do away with all the
bold politicians, with all

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:09.267
the American imperialism that
strangles us, with the tyranny

00:12:09.267 --> 00:12:10.467
of the army.

00:12:10.467 --> 00:12:14.467
We want to start clean and
give every man a chance.

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:17.467
We want to end slavery
of the guajiros,

00:12:17.467 --> 00:12:19.300
you know, the peasants.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.667
We just raise money for the
fight," the boy said.

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:25.900
"To do that, we have to
use means that later

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.000
we would never use.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.500
Also we have to use people we
would not employ later.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.433
But the end is worth
the means.'"

00:12:35.433 --> 00:12:38.100
Emilio is a young boy.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.433
But he talks like a
much older person.

00:12:41.433 --> 00:12:44.967
There's actually a lot of
authority, and I don't think

00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:51.000
that Hemingway is just giving
this to us as a caricature.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.567
This certain kind of authority
that comes from a certain

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:58.500
vocabulary, a certain
speech pattern.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.900
The boy almost didn't have to
think in order to say all

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.800
those things because he's so
familiar with that kind of

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.633
phrasing, that kind of idiom.

00:13:08.633 --> 00:13:13.033
He's completely conditioned in
that idiom, so that it really

00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:16.533
is second nature to him.

00:13:16.533 --> 00:13:19.300
We can think a little bit about
what it means to have

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.400
that kind of second nature.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:25.500
I think that most of us tend to
think that it is not good

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.433
to have that kind of language
grilled into us so that it's

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.033
almost a kind of reflex
action for it to come

00:13:32.033 --> 00:13:33.667
out just like that.

00:13:33.667 --> 00:13:37.200
I think we tend to be very
suspicious of people who talk

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:43.067
in this kind of very dogmatic
and generic kind of language,

00:13:43.067 --> 00:13:45.833
that you can hear two sentences
and you know that

00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:50.000
this man is a radical, and he's
wearing his radicalism on

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.033
his sleeve.

00:13:51.033 --> 00:13:56.800
So this is a man who, in many
ways, we don't even know if

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.533
his true name is Emilio.

00:13:59.533 --> 00:14:04.333
He just says to Harry, you
can call me Emilio.

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:08.333
Going back to that famous line
in Moby Dick, "call me

00:14:08.333 --> 00:14:10.700
Ishmael." Many, many characters
in American

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.533
literature would say to another
character, "Call me

00:14:13.533 --> 00:14:16.700
something." This is a very, very
minor local instance of

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:20.467
this, but we don't know
his true name.

00:14:20.467 --> 00:14:23.167
He's just known by
the name Emilio.

00:14:23.167 --> 00:14:25.467
That in itself is emblematic
of the kind of

00:14:25.467 --> 00:14:28.400
character that he is.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.467
But I want to go back to the
point about what it means to

00:14:31.467 --> 00:14:36.900
have a second nature, and second
linguistic nature.

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.167
Even though our instinct, our
gut reaction, is to be very

00:14:41.167 --> 00:14:45.367
suspicious of someone like that,
I actually want to make

00:14:45.367 --> 00:14:51.367
the point that having a second
nature like that is probably

00:14:51.367 --> 00:14:56.933
not the worst thing a human
being can have. It is probably

00:14:56.933 --> 00:15:01.400
not the best thing a human
being can have, but it

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.333
probably is not the
worst thing.

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:11.567
Because it is a sort of
religious faith that is cast

00:15:11.567 --> 00:15:14.033
in secular language.

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:18.100
To the extent that we think that
human beings need some

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:19.367
kind of faith.

00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:23.233
It actually is very, very good
to have that second nature.

00:15:23.233 --> 00:15:28.967
So I think that Hemingway is
partly caricaturing that style

00:15:28.967 --> 00:15:29.967
of talking.

00:15:29.967 --> 00:15:34.100
But he's showing us what it
means to have your being

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.167
within that kind of language.

00:15:36.167 --> 00:15:39.867
It's a problematic kind of
being, most of us would reject

00:15:39.867 --> 00:15:44.033
it, but it is a kind of a
viable kind of being.

00:15:44.033 --> 00:15:47.900
In contrast, we can
look at Harry --

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.167
and this is the first instance
when I would like to make a

00:15:51.167 --> 00:15:54.300
case for Harry as
a "have not" --

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.633
is that he just doesn't have
that kind of political

00:15:57.633 --> 00:15:58.467
conviction.

00:15:58.467 --> 00:16:02.533
He doesn't have the second
nature that is second nature

00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:05.267
to Emilio, and as
a consequence,

00:16:05.267 --> 00:16:08.167
that's how he talks.

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.867
"I want a drink, Harry
was thinking.

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:14.467
What the hell do I care about
his revolution, f-word his

00:16:14.467 --> 00:16:15.667
revolution.

00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:19.500
To help the working man who robs
a bank and kills a fellow

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.667
works with him, and then kills
that poor damned Albert that

00:16:22.667 --> 00:16:24.767
never did any harm.

00:16:24.767 --> 00:16:26.733
That's a working man he kills.

00:16:26.733 --> 00:16:29.700
He never thinks of that
with a family.

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.467
It's the Cubans run Cuba they
are double-cross each other,

00:16:33.467 --> 00:16:35.233
they sell each other out.

00:16:35.233 --> 00:16:36.967
They get what they deserve.

00:16:36.967 --> 00:16:38.967
To hell with their
revolutions.

00:16:38.967 --> 00:16:42.133
All I got to do is make a living
for my family and I

00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:43.467
can't do that.

00:16:43.467 --> 00:16:45.933
Then he tells me about
his revolution.

00:16:45.933 --> 00:16:49.467
To hell with his revolution."

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:53.833
It's a reaction that probably
most of us would have. The

00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:57.900
Cubans, especially in the '30s,
that sort of revolution

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:02.533
would feel that way to most
people who were outside of it.

00:17:02.533 --> 00:17:06.567
But the point remains that
feeling that way about the

00:17:06.567 --> 00:17:14.433
revolution gives Harry no
alternative moral grounding.

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:20.533
This speech is almost completely
empty of any kind

00:17:20.533 --> 00:17:26.467
of moral foundation, any kind
of political conviction.

00:17:26.467 --> 00:17:33.167
All he can say is I want a drink
at this moment, and that

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:36.967
I want to make a living for my
family and I can't do that.

00:17:36.967 --> 00:17:42.000
So it is almost a kind of total
admission of defeat

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.400
without having this dubious
saving grace of some sort of

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.400
political conviction that can
point to some sort of exit

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.967
from this horrible condition
that you're in.

00:17:55.967 --> 00:18:00.733
I'm not saying that Emilio
represents a superior

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:02.567
alternative to Harry.

00:18:02.567 --> 00:18:04.200
Quite the contrary.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.633
He's deluded.

00:18:05.633 --> 00:18:08.367
I think that Hemingway
is not leaving a lot

00:18:08.367 --> 00:18:09.633
of doubt about that.

00:18:09.633 --> 00:18:15.100
Emilio is deluded, but at
certain points in one's life,

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:19.167
a certain degree of willful
delusion is actually a very

00:18:19.167 --> 00:18:25.667
necessary fiction that lost
human beings need.

00:18:25.667 --> 00:18:29.367
It is probably better for Emilio
to die still clinging

00:18:29.367 --> 00:18:31.800
to that political conviction.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:35.900
This is what happens to Harry
when he cannot cling, when

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:38.433
there's really nothing
for him to cling to.

00:18:38.433 --> 00:18:44.900
When he's relying completely on
his own mental resources,

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:47.600
and there's not a whole lot
for him to cling to.

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:52.800
He's a pretty empty person
left his own devices.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.567
So I would argue that this is
the first instance of Harry as

00:18:56.567 --> 00:18:59.600
a "have not" only in the sense
that he doesn't have that

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:05.300
dubious, but redeeming kind
of second nature.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:09.133
We also know that the Cuban
revolutions, such as they

00:19:09.133 --> 00:19:14.633
were, were not the only
reference point for the novel.

00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:18.133
To Have and Have Not is very
much about Key West and Key

00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:20.500
West during the Great
Depression.

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.500
So this is Hemingway's house, a
very beautiful house, in Key

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.933
West that he spends a lot of
time in later, actually much,

00:19:26.933 --> 00:19:29.733
much later, not at this point.

00:19:29.733 --> 00:19:34.800
But this would have been what
people in Key West would have

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:40.100
seen in during the Great
Depression, the bread lines.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.233
This is one that is
actually from the

00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:44.867
Florida historical archives.

00:19:44.867 --> 00:19:50.433
Most likely Key West, because
Key West, which is a very

00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:53.200
prosperous city before the
Great Depression, was

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:55.767
especially hard hit
by the depression.

00:19:55.767 --> 00:19:58.767
So the unemployment
rate was 80%--

00:19:58.767 --> 00:20:02.967
80%, of the citizens were
actually on relief, and we see

00:20:02.967 --> 00:20:05.800
that Albert is someone
who was on relief.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.867
So this is about the most acute
case study of the Great

00:20:10.867 --> 00:20:14.967
Depression that we'll get in
American literature, except

00:20:14.967 --> 00:20:17.700
that Hemingway is not really
talking about the Great

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.900
Depression in a frontal way.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.533
We can look at the way in which
even the word Great

00:20:23.533 --> 00:20:28.833
Depression, without even the
great, suggested to us that

00:20:28.833 --> 00:20:32.500
that is an illusion to that
historical context.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.233
So this is how the Great
Depression is

00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:38.733
registered by Harry.

00:20:38.733 --> 00:20:42.900
"On the booze boat, Harry
had the last sack over.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.033
'Give me the fish knife,'
he said to the nigger.

00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:51.267
'It's gone.' Harry pressed the
self-starter and started the

00:20:51.267 --> 00:20:52.700
two engines.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:56.533
He put a second engine in her
when he went back to running

00:20:56.533 --> 00:21:02.300
liquor when the depression had
put charter boat fishing on

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.667
the bum."

00:21:03.667 --> 00:21:10.900
So there are at least two ways
in which Harry, as a smuggler

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.200
of liquor, two ways in which
that is contextualized.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.133
First we don't know about it.

00:21:18.133 --> 00:21:21.400
We can only conjecture
in part one.

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:29.833
In part two, Harry is both
review to us as a smuggler,

00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:32.667
but we just think that maybe
that's just something he

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:34.533
chooses to do.

00:21:34.533 --> 00:21:39.167
But then it comes out in the
context of the Great

00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:45.333
Depression that he goes back
to it, because the Great

00:21:45.333 --> 00:21:50.700
Depression has made the much
more profitable charter boat

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.567
fishing impossible.

00:21:53.567 --> 00:21:57.300
In part one he was still doing
the charter boat fishing when

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:01.433
he was cheated out of
$825 by Mr. Johnson.

00:22:01.433 --> 00:22:03.933
That was still the charter
boat fishing.

00:22:03.933 --> 00:22:06.300
That is no longer operative.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:09.600
The only way he could make a
living is by smuggling liquor

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.067
into the United States.

00:22:11.067 --> 00:22:16.933
So right then, that is the way
this very oblique, very

00:22:16.933 --> 00:22:22.867
elusive way is the way Hemingway
indexes the Great

00:22:22.867 --> 00:22:23.400
Depression.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:27.200
I think that it's really
useful to think of the

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.467
technique that Hemingway is
using as a kind of indexing.

00:22:30.467 --> 00:22:33.900
It's not a frontal, a full
dressed description of the

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:40.800
Great Depression, it's just a
cameo appearance that puts the

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.667
depression in the index of
the state of the novel.

00:22:44.667 --> 00:22:47.267
But if it doesn't engage it or
put it in the foreground.

00:22:50.167 --> 00:22:52.600
I hope that you guys will talk
about it in section, and why

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.333
he chooses to talk about the
depression in that way, in

00:22:55.333 --> 00:22:57.800
this very oblique fashion.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:05.067
But in this passage we can also
see that Harry is a "have

00:23:05.067 --> 00:23:09.167
not" for at least
three reasons.

00:23:09.167 --> 00:23:12.867
One is that he's lost his
original occupation, although

00:23:12.867 --> 00:23:14.233
there's also the reference
that he's

00:23:14.233 --> 00:23:16.833
going back to running.

00:23:16.833 --> 00:23:19.267
So he must have been doing that
at some earlier point.

00:23:19.267 --> 00:23:20.567
We don't know why
he was doing it.

00:23:20.567 --> 00:23:23.767
All we know is that he had been
law abiding for quite a

00:23:23.767 --> 00:23:28.933
while as an owner of a charter
boat, and now he's doing

00:23:28.933 --> 00:23:31.100
something that is illegal
because of the Great

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:31.433
Depression.

00:23:31.433 --> 00:23:35.200
So he loses his legal
occupation.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.033
Right now we also know that he's
losing, actually, all his

00:23:39.033 --> 00:23:45.267
liquor, because the customs are
on him so he has to get

00:23:45.267 --> 00:23:49.933
rid of all his liquor that
cost a lot of money.

00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:53.933
But not only that, even that
small detail about this fish

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:56.400
knife, even that is gone.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:24:02.367
So in many ways To Have and Have
Not is very detailed from

00:24:02.367 --> 00:24:06.633
the macro to the micro catalog
of all the things that are

00:24:06.633 --> 00:24:09.567
being taken away from Harry.

00:24:09.567 --> 00:24:11.733
It really is adding
insult to injury.

00:24:11.733 --> 00:24:14.800
You lose in a big way; you also
lose in a very small way.

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:20.000
That's really the landscape
of loss that Hemingway has

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.300
created for Harry Morgan.

00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:30.533
Just one another portrait of him
as a "have not," and this

00:24:30.533 --> 00:24:39.300
is Harry thinking about he knows
that those Cubans want

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.967
to be taken back to Havana.

00:24:41.967 --> 00:24:45.133
He knows that they're going to
rob a bank, because every time

00:24:45.133 --> 00:24:47.700
he walks by a bank, he doesn't
want to look at the bank.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.467
So he actually knows that that's
what's going to happen.

00:24:50.467 --> 00:24:57.133
He's not so gullible as not to
know the purpose of that trip.

00:24:57.133 --> 00:25:03.467
But he is not in a position
to make any other

00:25:03.467 --> 00:25:05.333
choices at that point.

00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:10.367
So I would say that this is the
ultimate measure of Harry

00:25:10.367 --> 00:25:14.533
as a "have not" is knowing that
he should not be doing

00:25:14.533 --> 00:25:18.300
it, but having no other
choice open to him.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.667
"I could stay here now and I'll
be out of it, but what

00:25:21.667 --> 00:25:23.333
the hell would they eat on.

00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:26.333
Where's the money coming from
to keep Marie and the girls?

00:25:26.333 --> 00:25:31.133
I've got no boat, no cash,
I've got no education.

00:25:31.133 --> 00:25:33.967
What can a one-armed
man work at?

00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:38.200
All I've got is my cojones
to peddle."

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:43.600
So this is kind of the ultimate
blow against someone

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:49.067
who would like to operate as an
individual is to be able at

00:25:49.067 --> 00:25:53.067
least to make a decision based
on your own judgment.

00:25:53.067 --> 00:25:58.367
Everything in Harry's judgment
tells him that this is not

00:25:58.367 --> 00:26:00.233
something to do.

00:26:00.233 --> 00:26:03.200
His judgment is not at fault.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.500
His hands are tied.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.767
He has to go against his
judgment and do something that

00:26:09.767 --> 00:26:15.400
everything in him would recoil
against and warn him against.

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.767
So this is the ultimate
emptying out of --

00:26:20.767 --> 00:26:26.500
every decisional process has
been taken away from Harry.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.300
He loses material objects
like the boat.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:33.400
The boat was confiscated by
customs after he was found to

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:38.033
be illegally smuggling liquor
that was confiscated, so taken

00:26:38.033 --> 00:26:39.667
away from him.

00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:42.000
Now we know that he has no
money, and obviously no

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.633
education, and missing
one arm.

00:26:45.633 --> 00:26:49.833
So it's at this moment, this is
the absolute low point, I

00:26:49.833 --> 00:26:52.667
would say, for Harry.

00:26:52.667 --> 00:26:59.500
And now I want to go to a
slightly different trajectory.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:04.267
What I like to suggest is
actually the beginning of an

00:27:04.267 --> 00:27:06.067
outward trajectory.

00:27:06.067 --> 00:27:09.533
The beginning of this outward
trajectory is going to be

00:27:09.533 --> 00:27:11.067
very, very stark.

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:18.267
It is Harry as an ironic "have."
This is the moment

00:27:18.267 --> 00:27:20.167
when we know that
Harry is dying.

00:27:20.167 --> 00:27:22.133
He's been wounded.

00:27:22.133 --> 00:27:24.767
All the Cubans were
killed by Harry.

00:27:24.767 --> 00:27:27.967
And Harry was also fatally
wounded by

00:27:27.967 --> 00:27:30.433
Roberto, the big Cuban.

00:27:30.433 --> 00:27:34.967
So all of them were dying on
the boat, but Harry was the

00:27:34.967 --> 00:27:37.767
last to die.

00:27:37.767 --> 00:27:41.133
This is the moment before
his death, and what

00:27:41.133 --> 00:27:44.533
he has at that moment.

00:27:44.533 --> 00:27:48.800
"He was on his back now with
his knees drawn up

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.400
and his head back.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:55.133
The water of the lake, that was
his valley, was very cold.

00:27:55.133 --> 00:27:59.633
So cold that when he stepped in
to its edge in numbed him.

00:27:59.633 --> 00:28:03.900
And he was extremely cold now,
and everything tasted of

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.633
gasoline, as though he had
been sucking on a hose to

00:28:07.633 --> 00:28:09.767
siphon a tank.

00:28:09.767 --> 00:28:14.500
He knew there was no tank,
although he could feel a cold

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:18.033
rubber hose that seemed to have
entered his mouth, and

00:28:18.033 --> 00:28:22.933
now was coiled, big, cold, and
heavy all down through him.

00:28:22.933 --> 00:28:27.167
Each time he took a breath the
hose, coiled, colder, and

00:28:27.167 --> 00:28:31.900
firmer in his lower abdomen,
and he could feel it like a

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:37.667
big, smooth moving snake in
there about the sloshing of

00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:39.567
the lake."

00:28:39.567 --> 00:28:41.433
This is in chapter 20.

00:28:41.433 --> 00:28:44.967
Chapter 20, I urge you to
read that chapter at

00:28:44.967 --> 00:28:46.333
least a couple of times.

00:28:46.333 --> 00:28:49.667
It is great, great writing.

00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:55.733
When the critics admitted to
having really impressive prose

00:28:55.733 --> 00:28:58.867
in To Have and Have Not, they
must have been thinking of

00:28:58.867 --> 00:28:59.900
Chapter 20.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.167
It's just a great chapter, and
it's about a boat with dead

00:29:04.167 --> 00:29:10.333
men and the fish coming to fish
on the drippings from the

00:29:10.333 --> 00:29:12.600
wounds on the dead man.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:18.433
But it's a great description of
human mortality against a

00:29:18.433 --> 00:29:20.333
sea of very vibrant, and

00:29:20.333 --> 00:29:23.533
obviously, living sea creatures.

00:29:23.533 --> 00:29:29.100
But the passage right here is
a description, and I think

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:32.600
that it maybe is a challenge
from Hemingway -- although I

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.167
wouldn't want to push
this too much --

00:29:37.167 --> 00:29:42.700
a challenge to us think about
what it means to die, and what

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:48.800
exactly do we have at
the moment of death.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:51.967
Harry actually does have
something, although it's not

00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:55.167
anything that anyone would
want to have. He has this

00:29:55.167 --> 00:29:58.167
rubber hose that is inside
him that's making

00:29:58.167 --> 00:30:01.333
him colder and colder.

00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:06.867
It is not a possession that
we would volunteer for.

00:30:06.867 --> 00:30:09.300
It's a possession that most
of us would like to have

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.767
taken out of us.

00:30:11.767 --> 00:30:15.767
But it's a possession
nonetheless.

00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:22.000
So I would like to at least
put forth the possible

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.700
argument that because
of the kind of life

00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.167
that Harry has lived.

00:30:30.167 --> 00:30:33.633
Even though there's so many
strikes against him, even

00:30:33.633 --> 00:30:37.733
though all the odds are against
him, the moment of

00:30:37.733 --> 00:30:42.833
death actually is his own moment
in the sense that he's

00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:49.633
living his physicality to his
fullest. But this is not dying

00:30:49.633 --> 00:30:52.167
without knowing that you were
dying, although he does lose

00:30:52.167 --> 00:30:54.433
consciousness after that.

00:30:54.433 --> 00:30:59.867
It is experiencing that
to its fullest extent.

00:30:59.867 --> 00:31:08.967
And just having that register on
every fiber of your being.

00:31:08.967 --> 00:31:14.133
I don't know how much we want
to push on this point, but I

00:31:14.133 --> 00:31:17.800
like to see this as the
beginning of a kind of upward

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:20.667
swing of the narrative.

00:31:20.667 --> 00:31:26.133
That this is the moment when we
can begin to stop thinking

00:31:26.133 --> 00:31:31.333
of Harry as a "have not," and to
start thinking of him as a

00:31:31.333 --> 00:31:36.300
"have," although a "have" in a
very ironic sense, having a

00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:40.367
possession that most of us would
much rather not have.

00:31:40.367 --> 00:31:46.467
But from this point, I like to
make a much more systematic

00:31:46.467 --> 00:31:51.333
argument about Harry as a
"have," and I do think that

00:31:51.333 --> 00:31:54.067
this is something that Hemingway
is doing in a very

00:31:54.067 --> 00:31:55.033
deliberate fashion.

00:31:55.033 --> 00:31:57.900
So I would very much want to
argue that this is actually

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:02.567
the basic structure of To Have
and Have Not is to show Harry

00:32:02.567 --> 00:32:04.867
as a "have" through
the mediated

00:32:04.867 --> 00:32:06.133
presence of other people.

00:32:06.133 --> 00:32:09.500
So we'll be looking at him
through the Marie, and looking

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.467
at him through Richard Gordon.

00:32:12.467 --> 00:32:17.467
So what Marie thinks
about Harry.

00:32:17.467 --> 00:32:19.800
"I'm lucky, she was thinking.

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.533
Those girls, they don't
know what they'll get.

00:32:22.533 --> 00:32:26.000
I know what I've got
and what I've had.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.167
I've been a lucky woman.

00:32:28.167 --> 00:32:30.533
I've been a lucky woman.

00:32:30.533 --> 00:32:32.533
There ain't no other
man like that.

00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:34.533
People ain't never tried
them, don't know.

00:32:34.533 --> 00:32:36.267
I've had plenty of them.

00:32:36.267 --> 00:32:44.800
I've been lucky to have him."
It's suggested to us that

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.367
Marie was a sporting woman.

00:32:48.367 --> 00:32:50.833
That was her profession.

00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:54.633
So she's had lots of men in
her professional capacity.

00:32:57.933 --> 00:33:02.967
It is from that wealth of
knowledge of men that she can

00:33:02.967 --> 00:33:11.067
say that Harry is, at that
point, is the best. That she's

00:33:11.067 --> 00:33:14.667
tried them all, and there's
just no one like Harry.

00:33:14.667 --> 00:33:17.067
So it's a dubious kind
of compliment.

00:33:17.067 --> 00:33:21.900
You don't want to have a
prostitute testifying to the

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:24.400
fact that you are the
best when that

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.367
happens to be your wife.

00:33:26.367 --> 00:33:30.000
So once again, Hemingway is
really taking away with one

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.467
hand what he's giving
with another.

00:33:32.467 --> 00:33:41.233
But there is no question that
Harry has made Marie's life

00:33:41.233 --> 00:33:43.867
the life that she's enjoying
that moment.

00:33:43.867 --> 00:33:46.067
That she's having a good life.

00:33:46.067 --> 00:33:49.800
She's having a good life
only because of him.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:57.133
He is the thing that gives her
a good life and that is the

00:33:57.133 --> 00:34:00.200
measure of what Harry has.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.900
So it's a much more complicated
mediated kind.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:06.533
He has something because of the
good life that Marie has

00:34:06.533 --> 00:34:07.667
because of him.

00:34:07.667 --> 00:34:12.067
And without Marie, we wouldn't
have been able to say that.

00:34:12.067 --> 00:34:16.533
So this is the first upward
swing of that trajectory

00:34:16.533 --> 00:34:21.833
towards Harry as a possible
Have. I would like to add that

00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:25.900
is not just because of the way
that he's treated Marie, and

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:28.800
the way that Marie is
now having a good

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.967
life because of him.

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:33.367
But also because of the
way he looks at Marie.

00:34:33.367 --> 00:34:35.867
So there is action coming
from him as well.

00:34:35.867 --> 00:34:40.867
We can sort of understand why
Marie is having a good life

00:34:40.867 --> 00:34:46.733
now, and why he has made all
the difference to her life.

00:34:46.733 --> 00:34:50.400
So here, Harry is going on this
dangerous trip with the

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.200
Cubans when he knows
that it's the bank

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.433
robbery that is at stake.

00:34:55.433 --> 00:34:59.267
Marie wanted to go with him just
to take care of the jugs,

00:34:59.267 --> 00:35:01.133
because he has only one
arm at this point.

00:35:01.133 --> 00:35:04.267
She wants to do something for
him on the boat and she wanted

00:35:04.267 --> 00:35:05.267
to come along.

00:35:05.267 --> 00:35:08.400
So he said, "All right," he
told her, And she got in

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:14.633
beside him, a big woman,
long-legged, big-handed, big

00:35:14.633 --> 00:35:19.367
hip, still handsome, a hat
pulled down over her

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:20.900
bleach-blonde hair.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:23.233
"What are you worried
about, Harry?

00:35:23.233 --> 00:35:23.967
I don't know.

00:35:23.967 --> 00:35:25.000
I'm just worried.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Listen, are you letting
your hair grow out?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:28.900
I thought I would.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.400
The girls have been asking me.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.667
To hell with them.

00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:32.967
You keep it like it is.

00:35:32.967 --> 00:35:34.833
Do you really want me to?

00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:36.633
Yes, he said, that's
the way I like it.

00:35:36.633 --> 00:35:38.200
You don't think I
look too old?

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.567
You look better than
any of them.

00:35:40.567 --> 00:35:41.733
So that's why.

00:35:41.733 --> 00:35:45.600
That's why Marie has a good
life is because of the way

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:51.167
Harry treats her, and we see
exactly how he treats her that

00:35:51.167 --> 00:35:56.833
he likes the way she is, and
he tells her that he's

00:35:56.833 --> 00:35:59.567
worried, but he doesn't
want to tell her full

00:35:59.567 --> 00:36:01.500
extent of his worry.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.800
So he changes the subject when
she wants to find out more.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.867
All this make Marie's
life a good life.

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:16.267
And it is all encapsulated in
this one small passage.

00:36:16.267 --> 00:36:21.600
The contrast of that comes out
in that previous passage.

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.767
We know that Marie is probably
a big woman.

00:36:24.767 --> 00:36:29.700
She is long-legged, big hands,
big hips, and so on.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:38.100
We don't know exactly how big
she is until we get to see her

00:36:38.100 --> 00:36:41.167
through the eyes of
Richard Gordon.

00:36:41.167 --> 00:36:46.267
Then it's kind of a shock to
see this passage coming

00:36:46.267 --> 00:36:51.733
through the eyes of a neutral or
hostile observer, although

00:36:51.733 --> 00:36:54.033
not really hostile, it's
really neutral.

00:36:54.033 --> 00:36:57.967
But a very unkind neutral
observer.

00:36:57.967 --> 00:37:02.700
"Riding his bicycle he passed
a heavy-set, big, blue-eyed

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:06.167
woman with bleached-blond hair
showing under her old man's

00:37:06.167 --> 00:37:09.167
styled hat, hurrying across
the road, her

00:37:09.167 --> 00:37:11.100
eyes red from crying.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:14.100
Look at that big
ox, he thought.

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.900
What do you suppose a woman
like that thinks about?

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.867
What do you suppose
she does in bed?

00:37:19.867 --> 00:37:23.333
What does her husband feel about
her when she gets that

00:37:23.333 --> 00:37:24.467
size?"

00:37:24.467 --> 00:37:28.333
"In today's chapter, he was
going to use the big woman

00:37:28.333 --> 00:37:32.767
with the tear-reddened eyes he
had just seen on the way home.

00:37:32.767 --> 00:37:36.667
Her husband, when he came home
at night, hated her, hated the

00:37:36.667 --> 00:37:41.300
way she had coarsened and grown
heavy, was repelled by

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.033
her bleached hair, the
two big breasts.

00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:49.167
He has seen in a flash of
perception, the whole inner

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:52.467
life of that type of woman."

00:37:52.467 --> 00:37:57.600
So Hemingway is both dramatizing
the process of

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:04.333
labeling people, the making of
social types, and showing

00:38:04.333 --> 00:38:09.667
considerable doubt whether that
is a good practice, to

00:38:09.667 --> 00:38:13.433
say the least. It is really
interesting that Richard

00:38:13.433 --> 00:38:17.700
Gordon is a writer, so I think
that Hemingway is probably

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.767
thinking about himself as well
and whether it's an entirely

00:38:21.767 --> 00:38:24.933
ethical practice even
to populate his

00:38:24.933 --> 00:38:26.967
novel with social types.

00:38:26.967 --> 00:38:30.567
I mean right now he's actually
creating another social type

00:38:30.567 --> 00:38:33.600
of writer who doesn't care about
his subject and the only

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:37.333
wants to use them to write
novels to his own

00:38:37.333 --> 00:38:39.000
satisfaction.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.633
So this is --

00:38:40.633 --> 00:38:45.433
he's both talking about Richard
Gordon, and maybe

00:38:45.433 --> 00:38:48.567
expressing a little bit of worry
about himself as well.

00:38:48.567 --> 00:38:52.433
But in any case, if we move
away from Hemingway's own

00:38:52.433 --> 00:38:57.167
investment and his psychology,
possible psychology in

00:38:57.167 --> 00:39:00.933
creating someone like Richard
Gordon, we can say that this

00:39:00.933 --> 00:39:08.833
is a direct affirmation
of what a kind man

00:39:08.833 --> 00:39:10.667
Harry Morgan is.

00:39:10.667 --> 00:39:14.533
And it's not just kindness that
enables him to look past

00:39:14.533 --> 00:39:16.233
the bigness of Marie.

00:39:16.233 --> 00:39:18.367
It's probably not just
kindness, and

00:39:18.367 --> 00:39:19.733
understating the case.

00:39:19.733 --> 00:39:21.367
It's something else.

00:39:21.367 --> 00:39:25.900
That it truly doesn't bother
him that she's so big.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.100
When it's probably what
most of the women

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.767
notice that about her.

00:39:30.767 --> 00:39:37.200
So it says something about that
relationship, whatever we

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.267
call it, it is one that
turns a big woman

00:39:40.267 --> 00:39:42.467
into a beautiful woman.

00:39:42.467 --> 00:39:47.133
And to the extent that Harry is
able to do that, he is kind

00:39:47.133 --> 00:39:49.667
of a magician of sorts.

00:39:49.667 --> 00:39:56.300
He has a kind of emotional magic
that changes Marie into

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.700
something else.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:03.600
In a process of that
transformation, he also

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.700
acquires an identity.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:09.733
He is the person who's able
to do this to Marie

00:40:09.733 --> 00:40:11.700
and do this for Marie.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.933
This is the ultimate measure
of someone who has

00:40:14.933 --> 00:40:17.400
magic in his hands.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.333
It is the lack of magic that
makes Richard Gordon the

00:40:22.333 --> 00:40:24.700
washed-out writer that he is.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.133
Richard Gordon was probably once
a very, very good writer.

00:40:28.133 --> 00:40:32.033
He has admirers, as we see, who
are thrilled to meet him.

00:40:32.033 --> 00:40:36.267
But at the point we're meeting
him, the craft of writing

00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:38.967
seems to be on the wane.

00:40:38.967 --> 00:40:44.333
We begin to see this, what a
bad writer he is in this

00:40:44.333 --> 00:40:48.133
supposedly neutral portrait
of Marie.

00:40:48.133 --> 00:40:51.167
It's that all he notices is
the size of this woman.

00:40:51.167 --> 00:40:55.100
He doesn't notice the most
important fact about Marie, is

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:57.267
that her eyes are
red from crying.

00:40:57.267 --> 00:40:59.733
He is solely through curiosity,
solely through

00:40:59.733 --> 00:41:03.567
imagination, that he misses
the central fact.

00:41:03.567 --> 00:41:07.800
This is when Marie knows that
Harry is dead, and that was

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.767
why her eyes are
tear-reddened.

00:41:10.767 --> 00:41:14.733
Richard Gordon is such a poor
writer that he cannot see the

00:41:14.733 --> 00:41:21.367
most obvious thing about Marie
in his eagerness to turn her

00:41:21.367 --> 00:41:24.900
into a social type.

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:29.233
In this exchange with his own
wife, we see the fact that

00:41:29.233 --> 00:41:34.167
he's a bad writer almost seems
to spill out, and has a kind

00:41:34.167 --> 00:41:38.733
of an analogy in his relation
with his wife, Helen, who is

00:41:38.733 --> 00:41:40.033
leaving him.

00:41:40.033 --> 00:41:43.667
And this is actually one
of the great moments.

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:48.167
I'm not quoting you the full
extent of Helen's speech, but

00:41:48.167 --> 00:41:53.300
go and look at page 185
when this long, long

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.033
speech about love.

00:41:56.033 --> 00:42:00.433
It's dripping with irony about
what she feels about love

00:42:00.433 --> 00:42:02.167
coming from Richard Gordon.

00:42:02.167 --> 00:42:04.533
But that is the end of
that conversation.

00:42:04.533 --> 00:42:06.967
"All right, I'm through
with you, and I'm

00:42:06.967 --> 00:42:08.300
through with love.

00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.100
Your kind of pick-nose love.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:12.067
You writer.

00:42:12.067 --> 00:42:14.333
You little mick slut.

00:42:14.333 --> 00:42:16.000
Don't call me names.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.133
I know the word for you.

00:42:17.133 --> 00:42:18.400
All right.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.467
No, not all right.

00:42:19.467 --> 00:42:21.367
All wrong and wrong again.

00:42:21.367 --> 00:42:24.467
If you were just a good writer,
I could stand for all

00:42:24.467 --> 00:42:26.000
the rest of it maybe.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.067
But I've seen you bitter,
jealous, changing your

00:42:29.067 --> 00:42:33.033
politics to suit the fashion,
sucking up to people's faces

00:42:33.033 --> 00:42:35.433
and talking about them
behind their backs.

00:42:35.433 --> 00:42:39.167
I've seen you until
I'm sick of you."

00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:43.800
So what kind of a person Richard
Gordon is can only be

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.333
registered in the full by
someone who is by his

00:42:47.333 --> 00:42:49.167
side all the time.

00:42:49.167 --> 00:42:52.533
That is the most accurate
picture of Richard Gordon, and

00:42:52.533 --> 00:42:53.767
that's the kind of
person he is.

00:42:53.767 --> 00:42:57.000
So it is a portrait that
completely cleans out

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.900
everything, that removes
everything.

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:04.400
His claim to fame, his claim to
craftsmanship, his claim to

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.100
writerly genius, his claim to
being a great romantic lover,

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.667
all of those things have
been emptied out by

00:43:11.667 --> 00:43:13.533
Helen in this moment.

00:43:13.533 --> 00:43:19.267
If we think about the symmetry
between Harry channeled

00:43:19.267 --> 00:43:24.233
through Marie, and Richard
Gordon channeled through

00:43:24.233 --> 00:43:29.933
Helen, it is very hard not to
come to the conclusion that we

00:43:29.933 --> 00:43:34.000
need to have an alternative
definition of what it means to

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.800
be a "have," and what it means
to be a "have not." It's not

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:47.833
so easy to add a label to what
the criteria might be for

00:43:47.833 --> 00:43:52.633
someone to count as a "have."
The criteria probably much too

00:43:52.633 --> 00:43:55.433
complicated to be captured just
by one word, and that's

00:43:55.433 --> 00:43:57.067
really the point.

00:43:57.067 --> 00:44:02.300
The simplest way to put it is
that in order to be a "have,"

00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:06.933
you have to make somebody else
a "have." Marie has a good

00:44:06.933 --> 00:44:11.500
life because of Harry, and Harry
has something because

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.300
Marie has a good life.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:18.300
This is the symmetrical
construction of "have" in

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.767
Hemingway's novel.

00:44:20.767 --> 00:44:24.500
So I would say that, actually
Hemingway is quite often

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:30.600
criticized for being a very poor
writer when it comes to

00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:32.133
women, and that is true.

00:44:32.133 --> 00:44:36.467
In most of his novels he has
no imagination for what it

00:44:36.467 --> 00:44:38.500
might feel to be a woman.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:41.000
But this is actually
an exception.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.300
This is an exceptionally
powerful depiction of the

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.267
human condition from the
woman's point of view.

00:44:48.267 --> 00:44:55.367
So in conclusion, I would like
to bring up one celebrated

00:44:55.367 --> 00:44:59.600
passage from Modernist writing
told from the standpoint of

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:01.300
the woman's point of view.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:04.100
Now, this is just a little
anecdote that Hemingway

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.467
actually has great admiration
for James Joyce.

00:45:06.467 --> 00:45:10.867
He saw James Joyce in Paris, he
saw Joyce eating with his

00:45:10.867 --> 00:45:14.167
family and they were all
speaking Italian in Paris.

00:45:14.167 --> 00:45:17.400
Hemingway was very,
very impressed.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:22.567
So it is not unfitting to
compare him with Joyce in this

00:45:22.567 --> 00:45:27.867
most famous passage in Joyce
Molly's soliloquy at the very

00:45:27.867 --> 00:45:30.033
end of Ulysses.

00:45:30.033 --> 00:45:34.667
"And I thought well, as
well him as another.

00:45:34.667 --> 00:45:38.500
And then I ask him with my
eyes to ask again, yes.

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:42.267
And then he asked me,
would I yes to say

00:45:42.267 --> 00:45:44.700
yes, my mountain flower.

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:48.567
And so as I put my arms around
him, yes, and drew him down to

00:45:48.567 --> 00:45:52.067
me so he could feel my
breasts, all perfume.

00:45:52.067 --> 00:45:53.033
Yes.

00:45:53.033 --> 00:45:55.100
And his heart was
going like mad.

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:57.467
And yes, I said yes, I will.

00:45:57.467 --> 00:45:58.133
Yes."

00:45:58.133 --> 00:46:00.533
So this is Molly Bloom
thinking about--

00:46:00.533 --> 00:46:01.933
it was a long time ago.

00:46:01.933 --> 00:46:05.200
The marriage has really gone
sour in many ways,

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.467
affairs and so on.

00:46:06.467 --> 00:46:11.167
But thinking back to that moment
when she agrees to

00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:16.667
marry Leopold Bloom, and Joyce
obviously wants to end Ulysses

00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:21.600
on that note, that very early
romance between two of them.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:25.567
A woman's love for a man, and
a man's love for a woman.

00:46:25.567 --> 00:46:30.500
This is not quite that.

00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.733
It's the opposite of that.

00:46:32.733 --> 00:46:35.100
But I would argue it's just as
powerful, even though it's not

00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:40.267
as well-known as Molly's
soliloquy is Marie's.

00:46:40.267 --> 00:46:43.767
"How do you get through nights
if you can't sleep.

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:46.800
I guess you find out, let you
find out out how it feels to

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.033
lose your husband.

00:46:48.033 --> 00:46:49.667
I guess you find
out all right.

00:46:49.667 --> 00:46:51.067
I guess you find out
everything in

00:46:51.067 --> 00:46:52.467
this goddamn life.

00:46:52.467 --> 00:46:53.633
I guess you do all right.

00:46:53.633 --> 00:46:56.833
I guess I'm probably finding out
right now you just go dead

00:46:56.833 --> 00:46:59.000
inside and everything is easy.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.333
You just get dead like most
people are most of the time.

00:47:02.333 --> 00:47:03.633
I guess that's how
it's all right.

00:47:03.633 --> 00:47:06.667
I guess that's just about
what happens to you.

00:47:06.667 --> 00:47:08.500
Well, I've got a good thought.

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:11.367
I've got a good thought if
that's what you have to do.

00:47:11.367 --> 00:47:13.500
I guess that's what you
have to do all right.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.533
I guess that's it.

00:47:14.533 --> 00:47:15.933
I guess that's what
it comes to.

00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:16.833
All right.

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.300
I've got a good start then.

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:22.767
I'm way ahead of
everybody now."

00:47:22.767 --> 00:47:26.000
Hemingway almost sounds like
Gertrude Stein, another of his

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.100
favorite people.

00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:30.733
And then it also sounds a little
bit like Hemingway.

00:47:30.733 --> 00:47:32.467
Tremendous admiration
for Gertrude Stein.

00:47:32.467 --> 00:47:34.500
He really does sound like
Gertrude Stein.

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:36.900
This is a kind of senseless
repetition.

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.267
This is not eloquent at all.

00:47:39.267 --> 00:47:44.600
It is compulsive repetition on
the part of Marie, and that is

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:50.133
the compulsive repetition that
comes to his own wife where

00:47:50.133 --> 00:47:54.033
she's had a good life and
that good life has been

00:47:54.033 --> 00:47:56.433
taken away from her.

00:47:56.433 --> 00:48:02.667
So both in fact that she's had
a good life, and in the fact

00:48:02.667 --> 00:48:05.333
that she's going hysterical
when that is

00:48:05.333 --> 00:48:06.533
taken away from her.

00:48:06.533 --> 00:48:12.433
In both instances, Marie attests
to what kind of a man

00:48:12.433 --> 00:48:16.700
Harry Morgan is and he
definitely is not a social

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:18.100
"have not."

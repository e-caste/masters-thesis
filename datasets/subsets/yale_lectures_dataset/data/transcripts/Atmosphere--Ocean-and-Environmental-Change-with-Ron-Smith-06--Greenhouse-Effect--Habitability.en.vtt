RONALD SMITH: So last time,
upstairs, we did this systems

00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:08.867
experiment where we had
a tank of water.

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:13.133
We tried to analyze it and
its three components--

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.833
the reservoir, the input,
and the output.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:20.467
We talked about things like
steady state balance,

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:25.833
transient response to changes
in the input and the output.

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:29.233
We derived a little mathematical
relationship

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:32.800
describing how the outflow
depends on the

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.600
depth of the water.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.300
We put those equations together,
we came up with a

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.233
prediction of what the
equilibrium water level would

00:00:41.233 --> 00:00:45.000
be for various values
of flow inputs.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.967
It worked out pretty well.

00:00:45.967 --> 00:00:47.967
We got fairly good quantitative

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:48.833
agreement on that.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:50.367
Are there any questions
on any of that?

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.500
So that's basic system
analysis.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.200
We're going to apply that
idea today to the energy

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.367
budget of the Earth.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.667
And we'll be applying it later
in the course to other simple

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:08.400
systems relating to the Earth.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.533
In this one, the input
is going to

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.267
be the solar radiation.

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:17.300
Sometimes it's called
insolation, with an o, not

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.800
insulation, but insolation.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.700
That's the rate at which solar
energy is approaching and then

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.367
finally being absorbed
by the Earth.

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:30.367
The loss is going to be the
infrared radiation to space.

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:34.267
We'll talk about the laws
that govern that today.

00:01:34.267 --> 00:01:38.733
And the heat storage will be not
the whole Earth, because

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.833
it takes too long for heat
to conduct in and

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:43.433
out of a whole Earth--

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:46.100
millions, if not hundreds
of millions of years.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.533
So really the system we're
talking about is just the skin

00:01:49.533 --> 00:01:53.400
of the Earth, the first few
meters are in the ocean, the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.200
first five kilometers or so.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.733
The part that is responsive to
the heat that's being put in

00:02:00.733 --> 00:02:01.667
and taken out.

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:05.033
So we will have a reservoir.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:06.600
We'll have inputs, we'll
have outputs.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.600
Now, there's one input we're
going to neglect.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.500
There is some heat in the deep
interior of the Earth that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.833
comes from the decay of
uranium that makes the

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:19.533
interior of the Earth
quite hot.

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:23.900
And that heat can leak out to
the surface of the Earth.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.133
That's called geothermal heat.

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:30.333
That can be important for
certain subjects, but for

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.167
climate studies that
is negligible.

00:02:33.167 --> 00:02:37.933
That's only a few-- a tiny
fraction of a watt per square

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:41.367
meter that reaches the Earth's
surface from the interior.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:43.833
And we'll see, these fluxes
are orders of

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.233
magnitude larger than that.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:47.500
So we're going to neglect
geothermal radiation--

00:02:50.633 --> 00:02:52.067
geothermal heat from
the interior.

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:55.700
We're also going to assume that
the Earth has a uniform

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.400
temperature.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.133
That's not a great assumption,
but in the beginning we're

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:03.867
going to just try to find a
formula that describes the

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.367
average temperature
of the Earth.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:09.433
Later on we'll be dealing
with the pole to equator

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:10.367
temperature gradients.

00:03:10.367 --> 00:03:12.467
But for now, the Earth
will have a

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:15.133
single temperature today.

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:18.800
And of course, we're going
to assume steady state.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.067
So we're going to use the kind
of formulation we did with the

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:24.200
water tank where we understand
the inputs and outputs.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.767
Sometimes they'll be out of
balance, but we're going to

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:29.600
make the assumption they'll be
in balance and use that to

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.367
solve for certain properties
of the system.

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:39.200
So that's the goal today, but
before I do that I've got to

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.067
talk to you about the
fundamental laws of radiation.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:55.833
Now, I mentioned this the other
day when we were talking

00:03:55.833 --> 00:04:00.800
about the stratosphere
and the thermosphere.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.800
If you have an object like
anything in this room, or the

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:15.800
Sun, or any object at all, and
you plot the emitted radiation

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.333
as a function of wavelengths--

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:22.267
I'll use the Greek letter
lambda to represent

00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:24.200
wavelength.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:33.600
That's the distance from the
crest to crest of the wave. It

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.933
looks something like this.

00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:36.667
I'm going to draw a bunch
of curves for different

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:37.900
temperatures.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.267
These are called black
body curves.

00:04:55.133 --> 00:04:56.900
It's also referred to sometimes

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.167
as the Plank Function.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.933
So if you've got a book on
physics, look up black body or

00:05:05.933 --> 00:05:09.800
look up the Plank Function and
read what it says about this.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.767
Now, this would be for
a cooler temperature.

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:17.700
This would be for some
intermediate temperature.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.233
And this would be for
a high temperature.

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:25.800
So for example, this might be
the surface of the Earth with

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.467
the temperature at 288 Kelvin.

00:05:28.467 --> 00:05:31.333
This might be for the surface
of the Sun with the

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:34.700
temperature of 6,000
degrees Kelvin.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.000
Notice two things about this.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.633
When you make the temperature
greater, of course, you're

00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:42.267
increasing the amount of
radiation that's coming out at

00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:45.533
every wavelength.

00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:52.167
Every wavelength the intensity
of the emitted radiation

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:55.133
increases with temperature.

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:57.433
As does the integral
under the curve.

00:05:57.433 --> 00:06:01.300
The total sum of all the
radiation is the area under

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:02.667
each of these curves.

00:06:02.667 --> 00:06:05.833
That total increases as well.

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:09.833
Furthermore, notice that the
peak of the curve shifts with

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:11.000
temperature.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.667
It's there for the cooler
temperature, there for the

00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:17.267
intermediate temperature,
and there for the higher

00:06:17.267 --> 00:06:18.200
temperature.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.833
So the color, if you like, the
color of the radiation changes

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:28.033
as the temperature of
the object changes.

00:06:28.033 --> 00:06:32.900
Now, there are names for these
particular aspects of the

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.300
radiation law.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.900
The shift in the peak is
referred to as Wien's law.

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:44.900
And it's given as by the
following formula.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.067
Lambda max is equal to a
constant divided by the

00:06:50.067 --> 00:06:51.967
temperature expressed
in Kelvins.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.133
And this lambda is going to
be in units of microns.

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:03.700
A micron is 10 to the
minus 6 meters.

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:17.200
Before I compute an example of
that, let me just remind you

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.367
of the electromagnetic spectrum
for a second.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.333
Wavelength increasing
to the right.

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:33.733
There's a range we call the
visible part of the spectrum

00:07:33.733 --> 00:07:39.000
that runs from 0.4
to 0.7 microns.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.933
The human eye is sensitive
to those waves.

00:07:42.933 --> 00:07:46.500
Then, as we spoke about last
time, the ultraviolet is over

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.800
here, and the infrared
is over there.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:57.733
Microwave is further over, and
then radio waves are further

00:07:57.733 --> 00:08:00.533
over to the right, and
X-rays are here.

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:08.467
So just to remind you, you might
want to remember 0.4 and

00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:12.767
0.7 as the range of the visible
part of the spectrum.

00:08:12.767 --> 00:08:14.800
Now, let's do a calculation
here.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.300
For the Sun, the surface
of the Sun is

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:23.033
approximately 6,000 Kelvin.

00:08:23.033 --> 00:08:27.467
If I plug into that formula to
get lambda max, it's going to

00:08:27.467 --> 00:08:32.333
be 2897 over 6,000.

00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:37.567
That's approximately
0.48 microns.

00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:42.400
I'll write it here as
mu m, micrometers.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:50.600
And that is going to lie right
about there, roughly in the

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:54.133
middle of the visible range
of the spectrum.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:56.333
That's kind of interesting, and
you might want to think is

00:08:56.333 --> 00:08:59.567
that just an accident?

00:08:59.567 --> 00:09:01.167
I'll say more about
that later.

00:09:01.167 --> 00:09:02.933
But make a little question
mark there.

00:09:02.933 --> 00:09:04.467
Why does it happen-- yeah?

00:09:04.467 --> 00:09:06.433
STUDENT: What is the
6,000 again?

00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:10.133
PROFESSOR: The surface
temperature of the Sun.

00:09:10.133 --> 00:09:11.267
Is it just an accident?

00:09:11.267 --> 00:09:13.267
That's my question to
you for thought.

00:09:13.267 --> 00:09:17.067
Is it just an accident that
the Sun's peak radiation

00:09:17.067 --> 00:09:23.300
happens to fall in the human
range of high sensitivity?

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.733
Interesting question.

00:09:24.733 --> 00:09:26.433
Let's do the same
thing for Earth.

00:09:29.267 --> 00:09:33.767
Typical temperature for Earth
is about 288 Kelvin.

00:09:33.767 --> 00:09:39.967
Lambda max then is
2897 over 288.

00:09:39.967 --> 00:09:40.967
That's an easy one to do.

00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:44.167
That's approximately
10 microns.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:47.433
That is way out--

00:09:47.433 --> 00:09:49.200
no, that's in the infrared.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.367
Let me not exaggerate this.

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:52.767
That is somewhere--

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:54.700
this is kind of a log
scale I've got here.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:58.100
That's in the infrared part of
the spectrum, the so-called

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.400
thermal infrared.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.133
Question?

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:01.100
STUDENT: Is that the surface
temperature?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.500
PROFESSOR: This is the surface
temperature of

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.900
the Earth, 288 Kelvin.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.067
We've used it before.

00:10:05.067 --> 00:10:06.867
It's 15 degrees Celsius--

00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:08.333
it's like the temperature
in this room.

00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:11.400
Maybe we're a few degrees warmer
than that, but this is

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.700
a typical Earth-type
temperature.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.667
So this makes a big
difference.

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:21.600
This means that the radiation
coming from the Sun is in one

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.900
wavelength.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.800
And the radiation emitted by the
Earth is quite a different

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.967
wavelength altogether.

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:28.000
So remember that.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.733
That's going to be a key
for understanding

00:10:30.733 --> 00:10:33.867
the greenhouse effect.

00:10:33.867 --> 00:10:37.733
The other law that arises
from this is called the

00:10:37.733 --> 00:10:39.000
Stefan-Boltzmann Law.

00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:54.733
And it relates to the total
power, the area under the

00:10:54.733 --> 00:11:03.300
curve, power per unit
area of an object--

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.733
an object emitting--

00:11:08.733 --> 00:11:11.467
is given by a constant--

00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:14.867
I'll use a Greek letter
sigma for that--

00:11:14.867 --> 00:11:17.567
times the temperature
to the fourth power.

00:11:17.567 --> 00:11:20.633
This constant is the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:27.167
It's derived in physics classes
from first principles.

00:11:27.167 --> 00:11:38.100
And the value is 5.735 times
10 to the minus 8 watts per

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:43.233
meter squared per Kelvins
to the fourth power.

00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:44.433
You could look it up.

00:11:44.433 --> 00:11:45.467
You can Google it.

00:11:45.467 --> 00:11:48.167
If you ever forget it, you
can find it very easily.

00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:50.367
It's a very famous physical
constant, the

00:11:50.367 --> 00:11:52.533
Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

00:11:52.533 --> 00:11:55.133
It will never be any problem
with knowing

00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:56.400
what that value is.

00:11:58.833 --> 00:12:02.233
Now before we go any further,
let's see if these two laws

00:12:02.233 --> 00:12:03.067
make any sense.

00:12:03.067 --> 00:12:06.700
The Stefan-Boltzmann law that
says that the total power goes

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:09.567
like the fourth power
of the temperature.

00:12:09.567 --> 00:12:13.533
If I were to double the
temperature, the power would

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:19.033
go up by a factor of not two,
not four, not eight, but 16.

00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:23.500
So you'd increase the power by a
factor of 16 by doubling the

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:24.700
temperature.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.633
Very powerful sensitivity
to temperature.

00:12:28.633 --> 00:12:31.133
And then Wein's law
that says that the

00:12:31.133 --> 00:12:32.900
wavelength goes inversely.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:37.033
The wavelength of maximum
radiation goes inversely with

00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:38.600
the temperature.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.433
The higher the temperature, the
shorter is the wavelength

00:12:41.433 --> 00:12:43.633
that's being strongly emitted.

00:12:43.633 --> 00:12:49.200
Now, I've got this little
light bulb over here.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.700
And I'm just going to
hit some lights.

00:12:54.533 --> 00:12:58.533
I've got a variable transformer,
and I've got a

00:12:58.533 --> 00:13:03.200
light bulb that has no frost on
the glass, so you can see

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.500
the filament in there.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.600
I can change the temperature
of the filament by how much

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.967
electrical current I
pass through it.

00:13:09.967 --> 00:13:14.400
So when, of course, it's at room
temperature like that,

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:16.767
it's radiating a little bit,
but it's radiating at

00:13:16.767 --> 00:13:19.567
wavelengths in the infrared
for which

00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:22.567
the eye is not sensitive.

00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:26.267
Then as I gradually increase the
temperature, you can begin

00:13:26.267 --> 00:13:27.500
to see it there.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:29.400
There's a little bit now in
the visible part of the

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:34.600
spectrum, but it's red.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:35.600
Remember that diagram--

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600
I should have put--

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.467
let me just back up and get
that up here for a second.

00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:47.333
On this end of the spectrum is
the red, and this is the blue.

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:51.233
So originally the wavelength
being emitted is here, now it

00:13:51.233 --> 00:13:52.433
begins to move over.

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:56.100
As I increase the temperature
you begin to see some red.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.633
Then as I continue to move it
over, at some point you'll be

00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:01.333
seeing equal amounts
in all of the--

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:06.933
in all the parts of the
visible spectrum.

00:14:06.933 --> 00:14:10.433
So there it's becoming white.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:15.167
Because that peak has moved
over, centered on the visible

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:16.333
part of the spectrum.

00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:18.167
Notice it's also very
much brighter.

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:22.933
So with this one little device,
we are looking at both

00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:25.067
the Stefan-Boltzmann
law and Wien's law.

00:14:25.067 --> 00:14:28.967
They're both illustrated by
this little experiment.

00:14:28.967 --> 00:14:31.567
Any questions on that?

00:14:31.567 --> 00:14:33.633
So all I'm doing is changing
the temperature of the

00:14:33.633 --> 00:14:37.100
filament and what I'm seeing is
an increase in power and a

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.733
shift in the wavelength from the
red into the center of the

00:14:41.733 --> 00:14:43.033
visible part of the spectrum.

00:14:45.667 --> 00:14:46.333
Yes, question.

00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:49.900
STUDENT: Why does it appear to
turn white when it does,

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.933
directly after going
to yellow?

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:55.933
PROFESSOR: Well remember,
think of this

00:14:55.933 --> 00:14:59.867
peak sliding over.

00:14:59.867 --> 00:15:03.267
So first you see only the red,
then you begin to see some red

00:15:03.267 --> 00:15:05.400
and some green is
in the middle.

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.100
That's going to give you yellow
when you get the red

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:08.233
and the green together.

00:15:08.233 --> 00:15:12.067
Then finally, when you get an
equal set of all red, green

00:15:12.067 --> 00:15:13.467
and blue, that looks white.

00:15:13.467 --> 00:15:16.567
So white light, as Newton
figured out, is the sum, an

00:15:16.567 --> 00:15:19.567
equal sum of all the visible
parts of the spectrum.

00:15:19.567 --> 00:15:22.867
So we're just seeing that happen
as we shift that peak

00:15:22.867 --> 00:15:27.633
over and center it on the
visible part of the spectrum.

00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:28.033
Yes.

00:15:28.033 --> 00:15:28.633
STUDENT: Does the
Stefan-Boltzmann Law give

00:15:28.633 --> 00:15:28.767
brightness or power?

00:15:28.767 --> 00:15:30.033
What is power?

00:15:33.067 --> 00:15:35.767
PROFESSOR: Power is the emitted
power, it's the power

00:15:35.767 --> 00:15:36.967
in that radiation.

00:15:36.967 --> 00:15:41.100
It's the rate at which energy is
being sent from the object

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:44.500
out into space with
electromagnetic radiation.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.467
You can think of as brightness
if you like, but brightness

00:15:47.467 --> 00:15:50.233
usually refers to how something
is perceived by the

00:15:50.233 --> 00:15:53.233
human eye, and that's not
our context here.

00:15:53.233 --> 00:15:55.533
Our context here is
an energy budget.

00:15:55.533 --> 00:15:58.267
How much energy is being lost.
So I'm going to use the word

00:15:58.267 --> 00:16:02.533
power there instead
of brightness.

00:16:02.533 --> 00:16:05.800
Anything else on this?

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.500
Well now I think we're
ready to do--

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:16.367
oh, well there is one other
thing maybe we should do while

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:18.633
we remember.

00:16:18.633 --> 00:16:22.000
Some of you may not even believe
me when I tell you

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.133
that all the objects in this
room are emitting.

00:16:25.133 --> 00:16:28.433
They're just not emitting
at a wavelength that the

00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:29.400
human eye can see.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.500
What do you see?

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.467
You see light reflecting
off various objects.

00:16:34.467 --> 00:16:36.467
That's not what I'm talking
about here.

00:16:36.467 --> 00:16:39.633
Objects yes, objects can reflect
light coming from

00:16:39.633 --> 00:16:41.133
light bulbs and so on.

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:44.233
But I'm talking about the
emission of radiation.

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:47.633
That's a different process
than reflection.

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:50.733
So this is just an infrared
thermometer.

00:16:50.733 --> 00:16:53.300
It's not much different than the
one you use to take your

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.300
own temperature or the
temperature of a child.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:17:00.133
It measures the temperature of
an object by measuring the

00:17:00.133 --> 00:17:03.533
intensity of the radiation
that's being emitted.

00:17:03.533 --> 00:17:05.600
So it measures emitted
radiation.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.367
Then from this curve, it
figures out what the

00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:10.533
temperature must have
been in order to

00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:13.267
radiate that intensely.

00:17:13.267 --> 00:17:16.933
So when I look at this table--

00:17:16.933 --> 00:17:18.700
by the way, I have to warn
you of something.

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.567
There is a little
laser in there.

00:17:21.567 --> 00:17:22.933
See the red dot?

00:17:22.933 --> 00:17:25.700
But that's just to
help you aim it.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:29.000
It doesn't play any role in the
measurement whatsoever.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.833
It just aims so you know
what object it is that

00:17:31.833 --> 00:17:33.167
you're aiming at.

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:35.400
But please don't aim
this in your eye.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.400
So anyway, the temperature of
this table is 24 Celsius.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.633
Temperature of my hand
is 30 Celsius.

00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:45.333
Try it yourself.

00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:46.933
I'll pass that around.

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:50.300
Anyway, that little gadget is a
perfect illustration of the

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.833
physical process I'm
talking about.

00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:57.033
It's an object emitting
radiation in proportion to its

00:17:57.033 --> 00:17:58.267
temperature--

00:17:58.267 --> 00:18:00.433
in proportion to its
temperature.

00:18:00.433 --> 00:18:05.100
Higher temperature, more
radiation is being emitted.

00:18:08.533 --> 00:18:12.400
Now I think we're ready to
do the main part of the

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.633
derivation.

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:37.767
I'm going to re-draw the Earth
here a little smaller.

00:18:37.767 --> 00:18:41.200
We're going to assume that
the Sun's radiation--

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.533
radiant beams are coming in
parallel to each other.

00:18:44.533 --> 00:18:48.800
Because the Sun is so far away
from us, we can assume that

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:51.800
those rays are actually parallel
by the time they

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:52.933
reach the Earth.

00:18:52.933 --> 00:18:56.900
Therefore, they're going to
hit the Earth and cast a

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:06.700
shadow out into outer space
behind the Earth.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:10.333
The radiation that's missing
there is going to be the

00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:13.067
radiation that hits the Earth.

00:19:13.067 --> 00:19:15.867
Now, the reason I'm saying it
that way is that you might be

00:19:15.867 --> 00:19:18.700
a little bit confused because
this Earth's surface is a

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.100
sphere, and some of the
radiation is hitting it in a

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.900
normal direction, some
of it is hitting it

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.833
in a oblique direction.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.600
For the moment, I don't
care about that.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.133
I just want to know the total
amount of radiation that hits

00:19:32.133 --> 00:19:34.567
the object independent
of where it hits and

00:19:34.567 --> 00:19:36.167
what angle it hits.

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:40.867
The easiest way to do that is
just to imagine that the Earth

00:19:40.867 --> 00:19:45.133
is casting a shadow and has
removed that amount of

00:19:45.133 --> 00:19:47.600
radiation from the beam.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:55.000
So the solar constant, the
intensity of the radiation

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.467
from the Sun at the orbital
position of the Earth is about

00:19:59.467 --> 00:20:04.400
1,380 watts per square meter.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.633
In other words, if you go
outside the atmosphere facing

00:20:07.633 --> 00:20:13.800
the Sun and draw a square meter,
there's 1,380 watts of

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.300
radiant energy passing through
that square meter.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.867
If you had two square meters, it
would be twice that value.

00:20:19.867 --> 00:20:23.733
So that's on a per
unit area basis.

00:20:23.733 --> 00:20:26.900
The area of this shadow
then is just a circle.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:33.067
It's pi r squared where r is
the radius of the planet.

00:20:36.367 --> 00:20:47.867
So the intercepted radiation is
given by the product of S

00:20:47.867 --> 00:20:49.400
pi r squared.

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.133
S is a solar constant,
pi r squared is

00:20:52.133 --> 00:20:55.667
the intercepted area.

00:20:55.667 --> 00:20:58.633
I want to illustrate
that for a second.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:00.367
I'm going to hit the
lights again here.

00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:09.400
I just have a source of light
that's nearly parallel and I

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:12.533
have my globe here.

00:21:12.533 --> 00:21:16.133
Now the Earth is spinning on
its axis of course, and its

00:21:16.133 --> 00:21:19.000
tilt may change with the
seasons, but basically it's

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.967
casting a shadow as
you see there.

00:21:21.967 --> 00:21:27.433
That shadow is just related to
the projected area of this

00:21:27.433 --> 00:21:30.800
sphere, which is pi r squared,
the area of a circle.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.867
So that's all I've done here is
just to compute the total

00:21:33.867 --> 00:21:36.567
radiation hitting that globe
by using the idea

00:21:36.567 --> 00:21:39.933
of casting a shadow.

00:21:39.933 --> 00:21:43.233
Questions on that?

00:21:43.233 --> 00:21:46.700
Pretty simple idea.

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:51.667
Now, some of that radiation,
however,

00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:52.933
is going to be reflected.

00:21:56.967 --> 00:22:02.067
And we define here something
called the albedo.

00:22:02.067 --> 00:22:04.933
Albedo is the average
reflectivity of a planet.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.367
It can be expressed as a decimal
or as a percent.

00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:26.367
I'll give you a number
for Earth.

00:22:26.367 --> 00:22:31.933
For planet Earth the albedo is
approximately 0.33, or you

00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:33.500
could call that 33%.

00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:37.400
Approximately 33% of the
radiation that hits the Earth

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.567
reflects off.

00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:42.000
And because that heat then
doesn't really enter the

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.800
Earth, doesn't really add energy
to the Earth, we're

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:47.700
going to drop that off.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.133
So that was the intercepted
radiation.

00:22:51.133 --> 00:23:08.000
The absorbed radiation then is
S pi r squared times 1 minus

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.267
the albedo.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.600
If 33% is reflected, well
then, 67% is absorbed.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.867
That's the 1 minus the albedo.

00:23:20.867 --> 00:23:22.100
It's the other part.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:30.167
The amount reflected is S pi
r squared A, and the part

00:23:30.167 --> 00:23:34.133
absorbed is S pi r squared
1 minus A. So we've just

00:23:34.133 --> 00:23:40.333
partitioned that radiation, the
part that is absorbed and

00:23:40.333 --> 00:23:43.400
the part that is reflected.

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.700
Now, let's try to compute what
the emitted radiation is.

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.900
We're going to assume that the
surface of the earth is a

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.000
black body.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.167
It emits according to the
Stefan-Boltzmann law.

00:24:02.167 --> 00:24:05.067
So we have to get the area--

00:24:05.067 --> 00:24:07.033
remember, this is
per unit area--

00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:10.933
we need to find the area
that is emitting.

00:24:10.933 --> 00:24:14.767
The area that is emitting
is not the

00:24:14.767 --> 00:24:16.900
projected area of the sphere.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:21.033
It's the actual area
of a sphere.

00:24:21.033 --> 00:24:25.633
What is the expression for the
surface area of a sphere?

00:24:25.633 --> 00:24:27.233
Anybody remember?

00:24:27.233 --> 00:24:28.500
STUDENT: 4 pi r squared.

00:24:31.533 --> 00:24:33.367
PROFESSOR: 4 pi r
squared, right.

00:24:33.367 --> 00:24:41.833
So the area we're talking about
here is 4 pi r squared,

00:24:41.833 --> 00:24:46.967
and so the emitted radiation
then is going to be 4 pi r

00:24:46.967 --> 00:24:53.033
squared times sigma times T
to the fourth using the

00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:54.300
Stefan-Boltzmann law.

00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:03.100
Questions so far?

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:03.600
Yes.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.300
STUDENT: For the surface area
thing, we're including the

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.167
entire Earth, even though
the Sun's only

00:25:09.167 --> 00:25:10.233
shining on half of it?

00:25:10.233 --> 00:25:11.267
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:25:11.267 --> 00:25:11.667
That's right.

00:25:11.667 --> 00:25:15.533
Remember, I've assumed here that
the Earth has a uniform

00:25:15.533 --> 00:25:19.100
temperature, and since the
emission depends only on the

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.300
temperature, we're going
to use the entire

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:25.533
surface of the Earth.

00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:29.700
After all, even in the real
world, when expressed in

00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:33.967
Kelvins, that temperature
is not so different.

00:25:33.967 --> 00:25:40.667
This might be 310 Kelvin, this
might be 250 Kelvin, but out

00:25:40.667 --> 00:25:43.367
of a range of 300, so that's
not a huge difference.

00:25:43.367 --> 00:25:45.233
So this is not a huge problem.

00:25:45.233 --> 00:25:47.933
It's not great, but it's not a
huge problem, the assumption

00:25:47.933 --> 00:25:51.000
of uniform temperature.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.533
Well, I think you know what I'm
going to do now because of

00:25:53.533 --> 00:25:57.400
what I did in the
tank experiment.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:03.667
I have laws that govern the
input and the output, and I'm

00:26:03.667 --> 00:26:06.433
going to assume steady state and
see what kind of a-- how

00:26:06.433 --> 00:26:09.067
does a system come
into equilibrium?

00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:11.567
So I'm making the steady
state assumption.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:21.400
Simply, all I have to do is
balance the emitted radiation,

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:30.900
which has units, by the way, of
watts with the intercepted

00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:36.000
or the absorbed radiation,
which has units of watts.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.567
So I will simply equate
those two.

00:26:37.567 --> 00:26:42.300
I'm going to write S pi r
squared 1 minus the albedo is

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:47.200
now equal to, this is the
statement of steady state, 4

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:53.800
pi r squared sigma
T to the fourth.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:57.333
That's the profound and
very useful step.

00:27:01.933 --> 00:27:05.533
And I could then go the next
step and solve mathematically

00:27:05.533 --> 00:27:07.100
for the temperature
of the planet.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.967
So let me do that.

00:27:08.967 --> 00:27:12.200
First of all, notice that the
pi r squares are going to

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.000
cancel out from both sides
of the equation.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.500
In other words, the result is
not going to depend on the

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.767
radius of the planet.

00:27:20.767 --> 00:27:21.400
Why is that?

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:25.700
Well, the larger the planet
is, the more radiation it

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:29.333
receives from the Sun, but
the more effectively

00:27:29.333 --> 00:27:31.467
it radiates to space.

00:27:31.467 --> 00:27:34.233
And those two things
exactly cancel out.

00:27:34.233 --> 00:27:38.900
So there's no direct impact
of the size of the planet.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:42.167
Notice that four remains,
however.

00:27:42.167 --> 00:27:44.833
That important difference
between the projected area of

00:27:44.833 --> 00:27:48.867
a sphere and the surface area
of the sphere, that stays in

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:50.133
our calculation.

00:27:52.133 --> 00:27:55.333
Now let me bring T to the
fourth over here on the

00:27:55.333 --> 00:27:56.133
left-hand side.

00:27:56.133 --> 00:28:03.733
That's going to be S times 1
minus albedo over 4 sigma.

00:28:03.733 --> 00:28:06.367
Have I done that right?

00:28:06.367 --> 00:28:08.800
Divide through by 4 sigma.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.500
Then the final step would be
to take the fourth root of

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.233
that equation.

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:18.300
So I'm going to write it as T
equals bracket 1 minus the

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:24.000
albedo over 4 sigma
to the 1/4 power.

00:28:28.433 --> 00:28:33.333
That is a prediction based on
some simple laws of physics

00:28:33.333 --> 00:28:37.200
for how hot each temperature in
the solar-- each planet in

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.467
the solar system will be.

00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:44.267
You need to know the solar
constant for that planet, and

00:28:44.267 --> 00:28:47.467
of course, the further away
from the Sun you are, the

00:28:47.467 --> 00:28:50.100
smaller will be that value.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:54.067
You need to know the albedo of
the planet, how much radiation

00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:56.633
does it reflect.

00:28:56.633 --> 00:28:59.367
And then you need to know the
Stefan-Boltzmann constant, but

00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:02.767
that's a universal constant so
that doesn't change from

00:29:02.767 --> 00:29:05.400
planet to planet.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.433
STUDENT: And the sigma is
the Stefan-Boltzmann--

00:29:10.967 --> 00:29:12.733
PROFESSOR: So let's put some
numbers in here for Earth.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.300
What am I using for
solar constant?

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:24.667
1,380.

00:29:24.667 --> 00:29:42.867
The albedo for Earth is 0.33.

00:29:42.867 --> 00:29:44.300
This is a formula for which
you're going to want

00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:46.100
to check the units.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.267
I haven't put the units up here,
but you should do that

00:29:48.267 --> 00:29:50.367
to be sure all the units
are going to work out.

00:29:50.367 --> 00:29:52.233
That should be just
in Kelvins.

00:29:52.233 --> 00:29:57.500
So when you do all the unit
crossings out, you should get

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.000
something just in
units of Kelvin.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.967
Leave an inch in your notes
to check on that.

00:30:03.967 --> 00:30:11.400
I worked this out and that's
about 252 Kelvins, predicted

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:13.033
temperature for Earth.

00:30:16.233 --> 00:30:18.567
Questions on that calculation?

00:30:18.567 --> 00:30:22.800
Remember all the assumptions
that went into it.

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:25.800
These, as well as assuming that
the Earth emits like a

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.900
black body, because
we used that.

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:40.867
Now, if you convert that to
Celsius, that's minus 21

00:30:40.867 --> 00:30:44.067
degrees Celsius.

00:30:44.067 --> 00:30:46.167
That's a little too
cold, right?

00:30:46.167 --> 00:30:51.033
Remember, the actual temperature
for Earth is

00:30:51.033 --> 00:30:55.500
something around 288
Kelvin, which is

00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:01.400
about 15 degrees Celsius.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:06.867
Now if you look at this in the
Celsius-- in the Kelvin scale,

00:31:06.867 --> 00:31:13.700
252 versus 288, that seems like
a pretty good estimate.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:18.133
It's only off by 10% or 15%,
something like that.

00:31:18.133 --> 00:31:22.167
But if you look at it in terms
of Celsius, it looks like a

00:31:22.167 --> 00:31:25.400
bad approximation.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:26.067
Why is that?

00:31:26.067 --> 00:31:28.400
Because remember, the
Celsius scale--

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.000
zero on the Celsius scale
is based at the

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.367
freezing point for water.

00:31:34.367 --> 00:31:38.400
Whether water is frozen or not
is a big deal for us on Earth.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:44.067
So this prediction with the
assumptions I made indicates

00:31:44.067 --> 00:31:46.767
the earth would be in a
permanently frozen state.

00:31:46.767 --> 00:31:49.867
All the water on it would be
frozen, whereas this would say

00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:51.800
most of the water's going to
be in the liquid state.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.067
So it's a big deal to think of
it in terms of Celsius or in

00:31:55.067 --> 00:31:59.000
terms of water, but it's not
such a bad approximation if

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.700
you think of it in terms of
absolute temperature.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.033
Now what do you think is the
reason for the error?

00:32:05.033 --> 00:32:08.267
Where have I gone wrong
with this calculation?

00:32:08.267 --> 00:32:09.533
Anybody in the back?

00:32:11.967 --> 00:32:12.467
Yeah.

00:32:12.467 --> 00:32:13.700
STUDENT: You're assuming
no geothermal heat?

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:16.933
PROFESSOR: No.

00:32:16.933 --> 00:32:20.733
I did make that assumption, but
it turns out that that's a

00:32:20.733 --> 00:32:21.900
very good assumption.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.400
So that's not the problem.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:23.833
Yes.

00:32:23.833 --> 00:32:25.100
STUDENT: Are you assuming that
it's like a black body?

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.567
What's the catch word there?

00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:34.000
So yeah, the greenhouse
effect.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.967
So the planet has
an atmosphere.

00:32:35.967 --> 00:32:38.767
I've neglected the
atmosphere here.

00:32:38.767 --> 00:32:43.067
What the atmosphere does on our
planet and others is that

00:32:43.067 --> 00:32:46.533
when the radiation is emitted
from the Earth's surface,

00:32:46.533 --> 00:32:50.233
instead of letting all of that
escape, it stops some of it,

00:32:50.233 --> 00:32:55.000
it absorbs it, and sends some
of it back to Earth again.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.767
It's as if that object is not
able to radiate with its full

00:32:59.767 --> 00:33:01.800
black body potential.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.100
Something's holding that heat
in, and it's the greenhouse

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.133
gases in the atmosphere.

00:33:08.133 --> 00:33:11.033
So obviously, we're going to
be coming back to this time

00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:12.133
and time again in the course.

00:33:12.133 --> 00:33:17.600
But this important discrepancy
is largely due to our neglect

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:21.500
of the atmosphere, that is
to say our neglect of the

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.767
greenhouse effect.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.067
Let me give a very brief
description of how the

00:33:34.067 --> 00:33:38.167
greenhouse effect works
on planet Earth.

00:33:38.167 --> 00:33:40.967
And then we'll take a quick look
at some other planets to

00:33:40.967 --> 00:33:44.267
see if other planets have a
greenhouse effect as well.

00:33:51.567 --> 00:33:56.567
So once again, this is
wavelength versus intensity of

00:33:56.567 --> 00:33:58.533
radiation emitted.

00:34:04.133 --> 00:34:10.933
For Earth's temperature,
the curve looks

00:34:10.933 --> 00:34:12.600
something like that.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:19.200
For the Sun's temperature it
looks something like that.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.967
We've already talked about this
shift in the wavelength

00:34:22.967 --> 00:34:25.133
of maximum emission.

00:34:25.133 --> 00:34:27.567
But let me put underneath this
some of the absorptive

00:34:27.567 --> 00:34:31.633
properties of the Earth's
atmosphere.

00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:37.500
On the same wavelength scale,
I'm going to draw here the

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:45.267
percent absorbed as radiation
tries to pass through the

00:34:45.267 --> 00:34:45.900
atmosphere.

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:49.133
In other words, I'm looking at
a segment of the atmosphere

00:34:49.133 --> 00:34:52.933
and imagining radiation is
either coming in and trying to

00:34:52.933 --> 00:34:55.867
penetrate to the Earth's
surface, or it's trying to get

00:34:55.867 --> 00:34:56.900
out and escape.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:34:58.967
Either one, it doesn't matter
what direction it's moving,

00:34:58.967 --> 00:35:01.200
but some fraction of the
radiation's going to be

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.000
absorbed as it tries to pass
through the atmosphere.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.300
That's the faction I'm going
to plot on the y-axis here.

00:35:12.167 --> 00:35:15.600
Now, the visible part of the
spectrum is about here.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.367
Let's call that the
visible part.

00:35:18.367 --> 00:35:19.767
I'm going to need
these guidelines

00:35:19.767 --> 00:35:22.933
to help me be accurate.

00:35:22.933 --> 00:35:25.467
Here's 100%.

00:35:25.467 --> 00:35:27.233
Basically, this absorption
curve looks

00:35:27.233 --> 00:35:28.467
something like this.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:36.967
I'm just making some random
wiggles here.

00:35:36.967 --> 00:35:40.167
There are a few areas that are
nearly transparent in the

00:35:40.167 --> 00:35:41.400
wavelength spectrum.

00:35:44.033 --> 00:35:46.567
And then you get to the radio
waves and it comes way down.

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.600
So this is very schematic.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:53.933
I haven't meant to be
quantitative on this.

00:35:53.933 --> 00:35:59.533
The point is that most of the
Sun's radiation falls in a

00:35:59.533 --> 00:36:03.500
part of the spectrum for which
the Earth's atmosphere is

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.867
transparent.

00:36:04.867 --> 00:36:07.867
When this percent absorption
is low, that means the

00:36:07.867 --> 00:36:09.133
atmosphere is transparent.

00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:15.700
On the other hand, when the
Earth tries to radiate back

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:21.033
out to space, because it's
cooler, it radiates at a

00:36:21.033 --> 00:36:24.067
longer wavelength.

00:36:24.067 --> 00:36:27.167
That wavelength tends to fall
in a region where there's a

00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:30.167
lot of atmospheric absorption.

00:36:30.167 --> 00:36:35.400
The atmosphere is almost
opaque at those longer

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.000
wavelengths.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.267
So it's a bit like
a one-way valve.

00:36:41.267 --> 00:36:43.167
I don't like that analogy,
but let me say it and

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:44.833
then correct it.

00:36:44.833 --> 00:36:46.500
It's really like a
one-way valve.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.733
The radiation coming from the
Sun can pass through the

00:36:49.733 --> 00:36:52.700
atmosphere and heat the Earth.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.933
Now I'm neglecting the little
bit that's ultraviolet that

00:36:56.933 --> 00:37:00.067
heats the stratosphere, a little
bit of the X-rays that

00:37:00.067 --> 00:37:00.967
heats the thermosphere.

00:37:00.967 --> 00:37:03.633
The bulk of the radiation comes
right on through and

00:37:03.633 --> 00:37:05.067
hits the surface of the Earth.

00:37:05.067 --> 00:37:09.000
But when the Earth tries to
radiate out to space, most of

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.500
that radiation is absorbed and
it has to be re-emitted before

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:15.933
it can finally escape
from the planet.

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:19.433
Now, I don't like the term
one-way valve because that

00:37:19.433 --> 00:37:22.833
implies that it makes a
difference what direction the

00:37:22.833 --> 00:37:27.000
radiation is moving in, and
that's not the point at all.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.433
The point is that these are at
two different wavelengths.

00:37:31.433 --> 00:37:34.167
Absorption doesn't depend on
what direction the photons are

00:37:34.167 --> 00:37:36.367
moving, but it does depend
on their wavelength.

00:37:36.367 --> 00:37:39.533
So the short wavelength can
penetrate, the longer

00:37:39.533 --> 00:37:42.033
wavelengths cannot.

00:37:42.033 --> 00:37:45.333
And that's the origin, or that's
the physics behind the

00:37:45.333 --> 00:37:46.067
greenhouse effect.

00:37:46.067 --> 00:37:46.400
Yes.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.633
STUDENT: Does it enter the
atmosphere and then--?

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.867
PROFESSOR: Enter and
penetrate through.

00:37:52.867 --> 00:37:53.567
When I say penetrate--

00:37:53.567 --> 00:37:55.267
STUDENT: And hit the surface?

00:37:55.267 --> 00:37:55.700
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.900
So this radiation will come
through all the way to the

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:58.567
Earth's surface.

00:37:58.567 --> 00:38:00.800
There it will be absorbed.

00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:02.967
It'll heat the Earth's surface
and then that heat will come

00:38:02.967 --> 00:38:05.167
back up and heat the atmosphere
and so on.

00:38:05.167 --> 00:38:08.533
But the point is it gets all the
way through the atmosphere

00:38:08.533 --> 00:38:09.667
without being absorbed.

00:38:09.667 --> 00:38:11.800
It isn't until it hits
the Earth's surface

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800
that it gets absorbed.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.100
Thanks for that clarification.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.533
This is the atmosphere only
I'm talking about.

00:38:16.533 --> 00:38:20.300
All those radiations,
of course, cannot

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.467
penetrate into the Earth.

00:38:21.467 --> 00:38:23.133
They're absorbed immediately
when they

00:38:23.133 --> 00:38:23.933
hit the Earth's surface.

00:38:23.933 --> 00:38:24.233
Yes.

00:38:24.233 --> 00:38:25.467
STUDENT: So you're saying that
the longer wavelengths--?

00:38:30.867 --> 00:38:32.900
PROFESSOR: Cannot penetrate
through the atmosphere.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.700
STUDENT: So they don't go
through-- do they get into the

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:36.367
atmosphere?

00:38:36.367 --> 00:38:36.967
PROFESSOR: They do.

00:38:36.967 --> 00:38:38.367
They get part way--

00:38:38.367 --> 00:38:40.867
for example, this happens to
be radiation trying to get

00:38:40.867 --> 00:38:42.633
out, because it's the
longer stuff.

00:38:42.633 --> 00:38:45.600
So let's just imagine for a
moment, you've got the Earth's

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:49.300
surface radiating at,
say, 10 microns,

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:51.133
wavelength of 10 microns.

00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:53.867
It'll penetrate up a few hundred
meters or maybe even a

00:38:53.867 --> 00:38:57.600
kilometer into the atmosphere,
but it'll get absorbed.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.233
It'll heat the air there, the
air will then re-radiate some

00:39:01.233 --> 00:39:03.000
up and some down.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.800
And some of the down will come
all the way back and add a

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.167
source of heat to the surface.

00:39:08.167 --> 00:39:09.467
So the fact that--

00:39:09.467 --> 00:39:12.000
I'm not saying it can't
penetrate a little bit.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.667
It'll penetrate on average tens,
hundreds, maybe even a

00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:19.433
few thousand meters, but it
won't get all the way out for

00:39:19.433 --> 00:39:20.667
the most part.

00:39:20.667 --> 00:39:22.767
That's not 100%.

00:39:22.767 --> 00:39:25.533
Some will get out, but
most will not.

00:39:25.533 --> 00:39:30.800
There are few special parts
of the spectrum that are

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:36.200
transparent, even to these
longer waves, and we refer to

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:39.100
those as windows.

00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.100
For example, the most famous
one, the so-called infrared

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.967
window is from 8
to 12 microns.

00:39:45.967 --> 00:39:47.167
It's a fairly narrow window.

00:39:47.167 --> 00:39:49.800
It's only 4 microns in width.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.133
And out there that's
not very much.

00:39:52.133 --> 00:39:55.400
But there, that particular
wavelength

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.567
can penetrate through.

00:39:56.567 --> 00:40:00.500
And this gadget, by the
way, you might ask

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:01.700
why does this work?

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.533
If there's such a thing as
atmospheric absorption, then

00:40:04.533 --> 00:40:07.800
how come the radiation emitted
from the surface hasn't been

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.967
absorbed before it gets
to the instrument?

00:40:09.967 --> 00:40:12.267
This instrument is designed
to work in

00:40:12.267 --> 00:40:14.400
that particular window.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:17.667
But it's a narrow window, and I
had to use special optics to

00:40:17.667 --> 00:40:20.900
get it just to work
in that window.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.200
So be careful, the atmosphere
is not opaque to every

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.267
wavelength, but to most
wavelengths out in the

00:40:28.267 --> 00:40:30.300
infrared part of the spectrum.

00:40:35.233 --> 00:40:36.500
Any questions there?

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:42.600
I think I have time to
put up a small table.

00:40:50.133 --> 00:40:54.033
I'm going to keep this final
formula here because that's

00:40:54.033 --> 00:40:56.067
the one that I used to
construct the table.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:14.100
Planet, albedo, predicted
temperature, and the actual

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:19.533
temperature, and something
about the

00:41:19.533 --> 00:41:24.233
atmosphere of the planet.

00:41:24.233 --> 00:41:30.133
Venus, Earth, and Mars.

00:41:30.133 --> 00:41:32.067
We'll just do those three
Earth-like planets.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:46.300
The albedo for these planets
are 0.71, 0.33, and 0.17.

00:41:46.300 --> 00:41:50.933
Venus is a very bright planet,
if you look at in the sky.

00:41:50.933 --> 00:41:53.233
It's very often the brightest
object in the sky because it

00:41:53.233 --> 00:41:56.167
reflects radiation
so strongly.

00:41:56.167 --> 00:42:01.000
We see that represented by that
high albedo number there.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.800
The Earth we've already
spoken about.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.467
Some of that reflectivity comes
from the clouds in our

00:42:07.467 --> 00:42:10.100
atmosphere, which are
quite bright.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:15.167
Mars is a rather dark planet,
Mars with an s, because there

00:42:15.167 --> 00:42:17.000
are very few clouds
in its atmosphere.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.500
So it's only the surface itself
that we're dealing with

00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.767
when we're computing
the albedo.

00:42:24.567 --> 00:42:24.867
When I put the--

00:42:24.867 --> 00:42:26.033
I haven't written the
solar constant.

00:42:26.033 --> 00:42:28.567
Remember, S is different for
each of these planets as well,

00:42:28.567 --> 00:42:31.600
but when I put the appropriate
S in there and use that

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.567
albedo, here's what I get
from this formula.

00:42:35.567 --> 00:42:40.200
I get 244, 252--

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.867
we've done that one--

00:42:41.867 --> 00:42:46.233
and 216.

00:42:46.233 --> 00:42:47.500
And here's the actual.

00:42:55.767 --> 00:42:59.667
The actual observed surface
temperature for these planets.

00:42:59.667 --> 00:43:00.733
Mars is pretty good.

00:43:00.733 --> 00:43:05.567
We predict 216, the
actual is 230.

00:43:05.567 --> 00:43:08.533
There is a little bit of a
greenhouse effect on Mars, but

00:43:08.533 --> 00:43:10.267
it's not terribly strong.

00:43:10.267 --> 00:43:12.133
The Earth we've already
spoken about.

00:43:12.133 --> 00:43:15.167
That's a pretty big difference
when you express it in Celsius

00:43:15.167 --> 00:43:16.867
and think about the properties
of water.

00:43:16.867 --> 00:43:19.433
But look at Venus.

00:43:19.433 --> 00:43:20.533
We are not even close.

00:43:20.533 --> 00:43:22.467
Not even in a Kelvin scale
does that look like a

00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:24.633
reasonable estimate.

00:43:24.633 --> 00:43:27.067
That's because Venus has
the granddaddy of

00:43:27.067 --> 00:43:29.667
all greenhouse effects.

00:43:29.667 --> 00:43:33.333
That huge difference is due
to the effect of Venus's

00:43:33.333 --> 00:43:37.333
atmosphere trapping infrared
radiation as it tries to leave

00:43:37.333 --> 00:43:38.400
the surface.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:44.033
Let me just mention here,
Venus has a massive CO2

00:43:44.033 --> 00:43:46.733
atmosphere.

00:43:46.733 --> 00:43:52.733
Earth has a moderate intensity,
mostly air, but

00:43:52.733 --> 00:43:59.500
with some greenhouse gases
like H20, CO2, et cetera.

00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:01.400
I have to erase this now.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:08.267
And Mars has a thin
CO2 atmosphere.

00:44:08.267 --> 00:44:13.800
CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but
because the atmosphere of Mars

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.133
is so thin, the greenhouse
effect is not particularly

00:44:17.133 --> 00:44:19.800
strong on Mars.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.867
So there we have it.

00:44:21.867 --> 00:44:26.433
We have the fact that the
greenhouse effect is-- occurs

00:44:26.433 --> 00:44:29.800
on all planets that
have atmospheres.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.833
It tends to make the planet's
surface temperature warmer

00:44:33.833 --> 00:44:36.233
than it would otherwise be.

00:44:36.233 --> 00:44:40.700
The physics of it has to do with
radiation being able to

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:44.233
penetrate through
the atmosphere.

00:44:44.233 --> 00:44:47.833
The Sun's radiation versus the
radiation that's emitted by

00:44:47.833 --> 00:44:49.533
the planet.

00:44:49.533 --> 00:44:53.800
Then it depends on the nature of
the atmosphere how much of

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:58.833
a greenhouse gas you're
going to have. CO2's

00:44:58.833 --> 00:45:00.133
a greenhouse gas.

00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:07.000
The surface pressure on Venus
is something like 60 times

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.567
that of Earth.

00:45:08.567 --> 00:45:11.933
Has a very massive atmosphere,
and it's almost all CO2.

00:45:11.933 --> 00:45:14.300
You can just imagine
you're going to--

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:19.567
kind of like the worst possible
scenario for having a

00:45:19.567 --> 00:45:20.900
very strong greenhouse gas.

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.133
Not only is there a lot of it,
but almost all of it is an

00:45:24.133 --> 00:45:25.233
absorbing gas.

00:45:25.233 --> 00:45:26.900
I have to say a few words--

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.167
I think I can squeeze it in--

00:45:29.167 --> 00:45:32.633
about what is a greenhouse gas
because I use that term

00:45:32.633 --> 00:45:33.933
loosely now.

00:45:33.933 --> 00:45:35.200
It needs to be defined.

00:45:43.867 --> 00:45:51.600
It's basically a gas
that can absorb and

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:58.833
emit infrared radiation.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.467
What determines whether
a gas can do that is

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:13.333
its molecular structure.

00:46:13.333 --> 00:46:20.133
So for example, an Argon atom
just by itself, because it's

00:46:20.133 --> 00:46:24.867
only a single point mass, it
cannot rotate, it can't

00:46:24.867 --> 00:46:27.367
vibrate, it can just
move around.

00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:32.967
And by moving around, it doesn't
radiate any energy.

00:46:32.967 --> 00:46:42.033
Nitrogen, N2, two point masses
held by a chemical bond.

00:46:42.033 --> 00:46:46.867
It can rotate, it can vibrate,
but because it's a symmetric

00:46:46.867 --> 00:46:52.700
molecule, it's electrical
charge distribution is

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:56.733
symmetric and it has
no dipole moment.

00:46:59.633 --> 00:47:05.200
A dipole moment is a separation
of charges.

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.600
If I've got a positive and a
negative charge and they've

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:12.700
been moved apart, then
we say that object

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.800
has a dipole moment.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:20.133
But you need to break symmetry
in the molecule before you can

00:47:20.133 --> 00:47:22.600
have a dipole moment, and
nitrogen is a perfectly

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.900
symmetric molecule.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:29.467
Nitrogen, nitrogen, symmetry,
no dipole moment.

00:47:29.467 --> 00:47:32.800
Oxygen, same problem, right?

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:36.433
Perfectly symmetric molecule,
no dipole moment.

00:47:36.433 --> 00:47:37.600
Look at this.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:41.167
The primary constituents of
our atmosphere, nitrogen

00:47:41.167 --> 00:47:45.700
first, oxygen second, Argon
third, none of them have a

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.000
dipole moment, none of
them can absorb or

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.333
emit infrared radiation.

00:47:49.333 --> 00:47:51.167
These are not greenhouse
gases.

00:47:51.167 --> 00:47:55.333
It doesn't matter much how much
of these you have. What

00:47:55.333 --> 00:47:56.667
are the greenhouse gases then?

00:47:56.667 --> 00:48:02.900
Well CO2, which has a
structure like this.

00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:04.767
That's a greenhouse gas.

00:48:04.767 --> 00:48:05.400
Why, do you say?

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.100
It looks symmetric,
doesn't it?

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:10.267
But it can vibrate.

00:48:10.267 --> 00:48:14.033
If that carbon vibrates to the
left and that oxygen vibrates

00:48:14.033 --> 00:48:17.567
to the right, suddenly
I've broken symmetry.

00:48:17.567 --> 00:48:20.900
And I can have a dipole moment,
and that will absorb

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.433
and emit infrared radiation.

00:48:22.433 --> 00:48:24.033
What about water vapor?

00:48:24.033 --> 00:48:26.200
H2O.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.100
Oxygen, two hydrogens.

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.333
Well, that's symmetric,
isn't it?

00:48:31.333 --> 00:48:34.633
Well no, not about that axis.

00:48:34.633 --> 00:48:36.133
It's not symmetric
about that axis.

00:48:36.133 --> 00:48:38.533
So it'll have a dipole moment.

00:48:38.533 --> 00:48:41.600
And it will absorb and
emit radiation.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.100
So see, the distinction I want
to make here is between gases

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:49.067
that are so simple in their
structure that they can never,

00:48:49.067 --> 00:48:51.667
no matter what they do, they
can't generate a dipole

00:48:51.667 --> 00:48:54.733
moment, they can't get
a charge separation.

00:48:54.733 --> 00:48:57.167
Remember, when you're talking
on your cell phone, you're

00:48:57.167 --> 00:48:58.733
transmitting radiation.

00:48:58.733 --> 00:49:01.833
There's an antenna in there
that's creating a dipole

00:49:01.833 --> 00:49:04.267
moment-- positive, negative,
positive, negative, positive,

00:49:04.267 --> 00:49:08.033
negative, and that is what is
emitting the radiation.

00:49:08.033 --> 00:49:10.200
When you're listening, the
same thing is happening.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.867
That radiation is
coming to you.

00:49:11.867 --> 00:49:15.867
It's being captured by the
antenna in the cell phone with

00:49:15.867 --> 00:49:17.933
a dipole moment.

00:49:17.933 --> 00:49:19.900
So it's exactly the
same physics.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:23.100
In all cases, you have to have
an oscillating dipole moment

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.733
if you want to absorb
or emit radiation.

00:49:26.733 --> 00:49:32.567
Air cannot do it, but these
greenhouse gases can.

00:49:32.567 --> 00:49:34.133
We're out of time, but
we'll pick up on

00:49:34.133 --> 00:49:36.133
the theme next meeting.

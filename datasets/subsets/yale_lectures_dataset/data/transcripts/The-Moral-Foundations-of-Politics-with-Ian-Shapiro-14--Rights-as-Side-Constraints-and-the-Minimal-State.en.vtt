00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.701
Prof: So you'll recall
from our discussion on Monday we

00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:13.531
were working our way through
Nozick's hypothetical social

00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.170
contract story.
 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.848
The thought experiment he asks
us to engage in as a way of

00:00:20.848 --> 00:00:26.129
thinking about the social
contract idea as a basis for

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:28.620
political legitimacy.
 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.549
And he asks us,
in effect, to suspend disbelief

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:38.020
and work through this story with
him holding out the promise that

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.720
he's going to show how the state
can be legitimate.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.298
And so he said,
"Imagine a hypothetical

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:49.809
state of nature,
not consisting of pre-political

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.420
people,
but of people like you and me

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.956
in a condition where there was
no government,"

00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:59.421
and we would find that to be
very inconvenient and

00:00:59.421 --> 00:01:02.250
inefficient because as Locke
said,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.891
every single person would have
to be an enforcer of the law of

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:06.430
nature.
 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.400
Everybody would have to look
after their own property.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.750
It would be highly inefficient.
 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.908
That, in turn,
would lead to the creation of

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:17.259
kind of block watch
associations,

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.830
mutual protective associations.
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.120
They would also,
though, not be particularly

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.790
efficient because we all know
from reading Adam Smith that the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.688
thing that really increases
efficiency is division of labor.

00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:38.013
And so some people would go
into the protection business and

00:01:38.013 --> 00:01:43.474
sell protection full time,
but because coercive force is a

00:01:43.474 --> 00:01:48.459
natural monopoly,
and we know from the discussion

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:54.415
last time Nozick agrees with
Glenn Beck that it's the only

00:01:54.415 --> 00:01:59.224
natural monopoly,
eventually one of these groups

00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:01.230
would become dominant.
 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.165
And that he calls the--one of
his slogans is,

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:09.189
that's the "ultra-minimal
state."

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:11.460
Now I will just pause here.
 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.327
You might say, "Hmm,
well if that was true,

00:02:17.327 --> 00:02:24.806
if coercive force is a natural
monopoly why don't we have a

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:28.158
world government?"
 

00:02:28.158 --> 00:02:33.442
I mean, if we went from
militias to nations,

00:02:33.442 --> 00:02:39.340
why aren't nations just
militias in the world?

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.610
It stands to reason, right?
 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.590
It's just the same thing on a
bigger scale.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.878
Does anyone wonder what Nozick
might say?

00:02:46.878 --> 00:02:58.090
Anyone got any idea what Nozick
might say in response to that?

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.949
Otherwise it doesn't seem very
plausible.

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:06.610
Either coercive force is a
natural monopoly or it isn't.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.759
No?
 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.650
Am I missing something here?
 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.610
What might Nozick say?
 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:12.830
He doesn't confront this.
 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.674
It's not anywhere in the book,
but it seems like a natural

00:03:18.674 --> 00:03:20.930
question to ask,
no?

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.250
No?
 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.979
Anyone want to try this?
 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.169
Yeah?
 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:33.299
Student:  He might argue
that because of kind of natural

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.895
boundaries or even artificial
boundaries that have been

00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:41.360
created that the two protection
agencies are sort of separated.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.940
Prof: Yeah, brilliant.
 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.970
I think you hit the nail on the
head.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.722
I think he would say it's
conditioned by available

00:03:47.722 --> 00:03:49.560
technologies of force.
 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.639
So if it becomes possible to
project force all over the world

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:03.009
then we might get to the
situation where we will have a

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:09.854
world government that indeed
countries are just like bigger

00:04:09.854 --> 00:04:13.628
militias within a country.
 

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:18.656
And if there were the available
coercive force to create a world

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:21.129
government, it would be done.
 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:25.033
The famous pacifist
philosopher, Bertrand Russell,

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:28.139
had a kind of Nozickian view of
this.

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:30.889
He had opposed World War II.
 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.839
He had opposed the creation of
nuclear weapons,

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:40.540
but as soon as we dropped the
bomb on Hiroshima in 1947,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.805
Russell came out and said,
"America should

00:04:42.805 --> 00:04:45.120
immediately declare a world
government."

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.632
So he was Nozickian in his
thinking, but what he lacked was

00:04:49.632 --> 00:04:52.589
the knowledge of a social
scientist.

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:55.730
He bought the clear-headedness
of a philosopher,

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.387
but it wasn't constrained by
the knowledge of a social

00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:03.535
scientist,
because the mere fact that you

00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:07.747
have the capacity to destroy the
world doesn't mean you have the

00:05:07.747 --> 00:05:10.889
capacity to enforce obedience on
the ground.

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.889
This is a lesson we learned in
Iraq after 2003.

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.870
Yes, we could obliterate the
Iraqi Army,

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.202
but that's something quite
different from actually being

00:05:21.202 --> 00:05:24.899
able to enforce the rule of law
within Iraq on the ground,

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:25.509
right?
 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:28.459
And it turns out,
we'll go into this in more

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:33.250
detail a bit later,
but although there is one

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:41.649
respect in which coercive force
is a natural monopoly in that,

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:48.928
for it to be a good,
it has to be enforced over a

00:05:48.928 --> 00:05:53.850
given territory,
otherwise you just have the

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:57.779
sort of situations we were
talking about on Monday.

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.271
Nonetheless,
there are various economies of

00:06:01.271 --> 00:06:05.509
smallness in enforcement,
and the community policing

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.500
literature discovered this in
urban context.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.430
So it's not as simple as it
looks,

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.257
but I think just from the point
of view of what we need to

00:06:15.257 --> 00:06:19.487
complete the thought experiment
here is that Nozick would indeed

00:06:19.487 --> 00:06:23.112
say that the reason we don't
have a world government is

00:06:23.112 --> 00:06:26.738
simply that the available
technologies of coercion have

00:06:26.738 --> 00:06:28.350
not yet evolved.
 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.874
And so when it takes Hannibal's
elephants to get over the Alps

00:06:32.874 --> 00:06:37.473
they are a natural boundary in a
way that they are not when you

00:06:37.473 --> 00:06:40.069
can lob missiles over the Alps.
 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:44.471
And so we should always think
when he says "a natural

00:06:44.471 --> 00:06:47.327
monopoly over a given
territory,"

00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:52.038
to some extent what counts as a
given territory is going to be

00:06:52.038 --> 00:06:55.899
affected by available
technologies at force.

00:06:55.899 --> 00:06:59.809
And we could play this out if
you think about the transition

00:06:59.809 --> 00:07:02.990
from the Italian city-states to
modern Italy,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.480
a subversion of that,
the changing technologies of

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.759
force leads to the creation of
larger units.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:13.329
But as the points I've just
made suggest,

00:07:13.329 --> 00:07:17.524
this isn't entirely
straightforward and uniform,

00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:20.379
but it is one basic dynamic.
 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:23.795
So that's, I think,
what he would have said if

00:07:23.795 --> 00:07:26.528
somebody had raised that
question.

00:07:26.528 --> 00:07:29.783
And so you get a single
dominant protective association

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:33.360
within a given territory,
although we're agreeing that

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.346
the notion of what counts as a
territory is somewhat in flux

00:07:37.346 --> 00:07:40.319
and conditioned by technologies
of force.

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:45.154
That is, the dominant
protective association has

00:07:45.154 --> 00:07:49.579
co-opted or marginalized all the
others,

00:07:49.579 --> 00:07:55.485
and then you have a dominant
protective association which he

00:07:55.485 --> 00:07:58.690
calls the ultra-minimal state.
 

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.728
But then there are these
people, these independents,

00:08:01.728 --> 00:08:04.649
and he gives various colorful
examples of them.

00:08:04.649 --> 00:08:09.180
But as I said, this was 1974.
 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:14.254
If we think about it in today's
world you can think about these

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:19.250
as people who don't recognize
the legitimacy of the regime.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:25.413
So they could be people like
the gent who flew his plane into

00:08:25.413 --> 00:08:29.934
a federal building in wherever
it was, Texas,

00:08:29.934 --> 00:08:33.529
I think, a couple of weeks ago.
 

00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:38.654
It could be Timothy McVeigh who
blew up the Oklahoma Federal

00:08:38.654 --> 00:08:42.389
Building, or it could be Osama
bin Laden.

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:44.360
These people are out there and
they say,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.120
"Well, you might have your
dominant protective association,

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.840
but we don't care because we
don't like it,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.730
we don't recognize it,
and we're not part of it."

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.928
And Nozick wants to say,
"Well,

00:08:59.928 --> 00:09:05.000
just because coercive force is
a natural monopoly,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.676
these protective associations
can't give their members

00:09:08.676 --> 00:09:12.836
protection if they allow the
Osama bin Ladens and the Timothy

00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:15.820
McVeighs to run around out
there."

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.308
So what are they going to do?
 

00:09:17.308 --> 00:09:21.553
They're going to force them to
accept the authority of the

00:09:21.553 --> 00:09:22.149
state.
 

00:09:22.149 --> 00:09:24.788
They're going to force them to
participate.

00:09:24.788 --> 00:09:27.798
They're going to say,
"This is the deal.

00:09:27.798 --> 00:09:30.273
Take it and you can be part of
the association,

00:09:30.273 --> 00:09:33.500
or leave it and you're going to
be dealt with accordingly.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:34.500
We're going to lock you up.
 

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.259
We're going to kill you.
 

00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:37.808
We're going to do something to
you," right?

00:09:37.808 --> 00:09:42.811
That's what's going to happen
because it's the case that these

00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:47.484
associations cannot protect
their members if they don't do

00:09:47.484 --> 00:09:48.960
anything else.
 

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.519
I'm going to come back to that
in a minute.

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:52.697
So it's just,
at this level,

00:09:52.697 --> 00:09:56.004
it's just a claim about what
would happen,

00:09:56.004 --> 00:09:58.908
coercive force being what it
is.

00:09:58.908 --> 00:10:02.548
And then you have what he calls
the minimal state,

00:10:02.548 --> 00:10:06.812
AKA the classical night
watchman state of liberal

00:10:06.812 --> 00:10:09.696
theory,
the thing that Glenn Beck has

00:10:09.696 --> 00:10:13.274
in mind when he says,
"The government should

00:10:13.274 --> 00:10:17.190
protect us from the bad guys and
nothing else."

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:20.535
The government should protect
us from the bad guys and nothing

00:10:20.535 --> 00:10:20.918
else.
 

00:10:20.918 --> 00:10:24.250
The night watchman state
doesn't do anything else.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:30.240
In particular it does not
redistribute wealth.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.840
It does not redistribute income
and wealth.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.590
It does not go into those
Pareto un-decidable zones.

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:40.240
Think back to the Pareto
diagram.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.524
And the reason it doesn't go
back to those Pareto

00:10:44.524 --> 00:10:49.791
un-decidable zones is that we
have a very robust doctrine of

00:10:49.791 --> 00:10:52.379
individual rights,
right?

00:10:52.379 --> 00:10:56.256
Now you might say,
"Well, why should we buy

00:10:56.256 --> 00:10:57.330
that?"
 

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:02.916
And I think what Nozick would
say is, he would come back with

00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:06.918
the doctrine of deep pluralism
of values.

00:11:06.918 --> 00:11:08.720
There's deep pluralism of
values.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.490
We don't agree.
 

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.870
Some of us think we should have
a welfare state.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.418
Some of us think we shouldn't.
 

00:11:15.418 --> 00:11:18.333
Some of us think we should have
universal healthcare,

00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:19.399
some of us don't.
 

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:22.120
We don't agree about these
things.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:27.562
And because we don't agree
about these things there's not

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:33.490
going to be the pressure to
produce a redistributive state.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:37.565
We're going to look at it,
you know, one of his slogans is

00:11:37.565 --> 00:11:41.570
"rights as side-constraints
on our actions."

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.711
We think of rights as
side-constraints on what we can

00:11:44.711 --> 00:11:45.980
do to other people.
 

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:51.907
We can't elbow them as we go on
our way to maximize our own

00:11:51.907 --> 00:11:52.929
utility.
 

00:11:52.929 --> 00:11:54.860
Rights are side-constraints.
 

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:58.809
They're not end-states.
 

00:11:58.809 --> 00:12:01.028
They're not goals.
 

00:12:01.028 --> 00:12:06.687
So I don't want to give you
unnecessary jargon,

00:12:06.687 --> 00:12:11.730
but I guess I'll give it to you
anyway.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:13.509
I should have put it on a slide.
 

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:19.754
So the philosophical lingo for
the difference between Nozick

00:12:19.754 --> 00:12:23.327
and Rawls,
as we'll see later,

00:12:23.327 --> 00:12:27.610
on the one hand and
utilitarianism,

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:32.495
at least in Bentham's variance,
on the other hand is

00:12:32.495 --> 00:12:36.038
deontological versus
teleological,

00:12:36.038 --> 00:12:42.678
d-e-o-n-t-o logical,
deontological,

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:47.350
versus teleological,
t-e-l-e-o logical.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.783
And what is
captured--deontological

00:12:50.783 --> 00:12:55.639
is a word that comes from the
philosopher Immanuel Kant.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:58.840
We'll talk more about him in
connection with Rawls.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:03.958
I mentioned to you on Monday
the basic notion here is affirm

00:13:03.958 --> 00:13:08.903
principles that you would be
happy with no matter how they

00:13:08.903 --> 00:13:10.379
affected you.
 

00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:13.620
They're not hypothetical
imperatives.

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:15.976
They're not,
"I'll support private

00:13:15.976 --> 00:13:18.269
property if it makes me
rich."

00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:21.110
They're rather,
"If I support private

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.852
property I'll support it
regardless of whether it makes

00:13:24.852 --> 00:13:27.139
me rich or poor,"
right?

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:31.950
It's not dependent on any
particular empirical conditions.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.658
You would affirm it no matter
what.

00:13:34.658 --> 00:13:40.004
And Kant's famous example of a
categorical imperative is the

00:13:40.004 --> 00:13:42.360
thing Nozick appeals to.
 

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.490
"Respect people's
autonomy."

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.332
Don't treat them simply as
means to your own ends,

00:13:48.332 --> 00:13:50.529
but as ends in themselves.
 

00:13:50.529 --> 00:13:53.522
And he's saying, "Well,
if we want to respect people's

00:13:53.522 --> 00:13:56.832
autonomy (this is just a very
strong version of Mill's harm

00:13:56.832 --> 00:14:00.366
principle)--
if we want to respect people's

00:14:00.366 --> 00:14:05.009
autonomy we can't impose
conditions on them that they

00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:07.330
don't agree with."
 

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:12.750
And given this empirical fact
of deep pluralism of values

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:18.075
you're not going to get a
redistributive state out of my

00:14:18.075 --> 00:14:21.269
Robert Nozick's little story.
 

00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:27.500
So that's where it's going to
stop.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:34.232
Now you could say,
"Okay, what is really

00:14:34.232 --> 00:14:38.058
being established here?
 

00:14:38.058 --> 00:14:42.110
Why is Nozick walking us
through this zigzag?

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:45.172
I mean it's,
okay, it's one way to spend a

00:14:45.172 --> 00:14:49.057
Monday and Wednesday morning
between 10:30 and 11:30,

00:14:49.057 --> 00:14:51.000
but what is the point?
 

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.120
What really comes out of this?
 

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:57.340
Why is he doing this?"
 

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:01.426
And I think that we need to go
back through it a little bit

00:15:01.426 --> 00:15:03.470
more carefully now and see.
 

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:10.464
One of the things that he says
is he's telling us both an

00:15:10.464 --> 00:15:15.710
explanatory story and a
normative story.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:18.820
What I said here is basically
the explanatory story.

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:20.995
He's saying,
"If you took people like

00:15:20.995 --> 00:15:23.278
us and you said,
'What would happen if there

00:15:23.278 --> 00:15:24.340
wasn't a state?'
 

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.081
they would create a minimal
state and they wouldn't create

00:15:27.081 --> 00:15:28.139
anything more."
 

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:35.246
There's nothing normative in
that yet, at least not obviously

00:15:35.246 --> 00:15:35.840
so.
 

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:48.599
They would create Glenn Beck's
utopia and that's all that they

00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:50.899
would do.
 

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:54.432
You could argue about whether
or not he's right about that and

00:15:54.432 --> 00:15:57.673
I'll come back to that in a
minute, but that's not really

00:15:57.673 --> 00:15:59.179
Nozick's whole agenda.
 

00:15:59.179 --> 00:16:01.830
His real agenda is normative.
 

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:08.114
What he wants to say is,
"They would do this and

00:16:08.114 --> 00:16:13.190
this is the only legitimate
state."

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.288
He wants to convince you that
this kind of a state,

00:16:17.288 --> 00:16:20.649
the classical night watchman
state of liberal theory,

00:16:20.649 --> 00:16:23.697
liberal in the
nineteenth-century sense of the

00:16:23.697 --> 00:16:26.154
term,
libertarian we might think of

00:16:26.154 --> 00:16:30.543
it, I think,
today, is the only legitimate

00:16:30.543 --> 00:16:31.379
state.
 

00:16:31.379 --> 00:16:33.789
Now, if you said,
"Well, why?

00:16:33.789 --> 00:16:40.980
What makes it legitimate?"
 

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:47.702
the answer is that long and
rather difficult to decipher

00:16:47.702 --> 00:16:50.879
chapter on compensation.
 

00:16:50.879 --> 00:16:54.514
I'll give you the bumper
sticker version first and then

00:16:54.514 --> 00:16:56.870
I'll go back and walk through
it.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:03.085
And you might think it's
tendentious, but philosophers'

00:17:03.085 --> 00:17:08.150
examples often give philosophy a
bad name.

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:12.913
They create highly artificial
examples that abstract massively

00:17:12.913 --> 00:17:17.942
from the real world,
and people generally are not

00:17:17.942 --> 00:17:24.410
impressed when they try to
connect it to real problems.

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:28.105
My priors are to be suspicious
of philosopher's examples,

00:17:28.105 --> 00:17:30.019
but Nozick is an exception.
 

00:17:30.019 --> 00:17:33.548
He really was a brilliant guy,
and he doesn't do these things

00:17:33.548 --> 00:17:34.430
gratuitously.
 

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.662
There are some interesting and
consequential points that come

00:17:38.662 --> 00:17:39.650
out of this.
 

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:46.848
So here's what he wants to say.
 

00:17:46.848 --> 00:17:51.849
This is the crucial set of
moves, this one and this one.

00:17:51.849 --> 00:17:53.868
How is it crucial?
 

00:17:53.868 --> 00:17:58.384
What he wants to say is this:
we know that this is going to

00:17:58.384 --> 00:18:01.500
happen, what could make it
legitimate?

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:05.846
We know it's going to happen
because coercive force is a

00:18:05.846 --> 00:18:07.348
natural monopoly.
 

00:18:07.348 --> 00:18:12.618
In fact, being hardheaded
realists about power,

00:18:12.618 --> 00:18:17.762
no minimal or ultra-minimal
state is going to permit the bin

00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:22.818
Laden's and the McVeighs to run
around threatening them.

00:18:22.818 --> 00:18:24.220
So they're going to force them
to join.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:29.058
What could make it legitimate
for them to do that since these

00:18:29.058 --> 00:18:32.690
independents haven't agreed to
join, right?

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.118
And Nozick does want to say
agreement, consent,

00:18:36.118 --> 00:18:38.579
is the basis of all legitimacy.
 

00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:42.769
Seems like a contradiction.
 

00:18:42.769 --> 00:18:50.318
So he says, "What if we
put it in the following terms?

00:18:50.318 --> 00:18:56.150
What if we say to the
independent out there,

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.714
'You know what,
you don't recognize the

00:19:00.714 --> 00:19:05.982
legitimacy of our operation,
but it's too bad because there

00:19:05.982 --> 00:19:08.298
are a lot more of us than there
are of you,

00:19:08.298 --> 00:19:11.863
and we're going to force you
to, we're going to force you to

00:19:11.863 --> 00:19:15.720
participate,
but here's the thing.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.730
We understand that violates
your rights,

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:25.950
you as an independent are
having your rights violated,

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:36.306
but we as members are having
our rights violated by our fear

00:19:36.306 --> 00:19:40.869
that you may blow us up.
 

00:19:40.869 --> 00:19:41.598
Maybe you won't.
 

00:19:41.598 --> 00:19:44.653
Maybe you're just a
philosophical anarchist that

00:19:44.653 --> 00:19:48.224
wanders around the fields
talking to horses and wants to

00:19:48.224 --> 00:19:52.960
be left alone,
but we don't know that for sure.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:56.048
We don't really know that,
and there are some people who

00:19:56.048 --> 00:19:57.789
want to blow us up out there.
 

00:19:57.789 --> 00:20:00.058
We know that.
 

00:20:00.058 --> 00:20:06.018
So everybody in our society,
in our ultra-minimal state,

00:20:06.018 --> 00:20:12.518
is experiencing a decline of
utility because you're out there

00:20:12.518 --> 00:20:15.660
and you might blow us up.
 

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:21.288
Fear, we're experiencing fear.
 

00:20:21.288 --> 00:20:28.848
Now we understand that you,
if you're forced to join,

00:20:28.848 --> 00:20:32.618
you're going to experience a
rights violation,

00:20:32.618 --> 00:20:38.877
that's true,
but what if we could compensate

00:20:38.877 --> 00:20:40.769
you for it?
 

00:20:40.769 --> 00:20:42.650
We're going to force you to
join.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:49.234
What if we could compensate you
for it and still be better off

00:20:49.234 --> 00:20:55.172
than we were not having
compensated you and experiencing

00:20:55.172 --> 00:21:00.201
the fear?'"
So it's a somewhat muddled

00:21:00.201 --> 00:21:03.068
discussion in the chapter.
 

00:21:03.068 --> 00:21:06.150
When people start reading what
he says about compensation,

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:11.240
they think he's talking about
the members being compensated

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.392
rather than the independents,
but the idea is the members

00:21:16.392 --> 00:21:20.902
could compensate the
independents and still be better

00:21:20.902 --> 00:21:21.509
off.
 

00:21:21.509 --> 00:21:27.417
Now it doesn't mean the members
actually compensate the

00:21:27.417 --> 00:21:29.058
independents.
 

00:21:29.058 --> 00:21:31.773
Then there would be an obvious
moral hazard problem,

00:21:31.773 --> 00:21:32.200
right?
 

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.869
If my choice was to be a member
and pay taxes or to be an

00:21:35.869 --> 00:21:39.540
independent and get compensated
for being forced to join,

00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:41.769
nobody's going to be a member.
 

00:21:41.769 --> 00:21:44.095
We might as well be
independents and get

00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:44.930
compensated.
 

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:48.650
So he's not talking about
actual compensation.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:55.030
Rather he's saying,
"I'm going to violate your

00:21:55.030 --> 00:21:58.319
rights;
if in principle I could pay you

00:21:58.319 --> 00:22:02.393
enough to make you whole and
still be better off than before

00:22:02.393 --> 00:22:06.190
I violated your rights then
everything's hunky-dory.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:10.990
We're both better off in a
Pareto sense."

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:16.894
So what he does in that chapter
is he works his way through

00:22:16.894 --> 00:22:22.190
various ways this might happen,
and they all fail.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.358
They all run into problems.
 

00:22:23.358 --> 00:22:26.515
How would you figure the price,
etcetera, etcetera,

00:22:26.515 --> 00:22:27.019
right?
 

00:22:27.019 --> 00:22:31.881
And then he says, "Well,
it doesn't really matter that I

00:22:31.881 --> 00:22:37.730
haven't given a watertight
account of compensation,

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.750
but just let's assume that some
such account could be given,

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:44.578
then we'd have solved the
problem."

00:22:44.578 --> 00:22:52.163
And he's alluding here to about
forty years of welfare economics

00:22:52.163 --> 00:22:59.145
that revolved around this idea
of hypothetical compensation

00:22:59.145 --> 00:23:00.348
tests.
 

00:23:00.348 --> 00:23:05.326
Those of you who are interested
the famous people were Kaldor,

00:23:05.326 --> 00:23:09.160
Hicks, Scitovsky,
Samuelson, and many others.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.523
All were trying to figure out a
compensation test that was

00:23:13.523 --> 00:23:17.430
compatible with the Pareto
system as you know it.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:21.788
So a way of thinking about it
is we go back to our Pareto

00:23:21.788 --> 00:23:26.147
diagram and what we were doing
when we were talking about

00:23:26.147 --> 00:23:28.640
neoclassical utilitarianism.
 

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.319
Remember we said let's suppose
X is the status quo.

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:37.130
We know this is Pareto superior.
 

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.183
We know this is Pareto
inferior, and we can't say

00:23:40.183 --> 00:23:42.603
anything about the
Pareto-undecidables,

00:23:42.603 --> 00:23:43.240
right?
 

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:48.210
So the question is,
is Y better than X for society.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.821
There's no answer to that
question, and Nozick's endorsing

00:23:51.821 --> 00:23:52.710
that, right?
 

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:56.579
He saying, "B will think Y
is better.

00:23:56.579 --> 00:23:59.940
A will think X is better.
 

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:01.839
Who are we to adjudicate
between them?

00:24:01.839 --> 00:24:04.400
There's no way to do it."
 

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.316
But the people who are worrying
about compensation were thinking

00:24:08.316 --> 00:24:10.118
about a different question.
 

00:24:10.118 --> 00:24:13.818
They were saying,
"Well okay,

00:24:13.818 --> 00:24:20.097
we know we can't say that Y is
better than X for society,

00:24:20.097 --> 00:24:25.480
but couldn't we say that Z is
better than X.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:31.179
Although Z is Pareto
un-decidable,

00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:38.259
it's on the possibility
frontier."

00:24:38.259 --> 00:24:44.375
Remember the possibility
frontier was the locus of points

00:24:44.375 --> 00:24:49.180
where it's not possible to
improve, right?

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:54.476
So the compensation theorists
were actually interested in

00:24:54.476 --> 00:24:58.259
these two parts of the Pareto
diagram.

00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:02.221
They were saying,
"Can't we come up with

00:25:02.221 --> 00:25:07.174
some way to say that Z is a
social improvement on X even

00:25:07.174 --> 00:25:12.759
though it's Pareto un-decidable
because it's on the possibility

00:25:12.759 --> 00:25:14.108
frontier?
 

00:25:14.108 --> 00:25:17.542
Isn't there some way to say if
you move from off the

00:25:17.542 --> 00:25:21.715
possibility frontier to on the
possibility frontier you can say

00:25:21.715 --> 00:25:24.140
it's a social improvement?"
 

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.050
So in the lingo of welfare
economics that was the project

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.054
from Kaldor and Hicks,
Scitovsky, Samuelson,

00:25:31.054 --> 00:25:32.868
and all of the others.
 

00:25:32.868 --> 00:25:37.461
They were looking for a way to
do that that did not involve

00:25:37.461 --> 00:25:40.548
interpersonal comparisons of
utility;

00:25:40.548 --> 00:25:46.098
really important that it not
involve interpersonal

00:25:46.098 --> 00:25:52.327
comparisons of utility because
if you make interpersonal

00:25:52.327 --> 00:25:58.329
comparisons of utility you're
violating consent,

00:25:58.329 --> 00:25:59.210
right?
 

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:04.708
If you say, "Well,
Z is better than X,

00:26:04.708 --> 00:26:12.170
but A doesn't agree,"
you're violating A's rights.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.558
So is there some way to do that?
 

00:26:14.558 --> 00:26:20.355
And we see this all the time in
eminent domain cases when the

00:26:20.355 --> 00:26:26.346
city buys up property forcibly
against somebody's will to build

00:26:26.346 --> 00:26:27.410
a road.
 

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:32.885
There's this endless to-ing and
fro-ing about what is the value

00:26:32.885 --> 00:26:36.386
of the house,
and the question is,

00:26:36.386 --> 00:26:42.857
can you figure that out without
doing interpersonal comparisons

00:26:42.857 --> 00:26:44.318
of utility?
 

00:26:44.318 --> 00:26:52.104
And the problem with what
Nozick is doing is that the

00:26:52.104 --> 00:26:54.348
answer is no.
 

00:26:54.348 --> 00:26:58.830
The answer is every
compensation test that's ever

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:04.058
been devised involves coming up
with a common metric,

00:27:04.058 --> 00:27:06.907
namely money,
in terms of which you do the

00:27:06.907 --> 00:27:09.561
compensation,
and because of that,

00:27:09.561 --> 00:27:13.570
you're implicitly making
interpersonal comparisons of

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:14.420
utility.
 

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:20.977
So the project of finding a
compensation test that didn't

00:27:20.977 --> 00:27:27.769
violate the interpersonal
comparisons criterion failed,

00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:33.470
and you can't actually do what
Nozick wanted us to do.

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:39.440
Now you could say--here's,
again, an example of--

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.460
the whole architectonic theory
doesn't work,

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:50.410
but there still might be
important insights that survive

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:52.180
its failure.
 

00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.685
So you could say,
for instance,

00:27:53.685 --> 00:27:58.161
"Okay,
once we're aware of that,

00:27:58.161 --> 00:28:06.910
we can say that even in the
creation of a minimal state,

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:11.078
there are some interpersonal
comparisons of utility,

00:28:11.078 --> 00:28:19.325
namely those involved in
judging whether or not it's

00:28:19.325 --> 00:28:27.568
legitimate to incorporate the
independents."

00:28:27.568 --> 00:28:30.318
And Nozick might make the
following defense of what he's

00:28:30.318 --> 00:28:30.670
done.
 

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.219
He might say,
"Well okay,

00:28:33.219 --> 00:28:37.174
it was a nice try,
but still what's left of my

00:28:37.174 --> 00:28:40.339
argument is the following."
 

00:28:40.339 --> 00:28:50.618
 
 

00:28:50.618 --> 00:28:57.150
Another Kantian dictum is,
"Ought entails can."

00:28:57.150 --> 00:28:59.980
Anyone want to tell us what
that means?

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:05.880
What does it mean to say,
"Ought entails can?"

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:16.318
Anyone know?
 

00:29:16.318 --> 00:29:20.926
When we say,
"Ought entails can,"

00:29:20.926 --> 00:29:23.450
anyone want to guess?
 

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:28.278
Yeah?
 

00:29:28.278 --> 00:29:31.582
Student:  The normative
statements that we may make may

00:29:31.582 --> 00:29:34.939
create bright lines by which we
can determine whether an action

00:29:34.939 --> 00:29:38.577
is or is not acceptable,
and that's like--by saying that

00:29:38.577 --> 00:29:42.382
we should or should not do
something we create this bright

00:29:42.382 --> 00:29:46.720
line where on one side we should
and on the other side we can.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.098
Prof: You're in the
right direction.

00:29:48.098 --> 00:29:50.960
You're making it more
complicated than it needs to be.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:55.164
The basic idea is we can't have
a moral obligation to do

00:29:55.164 --> 00:29:57.460
something that's impossible.
 

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:01.275
We can't have a moral
obligation to do something

00:30:01.275 --> 00:30:04.403
that's impossible,
that's the way in which

00:30:04.403 --> 00:30:07.750
"ought entails can"
is usually interpreted.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:11.837
Now some people say we
shouldn't interpret Kant that

00:30:11.837 --> 00:30:12.318
way.
 

00:30:12.318 --> 00:30:15.808
We should interpret Kant to
mean when he says,

00:30:15.808 --> 00:30:18.258
"Ought entails can,"
that if we ought to do

00:30:18.258 --> 00:30:20.240
something,
we should find a way.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.748
I once had a graduate student
who wrote a dissertation in

00:30:22.748 --> 00:30:25.794
which he said,
"'Ought entails can' means

00:30:25.794 --> 00:30:28.202
that,
'Ought entails must try as hard

00:30:28.202 --> 00:30:29.848
as possible.'"
Well,

00:30:29.848 --> 00:30:34.140
that's one way you could go
with this,

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:36.058
but that's not what I have in
mind here.

00:30:36.058 --> 00:30:38.400
What I have in mind here,
that Nozick,

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.455
I think, would say when
confronted with the failure of

00:30:42.455 --> 00:30:46.358
the compensation tests to work
without interpersonal

00:30:46.358 --> 00:30:50.863
comparisons,
I think Nozick would say,

00:30:50.863 --> 00:30:53.800
"Well,
'ought entails can' in the

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.779
conventional sense.
 

00:30:54.779 --> 00:30:59.779
We can't expect people to do
something that's impossible,

00:30:59.779 --> 00:31:03.798
and for that reason what drives
us,

00:31:03.798 --> 00:31:06.278
really, is the natural monopoly
of force argument."

00:31:06.278 --> 00:31:08.190
Another way you could see this,
you could say,

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:12.740
"Well, so the problem with
the compensation argument,

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.542
compensating the independents
is, we could equally say if the

00:31:17.542 --> 00:31:22.266
independents could compensate
the members for their fear and

00:31:22.266 --> 00:31:26.430
still be better off that would
be just as good,

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.328
right?"
 

00:31:27.328 --> 00:31:30.700
Nozick's saying the members
experience the fear,

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:34.348
they force the independents to
join,

00:31:34.348 --> 00:31:38.354
and if they could compensate
them and still be as well-off

00:31:38.354 --> 00:31:41.425
then it's legitimate,
but you could do the exact

00:31:41.425 --> 00:31:41.960
opposite.
 

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.009
You could say,
"If the independents could

00:31:46.009 --> 00:31:51.605
compensate everybody,
pay everybody a certain amount

00:31:51.605 --> 00:31:57.790
so that they stop experiencing
fear and still be better

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:59.279
off."
 

00:31:59.279 --> 00:32:06.704
In effect Osama bin Laden did
this when Al-Qaeda made a

00:32:06.704 --> 00:32:09.140
deal in the 1980s.
 

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:16.505
They promised the Saudis that
they wouldn't do any terrorism

00:32:16.505 --> 00:32:22.123
in Saudi Arabia,
and then the Saudi government

00:32:22.123 --> 00:32:24.618
left them alone.
 

00:32:24.618 --> 00:32:26.410
I mean, that eventually
unraveled,

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.868
but so essentially you could
say that was a version of

00:32:29.868 --> 00:32:33.067
compensating the Saudi
population for the fear and

00:32:33.067 --> 00:32:34.828
still being better off.
 

00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:38.820
So Nozick would have to be
indifferent between those two

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.740
things if all that's driving it
is the compensation.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:44.200
I think what he would say is,
"Well,

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.118
in principle,
yes, but in practice,

00:32:46.118 --> 00:32:51.848
because of the natural monopoly
of force,

00:32:51.848 --> 00:32:55.190
it's the independents who are
going to lose.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:57.250
It's the independents who are
going to lose.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.848
There are fewer of them,"
right?

00:33:00.848 --> 00:33:04.588
And in the event,
just pursuing this example,

00:33:04.588 --> 00:33:09.217
in the event since both the
Saudis and everybody else knew

00:33:09.217 --> 00:33:14.087
that Al-Qaeda's ultimate
objective is regime change in

00:33:14.087 --> 00:33:18.162
Saudi Arabia,
it wasn't a very credible

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:24.222
promise, and indeed there were
Al-Qaeda operations in Saudi

00:33:24.222 --> 00:33:27.150
Arabia in the late 1990s.
 

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.009
So it wasn't a very credible
promise,

00:33:29.009 --> 00:33:34.703
and eventually after 9/11 the
Saudis smelled the coffee and

00:33:34.703 --> 00:33:40.890
got onboard with the operation
to try and stomp out Al-Qaeda.

00:33:40.890 --> 00:33:43.593
So yes, in principle,
if the independents could

00:33:43.593 --> 00:33:46.398
compensate blab-de-blah,
and just be as well-off,

00:33:46.398 --> 00:33:48.682
we would be indifferent,
in practice,

00:33:48.682 --> 00:33:52.130
because of the natural monopoly
of force,

00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:55.059
the independents are going to
lose.

00:33:55.059 --> 00:33:57.348
So ought entails can.
 

00:33:57.348 --> 00:34:02.087
It's not possible to imagine a
state of affairs in which the

00:34:02.087 --> 00:34:06.505
independents are tolerated,
so we'll accept that that is

00:34:06.505 --> 00:34:07.710
legitimate.
 

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:13.297
In other words,
the violation of rights in

00:34:13.297 --> 00:34:20.250
unavoidable, and therefore it's
not illegitimate.

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.230
That would be the claim.
 

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:36.570
Now Nozick would then say,
"So my argument survives.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:40.894
My argument survives,
because we've now supplemented

00:34:40.894 --> 00:34:45.559
the natural monopoly of force
with ought entails can.

00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:49.534
There's no way not to have the
ultra-minimal state become the

00:34:49.534 --> 00:34:53.213
minimal state,
so its legitimacy can't be

00:34:53.213 --> 00:34:57.927
criticized for the violation of
the rights of the

00:34:57.927 --> 00:35:00.090
independents."
 

00:35:00.090 --> 00:35:03.800
In a way it's a bit reminiscent
of Locke's argument about

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.909
majority rule that we're going
to talk about when we get to the

00:35:07.909 --> 00:35:10.760
last part of the course in more
detail.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:15.054
What you know already about
Locke from what I've told you in

00:35:15.054 --> 00:35:19.494
the past is that Locke says when
there are disagreements about

00:35:19.494 --> 00:35:23.789
what natural law entails there
is no earthly authority who's

00:35:23.789 --> 00:35:25.900
allowed to settle them.
 

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:27.739
Remember we went through this,
right?

00:35:27.739 --> 00:35:30.922
So each person,
in effect, has the right to

00:35:30.922 --> 00:35:35.088
enforce the law of nature,
and indeed the responsibility

00:35:35.088 --> 00:35:37.590
to enforce the law of nature.
 

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:39.931
God speaks to us all
individually when we read the

00:35:39.931 --> 00:35:41.827
scriptures,
and if you read them one way

00:35:41.827 --> 00:35:44.364
and I read them the other way,
there's no pope,

00:35:44.364 --> 00:35:47.556
there's no king,
there's no magistrate who can

00:35:47.556 --> 00:35:49.260
tell us who is right.
 

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:55.550
It's one of the sources of
Locke's egalitarianism.

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:59.054
Another thing that Locke says,
that I haven't talked about yet

00:35:59.054 --> 00:36:04.239
but will get into more detail,
is, so what actually happens in

00:36:04.239 --> 00:36:07.530
practice when people disagree?
 

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:15.945
He says, "If you think the
state is violating natural law

00:36:15.945 --> 00:36:25.045
not only do you have a right,
you actually have an obligation

00:36:25.045 --> 00:36:30.268
to resist,
but if nobody else agrees with

00:36:30.268 --> 00:36:33.449
you what's going to happen?
 

00:36:33.449 --> 00:36:36.679
You're going to be out of luck,
right?

00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:42.722
As Locke puts it he says,
"You should look for your

00:36:42.722 --> 00:36:46.018
reward in heaven,"
i.e.

00:36:46.018 --> 00:36:51.420
if you take the view that the
government is not legitimate,

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.599
and you're going to resist it,
and nobody else agrees with

00:36:54.599 --> 00:36:56.563
you,
you're going to wind up being

00:36:56.563 --> 00:36:58.300
tried for treason and executed.
 

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:02.210
That's what's going to happen,
but this life is short and the

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.297
next one's eternal,
so why worry,

00:37:04.297 --> 00:37:04.949
right?
 

00:37:04.949 --> 00:37:10.420
It's essentially Locke's view
of the matter,

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.440
right?
 

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:16.434
So the Nozickian independent is
in the same position as a

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:21.786
Lockean person who reads the
scriptures to say that they must

00:37:21.786 --> 00:37:26.869
resist the state and very few
others agree with them.

00:37:26.869 --> 00:37:30.050
They're just going to get their
reward in the next life.

00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:32.070
So be it.
 

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:35.409
But if lots of people agree
with you then you're going to

00:37:35.409 --> 00:37:38.510
have 1688, then you're going to
have a revolution.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:41.659
You're going to get rid of the
monarch, right?

00:37:41.659 --> 00:37:45.284
So you can't know for sure that
people are going to agree with

00:37:45.284 --> 00:37:47.719
you, but that's what's going to
happen.

00:37:47.719 --> 00:37:52.699
And in a way,
that is exactly the same point

00:37:52.699 --> 00:37:54.900
Nozick is making.
 

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.215
He's saying,
"There are a lot more

00:37:57.215 --> 00:38:00.262
people in the ultra-minimal
state than there are in

00:38:00.262 --> 00:38:03.309
independent,
so it's going to go that

00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:04.230
way."
 

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:05.760
There it is.
 

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:14.952
It's the nature of power,
the nature of coercive force,

00:38:14.952 --> 00:38:20.230
and ought entails can,
bingo.

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:24.380
What about that?
 

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:30.510
How many people find that
convincing?

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:31.659
Nobody?
 

00:38:31.659 --> 00:38:32.699
Nobody's convinced?
 

00:38:32.699 --> 00:38:37.130
How many people find it
unconvincing?

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:38.789
Nobody.
 

00:38:38.789 --> 00:38:43.632
There are zero convinced,
two unconvinced,

00:38:43.632 --> 00:38:48.827
and 136 undecided,
like Massachusetts voters,

00:38:48.827 --> 00:38:50.599
you people.
 

00:38:50.599 --> 00:38:54.929
What's wrong with it?
 

00:38:54.929 --> 00:39:10.260
Anyone want to...?
 

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.237
Student: Well,
it seems that forcing the

00:39:13.237 --> 00:39:17.360
independents to submit to the
minimalist state directly

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.711
contradicts the pluralistic
deontological values that it's

00:39:21.711 --> 00:39:25.349
espousing,
so it undermines the state at

00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:26.559
its very core.
 

00:39:26.559 --> 00:39:31.052
Professor Ian Shapiro:
And what does it contradict,

00:39:31.052 --> 00:39:33.119
the value of consent?
 

00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:34.710
Student: Excuse me?
 

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:37.079
Professor Ian Shapiro:
You say it directly contradicts

00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:39.360
the intellectual values he's
espousing--which value,

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.480
the value of consent?
 

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:46.016
Student: The value of consent
and how you said it should be

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:51.552
minimalist because he believes
in pluralism and because you

00:39:51.552 --> 00:39:55.128
can't force someone,
and like the Pareto thing,

00:39:55.128 --> 00:39:55.860
you don't know.
 

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.592
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Right, but his answer is ought

00:39:58.592 --> 00:39:59.329
entails can.
 

00:39:59.329 --> 00:40:02.744
It would be lovely if we could
get everybody's consent,

00:40:02.744 --> 00:40:05.780
but there's no way to get
everybody's consent.

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:09.789
Student: Well then from that
follows that the government

00:40:09.789 --> 00:40:14.019
should be able to enact other
kinds of policies where ought

00:40:14.019 --> 00:40:18.250
may entail can and they can
force people to do things.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:20.699
Professor Ian Shapiro:
So what would be an example?

00:40:20.699 --> 00:40:26.313
They would have to just
tolerate these independents out

00:40:26.313 --> 00:40:27.768
there, yeah?
 

00:40:27.768 --> 00:40:31.514
There's a little book I used to
teach in this course sometimes

00:40:31.514 --> 00:40:35.259
by a philosopher called Robert
Paul Wolff called In Defense

00:40:35.259 --> 00:40:38.530
of Anarchism,
and he basically goes the way

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:39.590
you were going.
 

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:49.550
He says, "Consent is the
wellspring of legitimacy.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:54.054
You can't get unanimous consent
for any state,

00:40:54.054 --> 00:40:57.155
so no state is
legitimate,"

00:40:57.155 --> 00:41:00.760
at least he's consistent,
right?

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.967
You can't get legitimacy for
any state so no state is

00:41:03.967 --> 00:41:04.768
legitimate.
 

00:41:04.768 --> 00:41:14.480
All states are illegitimate,
finished, end of story.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:16.170
Here's, I think,
what Nozick would say.

00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:20.329
He would make two points.
 

00:41:20.329 --> 00:41:25.496
He would say,
"Robert Paul Wolff is an

00:41:25.496 --> 00:41:33.244
airhead because he's forgetting
about the difference between the

00:41:33.244 --> 00:41:37.920
philosophical game we're
playing,

00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:41.702
the thought experiment and the
real world because in the real

00:41:41.702 --> 00:41:44.730
world there are two things that
are different.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.487
One is the natural monopoly
force argument we've already

00:41:47.487 --> 00:41:51.487
talked about,
and the ought entails can

00:41:51.487 --> 00:41:57.500
limitation that puts on what's
possible."

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:00.266
And you might not buy that
because you might say,

00:42:00.266 --> 00:42:03.434
if we had time to go back and
forth, you might just say,

00:42:03.434 --> 00:42:05.280
"I just don't buy that.
 

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.744
States could protect themselves
from independents without wiping

00:42:10.744 --> 00:42:12.739
out the independents.
 

00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:17.110
They could have policies of
containment."

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:18.849
I even wrote a book about that.
 

00:42:18.849 --> 00:42:23.018
So we could go back and forth
about that.

00:42:23.018 --> 00:42:29.039
But I think the other thing
that Nozick might say to Robert

00:42:29.039 --> 00:42:31.219
Paul Wolff is this.
 

00:42:31.219 --> 00:42:34.338
It would involve buying the
critique of the social contract

00:42:34.338 --> 00:42:34.929
metaphor.
 

00:42:34.929 --> 00:42:41.295
He would say, "Well,
we're behaving as though not

00:42:41.295 --> 00:42:45.199
having collective action is
really an option,

00:42:45.199 --> 00:42:50.731
but it isn't because it's
always the case that we have

00:42:50.731 --> 00:42:54.699
some collective action
regime."

00:42:54.699 --> 00:42:57.110
The question is just, which one.
 

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:04.907
So in any given situation if
you require unanimity you

00:43:04.907 --> 00:43:08.880
privilege the status quo.
 

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.280
We know that, right?
 

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.750
The garbage-in/garbage-out
problem,

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:20.434
and if some people want to have
a state and some people don't

00:43:20.434 --> 00:43:25.550
want to have a state,
if you start with a state then

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:31.106
requiring unanimity to change,
it harms the people who don't

00:43:31.106 --> 00:43:32.119
want a state.
 

00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:35.304
But if you start without a
state and requiring unanimity to

00:43:35.304 --> 00:43:37.829
change it, it harms the people
with a state.

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:43.422
So in either case you're going
to be harming somebody's rights,

00:43:43.422 --> 00:43:46.130
violating somebody's rights.
 

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:54.590
So the bottom line is that
anarchy,

00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:58.739
even if it existed,
if we had anarchism,

00:43:58.739 --> 00:44:05.059
wouldn't meet Wolff's criterion
of respecting everybody's

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:11.603
autonomy because there would be
some people who didn't want

00:44:11.603 --> 00:44:12.619
that.
 

00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:18.934
Okay, we've got two minutes
left so I'm going to leave you

00:44:18.934 --> 00:44:25.693
with what's the beginning of a
deeper puzzle about Nozick that

00:44:25.693 --> 00:44:29.349
we'll pick up on Monday with.
 

00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:34.280
You could say,
"Okay, we'll grant it.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.690
We'll grant everything you're
saying, Nozick."

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:51.789
But then, what if people start
to say,

00:44:51.789 --> 00:44:57.139
"Okay, we're now a minimal
state,

00:44:57.139 --> 00:45:00.949
but a lot of us are afraid of
unemployment,

00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:04.371
we see recessions come and go,
and unemployment can suddenly

00:45:04.371 --> 00:45:05.880
shoot up to ten percent.
 

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:09.173
I could lose my job,
not be able to pay my

00:45:09.173 --> 00:45:10.539
mortgage."
 

00:45:10.539 --> 00:45:22.168
That fear reduces a lot of our
utility, so we're going to

00:45:22.168 --> 00:45:35.250
create unemployment insurance,
and some people don't like it.

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:38.684
Some people would rather take
the risk, internalize the risk,

00:45:38.684 --> 00:45:39.829
but you know what?
 

00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:43.030
We're going to treat them in
just the way you treat

00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.989
independents.
 

00:45:43.989 --> 00:45:44.889
So we're going to say,
"Well,

00:45:44.889 --> 00:45:49.659
we know you don't like funding
unemployment insurance,

00:45:49.659 --> 00:45:51.860
you'd rather internalize the
risk, but you know what,

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:57.271
there are a lot more of us than
there are you and we believe we

00:45:57.271 --> 00:46:01.550
could compensate you for the
cost in principle.

00:46:01.550 --> 00:46:03.481
"Of course,
we don't compensate in

00:46:03.481 --> 00:46:04.039
practice.
 

00:46:04.039 --> 00:46:08.108
We believe we could compensate
you in principle for the rights

00:46:08.108 --> 00:46:11.510
violation of forcing you who
doesn't want to pay for

00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:15.445
unemployment insurance to pay
for unemployment insurance and

00:46:15.445 --> 00:46:17.179
still be better off.
 

00:46:17.179 --> 00:46:19.918
So tough luck,
you're going to pay for

00:46:19.918 --> 00:46:24.063
unemployment insurance and then
all of us will be happier

00:46:24.063 --> 00:46:28.208
because we'll be back on a
higher indifference curve than

00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:32.577
when we were worrying about what
might happen if we lose our

00:46:32.577 --> 00:46:33.909
job."
 

00:46:33.909 --> 00:46:36.460
And so the trouble with you,
Nozick,

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:41.099
is you're too clever for your
own good because either your

00:46:41.099 --> 00:46:45.494
argument doesn't establish
enough or it establishes too

00:46:45.494 --> 00:46:48.034
much,
because if we give you this

00:46:48.034 --> 00:46:51.742
type of reasoning to get to the
minimum state we can hijack

00:46:51.742 --> 00:46:55.449
exactly the same reasoning to
get to the welfare state.

00:46:55.449 --> 00:47:01.487
We can just put it in this
idiom of compensation for fear,

00:47:01.487 --> 00:47:07.630
and we can justify a more
extensive state than you want.

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:12.065
And so either your argument
doesn't get you the minimal

00:47:12.065 --> 00:47:15.599
state or it gets you too much of
a state.

00:47:15.599 --> 00:47:18.710
We'll start with that next time.
 

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:24.000

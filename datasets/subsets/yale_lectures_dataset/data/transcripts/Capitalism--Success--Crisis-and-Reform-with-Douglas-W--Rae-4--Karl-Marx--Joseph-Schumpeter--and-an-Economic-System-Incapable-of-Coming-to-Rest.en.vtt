00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.390
Prof: Okay,
let's go to work.

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.360
Violating the syllabus,
I've re-titled today's

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.123
discussion "From Marxist
Historicism to Howard Head's

00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:14.291
Tennis Racquet,"
and let's begin with Howard

00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:16.140
Head's tennis racquet.
 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:23.875
Howard Head was an alum of
Harvard College,

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:31.425
a bright guy,
and a not very good airframe

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:33.820
engineer.
 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.518
He was a second-class designer
of the details of airplanes for

00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:45.829
McDonnell Douglas Corporation,
and he was an avid skier,

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.785
and an avid,
but very untalented,

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:50.750
tennis player.
 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.990
As he tells the story,
there was a night on a bus,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:03.545
a motor coach to use his words,
bringing him back to New York

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:08.463
from Vermont,
from Stowe, and he'd had a

00:01:08.463 --> 00:01:12.709
rough weekend of skiing and he
said,

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:17.132
"What would happen if we
took the aluminum wafer with

00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:22.140
which we're building airplanes,
and made a ski from it?"

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.709
Sure enough he did that,
and the skiing industry,

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:30.775
not just the sale of skis but
the total size of the skiing

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:34.206
market,
was transformed forever because

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:38.239
skiing now became more fun and
vastly easier.

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:42.744
Five years later he had the
same--he applied the same

00:01:42.744 --> 00:01:45.950
thought process to tennis
racquets.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.135
At the time the world market in
tennis racquets had converged on

00:01:52.135 --> 00:01:56.683
the Bancroft wooden racquet,
named for Jack Kramer,

00:01:56.683 --> 00:02:00.578
who died--his obit is in The
Times this morning--

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:05.543
and everybody was competing on
price and details of quality

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:07.769
with the wooden racquet.
 

00:02:07.769 --> 00:02:11.438
There were no rules about how
big a racquet could be.

00:02:11.438 --> 00:02:17.843
It occurred to Head that,
if he substituted in the bow of

00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:21.330
the racquet,
substituted aluminum for wood,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.872
the structural properties of
aluminum would allow the head of

00:02:24.872 --> 00:02:26.818
the racquet to be much bigger.
 

00:02:26.818 --> 00:02:31.220
Do any of you play with giant
tennis racquets?

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.324
I know it's a point of pride
among really good players not to

00:02:35.324 --> 00:02:36.008
do that.
 

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:40.299
Mine--I retired from tennis
three or four years--mine at my

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.740
retirement was about like that.
 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.220
It makes tennis easy,
and it created a mass market

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.470
and it redefined the whole
business.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.615
Now the idea of creative
destruction, which is usually

00:02:55.615 --> 00:02:58.878
about things more complicated
than skiing and tennis;

00:02:58.878 --> 00:03:04.548
the whole idea of creative
destruction is that the process

00:03:04.548 --> 00:03:10.116
of competing to sell the best
product at the lowest price

00:03:10.116 --> 00:03:15.090
within the given market
framework often does,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.430
indeed, lead to something like
monopoly,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.289
or at least oligopoly,
and a point made at length by

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.340
Marxist critics of capitalism.
 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.431
As that happens,
it occurs over and over and

00:03:32.431 --> 00:03:38.007
over again,
that somebody like Howard Head

00:03:38.007 --> 00:03:44.651
finds an alternative technology
invariably aimed not at luxury

00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.205
markets,
aimed at regular people,

00:03:48.205 --> 00:03:52.789
and very seldom aimed at
corporate or governmental

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:55.387
buyers,
but again at private sector

00:03:55.387 --> 00:03:58.982
buyers,
and generates with that product

00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:03.313
an entirely new market,
shatters the equilibrium,

00:04:03.313 --> 00:04:05.020
hits it with a hammer.
 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.876
And this thought is,
on the one hand,

00:04:08.876 --> 00:04:11.340
antagonistic to Marx.
 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.562
That is, it is a way of
refuting Marx's idea about

00:04:15.562 --> 00:04:17.459
monopoly capitalism.
 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:22.492
On the other hand,
it is exactly in the spirit of

00:04:22.492 --> 00:04:25.656
young Marx,
the young Marx we hear in

00:04:25.656 --> 00:04:29.800
The Communist Manifesto
read for today's assignment,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.781
who saw capitalism as an
enormously productive system

00:04:35.781 --> 00:04:40.500
which was incapable of standing
still,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.940
which was always leaning
forward into the wind,

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.879
which was, to use Schumpeter's
term,

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:53.709
nothing more than a mechanism
for economic change.

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:58.673
According to Schumpeter the
very essence of capitalism is

00:04:58.673 --> 00:05:04.259
that it is a system always in
the process of revising itself.

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.949
It is never capable of standing
still,

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.540
and young Marx certainly
believed just about that same

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.634
thing,
and believed that the

00:05:15.634 --> 00:05:20.324
productive forces--
now remember he's writing in

00:05:20.324 --> 00:05:23.175
1847,1848--
that the productive forces

00:05:23.175 --> 00:05:27.569
associated with capitalism were
unprecedented in world history.

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:33.043
May I call on one of your
classmates to read the pivotal

00:05:33.043 --> 00:05:35.730
paragraph from that work?
 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.283
Student:  "The
bourgeoisie cannot exist without

00:05:39.283 --> 00:05:42.959
constantly revolutionizing the
instruments of production,

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.000
and thereby the relations of
production,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.139
and with them the whole
relations of society.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.757
Conservation of the old modes
of production in unaltered form

00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:52.113
was,
on the contrary,

00:05:52.113 --> 00:05:54.855
the first condition of
existence for all earlier

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:56.139
industrial classes.
 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.720
Constant revolutionizing of
production,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.329
uninterrupted disturbance of
all social conditions,

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:03.910
everlasting uncertainty and
agitation,

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:07.180
distinguishes the bourgeois
epoch from all earlier ones.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.326
All fixed, fast-frozen
relations, with their train of

00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:13.050
ancient and venerable prejudices
and opinions,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.199
are swept away.
 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.413
All new-formed ones become
antiquated before they can

00:06:17.413 --> 00:06:17.970
ossify.
 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:20.160
All that is solid melts into
air;

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.089
all that is holy, is profaned;
and man is at last compelled to

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:27.694
face, in sober sense,
the real conditions of life,

00:06:27.694 --> 00:06:30.709
and his relations with his
kind."

00:06:30.709 --> 00:06:32.209
Prof: Thank you very
much.

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:37.108
Marx is there talking about
the--at the time he's writing,

00:06:37.108 --> 00:06:42.180
railroads are just beginning to
transform the European world

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.470
around him.
 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.189
Steamships are a generation and
a half into transforming world

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.040
commerce.
 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:55.608
The use of newly efficient
steam engines in manufacturing

00:06:55.608 --> 00:06:59.480
is creating ever cheaper goods.
 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:05.901
The market in world textiles
has driven the price of ordinary

00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:12.704
cotton cloth nearly to zero,
so that nearly everyone in the

00:07:12.704 --> 00:07:15.791
market--
advanced market societies,

00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:18.348
can afford to dress,
more or less,

00:07:18.348 --> 00:07:20.389
the way all of you are dressed.
 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:26.069
That is to say,
whatever, look around.

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:32.863
But the point is that the
revolutionary transformation of

00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:37.968
the means of production,
and of what is produced and at

00:07:37.968 --> 00:07:41.730
what cost it sells,
is very much on Marx's mind.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:44.843
Additionally,
Europe is politically unstable

00:07:44.843 --> 00:07:45.930
in the 1840s.
 

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:52.076
And there are five or six nodes
of apparent revolutionary

00:07:52.076 --> 00:07:57.345
activity stretching from Austria
through Germany,

00:07:57.345 --> 00:07:59.980
into tsarist Russia.
 

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:08.875
And Marx imagines that his
relatively abstract analysis of

00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:13.088
capitalism is scientific.
 

00:08:13.088 --> 00:08:17.810
By scientific he means that it
has predictive force.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:24.302
That his science of economy and
society is so powerful that it

00:08:24.302 --> 00:08:28.028
allows him to foresee the
future.

00:08:28.028 --> 00:08:34.238
Not to foresee the exact dates
and details of future history,

00:08:34.238 --> 00:08:39.928
but that the broad outlines are
beyond human control.

00:08:39.928 --> 00:08:42.158
There are actually two
assertions here.

00:08:42.158 --> 00:08:46.318
One is that the world's history
is determinate,

00:08:46.318 --> 00:08:50.298
that it is like the machinery
of the heavens,

00:08:50.298 --> 00:08:55.000
it is like the planets
revolving around the sun.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.070
A good astronomer can readily
predict the phases of the moon,

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.639
the occurrence of eclipses,
all those things,

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:07.490
and that's science which was in
the past by Marx's time,

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:14.480
and which he aspired to that
level of confidence.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.750
We're going to look at his
historicism,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.855
that is, the double belief that
the world is deterministic and

00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:26.961
that he and his associates can
actually unlock the keys to the

00:09:26.961 --> 00:09:29.590
future,
under six headings.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:34.289
The first of which is monopoly
capitalism, and we'll take that

00:09:34.289 --> 00:09:35.600
up momentarily.
 

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.660
Second is the proposition that,
in the long run,

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.982
the rate of profit for
capitalist enterprises has to

00:09:41.982 --> 00:09:42.570
fall.
 

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.611
Third the immiseration of the
working class,

00:09:46.611 --> 00:09:50.749
that as profits fall,
so does the wage stream

00:09:50.749 --> 00:09:54.038
available to the working class.
 

00:09:54.038 --> 00:09:58.996
So both the capitalists and
their adversaries in the

00:09:58.996 --> 00:10:03.856
proletariat face a squeezing
vice which takes their

00:10:03.856 --> 00:10:07.940
discretionary power out of the
system.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:13.928
As the vice squeezes,
revolution becomes inevitable.

00:10:13.928 --> 00:10:16.572
That's the fourth point on
the--or the third point on the

00:10:16.572 --> 00:10:16.950
chart.
 

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:23.499
The fourth point is Marx's--I'm
a great respecter of Marx's

00:10:23.499 --> 00:10:30.048
brilliance, but the theory of
the universal class is almost

00:10:30.048 --> 00:10:31.629
childlike.
 

00:10:31.629 --> 00:10:36.812
The idea is that if you search
out the bottom of the bottom of

00:10:36.812 --> 00:10:41.400
the bottom classes than that
class will have the unique

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:45.480
property that it has no one else
to exploit.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:50.191
If it has no one else to
exploit then there won't be

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:53.662
exploitation,
and since the purpose of the

00:10:53.662 --> 00:10:57.720
state is to defend the interest
of an exploiting class,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.879
then the state will become
unnecessary and will,

00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:04.950
as the bottom line says here,
wither away.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:11.735
Now the many decades of
experience we have lead us to be

00:11:11.735 --> 00:11:19.017
friendly critics toward the top
of this story and unfriendly

00:11:19.017 --> 00:11:25.681
critics toward the bottom
because the story told at the

00:11:25.681 --> 00:11:31.610
bottom is not only false,
but dangerous.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:37.958
Monopoly capitalism--you'll
remember that when I was sitting

00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:44.524
with Jim Alexander last class
talking about Adam Smith and the

00:11:44.524 --> 00:11:49.690
conditions under which the
invisible hand remains

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.124
invisible,
I used the Porter Forces

00:11:54.124 --> 00:12:00.852
commonly used in MBA instruction
to define the opposite of each

00:12:00.852 --> 00:12:05.519
of the conditions put forward by
Smith,

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:08.528
and so I'm using them again
here.

00:12:08.528 --> 00:12:13.940
In a monopoly capitalist
situation, the monopolistic firm

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:18.480
has eliminated direct
competition or rendered it

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.639
trivial.
 

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:26.644
It has caused the erection of
high barriers to entry so that

00:12:26.644 --> 00:12:31.629
as its profits increase and
others say,

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:34.842
"What a good idea let's
get into that business,"

00:12:34.842 --> 00:12:36.759
it has ways of keeping them
out.

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:41.125
Or, once they come in,
of punishing them to the point

00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:42.470
of bankruptcy.
 

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:50.279
Third, these are products that
are not discretionary;

00:12:50.279 --> 00:12:51.918
they're hard to substitute for.
 

00:12:51.918 --> 00:12:56.210
You can't have a serious
monopoly in children's games.

00:12:56.210 --> 00:13:01.429
You can't have a serious
monopoly in a given fragrance of

00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:04.600
aftershave lotion or of perfume.
 

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.682
Serious monopolies are always
in things which people need and

00:13:09.682 --> 00:13:13.750
for which they don't readily
find substitutes.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:19.203
The firm is vertically
integrated, and by vertical

00:13:19.203 --> 00:13:24.323
integration I mean,
think about starting--well,

00:13:24.323 --> 00:13:29.000
let's take the laptop in front
of you.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.294
Starting with the aluminum,
the silica, the metal wires,

00:13:36.294 --> 00:13:39.899
all that stuff;
starting with raw materials

00:13:39.899 --> 00:13:42.491
that are in the earth,
extracting those,

00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:45.360
designing them,
fabricating them,

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.100
marketing the machine,
distributing the machine,

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.054
that whole long trail of
production from raw materials at

00:13:53.054 --> 00:13:57.363
the one end to finished product
in the hands of a buyer at the

00:13:57.363 --> 00:13:58.070
other.
 

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.095
Vertical integration,
in the extreme,

00:14:00.095 --> 00:14:03.190
means that the corporation
controls that whole sweep.

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:07.037
The part that reaches from
manufacturing toward the buyer

00:14:07.037 --> 00:14:10.058
is called "forward
integration."

00:14:10.058 --> 00:14:12.451
The part that reaches from the
manufacturer back to raw

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:13.914
materials is called
"backward

00:14:13.914 --> 00:14:14.889
integration."
 

00:14:14.889 --> 00:14:20.072
This pattern of integration
gives the company great power

00:14:20.072 --> 00:14:25.628
because there are no suppliers
who can hold up the firm for a

00:14:25.628 --> 00:14:27.850
part of its profits.
 

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:31.570
Buyers don't have leverage to
control prices.

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:38.005
Competitors can't manufacture a
very similar machine 20% cheaper

00:14:38.005 --> 00:14:40.558
and drive down profits.
 

00:14:40.558 --> 00:14:45.958
And people in substitute
industries don't have any way of

00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.370
drawing away customers.
 

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:52.578
That's the--I'm
caricaturing--but things which

00:14:52.578 --> 00:14:57.349
more or less fit that
description historically would

00:14:57.349 --> 00:15:00.528
be, for example,
Standard Oil.

00:15:00.528 --> 00:15:04.424
John D. Rockefeller who
controlled--who came into

00:15:04.424 --> 00:15:09.700
control of oil all the way from
exploration and the wellhead.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.330
Through refining and
distribution,

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.288
he came to control the
railroads,

00:15:17.288 --> 00:15:21.379
which his rivals would need to
use to distribute their product,

00:15:21.379 --> 00:15:27.798
and managed to use the
railroads to impose artificially

00:15:27.798 --> 00:15:35.168
high freight prices on his
competitors so that he was able,

00:15:35.168 --> 00:15:38.399
in effect, to monopolize the
whole industry.

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:43.470
The--U.S. Steel,
a similar story.

00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:46.720
This would be Andrew Carnegie.
 

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.548
Microsoft.
 

00:15:48.548 --> 00:15:56.360
There has been a long debate
about antitrust for Microsoft,

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.480
and it's pretty close to a
monopoly.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:07.336
I look around the room and I
see little white Apples

00:16:07.336 --> 00:16:12.850
illuminated everywhere,
and I have one myself.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:18.212
My eldest daughter is a
partner-level executive at

00:16:18.212 --> 00:16:23.248
Microsoft and in her house are
Apple computers,

00:16:23.248 --> 00:16:26.970
which I have given her family.
 

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:34.452
Another story of the same
instance is the regulated

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.100
airlines.
 

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:40.981
The regulated airlines,
this is before the late 1970s

00:16:40.981 --> 00:16:45.864
when the airlines were
deregulated, would own a route

00:16:45.864 --> 00:16:47.928
and monopolize it.
 

00:16:47.928 --> 00:16:50.830
And they would compete not on
the basis of price,

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:53.490
because they would charge
monopoly prices.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:58.947
They would compete on the basis
of food and attractive flight

00:16:58.947 --> 00:17:02.769
attendants--and I'm not going
near that.

00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:06.858
The big pharmaceuticals,
or pharmas,

00:17:06.858 --> 00:17:12.349
are sometimes in monopolistic
or near monopolistic positions

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.700
about drugs and many other
cases,

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.554
though fewer than the
ideological critics of

00:17:18.554 --> 00:17:21.009
capitalism would make you
believe,

00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:24.710
and fewer partly because of
creative destruction.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:29.619
As monopolies ossify people
find ways to blow them up.

00:17:29.619 --> 00:17:36.690
Let's talk about that.
 

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:41.638
On the left side of this little
diagram we have ways to build a

00:17:41.638 --> 00:17:46.348
monopoly, and on the right side,
ways to burn a monopoly.

00:17:46.348 --> 00:17:51.082
And on the vertical we have
market forces and on the

00:17:51.082 --> 00:17:56.279
horizontal, the top horizontal,
we have market forces.

00:17:56.279 --> 00:18:00.211
The bottom horizontal we have
governmental forces,

00:18:00.211 --> 00:18:05.027
and let's just get ourselves
familiar with the four resulting

00:18:05.027 --> 00:18:05.829
cells.
 

00:18:05.829 --> 00:18:16.905
Scale and scope, mostly scale;
if there are returns to scale

00:18:16.905 --> 00:18:23.804
so that each widget gets cheaper
to produce as you produce many

00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:28.628
of them,
the firm which is producing the

00:18:28.628 --> 00:18:35.269
largest quantities enjoys an
enormous strategic advantage.

00:18:35.269 --> 00:18:38.914
Illustrated here,
if number of widgets produced

00:18:38.914 --> 00:18:43.510
is on the horizontal dimension
and the marginal cost of the

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:47.878
last widget is vertical,
being positioned where this

00:18:47.878 --> 00:18:51.557
little green company is
positioned is an enormous

00:18:51.557 --> 00:18:56.769
advantage in comparison with the
little orange firms at the left.

00:18:56.769 --> 00:19:00.160
These are boutique firms doing
very little,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:04.544
and the giant producer,
which in the American economy

00:19:04.544 --> 00:19:08.170
for a very long time was General
Motors,

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.818
for example.
 

00:19:09.818 --> 00:19:13.826
It's General Motors and its
immediate competitors in Ford

00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:14.900
and Chrysler.
 

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.519
Let's--I'll illustrate the
point.

00:19:18.519 --> 00:19:24.634
At the time of--the decade
before World War I there were

00:19:24.634 --> 00:19:31.858
1,200 automobile manufacturing
companies in the United States,

00:19:31.858 --> 00:19:38.135
and almost all of them got
winkled out by the end of the

00:19:38.135 --> 00:19:39.048
1920s.
 

00:19:39.048 --> 00:19:42.180
There were about a dozen at the
end of the 1920s.

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:45.743
We're now approaching--what
number are we going to end up

00:19:45.743 --> 00:19:46.190
with?
 

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.098
Student:  Zero.
 

00:19:48.098 --> 00:19:49.808
Prof: Zero is one real
possibility.

00:19:49.808 --> 00:19:52.457
More likely,
I think one,

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:57.200
one and a half,
two, something like that.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:03.759
But the scale economies in that
kind of business are enormously

00:20:03.759 --> 00:20:05.028
important.
 

00:20:05.028 --> 00:20:11.934
Creative destruction,
and here we have Schumpeter

00:20:11.934 --> 00:20:16.393
again,
and one way of using Schumpeter

00:20:16.393 --> 00:20:22.720
is to take a very long view of
dominant technologies for energy

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.785
and production,
and look at how they have

00:20:26.785 --> 00:20:28.400
shifted over time.
 

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:35.210
In this chart--is that legible
for any of you or not?

00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.630
Not really?
 

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:37.690
Okay.
 

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:46.230
The chart begins with
production based on water power;

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:51.118
on mills based on falling water.
 

00:20:51.118 --> 00:20:54.410
It turns out historically that
these were very important.

00:20:54.410 --> 00:21:00.588
The first great advances in the
manufacture of textiles occurred

00:21:00.588 --> 00:21:05.690
in plants located along the
fault line of rivers,

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.173
where it was possible to
extract a great deal of energy

00:21:09.173 --> 00:21:12.400
from falling water and drive
mass manufacturing.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:18.337
Then you have creative
destruction with the emergence

00:21:18.337 --> 00:21:22.450
of steam and rail as
alternatives.

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:26.977
Then electricity,
and I won't pause long but the

00:21:26.977 --> 00:21:32.372
great battle of the 1890s was
between alternating current

00:21:32.372 --> 00:21:35.574
electricity,
controlled by George

00:21:35.574 --> 00:21:38.936
Westinghouse,
and direct current electricity

00:21:38.936 --> 00:21:43.012
controlled by Thomas Edison,
both of them as corporate

00:21:43.012 --> 00:21:43.578
leaders.
 

00:21:43.578 --> 00:21:52.732
Yale didn't fully give up on
direct current technology until

00:21:52.732 --> 00:21:54.750
about 1985.
 

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:58.938
There were dorm rooms were the
lights were actually run on

00:21:58.938 --> 00:22:03.346
direct current generated in a
plant over near where the swing

00:22:03.346 --> 00:22:04.670
dorms are now.
 

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:09.075
I'll leave it to sections for
you to parse this out because

00:22:09.075 --> 00:22:12.190
it's actually a very interesting
story.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:16.565
The advantage of direct current
electricity is it can't kill

00:22:16.565 --> 00:22:17.009
you.
 

00:22:17.009 --> 00:22:19.298
It doesn't matter how much,
it's not going to kill you.

00:22:19.298 --> 00:22:23.429
The disadvantage of direct
current electricity is that as

00:22:23.429 --> 00:22:26.598
you put it through a long
transmission wire,

00:22:26.598 --> 00:22:30.358
you lose most of it after the
first five miles.

00:22:30.358 --> 00:22:36.728
So Edison controlled direct
current electricity,

00:22:36.728 --> 00:22:43.640
and wanted to make the
government regulate it in.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.619
So what did he do?
 

00:22:45.619 --> 00:22:48.519
He stressed safety.
 

00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:51.223
And so if Edison had won,
there would have been a

00:22:51.223 --> 00:22:54.828
generating plant about every
five miles all over the country,

00:22:54.828 --> 00:22:58.109
in every urban neighborhood its
own generating plant.

00:22:58.109 --> 00:23:00.549
How did he dramatize that?
 

00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:03.848
Yes.
 

00:23:03.848 --> 00:23:04.509
Student:  The electric
chair.

00:23:04.509 --> 00:23:06.528
Prof: The electric
chair, exactly.

00:23:06.528 --> 00:23:10.413
He put forward the view that,
well Westinghouse has a great

00:23:10.413 --> 00:23:13.160
technology if you want to kill
people,

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.865
and actually did demonstrations
on animals and all that sort of

00:23:17.865 --> 00:23:19.640
thing,
it was just awful.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:26.170
Ultimately it was a case where
the unregulated market won.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:30.102
The government stayed out of
it, and alternating current,

00:23:30.102 --> 00:23:33.753
from the point of view of
illuminating our classroom,

00:23:33.753 --> 00:23:35.440
is pretty efficient.
 

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:39.348
Then you get petrochemicals and
digital networks--

00:23:39.348 --> 00:23:41.450
this is all very stylized in
this diagram--

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:47.750
but the point is that
monopolies, one after another,

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.069
after another,
after another get winkled out

00:23:50.069 --> 00:23:52.660
by these changes in the
underlying technology.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:58.451
New Haven at one time was
arguably the leading

00:23:58.451 --> 00:24:04.500
manufacturing city for horse
drawn carriages.

00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:08.390
Well, it was over,
and over pretty suddenly.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.028
Regulatory capture.
 

00:24:13.028 --> 00:24:16.798
Regulatory capture means what
it says,

00:24:16.798 --> 00:24:20.242
and there's a basic political
science kind of a thesis about

00:24:20.242 --> 00:24:23.054
this,
which is that regulatory

00:24:23.054 --> 00:24:28.328
agencies get captured by the
companies they regulate.

00:24:28.328 --> 00:24:35.865
If I'm a bank or a brokerage,
I'm intensely interested in the

00:24:35.865 --> 00:24:41.769
SEC and I develop friendly
relations with it.

00:24:41.769 --> 00:24:46.221
I feed information to its
staff, its staff comes to rely

00:24:46.221 --> 00:24:46.868
on me.
 

00:24:46.868 --> 00:24:50.942
After spending a cycle of four
or eight years in a politically

00:24:50.942 --> 00:24:54.078
appointed position in the
regulatory agency,

00:24:54.078 --> 00:24:58.776
it occurs to people that they
might pursue a career in the

00:24:58.776 --> 00:25:01.660
industry they've been
regulating.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:06.519
There gets to be a reciprocal
relationship there,

00:25:06.519 --> 00:25:12.595
which allows a dominant firm to
enjoy some advantage from its

00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:16.240
relationship with the regulator.
 

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:23.051
The current crisis in banking
is a little different from this

00:25:23.051 --> 00:25:27.140
and it's not really
monopolistic,

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:34.300
but it is not unfair to suppose
that Goldman Sachs has enjoyed a

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:40.894
fruitful relationship to the
Federal government in the last

00:25:40.894 --> 00:25:46.253
four or five decades,
and that there have been very

00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:50.815
few times when there wasn't a
Goldman Sachs partner in a

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:54.048
position to influence key
decisions.

00:25:54.048 --> 00:25:57.210
The more classic story would be
the airlines,

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.338
the one I told you where TWA,
Pan Am,

00:26:01.338 --> 00:26:05.441
and all the others of that era
had this monopolistic

00:26:05.441 --> 00:26:09.058
relationship created by airline
regulation.

00:26:09.058 --> 00:26:14.763
What killed them was that
enjoying a monopoly relationship

00:26:14.763 --> 00:26:20.670
to the airline regulators
allowed them to be pretty soft.

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:23.470
They didn't have to control
costs;

00:26:23.470 --> 00:26:27.648
they could waste $.15 of every
dollar in profits and still look

00:26:27.648 --> 00:26:29.470
great to their investors.
 

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:34.671
When deregulation came the
"legacy"

00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:41.762
costs were lethal to many of
these firms because they were up

00:26:41.762 --> 00:26:45.134
against,
now, they were up against

00:26:45.134 --> 00:26:49.608
airlines like Southwest which
had no legacy costs and ran very

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:50.710
efficiently.
 

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:55.608
Finally, antitrust.
 

00:26:55.608 --> 00:27:01.994
Antitrust emerges in the states
with the Sherman Antitrust Act

00:27:01.994 --> 00:27:05.227
of 1890 and is--
there is a continuous

00:27:05.227 --> 00:27:09.141
oscillation in government policy
here and in most other market

00:27:09.141 --> 00:27:11.584
economies,
between strict and not so

00:27:11.584 --> 00:27:14.858
strict interpretation of what
counts as a monopoly,

00:27:14.858 --> 00:27:19.358
and what counts as predatory
monopolistic behavior.

00:27:19.358 --> 00:27:24.365
When we get to cases we will
see several specific instances

00:27:24.365 --> 00:27:25.230
of this.
 

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:32.650
Falling rate of profit.
 

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:37.440
Remember those of you who were
here the first class,

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:44.960
the slides that contrasted
labor intensive production,

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:50.055
and for example,
I had two yaks pulling a plow

00:27:50.055 --> 00:27:56.056
in Tibet juxtaposed to a
twenty-ton John Deere tractor

00:27:56.056 --> 00:28:01.358
tilling earth in Minnesota,
Iowa or some such place.

00:28:01.358 --> 00:28:06.884
On the one side you had
relatively low production per

00:28:06.884 --> 00:28:12.516
labor hour and on the other an
enormously high rate of

00:28:12.516 --> 00:28:18.853
production per labor hour,
but based on capital outlays

00:28:18.853 --> 00:28:24.069
for the equipment like the John
Deere tractor,

00:28:24.069 --> 00:28:25.598
well into six figures.
 

00:28:25.598 --> 00:28:40.289
The Marxist idea of how capital
makes money from labor is that

00:28:40.289 --> 00:28:45.039
capital--
that labor is a commodity and

00:28:45.039 --> 00:28:48.877
the labor theory of value more
or less applies to that

00:28:48.877 --> 00:28:49.818
commodity.
 

00:28:49.818 --> 00:28:53.779
How much do you have to pay for
the commodity which he calls

00:28:53.779 --> 00:28:56.130
labor power or laboring
powering?

00:28:56.130 --> 00:29:01.950
Well you have to pay what it
costs to feed the worker,

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:06.298
to clothe the worker,
to rear his or her children,

00:29:06.298 --> 00:29:11.769
you have--the analogy is
imagine you have a plow horse,

00:29:11.769 --> 00:29:14.880
what does it cost you to
maintain the plow horse?

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:20.288
Well that same reasoning Marx
applies to the workforce.

00:29:20.288 --> 00:29:26.150
You pay wages that are broadly
consistent with that.

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:33.595
In my diagram the laboring
power is represented by the blue

00:29:33.595 --> 00:29:40.269
and capital pays labor that much
for its activity.

00:29:40.269 --> 00:29:46.548
The total pie represents how
much value is produced by labor

00:29:46.548 --> 00:29:51.548
and what's left over is called
surplus value.

00:29:51.548 --> 00:29:57.192
The capitalist firm keeps the
surplus value,

00:29:57.192 --> 00:30:05.065
by that means exploits labor,
and by that means increases its

00:30:05.065 --> 00:30:08.740
wealth to create wealth.
 

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:16.088
Now that leaves out a lot.
 

00:30:16.088 --> 00:30:19.980
One thing it leaves out is the
fundamentals of supply and

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.298
demand for labor.
 

00:30:21.298 --> 00:30:27.333
It doesn't take into account
the idea that labor would be

00:30:27.333 --> 00:30:32.719
extremely cheap in this
phase--how many people here

00:30:32.719 --> 00:30:37.460
haven't seen the demographic
transition?

00:30:37.460 --> 00:30:40.865
Good, because we did it a
couple days ago,

00:30:40.865 --> 00:30:43.690
but I never know about
turnover.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:48.992
Marx is oblivious to that
except how would he answer if I

00:30:48.992 --> 00:30:50.130
said that?
 

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:53.436
He would say,
well no labor is cheaper in

00:30:53.436 --> 00:30:58.397
these conditions because the
socially shared expectations for

00:30:58.397 --> 00:31:02.790
how well they have to be fed,
clothed, and their children

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.900
reared are low in those
conditions.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.271
Village India,
the cost of labor power is

00:31:08.271 --> 00:31:12.150
vastly less then it is in
Midtown Manhattan;

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:14.940
that's one issue.
 

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:19.086
Another issue,
this is the age curve,

00:31:19.086 --> 00:31:24.960
and it's just an embellishment
of the demography.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:29.663
Another is how hard people work;
this is a Breugel sixteenth

00:31:29.663 --> 00:31:34.829
century picture of agricultural
labor, which by the evidence

00:31:34.829 --> 00:31:37.368
there is not very intense.
 

00:31:37.368 --> 00:31:48.742
The idea that you pay for what
you get in labor is a powerful

00:31:48.742 --> 00:31:52.137
one,
and the so-called scientific

00:31:52.137 --> 00:31:55.019
management movement of a century
ago,

00:31:55.019 --> 00:31:58.650
which grew up around large
manufacturing companies in the

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.038
U.S.
 

00:31:59.038 --> 00:32:03.171
and Europe, was that you
develop incentives to make

00:32:03.171 --> 00:32:05.318
people work really hard.
 

00:32:05.318 --> 00:32:11.400
The simplest case was Henry
Ford's $5 a day salary,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.405
which was way above market
prices, but allowed him to be

00:32:15.405 --> 00:32:19.826
very choosy about his workers,
to demand very intense labor,

00:32:19.826 --> 00:32:23.858
and to demand that they allow
him to inspect their lives.

00:32:23.858 --> 00:32:27.788
He had what he called
sociologists who went around to

00:32:27.788 --> 00:32:32.169
people's houses looking for
alcohol or devices for gambling

00:32:32.169 --> 00:32:36.852
and so on but intensity of labor
is another variable that needs

00:32:36.852 --> 00:32:38.588
to be thought of.
 

00:32:38.588 --> 00:32:45.636
Now I just made that story
sound really sensible,

00:32:45.636 --> 00:32:53.420
I think, but the logic of it
has always escaped me.

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:59.337
The notion that labor is
different from any other

00:32:59.337 --> 00:33:05.380
standard for measuring value and
that you can--

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:07.140
you attribute to labor the
whole pie,

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:11.163
but actually you've got to
attribute much of the pie to

00:33:11.163 --> 00:33:11.910
capital.
 

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:16.910
Beyond capital you've got to
attribute much of it to

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:22.500
ownership and to management,
and intellectual property.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:27.144
Knowhow, the ability to
actually made widgets well and

00:33:27.144 --> 00:33:31.962
effectively at low costs,
all that is left out of Marx's

00:33:31.962 --> 00:33:32.838
story.
 

00:33:32.838 --> 00:33:37.435
He assumes, he just says,
"necessary labor

00:33:37.435 --> 00:33:43.230
time" and draws attention
away from what capitalism is

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:46.272
best at,
which is again and again

00:33:46.272 --> 00:33:49.180
revising the way we produce
something,

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.240
the way we distribute it,
the way we design it,

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.190
the way we design the machinery
that creates it,

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:59.788
even the way we design the
machinery that designs the

00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:02.746
product,
all of that is marginalized in

00:34:02.746 --> 00:34:04.210
a Marxist analysis.
 

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:09.956
And for that reason Marxism
does not function well in

00:34:09.956 --> 00:34:14.710
analyzing real companies in real
markets.

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:21.603
Now the surplus value that can
be extracted depends on how much

00:34:21.603 --> 00:34:24.940
labor is used in production.
 

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:31.139
As total labor used in
production goes towards zero,

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:34.710
the opportunity to exploit
workers goes away,

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:41.780
and with it profits have to
fall, and from that follows the

00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:46.170
evisceration of the working
class.

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:53.659
Look at this bottling plant
where the work is to sit at this

00:34:53.659 --> 00:35:00.007
control panel and adjust the
process, plus a little

00:35:00.007 --> 00:35:02.039
maintenance.
 

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:06.940
Have any of you been in a plant
where there were virtually no

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.409
workers present?
 

00:35:08.409 --> 00:35:15.010
Can you hand him the microphone?
 

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:21.672
Student:  It was the
Celestial Seasonings tea factory

00:35:21.672 --> 00:35:24.268
in Boulder, Colorado.
 

00:35:24.268 --> 00:35:27.347
It's just machines
putting--sorting leaves,

00:35:27.347 --> 00:35:29.179
putting them into bags.
 

00:35:29.179 --> 00:35:33.405
And there are like three or
four workers in this huge room

00:35:33.405 --> 00:35:36.889
sitting at this screen adjusting
(inaudible).

00:35:36.889 --> 00:35:38.489
Prof: Right, exactly.
 

00:35:38.489 --> 00:35:40.340
Other examples?
 

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:48.831
In the back,
can we get a mic back to the

00:35:48.831 --> 00:35:52.230
very last row?
 

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:55.994
Student:  I took a tour
of the Tsing Dao Beer Factory in

00:35:55.994 --> 00:35:56.480
China.
 

00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.059
I mean, it's fairly old,
I mean, the only people working

00:36:00.059 --> 00:36:03.771
there were tour guides and
inspectors that were within the

00:36:03.771 --> 00:36:05.659
&gt;
 

00:36:05.659 --> 00:36:08.010
Prof: So a very high
degree of automation?

00:36:08.010 --> 00:36:08.920
Student:  Yes.
 

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:14.266
Prof: I was some years
ago in a textile factory in

00:36:14.266 --> 00:36:20.570
Turkey, which covered six acres
of interior manufacturing space.

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:25.695
Every square foot of it was
either an aisle between

00:36:25.695 --> 00:36:30.639
machinery or machinery,
and virtually all the machinery

00:36:30.639 --> 00:36:33.701
was working,
and the cloth was coming out in

00:36:33.701 --> 00:36:37.110
bolts like this at ten or twelve
different points,

00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:40.449
and automata were throwing it
on conveyer belts,

00:36:40.449 --> 00:36:43.978
and conveyer belts were taking
it where it needed to be for

00:36:43.978 --> 00:36:46.628
shipping,
and labeling it and having it

00:36:46.628 --> 00:36:47.489
ready to go.
 

00:36:47.489 --> 00:36:49.619
When I was there,
there were about six people in

00:36:49.619 --> 00:36:52.762
the plant,
all of them technicians and the

00:36:52.762 --> 00:36:57.869
story about the plant was that
it could operate that way for as

00:36:57.869 --> 00:37:02.809
much as 60 hours and then there
would be a shutdown for a few

00:37:02.809 --> 00:37:06.268
hours of maintenance and
adjustment,

00:37:06.268 --> 00:37:09.760
and then another 60 hours and
so on.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.780
Another historical example is
the Bonsack Cigarette Machine;

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.239
cigarettes were not popular
before the Bonsack Cigarette

00:37:18.239 --> 00:37:19.050
Machine.
 

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:23.240
The Bonsack Cigarette Machine
could make 6,000 cigarettes per

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.500
hour,
which--they're now much better

00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:28.528
than that,
they're 100,000 an hour--but at

00:37:28.528 --> 00:37:31.409
6,000 per hour with zero labor
cost,

00:37:31.409 --> 00:37:35.815
it occurred to the people who
formed American Tobacco that

00:37:35.815 --> 00:37:39.990
they could make an awful lot of
money if they created a

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:43.838
marketing end,
that would allow them to pump

00:37:43.838 --> 00:37:48.349
all those thousands of
cigarettes out into the market.

00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:50.389
And they did it,
and did a very good job of it.

00:37:50.389 --> 00:37:54.429
At the core of it was this
little piece of technology,

00:37:54.429 --> 00:37:59.887
continuous production,
and paper and tobacco leaf go

00:37:59.887 --> 00:38:05.036
in one end of the machine,
and cigarettes neatly stacked

00:38:05.036 --> 00:38:07.929
in consecutive order come out
the other.

00:38:07.929 --> 00:38:23.369
So capital intensivity takes
labor out of the picture.

00:38:23.369 --> 00:38:28.380
In effect, the dead who created
the machinery are the producers.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:33.789
Inevitable revolution in
advanced capitalist societies.

00:38:33.789 --> 00:38:39.369
The idea here is that with
falling rates of capital and the

00:38:39.369 --> 00:38:44.951
immiseration of the working
class, this system ceases to be

00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:46.010
stable.
 

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:53.400
This is a guy named Georgi
Plekhanov,

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:58.889
and Plekhanov was a Marxist who
was a follower of Lenin's,

00:38:58.889 --> 00:39:02.159
and he's famous for having
asked the question,

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:05.059
"If the revolution is
inevitable,

00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:07.849
why must we fight and die to
make it happen?"

00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:13.536
That's an interesting question,
and it gets the name

00:39:13.536 --> 00:39:15.989
Plekhanov's paradox.
 

00:39:15.989 --> 00:39:21.693
And of course the answer to it
is that the revolution wasn't

00:39:21.693 --> 00:39:22.949
inevitable.
 

00:39:22.949 --> 00:39:26.693
Where it did happen,
it didn't happen for the

00:39:26.693 --> 00:39:28.820
reasons Marx described.
 

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:33.588
Where were the most advanced
systems where you would expect

00:39:33.588 --> 00:39:36.550
the capital intensive
production,

00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:40.400
falling rate of profit,
and low wages to labor,

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.949
where were those systems?
 

00:39:41.949 --> 00:39:43.289
Let's name a few countries.
 

00:39:43.289 --> 00:39:44.480
Yes.
 

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:45.579
Student:  UK,
Germany and the U.S.

00:39:45.579 --> 00:39:48.690
Prof: UK,
Germany and the U.S.

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:54.159
Those are not the places where
the revolution happened.

00:39:54.159 --> 00:39:59.779
It happened most dramatically
in Russia, and then by conquest

00:39:59.779 --> 00:40:03.900
in the rest of the Soviet Union,
and Cuba.

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:11.559
This is Fidel on the right and
Che Guevara on the left.

00:40:11.559 --> 00:40:15.730
There was--I have a photograph
in my collection at home of

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.974
Fidel Castro at the New Haven
train station and a New Haven

00:40:19.974 --> 00:40:23.559
policeman looking at him like
he's from Mars.

00:40:23.559 --> 00:40:26.784
And it was just after the
revolution when they

00:40:26.784 --> 00:40:29.510
hadn't--when the break with the
U.S.

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:32.630
hadn't really hardened,
and he was on a university tour

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.922
speaking on college campuses
trying to raise money for the

00:40:35.922 --> 00:40:36.789
revolution.
 

00:40:36.789 --> 00:40:43.168
Cuba was not an advanced
capitalist economy and still

00:40:43.168 --> 00:40:44.150
isn't.
 

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:47.628
The best thing you can say
about--I've been twice and have

00:40:47.628 --> 00:40:50.010
been a guest of the government
once,

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:54.340
and the best thing you can say
for them is that they actually

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:58.599
have done a splendid job with
rudimentary public health,

00:40:58.599 --> 00:41:04.510
so that on the longevity
dimension of the data automation

00:41:04.510 --> 00:41:08.375
we looked at,
if you'll screen it up tonight

00:41:08.375 --> 00:41:11.420
you'll discover a little green
moon way,

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:13.219
way high side outlier on
longevity,

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:14.809
and that's Cuba.
 

00:41:14.809 --> 00:41:17.380
On the other hand they are dirt
poor.

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:23.086
China, not an advanced
industrial economy when the

00:41:23.086 --> 00:41:27.893
revolution occurred;
Venezuela, an oil state,

00:41:27.893 --> 00:41:33.128
and whether the revolution has
occurred or not is open to

00:41:33.128 --> 00:41:34.250
question.
 

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:39.637
And this at the height of the
Cold War was the way the chess

00:41:39.637 --> 00:41:44.855
board looked,
where red meant Marxist and

00:41:44.855 --> 00:41:52.760
pink meant sort of Marxist,
and the game of controlling

00:41:52.760 --> 00:42:01.936
emerging market countries was at
the core of Cold War strategy or

00:42:01.936 --> 00:42:04.230
very near it.
 

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:08.239
The theory of the universal
class.

00:42:08.239 --> 00:42:17.414
If the aristocracy exploits
serfs in medieval European

00:42:17.414 --> 00:42:21.661
society,
and capitalists exploit

00:42:21.661 --> 00:42:25.429
proletarians in capitalist
society,

00:42:25.429 --> 00:42:31.239
and proletarians come to power,
who are they going to exploit?

00:42:31.239 --> 00:42:33.039
There's no one below them.
 

00:42:33.039 --> 00:42:37.829
Since there's no one below them
they are the universal class and

00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:39.579
exploitation is over.
 

00:42:39.579 --> 00:42:45.309
Now please.
 

00:42:45.309 --> 00:42:51.405
So the reasoning is like the
eastern division of the American

00:42:51.405 --> 00:42:57.400
League, and Baltimore is the
universal class because there's

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.940
no one they can beat.
 

00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:08.619
What's at the core of this last
thing,

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:11.429
and it is truly dangerous
reasoning,

00:43:11.429 --> 00:43:15.728
is that the universal class,
being in a position superior to

00:43:15.728 --> 00:43:20.324
no other class,
brings an end to exploitation,

00:43:20.324 --> 00:43:25.690
and since that's true the state
can wither away.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:37.757
Now it doesn't happen in a
hurry, and behind this is a

00:43:37.757 --> 00:43:48.460
really fundamental issue of
principal agency.

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.130
Did we talk about principle
agency a few days ago?

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:54.090
Maybe not, well let's just for
simplicity,

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:59.945
let's suppose the people own
the country and the Communist

00:43:59.945 --> 00:44:06.110
government is the agent that
they have elected to choose,

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.152
or which has chosen itself to
manage the country on behalf of

00:44:10.152 --> 00:44:11.030
the people.
 

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:16.699
The principal agency problem
which occurs in things as small

00:44:16.699 --> 00:44:22.369
as a grocery store is that the
employee's agents choose,

00:44:22.369 --> 00:44:26.900
instead of serving the purposes
of the owners or the country,

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.340
choose to serve purposes of
their own.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:38.246
The invariable fact about state
socialism was that the people at

00:44:38.246 --> 00:44:45.902
the top of the state apparatus
privileged themselves and their

00:44:45.902 --> 00:44:50.951
children,
and a new class struggle

00:44:50.951 --> 00:44:52.460
developed.
 

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:57.757
Now, more generally and here
I'm using the work of a

00:44:57.757 --> 00:45:01.599
sociologist named Ralf
Dahrendorf,

00:45:01.599 --> 00:45:04.639
economist sociologist who died
just a few weeks ago,

00:45:04.639 --> 00:45:08.969
and Dahrendorf's point,
which I'm sure is true,

00:45:08.969 --> 00:45:13.617
is that you can generate
classes around any process of

00:45:13.617 --> 00:45:16.250
production and distribution.
 

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:22.829
There is nothing final about
the proletariat coming to power,

00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:27.931
and there is never a time in
human history when we'll be done

00:45:27.931 --> 00:45:33.032
with the possibility that those
who control the direct levers

00:45:33.032 --> 00:45:37.030
control them not to the benefit
of others,

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:38.518
but to the benefit of
themselves.

00:45:38.518 --> 00:45:43.793
Francis Fukayama,
who famously wrote a book

00:45:43.793 --> 00:45:46.346
called--
that had the punch line:

00:45:46.346 --> 00:45:50.057
The end of history--
after the Cold War ended--his

00:45:50.057 --> 00:45:53.969
view was that capitalist
democracy became,

00:45:53.969 --> 00:45:59.460
"the end of history,"
the unchangeable endpoint,

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.500
and of course that's not true.
 

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:06.077
The course of history is not,
contrary to Marx,

00:46:06.077 --> 00:46:07.469
determinate.
 

00:46:07.469 --> 00:46:11.820
Marx was not only wrong about
his own ability to understand

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:16.340
the course of future history,
he was wrong about the very

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:21.054
concept that there could be a
deterministic theory which told

00:46:21.054 --> 00:46:24.590
us what was going to happen in
the future.

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:29.778
This guy, Schumpeter,
who, I know you hate the way he

00:46:29.778 --> 00:46:34.768
writes, but he understood that
point profoundly.

00:46:34.768 --> 00:46:37.695
I'm out of time so I'm not
going to elaborate him,

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:40.619
I'll do it at the beginning of
class next time.

00:46:40.619 --> 00:46:47.369
The guy who comes to center
stage next time is F.A.

00:46:47.369 --> 00:46:50.860
Hayek, whose most famous book
was called,

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:52.139
The Constitution of
Liberty,

00:46:52.139 --> 00:46:56.976
and who believed that a market
society had within it the

00:46:56.976 --> 00:47:01.110
capacity for enormous creativity
and growth,

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:05.400
and we'll examine that in class
on Wednesday.

00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:10.000

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.141
Prof: What I'd like to
do this morning is spend eight

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:09.103
or ten minutes with a few slides
that are framing and background

00:00:09.103 --> 00:00:10.110
to the case.
 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:17.330
And then I'm going to ask Nancy
Hite to impersonate Sharon

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.710
Oster,
with the flying chalk on the

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.042
board,
and I'm going to come around

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:25.400
and talk to all of you about the
case.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.070
And we'll work it through B
school style.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.625
When you look at the
institutions involved in the

00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:41.524
mortgage system,
don't assume that they were

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:47.357
designed brilliantly,
or that they were thought out

00:00:47.357 --> 00:00:49.750
from beginning to end.
 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.131
The concept of
"kluge,"

00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:54.290
is that in your vocabulary?
 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.310
Tim, is that,
"kluge,"

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.917
is that a-- hands up if
"kluge"

00:00:58.917 --> 00:00:59.960
is familiar.
 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.899
I'm not going to get anywhere
with that idea.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.311
"Kluge"
means things that are complex

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:08.870
and badly designed.
 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.061
And there's a wonderful book by
Gary Marcus called Kluge,

00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:19.156
which is about badly
designed stuff,

00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:24.590
from economic institutions;
to human memory;

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:32.010
to the human spine,
which is a highly error-prone

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.670
structure,
and is as it is not

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.393
because evolution said,
"What's the very best

00:01:43.393 --> 00:01:48.160
support column I can make for a
bipedal creature?"

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.242
but, "What's the best I
can do by evolving from a

00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:55.709
four-legged to a two-legged
creature?"

00:01:55.709 --> 00:02:00.978
And the spine shows all kinds
of design imperfections that are

00:02:00.978 --> 00:02:06.248
attributable to the fact that it
evolved in a horizontal plain

00:02:06.248 --> 00:02:10.310
and then was readapted in a
vertical plain.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.419
And the institutions at play
in, what Posner calls the

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:22.002
Depression of '08,
and what most of us call the

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:25.504
Recession of 08/'09,
though it is,

00:02:25.504 --> 00:02:28.628
perhaps, the mother of all
recessions,

00:02:28.628 --> 00:02:34.579
it has not actually obtained
the depth of unemployment and

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:40.738
under-utilization of plant and
equipment that would match up

00:02:40.738 --> 00:02:43.870
with the one in the 1930s.
 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.310
Of course, we could still get
there.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:55.485
It is possible that it is now
1931 and another dip is out

00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:56.940
there.
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.449
I don't think that but there
are those, including Will

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:04.687
Goetzmann, who we saw a few days
ago, who speculate that it might

00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:05.348
be so.
 

00:03:05.348 --> 00:03:15.639
This is a cast of characters
for subprime lending;

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:18.712
left to right:
the homebuyer,

00:03:18.712 --> 00:03:20.810
the broker,
the appraiser,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.712
the mortgage lender,
the investment banker and the

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:27.620
investors in the bonds created
by the investment banks.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.854
And in the row I'm touching are
the principal incentives that

00:03:35.854 --> 00:03:39.560
make the whole system go.
 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.520
And the critical thing is that
three,

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.565
and arguably four,
of the main steps in the

00:03:50.565 --> 00:03:56.717
process are fee-driven,
so that the alignment between

00:03:56.717 --> 00:04:02.310
the decision maker and the
investor,

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.020
or between the decision maker
and the potential home buyer,

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.318
may be muted by the decision
maker thinking "fees."

00:04:14.318 --> 00:04:20.428
If I'm thinking--let's suppose
I were a college admissions

00:04:20.428 --> 00:04:26.752
officer and I was paid by the
live students delivered to the

00:04:26.752 --> 00:04:31.620
school,
I might become very generous in

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.848
my view;
I might find creativity in

00:04:34.848 --> 00:04:38.476
unexpected places;
I might imagine analytic

00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:41.009
firepower where none existed.
 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.495
And so, in all these steps,
the bias toward

00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:50.194
"yes,"
the bias toward completing a

00:04:50.194 --> 00:04:56.634
transaction,
is a very powerful piece of the

00:04:56.634 --> 00:04:57.680
story.
 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.269
The risks are chartered here.
 

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:03.009
What we're going to do,
when we do the case,

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.259
among other things,
is to fill in the bottom row.

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.096
What are the ways in which we
would expect people in each of

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:14.949
these roles to be tempted to get
out of line?

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.877
Out of line ethically;
and quite possibly out of line

00:05:19.877 --> 00:05:20.610
legally.
 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.690
As in the case,
there is a broker,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.199
right, who gets way beyond both
ethical and legal bounds.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:35.555
Home ownership in the United
States, 1900 to 2000,

00:05:35.555 --> 00:05:37.889
looks like this.
 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:40.747
And notice it's a truncated
scale, the bottom of the scale

00:05:40.747 --> 00:05:41.699
is forty percent.
 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:47.901
The big story is a huge
normative emphasis on home

00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:49.420
ownership.
 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:56.319
The belief, going back to
Jefferson really,

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:01.464
that when people own property
they become "bought-in

00:06:01.464 --> 00:06:05.935
citizens",
citizens who identify with the

00:06:05.935 --> 00:06:10.346
Commonwealth and who can be
counted on to act in

00:06:10.346 --> 00:06:12.600
public-spirited ways.
 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:20.228
And there's a great run-up in
home ownership between World War

00:06:20.228 --> 00:06:25.257
II and the 1980s,
and it is fuelled by very

00:06:25.257 --> 00:06:30.209
profitable mass development of
suburban housing;

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:41.190
it is financed by FHA and
related government entities;

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:46.733
and it is rewarded by the
Internal Revenue Service tax

00:06:46.733 --> 00:06:52.800
code, which gives a strong
incentive for people to take out

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.879
mortgages on a principal
residence.

00:06:56.879 --> 00:07:04.055
Now, home ownership,
I assume--do any of you own a

00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:05.079
home?
 

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:12.031
Oh, I should say that Jaan
Elias, who wrote the case,

00:07:12.031 --> 00:07:13.769
is with us.
 

00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:15.980
Welcome Jaan.
 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.589
Jaan Elias: Hello.
 

00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:18.459
Prof: Do you own a house?
 

00:07:18.459 --> 00:07:20.560
Jan Elias: No.
 

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.480
Prof: Sometimes I envy
that.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.189
Home ownership has all kinds of
hazards.

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:32.221
I just learned that my slate
roof, a hundred year old slate

00:07:32.221 --> 00:07:35.519
roof, is at the end of its
lifetime.

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:41.935
And that's comparable to buying
a--it's about the same price as

00:07:41.935 --> 00:07:46.800
the highest-end BMW,
to replace a slate roof;

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.509
that's a hazard.
 

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:56.440
Suppose that you get laid-off;
your mortgage payments continue.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.990
Suppose that there is a
catastrophic illness;

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.521
the mortgage payments continue,
the local property taxes

00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:09.300
continue, the unanticipated
maintenance issues continue.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.009
And there is quite a lot to be
said for relative caution about

00:08:15.009 --> 00:08:20.156
undertaking a debt amounting to
several years' income in

00:08:20.156 --> 00:08:22.310
purchasing a house.
 

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.899
Now, there's also a political
dimension to this,

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:34.035
which is that the old fashioned
local banking method of writing

00:08:34.035 --> 00:08:39.808
mortgages was extremely cautious
and was,

00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:43.264
first explicitly and then,
later, implicitly racist and

00:08:43.264 --> 00:08:44.798
"genderist."
 

00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:50.129
It was all about well-employed
white men.

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:57.529
And there is an ideological
strand,

00:08:57.529 --> 00:09:00.278
that is not Jeffersonian but is
more recent,

00:09:00.278 --> 00:09:03.399
and has to do with equality of
opportunity to own houses,

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:09.649
which has pushed policy towards
are more permissive attitude.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:14.519
Finally, there is,
of course, the pro-market view,

00:09:14.519 --> 00:09:17.894
which became dominant in this
country in the Ronald Reagan

00:09:17.894 --> 00:09:20.937
era,
which says "Let people cut

00:09:20.937 --> 00:09:23.308
the deals they want to cut.
 

00:09:23.308 --> 00:09:25.960
Get the government out of the
transaction.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.558
Deregulate."
 

00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:31.470
And in many cases deregulation
was a spectacular success,

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.751
for example,
the airline industry,

00:09:34.751 --> 00:09:40.336
the trucking industry,
but deregulation of finance is

00:09:40.336 --> 00:09:43.019
a slipperier undertaking.
 

00:09:43.019 --> 00:09:48.129
A history of home values here.
 

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:54.024
It's an index chart that has
1890 indexed to 100 and the gist

00:09:54.024 --> 00:09:59.328
of the argument in this
chart--did I take this from the

00:09:59.328 --> 00:10:01.000
case, or not?
 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.980
Jan Elias: No. 
Prof: The gist of the

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:07.836
argument in this chart is that:
by the time we are done with

00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:10.568
the current meltdown,
home values,

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:15.004
adjusted for inflation,
will be back about where they

00:10:15.004 --> 00:10:16.039
were in 1890.
 

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:25.710
 
 

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:30.480
This is a map of Philadelphia,
and it's a historically

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.100
interesting map.
 

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.682
I couldn't find a comparable
one for Cleveland,

00:10:34.682 --> 00:10:36.308
though I'm sure one exists.
 

00:10:36.308 --> 00:10:44.250
In 1937 mortgages were
collapsing all over the country.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:47.774
And the Roosevelt
Administration pushed through

00:10:47.774 --> 00:10:52.216
Congress a piece of legislation
called The Home Owners Loan

00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:55.355
Corporation,
HOLC, Home Owners Loan

00:10:55.355 --> 00:10:56.440
Corporation.
 

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:59.808
And the Home Owners Loan
Corporation was charged with

00:10:59.808 --> 00:11:03.243
finding out how to know in
advance if a mortgage would

00:11:03.243 --> 00:11:04.278
likely fail.
 

00:11:04.278 --> 00:11:10.633
And the technique was not to
look at credit scores but to

00:11:10.633 --> 00:11:17.299
look at housing locations;
and to look at the condition of

00:11:17.299 --> 00:11:22.669
housing in a neighborhood;
and at the demographics of who

00:11:22.669 --> 00:11:23.678
lived there.
 

00:11:23.678 --> 00:11:29.721
And it was crudely racist and
biased in many,

00:11:29.721 --> 00:11:31.370
many ways.
 

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:35.990
It was explicitly racist about
blacks;

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.860
it was explicitly racist about
Jews;

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:44.398
it was explicitly racist about
Italians, most of all Southern

00:11:44.398 --> 00:11:45.230
Italians.
 

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:52.075
And it was a four-point scale,
the worst category - level D -

00:11:52.075 --> 00:11:54.052
was red,
and the term

00:11:54.052 --> 00:11:56.460
"redlining"
comes from this,

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:00.349
and the idea was to tell the
banking world not to lend money

00:12:00.349 --> 00:12:01.470
in those zones.
 

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:07.460
Yellow was a little better,
then blue,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:14.580
then green and the idea was to
put mortgage money into the

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.205
safest,
wealthiest neighborhoods with

00:12:18.205 --> 00:12:20.990
the most homogeneous
populations.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:27.076
And from the point of view of
managing the mortgage crisis,

00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:30.330
it was not a terrible policy.
 

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:35.538
From the point of view of
managing cities and communities,

00:12:35.538 --> 00:12:40.376
it was catastrophic because
what it did was to accelerate

00:12:40.376 --> 00:12:45.041
the creation of slums in areas
where mortgage money was

00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:49.620
unavailable for the sale or
purchase of housing,

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.932
or, for that matter,
for the large-scale repair of

00:12:52.932 --> 00:12:53.610
housing.
 

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.690
They did it to two
hundred--they did the process to

00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:02.423
two hundred American cities in a
single year, including New

00:13:02.423 --> 00:13:03.240
Haven.
 

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.450
Across Chapel Street is class D.
 

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:16.144
This is the Case-Schiller home
prices story and let's lay it

00:13:16.144 --> 00:13:22.389
out here from the year 2000 to
2007.

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:27.082
And this is,
when Goetzmann talked about

00:13:27.082 --> 00:13:32.860
Case-Schiller being a reassuring
data series,

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:37.330
if you look at it between here
and here,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:40.690
if you look at a five-year
period or even a six-year

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:44.101
period,
it looks like a process of

00:13:44.101 --> 00:13:48.230
continued appreciation in home
prices.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:53.162
And there was nothing in the
data, that would have,

00:13:53.162 --> 00:13:59.278
given conventional econometric
models, would have triggered the

00:13:59.278 --> 00:14:02.830
suspicion that the end was nigh.
 

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:10.360
The chart is also interesting
because Cleveland is this line.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:17.013
So that, Cleveland is a less
extreme story in price

00:14:17.013 --> 00:14:23.533
appreciation than the cases
everybody talks about,

00:14:23.533 --> 00:14:30.320
which were Miami and Las Vegas
and Los Angeles.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:37.693
This is the same story shown in
year-on-year percentage change

00:14:37.693 --> 00:14:43.616
and it actually doesn't add much
to our knowledge,

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:46.639
I'm going to skip it.
 

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:57.371
This is Cleveland price
appreciation from 2000 into

00:14:57.371 --> 00:15:01.298
2007,
compared with the country at

00:15:01.298 --> 00:15:06.937
large,
and the gist is that Cleveland

00:15:06.937 --> 00:15:11.389
was not a hot--
not a hot city.

00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:16.690
And it was--it is in that
respect, I hope I've got--I've

00:15:16.690 --> 00:15:18.808
missed a chart here.
 

00:15:18.808 --> 00:15:24.249
There's a huge story about
Northeastern industrial cities,

00:15:24.249 --> 00:15:28.830
by which I mean virtually all
the cities from St.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:34.080
Louis on the left side to
Boston on the right side.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:41.567
They all had their take-off in
the middle of the nineteenth

00:15:41.567 --> 00:15:42.860
century.
 

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:51.192
They were all going almost
vertical in the years 1850 to

00:15:51.192 --> 00:15:53.009
1900,1910.
 

00:15:53.009 --> 00:16:01.580
By 1920 their growth rates
slowed down almost to zero,

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:08.110
and were-- fluctuated wildly
during the Depression years,

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:13.070
recovered briefly in World War
II, and then went sharply south

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:14.288
from 1950 on.
 

00:16:14.288 --> 00:16:19.351
New Haven's case,
the strength of the inner city

00:16:19.351 --> 00:16:23.658
economy forms an almost perfect
arch,

00:16:23.658 --> 00:16:28.549
with the starting point in
1840, the peak in 1950,

00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:32.000
and the bottom in about 1990.
 

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.080
And there's actually been a
little bit of recovery since.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.230
But Cleveland is a classic
industrial city.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:43.513
It is the place where Standard
Oil set up its first large

00:16:43.513 --> 00:16:44.889
refining plants.
 

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:50.985
It was an advantage-point in
transportation because it was an

00:16:50.985 --> 00:16:57.082
intersection between very high
quality east-west freight rail

00:16:57.082 --> 00:17:00.028
and Great Lakes shipping.
 

00:17:00.028 --> 00:17:04.916
And when rail became
subordinated to trucking and

00:17:04.916 --> 00:17:10.824
when suburban development became
dominant over the reuse of

00:17:10.824 --> 00:17:16.920
industrial urban neighborhoods,
Cleveland suffered mightily.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:24.190
This income map of Cleveland,
where medium incomes,

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:30.442
under $22,700,
are shown in the darkest rust

00:17:30.442 --> 00:17:36.259
tone, is where the case takes
place;

00:17:36.259 --> 00:17:41.269
the green dot is approximately
the location of Slavic Village.

00:17:41.269 --> 00:17:45.449
I wouldn't swear to it or argue
with Jaan if he said move it

00:17:45.449 --> 00:17:49.557
three or four degrees of the
compass north or east or south

00:17:49.557 --> 00:17:51.548
or west,
but it's right about there.

00:17:51.548 --> 00:17:58.673
And it is on the edge of a
large post-industrial working

00:17:58.673 --> 00:18:03.855
class neighborhood,
or mega-neighborhood,

00:18:03.855 --> 00:18:08.390
in a declining industrial city.
 

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.568
So, there's the great arch.
 

00:18:12.568 --> 00:18:16.834
And the concentration of
subprime lending in Cleveland,

00:18:16.834 --> 00:18:21.334
shown in the darkest tones
here, includes the neighborhood

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:23.230
we're talking about.
 

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:27.980
And then there's Posner.
 

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:33.321
On page 284,
I hope all of you have

00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:38.823
memorized page 284,
where he's apportioning blame:

00:18:38.823 --> 00:18:42.160
"But although the
financiers bear the primary

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.815
responsibility for the
depression,"

00:18:44.815 --> 00:18:47.538
that's his name for the
recession,

00:18:47.538 --> 00:18:53.519
"I do not think they can
be blamed for it,

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:57.053
implying moral censure,
any more than one can blame a

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.819
lion for eating a zebra.
 

00:18:58.819 --> 00:19:01.369
Capitalism is Darwinism."
 

00:19:01.369 --> 00:19:07.349
Pretty dark interpretation.
 

00:19:07.349 --> 00:19:46.819
&gt;
 

00:19:46.819 --> 00:19:48.420
Prof: Is it Jennifer?
 

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.920
Student: Yes.
 

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:50.233
Prof.
 

00:19:50.233 --> 00:19:51.883
Douglas W. Rae:
That's the trouble with

00:19:51.883 --> 00:19:54.519
letting me learn your name;
you get cold called.

00:19:54.519 --> 00:19:59.944
There's a story in this where a
local broker ends up being

00:19:59.944 --> 00:20:02.038
sentenced to prison.
 

00:20:02.038 --> 00:20:03.859
Do you remember that part of it
or not?

00:20:03.859 --> 00:20:05.759
Student: Mark.
 

00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:07.940
Prof: Okay, Mark.
 

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.318
Can you give us a little recap
on Mark?

00:20:09.318 --> 00:20:12.525
Student:
Mark Kellogg submitted

00:20:12.525 --> 00:20:16.250
fraudulent data for about
seventy homes,

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.940
and--or somehow ended up,
I'm not sure of the process of

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.085
flipping a house exactly,
but he did it to seventy homes

00:20:24.085 --> 00:20:27.710
and they all ended up defaulting
on the loans,

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.838
the people that he sold it to.
 

00:20:29.838 --> 00:20:33.660
Prof: Okay,
so Mark's sin would be what?

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.788
Let's try somebody else.
 

00:20:36.788 --> 00:20:42.375
What's Mark--if Mark were a
relative of yours and you had to

00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:47.770
have Thanksgiving dinner with
him while he was on furlough

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:54.313
from Ohio State Penitentiary,
what topic would you want it to

00:20:54.313 --> 00:21:01.990
reflect on;
ethical topic?

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:09.278
You want to take a shot at this?
 

00:21:09.278 --> 00:21:13.532
Student:
Perhaps, as you just mentioned

00:21:13.532 --> 00:21:17.220
with the topic of preying on
zebras,

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:21.278
perhaps something like that,
and that--

00:21:21.278 --> 00:21:27.519
using a position to benefit
from people at a much

00:21:27.519 --> 00:21:31.028
&gt;
 

00:21:31.028 --> 00:21:33.480
than you, and to their
detriment and to your gain.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:33.890
Prof: Okay.
 

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:35.690
So the buyers,
on your telling,

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:36.470
are zebras.
 

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:43.259
Okay, that's a plausible
position.

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:48.012
If the buyers are zebras,
are the zebras in any way

00:21:48.012 --> 00:21:50.390
blamable in this story?
 

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:56.009
What do you think?
 

00:21:56.009 --> 00:21:59.228
Student:
It's possible that they're

00:21:59.228 --> 00:22:02.140
blamable,
if they were given good

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:04.704
information,
but in this situation they were

00:22:04.704 --> 00:22:07.127
given completely wrongful
information and led to believe

00:22:07.127 --> 00:22:08.009
that it was true.
 

00:22:08.009 --> 00:22:10.019
Prof: Okay.
 

00:22:10.019 --> 00:22:11.932
Student:
Like, a plausible person would

00:22:11.932 --> 00:22:12.568
believe that.
 

00:22:12.568 --> 00:22:16.999
Prof: Can we tell a
story where it's plausible to

00:22:16.999 --> 00:22:18.529
blame the buyers?
 

00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:20.470
Student: Yes.
 

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:25.141
Where they should have known
that they don't have the income

00:22:25.141 --> 00:22:29.098
to pay the loan and they were
going to default,

00:22:29.098 --> 00:22:32.420
and so therefore they should
have not bought the home.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.970
Prof: Thank you.
 

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:39.127
And are their instances where
people are encouraged to lie

00:22:39.127 --> 00:22:41.118
about their incomes?
 

00:22:41.118 --> 00:22:44.442
Student:
I think there's a big problem

00:22:44.442 --> 00:22:48.597
with a lot of these "Jumbo
Subprime Mortgages"

00:22:48.597 --> 00:22:51.618
they called them,
where people were buying really

00:22:51.618 --> 00:22:53.046
big houses,
or second houses,

00:22:53.046 --> 00:22:56.118
with subprime mortgages and in
that case it is their fault,

00:22:56.118 --> 00:22:57.710
because they were just being
greedy,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:22:58.848
right.
 

00:22:58.848 --> 00:23:01.971
And trying to take--trying to
either falsify documents or go

00:23:01.971 --> 00:23:05.250
for the type of loans that would
allow them to get these second

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:08.319
properties without really having
enough to back it up.

00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:10.890
Prof: Okay.
 

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:15.695
So, that's the sin of pride or
gluttony, not really gluttony,

00:23:15.695 --> 00:23:18.740
but it's bricks and mortar
gluttony.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.250
Yes?
 

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:24.259
Student:
Well there were also NINJA

00:23:24.259 --> 00:23:26.390
loans,
which I think is a very

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:29.460
appropriate acronym because of
the sneakiness,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:31.799
but it was an acronym for no
income,

00:23:31.799 --> 00:23:33.170
no job and no assets.
 

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.358
Professor Douglas W.
 

00:23:34.358 --> 00:23:35.776
Rae: Okay,
NINJA: No Income,

00:23:35.776 --> 00:23:36.690
No Job, No Assets.
 

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:44.679
And why would anyone encourage
another human being to seek a

00:23:44.679 --> 00:23:46.440
NINJA loan?
 

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.920
Is it obvious?
 

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.784
Student:
Well, if you're one of the

00:23:52.784 --> 00:23:57.779
three steps that profits off of
the fee of making--

00:23:57.779 --> 00:24:00.588
of having that loan go through,
then you don't even--

00:24:00.588 --> 00:24:02.028
it doesn't really matter to you
if it--

00:24:02.028 --> 00:24:04.957
or it doesn't matter to you if
it defaults as much as it

00:24:04.957 --> 00:24:06.980
matters to the buyer or to the
bank.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.470
Prof: Okay.
 

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.912
So as long as you can
successfully pass it along to

00:24:11.912 --> 00:24:14.941
the next step,
you collect the fee and you're

00:24:14.941 --> 00:24:17.420
home-dry no matter what happens.
 

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:18.926
Student:
Right, and your reputation

00:24:18.926 --> 00:24:19.920
&gt;
 

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.179
..
 

00:24:20.179 --> 00:24:26.920
Prof: Okay now,
let's stop and see what we got

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.940
for a diagram here,
Sharon.

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:33.930
Student:
&gt;

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:36.000
Prof: Unpack your
diagram.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.048
Student:
Okay, so I guess this is...

00:24:37.048 --> 00:24:38.640
Prof: I knew you'd be
good at diagrams.

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.710
Student:
Our game of Pictionary.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.130
So, I'm trying to map out what
exactly went wrong,

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:48.519
and I would start with a home
in the Slavic community and then

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:50.714
I would end,
maybe, here with Bank of

00:24:50.714 --> 00:24:51.180
Scotland.
 

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:58.643
And between "Joe six
pack" purchasing a home

00:24:58.643 --> 00:25:05.612
with a $22,000 yearly income,
which was the average I saw,

00:25:05.612 --> 00:25:10.536
that was misrepresented as
being worth about $80,000 from

00:25:10.536 --> 00:25:15.827
the broker who works with a--
I figured we could have

00:25:15.827 --> 00:25:19.598
everyone fill in the parts for
me.

00:25:19.598 --> 00:25:23.685
Like, how do we get from the
home to the international

00:25:23.685 --> 00:25:24.380
crisis?
 

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:30.278
Prof: Okay,
so who's &lt;&lt;technical

00:25:30.278 --> 00:25:32.288
chat&gt;&gt;.
 

00:25:32.288 --> 00:25:38.190
What's the next step in the
chain to the right of broker?

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:41.913
Student:
Probably someone will give a

00:25:41.913 --> 00:25:46.934
rating for this mortgage so that
the broker will be able to

00:25:46.934 --> 00:25:52.044
package it with other mortgages
and sell it to an investment

00:25:52.044 --> 00:25:53.170
banker.
 

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.330
Prof: Okay,
so there's a credit rating

00:25:55.330 --> 00:25:58.278
story, but there's also another
story that's closer to ground

00:25:58.278 --> 00:25:58.769
level.
 

00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:07.548
It concerns the house itself.
 

00:26:07.548 --> 00:26:10.136
Student:
Need an evaluation of the

00:26:10.136 --> 00:26:12.660
house, like, what the house
value is.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.160
Prof: Okay.
 

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.971
And there's a saying in real
estate "appraise as

00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:20.730
instructed."
 

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:30.461
And it's not altogether false
that whoever hires--think about

00:26:30.461 --> 00:26:33.220
the incentives.
 

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.461
You're an appraiser,
and Paul here hires you to do

00:26:37.461 --> 00:26:42.654
an appraisal and you're going to
get a fee of 1,100 bucks for

00:26:42.654 --> 00:26:43.779
doing it.
 

00:26:43.779 --> 00:26:48.626
And Paul lets it be known that
he thinks this house really

00:26:48.626 --> 00:26:52.710
ought to be worth something
north of $200,000.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:56.470
And you go out in the field,
do the comparables and the

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.558
number comes up at $140,000.
 

00:26:58.558 --> 00:27:04.240
Tim, what thought might cross
your mind if you were--I

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:09.278
understand in your case it,
of course, wouldn't,

00:27:09.278 --> 00:27:11.960
but in, say,
my case?

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.107
Student:
It might cross your mind to

00:27:14.107 --> 00:27:16.819
trust all and just go with the
$200,000 prediction.

00:27:16.819 --> 00:27:18.900
Prof: Okay.
 

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.288
And the second step in the
reasoning is?

00:27:21.288 --> 00:27:24.009
Student:
No-one will ever know.

00:27:24.009 --> 00:27:27.372
Prof: No-one will ever
know and next time Paul goes to

00:27:27.372 --> 00:27:29.390
the Yellow Pages for an
appraisal?

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:31.000
Student:
He'll come to you.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.279
Prof: He'll come to you
or he's more likely to.

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:36.470
He's a damn sight less likely
to if you undercut his deal.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:39.963
I'll tell you a Yale story
about appraisals:

00:27:39.963 --> 00:27:44.758
when I was in city government
we leased High Street and Wall

00:27:44.758 --> 00:27:48.089
Street to Yale for ninety-nine
years;

00:27:48.089 --> 00:27:50.348
we were broke, we needed money.
 

00:27:50.348 --> 00:27:57.299
And the Mayor sat down with
Benno Schmidt,

00:27:57.299 --> 00:28:01.945
and Benno said, "Well,
the University will handle the

00:28:01.945 --> 00:28:04.578
appraisal for you,"
and they did.

00:28:04.578 --> 00:28:08.275
The two streets together leased
for one million dollars for

00:28:08.275 --> 00:28:09.548
ninety-nine years.
 

00:28:09.548 --> 00:28:15.641
It should have been a lot more
than that and there were those,

00:28:15.641 --> 00:28:20.433
in city government,
who thought I was the guy who

00:28:20.433 --> 00:28:23.230
got the number that low.
 

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:27.567
I was actually pulling hard on
making the number at least one

00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:30.098
zero or a zero-and-a-half
higher.

00:28:30.098 --> 00:28:33.474
I'd allow the Law School to
build that gorgeous underground

00:28:33.474 --> 00:28:36.910
library, because the ground
rights went with the streets.

00:28:36.910 --> 00:28:41.680
And so "appraise as
instructed"

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:46.690
is an important component in
this story.

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:51.250
We had the appraiser there.
 

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:58.809
So, who else is involved and
what are their incentives?

00:28:58.809 --> 00:29:10.788
Paul?
 

00:29:10.788 --> 00:29:13.021
Student:
Well, you've got the local bank

00:29:13.021 --> 00:29:14.769
that's actually doing the
lending.

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:16.328
Prof: Okay.
 

00:29:16.328 --> 00:29:19.092
Student:
And they probably will get a

00:29:19.092 --> 00:29:23.138
fee for the loan that they take
and then if they can package and

00:29:23.138 --> 00:29:26.961
sell it off to someone else,
they don't end up with the loan

00:29:26.961 --> 00:29:30.230
on their books so they couldn't,
probably, care less how it

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:31.740
performs over the long run.
 

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:32.910
Prof: Okay.
 

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:37.417
So--terrific,
so, the lender is also

00:29:37.417 --> 00:29:45.145
fee-driven and is inclined to
think that she or he can escape

00:29:45.145 --> 00:29:51.200
accountability when the property
defaults,

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.269
if it defaults.
 

00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:55.048
And why would that be?
 

00:29:55.048 --> 00:29:58.398
What are the--what do we turn
these loans into at the next

00:29:58.398 --> 00:29:58.868
stage?
 

00:29:58.868 --> 00:30:04.172
Student:
Usually it's sold off to a big

00:30:04.172 --> 00:30:11.358
investment bank or basically a
financial powerhouse where they

00:30:11.358 --> 00:30:16.190
pull the mortgages into these
giant,

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:20.778
collateralized debt obligations
or &gt;

00:30:20.778 --> 00:30:23.009
Prof: Okay,
CDOs, famous acronym.

00:30:23.009 --> 00:30:24.529
Do you want to add anything to
this?

00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.779
Jaan Elias: Not really.
 

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:25.618
Prof: Okay.
 

00:30:25.618 --> 00:30:30.808
So you've got the banks
creating these huge bundles,

00:30:30.808 --> 00:30:36.737
and the bundles--what story
could you tell to say that

00:30:36.737 --> 00:30:43.446
bundling these mortgages from
all across the country might be

00:30:43.446 --> 00:30:49.039
a good thing from the economy's
point of view.

00:30:49.039 --> 00:30:52.569
Is there anything you could say?
 

00:30:52.569 --> 00:30:56.960
 
 

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.213
Student:
It diversifies the risk for

00:30:58.213 --> 00:30:59.170
those who are taking them out.
 

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:00.160
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.578
It diversifies the risk,
say a little more.

00:31:02.578 --> 00:31:04.282
Student:
Well, presumably,

00:31:04.282 --> 00:31:07.528
the people who are packaging
them can take out a bunch of--

00:31:07.528 --> 00:31:11.974
do a lot of financial analysis
and determine that the risk of

00:31:11.974 --> 00:31:16.420
the number of defaults would be
lower than the benefit of the

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.680
people actually paying their
loans back.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.721
So, the people who take out the
package would have a favorable

00:31:22.721 --> 00:31:23.420
risk return.
 

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.868
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:24.868 --> 00:31:26.720
And part--were you about to say
something?

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.175
Student:
I think it also increase the

00:31:29.175 --> 00:31:31.553
market of potential buyers,
because now,

00:31:31.553 --> 00:31:34.593
rather than owning a mortgage
and having to deal with an

00:31:34.593 --> 00:31:37.154
investor one-on-one,
you have a pooling and

00:31:37.154 --> 00:31:40.243
servicing agreement that has a
company as a servicer who

00:31:40.243 --> 00:31:43.444
handles all the collection of
payments and distribution of

00:31:43.444 --> 00:31:45.579
money into different
investments.

00:31:45.579 --> 00:31:46.700
Prof: Okay.
 

00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.737
So, you've got an institutional
mechanism that makes this work

00:31:50.737 --> 00:31:55.473
relatively smoothly,
and you're interested,

00:31:55.473 --> 00:32:02.761
when you create these bundles,
in having the risks have

00:32:02.761 --> 00:32:07.660
relatively low correlation with
one another.

00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:13.695
What would be a bad bundle is
one where we can know that some

00:32:13.695 --> 00:32:19.230
of the mortgages are defaulting
and infer from that,

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.088
that lots of others are likely
to default.

00:32:22.088 --> 00:32:25.640
And a bundle that was
geographically concentrated,

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:29.316
on Slavic Village for example,
would have that second

00:32:29.316 --> 00:32:32.640
characteristic and that would be
a bad thing.

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:41.548
So, there is a story about risk
management that makes that work.

00:32:41.548 --> 00:32:45.690
Now, are the agencies,
like Moody's,

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:50.890
these outfits that judge
credit-worthiness of companies

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.549
and other financial
intermediaries,

00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:56.548
are they in this story anywhere?
 

00:32:56.548 --> 00:32:59.790
I don't know if they--Jaan,
does Moody's get into your

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:00.220
case?
 

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:01.509
I don't think I found it.
 

00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:04.700
Jaan Elias:
Just as a kind of footnote.

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.859
There are bating the CDOs.
 

00:33:06.859 --> 00:33:10.548
Prof: Okay.
 

00:33:10.548 --> 00:33:12.500
So, everybody know what Moody's
and its rivals do?

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:36.490
Anybody want to help us with
that?

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:37.990
Student:
Moody's and its rivals are--

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:41.621
essentially collect a fee from
anyone who wants to spin-off an

00:33:41.621 --> 00:33:45.133
asset or a debt obligation to
actually rate the soundness of

00:33:45.133 --> 00:33:48.108
the security for whatever it's
supposed to be.

00:33:48.108 --> 00:33:50.920
They sign a rating like Triple
A or Single A.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.130
Prof: Okay.
 

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:55.792
And if I'm--Yale was Triple A,
and I think we're now Double A,

00:33:55.792 --> 00:34:00.608
what's a Triple A--what's the
advantage of a Triple A rating?

00:34:00.608 --> 00:34:02.980
Student:
If you have a higher rating

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.028
then that means you can get a
lower cost of capital.

00:34:06.028 --> 00:34:08.782
So, if you actually want to
raise some money you can raise

00:34:08.782 --> 00:34:10.860
it for a lot less--a lower
interest rate.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.552
Prof: So,
it reduces the cost of capital,

00:34:13.552 --> 00:34:15.960
and it therefore has great
value to you.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:21.447
Now, if you could bribe
Moody's, if you were completely

00:34:21.447 --> 00:34:27.344
amoral and you could bribe
Moody's to make something Triple

00:34:27.344 --> 00:34:33.795
A when it was really B,
it would be worth paying a lot,

00:34:33.795 --> 00:34:34.610
right?
 

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:40.690
The actual economic value of
those ratings is huge.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:53.768
What keeps Moody's honest?
 

00:34:53.768 --> 00:34:55.610
Student:
Their reputation;

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:59.248
the fact that they have,
for years, made sure that the

00:34:59.248 --> 00:35:03.369
ratings that they're giving are
actually safe investments.

00:35:03.369 --> 00:35:04.860
Prof: Okay.
 

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.467
And in general,
people on the buy side are

00:35:08.467 --> 00:35:13.217
going to want the rating
agencies to tell the truth and

00:35:13.217 --> 00:35:18.409
people on the sell side will be
ambivalent about that,

00:35:18.409 --> 00:35:23.030
so there are cross-pressures
there.

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:29.829
And there is patent evidence of
great inflation in the ratings

00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:32.840
that these firms produce.
 

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:41.989
Does that surprise you, Paul?
 

00:35:41.989 --> 00:35:42.994
Student:
Not really, no,

00:35:42.994 --> 00:35:45.039
because they get paid by the
sell side not by the buy side.

00:35:45.039 --> 00:35:46.599
Prof: Absolutely.
 

00:35:46.599 --> 00:35:50.978
So, they are doing--they are,
in a sense, appraising as

00:35:50.978 --> 00:35:56.170
instructed and that's a pretty
scary part of this whole thing.

00:35:56.170 --> 00:36:05.760
Let's reach all the way back to
Adam Smith for a minute,

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.929
and Smith's story,
not just of the invisible hand,

00:36:09.929 --> 00:36:14.429
but of the generally benign
working of markets.

00:36:14.429 --> 00:36:21.762
In everything Smith says is
embedded a basic norm of truth

00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:29.610
that I'm not selling you a false
mirage of a loaf of bread;

00:36:29.610 --> 00:36:31.590
I'm selling you an actual loaf
of bread.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:37.809
I'm not selling you coffee or a
substance that looks like

00:36:37.809 --> 00:36:40.179
coffee;
I'm selling you coffee.

00:36:40.179 --> 00:36:44.619
And the basic accountability in
bilateral trade,

00:36:44.619 --> 00:36:47.744
where you're buying something
from me or I'm buying something

00:36:47.744 --> 00:36:50.434
from you,
we keep each other honest,

00:36:50.434 --> 00:36:50.989
right?
 

00:36:50.989 --> 00:36:54.635
Where it's two parties and
there's no information

00:36:54.635 --> 00:36:56.079
asymmetry, right?
 

00:36:56.079 --> 00:36:59.340
Where there are two parties
with symmetrical information.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:04.172
The most foundational aspect of
a market system is that buyer

00:37:04.172 --> 00:37:08.360
and seller are equipped to keep
each other honest.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.190
And where there is a huge
information asymmetry,

00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:20.242
we invent things like Moody's
or appraisals of real estate as

00:37:20.242 --> 00:37:24.940
a substitute,
a way of creating or simulating

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:26.750
information symmetry.
 

00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:35.737
But if the third party agencies
act like sellers to the side

00:37:35.737 --> 00:37:42.286
that pays them,
the information asymmetry is

00:37:42.286 --> 00:37:47.010
actually made worse,
right.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:54.478
And the strongest case for
increased government regulation

00:37:54.478 --> 00:38:00.112
of the finance industry
generally, actually,

00:38:00.112 --> 00:38:06.010
is the difficulty of policing
the police;

00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:12.501
of tracking the integrity of
estimates put out there by

00:38:12.501 --> 00:38:19.115
people who are in the business
of correcting information

00:38:19.115 --> 00:38:21.039
asymmetries.
 

00:38:21.039 --> 00:38:32.742
Jaan, are there aspects of the
case that you would urge us to

00:38:32.742 --> 00:38:38.010
pay greater attention to?
 

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:43.260
Jan Elias:
&gt;

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.682
Well, first of all,
on the Triple A story,

00:38:45.682 --> 00:38:48.045
and this may not be in the
case, per say,

00:38:48.045 --> 00:38:50.469
but it's certainly part of the
thing.

00:38:50.469 --> 00:38:54.280
Not only is there a nice little
boost to the true cost of

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:56.800
capital if you get rated Triple
A,

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:59.739
but there are certain funds and
certain buyers,

00:38:59.739 --> 00:39:02.789
like money market funds and
other funds,

00:39:02.789 --> 00:39:04.550
that only can buy Triple
A bonds.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:08.311
So once you've crossed that
threshold, you have just

00:39:08.311 --> 00:39:12.219
absolutely increased the number
of people and possible

00:39:12.219 --> 00:39:14.360
purchasers of your funds.
 

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.646
Because if you put money in a
money market fund,

00:39:16.646 --> 00:39:19.079
you want a reasonably liquid
investment, you want a

00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:20.539
reasonably assured return.
 

00:39:20.539 --> 00:39:24.532
These are not supposed to be
risky investments and therefore

00:39:24.532 --> 00:39:27.509
money market funds,
all kinds of other funds,

00:39:27.509 --> 00:39:29.809
are limited to Triple A bonds.
 

00:39:29.809 --> 00:39:34.268
So, getting to the Triple A
level was really important.

00:39:34.268 --> 00:39:36.121
To say something,
you could go,

00:39:36.121 --> 00:39:39.271
"I'm not a big fan of
their performance in this

00:39:39.271 --> 00:39:41.740
case," but in terms of
Moody's &amp;

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:45.318
Fitch and everything,
the collusion doesn't--there

00:39:45.318 --> 00:39:49.150
doesn't have to be explicit
collusion in the sense that,

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:53.268
if I give you this bond to
rate, I will never rate a bond

00:39:53.268 --> 00:39:56.579
again unless you give me a
Triple A rating.

00:39:56.579 --> 00:40:00.597
What happened in this case is
Moody's and Fitch and others put

00:40:00.597 --> 00:40:04.353
out fairly explicit guidelines
on what they consider to be

00:40:04.353 --> 00:40:05.210
Triple A.
 

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:09.536
So, you're the bond packager at
the iBank, you're bringing

00:40:09.536 --> 00:40:11.889
together all these mortgages.
 

00:40:11.889 --> 00:40:15.679
And you say "I have to
reach a fifteen percent

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:18.630
threshold level,
where it's fifteen percent over

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:21.822
collateralized,
or I have to buy CDS,

00:40:21.822 --> 00:40:26.601
which are the default swaps,
in order to ensure this

00:40:26.601 --> 00:40:29.708
investment and get it over that
Triple A bump,"

00:40:29.708 --> 00:40:33.730
you do exactly what you need to
do to get that Triple A rating.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:37.375
And what happened when the
crisis hit is we had all of

00:40:37.375 --> 00:40:41.501
these people who are just
over the Triple A rating and

00:40:41.501 --> 00:40:44.065
they--
I mean, with them just

00:40:44.065 --> 00:40:47.545
over you don't have a spread--
you don't have a usual

00:40:47.545 --> 00:40:49.289
probability distribution.
 

00:40:49.289 --> 00:40:53.275
All of these guys who were
creating these CDOs knew exactly

00:40:53.275 --> 00:40:56.864
where the finish line was,
and went just a step over that

00:40:56.864 --> 00:40:59.789
to make sure that they would get
the Triple A ratings.

00:40:59.789 --> 00:41:04.670
So, the fact that they were not
very well understood,

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:08.237
that the historic data went
back three years and they felt

00:41:08.237 --> 00:41:11.869
very confident in doing stuff
with three years of data,

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.960
I think that's an interesting
way.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:18.898
Because, when you're looking
for active collusion you expect

00:41:18.898 --> 00:41:24.528
guys in seedy bars,
trading information and dollars

00:41:24.528 --> 00:41:30.260
in brown paper envelopes,
and sometimes it's not that

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.159
explicit.
 

00:41:31.159 --> 00:41:35.652
There are ways that gaming the
system without having anyone do

00:41:35.652 --> 00:41:39.630
anything that even resembles
something that sketchy.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:44.797
Prof: So,
it may be that legitimate

00:41:44.797 --> 00:41:51.853
cheating, cheating in a good
blue suit, is more dangerous

00:41:51.853 --> 00:41:58.659
than cheating in a seedier
setting with seedier...

00:41:58.659 --> 00:42:01.311
Jaan Elias:
Or you're using a formula

00:42:01.311 --> 00:42:04.333
that's really untested by a heck
of a lot of data,

00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:06.000
may be also a bad idea.
 

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.760
And to go on,
I'm actually kind of surprised,

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:15.202
Doug, given that we're at an
elite university with lots of

00:42:15.202 --> 00:42:19.130
people with connections to Wall
Street in some way or another,

00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:23.610
that everyone thought the zebra
was the people buying the

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:24.329
houses.
 

00:42:24.329 --> 00:42:29.175
If you look at the data,
and you have Mark Kellogg's

00:42:29.175 --> 00:42:32.677
purchase list there,
if you look at the data,

00:42:32.677 --> 00:42:35.806
you begin to notice not only is
there a pattern in who the

00:42:35.806 --> 00:42:38.286
appraiser is,
but there are patterns as to

00:42:38.286 --> 00:42:39.280
who the buyer is.
 

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.498
We have this one buyer here,
and I'm just looking at it in a

00:42:43.498 --> 00:42:46.206
four-year period,
bought five houses,

00:42:46.206 --> 00:42:48.829
six houses, all with the same
broker,

00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:51.079
all with the same appraiser.
 

00:42:51.079 --> 00:42:55.840
We go down and there are others
here, seven or eight times.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.449
Just look at the names and they
repeat themselves.

00:42:58.449 --> 00:43:03.753
So, I would put the question
back here, who's the lion and

00:43:03.753 --> 00:43:06.639
who's the zebra in this case?
 

00:43:06.639 --> 00:43:08.539
Was it the iBanks?
 

00:43:08.539 --> 00:43:12.804
They were relying on these
folks in Cleveland to do a

00:43:12.804 --> 00:43:19.083
reasonable job in appraising,
in putting out the thing,

00:43:19.083 --> 00:43:22.923
and in the end,
that's what went into those

00:43:22.923 --> 00:43:24.679
formulas that I was talking
about.

00:43:24.679 --> 00:43:27.326
The fact that,
okay, you have houses that are

00:43:27.326 --> 00:43:30.634
appraised at this much and
historically they default at,

00:43:30.634 --> 00:43:32.679
let's say, a ten percent rate.
 

00:43:32.679 --> 00:43:36.579
But they didn't take into
account the fact that you have

00:43:36.579 --> 00:43:40.409
people who are just jiggering
the system and going,

00:43:40.409 --> 00:43:43.914
in a six month period,
buying a house at $25,000 and

00:43:43.914 --> 00:43:47.969
selling it at $85,000 with no
evidence of any remodeling.

00:43:47.969 --> 00:43:51.880
And it just goes on,
you &gt;

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:52.829
go through with it.
 

00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:55.724
The sell sheet is actually
fascinating if you want to play

00:43:55.724 --> 00:43:58.338
junior detective;
if you want to see how these

00:43:58.338 --> 00:44:01.400
patterns--and the data,
and you can look at the data,

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:04.110
and go "You know,
this can't be right.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:07.817
This really can't be right in
terms of selling and how much

00:44:07.817 --> 00:44:10.309
they're selling the things
for."

00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:12.306
And it's actually,
when you look at the story of

00:44:12.306 --> 00:44:14.190
Cleveland,
which wasn't a hot market,

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:17.163
and you can't come up with a
story like you might for Miami

00:44:17.163 --> 00:44:19.110
or Las Vegas and think
"Well,

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.956
a lot of old people are going
to move here and that's the

00:44:21.956 --> 00:44:23.889
reason land value's coming
up."

00:44:23.889 --> 00:44:28.177
You can't come up with a story
like that for Cleveland and it's

00:44:28.177 --> 00:44:30.668
a wonderful town,
don't get me wrong,

00:44:30.668 --> 00:44:32.190
but there isn't...
 

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:34.487
Prof: Worst yes,
they've got the Indians and the

00:44:34.487 --> 00:44:34.869
Browns.
 

00:44:34.869 --> 00:44:37.972
Jaan Elias:
Yes and they have the Rock

00:44:37.972 --> 00:44:40.793
'n' Roll Hall of Fame but
there's really,

00:44:40.793 --> 00:44:44.179
you know, it's hard to come up
with a story.

00:44:44.179 --> 00:44:49.690
So, why are we getting this
kind of occurrence and so on?

00:44:49.690 --> 00:44:52.389
So, that's the point I would
make.

00:44:52.389 --> 00:44:54.840
Prof: Okay.
 

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.922
Student:
So, one thing that I saw was I

00:44:56.922 --> 00:44:59.608
felt like the zebra really
represents potential profits and

00:44:59.608 --> 00:45:02.110
economic profit more than an
individual in itself.

00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:05.510
So, if you look from each of
the actors' point of views,

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:08.248
the zebra is really what
they're--the profits that

00:45:08.248 --> 00:45:11.210
they're going after under the
system that's set up.

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:14.135
So, rationally,
each player is acting in their

00:45:14.135 --> 00:45:17.385
own best interests but,
in the end, the big picture

00:45:17.385 --> 00:45:20.570
ends up where it hurts the
system as a whole.

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:25.215
And so, I think that it's very
easy to want to put blame on a

00:45:25.215 --> 00:45:28.159
specific party or a specific
group,

00:45:28.159 --> 00:45:30.871
but it's just very difficult to
do because everybody's working

00:45:30.871 --> 00:45:33.539
under the incentives that has
been created for that party.

00:45:33.539 --> 00:45:36.335
Jaan Elias:
And may I offer another

00:45:36.335 --> 00:45:40.860
potential zebra to consider,
which is the folks--let's say

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:45.679
you're buying one of these
houses and the house next to you

00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:50.916
has been bought for $25,000 and
sold for $85,000 with no visible

00:45:50.916 --> 00:45:52.329
improvement.
 

00:45:52.329 --> 00:45:55.199
You bought your home for
$30,000, you've put another

00:45:55.199 --> 00:45:59.672
$40,000 into it,
you have a legitimately $70,000

00:45:59.672 --> 00:46:02.050
house,
how are you going to feel when

00:46:02.050 --> 00:46:04.599
that house next to you gets
boarded up and goes into

00:46:04.599 --> 00:46:07.949
foreclosure because someone has
been playing the appraisal game?

00:46:07.949 --> 00:46:12.018
So, there's an externality here
to consider too in the overall

00:46:12.018 --> 00:46:12.820
community.
 

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:16.295
Prof: So,
who's got an idea about how to

00:46:16.295 --> 00:46:17.429
fix all this?
 

00:46:17.429 --> 00:46:23.396
Would it be drumming
truth-telling into three year

00:46:23.396 --> 00:46:24.250
olds?
 

00:46:24.250 --> 00:46:35.570
Would it be--yes?
 

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:36.746
Student:
I think there's a huge gap in

00:46:36.746 --> 00:46:38.960
government oversight,
particularly with regard to the

00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:41.208
ratings that,
I mean, when Moody's

00:46:41.208 --> 00:46:46.199
is--although they have the cross
pressures that you talked about,

00:46:46.199 --> 00:46:49.521
but when Moody's is being paid
by one side and not the other

00:46:49.521 --> 00:46:52.391
and even if we assumed that
they're all inflated and

00:46:52.391 --> 00:46:55.150
therefore just interpret them to
be suspect,

00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:59.960
without some third party that's
completely disinterested,

00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.949
like the government coming in
and telling you how to rate it,

00:47:02.949 --> 00:47:05.239
you're not going to get
truthful ratings and therefore

00:47:05.239 --> 00:47:07.139
the whole system falls apart
from the top.

00:47:07.139 --> 00:47:10.239
Prof: Yes,
that sounds right.

00:47:10.239 --> 00:47:17.072
And one of my own inclinations
would be to compel the initial

00:47:17.072 --> 00:47:23.108
lenders to hold a given
percentage equity in each loan

00:47:23.108 --> 00:47:28.914
so that they can't utterly
ignore the probability of

00:47:28.914 --> 00:47:30.510
default.
 

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:44.268
On Monday I'm going to,
Monday is a wildcard in the

00:47:44.268 --> 00:47:50.529
syllabus,
and I had planned to use it to

00:47:50.529 --> 00:47:55.570
do the Morys business plan,
but it turns out that there are

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.510
people who think it would be a
terrible idea if the Morys

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:03.099
business plan got to the Yale
Daily News.

00:48:03.099 --> 00:48:10.340
And while we're 110 really good
friends, I think I'd be nuts to

00:48:10.340 --> 00:48:13.260
use that at this stage.
 

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:16.221
We'll do that at the end of the
semester when it won't be--when

00:48:16.221 --> 00:48:18.800
it will not cause bloodshed
somewhere in the system.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:25.630
And we'll do a--I'd like to do
two things with Monday.

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:30.380
One is: I'll post a case on
Vioxx, the drug which was a

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:35.746
COX-II inhibitor and did a lot
of good for people like me with

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:39.059
knee trouble,
but it killed a few of them.

00:48:39.059 --> 00:48:43.856
And there were hard feelings
and a vast avalanche of

00:48:43.856 --> 00:48:47.150
lawsuits, and we'll look at
that.

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:50.239
I'm also going to post
Federalist Paper number ten.

00:48:50.239 --> 00:48:53.369
Could I--hands up if you've
read Federalist ten.

00:48:53.369 --> 00:48:56.001
No American,
nobody who's going to do

00:48:56.001 --> 00:49:00.070
business in this country,
should fail to get the idea of

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:03.980
the fundamental design of the
American political system,

00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.610
which is spelled out in only a
few thousand words there.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.699
See you on Monday.
 

00:49:09.699 --> 00:49:15.000

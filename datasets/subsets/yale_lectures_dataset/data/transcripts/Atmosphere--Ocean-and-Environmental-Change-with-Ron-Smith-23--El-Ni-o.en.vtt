RONALD SMITH: Well we're
going to talk about El

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.967
Nino today.

00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:09.733
I've got a PowerPoint
presentation, but before I get

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:11.633
into that, I wanted to give
a bunch of definitions.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:21.300
So El Nino is a naturally
occurring oscillation in the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.333
Pacific Ocean between two
rather distinct states.

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:37.867
El Nino was defined about 30
or 40 years ago as a state

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:39.433
that the ocean went
into occasionally.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.333
Originally it was defined as a
condition of having warmer

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:50.900
than usual waters in the Eastern
Tropical Pacific, and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.433
low biological productivity.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.500
Those two things were the
original definition.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.200
As we began to study it, we
realized that there are many

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.333
other things going on involving
trade wind strength,

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.500
Walker circulation,
precipitation patterns.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.000
So now it is-- definition has
broadened to include a number

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.133
of related symptoms, and I'll
be discussing those in the

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:20.367
PowerPoint presentation.

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:21.900
Let me go through these
two diagrams to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.133
kind of get it started.

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:29.067
Now, one thing that's most
curious about this is that

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:34.533
these two states can exist
without any external forcing.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:36.800
It's like one day you wake up
in the morning and you feel

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.633
great, another morning you wake
up in the morning you

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:42.300
feel crummy, and there's nothing
external necessarily

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.133
that's driving this.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:46.400
It's just kind of
the way it is.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.533
Well El Nino's not exactly
like that.

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:50.433
There's a lot of physics
involved in it.

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:53.733
But it doesn't seem to be driven
by anything external.

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:58.067
It's not the Sun, it's not the
tilt of the Earth, it's not

00:01:58.067 --> 00:02:02.267
some kind of change occurring
by human-induced changes.

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:07.100
It just seems to have periods of
several months when it does

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.567
one thing and periods of several
months when it does

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:11.300
something else.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.833
And this will kind of get you
started on the discussion.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:17.900
So I've got two identical
cross-sections here.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.367
They run West to East through
the Equatorial Pacific Ocean.

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:29.467
So there's Asia on this side,
the Andes in South

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:31.233
America on this side.

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:34.133
The International Date Line
would be somewhere in the

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:38.633
middle that'd be 180 degrees
West or East longitude.

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:45.267
And most of the time you've
got a situation that looks

00:02:45.267 --> 00:02:46.267
something like this.

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:53.700
You've got very warm water in
the Western Pacific, warm air

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.467
as well, and because of that
you've got a lot of convective

00:02:57.467 --> 00:02:59.400
precipitation.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.100
Sometimes this part of the ocean
is called the warm pool.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.800
If you say a warm pool to an
oceanographer or to an

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.233
atmospheric scientist, they know
that you're referring, or

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.167
they suspect you're referring to
the Western Pacific because

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:17.167
there we get the warmest ocean
temperatures anywhere on the

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:20.667
globe, at least during
this phase of the El

00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:21.933
Nino, La Nina cycle.

00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:26.433
So this is a warm pool in the
Western Equatorial and

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.267
Tropical Pacific.

00:03:28.267 --> 00:03:32.567
Lower atmospheric pressure
because the air is warmer, and

00:03:32.567 --> 00:03:35.200
because the air is warm it's
less dense, so the pressure

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.167
underneath, warmer air is
usually lower pressure.

00:03:40.167 --> 00:03:43.500
During those periods of time you
have strong Easterly trade

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.633
winds, so I've drawn
them this way.

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:53.500
The trade winds return a loft
in what's called the Walker

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.067
circulation.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:59.533
So remember, the Hadley cell you
would see if I sliced it

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:02.333
this way, across the Equator,
here I'm slicing

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:03.733
it along the Equator.

00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:06.400
So we don't see the Hadley
circulation, but we do see

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.767
this Walker circulation.

00:04:09.767 --> 00:04:13.400
It returns the low level
Easterlies in upper level

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.533
Westerlies.

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:19.400
In the Eastern Tropical Pacific
you have generally

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.233
higher air pressure.

00:04:23.233 --> 00:04:28.667
Cooler ocean waters, and the
cooler waters makes it, at the

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:34.233
surface, makes it easier for
nutrient rich water from below

00:04:34.233 --> 00:04:37.933
to mix up to the surface, in
part due to coastal upwelling

00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:41.133
that we spoke about last time.

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:43.233
And as a result of that, you
have generally a high

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:50.167
biological productivity during
this phase of the cycle.

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:55.233
So let's say then we go into
an El Nino situation.

00:04:55.233 --> 00:04:59.100
Now the word El Nino comes from
the fact that when this

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:06.533
switchover occurs, it usually
occurs in November, December

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:11.600
or January, not too far from
the Christmas season.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.167
The countries along the West
Coast of South America are

00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:19.333
generally Catholic in their
religion, and the Christ child

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:20.533
is worshipped.

00:05:20.533 --> 00:05:23.767
And the fact that this
switchover, when it occurs,

00:05:23.767 --> 00:05:27.467
usually occurred within a few
weeks of Christmastime meant

00:05:27.467 --> 00:05:29.400
that it was given the
name El Nino, the

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.100
child, the Christ child.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.633
That's where the term
comes from.

00:05:33.633 --> 00:05:35.600
So it has kind of everything
reversed.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.267
You've got weaker trade winds,
cooler than usual ocean

00:05:40.267 --> 00:05:44.033
temperatures and air
temperatures, higher air

00:05:44.033 --> 00:05:48.433
pressures, the Walker
circulation is weakened, I

00:05:48.433 --> 00:05:52.000
haven't drawn it here lower
pressure than usual in the

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.900
East side of the Pacific.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.767
Along with precipitation
occurring along the coast of

00:05:59.767 --> 00:06:02.267
South American near
the Equator.

00:06:02.267 --> 00:06:05.533
With the warm water here
you have strongly

00:06:05.533 --> 00:06:09.100
stabilized the ocean.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.633
Warm water floating
above cold water.

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:14.500
The nutrients are still down
there below, but they can't

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.533
mix to the surface, so you get
a low biological productivity

00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:25.500
in that part of the cycle.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.300
Any questions on that?

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.733
Yes.

00:06:26.733 --> 00:06:29.067
STUDENT: Why does the Walker
Circulation weaken?

00:06:29.067 --> 00:06:31.333
PROFESSOR: Well because it's part of this--

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:36.133
the air that goes Westward in
the trade wind has to move

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:37.067
back Eastward.

00:06:37.067 --> 00:06:41.067
So that whole circulation is
called the Walker circ--

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:45.600
it's just closing the
cycle on the strong

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.267
Easterly trade winds.

00:06:47.267 --> 00:06:51.033
But remember, when air in the
Walker circulation reaches

00:06:51.033 --> 00:06:56.300
this point and then tries to
descend to match up with this,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.633
that descending air is going to
prevent clouds from forming

00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:02.900
here, and that's consistent
with what I've drawn.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.833
And here, when this air has to
ascend to then form the rest

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:09.667
of the Walker circulation, the
ascent occurs in these

00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:10.767
convective clouds.

00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:12.567
So that's consistent as well.

00:07:12.567 --> 00:07:14.933
Then when I've weakened the
Walker circulation, that's

00:07:14.933 --> 00:07:16.400
consistent with the
way I've drawn the

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.233
clouds there as well.

00:07:18.233 --> 00:07:20.633
So there are physical laws
connecting all of

00:07:20.633 --> 00:07:22.100
these things together.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:25.233
But on this diagram, and in
fact, in most of what I'll be

00:07:25.233 --> 00:07:28.067
saying today, there's going to
be very little explanation

00:07:28.067 --> 00:07:32.200
about why the system would
switch back and forth.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.100
So I'm mostly going to be
talking about what we observe

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.633
the atmosphere ocean to do in
this part of the world, how

00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:45.000
the various symptoms tie
together physically.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.967
But the scientific community
does not have a clear

00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.067
understanding of what would
make this system suddenly

00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:54.467
switch from one phase
to the other.

00:07:54.467 --> 00:07:57.400
So I'm not going to spend a lot
of time dealing with that.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:01.133
It's kind of one of the
remaining unknowns.

00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:02.867
It's not that there hasn't
been work on it, it's not

00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:06.400
there hasn't been theories
proposed, but I would say it's

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.733
not a solved problem in terms
of what causes the system to

00:08:09.733 --> 00:08:11.500
cycle back and forth
like this.

00:08:14.067 --> 00:08:21.400
So I'll get in now to the way
some of these things look.

00:08:30.067 --> 00:08:31.333
And stop me if you
have questions.

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:42.633
So it's a natural oscillation
in the air-sea state of the

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:46.167
Tropical Pacific Ocean.

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:49.167
I'm going to start out with
a lot of attention

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:51.167
paid to this region.

00:08:51.167 --> 00:08:55.067
We described it last time as a
region of coastal upwelling.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:58.767
And that, indeed, is where the
studies of El Nino began.

00:08:58.767 --> 00:09:01.133
That's where it was first
identified, and that's where a

00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:03.700
number of the early definitions
come from is the

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:07.700
variability along the Peruvian
Coast there.

00:09:11.967 --> 00:09:14.567
And to remind you, a typical
well, this is not necessarily

00:09:14.567 --> 00:09:19.433
typical, this is a temperature
anomaly from a year ago, just

00:09:19.433 --> 00:09:23.233
about a year ago today these
are what the sea surface

00:09:23.233 --> 00:09:27.267
temperature anomalies
look like.

00:09:27.267 --> 00:09:30.867
The blue means cooler, so you've
got a cooler water than

00:09:30.867 --> 00:09:34.933
usual in the Eastern Tropical
Pacific a year ago.

00:09:34.933 --> 00:09:37.600
And which side of the cycle?

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.700
Is that El Nino or La Nina?

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.600
STUDENT: La Nina.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.567
PROFESSOR: La Nina, right.

00:09:42.567 --> 00:09:49.300
So a year ago, there was a La
Nina existing, because you can

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:52.400
identify that immediately
because of the colder than

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.933
usual conditions in the sea
surface temperature in the

00:09:55.933 --> 00:09:58.400
Eastern Tropical Pacific.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.200
So a year ago there was La Nina,
and near the end of the

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.700
presentation I'll bring that
up to date, we'll see what

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:08.333
state the Tropical Pacific
has today.

00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:11.667
So here's what you need to
know for terminology.

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.333
I wasn't able to get the umlauts
over the n's there.

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:18.867
But El Nino and La Nina, which
are the phases of this

00:10:18.867 --> 00:10:23.267
oscillation, the Southern
Oscillation Index is defined

00:10:23.267 --> 00:10:27.967
as the pressure difference
between Darwin in Australia,

00:10:27.967 --> 00:10:35.333
and Tahiti in the Eastern
Central Pacific Ocean, and

00:10:35.333 --> 00:10:39.200
that is a measure of this
pressure oscillation that I

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:39.933
told you about.

00:10:39.933 --> 00:10:43.200
So on occasion you'll see
plots of the Southern

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.267
Oscillation Index, and
that's the pressure

00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:50.367
symptom of this cycle.

00:10:50.367 --> 00:10:52.100
The Walker circulation
I've defined.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:56.100
It's a circulation that occurs
more or less in the plane of

00:10:56.100 --> 00:11:00.900
the Equator, taking some of
the trade wind flow and

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.600
returning it back to the
East aloft in the upper

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.667
troposphere.

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:10.967
In a few minutes I'll show you
the TOA array, which we now

00:11:10.967 --> 00:11:14.233
use to monitor El Nino.

00:11:14.233 --> 00:11:17.233
It's quite a remarkable set
of instrumentation.

00:11:17.233 --> 00:11:20.133
Sea surface temperature we
talked about before, and we've

00:11:20.133 --> 00:11:24.233
already defined thermocline
and primary productivity.

00:11:24.233 --> 00:11:27.133
I'll be using those terms freely
as we go through the

00:11:27.133 --> 00:11:28.567
discussion today.

00:11:28.567 --> 00:11:33.200
So be sure you're clear on all
of those terminologies.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.333
So here's a list of some
of the symptoms then.

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:38.367
So during El Nino you've
got reduced biological

00:11:38.367 --> 00:11:41.667
productivity in the
Eastern Pacific.

00:11:41.667 --> 00:11:44.167
Warm water in the
Eastern Pacific.

00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:45.800
Weak or reversed trade winds.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.533
Lower pressure in the
Eastern Pacific.

00:11:48.533 --> 00:11:52.767
Rain in the East, and as I'll
show you later on, there are

00:11:52.767 --> 00:11:56.867
some distant climate anomalies
that are connected with El

00:11:56.867 --> 00:12:00.733
Nino, but occur in other parts
of the world as well.

00:12:00.733 --> 00:12:05.333
I'll get to that later
in the lecture.

00:12:05.333 --> 00:12:08.167
So here's kind of
where it began.

00:12:08.167 --> 00:12:10.367
As you saw from the chlorophyll
map, it's a very

00:12:10.367 --> 00:12:15.133
highly productive region along
the Peruvian Coast because of

00:12:15.133 --> 00:12:19.700
the cold water being brought up
in the Humboldt current or

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:25.267
the Peru current, generally
destabilizing that ocean.

00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:30.033
And then the winds, the trade
winds, with the Ekman layer

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:34.267
pumping water offshore causing
coastal upwelling bringing

00:12:34.267 --> 00:12:36.900
nutrient rich waters
to the surface.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.300
Well given that then, and
here's an example of a

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.433
Peruvian fishing boat
catching anchovies.

00:12:44.433 --> 00:12:46.867
Given that understanding, what
would cause such a phenomenon

00:12:46.867 --> 00:12:51.033
where the anchovy catch
increased from the '50s up to

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:54.400
the '60s, and then in the early
'70s, especially in

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.300
1973, it crashed.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.967
Well this is a buildup
of the fishing fleet.

00:12:58.967 --> 00:13:06.833
More and more--more and more
fish, and people, and ships

00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:08.400
involved in fishing.

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.133
What would cause
a sudden drop?

00:13:10.133 --> 00:13:11.133
Two possibilities.

00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:13.733
It could be overfishing.

00:13:13.733 --> 00:13:18.133
But it turns out later on
this rebounds again.

00:13:18.133 --> 00:13:19.800
So it turns out it's
not overfishing.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:23.100
It was some change in the
natural condition of the

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.733
Eastern Tropical Pacific, and
that was the onset of one of

00:13:26.733 --> 00:13:29.167
the strongest El Nino
situations.

00:13:29.167 --> 00:13:33.033
So it was first defined as
this drop in biological

00:13:33.033 --> 00:13:36.767
productivity, which we know
has something to do with

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:40.833
coastal upwelling, the stability
of the ocean

00:13:40.833 --> 00:13:45.467
thermocline, and we'll follow
that train of cause and

00:13:45.467 --> 00:13:48.300
effect as we go.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.367
Here's the way it's
defined today.

00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:54.067
Largely in terms of the surface
temperature of the

00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:57.900
Pacific Ocean, and the depth
of the thermocline.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:04.533
So during La Nina, you have
generally a steeply inclined

00:14:04.533 --> 00:14:10.500
thermocline, deeper in the
Western Pacific with lots of

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.133
warm water then.

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:15.600
But shallower in the Eastern
Pacific, which means the cold

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.700
water is brought up
very close to the

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:21.600
surface, even to the surface.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.133
The normal condition is halfway
in between, and then

00:14:24.133 --> 00:14:28.367
the El Nino situation is when
the thermocline is flatter

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:29.733
across the Pacific Ocean.

00:14:32.267 --> 00:14:35.667
Remember the Date Line is in
here, so this is 120 East and

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:38.533
this is 80 degrees West.
The Date Line is

00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:40.667
somewhere in there.

00:14:40.667 --> 00:14:43.900
But this means you've got a big
deep layer of warm water

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.167
near the Eastern--

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:51.600
in the Eastern part of the
Tropical Pacific preventing

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.600
efficient mixing of nutrient
rich waters to the surface.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.133
So that's the way we envision
this today after 30 or 40

00:15:00.133 --> 00:15:02.500
years of study.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.500
And the Walker circulation looks
something like this.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:11.333
Now, in the normal circulation
you get strong trade winds,

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:15.633
rising motion over the warm
pool, and then a return of air

00:15:15.633 --> 00:15:18.333
aloft towards the East
and then sinking.

00:15:18.333 --> 00:15:21.800
During the Walker circulation
that is weaker and breaks up

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.333
and you get rising motion in
the East. And this may

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:26.067
exaggerate it.

00:15:26.067 --> 00:15:29.833
This shows an actual reverse
trade winds.

00:15:29.833 --> 00:15:31.133
That isn't always the case.

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:35.533
But at least they are weaker
than they would be during the

00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:36.933
typical situation.

00:15:36.933 --> 00:15:41.833
So weakened trade winds, and low
pressure and rising motion

00:15:41.833 --> 00:15:46.267
in the Eastern Tropical
Pacific.

00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:48.700
The ocean surface temperatures
differ dramatically.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:53.767
Here's an example of a map
derived by satellite using

00:15:53.767 --> 00:15:56.567
infrared radiation emitted
from the sea surface to

00:15:56.567 --> 00:15:57.900
determine its temperature.

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.367
During El Nino, and indeed,
these are anomalies I believe,

00:16:02.367 --> 00:16:05.000
rather than absolute
temperatures.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.400
Yeah, but they show this warm
anomaly as much as three or

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.333
four degrees warmer than
normal for sea surface

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:15.333
temperature in this coastal
region, and then extending out

00:16:15.333 --> 00:16:20.733
along the Equator in the Eastern
Tropical Pacific.

00:16:20.733 --> 00:16:23.533
So the temperature differences
are really substantial.

00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:23.900
Yes?

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.700
STUDENT: What's the difference
between an anomaly and a

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.200
normal temperature map?

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:27.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.167
So what they do is subtract--

00:16:29.167 --> 00:16:36.033
for every pixel, they subtract
off a long-term average sea

00:16:36.033 --> 00:16:37.433
surface temperature.

00:16:37.433 --> 00:16:40.500
So what you end up with is of
course, when you plot, then,

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.967
normal conditions, it's a very
small variation because you

00:16:44.967 --> 00:16:48.100
subtracted off most of the
normal considerations, most of

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:49.333
the normal pattern.

00:16:49.333 --> 00:16:52.400
So what's left allows you to
amplify these changes.

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.167
So you just subtract the normal
I think some of the

00:16:55.167 --> 00:16:59.000
plots you're working with in
lab this week, some of that

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.733
data was given to you in terms
of anomaly, rather than the

00:17:01.733 --> 00:17:02.733
actual temperature.

00:17:02.733 --> 00:17:07.033
So it's a common trick played by
climatologists to bring out

00:17:07.033 --> 00:17:09.200
the differences between
the current state

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.433
and the normal state.

00:17:12.433 --> 00:17:16.400
It doesn't mean, for example,
that these are the warmest

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.667
temperatures in the ocean.

00:17:17.667 --> 00:17:21.067
It might still be slightly
warmer over here, but because

00:17:21.067 --> 00:17:24.100
that's normally warm that
doesn't show up in this

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.367
anomaly map.

00:17:29.633 --> 00:17:32.533
I mentioned global impacts.

00:17:32.533 --> 00:17:35.467
This is not completely
understood either, but people

00:17:35.467 --> 00:17:39.800
have once they understood this
cycle of changing conditions

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.867
in the Tropical Pacific, they
tried to then correlate it to

00:17:43.867 --> 00:17:46.433
climate in other parts
of the world.

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:50.300
There's been a few rather
well-known papers been

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.333
published on this the
last 5 or 10 years.

00:17:54.333 --> 00:17:57.667
For example, here's what we
think the El Nino weather

00:17:57.667 --> 00:18:01.200
patterns are for the
winter season.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.833
If you have an El Nino in the
particular year in the winter

00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:09.033
season, Northern Hemisphere
winter, December, you should

00:18:09.033 --> 00:18:18.200
expect to get generally, drier
conditions in through here,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.333
warmer conditions there.

00:18:19.333 --> 00:18:20.733
Well that's part of
the definition, I

00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:21.833
have that in my diagram.

00:18:21.833 --> 00:18:24.233
But elsewhere you can get
anomalies as well.

00:18:24.233 --> 00:18:28.033
For example, even here in New
England, you might have a

00:18:28.033 --> 00:18:31.733
warmer than typical winter
because of some kind of remote

00:18:31.733 --> 00:18:35.267
effect of this El Nino cycle.

00:18:35.267 --> 00:18:40.500
In the Pacific Northwest you'd
have warmer conditions, in the

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:44.667
Southern part of the US you'd
have drier conditions.

00:18:44.667 --> 00:18:47.233
In the summertime the
relationships work a little

00:18:47.233 --> 00:18:49.267
bit different, but they're
shown here.

00:18:54.867 --> 00:18:59.867
One of the ways we monitor El
Nino is to keep track of the

00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:05.567
ocean surface temperatures in
these four kind of commonly

00:19:05.567 --> 00:19:06.700
defined areas.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:12.767
All the scientists who work on
El Nino agree to monitor these

00:19:12.767 --> 00:19:13.967
four temperatures.

00:19:13.967 --> 00:19:15.867
Sea surface temperature
in area one,

00:19:15.867 --> 00:19:17.467
two, three, and four.

00:19:17.467 --> 00:19:21.167
So you'll find plot, for
example, of Nino four or Nino

00:19:21.167 --> 00:19:24.833
three, a temperature plotted
as a function of time.

00:19:24.833 --> 00:19:26.333
It's right on the Equator.

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:30.133
Usually it goes 5 degrees North
to 5 degrees South, and

00:19:30.133 --> 00:19:32.733
that's kind of a commonly
agreed upon way

00:19:32.733 --> 00:19:35.400
to monitor El Nino.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.500
And here's how it's done.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:43.000
So there's a rather remarkable
array of buoys that was put in

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.833
a decade or so ago across the
Equator in the Pacific.

00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:51.600
Many of these have thermistor
chains that go down into the

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.300
ocean a couple hundred meters,
so you can monitor not only

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:57.633
conditions at the surface,
but subsurface

00:19:57.633 --> 00:19:59.400
temperatures as well.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.033
That's where that diagram
about the depth of the

00:20:02.033 --> 00:20:08.067
thermocline came from, looking
at the thermistor chain data

00:20:08.067 --> 00:20:10.900
dangling beneath these buoys.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.600
But you can log in, you can just
go to their website at

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.567
anytime day or night and get
current data for what the

00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:19.833
ocean is doing in this
part of the world.

00:20:19.833 --> 00:20:22.133
So it makes it a very if you've
got a new theory, if

00:20:22.133 --> 00:20:25.100
you've got a better theory than
anyone else, you can test

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.067
it immediately because this data
is available, not only

00:20:28.067 --> 00:20:31.867
historically going back 10
years or so, but it's

00:20:31.867 --> 00:20:35.200
available day by day, so you
can test new theories and

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.467
maybe make predictions.

00:20:37.467 --> 00:20:41.200
So it's become a very kind of
open-ended egalitarian subject

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.100
where anybody with a better
idea can put it forward

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.600
because the data is there
for anybody to work on.

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:55.767
So here's a couple
of plots then.

00:20:55.767 --> 00:21:00.333
One is the ocean temperature
departures for the combination

00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:04.000
of Nino three and four.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.467
And then below that is the SOI,
the Southern Oscillation

00:21:07.467 --> 00:21:10.667
Index, which is defined as the
pressure difference, it's

00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:13.633
Tahiti minus Darwin.

00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:17.067
Right, Tahiti is the
Eastward-most station of the

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:21.767
two, and Darwin is, of course,
is in Northern Australia.

00:21:21.767 --> 00:21:24.367
So be sure you get the
sign of this right.

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:31.800
So, you know, you wouldn't
expect to find such a tight

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.267
relationship between these two
rather different quantities.

00:21:36.267 --> 00:21:38.200
One is a sea surface
temperature, one is an

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.200
atmospheric pressure.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.267
However there is a relationship
between the two,

00:21:42.267 --> 00:21:44.200
and I think let's see
which way it works.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:51.900
So when the Eastern Tropical
Pacific is warmer, that means

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:56.267
Tahiti has a let's see, which
way does that work.

00:21:56.267 --> 00:22:02.733
By the way, this is plotted not
in pressure units, but in

00:22:02.733 --> 00:22:06.333
units of standard deviations.

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:08.700
So there's a normal fluctuation
to this pressure

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.200
difference.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.000
You compute the standard
deviation and then you mark

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.633
whether you are close to
normal relative to one

00:22:16.633 --> 00:22:20.500
standard deviation, or one
or two or three standard

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:22.767
deviations away from normal.

00:22:22.767 --> 00:22:24.767
So that's the way that is.

00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:26.833
That standard deviation, again,
I think is the quantity

00:22:26.833 --> 00:22:30.833
you're dealing with
in lab this week.

00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:38.967
So generally, when you have
warmer conditions you have

00:22:38.967 --> 00:22:44.467
lower pressure in Tahiti
relative to Darwin.

00:22:44.467 --> 00:22:48.433
That would make sense because
if there's warmer conditions

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:57.167
in the East, which would be this
condition, with warmer

00:22:57.167 --> 00:23:01.000
air aloft hydrostatically,
that would mean lower

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
atmospheric pressure
beneath it.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.300
So there is a physical law
connecting these two, but

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:08.533
still, it's a bit interesting
that it comes out to be such a

00:23:08.533 --> 00:23:09.700
nice relationship.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:13.467
So where are the El
Nino periods then?

00:23:13.467 --> 00:23:18.467
Well one of the most dramatic
ones was in 1973, and that was

00:23:18.467 --> 00:23:20.733
the drop I showed
you in the ocean

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:23.033
productivity in that region.

00:23:23.033 --> 00:23:26.733
There have been some other since
then, especially 1983,

00:23:26.733 --> 00:23:32.867
'84, '87, '88, '92, and then
one in '90 I guess

00:23:32.867 --> 00:23:34.467
that would be '98.

00:23:34.467 --> 00:23:37.733
And you can spot them either
from the ocean temperature

00:23:37.733 --> 00:23:40.767
departures or from that
pressure difference,

00:23:40.767 --> 00:23:44.667
East-West, across the
Pacific Ocean.

00:23:47.767 --> 00:23:50.467
Questions on this?

00:23:50.467 --> 00:23:52.967
So how often does it occur?

00:23:52.967 --> 00:23:54.633
Well it's not periodic.

00:23:54.633 --> 00:23:58.667
It's not as if you can find
an equal spacing.

00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:01.600
If you had to make a guess,
maybe you would say that it's

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.133
about every, what, five
to seven years,

00:24:05.133 --> 00:24:06.567
something like that.

00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:11.533
But it's not periodic, it's not
predictable, and, you know

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:14.000
the first person that comes up
with a really accurate way to

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.433
predict El Nino will be rich
and famous, because it's an

00:24:18.433 --> 00:24:22.700
unsolved geophysical problem,
but it also has big

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:25.933
implications for the way people
live, for agriculture,

00:24:25.933 --> 00:24:27.633
for fishing, and so on.

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:33.100
So it's a big question as to
what causes these changes and

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:36.567
how to predict them
in the future.

00:24:36.567 --> 00:24:37.833
No questions on that?

00:24:40.967 --> 00:24:42.867
So where are we today?

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.967
This is from a week
or so ago in 2011.

00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:54.167
Here's a sea surface temperature
map, and a sea

00:24:54.167 --> 00:24:55.667
surface temperature anomaly.

00:24:55.667 --> 00:24:57.600
So we'll get to address
that question

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.967
of map versus anomaly.

00:24:58.967 --> 00:25:03.833
So there's the warm pool, and
the temperature is given here

00:25:03.833 --> 00:25:07.100
so there's actually temperatures
higher than 28

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.533
degrees Celsius in
the warm pool.

00:25:10.533 --> 00:25:13.467
Generally, we've got pretty cold
conditions it looks like

00:25:13.467 --> 00:25:14.967
here, but what's the anomaly?

00:25:14.967 --> 00:25:17.933
Well the anomaly is cold too.

00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:23.433
So we are in another
La Nina situation.

00:25:23.433 --> 00:25:26.567
Has it been a La Nina ever since
last year at this time?

00:25:26.567 --> 00:25:31.600
Well here's a plot of Nino one,
two, three, four, and

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.767
then just Nino four, and
look what's happened.

00:25:34.767 --> 00:25:38.067
We were in a La Nina
a year ago.

00:25:38.067 --> 00:25:41.367
We came out of it during
the summer.

00:25:41.367 --> 00:25:45.733
These are anomalies plotted,
SST anomalies for these

00:25:45.733 --> 00:25:47.933
regions we defined in here.

00:25:47.933 --> 00:25:49.533
And now we've slid
back into it.

00:25:49.533 --> 00:25:52.567
So it never was really an
El Nino I would say.

00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:56.533
It never got strong enough or
persisted long enough to have

00:25:56.533 --> 00:25:57.133
an El Nino.

00:25:57.133 --> 00:26:03.200
So it wouldn't--19, sorry, 2010,
2011 would not show up

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.800
as a El Nino period.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:11.700
And now we're solidly back into
a La Nina situation with

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:14.333
cold water in the Eastern
Pacific, high

00:26:14.333 --> 00:26:17.633
productivity, and so on.

00:26:17.633 --> 00:26:21.633
Questions on how to read
these diagrams?

00:26:21.633 --> 00:26:24.133
So I want you to be able to look
at a map like this and

00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:27.967
tell what is the state
of the Pacific Ocean.

00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:28.467
Yeah, Jordan.

00:26:28.467 --> 00:26:29.367
STUDENT: Is the one and two
referring to, like, where the

00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:30.600
temperature is--?

00:26:33.433 --> 00:26:35.667
PROFESSOR: They just
sum the two together.

00:26:35.667 --> 00:26:38.133
They take the let's
go back to that.

00:26:38.133 --> 00:26:42.533
They often don't want to
distinguish between the two,

00:26:42.533 --> 00:26:45.967
so they'll just sum these
two together.

00:26:45.967 --> 00:26:48.867
And sometimes they do that with
three and four, they sum

00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:49.867
the two together.

00:26:49.867 --> 00:26:54.400
It all depends what kind of
detail you want to have in

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.733
your SST description.

00:26:55.733 --> 00:26:59.700
STUDENT: I'm sorry, was that 3.4
that, like dotted red and

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.433
green thing?

00:27:01.433 --> 00:27:02.533
PROFESSOR: Where
am I looking here?

00:27:02.533 --> 00:27:05.333
STUDENT: On the previous slide
that you were just on.

00:27:05.333 --> 00:27:11.067
Is that 3.4, like the red
and green overlap area?

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:11.900
PROFESSOR: Yeah...maybe that's right.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.600
Maybe that's 3.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.333
you're quite right.

00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:15.900
That's not the average
of the two.

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:19.633
That's actually four plus that
little bit of three.

00:27:19.633 --> 00:27:20.433
That's correct.

00:27:20.433 --> 00:27:22.233
Thanks for spotting that.

00:27:22.233 --> 00:27:23.633
I was wrong on that.

00:27:23.633 --> 00:27:24.200
Melanie, is that right?

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:25.433
STUDENT: It's half of four
and half of three.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.433
PROFESSOR: Oh, it's half of the two.

00:27:28.433 --> 00:27:28.733
Sorry.

00:27:28.733 --> 00:27:33.233
So 3.4 is that part of four
and that part of three.

00:27:33.233 --> 00:27:35.833
Melanie's our El Nino expert.

00:27:35.833 --> 00:27:39.567
So she'll tell me afterwards
all the things

00:27:39.567 --> 00:27:40.833
I said wrong today.

00:27:44.267 --> 00:27:47.267
Let's see.

00:27:47.267 --> 00:27:52.933
OK now, here's another
way to look at it.

00:27:52.933 --> 00:27:55.333
I think I've shown you diagram
like this before.

00:27:55.333 --> 00:27:58.633
It's called a Hovmuller
diagram.

00:27:58.633 --> 00:28:02.567
You take data along the
Equator, and this is a

00:28:02.567 --> 00:28:07.800
longitude scale where the Date
Line is right there.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.233
And then you plot sea surface
temperature well this is wind

00:28:11.233 --> 00:28:18.367
in this case trade winds,
as a function of time.

00:28:18.367 --> 00:28:22.767
So you get a time-distance
diagram.

00:28:22.767 --> 00:28:27.200
So at each time you can see what
the strength of the trade

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:32.100
winds were across the
Pacific Ocean.

00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:37.800
So these are the trade wind
strengths between

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:40.333
5 North and 5 South.

00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:44.400
They are negative because a
positive velocity would be

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.367
towards the East, and as you
know, trade winds blow towards

00:28:48.367 --> 00:28:53.067
the West. So generally you've
got trade winds all through

00:28:53.067 --> 00:28:56.333
this part of the Central
Pacific, and these are the U

00:28:56.333 --> 00:29:01.567
anomalies where you subtract
off the normal.

00:29:01.567 --> 00:29:05.900
And indeed, what we're finding
there is that we actually have

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:12.833
a bit of a reverse anomaly in
the Eastern Pacific during the

00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:14.633
last year or so.

00:29:18.767 --> 00:29:21.267
And that is--that's connected
with the La Nina situations

00:29:21.267 --> 00:29:24.200
you look at my diagram
over there.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:28.033
So it's not that the trade winds
reversed, but they're

00:29:28.033 --> 00:29:32.433
weaker than normal, at least
in the Eastern Tropical

00:29:32.433 --> 00:29:35.500
Pacific, and that gave rise to
the or that was consistent

00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:37.667
with the La Nina situation
[Correction: The diagram shows

00:29:37.667 --> 00:29:37.800
stronger trades near the
dateline and weaker trades in

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:37.833
the eastern Pacific.

00:29:37.833 --> 00:29:39.333
La Nina is consistent with
the former anomaly.].

00:29:39.333 --> 00:29:41.700
Now what's going on beneath
the surface in

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:44.167
this month of 2011?

00:29:44.167 --> 00:29:47.867
Again, trying to understand how
to understand these maps.

00:29:51.067 --> 00:29:54.733
Here is the temperature anomaly
in degrees Celsius for

00:29:54.733 --> 00:29:56.733
a few days ago.

00:29:56.733 --> 00:29:59.200
From the TAO array.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:03.900
And there is warmer than usual
ocean water beneath the

00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:07.267
surface, but not much of an
anomaly at the surface in the

00:30:07.267 --> 00:30:09.033
Western Tropical Pacific.

00:30:09.033 --> 00:30:12.433
However, in the Eastern Tropical
Pacific, cold beneath

00:30:12.433 --> 00:30:14.667
the surface, but also
at the surface.

00:30:14.667 --> 00:30:17.333
And we see it here expressed
in a vertical section where

00:30:17.333 --> 00:30:21.100
the thermocline is there
allowing that cold water to

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.933
come up to the surface.

00:30:22.933 --> 00:30:27.833
And that, again, is consistent
with the La Nina situation

00:30:27.833 --> 00:30:32.233
that we saw here with colder
conditions in the Eastern

00:30:32.233 --> 00:30:34.467
Tropical Pacific.

00:30:34.467 --> 00:30:40.567
So I think that is everything
about El Nino.

00:30:40.567 --> 00:30:43.733
And we can stop and discuss
this for a few minutes.

00:30:43.733 --> 00:30:45.300
Are there some questions
about El Nino?

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:45.567
Yeah.

00:30:45.567 --> 00:30:49.167
STUDENT: So when you say it's
an El Nino time, you're not

00:30:49.167 --> 00:30:52.133
talking about the whole year,
you're have to be talking

00:30:52.133 --> 00:30:53.633
about-it would be kind of a
specific period of time?

00:30:53.633 --> 00:30:54.600
Does it change during--?

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:55.867
PROFESSOR: Yeah, let me be clear on that.

00:30:55.867 --> 00:30:59.767
So usually when you start an
El Nino it starts around

00:30:59.767 --> 00:31:04.800
Christmastime, but then it could
last a few months or

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.967
even a year.

00:31:06.967 --> 00:31:09.333
So we would refer to that full
period of time, as long as it

00:31:09.333 --> 00:31:12.667
persists, as the
El Nino period.

00:31:12.667 --> 00:31:17.233
I think I showed you a case
where it lasted longer than--

00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:24.467
for example, well that one there
was really, it extended

00:31:24.467 --> 00:31:27.333
about a year and a half.

00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:33.033
Whereas that one was really gone
in less than one year.

00:31:33.033 --> 00:31:36.133
And this one you had kind of a
weak one, but it persisted

00:31:36.133 --> 00:31:40.333
actually for several years.

00:31:40.333 --> 00:31:44.333
So this comes back to the
question of predictability.

00:31:44.333 --> 00:31:45.800
It's kind of random.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:50.633
And when you go into a El
Nino, you're not sure if

00:31:50.633 --> 00:31:53.033
you're going to come right
back out of it.

00:31:53.033 --> 00:31:56.000
It could kind of diddle along
for a while in a weak El Nino

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.133
and last a bit longer.

00:31:58.133 --> 00:32:05.133
But I'd say more times than not
it's over in about a year.

00:32:05.133 --> 00:32:07.033
You come out of that thing
about 12 months after

00:32:07.033 --> 00:32:09.467
you went into it.

00:32:09.467 --> 00:32:11.433
Does that help, Rachel?

00:32:11.433 --> 00:32:12.000
Other questions?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.800
Yes, Victoria.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.233
STUDENT: If it's not an El
Nino, is it always an El

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:15.900
Nino--La Nina?

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:17.467
PROFESSOR: Well so this is confusing.

00:32:17.467 --> 00:32:19.733
The terminology has changed
a bit on this.

00:32:19.733 --> 00:32:24.400
Originally, there was normal
and there was El Nino.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.400
Those were the two
things we heard

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.033
scientists talking about.

00:32:29.033 --> 00:32:32.567
Some clever individual decided
that they should think of this

00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:36.533
as really a yin/yang situation
where it was one thing or

00:32:36.533 --> 00:32:37.667
another, rather than normal.

00:32:37.667 --> 00:32:40.033
So if you're going to come up
with something that's the

00:32:40.033 --> 00:32:44.500
opposite of El Nino, well it's
going to be La Nina.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:47.667
I don't like it myself, but now
it's already embedded in

00:32:47.667 --> 00:32:50.333
the literature as being kind of
the opposite extreme with a

00:32:50.333 --> 00:32:51.733
range of normal in between.

00:32:51.733 --> 00:32:55.933
So current terminology
would be El Nino--

00:32:55.933 --> 00:32:56.867
well, it's here--

00:32:56.867 --> 00:33:00.300
El Nino, normal if you're,
say, within one standard

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:02.500
deviation or so of this.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:07.567
And then La Nina you're down
in the other extreme.

00:33:07.567 --> 00:33:10.600
So if you read the literature
over the years, you see that

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.467
terminology shift
a little bit.

00:33:12.467 --> 00:33:15.200
But don't be confused
about it.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.133
In the old days, everything like
this was normal and that

00:33:18.133 --> 00:33:19.467
was El Nino.

00:33:19.467 --> 00:33:24.533
Today it's El Nino, a range of
normal, and then La Nina out

00:33:24.533 --> 00:33:27.100
the other side.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:27.467
Yes.

00:33:27.467 --> 00:33:29.900
STUDENT: When you showed us the
trade winds diagram and

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:34.233
the anomalies, didn't you say
that when they had strong

00:33:34.233 --> 00:33:36.700
winds it was a El Nino?

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.667
But what you drew is--?

00:33:38.667 --> 00:33:39.967
PROFESSOR: Let's go back and check that because I

00:33:39.967 --> 00:33:41.833
may have misspoken.

00:33:41.833 --> 00:33:48.700
So what I'm claiming over here
is that the La Nina, this

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.867
normal situation with
colder water, has a

00:33:51.867 --> 00:33:55.300
stronger trade winds.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.467
And--yeah, maybe that
was opposite--

00:33:56.467 --> 00:33:58.000
let's go back and look at
that diagram and see

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.967
if I have that right.

00:34:00.967 --> 00:34:02.833
Thanks for pointing that out.

00:34:02.833 --> 00:34:04.433
Let's see, that diagram was--

00:34:07.767 --> 00:34:09.033
yeah.

00:34:11.733 --> 00:34:13.567
My computer has locked here.

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:28.267
Here, was it?

00:34:28.267 --> 00:34:30.900
Yeah.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:35.000
Yeah, so it may be I put the
emphasis on the Eastern part,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.567
maybe I shouldn't
have done that.

00:34:37.567 --> 00:34:41.333
We expect that during a La Nina
situation we have strong

00:34:41.333 --> 00:34:43.933
trade winds.

00:34:43.933 --> 00:34:45.933
And that would probably
correspond to this.

00:34:45.933 --> 00:34:47.933
This is the anomaly.

00:34:47.933 --> 00:34:50.433
So over the Central Pacific not
the Eastern Pacific over

00:34:50.433 --> 00:34:52.367
the Central Pacific
we had stronger

00:34:52.367 --> 00:34:53.300
than usual trade winds.

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:54.533
STUDENT: So that's stronger,
the negative?

00:34:57.367 --> 00:34:59.133
PROFESSOR: Negative would be 
remember, trade winds

00:34:59.133 --> 00:35:05.333
are from East to West. So when
you see a negative anomaly in

00:35:05.333 --> 00:35:09.500
a region which is normally
negative, that means it's a

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.833
stronger Easterly wind.

00:35:13.833 --> 00:35:15.767
STUDENT: Is it measuring
wind speek, or--?

00:35:15.767 --> 00:35:17.967
PROFESSOR: No, it's
not--it's U, it's the

00:35:17.967 --> 00:35:19.867
East-West components
of the wind.

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:23.000
Remember when you did the
balloon lab and you plotted up

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.600
the data from your pilot
balloon, you plotted U, which

00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.067
was positive towards, with the
wind toward the East, negative

00:35:33.067 --> 00:35:34.867
towards the West. It's
that convention

00:35:34.867 --> 00:35:37.133
that we're using here.

00:35:37.133 --> 00:35:39.833
You can be sure of that because
this is the normal

00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:43.267
situation and those numbers are
negative, indicating that

00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:47.067
that's an Easterly wind blowing
towards the West.

00:35:47.067 --> 00:35:51.467
That's the negative sense of
this quantity U that I'm

00:35:51.467 --> 00:35:52.033
discussing.

00:35:52.033 --> 00:35:52.367
Yes.

00:35:52.367 --> 00:35:54.867
STUDENT: Where are the
hectoPascals coming from?

00:35:54.867 --> 00:35:56.367
Is that what hPa stands for?

00:36:03.433 --> 00:36:06.267
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's a pressure unit.

00:36:06.267 --> 00:36:09.633
They're referring to the level
at which this is measured.

00:36:09.633 --> 00:36:13.633
So this is at the--this is
not at the sea surface.

00:36:13.633 --> 00:36:18.700
This is the 850 hectoPascal
level, which is about a

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:22.833
kilometer and a half above
the ocean surface.

00:36:22.833 --> 00:36:25.667
Remember again, when you're
doing the balloon lab and you

00:36:25.667 --> 00:36:28.933
plotted things with altitude,
very often atmospheric

00:36:28.933 --> 00:36:32.667
scientists use pressure as their
indication of how high

00:36:32.667 --> 00:36:34.933
you are in the atmosphere.

00:36:34.933 --> 00:36:39.400
So this is data not at the sea
surface, but about 1,500

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:46.367
meters above the sea surface, at
the 850 hectoPascal level.

00:36:46.367 --> 00:36:46.900
Good question.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:47.167
Yeah.

00:36:47.167 --> 00:36:49.467
STUDENT: What is this
map called again?

00:36:49.467 --> 00:36:51.367
PROFESSOR: Well it's
called a Hovmuller diagram.

00:36:51.367 --> 00:36:56.767
H-O-V-M-U-L-L-E-R. Hovmuller
diagram.

00:36:56.767 --> 00:36:58.167
And it's used commonly in

00:36:58.167 --> 00:37:00.600
atmospheric and oceanic sciences.

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.700
Whenever you want to see
how data along a

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:07.700
line varies with time.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:10.800
So it wouldn't always have
to be longitude.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.633
You could construct
some other line.

00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:16.167
But in this case, they've chosen
East-West as their

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:19.733
linear dimension, and
then time going up

00:37:19.733 --> 00:37:22.000
as their time dimension.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.800
Other questions on this?

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.167
Yes.

00:37:28.167 --> 00:37:31.167
STUDENT: Would you go over
why it's negative?

00:37:31.167 --> 00:37:35.300
PROFESSOR: Why these
numbers are negative?

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:40.867
The convention is for this
quantity U, it's positive when

00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:44.333
the wind blows toward the East,
and negative when it

00:37:44.333 --> 00:37:52.300
blows towards the West. You do
see a little bit of positive

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.667
wind near the edges.

00:37:55.667 --> 00:38:00.533
But over the vast majority of
the Central Tropical Pacific

00:38:00.533 --> 00:38:05.567
you have the trade winds, and
that is a wind that blows from

00:38:05.567 --> 00:38:08.767
East to West. We call them
Easterlies because of where

00:38:08.767 --> 00:38:12.333
they're blowing from, and with
this U convention that's a

00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:15.267
negative on the sign
convention.

00:38:19.967 --> 00:38:22.667
I'm glad you asked that because
this is confusing with

00:38:22.667 --> 00:38:25.833
those signs there.

00:38:25.833 --> 00:38:28.900
Other questions on
these diagrams?

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.733
STUDENT: And the one to the
right is during an El Nino?

00:38:32.733 --> 00:38:33.533
PROFESSOR: Well the one on the

00:38:33.533 --> 00:38:36.033
right is the anomaly.

00:38:36.033 --> 00:38:39.800
So what they've done is taken
this data and subtracted off

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:45.733
the normal, the long-term
average, to get an anomaly.

00:38:45.733 --> 00:38:51.500
So when you find a positive
anomaly, that would be a

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.533
weaker trade wind.

00:38:55.533 --> 00:38:57.567
It's only two meters
per second where

00:38:57.567 --> 00:38:58.767
this was six and eight.

00:38:58.767 --> 00:39:02.267
So what that's going to do is
basically drop the strength of

00:39:02.267 --> 00:39:05.233
the trade winds by a couple of
meters per second, but keep

00:39:05.233 --> 00:39:08.200
them going towards the West.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:11.667
STUDENT: So those values are the
actual speed or are they

00:39:11.667 --> 00:39:13.167
the difference from
the average?

00:39:13.167 --> 00:39:15.100
PROFESSOR: They are
the difference, they are the

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.733
actual minus the average.

00:39:18.733 --> 00:39:21.800
I haven't shown you the average
here, but these

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:27.967
numbers are this number minus
whatever is the normal wind at

00:39:27.967 --> 00:39:29.833
that--at each location.

00:39:38.267 --> 00:39:39.533
Anything else on El Nino?

00:39:45.533 --> 00:39:47.000
So I think we have
a few minutes to

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.133
start the next subject.

00:39:49.133 --> 00:39:50.367
Let me find this--

00:40:02.033 --> 00:40:03.433
We won't get very
far into this.

00:40:06.033 --> 00:40:14.267
The subject which comes next
in the course is ice.

00:40:14.267 --> 00:40:16.800
So it's a little odd because
we're jumping from El Nino,

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:21.000
which is primarily a Tropical
phenomenon, to the study of

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.900
ice in the climate system,
which is primarily a high

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:25.333
latitude subject.

00:40:25.333 --> 00:40:28.300
But they're both very important
in the way the

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:32.100
atmosphere and the ocean work
to form our climate.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:36.933
I wanted to first just run
through a set of definitions

00:40:36.933 --> 00:40:40.967
for the different types of ice
that we'll be interested in.

00:40:40.967 --> 00:40:47.433
Sea ice is frozen seawater,
where you take seawater, you

00:40:47.433 --> 00:40:51.900
blow cold wind over it, you draw
the heat out of it, you

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:54.133
bring it down to the freezing
point, and then

00:40:54.133 --> 00:40:55.667
eventually you freeze it.

00:40:55.667 --> 00:40:58.700
That is sea ice.

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:03.933
Ice sheets, like Greenland and
Antarctica, are large plateaus

00:41:03.933 --> 00:41:08.600
of ice formed from
compacted snow.

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:11.800
Snow that fell month after
month, year after year, piled

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.700
up, squeezed, compressed
to form ice.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:16.867
So the origins of these
two things are

00:41:16.867 --> 00:41:18.067
almost completely different.

00:41:18.067 --> 00:41:21.533
In one case you freeze seawater,
the other case you

00:41:21.533 --> 00:41:24.133
just compact snow.

00:41:24.133 --> 00:41:30.433
Glaciers are streams
of moving ice.

00:41:30.433 --> 00:41:32.533
They're moving under the
influence of gravity.

00:41:32.533 --> 00:41:36.633
So normally if you've got a
snow fall on the top of a

00:41:36.633 --> 00:41:40.533
mountain that builds up, after
a while it gets deep enough,

00:41:40.533 --> 00:41:43.700
it begins to be pulled
gravitational down the slopes

00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.033
of the mountain.

00:41:46.033 --> 00:41:52.233
Ice shelves are fixed,
floating ice sheets.

00:41:52.233 --> 00:41:56.367
They're basically ice that's
come off an ice sheet, flowed

00:41:56.367 --> 00:41:59.233
down to sea level in a glacier,
and then has spread

00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:05.767
out over the ocean surface
still fixed to the land.

00:42:05.767 --> 00:42:08.767
I'll show you diagrams
of all of these.

00:42:08.767 --> 00:42:10.600
Icebergs, I'm sure you
know that one.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:16.133
Those are chunks of drifting,
floating ice broken off from

00:42:16.133 --> 00:42:18.100
glaciers or ice shelves.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.333
And then, of course, on land,
you can have permanent or

00:42:20.333 --> 00:42:23.367
seasonal snow fields, just
areas that have received

00:42:23.367 --> 00:42:26.267
either just snow for that winter
and it's going to melt

00:42:26.267 --> 00:42:30.300
off the next summer, or snow
that is able to persist over

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.933
the summer season and still be
there the next year would be

00:42:33.933 --> 00:42:36.833
called a permanent snow field.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:44.300
So these are important terms
in the descriptions I'll be

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:48.267
going through mostly
next time.

00:42:48.267 --> 00:42:49.467
These are equally important.

00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:53.567
These are the physical
properties of ice that we'll

00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:57.533
need to know in order to
understand the way ice works

00:42:57.533 --> 00:42:59.367
in the climate system.

00:42:59.367 --> 00:43:03.400
First of all, there's
this latent heat

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.633
of melting or freezing.

00:43:07.633 --> 00:43:09.467
You can look it up,
you can Google it.

00:43:09.467 --> 00:43:15.300
The value is 334,000 Joules
per kilogram.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:20.500
Every time you take water and
freeze it, you have to remove

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.967
that much heat.

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:27.233
And every time you take ice and
melt it, you have to put

00:43:27.233 --> 00:43:30.233
that same amount of
heat back in.

00:43:30.233 --> 00:43:32.300
So it's a reversible process.

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:36.767
That number applies to either
melting or freezing.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:40.833
And you can do that in
a variety of ways.

00:43:40.833 --> 00:43:44.167
You can radiate that heat away,
you can have cold winds

00:43:44.167 --> 00:43:47.800
or warm winds, provide that
heat, or remove that heat.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.200
But in any case, whenever you're
melting or creating

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:53.667
ice, you've got to deal with
that amount of heat.

00:43:53.667 --> 00:43:54.767
It's a large number.

00:43:54.767 --> 00:43:58.533
It's not as large as the latent
heat of condensation.

00:43:58.533 --> 00:44:01.033
Remember, the latent heat of
condensation was many times

00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:02.767
that number.

00:44:02.767 --> 00:44:05.833
You might want to look back and
see what that number was.

00:44:05.833 --> 00:44:09.167
This is still big, but it's not
as big as a number needed

00:44:09.167 --> 00:44:14.067
to condense water or
to evaporate water.

00:44:14.067 --> 00:44:16.833
I want to remind you also that
while the freezing point of

00:44:16.833 --> 00:44:21.400
fresh water is zero degrees
Celsius in fact, that's the

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:27.100
basis on which the Celsius
scale is defined for salt

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:30.400
water with a salinity of
approximately 35 parts per

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.800
thousand, that freezing point
is depressed to about minus

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.600
two Celsius.

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.733
You'd have to cool the water a
bit colder if it's sea water

00:44:40.733 --> 00:44:41.967
before it'll start to freeze.

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.233
This third bullet, I'm sure you
know this, but I want to

00:44:48.233 --> 00:44:51.967
impress on you how
remarkable it is.

00:44:51.967 --> 00:44:56.967
Most objects, most materials,
when you freeze them from the

00:44:56.967 --> 00:45:01.867
liquid they reduce
their volume.

00:45:01.867 --> 00:45:04.933
That is, they become
more dense.

00:45:04.933 --> 00:45:08.533
Almost every subject known
to man does that.

00:45:08.533 --> 00:45:11.333
Water is one of the very few
exceptions that when you

00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:14.733
freeze it it actually expands.

00:45:14.733 --> 00:45:16.633
I think the only other
one that I know that

00:45:16.633 --> 00:45:19.700
does this is bismuth.

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:24.067
Bismuth has that same property
of water as when you condense

00:45:24.067 --> 00:45:27.500
it from the liquid to the solid
it actually expands.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:33.067
Now you know this, because if
you leave a bottle of water

00:45:33.067 --> 00:45:36.667
out on a cold night and it
freezes, it'll expand and

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:38.000
break the jar.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.267
So you know it's expanding.

00:45:39.267 --> 00:45:43.000
You also know it because when
you drop an ice cube into a

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.733
glass of water, it doesn't sink
to the bottom, it floats

00:45:45.733 --> 00:45:46.467
on the top.

00:45:46.467 --> 00:45:48.700
You're so accustomed to seeing
that, but I want you to kind

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.800
of marvel at that the next
time you see it.

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:56.867
That the solid is actually less
dense then the liquid.

00:45:56.867 --> 00:45:59.767
It's a very rare circumstance,
it's a very rare situation.

00:45:59.767 --> 00:46:03.533
But it's very controlling in
the way ice works in the

00:46:03.533 --> 00:46:04.233
climate system.

00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:07.533
The fact that it floats on top
of the ocean, for example,

00:46:07.533 --> 00:46:09.133
rather than sinking
to the bottom.

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:11.100
It changes everything in
terms of the way the

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.800
climate system works.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:19.567
So a typical density for ice
is about 917 kilograms per

00:46:19.567 --> 00:46:22.300
cubic meter.

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:25.700
Typical density for fresh
water is about 1,000.

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.433
Typical density for sea
water's about 1,025.

00:46:29.433 --> 00:46:34.067
So this is less dense than both
of those, and would float

00:46:34.067 --> 00:46:38.933
either in fresh water
or in seawater.

00:46:38.933 --> 00:46:40.167
Any questions on that?

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:43.467
This is an interesting one.

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:48.233
If you've got a bucket of
seawater and you freeze it, or

00:46:48.233 --> 00:46:54.367
start to freeze it, as the water
freezes, it'll expel

00:46:54.367 --> 00:46:56.967
most of the salt.

00:46:56.967 --> 00:47:00.900
So that if you take a chunk of
that ice that you formed and

00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:05.367
melt it, the salinity is going
to be far less than the salt

00:47:05.367 --> 00:47:06.467
water it was made from.

00:47:06.467 --> 00:47:07.633
I'll give you an example.

00:47:07.633 --> 00:47:10.133
If you start with a bucket of
ocean water with a salinity of

00:47:10.133 --> 00:47:16.000
say, 35 parts per thousand, and
you froze it very slowly,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.100
you could actually generate
ice that when melted had a

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:22.933
salinity of perhaps only
5 parts per thousand.

00:47:22.933 --> 00:47:25.533
It really does expel most
of the salt when

00:47:25.533 --> 00:47:28.333
you freeze that water.

00:47:28.333 --> 00:47:31.567
And that plays a big role, as
you might imagine, in the way

00:47:31.567 --> 00:47:33.067
the Arctic Ocean works.

00:47:33.067 --> 00:47:39.133
When you form sea ice, the water
beneath it gets saltier

00:47:39.133 --> 00:47:44.467
because you've expelled that
salt into the ocean.

00:47:44.467 --> 00:47:46.833
The Inuit people know this.

00:47:46.833 --> 00:47:55.000
When they're out travelling over
the sea ice hunting, if

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.367
they need water, well, you could
dig a hole through the

00:47:58.367 --> 00:48:02.633
ice and get sea water to drink,
but humans cannot live

00:48:02.633 --> 00:48:04.933
on seawater, it's too salty.

00:48:04.933 --> 00:48:07.800
But they could knock
off a chunk of--

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.800
of course, the best thing would
be if there's snow.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.033
If there's snow on top
of the ice, gather

00:48:12.033 --> 00:48:12.967
that up and melt it.

00:48:12.967 --> 00:48:14.833
That'll be fresh water.

00:48:14.833 --> 00:48:18.600
But if there's no snow on the
ice, take a chunk of the sea

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.000
ice and melt it down and
you could live on that.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.533
It's not very tasty, it's
brackish water, but you could

00:48:24.533 --> 00:48:29.233
live on that because it's enough
fresher than the ocean

00:48:29.233 --> 00:48:33.767
water was, that the human can
exist on that particular kind

00:48:33.767 --> 00:48:35.200
of brackish water.

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.233
So this is important.

00:48:37.233 --> 00:48:41.400
For climate purposes it's
important that ice and snow is

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:45.367
highly reflective of sunlight.

00:48:45.367 --> 00:48:50.200
The typical albedo for
ocean water is

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:53.333
something less than 0.1.

00:48:53.333 --> 00:48:58.067
It absorbs more than 90% of
the light that hits it.

00:48:58.067 --> 00:49:04.700
On land, a more typical albedo
is something like .2, 0.2.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:08.233
But yet for ice and snow, the
albedo is more like 0.8.

00:49:08.233 --> 00:49:12.100
In other words, something like
80% of the radiation that hits

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:14.233
it is reflected back to space.

00:49:14.233 --> 00:49:16.933
And that, as you can imagine,
albedos playing such an

00:49:16.933 --> 00:49:19.667
important role in climate,
that's an important role for

00:49:19.667 --> 00:49:24.000
ice controlling the albedo
of the surface.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.600
And the last one I want to
mention is that ice, while we

00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:29.933
think of it as something
brittle, when you take a chunk

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:33.200
of ice and hit it with a hammer,
it will shatter.

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.233
When it's under high enough
pressure it'll flow like a

00:49:36.233 --> 00:49:38.600
liquid, like a viscous liquid.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:41.400
And we'll talk about that when
it comes to how glaciers and

00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:42.333
ice sheets move.

00:49:42.333 --> 00:49:46.033
So review these and we'll start
on the description of

00:49:46.033 --> 00:49:48.400
ice and the climate
system next time.

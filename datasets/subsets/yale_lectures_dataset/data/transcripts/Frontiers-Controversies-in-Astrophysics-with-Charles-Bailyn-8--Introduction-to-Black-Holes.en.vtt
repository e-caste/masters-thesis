00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.985
Professor Charles
Bailyn: Okay,

00:00:04.985 --> 00:00:08.930
welcome to the second part of
Astro 160.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.970
This is going to be about black
holes and relativity.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.650
And just to give you kind of a
preview, the whole point of

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.879
black holes is that,
of course, they emit no light,

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:22.459
so you can't see them directly.
And so, the question arises,

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:24.250
"How do you know that they're
there?"

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.730
And the reason you can
demonstrate that black holes

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.628
exist is because they're in
orbit around other things and

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:35.456
you can see the motion of the
other things that interact

00:00:35.456 --> 00:00:38.380
gravitationally with the black
hole.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.550
This concept should be
familiar, to a certain extent,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.903
because it's exactly the same
thing we've been doing for

00:00:44.903 --> 00:00:47.980
discovering exoplanets.
You don't see the exoplanet

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.243
directly.
What happens is that there's

00:00:50.243 --> 00:00:54.081
something else that you can see
that's affected by the presence

00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.970
of the exoplanet.
So, exactly the same thing

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:01.337
happens with black holes.
And so, we're going to use the

00:01:01.337 --> 00:01:04.325
same equations,
the same concepts,

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:08.129
to explore this very different
context.

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:17.460
So, black holes can't be seen
directly.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.885
And so, instead of detecting
them directly,

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:34.367
you use this combination of
orbital dynamics and things like

00:01:34.367 --> 00:01:40.200
the Doppler shift to infer their
presence,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.973
and more than just inferring
their presence,

00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:46.687
to infer their properties.
Now, the context is more

00:01:46.687 --> 00:01:49.922
complicated.
And, in particular,

00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:56.763
we're no longer going to be
using Newton's laws – Newton's

00:01:56.763 --> 00:01:59.802
Law of Gravity,
Newton's Laws of

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:03.138
Motion--because there is a more
comprehensive theory that

00:02:03.138 --> 00:02:05.922
replaced Newton,
which is necessary to

00:02:05.922 --> 00:02:10.324
understand these things.
That more complex theory is

00:02:10.324 --> 00:02:13.300
Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.083
So, we're going to be using
some relativity rather than

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:27.599
Newtonian physics.
This gets weird very fast, okay?

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.460
And so, I'm not going to start
there.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.837
I'm going to start with a kind
of Newtonian explanation for

00:02:32.837 --> 00:02:35.145
what black holes are,
we'll do that this time,

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:37.819
and then the weirdness will
start on Thursday.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.673
So, the first concept and the
easiest way, I think,

00:02:43.673 --> 00:02:49.878
to understand black holes is
the concept of the escape

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.907
velocity.
This is a piece of high school

00:02:52.907 --> 00:02:54.178
physics.
Some of you may have

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:57.553
encountered it before.
And it just means how fast you

00:02:57.553 --> 00:03:02.338
have to go to escape from the
gravitational field of a given

00:03:02.338 --> 00:03:04.839
object.
If you go outside and you shoot

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:08.109
up a rocket ship or something
like that, how fast do you have

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.379
to shoot it up so that it
doesn't fall back to the Earth?

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:14.560
And so, you can define an
escape velocity for the Earth,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.990
or for any other object for
that matter,

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.733
which is just how fast you have
to go to escape its

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:22.467
gravitational field.
There is an equation associated

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:24.576
with this.
It looks like this,

00:03:24.576 --> 00:03:28.946
V_escape,
that's the escape velocity,

00:03:28.946 --> 00:03:32.740
2GM / R all to
the 1/2 power.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:48.181
And this is the speed required
to escape the gravitational

00:03:48.181 --> 00:03:56.731
field of an object;
supposing that the object has

00:03:56.731 --> 00:04:01.960
mass equal to M and
radius equal to R.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.715
Oh, one other assumption,
I'm assuming here that you're

00:04:05.715 --> 00:04:10.026
standing on the--that you start
from standing on the surface of

00:04:10.026 --> 00:04:18.040
the object.
If you are on the surface.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.331
Okay.
This equation should look

00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:27.660
vaguely, but not a hundred
percent familiar to you,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.476
because you derived something
that looked a lot like it on the

00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:34.155
second problem set,
where you worked out the

00:04:34.155 --> 00:04:37.286
relationship between the
semi-major axis of an orbit and

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:40.529
the speed and object had to go
in to be in that orbit,

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.983
and what--the way that
calculation worked out it was

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:47.639
the velocity equals GM
over the semi-major axis,

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:50.735
a.
So that 2 wasn't there in that

00:04:50.735 --> 00:04:54.723
derivation, but otherwise,
the form of this is actually

00:04:54.723 --> 00:04:59.218
quite similar to that.
And so, let me explain why that

00:04:59.218 --> 00:05:02.339
is.
Here's some object.

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:08.529
It's got a radius of R
and a mass of M.

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:13.356
And imagine that you've got
something that's in orbit around

00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:18.019
this object, but it's in orbit
right above the surface.

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:20.290
It's just skimming the surface
of the thing.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.206
That would be impossible in the
case of Earth,

00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:24.889
because the friction from the
atmosphere would slow you down,

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.810
but in a planet without an
atmosphere, this would be

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:29.886
possible.
Imagine you're just sort of

00:05:29.886 --> 00:05:32.779
skimming over the tops of the
mountains, or whatever.

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:36.209
So here you are in orbit,
this is something in a nice

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:39.705
circular orbit right above the
surface of this object,

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:43.528
and it's going around.
And it's got some velocity,

00:05:43.528 --> 00:05:47.199
which I'm going to call the
circular velocity.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.064
And as we calculated in the
previous section of the course,

00:05:52.064 --> 00:05:56.004
that's GM / a,
which is, in this case,

00:05:56.004 --> 00:05:59.660
GM / R, because
you're skimming the surface,

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.392
to the 1/2 power.
So that's how fast you have to

00:06:03.392 --> 00:06:06.120
go to stay in orbit.
If you go slower than

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.360
that--let's take a different
color, here.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.074
If you go slower than that,
you crash into the surface

00:06:12.074 --> 00:06:14.686
right away, because you
don't--you're not going fast

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:18.559
enough to stay in orbit.
So, that's what happens in the

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:23.600
case--if you have a velocity
less than the circular velocity.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.604
What happens if you're going
faster than the circular

00:06:26.604 --> 00:06:29.213
velocity?
Well, you're going so fast that

00:06:29.213 --> 00:06:31.759
you move further away from this
object.

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:33.440
You don't stay skimming the
surface.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.500
So, here you are,
going a little bit faster.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.282
And now you're not in a
circular orbit and your orbit

00:06:40.282 --> 00:06:44.720
ends up looking something like
this--nice elliptical orbit.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:50.616
And this is a velocity greater
than the circular velocity,

00:06:50.616 --> 00:06:56.616
but still less than the escape
velocity because you haven't

00:06:56.616 --> 00:07:01.506
escaped the gravitational field,
because you're still in an

00:07:01.506 --> 00:07:03.009
orbit.
It's an elliptical orbit now,

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:05.470
but you're still in an orbit,
and it'll come back to the same

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:09.078
place.
Now, if you're going at

00:07:09.078 --> 00:07:15.837
somewhat faster than that at the
escape velocity,

00:07:15.837 --> 00:07:24.112
then you never come back.
You continue all the way out to

00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:27.273
infinity.
Your orbit continues to change

00:07:27.273 --> 00:07:30.800
direction a little bit due to
the gravitational force of this

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.091
thing.
You continue to slow down,

00:07:33.091 --> 00:07:35.530
but in the end you never come
back.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:40.625
So, it's a non-repeating orbit.
And, if you're going even

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:48.739
faster than the escape velocity,
then you get to infinity even

00:07:48.739 --> 00:07:51.812
faster.
And, more importantly,

00:07:51.812 --> 00:07:55.376
when you get there,
you're still moving pretty

00:07:55.376 --> 00:07:58.610
fast.
This, you gradually slow down.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.853
So, all of these different
kinds of orbits--the one that

00:08:02.853 --> 00:08:06.304
crashes into the planet,
the one that skims the planet,

00:08:06.304 --> 00:08:08.953
the one that's an elliptical
orbit, the one that escapes

00:08:08.953 --> 00:08:12.035
altogether--those are all within
a factor of the square root of 2

00:08:12.035 --> 00:08:15.254
of each other.
Because, remember,

00:08:15.254 --> 00:08:21.527
the escape velocity here is
equal to (2GM /

00:08:21.527 --> 00:08:26.054
R)^(1/2).
So, just by increasing your

00:08:26.054 --> 00:08:30.009
orbital speed by a factor of the
square root of 2,

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:32.794
you go from being in a nice
circular orbit to escaping the

00:08:32.794 --> 00:08:35.090
gravitational field of the
object altogether.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:39.570
So, you can calculate escape
velocities of things.

00:08:39.570 --> 00:08:45.560
Let's do that once.
The escape velocity of

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:52.194
Earth--that would be--the escape
is (2GM /

00:08:52.194 --> 00:08:57.586
R)^(1/2).
2G = 7 x 10^(-11)

00:08:57.586 --> 00:09:04.270
M is, for the Earth,
is 6 x 10^(24) R for the

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:08.649
Earth is something like 7 x
10^(6).

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:11.060
This all has to be taken to the
½ power.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.440
The 7s cancel.
What do we have here?

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:25.712
Let's see, 12 x 10^(13).
24 - 11 over 10^(6) 1/2--let's

00:09:25.712 --> 00:09:32.607
see, that's 1.2.
14 - 6 = 8, times 10^(8),

00:09:32.607 --> 00:09:36.167
to the 1/2.
That's something like 10^(4)

00:09:36.167 --> 00:09:39.162
meters per second,
because I've used the value of

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:42.470
G that's appropriate for
meters per second.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:47.059
So, that's about 10 kilometers
a second.

00:09:47.059 --> 00:09:48.840
So, that's the escape velocity
of the Earth.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.952
If you go outside,
you throw a football up into

00:09:50.952 --> 00:09:53.616
the air at 10 kilometers per
second, it's not going to come

00:09:53.616 --> 00:09:59.879
back down.
Try it--good exercise.

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:03.629
Okay, you could calculate the
escape velocity of any

00:10:03.629 --> 00:10:08.961
particular object.
You could calculate the escape

00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:14.240
velocity of the human being--of
a human.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.447
A human has a mass of 100
kilograms, a radius of about 1

00:10:18.447 --> 00:10:21.098
meter;
this is kind of a big human,

00:10:21.098 --> 00:10:23.513
but we'll go with it.
Let's see,

00:10:23.513 --> 00:10:27.990
V_escape is
equal to 2GM over--a

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:33.279
half--there's a very famous book
about physics with the title,

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:37.296
"Assume A Spherical Cow," and
this--so, this is the kind of

00:10:37.296 --> 00:10:39.720
thing that physicists like to
do.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.416
It's an idealized situation.
We have this perfectly

00:10:42.416 --> 00:10:46.259
spherical human being and--okay
so let's do the calculation,

00:10:46.259 --> 00:10:51.496
2 x 7 x 10^(-11) x 100,
that's 10^(2),

00:10:51.496 --> 00:10:59.990
over 1, to the square root.
That's 14 x 10^(-9).

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:07.868
Call it (1.4 x 10^(-8))^(1/2).
That's something like 1.2,

00:11:07.868 --> 00:11:13.809
let's call it 1.
1 x 10^(-4) meters per second.

00:11:13.809 --> 00:11:17.159
Or--let's see,
that's 1/10 of a millimeter per

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:22.968
second.
That's less than 1 meter per

00:11:22.968 --> 00:11:25.863
hour.
And that's why we don't go into

00:11:25.863 --> 00:11:28.429
orbit around each other.
Okay?

00:11:28.429 --> 00:11:31.562
Because you're always moving
way, way, way faster than the

00:11:31.562 --> 00:11:34.639
escape velocity of the people
you're interacting with.

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:38.740
The escape velocity of the
Earth is 10 kilometers a second.

00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.710
So, you're not moving that fast.
So, you're bound to the Earth.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:44.632
But when you're hanging around
with your friends,

00:11:44.632 --> 00:11:47.860
you're probably going faster
than 1 meter per hour,

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.870
and therefore you're moving
faster than the escape velocity.

00:11:51.870 --> 00:11:56.152
You don't feel a great effect
of the gravitational force of

00:11:56.152 --> 00:11:58.304
other people.
This is kind of

00:11:58.304 --> 00:12:01.159
anti-Valentine's Day
calculation, right?

00:12:01.159 --> 00:12:03.895
Because it proves that human
beings are not attracted to each

00:12:03.895 --> 00:12:06.462
other;
at least not by the force of

00:12:06.462 --> 00:12:08.905
gravity.
And so, you can do this

00:12:08.905 --> 00:12:11.470
calculation for any given
object.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.627
Fine, so what's a black hole?
Black hole has,

00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:17.590
actually, a very simple
definition.

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:21.688
A black hole is simply
something in which the escape

00:12:21.688 --> 00:12:26.350
velocity is greater than or
equal to the speed of light.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.639
c is the expression for
the speed of light.

00:12:29.639 --> 00:12:33.429
This is 3 x 10^(8) meters per
second.

00:12:33.429 --> 00:12:37.194
And, if you've got something
where the escape velocity is

00:12:37.194 --> 00:12:41.429
greater than the speed of light,
that's what a black hole is.

00:12:41.429 --> 00:12:42.909
And it makes a certain amount
of sense.

00:12:42.909 --> 00:12:46.122
If the escape velocity's
greater than the speed of light,

00:12:46.122 --> 00:12:49.507
then light won't escape this
object, so you won't be able to

00:12:49.507 --> 00:12:51.602
see it, right?
Because, the way you see

00:12:51.602 --> 00:12:53.860
something is you see the photons
that come off it.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.820
And, there's nothing
particularly extraordinary about

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:01.834
this, as far as it goes.
In fact, the middle of--this

00:13:01.834 --> 00:13:06.195
was already talked about and
worked out in some detail in the

00:13:06.195 --> 00:13:10.773
middle of the eighteenth century
by an otherwise obscure English

00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:13.781
clergyman named,
I think, John Michell,

00:13:13.781 --> 00:13:16.340
and he did the following
calculation.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.901
He said, okay now,
if this is going to be true,

00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:23.740
how big is such an object?
How dense does it have to be?

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:27.640
And, you can work this out.
Supposing the escape velocity

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.199
is equal to the speed of
light--so c = (2GM

00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:36.697
/ R) ^(1/2).
You can square both sides and

00:13:36.697 --> 00:13:42.299
regroup, and you have R =
2GM / c^(2).

00:13:42.299 --> 00:13:45.473
This is now--wasn't called this
in the eighteenth century,

00:13:45.473 --> 00:13:48.090
but it's now called the
Schwarzschild radius.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:52.050
Schwarzschild was a
contemporary of Einstein.

00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:59.472
And, this is the size something
has to be in order for its

00:13:59.472 --> 00:14:03.169
escape velocity to be equal to
the speed of light.

00:14:03.169 --> 00:14:07.301
And a black hole--another
definition of a black hole is

00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:11.815
something in which the radius of
the object is less than the

00:14:11.815 --> 00:14:16.100
Schwarzschild radius--because if
the radius is less,

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.039
then the escape velocity will
be even greater.

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:22.877
So as I say,
this was worked out in

00:14:22.877 --> 00:14:25.524
obscurity in the middle of the
eighteenth century,

00:14:25.524 --> 00:14:28.009
and nobody thought anything
much about it.

00:14:28.009 --> 00:14:30.383
Michell sort of pondered for a
little bit what such an object

00:14:30.383 --> 00:14:32.123
would look like,
and he decided it would look

00:14:32.123 --> 00:14:36.379
dark.
And true enough, but who cares.

00:14:36.379 --> 00:14:40.814
And nobody thought anything
further about it for 150 years

00:14:40.814 --> 00:14:45.950
until Einstein came along at the
start of the twentieth century,

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:50.600
and came up with the Theory of
Relativity.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.328
And one of the pieces,
important pieces of relativity

00:14:53.328 --> 00:14:56.299
is that the speed of light,
c is a very,

00:14:56.299 --> 00:14:59.962
very special velocity,
and has rather bizarre and

00:14:59.962 --> 00:15:04.390
extremely profound properties.
And it was only at that point

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:08.407
that the concept of the black
hole was recognized as something

00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:11.240
that was in any way out of the
ordinary.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.363
And so, for 150 years this idea
kind of lay dormant until it was

00:15:16.363 --> 00:15:20.999
resurrected by a profound change
in the thinking about the

00:15:20.999 --> 00:15:24.394
underlying physics.
So, this is one of these kinds

00:15:24.394 --> 00:15:27.190
of historical fables that we've
hit a couple of times.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:39.139
This is the fable of Michell's
discovery of black holes.

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:43.734
And the moral of this little
fable might be that the

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:48.960
importance of a result changes
depending on the context;

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:56.889
result changes,
sometimes dramatically,

00:15:56.889 --> 00:16:01.667
with context.
So, something that looks quite

00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:04.961
unimportant for a long time can
all of a sudden become a very

00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:07.943
big deal.
And so, it happened in this

00:16:07.943 --> 00:16:10.765
case.
Okay, so, one question you can

00:16:10.765 --> 00:16:14.683
ask is that's all fine,
how big is the Schwarzschild

00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:17.450
radius for some bunch of
objects?

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.815
Let's try the Sun;
here, let me start a new piece

00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:21.530
of paper.

00:16:25.039 --> 00:16:31.289
So, how big is the
Schwarzschild radius of the Sun?

00:16:31.289 --> 00:16:36.992
Schwarzschild radius,
again, 2GM /

00:16:36.992 --> 00:16:43.331
c^(2) = 2 x 7 x 10^(-11).
Mass of the Sun,

00:16:43.331 --> 00:16:47.289
now, 2 x 10^(30).
Divided by c^(2).

00:16:47.289 --> 00:16:51.320
c is 3 x 10^(8) and
we'll square it.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:59.289
Okay, so let's see,
2 x 2 = 4, times 7 is 30.

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:07.700
30 x 10^(19) 30 - 11 = 19
Divided by--3 x 3 = 10.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:13.359
(10^(8))^(2) = 10^(16).
So, that's 3 x 10^(3),

00:17:13.359 --> 00:17:19.764
because 19 - 16 = 3--oh,
in meters, because we're still

00:17:19.764 --> 00:17:25.339
in MKS units,
because that what we're using.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.750
That's the units of G
that we've chosen.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.460
3 x 10^(3);
that's 3 kilometers.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:36.718
That's pretty small for the Sun.
And so, you might imagine that

00:17:36.718 --> 00:17:41.609
such objects are rare,
or perhaps even non-existent,

00:17:41.609 --> 00:17:44.554
because it would have to be
incredibly small,

00:17:44.554 --> 00:17:46.829
and therefore,
incredibly dense,

00:17:46.829 --> 00:17:49.904
to have a strong enough
gravitational field to prevent

00:17:49.904 --> 00:17:54.065
light from escaping.
And so, you might have thought

00:17:54.065 --> 00:17:58.490
that this is an entirely
theoretical concept,

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.773
and that no matter how
interesting it is,

00:18:00.773 --> 00:18:03.569
there's no point in really
studying it further,

00:18:03.569 --> 00:18:05.997
because you're unlikely to ever
encounter one of these things in

00:18:05.997 --> 00:18:08.321
real life.
But one of the strange things

00:18:08.321 --> 00:18:11.978
that was--has been known for
quite some time is that black

00:18:11.978 --> 00:18:16.977
holes really should exist,
and that they are predicted to

00:18:16.977 --> 00:18:23.064
exist.
This has been known for quite a

00:18:23.064 --> 00:18:33.599
while--known for at 70 years,
that black holes should exist.

00:18:33.599 --> 00:18:37.888
And the reason they should is
that they are one of the

00:18:37.888 --> 00:18:42.500
possible end points of stellar
evolution--the evolution of

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:43.310
stars.

00:18:50.569 --> 00:18:54.519
And so, now I want to summarize
how stars evolve.

00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:58.137
I should say,
this is the subject of whole

00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:01.544
courses.
You can take Astro 350 and they

00:19:01.544 --> 00:19:05.289
will talk about this for the
entire semester.

00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:08.523
You can take Astro 110 and then
they'll talk about it for a

00:19:08.523 --> 00:19:10.786
month.
But we're going to do it in

00:19:10.786 --> 00:19:13.881
about twenty minutes,
save you time and effort,

00:19:13.881 --> 00:19:17.590
here.
So, a star's life is determined

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:21.579
by the competition between two
forces;

00:19:21.579 --> 00:19:32.214
so, star's lifetime and
evolution is determined by two

00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:35.007
forces.
One is gravity,

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:38.299
which has the tendency to hold
the star together.

00:19:38.299 --> 00:19:42.670
And now, the thing about
gravity is, it ought to work.

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:46.822
But stars have no solid surface.
So, if you can imagine gravity

00:19:46.822 --> 00:19:49.849
pulling on an atom on the
surface of the star,

00:19:49.849 --> 00:19:52.613
why shouldn't that atom just
fall all the way down to the

00:19:52.613 --> 00:19:54.952
bottom of the star?
Because there's no solid

00:19:54.952 --> 00:19:56.960
surface to prevent it from doing
so.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.268
And the answer is that gravity
isn't the only force operating,

00:20:00.268 --> 00:20:04.059
there's also pressure.
So, there's gravity,

00:20:04.059 --> 00:20:08.290
which pulls stuff in,
and pressure,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:13.019
which has the tendency to push
out.

00:20:13.019 --> 00:20:15.809
And these things balance in
most stars.

00:20:15.809 --> 00:20:19.123
In the Sun, for example,
these two forces are in balance

00:20:19.123 --> 00:20:23.253
at all points in the Sun,
and this balance goes by the

00:20:23.253 --> 00:20:26.830
technical name hydrostatic
equilibrium.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.349
Hydro, because it's a fluid,
it's not a solid surface.

00:20:34.349 --> 00:20:37.105
Static--nothing's moving,
and equilibrium is just

00:20:37.105 --> 00:20:39.234
balance.
And, to be a little more

00:20:39.234 --> 00:20:42.408
precise, the way this
works--here's the surface of

00:20:42.408 --> 00:20:44.992
some star.
Here's some point within the

00:20:44.992 --> 00:20:48.849
star, and there are two kinds of
forces acting on this point.

00:20:48.849 --> 00:20:51.628
There's gravity,
which is pulling the thing

00:20:51.628 --> 00:20:55.266
toward the center of the star,
and then there's pressure

00:20:55.266 --> 00:20:59.689
forces in two different ways.
The outer regions of the star

00:20:59.689 --> 00:21:03.910
exert a pressure inward.
So, there's an inward pressure.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:07.769
And the inner regions of the
star exert a pressure outward.

00:21:07.769 --> 00:21:11.615
And the outward pressure has to
be greater than the inward

00:21:11.615 --> 00:21:15.730
pressure by exactly the right
amount to counteract gravity.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:19.642
So, it basically looks like
P_out -

00:21:19.642 --> 00:21:24.895
P_in = gravity.
And this holds true at all

00:21:24.895 --> 00:21:28.943
points.
Now, in order--it's the other

00:21:28.943 --> 00:21:32.529
way around right?
Thank you.

00:21:32.529 --> 00:21:36.889
P_in -
P_out--yeah,

00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:38.546
right.
P_in minus

00:21:38.546 --> 00:21:40.190
P_out has to
equal gravity.

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:44.167
And that requires that the
pressure on the inside has to be

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:48.419
bigger than the pressure on the
outside, because you don't have

00:21:48.419 --> 00:21:51.553
negative gravity;
at least, not until the third

00:21:51.553 --> 00:21:53.924
part of this course.
But, at the moment,

00:21:53.924 --> 00:21:57.416
you don't have any negative
gravity, and so the pressure on

00:21:57.416 --> 00:22:00.547
the inside has to be greater
than the pressure on the

00:22:00.547 --> 00:22:02.539
outside.
Okay, so what is pressure?

00:22:02.539 --> 00:22:05.940
Cast your mind back to high
school chemistry.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:10.759
Remember high school chemistry?
It doesn't matter if you don't.

00:22:10.759 --> 00:22:12.619
I'll tell you everything you
need to know.

00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:16.512
There's something called an
ideal gas, and there's something

00:22:16.512 --> 00:22:20.339
that the ideal gas does,
which is to exert gas pressure.

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:24.783
Your high school chemistry
teacher probably wrote down

00:22:24.783 --> 00:22:29.646
something that looks like this:
PV = nRT. And

00:22:29.646 --> 00:22:34.950
here's the thing about this.
V is volume in this case;

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:41.875
P is the pressure;
n is the number of

00:22:41.875 --> 00:22:49.257
particles per volume.
And so, the key thing here is

00:22:49.257 --> 00:22:53.573
that n divided by
V is equal to the

00:22:53.573 --> 00:22:57.170
density, basically,
times a constant.

00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:04.140
Because, remember,
density is mass per volume.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.658
If you take the number of
particles and you multiply by

00:23:06.658 --> 00:23:09.084
the mass of each particle,
that'll give you the total

00:23:09.084 --> 00:23:10.809
amount of mass in a given
region.

00:23:10.809 --> 00:23:13.880
You divide by the volume,
that equals the density.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:17.460
And so, this also is a
constant, this R thing.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.937
And so, what you get is
P is equal to a constant,

00:23:22.937 --> 00:23:27.220
times the density,
times the temperature.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:30.692
So, this is how physicists
think of the ideal gas law,

00:23:30.692 --> 00:23:34.100
because we prefer to work in
terms of the density.

00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:39.424
Okay, so here's the pressure.
And the pressure on the inside

00:23:39.424 --> 00:23:42.089
had better be bigger than the
pressure on the outside,

00:23:42.089 --> 00:23:44.317
or this isn't going to balance,
which means,

00:23:44.317 --> 00:23:46.390
either the density or the
temperature,

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:49.586
or both, had better be larger
in the middle of the star than

00:23:49.586 --> 00:23:51.700
it is in the outer parts of the
star.

00:23:56.170 --> 00:24:02.000
So, inside of the star,
the T and/or the ρ has

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.510
to be bigger than it is on the
outside.

00:24:10.119 --> 00:24:13.269
Now, it turns out that if you
just keep the temperature

00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:16.769
constant all the way through the
star, you never achieve this

00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:21.781
balance.
So, if only the density varies,

00:24:21.781 --> 00:24:29.846
then inner regions do have
higher pressure but the increase

00:24:29.846 --> 00:24:36.799
in density also increases the
force of gravity,

00:24:36.799 --> 00:24:39.519
because gravity is dependent on
how much mass there is.

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:42.045
And, if you increase the
density, you also increase the

00:24:42.045 --> 00:24:44.469
amount of mass.
So, you have higher pressure,

00:24:44.469 --> 00:24:46.380
but you also have higher
gravity.

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:54.160
And it turns out that you can
prove, mathematically speaking,

00:24:54.160 --> 00:25:00.402
that no balance is possible,
because it always ends up being

00:25:00.402 --> 00:25:04.500
the case, for gas pressure,
that the amount you have to

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.022
increase the density by,
if you're only increasing the

00:25:08.022 --> 00:25:11.171
density, will also increase the
gravity, and you'll never get a

00:25:11.171 --> 00:25:15.926
balance.
So, the consequence of that is

00:25:15.926 --> 00:25:24.180
that the inner parts of a star
must be hotter than the outer

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.319
parts.
Otherwise, the star wouldn't

00:25:27.319 --> 00:25:28.670
exist;
it would collapse.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:33.461
And this is true.
The inside of the Sun turns out

00:25:33.461 --> 00:25:36.710
to be something like 10^(7)
degrees.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:45.204
The surface of the Sun turns
out to be something like 6 x

00:25:45.204 --> 00:25:47.480
10^(3).
So yes, indeed,

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.908
the inside very much hotter
than the Sun,

00:25:49.908 --> 00:25:52.640
that is very much hotter than
the outside,

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:55.370
in the Sun, and that's what
keeps the Sun in balance.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:26:00.809
And there's a problem with this.
And the problem is that there

00:26:00.809 --> 00:26:04.049
is something called
thermodynamics.

00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:06.915
And one of the laws of
thermodynamics is that heat

00:26:06.915 --> 00:26:10.423
tends to flow from places where
it's hot to places where it's

00:26:10.423 --> 00:26:14.721
cool.
This is evident in everyday

00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:16.901
life.
If you take a little piece of,

00:26:16.901 --> 00:26:18.601
I don't know,
molten lead or something,

00:26:18.601 --> 00:26:20.390
and you drop it in a bucket of
water,

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.529
the heat from the lead will
spread into the water.

00:26:23.529 --> 00:26:26.259
The water will increase in
temperature very slightly.

00:26:26.259 --> 00:26:29.380
The heat will come out of that
piece of lead.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.044
The lead will solidify,
and everything will come into a

00:26:33.044 --> 00:26:36.861
kind of temperature balance.
Similarly, if you put a

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:39.960
snowball in some hot place,
it'll melt.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.504
Why?
Because the heat from around it

00:26:42.504 --> 00:26:46.191
will go into the snowball.
The temperatures will try and

00:26:46.191 --> 00:26:50.049
equalize each other and
they'll--it'll come out even.

00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:53.287
So, this law of thermodynamics
is why the snowball has no

00:26:53.287 --> 00:26:57.679
chance in hell.
And so, this happens in stars

00:26:57.679 --> 00:27:05.345
too, right?
So, the heat in the center of

00:27:05.345 --> 00:27:10.545
the star flows out.
And when it gets to the

00:27:10.545 --> 00:27:12.818
surface, it's radiated.
At the surface,

00:27:12.818 --> 00:27:16.503
it radiates,
and that's the energy that we

00:27:16.503 --> 00:27:20.322
see coming from the star.
It's this heat that was in the

00:27:20.322 --> 00:27:21.599
center.
It's gotten to the surface.

00:27:21.599 --> 00:27:25.277
It's now radiating away out
into the cold depths of space,

00:27:25.277 --> 00:27:28.313
and that's what we see.
But, that means that the

00:27:28.313 --> 00:27:32.050
temperature in the center of the
star, which is holding the star

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.720
up, decreases,
and then the star wouldn't hold

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:39.042
itself up.
So you require--in order for

00:27:39.042 --> 00:27:46.519
the star to hold itself out--an
energy source at the center of

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:51.369
the star.
And this does two things.

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:57.291
It replaces all that lost heat,
and it preserves the

00:27:57.291 --> 00:28:02.980
equilibrium of the star so it
doesn't collapse.

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.950
Okay, so this is all pretty
abstract.

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:13.633
And it was known that this had
to be true before they figured

00:28:13.633 --> 00:28:17.976
out what the energy source was.
It was known for people just

00:28:17.976 --> 00:28:21.824
sort of thinking in very general
terms about how the Sun could

00:28:21.824 --> 00:28:25.798
exist--understood that there had
to be some kind of large source

00:28:25.798 --> 00:28:28.700
of energy down in the middle of
the star.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.910
And, notice it has to be in the
middle of the star.

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:33.771
It does no good for the energy
to be created all the way

00:28:33.771 --> 00:28:36.269
through the star,
because if it's created all the

00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:38.738
way through the star,
then the temperature is

00:28:38.738 --> 00:28:41.786
distributed throughout the star
and you don't get a situation

00:28:41.786 --> 00:28:44.479
where it's much hotter in the
middle than it is on the

00:28:44.479 --> 00:28:47.176
outside.
So, everybody knew for quite a

00:28:47.176 --> 00:28:51.045
while that there was energy
being created in the center of

00:28:51.045 --> 00:28:53.295
the star.
They just didn't understand how

00:28:53.295 --> 00:28:56.242
that was done.
And then when people invented

00:28:56.242 --> 00:28:59.970
nuclear physics in the 1930s and
'40s and '50s,

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:03.084
it was understood that this
comes from nuclear

00:29:03.084 --> 00:29:06.059
reactions--nuclear fusion,
in particular.

00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:09.975
In the case of the Sun,
it's the fusion of hydrogen,

00:29:09.975 --> 00:29:13.660
atoms together to make helium,
that does this.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.003
And that releases energy in the
same way that a nuclear bomb

00:29:17.003 --> 00:29:17.400
does.

00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:24.890
The problem with this is that
eventually you run out of

00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.690
hydrogen, or whatever your
nuclear fuel is,

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:30.303
because you've got only a
limited amount of it in any one

00:29:30.303 --> 00:29:32.847
star.
So, eventually,

00:29:32.847 --> 00:29:36.840
the nuclear fuel runs out.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:45.044
And then the star has many
adventures before it settles

00:29:45.044 --> 00:29:46.508
down.
And for these,

00:29:46.508 --> 00:29:50.118
I will have to refer you either
to a textbook or to some other

00:29:50.118 --> 00:29:52.611
course,
because I'm not going to take

00:29:52.611 --> 00:29:56.612
you through the whole exciting
life of a star once its nuclear

00:29:56.612 --> 00:29:59.630
fuel is exhausted.
Suffice it to say that you know

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:02.965
in advance what the outcome has
to be, because there's no way it

00:30:02.965 --> 00:30:04.962
can hold itself up,
in the long run,

00:30:04.962 --> 00:30:07.979
because it doesn't have an
energy source down at the center

00:30:07.979 --> 00:30:12.700
of the star.
So, the consequence of this has

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:18.625
to be that the star collapses.
Now, it doesn't necessarily

00:30:18.625 --> 00:30:22.230
collapse all the way down to
being a black hole,

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:27.187
because there are other kinds
of pressure besides the pressure

00:30:27.187 --> 00:30:32.594
exerted by an ideal gas.
So, at very high densities,

00:30:32.594 --> 00:30:36.620
you get other kinds of
pressure.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.781
In particular,
there's something called

00:30:43.781 --> 00:30:46.440
"electron degeneracy pressure."

00:30:50.779 --> 00:30:52.958
This is sometimes called Fermi
pressure, after the guy who

00:30:52.958 --> 00:30:53.570
thought it up.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.903
Degeneracy is another one of
those words that means something

00:30:59.903 --> 00:31:02.242
different to physicists than
they do to ordinary,

00:31:02.242 --> 00:31:05.905
normal people.
I remember the first time I

00:31:05.905 --> 00:31:10.134
taught Astro 110,
right after I came here,

00:31:10.134 --> 00:31:14.376
about fifteen years ago.
I started talking in the middle

00:31:14.376 --> 00:31:16.349
of a class about degenerate
white dwarfs.

00:31:16.349 --> 00:31:20.616
And you could feel this sort of
wave of something between

00:31:20.616 --> 00:31:24.272
confusion and anxiety permeate
through the class,

00:31:24.272 --> 00:31:27.319
and I had no idea what was
going on.

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:29.763
Some teaching assistant had to
pull me aside afterward and

00:31:29.763 --> 00:31:31.950
remind me that these words mean
different things.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:35.820
So, I apologize if this sounds
like a sort of adult version of

00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.941
a Grimm's fairy tale,
you know, with degenerate white

00:31:38.941 --> 00:31:42.104
dwarfs wandering around and
stuff, but such are the words we

00:31:42.104 --> 00:31:45.339
have to work with.
Okay.

00:31:45.339 --> 00:31:47.994
So you have this electron
degeneracy pressure--that's a

00:31:47.994 --> 00:31:51.190
different kind of pressure –
and that can stabilize the star.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:57.285
So it stabilizes a
star--stabilizes the star

00:31:57.285 --> 00:32:02.529
at--around the radius of the
Earth.

00:32:02.529 --> 00:32:06.360
So, that's very high density
material.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.958
We can calculate the density.
You'll remember our equation

00:32:09.958 --> 00:32:13.299
for density: mass over volume.
And so let's see,

00:32:13.299 --> 00:32:16.540
how does this work?
This will be the mass of the

00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.459
Sun, let's say,
divided by the volume of the

00:32:19.459 --> 00:32:23.980
Earth.
That's 4/3πr^(3).

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.549
Radius of the Earth is (7 x
10^(6))^(3).

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:33.859
So, let's see,
(2 x 10^(30)) / 4.

00:32:33.859 --> 00:32:38.720
7^(3)-- 7^(2) = 57,
cubed is 350.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:46.161
Times 10^(18).
That's 6 x 3--yeah,

00:32:46.161 --> 00:32:52.648
okay, we're doing all right.
And let's say that that's 2,000

00:32:52.648 --> 00:32:56.837
x 10^(27) over,
I don't know,

00:32:56.837 --> 00:33:00.890
1,400 x 10^(18).
Let's cancel those.

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:05.710
10^(9) kilograms per meters
squared.

00:33:05.710 --> 00:33:11.460
That's about a million times
denser than water.

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:16.305
Water, you'll remember,
is 10^(3) kilograms per meters

00:33:16.305 --> 00:33:21.011
squared.
And water is defined to have a

00:33:21.011 --> 00:33:26.319
density of 1 gram for a cubic
centimeter.

00:33:26.319 --> 00:33:30.221
So, if you were to pick up one
gram of this white dwarf--one

00:33:30.221 --> 00:33:32.799
cubic centimeter of this white
dwarf,

00:33:32.799 --> 00:33:35.660
it would be a million times
more massive than a gram.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.202
That's about a ton.
So, a thimbleful of this stuff

00:33:39.202 --> 00:33:41.849
weighs about a ton,
very dense.

00:33:41.849 --> 00:33:47.128
And the Sun will end its life
as a white dwarf with this

00:33:47.128 --> 00:33:51.160
electron pressure balancing the
gravity.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.055
These--such stars are called
white dwarfs,

00:33:55.055 --> 00:33:58.380
and there are many of them
known.

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:02.690
White dwarfs--this is the end
point of the Sun.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:09.758
And then, in the 1930s,
what happened to make black

00:34:09.758 --> 00:34:12.923
holes inevitable,
was that one of the great

00:34:12.923 --> 00:34:17.219
theoretical astrophysicists of
the twentieth century,

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.887
a man named Subramanyan
Chandrasekhar,

00:34:19.887 --> 00:34:23.563
discovered that electron
degeneracy pressure doesn't

00:34:23.563 --> 00:34:27.204
always do the job.
So, in the 1930s,

00:34:27.204 --> 00:34:34.819
Chandrasekhar discovers--proves
that if the mass of an object is

00:34:34.819 --> 00:34:40.380
greater than 1.4 times the mass
of the Sun,

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:46.600
electron--this kind of electron
pressure is insufficient.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:53.650
And the star continues to
collapse.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.171
Now, Chandra was a graduate
student in England at the time

00:34:57.171 --> 00:34:59.993
he figured this out,
and he presented this rather

00:34:59.993 --> 00:35:02.972
dramatic result at a big meeting
of the Royal Astronomical

00:35:02.972 --> 00:35:05.568
Society in London.
And then, every graduate

00:35:05.568 --> 00:35:07.940
student's worst nightmare took
place.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:11.736
Chandra's thesis advisor was a
very famous man named Arthur

00:35:11.736 --> 00:35:15.009
Eddington, one of the great
physicists of the early

00:35:15.009 --> 00:35:18.496
twentieth century.
And after Chandra had presented

00:35:18.496 --> 00:35:21.400
his results to all these
assembled scientific

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.193
dignitaries,
Eddington got up and denounced

00:35:24.193 --> 00:35:26.958
his own student,
and said, "This can't possibly

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:29.492
be true."
And Eddington made the famous

00:35:29.492 --> 00:35:33.429
remark, "There ought to be a law
of nature to prevent stars from

00:35:33.429 --> 00:35:35.679
behaving in this foolish
manner."

00:35:35.679 --> 00:35:41.006
And the consequence of that is
that a lot of people didn't

00:35:41.006 --> 00:35:45.148
follow up on Chandra's idea.
Chandra got miffed,

00:35:45.148 --> 00:35:48.753
as you might understand.
He got on the boat to the

00:35:48.753 --> 00:35:51.099
United States.
He spent the rest of his career

00:35:51.099 --> 00:35:53.130
at the University of Chicago.
On the boat,

00:35:53.130 --> 00:35:57.076
he wrote a great textbook still
in use on the structure of

00:35:57.076 --> 00:35:59.422
stars,
in which he laid out in detail

00:35:59.422 --> 00:36:02.466
all of the arguments that the
Chandrasekhar limit must

00:36:02.466 --> 00:36:05.675
actually exist.
And fifty years later he got

00:36:05.675 --> 00:36:09.328
the Nobel Prize for it.
But that--there was this kind

00:36:09.328 --> 00:36:11.611
of time lag there,
and it is, I think,

00:36:11.611 --> 00:36:15.343
important for those of us,
say, on the faculty to recall

00:36:15.343 --> 00:36:19.498
that if Eddington had listened
to his student instead of to his

00:36:19.498 --> 00:36:21.963
intuition,
the study of black holes would

00:36:21.963 --> 00:36:24.620
probably be forty years more
advanced than it is.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:29.899
So, another fable for our times.
Chandra was always very

00:36:29.899 --> 00:36:33.119
gracious about this,
actually.

00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:36.362
He would praise Eddington to
the skies as a wonderful

00:36:36.362 --> 00:36:39.230
advisor, and then with this
little asterisk.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:44.510
So, fable: Chandrasekhar's
limit is the title,

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.673
and the moral here is,
"believe your student,

00:36:49.673 --> 00:36:54.308
not your intuition."
And actually,

00:36:54.308 --> 00:37:02.280
the story of Eddington was
actually kind of interesting.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.935
As Eddington got older,
he became more and more

00:37:04.935 --> 00:37:07.418
convinced that,
you know, he could guess the

00:37:07.418 --> 00:37:09.807
right answer.
And so, it wasn't just the

00:37:09.807 --> 00:37:12.079
Chandrasekhar limit,
it was other things.

00:37:12.079 --> 00:37:14.285
He got a little weird toward
the end of his life,

00:37:14.285 --> 00:37:16.170
and he started believing his
intuition.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.265
Einstein did this too, right?
Einstein famously discovers all

00:37:19.265 --> 00:37:21.858
this great stuff,
and then the second half of his

00:37:21.858 --> 00:37:24.288
life is completely useless,
scientifically,

00:37:24.288 --> 00:37:27.522
because he becomes convinced
that his gut is telling him that

00:37:27.522 --> 00:37:30.247
quantum mechanics is wrong.
This famous remark,

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:33.742
"God does not play dice with
the universe"--but it turns out,

00:37:33.742 --> 00:37:36.588
that isn't true.
And so, there is this

00:37:36.588 --> 00:37:41.719
probabilistic nature of reality
that quantum mechanics shows.

00:37:41.719 --> 00:37:44.949
And so, Einstein spent the
second half of life trying to

00:37:44.949 --> 00:37:47.239
prove that his intuition was
correct,

00:37:47.239 --> 00:37:49.843
that quantum mechanics couldn't
really be true and thus,

00:37:49.843 --> 00:37:52.730
did no physics worth doing for
about thirty or forty years.

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:54.750
So, you have to watch out for
this.

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.906
If you're too smart and start
believing yourself,

00:37:56.906 --> 00:37:59.809
you can get into trouble.
All right.

00:37:59.809 --> 00:38:05.429
Now, having said all that,
Eddington was partly right.

00:38:05.429 --> 00:38:08.541
There is, sort of,
a law of nature that prevents

00:38:08.541 --> 00:38:11.519
stars from behaving in this
foolish manner.

00:38:11.519 --> 00:38:15.162
So, to understand that,
what happens when white

00:38:15.162 --> 00:38:18.409
dwarfs--when the white dwarf
collapses?

00:38:18.409 --> 00:38:22.259
It's got to get rid of its
electrons, because the problem

00:38:22.259 --> 00:38:26.039
is, the way this electron
degeneracy pressure works--you

00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:30.095
can't squeeze electrons any
closer together than they are in

00:38:30.095 --> 00:38:32.435
a white dwarf.
So now, you have to get rid of

00:38:32.435 --> 00:38:33.960
electrons.
And so what do you do?

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.420
You combine the electrons and
the protons and you turn them

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:41.050
into neutrons plus neutrinos.
These are neutrinos.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:44.100
They stream out.
And so, you end up with

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:48.610
something that's made entirely
out of neutrons.

00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:53.330
So, the whole star turns into
neutrons.

00:38:57.519 --> 00:39:02.303
A chemist would think of this
as essentially turning the whole

00:39:02.303 --> 00:39:05.909
star into one atom,
into one atomic nucleus.

00:39:05.909 --> 00:39:10.277
An atomic nucleus with no--an
atom with no protons,

00:39:10.277 --> 00:39:13.510
no electrons,
and 10^(57) neutrons.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:16.081
And you could imagine putting
that somewhere on the Periodic

00:39:16.081 --> 00:39:19.740
Table.
Astronomers call these things

00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.280
neutron stars,
and they exist.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.730
They were discovered in the
1960s.

00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:36.247
And a typical neutron star,
a couple times the mass of the

00:39:36.247 --> 00:39:40.710
Sun has--mass equals 2 times the
mass of the Sun.

00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:45.050
Radius of about 10 kilometers.
And you can work out the

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:49.213
density for that.
Density is a billion times

00:39:49.213 --> 00:39:57.210
greater--I'll leave this as an
exercise--greater than for white

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.564
dwarfs.
So, instead of a cubic

00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:02.563
centimeter of the stuff weighing
a ton, it now weighs a billion

00:40:02.563 --> 00:40:05.324
tons.
And you're having a tough time

00:40:05.324 --> 00:40:09.557
moving it around.
But 10 kilometers – that's

00:40:09.557 --> 00:40:13.869
getting close to the
Schwarzschild radius.

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:16.300
Remember, we calculated the
Schwarzschild radius of the Sun.

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.969
It was about 3 kilometers.
And, in fact,

00:40:18.969 --> 00:40:22.889
if you calculate the
Schwarzschild radius of a star

00:40:22.889 --> 00:40:27.750
in terms of the Schwarzschild
radius of the Sun--let's see,

00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:29.707
you get 2GM /
c^(2),

00:40:29.707 --> 00:40:32.139
where M is the mass of
the star,

00:40:32.139 --> 00:40:38.190
divided by 2G mass of
the Sun, over c^(2).

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.716
So the Gs and the
cs all cancel,

00:40:40.716 --> 00:40:41.818
here.
And you get

00:40:41.818 --> 00:40:45.039
M_star /
M_sun.

00:40:45.039 --> 00:40:51.254
So, if the Chandrasekhar mass
of the Sun is equal to 3

00:40:51.254 --> 00:40:57.529
kilometers, as we calculated,
the Schwarzschild radius of a

00:40:57.529 --> 00:41:03.082
star with--whose mass happens to
equal 3 times the mass of the

00:41:03.082 --> 00:41:05.288
Sun,
is going to be 3 x three

00:41:05.288 --> 00:41:13.897
kilometers, or 10 kilometers.
That's equal to the radius of a

00:41:13.897 --> 00:41:19.657
neutron star.
So, a neutron star with mass

00:41:19.657 --> 00:41:25.762
greater than 3 times the mass of
the Sun has a radius less than

00:41:25.762 --> 00:41:30.510
its Schwarzschild radius.
And that's a black hole.

00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:35.583
Remember?
And the key thing here is that

00:41:35.583 --> 00:41:40.704
there are lots of stars with
mass more than 3 times the mass

00:41:40.704 --> 00:41:42.874
of the Sun.
We don't see them as black

00:41:42.874 --> 00:41:44.929
holes because they're still in
hydrostatic equilibrium.

00:41:44.929 --> 00:41:47.092
But eventually,
they're going to run out of

00:41:47.092 --> 00:41:49.460
nuclear fuel,
and they're going to collapse.

00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:52.156
Now, in fact,
during the course of the star's

00:41:52.156 --> 00:41:55.465
life, one of the things I
glossed over is stars tend to

00:41:55.465 --> 00:41:59.005
lose mass as they live.
And so, they don't end up with

00:41:59.005 --> 00:42:03.914
the same mass they started with.
But stars with initial masses,

00:42:03.914 --> 00:42:09.204
at the beginning of their
lifetime, greater than--I don't

00:42:09.204 --> 00:42:12.270
know,
something like thirty times the

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.774
mass of the Sun,
will end up with masses greater

00:42:15.774 --> 00:42:18.980
than three times to the mass of
the Sun.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:23.380
And then, there's nothing to
stop their collapse.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.635
What happens is,
they turn into neutron stars,

00:42:25.635 --> 00:42:28.191
but they turn into neutron
stars whose Schwarzschild

00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:31.600
radius--whose radii are smaller
than their Schwarzschild radius,

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:37.050
and that is a black hole.
So, they collapse down into

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:40.505
black holes.
And so, you expect a large

00:42:40.505 --> 00:42:44.110
number of black holes to
actually exist.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:48.909
This is what happens to massive
stars at the end of their life.

00:42:48.909 --> 00:43:02.721
And so, we expect there to
be--that there are many black

00:43:02.721 --> 00:43:04.730
holes.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.938
And so, the question we'll be
exploring in the rest of this

00:43:11.938 --> 00:43:15.809
segment of the class is,
how can you find these things?

00:43:15.809 --> 00:43:20.198
What are the properties of
these things from a theoretical

00:43:20.198 --> 00:43:22.865
point of view?
What does Einstein's Theory of

00:43:22.865 --> 00:43:25.880
Relativity suggest that these
things are going to behave like?

00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:28.636
And then, the big question is,
once you've found some,

00:43:28.636 --> 00:43:31.757
and you have a theory for what
they behave like--then you can

00:43:31.757 --> 00:43:34.341
ask the question,
does the actual behavior of

00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:37.380
these objects conform to the
theoretical expectations?

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:41.059
Another way of saying that is,
was Einstein right?

00:43:41.059 --> 00:43:45.252
Is general relativity the
correct theory to describe these

00:43:45.252 --> 00:43:48.302
very exotic objects?
And so, that's what we'll be

00:43:48.302 --> 00:43:51.219
talking about in the rest of
this section of the course.

00:43:51.219 --> 00:43:54.804
Now, let me turn back to the
previous section of the course,

00:43:54.804 --> 00:43:58.449
which was--which culminated
last time in this little test.

00:43:58.449 --> 00:44:01.990
And I think we're ready to hand
these back.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.990
Is that true?

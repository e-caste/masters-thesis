00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.075
Professor David Blight:
Today we're going to take

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:05.940
up a question that has been for
the past,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.358
well, nearly 20 years,
probably the most active--to

00:00:11.358 --> 00:00:17.860
many the most stimulating aspect
of Civil War scholarship.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.900
How did the Civil War affect
civilians?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.090
What were the social impacts of
such a massive experience?

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.558
How could you mobilize
societies on this scale without

00:00:35.558 --> 00:00:40.024
profoundly changing people?
What did it do to gender

00:00:40.024 --> 00:00:42.676
relations?
What did it do to the meaning

00:00:42.676 --> 00:00:45.110
of race?
We've already begun to deal

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.547
with that question in some
depth, how this war would

00:00:48.547 --> 00:00:52.324
transform the Constitution,
transform American political

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:56.147
culture, transform the lives of
African-Americans--and more on

00:00:56.147 --> 00:00:58.022
that in time.
But, of course,

00:00:58.022 --> 00:01:01.219
social history won the
revolution in American history.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.312
Oh, somewhere back in the '70s
and '80s everybody wanted to be

00:01:07.312 --> 00:01:11.135
a social historian.
When I arrived at Amherst

00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:15.206
College circa 1989 to teach
there was something in the--what

00:01:15.206 --> 00:01:17.689
was known as--the Pioneer
Valley,

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.599
the Five College Consortium--a
Social History Working Group.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:28.409
And I remember asking,
can you give a paper if it's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:35.769
not social history?
And the answer was "sure."

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:41.808
Social history won a sort of
methodological struggle over how

00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:45.834
to do history,
what is the meaning of the

00:01:45.834 --> 00:01:48.625
past?
And you all know that by now,

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:51.550
whether you think about it that
much or not.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.110
Social history brought us the
history of women.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.144
It brought us a revolution and
scholarship in the study of

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:02.181
African-Americans.
It brought us a revolution in

00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:04.969
the study of class.
It taught us how to study

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.239
social groups in historical
time.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:12.349
It's taught us how to study
ordinary people.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.399
But--and then I'll get off this
historiographical high

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:22.639
horse--it's remarkable how much
Civil War historians,

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:26.616
focused as they were so much on
an event, focused so much as

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:29.110
they were so often for
generations,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.354
as many put it,
on headquarters,

00:02:31.354 --> 00:02:35.553
the headquarters of generals
and of thousands of dispatches

00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:40.042
they wrote--because those were
the sources--or the headquarters

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:43.567
of the government,
the president,

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:50.078
commander of the armies,
focused so much on an event

00:02:50.078 --> 00:02:55.682
from headquarters.
A social historian came along

00:02:55.682 --> 00:02:57.489
in 1989.
He wrote a, well,

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.401
it was a relatively short
little essay in the Journal

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.576
of American History that
became the title essay of a book

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:05.800
of essays that came out a year
later.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.476
It was by Maris Vinovskis,
a numbers crunching,

00:03:09.476 --> 00:03:14.192
hard-boiled social historian
who used to argue "if you can't

00:03:14.192 --> 00:03:18.528
count it, it ain't history."
He wrote a little essay,

00:03:18.528 --> 00:03:22.530
he said, "have social
historians lost the Civil War?"

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.293
His answer, of course,
was yes, and he showed,

00:03:25.293 --> 00:03:27.995
very carefully,
by looking at few New England

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:30.501
towns,
that old tradition of studying

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.905
in microcosm New England
towns--which Colonial American

00:03:33.905 --> 00:03:37.436
history had been doing for a
generation or two--he showed

00:03:37.436 --> 00:03:41.030
that there are all these towns
all over New England,

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.644
small and relatively large,
that had lost half of their men

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:53.720
between the age of 18 and 45,
in four years of war.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.208
He went to some local records
and he discovered some of those

00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:01.650
towns had lost 60% of their male
population.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.873
He looked a little closer and
he saw that the whole idea of

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.939
occupations in those towns got
completely redefined,

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:15.250
at least during the war years,
because the men were all gone.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.220
He started to count widows and
count orphans.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.930
And, by God,
you could count these things.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.908
You could measure how many
widows were there in

00:04:24.908 --> 00:04:28.534
Newburyport, Massachusetts,
how many widows were there in

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:33.370
Bangor, Maine.
You could count it.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.857
It stimulated a small
revolution in scholarship,

00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:41.199
and it runs unabated as we
speak.

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.355
And in some ways,
the most important kind of

00:04:44.355 --> 00:04:48.654
history done on it is two kinds.
It's the kind of new Women's

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:51.426
History you're reading in Drew
Faust's book,

00:04:51.426 --> 00:04:54.649
Mothers of Invention--a
wonderful title.

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:58.068
I don't know if any of you
remember the old song by that

00:04:58.068 --> 00:05:00.430
title but it's worth thinking
about.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.769
There's an irony in there
somewhere.

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:04.314
At any rate,
you get a book like Drew

00:05:04.314 --> 00:05:06.759
Faust's, which stands on the
shoulders of other books like

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:09.401
it,
but a book that went and read

00:05:09.401 --> 00:05:14.084
thousands of Southern women's
letters and diaries to try to

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:19.009
understand "how did this war
affect Southern white women?"

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.361
And she has many answers to
that, including the somewhat

00:05:23.361 --> 00:05:27.949
bold argument at the end of that
book that it was women,

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:32.017
in part--an argument that has
been tested by other scholars

00:05:32.017 --> 00:05:36.154
and even backed off from a bit
by Drew herself--but she ends

00:05:36.154 --> 00:05:40.082
the book at least with a
suggestion that the sheer weight

00:05:40.082 --> 00:05:43.939
of the burden of the war on
Southern white women and the

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:47.866
thousands upon thousands of
letters in which they express

00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:50.991
that to their mates,
their husbands,

00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:53.646
their brothers,
their sons at the front,

00:05:53.646 --> 00:05:55.279
that it was,
in part,

00:05:55.279 --> 00:06:01.019
Southern white women that made
the South give up the war.

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:05.300
And the other part of that
Social History revolution has

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.503
been of course among military
historians themselves who

00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:13.550
discovered ways--the ways had
always been there,

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.064
and there were pioneering works
on this as early as the 1950s by

00:06:18.064 --> 00:06:22.149
a scholar named Bell Wiley who
wrote two thick volumes,

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:25.473
one in 1954 or '55,
one entitled Billy Yank

00:06:25.473 --> 00:06:28.389
and the other entitled Johnny
Reb.

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.017
And lo and behold what that
was, was the beginning of a

00:06:31.017 --> 00:06:33.110
tradition of studying the common
soldier,

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.906
his experiences,
his terrors,

00:06:35.906 --> 00:06:39.202
his horrors,
his stomach problems,

00:06:39.202 --> 00:06:43.750
his dysentery,
his disease, his death.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.411
And above all,
influenced greatly by the field

00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:54.316
of Psychology and influenced
greatly by the rise of gender

00:06:54.316 --> 00:06:57.720
history,
male military historians went

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.040
to those common soldiers and
began to study their values,

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.298
their ideas,
their sense of manhood,

00:07:05.298 --> 00:07:10.604
their sense of the idea of
courage, what that meant in the

00:07:10.604 --> 00:07:16.189
1860s in a mid-Victorian society
like the United States.

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.741
And when the set of values by
which men, young and old,

00:07:19.741 --> 00:07:23.424
defined themselves as men
collided with modern total war,

00:07:23.424 --> 00:07:27.112
what did it do to them?
And of course 'they',

00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:31.665
being the male military
historians of the 1980s and

00:07:31.665 --> 00:07:36.947
'90s, were themselves greatly
affected by the experience of

00:07:36.947 --> 00:07:41.534
the Vietnam War.
Now, with that little bit in

00:07:41.534 --> 00:07:46.979
mind, let me suggest something
that is timeless about this

00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:50.800
question of the social impact of
war,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.382
and then I'll get on to the
substance of how the war

00:07:54.382 --> 00:08:03.910
affected southern society,
northern society, and the like.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:10.690
These are excerpts from letters
from a soldier in Iraq.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.680
His name is Juan Compos.
They're actually emails.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:20.184
Juan was twenty-seven years old.
He wrote this to his wife on

00:08:20.184 --> 00:08:23.521
December 12,2006.
"Hey beautiful,

00:08:23.521 --> 00:08:28.240
well we were on blackout again.
We lost yet some more soldiers.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:32.710
I can't wait to get out of this
place and return to you where I

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.367
belong.
I don't know how much more of

00:08:35.367 --> 00:08:39.075
this place I can take.
I try to be hard and brave for

00:08:39.075 --> 00:08:42.530
my guys but I don't know how
long I can keep up.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:48.868
You know?
It's like every time we go out,

00:08:48.868 --> 00:08:52.490
any time, a bump or sounds
freak me out.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:58.039
Maybe I'm just stressing.
Oh hopefully it'll get over.

00:08:58.039 --> 00:09:02.942
You know, you never think that
anything is or can happen to

00:09:02.942 --> 00:09:05.706
you.
At first you feel invincible

00:09:05.706 --> 00:09:10.220
and then little by little things
start to wear on you."

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.883
That letter goes on and on,
ends of course with tell his

00:09:15.883 --> 00:09:21.202
eight year old son "hello."
Tuesday, October 3,2006:

00:09:21.202 --> 00:09:24.909
"Mood, gloomy.
The life of an infantryman is

00:09:24.909 --> 00:09:27.130
never safe.
How do I know?

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.864
I live it every day.
I lost a good friend of mine

00:09:30.864 --> 00:09:33.529
just two days ago to an enemy
sniper.

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:37.799
The worst feeling in the world
is having lost one of your own

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:40.289
and not being able to fight
back.

00:09:40.289 --> 00:09:44.269
The more I go on patrol the
more alert I tend to be,

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:47.703
but regardless,
the situation here in Iraq is

00:09:47.703 --> 00:09:52.005
that we are never safe.
No matter the counter-measures

00:09:52.005 --> 00:09:56.398
we take to prevent any attacks,
they seem to seep through the

00:09:56.398 --> 00:09:59.138
cracks.
Every day a soldier is lost or

00:09:59.138 --> 00:10:03.610
wounded by enemy attacks.
I, for one, would like to make

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:07.631
it home to my family one day.
Pray for us,

00:10:07.631 --> 00:10:13.335
keep us in your thoughts,
for an infantryman's life is

00:10:13.335 --> 00:10:16.979
never safe."
December 15,2006:

00:10:16.979 --> 00:10:23.305
"My only goals are to make it
out of this place alive,

00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:30.110
to return to you guys and make
you as happy as I can."

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:39.299
Sergeant Compos was killed in
the spring of 2007 by an IUD.

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:48.049
This is a letter from the front
by Charles Brewster,

00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:53.914
dated May 15,1864.
There's a timelessness to what

00:10:53.914 --> 00:10:58.460
soldiers write from war and
there's a timelessness to its

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.725
social impact.
Brewster, as you may remember

00:11:01.725 --> 00:11:04.065
me telling you,
was that soldier from

00:11:04.065 --> 00:11:06.729
Massachusetts,
lonely and confused,

00:11:06.729 --> 00:11:09.848
feeling worthless,
joined the Union Army,

00:11:09.848 --> 00:11:14.704
the 10^(th) Massachusetts,
in April of 1861 and served out

00:11:14.704 --> 00:11:17.884
the entire war,
and managed to survive,

00:11:17.884 --> 00:11:21.399
and wrote 260 quite incredible
letters.

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:25.323
This is the middle of the
Spotsylvania campaign,

00:11:25.323 --> 00:11:29.831
arguably the worst constant
daily trench warfare of the

00:11:29.831 --> 00:11:32.624
Civil War.
He's the adjutant of his

00:11:32.624 --> 00:11:36.889
regiment and therefore he has to
record all of the casualties,

00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:41.245
just like Sergeant Compos
describing, in his war,

00:11:41.245 --> 00:11:43.060
sort of one a day.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.370
But this was war that was
killing people by the dozens.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:51.080
He sends his latest report.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.199
"Our regiment suffered terribly
in the fight the other day

00:11:58.199 --> 00:12:01.080
losing six officers wounded and
eight men killed,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.218
plus thirty-four wounded that
we know of, besides probably a

00:12:04.218 --> 00:12:06.080
good many that we do not know
of,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.179
and from twelve to twenty taken
prisoners.

00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:12.396
This makes a grand total of
thirteen officers killed and

00:12:12.396 --> 00:12:14.559
wounded and twenty-four men
killed,

00:12:14.559 --> 00:12:19.251
135 wounded and forty-six
missing, making 218 officers and

00:12:19.251 --> 00:12:23.663
men in twelve days.
The regiment is reduced to 150

00:12:23.663 --> 00:12:29.119
muskets and at this rate there
will be none of us left to ever

00:12:29.119 --> 00:12:32.190
see Richmond."
That regiment would,

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.065
by the way, within about a week
and a half of that,

00:12:36.065 --> 00:12:40.870
be mustered out because they
had insufficient men to serve.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.913
But he ends this letter with
what he describes as the most

00:12:44.913 --> 00:12:48.558
terrible sight he ever saw.
"We're encamped on a splendid

00:12:48.558 --> 00:12:51.572
plantation and the corn and the
wheat is growing finely,

00:12:51.572 --> 00:12:53.490
or rather it was before we
came.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:57.478
But I am afraid the crops will
be very small this year down

00:12:57.478 --> 00:13:00.277
here.
We have not seen our wagons

00:13:00.277 --> 00:13:04.740
since we started and I'm getting
sadly dilapidated.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:10.114
My rear is entirely unprotected.
I have worn the seat of my

00:13:10.114 --> 00:13:15.319
pants and drawers entirely off.
The most terrible sight I ever

00:13:15.319 --> 00:13:19.592
saw was the Rebel side of the
breastwork we fought over the

00:13:19.592 --> 00:13:22.405
other day.
There was one point on the

00:13:22.405 --> 00:13:26.688
ridge where the storm of bullets
never ceased for twenty-four

00:13:26.688 --> 00:13:31.256
hours and the dead were piled in
heaps upon heaps and the wounded

00:13:31.256 --> 00:13:34.039
men were intermixed with the
dead,

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:38.610
held fast by their dead
companions who fell upon them,

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.750
continually adding to the
ghastly pile of men.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:47.020
The breastworks were on the
edge of a heavy oak woods and

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.909
large trees, eighteen inches or
more in diameter,

00:13:50.909 --> 00:13:55.188
were worn and cut completely
off by the storm of bullets and

00:13:55.188 --> 00:13:58.090
fell upon the dead and wounded
Rebels.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:02.934
Those that lay upon our side in
the night when the trees fell

00:14:02.934 --> 00:14:07.859
said that their howlings were
awful when these trees came down

00:14:07.859 --> 00:14:11.098
upon them.
When I looked over in the

00:14:11.098 --> 00:14:15.904
morning there was one Rebel,
sat up, praying at the top of

00:14:15.904 --> 00:14:20.289
his lungs, and others were
gibbering in insanity.

00:14:20.289 --> 00:14:24.467
Others were groaning and
whining at the greatest rate,

00:14:24.467 --> 00:14:29.275
while during the whole of it I
did not hear one of our wounded

00:14:29.275 --> 00:14:34.714
men make any fuss,
other than once in awhile one

00:14:34.714 --> 00:14:39.440
would sing out 'oh' when he was
hit.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.488
But it is a terrible,
terrible, terrible"--three

00:14:43.488 --> 00:14:47.710
terribles--"business to make the
best of this."

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:58.809
Oh, it doesn't really matter
what war you're talking about.

00:14:58.809 --> 00:15:04.474
Charlie Brewster's descriptions
could have been along the Somme

00:15:04.474 --> 00:15:07.895
in World War One,
they could've been somewhere in

00:15:07.895 --> 00:15:10.559
the Battle of the Bulge of the
Second World War,

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:14.954
they could've have come from Da
Nang, and they could've come

00:15:14.954 --> 00:15:19.070
from the north of Baghdad,
as it always says,

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:26.460
or near Basra or outside Mosul.
So what is tragedy?

00:15:26.460 --> 00:15:29.750
What is tragedy in relation to
war?

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:35.063
How do we understand tragedy
through this prism of the social

00:15:35.063 --> 00:15:38.195
impact of war?
I think you only ultimately

00:15:38.195 --> 00:15:41.309
really do understand it by
leaving headquarters,

00:15:41.309 --> 00:15:44.779
by leaving the generals'
dispatches, by leaving even

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:48.521
Abraham Lincoln's magnificent
prose and trying to see it

00:15:48.521 --> 00:15:54.460
through ordinary eyes,
ordinary women, ordinary men.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:59.110
Tragedy is one of those words
that we, especially Americans,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:03.114
tend to use haphazardly.
It's a pet peeve of mine,

00:16:03.114 --> 00:16:05.850
but it's probably just my
problem.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:10.682
Every plane crash is a tragedy,
a car accident is a tragedy,

00:16:10.682 --> 00:16:14.039
we stub our toes and we call it
tragic.

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:18.882
A tragedy is something we ought
to see through the Book of Job,

00:16:18.882 --> 00:16:23.100
we ought to see it through
Shakespeare's characters.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:26.273
We ought to see it--we ought to
go back at least as far as

00:16:26.273 --> 00:16:30.417
Euripides and the Trojan women.
What does Hekuba do in the

00:16:30.417 --> 00:16:35.032
Trojan women but sit in a
ghastly scene of an utterly

00:16:35.032 --> 00:16:38.780
destroyed city?
All of her men are dead and she

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.763
sits wailing to the sky,
on a stone, crying,

00:16:41.763 --> 00:16:44.530
"How can this be?"
That's tragedy.

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:53.804
We should see tragedy through
Hekuba, or all those women in

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:57.946
Drew Faust's book.
Tragedy can be raw,

00:16:57.946 --> 00:17:03.378
it can be pointless,
it can be utterly unbearable,

00:17:03.378 --> 00:17:07.480
it can be a dead-end with no
exit.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:14.279
Sometimes it is just seemingly
faded horror.

00:17:14.279 --> 00:17:18.555
But sometimes tragedy,
throughout its literary

00:17:18.555 --> 00:17:23.210
history, and then therefore how
we tend to use it,

00:17:23.210 --> 00:17:26.630
tragedy can also be
affirmative.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:34.253
It can even be cathartic,
and we sometimes can find ways

00:17:34.253 --> 00:17:41.031
to make it redemptive.
It should never be treated with

00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:47.220
triumphalism.
It requires a certain mood.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:54.054
Rebecca Harding Davis,
a wonderful American writer who

00:17:54.054 --> 00:17:59.985
experienced the war,
left us this quite amazing

00:17:59.985 --> 00:18:07.464
little description of what I
would call a simple picture of

00:18:07.464 --> 00:18:12.509
tragedy.
She was in a tiny Pennsylvania

00:18:12.509 --> 00:18:16.935
town, doesn't even name it,
and it's 1864,

00:18:16.935 --> 00:18:23.630
and she describes a scene she
witnessed at a train station.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:28.650
I quote her.
"Nobody was in sight but a

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:35.160
poor, thin country girl in a
faded calico gown and sunbonnet.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.550
She stood alone on the platform
waiting.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:43.107
A child was playing beside her.
When we stopped the men took

00:18:43.107 --> 00:18:47.599
out from a freight car"--Davis
was on the train,

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:53.360
forgive me--"the men took out
from a freight car a rough,

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.270
unplanned pine box and laid it
down,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:04.099
baring their heads for a moment.
Then the train steamed away.

00:19:04.099 --> 00:19:09.262
She sat down on the ground,
put her arms around the box,

00:19:09.262 --> 00:19:14.740
and leaned her head on it.
The child went on playing."

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:25.730
We don't know her name.
We don't even know what town.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:44.856
Between 1862 and 1863 life
insurance policies in America

00:19:44.856 --> 00:19:51.829
doubled, or the purchase of life
insurance policies doubled.

00:19:51.829 --> 00:19:57.726
Between 1861 and 1865 only two
books were published in the

00:19:57.726 --> 00:20:03.001
United States on anything
resembling the idea of the

00:20:03.001 --> 00:20:06.068
afterlife.
During the war,

00:20:06.068 --> 00:20:11.465
as utterly consumed as
Americans became with death,

00:20:11.465 --> 00:20:15.890
they weren't writing yet about
heaven.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:21.871
But between 1865 and 1876 no
less than eighty books were

00:20:21.871 --> 00:20:27.309
published on the idea of
afterlife, of a heaven.

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:32.799
Americans, as never before,
were trying to invent a heaven.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:38.178
And the best selling book in
the United States in 1868--and

00:20:38.178 --> 00:20:43.000
it was for a few years
after--was a book by Elizabeth

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.710
Phelps called The Gates
Ajar.

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.541
It's a bizarre but fascinating
book about what heaven actually

00:20:50.541 --> 00:20:54.247
is and what it looks like and
what you do when you get there

00:20:54.247 --> 00:20:58.141
and the compartments it has and
the rooms it has and who you'll

00:20:58.141 --> 00:21:00.648
see,
especially all those dead

00:21:00.648 --> 00:21:02.799
soldiers.
The Gates Ajar was a

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:04.923
massive bestseller,
rivaled Uncle Tom's

00:21:04.923 --> 00:21:07.100
Cabin, at least for the
first year.

00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:14.090
All right, I'm going to leave
you there for the moment.

00:21:17.549 --> 00:21:19.916
And one should never use The
New York Times,

00:21:19.916 --> 00:21:22.188
a first draft of history,
as a historical source,

00:21:22.188 --> 00:21:25.980
but I just did it.
So anyway.

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:26.680
Gosh.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:36.740
Now, the Civil War as social
history.

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.348
Well, the people who really,
really started this,

00:21:40.348 --> 00:21:44.708
of course, were Charles and
Mary Beard, writing back in the

00:21:44.708 --> 00:21:47.133
1920s.
It was Charles and Mary Beard

00:21:47.133 --> 00:21:50.710
in their economic interpretation
of--or in their famous book,

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.683
their big book,
The Rise of American

00:21:52.683 --> 00:21:54.450
Civilization,
who said this;

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:58.392
and this is the challenge in
some ways to all those who would

00:21:58.392 --> 00:22:02.334
refocus from the event itself
onto the social process or onto

00:22:02.334 --> 00:22:05.160
ordinary people experiencing the
event.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.573
The Civil War,
the Beards wrote,

00:22:07.573 --> 00:22:11.699
I quote, "was a social war,
ending in the unquestioned

00:22:11.699 --> 00:22:15.670
establishment of a new power in
the government,

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.839
making vast changes in the
arrangement of classes,

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:22.009
in the accumulation and
distribution of wealth,

00:22:22.009 --> 00:22:24.809
in the course of industrial
development.

00:22:24.809 --> 00:22:30.396
The war was a social cataclysm
in which the capitalist laborers

00:22:30.396 --> 00:22:35.443
and farmers of the North and
West drove from power in the

00:22:35.443 --> 00:22:41.119
national government the planting
aristocracy of the South."

00:22:41.119 --> 00:22:45.660
Now that's a fairly clear
interpretation,

00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:49.251
or judgment.
The Beards went on then,

00:22:49.251 --> 00:22:53.671
in the next paragraph,
actually, to call it the Second

00:22:53.671 --> 00:22:57.138
American Revolution;
and I quote Beard,

00:22:57.138 --> 00:23:01.699
"in a strict sense," he/they
said, "the First American

00:23:01.699 --> 00:23:05.905
Revolution."
The Beard's revolution in the

00:23:05.905 --> 00:23:10.329
Civil War was a social economic
revolution.

00:23:10.329 --> 00:23:14.780
And they made an elaborate
argument for how this war

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.296
transformed the economy,
transformed the nature of the

00:23:19.296 --> 00:23:23.403
government and transformed
forever the relationship of

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:26.785
labor and capital.
But was the Civil War

00:23:26.785 --> 00:23:31.297
ultimately a victory for big
business over the agrarian

00:23:31.297 --> 00:23:33.691
South?
It's been a question we've

00:23:33.691 --> 00:23:36.279
debated over and over and over
and over.

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:38.866
We stopped debating it for
quite awhile,

00:23:38.866 --> 00:23:41.622
frankly;
that debate seemed like an old

00:23:41.622 --> 00:23:43.799
fossil.
When I was in graduate school,

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:45.960
nobody wanted to be a Beardian
anymore.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.180
We were all going to be
cultural social historians.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:54.119
But it's very interesting how
the debate has come back.

00:23:54.119 --> 00:23:58.619
Was the Civil War largely a
clash of economic forces,

00:23:58.619 --> 00:24:03.119
destined to over--was one
force, either free labor or

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:07.099
slave labor, going to overwhelm
the other?

00:24:07.099 --> 00:24:10.651
The Beards in The Rise of
American Civilization,

00:24:10.651 --> 00:24:13.940
in its 500-odd pages,
almost never mention the word

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:15.903
slavery.
To the Beards,

00:24:15.903 --> 00:24:20.595
economic forces were these
inanimate forces in the world,

00:24:20.595 --> 00:24:23.779
they kind of operated on their
own;

00:24:23.779 --> 00:24:28.210
there wasn't that much human
agency.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:33.014
Did the Civil War explode
industrial growth or did it

00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:36.961
actually slow it?
You can get arguments on both

00:24:36.961 --> 00:24:39.873
sides.
The best research now shows us

00:24:39.873 --> 00:24:44.162
that the war itself was not
necessarily the single most

00:24:44.162 --> 00:24:48.769
important engine of America's
great industrial expansion or

00:24:48.769 --> 00:24:52.980
the birth of the American
Industrial Revolution.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.455
There's plenty of scholarship
now that shows us that that

00:24:56.455 --> 00:24:59.309
revolution is much older than
the Civil War,

00:24:59.309 --> 00:25:03.240
that the real launching pad of
American industrialization,

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.859
or the launching period if you
want,

00:25:05.859 --> 00:25:10.050
to find it you got to go back
at least to the 1830s and

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:17.269
probably the 1820s.
You can begin to measure this.

00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:21.262
GNP in the United States--which
I guess we call GDP now,

00:25:21.262 --> 00:25:24.300
don't we, is that right?
It used to be GN;

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.685
is it GDP now?
Gross domestic product--was

00:25:28.685 --> 00:25:35.195
about 1.62 billion in 1840,
it was about 2.4 billion in

00:25:35.195 --> 00:25:38.506
1850,
and on the eve of the Civil War

00:25:38.506 --> 00:25:41.079
in 1860 it was about 4.1
billion.

00:25:41.079 --> 00:25:48.970
So GDP had more than tripled
from 1840 to 1860.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.342
That shows us that there's an
industrial revolution already

00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:54.894
happening.
There were 9000 railroad miles

00:25:54.894 --> 00:25:58.710
in 1850 in the United States.
There were 21,000 in 1860.

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:05.799
The 1850s is a great launching
decade of industrialization.

00:26:05.799 --> 00:26:08.564
Now I'm going to give you a
counter-argument to that in just

00:26:08.564 --> 00:26:11.682
a minute.
There are two economists named

00:26:11.682 --> 00:26:15.932
Claudia Golden and Frank Lewis
who have estimated,

00:26:15.932 --> 00:26:20.790
estimated the actual price of
the American Civil War;

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.623
they put a price tag on it.
The cost of lives lost,

00:26:24.623 --> 00:26:26.560
and of wounds,
that reduced

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.105
productivity--these are their
variables and their factors--the

00:26:31.105 --> 00:26:35.650
cost of lives lost and wounds
that reduced productivity,

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:40.056
as well as property destroyed,
and factoring in government

00:26:40.056 --> 00:26:44.896
expenditures to fight the war,
which were humongous--and I'll

00:26:44.896 --> 00:26:48.604
state some of them in a
moment--Golden and Lewis

00:26:48.604 --> 00:26:53.496
concluded that the overall cost
of war was about six and a half

00:26:53.496 --> 00:26:59.189
billion dollars to fight it.
In today's dollars that would

00:26:59.189 --> 00:27:03.663
be about 145 to 150 billion
dollars, today,

00:27:03.663 --> 00:27:08.349
to fight the four years of the
Civil War.

00:27:08.349 --> 00:27:14.184
This amount would've allowed
the--this is Golden and Lewis's

00:27:14.184 --> 00:27:18.251
argument by the way;
this is what economists can do

00:27:18.251 --> 00:27:21.341
with history if they so
wish--this amount would've

00:27:21.341 --> 00:27:24.241
allowed the Federal
Government--that 145 to 150

00:27:24.241 --> 00:27:28.151
billion--it would've allowed the
Federal Government to purchase

00:27:28.151 --> 00:27:32.250
and free all four million slaves
in 1860 at market prices,

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.818
give each family 40 acres and a
mule, and still they'd have had

00:27:36.818 --> 00:27:41.313
three and a half billion dollars
left over for reparations for

00:27:41.313 --> 00:27:45.661
former slaves.
That's Golden and Lewis's

00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:49.472
argument.
I notice it didn't get much of

00:27:49.472 --> 00:27:54.343
a rise out of you.
But it's an interesting set of

00:27:54.343 --> 00:27:58.500
numbers.
History, of course, intruded.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:02.458
During the war years,
the war retarded economic

00:28:02.458 --> 00:28:06.329
growth in some sectors but in
the long run,

00:28:06.329 --> 00:28:10.564
especially in northern cities
and towns, and especially with

00:28:10.564 --> 00:28:14.153
the mass mobilization now
stimulated by the Federal

00:28:14.153 --> 00:28:17.670
Government,
the war expanded the economy

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.069
like nothing ever had before,
so fast.

00:28:21.069 --> 00:28:23.299
It just depended on where you
lived.

00:28:23.299 --> 00:28:28.410
But stop for just a moment now
with all these measures or

00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:33.552
numbers in your head,
if you can, and just ask for a

00:28:33.552 --> 00:28:39.334
moment what can social history
measure and what can it not

00:28:39.334 --> 00:28:41.909
measure?
It can measure very important

00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:44.676
things, and I'm going to give
you some more numbers in a

00:28:44.676 --> 00:28:48.407
minute.
Social history can measure

00:28:48.407 --> 00:28:52.167
demographic change.
It can measure death,

00:28:52.167 --> 00:28:55.592
disease and casualty rates.
It can measure industrial

00:28:55.592 --> 00:28:59.202
production.
It can measure loss of civilian

00:28:59.202 --> 00:29:02.539
pursuits.
It can measure the number of

00:29:02.539 --> 00:29:07.656
women who enter the workforce.
It can measure government

00:29:07.656 --> 00:29:10.050
expenditures.
It can measure budgets.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:19.661
It can even measure the basic
social impact on a town,

00:29:19.661 --> 00:29:24.292
a locality, a community.
And we now have a number of

00:29:24.292 --> 00:29:27.327
these wonderful micro histories
of southern towns,

00:29:27.327 --> 00:29:29.371
northern towns,
Midwest and so on,

00:29:29.371 --> 00:29:33.021
during the war.
But how do you measure other

00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:36.593
social factors?
And this is one of those

00:29:36.593 --> 00:29:40.980
questions that makes history
endlessly necessary,

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:45.459
useful, interesting,
and attracts some of us fools

00:29:45.459 --> 00:29:50.280
to live with it forever.
How do you measure despair?

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.867
How do you measure loneliness?
How do you measure the

00:29:53.867 --> 00:29:57.434
dislocation and fear of widows?
How do you measure the

00:29:57.434 --> 00:30:00.650
suffering of soldiers from
wounds and disease?

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:05.390
How do you measure the loss of
a sense of home,

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:11.934
of dislocated worlds?
How do you measure nationalism,

00:30:11.934 --> 00:30:15.972
patriotism?
Sometimes we can find some

00:30:15.972 --> 00:30:19.420
measures of that,
in morale studies.

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:22.968
How do you measure the
psychological damage of combat

00:30:22.968 --> 00:30:25.927
on the human psyche?
How do you measure the

00:30:25.927 --> 00:30:29.240
fracturing of marriages and
relationships by war?

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.980
How do you measure home front
worry?

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:38.604
How do you measure the ways war
tests and changes values,

00:30:38.604 --> 00:30:43.502
sentiments and morality itself?
How do you measure the social

00:30:43.502 --> 00:30:46.650
and moral consequences of
killing people?

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:55.519
How do you measure femininity,
manhood, patriarchy?

00:30:55.519 --> 00:30:59.000
How do you measure what it
meant to become free?

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:08.105
You don't, but you do study it.
Now, let me give you one other

00:31:08.105 --> 00:31:10.440
example, or maybe two.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.652
Social impact.
Let's go to one of those

00:31:17.652 --> 00:31:19.883
Southern women.
She gets some mention in

00:31:19.883 --> 00:31:23.564
Faust's book because she wrote
one of the great diaries and

00:31:23.564 --> 00:31:26.039
later memoirs that she then
revised.

00:31:26.039 --> 00:31:29.292
This is not Mary Chesnut now,
the one so often quoted in the

00:31:29.292 --> 00:31:32.206
Burns' film series.
This woman's name was Kate

00:31:32.206 --> 00:31:34.837
Stone.
She wrote a great--well she

00:31:34.837 --> 00:31:39.631
kept a diary that eventually was
published as a book entitled

00:31:39.631 --> 00:31:43.759
Brokenburn,
which was the name of her

00:31:43.759 --> 00:31:47.579
Louisiana cotton and sugar
plantation.

00:31:47.579 --> 00:31:51.450
It's an amazing book because
you can sort of follow the

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:55.751
impact of this war on her psyche
by following her through the

00:31:55.751 --> 00:31:58.690
years and then after the war as
well.

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.220
I'll pick her up right at the
end.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:08.279
The war's all but over and she
records this in April,

00:32:08.279 --> 00:32:11.037
1865.
She has now moved over to

00:32:11.037 --> 00:32:14.120
Tyler, Texas.
She has refugeed her slaves,

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.036
as the phrase went.
She's abandoned her plantation

00:32:17.036 --> 00:32:19.910
because the Union armies took it
in the Red River Campaign.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:25.054
She's lost half of her slaves.
She's lost two brothers in the

00:32:25.054 --> 00:32:29.248
war and a third one has come
home stone silent,

00:32:29.248 --> 00:32:32.462
he never speaks;
battle fatigue,

00:32:32.462 --> 00:32:37.009
shellshock, post-traumatic
stress, who knows?

00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:38.980
They didn't have a name for it
then.

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:42.910
But he never spoke.
Her silent brother was around.

00:32:42.910 --> 00:32:46.765
Two of them are dead.
"All are fearfully depressed,"

00:32:46.765 --> 00:32:49.309
she writes.
This is April '65.

00:32:49.309 --> 00:32:52.109
"I cannot bear to hear them
talk of defeat.

00:32:52.109 --> 00:32:55.660
It seems a reproach to our
gallant dead."

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:59.160
And then there's some sort of
last gasp bravado,

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.470
and she hoped that,
she said,

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:05.697
"the thousands of grass grown
mounds heaped on mountainside

00:33:05.697 --> 00:33:09.706
and in every valley of our
country would still rally the

00:33:09.706 --> 00:33:15.779
South to be free or die."
What bravado in a diary.

00:33:15.779 --> 00:33:19.566
And then a month later,
mid-May 1865,

00:33:19.566 --> 00:33:24.509
she opened a journal entry with
a definition,

00:33:24.509 --> 00:33:28.541
and it doesn't get any better
than this, of the South's

00:33:28.541 --> 00:33:31.603
immediate fate,
and especially the fate of

00:33:31.603 --> 00:33:35.007
women,
living in this kind of now

00:33:35.007 --> 00:33:39.299
physical hardship and personal
isolation.

00:33:39.299 --> 00:33:43.220
She opened the entry with three
underlined words.

00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:48.372
"Conquered, submission,
subjugation are the words that

00:33:48.372 --> 00:33:52.746
burn into my heart,
and yet I feel that we are

00:33:52.746 --> 00:33:57.509
doomed to know them in all their
bitterness."

00:33:57.509 --> 00:34:02.368
She looked ahead,
she began to reflect about her

00:34:02.368 --> 00:34:07.019
class and her race,
and then she said they,

00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:11.264
the white plantar class of the
South, would now become what she

00:34:11.264 --> 00:34:13.327
called slaves.
Quote, "Yes,

00:34:13.327 --> 00:34:16.070
slaves of the Yankee
government."

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:24.116
She feared the quite specific
what she called unendurable fate

00:34:24.116 --> 00:34:29.843
of blacks ruling over her.
"Submission to the Union," she

00:34:29.843 --> 00:34:33.480
went on, "how we hate that word.
Confiscation,

00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:38.218
Negro equality,
or a bloody unequal struggle,

00:34:38.218 --> 00:34:43.671
lest we know not how long."
And then in July of '65,

00:34:43.671 --> 00:34:48.948
rocking a baby in a chair in
her arms, and singing all the

00:34:48.948 --> 00:34:53.768
songs she could remember,
she found she said,

00:34:53.768 --> 00:34:57.639
quote, "The war songs sicken
me.

00:34:57.639 --> 00:34:59.840
The sound is like touching a
new wound.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.200
I cannot bear to think of it
all.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:10.332
I forget whenever I can."
Well it's fascinating to follow

00:35:10.332 --> 00:35:13.210
Kate Stone through time,
though.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:18.279
She did all right.
There weren't many men around

00:35:18.279 --> 00:35:22.012
but she finally met one.
There's an incredible entry

00:35:22.012 --> 00:35:25.439
where she says she started going
to social events and at one of

00:35:25.439 --> 00:35:28.700
them people were dancing and she
couldn't bear to dance,

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:32.420
it just didn't seem right.
But she finally did.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:37.455
She met a surviving Confederate
officer, married him in 1869,

00:35:37.455 --> 00:35:40.111
lived out a life,
had four kids,

00:35:40.111 --> 00:35:44.280
and became the local head of
the United Daughters of the

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.010
Confederacy in her town in
Texas,

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.150
and lived until 1907.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:59.813
Kate Stone did better than most.
But Southern society went to

00:35:59.813 --> 00:36:03.750
war and paid an enormous price,
of course.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:09.651
Civilians.
Civilians were ultimately,

00:36:09.651 --> 00:36:12.519
in some ways,
the strength behind the armies.

00:36:12.519 --> 00:36:14.640
This war was,
to some extent,

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:18.730
lost on the home front,
for the South in particular.

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.159
Having said that,
you can say on the other side

00:36:21.159 --> 00:36:24.170
in some ways it was won on the
home front in the North,

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:27.519
because of industrial
production, because of sheer

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:31.543
numbers and resources.
But it's worth remembering here

00:36:31.543 --> 00:36:35.694
that the Civil War happened to
Southerners more than it

00:36:35.694 --> 00:36:39.922
happened to Northerners.
Only a small portion of this

00:36:39.922 --> 00:36:43.150
war was actually fought on
northern soil.

00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:47.287
The Confederacy failed
ultimately to solve the problems

00:36:47.287 --> 00:36:50.280
of the home front.
Just think of a list.

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:54.367
And this is not to condemn
them, this was their challenge,

00:36:54.367 --> 00:36:58.312
this is the risk they took,
this is what they risked was

00:36:58.312 --> 00:37:01.595
secession in 1861.
The problems of the home front

00:37:01.595 --> 00:37:05.119
they could not ultimately solve
in the midst of this massive,

00:37:05.119 --> 00:37:10.927
enveloping thousand mile front
war, surrounded by a naval

00:37:10.927 --> 00:37:15.659
blockade: money supply;
transportation;

00:37:15.659 --> 00:37:19.300
agriculture,
agricultural production;

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:24.981
developing small industry;
creating a national bureaucracy

00:37:24.981 --> 00:37:29.040
that could be efficient;
maddening shortages of

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.635
foodstuffs, clothing and about
everything else it takes to keep

00:37:33.635 --> 00:37:37.430
armies in the field;
class frictions;

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:42.110
social disintegration;
and last but not least slavery,

00:37:42.110 --> 00:37:45.549
what to do about slavery,
particularly once it comes

00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:49.123
under pressure in 1862 and then
after the Emancipation

00:37:49.123 --> 00:37:53.169
Proclamation which announces the
purpose of the war now is to

00:37:53.169 --> 00:37:56.369
destroy slavery.
What does the Confederacy do?

00:37:56.369 --> 00:38:01.448
We will come back to that,
directly, in terms of the

00:38:01.448 --> 00:38:07.523
Confederate Government's policy
on a kind of emancipation late

00:38:07.523 --> 00:38:12.724
in the war, in '64 and '65.
The South did undergo some

00:38:12.724 --> 00:38:17.360
rapid economic expansion,
remarkable economic expansion.

00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:19.547
In fact, if you read the
sections on this in Jim

00:38:19.547 --> 00:38:22.199
McPherson's Battle Cry of
Freedom as background,

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:26.187
he has some glowing things to
say about just how effective the

00:38:26.187 --> 00:38:29.000
South was in producing cannon,
for example,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.400
at the Tredegar Iron Works in
Richmond.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:36.254
They had 3000 slaves working in
the largest industrial plant

00:38:36.254 --> 00:38:40.368
anywhere in the southern states
by 1863, producing,

00:38:40.368 --> 00:38:43.329
by and large,
their own weapons.

00:38:43.329 --> 00:38:48.728
The naval blockade of the Union
Navy was not very effective at

00:38:48.728 --> 00:38:54.038
first, but it was ultimately
crippling, by the latter part of

00:38:54.038 --> 00:38:57.253
the war.
The estimate is that about five

00:38:57.253 --> 00:39:00.796
out of six blockade runners,
these ships running the

00:39:00.796 --> 00:39:05.612
blockade,
got through between 1861 and

00:39:05.612 --> 00:39:14.287
'62, but by 1864 and '65 only
about one of every two attempted

00:39:14.287 --> 00:39:19.550
blockade runners ever got
through.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:23.019
There was widespread
devastation of staple crop

00:39:23.019 --> 00:39:27.619
agriculture in those parts of
the South where the Union armies

00:39:27.619 --> 00:39:30.473
moved in.
Charlie Brewster just described

00:39:30.473 --> 00:39:32.769
those cornfields of Central
Virginia.

00:39:32.769 --> 00:39:37.401
A Union Army near Southern
crops meant the crops were gone

00:39:37.401 --> 00:39:41.820
in twenty-four hours.
In one of the world's greatest

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:46.155
agricultural economies,
people began to go hungry by

00:39:46.155 --> 00:39:49.739
late '63 and into '64,
bringing about major bread

00:39:49.739 --> 00:39:53.050
riots in cities like Richmond,
Charleston, South Carolina,

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:57.929
and other places.
With more than a half a million

00:39:57.929 --> 00:40:01.659
white men leaving agriculture
across the South,

00:40:01.659 --> 00:40:05.333
it seriously reduced
productivity,

00:40:05.333 --> 00:40:11.900
and then as slavery began to
dissolve, slowly but surely,

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:18.150
this of course disrupted
production, at least in about a

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:22.809
third of the South's
agricultural land.

00:40:22.809 --> 00:40:26.467
The occupation of Louisiana,
for example,

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:29.760
early in the war,
as early as '62,

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:34.158
brought the sugar industry to
the edge of extinction,

00:40:34.158 --> 00:40:39.318
and by the war's end only about
fifteen percent of Louisiana's

00:40:39.318 --> 00:40:43.210
1,300 sugar estates were
operating at all.

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:47.453
The great sugar plantations of
Louisiana were in almost utter

00:40:47.453 --> 00:40:51.484
ruin by the end of the war,
especially after the Red River

00:40:51.484 --> 00:40:54.662
Campaign of 1864.
Tobacco was in shambles as the

00:40:54.662 --> 00:40:57.539
Union armies moved through
Kentucky and Tennessee,

00:40:57.539 --> 00:41:01.734
quite early in the war,
and rice along the coast of

00:41:01.734 --> 00:41:07.103
South Carolina was devastated by
Union occupation as early as '62

00:41:07.103 --> 00:41:10.313
and '63.
And then there was the South's

00:41:10.313 --> 00:41:14.572
decision, Jefferson Davis's
decision, to engage in a cotton

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:17.247
embargo;
that is, they took cotton off

00:41:17.247 --> 00:41:21.048
the world market--and we'll say
more about this when we deal

00:41:21.048 --> 00:41:24.977
with questions of Confederate
defeat in terms of their foreign

00:41:24.977 --> 00:41:28.161
policy.
But the policy by 1863 of the

00:41:28.161 --> 00:41:32.652
Confederate Government was to
take cotton off the world

00:41:32.652 --> 00:41:37.424
market--trying to pull an OPEC,
trying to do with cotton what

00:41:37.424 --> 00:41:41.112
the OPEC countries in our
lifetime have tried to do with

00:41:41.112 --> 00:41:44.568
oil--pull it back,
make the world demand it,

00:41:44.568 --> 00:41:48.420
and maybe make the Brits come
in on your side.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:53.411
It totally backfired and it was
a total economic disaster for

00:41:53.411 --> 00:41:57.060
the South.
The production of cotton in the

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:02.190
Confederate states went from
about five million bales in 1860

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.610
to about one-quarter million in
1865.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.099
Now, Confederate fiscal policy
was also a disaster.

00:42:13.099 --> 00:42:18.260
Not until 1863 did the Richmond
government enact any kind of

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:22.858
comprehensive tax law.
Taxing was not very consistent,

00:42:22.858 --> 00:42:26.968
from the federal level,
with the way the Confederacy

00:42:26.968 --> 00:42:30.876
was itself born.
Even then when they tried to

00:42:30.876 --> 00:42:35.883
pass a comprehensive tax law,
the Confederacy derived in the

00:42:35.883 --> 00:42:40.551
end only about seven percent of
its revenues from actual

00:42:40.551 --> 00:42:43.449
taxation.
The rest came from borrowing

00:42:43.449 --> 00:42:45.402
money from abroad,
sale of bonds,

00:42:45.402 --> 00:42:48.760
which was about twenty-five
percent of their budget,

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.188
impressment of provisions from
Southerners themselves,

00:42:52.188 --> 00:42:57.077
about seventeen percent,
and in the end about fifty

00:42:57.077 --> 00:43:03.984
percent of all money in the
Confederacy and its foyers of

00:43:03.984 --> 00:43:11.016
existence was printed paper
money which became inflated at

00:43:11.016 --> 00:43:14.840
ridiculous rates,
rapidly.

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.568
Now, so much more could be said
here, especially about this

00:43:19.568 --> 00:43:24.134
dissolving institution of
slavery and how it affected the

00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:26.993
South.
But let me spend the last five

00:43:26.993 --> 00:43:30.126
minutes on the North,
which is a very different

00:43:30.126 --> 00:43:32.480
story.
It's a more successful story,

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.599
it's a more progressive story
in the literal sense,

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:39.256
and it is rooted in a
particular kind of political

00:43:39.256 --> 00:43:43.360
vision that that Republican
Party brought to the Federal

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.339
Government.
Before the Civil War,

00:43:46.339 --> 00:43:51.119
the Federal Government did
little more than deliver the

00:43:51.119 --> 00:43:55.280
mail, by and large--that's about
all it did.

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.090
It collected modest tariffs and
it conducted foreign policy;

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:04.217
but by the surrender at
Appomattox, a great deal had

00:44:04.217 --> 00:44:08.368
changed in four years.
Thousands were poised to spread

00:44:08.368 --> 00:44:12.429
across the continent with the
Transcontinental Railroad.

00:44:12.429 --> 00:44:17.611
Businesses had begun to operate
on a national scale with massive

00:44:17.611 --> 00:44:21.969
new marketing plans and
full-time marketing people.

00:44:21.969 --> 00:44:27.110
Higher tariffs would bolster
domestic manufacturing.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:31.782
Individuals experienced the
nation state and gave it their

00:44:31.782 --> 00:44:36.846
allegiance as never before.
An array of new national taxes

00:44:36.846 --> 00:44:40.730
were passed.
The currency was nationalized.

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:44.653
The Federal Government
distributed public lands,

00:44:44.653 --> 00:44:49.161
chartered corporations,
and would enforce black freedom

00:44:49.161 --> 00:44:52.250
with state or national
authority;

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:57.578
and States' Rights,
at least for the time being,

00:44:57.578 --> 00:45:02.679
was dealt nearly a death blow,
temporarily.

00:45:02.679 --> 00:45:06.914
War enabled the Republicans to
pass sweeping visionary

00:45:06.914 --> 00:45:10.349
legislation borne of a certain
worldview,

00:45:10.349 --> 00:45:15.024
and that worldview basically is
captured in what the economists

00:45:15.024 --> 00:45:17.972
of the time,
political economists of the

00:45:17.972 --> 00:45:21.758
time, like Matthew Carey and
others, called "harmony of

00:45:21.758 --> 00:45:24.694
interest."
This is the idea that in a

00:45:24.694 --> 00:45:29.053
capitalist economy you could
bring labor and capital into

00:45:29.053 --> 00:45:33.802
harmony if you kept labor free
and the economy free all at the

00:45:33.802 --> 00:45:36.722
same time.
It was the belief that labor

00:45:36.722 --> 00:45:38.600
and capital could be friends.

00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:44.885
It also depended on an activist
interventionist federal

00:45:44.885 --> 00:45:48.449
government, and that is exactly
what the Republicans created,

00:45:48.449 --> 00:45:51.701
in part out of necessity of the
war and in part out of the fact

00:45:51.701 --> 00:45:53.590
that they actually believed in
it.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:57.778
And it's going to bring about a
great deal of constitutional

00:45:57.778 --> 00:46:00.760
innovation and economic
experimentation.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:07.359
Here's what they did.
In finance, in agriculture,

00:46:07.359 --> 00:46:10.933
in taxes, in building
railroads, and in

00:46:10.933 --> 00:46:16.012
emancipation--at least those
five major categories--the

00:46:16.012 --> 00:46:20.997
Republican Party transformed the
United States Federal

00:46:20.997 --> 00:46:25.178
Government.
They began by first selling war

00:46:25.178 --> 00:46:28.435
bonds.
The Treasury needed money to

00:46:28.435 --> 00:46:32.663
fight the war.
The cost of the American Civil

00:46:32.663 --> 00:46:36.931
War to fight it,
just for the Union Government,

00:46:36.931 --> 00:46:42.033
by 1863 was approximately
two-and-a-half million dollars

00:46:42.033 --> 00:46:46.609
per day.
That's more than the Federal

00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:53.710
Government had spent in some
decades before the Civil War.

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:57.710
Now that's a financial
revolution.

00:46:57.710 --> 00:47:00.778
How are you going to do it?
How are you going to produce

00:47:00.778 --> 00:47:04.063
all this money?
They began selling bonds to

00:47:04.063 --> 00:47:08.056
banks and financiers.
In 1862, about 500 million

00:47:08.056 --> 00:47:12.412
dollars in bonds were sold at
six percent, payable in five

00:47:12.412 --> 00:47:17.360
years.
Buy a bond, support the war.

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.685
The government then chose,
hired, invited,

00:47:21.685 --> 00:47:27.065
from the private sector,
the Philadelphia banker Jay

00:47:27.065 --> 00:47:31.011
Cooke,
enlisted him to lead this

00:47:31.011 --> 00:47:36.909
federal bonds financing program,
and he did lead it,

00:47:36.909 --> 00:47:40.325
aggressively.
The whole idea here was

00:47:40.325 --> 00:47:43.660
economic nationalism,
to invest the citizen in the

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:46.860
fate of the Union by making them
pay for it.

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:51.685
And it was in 1862 that the
Federal Government for the first

00:47:51.685 --> 00:47:54.630
time created the Greenback
Dollar,

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:58.540
the paper dollar,
which actually revolutionalized

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:02.157
American currency.
Financial markets went up and

00:48:02.157 --> 00:48:05.172
down during the war,
depending on battlefield

00:48:05.172 --> 00:48:07.733
success or failure.
But by 1863,

00:48:07.733 --> 00:48:12.561
they were financing a war,
companies were making profits

00:48:12.561 --> 00:48:16.950
and the Federal Government could
pay its bills.

00:48:16.950 --> 00:48:21.294
It worked.
The total national debt of an

00:48:21.294 --> 00:48:27.018
annual two-and-a-half billion
was absorbed by the general

00:48:27.018 --> 00:48:31.082
population,
and it was celebrated as what

00:48:31.082 --> 00:48:35.440
the Republican Party called a
people's triumph.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:43.809
Now, I'm running into that wall
of time, God help me.

00:48:43.809 --> 00:48:46.570
Let me leave you here,
with this.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:50.077
Now, the North has enormous
advantages, of course,

00:48:50.077 --> 00:48:54.300
in resources and population and
industry and transportation,

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.467
and on and on and on.
And it had those New York

00:48:58.467 --> 00:49:03.317
bankers, once they could
convince them to stop being

00:49:03.317 --> 00:49:08.166
anti-union and pro-union.
But what came out of this was a

00:49:08.166 --> 00:49:12.680
revolutionary set of legislation
that only wartime could probably

00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:16.416
have produced;
the Homestead Act in the West,

00:49:16.416 --> 00:49:21.150
the Transcontinental Railroad,
the Morrill Act of 1862,

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:23.714
which was the Land Grant
College Act, which created

00:49:23.714 --> 00:49:25.920
agricultural colleges across the
country,

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:29.964
by federal money.
In fact last week I gave a

00:49:29.964 --> 00:49:33.574
lecture at my alma mater--at
Michigan State--and just outside

00:49:33.574 --> 00:49:36.583
the lecture hall where I
lectured was a copy of the

00:49:36.583 --> 00:49:38.869
original handwritten Morrill
Act.

00:49:38.869 --> 00:49:42.135
I know you don't care but I did
[laughter]

00:49:42.135 --> 00:49:46.994
because Michigan Agricultural
College was the first land grant

00:49:46.994 --> 00:49:49.262
college,
and they always reminded us of

00:49:49.262 --> 00:49:51.580
that every time--every year at
Freshman orientation.

00:49:55.269 --> 00:49:59.158
And really, frankly to
understand--and I'll leave you

00:49:59.158 --> 00:50:02.000
here--to understand how
Northerners,

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.965
the Republican Party,
Lincoln himself and at least

00:50:04.965 --> 00:50:07.931
the majority of those Union
troops came to support

00:50:07.931 --> 00:50:10.728
emancipation,
the freeing of black people,

00:50:10.728 --> 00:50:13.633
by federal authority,
you need to see it in the

00:50:13.633 --> 00:50:17.106
context of all else that this
Republican Party was doing

00:50:17.106 --> 00:50:22.697
through the Federal Government.
They were using government now

00:50:22.697 --> 00:50:29.110
as the engine of great social
experimentation and change;

00:50:29.110 --> 00:50:34.907
granted, so much of it out of
necessity, some of it out of

00:50:34.907 --> 00:50:37.936
will.
I'm going to return to this

00:50:37.936 --> 00:50:43.083
story a little bit on Thursday
as we move toward the question

00:50:43.083 --> 00:50:45.216
of why the North wins this war.

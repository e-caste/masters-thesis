00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.833
(somber music)

00:00:11.748 --> 00:00:15.360
- All right, we're
getting close to the end.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.590
There's this lecture,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.515
which is gonna be about culture
very broadly understood.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:21.420
And then the next lecture,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.040
which is gonna be a kind of review

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.250
of the ideas of empire and Europe.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.240
You can think of both of these
lectures as helping you think

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.090
through some of the
main issues of the class

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.510
as you prepare for the exam.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.130
'Cause I understand that as Yale students,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.290
you would prefer actually
not to be in class,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.930
but to be studying for the
exam, and I'm here to tell you,

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.570
you can do both at the same time, right?

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.510
Especially the essay questions
in the exam give you a lot

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.420
of room to think through
and make arguments, right?

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.700
Think through and make arguments.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.130
And so in these last couple of lectures,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.950
we'll mostly be doing interpretation.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.562
So this lecture is about culture.

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:04.710
I'm not gonna try to
define what a culture is.

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.500
We've got the whole anthropology
department for that,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.000
but what I have in mind here
is the very broad notion of,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.210
let's say, a set of self,

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.750
a set of mutually reinforcing notions

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.210
of what a people might be.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.730
So by Ukrainian culture here,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.640
I'm not gonna have time to get into,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.810
with some exceptions,

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.080
the details of Ukrainian
literature and Ukrainian poetry.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.730
What I'm mainly concerned
with is the notion of people.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.370
So I'm going all the way
back, if you remember,

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.780
all the way back to September

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.310
in the first couple of lectures

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.316
when I tried to specify
that the modern legal notion

00:01:45.316 --> 00:01:49.650
of genocide rests on the
equally modern notion

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.320
of a people or a nation,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.050
and that these two things are in a kind

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.460
of uncomfortable relationship,
one with the other.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.460
And as we complete this
course during a war,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.770
which certainly has
genocidal aspects to it,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.740
it's worth thinking
about that relationship.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.670
So the Genocide Convention in 1948 assumes

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.820
that there is such a
thing as a people, right?

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.620
It assumes that there is a society

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.277
which has a top and a
bottom, which has some way,

00:02:22.277 --> 00:02:24.630
which has some kind of a border

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.660
where people are in or people are out.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.620
So the convention
acknowledges of people in law

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.401
by presuming that they exist.

00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:36.420
You can think of the act of genocide

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.260
as a different kind of
acknowledgement, right?

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.310
You don't destroy something
if it doesn't exist.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.160
You don't seek to destroy
something if it doesn't exist.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.030
But the slightly tricky part
about this is that very often,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.940
the act of destroying to people begins

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.940
with the explicit verbal
negation of its existence, right?

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.472
And so, one of the larger
points I want to try to make

00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:02.280
in this lecture, maybe the large point,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.780
is that Ukrainian culture,
the notion of what Ukraine is,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.760
where it begins and where it stops,

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.300
can't really be done outside
of this larger notion

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.230
of an encounter.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.570
It can't really be done
outside of the notion

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.760
of an encounter with the Russian Empire,

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.153
with the Soviet Union
and contemporary Russia.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.230
Now, as I try to make this argument,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.270
I wanna be clear about
something very specific

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.530
about this encounter,

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.210
something which makes it
a little bit different

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.120
from the other encounters we've
talked about in this class,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.400
which is that this is an encounter

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.310
which denies that it is taking place.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.870
Okay.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.270
This is, like, I'm sure you've
all had moments like that

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.740
in your lives, right?

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.915
Perhaps on a Saturday night,

00:03:44.915 --> 00:03:48.990
encounters where, okay,
that was like a really low,

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.605
going really low, really fast,

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:51.438
(students laughing)

00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:53.643
really early on a really important point.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.760
All right.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.900
But there's a certain
strangeness to an encounter,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.890
or there's this, let me put this,

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.401
there's a specific
character to an encounter

00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:06.720
where one side denies

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.670
then an encounter is
actually taking place.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.297
A third party looking in will say,

00:04:10.297 --> 00:04:12.090
"Well, yes, the encounter is happening,"

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.132
but there's nevertheless
something specific about this.

00:04:14.132 --> 00:04:15.728
So as a way to start,

00:04:15.728 --> 00:04:18.960
I want you to just remember that moment

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.900
in the third quarter of the 19th century

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.900
in the Russian Empire where the existence

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.960
of the Ukrainian language is being denied.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.850
It's a very specific thing to do, right?

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.220
To go out of your way
to deny something exists

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.274
is a very specific form of action.

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:39.390
The Valuev decree of 1863
includes the famous passage

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.200
that I'm quoting now, "The
Ukrainian language never existed,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.550
does not exist, and shall
never exist," right?

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.103
So, or as we say, in Ukrainian,

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:55.125
Української мови ніколи не було, нема, не буде

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.300
Right?

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.703
So I don't know. That was kind of a joke.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.660
But there's a very specific,

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.790
there's a very specific
thing going on here

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.680
when an encounter is being denied, right?

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.600
So if it never existed, why
would you refer to it, right?

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.250
If it doesn't exist now,
why are you banning it?

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.800
But maybe the most
interesting thing is the claim

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.370
that it never will exist.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.530
It never will exist.

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.310
There's this very specific
kind of omniscience going on

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.610
when I make the claim that
something will not happen, right?

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.970
I'm denying the basic unpredictability,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.180
or at least, the contingency of everything

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.830
which is going to happen
after I issue this decree.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.663
In other words,

00:05:43.663 --> 00:05:48.650
this decree is doing a
very specific kind of work.

00:05:50.846 --> 00:05:54.390
The relationship between the
emerging Russian imperial

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.540
culture and the Ukrainian culture,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.011
which exists at the time, is
taking on a very specific form.

00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:06.630
Because of course, it's not
as logically contradictory

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.790
or silly as maybe I'm suggesting,

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:10.260
the idea that the Ukrainian culture

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.990
or language doesn't exist means

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:17.280
that it's existence can only be described

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.680
as part of Russian culture, right?

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.851
So it's not that there are no,

00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:23.100
it's not that there's nothing there,

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.176
it's rather that it can only
be described as existing

00:06:27.176 --> 00:06:30.030
as part of something else, right?

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:34.200
And so when I say that you don't exist,

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.183
what I'm really doing is that I'm saying

00:06:36.183 --> 00:06:38.330
that I do exist, right?

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.500
So there's a fancy term for this,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.523
which is like Constitutive Other,

00:06:42.523 --> 00:06:44.040
which you're welcome to note down

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.180
and use to impress your friends.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:49.740
But the idea that you
don't exist is how I show

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:51.000
that I do exist.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.030
What you are doing has
no character of its own.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.134
It is a version of what I am doing, right?

00:06:58.134 --> 00:07:01.380
And so there's a very specific
thing which is going on here,

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.790
whereby Russian culture as it emerges,

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.960
is being defined not exactly
against Ukrainian culture,

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.280
but somehow riding along on
top of Ukrainian culture.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.820
Anything that seems to be
Ukrainian is actually Russian,

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.110
and anyone who denies this
is moved out of history.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.640
So this is where the categorical part

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.640
of never will exists comes in.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:31.640
So this class has been
all about encounters,

00:07:31.653 --> 00:07:34.770
a basic argument about the
nation in this class has been

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.320
that no nation comes from nowhere, right?

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.960
That's why all the founding
stories are so implausible,

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.180
like the one with the lady and the snake,

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.410
and the one with the guy.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.200
The founding stories are all
really implausible, right?

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.810
They're fun, they're silly,
they don't make any sense.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:51.030
All the stories of ethnogenesis,

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:52.596
including the ones involving the aliens,

00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:55.044
they're all implausible, right?

00:07:55.044 --> 00:07:57.480
There's always some encounter.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.890
And the whole argument of this class

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:00.960
about how something specific
emerged on the terrain

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.660
that's now Ukraine involves,

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:08.660
it involves the Khazars and
the Vikings and the Byzantines

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.910
and the Slavs and the
Lithuanians and the Poles.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.640
And of course, it also very
much involves the Russians

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.560
and the Soviet Union.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.050
But there's something
very specific going on

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.330
from the 19th to 21st centuries

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:26.330
where this encounter has an
ideological quality to it

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.670
that the others don't.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.170
Or in the case of the Polish one,

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:35.310
I would say, no longer
have, no longer has,

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:36.960
but in Russia, it clearly does.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.520
So in order to get ourselves to see this

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.177
and maybe get ourselves out of it,

00:08:43.177 --> 00:08:47.070
we have to kind of look
at some trajectories

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:50.340
in the Russian encounter with Ukraine,

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.300
not from the point of view

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.240
of how a Russian national
ideology would see them,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.500
but just to note what this
encounter looks like, right?

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.713
So this very special thing,

00:09:00.713 --> 00:09:03.113
this is the overall special thing.

00:09:03.113 --> 00:09:08.113
There have been lots of
European empires, right?

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.643
But they all have the feature,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.250
and write this down 'cause it's important,

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.480
of starting in Europe except for one.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.960
You see, what's very different
about the Russian Empire

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.960
is that it becomes an empire
by going into Europe, right?

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.673
By going into Europe.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.260
The Russian Empire becomes
the Russian Empire in 1721,

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.370
having moved from Asia into Europe

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:42.840
as a result of the
cataclysm of 1648 onwards.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.860
Remember that,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.200
and then there was that whole
lecture about the 18th century

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.390
and the collapse of Poland-Lithuania,

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.130
the collapse of the Cossack states,

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:52.500
the collapse of the Crimean Tatar state,

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.140
all those things happening
in the 18th century,

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.210
leaving Russia in Europe.

00:09:57.210 --> 00:10:00.750
But it's not a European empire
that went outwards, right?

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.510
It is a state which was
centered at the edge of Europe

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.610
in this relatively new city called Moscow,

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.710
which first went south and east,

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.460
and then its final stage of
development went into Europe.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.880
And the ambivalence of
the relationship with Kyiv

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.140
is built into that.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.362
Because on the one hand, on the one hand,

00:10:19.362 --> 00:10:23.237
you become European by
claiming Kyiv, right?

00:10:23.237 --> 00:10:26.010
'Cause Kyiv has all those European things

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.843
that you might want.

00:10:26.843 --> 00:10:31.530
It has the old baptism, it
has North European history,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:33.931
it has the Renaissance,
it has the Baroque,

00:10:33.931 --> 00:10:36.630
it has all the European references.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.160
It's just older than you are.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.520
And by a lot, I mean by
five centuries, right?

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.370
Kyiv is four or five
centuries old than Moscow.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:48.090
It is a millennium older
than St. Petersburg, right?

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.380
That's a lot.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.380
So the ambiguity is you become
European by going to Kyiv.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.200
But since you are the empire,

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.200
you can't acknowledge that the
periphery is better than you.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.240
So this tension is built in
from the very, very beginning.

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.720
On the one hand, we are
European because Kyiv,

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.890
but on the other hand,

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:14.010
the people who are around
Kyiv have to be the periphery

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:15.510
and are therefore inferior.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:19.140
That tension is built in from the moment

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.940
that Kyiv, Chernihiv,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:23.220
these places come into the Russian Empire,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.123
and it's still very much
present today, right?

00:11:28.593 --> 00:11:33.210
So the Russian Empire vis-a-vis Ukraine

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:35.790
is simultaneously inferior and superior

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.530
at the same time, right?

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.690
It's superior because
it's big and powerful

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.260
and it's the empire,
but it's also inferior

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:46.110
because this is the place
that actually allows us

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.500
to become the Europeans, right?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.530
This is the place that allows
us to become the Europeans,

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:54.120
but we can never say that.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.490
That can never be said out loud, right?

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.570
So there's this deep tension

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.620
which is built in to all of this.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.620
Okay. So one part of this
is the timing, right?

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.710
Another part of this has to do

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.580
with an encounter in religion.

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:16.435
There probably hasn't been
enough religious history

00:12:16.435 --> 00:12:17.850
in this class,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.060
and it's an important element
of the history of Ukraine,

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:24.990
in particular, distinctiveness
between Ukraine and Russia,

00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:29.070
not just because there's a
Greek Catholic church in Ukraine

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:30.060
and not in Russia,

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.760
not just because church
participation is much higher

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.740
in Ukraine than it is in Russia,

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.680
but maybe mainly because in Ukraine,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.270
there is not a clear relationship

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.810
between church and state the
way that there is in Moscow,

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.545
both at present and historically.

00:12:45.545 --> 00:12:47.250
For many centuries,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.350
the relationship between
the church and the state,

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.470
and including the last 30
years in the lands of Ukraine,

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.630
has been rocky and uneven.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.812
The church has been
repressed by the state.

00:12:56.812 --> 00:12:59.160
It's been a part from the state,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.598
but it's never been
seamlessly woven together

00:13:02.598 --> 00:13:05.040
with the state, and that's
an important difference.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.830
But from the point of view of Moscow,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:09.330
this curious things happens,

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.943
which I mentioned in the
17th century, but it's very,

00:13:10.943 --> 00:13:13.172
it's an important example
of this dialectic.

00:13:13.172 --> 00:13:16.510
The Russian Orthodox
Church, such as it is,

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.960
and now, I'm leaning very
heavily on a dissertation

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.797
by the wonderful Yale PhD
graduate, Ievgeniia Sakal,

00:13:22.797 --> 00:13:26.130
the Russian Orthodox
Church, such as it is,

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:29.760
takes on its form and its
own narration of what it is

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.233
in an encounter with Ukraine.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.580
So if you remember back
to the 18th century

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.530
when the Polish-Lithuanian
Commonwealth collapses,

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.810
there are all of these educated churchmen

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.370
in places like Kyiv and Chernihiv

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.110
and they've been having these
debates with each other,

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:44.010
and they've been having debates

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:45.330
with the Catholics and the Protestants.

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.580
They've been besieged by
the Counter-Reformation.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.557
They've been dealing with
the Jesuits for decades.

00:13:49.557 --> 00:13:53.430
These are very erudite men,

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:55.650
and suddenly, they're confronted
with this new situation

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:57.210
in which there's no longer
the Polish-Lithuanian

00:13:57.210 --> 00:14:00.090
Commonwealth to deal with,
no longer the reformation,

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:01.830
Counter-Reformation, all that's gone,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.461
but there are these fellows in Moscow,

00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:06.840
and they're suddenly subordinate to them.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.240
So what is the story that you tell?

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.800
There's a political story,
I'll return to that,

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.350
but there's also a religious
dispute which takes place.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:15.763
And then this religious dispute,

00:14:15.763 --> 00:14:17.250
authorities in Moscow

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.870
and authorities in Ukraine
have different ideas.

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:20.960
And the authorities in
Moscow have the power.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:23.370
The authorities in Ukraine
have the arguments.

00:14:23.370 --> 00:14:24.470
But what happens over time,

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.840
and this is all verges
on being a general truth,

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.830
the people with the power

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.357
will eventually figure out the arguments

00:14:30.357 --> 00:14:33.000
and they will eventually use them.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.689
So within the space of a generation,

00:14:34.689 --> 00:14:37.680
the church authorities in Moscow

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.810
are also using the same sources

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.100
and the same kinds of arguments

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.230
that the church authorities
in Ukraine are using.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:44.790
In other words, the church
authorities in Moscow,

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:47.820
by way of Ukraine, start reading
the French and the Latin,

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.290
and they start borrowing the arguments

00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:50.700
from the Western theologians,

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.680
and they start disputing
and doing all the things

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.060
that the Ukrainians are doing,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.390
and what they come up with
is this interesting claim.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.790
They claim, well, the reason
that we are different,

00:14:59.790 --> 00:15:02.280
and we are right about
theological matters,

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.990
is that we, the Russian Orthodox Church,

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:05.841
are basically the unbroken,

00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:09.141
continuation of the Byzantine church

00:15:09.141 --> 00:15:11.280
that nothing has really happened.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.887
It's just all a placid pool of non-events.

00:15:14.887 --> 00:15:16.950
"We are pure." Right?

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:18.773
And this is, if you know
anything about Western Orthodoxy,

00:15:18.773 --> 00:15:21.180
this is the account to this day, right?

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.210
That it's a non, basically a
non-historical institution,

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:28.009
but this argument that they're
a non-historical institution

00:15:28.009 --> 00:15:32.970
emerges as a result of historical
encounter with Ukraine,

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.860
very much like the political point,

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.770
which I made in the lectures
a couple of weeks ago.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:42.770
The idea that Kyiv and
Moscow are somehow connected,

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.120
organically connected,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.700
that Moscow fulfills itself
in Kyiv and vice versa

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.600
and all of this,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.947
That is also an argument

00:15:49.947 --> 00:15:52.770
which was made by Ukrainian churchmen

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:57.180
in the late 17th century
facing a new position of power,

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.013
right?

00:15:58.013 --> 00:16:01.200
And you'll remember, it's
a pretty clever argument,

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.180
at least in this short term.

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.230
If you are in Kyiv,

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:05.910
and suddenly you're being ruled by Moscow,

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.961
you make the argument,
"Hey, you and Moscow,

00:16:07.961 --> 00:16:10.273
everything actually came from us in Kyiv.

00:16:10.273 --> 00:16:12.900
"Therefore, we're very important."

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:14.310
But given a generation or two,

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:16.770
that argument will be
turned around against you,

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.900
and it will become something much more

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:23.900
like Kyiv fulfills itself in Moscow.

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.400
It all began in Kyiv,

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.080
but everything fulfills itself in Moscow.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:32.100
And so now, the role of Kyiv
is to be subordinate to Moscow.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.075
But the point is that that
whole argument never emerges

00:16:36.075 --> 00:16:38.820
without Ukraine, right?

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.490
So all of these important
steps in the history

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:44.430
of what's going to become
Russian culture are deeply,

00:16:44.430 --> 00:16:45.930
organically connected with Ukraine.

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.150
Take a literature, right?

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:49.405
Take a literature.

00:16:49.405 --> 00:16:52.540
Okay. Who's the first
important Russian writer

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.650
besides Pushkin?

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:56.483
- [Student] Gogol?

00:16:56.483 --> 00:16:57.316
- Yes, Gogol.

00:16:57.316 --> 00:16:59.550
Who is from?

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.383
- [Student] Ukraine.

00:17:00.383 --> 00:17:01.920
- As everyone knows, from Ukraine, right?

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.110
And his first stories are about Ukraine,

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:06.873
and his family is Ukrainian.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:12.780
Gogol is the turning point

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.130
where the bilinguality
stops being Ukrainian-Polish

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.590
and moves towards being
Ukrainian-Russian, right?

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.480
From the point of view of
the 20th or the 21st century,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.980
you might think, "Well, the
Ukrainians and the Russians,

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.090
they've always been together, blah."

00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.120
No. It was Ukrainian-Polish
was the normal bilingual

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:29.190
character situation for a long time.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.090
In the 19th century,

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.700
Ukrainian-Russians starts
to become the normal one,

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.790
and you have these Ukrainians
who write in Russian.

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.653
If you don't know Gogol, by the way,

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:39.900
after exams, I know,

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.510
but you might wanna start reading
some of his short stories.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.010
If you like the grotesque,

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.000
if you have a taste for things

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.820
like Edgar Allen Poe or Kafka,

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.643
it's truly extraordinary, wonderful stuff.

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.360
But the cliche is that we all come out

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.620
from under Gogol's overcoat,

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.080
which is a play on words
because like an overcoat,

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.680
but also, "The overcoat" is
one of Gogol's most important,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.000
one of his funniest and
most important stories.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.230
But Russian literature comes

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:07.710
from this Ukrainian story, right?

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:12.710
So in all of these levels,
we have the same problem.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:15.630
Another is with educated elites.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.395
So again, by the 20th century,

00:18:17.395 --> 00:18:21.990
there are very impressive
Soviet educational institutions.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:24.720
And by the 19th century,
early 20th century,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.160
Russian imperial ones as well.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.530
But when these two societies merge,

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:31.830
the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy and
Kyiv is far more important

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.320
than any educational institution
in the Russian Empire.

00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.850
And so during the 18th century,

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.710
graduates to the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:41.190
are flooding Petersburg, which
is the capital after 1721,

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.280
with the educated elites who
help govern the empire, right?

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:49.280
So in all of these ways,
the Ukraine is what's needed

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.450
to make a Russian self-assertion,

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.240
but that Russian self-assertion

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.550
has to negate its own sources, right?

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.620
It has to negate its own sources,

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.631
or else, it will seem incomplete.

00:19:03.631 --> 00:19:08.631
Something related happens
at the level of history

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:14.960
where the Russian story,
as I've just described it,

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:21.410
it has to be a story about
political legitimacy, right?

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.870
And again, you can see an
extreme version of this

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.470
in Putin today where Russia
exists and has the right to rule

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.740
because of baptism in Kyiv in 988.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.530
Nothing that's happened between
then and now really matters.

00:19:34.530 --> 00:19:36.810
What you have is an unbroken right to rule

00:19:36.810 --> 00:19:40.980
as a result of a kind of
metaphysical event a long time ago.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:45.270
It's a version of, I mean,
it is actually very much like

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.690
and is a version of these
medieval or early modern stories

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:49.987
where a family says,

00:19:49.987 --> 00:19:52.470
"By the way, we're descended from wolves,

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.680
and not just any wolves, but
the ones who founded Rome,"

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.600
or whatever, right?

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.150
I'm sort of, that's
kind of a Habsburg joke.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.460
But when families, in
families, you have families,

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:03.293
you may know this.

00:20:03.293 --> 00:20:05.340
Families have these kind of,

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.650
probably from your family
tells you this story,

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.640
like you had this great uncle,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.905
he actually invented the airplane.

00:20:09.905 --> 00:20:13.554
If you let families go on like
that, they eventually just,

00:20:13.554 --> 00:20:16.454
everybody comes, has descended
from some king or whatever.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:18.900
I'm making a serious point or trying to,

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.800
which is that history
begins with a genealogy

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.010
that legitimizes eternal power, right?

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.340
So if you're a family,

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:30.357
you have trouble getting at keeping power,

00:20:30.357 --> 00:20:32.730
getting power, not so
hard, blood and treasure.

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.530
It's keeping power which is hard,

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.840
and that requires some kind
of legitimating ideology

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.580
and the idea that you're
gonna keep power forever

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.440
into the future makes more sense

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.880
if you can explain why you've had power

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.710
or should have had power
forever into the past,

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:44.880
and so there's some kind of story

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.400
about how, what, where
you came from, right?

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.960
So a lineage of power,

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:52.233
and that's where political
history comes from, okay.

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:57.092
So now, if you're in the 19th
century and it's Ukraine,

00:20:57.092 --> 00:21:00.450
the move that you make is
you counter political history

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.640
with social history,

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.230
and that's Hrushevsky, right?

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.790
That's Mykhailo Hrushevsky.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.150
You then say, "No. History
isn't just about some kind

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.460
of legitimating story that
makes sense to the people

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.450
who are in power.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.810
It's about actual
continuities in culture."

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:16.643
Right?

00:21:16.643 --> 00:21:19.113
That history is about the people, okay.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:23.820
Then you get into this conversation,

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:27.577
which continues to this
day where if I say,

00:21:27.577 --> 00:21:30.717
"History is not about the
power, it's about the people."

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.790
Okay. At first glance,

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:36.000
that might seem very
much a matter of justice.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.530
But the obvious question is,

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:38.973
okay, who's the people then?

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:43.710
Are the Jews the people?
Are the Poles the people?

00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.450
Is everybody who's on
the terrain the people?

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:46.999
Or is it just the people who know,

00:21:46.999 --> 00:21:50.100
if history is about the
songs and the stories

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.390
and the language,

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:52.890
what about the people
who don't know the songs

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:53.940
and the stories and the language,

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.590
but live on the same territory, right?

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.410
So this is where there begins in Ukraine,

00:21:58.410 --> 00:21:59.370
but not just in Ukraine.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:00.750
It's just Ukraine's a very interesting

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:01.917
and clear case of this.

00:22:01.917 --> 00:22:04.500
And Ukraine begins this, forgive me,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.620
like this dialectic where
neither of these positions is,

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.360
it can be exactly right, right?

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:12.209
The idea that history is about
the people is attractive,

00:22:12.209 --> 00:22:13.140
right?

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:15.570
But if you push it to an extreme

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:17.910
that makes history just
about the ethnicity

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.676
and it becomes ethnic nationalism,

00:22:19.676 --> 00:22:21.967
then there's a counter
argument which says,

00:22:21.967 --> 00:22:25.663
"No, the people are defined by action.

00:22:25.663 --> 00:22:28.800
The nation is a daily plebiscite."

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.720
And so it doesn't matter
whether they're Jews or Germans

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:31.553
or Poles or whatever,

00:22:31.553 --> 00:22:33.540
it's about participation, and cooperation,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.530
and things like this.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.080
That's the political nation.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.970
But if you push that all
the way to this extreme,

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.343
then everything is politics.

00:22:40.343 --> 00:22:43.140
Why can't I make compromises
with some other nation?

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.600
Maybe I can just take money
from this guy over here.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.910
What's wrong with that? It's
all part of me being political.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:49.710
And this is the political nation, right?

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.617
And so neither these positions
can quite be correct,

00:22:52.617 --> 00:22:54.570
at least take into an extreme.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.120
They're in some kind of communication

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.580
with one another the entire time,

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.063
and that discussion is going on today.

00:23:02.063 --> 00:23:04.271
It has to do partly with the Jews,

00:23:04.271 --> 00:23:06.600
the Jews in Ukrainian history,

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.490
which is an example of culture

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.613
which we have to spend
at least a moment on.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:16.020
The Jews of Ukraine are there

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:19.236
because of currents in Polish history.

00:23:19.236 --> 00:23:24.090
The Jews of Ukraine become
Russian imperial subjects

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.453
after Ukraine ceases to
become part of Poland.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.270
The Jews of Ukraine,

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:32.130
see over the course of the 19th century,

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:34.440
their traditional way of
life essentially broken down

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:37.320
as a result of the military
draft and other things.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.120
And the Jews of Ukraine,

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:43.890
or some of them in the late
19th century build up a kind

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.290
of a modern Yiddish literature.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.850
The most important example of this,

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:48.720
which you will have heard of,

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.317
if you come from these traditions
is all of Sholem Aleichem.

00:23:51.317 --> 00:23:54.210
Sholem Aleichem is basically,

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:57.000
and now, I'm stealing idea from
my colleague, Amelia Glaser.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.100
but what Sholem Aleichem
is basically doing

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.850
is he's taking Gogol and his portraits

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:06.210
to the Ukrainian countryside
and making them gentler,

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:09.110
and bringing the Jews into the
center of the conversation,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.761
whereas Gogol at the
beginning of the 19th century

00:24:13.761 --> 00:24:18.761
was very much about taking
mystical pre-enlightenment

00:24:20.543 --> 00:24:23.528
beliefs and working them
into modern literature.

00:24:23.528 --> 00:24:26.460
What Sholem Aleichem was doing
was taking Yiddish language.

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:27.870
That's important. He's writing Yiddish.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:29.310
Yiddish language literature and using it.

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.870
Yiddish, which is an old language

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:32.670
and only newly a literary language,

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:33.840
taking Yiddish and using it

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.490
to write about the problems of modernity.

00:24:35.490 --> 00:24:36.690
And what are the problems of modernity?

00:24:36.690 --> 00:24:41.673
The problems of modernity are socialism,

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.150
romantic love, right.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.680
So the position in Tevye the Dairyman

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.600
is that he has these daughters,

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.307
and you guys know this,
"Fiddler on the Roof," right?

00:24:51.307 --> 00:24:52.410
"Fiddler on the Roof," right.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:53.243
So it's the problems in modernity

00:24:53.243 --> 00:24:56.433
from the point of view of a
Jewish dad, basically, right?

00:24:56.433 --> 00:24:59.026
And the girls, all the
daughters all have some,

00:24:59.026 --> 00:25:01.080
they all do something unexpected thing,

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.570
but each one of the things
they do represents modernity,

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:07.440
like the socialist, the
rejecting the church,

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.400
but even romantic love
itself is a modern idea here.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.233
Okay.

00:25:12.233 --> 00:25:14.940
So this is, so the Jews are,

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:17.700
if there's going to be a
talk of culture in Ukraine,

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.610
the Jews and Jewish history
have to be part of it,

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:25.040
and that includes the broad
destruction of Jewish culture

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.280
at the beginning, not of the second,

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.810
but the First World War

00:25:27.810 --> 00:25:31.493
when the Jews of Western
Russia were deported,

00:25:31.493 --> 00:25:35.010
which was one of the
causes of the pogroms,

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.913
which happened most intensively
in Ukraine during the war.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:44.250
We have to also talk about
the assimilation of Jews

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:46.830
in Ukraine to the Russian language before,

00:25:46.830 --> 00:25:50.640
but especially after the
Bolshevik Revolution.

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.230
And then in Ukraine in particular,

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.210
and I'm just very briefly
referring to material

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.590
that you've read and we've talked about,

00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:58.805
but the mass murder of
most Jews in Ukraine

00:25:58.805 --> 00:26:00.840
during the Holocaust.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.290
And then after that, the return of Jew,

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:05.370
not, return is the wrong word,

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.710
but the immigration or
the movement of Jews

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:10.590
from elsewhere in the Soviet
Union to what is now Ukraine.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:12.960
So Ukraine is now one of the
most important Jewish countries

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.690
in the world, numerically speaking.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:17.490
It's one of the few, you
can count them on one hand,

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.200
countries that have a Jewish president.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.240
It is the only country in
the world that will ever,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.578
now, I'm gonna make a prediction,

00:26:22.578 --> 00:26:25.710
that will ever have a Jewish
president elected by 70%

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:26.880
or more of the vote.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.050
I don't think that's ever gonna happen,

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:29.280
because it won't happen in Israel

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.570
because there're always
two candidates, right?

00:26:30.570 --> 00:26:33.870
So it's hard to, see, I'm
cheating. I'm using math.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:38.870
But this Jewish Ukrainian
culture is a post-war,

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.633
second, third, fourth
generation Ukrainian culture,

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:49.191
but it's clearly part of
what one could think of

00:26:49.191 --> 00:26:53.340
as a political nation, right?

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.450
So the greatest, again,

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:55.590
so now, we're in a situation

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.570
where the greatest Ukrainian
warlord in history is a Jew,

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.569
which proves that God is Jewish
and has a sense of humor.

00:27:02.569 --> 00:27:05.569
(students laughing)

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.730
In the Soviet Union, there's a version,

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.260
and we've talked about this,

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:16.053
of how Ukraine becomes
the Constitutive Other.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:21.060
The Soviet Union needs
things from Ukraine.

00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:26.060
The Soviet Union needs for
Ukraine to be a nation,

00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.680
but then not to be a nation, right?

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:30.900
So it needs for Ukraine.

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:34.170
So, Ukraine, Stalin, Lenin,

00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:36.614
they know that Ukraine is a nation.

00:27:36.614 --> 00:27:38.430
They need Ukraine.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.620
They want as much of Europe as they can,

00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:43.260
but they have to settle for Ukraine.

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:44.670
They need Ukraine to be a nation,

00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.890
but they also need it not to be a threat,

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:50.970
and so that's the dialectic
of the 1920s and 1930s

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.557
where the Ukrainian nation,
Ukrainian literature,

00:27:53.557 --> 00:27:55.740
Ukrainian people are educated.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.900
Literature is supported for a while,

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:01.890
and then it breaks in the early 1930s.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.515
In a similar way,

00:28:03.515 --> 00:28:08.280
the Ukrainian economy has
to exist and not exist.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.610
The Soviet Union needs the
Ukrainian economy because of,

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:14.424
and this is a theme which
literally goes back,

00:28:14.424 --> 00:28:16.117
I mean, a lot of things, people say,

00:28:16.117 --> 00:28:17.190
"Go back to the ancient Greeks,"

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:18.630
but mostly, we're just having fun.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.372
In this case, it really goes
back to the ancient Greeks.

00:28:21.372 --> 00:28:24.193
Ukraine is a bread basket, right?

00:28:24.193 --> 00:28:28.620
Athens depends on grain
from what is now Ukraine,

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:31.500
just as the Soviet Union
depended upon grain

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.450
from what is now Ukraine.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.710
It's a bread basket.

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.620
So they need the economy,

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.350
but they don't want it to
be the Ukrainian economy.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:44.823
It has to be part of a
larger project, right?

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.684
If they had let the Ukrainian
peasants just grow the grain,

00:28:50.684 --> 00:28:52.830
they would've had bigger yields

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.810
than they did under
collected by as agriculture.

00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:56.400
But collective by as agriculture meant

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.410
that it was all under control,

00:28:58.410 --> 00:28:59.820
and it would be the Soviet Union,

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:01.440
which would be in charge
of the distribution

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:02.820
and the exports, right?

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.280
So the Ukrainian economy has to exist

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:06.450
and has to not exist,

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.880
which is a very brief way
of referring to something

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.650
that we have talked about before,

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:13.140
which is the death of
about 4 million inhabitants

00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.943
of Soviet Ukraine during the 1930s.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.860
Something similar can be
said about Ukrainian culture

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.150
after the Second World War.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:26.100
And again, now I'm reviewing a theme.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:31.100
So we need it, but we don't need it.

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.762
And this is, during the Second World War,

00:29:33.762 --> 00:29:36.480
we need, we is now the Politburo, right?

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.410
We is Stalin.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.140
We need Ukraine because the
war is being fought in Ukraine.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.780
And so, we'll talk up
the Ukrainian nation.

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:46.440
We'll even talk about Bohdan
Khmelnytsky as being a hero

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.000
while the war is going on.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.700
When the war is over,
this is all gonna change.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.620
Under Zhdanov, this is
all going to change.

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:53.940
Ukraine is gonna be suspicious.

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.760
The Western Soviet Union
is going to be suspicious.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.266
And then Khrushchev is going to find

00:29:58.266 --> 00:29:59.880
this brilliant solution.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:02.280
And I mean, I don't mean that ironically,

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.987
and as politically, it
has been very powerful.

00:30:04.987 --> 00:30:08.280
If you need the Ukrainian nation,

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.190
you need Ukrainian culture,
but you also don't need it.

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:12.060
What do you do?

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.483
You say it's real,

00:30:13.483 --> 00:30:16.902
but it's reality is
expressed in its merging

00:30:16.902 --> 00:30:19.620
with Russia into something bigger, right?

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:24.210
And so the brilliance
of this move in 1954,

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:26.310
you remember 1954, it's when
they gave out the cigarette,

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.630
like millions of cigarette packs

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.270
with the words, 300 years, on them.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.360
Also, nightgowns, socks too, I think.

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.630
The brilliance of that is
that you're acknowledging

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:37.620
that Ukraine is real,

00:30:37.620 --> 00:30:39.510
but you're just saying
Ukraine's history went

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.670
in a certain direction.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.451
In 1654, Ukrainians made this choice

00:30:44.451 --> 00:30:47.070
and it binds on them forever.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.240
It's been done, right?

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.410
So let's just remember that.

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:51.780
And the Soviet Union is
a version of this choice,

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:52.800
which was made 300 years ago.

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.060
So Ukraine is real.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.014
It's just that Ukraine's
existence is now meaningful

00:30:58.014 --> 00:31:01.680
as part of a larger unit with Russia,

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.500
and that is the version of
how to think about Ukraine,

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.930
which works extremely well

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.891
in Soviet Russia and in Soviet Ukraine

00:31:09.891 --> 00:31:13.290
for a lot of Soviet Ukrainians
for a very long time.

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:17.523
Something like that, some
version of that from 1954.

00:31:19.807 --> 00:31:22.350
And this is an expression,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.350
again, these things aren't just made up.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:30.030
These things are expressions
of the actual politics

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.920
of the actual Soviet Union.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.530
So this might come as a surprise,

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.830
but there haven't actually
been that many Russian leaders

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:41.730
of Russia in the narrow
sense of Russia, right?

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:45.726
So if Russia claims the
ancient dynasty from Kyiv,

00:31:45.726 --> 00:31:49.590
I mean, they were Scandinavians.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.710
And then the Romanovs,
at least after Catherine,

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:54.120
I mean, the only Romanov we can be sure of

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.350
after Catherine was Catherine

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.163
because you always know
who the mother is, right?

00:32:02.758 --> 00:32:05.190
I really have to stop because
I don't have enough time

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:07.080
to talk about Catherine
the way that I'd like

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.030
to talk about Catherine.

00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:11.700
But in the case of the
Romanovs, the only Romanov,

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.130
I mean, this is dead serious
now about the succession.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.360
The only Romanov you can be sure of

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.040
after Catherine is Catherine herself,

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.200
and Catherine was a German.

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.280
So that's not a Russian
origin story, right?

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.720
And then the Bolsheviks,

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.730
okay, Lenin is maybe
the most famous Russian

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:28.320
of the 20th century,

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.620
but how many Russian
grandparents did he have?

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:34.020
That was like a high level question.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:35.170
I'm looking at the TAs.

00:32:36.279 --> 00:32:39.810
One, one.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.328
Stalin's a Georgian.

00:32:41.328 --> 00:32:43.230
Khrushchev is from Russia,

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:45.603
just barely but he grew up in Ukraine.

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.533
Brezhnev, as Jenny has taught me,

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:53.850
was born in Ukraine and
had Ukrainian nationality

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.500
as his passport nationality,

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.710
and changed it to Russian,
changed it to Russia.

00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:59.700
So you have to get,

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.120
oh, and Gorbachev, half Ukrainian family

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.200
from southern Russia,

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.380
and I am old enough to remember
people in Moscow making fun

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.917
of his accent and saying that,

00:33:08.917 --> 00:33:11.850
"He's actually from Ukraine, this guy."

00:33:11.850 --> 00:33:16.850
So you have to basically
get to Yeltsin or Putin

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:19.830
before you're talking about Russians

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:22.200
in an unambiguous sense
running Russia, right?

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:25.710
And so the story of how
we need them, right?

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.210
We need them, but we
can't say we need them,

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:29.790
actually reflects the
history of the Soviet Union

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:30.870
in all of these ways.

00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:32.370
It also reflects that the history

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:33.770
of Soviet industrialization,

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:40.740
where much of what is
important is in Ukraine,

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.830
the coal and the steel, and
then later, the rockets.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.087
A lot of what is important is in Ukraine,

00:33:45.087 --> 00:33:46.500
and so we need Ukraine.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:47.850
We need Ukraine.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:49.860
We need it more than
we say we can need it.

00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.990
And so that's why what we
need has to be incorporated

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.420
into this story about how what
we need doesn't really exist

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.250
on its own, exists with us.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.909
And in case I forget to say this,

00:33:57.909 --> 00:34:00.254
the point of all of this

00:34:00.254 --> 00:34:05.250
is that one can't talk
about Ukrainian culture

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.170
without all the encounters,

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.323
but this is a specific
kind of encounter, right?

00:34:09.323 --> 00:34:11.913
This is a specific kind of encounter.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:17.340
It's a little tiny bit
like US history where,

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.077
with the attitude of whites
towards Blacks where,

00:34:20.077 --> 00:34:21.993
"We are us because of you.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.630
You're what makes us different,

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:28.290
but we can't acknowledge you
for that reason, you see."

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:29.370
The different, see, that's like,

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.380
it's that same kind of pattern.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.060
The difference is the Europe part, right?

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.440
That the Europe part
plays out differently,

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.630
but it's that kind of move, right?

00:34:36.630 --> 00:34:37.800
It's that kind of move.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.780
So just in case I forget to
say that that's the argument,

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:42.510
that it's an encounter, but
it's not like other encounters.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:44.370
It's not like other encounters.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:49.370
But the point of culture is
also, and now, we're gonna get,

00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:53.640
now, we're gonna talk a
little bit more in depth

00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.660
for the next 15 minutes
about the late Soviet period

00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:57.930
in the contemporary period.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.420
The the point of culture though,

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:04.260
would be that even
though all these things,

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.720
all these contingencies
I'm insisting on are true,

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.860
that if you're creating culture,

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:08.940
you're trying just to create,

00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.590
like you're trying to create, right?

00:35:10.590 --> 00:35:11.460
You're trying to create.

00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:15.210
And much of the protests that happen

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:18.480
from the sixties onward
are kind of in that spirit

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.580
where the notion of
Ukrainian culture is not

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.190
that we're trying to defend
Ukrainian national culture,

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:25.500
we're just trying to defend culture.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:27.838
We're just trying to be ourselves.

00:35:27.838 --> 00:35:30.990
And the move that
Ukrainian dissidents make,

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.937
especially in the 70s, is they say,

00:35:33.937 --> 00:35:36.900
"Look, it's not about Ukrainian culture,

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.090
Russian culture writ large.

00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.510
It's not even really primarily
about Russian culture

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.550
and its hegemony,
although that's a problem.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:46.410
What it's really about is the individual."

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:48.193
This is the move they
make in the 70s, right?

00:35:48.193 --> 00:35:52.590
They say human rights
includes the right to be

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.360
from the culture that you're from,

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.970
and that's something inside
you as a person, right?

00:35:56.970 --> 00:35:58.590
And so that has to do,

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:02.583
so that is your normality.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.930
So I'm gonna mention a couple
of crucial examples of this,

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:09.180
and there's only really time for a couple,

00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:13.830
but one is 1965 when,

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:17.910
this is early Brezhnev,

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:20.490
Ukrainians are being persecuted,

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:22.980
and at the same time, a film comes out,

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.300
which I urge you to see,

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:28.007
called "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors"

00:36:28.007 --> 00:36:33.007
which is by a Georgian
Armenian, Sergei Parajanov,

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.090
but it's based on a story

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.550
by a Ukrainian writer called Kotsiubynsky,

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.660
and it's set in the
extreme West Carpathians,

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.530
extreme west of Ukrainian.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:44.580
It's not only in Ukrainian,

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:47.150
it's in Carpathian dialect of Ukrainian.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:51.330
It's not socialist realism.
It's magical realism.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.413
And it's quite weird.

00:36:53.677 --> 00:36:55.105
It's quite weird and beautiful,

00:36:55.105 --> 00:36:59.010
and it's one of the
very best Soviet films,

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.260
if that's even the word.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:02.580
Apropos of this film,

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:06.154
there were protests about
the oppression of Ukrainians.

00:37:06.154 --> 00:37:08.986
One of the people who took part
in these protests was a poet

00:37:08.986 --> 00:37:13.986
called Vasyl Stus, who
loses his job as a result.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.080
I'm gonna read to you one of his poems

00:37:18.261 --> 00:37:23.261
to make this point that
sometimes culture is just trying

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.830
to be culture, right?

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:28.560
And that a lot of the defensive culture

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.080
in the late Soviet
period was on that basis,

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:32.730
that all these things that
I've been explaining to you,

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:33.660
people understood.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.400
That was there. That was sorted out.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.040
But then, somehow it's all meaningless

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.960
unless there's a, there, there, right?

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:41.280
Unless the culture itself is there.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.000
So Stus goes to the Gulag twice.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.680
He ends up dying after
a hunger strike in 1985.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.933
But this is the kind of poetry he wrote.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:55.200
This one is called "A
Stranger Lives My Life

00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.217
and Wears My Body."

00:37:57.937 --> 00:38:01.710
"It seems to me that it is not I who live,

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.030
but another someone lives for me

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.214
in the world taking my shape,

00:38:05.214 --> 00:38:09.450
no eyes, nor ears, nor
hands, nor feet, nor mouth,

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:11.520
estrange to my own body.

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:15.000
And a chunk of pain and closing myself,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:15.990
suspended in the abyss.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.420
And you, though born, just burned

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:19.410
and never grew into the body.

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.060
You never entered the flesh.

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.807
Just a passerby between the worlds,

00:38:22.807 --> 00:38:26.178
having sunk to the bottom
of before in existence.

00:38:26.178 --> 00:38:29.130
A hundred nights ahead, and
a hundred nights behind,

00:38:29.130 --> 00:38:30.967
and between them, a mute doll,

00:38:30.967 --> 00:38:34.020
burned white from self-inflicted
pain like a speck of hell.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.490
The laconic cry of the universe,

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.150
a tiny ray of the sun trapped
and estranged in the body.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:41.236
You are awaiting another
birth for yourself,

00:38:41.236 --> 00:38:45.120
but death entered into you long ago."

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.100
That's my translation from yesterday.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:48.700
It's much prettier in Ukrainian.

00:38:50.130 --> 00:38:51.240
I'm gonna resist the temptation.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.233
It's really nice in Ukrainian.

00:38:52.233 --> 00:38:55.566
Мені здається, що живу не я, а інший хтось 
живе за мене в світі в моїй подобі.&nbsp;
Ні очей, ні вух,ні рук, ні ніг, ні рота.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:01.230
It's very nice in Ukrainian.

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:03.130
Learn Ukrainian. Read it in Ukrainian.

00:39:06.481 --> 00:39:10.467
So Stus goes, is sent, is imprisoned.

00:39:10.467 --> 00:39:12.690
He's released.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:14.910
By the time he comes out,
there's a human rights movement,

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:16.260
the Ukrainian Helsinki Group,

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:18.684
he defends it and then joins it,

00:39:18.684 --> 00:39:22.140
is sent to the Gulag.

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:23.580
Again, he's sent to Perm.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.700
The Gulag in the 70s is much
smaller, but it still exists.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.770
Perm is where I think four members

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:30.600
of the Ukrainian Helsinki Group die.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.023
He is one of them after a hunger strike.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.840
I'm gonna read you
another one of his poems.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.374
We're just gonna do him as a poet today.

00:39:39.374 --> 00:39:41.220
This is not my translation.

00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.840
This is Alan Zhukovski translation,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.610
which was just published a few months ago.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:47.370
This one is called "The
Lord Has Started Being Born

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:48.203
Within Me."

00:39:49.627 --> 00:39:51.390
"The Lord has started
being born within me,

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:53.760
and half-recalled and half-forgotten,

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.770
waits till I depart from life.

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:58.170
It looks as if he is outside
me, at the edge of death

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:00.360
where living people
should not dare to enter.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:03.219
My grandchild and my ancestor, God waits.

00:40:03.219 --> 00:40:05.460
Together on my own, that's how we live,

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.230
how we exist when nobody is near.

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.509
Misfortune thunders like a cannonade.

00:40:09.509 --> 00:40:13.156
He is salvation, so, white-lipped, I say,

00:40:13.156 --> 00:40:15.180
'Please save me for a second, Lord,

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.610
and then, recovered,

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:20.277
I will save myself alone
without assistance.'

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.160
But he wants to leave
my borders and desires

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.110
to finalize my demolition by salvation,

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:26.460
seeking to force me from myself

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:29.640
amid the gusts of chilling
winds, a saber from its scabbard.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.563
He bides his time and wants to get outside

00:40:31.563 --> 00:40:34.050
to make the candle of my pain go out

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.310
so that the darkness of obedience

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:37.110
would save me by the touch of Otherness,

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:39.268
another form of life,
another name no longer mine,

00:40:39.268 --> 00:40:40.770
along with countless people

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.420
inside the kingdom of the frenzied God

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.340
who wishes to be born from deep within me,

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.940
but I'll preserve that
healing flame for longer,

00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.310
to not get caught too
early by the darkness.

00:40:50.310 --> 00:40:53.260
My pain's black candle
fills my road with light

00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:56.937
and represents my stealthy victory."

00:40:58.170 --> 00:41:01.740
So culture carries a
shadow with it, right?

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.510
Culture stands for itself.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:06.630
These poems are, they're
not about politics,

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.070
but culture stands for itself,

00:41:08.070 --> 00:41:10.740
but there's a shadow alongside it.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.380
The shadow from the 1860s
from the Valuev Decree,

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:16.050
the shadow from the 1930s
from famine and terror,

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.480
the shadow of the 1970s
of the assimilation

00:41:20.751 --> 00:41:24.510
and the forced integration from the top,

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.990
which means that when Ukraine emerges

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.890
as an independent state in the 1990s,

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:36.750
culture is pursued very, very gently.

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:39.562
There is no strong Ukrainization policy

00:41:39.562 --> 00:41:40.743
in the beginning.

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.632
Kyiv and Ukraine are
characterized by bilinguality,

00:41:45.632 --> 00:41:48.000
by code-switching, by surzhyk,

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.183
which is the mixing of the two languages.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:57.260
The Europe is portrayed in the beginning.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:59.010
Oh, there's another thing
which is very important

00:41:59.010 --> 00:42:01.950
about Ukrainian culture, which is,

00:42:01.950 --> 00:42:03.567
especially at the beginning,

00:42:03.567 --> 00:42:06.810
oligarchical pluralism,
oligarchical pluralism

00:42:06.810 --> 00:42:10.410
by which I mean when you have
several different oligarchs

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.000
with several different foundations

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.770
and several different TV stations

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.480
and several different this and that,

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:18.497
that's a different situation
from when you have one.

00:42:18.497 --> 00:42:20.357
It may not be the ideal situation,

00:42:20.357 --> 00:42:23.340
but it does mean that
different views emerge

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.050
about art and history and other things

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:26.490
with different patrons.

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:29.880
That was very characteristic
of Ukraine in the 1990s, right?

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.800
And remain, it's coming
less so, but it's still,

00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.050
it's a feature, it's a feature of Ukraine.

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:34.980
Okay.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:39.750
So the early attitude towards Europe,

00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:43.590
I mentioned one novel,
which is again, for fun,

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:47.550
Yuri Andrukhovych, "Perversion."

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:52.170
In this novel, Europe figures
as this kind of postmodern,

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.660
very distant, beautiful
thing, which we never might,

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.940
which we probably never
get to, or if we get to,

00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.900
it'll be a result of all kinds

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.633
of improbable drunken adventures.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.690
That's like the postmodern
carnival version of where we are.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:09.450
We are this outskirt.
We are this province.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:13.023
We reach Europe with our
spectacular literature basically.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.330
This changes, I would say,
around the time of the Maidan

00:43:18.330 --> 00:43:20.340
about what you've read
a book and had a lecture

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:23.580
where Europe starts to
become much more practical.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:24.990
where Europe is not,

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.180
because the politics of
wanting to join Europe

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:29.550
follows the culture of
wanting to join Europe, right?

00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:31.590
And the culture of wanting
to join Europe has to do

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.728
with younger people who
see Europe as a future.

00:43:34.728 --> 00:43:38.970
And so Europe becomes,
somewhere around the 2010,

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:42.330
it's ceasing to become
a kind of strange thing

00:43:42.330 --> 00:43:44.580
which is desired, a
strange object of desire

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:48.597
and more kind of practical
place where we might go.

00:43:48.597 --> 00:43:53.597
And a key figure here would be
Serhyi Zhadan, Serhyi Zhadan,

00:43:55.320 --> 00:44:00.320
who in Kharkiv, in 2014
had his skull broken for,

00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:03.330
this is, I mean, it could not
be more symbolic of the themes

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.400
of this lecture, had his skull broken

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:09.672
after he refused to bow down to Russians

00:44:09.672 --> 00:44:12.120
in a quite literal sense.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:16.830
Zhadan is a great novelist
and also a great poet.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.850
He also has a ska band,
which is a rare threefer,

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:22.490
I have to say.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.280
And when he does win the
Nobel Prize for literature,

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.070
I want that ska band right
in the middle of what they,

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:29.913
all right.

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:33.150
Okay.

00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:38.150
So Zhadan would be an
example of something else,

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:40.650
which is very important,

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:45.650
which is the eastern re-anchoring
of Ukrainian culture,

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:46.943
right?

00:44:46.943 --> 00:44:47.940
So I've made this point,

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:49.020
which is slightly awkward

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.420
if you're from Ivano-Frankivsk or Lviv

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:55.860
which is that the historical
function of Galicia

00:44:55.860 --> 00:45:00.860
was basically 1870s to
1970, 1980s, maybe 1990s.

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:03.390
Right. There was a very
special wolf for Galicia

00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:04.223
in that time,

00:45:04.223 --> 00:45:06.810
and it remains a kind of repository,

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:11.130
a safe place to go, so to
speak, in Ukrainian culture,

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:13.488
but Zhadan is from a Russian
speaking environment,

00:45:13.488 --> 00:45:16.800
and he chooses to write only in Ukrainian

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:19.620
and express himself in Ukrainian

00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:22.637
absent emergency situations.

00:45:22.637 --> 00:45:25.203
So Zhadan was doing that the entire time.

00:45:26.333 --> 00:45:29.610
Zhadan, by the way, is also
someone very much worth reading,

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.599
remarkable short stories
if you don't wanna invest

00:45:31.599 --> 00:45:33.513
in a whole literature.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:36.840
Tremendous, what is the title, Jen?

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.530
Like the last, "The last," or
is it "The First Gay Club?"

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:41.775
Do you remember?

00:45:41.775 --> 00:45:43.140
(student speaking away from mic)

00:45:43.140 --> 00:45:45.510
Okay. He has like, among of the things,

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:48.723
he has really good stories about,

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.900
he has really good stories about things

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:53.445
which approach being political

00:45:53.445 --> 00:45:55.890
without quite being political, right?

00:45:55.890 --> 00:46:00.390
So his story about the gay
club is a good example of that.

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:03.360
Anyway, this eastern anchor
point is very important

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.830
because some people
were doing it all along,

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.991
but then 2014, in Maidan
was a turning point

00:46:06.991 --> 00:46:10.626
where major figures in
Ukrainian culture realized

00:46:10.626 --> 00:46:13.950
that they weren't really
welcome in Russia anymore

00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:15.840
and made a kind of turn.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.920
One of them was someone
called Svyatoslav "Slava" Vakarchuk,

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:22.620
who is the lead singer of Okean Elzy,

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:25.260
which is the biggest rock band.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.570
Traditionally, a very big
following in Belarus and Russia.

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.180
After 2014, this became awkward.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:34.890
Another was the comedian and
writer, Volodymyr Zelenskyy,

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:37.590
who up until 2014, had
a very big following,

00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:38.640
a very big career in Russia,

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.840
and appears in Russian television

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:43.290
until I think early 2000,
maybe late 2013, early 2014,

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.780
but then he realizes
something has changed, right?

00:46:45.780 --> 00:46:48.990
So this is a turning
point for a lot of people.

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.400
And then in 2022,

00:46:51.255 --> 00:46:54.518
we've reached a more
dramatic turning point,

00:46:54.518 --> 00:46:56.367
extremely dramatic turning point

00:46:56.367 --> 00:46:59.370
and where things are happening
so quickly and so violently

00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:01.590
that it's hard to
characterize what's happening,

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:04.440
but a dramatic example of this is,

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.240
is the writer, Volodymyr Rafeienko,

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.250
who was here at Yale
a couple of weeks ago.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:11.700
Volodymyr Rafeienko who
wrote only in Russia,

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:14.310
who didn't even know
Ukrainian, which is unusual,

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:19.310
and who ceased communicating
in Russian entirely

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:22.770
with this war and is now a
Ukrainian language writer,

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:26.190
which is not an easy thing to
do, not an easy thing to do.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.560
It's kind of a remarkable
thing for him to be doing.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.210
He said something very
interesting when he was at Yale.

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:35.160
He said, "We don't choose
language. Language chooses us."

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.950
And it's a strange kind of freedom,

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:41.400
which like, there's profundity,
there's profundity in that.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.233
What's that?

00:47:42.233 --> 00:47:43.066
- [Student] You don't master language.

00:47:43.066 --> 00:47:43.899
- Yeah, you don't, right.

00:47:43.899 --> 00:47:45.990
Yeah. "You don't master
language, language masters you."

00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:49.257
Right. "You don't master
language, language masters you."

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.533
Yeah.

00:47:51.533 --> 00:47:55.765
Не ти володієш мовою, мова оволодіває тобою

00:47:55.765 --> 00:48:00.480
So another example of this
would be another writer

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.810
who was just at Yale, Stanislav Aseyev,

00:48:03.810 --> 00:48:08.221
also from an entirely
Russian speaking background,

00:48:08.221 --> 00:48:11.550
a writer now in Ukrainian,
and a Ukrainian writer

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.830
whose most recent book is about torture,

00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:15.750
and it's actually one of the
best bits of prison writing

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:16.590
that's been produced,

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.013
I think in Eastern Europe
or maybe anywhere else.

00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:24.520
So the final point that I
wanna make about culture

00:48:26.001 --> 00:48:30.390
is that we're looking,

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.280
okay, two more points, indulge me.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.493
We're looking at a new centrality of Kyiv,

00:48:35.493 --> 00:48:38.400
a Kyiv is something
that hasn't been before.

00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:43.180
It's a Kyiv which is asserting
itself as a European capital,

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.990
and that is something new.

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:47.040
Kyiv has been many things

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.790
but a European capital among
other European capitals

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.470
in a modern sense is new,

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:56.640
and a proud Kyiv is something new.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:00.093
And I'm gonna read a poem from Stus,

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.670
which is about Soviet Kyiv,

00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:04.773
and you'll see why I'm doing this.

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.151
It's "Thousand Year Old Kyiv,"

00:49:09.151 --> 00:49:10.265
and this is from,

00:49:10.265 --> 00:49:13.027
translated by Bohdan
Tokarskyi and Uilleam Blacker.

00:49:13.027 --> 00:49:15.450
"One-thousand-year-old Kyiv,
fancied, feeling young again.

00:49:15.450 --> 00:49:17.040
Suddenly, Kyiv was aware of hotels,

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.350
trolleybuses, trams and
trains, the Paton Bridge,

00:49:19.350 --> 00:49:21.508
the ungainly buildings on Khreshchatyk.

00:49:21.508 --> 00:49:23.910
Kyiv licked the rough asphalt
with its pagan tongue,

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:26.340
the slopes of the Green Theatre
became overrun by martens,

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.420
squirrels, aurochs,

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:29.490
and the god Yarylo's
roaring heathen laughter

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:31.380
drove the Dnipro's waves.

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:32.820
Kyiv coughed asthmatically.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:33.900
Through the metro's drafts,

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:35.850
the electric trains fearfully rattled,

00:49:35.850 --> 00:49:37.050
as a dozen layers of ground,

00:49:37.050 --> 00:49:38.730
white from human bones, horses' skulls,

00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:40.980
and gray ash of funeral pyres,

00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:44.040
rippled like the skull
of an angry bull's neck.

00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.603
Kyiv strained but then gave up,

00:49:45.603 --> 00:49:48.240
just how the devil to
lift this whole assemblage

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.980
of new-builds, avenues, motorways,

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.440
and the stately birthless
bellies of the inhabitants?

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.090
May sacred forces strike you down,

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:55.599
heathen Kyiv hurled a curse.

00:49:55.599 --> 00:49:57.870
But then it saw a pack of pioneers,

00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:59.160
and, ashamed, it bowed its head.

00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:00.480
It hid itself away without a peep."

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.860
Pioneers, you have to know.

00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:04.920
Pioneers means communist
youth group, right?

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.570
So Kyiv finally submits.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:09.450
That Kyiv of is now gone, right?

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:11.100
The people who are now in charge
of the government in Kyiv,

00:50:11.100 --> 00:50:13.406
the people are now in
charge of culture in Kyiv

00:50:13.406 --> 00:50:15.450
are of a different generation

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:17.370
that isn't just
post-Soviet or anti-soviet,

00:50:17.370 --> 00:50:19.170
it's just something else.

00:50:19.170 --> 00:50:22.080
And the very last point that
I wanted to make is that,

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:23.310
although it's too soon to evaluate

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:25.560
what this war means for culture,

00:50:25.560 --> 00:50:27.570
one of the very striking things

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:31.200
about this war is the
production of culture within it.

00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:32.610
So other people have noted

00:50:32.610 --> 00:50:35.700
that this is the most
recorded war of all time,

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.600
which is true.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:38.520
I would note that that act of recording

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.620
by a journalist is also an act of culture,

00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:45.620
which requires corporeal
risk-taking as well as intellect,

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:49.020
but just the culture itself is going on.

00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.150
Not to sound too romantic
or pathetic about it,

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:54.210
but right down to and including
in the trenches, right?

00:50:54.210 --> 00:50:56.520
I have colleagues who are
still giving their lectures

00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.800
from where they are right in the trenches,

00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.685
and the production of poetry

00:51:00.685 --> 00:51:02.670
and other forms of culture goes on.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:04.710
So I'm just going to
read you one more poem.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:05.543
Please indulge me.

00:51:05.543 --> 00:51:07.563
This is from Yuliya Musakovska,

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.620
who's a mom who works in IT.

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:14.520
She wrote this in late March,
2022 for her collection,

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:16.299
which is published under the title "Iron."

00:51:16.299 --> 00:51:20.077
Her poem goes like this, this is March.

00:51:20.077 --> 00:51:23.580
"Such problematic, such frightful poems,

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.862
full of anger, so politically incorrect.

00:51:25.862 --> 00:51:30.617
No beauty in these poems,
no aesthetic at all.

00:51:30.617 --> 00:51:33.180
The metaphors withered and fell to pieces

00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.380
before they could bloom.

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:39.480
The metaphors buried in
children's playgrounds

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.160
under hastily raised crosses,

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:44.220
dead in unnatural poses

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:46.443
by the gates of houses covered in dust.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.030
They prepared meals over an open fire.

00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:53.370
They did try to survive.

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:56.643
It was a dehydration that they
perished under the rubble.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:02.620
Shot in a car under a white
flag made from a sheet

00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:06.720
with colorful backpacks
over their shoulder.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.923
They lie on the asphalt face
down next to the cats and dogs.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:13.920
I'm sorry to say so,

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.430
but such verses are all
we have for you today.

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:21.303
Dear ladies and gentlemen,
spectators of the theater of war.

00:52:25.504 --> 00:52:28.087
(somber music)

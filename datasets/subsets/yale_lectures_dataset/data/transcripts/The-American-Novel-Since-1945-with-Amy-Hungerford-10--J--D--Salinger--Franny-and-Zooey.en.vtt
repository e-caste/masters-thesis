00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.236
Professor Amy
Hungerford: In light of the

00:00:05.236 --> 00:00:07.923
fact that I have just sent you
paper topics,

00:00:07.923 --> 00:00:10.860
my lecture today is going to do
two things.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.649
It is going to give you a way
into Franny and Zooey,

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.315
but it's going to actually
give you more than a way into

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:20.800
it.
It is really going to give you

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.150
a whole packaged reading of
Franny and Zooey.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.761
We have just the one day on
this novel, and what I'm going

00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:35.188
to be doing for you is modeling
the way literary critics use

00:00:35.188 --> 00:00:40.242
evidence to advance an argument.
It's useful to you when you

00:00:40.242 --> 00:00:44.050
think about writing a paper to
remember, if it's been a long

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.020
time since you've written an
English paper,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.221
or even if it isn't a long time
since you've written an English

00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:55.052
paper, that the facts that we,
literary critics,

00:00:55.052 --> 00:01:01.115
and you, writers on literature,
the facts that we deal with are

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:06.858
the details of the text itself.
You may have noticed that I am

00:01:06.858 --> 00:01:11.129
very fond of reading aloud to
you from these novels.

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:14.570
I'm very fond of reading out
passages.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.500
I do it a lot.
Why do I do it?

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.926
Well, there are two reasons,
one because I want you to hear

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:26.601
literary art.
Literary art is a verbal art,

00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:30.360
and I think too often we only
read it silently;

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.857
probably not since you were
children that people read to you

00:01:34.857 --> 00:01:37.475
so much.
So, to get a sense of that,

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:41.393
you have to have it in your ear
and feel the sound and the

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:45.520
rhythm and the quality,
the timbre, the expression of

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.830
the voices that we have in these
novels.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.986
Our writer for today thinks so
highly of that capacity of

00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:57.439
literature to embody the human
voice that he imagines a whole

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.035
religious world around him.
That's going to be the gist of

00:02:02.035 --> 00:02:05.819
my argument today.
But then, there is a second,

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:10.727
sort of, less mystical reason,
and that's that these are the

00:02:10.727 --> 00:02:17.060
facts of a literary argument,
these words that I give to you.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.446
It's like, if you're in an
astronomy lecture,

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:22.808
they're going to give you some
facts about the composition of a

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:25.139
planet, or its atmosphere,
or whatever.

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.909
Those are the facts for that
field.

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.069
For this field,
these are the facts.

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.150
So, in your papers,
if you find yourself writing

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.389
and you get to the end of a page
and you look back,

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:43.320
you scan back over your page,
and you see that there are no

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.909
quotation marks,
you are not using any of the

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.549
facts of the novel to produce
your argument,

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.971
to support your claims.
So, that's like the eye test,

00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:59.789
the glance test.
Are you supporting your claims?

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:03.977
If you have very few
quotations, chances are you are

00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:06.360
not.
So, think of this lecture,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.270
as I go through it,
as a kind of model.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.379
Pay attention to what I'm doing
in using these textual bits and

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.490
pieces and putting them together
and making claims for them.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.498
I do it every week.
It just so happens that this

00:03:21.498 --> 00:03:24.708
argument is more closed,
more settled,

00:03:24.708 --> 00:03:27.963
in my own mind.
It's less of an opening

00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:32.530
argument than it is something
that I want to convince you of.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.645
So, there's a reason for that
and that is that I'm writing

00:03:37.645 --> 00:03:40.846
about this novel.
It's in the introduction to a

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:43.889
book that I'm writing about the
literature of this period,

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.113
and so it's very present to my
mind as a sort of piece of a

00:03:47.113 --> 00:03:50.448
larger argument about religion
and the American novel in this

00:03:50.448 --> 00:03:53.789
period,
so that's what I'm giving you.

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:57.669
When you approach any novel
to make an argument about it,

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:02.018
if you want to be ambitious,
the first thing to think about

00:04:02.018 --> 00:04:05.310
is well, what's obvious about
the novel?

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.294
What can you observe at first
glance about its style,

00:04:09.294 --> 00:04:11.822
about its form,
about its setting,

00:04:11.822 --> 00:04:15.729
about its character,
about its presuppositions?

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:18.910
In Franny and Zooey,
what did you notice?

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.281
Tell me what you noticed,
at first bat,

00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:30.563
if any of you have read it.
What did you notice about the

00:04:30.563 --> 00:04:31.970
novel?
Uh huh.Student:

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:33.490
It doesn't move around very
much.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.806
It just stays in a limited
space.Professor Amy

00:04:34.806 --> 00:04:36.290
Hungerford: Absolutely.
Confined settings,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.790
very confined settings,
absolutely.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.060
Yes.
What else?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.284
Yes.Student:
A lot of

00:04:42.284 --> 00:04:44.574
dialog?Professor Amy
Hungerford: Lots of dialog,

00:04:44.574 --> 00:04:46.199
yes.
What else?

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.355
Uh huh.Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.320
Amy Hungerford:
Yeah, yeah.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:52.460
Absolutely.
Yeah.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.993
There's a back story.
You can feel that back story to

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:55.910
the novel.
Yeah.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.420
What else?
What else did you notice?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.396
Yes.Student:
There's a lot of focus on

00:05:01.396 --> 00:05:03.689
like little motions that people
do,

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:06.211
like picking up cigarettes and
dropping things.Professor

00:05:06.211 --> 00:05:07.310
Amy Hungerford:
Yeah.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.115
A lot of attention to physical
detail and physical movement,

00:05:11.115 --> 00:05:14.920
and that's connected to this
point about confined spaces.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.638
It's the movement of bodies
within confined spaces that

00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:20.893
really preoccupies this novel.
What about the style of the

00:05:20.893 --> 00:05:22.540
novel?
You talked about dialog.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.730
Is there anything else about
the style that you noticed?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:27.983
Yes.Student:
There's a lot of

00:05:27.983 --> 00:05:29.654
italics.Professor Amy
Hungerford: A lot of

00:05:29.654 --> 00:05:31.648
italics.
What does that connote to

00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:34.158
you?Student:
Trying to convey

00:05:34.158 --> 00:05:37.569
feeling.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yeah.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.109
Absolutely.
A lot of emphasis,

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:42.187
a lot of variation in tone,
and the italics are part of the

00:05:42.187 --> 00:05:46.819
representation of that.
Yeah. What else?

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.540
Yes.Student:
A lot of the dialog seems

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.527
to be combative.
There's arguing between two

00:05:52.527 --> 00:05:53.417
people.
Professor Amy

00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:55.614
Hungerford: Yes.
This is a book about arguments,

00:05:55.614 --> 00:05:58.848
absolutely.
What are they arguing about

00:05:58.848 --> 00:06:00.520
most of the time?

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.778
All right.
Well, that's where I will pick

00:06:06.778 --> 00:06:07.820
up.
Oh, Sarah.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.334
Do you want to say?
Student:

00:06:09.334 --> 00:06:11.477
There are a lot of abstract
ideas.Professor Amy

00:06:11.477 --> 00:06:12.650
Hungerford: Yeah.
Yeah.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.218
Absolutely.
They are talking about abstract

00:06:15.218 --> 00:06:17.389
intellectual ideas,
often religious or

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:20.964
philosophical ones,
and that, plus its setting:

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:26.210
I hope you noticed the sort of
New Havenish setting of Franny's

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.545
breakdown.
We're told that Lane isn't

00:06:29.545 --> 00:06:33.758
exactly a Yale man,
but he sure looks a lot like a

00:06:33.758 --> 00:06:40.454
Yale English major,
dare I say, such an unpleasant

00:06:40.454 --> 00:06:45.420
character, and so,
so pompous.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.242
What you do,
when you write a paper or try

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:53.489
to advance an argument,
is try to write an argument

00:06:53.489 --> 00:06:59.009
that will attend to all those
things that you guys just said,

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:03.336
that you take the obvious
things, and when you craft an

00:07:03.336 --> 00:07:07.142
argument, the best thing,
the most ambitious thing,

00:07:07.142 --> 00:07:09.770
to do is to come up with
something where,

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.996
in the end,
you can say something about

00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:16.744
those major aspects.
You don't have to do it in the

00:07:16.744 --> 00:07:20.394
paper, but it should be an
argument that has something to

00:07:20.394 --> 00:07:22.740
say back to those obvious
things.

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.422
Why is the style this way?
Why is the plot working this

00:07:26.422 --> 00:07:28.527
way?
Why are these particular

00:07:28.527 --> 00:07:34.879
characters behaving in this way?
Why use those confined spaces?

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:40.374
So, my argument today is
going to try to have something

00:07:40.374 --> 00:07:46.343
to say back to all those obvious
aspects that you pointed out so

00:07:46.343 --> 00:07:49.696
rightly.
But I'm going to start from a

00:07:49.696 --> 00:07:52.600
much more pointed and local
question.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.412
And this is the other thing
that a good short paper

00:07:56.412 --> 00:07:59.767
especially does,
is that you don't get at all

00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:03.579
that big stuff by,
kind of, taking it head on.

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:08.104
You have to come down to the
facts that I was talking about,

00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:10.635
the bits of text,
the text itself,

00:08:10.635 --> 00:08:15.189
the words that author chose;
that's where you begin.

00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:21.099
And part of the genius of a
strong paper is choosing the

00:08:21.099 --> 00:08:26.579
place in the text to begin that
pointed analysis.

00:08:26.579 --> 00:08:34.201
So, my choice for this is that
odd introduction in-between the

00:08:34.201 --> 00:08:39.200
two stories, and this is on 48
and 49.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.188
This is, we come to find out,
Buddy, Zooey's older brother,

00:08:45.188 --> 00:08:49.794
narrating the story,
and Buddy gives us a little

00:08:49.794 --> 00:08:54.809
preamble telling us how the real
characters in the story,

00:08:54.809 --> 00:08:59.394
the real people who are then
characters in his story,

00:08:59.394 --> 00:09:04.683
how they felt about the story
and what their objections to it

00:09:04.683 --> 00:09:07.240
were (and this is on 48).

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:15.459
We find out that Franny objects
to the story's distribution in

00:09:15.459 --> 00:09:19.870
the world or the movie,
the prose home movie as Buddy

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:24.669
calls it, because it shows her
blowing her nose a lot.

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:29.548
His mother, Bessie,
objects because it shows her in

00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:33.537
her housecoat.
But Zooey has a more

00:09:33.537 --> 00:09:37.637
substantive objection.
It's the leading man,

00:09:37.637 --> 00:09:40.494
however, who has made the most
eloquent appeal to me to call

00:09:40.494 --> 00:09:43.657
off the production.
[This is in the middle of page

00:09:43.657 --> 00:09:45.964
48.]
He feels that the plot hinges

00:09:45.964 --> 00:09:48.970
on mysticism or religious
mystification.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:51.497
In any case,
he makes it very clear,

00:09:51.497 --> 00:09:55.470
a too vividly apparent
transcendent element of sorts,

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.821
which he says he's worried can
only expedite,

00:09:58.821 --> 00:10:03.009
move up, the day and hour of my
professional undoing.

00:10:03.009 --> 00:10:06.273
People are already shaking
their heads over me and any

00:10:06.273 --> 00:10:10.090
immediate further professional
use on my part of the word "God"

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.907
except as a familiar,
healthy American expletive will

00:10:13.907 --> 00:10:18.167
be taken or rather confirmed as
the very worst kind of name

00:10:18.167 --> 00:10:22.134
dropping and a sure sign that
I'm going straight to the

00:10:22.134 --> 00:10:24.985
dogs.
And then, he speaks back to

00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:26.440
Zooey.
He says, "Well,

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.159
I'm going to still distribute
my story.

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:33.009
I still want to tell this
story," and he does it in a kind

00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:38.049
of roundabout way.
And this is on page 49.

00:10:38.049 --> 00:10:41.163
Somewhere in The Great
Gatsby, which was my Tom

00:10:41.163 --> 00:10:44.434
Sawyer when I was twelve,
the youthful narrator remarks

00:10:44.434 --> 00:10:47.982
that everybody suspects himself
of having at least one of the

00:10:47.982 --> 00:10:51.590
cardinal virtues and he goes on
to say that he thinks his,

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:55.643
bless his heart, is honesty.
Mine, I think,

00:10:55.643 --> 00:11:00.506
is that I know the difference
between a mystical story and a

00:11:00.506 --> 00:11:04.205
love story.
I say that my current offering

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:09.126
isn't a mystical story or a
religiously mystifying story at

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:12.688
all.
I say it's a compound or

00:11:12.688 --> 00:11:18.750
multiple love story,
pure and complicated.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.612
What Buddy does,
in this passage,

00:11:21.612 --> 00:11:26.532
is set up this opposition
between his own reading of his

00:11:26.532 --> 00:11:30.459
story and Zooey's.
Now, why are we given these

00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:33.203
objections?
I think it's to give us a

00:11:33.203 --> 00:11:37.399
dynamic sense of the family
conversation going on between

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:41.820
them, but it also addresses one
of those obvious things.

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.043
They talk a lot,
as Sarah said,

00:11:44.043 --> 00:11:48.340
they talk a lot about abstract
questions, and this puts the

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.120
meaning of the story in that
abstract register.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.877
Is it a love story,
or is it a religious story,

00:11:56.877 --> 00:12:00.580
a mystifying story?
Which is it?

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:03.809
I am going to argue that it's
both.

00:12:03.809 --> 00:12:09.136
And I'm going to advance that
argument by going straight to

00:12:09.136 --> 00:12:14.462
the theological question that
Zooey is so intent on solving

00:12:14.462 --> 00:12:19.879
when Franny is having her
breakdown in the living room.

00:12:19.879 --> 00:12:24.661
So, just to review:
Franny has her breakdown when

00:12:24.661 --> 00:12:30.141
she comes into what I suspect is
New Haven to attend the

00:12:30.141 --> 00:12:34.624
Yale-Harvard football game with
her boyfriend,

00:12:34.624 --> 00:12:38.901
Lane.
So, Franny when she sees Lane,

00:12:38.901 --> 00:12:44.735
affects great enthusiasm,
and so on, but this is what we

00:12:44.735 --> 00:12:48.660
hear about Lane from the
narrator.

00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:54.241
This is on page 11.
Lane was speaking now as

00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:57.864
someone does who has been
monopolizing conversation for a

00:12:57.864 --> 00:13:01.811
good quarter of an hour or so
and who believes he has just hit

00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:05.500
a stride where his voice can do
absolutely no wrong.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.210
[I always read this and I
think, "I'm lecturing."]

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:12.465
"I mean, to put it crudely,'"
he was saying,

00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:16.630
"the thing you could say he
lacks is testicularity.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:19.615
You know what I mean?"
He was slouched rhetorically

00:13:19.615 --> 00:13:22.517
forward toward Franny,
his receptive audience,

00:13:22.517 --> 00:13:26.000
a supporting forearm on either
side of his martini.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.360
"Lacks what?"
Franny said.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.980
She had had to clear her throat
before speaking.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.570
It had been so long since she
had said anything at all.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.600
Lane hesitated.
"Masculinity," he said.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.721
"I heard you the first time."
"Anyway, it was the motif of

00:13:39.721 --> 00:13:43.509
the thing, so to speak,
what I was trying to bring out

00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:46.701
in a fairly subtle way,"
Lane said, very closely

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.170
following the trend of his own
conversation.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:52.370
"I mean God.
I honestly thought it was going

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.126
to go over like a goddamn lead
balloon and when I got it back

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:59.694
with this goddamn A on it in
letters about six feet high I

00:13:59.694 --> 00:14:03.669
swear I nearly keeled over."
Franny again cleared her throat.

00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:07.131
Apparently, her self-imposed
sentence of unadulterated good

00:14:07.131 --> 00:14:09.340
listenership had been fully
served.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.060
"Why?"
she asked.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.679
Lane looked faintly interrupted.
"Why what?"

00:14:13.679 --> 00:14:16.510
"Why did you think it was going
to go over like a lead balloon?"

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.900
"I just told you.
I just got through saying this

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:23.598
guy, Brughman is a big Flaubert
man or at least I thought he

00:14:23.598 --> 00:14:24.940
was."
"Oh," Franny said.

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:30.817
She smiled.
Franny is disgusted by his

00:14:30.817 --> 00:14:34.188
pomposity.
This experience,

00:14:34.188 --> 00:14:38.900
combined with her experience in
a religion seminar with this

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.143
man,
Professor Tupper,

00:14:41.143 --> 00:14:45.994
at school, has convinced
herself that the world is

00:14:45.994 --> 00:14:50.540
superficial,
that it's impossible to find

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:56.442
anything meaningful in the
academic discussion of these

00:14:56.442 --> 00:15:02.713
pseudo-intellectual problems,
the "testicularity" of one

00:15:02.713 --> 00:15:07.847
writer or another.
And Lane's engagement with

00:15:07.847 --> 00:15:14.779
literature, specifically,
is all about his ego inflation.

00:15:14.779 --> 00:15:18.914
So, he can't wait to tell
Franny that the professor said

00:15:18.914 --> 00:15:22.896
he should try to publish it,
and then my favorite thing:

00:15:22.896 --> 00:15:26.350
he wants to read it to her over
the football weekend.

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:30.700
"Hey, come, let's read my
English essay."

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.890
Hello.
Student: Hi.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.820
Can I interrupt?
We have a couple of singing

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:34.939
valentines.
Can we deliver them

00:15:34.939 --> 00:15:36.544
now?Professor Amy
Hungerford: No,

00:15:36.544 --> 00:15:39.080
you can't.
Sorry.

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:44.815
Student:
Thank you.Professor

00:15:44.815 --> 00:15:45.477
Amy Hungerford:
And I'm worried about

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:45.660
e-mail!

00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:54.530
Talk about pricking my
pomposity.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:58.734
All right.
So, she starts saying the Jesus

00:15:58.734 --> 00:16:03.025
prayer, which is,
"Lord Jesus Christ,

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:08.149
Son of God, have mercy on me,
a sinner."

00:16:08.149 --> 00:16:11.486
Now, she has taken this prayer
from a book called The Way of

00:16:11.486 --> 00:16:14.341
the Pilgrim.
It's a Russian Orthodox

00:16:14.341 --> 00:16:16.987
religious classic,
a very old text,

00:16:16.987 --> 00:16:20.100
and it depicts the life of a
pilgrim.

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.640
And we get the summary of this
a little bit in the novel,

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:26.484
as Franny explains it,
or tries to explain it,

00:16:26.484 --> 00:16:29.139
to Lane, who is entirely
uninterested.

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:33.975
It is about a man who tries to
take seriously the Bible's

00:16:33.975 --> 00:16:38.551
injunction to pray without
ceasing, and the prayer for

00:16:38.551 --> 00:16:43.910
Franny becomes a kind of mantra.
She is trying to say it over

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:48.412
and over again as she goes about
in this world that is so

00:16:48.412 --> 00:16:52.190
disappointing to her,
feels so false to her.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.509
And so, finally,
the strain of trying to hold

00:16:56.509 --> 00:17:01.908
out this kind of religious
awareness in the face of Lane

00:17:01.908 --> 00:17:06.130
and his English paper is just
too much,

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.255
and she faints.
Now, Zooey has a big

00:17:10.255 --> 00:17:14.617
problem with her use of this
prayer, and this is what gives

00:17:14.617 --> 00:17:19.280
the book that sort of combative
tone that we were talking about

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.740
a little earlier that somebody
mentioned.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:27.737
So, if you look on page 169,
my question now is,

00:17:27.737 --> 00:17:32.203
in my argument:
What is Zooey's critique of

00:17:32.203 --> 00:17:38.820
Franny's use of the prayer?
What constitutes that critique?

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.520
What's wrong with it?

00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:48.809
So, on 169, he says to Franny
as she's sniveling on the couch:

00:17:48.809 --> 00:17:50.599
"God almighty,
Franny," he said.

00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:53.133
"If you're going to say the
Jesus prayer,

00:17:53.133 --> 00:17:56.933
at least say it to Jesus and
not to Saint Francis and Seymour

00:17:56.933 --> 00:18:00.099
and Heidi's grandfather all
wrapped up in one.

00:18:00.099 --> 00:18:03.269
Keep Him in mind if you say it,
and Him only,

00:18:03.269 --> 00:18:07.520
and Him as He was and not as
you'd like Him to have been.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.454
You don't face any facts.
This same damned attitude of

00:18:11.454 --> 00:18:15.075
not facing facts is what got you
into this messy state of mind in

00:18:15.075 --> 00:18:17.231
the first place,
and it can't possibly get you

00:18:17.231 --> 00:18:20.562
out of it." 
And then, this argument goes on

00:18:20.562 --> 00:18:24.877
for a couple of pages,
and I'm just going to pick up

00:18:24.877 --> 00:18:28.600
the end of it here,
on the bottom of 171.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:33.185
He is explaining who Jesus was.
"If you don't understand

00:18:33.185 --> 00:18:35.620
Jesus, you can't understand His
prayer.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:39.075
You don't get the prayer at all.
You just get some kind of

00:18:39.075 --> 00:18:42.019
organized cant.
Jesus was a supreme adept,

00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:44.920
by God, on a terribly important
mission.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:48.509
This was no Saint Francis with
enough time to knock out a few

00:18:48.509 --> 00:18:51.919
canticles or to preach to the
birds or do any of the other

00:18:51.919 --> 00:18:55.150
endearing things so close to
Franny Glass's heart.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:58.740
I'm being serious now, goddamit.
How can you miss seeing that?

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.762
If God had wanted somebody with
Saint Francis's consistently

00:19:01.762 --> 00:19:04.579
winning personality for the job
in the New Testament,

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.299
He'd have picked him,
you can be sure.

00:19:06.299 --> 00:19:09.391
As it was, He picked the best,
the smartest,

00:19:09.391 --> 00:19:12.122
the most loving,
the least sentimental,

00:19:12.122 --> 00:19:16.579
the most unimitative master He
could have possibly picked.

00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:19.507
And when you miss seeing that,
I swear to you,

00:19:19.507 --> 00:19:23.410
you're missing the whole point
of the Jesus prayer."

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:28.940
So, Zooey's critique is that
Franny is not being specific in

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:34.131
her use of the prayer.
She's paying no attention to

00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:40.960
who Jesus was and what it means
to actually pray to that figure.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.250
But, to anyone paying attention
to the other things that Zooey

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:51.019
says and the other things that
he does in this novel,

00:19:51.019 --> 00:19:55.710
this is kind of odd,
and it's hard to square.

00:19:55.710 --> 00:20:00.061
So, my next kind of question
is: How does that very

00:20:00.061 --> 00:20:04.065
doctrinally specific
understanding of the Jesus

00:20:04.065 --> 00:20:08.939
prayer relate to the whole
religious education that Buddy

00:20:08.939 --> 00:20:13.079
and Seymour gave him,
and that he seems to be

00:20:13.079 --> 00:20:17.124
thinking so hard about as he
reads that letter in the

00:20:17.124 --> 00:20:20.702
bathtub?
The letter in the bathtub tells

00:20:20.702 --> 00:20:24.830
us about that education,
and let's look on 61.

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:41.171
Sorry.
That's not exactly the right

00:20:41.171 --> 00:20:42.190
page.
This is 65.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.310
I'm sorry.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:52.443
In this letter Buddy explains
to Zooey what he and Seymour

00:20:52.443 --> 00:20:55.586
have been trying to do.
"Much,

00:20:55.586 --> 00:20:59.871
much more important though,"
[Buddy says in the middle of 65]

00:20:59.871 --> 00:21:02.799
"Seymour had already begun to
believe,

00:21:02.799 --> 00:21:07.487
and I agreed with him as far as
I was able to see the point,

00:21:07.487 --> 00:21:11.460
that education by any name
would smell as sweet,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.517
and maybe much sweeter,
if it didn't begin with a quest

00:21:14.517 --> 00:21:17.213
for knowledge at all,
but with a quest,

00:21:17.213 --> 00:21:20.410
as Zen would put it,
for no-knowledge.

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:22.422
Dr.
Suzuki says somewhere,

00:21:22.422 --> 00:21:25.885
that to be in a state of pure
consciousness,

00:21:25.885 --> 00:21:29.105
satori, is to be with God
before He said,

00:21:29.105 --> 00:21:33.205
'Let there be light.'
Seymour and I thought it might

00:21:33.205 --> 00:21:37.119
be a good thing to hold back
this light from you and Franny,

00:21:37.119 --> 00:21:39.924
at least as far as we were
able, and all the many lower,

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:42.269
more fashionable lighting
effects--the arts,

00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:46.000
sciences, classics,
languages--'til you were both

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.585
able at least to conceive of a
state of being where the mind

00:21:50.585 --> 00:21:52.995
knows the source of all light."

00:21:53.849 --> 00:22:00.455
So, the religious education
that Zooey's response to Franny

00:22:00.455 --> 00:22:05.351
comes out of,
is precisely not a doctrinally

00:22:05.351 --> 00:22:11.232
specific Christian education.
Rather, it's something more

00:22:11.232 --> 00:22:14.220
like a Buddhist tradition,
a syncretic,

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.075
mystical tradition.
The idea is that there is some

00:22:19.075 --> 00:22:23.952
state of being with God.
Knowledge, all the arts and

00:22:23.952 --> 00:22:28.159
sciences, literature,
all of the religious writings

00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:33.461
of the world are manifestations
of that voice that at its origin

00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:36.310
is God saying,
"Let there be light."

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:43.666
It's the voice of creation.
Seymour and Buddy want Franny

00:22:43.666 --> 00:22:49.255
and Zooey to rest at that
origin, undistracted by the

00:22:49.255 --> 00:22:54.700
manifestations of the creation,
and know some kind of

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.769
consciousness of God in that
place.

00:22:57.769 --> 00:23:05.317
So, Zooey, pretty much,
subscribes to these tenets,

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:14.224
and you can see it especially
on page 175, when he goes into

00:23:14.224 --> 00:23:20.013
his brother's old room.
Now, let me explain a

00:23:20.013 --> 00:23:23.645
detail that I think is
important, but I think a little

00:23:23.645 --> 00:23:26.730
lost to us in today's world of
technology.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:32.029
There's a phone in Buddy and
Seymour's old room that is a

00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:36.951
private internal line,
and it just goes from one room

00:23:36.951 --> 00:23:41.940
to another in the apartment;
it's not an outside phone line.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.869
And what's interesting about
it, and what indicates its

00:23:45.869 --> 00:23:49.316
importance to Buddy,
is that Bessie gets on about

00:23:49.316 --> 00:23:53.339
him getting a phone where he's
teaching in upstate New York;

00:23:53.339 --> 00:23:56.654
he's teaching writing as a
visiting writer at a college in

00:23:56.654 --> 00:23:59.142
upstate New York.
And Bessie, his mother,

00:23:59.142 --> 00:24:01.487
keeps saying,
"Well, why won't you get a

00:24:01.487 --> 00:24:04.719
phone, Buddy?
You're paying to maintain this

00:24:04.719 --> 00:24:09.559
interior line in our apartment,
and yet you won't get a phone."

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:14.988
For Buddy, the phone that's
within the family compound,

00:24:14.988 --> 00:24:17.904
so to speak,
family apartment,

00:24:17.904 --> 00:24:22.730
is the more important line of
communication.

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.152
So, when Zooey goes upstairs to
use that phone,

00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:30.467
it's freighted with all the
significance that Buddy has put

00:24:30.467 --> 00:24:35.743
upon it.
But there's a whole ritual

00:24:35.743 --> 00:24:43.500
involved in Zooey's entrance
into this place.

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.410
This is on 175.

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.891
At the far end of the
hall he went into the bedroom he

00:24:51.891 --> 00:24:53.809
had once shared with his twin
brothers,

00:24:53.809 --> 00:24:56.471
which now, in 1955,
was his alone,

00:24:56.471 --> 00:25:01.150
but he stayed in his room for
not more than two minutes.

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:04.039
When he came out,
he had on the same sweaty

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:06.050
shirt.
There was, however,

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:10.279
a slight but fairly distinct
change in his appearance.

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:15.109
He had acquired a cigar and
lighted it, and for some reason

00:25:15.109 --> 00:25:18.440
he had an unfolded white
handkerchief,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:23.365
draped over his head,
possibly to ward off rain,

00:25:23.365 --> 00:25:27.650
or hail, or brimstone.
So, why does he do this?

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:32.419
What's the meaning of this
little detail of Zooey's

00:25:32.419 --> 00:25:35.316
appearance?
Well, one thing that a literary

00:25:35.316 --> 00:25:38.096
argument can do is take
something small like this and

00:25:38.096 --> 00:25:41.569
try to give an account for it,
so that's what I'm going to do.

00:25:41.569 --> 00:25:47.920
He's venerating the room that
Seymour and Buddy occupied.

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.054
He's covering his head in a
traditional religious fashion,

00:25:53.054 --> 00:25:58.280
so in order to enter this holy
place he covers his head.

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.400
(The cigar?
I don't have an account of that.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.812
You guys figure that out.
That's the other nice thing

00:26:04.812 --> 00:26:07.874
about literary arguments.
There are always little details

00:26:07.874 --> 00:26:11.732
that they don't account for,
and that's the loose thread

00:26:11.732 --> 00:26:15.029
that you can pull to make your
own.) And so,

00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:20.269
what does he find when he goes
in to this holy space?

00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:25.087
Well, he finds two panels of
beaver board,

00:26:25.087 --> 00:26:31.667
on 178,179, and they have the
quotations that Seymour and

00:26:31.667 --> 00:26:38.599
Buddy have collected from all
their favorite religious,

00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:42.717
philosophical,
mystical, literary reading,

00:26:42.717 --> 00:26:47.840
and I'd like you just to think
about one of them.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.880
So this is the bottom of 178.
This is from Sri Rama Krishna.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.175
"Sir, we ought to teach
the people that they are doing

00:26:58.175 --> 00:27:02.690
wrong in worshipping the images
and pictures in the temple."

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.367
Rama Krishna:
"That's the way with you

00:27:05.367 --> 00:27:08.569
Calcutta people.
You want to teach and preach.

00:27:08.569 --> 00:27:12.400
You want to give millions when
you are beggars yourselves.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.341
Do you think God does not know
that He is being worshipped in

00:27:16.341 --> 00:27:20.271
the images and pictures?
If a worshipper should make a

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:24.789
mistake, do you not think God
will know his intent?"

00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:29.439
This is, I think one,
of the best examples of that

00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:34.848
syncretic view of religion,
that basically all worshippers

00:27:34.848 --> 00:27:40.211
are worshipping the same god.
They may do it in different

00:27:40.211 --> 00:27:43.319
forms;
they may make mistakes;

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:46.799
they may be mistaken about
where God resides.

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:50.219
But, in this view,
God is so powerful and so

00:27:50.219 --> 00:27:55.150
transcendent that God will know
the heart of the worshipper.

00:27:55.150 --> 00:28:03.022
So, if you apply that back to
Franny, why does Zooey have this

00:28:03.022 --> 00:28:06.115
difficulty?
Why does he have this

00:28:06.115 --> 00:28:09.150
difficulty in the specificity of
her prayer?

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:13.359
What is it that is bothering
him?

00:28:13.359 --> 00:28:19.368
Well, I think you begin to get
an answer to this tension

00:28:19.368 --> 00:28:25.705
between specific doctrine and
syncretic religion when Zooey

00:28:25.705 --> 00:28:31.383
gets to the subject of acting,
which is what this second

00:28:31.383 --> 00:28:35.860
attempt at speaking to Franny,
this time over the phone,

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:41.068
is concerned with.
There is a detail here of

00:28:41.068 --> 00:28:44.674
course that Zooey,
in making a second attempt to

00:28:44.674 --> 00:28:49.843
converse with Franny about this,
impersonates his brother,

00:28:49.843 --> 00:28:53.911
Buddy, on the phone.
Now I'm just going to leave

00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:56.700
that observation,
remind you of that.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.680
I have a way to account for
that, but it's going to take to

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.529
the end of my argument to do
that,

00:29:01.529 --> 00:29:04.160
so I'm going to argue that
that's significant,

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.609
but I'm not going to talk about
why it's significant yet.

00:29:07.609 --> 00:29:11.050
But let's look at that
theology of acting.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:12.590
This is on page 198.

00:29:15.809 --> 00:29:19.820
This is coming towards the
climax of their conversation.

00:29:22.839 --> 00:29:26.480
Part of what's been bothering
Franny is her frustration with

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:30.244
acting, and that's one of the
things that Lane is so surprised

00:29:30.244 --> 00:29:32.613
she has given up;
it was the only thing she was

00:29:32.613 --> 00:29:35.143
passionate about.
And we know--from reading

00:29:35.143 --> 00:29:39.542
Buddy's letter over Zooey's
shoulder in the bathtub--we know

00:29:39.542 --> 00:29:44.240
that Zooey had similar concerns
about his own acting career,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:51.483
his own commitment to acting
that Buddy tried to persuade him

00:29:51.483 --> 00:29:54.217
out of.
"You can say the Jesus

00:29:54.217 --> 00:29:57.569
prayer" [Zooey says to Franny],
"from now 'til doomsday,

00:29:57.569 --> 00:30:00.557
but if you don't realize that
the only thing that counts in

00:30:00.557 --> 00:30:02.359
the religious life is
detachment,

00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:05.430
I don't see how you'll ever
even move an inch.

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:08.179
Detachment, buddy,
and only detachment,

00:30:08.179 --> 00:30:11.580
desirelessness,
cessation from all hankering.

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.215
It's this business of desiring.
If you want to know the goddam

00:30:15.215 --> 00:30:17.730
truth, that makes an actor in
the first place.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:20.420
Why are you making me tell you
things you already know?

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.111
Somewhere along the line in one
damn incarnation or another,

00:30:24.111 --> 00:30:26.802
if you like,
you not only had a hankering to

00:30:26.802 --> 00:30:30.920
be an actor or an actress,
but to be a good one.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.989
You're stuck with it now.
You can't just walk out on the

00:30:33.989 --> 00:30:36.891
results of your own hankerings.
Cause and effect,

00:30:36.891 --> 00:30:40.375
buddy, cause and effect.
The only thing you can do now,

00:30:40.375 --> 00:30:43.460
the only religious thing you
can do, is act.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.346
Act for God if you want to,
be God's actress if you want

00:30:47.346 --> 00:30:51.309
to.
What could be prettier?" 

00:30:51.309 --> 00:30:57.405
Zooey has this understanding of
the cosmos that suggests that

00:30:57.405 --> 00:31:03.399
strong, specific human desires
actually change the course of

00:31:03.399 --> 00:31:06.531
cosmic futures.
So somewhere,

00:31:06.531 --> 00:31:11.984
maybe in pre-incarnational time
before Franny became Franny,

00:31:11.984 --> 00:31:17.575
she wanted to be an actress.
The religious thing Zooey says

00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:20.573
is to inhabit that,
to honor that,

00:31:20.573 --> 00:31:25.480
to follow up on the results of
that prior desiring.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.774
But why is it acting?
Why specifically acting and why

00:31:29.774 --> 00:31:34.359
this weird comment at the end,
"What could be prettier?"

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:38.240
What does prettiness have to do
with this?

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.409
Well, if you look at the
description, for instance,

00:31:41.409 --> 00:31:44.388
of Zooey's face,
there's a beautiful description

00:31:44.388 --> 00:31:47.954
of how his face is beautiful,
in what way his face is

00:31:47.954 --> 00:31:51.318
beautiful.
We know that Franny is an

00:31:51.318 --> 00:31:56.063
attractive young woman.
We know that she worries about

00:31:56.063 --> 00:31:58.549
beauty, and especially in
poetry.

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:01.394
When she's trying to explain
what's wrong,

00:32:01.394 --> 00:32:05.349
part of what's wrong is that
when she learns poetry in the

00:32:05.349 --> 00:32:08.680
classroom none of it seems
beautiful to her;

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:12.283
it all seems like some other
kind of production,

00:32:12.283 --> 00:32:15.931
not the production of beauty.
So prettiness,

00:32:15.931 --> 00:32:21.562
beauty, the aesthetic is at the
heart of the spiritual practice

00:32:21.562 --> 00:32:26.557
that Zooey is urging upon
Franny, the spiritual practice

00:32:26.557 --> 00:32:30.266
of acting.
And I would remind you,

00:32:30.266 --> 00:32:35.220
looking back to that passage on
page 65 and into the 66,

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:40.690
that specifically among the
figures that Buddy mentions,

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:44.370
the religious and literary
figures,

00:32:44.370 --> 00:32:49.070
we find Shakespeare.
And I think Shakespeare in this

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:54.760
train of figures represents the
literary that is also the

00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:58.636
dramatic.
So, in our tradition

00:32:58.636 --> 00:33:05.410
Shakespeare is the literary name
above all others.

00:33:05.410 --> 00:33:10.775
It's important for Salinger
that Shakespeare was a

00:33:10.775 --> 00:33:14.486
dramatist.
It's important for this novel

00:33:14.486 --> 00:33:18.534
that Shakespeare was a
dramatist, not just because

00:33:18.534 --> 00:33:23.409
Zooey wants Franny to inhabit
acting fully as her desire and

00:33:23.409 --> 00:33:27.953
as her religious practice as
opposed to saying the Jesus

00:33:27.953 --> 00:33:30.782
prayer.
Acting has a deeper relation to

00:33:30.782 --> 00:33:33.858
the novel and here's where we
get back to that question of

00:33:33.858 --> 00:33:36.609
being in closed spaces and the
lack of movement.

00:33:36.609 --> 00:33:39.861
If you think about this
novel, it has the structures of

00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:42.849
drama.
It takes place in small rooms.

00:33:42.849 --> 00:33:48.389
If you begin to think about it,
you can almost see the set

00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:52.859
changes: in the diner,
on the train station.

00:33:52.859 --> 00:33:56.000
That's about the most open
place, on the train platform.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.440
That's about the most open
place we see.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.798
In the diner,
in the apartment:

00:34:01.798 --> 00:34:06.750
all you do in the apartment is
move from one room to another.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:10.787
These are dramatic spaces.
Moreover, the bathroom:

00:34:10.787 --> 00:34:17.114
completely a dramatic space.
It even has a curtain hiding

00:34:17.114 --> 00:34:23.732
Zooey from his mother.
Acting becomes a religious

00:34:23.732 --> 00:34:31.634
practice for much more than
Franny, not just for Franny and

00:34:31.634 --> 00:34:37.219
for Zooey 'cause Zooey's an
actor too.

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:43.039
It's a religious practice for
the novel itself.

00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:47.538
And that, I would suggest to
you, is where we can begin to

00:34:47.538 --> 00:34:51.641
bring some of those obvious
things: the prevalence of

00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:54.624
dialog,
those enclosed spaces,

00:34:54.624 --> 00:34:59.812
the tone, the exaggerated tone,
the somewhat histrionic

00:34:59.812 --> 00:35:03.057
quality,
the combativeness of that

00:35:03.057 --> 00:35:05.770
conversation,
its sheer style.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:10.909
These are great talkers!
But, I would suggest to

00:35:10.909 --> 00:35:13.860
you, Salinger is trying to
balance something very

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:16.402
carefully,
that relates back to this

00:35:16.402 --> 00:35:20.166
question of doctrine versus
syncretism in the religious

00:35:20.166 --> 00:35:23.493
sphere of the novel,
in the religious thematic

00:35:23.493 --> 00:35:26.156
material of the novel.
And, for this,

00:35:26.156 --> 00:35:29.770
I'd like to look at the very
end of the novel.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:41.565
Zooey finally suggests that
it's attention to the audience

00:35:41.565 --> 00:35:46.889
that makes an actor really a
special actor,

00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:52.432
a religious actor,
and he points back to advice

00:35:52.432 --> 00:35:56.650
that Buddy gave him
about--sorry,

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.385
that Seymour had given
him--about performing on a radio

00:36:00.385 --> 00:36:04.101
show.
So, they were all radio show

00:36:04.101 --> 00:36:11.142
whiz kids, and one day Zooey had
not wanted to shine his shoes

00:36:11.142 --> 00:36:15.760
and says--this is on page
200--that:

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.503
"The announcer was a
moron, the studio audience were

00:36:18.503 --> 00:36:20.380
all morons, the sponsors were
morons,

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.669
and I just damn well wasn't
going to shine my shoes for

00:36:23.669 --> 00:36:26.282
them, I told Seymour.
I said they couldn't see them

00:36:26.282 --> 00:36:29.230
anyway where we sat.
He said to shine them anyway.

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.690
He said to shine them for the
Fat Lady."

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:35.823
Now, why the Fat Lady?
It's this mythical,

00:36:35.823 --> 00:36:41.197
incredibly humanly embodied--
whenever you see a fat lady in a

00:36:41.197 --> 00:36:44.035
novel,
one of the first things you

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:47.521
want to ask is:
why does that person need to be

00:36:47.521 --> 00:36:51.076
excessively embodied?
That's what fatness is in a

00:36:51.076 --> 00:36:54.573
novel like this.
It's excessive embodiment,

00:36:54.573 --> 00:36:56.782
the human.
That's what this woman

00:36:56.782 --> 00:37:00.830
represents, the human.
Connect to the human audience;

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:06.820
respect the human audience.
Act for them, to them.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.623
Don't act as if they are just
some bunch of Philistines out

00:37:11.623 --> 00:37:14.770
there who can't appreciate your
art.

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:22.014
And then he says to Franny: 
"I'll tell you a terrible

00:37:22.014 --> 00:37:23.719
secret.
Are you listening to me?

00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:28.869
There isn't anyone out there
who isn't Seymour's Fat Lady.

00:37:28.869 --> 00:37:31.751
That includes your Professor
Tupper, buddy,

00:37:31.751 --> 00:37:34.769
and all his goddamn cousins by
the dozens.

00:37:34.769 --> 00:37:38.950
There isn't anyone anywhere who
isn't Seymour's Fat Lady.

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.219
Don't you know that?
Don't you know that goddamn

00:37:42.219 --> 00:37:44.954
secret yet?
And don't you know--Listen to

00:37:44.954 --> 00:37:48.379
me, now.
Don't you know who the Fat Lady

00:37:48.379 --> 00:37:50.710
really is?
Ah, buddy.

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:54.963
Ah, buddy, it's Christ Himself,
Christ Himself,

00:37:54.963 --> 00:37:57.849
buddy."
This seems like a completely

00:37:57.849 --> 00:38:00.901
Christian answer to Zooey's
problem, and we're back on the

00:38:00.901 --> 00:38:04.656
horns of that dilemma.
Is this a syncretic religious

00:38:04.656 --> 00:38:07.490
vision, or is it a Christian
one?

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:11.989
But look what follows.
This is not the last word.

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:14.297
For joy,
apparently, it was all Franny

00:38:14.297 --> 00:38:16.980
could do to hold the phone even
with both hands.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:20.059
For a foolish half minute or so
there was no other words,

00:38:20.059 --> 00:38:22.534
no further speech,
then "I can't talk anymore,

00:38:22.534 --> 00:38:24.605
buddy."
The sound of a phone being

00:38:24.605 --> 00:38:28.506
replaced on its catch followed.
Franny took in her breath

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:32.949
slightly but continued to hold
the phone to her ear.

00:38:32.949 --> 00:38:36.812
A dial tone of course followed
the formal break in the

00:38:36.812 --> 00:38:39.735
connection.
She appeared to find it

00:38:39.735 --> 00:38:44.804
extraordinarily beautiful to
listen to, rather as if it were

00:38:44.804 --> 00:38:49.443
the best possible substitute for
the primordial silence

00:38:49.443 --> 00:38:53.497
itself.
The dial tone is that state of

00:38:53.497 --> 00:38:58.262
awareness of the divine that
Buddy speaks of when he says-

00:38:58.262 --> 00:39:02.610
when he speaks of being with God
before God said,

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.413
"Let there be light."
Zooey's voice breaking that

00:39:06.413 --> 00:39:09.906
dial tone in the beginning in
his phone call,

00:39:09.906 --> 00:39:13.400
and then the resumption of it
afterwards,

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:18.006
that dial tone encases Zooey's
voice, so that what Zooey says

00:39:18.006 --> 00:39:22.230
to her is one of the rays of
light of God's creation,

00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:24.937
one of those things,
like Shakespeare,

00:39:24.937 --> 00:39:28.010
that is part of the whole
created world,

00:39:28.010 --> 00:39:32.840
but what Franny can tune into,
after hearing his voice,

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.240
is that very essential divine
sound,

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:43.316
meaningless sound.
And so, this is how Salinger

00:39:43.316 --> 00:39:48.590
balances the syncretic,
the sort of empty mysticism of

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:52.417
Seymour and Buddy,
with the embodied,

00:39:52.417 --> 00:39:57.533
doctrinal, specific insistence
that we see from Zooey,

00:39:57.533 --> 00:40:01.780
from the insistence on human
specificity,

00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:07.549
the Fat Lady,
the very material human fleshly

00:40:07.549 --> 00:40:11.903
person.
Salinger's own novel performs

00:40:11.903 --> 00:40:18.031
in this way, and that's how you
would want to think about

00:40:18.031 --> 00:40:22.080
moments like on the bottom of
180.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:32.340
This is describing the bedroom
of Seymour and Buddy as Zooey

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.352
walks in.
A stranger with a flair

00:40:35.352 --> 00:40:39.227
for cocktail party descriptive
prose might have commented that

00:40:39.227 --> 00:40:41.022
the room,
at a quick glance,

00:40:41.022 --> 00:40:44.178
looked as if it had once been
tenanted by two struggling

00:40:44.178 --> 00:40:46.989
twelve-year-old lawyers or
researchists.

00:40:46.989 --> 00:40:54.464
And then if you flip back
to--let's see--172 describing

00:40:54.464 --> 00:40:59.446
Zooey's sweaty shirt,
"His shirt was,

00:40:59.446 --> 00:41:05.260
in the familiar phrase,
wringing wet."

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:08.862
And there are lots of moments
like this, self-conscious

00:41:08.862 --> 00:41:11.548
moments of style.
So, "in the familiar phrase,

00:41:11.548 --> 00:41:13.979
'wringing wet,'" he's saying,
"I'm about to use a

00:41:13.979 --> 00:41:17.010
cliché.
Here it is. There it is."

00:41:17.010 --> 00:41:22.349
He says someone with a flair
for cocktail party conversation,

00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:25.019
a witticism,
would say this.

00:41:25.019 --> 00:41:28.759
He gives it to us,
but he frames it as an

00:41:28.759 --> 00:41:32.733
affectation of style.
So, what Salinger,

00:41:32.733 --> 00:41:38.303
I think, shows us is that
affectation, without something

00:41:38.303 --> 00:41:43.469
like love, is just affectation,
and that's what Lane

00:41:43.469 --> 00:41:46.673
represents.
That's the affectation of

00:41:46.673 --> 00:41:49.269
literature without any human
connection.

00:41:49.269 --> 00:41:52.670
That's why when he talks on and
on, it's as if Franny isn't even

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:56.334
there listening to him.
He's been going on a quarter

00:41:56.334 --> 00:41:59.639
hour, and he's just hitting his
stride.

00:41:59.639 --> 00:42:04.582
Franny, Zooey,
Buddy, Bessie:

00:42:04.582 --> 00:42:12.880
they all try to speak directly
to each other.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:18.849
The family language is what
makes them very human;

00:42:18.849 --> 00:42:23.473
they embody this very specific
family language.And so,

00:42:23.473 --> 00:42:28.015
I would argue to you that
Salinger imagines literature as

00:42:28.015 --> 00:42:33.117
a performance of this kind,
a performance of a language of

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:38.380
family love that is nevertheless
also an aesthetic language.

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:42.431
And I think,
actually, probably the best

00:42:42.431 --> 00:42:46.380
image of that is in Seymour's
diary.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.373
When Zooey sits down to make
that phone call,

00:42:49.373 --> 00:42:53.659
he opens up Seymour's diary and
he sees Seymour's account of his

00:42:53.659 --> 00:42:57.576
birthday celebration,
where the family had put on a

00:42:57.576 --> 00:43:00.940
vaudeville show right in their
living room.

00:43:00.940 --> 00:43:05.230
Remember, his parents are
vaudevillians.

00:43:05.230 --> 00:43:09.276
And that description,
which I won't read just because

00:43:09.276 --> 00:43:13.090
we're running out of time,
it's on 181 and 182.

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:19.280
You can look at it yourself.
It's brimming with pleasure and

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.996
love.
This is why Buddy really can't

00:43:23.996 --> 00:43:31.969
insist that Zooey is wrong about
this being a religious novel,

00:43:31.969 --> 00:43:37.543
because being a religious novel
and being a love story are

00:43:37.543 --> 00:43:41.260
finally for Salinger the same
thing.

00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:46.780
It's the performance of human
connection.

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.310
That's the phone line;
that's conversation;

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:53.741
that's letters.
The performance of family

00:43:53.741 --> 00:43:57.743
conversation is like acting,
and that is why Zooey

00:43:57.743 --> 00:44:02.210
impersonates Buddy;
he's acting.

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:05.253
But Franny can hear the
specific voice,

00:44:05.253 --> 00:44:09.898
and this is when you know that
Franny is not just a sort of

00:44:09.898 --> 00:44:13.706
empty air head.
She may be mistaken about who

00:44:13.706 --> 00:44:18.438
she's praying to in the Jesus
prayer, but she damn well knows

00:44:18.438 --> 00:44:22.933
the timbre of her brother's
voice and his particularity of

00:44:22.933 --> 00:44:25.374
speech.
And so, when he tries to

00:44:25.374 --> 00:44:28.300
imitate Buddy,
she finds him out very quickly.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:33.139
And this is when you know that
Franny really does benefit from

00:44:33.139 --> 00:44:37.819
Seymour and Buddy's religious
education in the same way that

00:44:37.819 --> 00:44:41.105
Zooey has.
And so, if we step back for

00:44:41.105 --> 00:44:45.247
a minute now from my reading,
there are a couple of things I

00:44:45.247 --> 00:44:47.493
want to say.
First of all,

00:44:47.493 --> 00:44:51.255
I hope you can see,
using that as a model,

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:56.578
how I went from big claims
about the novel into specificity

00:44:56.578 --> 00:45:01.940
to support those claims.
That's the structure of any

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:06.736
good literary argument.
The attention moves from the

00:45:06.736 --> 00:45:10.159
very small to the large and back
again.

00:45:10.159 --> 00:45:13.888
There is a kind of rhythm to
that, that folds in those

00:45:13.888 --> 00:45:18.389
obvious parts of the novel to a
more thematic set of concerns,

00:45:18.389 --> 00:45:23.234
in this case about the
religious philosophy of this

00:45:23.234 --> 00:45:26.170
novel.
So, as you think about writing

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:30.561
papers, go through that two-step
process of thinking about the

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:34.882
large picture of what a novel is
doing as a piece of literary

00:45:34.882 --> 00:45:37.375
art,
and then thinking about a

00:45:37.375 --> 00:45:41.389
focused set of concerns.
And, in the final development

00:45:41.389 --> 00:45:44.680
of your paper,
making sure that those two can

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.348
relate to one another.
The second thing I want to say

00:45:48.348 --> 00:45:51.764
is less about paper writing,
and more about the trajectory

00:45:51.764 --> 00:45:55.300
of this course and what we're
seeing in common between these

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:58.080
novels.
So, you can read this very

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:03.964
closely to On the Road.
If Dean cared for "nothing

00:46:03.964 --> 00:46:10.079
but for everything in
principle," you could say,

00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:16.626
conversely, that Salinger cares
for everything in particular,

00:46:16.626 --> 00:46:21.289
and in principle,
nothingness.

00:46:21.289 --> 00:46:27.640
It's nothingness that is the
mystical state rather than

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.507
everythingness.
And it's interesting to think

00:46:31.507 --> 00:46:34.469
about whether those two are
really opposites.

00:46:34.469 --> 00:46:38.802
I think these novels imagined
them to be opposites,

00:46:38.802 --> 00:46:44.000
but it's something for you to
think about, about whether they

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.603
really are.
So, Zooey's specificity is the

00:46:47.603 --> 00:46:51.671
specificity of doctrine,
but it's also the specificity

00:46:51.671 --> 00:46:55.510
and more importantly the
specificity of person.

00:46:55.510 --> 00:47:01.030
So that's the everything that
he cares about,

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.238
person.
I will stop there,

00:47:03.238 --> 00:47:07.012
and please bring both On the
Road and Franny and Zooey

00:47:07.012 --> 00:47:09.902
to section this week.
And, by the way,

00:47:09.902 --> 00:47:13.159
one last thing:
If you've been sketchy about

00:47:13.159 --> 00:47:17.250
your section attendance,
I suggest that you try to pull

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:22.346
up your socks and go.
We will be talking about papers

00:47:22.346 --> 00:47:25.387
in the section.
It will be helpful to you,

00:47:25.387 --> 00:47:28.297
and it will also give you a
chance to talk about these

00:47:28.297 --> 00:47:29.897
books, so please do go.

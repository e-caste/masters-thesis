00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:04.000
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So we're
studying nucleophilic 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.700
substitution, in part at least,
as a means of seeing 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.633
how one goes about establishing
a mechanism, 

00:00:12.633 --> 00:00:13.900
proving a mechanism. 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.900
Remember that the SN2
nucleophilic substitution has 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.667
a number of components here, and
the logic is to vary them, 

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:30.400
see how the rate changes, and
see if you can disprove some 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.267
of the mechanisms. And last time
we looked at kinetic 

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:40.733
order and at stereochemistry,
and began looking at how the 

00:00:40.733 --> 00:00:44.767
different components influence
the rate constant. 

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:48.933
So at the end of last time we
looked at the nucleophile, and 

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.500
saw that it was unusual. 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.900
The reactivity with a carbon in
the SN2 transition state 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.733
didn't seem to parallel the
reactivity with the proton. 

00:01:00.733 --> 00:01:03.300
If you went across the first row
it was fine, but when you 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.900
went down it looked funny. 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.900
But then we saw that the solvent
had 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.900
something to do with it. 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.133
That although in water it looks
funny, it's backwards 

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:12.600
from what you would expect. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.733
In acetone it's sensible. 

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.200
So we concluded that the solvent
makes a difference. 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.900
The solvent hydrogen-bonds in
the case of water to the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.400
nucleophile, making it less
reactive. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.767
The smaller, the more reactive
the nucleophile, the more it 

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:30.633
deactivates it. 

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:32.600
The stronger the hydrogen
bonding. 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.933
And you don't have that factor
in acetone. 

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:37.367
But that's just one example of a
solvent effect. 

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:40.933
There's a very general kind of
solvent effect where a polar 

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:44.100
solvent stabilizes ions. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.367
We saw this in the case of
water, the gas phase ions, how 

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:51.433
much they were stabilized by
having water come around them 

00:01:51.433 --> 00:01:54.700
to the order of 100 kilocalories
per mole, 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.867
compared to the gas phase. 

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:03.733
So whenever you generate ions,
or increase the localization 

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:08.500
of charge, you get stronger
bonding with polar solvents. 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.433
So polar solvents accelerate
reactions that generate or 

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:16.133
concentrate charge, because they
bind more strongly to it, 

00:02:16.133 --> 00:02:17.600
and vice versa. 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.433
If charge is being destroyed in
the reaction, than a polar 

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:24.633
solvent will stabilize the
starting materials more than 

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.233
it does the transition state,
and the 

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:27.933
reaction will slow down. 

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:32.300
So that's an important
consideration in choosing a 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.367
solvent for a reaction. 

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:37.300
Now let's look at the leaving
group. 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.267
Fortunately here things make
sense. 

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:45.733
You notice that the stronger the
acid, that is the more 

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:54.933
weakly that the particular group
bonds to a proton, the 

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:57.067
better it is as a leaving group.

00:02:57.067 --> 00:03:00.867
That is it can give up its bond
to carbon, the same way 

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:02.800
it gives up its bond to protons.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.867
And there's a strict
parallel between how

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:06.100
good a nucleophile
[correction: leaving group]

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.267
is and how acidic and what
its pKa is.

00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:13.400
So weak bases are good leaving
groups. 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.100
That is, stable anions form
easily. 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.300
Or, those that don't hold
tightly to H+, don't hold 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.333
tightly to the carbon in the
transition 

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:25.600
state of the SN2 reaction. 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.867
So that makes perfect sense. 

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:32.800
We looked last time at the work
of Bartlett and Knox, 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.000
this classic work of using a
bridgehead reactivity, this 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.900
bridgehead chloride, in order to
test some possibilities 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.967
about the mechanism of
nucleophilic substitution. 

00:03:45.967 --> 00:03:50.400
You can't get at the backside,
so that's out. 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.733
You can't form a double bond at
the bridgehead, so you 

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:55.967
don't have to worry about
elimination. 

00:03:58.567 --> 00:04:01.800
The question is whether you can
have a nonplanar cation, 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.500
or whether you could attack from
the front, instead of 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.200
from the back. 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.600
And by showing that this
compound was inert to such 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:14.033
substitutions, they were able to
show that those inferences 

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:15.300
were correct. 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.733
So they specifically designed
and prepared this molecule to 

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:21.800
test these mechanistic
questions. 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.900
Incidentally, since last time I
got hold of this picture of 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.667
Lawrence Knox. 

00:04:25.667 --> 00:04:28.500
It's his graduation picture from
Bates College. 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.467
Now he had to prepare the
molecule. 

00:04:34.467 --> 00:04:36.400
How did he prepare it? 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.667
Because what we're saying is
it's very difficult to prepare 

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:43.800
things at the bridgehead,
because you can't do 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.333
nucleophilic substitution. 

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.367
That's what their experiment
showed. 

00:04:47.367 --> 00:04:50.867
So how did they do it? 

00:04:50.867 --> 00:04:52.867
Well they started with this
amine. 

00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:55.933
Actually, they started with a
product that already had the 

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:58.733
carboxylate group in there. 

00:04:58.733 --> 00:05:01.933
And they converted that to the
amine by a reaction we'll 

00:05:01.933 --> 00:05:08.167
discuss later in the last
quarter of the semester. 

00:05:08.167 --> 00:05:10.600
But they had this compound
available. 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.967
How do they replace NH2 by Cl? 

00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:18.267
NH2 is a crummy leaving group,
and even a better leaving 

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:22.700
group like chloride, what they
showed was that it doesn't 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.933
undergo substitutions. 

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:29.000
So how do you put chloride in
place of the NH2? 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.667
You need some fabulous leaving
group if you want to be able 

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:36.067
to do something at the
bridgehead. 

00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:39.300
So what they did was treat the
amine -- 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.067
notice that the amine itself is
not a leaving group. 

00:05:42.067 --> 00:05:44.233
The pKa is 34. 

00:05:44.233 --> 00:05:47.267
So the higher the pKa, the worse
it is as a leaving group, 

00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:49.767
as we just saw. 

00:05:49.767 --> 00:05:53.133
If you protonated it, it would
make it a much better leaving 

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:58.033
group because protonated NH3 the
ammonium ion has a pKa 

00:05:58.033 --> 00:06:02.367
that's 25 powers of ten better.

00:06:02.367 --> 00:06:04.967
But still, that's not nearly
good enough to make a 

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:07.700
bridgehead cation in order to do
substitution at the 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.867
bridgehead. 

00:06:09.867 --> 00:06:12.900
So what they did was treat the
amine with NOCl. 

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:17.533
Now let's think about how those
would 

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:19.367
react with one another. 

00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:23.133
What makes the NH2 reactive? 

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.267
Antonia, what do you say? 

00:06:24.267 --> 00:06:25.167
STUDENT: The high HOMO? 

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:28.067
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: And the high
HOMO is-- 

00:06:28.067 --> 00:06:29.033
STUDENT: The lone pair on the
nitrogen. 

00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:31.733
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Right, the
lone pair on the nitrogen. 

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:32.733
So what's it going to attack? 

00:06:32.733 --> 00:06:33.967
Antonia, keep us going. 

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:37.467
STUDENT: The N-O pi-star. 

00:06:37.467 --> 00:06:41.667
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: OK, there's a
pi-star bond of N-O. So it 

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:43.300
could form a bond to nitrogen. 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.000
But, if you have that negative
charge on the oxygen-- 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.033
that's perfectly good, and it's
almost 

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:49.200
certainly the way it starts. 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.467
But that negative charge can
come back in, reform the bond, 

00:06:53.467 --> 00:06:57.500
and lose chloride, which is a
good leaving group. 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.200
So I'm not going to draw the
intermediate step, which is 

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.967
probably correct, that you
suggested. 

00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:04.600
But just say that it displaces
the chloride. 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.333
It probably is because of the
pi-star 

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.633
that does it so easily. 

00:07:07.633 --> 00:07:10.967
Although it could do it
directly. 

00:07:10.967 --> 00:07:14.133
So then we're going to have
chloride displaced and a 

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:16.533
positive charge on this
nitrogen. 

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:18.700
What will happen next? 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:22.000
How do you get rid of positive
charges on nitrogen like that? 

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:29.200
Po-Yi? 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.367
We have an ion. 

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:34.400
Generally there are other things
around that are better 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.100
at having positive charge than
this. 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.300
Can you think of some way you
can get rid of 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.567
that positive charge? 

00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:47.233
What did we just say about
protonated nitrogen? 

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:48.600
Remember? 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.967
Remember its pKa is nine. 

00:07:50.967 --> 00:07:57.300
It's 25 powers of 10 better as a
leaving group-- 

00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.600
that is to give up a proton-- 

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:04.800
than NH3 is to give up a proton
and form NH2 minus. 

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.800
Much better to have NH3 as the
leaving group-- 

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.633
trivalent nitrogen-- 

00:08:09.633 --> 00:08:11.333
rather than the anion. 

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:13.167
So it's acidic. 

00:08:13.167 --> 00:08:14.400
It gives up a proton. 

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.200
The next thing you need to do to
get toward the product-- 

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.600
I mean obviously this particular
reaction wasn't 

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.533
figured out on paper by saying
what's the HOMO and what's the 

00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:27.367
LUMO, and so on. 

00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:29.400
They mixed it and found out what
happened. 

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.800
But we can predict what's going
to happen. 

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:35.733
But fortunately I have some
insight into what does happen, 

00:08:35.733 --> 00:08:37.900
so I know what has to happen
next. 

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.200
What you have to do is have
what's called an allylic 

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.733
rearrangement, where are you
shift the double bond and the 

00:08:44.733 --> 00:08:49.167
H, so the H goes from N to O.
The double bond goes between 

00:08:49.167 --> 00:08:50.633
the two Ns. 

00:08:50.633 --> 00:08:55.733
From one end to the other, of a
three atom allylic system. 

00:08:55.733 --> 00:08:57.333
How do we go about that? 

00:08:57.333 --> 00:08:59.367
Well first we can put the proton
on that 

00:08:59.367 --> 00:09:00.700
shared pair of oxygen. 

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.200
That's pretty easy. 

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.267
And now there's a resonance
structure of that involving 

00:09:06.267 --> 00:09:09.167
the unshared pair on nitrogen
again. 

00:09:09.167 --> 00:09:16.000
So we can go in, and the pi
electrons can go on to oxygen 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.867
in the resonance structure we're
talking about. 

00:09:18.867 --> 00:09:22.500
So now we've done the allylic
rearrangement, except it's 

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.033
still got a positive charge on
the nitrogen. 

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:27.767
Po-Yi, what do you do now? 

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:29.767
To get rid of the positive
charge on the nitrogen? 

00:09:29.767 --> 00:09:32.067
STUDENT: The proton leaves? 

00:09:32.067 --> 00:09:32.500
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Right. 

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:33.767
You lose the proton again. 

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:39.333
Now you do the same thing again.

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:40.500
Watch this. 

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:44.500
So you protonate the water. 

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:48.400
And now use the unshared pair of
the nitrogen. 

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.733
And we're going to draw two
arrows. 

00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:56.467
So you form a triple bond
between the two nitrogens, and 

00:09:56.467 --> 00:09:58.133
water is the good leaving group.

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:02.533
So we have that. 

00:10:02.533 --> 00:10:06.500
And now that truly is a fabulous
leaving group. 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.667
What is the leaving group? 

00:10:07.667 --> 00:10:08.900
What's going to leave? 

00:10:14.533 --> 00:10:14.967
Ruoyi? 

00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:15.867
STUDENT: Nitrogen. 

00:10:15.867 --> 00:10:18.100
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: N2. 

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.567
I looked. 

00:10:19.567 --> 00:10:24.367
I couldn't find a pKa for
protonated N2. 

00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:29.500
It just has no affinity for a
proton on at all. 

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:30.900
I couldn't find it. 

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.467
But it's certainly a very, very
strong acid. 

00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:37.433
Protonated nitrogen gas. 

00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:40.400
So it's a very good leaving
group. 

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.800
And you get N2, and it as a
leaving group can generate 

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.400
even a bridgehead cation, the
thing that you 

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.733
can't do with chloride. 

00:10:48.733 --> 00:10:51.033
Even with the help of silver ion
as 

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:54.167
Bartlett and Knox found. 

00:10:54.167 --> 00:10:56.067
So once you have that, remember
we already got the 

00:10:56.067 --> 00:10:58.033
chloride from the first
reaction. 

00:10:58.033 --> 00:11:01.767
So you just put that in, and
that's how they made it. 

00:11:01.767 --> 00:11:04.900
So there are leaving groups even
better than these. 

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.800
N2 is a fabulous leaving group,
and can even make the 

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.167
bridgehead cation. 

00:11:12.167 --> 00:11:16.933
Now this idea of protonating or
charging things in order that 

00:11:16.933 --> 00:11:20.833
they leave as neutral molecules
like N2, is also 

00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:25.067
present in molecules in the list
we already have here. 

00:11:25.067 --> 00:11:26.867
Like ROH. 

00:11:26.867 --> 00:11:31.167
That's a very bad leaving group,
OH minus. 

00:11:31.167 --> 00:11:36.033
However, if you protonate it,
then you have water as the 

00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:37.533
leaving group and that's good. 

00:11:37.533 --> 00:11:45.933
You've changed the pKa by 17.5
powers of 10. 

00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:49.500
You've changed the pKa by 17.5
units. 

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.467
That is the equilibrium constant
by that 

00:11:51.467 --> 00:11:52.900
many powers of 10. 

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:54.733
So that becomes very good. 

00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:57.633
And in fact there's another good
way of doing it. 

00:11:57.633 --> 00:12:01.667
So that's acid catalysis to help
lose OH, that is you lose 

00:12:01.667 --> 00:12:04.700
it as water not as OH minus. 

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.233
And another way is to convert it
into a sulfonate ester, 

00:12:08.233 --> 00:12:09.633
which is a good leaving group. 

00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:12.033
Did you ever see that before? 

00:12:12.033 --> 00:12:14.867
To have that complicated thing
leave instead of OH minus? 

00:12:19.733 --> 00:12:22.467
Because of the new dispensation
that the exam is 

00:12:22.467 --> 00:12:25.300
going to be on Friday rather
than Wednesday, you have a 

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.733
whole week to learn that. 

00:12:29.267 --> 00:12:32.200
So that was what Kenyon and
Phillips did, remember, in 

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.867
order to study the inversion. 

00:12:35.867 --> 00:12:41.200
So there are leaving group
tricks, and there's lore about 

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:44.800
that, of what you could do to
help make OH a leaving group. 

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.633
You can protonate it and have
the leaving group be H2O. 

00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:51.733
So that could be the leaving
group, OH2+, and then it 

00:12:51.733 --> 00:12:54.167
leaves as H2O. 

00:12:54.167 --> 00:12:56.300
So we can look at an example of
that. 

00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.067
So here's bromide going to
displace hydroxide. 

00:13:00.067 --> 00:13:04.867
So we can imagine it coming on,
and hydroxide going off. 

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:06.500
But there's a problem with this.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:11.567
The pKa of water is 16, roughly.

00:13:11.567 --> 00:13:16.200
And the pKa of HBr is -5. 

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.133
So one way to say it is that
bromide is a much better anion 

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:22.967
than hydroxide is. 

00:13:22.967 --> 00:13:26.100
When one of them is going to be
protonated. 

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:28.567
What does that mean about this
reaction? 

00:13:28.567 --> 00:13:30.667
That you'd rather have bromide
than have hydroxide. 

00:13:33.967 --> 00:13:36.167
Luke, what does that say about
this reaction? 

00:13:36.167 --> 00:13:37.800
Going to make a lot of money
doing that reaction? 

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.767
STUDENT: Probably not. 

00:13:40.767 --> 00:13:41.967
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Why not? 

00:13:41.967 --> 00:13:45.367
STUDENT: Well, that probably
wouldn't happen. 

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:46.333
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: I can't hear
very well. 

00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:47.333
STUDENT: That probably wouldn't
happen. 

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:49.167
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: What would
happen? 

00:13:49.167 --> 00:13:50.133
STUDENT: The-- 

00:13:50.133 --> 00:13:53.933
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: You'd go the
other direction. 

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:56.600
So it would go that way. 

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.800
And so you'd start with an
expensive starting material 

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.800
and make cheap product if you
want to use that reaction. 

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:07.033
But if you put HBr in there. 

00:14:07.033 --> 00:14:12.967
You protonate it, because HBr
has a pKa of 5 

00:14:12.967 --> 00:14:13.700
[correction: -5]. 

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:20.900
But water or alcohol, has a pKa
of -1.7. 

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.433
So there's a difference between
that of over three. 

00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:29.533
So it's more than a thousand
times better to protonate the 

00:14:29.533 --> 00:14:33.167
oxygen, than it is to protonate
Br-. 

00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:34.700
So this reaction will certainly
go 

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.900
in the right direction. 

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.133
And now you have a great leaving
group. 

00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:42.433
So bromide is a good nucleophile
and 

00:14:42.433 --> 00:14:44.000
will displace water. 

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.600
So if you just tried using
sodium bromide as the source 

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.400
of bromide, it wouldn't work. 

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.800
But if you use hydrobromic acid,
then you zip up the 

00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:00.700
starting material and now it's
downhill to the product. 

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:02.600
And you can cleave ethers. 

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.600
You know ether is a common
solvent. 

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.033
I suspect you've used ether in
lab. 

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:10.700
Because it doesn't react well
with-- 

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.600
you can have lots of
nucleophiles in there, but you 

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.867
don't displace OR minus. 

00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:19.300
That's not a good leaving group.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:21.600
It's like OH minus. 

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:27.033
But if you use HBr like this
example here, excess 47% HBr, 

00:15:27.033 --> 00:15:28.500
treated for eight hours. 

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.033
It protonates. 

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:32.267
And now you have a good leaving
group. 

00:15:32.267 --> 00:15:34.500
So you have a good nucleophile,
and a good 

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.533
leaving group. 

00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:39.467
The bromide can attack the
carbon, and the alcohol is the 

00:15:39.467 --> 00:15:42.400
leaving group. 

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:46.133
And then we already saw that the
alcohol reacts with HBr to 

00:15:46.133 --> 00:15:46.967
give bromide. 

00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:50.133
So you convert the ether
completely to the bromide if 

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:51.133
you add HBr. 

00:15:51.133 --> 00:15:55.133
So HBr can cleave ethers. 

00:15:55.133 --> 00:16:00.200
So that's one trick to make OH-
into a leaving group. 

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:04.333
To make OH into OH2+. 

00:16:04.333 --> 00:16:07.000
Another one is the one we
already alluded to and talked 

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.200
about last time. 

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.533
Which is to convert the alcohol
into what's called a 

00:16:12.533 --> 00:16:13.433
sulfonate ester. 

00:16:13.433 --> 00:16:15.167
A tosylate. 

00:16:15.167 --> 00:16:18.500
The reason it's called tosylate,
is that acid is 

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.267
called toluenesulfonic acid. 

00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:24.400
So it's abbreviated tosic acid.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.967
So tosylate is the leaving
group. 

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:31.467
The pKa of that acid is -3. 

00:16:31.467 --> 00:16:33.633
So it's not surprising it's a
good leaving group. 

00:16:33.633 --> 00:16:36.933
It worked well for Kenyon and
Phillips in 1923. 

00:16:36.933 --> 00:16:39.500
That's a very common way to make
alcohols 

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.533
into leaving groups. 

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:45.167
Another way is talked about in
the Jones 

00:16:45.167 --> 00:16:47.800
text, which is OSOCl. 

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.333
So the way to get that is to
start, as they say here,

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:55.000
with thionyl chloride,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.267
SOCl2, which reacts with the
alcohol, to give an alkyl 

00:17:00.267 --> 00:17:03.600
chloride plus SO2 and HCl. 

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.467
And there's an example shown
here of a particular acid 

00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:10.033
being converted with thionyl
chloride, chloroform, 100 

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:13.567
degrees, two hours, into an 80%
yield, they say of this, 

00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:15.767
plus SO2 and HCl. 

00:17:15.767 --> 00:17:20.300
80% is not such a great yield
for this reaction. 

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.400
This is one of the reactions
I've done a lot, and it really 

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.300
gets very, very good yields
typically. 

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.833
One of the reasons it's so handy
is that the 

00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:31.633
byproducts are gases. 

00:17:31.633 --> 00:17:34.367
So you don't have to do any
separation, they just go away. 

00:17:34.367 --> 00:17:37.400
You can appreciate from lab how
handy it would be if you 

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.833
didn't have to do any
purification of the product at 

00:17:39.833 --> 00:17:43.833
the end, everything just went up
the hood. 

00:17:43.833 --> 00:17:49.567
And furthermore, there seems to
be a little bit of a 

00:17:49.567 --> 00:17:50.300
problem here. 

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.333
Because they said they did this
in chloroform at 

00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:53.567
100 degrees. 

00:17:53.567 --> 00:17:57.667
It could be that the bath was at
100 degrees, but if so the 

00:17:57.667 --> 00:17:59.933
solution wasn't at 100 degrees.

00:17:59.933 --> 00:18:02.067
Does anybody have an idea why
that might be? 

00:18:04.567 --> 00:18:07.200
Because the boiling point of
chloroform is 61, and the 

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:11.067
boiling point of thionyl
chloride is 75, so it'd be 

00:18:11.067 --> 00:18:14.367
very difficult to get a solution
like that heated to 

00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:16.267
100 degrees. 

00:18:16.267 --> 00:18:21.300
So the reason I point this out
on this page from the book, is 

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.300
that Professor Jones is a great
friend of mine, and a 

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.500
very good physical organic
chemist. And he's taken the 

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.167
care in his book, as in most
good books, to actually put in 

00:18:35.167 --> 00:18:38.800
real examples, not just
theoretical examples made up 

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.067
out of your head. 

00:18:40.067 --> 00:18:44.300
There was a very famous
professor in the in the first 

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:48.867
half of the twentieth century at
MIT whose occupation in the 

00:18:48.867 --> 00:18:51.633
summer was to write textbooks. 

00:18:51.633 --> 00:18:54.933
But he did it by going up to his
cabin in Maine, and 

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:56.733
writing the textbooks there,
where he had 

00:18:56.733 --> 00:18:58.833
no access to a library. 

00:18:58.833 --> 00:19:00.733
So everything he wrote, he made
up out 

00:19:00.733 --> 00:19:02.700
of his head in there. 

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.267
Much better to have an example
like this where they give 

00:19:05.267 --> 00:19:08.233
exactly what the yield is, 80%,
and what 

00:19:08.233 --> 00:19:09.400
the conditions were. 

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.333
But even in this case, I
doubt that that

00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:12.700
really was the condition.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:16.200
Although that might have been
what the heating mantle was, 

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.167
at a 100 degrees. 

00:19:17.167 --> 00:19:18.467
But the solution couldn't
possibly 

00:19:18.467 --> 00:19:20.200
have been at 100 degrees. 

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.367
Even though when you mix things
the boiling point is 

00:19:22.367 --> 00:19:24.100
elevated, but it wouldn't be
that much 

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:25.467
elevated I don't think. 

00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:29.300
But the reason I mention that is
not just to point out that 

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:32.200
you have to take things with a
grain of salt and look as much 

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.367
as you can at original
literature, if you really want 

00:19:35.367 --> 00:19:40.200
to repeat some process, but to
point out that thionyl 

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.300
chloride is not a very high
boiling liquid. 

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.867
So in fact all you do is take
the alcohol-- 

00:19:46.867 --> 00:19:50.767
You don't need chloroform, at
least I never used a solvent. 

00:19:50.767 --> 00:19:51.667
This is a liquid. 

00:19:51.667 --> 00:19:54.033
This'll dissolve this. 

00:19:54.033 --> 00:19:58.200
And the product chloride is a
liquid even with bigger 

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.000
molecules where the alcohol
might be a solid. 

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.433
So you just heat it up for a
while, reflux it, and then 

00:20:05.433 --> 00:20:06.633
distill out. 

00:20:06.633 --> 00:20:12.600
And this SOCl2 distills out, the
SO2 and HCl distills out, 

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.867
and all you're left with is the
alkyl chloride. 

00:20:15.867 --> 00:20:18.900
It's a beautiful reaction. 

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:23.133
OK and here's an example that
shows the mechanism of this. 

00:20:23.133 --> 00:20:25.200
The crucial part is this. 

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:29.000
The alcohol displaces at sulfur.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.300
So the chloride goes away, and
you get R-O, and this is the 

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:33.567
new bond, SOCl. 

00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:38.267
Oh pardon, me. 

00:20:38.267 --> 00:20:41.633
I said the wrong thing at first.
You displace one of 

00:20:41.633 --> 00:20:47.833
these chlorides with the O. So
you get ROSOCl. 

00:20:47.833 --> 00:20:51.667
But now the neat reaction is
that you generated chloride in 

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:54.167
that process, when you
eliminated a chloride here. 

00:20:54.167 --> 00:20:58.100
That chloride can do an SN2
displacement on the R. These 

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:03.300
electrons go in here, but at the
same time these electrons 

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.367
go on to the chloride. 

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:07.133
So you directly make SO2 and Cl.

00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:10.433
So it's an unusual kind of
leaving group, because it 

00:21:10.433 --> 00:21:12.033
breaks apart as it leaves. 

00:21:15.267 --> 00:21:21.267
Now another way to make the OH
into a leaving group, is to 

00:21:21.267 --> 00:21:24.267
have phosphorus on there with
electron 

00:21:24.267 --> 00:21:26.067
withdrawing groups on it. 

00:21:26.067 --> 00:21:29.433
Because as it turns out, the
double bond between phosphorus 

00:21:29.433 --> 00:21:31.800
and oxygen is quite a strong
one. 

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.367
Remember that phosphorus has d
orbitals that are vacant. 

00:21:35.367 --> 00:21:39.700
So they can stabilize the
electrons on the adjacent 

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.367
oxygen when you make a negative
charge there. 

00:21:43.367 --> 00:21:46.733
And if X is something that's
electronegative this is a very 

00:21:46.733 --> 00:21:48.067
good leaving group. 

00:21:48.067 --> 00:21:53.100
So here's an example of an
alcohol treated with PBr3 and 

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.600
it gives a 58% yield they said
here with specific conditions, 

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:02.400
and phosphoric acid is a
byproduct. 

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:08.067
And here's another example,
using PCl5. 

00:22:08.067 --> 00:22:10.300
It says 100%. 

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:15.500
Beware of things that say the
yield is 100%, that's a sign 

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.867
that the person probably wasn't
very careful. 

00:22:17.867 --> 00:22:21.267
Have you ever gotten 100% yield
in lab? 

00:22:21.267 --> 00:22:23.967
These people maybe have more
experience than you, but 

00:22:23.967 --> 00:22:25.533
they're not that much better. 

00:22:25.533 --> 00:22:31.100
Very rarely do you truly get
100% yield. 

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.333
Now how does this work? 

00:22:32.333 --> 00:22:35.067
Well, first you do a
substitution at phosphorus. 

00:22:35.067 --> 00:22:38.533
So the O of the OH, attacks
phosphorus 

00:22:38.533 --> 00:22:40.033
and displaces chloride. 

00:22:40.033 --> 00:22:44.500
Probably that's A/D, association
and dissociation. 

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:47.333
Probably you first form a bond
to phosphorus, remember it has 

00:22:47.333 --> 00:22:52.100
vacant d orbitals, and then the
chloride leaves. 

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.233
So you have this with these
electronegative groups on it, 

00:22:55.233 --> 00:22:58.067
and now that can be a good
leaving group. 

00:22:58.067 --> 00:23:03.633
So you've converted OH into this
good leaving group. 

00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:07.633
Why is that particular one of
interest in context of what 

00:23:07.633 --> 00:23:09.167
we've been talking about lately?

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.100
What's interesting about that
particular R group to do a 

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:18.033
substitution at that carbon? 

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.300
Linda? 

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:22.500
STUDENT: You can't attack the
back. 

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:24.033
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: I can't hear
very well. 

00:23:24.033 --> 00:23:25.000
STUDENT: You can't do a backside
attack. 

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.567
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Ahah! 

00:23:26.567 --> 00:23:29.867
You can't do a backside attack.

00:23:29.867 --> 00:23:31.900
This is like the Bartlett-Knox
thing. 

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.200
It's set up so you can't get a
nucleophile to the backside. 

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.400
The alternative, remember, was
to have it 

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.400
leave, and leave a cation. 

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.900
Just leave without the help from
being pushed backside. 

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:52.133
But, what we learn from this,
the fact that we got 100% 

00:23:52.133 --> 00:23:54.667
yield, is that we can do that. 

00:23:54.667 --> 00:23:56.300
So these rings are bigger. 

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.700
Remember the one that Bartlett
and Knox made. 

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.300
The bridges were two carbons,
two carbons, and one carbon. 

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.367
Here the rings are much bigger,
so it's easier to 

00:24:05.367 --> 00:24:09.767
distort the angles in order to
flatten the rings. 

00:24:09.767 --> 00:24:16.533
So we can do substitution
involving bridgehead cations, 

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:19.433
just not when the rings are very
small. 

00:24:19.433 --> 00:24:22.333
But what you learn here is that
this leaving group is 

00:24:22.333 --> 00:24:25.100
good enough to do that, even
though it's a bridgehead. 

00:24:27.633 --> 00:24:30.467
Another trick is this one called
the Appel Reaction. 

00:24:30.467 --> 00:24:33.567
I took this figure from
Wikipedia. 

00:24:33.567 --> 00:24:37.700
The reagents that you add to the
alcohol, are 

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.033
triphenylphosphine and carbon 

00:24:40.033 --> 00:24:42.533
tetrachloride, an unusual
reagent. 

00:24:42.533 --> 00:24:44.000
You more often would think of
that as a 

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.333
solvent then as a reagent. 

00:24:46.333 --> 00:24:48.867
But as you see, what happens is
the unshared pair on 

00:24:48.867 --> 00:24:53.267
phosphorus does a substitution
on carbon tetrachloride. 

00:24:53.267 --> 00:24:58.167
But the phosphorus attacks
chloride, not carbon. 

00:24:58.167 --> 00:25:02.100
So it attacks the chloride and
CCl3 minus 

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.700
is the leaving group. 

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.700
Because the three chlorines are
sufficiently electron 

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:10.933
attractive, that the anion is
not a bad anion. 

00:25:10.933 --> 00:25:15.300
The pKa of chloroform is 24, so
it's pretty easy to 

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.467
generate that anion and lose a
proton. 

00:25:18.467 --> 00:25:22.467
Now notice at this stage when
you add the alcohol, its pKa 

00:25:22.467 --> 00:25:27.767
is about 17, so the
trichloromethyl anion, 

00:25:27.767 --> 00:25:34.233
although it's unusually stable
for a carbon anion, is much 

00:25:34.233 --> 00:25:39.667
more avid to get a proton, than
the O of the alcohol is. 

00:25:39.667 --> 00:25:43.533
So this base that you've made in
the first reaction, the 

00:25:43.533 --> 00:25:47.000
leaving group takes the proton
off the alcohol and 

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.333
now you have OR-. 

00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:56.900
But now you have the possibility
for chloride to 

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.567
attack this carbon where you've
made 

00:25:59.567 --> 00:26:01.033
this new bond here. 

00:26:01.033 --> 00:26:04.200
That's probably an association
followed by dissociation. 

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.533
But notice the substitution is
at phosphorus, because the O 

00:26:09.533 --> 00:26:12.433
attacked the phosphorus and
chloride came off. 

00:26:12.433 --> 00:26:13.333
So here's the chloride. 

00:26:13.333 --> 00:26:16.800
It does a nucleophilic
substitution now at carbon, 

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:23.133
and Ph3PO, triphenylphosphine
oxide, is the leaving group. 

00:26:23.133 --> 00:26:24.533
And that's a super leaving
group. 

00:26:24.533 --> 00:26:28.867
This is a very strong bond, the
P-O double bond there. 

00:26:28.867 --> 00:26:34.767
So this converted what would
have been an OH leaving group 

00:26:34.767 --> 00:26:39.967
into this triphenylphosphine
cation, which leaves to make 

00:26:39.967 --> 00:26:42.633
triphenylphosphine oxide. 

00:26:42.633 --> 00:26:44.700
So again you've made a very good
leaving 

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:45.667
group out of an oxygen. 

00:26:45.667 --> 00:26:47.833
So what this shows is that
they're lots of 

00:26:47.833 --> 00:26:49.800
ways to skin a cat. 

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.633
OH minus is a terrible leaving
group, but we have lots of 

00:26:52.633 --> 00:26:54.933
different ways of going at it. 

00:26:54.933 --> 00:26:57.067
You can protonate it. 

00:26:57.067 --> 00:27:01.233
You can use SOCl2. 

00:27:01.233 --> 00:27:06.167
You can use the phosphorus
chlorides or bromides. 

00:27:06.167 --> 00:27:07.600
Phosphorus halides. 

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:11.500
And you can do this funny trick
in the Appel Reaction 

00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:15.367
using triphenylphosphine and
carbon tetrachloride. 

00:27:15.367 --> 00:27:21.633
Here's an example from the Jones
book, 

00:27:21.633 --> 00:27:25.367
where the OH is made into a
leaving group by 

00:27:25.367 --> 00:27:28.133
triphenylphosphine and carbon
tetrachloride. 

00:27:28.133 --> 00:27:31.600
It says it was done over a day
at room temperature, and 

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.467
here's the chloride. 

00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:36.133
Notice it inverted. The presence
of deuteriums here 

00:27:36.133 --> 00:27:40.100
allows you to know whether the
configuration 

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.233
is retained or inverted. 

00:27:42.233 --> 00:27:45.600
And as you expect with an SN2
reaction, it's inverted. 

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:53.633
So we've looked a lot at this
mechanism. 

00:27:53.633 --> 00:27:57.933
Let's see how you can use
knowledge of the mechanism to 

00:27:57.933 --> 00:27:59.267
do something useful. 

00:27:59.267 --> 00:28:04.600
In this particular case it was
to maximize synthetic speed in 

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:08.633
order to make PET scanning
possible. 

00:28:08.633 --> 00:28:10.400
Do people know what PET scanning
is? 

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.967
PET, what the P stands for? 

00:28:12.967 --> 00:28:13.833
STUDENT: Positron. 

00:28:13.833 --> 00:28:16.700
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: The P is
positron. 

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:19.000
And what is a positron? 

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.067
It's something you don't
encounter very often. 

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:24.300
You can't buy a bottle of it. 

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:25.200
STUDENT: Antimatter. 

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.000
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Pardon me? 

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.767
STUDENT: It's antimatter. 

00:28:26.767 --> 00:28:27.800
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: It's
antimatter. 

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.367
It's a positive electron. 

00:28:30.367 --> 00:28:33.200
It's an electronic that has a
positive charge instead of a 

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:34.400
negative charge. 

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.967
So that's a positron. 

00:28:35.967 --> 00:28:37.500
Now where do you get positrons?

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.867
STUDENT: Magic... 

00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:49.200
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: You get them
by nuclear decay. 

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:54.533
Unstable isotopes decay to give
a number of particles, 

00:28:54.533 --> 00:29:03.067
especially in the case of F-18.

00:29:03.067 --> 00:29:07.900
F-18 can have one of its protons
in the 

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.100
nucleus become a neutron. 

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.500
That is it's the same particle,
but it loses a 

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.767
positive charge. 

00:29:17.767 --> 00:29:20.200
So a proton becomes a neutron. 

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:24.833
So instead of fluoride, it's now
oxygen. 

00:29:24.833 --> 00:29:27.767
So you've made a new element. 

00:29:27.767 --> 00:29:29.767
And it's lost a positive charge.

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:33.033
So if it was F-, it's oxygen
double minus. 

00:29:33.033 --> 00:29:37.267
But it's the same mass, 18,
because all you lost was this 

00:29:37.267 --> 00:29:39.200
positive electron. 

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:43.267
Now when you have a positive
electron, it goes away 

00:29:43.267 --> 00:29:46.333
instantly because the antimatter
meets it's 

00:29:46.333 --> 00:29:50.500
corresponding matter, an
electron right where it lives. 

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.133
It's made right there, but
they're a zillion electrons 

00:29:54.133 --> 00:29:56.800
around, even on the same atom
there are electrons. 

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:00.900
So when the electron and a
positron meet one another, 

00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.700
they annihilate. 

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:08.000
They go away, and what comes out
is two photons, gamma 

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.133
particles, which as you saw,
flew off antiparallel to one 

00:30:12.133 --> 00:30:14.700
another along the same line. 

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.733
So if you have a detector you
see a flash here and a 

00:30:18.733 --> 00:30:21.300
detection over there as well. 

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.567
Now you can do that again and
again. 

00:30:23.567 --> 00:30:27.567
You can get, bingo, those two
happen at the same time. 

00:30:27.567 --> 00:30:30.400
Because they came from the same
decay. 

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.400
Or those two. 

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:35.400
So if you surround the thing
with the detector that 

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.000
can tell when things hit it,
when two things hit it at the 

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.800
same time, they came from the
same nuclear decay. 

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.000
Now do you see what you could do
with respect to imaging? 

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.667
How can you tell where the
sample that 

00:30:51.667 --> 00:30:57.333
had F-18 was? 

00:30:57.333 --> 00:31:00.133
All you know is where these
things hit your detector. 

00:31:03.133 --> 00:31:05.900
You see what you do to figure
out where they came from? 

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:06.100
Yigit? 

00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:07.000
STUDENT: Trace the lines-- 

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.300
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Aha, yes. 

00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:10.600
You trace lines. 

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.833
So if you connect those, where
they intersect is where the 

00:31:13.833 --> 00:31:15.900
fluorine-18 was. 

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.933
Each line comes from one
fluorine-18, but the sample 

00:31:18.933 --> 00:31:21.500
had a number of fluorine-18's in
it. 

00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:24.167
So you find out where the sample
was. 

00:31:26.733 --> 00:31:30.100
If you want to use this imaging
to find tumors, you 

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.300
have to find some way to get
fluorine-18 to 

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.933
where the tumor is. 

00:31:34.933 --> 00:31:38.567
And then if you surround the
patient with this detector and 

00:31:38.567 --> 00:31:43.333
measure these simultaneous
flashes, or detection events, 

00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:45.233
then you know where that
substance was. 

00:31:45.233 --> 00:31:48.067
So if you can make that
substance be in the tumor, 

00:31:48.067 --> 00:31:49.333
then you're home free. 

00:31:51.867 --> 00:31:54.033
You can read about it, as I did,
in Wikipedia. 

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:02.333
But you have to do this really
quickly after you've prepared 

00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:04.100
the element. 

00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:07.500
So you prepare the element,
F-18, but its half-life is 

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.333
only 110 minutes. 

00:32:09.333 --> 00:32:12.300
So you don't have much time to
make it into something that 

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:14.367
will go where the tumor is. 

00:32:14.367 --> 00:32:17.267
So speed is of the essence in
doing whatever kind of 

00:32:17.267 --> 00:32:19.267
synthesis you're going to get. 

00:32:19.267 --> 00:32:21.800
Now where do you get F-18? 

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:26.033
You get it from O-18, the same
as the product by adding a 

00:32:26.033 --> 00:32:28.367
proton and losing a neutron. 

00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:38.400
So you don't change the mass,
but you put a positive charge 

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:44.900
into the nucleus so you get
fluorine instead of oxygen. 

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:50.300
OK fine if you have O-18--you
buy O-18, but where are you 

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.833
going to get a proton that's
going really fast? 

00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:56.233
Seven million electron volts. 

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.433
You have to get it from an
accelerator. 

00:33:04.433 --> 00:33:07.400
From a cyclotron. 

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.733
Now you can also do it in place
of fluorine you could 

00:33:11.733 --> 00:33:14.633
have carbon, or nitrogen, or
oxygen, but they have even 

00:33:14.633 --> 00:33:15.700
shorter half-lives. 

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.800
So you have to work even quicker
in order to have any 

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:21.167
there at the time to get it
where you 

00:33:21.167 --> 00:33:22.967
want it to be detected. 

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:26.800
Now if you go on to the
petcenter.yale.edu, you see 

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:30.433
that they do this positron
emission tomography. 

00:33:30.433 --> 00:33:33.400
And you see what they have is a
cyclotron that generates 

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.500
these high-energy protons, that
can convert one element 

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.700
into one of these radioactive
elements that 

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:39.967
will generate positrons. 

00:33:42.467 --> 00:33:45.367
And you see they have a water
target so that 

00:33:45.367 --> 00:33:47.433
you can produce fluoride. 

00:33:47.433 --> 00:33:50.400
They also have targets to
produce those other elements I 

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:51.667
talked about. 

00:33:51.667 --> 00:33:53.500
And they say they also have two

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.633
fluorine-18 synthesis modules--

00:33:56.633 --> 00:33:59.700
one for nucleophilic
substitution, and one for 

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:03.067
electrophilic substitution. 

00:34:03.067 --> 00:34:08.667
So they have the facility for
making this stuff and then 

00:34:08.667 --> 00:34:13.500
doing reactions quickly with it,
but the question is what 

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.767
are you going to synthesize so
that it will go to a tumor, so 

00:34:16.767 --> 00:34:18.400
you can find where the tumor is?

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.567
And you have to do it really
quickly. 

00:34:21.567 --> 00:34:26.500
Well glucose is the basis of
metabolism, and tumors are 

00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.667
growing rapidly, so they really
snarf up glucose. 

00:34:33.867 --> 00:34:39.233
So if you had F-18 in glucose,
that might do the trick. 

00:34:39.233 --> 00:34:44.000
If you could make
2-fluoroglucose, with an F-18 

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.600
in it, maybe that would be
sucked up by the tumors the 

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.733
same way that glucose is. 

00:34:51.733 --> 00:34:54.233
So we need to make that molecule
as quickly as 

00:34:54.233 --> 00:34:55.467
possible from glucose. 

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.900
Well, let's just do a
nucleophilic substitution. 

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:03.700
Fluoride in, hydroxide out. 

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.333
Does that sound good? 

00:35:06.333 --> 00:35:08.533
Or might there be problems with
that in 

00:35:08.533 --> 00:35:10.933
doing the SN2 reaction? 

00:35:10.933 --> 00:35:14.467
Can you think of a problem doing
this reaction? 

00:35:14.467 --> 00:35:18.333
Fluoride comes in, displaces OH
to give the compound on the 

00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:21.767
right which has the same shape
as glucose. 

00:35:21.767 --> 00:35:24.133
Lauren, what's the funny problem
you see? 

00:35:24.133 --> 00:35:24.967
STUDENT: OH isn't a good leaving
group. 

00:35:24.967 --> 00:35:26.467
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: The hydroxide
is a 

00:35:26.467 --> 00:35:28.200
crummy leaving group. 

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.667
Whoops, and it was supposed to
come up there, but it didn't. 

00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:34.700
I had anticipated you. 

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.300
I think I did. 

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.533
Let's see what the next one is.

00:35:37.533 --> 00:35:38.100
Yes. 

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:42.100
But it could be that the wrong
carbon gets attacked. 

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:43.533
There are lots of OH's here. 

00:35:43.533 --> 00:35:45.933
Even if it could be attacked,
the others 

00:35:45.933 --> 00:35:47.367
could be just as good. 

00:35:47.367 --> 00:35:51.233
And if you did SN2 displacement
at the oxygen, 

00:35:51.233 --> 00:35:54.400
even if you attack that one, it
would give the wrong 

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.567
fluorine-18 arrangement. 

00:35:58.567 --> 00:36:00.133
There's Lauren's. 

00:36:00.133 --> 00:36:03.200
It's a terrible leaving group. 

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.500
That's not all that's wrong with
this. 

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:11.867
A fluoride is a horrid
nucleophile as we saw. 

00:36:11.867 --> 00:36:15.067
It's tied up by
hydrogen-bonding. 

00:36:15.067 --> 00:36:16.733
So you have to break the
hydrogen bonds. 

00:36:16.733 --> 00:36:20.567
And it's very small and highly
charged, so it has very strong 

00:36:20.567 --> 00:36:22.000
hydrogen bonds. 

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.733
And furthermore, it's tied up by
the potassium cation which 

00:36:27.733 --> 00:36:28.933
makes it less reactive. 

00:36:28.933 --> 00:36:32.400
So you've got lots and lots of
problems, so that doesn't look 

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:35.800
like it's going to do the trick.

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.567
Now can we address these
problems on the basis of what 

00:36:39.567 --> 00:36:40.867
we've been talking about? 

00:36:40.867 --> 00:36:44.333
Can we figure out some way of
doing it so we can do this 

00:36:44.333 --> 00:36:48.167
transformation really rapidly
after the cyclotron generates 

00:36:48.167 --> 00:36:52.700
this stuff, that half of it's
going away every couple hours. 

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.733
How about the SN2 inversion
gives the wrong configuration? 

00:36:56.733 --> 00:36:59.467
What could we do to get the
right configuration if we did 

00:36:59.467 --> 00:37:00.767
an inversion? 

00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:05.700
Use a different starting
material. 

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.267
And it turns out that mannose,
which has this OH axial 

00:37:09.267 --> 00:37:11.667
pointing up is readily
available. 

00:37:11.667 --> 00:37:12.900
It's a different sugar. 

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:16.300
And if you did substitution on
that, you'd get the equatorial 

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.167
thing that you wanted. 

00:37:18.167 --> 00:37:19.867
So that's no problem. 

00:37:19.867 --> 00:37:20.967
Now we have the problem that the

00:37:20.967 --> 00:37:25.233
wrong CO could be attacked. 

00:37:25.233 --> 00:37:29.233
There are one, two, three, four,
five 

00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:31.733
different C-OH's in here. 

00:37:31.733 --> 00:37:35.500
So what you have to do is make
one of them 

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:38.300
different from the others. 

00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:40.000
The one you want to attack has
to be 

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.300
different from the others. 

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:45.033
And the way you do it has been
known a long 

00:37:45.033 --> 00:37:48.133
time in sugar chemistry. 

00:37:48.133 --> 00:37:51.600
Which is, you can protect some
of the groups 

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.500
and not another one. 

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:59.333
So what's done here is to put
acetyl groups on all the other 

00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:03.533
four, but not on this particular
OH. 

00:38:03.533 --> 00:38:05.700
How that's done we won't go into
now. 

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.167
That's a topic in sugar
chemistry. 

00:38:08.167 --> 00:38:11.000
But you know how to do it. 

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.800
But there's a problem here still

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.333
that OH minus is a horrid
leaving group. 

00:38:16.333 --> 00:38:18.967
It's now different from the
others, but it's a horrid 

00:38:18.967 --> 00:38:23.033
leaving group and acetate is a
better leaving group. 

00:38:23.033 --> 00:38:26.067
It's a more acidic compound--
acetic acid-- 

00:38:26.067 --> 00:38:27.400
than water. 

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.700
Better anion. 

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:31.600
So what are we going to do now?

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.033
Lauren, this was your problem. 

00:38:34.033 --> 00:38:36.400
That the OH minus, was a bad
leaving group. 

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:36.900
What can we do? 

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.833
STUDENT: Try to protonate it. 

00:38:41.833 --> 00:38:45.833
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: We could
protonate it, but you could 

00:38:45.833 --> 00:38:48.633
protonate the acetates too and
make them better leaving 

00:38:48.633 --> 00:38:50.800
groups, so that won't do the
trick. 

00:38:56.033 --> 00:38:59.633
What they did, was convert it
into a sulfonic acid. 

00:38:59.633 --> 00:39:02.900
The one that Kenyon and Phillips
did had a phenyl 

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.067
group here, or toluene
actually-- 

00:39:05.067 --> 00:39:07.533
a benzene with a methyl on the
edge of it. 

00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:09.267
This is CF3. 

00:39:09.267 --> 00:39:13.433
Why might CF3 three be better
than just a regular old 

00:39:13.433 --> 00:39:17.033
hydrocarbon like toluene? 

00:39:17.033 --> 00:39:20.233
It's got the fluorines in it
that are electron withdrawing. 

00:39:20.233 --> 00:39:20.333
So it makes the anion that
you're 

00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:21.600
going to want to leave-- 

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:30.067
this OSO2CF3 is a much stronger
acid, a much more 

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:32.133
stable anion, and a better
leaving group. 

00:39:35.833 --> 00:39:40.567
The pKa of the corresponding
acid here is -14. 

00:39:40.567 --> 00:39:42.700
It's called a super acid. 

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.167
Remember that the strongest that
we've talked about so 

00:39:45.167 --> 00:39:47.500
far, had a pKa of -11. 

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.533
This is a 1,000 times stronger
than HI. 

00:39:51.533 --> 00:39:54.433
So we put on a really super
leaving group. 

00:39:54.433 --> 00:39:58.233
It's trifluormethansulfonate,
and called triflate. 

00:40:01.267 --> 00:40:05.333
So now we have a compound that's
as good as we can make 

00:40:05.333 --> 00:40:11.967
it for being attacked at this
center, not the others. 

00:40:11.967 --> 00:40:14.433
For having a great leaving
group, and for having the 

00:40:14.433 --> 00:40:18.700
proper stereochemistry so that
we'll get the fluoride where 

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:19.133
we want it. 

00:40:19.133 --> 00:40:22.767
And now we have to do the
reaction with fluoride. 

00:40:22.767 --> 00:40:25.100
Notice that all this can be done
ahead of time. 

00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:29.433
We can have the bottom right
molecule, take however much 

00:40:29.433 --> 00:40:30.933
time we want to make it. 

00:40:30.933 --> 00:40:32.767
Now we have it in a bottle. 

00:40:32.767 --> 00:40:35.500
We go to the cyclotron at the
medical school, get 

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:40.600
fluoride-18, and try to do our
substitution. 

00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:43.933
Now we have to introduce the
fluoride-18. 

00:40:43.933 --> 00:40:48.500
So we have to go from this
protected triflate to this 

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:53.967
compound as soon as we can,
because the fluorides 

00:40:53.967 --> 00:40:58.033
getting off these positrons all
the time. 

00:40:58.033 --> 00:41:03.100
So let's react it with potassium
fluoride, with 

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.467
fluoride-18. 

00:41:05.467 --> 00:41:07.733
What's the problem? 

00:41:07.733 --> 00:41:10.200
The fluoride is tied up by
hydrogen bonding. 

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.267
It's not a good nucleophile. 

00:41:12.267 --> 00:41:15.267
How could we get around that
problem with the hydrogen 

00:41:15.267 --> 00:41:16.867
bonding deactivating fluoride? 

00:41:23.933 --> 00:41:25.200
Any ideas on that one? 

00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:28.800
How can you do that? 

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:29.300
Lauren? 

00:41:29.300 --> 00:41:30.267
STUDENT: Could changing the
solvent help? 

00:41:30.267 --> 00:41:32.367
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Change the
solvent to something that 

00:41:32.367 --> 00:41:34.400
can't make hydrogen bonds. 

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:40.600
So they use acetonitrile, methyl
cyanide, which doesn't 

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.767
have any hydrogen bonding
protons in it. 

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:46.567
It has CH protons, but those
aren't involved in hydrogen 

00:41:46.567 --> 00:41:48.600
bonding, so that's no problem. 

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.767
But we still have this last
problem. 

00:41:50.767 --> 00:41:55.000
The potassium cation is going to
be tightly associated with 

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.400
the fluroide, and we're going to
have to break it away to 

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.333
make the fluoride more reactive.

00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:02.700
How can we get rid of the
potassium cation? 

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:12.133
Remember the problem is that a
single potassium atom is 

00:42:12.133 --> 00:42:13.500
rather small. 

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:17.600
If it were big then it wouldn't
attract by Coulomb's 

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.167
Law, the fluoride so tightly. 

00:42:19.167 --> 00:42:20.433
Then you wouldn't have to worry
about it. 

00:42:20.433 --> 00:42:23.633
How could we make potassium big?

00:42:23.633 --> 00:42:25.167
Arvind, did you have an idea? 

00:42:25.167 --> 00:42:32.900
STUDENT: Don't atoms get bigger
if you add an electron? 

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:36.100
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Well, if you
add an electron to the 

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.633
potassium cation, it's not a
cation anymore. 

00:42:38.633 --> 00:42:40.833
It's not the thing that's
associated. 

00:42:40.833 --> 00:42:42.700
It has to still be a cation, but
you 

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.667
want to make it bigger. 

00:42:44.667 --> 00:42:47.300
How do you make a potassium
cation big? 

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:47.567
Nate? 

00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:48.500
STUDENT: Move the electrons to
higher energy orbitals. 

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:57.200
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: That's an
interesting idea, but I don't 

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:00.733
think it's practical, because
you couldn't have enough light 

00:43:00.733 --> 00:43:05.900
to make a significant number of
them bigger all at the same 

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:10.233
time, without just blowing
everything apart. 

00:43:10.233 --> 00:43:11.067
Matt? 

00:43:11.067 --> 00:43:13.300
STUDENT: Could you separate it
using a crown ether? 

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.000
PROFESSOR MCBRIDE: Aha! 

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.167
Crown ether. 

00:43:15.167 --> 00:43:19.233
Or even better, a cryptate. 

00:43:19.233 --> 00:43:20.767
So you make it big that way. 

00:43:20.767 --> 00:43:23.100
And now the fluoride is a good
nucleophile. 

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.833
There's no hydrogen bonding. 

00:43:24.833 --> 00:43:26.600
The cation is really big. 

00:43:29.167 --> 00:43:30.700
And now you can do that. 

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.633
So that's how they do it. 

00:43:33.633 --> 00:43:38.800
So it's all using these ideas to
figure out how to tune the 

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:42.233
SN2 reaction to make it as
efficient as possible. 

00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:43.700
And of course there's one more
step. 

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.033
You have to then take off these
acetate groups. 

00:43:46.033 --> 00:43:47.700
But you can do that just by
treating it 

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.767
with water and acid. 

00:43:50.767 --> 00:43:55.100
Here's an example of a PET scan
image that's measured one 

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.600
hour after administering. 

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.933
So you not only have to make the
stuff, you have to give it 

00:44:00.933 --> 00:44:03.267
to the patient, and the patient
has to process it 

00:44:03.267 --> 00:44:07.500
enough that compound gets to
where the tumor is. 

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:10.000
It just goes to where glucose is
being consumed. 

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.233
The 2-fluoroglucose. 

00:44:12.233 --> 00:44:15.500
One place that a lot of glucose
is being 

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:16.767
consumed is up there. 

00:44:16.767 --> 00:44:18.033
Where's that? 

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:21.800
Is it happening for you? 

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:25.633
If I had given you
2-fluoroglucose, and was 

00:44:25.633 --> 00:44:26.933
looking at your positrons, would
I see 

00:44:26.933 --> 00:44:29.133
them coming from here? 

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:30.867
That's where a lot of
metabolism-- 

00:44:30.867 --> 00:44:33.000
but unfortunately also there. 

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.300
And if we slice through there,
and tip it up you can see that 

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.700
that's the tumor that was
located this way. 

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.800
So the metabolism is in the
brain, but also in the 

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.800
cancerous lymphnode. 

00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:51.367
Understanding how nucleophilic
substitution works, and how to 

00:44:51.367 --> 00:44:57.067
control it was crucial in
designing this technique. 

00:44:57.067 --> 00:45:01.000
Now one last topic, which
I'll just introduce

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.467
here and then we'll
complete next time.

00:45:05.467 --> 00:45:08.667
We've talked about
stereochemistry, rate law, and 

00:45:08.667 --> 00:45:10.200
rate constant. 

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:14.100
But can you do actual structural
work? 

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.867
Remember how we talked about the
mechanism of a nucleophile 

00:45:17.867 --> 00:45:20.267
attacking a carbonyl group? 

00:45:20.267 --> 00:45:21.733
And you could do it by X-ray? 

00:45:21.733 --> 00:45:23.567
You could get a bunch of
different compounds and add 

00:45:23.567 --> 00:45:25.667
nitrogens in different positions
relative to the 

00:45:25.667 --> 00:45:28.400
carbonyl, and you could put them
together in sort of a 

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:32.267
movie in the Burgi-Dunitz
material that we did last 

00:45:32.267 --> 00:45:34.900
semester and see the stage of
the reaction. 

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.600
Might you be able to do that for
nucleophilic substitution? 

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.100
Might you be able to use X-ray,
and if not X-ray at 

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:45.667
least use quantum mechanics, to
see what the structure of 

00:45:45.667 --> 00:45:46.900
this intermediate is. 

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:52.333
Because so far we've mostly been
beating up on the 

00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:55.700
dissociation/association
mechanisms. Most of the things 

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.967
we've disproven are things that
involve that mechanism 

00:45:58.967 --> 00:46:01.067
with the trivalent carbon
intermediate. 

00:46:01.067 --> 00:46:02.767
Although it can happen, and
we're going to 

00:46:02.767 --> 00:46:04.833
talk about it next-- 

00:46:04.833 --> 00:46:08.700
go through the intermediate
cation. 

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.000
So there are some cases where it
in fact applies. 

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.600
But the tougher problem is to
distinguish between concerted 

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:20.733
and association/dissociation
with a very weakly stabilized 

00:46:20.733 --> 00:46:23.667
pentavalent intermediate. 

00:46:23.667 --> 00:46:26.367
There's stuff on the course
website about that. 

00:46:26.367 --> 00:46:29.533
But the question is, might there
be a pentavalent 

00:46:29.533 --> 00:46:33.500
intermediate instead of the
concerted transition state? 

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:35.533
So here's the transition state,
which 

00:46:35.533 --> 00:46:37.467
is an energy maximum. 

00:46:37.467 --> 00:46:39.767
Here's the pentavalent
intermediate. 

00:46:39.767 --> 00:46:42.033
So there would be nothing to see
at the 

00:46:42.033 --> 00:46:43.300
transition state here. 

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.667
It wouldn't last any time. 

00:46:44.667 --> 00:46:47.067
It's just passing through. 

00:46:47.067 --> 00:46:50.667
But if there were a little
dimple up at the top, there 

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:52.700
could be some stability. 

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:56.667
That is, that is a stable
pentavalent carbon. 

00:46:56.667 --> 00:46:58.733
But does it exist? 

00:46:58.733 --> 00:47:03.500
You can see that it would merge
smoothly into one if it 

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:07.100
just had a teeny tiny dimple, or
a little bit bigger dimple. 

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.600
If it were big enough, you might
be able to prepare it 

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.900
under some circumstances where
you could actually 

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.700
see it, say an X-ray. 

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.000
But if it's too small, you're
never going to see it. 

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.700
You might be able to try to
calculate 

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.367
it by quantum mechanics. 

00:47:21.367 --> 00:47:24.033
So the question is, is there an
example of 

00:47:24.033 --> 00:47:25.700
a pentavalent carbon? 

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:31.000
So by quantum mechanics, they
said that for water, 

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:37.933
displacing H2O, that cation,
that symmetrical compound 

00:47:37.933 --> 00:47:41.733
there is actually a transition
state, not an intermediate. 

00:47:41.733 --> 00:47:45.433
It goes downhill if you lengthen
one bond 

00:47:45.433 --> 00:47:47.133
and shorten the other. 

00:47:47.133 --> 00:47:49.300
The same is true in the anion. 

00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:51.400
These are calculations of
isolated 

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.333
materials, so gas phase. 

00:47:53.333 --> 00:47:57.567
If you have OH minus come in and
displace OH minus, that 

00:47:57.567 --> 00:48:01.667
one quantum mechanics also says
is transition state. 

00:48:01.667 --> 00:48:04.633
But neither reaction is
practical in the laboratory. 

00:48:04.633 --> 00:48:07.933
So the question is, what does
experiment say? 

00:48:07.933 --> 00:48:11.367
Can you do X-ray studies and
actually see whether there 

00:48:11.367 --> 00:48:14.200
might be a stable pentavalent--

00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:17.467
maybe very transiently stable,
very weakly 

00:48:17.467 --> 00:48:18.900
stabilized, but might that 

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.233
pentavalent compound be stable?

00:48:21.233 --> 00:48:23.700
So that's what we'll talk about
with the X-ray 

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.833
material next time.

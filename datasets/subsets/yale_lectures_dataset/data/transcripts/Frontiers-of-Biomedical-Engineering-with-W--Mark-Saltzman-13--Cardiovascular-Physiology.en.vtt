00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.334
Professor Mark Saltzman:
This week we're going to

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:18.917
talk about cardiovascular
physiology and the

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:23.018
cardiovascular system,
which includes the blood,

00:00:23.018 --> 00:00:26.470
the blood vessels,
and the heart.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.750
We're going to focus on several
features.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.298
This is obviously a big topic,
not only understanding the

00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:37.340
basic physiology of the
cardiovascular system,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.335
but what can fail in the
cardiovascular system in

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:42.897
disease.
Of course, cardiovascular

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:47.392
disease is the number one or two
cause of deaths in Western

00:00:47.392 --> 00:00:50.640
world.
So, it's serious and important

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.949
topic for medicine.
It's also something that I

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.860
realize you probably all know
something about.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.434
We're going to try to look at
things in a slightly different

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:03.159
way, look at them the way that
an engineer,

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.074
a biomedical engineer might
look at the cardiovascular

00:01:07.074 --> 00:01:10.620
system, to try to understand the
relationship.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.994
In particular,
between pressure,

00:01:12.994 --> 00:01:16.364
blood pressure,
which is the force that moves

00:01:16.364 --> 00:01:20.730
blood around through the
circulatory system and flow;

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.626
the actual movement of blood,
which is what's essential for

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:28.120
distributing oxygen and
nutrients and everything else

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.480
that we move around in our
circulatory system.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.436
I'm going to talk briefly
about the anatomy of the heart

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:37.693
in the circulatory system.
We'll start by thinking about

00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:41.049
the whole level.
I'm going to talk in some

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.860
detail about how pressure
differences generate flow,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.059
starting with a very simple
example and building up to some

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:54.041
of the complexity that we have
within our cardiovascular

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:57.290
systems.
One of the most amazing things

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.973
about the cardiovascular system
is its ability to change the

00:02:01.973 --> 00:02:06.735
pattern of blood's flow such
that organs that need more blood

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:10.201
can get more blood.
It's not just that there's a

00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:13.493
static system where blood is
flowing throughout the body and

00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:16.449
it flows at the same rate
everywhere all the time.

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:20.285
It increases in one region and
decreases in another in response

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:23.834
to physiological need.
We'll talk about the sort

00:02:23.834 --> 00:02:28.033
of engineering principle that
the cardiovascular system uses

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:31.449
to accomplish that.
Then next week we'll talk

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.814
about--we'll talk in some detail
this Thursday about how the

00:02:35.814 --> 00:02:40.179
heart generates the pressure
that's needed to move the blood

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:44.618
and how you can create this flow
with a relatively simple but

00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:47.780
durable machine,
the heart.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.422
Next Tuesday we'll talk about
cardiac conduction

00:02:53.422 --> 00:02:58.945
electrophysiology,
how the heart regulates it's

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:05.548
beating in order to generate
orderly pattern of pressure

00:03:05.548 --> 00:03:09.274
generation.
This is a cartoon of the

00:03:09.274 --> 00:03:12.992
cardiovascular system,
not showing the blood except by

00:03:12.992 --> 00:03:15.939
the colors here,
but showing the heart.

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.575
In the center of this diagram
is the heart and surrounding it

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:25.288
is sort of a schematic diagram
like you might see for plumbing

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:29.460
in a house but certainly not in
anatomical detail;

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.447
this drawing isn't of how blood
flows from the heart to all the

00:03:34.447 --> 00:03:38.440
other regions of the body.
Let's just--now I know that

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.436
you've seen diagrams like this
before, you understand the basic

00:03:42.436 --> 00:03:46.362
connections between things,
but let's just go through them

00:03:46.362 --> 00:03:49.283
briefly.
You have to start somewhere

00:03:49.283 --> 00:03:52.879
because this is a cyclic--it's a
closed system.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.565
You start at one point and you
go around and you come back to

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:58.956
the beginning again.
If we start in the--in this

00:03:58.956 --> 00:04:03.055
side of the heart,
this is the left side of the

00:04:03.055 --> 00:04:08.580
heart and there are two chambers
in the left side of the heart:

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.046
the atrium and the ventricle.
You see that blood blows into

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:15.870
the left side of the heart and
it's come from the lungs.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.094
The blood has come from the
lungs and so it's full of oxygen

00:04:19.094 --> 00:04:21.500
and in this diagram it's
indicated as red.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.504
If you follow the arrows here,
the blood flows from the lungs

00:04:25.504 --> 00:04:29.324
into the left atrium,
into the left ventricle,

00:04:29.324 --> 00:04:33.990
and out through a large vessel
called the aorta.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.783
Fairly simple;
so far two chambers in the

00:04:37.783 --> 00:04:41.303
heart, blood flows through these
two chambers,

00:04:41.303 --> 00:04:45.839
atrium first then ventricle,
and out through the aorta.

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:51.325
If I was able to measure flow
at this point here in the aorta,

00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:56.450
I would measure the total rate
of flow of blood out of the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.957
heart.
You measure that in volume per

00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:03.519
minute, in liters per minutes
let's say.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:07.959
All of the blood flow is coming
through this one vessel.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:11.631
If I could measure what the
flow is through the aorta over a

00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:15.398
period of time,
I would measure what's called

00:05:15.398 --> 00:05:20.721
the 'cardiac output' or the rate
of flow that the heart is

00:05:20.721 --> 00:05:25.814
producing in its function.
Now, because it's a closed

00:05:25.814 --> 00:05:30.344
system the rate of flow has to
be the same anywhere in the

00:05:30.344 --> 00:05:33.587
cycle.
If you imagined a simple tube

00:05:33.587 --> 00:05:36.899
that connects back to the--to
itself.

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:40.963
If I'm generating five liters
per minute of flow here I have

00:05:40.963 --> 00:05:44.890
to have five liters per minute
everywhere in the cycle.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.024
Otherwise what would happen?
Well, otherwise the volume of

00:05:49.024 --> 00:05:53.130
the vessels would have to be
expanding or contracting at some

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.209
point if the flow rate is
different there.

00:05:56.209 --> 00:05:59.039
It would have to be changing
with time if the flow rates

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:00.839
different and it doesn't do
that.

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.790
It's a steady state system
where there's a constant flow

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.315
all throughout the cycle.
We're going to come back to

00:06:08.315 --> 00:06:10.839
this point but it's important to
remember.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:14.053
Now, immediately after the
blood comes out in the aorta

00:06:14.053 --> 00:06:16.990
there's an opportunity for it to
go somewhere else.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.619
There's a branch point and that
first branch point is from the

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:23.345
aorta into this,
what's shown as a fairly large

00:06:23.345 --> 00:06:26.160
vessel, but they're pretty small
vessels actually.

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.641
These are the coronary
arteries, the arteries that

00:06:29.641 --> 00:06:33.834
actually bring blood to the
surface of the heart in order to

00:06:33.834 --> 00:06:37.448
nourish it.
You can imagine that the heart

00:06:37.448 --> 00:06:41.440
is using a lot of--it's using a
lot of energy.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.454
It's generating work,
that work is being transmitted

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:46.699
into pressure and flow of the
blood.

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:50.411
It gets the energy to do that
from nutrients,

00:06:50.411 --> 00:06:54.290
oxygen, glucose,
and so it needs a lot of blood

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.878
flow.
It's in the best possible

00:06:56.878 --> 00:07:01.413
position to get good blood flow
because it's getting it's blood

00:07:01.413 --> 00:07:05.069
right off of the aorta where
flow is a maximum.

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:09.140
We talked about stents last
week that are used to treat

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.351
disease in these blood vessels
and we'll talk more of that as

00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:16.370
we go through the next couple of
weeks.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:21.207
What I want you to focus on now
is just this phenomenon that the

00:07:21.207 --> 00:07:24.751
flow branches here.
Some of the blood goes further

00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:28.227
down the aorta and some of it
goes through the coronary

00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:30.419
arteries.
Now, how much blood goes in

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:33.572
which direction is going to be
one of the main things we talk

00:07:33.572 --> 00:07:35.779
about in the rest of the lecture
today,

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:38.600
but first let's just continue
in our journey around.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.674
You'll notice that this pattern
repeats that there are points

00:07:42.674 --> 00:07:45.499
where the flow branches.
For example,

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:49.297
after the aorta,
some of the flow goes up in

00:07:49.297 --> 00:07:53.128
ascending arteries.
This goes up above the heart

00:07:53.128 --> 00:07:54.882
into the head,
for example,

00:07:54.882 --> 00:07:58.592
and so the carotid arteries
which carry blood flow up to

00:07:58.592 --> 00:08:02.100
your brain are descendants of
this branch here.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:05.201
Those are important;
blood to the brain is pretty

00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.140
important.
Also, blood goes down through

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.864
the abdominal aorta,
so it splits in two directions

00:08:11.864 --> 00:08:15.799
down the abdominal aorta,
That blood goes to your legs

00:08:15.799 --> 00:08:19.630
and all of your visceral organs
that are below the heart.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.512
This pattern repeats itself.
A pattern of flow,

00:08:23.512 --> 00:08:27.353
branch, branch,
branch to ever smaller branches

00:08:27.353 --> 00:08:32.029
so that you can serve ever
smaller regions of tissue.

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:36.894
Now, these vessels that
carry oxygenated blood are

00:08:36.894 --> 00:08:41.759
called arteries and they have
thick muscular walls.

00:08:41.759 --> 00:08:44.568
They're generally large
diameter, a centimeter or so,

00:08:44.568 --> 00:08:47.755
there's a table in your book
that gives you the diameters of

00:08:47.755 --> 00:08:51.902
different kinds of vessels.
They don't exchange materials

00:08:51.902 --> 00:08:56.239
with their outside environment.
You can think of these as

00:08:56.239 --> 00:09:00.102
conduits whose function is to
carry blood from the heart to a

00:09:00.102 --> 00:09:03.324
particular organ,
but not to exchange nutrients,

00:09:03.324 --> 00:09:06.419
not to exchange oxygen,
they're just carrying the

00:09:06.419 --> 00:09:08.775
blood.
Eventually, if we looked for

00:09:08.775 --> 00:09:12.135
example, at the branch of this
artery that goes to the

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.484
digestive tract,
for example,

00:09:14.484 --> 00:09:19.442
to the organs of the gut where
digestion takes place,

00:09:19.442 --> 00:09:25.449
you have continual branching of
these arteries until they become

00:09:25.449 --> 00:09:29.934
very fine.
Those smallest conducting

00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:37.509
pathways are called arterioles,
small arteries or arterioles.

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:40.210
Now they have the same basic
anatomy as an artery.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:44.215
They have a muscular wall and
we'll talk about why that's

00:09:44.215 --> 00:09:48.291
important in a minute and they
don't conduct any nutrients

00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:51.700
across their surface,
they're just smaller.

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:57.055
Eventually those arterioles
branch into very fine vessels

00:09:57.055 --> 00:10:00.934
called capillaries.
It's in these capillary beds,

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:04.321
which are illustrated here by
these little meshes,

00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:07.639
where you have the smallest
diameter vessels.

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:11.391
They're feeding very particular
regions of tissue,

00:10:11.391 --> 00:10:15.908
not your whole intestine but
only a very small region of the

00:10:15.908 --> 00:10:20.556
intestine.
They have thin walls that lack

00:10:20.556 --> 00:10:23.240
muscle;
they're not muscular walls.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:28.004
It's in these capillary beds
that exchange of nutrients takes

00:10:28.004 --> 00:10:30.751
place.
It's in these capillary beds

00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:33.692
that exchange of oxygen,
carbon dioxide,

00:10:33.692 --> 00:10:37.840
sugar, amino acids--that takes
place in capillaries.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:44.700
Capillaries are not muscular
but they're able to transport

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:49.544
nutrients and molecules.
What's happened as we've

00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:51.750
gone from the aorta,
a single vessel,

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:54.322
down to a capillary bed and
there are many,

00:10:54.322 --> 00:10:56.649
many capillary beds in your
body.

00:10:56.649 --> 00:11:00.605
Well, if I could take a
cross-section at any point--a

00:11:00.605 --> 00:11:05.092
cross-section of this--then the
total flow rate into all the

00:11:05.092 --> 00:11:08.200
capillaries,
the total flow rate through all

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.737
the capillaries has to be the
same as the flow rate through

00:11:11.737 --> 00:11:14.786
the aorta.
By this process of branching

00:11:14.786 --> 00:11:18.333
where this total flow of 5L/min
gets divided,

00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:20.590
and divided,
and divided.

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.085
By the time it gets to a
capillary there's a very small

00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:26.610
vessel carrying a very low flow
rate,

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:31.113
a very small fraction of this
5L/min, but there's now millions

00:11:31.113 --> 00:11:34.139
of these of vessels all over
your body.

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:37.258
The blood is not flowing at a
large flow rate through a big

00:11:37.258 --> 00:11:40.700
vessel, it's flowing at a much
smaller flow rate through many,

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.974
many vessels but the total has
to add up to the total that goes

00:11:45.974 --> 00:11:47.731
in.
Well, you know the rest of

00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:50.203
the story;
the capillaries merge after

00:11:50.203 --> 00:11:54.659
they leave the tissue area.
They merge into small veins;

00:11:54.659 --> 00:12:00.070
veins are collecting tubules
for de-oxygenated blood.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.435
Now, this is blood that has
transported all of its nutrients

00:12:03.435 --> 00:12:06.686
into the tissue that it serves
so it doesn't have a lot of

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:09.534
oxygen anymore.
It has a lot of waste products

00:12:09.534 --> 00:12:12.945
now, the waste products that are
generated by these tissues

00:12:12.945 --> 00:12:16.160
during metabolism.
It has a lot of carbon dioxide

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.330
which is the end product of
glucose metabolism,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.481
it has acids that are generated
from metabolism,

00:12:23.481 --> 00:12:27.809
it has the end products of
nitrogen metabolism,

00:12:27.809 --> 00:12:32.627
which is chiefly urea and
ammonia, and that blood is

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:37.385
indicated here as a blue line.
Now, we usually show these

00:12:37.385 --> 00:12:40.221
blue colored vessels,
usually show them as red and

00:12:40.221 --> 00:12:44.039
blue, indicating lots of oxygen
red, not very much oxygen blue.

00:12:44.039 --> 00:12:46.840
It's not just oxygen that's
changed.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.088
The chemical composition has
changed dramatically,

00:12:49.088 --> 00:12:50.740
there's a lot more carbon
dioxide,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.693
there's a lot more urea,
there's a lot more of other

00:12:54.693 --> 00:12:58.259
things coming out of
the--through the veins.

00:12:58.259 --> 00:13:01.813
These small veins called
venules merge to form larger

00:13:01.813 --> 00:13:05.639
veins, eventually very large
veins like the vena cava,

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:11.269
which come back to the right
side of the heart.

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:13.716
The right side of the heart is
anatomically very similar to the

00:13:13.716 --> 00:13:15.856
left side.
There's an atrium,

00:13:15.856 --> 00:13:20.116
there's a ventricle,
and blood flows out of the

00:13:20.116 --> 00:13:25.210
ventricle through the pulmonary
artery to the lungs.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.909
Now, notice that there's
something different here;

00:13:27.909 --> 00:13:31.480
that on this side of the
circulatory system the part

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.190
where the blood is going out to
the rest of your body,

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.059
the artery contains oxygenated
blood.

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:42.378
On this side,
the pulmonary artery is an

00:13:42.378 --> 00:13:49.132
artery--it has the same features
as a systemic artery like the

00:13:49.132 --> 00:13:51.498
aorta.
It has a muscular wall,

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:53.304
for example,
and doesn't transport

00:13:53.304 --> 00:13:56.588
nutrients, so it looks an artery
but it carries de-oxygenated

00:13:56.588 --> 00:14:00.096
blood.
It's carrying it only one

00:14:00.096 --> 00:14:04.362
place, back to the lungs.
It's collected in

00:14:04.362 --> 00:14:09.042
the--collected on the other side
of the lungs now with oxygen and

00:14:09.042 --> 00:14:12.039
returns to the point where we
started.

00:14:12.039 --> 00:14:16.390
It's not just a closed
system, it's 2 closed systems.

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:23.477
One that we're going to call
the system that's fed by the

00:14:23.477 --> 00:14:27.535
left side of the heart where
oxygenated blood goes out to the

00:14:27.535 --> 00:14:31.729
whole periphery of your body and
is collected back by the right

00:14:31.729 --> 00:14:35.649
side of your heart,
that's one closed system.

00:14:35.649 --> 00:14:42.821
The second is the pulmonary
vascular system which is--the

00:14:42.821 --> 00:14:49.480
force is generated by the right
side of the heart,

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.338
the flow is generated by the
right side of the heart,

00:14:52.338 --> 00:14:55.800
flows only to the blood--to the
lungs and oxygenated blood comes

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.730
back to the left side,
so it's sort of like a figure 8;

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:06.474
one loop, a second loop.
What's the--if the rate of flow

00:15:06.474 --> 00:15:10.900
is 5L/min through the aorta,
what's the flow rate in the

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.761
pulmonary artery?
They're two independent

00:15:14.761 --> 00:15:18.409
systems, is that right?
What's the rate of flow in the

00:15:18.409 --> 00:15:19.190
pulmonary artery?

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:26.110
It has to be 5L/min because
they're not independent.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:30.382
They're really--I described
them as two closed systems,

00:15:30.382 --> 00:15:35.287
really one closed system with a
loop, so the flow has to be the

00:15:35.287 --> 00:15:36.870
same everywhere.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:46.929
Let's talk about blood flow
in these vessels for a moment.

00:15:46.929 --> 00:15:51.232
Now you have this picture of
the overall composition of the

00:15:51.232 --> 00:15:55.431
circulatory system,
let's think about a very simple

00:15:55.431 --> 00:16:00.202
problem that engineers have
thought about for hundreds of

00:16:00.202 --> 00:16:02.878
years now.
Turns out to have a lot of

00:16:02.878 --> 00:16:06.255
relevance in the cardiovascular
system, but has relevance

00:16:06.255 --> 00:16:09.340
everywhere.
It has relevance in terms of

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.419
getting water to all the faucets
in this building.

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:18.317
You have to solve the same
problem, and that is generating

00:16:18.317 --> 00:16:23.214
enough pressure to allow fluid
to move through a length of

00:16:23.214 --> 00:16:25.929
tubing.
We'll think about a typical

00:16:25.929 --> 00:16:29.730
length of tubing and we'll make
it as simple as possible.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:33.885
It's a vessel that has a
constant diameter or radius and

00:16:33.885 --> 00:16:37.030
a known length.
Fluid is going to flow in one

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.558
end of this vessel and it's
going to flow out the other,

00:16:40.558 --> 00:16:43.830
and this is called internal
flow through a tube.

00:16:43.830 --> 00:16:47.561
Turns out to be one of the
most well studied problems in

00:16:47.561 --> 00:16:50.533
all of engineering;
I'm just going to tell you one

00:16:50.533 --> 00:16:53.744
aspect of this.
Over a certain range of flow

00:16:53.744 --> 00:16:58.578
rates--so this isn't true all
the time but it's going to be

00:16:58.578 --> 00:17:02.830
true most of the time in our
circulatory system.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:05.562
If I try to generate a flow
through this tube,

00:17:05.562 --> 00:17:09.144
and the flow again is going to
be measured in something like

00:17:09.144 --> 00:17:11.907
volume per minute,
so let's say 1L/min,

00:17:11.907 --> 00:17:16.190
then the pressure that I need
to produce the pressure drop,

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:20.930
meaning, 'What's the pressure
difference from one side of the

00:17:20.930 --> 00:17:24.485
tube to the other?'
I don't care about absolute

00:17:24.485 --> 00:17:28.030
pressure I only care about a
difference in pressure between

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.584
one side and the other.
That difference in pressure is

00:17:31.584 --> 00:17:35.578
proportional to the rate of flow
and that's what this equation

00:17:35.578 --> 00:17:39.014
says here.
If I knew what the pressure

00:17:39.014 --> 00:17:43.608
drop was the flow is
proportional to that and the

00:17:43.608 --> 00:17:47.819
constant of proportionality is
this symbol R,

00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:52.884
the resistance to flow.
We say that ΔP,

00:17:52.884 --> 00:17:59.559
the drop in pressure over the
tubing is equal to R x flow

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:04.909
rate, ΔP = R x Q.
ΔP is a driving force,

00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:08.244
pressure difference is a
driving force,

00:18:08.244 --> 00:18:14.281
it's what causes the flow.
The flow is what results from

00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:19.750
that, so ΔP = RQ.
Does that kind of equation

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:24.880
look familiar to anybody from
their high school physics?

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.620
Have you ever seen an equation
like that?

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:40.372
ΔP = RQ--driving force is
equal to some constant times a

00:18:40.372 --> 00:18:41.570
flow.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:56.271
Ever seen ΔV = RI?
Anybody know where that

00:18:56.271 --> 00:18:56.930
equation comes from?

00:19:02.559 --> 00:19:03.909
Student:
[inaudible]Professor

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:05.112
Mark Saltzman:
Circuits--it's the flow

00:19:05.112 --> 00:19:07.463
through an electrical circuit.
What's the potential for flow

00:19:07.463 --> 00:19:10.546
through an electrical circuit?
It's a driving force,

00:19:10.546 --> 00:19:14.833
it's a voltage driving force,
you hook up a battery to a

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:17.250
length of wire,
for example.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:22.259
What flows is electrons
current, and how much flows

00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:28.269
through wire--how much flows
through a circuit in response to

00:19:28.269 --> 00:19:33.780
a voltage change depends on a
property of the wire,

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.151
its resistance.
Thicker wires,

00:19:37.151 --> 00:19:41.236
more cross-section has less
resistance, you can flow more

00:19:41.236 --> 00:19:44.300
current through it,
thinner wires less.

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:50.646
It takes more--for a given
driving force,

00:19:50.646 --> 00:19:53.809
for a given voltage less
current flows.

00:19:53.809 --> 00:19:56.210
If you haven't seen that before
don't worry about it.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.555
If you have seen it then
hopefully this will be useful in

00:19:59.555 --> 00:20:02.635
thinking about this.
Which is the same thing,

00:20:02.635 --> 00:20:07.269
that the pressure drop produces
as flow and how much you produce

00:20:07.269 --> 00:20:11.462
for a given pressure drop
depends on a property called the

00:20:11.462 --> 00:20:14.517
resistance.
Now the resistance is a

00:20:14.517 --> 00:20:17.299
property of the geometry of the
vessel.

00:20:17.299 --> 00:20:21.343
If I have a very--a vessel with
a very large diameter for a

00:20:21.343 --> 00:20:24.690
given pressure drop I can create
a large flow.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:29.770
For a vessel with a small
diameter, for that same pressure

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:33.347
drop I get less flow.
Imagine your--whatever your

00:20:33.347 --> 00:20:36.288
favorite beverage is,
think about a milkshake because

00:20:36.288 --> 00:20:38.890
those are difficult to draw
through straws.

00:20:38.890 --> 00:20:42.307
If you're going to drink a
milkshake in your favorite

00:20:42.307 --> 00:20:45.658
flavor, do you hope you get a
narrow straw or a big,

00:20:45.658 --> 00:20:48.310
thick straw?
You would not pick the narrow

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:51.510
straw if you really like the
milkshake because you can only

00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:54.380
generate a certain pressure drop
with your mouth.

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:57.031
If you generate that pressure
drop you're not going to get

00:20:57.031 --> 00:20:59.031
much milkshake,
you're not going to get much

00:20:59.031 --> 00:21:01.580
flow.
If I have a bigger tube,

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:04.332
same pressure drop,
bigger flow,

00:21:04.332 --> 00:21:08.084
more milkshake.
Here the resistance,

00:21:08.084 --> 00:21:11.945
it turns out,
we can for very simple vessels

00:21:11.945 --> 00:21:17.512
like this, the resistance can be
related to the geometry of the

00:21:17.512 --> 00:21:20.261
vessel.
That is, if I told you what

00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:24.039
shape this vessel was how--what
it's diameter was and how long

00:21:24.039 --> 00:21:27.940
it is you can calculate what the
resistance is from this formula

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.070
here,
R =

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:34.174
8µL/πr^(4). Now
you know what all these things

00:21:34.174 --> 00:21:35.670
are,
you know what π

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:40.400
is, that's 3.14--π
is familiar;

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.080
r is the radius;
L is the length.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.950
What's µ?
µ is a property of

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.980
the fluid and it's the
viscosity.

00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:56.240
Milkshakes have high viscosity,
water has a low viscosity.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.572
So, if you're going to drink
water you're not so worried

00:21:59.572 --> 00:22:03.205
about how big your straw is.
You would accept a small straw

00:22:03.205 --> 00:22:06.109
not just because milkshakes are
more delicious,

00:22:06.109 --> 00:22:09.269
but because you don't need to
generate as much of a pressure

00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:12.000
drop to move water as you do to
move a milkshake,

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.700
because milkshakes have a
higher viscosity.

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:18.652
The viscosity of the blood is
in general a constant,

00:22:18.652 --> 00:22:22.140
it's a constant that is about 3
centipoise.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.848
You can read in the book about
units of viscosity and how

00:22:25.848 --> 00:22:29.468
they're defined.
It tells you something about

00:22:29.468 --> 00:22:34.759
the force that you need in order
to cause the fluid to flow.

00:22:34.759 --> 00:22:37.404
We're going to be dealing
with fluids in here that are

00:22:37.404 --> 00:22:39.259
basically constant in their
viscosity.

00:22:39.259 --> 00:22:43.369
Blood is about three times as
viscous as water.

00:22:43.369 --> 00:22:50.220
Why is blood more viscous than
water, why is it harder to flow?

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:52.297
It's largely water,
it's mostly water,

00:22:52.297 --> 00:22:55.273
that's the major component,
why isn't the viscosity of

00:22:55.273 --> 00:22:57.800
blood the same as the viscosity
of water?

00:23:02.650 --> 00:23:04.133
Student:
[Inaudible]Professor Mark

00:23:04.133 --> 00:23:05.733
Saltzman: It has molecules
in it and so that makes a

00:23:05.733 --> 00:23:08.692
difference.
It also has something else,

00:23:08.692 --> 00:23:12.150
50% of the volume of blood is
cells.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:16.984
A concentrated solution of
cells, like red blood cells,

00:23:16.984 --> 00:23:22.535
is not as easy to flow as water
is, so that's why water is more

00:23:22.535 --> 00:23:25.093
viscous.
If you wanted to then think

00:23:25.093 --> 00:23:27.839
about how much flow there is
through this vessel,

00:23:27.839 --> 00:23:29.982
and I told you what the
dimensions were,

00:23:29.982 --> 00:23:32.180
and I told you that blood was
flowing,

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.599
you could calculate r
and then you would know

00:23:35.599 --> 00:23:38.549
everything about flow through
this vessel.

00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:43.267
You would know if I have a
pressure drop of so many units,

00:23:43.267 --> 00:23:46.329
this is the flow that would
result.

00:23:46.329 --> 00:23:49.212
Justin?Student:
[Inaudible]Professor Mark

00:23:49.212 --> 00:23:52.094
Saltzman: The interior
surface of the tube could make a

00:23:52.094 --> 00:23:54.939
difference.
Now it turns out for low flows,

00:23:54.939 --> 00:23:57.918
surprisingly,
the surface of the tube doesn't

00:23:57.918 --> 00:24:02.319
make a difference if the flow
rate is a below a certain level.

00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:05.000
You're thinking about,
'What if the surface of the

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.731
tube is rough?'
Then, fluid that's flowing past

00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:10.985
that surface is going to
experience more friction than if

00:24:10.985 --> 00:24:13.599
it was flowing past a very
smooth surface.

00:24:13.599 --> 00:24:18.841
At low flow rates the friction
that occurs when a liquid meets

00:24:18.841 --> 00:24:24.254
a solid is so high that fluid at
the surface doesn't really move

00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:25.943
at all.
For low rates,

00:24:25.943 --> 00:24:28.756
fluid that's right at the
surface doesn't move at all,

00:24:28.756 --> 00:24:32.099
and so roughness doesn't matter
when you have no flow there.

00:24:32.099 --> 00:24:35.712
As the flow rate increases then
roughness becomes more

00:24:35.712 --> 00:24:37.937
important.
Two things about it in our

00:24:37.937 --> 00:24:40.047
vascular systems,
the flow rates are generally

00:24:40.047 --> 00:24:42.440
low enough that you don't have
worry about that.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:49.904
Our vessels are all really very
similar in terms of their

00:24:49.904 --> 00:24:54.754
microscopic geometry,
and that all of the blood

00:24:54.754 --> 00:24:58.393
vessels are covered with a
monolayer of cells called

00:24:58.393 --> 00:25:02.817
endothelial cells that basically
form a blanket over the entire

00:25:02.817 --> 00:25:06.599
surface of the inside of the
circulatory system.

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:09.770
There's very little frictional
resistance to flow.

00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:11.840
That's a really good point.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.413
Other questions?
Okay, so this equation sort

00:25:19.413 --> 00:25:20.869
of makes sense,
right?

00:25:20.869 --> 00:25:23.829
If you go on to study
Biomedical Engineering you'll

00:25:23.829 --> 00:25:27.144
learn exactly where this
equation comes from and you'd be

00:25:27.144 --> 00:25:31.542
able to derive it yourself.
For now, just accept it and it

00:25:31.542 --> 00:25:35.472
is true for almost all the
vessels in our body,

00:25:35.472 --> 00:25:39.829
under all the circumstances of
human physiology.

00:25:39.829 --> 00:25:43.436
It tells us that resistance
varies with viscosity,

00:25:43.436 --> 00:25:47.484
length, and radius and it
varies in kind of the way that

00:25:47.484 --> 00:25:51.130
you would expect.
As viscosity of the fluid goes

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.769
up resistance goes up,
as the length of the tube goes

00:25:54.769 --> 00:25:58.380
up, resistance goes up;
harder to pull through a long

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:00.480
straw than through a short
straw.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.183
As the radius goes up
resistance goes down,

00:26:04.183 --> 00:26:08.151
because the radius is in the
denominator here,

00:26:08.151 --> 00:26:12.559
so as radius goes up the
resistance goes down.

00:26:12.559 --> 00:26:17.337
Remarkably,
the resistance goes with the

00:26:17.337 --> 00:26:21.829
fourth power of the radius.
What does that mean?

00:26:21.829 --> 00:26:26.326
That means a 2-fold increase in
radius leads to a 16-fold

00:26:26.326 --> 00:26:27.290
reduction.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:36.049
A 16-fold reduction in
resistance;

00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:38.838
so resistance is,
of all the parameters,

00:26:38.838 --> 00:26:41.769
resistance is most sensitive to
radius.

00:26:41.769 --> 00:26:44.757
Caitlin, did you have a
question?Student:

00:26:44.757 --> 00:26:47.920
[Inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: Yeah.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.619
So what's the unit here?
Well let's think of it.

00:26:51.619 --> 00:26:55.670
What unit would you measure
pressure in?

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:01.430
What's a unit of pressure?
Pascals (Pa) is one;

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:13.340
Newtons per millimeters squared
(N/m^(2)), so its force per area

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:18.770
is pressure.
What's a more commonly--those

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:24.366
are great units--sorry?
Pounds per square inch is

00:27:24.366 --> 00:27:25.990
another unit,
PSI.

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:29.390
What's the pressure in the room
here?

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:33.711
1 Atmosphere (atm);
atmosphere is another pressure,

00:27:33.711 --> 00:27:39.929
so relative to atmospheric
pressure and if you have a--any

00:27:39.929 --> 00:27:42.519
others?
Millimeters of mercury (mmHg);

00:27:42.519 --> 00:27:46.360
it turns out that all of those
are proper units for pressure

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.265
and you could convert between
one or the other as long as you

00:27:50.265 --> 00:27:54.040
knew what the conversion factor
was between the--we usually

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:57.359
atmospheres to describe
Atmospheric Pressure.

00:27:57.359 --> 00:28:01.323
Physiologists usually use
millimeters of mercury to

00:28:01.323 --> 00:28:04.970
describe pressure in the
circulatory system.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:10.967
So, 1 atm is 760 mmHg.
What are the blood

00:28:10.967 --> 00:28:15.289
pressures that are relevant in
your circulatory system?

00:28:15.289 --> 00:28:18.789
How many millimeters of mercury
do you think?

00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:20.880
Anybody know what their blood
pressure is?

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.912
120/80 what?
They don't tell you that--120

00:28:31.912 --> 00:28:36.436
mmHg over 80 mmHg.
We're going to talk about where

00:28:36.436 --> 00:28:41.043
those numbers--where those
pressures actually exist in a

00:28:41.043 --> 00:28:46.403
few minutes but that's the range
of pressures in your circulatory

00:28:46.403 --> 00:28:49.670
system from 0 mmHg up to 120
mmHg;

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.650
roughly and we'll see you go
outside that range sometimes.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:56.394
Now these are pressures
that are inside our circulatory

00:28:56.394 --> 00:28:59.945
system so they must be--but
they're only a fraction of 1

00:28:59.945 --> 00:29:03.076
atm, how can that be?
An atm is 760 mmHg,

00:29:03.076 --> 00:29:05.789
that's the pressure in this
room.

00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:12.019
If your blood pressure is
120/80 what does that mean?

00:29:12.019 --> 00:29:17.460
Well, pressure is--we only care
about differences in pressure.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:20.511
It's relative pressure that
matters not the absolute

00:29:20.511 --> 00:29:23.288
pressure.
When you say your blood

00:29:23.288 --> 00:29:28.630
pressure is 120/80 that means
120 mmHg above Atmospheric;

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:35.844
80 mmHg above Atmospheric.
Otherwise our blood vessels

00:29:35.844 --> 00:29:40.871
would collapse because we're
surrounded by air that's 760

00:29:40.871 --> 00:29:43.695
mmHg,
that to inflate those vessels

00:29:43.695 --> 00:29:46.599
you have to be at pressures
above that.

00:29:46.599 --> 00:29:50.293
Since all we care about are
pressure differences then the

00:29:50.293 --> 00:29:54.185
pressure that you measure when
you measure blood pressure is

00:29:54.185 --> 00:29:59.190
pressure above Atmospheric.
Does that make sense?

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:06.789
ΔP is in mmHg,
Q is in L/min,

00:30:06.789 --> 00:30:14.849
so R is in units of
mmHg/(L/min).

00:30:14.849 --> 00:30:25.072
It's in units of--if we just
write this out mmHg= R,

00:30:25.072 --> 00:30:33.892
and this is L/min,
then R must be in units of

00:30:33.892 --> 00:30:37.300
mmHg/(L/min).

00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:52.864
This resistance changes,
it changes with geometry,

00:30:52.864 --> 00:30:57.279
the most sensitive thing that
changes is the radius.

00:30:57.279 --> 00:31:02.068
Imagine if you had a vessel
that could change its radius,

00:31:02.068 --> 00:31:06.430
that could become smaller or
could become larger.

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:11.800
Then, that would be a vessel
that could regulate its

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.706
resistance.
If that vessel was faced with a

00:31:15.706 --> 00:31:19.388
pressure drop,
let's say a pressure drop of 10

00:31:19.388 --> 00:31:23.480
mmHg from beginning to end of
this vessel here,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:28.491
and it could change its radius
then it could change the amount

00:31:28.491 --> 00:31:32.639
of blood flow through it.
If it decreased its radius,

00:31:32.639 --> 00:31:36.926
the rate of blood flow would go
down even though the pressure

00:31:36.926 --> 00:31:40.611
drop stays the same.
If it expanded its radius,

00:31:40.611 --> 00:31:45.009
the rate of low would go up
even though the pressure drop

00:31:45.009 --> 00:31:48.990
remains the same.
Does that make sense?

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.597
I mentioned before that
arteries, arterioles,

00:31:52.597 --> 00:31:55.678
small arteries,
all arteries have muscular

00:31:55.678 --> 00:31:57.997
walls.
They have a special kind of

00:31:57.997 --> 00:32:00.551
muscle called smooth muscle
which is arranged

00:32:00.551 --> 00:32:03.960
circumferentially,
sort of wrapped around the

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:08.930
vessel, and that muscle can
contract to constrict the vessel

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:14.164
or relax to dilate the vessel.
One feature of arteries that

00:32:14.164 --> 00:32:18.548
makes them important in
physiology is that they can

00:32:18.548 --> 00:32:22.625
change their diameter.
When they change their diameter

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:26.152
they change their resistance,
and they change the flow that

00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:28.950
goes through them at a fixed
pressure drop.

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:34.537
Why is that important?
Well, let's say you get up and

00:32:34.537 --> 00:32:36.030
you start running;

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:41.665
lecture's over,
you're excited to tell your

00:32:41.665 --> 00:32:44.157
friends about it,
so you get up and you run out

00:32:44.157 --> 00:32:46.920
of class, and you went from
resting to running.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:51.076
Now, all of a sudden your
muscles need more blood because

00:32:51.076 --> 00:32:54.119
they're going to start
generating work.

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:59.398
The blood--the arteries that
feed your muscles are going to

00:32:59.398 --> 00:33:03.693
contract--are going to relax.
The diameter will get bigger,

00:33:03.693 --> 00:33:06.690
the pressure available is the
same, they'll get more flow.

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:10.190
That flow has to come from
somewhere so simultaneously

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:14.059
other vessels are constricting.
What would those vessels be?

00:33:14.059 --> 00:33:16.826
Well, probably the vessels that
go to non-essential functions

00:33:16.826 --> 00:33:19.213
when you're starting to run.
Not your brain,

00:33:19.213 --> 00:33:23.363
you want to keep blood flow to
your brain so you don't run into

00:33:23.363 --> 00:33:26.777
the wall, but you might have
less flow going to your

00:33:26.777 --> 00:33:29.946
digestive organs.
You'd stop digestion for some

00:33:29.946 --> 00:33:34.484
period or slow it down;
provide less blood flow for

00:33:34.484 --> 00:33:37.559
that purpose.
Does that make sense?

00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:41.655
Well if we look at how
pressure varies through the

00:33:41.655 --> 00:33:44.823
circulatory system,
your blood pressure is

00:33:44.823 --> 00:33:50.024
generated by the heart.
Blood pressure ranges between

00:33:50.024 --> 00:33:52.972
120/80 mmHg.
We're going to see this in a

00:33:52.972 --> 00:33:56.243
few minutes but those numbers
represent the maximum pressure

00:33:56.243 --> 00:33:58.849
and the minimum pressure during
a heartbeat.

00:33:58.849 --> 00:34:01.533
The maximum pressure occurs
when the heart is actively

00:34:01.533 --> 00:34:04.856
contracting or beating.
We'll talk about that more in a

00:34:04.856 --> 00:34:08.504
few minutes and we'll talk about
that in great detail on

00:34:08.504 --> 00:34:11.167
Thursday.
Then it drops when the heart is

00:34:11.167 --> 00:34:14.070
relaxing.
Blood pressure is generated in

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:17.750
a cyclic fashion because of
beating of the heart,

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.203
contract, relax,
contract, relax,

00:34:20.203 --> 00:34:22.349
120,80, 120,80,
120,80.

00:34:22.349 --> 00:34:25.639
That pressure of 120/80 gets
transmitted to the aorta.

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:32.001
The pressure in the aorta is
roughly the same as it is in the

00:34:32.001 --> 00:34:34.000
heart.
Now why is that?

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.050
Why isn't there a pressure drop
through the aorta?

00:34:36.050 --> 00:34:38.679
Well there is a pressure drop
through the aorta but it's very

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:41.343
small.
The reason it's small is that

00:34:41.343 --> 00:34:45.834
the aorta is big;
has a large diameter and so

00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:51.660
it's resistance is low.
In order to generate 5L/min of

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:55.289
flow you don't need much
pressure.

00:34:55.289 --> 00:34:58.362
In order to--even this whopping
flow that goes through the

00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:00.949
aorta, because of the large size
of the aorta,

00:35:00.949 --> 00:35:04.519
you don't need much pressure
drop to generate that flow.

00:35:04.519 --> 00:35:06.769
If I measured pressure drop
over the aorta,

00:35:06.769 --> 00:35:09.179
from the beginning to the end
of the aorta,

00:35:09.179 --> 00:35:12.206
I'd find that pressure doesn't
really change very much and

00:35:12.206 --> 00:35:14.489
that's what's shown in this
diagram here.

00:35:14.489 --> 00:35:18.523
As I move from the beginning of
the aorta to the end there must

00:35:18.523 --> 00:35:22.350
be some drop in pressure.
Has to be, otherwise blood

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:26.969
wouldn't flow at all but there's
not very much of a drop.

00:35:26.969 --> 00:35:29.946
Similarly,
the large arteries would still

00:35:29.946 --> 00:35:32.989
have large diameters,
have low resistances.

00:35:32.989 --> 00:35:35.956
Doesn't take much pressure to
move a flow rate through those

00:35:35.956 --> 00:35:38.018
large arteries,
so over the large arteries

00:35:38.018 --> 00:35:40.130
there's not much pressure drop
either.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.841
This would be the branches,
like the main branch that goes

00:35:42.841 --> 00:35:45.600
to your arm, the branch that
goes to the carotids that goes

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.623
up to your brain,
the branch that goes down to

00:35:47.623 --> 00:35:48.940
your leg called the femoral
artery.

00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:51.355
Still large arteries,
large diameter,

00:35:51.355 --> 00:35:55.179
not much pressure drop needed
to generate a large flow.

00:35:55.179 --> 00:35:58.709
As we move to more
branches, smaller and smaller

00:35:58.709 --> 00:36:01.340
vessels, it turns out at some
point,

00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:06.202
and the point at which this
occurs is the arterioles,

00:36:06.202 --> 00:36:11.344
the diameter has gotten small
enough that the resistance

00:36:11.344 --> 00:36:16.019
becomes significant compared to
the flow rate.

00:36:16.019 --> 00:36:20.805
Now, there's so many branches
that occurred before this that

00:36:20.805 --> 00:36:24.780
these individual vessels aren't
getting 5L/min,

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.019
they're only getting some small
fraction of that.

00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:30.435
There might be 1,000 of these
arterioles, let's say,

00:36:30.435 --> 00:36:33.230
and so they're all getting
1/1,000th of the maximum flow.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:38.000
How could that pressure drop be
more?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.217
How come they need a big
pressure drop,

00:36:40.217 --> 00:36:42.260
which is what's illustrated
here.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:46.648
It takes a substantial drop in
pressure in order to move this

00:36:46.648 --> 00:36:50.160
lower flow rate through these
smaller vessels.

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.357
How could that be?
Well remember that the

00:36:54.357 --> 00:36:57.510
resistance changed with
r^(4).

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:02.072
That means that as the radius
goes down it's not a linear

00:37:02.072 --> 00:37:06.960
relationship between the radius
going down and the resistance

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.165
going up,
it's a 4^(th)-power

00:37:09.165 --> 00:37:12.758
relationship.
As it gets small resistance

00:37:12.758 --> 00:37:16.219
starts to become very,
very high.

00:37:16.219 --> 00:37:20.544
When you divide a flow between
vessels that's kind of a linear

00:37:20.544 --> 00:37:24.283
process, it goes two ways,
it goes four ways,

00:37:24.283 --> 00:37:29.545
it goes eight--but this
r^(4) starts to dominate

00:37:29.545 --> 00:37:33.539
when you get down to a certain
radius.

00:37:33.539 --> 00:37:36.500
It turns out that that's at the
level of the arterioles.

00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.574
Most of the pressure drop on
this side of your--on this left

00:37:40.574 --> 00:37:43.059
side of the cardiovascular
system,

00:37:43.059 --> 00:37:45.540
most of the pressure drop
occurs at the level of the

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.004
r^(4).
There's a significant pressure

00:37:48.004 --> 00:37:51.414
drop through the arteries and
then not much pressure drop at

00:37:51.414 --> 00:37:54.704
all through the veins.
The veins are low pressure

00:37:54.704 --> 00:37:58.179
vessels, generally large in
diameter, and not much

00:37:58.179 --> 00:38:01.899
resistance to flow.
Now why--if you were going

00:38:01.899 --> 00:38:05.786
to design a system like this,
is there any advantage to

00:38:05.786 --> 00:38:10.250
having the largest pressure drop
occur over the arterioles,

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:13.498
or the largest relative
resistance occurring over the

00:38:13.498 --> 00:38:16.814
arterioles?
Well, there's a huge advantage

00:38:16.814 --> 00:38:21.655
because wherever the pressure
drop occurs, that's the place

00:38:21.655 --> 00:38:26.079
where you have the best
opportunity to adjust the flow

00:38:26.079 --> 00:38:30.837
because small changes in radius
are going to lead to large

00:38:30.837 --> 00:38:34.010
changes in relative resistance.

00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:42.462
It's at the arterioles,
or the very smallest arteries

00:38:42.462 --> 00:38:47.984
that are supplying blood to our
tissues, where we have the most

00:38:47.984 --> 00:38:51.832
control over flow rate.
That makes sense because

00:38:51.832 --> 00:38:55.260
sometimes you're not making big
movements in blood flow,

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.991
like saying,
'I want very little blood flow

00:38:57.991 --> 00:39:01.894
to my gut and a lot of blood
flow to my muscle'--that's a big

00:39:01.894 --> 00:39:04.841
change.
You're making smaller changes

00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:07.943
within a tissue;
like, 'I want more blood to go

00:39:07.943 --> 00:39:11.711
to the region of my brain that's
involved in talking and less to

00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:14.940
the region in my brain that's
involved in reading.'

00:39:18.219 --> 00:39:21.407
When you're talking versus
reading you want to regulate

00:39:21.407 --> 00:39:24.239
where the blood flows on a more
smaller scale,

00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:27.884
on the scale of a tissue,
and its arterioleswhich are

00:39:27.884 --> 00:39:32.159
branching within tissues that
have the capacity to do that.

00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:35.531
You could do something like
this, let's say this is a very

00:39:35.531 --> 00:39:37.852
imaginary situation,
but I drew it just for

00:39:37.852 --> 00:39:41.164
illustrative purposes.
Let's say that this was an

00:39:41.164 --> 00:39:45.416
artery that was feeding some
tissue and so there was a blood

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:50.030
flow that's coming in here and
it splits five different ways.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:54.092
So, here are five different
regions of the tissue that are

00:39:54.092 --> 00:39:58.033
served by these arterioles.
Now, I could draw this--one of

00:39:58.033 --> 00:40:01.468
the nice things if you do know
this analogy between this

00:40:01.468 --> 00:40:05.215
equation describing pressure
drop flow relationships and this

00:40:05.215 --> 00:40:08.650
equation describing voltage
current relationships,

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:12.796
is that you could draw a
diagram for pressure flow

00:40:12.796 --> 00:40:16.253
relationships.
It looks just like a circuit

00:40:16.253 --> 00:40:19.559
diagram because the equations
are the same.

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:25.014
That's what I've done here
is taken this anatomical

00:40:25.014 --> 00:40:29.155
picture, cartoon,
and converted it into an

00:40:29.155 --> 00:40:35.619
equivalent circuit where I'm not
thinking about flow of electrons

00:40:35.619 --> 00:40:38.866
now or current,
I'm thinking about flow of

00:40:38.866 --> 00:40:40.799
fluid.
I'm drawing a resistance not as

00:40:40.799 --> 00:40:43.480
an electrical resistance but as
a flow resistance;

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:48.233
as this kind of a resistance.
Let's say that the blood is

00:40:48.233 --> 00:40:51.828
flowing in at a rate of 100
mm/min and that the resistance

00:40:51.828 --> 00:40:54.926
here is one unit,
and the resistance here on each

00:40:54.926 --> 00:40:57.829
of these smaller segments is
smaller--or higher.

00:40:57.829 --> 00:41:01.064
These are smaller--it branches
into smaller vessels so they

00:41:01.064 --> 00:41:04.651
have a higher resistance,
and it's five units here and

00:41:04.651 --> 00:41:07.550
one unit here and the units are
these.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:12.831
Well, if all the resistances
are the same then the--of the

00:41:12.831 --> 00:41:18.205
blood that flows in here it's
going to flow equally through

00:41:18.205 --> 00:41:22.384
each one of these tubes,
and so basically this 100

00:41:22.384 --> 00:41:24.730
mm/min of flow gets split five
ways.

00:41:31.059 --> 00:41:32.769
You could do this
calculation yourself;

00:41:32.769 --> 00:41:36.100
the pressure drop here is just
1 mmHg and if you did this

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.360
calculation it should work out
okay,

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:44.469
the total resistance of this
circuit with 1 mmHg gives you

00:41:44.469 --> 00:41:49.878
100 mm/min of flow.
What if one of these vessels

00:41:49.878 --> 00:41:53.919
changes its diameter?
Let's say it's this one and

00:41:53.919 --> 00:41:57.443
let's say that it shrinks its
diameter so this resistance goes

00:41:57.443 --> 00:42:00.038
up.
Goes up here from five units to

00:42:00.038 --> 00:42:03.013
100 units, so I made a big
change in that,

00:42:03.013 --> 00:42:07.293
goes up by a factor of 20 so
that would be about a factor of

00:42:07.293 --> 00:42:13.599
two difference in radius,
because of the 4^(th)-power.

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:16.695
If this one goes up to 100 now
there's more resistance through

00:42:16.695 --> 00:42:19.638
this particular vessel here and
the same resistance through

00:42:19.638 --> 00:42:21.389
these three,
so what happens?

00:42:21.389 --> 00:42:28.171
Less flow goes through this
vessel and the same flow goes

00:42:28.171 --> 00:42:33.984
through the others,
so that the total flow now is

00:42:33.984 --> 00:42:37.264
89 mm/min.
Now why did the total--you

00:42:37.264 --> 00:42:40.750
could understand sort of because
that's pretty obvious right why,

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:44.168
when I decreased the radius and
increased the resistance of this

00:42:44.168 --> 00:42:47.044
vessel, why less flow went
through it than through its

00:42:47.044 --> 00:42:49.420
partners,
that kind of makes sense.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:53.035
You've got a smaller vessel so
now I've got four large vessels

00:42:53.035 --> 00:42:55.779
and one smaller one,
and if I feed them with the

00:42:55.779 --> 00:42:59.031
same pressure drop more of the
flow is going to go through the

00:42:59.031 --> 00:43:01.909
big vessels because there's
least resistance there.

00:43:01.909 --> 00:43:04.785
Fluid takes the path of least
resistance, some goes through

00:43:04.785 --> 00:43:06.570
but not as much,
that makes sense.

00:43:06.570 --> 00:43:09.732
Why does the overall flow
through the whole circuit

00:43:09.732 --> 00:43:12.397
change?
Why does the overall flow

00:43:12.397 --> 00:43:17.202
through this whole thing change?
Well, because if any one of the

00:43:17.202 --> 00:43:20.782
vessels in here increases its
resistance it increases the

00:43:20.782 --> 00:43:23.980
overall resistance of the
aggregate of vessels.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:26.936
If the pressure that I have
available is constant,

00:43:26.936 --> 00:43:30.496
and it is, the pressure I have
available is constant in this

00:43:30.496 --> 00:43:32.111
example,
it's 1 mmHg,

00:43:32.111 --> 00:43:36.122
then when the whole thing
increases its resistance that

00:43:36.122 --> 00:43:40.727
means the flow rate through the
whole circuit has to go down as

00:43:40.727 --> 00:43:42.643
well.
There's two things that are

00:43:42.643 --> 00:43:46.004
really illustrated here.
One is that you could regulate

00:43:46.004 --> 00:43:50.753
in pathways that are competing
with each other for flow then

00:43:50.753 --> 00:43:55.502
the relative resistance between
equal members determines how

00:43:55.502 --> 00:44:00.230
much flow goes to each vessel;
that's one thing that's

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:02.702
illustrated.
The other is that the

00:44:02.702 --> 00:44:06.547
whole--the flow through this
whole piece of the circulatory

00:44:06.547 --> 00:44:09.475
system,
this whole part of the network,

00:44:09.475 --> 00:44:13.860
depends on the resistance of
every single vessel within it.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.438
One vessel changing its
resistance changes the whole

00:44:17.438 --> 00:44:19.987
thing.
That's a feature of our

00:44:19.987 --> 00:44:23.025
circulatory system.
If I want more blood to go to

00:44:23.025 --> 00:44:26.210
the brain there's two ways to
get more blood to the brain.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.570
Well, there's more than two
ways, but two ways as long as

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:32.329
the pressure--blood pressure
stays the same.

00:44:32.329 --> 00:44:36.096
One way is to dilate the
vessels of the brain to create

00:44:36.096 --> 00:44:39.601
less resistance there.
The other way is to constrict

00:44:39.601 --> 00:44:43.389
the vessels somewhere else to
create more resistance there.

00:44:43.389 --> 00:44:47.980
Either one of those is going to
get me more flow to the brain.

00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:52.867
Because it's a closed system,
everything is interconnected

00:44:52.867 --> 00:44:57.326
and a change in flow in one
place can influence flows

00:44:57.326 --> 00:45:01.070
throughout the whole system.
Does this make sense?

00:45:04.239 --> 00:45:07.215
I want to go back to this
picture, now,

00:45:07.215 --> 00:45:11.039
and talk about what we've
learned in terms of flows.

00:45:11.039 --> 00:45:13.955
Now you can think about this in
a little bit different way,

00:45:13.955 --> 00:45:16.570
that if there's flows going
through here and here,

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:21.337
how much goes each direction,
depends on the relative

00:45:21.337 --> 00:45:25.829
resistance between this vessel
and this vessel.

00:45:25.829 --> 00:45:29.382
It does depend on the relative
size between this vessel and

00:45:29.382 --> 00:45:33.056
this vessel, but it depends on
the relative resistance of the

00:45:33.056 --> 00:45:36.406
whole network after it as well.
It depends on the whole

00:45:36.406 --> 00:45:38.713
resistance--even if you have a
big tube here,

00:45:38.713 --> 00:45:41.860
if it's feeding lots of very
constricted tubes down here,

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:45.304
the overall resistance that the
fluid experiences at this branch

00:45:45.304 --> 00:45:47.820
point is going to be high in
this direction.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:54.670
The whole--the resistance of
the whole circuit matters.

00:45:58.460 --> 00:46:05.322
Think about that.Let's now
think about what's driving this

00:46:05.322 --> 00:46:07.860
flow.
That is, what's generating the

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.126
pressure and you know that
what's generating the pressure

00:46:11.126 --> 00:46:13.877
is the heart.
That's the only place where

00:46:13.877 --> 00:46:17.309
pressure gets generated within
this closed system.

00:46:17.309 --> 00:46:20.298
The pressure that's generated
by the heart,

00:46:20.298 --> 00:46:24.068
which is experienced by the
aorta, is what drives flow

00:46:24.068 --> 00:46:28.642
throughout all of these vessels.
The only opportunity that

00:46:28.642 --> 00:46:33.713
individual vessels out here have
to adjust how much flow goes to

00:46:33.713 --> 00:46:38.059
them is by changing their
diameters, which they do.

00:46:38.059 --> 00:46:41.712
The only way to change the
overall rate of flow is to

00:46:41.712 --> 00:46:45.997
change the overall pressure drop
which can only be done by the

00:46:45.997 --> 00:46:48.519
heart.
How does the heart work?

00:46:48.519 --> 00:46:52.234
Well let me just start this and
then we'll talk about this in

00:46:52.234 --> 00:46:57.309
much more detail next time.
This is a picture of the heart.

00:46:57.309 --> 00:47:01.496
It sits--about the size of your
fist, basically in the center of

00:47:01.496 --> 00:47:05.550
your chest, but shifted a little
bit to the left hand side.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:08.300
You can find out where yours
are by just putting a finger

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.757
there and feeling where you can
feel the heartbeat,

00:47:10.757 --> 00:47:14.017
it's fairly easy to define.
The apex of the heart,

00:47:14.017 --> 00:47:18.598
the tip of it sits downward
like that and the major vessels

00:47:18.598 --> 00:47:22.317
are near the center line;
so the tip is down here,

00:47:22.317 --> 00:47:25.080
the major vessels are near the
center line.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:30.167
The heart has muscular walls.
The walls of the heart are

00:47:30.167 --> 00:47:33.949
called the myocardium,
muscle heart.

00:47:33.949 --> 00:47:38.021
'Myo' is muscle,
'cardium' is heart and there's

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:42.269
muscular walls so it's a big
muscle basically.

00:47:42.269 --> 00:47:45.233
There are blood vessels on
the surface and so this is the

00:47:45.233 --> 00:47:48.358
aorta coming up here.
Where this arrow is here is the

00:47:48.358 --> 00:47:51.951
aorta, this is the aortic arch,
and then goes down to the

00:47:51.951 --> 00:47:55.400
abdomen and up to the brain.
These are those coronary

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.469
vessels that I mentioned
earlier.

00:47:57.469 --> 00:48:00.982
The first branches off of the
aorta are to these coronary

00:48:00.982 --> 00:48:04.369
arteries which branch over the
surface of the heart,

00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:07.079
so now you can see this
branching pattern more clearly

00:48:07.079 --> 00:48:10.127
in one particular tissue.
Here's a coronary artery the

00:48:10.127 --> 00:48:12.272
blood flows through,
here's a branch,

00:48:12.272 --> 00:48:16.320
one goes more to the left,
one goes more down the center

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.199
line, branches again,
branches again,

00:48:19.199 --> 00:48:23.679
and by continuously branching
you define smaller arteries

00:48:23.679 --> 00:48:27.119
which serve smaller regions of
tissue.

00:48:27.119 --> 00:48:31.725
These blood vessels provide
nutrients to the muscle in the

00:48:31.725 --> 00:48:35.491
muscular walls of the heart.
There are inflows and

00:48:35.491 --> 00:48:37.960
outflows, you know this is the
aorta up here;

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.809
this is the vena cava which is
bringing blood back down here.

00:48:42.809 --> 00:48:45.349
The heart has a right side and
a left side.

00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:48.131
If I divided it into the right
side and the left side I could

00:48:48.131 --> 00:48:50.969
put a dotted line here,
where the left ventricle and

00:48:50.969 --> 00:48:54.750
left atrium are on this side of
the line and the right ventricle

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:58.230
and the right atrium are on the
other side of the line.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:01.383
What we'll see when we talk
about this more next time,

00:49:01.383 --> 00:49:04.596
is that the left side of the
heart is more muscular and

00:49:04.596 --> 00:49:07.750
slightly larger than the right
side of the heart,

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.719
even though they're generating
the same flow rate.

00:49:10.719 --> 00:49:17.300
The left side of the heart is
larger.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:20.458
If we reduce this down to a
simpler picture,

00:49:20.458 --> 00:49:24.356
this is where I'm going to
start next time and take out the

00:49:24.356 --> 00:49:27.380
anatomy and replace it with this
cartoon,

00:49:27.380 --> 00:49:30.520
you can see that there's a
difference between the thickness

00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:33.264
of the muscular walls.
The muscular walls on the left

00:49:33.264 --> 00:49:36.202
side of the heart are slightly
thicker than the muscular walls

00:49:36.202 --> 00:49:38.903
on the right side of the heart.
You don't see them in this

00:49:38.903 --> 00:49:41.356
diagram, but if you looked at a
real heart you would see that

00:49:41.356 --> 00:49:43.463
that's true.
The right and left side of the

00:49:43.463 --> 00:49:45.603
heart are divided into two
chambers, atrium,

00:49:45.603 --> 00:49:47.768
ventricle,
atrium, ventricle:

00:49:47.768 --> 00:49:50.383
left ventricle,
right ventricle,

00:49:50.383 --> 00:49:52.829
right atrium,
left atrium.

00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:56.010
The inflows and the
outflows are guarded by valves

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:59.130
and there are four valves that
are important here.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:02.336
There's a valve which is shown
by this sort of floppy structure

00:50:02.336 --> 00:50:05.130
here between the left atrium and
the left ventricle.

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:08.761
There's another valve between
the left ventricle and the

00:50:08.761 --> 00:50:10.736
aorta.
Same thing on the other side,

00:50:10.736 --> 00:50:13.381
there's a valve between the
right atrium and the right

00:50:13.381 --> 00:50:15.683
ventricle,
and between the right ventricle

00:50:15.683 --> 00:50:19.282
and the pulmonary artery.
What we're going to talk about

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:23.780
next time is how these valves
function in order to convert the

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:28.057
work that's done by the heart in
generating pressure into a

00:50:28.057 --> 00:50:31.156
directional flow.
That's what we'll start with

00:50:31.156 --> 00:50:32.156
next time.

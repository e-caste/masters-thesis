00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.612
Professor Ben Polak: So
last time we finished up by

00:00:04.612 --> 00:00:06.930
playing the game of Nim and
you'll remember,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.135
I hope, that the game of Nim
was a game where there was two

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:15.412
piles of stones--we made do with
lines on the board--and the

00:00:15.412 --> 00:00:19.400
winner was the person who picked
up the last stone.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.528
Remember you had to pick piles.
I want to use the game of Nim

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:27.347
to make a transition here.
So what we had pointed out

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:31.112
about the game of Nim was it
illustrated very nicely for us

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:34.877
that games can have first mover
advantages or they can have

00:00:34.877 --> 00:00:38.314
second mover advantages.
A very small change in the

00:00:38.314 --> 00:00:42.140
game, essentially a very small
change in where we started from,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.565
could switch a game from a game
with a first mover advantage to

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:49.350
a game with a second mover
advantage.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.326
Now today, I want to just draw
a slightly grander lesson out of

00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:56.762
that game.
So not only was it the case

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:59.653
that the game sometimes has
first mover advantages and

00:00:59.653 --> 00:01:01.890
sometimes has second mover
advantages,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.562
but moreover,
we could tell when it had a

00:01:04.562 --> 00:01:08.503
first mover advantage and we
could tell when it had a second

00:01:08.503 --> 00:01:10.349
mover advantage.
Is that right?

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:13.446
When we actually looked at the
initial set up of those stones,

00:01:13.446 --> 00:01:16.441
we knew immediately that's a
game in which Player 1 is going

00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.171
to win,
or alternatively,

00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:22.237
we knew immediately that's a
game which Player 2 is going to

00:01:22.237 --> 00:01:24.733
win.
Now it turns out that that idea

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.241
is very general and actually has
a name attached to it,

00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:30.060
and that name is Zermelo.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.985
So today we'll start off by
talking about a theorem due to a

00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:42.057
guy called Zermelo,
and the idea of this theorem is

00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:44.003
this.
We're going to look at games

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:46.642
more general than just Nim,
and we're going to ask the

00:01:46.642 --> 00:01:49.078
question,
under what circumstances would

00:01:49.078 --> 00:01:51.652
you know about a game either
that Player 1,

00:01:51.652 --> 00:01:54.661
the person who goes first,
can force a win,

00:01:54.661 --> 00:01:58.815
or that Player 2 can force a
win, or will allow a third

00:01:58.815 --> 00:02:03.530
possibility,
which is it's going to be a tie.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.766
So here's the theorem,
suppose there are two players

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:09.431
in this game,
like the games that we looked

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:13.060
at last time,
and suppose--I won't define

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.633
this formally now--but suppose
the game is a game of perfect

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:21.245
information.
So what do I mean by perfect

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.676
information?
I'll define this later on in

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:27.631
the class, but for now all I
mean is, that whenever a player

00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:31.185
has his turn to move,
that player knows exactly what

00:02:31.185 --> 00:02:34.012
has happened prior in the game.
So, for example,

00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:36.927
all these sequential move games
we've been looking at are moves

00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:39.501
of perfect information.
When I get to move I know

00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:42.528
exactly what you did yesterday,
I know what I did the day

00:02:42.528 --> 00:02:45.459
before yesterday and so on.
So it's a game of perfect

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.557
information.
I'm going to assume that the

00:02:48.557 --> 00:02:51.580
game has a finite number of
nodes.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.395
So two things here,
it can't go on forever,

00:02:54.395 --> 00:02:58.550
this game, and also there's no
point in which it branches in an

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.490
infinite way.
So there's a finite number of

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.905
nodes, and we'll assume that the
game has three possible

00:03:04.905 --> 00:03:07.073
outcomes.
Actually there's a more general

00:03:07.073 --> 00:03:09.370
version of this theorem but this
will do for now.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.224
The three possible outcomes are
either a win for Player 1,

00:03:14.224 --> 00:03:19.534
so I'll call it W_1,
or a loss for Player 1,

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:25.039
which is obviously a win for
Player 2, or a tie.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.579
So the game--like Nim last
time, that only had two

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:30.543
outcomes.
So here we're going to look up

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:35.250
to three outcomes or three or
fewer outcomes I should say.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.930
So these are the conditions and
here's the result.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.822
So I said three,
it could be three but it could

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.840
also be two here,
I'm just allowing for three.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.652
(One is trivial.) So under
these conditions the following

00:03:51.652 --> 00:03:55.303
is true.
Either Player 1 can force a

00:03:55.303 --> 00:04:01.111
win, so either it's the case
that this game is a game that if

00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:04.789
Player 1 plays as well as they
can,

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:09.759
they're going to win the game
no matter what Player 2 does.

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:17.089
Or 1 can at least force a tie,
which means Player 1 can play

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:23.673
in such a way that they can
assure themselves of a tie

00:04:23.673 --> 00:04:28.269
regardless of what Player 2
does.

00:04:28.269 --> 00:04:41.222
Or it could be a game in which
2 can force a loss on 1,

00:04:41.222 --> 00:04:45.977
so a win for 2.
So this theorem,

00:04:45.977 --> 00:04:48.221
when you first look at it,
it doesn't seem to say very

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.848
much.
You're staring at this

00:04:49.848 --> 00:04:52.719
thing--you might think,
we already knew that we're

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.410
looking at games that only have
three possible outcomes win,

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.440
loss, or tie so it doesn't seem
so surprising if you look at

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.079
this theorem,
it says,

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:04.563
well, you're going to end up
with a win, or a loss,

00:05:04.563 --> 00:05:06.522
or a tie.
However, that's not quite what

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:08.356
the theorem says.
The theorem says,

00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:11.316
not only are you going to end
up there--we knew that

00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:13.870
already--but the games divide
themselves.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.200
Games of these forms divide
themselves into those games in

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.298
which Player 1 has a way of
winning regardless of what

00:05:20.298 --> 00:05:23.612
Player 2 does;
or games in which Player 1 has

00:05:23.612 --> 00:05:27.306
a way of forcing a tie
regardless of what Player 2

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:29.528
does;
or Player 2 has a way of

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:32.226
winning regardless of what
Player 1 does,

00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:34.790
so these games all have a
solution.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.990
Let's just go back to Nim to
illustrate the point.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.749
So in Nim actually there's no
tie so we can forget the middle

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:45.433
of these, and in Nim,
under certain circumstances it

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:48.649
is the case that Player 1 can
force a win.

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:52.137
Who remembers what the case
was, for when Player 1 can force

00:05:52.137 --> 00:05:54.450
a win?
Anybody?

00:05:54.450 --> 00:06:00.260
The people who played last time.
No, yes, Ale,

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.500
there's somebody here.
Shout it out.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.810
Student: Insuring that
the piles are equal for the

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.040
other player.
Professor Ben Polak: All

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.588
right, so if the piles start
unequal, then Player 1 can

00:06:14.588 --> 00:06:21.232
actually force a win.
So in Nim if the piles are

00:06:21.232 --> 00:06:29.410
unequal at the start,
then 1 can force a win.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.819
It really doesn't matter what 2
does, 2 is "toast."

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.982
Or the alternative case is the
piles are equal at the start,

00:06:37.982 --> 00:06:42.003
and if they're equal at the
start then it's Player 1 who's

00:06:42.003 --> 00:06:44.764
"toast."
Player 2 is going

00:06:44.764 --> 00:06:51.181
to--rather--force a loss on 1,
so 2 can force a loss on 1,

00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:55.050
i.e.
a win for Player 2.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.940
Does everyone remember that
from last time?

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.649
It's just before the weekend,
it shouldn't be so long ago.

00:07:02.649 --> 00:07:08.450
So this theorem applies to all
games of this form.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.862
So what games are of this form?
Let's try and think of some

00:07:10.862 --> 00:07:15.199
other examples.
So one example is tic-tac-toe.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.279
Everyone know the rules of
tic-tac-toe?

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.840
In England we call it Noughts
and Crosses, but you guys call

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.230
it tic-tac-toe,
is that right?

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:22.149
Everyone know what tic-tac-toe
is?

00:07:22.149 --> 00:07:26.389
Yeah, which category is
tic-tac-toe?

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:29.897
Is it a game which Player 1 can
force a win, or is it a category

00:07:29.897 --> 00:07:32.180
in which Player 1 can only force
a tie,

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.169
or is it a category which you'd
rather go second and Player 2

00:07:35.169 --> 00:07:37.860
can force a win for Player 2 or
a loss for Player 1?

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:41.759
Which is tic-tac-toe?
Let's have a show of hands here.

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.581
Who thinks tic-tac-toe is a
game in which Player 1 can force

00:07:45.581 --> 00:07:47.644
a win?
Who thinks tic-tac-toe is a

00:07:47.644 --> 00:07:50.220
game in which Player 1 can only
force a tie?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.690
Who thinks Player 2's going to
win?

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:56.376
Most of you are right.
It's a game in which if people

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:59.139
play correctly then it'll turn
out to be a tie.

00:07:59.139 --> 00:08:07.939
So tic-tac-toe is a game that
leads to a tie.

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:10.917
Player 1 can still make a
mistake, in which case they can

00:08:10.917 --> 00:08:13.294
lose.
Player 2 can make a mistake in

00:08:13.294 --> 00:08:17.036
which case they would lose,
but there is a way of playing

00:08:17.036 --> 00:08:19.662
that forces a tie.
So these are fairly simple

00:08:19.662 --> 00:08:21.920
games, let's talk about more
complicated games.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.839
So what about the game of
checkers?

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:26.470
So the game of checkers meets
these conditions.

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:29.686
It's a two player game.
You always know all the moves

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:31.555
prior to your move.
It's finite:

00:08:31.555 --> 00:08:34.641
there's some rules in checkers
that prevent it going on

00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:36.499
forever.
And there are two or three

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:39.242
outcomes: I guess there's a
third outcome if you get into a

00:08:39.242 --> 00:08:42.043
cycle you could tie.
So checkers fits all these

00:08:42.043 --> 00:08:45.340
descriptions and what this
theorem tells us is that

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.234
checkers has a solution.
I'm not sure I know what that

00:08:48.234 --> 00:08:50.578
solution is, or I think actually
somebody did compute it quite

00:08:50.578 --> 00:08:52.065
recently,
even in the last few months,

00:08:52.065 --> 00:08:54.190
I just forgot to Google it this
morning to remind myself.

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:57.808
But what this theorem tells us
even before those people that

00:08:57.808 --> 00:09:00.200
computed it: checkers has a
solution.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.270
Let's be a bit more ambitious.
What about chess?

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:07.792
So chess meets this description.
Chess is a two player game,

00:09:07.792 --> 00:09:11.129
everybody knows all the moves
before them, it's sequential,

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:15.103
it has finite number of moves,
it's a very large number but it

00:09:15.103 --> 00:09:18.230
is finite, and it has three
possible outcomes,

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.821
a win, a loss, or a tie.
So let's be careful,

00:09:21.821 --> 00:09:25.275
the reason it's finite is that
if you cycle--I forget what it

00:09:25.275 --> 00:09:28.038
is--three times then the game is
declared a draw,

00:09:28.038 --> 00:09:30.478
declared a tie.
So what's this theorem telling

00:09:30.478 --> 00:09:35.524
us?
It's telling us that there is a

00:09:35.524 --> 00:09:41.700
way to solve chess.
Chess has a solution.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.100
We don't know what that
solution is.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.853
It could be that solution is
that Player 1,

00:09:45.853 --> 00:09:49.590
who's the player with the white
pieces can force a win.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.080
It could be that Player 1 can
only force a tie,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.950
and it could even be that
Player 2 can force a win.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:59.000
We don't know which it is,
but there is a solution.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.409
There's a catch to this theorem.
What's the catch?

00:10:02.409 --> 00:10:05.259
The catch is it doesn't
actually tell us--this theorem

00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:07.840
is not going to tell us what
that solution is.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.111
It doesn't tell us how to play.
This theorem,

00:10:10.111 --> 00:10:12.484
in and of itself,
doesn't tell us how to play

00:10:12.484 --> 00:10:16.061
chess.
It just says there is a

00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:19.276
way to play chess.
So we're going to try and prove

00:10:19.276 --> 00:10:21.288
this.
We don't often do proofs in

00:10:21.288 --> 00:10:25.153
class, but the reason I want to
prove this particular one is

00:10:25.153 --> 00:10:28.952
because I think the proof is
instructive as part of sort of

00:10:28.952 --> 00:10:31.699
QR at Yale.
So here's another example here,

00:10:31.699 --> 00:10:34.770
and some other examples.
You could think of chess as

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:36.850
being the most dramatic example.

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:56.203
So the reason I want to spend
actually some time proving this

00:10:56.203 --> 00:11:03.388
today is because we're going to
prove it by induction and I'm

00:11:03.388 --> 00:11:08.213
going to sketch the proof.
I'm not going to go through

00:11:08.213 --> 00:11:10.909
every possible step but I want
to give people here a feeling

00:11:10.909 --> 00:11:12.919
for what a proof by induction
looks like.

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:14.710
The reason for this is,
my guess is,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.115
well let's find out,
how many of you have seen a

00:11:17.115 --> 00:11:20.610
proof by induction before?
How many have not?

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.633
So for those of you who haven't
I think it's a good thing in

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:24.759
life, at one point in your life
to see a proof by induction,

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:27.557
and for those who have,
my guess is you saw it in some

00:11:27.557 --> 00:11:30.883
awful math class in high school
and it just went over--it didn't

00:11:30.883 --> 00:11:32.889
necessarily go over your head
but,

00:11:32.889 --> 00:11:36.070
the excitement of it doesn't
catch on.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.140
This is a context where it
might appeal.

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:46.400
So proof by induction.
We're going to prove this by

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:57.384
induction on the maximum length
of the game and we'll call that

00:11:57.384 --> 00:11:59.291
N.
We'll call N the maximum length

00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:00.830
of the game.
What do I mean by this?

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:06.001
If I write down a tree I can
always look at all the paths

00:12:06.001 --> 00:12:11.542
from the beginning of the tree
all the way through to the end

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:14.719
of the tree.
And I'm going to look at the

00:12:14.719 --> 00:12:18.240
path in that particular tree
that has the largest length,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.742
and I'll call that the length
of the game, the maximum length

00:12:21.742 --> 00:12:24.586
of the game.
So we're going to do induction

00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:26.950
on the maximum length of the
game.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:28.710
So how do we start a proof by
induction?

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:30.965
Let's just remind ourselves,
those people who have seen them

00:12:30.965 --> 00:12:33.572
before.
We're going to prove that this

00:12:33.572 --> 00:12:36.965
theorem this true,
the claim in the theorem is

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:41.490
true for the easy case when the
game is only 1 move long.

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.524
That's the first step,
and then we're going to try and

00:12:45.524 --> 00:12:49.330
show that if it's true for all
games of length &lt;

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:51.264
= N,
whatever N is,

00:12:51.264 --> 00:12:56.559
then it must therefore be true
for games of length N+1.

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:58.850
That's the way you do a proof
by induction.

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:01.750
So let's just see how that
works in practice.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.811
So let's start with the easy
step and we'll do it in some

00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:08.200
detail, more detail than you
really need to in a math class.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.250
So if N = 1,
what do these games look like?

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.210
Well let's look at some
examples here.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:18.259
So I claim it's pretty trivial
if N = 1 but let's do it anyway.

00:13:18.259 --> 00:13:20.600
So the game might look like
this.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.912
Player 1 is going to
move--here's Player 1

00:13:22.912 --> 00:13:26.128
moving--the game's only length
one--so Player 1's the only

00:13:26.128 --> 00:13:30.059
player who ever gets to move.
So the game might look like

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.999
this.
Let's put in a fifth branch,

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:34.606
it might look like this.
And at the end of this game,

00:13:34.606 --> 00:13:37.269
rather than putting payoffs let
me just put the outcomes.

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:40.215
So the outcome must either be a
win, or a tie,

00:13:40.215 --> 00:13:43.029
or a loss, so suppose it looks
like this.

00:13:43.029 --> 00:13:47.697
Suppose it's a win,
or here we could have a tie,

00:13:47.697 --> 00:13:53.357
or here we could have a win
again, or here we could have a

00:13:53.357 --> 00:13:57.230
loss, and here we could have a
tie.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:02.090
So in this particular game I
claim it's pretty clear this

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:06.869
game has a solution.
It's pretty clear what 1 should

00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:08.129
do.
What should 1 do?

00:14:08.129 --> 00:14:12.360
1 should pick one of her
choices that leads to a win.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.582
To be careful I'll put 1 in
here just to distinguish who it

00:14:15.582 --> 00:14:17.750
is who's actually winning and
losing.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:21.149
So in this game I claim that
this game has a pretty obvious

00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:24.665
solution, either Player 1 is
going to choose this branch that

00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:27.830
leads to a win or this branch
that leads to a win,

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:31.680
and either way Player 1 is
going to win.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.086
Is that obvious?
It's so obvious,

00:14:33.086 --> 00:14:35.548
it's kind of painful.
So I claim this game,

00:14:35.548 --> 00:14:39.960
we could actually replace this
first node with what's going to

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:43.070
happen which is Player 1's going
to win.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.559
Is that right?
That was easy.

00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:49.740
Let's look at a different
example, we'll do three.

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:53.588
So here's another possible
example, and this again,

00:14:53.588 --> 00:14:57.899
Player 1 is going to move here
and this time the possible

00:14:57.899 --> 00:15:01.210
outcomes are tie,
or a loss, or a loss.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.272
Once again it's a one player
game, this time he has three

00:15:05.272 --> 00:15:09.480
choices and the three choices
lead to a tie or he loses,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.110
so I claim once again this is
simple.

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.914
What Player 1 should do is what?
Choose the tie since there's no

00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:15.612
way of winning.
But in that case he could

00:15:15.612 --> 00:15:17.548
actually force it.
He could actually choose the

00:15:17.548 --> 00:15:19.330
tie in which case he's going to
tie.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:21.820
So this game has a solution
called choose the tie.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.717
And again, we could replace the
first node of the game with

00:15:25.717 --> 00:15:29.010
what's actually going to happen
which is a tie.

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:32.523
Everyone happy?
There's one other possibility I

00:15:32.523 --> 00:15:35.086
guess.
The other possibility is that

00:15:35.086 --> 00:15:39.155
here Player 1 has a lot of
choices, maybe four choices in

00:15:39.155 --> 00:15:43.481
this case,
once again Player 1 is going to

00:15:43.481 --> 00:15:48.499
move but in each
case--unfortunately for Player

00:15:48.499 --> 00:15:54.389
1--in each case the outcome is
that Player 1 loses.

00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:56.798
So this is a game in which
Player 1 is going to lose no

00:15:56.798 --> 00:15:59.015
matter what they do.
Once again it has a solution:

00:15:59.015 --> 00:16:01.400
the solution is Player 1 is
toast and is going to lose.

00:16:08.129 --> 00:16:10.915
So I claim this has really
captured all the possibilities

00:16:10.915 --> 00:16:13.431
of games of length 1.
I mean you could imagine that

00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:16.268
there could be more branches on
them, but basically there are

00:16:16.268 --> 00:16:19.312
these three possibilities.
Either it's the case that one

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:22.716
of those branches leads to a
win, in which case the solution

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:25.485
is Player 1 wins;
or it's the case that none of

00:16:25.485 --> 00:16:28.659
the branches have wins in them,
but one of them has a tie,

00:16:28.659 --> 00:16:30.720
in which Player 1 is going to
tie;

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.629
or it's the case that all the
branches have loss in them,

00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:35.500
in which Player 1's going to
lose.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.350
So I claim I'm for done for
games of length one.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:42.053
Everyone okay?
So that step is deceptively

00:16:42.053 --> 00:16:45.824
easy but there it is.
All right, now we do the

00:16:45.824 --> 00:16:47.529
inductive step,
the big step.

00:16:47.529 --> 00:16:50.494
What we're going to do is we're
going to assume that the

00:16:50.494 --> 00:16:53.452
statement of the theorem,
which I've now hidden

00:16:53.452 --> 00:16:57.817
unfortunately--let me unhide it
if I can, it's not going to be

00:16:57.817 --> 00:16:58.390
easy.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.692
This now visible?
So now let's assume that the

00:17:10.692 --> 00:17:17.638
statement of this theorem is
true for all games length &lt;

00:17:17.638 --> 00:17:29.058
= N, suppose that's the case.
Suppose the claim is true for

00:17:29.058 --> 00:17:41.619
all games of this type,
of length &lt;= some N.

00:17:41.619 --> 00:17:45.916
What we need to show is--what
we're going to try and show is

00:17:45.916 --> 00:17:50.140
therefore it will be true for
all games of length N + 1.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:58.984
What we want to show is--we
claim, therefore,

00:17:58.984 --> 00:18:07.225
it will be true for games of
length N + 1,

00:18:07.225 --> 00:18:16.069
that's the key step in
inductive proofs.

00:18:16.069 --> 00:18:19.589
All right, so how are we going
to do that?

00:18:19.589 --> 00:18:22.038
Well let's have a look at a
game of length N + 1,

00:18:22.038 --> 00:18:24.895
and obviously I can't use
thousands here so let me choose

00:18:24.895 --> 00:18:28.830
from relatively small numbers,
but the idea will go through.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:34.778
So let's have a look at a game.
So here's a game in which

00:18:34.778 --> 00:18:40.049
Player 1 moves first,
Player 2 moves second.

00:18:40.049 --> 00:18:44.522
Let's suppose that if Player 2
does this, then 1 only has

00:18:44.522 --> 00:18:48.814
little choice here,
up here then one has a more

00:18:48.814 --> 00:18:53.849
complicated choice,
and perhaps 2 could move again.

00:18:53.849 --> 00:18:55.872
So this is quite a complicated
little game up here,

00:18:55.872 --> 00:18:58.299
and down here let's make it a
little bit less complicated.

00:18:58.299 --> 00:19:02.504
Here the game looks like this
and then comes to an end,

00:19:02.504 --> 00:19:06.061
so the tree looks like this.
I haven't put the end,

00:19:06.061 --> 00:19:09.559
I haven't put the outcomes on
it but the tree looks like this.

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:12.279
So how long is this tree first
of all?

00:19:12.279 --> 00:19:16.380
Well I claim that the longest
path in this tree,

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:20.480
from the beginning to the end
has four steps.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.410
Let's just check.
So one, two,

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:27.650
three, four that's what I claim
is the longest path.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:33.107
Any path going down this way
only has three moves in it,

00:19:33.107 --> 00:19:36.579
so this is a game of length
four.

00:19:36.579 --> 00:19:42.061
So we can apply it to our
claim, let's assume that the

00:19:42.061 --> 00:19:47.440
theorem holds for all trees
length three or fewer,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.589
so that N + 1 is 4 for the
purpose of our example.

00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:57.937
So in this example--I don't
want to put it here,

00:19:57.937 --> 00:20:03.338
let's put it here--in this
example N = 3,

00:20:03.338 --> 00:20:09.704
so that N + 1 = 4.
Everyone happy with this in the

00:20:09.704 --> 00:20:12.948
example?
Now what I want to observe

00:20:12.948 --> 00:20:17.466
about this is the following:
contained in this N + 1,

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:21.809
or the game of length 4 are
some smaller games.

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:23.599
You could think of them as
sub-games.

00:20:23.599 --> 00:20:26.830
They're games within the game,
is that right?

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:31.809
So let's have a look.
I claim, in particular--draw

00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:40.022
around them in pink--there's a
game here that follows Player 1

00:20:40.022 --> 00:20:47.561
choosing Up and there's a game
here that follows Player 1

00:20:47.561 --> 00:20:53.410
choosing Down,
is that right?

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:58.640
Okay, so these are both games,
and what do we have here?

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.134
So this little game in
here--the game in the top

00:21:02.134 --> 00:21:06.373
circle, the game that follows
Player 1 moving up--that's a

00:21:06.373 --> 00:21:10.574
game and it has a length.
So this little thing is a game

00:21:10.574 --> 00:21:14.527
and I'm going to call it a
sub-game, some jargon that we'll

00:21:14.527 --> 00:21:17.730
be getting used to later on in
the semester.

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:25.340
It's a game within the game,
but it's basically just a game:

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:32.823
it's a sub-game and this is a
sub-game following 1 choosing

00:21:32.823 --> 00:21:38.369
Up--let's put Up in
here--following up.

00:21:38.369 --> 00:21:41.814
And I claim that this game has
a length--this sub-game has a

00:21:41.814 --> 00:21:44.015
length.
So we knew that we started from

00:21:44.015 --> 00:21:46.610
a game of length 4,
we've taken one of the moves,

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:50.069
and let's just make sure this
is actually a game of length 3.

00:21:50.069 --> 00:21:53.304
So the game started here,
this would be a game of length

00:21:53.304 --> 00:21:55.891
3 because you could go one,
two, three moves,

00:21:55.891 --> 00:21:59.009
is that right?
So this is a game of length 3.

00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:08.081
So this is a sub-game following
1 choosing Up and it,

00:22:08.081 --> 00:22:13.140
the sub-game,
has length 3.

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:21.004
Down here, this is also a
sub-game, it's a game that

00:22:21.004 --> 00:22:29.948
follows Player 1 choosing Down
and this little sub-game has

00:22:29.948 --> 00:22:39.355
length--now here we have to be a
little bit careful--you might

00:22:39.355 --> 00:22:48.299
think that since we started from
a game of length 4,

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:53.210
after the first move we must be
in a game of length 3.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:56.021
But actually that's not true,
and if we look carefully,

00:22:56.021 --> 00:22:58.885
we'll notice that this game
down here, the game starting

00:22:58.885 --> 00:23:02.410
here actually isn't of length 3.
It's of length 2.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.451
Is that right?
So even though started from a

00:23:04.451 --> 00:23:06.716
game of length 4,
by going this way we put

00:23:06.716 --> 00:23:08.760
ourselves into a game of length
2.

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:16.023
Is that right?
So 1,2 or 1,2--whatever--it has

00:23:16.023 --> 00:23:20.708
length 2.
Okay, all right so in this

00:23:20.708 --> 00:23:25.868
example N is 3 and N + 1 is 4,
and our assumption,

00:23:25.868 --> 00:23:29.660
our induction assumption is
what?

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:38.357
We've assumed that the claim of
the theorem holds for all games

00:23:38.357 --> 00:23:44.530
&lt;= N, which in this case
means &lt;= 3.

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.396
So what does that tell us?
That tells us,

00:23:47.396 --> 00:23:51.593
by our assumption,
this game, which I've put a

00:23:51.593 --> 00:23:56.911
pink circle around on the top,
this is a game of length 3,

00:23:56.911 --> 00:24:02.315
this game has a solution.
It must have a solution because

00:24:02.315 --> 00:24:07.773
it's of length 3 or less.
So by the induction hypothesis

00:24:07.773 --> 00:24:14.649
as it's called--by the induction
hypothesis--this is a technical

00:24:14.649 --> 00:24:19.560
term, but what's the induction
hypothesis?

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:29.687
It's this thing.
By the assumption that we made

00:24:29.687 --> 00:24:38.248
this game has a solution.
So it's a game of length 3,3

00:24:38.248 --> 00:24:40.819
&lt;= N in this case.
So this game must have a

00:24:40.819 --> 00:24:44.542
solution.
Now I don't immediately know by

00:24:44.542 --> 00:24:50.031
staring at it what it is,
but let's suppose it was W,

00:24:50.031 --> 00:24:53.589
say it was W.
And the game down below,

00:24:53.589 --> 00:24:57.562
this is also a game,
and it's a game of length 2 but

00:24:57.562 --> 00:25:00.599
2 is less than 3 as well,
2 &lt;= 3.

00:25:00.599 --> 00:25:06.289
So this game also has a
solution.

00:25:06.289 --> 00:25:13.717
This game also,
by the same assumption,

00:25:13.717 --> 00:25:22.709
has a solution,
so its solution is say--I don't

00:25:22.709 --> 00:25:29.009
know--maybe its L.
So what does that mean to say

00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:33.076
that these games have solutions,
in this case we're going to

00:25:33.076 --> 00:25:35.764
assume W is this one,
and L is this one,

00:25:35.764 --> 00:25:38.230
what does it mean?
It means that,

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:41.690
just as we did with the games
up there, we could put the

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.269
solution at the beginning of the
game.

00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:47.776
We know that if we get into
this game, we're going to get

00:25:47.776 --> 00:25:51.236
the solution of this game;
and we know if we get into this

00:25:51.236 --> 00:25:54.099
game, we're going to get the
solution of this game.

00:25:54.099 --> 00:25:58.837
So we can replace this one with
its solution which by assumption

00:25:58.837 --> 00:26:03.198
was W, and this one by its
solution which by assumption was

00:26:03.198 --> 00:26:04.977
L.
And here I want to be really

00:26:04.977 --> 00:26:08.011
careful, I need to keep track of
which person it is it's a win or

00:26:08.011 --> 00:26:10.820
loss for.
So this was a win for Player 1,

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:14.867
hence it was a loss for Player
2, and this was a loss for

00:26:14.867 --> 00:26:18.119
Player 1, hence it was a win for
Player 2.

00:26:18.119 --> 00:26:22.063
So these games,
each of them have some

00:26:22.063 --> 00:26:28.350
solution, and this case I've
written down the solutions as W

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.150
or L.
So now what could we do?

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.349
Let me just bring down this
board again.

00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:37.329
I can translate this game into
a very simple game.

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:40.929
I'm going to translate it up
here, so this game can be

00:26:40.929 --> 00:26:47.126
translated as follows.
Player 1 moves,

00:26:47.126 --> 00:27:06.609
if he goes Up then he hits a W
and if he goes Down he hits a L.

00:27:06.609 --> 00:27:09.958
So in this particular example,
Player 1 is effectively

00:27:09.958 --> 00:27:13.749
choosing between going Up and
finding himself in a game which

00:27:13.749 --> 00:27:16.797
has a solution,
and the solution is he wins it,

00:27:16.797 --> 00:27:20.014
or going Down and finding
himself in a game which has a

00:27:20.014 --> 00:27:24.640
solution,
and the solution is he's toast.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.329
But that's what?
That's a one move game.

00:27:29.329 --> 00:27:31.936
So we know this has a solution,
and in particular,

00:27:31.936 --> 00:27:37.259
he's going to choose Up.
This one has a solution.

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:55.820
This has a solution,
it is a game of length 1.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.779
So what do we do?
Somewhat schematically,

00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:04.289
we took a game of length N + 1,
in this case that was 4;

00:28:04.289 --> 00:28:09.406
and we pointed out that once
Player 1 has made her first move

00:28:09.406 --> 00:28:12.220
in this game,
we are in a game,

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.458
or in a sub-game if you like,
that has length less than 4,

00:28:15.458 --> 00:28:17.220
it could be 3,
it could be 2,

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:21.894
whatever.
Whatever sub-game we're in,

00:28:21.894 --> 00:28:26.259
by assumption,
that game has a solution.

00:28:26.259 --> 00:28:29.542
So it's really effectively,
Player 1 is choosing between

00:28:29.542 --> 00:28:33.004
going into a game with solution
W or going into a game with

00:28:33.004 --> 00:28:35.351
solution L.
And if there were 15 other

00:28:35.351 --> 00:28:37.918
sub-games here,
each one would have a solution,

00:28:37.918 --> 00:28:41.322
and each one Player 1 would be
able to associate that solution

00:28:41.322 --> 00:28:44.559
with what he's going to
get--what she's going to get.

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:49.647
So I claim that,
if it in fact is true that each

00:28:49.647 --> 00:28:55.710
of these sub-games of length 3
or less had a solution,

00:28:55.710 --> 00:28:59.293
then the game of length 4 must
have a solution,

00:28:59.293 --> 00:29:03.518
which is what?
It's the solution which is:

00:29:03.518 --> 00:29:07.930
Player 1 should pick the best
sub-game.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:11.299
Are people convinced by that
step?

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:15.447
People are looking slightly
"deer in the headlamps" now,

00:29:15.447 --> 00:29:20.304
so let me just say it again.
We started by assuming that all

00:29:20.304 --> 00:29:23.569
games of length 3 or less,
or N or less,

00:29:23.569 --> 00:29:27.615
have a solution.
We pointed out that any game

00:29:27.615 --> 00:29:32.877
that has length N + 1 can be
thought of as an initial move by

00:29:32.877 --> 00:29:37.350
Player 1 followed by a game of
length N or less,

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:41.287
N or fewer I should say.
Each of those games of N or

00:29:41.287 --> 00:29:45.418
fewer steps has a solution,
so Player 1 is just going to

00:29:45.418 --> 00:29:49.849
choose the game that has the
best solution for her and we're

00:29:49.849 --> 00:29:54.300
done.
In this particular example,

00:29:54.300 --> 00:30:02.388
Player 1 is going to choose Up
and therefore the solution to

00:30:02.388 --> 00:30:07.460
this parent game is Player 1
wins.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:11.576
Now the hard step I think in
proofs by induction is realizing

00:30:11.576 --> 00:30:15.473
that you're done.
So I claim we're now done,

00:30:15.473 --> 00:30:19.483
why are we done?
Well we know that it was pretty

00:30:19.483 --> 00:30:23.140
easy that all games of length 1
have a solution.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.103
That was pretty trivial.
And we've shown that if any

00:30:27.103 --> 00:30:32.617
game of length of N or fewer has
a solution, then games of N + 1

00:30:32.617 --> 00:30:35.420
have a solution.
So now let's see how we can

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.049
proceed.
We know that games of length 1

00:30:38.049 --> 00:30:41.200
have a solution,
so let's consider games of

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.215
length 2.
Games of length 2,

00:30:43.215 --> 00:30:45.570
do games of length 2 have a
solution?

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:50.102
Well let's set N = 1.
We know that if games of length

00:30:50.102 --> 00:30:52.872
1 have a solution,
then any game of length 2 could

00:30:52.872 --> 00:30:56.660
be thought of as an initial step
followed by a game of length 1,

00:30:56.660 --> 00:30:59.367
but that has a solution,
so therefore games of length 2

00:30:59.367 --> 00:31:01.593
have a solution.
Now let's think of games with

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:04.377
length 3, we've shown that games
with length 1 have a solution

00:31:04.377 --> 00:31:06.339
and games with length 2 have a
solution.

00:31:06.339 --> 00:31:09.475
Any game of length 3 can be
thought of as a game in which

00:31:09.475 --> 00:31:13.002
there's an initial step followed
by either a game of length 1 or

00:31:13.002 --> 00:31:16.359
a game of length 2,
each of which have a solution,

00:31:16.359 --> 00:31:20.430
so once again a game of length
3 has a solution and so on.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.699
So games of induction,
they work by building up on the

00:31:23.699 --> 00:31:26.536
length of the game,
and we're ending up knowing

00:31:26.536 --> 00:31:29.919
that we're done.
For those people who have never

00:31:29.919 --> 00:31:34.217
seen a proof by induction don't
worry I'm not going to test you

00:31:34.217 --> 00:31:37.059
on a proof with induction on the
exam,

00:31:37.059 --> 00:31:39.069
I just wanted you to see one
once.

00:31:39.069 --> 00:31:43.170
Let's all take a deep breath
and try and digest this a little

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:48.661
bit by playing a game.
I'll leave it up there so you

00:31:48.661 --> 00:31:51.440
can stare at it.
We'll want it down again later.

00:31:57.549 --> 00:32:04.045
Let's try and actually play a
game and see if we can actually

00:32:04.045 --> 00:32:07.987
throw any light on this.
So I'm going to pick out

00:32:07.987 --> 00:32:10.288
volunteers like I did last time,
but first of all,

00:32:10.288 --> 00:32:11.980
let me tell you what the game
is.

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.731
So once again I'm going to have
rocks in this game,

00:32:14.731 --> 00:32:17.758
and once again I'm going to
approximate those rocks with

00:32:17.758 --> 00:32:23.360
marks on the blackboard.
So here's an example.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:29.160
The example is this.
The game involves an array of

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:37.500
rocks, so here the array has
five rows and three columns.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.161
So the rocks are not arranged
as they were before in piles,

00:32:41.161 --> 00:32:43.940
but rather in a sort of in a
pretty array.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:45.970
I should have made it more even
but this is: one,

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:47.240
two, three, four,
five rows;

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.015
and one, two,
three columns,

00:32:49.015 --> 00:32:59.192
at least in this example.
But in general there's an array

00:32:59.192 --> 00:33:04.711
of rocks, N x M.
We're going to play

00:33:04.711 --> 00:33:10.274
sequentially with the players.
And the way the game is going

00:33:10.274 --> 00:33:17.160
to work is this--is when it's
your turn to move,

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.759
you have to point to one of
these rocks and whichever rock

00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:26.169
you point to I will remove.
I will delete that rock and all

00:33:26.169 --> 00:33:29.239
the rocks that lie above or to
the right of it:

00:33:29.239 --> 00:33:32.509
all the rocks that lie to the
northeast of it.

00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:36.802
So for example,
if you pointed to this rock,

00:33:36.802 --> 00:33:41.394
then I will remove this rock
and also this one,

00:33:41.394 --> 00:33:46.336
this one, and this one.
If the next person comes along

00:33:46.336 --> 00:33:50.007
and chooses this one,
then I will remove this one,

00:33:50.007 --> 00:33:53.190
and also that one.
Okay, everyone understand?

00:33:53.190 --> 00:34:00.301
All right and the game is
lost--this is important--the

00:34:00.301 --> 00:34:08.619
game is lost by the person who
ends up taking the last rock.

00:34:08.619 --> 00:34:18.790
The loser is the person who
ends up removing the last rock.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:24.789
Could I have some volunteers?
Can I volunteer people then?

00:34:24.789 --> 00:34:27.997
How about the guy with the
white t-shirt with the yellow on

00:34:27.997 --> 00:34:31.460
there?
Okay, come on up front,

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:36.969
and who else can I volunteer.
Everyone's looking away from

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:39.099
me, desperately looking away
from me.

00:34:39.099 --> 00:34:42.858
How about the guy with the Yale
sweatshirt on,

00:34:42.858 --> 00:34:46.200
the Yale football sweatshirt
on, okay.

00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.900
So come on up.
Your name is?

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:53.285
I should get a mike,
let me get a mike up here,

00:34:53.285 --> 00:34:55.850
thank you.
Great, your name is?

00:34:55.850 --> 00:34:57.242
Student: Noah.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:34:57.242 --> 00:34:58.809
Noah and your name is?
Student: Koran.

00:34:58.809 --> 00:34:59.570
Professor Ben Polak:Say
it into the mike.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:00.970
Student: Koran.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:02.795
Koran okay.
So Noah and Koran are our

00:35:02.795 --> 00:35:05.110
players.
Everyone understand the rules?

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.719
Do you understand the rules?
Yeah?

00:35:06.719 --> 00:35:08.590
So why don't we make Noah go
first.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.670
So Noah which rock are you
going to remove?

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.610
Remember the last rock loses.
Student: That one.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:15.130
Professor Ben Polak:
That one.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:19.646
Okay, so Noah chose this one.
So I'm going to remove this one

00:35:19.646 --> 00:35:22.286
and the one above it.
Student: So all the

00:35:22.286 --> 00:35:23.349
rocks to the north and east are
deleted, right?

00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:27.107
Professor Ben Polak: All
the rocks to the north and east

00:35:27.107 --> 00:35:32.580
of it are deleted.
That means you--last rock loses.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:47.550
Okay good.
Student: That one.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:49.170
Professor Ben Polak:
That one okay.

00:35:49.170 --> 00:36:00.519
So now we have an L shape.
Student: That one.

00:36:00.519 --> 00:36:05.220
Professor Ben Polak:
That one, all right.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.720
Student: That one.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:07.460
That one okay,
okay.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.676
All right so we're done.
Okay, everyone understand how

00:36:10.676 --> 00:36:14.371
that worked?
Round of applause for our

00:36:14.371 --> 00:36:17.710
players please,
thank you.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.559
Let me get two more volunteers
now that everyone has seen it.

00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:23.200
These guys had the hard job,
they had to figure it out cold.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.516
Two more volunteers?
Oh I don't have to pick

00:36:26.516 --> 00:36:28.390
volunteers--this is Yale,
somebody volunteer.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:29.770
Are you volunteering?
Great.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:35.965
I have one volunteer.
You can pick an opponent if you

00:36:35.965 --> 00:36:38.769
like.
There you go thank you.

00:36:38.769 --> 00:36:43.458
Your name is,
let's just wait until the mikes

00:36:43.458 --> 00:36:45.570
are here.
So your name is?

00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.076
Student: Peter.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:36:47.076 --> 00:36:50.840
Peter and your name is Justin.
Student: Justin.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:56.900
Professor Ben Polak: Let
me put a new array up here.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.388
So let's put a new array up
here and this time let's make

00:36:59.388 --> 00:37:01.620
it--it doesn't have to be odd.
So let's make it this time a

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:08.076
little bit more complicated.
So we'll have five--let's have

00:37:08.076 --> 00:37:15.190
four rows and five columns this
time.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:21.405
Okay so last time I had five
rows and three columns,

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:27.500
and this time I have four rows
and five columns.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.340
Away you go,
let me move out of the way.

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:32.059
Why don't you stand a bit
nearer to the board--make it a

00:37:32.059 --> 00:37:33.528
little easier for people to see
what's going on,

00:37:33.528 --> 00:37:36.300
there you go.
So Peter you want to go first?

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.178
Student: Sure, that one.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:37:39.178 --> 00:37:41.807
That one okay.
So this one goes,

00:37:41.807 --> 00:37:46.940
which means all of these go as
well.

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.320
Anyone got any advice from the
floor?

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.520
Shout things out, not too loud.

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:55.110
Student: I'll try going
here.

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:55.550
Professor Ben Polak:
There.

00:37:55.550 --> 00:38:10.440
Okay we're back to our L shape
again here.

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:15.260
Now people can see what's going
on all right.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.579
Student: I'll go here
and speed it up.

00:38:16.579 --> 00:38:18.590
Professor Ben Polak: All
right thank you.

00:38:18.590 --> 00:38:26.000
So a round of applause again.
Thank you guys.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.639
So here's what I claim about
this game.

00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:30.615
First, and this isn't a formal
claim, this is a lot harder than

00:38:30.615 --> 00:38:32.440
the game we played last time,
right?

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.449
Everyone is convinced by that
all right.

00:38:34.449 --> 00:38:37.782
So here's going to be an
exercise, or something that's a

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:40.172
challenge.
I may even put it formally on

00:38:40.172 --> 00:38:43.439
the problem set this week,
but let me just say if I do put

00:38:43.439 --> 00:38:45.559
this on the problem set this
week,

00:38:45.559 --> 00:38:47.570
I don't expect you all to solve
it.

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.748
So if I do put it on the
problem set, it's an optional

00:38:49.748 --> 00:38:53.513
problem.
But here's the challenge,

00:38:53.513 --> 00:38:59.683
the challenge is,
I know from Zermelo's theorem

00:38:59.683 --> 00:39:06.255
that no matter what N is,
and no matter what M is,

00:39:06.255 --> 00:39:16.227
this game has a solution.
So Zermelo's theorem tells us

00:39:16.227 --> 00:39:22.806
this game has a solution.
Now, notice it could have a

00:39:22.806 --> 00:39:24.976
different solution depending on
the N and the M,

00:39:24.976 --> 00:39:27.146
depending on how many rows and
how many columns,

00:39:27.146 --> 00:39:31.417
is that right?.
So depending on N and M,

00:39:31.417 --> 00:39:38.392
each such game has a
solution--is that right--which

00:39:38.392 --> 00:39:45.646
could depend on N and on M,
on the number of rows and

00:39:45.646 --> 00:39:48.914
columns.
So just as in Nim,

00:39:48.914 --> 00:39:52.469
it depended on how those piles
started out.

00:39:52.469 --> 00:39:55.440
So what's going to be the
homework assignment?

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:13.750
Find the solution.
Homework- what is the solution?

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:19.611
So I claim, let me give you a
hint, I claim it is useful to

00:40:19.611 --> 00:40:23.250
remember that there is a
solution.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.560
It turns out to be useful to
remember that.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.446
That wasn't much of a hint.
You knew that already,

00:40:26.446 --> 00:40:30.890
but let me just emphasize that.
Okay, so I want to do a bit of

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:35.887
a transition now away from these
games like chess and like

00:40:35.887 --> 00:40:38.447
checkers,
and like this game with the

00:40:38.447 --> 00:40:40.791
rocks or Nim,
and I want to be a little bit

00:40:40.791 --> 00:40:43.334
formal for a while.
So one thing that we haven't

00:40:43.334 --> 00:40:45.445
done for a while,
actually since the mid-term,

00:40:45.445 --> 00:40:47.370
is write down some formal
definitions.

00:40:47.370 --> 00:40:52.647
So I'm going to do that now.
I want at least one of these

00:40:52.647 --> 00:40:52.980
boards back.

00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:19.712
So as I warned very early in
the class, there are some points

00:41:19.712 --> 00:41:23.055
of the day when we have to stop
and do some work and the next

00:41:23.055 --> 00:41:25.340
twenty minutes or so is such a
point.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:48.510
So what is this?
This is formal stuff.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.670
The first thing I want to do is
I want to give you a formal

00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:54.667
definition of something I've
already mentioned today and

00:41:54.667 --> 00:41:57.010
that's the idea of perfect
information.

00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:00.321
What we've been looking at,
or at least since the mid-term,

00:42:00.321 --> 00:42:02.320
are games of perfect
information.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:20.102
So a game of perfect
information is one in which at

00:42:20.102 --> 00:42:41.442
every node, or at each node in
the game the player whose turn

00:42:41.442 --> 00:43:02.070
it is to move at that node knows
which node she is at.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:04.704
So it's a very simple idea.
Every game we've seen since the

00:43:04.704 --> 00:43:08.050
mid-term has this property.
When you're playing this game

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:13.616
you know where you are.
So you know which node you're

00:43:13.616 --> 00:43:21.159
at, you know what your choices
are and what that means

00:43:21.159 --> 00:43:27.320
implicitly is she must know how
she got there.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.219
So the whole history of the
game is observed by everybody.

00:43:30.219 --> 00:43:32.831
When I get to move I know what
you did yesterday,

00:43:32.831 --> 00:43:35.280
I know what I did the day
before yesterday,

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:38.472
and if I'm playing with a third
person I know what they did the

00:43:38.472 --> 00:43:41.816
day before that.
So a very simple idea but it

00:43:41.816 --> 00:43:46.994
turns out to be an idea that
actually allows us to use things

00:43:46.994 --> 00:43:50.360
like backward induction very
simply.

00:43:50.360 --> 00:43:54.024
Now so far all we've been doing
is thinking about such games,

00:43:54.024 --> 00:43:57.397
games like perfect competition,
sorry games like quantity

00:43:57.397 --> 00:44:00.493
competition between firms or
games like the games where we

00:44:00.493 --> 00:44:03.099
were setting up incentives or
games like Nim,

00:44:03.099 --> 00:44:05.830
and we've basically been
solving these games by backward

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:09.118
induction, rather informally.
What I want to add in now is

00:44:09.118 --> 00:44:11.679
the notion of a strategy in
these games.

00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:14.569
So when we had simultaneous
move games, strategies were

00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:17.333
really unproblematic.
It was obvious what strategies

00:44:17.333 --> 00:44:19.442
were.
But when we have games which

00:44:19.442 --> 00:44:22.145
are sequential,
that go on over a period of

00:44:22.145 --> 00:44:24.436
time,
and information is emerging

00:44:24.436 --> 00:44:27.856
over a period of time,
we need to be a little careful

00:44:27.856 --> 00:44:31.875
what we mean by a strategy.
So what I want to do is I want

00:44:31.875 --> 00:44:35.079
to define a pure strategy at
least as follows.

00:44:35.079 --> 00:44:47.224
So a pure strategy for Player i
in a game of perfect

00:44:47.224 --> 00:45:00.559
information--so in the games
we've been talking about,

00:45:00.559 --> 00:45:03.810
games which we can represent by
trees is what?

00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:25.541
It's a complete plan of action.
So in other words,

00:45:25.541 --> 00:45:35.019
what it does is it specifies
which action I should

00:45:35.019 --> 00:45:46.045
take--let's not make it should
take--let's say will

00:45:46.045 --> 00:45:52.612
take,
at each of i's nodes,

00:45:52.612 --> 00:46:00.113
each of i's decision nodes.
So when you first read this

00:46:00.113 --> 00:46:03.250
definition it seems completely
uninteresting and unproblematic.

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:07.052
A pure strategy for Player i
just tells you in this game

00:46:07.052 --> 00:46:09.886
whenever you might be called
upon to move,

00:46:09.886 --> 00:46:12.789
it tells you how you're going
to move.

00:46:12.789 --> 00:46:14.632
So if you're going to move
three times in the game,

00:46:14.632 --> 00:46:16.659
it tells you how you're going
to move the first time;

00:46:16.659 --> 00:46:18.449
it tells you how you're going
to move the second time;

00:46:18.449 --> 00:46:23.820
and it tells you how you're
going to move the third time.

00:46:23.820 --> 00:46:27.212
So, so far none of this seems
difficult but actually it's a

00:46:27.212 --> 00:46:29.260
bit more difficult than it
looks.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:29.660
So let's have a look.

00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:44.103
What I want to do is I want to
look at an example,

00:46:44.103 --> 00:46:46.961
and this example I'm hoping is
going to illustrate some

00:46:46.961 --> 00:46:48.920
subtleties about this
definition.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:57.900
So here's an example.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:08.324
In this example Player 1 moves
first and they can choose in or

00:47:08.324 --> 00:47:12.528
out, or if you like let's call
it up or down since that's the

00:47:12.528 --> 00:47:16.632
way we've drawn it.
So they can choose down or

00:47:16.632 --> 00:47:20.659
up--and I'll use capital letters
U and D.

00:47:20.659 --> 00:47:29.284
If Player chooses U then Player
2 gets to move and Player 2 can

00:47:29.284 --> 00:47:34.179
choose L or R.
If Player 1 moves U followed by

00:47:34.179 --> 00:47:38.400
Player 2 choosing L,
then Player 1 gets to move,

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.193
in which case Player 1 could
move up or down and I'll use

00:47:41.193 --> 00:47:45.480
little letters this time,
u and d.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:48.250
Let's put some payoffs in this
game.

00:47:48.250 --> 00:48:00.740
So the payoffs are 1,0 here,
0,2 here, 3,1 here and 2,4

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:03.628
here.
So on paper--it's on the

00:48:03.628 --> 00:48:06.747
board--when you first look at
it, this is a perfectly simple

00:48:06.747 --> 00:48:07.978
game.
It's just like many of the

00:48:07.978 --> 00:48:09.470
games we've been looking at
since the mid-term.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:12.289
It has a tree.
We could analyze it by backward

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:15.179
induction, and in a moment we
will analyze it by backward

00:48:15.179 --> 00:48:18.004
induction.
But what I want to do first is

00:48:18.004 --> 00:48:21.739
I want to say what are the
strategies in this game?

00:48:21.739 --> 00:48:27.449
So let's start with Player 2
since it's easier.

00:48:27.449 --> 00:48:34.630
Player 2's strategies here are
what?

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:37.912
Pretty simple:
player 2 only has one decision

00:48:37.912 --> 00:48:42.464
node--here's Player 2's decision
node--and the strategy has to

00:48:42.464 --> 00:48:47.090
tell Player 2 what he's going to
do at that decision node.

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:49.469
So there's only two choices,
L or R.

00:48:49.469 --> 00:48:57.340
So Player 2's strategies are
either L or R.

00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:00.470
Notice, however,
already one slight subtlety

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:05.068
here.
Player 2 may never get to make

00:49:05.068 --> 00:49:08.560
this choice.
So Player 2 is choosing L or R,

00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.389
but Player 2 may not ever get
to make this choice.

00:49:11.389 --> 00:49:14.297
In particular,
if 1 chose D it's really

00:49:14.297 --> 00:49:17.969
irrelevant whether Player 2 has
chosen L or R.

00:49:17.969 --> 00:49:21.954
Nevertheless,
the strategy has to specify

00:49:21.954 --> 00:49:28.230
what Player 2 would do were he
called upon to make that move.

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:29.270
Now let's look at Player 1's
strategies.

00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:45.330
So what are Player 1's
strategies in this game?

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:54.300
Any takers?
Anyone want to guess?

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:59.212
So I claim it's tempting,
but it turns out to be wrong,

00:49:59.212 --> 00:50:03.670
to say that Player 1 has three
strategies here.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:08.820
It's tempting to say either
Player 1 moves D,

00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:14.440
in which case we're done,
or Player 1 moves U,

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:19.634
in which case at some later
date she may be called upon to

00:50:19.634 --> 00:50:23.471
choose u or d again.
So it's very tempting to think

00:50:23.471 --> 00:50:26.280
that Player 1 has just three
strategies here,

00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:34.314
D in which case we're done,
or U followed by either u or d,

00:50:34.314 --> 00:50:39.436
if she's reached that point.
But actually,

00:50:39.436 --> 00:50:43.899
if we follow this definition
carefully, we notice that Player

00:50:43.899 --> 00:50:46.800
1 actually has four strategies
here.

00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.904
So let me say what they are and
you'll see why it's a little

00:50:49.904 --> 00:50:52.165
odd.
So here's one of the strategies

00:50:52.165 --> 00:50:54.173
we talked about,
U followed by u,

00:50:54.173 --> 00:50:56.809
and here's another one we
talked about,

00:50:56.809 --> 00:51:03.963
U followed by d,
but I claim there are two

00:51:03.963 --> 00:51:11.989
others, D followed by u and D
followed by d.

00:51:11.989 --> 00:51:13.769
So what's a little weird about
this?

00:51:13.769 --> 00:51:18.247
What's weird is we know
perfectly well that if Player 1

00:51:18.247 --> 00:51:22.475
chooses D she's not going to get
to make the choice,

00:51:22.475 --> 00:51:27.278
the second choice u or d.
But nevertheless the strategy

00:51:27.278 --> 00:51:31.084
has to tell us what she would do
at every node,

00:51:31.084 --> 00:51:35.881
regardless of whether that node
actually is reached by that

00:51:35.881 --> 00:51:38.637
strategy.
Let me say it again,

00:51:38.637 --> 00:51:43.270
the strategy has to tell you
what Player 1 would do at that

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:46.542
node,
regardless of whether that node

00:51:46.542 --> 00:51:50.450
is actually reached by playing
that strategy.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:54.592
So a little weird.
There's a bit of redundancy

00:51:54.592 --> 00:52:02.030
here.
It's a bit redundant.

00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:05.440
Now why?
Well we'll see why in a second.

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:09.951
Let's first of all consider how
this game will be played

00:52:09.951 --> 00:52:13.900
according to backward induction.
So how do we play this game

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:18.650
according to backward induction?
Where do we start?

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:21.991
Shouldn't be a trick question,
where do we start the game

00:52:21.991 --> 00:52:25.050
according to backward induction?
At the end okay.

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:32.007
So the end here is Player 1 and
Player 1 will choose here to go

00:52:32.007 --> 00:52:36.639
d, is that right?
Because 3 is bigger than 2.

00:52:36.639 --> 00:52:40.902
So if we roll back to Player
2's move, Player 2 if she

00:52:40.902 --> 00:52:46.210
chooses L she knows that she'll
be followed by Player 1 going d,

00:52:46.210 --> 00:52:51.785
in which case she'll get 1,
but if she chooses R she'll get

00:52:51.785 --> 00:52:56.099
2.
So Player 2 will choose R.

00:52:56.099 --> 00:53:01.396
So Player 1 here,
if she chooses U then Player 2

00:53:01.396 --> 00:53:07.931
will choose R and Player 1 will
get 0, and if she chooses D

00:53:07.931 --> 00:53:12.889
she'll get 1,
so Player 1 will choose D.

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:18.789
So, backward induction suggests
that Player 1 will choose D;

00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:22.363
and followed by Player 2--if
Player 2 did get to move--she'd

00:53:22.363 --> 00:53:25.363
choose R;
followed by Player 1--if she

00:53:25.363 --> 00:53:28.780
did get to move again--choosing
d again.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:35.087
Notice that backward induction
had to tell us what Player 2

00:53:35.087 --> 00:53:39.219
would have done had she got to
move.

00:53:39.219 --> 00:53:43.338
Backward induction had to
consider what Player 2 would

00:53:43.338 --> 00:53:47.844
think that Player 1 would have
done were Player 1 to get to

00:53:47.844 --> 00:53:51.373
move again.
So to do backward induction,

00:53:51.373 --> 00:53:56.269
Player 1 has to ask herself
what Player 2 is going to do;

00:53:56.269 --> 00:54:00.103
and Player 2 has to therefore
ask herself what Player 1 would

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:02.142
have done;
which means Player 1 has to ask

00:54:02.142 --> 00:54:04.400
herself what Player 2 thinks
Player 1 would have done;

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.263
which means we actually needed
to say what Player 1 did over

00:54:09.263 --> 00:54:10.880
here.
Let me say that again.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.881
So backward induction here
tells us that Player 1 chooses D

00:54:13.881 --> 00:54:17.623
in which case the game is over.
But to do backward induction,

00:54:17.623 --> 00:54:21.480
to think through backward
induction, we really needed to

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.758
consider not just what Player 2
was going to do were he to get

00:54:25.758 --> 00:54:28.756
to move,
but also what Player 2 would

00:54:28.756 --> 00:54:33.228
think Player 1 would do were
Player 2 to get to move and were

00:54:33.228 --> 00:54:37.231
to do choose L.
So all of these redundant moves

00:54:37.231 --> 00:54:41.179
were actually part of our
backward induction.

00:54:41.179 --> 00:54:45.671
We need them there so we can
think about what people are

00:54:45.671 --> 00:54:49.240
thinking.
So backward induction tells us

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:54.403
that the outcome of the game is
D, but it tells in terms of

00:54:54.403 --> 00:54:57.371
strategies,
Player 1 chooses D and,

00:54:57.371 --> 00:55:01.340
were she to get to move again,
would choose D again.

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:12.337
And Player 2 chooses R.
Now let's analyze this game a

00:55:12.337 --> 00:55:16.269
totally different way.
We now know what the strategies

00:55:16.269 --> 00:55:19.205
are in the game:
Player 2 has two strategies,

00:55:19.205 --> 00:55:23.764
L and R;
and Player 1 has four

00:55:23.764 --> 00:55:30.139
strategies: U/u,
U/d, D/u and D/d.

00:55:30.139 --> 00:55:35.599
So let's write up the matrix
for this game,

00:55:35.599 --> 00:55:40.940
so here it is.
It must be a 4 x 2 matrix,

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:48.465
Player 2 is choosing between L
and R and Player 1 is choosing

00:55:48.465 --> 00:55:58.085
between her four strategies Uu,
Ud, Du and Dd and we can put

00:55:58.085 --> 00:56:07.033
all the payoffs in.
So (Uu,L) gets us here which is

00:56:07.033 --> 00:56:15.565
(2,4).
(Uu,R) gets us here which is

00:56:15.565 --> 00:56:23.673
(0,2).
(Ud,L) gets us here which is

00:56:23.673 --> 00:56:29.753
(3,1).
(Ud,R) gets us here again which

00:56:29.753 --> 00:56:32.565
is (0,2).
And Du gets us,

00:56:32.565 --> 00:56:37.714
going right out of the game
immediately, so we're going to

00:56:37.714 --> 00:56:42.320
go to (1,0).
And in fact that's also true

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:49.168
for (Du,R), and it's also true
for (Dd,L) and it's also true

00:56:49.168 --> 00:56:52.706
for (D/d,R).
So all of these four strategies

00:56:52.706 --> 00:56:55.489
at the bottom started off by
Player 1 choosing D,

00:56:55.489 --> 00:56:59.173
in which case the game is over.
So once again in this matrix

00:56:59.173 --> 00:57:02.599
you can kind of see the
redundancy I was talking about.

00:57:02.599 --> 00:57:06.284
In this matrix,
the third row,

00:57:06.284 --> 00:57:11.620
the Du row looks the same as
the Dd row.

00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:17.918
Everyone happy with that?
So when we've had matrices in

00:57:17.918 --> 00:57:20.800
the past how have we solved the
game?

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.997
Well we've been doing this
backward induction stuff for a

00:57:22.997 --> 00:57:23.900
couple of weeks,
but,

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:27.941
prior to the mid-term--if I had
given you this on the mid-term

00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:31.452
what would you have done?
You'd look for a Nash

00:57:31.452 --> 00:57:33.968
Equilibrium right?
So let's do that:

00:57:33.968 --> 00:57:35.829
let's look for Nash
Equilibrium.

00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:45.730
So if Player 2 chooses L then
Player 1's best response is Uu;

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:53.169
and if Player 2 chooses R,
then Player 1's best response

00:57:53.169 --> 00:57:58.870
is either Du or Dd.
Conversely, if Player 1 chooses

00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:02.469
Uu then Player 2's best response
is L.

00:58:02.469 --> 00:58:09.469
If Player 1 chooses Ud then
Player 2's best response is R.

00:58:09.469 --> 00:58:13.936
If Player 1 chooses Du then
Player 2 doesn't care because

00:58:13.936 --> 00:58:19.426
they're getting 0 anyway;
and if Player 1 chooses Dd then

00:58:19.426 --> 00:58:25.023
again Player 2 doesn't care
because they're getting 0

00:58:25.023 --> 00:58:28.433
anyway.
So the Nash Equilibria in this

00:58:28.433 --> 00:58:33.593
game are what?
So one of them is here,

00:58:33.593 --> 00:58:44.071
so that's one Nash Equilibrium.
One of them is Dd followed by

00:58:44.071 --> 00:58:54.423
R, and that's a Nash Equilibrium
we actually found by backward

00:58:54.423 --> 00:58:59.800
induction.
The Nash Equilibrium (Dd,R)

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:06.260
corresponds to the one we found
by backward induction.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:08.969
But there's another Nash
Equilibrium in this game.

00:59:08.969 --> 00:59:14.680
The other Nash Equilibrium in
this game is this one.

00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.539
That's also a Nash Equilibrium.
What does it involve?

00:59:17.539 --> 00:59:35.980
It involves Du and R--sorry Du
and R.

00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:38.230
So what happened in that
equilibrium?

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:41.454
Player 1 went down which made
everything else kind of

00:59:41.454 --> 00:59:45.723
irrelevant.
Player 2 played R and Player 1

00:59:45.723 --> 00:59:52.190
in their plan of action was
actually going to choose u.

00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:55.601
Say it again,
Player 1 in fact went D,

00:59:55.601 --> 01:00:01.226
Player 2 had they got to move
would have chosen R and Player 1

01:00:01.226 --> 01:00:07.219
had they got to move at this
second time would have chosen u.

01:00:07.219 --> 01:00:08.659
So how can that be a Nash
Equilibrium?

01:00:08.659 --> 01:00:11.139
It doesn't correspond to
backward induction.

01:00:11.139 --> 01:00:15.631
In particular,
Player 1 up here is choosing a

01:00:15.631 --> 01:00:21.143
strategy that seems silly.
They're choosing u rather than

01:00:21.143 --> 01:00:24.239
d which gets them 2 rather than
3.

01:00:24.239 --> 01:00:28.016
So how could it possibly be
that that's an equilibrium

01:00:28.016 --> 01:00:30.322
strategy?
The reason is--the reason it

01:00:30.322 --> 01:00:33.694
can be an equilibrium strategy
is it doesn't really matter what

01:00:33.694 --> 01:00:37.011
Player 1 chooses up here from
Player 1's point of view because

01:00:37.011 --> 01:00:39.349
it's never going to be reached
anyway.

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:43.445
As long as Player 2 is going to
choose R here,

01:00:43.445 --> 01:00:49.269
it really doesn't matter what
Player 1 decides to do up there.

01:00:49.269 --> 01:00:51.230
From Player 1's point of view,
it doesn't make a difference.

01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:56.937
It isn't reached anyway.
So we're highlighting here a

01:00:56.937 --> 01:01:01.820
danger, and the danger is this.
If you just mechanically find

01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:06.616
the Nash Equilibria in a game,
you're going to find people

01:01:06.616 --> 01:01:12.044
choosing actions that,
if they ever were called upon

01:01:12.044 --> 01:01:14.909
to make them,
are silly.

01:01:14.909 --> 01:01:17.059
Say it again,
if you just mechanically find

01:01:17.059 --> 01:01:19.967
the Nash Equilibria in the game,
just as we did here,

01:01:19.967 --> 01:01:23.354
you're going to select some
actions, in this case an action

01:01:23.354 --> 01:01:26.150
by Player 1,
that were she called upon to

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:29.030
take that action would be a
silly action.

01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:33.988
The reason it's surviving our
analysis is because in fact she

01:01:33.988 --> 01:01:38.506
isn't called upon to make it.
Now to make that more concrete,

01:01:38.506 --> 01:01:42.040
let's take this to an economic
example, this same idea.

01:01:57.150 --> 01:02:02.222
So what I want you to imagine
is a market, and in this market

01:02:02.222 --> 01:02:06.280
there is a monopolist who
controls the market,

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:10.878
but there's an entrant who is
thinking of entering into this

01:02:10.878 --> 01:02:14.206
market.
So right now this market has a

01:02:14.206 --> 01:02:17.620
monopoly in it,
and the monopolist is an

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:22.085
incumbent--let's call him
Inc--and an entrant who is

01:02:22.085 --> 01:02:27.426
trying to decide whether or not
to enter the market or whether

01:02:27.426 --> 01:02:31.110
to stay out.
If they stay out then the

01:02:31.110 --> 01:02:35.473
entrant gets nothing and the
incumbent continues to get

01:02:35.473 --> 01:02:40.634
monopoly profits.
So think of this as 3 million a

01:02:40.634 --> 01:02:43.592
year.
If the entrant enters then the

01:02:43.592 --> 01:02:46.320
incumbent can do one of two
things.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.417
The incumbent could choose to
fight the entrant,

01:02:49.417 --> 01:02:52.713
by which I mean charge low
prices, advertise a lot,

01:02:52.713 --> 01:02:55.349
try and drive him out of the
market.

01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:58.252
He could play very
competitively,

01:02:58.252 --> 01:03:02.878
in which case the entrant will
actually make losses,

01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:08.139
and the incumbent will drive
her profits down to zero.

01:03:08.139 --> 01:03:13.159
Conversely, the incumbent could
choose not to fight.

01:03:13.159 --> 01:03:17.156
If they don't fight then
they'll simply share the market

01:03:17.156 --> 01:03:20.789
and they'll both make,
let's say Cournot profits or

01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:23.550
duopoly profits of a million
each.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:25.638
So in this game,
let's just say again,

01:03:25.638 --> 01:03:29.015
there's a market there.
The monopolist is in the market

01:03:29.015 --> 01:03:32.564
and the monopolist is making 3
million a year which seems

01:03:32.564 --> 01:03:36.570
pretty nice for the monopolist.
The entrant is trying to decide

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:40.435
whether to invade this market.
If she invades this market,

01:03:40.435 --> 01:03:44.466
if she's fought she's in
trouble, but if the monopolist

01:03:44.466 --> 01:03:47.955
accommodates her,
then they just go to duopoly

01:03:47.955 --> 01:03:51.733
profits and the entrant does
very well, gets a million

01:03:51.733 --> 01:03:55.130
dollars in profit.
Let's have a look at this game.

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:58.978
Analyze--first of all this
time, let's analyze it by Nash

01:03:58.978 --> 01:04:02.112
Equilibrium.
So I claim in this game,

01:04:02.112 --> 01:04:07.090
this is pretty simple:
the entrant has two strategies.

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:08.889
I'll put it straight into the
matrix.

01:04:08.889 --> 01:04:19.166
The entrant has two strategies,
they're either to go in or to

01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:24.390
stay out;
and the incumbent has two

01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:32.007
strategies, they are either to
fight the entrant or not to

01:04:32.007 --> 01:04:34.586
fight.
The payoffs of this game are as

01:04:34.586 --> 01:04:38.536
follows--let's put them in.
In and fight was (-1,0),

01:04:38.536 --> 01:04:44.739
in and not fight was (1,1) and
out led to the incumbents

01:04:44.739 --> 01:04:48.800
maintaining the monopoly
profits.

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:52.550
Let's have a look at the Nash
Equilibria of this game.

01:04:52.550 --> 01:04:56.231
So the first thing to do is to
look at the best responses for

01:04:56.231 --> 01:04:59.637
the entrant.
So if the incumbent chooses

01:04:59.637 --> 01:05:04.920
fight, then the entrant's best
response is to stay out.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:11.228
If the incumbent chooses not
fight, then the entrant's best

01:05:11.228 --> 01:05:15.519
response is to enter.
How about for the incumbent?

01:05:15.519 --> 01:05:20.180
If the entrant chooses to come
in then the incumbent's best

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:24.519
response is not to fight because
1 is bigger than 0.

01:05:24.519 --> 01:05:30.080
But if the entrant stays out it
really doesn't matter what the

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.000
incumbent does,
they'll get 3 either way.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:42.190
So the Nash Equilibria here are
either in followed by not

01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:50.088
fighting, you end up with a
duopoly, or out followed by

01:05:50.088 --> 01:05:54.573
fighting.
Of course the fight doesn't

01:05:54.573 --> 01:05:59.931
take place: out followed by "we
would have fought had you

01:05:59.931 --> 01:06:02.085
entered."
So these are the Nash

01:06:02.085 --> 01:06:04.779
Equilibria.
Let's analyze this game by

01:06:04.779 --> 01:06:08.958
backward induction.
From the incumbent's point of

01:06:08.958 --> 01:06:14.406
view, if the incumbent gets to
move then is she going to choose

01:06:14.406 --> 01:06:19.340
fight or not fight?
She's going to choose not

01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:23.900
fight, so the entrant should do
what?

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.946
Somebody?
The entrant should enter,

01:06:25.946 --> 01:06:28.809
because if she enters she gets
1, if she stays out she gets 0.

01:06:28.809 --> 01:06:41.659
So backward induction just
gives us this equilibrium.

01:06:41.659 --> 01:06:44.850
Now the question is what do we
think is going on with this

01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:48.420
other equilibrium?
Let's talk it through.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.407
So here you are,
you're about to enter the

01:06:50.407 --> 01:06:52.880
market, you leave Yale,
you set up your business,

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:56.217
and your business is
challenging some monopolist or

01:06:56.217 --> 01:06:58.820
quasi-monopolist like Microsoft
say.,

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.575
And you go out there and you're
about to put out your new

01:07:01.575 --> 01:07:04.380
operating system.
And you know that your new

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:07.976
operating system will make
plenty of money provided

01:07:07.976 --> 01:07:12.148
Microsoft doesn't retaliate and
drop its prices by half and

01:07:12.148 --> 01:07:16.190
advertise you out of the market.
So what does Bill Gates do?

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:17.679
Bill Gates is the head of
Microsoft.

01:07:17.679 --> 01:07:21.572
He says, wait a second before
you graduate from Yale and go

01:07:21.572 --> 01:07:24.927
set up this company,
let me just tell you I'm going

01:07:24.927 --> 01:07:30.150
to fight.
If you enter I'm going to fight.

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:34.225
And if you believe him,
if you believe that he's going

01:07:34.225 --> 01:07:37.412
to fight, what should you do?
You're not going to bother to

01:07:37.412 --> 01:07:39.407
enter his market.
And if you believe that you're

01:07:39.407 --> 01:07:42.253
going to get fought by Bill
Gates then you believe that if

01:07:42.253 --> 01:07:44.300
you enter you're going to make
losses,

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:49.771
so you choose to stay out.
And this threat that Bill Gates

01:07:49.771 --> 01:07:55.020
makes here it doesn't cost him
anything, provided you go out,

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:58.869
he doesn't actually have to
fight at all.

01:07:58.869 --> 01:08:02.371
That's why it is in fact an
equilibrium to imagine you

01:08:02.371 --> 01:08:06.005
staying out believing that
you're going to get fought if

01:08:06.005 --> 01:08:08.980
you enter,
and it is a best response for

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:12.940
the guy to fight knowing that
you're going to stay out.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:17.119
But this doesn't sound right.
Why doesn't this sound right?

01:08:17.119 --> 01:08:21.403
It doesn't sound right because
you really shouldn't believe the

01:08:21.403 --> 01:08:25.618
guy who says he's going to fight
you when you know that if you

01:08:25.618 --> 01:08:29.350
did enter fighting would cost
the incumbent money.

01:08:29.350 --> 01:08:32.979
If you did enter,
if he fights you he gets 0,

01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:36.939
if he doesn't fight he gets a
million dollars.

01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:41.802
So this threat that the guy is
going to fight you,

01:08:41.802 --> 01:08:51.078
this threat is not credible.
This is an equilibrium but it

01:08:51.078 --> 01:09:00.200
relies on believing an
incredible threat.

01:09:10.529 --> 01:09:13.581
It's true that if you think
about entering the market that

01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:15.883
Microsoft is in,
you're very likely to get a

01:09:15.883 --> 01:09:18.998
little email from Bill Gates.
(But it won't be an email

01:09:18.998 --> 01:09:21.694
because that can be taken to
Court, but some little

01:09:21.694 --> 01:09:24.930
threatening remark in your ear
from Bill Gates.) It's true if

01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:28.220
you entered into the market that
the people who build aircraft

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:30.582
in,
the head of Boeing might pay

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:33.185
you a call one day or send
someone round,

01:09:33.185 --> 01:09:36.180
but these threats are not
credible threats.

01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.597
Is that right?
They're not credible threats

01:09:38.597 --> 01:09:42.579
because we know that if you did
enter, it isn't in their

01:09:42.579 --> 01:09:46.188
interest to fight.
They're making a lot of noise

01:09:46.188 --> 01:09:49.283
about it but you know that if
you did enter,

01:09:49.283 --> 01:09:53.460
backward induction tells us
they're not going to fight.

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:57.111
But now we're in slightly an
odd situation,

01:09:57.111 --> 01:10:01.010
why are we in an odd situation?
Two things.

01:10:01.010 --> 01:10:06.635
One, we seem to be finding that
there are Nash Equilibria in

01:10:06.635 --> 01:10:11.879
games--we found one here and one
up here--there are Nash

01:10:11.879 --> 01:10:17.600
Equilibria that are not
supported by backward induction.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:21.465
That's the first reason we're a
little worried here,

01:10:21.465 --> 01:10:25.937
and the second reason we're
worried is even the economics of

01:10:25.937 --> 01:10:29.466
this doesn't quite smell right.
For example,

01:10:29.466 --> 01:10:31.729
if you in fact did
enter--sorry,

01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:35.890
if you did in fact announce you
were going to operate,

01:10:35.890 --> 01:10:38.921
you were going to build a new
operating system and got a

01:10:38.921 --> 01:10:42.339
threatening phone call from Bill
Gates--there might be a reason

01:10:42.339 --> 01:10:44.820
why you might actually believe
that call.

01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:52.829
Why might you believe that call?
Can we get a mike out,

01:10:52.829 --> 01:10:56.002
I'll do it.
So why might you believe a call

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:59.297
from Bill Gates saying he's
going to beat you up--not beat

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:02.708
you up but he's going to charge
low prices if you produce an

01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:05.336
operating system?
Student: If you look at

01:11:05.336 --> 01:11:07.960
the future revenue streams,
like for the next ten years and

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:10.899
he consistently gets 1 million
dollars for the next ten years,

01:11:10.899 --> 01:11:13.719
he would be better off if he
just drove you out of the market

01:11:13.719 --> 01:11:16.585
for the first year and then get
3 million dollars for the next

01:11:16.585 --> 01:11:17.814
nine years.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:11:17.814 --> 01:11:18.689
That wasn't quite what I wasn't
thinking of.

01:11:18.689 --> 01:11:22.248
Okay, it's true if we cheat a
bit and make one of the--Okay,

01:11:22.248 --> 01:11:25.506
so what you're saying is I
could get 3 forever versus 1

01:11:25.506 --> 01:11:27.639
forever,
assume these are both present

01:11:27.639 --> 01:11:29.729
discounted values of future cash
earnings.

01:11:29.729 --> 01:11:33.569
So we've done the future cash
flow analysis of this.

01:11:33.569 --> 01:11:37.400
So this isn't an accounting
mistake, not for accounting

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.002
reasons.
There's some other reason when

01:11:40.002 --> 01:11:43.220
Gates threatens you,
you might want to believe it.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:45.840
Let's try up here first.
Student: He can afford

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.239
to make an example of you so no
other people will invade.

01:11:48.239 --> 01:11:50.785
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, so one thing that's in

01:11:50.785 --> 01:11:54.546
Bill Gates' mind is right now,
he's thinking about competing

01:11:54.546 --> 01:11:59.001
with you but down the road
there's a lot more of you guys

01:11:59.001 --> 01:12:02.508
coming--whatever it is,
280 of you in this room and

01:12:02.508 --> 01:12:05.279
there's another 280 in next
year's class and so on.

01:12:05.279 --> 01:12:08.681
And Bill Gates knows that each
of you might come out and

01:12:08.681 --> 01:12:11.649
threaten his monopoly,
his Microsoft monopoly.

01:12:11.649 --> 01:12:15.541
And he might think that by
setting an example to one of you

01:12:15.541 --> 01:12:18.359
he might be able to keep the
others out.

01:12:18.359 --> 01:12:22.814
And somewhere that kind of
argument, the argument of making

01:12:22.814 --> 01:12:25.733
an example of somebody is
missing here:

01:12:25.733 --> 01:12:29.497
missing completely.
But it's got to be important,

01:12:29.497 --> 01:12:31.840
it's got to be an important
idea.

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:35.354
So we're going to come back and
spend the first half of

01:12:35.354 --> 01:12:39.000
Wednesday's class picking up
just precisely that idea.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.567
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So as you
know, we're getting on to ionic 

00:00:05.567 --> 00:00:09.067
reactions, and started by
talking about how important 

00:00:09.067 --> 00:00:11.333
the solvent is. 

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.533
We started last time looking at
the example of the 

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:18.667
disassociation of water into
ions to give H+ and O-H-, 

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:21.400
both, of course, solvated. 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.467
We're interested in the
important role that the 

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.033
solvent plays. 

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:27.933
We saw last time that we could
talk about 

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.833
water in the gas phase. 

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:33.333
Dissociating into radicals, we
know the bond 

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.167
dissociation energy. 

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.433
Then transferring an electron. 

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.367
And most importantly, then
getting the two ions apart 

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:45.633
from one another, which is going
to cost 332 kilocalories 

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.733
per mole just to get them apart
from being like one 

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:51.767
Å to infinitely apart. 

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:55.367
Altogether those processes cost
392 

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:57.233
kilocalories per mole. 

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.900
So that would be absolutely out
of the question. 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.467
In fact, even once you start in
the gas phase it's 386, so 

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:09.033
that would be 10^-290. 

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:10.233
Impossible. 

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:13.567
But the solvent makes it
possible-- you know that water 

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:16.367
dissociates. 

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:21.467
So when you put another water
molecule, which is a dipole, 

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:25.233
next to the O-H-, it makes it
more stable. 

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:29.533
We talked about that last time
or two times ago how you get 

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:33.533
hydrogen bonding between a
hydroxide anion and a water. 

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:37.233
So it's more, in that case, more
than just a dipole. 

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:40.433
Remember it was that double
minimum that, in fact, the 

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:43.967
lowest energy level had the
hydrogen in the middle. 

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:47.467
Anyhow, that's not fabulously
strong; it's not like a 

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:50.567
covalent bond, but it's 28
kilocalories per mole, which 

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:52.433
is nothing to sneeze at. 

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.567
If you put another water on that
you get another 18 

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:57.167
kilocalories per mole. 

00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:59.267
And if you put another and
another and another and 

00:01:59.267 --> 00:02:04.067
another and they line up, you
get stability by 106 

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:09.567
kilocalories per mole for
solvating the hydroxide ion, 

00:02:09.567 --> 00:02:10.733
to put it in water. 

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:15.267
So that's worth more than most
covalent bonds. 

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:18.800
Now you also have the proton
that could be solvated. 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800
That one actually forms a bond--

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.767
you can form a bond between the
unshared pair on the water 

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:26.567
that's coming up and the H+. 

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:29.000
That bond is, in fact, a very
strong bond. 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.033
It's 164 kilocalories per mole--
about twice as strong 

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.233
as most covalent bond. 

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:39.067
Because it's not only a bond, it
also gets the positive 

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:42.733
charge in close proximity to a
bunch of other electrons. 

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:44.800
So it polarizes them. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.000
That's a little bit like
solvation within the molecule. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.700
So you get 164 just for the
first water onto a proton. 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.667
Then, of course, that looks
rather-- it's charged and it's 

00:02:57.667 --> 00:03:00.233
not very much bigger than the
O-H-. 

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:02.633
So it's not going to surprise
you that you can put more 

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:04.533
waters onto that. 

00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:09.067
And from doing a whole bunch of
waters to put it into 

00:03:09.067 --> 00:03:12.833
liquid water, you get another
100 kilocalories per mole on 

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:16.133
top of what you got forming
H3O+. 

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:21.900
So if we sum all those together,
164, 106 and 100-- 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.967
notice that those are similar to
one another-- 

00:03:23.967 --> 00:03:28.000
we get 370 kilocalories per
mole. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.567
That means we get the energy of
forming the proton and the 

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:36.467
hydroxide if they're solvated
down to within only 21 and a 

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:40.233
half kilocalories of the water
in water. 

00:03:43.133 --> 00:03:47.800
So that means the pKa is 15.8,
you know. 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.600
But it has enormously to do with
solvation, 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.300
as you can see here. 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.267
It's, in fact, very delicately
balanced. 

00:03:56.267 --> 00:04:01.267
It's a small difference, this 22
kilocalories per mole, of 

00:04:01.267 --> 00:04:04.633
very large numbers, things that
total 392 

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:06.200
kilocalories per mole. 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.800
So if any of these steps had
been off by a few percent, the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.600
dissociation of water would be
very different. 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.667
So this is a sign that you have
to be careful, because 

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:22.667
whenever you're dealing with
small differences that come 

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:26.900
from very large effects in the
first place, it 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.967
could go any place. 

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:31.233
In the case of water it happens
to be that water will 

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:34.033
dissociate with a dissociation

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.000
constant of [correction:
10^16] 16. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.333
But it has to be regarded mostly
as an accident because 

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:45.467
of this important role of
solvation. 

00:04:45.467 --> 00:04:48.967
Now we're going to generalize
into Brønsted acidity-- 

00:04:48.967 --> 00:04:51.200
other things giving up protons.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.767
Or you could call it
substitution at hydrogen. 

00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:55.733
Here's HF-- 

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:59.367
and we talked about this last
semester ad infinitum, of how

00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:02.733
we could make and break a bond
at the same time by bringing 

00:05:02.733 --> 00:05:06.700
up, say, water, and get H3O+ and
F-. 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.167
That is, HF acting as an acid,
hydrofluoric acid. 

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:13.000
So that's Brønsted acidity, 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.167
giving up a proton, but it could
be thought of as 

00:05:17.167 --> 00:05:18.800
substitution at hydrogen-- 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.967
something new comes in, the old
thing leaves, 

00:05:20.967 --> 00:05:24.767
fluoride in this case. 

00:05:24.767 --> 00:05:27.700
Now this happens, of course, in
a solvent. 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.900
Just as in the case of water, HF
isn't going to disassociate 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.700
to H+ and F- in the gas phase. 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.433
It's the stabilization of those
ions by water that make 

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:40.067
this accessible. 

00:05:40.067 --> 00:05:42.967
So is it going to be like water
where you have these 

00:05:42.967 --> 00:05:45.600
enormous things and there's no
predicting what will happen, 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.367
as to how strong the acid will
be? 

00:05:48.367 --> 00:05:50.700
To a certain extent that's true.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.900
But fortunately, the solvation
energies of analogous 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.767
compounds are similar enough
that we can often make 

00:05:58.767 --> 00:06:01.067
reasonably accurate
predictions-- 

00:06:01.067 --> 00:06:03.967
or at least if not predict, at
least once we've seen the 

00:06:03.967 --> 00:06:07.267
results we could rationalize
them reasonably-- 

00:06:07.267 --> 00:06:10.933
of the relative acidities in
terms of molecular structures. 

00:06:10.933 --> 00:06:14.700
That is, if we can cancel out,
because they're very similar, 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.533
all these solvation things, then
we can look at the 

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:21.767
molecules themselves and try to
understand why one is more 

00:06:21.767 --> 00:06:22.900
acidic than another. 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.267
That's what we'd like to be able
to do because it's much 

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:27.967
simpler to think about just the
molecule than to think 

00:06:27.967 --> 00:06:30.967
about how all the solvents would
be arranged around any 

00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:33.867
particular molecule or ion. 

00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:35.833
So let's try that. 

00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:40.533
Now as background for talking
about acid you've, in your AP 

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:45.600
chemistry, looked at pH and pKa,
and there's the question 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.533
why should organic chemists
bother about pH and pKa, which 

00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:53.533
you've already done in your AP.

00:06:53.533 --> 00:06:55.167
It seems like a topic for
general 

00:06:55.167 --> 00:06:57.467
chemistry, not organic
chemistry. 

00:06:57.467 --> 00:07:00.267
But there are several reasons
why it's important in organic 

00:07:00.267 --> 00:07:02.800
chemistry, and I'm sure that all
those various textbooks 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.467
you have have a chapter, a
section, 

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.733
about Brønsted acidity. 

00:07:08.733 --> 00:07:12.800
Because in the first place,
whether a molecule is ionized 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.000
or not is important for
predicting reactivity-- 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
that is, the availability of
HOMOs and LUMOs-- 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.133
how high, how low they'll be
depends on 

00:07:21.133 --> 00:07:22.833
whether it's an ion. 

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:26.967
Also things like conformation,
the color, the proximity to 

00:07:26.967 --> 00:07:29.667
other species, mobility,
particularly if you're an 

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:33.300
electric field, is a big
function of 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.133
whether there's a charge. 

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:37.267
So you want to know whether
molecules are ionized or not. 

00:07:37.267 --> 00:07:39.533
One of the simplest ways of
making ions is 

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:42.467
dissociating a proton. 

00:07:42.467 --> 00:07:46.067
And because the ease with which
a species reacts with a 

00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:49.500
proton might predict how readily
it 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.200
reacts with other LUMOs. 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.767
So often we're not specifically
interested in how 

00:07:56.767 --> 00:08:00.933
easily a proton would react with
some high HOMO, but we 

00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:03.933
are interested in how someone
else would react. 

00:08:03.933 --> 00:08:06.867
And if we're comparing two high
HOMOs to see which one's 

00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:10.033
more reactive, it wouldn't be
surprising if the one that's 

00:08:10.033 --> 00:08:13.767
more reactive with a proton is
also more reactive with the 

00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:16.400
molecule we're interested in. 

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.000
So if we can easily measure
reactivity with a proton, the 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.433
reverse of which is acidity, if
we can easily measure that 

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:29.500
equilibrium, then we have a
scale to talk about how low 

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.667
LUMOs are, how reactive LUMOs
might be. 

00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:35.933
So that's why acidity is
particularly important in 

00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:37.367
organic chemistry, because it
could 

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:39.067
predict organic reactions. 

00:08:39.067 --> 00:08:43.767
That is, reaction with the LUMO
sigma* CX or pi* 

00:08:43.767 --> 00:08:49.400
CO might parallel the reactivity
with a proton. 

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.733
Now we know that the acid
dissociation constant is the 

00:08:52.733 --> 00:08:56.767
product of [H+] and [B-] over
[HB] where B is some base 

00:08:56.767 --> 00:08:59.667
or HB an acid. 

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:03.633
And if we take the logs of both
sides and rearrange a 

00:09:03.633 --> 00:09:08.267
little bit, we see that the pH
is the pKa minus the log of 

00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:09.367
the ratio-- 

00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:12.367
how much of the stuff is ionized
and how much of the 

00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:15.100
stuff is in the acidic form. 

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:21.233
If that ratio is 1, if it's half
ionized, then the log of 

00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:23.833
1 is zero so we forget that. 

00:09:23.833 --> 00:09:26.800
And then pH is equal to pKa. 

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.933
So we have an acid with a
certain pKa. 

00:09:29.933 --> 00:09:34.300
If the pH is that value, then
you have 50:50 ionized and 

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.967
unionized form. 

00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:41.433
Now you often use things like
that as indicators. 

00:09:41.433 --> 00:09:45.000
It might be that the ionic form
is colored or has a 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.467
different color from the
protonated form. 

00:09:48.467 --> 00:09:51.533
Then if you see that color or
not and can measure its 

00:09:51.533 --> 00:09:54.367
intensity, you can tell how much
is ionized. 

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:57.600
So you could measure that ratio.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.833
But you can't measure it over a
really wide range, because 

00:10:02.833 --> 00:10:06.833
suppose you could measure it
when there's 5% of the colored 

00:10:06.833 --> 00:10:11.367
species or up to 95%, but beyond
that the colors aren't 

00:10:11.367 --> 00:10:13.267
distinguishable. 

00:10:13.267 --> 00:10:15.100
That would be fairly reasonable.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:21.067
So if you go from 95:5 to 5:95
that covers just this ratio, 

00:10:21.067 --> 00:10:24.033
that covers just 2 and a half pH
units. 

00:10:24.033 --> 00:10:28.133
So if you want to use an
indicator to measure the pH of 

00:10:28.133 --> 00:10:31.000
something, you can only measure
it with that indicator 

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.300
over a very narrow range by
measuring the ratio of how 

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.533
much colored to uncolored stuff
there is. 

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:41.800
Beyond that you have to get some
other indicator and then 

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.267
some other indicator and some
other indicator. 

00:10:44.267 --> 00:10:47.467
So you could have a ladder of
indicators that allows you to 

00:10:47.467 --> 00:10:50.567
cover a wide range of pH. 

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:54.933
And then you could bootstrap
that way with overlapping 

00:10:54.933 --> 00:10:57.367
indicators to get a wide
coverage. 

00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:04.567
So with a known pKa, you measure
the pH by measuring 

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:09.033
the ratio of the ions-- ionized
to the unionized form. 

00:11:09.033 --> 00:11:13.500
Now let's look at factors that
influence the acidity, because 

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.733
they may also be the ones that
influence reactivity and other 

00:11:16.733 --> 00:11:19.667
organic reactions. 

00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:22.567
Now pKa normally is defined in
water. 

00:11:26.367 --> 00:11:28.867
We just saw that the
dissociation constant for 

00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:31.167
water in water, that is, losing
the red 

00:11:31.167 --> 00:11:35.133
proton there, is 15.7. 

00:11:35.133 --> 00:11:38.500
Now if you tried to get the pH
higher than 

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.867
that, what would happen? 

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:47.633
If you had water and you made
its pH 20, let's say, or 18 

00:11:47.633 --> 00:11:52.033
instead of some place in this
range, what would happen? 

00:11:52.033 --> 00:11:54.067
You'd have the strong base in
there. 

00:11:54.067 --> 00:11:57.467
That base would pull protons off
the water, and you 

00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.700
wouldn't have any water anymore.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.233
So it wouldn't be anything like
the same solvent if you 

00:12:03.233 --> 00:12:07.133
tried to get higher pH than
that. 

00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:10.867
And the same thing is true if
you look at the dissociation 

00:12:10.867 --> 00:12:13.467
constant of H3O+. 

00:12:13.467 --> 00:12:20.033
At a pH of -1.7 it would be 50%
protonated. 

00:12:20.033 --> 00:12:25.367
But if water is 50% protonated
it's not water anymore. 

00:12:25.367 --> 00:12:30.233
So if you're within this range
between, say, zero and 15 or 

00:12:30.233 --> 00:12:34.100
something like that, then you
have water and you can talk 

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.167
about things. 

00:12:35.167 --> 00:12:38.033
But if you tried to get out of
that, you can't use water 

00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:40.800
anymore because all you're doing
is making all 

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.333
the water into ions. 

00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:45.367
But in that range you can work.

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:48.200
So in that range there are a
number of interesting things, 

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.700
like ammonia can be protonated.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:54.100
The ammonium ion has a pKa of
9.2. 

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.000
So at pH 9.2 half of ammonia is
protonated, the ammonium 

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.567
ion, half of it is NH3. 

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.200
Does it surprise you-- 

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.867
now let's get this straight. 

00:13:05.867 --> 00:13:13.567
So NH4 acting as an acid, in
NH4+ is 9.2. 

00:13:13.567 --> 00:13:17.167
H3O+ is -1.7. 

00:13:17.167 --> 00:13:20.067
Which one gives up its proton
more easily? 

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:28.033
H3O+ or NH4+? 

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:29.300
Which is a stronger acid? 

00:13:34.767 --> 00:13:38.733
Which one would take the proton
from the other one? 

00:13:38.733 --> 00:13:40.533
Debbie, do you have an idea? 

00:13:40.533 --> 00:13:41.967
STUDENT: I guess H3O+ is a
stronger acid. 

00:13:44.933 --> 00:13:45.367
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:13:45.367 --> 00:13:48.633
So it would protonate NH3. 

00:13:48.633 --> 00:13:54.733
So if you had H3O+ and NH3, it
would be downhill in energy to 

00:13:54.733 --> 00:13:57.300
transfer the proton to the NH3.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.800
Why? 

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:05.133
Why is it better to put the
proton onto NH3 than onto H2O? 

00:14:05.133 --> 00:14:06.367
What is it about NH3? 

00:14:11.733 --> 00:14:13.067
That makes that a stronger bond.

00:14:18.067 --> 00:14:20.967
So you have a proton plus
something that has an unshared 

00:14:20.967 --> 00:14:24.767
pair, they come together in the
form of a bond. 

00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:26.833
How much energy are you going to
get out of that bond? 

00:14:29.833 --> 00:14:32.133
The proton is the same in all
cases. 

00:14:32.133 --> 00:14:34.967
What difference is there in the
unshared pair between 

00:14:34.967 --> 00:14:38.000
nitrogen and oxygen that means
that nitrogen will hold the 

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.900
proton more strongly. 

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:39.333
Sebastian? 

00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:40.733
STUDENT: It's a higher HOMO
because nitrogen has a lower 

00:14:40.733 --> 00:14:42.267
nuclear charge. 

00:14:42.267 --> 00:14:42.767
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:14:42.767 --> 00:14:47.033
Lower nuclear charge, higher
HOMO, stronger bond. 

00:14:47.033 --> 00:14:49.933
Better energy match. 

00:14:49.933 --> 00:14:51.933
So we understand that difference
here 

00:14:51.933 --> 00:15:01.233
of about 11 pH units. 

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:06.200
Here's FH, 3.2, hydrofluoric
acid. 

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.133
Not nearly as good an acid as
H3O+. 

00:15:10.733 --> 00:15:19.367
But it's a lot better acid than
H-O-H, than water, by 12 

00:15:19.367 --> 00:15:22.500
and a half powers of 10. 

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:25.833
The reason is the same. 

00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:29.367
That oxygen has a higher HOMO
and holds 

00:15:29.367 --> 00:15:30.867
the proton more strongly. 

00:15:30.867 --> 00:15:34.533
So we can understand that. 

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:39.067
H2S is 7.0.

00:15:39.067 --> 00:15:47.167
‘So now that seems a little
funny compared with water. 

00:15:47.167 --> 00:15:51.700
But notice the bond association
energies. 

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:55.067
Actually, it's reasonable-- 

00:15:55.067 --> 00:15:57.500
sulfur is not as electronegative
as oxygen. 

00:15:59.967 --> 00:16:05.800
Its HOMO is lower. 

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.200
Pardon me, let me get this
straight. 

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.967
You always have to think these
things through. 

00:16:09.967 --> 00:16:13.533
I realize I'm rattling it off
quite fast, and it'll take a 

00:16:13.533 --> 00:16:16.367
little while looking this over
in your own room to get it 

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:17.900
straight in your head. 

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.767
But it's interesting that if you
look at the bond 

00:16:21.767 --> 00:16:24.367
dissociation energies, sulfur is

00:16:24.367 --> 00:16:27.600
between oxygen and fluorine. 

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.067
So it's more than just how
strong the bond is that 

00:16:32.067 --> 00:16:34.467
determined sulfur to be in the
middle. 

00:16:34.467 --> 00:16:36.600
So we're going to talk a little
bit about that. 

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.833
So here are hydrogen attached to
various elements, and we're 

00:16:40.833 --> 00:16:43.800
going to look at the pKa's. 

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.167
Now if we go across the top row
you see that the ease of 

00:16:48.167 --> 00:16:50.867
heterolysis, how strong an acid
it is, 

00:16:50.867 --> 00:16:52.700
increases to the right. 

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.967
So it gets easier to break the
bond into ions as 

00:16:55.967 --> 00:16:57.567
you go to the right. 

00:16:57.567 --> 00:17:01.100
But if you look at the bond
strength, the bonds get 

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.100
stronger as you go to the right.

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:08.400
So that ease of homolysis goes
the other way. 

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.200
But this is exactly what we
talked about a time or two ago 

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.533
when we looked at the energies
of two things and said that 

00:17:15.533 --> 00:17:20.067
homolysis and heterolysis are
opposite one another, whether 

00:17:20.067 --> 00:17:22.933
you take the two electrons or
whether you put them both here 

00:17:22.933 --> 00:17:26.633
in heterolysis, or whether you
put one here and one up there 

00:17:26.633 --> 00:17:28.133
in homolysis. 

00:17:28.133 --> 00:17:31.733
So that's the same thing we
talked about before. 

00:17:31.733 --> 00:17:35.333
So the energy mismatch, the
electronegativity difference 

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:42.800
makes it easier to do
heterolysis, but 

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.933
harder to do homolysis. 

00:17:44.933 --> 00:17:47.100
But notice it's not the same
when you go down 

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:49.300
the periodic table. 

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.367
Now the red and the black arrows
are in 

00:17:51.367 --> 00:17:53.033
the opposite direction. 

00:17:53.033 --> 00:17:57.900
Fluoride is the most
electronegative, but it's the 

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:01.500
weakest acid among the hydrogen
halides. 

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:04.700
And in that case, it is the bond
strength that's making 

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.933
the difference. 

00:18:05.933 --> 00:18:15.067
And that's what made the sulfur
more acidic than oxygen 

00:18:15.067 --> 00:18:18.467
is because of the weaker bond
strength. 

00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:21.767
So that has to do with decrease
of overlap; going 

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:26.567
across had to do with the energy
match. 

00:18:26.567 --> 00:18:28.733
So we understand those things. 

00:18:28.733 --> 00:18:32.400
Now we can learn, by knowing pKa
values, some of the things 

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.733
that influence the energies of
these bonds. 

00:18:36.733 --> 00:18:40.800
So here's an O-H bond in acetic
acid. 

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.600
Of course, it's called acetic
acid-- 

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.600
water is not called aqueic acid
or something like that. 

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.167
So this is much more acidic-- 

00:18:48.167 --> 00:18:50.367
4.8 versus 15.7. 

00:18:50.367 --> 00:18:53.567
So it's 11 powers of 10 stronger
as an acid. 

00:18:53.567 --> 00:18:54.467
Why? 

00:18:54.467 --> 00:18:57.433
Is it because the bond is
intrinsically stronger? 

00:18:57.433 --> 00:18:59.433
They're both O-H sigma bonds. 

00:18:59.433 --> 00:19:01.667
The bonds are essentially the
same. 

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:03.900
But the anions are different-- 

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.267
and we've talked about this
before. 

00:19:07.267 --> 00:19:09.500
What is it that makes the anion
that you're going to 

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.267
make here unusually stable
compared to H-O? 

00:19:12.267 --> 00:19:13.267
STUDENT: Resonance. 

00:19:13.267 --> 00:19:14.800
PROFESSOR: Right, there's going
to be resonance that'll 

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.733
make it stable. 

00:19:16.733 --> 00:19:19.833
Or HOMO-LUMO mixing, if we
wanted not to use the language 

00:19:19.833 --> 00:19:21.733
of resonance. 

00:19:21.733 --> 00:19:26.400
So the low LUMO of pi*
stabilizes the electrons we're 

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.033
putting on oxygen. 

00:19:29.033 --> 00:19:33.833
Now if you make chloroacetic
acid, then it's another 2 

00:19:33.833 --> 00:19:36.100
powers of 10 stronger. 

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.833
Why would that be sensible? 

00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:39.233
Anybody got an idea about that?

00:19:39.233 --> 00:19:39.400
Ellen? 

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.533
STUDENT: Electron induction by
the chlorine. 

00:19:41.533 --> 00:19:42.300
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.467
It's an inductive effect. 

00:19:43.467 --> 00:19:46.900
The chlorine is electronegative,
it withdraws 

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.067
electrons from this carbon,
which withdraws electrons from 

00:19:50.067 --> 00:19:52.867
that carbon, which withdraws
electrons from that oxygen, 

00:19:52.867 --> 00:19:56.333
and makes that a better place to
put a negative charge. 

00:19:56.333 --> 00:19:58.167
So it's worth the factor of 100.

00:19:58.167 --> 00:20:00.100
So we have some measure here. 

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:04.233
Because these equilibrium
constants are easy to measure 

00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:09.267
for reversible acid
dissociation, it gives us a 

00:20:09.267 --> 00:20:12.267
scale that's easily accessible
of how important something 

00:20:12.267 --> 00:20:14.967
like inductive effect can be. 

00:20:14.967 --> 00:20:16.567
Or if we look at this one where
we're 

00:20:16.567 --> 00:20:18.667
breaking a C-H bond. 

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:24.700
Now normal carbon-hydrogen bonds
aren't acidic, but this 

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.300
one is rather acidic. 

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:29.233
It's as acidic as the ammonium
ion. 

00:20:29.233 --> 00:20:30.467
Why? 

00:20:30.467 --> 00:20:35.900
Because there are two pi* vacant
orbitals next door that 

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:39.367
can stabilize the high HOMO when
you make carbon minus by 

00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:40.500
losing that one. 

00:20:40.500 --> 00:20:43.267
So again, we have a quantitative
measure of how 

00:20:43.267 --> 00:20:45.833
important this might be. 

00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:50.200
Now here's an amino acid,
alanine, in the form that's 

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.233
protonated here on nitrogen, and
its pKa, it's even a 

00:20:54.233 --> 00:20:57.367
little bit stronger acid than
the chloroacetic acid. 

00:20:57.367 --> 00:21:00.833
Why would you say so? 

00:21:00.833 --> 00:21:02.067
Nitrogen is not more 

00:21:02.067 --> 00:21:03.700
electronegative than chlorine--

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:07.567
not withdrawing more electrons
than chlorine is. 

00:21:07.567 --> 00:21:08.833
Or is it? 

00:21:12.333 --> 00:21:12.800
Lauren? 

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:14.233
STUDENT: It's got the positive
charge. 

00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:15.633
PROFESSOR: Ah, the positive
charge. 

00:21:15.633 --> 00:21:18.600
That makes it very
electronegative. 

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.367
Let's look at that one in a
little more detail. 

00:21:21.367 --> 00:21:24.967
And it also shows how you
determine these pKa's. 

00:21:24.967 --> 00:21:26.467
So you can titrate alanine. 

00:21:26.467 --> 00:21:32.300
You start with this protonated
form in acidic medium at pH 0, 

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:36.167
say, and it's got that red
proton that could be lost. And 

00:21:36.167 --> 00:21:40.467
then we're going to start
running in hydroxide until 

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.567
we've put in two equivalents of
hydroxide. 

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.100
When we add the first
equivalent, we'll take off 

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.267
that red proton. 

00:21:52.267 --> 00:21:55.567
And then we'll take the one off
the nitrogen when we add a 

00:21:55.567 --> 00:21:56.767
second equivalent. 

00:21:56.767 --> 00:22:02.733
But let's look at how the pH
changes as we add the base and 

00:22:02.733 --> 00:22:05.467
pull off protons. 

00:22:05.467 --> 00:22:06.800
So it looks like this. 

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.200
It changes very slowly in there
and 

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.200
is said to be buffered. 

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:13.033
And then it changes rapidly
again. 

00:22:13.033 --> 00:22:14.000
Now why is that? 

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.500
Why isn't it just a straight
line as you add more and more 

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.100
hydroxide and watch the pH
change? 

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:28.000
If you want to change the ratio
by 9-fold, you could 

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.333
change it from 3:1 to 1:3. 

00:22:33.333 --> 00:22:35.833
So that's a 9-fold change in the
ratio. 

00:22:35.833 --> 00:22:40.767
And remember, the ratio is
measuring the change in pH. 

00:22:40.767 --> 00:22:44.800
So if you change the ratio by 9,
say, approximately 10, the 

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.567
log of 10 is 1, so it would
change the pH of 

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.067
the solution by 1. 

00:22:50.067 --> 00:22:55.233
So adding half an equivalent of
base, going from here to 

00:22:55.233 --> 00:23:02.100
here, changes it by about 1 pKa
unit, 2 to 3. 

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.167
Now suppose we want to change
the pH from 3 to 4, how much 

00:23:06.167 --> 00:23:08.333
do we have to add? 

00:23:08.333 --> 00:23:11.733
If we change the ratio by a
factor of 9-- again, I use 9 

00:23:11.733 --> 00:23:15.633
just because it's convenient, 3
to 1 to 1 to 3. 

00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:18.833
If we want to change it by a
factor of 9 again and go up by 

00:23:18.833 --> 00:23:25.233
another pKa unit, pH unit,
logarithmic unit, then we only 

00:23:25.233 --> 00:23:31.100
have to go from 1 to 3 to 3 to
100. 

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:34.567
That's another factor of 9
change. 

00:23:34.567 --> 00:23:40.067
But it only takes 0.22
equivalents to do that. 

00:23:40.067 --> 00:23:44.267
Then if we want to change it by
another log unit, it takes 

00:23:44.267 --> 00:23:47.033
only 0.03 equivalents. 

00:23:47.033 --> 00:23:50.933
So during this region when the
ratio is some place close to 

00:23:50.933 --> 00:23:55.167
50:50, it takes a lot of
conversion in order to change 

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.933
the ratio very much. 

00:23:56.933 --> 00:24:00.167
But when you're out at the end
and you only have 1% or a 

00:24:00.167 --> 00:24:02.467
couple percent of something,
then it doesn't take much 

00:24:02.467 --> 00:24:06.100
change to change the ratio
enormously. 

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.500
So that's why you get this
behavior as a buffer, where if 

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:12.667
you put a lot of that stuff in,
and you have roughly 50:50 of 

00:24:12.667 --> 00:24:16.733
the ionized and unionized form,
you can do a lot of 

00:24:16.733 --> 00:24:19.567
adding acid or base and it
doesn't change the pH 

00:24:19.567 --> 00:24:20.567
significantly. 

00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:22.800
But if you're out in this region
where you only have a 

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.467
few percent of one or the other,
then it changes 

00:24:25.467 --> 00:24:27.000
drastically. 

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.933
Now if we keep going, we take
off this proton, and again 

00:24:30.933 --> 00:24:34.733
it's slow and buffered and then
it goes up again. 

00:24:34.733 --> 00:24:43.700
Now, how can you find the pKa of
the compound, having done 

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.533
one of these titrations where
you run in and measure the pH 

00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:50.633
as you're going along? 

00:24:50.633 --> 00:24:56.533
Remember, the pKa is the same as
the pH when what? 

00:24:56.533 --> 00:25:00.333
When the ratio is 50:50. 

00:25:00.333 --> 00:25:04.133
So that means if we take it
where the ratio is 50:50, 

00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:06.967
that's the first pKa, the pKa
for this 

00:25:06.967 --> 00:25:10.100
proton, the red one here. 

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:14.067
So the pK1 is 2.35. 

00:25:14.067 --> 00:25:19.167
Now it's reasonable that the
proximity of the positive 

00:25:19.167 --> 00:25:23.133
charge to the carboxyl group
that's going to be losing a 

00:25:23.133 --> 00:25:26.200
proton, having the plus charge
here-- what Lauren 

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.733
was telling us about-- 

00:25:27.733 --> 00:25:32.767
is going to make it, here it is,
300 times easier to remove 

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:37.733
the H+ from this cation rather
than acetic acid, which was 

00:25:37.733 --> 00:25:39.600
4.5 in its pKa. 

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.500
So we went from 4.5 to about
2.5. 

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:44.567
Well, a little bit more than
2.5. 

00:25:44.567 --> 00:25:47.733
We went 300 times better because
of that positive 

00:25:47.733 --> 00:25:52.433
charge, stabilizing the anion
we're going to get here by 

00:25:52.433 --> 00:25:54.867
having these two charges near
one another. 

00:25:54.867 --> 00:25:57.700
So that's reasonable. 

00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.300
Now we take off the second
proton, and we find that 

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:04.267
that's pKa 9.87. 

00:26:04.267 --> 00:26:08.200
Now how would you expect that to
compare with taking a 

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.133
proton away from a normal amine?

00:26:12.133 --> 00:26:15.833
Here we're taking the proton
away from an ammonium ion to 

00:26:15.833 --> 00:26:19.367
generate an amine, but now we
have a negative charge that's 

00:26:19.367 --> 00:26:24.367
making this more stable, be
harder to pull away. 

00:26:24.367 --> 00:26:27.367
So at first glance you'd say it
would be at about the same. 

00:26:27.367 --> 00:26:33.833
If this was easier by a factor
of 300 because this is so 

00:26:33.833 --> 00:26:38.500
stable, then this one, taking
that second proton off, should 

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:44.533
be harder than 300 compared to a
normal amine because this 

00:26:44.533 --> 00:26:47.333
thing is so stable. 

00:26:47.333 --> 00:26:50.367
So with a proximity to the
negative charge should make it 

00:26:50.367 --> 00:26:53.400
about 300 times harder to remove
proton from this 

00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.733
so-called zwitterion-- 

00:26:54.733 --> 00:26:57.667
the thing that has both positive
and negative charge-- 

00:26:57.667 --> 00:27:01.533
than from a normal amine, like
say ethylamine. 

00:27:01.533 --> 00:27:05.400
Now ethylamine is pKa 10.6. 

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.300
It's actually 5 times easier to
take the 

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:13.733
proton away from alanine. 

00:27:13.733 --> 00:27:16.900
From the zwitterion of alanine
it's easier to take it away. 

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.400
The same way this one was easier
as compared to a normal 

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.967
ammonium ion. 

00:27:21.967 --> 00:27:23.600
That seems absolutely backwards-

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.267
that it should be 300 times
easier. 

00:27:25.267 --> 00:27:27.000
Why? 

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.733
Why is it easier rather than
harder to take it away from 

00:27:32.733 --> 00:27:36.700
here rather than here? 

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:41.100
So you'll notice that it's a
question of compared to what. 

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:46.367
Is this a good model for this
when it has a proton on it and 

00:27:46.367 --> 00:27:48.733
isn't charged? 

00:27:48.733 --> 00:27:51.900
Not really, because this has
this carbon with a bunch of 

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.733
oxygens in it. 

00:27:53.733 --> 00:27:57.400
And this one, the ethylamine
doesn't. 

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.333
So maybe the electron
withdrawing effect of those 

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:08.167
oxygens is making it easier to
give up a proton here, 

00:28:08.167 --> 00:28:09.933
stabilizing the anion. 

00:28:09.933 --> 00:28:12.000
The same way chlorine did. 

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.533
Remember, in chloroacetic acid,
it was withdrawing 

00:28:14.533 --> 00:28:16.500
electrons and making it easier.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:22.900
So maybe we should compare this,
not with ethylamine, but 

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.700
with something that has the
oxygens but 

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.833
doesn't have the charge. 

00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:33.300
So we can do that by making it
an ester instead of an acid so 

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:34.967
it doesn't have the charge on
it. 

00:28:34.967 --> 00:28:38.300
Its pKa is 7.3. 

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.200
So now, in fact, it is harder to
take it away, and it's 

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.967
about 400 times, about what we
expected if we have the right 

00:28:46.967 --> 00:28:49.100
comparison. 

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:53.933
So having these charges changes
the pKa in a 

00:28:53.933 --> 00:28:56.500
reasonable way. 

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.267
So apparently the CO2 group,
lacking charge, is 

00:29:00.267 --> 00:29:03.167
sufficiently electron
withdrawing to destabilize 

00:29:03.167 --> 00:29:06.900
that cation more than the
negative charge stabilizes it. 

00:29:09.567 --> 00:29:13.300
Now notice here we've changed
the scale-- now we're going 

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.567
from 10 to 50. 

00:29:14.567 --> 00:29:19.600
We're going to very, very weak
acids. 

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:23.133
And, of course, we can't do that
in water because water 

00:29:23.133 --> 00:29:30.367
has a pKa of 16, and if we try
to get more basic than that we 

00:29:30.367 --> 00:29:33.467
just convert water into
hydroxide-- 

00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:36.000
it's not water anymore. 

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.633
So we're going to have to use
other solvents to do that. 

00:29:39.633 --> 00:29:42.667
But if we use these other
solvents, and again, use 

00:29:42.667 --> 00:29:51.133
indicators with boot straps to
go on up. Then we get that a 

00:29:51.133 --> 00:29:52.900
hydrogen attached to nitrogen. 

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.900
Now we're not talking about an
ammonium ion. 

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.967
That's what we were just talking
about, taking a proton 

00:29:57.967 --> 00:30:01.267
away from RNH3+. 

00:30:01.267 --> 00:30:02.667
It's not that anymore. 

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:04.800
it's taking the hydrogen right
away from 

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.100
nitrogen without the charge. 

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.833
So it's much harder to take it
away than it is to take it 

00:30:09.833 --> 00:30:16.900
away from water, which is what
you expect because the energy 

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:20.533
match was better here. 

00:30:20.533 --> 00:30:26.133
And if we go to carbon then it's
way, way up there, 52. 

00:30:26.133 --> 00:30:28.700
Now in your various books you'll
have 

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.100
different values of that. 

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:34.800
It might vary by as much as 3 or
even 4 pKa units, because 

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.600
you have to go from one solvent
to another here and 

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.333
use these indicators to know
what the 

00:30:40.333 --> 00:30:43.367
equivalent of pH would be. 

00:30:43.367 --> 00:30:46.967
And it depends on which ones you
use to do that. 

00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:49.967
But anyhow, it's way up there. 

00:30:49.967 --> 00:30:53.367
So these values are approximate
because the 

00:30:53.367 --> 00:30:56.333
equilibrium for bases stronger
than hydroxide can't be 

00:30:56.333 --> 00:30:59.567
measured in water-- you have to
bootstrap by comparing 

00:30:59.567 --> 00:31:03.767
these acid base pairs in other
solvents. 

00:31:03.767 --> 00:31:07.200
So that one's a bad E match for
O-H, a better E match for 

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.533
N-H, and a great E match for
C-H, so it's holding the bonds 

00:31:11.533 --> 00:31:16.433
stronger together and making it
harder to form the anions. 

00:31:16.433 --> 00:31:18.900
Now here's another C-H bond, but
it's 

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.233
significantly more acidic. 

00:31:24.133 --> 00:31:28.400
The hydrogen attached to a
double bonded carbon. 

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:34.267
Anybody got any ideas why that
would be easier to break? 

00:31:34.267 --> 00:31:37.067
Can anybody think of an idea why
it might be harder to 

00:31:37.067 --> 00:31:40.633
break a proton away, to break a
bond to hydrogen when it's 

00:31:40.633 --> 00:31:42.600
attached to a double-bonded
carbon? 

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.000
Ellen? 

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:43.867
STUDENT: sp2? 

00:31:43.867 --> 00:31:46.267
PROFESSOR: Ah, it's sp2
hybridized, so the bond's 

00:31:46.267 --> 00:31:48.767
going to be stronger that you're
going to be breaking. 

00:31:48.767 --> 00:31:51.800
But, in fact, it's easier to
ionize it. 

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.067
So it's not because of the bond
strength-- 

00:31:55.067 --> 00:31:56.400
that would go the other
direction. 

00:31:56.400 --> 00:32:00.267
It must be the ion that's
unusually stable. 

00:32:00.267 --> 00:32:05.267
Can anybody think about why the
ion might be stable in 

00:32:05.267 --> 00:32:07.733
this double-bonded carbon, the
unshared pair? 

00:32:07.733 --> 00:32:08.267
Anurag? 

00:32:08.267 --> 00:32:10.900
STUDENT: The pi* of the ion will
stabilize the charge. 

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.133
PROFESSOR: Ah, you could get
resonance. 

00:32:13.133 --> 00:32:18.500
The pi* stabilizes it, but
thanks for biting on that, 

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.033
because it doesn't work. 

00:32:20.033 --> 00:32:21.500
Do you see why? 

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.833
So here's the two hydrogens on
the carbon, double bond here 

00:32:26.833 --> 00:32:27.867
on that carbon. 

00:32:27.867 --> 00:32:31.033
Why is it that when you pull
this proton off and generate a 

00:32:31.033 --> 00:32:34.133
pair of electrons here, why
isn't it 

00:32:34.133 --> 00:32:36.633
stabilized by the pi*? 

00:32:36.633 --> 00:32:37.600
STUDENT: They're orthogonal. 

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:38.833
PROFESSOR: They're orthogonal. 

00:32:38.833 --> 00:32:40.767
So you're not going to get it
that way. 

00:32:40.767 --> 00:32:48.133
But this orbital is sp2, not
sp3, as it is in the other 

00:32:48.133 --> 00:32:49.600
one, the one that's 52. 

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:53.000
So it's a lower energy orbital
for the electrons to be in, so 

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.233
it's a more stable anion. 

00:32:55.233 --> 00:32:56.100
That's good. 

00:32:56.100 --> 00:33:02.867
Now here's an acetylene that
loses its proton, and it's 20 

00:33:02.867 --> 00:33:05.600
powers of 10 better at losing
the proton. 

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.467
Why? 

00:33:06.467 --> 00:33:08.200
Anurag, let's come back to you
on that one. 

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.600
STUDENT: The resonance on the
ion? 

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.767
PROFESSOR: No, it's still not
resonance because-- 

00:33:12.767 --> 00:33:15.400
so here's the carbon, here's the
hydrogen 

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.000
coming out at you. 

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.233
There's a pi ‘orbital that's
this way, and a pi orbital 

00:33:20.233 --> 00:33:24.000
that's this way in the
acetylene, but both of them 

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.100
are orthogonal to that. 

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.400
What's good about it? 

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:29.200
STUDENT: It sp hybridized. 

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.167
PROFESSOR: It's sp hybridized. 

00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:36.533
So here we go from sp3 to sp2 to
sp, and it 

00:33:36.533 --> 00:33:39.467
gets more and more-- 

00:33:39.467 --> 00:33:43.700
so sp3 anion, sp anion-- 

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:47.533
no pi overlap, and an sp2
anion-- 

00:33:47.533 --> 00:33:49.000
no pi overlap. 

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.767
And Anurag, I'm going to do you
one more because you're 

00:33:51.767 --> 00:33:53.300
being so good to me here. 

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.033
So we're going to take it away
from this hydrogen, which is 

00:33:57.033 --> 00:33:59.533
not on the triple bond-- 

00:33:59.533 --> 00:34:02.200
this one the hydrogen was on the
triple bond. 

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.767
Now we're taking it away from a
carbon next 

00:34:04.767 --> 00:34:06.800
to the triple bond. 

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.867
Or here we're taking it away
from a carbon that's on a 

00:34:09.867 --> 00:34:11.200
double bond. 

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.500
But it's also next to a double
bond. 

00:34:18.533 --> 00:34:20.433
Now why do you say it's good? 

00:34:20.433 --> 00:34:21.733
STUDENT: Resonance. 

00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:23.500
PROFESSOR: Resonance-- now you
got it right. 

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.800
Because when it's not one that's
on this, either a 

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.000
double bond or a triple bond,
but it's on the carbon next to 

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.933
it, now it can point this way,
and be like that, and overlap 

00:34:33.933 --> 00:34:34.667
and get the resonance 

00:34:34.667 --> 00:34:36.100
stabilization, so you were
right. 

00:34:38.967 --> 00:34:43.333
So this is a HOMO-pi* overlap
finally. 

00:34:43.333 --> 00:34:44.600
And there we see it. 

00:34:48.033 --> 00:34:52.500
Now there are fabulous tables of
people who have measured 

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.533
these things. 

00:34:53.533 --> 00:34:57.167
So, for example, this is a
website from a course at 

00:34:57.167 --> 00:35:01.667
Harvard, Chem 206, which has six
pages-- 

00:35:01.667 --> 00:35:03.433
this is the first of six pages--

00:35:03.433 --> 00:35:07.800
so all different pKa's of many,
many different compounds 

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.167
losing their protons. 

00:35:10.167 --> 00:35:13.500
There's another compilation at
another website here, which I 

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.700
think is even bigger. 

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:19.733
So these are interesting tables
to look at to see if 

00:35:19.733 --> 00:35:22.367
you can figure out-- look at
molecules that are very 

00:35:22.367 --> 00:35:23.800
similar to one another-- 

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.533
so solvation will be more or
less the same and you don't 

00:35:26.533 --> 00:35:27.933
have to worry about that-- 

00:35:27.933 --> 00:35:30.367
and see what it is about the
change from one 

00:35:30.367 --> 00:35:32.067
molecule to the next. 

00:35:32.067 --> 00:35:35.033
How can you explain in terms
like we've been talking 

00:35:35.033 --> 00:35:38.567
about-- hybridization,
resonance, electronegativity. 

00:35:38.567 --> 00:35:41.933
That is, the HOMOs and LUMOs. 

00:35:41.933 --> 00:35:44.200
How can you explain these trends
seen 

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.000
over similar compounds? 

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.767
So here's the problem for
Wednesday. 

00:35:51.767 --> 00:35:57.000
List the factors that help
determine the pKa for an acid. 

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.700
Then choose a set of several
related acids from one of 

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:05.067
these pKa tables, or your text
will have some, too, I'm sure. 

00:36:05.067 --> 00:36:08.433
And explain what they teach
about the relative importance 

00:36:08.433 --> 00:36:10.367
of these factors-- 

00:36:10.367 --> 00:36:13.500
which is more important,
resonance or hybridization, as 

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:15.400
we were talking about here. 

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.767
So just practice yourself by
choosing a set of three or 

00:36:18.767 --> 00:36:22.867
four, or whatever number seems
to be there, of related 

00:36:22.867 --> 00:36:25.700
compounds where you see
structural changes, and see if 

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:30.567
you can rationalize why they
have the pKa's they have. Then 

00:36:30.567 --> 00:36:33.600
once you've done that in the
privacy of your own room, 

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.633
explain your conclusions to at
least one other class member 

00:36:36.633 --> 00:36:40.033
and decide together how
unambiguous your lesson is. 

00:36:40.033 --> 00:36:43.633
Did you think it through, or was
there something you forgot 

00:36:43.633 --> 00:36:46.000
or did you get something
backwards? 

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.200
So that's your assignment for
Wednesday, and feel free to 

00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.167
consult the problems in
textbook-- they'll have 

00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:56.200
problems about pKa's, and the
references at the end of the 

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.333
tables if you want to. 

00:36:58.333 --> 00:37:03.067
There's a hint that that would
make a good exam question for 

00:37:03.067 --> 00:37:06.900
you to explain something like
that. 

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.300
Now, nucleophilic substitution
and beta-elimination. 

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:14.600
So we've been talking about this
Brønsted acidity in order 

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:17.600
to understand reactivity and
more 

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.367
typical organic reactions. 

00:37:19.367 --> 00:37:22.500
So let's see if we could use
these ideas in understanding 

00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.733
nucleophilic substitution and
beta-elimination. 

00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:29.900
In the Jones textbook that's
chapter seven, but there will 

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.767
be corresponding chapters in all
of the books that you 

00:37:32.767 --> 00:37:37.900
have. We also started talking
about this in lecture 16, as 

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.767
you'll remember, where we talked
about acid base 

00:37:40.767 --> 00:37:44.700
reactions, and about SN2
substitution, and that they 

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.800
really were the same reaction in
terms of the orbitals that 

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.067
were involved. 

00:37:51.233 --> 00:37:56.500
In fact, the beta-elimination or
E2 elimination, remember we 

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.600
talked about at the same time in
lecture 16 where the base 

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:03.367
takes off this proton, you
generate the double bond and 

00:38:03.367 --> 00:38:07.333
lose the leaving group there. 

00:38:07.333 --> 00:38:11.967
Now these reactions weren't
discovered by people who 

00:38:11.967 --> 00:38:19.800
understood mechanisms and
applied them to see what they 

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.500
could make in the laboratory. 

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:24.733
They were discovered by people
fiddling around with things 

00:38:24.733 --> 00:38:26.533
and seeing what would happen. 

00:38:26.533 --> 00:38:30.533
And it's only 100 years or 150
later that people began to 

00:38:30.533 --> 00:38:33.033
really understand what was going
on. 

00:38:33.033 --> 00:38:36.967
So, for example, Alexander
William Williamson in Britain 

00:38:36.967 --> 00:38:40.667
in 1852 discovered that treating
this alkoxide with 

00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:44.600
ethyl bromide could do a double
displacement reaction 

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.400
where you exchange partners and
the ethyl goes on the 

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:51.233
oxygen and the sodium goes with
the bromide. 

00:38:51.233 --> 00:38:57.733
Finkelstein, who was a chemist
in the Netherlands in 1910, 

00:38:57.733 --> 00:39:02.133
found that sodium iodide
reacting with R-Cl could give 

00:39:02.133 --> 00:39:06.667
R-I, so you could exchange
iodine in place of chlorine 

00:39:06.667 --> 00:39:08.467
and get sodium chloride. 

00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:11.367
Now all these things have their
own little bit of lore 

00:39:11.367 --> 00:39:12.233
about them. 

00:39:12.233 --> 00:39:16.533
The reason that reaction works
so well is that sodium iodide 

00:39:16.533 --> 00:39:20.467
is soluble in acetone, the
solvent that's used. 

00:39:20.467 --> 00:39:24.633
But sodium chloride is not
soluble in acetone. 

00:39:24.633 --> 00:39:27.567
So when you mix the two, you
could imagine either of them 

00:39:27.567 --> 00:39:29.267
replacing the other one. 

00:39:29.267 --> 00:39:32.067
But the equilibrium is driven
toward the products by the 

00:39:32.067 --> 00:39:34.367
fact that sodium chloride
precipitates. 

00:39:34.367 --> 00:39:37.600
So all of these reactions have
their own twists about them 

00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:42.200
that make them interesting and
variable. 

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.500
But there's generality, too. 

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:48.667
For example, he could also do
this trick with an alkyl 

00:39:48.667 --> 00:39:52.133
bromide instead of alkyl iodide.

00:39:52.133 --> 00:39:56.300
So if you could only do
something in one particular 

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.767
case, no one cares very much
about it. 

00:39:58.767 --> 00:40:01.900
But if it's general, then people
can apply it to their 

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.900
own problems and it becomes much
more interesting. 

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.867
So generalization is the name of
the game here. 

00:40:08.867 --> 00:40:11.533
And both of those reactions, the
Williamson ether 

00:40:11.533 --> 00:40:14.933
synthesis, and the two flavors
of the Finkelstein reaction, 

00:40:14.933 --> 00:40:17.333
both of them involve exchanging
ions. 

00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:19.700
You start with one pair of ions
and you end with a 

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.767
different pair of ions-- it's
one of these double 

00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:24.633
decomposition reactions. 

00:40:24.633 --> 00:40:31.367
Then in Russia, Menshutkin in
1890 discovered that you could 

00:40:31.367 --> 00:40:32.267
react triethylamine with an

00:40:32.267 --> 00:40:36.200
alkyl iodide and
generate the salt--

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:41.467
tetravalent ammonium salt as an
iodide. 

00:40:41.467 --> 00:40:44.267
Notice that this seems to be
different from the first one, 

00:40:44.267 --> 00:40:47.533
because the first one just
exchanged ions; this one 

00:40:47.533 --> 00:40:50.333
actually creates ions where
there weren't ions in the 

00:40:50.333 --> 00:40:51.833
first place. 

00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:55.300
Or Hans Meerwein working right
after the Second World War in 

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:59.033
Germany discovered that you
could use this thing called 

00:40:59.033 --> 00:41:02.967
Meerwein's reagent, which is a
special kind of oxygen-- 

00:41:02.967 --> 00:41:06.267
oxygen plus because it has three
things attached to it. 

00:41:06.267 --> 00:41:08.833
Trimethyloxonium. 

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:12.167
Fluoroborate is the anion that
he used. 

00:41:12.167 --> 00:41:16.500
This could react with RO- to
give R-O methyl-- 

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:18.467
that is, it's a methylating
agent, it 

00:41:18.467 --> 00:41:21.167
puts methyl onto oxygen. 

00:41:21.167 --> 00:41:24.300
But notice in this one you
actually destroy ions. 

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:27.867
You start with four ions and you
end with two ions. 

00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:31.667
So at the top we have exchange
of ions, then we have creating 

00:41:31.667 --> 00:41:35.900
ions, now we have destroying
ions. 

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:40.600
And then there's solvolysis,
where the reagent actually is 

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:41.300
the solvent-- 

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.433
ethyl can react with the carbon

00:41:45.433 --> 00:41:49.500
displacing bromide as HBr. 

00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:52.900
So that solvolysis means
breaking apart, that's the 

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:55.300
"lysis" by the solvent. 

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.167
So all these seem to be-- 

00:41:57.167 --> 00:42:00.167
if you had a list of reactions
you'd have to memorize, we 

00:42:00.167 --> 00:42:01.533
have all these different
reactions-- 

00:42:01.533 --> 00:42:03.767
the Williamson ether synthesis,
the Finkelstein 

00:42:03.767 --> 00:42:06.767
reaction, the Menshutkin
reaction, the Meerwein 

00:42:06.767 --> 00:42:09.000
reagent, solvolysis reactions
and so on. 

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.167
But the great thing is that
they're all the same. 

00:42:13.167 --> 00:42:15.800
Once you understand the
mechanism, they're all 

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:20.667
nucleophilic substitution, which
is the subject of this 

00:42:20.667 --> 00:42:22.967
part of the course, because all
of them have some 

00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:27.600
unusually high HOMO which reacts
with an unusually low 

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.133
LUMO, which is the sigma*
orbital. 

00:42:30.133 --> 00:42:33.867
So it breaks the sigma* as the
new bond is 

00:42:33.867 --> 00:42:35.133
formed with the HOMO. 

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.733
So if we're talking about the
generality of nucleophilic 

00:42:40.733 --> 00:42:43.833
substitution, we should
generalize over variety and 

00:42:43.833 --> 00:42:46.433
all the different components of
the reaction. 

00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:52.500
Just to give you an example of
how many different kinds of 

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:57.467
nucleophilic substitutions there
are, consider adenine, 

00:42:57.467 --> 00:42:59.633
which has lots of different
unshared 

00:42:59.633 --> 00:43:02.567
pairs on the nitrogen. 

00:43:02.567 --> 00:43:06.667
And ribose, a sugar. 

00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:11.500
Now here you have a HOMO on the
nitrogen and a sigma* 

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.333
LUMO of the carbon-oxygen. 

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.933
And you can substitute the
nitrogen for the oxygen. 

00:43:19.933 --> 00:43:22.867
Actually, as we'll see shortly,
it's not quite the 

00:43:22.867 --> 00:43:25.933
same where you push the O-H out.

00:43:25.933 --> 00:43:28.333
But anyhow that's a substitution
at carbon, which 

00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:31.267
loses water then, and makes that
N-H [correction: N-C] bond. 

00:43:31.267 --> 00:43:33.767
And that stuff is called
adenosine. 

00:43:33.767 --> 00:43:38.600
So the adenine, plus the "-ose"
comes from ribose, so 

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.867
that's adenosine. 

00:43:41.933 --> 00:43:43.500
So we have adenosine. 

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:46.733
And here's methionine, an amino
acid. 

00:43:46.733 --> 00:43:49.467
And it has a HOMO, which is an
unshared pair 

00:43:49.467 --> 00:43:50.900
on the sulfur there. 

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:55.200
And it has an O-H that could be
a leaving group. 

00:43:55.200 --> 00:44:00.567
So you can substitute SR2 for
O-H at carbon and do another 

00:44:00.567 --> 00:44:02.967
nucleophilic substitution, and
you get this thing that's 

00:44:02.967 --> 00:44:06.367
called S-adenosylmethionine. 

00:44:06.367 --> 00:44:11.433
It's methionine that has this
adenosyl on it. 

00:44:11.433 --> 00:44:15.067
And that is this stuff you may
have heard of, SAMe, 

00:44:15.067 --> 00:44:16.667
S-adenosylmethionine-- 

00:44:16.667 --> 00:44:19.533
you can buy it in vitamin
stores. 

00:44:19.533 --> 00:44:22.633
But it's very popular with
nature as well. 

00:44:22.633 --> 00:44:25.367
So if you have an amino acid or
something that has a 

00:44:25.367 --> 00:44:28.900
nitrogen with an unshared pair,
like the nitrogen in 

00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:34.367
arginine, then you can do a
nucleophilic substitution 

00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:39.767
reaction where you substitute
NHR2 for SR2. 

00:44:39.767 --> 00:44:42.600
So it attacks that carbon, the
leaving group leaves, so 

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.967
here's the third nucleophilic
substitution reaction. 

00:44:45.967 --> 00:44:48.933
And it ends up with a methylated
amino acid. 

00:44:48.933 --> 00:44:51.733
Or that arginine could've been
part of a protein and you'd 

00:44:51.733 --> 00:44:55.367
have a methylated protein. 

00:44:55.367 --> 00:44:58.300
Then you could have another one,
where a base comes along 

00:44:58.300 --> 00:44:59.833
and takes the proton away. 

00:44:59.833 --> 00:45:04.567
But that's nothing but a
substitution at hydrogen, and 

00:45:04.567 --> 00:45:06.267
leave the electron pair on
nitrogen. 

00:45:09.333 --> 00:45:12.867
And this is biological
methylation, which I know 

00:45:12.867 --> 00:45:16.733
practically nothing about,
except for the fact that our 

00:45:16.733 --> 00:45:20.233
daughter, who was a student in
this course 20 years ago, is 

00:45:20.233 --> 00:45:23.267
now a professor of biology at
Bowdoin College. 

00:45:23.267 --> 00:45:28.100
She works on biological
methylation, on protein 

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.633
modification by
methyltransferases. 

00:45:30.633 --> 00:45:33.033
I talked to her on the phone the
night before last 

00:45:33.033 --> 00:45:33.900
to check this out. 

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:37.000
She says yes, indeed, this is
the compound that's used in 

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.333
practically all biological
methylation 

00:45:40.333 --> 00:45:42.033
reactions of proteins. 

00:45:42.033 --> 00:45:45.333
So these nucleophilic
substitutions have broad 

00:45:45.333 --> 00:45:47.500
generality and are very
important. 

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:49.867
And what we're going to be
studying then is how the 

00:45:49.867 --> 00:45:53.200
different components influence
the rate of these reactions. 

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:56.967
So we have the nucleophile, the
high HOMO that's coming, 

00:45:56.967 --> 00:45:58.800
we could vary that. 

00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:01.867
We have the substrate, what
various R groups we could 

00:46:01.867 --> 00:46:04.833
have. Included in the substrate
is, of course, 

00:46:04.833 --> 00:46:06.867
whatever's going to be leaving--
the leaving group, 

00:46:06.867 --> 00:46:10.467
we could vary that and see how
it affects the reaction. 

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:13.133
It takes place in some solvent,
that's going to make 

00:46:13.133 --> 00:46:14.033
a difference. 

00:46:14.033 --> 00:46:16.667
And, of course, there's some
product being formed. 

00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:18.567
So all of these things can vary.

00:46:18.567 --> 00:46:24.400
And now, although we looked
schematically early on in the 

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:25.767
middle of the semester-- 

00:46:25.767 --> 00:46:29.567
last semester we looked at this
idea of the HOMO 

00:46:29.567 --> 00:46:32.600
attacking the sigma* and the
leaving group leave. Now 

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.533
we're going to look at the
details of how, as you vary 

00:46:35.533 --> 00:46:39.167
these things, the reaction
becomes more or less easy or 

00:46:39.167 --> 00:46:41.300
takes some completely different
course. 

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:44.867
So that's going to be the
project we begin next lecture.

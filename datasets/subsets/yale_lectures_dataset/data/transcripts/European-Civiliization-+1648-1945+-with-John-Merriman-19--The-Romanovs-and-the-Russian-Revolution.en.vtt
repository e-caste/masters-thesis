00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.184
Prof: Today I want to
talk about the Russian

00:00:05.184 --> 00:00:06.340
Revolution.
 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.440
I want to do just a couple
things at the beginning.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.779
Then I'm going to--I hope you
weren't in Jay's class "The

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:18.340
Age of Total War"
last year,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.370
because I gave almost the same
lecture in it.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:21.890
In fact, I might have done it
this year, too.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.577
As you know,
I have him come in,

00:00:23.577 --> 00:00:25.320
then he has me go into theirs.
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.090
But what I want to do is see
the Revolution through the eyes

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.890
of Nicholas and Alexandra,
for the last part.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.890
But first, just a couple things
at the beginning.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.386
Picking up on something that I
said when we talked about 1848,

00:00:41.386 --> 00:00:45.735
the Russian Revolution is a
perfect way to see revolution as

00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:47.210
process at work.
 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.840
You know, read the chapter.
 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.670
The revolution in February,
as I said before,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.500
people wake up and there are
not a lot of troops around,

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.643
and people are hungry,
and the--and I'll talk more

00:01:02.643 --> 00:01:07.682
about this in a
minute--autocracy falls rather

00:01:07.682 --> 00:01:10.930
quickly and rather easily.
 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.075
It's at that point when you've
got the provisional government

00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:14.810
of Kerensky.
 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.801
It's at that point that,
as in 1848, and as in 1789 and

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:22.349
the following years,
people who want to shape the

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:25.750
future of the country put in
their claims.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.379
That's when social and
political conflicts increase

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:31.769
dramatically.
 

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:35.778
The context of the war is,
of course, mind-boggling,

00:01:35.778 --> 00:01:40.730
with the front not all that far
away from Petrograd--because St.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.739
Petersburg was renamed
Petrograd at the beginning of

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:48.670
the war, because it was a more
Russian name.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.227
Those groups,
like the Mensheviks whom you

00:01:52.227 --> 00:01:55.671
read about,
the Bolsheviks--Lenin comes

00:01:55.671 --> 00:02:00.810
back on the sealed train--the
Kadets, liberals,

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.159
and those people who wanted
czarist restoration,

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.879
and the Socialist
Revolutionaries,

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:09.941
of which Kerensky was one,
who have the most influence in

00:02:09.941 --> 00:02:12.870
Russia of any dissident party by
far.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.265
They would be allies,
especially the leftwing of the

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:19.794
Socialist Revolutionaries,
of the Bolsheviks after the

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:21.860
Bolshevik seizure of power.
 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.470
Then they're dismissed and
persecuted like the others.

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.620
But they all put forward their
claims.

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.926
All the kinds of tensions,
and the "Kornilov

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:38.680
plot," in quotes,
which you can read about,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.222
and the July Days,
and all of that really reflect

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:42.530
the revolutionary process.
 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.240
What happens in October is the
Bolsheviks, after one attempt

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.500
that didn't work,
are able to seize power.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.550
So, Leon Trotsky--who ends up,
as you know,

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.526
with an ice pick planted
through his neck in a garden in

00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:04.407
Mexico City,
assassinated on the orders of

00:03:04.407 --> 00:03:10.860
Stalin--and Lenin and the very
young Stalin,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.840
who was in Siberia at the time
of the February revolution,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.680
the Bolsheviks come to power
and the Soviet Union is created.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.840
Next week I'll talk about
Stalin and Stalinism.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.699
Today it's enough to talk about
the Russian Revolution.

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:42.729
Before I go back and tell you
about Nicholas and Alexandra,

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:48.080
and the crazed Rasputin and
those folks,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.960
nobody expected there would be
a revolution,

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.530
that the Marxist revolution or
version would come to Russia.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.141
Populists, who in the middle
decades of the nineteenth

00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:06.318
century believed that the
Russian peasantry was a

00:04:06.318 --> 00:04:11.240
potentially revolutionary force,
people like Bakunin,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.250
whom I've talked about before.
 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:20.790
They thought that the peasants
would rise up one day and sweep

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.973
away their masters,
to whom they were indentured as

00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:29.569
serfs until 1861.
 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.529
That's not that long before
World War I and all of that.

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:39.923
But for Marx the revolution had
to come where you had a

00:04:39.923 --> 00:04:44.644
class-conscious proletariat that
had been organized by this

00:04:44.644 --> 00:04:48.994
revolutionary elite,
sort of a top-down organized

00:04:48.994 --> 00:04:50.730
revolutionary elite.
 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.091
That would come in Germany,
in Britain, in France,

00:04:56.091 --> 00:05:00.470
eventually maybe in the United
States.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.795
After the Bolshevik revolution,
Lenin is still convinced that

00:05:04.795 --> 00:05:08.040
the revolution is going to come
in Germany.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.250
In fact, the Spartacists do
rise.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.057
They were a real far-left
revolutionary group full of some

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:15.536
very good people,
incidentally,

00:05:15.536 --> 00:05:18.050
like Rosa Luxemburg who ends up
being murdered.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:23.329
She was born in Zamosc,
in what then was Russian

00:05:23.329 --> 00:05:24.339
Poland.
 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.223
The revolution had to come
where you had an industrial

00:05:31.223 --> 00:05:31.829
proletariat.
 

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:33.110
But it doesn't.
 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.759
Or does it?
 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:41.115
I'm a little ambiguous there,
but let me say that because the

00:05:41.115 --> 00:05:47.786
revolution starts in Petrograd,
that the way Petrograd was in

00:05:47.786 --> 00:05:52.779
1917 an administrative,
czarist,

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:56.009
autocratic capital constructed
by Peter the Great.

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:01.470
But it's also a huge,
enormous industrial center with

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:06.300
hundreds of thousands of
industrial workers.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.117
The historians still debate
whether by October,

00:06:11.117 --> 00:06:13.314
that is,
after February during the

00:06:13.314 --> 00:06:16.425
provisional government time,
the Socialist Revolutionaries

00:06:16.425 --> 00:06:19.819
or the Bolsheviks had more
influence in the soviets.

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:22.290
That's where the Soviet Union
comes from.

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.370
In the soviets,
which were organizations of

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.790
workers, sailors,
and soldiers.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:33.899
Marx wasn't all wrong.
 

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:38.425
The role of the industrial
workers in St.

00:06:38.425 --> 00:06:42.839
Petersburg is very important in
this.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.050
Lots of them get betrayed.
 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.500
They all get betrayed,
ultimately, because what was

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.000
going to be the workers'
paradise, it ain't that.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.339
And workers' self-management,
it didn't become that.

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:55.190
It didn't become that at all.
 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.221
They're shocked when the Red
Guards are putting down their

00:06:59.221 --> 00:06:59.930
strikes.
 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:03.358
But in the beginning,
the role of the workers on the

00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:07.730
periphery--remember center and
periphery is terribly important.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:11.350
I talk a little bit about this
in what you're reading.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:16.000
Along the Nevsky Prospect you
have government buildings.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.850
You've got the Singer Sewing
Machine Company.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.500
You've got tramways.
 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.449
I haven't been to St.
 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:26.718
Petersburg since au temps
des camarades,

00:07:26.718 --> 00:07:32.101
since the fall of communism,
but very fancy stores in 1917,

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:36.279
very dolled-up people,
very rich people.

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:41.934
Then the tramway simply stopped
in the mud when they reached the

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:47.050
periphery, when they reached the
working-class suburbs.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.076
The glittering lights of the
big department stores that would

00:07:51.076 --> 00:07:54.230
make you think of London,
and Paris, and Berlin,

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.050
and Vienna, and the big fancy
hotels,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.382
all lit up with doormen
clicking their heels as the

00:08:00.382 --> 00:08:03.750
well-heeled enter and leave,
even during the war.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.574
There weren't any lights,
or very few,

00:08:07.574 --> 00:08:12.329
when you got into the
working-class suburbs.

00:08:12.329 --> 00:08:18.509
The one thing to keep in mind
is that the Russian Revolution,

00:08:18.509 --> 00:08:24.175
both that of February and that
of October, was a popular

00:08:24.175 --> 00:08:25.720
revolution.
 

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.451
This was no sort of a coup
d'état carried out by a

00:08:29.451 --> 00:08:33.048
couple of extremely organized,
determined politicos.

00:08:33.048 --> 00:08:37.490
Lenin was organized and he was
determined.

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:40.100
Lenin was not what the French
would call rigolo.

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.779
He was not a barrel of laughs.
 

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:45.730
He was sure of himself.
 

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.710
He had very little sense of
humor.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:51.169
He had biting sarcasm.
 

00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:54.476
I guess I quote once in there,
when he would argue with

00:08:54.476 --> 00:08:56.134
somebody he said,
"He who does not

00:08:56.134 --> 00:08:57.538
understand that understands
nothing."

00:08:57.538 --> 00:09:00.317
He was very,
very sure of himself,

00:09:00.317 --> 00:09:03.769
a very difficult man to get
along with.

00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:08.609
I'll leave it to you to think
was Stalinism inevitable in

00:09:08.609 --> 00:09:09.559
Leninism?
 

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:10.629
I'm not so sure it was.
 

00:09:10.629 --> 00:09:15.360
Anyway, the revolution was a
popular revolution.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.767
The fall of the autocracy,
the masses did not rise up to

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:21.049
save the czar.
 

00:09:21.049 --> 00:09:24.649
They did not, and the czarina.
 

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:28.740
"Bread,
land, and peace."

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.710
"Bread, land,
and peace" is a very,

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.697
very important slogan when
you've got millions of people

00:09:35.697 --> 00:09:38.889
under arms from all of the
nationalities,

00:09:38.889 --> 00:09:42.210
some of whom didn't know
Russian at all,

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:45.100
many of whom when they go into
the war don't know the

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:47.490
difference between a gun and a
pitchfork.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.360
Until the very end,
Nicholas and Alexandra,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:54.190
who are not very loveable
people-- one can feel sorry for

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:57.129
them, and you will feel sorry
for them.

00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:58.360
They end horribly.
 

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:04.066
But they still had the beliefs
that the Russian people loved

00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:07.118
their czar,
and that they would pour

00:10:07.118 --> 00:10:10.000
forward to save the czar,
and the czarina,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:10.929
and the autocracy.
 

00:10:10.929 --> 00:10:12.710
And they didn't.
 

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:18.270
The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk,
March 1918, pulls Russia out of

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.440
the war and all that.
 

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.039
That's just a couple of things
that the beginning to say.

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:26.490
It's all in the book.
 

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:30.399
Still, it's a very interesting
revolution.

00:10:30.399 --> 00:10:32.855
There's a lot of great
literature on the Russian

00:10:32.855 --> 00:10:34.110
Revolution in English.
 

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.418
I don't read Russian at all,
but in all sorts of languages.

00:10:37.418 --> 00:10:42.139
Now, having just sort of that
set that up--reserved seating,

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:42.620
VIP?
 

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:43.889
What is this?
 

00:10:43.889 --> 00:10:45.940
I don't know.
 

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:55.054
Anyway, there's nobody
there--Let's talk about--did I

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:57.509
do all that?
 

00:10:57.509 --> 00:11:03.009
Yeah--Let's talk about Nicholas
and Alexandra.

00:11:10.409 --> 00:11:12.860
The czar.
 

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.190
Nicholas was a family guy.
 

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:19.299
He enjoyed his family.
 

00:11:19.299 --> 00:11:21.039
They played tennis.
 

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.490
They were modern people.
 

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:23.500
They had bicycles.
 

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.120
They pedaled around.
 

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.505
The bicycle was a relatively
recent invention,

00:11:28.505 --> 00:11:29.558
as you know.
 

00:11:29.558 --> 00:11:35.240
The first big bicycle races in
Europe are already in the 1890s.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:39.720
Like his cousin,
Nicholas II,

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:45.029
he had some general education
in the political economy,

00:11:45.029 --> 00:11:48.799
in math and geography,
and foreign languages,

00:11:48.799 --> 00:11:53.399
which he spoke very well,
and in military science.

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:57.928
But he had very little
intellectual interest at all.

00:11:57.928 --> 00:12:03.447
Built into the way he looked at
the world was this inherent

00:12:03.447 --> 00:12:08.110
suspicion of rationality,
of the Enlightenment.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.450
He was somebody who,
and his wife also,

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:15.500
would still blame,
if he discussed it,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.960
Peter the Great for having
really incorporated,

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.624
in some ways,
rational organization and the

00:12:21.624 --> 00:12:24.260
Enlightenment,
at least the works of the

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:29.860
philosophes,
into Russia long before that.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:34.940
He believed that waging war was
a matter of honor.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:40.258
In that he shared lots with his
wacko cousin,

00:12:40.258 --> 00:12:41.830
Wilhelm II.
 

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:48.025
He was hard-working in the
sense that he read or listened

00:12:48.025 --> 00:12:53.779
to reports on all that was going
on about the war.

00:12:53.779 --> 00:12:58.678
Mark Steinberg has published
some of the letters.

00:12:58.678 --> 00:13:01.970
Mark Steinberg is a friend of
mine who teaches at Illinois.

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:06.934
If I remember correctly,
the czar believed that the

00:13:06.934 --> 00:13:14.308
nobles had compromised the fate
of the autocracy in some ways,

00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:18.500
or threatened it by being
indolent and not working hard

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.200
enough.
 

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:24.485
His view was always that he was
the father of his people,

00:13:24.485 --> 00:13:27.129
that he was the holy czar.
 

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:31.530
Again, everybody has seen
pictures of him sitting on a

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:36.514
horse, blessing the kneeling
soldiers as they're going off to

00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:38.009
fight in 1914.
 

00:13:38.009 --> 00:13:42.980
He constantly referred to his
ancestors, the Romanovs.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.831
"Only the state which
preserves the heritage of the

00:13:45.831 --> 00:13:48.009
past is strong and firm,"
he wrote.

00:13:48.009 --> 00:13:53.450
"We ourselves have sinned
against this and God is

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.940
punishing us with the war."
 

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:02.177
He took command of the Russian
army in 1915 against the advice

00:14:02.177 --> 00:14:03.379
of his wife.
 

00:14:03.379 --> 00:14:08.152
He didn't usually go against
the advice of Alexandra,

00:14:08.152 --> 00:14:13.566
the advice of his ministers,
and the advice of the mad monk,

00:14:13.566 --> 00:14:14.759
Rasputin.
 

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:18.907
Obviously, one of the reasons
that people argued against this

00:14:18.907 --> 00:14:21.879
was (a) he really wasn't a
military guy,

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:27.408
and (b) if it doesn't go well,
will people blame the czar?

00:14:27.408 --> 00:14:31.788
Will the role of the czar be
diminished?

00:14:31.788 --> 00:14:36.928
He had a strong sense of what
he considered moral,

00:14:36.928 --> 00:14:41.649
and it was shaped by his
Orthodox religion.

00:14:41.649 --> 00:14:47.885
His wife, about whom I'll have
more to say, was a convert to

00:14:47.885 --> 00:14:50.000
Russian Orthodoxy.
 

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.235
Like many converts from one
religion to another,

00:14:54.235 --> 00:14:58.110
was absolutely fanatic in her
attachment.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:03.167
He was more relaxed about
religion than his wife was,

00:15:03.167 --> 00:15:08.904
but he often spoke about this
sort of religious ecstasy that

00:15:08.904 --> 00:15:12.308
he felt when he went to church.
 

00:15:12.308 --> 00:15:15.140
Historians now say,
"It's too easy to shape

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:18.634
discourse about the Russian
Revolution around the influence

00:15:18.634 --> 00:15:19.960
of Rasputin."
 

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:23.327
But in fact,
Rasputin in 1914 had warned

00:15:23.327 --> 00:15:27.557
that war would bring God's
punishment upon Russia,

00:15:27.557 --> 00:15:31.788
and great destruction,
and grief without end.

00:15:31.788 --> 00:15:36.429
Rasputin did have great
influence with the family.

00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:41.351
In one letter--again,
Mark put this stuff

00:15:41.351 --> 00:15:45.312
together--the czar wrote,
"When I am worried or

00:15:45.312 --> 00:15:48.121
doubtful or vexed,
I only talk to Gregory for a

00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:51.557
few minutes to feel myself
immediately soothed and

00:15:51.557 --> 00:15:53.100
strengthened."
 

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.543
One of the reasons that
Rasputin had so much influence

00:15:57.543 --> 00:16:01.990
on the royal family was,
of course, tragic illness.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:07.048
Alexi, the son,
was a hemophiliac.

00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:09.783
Hemophiliacs,
I guess now they can treat it

00:16:09.783 --> 00:16:13.491
easier than they could before,
but when hemophiliacs get a

00:16:13.491 --> 00:16:15.250
scratch they can bleed.
 

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.960
The blood does not coagulate
and they can die.

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:24.350
He was not in good health at
all.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:30.139
Rasputin, on a couple of
occasions,

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:34.490
got lucky and predicted the end
of a spell,

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.860
as they used to call them,
or an episode of hemophilia,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:41.610
and everything worked out okay.
 

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:51.966
This increases the belief of
these parents in the power,

00:16:51.966 --> 00:16:57.048
if you will,
of Rasputin.

00:16:57.048 --> 00:17:00.940
When there was a mutiny in the
navy he wrote,

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:02.408
"If you find me so little
troubled,

00:17:02.408 --> 00:17:06.154
it is because I have the firm
and absolute faith that the

00:17:06.154 --> 00:17:08.720
destiny of Russia,
of my own fate,

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.539
and that of my family are in
the hands of Almighty God,

00:17:11.539 --> 00:17:13.390
who has placed me where I am.
 

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.490
Whatever may happen I shall bow
to His will."

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:23.183
This kind of fatalism you would
see to the end,

00:17:23.183 --> 00:17:29.510
when after the revolution he's
on a train and he finally has to

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.940
turn back.
 

00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:35.690
This sort of fatalism was part
of it.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.880
Rasputin by then at that point
was already dead.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.048
He'd been assassinated.
 

00:17:43.048 --> 00:17:45.115
Even the story of his
assassination,

00:17:45.115 --> 00:17:47.420
it was almost impossible to
kill him.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.170
They kept hammering him with
huge rocks and pumping one

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:51.798
bullet after another into him.
 

00:17:51.798 --> 00:17:54.380
The people that wanted to get
him out of the way.

00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:57.154
They finally,
after sort of beating the hell

00:17:57.154 --> 00:18:00.704
out of him and pumping one
bullet after another into all

00:18:00.704 --> 00:18:03.855
parts of his body,
they threw him into a lake

00:18:03.855 --> 00:18:05.519
weighted down with rocks.
 

00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:08.606
When they brought the body up
and did an autopsy,

00:18:08.606 --> 00:18:11.309
they found out that he died of
drowning.

00:18:11.309 --> 00:18:15.455
Anyway,
his influence over the czar in

00:18:15.455 --> 00:18:20.890
a way helped accentuate this
sort of fatalism that was almost

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.460
predetermined,
you could say,

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.190
by his religious orthodoxy.
 

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:30.737
But if you're going to be the
autocratic czar,

00:18:30.737 --> 00:18:34.914
father of all the people,
you don't want any political

00:18:34.914 --> 00:18:38.700
institution that's going to
limit your will.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.906
Now, the Duma, the assembly,
had been created in 1905 after

00:18:43.906 --> 00:18:48.347
the revolution--which I trust
that you have read about--in

00:18:48.347 --> 00:18:50.303
1905,
and the role of the

00:18:50.303 --> 00:18:52.808
Russo-Japanese War facilitating
that.

00:18:52.808 --> 00:18:56.974
He believed that even the
existence of the Duma would

00:18:56.974 --> 00:19:00.019
compromise the virtues of
autocracy.

00:19:00.019 --> 00:19:03.551
As you know,
the Duma loses most of what

00:19:03.551 --> 00:19:06.269
authority it had been given.
 

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:11.289
The Duma seemed to be a
rational organization and this

00:19:11.289 --> 00:19:17.068
didn't fit terribly well in a
worldview that believes in faith

00:19:17.068 --> 00:19:22.029
feeling as opposed to reason,
and has a particular,

00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:26.599
and sometimes peculiar,
idea of morality shaped by the

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:29.548
traditions of Mother Russia.
 

00:19:29.548 --> 00:19:34.628
He and his wife look back to
this sort of imaginary time

00:19:34.628 --> 00:19:39.423
before Peter the Great,
when the true Russia did not

00:19:39.423 --> 00:19:45.259
look westward at all,
and was not tempted by these

00:19:45.259 --> 00:19:47.608
foreign imports.
 

00:19:47.608 --> 00:19:53.411
He idealized that time of
piety, the unity between the

00:19:53.411 --> 00:19:57.788
czar and his people,
the narod.

00:19:57.788 --> 00:20:02.130
In 1902, he wrote a letter to
Alexandra when he was on tour.

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:05.615
He said, "We passed
through large villages where the

00:20:05.615 --> 00:20:08.790
good peasants presented simple
bread and salt,"

00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.220
which are very important in
Russia.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:13.549
At his coronation they spilled
the salt.

00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:15.210
It was part of the ceremony.
 

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:16.990
That was bad omen.
 

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:18.618
He was very superstitious,
by the way.

00:20:18.618 --> 00:20:21.210
Seventeen was his unlucky
number.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.950
He was terrified of seventeen.
 

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:26.356
There was a huge throng at his
inauguration,

00:20:26.356 --> 00:20:30.240
and a stampede,
and lots of people were killed.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.910
That was a bad omen, too.
 

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:34.532
Anyway,
he said, "All the peasants

00:20:34.532 --> 00:20:38.503
presented simple bread and salt
and all went down immediately on

00:20:38.503 --> 00:20:42.160
their knees showing such a
touching childish joy."

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.762
He had the image that the
Russian people were childish,

00:20:46.762 --> 00:20:51.195
that they--and his wife
insisted on this--loved being

00:20:51.195 --> 00:20:52.220
whipped.
 

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.220
They loved being punished.
 

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.630
Since the abolition of the
serfdom in 1861,

00:20:58.630 --> 00:21:03.509
there was lots of mistreatment
of peasants by lords,

00:21:03.509 --> 00:21:09.759
but you could no longer
literally torture serfs,

00:21:09.759 --> 00:21:11.650
so long as he didn't die.
 

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:15.881
Before 1861 if you tortured a
serf and he did die or if you

00:21:15.881 --> 00:21:19.236
just ordered him killed or
killed him yourself,

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.788
you would receive a small fine.
 

00:21:21.788 --> 00:21:28.185
But still, there was this idea
that the narod,

00:21:28.185 --> 00:21:33.230
that the people,
"good, virtuous,

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:36.474
and kindly,"
will come to their senses and

00:21:36.474 --> 00:21:39.579
that they will not disobey
during the war.

00:21:39.579 --> 00:21:41.430
They will do what he told them.
 

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.503
Until the end,
possibly, we don't know

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:49.407
this--the idea that they will
rise up and take him away from

00:21:49.407 --> 00:21:52.400
his captors in those final days.
 

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.318
They did try.
 

00:21:53.318 --> 00:21:56.108
There were attempts,
but it wasn't ordinary people.

00:21:56.108 --> 00:22:02.045
He had these views of
orthodoxy, autocracy,

00:22:02.045 --> 00:22:04.730
aristocracy,
etc.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:05.910
It's a romantic view.
 

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.170
He preferred Russian foods.
 

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:11.119
Peter the Great liked Russian
food,

00:22:11.119 --> 00:22:12.788
but he also,
you'll remember,

00:22:12.788 --> 00:22:14.828
ripped roasts off tables in
London,

00:22:14.828 --> 00:22:20.367
and drank tons of wine and
things like that when he was in

00:22:20.367 --> 00:22:22.019
Western Europe.
 

00:22:22.019 --> 00:22:25.880
He spoke Russian,
obviously, very well,

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:31.770
but he spoke English with his
wife, because English was her

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:35.529
language, along with some
German.

00:22:35.529 --> 00:22:39.708
Again, speaking English was
part of this kind of

00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:44.685
aristocratic tradition of
speaking other languages by the

00:22:44.685 --> 00:22:47.618
aristocracy, but not Russian.
 

00:22:47.618 --> 00:22:50.814
Again, French and German
were--they did speak Russian,

00:22:50.814 --> 00:22:54.308
but French and German were sort
of privileged languages.

00:22:54.308 --> 00:22:59.368
He had this feeling that he
didn't like big cities.

00:22:59.368 --> 00:23:02.722
He had his retreat on the sea
near St.

00:23:02.722 --> 00:23:05.078
Petersburg or Petrograd.
 

00:23:05.078 --> 00:23:06.894
He said that Moscow and St.
 

00:23:06.894 --> 00:23:10.526
Petersburg were "two
needle dots on the map of our

00:23:10.526 --> 00:23:11.670
country."
 

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:15.480
Well, in terms of percentages
he was certainly correct.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.583
It was his idea to rename St.
 

00:23:17.583 --> 00:23:21.500
Petersburg to Petrograd,
because it was more Russian.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.891
But he believed,
and I've already spoken about

00:23:24.891 --> 00:23:29.421
this a little bit,
that the heart of the empire

00:23:29.421 --> 00:23:31.993
was Moscow,
because it was the religious

00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:35.557
capital of the empire,
and that the skyline was dotted

00:23:35.557 --> 00:23:39.420
with churches and not by
government buildings.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:44.827
Part of having a modern army
and a modern navy was you had to

00:23:44.827 --> 00:23:46.720
have a bureaucracy.
 

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:53.090
Petrograd was a bureaucratized
city and "not truly Russian

00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:57.098
in its heart and in its
spirit."

00:23:57.098 --> 00:24:01.167
He didn't spend much time in
the famous winter palace,

00:24:01.167 --> 00:24:04.700
that of the siege in the
Russian Revolution.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:14.690
When he went to his provincial
resort on the sea,

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.440
where I've been,
but a long time ago,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.701
he had a new church built there
but in the original Moscow

00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:22.440
style.
 

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:31.278
Nicholas and Alexandra were
raving anti-Semites.

00:24:31.278 --> 00:24:34.638
That's why it's amazing,
this business--didn't they

00:24:34.638 --> 00:24:37.259
canonize him as a saint or
something?

00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:40.170
I really don't know,
but that's horrific.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:45.265
He loved the Black Hundreds who
had sparked--and in the pogroms,

00:24:45.265 --> 00:24:50.358
particularly in Crimea in 1905,
and had beaten Jews to death.

00:24:50.358 --> 00:24:55.529
He thought that they
represented the true heart of

00:24:55.529 --> 00:24:56.480
Russia.
 

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:00.921
His interpretation was that the
pogroms were the "pious

00:25:00.921 --> 00:25:01.900
rage."
 

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:05.549
I think that's Mark's phrase,
not his.

00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:09.058
Here's his,
unfortunately I quote,

00:25:09.058 --> 00:25:14.618
"The Poles and the
Yids," that is a slang,

00:25:14.618 --> 00:25:18.586
horrible, racist,
ethnic denunciation of people

00:25:18.586 --> 00:25:21.929
who happen to be Jewish,
"who had agitated and

00:25:21.929 --> 00:25:24.940
brought about the concessions of
1905."

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:29.969
That the revolution of 1905 and
until he went to his grave,

00:25:29.969 --> 00:25:33.438
so to speak,
he believed that the Russian

00:25:33.438 --> 00:25:36.558
Revolution was the work of Jews.
 

00:25:36.558 --> 00:25:39.346
Incidentally,
because a fair number of the

00:25:39.346 --> 00:25:43.480
Bolsheviks happen to be Jewish,
this played into the Russian

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:47.384
Civil War because of the sheer
brutality in the Russian Civil

00:25:47.384 --> 00:25:50.376
War of the "white
forces" against the

00:25:50.376 --> 00:25:53.109
"reds,"
or the Bolsheviks,

00:25:53.109 --> 00:26:00.463
was often part of,
just sort of an extension of

00:26:00.463 --> 00:26:03.578
anti-Semitism run wild.
 

00:26:03.578 --> 00:26:08.920
Anyway, Nicholas wrote that the
deaths of these people,

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:12.578
of the Jews in 1905,
was justified.

00:26:12.578 --> 00:26:15.609
"Harm befell not only the
Yids, but also Russian

00:26:15.609 --> 00:26:18.348
agitators, engineers,
lawyers, and all other bad

00:26:18.348 --> 00:26:19.339
people."
 

00:26:19.339 --> 00:26:25.038
Anyway, it's very sad.
 

00:26:25.038 --> 00:26:33.670
There was lots of complexity
built into his being.

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:36.849
On one hand he's supposed to be
the czar of all the people.

00:26:36.849 --> 00:26:38.160
He's supposed to be ruthless.
 

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.910
He's supposed to be tough,
hard, etc., etc.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:47.000
On the other hand,
he's dominated by his wife.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:52.478
His wife is constantly urging
him in her letters to him to be

00:26:52.478 --> 00:26:55.430
harsh,
demonstrate "the power of

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:58.200
your will and your
decisiveness."

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.103
"Show you're the complete
autocrat, without whom Russia

00:27:03.103 --> 00:27:04.348
cannot exist.
 

00:27:04.348 --> 00:27:07.440
Ah, my love,
when at last will you thump

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:11.877
with your hand upon the table
and scream at those who act

00:27:11.877 --> 00:27:12.828
wrongly.
 

00:27:12.828 --> 00:27:17.834
They do not fear you enough,
but indeed they must,

00:27:17.834 --> 00:27:19.059
oh my boy.
 

00:27:19.059 --> 00:27:21.920
Make one tremble before you.
 

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:25.519
To love you is not enough.
 

00:27:25.519 --> 00:27:28.058
They must obey you.
 

00:27:28.058 --> 00:27:32.714
Show to all that you are the
master and that your will will

00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:34.160
be obeyed."
 

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:38.704
He signed one letter to his
wife "ever your poor little

00:27:38.704 --> 00:27:43.019
hussy,"--that's an odd
choice of words--"with a

00:27:43.019 --> 00:27:44.559
tiny will."
 

00:27:44.559 --> 00:27:46.970
With a tiny will.
 

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:52.279
She was born in Germany,
a princess.

00:27:52.279 --> 00:27:55.078
These royals,
as I've stressed,

00:27:55.078 --> 00:27:57.598
they're all intermarried.
 

00:27:57.598 --> 00:28:01.778
She's the granddaughter of
Queen Victoria of England.

00:28:01.778 --> 00:28:05.711
She had identity with
Hesse-Darmstadt,

00:28:05.711 --> 00:28:10.390
the part of Germany in which
she was born.

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.480
And, as I said,
although she spoke English at

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.314
home and with her children,
she had been a convert to

00:28:19.314 --> 00:28:21.358
Russian Orthodoxy.
 

00:28:21.358 --> 00:28:25.920
She also feared or resented
idleness.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.910
She thought it was important to
work.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:30.598
She was a nurse for her
children.

00:28:30.598 --> 00:28:32.529
She worked for her son,
above all.

00:28:32.529 --> 00:28:34.180
She worked very, very hard.
 

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.719
She wanted to keep her
daughters "from foolish

00:28:37.719 --> 00:28:42.319
gossip" and away from being
"idle and listless."

00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:46.019
She was fanatically religious.
 

00:28:46.019 --> 00:28:50.436
She went to church everyday,
and she was intolerant of those

00:28:50.436 --> 00:28:52.009
people who did not.
 

00:28:52.009 --> 00:28:55.700
Again, this turns them towards
Rasputin.

00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:58.884
Again, Rasputin did not make,
by being who he was,

00:28:58.884 --> 00:29:00.509
the Russian Revolution.
 

00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:01.630
It's a popular revolution.
 

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:04.410
But still, he's there lurking
in the shadows.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:09.488
She said, "God has given
Rasputin more insight,

00:29:09.488 --> 00:29:14.167
wisdom, and enlightenment than
all of the czar's

00:29:14.167 --> 00:29:16.058
advisors."
 

00:29:16.058 --> 00:29:20.726
At home, she reinforces the
idea that any kind of

00:29:20.726 --> 00:29:24.808
constitutional compromise was
dangerous.

00:29:24.808 --> 00:29:27.273
She believed until the end that
St.

00:29:27.273 --> 00:29:30.173
Petersburg, Petrograd,
was a rotten town,

00:29:30.173 --> 00:29:31.838
not Russian at all.
 

00:29:31.838 --> 00:29:35.212
As for the Black Hundreds,
who had murdered all the Jews,

00:29:35.212 --> 00:29:38.164
they represented "the
healthy, right-thinking

00:29:38.164 --> 00:29:39.308
Russians."
 

00:29:39.308 --> 00:29:41.990
"The Russian people loved
to be whipped,"

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.578
she said.
 

00:29:42.578 --> 00:29:46.380
She believed it was in the
Slavic nature.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.477
They use over and over the word
"childish"

00:29:50.477 --> 00:29:53.450
in describing other Russian
people.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:59.490
The progressive block,
which I sent around on the

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:03.417
website,
she believed that the existence

00:30:03.417 --> 00:30:07.469
of the progressive block,
which wouldn't have been really

00:30:07.469 --> 00:30:09.880
possible had it not been for
World War I.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.113
World War I gives opportunity
to Russian dissidents to get

00:30:14.113 --> 00:30:18.048
together in ways that they
couldn't have otherwise.

00:30:18.048 --> 00:30:22.659
It makes possible the creation
and operation of voluntary

00:30:22.659 --> 00:30:27.597
associations that are bringing
people together to try to send

00:30:27.597 --> 00:30:32.415
food and letters to the front,
to get news from the front that

00:30:32.415 --> 00:30:34.038
are not military secrets.
 

00:30:34.038 --> 00:30:38.402
These inevitably began to
imagine a world without the

00:30:38.402 --> 00:30:38.990
czar.
 

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.645
There were people in 1905 who
could imagine a world without

00:30:42.645 --> 00:30:43.338
the czar.
 

00:30:43.338 --> 00:30:48.343
Again, there are lots of people
who are thinking about the

00:30:48.343 --> 00:30:53.346
post-war world and who imagine
or are beginning plan for a

00:30:53.346 --> 00:30:55.190
reformed czarism.
 

00:30:55.190 --> 00:31:01.978
It's very hard to say how many
people could comprehend the idea

00:31:01.978 --> 00:31:05.920
that Russia would not have a
czar.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.765
Obviously, the Mensheviks,
the Socialist Revolutionaries,

00:31:10.765 --> 00:31:14.140
and the Bolsheviks did feel
that way.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:19.558
All of these dissident groups
want change,

00:31:19.558 --> 00:31:22.859
but only the liberals and
particularly the Kadets,

00:31:22.859 --> 00:31:28.769
whom you can read about,
want the czardom,

00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:31.980
the autocracy to continue.
 

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:34.904
But until the very end,
Nicholas is determined to

00:31:34.904 --> 00:31:38.074
defend the autocracy,
trying to transfer power to his

00:31:38.074 --> 00:31:40.390
brother when the Revolution
comes.

00:31:40.390 --> 00:31:42.940
Mikhail, who would be the
regent for Alexi.

00:31:42.940 --> 00:31:46.180
Then, when told by his son's
physician,

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:51.759
and imagine this,
that his son would not recover,

00:31:51.759 --> 00:31:57.996
he tried to leave the autocracy
in the hands forever of his

00:31:57.996 --> 00:32:00.038
brother, Mikhail.
 

00:32:00.038 --> 00:32:04.848
In fact, he abdicated the next
day.

00:32:04.848 --> 00:32:11.383
He really wrote only,
"All around me is

00:32:11.383 --> 00:32:17.308
treachery, cowards,
and deceit."

00:32:17.308 --> 00:32:19.828
What were they going to do with
him?

00:32:19.828 --> 00:32:24.458
What do you do with the czar of
all the Russians,

00:32:24.458 --> 00:32:27.930
and Alexandra,
and their children?

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:32.584
Predictably enough,
the liberals and the Kadets

00:32:32.584 --> 00:32:35.618
want to have them protected.
 

00:32:35.618 --> 00:32:39.741
The Socialists basically want
him to go on trial,

00:32:39.741 --> 00:32:44.294
that is the Mensheviks,
the Socialist Revolutionaries,

00:32:44.294 --> 00:32:46.269
and the Bolsheviks.
 

00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:48.950
But for a couple days they
don't do anything at all.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:50.390
They've got other things going
on.

00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:52.240
They've got the war.
 

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.240
I won't discuss the attitude of
the Provisional Government to

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:57.402
the war,
and the kinds of pressures from

00:32:57.402 --> 00:32:59.990
the Allies, of course,
for them to keep the war going.

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:04.519
That is handled in the textbook.
 

00:33:04.519 --> 00:33:09.127
There are more demands from the
public and from the soviets,

00:33:09.127 --> 00:33:11.548
in particular,
to arrest him.

00:33:11.548 --> 00:33:15.298
So, the provisional government
wants to protect them.

00:33:15.298 --> 00:33:18.593
They finally order them
confined to the resort,

00:33:18.593 --> 00:33:22.960
which is called Tsarskoe Selo,
but the name doesn't matter.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:25.568
Nicholas himself,
he wants to go to Britain.

00:33:25.568 --> 00:33:30.240
One day he wanted to live out
the rest of his life with his

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.769
family in Crimea.
 

00:33:31.769 --> 00:33:35.015
Does the British government
want the czar of all the Russian

00:33:35.015 --> 00:33:36.609
people to arrive in London?
 

00:33:36.609 --> 00:33:37.910
Not exactly.
 

00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:41.440
It might complicate the war
effort.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.910
Labor will have no part of it
at all.

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:46.210
You're dealing with a coalition
in the war.

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:47.588
You can't have the czar.
 

00:33:47.588 --> 00:33:51.182
You're not going to be coming
in a 747 or something,

00:33:51.182 --> 00:33:55.338
but you can't have him coming
up the river in the Thames.

00:33:55.338 --> 00:33:57.420
How are you going to get him
there in the first place?

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:01.430
That simply is not practical.
 

00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:05.660
The liberals didn't want the
czar there either.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.005
There were constantly rumors
that the czar was going to be

00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:10.119
allowed to leave.
 

00:34:10.119 --> 00:34:13.360
There's lots of protests about
that.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.438
Kerensky says that the
revolution should show its moral

00:34:17.438 --> 00:34:21.670
worth by seeing that no harm
came to the royal family.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:25.322
By the way, just as an aside,
Kerensky lived a very,

00:34:25.322 --> 00:34:26.539
very long life.
 

00:34:26.539 --> 00:34:30.483
At the end of his life,
he taught this course at

00:34:30.483 --> 00:34:32.329
Stanford University.
 

00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:34.829
There's a story that's probably
apocryphal.

00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:40.253
This is in very contentious
times in American politics in

00:34:40.253 --> 00:34:41.900
the late 1960s.
 

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.820
I can vaguely remember those
days.

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.739
A student, not realizing it was
Kerensky,

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:50.911
asked a question saying,
"How could the provisional

00:34:50.911 --> 00:34:54.135
government be so stupid in their
conduct of those

00:34:54.135 --> 00:34:55.480
operations?"
 

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:58.983
And this clueless person had no
idea that this was Kerensky,

00:34:58.983 --> 00:35:02.250
who was an historian and was
trained as an historian.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:03.909
He died shortly thereafter.
 

00:35:03.909 --> 00:35:06.960
But that is really amazing to
think.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:11.313
Of course, Lenin dies in 1924
or 1925, but Kerensky went on

00:35:11.313 --> 00:35:11.989
and on.
 

00:35:11.989 --> 00:35:16.315
So, what they do,
they're in the resort,

00:35:16.315 --> 00:35:19.309
their little mini palace.
 

00:35:19.309 --> 00:35:21.320
They're allowed to take walks.
 

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.141
They could talk on the
telephone, but only in Russian

00:35:24.141 --> 00:35:27.179
and only in the presence of a
guard who spoke Russian.

00:35:27.179 --> 00:35:29.969
They could not speak German and
they could not speak English.

00:35:29.969 --> 00:35:36.114
They separated the family for a
while, fearful of the influence

00:35:36.114 --> 00:35:38.789
of Alexandra on Nicholas.
 

00:35:38.789 --> 00:35:43.027
Again, this is rather like the
attitude that people had toward

00:35:43.027 --> 00:35:45.320
Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI.
 

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:50.208
People thought that the
influence of Marie Antoinette

00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:53.592
was prenant,
was overwhelming,

00:35:53.592 --> 00:35:55.190
on Louis XVI.
 

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.025
Anyway, then they were put back
together and they didn't have

00:35:58.025 --> 00:35:58.639
much to do.
 

00:35:58.639 --> 00:35:59.730
They gardened.
 

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.929
They taught the children,
which they always had done.

00:36:01.929 --> 00:36:02.849
They wrote letters.
 

00:36:02.849 --> 00:36:03.840
They went to church.
 

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:06.184
They complained that the
soldiers were more and more

00:36:06.184 --> 00:36:06.920
disrespectful.
 

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.110
They were noisy.
 

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:14.139
They were slovenly in their
dress, their crushed caps were

00:36:14.139 --> 00:36:17.670
set awry on huge mops of unkempt
hair.

00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:21.452
Their coats were half-buttoned
and their nonchalant manner of

00:36:21.452 --> 00:36:25.300
performing their military duties
was a constant irritation.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:27.500
They mocked them.
 

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.630
They knocked on the door.
 

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:30.949
"Who's there?"
 

00:36:30.949 --> 00:36:34.268
The answer would come,
"The czar of all the

00:36:34.268 --> 00:36:35.469
Russians."
 

00:36:35.469 --> 00:36:39.554
A Latvian guard,
"a mere commoner,"

00:36:39.554 --> 00:36:43.360
outside would be laughing
uproariously.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:47.568
Once the czar was pedaling his
bike and he goes by a guard who

00:36:47.568 --> 00:36:50.603
has a bayonet,
and the guy sticks his bayonet

00:36:50.603 --> 00:36:52.880
into the spokes of the wheel.
 

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.922
The czar of all the Russians
went tumbling down and skinned

00:36:56.922 --> 00:36:57.760
his knees.
 

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.735
But yet there were rumors of
how well they were eating when

00:37:00.735 --> 00:37:02.018
nobody else was eating.
 

00:37:02.018 --> 00:37:06.887
When the July Days mini-attempt
at revolution comes,

00:37:06.887 --> 00:37:12.519
for their own safety Kerensky
says they have to be moved.

00:37:12.519 --> 00:37:17.170
So, they decided on Siberia,
almost inevitably,

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.619
to a town called Tobolsk,
where they would presumably be

00:37:20.619 --> 00:37:23.699
safe and they were moved on
August 1,1917,

00:37:23.699 --> 00:37:26.860
with their windows covered up
for most of the trip.

00:37:26.860 --> 00:37:30.657
Like Lenin, when he comes back,
is brought back by Germany to

00:37:30.657 --> 00:37:33.619
encourage the Russians to get
out of the war,

00:37:33.619 --> 00:37:35.849
he goes on the famous sealed
train,

00:37:35.849 --> 00:37:38.170
so people can't see that it is
Lenin,

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.639
because people knew what he
looked like.

00:37:39.639 --> 00:37:41.880
The same thing,
the czar of all the people is

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.887
not going to be seen by the
masses, because what if they try

00:37:44.887 --> 00:37:47.179
to stop the train and pull them
off that?

00:37:47.179 --> 00:37:52.980
Ironically, they passed by
Rasputin's home village,

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:57.396
and indeed his house,
as a steamboat took them via

00:37:57.396 --> 00:38:01.239
two rivers to this town of
Tobolsk,

00:38:01.239 --> 00:38:02.619
where I have never been.
 

00:38:02.619 --> 00:38:05.239
This frightened them,
especially Nicholas,

00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:07.349
because he is so superstitious.
 

00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:09.920
The salt falling,
the stampede,

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.349
the number seventeen,
and all of this.

00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:17.782
When they're pulled by the
house, on the steamboat,

00:38:17.782 --> 00:38:21.418
of the dead Rasputin,
his trusted advisor,

00:38:21.418 --> 00:38:23.280
it is a bad omen.
 

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.880
So, they could go to church
when they arrived.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.760
They played cards.
 

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.106
They performed plays,
en famille,

00:38:30.106 --> 00:38:31.489
which they did a lot.
 

00:38:31.489 --> 00:38:35.179
But the counterrevolution was a
very real threat.

00:38:35.179 --> 00:38:39.969
The Americans,
and the British,

00:38:39.969 --> 00:38:41.836
and the French,
after the Bolshevik

00:38:41.836 --> 00:38:44.559
revolution--one reason Stalin
was so paranoid,

00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:48.186
he was clinically paranoid,
just a complete dangerous

00:38:48.186 --> 00:38:50.039
crackpot,
but they had a lot to be

00:38:50.039 --> 00:38:51.590
paranoid about,
because the Americans,

00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:54.590
and the British,
and the French kept trying to

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.929
undo the Russian Revolution.
 

00:38:56.929 --> 00:38:59.550
Anyway, they were photographed
and they had ID cards.

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:03.108
Can you imagine the czar and
the czarina having ID cards,

00:39:03.108 --> 00:39:04.760
like your Yale ID cards?
 

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:09.809
They start seeing obscene
graffiti written,

00:39:09.809 --> 00:39:16.905
new guards come that had even
less respect for them than the

00:39:16.905 --> 00:39:18.949
other people.
 

00:39:18.949 --> 00:39:28.085
There were serious attempts to
kidnap them and to get rid of

00:39:28.085 --> 00:39:29.170
them.
 

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:34.972
There was one in which czarists
were supposed to be hidden under

00:39:34.972 --> 00:39:40.130
the altar of the church when
they were in the service.

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:42.065
This, again,
is a throwback to the

00:39:42.065 --> 00:39:42.829
revolution.
 

00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:46.998
It was like in the French
Revolution, where there is a

00:39:46.998 --> 00:39:51.561
massacre that starts at the
Festival of the Federation when

00:39:51.561 --> 00:39:54.630
people are hidden under the
church.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:58.880
So, there are articles in the
newspapers calling for the

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.130
surveillance of Nicholas
"The Bloody Romanov,"

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.300
and calls for him to be put on
trial.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:10.797
The arrival of a certain Vasili
Yakovlev, a name you don't have

00:40:10.797 --> 00:40:14.568
to remember, obviously,
sent by the Central Executive

00:40:14.568 --> 00:40:16.599
Committee of the Soviet.
 

00:40:16.599 --> 00:40:18.786
He was a longtime
revolutionary,

00:40:18.786 --> 00:40:22.806
rumored subsequently to have
been an agent of the Germans,

00:40:22.806 --> 00:40:24.639
which is preposterous.
 

00:40:24.639 --> 00:40:28.981
Lenin was rumored to have been
an agent of the Germans,

00:40:28.981 --> 00:40:32.601
by his enemies,
because of the way he got back

00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:36.139
to Russia after the initial
revolutions.

00:40:36.139 --> 00:40:39.130
He was the son of a peasant.
 

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:43.690
He had that kind of curriculum
vitae that lots of folks,

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:45.679
including Stalin,
had.

00:40:45.679 --> 00:40:53.119
He had participated in armed
holdups to raise money for

00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:58.079
revolution and became a
Bolshevik.

00:40:58.079 --> 00:41:02.730
He transferred the czar and
family to a much smaller place.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.969
The czar and his wife believed,
naively,

00:41:05.969 --> 00:41:12.510
that they were going to be
taken to Moscow because the

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:17.199
provisional
government--originally,

00:41:17.199 --> 00:41:20.503
before the provisional
government is ended--wants

00:41:20.503 --> 00:41:24.768
Nicholas to sign the eventual
peace treaty with the Germans.

00:41:24.768 --> 00:41:30.110
So, this Yakovlev was ordered
to take his "baggage,"

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:33.289
as they called it,
that is the royal family,

00:41:33.289 --> 00:41:38.960
to this small town in the Ural
mountains.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.023
But the Ural mountain
Bolsheviks were harder to

00:41:42.023 --> 00:41:42.690
control.
 

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:45.219
Remember, the Russian
Revolution, both the first one

00:41:45.219 --> 00:41:47.451
and the second,
have been aptly described as a

00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:48.840
revolution by telegraph.
 

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:53.344
The vast reaches of the Russian
Empire are so absolutely

00:41:53.344 --> 00:41:56.949
enormous that in many cases it
was weeks,

00:41:56.949 --> 00:41:59.791
and in a few places months,
before any revolutionary

00:41:59.791 --> 00:42:03.420
commissar arrived to sort of
inform people what's going on.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.434
So,
lots of these Bolsheviks were

00:42:05.434 --> 00:42:07.190
sort of freelancers,
and,

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:10.126
for a party that was extremely
hierarchically controlled from

00:42:10.126 --> 00:42:14.268
the top down,
there was very little control

00:42:14.268 --> 00:42:17.280
over the Ural Bolsheviks.
 

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:21.431
Nicholas had some trepidation
about that, because he wrote

00:42:21.431 --> 00:42:25.364
that "there was a mood that
was rather harsh"

00:42:25.364 --> 00:42:26.530
against him.
 

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:28.179
Conditions were worse.
 

00:42:28.179 --> 00:42:32.048
They used to like to photograph
birds and things like that in

00:42:32.048 --> 00:42:32.630
bushes.
 

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.500
Their equipment was taken away
from them.

00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:36.440
They could no longer control
their own money.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.911
The guards couldn't talk to
them at all, so they could only

00:42:39.911 --> 00:42:41.170
talk to each other.
 

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:47.780
Some of the guards were just
awful to them.

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:50.980
There were plans afoot to put
them on trial,

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:55.268
a kind of show trial,
but there was also this big

00:42:55.268 --> 00:43:00.159
possibility discussed that they
might simply be killed.

00:43:00.159 --> 00:43:05.559
Trotsky asked that they be put
on trial, so that the corruption

00:43:05.559 --> 00:43:09.739
and abuses of the autocracy
could be revealed.

00:43:09.739 --> 00:43:16.251
The context is that there are
large, massive armies being

00:43:16.251 --> 00:43:19.739
organized, the White Armies.
 

00:43:19.739 --> 00:43:24.460
Because foreign intervention
was already underway,

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:29.927
it's conceivable,
one could imagine why there was

00:43:29.927 --> 00:43:35.320
a national current within the
Bolsheviks,

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:38.630
but local in particular,
and that's what would count,

00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.510
that they should be executed.
 

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:48.304
It's possible that a telegram
came from Moscow ordering that

00:43:48.304 --> 00:43:53.440
they be executed,
or simply that it was the Ural

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:59.360
Bolsheviks--;in the Ural
mountain region--acting on their

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.099
own.
 

00:44:00.099 --> 00:44:03.733
Recently, the archives have
been opened up only in the last

00:44:03.733 --> 00:44:06.989
ten or fifteen years,
and the people that have looked

00:44:06.989 --> 00:44:09.119
think that is mostly the case.
 

00:44:09.119 --> 00:44:14.695
In any case,
the order came in July 1918,

00:44:14.695 --> 00:44:18.039
that there be a trial.
 

00:44:18.039 --> 00:44:23.590
If that was not deemed
possible, they should be shot.

00:44:23.590 --> 00:44:29.454
A bloody execution on the night
of, early morning really,

00:44:29.454 --> 00:44:33.119
of July 16-17,
that number again.

00:44:33.119 --> 00:44:37.527
They actually died on the
17^(th) of July 1918 in a

00:44:37.527 --> 00:44:41.668
horrific massacre with machine
guns and pistols,

00:44:41.668 --> 00:44:45.460
a bloodbath in the basement of
a house.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:50.072
Almost immediately there were
stories that Alexandra and her

00:44:50.072 --> 00:44:54.530
daughters had been seen taking a
train away from there.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:45:00.000
Way into the 1980s the Russian
community in Paris tended to

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.150
settle around the Boulevard
Montparnasse,

00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:07.092
where there is still a very
good Russian restaurant that is

00:45:07.092 --> 00:45:07.500
there.
 

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:10.025
There is a particular
café called the Coupole

00:45:10.025 --> 00:45:12.501
on boulevard Montparnasse where
sort of the Russian

00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:14.730
émigré
wealthy people went.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:17.713
There were periodically women
turning up who claimed to be the

00:45:17.713 --> 00:45:19.865
daughter, and then later,
as the time passed,

00:45:19.865 --> 00:45:21.530
the granddaughter of the czar.
 

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:25.679
It was only after what was left
of the bodies,

00:45:25.679 --> 00:45:27.809
or the bones,
them dry bones,

00:45:27.809 --> 00:45:33.202
were discovered in 1976,
and forensic experts in 1991

00:45:33.202 --> 00:45:39.440
were able to work with the DNA,
that the victims have all been

00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.860
accounted for.
 

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:44.030
None of them escaped.
 

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:49.295
The others were in that long
Russian tradition of false czars

00:45:49.295 --> 00:45:53.327
or false czarinas,
the kind their loyalty to whom

00:45:53.327 --> 00:45:57.340
in the eighteenth century
generated so many uprisings.

00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.349
What can one say?
 

00:45:59.349 --> 00:46:02.539
He's been canonized,
this vicious,

00:46:02.539 --> 00:46:08.050
murderous, anti-Semite,
by the Russian Orthodox Church.

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:09.630
But that's not my church.
 

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:10.869
It's not for me to say that.
 

00:46:10.869 --> 00:46:12.380
I don't know.
 

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.380
Yes I do.
 

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.730
Anyway, tragic martyrdom?
 

00:46:15.730 --> 00:46:22.532
Were they heroic people,
or simply human beings who were

00:46:22.532 --> 00:46:29.353
mowed down in a revolution that
didn't start out as a bloody

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:35.340
revolution but became a very,
very bloody civil war?

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.989
Was it the first signposts of
Soviet totalitarianism?

00:46:38.989 --> 00:46:40.659
No.
 

00:46:40.659 --> 00:46:41.869
It wasn't that.
 

00:46:41.869 --> 00:46:46.824
Was it bloody vengeance for
past misdeeds in the pursuit of

00:46:46.824 --> 00:46:47.679
justice?
 

00:46:47.679 --> 00:46:50.469
It depends on your viewpoint.
 

00:46:50.469 --> 00:46:53.260
I happen to believe the latter.
 

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.239
See you on Wednesday.
 

00:46:55.239 --> 00:46:56.239
Thank you.

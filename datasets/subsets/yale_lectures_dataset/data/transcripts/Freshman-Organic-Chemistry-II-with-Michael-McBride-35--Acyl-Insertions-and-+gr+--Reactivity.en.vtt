00:00:01.267 --> 00:00:01.500
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK. 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.300
We were talking about acid
derivatives. 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.500
We started last time talking
about acyl insertions, 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.333
although I'm not sure I
mentioned the term. 

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.600
And then about reactivity at the
position adjacent to 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.833
carbonyles, alpha-reactivity and
condensation reactions, 

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:22.167
which are related to that, which
are chapters 18 and 19 

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:25.600
in the Jones text. 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.933
So acyl insertion is to put an
atom in the bond between the R 

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.633
and the carbonyle group, the
acyl group. 

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:38.367
So you just move the R aside and
put X in there. 

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:41.633
So X can be an oxygen, the 

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:45.000
Baeyer-Villiger reaction of
ketones. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.300
It can be an NH group. 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.900
so you can make an amine from a
ketone. 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.567
It can be a CH2 group inserted
into the carboxylic acid. 

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:03.800
So in the first case, you get a
ketone transformed to an 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.700
ester, in the second case, a
ketone transformed to amide. 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.733
In the third case, it's an acid
goes to an acid, but it's 

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:15.267
an acid that's longer by one
carbon. 

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:18.567
Can you think of any other ways
of having an acid and 

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:21.133
making an acid that's longer by
one carbon? 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.300
It has to be sort of a
roundabout way. 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:34.200
You could go from the acid to
the alcohol, from the alcohol 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.500
to the halide. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.000
Now you've got something you can
make reactive. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.367
It's reactive in itself, the
halide. 

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:43.100
You could displace it with a
carbon nucleophile. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.667
That would add one carbon to the
chain. 

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.600
So it could be CN, right? 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.033
And then we know you can
hydrolyze CN to make 

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:52.633
carboxylic acid. 

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.367
So that would be one unit
longer. 

00:01:55.367 --> 00:02:00.700
Or once you have the alkyl
halide, you could make it into 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.200
a Grignard reagent, or an alkyl
lithium, and add CO2, 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.567
which is a carboxylic acid again
one way. 

00:02:06.567 --> 00:02:08.733
So there are many ways, as we
said last 

00:02:08.733 --> 00:02:10.567
time, to skin the cat. 

00:02:10.567 --> 00:02:13.667
But one way is this
Arndt-Eistert procedure, which 

00:02:13.667 --> 00:02:16.100
gives good yields. 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.133
So we were starting to talk
about the Baeyer-Villiger 

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:21.300
reaction last time. 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:28.633
And I'm going to write some more
on the 

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:29.900
board here with this. 

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:06.433
It's supposed to turn that
projector off. 

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:21.967
I think I'll just turn it off
and we'll use the side ones 

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:27.567
for the rest of the lecture. 

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:27.867
OK. 

00:03:27.867 --> 00:03:30.167
So the Baeyer-Villiger reaction,
as we said, starts 

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:41.700
with a ketone and reacts with a
peroxy acid. 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.267
Which is, of course, an acid. 

00:03:48.267 --> 00:03:52.600
It's got a pKa, I think, about 7
or something like that. 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.433
So we can get the anion here. 

00:04:15.967 --> 00:04:25.500
We could add the acid and make
the analog of a hemiketal, but 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.800
instead... We don't have a
leaving group here that we can 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.067
leave. It looks like the only
leaving group is that. 

00:04:33.067 --> 00:04:36.700
But there's a fancy way to do
it, which is, this can make 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.433
these electrons of high energy.

00:04:39.433 --> 00:04:45.933
So we can use those electrons to
displace the leaving group. 

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:56.467
So now we have COR' OR. 

00:04:56.467 --> 00:05:01.900
So we've inserted that oxygen
between the originally acyl 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.200
carbon and the R group. 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.800
So we have an ester, plus, of
course, the carboxylic acid, 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.167
which was a good leaving group,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.333
the anion of the carboxylic
acid. 

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:24.300
Now, I indicated here that we
had different R groups, or 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.000
could have different R groups, R
and R prime. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.300
The question obviously arises of
which one migrates, which 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.267
ester do you get? 

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:52.767
Now, this is called migratory
aptitude, and it comes in a 

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:54.700
reasonable order. 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:06.500
H tertiary radical, secondary,
primary, and CH3. 

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:12.900
But I didn't tell you whether
this is increasing or 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.600
decreasing in migratory
aptitude. 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.633
So what is the group that
shifts? 

00:06:20.633 --> 00:06:25.100
Is it a cation, a radical, or an
anion? 

00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:34.667
What have I shown with my curved
arrows? 

00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:39.467
When R moves over, does it move
without electrons, with 

00:06:39.467 --> 00:06:43.167
one electron, or with a pair of
electrons? 

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:43.600
STUDENT: A Pair of electrons. 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.033
PROFESSOR: With a pair of
electrons. 

00:06:45.033 --> 00:06:46.900
So it's R minus that moves. 

00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:54.067
It's a methide. Or an alkide,
shift, 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.633
we say, like a methide shift. 

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:11.400
So do you think methyl is the
best or the worst at shifting, 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.367
say, compared with a tertiary? 

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:15.500
Which should be the best? 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.100
Suppose it were a cation that
were shifting. 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.367
Which would be best? 

00:07:19.367 --> 00:07:23.100
What do you think? 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.433
Liang, what do you think? 

00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:26.867
Which is the best cation? 

00:07:26.867 --> 00:07:30.700
Methyl, a primary, a secondary,
a tertiary? 

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.667
STUDENT: Tertiary. 

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:32.467
PROFESSOR: Can't hear very well.

00:07:32.467 --> 00:07:32.800
STUDENT: Tiertiary. 

00:07:33.467 --> 00:07:34.267
PROFESSOR: Yes, tertiary. 

00:07:34.267 --> 00:07:39.700
So, if it's just the opposite
with anions. 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.867
So if it's an anion that's
shifting, 

00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:46.133
then one would predict that
methyl would be the thing that 

00:07:46.133 --> 00:07:50.067
would be easiest to shift, and
tertiary would be the hardest. 

00:07:50.067 --> 00:07:52.833
But in fact, H is better than
this. 

00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:57.233
And this is better, better,
better, right? 

00:07:57.233 --> 00:08:01.133
So it's not the best anion that
shifts. 

00:08:01.133 --> 00:08:05.367
It's the best cation that
shifts. 

00:08:05.367 --> 00:08:06.600
Doesn't that seem curious? 

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:13.800
But the reason is that it
doesn't break completely away 

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.333
to become R minus. 

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:22.833
Its electrons, which have been
boosted in energy by having 

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:26.567
this charge next door, are being
shared 

00:08:26.567 --> 00:08:28.200
with sigma* here. 

00:08:31.433 --> 00:08:35.033
So in fact, those electrons have
to be given to something 

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:38.233
else in order for the
rearrangement to take place. 

00:08:38.233 --> 00:08:41.833
If it were an alkide shift in
which the R pulled away to 

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:46.633
become anion, and then attacked
sigma*, then the 

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:49.100
best anion would do it. 

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.433
But that's not the way it goes.

00:08:50.433 --> 00:08:51.767
In fact, exactly the opposite. 

00:08:51.767 --> 00:08:55.367
Because it actually is giving up
electrons in 

00:08:55.367 --> 00:08:57.167
the process of shifting. 

00:08:57.167 --> 00:09:00.567
These electrons are being given
to sigma*. 

00:09:00.567 --> 00:09:17.600
So it's the best cation migrates
fastest, which seems 

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.300
sort of funny, when you say that
it's an alkide shift. 

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:33.667
One other feature is that if the
group that's migrating is 

00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:46.333
chiral, then, since you're just
moving these electrons 

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:50.067
over, it's not a any kind of
backside attack. 

00:09:50.067 --> 00:09:53.400
So the R in the product will
retain stereochemistry. 

00:10:05.467 --> 00:10:05.800
OK. 

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.367
This is the Baeyer-Villiger
reaction. 

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.367
So that inserts an oxygen. 

00:10:27.367 --> 00:10:31.233
Then we said that the Beckmann
rearrangement-- 

00:10:31.233 --> 00:10:32.500
notice that these are old. 

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.000
Remember, the Baeyer-Villiger
was done at the same time that 

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.067
Gomberg was there, essentially,
1900, roughly. 

00:10:38.067 --> 00:10:40.400
The Beckmann rearrangement is
1886. 

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.700
This was done by one of the few
organic chemists who was 

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.900
also a physical chemist,
Beckmann. 

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.667
He invented a very, very
sensitive thermometer, as 

00:10:49.667 --> 00:10:54.533
well, and worked in the same
department with Ostwald, whom 

00:10:54.533 --> 00:10:56.933
we mentioned before. 

00:10:56.933 --> 00:11:01.433
But the Beckmann rearrangement
puts a nitrogen in. 

00:11:01.433 --> 00:11:08.833
So it starts with a ketone like
cyclohexanone and inserts 

00:11:08.833 --> 00:11:16.733
a nitrogen in the bond between
carbon and oxygen. 

00:11:16.733 --> 00:11:26.300
And the reagent that does it is
hydoxyl amine, and then 

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:28.167
treated with acid. 

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:31.767
So we already talked about what
amines do with ketones. 

00:11:31.767 --> 00:11:33.733
They give imines. 

00:11:33.733 --> 00:11:39.167
And it's especially good to do
for amines, you remember, that 

00:11:39.167 --> 00:11:42.600
have unshared pairs that are
interacting unfavorably. 

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.800
So you lose water and generate
what's called an oxime. 

00:11:58.867 --> 00:12:01.800
Now, the Beckmann rearrangement
happens when 

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.400
this is treated with strong
acid. 

00:12:10.567 --> 00:12:12.600
You could imagine it protonating
the nitrogen. 

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.300
It probably does that. 

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:16.967
But when it does it, it comes
off again. 

00:12:16.967 --> 00:12:19.267
But it can protonate the oxygen,
as well. 

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:28.533
And now we have the leaving
group. 

00:12:31.967 --> 00:12:37.467
But N+ doesn't look like such a
very good cation. 

00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:41.867
So in fact, what you use is the
electrons here. 

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:50.067
These electrons shift up, so
it's very much like the R 

00:12:50.067 --> 00:12:53.633
minus, or R plus, if you wish,
shifting in that case. 

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.433
Pardon me. 

00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:09.333
This is a C. I'll write it
explicitly. 

00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:16.667
And we have the N here, and a
double bond here. 

00:13:22.567 --> 00:13:28.767
And notice that since these
electrons left this carbon, 

00:13:28.767 --> 00:13:30.633
there should be a positive
charge on this 

00:13:30.633 --> 00:13:33.633
carbon in the formula. 

00:13:33.633 --> 00:13:34.833
Right? 

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.867
So since this is done with
water, present, we can put 

00:13:47.867 --> 00:13:49.100
water on there. 

00:13:52.467 --> 00:13:54.833
Well, actually, let me draw a
resonance structure of this 

00:13:54.833 --> 00:14:01.833
first. Notice that it's hard to
pull these electrons away 

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:03.700
to leave this, what would appear
to be a 

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.933
vinyl cation, right? 

00:14:05.933 --> 00:14:08.167
But remember that the nitrogen
has a pair of 

00:14:08.167 --> 00:14:13.100
electrons in its pi system. 

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:13.767
Have I got that right? 

00:14:13.767 --> 00:14:14.367
Yeah. 

00:14:14.367 --> 00:14:16.133
It's got another pair of
electrons. 

00:14:16.133 --> 00:14:19.967
These electron are displacing
this, so they're coming in 

00:14:19.967 --> 00:14:22.033
backside to that orbital. 

00:14:22.033 --> 00:14:25.233
But there's another pair of
electrons on the nitrogen, and 

00:14:25.233 --> 00:14:28.833
at the same time that these
electrons are leaving from 

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:34.867
this carbon, these electrons can
go toward that carbon. 

00:14:34.867 --> 00:14:37.433
And if that happens, we get a
resonance structure of this 

00:14:37.433 --> 00:14:49.667
thing which has the positive
charge on the nitrogen. 

00:14:49.667 --> 00:14:49.967
Right? 

00:14:49.967 --> 00:14:52.333
So it's not as unstable as you
might have thought. 

00:14:55.233 --> 00:15:07.433
But at any rate, when we add
water and lose a proton, we 

00:15:07.433 --> 00:15:12.433
can get this, which is of course
related allylically, if 

00:15:12.433 --> 00:15:19.900
we just shift the proton, to
this amide. 

00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:33.800
So we've indeed inserted NH into
the carbonyl-to-alpha- 

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.267
carbon bond. 

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:38.533
Incidentally, this particular
amine, 

00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:39.967
this particular lactone-- 

00:15:43.833 --> 00:15:46.267
a lactam, pardon me, 

00:15:46.267 --> 00:15:49.733
a lactone is a cyclic ester, 

00:15:49.733 --> 00:15:55.200
a lactam is a cyclic amine, or
amide-- 

00:15:55.200 --> 00:16:02.633
and this particular one is
called caprolactam, and it's 

00:16:02.633 --> 00:16:09.300
of some commercial interest.
Because if you hydrolyze it, 

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:23.467
it becomes this amine, which, of
course, can cyclize, 

00:16:23.467 --> 00:16:26.867
the amine can form an amide with
the COOH. 

00:16:26.867 --> 00:16:33.300
But it can also form polymers
where the amine attacks the 

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.433
carboxylic acid of another
molecule. 

00:16:35.433 --> 00:16:38.667
So instead of a ring, one can
then get a chain, and you can 

00:16:38.667 --> 00:16:40.567
get a very, very long chain. 

00:16:40.567 --> 00:16:42.833
This is called nylon. 

00:16:42.833 --> 00:16:44.767
The polymer-- 

00:16:44.767 --> 00:16:47.633
I'll write it this way-- 

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:48.900
is called nylon-6. 

00:16:53.267 --> 00:16:58.100
So the 6 means that there are
six carbons in the chain 

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:59.767
between the amide groups. 

00:17:08.433 --> 00:17:12.833
Now again, we could wonder, in a
case where we have different 

00:17:12.833 --> 00:17:25.233
Rs here, which are migrates. 

00:17:25.233 --> 00:17:27.700
That is, which one gets next to
the nitrogen. 

00:17:30.633 --> 00:17:33.333
Now, one might think it would be
something like this up 

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:37.067
here, where the best cation
would move, because its 

00:17:37.067 --> 00:17:41.133
electrons trends are being
shared with the sigma*, 

00:17:41.133 --> 00:17:43.500
that's allowing the water to
leave. 

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.600
But it's actually not that. 

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:49.767
Because you'll notice, there are
two different isomers of 

00:17:49.767 --> 00:17:59.933
oximes, and if you're careful,
you can separate them. 

00:17:59.933 --> 00:18:04.800
And it turns out that in this
one, R migrates, but in this 

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.533
one, R prime migrates, 

00:18:07.533 --> 00:18:10.500
which doesn't surprise you,
because 

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:13.300
it's a backside attack. 

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.300
Displacement of the water. 

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:21.500
So it inserts, the nitrogen
inserts, in the antibond, the 

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:28.200
one that's away from the OH. 

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.000
OK. 

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.600
So that's the Beckmann
rearrangement. 

00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:01.967
And then the Arndt-Eistert
reaction, which is the 

00:19:01.967 --> 00:19:07.967
homologation, the one that makes
an acid one unit longer. 

00:19:17.233 --> 00:19:30.800
So you have a carboxylic acid,
and insert CH2 in this bond. 

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:37.567
And the way that one goes is
first, to react with SOCl2. 

00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:39.667
What will that do to the acid? 

00:19:39.667 --> 00:19:41.333
SOCl2, remember that reagent? 

00:19:41.333 --> 00:19:44.067
STUDENT: Switches OH out for Cl.

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:48.367
PROFESSOR: Replaces OH with Cl,
the same as it does in ROH. 

00:19:48.367 --> 00:19:49.633
So we have an acid chloride. 

00:19:54.167 --> 00:19:59.967
And now, nucleophiles can do
association-dissociation and 

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:01.600
displace the chloride. 

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.067
And the particular nucleophile
that's used in this case is 

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:06.300
called diazomethane. 

00:20:13.167 --> 00:20:18.933
It's a very poisonous and
unstable compound. 

00:20:18.933 --> 00:20:23.433
It's a good idea not to work
with it. 

00:20:23.433 --> 00:20:27.067
It's one of these interesting
molecules that you can't draw 

00:20:27.067 --> 00:20:29.933
a Lewis structure without
putting charge in it, which is 

00:20:29.933 --> 00:20:33.833
sort of a tip that it might be
reactive. 

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:37.600
But you can draw not only that
resonance structure, 

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.833
but also this one. 

00:20:45.900 --> 00:20:50.033
The nitrogen in the middle has
to be positive, but the 

00:20:50.033 --> 00:20:53.767
negative charge can be written
on either end of the molecule. 

00:20:53.767 --> 00:20:56.533
It's probably better to put it
on nitrogen than to put it on 

00:20:56.533 --> 00:21:01.467
carbon, but the reactivity is of
the carbon. 

00:21:01.467 --> 00:21:06.967
So these are the electrons that
come up. 

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:12.533
And then loss again, 

00:21:12.533 --> 00:21:15.400
so substitution at the acyl
carbon, as we've 

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.400
been speaking about. 

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:32.800
So now we have CH2N plus triple
bond N. Which loses a 

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:38.133
proton to give ROCHN2-- 

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:48.867
OK. 

00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:50.100
I'll draw it this way. 

00:21:55.467 --> 00:21:56.733
Have I done it right? 

00:22:08.167 --> 00:22:08.433
Yeah. 

00:22:08.433 --> 00:22:09.700
OK, good. 

00:22:11.733 --> 00:22:13.000
Plus minus-- 

00:22:17.733 --> 00:22:19.000
which is called a diazoketone. 

00:22:30.367 --> 00:22:32.233
Now, it doesn't surprise you
that 

00:22:32.233 --> 00:22:33.867
diazoketones, when heated-- 

00:22:38.033 --> 00:22:40.200
and it's often done in the
presence of silver-- 

00:22:42.767 --> 00:22:56.633
lose nitrogen to give an unusual
compound, because 

00:22:56.633 --> 00:23:00.267
there's just two bonds to that
carbon. 

00:23:00.267 --> 00:23:02.333
It's like a carbene. 

00:23:02.333 --> 00:23:09.367
So it has a vacant orbital and
an unshared pair. 

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.567
And now you can see how we're
set up for the rearrangement. 

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.667
These electrons can shift just
as they did in the Beckmann 

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:27.633
rearrangement; just as they did
in the 

00:23:27.633 --> 00:23:29.033
Baeyer-Villiger reaction. 

00:23:34.633 --> 00:23:45.033
But at the same time, these
electrons can come here to 

00:23:45.033 --> 00:23:46.733
make a double bond. 

00:23:46.733 --> 00:23:52.167
So we have O=C=CHR. 

00:23:59.233 --> 00:24:04.900
And notice that this, if we
trace through this carbon 

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:13.600
here, became this carbon, became
this carbon, became 

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.833
this carbon, 

00:24:16.767 --> 00:24:18.000
and it's now this carbon. 

00:24:22.933 --> 00:24:26.967
So we inserted that carbon
between the carbonyl carbon 

00:24:26.967 --> 00:24:30.033
and the R group. 

00:24:30.033 --> 00:24:32.300
Now, we've seen this kind of
compound before. 

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:33.900
It's an acid derivative. 

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:35.167
It's a ketene. 

00:24:41.067 --> 00:24:47.700
So it can add water, as we've
discussed before, to give 

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:55.633
RCHCOOH, which accomplishes what
we wanted to do. 

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.833
CH2 now, because of the H from
the water. 

00:25:04.933 --> 00:25:05.233
OK. 

00:25:05.233 --> 00:25:09.233
So that's the Arndt-Eistert
procedure, which lengthens a 

00:25:09.233 --> 00:25:11.967
carboxylic acid by one unit. 

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:33.533
I want to speak a little bit
about--the rest of the stuff 

00:25:33.533 --> 00:25:36.633
we're going to talk about with
acid derivatives, is reaction 

00:25:36.633 --> 00:25:38.100
at the alpha-position. 

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.567
That is, making an anion at the

00:25:40.567 --> 00:25:42.033
alpha-position and using that. 

00:25:42.033 --> 00:25:43.767
So like an enolate. 

00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:46.300
But first we should look at the

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.000
acidity of these compounds. 

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.667
So I'll just use the slide to
talk about that. 

00:25:52.667 --> 00:25:53.000
OK. 

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.900
So the pKa of acid aldehyde is
17, right? 

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.767
Acetone, we talked about this
before, is 

00:26:00.767 --> 00:26:02.100
slightly less acidic. 

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.700
The anion isn't quite as stable.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:14.233
19, two orders of magnitude in
the equilibrium constant. 

00:26:14.233 --> 00:26:17.600
Now, the ester is another five
orders of 

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.767
magnitude less acidic. 

00:26:19.767 --> 00:26:20.000
Right? 

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.333
The equilibrium constant is 10
to the fifth smaller. 

00:26:23.333 --> 00:26:30.033
Why is it that the ester is less
prone to form the anion 

00:26:30.033 --> 00:26:33.833
by losing that red proton than a
ketone is? 

00:26:37.633 --> 00:26:39.367
I could make the opposite
argument. 

00:26:39.367 --> 00:26:43.200
I could say oxygen is electron e
withdrawing, which would 

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.367
make it easy to form an anion. 

00:26:46.367 --> 00:26:48.867
So there must be something else
that goes in the opposite 

00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:51.300
direction that's even more
important. 

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.533
What is it? 

00:26:55.567 --> 00:26:56.100
Ruoyi? 

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.333
STUDENT: The unshared pair on O.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.467
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:27:02.467 --> 00:27:03.367
That's right. 

00:27:03.367 --> 00:27:08.067
What allows you to form the
anion at this position? 

00:27:08.067 --> 00:27:11.100
In these cases, it's
stabilization by mixing with 

00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.433
the LUMO, pi*. 

00:27:13.433 --> 00:27:16.933
But in this case, the LUMO is
always already being used to 

00:27:16.933 --> 00:27:20.100
stabilize the electrons of the
oxygen. 

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.500
In fact, you could make the same
argument here, in terms 

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:23.667
of hyperconjugation. 

00:27:23.667 --> 00:27:27.100
That the pi* here is being used
to stabilize the 

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.500
electrons in the CH bond. 

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:35.300
So when that vacant orbital, the
pi*, mixes with the 

00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:40.000
occupied orbital, whether it's
CH bond or, even higher, the 

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.100
unshared pair of oxygen, then
they mix, and the vacant 

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:47.933
orbital becomes higher and less
able to stabilize the 

00:27:47.933 --> 00:27:51.000
anion on the carbon here. 

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.833
So that's understood. 

00:27:55.833 --> 00:28:00.367
Now, notice that a cyanide
group, as we said before, a 

00:28:00.367 --> 00:28:02.767
so-called nitrile, has much the
same 

00:28:02.767 --> 00:28:04.133
character as a carbonyl. 

00:28:04.133 --> 00:28:09.633
In fact, this has the same
acidity as the ester does. 

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.667
Now, in an amide, so this amide,
has a pKa of 18. 

00:28:17.667 --> 00:28:18.967
Does that make sense to you? 

00:28:21.567 --> 00:28:22.800
What would you have predicted?

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.433
Ayesha?

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:35.000
If the aldehyde is here when you
have a bond next door, you 

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.200
get a little bit of raising the
vacant orbital, so it's 

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.167
not so good. 

00:28:41.167 --> 00:28:45.167
Unshared pair on oxygen is even
more important and makes 

00:28:45.167 --> 00:28:46.067
it not acidic. 

00:28:46.067 --> 00:28:48.800
What would you expect if,
instead of oxygen here, if I 

00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:49.933
had nitrogen? 

00:28:49.933 --> 00:28:51.333
How about its unshared pair? 

00:28:57.233 --> 00:28:59.733
STUDENT: The nitrogen pair would
be less shared because 

00:28:59.733 --> 00:29:02.733
it has a larger nuclear charge.

00:29:02.733 --> 00:29:03.633
PROFESSOR: Aha. 

00:29:03.633 --> 00:29:07.933
You've got everything right
except the periodic table. 

00:29:07.933 --> 00:29:13.867
Nitrogen comes before oxygen, so
nitrogen has less nuclear 

00:29:13.867 --> 00:29:17.533
charge than oxygen, so it's
unshared pair 

00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:19.367
is higher in energy. 

00:29:19.367 --> 00:29:20.500
So what would you expect? 

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.667
STUDENT: It would be more
shared. 

00:29:21.667 --> 00:29:23.867
PROFESSOR: It would mix even
more with pi*, 

00:29:23.867 --> 00:29:25.767
pi* would go up even more. 

00:29:25.767 --> 00:29:31.967
And it should be less acidic, it
should be greater than 24. 

00:29:31.967 --> 00:29:36.000
And the reason is that that's
not what ionizes. 

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.100
What ionizes is a hydrogen from
the nitrogen. 

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.400
So the amide is a little bit
like a carboxylic acid. 

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.667
So it's not comparable with
these others, actually. 

00:29:46.667 --> 00:29:49.800
But if you put two R groups on
the nitrogen, so it doesn't 

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:54.133
have a hydrogen it can lose,
then indeed it's less acidic 

00:29:54.133 --> 00:29:57.300
than the ester, which is what
you predicted once you get the 

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:58.633
periodic table right. 

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.833
Now, you can do even better if
you have two carbonyls. 

00:30:04.833 --> 00:30:09.900
So notice that all these are
weaker acids than water. 

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:13.900
So if you put them in with
hydroxide, the equilibrium 

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:18.367
will have the proton on them,
not on the water. 

00:30:18.367 --> 00:30:22.967
So you can, especially in the
cases up here, they're close 

00:30:22.967 --> 00:30:26.600
enough to water-- water's about
16, 15.7-- 

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.867
they're close enough that there
is some anion at 

00:30:29.867 --> 00:30:32.400
equilibrium, a significant
amount, so you can do 

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.367
reactions with it. 

00:30:34.367 --> 00:30:36.267
But mostly, it's not in that
form. 

00:30:36.267 --> 00:30:38.667
Mostly it's in the protonated
form. 

00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:41.833
But if you have two carbonyls,
then it becomes 

00:30:41.833 --> 00:30:42.600
quite acidic. 

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.167
And we spoke before, when we
were talking about the 

00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:48.833
Mitsunobu reaction, about active
methylene compounds. 

00:30:48.833 --> 00:30:53.233
Methylene groups, CH2 groups,
that are activated by two 

00:30:53.233 --> 00:30:56.833
adjacent pi* orbitals, so that
then they become much 

00:30:56.833 --> 00:30:57.433
more acidic. 

00:30:57.433 --> 00:31:00.900
This one has a pKa of 5. 

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.100
And if we have two methyl
groups, it's like going from 

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:04.000
here to here. 

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.533
The pKa is 9. 

00:31:05.533 --> 00:31:10.433
In fact, it looks uncannily good
for that, because if you 

00:31:10.433 --> 00:31:14.433
got two orders of magnitude by
putting on one methyl group, 

00:31:14.433 --> 00:31:17.567
from H to methyl, here when you
put on two, you get four 

00:31:17.567 --> 00:31:19.033
orders of magnitude. 

00:31:19.033 --> 00:31:24.600
That's spurious in how good the
agreement is. 

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.533
Because you see, if you put
ester on, instead of the 

00:31:27.533 --> 00:31:31.933
methyl, as we did here, ester
instead of methyl, the pKa 

00:31:31.933 --> 00:31:33.267
goes up, as it did here. 

00:31:33.267 --> 00:31:35.767
But here it went up five orders
of magnitude. 

00:31:35.767 --> 00:31:38.967
Here the acidity went up only
two orders of magnitude. 

00:31:38.967 --> 00:31:41.667
So they're really not additive
the way we were talking about, 

00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:44.300
but it's in the right direction.

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.267
If you have two esters, then
it's another 

00:31:46.267 --> 00:31:49.133
two orders of magnitude. 

00:31:49.133 --> 00:31:52.633
If you have nitrogen, it goes up
five orders of magnitude 

00:31:52.633 --> 00:31:54.500
for the reason that we-- 

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.900
in fact, compared to this one,
it went up 

00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.600
seven orders of magnitude. 

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.367
Over here, compared to the
ester, to the nitrogen, it 

00:32:02.367 --> 00:32:04.767
went up six orders of magnitude,
so that one looks 

00:32:04.767 --> 00:32:06.200
reasonable. 

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:11.800
And finally, if you have two
nitrile groups, it's still 

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.767
quite acidic. 

00:32:12.767 --> 00:32:16.500
And notice that all these are
stronger acids than water, 

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.667
except the one here, which was
deactivated by the unshared 

00:32:19.667 --> 00:32:21.700
pair of the nitrogen. 

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:26.167
So if you put these with base,
they'll be in the anionic form 

00:32:26.167 --> 00:32:29.567
with hyroxide or alkoxide. 

00:32:29.567 --> 00:32:29.900
OK. 

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:34.700
So you can get these anions from
the simple compounds-- 

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.433
a small amount at equilibrium in
strong base-- and for the 

00:32:39.433 --> 00:32:42.767
doubly activated compounds, in
high concentration, if you put 

00:32:42.767 --> 00:32:44.500
strong base in there. 

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.167
In fact, if you use an even
stronger base, like lithium 

00:32:49.167 --> 00:32:51.500
diisopropylamide-- 

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.567
so amide, remember, is a
confusing name, because it 

00:32:54.567 --> 00:32:58.533
means both the functional group
O=C-N, but it 

00:32:58.533 --> 00:33:01.567
also means a nitrogen anion, and
you just have to know from 

00:33:01.567 --> 00:33:04.433
context what you're talking
about. 

00:33:04.433 --> 00:33:06.433
So anyhow, this is a nitrogen
anion. 

00:33:06.433 --> 00:33:08.000
So it's a strong anion. 

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.900
The pKa is 36. 

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:17.900
So if you were to take this that
you don't get very good 

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.967
formation of pulling off this
hydrogen, the one that's much 

00:33:21.967 --> 00:33:23.167
deactivated, 

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.167
but you put it with this very
strong base-- 

00:33:25.167 --> 00:33:27.433
this one has a pKa of 25, 

00:33:27.433 --> 00:33:30.900
but this one has a pKa of 36--
so you have an equilibrium 

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.600
constant of 10 to the eleventh,
favoring formation 

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.333
of the anion. 

00:33:35.333 --> 00:33:41.167
So you could make 100%,
essentially, or just one part 

00:33:41.167 --> 00:33:45.500
in 10 to the eleventh, not that
way, if you use

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.333
this very strong base. 

00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:51.100
So sometimes, even these
alpha-anions that are difficult

00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:53.767
to make, if you use a really
strong base, you can 

00:33:53.767 --> 00:33:56.467
get them all made. 

00:33:56.467 --> 00:34:00.367
So you have complete formation,
even of the amide 

00:34:00.367 --> 00:34:04.900
enolate, and not just a little
bit of equilibrium. 

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.867
And noticed that it's a hindered
base. 

00:34:06.867 --> 00:34:09.400
It's not dimethyl or diethyl. 

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.100
It's diisopropyl. 

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.800
And you want it to be hindered,
because otherwise, 

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.333
this H isn't so very easy to
attack. 

00:34:16.333 --> 00:34:18.200
It would also be possible to
attack the 

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.700
carbonyl group, pi*. 

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:23.467
Add the nitrogen to this carbon,
and 

00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:24.933
lose the other nitrogen. 

00:34:24.933 --> 00:34:28.133
You don't want that to happen,
so you use a hindered one that 

00:34:28.133 --> 00:34:31.933
can only get at the hydrogen out
there. 

00:34:31.933 --> 00:34:33.400
Doesn't attack the enolate. 

00:34:36.133 --> 00:34:38.400
Now, when you make these things,
you have a 

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.167
nucleophilic alpha-carbon. 

00:34:40.167 --> 00:34:41.700
That's why you make them. 

00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:44.000
Carbon, remember, in the ways
we've 

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.600
talked about it mostly, is an
electrophile, R-halogen. 

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.000
The pi* of C=O, our low LUMOs. 

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.300
Here's a carbon that's a high
HOMO, the unshared pair here 

00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.300
on that alpha-carbon. 

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:03.067
So this allows you then to form
carbon-carbon bonds with 

00:35:03.067 --> 00:35:07.100
the other kinds, the
electrophilic carbons, by 

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.567
using that unshared pair to form
a new bond. 

00:35:10.567 --> 00:35:10.867
OK. 

00:35:10.867 --> 00:35:12.967
So let's look at some examples
of that. 

00:35:12.967 --> 00:35:16.500
And it could be done either with
acid- or base-catalysis 

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.967
via, in the acid case, enol, and
in the base 

00:35:19.967 --> 00:35:22.267
case, enolate anion. 

00:35:22.267 --> 00:35:24.033
And you know you know how to do
this. 

00:35:24.033 --> 00:35:25.900
I'm going to just zip through it
quickly. 

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:28.267
So a proton comes in. 

00:35:28.267 --> 00:35:32.000
In the acid-catalyzed case, you
get this cation, which is 

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.500
very stabilized, because of the
unshared pair 

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.333
on oxygen next door. 

00:35:37.333 --> 00:35:43.267
But that can lose a proton to
generate an enol. 

00:35:43.267 --> 00:35:46.867
But now, in the case of
hydrogen-deuterium exchange, 

00:35:46.867 --> 00:35:47.600
it's interesting. 

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.867
Because if D comes up, we can
reverse the reactions. 

00:35:51.867 --> 00:35:54.633
We could have reversed it this
way, and put a proton on. 

00:35:54.633 --> 00:35:57.667
But if you have a deuteron
available, then you can do it 

00:35:57.667 --> 00:36:04.167
this way, and go to there, and
now lose this D plus. 

00:36:04.167 --> 00:36:06.767
And what we've done is exchange,
in the alpha-position, 

00:36:06.767 --> 00:36:11.400
deuterium in place of hydrogen.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.133
So that's the acid-catalyzed
mechanism, which doesn't 

00:36:14.133 --> 00:36:15.400
surprise you. 

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.300
You can also do it with base
catalysis. 

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.967
You can have base come in and
take the proton, generating an 

00:36:22.967 --> 00:36:27.333
enolate anion, which of course
has this resonance structure. 

00:36:27.333 --> 00:36:31.367
And now we have this, as we had
here, a 

00:36:31.367 --> 00:36:34.033
nucleophilic carbon. 

00:36:34.033 --> 00:36:36.567
We also have a nucleophilic
carbon here. 

00:36:36.567 --> 00:36:41.300
So we can, in the enolate, we
could bring in 

00:36:41.300 --> 00:36:43.800
deuterated water. 

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:49.867
So either acid or base allows
you to exchange those protons. 

00:36:49.867 --> 00:36:53.333
And if there's more than one
proton in that alpha-position, 

00:36:53.333 --> 00:36:57.200
you can exchange the others, as
well. 

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.500
Now, notice that you can also
racemize in this way. 

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:04.300
Because if the other things
attached to this carbon were A 

00:37:04.300 --> 00:37:09.167
and B, you can go through
exactly the same scheme-- 

00:37:09.167 --> 00:37:10.567
acid or base. 

00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:12.733
But there's now configuration
here. 

00:37:12.733 --> 00:37:17.767
So if the H is in front of the
plane here, in this case, when 

00:37:17.767 --> 00:37:21.933
the H plus comes back on, it
could come either from the 

00:37:21.933 --> 00:37:25.633
front or from the back. 

00:37:25.633 --> 00:37:28.700
Because this thing is planar,
and this thing 

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.833
is planar, not chiral. 

00:37:30.833 --> 00:37:34.433
So we've lost the memory of
whether the thing was right- 

00:37:34.433 --> 00:37:35.533
or left-handed. 

00:37:35.533 --> 00:37:38.367
So it could come in from the
back just as easily as from 

00:37:38.367 --> 00:37:40.967
the front, and then we racemize.

00:37:40.967 --> 00:37:45.500
So either by deuterium exchange,
or by racemization, 

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:47.733
you can measure the rate at
which enolate 

00:37:47.733 --> 00:37:49.100
is formed and destroyed. 

00:37:51.967 --> 00:37:54.833
You could also do alpha-
halogenation. 

00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:56.833
And it's exactly the same scheme
again. 

00:37:56.833 --> 00:37:59.767
The only difference is, once you
get the enol or the 

00:37:59.767 --> 00:38:02.500
enolate, you react it with a
halogen. 

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:04.300
I've chosen to show iodine here.

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.967
You can do it with chlorine or
bromine as well. 

00:38:06.967 --> 00:38:12.100
So you can make an alpha-halo
ketone. 

00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.467
Nothing special here. 

00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:20.267
Now, the product we made was an
iodomethyl ketone. 

00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:23.633
But we could also do the
reaction with that. 

00:38:23.633 --> 00:38:27.433
If there's another hydrogen
here, we could do the 

00:38:27.433 --> 00:38:30.967
acid-catalyzed or the
base-catalyzed, and 

00:38:30.967 --> 00:38:33.333
get a diiodo compound. 

00:38:33.333 --> 00:38:35.000
Or can we? 

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.267
In fact, in this case, only one
of the pathways works. 

00:38:39.267 --> 00:38:42.633
And the reason is that the
iodine, the halogen, is 

00:38:42.633 --> 00:38:44.700
electron withdrawing. 

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:48.767
So it gives positive charge to
that carbon-- 

00:38:48.767 --> 00:38:50.533
partial positive charge. 

00:38:50.533 --> 00:38:53.800
That means that if you went up
here, you would be putting two 

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:57.633
positive charges next to one
another, which isn't so great. 

00:38:57.633 --> 00:39:03.233
So in fact, the acid catalyzed
pathway disappears after 

00:39:03.233 --> 00:39:04.967
you've added the first iodine. 

00:39:04.967 --> 00:39:07.633
So you can put one in, one
iodine, one chlorine, one 

00:39:07.633 --> 00:39:10.333
bromine, but you can't put the
second one in, because you 

00:39:10.333 --> 00:39:13.533
can't, with acid catalysis, get
the enol. 

00:39:13.533 --> 00:39:16.300
But if you have a positive
charge there, that's all the 

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:20.967
better for losing the proton and
getting the enolate. 

00:39:20.967 --> 00:39:23.333
So this is even faster, the
second one. 

00:39:23.333 --> 00:39:26.933
And what do you think happens
next? 

00:39:26.933 --> 00:39:32.367
If you have another hydrogen
there, right?-- 

00:39:32.367 --> 00:39:34.367
so there's the base catalyzed
one works-- 

00:39:34.367 --> 00:39:38.033
but now you can do it with a
diiodomethylketone and make a 

00:39:38.033 --> 00:39:40.167
triiodomethylketone. 

00:39:40.167 --> 00:39:40.467
OK? 

00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:41.867
So that's great. 

00:39:41.867 --> 00:39:44.933
What happens next with base? 

00:39:44.933 --> 00:39:49.033
Well, you can't have anymore
hydrogens on that one. 

00:39:49.033 --> 00:39:54.367
So if you brought in hydroxide
at this stage, it would attack 

00:39:54.367 --> 00:39:55.600
the carbonyl. 

00:39:57.567 --> 00:40:00.967
But when it does that, you could
imagine the OH coming 

00:40:00.967 --> 00:40:03.600
off again, although it's not
such a good leaving group. 

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:05.367
There's a better leaving group.

00:40:05.367 --> 00:40:09.167
What's the better leaving group?

00:40:09.167 --> 00:40:11.033
CI3. 

00:40:11.033 --> 00:40:14.767
With three halogens on the
carbon, it's a sufficiently 

00:40:14.767 --> 00:40:18.833
good anion that it can leave. So
we can unzip in that 

00:40:18.833 --> 00:40:21.500
direction, one of these
association-dissociation 

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.133
mechanisms, and get that. 

00:40:24.133 --> 00:40:28.900
Because and then, of course, you
want to 

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.233
transfer the proton-- 

00:40:31.233 --> 00:40:35.833
the pKa of the HCI3 is about 14,
so it's more 

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:37.833
acidic than water is. 

00:40:37.833 --> 00:40:38.200
OK. 

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.033
Now that's neat. 

00:40:39.033 --> 00:40:42.000
Because that compound,
iodoform-- 

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.433
remember, CHCI3 is chloroform, 

00:40:44.433 --> 00:40:45.533
this is iodoform-- 

00:40:45.533 --> 00:40:49.933
but whereas chloroform is a
colorless liquid, iodoform is 

00:40:49.933 --> 00:40:53.033
a yellow solid. 

00:40:53.033 --> 00:40:57.600
So this provided, in the days
before there was NMR-- 

00:40:57.600 --> 00:41:00.667
like if you had a methyl ketone
now, you'd look for a 

00:41:00.667 --> 00:41:06.000
methyl singlet shifted down
field at a 

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:06.900
certain position. 

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.733
We know from NMR how you would
identify it, 

00:41:08.733 --> 00:41:13.167
and in the carbon NMR, you'd
look at a particular place. 

00:41:13.167 --> 00:41:14.033
Right? 

00:41:14.033 --> 00:41:17.067
But in the days before there was
spectroscopy to identify 

00:41:17.067 --> 00:41:19.067
these things, how would you
would know if you had a methyl 

00:41:19.067 --> 00:41:23.633
ketone? You reacted it in water
with base and iodine, 

00:41:23.633 --> 00:41:26.367
and see whether you get a bright
yellow solid. 

00:41:26.367 --> 00:41:29.700
So this is a picture 

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.933
[fumbling with projection
controls] 

00:41:34.967 --> 00:41:36.433
and you can see, here are two
test tubes. 

00:41:36.433 --> 00:41:39.200
This one had a methyl ketone in
it, that one didn't. 

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:41.433
This one has a yellow
precipitate. 

00:41:41.433 --> 00:41:46.267
So that was a handy way of
identifying methyl ketones in 

00:41:46.267 --> 00:41:47.500
the days before spectroscopy. 

00:41:50.267 --> 00:41:56.233
Now, you can do this
alpha-halogenation with other 

00:41:56.233 --> 00:41:57.467
carbonyl groups, as well. 

00:41:57.467 --> 00:41:59.767
For example, carboxylic acids. 

00:41:59.767 --> 00:42:03.033
So we've seen before that you
can make an acid 

00:42:03.033 --> 00:42:04.167
chloride in this way. 

00:42:04.167 --> 00:42:07.533
And since I had it animated, I
decided to put it here so you 

00:42:07.533 --> 00:42:09.033
can review it, if you want to. 

00:42:13.267 --> 00:42:15.900
And that's how you get the acid
chloride. 

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.067
But one of the most charmingly
named reactions is the 

00:42:25.067 --> 00:42:28.667
Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction,
sometimes called the 

00:42:28.667 --> 00:42:30.033
HVZ reaction. 

00:42:30.033 --> 00:42:32.833
But if you remember
Hell-Volard-Zelinsky, that's 

00:42:32.833 --> 00:42:36.600
another one you can impress your
roommates with. 

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.800
So it was Hell did it first, and
then Volhard, and then 

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:45.200
Zelinsky, at about two year
intervals flanking 1885. 

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.467
So the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky-- 

00:42:47.467 --> 00:42:50.067
I forget whether I've got this
animated here or not-- 

00:42:50.067 --> 00:42:54.067
involves PBr3 and bromine. 

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.333
So the same way that SOCl2 can
make an acid chloride from an 

00:43:01.333 --> 00:43:04.833
acid, so can PBr3. 

00:43:04.833 --> 00:43:07.833
So the HVZ reaction. 

00:43:07.833 --> 00:43:16.200
Carboxylic acid reacts with PBr3
to give the acid 

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.033
chloride, or bromide. 

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.733
But the acid bromide is very
good at forming an enol. 

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:43.233
And if you have bromine present,
bromine can attack 

00:43:43.233 --> 00:43:47.300
the double bond, because the
cation will be stabilized with 

00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.533
oxygen next door. 

00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:05.733
So then when you lose the
proton, you have 

00:44:05.733 --> 00:44:11.067
alpha-bromination, bromination
adjacent to 

00:44:11.067 --> 00:44:12.900
the carbonyl group. 

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:17.233
So this was easy to do, because
the acid bromide is 

00:44:17.233 --> 00:44:20.800
good at forming the enol. 

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.767
But now it looks like you would
need to keep making the 

00:44:24.767 --> 00:44:29.233
acid bromide in order to
continue doing this reaction. 

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.233
But in fact, this can be
catalytic. 

00:44:36.333 --> 00:44:37.700
Why can it be catalytic? 

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.200
Why do you need only a little
bit? 

00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.467
You need a full mole of this, of
course. 

00:44:41.467 --> 00:44:43.100
Because this can react with
acid. 

00:44:57.233 --> 00:45:03.167
So it displaces the bromide, and
we have Br, so that the 

00:45:03.167 --> 00:45:07.200
brominated product, but now in
the form of an acid anhydride. 

00:45:11.333 --> 00:45:16.600
A different acid derivative. 

00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:34.833
But we also have Br minus, which
can attack here and then 

00:45:34.833 --> 00:45:36.067
this comes-- 

00:45:38.433 --> 00:45:39.700
yeah. 

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:42.767
What have I done wrong? 

00:45:42.767 --> 00:45:43.600
Oh, I'm losing it. 

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.100
Yeah. 

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:45.367
Right? 

00:45:45.367 --> 00:45:48.200
And then back here. 

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:51.167
Because I didn't have the Br, I
wasn't thinking right. 

00:45:55.467 --> 00:46:01.067
So now we have the acid, plus
the other product 

00:46:01.067 --> 00:46:03.667
you can see is Br. 

00:46:08.167 --> 00:46:11.400
So we traded which one was acid
bromide and which one was 

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:14.367
carboxylic acid. 

00:46:14.367 --> 00:46:19.000
So now this can give this, and
this is a 

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.533
cycle that goes around. 

00:46:22.533 --> 00:46:25.400
So you only need this to get it
started, to get the first 

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:28.467
bromide, and the subsequent
bromides can come from that. 

00:46:28.467 --> 00:46:31.833
And the actual product, then,
ultimately is-- 

00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:35.967
remember, H plus came off here--

00:46:35.967 --> 00:46:38.600
so the ultimate product is the
alpha-brominated acid. 

00:46:48.967 --> 00:46:51.200
I was hoping I'd get further
than this. 

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.733
I'm going to go-- 

00:46:52.733 --> 00:46:54.000
well, let's see. 

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.567
Yeah, I'll go just this slide. 

00:46:56.567 --> 00:46:57.833
So alpha-alkylation. 

00:47:02.167 --> 00:47:08.933
We promised before that the real
advantage of having these 

00:47:08.933 --> 00:47:12.767
carbon nucleophiles is the
possibility of putting an R 

00:47:12.767 --> 00:47:15.533
group on there. 

00:47:15.533 --> 00:47:19.467
So you do this with-- 

00:47:23.033 --> 00:47:24.300
see, what do I have here? 

00:47:28.433 --> 00:47:38.433
So you use a base, you get an
enolate from 

00:47:38.433 --> 00:47:40.900
your ketone or aldehyde. 

00:47:47.233 --> 00:47:53.533
And now, this you react with
something like methyl iodide, 

00:47:53.533 --> 00:47:55.700
so an electrophilic carbon,
sigma*. 

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:04.367
And you can make a new
carbon-carbon bond, 

00:48:04.367 --> 00:48:05.767
alpha.

00:48:05.767 --> 00:48:09.867
So the same way we could put
bromine in alpha, or hydrogen 

00:48:09.867 --> 00:48:14.100
in alpha, we could put methyl in
alpha. 

00:48:17.433 --> 00:48:19.867
But there's a problem here. 

00:48:19.867 --> 00:48:22.033
Because we also have the
possibility that it could

00:48:22.033 --> 00:48:23.267
react here. 

00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:33.467
So "Which nucleophile wins?"
is the question. 

00:48:36.133 --> 00:48:43.233
I think I probably should let
you go now, and we'll go on to 

00:48:43.233 --> 00:48:46.767
resolve the Perils of Pauline
the next time.

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.404
Prof: At the end last
time we asked the question

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.640
whether molecular mechanics
programs are useful?

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.519
And the answer is yes;
in fact, they're really

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.669
nowadays indispensable for
evaluating the energy of

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.560
molecules and their shapes.
 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.040
But are they true?
 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.694
Are they really fundamentally
correct, the same way we believe

00:00:21.694 --> 00:00:24.570
quantum mechanics to be
fundamentally correct?

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.300
And the answer to that is
certainly no.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.365
We already saw how they depend
on so many arbitrary parameters

00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:36.680
that are just adjusted to try to
fit data from some molecules.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680
And then there's the hope that
they'll fit other molecules,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.060
and sometimes they do and
sometimes they don't.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.981
They usually do pretty well,
but there can be special cases

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:49.903
that differ for some reason,
and it's hard to predict those

00:00:49.903 --> 00:00:50.810
ahead of time.
 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.345
So one has to look at them with
a certain grain of salt.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:57.050
Okay?
 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.070
A good example of where they're
demonstrably incorrect is in the

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.051
question of van der Waals radii;
for example,

00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:10.888
the contact between two bromine
atoms that are not bonded to one

00:01:10.888 --> 00:01:11.560
another.
 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.388
So we're going to make a plot
showing a bromine attached to

00:01:15.388 --> 00:01:18.138
carbon,
and we're going to do this in

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:22.173
the same spirit that Dunitz and
his crew looked at amines

00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:23.830
attacking carbonyls.
 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.670
We're going to look at many,
many crystal structures,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.235
and we're going to have --
we're going to rotate the

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:32.305
various structures so that they
have a C-Br bond that lines up

00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:33.110
right there.
 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.555
And then we're going to see how
far it is to the nearest

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:41.191
neighboring bromine,
from some other molecule.

00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:41.920
Okay?
 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.750
And now what would we expect?
 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.239
Well there's a certain van der
Waals radius for bromine.

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:52.083
So the next neighbor should
have its bromine in contact with

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:52.800
that one.
 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.300
So we should go that radius
again, to get to a neighbor.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.750
And there should be various
directions,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.519
of course, where the neighbor
could be,

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:06.025
but always at that same
distance, if they're in contact

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:07.129
with one another.
 

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:07.650
Okay?
 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.068
So there should be an arc of a
circle, like that.

00:02:12.068 --> 00:02:14.770
So if we make these -- if we
rotate these various crystal

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.699
structures that have been
determined,

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.955
so the C and Br line up there,
and the other Br lies in the

00:02:20.955 --> 00:02:23.578
plane --
the neighboring Br from another

00:02:23.578 --> 00:02:26.394
molecule --
then the closest they should

00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:29.000
get is along that dashed red
line.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.501
Now, of course,
there could be others that are

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:33.669
further away,
that aren't in contact.

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:36.740
And in fact there could be some
that are a little bit closer.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.210
You'd really expect some to be
a little bit closer.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.678
Because there's van der Waals
attraction, out to infinite

00:02:42.678 --> 00:02:44.554
distance;
at least to great -- to

00:02:44.554 --> 00:02:47.254
substantial distance,
much further than where they're

00:02:47.254 --> 00:02:48.449
actually in contact.
 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.250
They're attracting one another.
 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.962
So this bromine is part of a
molecule that has many atoms in

00:02:53.962 --> 00:02:57.740
it, and the other bromine is
part of a molecule that has many

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.370
atoms.
 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.784
And all these other atoms are
attracting one another,

00:03:01.784 --> 00:03:03.688
pulling toward one another.
 

00:03:03.688 --> 00:03:06.145
Now, of course,
it would just collapse,

00:03:06.145 --> 00:03:09.443
except for the fact that the
ones, the closest ones,

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:11.060
run into one another.
 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.822
But that means that they should
get slightly closer than just

00:03:15.822 --> 00:03:19.258
precise contact,
because they're being pushed

00:03:19.258 --> 00:03:22.840
together by all the other atoms
in those molecules.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.128
So we would expect neighbors to
be slightly closer;

00:03:26.128 --> 00:03:29.230
some of the neighbors,
at least, to be slightly closer

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.626
than this van der Waals radius,
or double the van der Waals

00:03:32.626 --> 00:03:35.598
radius;
whatever the van der Waals

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:36.763
radius means.
 

00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:37.479
Right?
 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.530
The question is where you get
that.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.866
But, at any rate,
we could -- you can look up in

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:44.998
a book and see what they say the
van der Waals radius of bromine

00:03:44.998 --> 00:03:46.690
is, and make a plot like this.
 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.092
And then you'll put points on
it, for all the different

00:03:49.092 --> 00:03:51.539
crystal structures of where
neighboring bromines are.

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:53.310
And they look like this.
 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.397
Here's what I just said:
To balance attractive and

00:03:56.397 --> 00:03:59.675
repulsive forces between
neighbors, the closest atoms

00:03:59.675 --> 00:04:01.628
must be a little bit too close.
 

00:04:01.628 --> 00:04:02.259
Okay?
 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.128
And here's what you see.
 

00:04:03.128 --> 00:04:06.585
And indeed, some of the atoms,
in some of the cases,

00:04:06.585 --> 00:04:08.550
are a little bit too close.
 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.245
And, of course,
many are further because other

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.719
atoms are running into one
another, of these two molecules.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:15.258
Okay?
 

00:04:15.258 --> 00:04:21.024
Well what do you find
particularly curious about this

00:04:21.024 --> 00:04:21.800
plot?
 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.470
Anything?
 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.740
Chenyu?
 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.189
Student:  It's not
really circular.

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:29.519
Prof: I can't hear very
well.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.439
Student:  It's not
really circular.

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.769
Prof: It's not circular.
 

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:35.190
It's an ellipse. Right?
 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.452
There are many more inside the
red dashed line at the top than

00:04:39.452 --> 00:04:40.709
out to the side.
 

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:47.778
So what do you infer from that,
about the shape of the bromine

00:04:47.778 --> 00:04:48.589
atom?
 

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:50.769
Student:  It's not
spherical.

00:04:50.769 --> 00:04:53.113
Prof: It's not
spherical.

00:04:53.113 --> 00:04:53.720
Right?
 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.310
Okay.
 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.206
So the bromine atoms seem not
to be spherical.

00:05:00.206 --> 00:05:00.899
Right?
 

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:05.259
But every molecular mechanics
program calculates van der Waals

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.120
interactions between atoms as if
they are spherical.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.074
The interaction depends only on
the distance,

00:05:12.074 --> 00:05:13.485
not on the direction.
 

00:05:13.485 --> 00:05:14.088
Right?
 

00:05:14.088 --> 00:05:18.427
So clearly molecular mechanics
programs are not perfect.

00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:19.060
Right?
 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.040
But still they're pretty good,
and you can get interesting

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.079
information out of them -- from
them.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.663
Plus, they can tell you
something about

00:05:26.663 --> 00:05:30.879
why something
might be the way it is -- right?

00:05:30.879 --> 00:05:32.839
-- torsional energy and things
like that.

00:05:32.839 --> 00:05:36.600
Okay, and in fact if you're
trying to deal with a big

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.649
molecule, it's hopeless to do
quantum mechanics on it.

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:45.000
So here's angiostatin,
which is an anti-cancer drug.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.552
And this is the largest -- at
least as of a couple of years

00:05:48.552 --> 00:05:50.745
ago;
I suspect it's still the case

00:05:50.745 --> 00:05:54.586
-- this is the largest molecule
whose shape has been optimized

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:55.910
by quantum mechanics.
 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:56.540
Right?
 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.500
And not a really high level of
quantum mechanics.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.223
Here's a description of it from
Mike Frisch, from Gaussian

00:06:04.223 --> 00:06:06.129
Incorporated in 2003.
 

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:08.107
He said: "We optimized
Kringle 1"

00:06:08.107 --> 00:06:10.947
(which is this thing;
I don't know why you call it

00:06:10.947 --> 00:06:14.586
Kringle 1) "with the AM1
method" (which is a very

00:06:14.586 --> 00:06:18.290
low-level of quantum mechanics)
"using Gaussian 03.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.339
Plasminogen Kringle 1 contains
1200 atoms, which are made up of

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:27.250
642 non-hydrogen atoms and 578
hydrogen atoms.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.276
The job takes about 650
optimization steps,

00:06:30.276 --> 00:06:34.240
starting from the molecular
mechanics geometry."

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.149
So first they used molecular
mechanics to get the approximate

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:39.339
structure,
and then they started adjusting

00:06:39.339 --> 00:06:41.634
it with quantum mechanics,
step by step,

00:06:41.634 --> 00:06:45.449
until after 650 steps they got
to a minimum of energy,

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:46.399
and that's this energy.
 

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:49.670
But obviously this is not an
everyday occurrence,

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:51.579
to do something like this.
 

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:54.889
So if you're dealing with a big
biological molecule,

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.161
you have to use molecular
mechanics.

00:06:57.161 --> 00:06:57.810
Right?
 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.800
But you know that fundamentally
it's not right.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.315
It may get a lot of things
right, but don't believe that it

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:06.620
came down from Sinai on the
tablets.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.709
Right?
 

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:09.360
Yes Lucas?
 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.670
Student:  How long did
it take to do just one

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.029
calculation?
 

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:12.550
Prof: I don't know.
 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.639
We could ask him sometime.
 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:15.000
He's around here from time to
time.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.839
I haven't set him up to come in.
 

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:23.149
Okay.
 

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:26.464
So quantum mechanics is pretty
close, as we believe,

00:07:26.464 --> 00:07:27.439
to the truth.
 

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:30.180
Molecular mechanics isn't close
to the truth but for practical

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.528
purposes it's indispensable.
 

00:07:31.528 --> 00:07:36.137
Now, we wonder whether the
standard structural model of

00:07:36.137 --> 00:07:40.490
molecules that we have is
realistic in its geometric

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.478
detail;
things about bonds,

00:07:42.478 --> 00:07:44.519
bond lengths,
bond angles and so on.

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:47.509
And how are we going to know
whether it is?

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.461
We're going to use X-ray
diffraction to see just how

00:07:51.461 --> 00:07:53.709
regular bond distances are.
 

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:58.158
Okay, now we're helped in this
by what's called the Cambridge

00:07:58.158 --> 00:07:59.790
Structural Database.
 

00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:02.043
In Cambridge,
in England, there's this

00:08:02.043 --> 00:08:05.514
building where people sit and
collect X-ray structure data

00:08:05.514 --> 00:08:09.745
from all over the world,
and make it computer-searchable

00:08:09.745 --> 00:08:11.910
and so on,
so that you can look at many,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:12.620
many structures.
 

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.209
And you see that many
structures are available.

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:18.898
This is how many structures
there are, as of any particular

00:08:18.898 --> 00:08:21.759
year, in the Cambridge
Structural Database.

00:08:21.759 --> 00:08:25.442
And you see it's up to about
half a million X-ray structures

00:08:25.442 --> 00:08:28.250
have been determined,
and put in the Cambridge

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:29.750
Database, as of now.
 

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:32.173
You can click on there and go
to the website to see it,

00:08:32.173 --> 00:08:33.610
if you want;
it's interesting.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:38.097
Okay, and they predict that
there'll be half a million by

00:08:38.097 --> 00:08:38.658
2010.
 

00:08:38.658 --> 00:08:42.741
Okay, now how many atoms are
there -- this is how many

00:08:42.741 --> 00:08:45.899
structures -- how many atoms are
there?

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:47.308
How many bonds in each
structure?

00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:50.283
Well, as time goes on,
X-ray is able to do more and

00:08:50.283 --> 00:08:52.009
more complicated molecules.
 

00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:56.096
So that at the beginning there
were only about an average of

00:08:56.096 --> 00:08:58.658
twenty-seven atoms in a
structure,

00:08:58.658 --> 00:09:03.432
but by 1982 there were
forty-four, and by 1990 there

00:09:03.432 --> 00:09:06.672
were fifty-four,
and after 2002,

00:09:06.672 --> 00:09:09.778
or something like that,
there were seventy-three.

00:09:09.778 --> 00:09:11.778
So the molecules are getting
bigger and bigger.

00:09:11.778 --> 00:09:15.196
And, as of now,
as of at least this last

00:09:15.196 --> 00:09:18.602
January,
the last issue of the database,

00:09:18.602 --> 00:09:22.860
there were thirty and a half
million atom positions,

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.585
x,y,z
coordinates, available.

00:09:25.585 --> 00:09:26.028
Right?
 

00:09:26.028 --> 00:09:28.394
And, of course,
there are many more bonds than

00:09:28.394 --> 00:09:30.864
there are atoms,
because most atoms form several

00:09:30.864 --> 00:09:31.389
bonds.
 

00:09:31.389 --> 00:09:35.197
So there are greater than forty
million bond distances

00:09:35.197 --> 00:09:36.058
available.
 

00:09:36.058 --> 00:09:38.940
Now the question is,
how regular are they?

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:42.370
Do carbon-carbon bond distances
tend to be the same?

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.663
Well in 1987,
when the Cambridge Database was

00:09:45.663 --> 00:09:50.005
much smaller than it is now,
it was already large enough to

00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:53.298
do pretty good statistics on
this thing.

00:09:53.298 --> 00:09:55.788
And here's a paper published in
that year,

00:09:55.788 --> 00:09:57.058
that you could look at if you
want to,

00:09:57.058 --> 00:10:00.828
by people from the
Crystallographic Data Center in

00:10:00.828 --> 00:10:03.558
Cambridge,
that talked about this subject.

00:10:03.558 --> 00:10:09.553
Now here's a table that shows
how many different kinds of

00:10:09.553 --> 00:10:14.798
bonds they divided the
experimental data into,

00:10:14.798 --> 00:10:20.028
so that within any given type
the bonds would all be about the

00:10:20.028 --> 00:10:21.057
same length.
 

00:10:21.057 --> 00:10:21.830
Right?
 

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.370
It's not surprising that
different types of bonds have

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.330
different lengths.
 

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.668
But if you subdivide -- like
double bonds and single bonds

00:10:28.668 --> 00:10:30.192
will be different lengths.
 

00:10:30.192 --> 00:10:30.720
Right?
 

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.158
So those would be at least two
types.

00:10:32.158 --> 00:10:34.519
But notice how many types they
used.

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:39.091
So, for example,
there are 119 different types

00:10:39.091 --> 00:10:44.580
of carbon-oxygen bonds,
that they did statistics on;

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.255
not bonds but types of bonds.
 

00:10:47.255 --> 00:10:47.808
Okay?
 

00:10:47.808 --> 00:10:51.320
Now here are those 119
different types.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:56.980
There are sixty types that are
made up of an sp^3 carbon

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:59.720
bonding to an O of type two.
 

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.673
And there are seventeen types
of bonds, which have sp^2

00:11:05.673 --> 00:11:09.480
carbon bonded to that type of
carbon.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.009
O2 means the oxygen has bonded
to two different atoms;

00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:15.402
O1 it's bonded to just one
atom.

00:11:15.402 --> 00:11:16.019
Right?
 

00:11:16.019 --> 00:11:19.532
There are four types where it's
an aromatic carbon that's bonded

00:11:19.532 --> 00:11:22.580
to a divalent oxygen,
and there are thirty-eight

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:26.527
where an sp^2 carbon is
bonded to an oxygen that makes

00:11:26.527 --> 00:11:29.629
bonds to only one carbon;
that is, a C-O double bond.

00:11:29.629 --> 00:11:33.243
So there are thirty-eight
different types of C-O double

00:11:33.243 --> 00:11:33.644
bonds.
 

00:11:33.644 --> 00:11:34.178
Okay?
 

00:11:34.178 --> 00:11:37.269
Or, in the case of C-N,
there are ninety-seven

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:40.769
different types of C-N bonds in
their tabulation.

00:11:40.769 --> 00:11:45.471
And for carbon there are 175
different types of carbon-carbon

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:46.100
bonds.
 

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.150
And notice that there are
twenty-seven different types of

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:54.635
carbon-carbon bonds where both
the carbons are sp^3 hybridized.

00:11:54.635 --> 00:11:55.360
Right?
 

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.011
So they're dividing this into
lots and lots of different

00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:03.129
categories, in order to get
regularity within each category.

00:12:03.129 --> 00:12:08.938
Now let's look here at those
twenty-seven different kinds of

00:12:08.938 --> 00:12:13.073
bonds that are carbon
sp^3 to carbon

00:12:13.073 --> 00:12:14.649
sp^3.
 

00:12:14.649 --> 00:12:19.033
Okay, so for each type is given
the mean and the median -- two

00:12:19.033 --> 00:12:21.909
kinds of average of the bond
distance;

00:12:21.909 --> 00:12:26.501
what the standard deviation is;
what the distance is that

00:12:26.501 --> 00:12:31.405
splits off the shortest
one-fourth, and the longest

00:12:31.405 --> 00:12:35.058
one-fourth;
and then how many different

00:12:35.058 --> 00:12:40.038
examples there were to do this,
to make the statistics on.

00:12:40.038 --> 00:12:42.500
Okay so now,
in this table,

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:47.330
C with a pound sign means any
sp^3 carbon.

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:54.000
So at the top there we see a
CH_3 bonded to CH_2.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.059
So that's the bond distance
we're interested in;

00:12:56.059 --> 00:12:57.370
methyl to CH_2.
 

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:01.235
But that CH_2 has some other
sp^3 carbon on it.

00:13:01.235 --> 00:13:01.820
Right?
 

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:03.149
So that's one type of bond.
 

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:06.678
And you notice the mean
distance is 1.513.

00:13:06.678 --> 00:13:11.437
And if there are two sp^3
carbons on the second

00:13:11.437 --> 00:13:14.490
carbon, then it's 1.524 average.
 

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.649
And if there are three of them,
it's 1.534.

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:21.789
Now notice the standard
deviation is about 1% of the

00:13:21.789 --> 00:13:23.090
bond distance.
 

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:28.590
So within that class they're
all within about + or - 1%.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:29.389
Right?
 

00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:31.658
So a very small deviation.
 

00:13:31.658 --> 00:13:35.970
So they wanted to get them --
they wanted to make the classes

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:40.279
restricted enough that you'd
have a predictable bond distance

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:40.926
-- right?
 

00:13:40.926 --> 00:13:42.220
-- within 1%.
 

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:47.158
Okay, notice that crowding
seems to stretch the bond.

00:13:47.158 --> 00:13:50.123
As you put more carbons on that
second carbon,

00:13:50.123 --> 00:13:53.812
which is bonded to methyl,
the bond to methyl gets longer

00:13:53.812 --> 00:13:56.508
and longer;
longer by a little less than

00:13:56.508 --> 00:13:59.620
1%, as you put more crowding on
the second carbon.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:04.412
Here's a graph of it,
of that, the standard deviation

00:14:04.412 --> 00:14:05.610
and the mean.
 

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.440
Right?
 

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.976
So you see it gets,
as you go from one R to two R's

00:14:08.976 --> 00:14:11.817
to three R's on the second
carbon, the bond gets a little

00:14:11.817 --> 00:14:16.250
longer and a little longer;
although they can overlap. Okay?

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:20.851
Now then we go down to here,
where both carbons are

00:14:20.851 --> 00:14:22.139
substituted.
 

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:25.866
So the first carbon has two or
three carbons on it,

00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:30.340
and the second carbon also has
two or three carbons on it.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.200
And now you see there's still
more crowding.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.700
They get longer and longer.
 

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.844
And, in fact,
when you have three other

00:14:36.844 --> 00:14:40.570
carbons on each of the carbons
whose bond you're interested in,

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.548
then those others repel one
another,

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:45.860
by van der Waals repulsion,
and it gets actually pretty

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:46.168
long.
 

00:14:46.168 --> 00:14:46.720
Right?
 

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:51.259
It gets almost 10% -- well 7%
longer, or something like that.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:54.712
So anyhow, you can get these
kinds of regularities,

00:14:54.712 --> 00:14:56.509
based on the statistics.
 

00:14:56.509 --> 00:15:02.072
And if you wanted just an
overall average carbon-carbon

00:15:02.072 --> 00:15:06.192
bond distance,
it's about 1.53 angstroms.

00:15:06.192 --> 00:15:07.120
Okay?
 

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.344
However, if you have
cyclopropane,

00:15:10.344 --> 00:15:13.666
or cyclobutane,
then the bonds are,

00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:17.965
in the case of cyclopropane,
unusually short,

00:15:17.965 --> 00:15:22.548
1.51;
and in the case of cyclobutane,

00:15:22.548 --> 00:15:24.813
unusually long,
1.55.

00:15:24.813 --> 00:15:25.720
Okay?
 

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.658
Now if you have sp^3-
sp^2, as a carbon-carbon

00:15:30.658 --> 00:15:34.173
bond, rather than
sp^3- sp^3,

00:15:34.173 --> 00:15:36.769
then what would you expect?
 

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:39.638
Would you expect a shorter bond
or a longer bond,

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:41.549
if one of them is sp^2?
 

00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:44.090
Just guess.
 

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:45.590
Student:  Repeat the
question.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.167
Prof: sp^2 means
you'll get better overlap,

00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:53.298
stronger bond;
probably a shorter bond. Right?

00:15:53.298 --> 00:15:56.344
Just a little review for you
here.

00:15:56.344 --> 00:15:56.990
Okay?
 

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.389
And indeed, 1.50 is the average.
 

00:16:00.389 --> 00:16:03.345
So there are hundreds and
hundreds of these,

00:16:03.345 --> 00:16:06.298
as you can see,
in this particular paper.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:09.466
But if you want just
order-of-magnitude things --

00:16:09.466 --> 00:16:12.570
actually it's better than
order-of-magnitude.

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:17.344
But for carbon-carbon single
bonds, it's about 1.53

00:16:17.344 --> 00:16:18.490
angstroms.
 

00:16:18.490 --> 00:16:21.610
For double bonds, 1.32.
 

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.950
For triple bonds, 1.18.
 

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.379
And for aromatic bonds,
say within a benzene ring,

00:16:27.379 --> 00:16:29.690
these are one-and-a-half bonds.
 

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:35.243
So not surprisingly they come
between single and double.

00:16:35.243 --> 00:16:35.950
Okay?
 

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:39.594
Notice they're a little closer
to double than they are to

00:16:39.594 --> 00:16:41.922
single;
1.38 to 1.32,

00:16:41.922 --> 00:16:46.210
as opposed to 1.38 versus 1.53.
 

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.043
Does it surprise you that
they're a little closer to

00:16:49.043 --> 00:16:50.210
double than single?
 

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:55.000
Notice, even if they were
single bonds,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.879
but between carbons that were
part of aromatic rings,

00:17:00.879 --> 00:17:06.660
they would be sp^2-
sp^2 carbon-carbon bonds.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:10.122
And we've already seen that
those would be unusually short.

00:17:10.122 --> 00:17:10.598
Right?
 

00:17:10.598 --> 00:17:13.088
So you don't expect it to be
one-and-a-half,

00:17:13.088 --> 00:17:15.578
the average between a normal
single and a normal double,

00:17:15.578 --> 00:17:18.440
if you think about it with a
little more sophistication.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:22.698
Okay, and then as we see here,
a single, if it's

00:17:22.698 --> 00:17:25.868
sp^3- sp^2,
is 1.5;

00:17:25.868 --> 00:17:28.234
and a single,
if it's sp^2-

00:17:28.234 --> 00:17:29.548
sp^2, is 1.46.
 

00:17:29.548 --> 00:17:35.701
So the 1.38 is closer to being
halfway between 1.46 and 1.32,

00:17:35.701 --> 00:17:39.288
than it is between 1.53 and
1.32.

00:17:39.288 --> 00:17:43.198
So depending on how accurate
your model needs to be,

00:17:43.198 --> 00:17:47.106
you can get pretty good
guesses, based on values you

00:17:47.106 --> 00:17:49.098
would find in a table.
 

00:17:49.098 --> 00:17:53.618
Now you can see some
interesting departures from

00:17:53.618 --> 00:17:54.868
regularity.
 

00:17:54.868 --> 00:18:02.220
Here I'll show it in aromatic
carbon-to-nitrogen bonds.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.279
So there's an aniline
derivative.

00:18:05.279 --> 00:18:08.068
Aniline is aminobenzene.
 

00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:11.167
Okay, so there's -- that red
bond is the bond we're talking

00:18:11.167 --> 00:18:13.037
about, and there's the
distribution,

00:18:13.037 --> 00:18:14.640
a histogram,
of distances.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.250
What's funny about the
histogram?

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.538
Dana?
 

00:18:21.538 --> 00:18:22.970
Student:  There's one
that's suddenly low.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.809
Prof: There's a hole in
the middle.

00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:25.170
Right?
 

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.910
It's bimodal. Right?
 

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:33.476
So it looks like there are two
different kinds of bonds between

00:18:33.476 --> 00:18:35.759
nitrogen and aromatic carbon.
 

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:38.866
Now let's split them out,
the ones that are in one and

00:18:38.866 --> 00:18:42.210
the ones that are in the other,
and see why they have this

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.088
difference.
 

00:18:43.088 --> 00:18:47.602
It turns out that if you do
ones where the nitrogen and the

00:18:47.602 --> 00:18:50.480
benzene are co-planar,
as shown above,

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.358
then you have one nice
histogram.

00:18:53.358 --> 00:18:58.661
And if the nitrogen is
pyramidal, rather than being

00:18:58.661 --> 00:19:02.690
planar, then it's another
histogram.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.740
So it depends on whether the
nitrogen is planar or pyramidal.

00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:10.096
But when the nitrogen is
planar, it's co-planar with the

00:19:10.096 --> 00:19:10.890
benzene.
 

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:12.990
And for good reason.
 

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:16.387
It's so that the unshared pair
on the nitrogen can be

00:19:16.387 --> 00:19:19.851
delocalized into vacant
orbitals, π orbitals

00:19:19.851 --> 00:19:21.420
of the benzene ring.
 

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.275
So that makes this
carbon-to-nitrogen bond a little

00:19:25.275 --> 00:19:28.358
bit double bond-like,
and shortens it.

00:19:28.358 --> 00:19:32.108
Whereas if the nitrogen is
twisted,

00:19:32.108 --> 00:19:35.320
compared to the benzene,
then there's no reason for it

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.212
to be flat,
to have a p orbital that

00:19:38.212 --> 00:19:40.849
will overlap with the benzene
orbitals.

00:19:40.849 --> 00:19:42.779
So it becomes pyramidal.
 

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:45.528
But more importantly,
there's no double-bond

00:19:45.528 --> 00:19:48.660
character anymore,
to the carbon-nitrogen bond.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:52.964
So the bonds are longer than
the ones that are partial double

00:19:52.964 --> 00:19:53.539
bonds.
 

00:19:53.539 --> 00:19:55.029
So that's why it's bimodal.
 

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:59.220
So you learn something from
these statistical analyses.

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.722
You have poor π
overlap when the nitrogen-carbon

00:20:02.722 --> 00:20:03.828
bond is twisted.
 

00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:09.613
Now, how complex must a model
be in order to predict useful

00:20:09.613 --> 00:20:10.910
structures?
 

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.296
So from the point of view of
the Cambridge compilers,

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:18.074
they wanted to get standard
deviations and bond distance of

00:20:18.074 --> 00:20:20.680
about 1%, as you saw from the
table.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:25.284
And in order to do this,
as you saw, they needed 175

00:20:25.284 --> 00:20:30.250
different kinds of C-C bonds,
differing in these various

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:35.252
ways, as we've illustrated;
and 97 different types of C-N

00:20:35.252 --> 00:20:38.140
and 119 different types of C-O
bonds.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.082
And 682 different kinds of
bonds altogether,

00:20:42.082 --> 00:20:44.098
in their tabulation.
 

00:20:44.098 --> 00:20:49.480
Okay, now we have ambitious
goals.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.490
We want to understand all stuff;
chemicals that is. Okay?

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.976
We wonder how things behave --
their properties -- and their

00:20:57.976 --> 00:21:00.409
chemical transformations as
well.

00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:01.170
Right?
 

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:04.827
And the key to doing this,
the trick we're going to use,

00:21:04.827 --> 00:21:08.752
is to understand the basis of
structure -- how the atoms are

00:21:08.752 --> 00:21:10.548
arranged -- and energy.
 

00:21:10.548 --> 00:21:14.210
And we want to do this in terms
of bonds.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:16.750
You could do it entirely
without bonds;

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:20.946
just use quantum mechanics to
minimize energies of atoms,

00:21:20.946 --> 00:21:25.220
of arrangements of atoms,
and calculate those energies.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.720
And you'd have that same
information, structure and

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.920
energy, but you wouldn't
understand anything,

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.269
you couldn't predict anything
in your head.

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:36.060
With bonds, you have a tool
that will allow you to predict

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:36.660
things.
 

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.598
Okay, so let's just see how
well bonds do.

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:43.654
Obviously there are going to be
corrections, having to do with

00:21:43.654 --> 00:21:47.308
conformation and strain,
as we've been talking about.

00:21:47.308 --> 00:21:51.750
But is there an underlying
energy for a given composition,

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.490
or a given constitution,
a given set of bonds?

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:58.380
Can you predict energy as well
as structure?

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:03.390
In other words,
how standard are bond energies?

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:06.987
If we're going to do our
understanding in terms of bonds,

00:22:06.987 --> 00:22:10.840
can you add up energies for all
the bonds and get the overall

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.640
energy for the molecule?
 

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.957
Knowing, of course,
that there are going to be

00:22:14.957 --> 00:22:16.759
corrections for strain and so
on.

00:22:16.759 --> 00:22:21.269
Okay, so this started in 1868
already.

00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:25.327
In the very first issue,
the second paper of the first

00:22:25.327 --> 00:22:28.390
issue of the German chemical
journal,

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.295
Chemische
Berichte,

00:22:30.295 --> 00:22:33.808
which was the journal of the
Chemical Society of Berlin,

00:22:33.808 --> 00:22:35.980
the second paper ever in that
journal,

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.500
was "On the Regularity and
Calculation of Heat of

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.160
Combustion of Organic
Compounds."

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.530
So Hermann was interested in
this because he was a

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:49.727
physiologist and he wanted to
know how much energy you get out

00:22:49.727 --> 00:22:52.203
of the food you burn up in your
body.

00:22:52.203 --> 00:22:53.029
Right?
 

00:22:53.029 --> 00:22:56.755
So could you predict,
on the basis of what substances

00:22:56.755 --> 00:22:59.835
you eat, how much energy could
be available?

00:22:59.835 --> 00:23:00.480
Okay?
 

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:03.140
So physiology led him to study
this.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.578
And there was another paper,
very shortly after that,

00:23:06.578 --> 00:23:08.733
in the same journal,
by Oppenheim,

00:23:08.733 --> 00:23:12.326
"On the Relationship of
Heat of Combustion with the

00:23:12.326 --> 00:23:14.415
Constitution of
Substances."

00:23:14.415 --> 00:23:15.200
Right?
 

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.558
So could you look at the
constitution?

00:23:16.558 --> 00:23:18.680
He didn't mean it yet,
constitution.

00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.259
Notice this is 1868;
still pretty early days.

00:23:21.259 --> 00:23:24.521
He didn't mean constitution to
mean nature and sequence of

00:23:24.521 --> 00:23:24.980
bonds.
 

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.598
He just meant what was in there.
 

00:23:26.598 --> 00:23:29.108
Okay, so how did they try to do
this?

00:23:29.108 --> 00:23:31.588
Could we do it,
the way they did it,

00:23:31.588 --> 00:23:34.200
by predicting the heat of
combustion,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.118
how much heat you get out of
burning a thing,

00:23:36.118 --> 00:23:38.960
say just by how much carbon and
hydrogen?

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.568
We know you can burn carbon,
coal, and get a certain amount

00:23:41.568 --> 00:23:42.200
of heat out.
 

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:45.538
We know you can burn hydrogen
gas and get a certain amount of

00:23:45.538 --> 00:23:46.150
heat out.
 

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:49.661
Could you take a substance,
know how much carbon and how

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:52.726
much hydrogen is in it,
and predict how much heat

00:23:52.726 --> 00:23:54.577
you'll get out of burning it?
 

00:23:54.577 --> 00:23:55.279
Right?
 

00:23:55.279 --> 00:23:57.255
It would be great if that were
true.

00:23:57.255 --> 00:23:57.650
Okay?
 

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:59.308
So let's see how well it works.
 

00:23:59.308 --> 00:24:03.876
So you're going to compare,
to graphite -- that's carbon --

00:24:03.876 --> 00:24:04.901
and hydrogen.
 

00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:05.608
Right?
 

00:24:05.608 --> 00:24:09.413
So we'd have a certain number
of atoms per mole,

00:24:09.413 --> 00:24:13.217
and then we know what the heat
of combustion is,

00:24:13.217 --> 00:24:14.269
per mole.
 

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:18.869
You get 94r kilocalories out of
burning a mole of graphite,

00:24:18.869 --> 00:24:21.328
a mole of carbon in graphite.
 

00:24:21.328 --> 00:24:26.738
You get 57.8 out of burning
hydrogen.

00:24:26.738 --> 00:24:27.788
Okay?
 

00:24:27.788 --> 00:24:31.066
That's per -- I'm not sure,
we'll have to see,

00:24:31.066 --> 00:24:34.049
I think that's per atom,
not per molecule;

00:24:34.049 --> 00:24:35.069
we'll see.
 

00:24:35.069 --> 00:24:37.190
Yeah, no, it's per H_2. Okay.
 

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:43.275
So it's 94.05 per carbon,
and 57.8 per H_2.

00:24:43.275 --> 00:24:44.288
Okay?
 

00:24:44.288 --> 00:24:49.096
Now you take some other
substance, like ethene,

00:24:49.096 --> 00:24:49.828
C_2H_4.
 

00:24:49.828 --> 00:24:50.769
Right?
 

00:24:50.769 --> 00:24:55.278
So you should get two times
94.05, for the carbon,

00:24:55.278 --> 00:24:59.349
and two times 57.8;
because it's 57.8 for every two

00:24:59.349 --> 00:25:00.109
hydrogens.
 

00:25:00.109 --> 00:25:01.559
You've got four hydrogens.
 

00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:02.690
So two times that.
 

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:08.469
So you should get 303.7 out of
burning a mole of ethene.

00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:09.309
Right?
 

00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:12.450
In fact, you get 316. Right?
 

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.190
Which isn't bad.
 

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:16.846
It's an error of 12
kilocalories/mol,

00:25:16.846 --> 00:25:18.980
but that's only 4%.
 

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.359
So you're pretty close already
in predicting that.

00:25:22.359 --> 00:25:24.640
Now so we can be optimistic.
 

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.210
Well let's try something else.
 

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:31.758
Notice, we could even
understand why you get a little

00:25:31.758 --> 00:25:38.054
more heat out than you expected,
because one of the bonds in

00:25:38.054 --> 00:25:41.469
C_2H_4 is not such a strong
bond.

00:25:41.469 --> 00:25:42.750
Right?
 

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.490
The second bond of the double
bond isn't so strong.

00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:49.186
So you expect the starting
material not to be as stable as

00:25:49.186 --> 00:25:50.548
it might have been.
 

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:53.181
It's a little higher in energy
than it would've been if that

00:25:53.181 --> 00:25:54.519
second bond was really good.
 

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:57.186
So when you burn it,
you get more heat out,

00:25:57.186 --> 00:25:59.854
because there was more in it to
begin with.

00:25:59.854 --> 00:26:00.490
Right?
 

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.769
It was less stable to begin
with.

00:26:01.769 --> 00:26:03.058
So we can understand that.
 

00:26:03.058 --> 00:26:05.509
Now let's try to extend it to
other things.

00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:06.509
How about cyclohexane?
 

00:26:06.509 --> 00:26:09.539
There we have 6 carbons and 12
hydrogens.

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:11.150
You'd predict 911.
 

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:13.109
It turns out to be 881.
 

00:26:13.109 --> 00:26:14.858
It's off by 29.
 

00:26:14.858 --> 00:26:16.923
But that's only a 3% error.
 

00:26:16.923 --> 00:26:17.460
Right?
 

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.818
Not bad, we're doing well.
 

00:26:18.818 --> 00:26:21.598
Now how about cyclohexanol.
 

00:26:21.598 --> 00:26:22.318
Right?
 

00:26:22.318 --> 00:26:25.762
There again it has -- since it
has the same amount -- you don't

00:26:25.762 --> 00:26:28.761
expect to get anything out of
oxygen, because you don't

00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:30.094
oxidize oxygen -- right?
 

00:26:30.094 --> 00:26:31.150
-- in burning.
 

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:33.720
It's only the carbon and
hydrogen that you oxidize.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.500
So you predict exactly the
same, 911;

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.210
it's the same amount of
hydrogen and carbon.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:43.308
But you only get out 842,
instead of 881.

00:26:43.308 --> 00:26:46.983
So now you're off by 68
kilocalories/mol,

00:26:46.983 --> 00:26:47.720
or 8%.
 

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:51.731
And if you take sugar,
which is again C_6H_12,

00:26:51.731 --> 00:26:55.299
but O_6 now,
now you get out only 670.

00:26:55.299 --> 00:26:56.519
You're off by 240.
 

00:26:56.519 --> 00:26:58.890
So you're making a 36% error.
 

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.136
Now it's getting pretty bad.
 

00:27:01.136 --> 00:27:01.700
Right?
 

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:06.054
Does that surprise you,
that when there's oxygen in the

00:27:06.054 --> 00:27:09.200
molecule you get less out by
burning;

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.230
less heat out by burning,
when there's already oxygen

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:13.849
there?
 

00:27:13.849 --> 00:27:16.279
What is burning?
 

00:27:16.279 --> 00:27:18.589
Student:  Oxidation.
 

00:27:18.589 --> 00:27:19.990
Prof: What do you do?
 

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:21.088
Student:  Oxidation.
 

00:27:21.088 --> 00:27:21.950
Prof: You're oxidizing
it.

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:25.345
These are already partly
oxidized, if they have oxygen in

00:27:25.345 --> 00:27:25.769
them.
 

00:27:25.769 --> 00:27:27.808
So you've already gone partway.
 

00:27:27.808 --> 00:27:30.692
You don't expect to get so much
out anymore.

00:27:30.692 --> 00:27:31.230
Right?
 

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.289
Okay, so that makes sense.
 

00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:35.440
They're partially pre-oxidized.
 

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.858
So you make bigger -- you make
errors in this.

00:27:37.858 --> 00:27:40.727
So for fuel purposes,
for physiology,

00:27:40.727 --> 00:27:43.996
this isn't so bad;
especially if you could include

00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.914
some kind of correction for
every oxygen that's already

00:27:46.914 --> 00:27:48.700
there, partway to the product.
 

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.684
Then you'd get numbers that --
you know, within 5,

00:27:51.684 --> 00:27:53.940
maybe 10% -- are going to be
right.

00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.617
So you actually could add up
the -- just from the composition

00:27:57.617 --> 00:28:01.234
-- add up what atoms are there
and predict how much heat you

00:28:01.234 --> 00:28:02.644
can get out by burning.
 

00:28:02.644 --> 00:28:03.318
Right?
 

00:28:03.318 --> 00:28:08.630
Now, but might you need a more
complex model,

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.750
if what your goal is,
is to predict chemically useful

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:14.298
energies,
rather than just ones that say

00:28:14.298 --> 00:28:17.955
how much energy you're going to
get by burning your chocolate

00:28:17.955 --> 00:28:18.931
bar or whatever?
 

00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:19.480
Okay?
 

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.599
For physiology purposes,
you might be content with plus

00:28:22.599 --> 00:28:23.410
or minus 5%.
 

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.717
But for predicting the
equilibrium constant between

00:28:26.717 --> 00:28:29.875
cyclohexane and cyclohexanol --
suppose there was some

00:28:29.875 --> 00:28:32.557
reaction, oxidation reaction,
where you can convert one to

00:28:32.557 --> 00:28:36.423
the other,
and you're going to be off by

00:28:36.423 --> 00:28:38.720
1% say,
which would be 9

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.150
kilocalories/mol.
 

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:42.200
So you're off by 1%.
 

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.440
How off would you be in the
equilibrium constant?

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:55.759
How big a factor in equilibrium
would nine kilocalories be?

00:28:55.759 --> 00:28:59.279
Do you remember how to do that?
 

00:28:59.279 --> 00:29:04.420
How do you go from energy to
equilibrium constant?

00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:07.544
I'm going to keep boring in on
this until you remember it,

00:29:07.544 --> 00:29:10.230
because it's certainly going to
be on the exam.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:11.210
Katherine?
 

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.630
Student:  Ten to the --
you do the three quarters.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.278
Prof: 10^3/4ths of that.
 

00:29:16.278 --> 00:29:19.873
Okay, so 3/4ths of nine is
about seven.

00:29:19.873 --> 00:29:20.630
Right?
 

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:25.821
So by what factor would you be
off in predicting an equilibrium

00:29:25.821 --> 00:29:30.009
constant, if you were off by 9
kilocalories/mol?

00:29:30.009 --> 00:29:33.039
Student:  10^-7th.
 

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:36.269
Prof: 10^7th. Right?
 

00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:40.420
Is that good enough,
to be off by ten-million-fold?

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.099
Not very good. Right?
 

00:29:43.099 --> 00:29:45.088
So you're off by 10^7th.
 

00:29:45.088 --> 00:29:48.568
So a useful model clearly has
to go, to get better numbers

00:29:48.568 --> 00:29:52.048
than you can get just from the
composition, just from what

00:29:52.048 --> 00:29:53.269
atoms are there.
 

00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:55.130
You're going to have to
consider bonds --

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.730
and that's what I said we were
going to do --

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.778
to see how good it can be if
you just have certain energies

00:29:59.778 --> 00:30:00.828
for certain bonds.
 

00:30:00.828 --> 00:30:03.328
So we need to go to
constitution.

00:30:03.328 --> 00:30:05.970
So now when we're going to talk
about energy,

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:09.509
there's going to be a big,
a really fundamental question.

00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:10.700
So here's cyclohexane.
 

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:12.099
It has a certain energy.
 

00:30:12.099 --> 00:30:14.538
What number should I put on it?
 

00:30:14.538 --> 00:30:20.038
Should I say it's 13,28,
562 million?

00:30:20.038 --> 00:30:21.259
Right?
 

00:30:21.259 --> 00:30:23.910
The question is one of our
fundamental questions.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:25.009
What's that?
 

00:30:25.009 --> 00:30:26.140
Students:
 Compared to what?

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.009
Prof: Compared to what?
 

00:30:27.009 --> 00:30:29.573
What are we going to call zero?
 

00:30:29.573 --> 00:30:30.068
Okay?
 

00:30:30.068 --> 00:30:33.099
Now for practical purposes of
doing an experiment,

00:30:33.099 --> 00:30:35.078
there's a very good reference.
 

00:30:35.078 --> 00:30:39.547
and it's the one we've just
been using, without saying so --

00:30:39.547 --> 00:30:43.220
which is CO_2 and H_2O;
the same amount of carbon in

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.017
CO_2 and the same amount of
hydrogen in H_2O.

00:30:46.017 --> 00:30:46.588
Right?
 

00:30:46.588 --> 00:30:50.130
Why is that a convenient
reference point to take,

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:52.859
from an experimental point of
view?

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:53.950
Lucas?
 

00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:55.430
Student:  Well that's
what you get in burning.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.086
Prof: Ah,
so all you have to do is burn

00:30:57.086 --> 00:30:58.450
it, see how much heat you get
out,

00:30:58.450 --> 00:31:01.900
and you know the energy
relative to CO_2 and H_2O.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:03.990
So that's called the heat of
combustion.

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.788
And it turns out to be 881.6
kilocalories/mol,

00:31:07.788 --> 00:31:09.308
for cyclohexane.
 

00:31:09.308 --> 00:31:11.609
We were just talking about
that.

00:31:11.609 --> 00:31:12.130
Okay?
 

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:14.700
Now so it's easily measured.
 

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:15.838
That's a good comparison.
 

00:31:15.838 --> 00:31:18.746
But if I hadn't told you that
we wanted an experimental

00:31:18.746 --> 00:31:21.730
comparison,
that we wanted sort of a

00:31:21.730 --> 00:31:25.078
simple-to-think-about comparison
--

00:31:25.078 --> 00:31:26.778
maybe if you couldn't even
measure it --

00:31:26.778 --> 00:31:29.088
what might you think of as a
point of comparison?

00:31:29.088 --> 00:31:32.155
If you're going to talk about
-- you got a whole bunch of

00:31:32.155 --> 00:31:34.949
different compounds,
you want to know how stable is,

00:31:34.949 --> 00:31:36.098
compared to what?
 

00:31:36.098 --> 00:31:37.430
What are we going to use as the
what?

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:38.618
Student: Unbonded atoms.
 

00:31:38.618 --> 00:31:41.828
Prof: One -- it could be
unbonded atoms.

00:31:41.828 --> 00:31:44.746
That would be a really good
one, because then when we start

00:31:44.746 --> 00:31:47.000
with atoms,
we put them together and make

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.547
bonds,
and if there's a certain energy

00:31:49.547 --> 00:31:52.381
for each bond,
then we would be comparing our

00:31:52.381 --> 00:31:54.429
molecule,
or our model of a molecule,

00:31:54.429 --> 00:31:56.490
with all these bonds,
to the atoms.

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:57.880
That'd be a very good one.
 

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.884
But that's going to be a very
hard one to deal with

00:32:00.884 --> 00:32:02.326
experimentally -- right?
 

00:32:02.326 --> 00:32:03.588
-- to go to atoms.
 

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:06.630
There's another thing that you
could actually have in a bottle,

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:08.640
that might make sense to
compare to,

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:13.140
and that would be the elements,
in their standard state.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.557
So graphite;
how stable is it compared to

00:32:16.557 --> 00:32:20.875
graphite being the carbon and
H_2 gas being the hydrogen?

00:32:20.875 --> 00:32:21.568
Right?
 

00:32:21.568 --> 00:32:25.194
So that, if you're comparing to
the elements in their standard

00:32:25.194 --> 00:32:28.403
states,
that difference -- notice that

00:32:28.403 --> 00:32:33.371
cyclohexane is just slightly
more stable than the elements

00:32:33.371 --> 00:32:35.288
bonded to one another.
 

00:32:35.288 --> 00:32:36.160
Right?
 

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.349
And that's called the
"heat of formation".

00:32:38.349 --> 00:32:40.730
That's just a definition;
that's what the heat of

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.259
formation is.
 

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:45.209
It's the energy compared to the
elements in their standard

00:32:45.209 --> 00:32:45.625
state.
 

00:32:45.625 --> 00:32:46.180
Okay?
 

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.440
Now, but how could you measure
that experimentally?

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.608
How would you get heat of
formation?

00:32:51.608 --> 00:32:56.521
You know the energy of
cyclohexane relative to CO_2 and

00:32:56.521 --> 00:32:59.068
H_2O, by doing combustion.
 

00:32:59.068 --> 00:33:02.910
How would you know it relative
to graphite and hydrogen?

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:05.742
You can't mix hydrogen and
graphite and have it suddenly

00:33:05.742 --> 00:33:08.833
magically become cyclohexane and
measure the heat involved in

00:33:08.833 --> 00:33:10.068
that transformation.
 

00:33:10.068 --> 00:33:12.494
But how could you get it?
 

00:33:12.494 --> 00:33:13.660
Do you see?
 

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.920
Student: 
&gt;.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.048
Prof: There's a neat
trick to use.

00:33:17.048 --> 00:33:19.190
Student: Burning
graphite and hydrogen.

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.243
Prof: Ah,
you could burn the graphite and

00:33:22.243 --> 00:33:24.845
the hydrogen,
see how much heat they give

00:33:24.845 --> 00:33:26.990
off, and then take the
difference.

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.769
Right?
 

00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:28.598
So that's what you do.
 

00:33:28.598 --> 00:33:33.625
You burn that and get 911.1,
and the difference then,

00:33:33.625 --> 00:33:37.972
29.5, is the heat of formation
of cyclohexane,

00:33:37.972 --> 00:33:40.099
from the elements.
 

00:33:40.099 --> 00:33:41.288
Well done.
 

00:33:41.288 --> 00:33:45.920
Okay, but Andrew says it would
be great,

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.963
for purposes of -- oh and in
fact these heats of formation

00:33:48.963 --> 00:33:52.009
are available in tables for lots
and lots of compounds.

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:53.150
And this brings up a question.
 

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:57.184
This table is taken -- and
there are several others here

00:33:57.184 --> 00:34:00.340
for alkanes, cycloalkanes,
alkenes, alkynes,

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:03.349
aromatic hydrocarbons and
everything.

00:34:03.349 --> 00:34:04.259
You can look these up.
 

00:34:04.259 --> 00:34:07.352
You can find them on the Web
too, all these heats of

00:34:07.352 --> 00:34:08.079
formation.
 

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:10.920
So it's how stable a particular
substance is.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:13.320
And it's not just molecules.
 

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:17.648
Notice they also have atoms and
radicals, inorganic compounds,

00:34:17.648 --> 00:34:20.690
cations, and anions;
all of them relative to the

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:21.239
elements.
 

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.840
So you can find tables like
this.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.943
These particular tables I took
from a book by Streitwieser,

00:34:25.943 --> 00:34:28.565
Heathcock and Kosower,
which we've often used as a

00:34:28.565 --> 00:34:30.010
textbook in the course.
 

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:32.746
I think it might be out of
print now, though the publisher

00:34:32.746 --> 00:34:34.139
may still have some copies.
 

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:37.137
But would you like to have a
textbook for second semester,

00:34:37.137 --> 00:34:39.820
so we don't have to continue
with the Wiki stuff?

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.539
Students:  Yes.
 

00:34:40.539 --> 00:34:42.929
Prof: Now,
so if we're going to do that,

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:44.539
we have to make the decision.
 

00:34:44.539 --> 00:34:48.018
Are we going to get a slick,
new book, that has a lot of

00:34:48.018 --> 00:34:52.130
nice color pictures in it and so
on, and the very latest thing?

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:54.615
Or are we going to get
something like Streitwieser and

00:34:54.615 --> 00:34:55.179
Heathcock?
 

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:58.032
Which I think is a wonderful
book, but you're going to have

00:34:58.032 --> 00:35:00.539
find secondhand copies,
or maybe the publisher still

00:35:00.539 --> 00:35:01.719
has a few and so on.
 

00:35:01.719 --> 00:35:04.563
These new books,
they charge an absolute arm and

00:35:04.563 --> 00:35:07.530
a leg for them,
as you probably have found out.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.239
So I want to do it however you
want to do it.

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:12.710
Actually, why don't you think
about it a little bit?

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.152
I like this book,
but there are plenty of other

00:35:15.152 --> 00:35:17.489
books that are just fine for our
purposes.

00:35:17.489 --> 00:35:20.175
And we won't be 100% in the
book, you won't be surprised to

00:35:20.175 --> 00:35:20.500
hear.
 

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.498
But there'll be a lot of stuff
that could be useful in having a

00:35:23.498 --> 00:35:24.030
textbook.
 

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:25.050
Chenyu?
 

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:28.007
Student:  Could you tell
us the level of clarity or

00:35:28.007 --> 00:35:29.563
quality in instruction,
clarity

00:35:29.563 --> 00:35:31.119
&gt;.
 

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:32.610
Prof: It's not going to
make a lot of difference.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.460
In fact, we could probably get
one of these,

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.440
you know, outlines of organic
chemistry,

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.083
little paperback books and so
on, that would probably have the

00:35:42.083 --> 00:35:43.159
stuff we wanted.
 

00:35:43.159 --> 00:35:45.842
But then you probably couldn't
hold your head up against your

00:35:45.842 --> 00:35:48.166
roommates, and so on,
if you have a little dinky book

00:35:48.166 --> 00:35:48.612
like that.
 

00:35:48.612 --> 00:35:49.909
&gt;
 

00:35:49.909 --> 00:35:56.052
When I took organic chemistry,
the professor was Professor

00:35:56.052 --> 00:35:58.525
Fieser,
who wrote lots and lots of

00:35:58.525 --> 00:36:00.844
textbooks,
and he had just written one for

00:36:00.844 --> 00:36:03.210
nurses,
for a one-semester course.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.543
So we took two semesters and
used a book that was about that

00:36:05.543 --> 00:36:05.860
thick.
 

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.592
It was -- I wasn't too
embarrassed, I didn't know

00:36:08.592 --> 00:36:10.869
enough to be embarrassed at that
time.

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:12.090
And it was a good book.
 

00:36:12.090 --> 00:36:13.300
I don't have it anymore.
 

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.257
Somebody borrowed it from me
and didn't give it back.

00:36:15.257 --> 00:36:16.050
It was a neat book.
 

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:21.090
But anyhow, we can talk about
this a little more next time.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.103
But think over whether you want
to fork out for a shiny new

00:36:24.103 --> 00:36:25.898
book,
or would rather have a book,

00:36:25.898 --> 00:36:27.670
which I think is equal in
quality,

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:30.434
maybe better even,
that you'd have to go buy

00:36:30.434 --> 00:36:33.590
secondhand copies or something,
but it'd save you some money.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.507
So think about it,
and we'll talk about it next

00:36:35.507 --> 00:36:35.800
time.
 

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.670
Okay, and anyhow,
that's where I got this table.

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:43.201
Now, let's look at the heat of
formation, from this book,

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:44.980
of cycloalkanes.
 

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:50.081
And so cycloalkanes are CH_2
groups in a ring.

00:36:50.081 --> 00:36:50.989
Right?
 

00:36:50.989 --> 00:36:53.510
Six CH_2 groups is cyclohexane.
 

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:58.981
Two CH_2 groups is cycloethane,
or ethylene.

00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:00.000
Right?
 

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.809
So now here's the heat of
formation there;

00:37:03.809 --> 00:37:06.418
how big the ring is -- two
carbons, 3 carbons,

00:37:06.418 --> 00:37:09.840
4 carbons and so on -- and what
the heat of formation is.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.380
Now let's try to make sense out
of this.

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:15.735
We could look at the heat of
formation, divided by how many

00:37:15.735 --> 00:37:18.889
carbon or CH_2 units there are
in there.

00:37:18.889 --> 00:37:21.000
It could be they'd all be the
same.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.646
That would be the simplest
thing, if all we had to do is

00:37:23.646 --> 00:37:25.860
take how many CH_2 groups there
were there,

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:28.534
add that up,
and we would get what the

00:37:28.534 --> 00:37:29.619
stability is.
 

00:37:29.619 --> 00:37:36.510
And it's -- they're not too bad.
 

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:40.157
But again, compared to what?
 

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:41.070
Right?
 

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:44.132
So you're going to be -- the
biggest error is 6,

00:37:44.132 --> 00:37:47.001
that I see there,
and a more typical error is

00:37:47.001 --> 00:37:49.610
about 4 say, or something like
that.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:53.804
So 4 -- that would be,
if you were off by 4

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:58.800
kilocalories/mol -- ah,
but it's per CH_2 group.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.530
Ah, so it gets worse, right?
 

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.480
If you have a lot of CH_2
groups, there's a lot of energy.

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:07.820
So if it were only CH_2 group,
you'd off only by a factor of

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.396
1000, if you had that kind of
error.

00:38:10.396 --> 00:38:11.059
Okay?
 

00:38:11.059 --> 00:38:13.077
Well wait a second.
 

00:38:13.077 --> 00:38:15.309
This isn't an error.
 

00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:18.858
This is just what it is per
group.

00:38:18.858 --> 00:38:19.719
Right?
 

00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:22.199
So it's -- well let's go one
step further here.

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:24.849
The minimum is 4.9.
 

00:38:24.849 --> 00:38:26.867
That's for cyclohexane,
our old favorite,

00:38:26.867 --> 00:38:29.440
which isn't strained,
remember, or at least not very

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.510
strained, at least chair
cyclohexane.

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:35.139
Okay, so let's suppose that
that's the standard,

00:38:35.139 --> 00:38:39.349
and everything else is a little
bit higher in energy,

00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:42.143
more positive,
because there's some kind of

00:38:42.143 --> 00:38:43.007
strain there.
 

00:38:43.007 --> 00:38:43.539
Okay?
 

00:38:43.539 --> 00:38:44.760
How big is that strain?
 

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.760
Well let's compare what it
would be.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:51.300
So we'll call that -- you'd get
-- well say you'll get 4.9

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.126
reduced, compared to the
elements, if you have an

00:38:55.126 --> 00:38:56.719
unstrained ring.
 

00:38:56.719 --> 00:38:59.760
And now we're going to look at
the others and see how strained

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:00.309
they are.
 

00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:03.730
Now notice, down at the bottom
here, 13,14, 15,16,

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:07.500
these big rings have almost
exactly the same energy.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.719
So they're not strained. Right?
 

00:39:09.719 --> 00:39:13.742
We would get a very good
prediction of what their heat of

00:39:13.742 --> 00:39:17.909
formation is if we just multiply
from the value we got from

00:39:17.909 --> 00:39:19.059
cyclohexane.
 

00:39:19.059 --> 00:39:21.159
But the others here are a
little bit off.

00:39:21.159 --> 00:39:26.393
So strainless theory is
n times -4.9 predicts our

00:39:26.393 --> 00:39:27.059
heat.
 

00:39:27.059 --> 00:39:29.844
So you see that we have a
strain energy,

00:39:29.844 --> 00:39:32.844
which is the experiment,
that column shown,

00:39:32.844 --> 00:39:37.889
versus theory;
the n times 4.9.

00:39:37.889 --> 00:39:40.440
And here are the strain
energies you see.

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.846
Note, almost no strain energy
down at the bottom,

00:39:42.846 --> 00:39:44.349
just a few kilocalories/mol.
 

00:39:44.349 --> 00:39:45.900
That's not going to hurt us
very much.

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.192
But up at the top we have
strain -- the first one is bad,

00:39:49.192 --> 00:39:51.956
ethylene, we know,
because the double bond isn't

00:39:51.956 --> 00:39:52.780
so strong.
 

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:53.900
Okay, that's fine.
 

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:56.654
But then we have all single
bonds, but small ring strain,

00:39:56.654 --> 00:39:58.769
because you don't have such
good overlap.

00:39:58.769 --> 00:40:00.070
And we talked about that.
 

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:04.760
Okay, so 6 to 27 kilocalories
of strain there.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.210
We already understand why that
is.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:07.829
But here's an interesting one.
 

00:40:07.829 --> 00:40:13.018
These ones, which are bigger
than 6 -- right?

00:40:13.018 --> 00:40:17.389
-- bigger than 6 members in the
ring, but they have strain,

00:40:17.389 --> 00:40:20.253
and that strain is called
transannular,

00:40:20.253 --> 00:40:21.760
across the ring.
 

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.880
And you can easily see why it
is.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:28.085
There's a view of a model of
cyclohexane, at the top,

00:40:28.085 --> 00:40:30.268
and below is cyclooctane.
 

00:40:30.268 --> 00:40:34.003
Now of course you'd -- Baeyer
thought it would be strained

00:40:34.003 --> 00:40:36.820
because you'd have to bend the
bonds out.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.760
But Sachse said you don't have
to bend the bonds out,

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.514
all you have to do is pucker
it.

00:40:41.514 --> 00:40:42.079
Right?
 

00:40:42.079 --> 00:40:45.914
But if you start puckering too
much, opposite sides will run

00:40:45.914 --> 00:40:47.150
into one another.
 

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:50.199
And you can really see this if
you look at space-filling models

00:40:50.199 --> 00:40:50.739
of these.
 

00:40:50.739 --> 00:40:54.474
Here, the repulsion between
those two that are across the

00:40:54.474 --> 00:40:58.809
ring, you can see the hydrogens
really crunch into one another.

00:40:58.809 --> 00:41:03.076
So these intermediate sized
rings suffer from transannular

00:41:03.076 --> 00:41:03.750
strain.
 

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:06.780
So you can see this by
comparing heats of formation.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.400
Which remember -- how do you --
what experiment do you do to

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.179
measure heats of formation?
 

00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:14.530
What actually would you do when
you went into lab?

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:17.309
You have these substances.
 

00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:19.538
What do you do with them in
lab, in order to measure their

00:41:19.538 --> 00:41:20.320
heat of formation?
 

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:22.429
Student: Calorimetry.
 

00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:23.034
Prof: You'd burn them.
 

00:41:23.034 --> 00:41:23.179
Right?
 

00:41:23.179 --> 00:41:26.835
What you actually measure is
the heat of combustion,

00:41:26.835 --> 00:41:27.409
right?
 

00:41:27.409 --> 00:41:30.793
But then if you also know -- if
somebody out there has for you

00:41:30.793 --> 00:41:33.400
measured the heat of combustion
of graphite,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:35.449
and the heat of combustion of
hydrogen,

00:41:35.449 --> 00:41:38.952
then you have the numbers that
enable you to work up your data

00:41:38.952 --> 00:41:42.454
and find out what the heat of
formation of your substance was.

00:41:42.454 --> 00:41:43.030
Right?
 

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:47.784
So now this book,
in Appendix III of this book,

00:41:47.784 --> 00:41:50.679
has average bond energies.
 

00:41:50.679 --> 00:41:52.523
And this is what Andrew wanted.
 

00:41:52.523 --> 00:41:52.940
Right?
 

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.054
He wanted to be able to start
with the atoms,

00:41:55.054 --> 00:41:57.119
add up all the bonds,
and get the energy.

00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:59.570
And, in fact,
here is a table that purports

00:41:59.570 --> 00:42:01.684
to do that;
that says that these are

00:42:01.684 --> 00:42:04.961
energies you can add up to get
what the heat of atomization

00:42:04.961 --> 00:42:05.639
would be.
 

00:42:05.639 --> 00:42:09.244
And you'll notice that it makes
a little distinction among

00:42:09.244 --> 00:42:12.153
carbon-carbon bonds,
gives different values for

00:42:12.153 --> 00:42:15.000
double and triple bonds,
than for single.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.119
That's certainly sensible.
 

00:42:16.119 --> 00:42:17.969
And the same for nitrogen.
 

00:42:17.969 --> 00:42:20.070
So the question is,
does this work?

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:23.619
Can one sum up bond energies to
get useful heats of atomization?

00:42:23.619 --> 00:42:26.849
So how well can bond energies
predict the heat of atomization,

00:42:26.849 --> 00:42:29.550
and where does the heat of
atomization come from?

00:42:29.550 --> 00:42:32.335
So again you're going to do
these heats of combustion,

00:42:32.335 --> 00:42:35.228
but you're going to need
somebody to measure a new value

00:42:35.228 --> 00:42:37.565
for you;
not just the heat of combustion

00:42:37.565 --> 00:42:40.650
of graphite and the heat of
combustion of hydrogen gas.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:42.768
And you'll see what you need
here.

00:42:42.768 --> 00:42:44.619
Because we're going to now
compare,

00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:47.577
not with graphite and hydrogen
-- which is something you can

00:42:47.577 --> 00:42:50.135
have in a bottle --
but we're going to compare with

00:42:50.135 --> 00:42:51.862
the atoms,
which you can't have in a

00:42:51.862 --> 00:42:52.230
bottle.
 

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:55.849
Now how are we going to measure
the heat of atomization?

00:42:55.849 --> 00:43:01.563
We're going to do it
indirectly, by this line.

00:43:01.563 --> 00:43:02.579
Right?
 

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:04.581
We know the heat of combustion
of our substance,

00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:05.389
or we measure it.
 

00:43:05.389 --> 00:43:08.219
We know the heat of combustion
of graphite and hydrogen.

00:43:08.219 --> 00:43:13.199
So all we need to know is the
heat of atomization of graphite.

00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:17.630
How hard is it to get a carbon
atom out of graphite,

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.409
or a hydrogen atom out of H_2?
 

00:43:20.409 --> 00:43:24.947
If we knew that,
then we could figure out that

00:43:24.947 --> 00:43:28.780
that's going to be
kilocalories/mol;

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.983
that's to get out six carbons
from graphite and twelve

00:43:32.983 --> 00:43:37.264
hydrogens from H_2 gas,
in order to make the C_6H_12 of

00:43:37.264 --> 00:43:38.217
cyclohexane.
 

00:43:38.217 --> 00:43:39.090
Right?
 

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:42.989
So if you knew that number,
the , the heat of atomization

00:43:42.989 --> 00:43:46.425
of graphite and hydrogen,
then you could add all those

00:43:46.425 --> 00:43:48.860
together,
with the proper sign,

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.916
and get that it's ,
the heat of atomization of

00:43:51.916 --> 00:43:52.518
cyclohexane.
 

00:43:52.518 --> 00:43:56.425
And then you could try to
parlay that into what the bond

00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:58.699
strengths are,
in cyclohexane.

00:43:58.699 --> 00:44:02.594
So what you need is the heat of
atomization of graphite and the

00:44:02.594 --> 00:44:04.730
heat of atomization of hydrogen.
 

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:08.159
But how can you know the heat
of formation for an atom?

00:44:08.159 --> 00:44:11.639
You do it by spectroscopy.
 

00:44:11.639 --> 00:44:14.980
So we've seen things like this
before, a Morse-type curve.

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:19.311
And we know that you have an
X-Y diatomic down in the bottom

00:44:19.311 --> 00:44:19.900
there.
 

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:23.547
And if you -- it takes a
certain amount of energy to get

00:44:23.547 --> 00:44:25.869
to X plus Y, to get to the
atoms.

00:44:25.869 --> 00:44:28.380
If you knew that energy -- and
that's what we want to know;

00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:30.320
how hard is it to break these
apart?

00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:32.480
H_2, for example,
into 2 H atoms?

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.429
But you notice that you could
do this with light,

00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:39.949
and if you knew what the
minimum amount of light is,

00:44:39.949 --> 00:44:44.083
to go up -- of course,
it's going to be quantized,

00:44:44.083 --> 00:44:44.760
right?
 

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.032
There are going to be given
levels, until you get to the

00:44:48.032 --> 00:44:49.760
level where it dissociates.
 

00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.548
And then, as you'll remember
from Erwin Meets

00:44:52.548 --> 00:44:55.219
Goldilocks,
it's not quantized anymore.

00:44:55.219 --> 00:44:56.989
You can have any energies you
want.

00:44:56.989 --> 00:45:02.083
So if by spectroscopy you can
see when it changes from being

00:45:02.083 --> 00:45:05.476
individual lines,
to being a continuum,

00:45:05.476 --> 00:45:09.920
where any energy goes,
then you know what that energy

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.260
is.
 

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.927
So you'd know how much energy
it takes to go from the molecule

00:45:13.927 --> 00:45:14.829
to the atoms.
 

00:45:14.829 --> 00:45:17.440
So you can do that by
spectroscopy.

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:22.469
And in the case of a hydrogen
molecule, it turns out to 104.2.

00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:25.409
But from that you get two
hydrogen atoms.

00:45:25.409 --> 00:45:28.934
So it's 52.1,
is the heat of formation from

00:45:28.934 --> 00:45:31.369
the gas of a hydrogen atom.
 

00:45:31.369 --> 00:45:34.690
So we know that;
because the heat of formation

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:37.130
of H_2 is defined as zero.
 

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:39.550
That's the element in its
standard state already.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:44.510
You can do the same thing with
oxygen and get that it's 59.6 to

00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:45.869
make an oxygen.
 

00:45:45.869 --> 00:45:47.768
But how do you do carbon?
 

00:45:47.768 --> 00:45:53.152
Because the standard state of
carbon is not C_2.

00:45:53.152 --> 00:45:54.070
Right?
 

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:57.938
And indeed you can't buy C_2 in
a bottle to do the experiment

00:45:57.938 --> 00:45:58.518
either.
 

00:45:58.518 --> 00:46:03.025
But what you can get in a
bottle is CO,

00:46:03.025 --> 00:46:05.159
carbon monoxide.
 

00:46:05.159 --> 00:46:10.523
So if you did the experiment on
CO, you'd find out that that

00:46:10.523 --> 00:46:12.159
number is 257.3.
 

00:46:12.159 --> 00:46:16.976
And now you have what you need;
because that's the difference

00:46:16.976 --> 00:46:20.239
between CO and a C atom plus an
O atom.

00:46:20.239 --> 00:46:24.773
But you know where CO is,
compared to graphite and

00:46:24.773 --> 00:46:27.690
oxygen,
by burning CO,

00:46:27.690 --> 00:46:33.849
and you know where oxygen is,
relative to oxygen in its

00:46:33.849 --> 00:46:36.873
standard state,
because we just did it with

00:46:36.873 --> 00:46:37.146
O_2.
 

00:46:37.146 --> 00:46:37.690
Right?
 

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:41.500
So there's burning graphite is
26.4.

00:46:41.500 --> 00:46:45.313
Graphite to a single oxygen
atom is that heat of formation

00:46:45.313 --> 00:46:46.719
of the oxygen atom.
 

00:46:46.719 --> 00:46:52.358
So all we need to have is that
difference, and we know what the

00:46:52.358 --> 00:46:55.360
heat of formation of carbon is.
 

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:59.409
It's going to be 171.3. Okay?
 

00:46:59.409 --> 00:47:02.659
So we're able to do it by doing
spectroscopy on CO.

00:47:02.659 --> 00:47:06.384
But this was done -- people got
the number 171.3,

00:47:06.384 --> 00:47:08.789
but then they began to worry.
 

00:47:08.789 --> 00:47:12.179
And there were two Nobel
Laureates,

00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:16.231
plus Edward Teller -- who was
big in the atomic energy

00:47:16.231 --> 00:47:21.527
community in the United States,
you may have heard of him -- so

00:47:21.527 --> 00:47:26.489
big time physicists who
absolutely disagreed with 171.3.

00:47:26.489 --> 00:47:30.860
Because what they said was that
the spectroscopy was misleading,

00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:35.199
that actually it was giving one
of --

00:47:35.199 --> 00:47:38.760
the light that was going in was
giving one of the atoms,

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:42.059
not in its normal state,
its low energy state,

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:43.289
but in a higher state.
 

00:47:43.289 --> 00:47:48.192
So the number that you
predicted, that you measured is

00:47:48.192 --> 00:47:53.371
171.3, was not to a normal
carbon atom, but to an excited

00:47:53.371 --> 00:47:54.481
carbon atom.
 

00:47:54.481 --> 00:47:55.500
Right?
 

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:58.342
So that the true energy of a
carbon atom would be lower than

00:47:58.342 --> 00:47:58.679
that.
 

00:47:58.679 --> 00:48:03.068
And so they thought -- one set
of them thought it would be 141

00:48:03.068 --> 00:48:06.523
kilocalories/mol,
and another thought it would be

00:48:06.523 --> 00:48:07.099
125.
 

00:48:07.099 --> 00:48:10.518
So these numbers are all very
precise.

00:48:10.518 --> 00:48:13.974
You can measure these positions
of spectral lines very

00:48:13.974 --> 00:48:17.429
accurately, but you don't know
how to interpret it.

00:48:17.429 --> 00:48:21.753
It could be way off,
by twenty or almost fifty

00:48:21.753 --> 00:48:23.579
kilocalories/mol.
 

00:48:23.579 --> 00:48:26.440
So you need some other way of
doing this.

00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.702
And for many years I've brought
in a guest lecturer to explain

00:48:30.702 --> 00:48:31.820
how he did it.
 

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.309
But unfortunately he died a
year and a half ago.

00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:37.817
So I'll have to tell you what
he would have told you,

00:48:37.817 --> 00:48:40.650
but we'll wait until next time
for that.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.960
Prof: The word
"apocalypse"

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.601
is the Greek word
apocalypsis that is

00:00:06.601 --> 00:00:08.751
translated as
"revelation"

00:00:08.751 --> 00:00:11.514
because that's exactly what it
means, "an

00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:13.050
uncovering."
 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.287
You will often hear the
Revelation of John also referred

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:21.370
to as The Apocalypse because
that's also its title.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.945
Now one point,
please don't call it "The

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:26.570
Revelations."
 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.316
I don't know why people think
that "Revelations"

00:00:29.316 --> 00:00:30.570
is the name of the book.
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.234
It's not, and it's the
"Revelation of John,"

00:00:33.234 --> 00:00:34.190
that's the title.
 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.383
The word just means "the
uncovering,"

00:00:36.383 --> 00:00:39.052
it refers nowadays in the
modern world to an entire genre

00:00:39.052 --> 00:00:40.960
of literature of the ancient
world,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.763
most of which is Jewish,
but there are some maybe Greek

00:00:44.763 --> 00:00:48.053
apocalypse,
things that people would call a

00:00:48.053 --> 00:00:52.511
Greek apocalypse or apocalyptic
type literature in some Latin

00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:56.970
texts or in Egyptian or in other
near eastern situations.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.143
Most of what we call
apocalypses comes from either an

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.890
ancient Jewish or ancient
Christian milieu.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.900
This kind of literature has
several characteristics the

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.799
scholars have pointed out,
and I'll go over this very

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:09.468
briefly.
 

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:13.668
They tend to be pseudonymous,
and they are set deep in the

00:01:13.668 --> 00:01:16.688
past like we saw in the book of
Daniel.

00:01:16.688 --> 00:01:20.337
In fact, Daniel is where we get
a lot of our generic notions of

00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:21.750
what an apocalypse is.
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.286
The two apocalyptic,
most apocalyptic books in the

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:27.739
Bible are Daniel and Revelation.
 

00:01:27.739 --> 00:01:32.278
There's kind of an apocalyptic
world view that I'll talk about

00:01:32.278 --> 00:01:32.800
also.
 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.858
When we talk about apocalypse
we're talking about first that

00:01:35.858 --> 00:01:37.000
genre of literature.
 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.765
They're usually pseudonymous,
they're ascribed to some

00:01:39.765 --> 00:01:43.038
ancient hero,
so we have apocalypses that are

00:01:43.038 --> 00:01:46.156
titled after Enoch,
said to be by Enoch,

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:49.950
who lived way,
way, way back just after Adam.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.644
We have apocalypses attributed
to various other Old Testament

00:01:54.644 --> 00:01:56.959
characters,
so that the idea,

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.695
as we saw with Daniel,
is it's written at one time but

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:03.950
the author claims to be writing
centuries before.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.173
Like we saw in the case of
Daniel, they usually tell you

00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:09.460
what's going to happen in the
future.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.479
Of course it's actually in the
past for the writer,

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:15.217
all up until a certain point,
and then the end of the current

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.210
society or the end of the world
as we know it.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.550
It's not normally the end of
the world entirely.

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.476
Usually it is a destruction and
then a resettling or recreation

00:02:25.476 --> 00:02:26.870
of a physical world.
 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.688
It's just called in the Kingdom
of God or something like that.

00:02:29.688 --> 00:02:32.979
They usually have a
chronological span of time.

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:35.776
They have all kinds of images,
angels, demons,

00:02:35.776 --> 00:02:38.573
sometimes beasts,
sometimes monstrous kinds of

00:02:38.573 --> 00:02:42.240
beasts as you've seen also in
Revelation and in Daniel.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.389
They're usually constructed as
some kind of narrative.

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.449
The author will say something
like,

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.650
I was in a dream and I saw this
and then this angel grabbed me

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.535
and took me to this part of
heaven and to took me to the

00:02:53.535 --> 00:02:55.167
third heaven,
or the fifth heaven,

00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:57.191
or the 12th heaven,
and then I went down to the

00:02:57.191 --> 00:02:58.300
deep and saw the dead.
 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.985
Think Dante's Inferno
and the way that Dante is led

00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:05.090
around into the different parts
of the cosmos.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.810
And they have a cosmology.
 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.729
They usually have a storied
structure to the universe with

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.304
several different layers of
heavens and often several

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:18.340
different layers of underneath,
the different hells or Hades.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.788
That's the genre of an
apocalypse.

00:03:21.788 --> 00:03:26.180
There's also the world view of
apocalypticism we'll call it.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.128
Why we use this term is because
Paul,

00:03:30.128 --> 00:03:33.419
as far as we know it,
never wrote an apocalypse,

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.818
and yet his letters show strong
influence of apocalypticism,

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.889
that is an apocalyptic world
view.

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:42.375
You have, for example,
three different kinds of

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:42.970
dualisms.
 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.182
You've already seen in the
Gospel of John and other texts

00:03:46.182 --> 00:03:48.878
how there's a dualism between
good and evil,

00:03:48.878 --> 00:03:50.310
there are the good guys and the
bad guys,

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.324
there is God and there is
Satan, so there's an ethical

00:03:53.324 --> 00:03:54.349
kind of dualism.
 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.470
There's also a spatial dualism.
 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.818
There's a dualism of up there
and down here,

00:03:58.818 --> 00:04:02.221
and so you have things that go
on on the earth are simply

00:04:02.221 --> 00:04:05.438
shadows of what's going on
actually in the heavens.

00:04:05.438 --> 00:04:08.187
It's like every country,
according to Daniel,

00:04:08.187 --> 00:04:11.185
has its own prince,
by that he means some kind of

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:12.310
angelic being.
 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.521
The Prince of Persia refers in
Daniel to some huge angelic

00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:19.920
super human being who actually
rules Persia.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.596
The Prince of Judah,
the angel of Judah tends to be

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:27.788
Michael or some other angel that
you've probably heard of,

00:04:27.788 --> 00:04:29.040
like Raphael.
 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.298
Each of the nations has its own
angel so you can imagine sort of

00:04:33.298 --> 00:04:37.069
that Russia has its angel,
and so then America has its

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:41.293
angel, and if Russia and America
were to go to war this would be

00:04:41.293 --> 00:04:44.980
actually simply an earthly
shadow type reflection of the

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.870
true reality which would be
going on as the angel of Russia

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.290
was battling the angel of
America in heaven.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.800
So everything that goes on in
our cosmos is simply a mirror

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.079
image of these battles that are
going on the heavens.

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:03.199
So that's another dualism of
space.

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.439
Then there's of course a
dualism of time.

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.654
We've talked a lot about how
for Daniel, remember there is a

00:05:09.654 --> 00:05:12.800
dualism of before time and the
after time.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.540
There's a time that Daniel's
writing,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.115
which is up to this,
and then what will happen is

00:05:20.115 --> 00:05:23.656
some big cataclysm will happen,
and then, according to Daniel,

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:27.050
the Son of Man will come down,
battle against the bad evil

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.088
forces,
overthrow Antiochus the IV

00:05:29.088 --> 00:05:31.939
Epiphanes,
and set up the Kingdom of God.

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:35.382
You have the same kind of
structure of the time before and

00:05:35.382 --> 00:05:38.824
the time after in the New
Testament except it's squirrely,

00:05:38.824 --> 00:05:39.430
right?
 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.086
Because according,
say, to Paul,

00:05:42.086 --> 00:05:46.714
this is what's happened:
you have the now time which is

00:05:46.714 --> 00:05:49.839
still going on,
and then you have the future

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.709
time which has already started
impinging on the present.

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:55.932
The thing that marks the
beginning of the end time has

00:05:55.932 --> 00:05:58.790
been the cross and the
resurrection of Jesus.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.519
Jesus was raised--what do you
have when people are raised?

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:03.730
The end of the world.
 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.480
The dead are supposed to be
raised according to Jewish

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.819
mythology,
and this is something that

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.084
doesn't happen all the time,
and mainly it happens at the

00:06:09.084 --> 00:06:09.649
end of time.
 

00:06:09.649 --> 00:06:13.800
The early Christians were Jews
expecting an apocalyptic Kingdom

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.651
of God to happen,
and Jesus probably taught this

00:06:16.651 --> 00:06:19.120
sort of thing himself as an
apocalyptic prophet.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.452
But when Jesus was killed then
the whole thing seemed to go

00:06:22.452 --> 00:06:25.670
awry because the Messiah is not
supposed to be killed.

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:28.302
The followers of Jesus,
though, very quickly believed

00:06:28.302 --> 00:06:31.439
that they had seen him after he
died, so they believed they had

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:33.009
seen the resurrected Jesus.
 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:35.083
We're not going to talk about
what they actually saw or what

00:06:35.083 --> 00:06:35.470
happened.
 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.696
From a historical point of view
all we can say is that they

00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:41.199
believed they saw him raised
from the dead.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:44.389
And that meant they thought,
oh the end time must have

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:47.100
already started because he has
been raised.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.620
In other words,
remember how Paul talks about

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.000
Jesus as the "first fruits
of those who sleep."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.654
That just means that Jesus is
just the first apple on the tree

00:06:56.654 --> 00:06:59.711
in his resurrection,
and all the rest will be raised

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.449
when the final end comes.
 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:04.259
But for the early Christians
they believed the end had

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.600
already to in some sense started
with the resurrection of Jesus,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.819
so that's this end.
 

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.396
But then they also know the
full end hasn't come because we

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:13.220
don't see the Kingdom of God
around us.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.050
Those damn Romans are still in
charge.

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.100
The bad evil American
government is still running

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.341
things in the world,
so this must not be the Kingdom

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:23.040
of God.
 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.398
It may be the kingdom of Obama
but it's not yet the Kingdom of

00:07:25.398 --> 00:07:25.629
God.
 

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:29.668
The Christians expected Jesus
to come back down,

00:07:29.668 --> 00:07:31.560
to come from heaven.
 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:33.370
This was called the
parousia.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.920
We've already seen it in
several texts.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.687
In I Thessalonians,
for example,

00:07:36.687 --> 00:07:39.882
Paul talks about Jesus will
come and then we'll fly up in

00:07:39.882 --> 00:07:41.310
the air and meet him.
 

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.675
That's the parousia,
which is a Greek term that just

00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:45.632
means "presence"
or "coming,"

00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:48.038
and we'll refer to the time
when a king or the emperor would

00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:50.947
come to visit a city,
and all the people in the city,

00:07:50.947 --> 00:07:53.800
the important people would come
out of the city,

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.910
out of the gates,
to meet the king and give him

00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.930
gifts and the king would give
them gifts,

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.779
and they would all accompany
the king back into the city.

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:01.430
That's called a parousia.
 

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.069
It's a purely sort of political
civic kind of term.

00:08:04.069 --> 00:08:07.569
This is what early Christians
use to call the coming back of

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:09.410
Jesus in his parousia.
 

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.079
Christians lived,
according to Paul's theology,

00:08:12.079 --> 00:08:16.252
right in this middle time of an
overlap of the before and the

00:08:16.252 --> 00:08:18.634
after,
but that's still the before and

00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:20.730
after that you see of
apocalyticism.

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.910
It's still there.
 

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.079
All these different dualisms
are one of the characteristics,

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:28.319
and you can see these sorts of
things even in texts that aren't

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:31.384
themselves apocalypses,
but they show influences from

00:08:31.384 --> 00:08:34.735
this kind of world view and this
kind of narrative view of

00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:36.440
history and the cosmology.
 

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.356
Often apocalypses seem to have
served as a form of cultural

00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:42.460
resistance.
 

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:46.292
They make the most sense often
if you see them as being popular

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:49.878
among people who either are
oppressed by some more powerful

00:08:49.878 --> 00:08:53.340
entity or at least believed that
they are oppressed.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:55.190
They fear themselves to be
oppressed.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:57.515
For example,
it's a perfectly natural world

00:08:57.515 --> 00:08:59.105
view--
you can understand how the

00:08:59.105 --> 00:09:01.158
world view is,
if you believe you're an

00:09:01.158 --> 00:09:04.591
oppressed minority and you can't
really fight against the more

00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:05.658
powerful entity.
 

00:09:05.658 --> 00:09:08.725
There's no way these early
little Christians groups or even

00:09:08.725 --> 00:09:11.897
the nation of Israel could rebel
against the Roman Empire and

00:09:11.897 --> 00:09:12.320
win.
 

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.727
The idea is that,
well, we will resist them and

00:09:15.727 --> 00:09:20.397
eventually God will intervene in
history with his angels and his

00:09:20.397 --> 00:09:23.509
army and the divine armies will
come,

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:28.860
and we will fight alongside
them to overthrow the Greeks.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:31.815
The earliest apocalypses,
Daniel was talking about the

00:09:31.815 --> 00:09:34.379
Greeks and Syrians,
the Greco-Syrian Empire.

00:09:34.379 --> 00:09:36.859
So the Greeks were the first
oppressive power that people

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:38.629
thought they could overthrow
this way.

00:09:38.629 --> 00:09:41.056
Then of course the Romans
became the more oppressive power

00:09:41.056 --> 00:09:42.726
later,
so in Jesus' time and Paul's

00:09:42.726 --> 00:09:45.669
time it's the Romans who are the
enemy that will be overthrown.

00:09:45.669 --> 00:09:46.950
But that will all happen.
 

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:51.089
It's not always true that the
people who believe in these

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:55.599
kinds of apocalyptic ideas are
themselves in fact an oppressed

00:09:55.599 --> 00:09:56.558
minority.
 

00:09:56.558 --> 00:10:00.292
After all, Ronald Reagan was
the President of the United

00:10:00.292 --> 00:10:03.210
States, and he still believed
this stuff.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:05.950
He still believed that God was
going to come any day,

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.970
he thought it was going to
happen right then,

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.822
any day now,
and God was going to have a big

00:10:10.822 --> 00:10:11.418
battle.
 

00:10:11.418 --> 00:10:13.923
Israel would be involved in it
and all the different nations of

00:10:13.923 --> 00:10:16.224
the earth, and then God would
set up the Kingdom of God in

00:10:16.224 --> 00:10:16.788
Jerusalem.
 

00:10:16.788 --> 00:10:21.009
Reagan talked about this on the
phone with different Israeli

00:10:21.009 --> 00:10:22.870
politicians and leaders.
 

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.571
How does this make sense for
Ronald Reagan,

00:10:25.571 --> 00:10:29.365
the most powerful man in the
world, to have this apocalyptic

00:10:29.365 --> 00:10:30.330
world view?
 

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:34.227
Well Reagan spent a lot of his
life feeling like he was on the

00:10:34.227 --> 00:10:38.254
out and feeling like he was not
one of the liberal establishment

00:10:38.254 --> 00:10:41.129
of the east coast and this sort
of thing.

00:10:41.129 --> 00:10:44.096
It doesn't necessarily mean
that people who hold these views

00:10:44.096 --> 00:10:47.065
are themselves discriminated
against minorities or oppressed

00:10:47.065 --> 00:10:49.309
minorities,
but it usually means that they

00:10:49.309 --> 00:10:51.726
perceive themselves that way,
because, otherwise,

00:10:51.726 --> 00:10:54.601
if you really do have power you
just make the world like you

00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:55.428
want it to be.
 

00:10:55.428 --> 00:10:57.916
You overthrow somebody or you
wage a battle,

00:10:57.916 --> 00:10:59.998
and wage war,
and you fix the problem

00:10:59.998 --> 00:11:00.750
yourself.
 

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:05.076
It's when you don't have the
power politically or militarily

00:11:05.076 --> 00:11:09.403
to fix the problem that this
kind of world view becomes very

00:11:09.403 --> 00:11:14.000
persuasive to you,
very believable, plausible.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.519
That's what the Book of
Revelation is.

00:11:16.519 --> 00:11:19.070
In fact, we use the title of
Revelation,

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.736
the Apocalypse,
as the term for the whole genre

00:11:22.736 --> 00:11:26.846
and for the whole world,
and it comes basically from

00:11:26.846 --> 00:11:30.907
this book because it's the most
famous apocalypse of all,

00:11:30.907 --> 00:11:31.850
naturally.
 

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:34.432
The weird thing about
Revelation, though,

00:11:34.432 --> 00:11:36.500
is that it's not pseudonymous.
 

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.807
We don't--the book says it's
just written by a guy named

00:11:39.807 --> 00:11:40.230
John.
 

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.149
It's not the same John who was
the brother of Zebedee,

00:11:44.149 --> 00:11:46.744
it's not the same John--if
there was a John who wrote the

00:11:46.744 --> 00:11:48.690
Gospel of John and the letters
of John,

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.210
which we don't really know who
wrote them,

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.878
but whoever wrote Revelation is
not the same person who wrote

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:53.990
any of that literature.
 

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.558
The style is too different,
the theology is too different.

00:11:56.558 --> 00:11:58.269
It's just clearly not the same
person.

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:02.549
He doesn't claim to be any
famous John, he just claims to

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:06.984
be John, and so we call him
often John the Seer or John the

00:12:06.984 --> 00:12:09.658
prophet or something like that.
 

00:12:09.658 --> 00:12:13.668
He doesn't seem to hide who he
is, and, interestingly enough,

00:12:13.668 --> 00:12:16.542
he doesn't place the
composition of his book

00:12:16.542 --> 00:12:18.278
centuries in the past.
 

00:12:18.278 --> 00:12:20.850
He actually places it in his
own time.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:23.750
This is also tells you where he
thought he was.

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:27.605
He really believed that he was
right there and that the end had

00:12:27.605 --> 00:12:29.970
already begun in a sense with
Jesus.

00:12:29.970 --> 00:12:34.775
He doesn't feel the need to
pass back into the past and

00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:36.288
prophesy again.
 

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.782
He sees himself as a prophetic
figure like Daniel,

00:12:38.782 --> 00:12:41.835
but a prophetic figure not for
the future, he doesn't believe

00:12:41.835 --> 00:12:43.870
there's going to be any more
future.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.200
He believes that Jesus is
coming back right now,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.730
so he just places himself right
at the beginning.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:51.746
It's also a little bit unlike
some apocalypses because you

00:12:51.746 --> 00:12:54.975
have these seven letters in the
beginning of the book that are

00:12:54.975 --> 00:12:57.940
addressed to seven different
churches in Asia Minor.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:02.019
One of the interesting things
about all of Revelation is its

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:02.850
structure.
 

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:06.970
I talked about Hebrews last
week and I gave you an outline

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:11.162
to the letter to the Hebrews to
show you that it was a very

00:13:11.162 --> 00:13:13.620
elaborately structured sermon.
 

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.090
Hebrews was very well written.
 

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:18.269
It's some of the best Greek in
the New Testament.

00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:21.605
Revelation is interestingly
structured, and I'll show you

00:13:21.605 --> 00:13:24.345
why I say that,
but actually it's not very well

00:13:24.345 --> 00:13:25.058
written.
 

00:13:25.058 --> 00:13:28.052
The Greek is almost illiterate,
and scholars have wondered

00:13:28.052 --> 00:13:31.308
about this, is it just because
the writer of this didn't have a

00:13:31.308 --> 00:13:32.570
very good education?
 

00:13:32.570 --> 00:13:35.631
Or some people have even
suggested maybe he's

00:13:35.631 --> 00:13:40.017
intentionally writing in kind of
a weird way as sort of almost a

00:13:40.017 --> 00:13:43.080
form of protest against people
in power.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.667
There are different theories
about this, but it's not very

00:13:45.667 --> 00:13:47.710
good Greek, and it's not very
well written.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.182
But it does have a fairly
intricate and interesting

00:13:51.182 --> 00:13:54.517
structure, and I call this a
structure of cycles,

00:13:54.517 --> 00:13:55.558
the spiral.
 

00:13:55.558 --> 00:13:58.195
I've titled your outline
"a spiral outline of

00:13:58.195 --> 00:14:00.240
Revelation"
because the story--

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.840
a lot of people have read
Revelation--

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.054
well, let me also back up and
explain what's different this

00:14:05.054 --> 00:14:06.940
week from what we did last week.
 

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.735
Last week, if you recall,
I spent a lot of time talking

00:14:09.735 --> 00:14:12.529
about Hebrews and medieval
interpretation because I was

00:14:12.529 --> 00:14:14.860
trying to illustrate how the
historical,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:17.013
critical interpretation of
these texts that I'm teaching

00:14:17.013 --> 00:14:19.009
you in the semester is not the
only way to do it.

00:14:19.009 --> 00:14:21.528
There are other kinds of
allegorical, theological,

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:24.456
literary ways to read these
texts, and those are perfectly

00:14:24.456 --> 00:14:24.918
fine.
 

00:14:24.918 --> 00:14:27.245
Now, though,
I'm completely reverting back

00:14:27.245 --> 00:14:30.308
to the historical critical way
of reading this text.

00:14:30.308 --> 00:14:33.918
Partly because the way that so
many people in popular culture

00:14:33.918 --> 00:14:36.562
read Revelation,
especially very conservative

00:14:36.562 --> 00:14:39.269
Christians, is to read it about
our time.

00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:43.385
It's been read over and over
again to be about English wars

00:14:43.385 --> 00:14:47.212
or World War I or World War II,
or most recently in The Late

00:14:47.212 --> 00:14:49.538
Great Planet Earth and these
kinds of things,

00:14:49.538 --> 00:14:52.371
it's about the Soviet Union
versus the United States of

00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:54.265
America,
and everything that it talks

00:14:54.265 --> 00:14:56.618
about is referring to what's
going to happen in our

00:14:56.618 --> 00:14:57.230
lifetimes.
 

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.615
So the weird animals,
the locust type things that

00:14:59.615 --> 00:15:02.048
have the heads of men and fly
through the air,

00:15:02.048 --> 00:15:03.610
there are all kinds of modern
Christians that say,

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.580
oh those are helicopters.
 

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.394
The author didn't know what a
helicopter looked like in the

00:15:07.394 --> 00:15:10.210
ancient world so he just
described kind of what he saw,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:11.870
but we know now those are
helicopters,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.576
so he's actually describing a
big war that's going to break

00:15:14.576 --> 00:15:17.471
out around Israel and in Israel
when the whole world's going to

00:15:17.471 --> 00:15:19.620
come to this big cataclysmic
nuclear war,

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.928
and it's all talked about right
here in Revelation.

00:15:21.928 --> 00:15:23.899
Well, obviously I'm not going
to do that.

00:15:23.899 --> 00:15:26.721
What I'm going to show you is
how historians read this text

00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:29.350
precisely by putting it back in
its ancient context.

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:31.590
One of the things is,
if you notice,

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.110
the Book Revelation doesn't
give one strict timeline.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:40.554
In fact it seems to have cycles
of setting up some kind of weird

00:15:40.554 --> 00:15:43.115
crisis,
having all these terrible

00:15:43.115 --> 00:15:46.166
things happen,
and then have something that

00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:50.097
looks like a quasi resolution
and then starting the cycle

00:15:50.097 --> 00:15:50.730
again.
 

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:55.980
It ends up being a big
cataclysmic crash at the end of

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.659
the book,
so this is why I call this a

00:15:58.659 --> 00:16:01.960
spiral of cycles that are going
on in the Book of Revelation.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.860
First though look at just
chapters 6-8,

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.258
and I'm going to walk you
through this very rapidly

00:16:10.258 --> 00:16:14.607
because you can see something of
the structure of this book right

00:16:14.607 --> 00:16:15.220
here.
 

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:22.162
Now this is after you've had
the letters in the beginning of

00:16:22.162 --> 00:16:24.998
Revelation,
then you've had the throne room

00:16:24.998 --> 00:16:26.572
scene with God,
which we're going to talk about

00:16:26.572 --> 00:16:28.042
in a minute,
and all the songs that

00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:29.000
everybody's saying.
 

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.039
Let's just walk through first
structure here.

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.620
Then I saw the Lamb open one of
the seven seals,

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.304
and I heard one of the four
living creatures call out with a

00:16:42.304 --> 00:16:43.990
voice of thunder,
"Come!"

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.158
I looked and there was a white
horse.

00:16:46.158 --> 00:16:48.530
Its rider had a bow,
a crown was given to him,

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.850
and he came out conquering and
to conquer.

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.226
This is conquering,
and warfare is this first

00:16:54.226 --> 00:16:54.840
horse.
 

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:57.759
"When he opened the second
seal," --where is he going

00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:58.558
with the seals?
 

00:16:58.558 --> 00:17:01.380
-- Picture this now:
we've talked about how books

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.554
were composed in the ancient
world, and we talked about

00:17:04.554 --> 00:17:05.259
scrolls.
 

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:07.778
Things were in scrolls not in
books like this with all the

00:17:07.778 --> 00:17:09.368
different pages all sewn
together.

00:17:09.368 --> 00:17:13.615
What he's imagining seeing is
there's this huge scroll in the

00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:17.858
sky that this angel is holding
and doing different things.

00:17:17.858 --> 00:17:21.496
When you want to finish a
letter or a book you roll up the

00:17:21.496 --> 00:17:25.387
scroll, and then you put a wax
seal at the end of the roll and

00:17:25.387 --> 00:17:26.920
that seals the book.
 

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.711
So anybody who wants to read
that letter or that book the

00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:33.420
first time has to break that wax
seal.

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.923
The seals that he's talking
about are the wax seals on the

00:17:35.923 --> 00:17:36.318
scroll.
 

00:17:36.318 --> 00:17:39.132
You imagine that you've got
this scroll that has one seal

00:17:39.132 --> 00:17:42.046
and you can break that seal and
you can unroll the scroll a

00:17:42.046 --> 00:17:44.348
little bit,
but then you get another seal,

00:17:44.348 --> 00:17:47.548
so you undo that seal and you
can unroll it a little bit more,

00:17:47.548 --> 00:17:50.948
so he's gradually unrolling
this scroll that's going to have

00:17:50.948 --> 00:17:52.848
all these things pop out of it.
 

00:17:52.848 --> 00:17:55.432
There's this big huge scroll
that has horses and riders

00:17:55.432 --> 00:17:57.680
jumping out of it and flying
through the air.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.769
He opened the second seal.
 

00:17:59.769 --> 00:18:01.163
I heard the second living
creature call out,

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:01.778
"Come!"
 

00:18:01.778 --> 00:18:04.088
And out came another horse
bright red.

00:18:04.088 --> 00:18:06.413
Its writer was permitted to
take peace from the earth so

00:18:06.413 --> 00:18:08.992
that the people would slaughter
one another and he was given a

00:18:08.992 --> 00:18:09.670
great sword.
 

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:12.847
So the first seal releases this
horse that looks like Empire,

00:18:12.847 --> 00:18:14.650
the conquering of the
conqueror;

00:18:14.650 --> 00:18:16.470
the second is just general
warfare.

00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.970
When he opened the third seal,
I heard the third living

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:20.730
creature call out,
"Come!"

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:22.210
I looked and there was a black
horse.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.410
Its rider had a pair of scales
in his hand,

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.779
and I heard what seemed to be a
voice in the midst of the four

00:18:26.779 --> 00:18:29.307
living creatures saying,
"A quart of wheat for a

00:18:29.307 --> 00:18:32.210
day's pay and three quarts of
barley for a day's pay,

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:35.250
but do not damage the olive oil
and the wine."

00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:37.920
The third seal is what?
 

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.420
Famine and poverty.
 

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.101
When he opened the fourth seal
I heard the voice of the fourth

00:18:44.101 --> 00:18:46.078
living creature call out,
"Come!"

00:18:46.078 --> 00:18:48.380
And I looked and there was a
pale green horse.

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:51.680
Its rider's name was Death,
and Hades followed with him.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.569
They were given authority over
a fourth of the earth to kill

00:18:54.569 --> 00:18:56.431
with the sword,
famine, and pestilence,

00:18:56.431 --> 00:18:58.440
and by the wild animals of the
earth.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:01.509
So death is the fourth seal.
 

00:19:01.509 --> 00:19:04.396
"When I opened the fifth
seal I saw under the

00:19:04.396 --> 00:19:08.108
altar"--notice we're not
talking about horsemen anymore.

00:19:08.108 --> 00:19:10.670
You had four horsemen
representing four different

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.150
things.
 

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:13.817
The fifth seal has something
like a digression,

00:19:13.817 --> 00:19:16.950
the fifth seal is not another
horse like you expect.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.355
In other words,
you're given to expect that

00:19:18.355 --> 00:19:20.230
you're going to see another
horse that's going to be some

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.203
other catastrophe,
but you don't get that,

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:23.410
you have a digression.
 

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.608
Under the altar,
the souls of those who had been

00:19:25.608 --> 00:19:28.464
slaughtered for the word of God
and for the testimony they had

00:19:28.464 --> 00:19:30.107
given,
they cried out with a loud

00:19:30.107 --> 00:19:32.016
voice, "Sovereign Lord,
holy and true,

00:19:32.016 --> 00:19:34.573
how long will it be before you
judge and avenge our blood on

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.220
the inhabitants of the
earth?"

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.787
They were each given a white
robe and told to rest a little

00:19:38.787 --> 00:19:40.779
longer until the number would be
complete,

00:19:40.779 --> 00:19:42.761
both of their fellow slaves [it
says "slaves"

00:19:42.761 --> 00:19:44.876
actually in the Greek,
not "servants"]

00:19:44.876 --> 00:19:45.980
and of their brothers.
 

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:47.828
It doesn't say sisters.
 

00:19:47.828 --> 00:19:51.180
There's almost no women in this
text at all.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.788
It's all men,
virgin men who have never been

00:19:53.788 --> 00:19:55.548
polluted by touching women.
 

00:19:55.548 --> 00:19:57.630
It's not exactly a pro-woman
book.

00:19:57.630 --> 00:20:00.109
You might not get that idea if
you have an English translation

00:20:00.109 --> 00:20:02.508
that keeps putting sisters in
here, but there are no sisters

00:20:02.508 --> 00:20:03.200
in this book.
 

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:08.500
There's the whore of Babylon,
there's the mother bride,

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.838
and then there are
men."...

00:20:11.838 --> 00:20:13.385
your slaves,
you fellow brothers,

00:20:13.385 --> 00:20:15.948
who are soon to be killed as
they themselves have been

00:20:15.948 --> 00:20:16.769
killed."
 

00:20:16.769 --> 00:20:18.269
What's the fifth seal?
 

00:20:18.269 --> 00:20:20.685
Well it gives him a vision of
the altar of God,

00:20:20.685 --> 00:20:23.890
in the temple of God in heaven,
and there's this big altar.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.769
And under the altar are the
souls of all the followers of

00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:29.240
Jesus who have been martyred up
to this time,

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.509
and the souls of those people
who will be martyred.

00:20:31.509 --> 00:20:34.450
They're not punished,
they're saying how long,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:37.190
how long, and he says,
oh keep your pants on,

00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:39.779
here's a white robe,
just sit there and be nice

00:20:39.779 --> 00:20:41.940
under the altar,
we're going to take care of it

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.288
all very,
very soon.

00:20:43.288 --> 00:20:47.415
The fifth seal is actually a
digression that tells you,

00:20:47.415 --> 00:20:50.394
the audience,
that if you suffer in this

00:20:50.394 --> 00:20:54.140
present time it will be taken
care of by God.

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:56.806
You have these four building up
of terrible things,

00:20:56.806 --> 00:20:59.740
and the fifth is a digression
that gives you comfort.

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.078
But now we're going to get back.
 

00:21:01.078 --> 00:21:04.093
He opened the sixth seal,
I looked and I heard a great

00:21:04.093 --> 00:21:06.026
earthquake,
the sun became black as

00:21:06.026 --> 00:21:08.250
sackcloth, the full moon became
like blood,

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.739
the stars of the sky fell to
the earth as a fig tree drops

00:21:10.739 --> 00:21:12.528
its winter fruit when shaken by
a gale.

00:21:12.528 --> 00:21:15.420
The sky vanished like a scroll
rolling itself up.

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:18.753
Remember I talked about how the
sky in ancient cosmology isn't

00:21:18.753 --> 00:21:20.821
just air,
it's actually a firm thing,

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:23.647
it's like a big piece of
leather or something like that

00:21:23.647 --> 00:21:26.191
sits up there,
and there's water on the other

00:21:26.191 --> 00:21:28.380
side of it in most ancient
cosmologies,

00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:29.660
or something on the other side
of it.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.800
When he talks about seeing the
sky rolled up like a scroll he

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.318
means that quite literally.
 

00:21:34.318 --> 00:21:36.982
The sky goes jrrrjrrjrrrrjrrr
and rolls up,

00:21:36.982 --> 00:21:39.140
and you can see heaven above
it.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.210
So the sky vanishes like a
scroll.

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.358
Every mountain and island moved
from its place.

00:21:44.358 --> 00:21:46.365
Then the kings of the earth,
and the magnates and the

00:21:46.365 --> 00:21:47.915
generals,
and the rich and the powerful,

00:21:47.915 --> 00:21:49.103
and everyone,
slave and free,

00:21:49.103 --> 00:21:50.949
hid in the caves,
and among the rocks of the

00:21:50.949 --> 00:21:52.467
mountains,
calling to the mountains and

00:21:52.467 --> 00:21:53.702
rocks,
"Fall on us and hide us

00:21:53.702 --> 00:21:55.369
from the face of the one seated
on the throne,

00:21:55.369 --> 00:21:56.769
and from the wrath of the Lamb!
 

00:21:56.769 --> 00:21:58.094
For the great day of their
wrath has come,

00:21:58.094 --> 00:21:59.160
and who is able to stand?"
 

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.470
The sixth seal is all hell
breaks loose.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.470
The cosmos is coming down on
top of itself.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:09.593
He's created an increasing
level of anxiety and catastrophe

00:22:09.593 --> 00:22:15.068
with this, but that fifth seal
there's kind of a digression.

00:22:15.068 --> 00:22:16.808
"After this I saw four
angels..."

00:22:16.808 --> 00:22:19.353
Now you think,
oh man, if the sixth seal is

00:22:19.353 --> 00:22:22.259
like that you know one more seal
is coming up.

00:22:22.259 --> 00:22:24.799
What's the seventh seal going
to be?

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.380
Man, I'm eager to hear this!
 

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:30.176
Remember all this was read out
loud in the ancient world so

00:22:30.176 --> 00:22:31.880
you're hearing all this.
 

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.358
"I saw four angles
standing at the four corners of

00:22:33.358 --> 00:22:35.029
the earth, hurrying back the
four winds of the earth."

00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:37.980
Now you get a bunch of other
stuff, "I saw another angel

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.930
ascend, and I heard the number
of those were sealed."

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:44.605
Now you have all the followers
of Jesus are numbered into

00:22:44.605 --> 00:22:48.478
different tribes of 12,000 a
piece, and each of those tribes

00:22:48.478 --> 00:22:50.118
is sealed themselves.
 

00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:52.861
Isn't that interesting,
you have another use of the

00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:56.260
term seal but now this is a seal
that's put on the faces of all

00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.618
the people who are the true
followers,

00:22:58.618 --> 00:23:01.542
who are the true Israel,
twelve tribes like the twelve

00:23:01.542 --> 00:23:03.452
tribe--
the lost ten tribes and the

00:23:03.452 --> 00:23:04.920
other two tribes of Israel.
 

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.988
There's the reconstituting of
Israel now, and they're sealed,

00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:11.088
and the seal is a good thing.
 

00:23:11.088 --> 00:23:13.829
It means you won't be harmed if
you have this on you.

00:23:13.829 --> 00:23:16.088
That goes on all of chapter 7.
 

00:23:16.088 --> 00:23:19.298
You're thinking where is the
seventh seal?

00:23:19.298 --> 00:23:22.990
We had six, I know there's
another one coming,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:24.140
where is it?
 

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:27.609
You have to wait all the way
through chapter 7 wanting the

00:23:27.609 --> 00:23:30.348
seventh seal but you're not
getting it yet.

00:23:30.348 --> 00:23:32.970
In other words,
he's just stringing you along.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.375
But he's stringing you along in
a way that's kind of good

00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:38.200
because he's reassuring you.
 

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.048
You know the seventh seal is
coming,

00:23:40.048 --> 00:23:42.108
and you're just--you're pretty
sure it's going to be really,

00:23:42.108 --> 00:23:44.355
really, really,
really bad because the sixth

00:23:44.355 --> 00:23:44.930
seal was.
 

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.898
But before you get to the
seventh seal you have this

00:23:47.898 --> 00:23:50.868
sealing of you,
if you're a faithful follower

00:23:50.868 --> 00:23:53.490
of Jesus, with the reassurance
of a seal.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.952
And then you have some songs,
we're going to talk about some

00:23:55.952 --> 00:23:58.538
songs, but everybody comes in
and it's like a Broadway play.

00:23:58.538 --> 00:24:01.134
You have something happen,
and then the chorus all runs on

00:24:01.134 --> 00:24:03.544
stage and they do a little song,
blessed be the lamb,

00:24:03.544 --> 00:24:04.400
and the blah,
blah,

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.454
blah, halleluiah,
halleluiah, and then they run

00:24:06.454 --> 00:24:07.838
off and you have more action.
 

00:24:07.838 --> 00:24:10.928
That's the way the story is
structured, for interesting

00:24:10.928 --> 00:24:11.500
reasons.
 

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:14.243
We get to the end of chapter 7,
we're finally to this chapter,

00:24:14.243 --> 00:24:16.808
so you get to Chapter 8--of
course they're not numbered in

00:24:16.808 --> 00:24:17.798
the ancient world.
 

00:24:17.798 --> 00:24:21.415
But "When the Lamb opened
the seventh seal,"

00:24:21.415 --> 00:24:22.848
you ready for this?
 

00:24:22.848 --> 00:24:27.460
"there was silence in
heaven for a half an hour."

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:29.009
That's the seventh seal.
 

00:24:29.009 --> 00:24:31.160
What's going on?
 

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:38.084
The text builds up tension,
and you hear this read out

00:24:38.084 --> 00:24:40.788
loud,
and it keeps building up this

00:24:40.788 --> 00:24:43.438
tension,
but then the seventh seal is

00:24:43.438 --> 00:24:47.076
such a anticlimax:
silence in heaven for a half an

00:24:47.076 --> 00:24:47.670
hour.
 

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:50.746
Then it doesn't explain
anything about that,

00:24:50.746 --> 00:24:52.318
it just starts over.
 

00:24:52.318 --> 00:24:54.578
And then you have another cycle
a little bit later.

00:24:54.578 --> 00:24:57.269
"Another angel of the
golden censor came and stood by

00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:58.118
the altar."
 

00:24:58.118 --> 00:25:00.455
In other words,
what's you've got is something

00:25:00.455 --> 00:25:01.078
like this.
 

00:25:01.078 --> 00:25:05.076
You have these four
scrolls--the four seals which

00:25:05.076 --> 00:25:08.146
are terrible,
terrible, terrible awful

00:25:08.146 --> 00:25:12.490
things, and then you have the
fifth which is a digression,

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:15.217
and it's actually a good thing,
it's the telling of the souls

00:25:15.217 --> 00:25:16.982
who have been martyred,
don't worry,

00:25:16.982 --> 00:25:18.880
you'll be saved,
here's a white robe,

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.798
relax.
 

00:25:19.798 --> 00:25:24.038
Then you have the sixth seal
which is another worse thing

00:25:24.038 --> 00:25:26.068
than all of these,
it's really,

00:25:26.068 --> 00:25:27.390
really bad and its goes on
longer,

00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.509
and then you have this long
digression again,

00:25:30.509 --> 00:25:35.459
this is like the fifth seal,
it's a sealing of the followers

00:25:35.459 --> 00:25:37.640
of Jesus with salvation.
 

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.582
Then after that digression then
you have this seventh seal which

00:25:41.582 --> 00:25:43.710
is really kind of anticlimactic.
 

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:47.299
But it's not bad because,
you know, silence in heaven for

00:25:47.299 --> 00:25:48.390
a half an hour.
 

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:53.384
Look at your spiral outline now
because this kind of structure

00:25:53.384 --> 00:25:56.740
of having a cycle of
catastrophes that are

00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:01.570
interrupted every once in a
while by some kind of digression

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:05.009
that then ends with something
good,

00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:08.878
that's the way the whole book
is structured in three different

00:26:08.878 --> 00:26:09.450
cycles.
 

00:26:09.450 --> 00:26:11.521
For example,
I said in the fourth chapter of

00:26:11.521 --> 00:26:14.269
Revelation you have the big
heavenly throne room scene.

00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:16.396
Revelation 5,
you have the introduction of

00:26:16.396 --> 00:26:18.680
the scroll with seven seals and
the lamb,

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:21.630
and then you have the first
cycle of seven,

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:24.028
and that's what I just walked
you through just now.

00:26:24.028 --> 00:26:27.608
Then right after 8:1,
the silence in heaven,

00:26:27.608 --> 00:26:29.670
it starts again with a second
cycle,

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:32.146
and you have in 8:2
introduction of seven angels

00:26:32.146 --> 00:26:34.440
with seven trumpets,
and then again you have the

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.671
first, second,
third, and fourth trumpet which

00:26:36.671 --> 00:26:38.568
announce these kind of
catastrophes.

00:26:38.568 --> 00:26:41.773
And then you have an interlude
where this eagle comes through

00:26:41.773 --> 00:26:43.588
and announces woes on everybody.
 

00:26:43.588 --> 00:26:46.940
And then you have the fifth
trumpet in 9:1-12,

00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:51.170
and the sixth trumpet in 9:13,
and then you have chapter 10

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:55.181
which has another interlude
which is about the scroll of

00:26:55.181 --> 00:26:56.130
prophecy.
 

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:58.691
Chapter 11, you have the talk
about the temple,

00:26:58.691 --> 00:27:00.640
and he has to measure the
temple.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.788
And then in 11:14 you have the
end of the second woe.

00:27:05.788 --> 00:27:09.680
And finally in 11:15 you have
the seventh trumpet.

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.328
And what does the seventh
trumpet introduce?

00:27:11.328 --> 00:27:14.595
Praise in heaven,
sort of like that half hour of

00:27:14.595 --> 00:27:15.288
silence.
 

00:27:15.288 --> 00:27:17.808
Then you have a long interlude,
which is chapters 12,

00:27:17.808 --> 00:27:21.413
13, and 14 which is about
battles between the woman who's

00:27:21.413 --> 00:27:24.759
the mother of church or the
mother of the Savior,

00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:25.750
and the dragon.
 

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.868
Chapter 13 is about the dragon
and the beast.

00:27:27.868 --> 00:27:31.720
Chapter 14 is about the lamb,
the horned lamb which

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.880
represents Jesus who's a horned
lamb who is wounded.

00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.085
And then you have starting in
15:1, you have a third cycle of

00:27:40.085 --> 00:27:43.029
seven angels and seven plagues
or bowls.

00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:46.103
Then you have the great
conclusion, which is the very

00:27:46.103 --> 00:27:49.000
end, the destruction of Rome in
chapters 17-19.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.368
The final battle which is
19:11-21,

00:27:52.368 --> 00:27:55.868
the imprisonment and eventual
destruction of enemies which is

00:27:55.868 --> 00:27:59.603
Chapter 20 and the establishment
of the new Jerusalem in chapters

00:27:59.603 --> 00:28:00.420
21 and 22.
 

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.318
What does this structure tell
us?

00:28:02.318 --> 00:28:06.066
Because the structures in these
different cycles,

00:28:06.066 --> 00:28:10.046
it builds up crisis and then it
gives you something,

00:28:10.046 --> 00:28:11.920
a relief at the end.
 

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:15.405
There's a famous New Testament
scholar who teaches at the

00:28:15.405 --> 00:28:17.625
Divinity School,
this time it's not me,

00:28:17.625 --> 00:28:19.369
who teaches in the Divinity
School,

00:28:19.369 --> 00:28:21.048
Adela Yarbro Collins.
 

00:28:21.048 --> 00:28:24.413
Many years ago when I was still
a student I read this book she

00:28:24.413 --> 00:28:27.058
had wrote called,
Crisis and Catharsis.

00:28:27.058 --> 00:28:29.640
It's a wonderful book about
Revelation.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.027
And her thesis was,
the very purpose of the Book of

00:28:33.027 --> 00:28:36.480
Revelation is to build up a
sense of crisis in early

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.038
followers of Jesus.
 

00:28:38.038 --> 00:28:41.433
If you're too comfortable with
your world, you don't know that

00:28:41.433 --> 00:28:44.828
things are really a lot worse
than what you think they are.

00:28:44.828 --> 00:28:48.239
If it's addressed to Christians
who are, if they're comfortable,

00:28:48.239 --> 00:28:51.051
it wants to make them
uncomfortable with Roman

00:28:51.051 --> 00:28:51.538
rule.
 

00:28:51.538 --> 00:28:55.848
If they're uncomfortable with
Roman rule, and feel depressed

00:28:55.848 --> 00:28:58.989
and oppressed,
then eventually the book will

00:28:58.989 --> 00:29:01.400
lead them to feeling comfort.
 

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:05.288
So crisis is created by the
book in order to let you

00:29:05.288 --> 00:29:08.490
experience a catharsis of the
salvation.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:13.145
The looping structure of the
book tries to work that out

00:29:13.145 --> 00:29:15.940
psychologically in its hearers.
 

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:20.538
You can see how it's going to
do this.

00:29:20.538 --> 00:29:24.609
And, remember,
it's meant to be performed.

00:29:24.609 --> 00:29:28.269
You're hearing it read out loud.
 

00:29:28.269 --> 00:29:30.269
It's a long book,
but you sit there,

00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:32.496
and you imagine a bunch of
Christians in Asia Minor in some

00:29:32.496 --> 00:29:33.734
church,
say, in Ephesus,

00:29:33.734 --> 00:29:36.590
and they're meeting is dark,
they're meeting in some house

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:38.577
somewhere,
in somebody's dining room,

00:29:38.577 --> 00:29:41.968
and somebody has sent around
this document and asked it to be

00:29:41.968 --> 00:29:42.420
read.
 

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.373
You're all sitting around with
just some candles going and

00:29:44.373 --> 00:29:47.068
somebody's reading this book,
and it's got all these strange

00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:49.125
things going on,
strange creatures,

00:29:49.125 --> 00:29:52.900
and a lot of these songs and
things that people are singing,

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:55.089
and angels are singing,
and beasts are singing,

00:29:55.089 --> 00:29:56.509
and elders are singing.
 

00:29:56.509 --> 00:30:00.038
It's sort of like in the fourth
chapter, look at the fourth

00:30:00.038 --> 00:30:01.500
chapter of Revelation.
 

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:03.349
This is where we're in the
throne room of God.

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.390
After this I looked,
and there in heaven,

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:15.028
a door stood open and the first
voice,

00:30:15.028 --> 00:30:17.078
which I had heard speaking to
me like a trumpet said,

00:30:17.078 --> 00:30:18.948
"Come up here and I will
show you what must take place

00:30:18.948 --> 00:30:19.558
after this."
 

00:30:19.558 --> 00:30:22.051
At once I was in the spirit,
and there in heaven stood a

00:30:22.051 --> 00:30:23.818
throne with one seated on the
throne.

00:30:23.818 --> 00:30:26.194
And the one seated there looks
like jasper and carnelian,

00:30:26.194 --> 00:30:28.401
and around the throne is a
rainbow that looks like an

00:30:28.401 --> 00:30:28.910
emerald.
 

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:30.450
And around the throne are
twenty-four thrones,

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.588
and seated on the thrones are
twenty-four elders dressed in

00:30:32.588 --> 00:30:34.358
white robes with golden crowns
on their heads.

00:30:34.358 --> 00:30:35.759
Coming from the throne were
flashes of lightning,

00:30:35.759 --> 00:30:37.852
rumblings, and peals of
thunder, and in front of the

00:30:37.852 --> 00:30:40.107
throne were seven flaming
torches with the seven spirits

00:30:40.107 --> 00:30:40.558
of God.
 

00:30:40.558 --> 00:30:44.308
You have all this going on and
then the four living creatures,

00:30:44.308 --> 00:30:46.471
these monstrous combination
kind of monster creatures are

00:30:46.471 --> 00:30:48.442
standing around the throne and
they starting singing

00:30:48.442 --> 00:30:50.436
"holy,
holy, holy is the Lord God

00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:52.040
Almighty,
who was, and who is,

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:53.368
and who is to come."
 

00:30:53.368 --> 00:30:55.482
Then you see the twenty-four
elders, and they're singing

00:30:55.482 --> 00:30:56.058
another song.
 

00:30:56.058 --> 00:30:59.550
The whole thing is meant to be
seen in your mind,

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:01.368
not just read silently.
 

00:31:01.368 --> 00:31:05.104
We're going to do a little
experiment here to show how that

00:31:05.104 --> 00:31:06.068
might happen.
 

00:31:06.068 --> 00:31:09.150
We're going to break up into
thirds.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:14.038
You get to be the four living
creatures.

00:31:14.038 --> 00:31:16.880
Then we're going to split the
rest of the class right here,

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.660
you all get to be--I think it's
the elders I can't remember,

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.009
and then you'll be another
group.

00:31:22.009 --> 00:31:24.460
These are the quotations.
 

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.922
I want you to say this with me
very soft at first,

00:31:27.922 --> 00:31:28.769
all right?
 

00:31:28.769 --> 00:31:31.980
Don't rush, don't get faster.
 

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:35.384
I'm a musician you know,
I'm going to make you stick

00:31:35.384 --> 00:31:36.920
with the tempo I set.
 

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:50.288
"Holy, holy,
holy is the Lord God Almighty,

00:31:50.288 --> 00:32:03.089
who was, and who is,
and who is to come."

00:32:03.089 --> 00:32:06.220
Say it!
 

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:14.289
"Worthy is the lamb that
was slain."

00:32:14.289 --> 00:32:15.390
Don't rush.
 

00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:24.098
"Worthy is the lamb that
was slain."

00:32:24.098 --> 00:32:26.952
"Glory,
honor, power to thee,

00:32:26.952 --> 00:32:28.769
oh Lord, most high.
 

00:32:28.769 --> 00:32:37.663
Glory, honor,
power to thee oh Lord most

00:32:37.663 --> 00:32:40.630
high."
 

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:45.509
Now get a little bit louder.
 

00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:49.509
There's smoke in the throne
room.

00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:59.269
There are beasts flapping their
wings.

00:32:59.269 --> 00:33:33.519
Now close your eyes and get
louder.

00:33:33.519 --> 00:33:51.420
Shout it!
 

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:53.839
Stop!
 

00:33:53.839 --> 00:33:58.078
You feel something?
 

00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:00.538
You're supposed to feel
something.

00:34:00.538 --> 00:34:03.778
You're supposed to kind of feel
weird.

00:34:03.778 --> 00:34:08.199
You're supposed to feel
uncomfortable just a little bit,

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:10.730
you're supposed to feel a
little tingle,

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:15.405
because reading Revelation as
if it's a blueprint for Jesus

00:34:15.405 --> 00:34:20.402
coming back and what's going to
happen with the Republicans and

00:34:20.402 --> 00:34:23.869
the Democrats kind of misses the
point.

00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:27.306
Because what it really is
doing, it's trying to pull you

00:34:27.306 --> 00:34:29.929
into a world,
a very performative world.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.974
That's the thing--it really is
like a stage show except the

00:34:32.974 --> 00:34:36.018
stage is the whole cosmos and
all kind of weird things that

00:34:36.018 --> 00:34:37.539
are happening all around.
 

00:34:37.539 --> 00:34:41.878
Part of what's going on here,
to use Professor Collins's

00:34:41.878 --> 00:34:46.929
phrase, is it introduces this
sense of a crisis in the cosmos.

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:49.519
It doesn't do that because it
wants you to,

00:34:49.519 --> 00:34:52.050
in the end, simply live in that
crisis.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:56.279
It's because the author
believes God's going to take

00:34:56.279 --> 00:35:01.090
care of the crisis eventually
but not necessarily today.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:05.206
The book, having this book
performed in your church for

00:35:05.206 --> 00:35:07.653
you,
read out loud in the middle of

00:35:07.653 --> 00:35:10.461
the night,
deals with your sense of

00:35:10.461 --> 00:35:12.929
persecution if you have one.
 

00:35:12.929 --> 00:35:17.380
But what if you don't have a
sense of persecution?

00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:22.239
What if you're actually fairly
comfortable with Rome?

00:35:22.239 --> 00:35:25.579
What if you're fairly well off?
 

00:35:25.579 --> 00:35:28.969
You've got a good business,
the Pax Romana,

00:35:28.969 --> 00:35:32.360
the Roman peace,
actually allows you to travel.

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.782
You can get on a ship and not
have to worry about pirates,

00:35:36.782 --> 00:35:40.661
unlike today [student
laughter], or unlike it was a

00:35:40.661 --> 00:35:42.989
hundred years before this.
 

00:35:42.989 --> 00:35:47.273
Pompey was the general who
cleaned the pirates out of the

00:35:47.273 --> 00:35:50.409
Mediterranean in the first
century BCE.

00:35:50.409 --> 00:35:53.701
So if you're a businessman,
and you're fairly well off,

00:35:53.701 --> 00:35:57.480
you might think that the Roman
peace is a pretty good thing.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:01.264
Sure a few people's heads got
to get cracked every once in a

00:36:01.264 --> 00:36:04.730
while, to keep the peace,
that's just the way it is.

00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:07.760
The Book of Revelation seems to
have a dual purpose.

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.170
It's like that old saying about
what good preaching is,

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:14.581
good preaching is supposed to
comfort the afflicted and

00:36:14.581 --> 00:36:16.349
afflict the comfortable.
 

00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:20.380
That's kind of what the Book of
Revelation seems to try to do.

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.452
Because notice,
what is the view of Rome that

00:36:23.452 --> 00:36:24.500
you get here?
 

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:27.219
Look in Revelation 18 and 19.
 

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:33.710
If all you had was the letters
of Paul,

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.800
what might you think about
Rome, what might you think about

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.029
the government,
what might you think about the

00:36:39.029 --> 00:36:39.409
emperor?
 

00:36:39.409 --> 00:36:45.574
If you all you had were certain
other books such as the Pastoral

00:36:45.574 --> 00:36:51.250
Epistles what would you think
the--about their politics?

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:54.385
There's no way you could find
this author saying something

00:36:54.385 --> 00:36:56.257
like "honor the
emperor,"

00:36:56.257 --> 00:36:59.559
which is precisely what you get
in some other early Christian

00:36:59.559 --> 00:37:00.329
letters.
 

00:37:00.329 --> 00:37:02.943
After this I saw another angel
coming down from heaven having

00:37:02.943 --> 00:37:05.253
great authority and the earth
was made bright with his

00:37:05.253 --> 00:37:05.820
splendor.
 

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.016
He called out with a might
voice, "Fallen,

00:37:08.016 --> 00:37:09.449
fallen is Babylon the Great!
 

00:37:09.449 --> 00:37:12.594
It has become a dwelling place
of demons, a haunt of every foul

00:37:12.594 --> 00:37:15.637
spirit, a haunt of every foul
bird, a haunt of every foul and

00:37:15.637 --> 00:37:16.550
hateful beast.
 

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:20.152
For all the nations have drunk
of the wine of the wrath of her

00:37:20.152 --> 00:37:22.405
fornication,
and the kings of the earth have

00:37:22.405 --> 00:37:24.516
committed fornication with her,
and the merchants,

00:37:24.516 --> 00:37:26.344
and the earth have grown rich
from the power of her

00:37:26.344 --> 00:37:26.929
luxury."
 

00:37:26.929 --> 00:37:28.469
This is clearly Rome.
 

00:37:28.469 --> 00:37:32.030
Babylon is the code name for
Rome here.

00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:37.394
We know it is because in
17:9,18 he talks about this city

00:37:37.394 --> 00:37:42.184
being on seven hills,
referring to the famous Seven

00:37:42.184 --> 00:37:43.909
Hills of Rome.
 

00:37:43.909 --> 00:37:53.110
Of course in 13:18 ...
 

00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:56.885
so that no one can buy or sell
who does not have the mark of

00:37:56.885 --> 00:38:00.789
the beast, the name of the beast
or the number of its name.

00:38:00.789 --> 00:38:03.356
This calls for wisdom,
let anyone with understanding

00:38:03.356 --> 00:38:06.326
calculate the number of the
beast, for it is the number of a

00:38:06.326 --> 00:38:06.880
person.
 

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.429
Its number is 666.
 

00:38:10.429 --> 00:38:12.960
What is 666?
 

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:17.179
Well, back in the 1980s some of
us leftists said Ronald Wilson

00:38:17.179 --> 00:38:21.329
Reagan, or you can come up with
all kinds of other things.

00:38:21.329 --> 00:38:26.148
Scholars think that if you take
the word "Nero,"

00:38:26.148 --> 00:38:31.050
the name of the Emperor and you
spell it "Neron,"

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:36.349
with a final N like you would,
in the Hebrew letters,

00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:40.280
it comes out to be 666,
adding up those three letters.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.496
Now you'll notice there's also
a footnote that says other

00:38:44.496 --> 00:38:48.893
ancient authorities say 616,
so some scribe comes along and

00:38:48.893 --> 00:38:52.373
sees 666 and said,
oh no that can't be right,

00:38:52.373 --> 00:38:53.670
it must be 616.
 

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.556
It's actually--that makes a lot
sense if this is supposed to

00:38:56.556 --> 00:38:59.297
refer to Nero because if you
spelled Nero's name slightly

00:38:59.297 --> 00:39:00.923
differently,
in a way that was still

00:39:00.923 --> 00:39:02.480
possible to spell it for the
ancient world,

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:06.230
it comes out to be 616 rather
than 666,

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:08.768
which leads a lot of us
scholars just to think the

00:39:08.768 --> 00:39:11.409
writer is probably referring to
Nero in some way.

00:39:11.409 --> 00:39:14.382
Nero is a beast,
and Nero is the whore,

00:39:14.382 --> 00:39:18.684
Rome is the whore that's had
sex with every rich man and

00:39:18.684 --> 00:39:21.969
every king throughout the whole
world.

00:39:21.969 --> 00:39:24.815
This is not a very positive
view of Rome,

00:39:24.815 --> 00:39:28.800
and Rome of course is
completely destroyed at the end.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:32.119
The part of Nero is when we
don't when this text was

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:32.768
written.
 

00:39:32.768 --> 00:39:36.237
Some people actually believe
that Revelation was written in

00:39:36.237 --> 00:39:38.869
the 60s when Nero was himself
the emperor.

00:39:38.869 --> 00:39:42.670
More tend to believe that it's
written toward the end of the

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:45.440
century, when Nero had already
been dead.

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:48.967
This refers to a great myth
from the ancient world called

00:39:48.967 --> 00:39:50.480
Nero redivivus.
 

00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:58.460
The myth was that Nero was such
a terrible,

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.844
terrible, terrible bad man that
even though he had been

00:40:01.844 --> 00:40:05.480
assassinated he was going to
rise from the dead someday.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:07.789
Or some people believed he
wasn't ever dead,

00:40:07.789 --> 00:40:10.440
he escaped and he was off
living with Parthians,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.614
who were these people who lived
on the very eastern corner of

00:40:13.614 --> 00:40:14.619
the Roman Empire.
 

00:40:14.619 --> 00:40:18.634
The idea was Nero was still
alive somewhere and he was going

00:40:18.634 --> 00:40:22.588
to raise an army of Parthians,
and he was going to come back

00:40:22.588 --> 00:40:26.009
and he was going to wage war and
take over the Roman Empire

00:40:26.009 --> 00:40:26.539
again.
 

00:40:26.539 --> 00:40:29.753
Or he was going to rise from
the dead and raise an army and

00:40:29.753 --> 00:40:31.360
take over the empire again.
 

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.146
This was especially chilling
for followers of Jesus because

00:40:35.146 --> 00:40:38.231
Nero was well known,
at the end of the century,

00:40:38.231 --> 00:40:42.005
for being the first emperor to
have persecuted the followers of

00:40:42.005 --> 00:40:43.039
Jesus in Rome.
 

00:40:43.039 --> 00:40:46.385
The famous story is that
Nero--there was a big fire in

00:40:46.385 --> 00:40:48.375
Rome,
and Nero was blamed for the

00:40:48.375 --> 00:40:51.730
fire because he was clearing a
bunch of apartment buildings of

00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:54.699
lower income people out of a
certain area of Rome,

00:40:54.699 --> 00:40:57.949
it's right by the Coliseum,
to build his huge big palace.

00:40:57.949 --> 00:40:59.724
In fact now,
if you go to Rome,

00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:02.565
they've opened up the Golden
House, they call it,

00:41:02.565 --> 00:41:05.170
and this was the palace that
Nero built.

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.132
It's beautiful,
you have to go under the ground

00:41:07.132 --> 00:41:09.519
to get into it and see it and
everything because it's all

00:41:09.519 --> 00:41:10.630
covered by the ground.
 

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.219
If you go to Rome,
get tickets and go to Nero's

00:41:13.219 --> 00:41:16.541
palace because it's only in the
last several years that it's

00:41:16.541 --> 00:41:18.400
been reopened for the public.
 

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.911
The idea was,
Nero had actually burned a

00:41:20.911 --> 00:41:24.710
bunch of tenements in order to
make room for his palace,

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:27.213
but because this was so
unpopular he blamed it on the

00:41:27.213 --> 00:41:27.840
Christians.
 

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:29.860
He said, the Christians set the
fire,

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:31.440
the Christians are those really
bad people,

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:35.311
and the story goes that he had
big barbeques in his palace

00:41:35.311 --> 00:41:39.523
grounds and he put the bodies of
Christians covered with tar on

00:41:39.523 --> 00:41:43.188
stakes and crucified them,
and put them on stakes,

00:41:43.188 --> 00:41:47.257
and lit them and their burning
bodies provided the torchlight

00:41:47.257 --> 00:41:48.409
for his party.
 

00:41:48.409 --> 00:41:51.853
This is the story that was
circulated about Nero by later

00:41:51.853 --> 00:41:54.130
Christians and by other people
too.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:57.465
For followers of Jesus,
Nero was this terrible figure,

00:41:57.465 --> 00:42:01.304
who they thought he might even
rise again from the dead and do

00:42:01.304 --> 00:42:02.690
battle against us.
 

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:04.760
What does all this make sense
of?

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.768
The writer is giving this big
myth,

00:42:08.768 --> 00:42:12.989
obviously the whore is killed,
Babylon is killed,

00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:15.706
Rome is destroyed,
all the wealthy people are

00:42:15.706 --> 00:42:18.432
destroyed,
all the kings of the earth are

00:42:18.432 --> 00:42:21.639
destroyed by the angels and by
Jesus coming down.

00:42:21.639 --> 00:42:25.260
And then the setting up of the
new Jerusalem that's gold and

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:27.717
beautiful,
and there's no night or day

00:42:27.717 --> 00:42:31.527
there because God is its light
and everybody lives happily ever

00:42:31.527 --> 00:42:32.079
after.
 

00:42:32.079 --> 00:42:36.090
What is the kind of situation
that this speaks too?

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:38.710
We're going to go back to the
beginning of Revelation now.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:39.869
Look at chapter 2.
 

00:42:46.079 --> 00:42:49.219
These are in the letters.
 

00:42:49.219 --> 00:42:53.170
We know it was written by a guy
named John.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:56.050
He says he was imprisoned on
the isle of Patmos in the

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:59.202
Mediterranean when he wrote
this, and then he circulates it

00:42:59.202 --> 00:42:59.800
around.
 

00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:03.280
He starts off with these seven
letters to seven churches.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.500
"To the angel of the
church in Ephesus."

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:10.980
Ephesus, we've seen Ephesus
haven't we?

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:15.864
One of pseudo-Paul's letters
may have been addressed to

00:43:15.864 --> 00:43:16.768
Ephesus.
 

00:43:16.768 --> 00:43:19.523
Paul apparently did found a
church in Ephesus,

00:43:19.523 --> 00:43:22.829
and it was one of his bigger
churches it seems like.

00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:24.110
He spent years there.
 

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:27.411
These are the words of him who
holds the seven stars in his

00:43:27.411 --> 00:43:30.768
right hand, who walks among the
seven golden lamp stands.

00:43:30.768 --> 00:43:32.679
I know your works,
your toil, and your patient

00:43:32.679 --> 00:43:33.190
endurance.
 

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.675
I know that you cannot tolerate
evil doers, you have tested

00:43:35.675 --> 00:43:38.333
those who claim to be apostles
but are not, and have found them

00:43:38.333 --> 00:43:39.018
to be false.
 

00:43:39.018 --> 00:43:41.320
[There are false apostles
running around.],

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.077
I also know that you are
enduring patiently and bearing

00:43:44.077 --> 00:43:46.831
up for the sake of my name,
and that you have not grown

00:43:46.831 --> 00:43:47.150
weary.
 

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:49.599
But I have this against you ....
 

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:52.858
See some of the letters are
mainly letters of praise to the

00:43:52.858 --> 00:43:55.670
churches and some of them are
scolding letters,

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:58.460
so it's interesting to see what
does he scold people for,

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.518
and what does he praise them
for?

00:44:00.518 --> 00:44:03.635
Remember, then,
from what you have fallen,

00:44:03.635 --> 00:44:04.320
repent.
 

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.038
[This is a backslid church he
thinks.]

00:44:07.038 --> 00:44:09.389
Do the works you did at first.
 

00:44:09.389 --> 00:44:11.737
If not, I will come to you and
remove your lamp stand from its

00:44:11.737 --> 00:44:12.739
place unless you repent.
 

00:44:12.739 --> 00:44:15.327
Yet this is to your credit,
you hate the works of the

00:44:15.327 --> 00:44:16.969
Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
 

00:44:16.969 --> 00:44:18.760
[Well, we don't really know
anything about the Nicolaitans,

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.090
so that doesn't tell us much.]
Let anyone who has an ear,

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:23.750
listen to what the spirit is
saying to the churches.

00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.804
To everyone who conquers I will
give permission to eat from the

00:44:26.804 --> 00:44:29.070
tree of life that is in the
paradise of God.

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:31.349
Then he goes onto another
church.

00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:36.268
So there are false apostles,
but then look at 2:9:

00:44:36.268 --> 00:44:40.014
I know your affliction and your
poverty, even though you are

00:44:40.014 --> 00:44:40.460
rich.
 

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:43.431
I know the slander on the part
of those who say that they are

00:44:43.431 --> 00:44:45.860
Jews but are not,
but are a synagogue of Satan.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.949
There is this poverty,
he's praising poverty.

00:44:48.949 --> 00:44:51.960
He talks about people who -say
they're Jews but they're not.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.489
2:13: "I know where you
are living."

00:44:54.489 --> 00:44:57.429
This is to Pergamum which
happened to be a huge site of

00:44:57.429 --> 00:44:59.880
the imperial cult,
the cult to the emperor.

00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:02.099
In fact you can go there now,
I'm going to be there in June,

00:45:02.099 --> 00:45:02.889
aren't you jealous?
 

00:45:02.889 --> 00:45:04.699
You can go to the top of this
mountain,

00:45:04.699 --> 00:45:09.327
the Acropolis in Pergamum,
and the Austrian archeologists

00:45:09.327 --> 00:45:14.614
are rebuilding all these temples
to Trajan and Hadrian on the top

00:45:14.614 --> 00:45:16.018
of this hill.
 

00:45:16.018 --> 00:45:18.467
Of course Trajan and Hadrian
are after he wrote this,

00:45:18.467 --> 00:45:20.679
but there was still a big
emperor cult there.

00:45:20.679 --> 00:45:24.000
I know where you are living,
where Satan's throne is.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.778
[well maybe that's a reference
to the emperor cult itself.]

00:45:27.778 --> 00:45:30.059
You are holding fast to my
name,

00:45:30.059 --> 00:45:32.338
you did not deny your faith in
me even in the days of Antipas

00:45:32.338 --> 00:45:34.364
my witness,
I have some things against you,

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:35.280
you have some ....
 

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.302
Well, I'm running out of time
but let me tell you what

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:40.300
basically he really doesn't
like.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:42.992
He doesn't like a woman named,
he calls Jezebel,

00:45:42.992 --> 00:45:45.800
who is one of the prophets in
one the churches.

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.389
He doesn't like rich people.
 

00:45:48.389 --> 00:45:51.199
He says stuff about idolatry
which makes it sound like he

00:45:51.199 --> 00:45:54.309
doesn't like people who are
eating meat sacrificed to idols.

00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:57.085
We don't think there were any
of these churches that were

00:45:57.085 --> 00:45:58.920
actually practicing pagan
idolatry.

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.646
What's probably going on is,
he knows that there are some

00:46:01.646 --> 00:46:03.739
Christians who eat meat
sacrificed to idols,

00:46:03.739 --> 00:46:05.250
and he calls that idolatry.
 

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:09.313
Now let's think about it,
which churches are in this area

00:46:09.313 --> 00:46:13.670
of western Asia Minor that have
women as leaders in them,

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.824
they've been told by their
apostle that it's okay to eat

00:46:16.824 --> 00:46:20.539
meat sacrificed to idols,
and some of them are not that

00:46:20.539 --> 00:46:22.358
poor,
like there seem to be people in

00:46:22.358 --> 00:46:24.050
Corinth who seem to be fairly
well off.

00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:26.579
Maybe this guy,
and this is just a theory,

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:28.260
but I think it's fun to think
about,

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.588
maybe he's actually writing to
Paul's churches precisely

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:35.280
because he thinks they're too
comfortable with Roman rule,

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:39.322
and he wants to make them
uncomfortable with Roman rule in

00:46:39.322 --> 00:46:43.577
order to turn them against Rome
and to convert him to his own

00:46:43.577 --> 00:46:47.480
vision about this anti-Roman
version of the Gospel.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:49.510
And that's why he constructs
the letter to say,

00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:52.313
as I said, if you're troubled,
if you feel like you're

00:46:52.313 --> 00:46:55.329
oppressed you're supposed to be
comforted by this text.

00:46:55.329 --> 00:46:58.898
But if you're too comfortable
with the Pax Romana

00:46:58.898 --> 00:47:02.402
you're supposed to be mad
uncomfortable by the text and

00:47:02.402 --> 00:47:04.090
get on the right side.
 

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:07.862
On Wednesday we'll talk about
some texts that may have been

00:47:07.862 --> 00:47:10.139
more comfortable with Roman
rule.

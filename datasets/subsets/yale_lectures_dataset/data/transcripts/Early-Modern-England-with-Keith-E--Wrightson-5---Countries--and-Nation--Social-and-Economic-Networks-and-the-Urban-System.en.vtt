00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:02.983
Prof: Right.
 

00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:06.461
Well, today is the fourth and
final of the contextual lectures

00:00:06.461 --> 00:00:08.800
introducing sixteenth-century
England.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.796
We've looked at the social
order, we've looked at

00:00:11.796 --> 00:00:14.662
households,
institutions and relationships

00:00:14.662 --> 00:00:17.672
in local communities,
and now I want to look at the

00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:20.690
networks of connection that tie
the whole thing together,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.512
joining up the dots as it were,
so it's a bit of historical

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:27.676
geography or if you like a kind
of guided tour of

00:00:27.676 --> 00:00:33.380
sixteenth-century England,
a bit of historical tourism.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.902
Well, last time I stressed that
local communities had a certain

00:00:38.902 --> 00:00:43.890
distinctive local peculiarity or
local particularity,

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.513
which was partly constructed
out of their local customs and

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:48.450
institutions.
 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.271
But it was also something that
was influenced by the different

00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:56.030
ways that they were linked
together into the larger world.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.350
The myriad of tiny local
communities in this period was

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.590
on the one hand a kind of
complex of places which were

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.188
distinctive entities in their
own right,

00:01:08.188 --> 00:01:14.039
but on the other hand they were
also integral parts socially and

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:19.501
politically of larger spaces,
and it's those larger spaces

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:24.843
and the ties that bound them
together that I'm most concerned

00:01:24.843 --> 00:01:26.090
with today.
 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.394
Okay.
 

00:01:26.394 --> 00:01:29.385
Well, amongst the most
significant of those larger

00:01:29.385 --> 00:01:32.070
spaces are what contemporaries
referred to as

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.720
"countries".
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.535
They used that word not in the
modern sense of a territorial

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:41.800
state but to mean a distinctive
area,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.316
a landscape,
a society, in some respects a

00:01:46.316 --> 00:01:48.080
local culture.
 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.038
These countries as they thought
of them could be quite

00:01:52.038 --> 00:01:54.876
localized,
for example on the Scottish

00:01:54.876 --> 00:01:57.584
border Teviotdale,
or down in Gloucestershire the

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:58.379
Vale of Berkeley.
 

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:01.010
These were regarded as
distinctive countries.

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.920
Or they could use the term more
broadly.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.956
People talked about the North
Country, they talked about the

00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:10.188
West Country;
areas with less distinct

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:11.919
boundaries.
 

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:15.479
When someone said in a letter,
or in a political speech,

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:19.378
or whatever,
that he was referring to the

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:25.520
opinion of his country he was
referring to such a local area.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.890
Such countries are usually
discussed by historians in terms

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.282
of contrasting landscapes,
physical geography,

00:02:33.282 --> 00:02:36.750
and to a certain extent
economic activity.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.389
If you look at map one,
the small relief map,

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:48.173
you'll find that agrarian
England was customarily divided

00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:50.395
up into,
on the one hand,

00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:53.520
the highland zone of the north
and the west--

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.449
you have all the high land
represented there,

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:58.169
the highland zone--and on the
other hand,

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.710
the lowland zone of the south
and east.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.903
That's one way of perceiving
these--the broad distinctions

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:11.370
that were noticed at the time
and subsequently.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.229
On the other hand,
people sometimes make

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.139
distinctions between what they
called the 'fielden' areas,

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.688
areas that practiced mixed
agriculture,

00:03:18.688 --> 00:03:23.412
mostly lowland,
and various pastoral zones

00:03:23.412 --> 00:03:27.788
practicing mainly animal
husbandry,

00:03:27.788 --> 00:03:29.650
and they could be of various
types.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.590
There were the open hill
pastures of the highland.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.758
There were the woodland
pastures.

00:03:35.758 --> 00:03:39.389
Much of the west of England was
still pretty densely wooded,

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.508
some parts of East Anglia as
well, and they practiced a

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:47.628
distinctive pastoral husbandry
focusing on dairying.

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:52.406
And then finally there were the
pastoral practices of the

00:03:52.406 --> 00:03:55.252
fenlands,
the areas of eastern England

00:03:55.252 --> 00:03:59.354
which were waterlogged in winter
and where for the most part the

00:03:59.354 --> 00:04:02.218
inhabitants practiced pastoral
husbandry.

00:04:02.218 --> 00:04:04.750
It's a very distinctive area in
this period,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.244
flooded during the winter,
the inhabitants regarded as

00:04:08.244 --> 00:04:11.870
having an extremely distinctive
culture of their own.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.068
In fact, shreds of that
continue.

00:04:14.068 --> 00:04:17.689
It's often said that people
from the fens have webbed feet.

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.129
&gt;
 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:20.810
This is not true.
 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.694
I had a roommate from the fens
when I was a student and he

00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:28.442
definitely didn't have webbed
feet--though he was a good

00:04:28.442 --> 00:04:29.259
swimmer.
 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:33.744
Well, this kind of distinction
in the physical geography can be

00:04:33.744 --> 00:04:37.940
extended to Scotland and Wales
but there's less variety.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.839
Scotland--two thirds of
Scotland is highland.

00:04:41.839 --> 00:04:46.437
Only the lowland zone between
the Forth and the Clyde is

00:04:46.437 --> 00:04:50.031
really very good for
agriculture, for arable

00:04:50.031 --> 00:04:53.709
agriculture, and areas around
the coast.

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:57.088
Wales again dominated by the
central Cambrian massif,

00:04:57.088 --> 00:05:00.725
very difficult in this period
to travel north to south in

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:03.389
Wales unless you go around the
coast.

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.971
Most of the major routes
traveled east to west because of

00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:09.279
the mountains.
 

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:11.740
So it's less varied.
 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.059
Okay.
 

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:14.930
If we turn to another kind of
distinctiveness,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.184
there's that associated with
the practice of various

00:05:18.184 --> 00:05:21.120
industrial activities in the
countryside.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.214
That was a matter not so much
of the physical geography -

00:05:25.214 --> 00:05:29.307
though that could influence
their location--but dependent

00:05:29.307 --> 00:05:30.990
upon other factors.
 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.750
We think of this as the
pre-industrial age,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.980
and yet there were already some
areas which were rendered

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.795
distinctive by,
for example,

00:05:38.795 --> 00:05:42.476
the practice of mining and
quarrying that clearly depended

00:05:42.476 --> 00:05:44.350
upon geographical factors.
 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.033
You get lead being mined in the
hills of Derbyshire or in the

00:05:48.033 --> 00:05:52.139
hills of Somersetshire--
down here--iron in the Forest

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:56.052
of Dean and down in Sussex,
down here, and coal was

00:05:56.052 --> 00:05:59.773
produced especially around the
River Tyne in the northeast and

00:05:59.773 --> 00:06:03.432
in a scattering of other places
across the countryside and in

00:06:03.432 --> 00:06:04.470
South Wales.
 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.906
These industries were already
established, and then there was

00:06:08.906 --> 00:06:10.088
metal working.
 

00:06:10.088 --> 00:06:12.692
There was a great deal of metal
working around the town of

00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:15.432
Birmingham in the west Midlands
which later grew into a great

00:06:15.432 --> 00:06:17.206
city,
one of England's greatest

00:06:17.206 --> 00:06:19.579
centers in the industrial
revolution for light

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:20.370
engineering.
 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.720
That was based on its earlier
metal working trade.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.795
When Henry VIII invaded
Scotland in 1523,

00:06:26.795 --> 00:06:30.946
he placed bulk orders for
arrowheads from the smiths of

00:06:30.946 --> 00:06:32.100
Birmingham.
 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.480
They supplied him.
 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.050
Sheffield was also very well
known for its metal working;

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.841
the knives of Sheffield were
very famous as indeed to some

00:06:40.841 --> 00:06:42.440
extent they still are.
 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.060
Most people carried what they
called a Sheffield whittle--

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.531
a whittle-- a little knife that
you carried around with you to

00:06:49.531 --> 00:06:53.062
cut your food and it's from that
name of course that we get the

00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:56.692
practice of whittling--
whittling wood--from a

00:06:56.692 --> 00:06:58.500
Sheffield whittle.
 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.889
Okay.
 

00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.617
Above all, there was on a much
larger scale the manufacture of

00:07:04.617 --> 00:07:07.718
woolen cloth,
usually manufactured in the

00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:11.439
putting-out system which I
described to you;

00:07:11.439 --> 00:07:16.338
raw materials put out by
capitalist clothiers to workers

00:07:16.338 --> 00:07:21.120
who spun the wool into yarn,
wove the yarn into cloth in

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.312
their own cottages scattered
across the villages around a

00:07:25.312 --> 00:07:26.959
major urban center.
 

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:30.839
And that kind of organization
in the putting-out system of the

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:33.639
cloth industry was very
widespread indeed.

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:36.730
Many of the villages of East
Anglia were heavily involved.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:40.242
Parts of Kent,
lots of places in the West

00:07:40.242 --> 00:07:42.495
Country,
and a number of places

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:45.420
scattered across the north were
heavily involved in

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.990
manufacturing England's most
famous product at this time,

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:54.000
high-quality woolen cloth.
 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:54.838
All right.
 

00:07:54.838 --> 00:07:58.949
All that's fine as a brief
descriptive typology of

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:03.480
different kinds of areas and
their distinctiveness.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.915
Physical geography goes only so
far in explaining all this

00:08:07.915 --> 00:08:08.850
variation.
 

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:14.807
It's also to do with the--not
only the physical attributes of

00:08:14.807 --> 00:08:18.579
the area but also invisible
factors;

00:08:18.579 --> 00:08:23.228
the patterns of connection,
the patterns of interaction,

00:08:23.228 --> 00:08:28.045
the flows of goods and people
which gave areas distinctive

00:08:28.045 --> 00:08:29.230
qualities.
 

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.057
So, for example,
to indicate what I'm trying to

00:08:33.057 --> 00:08:36.184
express here,
the fact that the coal industry

00:08:36.184 --> 00:08:39.429
was centered on Tyneside (up
here in the northeast of the

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.847
country) was not simply because
coal was found there and was

00:08:42.847 --> 00:08:46.033
found near to the surface where
it could be reached with

00:08:46.033 --> 00:08:48.120
relatively simple technology.
 

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.418
It was also to do with the fact
that it lay very close to the

00:08:51.418 --> 00:08:53.938
River Tyne,
a major navigable river,

00:08:53.938 --> 00:08:56.225
so the coal,
which was bulky and difficult

00:08:56.225 --> 00:08:59.268
to transport,
could easily be put onto small

00:08:59.268 --> 00:09:02.615
boats called 'keels',
brought down the river on

00:09:02.615 --> 00:09:04.798
to--and loaded onto collier
ships--

00:09:04.798 --> 00:09:08.523
which then transported it
easily down the coast to the

00:09:08.523 --> 00:09:12.808
cities along the coast and above
all to the city of London.

00:09:12.808 --> 00:09:16.547
London could never have grown
as it did in this period if it

00:09:16.547 --> 00:09:20.601
hadn't had regular fuel supplies
brought at a reasonable price by

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:23.009
coastal routes from the
northeast.

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:26.587
That's why the northeast became
the center of the coal industry

00:09:26.587 --> 00:09:29.761
whereas other areas which had
coal deposits were not yet

00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:33.809
exploited;
they were too inaccessible.

00:09:33.809 --> 00:09:35.980
Well, that's one example.
 

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.232
One could think of others,
but it's examining flows of

00:09:40.232 --> 00:09:44.647
that kind that's crucial to
understanding how particular

00:09:44.647 --> 00:09:49.142
localities developed their
special qualities and also the

00:09:49.142 --> 00:09:53.394
way in which they got
articulated into larger national

00:09:53.394 --> 00:09:54.678
systems.
 

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:58.898
So to understand all of that
one needs to look at these

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:03.741
connections and the flows which
linked local societies together

00:10:03.741 --> 00:10:05.928
into the national whole.
 

00:10:05.928 --> 00:10:08.172
One could look--one can
look--at those connections in

00:10:08.172 --> 00:10:08.690
many ways.
 

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.183
There are the connections which
have to do with the state and

00:10:12.183 --> 00:10:15.561
we'll look at them next week
when I look at the early Tudor

00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:18.590
monarchy and the reassertion of
royal authority.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:20.999
There were connections to do
with the church and we look at

00:10:20.999 --> 00:10:22.908
them a lot in dealing with the
Reformation,

00:10:22.908 --> 00:10:25.890
but today I want to focus
principally on connections

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.639
through markets and through
flows of people,

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:31.460
demographic flows across the
countryside,

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.873
and in particular looking at
them through the pattern of the

00:10:35.873 --> 00:10:40.681
urban system,
the towns which helped to

00:10:40.681 --> 00:10:47.759
organize and to some extent
channel these flows.

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:51.664
Well, for analytical purposes
you can distinguish various

00:10:51.664 --> 00:10:53.269
levels of connection.
 

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:56.827
There were local market areas
based on a small market town

00:10:56.827 --> 00:11:00.198
linking together the activities
of the villagers within

00:11:00.198 --> 00:11:01.759
particular countries.
 

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:05.975
Secondly, there were regional
and interregional patterns of

00:11:05.975 --> 00:11:08.248
trade,
and finally there were trading

00:11:08.248 --> 00:11:11.269
systems of national or even
international significance.

00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:15.070
Some--I'll touch on each of
them in turn.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:21.360
Local market areas were based
upon small market towns.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.306
Within a particular country the
rural and the urban were not

00:11:26.306 --> 00:11:27.899
separate spheres.
 

00:11:27.899 --> 00:11:32.327
It's helpful to think of them
as being bound together by

00:11:32.327 --> 00:11:35.710
connections to a particular
market town.

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:39.251
All towns needed the country's
products of food and raw

00:11:39.251 --> 00:11:40.038
materials.
 

00:11:40.038 --> 00:11:44.306
The country depended upon the
towns to provide a place to

00:11:44.306 --> 00:11:47.505
trade and also for specialist
manufactures,

00:11:47.505 --> 00:11:50.629
specialist services of various
kinds.

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:55.063
So the essential unit to think
of is the market town and its

00:11:55.063 --> 00:11:58.897
hinterland, and one can
distinguish various kinds of

00:11:58.897 --> 00:12:00.100
market town.
 

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:01.658
Some of them were really very
tiny.

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:06.070
The smallest ones were not very
impressive as urban entities.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.970
They were just large villages.
 

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:11.803
They've been described as
villages with an overlay of

00:12:11.803 --> 00:12:14.460
urban activities,
market villages.

00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.827
One person rather poetically
has described these market towns

00:12:18.827 --> 00:12:21.450
as being "foci in
time".

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.720
They just came alive on market
day.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.216
The rest of the time they're
pretty much just like any other

00:12:27.216 --> 00:12:27.808
village.
 

00:12:27.808 --> 00:12:31.845
Well, those are the settlements
that provided weekly markets and

00:12:31.845 --> 00:12:33.960
a range of specialist services.
 

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.220
Most rural villages would have
a smith,

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.741
a carpenter,
a wheelwright,

00:12:37.741 --> 00:12:41.197
but there were other crafts
which needed a bigger market and

00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:44.360
so they tended to be located in
the market towns,

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.921
people like coopers who made
barrels or joiners who made

00:12:47.921 --> 00:12:49.538
furniture and so forth.
 

00:12:49.538 --> 00:12:53.332
To give you a specific example,
there's an area of the county

00:12:53.332 --> 00:12:55.610
of Suffolk called Babergh
Hundred.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.600
There's the name.
 

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.889
That's how it's spelt.
 

00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:01.110
It's a delightful area of the
country.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:05.280
A recent survey by the Royal
Commission on Historical

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.772
Monuments found that in that
area no less than 24% of the

00:13:09.772 --> 00:13:12.418
houses date back before 1700.
 

00:13:12.418 --> 00:13:16.129
It's got a remarkable level of
survival of late medieval and

00:13:16.129 --> 00:13:19.399
early modern buildings,
which makes it delightful.

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:22.389
You've probably seen it many
times in BBC shows.

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:26.114
If you want an ideal English
village, that's the kind of

00:13:26.114 --> 00:13:28.009
place you'd go to film it.
 

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:31.283
Well, Babergh Hundred:
in 1522, there was a survey

00:13:31.283 --> 00:13:34.755
done of able-bodied men which
led them to listing the

00:13:34.755 --> 00:13:38.029
inhabitants and their trades and
occupations.

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:40.759
There were thirty-two
settlements in the area.

00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:44.586
Twenty-seven of them had only
between two and fourteen

00:13:44.586 --> 00:13:46.320
different occupations.
 

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.212
Four of them had between
eighteen and twenty-seven

00:13:49.212 --> 00:13:50.039
occupations.
 

00:13:50.039 --> 00:13:52.808
They were the market towns.
 

00:13:52.808 --> 00:13:57.182
And finally there was one place
which had as many as forty-nine

00:13:57.182 --> 00:13:58.168
occupations.
 

00:13:58.168 --> 00:14:01.062
That was a big market town,
the town of Sudbury,

00:14:01.062 --> 00:14:04.139
the name which will be familiar
to you no doubt.

00:14:04.139 --> 00:14:08.840
There are many Sudburys in the
United States.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.865
Well, all market towns,
then, were essentially closely

00:14:12.865 --> 00:14:16.889
connected and part of the
countryside they served,

00:14:16.889 --> 00:14:21.070
they gained their living from
it, but they also served to bind

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:25.386
those settlements into what you
can think of as a kind of social

00:14:25.386 --> 00:14:29.019
area around which people move on
a regular basis.

00:14:29.019 --> 00:14:32.494
Just to take an example of
this, there was a small village

00:14:32.494 --> 00:14:34.139
called Kibworth Harcourt.
 

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:37.620
It's in Leicestershire,
around about there.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:43.033
A study of Kibworth Harcourt's
been done which shows that

00:14:43.033 --> 00:14:49.025
Kibworth Harcourt lay within a
day's walk of a variety of small

00:14:49.025 --> 00:14:50.668
market towns.
 

00:14:50.668 --> 00:14:54.178
So here we are in Kibworth
Harcourt;

00:14:54.178 --> 00:14:59.508
people who had different things
to sell on any given day of the

00:14:59.508 --> 00:15:04.836
week virtually could go out to a
market town nearby and in turn

00:15:04.836 --> 00:15:10.164
people were coming in from other
villages to those market towns

00:15:10.164 --> 00:15:12.830
on different market days.
 

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:15.172
What you get is the
interconnection of the whole

00:15:15.172 --> 00:15:16.019
area of course.
 

00:15:16.019 --> 00:15:18.893
All the villagers from these
different communities are

00:15:18.893 --> 00:15:22.037
gradually intermingling in the
marketplaces of these market

00:15:22.037 --> 00:15:22.580
towns.
 

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.899
That's how a local society
meshed together.

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:29.360
Contemporaries were very aware
of this.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.581
In the course of the
Reformation when the attempt to

00:15:32.581 --> 00:15:35.548
Protestantize the country was at
its height,

00:15:35.548 --> 00:15:40.101
a good deal of attention was
paid for example to preaching in

00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:41.240
market towns.
 

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.519
Preachers were appointed to
preach in market towns.

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:45.330
That was how you reached the
people.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:49.019
That's how you penetrated an
area.

00:15:49.019 --> 00:15:51.649
Well, in addition,
some market towns had a

00:15:51.649 --> 00:15:55.139
stronger role,
the bigger ones like Sudbury

00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:59.595
which could articulate patterns
of interaction over a

00:15:59.595 --> 00:16:02.080
significantly larger area.
 

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.389
One historical geographer has
described these as what he calls

00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:10.489
"cardinal markets,"
really important ones linking

00:16:10.489 --> 00:16:12.678
countries into sub regions.
 

00:16:12.678 --> 00:16:16.823
A very good example is the town
of Richmond in North Yorkshire

00:16:16.823 --> 00:16:19.269
which has been quite well
studied.

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:22.870
Richmond was placed between the
hills of the Yorkshire Dales,

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:26.389
beautiful high country,
sheep country,

00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:29.850
wonderful place to go walking
or hiking,

00:16:29.850 --> 00:16:32.298
and the Vale of York,
the lowland Vale of York.

00:16:32.298 --> 00:16:35.750
It channeled the relationship
between those two areas,

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:40.289
the sheep and the dairy produce
of the dales including the

00:16:40.289 --> 00:16:44.990
famous Wensleydale cheese which
you may have encountered.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:47.210
It's available in some places
in America;

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.080
recommend it.
 

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.772
A big wedge of Wensleydale on
top of a slice of apple pie

00:16:53.772 --> 00:16:58.548
eaten together is definitely one
of life's more fulfilling

00:16:58.548 --> 00:16:59.889
experiences.
 

00:16:59.889 --> 00:17:00.950
&gt;
 

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:02.155
I would recommend it.
 

00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:05.143
It's a sort of--it's a sort
of--crumbly white cheese,

00:17:05.143 --> 00:17:05.660
tangy.
 

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.865
The best Wensleydale is still
made from sheep's milk,

00:17:08.865 --> 00:17:12.501
originally made by monks from
the monasteries in that region

00:17:12.501 --> 00:17:13.920
but still produced.
 

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.970
Anyway, &gt;
 

00:17:14.970 --> 00:17:18.029
cheese, sheep,
wool coming down to Richmond

00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:22.402
where they meet the grain and
cloth and other products coming

00:17:22.402 --> 00:17:26.336
up from the Vale of York and
that's the main center for

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:27.430
exchange.
 

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:31.550
In 1536, when the north rose
against the Reformation in the

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.535
rebellion known as the
Pilgrimage of Grace,

00:17:34.535 --> 00:17:37.519
Richmond was one of its major
centers.

00:17:37.519 --> 00:17:40.924
Proclamations of the rebellion
took place at the market cross

00:17:40.924 --> 00:17:41.720
in Richmond.
 

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.369
Again it makes perfect sense.
 

00:17:43.369 --> 00:17:48.058
This is how you reached people.
 

00:17:48.058 --> 00:17:52.914
Actually, speaking of Richmond,
only if you'll forgive a small

00:17:52.914 --> 00:17:55.755
divergence,
when people visit Britain they

00:17:55.755 --> 00:17:58.328
very often go to London,
Oxford, Cambridge,

00:17:58.328 --> 00:18:03.134
maybe Canterbury Cathedral,
and then skip up to Edinburgh

00:18:03.134 --> 00:18:04.509
or whatever.
 

00:18:04.509 --> 00:18:08.605
It's well worth taking the time
to go to some of the provincial

00:18:08.605 --> 00:18:11.710
regions where you can see some
lovely places.

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:14.421
The north is a very good
example and Richmond is a

00:18:14.421 --> 00:18:15.858
splendid place to visit.
 

00:18:15.858 --> 00:18:19.923
It's an almost perfect market
town for the twelfth-century

00:18:19.923 --> 00:18:23.558
castle perched on a bluff above
the River Swale,

00:18:23.558 --> 00:18:25.574
delightful streets,
mostly seventeenth- and

00:18:25.574 --> 00:18:28.942
eighteenth-century,
built in sort of yellowish

00:18:28.942 --> 00:18:32.200
sandstone,
monastery ruins.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.868
It's got everything and
people--tourists--don't visit

00:18:34.868 --> 00:18:36.410
places like this very often.
 

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:37.990
It's well worth doing.
 

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:41.374
If you happen to go to Richmond
I would recommend near the

00:18:41.374 --> 00:18:44.817
marketplace there's an inn
called the Black Lion which does

00:18:44.817 --> 00:18:47.548
excellent lunches
&gt;

00:18:47.548 --> 00:18:50.335
and, as you'd expect in that
part of the country,

00:18:50.335 --> 00:18:53.759
the roast lamb is terrific but
then they have modernized.

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:58.657
They do now have vegetarian
options and they have wonderful

00:18:58.657 --> 00:18:59.250
beer.
 

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.730
&gt;
 

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:06.580
The Black Sheep Brewery is a
small brewery in that area which

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:12.140
is very well known and they
produce Black Sheep Bitter and

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:18.480
also a most unusual bottled beer
which is called Riggwelter,

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.170
which needs explaining.
 

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:22.880
It's a dialect word.
 

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.660
A riggwelter in the dialect of
this particular area of the

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:30.574
north of England is a sheep
which has fallen on its back and

00:19:30.574 --> 00:19:32.099
can't get up again.
 

00:19:32.099 --> 00:19:33.099
&gt;
 

00:19:33.099 --> 00:19:34.828
This happens with sheep.
 

00:19:34.828 --> 00:19:37.602
They trip, they roll on their
backs and then they lie there

00:19:37.602 --> 00:19:39.848
waggling their feet,
&gt;

00:19:39.848 --> 00:19:41.750
and the shepherd has to come
and turn them up again.

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:45.698
Well, that is--in the dialect
of the area a sheep like that is

00:19:45.698 --> 00:19:47.662
riggweltered;
it's a riggwelter,

00:19:47.662 --> 00:19:49.921
and they call this bottled beer
Riggwelter

00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:51.410
&gt;
 

00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:54.647
because if you consume it in
unwise quantities

00:19:54.647 --> 00:19:56.519
&gt;
 

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:58.859
it has exactly the same effect.
 

00:19:58.859 --> 00:20:01.068
&gt;
 

00:20:01.068 --> 00:20:06.038
Anyway, I tell you this not to
encourage you but to,

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:09.788
you know--if you did happen to
go to that part of England to

00:20:09.788 --> 00:20:12.650
warn you against the possible
consequences.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:13.700
&gt;
 

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.115
Okay.
 

00:20:14.115 --> 00:20:19.115
Well, to get back to the point,
so we have significant market

00:20:19.115 --> 00:20:23.450
towns and they connect villages
into localities,

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:30.078
localities into countries,
countries into sub regions.

00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:33.689
And that role is revealed in
their recorded patterns of

00:20:33.689 --> 00:20:35.160
population mobility.
 

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.682
As you know,
village populations were not

00:20:37.682 --> 00:20:39.068
rooted and immobile.
 

00:20:39.068 --> 00:20:42.858
People moved about finding work
as servants,

00:20:42.858 --> 00:20:47.038
marrying, taking up a tenancy
of land that was available and

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:49.303
so forth,
and to some extent you can

00:20:49.303 --> 00:20:52.780
trace the distances people moved
from their place of birth in the

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.140
course of their lives.
 

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.858
One study has been done of
Worcestershire,

00:20:55.858 --> 00:20:58.631
over here on the Welsh border,
and that suggests that people

00:20:58.631 --> 00:21:01.450
were generally living within ten
miles of the place they were

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.501
born,
so kind of moving around their

00:21:03.501 --> 00:21:05.432
country,
and there are other similar

00:21:05.432 --> 00:21:05.900
studies.
 

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:10.270
A very good one was done of
Kent of the geography of

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.358
marriage,
and it found that half of the

00:21:13.358 --> 00:21:17.618
people in the study married
people from their home parish,

00:21:17.618 --> 00:21:22.500
70% married people from under
five miles,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.750
84% married people from under
ten miles,

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:30.096
and 95% married people from
under fifteen miles from where

00:21:30.096 --> 00:21:33.098
they were born,
and again it gives a sense of

00:21:33.098 --> 00:21:36.471
the area in which people were
moving around and where they of

00:21:36.471 --> 00:21:38.269
course met marriage partners.
 

00:21:38.269 --> 00:21:39.368
Okay.
 

00:21:39.368 --> 00:21:43.801
Well, distances like that
reflect the area of regular

00:21:43.801 --> 00:21:49.086
social interaction and movement
shaped by local markets and the

00:21:49.086 --> 00:21:55.582
towns where they were located,
which created social areas with

00:21:55.582 --> 00:22:01.926
their own distinctive identities
and their own particular

00:22:01.926 --> 00:22:03.740
orientations.
 

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:07.551
I've noticed since living in
Connecticut that there's an

00:22:07.551 --> 00:22:10.808
invisible wall across
Connecticut which seems to

00:22:10.808 --> 00:22:13.788
divide Red Sox fans from Yankees
fans,

00:22:13.788 --> 00:22:16.046
which presumably has something
to do with the kind of

00:22:16.046 --> 00:22:18.519
orientation of people to
different parts of the state,

00:22:18.519 --> 00:22:21.328
towards New York or towards
Boston so--

00:22:21.328 --> 00:22:23.838
and it's an example of the kind
of thing I'm talking about,

00:22:23.838 --> 00:22:26.048
the way in which people's
connections,

00:22:26.048 --> 00:22:29.099
where they go shopping,
where they go for business and

00:22:29.099 --> 00:22:31.920
so forth orient them in
particular directions,

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.580
and that's what created these
countries in sixteenth-century

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:36.450
England too.
 

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:39.710
Okay. Let's move on.
 

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:44.599
In addition,
there were some longer distance

00:22:44.599 --> 00:22:45.509
flows.
 

00:22:45.509 --> 00:22:49.993
The key commodities that one
finds in these interregional

00:22:49.993 --> 00:22:54.719
systems of connection and of
interdependence were of several

00:22:54.719 --> 00:22:55.519
kinds.
 

00:22:55.519 --> 00:22:57.230
There were foodstuffs.
 

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:00.486
Not every area produced enough
food to feed its local

00:23:00.486 --> 00:23:01.298
population.
 

00:23:01.298 --> 00:23:06.109
You tend to get a flow of grain
from the south and east towards

00:23:06.109 --> 00:23:07.740
the north and west.
 

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:11.150
A lot of it went up the coast
for example from East Anglia,

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.234
and in reverse you get flows of
animal products from the

00:23:15.234 --> 00:23:19.691
pastoral areas of the north down
to the south heading usually

00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:21.400
towards the cities.
 

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.007
Many cattle and sheep were
driven in great herds having

00:23:25.007 --> 00:23:28.948
been assembled in the market
towns of the north and the west

00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:31.592
and Wales,
driven down to London in

00:23:31.592 --> 00:23:35.218
particular where they'd be
fattened up in the villages

00:23:35.218 --> 00:23:39.392
around London by graziers before
being sold to the butchers of

00:23:39.392 --> 00:23:40.349
the city.
 

00:23:40.349 --> 00:23:42.339
So you get flows of that kind.
 

00:23:42.339 --> 00:23:45.960
You get flows of raw materials.
 

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:49.164
The wool which was produced in
East Anglia or Lincolnshire or

00:23:49.164 --> 00:23:52.262
the north would find its way
down to the woolen industry in

00:23:52.262 --> 00:23:53.920
the west and the southeast.
 

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.828
And one gets other things too.
 

00:23:56.828 --> 00:24:03.016
The luxury products which were
traded over long distances,

00:24:03.016 --> 00:24:08.660
things like wine and spices,
fine-quality fabrics.

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.397
They would tend to come in
through London or one of the

00:24:12.397 --> 00:24:16.481
major ports like Bristol and
then be disseminated across the

00:24:16.481 --> 00:24:17.588
countryside.
 

00:24:17.588 --> 00:24:21.852
Longer distance flows of
foodstuffs, raw materials,

00:24:21.852 --> 00:24:24.665
luxury goods,
and indeed some less

00:24:24.665 --> 00:24:27.650
significant manufactured goods.
 

00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:33.390
The knives of Sheffield were
found everywhere in the country.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.942
If you visit London and are
standing by the river at low

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:39.517
tide,
you might notice people on the

00:24:39.517 --> 00:24:43.424
mud banks by the side of the
river putting mud into sieves

00:24:43.424 --> 00:24:44.660
and sieving it.
 

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.660
They're known as mudlarks.
 

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.470
They're amateur archeologists.
 

00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:55.156
What they're doing is finding
stuff in the mud which fell out

00:24:55.156 --> 00:24:58.358
of people's pockets in London
long ago.

00:24:58.358 --> 00:25:02.969
As you probably are aware,
the taxi system of

00:25:02.969 --> 00:25:08.521
sixteenth-century London
was--were little boats on the

00:25:08.521 --> 00:25:09.568
river.
 

00:25:09.568 --> 00:25:12.402
Watermen rowed people hither
and thither and Shakespeare

00:25:12.402 --> 00:25:15.333
in Love is a good example of
that kind of thing if you've

00:25:15.333 --> 00:25:16.308
seen that movie.
 

00:25:16.308 --> 00:25:20.148
Things fell out of people's
pockets when they were on the

00:25:20.148 --> 00:25:22.960
river and they can be found in
the mud.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:27.779
Anyway, one of the most common
things the mudlarks find are

00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:29.358
Sheffield knives.
 

00:25:29.358 --> 00:25:33.480
People carried a knife all the
time and they would fall in the

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:37.328
river and they can be found and
they end up in museums.

00:25:37.328 --> 00:25:41.058
Well, longer distance flows
then.

00:25:41.058 --> 00:25:43.919
Any town could have a role in
distributing goods over the

00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:47.352
longer distance,
but some had a particularly

00:25:47.352 --> 00:25:52.460
important role and they were of
greater than sub-regional

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.920
significance.
 

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:58.002
And the greatest of them are
sometimes described as being

00:25:58.002 --> 00:26:01.755
provincial capitals,
places which in the early

00:26:01.755 --> 00:26:07.068
sixteenth century would have a
population over 5,000 or 6,000,

00:26:07.068 --> 00:26:11.519
which seems paltry to modern
eyes but was quite significant

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:15.338
at the time,
and which exerted influence

00:26:15.338 --> 00:26:18.700
over a whole area of the
country.

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:23.405
To give a good example,
York, effectively the capital

00:26:23.405 --> 00:26:25.759
of the north of England.
 

00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:31.845
York was a city of ancient
origin and considerable

00:26:31.845 --> 00:26:33.460
importance.
 

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.118
It was the great ecclesiastical
center of the north.

00:26:36.118 --> 00:26:40.365
The Archbishop of York was
based there in York Minster,

00:26:40.365 --> 00:26:42.410
the wonderful cathedral.
 

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:45.269
It was the center of royal
government for the north.

00:26:45.269 --> 00:26:50.241
The king's Council of the North
sat at York in the King's Manor,

00:26:50.241 --> 00:26:54.346
and York was also a natural
point of exchange for the

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:57.029
largest county in the kingdom.
 

00:26:57.029 --> 00:27:01.384
If you look at your map of
towns and counties,

00:27:01.384 --> 00:27:07.578
you'll see that Yorkshire--up
here--by far the biggest county.

00:27:07.578 --> 00:27:14.811
Well, York dominated the
trading networks of the entire

00:27:14.811 --> 00:27:15.750
area.
 

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:19.446
It provided also all kinds of
specialist services for the

00:27:19.446 --> 00:27:21.558
whole of the north of England.
 

00:27:21.558 --> 00:27:25.257
If your church needed new
bells, York was the only place

00:27:25.257 --> 00:27:27.140
you could get a bell cast.
 

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:31.490
If you wanted to buy a clock,
you would probably need to go

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:32.240
to York.
 

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.925
Not many clocks were
manufactured,

00:27:33.925 --> 00:27:36.787
it was a very specialist
occupation, a tiny number of the

00:27:36.787 --> 00:27:37.808
greatest cities.
 

00:27:37.808 --> 00:27:39.964
If you wanted a book
beautifully bound,

00:27:39.964 --> 00:27:41.269
you would go to York.
 

00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:44.381
York had people like
bookbinders serving the

00:27:44.381 --> 00:27:46.190
cathedral and so forth.
 

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:52.155
Its position on the River Ouse
meant that it was also a town

00:27:52.155 --> 00:27:57.920
which controlled a major artery
of long-distance trade.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:02.696
The River Ouse runs up from the
city of Hull on the coast up

00:28:02.696 --> 00:28:07.636
into North Yorkshire and along
the river would pass many goods

00:28:07.636 --> 00:28:12.009
being landed at Hull and coming
up into the area,

00:28:12.009 --> 00:28:17.843
or coming down the river and
then being shipped to national

00:28:17.843 --> 00:28:20.660
and international markets.
 

00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.858
Any of the really great cities
of the time had that same kind

00:28:24.858 --> 00:28:25.558
of role.
 

00:28:25.558 --> 00:28:29.799
Norwich was in effect the
capital of East Anglia and was

00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:32.730
the second largest city at the
time.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:38.009
Bristol, in effect the capital
of the West Country.

00:28:38.009 --> 00:28:41.962
Chester, very significant also
to the north of Wales and

00:28:41.962 --> 00:28:46.058
controlling trade with Ireland,
and so one could go on.

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:50.625
Newcastle up in the northeast
also very significant,

00:28:50.625 --> 00:28:55.640
strategically important,
close to the Scottish border.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:59.051
Just as patterns of population
mobility within particular

00:28:59.051 --> 00:29:02.769
localities indicate the local
social areas within which people

00:29:02.769 --> 00:29:05.740
moved,
so the patterns of migration to

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.823
the really great cities tell us
about their regional and

00:29:09.823 --> 00:29:12.048
interregional significance.
 

00:29:12.048 --> 00:29:13.404
For Norwich,
for example,

00:29:13.404 --> 00:29:16.737
there are surviving lists of
apprentices and where they came

00:29:16.737 --> 00:29:19.730
from, the young men who came in
to learn a trade.

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:22.423
They came from all over East
Anglia, the whole region,

00:29:22.423 --> 00:29:24.098
and indeed from further afield.
 

00:29:24.098 --> 00:29:27.672
Norwich was important enough to
pull people in from the

00:29:27.672 --> 00:29:31.508
Midlands, and the same sort of
thing is true of other areas

00:29:31.508 --> 00:29:33.890
that can be studied in that way.
 

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:38.593
In Bristol a similar study
shows that the apprentices came

00:29:38.593 --> 00:29:43.048
from all over the west Midlands
and they came from--

00:29:43.048 --> 00:29:47.832
let me just check the
figure--thirty-seven different

00:29:47.832 --> 00:29:52.708
towns and villages of which
twenty-five were actually

00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:57.960
located on the River Severn
which runs up like that.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.759
It's pretty obvious what was
going on here.

00:29:59.759 --> 00:30:03.632
These places were particularly
connected to Bristol through the

00:30:03.632 --> 00:30:07.316
river trade and people were
coming down river to start their

00:30:07.316 --> 00:30:09.690
careers in Bristol as
apprentices.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.682
Bristol also drew apprentices
from Wales and from the

00:30:13.682 --> 00:30:15.450
southwest of England.
 

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:19.960
Okay.
 

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.329
Okay.
 

00:30:20.329 --> 00:30:24.781
Cities such as Bristol or York
or Norwich were already places

00:30:24.781 --> 00:30:26.858
of national significance.
 

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:31.681
They focused entire regions and
bound them together into the

00:30:31.681 --> 00:30:36.338
national unit and they channeled
inter-regional trade,

00:30:36.338 --> 00:30:39.698
but the final element of the
kind of articulation that I'm

00:30:39.698 --> 00:30:42.472
talking about,
of course, is at the ultimate

00:30:42.472 --> 00:30:45.529
national level and that's
provided above all by the

00:30:45.529 --> 00:30:49.450
capital city,
London.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:54.344
As you know from your reading,
the English urban system in

00:30:54.344 --> 00:30:57.348
this period was rather
polarized.

00:30:57.348 --> 00:31:02.054
There was only one city with
more than 15,000 population in

00:31:02.054 --> 00:31:06.108
the early sixteenth century and
that was London.

00:31:06.108 --> 00:31:10.528
Nowhere else could come near
rivaling London.

00:31:10.528 --> 00:31:14.232
In the 1520s,
London already had a population

00:31:14.232 --> 00:31:18.692
of 55,000, which made it
something like four times the

00:31:18.692 --> 00:31:22.058
size of Norwich,
and it was growing.

00:31:22.058 --> 00:31:27.230
Indeed, it was to grow to a
population of something like

00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:32.400
200,000 by the last decades of
the sixteenth century.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.174
London was the biggest
marketing center for food and

00:31:36.174 --> 00:31:37.358
raw materials.
 

00:31:37.358 --> 00:31:41.721
London--supplying London meant
farmers all over eastern and

00:31:41.721 --> 00:31:46.232
southern England were sending
their goods towards the capital

00:31:46.232 --> 00:31:46.910
city.
 

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:48.890
There was a lot of road traffic.
 

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:53.038
There was also river traffic
down the River Thames,

00:31:53.038 --> 00:31:58.184
coastal traffic bringing goods
to where they could be landed to

00:31:58.184 --> 00:31:59.680
supply London.
 

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.901
London was also the biggest
supplier of goods that were

00:32:02.901 --> 00:32:04.990
desired elsewhere in the
kingdom.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.237
It was the biggest center of
manufacturing of all kinds of

00:32:09.237 --> 00:32:13.856
things which would be sent out
to cities and towns elsewhere in

00:32:13.856 --> 00:32:15.048
the kingdom.
 

00:32:15.048 --> 00:32:18.833
It was the biggest supplier
also of all kinds of specialist

00:32:18.833 --> 00:32:22.288
services which weren't readily
available elsewhere.

00:32:22.288 --> 00:32:24.358
London had a lot of lawyers for
example.

00:32:24.358 --> 00:32:28.065
If you wanted legal business
done, London was the place to

00:32:28.065 --> 00:32:28.390
go.
 

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:32.182
London was where the royal
courts met, hearing the most

00:32:32.182 --> 00:32:33.868
important court cases.
 

00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:37.564
London was the place which had
a lot of proper

00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:42.490
university-trained physicians if
you had medical problems.

00:32:42.490 --> 00:32:46.987
It was very rare to find a
physician like that out in a

00:32:46.987 --> 00:32:48.068
small town.
 

00:32:48.068 --> 00:32:50.618
So it was the place to go for
all kinds of things.

00:32:50.618 --> 00:32:55.044
An almost ridiculous example:
if you were a great nobleman or

00:32:55.044 --> 00:32:59.319
a gentleman and you wanted to
have a grand renaissance tomb

00:32:59.319 --> 00:33:04.039
erected in your parish church in
preparation for your death.

00:33:04.039 --> 00:33:05.269
And lots of them did this.
 

00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:07.659
They even wrote the
inscriptions themselves while

00:33:07.659 --> 00:33:10.645
they were still alive saying
what wonderful guys they'd been,

00:33:10.645 --> 00:33:12.038
&gt;
 

00:33:12.038 --> 00:33:14.974
and if you wanted something
like that and you could afford

00:33:14.974 --> 00:33:17.190
it, London was the place that
you got it.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.655
That's where the stone masons
were who would do something like

00:33:19.655 --> 00:33:19.940
that.
 

00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.380
They were manufactured in
London, to order,

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:26.913
and then shipped out in pieces
to wherever they were to be

00:33:26.913 --> 00:33:30.510
erected and then they would be
erected by local masons in a

00:33:30.510 --> 00:33:33.548
parish church somewhere else in
the kingdom,

00:33:33.548 --> 00:33:37.329
just--it's true but it's a
silly example in a way,

00:33:37.329 --> 00:33:40.720
but it makes the point.
 

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.838
Right.
 

00:33:41.838 --> 00:33:49.088
Above all, London was the great
center of international trade.

00:33:49.088 --> 00:33:52.575
The dominance of London was
based upon the fact that it was

00:33:52.575 --> 00:33:55.759
so close to the crossing across
to the Netherlands.

00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:59.040
You can have a short voyage
across the North Sea to the

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.868
cities of the Netherlands and
above all the city of Antwerp,

00:34:02.868 --> 00:34:07.303
which should be marked on the
bottom corner of your map but

00:34:07.303 --> 00:34:12.119
seems to have gotten lost in the
Xerox machine in some cases.

00:34:12.119 --> 00:34:17.101
London was the major market for
English cloth which was exported

00:34:17.101 --> 00:34:22.320
abroad and it was the principal
place where imports were landed.

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:27.134
In fact, woolen cloth alone
made up two thirds of English

00:34:27.134 --> 00:34:30.659
exports in the early sixteenth
century.

00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:34.244
Two thirds of English exports
were woolen cloth,

00:34:34.244 --> 00:34:38.820
and at least half of that cloth
went to the Continent through

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.659
London.
 

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:44.119
It was gathered in London from
all over the north and the west

00:34:44.119 --> 00:34:48.215
of England and from Wales and
exported in fleets of ships

00:34:48.215 --> 00:34:52.530
organized by a company called
the Merchant Adventurers.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:56.257
In return, all kinds of goods
were brought back especially

00:34:56.257 --> 00:34:58.940
from the Netherlands:
luxury textiles,

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:02.373
fine-quality linen,
silk, miscellaneous

00:35:02.373 --> 00:35:06.619
manufactures which were not made
in England,

00:35:06.619 --> 00:35:07.980
pins for example.
 

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.719
They didn't manufacture pins in
England.

00:35:09.719 --> 00:35:11.780
They came from Holland.
 

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.829
Starch--they didn't manufacture
starch;

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:16.340
that came from the Netherlands
too.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:19.599
Paper--there were no paper
manufacturers in England.

00:35:19.599 --> 00:35:21.768
The book trade,
based in London of course,

00:35:21.768 --> 00:35:26.298
depended upon imports of paper
from the Netherlands and then

00:35:26.298 --> 00:35:29.139
there were all sorts of
groceries,

00:35:29.139 --> 00:35:32.989
olive oil, fruit,
spices, sugar,

00:35:32.989 --> 00:35:33.860
wine.
 

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:38.190
A great deal of this came via
the Netherlands.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:41.273
The Netherlands was the great
trading area of northern Europe

00:35:41.273 --> 00:35:43.442
with its cities,
notably Antwerp,

00:35:43.442 --> 00:35:46.869
and they connected the trade of
Scandinavia,

00:35:46.869 --> 00:35:50.960
the Baltic in the north,
to trade down the Atlantic

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.659
coast and to the Mediterranean.
 

00:35:53.659 --> 00:35:57.302
And also the river routes of
Europe which culminated in the

00:35:57.302 --> 00:36:00.570
Netherlands, like the Rhine,
all brought in goods.

00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:05.858
The Netherlands was the center
and England was connected to

00:36:05.858 --> 00:36:08.960
world trade via the Netherlands.
 

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.449
I keep mentioning Antwerp.
 

00:36:10.449 --> 00:36:13.608
Antwerp was the center of all
of this and its importance was

00:36:13.608 --> 00:36:14.840
very well recognized.
 

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:17.880
It was with Antwerp that the
English traded above all.

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:23.461
It's no accident that when Sir
Thomas More in 1517 wrote his

00:36:23.461 --> 00:36:26.632
book,
Utopia, he sets it in

00:36:26.632 --> 00:36:30.855
Antwerp where he presents
himself on an embassy to

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:33.900
Antwerp,
which actually took place,

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.231
talking to the sailor Raphael
Hythloday who tells him the

00:36:38.231 --> 00:36:43.025
story of the wonderful land of
Utopia which he's located in his

00:36:43.025 --> 00:36:44.960
voyages to the west.
 

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.230
Other things came from the
Netherlands too;

00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:49.559
ideas.
 

00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:54.302
It was one of the major centers
for the smuggling of early

00:36:54.302 --> 00:36:58.628
Protestant books into England
from the 1520s onwards,

00:36:58.628 --> 00:36:59.960
for example.
 

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:06.222
So London's dominant position
was reflected in the fact that

00:37:06.222 --> 00:37:10.679
it had a truly national
migration field.

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:16.074
A study's been done of 1,000
new freemen of the city in 1551

00:37:16.074 --> 00:37:20.922
to 1553, young men completing
their apprenticeship and

00:37:20.922 --> 00:37:23.940
becoming freemen of the city.
 

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:27.594
Only a fifth of them had been
born in London or the

00:37:27.594 --> 00:37:29.570
metropolitan area itself.
 

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:33.289
A quarter of them came from the
southeast and East Anglia,

00:37:33.289 --> 00:37:35.449
a quarter of them came from the
Midlands,

00:37:35.449 --> 00:37:38.099
a quarter of them came from the
north,

00:37:38.099 --> 00:37:40.117
and then there were a
scattering of others from

00:37:40.117 --> 00:37:43.260
different parts of the kingdom,
relatively few from the

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.050
southwest.
 

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.679
Probably the importance of
Bristol meant that young men

00:37:46.679 --> 00:37:49.360
from the southwest went there
rather than to London,

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:58.010
but London's catchment area was
truly national.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:01.750
Well, this description and
analysis of marketing structures

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:05.554
and the way they're articulated
perhaps gives a sense of the

00:38:05.554 --> 00:38:09.487
integrated nature of a system of
exchange already in the early

00:38:09.487 --> 00:38:13.920
sixteenth century,
and so it was.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.530
It's not difficult to imagine a
merchant sitting in his counting

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:23.067
house in Bristol perhaps eating
some salt fish which would have

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:26.360
been caught off the coast of
North Wales.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:29.784
It would have been packed into
barrels which were made with

00:38:29.784 --> 00:38:33.150
barrel stays which probably were
imported from Ireland via

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:33.860
Chester.
 

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:37.992
It would be salted with salt
which was produced in the county

00:38:37.992 --> 00:38:39.440
of Cheshire nearby.
 

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.601
If he's accompanying it with a
little wine, that would have

00:38:43.601 --> 00:38:47.547
come from southwestern France
and was probably landed in

00:38:47.547 --> 00:38:48.409
Bristol.
 

00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:50.840
If he was drinking that out of
a pewter goblet,

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:54.755
the pewter would have been made
with lead from the Mendip Hills

00:38:54.755 --> 00:38:58.545
and tin from Cornwall probably
actually produced by craftsmen

00:38:58.545 --> 00:39:00.440
working in Bristol itself.
 

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:04.161
And maybe he's wearing a nice
gown to keep the drafts off

00:39:04.161 --> 00:39:07.949
which would be fine-quality
worsted cloth from Norwich.

00:39:07.949 --> 00:39:10.967
And if he's got a fine linen
shirt because he's very well

00:39:10.967 --> 00:39:13.070
off, it would be Netherlandish
linen.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:16.130
That was the best;
the cheap stuff came from

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:17.610
England and Lincolnshire.
 

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:23.335
And if he'd starched his
collar, the starch would have

00:39:23.335 --> 00:39:26.469
come from Antwerp probably.
 

00:39:26.469 --> 00:39:27.869
Let's have him cut his fish up.
 

00:39:27.869 --> 00:39:29.349
He uses a Sheffield knife.
 

00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:31.340
&gt;
 

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.440
Well, it's easy to imagine that.
 

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:39.117
That--it mattered that those
connections existed and they did

00:39:39.117 --> 00:39:42.043
exist,
but we also finally just have

00:39:42.043 --> 00:39:46.621
to appreciate the limits of that
kind of sophisticated commercial

00:39:46.621 --> 00:39:47.980
interconnection.
 

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:52.362
Remember what I've said before:
this was still primarily a

00:39:52.362 --> 00:39:56.208
rural world in which people
lived within relatively

00:39:56.208 --> 00:40:00.668
contained areas and focused
mostly on a little bit of local

00:40:00.668 --> 00:40:04.590
exchange and producing their own
subsistence.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:09.574
So most people most of the time
had only limited connections to

00:40:09.574 --> 00:40:13.193
these larger flows,
to these larger commercial

00:40:13.193 --> 00:40:14.239
networks.
 

00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:17.217
The people who were really
involved with them were

00:40:17.217 --> 00:40:20.619
distinctive groups in society:
townspeople of course,

00:40:20.619 --> 00:40:23.960
especially the inhabitants of
the greater cities;

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.893
to a lesser extent also the
inhabitants of those areas like

00:40:27.893 --> 00:40:31.760
the industrial areas which were
producing goods for longer

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.690
distance trade;
the big commercial farmers who

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:41.059
were involved in longer distance
marketing of grain or cattle,

00:40:41.059 --> 00:40:45.900
and a variety of middlemen who
conducted that trade.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.717
And finally deeply involved in
all of this were the social

00:40:49.717 --> 00:40:50.320
elites.
 

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.739
They were the people who
consumed the luxuries.

00:40:52.739 --> 00:40:55.833
They were the people who went
down to London to attend the

00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:57.570
royal court from time to time.
 

00:40:57.570 --> 00:41:03.880
They were the people who had
truly national social networks

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:08.670
with their equals as members of
the elite.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:12.012
But the point is that the
intensity of the integration

00:41:12.012 --> 00:41:12.960
varied a lot.
 

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.130
It varied socially;
it varied geographically.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:19.324
Some areas were probably pretty
densely connected and

00:41:19.324 --> 00:41:22.150
commercialized,
the southeast in particular.

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:25.380
It has more towns,
it's more heavily populated,

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:28.469
it has a better road system,
and so forth.

00:41:28.469 --> 00:41:32.809
Other areas were less closely
interconnected.

00:41:32.809 --> 00:41:36.891
Some of the longer distance
connections I've described were

00:41:36.891 --> 00:41:40.974
flowing across areas where
people's lives were in fact much

00:41:40.974 --> 00:41:43.860
more contained on a day-to-day
basis.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:47.347
When historians try to
conceptualize the whole thing

00:41:47.347 --> 00:41:50.764
they have to try to express both
the reality of the

00:41:50.764 --> 00:41:54.251
interconnections and their
importance but also their

00:41:54.251 --> 00:41:57.675
limits,
the continuing importance of

00:41:57.675 --> 00:42:00.320
localism within your country.
 

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:05.746
People talk about an elaborate
mosaic of interlocking local

00:42:05.746 --> 00:42:06.869
societies.
 

00:42:06.869 --> 00:42:11.034
They talk about what was still
a highly territorialized

00:42:11.034 --> 00:42:14.429
society, although a national
society also.

00:42:14.429 --> 00:42:18.755
They talk about an amalgam of
different local societies at

00:42:18.755 --> 00:42:23.460
different stages of development
all influencing each other,

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:33.480
and yet often a world in which
old ways coexisted with the new.

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:37.159
Well, both dimensions of the
picture have validity.

00:42:37.159 --> 00:42:41.346
Commercial relations have a
vital place, and yet many local

00:42:41.346 --> 00:42:45.027
societies and economies were
still to a great degree

00:42:45.027 --> 00:42:47.409
autonomous or semiautonomous.
 

00:42:47.409 --> 00:42:51.882
All in all, it could be
described as not yet a fully

00:42:51.882 --> 00:42:57.233
integrated commercial society
but a traditional agrarian world

00:42:57.233 --> 00:43:00.480
with a limited commercial
sector.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.813
Within that commercial sector
the predominant flows tended to

00:43:04.813 --> 00:43:09.510
be from the north and the west
towards the south and the east,

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:13.476
but to imagine it as being
simply a dynamic advanced

00:43:13.476 --> 00:43:18.068
southeastern core and a rather
backward northern and western

00:43:18.068 --> 00:43:22.969
periphery doesn't do justice to
the more distant provinces.

00:43:22.969 --> 00:43:27.565
It's better,
I think, to think in terms of

00:43:27.565 --> 00:43:33.954
certain core activities which
are to be found all over the

00:43:33.954 --> 00:43:40.567
kingdom though they tend to be
somewhat more concentrated in

00:43:40.567 --> 00:43:43.369
the south and east.
 

00:43:43.369 --> 00:43:51.510
But those outposts and those
connections really mattered.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:57.137
They exercised a degree of
leverage in local economies,

00:43:57.137 --> 00:44:01.619
on local cultures,
and on local politics.

00:44:01.619 --> 00:44:06.481
So we have a set of local
societies, local economies,

00:44:06.481 --> 00:44:11.809
even local cultures with
important elements of linkage.

00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:14.300
It's those links,
those connections,

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.628
that get activated and get
elaborated by some of the really

00:44:18.628 --> 00:44:21.840
significant developments of this
period,

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:24.949
the commercial developments,
of course,

00:44:24.949 --> 00:44:28.467
most obviously perhaps,
but it's also through those

00:44:28.467 --> 00:44:32.760
same links and connections that
people in distant areas of the

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.983
kingdom became involved in some
of the other major changes of

00:44:36.983 --> 00:44:39.722
the period,
the so-called educational

00:44:39.722 --> 00:44:42.543
revolution,
the growth of literacy,

00:44:42.543 --> 00:44:46.610
religious change,
political change.

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:51.034
What I've been talking about
really is essentially a

00:44:51.034 --> 00:44:56.590
framework of communication which
is central to economic life,

00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:03.641
to cultural life,
to the political dynamism of

00:45:03.641 --> 00:45:05.679
the period.
 

00:45:05.679 --> 00:45:10.653
And finally the national
society as a whole was one which

00:45:10.653 --> 00:45:14.030
was created not only by those
ties,

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:17.329
vital as they were,
but also by other forces,

00:45:17.329 --> 00:45:22.340
by political forces and by
religious forces,

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.762
and it's those that I'm going
to turn to next week when we

00:45:26.762 --> 00:45:31.108
come at last to look at the
activities of the early Tudor

00:45:31.108 --> 00:45:35.842
kings and to what was going on
in the church on the eve of the

00:45:35.842 --> 00:45:37.239
Reformation.
 

00:45:37.239 --> 00:45:40.717
So context done,
hopefully it will help you to

00:45:40.717 --> 00:45:45.199
understand the dynamics of
change which we turn to next.

00:45:45.199 --> 00:45:50.000

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.080
Prof: All right?
 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.272
All right.
 

00:00:02.272 --> 00:00:02.560
Let us begin.
 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.760
Let us--we'll turn down the
music of Charles Ives.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.461
We'll come back to the music of
Charles Ives,

00:00:08.461 --> 00:00:11.286
but let us begin with our
discussion of musical

00:00:11.286 --> 00:00:14.480
form--continuing our discussion
of musical form.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.340
Last time we talked really
about three forms.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.263
We talked about verse and
chorus in popular music and we

00:00:21.263 --> 00:00:24.830
had a wonderful presentation by
Frederick Evans.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.688
And I hope you came away with
the following:

00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:30.879
that in dealing with verse and
chorus, basically,

00:00:30.879 --> 00:00:34.172
you have the same material;
you have the same musical

00:00:34.172 --> 00:00:36.540
material coming back again and
again and again.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.308
With the chorus we actually
have the same text coming back

00:00:40.308 --> 00:00:42.160
again and again and again.
 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.683
But with the verses although
the music is the same,

00:00:45.683 --> 00:00:48.220
the text keeps changing each
time.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.660
We get new strophes--or new
verses--of text.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.231
So keep that in mind:
verse, chorus,

00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:53.950
verse, chorus.
 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.840
Sometimes this can start with
the chorus.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.811
Sometimes there's a harmonic
change in here that we would

00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:00.840
call the bridge,
but essentially it's the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.475
repetition of the same material
over and over again in terms of

00:01:03.475 --> 00:01:05.584
the music--
but in terms of the text,

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:08.188
you get new text each time for
the verses.

00:01:08.188 --> 00:01:13.222
We also talked about the
simplest of all of these musical

00:01:13.222 --> 00:01:15.021
forms: ternary form.
 

00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:15.828
Right?
 

00:01:15.828 --> 00:01:18.223
And that was simply this idea
of statement,

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:19.989
contrast, statement--A,
B, A.

00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:23.735
Very straightforward,
not too much we need do with

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:24.269
that.
 

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:28.739
Today we're going to go on and
talk about theme and variations,

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:31.941
and with regard to all three of
these I should say that all

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:33.930
three of these forms are very
old.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.593
I could go back into the Middle
Ages and get a responsory of the

00:01:38.593 --> 00:01:41.260
Middle Ages that is in A B A
form.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.772
I could go back into the Middle
Ages and bring up an early

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:51.000
fifteenth-century English carol
that's in verse and chorus form.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.138
I could go back into the Middle
Ages and find you instrumental

00:01:55.138 --> 00:01:58.260
pieces that are in theme and
variation form.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.578
So these three are very old.
 

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:04.352
Now, the fourth one that we
talked about,

00:02:04.352 --> 00:02:08.030
sonata-allegro form,
is adventitious.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.718
It's something constructed in
the eighteenth century--

00:02:10.718 --> 00:02:12.878
adventitious to the eighteenth
century--

00:02:12.878 --> 00:02:16.312
so it's something put together
in some measure by Joseph Haydn

00:02:16.312 --> 00:02:18.620
and then passed on to his good
friend,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.250
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.141
So sonata-allegro form--this
big, complex musical form--is a

00:02:24.141 --> 00:02:26.650
little bit different than the
other.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.128
It's a lot younger.
 

00:02:28.128 --> 00:02:31.500
It's a lot newer--beginning
with the period of classical

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.830
music--Mozart,
Haydn, and Beethoven.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.723
All right.
 

00:02:34.723 --> 00:02:37.853
With that by way of an
introduction,

00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:41.430
let's go back to sonata-allegro
form.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.710
We said that was the largest,
the most complex,

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.949
of these musical forms.
 

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:47.250
Why are we dealing with this?
 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.413
Well, next--a week from
Saturday--we will go to this

00:02:50.413 --> 00:02:54.134
concert and we will sit there
and we listen to pieces on this

00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:54.878
concert.
 

00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:58.250
The opening piece will be in
sonata-allegro form.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.020
It will be by Mozart.
 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.378
Then we will have a piece by
Johannes Brahms in theme and

00:03:03.378 --> 00:03:04.400
variation form.
 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.126
Then we will have a symphony by
Beethoven in five

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:10.762
movements--it's an exception and
we'll explain why when we get to

00:03:10.762 --> 00:03:12.240
it--in five movements.
 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.572
But within those movements we
have a couple of instances of

00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:19.659
sonata-allegro form,
a couple of instances of theme

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.181
and variation form,
and one instance of ternary

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:22.530
form.
 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.658
So all of these forms will be
necessary.

00:03:25.658 --> 00:03:30.738
We will have to understand how
these forms work in order for us

00:03:30.738 --> 00:03:34.258
to really engage that particular
concert.

00:03:34.258 --> 00:03:36.232
For example,
you'll be asked to write a

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:37.530
review of that concert.
 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.780
And I was thinking this
morning, well,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.500
a kind of mediocre review would
say,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.643
"Well, in the middle of
the first movement of the

00:03:44.643 --> 00:03:46.498
Beethoven piece--
and we--once again,

00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:48.729
we wouldn't call it a 'song'--
in the middle of the

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.538
Beethoven--first movement of the
Beethoven symphony--

00:03:51.538 --> 00:03:55.030
things seem to be
disorganized."

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.568
What I'd like to hear there is
"Well,

00:03:58.568 --> 00:04:01.490
in the development section--in
the development section--

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.699
of the first movement of the
Beethoven symphony,

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:12.280
it seemed disorganized because
the counterpoint was not clear,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.298
because the imitative entries
of the parts was not clearly

00:04:16.298 --> 00:04:17.709
articulated."
 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.408
And that would be a much more
specific sort of response to the

00:04:21.408 --> 00:04:23.833
music, a much more educated,
if you will,

00:04:23.833 --> 00:04:25.410
response to the music.
 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.853
So that's where we're going
with all this to get you to

00:04:28.853 --> 00:04:32.872
think about precisely where you
are and precisely what should be

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:34.949
happening,
and then, is it really

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:36.579
happening the way it should be.
 

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:39.004
Now as said,
sonata-allegro form is the most

00:04:39.004 --> 00:04:41.598
difficult of these,
and it takes a little extra

00:04:41.598 --> 00:04:43.459
time to get familiar with it.
 

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:47.829
We're going to be reviewing
this in section starting this

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:48.610
evening.
 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.574
And don't forget we have this
model of what sonata-allegro

00:04:52.574 --> 00:04:53.269
form is.
 

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:55.815
I didn't want to put that up on
the board again--did that last

00:04:55.815 --> 00:04:58.447
time--but you've got it on page
one hundred ninety-three of your

00:04:58.447 --> 00:04:58.990
textbook.
 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.021
If you want that complex
diagram, one hundred

00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:02.500
ninety-three of your textbook.
 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.389
So get familiar with that.
 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.144
And do, once again,
bring your books to section

00:05:07.144 --> 00:05:10.560
this time, 'cause we'll read
them in section this time.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.069
So we've got this complex form.
 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.920
nd I've figured out over the
years the way to sort of wrap

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.839
your arms around this or get
into this, understand this.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:26.329
And it involves the fact that
music in the classical period is

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:29.750
what we would call rhetorical
music.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.899
It's doing something at every
moment.

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:33.596
It is doing,
as I see it,

00:05:33.596 --> 00:05:35.079
one of four things.
 

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:39.829
It's presenting a theme so
we'll have a--what we call a

00:05:39.829 --> 00:05:41.589
thematic function.
 

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:45.850
It's moving from point A to
point B.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.569
Remember with the Beethoven
&gt;

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.915
--that's the opening theme,
and then the second theme is

00:05:51.915 --> 00:05:53.740
&gt;.
 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:54.670
Well, those are both themes.
 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.949
That's stating something that
we can sing, that we can

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:58.629
remember.
 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:02.187
But Beethoven has to get from
point A, the minor,

00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:05.817
to point B, the more lyrical
major, so he writes a

00:06:05.817 --> 00:06:06.930
transition.
 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.509
So the second functional type
here is transitional music.

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.442
We want to be able to
differentiate thematic music

00:06:14.442 --> 00:06:16.000
from transitional music.
 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.346
Then there are passages--and in
sonata-allegro form it's in the

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:23.747
middle of the movement--
that are exclusively

00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:26.725
developmental,
where you take the material and

00:06:26.725 --> 00:06:27.500
play with it.
 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.990
You could make it--expand it
and change it that way.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.415
You could shorten it as
Beethoven often does in working

00:06:32.415 --> 00:06:33.810
with just particular motives.
 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.709
It tends to sound very complex.
 

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:39.540
There's a lot going on in the
development section.

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.839
It's the most polyphonic,
the most contrapuntal--

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:45.490
counterpoint and
polyphony--sort of synonymous--

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:48.899
the most complex in terms of
the counterpoint and,

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:51.201
as we said before,
it tends to move around a lot

00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:53.791
because they pass--
the composers will pass through

00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:55.959
different keys in the
development section.

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:59.249
So we've got,
so far, three of what we call

00:06:59.249 --> 00:07:02.836
the four functional types--
or what I have called the four

00:07:02.836 --> 00:07:04.110
functional types:
thematic,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.149
transitional, developmental.
 

00:07:06.149 --> 00:07:08.709
And now we have to talk about
the last one,

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:11.449
which is the simplest in some
ways: cadential--

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:16.970
where the composer will just
throw on a lot of heavy,

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:22.660
simple harmonic motion to slow
the music down psychologically--

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:26.377
not the tempo actually--but
psychologically sort of bring it

00:07:26.377 --> 00:07:29.122
to a close,
so we can say a closing

00:07:29.122 --> 00:07:30.500
functional type.
 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.925
Again to review:
thematic, transitional,

00:07:33.925 --> 00:07:36.560
developmental and cadential.
 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.516
Those are our four functional
types that will show up with any

00:07:40.516 --> 00:07:42.591
movement of sonata-allegro form.
 

00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:43.370
Question.
 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.629
Student: What was the
last one?

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:47.139
Prof: Cadential,
with--was that it,

00:07:47.139 --> 00:07:47.384
Dan?
 

00:07:47.384 --> 00:07:48.117
It's Daniel.
 

00:07:48.117 --> 00:07:49.220
Is that right?
 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:49.529
Student: Yes.
 

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:49.870
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.060
Student: How do you
spell that?

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.764
Prof: Well,
just take cadence,

00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:58.983
c-a-d-e-n-c-e,
and turn it into cadential,

00:07:58.983 --> 00:08:00.220
t-i-a-l.
 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.406
I don't know if my spellchecker
kicks that word back or not,

00:08:03.406 --> 00:08:05.459
but we use that term in music a
lot.

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:07.485
"This was a cadential
gesture,"

00:08:07.485 --> 00:08:10.730
suggesting that we're kind of
getting to the end of something.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.389
So, remember we had cadence
being the end of a phrase.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:16.278
Well, it's just the end of the
section here.

00:08:16.278 --> 00:08:17.218
Any other questions?
 

00:08:17.218 --> 00:08:18.439
That was a good question.
 

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:18.932
All right.
 

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:21.939
So to get rolling with this,
let's listen to some music now.

00:08:21.939 --> 00:08:22.740
Enough talk from me.
 

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.389
Let's get--listen to some
music, and I'm going to play

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:27.875
four excerpts here--
mostly here again from

00:08:27.875 --> 00:08:39.285
Mozart--four excerpts--
and you see if you can identify

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:57.803
which of the functional types is
in play here &lt;&lt;music

00:08:57.803 --> 00:09:03.549
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:09:03.549 --> 00:09:05.720
Okay. We're going to stop there.
 

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.940
Let's review just for a moment.
 

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.558
How do you tell these
functional types?

00:09:08.558 --> 00:09:10.990
Well, what are you looking for
here, or listening for?

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.265
With thematic,
you want to be able to kind of

00:09:13.265 --> 00:09:16.317
sing it or you recognize it as
something that you could walk

00:09:16.317 --> 00:09:17.558
out of here humming.
 

00:09:17.558 --> 00:09:20.250
So something that's--that you
can sort of take with you.

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:23.042
Transitional:
this idea of a little bit

00:09:23.042 --> 00:09:25.320
unsettled and lots of motion.
 

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.235
Cadential--as I say,
that's probably the easiest

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:31.650
because &gt;
 

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:35.649
, something like that,
bringing it to an end.

00:09:35.649 --> 00:09:40.014
And developmental is going to
be rather complex--lots of

00:09:40.014 --> 00:09:41.918
counterpoint going on.
 

00:09:41.918 --> 00:09:43.279
So let's go back to the
beginning.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:50.440
 
 

00:09:50.440 --> 00:10:19.190
&gt;
 

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.379
Okay. So that's number one.
 

00:10:21.379 --> 00:10:37.610
Here's extract number two
&gt;

00:10:37.610 --> 00:11:06.820
and excerpt number three
&gt;

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:20.846
and number four.
 

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:47.149
&gt;
 

00:11:47.149 --> 00:11:48.649
All right. Let's go back now.
 

00:11:48.649 --> 00:11:50.701
Let's hear "one"
one more time and then we're

00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:53.094
going to ask for a volunteer to
take a stab at which of the four

00:11:53.094 --> 00:11:54.385
functional types you think this
is.

00:11:54.385 --> 00:11:54.576
Okay.
 

00:11:54.576 --> 00:11:55.830
Number one, one more time.
 

00:11:55.830 --> 00:12:24.058
&gt;
 

00:12:24.058 --> 00:12:29.669
So what brave soul will take
this one on?

00:12:29.669 --> 00:12:33.409
Sorry. Carolyn, please.
 

00:12:33.409 --> 00:12:35.250
Transitional.
 

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.970
That is correct.
 

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.200
Yes, that's correct.
 

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.080
Now what did you hear there?
 

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.326
It's hard to play the whole
thing again, but what were you

00:12:42.326 --> 00:12:42.759
thinking?
 

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:46.730
What came--what--why did you
jump to that conclusion?

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:52.019
Student:
&gt;

00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:53.062
Prof: Okay.
 

00:12:53.062 --> 00:12:55.610
At the end of it,
it did kind of slow down.

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.960
You had a sense of arrival
there.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:58.950
There was lots of motion.
 

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.309
There was lots of movement,
and then at the end a sense of

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:02.899
arrival.
 

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:03.427
All right.
 

00:13:03.427 --> 00:13:06.336
We've arrived at a new--and
probably a theme is going to

00:13:06.336 --> 00:13:07.658
come in at that point.
 

00:13:07.658 --> 00:13:09.950
So that is, in fact,
a transition.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.389
 
 

00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:19.235
&gt;
 

00:13:19.235 --> 00:13:22.577
What about that one?
 

00:13:22.577 --> 00:13:25.919
Frederick, go ahead.
 

00:13:25.919 --> 00:13:30.432
You had your hand up first.
 

00:13:30.432 --> 00:13:39.789
Student: That was the
cadential version because it

00:13:39.789 --> 00:13:44.284
seemed--
a lot of monotony,

00:13:44.284 --> 00:13:48.894
kind of, in the bass,
and it's really leaning to the

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:51.577
descending,
more the sequence of the melody

00:13:51.577 --> 00:13:55.029
and it's coming to a close in
&gt;.

00:13:55.029 --> 00:13:55.870
Prof: Okay.
 

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:58.350
Well, I think the key there is
it's very monotonous.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:59.610
You used the word
"monotonous."

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:06.178
It's very monotonous in the
bass, &gt;

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:09.240
or something like that as the
melody cascades down against it,

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.750
but listening to the bass there
you can tell the--

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.149
that's just a very monotonous
harmonic pattern.

00:14:14.149 --> 00:14:16.900
So harmonic patterns in
cadential passages

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.787
here--cadential functional
type--tend to be,

00:14:19.787 --> 00:14:22.070
as Frederick says,
monotonous.

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:22.577
Okay.
 

00:14:22.577 --> 00:14:25.929
Let's go on to number three
now.

00:14:25.929 --> 00:14:39.529
&gt;
 

00:14:39.529 --> 00:14:42.288
Let's just stop it right there
and queue that one again.

00:14:42.288 --> 00:14:43.759
So what do you think about
that?

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:44.470
Name, please?
 

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.940
Student: Roger.
 

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.827
Prof: Roger.
 

00:14:45.827 --> 00:14:46.061
Okay.
 

00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:46.950
Fire away, Roger.
 

00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:47.289
Student: I think that's
thematic.

00:14:47.289 --> 00:14:49.870
Prof: Thematic, right.
 

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:51.120
Can you sing it?
 

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.860
Play it again for Roger.
 

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:57.274
We're really putting Roger on
the spot here this morning but

00:14:57.274 --> 00:14:57.970
let's see.
 

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:11.279
You don't have to be--
&gt;

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:12.720
And I'll play at the piano.
 

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:16.259
&gt;
 

00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:16.490
Okay.
 

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.091
So that's it?
 

00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:17.322
Okay.
 

00:15:17.322 --> 00:15:19.399
Roger says I just played it
so--all right.

00:15:19.399 --> 00:15:21.220
So that is a melody.
 

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.350
And let's queue that again and
just while we're at this,

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.629
notice what Mozart does with
this melody after giving it to

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:29.730
us--
sort of does some very

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:31.408
interesting I think.
 

00:15:31.408 --> 00:15:35.019
So let's have the beginning of
that same number three again,

00:15:35.019 --> 00:15:35.570
please.
 

00:15:35.570 --> 00:15:37.913
&gt;
 

00:15:37.913 --> 00:15:41.549
So here's our lovely
melody--major or minor?

00:15:41.549 --> 00:15:47.168
Major: sweet, sounds delightful.
 

00:15:47.168 --> 00:15:52.056
Now watch what he does here,
just drops a third,

00:15:52.056 --> 00:15:55.279
&gt;
 

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:58.147
just a little twist in minor
there--same melody,

00:15:58.147 --> 00:16:01.259
but just lowering that third
degree of the scale.

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:01.702
Okay.
 

00:16:01.702 --> 00:16:06.490
So that's a good example of
thematic functional type.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.231
Here is extract number four.
 

00:16:08.231 --> 00:16:09.539
What about this one?
 

00:16:09.539 --> 00:16:47.308
&gt;
 

00:16:47.308 --> 00:16:50.082
Okay, and we'll just stop it
there and you can go on to the

00:16:50.082 --> 00:16:50.610
next one.
 

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:51.600
Well, what about that one?
 

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:56.019
Yeah, go for the obvious answer
here.

00:16:56.019 --> 00:16:58.350
It's going to be--name, please?
 

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.860
Lana. Well, I beg your pardon?
 

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:01.298
Student: Developmental.
 

00:17:01.298 --> 00:17:03.168
Prof: Developmental,
and why?

00:17:03.168 --> 00:17:05.592
What did you--well,
yeah, because it's the only one

00:17:05.592 --> 00:17:08.042
left,
etc., etc., but did you--could

00:17:08.042 --> 00:17:12.169
you tell us something that you
heard there that sort of backs

00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:15.470
that up or confirms that it is
developmental?

00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:17.118
Student: It has many
threads weaving in and out.

00:17:17.118 --> 00:17:20.157
Prof: Yeah,
many threads weaving in and

00:17:20.157 --> 00:17:21.913
out, &gt;
 

00:17:21.913 --> 00:17:25.222
, and somebody else is doing
&gt;

00:17:25.222 --> 00:17:28.126
, all sort of
simultaneously--many different

00:17:28.126 --> 00:17:32.111
ideas happening simultaneously,
typical of the complexity of

00:17:32.111 --> 00:17:34.339
the development section.
 

00:17:34.339 --> 00:17:35.769
We've got some on the tape here.
 

00:17:35.769 --> 00:17:37.685
We're not going to go through
them quite so slowly.

00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:38.529
Let's play one more.
 

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:40.289
It could be any one of the four.
 

00:17:40.289 --> 00:17:43.579
Here's another one, number five.
 

00:17:43.579 --> 00:18:06.680
&gt;
 

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.930
Okay.
 

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:13.920
Takers there?
 

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.170
Okay.
 

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:16.936
Name, please.
 

00:18:16.936 --> 00:18:20.539
I should know it--the young
lady right in front of Thaddeus.

00:18:20.539 --> 00:18:21.470
You had your hand up first.
 

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:22.450
Student: Oh--Mary Pat.
 

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:25.259
Prof: Mary Pat, okay.
 

00:18:25.259 --> 00:18:26.548
Student: Was that
transitional?

00:18:26.548 --> 00:18:28.527
Prof: It was
transitional and in just the one

00:18:28.527 --> 00:18:32.435
hearing that's awfully good,
but you could hear it kind of

00:18:32.435 --> 00:18:35.048
build &gt;
 

00:18:35.048 --> 00:18:38.810
and then it stopped as if it
had arrived at the end of the

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:40.970
transition;
the musical journey was over.

00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:42.730
So that was transitional.
 

00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:44.509
Here's another one.
 

00:18:44.509 --> 00:19:21.069
&gt;
 

00:19:21.069 --> 00:19:22.799
Takers there?
 

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:24.849
Thaddeus.
 

00:19:24.849 --> 00:19:25.660
Student: Developmental.
 

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:26.530
Prof: Okay.
 

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:27.548
It was developmental.
 

00:19:27.548 --> 00:19:28.130
Excellent.
 

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.259
And I guess once again lots of
things going on there.

00:19:31.259 --> 00:19:35.457
Probably developmental and
transitional may sound most

00:19:35.457 --> 00:19:36.250
similar.
 

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.219
They're probably the two that
are most difficult to

00:19:39.219 --> 00:19:40.170
differentiate.
 

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:42.308
Thematic, yeah,
you can kind of remember that

00:19:42.308 --> 00:19:44.597
as a melody;
cadential, probably pretty

00:19:44.597 --> 00:19:45.650
straightforward.
 

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:50.990
So there's a tendency with--to
confuse the transitional and the

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:52.368
developmental.
 

00:19:52.368 --> 00:19:54.846
It's just that there's
oftentimes with developmental a

00:19:54.846 --> 00:19:56.390
lot more counterpoint going on.
 

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.981
All right.
 

00:19:56.981 --> 00:19:59.589
One last one here and then
we'll stop this.

00:19:59.589 --> 00:20:39.328
&gt;
 

00:20:39.328 --> 00:20:42.904
So he's driving that sucker
into the ground with sort of a

00:20:42.904 --> 00:20:45.414
sledgehammer of a cadential
ending there.

00:20:45.414 --> 00:20:45.980
Okay?
 

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.038
So that should help you.
 

00:20:47.038 --> 00:20:50.144
When we get to sections this
week, we're going to be playing

00:20:50.144 --> 00:20:53.355
pieces and have you track along
where we are in sonata-allegro

00:20:53.355 --> 00:20:53.828
form.
 

00:20:53.828 --> 00:20:57.039
Let's turn our attention now,
unless there are questions.

00:20:57.039 --> 00:20:58.150
Any questions about that?
 

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:01.574
If not, let's turn our
attention now to theme and

00:21:01.574 --> 00:21:02.430
variation.
 

00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:04.157
We're moving on to theme and
variation form,

00:21:04.157 --> 00:21:06.690
which we will also need for our
concert a week from Saturday.

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.684
Here what we have is not this
sort of complex organic mixture

00:21:10.684 --> 00:21:13.065
of many different themes--
first theme,

00:21:13.065 --> 00:21:14.780
second theme,
concluding theme and things

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:15.338
like that.
 

00:21:15.338 --> 00:21:18.503
We have one theme,
usually-- usually just one

00:21:18.503 --> 00:21:19.079
theme.
 

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:20.528
And we will get that theme.
 

00:21:20.528 --> 00:21:23.900
And then we will get that theme
again with something changed.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.480
Then we will get that material
again with something changed.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.390
And again with something
changed.

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:32.917
So think of this as a kind of
series of boxcars on a railroad

00:21:32.917 --> 00:21:36.212
train or something like that--
units more or less the same

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:39.354
size, but each of those boxcars
is going to look a little bit

00:21:39.354 --> 00:21:42.652
different as it goes by because
it might have a little different

00:21:42.652 --> 00:21:45.846
logo on it or a little bit of
different ornamental material on

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:46.368
it.
 

00:21:46.368 --> 00:21:47.452
All right.
 

00:21:47.452 --> 00:21:50.700
So we're going to--let's see.
 

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:54.568
For time, maybe I'll--we'll not
do the Ives.

00:21:54.568 --> 00:21:56.805
We were going to--well,
maybe we will have a little bit

00:21:56.805 --> 00:21:57.220
of Ives.
 

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.969
Theme and variations:
again, it goes all the way back

00:22:00.969 --> 00:22:05.404
to the Middle Ages and it--
they tend to be written on

00:22:05.404 --> 00:22:09.492
rather simple themes,
particularly patriotic themes,

00:22:09.492 --> 00:22:11.365
maybe--
I was thinking about this the

00:22:11.365 --> 00:22:13.517
other day--
maybe because patriotic themes

00:22:13.517 --> 00:22:14.528
are pretty simple.
 

00:22:14.528 --> 00:22:18.551
So the simpler the theme,
the more likely that theme is

00:22:18.551 --> 00:22:22.650
to become the basis of a set of
theme and variations.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:26.970
Maybe it gives the composer
more freedom to pursue .

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.788
Now I think I brought in some
variations of Beethoven on

00:22:30.788 --> 00:22:33.009
"God Save the King."
 

00:22:33.009 --> 00:22:35.490
Yeah, here we go.
 

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:38.967
So here's Beethoven writing
"God Save the King"

00:22:38.967 --> 00:22:40.519
and here it starts out.
 

00:22:40.519 --> 00:22:42.890
&gt;.
 

00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:43.424
All right.
 

00:22:43.424 --> 00:22:44.710
So, a very simple tune.
 

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:46.910
And then he writes a set of
variations.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:48.289
Here's variation one.
 

00:22:48.289 --> 00:23:02.859
&gt;
 

00:23:02.859 --> 00:23:04.950
So there is that tune.
 

00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:07.499
Now in the late nineteen
thirty--twentieth

00:23:07.499 --> 00:23:10.794
century--Yale's own Charles
Ives--I think he was class

00:23:10.794 --> 00:23:12.099
of--anybody know?
 

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:16.759
Oh, 1898, something like that.
 

00:23:16.759 --> 00:23:19.905
He used to be the organist in
the First Church on the Green

00:23:19.905 --> 00:23:22.148
here,
so this is Yale's most famous

00:23:22.148 --> 00:23:25.443
classical composer--
wrote a set of variations on

00:23:25.443 --> 00:23:27.929
this same tune,
but they sound a little bit

00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:30.817
different because it's closer to
the modern period and they're

00:23:30.817 --> 00:23:32.240
performed here on an organ.
 

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.756
So Charles Ives,
"Variations on

00:23:33.756 --> 00:23:34.450
America."
 

00:23:34.450 --> 00:24:09.240
&gt;
 

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.380
Boy, talk about a long
reverberation time,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:16.517
how long it took that organ
sound to clear that church,

00:24:16.517 --> 00:24:17.130
huh?
 

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:21.022
So that was written right here
in New Haven by our own Charles

00:24:21.022 --> 00:24:21.470
Ives.
 

00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:25.420
But again the point is that
it's a very simple idea;

00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.538
it's a rather simple tune.
 

00:24:26.538 --> 00:24:29.118
Here's another simple tune that
Mozart used.

00:24:29.118 --> 00:24:31.906
Its original title was
"Variations on Ah!

00:24:31.906 --> 00:24:33.650
Vous Dirai-Je,
Maman,"

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.088
"Ah, let me tell you,
Mama."

00:24:36.088 --> 00:24:40.423
And it's the--it's a story of a
young woman who has gone to the

00:24:40.423 --> 00:24:42.311
big city and,
unfortunately,

00:24:42.311 --> 00:24:43.920
lost her virginity.
 

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:48.491
But we know this tune
not with that French text that

00:24:48.491 --> 00:24:52.039
Mozart first learned it with,
but this way.

00:24:52.039 --> 00:25:00.230
&gt;
 

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.560
Okay.
 

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.278
So that's the tune but it
originally was a kind of French

00:25:04.278 --> 00:25:08.660
popular song going back in--to
at least the eighteenth century.

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:12.470
How many different titles can
we give to this?

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:16.180
What do you know this as?
 

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.190
Student: "Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star."

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:18.440
Prof: "Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star."

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.430
Anything else?
 

00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:20.670
What?
 

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:21.288
Student: "Baa,
Baa, Black Sheep."

00:25:21.288 --> 00:25:22.680
Prof: "Baa,
Baa, Black Sheep."

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:25.117
Didn't "Sesame
Street" used to do- use

00:25:25.117 --> 00:25:26.674
letters with it,
"A, B, C,

00:25:26.674 --> 00:25:28.230
D," &gt;
 

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.009
and so on.
 

00:25:29.009 --> 00:25:32.470
So it's gotten a lot of its
traction over the years.

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:37.740
And here is the melody
&gt;

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.740
and here is the first variation.
 

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:43.088
Now my question to you is this:
with theme and variation,

00:25:43.088 --> 00:25:46.871
the composer can keep the theme
more or less exactly as it is

00:25:46.871 --> 00:25:49.140
and change the context around
it,

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.936
or he can change the theme--so
which does Mozart do in the

00:25:52.936 --> 00:25:54.470
first variation here?
 

00:25:54.470 --> 00:26:08.930
&gt;
 

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:09.890
Thoughts about that?
 

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.692
Is he changing the theme or is
he keeping the theme exactly the

00:26:13.692 --> 00:26:15.900
same and changing stuff around
it?

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:16.940
What do you think?
 

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.980
Well, what he's doing is
changing the theme.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.430
The theme would go
&gt;

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.540
but right at the beginning
instead of, I get &lt;&lt;plays

00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:27.358
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:26:27.358 --> 00:26:30.227
so there's only really one note
that's--that relates to the

00:26:30.227 --> 00:26:32.700
theme there and then
&gt;

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.750
well, now I get-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:38.224
So he's sort of changing the
theme by making the notes go

00:26:38.224 --> 00:26:42.073
quicker, and ornamenting around
those notes so that's variation

00:26:42.073 --> 00:26:42.569
one.
 

00:26:42.569 --> 00:26:44.220
Now what about variation two?
 

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.077
Has he changed the theme or
does he just change all the

00:26:47.077 --> 00:26:48.400
stuff around the theme?
 

00:26:48.400 --> 00:27:13.960
&gt;
 

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.460
And so on.
 

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.349
So what's he doing there?
 

00:27:16.349 --> 00:27:18.390
Carolyn.
 

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.798
Student:
&gt;

00:27:19.798 --> 00:27:20.723
Prof: Changing what?
 

00:27:20.723 --> 00:27:21.066
I'm sorry.
 

00:27:21.066 --> 00:27:21.818
I couldn't hear you.
 

00:27:21.818 --> 00:27:22.288
Student:
&gt;

00:27:22.288 --> 00:27:23.519
Prof: Changing the
context.

00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:27.074
The theme in the right hand
stays exactly &lt;&lt;plays

00:27:27.074 --> 00:27:27.930
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:28.720
the same.
 

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.730
Okay. Here is the next one.
 

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.279
&gt;
 

00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:35.640
What's that?
 

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.339
Well, it goes with this.
 

00:27:37.339 --> 00:27:49.519
&gt;
 

00:27:49.519 --> 00:27:51.548
So has he changed the theme?
 

00:27:51.548 --> 00:27:53.950
Yeah, he's changed the theme
rather considerably there.

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.650
Indeed, &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:59.506
we wouldn't know that that had
anything to do with

00:27:59.506 --> 00:28:01.838
"Twinkle,
Twinkle, Little Star"

00:28:01.838 --> 00:28:04.604
unless we had had--
given to us previously,

00:28:04.604 --> 00:28:05.923
as we have--
the melody.

00:28:05.923 --> 00:28:07.230
&gt;
 

00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:09.240
So we are hearing in our inner
ear.

00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:14.454
&gt;
 

00:28:14.454 --> 00:28:21.410
&gt;
 

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.910
So we know that's the basis of
this.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:26.278
And if he wants to deviate from
that we can still say,

00:28:26.278 --> 00:28:28.380
"Oh, yeah,
that's related to that."

00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.944
That's getting rather far away
from the original because we

00:28:31.944 --> 00:28:35.694
sort of locked in the original
in our mind--in our ear at that

00:28:35.694 --> 00:28:36.308
point.
 

00:28:36.308 --> 00:28:39.122
Here is--oh,
let's--yeah,

00:28:39.122 --> 00:28:41.700
let's skip that one.
 

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:42.490
We don't need to hear it.
 

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.750
What happens here?
 

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:50.338
Is the theme changed or is it
still there, and the context

00:28:50.338 --> 00:28:51.318
changed.
 

00:28:51.318 --> 00:28:54.769
And what rhythmic device is
Mozart using here?

00:28:54.769 --> 00:29:19.598
&gt;
 

00:29:19.598 --> 00:29:22.240
So did he change the theme
there?

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.221
Well, basically no,
except just a little bit

00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:29.369
because he was doing what to it?
 

00:29:29.369 --> 00:29:34.180
&gt;
 

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:37.640
Using syncopation--so he was
syncopating the theme.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.596
&gt;
 

00:29:39.596 --> 00:29:41.460
That kind of thing.
 

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.703
And he did one other little
fill-up here,

00:29:43.703 --> 00:29:45.893
if you will,
in what we might call the B

00:29:45.893 --> 00:29:47.240
section of the tune.
 

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.160
&gt;
 

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:54.058
The tune originally went
&gt;

00:29:54.058 --> 00:30:00.160
and now it's going
&gt;

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.859
and then &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:30:03.859 --> 00:30:05.259
So what's he done to the melody?
 

00:30:05.259 --> 00:30:07.210
Anybody hear that?
 

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.230
He went &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:12.400
Now it's going &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.150
Oscar.
 

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:15.088
Student:
&gt;

00:30:15.088 --> 00:30:16.159
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:30:16.159 --> 00:30:19.188
He has filled in the notes of a
diatonic major scale

00:30:19.188 --> 00:30:20.790
&gt;
 

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.930
with &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.616
the other notes--the
black-keyed notes--here,

00:30:25.616 --> 00:30:27.450
making it a chromatic scale.
 

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.180
So he's enriched it a little
bit by means of chromaticism.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:30.780
All right.
 

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.730
Let's go on to another
variation by Mozart here.

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.299
What's the texture of this
variation?

00:30:37.299 --> 00:31:09.190
&gt;
 

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.380
What do you think about the
texture of that?

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:15.690
Homophonic, monophonic,
or polyphonic?

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.338
Polyphonic, yeah.
 

00:31:17.338 --> 00:31:19.619
Was it imitative or
non-imitative?

00:31:19.619 --> 00:31:20.930
Here's the beginning.
 

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:26.740
&gt;
 

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:30.290
Imitative, right,
so this is actually a kind of

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.838
throwback to the sound of Bach.
 

00:31:32.838 --> 00:31:35.240
And this is what we will be
engaging when we come to the

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:35.588
fugue.
 

00:31:35.588 --> 00:31:39.481
It's las if Mozart's trying to
write in a fugal way here,

00:31:39.481 --> 00:31:41.220
with lots of imitation.
 

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:44.450
And what happened to the mode
in this variation?

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:47.140
&gt;
 

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:50.240
Well, he's running it up as a
scale--but what kind of scale?

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.950
Minor scale.
 

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:56.230
&gt;
 

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.938
Okay.
 

00:31:56.938 --> 00:32:02.318
And then, oddly,
the final variation.

00:32:02.318 --> 00:32:05.640
What does he do to the meter in
this last variation?

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:19.450
&gt;
 

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.838
What happens there?
 

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:24.012
We were going--
&gt;

00:32:24.012 --> 00:32:26.569
&gt;
 

00:32:26.569 --> 00:32:27.690
So what's he done to the meter?
 

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:40.038
Well, let me strip away the
bass-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:32:40.038 --> 00:32:43.980
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:49.568
He's changed it to triple by
throwing in an extra bar of

00:32:49.568 --> 00:32:54.650
filler in between each of his
basic duple beats.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:59.607
Then we come to,
maybe-- let me just cut to the

00:32:59.607 --> 00:33:01.009
chase here.
 

00:33:01.009 --> 00:33:10.488
At the end of this,
he's coming in-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:33:10.488 --> 00:33:13.390
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.579
What's this all the way to the
end now?

00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:16.900
What do we call this formally?
 

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:30.058
&gt;
 

00:33:30.058 --> 00:33:35.180
We talked about that with
regard to sonata-allegro form.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.803
It was one of the parts that
shows up also in sonata-allegro

00:33:37.803 --> 00:33:40.250
form--has nothing to do,
really, with the theme here.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:46.246
It is a good example of a coda,
right, just something thrown on

00:33:46.246 --> 00:33:52.630
at the end to say this is at the
end &gt;

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:53.480
--and what's he doing here?
 

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:53.920
What is this?
 

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.710
How complex is this?
 

00:33:55.710 --> 00:34:01.470
&gt;
 

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:05.920
It's just a major triad.
 

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.746
He's just ornamenting a major
triad so it's a good--more

00:34:08.746 --> 00:34:11.780
cadential stuff--sort of very
simple material at the end.

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.559
Okay. Our guest artist is here.
 

00:34:13.559 --> 00:34:14.059
I see him at the back.
 

00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:14.949
Kensho, come on up.
 

00:34:14.949 --> 00:34:17.731
We're going to do another piece
for you and we're going to talk

00:34:17.731 --> 00:34:20.380
about--a little bit about
Kensho, a very interesting guy.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.110
How many of you know Kensho
Watanabe?

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:23.989
Have you seen Kensho around?
 

00:34:23.989 --> 00:34:24.523
Okay.
 

00:34:24.523 --> 00:34:28.900
Who has seen Kensho and in what
context?

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.510
Student: He's in my
biochemistry class.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.945
Prof: Oh,
"he's in my biochemistry

00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:34.190
class." All right.
 

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:34.949
Yeah, cool.
 

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.750
So that means he does hardcore
sciences and you must too.

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:38.367
Good for you.
 

00:34:38.367 --> 00:34:40.268
You're better--a far better man
than I.

00:34:40.268 --> 00:34:41.161
All right.
 

00:34:41.161 --> 00:34:43.659
So yeah, hardcore sciences.
 

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:48.110
Anybody else know Kensho from
other contexts?

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:48.920
Yeah, Alana.
 

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.159
Student: He's in the YSO.
 

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.420
Prof: He's in the YSO.
 

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:52.869
What does he do in the YSO?
 

00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:56.268
Do you see him sitting all the
way at the back?

00:34:56.268 --> 00:34:57.070
Student:
&gt;

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:57.500
Prof: No.
 

00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.820
You see him sitting all the way
up at the front.

00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:00.710
He's the concert master of the
YSO.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:03.690
Anybody else know Kensho in a
different context?

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.519
Any members of Berkeley College
here?

00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:07.110
Anybody from Berkeley?
 

00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:09.190
Nobody from Berkeley?
 

00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:11.224
That's a statistical
improbability,

00:35:11.224 --> 00:35:14.576
but you're the conductor of
the--one of the conductors of

00:35:14.576 --> 00:35:16.431
the Berkeley Chamber Orchestra.
 

00:35:16.431 --> 00:35:16.791
Right?
 

00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:17.449
Yeah.
 

00:35:17.449 --> 00:35:20.340
So he's a conductor too,
which is kind of astonishing

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:23.230
because he's not--really not a
very good musician.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.469
He doesn't really know very
much about music.

00:35:25.469 --> 00:35:26.619
&gt;
 

00:35:26.619 --> 00:35:27.769
Kensho, what note is that?
 

00:35:27.769 --> 00:35:28.670
Kensho: I don't know--A?
 

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.179
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:35:29.179 --> 00:35:29.688
What note is this?
 

00:35:29.688 --> 00:35:30.510
&gt;
 

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.460
Kensho: F-sharp.
 

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:32.826
Prof: What note is this?
 

00:35:32.826 --> 00:35:34.059
&gt;
 

00:35:34.059 --> 00:35:35.099
Kensho: E and A.
 

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:37.889
Prof: Yeah. E and an A.
 

00:35:37.889 --> 00:35:41.215
You know that so he has a very
keen sense of absolute pitch,

00:35:41.215 --> 00:35:43.751
which really helps you out if
you're in music,

00:35:43.751 --> 00:35:44.880
needless to say.
 

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.650
We will be- we'll be talking
more about this.

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.891
One person in ten thousand has
this particular gift,

00:35:50.891 --> 00:35:53.880
statistically,
so he's a very impressive guy.

00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:57.898
And he's also in the five-year
M.A./B.A.

00:35:57.898 --> 00:35:58.722
program.
 

00:35:58.722 --> 00:35:59.650
Right?
 

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:00.699
Kensho: Yeah, the B.A.
 

00:36:00.699 --> 00:36:02.724
Prof: Yeah,
so at the end of four years

00:36:02.724 --> 00:36:05.514
here in addition to taking all
these heavy-duty science classes

00:36:05.514 --> 00:36:07.201
he's been--
crossed the street and he's

00:36:07.201 --> 00:36:07.949
going to get an M.A.
 

00:36:07.949 --> 00:36:09.000
in music at the same time.
 

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.579
I don't know.
 

00:36:09.579 --> 00:36:12.465
He was a couple minutes late
today and he said he hadn't got

00:36:12.465 --> 00:36:14.960
much sleep and I can sure as
heck understand why.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:15.530
All right.
 

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.380
So we have the--Kensho,
what are up to this year?

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.829
Everybody can come see you
on--what would that be?

00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:26.942
The 31^(st) of October ? Go--
Kensho:

00:36:26.942 --> 00:36:27.610
&gt;
 

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:29.670
Prof: Yeah,
yeah, so that you don't want to

00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.880
miss.
 

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.260
Right?
 

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:30.539
Kensho: Yeah.
 

00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:32.255
Prof: And you kind of
have to put that together and

00:36:32.255 --> 00:36:33.909
maybe that's why you haven't
been getting much sleep.

00:36:33.909 --> 00:36:37.210
So you're putting that together
and tell--

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:40.956
and I know that you've got a
concert coming up and if for

00:36:40.956 --> 00:36:43.597
some reason--
God forbid--we can't make it to

00:36:43.597 --> 00:36:46.494
our concert on the eighteenth,
our make-up concert could very

00:36:46.494 --> 00:36:47.900
well be the one on the
nineteenth.

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.239
Don't you have a concert on
the^( )nineteenth?

00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:50.304
Kensho: Yes,
we do.

00:36:50.304 --> 00:36:52.989
The Berkeley College Orchestra
will have their first concert.

00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:56.146
Prof: So if you want to
hear Kensho conduct,

00:36:56.146 --> 00:36:59.239
you could do that on the
nineteenth of October.

00:36:59.239 --> 00:36:59.663
All right.
 

00:36:59.663 --> 00:37:02.076
So we've got a piece here--and
I don't want to get too far

00:37:02.076 --> 00:37:02.500
behind.
 

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.849
It's a piece by Corelli.
 

00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:09.989
It's based on a melody and a
bass pattern--

00:37:09.989 --> 00:37:13.695
melody and a bass pattern--and
we'll play through little bits

00:37:13.695 --> 00:37:16.923
of it here,
and then we're going to play

00:37:16.923 --> 00:37:18.360
the whole thing.
 

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.916
Do we need to tune again?
 

00:37:19.916 --> 00:37:21.099
What do you think?
 

00:37:21.099 --> 00:37:21.320
Kensho: Yeah.
 

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.610
Prof: Yeah. Okay.
 

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:30.016
&gt;
 

00:37:30.016 --> 00:37:38.518
&gt;
 

00:37:38.518 --> 00:37:38.831
Okay.
 

00:37:38.831 --> 00:37:42.757
We've tuned the four strings of
the violin and we'll play just a

00:37:42.757 --> 00:37:43.630
little bit.
 

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.210
We're going to take this
section by section.

00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:47.047
Jacob here, he's going to point
things out as we go along a

00:37:47.047 --> 00:37:47.460
little bit.
 

00:37:47.460 --> 00:38:12.880
&gt;
 

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.260
Okay. That's the melody.
 

00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.559
Isn't that the most gorgeous
sound you've ever heard in your

00:38:16.559 --> 00:38:17.590
whole--
it's amazing,

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:20.735
but do you have any idea how
long it takes to produce a sound

00:38:20.735 --> 00:38:23.804
like that,
how many years of just sitting

00:38:23.804 --> 00:38:24.349
there?
 

00:38:24.349 --> 00:38:26.199
When did you start playing the
violin, Kensho?

00:38:26.199 --> 00:38:27.670
Kensho: I started when I
was almost three--

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:29.500
Prof: Almost three--so
you were a late bloomer,

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:29.672
then.
 

00:38:29.672 --> 00:38:30.431
&gt;
 

00:38:30.431 --> 00:38:31.400
&gt;
 

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.197
And you were probably so busy
with other things--but when you

00:38:35.197 --> 00:38:39.059
were really focusing exclusively
on this, how many hours a day

00:38:39.059 --> 00:38:40.389
did you practice?
 

00:38:40.389 --> 00:38:42.393
Kensho: When I was
really focusing,

00:38:42.393 --> 00:38:43.809
probably three hours a day.
 

00:38:43.809 --> 00:38:45.460
Prof: The max--three
hours.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.181
Then --if you were going
conservatory--it's because you

00:38:47.181 --> 00:38:48.489
got so many other demands on
your time.

00:38:48.489 --> 00:38:50.329
Are you playing any solos
around here this year?

00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:51.739
I should have asked that
question.

00:38:51.739 --> 00:38:52.717
Kensho: Not so much--.
 

00:38:52.717 --> 00:38:54.469
Prof: That's--
Kensho: --recital second

00:38:54.469 --> 00:38:55.931
semester but--
Prof: All right.

00:38:55.931 --> 00:38:57.110
We'll keep our eye out for
that.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:57.721
All right.
 

00:38:57.721 --> 00:39:00.717
So that's the theme and then
on--in variation two,

00:39:00.717 --> 00:39:03.773
the piano will play the
&gt;

00:39:03.773 --> 00:39:06.768
downbeat, and the violin plays
off the beat.

00:39:06.768 --> 00:39:08.586
I think for reasons of time,
we won't do that one though,

00:39:08.586 --> 00:39:08.880
Kensho.
 

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.068
Let's go to the number three
where we get a good example of

00:39:13.068 --> 00:39:16.969
staccato in the music--sort of
short, pointed notes.

00:39:16.969 --> 00:39:30.739
&gt;
 

00:39:30.739 --> 00:39:32.489
Okay. So we'll stop there.
 

00:39:32.489 --> 00:39:36.978
So when you hear Kensho playing
staccato then you know that we

00:39:36.978 --> 00:39:38.820
are in variation three.
 

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.706
Variation four,
we've got--he's playing

00:39:42.706 --> 00:39:46.664
sixteenth notes,
so it's going to go fairly fast

00:39:46.664 --> 00:39:49.144
here,
I guess--or maybe not--but he's

00:39:49.144 --> 00:39:51.760
got a lot to do here in
variation four.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:40:08.150
&gt;
 

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.476
Okay.
 

00:40:08.476 --> 00:40:12.018
So he's really--this is going
to be a workout for me.

00:40:12.018 --> 00:40:13.789
I hope I can keep up with this
lad today.

00:40:13.789 --> 00:40:14.420
All right.
 

00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:18.137
Then, yes, the one that sort of
scares me is variation five,

00:40:18.137 --> 00:40:21.793
because then he plays the theme
and I have all of this fast

00:40:21.793 --> 00:40:23.179
stuff underneath.
 

00:40:23.179 --> 00:40:24.849
Let's just do a little bit of
that.

00:40:24.849 --> 00:40:40.420
&gt;
 

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:40.775
Okay.
 

00:40:40.775 --> 00:40:44.630
So that's how that--has a
lovely, lovely theme there.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:49.458
Now number six is sort of fun
because the interest here is in

00:40:49.458 --> 00:40:51.389
the bass of the piano.
 

00:40:51.389 --> 00:40:54.090
It's a good example of
something we'll be talking a lot

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:55.889
about in our course:
walking bass.

00:40:55.889 --> 00:41:00.293
So the notes are all for the
most part contiguous and they

00:41:00.293 --> 00:41:04.543
all come in the same note
value--in this case the eighth

00:41:04.543 --> 00:41:05.239
note.
 

00:41:05.239 --> 00:41:10.530
So the--here is the beat and
the-- &lt;&lt;plays

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:12.219
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:15.800
and then he plays the melody
against that.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.536
In number seven,
we have the violin playing

00:41:20.536 --> 00:41:21.889
arpeggios.
 

00:41:21.889 --> 00:41:22.969
We've talked about that.
 

00:41:22.969 --> 00:41:25.289
So here are some arpeggios in
the violin.

00:41:25.289 --> 00:41:37.239
&gt;
 

00:41:37.239 --> 00:41:37.668
Okay.
 

00:41:37.668 --> 00:41:40.590
That'll give you a sense of
that.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:44.143
Number eight is a tricky one
for us, the--keeping it

00:41:44.143 --> 00:41:47.139
together--because of the triplet
pattern.

00:41:47.139 --> 00:41:48.659
So let's do a little bit with
that.

00:41:48.659 --> 00:42:12.489
&gt;
 

00:42:12.489 --> 00:42:15.119
And then nine we have sort of
an interlude.

00:42:15.119 --> 00:42:16.650
It's like a transition.
 

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:20.289
Ten we're not going to do
anything with right now.

00:42:20.289 --> 00:42:24.349
The violin plays harmony while
there's a kind of fast pattern

00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:25.230
underneath.
 

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:28.742
Eleven there's a lot of--oh,
eleven is sort of my favorite

00:42:28.742 --> 00:42:32.623
but it's a tricky one because of
the syncopation between the two

00:42:32.623 --> 00:42:33.610
instruments.
 

00:42:33.610 --> 00:43:00.179
&gt;
 

00:43:00.179 --> 00:43:01.440
So that's kind of a fun one.
 

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.989
And let's see.
 

00:43:03.989 --> 00:43:07.159
We need to tell them also--I
like--

00:43:07.159 --> 00:43:10.297
Maybe number thirteen is really
my favorite 'cause I got a very

00:43:10.297 --> 00:43:12.980
simple theme to play and he has
to work like crazy.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.159
And toward the end of that he's
playing triple stops.

00:43:16.159 --> 00:43:19.210
It's not that the violin just
plays one line.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:21.829
The violin can play two notes
at the same time,

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:23.190
it can play three notes at the
same time,

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:26.409
and if you really rip across
and shift quickly or just move

00:43:26.409 --> 00:43:29.242
your bow quickly across the
strings you can give the

00:43:29.242 --> 00:43:32.181
impression of four pitches,
but they-- all four have to be

00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:34.271
in tune so you got to have four
fingers usually in four

00:43:34.271 --> 00:43:35.860
different spots and that's hard
to do.

00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.096
Do you want to play a quadruple
stop for them there just

00:43:38.096 --> 00:43:38.949
to--anywhere,
or--

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:41.050
Kensho: Yeah.
 

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:45.659
&gt;
 

00:43:45.659 --> 00:43:47.746
Prof: So when you hear
those chords,

00:43:47.746 --> 00:43:50.481
a violin playing chords,
well, that's easy--on the piano

00:43:50.481 --> 00:43:51.824
&gt;
 

00:43:51.824 --> 00:43:54.309
or whatever it is &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:55.880
--that's easy on the piano.
 

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.815
That's hard on these string
instruments 'cause you've got to

00:43:58.815 --> 00:44:01.750
get four different fingers in
four different spots there.

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:04.634
Each of those notes has to be
adjusted just--fractionally just

00:44:04.634 --> 00:44:06.099
right for it to stay in tune.
 

00:44:06.099 --> 00:44:07.717
When he does it,
you think it's very simple,

00:44:07.717 --> 00:44:08.469
right, easy to do.
 

00:44:08.469 --> 00:44:11.480
It takes years to be able to do
that.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.070
Questions before we launch in
to this?

00:44:14.070 --> 00:44:16.750
Any questions?
 

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:18.590
So we're going to do the whole
thing for you.

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:19.463
Now be patient.
 

00:44:19.463 --> 00:44:22.431
We're going to run over just a
little bit today but,

00:44:22.431 --> 00:44:25.750
believe me, the--particularly
the end--you'll like it.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:29.630
So, Kensho Watanabe playing
theme and variations on

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:33.280
Corelli's tune and bass "La
Folia."

00:44:33.280 --> 00:49:59.250
&gt;
 

00:49:59.250 --> 00:49:59.541
Sorry.
 

00:49:59.541 --> 00:50:01.920
We had the wrong page up here
and I was filling.

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.489
Sorry.
 

00:50:03.489 --> 00:50:06.909
Okay. I think we need--okay.
 

00:50:06.909 --> 00:50:08.030
Now we are back to it.
 

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:09.280
It must be--I had the wrong
page.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.760
I'm sorry.
 

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:15.889
&gt;
 

00:50:15.889 --> 00:50:16.228
Sorry.
 

00:50:16.228 --> 00:50:18.320
We still don't have--I'm very
sorry.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.300
We found it. Okay.
 

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:26.132
We have--just have all these
pages and they go awry

00:50:26.132 --> 00:50:27.300
sometimes.
 

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:28.000
Sorry.
 

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.050
Okay.
 

00:50:29.050 --> 00:52:30.150
&gt;
 

00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:43.840
Bravo.
 

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.309
Thanks so much Kensho,
it's a great treat for me just

00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:49.579
to be able to play with the guy.
 

00:52:49.579 --> 00:52:51.469
I mean, what a luxury.
 

00:52:51.469 --> 00:52:53.230
Thank you so much,
thank you so much.

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:54.929
Beautiful, beautiful music.
 

00:52:54.929 --> 00:53:00.000

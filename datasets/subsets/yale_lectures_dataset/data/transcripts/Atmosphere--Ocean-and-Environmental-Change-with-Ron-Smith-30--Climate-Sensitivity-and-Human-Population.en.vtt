00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.833
RONALD SMITH: Yeah, so
this is a long list of things

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.733
that one might do to reduce
global warming.

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.633
But they're all very difficult,
if not impossible.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:18.067
So are there any points that you
want to make about these?

00:00:18.067 --> 00:00:20.467
Any questions about what
I mean by them?

00:00:20.467 --> 00:00:21.967
I think we did go
over this last

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:24.000
time, if I'm not mistaken.

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:31.000
There are lots of other
recommendations or suggestions

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.767
that have been made under
the general title of

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:35.967
geoengineering.

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:41.800
But one I indicated there is
to install an umbrella-like

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.567
object out in space, somewhere
between the earth and the sun,

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:51.700
so that it casts a shadow
on the earth.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.667
And, therefore, reduces the
total amount of sunlight

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:57.233
hitting the earth.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:01.067
A related suggestion is that
we put a layer of small

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:06.167
particles, kind of like
volcanoes have done naturally

00:01:06.167 --> 00:01:09.767
from time to time, put a layer
of small particles in the

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:13.433
stratosphere that will increase
the albedo of the

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:17.900
earth and reflect the Sun's
radiation back into space, and

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.933
thereby cool the earth.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:23.533
The question for something like
that, though, is what

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:25.500
material do we put in there?

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.067
They would have to be very fine
particles or they would

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:31.000
just fall out.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.733
If they have some kind of weird
chemistry, like sulfate

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:37.600
particles, what would they do
to the chemistry of the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:38.167
atmosphere?

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:41.967
So whenever you think of
something, some little clever

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:45.700
idea pops into your mind,
unfortunately there's probably

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.167
100 unintended consequences on
these geoengineering ideas.

00:01:51.167 --> 00:01:54.000
So they have to be thought
through extremely carefully

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.700
before any of them could
be implemented.

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:09.400
While climate research is quite
a mature area now, there

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.567
are some areas within it that
require further thought.

00:02:13.567 --> 00:02:17.500
For example, we're still missing
a complete theory of

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.667
the ice ages.

00:02:18.667 --> 00:02:22.133
We think that maybe this
Milankovitch forcing has

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:22.767
played a role.

00:02:22.767 --> 00:02:27.900
But that Milankovitch forcing
is very weak actually.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.300
The obliquity change, the tilt
of the earth's axis, is only a

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.000
couple of degrees one
way or the other.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.700
The procession theory, which
changes the orientation of the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.967
tilt of the earth's axis,
changes the way the seasons

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:46.300
work, but oppositely in
the two hemispheres.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.000
So if you're looking globally,
that influence cancels right

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.467
out completely.

00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:53.567
So you have to make up some
argument about why one

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.933
hemisphere is more important
than the other.

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:58.133
So we're missing a complete
theory there.

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:02.533
We're also missing a theory
of Venus' climate history.

00:03:02.533 --> 00:03:06.033
How it got from being an
earth-like planet to something

00:03:06.033 --> 00:03:07.800
that's much, much hotter.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.733
And that's important, as I
mentioned, because there's

00:03:10.733 --> 00:03:14.800
some worry that the earth's
atmosphere might follow a

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.167
similar path.

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:20.500
Theory of solar variability, now
we know that the sun has

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.033
gotten hotter over the
millennia, over

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:28.233
the age of the earth.

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:32.133
And we know that there's a
sunspot cycle, an 11 year and

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:36.000
a 22 year cycle, on the number
of sun spots on the

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.100
surface of the Sun.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.333
And we think that that may
have had a very minor

00:03:40.333 --> 00:03:44.167
influence on the amount of
radiation reaching the earth.

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:47.300
But that theory is not
well fleshed out.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.600
There are some statistical
relationships

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.900
that have been proposed.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.800
But the physical mechanisms for
this make almost no sense.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.567
And so we need to further
understand why the sun might

00:04:00.567 --> 00:04:03.433
vary in its strength and
what influence that

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:05.767
would have on the earth.

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:07.733
The theory of positive feedback
I'm going to be

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:09.867
talking more about that
in just a minute--

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:13.700
the idea that there are these
processes on earth that will

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.033
tend to amplify climate
change.

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:18.700
The ones that we've talked about
already have been ice

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.033
albedo feedback.

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:21.167
Right?

00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:25.067
More snow in a colder climate
makes the albedo larger,

00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:29.500
reflects more radiation, cools
the earth more, and that might

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.667
spiral on itself.

00:04:31.667 --> 00:04:34.267
There's the water
vapor feedback.

00:04:34.267 --> 00:04:37.967
A warmer climate would put
more water vapor in the

00:04:37.967 --> 00:04:39.667
atmosphere certainly.

00:04:39.667 --> 00:04:42.600
Water vapor is an important
greenhouse gas that would warm

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.900
the climate further and so on.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.700
And then one that's been talked
about more recently,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.100
seems to be going on with the
last 100 years or so, is

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:59.233
carbon dioxide feedback, where
a warmer climate is beginning

00:04:59.233 --> 00:05:05.700
to allow carbon trapped in
permafrost to decay and be

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.033
added to the atmosphere.

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:12.000
Also ocean water, when you
heat it, it can hold less

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.867
carbon dioxide dissolved
in water.

00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:17.667
So that CO2 is going
to be added.

00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:20.833
So this acts on a slower time
scale perhaps, but there's

00:05:20.833 --> 00:05:24.533
some worry that there's a carbon
dioxide feedback that

00:05:24.533 --> 00:05:26.833
may be starting to happen.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.700
That one has to do--that last
one has to do with this next

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.767
one, how greenhouse
concentrations are controlled.

00:05:35.767 --> 00:05:37.967
We don't have a complete
understanding

00:05:37.967 --> 00:05:38.967
of the carbon cycle.

00:05:38.967 --> 00:05:43.567
Or how some of the other
greenhouse gases, like

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:50.300
methane, ozone, oxides of
nitrogen there's not a

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.467
complete understanding of how
they are controlled in the

00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:54.733
earth's atmosphere.

00:05:54.733 --> 00:05:58.467
The last IPPC report, the one
that you've been looking at,

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:05.900
the AR4, is full of apologies
for how little they can say

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.033
about regional climates.

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:13.967
The problem is that these global
climate models roughly

00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:17.933
agree in their predictions of
how the global temperature

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:18.400
will change.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:22.367
But they disagree, to a large
extent, about how the climates

00:06:22.367 --> 00:06:25.167
of different continents and
different sub regions within

00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:27.167
continents will change.

00:06:27.167 --> 00:06:29.100
So this is a big area
of research.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.800
In fact, my group is interested
a little bit in how

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.667
global changes will influence
local and regional climates.

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:41.833
We don't understand very well
how clouds would change,

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:45.300
aerosols, how those two things
would impact the earth's

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.133
albedo in a different climate.

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:50.867
And this question of whether we
can re-bury carbon dioxide

00:06:50.867 --> 00:06:54.000
into the earth is receiving a
lot of funding and a lot of

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.233
research at the moment.

00:06:56.233 --> 00:06:58.033
Those are some of the
active areas.

00:06:58.033 --> 00:07:02.933
If any of you were to get
involved in climate research,

00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:05.700
there's a good chance you'd
probably be working on one of

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.667
those problems. Although, maybe
I've left off a couple

00:07:08.667 --> 00:07:10.767
of newly emerging ideas.

00:07:13.767 --> 00:07:17.000
So the last thing I want to
talk about in this set of

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
lectures is something called
climate sensitivity.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:28.467
And it's basically an attempt
to simplify and quantify how

00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:32.167
earth will respond, how the
earth's climate will respond,

00:07:32.167 --> 00:07:35.367
to changes in radiative
forcing.

00:07:38.067 --> 00:07:42.267
I'll define radiative forcing
in just a minute.

00:07:42.267 --> 00:07:48.800
There are two different common
definitions for climate

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.600
sensitivity.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.400
So I need you to be aware
of both of these.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.633
So when you pick up a paper on
climate sensitivity you can

00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:59.533
spot which definition
the author is using.

00:07:59.533 --> 00:08:04.300
One definition is, how much
would the earth's climate warm

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:07.800
if there was a doubling
of CO2?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.567
That's a commonly used
definition for climate

00:08:10.567 --> 00:08:11.867
sensitivity.

00:08:11.867 --> 00:08:15.000
The other one is, how much would
the earth warm if you

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.033
increased the radiation hitting
the surface of the

00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:24.333
earth by one watt per
square meter?

00:08:24.333 --> 00:08:28.633
Now these two things can be
related, roughly, because a

00:08:28.633 --> 00:08:33.233
CO2 doubling when you add CO2 to
the atmosphere you increase

00:08:33.233 --> 00:08:35.100
the absorption and the

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.533
re-emission of longwave
radiation.

00:08:38.533 --> 00:08:45.000
And a doubling of the CO2 is
approximately adding 3.7 watts

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.567
per square meter of radiative
forcing back to the

00:08:48.567 --> 00:08:50.100
surface of the earth.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:53.400
So you trap the outgoing
longwave radiation, you warm

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:56.233
the atmosphere, and then
that readmits back to

00:08:56.233 --> 00:08:58.933
earth about that much.

00:08:58.933 --> 00:09:02.300
So you can go back and forth
between those two definitions

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.800
using that kind of relationship,
that quantity.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.000
Now the reason I like it, the
reason I want to stick it in

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.600
here, is that it's being used
more and more as a compact way

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.333
to compare different models.

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:18.200
For example, the National
Center for Atmospheric

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.600
Research has a global
climate model.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.367
The Department of Energy has
a global climate model.

00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:26.867
NASA has a global
climate model.

00:09:26.867 --> 00:09:32.033
Several in Europe, the
Russians have one.

00:09:32.033 --> 00:09:33.067
How do you compare them?

00:09:33.067 --> 00:09:39.233
One way is to use this measure
of their sensitivity.

00:09:39.233 --> 00:09:42.000
It's been found in that way
that there are some

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.267
significant differences
between these models.

00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:46.667
And it's been a help to
find out why these

00:09:46.667 --> 00:09:49.200
models are so different.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.467
Also, it's a nice way to
summarize some paleoclimate

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:56.700
data of the type that you and
I have been looking at a

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.833
couple of weeks ago.

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:02.333
And I like it because it
illustrates the role of these

00:10:02.333 --> 00:10:03.233
climate feedbacks.

00:10:03.233 --> 00:10:06.300
So it turns out that these
climate sensitivity values,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.333
almost no matter how you compute
them, are larger than

00:10:11.333 --> 00:10:16.200
you would expect if you left
off the feedbacks.

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.500
And so by that increase in
sensitivity you can show what

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.633
role these climate feedbacks
are having.

00:10:22.633 --> 00:10:25.833
So for all these reasons,
we're going to

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:26.700
take a look at this.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:28.967
Now, so the definitions.

00:10:28.967 --> 00:10:31.500
Radiative forcing, extra
radiation at the earth's

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.100
surface relative to
preindustrial time.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.533
That's the way radiative forcing
is defined in the

00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:39.367
global warming debate.

00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:41.967
I wouldn't call that a
universal definition.

00:10:41.967 --> 00:10:43.100
But in the global
warming debate

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.600
that's how it's defined.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.533
These are the primary feedbacks
we're talking about.

00:10:47.533 --> 00:10:51.733
And occasionally you'll find
a discussion of a runaway

00:10:51.733 --> 00:10:55.067
climate where the feedbacks, the
positive feedbacks, are so

00:10:55.067 --> 00:10:58.567
strong that they would take over
and drive the climate to

00:10:58.567 --> 00:11:02.467
an extreme state, like has
happened on Venus.

00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:05.600
Unlikely for earth, but it's
part of the conversation.

00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:17.833
I've got to define okay, now
there's another variable that

00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:22.467
comes in, in how you define
climate sensitivity.

00:11:22.467 --> 00:11:25.167
And that has to do with, what
feedbacks do you include in

00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:27.100
the calculation?

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.567
So I'm going to define something
called the Black

00:11:29.567 --> 00:11:34.233
Body sensitivity, which has
no feedbacks in it.

00:11:34.233 --> 00:11:36.733
It's based on the
Stefan-Boltzmann law only,

00:11:36.733 --> 00:11:40.200
which you remember, from earlier
in the course, is the

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.733
fact that the radiation emitted
from an object's

00:11:43.733 --> 00:11:48.833
surface goes like the fourth
power of the temperature.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:50.100
That was the Stefan-Boltzmann
law.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.667
There's something called the
Charney sensitivity.

00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:59.600
Charney was a scientist
who chaired the first

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.967
investigative panel
on global warming.

00:12:02.967 --> 00:12:08.400
And he tried to base their final
report on a particular

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:12.933
definition of climate
sensitivity that included some

00:12:12.933 --> 00:12:16.967
short-term feedbacks,
but excluded some of

00:12:16.967 --> 00:12:18.067
the longer term ones.

00:12:18.067 --> 00:12:21.433
For example, he included water
vapor feedbacks, snow/albedo

00:12:21.433 --> 00:12:23.500
feedback, and cloud feedback.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:28.833
But he excluded any feedback
connected with the oceans, the

00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:31.867
ice sheets, or carbon
dioxide changes.

00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:35.200
And that's become known, in
the literature, as Charney

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.200
sensitivity.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:45.667
It's probably valid on periods
of time of, say, well 20 to 50

00:12:45.667 --> 00:12:49.600
years, something like that.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.067
When you go to longer terms,
however, maybe 100, 200, 300

00:12:53.067 --> 00:12:57.333
years, you have to realize that
other slower adjustments

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:01.300
in the climate system are going
to be happening, such as

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.133
changes to deep ocean
temperature, changes in the

00:13:05.133 --> 00:13:06.200
ice sheets.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.467
Sea level will be rising.

00:13:08.467 --> 00:13:11.267
Biomass on the continents
may be changing.

00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:17.867
And the carbon dioxide may be
responding to changes in the

00:13:17.867 --> 00:13:21.733
ocean and the land surface,
the land biomass.

00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:24.100
So that would be called
long-term sensitivity.

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:32.700
Makes you realize this subject
is not dirt simple.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:35.900
I mean, it's got some complexity
to it, depending on

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.300
the time frame that you're
talking about and the

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.467
feedbacks that you're allowing
in the calculation.

00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:45.267
So here's the easy one, Black
Body sensitivity.

00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:50.533
If I've got an object, like a
planet, receiving a certain

00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:54.400
amount of radiation from the
sun, you know that it'll

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.567
increase its temperature, or
adjust its temperature, so

00:13:58.567 --> 00:14:03.767
that it radiates to space
just as much as it's

00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:05.733
receiving from the sun.

00:14:05.733 --> 00:14:09.167
So it'll adjust it's own
temperature to come into that

00:14:09.167 --> 00:14:11.667
kind of radiative equilibrium.

00:14:11.667 --> 00:14:14.767
Well then, if I were to increase
the amount received

00:14:14.767 --> 00:14:20.067
from the sun by 1 watt per
square meter, how much must

00:14:20.067 --> 00:14:23.200
the temperature rise in order
to establish a new

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.100
equilibrium?

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.667
Pretty simple idea, right?

00:14:26.667 --> 00:14:29.933
So there's the Stefan-Boltzmann
law.

00:14:29.933 --> 00:14:33.267
I'm going to do a quick little
calculus trick here that some

00:14:33.267 --> 00:14:34.733
of you may not be
familiar with.

00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:37.667
But if I take the derivative
of F with respect to

00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:41.067
temperature, I get 4 times sigma
T to the third times the

00:14:41.067 --> 00:14:43.233
change in temperature.

00:14:43.233 --> 00:14:48.767
And if I rearrange, bring the
dF under and that down under

00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:50.900
here, I get that formula.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:57.267
The change in temperature for
each change in flux is given

00:14:57.267 --> 00:15:02.367
by 1 over 4 sigma
T to the third.

00:15:02.367 --> 00:15:03.467
I can plug numbers in.

00:15:03.467 --> 00:15:05.967
That Stefan-Boltzmann constant
is a fixed constant.

00:15:05.967 --> 00:15:10.633
I can use the temperature of
our planet, of 288 Kelvin,

00:15:10.633 --> 00:15:12.700
plug it into that formula.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.967
And I immediately get this
rather interesting number.

00:15:16.967 --> 00:15:21.500
For every watt per square meter
that I add to the earth

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:28.300
in the form of radiative energy,
it'll warm by 0.2

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.100
degrees Kelvin.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:38.133
That is the simplest way to
compute climate sensitivity.

00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:41.300
That's a pretty small number.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.567
And the reason why, as we will
see the reason why it's fairly

00:15:44.567 --> 00:15:46.400
small is we have not
included any of

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.667
these positive feedbacks.

00:15:51.467 --> 00:15:55.100
Now this is a calculation
you can do for yourself.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:00.833
Just try putting in different
values of F or T and computing

00:16:00.833 --> 00:16:05.267
it and you'll see that that is
the rate at which the two

00:16:05.267 --> 00:16:07.767
things are--the slope at which
the two things are related to

00:16:07.767 --> 00:16:09.333
each other.

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:11.800
Any questions on that?

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:17.200
So we use this value as kind
of our foundation, right?

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.600
Now, if you look at the IPCC
report let me get the lights

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:29.400
down this summarizes the
radiative forcing, using the

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.167
definition that I gave
a moment ago.

00:16:31.167 --> 00:16:36.067
This is since the beginning of
the industrial revolution.

00:16:36.067 --> 00:16:39.867
It shows how much the radiation
reaching the surface

00:16:39.867 --> 00:16:44.367
of the earth has changed
and for what reason.

00:16:44.367 --> 00:16:48.000
Carbon dioxide is the
biggest reason.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.500
That increase in carbon dioxide,
we've seen, caused

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:59.333
about 1.7 watts per square meter
added greenhouse forcing

00:16:59.333 --> 00:17:00.767
at the surface of the earth.

00:17:00.767 --> 00:17:05.100
However, methane, N2O, and the
halocarbons have added

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.200
something too.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.133
Tropospheric ozone
has added more.

00:17:11.133 --> 00:17:13.867
And then on the negative side
and I talked about this a

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:19.200
couple days ago aerosols, mostly
sulfate aerosols from

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.533
coal burning, has had
a negative effect.

00:17:23.533 --> 00:17:27.667
Well when you add all these
together, these

00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:28.933
roughly cancel these.

00:17:28.933 --> 00:17:31.667
And you get a value that's
about what CO2 would

00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:33.167
have been by itself.

00:17:33.167 --> 00:17:37.567
That doesn't mean that CO2
is alone in importance.

00:17:37.567 --> 00:17:38.567
The others are important too.

00:17:38.567 --> 00:17:41.700
But generally these cancel those
and you get a value of

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:47.733
about 1 and 1/2 meters
per second for

00:17:47.733 --> 00:17:49.167
the radiative forcing.

00:17:49.167 --> 00:17:53.900
And so if you then just use the
Black Body sensitivity for

00:17:53.900 --> 00:18:00.267
that, that would give
you about 0.3

00:18:00.267 --> 00:18:03.833
degree Kelvin warming.

00:18:03.833 --> 00:18:07.300
And we know, in fact, from our
data, that the warming of our

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.100
planet since the industrial
revolution began is about 0.8.

00:18:13.833 --> 00:18:16.733
So it's quite a bit larger
than this value.

00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:19.600
We can formalize that.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:23.967
So let's try to compute
radiative forcing based on the

00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:26.600
data that we have.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:31.533
Over the last 100 years we've
had about 0.8 degree warming.

00:18:31.533 --> 00:18:35.500
From the last slide, we've got
about 1.5 watts per square

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.000
meter radiative forcing.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.667
So if I divide one by the other,
I get a sensitivity

00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:47.067
based on the radiation
definition of 0.5 Kelvin.

00:18:47.067 --> 00:18:56.567
That then is about 2 and 1/2
times the sensitivity there.

00:18:56.567 --> 00:19:02.667
So the sensitivity that we're
seeing in our planet is about

00:19:02.667 --> 00:19:05.167
2 and 1/2 times what we compute
from a simple Black

00:19:05.167 --> 00:19:06.567
Body forcing law.

00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:10.133
This then, is evidence that the
feedbacks are working, the

00:19:10.133 --> 00:19:13.700
positive feedbacks
are working.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.200
You could re-formula that as
a warming per CO2 doubling.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.533
And you get about 2 degrees
Kelvin for every CO2 doubling.

00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:24.800
I want to do this
one other way.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.300
I know I'm beating this to
death, but you remember this

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:33.900
plot, from the Pleistocene, the
advance and retreat of the

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.667
glaciers over the last
400,000 years.

00:19:37.667 --> 00:19:39.800
Well, here we have a temperature
signature on the

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.567
bottom and a CO2 signature
on the top.

00:19:44.567 --> 00:19:48.100
We can convert the
CO2 signature

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:51.367
to a radiative forcing.

00:19:51.367 --> 00:19:52.867
And here's how that
argument goes.

00:19:52.867 --> 00:19:57.933
So that's a warming of about 5
degrees between glacial and

00:19:57.933 --> 00:20:00.933
interglacial times.

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:05.067
We estimate a change in the
longwave forcing of about 7

00:20:05.067 --> 00:20:07.433
watts per square meter.

00:20:07.433 --> 00:20:14.833
Divide one by the other, I get
about 0.7 degrees Kelvin per

00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:16.467
watt per square meter.

00:20:16.467 --> 00:20:18.967
Now that's slightly larger than
the one we had on the

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:21.967
last slide from the
last 100 years.

00:20:21.967 --> 00:20:26.900
And most people believe that
that number is larger than the

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:33.733
what did we have for that 0.5,
0.7, because you get these

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:38.133
extra long-term feedbacks
coming in.

00:20:38.133 --> 00:20:41.133
So there's still a lot of
argument in the literature

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:41.733
about that.

00:20:41.733 --> 00:20:44.800
But the general interpretation
is that when you go to this

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.467
longer time scale of a couple
hundred thousand years, you

00:20:48.467 --> 00:20:51.633
get some longer--some other
positive feedbacks that make

00:20:51.633 --> 00:20:54.467
the climate even more sensitive

00:20:54.467 --> 00:20:57.767
to radiative forcing.

00:20:57.767 --> 00:20:59.000
Any questions on that?

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:09.067
Yeah, so I'll just wrap that up
by saying, as expected, our

00:21:09.067 --> 00:21:12.567
climate is about 3 times more
sensitive to radiative forcing

00:21:12.567 --> 00:21:17.200
than Black Body would suggest,
due to positive feedbacks like

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:19.867
water vapor feedback and
snow/albedo feedback.

00:21:19.867 --> 00:21:22.500
And when you go to longer time
scales, it becomes even

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:25.933
slightly more sensitive due to,

00:21:25.933 --> 00:21:28.533
possibly, some other feedbacks.

00:21:28.533 --> 00:21:29.400
Yes?

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.133
STUDENT: Was the 5K increase
from like the lowest

00:21:30.133 --> 00:21:31.367
temperature to the highest
temperature on that graph?

00:21:37.433 --> 00:21:39.367
PROFESSOR: On the glacial one?

00:21:39.367 --> 00:21:39.967
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:21:39.967 --> 00:21:42.367
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I tried to
well, I didn't go to

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:45.467
the very max and the very min,
but I tried to take an average

00:21:45.467 --> 00:21:48.133
of the minimum and kind
of a general value

00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:49.133
for the higher ones.

00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:50.933
I didn't push it to the limit.

00:21:50.933 --> 00:21:52.233
You can't read that
scale there.

00:21:52.233 --> 00:21:55.200
But that would be slightly
larger than 5 degrees if you

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.567
went from minimum to maximum.

00:21:57.567 --> 00:22:00.500
So I've reduced it
a little bit.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.133
I didn't want to let
the noise, you

00:22:02.133 --> 00:22:04.400
know, drive my answer.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:08.000
I wanted to use average
values.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.833
Yeah, okay.

00:22:08.833 --> 00:22:11.000
So that's the summary.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.500
So this is everything then.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.100
We did all of these subjects.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:18.667
And today we just finished
up the concept of climate

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:20.400
sensitivity.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.767
Are there any general questions

00:22:21.767 --> 00:22:23.067
about global warming?

00:22:28.567 --> 00:22:31.533
Okay, if not, we'll
leave it there.

00:22:31.533 --> 00:22:35.567
And I want to do one
other thing today.

00:22:35.567 --> 00:22:37.433
I think we can get it in.

00:22:51.333 --> 00:22:55.867
Yeah, because population is a
driver in global warming, I

00:22:55.867 --> 00:22:59.700
wanted to just to spend the rest
of the period I'm not an

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:04.367
expert in demography or
population studies.

00:23:04.367 --> 00:23:07.267
But there's a few things that
are quite obvious, that even I

00:23:07.267 --> 00:23:07.767
can understand.

00:23:07.767 --> 00:23:09.667
And I wanted to lay
those out for you.

00:23:12.267 --> 00:23:14.400
Because it's intimately
connected with all these

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.133
environmental issues, including
the air pollution

00:23:17.133 --> 00:23:21.367
which we'll be studying next
time and on Friday.

00:23:21.367 --> 00:23:24.833
So these are the terms you're
going to have to know.

00:23:24.833 --> 00:23:29.100
The fertility rate is the number
of children that a

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.067
woman would bear in
her lifetime.

00:23:32.067 --> 00:23:35.200
The growth rate of a population
would be the rate

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:41.800
of change of the population as
a fraction of the existing

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:42.467
population.

00:23:42.467 --> 00:23:45.500
In other words, a
relative rate.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:49.633
Not a number of people per year,
but like a percent per

00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:51.967
year, or something like that.

00:23:51.967 --> 00:23:55.100
We'll talk about the special
case of exponential growth,

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.167
where the population would
follow a pure exponential

00:23:58.167 --> 00:24:02.667
curving rising curve.

00:24:02.667 --> 00:24:05.800
I'll talk about population
density, urbanization, the

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.600
so-called demographic
transition, and

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.800
the population pyramid.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.767
So in the next few minutes, I'll
introduce each of these

00:24:11.767 --> 00:24:14.267
terms.

00:24:14.267 --> 00:24:18.567
Population versus time, going
back 50,000 years, human

00:24:18.567 --> 00:24:24.267
population rose very slowly
over most of the period of

00:24:24.267 --> 00:24:31.067
time when humans were evolving,
because, well, life

00:24:31.067 --> 00:24:33.700
is difficult.

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.367
The death rate was high due to
disease, due to accidents, due

00:24:38.367 --> 00:24:40.033
to all kinds of things.

00:24:40.033 --> 00:24:43.433
And it isn't really until you
got in the very recent period

00:24:43.433 --> 00:24:46.833
of time where you began to get
this rapid, very rapid,

00:24:46.833 --> 00:24:48.833
increase in human population.

00:24:48.833 --> 00:24:55.033
Probably the biggest change in
the rate of growth had to do

00:24:55.033 --> 00:25:01.567
with the changes in medicine, I
would say the germ theory of

00:25:01.567 --> 00:25:05.567
disease and inoculations.

00:25:05.567 --> 00:25:07.200
Both of which are
rather recent.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.633
We're talking about the 19th,
in some cases the early part

00:25:10.633 --> 00:25:12.067
of the 20th century.

00:25:12.067 --> 00:25:19.000
1920, 1930, 1940 when mass
inoculations began to be used.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.500
Anyway it's a very curious
curve, so slow and so flat for

00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:29.033
so long, and then rising so
rapidly now just in the last

00:25:29.033 --> 00:25:32.400
100 years or so.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.467
That is partly controlled
by the fertility rate.

00:25:36.467 --> 00:25:42.000
And here's a diagram from
Wiki about that.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.933
What you have for each country
and this is by country is a

00:25:45.933 --> 00:25:49.867
fertility rate from
0--or from 1 to 7.

00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:52.333
So the United States
would have a value

00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:54.533
somewhere around 2.

00:25:54.533 --> 00:26:01.000
Remember this is the number of
births per woman in her life.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.067
And a lot of other countries
have that medium gray color,

00:26:06.067 --> 00:26:09.333
which puts you around 2.

00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:13.633
The Soviet Union, especially
Ukraine, is even less than

00:26:13.633 --> 00:26:15.967
that, however.

00:26:15.967 --> 00:26:19.733
And most of Africa and the
Middle East are dramatically

00:26:19.733 --> 00:26:24.167
higher, generally in
the range 4, 5, 6.

00:26:24.167 --> 00:26:26.567
That doesn't necessarily mean
that their population is

00:26:26.567 --> 00:26:30.067
increasing rapidly, although
that's true also.

00:26:30.067 --> 00:26:33.467
But the fertility rate is one of
the components that goes in

00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:39.267
to determining the rate
of population growth.

00:26:39.267 --> 00:26:44.600
Everybody understand this
definition of fertility rate?

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.967
It's controlled by a number
of factors, but a

00:26:47.967 --> 00:26:51.100
lot of it is cultural.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:56.567
A lot of it has to do with
expectations, having children

00:26:56.567 --> 00:26:58.700
to take care of you in your
old age, to help with the

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:04.933
farm, or because you don't
have a way to control

00:27:04.933 --> 00:27:07.100
population.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.567
A number of--a wide variety
of things come into

00:27:08.567 --> 00:27:09.867
the fertility rate.

00:27:09.867 --> 00:27:14.400
The role of women in society
is a big one as well.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:19.533
Here's the fertility rate
plotted versus GDP, the Gross

00:27:19.533 --> 00:27:23.300
Domestic Product, that makes
it pretty clear there's a

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:27.133
relationship between how much
money people have, their

00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:29.967
standard of living, and
the fertility rate.

00:27:29.967 --> 00:27:32.367
USA is here.

00:27:32.367 --> 00:27:36.300
Generally, for the developed
world the fertility

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:40.300
rate is 2 or less.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.500
Whereas for the underdeveloped
world the fertility rate can

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.567
be very much higher.

00:27:45.567 --> 00:27:51.533
And this magic value here, of
2.3, is the replacement rate.

00:27:51.533 --> 00:27:55.233
You have to have a fertility
rate of about 2.3 in order to

00:27:55.233 --> 00:27:56.633
maintain a steady population.

00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:04.767
There are a few outliers that
have to do with the special

00:28:04.767 --> 00:28:08.133
cultural conditions of
those countries.

00:28:12.467 --> 00:28:16.067
Stop me if there are
questions on this.

00:28:16.067 --> 00:28:19.867
So let's look at the fertility
rate for the United States and

00:28:19.867 --> 00:28:23.700
Canada since 1940.

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.933
There was a big bulge in
fertility rate, reaching 3.7

00:28:27.933 --> 00:28:31.333
for the USA around 1955.

00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:34.067
And that is really what's
responsible for what's called

00:28:34.067 --> 00:28:36.467
the Baby Boom in the
United States.

00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:39.733
And I guess you are the children
of the Baby Boom

00:28:39.733 --> 00:28:43.967
generation or something
approximate to that.

00:28:43.967 --> 00:28:48.100
And then immediately after that
came a movement called

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.467
ZPG, Zero Population Growth.

00:28:52.467 --> 00:28:55.067
Maybe that movement caused this
drop, or maybe it was

00:28:55.067 --> 00:28:58.400
just changes in background
cultural or economic

00:28:58.400 --> 00:28:58.800
conditions.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.233
But there was a dramatic drop
in the fertility rate in the

00:29:02.233 --> 00:29:09.967
United States from 3.7
down to less than 2.

00:29:09.967 --> 00:29:12.867
And now it's come up a little
bit for the United States to

00:29:12.867 --> 00:29:16.567
just about the replacement
rate.

00:29:16.567 --> 00:29:18.200
Canada is roughly similar.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.767
The details may be a little
different, they haven't jumped

00:29:20.767 --> 00:29:21.433
up at the end.

00:29:21.433 --> 00:29:25.300
But they followed roughly
the same curve.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.533
Any questions on that?

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.800
So this is a wild
swing, right?

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:34.367
This is a huge variation in
just a few years in one

00:29:34.367 --> 00:29:37.467
particular country.

00:29:37.467 --> 00:29:41.433
Europe is famous for having
a low fertility rate.

00:29:41.433 --> 00:29:43.067
And here are some
of the numbers.

00:29:43.067 --> 00:29:44.767
Remember the replacement
rate is about 2.3.

00:29:48.133 --> 00:29:50.667
Italy has 1.3.

00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:54.300
And some of the Eastern European
countries are even

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.200
lower than that.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.200
France is higher.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.200
They've tried to keep their
population, their

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.400
fertility rate up.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.133
But they don't have it quite
at replacement levels.

00:30:05.133 --> 00:30:07.267
And Spain is down
at 1.3 as well.

00:30:07.267 --> 00:30:11.233
So Europe, as a whole, generally
has a very low

00:30:11.233 --> 00:30:13.400
fertility rate.

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:21.000
We saw that in the earlier map
as well, here, as opposed to

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.633
some other developing
parts of the world.

00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:29.300
And China has gone through
wild swings, as

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.267
has the United States.

00:30:31.267 --> 00:30:33.800
For somewhat different reasons,
perhaps, but the

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.567
curve is somewhat similar.

00:30:38.567 --> 00:30:41.967
It climbed even higher than the
United States, much higher

00:30:41.967 --> 00:30:44.500
in fact, up to 6.5.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.167
And that, I think, was part of
the cultural revolution where

00:30:49.167 --> 00:30:53.433
it was every woman's duty to
have as many children as she

00:30:53.433 --> 00:30:57.433
possibly could for the strength
of the state.

00:30:57.433 --> 00:31:02.067
And then talk about a complete
turnabout they've now dropped

00:31:02.067 --> 00:31:03.900
down to less than 2.

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:07.600
And, of course, that is largely
due to China's one

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:12.467
child policy, kind of flipping
the political pressure on

00:31:12.467 --> 00:31:14.433
families and individuals.

00:31:14.433 --> 00:31:17.400
So wild swings in
fertility rate.

00:31:20.167 --> 00:31:22.700
Now we'll move to this
fractional growth rate then.

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:31.100
So, of course, this is now a
combination of birth rate and

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.633
mortality rate.

00:31:32.633 --> 00:31:34.033
How many children are
born every year?

00:31:34.033 --> 00:31:35.633
How many people die
every year?

00:31:35.633 --> 00:31:38.867
You have to know both of those
to then get the total

00:31:38.867 --> 00:31:42.433
fractional growth rate
of the population.

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:49.000
And there again, these colors
follow the same trend.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.300
As the Soviet Union has the
lowest growth rate, well 1--

00:31:54.300 --> 00:31:55.767
well below 0.

00:31:55.767 --> 00:31:57.533
They're losing population.

00:31:57.533 --> 00:32:03.567
And all the other countries are
gaining population, but at

00:32:03.567 --> 00:32:10.300
a rate ranging from 3% per year
to just a small fraction

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:14.033
of a percent per year.

00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:17.367
So that's the total fractional
growth rate.

00:32:17.367 --> 00:32:19.300
Here is the way you would
compute that.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.133
Here are some numbers.

00:32:20.133 --> 00:32:26.000
For example, China population
in 2010 and 1990.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.733
Well that's a 20 year span, so
you can get an approximation

00:32:29.733 --> 00:32:34.700
by just taking the percent
change over that period of

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:38.033
time and dividing that by
the number of years.

00:32:38.033 --> 00:32:41.633
So divide that by 20 and you
get a value that's just

00:32:41.633 --> 00:32:45.000
slightly less than
1% per year.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.200
And that would be that percent,
or that fractional

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.700
growth rate for population
in China.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.167
That's how you do
the calculation.

00:32:53.167 --> 00:32:57.633
In some cases taking a 20 year
estimate might be blurring

00:32:57.633 --> 00:32:59.200
some details.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:02.367
If the growth has been changing
rapidly over time,

00:33:02.367 --> 00:33:06.233
what you would be getting here
is some kind of average over a

00:33:06.233 --> 00:33:09.233
fluctuating quantity.

00:33:09.233 --> 00:33:12.433
But nevertheless, you see how
easy it is to do that

00:33:12.433 --> 00:33:17.133
calculation, if you don't mind
losing some of the details,

00:33:17.133 --> 00:33:18.933
some of the rapid
changes in time.

00:33:23.567 --> 00:33:30.033
So globally then, this is what
the fractional growth rate has

00:33:30.033 --> 00:33:33.433
been doing and is
projected to do.

00:33:33.433 --> 00:33:35.233
But these projections
are quite uncertain.

00:33:35.233 --> 00:33:37.933
I wouldn't pay too much
attention to the blue curve.

00:33:40.567 --> 00:33:44.067
Globally we've had, over the
last couple of decades, we've

00:33:44.067 --> 00:33:46.533
had growth rates--

00:33:46.533 --> 00:33:49.200
this is not fertility rate,
this is growth rate--

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:56.133
of about 2% per year, which is
quite a large growth rate.

00:33:56.133 --> 00:33:57.400
It has been decreasing.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:02.067
At the present time, it's
more like 1% per year.

00:34:02.067 --> 00:34:06.300
But that's still quite
a large growth rate.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.167
And then it's predicted
that will continue to

00:34:08.167 --> 00:34:10.267
drop as we go forward.

00:34:10.267 --> 00:34:14.667
But that will depend a lot upon
the future economy, the

00:34:14.667 --> 00:34:18.967
future cultural development of
the countries that have the

00:34:18.967 --> 00:34:20.233
highest populations.

00:34:23.733 --> 00:34:27.433
Now this concept of exponential
growth, you've

00:34:27.433 --> 00:34:30.867
probably heard it.

00:34:30.867 --> 00:34:34.267
If the fractional growth rate is
constant, that is, if this

00:34:34.267 --> 00:34:39.433
quantity were constant in time,
over some period of

00:34:39.433 --> 00:34:46.067
time, then the population
will grow exponentially.

00:34:46.067 --> 00:34:48.033
Now what does that mean, to
say the population grows

00:34:48.033 --> 00:34:48.800
exponentially?

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:53.300
The exponential function defines
a system whose annual

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:59.400
increase is proportional to
the population itself.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.833
In other words, its rate of
increase is proportional to

00:35:03.833 --> 00:35:06.400
the population that it has.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.933
That is what is meant by an
exponential increase.

00:35:09.933 --> 00:35:12.467
Sometimes that word
is misused.

00:35:12.467 --> 00:35:14.567
Sometimes in the popular
literature someone will be

00:35:14.567 --> 00:35:20.033
saying, well, you know I'm rich,
my bank account amount

00:35:20.033 --> 00:35:21.433
is growing exponentially.

00:35:21.433 --> 00:35:25.167
And by that he might
just mean rapidly.

00:35:25.167 --> 00:35:27.200
But that's not what exponential
really means.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.300
Exponential means it's growing
at a rate proportional to how

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:32.900
much you have.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:37.633
Now, if you're getting a fixed
interest rate in your account,

00:35:37.633 --> 00:35:40.633
then it would be exponential.

00:35:40.633 --> 00:35:43.367
It'll grow at a rate that will
increase as you get more and

00:35:43.367 --> 00:35:44.600
more money in the bank.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.533
So that might be an accurate
representation.

00:35:46.533 --> 00:35:52.000
Remember, exponential doesn't
refer to some rate of

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.967
increase, it relates to the
relationship between the rate

00:35:55.967 --> 00:35:59.267
of increase and the amount of
the standing population that

00:35:59.267 --> 00:36:02.233
you have at any particular
moment.

00:36:02.233 --> 00:36:05.433
So in other words, births
minus deaths, really,

00:36:05.433 --> 00:36:07.733
proportional to population.

00:36:07.733 --> 00:36:09.500
So we write it this way.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.033
Population, as a function
of time, is given by the

00:36:12.033 --> 00:36:19.133
population at some reference
time, call it 0, and then P to

00:36:19.133 --> 00:36:25.100
the plus alpha t, where alpha
is the growth rate and t is

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.233
the time that's elapsed
since your

00:36:28.233 --> 00:36:31.867
reference time has occurred.

00:36:31.867 --> 00:36:37.433
So if the growth rate, for
example, is 1% per year--

00:36:37.433 --> 00:36:41.500
and that was a number
that we have about

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:45.867
now for planet earth--

00:36:45.867 --> 00:36:48.333
and if that were to
remain constant.

00:36:48.333 --> 00:36:52.967
in other words, if this curve
was level at 1% per year, then

00:36:52.967 --> 00:36:56.433
here's how you could
do the calculation.

00:36:56.433 --> 00:37:03.933
After 100 years, putting in 100
years into there and 0.01

00:37:03.933 --> 00:37:09.667
year to the minus 1 in for
alpha, the units will cancel.

00:37:09.667 --> 00:37:16.467
And in this case, the product is
equal to 1, in this special

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:17.633
simple example.

00:37:17.633 --> 00:37:21.833
So it's going to be exp to the
1, which has a value-- you can

00:37:21.833 --> 00:37:23.233
check it on your calculator--

00:37:23.233 --> 00:37:25.100
of 2.7.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:30.900
So a growth rate of 0.01 over
100 years would give a growth

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.533
rate factor of 2.7.

00:37:32.533 --> 00:37:35.633
So however many people you had
at the beginning of the 100

00:37:35.633 --> 00:37:40.167
year period, put that there,
multiply it times 2.7, and

00:37:40.167 --> 00:37:40.700
you'll get--

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:43.767
it's roughly a tripling, roughly
a tripling of the

00:37:43.767 --> 00:37:48.767
population over 100 years if you
have a growth rate of 1%

00:37:48.767 --> 00:37:50.767
percent per year.

00:37:50.767 --> 00:37:54.933
Remember it's compound interest.
The rate increases

00:37:54.933 --> 00:37:56.267
as the population increases.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.300
Questions on that?

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.067
Now this is a bit of a fiction,
because, as you've

00:38:04.067 --> 00:38:07.700
just seen, population
growth rates change

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.400
quite a bit over time.

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:16.467
And so, while you can do rough
calculations with this, a real

00:38:16.467 --> 00:38:19.600
population demographer would
probably never use this.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.433
He would go step by step and
calculate it assuming a

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:26.700
variable growth rate rather than
assuming a constant one.

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.400
So here are the current
UN population

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.167
projections for our planet.

00:38:37.167 --> 00:38:40.733
Data up to this point, and then
uncertain projections,

00:38:40.733 --> 00:38:43.200
depending on what you think
the growth rate will

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.767
be around the world.

00:38:47.667 --> 00:38:52.333
So we crossed 6 billion back
in 2000, roughly 2000.

00:38:52.333 --> 00:38:56.433
We crossed 7 billion just,
what was that, 3

00:38:56.433 --> 00:39:00.767
weeks ago, I think.

00:39:00.767 --> 00:39:05.233
And in the future, well
the projections vary

00:39:05.233 --> 00:39:06.867
all over the place.

00:39:06.867 --> 00:39:12.133
But by, let's say, 2080, this
looks like 2080, some

00:39:12.133 --> 00:39:15.667
calculations would have
us at 12 billion.

00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:17.467
Some would have us at 9.

00:39:17.467 --> 00:39:20.467
And some would have us
declining, population already

00:39:20.467 --> 00:39:24.867
getting back towards
6 billion.

00:39:24.867 --> 00:39:27.167
So great uncertainties
in this.

00:39:27.167 --> 00:39:33.300
But still great potential for
environmental difficulties, if

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.700
either of those curves
are realized.

00:39:41.867 --> 00:39:45.133
Another issue that comes up
is population density.

00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:50.367
How many people per square
kilometer do you have?

00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:53.967
And this is a map of
population density.

00:39:53.967 --> 00:39:56.900
Units are people per
square kilometer.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.833
And there are some countries--

00:39:58.833 --> 00:40:02.367
and this is by country so this
can be quite misleading,

00:40:02.367 --> 00:40:07.167
because for a given country they
put a uniform color over

00:40:07.167 --> 00:40:08.967
the whole country.

00:40:08.967 --> 00:40:13.733
So it's the total population
divided by the total area of

00:40:13.733 --> 00:40:17.433
the country, then painted
as a uniform color

00:40:17.433 --> 00:40:18.267
over the whole country.

00:40:18.267 --> 00:40:19.433
That's quite unrealistic.

00:40:19.433 --> 00:40:22.467
But it will give us a place
to start to talk

00:40:22.467 --> 00:40:24.100
about population density.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.900
India, as a country, has a
population exceeding 1,000

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:32.667
people per square kilometer,
which is enormous.

00:40:32.667 --> 00:40:35.300
Whereas something like Australia
is in the lightest

00:40:35.300 --> 00:40:39.033
shade that they have,
less than 10

00:40:39.033 --> 00:40:41.700
people per square kilometer.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.100
Wide variation in
that quantity.

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:49.867
But again, this is quite
misleading because it's done

00:40:49.867 --> 00:40:51.933
by country.

00:40:51.933 --> 00:40:55.867
United States, this is
per square mile.

00:40:55.867 --> 00:40:59.167
Remember, the United States
unfortunately is still on an

00:40:59.167 --> 00:41:00.833
old English system of measure.

00:41:00.833 --> 00:41:06.233
So very often you'll find
population per square mile

00:41:06.233 --> 00:41:07.600
instead of per square
kilometer.

00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:12.100
You can do the conversion easily
to go back and forth.

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:15.267
But once again, doing it by
state is misleading, because

00:41:15.267 --> 00:41:17.333
there are parts of California
that are

00:41:17.333 --> 00:41:18.767
nearly empty of people.

00:41:18.767 --> 00:41:21.367
And there are very densely
populated areas of

00:41:21.367 --> 00:41:23.533
California and so on.

00:41:23.533 --> 00:41:26.667
But even averaging over states,
you'll find a big

00:41:26.667 --> 00:41:31.100
difference between Montana, for
example, and New Jersey

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.600
and Rhode Island.

00:41:35.633 --> 00:41:38.633
Now, if you want to read
about the role

00:41:38.633 --> 00:41:41.500
of population density--

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:45.733
not all demographers would put a
great emphasis on population

00:41:45.733 --> 00:41:49.833
density, but Jared Diamond,
in this book, Collapse--

00:41:49.833 --> 00:41:51.233
how many have read that book?

00:41:51.233 --> 00:41:54.667
I thought a few of you would
have. He, in places in that

00:41:54.667 --> 00:41:57.867
book, makes a pretty strong
case for the importance of

00:41:57.867 --> 00:41:59.333
population density.

00:41:59.333 --> 00:42:02.767
He really thinks it matters that
populations have enough

00:42:02.767 --> 00:42:04.767
space to live.

00:42:04.767 --> 00:42:06.167
And I partly agree with that.

00:42:06.167 --> 00:42:08.967
But he maybe takes it--

00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:12.667
some examples he gives wouldn't
carry over to other

00:42:12.667 --> 00:42:15.367
civilizations that he didn't
talk about in his book.

00:42:15.367 --> 00:42:17.700
But anyway, he makes a strong
case for the importance of

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.900
population density.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:20.267
And I party believe that too.

00:42:20.267 --> 00:42:23.067
So I encourage you to take a
look at that book if you get a

00:42:23.067 --> 00:42:27.067
chance, because it makes the
case very nicely for the

00:42:27.067 --> 00:42:28.600
importance of population
density.

00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:34.967
When you think about what the
limiting resources are for

00:42:34.967 --> 00:42:41.300
living on our planet, water,
food, energy, living space,

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:44.600
even these other ones, like
water and food and energy, to

00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:50.667
some extent they all depend on
having enough area as well.

00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:56.100
For example, energy from
hydroelectric requires a large

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.767
catchment area of rain in order
to get hydroelectric.

00:43:00.767 --> 00:43:04.967
Farmland, obviously food from
farms requires lots of area.

00:43:04.967 --> 00:43:08.733
So just scanning this list and
realizing that many of those

00:43:08.733 --> 00:43:16.333
have a relationship to
population density would, I

00:43:16.333 --> 00:43:22.500
think, partly confirm Jared
Diamond's idea that living

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.200
space is an important part of
the success of a culture.

00:43:29.567 --> 00:43:34.033
Okay, now to correct the
misimpression from those

00:43:34.033 --> 00:43:37.767
earlier country-based and

00:43:37.767 --> 00:43:40.333
state-based population
densities.

00:43:40.333 --> 00:43:44.133
People don't live uniformly
distributed over a

00:43:44.133 --> 00:43:46.333
country or a state.

00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:50.900
In fact, a higher and higher
fraction of populations are

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:52.267
moving to cities.

00:43:52.267 --> 00:43:54.900
They're abandoning the land
and moving to cities.

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:59.833
So this is a plot, on the x-axis
1950 into the future,

00:43:59.833 --> 00:44:04.667
2050, the percent of the
population that's living in

00:44:04.667 --> 00:44:07.033
urban versus rural areas.

00:44:07.033 --> 00:44:12.300
Back in the 1950's, 70%
was rural, 30% urban.

00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.867
And we've crossed that boundary,
we've crossed that

00:44:15.867 --> 00:44:17.233
crossover point.

00:44:17.233 --> 00:44:19.900
And in the future, we'll have
more people living clustered

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.467
together in cities.

00:44:21.467 --> 00:44:23.433
That doesn't mean they don't
need the land around the

00:44:23.433 --> 00:44:26.433
cities to grow the food and
provide the energy and so on.

00:44:26.433 --> 00:44:30.267
But at least their living
density is much larger than

00:44:30.267 --> 00:44:34.200
those country-averaged or those
state-averaged values

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.067
that I gave you.

00:44:36.067 --> 00:44:39.467
And these are some of the
growing megacities, where now

00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:44.133
more than half the people in
the world are concentrated

00:44:44.133 --> 00:44:45.733
into these large cities.

00:44:45.733 --> 00:44:46.133
Yes?

00:44:46.133 --> 00:44:47.400
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:55.367 --> 00:44:56.833
PROFESSOR: I don't know.

00:44:56.833 --> 00:44:59.600
When you do calculations--

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.767
I saw an article recently about
how much energy people

00:45:03.767 --> 00:45:07.667
used that live in New York city
versus the rest of New

00:45:07.667 --> 00:45:09.500
York state.

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.467
And the people who live in New
York city use less energy per

00:45:12.467 --> 00:45:16.533
capita then the people that
live in upstate New York.

00:45:16.533 --> 00:45:19.233
Probably because of the dense
way that they live and the way

00:45:19.233 --> 00:45:23.100
that transportation is so much
easier when you live close.

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.633
So I think it could be argued
that this might be a more

00:45:25.633 --> 00:45:27.367
efficient way to live.

00:45:27.367 --> 00:45:28.700
But that's only one measure.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:32.767
And I haven't studied the issue
in it's full breadth.

00:45:32.767 --> 00:45:34.167
So that would be worth
looking into.

00:45:34.167 --> 00:45:37.033
To see whether this might
actually be an advantage for

00:45:37.033 --> 00:45:44.133
the environment, to have people
clustered in cities.

00:45:44.133 --> 00:45:46.367
Other comments on that?

00:45:46.367 --> 00:45:47.400
We need to wrap up.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.633
I do need to give you this.

00:45:48.633 --> 00:45:51.000
So there's something called the
demographic transition.

00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.300
And it goes basically from a
third world country converting

00:45:57.300 --> 00:45:58.833
to a first world country.

00:45:58.833 --> 00:46:01.433
What happens to its
population?

00:46:01.433 --> 00:46:04.933
In the beginning, you've got a
high birth rate, a high death

00:46:04.933 --> 00:46:06.600
rate, and a small population.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:14.633
Standard of living begins to
increase, health is improved.

00:46:14.633 --> 00:46:18.533
The first thing that happens
is the death rate drops.

00:46:18.533 --> 00:46:21.000
The birth rate stays high.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.767
Because the death rate has
dropped and the birth rate

00:46:22.767 --> 00:46:26.400
stays high, population
begins to increase.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.467
Then, at some point culturally,
the birth rate

00:46:29.467 --> 00:46:31.233
drops as well.

00:46:31.233 --> 00:46:34.033
You end up with a lower birth
rate and a lower death rate

00:46:34.033 --> 00:46:35.900
and a larger total population.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:38.700
We've seen this happen in
country after country.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.367
And if you look at that map
of the world, clearly some

00:46:41.367 --> 00:46:44.567
countries in the west,
like the US and

00:46:44.567 --> 00:46:46.367
Europe are in this state.

00:46:46.367 --> 00:46:47.967
And a lot of the third
world countries are

00:46:47.967 --> 00:46:48.967
still in this state.

00:46:48.967 --> 00:46:52.000
And a few are in the middle,
doing the demographic

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.567
transition.

00:46:53.567 --> 00:46:57.467
So this is an important concept
of how you go from one

00:46:57.467 --> 00:47:01.467
type of population situation
to the other.

00:47:01.467 --> 00:47:02.667
And the other one I want
to leave you with--

00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:04.467
I'm out of time-- but you
have to know about

00:47:04.467 --> 00:47:05.767
the population pyramid.

00:47:05.767 --> 00:47:12.067
So a country that has a stable
population, here's a plot of

00:47:12.067 --> 00:47:14.200
how many people you have,
male and female, in

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.367
different age groups.

00:47:17.367 --> 00:47:20.133
A country that has a stable
population usually has a

00:47:20.133 --> 00:47:22.700
population pyramid like this.

00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.400
A country that has a rapidly
growing population has a

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.600
pyramid like this, a lot
of young people.

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.867
And as they get older, of
course, the overall population

00:47:31.867 --> 00:47:34.133
will increase very rapidly.

00:47:34.133 --> 00:47:36.167
Well, you can see this
immediately, because if you

00:47:36.167 --> 00:47:40.700
drive into a small town in the
Middle East or in Africa, the

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.800
number of children that come
running out of the house to

00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.300
see who's visiting their village
tells you you've got a

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.167
population curve like that.

00:47:50.167 --> 00:47:52.600
And that will do it.
825
00:47:52,600 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
Okay, we're finished.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.470
Prof: All right.
 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.207
Now last time we were giving
examples of what might happen if

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:11.551
one takes seriously that
extraordinary eleventh footnote

00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:15.499
in Wimsatt's "The
Intentional Fallacy"

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:20.237
in which he says that the
history of words after a

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:24.343
poem was composed may well be
relevant to the overall

00:00:24.343 --> 00:00:29.397
structure of the poem and should
not be avoided owing simply to a

00:00:29.397 --> 00:00:32.240
scruple about intention.
 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.369
Essentially,
that's what Wimsatt says in the

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.170
footnote.
 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.860
So I went back to the great
creator raising his plastic arm

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.939
and suggested that,
well, maybe after all there

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:46.174
might be some good way of
complicating the meaning of

00:00:46.174 --> 00:00:48.850
Akenside by suggesting that the
modern,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.249
anachronistic meaning of
"plastic"

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.760
would be relevant to the sense
of the poem.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.520
This by the way--just because
one can make this claim and,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.048
I think, make it stick in
certain cases,

00:01:00.048 --> 00:01:03.207
doesn't mean that the
proposition is any less

00:01:03.207 --> 00:01:04.140
outrageous.
 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.159
Just imagine
&gt;

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.969
a philologist being
confronted with the idea that

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.849
the meaning of words at a
certain historical moment isn't

00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:18.007
the only thing that matters in
understanding the meaning of a

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:18.769
poem.
 

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:22.697
So I just wanted to give
another example a little closer

00:01:22.697 --> 00:01:26.555
to home in the poem of Yeats,
the 1935 poem "Lapis

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:27.769
Lazuli."
 

00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:29.659
I began talking about it last
time.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.512
It's a poem which begins,
"I have heard that

00:01:33.512 --> 00:01:37.845
hysterical women say / they are
sick of the palette and

00:01:37.845 --> 00:01:42.423
fiddle-bow,
/ of poets that are always

00:01:42.423 --> 00:01:44.069
gay..."
 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:47.248
The storm clouds of the
approaching war are beginning to

00:01:47.248 --> 00:01:47.769
gather.
 

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:52.757
A lot of people are saying,
"Enough of this kind of

00:01:52.757 --> 00:01:54.300
effete culture.
 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.930
We need to think about
important things,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.299
particularly about politics and
the social order"--

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.400
by the way, a very powerful
argument in 1935.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.300
In any case,
Yeats was on the other side of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.300
the controversy and insisted,
after all, that there is a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.436
continuing role for art,
as indeed, on the other hand,

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.199
there may well be even in such
times.

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.852
So he's sick of everybody
saying they don't want to talk

00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:22.864
about painting,
they don't want to talk about

00:02:22.864 --> 00:02:24.119
music,
and they don't want to talk

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:25.650
about poets who are "always
gay."

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.500
All right.
 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.840
So then the poem continues.
 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.006
It involves a stone,
a piece of lapis lazuli that

00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:38.958
has a kind of a flaw in it,
which is like a

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:42.764
"water-course,"
and where one can imagine a

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:46.500
pilgrim climbing toward
increased enlightenment.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.205
As the poem goes on,
Yeats talks about the way in

00:02:50.205 --> 00:02:53.729
which civilizations crumble--
that is to say,

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.860
all things fall apart,
but then it's possible to build

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.910
them back up.
 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:04.264
He says, "All things fall
and are built again / and those

00:03:04.264 --> 00:03:07.598
that build them again are
gay."

00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:10.938
Now, as I said last time,
needless to say,

00:03:10.938 --> 00:03:15.419
Yeats was not aware of the
anachronistic meaning that we

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:19.330
may be tempted to bring to bear
on the poem.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.050
Yeats is thinking of Nietzsche,
he's thinking of a word,

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.211
froehlich,
which probably is best

00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:29.060
translated "joyous,
energetically joyous."

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.084
He is just borrowing that word
from the translation of a book

00:03:35.084 --> 00:03:36.590
by Nietzsche.
 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.295
Well and good but,
if you were a queer theorist or

00:03:41.295 --> 00:03:45.810
if you were interested in making
not a weak,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.200
but a strong claim for the
importance of queerness in our

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.995
literary tradition,
you would be very tempted to

00:03:54.995 --> 00:03:58.793
say, this enriches the poem--
not just, in other words,

00:03:58.793 --> 00:04:02.718
that they are energetically
joyous as creators,

00:04:02.718 --> 00:04:05.687
but also that in our
contemporary sense of the word

00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:06.520
they're gay.
 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.030
Now this again,
as in the case of Akenside,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.949
may or may not raise the
hackles of the philologists,

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.014
but there's a certain sense in
which from a certain point of

00:04:17.014 --> 00:04:21.523
view,
it's difficult to deny that it

00:04:21.523 --> 00:04:26.300
doesn't lend a certain
coherence,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.105
an additionally complex
coherence, to the nature of the

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:31.730
poem.
 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.730
All right.
 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.269
Then we have Tony the Tow
Truck.

00:04:35.269 --> 00:04:38.012
You're probably beginning
to wish I would refer to it,

00:04:38.012 --> 00:04:38.829
so why don't I?
 

00:04:38.829 --> 00:04:40.803
In the second line of Tony
the Tow Truck,

00:04:40.803 --> 00:04:43.790
we learn that "I live
in a little yellow garage."

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.468
Now of course,
the denotation of the

00:04:46.468 --> 00:04:50.040
word "yellow,"
as Cleanth Brooks would say,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.240
is that the garage is painted a
certain color.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.541
The connotation,
which undoubtedly the author

00:04:57.541 --> 00:05:00.786
had no notion of,
wasn't thinking of--this is a

00:05:00.786 --> 00:05:04.146
book for toddlers--
the connotation is that somehow

00:05:04.146 --> 00:05:07.759
or another there's the
imputation of cowardice,

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:12.670
possibly also the derogatory
imputation of being Asian.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.870
Maybe Tony is Asian.
 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.110
Well--okay.
 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.214
This has nothing to do with the
text, we say,

00:05:18.214 --> 00:05:21.180
and yet at the same time
suppose it did.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.829
We could interrogate the author
psychoanalytically.

00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:27.319
We could say,
"Hey, wait a minute.

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.189
Okay.
 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.199
So you say it was painted
yellow.

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.899
Why don't you say it's painted
some other color?"

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:36.060
We could begin to put a certain
amount of pressure on the text

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.793
and possibly,
as I say, begin to do things

00:05:38.793 --> 00:05:42.259
with it which are kind of a
five-finger exercise--

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:44.759
we'll be doing a lot more of
that sort of thing--

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.259
but which might work.
 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:46.930
All right.
 

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:50.543
These are examples of the
extraordinary implications of

00:05:50.543 --> 00:05:54.572
Wimsatt's eleventh footnote,
and also, I think,

00:05:54.572 --> 00:05:59.240
perhaps in advance of today's
discussion,

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.661
clarify to some extent the
importance for critics of this

00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:07.180
kind of notion of unity.
 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.579
In some ways,
everything we have to say today

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.129
will concern the idea of unity.
 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.970
In other words,
a connotation is valuable and

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:22.380
ought to be invoked even if it's
philologically incorrect if it

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.959
contributes to the unity,
the complex building up of the

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.810
unity,
of the literary text.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.459
If, on the other hand,
it is what Gadamer would call a

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.863
"bad prejudice"--
that is to say,

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:39.675
some aspect of my subjectivity
that nothing could possibly be

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:43.360
done with in thinking about and
interpreting the text--

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.420
then you throw it out.
 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.413
So the criterion is:
is it relevant to the unified

00:06:49.413 --> 00:06:55.529
form that we as critics are
trying to realize in the text?

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:58.721
That criterion,
as I say--not just for the

00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:03.081
sorts of semi-facetious readings
we can do with Wimsatt's

00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:07.831
eleventh footnote but also for
readings that may at least have

00:07:07.831 --> 00:07:13.141
some marginal plausibility--
this sense of unity is what

00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:17.579
governs interpretive decisions
of this kind.

00:07:17.579 --> 00:07:18.829
All right.
 

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:21.495
Now a word or two about the
antecedents of the New

00:07:21.495 --> 00:07:26.718
Criticism: In the first place,
the thirties and forties in the

00:07:26.718 --> 00:07:33.136
academic world bear witness to
the rise of a canon of taste

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:39.110
largely introduced by the great
Modernist writers,

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.990
particularly by T.S.***Eliot.
 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.235
You may notice that Brooks,
for example,

00:07:43.235 --> 00:07:45.079
has a kind of Donne obsession.
 

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:49.084
He gets that from Eliot's essay
"The Metaphysical

00:07:49.084 --> 00:07:53.468
Poets," which is a review
essay of a volume of Donne's

00:07:53.468 --> 00:07:57.625
poems edited by somebody named
Grierson which made Donne

00:07:57.625 --> 00:08:00.531
overnight,
for a great many readers,

00:08:00.531 --> 00:08:03.319
the central poet in the English
tradition.

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:05.923
Brooks is still,
as I say, very much under the

00:08:05.923 --> 00:08:07.079
influence of this.
 

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:09.021
Well, Eliot,
in "The Metaphysical

00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:11.959
Poets," says some rather
interesting things that had

00:08:11.959 --> 00:08:14.689
far-reaching consequences for
the New Criticism.

00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:20.576
He says, "Poetry in our
own time--such is the complexity

00:08:20.576 --> 00:08:25.579
of the world we live in--must be
difficult."

00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:31.033
He says that poetry has to
reconcile all sorts of disparate

00:08:31.033 --> 00:08:35.640
experience--reading Spinoza,
the smell of cooking,

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.649
the sound of the typewriter.
 

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:43.907
All of this has to be yoked
together in the imagery of a

00:08:43.907 --> 00:08:47.201
good poem,
particularly of a metaphysical

00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:50.303
poem,
and this model of complexity is

00:08:50.303 --> 00:08:54.958
what matters both for modern
literature and for literary

00:08:54.958 --> 00:08:56.058
criticism.
 

00:08:56.058 --> 00:09:00.605
Now by the same token,
other Modernists like James

00:09:00.605 --> 00:09:05.988
Joyce are also contributing to
this idea of the independent

00:09:05.988 --> 00:09:08.678
unity of the work of art.
 

00:09:08.678 --> 00:09:12.677
In "Stephen Hero"
or "Portrait of the Artist

00:09:12.677 --> 00:09:16.469
as a Young Man," you
remember Stephen in his

00:09:16.469 --> 00:09:20.673
disquisition on form and Aquinas
and all the rest of it argues

00:09:20.673 --> 00:09:24.327
that the work of art is
something that is cut off from

00:09:24.327 --> 00:09:28.394
its creator because its creator
withdraws from it and simply

00:09:28.394 --> 00:09:32.470
pares his fingernails,
in the famous expression.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:34.320
It's very interesting.
 

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.259
You remember that in the
Wimsatt that you read last time,

00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:40.743
Wimsatt argues--I think
probably thinking about that

00:09:40.743 --> 00:09:43.546
passage in Joyce--
that the work of art is

00:09:43.546 --> 00:09:46.418
"cut off"
from its author at birth.

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:50.210
This is an umbilical cord he's
talking about.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.990
It has no more connection with
its author from birth on and

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.379
roams the world on its own.
 

00:09:57.379 --> 00:10:01.606
Ideas like this,
as I say, are taken from the

00:10:01.606 --> 00:10:07.659
aesthetic and practical thinking
about the nature of the work of

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:11.120
art that one finds in Modernism.
 

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.700
In the meantime,
let's consider the academic

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:14.298
setting.
 

00:10:14.298 --> 00:10:18.181
In the 1930s,
when Ransom in particular is

00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:21.590
writing his polemical
manifestos,

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.066
The New Criticism and
The World's Body,

00:10:25.066 --> 00:10:28.985
and attacking most of what's
going on as it's being done by

00:10:28.985 --> 00:10:32.394
his colleagues,
he has two things in particular

00:10:32.394 --> 00:10:35.823
in mind: in the first place,
old-fashioned philology,

00:10:35.823 --> 00:10:39.267
the kind of thinking about the
literary text that would insist

00:10:39.267 --> 00:10:42.089
that "plastic"
means what it means in the

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:45.750
eighteenth century--
and a lot of that was being

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:46.250
done.
 

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.534
This was the golden age of the
consolidation of the literary

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:51.480
profession.
 

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.678
Standard editions are being
created.

00:10:53.678 --> 00:10:57.389
The great learned journals are
in their early phase.

00:10:57.389 --> 00:11:01.760
Knowledge is actually still
being accumulated having to do

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.519
with the basic facts of the
literary tradition.

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:09.802
We didn't know a great deal
about certain authors until this

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:13.721
period of the flourishing of
philology in the very late

00:11:13.721 --> 00:11:17.931
nineteenth and early twentieth
century took hold and pretty

00:11:17.931 --> 00:11:22.067
much created for us the archive
that we now use today in a

00:11:22.067 --> 00:11:23.808
variety of ways.
 

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:27.738
So although the New Critics
were fed up with philological

00:11:27.738 --> 00:11:29.677
criticism,
I don't mean to be

00:11:29.677 --> 00:11:32.994
condescending toward it or to
suggest that it didn't play a

00:11:32.994 --> 00:11:36.710
crucially important role in the
evolution of literary studies.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.629
Now the other thing that was
going on,

00:11:38.629 --> 00:11:42.548
and here--I don't know,
depending on one's viewpoint,

00:11:42.548 --> 00:11:45.500
perhaps some measure of
condescension might be in order,

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.538
but these two were
spectacular figures--

00:11:47.538 --> 00:11:50.268
the other thing that was going
on was that there was a vogue

00:11:50.268 --> 00:11:52.211
for what might be called
"appreciative

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:53.090
teaching."
 

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.725
That is, the contemporary and
colleague of I.A. Richards at

00:11:57.725 --> 00:12:00.761
Cambridge was the famous
"Q,"

00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:06.573
Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch,
whose mesmerizing lectures had

00:12:06.573 --> 00:12:09.720
virtually no content at all.
 

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.703
They were simply evocations,
appreciative evocations,

00:12:13.703 --> 00:12:16.080
of great works of literature.
 

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.668
I have to say that at Yale,
exactly contemporary with

00:12:19.668 --> 00:12:22.500
"Q"
we had a similar figure,

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.451
the person after whom Phelps
Gate is named:

00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:30.417
the great William Lyon Phelps,
who would enter the classroom,

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:33.769
begin rapturously to quote
Tennyson,

00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:37.960
would clasp his hands and say
that it was really good stuff,

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:41.977
and the students were so
appreciative that they gave

00:12:41.977 --> 00:12:46.312
hundreds and thousands of
dollars to the university ever

00:12:46.312 --> 00:12:47.100
after.
 

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.340
In other words,
this was valuable

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.178
teaching, &gt;
 

00:12:51.178 --> 00:12:53.072
but again
&gt;

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.336
&gt;
 

00:12:54.336 --> 00:12:56.750
the New Critics were fed up
with it.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.879
This was the atmosphere they
found themselves in,

00:12:58.879 --> 00:13:02.691
and what they wanted--and this
anticipates the atmosphere that

00:13:02.691 --> 00:13:05.940
you'll see the Russian
formalists found themselves in

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.315
when we turn to them next week--
what they wanted was something

00:13:10.315 --> 00:13:14.140
like rigor or a scientific basis
or some sort of set of

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.399
principles that could actually
be invoked,

00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:21.155
so that the business of
criticism could become more

00:13:21.155 --> 00:13:24.736
careful and systematic,
less scattershot,

00:13:24.736 --> 00:13:27.129
less effusive and so on.
 

00:13:27.129 --> 00:13:31.678
So this is, in effect,
the backdrop in which in the

00:13:31.678 --> 00:13:35.739
American academy--
influenced, as we'll now see,

00:13:35.739 --> 00:13:39.058
by certain trends in the
British academy--

00:13:39.058 --> 00:13:42.789
arose in the thirties and in
the forties.

00:13:42.789 --> 00:13:45.129
All right.
 

00:13:45.129 --> 00:13:49.283
Now the first figure I want to
talk a little bit about,

00:13:49.283 --> 00:13:53.669
and the first figure whom you
read for today's assignment,

00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:55.440
is I.A. Richards.
 

00:13:55.440 --> 00:14:01.000
Richards, before he joined the
English department at Cambridge,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.181
was actually a psychologist,
trained as a Pavlovian

00:14:05.181 --> 00:14:08.652
psychologist,
so that when you read in his

00:14:08.652 --> 00:14:12.688
essay about "stimuli"
and "needs,"

00:14:12.688 --> 00:14:15.658
you see pretty much where you
stand.

00:14:15.658 --> 00:14:19.629
His sense of the way in which
the mind reacts to the world,

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:22.715
to its experience,
and the way in which it's an

00:14:22.715 --> 00:14:26.450
uncomplicated reaction,
a resisting reaction,

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:31.360
or an adjusting reaction,
all has very much to do with

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:33.210
Pavlovian principles.
 

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:38.677
These govern to some extent
Richards' understanding even of

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:44.331
his literary vocation during the
period when in 1924 he wrote

00:14:44.331 --> 00:14:48.480
Principles of Literary
Criticism.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.596
For Richards,
reading is all about

00:14:51.596 --> 00:14:56.842
experience--that is to say,
the way in which the mind is

00:14:56.842 --> 00:14:59.168
affected by what it reads.
 

00:14:59.168 --> 00:15:03.720
And so even though his subject
matter is literature,

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.830
he's nevertheless constantly
talking about human psychology--

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:10.750
that is to say,
what need is answered by

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:13.566
literature,
how the psyche responds to

00:15:13.566 --> 00:15:16.750
literature,
what's good and bad about

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.700
psychic responses,
and so on.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.721
This is the intellectual focus,
in other words,

00:15:23.721 --> 00:15:25.470
of Richards' work.
 

00:15:25.470 --> 00:15:29.681
Now another aspect of his
having been and continuing to be

00:15:29.681 --> 00:15:33.450
a scientist is that Richards
really did believe,

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:36.379
seriously believed,
in reference--

00:15:36.379 --> 00:15:39.601
that is to say,
in the way in which language

00:15:39.601 --> 00:15:42.149
really can hook on to the world.
 

00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:46.428
Verifiable and falsifiable
statement is for Richards the

00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:50.938
essence of scientific practice
and he cares very much about

00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:51.639
that.
 

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:54.065
He does not,
in other words,

00:15:54.065 --> 00:15:57.570
share with so many literary
critics--

00:15:57.570 --> 00:16:00.394
perhaps even with Brooks,
who follows him in making the

00:16:00.394 --> 00:16:02.960
fundamental distinction I'm
about to describe--

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:07.423
he does not share with the
majority of literary critics and

00:16:07.423 --> 00:16:10.580
artists a kind of distaste for
science.

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.160
This, by the way,
is also true of his student,

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.316
Empson, who was a math major
before he became an English

00:16:16.316 --> 00:16:16.889
major.
 

00:16:16.889 --> 00:16:21.770
Both of them take very
seriously the notion that there

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:27.205
can be a scientific basis for
what one does in English or in

00:16:27.205 --> 00:16:29.139
literary studies.
 

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:32.840
So another aspect of it for
Richards is--

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.308
because he takes science so
seriously--

00:16:35.308 --> 00:16:39.192
is that he actually reverses
the idea that we talked about

00:16:39.192 --> 00:16:41.942
last time in Sidney,
Kant, Coleridge,

00:16:41.942 --> 00:16:43.418
Wilde, and Wimsatt.
 

00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:47.830
He actually reverses the idea
that it's art that's autonomous.

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:52.090
If you look on page 766 in the
left-hand column,

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.750
you'll find him saying that
science is autonomous,

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:01.576
and what he means by that is
that scientific facts can be

00:17:01.576 --> 00:17:06.316
described in statements without
the need for any kind of

00:17:06.316 --> 00:17:11.314
psychological context or any
dependency on the varieties of

00:17:11.314 --> 00:17:12.778
human need.
 

00:17:12.778 --> 00:17:17.288
It is autonomous in the sense
that it is a pure,

00:17:17.288 --> 00:17:22.086
uncluttered and uninfluenced
declaration of fact or

00:17:22.086 --> 00:17:23.430
falsehood.
 

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.382
Then he says:
To declare Science autonomous

00:17:26.382 --> 00:17:30.202
is very different from
subordinating all our activities

00:17:30.202 --> 00:17:30.838
to it.
 

00:17:30.838 --> 00:17:35.578
[Here's where poetry comes in.]
It is merely to assert that so

00:17:35.578 --> 00:17:40.007
far as any body of references is
undistorted it belongs to

00:17:40.007 --> 00:17:40.940
Science.
 

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.076
It is not in the least to
assert that no references may be

00:17:45.076 --> 00:17:48.269
distorted if advantage can
thereby gained.

00:17:48.269 --> 00:17:51.751
And just as there are
innumerable human activities

00:17:51.751 --> 00:17:55.092
which require undistorted
references [scientific

00:17:55.092 --> 00:17:58.288
activities]
if they are to be satisfied,

00:17:58.288 --> 00:18:02.497
so there are innumerable other
human activities not less

00:18:02.497 --> 00:18:07.009
important which equally require
distorted references or,

00:18:07.009 --> 00:18:09.618
more plainly, fictions.
 

00:18:09.618 --> 00:18:13.872
Here you see Richards' basic
distinction between what he

00:18:13.872 --> 00:18:16.733
calls "scientific
statement"

00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:20.367
and what he calls "emotive
statement,"

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:25.240
the distinction between that
which is truly referential--

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:31.180
that which is incontrovertibly
verifiable or falsifiable on the

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:35.115
one hand,
and that which is emotive on

00:18:35.115 --> 00:18:36.210
the other.
 

00:18:36.210 --> 00:18:39.175
Later on Richards changes his
vocabulary, and he no longer

00:18:39.175 --> 00:18:41.568
talks about scientific and
emotive language.

00:18:41.568 --> 00:18:44.202
Even more dangerously,
from the standpoint of anybody

00:18:44.202 --> 00:18:46.328
who likes poetry,
&gt;

00:18:46.328 --> 00:18:49.053
he talks instead of
"statement,"

00:18:49.053 --> 00:18:50.315
meaning science,
and

00:18:50.315 --> 00:18:53.568
"pseudo-statement,"
meaning poetry.

00:18:53.568 --> 00:18:56.364
You are really out on a
limb if you're going to defend

00:18:56.364 --> 00:18:58.278
poetry--
as Richards kept doing--as

00:18:58.278 --> 00:19:00.616
"pseudo-statement,"
but of course

00:19:00.616 --> 00:19:03.847
"pseudo-statement"
is just another expression for

00:19:03.847 --> 00:19:06.298
what he calls here
"fiction."

00:19:06.298 --> 00:19:11.650
Once we sort of settle into
this vocabulary,

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.894
and once we get used to this
clearly unquestioningly

00:19:14.894 --> 00:19:18.448
scientific perspective,
why on earth do we need

00:19:18.448 --> 00:19:21.420
pseudo-statement or fiction at
all?

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.710
We know very well,
by the way, that there are

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.624
scientists who simply cannot
stand to read poetry because

00:19:26.624 --> 00:19:27.769
it's false, right?
 

00:19:27.769 --> 00:19:32.911
Just as Richards says,
there's always something kind

00:19:32.911 --> 00:19:37.750
of archaic or atavistic about
poetic thinking.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.275
It's not just that it's not
trying to tell the truth,

00:19:41.275 --> 00:19:44.732
as Sidney said--"nothing
lieth because it never

00:19:44.732 --> 00:19:46.088
affirmeth."
 

00:19:46.088 --> 00:19:50.268
It is in fact,
Richards goes so far as to say,

00:19:50.268 --> 00:19:53.240
following Plato,
lying.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:59.564
Poetry is constantly getting
itself in trouble in all sorts

00:19:59.564 --> 00:20:03.490
of ways--on page 768,
for example.

00:20:16.778 --> 00:20:20.666
He says, sort of toward the top
of the right-hand column,

00:20:20.666 --> 00:20:23.337
page 768:
It is evident that the bulk of

00:20:23.337 --> 00:20:26.769
poetry consists of statements
which only the very foolish

00:20:26.769 --> 00:20:29.160
would think of attempting to
verify.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.798
They are not the kinds of
things which can be verified.

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:37.328
In other words,
they're a pack of lies.

00:20:37.328 --> 00:20:40.940
It usually follows from this
that somebody like this points

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:44.673
out that whereas we all know
that a democratic society is the

00:20:44.673 --> 00:20:48.102
best society to live in,
poetry prefers feudal society:

00:20:48.102 --> 00:20:49.400
it makes better poetry.
 

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:55.298
Whereas we all know that the
universe is of a certain kind--

00:20:55.298 --> 00:20:57.970
we can't even call it
Copernican anymore--

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:02.269
poetry has this odd preference
for Ptolemaic astronomy.

00:21:02.269 --> 00:21:05.132
In other words,
everything about poetry is

00:21:05.132 --> 00:21:05.970
atavistic.
 

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.818
It's a throwback to some
earlier way of thinking.

00:21:08.818 --> 00:21:13.186
There is some kind of latent
primitivism in poetic thinking,

00:21:13.186 --> 00:21:17.108
and Richards seems cheerfully
to embrace this idea.

00:21:17.108 --> 00:21:19.203
That's what he means by
"fiction"

00:21:19.203 --> 00:21:20.900
or
"pseudo-statement."

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.380
So why on earth do we want it?
 

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:27.411
We want it, according to
Richards, because it answers

00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:32.345
needs in our psychological
makeup that science can't

00:21:32.345 --> 00:21:33.410
answer.
 

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:38.920
In other words,
we are a chaos of desires.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.759
Some of them involve the desire
for truth--

00:21:43.759 --> 00:21:45.912
that is to say,
for what we can learn from

00:21:45.912 --> 00:21:48.200
science--
but a great many of our desires

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.960
have nothing to do with any
notion of truth but,

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:56.453
rather, are needs that require
fanciful or imaginative

00:21:56.453 --> 00:22:01.230
fulfillment,
fulfillment of other kinds.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:06.808
The reason this fulfillment is
important and can be valued is,

00:22:06.808 --> 00:22:10.170
according to Richards,
that these needs--

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:14.211
unless they are organized or
harmonized so that they work

00:22:14.211 --> 00:22:18.759
together in what he sometimes
calls a "synthesis"--

00:22:18.759 --> 00:22:21.920
can actually tear us apart.
 

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:26.878
Literature is what can
reconcile conflicting or

00:22:26.878 --> 00:22:30.800
opposing needs,
and Richards cares so much

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:34.230
about this basic idea that in
another text,

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:36.160
not in the text you've just
read, he says,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.750
shockingly, "Poetry is
capable of saving us."

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.950
In other words,
poetry is capable of doing now

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:44.868
what religion used to do.
 

00:22:44.868 --> 00:22:47.779
Poetry, you remember--this is a
scientist--

00:22:47.779 --> 00:22:53.323
is no more true than religion,
but it can perform the function

00:22:53.323 --> 00:22:58.048
of religion and is therefore
capable of saving us.

00:22:58.048 --> 00:23:02.977
And so even despite the seeming
derogation of the very thing

00:23:02.977 --> 00:23:07.486
that he purports to be
celebrating in books like The

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:10.660
Principles of Literary
Criticism,

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:16.482
Richards does hold on to an
extraordinarily important

00:23:16.482 --> 00:23:22.410
feeling for the mission of
poetry to harmonize conflicting

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:23.450
needs.
 

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:27.250
That's the role of poetry and
that's what it does,

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:33.068
simply by evoking our wishes,
our desires--

00:23:33.068 --> 00:23:36.970
irrespective of truth--in their
complicated,

00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:45.247
chaotic form and synthesizing
them organically into something

00:23:45.247 --> 00:23:50.490
that amounts to psychological
peace.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.618
It's a little bit like
Aristotle's idea of catharsis,

00:23:53.618 --> 00:23:56.048
which can be understood in a
variety of ways,

00:23:56.048 --> 00:23:58.596
but Milton at the end of
Samson Agonistes

00:23:58.596 --> 00:24:01.318
understands it in one way
when he says,

00:24:01.318 --> 00:24:05.869
Now we have as a result of this
tragedy "calm of mind,

00:24:05.869 --> 00:24:08.460
all passion spent."
 

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.778
That could be the motto for
Richards' work.

00:24:11.778 --> 00:24:14.778
The experience of art,
the experience of poetry,

00:24:14.778 --> 00:24:21.682
and the reconciliation of
conflicting needs results in a

00:24:21.682 --> 00:24:25.907
kind of catharsis,
a "calm of mind,

00:24:25.907 --> 00:24:27.799
all passion spent".
 

00:24:27.799 --> 00:24:28.750
All right.
 

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:32.653
Now Richards had a student,
an undergraduate student,

00:24:32.653 --> 00:24:35.130
William Empson,
who had, as I say,

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.410
been a math major who decided
he'd switch to English.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:43.519
He went to Richards and he said
he had an idea about ambiguity.

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:46.540
He said he felt there was quite
a bit that could be written

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.769
about it, and so he wondered if
Richards would mind if maybe he

00:24:49.769 --> 00:24:50.759
worked on that.
 

00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:52.200
Richards said, "Fine.
 

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.750
Fine.
 

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:53.299
Sounds terrific.
 

00:24:53.299 --> 00:24:54.450
Go do it."
 

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:58.183
So a few months later Empson
brought him the manuscript of

00:24:58.183 --> 00:25:01.721
one of the greatest books of
criticism in the twentieth

00:25:01.721 --> 00:25:04.932
century ,and one of the most
amazingly surprising:

00:25:04.932 --> 00:25:07.160
Seven Types of Ambiguity.
 

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.420
The brief excerpt you have
in your photocopy packet--

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:15.836
I trust that you have picked it
up by this time at Tyco [copy

00:25:15.836 --> 00:25:19.537
center]--
from Empson is taken from

00:25:19.537 --> 00:25:25.758
Seven Types of Ambiguity.
I think Empson is the funniest

00:25:25.758 --> 00:25:29.818
person who has ever written
literary criticism.

00:25:29.818 --> 00:25:34.825
I think that his deadpan way of
bringing things down to earth

00:25:34.825 --> 00:25:39.579
when they get a little too
highfalutin' involves the skill

00:25:39.579 --> 00:25:42.250
of a genuine stand-up comic.
 

00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.740
His timing is perfect.
 

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.406
He has, in other words,
all of the attributes of a

00:25:48.406 --> 00:25:49.980
great comic writer.
 

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.323
I've enjoyed reading him so
much that when I was asked to

00:25:53.323 --> 00:25:55.950
write a book about him,
I agreed to do so.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:57.950
I've always been like that.
 

00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.532
Byron was the only person I
enjoyed reading during the

00:26:01.532 --> 00:26:05.318
nail-biting and tense period of
studying for my orals.

00:26:05.318 --> 00:26:08.526
So I wrote my dissertation on
Byron as a result of

00:26:08.526 --> 00:26:12.190
that--nothing complicated,
no deep reason for doing these

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.910
things.
 

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:15.509
But Empson I hope you enjoy.
 

00:26:15.509 --> 00:26:19.271
He's a page-turner,
and his extraordinary

00:26:19.271 --> 00:26:25.104
brilliance as a critic is really
just part of the experience of

00:26:25.104 --> 00:26:26.608
reading him.
 

00:26:26.608 --> 00:26:33.022
I'm particularly interested in
the excerpt you have and what he

00:26:33.022 --> 00:26:37.657
does with his notions--
because this is his way of

00:26:37.657 --> 00:26:40.574
responding to
"enthusiastic"

00:26:40.574 --> 00:26:42.858
or appreciative criticism.
 

00:26:42.858 --> 00:26:45.361
One of the tricks of
"Q"

00:26:45.361 --> 00:26:49.378
and Billy Phelps and all the
other sort of authors and

00:26:49.378 --> 00:26:53.244
lecturers in this mode was to
say that they read for

00:26:53.244 --> 00:26:57.186
"atmosphere,"
that there was something that

00:26:57.186 --> 00:27:01.204
one just felt along one's
bloodstream or in the pulses

00:27:01.204 --> 00:27:04.920
when one encountered great
literature,

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:09.051
and their purpose as lecturers
and as critics was to evoke the

00:27:09.051 --> 00:27:10.608
atmosphere of things.
 

00:27:10.608 --> 00:27:12.676
So Empson says,
Well, atmosphere,

00:27:12.676 --> 00:27:16.423
certainly that exists and we
can talk about it in all sorts

00:27:16.423 --> 00:27:18.346
of ways;
but after all,

00:27:18.346 --> 00:27:20.890
what is the use of atmosphere?
 

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:24.025
What is the use of any aspect
of literature if,

00:27:24.025 --> 00:27:27.229
as good scientists,
we can't analyze it or can't

00:27:27.229 --> 00:27:29.818
somehow or another account for
it?

00:27:29.818 --> 00:27:34.132
If there is atmosphere in the
passage I'm about to quote from

00:27:34.132 --> 00:27:37.078
Macbeth,
it must be atmosphere of a

00:27:37.078 --> 00:27:40.529
certain kind and there for a
certain reason.

00:27:40.529 --> 00:27:42.702
What follows,
it seems to me,

00:27:42.702 --> 00:27:46.740
is one of the most staggeringly
beautiful, wonderful,

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:50.777
amazing riffs on a passage of
literature that you can

00:27:50.777 --> 00:27:52.019
encounter.
 

00:27:52.019 --> 00:27:55.271
I'm sorry if I sound a little
bit like Billy Phelps,

00:27:55.271 --> 00:27:56.740
but I do get excited.
 

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:01.680
He quotes the passage from
Macbeth.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.198
As Empson says,
the murderers have just left

00:28:05.198 --> 00:28:07.988
the room,
and Macbeth is sort of

00:28:07.988 --> 00:28:11.032
twiddling his thumbs,
hoping it's getting dark

00:28:11.032 --> 00:28:13.818
because it's got to get dark
before Banquo can be killed.

00:28:13.818 --> 00:28:15.098
So naturally he looks out the
window to see

00:28:15.098 --> 00:28:15.828
&gt;
 

00:28:15.828 --> 00:28:20.839
how the time is going,
and this is what he says:

00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:24.395
â€¦ Come, seeling Night,
Skarfe up the tender Eye of

00:28:24.395 --> 00:28:26.828
pitiful Day
And with thy bloodie and

00:28:26.828 --> 00:28:30.553
invisible Hand
Cancel and teare to pieces that

00:28:30.553 --> 00:28:33.500
great Bond
That keeps me pale!

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:36.166
Empson doesn't mention this
word, "pale,"

00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:39.261
but in juxtaposition with the
crows and rooks it strikes me

00:28:39.261 --> 00:28:42.410
that it itself is an interesting
moment in the passage.

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:44.990
Light thickens,
and the Crow

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.420
Makes Wing to th' Rookie
Wood.

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.634
Empson italicizes that because
while he has something to say

00:28:50.634 --> 00:28:53.142
about every part of the
passage--which all good

00:28:53.142 --> 00:28:55.048
criticism by the way should do.
 

00:28:55.048 --> 00:28:57.250
If you quote something,
say something about all of it.

00:28:57.250 --> 00:28:57.990
&gt;
 

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:03.124
Okay--but Empson italicizes
these particular lines because

00:29:03.124 --> 00:29:08.348
it's going to be the true focus
of what he'll say later.

00:29:08.348 --> 00:29:11.348
Good things of Day begin to
droope, and drowse,

00:29:11.348 --> 00:29:15.170
While Night's black Agents to
their Prey's do rowse.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.161
Thou marvell'st at my words,
but hold thee still [Lady

00:29:18.161 --> 00:29:20.079
Macbeth has come into the room];
 

00:29:24.019 --> 00:29:28.650
Things bad begun,
make strong themselves by ill:

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:30.329
So prythee go with me.
 

00:29:30.329 --> 00:29:30.960
All right.
 

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:35.122
So Empson is fascinated by this
passage, and then he gives you,

00:29:35.122 --> 00:29:38.948
in the next few paragraphs,
the amazing variety of grounds

00:29:38.948 --> 00:29:40.559
for his fascination.
 

00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:42.259
He says, Look.
 

00:29:42.259 --> 00:29:45.880
This is what people mean when
they talk about atmosphere.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:48.650
It's not just something you
feel on your pulse.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.709
It's something that can be
described, something that can be

00:29:51.709 --> 00:29:52.288
analyzed.
 

00:29:52.288 --> 00:29:55.088
And I just want to touch on the
last part of it.

00:29:55.088 --> 00:29:57.590
He says, "Rooks
live in a crowd and are mainly

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.929
vegetarianâ€¦"--
Empson's the person who says

00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:05.375
that the ancient mariner shot
the albatross because the crew

00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:06.430
was hungry.
 

00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:09.468
He points out that in the 1798
edition of The Rime of the

00:30:09.468 --> 00:30:12.094
Ancient Mariner,
biscuit worms had gotten

00:30:12.094 --> 00:30:13.996
into the hard-tack,
so naturally,

00:30:13.996 --> 00:30:16.817
he says, "The particular
kind of albatross that the

00:30:16.817 --> 00:30:19.200
mariner shot,
I am told, makes a very

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.710
tolerable broth."
 

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:21.359
&gt;
 

00:30:21.359 --> 00:30:23.588
&gt;
 

00:30:23.588 --> 00:30:25.589
This is the mode of William
Empson.

00:30:25.589 --> 00:30:29.430
So he begins here:
Rooks live in a crowd

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:32.800
and are mainly vegetarian;
Crow may be either another

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.393
name for rook,
especially when seen alone,

00:30:36.393 --> 00:30:39.759
or it may mean the solitary
Carrion crow.

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:44.298
This subdued pun [this
ambiguity--remember,

00:30:44.298 --> 00:30:50.469
this is a book about ambiguity]
is made to imply here that

00:30:50.469 --> 00:30:53.932
Macbeth,
looking out of the window,

00:30:53.932 --> 00:30:58.655
is trying to see himself as a
murderer and can only see

00:30:58.655 --> 00:31:03.990
himself in the position of the
crow: that his day of power now

00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:06.988
is closing;
that he has to distinguish

00:31:06.988 --> 00:31:10.185
himself from the other rooks by
a difference of name,

00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:12.585
rook-crow,
like the kingly title,

00:31:12.585 --> 00:31:15.563
only;
that he is anxious at bottom to

00:31:15.563 --> 00:31:19.298
be one with the other rooks,
not to murder them;

00:31:19.298 --> 00:31:22.275
that he can no longer,
or that he may yet,

00:31:22.275 --> 00:31:26.851
be united with the rookery;
and that he is murdering Banquo

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:30.519
in a forlorn attempt to obtain
peace of mind.

00:31:30.519 --> 00:31:36.053
I'm not at all sure there's
anything more to be said about

00:31:36.053 --> 00:31:40.519
that passage,
which I think lays it to rest.

00:31:40.519 --> 00:31:45.962
It does so by insisting on a
complex mode of ambiguity that

00:31:45.962 --> 00:31:49.529
governs the passage--not
atmosphere.

00:31:49.529 --> 00:31:50.951
Sure, call it
"atmosphere"

00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:53.462
if you like,
as long as you're willing to

00:31:53.462 --> 00:31:57.730
subject it to verbal analysis,
as long as you're willing to

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:02.436
show how and why the atmosphere
is exactly of the nature that it

00:32:02.436 --> 00:32:04.193
is,
and that it arises,

00:32:04.193 --> 00:32:08.380
in other words--
and here is the relationship

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:14.088
between Richards and Empson--
out of a complex state of mind;

00:32:14.088 --> 00:32:18.528
that poetry,
the poetry of this speaker,

00:32:18.528 --> 00:32:23.653
this speaker/murderer,
is attempting desperately to

00:32:23.653 --> 00:32:28.101
reconcile and harmonize,
just as he is attempting

00:32:28.101 --> 00:32:32.586
desperately to be reconciled and
harmonized with the society from

00:32:32.586 --> 00:32:35.319
which he has alienated himself
and,

00:32:35.319 --> 00:32:36.720
of course, is failing.
 

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.230
Macbeth is not Shakespeare.
 

00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:41.608
Shakespeare is representing him
in poetry,

00:32:41.608 --> 00:32:44.327
attempting to do something
which in the immediate

00:32:44.327 --> 00:32:46.990
psychological circumstances
poetry can't do,

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:52.433
but in the process evoking an
extraordinary complexity of

00:32:52.433 --> 00:32:58.073
effort on the part of the mind
to be reconciled through the

00:32:58.073 --> 00:33:00.308
medium of language.
 

00:33:00.308 --> 00:33:04.650
As I say, this is the sense in
which Empson follows Richards.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:08.298
But at the same time,
there's something rather

00:33:08.298 --> 00:33:10.568
different between the two.
 

00:33:10.568 --> 00:33:13.338
First of all,
Empson doesn't really kind of

00:33:13.338 --> 00:33:16.900
settle into a sense that it's
all about the reader--

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.983
that is to say,
that it's all about the

00:33:18.983 --> 00:33:21.068
reader's experience of the
literary.

00:33:21.068 --> 00:33:24.808
Richards is actually an avatar
of figures like Iser,

00:33:24.808 --> 00:33:28.000
like Hans Robert Jauss and
Stanley Fish--

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.848
whom we'll be discussing later
in the syllabus--

00:33:29.848 --> 00:33:33.670
who are interested in reader
response: that is to say,

00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:38.239
in the way in which we can talk
about the structure of reader

00:33:38.239 --> 00:33:39.230
experience.
 

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:44.644
Empson is sort of interested in
that, just as he's fascinated by

00:33:44.644 --> 00:33:48.170
the texture of textual evidence
itself.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.971
He is also very
interested--much more so than

00:33:51.971 --> 00:33:54.756
Richards,
and certainly more so than the

00:33:54.756 --> 00:33:58.191
New Critics from whom he sharply
diverges in advance in this

00:33:58.191 --> 00:34:01.405
respect--
interested in authorial

00:34:01.405 --> 00:34:03.983
intention;
that is to say,

00:34:03.983 --> 00:34:09.389
for him, literary criticism is
always an appeal to authorial

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:10.579
intention.
 

00:34:10.579 --> 00:34:14.389
Mind you, he ascribes to
authorial intention the most

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:18.788
amazingly outrageous things that
other critics threw up their

00:34:18.788 --> 00:34:23.297
hands in despair about,
but nevertheless it is for him

00:34:23.297 --> 00:34:27.150
always still an appeal to
authorial intention.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:31.702
At bottom, Empson doesn't
really settle into the rigorous

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:36.336
consideration of the author,
the text, or the reader as if

00:34:36.336 --> 00:34:39.018
they were separate functions.
 

00:34:39.018 --> 00:34:44.047
For Empson, there's a kind of a
fluid and easy movement back and

00:34:44.047 --> 00:34:47.958
forth between what for
hermeneutics are three very

00:34:47.958 --> 00:34:50.592
different phenomena:
author, text,

00:34:50.592 --> 00:34:51.630
reader.
 

00:34:51.630 --> 00:34:56.659
For Empson, it's a kind of
synthetic mélange

00:34:56.659 --> 00:35:01.309
that's ultimately an appeal
to the author,

00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:05.639
but certainly involves both
working on the text itself and

00:35:05.639 --> 00:35:09.210
also understanding its effects
on the reader.

00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:13.574
So all of this distances Empson
from Richards to a certain

00:35:13.574 --> 00:35:15.474
extent,
but the most important

00:35:15.474 --> 00:35:17.815
difference, I think,
between Empson and the other

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:20.673
figures we're discussing--
a difference which makes it

00:35:20.673 --> 00:35:24.690
even a little bit complex to say
that he's a precursor of the New

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:28.460
Criticism--
is that Empson very rarely

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:34.018
concerns himself with the
whole of a text.

00:35:34.018 --> 00:35:38.235
He isn't really interested in
the unity of "the

00:35:38.235 --> 00:35:39.309
poem."
 

00:35:39.309 --> 00:35:43.146
He is simply interested in
saying as much as he can about

00:35:43.146 --> 00:35:46.652
certain local effects,
certainly with the implication,

00:35:46.652 --> 00:35:49.242
possibly,
that this has a bearing on our

00:35:49.242 --> 00:35:51.516
understanding of,
let's say, the whole of

00:35:51.516 --> 00:35:54.146
Macbeth;
but he doesn't set about doing

00:35:54.146 --> 00:35:57.070
a systematic reading of the
whole of Macbeth.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.757
He always zooms in on
something, thinks about it for a

00:35:59.757 --> 00:36:02.800
while and then goes away and
thinks about something else,

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.594
leaving us to decide whether it
has a genuine bearing on the

00:36:07.594 --> 00:36:12.469
entirety or on the literary
wholeness or unity of Macbeth.

00:36:12.469 --> 00:36:17.139
Empson is interested in the
complexity of local effects.

00:36:17.139 --> 00:36:19.619
Another thing to say about
Empson's perspective,

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:21.789
which makes him differ sharply,
I think,

00:36:21.789 --> 00:36:24.380
from Richards and from the
later New Critics,

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:29.365
is that Empson is perfectly
willing to accommodate the idea

00:36:29.365 --> 00:36:32.065
that maybe--
just as in the case of the

00:36:32.065 --> 00:36:34.250
psychology of Macbeth the
character--

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:38.047
that maybe poetry
doesn't reconcile

00:36:38.047 --> 00:36:39.900
conflicting needs.
 

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.213
Maybe, after all,
poetry is an expression of the

00:36:44.213 --> 00:36:47.518
irreducible conflict of our
needs.

00:36:47.518 --> 00:36:50.960
The last chapter of Seven
Types of Ambiguity,

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:53.900
his seventh ambiguity,
is actually,

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:56.713
as Empson said,
about "some fundamental

00:36:56.713 --> 00:36:59.199
division in the writer's
mind."

00:36:59.199 --> 00:37:02.264
There, you see,
he diverges from his teacher,

00:37:02.264 --> 00:37:03.030
Richards.
 

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:08.170
He's fascinated by the way in
which literature doesn't unify

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:14.010
opposites or reconcile needs but
leaves things as it found them,

00:37:14.010 --> 00:37:17.300
but exposed in all of their
complexity.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.554
Paul de Man more than once
invoked Empson as a precursor of

00:37:21.554 --> 00:37:24.710
deconstruction,
not of the New Criticism.

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:28.061
For this reason--for the reason
that he's not concerned with

00:37:28.061 --> 00:37:31.074
unity and that he's not
concerned with the idea of the

00:37:31.074 --> 00:37:34.224
reconciliation of opposites--
Empson, I think,

00:37:34.224 --> 00:37:39.090
can rightly be understood as a
precursor of deconstruction,

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.079
if only because deconstruction
follows the New Criticism,

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:44.829
of course, in being a mode of
close reading;

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:51.639
and there has never been a
better close reader than Empson.

00:37:51.639 --> 00:37:55.088
Before turning away from
Empson, whose influence was

00:37:55.088 --> 00:37:57.659
widespread despite this
divergence,

00:37:57.659 --> 00:38:02.498
it needs to be said that his
purposes for close reading are

00:38:02.498 --> 00:38:07.840
actually very different from the
purposes of the New Critics--

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.543
the American New Critics,
particularly Brooks whose

00:38:11.543 --> 00:38:15.692
preoccupation with unity is
something he freely confesses

00:38:15.692 --> 00:38:19.817
and something that--
well, we've got ten minutes,

00:38:19.817 --> 00:38:23.170
so I shouldn't rush ahead
prematurely--

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:27.179
but something that you can see
to be at the heart of what

00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:28.469
Brooks is doing.
 

00:38:28.469 --> 00:38:33.539
Here Brooks,
in The Well-Wrought Urn,

00:38:33.539 --> 00:38:36.077
Modern Poetry and the
Tradition, and the

00:38:36.077 --> 00:38:38.039
other books for which he's well
known,

00:38:38.039 --> 00:38:42.306
uses a variety of different
words to describe the way in

00:38:42.306 --> 00:38:46.184
which the complexity of
literature is placed in the

00:38:46.184 --> 00:38:48.280
service of unification.
 

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.856
In the essay you're reading
here, he uses the word

00:38:50.856 --> 00:38:51.909
"irony."
 

00:38:51.909 --> 00:38:54.525
He admits that maybe he
stretches the word

00:38:54.525 --> 00:38:57.586
"irony,"
but he tries to argue that the

00:38:57.586 --> 00:39:01.224
variety of effects that he
focuses on in his essay have to

00:39:01.224 --> 00:39:02.500
do with irony.
 

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:05.201
In another great essay,
the first chapter of The

00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:07.739
Well-Wrought Urn,
he talks about paradox.

00:39:07.739 --> 00:39:10.150
Obviously, these are related
ideas,

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:15.733
and elsewhere he takes up other
ways of evoking the way in which

00:39:15.733 --> 00:39:20.429
complex feelings and thoughts
are brought together.

00:39:20.429 --> 00:39:22.713
Empson's word,
"ambiguity,"

00:39:22.713 --> 00:39:26.331
continues to play an important
role in the work of the New

00:39:26.331 --> 00:39:27.219
Criticism.
 

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:30.730
It is--at least,
it puts itself out there as a

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:35.409
candidate to be an alternative
term that one might use if one

00:39:35.409 --> 00:39:38.217
got tired of saying
"irony"

00:39:38.217 --> 00:39:40.480
or "paradox."
 

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.059
&gt;
 

00:39:41.059 --> 00:39:43.280
There are a variety of words,
in other words.

00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.849
Another word given by the poet
and critic Allen Tate,

00:39:45.849 --> 00:39:48.019
one of the founding figures of
the New Criticism,

00:39:48.019 --> 00:39:51.329
is "tension"--
that is to say,

00:39:51.329 --> 00:39:57.422
the way in which the literary
text resolves oppositions as a

00:39:57.422 --> 00:40:00.693
tension;
that is, a holding in

00:40:00.693 --> 00:40:05.369
suspension a conflict
experienced as tension.

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:09.755
So there are these varieties of
ways for describing what's going

00:40:09.755 --> 00:40:10.800
on in a text.
 

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:14.505
It's interesting I think that
if one thinks of Tony the Tow

00:40:14.505 --> 00:40:18.577
Truck one can think of--
when you go home and study it,

00:40:18.577 --> 00:40:22.594
you'll see what I mean--
there's a complex pattern of

00:40:22.594 --> 00:40:25.739
imagery,
as it were, between pulling and

00:40:25.739 --> 00:40:26.429
pushing.
 

00:40:26.429 --> 00:40:29.648
There's a tremendous amount of
pulling and pushing that goes on

00:40:29.648 --> 00:40:32.896
in Tony the Tow Truck.
We'll revert especially to the

00:40:32.896 --> 00:40:36.018
notion of "pushing"
in other contexts later in the

00:40:36.018 --> 00:40:38.594
course,
but for the moment you can see

00:40:38.594 --> 00:40:42.519
the way in which there is a
tension between that which pulls

00:40:42.519 --> 00:40:46.284
and that which pushes,
which is one of the motive

00:40:46.284 --> 00:40:47.929
forces of the story.
 

00:40:47.929 --> 00:40:50.663
That, I think,
is an example also:

00:40:50.663 --> 00:40:55.548
if it is ironic that
Tony is now stuck and instead of

00:40:55.548 --> 00:41:00.003
pulling needs to be pushed,
if it is in some Brooksian

00:41:00.003 --> 00:41:02.570
sense ironic that that is the
case,

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:11.969
we can understand that as irony
or as tension or ambiguity.

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:15.418
Now there's one way in which
Tony is probably not a

00:41:15.418 --> 00:41:17.840
good proof text for the New
Criticism.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:21.239
You remember that in "My
Credo," the little

00:41:21.239 --> 00:41:24.583
sort of excerpt that you get at
the beginning of the Brooks

00:41:24.583 --> 00:41:27.143
section in your anthology,
Brooks says,

00:41:27.143 --> 00:41:30.817
"Poetry should be about
moral things but it shouldn't

00:41:30.817 --> 00:41:32.300
point a moral."
 

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:38.164
Obviously Tony the Tow Truck
points a moral and so would

00:41:38.164 --> 00:41:43.273
be subject to a kind of
devaluation on those grounds by

00:41:43.273 --> 00:41:47.217
the New Criticism--
even though there are ways of

00:41:47.217 --> 00:41:50.117
reading Tony,
as I've been suggesting,

00:41:50.117 --> 00:41:51.219
New Critic-ally.
 

00:41:51.219 --> 00:41:52.780
All right.
 

00:41:52.780 --> 00:41:56.963
Now the idea of unity for
Brooks, and for the New Critics

00:41:56.963 --> 00:42:00.143
in general,
is that it be complex,

00:42:00.143 --> 00:42:04.119
that it warp the statements of
science,

00:42:04.119 --> 00:42:09.541
and that it bring to bear a
tension between the denotation

00:42:09.541 --> 00:42:12.489
and the connotation of words.
 

00:42:12.489 --> 00:42:14.875
The word "yellow"
in the second line of Tony

00:42:14.875 --> 00:42:17.543
the Tow Truck--
its denotation is that it

00:42:17.543 --> 00:42:21.731
is a certain color,
the color that Tony's garage is

00:42:21.731 --> 00:42:22.539
painted.
 

00:42:22.539 --> 00:42:24.989
The connotation,
I have suggested,

00:42:24.989 --> 00:42:30.811
is of the variety of kinds that
one might gingerly approach in

00:42:30.811 --> 00:42:36.059
thinking about complicating the
texture of the story.

00:42:36.059 --> 00:42:39.536
In any case,
the tension between denotation

00:42:39.536 --> 00:42:44.340
and connotation is part of the
way in which irony works.

00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:47.918
So the question again is--and
the question it seems to me

00:42:47.918 --> 00:42:51.677
raised in advance by Empson--
why should these sorts of

00:42:51.677 --> 00:42:55.449
tension, these movements of
complex reconciliation,

00:42:55.449 --> 00:42:57.889
result in unity?
 

00:42:57.889 --> 00:42:59.699
It's very interesting.
 

00:42:59.699 --> 00:43:02.422
Brooks's reading of "She
Dwelt Among Untrodden

00:43:02.422 --> 00:43:05.309
Ways," the wonderful Lucy
poem by Wordsworth,

00:43:05.309 --> 00:43:08.239
emphasizes the irony of the
poem.

00:43:08.239 --> 00:43:11.409
Brooks feels that he's on very
thin ice talking about

00:43:11.409 --> 00:43:15.516
Wordsworth and irony at all,
but at the same time does bring

00:43:15.516 --> 00:43:19.746
it out rather beautifully,
talking about the irony of the

00:43:19.746 --> 00:43:24.126
poem basically as the way in
which you can't really say that

00:43:24.126 --> 00:43:27.840
Lucy can be a flower and a star
simultaneously.

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.885
She's a flower,
she's perishable,

00:43:29.885 --> 00:43:33.659
she's half hidden,
and she's ultimately dead and

00:43:33.659 --> 00:43:37.132
in the ground--
whereas a star would seem to be

00:43:37.132 --> 00:43:41.123
something that she just can't be
mapped onto if she is this

00:43:41.123 --> 00:43:42.570
half-hidden thing.
 

00:43:42.570 --> 00:43:44.036
But at the same time,
Brooks says,

00:43:44.036 --> 00:43:46.547
"Well,
after all she is a star to the

00:43:46.547 --> 00:43:48.940
speaker,"
and he's just saying,

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.067
"She's a star to me;
she's a flower half hidden,

00:43:52.067 --> 00:43:54.570
unnoticed to everyone
else."

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:58.757
The relationship between the
depth of the speaker's feeling

00:43:58.757 --> 00:44:03.018
and the obscurity of Lucy in the
world is the irony that the

00:44:03.018 --> 00:44:07.494
speaker wants to lay hold of and
that reconciles what seem like

00:44:07.494 --> 00:44:09.949
disparate facts in the poem.
 

00:44:09.949 --> 00:44:14.715
Well, now I just want to point
out that close reading can

00:44:14.715 --> 00:44:17.610
always be pushed farther.
 

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:20.170
That's the difficulty about
close reading.

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:22.860
It's all very well to say,
"Look at me,

00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:27.409
I'm reconciling harmonies,
I'm creating patterns,

00:44:27.409 --> 00:44:31.452
I'm showing the purpose of
image clusters and all the rest

00:44:31.452 --> 00:44:34.360
of it," but if you keep
doing it,

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:38.880
what you have yoked together
becomes unyoked again.

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.003
It falls apart,
or at least it threatens to do

00:44:42.003 --> 00:44:42.349
so.
 

00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:46.480
A contemporary of Brooks's
named F.W. Bateson wrote an

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.221
essay on this same poem,
"She Dwelt Among Untrodden

00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:51.989
Ways," in which he points
out--

00:44:51.989 --> 00:45:02.070
the poem's on page 802--that
the poem is full of oxymorons,

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:06.469
contradictions in terms:
"untrodden ways."

00:45:06.469 --> 00:45:09.112
A "way"
is a path, but how can there be

00:45:09.112 --> 00:45:10.710
a path if it's not trodden?
 

00:45:10.710 --> 00:45:14.230
What is the meaning of an
untrodden way,

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:18.893
or of "there are none to
praise" her but "very

00:45:18.893 --> 00:45:20.449
few to love"?
 

00:45:20.449 --> 00:45:23.516
Why call attention not so much
to the difference between

00:45:23.516 --> 00:45:26.583
"few love her"
and "none praise her"

00:45:26.583 --> 00:45:28.760
as the notion that none praise
her?

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.326
This is palpably false because
here's the poet praising her,

00:45:32.326 --> 00:45:32.809
right?
 

00:45:32.809 --> 00:45:34.789
So what does he mean,
"none"?

00:45:34.789 --> 00:45:37.708
Why is he calling attention,
in other words,

00:45:37.708 --> 00:45:39.610
to this logical disparity?
 

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:44.115
"She lived unknown and few
could know"--how can she be

00:45:44.115 --> 00:45:47.050
unknown if few know anything
about her?

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:49.737
In other words,
the poem is full of

00:45:49.737 --> 00:45:52.820
complexities,
but who says they're being

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.559
reconciled?
 

00:45:54.559 --> 00:45:57.460
They're just sitting there
oxymoronically,

00:45:57.460 --> 00:46:00.010
not reconciling themselves at
all.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:06.304
So Bateson's argument is that
Wordsworth is calling attention

00:46:06.304 --> 00:46:11.340
to a conflict of emotion or
feeling that can't be

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.809
reconciled,
hence the pathos of the ending,

00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:17.436
"[O]h,
/ the difference to me,"

00:46:17.436 --> 00:46:18.150
and so on.
 

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.476
This, as I say,
is a different use of close

00:46:21.476 --> 00:46:22.268
reading.
 

00:46:22.268 --> 00:46:26.797
It's close reading which is not
in the service of unity or of

00:46:26.797 --> 00:46:31.402
unification but recognizes that
the very arts whereby we see a

00:46:31.402 --> 00:46:35.628
thing as a unified whole can
just as easily be put to the

00:46:35.628 --> 00:46:38.800
purpose of blasting it apart
again,

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:45.179
and of calling our attention to
that which can't be reconciled

00:46:45.179 --> 00:46:51.768
just as the speaker can't be
reconciled to the death of Lucy.

00:46:51.768 --> 00:46:57.072
Now the New Critics can,
I think, be criticized for that

00:46:57.072 --> 00:46:57.940
reason.
 

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:02.543
The aftermath of--the
historical close reading

00:47:02.543 --> 00:47:05.460
aftermath of--
the New Criticism does

00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:09.559
precisely that,
if one sees deconstruction as a

00:47:09.559 --> 00:47:12.670
response to the New Criticism.
 

00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:14.228
It's not just that,
as we'll see,

00:47:14.228 --> 00:47:16.030
it's a great many other things
too.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:18.610
The deconstructive response
consists essentially in saying,

00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:19.190
"Look.
 

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:22.228
You can't just arbitrarily tie
a ribbon around something and

00:47:22.228 --> 00:47:22.949
say, 'Ah ha.
 

00:47:22.949 --> 00:47:24.360
It's a unity.'" Right?
 

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.369
The ribbon comes off.
 

00:47:26.369 --> 00:47:27.300
&gt;
 

00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.396
"Things fly apart,"
as the poet says,

00:47:30.396 --> 00:47:32.619
and it's not a unity after all.
 

00:47:32.619 --> 00:47:36.905
There is another aspect of the
way in which the New Criticism

00:47:36.905 --> 00:47:41.478
has been criticized for the last
forty or fifty years which needs

00:47:41.478 --> 00:47:42.980
to be touched on.
 

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:47.329
The notion of autonomy,
the notion of the freedom of

00:47:47.329 --> 00:47:51.849
the poem from any kind of
dependence in the world,

00:47:51.849 --> 00:47:56.840
is something that is very easy
to undermine critically.

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.992
Think of Brooks's analysis of
Randall Jarrell's "Eighth

00:48:00.992 --> 00:48:02.260
Air Force."
 

00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:06.398
It concludes on the last page
of the essay by saying that this

00:48:06.398 --> 00:48:10.327
is a poem about human nature,
about human nature under

00:48:10.327 --> 00:48:14.650
stress, and whether or not human
nature is or is not good;

00:48:14.650 --> 00:48:19.300
and arguments of this kind,
arguments of the kind set forth

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:23.949
by the poem, "can make
better citizens of us."

00:48:23.949 --> 00:48:26.099
In other words,
the experience of reading

00:48:26.099 --> 00:48:28.518
poetry is not just an aesthetic
experience.

00:48:28.518 --> 00:48:31.416
It's not just a question of
private reconciliation of

00:48:31.416 --> 00:48:32.530
conflicting needs.
 

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:35.746
It's a social
experience, in this view,

00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:39.748
and the social experience is
intrinsically a conservative

00:48:39.748 --> 00:48:40.320
one.
 

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.012
In other words,
it insists on the need to

00:48:44.012 --> 00:48:47.532
balance opinions,
to balance viewpoints,

00:48:47.532 --> 00:48:51.317
and to balance needs,
precisely in a way which is,

00:48:51.317 --> 00:48:55.757
of course,
implicitly a kind of social and

00:48:55.757 --> 00:48:58.059
political centrism.
 

00:48:58.059 --> 00:49:01.052
In other words,
how can poetry in this

00:49:01.052 --> 00:49:04.449
view--how can literature be
progressive?

00:49:04.449 --> 00:49:06.440
For that matter,
how can it be reactionary?

00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:10.054
How, in other words,
can it be put to political

00:49:10.054 --> 00:49:13.199
purposes if there is this
underlying,

00:49:13.199 --> 00:49:18.929
implicit centrism in this
notion of reconciliation,

00:49:18.929 --> 00:49:21.518
harmonization, and balance?
 

00:49:21.518 --> 00:49:26.586
That has been a frequent source
of the criticism of the New

00:49:26.586 --> 00:49:32.179
Criticism in its afterlife over
the last forty or fifty years.

00:49:32.179 --> 00:49:34.000
There's also the question of
religion.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.070
There is a kind of implicit
Episcopalian perspective that

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:39.922
you see in Brooks's essay when
he's talking about the

00:49:39.922 --> 00:49:44.552
Shakespeare poem,
in which, under the aspect of

00:49:44.552 --> 00:49:48.815
eternity,
inevitably things here on earth

00:49:48.815 --> 00:49:50.059
seem ironic.
 

00:49:50.059 --> 00:49:50.730
&gt;
 

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:55.773
There's always that play of
thought throughout the thinking

00:49:55.773 --> 00:49:58.469
of the New Criticism as well.
 

00:49:58.469 --> 00:50:01.969
Naturally, one will think of
things in ironic terms if one

00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:05.713
sees them from the perspective
of the divine or of the eternal

00:50:05.713 --> 00:50:06.389
moment.

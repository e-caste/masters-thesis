00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:05.648
Prof: And with that,
I'd like to turn to our subject

00:00:05.648 --> 00:00:10.075
for the morning,
which is about the third--it's

00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:15.890
the third in our series of
lectures on bubonic plague,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.960
and I'd like to talk about the
effects,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.078
or some of the effects,
of bubonic plaque on European

00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:23.870
culture.
 

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:28.445
We've been trying to suggest
that plague had a major impact

00:00:28.445 --> 00:00:32.589
on European society,
and I want to be arguing that

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:37.408
that impact was felt not only on
political events but also on

00:00:37.408 --> 00:00:42.413
culture and intellectual life,
and I'd like to look at that

00:00:42.413 --> 00:00:43.550
this morning.
 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.426
But I want us to remember that
when we're talking about those

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:51.504
effects,
I'll be trying to say it was

00:00:51.504 --> 00:00:55.640
the effects not only of plague
itself as a disease,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.820
but also the impact of the
organized reaction to plague,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.251
the anti-plague measures,
and the sense that for the

00:01:04.251 --> 00:01:07.750
first time society had means
that were effective,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.932
and could protect itself
against this dreadful outside

00:01:12.932 --> 00:01:13.909
visitor.
 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.909
Well, let's start again at the
beginning.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.414
And, as you know,
there is a biblical

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:24.989
interpretation for the themes of
this course.

00:01:24.989 --> 00:01:28.989
And this is the one that you're
now well familiar with;

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:30.780
this is the Fall.
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.595
This is Adam and Eve,
as painted by the greatest of

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.739
all--
perhaps the greatest of

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:40.944
all--plague painters,
Jacopo Tintoretto,

00:01:40.944 --> 00:01:46.440
who was a painter in Venice and
lived from 1518 to 1594.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.620
You know this is the story of
Genesis;

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.340
that Adam and Eve tasted of the
fruit that they were forbidden,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.268
and as a result they were
expelled from the garden and for

00:02:00.268 --> 00:02:03.900
the first time became subject to
death,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.540
and also to disease and illness.
 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.460
And if we move forward,
this is the next step.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.628
You saw the original sin.
 

00:02:14.628 --> 00:02:19.286
This is Masaccio's--one of the
great painters of the Italian

00:02:19.286 --> 00:02:21.992
Renaissance--
this is his painting,

00:02:21.992 --> 00:02:24.750
in the Brancacci Chapel in
Florence,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.699
of the expulsion from the
garden.

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.720
And you know they're looking
extremely miserable.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.497
Not only are they going to die
and become ill and experience

00:02:35.497 --> 00:02:39.230
pain in childbirth,
but they're also--and I'm sorry

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.628
about this--
they're going to have to work.

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:45.625
So this is a tremendously
painful experience,

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:49.893
and you can see the pain
written in their faces,

00:02:49.893 --> 00:02:51.710
of Adam and Eve.
 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.180
So that, in a way,
is a story of our course.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.885
And I'd like to talk now about
some attitudes towards what

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:03.848
followed--that is,
illness and death--just before

00:03:03.848 --> 00:03:06.740
the arrival of the Black Death.
 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.437
And I'd like to refer to the
work of a French historian who

00:03:11.437 --> 00:03:15.246
died fairly recently and was the
great, perhaps,

00:03:15.246 --> 00:03:17.110
historian of death.
 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.443
His name is Phillippe Ari�s,
and he had an idea,

00:03:21.443 --> 00:03:26.574
that before the Black Death,
he talked of it as "death

00:03:26.574 --> 00:03:27.990
tamed."
 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.259
That is, there were ways that
people had beliefs,

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.708
practices and rituals,
that helped them to face the

00:03:36.708 --> 00:03:41.690
issue of our mortality;
to cope with loss;

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.448
to heal the tear that was
caused in a family or a

00:03:45.448 --> 00:03:49.050
community, the loss of a member
of a family;

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.229
and also to express grief and
to pay one's last respects.

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:58.128
And there were two great aids
in doing that.

00:03:58.128 --> 00:04:01.664
One we might say was the ars
moriendi,

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:04.960
which was "the art of
dying."

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.768
There were certain rules that
you should be aware of that

00:04:08.768 --> 00:04:13.050
would prepare you for the final
moment and the passage from this

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.479
life to the next.
 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:18.233
And then there were what were
called a memento mori,

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:22.386
which is a reminder of death;
that is, a reminder--you should

00:04:22.386 --> 00:04:26.750
surround yourself with reminders
that it's time to get ready,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.425
because any day could be the
last and death could come very

00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:33.110
soon.
 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.839
We'll see the art of dying
portrayed in instructions;

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:41.019
sometimes in paintings or
engravings;

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:45.182
also in books on how to die
properly, according to Christian

00:04:45.182 --> 00:04:49.300
doctrine--who should be there?;
what are the last rites?;

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.600
that is, extreme unction--the
final confessions of sins;

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.810
the last communion and viaticum;
the funeral rites;

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.528
the laying out of the body;
the wake;

00:05:01.528 --> 00:05:04.786
the procession,
with perhaps a town crier

00:05:04.786 --> 00:05:08.716
announcing the event;
the funeral service and a

00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:13.574
burial ceremony with a blessing;
an interment in consecrated

00:05:13.574 --> 00:05:16.923
ground;
and finally a funeral meal for

00:05:16.923 --> 00:05:19.910
surviving friends and relatives.
 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.470
Leading themes in this are
themes of solidarity,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.819
dignity and community.
 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:32.170
And in this slide of the ars
moriendi,

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.673
we see a dying person
inhabiting two worlds:

00:05:35.673 --> 00:05:40.399
the natural world he's about to
leave with possessions,

00:05:40.399 --> 00:05:44.456
friends, family and home,
and a supernatural world he's

00:05:44.456 --> 00:05:48.259
about to enter,
and that only he can see,

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:54.139
but is represented by angels
and devils vying for his soul.

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:59.312
We can also see in another
example by Nicolas Poussin,

00:05:59.312 --> 00:06:03.901
also a great seventeenth
century French painter,

00:06:03.901 --> 00:06:08.490
who--this is a painting of
extreme unction.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.694
It's an illustration of the
good death to which everyone

00:06:13.694 --> 00:06:15.209
should aspire.
 

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:21.579
Now, the seventeenth century,
the time of Defoe's great work,

00:06:21.579 --> 00:06:26.675
also witnessed in Britain the
publication of the work of one

00:06:26.675 --> 00:06:31.425
of the most famous of all
writers on the theme of ars

00:06:31.425 --> 00:06:34.589
moriendi,
the art of dying;

00:06:34.589 --> 00:06:38.399
that was the extraordinary
Anglican preacher and bishop,

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:44.410
Jeremy Taylor,
who lived from 1613 to 1667,

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:48.572
and wrote two major works,
both of which have gone through

00:06:48.572 --> 00:06:52.512
edition after edition,
they were so popular and so

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:53.529
influential.
 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:58.360
The first was called The
Rule and Exercises of Holy

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.827
Living, of 1650,
and the other was The Rule

00:07:02.827 --> 00:07:06.838
and Exercise of Holy Dying,
of 1651.

00:07:06.838 --> 00:07:12.600
Taylor argued that this life is
short and unimportant,

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:18.283
and so we should use our time
primarily to prepare for the

00:07:18.283 --> 00:07:22.343
eternal world,
making certain that we die with

00:07:22.343 --> 00:07:25.089
our worldly affairs in good
order,

00:07:25.089 --> 00:07:29.259
and with our souls in a state
of grace,

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:33.319
prepared to meet our maker on
Judgment Day.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:38.478
His books then were
instructional manuals on how to

00:07:38.478 --> 00:07:39.509
do that.
 

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:43.790
And he reminds us that there
really isn't a moment to waste,

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:49.230
especially with the threat of
plague ever-present,

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:53.940
with sudden death that could
happen any moment now.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.906
So, Phillippe Ari�s thinks
then the opposite of the good

00:07:59.906 --> 00:08:03.569
death is death by bubonic
plague.

00:08:03.569 --> 00:08:08.732
That is something we might call
"death unleashed,"

00:08:08.732 --> 00:08:13.720
a sudden mass death for which
society had no defenses,

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.300
and no one was prepared.
 

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.706
This sudden death is mors
repentina--sudden

00:08:22.706 --> 00:08:26.350
death--which was always feared.
 

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:30.379
Because sudden death catches a
person unprepared,

00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:33.840
with his will unwritten in this
world,

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.460
and his soul in a state of sin
that could lead to eternal

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:40.440
damnation in the next.
 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:44.024
And death from plague was not
only sudden but,

00:08:44.024 --> 00:08:47.610
as we know now,
agonizing and dehumanizing.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.828
It often meant that the
sufferer was alone and

00:08:50.828 --> 00:08:53.596
abandoned,
and it was death without the

00:08:53.596 --> 00:08:57.445
attentions of the clergy,
without funeral rites and

00:08:57.445 --> 00:08:58.690
proper burial.
 

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:03.047
Or your body was hurled
unceremoniously into a mass

00:09:03.047 --> 00:09:05.620
plague pit;
burned perhaps;

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:10.028
thrown into the sea,
picked over by vultures and

00:09:10.028 --> 00:09:10.778
crows.
 

00:09:10.778 --> 00:09:14.568
Now, remember,
don't think that this fear of

00:09:14.568 --> 00:09:19.152
mors repentina was
something medieval and very

00:09:19.152 --> 00:09:23.028
distant from us,
or simply early modern.

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:26.808
The historian Drew Faust,
in her extraordinary recent

00:09:26.808 --> 00:09:30.934
book on the American Civil War,
This Republic of

00:09:30.934 --> 00:09:34.594
Suffering,
places the fear precisely of

00:09:34.594 --> 00:09:39.472
mors repentina at the
center of her account of the

00:09:39.472 --> 00:09:40.779
Civil War.
 

00:09:40.779 --> 00:09:46.268
It was a widespread anxiety,
pervasive among the soldiers on

00:09:46.268 --> 00:09:51.509
both sides of the conflict,
and it recurred again and again

00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:54.038
in the letters they wrote home.
 

00:09:54.038 --> 00:09:59.714
Total war, like bubonic plague,
provides unlimited opportunity

00:09:59.714 --> 00:10:05.110
for an unprepared and sudden
death that could set us all on

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.460
the wrong path for eternal life.
 

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.433
Well, literature also gives
expression to this new and

00:10:12.433 --> 00:10:14.009
horrifying reality.
 

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:17.070
You've seen Boccaccio in his
introduction to The

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.048
Decameron.
 

00:10:18.048 --> 00:10:21.360
You're reading Defoe and The
Journal of the Plague Year.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.839
You could read about it again
in Camus' The Plague,

00:10:25.839 --> 00:10:30.081
or Edgar Allan Poe's short
story, "Mask of the Red

00:10:30.081 --> 00:10:31.340
Death."
 

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:36.488
Remember too that another
aspect of mors repentina,

00:10:36.488 --> 00:10:41.275
the sudden unprepared death,
was the fear of premature

00:10:41.275 --> 00:10:42.269
burial.
 

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:46.503
The certification of death in
the early modern world,

00:10:46.503 --> 00:10:50.330
say at the time Defoe was
writing, was extremely

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.470
imprecise.
 

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:56.940
The only really certain
indication was putrefaction.

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.000
And, so, those religious rites
of laying out--

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.620
the wake, the funeral
procession and so forth--

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.740
were practical,
in that they allowed time,

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.845
and they ensured observation,
to be certain that the dead

00:11:11.845 --> 00:11:16.129
person really was dead before
being interred.

00:11:16.129 --> 00:11:20.139
But plague, on the other
hand--we've seen the plague

00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:21.240
regulations.
 

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.416
They meant instead a rapid,
hasty burial,

00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:28.386
with no attention and no
observation, and isolation

00:11:28.386 --> 00:11:32.120
raised a real danger of being
buried alive.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.297
In times of epidemic diseases
that swept populations,

00:11:37.297 --> 00:11:41.279
this fear of death was very
pervasive.

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:44.303
And we'll come back to it when
we talk about cholera in the

00:11:44.303 --> 00:11:47.639
nineteenth century,
when the cemeteries had all

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:52.019
sorts of experiments with
providing caskets with little

00:11:52.019 --> 00:11:55.750
bells above ground and a rope
underground,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:12:00.366
so that someone could raise the
alarm if they woke up

00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:01.700
unexpectedly.
 

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.120
So, the plague then really led
to death unleashed.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.673
Let's look at some of the
portrayals of it,

00:12:09.673 --> 00:12:14.244
in painting and sculpture,
from the plague centuries of

00:12:14.244 --> 00:12:18.730
the second pandemic--remember,
from 1347 to 1743.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:23.558
Here's a bas-relief of Pierre
Puget.

00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:29.676
This was the plague in
Marseilles, and I think one can

00:12:29.676 --> 00:12:33.600
see the extraordinary portrayal.
 

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.712
I wanted to move on though to
this particular painting,

00:12:37.712 --> 00:12:41.370
one of the most important of
the plague years.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.610
And this again is Poussin,
whom you saw earlier telling

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:49.433
you how to die properly,
what the good death should look

00:12:49.433 --> 00:12:51.638
like,
who should be there and all the

00:12:51.638 --> 00:12:51.990
rest.
 

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:56.720
This is his famous painting of
1631, now in the Louvre in

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.860
Paris, called "The Plague
of Ashdod."

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:04.159
Let me remind you,
it's again a biblically

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.769
inspired painting.
 

00:13:05.769 --> 00:13:08.700
Let me remind you of what
Ashdod was.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.875
The story is from the First
Book of Samuel in the Old

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:13.840
Testament.
 

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:18.221
Ashdod was a city in the Holy
Land near Gaza,

00:13:18.221 --> 00:13:24.096
occupied in biblical times by
the Philistines who worshipped

00:13:24.096 --> 00:13:25.990
the idol Dagon.
 

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.950
The Philistines defied the
Israelites in battle,

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:35.210
and confiscated the Arc of the
Covenant as war bootie,

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:40.019
and set it up in the Temple of
Dagon in Ashdod.

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:46.009
So, the Book of Samuel tells
us: "And so it was.

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:49.716
The hand of the Lord was
against the city,

00:13:49.716 --> 00:13:52.610
with a very great destruction.
 

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:57.620
And the Lord smote the men of
the city, both small and great,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:01.879
and they had emerods in their
secret parts."

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:05.990
A special reward to any of you
who tell me what an emerod

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.019
actually is.
 

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:11.049
But anyway, this slide is about
the destruction of the great

00:14:11.049 --> 00:14:12.279
temple of Dagon.
 

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:13.980
You can see that here.
 

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.480
This may be the Arc of the
Covenant.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.517
It is, then--again we can see
it's a representation in

00:14:23.517 --> 00:14:29.219
painting of plague as being a
punishment for divine anger and

00:14:29.219 --> 00:14:30.360
for sin.
 

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:35.625
Some of the things we can note
are the gruesome and particular

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:36.490
details.
 

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.908
We can see that there are rats
scurrying.

00:14:40.908 --> 00:14:43.870
You know the role that rats
played in plague.

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:49.158
Let's look--here we can see our
friend Rattus rattus

00:14:49.158 --> 00:14:51.529
playing a starring role.
 

00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:55.210
Or let's notice,
again in the foreground,

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:59.590
the attempt--the terrifying,
haunting attempt--

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:03.908
of a baby to suckle its mother
who's dying--

00:15:03.908 --> 00:15:07.158
I'm sorry, that was in the
preceding,

00:15:07.158 --> 00:15:10.080
and that's here in the
foreground.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:15.009
And we'll look at this person
here.

00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:20.500
And we can see the passerby
holding his nose because of the

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.950
stench of the victims and the
fear of miasma.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.399
Or let's look at another
portrayal.

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:32.918
And this is Pietro Gaetano
"The Plague of the

00:15:32.918 --> 00:15:35.288
Late-Seventeenth Century."
 

00:15:35.288 --> 00:15:41.673
Or quite a terrifying picture
by Micco Spadara,

00:15:41.673 --> 00:15:47.639
"The Plague of Naples in
1656."

00:15:47.639 --> 00:15:50.451
While we look at this,
let's think of the reference

00:15:50.451 --> 00:15:51.519
that it's making.
 

00:15:51.519 --> 00:15:54.779
You can see that things are
happening in the heavens.

00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:59.288
And this is Naples being
devastated by the plague.

00:15:59.288 --> 00:16:02.658
There are plague pits and all
the rest of it in this picture.

00:16:02.658 --> 00:16:06.528
I think we should remember how
people thought of this.

00:16:06.528 --> 00:16:10.796
It seemed to be an acting-out
of the Book of Revelations,

00:16:10.796 --> 00:16:12.928
the day of the Apocalypse.
 

00:16:12.928 --> 00:16:15.807
The Dies Irae,
the day of wrath,

00:16:15.807 --> 00:16:19.894
and the Lord's judgment,
when the lamb opened the Great

00:16:19.894 --> 00:16:24.460
Book, closed with seven seals;
and that's the reference in

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:27.629
Bergman's film to The Seventh
Seal.

00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:31.760
And in the Book of Revelations,
let me remind you of what

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.860
people were thinking at times
like this.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.203
In Chapter VI it says:
"And I saw when the lamb

00:16:39.203 --> 00:16:41.418
opened one of the seals.
 

00:16:41.418 --> 00:16:45.389
And I saw him behold there was
a white horse.

00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:49.049
And he that sat on him had a
bow, and he went forth

00:16:49.049 --> 00:16:51.100
conquering and to conquer.
 

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.440
And when he'd opened the second
seal,

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.980
there went out another horse
that was red,

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:00.225
and power was given to him that
sat thereon to take peace from

00:17:00.225 --> 00:17:02.812
the earth,
that they should kill one

00:17:02.812 --> 00:17:03.418
another.
 

00:17:03.418 --> 00:17:07.423
And when he had opened the
third seal, I beheld a black

00:17:07.423 --> 00:17:11.721
horse, and he that sat on him
had a pair of balances in his

00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:12.390
hand.
 

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.598
And he opened the fourth seal.
 

00:17:14.598 --> 00:17:19.991
I looked and beheld a pale
horse, and he that sat on him

00:17:19.991 --> 00:17:24.108
was death, and hell followed
with him...

00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:28.666
At last the lamb opened the
seventh seal and seven angels

00:17:28.666 --> 00:17:31.759
appeared, bringing the wrath of
God.

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:35.579
There was thunder,
lightening and earthquake.

00:17:35.579 --> 00:17:37.829
The sea turned to blood.
 

00:17:37.829 --> 00:17:40.029
The grasses were burned up.
 

00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:41.880
The waters turned to wormwood.
 

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:46.730
The sun and moon were smitten
and a bottomless pit opened.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:51.567
And I saw another sign in the
heavens, great and marvelous:

00:17:51.567 --> 00:17:55.490
seven angels bringing the seven
last plagues.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:17:59.269
For in them is filled up the
wrath of God.

00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:04.275
And I heard a great voice out
of the temple saying to the

00:18:04.275 --> 00:18:08.117
seven angels,
'Go your ways and pour out the

00:18:08.117 --> 00:18:12.230
vials of the wrath of God upon
the earth'.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:16.288
And the seventh angel poured
out his vial into the air.

00:18:16.288 --> 00:18:21.294
And thence came a great voice
saying, 'It is done.'"

00:18:21.294 --> 00:18:26.118
I think that's what's happening
in the heavens here.

00:18:26.118 --> 00:18:32.662
Well, other examples of death
unleashed are portrayed in the

00:18:32.662 --> 00:18:38.872
theme that was common in
European painting in the time of

00:18:38.872 --> 00:18:42.911
bubonic plague,
during the plague centuries,

00:18:42.911 --> 00:18:45.970
and that's the theme of the
triumph of death,

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:50.558
which is often complete with
the horsemen of the Apocalypse,

00:18:50.558 --> 00:18:55.507
that I just read to you about,
and a usual scene is a great

00:18:55.507 --> 00:18:57.567
cart,
pulled by oxen,

00:18:57.567 --> 00:19:02.403
driven by the figure of death,
wielding a great scythe,

00:19:02.403 --> 00:19:06.741
while before him there goes the
Angel of Death blowing a

00:19:06.741 --> 00:19:07.608
trumpet.
 

00:19:07.608 --> 00:19:12.141
And all around you may see dead
people and graves that are

00:19:12.141 --> 00:19:14.048
opening and skeletons.
 

00:19:14.048 --> 00:19:21.200
Let me give you one of the
scariest paintings I know.

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:25.432
This is Pieter Bruegel the
Elder, who lived in the

00:19:25.432 --> 00:19:27.160
sixteenth century.
 

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.978
And this is "The Triumph
of Death,"

00:19:30.978 --> 00:19:34.190
now hanging in the Prado in
Madrid.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:38.122
And if you look at the details,
I think it becomes all the more

00:19:38.122 --> 00:19:40.660
disturbing, the closer you look
at it.

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:46.022
You see death coming with his
scythe and mowing down the

00:19:46.022 --> 00:19:51.386
population in their masses,
which is what bubonic plague

00:19:51.386 --> 00:19:53.630
does in particular.
 

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.880
We can look at another artist.
 

00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:00.646
This is Andrea Mantegna,
who died in 1506,

00:20:00.646 --> 00:20:06.230
his painting "The Triumph
of Death."

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:11.013
There were other new themes in
European art that emerged during

00:20:11.013 --> 00:20:12.788
the plague centuries.
 

00:20:12.788 --> 00:20:15.817
And one of these,
that I'll show in a

00:20:15.817 --> 00:20:20.021
minute--which is not this--but
will be the theme of

00:20:20.021 --> 00:20:23.980
vanitas;
a new theme in European art

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:28.792
during the plague centuries,
when death was unleashed in

00:20:28.792 --> 00:20:30.630
Europe repeatedly.
 

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:33.490
Vanitas,
as a theme, flowered in the

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.079
sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.

00:20:36.079 --> 00:20:37.410
Now what did it mean?
 

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:42.162
Well, vanitas paintings
were meant to display the

00:20:42.162 --> 00:20:46.309
temporal goods of this world:
flowers perhaps;

00:20:46.309 --> 00:20:50.277
fruits;
symbols of learning and culture

00:20:50.277 --> 00:20:53.450
such as musical instruments or
books;

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:58.532
or signs of earthly achievement
and wealth, like gold and

00:20:58.532 --> 00:20:59.348
jewels.
 

00:20:59.348 --> 00:21:03.371
But they're juxtaposed to
striking and more shocking

00:21:03.371 --> 00:21:07.708
symbols of what's meant to be
the deeper reality of this

00:21:07.708 --> 00:21:11.607
transitory,
fragile life that we live,

00:21:11.607 --> 00:21:14.450
and the imminence of death.
 

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:18.766
And, so, alongside these
earthly things,

00:21:18.766 --> 00:21:23.960
you'll see a skull;
a candle whose flame has just

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.660
gone out;
an hourglass marking the

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:31.500
passage of time;
the crossbones.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.282
And the message is--that also
is a biblical one--vanity from

00:21:36.282 --> 00:21:37.500
Ecclesiastes.
 

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.808
Let me just read you a sentence.
 

00:21:39.808 --> 00:21:44.880
"What profit hath a man of
his labor under the sun?

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:51.150
One generation passeth away and
another generation cometh."

00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:56.973
In an age of sudden mass death,
human achievement was futile

00:21:56.973 --> 00:22:00.794
and impermanent,
and you should instead be

00:22:00.794 --> 00:22:05.226
preparing yourselves for the
true reality of death and the

00:22:05.226 --> 00:22:06.858
ever-lasting life.
 

00:22:06.858 --> 00:22:11.761
Now, this we can see directly
linked to what you're reading

00:22:11.761 --> 00:22:13.200
about in Defoe.
 

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.400
Here we have the London Bills
of Mortality,

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.070
in 1664 to 1665;
years that you know and are

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.180
coming to love.
 

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.430
And this is the illustration
that introduced the bills.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:29.988
It helps us to make the direct
connection between plague and

00:22:29.988 --> 00:22:33.618
the iconography I've just been
talking about.

00:22:33.618 --> 00:22:37.299
You'll notice that the symbols
are the classic vanitas

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:39.568
symbols of the seventeenth
century.

00:22:39.568 --> 00:22:42.545
You see the skeleton,
the crossbones,

00:22:42.545 --> 00:22:47.339
the shovel and all the rest of
it, all around the edges.

00:22:47.339 --> 00:22:49.539
The skull, the hourglass here.
 

00:22:49.539 --> 00:22:51.160
The time is running out.
 

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.317
And indeed you'll see right
here that this is--the

00:22:54.317 --> 00:22:56.828
inscription is a memento
mori.

00:22:56.828 --> 00:23:01.122
This is to remind you that
death is coming and could strike

00:23:01.122 --> 00:23:04.230
at any moment,
and you had best prepare.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:08.818
Let's look at another painting
of these centuries.

00:23:08.818 --> 00:23:13.230
This is Lucas Furtenagel--well,
this actually isn't,

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:14.269
I'm sorry.
 

00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:16.480
This is a different one.
 

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.250
But let me move--you can see in
this painting again the candle

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.190
going out.
 

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:25.599
You can see the skull and human
achievements.

00:23:25.599 --> 00:23:29.630
All are vanity, is the lesson.
 

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:32.368
Or this, rather--this is the
one I was mentioning;

00:23:32.368 --> 00:23:36.742
Lucas Rutenagel,
in the sixteenth century in

00:23:36.742 --> 00:23:37.759
Germany.
 

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:41.450
This is "Hans Burgkmair
and His Wife,"

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.098
a painting of 1527.
 

00:23:43.098 --> 00:23:46.583
And the point is that looking
in the mirror,

00:23:46.583 --> 00:23:50.957
they see the true reality of
themselves, which is their

00:23:50.957 --> 00:23:52.818
skulls after death.
 

00:23:52.818 --> 00:23:56.959
And, so, this is reminding us
that this is the true reality

00:23:56.959 --> 00:23:59.098
that lies beneath all of us.
 

00:23:59.098 --> 00:24:02.048
Or let's look at another
painting.

00:24:02.048 --> 00:24:05.817
This is Harmen Steenwyck,
a painting called

00:24:05.817 --> 00:24:08.598
"Vanitas,"
of 1640.

00:24:08.598 --> 00:24:11.317
I'm trying to show you
paintings from different

00:24:11.317 --> 00:24:14.269
countries, from England,
France, the Low Countries,

00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:15.569
Germany and so on.
 

00:24:15.569 --> 00:24:18.088
This is the Low Countries.
 

00:24:18.088 --> 00:24:20.756
And this painting,
housed in Leiden,

00:24:20.756 --> 00:24:25.097
and is quite clearly about
exactly what we've been talking

00:24:25.097 --> 00:24:28.055
about;
the candle, the skull,

00:24:28.055 --> 00:24:31.150
the books that are evanescent.
 

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.548
Or more subtly but quite
famously,

00:24:33.548 --> 00:24:37.372
this is Hans Holbein the
Younger's painting called

00:24:37.372 --> 00:24:41.740
"The Ambassadors,"
which now hangs in London in

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.690
the National Gallery.
 

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:49.298
It's an ironic commentary on
the court of Henry VIII.

00:24:49.298 --> 00:24:53.859
All about the painting you see
the display of symbols of

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:57.508
wealth, power and learning:
elegant costumes,

00:24:57.508 --> 00:25:01.240
the globe, the book,
musical instruments.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:07.030
But in somber juxtaposition to
them all is the apparent smudge

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:10.450
in the foreground of the
painting.

00:25:10.450 --> 00:25:14.214
But if you look at it closely,
what it actually is,

00:25:14.214 --> 00:25:17.377
is a large and perfectly
constructed skull,

00:25:17.377 --> 00:25:20.240
seen from a different
perspective;

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:25.079
a technique known as an
anamorphosis.

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:28.980
Let's look at one more vanitas.
 

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:33.654
This is Renard de Saint-Andre's
seventeenth-century painting

00:25:33.654 --> 00:25:37.220
called, appropriately,
"Vanitas".

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:39.618
I think you get the picture.
 

00:25:39.618 --> 00:25:45.449
Another theme of these
centuries, of death unleashed,

00:25:45.449 --> 00:25:50.381
is the theme called the
danse macabre,

00:25:50.381 --> 00:25:52.960
the dance of death.
 

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.586
Now, let me stress that once
again this is not a school of

00:25:57.586 --> 00:25:58.480
painting.
 

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.279
This is part of the iconography.
 

00:26:01.279 --> 00:26:06.548
It's the theme in the painting.
 

00:26:06.548 --> 00:26:10.296
It appears as a common motif in
European Art,

00:26:10.296 --> 00:26:14.640
from the mid-fourteenth century
to the sixteenth;

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.472
in paintings,
in prints and very importantly

00:26:18.472 --> 00:26:19.900
on tombstones.
 

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:22.410
It began with the Black Death.
 

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:27.279
And with the eighteenth century
and the vanishing of the plague,

00:26:27.279 --> 00:26:31.608
it becomes rarer and rarer,
it more or less fades out.

00:26:31.608 --> 00:26:36.968
The danse macabre
portrays death as a skeleton,

00:26:36.968 --> 00:26:42.832
inviting people of all ages,
ranks and sexes to join in the

00:26:42.832 --> 00:26:45.358
merry dance of death.
 

00:26:45.358 --> 00:26:50.258
And death is usually armed with
a scythe, or an arrow,

00:26:50.258 --> 00:26:54.880
or a dart, and often plays a
musical instrument.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:58.467
In the words of The Catholic
Encyclopedia:

00:26:58.467 --> 00:27:02.875
"The Black Death brought
before popular imagination the

00:27:02.875 --> 00:27:06.240
subject of death and its
universal sway,

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:08.769
as never before.
 

00:27:08.769 --> 00:27:12.711
At this time,
death appeared as the messenger

00:27:12.711 --> 00:27:17.548
of God, summoning men to the
world beyond the grave.

00:27:17.548 --> 00:27:21.662
During those years,
many churches enacted literal

00:27:21.662 --> 00:27:25.838
dances of death,
or transformed it into a play

00:27:25.838 --> 00:27:30.233
conveying the idea of the
fragility of life and the

00:27:30.233 --> 00:27:35.069
nearness of death and the need
for repentance."

00:27:35.069 --> 00:27:36.618
There are other examples.
 

00:27:36.618 --> 00:27:41.135
I'd like to show you five
slides from St.

00:27:41.135 --> 00:27:45.538
Mary's Church of L�beck in
Germany.

00:27:45.538 --> 00:27:50.449
A glorious mural from 1463,
one of the glories of the

00:27:50.449 --> 00:27:52.808
Renaissance in Germany.
 

00:27:52.808 --> 00:27:56.768
But unfortunately it was
destroyed by Allied bombing in

00:27:56.768 --> 00:28:01.019
the war, and so there's only a
black and white reproduction

00:28:01.019 --> 00:28:02.778
that I can show you.
 

00:28:02.778 --> 00:28:05.657
But the theme comes across
quite clearly,

00:28:05.657 --> 00:28:09.400
and is a good example of the
danse macabre.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:13.828
What it is, is a portrayal,
in separate paintings,

00:28:13.828 --> 00:28:18.710
of a whole society suddenly
summoned by Angel of Death,

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:20.788
the bubonic plague.
 

00:28:20.788 --> 00:28:24.401
The first one is the pope and
the emperor being summoned by

00:28:24.401 --> 00:28:24.900
death.
 

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:30.650
It doesn't matter who you are,
everyone falls victim in time

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:31.818
of plague.
 

00:28:31.818 --> 00:28:36.599
Well, here we see another level
of society, a canon and a

00:28:36.599 --> 00:28:39.930
nobleman being called again by
death.

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:45.569
Or the third is the parish
priest and the artisan,

00:28:45.569 --> 00:28:51.326
who are also being asked to
take part in the dance,

00:28:51.326 --> 00:28:55.470
and then the priest and
peasant.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:58.797
The whole of society,
in other words,

00:28:58.797 --> 00:29:01.940
is being stricken by mass
death.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.750
And here we have youth,
a maiden and a baby.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:10.828
So, we have a portrayal,
in a sense, of universal death.

00:29:10.828 --> 00:29:15.278
This was important in the time
of bubonic plague.

00:29:15.278 --> 00:29:18.888
There was another major
development of the plague

00:29:18.888 --> 00:29:23.026
centuries, and this was the
emergence of cults of famous

00:29:23.026 --> 00:29:24.380
plague saints.
 

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:31.880
Saint Sebastian,
San Rocco and Saint George.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.734
And let's look then at four
pictures of Saint Sebastian,

00:29:35.734 --> 00:29:39.308
from four of the great artists
of the Plague Era.

00:29:39.308 --> 00:29:43.048
You remember why Saint
Sebastian was so important?

00:29:43.048 --> 00:29:46.694
Because the arrows were symbols
of the plague,

00:29:46.694 --> 00:29:51.394
and Saint Sebastian is offering
his body to defend humanity

00:29:51.394 --> 00:29:54.150
against the wrath of the Lord.
 

00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:59.769
And Saint Sebastian is a theme
who becomes very important in

00:29:59.769 --> 00:30:04.151
these centuries,
for the first time in European

00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:05.390
painting.
 

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:12.034
This is Sandro Botticelli's
painting of Saint Sebastian of

00:30:12.034 --> 00:30:12.848
1484.
 

00:30:12.848 --> 00:30:16.400
Or let me show you another
major painter,

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:19.950
Raphael's "Saint
Sebastian."

00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:25.940
Or let me show you Guido Reni's
picture of him.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:31.224
Or finally, from the Low
Countries, Hendrick ter

00:30:31.224 --> 00:30:35.161
Brugghen's
early-seventeenth-century

00:30:35.161 --> 00:30:39.210
painting, 1635,
Saint Sebastian.

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:42.520
It was also,
as I said, --the time of the

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.247
cult of another saint--and this
is Saint Roch,

00:30:46.247 --> 00:30:48.980
or we can call him San Rocco.
 

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.808
You know his life already.
 

00:30:50.808 --> 00:30:55.969
He was from Montpellier in
France, and devoted himself

00:30:55.969 --> 00:31:01.615
during his travels to tending
the plaque-stricken in Italy,

00:31:01.615 --> 00:31:04.730
and protecting the faithful.
 

00:31:04.730 --> 00:31:09.212
After his death,
then, his intercession was

00:31:09.212 --> 00:31:14.124
invoked across Europe,
and his cult spread from

00:31:14.124 --> 00:31:16.578
country to country.
 

00:31:16.578 --> 00:31:22.528
Often we see Sebastian and
Rocco painted together.

00:31:22.528 --> 00:31:26.355
This is Andrea da Murano,
"Christ Embracing the

00:31:26.355 --> 00:31:29.430
Saints,"
Sebastian here to his right,

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:31.680
and San Rocco to his left.
 

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:37.038
And you can almost always tell
that San Rocco has the bubo in

00:31:37.038 --> 00:31:38.108
his thigh.
 

00:31:38.108 --> 00:31:43.828
It's clearly the bubonic plague
that's being referred to here.

00:31:43.828 --> 00:31:53.567
Or Francesco Vecellio--this is
the Madonna, between Sebastian

00:31:53.567 --> 00:31:57.950
here and San Rocco there.
 

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.244
In addition,
it was larger scale than just

00:32:01.244 --> 00:32:02.210
paintings.
 

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:06.060
It also affected architecture
across Europe,

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.538
and churches were built to San
Rocco across Europe,

00:32:10.538 --> 00:32:14.660
in France, in Austria,
in Vienna, in Rome.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.704
But I think if we're going to
talk about plague and its impact

00:32:18.704 --> 00:32:21.690
on the built environment and
architecture,

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:26.147
as well as painting,
I think the best place we could

00:32:26.147 --> 00:32:27.460
go is Venice.
 

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:31.220
Venice, as you know,
because of its site in the

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:34.586
Mediterranean,
at the center of the trade

00:32:34.586 --> 00:32:38.920
routes, was scourged again and
again by bubonic plague,

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.521
and was the place that first
devised the anti-plague

00:32:42.521 --> 00:32:43.298
measures.
 

00:32:43.298 --> 00:32:48.755
So, Venice has a deep
association with bubonic plague,

00:32:48.755 --> 00:32:53.798
and it left its imprint in
stone and on canvas.

00:32:53.798 --> 00:32:58.028
I'd like to look at some of--if
you were to visit Venice,

00:32:58.028 --> 00:33:02.028
you would see that its whole
urban landscape is deeply

00:33:02.028 --> 00:33:04.368
affected by bubonic plague.
 

00:33:04.368 --> 00:33:09.038
Also, even the gondolas are,
in fact, a reference--that's

00:33:09.038 --> 00:33:12.288
why they're black--to bubonic
plague;

00:33:12.288 --> 00:33:16.130
from conveying the bodies at
the time.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:22.236
This is the church of Saint
Mary of Health,

00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:25.288
built in the 1530s.
 

00:33:25.288 --> 00:33:30.348
And what it's doing is after
the plague had passed,

00:33:30.348 --> 00:33:34.596
this is a church that's built
to commemorate the passage of

00:33:34.596 --> 00:33:37.567
plague,
and to thank God for allowing

00:33:37.567 --> 00:33:41.538
his wrath to be assuaged,
and for health to be returned.

00:33:41.538 --> 00:33:46.577
And, so, that's why we have one
of the most important churches

00:33:46.577 --> 00:33:49.548
in Venice is Saint Mary of
Health.

00:33:49.548 --> 00:33:54.890
And these are a couple of
closer pictures of it.

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:59.048
And that's moving into the
interior.

00:33:59.048 --> 00:34:02.980
Let me also show you another
church.

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:05.650
This is the Church of the
Redeemer,

00:34:05.650 --> 00:34:12.940
and it's a church also built at
time of plague to thank God for

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:19.760
the assuaging of his wrath and
the survival of the city.

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:21.769
A closer picture.
 

00:34:21.769 --> 00:34:24.840
And we'll move on.
 

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:32.809
This is again one of the
glories of Venetian art.

00:34:32.809 --> 00:34:36.422
It's called the Scuola Grande
di San

00:34:36.422 --> 00:34:41.516
Rocco,
which is the Great School of

00:34:41.516 --> 00:34:43.000
Saint Rocco.
 

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.719
Let's remember what the school
meant.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:50.342
There were three-hundred or so
so-called "schools"

00:34:50.342 --> 00:34:53.719
at Venice in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries.

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:56.686
What they were is
confraternities,

00:34:56.686 --> 00:35:01.541
associations of laymen,
including the leading trades of

00:35:01.541 --> 00:35:02.710
the city.
 

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:06.097
Some of them had large and
wealthy memberships,

00:35:06.097 --> 00:35:10.001
and played a major role in the
government of the city,

00:35:10.001 --> 00:35:12.360
and amassed enormous wealth.
 

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.400
The functions of the
confraternities were originally

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.429
devotional.
 

00:35:17.429 --> 00:35:20.849
And given the exposure of
Venice to the plague,

00:35:20.849 --> 00:35:25.483
it's not surprising that the
very largest and most powerful

00:35:25.483 --> 00:35:29.880
of the schools chose Saint Rocco
as its patron saint.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.199
And this is--it bears the name.
 

00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:36.130
It constructed a magnificent
building,

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:40.000
and commissioned the greatest
Venetian artist of the century,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.014
Jacopo Tintoretto,
to decorate it,

00:35:43.014 --> 00:35:48.313
in veneration of Saint Rocco,
and in direct rivalry to the

00:35:48.313 --> 00:35:50.349
Sistine Chapel in Rome.
 

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:54.329
So, let's move inside.
 

00:35:54.329 --> 00:35:56.079
There we are.
 

00:35:56.079 --> 00:36:00.523
And we'll see that we're
looking at--in these plague

00:36:00.523 --> 00:36:05.230
scenes, we'll be seeing that
we're going to look at the

00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:07.670
magnificence of the art.
 

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.929
And this is the interior of it.
 

00:36:09.929 --> 00:36:14.498
I just wanted to show you that
at the height of the painting is

00:36:14.498 --> 00:36:18.329
Tintoretto's painting of the
Triumph of San Rocco;

00:36:18.329 --> 00:36:23.677
San Rocco, the great plague
saint, achieving his reward in

00:36:23.677 --> 00:36:26.400
heaven and going up to God.
 

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.570
Plague also affected across
Europe.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:34.751
Let me also say another theme
in the urban landscape involved

00:36:34.751 --> 00:36:36.219
plague columns.
 

00:36:36.219 --> 00:36:39.239
And you can see these,
particularly in Central and

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:43.291
Eastern Europe,
a great plague column in the

00:36:43.291 --> 00:36:49.481
center of Vienna,
or also in Pilsen in the Czech

00:36:49.481 --> 00:36:50.880
Republic.
 

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:56.809
Or in--here's yet another in
Hungary.

00:36:56.809 --> 00:36:58.940
Now, in these plague scenes,
of course,

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:02.692
remember that by definition
we're looking at works by

00:37:02.692 --> 00:37:06.202
survivors,
whose sense of horror was

00:37:06.202 --> 00:37:10.010
tempered perhaps by a bit of
relief.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.610
If it were possible to have
works by the victims,

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:17.360
perhaps the scenes would be
even more wrenching.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:20.869
There are also aspects that
aren't mentioned in the

00:37:20.869 --> 00:37:24.659
literature and are unknowable,
but perhaps probable.

00:37:24.659 --> 00:37:28.731
What happened to those who
suffered from the plague and

00:37:28.731 --> 00:37:30.389
then were recovered?
 

00:37:30.389 --> 00:37:32.820
Was their fertility affected?
 

00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:37.690
Were there long-term sequelae
and neurological deficits?

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:42.329
Were there psychological
effects that we would now term

00:37:42.329 --> 00:37:45.079
posttraumatic stress syndrome?
 

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:49.840
But in our discussion of
plague, I also want to say that

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:53.822
there were a couple of
speculative, large-scale

00:37:53.822 --> 00:37:57.199
conclusions that I want to hint
at.

00:37:57.199 --> 00:38:00.489
The presence of plague over
four centuries,

00:38:00.489 --> 00:38:05.130
as we've just seen,
had a major impact on religion,

00:38:05.130 --> 00:38:11.500
on culture, on societal
attitudes toward life and death,

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:15.050
and left a major imprint on
architecture,

00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:18.960
on painting and sculpture.
 

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.215
In addition,
I want to speculate for a

00:38:22.215 --> 00:38:27.054
moment and say that we might
also think that perhaps the

00:38:27.054 --> 00:38:30.764
plague--
and especially not the plague

00:38:30.764 --> 00:38:33.827
itself,
but the triumph over it,

00:38:33.827 --> 00:38:37.369
by the means we described last
time--

00:38:37.369 --> 00:38:42.496
may have been a factor that
helped to transform European

00:38:42.496 --> 00:38:44.639
intellectual history.
 

00:38:44.639 --> 00:38:49.782
Now, it's one of the great
clich�s that the eighteenth

00:38:49.782 --> 00:38:52.867
century, the Age of
Enlightenment,

00:38:52.867 --> 00:38:58.010
was a great age of optimism and
belief in progress.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:04.335
But I'd argue that perhaps the
belief in progress required some

00:39:04.335 --> 00:39:10.454
tangible material foundation,
and that this was grounded in a

00:39:10.454 --> 00:39:15.443
new sense that life,
in fact, was becoming more

00:39:15.443 --> 00:39:22.739
secure, and that perhaps mankind
could master its environment and

00:39:22.739 --> 00:39:24.449
its destiny.
 

00:39:24.449 --> 00:39:28.989
And, so, I would argue that
it's very significant that the

00:39:28.989 --> 00:39:33.500
first great medical conquest--
at least public health

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.668
conquest--resulted from the
application of the power of the

00:39:38.668 --> 00:39:42.065
state,
of administrative measures in

00:39:42.065 --> 00:39:44.139
the plague regulations.
 

00:39:44.139 --> 00:39:47.860
And it's no coincidence then
that the eighteenth century--

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:51.927
and during this time,
the State came to be seen as a

00:39:51.927 --> 00:39:56.748
source of redeeming power,
that could transform human

00:39:56.748 --> 00:39:58.389
lifeand society.
 

00:39:58.389 --> 00:40:03.250
Here was an impetus towards
reform, and a re-thinking

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:04.840
intellectually.
 

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.309
Medical history,
in a sense, one could argue,

00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:12.931
was one factor that helped to
sound the death knell of the old

00:40:12.931 --> 00:40:16.065
regime,
dramatically and successfully

00:40:16.065 --> 00:40:21.733
demonstrating humans' capacity--
that is, man's capacity to make

00:40:21.733 --> 00:40:24.030
his or her own history.
 

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:27.487
Here was a basis for a new
faith in reason,

00:40:27.487 --> 00:40:31.440
and the creative potential of
political power.

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.291
Perhaps it's suggestive to
remember that Jean-Jacques

00:40:35.291 --> 00:40:38.336
Rousseau,
the founder of modern

00:40:38.336 --> 00:40:43.342
revolutionary political thought,
began his--and one of the

00:40:43.342 --> 00:40:47.608
heroes of the Enlightenment--
began his career in Venice,

00:40:47.608 --> 00:40:51.960
which for a time he regarded as
a model regime.

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:56.771
And that his time there
included a month of reflection,

00:40:56.771 --> 00:41:01.851
as he underwent a term of
quarantine in the great Venetian

00:41:01.851 --> 00:41:03.099
lazaretto.
 

00:41:03.099 --> 00:41:08.251
But again, I want to avoid
giving any suggestion that I

00:41:08.251 --> 00:41:12.449
want to propound a germ theory
of history.

00:41:12.449 --> 00:41:15.186
As a historian,
I'm opposed,

00:41:15.186 --> 00:41:19.445
by training,
to mono-causal explanations of

00:41:19.445 --> 00:41:21.170
major events.
 

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:24.791
And, so, what I'm not saying is
that the conquest of the plague

00:41:24.791 --> 00:41:27.760
caused the Enlightenment;
I'm not saying that.

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:33.239
I merely want to note that the
conquest over the plague first--

00:41:33.239 --> 00:41:38.030
and we'll be talking next week
about smallpox second--

00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:42.632
were extraordinary influences,
triumphs over the two most

00:41:42.632 --> 00:41:46.577
feared diseases of the
seventeenth and eighteenth

00:41:46.577 --> 00:41:50.184
centuries,
the first conquest over

00:41:50.184 --> 00:41:52.250
infectious disease.
 

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:57.123
And I would say that that
wasn't a million miles away from

00:41:57.123 --> 00:42:02.170
being a background influence on
the coming of the Age of the

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:03.710
Enlightenment.
 

00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:09.715
I would also speculate that the
triumph over plague first,

00:42:09.715 --> 00:42:14.244
and then smallpox,
also played a role in the

00:42:14.244 --> 00:42:18.460
coming of the industrial
revolution;

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:24.353
that the plague and smallpox
had been enormous brakes on

00:42:24.353 --> 00:42:29.820
demographic growth and the
growth of the economy.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.340
And the conquest of the plague
by the eighteenth century,

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:39.293
followed by victory over
smallpox, had a major impact on

00:42:39.293 --> 00:42:45.139
launching a great age of
European population growth.

00:42:45.139 --> 00:42:49.045
And population growth,
in turn, was a precondition for

00:42:49.045 --> 00:42:52.139
the coming of the Industrial
Revolution.

00:42:52.139 --> 00:42:56.003
Again, note that I'm not saying
that the conquest of plague was

00:42:56.003 --> 00:42:59.554
a mono-causal explanation for
the coming of the Industrial

00:42:59.554 --> 00:43:00.489
Revolution.
 

00:43:00.489 --> 00:43:05.639
I'm saying simply that it was
one of many pre-conditions;

00:43:05.639 --> 00:43:10.369
that it was a growing
population that provided that

00:43:10.369 --> 00:43:14.625
endless supply of free laborers
for factories,

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:16.989
mines and sweatshops.
 

00:43:16.989 --> 00:43:22.170
And it also provided a growing
market for industrial products.

00:43:22.170 --> 00:43:28.452
Demographic change then
supplied a large home market for

00:43:28.452 --> 00:43:29.710
industry.
 

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.306
Having made that argument with
regard to plague,

00:43:33.306 --> 00:43:37.822
next week what I'd like to do
is to turn to the second major

00:43:37.822 --> 00:43:39.429
epidemic disease.
 

00:43:39.429 --> 00:43:43.679
If plague was the greatest
feared disease of the

00:43:43.679 --> 00:43:47.695
seventeenth century,
and from the fourteenth through

00:43:47.695 --> 00:43:51.250
the seventeenth,
in the eighteenth century the

00:43:51.250 --> 00:43:54.099
most feared disease was
smallpox.

00:43:54.099 --> 00:43:56.940
And I'd like to look next at
smallpox,

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:01.739
its impact, and on the second
great development of a public

00:44:01.739 --> 00:44:04.791
health measure,
a very different one,

00:44:04.791 --> 00:44:08.659
which was the public health
measure of vaccination.

00:44:08.659 --> 00:44:11.059
So, that's where we're going
next.

00:44:11.059 --> 00:44:16.000

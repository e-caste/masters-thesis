00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.990
Prof: You're going to
get more numbers today.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.790
I know you--how many love
numbers?

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.920
You can't live without numbers.
 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:17.325
What did I tell you was the
traditional, before modern

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:20.120
times, death rate?
 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.828
A number you should keep,
or birth rate,

00:00:22.828 --> 00:00:25.120
it's the same--about per 1,000?
 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:35.461
About 40 to 50 per 1,000 is the
birth and death rate at a life

00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:42.337
expectancy of 20 years,
that means 1/20th of the people

00:00:42.337 --> 00:00:47.271
die every year and so you need
50 out of 1,000 births 1/20th of

00:00:47.271 --> 00:00:50.912
your people to be births;
so births and deaths,

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:53.200
in what we call primitive
times,

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.220
which might mean up to the
Napoleonic Revolution,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.780
almost is 40 to 50 births and
40 to 50 deaths a year.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.120
Now here is modern times.
 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.305
We're starting in 1950 in all
of these graphs and coming in

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:15.870
the period of the popular--
main--beginning births of the

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.470
population explosion 1950 to
1990 in all these cases.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.165
And here are the various parts
of the world and you'll notice

00:01:25.165 --> 00:01:32.456
that this is the death--
I'm sorry the birth rate is 50,

00:01:32.456 --> 00:01:39.920
birth rate is 43 or something
42,43, 45,45.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.400
That 1950 the birth rate is at
approximately its level for

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.790
centuries way back.
 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.174
We know that not too much
before this time since

00:01:53.174 --> 00:01:57.000
population was not growing until
some--

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.927
a little bit before this time
that the death rate must have

00:02:00.927 --> 00:02:04.872
been the same,
so the death rate was also 40

00:02:04.872 --> 00:02:06.219
to 50 people.
 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.299
Look what happened.
 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:12.536
By 1950 the death rate is
already down to half of its

00:02:12.536 --> 00:02:17.471
traditional level,
even in Sub-Saharan Africa it's

00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:21.322
almost reduced to half;
in Central America,

00:02:21.322 --> 00:02:23.169
the Caribbean,
less than half;

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.759
South America less than half;
China about half;

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:31.229
South Asia about half;
Southeast Asia about half.

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:35.930
In most of the world by the
1950s the birthrate was still

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.455
extremely high,
but the death rate had come

00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:43.150
down to half of what it had
always been.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.627
What was going on is that these
countries were almost all still

00:02:47.627 --> 00:02:51.889
under colonial rule with the
exception of South America,

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:55.250
which might be a reason why
it's even better.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.141
And, among all their faults,
the colonialists did institute

00:03:00.141 --> 00:03:03.276
basic sanitation,
basic public health,

00:03:03.276 --> 00:03:07.256
basic public order and they
stopped a lot of the warfare

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:08.919
between communities.
 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:12.633
They imposed a lot of violence
upon the people but that was

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:16.476
apparently much less then the
violence that local communities

00:03:16.476 --> 00:03:19.870
imposed upon each other in the
pre-colonial era,

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.750
so the death rate was down by
the 1950s.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.156
Sometime in 50s,
around 1950,

00:03:28.156 --> 00:03:33.400
the birth rate started coming
down in all those countries,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.756
and even though the birthrate
starts at these very,

00:03:36.756 --> 00:03:40.985
very high levels they come down
almost everywhere with of course

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:43.940
the exception being Sub-Saharan
Africa,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.807
and you've read about why that
is and I keep saying that almost

00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:50.354
everything we say,
SubSaharan Africa is an

00:03:50.354 --> 00:03:52.930
exception to the rate.
 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.419
Even though the death rate was
down,

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:00.206
the birth rate didn't change
much, but in every other part of

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:02.020
the developing regions of the
world,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.453
the birth rate and the death
rate came down approximately in

00:04:07.453 --> 00:04:09.938
parallel with each other.
 

00:04:09.938 --> 00:04:15.163
Of course the difference
between that birth and death

00:04:15.163 --> 00:04:20.988
rate is population increase -
and this is the heyday of the

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:23.500
population explosion.
 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.170
Remember this is per 1,000 so
it's a percent kind of a number,

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.954
so as the population grows the
number of people represented by

00:04:31.954 --> 00:04:34.190
this percent cap grows and
grows,

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:40.148
and grows, and so this explains
the graph I showed you last

00:04:40.148 --> 00:04:46.519
time,
or two times ago.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:51.946
Starting again in 1950 to 1990,
the number of people added each

00:04:51.946 --> 00:04:55.899
year just keeps growing,
with one blip and you'll see

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:59.550
later in the course,
I've shown you that blip

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.050
before, but we'll discuss what
that blip is.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.843
The data for the individual
regions of the world and this

00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:10.079
all fits together,
makes sense.

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:14.800
Now we've been through the
European population story,

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.040
and again we saw that,
not always but mostly,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.649
the death rate fell first and
then the birth rate fell and

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:23.500
Europe went through a population
explosion.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.160
To say this story the way I've
been telling you,

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.096
no differences,
that the third world is just

00:05:29.096 --> 00:05:32.509
going through exactly what
Europe went through,

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.610
but it isn't true.
 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.560
Let's compare two of the
fertility transitions.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.137
This is Sweden and this is
Mexico, and you'll notice that

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:52.113
Sweden has birth and death kind
of hanging around until maybe

00:05:52.113 --> 00:05:54.177
here,
until 1860s,

00:05:54.177 --> 00:05:59.161
and that's just what the
Princeton Project found out that

00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:04.233
the really serious decline
happened somewhere in this 1870

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:08.697
region,
and then the death rate

00:06:08.697 --> 00:06:16.029
declines rather continuously on
through the time,

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:17.860
and the birth rate declines.
 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.360
This starts around 1870.
 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.819
Mexico's decrease starts around
1970.

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:27.495
So between what we now call the
developing countries or the

00:06:27.495 --> 00:06:30.940
third world countries,
about 100 year difference

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.961
between when Europe started its
transition and when the

00:06:34.961 --> 00:06:38.610
developing countries started
their transition.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:40.660
Now 100 years may seem a lot to
you,

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.680
but in the course of human
history,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.060
since these numbers had been
going on forever,

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.129
100 years is a very,
very short time.

00:06:50.129 --> 00:07:08.452
Another difference you should
note is--Hang on,

00:07:08.452 --> 00:07:16.420
I just fixed this.
 

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:29.209
Usually that's all that
required I hope.

00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:40.459
Nope.
 

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:52.279
Anybody have a laser pointer by
any miracle?

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:56.254
All right, we're going to have
a little bit of trouble today

00:07:56.254 --> 00:07:58.949
but I think you can figure
things out.

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:05.978
Notice that the levels of
everything there are lower in

00:08:05.978 --> 00:08:08.880
Sweden,
that Sweden starts and the

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.577
European countries generally
start at a lower level of births

00:08:12.577 --> 00:08:15.766
and a lower level of deaths,
so they were already,

00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:18.720
by the time that their serious
transition starts,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:23.278
they're already quite a ways
down compared to where Mexico

00:08:23.278 --> 00:08:24.000
starts.
 

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:37.631
Notice that the deaths and the
births are much higher in Mexico

00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:41.370
than in Europe.
 

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:46.773
Now those are important,
but notice the gradualness of

00:08:46.773 --> 00:08:48.710
the decline here.
 

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:53.029
That Sweden had a long time to
adjust to these changes,

00:08:53.029 --> 00:08:57.509
whereas, look at the drop in
the death rate in Mexico.

00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:58.990
Boom!
 

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.731
Basically all of a sudden and
then give it a generation,

00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:05.250
look at the drop in the birth
rate.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:10.488
That's the most amazing thing,
how rapidly things change in

00:09:10.488 --> 00:09:15.095
the developing world,
compared to the way it changed

00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:16.360
in Europe.
 

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:22.778
Because of this rapidity of
this decline and a natural delay

00:09:22.778 --> 00:09:25.625
here,
whereas in Sweden that might be

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:27.815
the delay,
the delay means because of the

00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:31.586
rapidity of the decline,
that the difference now between

00:09:31.586 --> 00:09:36.086
births and deaths is this huge
amount compared to a much

00:09:36.086 --> 00:09:37.970
smaller amount here.
 

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:40.899
Europe never had to cope with
the rate of increase,

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:43.360
the number of people added
every year,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.457
the percentage of the
population, never had to cope

00:09:47.457 --> 00:09:52.129
with anything like what the
currently developing countries

00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:55.899
had and that's a result of the
rapid drop.

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:59.720
The other thing to note,
of course,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.586
is that by this time,
the births and the deaths in

00:10:02.586 --> 00:10:06.407
Sweden are essentially equal,
and Sweden's population is not

00:10:06.407 --> 00:10:10.171
growing anymore and that as you
heard from Dr. Teitelbaum's

00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:13.486
lecture,
is characteristic of Europe as

00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:16.375
a whole,
as well as Japan,

00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:21.158
and a lot of the East Asian
countries.

00:10:21.158 --> 00:10:26.624
A cartoon of this which has--a
lot right about and one big

00:10:26.624 --> 00:10:30.179
thing wrong with it,
is that here's the rich

00:10:30.179 --> 00:10:33.817
countries, they start--
this is the pop--rate of

00:10:33.817 --> 00:10:38.946
increase of population growth,
that they start earlier,

00:10:38.946 --> 00:10:42.269
he starts it quite early in
France,

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:46.582
and 100 years later--in this
graph it's called 'poor

00:10:46.582 --> 00:10:48.190
countries' start.
 

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.918
The peak, the rise is slow,
the fall is slow,

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:54.798
the rise is fast,
the fall is fast,

00:10:54.798 --> 00:10:57.509
the peak is much lower here.
 

00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:59.389
The peak is about 1%.
 

00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:04.567
The maximum rate of growth that
Europe ever experienced was 1%,

00:11:04.567 --> 00:11:09.326
whereas, for poor countries,
the average was 2.5% and some

00:11:09.326 --> 00:11:10.830
were up at 3%.
 

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:18.792
So, enormously greater stress
on the countries that went

00:11:18.792 --> 00:11:23.279
through this very,
very fast.

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:26.360
Why did this happen?
 

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.288
Why is it so much faster in
developing countries?

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:31.710
We say that as each country,
as it gets into their

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.340
transition phase later,
everything happens faster.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:38.210
It's quite a robust phenomenon.
 

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.392
Every few years,
you say, oh man China or some

00:11:41.392 --> 00:11:43.317
country,
Korea, Taiwan,

00:11:43.317 --> 00:11:48.153
had the fastest decline ever
and then a few years later some

00:11:48.153 --> 00:11:52.990
new countries enter in and their
decline is even faster.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:57.225
One of the main reasons is that
contraceptives were invented

00:11:57.225 --> 00:11:58.230
around here.
 

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:02.048
The pill, the diaphragm,
kind of all that--

00:12:02.048 --> 00:12:05.960
well some of them went way back
here but the modern method,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.105
the really modern methods were
all like the pill in around the

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:10.649
1960s.
 

00:12:10.649 --> 00:12:15.235
This is a graph showing that
the developing countries are

00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:18.644
using contraception,
so here is contraceptive

00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:20.777
prevalence,
the percent of women and

00:12:20.777 --> 00:12:23.120
childbearing ages that use
contraception,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.450
and it ranges from very little,
less than 10% to like 70%.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.160
The U.S.
 

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.649
is in the 60% to 70% range.
 

00:12:31.649 --> 00:12:34.408
Notice that the fertility,
the total fertility rate,

00:12:34.408 --> 00:12:36.740
if the country's not using
contraception,

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.433
very high fertility rate,
as they use more and more

00:12:40.433 --> 00:12:43.759
contraception their fertility
rate goes on.

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:47.197
The mechanism in the developing
countries is use of

00:12:47.197 --> 00:12:50.500
contraception and mostly modern
contraception.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.227
Whereas, when Europe went
through its transition,

00:12:53.227 --> 00:12:55.730
they didn't have hardly any
contraception.

00:12:55.730 --> 00:13:00.695
Some condoms were just
beginning to come in but none of

00:13:00.695 --> 00:13:05.936
the modern chemical methods or
the better kinds of barrier

00:13:05.936 --> 00:13:07.038
methods.
 

00:13:07.038 --> 00:13:11.440
The story is kind of--that,
why the developing countries

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.519
are faster is that the science
is already there,

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:19.331
the medical stuff is there,
the death rate comes down

00:13:19.331 --> 00:13:23.876
because again Europe developed
the medical know how and then it

00:13:23.876 --> 00:13:27.470
just got transferred very
rapidly: vaccines,

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:31.543
vitamins, viruses,
all of those were discovered

00:13:31.543 --> 00:13:34.200
before the transition there.
 

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.413
Just as important as the
knowledge was an attitude toward

00:13:38.413 --> 00:13:42.024
civil government and civil
society that it is the

00:13:42.024 --> 00:13:46.841
responsibility of governments to
take care of the health of their

00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:47.820
people.
 

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:49.100
That's not a given.
 

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.119
Most countries,
through most of history,

00:13:51.119 --> 00:13:54.019
the government was rapacious
and their idea was to get as

00:13:54.019 --> 00:13:56.350
much taxes from the peasants as
possible.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.998
The peasants were sort of like
non-humans and use those taxes

00:13:59.998 --> 00:14:03.830
to have an army and go try to
get--enlarge their territories.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.850
The idea of civil government,
where the government is for the

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:12.006
people is a fairly modern idea
and one of the basic things that

00:14:12.006 --> 00:14:14.889
governments try to do is public
health.

00:14:14.889 --> 00:14:19.320
Then of course--on the
technology,

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.447
the contraceptives I've
mentioned, the means of mass

00:14:22.447 --> 00:14:25.751
communication,
I'll show you a slide later

00:14:25.751 --> 00:14:30.528
that change in behavior is
triggered a lot by what you see

00:14:30.528 --> 00:14:34.549
on television and what you see
on the radio,

00:14:34.549 --> 00:14:37.240
what you see in newspapers.
 

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:39.570
As in chimpanzees,
we're a very social species,

00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.053
and we're always looking to see
what's acceptable,

00:14:42.053 --> 00:14:44.080
what kind of behavior is
acceptable.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:47.149
Gossip, maybe I mentioned this,
that most of what humans say to

00:14:47.149 --> 00:14:49.971
each other is gossip and the
function of gossip is to find

00:14:49.971 --> 00:14:52.350
what are the limits of
acceptable behavior,

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:56.976
so the mass media is extremely
important in like telling people

00:14:56.976 --> 00:15:01.678
in this case that two children
is the proper way of families.

00:15:01.678 --> 00:15:04.907
They see American television,
American movies,

00:15:04.907 --> 00:15:07.490
or Japanese,
and what do they see?

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.273
Rich people with two children,
whereas as they previously

00:15:10.273 --> 00:15:13.157
believed that in order to be
rich in some sense you have to

00:15:13.157 --> 00:15:18.500
have eight children,
so the media are very important

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.808
in changing perceptions.
 

00:15:21.808 --> 00:15:23.769
Also, for a very long time,
maybe not now,

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:28.408
the West had--cachet--was
considered the future,

00:15:28.408 --> 00:15:31.375
the modernity,
the West was very respected and

00:15:31.375 --> 00:15:34.080
loved around the world and so
the use--

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:39.620
the small family norm was a
characteristic of the Western,

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.840
a lot of people tried to become
like the West,

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.820
there was that cachet.
 

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.307
Of course family planning
programs, the west had a long

00:15:47.307 --> 00:15:49.288
experience with family planning
programs.

00:15:49.288 --> 00:15:51.910
You've read some of the
Margaret Sanger stuff from

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.279
America,
the Marie Stopes stuff from

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:56.647
England,
where people are struggling

00:15:56.647 --> 00:16:00.124
with these things and finally
come out the other end and

00:16:00.124 --> 00:16:02.970
decide to gain control of their
fertility.

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:06.700
In a sense, both medically and
culturally,

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.663
Westerners were the guinea pigs
for this fertility transition

00:16:11.663 --> 00:16:14.629
and then once it was,
in some sense,

00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:17.220
perfected and finished in the
West,

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.918
it was sort of transferred
wholesale to the newly

00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:25.649
developing countries.
 

00:16:25.649 --> 00:16:31.052
Now another thing about the
fertility transition is that not

00:16:31.052 --> 00:16:35.724
only is it more intense
demographically with all the

00:16:35.724 --> 00:16:40.956
statistics that we can gather,
but it's also more intense

00:16:40.956 --> 00:16:41.970
emotionally.
 

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:46.759
As you're for sure well aware
by now in this course,

00:16:46.759 --> 00:16:50.732
there's enormously strong
social norms about sex and

00:16:50.732 --> 00:16:53.972
reproduction,
and if those norms are about to

00:16:53.972 --> 00:16:57.765
change it attacks one of the
most important foundations of a

00:16:57.765 --> 00:17:02.214
culture and there's--
that does not happen without a

00:17:02.214 --> 00:17:05.700
lot of conflict within the
culture.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:09.268
In the West,
although there's a lot of

00:17:09.268 --> 00:17:13.368
discussion about this,
the idea of individualism,

00:17:13.368 --> 00:17:17.400
that people individually go out
and do what's good for them,

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.298
they make choices based on
their own desires.

00:17:20.298 --> 00:17:23.454
There's kind of a long history
of that and it was sort of

00:17:23.454 --> 00:17:26.160
formalized by Adam Smith in
economics saying,

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.444
that if everybody went out and
tried to get as rich as possible

00:17:29.444 --> 00:17:31.460
it would be wonderful for
everybody.

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:34.308
In most of the developing
countries they have a more

00:17:34.308 --> 00:17:38.384
communal kind of attitude,
whereas, often if you speak to

00:17:38.384 --> 00:17:39.913
older,
say Chinese,

00:17:39.913 --> 00:17:44.358
or Indians--the smallest unit
of desire which they speak of is

00:17:44.358 --> 00:17:46.941
the family;
very hard to get them to think

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:47.930
of what THEY want.
 

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.676
It's the family,
or village, or some larger

00:17:51.676 --> 00:17:52.480
entity.
 

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.018
When you start changing norms,
the norms in non-Western

00:17:57.018 --> 00:18:02.311
societies or pre-modern western
societies are very much stronger

00:18:02.311 --> 00:18:04.750
in control of the people.
 

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.788
People have less latitude to go
and do their own thing;

00:18:07.788 --> 00:18:13.848
they're under social--much more
social control.

00:18:13.848 --> 00:18:18.512
Of course all of these things
multiply--square these things,

00:18:18.512 --> 00:18:22.150
quadruple them,
if you're talking about sex.

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:24.215
One of the readings,
I don't know if you're going to

00:18:24.215 --> 00:18:26.526
do it tonight or you did it
already, about the Palestinian

00:18:26.526 --> 00:18:27.538
woman who was killed.
 

00:18:27.538 --> 00:18:32.328
Did you--was that--not in your
reading yet.

00:18:32.328 --> 00:18:36.769
What it is, that a Palestinian
woman was suspected of some

00:18:36.769 --> 00:18:39.656
infidelity,
no hard evidence for it,

00:18:39.656 --> 00:18:44.151
and her little brother killed
her after searching for her for

00:18:44.151 --> 00:18:45.200
many years.
 

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.368
The idea of giving you that
article is it's a tear jerker,

00:18:49.368 --> 00:18:56.440
but it gives you an idea of the
emotionality of the--

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.532
strength with which the older
social norms are held and

00:18:59.532 --> 00:19:01.710
someone who appears on the
surface,

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:05.470
even mildly,
to violate it,

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.930
can get killed.
 

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:14.240
A Jordanian woman has just come
out with a book 2003,

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.835
Honor Lost,
and she talked about her best

00:19:16.835 --> 00:19:19.099
friend and this is what
triggered her,

00:19:19.099 --> 00:19:20.608
apparently, to write the book.
 

00:19:20.608 --> 00:19:23.855
This woman, her friend,
had been seen in public walking

00:19:23.855 --> 00:19:26.019
with a man who was not a
relative.

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:28.269
Now not doing anything bad but
right there in public,

00:19:28.269 --> 00:19:33.490
so you know nothing was going
on on the streets and this being

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.664
seen alone--
being seen on the streets with

00:19:36.664 --> 00:19:40.615
a man who was not a relative was
such a stain on the family's

00:19:40.615 --> 00:19:44.301
honor that the woman's father
stabbed her 12 times in the

00:19:44.301 --> 00:19:48.185
chest and then stood over the
body to make sure that she was

00:19:48.185 --> 00:19:50.818
dead before calling an
ambulance.

00:19:50.818 --> 00:19:55.566
Imagine the strength of the
cultural norms that allows a

00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:59.708
brother to kill a sister,
or a father to kill his

00:19:59.708 --> 00:20:00.828
daughter.
 

00:20:00.828 --> 00:20:03.545
In this last case,
this woman who the father

00:20:03.545 --> 00:20:06.598
killed her,
the family was not poor and was

00:20:06.598 --> 00:20:09.403
not Muslim,
even though it's in Jordan but

00:20:09.403 --> 00:20:12.118
they were middle class and Roman
Catholic.

00:20:12.118 --> 00:20:16.413
So that means--almost nobody in
these cultures escapes the

00:20:16.413 --> 00:20:20.632
cultural norms even though
Catholics in Jordan are a very

00:20:20.632 --> 00:20:24.548
small minority as is the middle
class in Jordan.

00:20:24.548 --> 00:20:29.848
They obey the same rules of the
culture as everyone else.

00:20:29.848 --> 00:20:33.615
The author of that book claims
that this happens to thousands

00:20:33.615 --> 00:20:37.317
of women, that there's thousands
of women dying in honor--so

00:20:37.317 --> 00:20:38.950
called honor killings.
 

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:40.830
Now, of course,
it's not restricted to the

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:43.500
Middle East,
you will read a little bit

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.614
later a reading for India where
a woman is raped by her

00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:52.109
father-in-law and her own father
insists on killing her.

00:20:52.109 --> 00:20:54.288
That's from India.
 

00:20:54.288 --> 00:20:58.368
You have to contrast this with,
not all cultures are like this,

00:20:58.368 --> 00:21:05.390
so contrast this very tight
strict norm about women's--

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:08.267
not giving women any
possibility for going beyond the

00:21:08.267 --> 00:21:10.315
norm,
compare it with the Na of China

00:21:10.315 --> 00:21:12.180
which I think you've already
read,

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.868
where everything is totally
free, or the Japanese,

00:21:14.868 --> 00:21:18.380
the story of the Suye Mura
women;

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:20.269
have you read that yet?
 

00:21:20.269 --> 00:21:22.960
Again, there's a huge amount of
sexual freedom.

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:29.098
So it isn't that all cultures
have the same cultural norms,

00:21:29.098 --> 00:21:34.548
but they all do have cultural
norms and violation of those

00:21:34.548 --> 00:21:37.798
cultural norms will be punished.
 

00:21:37.798 --> 00:21:41.078
Another thing is that,
in the different stream,

00:21:41.078 --> 00:21:44.759
the Western and Eastern
fertility transition,

00:21:44.759 --> 00:21:48.532
is that the economic
constraints, the level of

00:21:48.532 --> 00:21:53.647
poverty in the third world is
much worse than it was in Europe

00:21:53.647 --> 00:21:56.500
at the time of its transition.
 

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.347
Everything is more difficult
when you're poor and you live in

00:22:00.347 --> 00:22:03.363
a poor country with poorly
developed government,

00:22:03.363 --> 00:22:05.480
everything is more difficult.
 

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:10.999
In your reading packet is a one
page collection of headlines

00:22:10.999 --> 00:22:16.611
from Tanzania and you just see
all the problems that Tanzania

00:22:16.611 --> 00:22:22.223
is going through in a period
when their fertility is high and

00:22:22.223 --> 00:22:26.338
maybe beginning to start falling
down.

00:22:26.338 --> 00:22:32.977
We have some understanding of
the many ways in which

00:22:32.977 --> 00:22:36.479
statistically,
except by magnitude,

00:22:36.479 --> 00:22:39.638
the fertility of the
demographic transition in the

00:22:39.638 --> 00:22:43.380
countries that have entered
since 1960 looks very different

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.960
from those that entered it in
1860.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.010
Quantitatively also,
when you go through a period of

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:53.121
population growth,
the question is well how much

00:22:53.121 --> 00:22:55.904
did your population grow
altogether between the beginning

00:22:55.904 --> 00:22:58.886
of the transition which we've
had the beginning in Europe and

00:22:58.886 --> 00:23:04.395
the end in Europe,
as your text says something

00:23:04.395 --> 00:23:14.309
like 1870 to 1930 and Europe
grew by about a factor of four,

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:16.970
so the population quadrupled.
 

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.787
This was the time when the
population of the developing

00:23:19.787 --> 00:23:21.509
countries was staying constant.
 

00:23:21.509 --> 00:23:24.548
But developing countries--India
actually,

00:23:24.548 --> 00:23:27.474
as far as we can predict,
is having one of the smallest

00:23:27.474 --> 00:23:30.949
between four and five,
so they're sort of at the

00:23:30.949 --> 00:23:34.269
maximum for Europe,
no country in Europe was more

00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:36.921
than four and India,
one of the lowest countries for

00:23:36.921 --> 00:23:39.730
the developing world,
would be somewhere between four

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:41.000
and five so we expect.
 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.308
Mexico will have grown by a
factor of seven to ten times;

00:23:45.308 --> 00:23:49.680
Kenya by more than fifteen
times, so here is again,

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.150
countries that started the
transition poor,

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:56.755
they're still moderately poor,
Mexico is doing better but

00:23:56.755 --> 00:24:01.690
certainly Kenya is not and India
is doing somewhat better.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.537
And now they have to cope with
five, six, seven,

00:24:05.537 --> 00:24:09.140
eight, nine,
ten times as much population.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.045
Because of these multipliers,
the fraction of people in the

00:24:13.045 --> 00:24:17.017
different parts of the world
goes first one way and then the

00:24:17.017 --> 00:24:17.960
other way.
 

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:22.208
Before the mortality
transition, Europeans

00:24:22.208 --> 00:24:27.390
represented about 18% of the
world's population.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.078
At its maximum,
when Europe had the maximum,

00:24:30.078 --> 00:24:32.180
Europe and European people in
America,

00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:33.868
Australia, New Zealand and so
forth,

00:24:33.868 --> 00:24:37.660
but European stock people their
fraction--

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.230
the European fraction of the
world population doubled,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:45.089
more than doubled actually
from--about doubled from 18% to

00:24:45.089 --> 00:24:47.127
35% so they--
Europe was

00:24:47.127 --> 00:24:51.226
undergoing--Europeans were
undergoing a huge population

00:24:51.226 --> 00:24:51.910
thing.
 

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:57.509
Now--by 1995 because Europe's
population growth is over,

00:24:57.509 --> 00:25:01.940
European people's are over,
and the developing countries

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.612
population growth is starting
it's back to where it started

00:25:06.612 --> 00:25:09.108
and it's back to about 18%.
 

00:25:09.108 --> 00:25:13.765
Now--that's 1995 and we've had
already 13 years of population

00:25:13.765 --> 00:25:17.877
growth continuing in the
developing countries and it's

00:25:17.877 --> 00:25:21.058
continuing and getting more and
more.

00:25:21.058 --> 00:25:25.818
The relative percentage of
people in,

00:25:25.818 --> 00:25:29.433
what's now called the
developing world versus the

00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:32.701
European world,
is going now to be so high in

00:25:32.701 --> 00:25:36.522
the developing countries that
it's way beyond anything that

00:25:36.522 --> 00:25:41.040
was historically the case,
except maybe when humans

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:47.500
started moving out of Africa and
into the Middle East and into

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.558
Europe.
 

00:25:48.558 --> 00:25:52.711
This may not stabilize--so far
there is no sign that European

00:25:52.711 --> 00:25:55.374
population,
almost all of the European

00:25:55.374 --> 00:25:59.347
populations now have fertility
rates below 2.1 and so they are

00:25:59.347 --> 00:26:01.626
going--
if they continue with that of

00:26:01.626 --> 00:26:04.210
course they eventually disappear
altogether,

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:09.224
and the idea that there's going
to be some stabilization at some

00:26:09.224 --> 00:26:13.285
ratio of say rich and poor
countries is dependent on

00:26:13.285 --> 00:26:18.299
fertility coming up in developed
countries and we don't have any

00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:20.528
reason to expect that.
 

00:26:20.528 --> 00:26:23.278
This is an important factor
because,

00:26:23.278 --> 00:26:30.028
if part of the developing
countries coming out of poverty,

00:26:30.028 --> 00:26:33.318
is aid from the West and that's
again--

00:26:33.318 --> 00:26:35.769
everything is debatable in this
course,

00:26:35.769 --> 00:26:38.410
how much help aid does.
 

00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:39.999
It actually--there's no
question about that in some

00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:41.078
cases it's tremendously helpful.
 

00:26:41.078 --> 00:26:46.112
That if there's nobody left in
the developed countries to give

00:26:46.112 --> 00:26:50.641
the aid,
then one of the props which

00:26:50.641 --> 00:26:58.420
helps developing countries come
up will have disappeared.

00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.769
We've gone through the
quantities of the transition,

00:27:02.769 --> 00:27:06.042
but we have compared the
demographic transition of

00:27:06.042 --> 00:27:09.250
developing countries with
European countries,

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:15.410
but we haven't compared it to
anything else.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:21.271
The world population,
as I say, is growing something

00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:25.640
like 70 to 80 million people a
year.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.012
The question is,
if we imagine some sort of a

00:27:29.012 --> 00:27:32.615
landing for this,
what kinds of things are going

00:27:32.615 --> 00:27:35.529
to stop this population
explosion?

00:27:35.529 --> 00:27:38.279
There's bad things and there's
good things;

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:41.210
bad possibilities and good
possibilities.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:45.338
The bad possibilities and have
been known--

00:27:45.338 --> 00:27:48.279
have been thought about for a
long time is 1) famine,

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:51.529
that people could start
starving, disease,

00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:54.291
AIDS, people are always talking
about Aids balancing the

00:27:54.291 --> 00:27:55.798
population explosion or war.
 

00:27:55.798 --> 00:27:59.752
I'm going to give you some idea
of the magnitude of these

00:27:59.752 --> 00:28:00.460
factors.
 

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.000
Famine, one way that famine
operates is,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.400
some country has a big drought
and they go through a short

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:11.220
period of terrible famine,
but that's not the main thing.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.990
People all over world and
especially children are

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:20.858
malnourished and malnourished
leads to disease.

00:28:20.858 --> 00:28:25.063
It's very hard to get these
statistics and to gather these

00:28:25.063 --> 00:28:29.118
statistics, and it depends on
who you're talking too.

00:28:29.118 --> 00:28:33.017
I was teaching in a health
course and we sort of did serial

00:28:33.017 --> 00:28:37.082
lectures and Michelle Barry,
a professor of international

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:41.298
infectious diseases,
gave the lecture before mine,

00:28:41.298 --> 00:28:46.250
so I went to her lecture to see
the lay of the land,

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:50.190
and she was describing millions
of deaths from various diseases.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.358
The medical students,
this was to medical students,

00:28:52.358 --> 00:28:55.622
had no clue and they were just
absolutely shocked at the

00:28:55.622 --> 00:28:58.924
magnitude of what's going on,
especially in developing

00:28:58.924 --> 00:28:59.568
countries.
 

00:28:59.568 --> 00:29:01.642
She was listing,
maybe you know,

00:29:01.642 --> 00:29:04.983
Aids is about--back then it was
two million a year,

00:29:04.983 --> 00:29:08.058
it might be three million and
coming down;

00:29:08.058 --> 00:29:11.931
Malaria, tuberculosis from the
one to two million deaths a year

00:29:11.931 --> 00:29:14.558
kind of thing;
diarrhea in children, etc.

00:29:14.558 --> 00:29:19.170
These are--the massive killers
in the world.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:22.450
Next week I came on and said,
you know what,

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:26.271
there's x millions of deaths
from malnutrition and they were

00:29:26.271 --> 00:29:29.704
shocked because it was an even
bigger number then what

00:29:29.704 --> 00:29:31.390
Dr. Barry had given.
 

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:34.637
I said, you know what,
they're the same deaths you

00:29:34.637 --> 00:29:36.230
heard about last week.
 

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.920
The thing is something like--I
don't remember the number,

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:43.358
something like if you take a
skin test for tuberculosis,

00:29:43.358 --> 00:29:47.622
something like a third to a
half of us have been exposed to

00:29:47.622 --> 00:29:51.368
the TB bug so that we have
antibodies against it.

00:29:51.368 --> 00:29:54.244
We basically in some sense,
in a small sense,

00:29:54.244 --> 00:29:55.160
have had TB.
 

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:59.239
If you go to India more people
have had it but the fraction

00:29:59.239 --> 00:30:02.334
that actually come down and get
sick is much,

00:30:02.334 --> 00:30:03.460
much higher.
 

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.119
Why?
 

00:30:04.119 --> 00:30:05.318
Malnutrition.
 

00:30:05.318 --> 00:30:08.017
That all of the diseases,
if you're malnourished your

00:30:08.017 --> 00:30:10.923
immune system and your other
body systems can't fight the

00:30:10.923 --> 00:30:13.635
bug,
so you actually get sick and

00:30:13.635 --> 00:30:14.920
will often die.
 

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:21.291
There's a big discussion of
when you see a death to say TB,

00:30:21.291 --> 00:30:27.773
is that death caused by the
tuberculosis bacillus or is that

00:30:27.773 --> 00:30:31.400
death caused by malnutrition?
 

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.873
The World Health Organization
and a lot of other groups are

00:30:35.873 --> 00:30:40.654
now saying that the about half
the deaths from all these things

00:30:40.654 --> 00:30:44.279
are really at base caused by
malnutrition,

00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:47.470
that at the level of infection
that the people are exposed to,

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:52.538
you should see so many deaths
but you actually see twice that

00:30:52.538 --> 00:30:55.920
many deaths because people are
hungry.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:59.710
The numbers from the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:04.660
United Nations are--
is that 25,000 people die every

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.646
day,
like today, 25,000 people will

00:31:07.646 --> 00:31:10.480
die from starvation or
malnutrition.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.338
That's a huge number.
 

00:31:12.338 --> 00:31:16.907
That's nine million deaths a
year and so I calculated it out,

00:31:16.907 --> 00:31:21.249
during the course of this
lecture 1,300 people will die of

00:31:21.249 --> 00:31:23.609
starvation or malnutrition.
 

00:31:23.609 --> 00:31:26.950
It's really very serious.
 

00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.278
Most of the death--yeah?
 

00:31:28.278 --> 00:31:29.906
Student:  How many
people are born during this

00:31:29.906 --> 00:31:30.220
lecture?
 

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:31.160
Prof: What?
 

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:33.518
Student:  How many
people will be born during this

00:31:33.518 --> 00:31:33.940
lecture?
 

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:36.578
Prof: Also a very large
number, more than the deaths.

00:31:36.578 --> 00:31:40.852
We've seen that the--you can
calculate it yourself that the

00:31:40.852 --> 00:31:44.019
birthrate is something like
three times,

00:31:44.019 --> 00:31:45.288
two and a half times the death
rate,

00:31:45.288 --> 00:31:49.279
but that's not just that--you
can sort of double the total

00:31:49.279 --> 00:31:52.920
number of deaths will be
something a little more than

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.789
double the deaths from
malnutrition,

00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:56.670
so a lot.
 

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:00.306
The population is still growing
I'll bet, as you've seen,

00:32:00.306 --> 00:32:03.422
because we do have a lot more
births than deaths,

00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:05.890
and I showed you that data
before.

00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:09.803
Malnutrition is the leading
cause of death in children in

00:32:09.803 --> 00:32:15.193
developing countries,
and the numbers you read are

00:32:15.193 --> 00:32:20.397
all over the place,
and one number that I pulled

00:32:20.397 --> 00:32:25.667
out is 13 million child deaths a
year and I've seen lower than

00:32:25.667 --> 00:32:26.358
that.
 

00:32:26.358 --> 00:32:29.990
The World Bank in the--it's
millennium goals,

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:32.146
you know the big millennium
goal thing what the whole world

00:32:32.146 --> 00:32:34.856
is supposed to go to,
says again, that half the

00:32:34.856 --> 00:32:39.220
deaths of children under five
are due to malnutrition and--

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:41.298
there's altogether,
for all reasons,

00:32:41.298 --> 00:32:45.590
there's 13 million child deaths
a year and you get numbers from

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:49.327
different studies saying
anywhere between a third and a

00:32:49.327 --> 00:32:52.720
half of these deaths are due to
malnutrition.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.130
What does malnutrition look
like?

00:32:54.130 --> 00:33:00.983
You may have seen--this is
kwashiorkor, how many of you

00:33:00.983 --> 00:33:03.650
have heard of that?
 

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:04.660
It's a very prevalent kind of
thing.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.808
Do I have a slide?
 

00:33:05.808 --> 00:33:10.105
You go to a village in poor
places and you see these

00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:11.788
distended bellies?
 

00:33:11.788 --> 00:33:15.554
This is everywhere and actually
we don't even--in --there's a

00:33:15.554 --> 00:33:19.006
tremendously prevalent thing,
we don't actually know the

00:33:19.006 --> 00:33:20.009
cause of it.
 

00:33:20.009 --> 00:33:24.117
The old story was that it's a
protein deficiency disease and

00:33:24.117 --> 00:33:27.808
protein makes albumin and
albumin holds water into the

00:33:27.808 --> 00:33:31.736
blood and the tissues,
and when you can't hold water,

00:33:31.736 --> 00:33:35.420
it sort of floods into your
tissues and spreads out,

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.170
but now there's a lot of other
theories and we just don't know

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:42.058
really what's the basic cause of
kwashiorkor.

00:33:42.058 --> 00:33:43.484
It is malnutrition.
 

00:33:43.484 --> 00:33:47.688
That's--there's no question
about it, but exactly what in

00:33:47.688 --> 00:33:50.990
the diet is missing is not
totally clear.

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:55.046
Here's another kind of shocking
thing, now I'm going to give you

00:33:55.046 --> 00:33:58.651
some shocking pictures and
tearjerkers but it's important

00:33:58.651 --> 00:33:59.359
to see.
 

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:01.519
This you've seen.
 

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:05.075
This is an American missionary
or aid worker,

00:34:05.075 --> 00:34:09.762
I don't know which and that's
her baby and that's this baby

00:34:09.762 --> 00:34:13.480
and they're both six months old
in Africa.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:17.960
Another thing that happens is
that population--

00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:21.503
when population grows the
people who are strongest take

00:34:21.503 --> 00:34:25.639
the best land and they push out
people that are less strong,

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:28.320
or have less population or are
less violent or whatever reason,

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.342
or less technologically
advanced, they push them into

00:34:31.342 --> 00:34:33.030
marginal land like deserts.
 

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:37.503
This is the site in Mali of
what used to be one of the

00:34:37.503 --> 00:34:42.231
largest lakes in Africa and then
it goes through periodic

00:34:42.231 --> 00:34:45.820
climatic things;
it dries out every so often.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.623
In some sense,
people should not be living

00:34:48.623 --> 00:34:51.360
there because you know it's
going to--

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.030
it goes every so often through
droughts,

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.230
but they have no choice because
stronger people's in the past

00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:59.110
have pushed them into these
desert kind of regions,

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.710
one of the results of
population explosion.

00:35:01.710 --> 00:35:04.340
I've told you,
in Europe, where the extra

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:08.550
farmers had to go up hillsides
and into less profitable land,

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:14.001
so there they are in this very
arid region and in normal years

00:35:14.001 --> 00:35:17.784
they can survive,
but then comes a drought and

00:35:17.784 --> 00:35:20.920
this kind of thing happens and
the result,

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:24.490
of course--this is a boy who is
I think nine years old or

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:29.306
something,
he's 13 pounds and almost

00:35:29.306 --> 00:35:34.889
impossible to keep that boy
alive.

00:35:34.889 --> 00:35:38.369
Here's one of the really
saddening pictures that--

00:35:38.369 --> 00:35:43.150
in the political discourse
about population,

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.715
and fertility,
and family planning in America

00:35:45.715 --> 00:35:49.927
there's a lot about motherhood,
how wonderful motherhood is --

00:35:49.927 --> 00:35:53.469
everything but you have to see--
well I didn't show that.

00:35:53.469 --> 00:35:57.871
I've got--I put in the wrong
picture which is maybe good for

00:35:57.871 --> 00:35:58.320
you.
 

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.409
Now you've seen a lot of these
pictures.

00:36:00.409 --> 00:36:03.032
The organizations,
they want you to give money

00:36:03.032 --> 00:36:06.590
show a lot of them and one of
the discussion items about these

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.971
kind of pictures is that they
make people in poor countries

00:36:09.971 --> 00:36:12.768
seem sort of helpless and that's
not true.

00:36:12.768 --> 00:36:16.253
The amount of stuff that people
in these countries are doing to

00:36:16.253 --> 00:36:18.389
try to help themselves is
enormous,

00:36:18.389 --> 00:36:20.139
they can be very strong and
very smart people,

00:36:20.139 --> 00:36:27.539
but their resources are very
limited what they work with.

00:36:27.539 --> 00:36:34.121
The bottom line of this little
bit is that given the number of

00:36:34.121 --> 00:36:40.813
deaths that we understand to be
from malnutrition and given the

00:36:40.813 --> 00:36:47.286
number of population increase,
if the solution is to be solved

00:36:47.286 --> 00:36:49.530
by famine,
if the balancing of births and

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:51.250
deaths is going to be a famine
situation,

00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:55.340
the starvation rate must
increase by a factor of eight,

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:57.960
plus or minus.
 

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:01.913
The next thing is disease;
disease is the second of our

00:37:01.913 --> 00:37:03.710
triplet of horrible solutions.
 

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:07.005
In 2008 it killed about three
million people,

00:37:07.005 --> 00:37:10.826
up from two million,
and this is clearly--apparently

00:37:10.826 --> 00:37:11.800
the peak.
 

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:15.668
Everyone apparently--Because of
the retrovirals and various

00:37:15.668 --> 00:37:19.469
other public health measures,
the number is supposed to go

00:37:19.469 --> 00:37:20.070
down.
 

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.460
The numbers are already
changing.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:26.623
At the end of 2007,
the UN got a whole bunch of

00:37:26.623 --> 00:37:31.510
better data from certain
countries and they had to--

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:36.331
they lowered the number of
people they thought to be

00:37:36.331 --> 00:37:40.679
infected with the AIDS virus by
6.3 million.

00:37:40.679 --> 00:37:44.860
So something like 33 million
people infected with AIDS,

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.829
and presumably they will all
die at some point,

00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:51.349
although the retrovirals can
keep them alive a long time.

00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:56.150
Notice that 33 million is less
than half of one year's

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.869
population growth from AIDS.
 

00:37:58.869 --> 00:38:04.190
It's--the way it works out
demographically is here is

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:10.175
somewhat older data at the--
from the peak of the AIDS

00:38:10.175 --> 00:38:12.992
epidemic,
this is the impact in

00:38:12.992 --> 00:38:16.130
Sub-Saharan Africa with and
without AIDS,

00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:23.306
so the gray--the purple is the
way the population -was modeled

00:38:23.306 --> 00:38:27.965
to increase without AIDS,
as if there was no AIDS,

00:38:27.965 --> 00:38:30.554
and then with AIDS,
AIDS kills these people

00:38:30.554 --> 00:38:32.679
basically, prevents these
births,

00:38:32.679 --> 00:38:36.240
you still have an enormous
population increase for

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:40.239
Sub-Saharan Africa which is the
worst affected place.

00:38:40.239 --> 00:38:43.670
This is one of the worst
scenarios --they did a worst

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:47.429
case scenario run which they
sort of imagined things to be

00:38:47.429 --> 00:38:49.739
about as bad as they could get.
 

00:38:49.739 --> 00:38:53.340
This thing, when you do it for
a whole--most of a continent

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.594
hides a lot of difference;
this is Uganda,

00:38:56.594 --> 00:39:02.349
which had a very intelligent
response to AIDS and here,

00:39:02.349 --> 00:39:05.043
with AIDS there will be this
much, and without AIDS there

00:39:05.043 --> 00:39:08.199
would have been this much,
but population keeps growing.

00:39:08.199 --> 00:39:10.007
In any case,
in South Africa,

00:39:10.007 --> 00:39:14.010
which is about the worst really
badly hit place you do see that

00:39:14.010 --> 00:39:17.561
population growth without AIDS
would be this and they're

00:39:17.561 --> 00:39:21.436
actually expecting population
growth to come down as a result

00:39:21.436 --> 00:39:22.469
of AIDS.
 

00:39:22.469 --> 00:39:25.746
In some countries,
it has an important demographic

00:39:25.746 --> 00:39:28.824
effect, but for Sub-Saharan
Africa, as a whole,

00:39:28.824 --> 00:39:30.630
not an enormous effect.
 

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:33.114
In the rest of world,
where, at least so far,

00:39:33.114 --> 00:39:35.768
the numbers are much smaller,
a minor effect.

00:39:35.768 --> 00:39:38.516
It can easily get lost in the
statistical noise that we don't

00:39:38.516 --> 00:39:40.210
know how many people are on
earth,

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:45.456
we don't know exactly how fast
the population is growing and

00:39:45.456 --> 00:39:49.369
AIDS can be within that
statistical noise.

00:39:49.369 --> 00:39:55.369
From a demographic point of
view, AIDS as a killer,

00:39:55.369 --> 00:39:57.409
is significant.
 

00:39:57.409 --> 00:40:01.695
Let me show you there's another
thing that kills 1.6 million

00:40:01.695 --> 00:40:04.820
people more than half of the
AIDS number.

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:08.730
You'll never guess what that is?
 

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:12.780
It's this, it's smoke from
cooking fires,

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.103
that in the developing
countries, in the poor

00:40:15.103 --> 00:40:17.702
countries,
this is the way people cook and

00:40:17.702 --> 00:40:20.731
the smoke fills the room,
gets into their lungs,

00:40:20.731 --> 00:40:24.257
and they get all kinds of
diseases extra and the estimates

00:40:24.257 --> 00:40:28.918
of that is 1.6 million deaths;
comparable to tuberculosis and

00:40:28.918 --> 00:40:32.150
malaria and somewhat less than
AIDS.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:36.443
They have a solution to this
and it's a stove that

00:40:36.443 --> 00:40:41.090
keeps--that you don't get these
kind of smoke with.

00:40:41.090 --> 00:40:46.340
And those cost $10 each and
they'll cut out a number of

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:50.909
deaths equivalent to half of the
AIDS deaths.

00:40:50.909 --> 00:40:54.286
One of the things--if you're
interested in understanding the

00:40:54.286 --> 00:40:56.690
magnitude of the problems of the
world,

00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:59.742
one of the things you just have
to pay attention is the

00:40:59.742 --> 00:41:03.190
magnitude of the problem and the
magnitude of any solution.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:08.056
When there's an almost sure
thing of $10 available and

00:41:08.056 --> 00:41:13.476
retrovirals cost an awful lot
more, which kind of person are

00:41:13.476 --> 00:41:16.139
you going to try to save?
 

00:41:16.139 --> 00:41:19.920
The person that can be saved by
$10 or the person that needs

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.510
$1,000 to be saved if you have
limited kinds of money.

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:28.400
From a demographic point of
view the problem with--

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.632
almost worse than the total
number of deaths because

00:41:31.632 --> 00:41:34.739
malaria's been killing people
for a long time,

00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:36.800
and TB and these are all
horrible situations,

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.860
of course every death is a
horrible sort of thing,

00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:44.989
but AIDS kills people in the
prime of their life and that's--

00:41:44.989 --> 00:41:47.731
this is what we call hollowing
out of the Age structure so

00:41:47.731 --> 00:41:49.559
there's children who are
dependent,

00:41:49.559 --> 00:41:52.045
there's adults who work and
there's old people who are

00:41:52.045 --> 00:41:52.610
dependent.
 

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:56.650
If you kill off your working
people that leaves the kids with

00:41:56.650 --> 00:42:00.393
no one to take care of them,
no one to provide economically

00:42:00.393 --> 00:42:03.411
for them,
that leaves the old people with

00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:05.670
no one to take care of them.
 

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:12.929
The direct deaths from AIDS
itself is one horrible thing,

00:42:12.929 --> 00:42:17.637
but what they do to taking care
of everybody else in the

00:42:17.637 --> 00:42:21.489
population multiples that effect
by a lot,

00:42:21.489 --> 00:42:24.860
and as of 2001 the last
statistics that I could find,

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:29.822
there's about 12 million
children that have been orphaned

00:42:29.822 --> 00:42:31.949
in Africa due to AIDS.
 

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:36.130
That is--we do a lot of work in
the political refugees,

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:40.465
that's triple the number of
political refugees that there

00:42:40.465 --> 00:42:41.860
are in Africa.
 

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:45.659
We've done famine,
disease, and wars is the last

00:42:45.659 --> 00:42:50.431
set of numbers and you hear it
at cocktail parties that some

00:42:50.431 --> 00:42:52.918
war,
whatever the current war is,

00:42:52.918 --> 00:42:54.929
will balance births and deaths.
 

00:42:54.929 --> 00:42:58.250
The worst we've had is the atom
bombs,

00:42:58.250 --> 00:43:01.163
and I don't know if you know
what the numbers on the atom

00:43:01.163 --> 00:43:03.972
bombs are,
but the Hiroshima bomb killed

00:43:03.972 --> 00:43:07.668
75,000 people,
the Nagasaki bomb killed 25,000

00:43:07.668 --> 00:43:08.320
people.
 

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:14.780
That's 100,000 people dead in
two quick flashes.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:20.989
The population on earth grows
by approximately 200,000 a day.

00:43:20.989 --> 00:43:22.949
What that means is that,
if we can imagine,

00:43:22.949 --> 00:43:27.032
and all these are imaginary,
if we imagine that some wars

00:43:27.032 --> 00:43:31.552
are going to balance births and
deaths on earth that means that

00:43:31.552 --> 00:43:35.563
every day you have to blow up
two Nagasaki bombs and two

00:43:35.563 --> 00:43:38.672
Hiroshima bombs,
killing that equivalent number

00:43:38.672 --> 00:43:40.059
of people just to keep even.
 

00:43:40.059 --> 00:43:44.949
That doesn't reduce population,
that just keeps population

00:43:44.949 --> 00:43:45.550
flat.
 

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:50.023
The idea of giving you all
these horrible numbers is just

00:43:50.023 --> 00:43:54.657
to give you an idea of the
magnitude of this issue and that

00:43:54.657 --> 00:43:58.891
it's of course absolutely
unthinkable that one sort of

00:43:58.891 --> 00:44:03.525
continues to just let this
situation go rampantly until one

00:44:03.525 --> 00:44:07.679
of these negative kind of
disasters happens.

00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:11.179
There's got to be a solution.
 

00:44:11.179 --> 00:44:16.139
We have to figure it out in
some way.

00:44:16.139 --> 00:44:19.572
So far in the last lecture or
so, I've obviously been what we

00:44:19.572 --> 00:44:20.659
call apocalyptic.
 

00:44:20.659 --> 00:44:26.809
The world is coming to an end
due to population explosion,

00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:30.159
but there's a famous saying to
the opposite,

00:44:30.159 --> 00:44:32.949
which is that if something
can't go on forever,

00:44:32.949 --> 00:44:34.989
it won't.
 

00:44:34.989 --> 00:44:40.702
I think that has a large chance
of happening and I've described

00:44:40.702 --> 00:44:46.231
some of this already to you in
our last lecture and I'm going

00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:49.550
to talk more about it right now.
 

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:54.432
Consider these two interviews,
one is an interview very much

00:44:54.432 --> 00:44:58.985
like one of the ones in your
readings, it's from Mali in

00:44:58.985 --> 00:45:00.309
1983, Sitan.
 

00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:04.400
This is a woman who's heard
about the contraceptive pill but

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.650
has not used it.
 

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:07.170
Interviewer:
"Sitan,

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:10.590
how many children more would
you like to have?"

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.570
"That is for God to
decide."

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:14.980
Interviewer:
"You yourself,

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.150
how many more children would
you like--

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:20.240
how many children would you
like to have in your whole

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.000
life?"
 

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.179
"I don't know the number.
 

00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:26.059
It's when God stops my
births."

00:45:26.059 --> 00:45:27.474
Interviewer:
"How many boys and how

00:45:27.474 --> 00:45:29.000
many girls would you like to
have?"

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.340
"It's God that gives me
children.

00:45:30.340 --> 00:45:34.001
Since it is God that gives or
not, you cannot make a choice

00:45:34.001 --> 00:45:35.768
about your children."
 

00:45:35.768 --> 00:45:37.280
You've read some of these,
this is a different country,

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.929
a different time,
but this is a not uncommon sort

00:45:40.929 --> 00:45:44.913
of attitude where people,
women especially,

00:45:44.913 --> 00:45:50.798
just can't--it's not within
their calculus of conscious

00:45:50.798 --> 00:45:51.889
choice.
 

00:45:51.889 --> 00:45:54.927
Now in Bangladesh,
which is again,

00:45:54.927 --> 00:45:59.809
both of these countries are
Muslim, Bangladesh is more

00:45:59.809 --> 00:46:02.480
conservative religiously.
 

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:07.449
The poverty getting better now,
but it was about the same,

00:46:07.449 --> 00:46:11.231
so there's the socioeconomic
indicators for the two countries

00:46:11.231 --> 00:46:14.112
are about the same,
but the government in

00:46:14.112 --> 00:46:17.739
Bangladesh was very different
and the government,

00:46:17.739 --> 00:46:21.407
from very early on,
decided that they would make

00:46:21.407 --> 00:46:26.168
family planning available in the
country and the international

00:46:26.168 --> 00:46:29.289
groups then came on board and
said,

00:46:29.289 --> 00:46:33.400
okay, we will help you.
 

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:37.746
This is now another interview
with an 18 year old girl named

00:46:37.746 --> 00:46:41.650
Shamiran and she is just
learning that there is such a

00:46:41.650 --> 00:46:43.639
thing as birth control.
 

00:46:43.639 --> 00:46:47.010
The reason she knows about it
is that,

00:46:47.010 --> 00:46:49.943
and you'll read about--you're
going to read about the family

00:46:49.943 --> 00:46:52.429
planning program and the results
in Bangladesh,

00:46:52.429 --> 00:46:55.440
is that as I said Bangladesh is
a very conservative Muslim

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:55.969
country.
 

00:46:55.969 --> 00:46:59.469
So, women generally are not
allowed out of the house to get

00:46:59.469 --> 00:47:01.340
medical service for instance.
 

00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:03.773
Just to go out and talk to
women's meetings where these

00:47:03.773 --> 00:47:04.809
things get discussed.
 

00:47:04.809 --> 00:47:06.369
No. They can't do that.
 

00:47:06.369 --> 00:47:10.030
The family planning program in
Bangladesh,

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:11.929
the government program and the
private program,

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:15.739
hired high class women from
that community,

00:47:15.739 --> 00:47:19.898
who themselves were using
family planning and thought it

00:47:19.898 --> 00:47:24.056
was good and sent them into the
houses of poor women who

00:47:24.056 --> 00:47:25.719
couldn't come out.
 

00:47:25.719 --> 00:47:28.309
This is kind of like if
Muhammad--the mountain won't

00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:30.340
come to Muhammad,
Muhammad will go to the

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:31.000
mountain.
 

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.639
The people in the village all
know about this woman who,

00:47:33.639 --> 00:47:36.949
Mukti Ma, that was her name,
and she's considered a health

00:47:36.949 --> 00:47:39.329
worker and she actually gave her
aunt,

00:47:39.329 --> 00:47:42.860
her aunt was an acceptor and
Mukti Ma was giving--

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.961
came by regularly to give her
aunt pills and the girls knew

00:47:46.961 --> 00:47:47.739
about it.
 

00:47:47.739 --> 00:47:50.873
But they didn't really
understand it and so they went

00:47:50.873 --> 00:47:53.384
and asked the aunt,
the girl Shamiran,

00:47:53.384 --> 00:47:57.199
and the aunt refused to tell
her anything because again the

00:47:57.199 --> 00:48:00.239
social conservatism,
that these matters will be

00:48:00.239 --> 00:48:03.722
explained to her only when she
is married and she's not to know

00:48:03.722 --> 00:48:05.239
anything about this now.
 

00:48:05.239 --> 00:48:06.469
What did the kid do?
 

00:48:06.469 --> 00:48:08.762
Like every kid everywhere else
in the world she goes to school

00:48:08.762 --> 00:48:12.197
and talks with her friends,
and they all pick little bits

00:48:12.197 --> 00:48:17.054
of information or misinformation
and pull it together from the

00:48:17.054 --> 00:48:18.250
other girls.
 

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:21.273
Some of them apparently knew of
Mukti Ma, some of them didn't

00:48:21.273 --> 00:48:22.130
know about her.
 

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:23.510
I'm sorry I said everyone in
the village knows,

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:27.291
apparently they didn't,
but since this girl's aunt was

00:48:27.291 --> 00:48:30.789
getting pills from Mukti Ma she
knew about it,

00:48:30.789 --> 00:48:33.530
but every one of her
schoolmates was interested.

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:36.289
One girl said,
"I would like to work as

00:48:36.289 --> 00:48:38.280
she does,"
she Mukti Ma.

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:40.952
"Look at her,
she wears her sari so nicely

00:48:40.952 --> 00:48:43.159
and goes to different
neighborhoods.

00:48:43.159 --> 00:48:46.280
My sister told me she earns a
good amount of money."

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.755
Others said,
"but my father and

00:48:48.755 --> 00:48:52.079
grandmother says she's not a
good lady."

00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:54.947
Shamiran said,
"Grandmothers and fathers

00:48:54.947 --> 00:48:58.393
are always behind the times,
they do not want to let girls

00:48:58.393 --> 00:49:00.987
go to school,
I don't want to consider their

00:49:00.987 --> 00:49:03.487
opinions,
I like Mukti Ma's work and I

00:49:03.487 --> 00:49:06.150
will have pills to control
births."

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.782
Some girls said,
"Yes, I think we should

00:49:08.782 --> 00:49:12.313
have this medicine so we will
not have so many problems with

00:49:12.313 --> 00:49:13.570
so many children.
 

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:17.050
With few children,
we'll be able to keep our saris

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:20.742
clean and nice,"
Then everybody laughed together

00:49:20.742 --> 00:49:23.940
and that apparently ended that
interview.

00:49:23.940 --> 00:49:28.987
This is an older generation
versus a younger generation and

00:49:28.987 --> 00:49:32.119
there's an interest of the
girls,

00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:34.572
as they self perceive it,
and the interest of the older

00:49:34.572 --> 00:49:37.320
generation,
as they are trying to impose it

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.159
on the younger generation.
 

00:49:39.159 --> 00:49:42.010
It's a very clear kind of a
conflict situation.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.456
The girls see having many
children as just causing a lot

00:49:44.456 --> 00:49:47.172
of problems and what the girls
are interested in is not having

00:49:47.172 --> 00:49:49.545
a lot of children as--
which was terribly important to

00:49:49.545 --> 00:49:50.980
their--
certainly their grandparents

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:52.099
and probably their parents.
 

00:49:52.099 --> 00:49:55.329
They want to have nice clean
saris and look nice.

00:49:55.329 --> 00:49:59.371
They want to be able to earn
money and go around to different

00:49:59.371 --> 00:50:00.449
neighborhoods.
 

00:50:00.449 --> 00:50:04.485
The older generation is trying
to keep them out of school,

00:50:04.485 --> 00:50:08.876
keep this information away from
them, and keep them in the mold

00:50:08.876 --> 00:50:09.940
previously.
 

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.601
The girls in that society are
pretty much powerless because

00:50:14.601 --> 00:50:18.219
even though the age at marriage
has risen,

00:50:18.219 --> 00:50:21.467
Shamiran's already 18,
which traditionally is terribly

00:50:21.467 --> 00:50:23.489
old for a girl to be unmarried.
 

00:50:23.489 --> 00:50:26.369
She'll eventually get married,
moved in with her husband,

00:50:26.369 --> 00:50:29.802
and the husband will also be a
teenager probably and will have

00:50:29.802 --> 00:50:33.652
not much say --
the husband's mother will be

00:50:33.652 --> 00:50:38.168
the arbiter of medical things,
reproductive things,

00:50:38.168 --> 00:50:41.614
so that both the son and the
daughter-in-law will be under

00:50:41.614 --> 00:50:45.059
the control primarily of the
mother-in-law and so it's the

00:50:45.059 --> 00:50:47.599
mother-in-law's opinions that
count,

00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:51.199
the mother-in-law's attitude
toward reproduction that counts.

00:50:51.199 --> 00:50:53.266
Very often we,
in the west,

00:50:53.266 --> 00:50:56.012
say that--
the problem is all with men,

00:50:56.012 --> 00:50:59.985
the macho men force women into
having children and some of that

00:50:59.985 --> 00:51:03.893
is certainly true and sometimes
in Latin America a fair amount

00:51:03.893 --> 00:51:07.742
of that can be true,
but in Asia it's very often the

00:51:07.742 --> 00:51:08.800
mother-in-law.
 

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:10.230
Wherever you see that the young
girl--

00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:12.880
they get married young,
the husband and wife are both

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.596
young,
they move into the husband's

00:51:15.596 --> 00:51:18.820
house which is the grandparents
house,

00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.740
then the boy will be under
control of his mother and the

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.768
new wife will be perhaps almost
a slave to that mother.

00:51:24.768 --> 00:51:27.699
You have many,
many instances where both the

00:51:27.699 --> 00:51:31.721
boy--the husband and the young
girl wife do not want to have

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:34.719
children but they don't have any
choice.

00:51:34.719 --> 00:51:41.876
In matters of reproduction it's
mother-in-laws who are the

00:51:41.876 --> 00:51:49.659
dominant transmitters of culture
in the thing--in the world.

00:51:49.659 --> 00:51:53.393
I showed you in the data at the
beginning of last lecture that

00:51:53.393 --> 00:51:56.387
the Shamirans of the earth,
who are not so enamored of

00:51:56.387 --> 00:51:58.902
having a lot of children,
have taken over from the

00:51:58.902 --> 00:52:02.335
Sitan's of the earth,
who will have as many as

00:52:02.335 --> 00:52:04.420
they're going to have.
 

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:08.541
The data was very strong that
women in the developing

00:52:08.541 --> 00:52:13.217
countries don't want all the
children that they're currently

00:52:13.217 --> 00:52:14.090
having.
 

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:18.409
You've seen new data and you've
seen old data from that.

00:52:18.409 --> 00:52:20.010
I showed you Bolivia new data
you could--

00:52:20.010 --> 00:52:23.264
I can--you can come up to my
office and see the Demographic

00:52:23.264 --> 00:52:26.800
&amp; Health Surveys and pick a
country and it's pretty much all

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.530
the same.
 

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:30.503
With the exceptions of
Sub-Saharan Africa is somewhat

00:52:30.503 --> 00:52:33.018
exception and some of the Arab
countries,

00:52:33.018 --> 00:52:36.132
not the Muslim countries,
many Muslim countries have

00:52:36.132 --> 00:52:39.670
really reduced their fertility
but Arab countries are going

00:52:39.670 --> 00:52:41.929
through a non-standard
situation.

00:52:41.929 --> 00:52:47.016
This information has
been--we've had this since about

00:52:47.016 --> 00:52:48.190
the 1960s.
 

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:51.996
We've had it for about a half a
century, knowledge that women in

00:52:51.996 --> 00:52:55.320
the developing world don't
really want the children that

00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:56.469
they're having.
 

00:52:56.469 --> 00:53:00.963
In the 1960s they started with
a survey called KAP,

00:53:00.963 --> 00:53:03.840
knowledge, attitude,
practice.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.869
Knowledge: did you know about
contraception?

00:53:06.869 --> 00:53:10.119
Attitude: do you want it,
what do you think about it?

00:53:10.119 --> 00:53:12.929
Practice: are you actually
using it?

00:53:12.929 --> 00:53:18.027
Then from 1972 to 1982 there
were surveys called The World

00:53:18.027 --> 00:53:23.036
Fertility Survey which were
improved from the KAP surveys

00:53:23.036 --> 00:53:28.940
and they reached 62 countries
with 350,000 women interviewed,

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:32.726
and then from 1985 they've been
coming along with these

00:53:32.726 --> 00:53:35.250
Demographic &amp;
Health Surveys,

00:53:35.250 --> 00:53:37.969
which are more or less
standardized across the world,

00:53:37.969 --> 00:53:42.590
and from which the data I gave
you came.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:48.043
If you listen to the verbal
report of these women,

00:53:48.043 --> 00:53:52.719
they say they don't want these
children.

00:53:52.719 --> 00:53:55.777
The question--you have to
always question--scientists

00:53:55.777 --> 00:53:58.483
always question everything,
okay they say that,

00:53:58.483 --> 00:53:59.601
but how much oomph!
 

00:53:59.601 --> 00:54:00.659
is behind it?
 

00:54:00.659 --> 00:54:02.760
It could be an interviewer
comes in,

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.612
obviously a very modern person,
you know that modern people

00:54:05.612 --> 00:54:08.710
sort of think that the modern
way is to have fewer children,

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:12.123
so you may very well answer
them in that way so you can

00:54:12.123 --> 00:54:14.210
never be sure of these surveys.
 

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:18.429
You always have to look at what
are people actually doing and

00:54:18.429 --> 00:54:22.860
there are various ways that you
can find out if this a real--

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:27.590
a desire backed by behavior.
 

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:31.922
One of the things is well how
permanent--of those women that

00:54:31.922 --> 00:54:35.007
choose some sort of family
planning method,

00:54:35.007 --> 00:54:36.769
how permanent is it?
 

00:54:36.769 --> 00:54:38.039
How good is it?
 

00:54:38.039 --> 00:54:43.012
It turns out that basically
everywhere in the world

00:54:43.012 --> 00:54:48.880
sterilization is the dominant
choice for family planning.

00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:52.472
In Brazil, for instance,
by the late 1980s and their

00:54:52.472 --> 00:54:55.079
fertility has come down from
then,

00:54:55.079 --> 00:55:00.431
40% of married women using
contraception in fact chose to

00:55:00.431 --> 00:55:04.539
be sterilized over all the other
methods.

00:55:04.539 --> 00:55:08.293
Now you might think that this
was the poorest women who chose

00:55:08.293 --> 00:55:10.860
this, that they were kind of
desperate.

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:13.320
Maybe they were influenced by
family planning workers to just

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.474
get it over with,
and I've heard polemical

00:55:16.474 --> 00:55:20.853
arguments saying that,
Oh, these sterilization things

00:55:20.853 --> 00:55:24.938
are because that was what was
pushed upon them by some family

00:55:24.938 --> 00:55:26.369
planning program'.
 

00:55:26.369 --> 00:55:30.481
In fact, statistics are very
clear that the higher the income

00:55:30.481 --> 00:55:33.907
level of the woman,
the greater likelihood that she

00:55:33.907 --> 00:55:36.099
was to choose sterilization.
 

00:55:36.099 --> 00:55:40.625
One of these--have any of you
seen this film about testing the

00:55:40.625 --> 00:55:45.300
birth control pill in Puerto
Rico called La Operacion?

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:49.065
It's sort of a far feminist
thing but very--shown very

00:55:49.065 --> 00:55:49.989
frequently.
 

00:55:49.989 --> 00:55:54.228
One of the places that the
birth control pill,

00:55:54.228 --> 00:55:59.219
invented in America,
was tested was in Puerto Rico.

00:55:59.219 --> 00:56:02.130
It shows a lot of people,
they're talking in Spanish,

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.896
but there's a narrator speaking
in English which most everybody

00:56:04.896 --> 00:56:07.338
can understand,
and the narrator is saying how

00:56:07.338 --> 00:56:10.615
terrible everything is and that
these women weren't told what

00:56:10.615 --> 00:56:11.489
was going on.
 

00:56:11.489 --> 00:56:14.943
What you see when the narrator
is speaking is an older woman

00:56:14.943 --> 00:56:17.929
who wasn't eligible to be a
subject in the test,

00:56:17.929 --> 00:56:21.898
at night climbing into the
window at the basement of the

00:56:21.898 --> 00:56:25.795
hospital to get the birth
control pill and the narrator

00:56:25.795 --> 00:56:29.110
says nothing about that,
but they're showing this to you.

00:56:29.110 --> 00:56:30.659
Have you seen it?
 

00:56:30.659 --> 00:56:32.929
I saw--had sort of a hand up.
 

00:56:32.929 --> 00:56:35.842
In the U.S.,
among affluent,

00:56:35.842 --> 00:56:42.206
educated women that nobody is
presumably pushing around 13.8

00:56:42.206 --> 00:56:45.262
million--
women use tubal ligation,

00:56:45.262 --> 00:56:49.364
a female form of sterilization
as their method of birth control

00:56:49.364 --> 00:56:53.268
and less than that 13.2 million
were using the birth control

00:56:53.268 --> 00:56:53.929
pill.
 

00:56:53.929 --> 00:56:59.074
In the United States,
like in almost every other

00:56:59.074 --> 00:57:04.000
country, sterilization is the
chosen means.

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:08.443
I think that's one indicator
that when people say they want

00:57:08.443 --> 00:57:11.510
reduced fertility they really
mean it.

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:17.594
Sometimes family
planning--contraception is not

00:57:17.594 --> 00:57:24.474
available and then people can
get into very desperate

00:57:24.474 --> 00:57:26.460
situations.
 

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:31.297
An American maternity nurse
went to Lusaka in Zambia and

00:57:31.297 --> 00:57:35.960
this is the University teaching
hospital in Zambia.

00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.597
So, most of these developed
countries will have a capital

00:57:38.597 --> 00:57:41.282
city and they have one high
class hospital that'll usually

00:57:41.282 --> 00:57:44.063
be attached to a university and
that's demanded by the upper

00:57:44.063 --> 00:57:46.655
class of that country,
the political elite,

00:57:46.655 --> 00:57:50.269
the economical elite demand
good modern medical services,

00:57:50.269 --> 00:57:52.309
it'll be one hospital there.
 

00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:55.746
You can look at the public
health budget for these

00:57:55.746 --> 00:57:59.184
countries and a very
disproportionate amount of it

00:57:59.184 --> 00:58:01.500
will go to this one hospital.
 

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:05.373
This University teaching
hospital in Lusaka is the high

00:58:05.373 --> 00:58:07.309
level hospital in Zambia.
 

00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:09.719
This nurse went into the
maternity ward;

00:58:09.719 --> 00:58:14.005
she was a maternity nurse,
expecting to see a lot of women

00:58:14.005 --> 00:58:15.360
having children.
 

00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:18.280
Instead this is what--this is
her report.

00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:22.351
"Ten women with botched
abortions were lying on nine

00:58:22.351 --> 00:58:22.860
beds.
 

00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:26.248
Five others were sprawled on
the concrete floors of the

00:58:26.248 --> 00:58:26.940
hallways.
 

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.579
A few more were in the hall--on
the floor outside the entrance.

00:58:30.579 --> 00:58:33.730
There were no blankets or
covers.

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:37.639
Most wait 12 hours for
treatment from a physician.

00:58:37.639 --> 00:58:41.500
The 'average' woman ends up
overnight on the floor;

00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.539
she receives no food or water.
 

00:58:44.539 --> 00:58:48.137
The women were aborting on the
floors or on their way to the

00:58:48.137 --> 00:58:50.820
single toilet at the end of the
long hall;

00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:54.132
30% of the patients complete
their abortions on the concrete

00:58:54.132 --> 00:58:55.760
floor with no medical care.
 

00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.820
All we can do is clean it
up."

00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:02.222
That's what the head nurse
there said, that all we can do

00:59:02.222 --> 00:59:03.559
is clean it up.
 

00:59:03.559 --> 00:59:05.599
This is not isolated to this
one hospital.

00:59:05.599 --> 00:59:10.364
You can go anywhere in the
underdeveloped world and at

00:59:10.364 --> 00:59:16.030
least half the beds in maternity
wards are taken up with botched

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:17.289
abortions.
 

00:59:17.289 --> 00:59:19.159
What goes on is,
in most of Africa,

00:59:19.159 --> 00:59:22.280
and a lot of the world,
abortion is illegal,

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.795
so doctors can't do it,
so they go to what they call

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:28.547
bush doctors,
some very poorly trained

00:59:28.547 --> 00:59:31.909
midwife or someone who just says
they'll do it,

00:59:31.909 --> 00:59:36.750
and they have this operation
and usually something is put up,

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:40.804
a stick or coat hanger or
something up the uterus and they

00:59:40.804 --> 00:59:42.940
try to scrape out the fetus.
 

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:45.608
But, in fact,
they often puncture the uterus

00:59:45.608 --> 00:59:49.268
which allows infection to get
into the main body cavity,

00:59:49.268 --> 00:59:53.235
and then after a few days
they're getting very sick from

00:59:53.235 --> 00:59:57.418
the infection which is now
systemic because it's inside the

00:59:57.418 --> 00:59:59.702
body,
plus the wound doesn't heal

00:59:59.702 --> 01:00:02.945
because of the infection so
there's constant bleeding and

01:00:02.945 --> 01:00:04.219
they can bleed out.
 

01:00:04.219 --> 01:00:06.072
Huge death rates,
we're going to talk about

01:00:06.072 --> 01:00:08.456
abortion later and I'll give you
some of these numbers,

01:00:08.456 --> 01:00:09.559
but huge death rates.
 

01:00:09.559 --> 01:00:13.739
Important point for this course
is that probably all of these

01:00:13.739 --> 01:00:17.989
women know of someone else who
has died from one of these--

01:00:17.989 --> 01:00:24.039
shall we call them
unprofessional abortions.

01:00:24.039 --> 01:00:28.824
Yet, when they get pregnant,
their desire not to have that

01:00:28.824 --> 01:00:33.777
extra child is so strong that
they will themselves choose to

01:00:33.777 --> 01:00:40.369
undergo this very,
very serious operation with a

01:00:40.369 --> 01:00:44.710
very high threat of death.
 

01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:49.175
That's one of the things that
the Planned Parent Federation in

01:00:49.175 --> 01:00:53.860
its international efforts like
what you saw is trying to cure.

01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:58.599
They had one project to go to
Kenya to train local private

01:00:58.599 --> 01:01:03.340
doctors who somewhat escape the
law in family planning and

01:01:03.340 --> 01:01:05.170
abortion services.
 

01:01:05.170 --> 01:01:07.972
The local doctors had been
turning away abortion clients

01:01:07.972 --> 01:01:10.469
because they did not know where
to refer them,

01:01:10.469 --> 01:01:15.599
so that means they got some
unskilled practitioner.

01:01:15.599 --> 01:01:18.702
One physician told the project
director that he had turned away

01:01:18.702 --> 01:01:21.657
a young girl only to find her in
a hospital a few days later

01:01:21.657 --> 01:01:24.010
after she had procured an
illegal abortion.

01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:25.840
The girl died.
 

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.413
The private doctor said that he
had since then lived with a

01:01:28.413 --> 01:01:29.389
great deal of guilt.
 

01:01:29.389 --> 01:01:33.409
He is happy now that he can
provide treatment using a very

01:01:33.409 --> 01:01:34.610
safe procedure.
 

01:01:34.610 --> 01:01:39.702
In between that they've
legalized things to some degree

01:01:39.702 --> 01:01:40.739
in Kenya.
 

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:43.960
It's not only the third world
in which this takes place.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:48.739
In Bulgaria,
sometime back under the Soviet

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:54.090
system, 57% of pregnancies ended
in abortion.

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:56.260
You'll hear during the abortion
lecture in the United States,

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:59.659
there's one abortion for every
three live births,

01:01:59.659 --> 01:02:03.818
and something like 40 to 50
million abortions worldwide and

01:02:03.818 --> 01:02:08.409
about half of these are illegal
and illegal means very unsafe.

01:02:08.409 --> 01:02:11.434
A woman dies,
it's about every three minutes

01:02:11.434 --> 01:02:14.880
from a botched--one of these
illegal abortions.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.856
I think with these stories and
the large numbers that are

01:02:17.856 --> 01:02:20.246
attached to them,
I mean any woman in that

01:02:20.246 --> 01:02:24.853
situation that has an abortion,
she does not want that child

01:02:24.853 --> 01:02:30.519
and when you say there's 50
million of them worldwide that

01:02:30.519 --> 01:02:35.887
means that the demand for
control of fertility is very,

01:02:35.887 --> 01:02:37.380
very high.
 

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:40.949
You'll read the Brazilian
solution to this which is a

01:02:40.949 --> 01:02:42.940
modern form of infanticide.
 

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:45.114
I don't know if you read yet,
the Death Without

01:02:45.114 --> 01:02:48.494
Weeping,
it's in your reading packet

01:02:48.494 --> 01:02:54.728
where mothers who know that they
can't raise a child just leave

01:02:54.728 --> 01:03:00.659
the child to die and they say
that 'God can take better care

01:03:00.659 --> 01:03:06.190
of it then I can' and they just
let the child die.

01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:11.579
This is not to say that--So,
what has happened in the world

01:03:11.579 --> 01:03:17.342
is that fertility has come down
drastically and I've showed you

01:03:17.342 --> 01:03:23.289
that in previous graphs where
the fertility is coming down,

01:03:23.289 --> 01:03:28.579
and in the peak period in
Bolivia during the peak--

01:03:28.579 --> 01:03:33.311
the number doubled from about
12% to 25% of people using a

01:03:33.311 --> 01:03:34.639
modern method.
 

01:03:34.639 --> 01:03:38.929
Ecuador, 50% of the women are
using a modern mechanism.

01:03:38.929 --> 01:03:44.639
Tunisia, 60% and Iran is one of
the really interesting cases.

01:03:44.639 --> 01:03:48.592
Iran had this very conservative
government and they were against

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:52.295
family planning and all this,
and then they had the war with

01:03:52.295 --> 01:03:52.860
Iraq.
 

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.172
Iraq invaded,
with U.S.

01:03:54.172 --> 01:03:56.619
help, and huge numbers of
people died,

01:03:56.619 --> 01:04:00.001
including a lot of kids,
so afterwards their young

01:04:00.001 --> 01:04:03.039
people were depleted but once
those kids--

01:04:03.039 --> 01:04:04.780
they recovered a little bit
from that,

01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:08.563
the government realized what
was happening and decided on a

01:04:08.563 --> 01:04:10.260
family planning program.
 

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:15.239
This is an Iranian woman
packing condoms.

01:04:15.239 --> 01:04:19.086
We have this image of places
like Iran as being so backwards

01:04:19.086 --> 01:04:22.139
and conservative and everything,
but they have,

01:04:22.139 --> 01:04:25.389
in fact, now one of the best
family planning programs in the

01:04:25.389 --> 01:04:27.972
world,
and the UN a few years ago

01:04:27.972 --> 01:04:32.635
awarded it their top--
best program in the world and

01:04:32.635 --> 01:04:37.579
their fertility rate is now at
replacement level.

01:04:37.579 --> 01:04:42.643
Fertility is coming down almost
everywhere, with again

01:04:42.643 --> 01:04:48.472
Sub-Saharan Africa and some of
the Arab countries as a counter

01:04:48.472 --> 01:04:49.619
example.
 

01:04:49.619 --> 01:04:52.150
Birth rates not only--Birth
rates fell;

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:56.893
Thailand 50% in 12 years;
Columbia 40% in 14 years,

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.679
this is at the peak.
 

01:04:58.679 --> 01:05:03.280
Indonesia 48% in 20 years;
Morocco 31% in 12 years;

01:05:03.280 --> 01:05:07.179
Turkey 21% in ten years;
Brazil 60% in 25 years;

01:05:07.179 --> 01:05:11.829
Mexico 30% in just six years;
Botswana 26%;

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:14.992
Zimbabwe 18%;
Kenya 35%, I mean everywhere

01:05:14.992 --> 01:05:18.469
that you look the actual
fertility is coming down,

01:05:18.469 --> 01:05:23.552
so people are using
contraception and using it

01:05:23.552 --> 01:05:29.766
efficiently and the world birth
rate has come down quite

01:05:29.766 --> 01:05:31.800
significantly.
 

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:36.829
None of this is to minimize
that people in developing

01:05:36.829 --> 01:05:42.313
countries are caught in a bind,
that you all have heard all

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:47.269
kinds of reasons why they might
want to have a lot of children

01:05:47.269 --> 01:05:49.789
and one is extra farm labor.
 

01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:52.768
One is support for children in
old age, a major kind of

01:05:52.768 --> 01:05:53.320
problem.
 

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:56.320
One their religion might demand
it.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.436
Two cultural reasons,
various ancestor worship

01:05:59.436 --> 01:06:00.130
reasons.
 

01:06:00.130 --> 01:06:04.193
In India you have to have a son
to light the funeral pyre,

01:06:04.193 --> 01:06:07.829
no son you don't go into the
afterworld properly.

01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:10.320
We discussed some of this with
respect to Africa.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.559
Status reasons,
you have more children you have

01:06:13.559 --> 01:06:16.940
more prestige for both the man
and the woman,

01:06:16.940 --> 01:06:21.992
there's macho reasons to prove
your fertility and the list goes

01:06:21.992 --> 01:06:22.969
on and on.
 

01:06:22.969 --> 01:06:27.128
The reasons they may not use
birth control are many,

01:06:27.128 --> 01:06:32.429
one of which is family planning
services can be very primitive.

01:06:32.429 --> 01:06:35.766
It's not a great slide but it's
an old bus in India with a red

01:06:35.766 --> 01:06:38.884
cross on it and this is the
family planning clinic in this

01:06:38.884 --> 01:06:40.579
part of India at that time.
 

01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:43.228
People were supposed to go on
this bus and have some operation

01:06:43.228 --> 01:06:45.139
that they didn't understand done
to them,

01:06:45.139 --> 01:06:48.400
sterilization or IUD insertion
or something,

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:55.094
and you know you wouldn't be
exactly very anxious to get on

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:56.710
to that bus.
 

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:03.451
Another thing that I mentioned
last time with respect to

01:07:03.451 --> 01:07:07.309
Veena's lecture,
that the worry about medical

01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:10.697
complications is one of the most
major reasons why women either

01:07:10.697 --> 01:07:14.699
don't use contraception at all,
or start it and then stop using

01:07:14.699 --> 01:07:14.969
it.
 

01:07:14.969 --> 01:07:18.027
What does this mean in a
pre-medical country where they

01:07:18.027 --> 01:07:20.349
don't have really modern medical
ideas.

01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:22.539
You take the pill,
you're scared of it.

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:25.621
Anything that happens to you,
you get a tummy ache,

01:07:25.621 --> 01:07:29.072
you fall and break your leg,
anything that happens to you

01:07:29.072 --> 01:07:30.429
what do you blame?
 

01:07:30.429 --> 01:07:31.820
You blame the pill.
 

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.840
So here is a culture without
much medicine,

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:36.829
a low standard of living;
they're getting sick a lot.

01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:40.262
People in developing countries
are not generally very healthy

01:07:40.262 --> 01:07:43.809
and they get sick and they don't
know what it was caused by.

01:07:43.809 --> 01:07:46.099
You probably read already about
The Evil Eye.

01:07:46.099 --> 01:07:49.050
Did you read the Egyptian--the
Kul Khaal yet?

01:07:49.050 --> 01:07:50.710
The Evil Eye is the reason.
 

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:53.434
If you've taken the pill you
know that's changing your body

01:07:53.434 --> 01:07:55.353
in some way,
and you're afraid of it,

01:07:55.353 --> 01:07:58.577
you get sick with anything,
it's the pill was the reason

01:07:58.577 --> 01:08:02.278
for it and then you tell all
your friends that and everybody

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:05.918
in the community learns that
such and such got some problem

01:08:05.918 --> 01:08:09.496
because of the pill so they're
very much afraid to use the

01:08:09.496 --> 01:08:10.250
pill.
 

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:16.698
On an on, there's a big
conflict, big contestation,

01:08:16.698 --> 01:08:21.010
the media, I think this is in
Morocco,

01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:27.288
this is a cave,
this is the desert around here,

01:08:27.288 --> 01:08:29.979
they're in a cave and what
they're watching is a TV show.

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:34.194
I was in Morocco in the far
desert and you see these little

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:38.192
villages of just a few mud
houses and they all had solar

01:08:38.192 --> 01:08:41.100
arrays and they all had
television,

01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.319
so media is passing on very
strongly.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:47.631
On the other side of the
equation is all kinds of reasons

01:08:47.631 --> 01:08:50.470
that they don't use it or that
they do use it.

01:08:50.470 --> 01:08:53.050
It's a very much in
contestation.

01:08:53.050 --> 01:08:57.760
In the West,
especially activists,

01:08:57.760 --> 01:09:00.827
liberal people,
people in the Forestry School

01:09:00.827 --> 01:09:04.801
believe that we shouldn't
support family planning programs

01:09:04.801 --> 01:09:07.658
because it's politically
contentious.

01:09:07.658 --> 01:09:09.310
Why is it politically
contentious?

01:09:09.310 --> 01:09:12.109
Because people on the right are
opposed to it for religious or

01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:14.170
moral reasons,
people on the more or less

01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:16.435
left, and these are
characterizations right and

01:09:16.435 --> 01:09:16.829
left.
 

01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:20.407
We can't impose;
we 'great white Westerners'

01:09:20.407 --> 01:09:24.355
can't impose our values on our
'poor little yellow and brown

01:09:24.355 --> 01:09:25.158
cousins'.
 

01:09:25.158 --> 01:09:29.002
It's utter nonsense and it's
patronizing because the people

01:09:29.002 --> 01:09:32.846
in these developing countries
have spoken very clearly when

01:09:32.846 --> 01:09:35.828
they add up all these pluses and
minuses.

01:09:35.828 --> 01:09:39.948
That's their choice,
and as I've showed data--

01:09:39.948 --> 01:09:43.201
I've hit you over the head with
data showing you that when

01:09:43.201 --> 01:09:46.338
people in the developing
countries themselves add up the

01:09:46.338 --> 01:09:48.961
data,
they want to be protected by

01:09:48.961 --> 01:09:50.060
contraception.
 

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:51.903
I think that we,
in the West,

01:09:51.903 --> 01:09:54.340
ought to take that very
seriously,

01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.479
and starting with intellectuals
who should know better,

01:09:57.479 --> 01:10:00.948
but since people don't give
courses like this and people--

01:10:00.948 --> 01:10:03.828
even environmentalists and all
kinds of others,

01:10:03.828 --> 01:10:07.443
just don't pay any attention to
human population because it's

01:10:07.443 --> 01:10:09.010
politically untouchable.
 

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:12.193
The major organizations,
the environmental organizations

01:10:12.193 --> 01:10:15.434
won't touch it because they do
fundraising and the public

01:10:15.434 --> 01:10:19.429
opinion is that--
it's a horrible thing to push

01:10:19.429 --> 01:10:23.359
family planning on developing
countries.

01:10:23.359 --> 01:10:32.020
I guess that is where we will
end today.

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:35.359
See you--yes one more this week
before vacation.

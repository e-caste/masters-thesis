00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.250
Prof: Turn to the
beginning of the Gospel of Luke.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.430
We're going to go through a lot
of Luke and Acts today.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.030
Today I'll--I sort of lied on
the syllabus.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.730
You know how untrustworthy I am
by now.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.774
I said on the syllabus that
we're going to talk about Luke

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:28.180
today and have a lecture on Acts
on Wednesday.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.498
That's not quite true because
you can't really talk about Luke

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:34.762
without also talking about Acts
and you can't much talk about

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:38.080
Acts without talking about Luke
because they're written by the

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.060
same person.
 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.678
Almost no scholar doubts that
they're written by the same

00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:43.260
person.
 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.899
There are some scholars who
actually argue that you

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.750
shouldn't read them as two
volumes of the same work.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.081
Some people even say they think
Acts was written a good bit

00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:55.275
after the Gospel of Luke,
but I'm going to treat them as

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:57.390
basically two volumes of the
same work.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.719
Part of the lecture today will
focus on Acts,

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.619
but a whole lot of the lecture
will also focus on--

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:06.599
I mean part of Luke but also on
Acts,

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.694
and then next time,
also, though talking about Acts

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.860
I'll go back and talk about
Luke.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.610
Did everyone get a handout of
the outline of Luke and Acts?

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.447
If anybody doesn't--didn't get
a handout hold up your hands and

00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:22.730
we'll get the teaching fellows
to hand them around.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.700
Look at the beginning of Luke.
 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.229
"Since many have
undertaken to set down an

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.813
orderly account--
" now what will

00:01:32.813 --> 00:01:35.730
"orderly account"
mean?

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.050
"--of the events that have
been fulfilled among us,

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.337
just as they were handed onto
us by those who were from the

00:01:43.337 --> 00:01:47.480
beginning eyewitnesses and
servants of the word."

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.640
When he tells you that he's
gotten some things from--

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.763
handed down,
traditions, accounts from

00:01:54.763 --> 00:01:59.828
eyewitnesses what's the first
thing that that tells you about

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.180
this author?
 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.640
He's not an eyewitness,
precisely.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.015
I, too, decided,
after investigating everything

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:10.091
carefully from the very first,
to write an orderly account

00:02:10.091 --> 00:02:12.199
[there again]
for you,

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:15.674
most excellent Theopholis,
so that you may know the truth

00:02:15.674 --> 00:02:19.460
concerning the things about
which you have been instructed.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.651
There are several things that
this prologue to the Gospel of

00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:24.788
Luke tells us.
 

00:02:24.788 --> 00:02:26.849
One of the things of course,
as you just noticed,

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.740
it's not written by someone who
was there.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.090
Some people will say that when
we get to Acts,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.797
at least part of Acts seems to
have been written by a person

00:02:34.797 --> 00:02:37.202
who was actually there,
because about halfway through

00:02:37.202 --> 00:02:39.250
the book of Acts he starts about
"we."

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.395
We did this,
and we did this,

00:02:40.395 --> 00:02:42.849
rather than just Paul or other
people in the third person.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.348
I don't believe that's the case.
 

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:48.806
I believe he may have used some
kind of written document that

00:02:48.806 --> 00:02:50.182
was--
that used the term

00:02:50.182 --> 00:02:52.669
"we"
or sometimes an ancient text,

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.599
I think sometimes a person
would just insert themselves

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.240
into the narrative to give it a
more directness.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.217
So I'm not going to teach that
this author was an eyewitness of

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.848
any of the stuff that he writes
about,

00:03:06.848 --> 00:03:08.949
but certainly he's not an
eyewitness of the stuff that

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:11.090
happens in the Gospels,
as he also says.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.938
That's one thing that it tells
us.

00:03:12.938 --> 00:03:16.580
This also tells us that this is
a compilation of sources.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.800
Now already,
when you've been working on the

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.639
synoptic problem and how to
write an exegesis paper,

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.473
you have figured out that the
Gospel writers used other

00:03:24.473 --> 00:03:25.000
sources.
 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.931
Some of them are written
sources, some of them are oral

00:03:26.931 --> 00:03:27.288
sources.
 

00:03:27.288 --> 00:03:30.272
This guy actually admits it up
front, so it sounds like he's

00:03:30.272 --> 00:03:32.598
using both written sources and
oral sources.

00:03:32.598 --> 00:03:35.318
What's one of the written
sources we know he used?

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:37.822
Mark, exactly,
and we think that there's

00:03:37.822 --> 00:03:41.800
another written source that we
call Q that he may have used.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.460
What does he mean by
"orderly account"?

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.866
Does it mean that Mark kind of
wrote things in one order and

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:50.351
this guy knows a better
chronological order,

00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.680
a historical order?
 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.234
Is he talking about,
I'm writing to you an account

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:57.310
that's more like what actually
happened when it happened?

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.824
That's the way this has
sometimes been interpreted by

00:03:59.824 --> 00:04:00.258
people.
 

00:04:00.258 --> 00:04:03.924
As we'll see today that's not
likely right because we can even

00:04:03.924 --> 00:04:06.926
tell when this author is
creatively shifting events

00:04:06.926 --> 00:04:08.848
around for his own purposes.
 

00:04:08.848 --> 00:04:11.990
He's claiming to write an
orderly account,

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.496
but if he is claiming that he's
giving us a more chronologically

00:04:15.496 --> 00:04:17.500
accurate account then he's
wrong,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.870
as we'll see.
 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.954
Probably he doesn't even mean
that, probably this is no claim

00:04:21.954 --> 00:04:22.829
to historicity.
 

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:26.014
He's probably just saying that,
the way I tell this is better

00:04:26.014 --> 00:04:29.199
than the way that Mark or Q or
some other sources tell it.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.052
He's thought about the order in
which he puts it and he's

00:04:32.052 --> 00:04:34.550
thought about how he wants to
write his Gospel.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.920
This also tells you what
literary form this is.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.298
He knows he's writing something
that's like other literature in

00:04:41.298 --> 00:04:42.389
the ancient world.
 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.670
The Gospel of Luke is not a
biography but it could have been

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.339
thought of as a life.
 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:53.745
In fact, the Greek word for
life is bios,

00:04:53.745 --> 00:04:56.389
where we get biology.
 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:02.439
Bios could be the name
of genre of literature that told

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.720
about some great man.
 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.226
We separate it from biography
because it doesn't have the same

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:09.199
kind of concerns that a modern
biography does.

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.002
It seems like he knows that for
the Gospel of Luke anyway he's

00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:16.120
writing a bios of Jesus,
a life of Jesus.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.339
How do we know that?
 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.877
Because he starts off later in
the Gospel with the same kind of

00:05:20.877 --> 00:05:24.358
stuff that you would see if you
read a book about Augustus the

00:05:24.358 --> 00:05:28.120
Emperor,
or Plato the great philosopher.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.557
That is, he starts off with
narratives about a miraculous

00:05:31.557 --> 00:05:32.050
birth.
 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:36.146
Telling stories about a great
man and his miraculous birth was

00:05:36.146 --> 00:05:39.370
a not uncommon way to start a
life of someone.

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.182
Then in Acts it also looks like
he knows he's writing something

00:05:42.182 --> 00:05:44.180
that would look something like a
history,

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.269
and we have histories also from
the ancient world.

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:50.560
This guy is--much more then
Mark, this author is much more

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.791
self conscious in setting
himself forward and setting his

00:05:53.791 --> 00:05:56.879
work up as a literary work,
it has literary form.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:58.440
Who is Theophilus though?
 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.216
Some people would think,
well maybe this is the guy's

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:03.071
patron,
because often in the ancient

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:06.139
world when you wrote a book you
started off with the dedication.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:08.062
The dedication,
you didn't say,

00:06:08.062 --> 00:06:10.968
dedicated to so and so,
what you said was Dear

00:06:10.968 --> 00:06:14.293
Theophilus, I am writing this
because you've asked me to set

00:06:14.293 --> 00:06:15.420
down my thoughts.
 

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.810
In other words you give a
fiction,

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.370
it's a fiction that your
patron, maybe the person who

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.110
supports you financially or
socially,

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:26.913
or whatever that person has
asked you to set down an account

00:06:26.913 --> 00:06:27.879
of something.
 

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:31.120
You would start off,
Dear Mr. Smith you've asked

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.360
me repeatedly when we had lunch
at Mori's,

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.730
to describe my recent trip to
Africa,

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.769
so I'm writing this down at
your request.

00:06:38.769 --> 00:06:40.550
That's a dedication to your
patron.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.779
Who is Theophilus, though?
 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:45.649
Some people say maybe he's an
actual historic person,

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:47.723
he calls him "most
excellent,"

00:06:47.723 --> 00:06:50.911
the Greek word would seem to
imply that this guy is of fairly

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.995
high class or that our author
wants us to believe that he's

00:06:53.995 --> 00:06:54.899
high class.
 

00:06:54.899 --> 00:06:57.387
It's also, though,
possible, some people have

00:06:57.387 --> 00:06:59.634
said,
maybe he's a fiction because

00:06:59.634 --> 00:07:03.673
Theophilus comes from two Greek
words meaning theos which

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:06.447
is God,
and philos beloved or

00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:07.040
friend.
 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.903
Some people have said he's
making up a name that's sort of

00:07:10.903 --> 00:07:15.040
a fictive name for any God
loving or beloved by God reader.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.021
We really don't know,
so scholars are completely at

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:21.420
sea as far is if Theophilus a
real person or is he not.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.569
Those are several things about
that we need to notice.

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:29.939
He sets himself up as writing a
history by the ancient standards

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:34.100
of history, but is it history by
our standards of history?

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.226
The only way to figure that out
is to analyze the text itself,

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:39.019
so that's what we're going to
do.

00:07:39.019 --> 00:07:42.935
On your outline you have--on
your handout you have an outline

00:07:42.935 --> 00:07:45.089
of Luke and an outline of Acts.
 

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:47.809
I think I didn't get one,
I gave mine away,

00:07:47.809 --> 00:07:48.910
can I have one?
 

00:07:52.509 --> 00:07:56.949
Thank you, Michael.
 

00:07:56.949 --> 00:07:59.050
Notice how it's divided up.
 

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:04.305
First you get the beginning of
the Gospel which actually starts

00:08:04.305 --> 00:08:08.290
off with the birth and childhood
narratives,

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:11.259
and Jesus and John the Baptist,
in chapter 1,

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:13.759
and then in chapter 3 you get
Jesus meeting--

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:16.250
Jesus relationship to John the
Baptist.

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:19.932
All of this starts off partly
in Galilee but also partly in

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:20.439
Judea.
 

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.764
The birth of John happens in
Judea, the birth of Jesus,

00:08:22.764 --> 00:08:24.875
according to Luke,
happens in Galilee [correction:

00:08:24.875 --> 00:08:25.350
Judea].
 

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:28.208
Luke also, though,
has Jesus family go from Judea

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:30.887
to Galilee [correction:
from Galilee to Judea]

00:08:30.887 --> 00:08:31.959
for the birth.
 

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:34.633
Now that's different from
Matthew, Matthew just started

00:08:34.633 --> 00:08:36.960
off with the holy family living
in Bethlehem.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:41.399
Luke has the idea that this
family is living in Galilee and,

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:45.235
because of a census,
the family is required to go to

00:08:45.235 --> 00:08:47.720
Bethlehem, which is in Judea.
 

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.206
The family is from Galilee,
but Luke really starts the

00:08:51.206 --> 00:08:54.628
action of his Gospel,
both for John the Baptist birth

00:08:54.628 --> 00:08:57.259
and for the birth of Jesus in
Judea.

00:08:57.259 --> 00:08:58.178
That's going to be important.
 

00:08:58.178 --> 00:09:00.929
Then you have,
starting in 3:23,

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:05.720
the beginning of Jesus'
Galilean ministry and that goes

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.850
all the way to 9:50.
 

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:09.250
You have the beginning of the
ministry,

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.710
there's an announcement in
3:23, this is Jesus began to--

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.480
in the fifteenth year of reign
of Tiberius,

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.634
then you have a genealogy,
then you have the temptation

00:09:17.634 --> 00:09:20.676
story in chapter 4,
and then you have Jesus'

00:09:20.676 --> 00:09:23.869
inaugural address,
which we'll talk about both

00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:25.470
this time and next time.
 

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.298
In 4:14-30 is Jesus' first
sermon, it's very clear Luke

00:09:29.298 --> 00:09:33.341
wants to set this up as Jesus'
first sermon and we'll talk

00:09:33.341 --> 00:09:34.759
about why later.
 

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:41.158
Then you have 4:31 to 8:56,
the Galilean ministry proper.

00:09:41.158 --> 00:09:43.765
That is, this is Jesus going
around Galilee,

00:09:43.765 --> 00:09:46.070
healing people,
preaching, teaching.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.225
Now look in chapter 9,
though, then you get a

00:09:49.225 --> 00:09:50.659
transition period.
 

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.384
Most of chapter 9 is a
transition from the Galilee

00:09:58.384 --> 00:10:01.778
ministry to the other main part
of Jesus'--

00:10:01.778 --> 00:10:07.481
of Luke's passage in the Gospel
which is Jesus' trip to

00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:08.750
Jerusalem.
 

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.240
9:1, "Then Jesus called
the twelve together and gave

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.090
them power and authority over
demons and cured diseases."

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:17.023
Notice now, he's not really
doing the Galilean ministry

00:10:17.023 --> 00:10:19.740
anymore, he's setting up other
things to happen.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:30.741
Look at--now look all the way
at the end of that chapter at

00:10:30.741 --> 00:10:32.070
9:51.
 

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.014
This is a very big verse in
Luke although--but you'd never

00:10:35.014 --> 00:10:38.269
know it unless you had a scholar
kind of point it out to you;

00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:42.231
9:51: "When the days drew
near for him to be taken up,

00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:45.169
he set his face to go to
Jerusalem."

00:10:45.169 --> 00:10:46.769
Now what is that?
 

00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:49.590
"Taken up,"
--does that refer to Jesus

00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:51.029
ascension into heaven?
 

00:10:51.029 --> 00:10:53.985
Is it for his crucifixion
because you put somebody up on a

00:10:53.985 --> 00:10:54.399
cross?
 

00:10:54.399 --> 00:10:56.317
Whatever it is,
but notice, we're not even

00:10:56.317 --> 00:10:58.048
toward the end of the Gospel
here,

00:10:58.048 --> 00:11:00.032
we're only about halfway
through--we're not even halfway

00:11:00.032 --> 00:11:00.788
through the Gospel.
 

00:11:00.788 --> 00:11:04.120
We're at still very early in
the Gospel compared to what the

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.912
rest of it is,
and yet, what Luke is doing is

00:11:06.912 --> 00:11:10.149
turning your attention as a
reader now to Jerusalem.

00:11:10.149 --> 00:11:13.330
"When the days drew near
for him to be taken up,

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.058
he set his face to go to
Jerusalem,

00:11:15.058 --> 00:11:17.188
he sent messengers ahead of
him," and they go through

00:11:17.188 --> 00:11:17.750
the villages.
 

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.100
So all the rest of the next ten
chapters Jesus is on the road.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.399
"On the road again."
 

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:25.509
It's on the road to Jerusalem.
 

00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:29.562
Now this big ten chapter on the
road trip, Jesus' road trip to

00:11:29.562 --> 00:11:32.486
Jerusalem, is not found in the
other Gospels,

00:11:32.486 --> 00:11:33.950
it's only in Luke.
 

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.548
What does--what is it there for?
 

00:11:36.548 --> 00:11:39.696
Then in 19:45,
Jesus finally gets to

00:11:39.696 --> 00:11:45.181
Jerusalem, and from 19:45 until
the end of Luke you have Jesus

00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:46.710
in Jerusalem.
 

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.956
Then Acts starts out,
and as I've said before,

00:11:49.956 --> 00:11:54.429
the next volume Acts starts by
retelling a bit of what happened

00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:56.090
at the end of Luke.
 

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.416
You know you're in the second
volume of a two volume work here

00:11:59.416 --> 00:12:01.980
because he rehashes at the
beginning of Acts.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:06.298
First you get the time--from
one, Acts 1:1 to 9:43,

00:12:06.298 --> 00:12:10.620
I've designated as the time
before the Gentiles.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:13.379
The church is all a Jewish
community,

00:12:13.379 --> 00:12:16.610
they all live mainly in Judea
and Jerusalem,

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.552
they worship together,
they even spend a lot of time

00:12:18.552 --> 00:12:19.889
in the temple,
in the Jewish temple.

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:22.519
This is very much a Jewish
organization,

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:24.620
the Gentiles haven't been
brought in,

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.105
and then you have another
transition period just like when

00:12:27.105 --> 00:12:29.330
we had a transition period in
Chapter 9 of Luke,

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:34.173
in Chapter 10 of Acts you have
a transition period from 10:1 to

00:12:34.173 --> 00:12:34.798
12:25.
 

00:12:34.798 --> 00:12:38.710
First you have the conversion
of the first Gentile convert,

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:42.327
he's a Roman Centurion,
Cornelius, and you have Peter

00:12:42.327 --> 00:12:45.178
defending his conversion of
Cornelius,

00:12:45.178 --> 00:12:47.782
because this is controversial
to bring someone into the church

00:12:47.782 --> 00:12:49.830
without them being circumcised
at this point,

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.308
according to Luke's narrative.
 

00:12:51.308 --> 00:12:58.469
Then you have 11:19-30,
look at that,

00:12:58.469 --> 00:13:03.370
Acts 11:19-30:
Now those who were scattered,

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:06.258
because of the persecution that
took place over Stephen,

00:13:06.258 --> 00:13:09.038
traveled as far as Phoenicia,
Cyprus, and Antioch.

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:10.460
And they spoke the word to no
one but Jews.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:13.798
But among them were some men
from Cyprus and Cyrene who on

00:13:13.798 --> 00:13:16.493
coming to Antioch spoke to the
Hellenists also,

00:13:16.493 --> 00:13:18.308
proclaiming the Lord Jesus.
 

00:13:18.308 --> 00:13:20.553
Now you may have a footnote
after the word

00:13:20.553 --> 00:13:23.400
"Hellenists,"
does anybody have a food note

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.809
after the word Hellenist there
in your--

00:13:25.809 --> 00:13:27.259
what does your footnote say?
 

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:29.330
Student: 
&gt;

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.346
Prof: Greeks,
so some texts have

00:13:31.346 --> 00:13:33.894
"Hellenists"
which would be sort of Greek

00:13:33.894 --> 00:13:36.596
speaking Jews and other
manuscripts have just the word

00:13:36.596 --> 00:13:37.820
"Greeks."
 

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.817
In fact, you can even take this
term "Hellenist"

00:13:40.817 --> 00:13:42.450
to be just Greeks themselves.
 

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:45.293
At least there's some idea that
these people were speaking not

00:13:45.293 --> 00:13:48.090
just too Greek--speaking to
Greek Jews but also to Greeks.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.751
That introduces,
then, this period of the

00:13:51.751 --> 00:13:52.759
Gentiles.
 

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:56.936
You have the introduction to a
predominantly Gentile church in

00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:59.476
Antioch,
and that's what you get from

00:13:59.476 --> 00:14:01.831
11:19-30,
and then you get some

00:14:01.831 --> 00:14:05.058
persecution in Jerusalem in
Chapter 12,

00:14:05.058 --> 00:14:10.456
and then you get a shift of
attention from Jerusalem to the

00:14:10.456 --> 00:14:14.009
Gentiles in 12:25:
But the word of God continued

00:14:14.009 --> 00:14:15.720
to advance and gain adherence.
 

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.018
Then after completing their
mission, Barnabus and Saul

00:14:18.018 --> 00:14:20.099
returned to Jerusalem and
brought with them John,

00:14:20.099 --> 00:14:21.399
whose other name was Mark.
 

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:23.327
I actually think that's
supposed to be "returned

00:14:23.327 --> 00:14:24.590
from Jerusalem to Antioch."
 

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:28.456
There's again some manuscript
problems because in 13:1 you

00:14:28.456 --> 00:14:29.996
have,
"Now in the church at

00:14:29.996 --> 00:14:31.840
Antioch there were prophets and
teachers."

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.077
From chapter 13 to the rest of
Acts, the attention is not in

00:14:36.077 --> 00:14:36.940
Jerusalem.
 

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:39.163
They go back to Jerusalem,
Paul goes back to Jerusalem a

00:14:39.163 --> 00:14:40.846
few times,
and Paul is eventually arrested

00:14:40.846 --> 00:14:42.190
in Jerusalem and there is a
trial,

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:43.779
and there's all kinds of
interesting,

00:14:43.779 --> 00:14:46.580
exciting riots and things that
happen in Jerusalem.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:50.128
But the rest of Acts the
attention is away from Jerusalem

00:14:50.128 --> 00:14:54.120
and to the rest of the world,
the rest of--all the way there.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.307
Then you have from 13:1 you
have the period called

00:14:56.307 --> 00:14:58.898
"after the Gentiles,"
this is after Gentiles have

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:01.754
been brought into the church and
then the focus is going to be on

00:15:01.754 --> 00:15:03.808
the Gentile church for the rest
of Acts.

00:15:03.808 --> 00:15:06.272
You get, for example,
the first missionary journey of

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:08.827
Paul, then you have the
Jerusalem conference in chapter

00:15:08.827 --> 00:15:10.769
15, which we've talked about
already.

00:15:10.769 --> 00:15:13.450
Then you have the second
missionary journey of Paul,

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:15.538
and then the third missionary
journey of Paul,

00:15:15.538 --> 00:15:19.375
and then you have Paul in
Jerusalem and then arrested and

00:15:19.375 --> 00:15:22.333
taken to Rome,
and then you have Paul in Rome

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:26.490
and ending the whole book,
chapter 28:17-31.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:28.629
Notice what's going on here.
 

00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:33.950
Luke constructs his two-volume
work like this.

00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:44.980
It starts off in Judea,
it keeps coming to Jerusalem,

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.870
Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
it focuses you on Jerusalem,

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.118
through all the Gospel of Luke,
and then the last week of

00:15:50.118 --> 00:15:52.960
Jesus' life in Jerusalem where
he's crucified,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.110
he's resurrected.
 

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:59.192
Where did Jesus appear to his
disciples after his resurrection

00:15:59.192 --> 00:16:01.110
according to Matthew?
 

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.700
Galilee, exactly.
 

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:07.361
Did Jesus appear to any of his
disciples in Jerusalem according

00:16:07.361 --> 00:16:08.129
to Matthew?
 

00:16:08.129 --> 00:16:10.240
No.
 

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.104
All the appearances of
Jesus--the resurrected Jesus in

00:16:13.104 --> 00:16:15.590
Matthew take place in Galilee
not Jerusalem.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:20.304
Just the opposite of that,
at the end of Luke and the

00:16:20.304 --> 00:16:23.759
beginning of Acts,
Jesus tells his disciples after

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:25.640
he's risen,
several of them see him,

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:28.187
and he says,
"Stay in Jerusalem,

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:32.376
don't go out of Jerusalem or
Judea until the Holy Spirit

00:16:32.376 --> 00:16:33.519
comes."
 

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:36.065
And it says,
they stayed in Jerusalem the

00:16:36.065 --> 00:16:40.138
whole--he--Jesus appeared to his
disciples for a stated period of

00:16:40.138 --> 00:16:43.590
time, according to Acts;
I think its forty days.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:44.929
Is that right?
 

00:16:44.929 --> 00:16:46.408
Something like that.
 

00:16:46.408 --> 00:16:49.575
After that period of time Jesus
no longer appeared to his

00:16:49.575 --> 00:16:51.192
disciples,
according to Acts,

00:16:51.192 --> 00:16:54.063
he ascended into heaven,
but that whole time they stayed

00:16:54.063 --> 00:16:56.120
in Judea,
so all the appearances of the

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.312
resurrected Jesus,
according to Luke,

00:16:58.312 --> 00:16:59.928
take place in Jerusalem.
 

00:16:59.928 --> 00:17:02.740
That's interesting see that he
starts off in Galilee,

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.166
he ends up in Jerusalem,
and then Acts starts off again

00:17:06.166 --> 00:17:08.769
in Jerusalem and then it goes
out and--

00:17:08.769 --> 00:17:12.640
to part of the world--it
expands its vision to Antioch,

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:16.940
to Asia Minor,
to Greece, to Europe,

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.250
and finally Paul ends up in
Rome at the end.

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.685
There's a very schematic
geographical system to the way

00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:28.220
Luke has organized this two
volume work,

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.454
and that's even reflected in
the layout of the outline of the

00:17:32.454 --> 00:17:34.150
book,
which is why I wanted to give

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.318
you that very simple outline.
 

00:17:35.318 --> 00:17:37.729
Now let's go back and see how
this is reflected in other

00:17:37.729 --> 00:17:38.078
parts.
 

00:17:38.078 --> 00:17:44.151
Look at Jesus' inaugural speech
as put forward by Luke in

00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:46.318
chapter 4 of Luke.
 

00:17:46.318 --> 00:17:49.648
Now we're going to spend a lot
of time talking about this

00:17:49.648 --> 00:17:53.335
because you're going to imitate
me when you write your exegesis

00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:53.990
papers.
 

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:57.773
You're going to pay really good
attention to all the details of

00:17:57.773 --> 00:17:58.690
the pericope.
 

00:17:58.690 --> 00:18:02.597
You've learned now that
pericope is just a fancy

00:18:02.597 --> 00:18:05.826
Greek word for section,
it's the Greek form of section,

00:18:05.826 --> 00:18:07.480
both of them mean something cut
out,

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.009
and so pericope is what we
biblical scholars often call a

00:18:11.009 --> 00:18:14.160
little piece of text that you do
an exegesis of.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.799
You want to concentrate on the
details of your pericope to try

00:18:17.799 --> 00:18:19.828
to find out what the message is.
 

00:18:19.828 --> 00:18:23.140
So that's what we're going to
do with this passage 4:16-30.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.088
Now it would help if you also
compared this--

00:18:26.088 --> 00:18:27.410
we're not going to do that so
much right now--

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:32.318
with Mark 6:1-6 because Luke is
getting this scene from Mark.

00:18:32.318 --> 00:18:35.790
What's going to be interesting
to us is, what does Luke change

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.838
about the scene he gets from
Mark?

00:18:37.838 --> 00:18:40.288
What does he add to the scene
he gets from Mark?

00:18:40.288 --> 00:18:44.638
You could also compare it with
Matthew 13:53-58 because that's

00:18:44.638 --> 00:18:46.279
where Matthew has it.
 

00:18:46.279 --> 00:18:50.336
If you were to compare Mark and
Matthew, what you would see is

00:18:50.336 --> 00:18:53.328
Matthew pretty much just follows
Mark here.

00:18:53.328 --> 00:18:57.255
He takes this story about where
he finds it in the story of

00:18:57.255 --> 00:19:01.113
Mark, and he puts it in his
story at chronologically about

00:19:01.113 --> 00:19:02.400
the same place.
 

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.492
And he doesn't have Jesus give
a long speech,

00:19:05.492 --> 00:19:09.289
he just has him appear there
and that sort of thing.

00:19:09.289 --> 00:19:10.578
Now notice what Luke does.
 

00:19:10.578 --> 00:19:13.026
Luke takes this text and he
does a lot more with it,

00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:15.328
so we're going to read it and
talk about that.

00:19:15.328 --> 00:19:19.405
"When he came to Nazareth,
where he had been brought up,

00:19:19.405 --> 00:19:23.075
he went to the synagogue on the
Sabbath day, as was his

00:19:23.075 --> 00:19:24.230
custom."
 

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.289
Now if you were a good exegete
you would notice,

00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:30.575
"as was his custom"--
you might need to look up in a

00:19:30.575 --> 00:19:35.549
concordance to see if Luke likes
that phrase,

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.650
because he does.
 

00:19:42.269 --> 00:19:44.617
He stood up and read,
and the scroll of the Prophet

00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:45.838
Isaiah was given to him.
 

00:19:45.838 --> 00:19:48.571
He unrolled the scroll and
found the place where it is

00:19:48.571 --> 00:19:50.878
written,
"The spirit of the Lord is

00:19:50.878 --> 00:19:54.191
upon me because he has anointed
me to bring good news to the

00:19:54.191 --> 00:19:54.640
poor.
 

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.363
He has sent me to proclaim
release to the captives and

00:19:57.363 --> 00:20:00.577
recovery of sight to the blind,
to let the oppressed go free,

00:20:00.577 --> 00:20:03.009
to proclaim the year of the
Lord's favor."

00:20:03.009 --> 00:20:07.237
And he rolled up the scroll,
gave it back to the attendant

00:20:07.237 --> 00:20:08.348
and sat down.
 

00:20:08.348 --> 00:20:12.078
The eyes of all in the
synagogue were fixed on him.

00:20:12.078 --> 00:20:15.317
Then he began to say to them,
"Today this scripture has

00:20:15.317 --> 00:20:17.460
been fulfilled in your
hearing."

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.358
All spoke well of him and were
amazed at the gracious words

00:20:20.358 --> 00:20:21.710
that came from his mouth.
 

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:23.519
They said, "Is not this
Joseph's son?"

00:20:23.519 --> 00:20:25.723
He said to them,
"Doubtless you will quote

00:20:25.723 --> 00:20:27.930
to me this proverb,
'Doctor, cure yourself!'

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.392
And you will say,
'Do here also in your hometown

00:20:32.392 --> 00:20:37.710
the things we have heard you did
in Capernaum.'"

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:42.980
That's interesting,
because he hasn't really got to

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:46.460
Capernaum yet in Luke's Gospel.
 

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.921
And he said,
"Truly I tell you,

00:20:47.921 --> 00:20:50.048
no prophet is accepted in the
prophet's hometown.

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:52.404
But the truth is,
there were many widows in

00:20:52.404 --> 00:20:55.619
Israel in the time of Elijah,
when the heaven was shut up for

00:20:55.619 --> 00:20:58.400
three years and six months,
and there was a severe famine

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.348
over all the land.
 

00:20:59.348 --> 00:21:02.816
Yet Elijah was sent to none of
them except to a widow at

00:21:02.816 --> 00:21:04.140
Zarephath in Sidon.
 

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.457
There were also many lepers in
Israel in the time of prophet

00:21:07.457 --> 00:21:10.493
Elisha, and none of them was
cleansed except Naaman the

00:21:10.493 --> 00:21:11.450
Syrian."
 

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.944
When they heard this--
Now notice they started out the

00:21:14.944 --> 00:21:17.864
scene, they're all happy,
he's the hometown boy,

00:21:17.864 --> 00:21:20.162
he's come home,
they are amazed at his

00:21:20.162 --> 00:21:22.150
teaching, the mood changes.
 

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:27.450
Why does the mood change right
there?

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.385
When they heard this,
all in the synagogue were

00:21:30.385 --> 00:21:31.598
filled with rage.
 

00:21:31.598 --> 00:21:33.134
They got up,
drove him out of town,

00:21:33.134 --> 00:21:35.751
and led him to the brow of the
hill on which their town was

00:21:35.751 --> 00:21:38.098
built so that they might hurl
him off the cliff.

00:21:38.098 --> 00:21:40.529
But he passed through the midst
of them and went on his way.

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:43.159
He went down to Capernaum,
a city of Galilee,

00:21:43.159 --> 00:21:45.490
and was teaching them on the
Sabbath.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.518
Notice, this is when he moves
to Capernaum from Nazareth in

00:21:49.518 --> 00:21:50.630
Luke's Gospel.
 

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:54.509
In all the synoptic Gospels,
Jesus makes Capernaum his home

00:21:54.509 --> 00:21:57.720
base in Galilee,
not his hometown of Nazareth.

00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:01.943
According to Mark and Matthew
it's later in their Gospels that

00:22:01.943 --> 00:22:05.200
Jesus is rejected in Nazareth
and makes his--

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.200
then moves and makes his home
in Capernaum.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:11.448
Notice that Luke knows this,
Luke is giving us a clue that

00:22:11.448 --> 00:22:15.621
he knows he's taking this
passage out of its context from

00:22:15.621 --> 00:22:19.048
where he found it because the
people say,

00:22:19.048 --> 00:22:21.519
"Do for us what you did in
Capernaum."

00:22:21.519 --> 00:22:26.440
Implying that they think of
Capernaum as his home base,

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.750
well that's because by that
time in Mark and Matthew,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.864
it was his home base,
by the time he gives this

00:22:30.864 --> 00:22:31.828
speech in Nazareth.
 

00:22:31.828 --> 00:22:37.067
Luke takes this passage that he
finds later in Mark and he moves

00:22:37.067 --> 00:22:41.638
it and plops it down at the
beginning of Jesus' Galilean

00:22:41.638 --> 00:22:42.720
ministry.
 

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.178
He wants this speech to be
Jesus' first speech,

00:22:47.178 --> 00:22:50.568
this sermon,
Jesus' first sermon.

00:22:50.568 --> 00:22:53.575
Maybe that means that if we
analyze the content of the

00:22:53.575 --> 00:22:57.586
sermon we can try to figure out,
why did Luke change the setting

00:22:57.586 --> 00:23:01.116
of the story to be at the
beginning of the ministry and

00:23:01.116 --> 00:23:04.190
then also why did he make it so
much bigger?

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:06.509
It occupies only a few little
verses in Mark,

00:23:06.509 --> 00:23:09.428
and Luke expands it into this
whole speech and makes it this

00:23:09.428 --> 00:23:11.213
big conflict,
so let's look at several

00:23:11.213 --> 00:23:11.960
different things.
 

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:15.608
First, I said--he says,
"as was his custom."

00:23:15.608 --> 00:23:19.913
As we'll talk about next week,
one of the main themes of the

00:23:19.913 --> 00:23:24.436
Gospel of Luke and Acts is that
good Jewish boys do good Jewish

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:25.240
things.
 

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:27.929
They go to synagogue,
they know their scripture,

00:23:27.929 --> 00:23:30.046
they're circumcised,
they keep kosher,

00:23:30.046 --> 00:23:31.818
they worship in the temple.
 

00:23:31.818 --> 00:23:36.818
So Jesus also is depicted by
Luke as a good Jewish boy.

00:23:36.818 --> 00:23:39.269
We'll see next time,
and I'm going to talk about

00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:42.500
some of these themes a bit more
fully in both Luke and Acts.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:44.403
And I'll talk about,
for example,

00:23:44.403 --> 00:23:48.150
why is it only in Luke that he
tells us that Jesus' parents,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.325
after he was born,
circumcised him on the eighth

00:23:50.325 --> 00:23:53.589
day like they were supposed to,
after a month they take him to

00:23:53.589 --> 00:23:55.450
the temple for the presentation.
 

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.134
All of this,
and Luke even tells us,

00:23:57.134 --> 00:23:59.544
this is to fulfill the
scripture and to fulfill the

00:23:59.544 --> 00:24:01.759
law, and he's referring back to
Leviticus.

00:24:01.759 --> 00:24:04.710
So Jesus' mother and father are
good Jewish parents,

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:06.598
they do exactly what the law
tells them to do,

00:24:06.598 --> 00:24:09.308
and Jesus is a good Jewish boy,
so another clue here,

00:24:09.308 --> 00:24:13.509
"as was his custom,"
this is like Jesus goes to

00:24:13.509 --> 00:24:15.308
temple every Saturday.
 

00:24:15.308 --> 00:24:18.082
Look also, "the spirit of
the Lord,"

00:24:18.082 --> 00:24:20.345
he says in verse 18,
he cites the text,

00:24:20.345 --> 00:24:23.259
"The spirit of the Lord is
upon me because he has anointed

00:24:23.259 --> 00:24:25.278
me to bring good news to the
poor."

00:24:25.278 --> 00:24:29.145
Again, if you took a
concordance and searched all the

00:24:29.145 --> 00:24:32.727
times in Luke and Acts,
when the spirit either called

00:24:32.727 --> 00:24:36.136
the Holy Spirit or sometimes
just the spirit or the spirit of

00:24:36.136 --> 00:24:38.366
God occurs,
you'll find this is one of

00:24:38.366 --> 00:24:39.640
Luke's favorite themes.
 

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.354
The Holy Spirit,
in fact, is the main actor in

00:24:42.354 --> 00:24:43.500
the book of Acts.
 

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:46.720
Jesus is the main actor in the
Gospel of Luke,

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.423
Jesus leaves the scene,
he kind of talks from offstage

00:24:49.423 --> 00:24:51.785
every once in a while--
talk to Saul,

00:24:51.785 --> 00:24:54.288
Saul why do you persecute me?
 

00:24:54.288 --> 00:24:56.618
But Jesus is kind of saying
that from offstage.

00:24:56.618 --> 00:25:00.400
The real actor in the book of
Luke is the Holy Spirit.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.923
--So, again,
at the beginning of this

00:25:02.923 --> 00:25:06.640
lecture, this sermon,
Jesus talks about the spirit.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.420
Notice also the--"sent me
to bring good news to the poor,

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.318
he has sent me to proclaim
release to the captives,

00:25:12.318 --> 00:25:16.405
recovery of sight to the blind,
to let the oppressed go

00:25:16.405 --> 00:25:17.390
free."
 

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:19.098
Any of you know the Magnificat?
 

00:25:19.098 --> 00:25:23.019
The song that's sung by Mary
when she's told by the angel

00:25:23.019 --> 00:25:24.630
that she is pregnant?
 

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:28.798
It's a very important
liturgical piece;

00:25:28.798 --> 00:25:31.420
I'll talk about it again next
time in a little bit more depth.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.019
If you go to a Catholic church
or an Episcopalian church,

00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:37.798
chances are you'll say the
Magnificat,

00:25:37.798 --> 00:25:39.690
"My soul blesses the
Lord."

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.369
It's called the Magnificat
because "my soul magnifies

00:25:42.369 --> 00:25:43.170
the Lord."
 

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:47.387
In the Latin the first word of
the song that Mary says is

00:25:47.387 --> 00:25:50.529
magnificat,
that is "magnifies,"

00:25:50.529 --> 00:25:52.608
"my soul magnifies the
Lord."

00:25:52.608 --> 00:25:56.116
That song that Mary says has
all this stuff about God

00:25:56.116 --> 00:25:59.759
will--that her son will lift up
the poor and oppressed,

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:03.565
God will help the poor;
he will send the rich away

00:26:03.565 --> 00:26:04.098
empty.
 

00:26:04.098 --> 00:26:06.220
Over and over again that song
by Mary,

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:09.712
this idea that God's going to
perform this great reversal of

00:26:09.712 --> 00:26:12.048
rich and poor,
the poor will be helped and

00:26:12.048 --> 00:26:13.999
made rich,
the rich will be made poor,

00:26:13.999 --> 00:26:17.244
the high will be sent down low,
the low will be raised up high,

00:26:17.244 --> 00:26:20.108
so we've already seen this
theme already in the Gospel of

00:26:20.108 --> 00:26:21.803
Luke,
and now it's right here in

00:26:21.803 --> 00:26:22.799
Jesus' first sermon.
 

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:24.470
That's another theme.
 

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:31.857
Look at verse 19,
"To proclaim the year of

00:26:31.857 --> 00:26:34.019
the Lord's favor."
 

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:36.660
If you use an older
translation, like the King James

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.470
Version,
anybody else have--what do you

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.452
have for 19,
"To proclaim the year of

00:26:40.452 --> 00:26:42.723
the Lord's favor,"
anybody have a different

00:26:42.723 --> 00:26:43.450
translation?
 

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:44.868
Nope--yes sir?
 

00:26:44.868 --> 00:26:47.920
Student: 
&gt;

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:49.868
Prof: "The year
acceptable to the Lord."

00:26:49.868 --> 00:26:52.623
A lot of translations--the
older translations will say,

00:26:52.623 --> 00:26:54.815
"To proclaim the
acceptable year of the

00:26:54.815 --> 00:26:55.578
Lord."
 

00:26:55.578 --> 00:26:59.058
That's--as we'll see--that's
another theme of Luke.

00:26:59.058 --> 00:27:02.068
He's quoting it from scripture
but then he incorporates it.

00:27:02.068 --> 00:27:04.547
For example,
there will be a time later

00:27:04.547 --> 00:27:08.263
where we'll see that at one
point Jesus condemns Jerusalem

00:27:08.263 --> 00:27:11.720
because "they did not
recognize the time of their

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.220
visitation."
 

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:19.558
Jesus' being there on earth
represents this special time.

00:27:19.558 --> 00:27:23.250
It's a focus of history on one
point of time.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:25.866
Again, Jesus in his first
sermon quotes this

00:27:25.866 --> 00:27:29.519
"acceptable year of the
Lord" as being his year;

00:27:29.519 --> 00:27:32.568
it's the Jesus year in Judea.
 

00:27:32.568 --> 00:27:37.779
Then another theme that you see
here is what happens to Jesus.

00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:39.720
First Jesus sets himself up as
a prophet,

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.420
right, by quoting--by citing
stories about Elijah,

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.828
who helped the woman--the
widow's son,

00:27:45.828 --> 00:27:50.066
and Elisha, so Elijah and
Elisha are important prophets

00:27:50.066 --> 00:27:53.990
for Luke and Jesus portrays as
being like that,

00:27:53.990 --> 00:28:00.038
so that's why he says:
No prophet is accepted in the

00:28:00.038 --> 00:28:01.278
prophet's hometown.
 

00:28:01.278 --> 00:28:03.528
But the truth is there were
many widows in Israel in the

00:28:03.528 --> 00:28:06.025
time of Elijah when the heaven
was shut up for three years and

00:28:06.025 --> 00:28:07.640
six months,
there was severe famine,

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.960
yet Elijah was not sent to
them.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.317
Elijah wasn't sent to the Jews,
to any Jewish widows

00:28:12.317 --> 00:28:16.202
didn't--weren't there Jewish
widows who needed a little help

00:28:16.202 --> 00:28:17.058
too, God?
 

00:28:17.058 --> 00:28:21.609
Well yeah, but he wasn't sent
to the Jewish widows he was sent

00:28:21.609 --> 00:28:25.490
to a non-Jewish widow,
a woman who lived in Sidon.

00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:28.210
"There were many lepers in
Israel in the time of prophet

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:28.890
Elisha."
 

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:33.098
Elisha was the junior prophet
to Elijah,

00:28:33.098 --> 00:28:35.180
Elijah anointed Elisha--not
anoint him,

00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:36.640
he gave him his mantel and so
Elisha,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.930
after Elijah went up in the
fiery chariot,

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:42.109
the flying fiery chariot you've
heard the story,

00:28:42.109 --> 00:28:43.876
"swing low swing chariot,
coming for to take me

00:28:43.876 --> 00:28:44.390
home."
 

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.913
Elijah doesn't die at the end
of his life he's swooped up in a

00:28:47.913 --> 00:28:50.891
fiery chariot into heaven and,
right before that,

00:28:50.891 --> 00:28:54.282
he gives his mantel to his
disciple Elisha and then Elisha

00:28:54.282 --> 00:28:56.009
is the prophet from there.
 

00:28:56.009 --> 00:28:59.018
Elisha also,
weren't there many Jewish

00:28:59.018 --> 00:29:00.318
lepers Elisha?
 

00:29:00.318 --> 00:29:03.220
Couldn't you take a nice Jewish
leper to heal Elisha?

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.913
No Jesus says,
he wasn't sent to them he was

00:29:06.913 --> 00:29:09.318
sent to Naaman the Syrian.
 

00:29:09.318 --> 00:29:13.349
So I said, when they heard
this, all in the synagogue were

00:29:13.349 --> 00:29:16.250
filled with rage,
and I said, why this?

00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:18.098
What were they so upset with?
 

00:29:18.098 --> 00:29:22.453
Now you tell me,
why does he say they were

00:29:22.453 --> 00:29:25.640
filled with rage right then?
 

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.890
What, just say it, shout it out.
 

00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.230
You know.
 

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.230
Are there are no Jewish lepers,
Elisha?

00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:40.410
Are there no Jewish widows,
Elijah?

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.900
Why are they mad?
 

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.680
Student:  He's saying
he's not there for them.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.438
Prof: Yeah,
Jesus is saying,

00:29:47.438 --> 00:29:50.960
I'm not here for you,
or at least he's saying Elijah

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:53.619
and Elisha were sent to
Gentiles,

00:29:53.619 --> 00:29:55.579
not to Jews.
 

00:29:55.579 --> 00:29:57.880
Notice what Luke has done here.
 

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.039
He's set up Jesus as a prophet
like Elijah and Elisha,

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:06.435
and he had Jesus himself
predict that the message will go

00:30:06.435 --> 00:30:08.318
out to the Gentiles.
 

00:30:08.318 --> 00:30:11.298
It hasn't gone out yet to
Gentiles, in the Gospel of Luke

00:30:11.298 --> 00:30:13.480
Jesus pretty much sticks with
the Jews.

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:17.740
In fact, Peter has to have a
revelation in Acts before he

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.848
will go preach to a Gentile,
as we'll see next time.

00:30:21.848 --> 00:30:25.835
The Gentiles are not receiving
the Gospel yet but Jesus is

00:30:25.835 --> 00:30:29.612
predicting that they will,
so that's another theme here

00:30:29.612 --> 00:30:31.568
that Luke is playing on.
 

00:30:31.568 --> 00:30:34.840
Notice the other thing,
what happens when Jesus does

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.289
this?
 

00:30:35.289 --> 00:30:37.098
He's rejected by his own people.
 

00:30:37.098 --> 00:30:43.163
So another theme of Luke and
Acts is true prophets get

00:30:43.163 --> 00:30:46.710
rejected by their own people.
 

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.269
A prophet in his own country is
not accepted.

00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:54.759
Jesus is a great Prophet like
Elijah and Elisha,

00:30:54.759 --> 00:30:57.068
he's not accepted in his own
country,

00:30:57.068 --> 00:31:00.173
he's rejected,
and the Gentile mission happens

00:31:00.173 --> 00:31:02.519
after the rejection by the Jews.
 

00:31:02.519 --> 00:31:04.778
That's going to be a theme that
we'll see over and over in Acts;

00:31:04.778 --> 00:31:06.009
not so much in the Gospel of
Luke.

00:31:06.009 --> 00:31:09.972
Luke is foreshadowing the book
of Acts in this chapter with

00:31:09.972 --> 00:31:13.730
Jesus' sermon because Jesus
himself doesn't go preach to

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:14.618
Gentiles.
 

00:31:14.618 --> 00:31:17.078
You have to wait until Acts to
get that.

00:31:17.078 --> 00:31:20.674
But Luke is foreshadowing the
rejection of the Gospel by Jews

00:31:20.674 --> 00:31:24.270
and the taking of the Gospel to
the Gentiles that you'll then

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.963
see in Acts,
and he foreshadows it all right

00:31:26.963 --> 00:31:28.910
here in this first sermon by
Jesus.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:32.084
Then the last theme that you
have here is them trying to kill

00:31:32.084 --> 00:31:34.619
Jesus for what he says,
which that's going to

00:31:34.619 --> 00:31:37.880
foreshadow the theme all the way
through that the Gospel--

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.420
wherever the Gospel goes you
get persecution.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.287
When we get to Acts you'll see
this in a way that just drums it

00:31:44.287 --> 00:31:46.720
into your head:
Paul goes to a town,

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.680
he goes first to the synagogue
in the town,

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.798
he preaches to the Jews in the
synagogue,

00:31:51.798 --> 00:31:54.420
they get all mad,
some of them usually accept,

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.160
a few of them will accept,
we'll see that as a theme in

00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.348
Acts also,
but the majority of them don't.

00:31:59.348 --> 00:32:01.328
They reject Paul,
they throw him out,

00:32:01.328 --> 00:32:03.670
they try to stone him,
or they try to persecute him,

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:07.102
or they try to throw him out
town and then Paul turns and

00:32:07.102 --> 00:32:09.858
preaches the same message to the
Gentiles,

00:32:09.858 --> 00:32:13.108
and they accept,
and they form a church.

00:32:13.108 --> 00:32:16.368
He goes to the next town,
he does this in Thessalonica,

00:32:16.368 --> 00:32:18.500
he does it in Philippi,
he does it in Corinth,

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.096
he tries it in Athens but he's
not successful because nobody

00:32:21.096 --> 00:32:22.769
pays any attention to him in
Athens.

00:32:22.769 --> 00:32:26.661
That's a university town after
all, they know better,

00:32:26.661 --> 00:32:27.259
right?
 

00:32:27.259 --> 00:32:30.058
This theme of the prophets
being rejected and it's the

00:32:30.058 --> 00:32:33.174
rejection of the message by the
Jews that causes the message

00:32:33.174 --> 00:32:35.130
then to be taken to the
Gentiles.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:38.741
That will play out over and
over again, and here again you

00:32:38.741 --> 00:32:39.630
get it here.
 

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:44.731
So Luke has transposed the
story about Jesus preaching in

00:32:44.731 --> 00:32:48.650
Nazareth from where he finds it
in Mark,

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:51.968
which is later in Jesus'
ministry, and he puts it at the

00:32:51.968 --> 00:32:55.490
beginning of Jesus' ministry,
and he packs it up with all

00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:56.548
this other stuff.
 

00:32:56.548 --> 00:32:59.414
That should be a very good clue
to you if you're comparing Luke

00:32:59.414 --> 00:33:01.480
with Mark;
you just know this must be

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:03.440
important;
this must be a way where we

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.298
really see what this author is
about.

00:33:05.298 --> 00:33:11.392
Notice: is Luke concerned about
when the event in Nazareth

00:33:11.392 --> 00:33:14.920
actually historically happened?
 

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.555
No, he's even--you can tell
he's even getting it out of his

00:33:19.555 --> 00:33:23.871
source from one spot and
consciously transferring it to

00:33:23.871 --> 00:33:26.855
another spot,
which tells us one thing,

00:33:26.855 --> 00:33:30.441
is that to him it's not that
important chronologically when

00:33:30.441 --> 00:33:32.420
this story actually happened.
 

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.714
What's important to him is
using the story to emphasize the

00:33:35.714 --> 00:33:38.500
theological message that he
wants to emphasize.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.720
Now let's look at another place
where Luke does this.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:48.868
You have to turn to Acts for
this though, look at Acts 11.

00:33:48.868 --> 00:33:53.410
Any questions about that before
I go on?

00:33:53.410 --> 00:33:54.730
No questions?
 

00:33:54.730 --> 00:34:01.644
I love good docile students,
always happy with everything I

00:34:01.644 --> 00:34:02.359
say.
 

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:05.779
Look at Chapter 11:19.
 

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:15.847
Now I already read this earlier
and then I read it actually in

00:34:15.847 --> 00:34:17.989
another lecture,
but it's very important to see

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.059
what Luke is doing.
 

00:34:19.059 --> 00:34:22.079
Now those who were scattered,
because of the persecution that

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:24.813
took place over Stephen,
traveled as far as Phoenicia,

00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:25.913
Cyprus,
and Antioch,

00:34:25.913 --> 00:34:28.550
and they spoke the word to no
one except Jews.

00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:31.239
But among them were some men of
Cyrus and Cyrene who,

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:33.775
on coming to Antioch spoke to
the Hellenists also,

00:34:33.775 --> 00:34:35.380
proclaiming the Lord Jesus.
 

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.050
The hand of the Lord was with
them, and a great number became

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:39.610
believers and turned to the
Lord.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.349
News of this came to the ears
of the church in Jerusalem,

00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:44.110
and they sent Barnabas to
Antioch.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.110
When he came and saw the grace
of God,

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:47.726
he rejoiced,
and he exhorted them all to

00:34:47.726 --> 00:34:50.338
remain faithful in the Lord with
steadfast devotion for he was a

00:34:50.338 --> 00:34:52.159
good man,
full of the Holy Spirit and of

00:34:52.159 --> 00:34:52.449
faith.
 

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:53.860
And a great many ...
 

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.155
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to
look for Saul,

00:34:56.155 --> 00:34:58.760
and when he found,
him he brought him to Antioch.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:01.152
So it was that for an entire
year they met with the church

00:35:01.152 --> 00:35:04.559
and taught a great many people,
and it was in Antioch that the

00:35:04.559 --> 00:35:07.199
disciples were first called
Christians.

00:35:07.199 --> 00:35:09.889
Isn't that a nice little
encapsulation?

00:35:09.889 --> 00:35:13.230
In that little paragraph Luke,
the author,

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.590
who we still tend to call these
Gospel writers by these names

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:17.873
even though we don't believe
historically that this was the

00:35:17.873 --> 00:35:19.902
historical Luke,
but I'll still keep calling him

00:35:19.902 --> 00:35:22.155
Luke because it's easier then
saying "the author"

00:35:22.155 --> 00:35:22.659
each time.
 

00:35:22.659 --> 00:35:26.438
Luke takes a little paragraph
in which he shifts your focus

00:35:26.438 --> 00:35:30.710
here from the whole Jerusalem,
Judea, Jewish oriented form of

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:33.860
the movement,
and now he goes to Antioch and

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.789
now you get this Greek kind of
movement,

00:35:36.789 --> 00:35:38.630
it's predominantly in a Greek
speaking city,

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:39.500
Antioch.
 

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.331
This is one of the reasons that
I think that that word that my

00:35:42.331 --> 00:35:44.757
translation translates,
"Hellenist,"

00:35:44.757 --> 00:35:46.860
they spoke to Hellenists in
verse 20;

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:48.768
I think that's not correct.
 

00:35:48.768 --> 00:35:51.010
I think that either in the
original Greek,

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:53.639
and some manuscripts have this,
or you just would translate

00:35:53.639 --> 00:35:55.329
this word,
it must be that they--it's

00:35:55.329 --> 00:35:56.809
saying that they spoke to
Greeks,

00:35:56.809 --> 00:35:58.420
that is ethnic Greeks.
 

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.987
Why do I think this is a
reference to ethnic Greeks and

00:36:02.987 --> 00:36:05.610
not just Greek speaking Jews?
 

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:09.639
Anybody have an idea?
 

00:36:09.639 --> 00:36:13.833
Because this isn't the first
time that people--that followers

00:36:13.833 --> 00:36:17.050
of Jesus have spoken to Greek
speaking Jews.

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.768
We already have in
Jerusalem--he has already told

00:36:19.768 --> 00:36:23.052
us in the earlier part of Acts
that in Jerusalem there were

00:36:23.052 --> 00:36:26.110
already Greek speaking Jews part
of the community.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:29.351
In fact it says that,
Stephen himself would have

00:36:29.351 --> 00:36:32.110
talked with these Greek speaking
Jews.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.059
So we already have before we
get to chapter 11,

00:36:35.059 --> 00:36:38.913
the idea that the Gospel of
Jesus has been taken both to

00:36:38.913 --> 00:36:42.907
Aramaic speaking Jews and Greek
speaking Jews because it's

00:36:42.907 --> 00:36:45.079
already there in Jerusalem.
 

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:48.690
He's talking about something
new happening here,

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.942
this is people not just
speaking to Aramaic speaking

00:36:51.942 --> 00:36:56.445
Jews or to Greek speaking Jews,
they're actually speaking to

00:36:56.445 --> 00:36:57.280
non-Jews.
 

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.427
This is the first time you get
this indication in the book of

00:37:01.427 --> 00:37:03.663
Acts,
that the movement has now

00:37:03.663 --> 00:37:08.297
spread out from Jerusalem,
and it's also being spread to

00:37:08.297 --> 00:37:10.420
Greeks,
ethnic Greeks.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:11.489
And I think by
"Greeks"

00:37:11.489 --> 00:37:14.036
he just means Gentiles,
not just Greeks ethnically but

00:37:14.036 --> 00:37:17.110
anybody who wasn't a Jew is what
he mainly means here.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:22.590
What's interesting is that this
is kind of out of place.

00:37:22.590 --> 00:37:25.702
One of the things I'm arguing
is that unlike this translation

00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:27.675
I just read,
which might lead you to believe

00:37:27.675 --> 00:37:29.835
that the author is telling us
this is the first time they

00:37:29.835 --> 00:37:32.876
spoke to Greek speaking Jews,
I think that the original text

00:37:32.876 --> 00:37:35.539
must have meant that,
this is the first time that

00:37:35.539 --> 00:37:37.768
these people are speaking to
actual non-Jews.

00:37:37.768 --> 00:37:41.788
Now it's not the first time,
though, that people in Acts

00:37:41.788 --> 00:37:44.199
have spoken to non-Jews,
right?

00:37:44.199 --> 00:37:46.349
When's the first time,
according to Acts,

00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:49.148
that people actually speak to
non-Jews and preach the Gospel

00:37:49.148 --> 00:37:51.360
to non-Jews,
and non-Jews become members of

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:51.960
the church?
 

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.360
When?
 

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.880
Have you read Acts yet?
 

00:37:55.880 --> 00:38:00.340
Cornelius, the centurion,
the Roman centurion.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.800
Remember I said,
Peter has to have a whole

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:06.460
series of revelations on top of
the roof before he's convinced

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:09.880
to finally go preach to a
Gentile and convert him and that

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:11.619
takes place in Acts 10.
 

00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:19.398
Now keep your finger on Acts
11:19 and flip over to Acts

00:38:19.398 --> 00:38:20.530
8:1-4.
 

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:23.827
I think I may have mentioned
this already but let's look at

00:38:23.827 --> 00:38:25.079
it a bit closer now.
 

00:38:25.079 --> 00:38:29.273
Acts 8:1-4, this takes place
right after the stoning of

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:30.050
Stephen.
 

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.860
Hmmm.
 

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:39.309
Stephen, is that a good Hebrew
or Aramaic name?

00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:42.947
No, does anybody know where the
word--where the name Stephen

00:38:42.947 --> 00:38:43.750
comes from?
 

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:45.510
Raise your hand, yes sir?
 

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.329
Student:  Crown.
 

00:38:46.329 --> 00:38:48.019
Prof: Crown,
are you a Stephen?

00:38:48.019 --> 00:38:49.659
No, you just know.
 

00:38:49.659 --> 00:38:51.429
Yes, it comes from the word
stephanos in Greek,

00:38:51.429 --> 00:38:52.500
which means "crown."
 

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:56.219
Notice already there are Greek
speaking Jews who have Greeks

00:38:56.219 --> 00:38:59.309
names in the church,
and Stephen's one of them.

00:38:59.309 --> 00:39:02.362
In fact, the seven deacons who
are appointed that we could have

00:39:02.362 --> 00:39:04.579
read about just right before
this in Acts,

00:39:04.579 --> 00:39:07.139
those are appointed precisely
in order,

00:39:07.139 --> 00:39:09.750
according to Acts,
to be able to minister to the

00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:12.278
Greek speakers,
because some Greek speaking

00:39:12.278 --> 00:39:15.563
widows were being neglected in
the distribution of food and

00:39:15.563 --> 00:39:17.289
funds,
according to the text.

00:39:17.289 --> 00:39:18.989
The seven deacons are appointed.
 

00:39:18.989 --> 00:39:21.068
Those seven deacons some of
them have--they have Greek

00:39:21.068 --> 00:39:23.068
names, so there are Greek
speaking Jews in Jerusalem

00:39:23.068 --> 00:39:23.539
already.
 

00:39:23.539 --> 00:39:28.201
So right after the stoning of
Stephen you have this,

00:39:28.201 --> 00:39:30.242
chapter 8:
And Saul approved of their

00:39:30.242 --> 00:39:30.670
killing him.
 

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:34.646
That day a severe persecution
began against the church in

00:39:34.646 --> 00:39:37.402
Jerusalem,
and all except the apostles

00:39:37.402 --> 00:39:41.001
were scattered throughout the
countryside of Judea and

00:39:41.001 --> 00:39:41.750
Samaria.
 

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:46.929
Devout men buried Stephen and
made loud lamentation over him.

00:39:46.929 --> 00:39:49.934
But Saul was ravaging the
church by entering house after

00:39:49.934 --> 00:39:53.157
house, dragging off both men and
women, he committed them to

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:53.760
prison.
 

00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.922
Now those who were scattered,
after the stoning of Stephen,

00:39:57.922 --> 00:40:01.369
went from place to place
proclaiming the word.

00:40:01.369 --> 00:40:04.969
Phillip, who was one of those
deacons along with Stephen,

00:40:04.969 --> 00:40:07.670
Phillip, that's a good Greek
name right?

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:10.876
At least it's a Macedonian
name, named after the king of

00:40:10.876 --> 00:40:11.460
Macedon.
 

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.688
"Phillip went down to the
city of Samaria and proclaimed

00:40:13.688 --> 00:40:14.730
the Messiah to them."
 

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.902
Then you get Phillip going to
Samaria and so forth and you'll

00:40:17.902 --> 00:40:19.489
have other things happening.
 

00:40:19.489 --> 00:40:21.960
Now keep your finger--you had
your finger there,

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.333
notice that he's saying,
"Now those who were

00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:26.757
scattered went from place to
place proclaiming the

00:40:26.757 --> 00:40:27.500
word."
 

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:31.289
Flip over without thinking
anything,

00:40:31.289 --> 00:40:34.257
don't think anything,
Acts 11:19, "Now those who

00:40:34.257 --> 00:40:37.512
were scattered because of the
persecutions that took place

00:40:37.512 --> 00:40:39.909
over Stephen traveled as far
as."

00:40:39.909 --> 00:40:43.768
You see Luke seems to have had
a source,

00:40:43.768 --> 00:40:47.577
maybe a written source,
that had this message about the

00:40:47.577 --> 00:40:51.137
stoning of Stephen,
the persecution that arose in

00:40:51.137 --> 00:40:54.317
Jerusalem,
and then the dispersal of Greek

00:40:54.317 --> 00:40:58.059
speaking followers of Jesus,
and they don't just go to

00:40:58.059 --> 00:41:00.699
Samaria as Phillip did,
it actually says, "Then,

00:41:00.699 --> 00:41:03.619
they went to Phoenicia,
Cyprus, Antioch ...

00:41:03.619 --> 00:41:06.780
speaking to no one but
Jews," but then it has this

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:09.179
message to the Greeks and the
Gentiles.

00:41:09.179 --> 00:41:12.639
In other word,
from 8:4 it must have

00:41:12.639 --> 00:41:18.469
originally joined on to what
goes with 11:19 because you can

00:41:18.469 --> 00:41:24.983
just see this narrative stops,
and then it picks up again in

00:41:24.983 --> 00:41:25.719
11:19.
 

00:41:25.719 --> 00:41:30.306
Luke took what was a text or a
source for him that had this

00:41:30.306 --> 00:41:33.550
story that this kind of thing in
order.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:37.971
Stephen preaches the Gospel to
the Jews, they get mad at him,

00:41:37.971 --> 00:41:40.550
they persecute him and stone
him.

00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:44.429
The persecution of Stephen
leads to more persecution of the

00:41:44.429 --> 00:41:47.177
church in Jerusalem,
the rejection of the Gospel by

00:41:47.177 --> 00:41:49.327
the Jews,
the disciples are scattered and

00:41:49.327 --> 00:41:51.309
they go and who do they preach
too?

00:41:51.309 --> 00:41:52.349
The Gentiles.
 

00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:54.969
Haven't we seen this pattern
before?

00:41:54.969 --> 00:41:58.260
We all saw it in the very first
sermon of Jesus,

00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:58.820
right?
 

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:02.467
What Luke has done is he's
split this thing which showed

00:42:02.467 --> 00:42:05.481
that pattern,
and in it he put all the stuff

00:42:05.481 --> 00:42:10.061
that's in chapters 8,
9, and 10 and the first part of

00:42:10.061 --> 00:42:12.150
11 in between there.
 

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:16.485
Now you tell me,
why did Luke split a narrative

00:42:16.485 --> 00:42:21.670
and put this material in between
those two sentences?

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:26.818
What's in that material between
8,9, 10, and 11 that was--that

00:42:26.818 --> 00:42:29.349
Luke wanted to insert there?
 

00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:31.449
What?
 

00:42:31.449 --> 00:42:33.409
Pardon?
 

00:42:33.409 --> 00:42:34.679
Student: 
&gt;

00:42:34.679 --> 00:42:40.820
Prof: Peter preaching to
Cornelius, the Gentile.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:44.958
What Luke is doing is he has a
source that basically--who were

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:47.739
the first people to preach to
Gentiles?

00:42:47.739 --> 00:42:50.010
They're anonymous,
according to his source;

00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:51.090
we don't know who they are.
 

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:53.380
Just some people,
some followers of Jesus,

00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:56.130
Greek speaking followers of
Jesus who were--

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.226
left Jerusalem and Judea,
they traveled around different

00:42:58.226 --> 00:42:59.494
parts,
they went to the Eastern

00:42:59.494 --> 00:43:01.114
Mediterranean,
and as they went they took the

00:43:01.114 --> 00:43:02.759
Gospel with them,
and along the way they even

00:43:02.759 --> 00:43:04.963
spoke not only to Greek speaking
Jews but they even spoke to

00:43:04.963 --> 00:43:06.710
Gentiles,
that's what his source says.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.639
Luke splits that and--he
doesn't want to do that.

00:43:09.639 --> 00:43:13.007
First he wants to say,
well Phillip went to Samaria

00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:16.780
and he preached to Samaria,
so you have Samaria there.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.518
Then you have this whole thing
with Peter.

00:43:18.518 --> 00:43:19.699
And you know the story about
Peter,

00:43:19.699 --> 00:43:23.217
he's up on the rooftop praying
and this sheet with all these

00:43:23.217 --> 00:43:25.643
unclean animals,
with alligators and snakes,

00:43:25.643 --> 00:43:28.659
and stuff that was somehow some
Sunday school material I had,

00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:32.394
had a sheet with alligators and
snakes and stuff coming down for

00:43:32.394 --> 00:43:32.869
Peter.
 

00:43:32.869 --> 00:43:35.853
It doesn't tell us in the text
that there were alligators and

00:43:35.853 --> 00:43:38.340
snakes, it just part of my
Sunday school memory.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.659
There are unclean animals,
and he's commanded to kill them

00:43:40.659 --> 00:43:41.672
and eat them,
and he says,

00:43:41.672 --> 00:43:42.730
I'm a good Jew,
I don't eat that,

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.880
that's not kosher,
and a voice from heaven says,

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:47.079
what God has cleansed don't you
declare unclean.

00:43:47.079 --> 00:43:48.931
The vision happens three times.
 

00:43:48.931 --> 00:43:49.230
Why?
 

00:43:49.230 --> 00:43:53.090
Because Peter does not want to
take the message to Gentiles.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.170
Is your hand up?
 

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.980
Nope okay.
 

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.550
So finally Peter is forced to
take the message to Gentiles,

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.889
by God, by revelation,
and then you have the story of

00:44:00.889 --> 00:44:02.780
the baptism of Cornelius and his
house,

00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:04.010
the first Gentile converts.
 

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:06.590
And then Peter goes back to
Jerusalem and all the people--

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.449
the Jews in Jerusalem say,
why did you do that,

00:44:08.449 --> 00:44:10.501
you're not supposed to bring in
uncircumcised people in the

00:44:10.501 --> 00:44:10.820
church.
 

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:13.489
And Peter has to defend the
whole thing and then finally

00:44:13.489 --> 00:44:15.775
Peter wins the argument,
and even James,

00:44:15.775 --> 00:44:18.250
the conservative head of the
church,

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:20.402
turns to them and says,
okay well God must have been

00:44:20.402 --> 00:44:21.670
including the Gentiles also.
 

00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:25.298
Luke wants Peter to be the
first person to take the message

00:44:25.298 --> 00:44:28.802
to Gentiles, and he wants Peter
to do so only after being

00:44:28.802 --> 00:44:30.679
compelled by God to do so.
 

00:44:30.679 --> 00:44:33.168
Luke knows that the first
people who took the message to

00:44:33.168 --> 00:44:35.704
Gentiles were probably just
anonymous followers of Jesus,

00:44:35.704 --> 00:44:37.380
because in the source it's
there.

00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:40.693
He splits that source and he
puts all this stuff about Peter

00:44:40.693 --> 00:44:44.121
there because he wants Peter to
be the first and only then the

00:44:44.121 --> 00:44:44.739
others.
 

00:44:44.739 --> 00:44:48.268
In other words,
what you get there is a key to

00:44:48.268 --> 00:44:51.170
what is the entire outline of
Acts.

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:54.849
Look back at Acts 1:8.
 

00:44:54.849 --> 00:45:01.989
Acts 1:8 gives you,
in a sense, the outline of

00:45:01.989 --> 00:45:03.099
Acts.
 

00:45:03.099 --> 00:45:06.969
This is Jesus about to ascend
into heaven, talking to his

00:45:06.969 --> 00:45:10.492
disciples, right outside
Jerusalem in the suburbs of

00:45:10.492 --> 00:45:11.460
Jerusalem.
 

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.730
"But you will receive
power when the Holy

00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:15.898
Spirit,"
again there's that Holy Spirit

00:45:15.898 --> 00:45:18.139
important for Luke,
"has come upon you.

00:45:18.139 --> 00:45:22.260
You will be my witnesses in
Jerusalem and all Judea,

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:25.007
and Samaria,
and to the ends of the

00:45:25.007 --> 00:45:26.300
earth."
 

00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:31.210
That's exactly the way he will
construct the book of Acts.

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:35.460
Jerusalem--Judea is the country
of Jerusalem;

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:38.300
Samaria is actually another
part here, but you have this

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.349
idea that the message is going
out in concentric circles.

00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:44.817
That's why Phillip went--he has
Phillip going to Samaria right

00:45:44.817 --> 00:45:47.717
before Peter goes to the
Gentiles with--Cornelius in

00:45:47.717 --> 00:45:48.570
chapter 10.
 

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.489
In chapter 8,
Phillip goes to Samaria and

00:45:51.489 --> 00:45:55.108
then chapter 10 Peter goes--
and then so Gentiles--then you

00:45:55.108 --> 00:45:59.530
have the Gentiles,
and you have Rome as where the

00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:01.150
book ends up.
 

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:05.880
Rome sort of representing
symbolically the very ultimate

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:07.599
ends of the earth.
 

00:46:07.599 --> 00:46:11.143
This is the whole world so
why--by looking at the details

00:46:11.143 --> 00:46:14.875
we can tell that the Luke is not
telling us what happened by

00:46:14.875 --> 00:46:17.469
chronological or historical
accuracy.

00:46:17.469 --> 00:46:20.539
He puts it in an order--even in
the order he puts it,

00:46:20.539 --> 00:46:23.467
even the outline on his books
because he wants to have this

00:46:23.467 --> 00:46:25.889
message of the Gospel centering
on Jerusalem,

00:46:25.889 --> 00:46:28.489
that's why the whole first part
of Luke centers in--

00:46:28.489 --> 00:46:30.862
that's why he has ten full
chapters on the journey to

00:46:30.862 --> 00:46:31.409
Jerusalem.
 

00:46:31.409 --> 00:46:34.938
He wants to focus your
attention on Jerusalem--through

00:46:34.938 --> 00:46:36.469
the book, the Gospel.
 

00:46:36.469 --> 00:46:39.757
But then what he does is once
you're in Jerusalem he focuses

00:46:39.757 --> 00:46:42.710
your attention on the fact that
the Gospel goes beyond

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:43.489
Jerusalem.
 

00:46:43.489 --> 00:46:50.739
One last thing,
look at Luke 21:20-27.

00:46:55.889 --> 00:46:59.117
We'll unpack a lot of this much
more--next time when we talk

00:46:59.117 --> 00:47:02.456
about both Luke and Acts as far
as what are the major thematic

00:47:02.456 --> 00:47:03.769
issues in these two.
 

00:47:07.969 --> 00:47:12.032
I'll start in again next time
with this, or I'll reiterate

00:47:12.032 --> 00:47:15.809
this, but just to get you
thinking look at Luke 21.

00:47:15.809 --> 00:47:17.750
Luke gets this from Mark 13.
 

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.184
Do you remember when we talked
about how could we tell when

00:47:20.184 --> 00:47:22.746
Mark was written because it has
this abomination of desolation

00:47:22.746 --> 00:47:25.503
being set up in the temple,
which probably refers

00:47:25.503 --> 00:47:29.271
to--recalls this idea of the
profanation of the temple by

00:47:29.271 --> 00:47:31.931
Antiochus IV Epiphanes,
but Mark believed it was going

00:47:31.931 --> 00:47:33.639
to happen in the future,
probably by the Romans.

00:47:33.639 --> 00:47:35.452
Right after that happens then
the Messiah comes,

00:47:35.452 --> 00:47:37.614
you have all these terrible
things happen and the Messiah

00:47:37.614 --> 00:47:38.000
comes.
 

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.304
Luke is using Mark as his
source, Mark 13,

00:47:40.304 --> 00:47:42.159
but notice how Luke changes it.
 

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:45.978
Verse 20, "When you see
Jerusalem surrounded by

00:47:45.978 --> 00:47:48.599
armies,"
that's not in Mark.

00:47:48.599 --> 00:47:50.744
When you see Jerusalem
surrounded by armies,

00:47:50.744 --> 00:47:53.039
then know that its desolation
has come near.

00:47:53.039 --> 00:47:54.739
Then those in Judea must flee
to the mountains,

00:47:54.739 --> 00:47:56.847
those inside the city must
flee, for these are the days of

00:47:56.847 --> 00:47:58.356
vengeance--
I'm going quickly through this,

00:47:58.356 --> 00:47:59.480
you'll have to read over it
yourself.

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.771
Look at verse 24,
"They will fall by the

00:48:01.771 --> 00:48:04.534
edge of the sword,"
so the Jews will be defeated,

00:48:04.534 --> 00:48:05.159
he says.
 

00:48:05.159 --> 00:48:07.695
Not only do you have Jerusalem
surrounded by the Roman army,

00:48:07.695 --> 00:48:09.760
but you have them defeated,
fall by the sword.

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.463
"They will be taken away
as captives among all

00:48:12.463 --> 00:48:13.329
nations."
 

00:48:13.329 --> 00:48:15.550
Yes, the Jews were taken as
slaves to Rome,

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:18.880
and then they were sold off and
dispersed throughout the nations

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:19.619
as slaves.
 

00:48:19.619 --> 00:48:23.545
"And Jerusalem will be
trampled on by the Gentiles

00:48:23.545 --> 00:48:27.469
until the times of the Gentiles
are fulfilled."

00:48:27.469 --> 00:48:32.409
None of that was in Luke's
source of Mark.

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:35.509
This tells us that Luke is
writing after the destruction of

00:48:35.509 --> 00:48:37.860
Jerusalem because he tells you
it happens.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.264
It even says that there's going
to be a time of the Gentile

00:48:41.264 --> 00:48:42.789
domination of Jerusalem.
 

00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:46.809
If you read on it's only after
that that you have the Messiah

00:48:46.809 --> 00:48:50.829
coming on the clouds then as--he
picks up again the story.

00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:54.228
Notice all over Luke and Acts,
we can tell by looking at his

00:48:54.228 --> 00:48:56.130
sources, his editing procedure.
 

00:48:56.130 --> 00:49:00.396
Luke was written sometime after
the destruction of Jerusalem,

00:49:00.396 --> 00:49:03.739
and the time he's telling this
story is here.

00:49:03.739 --> 00:49:05.170
What's that time?
 

00:49:05.170 --> 00:49:09.960
"the time of the
Gentiles."

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.500
Any questions?
 

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.880
See you next time.

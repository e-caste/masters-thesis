00:00:01.767 --> 00:00:03.867
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: OK, so
we're ready for a new

00:00:03.867 --> 00:00:07.667
phase here, to talk about
spectroscopy, the interaction 

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.867
of light with matter and what it
can 

00:00:09.867 --> 00:00:11.233
tell us about molecules. 

00:00:13.933 --> 00:00:17.067
We'll talk today about
electronic and infrared 

00:00:17.067 --> 00:00:22.233
spectroscopy, and in particular,
with infrared 

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:26.167
spectroscopy, about normal modes
and the mixing and 

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.333
independence of vibrations. 

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:34.300
So the purposes we use
spectroscopy for are to 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.233
determine structure and to study
dynamics. 

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:42.167
So we use electronic
spectroscopy that's visible and

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:47.700
UV, where it's motion of
electrons that's being excited 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.900
by the light. 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.233
Or vibrational, where it's
motion of the nuclei, the 

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:55.267
atoms, being excited by the
light. 

00:00:55.267 --> 00:00:59.667
Or NMR, where it's a magnetic
interaction with 

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:00.967
light that's involved. 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.800
Spectroscopy comes from the word
specter. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.267
In 1605 it was used, according
to the Oxford English 

00:01:10.267 --> 00:01:11.767
Dictionary. 

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:15.133
to be straunge sights, visions
and apparitions, so that's 

00:01:15.133 --> 00:01:17.700
like the specters of ghosts,
right? 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.733
Or Newton used it in the 1670s
to be Sunbeams...

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.767
passing through
a glass prism...

00:01:23.767 --> 00:01:27.133
exhibited there a spectrum of
diverse colors... so this 

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.600
kind of ghost. So that's where
the word comes from. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.333
Now Atom in a Box, which we
used last semester and it's 

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.800
shown over on this screen, can
be used to 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.367
show a number of things. 

00:01:37.367 --> 00:01:41.200
It can show spectral transitions
for the H atom. 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.100
Let's get this here. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.767
And if you click spectrum here,
you get-- 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.133
where is it now? 

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:55.633
I think it's off the screen. 

00:01:55.633 --> 00:01:57.167
I enlarged things here. 

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:01.867
But anyhow, it gives you what
the spectral transitions are, 

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:04.500
what energies are involved in
going from one-- oh, I think 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.767
it's because I didn't get
simplified at work here. 

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:09.733
What's going on? 

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.000
Why isn't it simplifying? 

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:21.467
My guess is because I blew this
up to be on the screen. 

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:22.167
It's not showing. 

00:02:22.167 --> 00:02:24.467
Anyhow, we've done that before
and seen that you can 

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:28.167
see the energy levels of
different things, different 

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:31.467
atomic levels and the wavelength
that's involved. 

00:02:31.467 --> 00:02:34.267
We can see the static shift in
electron density, from if 

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:37.500
mixing 2s with 2p orbitals. 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.700
Maybe I'm going to have to bring
this back down again, 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.033
and see if it works now. 

00:02:52.267 --> 00:02:55.733
I don't know why it's not
working. 

00:02:55.733 --> 00:02:58.100
Well, fortunately, the most
important stuff I'm going to 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.733
have is A, displaying there, and
B, also on the PowerPoint, 

00:03:02.733 --> 00:03:05.167
so you can do this on your own
time. 

00:03:05.167 --> 00:03:08.167
OK, you can see the shift, as we
saw last semester, from 

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:09.900
mixing 2s with 2p. 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.600
Remember, that'll shift the
electrons from one side to the 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.567
other of the nucleus, depending
on the hybridization. 

00:03:16.567 --> 00:03:20.167
We can see the oscillation of
electron density that comes 

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:23.900
from mixing orbitals with
different energy, and that's 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.167
what's involved here. 

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:30.400
You'll notice over here, we've
got a mixture of the 1s with a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.000
2p orbital. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.533
What we showed before was fixed
in time, and it would 

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:39.000
shift it up or down. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.767
But if you look at it as time
goes on, you see that it 

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:47.700
actually goes back and forth
between being down and being 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.600
up, being down and being up. 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.333
So the electrons, when you mix
1s and 2p, oscillate up and 

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.100
down in time. 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.033
And that's because of a change
in relative phase with time. 

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:04.700
You add s with p, and then
subtract s with p, and it goes

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.300
one way and then the other. 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.767
And I'm going to illustrate
that. 

00:04:08.767 --> 00:04:11.333
This is a feature of
time-dependent quantum 

00:04:11.333 --> 00:04:15.167
mechanics, where the phase of
the wave function changes at a 

00:04:15.167 --> 00:04:17.167
rate proportional to its energy.

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:18.700
And I'll go through this just a
little 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.567
bit on the next slide. 

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:21.867
We're not going to spend too
much time on it, because it's 

00:04:21.867 --> 00:04:23.600
not really the business of this
class. 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.233
But it's so neat that I thought
you'd like 

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:26.967
to know about it. 

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:30.067
But anyhow, when you have the
electron shifting up and down 

00:04:30.067 --> 00:04:32.700
like that, it's like an antenna.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.000
It gives off light. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.767
In fact, it can absorb light,
too. 

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:41.033
Antennas can either transmit or
receive. 

00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:45.367
So that's what allows electrons
in atoms to interact 

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:49.300
with light as an oscillating
dipole. 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.400
You can also do breathing by
mixing 1s with 2s, but that 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.200
doesn't interact with light,
because it 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.700
doesn't generate a dipole. 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.800
And I'm going to illustrate
that. 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.900
So here's 1s, mixing
1s and 2p.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.233
So as we see here, if 2p is
both up and down, but with 

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:13.933
opposite phases, 1s is a single
phase, a single sign. 

00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:17.067
If you add the two, it
reinforces above. 

00:05:17.067 --> 00:05:18.967
OK, and we've seen that before.

00:05:18.967 --> 00:05:20.733
But if you make it time
dependent-- 

00:05:20.733 --> 00:05:22.933
that's what's being shown over
there-- 

00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:28.400
then what happens in time, is
that it goes up and down. 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.600
it's And the oscillation
frequency, how rapidly it goes 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.633
up and down, that is what color
of light would interact 

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:37.567
with it, what frequency of
light, has to do with the 

00:05:37.567 --> 00:05:42.133
energy difference between
1s and 2p.

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:43.600
So here, this is just a
footnote. 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.167
You're not deeply responsible
for this, but I 

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:47.967
wanted you to see it. 

00:05:47.967 --> 00:05:49.500
So I'll just read it to you. 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.900
A time-dependent wave function
looks just like the 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.433
psi's we've been talking about,
functions of position. 

00:05:56.433 --> 00:05:58.233
Except that it's also got
something to 

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:00.300
do with time, obviously. 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.867
It's multiplied by e to the i
omega t. 

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:11.633
And you know e to the ix is
cos x + i sin x. 

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:12.867
Have you done that? 

00:06:12.867 --> 00:06:15.500
I think you may have seen that.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.867
So you have a cosine and a sine
of omega t, one is real 

00:06:19.867 --> 00:06:21.100
and one is imaginary. 

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.100
It's a complex number that
you're multiplying the wave 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.500
function by. 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.367
So i is a square root of -1. 

00:06:27.367 --> 00:06:30.800
Omega is the energy in frequency
units. 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:36.167
That's how rapidly things are
changing in time, because it's 

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:38.200
cos omega t. 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.833
So as time increases, the cosine
goes up between plus 

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:44.100
and minus one. 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.633
And how fast it goes up and down
depends on how big omega 

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:53.133
is, because omega t is what
you're taking the cosine of. 

00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:57.667
So the higher frequency omega
is, the faster it'll go up and 

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.767
down, the higher energy
omega is.

00:07:01.767 --> 00:07:06.533
And now that's an interesting
question, because it depends 

00:07:06.533 --> 00:07:10.467
on what-- the magnitude of the
energy for any given system-- 

00:07:10.467 --> 00:07:15.567
depends on where you define 0 to
be. 

00:07:15.567 --> 00:07:18.667
If you to define 0 to be
separated particles, that's 

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:19.667
one energy. 

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:21.767
If you define it to be the
ground state, that's a 

00:07:21.767 --> 00:07:22.833
different energy. 

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:25.667
And this would suggest that the
rate of oscillation 

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:28.467
depends on what you call 0. 

00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:29.833
That seems nuts, right? 

00:07:29.833 --> 00:07:33.333
It can't depend on you, what the
rate of oscillation is. 

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:36.600
And the reason is, you don't
care what the rate of 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.200
oscillation is. 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.233
And I'll show you why. 

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:43.267
Because when you square the wave
function to get the 

00:07:43.267 --> 00:07:48.800
probability density, at any
given time, you multiply psi 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.733
times e to the i omega t,
times psi to the e to the

00:07:52.733 --> 00:07:54.133
-i omega t. 

00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:57.400
That's how you do squaring with
complex numbers, multiply 

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.600
by the complex conjugate. 

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.000
And that gives psi squared. 

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.733
All the stuff about time cancels
out. 

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.067
So you don't really care. 

00:08:06.067 --> 00:08:09.133
So why do you have it in there
in the first place? 

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:13.667
If you're mixing two different
states that have different 

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:16.900
energy, then they oscillate at
different frequencies. 

00:08:19.967 --> 00:08:22.667
So really, you don't care how
fast either one 

00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:25.133
is oscillating alone. 

00:08:25.133 --> 00:08:28.867
You only care what the
difference in frequencies is. 

00:08:28.867 --> 00:08:31.533
So now it doesn't depend on what
you call 0, because the 

00:08:31.533 --> 00:08:34.967
one state you're taking and the
other state you're taking 

00:08:34.967 --> 00:08:38.767
have the same difference,
whatever 0 is. 

00:08:38.767 --> 00:08:39.767
That's where you make a
difference. 

00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:43.267
So it says, when a problem
involves actually mixing two 

00:08:43.267 --> 00:08:46.700
states of different energy, one
considers a wave function 

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:52.367
of the form, e to the i omega
1t, plus a different psi, the 

00:08:52.367 --> 00:08:56.400
other wave function, times e to
the I omega 2t. 

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.067
Now, if omega 1 and omega 2
are different, this means that 

00:09:01.067 --> 00:09:05.567
the two spatial functions cycle
in and out of phase with 

00:09:05.567 --> 00:09:06.200
one another. 

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:10.700
If at a certain time they add at
a time 1/2 divided by the 

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.533
difference in frequency later,
they subtract. 

00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:17.467
So 1s + 2pz will become
1s - 2pz.

00:09:17.467 --> 00:09:22.567
So if this is the energy here,
the oscillation frequency of 

00:09:22.567 --> 00:09:27.633
2pz, then 1s will have a lower
oscillation frequency, by that 

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:30.033
energy difference between them.

00:09:30.033 --> 00:09:32.233
And it'll look like that. 

00:09:32.233 --> 00:09:35.567
So here, they're in phase with
one another, the cosine part, 

00:09:35.567 --> 00:09:37.067
they're adding. 

00:09:37.067 --> 00:09:39.400
But in the middle there, they're
out of phase, and it's 

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.667
subtracting. 

00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:44.500
And then it comes back into
phase again at the far right. 

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:50.267
So as time goes along, it comes
s+p, s-p, s+p, s-p,

00:09:50.267 --> 00:09:55.467
and the electrons go up
and down. 

00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:58.733
So if you mix these two
orbitals-- 

00:09:58.733 --> 00:10:04.467
so an electric field that's
oscillating up and then down 

00:10:04.467 --> 00:10:07.933
and then up and then down favors
this at the first time, 

00:10:07.933 --> 00:10:11.767
then plus, then minus, then
plus, then minus. 

00:10:11.767 --> 00:10:14.967
So the light interacts with the
electrons and pushes them 

00:10:14.967 --> 00:10:19.200
up and down, mixing 1s with
2p. 

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.467
Now, if you do that for a while,
and then turn the light 

00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:28.633
off, it may end up being in the
s-p, when it started 

00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:30.567
in the s-p, or vice versa. 

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:33.767
So you can get an absorption, or
indeed, an 

00:10:33.767 --> 00:10:36.767
emission of light, the
interaction with light and 

00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:38.833
things, because of this time
dependence. 

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:42.800
But again this is not really our
business, and you'll see 

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:43.300
that later. 

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:46.333
So this is the source of the
oscillation we observe, when 

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:49.467
superimposing functions of
different n 

00:10:49.467 --> 00:10:51.600
using Atom in a Box, different
energies. 

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.567
So that thing going up and down
over there. 

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.100
And note, just as a footnote to
a footnote, this is 

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.533
different from what we were
doing when we made hybrids. 

00:11:02.533 --> 00:11:04.867
We mixed s with p before. 

00:11:04.867 --> 00:11:08.500
Usually we were mixing 2s with
2p, which have very similar 

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.533
energies, right? 

00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:15.400
But in those cases, we weren't
trying to mix two real states, 

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.800
that's why I said actually up
there. 

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.667
There we were just trying to get
in a reasonable form for a 

00:11:23.667 --> 00:11:27.067
wave function of some particular
energy. 

00:11:27.067 --> 00:11:30.267
But when light is involved, you
actually mix states of 

00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:34.767
different energies, so it's a
different situation. 

00:11:34.767 --> 00:11:37.867
So we've got this oscillation up
and down, which 

00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:39.233
interacts with light. 

00:11:39.233 --> 00:11:40.600
It can generate light. 

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.267
It can absorb light. 

00:11:43.267 --> 00:11:47.700
Now, the 1s to 2p transition
is said to be allowed, because 

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.600
it happens with light. 

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.700
But there are other mixtures
that don't generate light. 

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.567
For example, if you mix
1s with 2s.

00:11:57.567 --> 00:12:00.500
If you add the two, it
reinforces where they're blue, 

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.367
and subtracts when they're red.

00:12:02.367 --> 00:12:06.033
That makes a big circle, a big
sphere. 

00:12:06.033 --> 00:12:09.367
But if you subtract them, make
the one on the left red and 

00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:12.300
add it to the other one, then
they'll reinforce in the 

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:15.700
middle and cancel on the
outside, and it'll be inside. 

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.633
So if you mix those two, you get
this dependence with time. 

00:12:19.633 --> 00:12:20.867
I think it's going to do it. 

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.800
Whoops, I didn't wait long
enough. 

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.833
But what happens, and you can do
it yourself, it goes [makes 

00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:28.067
expanding and contracting
sounds]. 

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.667
It's breathing. 

00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:35.467
But that's not separating the
average position of the 

00:12:35.467 --> 00:12:37.067
nucleus and the electron. 

00:12:37.067 --> 00:12:41.267
It's not going up and down to
make a vector, a light. 

00:12:41.267 --> 00:12:44.700
It's just expanding and
contracting. 

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.233
So that symmetrical breathing
electron-density deformation 

00:12:48.233 --> 00:12:49.867
has no oscillator strength. 

00:12:49.867 --> 00:12:52.800
It doesn't interact with light's
magnetic field. 

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.767
So that transition is said to be
forbidden. 

00:12:55.767 --> 00:12:58.467
You can't cause it to occur with
light. 

00:12:58.467 --> 00:13:02.200
Now, what does this have to do
with organic molecules and the 

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.233
things we were just talking
about, which were polyenes. 

00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:08.333
You remember a bunch of bunch of
double bonds in a row. 

00:13:08.333 --> 00:13:11.433
Well, suppose you have C=X
double bond, and X is some 

00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:16.500
heteroatom, like oxygen or
nitrogen, it's something 

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.000
that has an unshared pair of
electrons. 

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.033
So it has n electrons. 

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:26.167
But it also has a pi* orbital,
a vacant orbital. 

00:13:26.167 --> 00:13:27.700
Now, can you mix those two? 

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.567
What would happen if you mixed
those two orbitals? 

00:13:30.567 --> 00:13:33.800
You could add them together, and
they'd reinforce in the 

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:37.767
top-right and cancel on the
bottom-right. 

00:13:37.767 --> 00:13:40.900
And you get the electrons to
move up. 

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:45.133
And if you changed the sign,
they'd move down, if you 

00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:47.967
subtracted one from the other. 

00:13:47.967 --> 00:13:53.000
So here's a way that light gets
a handle on the electrons 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.333
that are an unshared pair, and
can make them go into pi*, 

00:13:56.333 --> 00:13:58.800
by mixing the sigma,

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:03.833
unshared-pair electrons,
with pi*.

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:09.400
Now, that's neat, because as it
goes up and down you absorb 

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:15.000
light, and the large energy gap
between the unshared pair 

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.133
and pi* means that this
transition occurs 

00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:19.667
at very high frequency. 

00:14:19.667 --> 00:14:21.900
Because remember, the frequency
of cycling in and 

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.533
out of phase is the difference
in the 

00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:25.933
energies of the two things. 

00:14:25.933 --> 00:14:29.067
So if they're fairly far apart,
it'll be a very high 

00:14:29.067 --> 00:14:31.333
frequency of light, not in the
visible. 

00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:35.233
So it's in the ultraviolet. 

00:14:35.233 --> 00:14:38.667
How could you make those two
orbitals closer in energy? 

00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:41.567
The unshared pair you couldn't
do much about, except maybe 

00:14:41.567 --> 00:14:43.233
changing one atom what
is involved,

00:14:43.233 --> 00:14:45.967
oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur,
things like that.

00:14:45.967 --> 00:14:47.700
How could you change the
energy of the

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.233
LUMO in the pi system? 

00:14:51.233 --> 00:14:53.300
Anybody got an idea? 

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.967
So if you put more double bonds
conjugated with it-- 

00:14:57.967 --> 00:15:01.267
remember, the LUMO comes down,
the HOMO comes up. 

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:03.567
So you can bring it closer to
the energy of 

00:15:03.567 --> 00:15:05.767
the unshared pair. 

00:15:05.767 --> 00:15:08.933
If we put more and more double
bonds in there, then the LUMO 

00:15:08.933 --> 00:15:10.500
is going to look like this. 

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.433
It approaches the energy of an
isolated p orbital, so the 

00:15:14.433 --> 00:15:17.300
light will get redder and redder
that interacts. 

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.133
And this makes a lot of
differences as the pi* 

00:15:20.133 --> 00:15:23.333
approaches the energy of the 2p
orbital. 

00:15:23.333 --> 00:15:26.400
So for example, this molecule,
which has an unshared pair on 

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.567
nitrogen here, which could mix
with pi* of this really 

00:15:30.567 --> 00:15:33.167
long conjugated system. 

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:36.467
That's the imine of
retinaldehyde. 

00:15:36.467 --> 00:15:37.867
That's what's in rhodopsin. 

00:15:37.867 --> 00:15:40.467
That's the light sensitive stuff
in your eye. 

00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:44.667
So when light comes in, it
excites this transition, and 

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:47.733
it triggers then to your brain
and so on, because the cis 

00:15:47.733 --> 00:15:53.300
isomer changes to the trans
isomer at this double bond. 

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:57.333
And that's how you see. 

00:15:57.333 --> 00:15:58.067
Incidentally-- 

00:15:58.067 --> 00:16:03.433
that compound, I just put this
in as another footnote: let's 

00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:06.733
not spend time on it-- but this
is the actual report of 

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:10.833
Lindlar's catalyst. Remember,
the poisoned catalyst that'll 

00:16:10.833 --> 00:16:13.200
reduce triple bonds to double
bonds, but won't 

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.800
reduce double bonds. 

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.367
And he said it was in the
context 

00:16:16.367 --> 00:16:17.900
of vitamin A synthesis. 

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.633
During work on the synthesis of
vitamin A, a palladium-lead 

00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:24.667
catalyst was developed, which
one could hydrogenate a triple 

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:28.633
bond without attacking double
bonds already present. 

00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:31.233
But the things he was working on
we're things like this. 

00:16:31.233 --> 00:16:36.767
Really long conjugated things,
like b-carotenyne, which he 

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:40.600
made, which had a triple bond in
the middle, as you see. 

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.333
And then he could react it with
his special catalyst and 

00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:48.333
get the cis addition of two
hydrogens to give the 

00:16:48.333 --> 00:16:49.967
b-carotene. 

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:55.667
And he says the hydrogens are
added in cis arrangement to 

00:16:55.667 --> 00:16:58.633
one another. 

00:16:58.633 --> 00:17:03.467
But then he goes on to say that
he could, with heated 

00:17:03.467 --> 00:17:07.233
and light he was able
quantitatively to convert the 

00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:10.033
cis isomer into the trans
isomer, which is what he 

00:17:10.033 --> 00:17:11.267
wanted to have for b-carotene.

00:17:13.867 --> 00:17:18.333
OK, now notice, this was C40H56,
this big long thing. 

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:21.467
And you know why it's that kind
of number, because it's 

00:17:21.467 --> 00:17:24.633
made up of these isoprene units
that we talked about in 

00:17:24.633 --> 00:17:28.033
the last quarter, polymerization
of isoprene to 

00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:31.233
give these natural products. 

00:17:31.233 --> 00:17:34.000
OK, that's just a footnote to
last semester, it's made from 

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.533
isopentenyl pyrophosphate. 

00:17:37.533 --> 00:17:42.467
Now, retinal is the stuff that's
involved in making this 

00:17:42.467 --> 00:17:45.633
visual pigment. 

00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:48.267
And b-carotene is that, and
obviously, it's called 

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:51.000
b-carotene because that's what
makes carrots that way. 

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.200
And that's why you eat carrots
to make your eyes good, right? 

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:59.533
Bugs Bunny has good vision
because of that. 

00:17:59.533 --> 00:18:05.700
Now, this related compound is
called isozeaxanthin. 

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:10.367
And it turns out to be the stuff
that's in the feathers 

00:18:10.367 --> 00:18:13.033
of the scarlet tanager. 

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:18.467
Now, what's weird about this,
it's what makes the scarlet 

00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:22.600
tanager yellow-green, right? 

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.533
What's wrong with that? 

00:18:24.533 --> 00:18:27.467
It's supposed to be a scarlet
tanager. 

00:18:27.467 --> 00:18:30.300
But this is actually late in the
fall. 

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.267
If you looked a little bit
earlier in the fall, the 

00:18:33.267 --> 00:18:36.167
Scarlet Tanager looks like this.

00:18:36.167 --> 00:18:39.833
So it's got a little bit of red
in it. 

00:18:39.833 --> 00:18:43.933
But notice that this OH out on
the right, which has an 

00:18:43.933 --> 00:18:48.900
unshared pair that could go into
the pi system, that 

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.467
oxygen is not part of the
pi system.

00:18:51.467 --> 00:18:55.767
You can't generate any overlap
by that, because the oxygen is 

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:57.700
not where the pi system is. 

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.367
It's not conjugated. 

00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:02.767
The OH unshared pair is
isolated, so you can't do this 

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:06.967
thing of taking an unshared pair
and putting it into the 

00:19:06.967 --> 00:19:10.300
LUMO, the pi LUMO. 

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:15.167
But if you oxidize it to make
that, then you get it 

00:19:15.167 --> 00:19:20.367
conjugated, and that's the
scarlet tanager in the summer. 

00:19:20.367 --> 00:19:24.000
So it's exactly this changing of
unshared pairs into the pi 

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.267
star orbital with a really long
conjugated chain that 

00:19:27.267 --> 00:19:30.400
gives this most vivid of our
birds' colors. 

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.167
And these come in East Rock Park
about a month or month 

00:19:33.167 --> 00:19:35.733
and a half from now, so you can
go see them yourselves. 

00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:38.800
They knock your eyes out. 

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.933
OK, so we're talking about
spectroscopy. 

00:19:40.933 --> 00:19:44.600
A spectrum is usually presented
as a graph. 

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.133
And when you see a graph you
wonder what the axes are. 

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:49.300
That's the first thing. 

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.467
And depending on what point of
view you're taking about

00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:55.300
spectroscopy, how you're
understanding it there are

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.200
different ways of labeling the
graph. 

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.767
For example the horizontal and
the vertical coordinates here 

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:04.367
in this particular graph are
called wave number and 

00:20:04.367 --> 00:20:09.467
transmittance, but the meaning
of the axes, with respect to 

00:20:09.467 --> 00:20:14.600
an experiment, is color, which
light you're talking about 

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.467
along the horizontal axis, and
vertically, what the light 

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:19.467
intensity is. 

00:20:19.467 --> 00:20:23.733
For example, how much light of a
certain color gets absorbed 

00:20:23.733 --> 00:20:24.867
by your sample. 

00:20:24.867 --> 00:20:28.433
Or on the other hand, how much
light doesn't get absorbed and 

00:20:28.433 --> 00:20:30.267
gets through the sample. 

00:20:30.267 --> 00:20:33.400
And in fact, that's what's
plotted here is transmitance, 

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.300
how much light gets through
rather than 

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.167
how much gets absorbed. 

00:20:38.167 --> 00:20:40.000
OK, so that's one way of looking
at it, just 

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.133
experimentally. 

00:20:41.133 --> 00:20:42.767
But another way is to look at it
in 

00:20:42.767 --> 00:20:45.467
terms of quantum mechanics. 

00:20:45.467 --> 00:20:50.367
The horizontal axis is the
molecular-energy gap. 

00:20:50.367 --> 00:20:53.400
What are the orbitals that are
involved? 

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.400
How far apart are they in
energy? 

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.267
What does that have to do with
the frequency of light? 

00:20:58.267 --> 00:21:01.167
You remember, the rate of this
oscillation back and forth has 

00:21:01.167 --> 00:21:03.300
to do with the energy difference
between the two 

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:05.133
states you're talking about. 

00:21:05.133 --> 00:21:08.333
And if you're talking about
quantum mechanics, the 

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:11.933
vertical axis is how much
overlap you generate. 

00:21:11.933 --> 00:21:16.867
So when that oxygen had the pi
system on it, in the scarlet 

00:21:16.867 --> 00:21:21.000
tanager, then you generated a
lot of overlap by mixing the n

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.167
with the pi. 

00:21:22.167 --> 00:21:25.800
But if they were far apart and
the light couldn't induce 

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.333
overlap, then you didn't get the
fancy color. 

00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:32.533
You got just the yellow-green
color. 

00:21:32.533 --> 00:21:35.700
Or you can look at it in terms
of classical mechanics, which 

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.333
is the way we usually talk about
infrared spectroscopy, 

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:42.600
where the horizontal axis is
some actual vibration 

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.833
frequency of the atoms in a
molecule. 

00:21:45.833 --> 00:21:50.967
And the vertical axis is how
much handle the light has on 

00:21:50.967 --> 00:21:52.900
that particular vibration. 

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:56.633
For example, if you're vibrating
H2, you don't change 

00:21:56.633 --> 00:21:58.567
any electronics by doing that. 

00:21:58.567 --> 00:21:59.967
You don't generated a dipole. 

00:21:59.967 --> 00:22:01.633
It doesn't interact with light.

00:22:01.633 --> 00:22:05.667
But if you vibrate HCl, then you
get a big separation of 

00:22:05.667 --> 00:22:08.233
positive and negative charge as
you do that, and it does 

00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:09.200
interact with light. 

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.767
Light has a good handle on it. 

00:22:14.067 --> 00:22:17.233
So it's molecular vibration
frequency though-- 

00:22:17.233 --> 00:22:22.867
of course, a molecule of H2 or
HCl is just two atoms. But 

00:22:22.867 --> 00:22:25.633
normally, the atoms whose bond
you're interested in 

00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:29.133
vibrating is part of a whole
molecule, and then things get 

00:22:29.133 --> 00:22:32.467
more complicated. As we will
see. 

00:22:32.467 --> 00:22:36.433
So infrared spectroscopy uses
light 

00:22:36.433 --> 00:22:37.667
for a number of purposes. 

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:39.700
One is to fingerprint molecules.

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:42.133
And I think you've done this in
lab, to see whether your 

00:22:42.133 --> 00:22:44.800
spectrum corresponds with a
known spectrum. 

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.800
Or even if you don't have an
authentic sample, you may have 

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.000
a table of where functional
groups, even in different 

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.667
molecules, if it's the same
functional group there maybe 

00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:58.733
some line that's characteristic.

00:22:58.733 --> 00:23:01.633
So you can identify functional
groups and molecules that are 

00:23:01.633 --> 00:23:03.900
otherwise unknown. 

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:09.867
And you can also use it to use
the molecular dynamics that's 

00:23:09.867 --> 00:23:14.200
involved to study bonding, to
see how strong bonds are, 

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.433
whether atoms are linked by
springs, for example. 

00:23:17.433 --> 00:23:20.033
And that's what I'm going to
concentrate on in the lecture, 

00:23:20.033 --> 00:23:22.067
to use it to understand
molecules. 

00:23:22.067 --> 00:23:25.267
You you've used it in lab to
identify molecules, to 

00:23:25.267 --> 00:23:28.000
identify functional groups, but
we're going to use this 

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.567
last thing to see what it tells
us about how molecules 

00:23:30.567 --> 00:23:31.967
hold together. 

00:23:31.967 --> 00:23:36.633
Now, just a quick excursion into
physics or math, to see 

00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:39.400
what makes vibrations
sinusoidal. 

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.967
When things vibrate we often
think of them following 

00:23:41.967 --> 00:23:47.167
a sine wave. But what is the
condition under which they do 

00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:51.100
actually vibrate according to a
sine wave in time? 

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:56.700
So if it's vibrating according
to a sine wave, then the 

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:02.967
displacement is some height
times the sin of omega t. 

00:24:02.967 --> 00:24:04.933
That's how fast it's going up
and down. 

00:24:04.933 --> 00:24:07.867
That describes the displacement.

00:24:07.867 --> 00:24:10.567
So that's the frequency, and t
is the time, and 

00:24:10.567 --> 00:24:11.767
h is the 1/2 amplitude. 

00:24:11.767 --> 00:24:14.600
It can go from +1 to -1 as the
sine 

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.567
goes back and forth. 

00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:19.367
OK, and that says the velocity,
the change in 

00:24:19.367 --> 00:24:23.100
position with time, is the
derivative of 

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:25.900
that, so the cosine. 

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.767
And the acceleration is the
second 

00:24:29.767 --> 00:24:33.133
derivative, so it's that. 

00:24:33.133 --> 00:24:36.433
And from that then, if the
motion is sinusoidal, as we 

00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:39.767
said at the beginning, then the
acceleration divided by 

00:24:39.767 --> 00:24:42.967
the displacement is minus the
frequency squared. 

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.167
Now, Newton said that
acceleration 

00:24:50.167 --> 00:24:52.333
is force over mass. 

00:24:52.333 --> 00:24:57.000
And if things are obeying
Hooke's Law, then the force is 

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.367
proportional to the
displacement. 

00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:02.667
And that means we can substitute
in Newton with the 

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:12.333
force, -fx, and we get that
a/x is -f/m. 

00:25:12.333 --> 00:25:16.000
And a/x, we already knew, is
-omega squared. 

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.600
And that means that the
frequency squared is how 

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.600
strong the spring is, if it's
Hooke's law, the force constant

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.867
divided by the mass. 

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.867
Or, if we take the square root,
the frequency is the 

00:25:29.867 --> 00:25:34.700
square root of the force
constant divided by the mass. 

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.500
So the frequency then is
interesting. 

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:39.833
It's constant. 

00:25:39.833 --> 00:25:44.767
It doesn't depend on the
amplitude of the vibration. 

00:25:44.767 --> 00:25:48.767
If you have a system that's
obeying Hooke's law, it'll 

00:25:48.767 --> 00:25:52.533
have the same frequency no
matter what the amplitude. 

00:25:52.533 --> 00:25:54.733
And that turned out to be very
important. 

00:25:54.733 --> 00:25:58.200
Incidentally, one of the texts
we're involved in says the 

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.500
opposite, but it's not true. 

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.133
OK, so why is that so important?

00:26:04.133 --> 00:26:08.867
Hooke's law, Hooke's book, Of
spring in 1678, says 

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:12.100
vibrations, if you're obeying
Hooke's Law-- this is where he 

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.667
set out Hooke's law-- 

00:26:13.667 --> 00:26:16.600
shall be of equal duration
whether they 

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.667
be greater or less. 

00:26:18.667 --> 00:26:24.933
Why did he care that the
frequency be always the same 

00:26:24.933 --> 00:26:28.600
no matter how big the
displacement is? 

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.267
Can you see why that would make
a difference, 

00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:31.500
practically? 

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:31.833
Ellen? 

00:26:31.833 --> 00:26:33.233
STUDENT: For clocks. 

00:26:33.233 --> 00:26:34.500
PROFESSOR: For clocks. 

00:26:36.733 --> 00:26:40.733
Or more particularly, for
watches, because you know, 

00:26:40.733 --> 00:26:45.400
about 90 years or 80 years
later, John Harrison made this 

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:48.367
marine chronometer, which
allowed to solve the problem 

00:26:48.367 --> 00:26:50.200
of longitude. 

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.167
So ships could tell how far they
were from Greenwich by 

00:26:53.167 --> 00:26:54.767
having accurate time. 

00:26:54.767 --> 00:26:58.700
And if you look inside this
watch, it looks like that. 

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.733
There's a spring vibrating like
that. 

00:27:00.733 --> 00:27:02.167
And it's really, really clever.

00:27:02.167 --> 00:27:04.133
I'll show you one other thing
about it. 

00:27:04.133 --> 00:27:08.433
Notice here, there's a little
rod that goes out here under 

00:27:08.433 --> 00:27:09.333
the spring. 

00:27:09.333 --> 00:27:10.967
It's right here. 

00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:14.133
And it goes out until it makes a
little fork 

00:27:14.133 --> 00:27:17.633
there around the spring. 

00:27:17.633 --> 00:27:21.800
Now, that little leaf is
bimetal, so it'll bend with 

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:23.867
temperature. 

00:27:23.867 --> 00:27:28.200
So it changes the length of the
spring as temperature 

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:32.267
changes to correct for the
temperature changing the 

00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:33.900
stiffness of the spring. 

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:36.100
Isn't that clever? 

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.767
OK, that's obviously beside the
point, but it's really a 

00:27:38.767 --> 00:27:43.733
neat feature of Harrison's H4
chronometer. 

00:27:43.733 --> 00:27:47.433
So anyhow, when Hooke's law
applies, the frequency is 

00:27:47.433 --> 00:27:49.967
proportional to the square root
of the force constant 

00:27:49.967 --> 00:27:52.633
divided by the mass. 

00:27:52.633 --> 00:27:54.733
So m is the mass. 

00:27:54.733 --> 00:27:57.700
And this means you could use
this thing 

00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:58.933
to measure the frequency. 

00:27:58.933 --> 00:28:01.867
You could measure a mass that
way. 

00:28:01.867 --> 00:28:05.433
And that's what a quartz crystal
microbalance does. 

00:28:05.433 --> 00:28:07.800
You can have a quartz crystal
that will vibrate. 

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:10.633
I mean, the quartz in my Timex
watch does that, right? 

00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:14.267
It vibrates as a given-- it
keeps very good time. 

00:28:14.267 --> 00:28:19.933
So the quartz crystal
microbalance, if you change 

00:28:19.933 --> 00:28:24.567
its mass by absorbing something
on top of the quartz 

00:28:24.567 --> 00:28:26.500
crystal, it'll change its
frequency, and 

00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.667
you can measure it. 

00:28:27.667 --> 00:28:30.767
In fact, it's so sensitive, that
if you coat it with 

00:28:30.767 --> 00:28:35.900
platinum, and then let ethylene
in to absorb on the 

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:38.933
platinum, it'll get heavier and
the 

00:28:38.933 --> 00:28:41.833
frequency will slow down. 

00:28:41.833 --> 00:28:44.700
But if you then admit hydrogen,
the platinum 

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.500
catalyzes the reaction and the
ethane goes off, and you can 

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.800
measure that change of one
monolayer of ethylene on 

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:57.800
platinum by using a quartz
crystal microbalance. 

00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:03.167
That's just a neat feature. 

00:29:03.167 --> 00:29:06.867
So if we're talking not about
what's going on the surface 

00:29:06.867 --> 00:29:10.700
of a quartz crystal, but about
molecules vibrating, then, for 

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.033
atoms, the force constant should
be how 

00:29:13.033 --> 00:29:14.600
stiff the bond is. 

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:19.033
A single bond should be easier
to stretch than a double bond, 

00:29:19.033 --> 00:29:20.233
than a triple bond. 

00:29:20.233 --> 00:29:21.700
But are they really that? 

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:26.267
Is the force constant really
proportional to 1, 2, 3? 

00:29:26.267 --> 00:29:29.167
Is a double bond twice as strong
as a single bond, for 

00:29:29.167 --> 00:29:31.800
this purpose of how rapidly
things vibrate? 

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.067
Or a triple bond three times as
strong? 

00:29:34.067 --> 00:29:37.200
So this is something we can
check by using infrared 

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.667
spectroscopy. 

00:29:38.667 --> 00:29:42.300
Now, with respect to the mass,
things get more complicated, 

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:45.367
because it's not just one atom
that's moving. 

00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:49.833
Usually it would be at least two
atoms that are moving. 

00:29:49.833 --> 00:29:53.400
And then what do you use for the
mass? 

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.367
It turns out, that in a
diatomic, what you use is 

00:29:56.367 --> 00:29:58.533
called the reduced mass. 

00:29:58.533 --> 00:30:02.833
It's the product of the two
masses divided by their sum. 

00:30:02.833 --> 00:30:06.500
And we don't need to go into why
that is. 

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:10.333
But what that means is that that
effective mass-- 

00:30:10.333 --> 00:30:14.700
use the Greek mu, the Greek m,
mu instead of m-- 

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.667
that's dominated by the smaller
mass. 

00:30:18.667 --> 00:30:24.000
Because suppose m2 is
really small.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.767
Then the denominator, for
practical purposes, is m1. 

00:30:28.767 --> 00:30:30.967
m2 has nothing to do with it. 

00:30:30.967 --> 00:30:34.367
But the m1 in the denominator
then cancels out the m1 in the

00:30:34.367 --> 00:30:36.767
numerator, and all you
have is m2.

00:30:36.767 --> 00:30:38.800
So it's the smaller thing that
counts. 

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.100
You'd usually think it would be
the larger thing. 

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.733
OK, so let's look at what that
would be. 

00:30:43.733 --> 00:30:47.067
For example, for hydrogen and
carbon that we're vibrating, 

00:30:47.067 --> 00:30:50.400
it would be 1 x 12/(1+12). 

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.000
Almost 1, right? 

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.767
The 12's almost cancel. 

00:30:54.767 --> 00:30:57.200
If it's carbon-carbon then it's
going to be 

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.600
1/2 of carbon 6. 

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.767
If it's carbon-oxygen it's going
to be 6.9. 

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:05.467
If it's carbon-chlorine it's
8.9. 

00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:07.733
So even when it gets much
heavier, it doesn't make much 

00:31:07.733 --> 00:31:08.667
difference. 

00:31:08.667 --> 00:31:11.600
It's mostly pretty much like
other carbon bonds. 

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:17.400
So what that means is that bonds
involving hydrogen have 

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.867
really, really different
frequencies from those 

00:31:20.867 --> 00:31:26.567
involving not hydrogen, because
it's so much lighter. 

00:31:26.567 --> 00:31:29.867
1 to 6 here, or more. 

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:33.867
So it stands apart, the mass of
hydrogen. 

00:31:33.867 --> 00:31:36.733
Now, how about the bonds then? 

00:31:36.733 --> 00:31:40.333
So C-H then, is proportional to
the square root of a single 

00:31:40.333 --> 00:31:45.133
bond over 0.9, that's
reduced mass.

00:31:45.133 --> 00:31:47.900
And that turns out to be around
3000 wave numbers, or 

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:49.600
10 to the 14th Hz. 

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.700
So that's how fast C-H bonds
vibrate. 

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:59.133
A C-O bond has a heavier mass,
6.9 versus 0.9. 

00:31:59.133 --> 00:32:02.767
If it's a single bond, that's
going to be about 1100 wave 

00:32:02.767 --> 00:32:06.767
numbers, or 3 x 10 to the 13th
Hz. 

00:32:06.767 --> 00:32:10.067
And that, remember, is that what
you put in front in 

00:32:10.067 --> 00:32:10.667
Eyring 

00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:14.100
to get a rate, it's 10 to the
13th, times that equilibrium 

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.000
constant to the transition
state. 

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.067
That's because of this. 

00:32:17.067 --> 00:32:20.167
That's how fast atoms like
carbon and oxygen vibrate. 

00:32:22.933 --> 00:32:26.600
OK, so a C double bond, though,
if a double bond is 

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.400
twice as high as a single bond,
should be 2, the square 

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.433
root of 2/6.9, and that's about
1500. 

00:32:34.433 --> 00:32:36.400
And that's about right. 

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:42.333
And a triple bond is higher
still, with a 3 for the force 

00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:44.833
constant, about 1900. 

00:32:44.833 --> 00:32:48.867
So you can see that if you have
a spectrum, where 3000 is 

00:32:48.867 --> 00:32:54.833
on the left, and 1000 is toward
the right, then you're 

00:32:54.833 --> 00:32:57.667
going to have hydrogens up here,
hydrogens stretching 

00:32:57.667 --> 00:33:01.133
about 3000, and then you're
going to get triple bonds, 

00:33:01.133 --> 00:33:03.767
double bonds, single bonds
involving 

00:33:03.767 --> 00:33:06.067
other atoms, not hydrogen. 

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.433
But it's not that simple,
because a single atom is 

00:33:13.433 --> 00:33:16.467
connected, not to just one other
atom, but others, and 

00:33:16.467 --> 00:33:20.067
they couple with each other. 

00:33:20.067 --> 00:33:23.700
So this, our study of coupled
oscillators is going to 

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.233
illustrate several things. 

00:33:25.233 --> 00:33:28.667
The complexity of what's really
involved in vibration, 

00:33:28.667 --> 00:33:31.100
and why physical chemists
thought at the beginning that 

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.967
it was going to be impossible to
interpret anything in IR 

00:33:34.967 --> 00:33:36.333
spectroscopy. 

00:33:36.333 --> 00:33:39.767
And then the idea of normal mode
analysis, and what a 

00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:46.100
normal mode is, and phase of
mixing, and the possibility of 

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.200
things being independent, so you
can think about a functional 

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:52.967
group having a particular thing,
not being all mixed up 

00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:54.667
with others. 

00:33:54.667 --> 00:33:56.367
So for this purpose we're going
to look at some 

00:33:56.367 --> 00:34:01.000
oscillators, at this particular
thing here. 

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.433
Let's see if I can get this, get
the lights I need here. 

00:34:05.433 --> 00:34:09.800
OK, so here are some things
that'll oscillate. 

00:34:12.367 --> 00:34:16.000
So if I take this, it vibrates
at a certain frequency. 

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.200
It's a spring that's being bent
back and forth, so it's 

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.367
Hooke's law. 

00:34:20.367 --> 00:34:24.900
And that's what I've shown here.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.633
It's a simple oscillator. 

00:34:26.633 --> 00:34:27.800
I bend it. 

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.567
I let it go. 

00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:31.567
It flops back and forth at a
given rate. 

00:34:31.567 --> 00:34:34.333
And we know what that rate's
going to be. 

00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:37.167
The square of the frequency is
going to be whatever the force 

00:34:37.167 --> 00:34:39.400
constant-- how stiff the spring
is-- 

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:42.300
divided by the mass of that
thing up on top, and of the 

00:34:42.300 --> 00:34:44.000
spring itself, of course. 

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.700
OK, that's fine. 

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:50.067
Now, suppose we put a spring in
there as well. 

00:34:54.467 --> 00:34:59.267
But let me hold this one fixed,
or hold this one fixed. 

00:34:59.267 --> 00:35:02.333
And I'm going to do this then. 

00:35:02.333 --> 00:35:05.500
Now, can you tell me whether
that vibration should be 

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.833
faster or slower than it was
when I didn't 

00:35:08.833 --> 00:35:10.067
have the spring there? 

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:16.533
What's the difference? 

00:35:16.533 --> 00:35:20.400
The difference is that now we
have a stronger spring. 

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.167
Everybody see that? 

00:35:21.167 --> 00:35:23.567
Because we've added this spring
to however hard it is 

00:35:23.567 --> 00:35:25.067
to bend that. 

00:35:25.067 --> 00:35:27.700
So it's going to be a higher
frequency. 

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:29.533
And we could time it, and figure
it out. 

00:35:29.533 --> 00:35:34.167
We don't have time to do that,
but it's faster. 

00:35:34.167 --> 00:35:37.067
If it's coupled to a frozen
partner like that-- 

00:35:37.067 --> 00:35:38.467
I'm holding the partner-- 

00:35:38.467 --> 00:35:44.400
then I let it go and it
stretches back and forth, and 

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.233
it has a stronger spring. 

00:35:46.233 --> 00:35:50.733
It's the main spring plus this
little one, plus s. 

00:35:50.733 --> 00:35:55.200
We could couple that in, so
that's easy enough. 

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.567
Now we're going to look at it
when I'm not holding it. 

00:35:58.567 --> 00:36:00.867
It's going to be in-phase
coupling. 

00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:02.900
So they're going to be moving
the same direction. 

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.067
So I move them both out here,
and I let them go, and they go 

00:36:06.067 --> 00:36:07.300
back and forth. 

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:09.667
Now, what should that frequency
be? 

00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.433
Is this spring being stretched?

00:36:12.433 --> 00:36:17.467
No, so it's just as it was
originally. 

00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:23.967
So if we do this and do that,
and let go, then it goes back 

00:36:23.967 --> 00:36:27.767
and forth, not stretching the
spring. 

00:36:27.767 --> 00:36:31.433
Or if you look at the thing as a
whole, there are two weights 

00:36:31.433 --> 00:36:36.700
and two springs being bent, so
it's 2f/2m, but it's the same

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.200
as we started with. 

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.133
Now, the interesting one is to
do out-of-phase coupling, 

00:36:44.133 --> 00:36:47.000
where they don't go in parallel
but antiparallel to 

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.900
one another. 

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.800
Now, what about this situation
here now? 

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:58.667
Is that spring being stretched?

00:36:58.667 --> 00:37:03.133
In fact, it's being stretched
twice as much as it was 

00:37:03.133 --> 00:37:07.367
before, because the middle is
staying in place, and both 

00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:09.667
things are stretching it. 

00:37:09.667 --> 00:37:13.167
So if we do that, if we do this
one. 

00:37:13.167 --> 00:37:15.867
Out-of-phase coupling-- 

00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:19.567
and notice that the center stays
fixed-- 

00:37:19.567 --> 00:37:22.700
now as it does that, we have a
much stronger spring. 

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.967
It's 2s in the middle now. 

00:37:24.967 --> 00:37:27.433
I'm sorry you can't see this
very well, but you can look at 

00:37:27.433 --> 00:37:29.733
what we review. 

00:37:29.733 --> 00:37:32.467
So it's 2s in the middle, so
now frequency is higher. 

00:37:36.167 --> 00:37:39.767
Now, so when the two were
isolated from one another, 

00:37:39.767 --> 00:37:42.267
that is, when we held one fixed
and just looked at one 

00:37:42.267 --> 00:37:44.600
vibrate, all we had was that
little extra spring in the 

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.900
middle, then they would both
vibrate at the 

00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:49.333
same frequency, isolated. 

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:50.100
Can you see it there? 

00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.267
I think you can. 

00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:54.600
Actually, let me just put it on
the other screen and then 

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:55.833
you'll be able to see it. 

00:37:58.933 --> 00:38:00.267
Yeah, OK, good. 

00:38:03.167 --> 00:38:08.267
But once we let them both move
and they couple their motion, 

00:38:08.267 --> 00:38:11.433
then there's an out-of-phase and
an in-phase. One is higher 

00:38:11.433 --> 00:38:15.067
frequency. One doesn't stretch
the spring, the other 

00:38:15.067 --> 00:38:17.567
stretches it twice as much. 

00:38:17.567 --> 00:38:21.433
Does this remind you of anything
you've seen before? 

00:38:21.433 --> 00:38:22.700
That diagram? 

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:27.567
It's the same thing as orbitals
mixing, to give an 

00:38:27.567 --> 00:38:29.067
in-phase and an out-of-phase. 

00:38:29.067 --> 00:38:31.733
The math is just the same. 

00:38:31.733 --> 00:38:35.333
So this is called, either of
these, the in-phase or the 

00:38:35.333 --> 00:38:38.400
out-of-phase, is called a normal
mode. 

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.500
The meaning of it is that in
that pattern of vibration, all 

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:44.333
the atoms are oscillating at the
same 

00:38:44.333 --> 00:38:47.700
frequency in a normal mode. 

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:55.167
It's a lower frequency here and
a higher frequency here, 

00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:57.767
but both atoms are moving in
phase with one another, you 

00:38:57.767 --> 00:39:02.233
know, at the same oscillation
frequency. 

00:39:02.233 --> 00:39:08.667
Now we're going to do another
one, in which-- 

00:39:08.667 --> 00:39:11.767
so they move back and forth at
the same amplitude, the same 

00:39:11.767 --> 00:39:15.067
frequency, or when they started
the same. 

00:39:15.067 --> 00:39:18.833
So that's out-of-phase and this
one was in-phase. 

00:39:18.833 --> 00:39:27.267
Now, notice that if I added
those two together, those two 

00:39:27.267 --> 00:39:30.467
displacements, those two
vibration patterns, I would 

00:39:30.467 --> 00:39:34.633
get something where one moved
and the other didn't. 

00:39:34.633 --> 00:39:37.867
So I could do that. 

00:39:37.867 --> 00:39:41.333
And what I'm saying is, that
that is the sum of the 

00:39:41.333 --> 00:39:47.233
in-phase motion and the
out-of-phase motion. 

00:39:47.233 --> 00:39:50.067
So if I sum them, I get this one
to move and these cancel. 

00:39:53.033 --> 00:39:57.900
So when I let go now, I'm
actually exciting two normal 

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:00.800
modes, the in-phase and the
out-of-phase. 

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.167
Does everybody see what I'm
doing? 

00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:05.267
Because what I've done here is
the sum of the two of them. 

00:40:05.267 --> 00:40:07.367
So now when I let go, something
neat happens.

00:40:16.067 --> 00:40:18.067
STUDENT: That is cool. 

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.267
PROFESSOR: So what's happening?

00:40:23.267 --> 00:40:25.267
STUDENTS: murmurs. 

00:40:25.267 --> 00:40:26.733
PROFESSOR: It's going back and
forth 

00:40:26.733 --> 00:40:30.667
between one vibrating and the
other vibrating. 

00:40:30.667 --> 00:40:32.533
Why? 

00:40:32.533 --> 00:40:36.500
Because those two modes have
different frequencies, and 

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.933
they get in step and then out of
step with one another, and 

00:40:39.933 --> 00:40:43.367
when they're in step with one
another, this one is moving, 

00:40:43.367 --> 00:40:46.967
that's how we started it. And
not this one, and when it's 

00:40:46.967 --> 00:40:50.500
one minus the other it's this. 

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.600
And because they have different
frequencies, they're 

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.933
cycling in and out of phase with
one another. 

00:40:58.767 --> 00:41:00.267
I think that's just so
wonderful. 

00:41:00.267 --> 00:41:04.667
[LAUGHTER] 

00:41:04.667 --> 00:41:07.367
So that's exactly what we were
looking at at the beginning, 

00:41:07.367 --> 00:41:10.500
where things went in and out of
phase with one another, 

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.267
where it was 1s going to 2p. 

00:41:15.367 --> 00:41:17.967
What we started, when we moved
just one of them and held the 

00:41:17.967 --> 00:41:20.700
other one fixed, was a
superposition of two normal 

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.933
modes of different frequency. 

00:41:22.933 --> 00:41:27.433
And then the vibration beats in
and out of phase. 

00:41:27.433 --> 00:41:31.567
So now, what happens, if one of
them's heavy and the other 

00:41:31.567 --> 00:41:34.800
one's-- so then you can't talk
about just one of them 

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.200
vibrating. When they're coupled
this way-- 

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:41.900
but suppose I made one of them
heavier than the other, so it 

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.433
vibrates normally at a very
different frequency. 

00:41:45.433 --> 00:41:46.700
If I can get this on there...

00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:52.700
And now let me move this one. 

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.300
Let me move this one and not
this one. 

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:57.467
And what should happen-- what we
saw before was the 

00:41:57.467 --> 00:42:01.167
vibration goes from there, to
there, to there, to there-- 

00:42:01.167 --> 00:42:03.667
but now look what happens. 

00:42:03.667 --> 00:42:07.600
I actually moved that one a
little bit at the beginning. 

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.200
This one's not moving nearly as
much as that one is. 

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.267
This one keeps moving. 

00:42:11.267 --> 00:42:14.200
Remember, the other one went
dead still and then the other 

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:15.067
one and then the other. 

00:42:15.067 --> 00:42:18.300
Now it's staying localized
mostly. 

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.367
And if I did this one, it stays
mostly here. Very little 

00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:24.667
comes over there. 

00:42:24.667 --> 00:42:29.200
So if the two things have very
different frequencies, then 

00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:32.833
they don't couple very much. 

00:42:32.833 --> 00:42:36.333
They stay mostly independent, if
they have different 

00:42:36.333 --> 00:42:39.667
independent... different
individual frequencies. 

00:42:39.667 --> 00:42:43.900
And that's exactly like the wave
functions mixing. 

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:46.933
If we have one that's low energy
and one that's high 

00:42:46.933 --> 00:42:51.633
frequency, and we couple them,
you'll get one that's in phase 

00:42:51.633 --> 00:42:55.367
and one that's out of phase, but
they won't be very 

00:42:55.367 --> 00:42:56.400
different from one another. 

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.667
It's an exact analogue of the
energy-match and overlap 

00:43:00.667 --> 00:43:03.333
thing, where the energy-match is
now how different the 

00:43:03.333 --> 00:43:08.067
frequencies are, or the
energy-mismatch, and the overlap

00:43:08.067 --> 00:43:11.833
is how strong this spring is
between them.

00:43:11.833 --> 00:43:15.500
So if I make the spring really
strong, then even though they 

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:18.633
have different frequencies,
they'll be more 

00:43:18.633 --> 00:43:20.367
mixed with one another. 

00:43:20.367 --> 00:43:23.633
Now this, it's weird, but this
one is moving more. 

00:43:23.633 --> 00:43:27.000
But if I make it very weak
coupling, like that, then they 

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.467
really stay independent of one
another. 

00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:34.033
So it's a really neat physical
demonstration of what we saw 

00:43:34.033 --> 00:43:35.967
last semester. 

00:43:35.967 --> 00:43:37.500
OK, that's enough of that for
now. 

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.800
If I can get this off. 

00:43:42.733 --> 00:43:45.133
So you can come play with that
afterwards if you want to. 

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:54.100
So vibration remains localized
when the coupling is weak, 

00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:58.300
compared to the energy mismatch.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.667
These illustrate that. 

00:44:01.667 --> 00:44:05.000
So if you have a general
molecule that has N atoms in 

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.667
it, there are 3N independent
geometric parameters, x, y, 

00:44:09.667 --> 00:44:18.467
and z for all the N atoms. But
it takes three numbers to say 

00:44:18.467 --> 00:44:21.567
where the center of the molecule
is. 

00:44:21.567 --> 00:44:24.300
And it takes another three
numbers to tell how much you 

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.200
rotated around this axis, how
much you rotated around this 

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.633
axis, how much you rotated
around this axis, so that's 

00:44:30.633 --> 00:44:33.900
three more numbers to fix the
orientation. 

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:38.900
So you have 3N-6 coordinates
that involve 

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.667
internal vibration. 

00:44:40.667 --> 00:44:43.400
But it's not just two atoms that
are vibrating, it's the 

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:45.700
whole set of atoms that are
vibrating. 

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:49.833
And in a normal mode, they all
vibrate at the same frequency. 

00:44:49.833 --> 00:44:53.633
But there are going to be 3N-6
normal modes, and this 

00:44:53.633 --> 00:44:57.867
is where physical chemists threw
up their hands, and 

00:44:57.867 --> 00:45:01.000
said, it's just so complicated
how all these springs are 

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.400
interacting with each other,
that we're never going to 

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.833
understand it. 

00:45:04.833 --> 00:45:06.367
So forget trying to interpret. 

00:45:06.367 --> 00:45:12.200
OK for a fingerprint, but forget
trying to interpret it. 

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.967
So it sounds hopelessly complex,
though it's good for 

00:45:14.967 --> 00:45:16.300
a fingerprint. 

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:20.033
But remember, to get mixing, you
have to have frequency 

00:45:20.033 --> 00:45:23.733
match and some coupling
mechanism. 

00:45:23.733 --> 00:45:27.133
So if you have some of these
bonds that vibrate without 

00:45:27.133 --> 00:45:30.233
similar frequencies to anything
in the neighborhood, 

00:45:30.233 --> 00:45:33.933
or not coupled to things in the
neighborhood, then they'll 

00:45:33.933 --> 00:45:36.867
appear independently, and you
can hope to identify a 

00:45:36.867 --> 00:45:38.867
particular functional group. 

00:45:38.867 --> 00:45:42.667
So if they're isolated, they're
independent, but if 

00:45:42.667 --> 00:45:45.200
they're coupled, then you see
complication. 

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.533
So it's again this question of
energy-match and overlap. 

00:45:48.533 --> 00:45:53.500
Now let's look at the butane,
C4H10 . 

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:58.933
It's got 42 degrees of freedom,
42 of these, minus 

00:45:58.933 --> 00:46:02.400
the 3 translations and the 3
rotations, so there are 36 

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:06.600
vibrations, 36 normal modes that
are involved. 

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.000
If you just had the four
carbons, there'd be three 

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.900
stretches, two bends and a
twist, the 

00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.667
torsion around the middle. 

00:46:13.667 --> 00:46:16.967
With 10 C-H's, you have 10
stretches, 

00:46:16.967 --> 00:46:19.967
and 20 bends or twists. 

00:46:19.967 --> 00:46:22.733
But it's not that simple,
because they get mixed up, 

00:46:22.733 --> 00:46:26.367
according to frequency-match and
coupling, into 36 

00:46:26.367 --> 00:46:28.267
complicated normal modes. 

00:46:28.267 --> 00:46:30.200
Let's see if we can understand
anything about 

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.067
these normal modes. 

00:46:31.067 --> 00:46:34.933
So here's a spectrum of a
hydrocarbon, it's C8H18. 

00:46:34.933 --> 00:46:38.400
You've seen a spectrum like
this, I bet, in lab. 

00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.933
Let's see if we can understand
what any of the peaks are. 

00:46:40.933 --> 00:46:43.767
First notice, that there are
peaks at the far left, around 

00:46:43.767 --> 00:46:46.833
3000, and the others are all
1500 or below. 

00:46:46.833 --> 00:46:48.600
What do you think's up at the
top, high frequencies? 

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:50.267
STUDENTS: C-H 

00:46:50.267 --> 00:46:51.233
PROFESSOR: C-H's, right. 

00:46:51.233 --> 00:46:53.200
Because the H is so light. 

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:57.167
OK, so there are 72 normal modes
here, but not all of 

00:46:57.167 --> 00:47:01.133
them are IR active with this
C8H18. 

00:47:01.133 --> 00:47:03.300
So let's look at that particular
peak there. 

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.167
There are actually several there
but, anyhow, 

00:47:05.167 --> 00:47:06.533
one of them is this. 

00:47:06.533 --> 00:47:11.867
So there we have a molecule and
here we distort it. 

00:47:11.867 --> 00:47:15.967
Now, tell me what's happening in
the distortion? 

00:47:15.967 --> 00:47:17.233
What's mostly changing? 

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.767
What's mostly changing?

00:47:23.767 --> 00:47:24.967
STUDENTS: C-H bonds.

00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:27.433
PROFESSOR: Yeah, its C-H bonds
are stretching 

00:47:27.433 --> 00:47:29.600
and shrinking, right? 

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.333
And notice the way they're doing
it. 

00:47:32.333 --> 00:47:35.100
Focus on the two central CH2s. 

00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.767
The hydrogens are moving up and
down, up and down. 

00:47:39.767 --> 00:47:44.400
So the charge is moving up and
down, up and down. 

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:48.100
So that's going to interact then
with light, with an 

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:50.833
electric field of light that's
pointing in that way. 

00:47:50.833 --> 00:47:56.667
So light can help push those
four central H's up and down. 

00:47:56.667 --> 00:47:59.200
That particular vibration, that
particular normal mode, 

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.267
interacts with light, and you
get absorption of light at 

00:48:02.267 --> 00:48:03.933
that position. 

00:48:03.933 --> 00:48:05.467
When it's up, it pushes it one
way. 

00:48:05.467 --> 00:48:07.767
When the field is down, it
pushes it the other way, and 

00:48:07.767 --> 00:48:08.800
we interact with light. 

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.200
So that's a C-H stretch. 

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.333
Now, how about this one? 

00:48:12.333 --> 00:48:15.200
Here we have-- or one of the
peaks under there at least-- 

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:17.433
here it's this and then that. 

00:48:17.433 --> 00:48:18.667
What's happening now? 

00:48:21.467 --> 00:48:23.167
What bonds are changing? 

00:48:23.167 --> 00:48:24.633
What kinds of bonds? 

00:48:24.633 --> 00:48:26.267
Is that C-C or C-H? 

00:48:26.267 --> 00:48:28.333
STUDENTS: C-H 

00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:29.967
PROFESSOR: It's C-H. And notice
how 

00:48:29.967 --> 00:48:30.767
they're doing. 

00:48:30.767 --> 00:48:34.667
They're all going in or out
together. 

00:48:34.667 --> 00:48:35.933
So that's going to do it. 

00:48:35.933 --> 00:48:37.867
What direction of the light's
electric 

00:48:37.867 --> 00:48:41.400
vector will excite this? 

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.833
It's going to be perpendicular
to the screen, to push them 

00:48:43.833 --> 00:48:44.900
all in, all out. 

00:48:44.900 --> 00:48:47.400
So it's a different polarization
of the light 

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:48.467
that's going to do this one. 

00:48:48.467 --> 00:48:50.500
It's going to be the light that
goes that way 

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.600
or goes that way. 

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.700
Now there are a lot of others
that we won't go into. 

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:56.700
One of them is this. 

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:58.867
Look at this now. 

00:48:58.867 --> 00:48:59.900
What's happening now? 

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:03.067
Again, we're stretching C-H
bonds. 

00:49:03.067 --> 00:49:05.400
How strongly is this going to
interact with light? 

00:49:10.733 --> 00:49:14.733
Notice, for every H that goes
one way, there's another H that

00:49:14.733 --> 00:49:19.367
goes exactly the opposite way,
so those cancel out and 

00:49:19.367 --> 00:49:21.433
there's no interaction with
light. 

00:49:21.433 --> 00:49:23.867
So that sort of breathing, where
they're all going out 

00:49:23.867 --> 00:49:26.467
and in at the same time doesn't
interact. 

00:49:26.467 --> 00:49:28.333
You don't see that in the IR. 

00:49:28.333 --> 00:49:35.567
So in fact, half of the 10 C-H
stretching normal modes have 

00:49:35.567 --> 00:49:36.867
no handle on them. 

00:49:36.867 --> 00:49:38.933
They don't change the dipole
moment. 

00:49:38.933 --> 00:49:42.200
So they don't absorb light. 

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:44.400
And that's where we're going to
have to stop now and go on 

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:45.833
to the other peaks next time.

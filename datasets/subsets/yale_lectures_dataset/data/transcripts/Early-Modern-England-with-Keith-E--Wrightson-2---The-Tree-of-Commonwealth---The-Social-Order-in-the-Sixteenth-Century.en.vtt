00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:01.850
Prof: Okay.
 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.091
Well this week and next week
I'm going to concentrate on

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:08.052
setting the contexts,
introducing you to the contours

00:00:08.052 --> 00:00:12.693
of an unfamiliar society,
and today I'll start with the

00:00:12.693 --> 00:00:15.477
social order,
how people perceived their

00:00:15.477 --> 00:00:18.800
social world as a whole in the
sixteenth century.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.770
Okay.
 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.629
Well, 500 years ago in the fall
of the year 1509 a man named

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:31.160
Edmund Dudley lay imprisoned in
the Tower of London,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.042
the great royal fortress which
dominated the eastern parts of

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.200
London,
as it still does.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.940
He was there on trumped-up
charges of treason.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.330
Dudley was a lawyer.
 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:49.062
He had assisted King Henry VII
in some very unpopular policies

00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:52.070
and in 1509 the old king died.
 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.285
The new king,
Henry VIII, came to the throne

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:59.697
aged only eighteen and won some
quick popularity by throwing

00:00:59.697 --> 00:01:02.090
Edmund Dudley to the wolves.
 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.763
But as he lay in prison
awaiting execution Dudley made

00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:11.965
his peace with man and God by
writing a book which he called

00:01:11.965 --> 00:01:15.140
The Tree of Commonwealth.
 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.903
It didn't save him and he
probably never expected that it

00:01:19.903 --> 00:01:22.712
would,
but it survived and it remains

00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:26.319
a classic statement of
sixteenth-century social values

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:29.858
and it can serve to introduce
some of the keywords of

00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:31.970
sixteenth-century society.
 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.333
In The Tree of Commonwealth
Dudley attempted as a loyal

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:42.784
subject to describe what he saw
as the ideal conditions for the

00:01:42.784 --> 00:01:47.180
prospering of the kingdom under
its new king,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.709
Henry VIII.
 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:52.938
The word that he used in his
title, "commonwealth,"

00:01:52.938 --> 00:01:56.322
was a real keyword of
sixteenth-century political

00:01:56.322 --> 00:01:57.310
discourse.
 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.640
It meant the body politic,
the whole of the realm.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.608
It also meant the common good,
the common interest,

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:10.788
the public welfare of society.
 

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:14.580
In discussing it,
Dudley, in his book,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.780
took the form of an elaborate
allegory.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.240
He imagined the commonwealth as
a great tree.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.040
There were four roots of
commonwealth:

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.816
love of God,
justice, trust,

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.460
and concord.
 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.723
And there were four fruits of
commonwealth:

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:38.260
tranquility,
good example,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.830
worldly prosperity,
and the honor of God.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.453
Well, the fruits of
commonwealth,

00:02:45.453 --> 00:02:49.470
this happy outcome of
harmonious commonwealth,

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.092
involved the reconciling,
under the guiding hand of the

00:02:53.092 --> 00:02:55.480
king,
of the interests of all the

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.593
principal social groups so that
conflict would be avoided and

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:03.639
everyone would be welded into a
harmonious commonwealth.

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.205
So, in describing the
commonwealth Dudley described

00:03:08.205 --> 00:03:13.044
the various component social
groups and he divided the

00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:17.050
subjects of the realm,
in a way that was very

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.139
conventional,
into what he called three

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:22.998
'estates' or 'orders',
three estates,

00:03:22.998 --> 00:03:26.919
each of which had its role and
each of which had its duties.

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.038
First of all came the clergy.
 

00:03:31.038 --> 00:03:35.610
Their role was to pray for the
good of the whole,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.530
to sustain Christian values by
their pastoral ministry,

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.617
and to avoid the temptations of
worldliness or lusts of the

00:03:44.617 --> 00:03:45.319
flesh.
 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.979
All of this was explained.
 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:51.468
Then he turned to the second
estate, what he called the

00:03:51.468 --> 00:03:52.550
'chivalry'.
 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.045
The chivalry were the lay
elite, ranging in status from

00:03:58.045 --> 00:04:04.560
dukes at the top down to mere
knights, esquires and gentlemen.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.127
All of these people were
considered to be of 'gentle'

00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:09.830
blood.
 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.939
Their duty was to defend the
realm in time of war and to

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.680
govern it justly in time of
peace under the king.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.788
They should avoid the abuse of
their power as governors or as

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:25.810
landlords.
 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.800
They should protect and relieve
the poor and the weak and serve

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.089
the king well.
 

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:36.547
Thirdly, there were those that
Dudley called the 'commonalty'

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:38.850
of the realm:
the commonalty.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.139
And basically that was all the
rest;

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.327
the common people from the
peasantry of the countryside to

00:04:44.327 --> 00:04:46.339
the great merchants of the
cities;

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:49.839
all those who were not of
gentle blood.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:54.187
Their duty was to work,
to get a living that was

00:04:54.187 --> 00:04:59.829
appropriate for their place in
society, to keep their families

00:04:59.829 --> 00:05:02.790
and to support all the rest.
 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:08.149
They were advised by Dudley to
avoid 'covetousness' or greed,

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:13.033
to avoid idleness and to avoid
what he called "presumption

00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:17.329
above their degree";
they should keep their place.

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:20.079
They should also avoid
"grudging and

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:23.242
murmuring"
against the fact that they were

00:05:23.242 --> 00:05:24.824
born,
as he put it,

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:29.026
"to live in labor and pain
and for the most part of their

00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:31.850
time in the sweat of their
face."

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.430
This is excellent advice for
students.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.379
&gt;
 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:41.670
I'll repeat that:
avoid grudging and murmuring,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:47.735
accept that you're here to live
in labor and pain and the most

00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:52.310
part of your time in the sweat
of your face.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.110
Okay.
 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.274
Well, all of this is a
perfectly conventional account

00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:59.680
of the structures and purposes
of the social order in the

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.019
sixteenth century.
 

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:04.793
It's partly descriptive of the
major component groups of

00:06:04.793 --> 00:06:05.480
society.
 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.730
It's partly obviously
prescriptive.

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.579
It's prescribing how they
should live,

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:15.444
and in doing so it embodies the
central ideals of the social

00:06:15.444 --> 00:06:19.507
morality of the time as it was
conceived by people like Dudley:

00:06:19.507 --> 00:06:25.370
harmony,
duty, order.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.269
Now clearly this ideal was
communitarian.

00:06:28.269 --> 00:06:32.435
Dudley was very preoccupied
with the commonwealth as an

00:06:32.435 --> 00:06:36.370
association of interdependent
parts, a community.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.420
But equally clearly it was not
egalitarian.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:45.230
The component groups might be
interdependent but they were

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:47.339
emphatically not equal.
 

00:06:47.339 --> 00:06:50.617
Each group was expected to
contribute "in its

00:06:50.617 --> 00:06:54.485
degree" as Dudley put it;
"in its degree,"

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:56.079
according to its place.
 

00:06:56.079 --> 00:07:00.884
And each group shared in the
benefits of the commonwealth

00:07:00.884 --> 00:07:06.120
"after its degree,"
in accordance with its place.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.833
Now by 'degree' he meant,
of course, the different

00:07:09.833 --> 00:07:14.000
gradations of wealth and status
inside each of the three

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.910
estates.
 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.595
That hierarchical ranking was
fundamental to sixteenth-century

00:07:20.595 --> 00:07:26.095
notions of the social order and
people were never allowed to

00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:27.399
forget it.
 

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:27.810
Okay.
 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:32.211
Well, let's leave Edmund Dudley
meditating in his cell in the

00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:36.173
Tower and imagine ourselves
instead in one of England's

00:07:36.173 --> 00:07:39.550
9,000 parish churches a few
decades later.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.410
It's a Sunday morning.
 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:45.009
The bells are tolling to call
people to church.

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:48.310
The church wardens--who were
kind of like the teaching

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.990
fellows of the sixteenth-century
parish--

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.459
the church wardens are
patrolling the aisles,

00:07:53.459 --> 00:07:55.949
getting people sat in their
proper place,

00:07:55.949 --> 00:08:00.189
gentry up at the front,
the lowly at the back.

00:08:00.189 --> 00:08:03.485
They're chasing out the dogs
because people brought their

00:08:03.485 --> 00:08:06.899
dogs to church in those days and
settling everyone down.

00:08:06.899 --> 00:08:10.930
And once a year the grave,
gray-bearded minister of the

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.963
parish would come into the
pulpit and read out from the

00:08:14.963 --> 00:08:19.144
Book of Homilies. The
Book of Homilies were

00:08:19.144 --> 00:08:23.101
official sermons which were
published by the Church of

00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:27.581
England and were to be read out
periodically in the course of

00:08:27.581 --> 00:08:29.000
the year.
 

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.126
He began thus:
"Almighty God hath created

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:40.181
and appointed all things in
heaven, earth and waters in a

00:08:40.181 --> 00:08:43.428
most excellent and perfect
order.

00:08:43.428 --> 00:08:48.629
In heaven he hath appointed
distinct orders and estates of

00:08:48.629 --> 00:08:50.820
archangels and angels.
 

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.008
In earth he hath assigned
kings, princes with other

00:08:56.008 --> 00:09:00.782
governors under them,
all in good and necessary

00:09:00.782 --> 00:09:01.820
order.
 

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:07.922
Every degree of people in their
vocation, their calling and

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:14.129
their office have appointed to
them their duty and order.

00:09:14.129 --> 00:09:17.899
Some are in high degree,
some in low,

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:23.110
some kings and princes,
some inferiors and subjects,

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.879
priests and laymen,
masters and servants,

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:33.230
fathers and children,
husbands and wives,

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:36.558
rich and poor...
 

00:09:36.558 --> 00:09:42.687
And where there is no right
order there reigneth all abuse,

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:47.336
carnal liberty,
enormity, sin and Babylonical

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:49.450
confusion."
 

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.614
Well, that's the opening
paragraph of the Homily on

00:09:52.614 --> 00:09:55.836
Obedience;
the Homily on Obedience,

00:09:55.836 --> 00:10:00.004
published for the first time in
the 1540s and another neat

00:10:00.004 --> 00:10:04.171
statement of Tudor perceptions
of the social order and its

00:10:04.171 --> 00:10:06.950
emphasis on hierarchy and
degree;

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:12.470
order, the word echoing through
that opening paragraph.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:15.664
Well, put Dudley and the
Homily on Obedience

00:10:15.664 --> 00:10:19.417
together and you've got a
world which certainly had

00:10:19.417 --> 00:10:23.134
certain communitarian ideals,
the commonwealth,

00:10:23.134 --> 00:10:27.754
but one in which it was also
assumed that those ideals were

00:10:27.754 --> 00:10:32.134
best served by maintaining a
sort of graduated ladder of

00:10:32.134 --> 00:10:36.676
authority and subordination
within each one of the degrees

00:10:36.676 --> 00:10:38.110
of society.
 

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.240
And indeed the three degrees as
Dudley described them can be

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.440
shuffled together into a single
rank order of precedence,

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.000
as they were when people went
on processions,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.649
for example.
 

00:10:50.649 --> 00:10:55.517
On the back of your handout
you'll find a chart laying out

00:10:55.517 --> 00:11:00.639
as one hierarchy that classical
social hierarchy which you've

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:05.570
already read about,
I hope, in the chapter set from

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.799
English Society.
 

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:08.788
Okay.
 

00:11:08.788 --> 00:11:13.908
Well, if you think back to what
I've said so far it's clear that

00:11:13.908 --> 00:11:17.808
within all of this they were
making four kinds of

00:11:17.808 --> 00:11:20.408
distinctions between people.
 

00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:23.924
There were distinctions of
function, your role in the

00:11:23.924 --> 00:11:24.940
commonwealth.
 

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:28.899
There were distinctions of rank
and of status.

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:32.803
There were distinctions of
course of gender and there were

00:11:32.803 --> 00:11:37.046
distinctions of age--
parents and children--and many

00:11:37.046 --> 00:11:40.690
of these distinctions tended to
overlap.

00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.168
So I want now to look at them a
little more closely,

00:11:44.168 --> 00:11:47.548
starting by looking at rank and
status,

00:11:47.548 --> 00:11:51.149
the hierarchy that they
emphasize so much--

00:11:51.149 --> 00:11:54.086
and here I'll skip along quite
smartly because you've had a

00:11:54.086 --> 00:11:56.720
chance to read about this
already to some degree,

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.080
but I'll just reinforce some of
the main points.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.340
Okay.
 

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.799
Well, at the top of the social
hierarchy, obviously enough,

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:11.028
stood the king and his
immediate family.

00:12:11.028 --> 00:12:13.476
The king was not only the
greatest of the English

00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:15.005
nobility,
which he was,

00:12:15.005 --> 00:12:18.600
and the greatest single
landowner in the kingdom,

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.395
which he also was,
but he was also something

00:12:22.395 --> 00:12:23.278
special.
 

00:12:23.278 --> 00:12:27.399
The king was the 'anointed of
God' as they put it,

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:31.687
ritually anointed with sacred
oil at the time of the

00:12:31.687 --> 00:12:35.785
coronation;
the fount of all secular

00:12:35.785 --> 00:12:41.458
authority in the realm,
but also considered to be

00:12:41.458 --> 00:12:45.950
ruling by the special grace of
God.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.688
Beneath the crown came Dudley's
chivalry and that was itself

00:12:50.688 --> 00:12:54.783
internally differentiated into,
on the one hand--and your

00:12:54.783 --> 00:12:58.004
handout will help with this--
on the one hand,

00:12:58.004 --> 00:13:01.668
the peerage,
and on the other hand the

00:13:01.668 --> 00:13:02.658
gentry.
 

00:13:02.658 --> 00:13:07.009
The peerage were the greater
nobility.

00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:10.458
They were the nobles who were
distinguished by having

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:14.240
inheritable titles which could
be passed on to their sons:

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.976
dukes,
earls, marquises,

00:13:16.976 --> 00:13:21.230
viscounts, barons,
lords.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:23.889
They also had a favorable
position before the law.

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:27.634
They could only be tried by
their peers, usually in the

00:13:27.634 --> 00:13:30.200
House of Lords when Parliament
sat.

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:36.227
They had the right to sit in
Parliament by virtue of their

00:13:36.227 --> 00:13:39.190
birth and social position.
 

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.048
Alongside those great lay
nobles one can also place some

00:13:43.048 --> 00:13:45.504
of the great churchmen,
the bishops,

00:13:45.504 --> 00:13:48.029
the abbots of great
monasteries.

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:52.587
They also sat in Parliament in
the House of Lords because they

00:13:52.587 --> 00:13:56.039
were the lords of the church--
but an important distinction,

00:13:56.039 --> 00:13:58.918
of course,
was that their positions were

00:13:58.918 --> 00:14:00.350
not inheritable.
 

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.816
They were appointed--in the
early sixteenth century

00:14:03.816 --> 00:14:07.283
appointed by the pope,
though usually on the advice

00:14:07.283 --> 00:14:09.710
and recommendation of the king.
 

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.850
So we've looked at the peerage,
the greater nobility.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.134
Then there was the lesser
nobility which contemporaries

00:14:18.134 --> 00:14:21.149
referred to usually as the
'gentry'.

00:14:21.149 --> 00:14:28.157
They were themselves internally
differentiated into knights,

00:14:28.157 --> 00:14:31.720
esquires and mere gentlemen.
 

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.802
Knights were created by the
monarch for service,

00:14:35.802 --> 00:14:39.971
for service in war,
usually, or in government--as

00:14:39.971 --> 00:14:42.230
indeed they still are.
 

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.462
High-ranking civil servants in
Britain and military officers

00:14:45.462 --> 00:14:49.080
very often get a knighthood at
the end of their active careers,

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:53.035
though the notion of service
has broadened somewhat nowadays

00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:55.450
to include other roles in
society.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.461
So we have Sir Ian McKellen,
also known as Gandalf,

00:14:59.461 --> 00:15:01.629
&gt;.
 

00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:06.046
We have Sir Paul McCartney,
of course, and we even have Sir

00:15:06.046 --> 00:15:08.940
Mick Jagger
&gt;

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.549
, which proves that he was just
a nice boy really all along.

00:15:12.549 --> 00:15:15.870
&gt;
 

00:15:15.870 --> 00:15:19.211
So the appointment of knights,
the 'dubbing' of knights by the

00:15:19.211 --> 00:15:20.908
monarch, continues of course.
 

00:15:20.908 --> 00:15:24.792
In the sixteenth century they
were usually selected to be made

00:15:24.792 --> 00:15:28.673
knights from amongst the leading
families of each of the forty

00:15:28.673 --> 00:15:31.735
counties of the kingdom,
and the title could not be

00:15:31.735 --> 00:15:32.250
inherited.
 

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:36.870
You had to be made a knight
again in each new generation.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:41.361
Below them were the lesser
gentry of esquires and mere

00:15:41.361 --> 00:15:42.379
gentlemen.
 

00:15:42.379 --> 00:15:45.990
They had no title except the
right to be called 'Mister'.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:50.008
Only a gentleman could be
called Mister,

00:15:50.008 --> 00:15:55.470
and they had the right also to
bear a coat of arms.

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:57.554
Collectively,
the nobility,

00:15:57.554 --> 00:16:01.886
both the peerage and the church
leaders and the gentry,

00:16:01.886 --> 00:16:06.298
were the principal landowners
of England and Wales.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:09.548
In the county of North
Yorkshire for example--

00:16:09.548 --> 00:16:11.399
it's up here in the north of
England--

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:14.683
in the early sixteenth century
a study has been done which

00:16:14.683 --> 00:16:17.395
shows that the nobility,
the peerage,

00:16:17.395 --> 00:16:21.616
owned 27% of the land,
the gentry owned 46%,

00:16:21.616 --> 00:16:26.250
and nearly all of the rest
belonged to the church.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:30.549
Land was not only a source of
income, the rents which were

00:16:30.549 --> 00:16:34.774
paid to the great landowners,
but it was also a source of

00:16:34.774 --> 00:16:39.658
power over tenants;
it was a source of' 'lordship',

00:16:39.658 --> 00:16:44.740
as they put it in this period,
lordship over men.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:48.004
Some gentlemen owned only a
single small estate,

00:16:48.004 --> 00:16:51.062
some had many,
and by the time you get to the

00:16:51.062 --> 00:16:54.259
peerage some of them had vast
territories.

00:16:54.259 --> 00:16:57.356
The Earl of Shrewsbury,
whom we'll encounter again at

00:16:57.356 --> 00:16:59.945
various times,
owned a great deal of land in

00:16:59.945 --> 00:17:03.149
the center of England in the
counties of Nottinghamshire,

00:17:03.149 --> 00:17:06.375
Derbyshire and Shropshire,
and he was described at the

00:17:06.375 --> 00:17:09.786
time as being like "a
prince in four counties in the

00:17:09.786 --> 00:17:11.430
heart of England."
 

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:16.278
He was the biggest landowner by
far in that whole region.

00:17:16.278 --> 00:17:21.517
So, in any one county those who
possessed the land constituted

00:17:21.517 --> 00:17:26.669
its natural governing class and
some of them had been in that

00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:29.160
position for generations.
 

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.092
But whatever pride they took in
their rank and their ancestry

00:17:33.092 --> 00:17:37.090
they knew very well that it was
based ultimately upon the land

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.670
that they possessed--
upon their landed wealth.

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.326
One gentleman,
Sir John Lowther,

00:17:43.326 --> 00:17:48.038
advised his sons as follows:
"Without...wealth (the

00:17:48.038 --> 00:17:53.520
supporter and upholder of gentry
and worldly reputation) nobility

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.318
and gentility is a vain and
contemptible title in England

00:17:58.318 --> 00:18:03.717
and always hath been...Preserve
your estate if you will preserve

00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:07.828
your gentility and nobility of
blood,

00:18:07.828 --> 00:18:12.318
which is nothing else but a
descent of riches."

00:18:12.318 --> 00:18:17.050
A frank recognition of the
realities of the social

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:18.210
structure.
 

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:18.532
Okay.
 

00:18:18.532 --> 00:18:22.348
So noblemen and gentlemen
possessed most landed property,

00:18:22.348 --> 00:18:24.634
but of course they were only a
tiny proportion of the

00:18:24.634 --> 00:18:28.670
population,
probably something like 2%.

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:32.920
The other 98% were the
'commonalty' and of these the

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.920
majority lived in the
countryside.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:38.853
England in the 1520s,
the earliest period for which

00:18:38.853 --> 00:18:41.670
we can make really good
population estimates,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:47.269
had about 2.4 million people
and not more than 10% of them

00:18:47.269 --> 00:18:48.940
lived in towns.
 

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.555
Indeed, only 5% of them lived
in towns that were bigger than

00:18:53.555 --> 00:18:55.118
5,000 inhabitants.
 

00:18:55.118 --> 00:18:58.020
5,000 inhabitants was
considered a good,

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.700
big town in the sixteenth
century.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:04.192
Wales had a population of only
about a quarter of a million and

00:19:04.192 --> 00:19:05.769
even fewer lived in towns.
 

00:19:05.769 --> 00:19:09.742
It's a mountainous region,
very few urban settlements

00:19:09.742 --> 00:19:11.730
except around the coast.
 

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.836
So we're dealing with an
overwhelmingly rural society,

00:19:15.836 --> 00:19:19.325
but the commonalty were far
from being just an

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.269
undifferentiated mass of
peasants.

00:19:22.269 --> 00:19:24.993
In rural society,
beneath the landowning

00:19:24.993 --> 00:19:29.394
gentlemen who drew their income
from rents, people were normally

00:19:29.394 --> 00:19:32.259
divided into four subordinate
groups.

00:19:32.259 --> 00:19:35.010
There were yeomen,
there were husbandmen,

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:38.382
there were craftsmen and
tradesmen, and there were

00:19:38.382 --> 00:19:40.240
cottagers and laborers.
 

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:44.057
You'll find definitions of
these different groups on your

00:19:44.057 --> 00:19:44.740
handout.
 

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.748
Yeomen are sometimes defined as
being owner-occupiers who

00:19:48.748 --> 00:19:52.400
possessed freehold land and they
sometimes were,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.220
but in fact most of them were
tenant farmers.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.971
The crucial thing about yeomen
is that they were substantial

00:19:58.971 --> 00:20:01.769
tenant farmers:
people who employed labor;

00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:06.417
people who could produce a
substantial marketable surplus

00:20:06.417 --> 00:20:09.490
which they could sell to the
towns.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:14.047
These were the people who were
sometimes described as the

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:18.196
better sort of people in their
villages or the chief

00:20:18.196 --> 00:20:19.500
inhabitants.
 

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.183
Beneath them were husbandmen,
small family farmers,

00:20:24.183 --> 00:20:28.868
generally with holdings of
under 30 acres or so;

00:20:28.868 --> 00:20:33.207
enough to support their
families and to produce a modest

00:20:33.207 --> 00:20:36.757
surplus to sell,
but relying for the most part

00:20:36.757 --> 00:20:39.358
on their direct family labor.
 

00:20:39.358 --> 00:20:42.368
Then there were village
craftsmen and tradesmen.

00:20:42.368 --> 00:20:45.710
Some of them might be people of
substance.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.714
Millers and blacksmiths were
able to make a good living,

00:20:48.714 --> 00:20:49.480
for example.
 

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.450
Others were usually poor.
 

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.498
Tailors or alehouse keepers who
brewed ale were generally

00:20:55.498 --> 00:20:56.798
relatively poor.
 

00:20:56.798 --> 00:21:01.977
Most craftsmen fell somewhere
between the two and most of them

00:21:01.977 --> 00:21:06.391
also farmed as well as
performing the duties of their

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.240
craft.
 

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.420
And finally there were the
cottagers and laborers.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:15.490
They sometimes held a few acres
of land which they rented from a

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.710
local landlord or from a local
farmer.

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:22.650
Some of them might have a trade
from time to time,

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:26.048
but most of them relied upon
wages for at least a significant

00:21:26.048 --> 00:21:30.383
part of their income,
working as farm laborers on the

00:21:30.383 --> 00:21:33.068
holdings of bigger tenants.
 

00:21:33.068 --> 00:21:36.190
Well, one can generalize in
that kind of way,

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:39.319
but the proportions of the
rural population that fell into

00:21:39.319 --> 00:21:42.779
these different groups varied
enormously from place to place.

00:21:42.779 --> 00:21:47.826
What you can say in general is
that rural society was highly

00:21:47.826 --> 00:21:49.279
differentiated.
 

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:52.220
A large minority of big yeomen
farmers,

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.946
a broad middle band of people
who could get a secure living as

00:21:55.946 --> 00:21:59.519
craftsmen or as husbandmen,
and another large minority,

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:03.259
probably about a quarter in the
early sixteenth century,

00:22:03.259 --> 00:22:08.227
who put together a rather bare
hand-to-mouth living as

00:22:08.227 --> 00:22:10.568
cottagers and laborers.
 

00:22:10.568 --> 00:22:14.999
But most people still had
access to the land one way or

00:22:14.999 --> 00:22:15.818
another.
 

00:22:15.818 --> 00:22:19.489
Even cottagers and laborers
generally had a small holding

00:22:19.489 --> 00:22:23.288
and they would have the right to
graze their animals on the

00:22:23.288 --> 00:22:27.430
commons of their village;
rights of pasture.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:31.092
Complete dependence upon wage
labor was still exceptional in

00:22:31.092 --> 00:22:34.817
the countryside and I emphasize
that because that's something

00:22:34.817 --> 00:22:38.046
that was going to change,
as we'll see,

00:22:38.046 --> 00:22:42.250
in the course of the sixteenth
century.

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:44.410
What about the towns then?
 

00:22:44.410 --> 00:22:48.387
The townspeople as I've said
were very much a minority but

00:22:48.387 --> 00:22:51.180
they were a very significant
minority.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:55.366
The towns ranged from tiny
market towns which came alive on

00:22:55.366 --> 00:22:59.338
market day to what were
considered the great cities with

00:22:59.338 --> 00:23:04.413
populations of above 5,000--
and the one truly significant

00:23:04.413 --> 00:23:07.253
city,
the city of London down here in

00:23:07.253 --> 00:23:11.532
the southeast with a population
in the early sixteenth century

00:23:11.532 --> 00:23:14.480
which had already reached about
55,000.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:20.124
So London was a significant
city by the standards of the

00:23:20.124 --> 00:23:20.740
day.
 

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.519
I'll look at the distribution
of towns in another lecture,

00:23:24.519 --> 00:23:29.484
but the thing to stress today
is that even small towns had a

00:23:29.484 --> 00:23:33.103
much more variegated
occupational and social

00:23:33.103 --> 00:23:36.470
structure than did country
villages.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.039
They contained merchants.
 

00:23:38.039 --> 00:23:39.710
They contained manufacturers.
 

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.770
They contained the small number
of highly prestigious

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:48.288
professional people;
lawyers, physicians.

00:23:48.288 --> 00:23:52.645
They contained more clergy than
country villages and they

00:23:52.645 --> 00:23:56.769
contained also large numbers of
unskilled laborers.

00:23:56.769 --> 00:23:59.496
So much for the range of
occupations, but within that

00:23:59.496 --> 00:24:02.432
range there were considerable
differentials of wealth and

00:24:02.432 --> 00:24:03.009
status.
 

00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:07.175
At the top the great merchants
of the cities could be men of

00:24:07.175 --> 00:24:10.990
prodigious wealth who were
generally also the rulers of

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:12.118
their towns.
 

00:24:12.118 --> 00:24:18.555
To give you just one example,
a man named Robert Jannys,

00:24:18.555 --> 00:24:21.130
spelled J-a-n-n-y-s.
 

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.904
He was a grocer and he was the
mayor of the city of Norwich,

00:24:24.904 --> 00:24:28.362
here in the East Anglian
region, in the early sixteenth

00:24:28.362 --> 00:24:29.130
century.
 

00:24:29.130 --> 00:24:34.134
In 1523, a tax was levied for
which the return survived and so

00:24:34.134 --> 00:24:38.809
we know that Robert Jannys'
personal tax return was bigger

00:24:38.809 --> 00:24:42.009
than the entire city of
Rochester,

00:24:42.009 --> 00:24:45.420
which was the biggest city down
here in Kent.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.830
He was a plutocrat and there
were men of such prodigious

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:53.200
wealth in all of England's major
cities.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:59.946
Beneath the urban elites were
the average master craftsmen of

00:24:59.946 --> 00:25:05.603
the towns,
those who provided clothing,

00:25:05.603 --> 00:25:08.888
leather goods,
metal wares,

00:25:08.888 --> 00:25:11.778
and so forth from their own
workshops.

00:25:11.778 --> 00:25:14.872
The principal distinction
amongst these people was between

00:25:14.872 --> 00:25:17.964
those who were independent
master craftsmen with their own

00:25:17.964 --> 00:25:20.950
workshop and those who were
known as 'journeymen',

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.868
people who worked for wages by
the day,

00:25:23.868 --> 00:25:28.407
skilled workers serving as
employees of the master

00:25:28.407 --> 00:25:29.519
craftsmen.
 

00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:32.984
Among the master craftsmen,
most of them worked entirely on

00:25:32.984 --> 00:25:36.817
their own account,
producing and retailing their

00:25:36.817 --> 00:25:39.257
goods,
but there were also those in

00:25:39.257 --> 00:25:42.220
some cities who had become
virtually employees of

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:46.046
large-scale merchant capitalists
who gave them raw materials to

00:25:46.046 --> 00:25:48.508
work on,
collected the finished

00:25:48.508 --> 00:25:50.980
products, and marketed the
goods.

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.798
This was known as the
'putting-out system'.

00:25:52.798 --> 00:25:56.818
You put out work to skilled
workers and you collect the

00:25:56.818 --> 00:26:00.320
goods and market them,
and I mention it specifically

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:03.490
because it was the form of
organization in England's most

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.559
important single industry,
the cloth industry,

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:10.886
the manufacture of woolen cloth
most of which was exported to

00:26:10.886 --> 00:26:15.068
Europe and which was very
prominent in certain regions.

00:26:15.068 --> 00:26:20.257
Norwich was a great cloth city,
so were many of the other towns

00:26:20.257 --> 00:26:22.934
of East Anglia,
southern England,

00:26:22.934 --> 00:26:25.779
and parts of the West Country.
 

00:26:25.779 --> 00:26:27.900
Okay.
 

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:32.066
We've looked then at some of
the major distinctions of wealth

00:26:32.066 --> 00:26:34.150
and status, rank and degree.
 

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:41.195
Let's turn to two other
categories that contemporaries

00:26:41.195 --> 00:26:45.848
tended to stress:
gender and age.

00:26:45.848 --> 00:26:49.939
For the most part,
so far in talking about wealth

00:26:49.939 --> 00:26:54.965
and status and rank I've been
talking about adult men and to

00:26:54.965 --> 00:26:59.395
do that is an accurate
reflection of the attitudes of

00:26:59.395 --> 00:27:03.144
the time,
the attitudes which they held

00:27:03.144 --> 00:27:07.088
towards the position of women
and of the young.

00:27:07.088 --> 00:27:12.090
Women and young people took
their place in the social order

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:17.608
from either their husbands or
their fathers or their masters,

00:27:17.608 --> 00:27:20.805
and to that extent it's been
said their social identities

00:27:20.805 --> 00:27:24.496
were 'subsumed',
absorbed, into the social

00:27:24.496 --> 00:27:30.544
identities of the adult male
heads of the households within

00:27:30.544 --> 00:27:32.630
which they lived.
 

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.605
When people talked about the
social order as a whole,

00:27:35.605 --> 00:27:38.180
women and children became
almost invisible;

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:43.267
they were just subsumed into
the identities of adult male

00:27:43.267 --> 00:27:44.630
householders.
 

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.307
Nevertheless,
contemporary moralists did have

00:27:47.307 --> 00:27:51.019
very clear views about the place
of women and children and the

00:27:51.019 --> 00:27:55.632
young in general,
and in both cases that place

00:27:55.632 --> 00:27:58.318
was a subordinate one.
 

00:27:58.318 --> 00:28:04.137
Now of course women (and some
of the young) were distinguished

00:28:04.137 --> 00:28:08.048
by social rank,
just as adult men were.

00:28:08.048 --> 00:28:13.453
Some women in particular might
hold positions of great status

00:28:13.453 --> 00:28:18.858
and power by virtue of their
birth and their inheritance,

00:28:18.858 --> 00:28:22.434
and we'll meet quite a few of
them in the course of the

00:28:22.434 --> 00:28:23.759
sixteenth century.
 

00:28:23.759 --> 00:28:26.346
But nonetheless,
although women were obviously

00:28:26.346 --> 00:28:30.218
distinguished by their rank,
they were also collectively

00:28:30.218 --> 00:28:34.999
distinguished by gender,
the social roles deemed proper

00:28:34.999 --> 00:28:38.817
for the different sexes,
and such distinctions were also

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:41.150
fundamental to the structure of
the social order,

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:45.368
as the Homily on Obedience
makes clear.

00:28:45.368 --> 00:28:50.246
In general, women's place was
seen as that of being dutiful

00:28:50.246 --> 00:28:54.365
adjunct to men as daughters,
as wives, as mothers,

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:55.880
or as sisters.
 

00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.601
They had little recognized role
outside the household and few

00:29:01.601 --> 00:29:07.037
opportunities to pursue an
independent career--at least in

00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:09.038
theory it was so.
 

00:29:09.038 --> 00:29:12.433
That subordination was
justified by the authority of

00:29:12.433 --> 00:29:15.163
scripture,
Saint Paul was constantly

00:29:15.163 --> 00:29:19.500
quoted on that point,
and it was also justified in

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:23.690
English law,
especially the law of property.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:28.884
According to English common
law, property was vested in male

00:29:28.884 --> 00:29:30.470
household heads.
 

00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:33.538
An unmarried woman who was
described in law--

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:36.160
using the Norman French that
they used in the law courts--

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:39.200
she was described in law as a
femme sole.

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.720
You'll find the term on your
handout.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.099
An unmarried woman could hold
property;

00:29:46.099 --> 00:29:50.807
she could make a contract;
she could engage independently

00:29:50.807 --> 00:29:52.630
in economic life.
 

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:56.897
But a married woman was subject
to the legal doctrine of

00:29:56.897 --> 00:29:57.828
coverture.
 

00:29:57.828 --> 00:30:02.854
She was described in the law as
a femme covert and her

00:30:02.854 --> 00:30:06.788
rights were seriously curtailed
by coverture.

00:30:06.788 --> 00:30:10.588
She could hold no goods
independently in marriage unless

00:30:10.588 --> 00:30:13.630
a separate trust had been
erected for her.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.058
There was no community of goods.
 

00:30:16.058 --> 00:30:19.750
Her husband got a life interest
in any lands which she brought

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:20.838
to the marriage.
 

00:30:20.838 --> 00:30:26.241
All of the movable goods of the
family were his and her rights

00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:28.900
were limited to her 'dower'.
 

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.339
That was usually a third of the
land and goods of the family

00:30:33.339 --> 00:30:37.704
which was reserved when her
husband died to keep her in her

00:30:37.704 --> 00:30:42.221
widowhood and would eventually
revert to the main heir of the

00:30:42.221 --> 00:30:43.200
family.
 

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.829
So that was the law as regards
women and in particular their

00:30:46.829 --> 00:30:50.163
property rights,
and all of this was bolstered

00:30:50.163 --> 00:30:54.118
by widespread assumptions about
the allegedly inferior

00:30:54.118 --> 00:30:58.758
capacities of women,
not only in terms of physical

00:30:58.758 --> 00:31:05.044
strength but also in terms of an
alleged weakness of intellectual

00:31:05.044 --> 00:31:08.578
capacity and emotional
stability.

00:31:08.578 --> 00:31:11.825
(The piece on the longer
reading list by Crawford and

00:31:11.825 --> 00:31:15.258
Mendelson on Women in Early
Modern England has an

00:31:15.258 --> 00:31:18.752
excellent lucid discussion of
these issues in its opening

00:31:18.752 --> 00:31:21.107
chapter,
especially the medical

00:31:21.107 --> 00:31:23.558
attitudes towards women at the
time).

00:31:23.558 --> 00:31:26.074
So, as a result,
any failings which were

00:31:26.074 --> 00:31:29.621
observable in women were
attributed not to their unequal

00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:32.586
opportunities or their
restricted education but

00:31:32.586 --> 00:31:35.358
supposedly their natural
weaknesses,

00:31:35.358 --> 00:31:40.924
and the fact that many men also
shared these weaknesses was

00:31:40.924 --> 00:31:43.420
conveniently overlooked.
 

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.566
Well, the official view of the
church on all of this was again

00:31:48.566 --> 00:31:53.123
read out every year in another
homily, the Homily on

00:31:53.123 --> 00:31:54.220
Marriage.
 

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:58.578
The Homily on Marriage
declared that--I'm quoting--

00:31:58.578 --> 00:32:04.301
"The woman is a weak
creature not endowed with the

00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:08.328
like strength and constancy of
mind.

00:32:08.328 --> 00:32:12.931
Therefore, they be the sooner
disquieted and they be the more

00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:17.301
prone to weak affections and
dispositions of the mind more

00:32:17.301 --> 00:32:18.990
than men be."
 

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:23.190
And the homilist went on that
therefore "a woman must be

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:28.007
spared and borne with,
the rather in that she is the

00:32:28.007 --> 00:32:30.440
weaker vessel"
--

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.541
a phrase from the Homily on
Marriage which was often

00:32:34.541 --> 00:32:35.318
repeated.
 

00:32:35.318 --> 00:32:38.865
The same homily went on to
advise that "men and women

00:32:38.865 --> 00:32:41.541
should live in a perpetual
friendship,"

00:32:41.541 --> 00:32:46.250
but it was one based,
of course, upon the assumption

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:50.368
of female acceptance of male
authority.

00:32:50.368 --> 00:32:53.259
One of the greater preachers of
the late sixteenth century,

00:32:53.259 --> 00:32:57.209
William Perkins,
a great puritan preacher who

00:32:57.209 --> 00:33:00.528
preached in the city of
Cambridge,

00:33:00.528 --> 00:33:04.548
said as follows concerning
husbands and wives:

00:33:04.548 --> 00:33:09.891
"The goodman or master of
the family is a person in whom

00:33:09.891 --> 00:33:14.609
resteth the private and proper
government of the whole

00:33:14.609 --> 00:33:19.240
household: and he comes to it
not by election...

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:25.122
but by the ordinance of God,
settled even in the course of

00:33:25.122 --> 00:33:26.670
nature."
 

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:30.509
And he continued--"The
goodwife of the house is a

00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:34.928
person which yieldeth help and
assistance in government to the

00:33:34.928 --> 00:33:36.740
master of the family.
 

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:42.839
For he is, as it were,
the prince and chief ruler;

00:33:42.839 --> 00:33:48.588
she is the associate."
 

00:33:48.588 --> 00:33:52.144
Well, how far these
prescriptions were actually

00:33:52.144 --> 00:33:56.318
observed in practice we'll see
in the next lecture,

00:33:56.318 --> 00:33:59.970
and also if you wish to work on
it there's an abundant

00:33:59.970 --> 00:34:01.828
literature on that issue.
 

00:34:01.828 --> 00:34:06.118
But these were the prescriptive
values of the time.

00:34:06.118 --> 00:34:09.077
Now of course women,
whatever their formal

00:34:09.077 --> 00:34:12.900
subordination to their husbands
and their fathers,

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:16.934
did of course bear some
authority in the commonwealth

00:34:16.934 --> 00:34:19.030
alongside their husbands.
 

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:24.402
They bore authority over their
children and over the servants

00:34:24.402 --> 00:34:28.161
and apprentices,
the young people who lived

00:34:28.161 --> 00:34:30.670
within their households.
 

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:34.639
Servants were generally young,
generally aged between about

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.829
fourteen and the mid-twenties.
 

00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:40.275
They were generally hired on
annual contracts and they lived

00:34:40.275 --> 00:34:43.369
in the households of their
masters and mistresses,

00:34:43.369 --> 00:34:48.282
and in return for their labor
they were fed and clothed and

00:34:48.282 --> 00:34:53.364
given lodging and a small wage
which was very often paid only

00:34:53.364 --> 00:34:54.719
once a year.
 

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:58.137
Some servants stayed with
particular households for years

00:34:58.137 --> 00:35:01.492
and might form quite a close
bond with their masters and

00:35:01.492 --> 00:35:04.315
mistresses,
but most moved on at the end of

00:35:04.315 --> 00:35:04.969
each year.
 

00:35:04.969 --> 00:35:08.188
They would go to the hiring
fair and be hired into a new

00:35:08.188 --> 00:35:11.179
household,
moving around an area from

00:35:11.179 --> 00:35:16.411
village to village until they
would eventually settle down and

00:35:16.411 --> 00:35:19.929
marry in their mid- to late-
twenties.

00:35:19.929 --> 00:35:22.831
In the towns,
the duties of servants were

00:35:22.831 --> 00:35:26.530
largely domestic and servants
were mostly women,

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:30.853
leading some towns to have an
unbalanced sex ratio in favor of

00:35:30.853 --> 00:35:31.420
women.
 

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.572
In the countryside,
both male and female servants

00:35:34.572 --> 00:35:37.858
worked on the farm,
engaged in domestic tasks or in

00:35:37.858 --> 00:35:39.369
agricultural tasks.
 

00:35:39.369 --> 00:35:43.755
They were known as 'servants in
husbandry' because they engaged

00:35:43.755 --> 00:35:46.159
in husbandry--agricultural work.
 

00:35:46.159 --> 00:35:51.503
But whatever the case servants
were a very large and a very

00:35:51.503 --> 00:35:56.429
distinctive part of society,
a distinctive part of the labor

00:35:56.429 --> 00:35:59.768
force in particular in
sixteenth-century England.

00:35:59.768 --> 00:36:04.472
It's been estimated that
perhaps a quarter of the entire

00:36:04.472 --> 00:36:09.690
population lived in other
people's households as servants,

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:13.983
and it's been estimated that
60% of the population aged

00:36:13.983 --> 00:36:18.835
between fifteen and twenty-four
were living as servants at any

00:36:18.835 --> 00:36:22.427
one time--
so it was a distinctive element

00:36:22.427 --> 00:36:26.581
of the population and a
distinctive phase of the life

00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:29.059
cycle for most young people.
 

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:33.251
While they were living through
that stage they lived under the

00:36:33.251 --> 00:36:37.101
authority of a master and a
mistress in a household which

00:36:37.101 --> 00:36:41.570
perhaps did a great deal to
shape their social expectations,

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:46.480
particularly their expectations
regarding authority;

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.690
part of their socialization.
 

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:55.922
Apprentices were predominantly
urban and they were usually

00:36:55.922 --> 00:37:01.523
male, young men in their late
teens and early twenties for the

00:37:01.523 --> 00:37:02.809
most part.
 

00:37:02.809 --> 00:37:06.521
One tends to think of
apprentices as little boys sent

00:37:06.521 --> 00:37:10.090
out to learn a craft at the age
of seven or ten.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:12.570
In fact, they were more like
modern students.

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:16.559
They were generally in their
late teens and early twenties,

00:37:16.559 --> 00:37:18.940
and they had been bound by an
indenture,

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:23.105
a legal indenture,
to a master to learn a trade

00:37:23.105 --> 00:37:25.369
over a period of years.
 

00:37:25.369 --> 00:37:27.949
Usually, apprentices were
migrants to the towns.

00:37:27.949 --> 00:37:31.338
They'd come in to learn a
trade, were bound,

00:37:31.338 --> 00:37:35.043
lived in with their masters,
and, like servants,

00:37:35.043 --> 00:37:37.250
they were very numerous.
 

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:42.472
It's been estimated that in
1550 about 10% of the population

00:37:42.472 --> 00:37:45.039
of London were apprentices.
 

00:37:45.039 --> 00:37:48.237
They differed from servants in
that they tended to stay with

00:37:48.237 --> 00:37:51.219
their master for the whole
period of their training,

00:37:51.219 --> 00:37:55.380
which was usually a period of
seven years.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.045
They enjoyed a superior status
because they had superior

00:37:59.045 --> 00:38:00.380
prospects in life.
 

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:04.996
One day they would be skilled
journeymen and then perhaps

00:38:04.996 --> 00:38:09.449
master craftsmen themselves and
they were aware of this

00:38:09.449 --> 00:38:10.768
distinction.
 

00:38:10.768 --> 00:38:16.695
But in the meantime they too
lived very much under the

00:38:16.695 --> 00:38:19.940
authority of their masters.
 

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:24.967
So most of the young then lived
in positions of subordination

00:38:24.967 --> 00:38:30.081
and they had social identities
which were merged with those of

00:38:30.081 --> 00:38:35.110
the adult householders under
whose authority they lived.

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.369
To give you one example of this
I recently encountered,

00:38:39.369 --> 00:38:43.842
I was looking at the deaths
recorded in parish registers in

00:38:43.842 --> 00:38:48.161
a plague year in the early
seventeenth century and it was

00:38:48.161 --> 00:38:53.329
striking that servants were not
recorded under their own names.

00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:56.918
When servants had died of the
plague and were buried they were

00:38:56.918 --> 00:39:00.153
put down in the parish register
as "Robert Foster's

00:39:00.153 --> 00:39:02.920
maid" or "a man of
John Atkinson"

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.036
or terms like this,
the actual name of the servant

00:39:06.036 --> 00:39:06.829
not mentioned.
 

00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:10.023
They're just anonymous;
they're attributed to their

00:39:10.023 --> 00:39:13.070
master or their mistress when
they were buried.

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:19.695
It's just a striking example of
that kind of social submergence

00:39:19.695 --> 00:39:24.289
within the identities of their
superiors.

00:39:24.289 --> 00:39:28.271
And outside the household too
the prevailing ideal of the age

00:39:28.271 --> 00:39:30.860
was what's been called
gerontocratic.

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.039
That is to say,
the old should rule;

00:39:34.039 --> 00:39:38.130
the young should serve and show
respect.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:42.681
The moralists of the time when
they wrote about youth

00:39:42.681 --> 00:39:48.018
conventionally saw it as a time
of hope but also of danger.

00:39:48.018 --> 00:39:51.891
The young were conventionally
portrayed as being unusually

00:39:51.891 --> 00:39:55.311
subject to fits of passion,
to rashness,

00:39:55.311 --> 00:39:59.110
to volatility,
to intemperance,

00:39:59.110 --> 00:40:01.889
and to sexual lasciviousness.
 

00:40:01.889 --> 00:40:05.010
Where they got this idea from
one can't imagine.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.719
&gt;
 

00:40:06.719 --> 00:40:12.052
Wisdom and self-control were
regarded as coming only with

00:40:12.052 --> 00:40:14.454
age,
and accordingly there was a

00:40:14.454 --> 00:40:18.309
preference for age and seniority
in all institutional life.

00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:20.829
Well, one could say,
"well,

00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:24.059
that's just the same
today," but one important

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:27.291
difference is that in the
sixteenth and seventeenth

00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:30.521
centuries a far larger
proportion of the population

00:40:30.521 --> 00:40:31.619
were young.
 

00:40:31.619 --> 00:40:35.543
The high birth rates of the
time and the low life expectancy

00:40:35.543 --> 00:40:39.333
meant that the population was
far younger than is the case

00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:40.000
today.
 

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.494
Far fewer people lived through
to their fifties and even fewer

00:40:45.494 --> 00:40:50.177
to their sixties when they
enjoyed these positions of

00:40:50.177 --> 00:40:51.440
authority.
 

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:56.289
So then the young lived also in
a situation of subordination.

00:40:56.289 --> 00:41:00.534
True adulthood came only when
they eventually married and

00:41:00.534 --> 00:41:05.161
achieved economic independence
and had households or workshops

00:41:05.161 --> 00:41:06.449
or their own.
 

00:41:06.449 --> 00:41:10.760
Then young men were transformed
into masters of families,

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.650
young women were transformed
into mistresses of families,

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.367
and their place in the social
order shifted upwards

00:41:18.367 --> 00:41:19.409
accordingly.
 

00:41:19.409 --> 00:41:23.148
From that point on,
differences in their rank were

00:41:23.148 --> 00:41:27.880
paramount for men in the public
domain of society at large,

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.449
though within the household
differences of gender of course

00:41:32.449 --> 00:41:34.420
still held their place.
 

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.835
So to sum up,
this was a very highly

00:41:38.835 --> 00:41:43.380
structured and stratified
society.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:47.780
It was inegalitarian in its
social ideals.

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.239
It was conceived of as a
commonwealth,

00:41:51.239 --> 00:41:55.123
as an organic whole,
but one constituted of people

00:41:55.123 --> 00:41:59.324
whose opportunities and
experiences were very far from

00:41:59.324 --> 00:42:03.244
uniform or equal,
and that structured inequality

00:42:03.244 --> 00:42:07.159
was taken to be part of the
natural order of society.

00:42:07.159 --> 00:42:11.693
Indeed, it was taken to be
ordained by God,

00:42:11.693 --> 00:42:13.420
as we've seen.
 

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:17.300
It was a predominantly rural
society in which most people

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:21.041
gained their livings from the
land but in which a large

00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:25.199
minority were also engaged in
manufactures and in trade.

00:42:25.199 --> 00:42:28.248
It was a world in which most
people still aspired to gain

00:42:28.248 --> 00:42:30.480
their living relatively
independently,

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:33.429
on the land or by practicing a
trade,

00:42:33.429 --> 00:42:37.780
but in which a large minority
already depended on selling

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:40.500
their labor and skills to
others.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.934
Throughout the whole structure,
the household was the principal

00:42:45.934 --> 00:42:51.195
place not only of residence but
of economic production and it

00:42:51.195 --> 00:42:56.454
was the most immediate unit of
authority under its master and

00:42:56.454 --> 00:42:57.768
mistress.
 

00:42:57.768 --> 00:43:02.268
It's been said that to a very
large extent social organization

00:43:02.268 --> 00:43:06.253
in this period was domestic
organization focused on the

00:43:06.253 --> 00:43:09.815
household,
be it the humble household or

00:43:09.815 --> 00:43:14.389
the great household of the
aristocracy or indeed of the

00:43:14.389 --> 00:43:16.000
monarch himself.
 

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.532
So next time I'll take a closer
look at how those thousands of

00:43:20.532 --> 00:43:23.949
households functioned:
on the roles of men,

00:43:23.949 --> 00:43:28.380
women and children within them,
on their priorities and

00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:30.976
strategies,
their basic values,

00:43:30.976 --> 00:43:35.159
how they were formed,
and how, so far as we can tell,

00:43:35.159 --> 00:43:36.099
they lived.
 

00:43:36.099 --> 00:43:41.000

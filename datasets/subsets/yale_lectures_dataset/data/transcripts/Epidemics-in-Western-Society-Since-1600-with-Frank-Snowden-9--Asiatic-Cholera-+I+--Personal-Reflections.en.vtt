00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.050
We can get started.
 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.222
And this morning will be a
slightly different style of

00:00:07.222 --> 00:00:08.010
lecture.
 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.909
You'll notice that you don't
have handouts,

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.050
and that wasn't an oversight.
 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.430
It was actually because you
won't need them this morning.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.330
What we're going to be doing is
something of an experiment,

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.460
which is that it seemed to me
that it was useful,

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.000
when you were reading various
historical works,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.416
that sometimes the author of
one of them should explain and

00:00:34.416 --> 00:00:38.300
discuss with you how they came
to be as they are.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.734
So, that was one of the reasons
that I put my own book,

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:44.470
this one, on Naples,
on the reading list.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.394
And I thought this morning I'd
try the experiment of a

00:00:48.394 --> 00:00:52.466
different kind of lecture,
where I talk to you about how

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.280
it came to be the work that it
is.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.765
We're moving on now from the
material on the Paris School and

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:09.230
on plague and smallpox,
to our next major epidemic

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.936
disease,
which was the great feared

00:01:11.936 --> 00:01:13.968
disease of the nineteenth
century,

00:01:13.968 --> 00:01:17.438
which was Asiatic cholera,
which hit Europe--

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:21.965
it wasn't an endemic
disease--it hit Europe for the

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:26.872
first time around 1830,
and returned in a series of

00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:29.519
pandemics in various waves.
 

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:36.084
And normally the official
historiography has it that about

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:42.420
the last epidemic in Western
Europe was in the 1890s.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.861
And the statistics of the WHO
in the various countries of

00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:50.965
Europe support--
and the literature as

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:55.269
well--support this conclusion,
that Asiatic cholera,

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:59.940
after the 1890s,
returns again to Western Europe

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.450
only in tiny little outbreaks,
the last of which was 1973.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.538
So, there really isn't
supposedly a history of cholera

00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:15.090
in the twentieth century in
Europe.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.127
And it's that that I want to
challenge and to talk with you

00:02:19.127 --> 00:02:20.590
about this morning.
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.527
Now, as I began--and here we
can start into how the book came

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:28.310
to exist at all.
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.620
I, at the time--well,
one, there's this sort of,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.080
as I started doing research on
a very different topic,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.841
I had, in a sense perhaps,
been primed for an interest in

00:02:41.841 --> 00:02:42.870
cholera.
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.129
I had been primed because I had
lived through an outbreak in

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.949
Rome in 1973,
and I had noticed a number of

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.500
things that had captured my
attention--

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.545
because this was Italy,
this world seventh industrial

00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:04.347
power at the time--
and I remember some strange

00:03:04.347 --> 00:03:05.229
phenomena.
 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:10.644
Being in Rome--the epidemic had
started and found its epicenter

00:03:10.644 --> 00:03:12.740
in the city of Naples.
 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.631
And cars had,
at that time,

00:03:15.631 --> 00:03:21.524
license plates that bore the
province of origin of the

00:03:21.524 --> 00:03:25.068
vehicle,
and cars in Rome that had

00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:30.530
Naples license plates were being
stoned by the citizens of Rome.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.840
It was also true that in the
fish and vegetable markets near

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.080
the apartment where I was
living,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:44.882
that the stalls of the fish and
vegetable sellers were attacked

00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:47.410
and overturned by crowds.
 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.107
So, this seemed something that
captured my imagination very

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:54.090
clearly.
 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.301
And then the minister of health
went on television and said that

00:03:59.301 --> 00:04:04.514
you really didn't need to worry
because all you had to do was to

00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:07.330
squeeze--
because the Vibrio,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.280
the bacterium that causes
Asiatic cholera,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.426
is highly susceptible to acid;
so all you have to do is

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:17.940
squeeze a little lemon juice on
your raw mussels,

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.089
and then you can quite happily
eat them;

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:24.990
which I wouldn't advise any of
you.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.163
In any case,
it was also true that this

00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:33.423
prime minister and the minister
of health visited Naples and the

00:04:33.423 --> 00:04:36.680
infectious diseases hospital
there.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.632
And there's an Italian magazine
in which pictures of them

00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:44.406
appeared,
and you could see them almost

00:04:44.406 --> 00:04:48.574
running down the wards,
as they were visiting the

00:04:48.574 --> 00:04:51.699
patients,
and behind them they had their

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.803
hands--
you can imagine them

00:04:53.803 --> 00:04:58.694
trotting--with this gesture,
which is a gesture to ward off

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:01.660
the evil eye in Italian culture.
 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.966
So, this seemed rather strange
in the world's seventh

00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:07.540
industrial power.
 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.571
In a sense I had,
then, this subliminal message

00:05:11.571 --> 00:05:14.990
that came from an earlier
experience.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.360
But there I was,
a decade or so later,

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.997
and my project was--I thought
that I was interested in

00:05:22.997 --> 00:05:26.759
political philosophy and social
history,

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.814
and I was working on the
disappearance of the European

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:37.060
peasantry under the press of
economic circumstances,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.750
and major transformations in
the countryside,

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.322
and the coming of the
commercial revolution in

00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:46.608
agriculture,
urbanization and the Industrial

00:05:46.608 --> 00:05:47.550
Revolution.
 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:53.122
But I began to have my
imagination captured by numbers

00:05:53.122 --> 00:05:59.432
of references that I began to
find around the early twentieth

00:05:59.432 --> 00:06:04.060
century to cholera in Italy
around 1910.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.125
And that seemed a little
surprising to me,

00:06:07.125 --> 00:06:11.088
and it really began--I began to
read more about it.

00:06:11.088 --> 00:06:15.838
And it seemed to illustrate how
people's lives were lived,

00:06:15.838 --> 00:06:20.589
and their standard of living,
much better than the project

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:23.339
that I originally began with.
 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:28.430
And, so, I let this medical
project have a life of its own,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.379
and this is what eventually
became my book.

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:37.579
As I was working more on
cholera, however,

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:41.600
something else came to the
forefront of my attention,

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.113
and that was a conflict between
what I read about cholera in the

00:06:46.113 --> 00:06:49.838
literature and what I was
beginning to find in my own

00:06:49.838 --> 00:06:50.769
research.
 

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:55.732
The literature said that there
wasn't a major epidemic in the

00:06:55.732 --> 00:07:00.612
twentieth century in Europe,
the last major one being in the

00:07:00.612 --> 00:07:01.439
1890s.
 

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:06.055
But I was beginning to find odd
references to some very strange

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:09.803
events,
particularly in the summer of

00:07:09.803 --> 00:07:13.004
1911,
and I began to think that

00:07:13.004 --> 00:07:18.747
perhaps a very interesting
policy of concealment was taking

00:07:18.747 --> 00:07:22.112
place;
that is, an epidemic that was

00:07:22.112 --> 00:07:24.670
concealed by the authorities.
 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:28.910
And Naples once again was a
very interesting place.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:34.286
Now, Naples is,
if you're interested in cholera

00:07:34.286 --> 00:07:38.802
in the West,
Naples is a very interesting

00:07:38.802 --> 00:07:43.940
place because it was the city--
it was the largest city in

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.610
Europe in the nineteenth
century,

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.190
and it was scourged the most
often by this affliction.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:56.084
And I'm going to be arguing
that it was scourged also in

00:07:56.084 --> 00:08:01.336
times that aren't recorded in
the standard historiography of

00:08:01.336 --> 00:08:05.459
the subject,
and in particular in 1911.

00:08:05.459 --> 00:08:11.254
It also is an extraordinary
place because it has something

00:08:11.254 --> 00:08:15.319
happen that you won't find
elsewhere,

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:18.139
and that is this is a city that
was actually,

00:08:18.139 --> 00:08:21.649
after the dreadful epidemic of
1884,

00:08:21.649 --> 00:08:26.790
was rebuilt in order to make
the city cholera-proof,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:28.528
so that it wouldn't return.
 

00:08:28.528 --> 00:08:33.077
So, we see an extraordinary--we
talk about the impact of

00:08:33.077 --> 00:08:38.365
infectious diseases,
and here we see a case study of

00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:45.029
a place where the city itself is
reconstructed specifically as

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:49.178
result of an epidemic
catastrophe,

00:08:49.178 --> 00:08:51.820
in order not to make another
one possible.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.058
We can directly see in bricks
and mortar,

00:08:55.058 --> 00:08:58.570
and in the sewers underground
and the buildings above,

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:02.938
and in the layout of the city,
you can see the impact of

00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:05.798
cholera and of the idea of
miasma.

00:09:05.798 --> 00:09:09.601
Because the miasmatic
interpretation was the one under

00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.259
which had guided the
reconstruction of the city,

00:09:13.259 --> 00:09:18.399
which happened in the wake of
the 1884 catastrophe.

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:23.788
But in 1911,
there was no public record of a

00:09:23.788 --> 00:09:25.918
major epidemic.
 

00:09:25.918 --> 00:09:32.759
I had a whiff of the fact that
there was, but I couldn't prove

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:33.320
it.
 

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.417
So, how do you go about
demonstrating an epidemic that

00:09:38.417 --> 00:09:41.110
doesn't have a literature?
 

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:45.620
I thought that the first thing
that would be useful to do would

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.184
be to visit Naples,
and in particular to visit the

00:09:49.184 --> 00:09:50.639
Naples Cemetery.
 

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:54.966
The cemetery is a very large
one--you can visit it

00:09:54.966 --> 00:09:59.908
yourselves--and it's a very
monumental grand cemetery.

00:09:59.908 --> 00:10:05.509
And I went in the middle of the
week with the idea that I would

00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:11.288
go to the registry and perhaps
there find records of burials,

00:10:11.288 --> 00:10:17.193
and that I would also be able
to see in stone the victims of a

00:10:17.193 --> 00:10:18.840
major epidemic.
 

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:22.606
In other words,
the first idea I had was that

00:10:22.606 --> 00:10:25.893
you can't--
in order to prove that there

00:10:25.893 --> 00:10:29.582
was an epidemic,
you would have to have a sudden

00:10:29.582 --> 00:10:33.210
bulge in mortality in the summer
months of 1911.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.381
And I thought I could
demonstrate that by visiting the

00:10:36.381 --> 00:10:40.105
Naples Cemetery,
and if there wasn't a sudden

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:44.779
excess of death in the summer,
then I would know that I was

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:48.404
actually on the wrong trail
entirely and I should abandon my

00:10:48.404 --> 00:10:49.080
project.
 

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:53.070
Well, as I was walking through
the monumental cemetery--

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.730
I think it was a Wednesday or a
Thursday--

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:00.360
I suddenly had a car pull up
alongside me,

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.250
and the man inside said,
"Get in,

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.178
get in."
 

00:11:06.178 --> 00:11:09.389
I don't know exactly how you
would have reacted.

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:13.378
I hesitated;
particularly as it was a

00:11:13.378 --> 00:11:18.839
cemetery in which on a Wednesday
and a Thursday I found myself

00:11:18.839 --> 00:11:23.063
completely alone,
except for this strange request

00:11:23.063 --> 00:11:27.450
that I get in a car with someone
I had never seen before.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.914
Well, it turns out,
as we talked,

00:11:29.914 --> 00:11:34.461
that he was the director of the
cemetery, and he had come to

00:11:34.461 --> 00:11:35.538
rescue me.
 

00:11:35.538 --> 00:11:39.517
And, so, I did eventually get
in, and he took me out of the

00:11:39.517 --> 00:11:42.731
cemetery,
scolding me and telling me that

00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:47.268
I was obviously a stranger,
an outsider and a foreigner who

00:11:47.268 --> 00:11:49.631
knew nothing,
and that, in fact,

00:11:49.631 --> 00:11:53.804
the Naples cemetery is the most
dangerous place you can be in

00:11:53.804 --> 00:11:56.856
the city,
which has a long history of

00:11:56.856 --> 00:12:00.235
organized crime,
because during the week this

00:12:00.235 --> 00:12:03.710
was, in fact,
where the local mafia did its

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:06.998
drug deals,
and that everyone in Naples

00:12:06.998 --> 00:12:11.359
knew this except me,
and he was possibly saving my

00:12:11.359 --> 00:12:13.220
life by removing me.
 

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.519
It wasn't that I wasn't welcome.
 

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:19.269
I was welcome to come back on
Saturday and Sunday,

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:24.293
because that's when all the
people of Naples do come to pay

00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:27.500
their respects to their
relatives,

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.418
and there are flower stalls and
gazillions of people frequenting

00:12:32.418 --> 00:12:36.351
the cemetery then,
and the registry office with

00:12:36.351 --> 00:12:38.970
the records was also open then.
 

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.950
I also discovered that there
was, in fact--

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:47.102
by reading the newspapers
surrounding the time of my

00:12:47.102 --> 00:12:49.897
visit,
that that very summer there was

00:12:49.897 --> 00:12:52.091
the--
I was doing a little checking

00:12:52.091 --> 00:12:55.613
up, and it turns out that the
rector of the cemetery wasn't

00:12:55.613 --> 00:12:58.830
kidding me at all--
that there was a major drug

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:00.778
bust in this very cemetery.
 

00:13:00.778 --> 00:13:04.636
And the way they had done it
was that they had wired the

00:13:04.636 --> 00:13:09.224
tombstones,
and in this way they had pulled

00:13:09.224 --> 00:13:13.759
off a major move against the
Camorra,

00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:18.187
which is the local,
if we like, subset of the

00:13:18.187 --> 00:13:21.908
organized crime families in
Italy,

00:13:21.908 --> 00:13:25.960
and one of the most important
crime syndicates in the world,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.480
in modern times.
 

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.519
So, that was--that brought me
back on a weekend.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:35.840
And on the weekend I discovered
that there was,

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.985
in fact, a big mortality bulge;
that there were lots of people

00:13:41.985 --> 00:13:46.250
who'd been buried in the summer
of 1911,

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:51.570
well in excess of the year
before, 1910,

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:55.559
1909, or the years that were
succeeded,

00:13:55.559 --> 00:13:58.210
1912 or 1913.
 

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:03.522
And there was a book that
registered the deaths and

00:14:03.522 --> 00:14:08.408
burials, and there was a huge
bulge in 1911.

00:14:08.408 --> 00:14:10.580
So, I knew something had
happened.

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:17.029
And something was interesting,
because one of the features of

00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:23.803
the book that's the register of
burials is that they provide the

00:14:23.803 --> 00:14:29.610
neighborhood from which the
deceased was resident.

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:34.823
But in this case they,
instead of the usual record of

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:39.365
a neighborhood,
they had the marking Cotugno

00:14:39.365 --> 00:14:42.523
Hospital,
was the last place that the

00:14:42.523 --> 00:14:43.990
deceased had been.
 

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.697
And the Cotugno Hospital,
then as now,

00:14:46.697 --> 00:14:50.428
was the infectious diseases
hospital of the city.

00:14:50.428 --> 00:14:56.620
I suddenly knew that there was
this great excess of mortality

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:01.995
in the summer of 1911,
and that the mortality was from

00:15:01.995 --> 00:15:06.134
infectious diseases,
because the people had been

00:15:06.134 --> 00:15:11.003
buried in vast numbers from the
Cotugno Hospital as their last

00:15:11.003 --> 00:15:12.278
port of call.
 

00:15:12.278 --> 00:15:17.254
Then the next thought--and I
think a lot of historical work

00:15:17.254 --> 00:15:21.971
is a bit like detective
work--and I found myself playing

00:15:21.971 --> 00:15:24.460
a sort of detective role.
 

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:29.908
So, my next place to visit was
the Cotugno Hospital of

00:15:29.908 --> 00:15:32.168
Infectious Diseases.
 

00:15:32.168 --> 00:15:39.409
And I made two findings there
that were confirming me in my

00:15:39.409 --> 00:15:44.029
vision of what might have
happened;

00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:48.885
that they were--there was in
the library of the hospital,

00:15:48.885 --> 00:15:53.134
the hospital itself had
preserved its own records,

00:15:53.134 --> 00:15:54.870
patient records.
 

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.119
And after some persistence,
I was allowed to look at

00:15:58.119 --> 00:16:02.312
patient records in the hospital,
and found something interesting

00:16:02.312 --> 00:16:06.260
and mysterious,
and that was that there were

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:10.980
records of the patient records
through 1908,

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:16.230
'09, '10, and the first half of
1911,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.009
and then suddenly there were no
records at all.

00:16:20.009 --> 00:16:24.514
There was a mysterious
disappearance of the records of

00:16:24.514 --> 00:16:27.149
the patients of the hospital.
 

00:16:27.149 --> 00:16:31.407
Then I went to the library of
the Infectious Diseases

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:33.802
Hospital,
where there was a second

00:16:33.802 --> 00:16:37.577
interesting thing,
which was that the hospital had

00:16:37.577 --> 00:16:41.350
its own research journal that it
published,

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:47.100
recording the research findings
of its own physicians,

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.750
its own house physicians and
interns and residents.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:55.769
The result of that was to
discover that for surprise,

00:16:55.769 --> 00:17:00.644
surprise, in the summer of 1911
the physicians of the Cotugno

00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:05.519
Hospital were doing lots and
lots of research on therapeutics

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:07.470
for Asiatic cholera.
 

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:10.604
They were experimenting with
giving patients ice,

00:17:10.604 --> 00:17:14.586
and lots of other therapeutic
procedures that we'll talk about

00:17:14.586 --> 00:17:16.348
in a couple of minutes.
 

00:17:16.348 --> 00:17:20.836
So, I now knew that the
physicians of the Infectious

00:17:20.836 --> 00:17:25.150
Diseases Hospital were
enormously preoccupied with

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.910
Asiatic cholera.
 

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.939
Then the next place was to go
to the local archives,

00:17:31.939 --> 00:17:36.278
where I was told that my idea
was impossible,

00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:41.695
there was no such thing;
that there also--the local

00:17:41.695 --> 00:17:47.825
records had been moved during
the Second World War out of the

00:17:47.825 --> 00:17:53.391
city for safekeeping,
to the Sanctuary of Monte

00:17:53.391 --> 00:17:58.088
Cassino, an abbey outside of the
city.

00:17:58.088 --> 00:18:01.210
But I think a number of you
have heard of Monte Cassino.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.348
It became a major battle site
in the war,

00:18:04.348 --> 00:18:09.240
and so the abbey itself and all
of the archives went up in

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.224
flames,
and so all the records of the

00:18:12.224 --> 00:18:16.328
city for the period I was
interested in were destroyed.

00:18:16.328 --> 00:18:20.846
And I was told that a project
of the kind that I was imagining

00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:24.769
was inconceivable and also
couldn't be carried out.

00:18:24.769 --> 00:18:30.602
So, what do you do next if you
think there's a major epidemic

00:18:30.602 --> 00:18:34.880
and you want to demonstrate its
existence?

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:40.605
The next thing that happened
was that I had the idea that

00:18:40.605 --> 00:18:45.883
this was a time,
in 1911, that was the height of

00:18:45.883 --> 00:18:51.448
mass emigration of Italians--
that is, I've said that I had

00:18:51.448 --> 00:18:56.286
been studying the disappearance
of the European peasantry and

00:18:56.286 --> 00:19:00.640
its transformation into workers
or urban dwellers,

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:05.680
and a part of that was the
extraordinary story of Italian

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.836
transoceanic migration,
in large part to this country,

00:19:09.836 --> 00:19:12.259
but also to Australia and other
places.

00:19:12.259 --> 00:19:18.329
So, I thought if there really
was a mass movement--and Naples

00:19:18.329 --> 00:19:20.858
is and was then a port.
 

00:19:20.858 --> 00:19:27.085
It was one of Europe's,
along with Hamburg,

00:19:27.085 --> 00:19:30.048
major port cities.
 

00:19:30.048 --> 00:19:34.178
And what Naples specialized
in--if Hamburg specialized in

00:19:34.178 --> 00:19:37.895
goods and services,
Naples specialized in the

00:19:37.895 --> 00:19:42.584
export of people,
and in particular Italian

00:19:42.584 --> 00:19:46.048
emigrants to New York City.
 

00:19:46.048 --> 00:19:49.240
There was enormous transoceanic
migration.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.809
I thought well,
if this is true,

00:19:52.809 --> 00:19:56.973
and these thousands,
hundreds-of-thousands of

00:19:56.973 --> 00:20:00.130
emigrants are moving through the
city of Naples,

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:02.640
and there is a major cholera
epidemic,

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.778
and they're arriving at Ellis
Island,

00:20:04.778 --> 00:20:09.984
well surely some of them will
have been afflicted with the

00:20:09.984 --> 00:20:12.611
disease,
and there would be records

00:20:12.611 --> 00:20:15.200
there of that,
at Ellis Island.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.069
Well, as it turns out,
this was true.

00:20:18.069 --> 00:20:19.710
There were records.
 

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:26.208
Cholera did break out on a
series of emigrant-bearing ships

00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:31.000
in the summer of 1911,
and people were quarantined for

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.133
the disease--
Italians, that is,

00:20:33.133 --> 00:20:36.825
who had last been in Naples--
were quarantined for the

00:20:36.825 --> 00:20:38.529
disease on Ellis Island.
 

00:20:38.529 --> 00:20:41.719
And indeed, there had been a
number of people who were

00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:45.088
released from quarantine and
fell ill on the mainland.

00:20:45.088 --> 00:20:51.220
And, so, there are perhaps a
dozen cases of people who fell

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:57.140
sick in New York State and not
on Ellis Island itself.

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.826
So, we know that there was
then--there were Italian

00:21:00.826 --> 00:21:05.250
emigrants coming to the United
States who were afflicted with

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.430
the disease.
 

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:10.387
This led me to think,
well, I do have a project,

00:21:10.387 --> 00:21:14.009
and now the point is to prove
it further.

00:21:14.009 --> 00:21:17.480
What can I find out about its
reasons?

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.990
What are the politics of
concealment, and so on?

00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:26.784
And I was lucky then because I
was interested in a physician

00:21:26.784 --> 00:21:31.560
called Leonard Rogers,
who was one of the world's

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:37.186
experts in tropical medicine at
the early years of the twentieth

00:21:37.186 --> 00:21:38.170
century.
 

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:42.618
And it was he who in 1908 made
a major discovery.

00:21:42.618 --> 00:21:46.608
In terms of the therapeutics of
Asiatic cholera,

00:21:46.608 --> 00:21:50.867
down to 1909,
there was nothing that

00:21:50.867 --> 00:21:58.046
physicians could do that was
effective and helpful for their

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:02.076
patients,
and so the case fatality rate

00:22:02.076 --> 00:22:06.410
was something like fifty percent
for Asiatic cholera.

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:09.432
In 1908 and 1909,
Leonard Rogers,

00:22:09.432 --> 00:22:13.970
who was a British physician
working in India,

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:19.818
had found that he could reduce
the mortality from fifty to

00:22:19.818 --> 00:22:24.306
fifteen percent--
the first major advance in

00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:26.990
therapeutics--
and he did it,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:32.133
one by a simple building on
something that had been observed

00:22:32.133 --> 00:22:37.520
from the 1830s,
and that is to say that cholera

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.170
kills by dehydration.
 

00:22:40.170 --> 00:22:45.701
The bodily fluids flow out of
the rectum and the mouth through

00:22:45.701 --> 00:22:48.934
vomiting,
at an extraordinary rate,

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:53.913
so that human beings lose up to
three-quarters of the fluid

00:22:53.913 --> 00:22:56.660
portion of their blood serum.
 

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:02.088
And, so, from the 1830s onward,
one of the therapeutic ideas

00:23:02.088 --> 00:23:05.769
was why not simply replace the
fluids?

00:23:05.769 --> 00:23:10.574
There were major attempts early
on to get people to drink lots

00:23:10.574 --> 00:23:11.519
of liquid.
 

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:14.180
That doesn't work because you
simply vomit it up.

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:17.173
It has no effect,
except to make the patient

00:23:17.173 --> 00:23:17.798
weaker.
 

00:23:17.798 --> 00:23:22.318
So, having discovered that,
there were attempts by

00:23:22.318 --> 00:23:26.838
physicians to replace the fluids
intravenously.

00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:31.058
The problem early on was that
there was not a knowledge--there

00:23:31.058 --> 00:23:32.720
were several problems.
 

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.980
How much liquid do you actually
administer?

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:41.980
And many patients died of heart
failure from an excess of fluid.

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.825
It was also a time before the
discovery of the germ theory of

00:23:45.825 --> 00:23:49.809
disease,
and so although they were given

00:23:49.809 --> 00:23:55.260
drips that had clean water,
it wasn't sterile and patients

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.848
died of septicemia.
 

00:23:56.848 --> 00:24:01.078
It was also true that another
discovery,

00:24:01.078 --> 00:24:04.333
which was that the
patients--what made people

00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:08.844
persist with rehydration is that
this administration of liquid

00:24:08.844 --> 00:24:12.690
caused the patients to feel much
better briefly.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:15.240
For a few hours they seemed to
recover.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:18.608
They would sit up in their beds
and feel infinitely better.

00:24:18.608 --> 00:24:21.788
So something clearly positive
was going on.

00:24:21.788 --> 00:24:24.278
But what it was wasn't
understood.

00:24:24.278 --> 00:24:29.971
And what happened was that the
administration of fluid was

00:24:29.971 --> 00:24:36.162
trying to replace fluid that had
the same salinity as the blood

00:24:36.162 --> 00:24:37.759
in the body.
 

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:41.319
Unfortunately,
that is not retained by

00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:46.420
tissues, and it merely pours out
of the body again.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:48.808
And, so, the patient who had
momentarily,

00:24:48.808 --> 00:24:51.000
for a few hours,
felt better,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.108
relapses,
and even the continuing of this

00:24:54.108 --> 00:24:57.190
therapeutic attempt had no
positive effect.

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.568
Well, Leonard Rogers discovered
in 1909 a number of things.

00:25:01.568 --> 00:25:05.160
He measured the amount of fluid
loss.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.201
He used distilled water,
and he made it a

00:25:10.201 --> 00:25:16.628
hypertonic--that is,
much more saline than the blood

00:25:16.628 --> 00:25:17.890
fluid.
 

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.326
And the result of that was that
it was retained--through

00:25:21.326 --> 00:25:24.886
mechanisms that aren't very well
understood, the fluid was

00:25:24.886 --> 00:25:25.700
retained.
 

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.698
And, so, Leonard Rogers was
able to save the lives of the

00:25:29.698 --> 00:25:34.124
vast majority of the patients he
treated for Asiatic cholera in

00:25:34.124 --> 00:25:37.500
India,
and he wanted to--the problem

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.863
was this was a time in medical
history when there were racial

00:25:42.863 --> 00:25:46.606
ideas of disease,
and it was thought the fact

00:25:46.606 --> 00:25:51.034
that he had discovered this with
Indian bodies would have nothing

00:25:51.034 --> 00:25:53.108
to do with European bodies.
 

00:25:53.108 --> 00:25:56.678
So, partly for humanitarian
reasons and partly for

00:25:56.678 --> 00:26:01.338
scientific reasons,
he was looking for an outbreak

00:26:01.338 --> 00:26:05.801
of cholera in the West,
in which he could apply his

00:26:05.801 --> 00:26:09.910
therapeutics and demonstrate
their ability to save life,

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:11.440
any human life.
 

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.334
And in 1911,
because he was watching very

00:26:14.334 --> 00:26:17.243
closely,
he realized that there was an

00:26:17.243 --> 00:26:21.853
epidemic afoot in Italy,
and he sought permission to go

00:26:21.853 --> 00:26:27.368
to Naples to demonstrate the
efficacy of his new procedures.

00:26:27.368 --> 00:26:31.323
Soon I had Leonard--I was in
contact with Leonard Rogers'

00:26:31.323 --> 00:26:34.167
family--
and I had access to his papers,

00:26:34.167 --> 00:26:38.167
and his discussion of what
happened to him in the summer of

00:26:38.167 --> 00:26:38.720
1911.
 

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:44.282
Which was that to admit him to
the hospital at Naples to train

00:26:44.282 --> 00:26:48.974
physicians in saving lives,
the best available practice,

00:26:48.974 --> 00:26:51.700
the only therapy that had any
effect,

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:54.710
would be to admit the presence
of an epidemic.

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:58.980
And, so, he wasn't allowed to
come to mainland Italy.

00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:02.468
Instead he was allowed a
two-week visit to Sicily,

00:27:02.468 --> 00:27:04.960
where the disease spread as
well.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.518
And the Italian physicians
there called him the

00:27:07.518 --> 00:27:10.742
"prince of medicine,"
because they had a survival

00:27:10.742 --> 00:27:13.565
rate,
under his direction and his new

00:27:13.565 --> 00:27:16.854
rehydration method,
of eighty-five percent,

00:27:16.854 --> 00:27:20.818
which was extraordinary by
international standards.

00:27:20.818 --> 00:27:24.345
He had discovered the first
effective therapy,

00:27:24.345 --> 00:27:28.653
one that is in fact the basis
of present-day therapy for

00:27:28.653 --> 00:27:31.710
cholera, which is oral
rehydration.

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:34.933
Leonard Rogers' methods have
been perfected,

00:27:34.933 --> 00:27:39.660
but he was the one who found an
effective rehydration system.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:43.670
Soon we knew,
then, that the state in Italy,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:48.255
for various reasons,
was preserving a secret and

00:27:48.255 --> 00:27:52.838
denying its own citizens the
most effective,

00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:56.490
the only effective available
system of care.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:00.220
So, Leonard Rogers left Italy
in great disappointment,

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:04.451
after only being allowed to
visit the cholera wards in

00:28:04.451 --> 00:28:08.876
Sicily,
and was denied by the state the

00:28:08.876 --> 00:28:13.941
ability to visit Naples,
which was the epicenter of what

00:28:13.941 --> 00:28:14.920
was happening.
 

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.069
The next thing I was able to
discover was that the records

00:28:19.069 --> 00:28:21.928
for this epidemic--
there were records,

00:28:21.928 --> 00:28:26.053
but they existed not in the
usual places that scholars would

00:28:26.053 --> 00:28:28.500
think of to study public health.
 

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:34.963
The first files on this that I
discovered were in police

00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:36.140
records.
 

00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:41.897
And they happened in an odd
way, which was that the prime

00:28:41.897 --> 00:28:47.862
minister of Italy ordered the
state police in Italy to deal

00:28:47.862 --> 00:28:53.180
with a new offense,
which was sanitary defeatism.

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:57.715
And in order to preserve
silence and not promote sanitary

00:28:57.715 --> 00:29:01.428
defeatism,
they began tapping the

00:29:01.428 --> 00:29:05.900
telephone lines used by
physicians,

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:10.338
and censoring and opening
physicians' mail.

00:29:10.338 --> 00:29:14.973
In the city of Venice in 1911,
there were actually the police

00:29:14.973 --> 00:29:19.686
records that demonstrated the
following: which was to say that

00:29:19.686 --> 00:29:23.934
the Venice Medical Society
decided quite sensibly in the

00:29:23.934 --> 00:29:28.492
summer of 1911 that it would
save lives and enable people to

00:29:28.492 --> 00:29:34.210
protect themselves by publishing
pamphlets and distributing them,

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:38.054
about Asiatic cholera and how
you can protect yourself against

00:29:38.054 --> 00:29:38.368
it.
 

00:29:38.368 --> 00:29:43.058
And they printed thousands of
these, and wall posters as well,

00:29:43.058 --> 00:29:45.750
to put up on the walls of
Venice.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:51.779
Instead, the Medical Society
was visited by the police,

00:29:51.779 --> 00:29:56.041
who confiscated and burned all
of the pamphlets and all of the

00:29:56.041 --> 00:29:59.857
wall posters,
and told the physicians of

00:29:59.857 --> 00:30:04.353
Venice, the city,
that to propagate health and

00:30:04.353 --> 00:30:09.038
sanitary defeatism would be
fatal to their careers.

00:30:09.038 --> 00:30:15.423
So, this was all preserved in
the records of the police

00:30:15.423 --> 00:30:20.269
regarding the summer of 1911 in
Venice.

00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:28.388
The next place that I visited
then was the National Archives

00:30:28.388 --> 00:30:32.237
here,
and discovered that Italy had

00:30:32.237 --> 00:30:35.279
signed,
in 1903--and this means that

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:39.347
all of the things that I'm
telling you about marked a

00:30:39.347 --> 00:30:42.400
violation also of international
law.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:46.558
Because in 1903 there was a
Paris Sanitary Convention,

00:30:46.558 --> 00:30:53.236
which made the full disclosure
of infectious diseases mandatory

00:30:53.236 --> 00:30:55.784
for--
Italy and the United States

00:30:55.784 --> 00:30:59.390
were both signatories,
along with a series of other

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.180
countries.
 

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.406
And the physician who
represented the United States in

00:31:05.406 --> 00:31:10.240
1903, a major cholera expert
named Henry Geddings,

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.680
was now stationed at Naples
with the U.S.

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:18.170
Embassy, directing the medical
service there.

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.230
Why Naples?
 

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:23.089
Because Naples was the center
of mass emigration from Italy to

00:31:23.089 --> 00:31:25.651
the United States,
and there were health

00:31:25.651 --> 00:31:29.108
inspections that took place in
the city before departure,

00:31:29.108 --> 00:31:31.785
and Henry Geddings was
therefore in charge of

00:31:31.785 --> 00:31:35.191
protecting the health of the
United States by heading off

00:31:35.191 --> 00:31:38.838
infectious diseases before
people even boarded the ship.

00:31:38.838 --> 00:31:41.854
Well, in 1911,
there's an extensive

00:31:41.854 --> 00:31:44.892
correspondence,
and a very unhappy

00:31:44.892 --> 00:31:48.577
correspondence,
by Henry Geddings and people in

00:31:48.577 --> 00:31:52.299
the United States,
including his superiors and his

00:31:52.299 --> 00:31:54.821
family,
about his experiences in the

00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:59.075
city, where he tried to report
to the United States Government

00:31:59.075 --> 00:32:02.838
that there was a major epidemic
of Asiatic cholera.

00:32:02.838 --> 00:32:07.211
He found that his life was
threatened in the city of

00:32:07.211 --> 00:32:10.503
Naples,
and his superiors in the United

00:32:10.503 --> 00:32:14.743
States were not at all
enthusiastic about receiving his

00:32:14.743 --> 00:32:17.650
message of what was taking
place,

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.009
and so the United States
Government--

00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:24.883
you've met Walter Wyman in your
study of the bubonic plague and

00:32:24.883 --> 00:32:27.868
the Barbary plague in San
Francisco.

00:32:27.868 --> 00:32:31.883
Well, we meet him here again,
actually colluding with the

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:35.825
Italian government in the
suppression of knowledge about

00:32:35.825 --> 00:32:39.048
this important major infectious
disease,

00:32:39.048 --> 00:32:43.414
against international law that
the United States had actually

00:32:43.414 --> 00:32:44.068
signed.
 

00:32:44.068 --> 00:32:47.710
Then there were--in addition to
that,

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:52.335
I then went back to the police
files and discovered that there

00:32:52.335 --> 00:32:56.808
were also health statistics that
were coming in to Rome,

00:32:56.808 --> 00:33:00.880
reporting events in the Italian
provinces,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:05.009
and they included statistics
for Asiatic cholera.

00:33:05.009 --> 00:33:07.839
But the prefects,
who were the highest authority

00:33:07.839 --> 00:33:10.608
for law and order in each
Italian province,

00:33:10.608 --> 00:33:13.858
today as then,
were actually sending back,

00:33:13.858 --> 00:33:16.950
to help officers in the various
provinces,

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.140
the statistics they were
receiving,

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.633
saying that,
"These aren't good

00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:23.979
statistics;
we don't want them,

00:33:23.979 --> 00:33:26.368
send us something better."
 

00:33:26.368 --> 00:33:30.559
And, so, you actually see the
process by which the state

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:33.836
manufactured the health
statistics that were

00:33:33.836 --> 00:33:37.707
subsequently published,
and are the basis for the

00:33:37.707 --> 00:33:38.818
historiography.
 

00:33:38.818 --> 00:33:42.108
And you can read those
statistics in World Health

00:33:42.108 --> 00:33:45.672
Organization reports,
and Italian Government reports,

00:33:45.672 --> 00:33:46.700
and in U.S.
 

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:49.848
Government reports of the
summer of 1911.

00:33:49.848 --> 00:33:54.490
Now, why is this true and why
was this so sensitive?

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:59.368
This meant that I needed to go
back in time.

00:33:59.368 --> 00:34:04.084
My first idea was to write the
second half of the book,

00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:05.828
about concealment.
 

00:34:05.828 --> 00:34:09.181
And I'm introducing that--I
think that's important in our

00:34:09.181 --> 00:34:11.797
course--
because we're talking about

00:34:11.797 --> 00:34:14.639
various strategies of public
health,

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:19.440
and so far we've looked at
plague regulations and we've

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.219
looked at vaccine.
 

00:34:21.219 --> 00:34:26.208
But there's--as you will
remember probably from the SARS

00:34:26.208 --> 00:34:31.652
outbreak, that China practiced a
policy of concealment at the

00:34:31.652 --> 00:34:32.650
outset.
 

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:37.036
What I'm trying to say is that
concealment is also a style of

00:34:37.036 --> 00:34:38.719
public health policy.
 

00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:43.161
And I think our newspapers
rather misled us in leading us

00:34:43.161 --> 00:34:46.887
to believe that this was simply
unique to China,

00:34:46.887 --> 00:34:49.030
something very unusual.
 

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.307
I would argue as well that this
is probably something that's

00:34:52.307 --> 00:34:54.420
been resorted to a number of
times,

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.722
and this epidemic of 1911 is a
good example and a good case

00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:02.728
study in which one can find the
actual documents of the

00:35:02.728 --> 00:35:05.597
concealment,
and the reasons that it took

00:35:05.597 --> 00:35:06.000
place.
 

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Well, why this pressure?
 

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.567
Why does the prime minister of
Italy collude,

00:35:11.567 --> 00:35:15.782
and why the United States,
the Surgeon General of the

00:35:15.782 --> 00:35:19.268
United States,
also colluded with that?

00:35:19.268 --> 00:35:23.150
Indeed, I would tell you
another little anecdote,

00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:28.880
which was that Walter Wyman had
a friend who was--

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.744
friends, a couple he knew--who
were the parents of young

00:35:33.744 --> 00:35:36.429
Johnny,
who just finished his B.A.

00:35:36.429 --> 00:35:39.960
degree in 1911--I'm sorry not
here in New Haven,

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.416
but rather at that other
unmentionable place in

00:35:43.416 --> 00:35:44.920
Cambridge, Mass.
 

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.625
And having finished his degree
in 1911, as a newly minted

00:35:49.625 --> 00:35:53.489
Bachelor of Arts,
he was planning a grand tour,

00:35:53.489 --> 00:35:56.599
which was going to take in
Italy.

00:35:56.599 --> 00:36:01.268
And Italy had--this was the
fiftieth anniversary of Italian

00:36:01.268 --> 00:36:06.018
unification, and there was a
major fair with a grand U.S.

00:36:06.018 --> 00:36:09.190
pavilion, and Johnny was
planning to visit;

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:12.487
until, that is,
he got a letter from his

00:36:12.487 --> 00:36:14.010
friend, the U.S.
 

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:17.675
Surgeon General,
who wrote to Johnny's parents

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:22.320
that this trip simply wasn't on
in the summer of 1911,

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:28.739
because due to infectious
diseases it wasn't safe to visit

00:36:28.739 --> 00:36:29.639
Italy.
 

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:33.045
At the U.S. Pavilion,
also, the people,

00:36:33.045 --> 00:36:36.594
the organizers,
wrote back to Washington,

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:39.824
saying that they were
scandalized and horrified

00:36:39.824 --> 00:36:43.965
because American citizens were
not being warned that in fact

00:36:43.965 --> 00:36:47.967
there was cholera rampant in
Italy and their health was at

00:36:47.967 --> 00:36:51.244
risk,
and there was no knowledge of

00:36:51.244 --> 00:36:54.590
this and no coverage of it in
the press.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.940
Well, why would this be
happening?

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:02.157
The first thing is that by this
time there was an enormous

00:37:02.157 --> 00:37:05.909
stigma associated with Asiatic
cholera.

00:37:05.909 --> 00:37:11.688
Asiatic cholera in Western
Europe and in North America was

00:37:11.688 --> 00:37:17.164
supposedly vanquished by the
bulwarks of sanitation and

00:37:17.164 --> 00:37:18.989
public health.
 

00:37:18.989 --> 00:37:22.911
Cholera is spread by the
ingestion--in only one

00:37:22.911 --> 00:37:28.199
way--which is the ingestion of
food and water contaminated with

00:37:28.199 --> 00:37:29.650
fecal matter.
 

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:34.083
And, so, it really is an
indictment of sanitary

00:37:34.083 --> 00:37:35.239
standards.
 

00:37:35.239 --> 00:37:38.581
And therefore one of the
features was a matter of

00:37:38.581 --> 00:37:42.409
national pride for Italians not
to admit that there,

00:37:42.409 --> 00:37:46.835
in fact, there were these
deficiencies in sanitary

00:37:46.835 --> 00:37:50.927
standards,
in a nation that was supposedly

00:37:50.927 --> 00:37:54.094
advanced and,
as they would have said,

00:37:54.094 --> 00:37:54.900
civilized.
 

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.510
So, part of it then is avoiding
stigma;

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:59.800
this was an important part of
what happened.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.740
But in addition,
there was a patriotism

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.275
involved,
because this was the fiftieth

00:38:06.275 --> 00:38:09.599
anniversary of Italian
unification,

00:38:09.599 --> 00:38:12.679
and the whole world was
descending on Italy;

00:38:12.679 --> 00:38:15.420
or so it seemed,
and Italians hoped.

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:20.190
And to destroy the festivities
by putting them off,

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.833
by warning the world that
cholera was rampant in Italy at

00:38:23.833 --> 00:38:26.596
this time,
would have had enormous

00:38:26.596 --> 00:38:29.679
economic repercussions for
tourism,

00:38:29.679 --> 00:38:31.389
a major industry.
 

00:38:31.389 --> 00:38:35.376
It also would have had major
repercussions in terms of

00:38:35.376 --> 00:38:39.590
Italian pride in canceling the
whole of the celebrations,

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.170
a second feature.
 

00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:44.789
Another feature has to do--is
the fact that I've just said,

00:38:44.789 --> 00:38:49.840
that the Italian economy and
Italian standards of living were

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.639
dependent in part on the export
of people at this time.

00:38:54.639 --> 00:38:57.909
These were emigrants who came
to these shores,

00:38:57.909 --> 00:39:01.503
and to South America,
and then sent back very

00:39:01.503 --> 00:39:05.916
large-scale remittances that
were very important to the

00:39:05.916 --> 00:39:07.550
Italian economy.
 

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:12.862
And what would've happened if
the 1903 Sanitary Convention

00:39:12.862 --> 00:39:17.108
terms had been enforced,
in Italy as it should have,

00:39:17.108 --> 00:39:19.480
and was legally committed to
doing,

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.619
had announced the presence of
Asiatic cholera,

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:26.293
that would have stopped
emigration to these shores and

00:39:26.293 --> 00:39:27.610
to South America.
 

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:31.449
And that was something that
Italians did not want to risk.

00:39:31.449 --> 00:39:36.170
And this also could have had
repercussions in terms of civil

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:37.050
disorder.
 

00:39:37.050 --> 00:39:40.599
There was a fear that,
then, too--cholera,

00:39:40.599 --> 00:39:44.206
as we'll see,
is much associated with social

00:39:44.206 --> 00:39:48.521
tension and disorder,
and that was another fear that

00:39:48.521 --> 00:39:51.590
was very much in the minds of
Italians.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.949
But then there's something very
specific,

00:39:53.949 --> 00:39:57.896
and that is that--as I said in
the beginning of our talk this

00:39:57.896 --> 00:40:01.735
morning--
that Naples had been made

00:40:01.735 --> 00:40:08.219
supposedly cholera-proof after
the summer of 1884,

00:40:08.219 --> 00:40:13.869
when a catastrophic epidemic
had ravaged the city,

00:40:13.869 --> 00:40:18.940
and massive commitment of
funds--Italian but also

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:24.050
Neapolitan and from abroad--
had been devoted to this

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:25.989
rebuilding of the city.
 

00:40:25.989 --> 00:40:31.820
The problem is--I've already
said that Naples was the center

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:36.188
of the Camorra,
of a major criminal syndicate,

00:40:36.188 --> 00:40:41.193
and was a place where funds
often disappeared in mysterious

00:40:41.193 --> 00:40:42.230
channels.
 

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:48.827
And one of the features of the
rebuilding project was that the

00:40:48.827 --> 00:40:53.802
money largely went into
undisclosed and corrupt

00:40:53.802 --> 00:40:55.210
channels.
 

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:59.333
Here we have a city,
which has supposedly been built

00:40:59.333 --> 00:41:02.942
like the Titanic,
just hitting another iceberg

00:41:02.942 --> 00:41:07.175
and discovering that,
in fact, the funds that were to

00:41:07.175 --> 00:41:10.360
have made it safe have been
misspent.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:15.273
And there was an opposition to
this municipal government in

00:41:15.273 --> 00:41:20.440
Naples, which was using health
as one of the complaints of the

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.389
opposition parties.
 

00:41:22.389 --> 00:41:26.034
The opposition parties in
Naples at the time were

00:41:26.034 --> 00:41:28.920
republicans, socialists,
anarchists.

00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:33.298
And so part of the danger then,
from the standpoint of the

00:41:33.298 --> 00:41:37.856
government of the day,
was that to admit this would

00:41:37.856 --> 00:41:43.311
lead to a major local scandal,
and would, if you like,

00:41:43.311 --> 00:41:48.938
legitimate the complaints and
accusations of a radical

00:41:48.938 --> 00:41:51.380
leftwing opposition.
 

00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:56.327
So, a consideration of
political stability was also

00:41:56.327 --> 00:41:58.900
part of the calculation.
 

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.039
And this, in fact,
was a motivating factor for the

00:42:02.039 --> 00:42:05.309
U.S. Surgeon General and the
U.S. Government;

00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:10.445
that here was a friendly
government that was being

00:42:10.445 --> 00:42:14.639
lampooned and lambasted by a
radical,

00:42:14.639 --> 00:42:18.726
very left-wing opposition,
and it was better to cooperate

00:42:18.726 --> 00:42:22.657
then with the government,
the legitimate government,

00:42:22.657 --> 00:42:24.980
in the face of this opposition.
 

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:28.295
Well, this concealment then
went forward,

00:42:28.295 --> 00:42:32.690
and it was orchestrated at the
very highest levels.

00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:35.210
The press was censored.
 

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:40.911
Health defeatism actually then
became something that the police

00:42:40.911 --> 00:42:44.960
regarded as an infringement and
repressed.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.632
We've seen the way in which
physicians and public health

00:42:49.632 --> 00:42:53.710
authorities were censored and
were threatened.

00:42:53.710 --> 00:42:56.672
In addition,
it was not discussed in

00:42:56.672 --> 00:43:01.157
parliament, and it wasn't even
discussed in the Naples

00:43:01.157 --> 00:43:03.018
Municipal Council.
 

00:43:03.018 --> 00:43:06.300
And if you read the
reports--and I read the

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.597
discussions of what was being
discussed in Naples in the

00:43:10.597 --> 00:43:14.840
summer of 1911--
you see a discussion of the

00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:19.010
need for hiring lots and lots of
nurses,

00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:22.969
the need for many more doctors.
 

00:43:22.969 --> 00:43:27.574
And you see that they're
importing massive quantities of

00:43:27.574 --> 00:43:31.760
snow from the Apennines and the
Alps into the city,

00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:35.360
and it's taken to the Cotugno
Hospital.

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:39.431
And there, if you correlate
that with what the physicians

00:43:39.431 --> 00:43:42.373
were doing,
they were giving ice to cholera

00:43:42.373 --> 00:43:46.032
patients on the ward to deal
with the tremendous thirst that

00:43:46.032 --> 00:43:47.840
they had,
and to replace,

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.713
they hoped, some of the fluid
that they were losing through

00:43:51.713 --> 00:43:53.650
the course of the disease.
 

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:58.742
So, that was all--this
conspiracy then is not a casual

00:43:58.742 --> 00:43:59.320
one.
 

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:04.635
It's organized from the top
down, and is a very major and

00:44:04.635 --> 00:44:10.710
well-organized plot to conceal
the existence of this epidemic.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.983
In addition then,
what were the consequences of

00:44:13.983 --> 00:44:14.980
concealment?
 

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.757
I want to argue
that--throughout this

00:44:18.757 --> 00:44:25.159
course--that public health is
dependent on accurate and timely

00:44:25.159 --> 00:44:26.840
information.
 

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.481
We'll see that today,
in that a major feature of

00:44:31.481 --> 00:44:37.110
public health policies is
surveillance and monitoring,

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:41.179
and the availability of
information,

00:44:41.179 --> 00:44:47.802
nationally and internationally,
is vital to contain and prevent

00:44:47.802 --> 00:44:50.260
pandemic afflictions.
 

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:55.603
So, one of the features--and I
think 1911 is a good example of

00:44:55.603 --> 00:44:59.809
what happens if you don't
provide information.

00:44:59.809 --> 00:45:03.880
A first thing that happened was
that this disease spread through

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.559
many provinces of Italy.
 

00:45:05.559 --> 00:45:09.030
It was not contained
domestically.

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:12.260
Fortunately,
it did not spread to these

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:17.534
shores and to Argentina and to
other places where large numbers

00:45:17.534 --> 00:45:19.320
of Italians went.
 

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:24.309
But I think that was no thanks
to the Italian government,

00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:28.409
it had to do with serendipity
and good luck.

00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:32.135
What I could say was that the
Italian government,

00:45:32.135 --> 00:45:34.619
with the collusion of the U.S.
 

00:45:34.619 --> 00:45:38.958
government, was placing the
health of this country,

00:45:38.958 --> 00:45:43.559
and the health of Argentina in
particular, at risk.

00:45:43.559 --> 00:45:48.978
It was placing at risk the
health also of international

00:45:48.978 --> 00:45:53.896
visitors to Italy,
tourists and people who came to

00:45:53.896 --> 00:45:57.210
see the celebrations of 1911.
 

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:02.496
And one of the truly
unfortunate parts of the

00:46:02.496 --> 00:46:09.586
concealment effects is that it
led to thousands of deaths of

00:46:09.586 --> 00:46:11.150
Italians.
 

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:15.659
Because the patients on the
wards of the Cotugno Hospital,

00:46:15.659 --> 00:46:21.393
and elsewhere in Italy,
were systematically denied what

00:46:21.393 --> 00:46:27.130
was then the best available
international practice,

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.909
which is the administration of
rehydration therapy,

00:46:30.909 --> 00:46:35.244
as developed by Leonard Rogers,
and Italian doctors weren't

00:46:35.244 --> 00:46:39.802
allowed to know that this was
the state-of-the-art and the way

00:46:39.802 --> 00:46:43.690
in which it was possible to save
Italian lives,

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:47.460
reducing mortality from fifty
to fifteen percent,

00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:48.730
or something like that.
 

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:53.458
If you look at the Cotugno
ward, what were the physicians

00:46:53.458 --> 00:46:54.809
doing instead?
 

00:46:54.809 --> 00:46:57.746
Well, instead,
because cholera patients become

00:46:57.746 --> 00:47:01.989
tremendously cold and look as
though they've been cadaverized,

00:47:01.989 --> 00:47:07.030
they were immersing cholera
patients in hot tubs.

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:11.414
Because for the same way as
their energy was failing,

00:47:11.414 --> 00:47:15.800
they were administering them
stimulants, caffeine.

00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:18.494
And there were various
experiments with other things

00:47:18.494 --> 00:47:21.414
that were meant--
because there wasn't a therapy

00:47:21.414 --> 00:47:24.655
that was known to work,
there were lots of experimental

00:47:24.655 --> 00:47:26.409
therapies that were being tried.
 

00:47:26.409 --> 00:47:30.309
Strychnine, which you know
better as rat poison,

00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:33.389
was also administered to
cholera patients,

00:47:33.389 --> 00:47:38.489
in an attempt to revive their
energy and their flagging

00:47:38.489 --> 00:47:39.340
health.
 

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:45.800
Also there were attempts at
rehydration therapy.

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.590
But this took the form that was
now outdated,

00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:54.768
after 1908, of trying to get
the patients to suck on ice,

00:47:54.768 --> 00:48:01.643
or to drink,
or to be injected with isotonic

00:48:01.643 --> 00:48:07.173
saline solutions;
that is, of the same content of

00:48:07.173 --> 00:48:10.956
salt, same salinity as the
blood, which by 1908,

00:48:10.956 --> 00:48:14.739
through a century of
experience, was known to be

00:48:14.739 --> 00:48:16.510
entirely useless.
 

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:20.452
And these were the kinds of
therapies that were being

00:48:20.452 --> 00:48:24.170
practiced, plus simply
supportive nursing care.

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:27.045
And as I said,
the hospital was recruiting

00:48:27.045 --> 00:48:29.219
very large numbers of nurses.
 

00:48:29.219 --> 00:48:33.452
So, nursing care and various
experimental and sometimes

00:48:33.452 --> 00:48:38.389
heroic interventions that led to
a very high mortality rate,

00:48:38.389 --> 00:48:43.277
when in fact it was possible to
save about eighty-five percent

00:48:43.277 --> 00:48:44.400
of patients.
 

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.666
Well, I've run out of time,
and so I'll just say then that

00:48:48.666 --> 00:48:52.110
this is how this particular book
came to be.

00:48:52.110 --> 00:48:56.623
And I ended up writing,
adding on, that in order to

00:48:56.623 --> 00:49:00.530
understand 1911,
it was absolutely crucial to

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:04.050
see 1884 and the steps that had
been taken,

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:06.592
unfortunately not so
successfully,

00:49:06.592 --> 00:49:11.449
to make Naples cholera-proof by
the early twentieth century,

00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:13.469
when sadly it wasn't.
 

00:49:13.469 --> 00:49:17.509
And I think there's a story
there of concealment as a public

00:49:17.509 --> 00:49:21.411
health policy that I wanted to
alert you to as yet another

00:49:21.411 --> 00:49:25.349
style of public health,
and one that has very--it's not

00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:29.340
good for your health--
and has very dire consequences.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:34.000

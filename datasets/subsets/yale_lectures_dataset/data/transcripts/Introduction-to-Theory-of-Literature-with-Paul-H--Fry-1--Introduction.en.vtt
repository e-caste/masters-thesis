00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.233
Prof: I thought I'd
begin today--this

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:04.910
&lt;&lt;gestures to outline on
chalkboard&gt;&gt;

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.710
is, by the way,
the regular practice.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.470
This is as close as I get to
bulleted Power Point.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.880
It's all there.
 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.929
I ought to have got through
those topics by the end of the

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:17.640
lecture.
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.540
If I don't, not to worry.
 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.308
I'll pick up wherever the
dotted line emerges in the

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:24.860
subsequent lecture.
 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.546
In any case,
I thought I'd begin today by

00:00:27.546 --> 00:00:31.575
making a few remarks about the
title of our course because it

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:34.463
has some big words in it:
"theory"

00:00:34.463 --> 00:00:36.813
and "literature,"
but also

00:00:36.813 --> 00:00:39.030
"introduction."
 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.698
I think it's worth saying a
word or two about the word

00:00:41.698 --> 00:00:43.460
"introduction"
as well.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.633
Now the word theory has
a very complicated etymological

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:50.370
history that I won't trouble you
with.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.558
The trouble with the etymology
of theory and the way in

00:00:53.558 --> 00:00:56.641
which the word has been used
traditionally is that sometimes

00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:58.680
it actually means
practice,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.823
and then at other historical
periods it means something very

00:01:02.823 --> 00:01:07.319
different from practice,
something typically from which

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:09.140
practice is derived.
 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.260
Well, that's the sense of
theory that I like to work with,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.590
and I would pause over it by
saying that after all,

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.414
there is a difference and
practice and we shouldn't too

00:01:19.414 --> 00:01:21.330
quickly,
at least, confuse the terms.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.810
There's a difference between
theory and methodology.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.614
Yes, it's probably fair enough
to say that methodology is

00:01:29.614 --> 00:01:33.453
applied theory,
but there's a great danger in

00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:37.643
supposing that every aspect of
theory has an immediate

00:01:37.643 --> 00:01:38.830
application.
 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.239
Theory is very often a purely
speculative undertaking.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:48.303
It's an hypothesis about
something, the exact nature of

00:01:48.303 --> 00:01:51.690
which one needn't necessarily
have in view.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.272
It's a supposition that
whatever the object of theory

00:01:55.272 --> 00:01:57.745
might be,
theory itself must--owing to

00:01:57.745 --> 00:02:00.799
whatever intellectual
constraints one can imagine--

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.209
be of such and such a form.
 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.247
At this level of abstraction,
plainly there isn't all that

00:02:08.247 --> 00:02:12.580
much incentive to apply thinking
of that kind,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.752
but on the other hand
undoubtedly theory does exist

00:02:16.752 --> 00:02:19.590
for the most part to be applied.
 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.316
Very frequently,
courses of this kind have a

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:26.366
text--
Lycidas, The Rime of the

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:30.133
Ancient Mariner,
a short story--and

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:34.372
then once in a while the
disquisition of the lecture will

00:02:34.372 --> 00:02:36.866
pause,
the text will be produced,

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:40.473
and whatever theory has
recently been talked about will

00:02:40.473 --> 00:02:43.116
be applied to the text;
so that you'll get a

00:02:43.116 --> 00:02:45.878
postcolonial reading of The
Rime of the Ancient Mariner--

00:02:45.878 --> 00:02:47.764
something,
by the way, which is absolutely

00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:49.229
fascinating and important to
do--

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.598
and so on through the course.
 

00:02:52.598 --> 00:02:56.620
Now I suppose it's my
reluctance to get into the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.838
intricacies of questions having
to do with applied theory that

00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:05.090
makes me prefer to keep it
simple.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.701
Our text is a story for
toddlers called Tony the Tow

00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:12.568
Truck.
 

00:03:12.568 --> 00:03:15.211
I've decided not to pass it
out today because,

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:17.960
after all, I want to get it
into the right hands!

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.628
You can't read it unless you
take the course!--and so I'm

00:03:21.628 --> 00:03:23.530
going to wait a little bit.
 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.900
&lt;&lt;holds up the
text&gt;&gt;

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.020
We won't come back to it at
least for the moment,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.300
but you see that it's
mercifully short,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.661
and as time passes we will do
some rather interesting tricks

00:03:35.661 --> 00:03:36.568
with it.
 

00:03:36.568 --> 00:03:38.694
We will revert,
as others revert to

00:03:38.694 --> 00:03:42.071
Lycidas, to
Tony the Tow Truck for

00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:45.758
the purpose of introducing
questions of applied theory.

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:49.748
Now this choice may suggest a
certain condescension both

00:03:49.748 --> 00:03:52.506
toward theory and toward
literary text,

00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:54.900
which is not at all intended.
 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.863
It's much more a question of
reminding you that if you can do

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.770
it with this,
you can do it with anything;

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:07.502
but also of reminding you that,
after all, reading--reading

00:04:07.502 --> 00:04:13.335
just anything--is a complex and
potentially almost unlimited

00:04:13.335 --> 00:04:14.620
activity.
 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.860
That's one of the good things
that theory teaches us and that

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.927
I hope to be able to get across
in the course of our varied

00:04:24.927 --> 00:04:28.860
approaches to Tony the Tow
Truck.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.394
Now theory resembles philosophy
perhaps in this:

00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:38.315
that it asks fundamental
questions and also at times

00:04:38.315 --> 00:04:40.149
builds systems.
 

00:04:40.149 --> 00:04:43.822
That is to say,
theory has certain ambitions to

00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:48.692
a totalization of what can be
thought that resembles or rivals

00:04:48.692 --> 00:04:49.889
philosophy.
 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.250
But theory differs from
philosophy--

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.425
and this is something that I'm
going to be coming back to

00:04:56.425 --> 00:05:00.975
persistingly in the second half
of this lecture and many times

00:05:00.975 --> 00:05:05.151
hereafter: theory differs from
most philosophy in that it

00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:07.997
involves a certain--
this is by no means

00:05:07.997 --> 00:05:09.815
self-evident,
and "Why should this

00:05:09.815 --> 00:05:10.389
be?"
 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.519
is one of the questions we're
going to be asking--it involves

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.720
a certain skepticism.
 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.160
There seems to be a doubt,
a variety of doubts,

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.603
about the foundations of what
we can think and the basis of

00:05:23.603 --> 00:05:26.351
our opinions,
that pervades theory,

00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:30.699
and is seen somehow or another
to characterize its history.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:35.079
Not all theory that we read in
this course is skeptical.

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:39.098
Some of the most powerful and
profound thought that's been

00:05:39.098 --> 00:05:43.399
devoted to the subject of the
theory of literature is positive

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:46.220
in its intentions and in its
views,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.557
but by and large you will
happily or unhappily come to

00:05:50.557 --> 00:05:55.716
terms with the fact that much of
what you're going to be reading

00:05:55.716 --> 00:05:59.598
this semester is undergirded,
or perhaps I should say

00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:04.550
undermined,
by this persisting skepticism.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.120
It's crucial,
as I say, and I'm going to be

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.117
coming back to it,
but it's just a point I want to

00:06:10.117 --> 00:06:13.240
make in passing about the nature
of theory now.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.718
Turning to the word
literature,

00:06:15.718 --> 00:06:19.002
this is not theory of
relativity, theory of music,

00:06:19.002 --> 00:06:20.879
or theory of government.
 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.232
This is a course in theory of
literature, and theory of

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:30.228
literature shares in common with
other kinds of theory the need

00:06:30.228 --> 00:06:31.759
for definition.
 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.680
That is to say,
maybe the most central and,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.644
for me, possibly the most
fascinating question theory asks

00:06:38.644 --> 00:06:40.940
is--well, what is literature?
 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.040
How do we know it when we see
it?

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.389
How can we define it?
 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:48.387
Much of what we'll be reading
takes up the question "What

00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:49.470
is literature?"
 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.274
and provides us with
fascinating and always--for the

00:06:53.274 --> 00:06:56.259
moment, I think--enticing
definitions.

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:59.980
There are definitions based on
form, circularity,

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:03.857
symmetry, economy of form,
lack of economy of form,

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.329
and repetition.
 

00:07:05.329 --> 00:07:09.420
There are definitions based on
psychological complexity,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.670
psychological balance,
psychological harmony,

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.240
sometimes psychological
imbalance and disharmony,

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.696
and there are also definitions
which insist that somehow there

00:07:20.696 --> 00:07:25.079
is an epistemological difference
between literature and other

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.759
kinds of utterance.
 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:30.619
Whereas most utterances purport
to be saying something true

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:33.879
about the actual state of things
in the world,

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:37.769
literary utterance is under no
such obligation,

00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:40.653
the argument goes,
and ought properly to be

00:07:40.653 --> 00:07:45.103
understood as fiction--
making it up as opposed to

00:07:45.103 --> 00:07:46.259
referring.
 

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:47.129
All right.
 

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:49.360
Now all of these definitions
have had currency.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.507
We'll be going over them again
and finding them,

00:07:53.507 --> 00:07:58.360
I hope, more fascinating as we
learn more about them;

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.127
but at the same time,
even as I rattle off this list

00:08:02.127 --> 00:08:05.526
of possibilities,
probably you felt in yourself

00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:07.670
an upsurge of skepticism.
 

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:08.819
You say, "My goodness.
 

00:08:08.819 --> 00:08:11.430
I can easily find exceptions to
all of those rules.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:15.194
It's ridiculous to think that
literature could be defined in

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:19.278
any one of those ways or even in
a combination of all of them.

00:08:19.278 --> 00:08:22.377
Literature is many things,
a many-splendored thing,"

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:25.591
you say to yourself,
"and it simply cannot be

00:08:25.591 --> 00:08:29.610
confined or trapped within a
definition of that kind."

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.038
Well and good,
properly ecumenical of you,

00:08:33.038 --> 00:08:37.451
but at the same time it gives
rise to a sense that possibly

00:08:37.451 --> 00:08:40.621
after all,
literature just isn't anything

00:08:40.621 --> 00:08:42.950
at all:
in other words,

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:47.220
that literature may not be
susceptible of definition,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.990
of any one definition,
but it is rather--

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:54.379
and this is the so-called
neo-pragmatist argument--

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:59.563
but it is rather whatever you
think it is or more precisely

00:08:59.563 --> 00:09:04.480
whatever your interpretive
community says that it is.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.808
This isn't really a big problem.
 

00:09:06.808 --> 00:09:09.928
It's kind of unsettling because
we like to know what things are,

00:09:09.928 --> 00:09:14.081
but at the same time it's not
really a big problem because as

00:09:14.081 --> 00:09:17.817
long as we know about the fact
that a certain notion of

00:09:17.817 --> 00:09:21.000
literature exists in certain
communities,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.788
we can begin to do very
interesting work precisely with

00:09:24.788 --> 00:09:25.629
that idea.
 

00:09:25.629 --> 00:09:31.488
We can say there's a great deal
to learn about what people think

00:09:31.488 --> 00:09:36.788
literature is and we can develop
very interesting kinds of

00:09:36.788 --> 00:09:42.182
thinking about the variety of
ways in which these ideas are

00:09:42.182 --> 00:09:43.668
expressed.
 

00:09:43.668 --> 00:09:46.466
And so it's not,
perhaps, crippling if this is

00:09:46.466 --> 00:09:49.759
the conclusion we reach,
but at the same time it's not

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:51.808
the only possible conclusion.
 

00:09:51.808 --> 00:09:54.350
The possibility of definition
persists.

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.390
Definition is important to us,
and we're certainly not going

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:01.200
to give it short shrift in this
course.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:06.200
We're going to make every
effort to define literature as

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.200
carefully as we can.
 

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.205
Now in addition to defining
literature, literary theory also

00:10:12.205 --> 00:10:16.210
asks questions obviously not
unrelated but which open up the

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:17.500
field somewhat.
 

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:23.340
What causes literature and what
are the effects of literature?

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.948
In a way, there's a subset of
questions that arises from

00:10:26.948 --> 00:10:28.730
those,
and as to causes these are,

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.907
of course,
what we'll be taking up next

00:10:30.907 --> 00:10:33.850
time: the question "What is
an author?"

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:36.178
That is to say,
if something causes literature,

00:10:36.178 --> 00:10:40.256
there must be some sort of
authority behind it and

00:10:40.256 --> 00:10:43.419
therefore we find ourselves
asking,

00:10:43.419 --> 00:10:45.019
"What is an author?"
 

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:47.678
By the same token,
if literature has effects,

00:10:47.678 --> 00:10:51.058
it must have effects on
someone, and this gives rise to

00:10:51.058 --> 00:10:54.000
the equally interesting and
vexing question,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.840
"What is a reader?"
 

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.225
Literary theory is very much
involved with questions of that

00:11:00.225 --> 00:11:03.027
kind,
and organizing those questions

00:11:03.027 --> 00:11:07.590
is basically what rationalizes
the structure of our syllabus.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.340
You'll notice that we move in
the syllabus--

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.697
after a couple of introductory
talks that I'll mention in a

00:11:14.697 --> 00:11:17.976
minute--
we move from the idea that

00:11:17.976 --> 00:11:23.518
literature is in some sense
caused by language to the idea

00:11:23.518 --> 00:11:29.740
that literature is in some sense
caused by the human psyche,

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.529
to the idea that literature is
in some sense caused by social,

00:11:34.529 --> 00:11:37.740
economic, and historical forces.
 

00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:43.066
There are corollaries for those
ideas in terms of the kinds of

00:11:43.066 --> 00:11:48.479
effects that literature has and
what we might imagine ourselves

00:11:48.479 --> 00:11:50.750
to conclude from them.
 

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:55.019
Finally, literary theory asks
one other important question--

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:57.178
it asks many,
but this is the way at least

00:11:57.178 --> 00:12:00.265
I'm organizing it for today--
it asks one other important

00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:02.400
question,
the one with which we will

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.890
actually begin:
not so much "What is a

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:05.840
reader?"
 

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.600
but "How does reading get
done?"

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.769
That is to say,
how do we form the conclusion

00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:15.298
that we are interpreting
something adequately,

00:12:15.298 --> 00:12:18.634
that we have a basis for the
kind of reading that we're

00:12:18.634 --> 00:12:19.129
doing?
 

00:12:19.129 --> 00:12:21.428
What is the reading experience
like?

00:12:21.428 --> 00:12:27.000
How do we meet the text
face-to-face?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.192
How do we put ourselves in
touch with the text which may

00:12:31.192 --> 00:12:35.080
after all in a variety of ways
be remote from us?

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.034
These are the questions that
are asked by what's called

00:12:39.034 --> 00:12:42.111
hermeneutics,
a difficult word that we will

00:12:42.111 --> 00:12:44.090
be taking up next week.
 

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:48.231
It has to do with the god
Hermes who conveyed language to

00:12:48.231 --> 00:12:49.801
man,
who was in a certain sense,

00:12:49.801 --> 00:12:52.764
among many other functions,
the god of communication,

00:12:52.764 --> 00:12:56.351
and hermeneutics is,
after all, obviously about

00:12:56.351 --> 00:12:57.490
communication.
 

00:12:57.490 --> 00:13:02.264
So hermeneutics will be our
first topic, and it attempts to

00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:07.124
answer the last question that
I've mentioned which is raised

00:13:07.124 --> 00:13:09.429
by theory of literature.
 

00:13:09.429 --> 00:13:10.528
All right.
 

00:13:10.528 --> 00:13:15.120
Now let me pause quickly over
the word introduction.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:19.793
I first started teaching this
course in the late 1970s and 80s

00:13:19.793 --> 00:13:24.389
when literary theory was a thing
absolutely of the moment.

00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:28.937
As I told the teaching fellows,
I had a colleague in those days

00:13:28.937 --> 00:13:33.412
who looked at me enviously and
said he wished he had the black

00:13:33.412 --> 00:13:35.980
leather concession at the door.
 

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.976
Theory was both hot and cool,
and it was something about

00:13:40.976 --> 00:13:46.062
which, following from that,
one had not just opinions but

00:13:46.062 --> 00:13:48.879
very, very strong opinions.
 

00:13:48.879 --> 00:13:51.028
In other words,
the teaching fellows I had in

00:13:51.028 --> 00:13:52.200
those days--who knows?
 

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.139
They may rise up against me in
the same way this semester--

00:13:55.139 --> 00:13:57.330
but the teaching fellows I had
in those days said,

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.950
"You can't teach an
introduction.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.298
You can't teach a survey.
 

00:14:02.298 --> 00:14:03.971
You can't say,
'If it's Tuesday,

00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:05.158
it must be Foucault.
 

00:14:05.158 --> 00:14:07.600
If it's Thursday,
it must be Lacan.'

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.149
You can't approach theory that
way.

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:11.893
Theory is important and it's
important to know what you

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:13.570
believe,"
in other words,

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.571
what the basis of all other
possible theory is."I am a

00:14:17.571 --> 00:14:18.330
feminist.
 

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.500
I'm a Lacanian.
 

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.028
I am a student of Paul de Man.
 

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:26.750
I believe that these are the
foundational moments of

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:31.053
theorizing and that if you're
going to teach anything like a

00:14:31.053 --> 00:14:33.577
survey,
you've got to derive the rest

00:14:33.577 --> 00:14:36.988
of it from whatever the moment I
happen to subscribe to might

00:14:36.988 --> 00:14:37.668
be."
 

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:42.029
That's the way it felt to teach
theory in those days.

00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:44.532
It was awkward teaching an
introduction and probably for

00:14:44.532 --> 00:14:46.168
that reason
&gt;

00:14:46.168 --> 00:14:49.861
while I was teaching Lit 300,
which was then called Lit Y,

00:14:49.861 --> 00:14:52.000
Paul de Man was teaching Lit Z.
 

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.921
He was teaching a lecture
course nearby,

00:14:55.921 --> 00:15:00.748
not at the same time,
which was interpretation as

00:15:00.748 --> 00:15:04.570
practiced by the School of de
Man.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:07.921
That was Lit Z,
and it did indeed imply every

00:15:07.921 --> 00:15:11.727
other form of theory,
and it was extremely rigorous

00:15:11.727 --> 00:15:15.080
and interesting,
but it wasn't a survey.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.687
It took for granted,
in other words,

00:15:17.687 --> 00:15:21.639
that everything else would
derive from the fundamental

00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:24.057
idea;
but it didn't for a minute

00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:27.886
think that a whole series of
fundamental ideas could share

00:15:27.886 --> 00:15:30.524
space,
could be a kind of smorgasbord

00:15:30.524 --> 00:15:34.389
that you could mix and match in
a kind of happy-go-lucky,

00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:37.085
eclectic way,
which perhaps we will be

00:15:37.085 --> 00:15:41.529
seeming to do from time to time
in our introductory course.

00:15:41.529 --> 00:15:45.508
Well, does one feel any
nostalgia now for the coolness

00:15:45.508 --> 00:15:47.460
and heat of this moment?
 

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.330
Yes and no.
 

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:54.558
It was fascinating to be--as
Wordsworth says,

00:15:54.558 --> 00:15:58.509
"Bliss was it in that dawn
to be alive"--

00:15:58.509 --> 00:16:02.325
to be around in those days,
but at the same time I think

00:16:02.325 --> 00:16:06.139
it's rather advantageous for us
too to be still "in

00:16:06.139 --> 00:16:07.320
theory."
 

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.308
That is to say we still have
views.

00:16:10.308 --> 00:16:14.591
We still have to recognize that
what we think derives from this

00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:18.803
or that understanding of theory
and these or those theoretical

00:16:18.803 --> 00:16:19.840
principles.
 

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:23.240
We have to understand the way
in which what we do and say,

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.480
what we write in our papers and
articles,

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.490
is grounded in theoretical
premises which,

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:31.028
if we don't come to terms with
them,

00:16:31.028 --> 00:16:34.770
we will simply naively
reproduce without being fully

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.779
aware of how we're using them
and how,

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:39.658
indeed, they are using us.
 

00:16:39.658 --> 00:16:43.879
So it is as crucial as ever to
understand theory.

00:16:43.879 --> 00:16:47.441
In addition,
we have the vantage point of,

00:16:47.441 --> 00:16:51.090
I suppose, what we can now call
history.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:57.138
Some of what we'll be studying
is no longer practiced as that

00:16:57.138 --> 00:17:01.976
which is the absolutely
necessary central path to

00:17:01.976 --> 00:17:03.590
methodology.
 

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:07.740
Some of what we're studying has
had its moment of flourishing,

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.557
has remained influential as a
paradigm that shapes other

00:17:11.557 --> 00:17:14.093
paradigms,
but is not itself,

00:17:14.093 --> 00:17:17.269
perhaps, today the sole
paradigm--

00:17:17.269 --> 00:17:20.730
which gives us the opportunity
of historical perspective,

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:24.130
so that from time to time
during the course of the course,

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:27.849
I'll be trying to say something
about why certain theoretical

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:31.075
issues and ideas pushed
themselves into prominence at

00:17:31.075 --> 00:17:35.246
certain historical moments,
and that too then can become

00:17:35.246 --> 00:17:37.118
part of our enterprise.
 

00:17:37.118 --> 00:17:40.605
So an introduction is not only
valuable for those of us who

00:17:40.605 --> 00:17:42.710
simply wish to acquire
knowledge.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:45.471
It's also valuable,
I think, in lending an

00:17:45.471 --> 00:17:49.111
additional perspective to the
topic of theory and to an

00:17:49.111 --> 00:17:51.740
understanding about how theory
is,

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:54.608
on the one hand and perhaps in
a certain sense,

00:17:54.608 --> 00:17:59.519
now an historical topic and is,
on the other hand,

00:17:59.519 --> 00:18:04.172
something that we're very much
engaged in and still committed

00:18:04.172 --> 00:18:08.435
to: so all that then by way of
rationale for teaching an

00:18:08.435 --> 00:18:10.529
introduction to theory.
 

00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:12.140
All right.
 

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.605
Now the question,
"How does literary theory

00:18:16.605 --> 00:18:20.690
relate to the history of
criticism?"

00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:23.470
That is a course that I like to
teach, too;

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:27.239
usually I teach Plato to
T.S. Eliot or Plato to

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:31.828
I.A. Richards or some other
important figure in the early

00:18:31.828 --> 00:18:33.960
twentieth century.
 

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.416
It's a course which is
absolutely fascinating in all

00:18:37.416 --> 00:18:40.308
sorts of ways,
and it has one very important

00:18:40.308 --> 00:18:43.608
thing in common with literary
theory: that is to say,

00:18:43.608 --> 00:18:48.259
literary criticism is,
too, perpetually concerned with

00:18:48.259 --> 00:18:50.980
the definition of literature.
 

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:55.046
Many of the issues that I
raised in talking about defining

00:18:55.046 --> 00:18:59.326
literature are as relevant for
literary criticism as they are

00:18:59.326 --> 00:19:02.958
for literary theory,
and yet we all instinctively

00:19:02.958 --> 00:19:06.390
know that these are two very
different enterprises.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.019
Literary theory loses something
that literary criticism just

00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:12.588
takes for granted.
 

00:19:12.588 --> 00:19:17.107
Literary theory is not
concerned with issues of

00:19:17.107 --> 00:19:22.707
evaluation, and it's not really
concerned with concomitant

00:19:22.707 --> 00:19:25.358
issues of appreciation.
 

00:19:25.358 --> 00:19:31.152
Literary theory just takes
those for granted as part of the

00:19:31.152 --> 00:19:34.680
sense experience,
as one might say,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:39.298
of any reader and prefers,
rather, to dwell on questions

00:19:39.298 --> 00:19:43.421
of description,
analysis and speculation,

00:19:43.421 --> 00:19:45.038
as I've said.
 

00:19:45.038 --> 00:19:48.537
So that's what's lost in
theory, but what's new in

00:19:48.537 --> 00:19:49.180
theory?
 

00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:52.924
Here I come to the topic which
will occupy most of my attention

00:19:52.924 --> 00:19:55.038
for the remainder of the
lecture.

00:19:55.038 --> 00:19:59.772
What's new in theory is the
element of skepticism that

00:19:59.772 --> 00:20:02.900
literary criticism by and
large--

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.589
which is usually affirming a
canon of some sort--

00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:08.670
doesn't reflect.
 

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.124
Literary theory,
as I say, is skeptical about

00:20:12.124 --> 00:20:16.048
the foundations of its subject
matter and also,

00:20:16.048 --> 00:20:19.469
in many cases,
about the foundations of what

00:20:19.469 --> 00:20:21.140
it itself is doing.
 

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.901
So the question is:
how on earth did this come

00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:25.568
about?
 

00:20:25.568 --> 00:20:29.211
It's an historical question,
as I say, and I want to devote

00:20:29.211 --> 00:20:31.220
the rest of the lecture to it.
 

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:36.669
Why should doubt about the
veridical or truth-affirming

00:20:36.669 --> 00:20:42.118
possibilities of interpretation
be so widespread in the

00:20:42.118 --> 00:20:44.338
twentieth century?
 

00:20:44.338 --> 00:20:48.950
Now here is a big glop of
intellectual history.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.429
I think the sort of skepticism
I mean arises from what one

00:20:52.429 --> 00:20:55.420
might call and what often is
called modernity--

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.400
not to be confused with
Modernism, an early

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.925
twentieth-century phenomenon,
but the history of modern

00:21:00.925 --> 00:21:05.039
thought as it usually derives
from the generation of

00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:08.288
Descartes,
Shakespeare, and Cervantes.

00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:11.201
Notice something about all of
those figures:

00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:15.262
Shakespeare is preoccupied with
figures who may or may not be

00:21:15.262 --> 00:21:15.940
crazy.
 

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.201
Cervantes is preoccupied with a
figure who is crazy--we're

00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:23.640
pretty sure of that,
but he certainly isn't.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.624
He takes it for granted that he
is the most rational and

00:21:28.624 --> 00:21:33.788
systematic of all thinkers and
raises questions about--

00:21:33.788 --> 00:21:36.078
since we all take ourselves to
be rational too--

00:21:36.078 --> 00:21:40.230
raises questions about just how
we know ourselves not to be

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.950
paranoid delusives like Don
Quixote.

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.838
So that can be unsettling when
we think of this as happening at

00:21:47.838 --> 00:21:52.650
a certain contemporaneous moment
in the history of thought.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.358
Now Descartes,
you remember,

00:21:54.358 --> 00:21:57.715
in his Meditations
begins by asking a series of

00:21:57.715 --> 00:22:00.630
questions about how we can know
anything,

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.480
and one of the skeptical
questions he asks is,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.240
"Well, might I not be
crazy?"

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.092
In other words,
Descartes is still thinking

00:22:08.092 --> 00:22:09.788
along these same lines.
 

00:22:09.788 --> 00:22:12.496
He says, "Well,
maybe I've been seized by an

00:22:12.496 --> 00:22:15.710
evil genius of some kind or
maybe I'm just crazy."

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.967
Now why--and here is the
question--why do we get this

00:22:19.967 --> 00:22:24.306
nervousness about the
relationship between what I know

00:22:24.306 --> 00:22:27.990
and how I know it arising at
this moment?

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.125
Well, I think it's
characterized at least in part

00:22:31.125 --> 00:22:35.108
by what Descartes goes on to say
in his Meditations.

00:22:35.108 --> 00:22:37.750
Descartes settles the
matter--perhaps somewhat

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.095
sweeping the question of whether
he is crazy under the rug

00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:44.440
because I'm still not sure he
answers that question--

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.750
but he settles the matter
famously by saying,

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.269
"I think.
 

00:22:48.269 --> 00:22:49.970
Therefore, I am,"
and furthermore,

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:51.358
as a concomitant,
"I think,

00:22:51.358 --> 00:22:55.173
therefore, all the things that
I'm thinking about can be

00:22:55.173 --> 00:22:57.670
understood to exist as
well."

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:02.003
Now the Cartesian Revolution
establishes something that is

00:23:02.003 --> 00:23:06.490
absolutely crucial for what we
call the Enlightenment of the

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:09.190
next hundred,
hundred and fifty years--in

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.161
other words,
the idea that there is a

00:23:11.161 --> 00:23:14.578
distance between the mind and
the things that it thinks about,

00:23:14.578 --> 00:23:17.910
but that this distance is a
good thing.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:20.630
In other words,
if you look too closely at a

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:24.426
picture or if you stand too far
away from it you don't see it

00:23:24.426 --> 00:23:26.814
clearly--
it's out of focus--but if you

00:23:26.814 --> 00:23:29.079
achieve just the right distance
from it,

00:23:29.079 --> 00:23:31.528
it comes into focus.
 

00:23:31.528 --> 00:23:34.868
The idea of scientific
objectivity,

00:23:34.868 --> 00:23:37.647
the idea that motivates the
creation of the great

00:23:37.647 --> 00:23:40.368
Encyclopedia by the
figures of the French

00:23:40.368 --> 00:23:44.099
Enlightenment--
this idea all arises out of the

00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:49.020
idea that there is a certain
appropriate objective distance

00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.670
between the perceiver and the
perceived.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:57.626
Gradually, however,
the idea that this distance is

00:23:57.626 --> 00:24:03.088
not too great begins to erode so
that in 1796 Kant,

00:24:03.088 --> 00:24:06.319
who isn't exactly enlisted on
the side of the skeptics by most

00:24:06.319 --> 00:24:10.269
of his serious students,
nevertheless does say something

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:14.983
equally famous as that which
Descartes said and a good deal

00:24:14.983 --> 00:24:18.722
more disturbing:
"We cannot know the thing

00:24:18.722 --> 00:24:20.430
in itself."
 

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:23.788
Now as I said,
Kant erected such an incredibly

00:24:23.788 --> 00:24:27.818
magnificent scaffolding around
the thing in itself--

00:24:27.818 --> 00:24:30.416
that is to say,
the variety of ways in which

00:24:30.416 --> 00:24:33.624
although we can't know it,
we can sort of triangulate it

00:24:33.624 --> 00:24:35.529
and come to terms with it
obliquely--

00:24:35.529 --> 00:24:39.259
that it seems churlish to
enlist him on the side of the

00:24:39.259 --> 00:24:42.576
skeptics,
but at the same time there's a

00:24:42.576 --> 00:24:46.884
sense of a danger in the
distance between subject and

00:24:46.884 --> 00:24:51.608
object that begins to emerge in
thinking of this kind.

00:24:51.608 --> 00:24:54.789
Now by 1807,
Hegel in The Phenomenology

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:59.211
of Mind is saying that in
recent history and in recent

00:24:59.211 --> 00:25:03.711
developments of consciousness
something unfortunate has set

00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:04.410
in.
 

00:25:04.410 --> 00:25:07.532
We have "unhappy
consciousness,"

00:25:07.532 --> 00:25:12.180
unhappy consciousness which is
the result of estrangement,

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:15.587
or Verfremdung,
and which drives us too far

00:25:15.587 --> 00:25:18.650
away from the thing that we're
looking at.

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:22.785
We are no longer certain at all
of what we're looking at,

00:25:22.785 --> 00:25:26.329
and consciousness,
therefore, feels alienated.

00:25:26.329 --> 00:25:27.019
All right.
 

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:30.922
So you can already begin to see
a development in intellectual

00:25:30.922 --> 00:25:34.890
history that perhaps opens the
way to a certain skepticism.

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.279
But the crucial thing hasn't
yet happened,

00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:41.250
because after all,
in all of these accounts,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.501
even that of Hegel,
there is no doubt about the

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:48.250
authority of consciousness to
think what it thinks.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:52.354
It may not clearly think about
things, about objects,

00:25:52.354 --> 00:25:57.327
but it has a kind of legitimate
basis that generates the sort of

00:25:57.327 --> 00:25:59.380
thinking that it does.
 

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.221
But then--and here is where I
want you to look at the passages

00:26:03.221 --> 00:26:04.670
that I've handed out.
 

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:08.471
Here's where three great
figures--there are others but

00:26:08.471 --> 00:26:11.630
these are considered the seminal
figures--

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:15.516
begin to raise questions which
complicate the whole issue of

00:26:15.516 --> 00:26:16.568
consciousness.
 

00:26:16.568 --> 00:26:21.444
Their argument is that it's not
just that consciousness doesn't

00:26:21.444 --> 00:26:25.769
clearly understand what it's
looking at and is therefore

00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:27.500
alienated from it.
 

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:31.141
It's also that consciousness is
alienated from its own

00:26:31.141 --> 00:26:34.388
underpinnings,
that it doesn't have any clear

00:26:34.388 --> 00:26:38.684
sense of where it's coming from
any more than what it's looking

00:26:38.684 --> 00:26:42.488
at: in other words,
that consciousness is not only

00:26:42.488 --> 00:26:46.536
estranged from the world but
that it is in and of itself

00:26:46.536 --> 00:26:47.640
inauthentic.
 

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.578
So just quickly look at these
passages.

00:26:50.578 --> 00:26:54.750
Marx, in the famous argument
about commodity fetishism in

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:58.772
Kapital, is
comparing the way in which we

00:26:58.772 --> 00:27:03.391
take the product of human labor
and turn it into a commodity by

00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:06.519
saying that it has objective
value,

00:27:06.519 --> 00:27:10.019
by saying that we know what its
value is in and of itself.

00:27:10.019 --> 00:27:12.670
He compares that with religion.
 

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:16.326
The argument is:
well, God is a product of human

00:27:16.326 --> 00:27:16.950
labor.
 

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.803
In other words,
it's not a completely

00:27:18.803 --> 00:27:21.833
supercilious argument,
sort of "God is brought

00:27:21.833 --> 00:27:25.693
into being the same way objects
that we make use of are brought

00:27:25.693 --> 00:27:26.940
into being."
 

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.785
God is a product of human
labor, but then we turn around

00:27:30.785 --> 00:27:34.141
and we say God exists
independently and has value

00:27:34.141 --> 00:27:35.259
objectively.
 

00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:39.588
Marx's argument is that the two
forms of belief,

00:27:39.588 --> 00:27:45.022
belief in the objective value
of the commodity and belief in

00:27:45.022 --> 00:27:47.048
God, are the same.
 

00:27:47.048 --> 00:27:50.773
Now whether or not any of this
is true, believe me,

00:27:50.773 --> 00:27:52.858
is neither here nor there.
 

00:27:52.858 --> 00:27:59.598
The point that Marx is making
is that consciousness,

00:27:59.598 --> 00:28:02.538
that is to say the way in which
we believe things,

00:28:02.538 --> 00:28:07.278
is determined by factors
outside its control--

00:28:07.278 --> 00:28:10.828
that is to say in the case of
Marx's arguments,

00:28:10.828 --> 00:28:15.817
social, historical and economic
factors that determine what we

00:28:15.817 --> 00:28:20.558
think and which in general we
call "ideology";

00:28:20.558 --> 00:28:25.294
that is to say,
ideology is driven by factors

00:28:25.294 --> 00:28:31.318
beyond the ken of the person who
thinks ideologically.

00:28:31.318 --> 00:28:34.547
So you see the problem for
consciousness now is not just a

00:28:34.547 --> 00:28:35.509
single problem.
 

00:28:35.509 --> 00:28:38.690
It's twofold:
its inauthentic relationship

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:42.645
with the things it looks at and
also its inauthentic

00:28:42.645 --> 00:28:46.058
relationship with its own
underpinnings.

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.703
The argument is exactly the
same for Nietzsche,

00:28:48.703 --> 00:28:50.890
only he shifts the ground of
attack.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:53.409
For Nietzsche,
the underpinnings of

00:28:53.409 --> 00:28:57.483
consciousness which make the
operations of consciousness

00:28:57.483 --> 00:29:01.190
inauthentic are the nature of
language itself.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:05.284
That is to say that when we
think we're telling the truth

00:29:05.284 --> 00:29:08.940
we're actually using worn-out
figures of speech.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.150
"What then is truth?
 

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:15.000
A mobile army of metaphors,
metonymies,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.209
anthropomorphisms--in short,
a sum of human relations which

00:29:19.209 --> 00:29:22.982
became poetically and
rhetorically intensified,"

00:29:22.982 --> 00:29:26.394
etc., etc., etc.,
"and are now no longer of

00:29:26.394 --> 00:29:29.660
account as coins but are
debased."

00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:31.079
Now that word "now"
&gt;

00:29:31.079 --> 00:29:32.380
is very important.
 

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.978
It suggests that Nietzsche does
somehow believe that there's a

00:29:35.978 --> 00:29:39.280
privileged moment in the history
of language when perhaps

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:42.941
language is a truth serum,
when it is capable of telling

00:29:42.941 --> 00:29:45.611
the truth,
but language has now

00:29:45.611 --> 00:29:48.940
simply become a question of
worn-out figures,

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:53.930
all of which dictates what we
believe to be true.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:59.686
I speak in a figurative way
about the relationship between

00:29:59.686 --> 00:30:04.737
the earth and the sky,
and I believe that there's a

00:30:04.737 --> 00:30:05.950
sky god.
 

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:09.366
I move from speech to belief
because I simply don't believe

00:30:09.366 --> 00:30:11.430
that I'm using figures of
speech.

00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:14.490
All of this is implied in
Nietzsche's argument.

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:16.472
In other words,
language, the nature of

00:30:16.472 --> 00:30:19.095
language,
and the way language is

00:30:19.095 --> 00:30:23.010
received by us,
in turn determines what we can

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.763
do with it,
which is to say it determines

00:30:25.763 --> 00:30:29.608
what we think,
so that for Nietzsche the

00:30:29.608 --> 00:30:33.965
distortion of truth--
that is to say the distortion

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:36.630
of the power to observe in
consciousness--

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:40.058
has as its underlying cause
language,

00:30:40.058 --> 00:30:43.500
the state of language,
the status of language.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:47.814
Freud finally argues for
exactly the same relationship

00:30:47.814 --> 00:30:50.801
between consciousness--
that is to say,

00:30:50.801 --> 00:30:54.038
what I think I am thinking from
minute to minute--

00:30:54.038 --> 00:30:58.028
and the unconscious,
which perpetually in one way or

00:30:58.028 --> 00:31:02.484
another unsettles what I'm
thinking and saying from minute

00:31:02.484 --> 00:31:03.578
to minute.
 

00:31:03.578 --> 00:31:05.982
You know that in The
Psychopathology of Everyday

00:31:05.982 --> 00:31:08.028
Life,
Freud reminded us that the

00:31:08.028 --> 00:31:11.420
Freudian slip isn't something
that happens just sometimes--

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.895
and nobody knows this better
than an ad libbing lecturer--

00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:17.578
;it's something that happens all
the time.

00:31:17.578 --> 00:31:22.713
The Freudian slip is something
that one lives with simply as a

00:31:22.713 --> 00:31:27.092
phenomenon of the slippage of
consciousness under the

00:31:27.092 --> 00:31:29.868
influence of the unconscious.
 

00:31:29.868 --> 00:31:33.036
Now in the passage I gave you,
Freud says a very interesting

00:31:33.036 --> 00:31:35.137
thing,
which is that after all,

00:31:35.137 --> 00:31:39.184
we have absolutely no objective
evidence that the unconscious

00:31:39.184 --> 00:31:39.858
exists.
 

00:31:39.858 --> 00:31:44.230
If I could see the unconscious,
it'd be conscious.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.900
Right.
 

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.335
The unconscious,
Freud is saying,

00:31:47.335 --> 00:31:51.900
is something that we have to
infer from the way consciousness

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:52.890
operates.
 

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:54.460
We've got to infer something.
 

00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.778
We've got to figure out somehow
how it is that consciousness is

00:31:58.778 --> 00:32:02.887
never completely uninhibited,
never completely does and says

00:32:02.887 --> 00:32:04.630
what it wants to say.
 

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:10.328
So the spin on consciousness
for Freud is the unconscious.

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:14.519
Now someone who didn't fully
believe Marx,

00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:17.387
Nietzsche and Freud,
a very important modern

00:32:17.387 --> 00:32:21.588
philosopher in the hermeneutic
tradition named Paul Ricoeur,

00:32:21.588 --> 00:32:26.096
famously said in the fourth
passage on your sheet that these

00:32:26.096 --> 00:32:29.000
great precursors of modern
thought--

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.848
and particularly,
I would immediately add,

00:32:31.848 --> 00:32:36.691
of modern literary
theory--together dominate a

00:32:36.691 --> 00:32:40.348
"school of suspicion."
 

00:32:40.348 --> 00:32:44.523
There is in other words in
Ricoeur's view a hermeneutics of

00:32:44.523 --> 00:32:47.448
suspicion,
and "skepticism"

00:32:47.448 --> 00:32:51.271
or "suspicion"
is a word that can also be

00:32:51.271 --> 00:32:55.326
appropriated perhaps more
rigorously for philosophy as

00:32:55.326 --> 00:32:56.548
negativity.
 

00:32:56.548 --> 00:33:00.055
That is to say,
whatever seems manifest or

00:33:00.055 --> 00:33:05.184
obvious or patent in what we are
looking at is undermined for

00:33:05.184 --> 00:33:10.057
this kind of mind by a negation
which is counterintuitive:

00:33:10.057 --> 00:33:14.258
that is to say,
which would seem not just to

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:18.894
qualify what we understand
ourselves to be looking at but

00:33:18.894 --> 00:33:21.380
to undermine it altogether.
 

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.721
And these tendencies in the way
in which Marx,

00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:26.846
Nietzsche and Freud have been
received have been tremendously

00:33:26.846 --> 00:33:27.680
influential.
 

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.701
When we read Foucault's
"What is an

00:33:29.701 --> 00:33:32.913
Author?" next time
we'll return to this question of

00:33:32.913 --> 00:33:35.327
how Marx,
Nietzsche and Freud have been

00:33:35.327 --> 00:33:38.875
received and what we should make
of that in view of Foucault's

00:33:38.875 --> 00:33:41.935
idea that--
well, not that there's no such

00:33:41.935 --> 00:33:46.727
thing as an author but that it's
rather dangerous to believe that

00:33:46.727 --> 00:33:48.298
there are authors.
 

00:33:48.298 --> 00:33:49.500
So if it's dangerous to believe
that there are authors,

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.368
what about Marx,
Nietzsche and Freud?

00:33:50.368 --> 00:33:53.342
Foucault confronts this
question in "What is an

00:33:53.342 --> 00:33:56.838
Author?" and gives
us some interesting results of

00:33:56.838 --> 00:33:57.828
his thinking.
 

00:33:57.828 --> 00:34:04.868
For us, the aftermath even
precisely of the passages I have

00:34:04.868 --> 00:34:09.077
just quoted,
but certainly of the oeuvre

00:34:09.077 --> 00:34:12.739
of the three authors I have
quoted from,

00:34:12.739 --> 00:34:18.726
can to a large degree be
understood as accounting for our

00:34:18.726 --> 00:34:21.478
topic--
the phenomenon of literary

00:34:21.478 --> 00:34:23.059
theory as we study it.
 

00:34:23.059 --> 00:34:24.728
In other words,
literary theory,

00:34:24.728 --> 00:34:27.150
because of the influence of
these figures,

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:33.286
is to a considerable degree a
hermeneutics of suspicion

00:34:33.286 --> 00:34:39.880
recognized as such both by its
proponents and famously--

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:43.449
I think this is perhaps what is
historically remote for you--

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:45.179
by its enemies.
 

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:48.039
During the same period when I
was first teaching this course,

00:34:48.039 --> 00:34:53.202
a veritable six-foot shelf of
diatribes against literary

00:34:53.202 --> 00:34:57.710
theory was being written in the
public sphere.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:35:02.349
You can take or leave literary
theory,

00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:06.135
fine, but the idea that there
would be such an incredible

00:35:06.135 --> 00:35:10.599
outcry against it was one of the
most fascinating results of it.

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:14.054
That is to say for many,
many, many people literary

00:35:14.054 --> 00:35:18.199
theory had something to do with
the end of civilization as we

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:19.030
know it.
 

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:24.434
That's one of the things that
seems rather strange to us today

00:35:24.434 --> 00:35:29.219
from an historical perspective:
that the undermining of

00:35:29.219 --> 00:35:34.447
foundational knowledge which
seemed to be part and parcel of

00:35:34.447 --> 00:35:39.940
so much that went on in literary
theory was seen as the central

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:45.168
crucial threat to rationality
emanating from the academy and

00:35:45.168 --> 00:35:51.927
was attacked in those terms in,
as I say, at least six feet of

00:35:51.927 --> 00:35:53.650
lively polemics.
 

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:57.650
All of that is the legacy of
literary theory,

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.248
and as I say,
it arises in part from the

00:36:01.248 --> 00:36:06.416
element of skepticism that I
thought it best to emphasize

00:36:06.416 --> 00:36:07.340
today.
 

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:12.730
Now I think that one thing
Ricoeur leaves out,

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:16.675
and something that we can
anticipate as becoming more and

00:36:16.675 --> 00:36:20.833
more important for literary
theory and other kinds of theory

00:36:20.833 --> 00:36:24.780
in the twenty-first century,
is Darwin.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.784
That is to say,
it strikes me that Darwin could

00:36:28.784 --> 00:36:34.010
very easily be considered a
fourth hermeneut of suspicion.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.974
Of course, Darwin was not
interested in suspicion but he

00:36:37.974 --> 00:36:41.577
was certainly the founder of
ways of thinking about

00:36:41.577 --> 00:36:44.389
consciousness that are
determined,

00:36:44.389 --> 00:36:48.411
socio-biologically determined:
determined in the realm of

00:36:48.411 --> 00:36:51.335
cognitive science,
determined as artificial

00:36:51.335 --> 00:36:53.630
intelligence,
and so on.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.362
All of this is Darwinian
thinking and,

00:36:56.362 --> 00:37:00.572
I think, increasingly will be
central in importance in the

00:37:00.572 --> 00:37:02.420
twenty-first century.
 

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:08.284
What will alter the shape of
literary theory as it was known

00:37:08.284 --> 00:37:12.559
and studied in the twentieth
century is,

00:37:12.559 --> 00:37:16.472
I think, an increasing emphasis
on cognitive science and

00:37:16.472 --> 00:37:20.172
socio-biological approaches both
to literature and to

00:37:20.172 --> 00:37:24.583
interpretive processes that will
derive from Darwin in the same

00:37:24.583 --> 00:37:28.780
way that strands of thinking of
the twentieth century derive

00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.409
from the three figures that I've
mentioned.

00:37:32.409 --> 00:37:37.023
But what all this gives rise
to--and this brings me finally

00:37:37.023 --> 00:37:41.876
to the passages which you have
on both sides of your sheet and

00:37:41.876 --> 00:37:46.730
which I don't want to take up
today but just to preview--

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.159
the passages from Henry James'
Ambassadors from 1903,

00:37:50.159 --> 00:37:53.202
and from Chekhov's The
Cherry Orchard from

00:37:53.202 --> 00:37:53.860
1904.
 

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.800
In other words,
I am at pains to remind you

00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:00.579
that this is a specific
historical moment in which,

00:38:00.579 --> 00:38:04.487
in a variety of ways,
in each case the speaker argues

00:38:04.487 --> 00:38:07.217
that consciousness--
that is to say,

00:38:07.217 --> 00:38:11.311
the feeling of being alive and
being someone acting in the

00:38:11.311 --> 00:38:14.840
world--
no longer involves agency:

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:21.110
the feeling that somehow to be
conscious has become to be a

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:25.994
puppet,
that there is a limitation on

00:38:25.994 --> 00:38:30.322
what we can do,
imposed by the idea that

00:38:30.322 --> 00:38:35.817
consciousness is determined in
ways that we cannot control and

00:38:35.817 --> 00:38:40.472
cannot get the better of,
so that Strether in The

00:38:40.472 --> 00:38:45.422
Ambassadors and Yepihodov in
The Cherry Orchard speak

00:38:45.422 --> 00:38:50.215
for a point of view which is a
kind of partially well-informed

00:38:50.215 --> 00:38:54.773
gloom and doom that could be
understood to anticipate texts

00:38:54.773 --> 00:39:00.273
that are much better informed,
that we will be considering but

00:39:00.273 --> 00:39:04.976
nevertheless are especially
important as an aspect of their

00:39:04.976 --> 00:39:06.679
historical moment.
 

00:39:06.679 --> 00:39:09.965
I want to begin the next
lecture by taking up those

00:39:09.965 --> 00:39:10.690
passages.
 

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.885
Please do bring them,
and I will also be passing

00:39:13.885 --> 00:39:17.762
around Tony the Tow Truck
and I'll give you a brief

00:39:17.762 --> 00:39:21.842
description of what the little
children's book actually looks

00:39:21.842 --> 00:39:24.025
like,
and then we will plunge in to

00:39:24.025 --> 00:39:26.099
the question "What is an
author?"

00:39:26.099 --> 00:39:27.510
So I'll see you on Thursday.

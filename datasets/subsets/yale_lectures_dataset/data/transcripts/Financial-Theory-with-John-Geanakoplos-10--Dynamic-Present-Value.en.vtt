00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:08.870
So this class and the next
class and a half are going to be

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.850
about Fisher's theory of present
value and the interest rate,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.460
and then we're going to move to
uncertainty.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.588
So up until now what we've done
is we found out first,

00:00:24.588 --> 00:00:27.775
if you know the whole economic
system, how to solve for

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:28.720
equilibrium.
 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.570
To figure out from the
primitives of people's tastes,

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.701
their impatience,
the technology,

00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:36.393
the economy,
how to figure out the real rate

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:39.834
of interest if provided there is
no uncertainty in the world and

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:42.730
people can forecast what is
going to happen later.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.270
We've found that once you've
done that,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.947
the price of every asset,
if people are rational and

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:51.403
looking forward to the future,
the price of every asset is

00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:55.105
going to be the present value of
the future payments of the

00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:55.680
asset.
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.172
So if you think of the payments
as real payments,

00:00:58.172 --> 00:01:01.234
which is what Fisher always
recommended, you discount by the

00:01:01.234 --> 00:01:02.429
real interest rate.
 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.346
If you think of them as cash
payments then you discount by

00:01:05.346 --> 00:01:06.780
the nominal interest rate.
 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.376
So every asset corresponds to
its present value of its

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:16.409
dividends either discounted by
the real rate or the nominal

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.188
rate.
 

00:01:17.188 --> 00:01:23.188
Now, this thinking is
surprisingly powerful and leads

00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:26.879
you to unexpected conclusions.
 

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:29.438
So the next two classes is
about that.

00:01:29.438 --> 00:01:32.150
Mostly I'm going to talk about
Social Security,

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.510
but I'm going to begin today by
finishing off a subject we

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.810
didn't quite get through last
time.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.007
So you see, if you realize that
the price of every asset is just

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:44.540
the present value of its
dividends,

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.391
and you also suppose you know
what the dividends are going to

00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:50.099
be and what the future interest
rates are going to be,

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:53.471
then it follows that you know
what the price of the asset is

00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:55.063
going to be,
not just today,

00:01:55.063 --> 00:01:57.265
but next year,
and the year after and the year

00:01:57.265 --> 00:01:57.950
after that.
 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.400
So your theory of asset pricing
today,

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.837
which was based on the
assumption that you can forecast

00:02:02.837 --> 00:02:05.221
the future,
necessarily implies the theory

00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:07.090
of asset pricing in the future.
 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.397
So you can tell something about
how asset prices are going to

00:02:10.397 --> 00:02:12.437
change,
and of course you can also test

00:02:12.437 --> 00:02:15.031
the theory because the theory
implicitly is forecasting

00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:19.125
something about the future,
and therefore you can test the

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:19.818
theory.
 

00:02:19.818 --> 00:02:25.310
So let's just take a couple
examples that are in the notes.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.520
So we said at the top,
if you can read it,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.407
I hope it's not too small--I
want to move a little quickly so

00:02:31.407 --> 00:02:34.000
I could be writing this on the
board,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.020
but if you can see it and you
look at the top line it says

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:50.324
that the present value of the
assets is just the discount of

00:02:50.324 --> 00:02:53.280
future dividends.
 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.298
So maybe I'll start one line
up, actually,

00:02:58.298 --> 00:03:00.378
in these notes.
 

00:03:00.378 --> 00:03:02.701
So if you look in the middle
here the present value today,

00:03:02.701 --> 00:03:05.025
suppose you have an asset,
maybe I'm going to write on the

00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:05.840
board after all.
 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.373
Present value of an asset,
suppose you know the dividends

00:03:09.373 --> 00:03:13.034
are going to be paying C (1),
C (2), and maybe C (T) at the

00:03:13.034 --> 00:03:13.538
end.
 

00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:16.532
Those are the dividends that
are going to be paid,

00:03:16.532 --> 00:03:19.770
and you can ask what the
present value of the asset is

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.908
today, PV_0 today,
0.

00:03:21.908 --> 00:03:26.117
Well, Fisher would say if you
think of these as nominal cash

00:03:26.117 --> 00:03:30.468
flows he would say what you need
to do is you need to find out

00:03:30.468 --> 00:03:32.110
the price of zeros.
 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.657
So you recall that Fisher said
that you could let

00:03:37.657 --> 00:03:44.360
pi_1 = the price today
of 1 dollar at time 1,

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.268
and the price today
pi_T = the price today

00:03:49.268 --> 00:03:51.288
of 1 dollar time T.
 

00:03:51.288 --> 00:03:55.470
It's the price today of 1
dollar in the future.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.365
These were the crucial prices
that Fisher said that you should

00:03:58.365 --> 00:03:59.220
always look for.
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.941
He said that you can always
find these prices,

00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:05.146
pi_1 through
pi_T by deriving them

00:04:05.146 --> 00:04:06.658
from the yield curve.
 

00:04:06.658 --> 00:04:10.471
So every morning everybody
looks at the yield curve,

00:04:10.471 --> 00:04:14.133
all financial analysts,
they look at the prices of

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.449
bonds traded in the market.
 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.629
The simplest form is you get a
yield curve in the newspapers.

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:22.074
You deduce from the yield curve
what these present values

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:24.153
pi_1,
pi_T are,

00:04:24.153 --> 00:04:28.108
and that allows you to price
any asset like this one simply

00:04:28.108 --> 00:04:30.629
by multiplying by
pi_1,

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:35.949
pi_2 and at the end
by pi_T.

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.230
So that's step 1.
 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.028
But then step 2,
we said, was that once you've

00:04:41.028 --> 00:04:44.199
got these prices you can figure
out the forwards.

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:54.259
So the forwards are going to be
1 i_t,

00:04:54.259 --> 00:05:06.675
so 1 i_t that's by
definition the interest from t

00:05:06.675 --> 00:05:14.810
to t 1 that would be agreed
today.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.653
It's not the interest rate
that's going to prevail from

00:05:17.653 --> 00:05:19.997
time t,
it's the interest rate that

00:05:19.997 --> 00:05:23.971
people today at time 0 would
agree to pay between time t and

00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:24.778
time t 1.
 

00:05:24.778 --> 00:05:27.461
So that, of course,
has to just equal

00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:30.439
pi_t over pi_t
1,

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.254
because everybody today
recognizes that the cost of a

00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:36.589
dollar time t is pi_t,
and the cost of a dollar at

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:38.190
time t 1 is pi_t 1.
 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.644
So the tradeoff between t and t
1 that's effectively what an

00:05:41.644 --> 00:05:44.923
interest rate does is it trades
off money at one time for

00:05:44.923 --> 00:05:45.920
another time.
 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.220
It has to be this ratio.
 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.144
So today people would agree on
1 i_t^(F),

00:05:50.144 --> 00:05:51.959
forward, as the forward rate.
 

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:59.201
Now, you add to that the
assumption that everybody is

00:05:59.201 --> 00:06:06.860
certain about the future,
assume perfect forecasting.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.728
So I don't have to actually
assume people are right in their

00:06:09.728 --> 00:06:10.410
forecasting.
 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.720
I have to assume that they are
completely sure of their

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.319
forecasting.
 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:16.773
So if they're completely sure
of their forecasting then

00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:20.545
everybody must foresee that they
think they're sure that the

00:06:20.545 --> 00:06:24.447
future interest rate that will
prevail at time t is also equal

00:06:24.447 --> 00:06:25.790
to this number.
 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:34.230
So we can then rewrite this
price.

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.110
Hello.
 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.985
We can rewrite this price as 1
i_0^(F),

00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:44.336
forward;
instead of pi_2,

00:06:44.336 --> 00:06:49.411
pi_2 is just going to
be 1 over (1 i_0^(F))

00:06:49.411 --> 00:06:55.016
times (1 i_1^(F)),
and time pi_T is just

00:06:55.016 --> 00:06:59.641
going to be 1 over (1
i_0^(F)) times (1

00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:02.050
i_1^(F)) ...
 

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:10.990
times (1 i_t 1^(F)).
 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:17.634
Because using the fact that (1
i_t) is pi_t

00:07:17.634 --> 00:07:23.742
divided by pi_t 1 I
just multiply pi_1

00:07:23.742 --> 00:07:29.744
divided by pi_2 times
pi_2 divided by

00:07:29.744 --> 00:07:32.959
pi_0 etcetera.
 

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:37.776
If I take pi_1
divided by pi_0 times

00:07:37.776 --> 00:07:42.069
etcetera I'm going to get
exactly this formula.

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:52.410
So pi_0 is always 1,
by the way.

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:54.880
So if I want to take
pi_1 it's just going

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.709
to be 1 over (1
i_0^(F)).

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:02.127
If I want to take
pi_2 I can always do

00:08:02.127 --> 00:08:03.755
this,
pi_2,

00:08:03.755 --> 00:08:05.970
and so this is going to equal
pi_2,

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:09.574
so pi_2 is going to
be 1 over (1 i^(F)_0)

00:08:09.574 --> 00:08:12.338
times 1 over (1
i^(F)_1) etcetera.

00:08:12.338 --> 00:08:14.319
And pi_3,
if I want to do pi_3,

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:16.690
I just multiply by
pi_3 over

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.639
pi_2 and so that's
equal to 1 over (1

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:23.485
i^(F)_0) times 1 over
(1 i^(F)_1) times 1

00:08:23.485 --> 00:08:25.600
over (1 i^(F)_2).
 

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.389
So instead of multiplying by
the pis I may as well take the

00:08:28.389 --> 00:08:29.639
product of the forwards.
 

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:31.100
It's exactly the same thing.
 

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.889
So the present value has this
simple formula,

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:39.341
but this is a formula that
holds at every time t if you're

00:08:39.341 --> 00:08:42.794
totally confident of your
predictions of the Cs and of the

00:08:42.794 --> 00:08:44.370
future interest rates.
 

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:49.570
This is where we ended last
time, basically with this

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:50.570
formula.
 

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.495
The key that you had to use in
the problem set was to realize

00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:56.519
if you're totally confident now
about the future you have to be

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:59.690
totally confident about doing
this calculation in the future.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:03.423
So PV_1 is going to
be basically the same

00:09:03.423 --> 00:09:04.470
calculation.
 

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.019
So what's going to happen at
time 1?

00:09:07.019 --> 00:09:10.505
After you've gone down 1 year
you've finished with this

00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:14.509
interest rate and you're looking
at everything 1 year later.

00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:20.495
So I may as well write the
PV_1 here and that's

00:09:20.495 --> 00:09:25.208
going to equal C (2)--
let's put it a little bit

00:09:25.208 --> 00:09:30.024
lower--PV_1 is going
to equal the same C (2) as

00:09:30.024 --> 00:09:32.389
before,
but now a year later.

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:37.830
So it's just going to be 1
i^(F)_1 C (T),

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:43.379
and I don't need the 1
i^(F)_0 anymore.

00:09:43.379 --> 00:09:48.589
(1 i^(F)_1) times ...
 

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:52.788
(1 i^(F)_T-1).
 

00:09:52.788 --> 00:09:55.384
So it's exactly the same
formula 1 year later,

00:09:55.384 --> 00:09:58.960
and 1 year later you no longer
have to worry about the interest

00:09:58.960 --> 00:09:59.480
rate.
 

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.158
That time already passed.
 

00:10:01.158 --> 00:10:04.410
So you just drop this at every
time and you write the same

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:07.548
formula, and of course you drop
C (1) because that's all

00:10:07.548 --> 00:10:08.288
finished.
 

00:10:08.288 --> 00:10:13.499
So the price at time 1 is just
what's left except you've

00:10:13.499 --> 00:10:18.139
chopped off the 1
i^(F)_0 everywhere.

00:10:18.139 --> 00:10:25.374
So to write that the same way,
so PV_0 (I can write

00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:30.678
it the same way) =,
PV_0 = what?

00:10:30.678 --> 00:10:33.658
It's going to equal the
interest payment you get,

00:10:33.658 --> 00:10:35.649
C (1), not the interest,
the dividend you get,

00:10:35.649 --> 00:10:46.982
the cash flow you get plus
PV_1 divided by 1

00:10:46.982 --> 00:10:51.259
i^(F)_0.
 

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:53.440
So this is a very important
formula.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.129
So why is that?
 

00:10:56.129 --> 00:11:01.597
Well, it's a proof by formula,
but another way of saying it is

00:11:01.597 --> 00:11:05.490
that PV_0,
when you get the asset at time

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:07.870
0 it gives you a cash flow at
time 1,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.498
and then of course looked at
from the point of view of time 1

00:11:10.498 --> 00:11:12.250
you've got all the future cash
flows,

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.080
but that's just what
PV_1 is.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:18.211
So basically the bond is going
to give you a cash flow at time

00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:19.924
1,
and then the right to cash

00:11:19.924 --> 00:11:22.606
flows in the future,
but this right to cash flows in

00:11:22.606 --> 00:11:24.860
the future at time 1 is worth
PV_1.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.009
So it's like you've got all
this money at time 1 and so to

00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:31.379
get the value at time 0 you have
to discount it back again.

00:11:31.379 --> 00:11:38.283
So this is a very famous and
important formula which I want

00:11:38.283 --> 00:11:42.570
to pause a second and think
about.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:56.720
So there's a controversy today
called marking to market.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.870
Does anybody know what that
controversy is about?

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.029
What does marking to market
mean?

00:12:02.029 --> 00:12:03.509
Yep?
 

00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:07.053
Student: I believe that
it means that corporations and

00:12:07.053 --> 00:12:10.184
their accounting rules are
currently required to value

00:12:10.184 --> 00:12:13.907
their assets at what they would
fetch in the market if they were

00:12:13.907 --> 00:12:15.028
to sell them.
 

00:12:15.028 --> 00:12:19.844
Prof: Right,
but you know that they've been

00:12:19.844 --> 00:12:24.070
relieved of this responsibility
recently.

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:24.908
Student: No,
I didn't know that.

00:12:24.908 --> 00:12:26.812
Prof: Well,
so they've been relieved of

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:28.038
this responsibility lately.
 

00:12:28.038 --> 00:12:29.830
Now, why have they been
relieved of it?

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.182
Because the thought was that
the market was so panicked in

00:12:33.182 --> 00:12:36.535
the crisis that the price that
they could fetch by selling

00:12:36.535 --> 00:12:39.889
their things really had nothing
to do with the value.

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:43.732
So we're going to come back to
whether that was a good idea

00:12:43.732 --> 00:12:46.980
that Congress passed under
tremendous pressure.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.360
What is the point of marking to
market?

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.770
So let's suppose that you
really could anticipate the

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.720
future and everybody was right
about it.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.928
The market price then would
really be PV_0 today,

00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:01.340
and it really would be
PV_1 tomorrow,

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.988
because if the interest rate's
do actually turn out to be what

00:13:03.988 --> 00:13:06.110
everybody expects,
and everybody's completely

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.254
confident of their expectation,
then as we saw the prices would

00:13:09.254 --> 00:13:11.428
have to be this today and this
tomorrow,

00:13:11.428 --> 00:13:12.538
otherwise there'd be an
arbitrage.

00:13:12.538 --> 00:13:15.009
You could make money for sure,
or think you could make money

00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:15.470
for sure.
 

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.721
So if you're marking to market
what are you going to mark as

00:13:19.721 --> 00:13:20.730
the profits?
 

00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:28.259
Are you going to say the profit
at time 1 is--so what is profit?

00:13:28.259 --> 00:13:30.159
If I had some room I'd put this
somewhere.

00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:35.620
How would you define profit?
 

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:36.590
I'll get rid of this.
 

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.870
I think we've got this straight.
 

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:52.870
 
 

00:13:52.870 --> 00:14:00.080
So how would you define profit
at time 1?

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:07.690
What would you write?
 

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.269
So let's say that this isn't a
bond.

00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:11.230
It's an investment.
 

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.903
You paid a bunch of money at
time 0, maybe PV_0 and

00:14:14.903 --> 00:14:18.759
in the future your investment is
going to pay off some money.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:20.460
Maybe it was a project you
invested in.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.168
Maybe you bought a bunch of
stuff and you're selling it in

00:14:23.168 --> 00:14:24.879
the future and getting this
money.

00:14:24.879 --> 00:14:27.288
Maybe you bought a bond which
is paying these coupons.

00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:29.918
Whatever it is these are the
cash flows of the project,

00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:32.450
and now of course your
investors are very curious.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:35.192
In year 1, they want to know
what profit have you made,

00:14:35.192 --> 00:14:36.210
how are you doing?
 

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.629
So what's a number that you'd
think of giving?

00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:40.500
What's the first number you'd
think of telling them?

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.259
Yep?
 

00:14:41.259 --> 00:14:43.340
Student: Maybe the first
cash flow payout.

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:50.289
Prof: So you might think
of saying, C (1).

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:51.830
That's the cash you've gotten.
 

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.860
So all these people could see
you've gotten C (1).

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.004
That's your revenue,
and I'm assuming this cash flow

00:14:58.004 --> 00:14:59.298
is net of expenses.
 

00:14:59.298 --> 00:15:02.600
So you could say here's your
revenue you got at time 1,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.090
C (1).
 

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.759
Is that your profit?
 

00:15:04.759 --> 00:15:07.149
If it were, people would then
look and they'd say,

00:15:07.149 --> 00:15:11.875
"Well, we got profit of C
(1) and we put an investment in

00:15:11.875 --> 00:15:15.750
of PV_0 so is that the
rate of return?

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:24.639
Is that my rate of return?"
 

00:15:24.639 --> 00:15:25.860
Yeah?
 

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.720
Student: Can we do
PV_1 - PV_0

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:29.639
and add it here?
 

00:15:29.639 --> 00:15:33.840
Prof: So he's exactly
right.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.515
I'm going to repeat what he
said, but I'm going to take

00:15:37.515 --> 00:15:38.808
longer to say it.
 

00:15:38.808 --> 00:15:43.511
This idea of writing C (1) over
PV_0 is actually what

00:15:43.511 --> 00:15:48.062
many people try to say is their
profit, but it's a bad number

00:15:48.062 --> 00:15:49.200
for profit.
 

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.058
Now, if in period 1 you stopped
marking to market,

00:15:53.058 --> 00:15:55.759
and you had no idea,
you didn't have to report this

00:15:55.759 --> 00:15:58.287
number PV_1,
I mean, you didn't know what it

00:15:58.287 --> 00:15:59.730
was or you didn't have to report
it,

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:03.572
what else could you report but
C (1) over PV_0 as the

00:16:03.572 --> 00:16:04.129
profit?
 

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:06.735
So marking to market,
you see, is intimately

00:16:06.735 --> 00:16:08.980
connected to how you report
profit.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:10.975
So if you don't mark to market
you don't know,

00:16:10.975 --> 00:16:13.722
you don't have to declare what
the value of the assets are that

00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:14.298
are left.
 

00:16:14.298 --> 00:16:17.307
All you would do when you
describe your profits is you'd

00:16:17.307 --> 00:16:19.836
say C (1) and people would,
of course, in their heads,

00:16:19.836 --> 00:16:21.370
in fact they wouldn't do it in
their heads,

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:24.571
you'd tell them,
"Our rate of return was C

00:16:24.571 --> 00:16:28.607
(1) over PV_0,"
but why might that be a very

00:16:28.607 --> 00:16:30.139
misleading number?
 

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:34.803
Well, his point is it could
well be that C (1) is a very

00:16:34.803 --> 00:16:35.990
high number.
 

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.398
You've got a lot of cash flow
this period, but he said it may

00:16:40.398 --> 00:16:44.220
turn out that PV_1 is
a terrible number.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:47.669
You may have gotten a lot of
cash flow, but there's nothing

00:16:47.669 --> 00:16:48.918
left going forward.
 

00:16:48.918 --> 00:16:53.548
So he doesn't think that's a
very good measure of profit.

00:16:53.548 --> 00:17:02.107
So he's suggesting why not
report profit as C (1)

00:17:02.107 --> 00:17:08.170
PV_1 - PV_0.
 

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:11.710
Now, suppose you did that?
 

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:13.814
So he's saying,
look, you've got a certain

00:17:13.814 --> 00:17:16.894
amount of cash but the assets
that you had also changed value

00:17:16.894 --> 00:17:19.410
and you ought to include that in
your profit.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:21.430
So what if you did that?
 

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:25.269
What would your rate of return
be?

00:17:25.269 --> 00:17:28.423
And suppose PV_0 and
PV_1 were calculated

00:17:28.423 --> 00:17:28.950
as this?
 

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:31.496
And so you divided this by
PV_0 what would that

00:17:31.496 --> 00:17:31.859
equal?
 

00:17:31.859 --> 00:17:52.068
 
 

00:17:52.068 --> 00:17:58.420
What number would I get if I
did that?

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.130
I can't hear.
 

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:00.890
What?
 

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:03.190
Somebody speak up.
 

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:05.640
Student:
i^(F)_0.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.960
Prof: Yes.
 

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.798
This would just be
i^(F)_0,

00:18:09.798 --> 00:18:14.690
and you get the rate of return
that you're expecting to get.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.710
Now, how do I know that's
i^(F)_0?

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.896
Because I multiplied by
PV_0 to this side,

00:18:19.896 --> 00:18:22.646
then I moved that
PV_0 to the other

00:18:22.646 --> 00:18:23.210
side.
 

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.146
That gives me 1
i_0^(F)

00:18:26.146 --> 00:18:29.272
PV_0,
then I divide by that 1

00:18:29.272 --> 00:18:31.900
i^(F)_0 and put it
down here,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.960
and that's this formula.
 

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:37.910
So that is what you would get,
i^(F)_0.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:40.156
And you see that's what you
should expect to get because you

00:18:40.156 --> 00:18:41.299
haven't done anything great.
 

00:18:41.299 --> 00:18:42.440
You've got a cash flow.
 

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.098
You've got these cash flows at
the beginning.

00:18:45.098 --> 00:18:48.143
You paid a fair price for them
and next period everybody

00:18:48.143 --> 00:18:51.630
forecast that the values were
going to go to PV_1,

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.559
and so it can't be that you're,
you know--

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:54.890
this was an investment you made.
 

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:55.779
You put your money in.
 

00:18:55.779 --> 00:18:57.240
You bought this bond.
 

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:00.893
You could sell the bond now at
time 1 after having obtained the

00:19:00.893 --> 00:19:01.660
cash flows.
 

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:04.753
It better be that your rate of
return is the market interest

00:19:04.753 --> 00:19:07.375
rate of return otherwise there'd
be some arbitrage,

00:19:07.375 --> 00:19:08.528
and in fact it is.
 

00:19:08.528 --> 00:19:12.126
So if you can compute all the
present values properly,

00:19:12.126 --> 00:19:16.200
the only fair thing to do--this
is not a great investment.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.486
Even if C (1) is a huge amount
of money it's only huge because

00:19:19.486 --> 00:19:21.750
PV_1 is a low amount
of money.

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:24.078
Because it has to be that the
profit every period,

00:19:24.078 --> 00:19:26.385
the rate of profit,
is exactly equal to the

00:19:26.385 --> 00:19:29.766
interest rate,
because everything is always

00:19:29.766 --> 00:19:32.298
priced at its present value.
 

00:19:32.298 --> 00:19:40.849
So it's a simple concept which
somehow takes a long time to

00:19:40.849 --> 00:19:42.029
grasp.
 

00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:46.198
It just seems to people
that--here's the money that's

00:19:46.198 --> 00:19:47.000
come in.
 

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.920
That's the cash you can count
in your hands.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.858
You've got it in your hands.
 

00:19:49.858 --> 00:19:52.236
That's the number you should
talk about as profit,

00:19:52.236 --> 00:19:55.000
but of course of the money
coming into your hands--there's

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.358
this other hidden thing.
 

00:19:56.358 --> 00:19:58.938
The stuff that you own has
suddenly fallen in value

00:19:58.938 --> 00:20:00.640
compared to what it was before.
 

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.365
You're really not putting the
firm in any better position than

00:20:03.365 --> 00:20:04.078
it was before.
 

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:07.000
You just earned your normal
rate of return.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.480
So you can see why,
to give a fair description of

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.951
how people are doing,
the law was written,

00:20:17.951 --> 00:20:21.397
evolved to the point where
people were forced not to just

00:20:21.397 --> 00:20:23.729
say C (1),
they were forced to

00:20:23.729 --> 00:20:27.305
declare--mark to market,
and add PV_1 -

00:20:27.305 --> 00:20:31.348
PV_0 to their profit
to get a real rate of return,

00:20:31.348 --> 00:20:37.240
to get a more revealing rate of
return.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:40.277
And so what happened in the
crisis is this PV_1

00:20:40.277 --> 00:20:43.205
became such a horribly low
number that if you plug that

00:20:43.205 --> 00:20:46.190
into this formula you get
PV_1 is a really low

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.359
number compared to
PV_0.

00:20:48.359 --> 00:20:49.769
You get a giant negative here.
 

00:20:49.769 --> 00:20:53.769
It would look like the rate of
return was terrible.

00:20:53.769 --> 00:20:56.930
Everyone would panic and think
the firms had fallen apart.

00:20:56.930 --> 00:21:00.506
So especially the banks were
the ones who didn't want to do

00:21:00.506 --> 00:21:02.926
this,
and so Congress didn't want the

00:21:02.926 --> 00:21:05.539
public to be panicked so it
simply said,

00:21:05.539 --> 00:21:07.000
"Okay, forget about it.
 

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.953
We're going to not hold you to
writing PV_1 anymore

00:21:09.953 --> 00:21:12.808
because we can't count anybody
figuring out what it is,

00:21:12.808 --> 00:21:15.298
and so you don't have to tell
us that.

00:21:15.298 --> 00:21:17.500
You just have to tell us
this," which happens to be

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.205
a good number for the banks,
but that doesn't mean the banks

00:21:20.205 --> 00:21:23.092
are actually doing well because
the assets they hold have been

00:21:23.092 --> 00:21:24.180
collapsing in value.
 

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:24.259
Yeah?
 

00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:26.775
Student: Does that
&gt;

00:21:26.775 --> 00:21:29.742
say that assuming there's no
arbitrage opportunity if a firm

00:21:29.742 --> 00:21:32.460
pays out a high dividend its
stock should go down?

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.509
Prof: Yes, right.
 

00:21:34.509 --> 00:21:36.930
That's exactly what it says and
that's what does happen.

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:39.910
So you always talk about the
price, ex-dividend and stuff

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:41.400
like that, precisely that.
 

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.019
So if a firm pays a bigger than
usual dividend,

00:21:44.019 --> 00:21:47.852
if it suddenly decides it's
going to pay itself a gigantic

00:21:47.852 --> 00:21:51.818
dividend then the price of the
firm is going to go down,

00:21:51.818 --> 00:21:55.808
exactly, because there's less
value in the firm.

00:21:55.808 --> 00:21:58.450
You've paid it out here instead
of keeping it into the firm.

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.909
So this is a very simple idea,
but it's very easy to get

00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:01.670
confused about.
 

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.779
Are there any questions about
it?

00:22:05.779 --> 00:22:08.140
So let's do an example of it.
 

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:14.088
The most basic example of it is
the premium bond.

00:22:14.088 --> 00:22:16.519
So we talked about this before,
the premium bond.

00:22:16.519 --> 00:22:21.650
So let's say you have
PV_0 = 5 divided by

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:26.061
1.10 5 divided by 1.10
[correction: squared]

00:22:26.061 --> 00:22:30.680
(maybe this was exactly the
problem set,

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.193
I can't remember) 105 divided
by 1.10 [correction:

00:22:33.193 --> 00:22:33.808
to the T].
 

00:22:33.808 --> 00:22:39.653
So in other words the interest
rate--I did that wrong--squared

00:22:39.653 --> 00:22:40.420
and T.
 

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.118
So the forwards,
in other words,

00:22:43.118 --> 00:22:47.212
1 i^(F)_t (small t) =
1 .10 for all t,

00:22:47.212 --> 00:22:50.608
so all the forwards are 10
percent.

00:22:50.608 --> 00:22:54.579
The bond is paying--I can't
remember which one I did.

00:22:54.579 --> 00:22:57.210
Let's do 20 here.
 

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:02.480
I'm going to make it a premium
bond, so it's paying 20.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:09.848
So what's going to be the price
of the bond?

00:23:09.848 --> 00:23:12.463
Well, in the first period it
looks like you get this

00:23:12.463 --> 00:23:13.490
incredible profit.
 

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:15.038
The interest rate is 10 percent.
 

00:23:15.038 --> 00:23:19.278
You've paid some present value
and you've made 20.

00:23:19.278 --> 00:23:21.867
You've made a number much
bigger--so the price of this

00:23:21.867 --> 00:23:24.359
thing, by the way what was the
home work problem?

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:26.660
What were the numbers?
 

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:31.180
What was the interest rate?
 

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.618
Did somebody do the homework?
 

00:23:32.618 --> 00:23:34.702
I did assign a homework on a
premium bond,

00:23:34.702 --> 00:23:35.108
right?
 

00:23:35.108 --> 00:23:38.457
The interest rate was 5 percent
and the coupon was 10,

00:23:38.457 --> 00:23:39.910
was that what it was?
 

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:42.349
What?
 

00:23:42.349 --> 00:23:46.619
What was it?
 

00:23:46.619 --> 00:23:49.039
What was the homework problem?
 

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:49.680
Student: 8 and 6.
 

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.430
Prof: 8 and 6.
 

00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:51.950
So this was 8 percent.
 

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:58.644
Might as well do this one,
6 here, yeah,

00:23:58.644 --> 00:24:04.140
6 percent, and this one was 8.
 

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:08.859
So what was the price
PV_0?

00:24:08.859 --> 00:24:12.980
What was PV_0?
 

00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:16.890
You've done this homework
problem, right?

00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:27.019
Does anyone remember what
number they got?

00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:29.029
Ben, do you remember the number?
 

00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:31.358
No.
 

00:24:31.358 --> 00:24:39.178
I'm counting on my trusty class
here to provide me all the

00:24:39.178 --> 00:24:40.549
numbers.
 

00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:41.690
It was what?
 

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.578
Student: 108.4.
 

00:24:43.578 --> 00:24:45.170
Prof: Was that what it
was, 108.4?

00:24:45.170 --> 00:24:47.759
That's all?
 

00:24:47.759 --> 00:24:57.740
This was the price just 108.4?
 

00:24:57.740 --> 00:24:58.980
So 108.4, right.
 

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.240
That's a high price.
 

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.240
So it's way above par.
 

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.839
This is a bond that's worth
much more than 100.

00:25:04.839 --> 00:25:05.480
Why?
 

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.686
Because the interest rate is 6
percent, but the coupon is 8 so

00:25:08.686 --> 00:25:10.368
this is called a premium bond.
 

00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:15.016
So if you look at the first
year the rate of return on the

00:25:15.016 --> 00:25:17.380
first year is 8 over 108.4.
 

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:21.269
Now, is that more than 6
percent?

00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:25.400
It is way more than 6 percent,
8 over 108.4.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:34.663
It is way more than 6 percent
because 7 percent of this is

00:25:34.663 --> 00:25:38.890
going to be less than 8.
 

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.981
So it's more than 7 percent,
so this is greater than 7

00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:47.230
percent, and so it's certainly
bigger than 6 percent.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:50.431
So it sure looks like at the
end of the first year like this

00:25:50.431 --> 00:25:51.680
bond was an ace bond.
 

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.788
That's the kind of calls you
used to get.

00:25:53.788 --> 00:25:57.387
You still sometimes do get them
if you're a wealthy person and

00:25:57.387 --> 00:25:59.690
you actually answer calls like
this,

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:02.229
which you don't of course,
but you can get some cold call

00:26:02.229 --> 00:26:04.788
from a sales person saying,
"We've got a fund and look

00:26:04.788 --> 00:26:05.598
how well it's doing.
 

00:26:05.598 --> 00:26:09.494
On this much investment last
year we got payments of 8

00:26:09.494 --> 00:26:10.230
dollars.
 

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:12.717
That's more than 7 percent,
and look, everybody can see the

00:26:12.717 --> 00:26:15.075
interest rate is only 6 percent
and we did better than 7

00:26:15.075 --> 00:26:15.589
percent.
 

00:26:15.589 --> 00:26:16.598
We're doing great.
 

00:26:16.598 --> 00:26:18.308
Why don't you invest in our
fund?"

00:26:18.308 --> 00:26:21.451
But actually,
what the salesman hasn't told

00:26:21.451 --> 00:26:25.338
you is that the value of his
assets has gone down.

00:26:25.338 --> 00:26:29.394
So the present value
PV_1 must be less than

00:26:29.394 --> 00:26:33.372
PV_0,
because we know from this

00:26:33.372 --> 00:26:37.180
formula, the formula right up
here,

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.810
that 6 percent is going to be
the cash flow over

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.722
PV_0 which is more
than 7 percent plus this

00:26:42.722 --> 00:26:44.472
difference,
and this difference,

00:26:44.472 --> 00:26:46.348
therefore, is going to have to
be negative.

00:26:46.348 --> 00:26:50.407
So what he didn't tell you was
that the fund lost value even

00:26:50.407 --> 00:26:53.847
though the first payment was
better than 6 percent,

00:26:53.847 --> 00:26:56.049
the market rate of interest.
 

00:26:56.049 --> 00:27:00.900
So that's the first example.
 

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:07.680
Now, let's do another example.
 

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:15.318
Suppose you have a--let's see
if I can write on this board.

00:27:15.318 --> 00:27:26.528
There's a famous trade called
the carry trade.

00:27:26.528 --> 00:27:30.101
Now, suppose the
forwards--suppose 1

00:27:30.101 --> 00:27:34.692
i^(F)_0 is 2 percent,
sort of like now,

00:27:34.692 --> 00:27:41.048
the 1 year yield,
and 1 i^(F)_t is 5

00:27:41.048 --> 00:27:47.200
percent,
for t greater than 1?

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.748
So if you have a 1 year bond
it's going to pay--well,

00:27:50.748 --> 00:27:54.842
let's say it's 2 percent and
this is equal to 1 --can you see

00:27:54.842 --> 00:27:56.890
this or it's disappearing.
 

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.053
So let's make the first two of
them be 2 percent,

00:28:01.053 --> 00:28:05.130
and this is for t greater than
or equal to 3.

00:28:05.130 --> 00:28:09.200
So the interest rate is 2
percent and then it's going to

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.680
jump to 5 percent.
 

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.358
All right, so if you have a
2-year bond,

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:22.181
a 2-year Treasury,
a 2-year bond might pay 2 and

00:28:22.181 --> 00:28:31.190
102 and the present value of
this equals 100,

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:37.480
the present value of the 2-year
bond.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:44.042
But now maybe you've got a
longer bond that's a 5-year bond

00:28:44.042 --> 00:28:56.232
which pays coupons 4,
4,4, 104, so this is a 5-year

00:28:56.232 --> 00:29:00.973
bond,
and maybe its price is close to

00:29:00.973 --> 00:29:01.368
100.
 

00:29:01.368 --> 00:29:04.173
Actually, I haven't worked out
the number so you're going to

00:29:04.173 --> 00:29:06.170
have to do that in the next
problem set.

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:09.338
So is it possible,
so I'll ask it this way,

00:29:09.338 --> 00:29:13.578
is it possible for this coupon
to be higher 4,

00:29:13.578 --> 00:29:18.602
4,4, 4,4 and yet still have a
present value of 100 than this

00:29:18.602 --> 00:29:20.730
one which is 2 and 102?
 

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:27.020
Could you have a higher coupon
and yet the same present value

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:32.160
of 100 on a longer bond than on
a shorter bond?

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:38.661
How could this bond have a
higher coupon and sell for the

00:29:38.661 --> 00:29:41.680
same price as this bond?
 

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.650
Yep?
 

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.924
Student: You're losing
money on the assets you put on

00:29:45.924 --> 00:29:48.979
the principal value because you
get it in a later period

00:29:48.979 --> 00:29:50.588
&gt;
 

00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:53.119
Prof: So the point is
you're discounting the first two

00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:56.086
payments by 2 percent a year,
but you're discounting these

00:29:56.086 --> 00:29:57.818
payments by 5 percent a year.
 

00:29:57.818 --> 00:30:00.190
So these things are going to be
much worse than they look.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:02.480
And so even though the 4s are
all better,

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.740
this 100, you know,
it's 4,4, 4,4,

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:08.477
4 100, that 100,
not to mention these three last

00:30:08.477 --> 00:30:11.420
4s are getting discounted by a
lot.

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:15.078
So that 104 is going to be
worth less than 100 back,

00:30:15.078 --> 00:30:17.950
you know, it's going to be
worth less.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:20.789
So that's why these things are
going to go down a lot more than

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:21.338
you think.
 

00:30:21.338 --> 00:30:22.970
They're going to be worth less
than 100.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.779
So even though these things are
better than the 2 percent rate

00:30:25.779 --> 00:30:27.577
of return--
this bond does great at the

00:30:27.577 --> 00:30:29.382
beginning,
but does poorly thereafter,

00:30:29.382 --> 00:30:31.928
because in the beginning it's
paying 4 percent when the

00:30:31.928 --> 00:30:34.767
interest rate is 2 percent,
but later it's paying 4 when

00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:38.401
the interest rate is 5 percent,
so clearly you could have some

00:30:38.401 --> 00:30:39.809
situation like that.
 

00:30:39.809 --> 00:30:41.578
So what's the carry trade?
 

00:30:41.578 --> 00:30:55.487
The carry trade is you buy the
long bond and sell short the

00:30:55.487 --> 00:31:08.434
short bond, so the lower
maturity--too many shorts--the

00:31:08.434 --> 00:31:14.190
lower maturity bond.
 

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:18.160
So this is the,
let's say, 5 year and 2 year.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:28.528
Buy the 5-year bond and sell
short the 2-year.

00:31:28.528 --> 00:31:32.038
The word, sell short,
is different from the word,

00:31:32.038 --> 00:31:32.990
short bond.
 

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:37.230
So you buy the 5-year bond and
you sell the 2-year bond.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:39.527
They both cost you 100,
so what's happening at the

00:31:39.527 --> 00:31:40.088
beginning?
 

00:31:40.088 --> 00:31:43.422
You're making 4 dollars and
you're only having to pay 2

00:31:43.422 --> 00:31:44.038
dollars.
 

00:31:44.038 --> 00:31:47.477
It looks like you're making a
profit for nothing,

00:31:47.477 --> 00:31:48.049
right?
 

00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:49.740
So that's the carry trade.
 

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:51.710
You buy long bonds with a high
rate of interest.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:55.470
You sell short bonds with low
coupons and it looks like you're

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:56.578
making a profit.
 

00:31:56.578 --> 00:31:58.680
But in fact,
what's really happening?

00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:00.730
So just repeat what you were
saying before,

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:02.000
but now in this context.
 

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.528
What's really happening?
 

00:32:03.528 --> 00:32:07.398
Student: You're paying
off that difference,

00:32:07.398 --> 00:32:10.480
the loss of the value of your
assets.

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:18.817
You're not getting back as much
as you would if you had just

00:32:18.817 --> 00:32:22.349
bought the 2-year bond.
 

00:32:22.349 --> 00:32:23.009
Prof: Right.
 

00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:26.548
So the long bond you got a cash
flow of 4 the first year.

00:32:26.548 --> 00:32:30.748
You had to pay 2 because you
sold the 2-year short,

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:31.420
right?
 

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:34.648
So you're up 2 dollars,
but the thing that you owe now

00:32:34.648 --> 00:32:37.962
at the end of the first year,
since the interest rate is 2

00:32:37.962 --> 00:32:39.727
percent,
the next interest rate is 2

00:32:39.727 --> 00:32:41.845
percent,
the 2-year bond is still worth

00:32:41.845 --> 00:32:42.118
100.
 

00:32:42.118 --> 00:32:45.529
So your negative position is
still worth 100,

00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:47.990
but this positive position now,
these 4,

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:50.833
4s and 4s it looks worse than
it did before because you've

00:32:50.833 --> 00:32:52.180
moved up the yield curve.
 

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:55.998
Instead of having two 2 percent
years you only got one 2 percent

00:32:55.998 --> 00:32:59.573
year before you shift into the 5
percents which is worse and

00:32:59.573 --> 00:33:00.180
worse.
 

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.480
So what's going to happen is
you're going to get a positive

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.722
cash flow at the beginning,
it looks like positive profits

00:33:06.722 --> 00:33:08.259
right at the beginning.
 

00:33:08.259 --> 00:33:12.118
That C (1), the net C (1) looks
really good,

00:33:12.118 --> 00:33:15.692
but right after that,
the value of your assets is

00:33:15.692 --> 00:33:19.338
going to plummet compared to
your liabilities,

00:33:19.338 --> 00:33:21.759
because now all of a sudden
you're discounting this at 5

00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:25.498
percent and this thing is still,
you know, it's only got 1 year

00:33:25.498 --> 00:33:30.041
left where the interest rate is
still 2 percent and the rest of

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:34.512
this is discounted at 5 percent
so it's starting to go down in

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:35.318
value.
 

00:33:35.318 --> 00:33:46.078
So if you didn't have to mark
to market what would you do?

00:33:46.078 --> 00:33:49.442
If you didn't have to declare
to the world what your present

00:33:49.442 --> 00:33:51.608
value of your remaining assets
are,

00:33:51.608 --> 00:33:52.690
because you could say,
"Oh,

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.048
it's so hard to figure out.
 

00:33:54.048 --> 00:33:56.173
I don't know what the stuff is
worth, the present value of

00:33:56.173 --> 00:33:57.029
what's going forward.
 

00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:58.818
I just know the cash that's
coming in."

00:33:58.818 --> 00:34:01.400
This carry trade would look
like a really good trade,

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.480
wouldn't it,
and a lot of people would do it

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.292
because then they would look--
the public would think that

00:34:06.292 --> 00:34:08.960
they're doing really well
because they're getting positive

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.007
value,
but in the future that positive

00:34:11.007 --> 00:34:13.806
value they're getting is just
disguising losses that are

00:34:13.806 --> 00:34:16.199
happening in their portfolios
going forward.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:19.329
So any questions about that?
 

00:34:19.329 --> 00:34:20.389
Yeah?
 

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:23.393
Student: Can you explain
where their losses

00:34:23.393 --> 00:34:25.110
&gt;?
 

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.320
Prof: I want you to
explain it.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.119
So I didn't calculate the
numbers.

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:31.768
It would have been better to do
actual numbers.

00:34:31.768 --> 00:34:35.780
If we do 4,4,
4 at 5 percent interest,

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:41.309
or maybe I can do a--let's just
do a real number.

00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:43.239
Well, let's just do the one
over here.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:45.952
So this one is--no,
I can't do it,

00:34:45.952 --> 00:34:49.980
because we've got 2 percent and
then 4 percent.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.067
So we take a minute to do it on
Excel and we've seen how great I

00:34:53.067 --> 00:34:54.440
am doing those on the fly.
 

00:34:54.440 --> 00:35:00.713
So the point is that you agree
that this payment 4 is bigger

00:35:00.713 --> 00:35:01.670
than 2.
 

00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:06.092
So the first year if you buy
this bond and you sell that bond

00:35:06.092 --> 00:35:09.630
you're going to have a positive
net 2 dollars.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:13.094
However, it's perfectly
possible for this whole bond at

00:35:13.094 --> 00:35:16.751
the beginning to be worth 100
the same as this bond at the

00:35:16.751 --> 00:35:17.650
beginning.
 

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:19.230
Now, how could that be?
 

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:23.644
Well, the payments--4 is bigger
than 2 so how could this whole

00:35:23.644 --> 00:35:27.409
thing have a higher present
value than this thing?

00:35:27.409 --> 00:35:32.840
It has to be that starting at
period 1 the present value of

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:38.646
this 5 year bond (let's call it
this) in period 1 - the present

00:35:38.646 --> 00:35:44.639
value of the 2 year bond staring
in period 1 has to be what?

00:35:44.639 --> 00:35:48.750
If this present value of the 5
year bond,

00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.869
this is the 5 year bond at time
0, equals 100,

00:35:52.869 --> 00:35:58.215
and that's exactly the same as
this present value at time 0 of

00:35:58.215 --> 00:36:00.815
the 2 year bond,
if that equals 100,

00:36:00.815 --> 00:36:03.717
so the present value from the
beginning of this thing is the

00:36:03.717 --> 00:36:06.768
same as the present value of
this thing from the beginning.

00:36:06.768 --> 00:36:08.989
How could this thing have value
100?

00:36:08.989 --> 00:36:12.000
Well, it's because it makes
lots of high coupon payments,

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.135
but the interest rate is going
to jump up in the future so

00:36:15.135 --> 00:36:18.105
you're discounting all these
future cash flows at a big

00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:18.710
number.
 

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:23.173
So all these things
present-valued could well equal

00:36:23.173 --> 00:36:23.710
100.
 

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.380
So this could be 100 and this
could be 100 even though this is

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:30.630
paying off more at the beginning
than this thing is.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.697
But what does that formula that
we just wrote down over there,

00:36:34.697 --> 00:36:36.900
what does this formula tell us?
 

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:41.710
Where was this formula that I
wrote down?

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:45.791
This formula over here tells us
if the present values of two

00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:48.779
instruments--
I see I wrote it for 1 bond,

00:36:48.779 --> 00:36:52.539
but if you take 2 bonds with
the same present value,

00:36:52.539 --> 00:36:55.760
one of which has a higher cash
flow in the first period than

00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.175
the other,
then that formula tells you the

00:36:58.175 --> 00:37:01.474
bond with the higher cash flow
at the beginning has to have a

00:37:01.474 --> 00:37:04.610
bigger drop in the present value
than the other bond,

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.389
otherwise you can't get them
both equal to the same 100.

00:37:07.389 --> 00:37:12.929
So this bond and this bond have
the same present value of 100.

00:37:12.929 --> 00:37:15.050
Because this payment is bigger
than this payment,

00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:16.670
but the present values are the
same,

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:19.789
100, it has to be that starting
from this point on,

00:37:19.789 --> 00:37:22.550
this bond is worth less than
that bond.

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:23.820
So what happens?
 

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.983
You go long this bond,
you short that bond,

00:37:25.983 --> 00:37:27.840
you say to the world,
"Ah ha!

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:28.920
I've made 2 dollars.
 

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:32.079
I'm a genius,"
and then you hide from them,

00:37:32.079 --> 00:37:34.130
you might hide from them if you
didn't have to tell them,

00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:37.574
they wouldn't know that the
present value of the bond you're

00:37:37.574 --> 00:37:40.902
long going forward is actually
lower by 2 dollars than the

00:37:40.902 --> 00:37:44.318
present value going forward--
this is right after this

00:37:44.318 --> 00:37:47.728
period--the present value
starting at this point of this

00:37:47.728 --> 00:37:51.324
bond going forward has actually
dropped 2 dollars below the

00:37:51.324 --> 00:37:54.239
present value of this bond going
forward,

00:37:54.239 --> 00:37:57.668
and it has to have dropped
otherwise the present values

00:37:57.668 --> 00:37:59.130
wouldn't be the same.
 

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:00.949
So to just say it much more
simply,

00:38:00.949 --> 00:38:04.076
if you take 2 bonds with the
same present value you could

00:38:04.076 --> 00:38:07.538
well have that situation where
they have the same present value

00:38:07.538 --> 00:38:11.000
because one of the bonds pays a
lot of stuff early and terrible

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.949
stuff late.
 

00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:14.445
So in the beginning it looks
like this bond is paying you

00:38:14.445 --> 00:38:17.311
more money than the other bond,
but since they have the same

00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:20.206
present value it must mean that
this bond is going to pay you

00:38:20.206 --> 00:38:22.329
more money at the tail than this
bond is.

00:38:22.329 --> 00:38:24.230
That's why they had the same
present value.

00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:27.230
So if one of them gets ahead at
the beginning it has to be it's

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.360
going to fall behind the rest of
the time.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.947
So this one got ahead at the
beginning, it has to fall behind

00:38:31.947 --> 00:38:32.940
the rest of the time.
 

00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:36.615
That's hard to see because it
looks like this bond it's paying

00:38:36.615 --> 00:38:39.449
a coupon that's always bigger
than that bond.

00:38:39.449 --> 00:38:42.639
So it's easy to lose track of
the fact that this bond,

00:38:42.639 --> 00:38:45.228
because its coupon is higher
than this bond,

00:38:45.228 --> 00:38:48.360
how could it possibly ever fall
below this bond?

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.952
Well, it falls below because
it's longer and the cash flows

00:38:51.952 --> 00:38:56.039
towards the end of it are being
discounted by an interest rate--

00:38:56.039 --> 00:39:00.860
because everybody knows the
interest rate's going to go up.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:03.949
And remember we saw last time
the yield curve.

00:39:03.949 --> 00:39:07.034
The yield curve,
remember today's yield curve is

00:39:07.034 --> 00:39:10.842
practically 0 now because the
government's held it at 0 and

00:39:10.842 --> 00:39:14.782
it's going to go way up to 4
percent or something in a couple

00:39:14.782 --> 00:39:15.570
years.
 

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.829
So that's the yield curve today.
 

00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:20.336
So everybody knows the interest
rates are really low now and

00:39:20.336 --> 00:39:22.079
they're going to get much higher
later.

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:24.989
So what it means is that every
long bond that's being issued

00:39:24.989 --> 00:39:27.947
now is going to be issued with a
higher coupon than the short

00:39:27.947 --> 00:39:29.726
bonds,
and if you go long the long

00:39:29.726 --> 00:39:32.385
bond and short the short bond
you're going to make money at

00:39:32.385 --> 00:39:34.219
the beginning but lose it back
later.

00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:36.989
But if you don't have to report
mark to market,

00:39:36.989 --> 00:39:39.239
you don't have to say the value
of what's left over,

00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:43.175
the public's just going to see
that you're making money at the

00:39:43.175 --> 00:39:43.949
beginning.
 

00:39:43.949 --> 00:39:45.179
It's clear now?
 

00:39:45.179 --> 00:39:47.510
Any other questions about this?
 

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:53.239
So a lot of this is going on
right now.

00:39:53.239 --> 00:39:56.349
So let's do one more
application of this.

00:39:56.349 --> 00:40:03.380
Let's explain how mortgages
work, one more idea.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:10.635
Since the present value is = to
the cash flow the present value

00:40:10.635 --> 00:40:14.007
at 1 times that,
given this formula,

00:40:14.007 --> 00:40:17.400
that tells you one more thing,
very important idea.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.469
How do you compute present
value 0?

00:40:20.469 --> 00:40:23.644
Well, the way we've always
computed present value at 0 is

00:40:23.644 --> 00:40:26.496
to do this calculation,
this long calculation

00:40:26.496 --> 00:40:29.119
discounting all the future cash
flows,

00:40:29.119 --> 00:40:32.536
but this formula tells you that
there's actually a more

00:40:32.536 --> 00:40:36.079
efficient way of calculating it
by backward induction.

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:39.943
If I knew what the present
value was at time 1 then I could

00:40:39.943 --> 00:40:43.610
get the present value at time 0
just by this formula.

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:46.585
I'd add the present value at
time 1 to the cash at time 1 and

00:40:46.585 --> 00:40:47.280
discount it.
 

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:49.967
So in fact I don't have
to--now, I don't know the

00:40:49.967 --> 00:40:53.126
present value at time 1,
but if I go to the end,

00:40:53.126 --> 00:40:55.943
at the end of time,
I know the present value of the

00:40:55.943 --> 00:40:56.409
bond is 0.
 

00:40:56.409 --> 00:40:57.940
There's nothing coming up later.
 

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:01.181
At time T - 1 I know the
present value's very easy to

00:41:01.181 --> 00:41:01.929
calculate.
 

00:41:01.929 --> 00:41:07.030
It's C (T) divided by 1
i^(F)_T - 1.

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:12.179
So I can go backwards by
present value and compute.

00:41:12.179 --> 00:41:13.518
I can do backward induction.
 

00:41:13.518 --> 00:41:17.394
So that's the word I want to
describe which is going to play

00:41:17.394 --> 00:41:20.548
a very important role in the
future of the class,

00:41:20.548 --> 00:41:22.059
backward induction.
 

00:41:22.059 --> 00:41:25.840
It says if this formula is
correct then a good way to do

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:29.619
the computation is by working
backwards from the end.

00:41:29.619 --> 00:41:31.949
Don't just blindly take the
present value.

00:41:31.949 --> 00:41:34.938
If you blindly take the present
value all you've got is

00:41:34.938 --> 00:41:35.880
PV_0.
 

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.233
If I calculate by backward
induction I start to the end and

00:41:39.233 --> 00:41:41.429
say, what would PV_T-1
be?

00:41:41.429 --> 00:41:42.559
That's a really simple thing.
 

00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:45.527
Then I can very simply find out
what PV_T-2 is

00:41:45.527 --> 00:41:47.309
etcetera back to the beginning.
 

00:41:47.309 --> 00:41:51.402
I do basically the same
calculation without having to

00:41:51.402 --> 00:41:54.659
take powers of--
it's a shorter calculation

00:41:54.659 --> 00:41:58.907
because here I've got exponents
of interest rates multiplying

00:41:58.907 --> 00:41:59.900
each other.
 

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:01.530
So it's actually a shorter
calculation,

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.317
and on top of that I get much
more information because now

00:42:04.317 --> 00:42:07.153
I've calculated out what the
present value's going to be at

00:42:07.153 --> 00:42:08.230
every time period.
 

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:11.215
So a much more efficient way of
calculating things is to do it

00:42:11.215 --> 00:42:13.860
by backward induction because it
also tells me more.

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:19.050
It tells me what the future
path of the bond is going to be.

00:42:19.050 --> 00:42:23.059
So let's just see how that
works on an example that I hope

00:42:23.059 --> 00:42:25.239
I worked out properly before.
 

00:42:25.239 --> 00:42:27.684
Of course, I did it last year,
but let's assume I did it

00:42:27.684 --> 00:42:28.039
right.
 

00:42:28.039 --> 00:42:33.599
So let's take a mortgage,
if you can see this.

00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:35.170
So this is something you have
in your notes.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:37.059
So there's a mortgage.
 

00:42:37.059 --> 00:42:46.480
Now, how does a--all right,
well pay no attention to that.

00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:53.269
So let's just say that--oh no,
why did this happen?

00:42:53.269 --> 00:43:10.420
Let's say that the payment is 8.
 

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:15.159
So I've made payments of 8
everywhere.

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:16.079
I hope I haven't screwed this
up.

00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:16.989
So here's the mortgage.
 

00:43:16.989 --> 00:43:18.820
It's a 30-year mortgage.
 

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.641
So these are the years 1,2,
3,4, 5,6, 7,

00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:27.639
blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah up to year 30.

00:43:27.639 --> 00:43:32.442
Now, suppose I happen to have a
bond that pays a coupon of 8

00:43:32.442 --> 00:43:35.780
dollars every year,
and the interest rate,

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.059
let's say, is 7 percent.
 

00:43:38.059 --> 00:43:39.469
So it would be the interest
rate on the mortgage,

00:43:39.469 --> 00:43:42.452
but let's say the interest rate
in the economy is 7 percent and

00:43:42.452 --> 00:43:44.940
the bond,
however, is a premium bond.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.829
The bond is paying 8 percent
every year.

00:43:48.829 --> 00:44:06.469
Now, this is a mortgage so what
does this mean?

00:44:06.469 --> 00:44:10.253
See the mortgage pays 8 every
year until the very last year

00:44:10.253 --> 00:44:12.079
where it's still paying 8.
 

00:44:12.079 --> 00:44:15.119
So it's not paying 108,
it's just paying 8 every year.

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.449
So it's not a coupon bond.
 

00:44:16.449 --> 00:44:17.320
It's a mortgage.
 

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.369
A mortgage pays the same amount
every year until the end.

00:44:20.369 --> 00:44:24.690
So if this were a coupon bond
the last payment would be 108

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:28.340
and of course the thing would be
a tremendous--

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.088
it would be a premium bond
because the interest rate's only

00:44:31.088 --> 00:44:34.170
7 because it would pay a higher
coupon of 8 and 108 at the end.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:36.980
But you see I'm not paying 108
at the end.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.679
I'm only paying 8 at the end.
 

00:44:38.679 --> 00:44:44.885
So the first question is,
what is the present value of

00:44:44.885 --> 00:44:46.289
this bond?
 

00:44:46.289 --> 00:44:50.529
So I could take 8 divided by
1.07 8 divided by 1.07 squared

00:44:50.529 --> 00:44:55.059
(all the way) 8 over 1.07 to the
thirtieth power and figure out

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.230
that number.
 

00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:59.409
But a much better way of doing
it is by backward induction.

00:44:59.409 --> 00:45:00.409
So what do I do?
 

00:45:00.409 --> 00:45:05.289
I go to the end and I say this
line is the remaining balance.

00:45:05.289 --> 00:45:10.123
Well, at year 30 there'd be no
more payments of the bond so the

00:45:10.123 --> 00:45:13.710
present value of what's left is
obviously 0.

00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:18.639
Now, what is the present value
of what's left at time 29?

00:45:18.639 --> 00:45:22.405
Well, the only thing I'm going
to get is I'm going to get this

00:45:22.405 --> 00:45:24.690
payment at time 8 right over
there.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:26.170
Sorry.
 

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:30.831
I'm going to get this 8 right
there and so the present value

00:45:30.831 --> 00:45:34.152
of 8 at 7 percent interest is
7.47, I mean,

00:45:34.152 --> 00:45:35.969
7 percent interest.
 

00:45:35.969 --> 00:45:39.579
So how did I figure that out?
 

00:45:39.579 --> 00:45:42.210
I just said,
take that payment on the right

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:45.030
and discount it by 7 percent,
so it's 7.47.

00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:46.849
Now, what's the present value
here?

00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:50.039
Well, here you're going to get
two things.

00:45:50.039 --> 00:45:51.150
What are you going to get?
 

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:53.599
You're going to get a coupon
payment.

00:45:53.599 --> 00:45:57.085
Just after the payment in year
28 what's the present value of

00:45:57.085 --> 00:45:57.900
what's left?
 

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:03.090
You're going to get a payment
in year 29 of 8 dollars.

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:06.070
You're also going to get one in
year 30, but you don't care

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:06.739
about that.
 

00:46:06.739 --> 00:46:11.226
You just know that the value in
year 29 is the coupon you get in

00:46:11.226 --> 00:46:15.429
year 29 plus the present value
in year 29 of what's left.

00:46:15.429 --> 00:46:19.210
The PV at time t,
I can just put a t here,

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:24.869
PV at time t is the coupon you
get at time t 1,

00:46:24.869 --> 00:46:33.000
the present value at time t 1
divided by the interest rate at

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.219
time t.
 

00:46:34.219 --> 00:46:39.800
So all I have to do is take 8
7.47 and discount that by 7

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:45.880
percent, and that gives me the
present value as of time 28.

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:49.972
So if I go back to time 26 I
say, well, how do I figure out

00:46:49.972 --> 00:46:52.159
the present value at time 27?
 

00:46:52.159 --> 00:46:53.489
It's time 27.
 

00:46:53.489 --> 00:46:56.960
I say, well,
I'm going to get 8 at time 28,

00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.838
but the present value at that
time, just after that payment,

00:47:01.838 --> 00:47:02.829
is 14.4.
 

00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:07.789
So I take 22.4 and discount it
by 7 percent and I get about 21.

00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:10.938
So that's how I can work
backwards and figure out the

00:47:10.938 --> 00:47:12.268
present value today.
 

00:47:12.268 --> 00:47:15.409
Now, in mortgages this number
is very interesting.

00:47:15.409 --> 00:47:19.601
It's called the remaining
balance, which we'll see in a

00:47:19.601 --> 00:47:20.300
second.
 

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:22.530
But anyway, that number you can
calculate it every t.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.179
It's just the PV_t
worked backward from the end.

00:47:25.179 --> 00:47:29.197
So it's a very simple
calculation and it tells you the

00:47:29.197 --> 00:47:33.063
present value of the bond,
of that 8 percent coupon,

00:47:33.063 --> 00:47:36.550
until year 30 and no principal
at the end.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:40.961
Well, a mortgage has to pay a
coupon of 8 percent that gives

00:47:40.961 --> 00:47:45.150
100 because if there were no
uncertainty and there are no

00:47:45.150 --> 00:47:48.273
prepayments or anything,
no uncertainty,

00:47:48.273 --> 00:47:51.833
the bank giving the coupon is
not going to give you money

00:47:51.833 --> 00:47:54.630
unless its present value is
equal to 100.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:58.539
So they're going to ask you to
pay a coupon.

00:47:58.539 --> 00:48:00.960
So now you see what have I done
over here?

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.590
This is B 26 - B 30,
so the original face it was

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:09.099
supposed to be 100,
but the present value of all

00:48:09.099 --> 00:48:13.717
those payments is only 99,
so there's a gap here of .72

00:48:13.717 --> 00:48:15.980
and the square of the gap is
that.

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.480
The square of the gap is there,
and we want to minimize that.

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:27.612
So we're going to find the
payment every period,

00:48:27.612 --> 00:48:28.980
Solver.
 

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:33.701
So I want to minimize B 32,
minimize by choosing B 29 which

00:48:33.701 --> 00:48:34.760
looks good.
 

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:41.074
That's the first payment,
and all the other payments are

00:48:41.074 --> 00:48:47.389
set to be equal to that,
to minimize that difference.

00:48:47.389 --> 00:48:52.280
B 29 is the first payment,
so why didn't this work?

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:56.222
Student: You hardwired
in C 29 and D 29

00:48:56.222 --> 00:48:58.590
&gt;
 

00:48:58.590 --> 00:48:59.679
Prof: Is that what I did?
 

00:48:59.679 --> 00:49:05.480
So here's 8 and then this over
here.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.559
I hardwired that in,
so I didn't want to do that.

00:49:08.559 --> 00:49:15.148
So that's got to be equal to
what's left, equal,

00:49:15.148 --> 00:49:16.130
left.
 

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:18.429
So here I got--when I hardwire
this then, okay,

00:49:18.429 --> 00:49:19.280
so that's good.
 

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.730
So let's try the same thing now.
 

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:25.153
Tools, glad I have you guys,
Tools, so B 32 is what I'm

00:49:25.153 --> 00:49:26.219
minimizing.
 

00:49:26.219 --> 00:49:30.088
B 29 is the first payment and
all the others have been set

00:49:30.088 --> 00:49:32.260
equal to it, and if I solve...
 

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:37.760
Student: C 29.
 

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.150
Prof: All right,
let's try.

00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:43.672
The first payment is year 1,
right, so it should be--oh,

00:49:43.672 --> 00:49:45.480
C 29, thank you.
 

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:50.139
Yeah, that's why I'm confused,
C 29, thanks.

00:49:50.139 --> 00:50:00.630
Tools, so let's just look at
this a second.

00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:03.070
So that's what I've hardwired
in.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:07.380
So Format, no Tools, Solver.
 

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:15.590
Minimize B 32 subject to C 29
as you've told me 20 times,

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:18.670
C 29 and now solve.
 

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.650
So now we did it.
 

00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:23.597
So we got the right payment to
make the balance exactly equal

00:50:23.597 --> 00:50:24.039
to 100.
 

00:50:24.039 --> 00:50:25.969
So that's how a mortgage works.
 

00:50:25.969 --> 00:50:28.847
You have to find the coupon
payment such that if you take

00:50:28.847 --> 00:50:32.034
the present value of that same
coupon payment forever it's just

00:50:32.034 --> 00:50:34.449
going to be worth 100 which is
that number.

00:50:34.449 --> 00:50:36.510
And how do you figure out the
coupon payment?

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:38.119
Well, you do it by backward
inductions.

00:50:38.119 --> 00:50:39.250
Figure out the present value.
 

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:43.000
Do it by backward induction
just as we did.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.559
But we've gotten a lot of
information.

00:50:45.559 --> 00:50:47.500
We've gotten this number at
every period.

00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:50.956
So by doing it by backward
induction instead of just doing

00:50:50.956 --> 00:50:53.139
the long exponential
calculation,

00:50:53.139 --> 00:50:55.909
by doing it by backward
induction we've produced the

00:50:55.909 --> 00:50:58.300
present value at every time in
the future.

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.849
Now, that's an incredibly
important number in mortgages.

00:51:00.849 --> 00:51:02.650
It's called the remaining
balance.

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:06.159
Why is that such an important
number in mortgages?

00:51:06.159 --> 00:51:08.909
This will play a very key role
in the rest of the course.

00:51:08.909 --> 00:51:12.440
What is the remaining balance
and why is it so important?

00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.929
Does anyone know how a mortgage
works?

00:51:13.929 --> 00:51:14.780
Yep?
 

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.989
Student: Is that the
mark to market value or just

00:51:17.989 --> 00:51:21.610
whatever you'd be able to sell
that mortgage for to someone?

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:24.923
Prof: Not what you'd be
able to sell it for,

00:51:24.923 --> 00:51:25.719
but close.
 

00:51:25.719 --> 00:51:29.563
So when the bank gives you a
mortgage it says--so how did

00:51:29.563 --> 00:51:30.730
mortgages work?
 

00:51:30.730 --> 00:51:34.331
It used to be in the old days
that the mortgages were coupon

00:51:34.331 --> 00:51:34.820
bonds.
 

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:38.469
They'd pay 8,8,
8,8, 8,108, and then what would

00:51:38.469 --> 00:51:43.469
happen is just before the 108
payment everyone would default.

00:51:43.469 --> 00:51:45.822
So in the Depression the people
who defaulted were people who

00:51:45.822 --> 00:51:47.900
defaulted just before their big
principal payment,

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.360
so bankers got wise after the
Depression.

00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:52.289
They said, "Well,
that's a terrible thing to do.

00:51:52.289 --> 00:51:55.400
We should make the payment be
constant and that way there's no

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.407
reason for the guy to default
right at the end and we're not

00:51:58.407 --> 00:52:01.570
going to get stuck with 100
dollars that's not paid."

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:02.909
So it's constant.
 

00:52:02.909 --> 00:52:05.733
But of course if it's constant
that means the present value of

00:52:05.733 --> 00:52:07.679
what's left is going down all
the time,

00:52:07.679 --> 00:52:10.900
so that's why this number is
going down all the time.

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.141
If it's 108 at the end,
that's why the present value

00:52:13.141 --> 00:52:14.110
would stay the same.
 

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:18.682
So it's going down all the
time, so that's why it's called

00:52:18.682 --> 00:52:20.690
an amortizing mortgage.
 

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:23.822
It's because what's left in the
mortgage is getting smaller all

00:52:23.822 --> 00:52:24.380
the time.
 

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:30.050
So a fixed rate mortgage pays
the same coupon every year.

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.036
The present value of what's
left, therefore,

00:52:32.036 --> 00:52:34.577
must be going down every year
and that's why it's called

00:52:34.577 --> 00:52:35.268
amortizing.
 

00:52:35.268 --> 00:52:38.594
And bankers wanted that to
happen because that way their

00:52:38.594 --> 00:52:40.530
risk is going down every year.
 

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:43.556
Every year the house is
presumably still worth 120 or

00:52:43.556 --> 00:52:47.164
whatever it was at the beginning
and the amount owed is getting

00:52:47.164 --> 00:52:48.329
lower and lower.
 

00:52:48.329 --> 00:52:51.434
So the bankers are feeling more
and more secure every year

00:52:51.434 --> 00:52:54.650
because the house is backing a
smaller and smaller loan,

00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:56.934
or to put it another way,
if you're uncertain about what

00:52:56.934 --> 00:52:58.929
the price of the house will be
in the future,

00:52:58.929 --> 00:53:01.974
you want to make sure that what
is owed is going down in the

00:53:01.974 --> 00:53:02.440
future.
 

00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.643
If the price gradually goes
down of the house what's owed is

00:53:05.643 --> 00:53:07.219
gradually going to go down.
 

00:53:07.219 --> 00:53:10.327
But the main reason why the
number is so important is you

00:53:10.327 --> 00:53:13.822
have to realize the purpose of a
mortgage is you take out a loan

00:53:13.822 --> 00:53:15.710
using the house as collateral.
 

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:17.349
If you don't make your payment
they can take your house.

00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:18.880
Well, what happens if you want
to move?

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.090
If you want to move you're
going to sell the house.

00:53:22.090 --> 00:53:24.918
The house is no longer
collateral, so if you want to

00:53:24.918 --> 00:53:27.579
move you have to undo the
promise to the bank.

00:53:27.579 --> 00:53:30.947
So if in year 5 just after
you're making your payment of 8

00:53:30.947 --> 00:53:34.018
dollars and 5 cents in year 5
you decide to move,

00:53:34.018 --> 00:53:36.210
you say to the bank,
"I want to cancel the

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:37.018
mortgage."
 

00:53:37.018 --> 00:53:38.719
How much will they ask you to
pay?

00:53:38.719 --> 00:53:42.159
Well, the remaining balance,
93.91.

00:53:42.159 --> 00:53:47.173
So that's why this remaining
balance is such an important

00:53:47.173 --> 00:53:47.980
number.
 

00:53:47.980 --> 00:53:51.597
So it allows people to leave
their house and pay off their

00:53:51.597 --> 00:53:54.579
mortgage by paying off the
remaining balance.

00:53:54.579 --> 00:53:57.186
You wouldn't want them to pay
100 if they left because they've

00:53:57.186 --> 00:53:57.869
made payments.
 

00:53:57.869 --> 00:54:00.940
You notice that the payment
here is 8 dollars.

00:54:00.940 --> 00:54:04.733
That's bigger than 7 percent,
right, because if it's a coupon

00:54:04.733 --> 00:54:08.150
bond you'd pay 7 all the way to
the end and pay 107.

00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:09.539
That would have a present value
of 100.

00:54:09.539 --> 00:54:11.320
If you're not paying the 100 at
the end,

00:54:11.320 --> 00:54:13.000
but just making a level payment
all the way through,

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.384
the payment you have to make
every year better be more than

00:54:15.384 --> 00:54:16.760
7,
so it's 8.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:21.016
So this 8 - 7 is sort of what
you're paying down of your

00:54:21.016 --> 00:54:22.409
mortgage, right?
 

00:54:22.409 --> 00:54:23.780
The interest is only 7.
 

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:24.670
You've paid 8.
 

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:26.369
That's why you owe less than
100.

00:54:26.369 --> 00:54:29.360
You've paid 1 dollar 6 extra.
 

00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.268
That's why you only owe 98.94.
 

00:54:33.268 --> 00:54:35.960
So every year you're paying
part of your principal down.

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.396
That means it's amortizing,
and that means if you want to

00:54:38.396 --> 00:54:41.137
get out of the mortgage you can
get out of it by paying less and

00:54:41.137 --> 00:54:41.530
less.
 

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:43.438
It means the lender,
the mortgage lender,

00:54:43.438 --> 00:54:46.157
is more and more protected by
the house every year because

00:54:46.157 --> 00:54:47.780
what you owe is less and less.
 

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.610
So that's how a mortgage works.
 

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:52.739
Any questions about that?
 

00:54:52.739 --> 00:54:55.349
All right, so what's the point?
 

00:54:55.349 --> 00:54:58.779
The point is that by simple
present value thinking you can

00:54:58.779 --> 00:55:02.329
start to understand the main
instruments in the economy,

00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:05.579
how mortgages work,
why they're called amortizing,

00:55:05.579 --> 00:55:08.150
why the amount you have to pay
to get out of your mortgage goes

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:11.050
down every year,
and exactly how much it goes

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:13.010
down every year etcetera.
 

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.659
So we can do a lot more
examples like that,

00:55:15.659 --> 00:55:20.516
but I want to change,
shift the discussion now to a

00:55:20.516 --> 00:55:25.621
much bigger subject,
a subject of tremendous policy

00:55:25.621 --> 00:55:29.630
interest in the country,
namely Social Security.

00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:32.630
What should we do about Social
Security?

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:35.954
Now, it will turn out that you
can analyze the situation the

00:55:35.954 --> 00:55:38.380
same way we've just analyzed
these bonds.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.005
It's very simple to figure out
what the problem is and what

00:55:41.005 --> 00:55:43.483
went wrong,
yet very few people understand

00:55:43.483 --> 00:55:46.190
it, including most of our
politicians and,

00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:48.210
I'm sorry to say,
a lot of our economists.

00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:53.914
So I want to describe now in
the next class and a half the

00:55:53.914 --> 00:55:59.518
Social Security problem and how
to solve the problem,

00:55:59.518 --> 00:56:01.130
but also how to understand the
problem.

00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:04.023
You can't figure out the right
solution until you've understood

00:56:04.023 --> 00:56:05.050
what the problem is.
 

00:56:05.050 --> 00:56:07.809
So were there any questions?
 

00:56:07.809 --> 00:56:09.590
Before I start this,
were there any questions?

00:56:09.590 --> 00:56:10.210
I should have paused.
 

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:13.614
Are there any questions about
the mortgage,

00:56:13.614 --> 00:56:17.262
or present value,
or how present value changes

00:56:17.262 --> 00:56:18.639
through time?
 

00:56:18.639 --> 00:56:20.773
So those ideas,
and marking to market,

00:56:20.773 --> 00:56:24.117
those are very important ideas
I think once you think about

00:56:24.117 --> 00:56:25.329
them not so hard.
 

00:56:25.329 --> 00:56:28.865
I'm now going to take exactly
those ideas and apply it to

00:56:28.865 --> 00:56:32.340
Social Security where the public
is totally baffled,

00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.610
but all you have to do is apply
the same thinking.

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:37.518
So Social Security is supposed
to be in a terrible crisis.

00:56:37.518 --> 00:56:42.159
That's what they always tell
you.

00:56:42.159 --> 00:56:44.699
It was a big campaign issue in
2000,

00:56:44.699 --> 00:56:46.530
you probably were too young to
remember that,

00:56:46.530 --> 00:56:50.117
but there were three debates
between Gore and Bush in which

00:56:50.117 --> 00:56:53.768
Gore grimaced and everybody
thought he wasn't a good guy and

00:56:53.768 --> 00:56:55.440
so they voted for Bush.
 

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.590
He was mostly grimacing about
Social Security.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.949
And then in 2000--well,
I'll get to the future.

00:57:01.949 --> 00:57:06.429
So anyway, in those debates
three mistakes were made.

00:57:06.429 --> 00:57:11.126
So Bush argued that the returns
on Social Security were

00:57:11.126 --> 00:57:12.780
disastrously low.
 

00:57:12.780 --> 00:57:20.425
He said the whole program is in
a terrible crisis and we've got

00:57:20.425 --> 00:57:24.619
to privatize to save the system.
 

00:57:24.619 --> 00:57:26.079
How did it get into the crisis?
 

00:57:26.079 --> 00:57:28.514
Well, it wasn't clear exactly
how it got into the crisis,

00:57:28.514 --> 00:57:31.034
but it seems like the baby
boomers had something to do with

00:57:31.034 --> 00:57:31.340
it.
 

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:33.644
They're all getting old and
they're going to have to get

00:57:33.644 --> 00:57:35.280
these huge Social Security
payments,

00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:37.293
and that's why we're in the
crisis because the baby boomers

00:57:37.293 --> 00:57:37.920
are getting old.
 

00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:41.789
It's all my fault,
or my generation's fault.

00:57:41.789 --> 00:57:45.387
Then the third mistake was Gore
said, "Well,

00:57:45.387 --> 00:57:48.159
it's impossible to
privatize."

00:57:48.159 --> 00:57:51.498
Privatize means take the money
that your parents are paying in

00:57:51.498 --> 00:57:54.070
Social Security and that you'll
start to pay;

00:57:54.070 --> 00:57:57.670
instead of putting it into the
fund that's being used somehow,

00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:59.420
you don't probably know exactly
how,

00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:03.289
instead of doing that,
take that money and say it's

00:58:03.289 --> 00:58:05.070
the taxpayer's money.
 

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:05.929
It's your money.
 

00:58:05.929 --> 00:58:08.090
You can put it in the stock
market if you want.

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:11.454
So that's what Bush wanted to
do, privatize Social Security,

00:58:11.454 --> 00:58:14.590
say your tax contributions
should go into a stock market

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:16.130
with your name on them.
 

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:17.989
And Gore said,
"Well, that's impossible.

00:58:17.989 --> 00:58:20.373
If you privatize,
what are the old people today

00:58:20.373 --> 00:58:21.099
going to do?
 

00:58:21.099 --> 00:58:22.449
Where are they going to get the
payments?

00:58:22.449 --> 00:58:26.072
You can't privatize Social
Security and take today's young

00:58:26.072 --> 00:58:28.867
tax contributions to Social
Security and say,

00:58:28.867 --> 00:58:31.409
'You young guys,
there's your money.

00:58:31.409 --> 00:58:34.360
You can keep them in the stock
market,' and at the same time

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.960
pay the old retirees,
so Bush must not know what he's

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.159
talking about."
 

00:58:38.159 --> 00:58:40.460
So that also was wrong.
 

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:44.313
So those three things,
that Social Security is going

00:58:44.313 --> 00:58:47.610
to give terrible returns,
it must be it's wasting money,

00:58:47.610 --> 00:58:50.012
something's horribly wrong with
it and the only way to save it

00:58:50.012 --> 00:58:50.880
is to privatize it.
 

00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.380
That's Bush's main claim.
 

00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:54.179
Blame it all on the baby
generation,

00:58:54.179 --> 00:58:56.385
that's everybody's claim,
and Gore saying you can't

00:58:56.385 --> 00:58:58.679
privatize without screwing
today's young [correction:

00:58:58.679 --> 00:58:59.650
today's retirees].
 

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:02.969
All three of those things sound
pretty convincing and yet

00:59:02.969 --> 00:59:04.510
they're all three wrong.
 

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:07.742
So I want to explain the system
to you and help you understand

00:59:07.742 --> 00:59:09.626
it,
and then I have a policy

00:59:09.626 --> 00:59:13.480
recommendation you'll get next
class which most people don't

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:17.079
agree with,
so you probably won't either,

00:59:17.079 --> 00:59:22.768
but I'll warn you when we get
to a point that's controversial.

00:59:22.768 --> 00:59:26.425
So everything I'm going to say
in the first 90 minutes is going

00:59:26.425 --> 00:59:27.840
to be uncontroversial.
 

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.166
Not everybody knows it,
but I think it's obviously just

00:59:30.166 --> 00:59:31.030
a matter of logic.
 

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:34.320
And then my conclusion about
what to do, you can criticize

00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:34.610
it.
 

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:37.125
I think it's a matter of logic
too, but I admit most people

00:59:37.125 --> 00:59:38.079
don't agree with it.
 

00:59:38.079 --> 00:59:42.775
So now, in 2005 if nothing else
Bush was tremendously

00:59:42.775 --> 00:59:43.949
consistent.
 

00:59:43.949 --> 00:59:47.003
So whatever he told you he was
going to do no matter how

00:59:47.003 --> 00:59:48.780
wrong-handed it was he did it.
 

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:51.987
So he said in the debates that
he wanted to privatize Social

00:59:51.987 --> 00:59:54.380
Security and sure enough he kept
his word.

00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.230
He launched a huge program.
 

00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:58.949
That's how he started right
after the 2004 election.

00:59:58.949 --> 01:00:01.157
His first initiative,
you might remember,

01:00:01.157 --> 01:00:03.639
was we've got to privatize
Social Security.

01:00:03.639 --> 01:00:08.152
He went on a 60-day,
60-city tour to kick off his

01:00:08.152 --> 01:00:09.469
second term.
 

01:00:09.469 --> 01:00:12.762
So after the 2004 election
privatizing Social Security was

01:00:12.762 --> 01:00:13.630
a huge issue.
 

01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:16.710
In the 2008 election it was
still a big issue.

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:19.219
McCain said sort of what Bush
said.

01:00:19.219 --> 01:00:22.030
"I want young workers to
be able to if they choose,

01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:24.420
to take part of their own money
which is their taxes,

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:26.360
their money that's getting
taxed and getting put into

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.182
Social Security,
I want them to have their own

01:00:28.182 --> 01:00:30.409
account and put it into the
stock market with their name on

01:00:30.409 --> 01:00:30.869
it."
 

01:00:30.869 --> 01:00:35.440
And Obama said he's totally
against that.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.670
That was 2008.
 

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:40.677
Recently, of course,
the public has made another

01:00:40.677 --> 01:00:41.530
mistake.
 

01:00:41.530 --> 01:00:45.389
So everybody is saying now,
"Oh, the financial crisis.

01:00:45.389 --> 01:00:47.550
We better not talk about Social
Security anymore."

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:49.989
Nobody's talking about Social
Security.

01:00:49.989 --> 01:00:53.365
They're saying, "Well,
could you have imagined what

01:00:53.365 --> 01:00:56.188
would have happened had we
privatized as Bush wanted us to

01:00:56.188 --> 01:00:58.018
do and the stock market
collapsed?

01:00:58.018 --> 01:00:59.530
Everybody would have lost all
their money.

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:03.054
What a disaster that would have
been, and it would have ruined

01:01:03.054 --> 01:01:03.980
the old."
 

01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.489
This sounds pretty persuasive.
 

01:01:05.489 --> 01:01:08.829
So Krugman wrote a column
saying, "A bullet dodged.

01:01:08.829 --> 01:01:11.039
What would have happened if
Bush had succeeded?

01:01:11.039 --> 01:01:13.340
All the old people would be
broke now."

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:17.411
And Robert Reich who was in the
Clinton Administration sort of

01:01:17.411 --> 01:01:21.349
more or less said the same thing
that it'd be a disaster.

01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:24.320
Now, the Obama Administration,
by the way, hasn't stopped

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.018
talking about Social Security.
 

01:01:26.018 --> 01:01:28.670
So their director,
he's the Director of the White

01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:31.485
House Office of the Budget,
so this is an incredibly

01:01:31.485 --> 01:01:33.530
important position,
Peter Orszag.

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:36.934
He's the son of--there's a math
professor here,

01:01:36.934 --> 01:01:38.489
Orszag, his father.
 

01:01:38.489 --> 01:01:41.719
So he's a friend of mine,
the son.

01:01:41.719 --> 01:01:45.860
He said once healthcare reform
is in place the U.S.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:48.282
can then focus on other
important things,

01:01:48.282 --> 01:01:50.039
especially Social Security.
 

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:52.855
So Obama wants to do something
about it, but he just doesn't

01:01:52.855 --> 01:01:53.809
want to privatize.
 

01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:56.333
So it's a big problem and
everything everybody says about

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:57.280
it seems plausible.
 

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:00.820
Now, just to continue along the
plausibility of it,

01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:04.360
so Bush says what he really
wants to do is--

01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.221
why private accounts are a
better thing is that if you put

01:02:07.221 --> 01:02:09.429
the money in private accounts it
can grow.

01:02:09.429 --> 01:02:11.871
You can get a greater rate of
return than the current system

01:02:11.871 --> 01:02:12.699
which is terrible.
 

01:02:12.699 --> 01:02:16.835
If you were a young person by
putting your Social Security tax

01:02:16.835 --> 01:02:21.038
money aside in a private account
you'll be able to get a better

01:02:21.038 --> 01:02:24.902
rate of return on your money
than the government could get

01:02:24.902 --> 01:02:26.530
you on your money.
 

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:28.409
So why would you just want to
give it to the government?

01:02:28.409 --> 01:02:31.891
It's for your retirement and
you'll be able to pass that

01:02:31.891 --> 01:02:35.943
money along to your children and
grandchildren if you want at the

01:02:35.943 --> 01:02:36.449
end.
 

01:02:36.449 --> 01:02:39.251
And best of all the money's
yours and the government can't

01:02:39.251 --> 01:02:39.989
take it away.
 

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:43.889
So that's what Bush says and
he's said many times.

01:02:43.889 --> 01:02:46.849
So there's one sense in which
he's right.

01:02:46.849 --> 01:02:51.760
So let's look at the returns
people got on Social Security.

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.280
Now, what is a return?
 

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.809
We know what the rate of return
is.

01:02:54.809 --> 01:02:56.090
How do they calculate it?
 

01:02:56.090 --> 01:03:00.909
You can go back to people born
starting in 1878.

01:03:00.909 --> 01:03:03.047
Social Security,
as you'll see in a second,

01:03:03.047 --> 01:03:05.489
I'm going to give you the
history, began 1939.

01:03:05.489 --> 01:03:12.244
So these people in 1878 they're
60 when Social Security's

01:03:12.244 --> 01:03:16.949
beginning, if my arithmetic is
right.

01:03:16.949 --> 01:03:19.420
So they're 60 at that point.
 

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:22.210
So you can look at all these
people and you can say,

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:25.440
for every generation in the
past, you can say how much money

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.519
did they pay when they were
young?

01:03:27.519 --> 01:03:28.579
They paid taxes.
 

01:03:28.579 --> 01:03:32.460
So they got negative 12.4,
that's the tax rate.

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.652
Negative 12.4,
they did that a bunch of years

01:03:34.652 --> 01:03:37.543
when they were young and then
they started getting payments

01:03:37.543 --> 01:03:42.309
when they were old,
24,24, 20 something like that.

01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:45.619
Those are the payments when
they're old.

01:03:45.619 --> 01:03:47.969
So there are negative ones at
the beginning and positive ones

01:03:47.969 --> 01:03:48.480
at the end.
 

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:51.481
You can calculate the internal
rate of return,

01:03:51.481 --> 01:03:55.150
the yield, the thing that makes
this present value 0.

01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.900
We know how to do that.
 

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:57.070
We've done it.
 

01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.139
So people have done this.
 

01:03:59.139 --> 01:04:02.967
So there's a guy named Limmer,
Limmer or Leemer from the

01:04:02.967 --> 01:04:06.932
Social Security Administration
who did these calculations,

01:04:06.932 --> 01:04:09.159
prompted a little bit by me.
 

01:04:09.159 --> 01:04:12.648
So I should say that a lot of
the reason I got started

01:04:12.648 --> 01:04:16.862
thinking about this is I got put
on a Presidential Panel to study

01:04:16.862 --> 01:04:20.876
Social Security Reform in the
Clinton Administration and every

01:04:20.876 --> 01:04:23.840
Democrat was matched with a
Republican.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:25.534
So the two chairmen,
one Democrat,

01:04:25.534 --> 01:04:27.798
one Republican,
all the way along there was

01:04:27.798 --> 01:04:30.869
Democrat and Republican,
and after Bush got elected all

01:04:30.869 --> 01:04:33.480
the Democrats got kicked off the
committee.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:40.690
But anyway, so in any case here
are the rates of return.

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:43.606
For people who are old when the
program began,

01:04:43.606 --> 01:04:46.782
they got sensational rates of
returns, 40 percent,

01:04:46.782 --> 01:04:49.570
30 percent, incredible rates of
return.

01:04:49.570 --> 01:04:54.036
As the generations get younger
and younger the returns go lower

01:04:54.036 --> 01:04:57.349
and lower and they're down now
to 2 percent.

01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:59.869
These are a forecast of these
rates of returns.

01:04:59.869 --> 01:05:02.463
And so let's see,
you're 20, say,

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:04.329
something on average.
 

01:05:04.329 --> 01:05:08.833
You were born in 1990,
something like that or around

01:05:08.833 --> 01:05:09.539
there.
 

01:05:09.539 --> 01:05:11.530
So here's your rate of return.
 

01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:13.900
It's down here, right?
 

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.719
It's 2 percent,
and there it is blown up.

01:05:16.719 --> 01:05:18.010
It's under 2 percent.
 

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.163
So these are the people from
1924 to 2002,

01:05:20.163 --> 01:05:21.949
so you're right at the end
here.

01:05:21.949 --> 01:05:23.730
That's your rate of return
blown up.

01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:26.599
You can only expect 1 and a
half or 2 percent.

01:05:26.599 --> 01:05:27.929
So George Bush is right.
 

01:05:27.929 --> 01:05:30.710
The rate of return on Social
Security is terrible.

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:34.568
If you look at the taxes that
you put in, and you look at the

01:05:34.568 --> 01:05:38.492
benefits that you can expect to
get your generation is getting

01:05:38.492 --> 01:05:39.780
totally screwed.
 

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.045
So now if you look
historically--this was done in

01:05:43.045 --> 01:05:45.166
1994,
so the number's a little

01:05:45.166 --> 01:05:48.572
bit--it's not quite as dramatic,
but it hasn't changed as much

01:05:48.572 --> 01:05:49.139
as you think.
 

01:05:49.139 --> 01:05:52.559
From money put in the stock
market between '26 and 2004,

01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:56.164
that's before the crash of '29,
so I should have gotten the

01:05:56.164 --> 01:05:58.280
number after the recent crash.
 

01:05:58.280 --> 01:05:59.380
It doesn't change that much.
 

01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:02.420
Before the crash of '29 you
looked at keeping your money in

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.989
the stock market,
just leaving it there for all

01:06:04.989 --> 01:06:07.900
that time,
after inflation you'd get 9.1

01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:09.159
percent return.
 

01:06:09.159 --> 01:06:13.835
On treasury bonds you get 2.7
percent return and yet on Social

01:06:13.835 --> 01:06:17.440
Security you're going to get
under 2 percent.

01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:20.041
So George Bush says,
"Look, put it in the stock

01:06:20.041 --> 01:06:20.500
market.
 

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:21.550
Get 9 percent."
 

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:24.829
We had a little disaster here,
so maybe it's 7 percent.

01:06:24.829 --> 01:06:26.710
"Put it in the stock
market and get 7 percent.

01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:28.750
Why be satisfied with 2 percent?
 

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:29.539
There's something wrong.
 

01:06:29.539 --> 01:06:32.670
We've got to privatize,
put an end to this."

01:06:32.670 --> 01:06:36.099
So there seems to be something
to what he is saying.

01:06:36.099 --> 01:06:39.889
So now you look at what's going
on with Social Security.

01:06:39.889 --> 01:06:41.360
So what happens in Social
Security?

01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:43.980
I'm going to explain the whole
history and how it works here.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:50.210
What happens is you pay taxes,
12.4 percent tax.

01:06:50.210 --> 01:06:51.349
You probably know that.
 

01:06:51.349 --> 01:06:54.228
Everybody's paying taxes on the
money they make and then there

01:06:54.228 --> 01:06:55.880
are benefits that are being
paid.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.713
Now, the benefits are
not--there's a formula for

01:06:58.713 --> 01:07:02.152
benefits which doesn't have
anything to do with the amount

01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:05.186
of taxes being paid,
so at the present time the

01:07:05.186 --> 01:07:07.300
taxes are bigger than the
benefits.

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.849
So where does the extra money
go?

01:07:08.849 --> 01:07:11.260
It goes into the Social
Security Trust Fund.

01:07:11.260 --> 01:07:14.885
So here's the Social Security
Trust Fund which is now around 2

01:07:14.885 --> 01:07:17.293
trillion,
which is going to keep growing

01:07:17.293 --> 01:07:20.851
because contributions are going
to be bigger than benefits until

01:07:20.851 --> 01:07:22.757
2020 or so,
and at that point

01:07:22.757 --> 01:07:25.809
contributions--that's the baby
boom generation,

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:29.849
that's me retiring,
or a little later in my case,

01:07:29.849 --> 01:07:31.889
but anyway the baby boom
generation--

01:07:31.889 --> 01:07:33.650
in fact since I'm a Yale
professor it's out here

01:07:33.650 --> 01:07:34.099
somewhere.
 

01:07:34.099 --> 01:07:39.202
So anyway, my generation's
going to start retiring here and

01:07:39.202 --> 01:07:41.998
then the benefits--
so we're going to be not

01:07:41.998 --> 01:07:44.293
working, not paying taxes but
we're collecting benefits and

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:46.706
there are so many of us that the
benefits are going to be less

01:07:46.706 --> 01:07:49.039
than the taxes and the trust
fund's going to go down,

01:07:49.039 --> 01:07:50.530
and down, and down.
 

01:07:50.530 --> 01:07:53.340
And then the year 2030,
at a little bit more than 2030,

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:57.704
the trust fund's going to go to
0, and then after that the taxes

01:07:57.704 --> 01:08:01.170
are still going to be smaller
than the benefits.

01:08:01.170 --> 01:08:02.230
And so what's going to happen?
 

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:04.367
They'll be no money to pay
these people and there's going

01:08:04.367 --> 01:08:06.429
to have to be a big drop in what
people are getting.

01:08:06.429 --> 01:08:10.052
So it looks like the system is
not only paying a horrible rate

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:12.429
of return, it's not even going
to pay.

01:08:12.429 --> 01:08:15.469
It's going to run out of money
and go broke in 2040.

01:08:15.469 --> 01:08:18.770
So it seems like a total
disaster.

01:08:18.770 --> 01:08:21.060
So that's the setting of the
question.

01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:23.328
George Bush said it's a
disaster.

01:08:23.328 --> 01:08:25.198
It looks, at first glance,
like a disaster.

01:08:25.198 --> 01:08:27.880
The newspapers tell you all the
time it's a disaster.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.779
How did it get to be so bad and
what should we do about it?

01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:35.257
All right, now it's going to
turn out that by using the

01:08:35.257 --> 01:08:38.414
concept of present value it can
be very simple and

01:08:38.414 --> 01:08:42.305
straightforward to understand,
and it's going to be the exact

01:08:42.305 --> 01:08:44.868
opposite of what everybody seems
to be saying.

01:08:44.868 --> 01:08:48.564
So I'm going to play you a clip
next time of Roosevelt

01:08:48.564 --> 01:08:52.886
announcing the Social Security
program and this lady behind him

01:08:52.886 --> 01:08:57.539
is Frances Perkins,
the first woman to ever be in

01:08:57.539 --> 01:09:01.639
the Cabinet,
and she played a tremendous

01:09:01.639 --> 01:09:04.890
role in shaping Social Security.
 

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:09.090
So after Roosevelt started
Social Security in 2004--I'm

01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:12.747
wondering whether I really have
time to do this,

01:09:12.747 --> 01:09:14.770
so I'll just say this.
 

01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:21.250
So Roosevelt started the
program in 1938-'39.

01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:23.948
He started the program in
'38-'39.

01:09:23.948 --> 01:09:28.140
It was one of the cornerstones
of the New Deal.

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.997
It's an incredibly famous
program and it seems to be in

01:09:30.997 --> 01:09:32.109
incredible trouble.
 

01:09:32.109 --> 01:09:35.297
So we need to find out and get
to the bottom of why that is and

01:09:35.297 --> 01:09:37.149
we'll start doing that next
class.

01:09:37.149 --> 01:09:42.000

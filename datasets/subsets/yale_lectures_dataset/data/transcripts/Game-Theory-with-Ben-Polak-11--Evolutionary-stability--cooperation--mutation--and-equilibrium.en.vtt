00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.509
Professor Ben Polak: So
we're going to do a new topic

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:13.490
today, we're going to talk about
evolution.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:21.631
We're going to talk about the
connection between evolution and

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.741
Game Theory.
Now there's going to be an

00:00:24.741 --> 00:00:27.510
extra reading--I've already
emailed you about this--there's

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.710
going to be an extra reading on
this for the people who want it.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.714
I'm going to--There's a reading
packet that's available to

00:00:34.714 --> 00:00:37.223
anybody who wants it.
I emailed you all,

00:00:37.223 --> 00:00:40.250
the website where you can order
that reading packet and figure

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.750
out where to pick it up.
It's not compulsory.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.070
You don't have to look at that
reading packet.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.331
It's just that it might help.
In addition,

00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:49.620
as with last Wednesday,
since some of the material here

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.019
is new,
I have written a handout that

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.723
goes with this lecture and that
handout will appear magically

00:00:55.723 --> 00:00:59.312
this afternoon on the website.
So if things today are fast,

00:00:59.312 --> 00:01:02.030
don't worry there's a handout
that goes with it.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.831
All right, so why look at
evolution in the context of Game

00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:09.250
Theory?
There are really two reasons.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:18.382
The first reason is because of
the influence of Game Theory on

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:21.526
biology.
It turns out that in the last

00:01:21.526 --> 00:01:24.875
few decades, there's been an
enormous amount of work done in

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:27.137
biology,
in particular,

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:33.922
looking at animal behavior and
using Game Theory to analyze

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:38.914
that animal behavior.
And just to give you a loose

00:01:38.914 --> 00:01:42.580
idea about how this works,
the idea is to relate

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.661
strategies with genes,
or at least a phenotype of

00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:51.170
those genes, and to relate
payoffs to genetic fitness.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.853
So the idea is that strategies
are related to genes and the

00:02:00.853 --> 00:02:09.870
payoffs in the games are related
to genetic fitness.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.397
And the big idea of course,
is that strategies grow if they

00:02:15.397 --> 00:02:17.713
do well.
So strategies that do well in

00:02:17.713 --> 00:02:21.080
these games grow.
Strategies that do less well

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.347
die out.
So we're going to be visiting

00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:25.722
that today.
One thing to bear in mind from

00:02:25.722 --> 00:02:29.032
the start is that there's an
important difference between

00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:32.460
Game Theory as analyzed in
animal behavior and biology,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.129
and Game Theory that we've been
doing so far in the class.

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.575
And that is,
that we're going to think of

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:40.509
behaviors, these strategies
played by animals,

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:45.796
not as chosen by reasoning
individuals but rather as being

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:48.756
hardwired.
So if strategies grow it isn't

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:51.710
that some lion or ant has chosen
that strategy.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.878
It's simply that the ant or
lion who has that gene that

00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:58.340
corresponds to that strategy
grows and has many children.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.804
So it's important,
this is a new idea for us,

00:03:02.804 --> 00:03:06.659
that these strategies are
hardwired.

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.860
So it's interesting,
in and of itself,

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.189
but there's also an important
influence the other way.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:18.398
So a second reason for studying
this stuff is that there's been

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:23.806
an enormous influence from
biology or from evolutionary

00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:27.510
biology in particular,
back on the social sciences.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.601
This influence the other way
uses evolution largely as a

00:03:38.601 --> 00:03:41.220
metaphor.
And you'll find this if you're

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.508
a political scientist,
if you're a historian,

00:03:43.508 --> 00:03:46.419
if you're an anthropologist,
if you're a sociologist.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.952
Let me give you an example from
Economics, since it's perhaps

00:03:48.952 --> 00:03:50.599
closer to home.
So here's an example.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.898
You might imagine some firms in
the marketplace and you could

00:03:53.898 --> 00:03:56.866
think of these firms not
necessarily reasoning out what

00:03:56.866 --> 00:03:59.340
is the most profitable strategy
for them,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.099
or what is the most
cost-reducing strategy for them.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:05.568
However, they may just have
rules of thumb to select their

00:04:05.568 --> 00:04:08.189
strategies.
However, in a competitive

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:12.362
marketplace, survival of the
fittest firms will lead to us

00:04:12.362 --> 00:04:17.340
ending up with a bunch firms who
have low costs and high profits.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.283
That make sense?
So here competition in the

00:04:20.283 --> 00:04:24.489
marketplace substitutes for
competition in the jungle,

00:04:24.489 --> 00:04:30.850
as it were.
The analog of a gene dying out

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.466
is a firm going bankrupt.
So this is the kind of ideas

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.372
we're going to explore.
These ideas are going to the

00:04:39.372 --> 00:04:42.531
background for today and Monday.
Now before I go on,

00:04:42.531 --> 00:04:44.879
I want to put in a couple of
kind of important riders.

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.810
So there are two things that I
am not.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.370
The first thing I am not is I'm
not a biologist.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.632
I'm sure there are people in
this room who are biologists who

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:56.839
know a lot more about the
genetic side of this than I do.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.771
So I'm not going to attempt to
teach you biology here,

00:04:59.771 --> 00:05:02.259
I'm going to focus on the Game
Theory part.

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.079
The second thing I'm not is I'm
not an American citizen.

00:05:05.079 --> 00:05:08.415
I worry slightly when we talk
about evolution because I

00:05:08.415 --> 00:05:12.183
realize it's very controversial
here, and some of you might be

00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:15.952
from places like say Kansas.
And if you are from someplace

00:05:15.952 --> 00:05:19.475
like Kansas, then please don't
write to your Senator about

00:05:19.475 --> 00:05:21.733
this,
or if they see the movie,

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:25.543
just tell them it was some
other English guy giving the

00:05:25.543 --> 00:05:28.076
lecture.
So what we're going to actually

00:05:28.076 --> 00:05:31.250
do is we're going to look at a
highly simplified model of

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.167
evolution, at least for today.
We might get onto a more

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.741
complicated model on Monday,
but today it's going to be very

00:05:36.741 --> 00:05:37.570
highly stylized.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.280
So this is going to be our
extremely simplified model.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.075
This simplified model is going
to do tremendous violence to the

00:05:53.075 --> 00:05:56.000
biology, but it's really just to
fix some ideas.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.256
So we're going to focus on what
we're going to call within

00:06:00.256 --> 00:06:01.900
species competition.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.368
So the lions are competing
against the lions and the ants

00:06:09.368 --> 00:06:12.920
are competing against the ants.
The way we're going to think

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.900
about this is we're going to
look at symmetric two-player

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.072
games.
So we look at very simple

00:06:19.072 --> 00:06:22.014
games, they're only going to
involve two players,

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:24.649
and they're going to be
symmetric games,

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:28.666
which means both players have
the same strategies,

00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:31.699
both players have the same
payoffs.

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:34.787
The way we're going to think of
is, we're going to imagine that

00:06:34.787 --> 00:06:36.730
there's a large population out
there,

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:39.683
each of whom is playing a
particular strategy,

00:06:39.683 --> 00:06:42.899
and we're going to assume that
what happens is,

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:47.371
we randomly pick two people
from that population and pair

00:06:47.371 --> 00:06:49.287
them up.
So everyone in this large

00:06:49.287 --> 00:06:51.699
population will be randomly
paired with someone else,

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:54.775
they'll play the strategy that
they are hardwired to play,

00:06:54.775 --> 00:06:56.610
and then we'll see what
happens.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.963
So the idea here is there's a
large population of,

00:07:00.963 --> 00:07:05.139
if you like animals,
which are hardwired to play

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:12.347
particular strategies,
and we're going to have random

00:07:12.347 --> 00:07:15.699
matching.
The idea here is when we do

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:19.394
lots of these random matching,
we're going to keep track of

00:07:19.394 --> 00:07:23.896
the average payoffs.
So what we're going to focus on

00:07:23.896 --> 00:07:28.991
are the average payoffs of
particular strategies when

00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:36.290
randomly matched in these games.
Again, the underlying idea is

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:42.963
that relatively successful
strategies will grow and

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:48.970
relatively unsuccessful ones
will decline,

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.603
I'm not going to write that,
that's obviously the other part

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:52.160
of that.
So relatively successful

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.775
strategies are growing and
relatively unsuccessful

00:07:54.775 --> 00:07:57.345
strategies are declining.
Now to keep things simple,

00:07:57.345 --> 00:07:58.875
I'm not going to do any
dynamics here,

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:01.439
that would take us beyond the
math that you could probably,

00:08:01.439 --> 00:08:02.629
that a lot of you can do in the
class.

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:04.627
So we're not going to worry
about dynamics here,

00:08:04.627 --> 00:08:06.199
but this is the underlying
dynamic.

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:09.901
The idea is that if a strategy
is successful that strategy will

00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:13.005
grow in the population,
if a strategy is unsuccessful

00:08:13.005 --> 00:08:16.291
it will decline.
So this isn't horrible violence

00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:19.193
to biology yet,
it's the next bit that's the

00:08:19.193 --> 00:08:22.723
horrible violence.
So to keep things simple today

00:08:22.723 --> 00:08:26.950
we're going to assume that there
is no gene redistribution.

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:40.951
So in principle what we're
looking at is asexual

00:08:40.951 --> 00:08:45.905
reproduction,
which is clearly not a good

00:08:45.905 --> 00:08:51.788
model but it will do for today.
So you want to think about a

00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:54.055
practical example of asexual
reproduction,

00:08:54.055 --> 00:08:57.262
think about root vegetables or
judging from our experiments

00:08:57.262 --> 00:09:01.266
with the dating game,
we better hope that's true for

00:09:01.266 --> 00:09:04.768
Economics majors as well.
Maybe the fact that I'm

00:09:04.768 --> 00:09:08.327
focusing on asexual reproduction
will get me off with the guys in

00:09:08.327 --> 00:09:11.330
Kansas: maybe I won't lose my
green card after all.

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:15.721
So that's going to be our basic
story, and the basic idea we're

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:18.879
going to use is this.
It's an idea due to a guy

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:22.734
called Maynard Smith in the 70s,
although obviously the big idea

00:09:22.734 --> 00:09:25.149
goes back earlier.
So this is the big idea.

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:29.385
Suppose that we imagine that
there's a particular game and

00:09:29.385 --> 00:09:33.175
there's these large
populations--think of yourselves

00:09:33.175 --> 00:09:36.965
as the large population--and
suppose that the entire

00:09:36.965 --> 00:09:40.830
population were all playing the
same strategy,

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.101
call it S, so they're all
hardwired to play the same

00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:48.673
strategy S.
Suppose now that there's a

00:09:48.673 --> 00:09:53.734
mutation, so some small group
start playing some other

00:09:53.734 --> 00:09:59.065
strategy, let's call it S'.
What we want to ask is will

00:09:59.065 --> 00:10:02.901
that small mutation group,
the S' strategy,

00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:06.279
will it thrive or will it die
out?

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:08.855
If it's true that,
for all possible mutations,

00:10:08.855 --> 00:10:12.231
all the possible little groups
of mutation of people who are

00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:14.139
playing S',
they'll die out,

00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:16.829
then we'll say that the
original strategy,

00:10:16.829 --> 00:10:21.460
the strategy S,
is evolutionarily stable.

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:23.414
We're going to write that out
more formally later on but

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.440
that's just the basic idea,
so let's just say it again.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.479
There's a strategy out there
that everyone's playing,

00:10:27.479 --> 00:10:29.091
call it S.
We're going to look at a

00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:31.432
mutation, that's S'.
So a small group of people are

00:10:31.432 --> 00:10:33.525
going to start playing S'.
They're going to go on being

00:10:33.525 --> 00:10:35.042
randomly matched,
everyone's going to be randomly

00:10:35.042 --> 00:10:37.122
matched,
and we're going to ask if the

00:10:37.122 --> 00:10:39.990
S' group does well,
in which case they'll grow,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.669
or does badly,
in which case they'll shrink

00:10:41.669 --> 00:10:44.979
and eventually die out.
If they die out we'll say that

00:10:44.979 --> 00:10:49.289
S was evolutionarily stable,
that's true for all possible

00:10:49.289 --> 00:10:51.892
mutations.
Just notice when we're randomly

00:10:51.892 --> 00:10:53.960
matching them,
one thing to note is since

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.389
there's only a small mutation to
start with,

00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:58.911
most of the time when they're
randomly matched,

00:10:58.911 --> 00:11:02.419
they're going to match against
somebody who's still playing S.

00:11:02.419 --> 00:11:05.467
Occasionally they're going to
meet one of the other mutants,

00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:08.463
but most of the time we're
going to have to worry about how

00:11:08.463 --> 00:11:11.149
the mutants do against the
incumbent population.

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:13.498
That was too abstract to really
get one's head around,

00:11:13.498 --> 00:11:14.960
so let's try and do an example.

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.651
So let's remove our motivation
and get down to actually doing

00:11:25.651 --> 00:11:26.210
some work.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:33.911
So we're going to start with a
very simple example that you'll

00:11:33.911 --> 00:11:36.851
all recognize.
Here's a game,

00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:44.187
it's a two-by-two game,
and the payoffs are as follows,

00:11:44.187 --> 00:11:48.669
(2,2), (0,3),
(3,0) and (1,1).

00:11:48.669 --> 00:11:55.059
We'll call these strategies
cooperate or defect:

00:11:55.059 --> 00:11:59.409
C for cooperate,
D for defect.

00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:03.190
You'll all recognize
immediately that this game is

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.690
what?
This is Prisoners' Dilemma.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.949
So we're going to start by
imagining these animals playing

00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:10.451
Prisoner's Dilemma.
And to put it into context,

00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:13.393
imagine that these are a group
of lions--and again leave aside

00:12:13.393 --> 00:12:15.515
the fact that it's asexual
reproduction for a

00:12:15.515 --> 00:12:17.830
second--imagine these are a
group of lions.

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:21.084
And cooperating means
cooperating on the hunt,

00:12:21.084 --> 00:12:25.569
it means using a lot of energy
going after--as you cooperate in

00:12:25.569 --> 00:12:29.369
a group while hunting.
And defecting here would mean

00:12:29.369 --> 00:12:33.406
not working hard on the hunt and
letting the other lions catch

00:12:33.406 --> 00:12:36.926
the antelope or whatever,
and then just sharing in the

00:12:36.926 --> 00:12:39.070
spoils: so "free riding"
basically.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.222
Or another example,
think about ants with an ant

00:12:42.222 --> 00:12:46.247
nest, imagine this ant nest has
been attacked by I don't know

00:12:46.247 --> 00:12:50.234
what, some other creature.
You could imagine that

00:12:50.234 --> 00:12:54.543
cooperating is joining in,
in defending the nest,

00:12:54.543 --> 00:12:59.840
at the risk of being hurt and
defecting is running away.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.480
We all know in this game
roughly how to analyze it.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.590
I'm not going to go over that
now.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.600
I want to ask a different
question today.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:13.543
I want to ask in this model of
asexual reproduction is

00:13:13.543 --> 00:13:18.260
cooperation evolutionarily
stable?

00:13:34.289 --> 00:13:36.629
So to try and illustrate that,
let's just think about this

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:38.230
game being played for real out
there.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.573
So what I'm going to do is
we're going to start off by

00:13:40.573 --> 00:13:42.341
imagining that you are all,
I don't know,

00:13:42.341 --> 00:13:44.110
ants, lions,
what do you want to be?

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.462
Ants I think.
So you're, from up here you

00:13:47.462 --> 00:13:50.514
look like ants.
You're all ants and all of you

00:13:50.514 --> 00:13:53.850
have been hardwired to play the
strategy C.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:05.381
So life's going on fine and
let's do some random matching

00:14:05.381 --> 00:14:11.539
here, so suppose that we
randomly match this ant,

00:14:11.539 --> 00:14:16.129
so stand up a second,
so this ant gets randomly

00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:20.419
matched with this ant,
so they now play this

00:14:20.419 --> 00:14:24.710
Prisoner's Dilemma against one
another,

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:29.901
but both of them have been
hardwired to cooperate,

00:14:29.901 --> 00:14:34.140
so they both cooperate,
is that right?

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:37.580
So this ant whose name is?
Student: Lenore.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.199
Professor Ben Polak:
Lenore the ant cooperates and-

00:14:40.199 --> 00:14:42.069
Student: Woo.
Professor Ben Polak: -

00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:44.223
and Woo the ant cooperates.
So since they both cooperate

00:14:44.223 --> 00:14:46.964
there, we can look at what their
payoff is, their payoff is

00:14:46.964 --> 00:14:49.295
cooperate against cooperate,
so they get 2,

00:14:49.295 --> 00:14:52.571
so that's pretty good,
so they're doing pretty well in

00:14:52.571 --> 00:14:56.280
terms of genetic fitness and
suddenly there are two ants,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.494
right?
So this ant produces another

00:14:59.494 --> 00:15:05.428
ant, someone without a computer,
and this ant produces another

00:15:05.428 --> 00:15:07.460
ant,
so they're doing fine and the

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.299
whole population is matching
against other cooperative ants,

00:15:10.299 --> 00:15:13.412
and more ants are being
produced and everything is fine

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:15.430
and dandy, everything looks
good.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.371
Sit down a second.
Now imagine that there's a

00:15:19.371 --> 00:15:23.432
mutation, a small mutation,
and this small mutation

00:15:23.432 --> 00:15:27.900
involves a group of rather nasty
uncooperative ants,

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:31.550
so a scary mutation.
So here's our scary mutation.

00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:33.802
Let's use the T.A.'s.
So the T.A.'s are my scary

00:15:33.802 --> 00:15:36.692
mutations, so all of the T.A.'s
here are the scary mutations,

00:15:36.692 --> 00:15:39.475
there's another one over there.
So there's a bunch,

00:15:39.475 --> 00:15:42.971
everyone else is still playing
cooperate, there's this vast

00:15:42.971 --> 00:15:46.369
number of cooperative ants,
but now there's these small

00:15:46.369 --> 00:15:49.194
number of ants with this
mutation that says don't

00:15:49.194 --> 00:15:51.659
cooperate,
play D.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:53.629
So let's see what happens with
random matching.

00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:56.187
So a lot of these cooperative
ants are still matching with

00:15:56.187 --> 00:15:58.610
each other and doing fine,
but that's not the point.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.824
What we're worried about is
what's going to happen to the

00:16:00.824 --> 00:16:02.524
mutants?
So let's pick our

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:06.820
representative nasty mutant,
so that's going to be Rahul,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.270
so Rahul is our scary mutant
and let's go back and randomly

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:15.029
match him against one of our
incumbent ants,

00:16:15.029 --> 00:16:18.690
our nice, cooperative ants,
so let's pick this one.

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.536
So it just happens that he's
randomly matched with this

00:16:22.536 --> 00:16:25.457
cooperative ant,
and this cooperative ant,

00:16:25.457 --> 00:16:27.190
whose name is?
Student: Nick.

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.644
Professor Ben Polak:
Nick is hardwired since he's a

00:16:29.644 --> 00:16:31.539
regular ant he's hardwired to
play cooperate,

00:16:31.539 --> 00:16:33.090
so he's going to play
cooperate.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.394
Say cooperate,
I should have brought a mic but

00:16:36.394 --> 00:16:39.992
never mind, and meanwhile do you
have a mic handy,

00:16:39.992 --> 00:16:42.358
thank you.
All right, so he says cooperate

00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:44.603
but unfortunately he's been
matched against the nasty

00:16:44.603 --> 00:16:46.817
uncooperative ant.
It's not that he's nasty he's

00:16:46.817 --> 00:16:48.870
just been hardwired to say?
Student: Not cooperate.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.170
Professor Ben Polak: Not
cooperate, to say defect.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:55.449
So what's going to happen now?
So unfortunately for Nick he,

00:16:55.449 --> 00:16:59.724
the cooperative ant,
was matched against a not very

00:16:59.724 --> 00:17:02.894
nice ant,
he was playing C and Rahul was

00:17:02.894 --> 00:17:07.184
playing D, so Nick's payoff is
0, so we went from one Nick to

00:17:07.184 --> 00:17:11.190
being no Nick,
he got wiped out.

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:14.090
Rahul meanwhile,
he got a payoff of what?

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:17.735
What was Rahul's payoff?
Rahul's payoff is 3,

00:17:17.735 --> 00:17:22.369
so suddenly there's not just
Rahul but there's,

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:26.441
the mutation is growing.
Now, we go on matching,

00:17:26.441 --> 00:17:29.614
each period some of you are
going to be matched against

00:17:29.614 --> 00:17:33.140
other cooperative ants and
you're going to be doing fine,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.686
but every now and then,
actually increasingly often,

00:17:35.686 --> 00:17:38.482
you're going to be matched
against one of our mutants and

00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:41.135
those mutants are going to grow,
those mutants are going to go

00:17:41.135 --> 00:17:42.944
on growing.
Now it's true that every now

00:17:42.944 --> 00:17:45.437
and then a mutant's going to
meet another mutant,

00:17:45.437 --> 00:17:47.912
is that right?
But we don't have to worry

00:17:47.912 --> 00:17:51.770
about that, all we have to worry
about is, are they going to die

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:54.119
out early on?
It's going to be very rare for

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:56.309
them to meet another mutant,
at least early on.

00:17:56.309 --> 00:18:00.503
So the strategy cooperate is
evolutionarily stable if this

00:18:00.503 --> 00:18:03.740
small mutation,
here's our small mutation,

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:07.809
disappears and doesn't turn
into a bigger mutation.

00:18:07.809 --> 00:18:10.218
Of course in this case,
as we just saw,

00:18:10.218 --> 00:18:13.259
the mutation didn't die out,
it actually grew.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:16.004
So to be formal about this,
let me be careful,

00:18:16.004 --> 00:18:19.664
for the strategy cooperate to
be evolutionary stable it needs

00:18:19.664 --> 00:18:23.690
to be the case that the mutation
actually dies out on average,

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.920
and here far from dying out,
it grew.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.880
We now have lots of these nasty
T.A.'s.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.590
People understand?
All right, so let's just,

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.857
thanks.
So let's just try and do that a

00:18:34.857 --> 00:18:38.339
little bit more formally on the
board.

00:18:38.339 --> 00:18:42.065
That was the basic idea,
and the graphics of the idea,

00:18:42.065 --> 00:18:45.579
but let's look at it a little
bit more formally.

00:18:45.579 --> 00:18:49.155
So we basically have
cooperative ants and a few

00:18:49.155 --> 00:18:54.026
mutant defecter ants out there,
so mutant not-cooperative ants,

00:18:54.026 --> 00:18:58.640
and what we want to keep track
of, are their average payoffs in

00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.247
random matches.
So the incumbent ant,

00:19:01.247 --> 00:19:03.480
the cooperative ants,
they're playing,

00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:06.679
we're interested in their
payoff and they're playing a

00:19:06.679 --> 00:19:09.921
population that's mixed.
Almost everybody in the

00:19:09.921 --> 00:19:13.097
population is cooperative,
so let's say 1 - ε

00:19:13.097 --> 00:19:16.338
of the people they're playing
against (where ε

00:19:16.338 --> 00:19:20.480
is a small number,
a very small number) are also

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:26.329
cooperative, but every now and
then, like our poor friend Nick,

00:19:26.329 --> 00:19:29.302
they're going to come across a
nasty mutant,

00:19:29.302 --> 00:19:31.859
they're going to come across
Rahul.

00:19:31.859 --> 00:19:34.778
So what's their payoff going to
be on average,

00:19:34.778 --> 00:19:37.351
their average payoff?
So 1 - ε

00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:40.762
of the time,
we can actually think of this

00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:44.339
mix here, so it's 1 - ε
and ε.

00:19:44.339 --> 00:19:49.524
1 - ε of the time they're
going to meet another

00:19:49.524 --> 00:19:53.589
cooperative ant and get a payoff
of 2,

00:19:53.589 --> 00:19:59.554
but ε of the time they're
going to meet Rahul and get a

00:19:59.554 --> 00:20:02.040
payoff of 0.
Is that correct?

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.573
So that's their average payoff.
Now how about the mutants'

00:20:05.573 --> 00:20:06.998
payoffs?
So the mutants,

00:20:06.998 --> 00:20:09.794
there aren't many of them
around, but they are also

00:20:09.794 --> 00:20:12.309
playing against the same mixed
population,

00:20:12.309 --> 00:20:16.241
1 - ε of the time they're
going to be matched against a

00:20:16.241 --> 00:20:20.039
cooperative ant and ε
of the time the two mutants,

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:24.130
the two T.A.'s are going to
playoff against each other.

00:20:24.130 --> 00:20:25.849
Let's have a look at what their
payoff is.

00:20:25.849 --> 00:20:30.519
So their payoff is 1 - ε,
they get a payoff of 3,

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:35.630
that's what we saw when Rahul
met Nick and the other ε

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:39.472
of the time,
Rahul meets Jake or somebody

00:20:39.472 --> 00:20:42.859
and has to make do with a payoff
of 1.

00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:45.529
But if we keep track of this,
what do we have?

00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:52.772
This equals 2(1--ε) and
this equals 3(1--ε) +

00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:56.140
ε.
Is that right?

00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:00.708
Clearly, I hope this is clear,
the payoff to the mutant is

00:21:00.708 --> 00:21:02.039
bigger.
Everyone happy with that?

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:06.293
The payoff to the mutant is
bigger which means the mutation

00:21:06.293 --> 00:21:09.670
is not going to die out.
In fact it's going to grow.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:16.079
Mutation's not going to die out.
So we can conclude that C is

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:22.432
not evolutionarily stable.
I'm going to start using ES for

00:21:22.432 --> 00:21:23.540
evolutionarily stable.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:32.339
So in this particular game
cooperation is not ES.

00:21:32.339 --> 00:21:37.769
So we might ask what is ES in
this game?

00:21:37.769 --> 00:21:40.064
Well that's not going to be
hard to figure it out,

00:21:40.064 --> 00:21:43.234
since there is only one choice.
I claim that D is going to be

00:21:43.234 --> 00:21:44.860
ES, but let's just prove it.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.694
So is it going to be the case
that these mutants will

00:21:56.694 --> 00:22:01.207
eventually take over the whole
population and everyone will end

00:22:01.207 --> 00:22:05.619
up looking like a T.A.
and being uncooperative?

00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:07.700
So they're busily asexually
reproducing all the time,

00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:11.122
they get bigger and bigger,
and isn't it in fact the case

00:22:11.122 --> 00:22:15.490
that once they've conquered
everything that they're ES?

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:22.548
So is defect ES in this game?
To figure that out we have to

00:22:22.548 --> 00:22:24.549
do exactly the reverse
experiment.

00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:28.035
So the experiment now is
imagine everyone in the

00:22:28.035 --> 00:22:33.963
population, all of you guys,
all of the students in the room

00:22:33.963 --> 00:22:38.980
are nasty non-cooperative
defecting ants.

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.208
You're going along and most of
the time you're meeting,

00:22:41.208 --> 00:22:43.767
your meeting each other all the
time for now and you're getting

00:22:43.767 --> 00:22:46.490
a payoff of 1.
And now there's a mutation,

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:50.670
but this time the mutation
isn't the scary non-cooperative

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:53.750
mutation that we saw before with
Rahul,

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:56.210
it's going to be Myrto over
there.

00:22:56.210 --> 00:23:00.430
And Myrto is a nice mutation
who cooperates.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.099
So Myrto's our nice,
cooperative mutation.

00:23:03.099 --> 00:23:05.339
Let me just get the camera to
pan on poor little Myrto.

00:23:05.339 --> 00:23:08.217
So there is poor little Myrto
who is the only cooperative

00:23:08.217 --> 00:23:13.089
mutation in the room.
Wave, there we go okay, right.

00:23:13.089 --> 00:23:16.329
What's going to happen to our
cooperative mutation?

00:23:16.329 --> 00:23:18.230
So most of the time you
non-cooperative people are

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.970
matching up against each other.
We're going to figure out what

00:23:20.970 --> 00:23:24.159
your payoff is.
So that the uncooperative

00:23:24.159 --> 00:23:29.749
incumbents, they're playing a
population that is 1 - ε

00:23:29.749 --> 00:23:35.340
non-cooperative and ε
of the time they meet Myrto.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.896
So what's their average payoffs?
Let's be careful,

00:23:37.896 --> 00:23:41.878
let's switch things around up
here just to make sure we can

00:23:41.878 --> 00:23:45.457
see what happened.
So switching things around on

00:23:45.457 --> 00:23:48.921
our chart up here,
we're now looking at the case

00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:52.606
where there's 1 - ε
non-cooperators and ε

00:23:52.606 --> 00:23:53.860
cooperators.

00:24:01.769 --> 00:24:04.686
So you guys,
you non-cooperative ants are

00:24:04.686 --> 00:24:08.916
most of the time meeting each
other, and when you meet each

00:24:08.916 --> 00:24:11.759
other you're getting a payoff of
1.

00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:14.539
So 1 - ε
of the time you're getting a

00:24:14.539 --> 00:24:18.132
payoff of 1, but ε
of the time you're doing great

00:24:18.132 --> 00:24:22.241
because you're meeting Myrto,
and unfortunately you're

00:24:22.241 --> 00:24:25.440
beating up on Myrto.
How is she doing?

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.803
Well she's a cooperator and 1 -
ε of the time she's meeting

00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:34.890
you guys and ε
of the time she meets another

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:40.362
nice cooperative ant like Jake.
So her payoff is 1 - ε

00:24:40.362 --> 00:24:45.810
of the time she gets nothing
and ε of the time she does

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:49.780
pretty well and gets 2,
but it's only ε

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.050
of the time.
Is that right?

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.073
So far, so good.
So what's going to happen to

00:24:55.073 --> 00:24:59.623
this mutation?
Well the incumbent population,

00:24:59.623 --> 00:25:05.962
their average payoff comes down
to being 1 - ε

00:25:05.962 --> 00:25:12.681
+ 3ε and Myrto's payoff,
the mutant ends up being

00:25:12.681 --> 00:25:15.996
2ε.
So unfortunately,

00:25:15.996 --> 00:25:21.288
these nasty ants are thriving
and Myrto gets wiped out,

00:25:21.288 --> 00:25:25.519
so she can sit down again.
So what have we shown here?

00:25:25.519 --> 00:25:30.284
We've shown that defect,
not cooperate,

00:25:30.284 --> 00:25:35.299
is evolutionarily stable in
this game.

00:25:35.299 --> 00:25:37.891
Any mutation,
there's only one possible

00:25:37.891 --> 00:25:40.619
mutation, any mutation gets
wiped out.

00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:42.910
Think about these two different
models here.

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:46.331
The first, well not different
models but different metaphors,

00:25:46.331 --> 00:25:49.525
so we started out with this
population of relatively nice

00:25:49.525 --> 00:25:51.750
people and we had a nasty
mutation,

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:55.333
so think of the movie Alien,
actually don't because it's a

00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:57.785
horrible movie,
but all right and if you

00:25:57.785 --> 00:26:00.895
remember that horrible movie,
Alien or Species,

00:26:00.895 --> 00:26:03.880
think of the movie Species,
an even worse movie.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.259
Think of the movie Species.
That was Rahul and he grew

00:26:07.259 --> 00:26:09.880
albeit asexually,
very rapidly.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.160
That's a pretty scary movie,
right?

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:15.451
Conversely, when we had this
population of nasty people and

00:26:15.451 --> 00:26:18.799
we tried to have a nice little
invasion of a nice mutant,

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:23.237
so think of the movie ET,
unfortunately,

00:26:23.237 --> 00:26:28.130
ET got squished,
that's the two extremes.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:34.190
So what is the lesson that we
can actually draw from this?

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.917
So there's a lesson here and
the lesson--I guess there's

00:26:38.917 --> 00:26:43.730
going to be two lessons here but
let's start with one.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:47.594
The first lesson here is
that,--well let's just put it on

00:26:47.594 --> 00:26:53.068
the board first of all.
Nature, the outcome of

00:26:53.068 --> 00:26:58.009
evolution, nature,
can suck.

00:26:58.009 --> 00:27:00.761
So again we could use a more
formal term but this is an

00:27:00.761 --> 00:27:03.491
important lesson.
There's a tendency for some

00:27:03.491 --> 00:27:06.362
people to think that if
something arises as a

00:27:06.362 --> 00:27:09.402
consequence of evolution,
if something is natural,

00:27:09.402 --> 00:27:12.130
if something is in nature,
it must therefore be good in

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.039
some moral way,
efficient or something.

00:27:15.039 --> 00:27:19.519
What we're seeing here is in
this game the consequence of

00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:22.319
nature is a horrible
consequence.

00:27:22.319 --> 00:27:25.090
For those people who doubt that
nature can be pretty unpleasant

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:27.503
have a look at yesterday's
science page of The New York

00:27:27.503 --> 00:27:29.783
Times,
and read the piece about how

00:27:29.783 --> 00:27:32.730
the baboons basically kill the
baby baboons.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.395
The biggest cause of death
among baby baboons is

00:27:35.395 --> 00:27:37.386
infanticide.
This is ES it turns out and

00:27:37.386 --> 00:27:41.160
they explain why in The Times.
It isn't pleasant.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.507
So nature can suck,
nature can be pretty

00:27:43.507 --> 00:27:45.803
inefficient.
Now, this raises a question in

00:27:45.803 --> 00:27:48.662
this particular game because
look at the examples we started

00:27:48.662 --> 00:27:50.533
with.
We started with lions who are

00:27:50.533 --> 00:27:52.783
thinking about--or not thinking
about, sorry,

00:27:52.783 --> 00:27:55.494
they weren't thinking
about--they were hardwired to go

00:27:55.494 --> 00:27:57.950
after antelope and either
cooperate or not.

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:02.236
And we talked about ants who
are hardwired to defend the nest

00:28:02.236 --> 00:28:04.326
or not.
We all know from watching

00:28:04.326 --> 00:28:07.797
endless nature shows as children
on TV that actually lions do

00:28:07.797 --> 00:28:10.170
cooperate when they go after
antelope,

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:13.722
and actually ants do defend the
nest when it's invaded by a

00:28:13.722 --> 00:28:16.200
spider or something.
Is that right?

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.400
Looking for some nodding,
is that right?

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.430
Yeah okay, good.
So what happened?

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:22.759
What's wrong with our model
here?

00:28:22.759 --> 00:28:24.987
We've argued here that,
in this model,

00:28:24.987 --> 00:28:28.480
nature's going to produce this
non-cooperative behavior.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.946
We know there are examples of
cooperation in nature,

00:28:31.946 --> 00:28:34.740
what's going on?
What are we missing?

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:39.340
Can I get a mike in here.
It's here.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:42.240
Let me do it.
I'll do it.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.014
Yeah, so what's going on?
Student: Different

00:28:45.014 --> 00:28:47.135
communities might compete
against each other,

00:28:47.135 --> 00:28:50.026
so one community that doesn't
have any of these mutations and

00:28:50.026 --> 00:28:53.314
stays cooperative might succeed,
so communities in general don't

00:28:53.314 --> 00:28:55.467
have as many mutations.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:56.819
Okay, so that's an interesting
idea.

00:28:56.819 --> 00:28:59.531
So part of this is because
we're focusing on within species

00:28:59.531 --> 00:29:02.150
competition rather than the
cross-species competition.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:04.833
That turned out to be a
complicated idea and large

00:29:04.833 --> 00:29:07.900
literature on it and it's
actually a little difficult.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.580
I was looking for,
but it's a good suggestion,

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:13.201
I was looking for something
simpler actually,

00:29:13.201 --> 00:29:15.928
let me come back here.
Student: Do these

00:29:15.928 --> 00:29:18.579
species have ways to detect
cheaters and punish them?

00:29:18.579 --> 00:29:20.576
Professor Ben Polak:
Okay, that might be a

00:29:20.576 --> 00:29:23.195
possibility and certainly there
is some evidence of that but not

00:29:23.195 --> 00:29:24.938
much.
Again, we're looking at pretty

00:29:24.938 --> 00:29:26.900
high primates by the time you
get to that.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.411
Something simpler,
something you should all have

00:29:29.411 --> 00:29:32.349
on your mind all the time if
you're normal teenagers.

00:29:32.349 --> 00:29:35.018
Student: The payoffs
could change as the proportion

00:29:35.018 --> 00:29:37.453
of cheaters increases,
so you're not going to get the

00:29:37.453 --> 00:29:39.279
payoff of 3 if everyone's
cheating.

00:29:39.279 --> 00:29:40.853
Professor Ben Polak: All
right, but okay,

00:29:40.853 --> 00:29:43.029
it's true that you're going to
get a different expected payoff,

00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:44.019
but that isn't the payoff of
the game.

00:29:44.019 --> 00:29:45.950
I'm looking for something
really simple that,

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:47.880
let me repeat,
I'm guessing is on all of your

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.384
minds as teenagers.
Let's see if that hint's going

00:29:50.384 --> 00:29:53.319
to get the right answer.
Yeah.

00:29:53.319 --> 00:29:54.460
Student: Answer,
not asexual.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.476
Professor Ben Polak:
Right, the assumption that's

00:29:57.476 --> 00:30:00.327
really driving this here is the
assumption of asexual

00:30:00.327 --> 00:30:02.491
reproduction.
Sexual reproduction with gene

00:30:02.491 --> 00:30:04.190
exchange is going to make a
difference.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.712
Why?
I don't want to delve too much

00:30:06.712 --> 00:30:09.221
into the biology here,
but the main why is,

00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:11.849
what matters is the survival of
the gene,

00:30:11.849 --> 00:30:15.319
not survival of the individual
ant or individual lion.

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:18.415
So if you have sexual
reproduction you get gene

00:30:18.415 --> 00:30:22.519
redistribution among children
and cousins to a less extent,

00:30:22.519 --> 00:30:26.024
so provided the other ants in
the nest are closely enough

00:30:26.024 --> 00:30:29.415
genetically related to you,
and provided the lions are

00:30:29.415 --> 00:30:32.869
close enough related to you,
then it may turn out to be,

00:30:32.869 --> 00:30:35.324
it may turn out that you will
cooperate, and that in fact,

00:30:35.324 --> 00:30:36.960
does change the payoffs of the
game.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.449
It doesn't change the payoffs
for the individual lion or ant,

00:30:40.449 --> 00:30:42.660
it changes the payoffs for the
gene.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.198
Now if we have time we'll come
back and look at that on Monday,

00:30:45.198 --> 00:30:47.956
and even if we don't have time,
in the reading I've left for

00:30:47.956 --> 00:30:50.517
you in the reading packet,
it goes into that in some

00:30:50.517 --> 00:30:52.123
detail.
It's a much more complicated

00:30:52.123 --> 00:30:53.700
model but that's what we're
going to get,

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.065
for the most part that's where
we're going to get cooperation

00:30:56.065 --> 00:30:58.470
from rather than from the other
points that people made.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.049
So sex can make a difference
here, but we're going to stick

00:31:01.049 --> 00:31:03.494
with asexual reproduction
because it's easier to analyze

00:31:03.494 --> 00:31:05.140
and stick with it for the
minute.

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.359
And we've learned,
the second lesson we've learned

00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:09.579
here, I'm going to generalize
from this lesson,

00:31:09.579 --> 00:31:14.316
we learned that a strategy that
was strictly dominated was not

00:31:14.316 --> 00:31:18.091
evolutionarily stable.
I've only shown an example here

00:31:18.091 --> 00:31:20.250
but we'll extend from the
example.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:30.815
So if a strategy is strictly
dominated, and of course

00:31:30.815 --> 00:31:38.740
cooperate is strictly dominated
here,

00:31:38.740 --> 00:31:43.658
then it is not evolutionarily
stable, at least in this simple

00:31:43.658 --> 00:31:46.609
game of just asexual
reproduction.

00:31:46.609 --> 00:31:49.706
Even though I haven't proved
this here, the idea is exactly

00:31:49.706 --> 00:31:52.589
the idea of this example,
so let's just try and talk it

00:31:52.589 --> 00:31:55.627
through.
Suppose a strategy was strictly

00:31:55.627 --> 00:32:00.034
dominated, how do we know,
how can we see that it will not

00:32:00.034 --> 00:32:03.490
be evolutionarily stable?
Somebody?

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:08.730
Where are my pre-med majors?
Where are my pre-med people?

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.419
They're all hiding now.
I know you're out there because

00:32:11.419 --> 00:32:13.049
I've seen your forms,
but never mind.

00:32:13.049 --> 00:32:21.380
Why is this dominated strategy
not evolutionarily stable?

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.651
Student: The strategy
that dominates it will be a

00:32:23.651 --> 00:32:25.780
successful mutation.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.221
Good, so the strategy that
dominates, the strategy that

00:32:28.221 --> 00:32:30.662
does the domination of this
strictly dominated strategy

00:32:30.662 --> 00:32:33.797
would be a successful mutation.
If it enters it does well,

00:32:33.797 --> 00:32:37.216
not just against this strategy
but against any mix involving

00:32:37.216 --> 00:32:42.148
itself and this strategy.
So the strictly dominator

00:32:42.148 --> 00:32:47.192
strategy will invade.
So we can't have strictly

00:32:47.192 --> 00:32:51.030
dominated strategies surviving
in evolution.

00:32:56.049 --> 00:33:01.127
Let's do another example and
we'll see if we can learn some

00:33:01.127 --> 00:33:04.921
more.
So this is going to be a

00:33:04.921 --> 00:33:09.559
slightly more complicated
example.

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:12.884
Let's have a three-by-three
game, so here's our

00:33:12.884 --> 00:33:17.220
three-by-three game and we'll
just label the strategies A,

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.638
B, C and A, B,
C and once again we're going to

00:33:19.638 --> 00:33:22.647
focus on symmetric games,
so this game will be symmetric:

00:33:22.647 --> 00:33:26.617
2,
2,0, 0,0, 0,0,

00:33:26.617 --> 00:33:38.080
0, lots of zeros in this,
1,1, 0,0,1,1,0,0.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:45.769
So this is a symmetric game.
We'll look at this game a

00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:50.395
little bit, I don't want to look
at all of it,

00:33:50.395 --> 00:33:55.946
I want to ask the question is
strategy C evolutionarily

00:33:55.946 --> 00:33:58.650
stable?
Let's go back to our experiment.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:03.588
What does it involve?
Imagine everyone in the room is

00:34:03.588 --> 00:34:09.022
hardwired to play C,
could that population be

00:34:09.022 --> 00:34:13.660
invaded by a mutation?
So what do we think?

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.170
Is C evolutionarily stable?
Who thinks it is stable?

00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:20.443
Who thinks it's not stable?
So most of you think it's not

00:34:20.443 --> 00:34:22.130
stable so you must have some
idea why.

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:25.552
Why do we think it's not stable?
Let me just try and cold call a

00:34:25.552 --> 00:34:28.710
little bit.
Anybody?

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:32.273
Let me sample somebody.
If it's not stable it must be

00:34:32.273 --> 00:34:34.519
it's going to get invaded,
so who's going to invade it?

00:34:34.519 --> 00:34:39.267
Can we try this gentleman here,
have a guess who's going to

00:34:39.267 --> 00:34:41.210
invade it?
Student: Strategy B.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:42.900
Professor Ben Polak:
Strategy B, okay that's correct.

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.639
Your name is?
Student: Greg.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.212
Professor Ben Polak: So
Greg is saying strategy B might

00:34:48.212 --> 00:34:51.550
invade here, let's have a look,
let's see what happens.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:56.950
So suppose there's an invasion
of B, so again the T.A.'s are

00:34:56.950 --> 00:35:01.985
playing B, everyone else is
playing C, and let's see how

00:35:01.985 --> 00:35:07.041
these incumbent genes do.
So C is playing against 1 -

00:35:07.041 --> 00:35:11.666
ε of the population who are
playing C and ε

00:35:11.666 --> 00:35:15.579
who are playing B and its
average payoff?

00:35:15.579 --> 00:35:19.921
Well 1 - ε
of the time it'll be matched

00:35:19.921 --> 00:35:25.070
against essentially itself and
get a payoff of 0,

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:33.896
but ε of the time it will
be matched against a B and get a

00:35:33.896 --> 00:35:38.110
payoff of 1.
Everyone agree with that?

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.404
So 1 - ε
of the time it meets itself and

00:35:40.404 --> 00:35:42.437
gets nothing,
ε of the time it gets

00:35:42.437 --> 00:35:45.849
lucky and it meets a T.A.
and gets a payoff of 1.

00:35:45.849 --> 00:35:49.960
How about those B invaders,
the T.A.'s in the class.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:52.737
So 1 - ε
of the time they're going to

00:35:52.737 --> 00:35:55.922
meet C's and ε
of the time they're going to

00:35:55.922 --> 00:35:59.309
meet B's and 1 - ε
of the time therefore,

00:35:59.309 --> 00:36:03.618
the B is meeting a C and
getting a payoff of 1,

00:36:03.618 --> 00:36:06.990
so 1 - ε
of the time the T.A.

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:11.772
is meeting one of you.
And ε of the time the T.A.

00:36:11.772 --> 00:36:16.076
is meeting another T.A.,
playing B against B,

00:36:16.076 --> 00:36:21.418
and getting 0.
So this works out as ε

00:36:21.418 --> 00:36:26.050
and this works out as 1 -
ε.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:30.114
But notice that if ε
is small, if there were just a

00:36:30.114 --> 00:36:34.327
small number of these mutations,
1 - ε is bigger than

00:36:34.327 --> 00:36:36.289
ε.
Is that right?

00:36:36.289 --> 00:36:39.248
So that means that this
mutation will not die out,

00:36:39.248 --> 00:36:42.570
it'll probably go on,
we can actually say a bit more,

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:46.331
it'll probably go on growing
until it's roughly half the

00:36:46.331 --> 00:36:48.390
population.
But, in particular,

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:51.670
it won't die out.
Since it won't die out,

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:57.333
since the mutation doesn't die
out, we can conclude that C is

00:36:57.333 --> 00:37:03.179
not evolutionarily stable.
Everyone okay with that idea?

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:04.893
Now this idea,
this example is a little bit

00:37:04.893 --> 00:37:06.730
more complicated than the
previous example,

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:11.653
because it turns out that the
invading mutant population,

00:37:11.653 --> 00:37:16.490
the population B is itself not
evolutionarily stable.

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:19.809
Everyone see that?
C wasn't evolutionarily stable

00:37:19.809 --> 00:37:28.190
because it got invaded by B.
Who's going to invade B?

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:30.570
C is going to invade B,
turns out everything is exactly

00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:32.861
symmetric here.
So even though we're arguing

00:37:32.861 --> 00:37:36.054
that C is not evolutionarily
stable because it's invaded by

00:37:36.054 --> 00:37:38.806
B,
it doesn't have to be the case

00:37:38.806 --> 00:37:43.760
that the successful mutant is
itself evolutionarily stable.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:52.750
So in this particular example
the invader, namely B,

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:59.449
is itself not evolutionarily
stable.

00:37:59.449 --> 00:38:03.173
Nevertheless,
it doesn't die out but it

00:38:03.173 --> 00:38:08.217
invades the population of C's.
But there's a second

00:38:08.217 --> 00:38:13.938
observation I want to draw off
this one, hoping there's a bit

00:38:13.938 --> 00:38:16.472
of chalk here,
not finding it,

00:38:16.472 --> 00:38:19.391
there's a second observation I
want to draw here,

00:38:19.391 --> 00:38:23.746
what do we observe?
What else is true about both C

00:38:23.746 --> 00:38:27.574
and B?
So what's true about everyone

00:38:27.574 --> 00:38:31.760
playing C or everyone playing B?
What else?

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:35.842
Just going back to what we've
learned in the course so far,

00:38:35.842 --> 00:38:38.940
what do we think about everyone
playing C?

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.757
So if we had everyone playing C
we'd be looking at an object

00:38:43.757 --> 00:38:48.820
like this (C,C) and we might ask
the question is (C,C) what?

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:59.010
Is it a Nash Equilibrium?
Is (C,C) a Nash Equilibrium?

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:01.383
Here we asked was it
evolutionarily stable,

00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:04.030
we found it wasn't.
Let's ask a different question,

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:05.680
and forget evolution for a
second.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:11.940
Is (C,C) a Nash Equilibrium?
Well that's a question you all

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:16.316
should be able to answer for the
mid-term so somebody tell me the

00:39:16.316 --> 00:39:18.454
answer.
It's not a Nash Equilibrium,

00:39:18.454 --> 00:39:20.739
how do we know it's not a Nash
Equilibrium?

00:39:20.739 --> 00:39:24.420
What do we have to do to show
it's not a Nash Equilibrium?

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:27.151
We have to show that there's a
profitable deviation,

00:39:27.151 --> 00:39:28.339
right.
So what's the,

00:39:28.339 --> 00:39:30.726
shout it out,
what's the profitable deviation

00:39:30.726 --> 00:39:33.130
here?
Profitable deviation is B.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:52.409
It's not no because B is a
strictly profitable deviation.

00:39:52.409 --> 00:39:55.871
Notice that the thing that was
a strictly profitable deviation

00:39:55.871 --> 00:39:59.219
was the same thing that would
have invaded the population of

00:39:59.219 --> 00:40:02.568
C's in the context of our ant's
nest and the context of this

00:40:02.568 --> 00:40:06.030
classroom being an ant's nest
and looking at evolution.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:09.039
Is that right?
So what have we just learned

00:40:09.039 --> 00:40:11.483
here?
Well this idea turns out to be

00:40:11.483 --> 00:40:17.294
general.
The idea is if a strategy S,

00:40:17.294 --> 00:40:27.950
perhaps I should make this a
lesson, if a strategy S is not

00:40:27.950 --> 00:40:36.668
Nash,
so in other words (S,S) is not

00:40:36.668 --> 00:40:48.023
a Nash Equilibrium,
then S is not evolutionarily

00:40:48.023 --> 00:40:52.300
stable.
If S is not Nash,

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:56.349
then S is not evolutionarily
stable.

00:40:56.349 --> 00:40:59.048
Now with a little bit of logic,
can we flip that around and we

00:40:59.048 --> 00:41:00.949
will say, what that actually
tells us is,

00:41:00.949 --> 00:41:09.621
it's equivalent to saying,
if S is evolutionarily stable

00:41:09.621 --> 00:41:15.139
then (S,S) is a Nash
Equilibrium,

00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:17.850
that's the equivalent way of
saying that.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.303
So what's the idea here?
Let's look at the first line

00:41:20.303 --> 00:41:22.293
rather than the second line,
because it's pretty easy to

00:41:22.293 --> 00:41:24.112
understand.
The idea here is,

00:41:24.112 --> 00:41:27.585
if a strategy is not Nash,
what that means is,

00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:31.754
is there's some other strategy
that would be a strictly

00:41:31.754 --> 00:41:36.539
profitable deviation and that's
enough to tell us that S cannot

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:39.659
be evolutionarily stable.
Why?

00:41:39.659 --> 00:41:44.060
Because take that same strategy
that was a strictly profitable

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:47.621
deviation, B in this case,
and that strategy can be

00:41:47.621 --> 00:41:50.961
thought of as the mutation
that's going to invade the

00:41:50.961 --> 00:41:54.300
strategy we started from.
Everyone see that?

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.703
Say it once more.
Suppose a strategy isn't,

00:41:56.703 --> 00:42:00.190
suppose strategy (S,S) is not a
Nash Equilibrium.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:03.907
What that means is some other
strategy S' say that is a

00:42:03.907 --> 00:42:07.815
strictly profitable deviation.
Now think about strictly

00:42:07.815 --> 00:42:10.943
profitable deviation S' as a
mutant invasion,

00:42:10.943 --> 00:42:14.639
so now Rahul is playing,
is hardwired to play S'.

00:42:14.639 --> 00:42:17.824
Since it was strictly
profitable it's going to be,

00:42:17.824 --> 00:42:20.880
since it was strictly
profitable as a deviation,

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.869
it's going to be successful as
an invader.

00:42:23.869 --> 00:42:30.221
So again I haven't formally
proved it, but that's exactly

00:42:30.221 --> 00:42:35.248
how the proof would run.
So let's pause for a second and

00:42:35.248 --> 00:42:39.098
just see where we are.
What we've managed to show is

00:42:39.098 --> 00:42:42.760
there's a connection here
between dominance and

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:46.815
evolutionarily stable.
We've said if a strategy is not

00:42:46.815 --> 00:42:49.880
dominated it cannot be
evolutionarily stable.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.250
We've also begun to show a
connection between Nash

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.070
Equilibrium and evolutionary
stability.

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.137
So two of the ideas we've
developed over the last six

00:42:59.137 --> 00:43:02.440
weeks are re-emerging in this
completely other context of

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.626
animal behavior.
The idea of dominance and the

00:43:05.626 --> 00:43:08.809
idea of Nash,
and so far how far have we got?

00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:13.337
We've said that if something's
going to be evolutionarily

00:43:13.337 --> 00:43:17.460
stable it better be the case
that it's also Nash.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:21.045
That raises I think a natural
question which is,

00:43:21.045 --> 00:43:24.251
is the opposite true?
It would be really pretty great

00:43:24.251 --> 00:43:26.030
if it were true the other way
around.

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:31.477
If I could show that if a
strategy was Nash then it would

00:43:31.477 --> 00:43:34.997
necessarily also be ES.
That would be pretty cool,

00:43:34.997 --> 00:43:36.789
right?
This idea we've spent a lot of

00:43:36.789 --> 00:43:39.739
time developing in the class
turns out to be the key idea.

00:43:39.739 --> 00:43:42.240
Unfortunately,
life isn't quite so neat.

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:42.510
Let's see why.

00:43:50.219 --> 00:43:53.478
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to show you an

00:43:53.478 --> 00:43:57.247
example and what our example's
going to illustrate is we can

00:43:57.247 --> 00:44:01.079
find Nash strategies that are
not evolutionarily stable,

00:44:01.079 --> 00:44:05.679
and the example is
embarrassingly simple.

00:44:05.679 --> 00:44:10.221
Here's a game,
it's a two player,

00:44:10.221 --> 00:44:16.323
two strategy game and the
payoffs are (1,1),

00:44:16.323 --> 00:44:19.730
(0,0), (0,0),
(0,0).

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:22.329
This is kind of an
embarrassingly simple game.

00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:26.900
What are the Nash Equilibria in
this game?

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:31.161
Well let's go through slowly.
If Player row is playing A,

00:44:31.161 --> 00:44:36.987
then column's best response is
to pick A and if player row is

00:44:36.987 --> 00:44:41.091
playing B,
then column's best response is

00:44:41.091 --> 00:44:45.221
either to play A or B.
If column is playing A,

00:44:45.221 --> 00:44:48.699
then row's best response is to
choose A.

00:44:48.699 --> 00:44:52.745
If column is playing B,
then row's best response is

00:44:52.745 --> 00:44:55.880
either A or B.
So this is the kind of exercise

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:58.670
that is almost second nature for
you guys now.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:03.738
So we can conclude by looking
where the Nash,

00:45:03.738 --> 00:45:09.382
where these best responses
coincide, that the Nash

00:45:09.382 --> 00:45:13.990
Equilibria here are (A,A) and
(B,B).

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:18.564
Everyone happy with that?
You should be looking like yeah

00:45:18.564 --> 00:45:20.429
this is easy,
right?

00:45:20.429 --> 00:45:24.375
So all right,
but let's look at this second

00:45:24.375 --> 00:45:28.055
Nash Equilibrium.
The (B,B) Nash Equilibrium,

00:45:28.055 --> 00:45:31.400
the one that's down here.
Is B evolutionarily stable?

00:45:41.179 --> 00:45:43.444
Well again let's think about
it, let's just think through the

00:45:43.444 --> 00:45:47.361
exercise.
Suppose the entire class were

00:45:47.361 --> 00:45:50.776
playing B.
Wake up the guy in the middle

00:45:50.776 --> 00:45:55.059
and tell him he's playing B too.
The whole class is playing B

00:45:55.059 --> 00:45:58.199
and suppose there's an invasion.
What could the invasion be?

00:45:58.199 --> 00:46:01.869
The invasion better be an
invasion of A's.

00:46:01.869 --> 00:46:05.386
What's going to be the expected
payoff or the average payoff of

00:46:05.386 --> 00:46:07.939
the incumbents,
of all of you in the class who

00:46:07.939 --> 00:46:10.410
are playing B?
Well, without doing it too

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:13.200
laboriously, 1 - ε
of the time you're going to

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.989
meet another student in which
case your payoff,

00:46:15.989 --> 00:46:18.854
in which case you'll be playing
B against B and your payoff will

00:46:18.854 --> 00:46:21.309
0 and ε of the time you're
going to meet a T.A.

00:46:21.309 --> 00:46:24.887
and these T.A.'s are playing A,
but again, you'll get 0,

00:46:24.887 --> 00:46:27.360
so your average payoff will be
what?

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:33.277
0, your payoff will be 0.
So if you're an incumbent and

00:46:33.277 --> 00:46:38.080
you, against this mix,
your payoff will be 0.

00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.210
And if you're an invader?
So how is Rahul doing this time?

00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:45.849
Rahul's playing A.
1 - ε of the time this A

00:46:45.849 --> 00:46:49.250
is playing against B,
so 1 - ε

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:53.250
of the time he's playing
against a B.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:57.167
So 1 - ε
of the time Rahul meets a

00:46:57.167 --> 00:47:03.725
student and gets a payoff of 0.
But ε of the time Rahul

00:47:03.725 --> 00:47:08.459
hits it lucky and Rahul meets
another T.A.,

00:47:08.459 --> 00:47:15.110
Rahul meets Jake and when he
meets Jake his payoff is 1.

00:47:15.110 --> 00:47:20.740
Is that correct?
So his total average payoff is

00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:27.486
ε, which is bigger than 0,
so indeed, it turns out that

00:47:27.486 --> 00:47:32.659
Rahul's gene is going to grow,
the B's are going to shrink.

00:47:32.659 --> 00:47:37.865
(B,B) was Nash but it's not
evolutionarily stable,

00:47:37.865 --> 00:47:40.889
it can be invaded.
Everyone see that?

00:47:40.889 --> 00:47:42.500
Everyone see how that invasion
worked?

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:46.460
So the key to that invasion was
when Rahul met another incumbent

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.792
student he did no better than
the students did against

00:47:49.792 --> 00:47:52.912
students.
But on those rare occasions

00:47:52.912 --> 00:47:57.282
when Rahul met another T.A.
he made hay--or not hay,

00:47:57.282 --> 00:48:01.329
it's asexual reproduction--he
got a payoff of 1.

00:48:01.329 --> 00:48:05.469
Those rare occasions were
enough to make Rahul grow and

00:48:05.469 --> 00:48:08.766
thrive, whereas the B's
relatively speaking,

00:48:08.766 --> 00:48:12.199
shrank.
Everyone happy with that?

00:48:12.199 --> 00:48:15.757
Okay, so what we have here is
an example of something that is

00:48:15.757 --> 00:48:18.130
Nash but is not evolutionarily
stable.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:20.590
Can anyone say what's special
about this example?

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:25.203
How did I rig this example?
There's something really kind

00:48:25.203 --> 00:48:27.510
of knife edged and rigged about
this example.

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:30.900
What's rigged about this
example?

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:35.531
Anybody?
I don't want to cold call on

00:48:35.531 --> 00:48:39.671
this.
No takers, everyone's kind of

00:48:39.671 --> 00:48:44.463
in that pre-midterm scared mode.
This guy is rescuing,

00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:45.790
this guy is saving the class
today.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:47.759
Someone else has to get in.
What's your name again,

00:48:47.759 --> 00:48:48.940
I forgot your name?
Student: Steven.

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.495
Professor Ben Polak: So
Steven is saving the rest of

00:48:50.495 --> 00:48:52.528
you, but go ahead Steven.
Student: B is only a

00:48:52.528 --> 00:48:55.823
weak best response to anything.
Professor Ben Polak:

00:48:55.823 --> 00:48:59.826
Good, so what's true about this
example is that although B is a

00:48:59.826 --> 00:49:02.990
best response against B,
it only is so weakly.

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:06.070
Is that right?
It's only so weakly.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:09.103
If, in fact,
we got rid of Nash Equilibria

00:49:09.103 --> 00:49:13.468
that relied only on weak best
responses, then we wouldn't be

00:49:13.468 --> 00:49:16.964
able to produce this example.
So, in particular,

00:49:16.964 --> 00:49:19.658
if we looked at Nash
Equilibria, where the Nash

00:49:19.658 --> 00:49:22.059
strategy was strictly a best
response,

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:26.224
it was strictly better than
playing any other pure strategy,

00:49:26.224 --> 00:49:29.400
those cases would be
evolutionarily stable.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:33.499
Anybody remember what we call
Nash Equilibria where the Nash

00:49:33.499 --> 00:49:36.070
strategy is a strict best
response?

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:43.663
We call them strict Nash,
so it is in fact true,

00:49:43.663 --> 00:49:50.610
is if (S,S) is a strict Nash
Equilibrium,

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:56.364
by which I mean S is a strict
best response to S,

00:49:56.364 --> 00:50:00.920
then S is a Nash
equilibrium--sorry,

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.510
S is evolutionarily stable.

00:50:14.199 --> 00:50:16.932
Okay, so we've been pretty,
we've been only semi-formal so

00:50:16.932 --> 00:50:18.734
far.
I haven't really put up a

00:50:18.734 --> 00:50:21.398
formal definition,
and what I've been groping

00:50:21.398 --> 00:50:25.032
towards slowly is a connection
between an idea growing out of

00:50:25.032 --> 00:50:27.654
biology,
namely evolutionarily stable,

00:50:27.654 --> 00:50:31.070
and an idea growing out of
Economics and Mathematics,

00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:35.194
namely Nash Equilibrium.
What I want to do now is I

00:50:35.194 --> 00:50:38.710
wanted to show you formally how
are these connected.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:41.325
I'm not going to prove this
part of the class,

00:50:41.325 --> 00:50:43.360
because a proof is a bit
lengthy,

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.167
but I will include a proof on
the handout that's going to be

00:50:47.167 --> 00:50:52.347
available this afternoon.
I'm just going to argue it for

00:50:52.347 --> 00:50:54.889
now.
Here we go, there's some chalk.

00:50:54.889 --> 00:51:00.169
So what I want to do first is I
want to write down a formal

00:51:00.169 --> 00:51:03.719
definition of evolutionary
stability.

00:51:03.719 --> 00:51:07.268
It's a definition that comes
out of biology and it's a little

00:51:07.268 --> 00:51:10.817
bit of a, you're going to see
it's a little bit of a mouthful

00:51:10.817 --> 00:51:13.442
this definition.
So for those people who are a

00:51:13.442 --> 00:51:15.729
little bit sleepy,
you need to wake up a little

00:51:15.729 --> 00:51:18.514
bit, because it's going to be a
little bit of a difficult

00:51:18.514 --> 00:51:22.058
definition.
But this is the definition that

00:51:22.058 --> 00:51:27.159
came out of biology.
This is a formal definition.

00:51:27.159 --> 00:51:31.514
It comes out of biology,
and in particular,

00:51:31.514 --> 00:51:37.216
it's due to a guy called
Maynard Smith who wrote this in

00:51:37.216 --> 00:51:40.385
1972.
So obviously the earlier idea

00:51:40.385 --> 00:51:44.009
is due to Darwin,
but this formal idea is due to

00:51:44.009 --> 00:51:47.940
Maynard Smith.
So here's our formal definition.

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:57.277
So in a symmetric two player
game--so everything we've been

00:51:57.277 --> 00:52:04.941
looking at so far --,
the pure strategy S--let's call

00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:12.609
it Ŝ,--let's give it a name
--, is evolutionarily stable

00:52:12.609 --> 00:52:17.210
--and again I'll use ES for
that,

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:19.530
but let me be a little bit
nerdy here.

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:22.854
I'm going to say in pure
strategies: it's evolutionarily

00:52:22.854 --> 00:52:26.299
stable in pure strategies--and
I'm putting this in because

00:52:26.299 --> 00:52:29.442
we're going to come back on
Monday and consider mixed

00:52:29.442 --> 00:52:32.694
strategies.
So it's evolutionarily stable

00:52:32.694 --> 00:52:36.682
in pure strategies if,
and just leave a little bit of

00:52:36.682 --> 00:52:38.751
a space here,
because I'm going to need a

00:52:38.751 --> 00:52:40.310
little bit of space between
these next two lines,

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:45.967
leave a little space here.
So here's our big mouthful,

00:52:45.967 --> 00:52:53.308
what we need is 1 - ε
of the payoff of playing Ŝ

00:52:53.308 --> 00:52:58.717
against Ŝ
plus ε of the payoff of

00:52:58.717 --> 00:53:04.255
playing Ŝ
against S' has to be strictly

00:53:04.255 --> 00:53:10.565
bigger than 1 - ε
of the payoff of playing S'

00:53:10.565 --> 00:53:15.974
against Ŝ
plus ε of the payoff of

00:53:15.974 --> 00:53:24.768
playing S' against itself.
This has to be true for all

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:29.990
possible deviations S',
but we also,

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:35.659
this is why we need the extra
line,

00:53:35.659 --> 00:53:47.253
and for all mutation sizes
ε less than some

00:53:47.253 --> 00:53:53.860
ε-bar.
This is where I need to go back

00:53:53.860 --> 00:54:00.442
and just be a bit more careful,
so I'm going to write on this

00:54:00.442 --> 00:54:05.050
extra line, there exists an
ε-bar.

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:06.610
That's why I left the extra
line there.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.130
So this looks like very nerdy
things.

00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:11.289
Let's talk our way through it.
What's it saying?

00:54:11.289 --> 00:54:15.392
It's saying that Ŝ
is evolutionarily stable if

00:54:15.392 --> 00:54:20.489
against all possible mutations,
so all possible versions of

00:54:20.489 --> 00:54:25.800
Rahul S', the payoff of Ŝ
against the subsequently mixed

00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:30.492
population is bigger than the
payoff of S' against the

00:54:30.492 --> 00:54:34.880
subsequently mixed population.
Let's just see why that is so.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:38.191
So this on the left is the
payoff of Ŝ

00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:43.079
against a population in which 1
- ε of the population like

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:47.099
it is playing Ŝ
and ε of the population is

00:54:47.099 --> 00:54:49.903
like Rahul,
because 1 - ε

00:54:49.903 --> 00:54:54.211
of the time it meets something
like itself, and ε

00:54:54.211 --> 00:54:58.206
of the time it meets a T.A.
Conversely, on the right hand

00:54:58.206 --> 00:55:00.460
side, we have the payoff to the
mutation.

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:04.190
The payoff to the mutation is 1
- ε of the time the T.A.

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:08.142
meets a student and gets the
payoff of S' against Ŝ,

00:55:08.142 --> 00:55:12.210
ε of the time the T.A.
meets itself and gets a payoff

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:15.376
of S' against S',
and we have this inequality we

00:55:15.376 --> 00:55:19.189
had before,
that says the mutation invader

00:55:19.189 --> 00:55:23.598
has to do worse so it dies out.
So the nasty bit of this

00:55:23.598 --> 00:55:26.970
definition, the part that's a
little bit--it takes a while to

00:55:26.970 --> 00:55:30.117
get your head around--is this
qualifier about the size of

00:55:30.117 --> 00:55:32.419
mutations.
And all it's saying,

00:55:32.419 --> 00:55:36.215
ignore the math of it,
all it's saying is this better

00:55:36.215 --> 00:55:40.613
be true for all small mutations.
You could think of that saying,

00:55:40.613 --> 00:55:43.289
this has to be true for all
small mutations.

00:55:43.289 --> 00:55:46.587
So this definition from biology
is exactly, it exactly mimics

00:55:46.587 --> 00:55:49.610
the argument which we went
through several times now,

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:53.499
both using the class and using
the board and figuring out

00:55:53.499 --> 00:55:55.829
average payoffs.
This is an ugly definition.

00:55:55.829 --> 00:55:58.659
Everyone agree this is kind of
ugly?

00:55:58.659 --> 00:56:00.876
So now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to give you an

00:56:00.876 --> 00:56:02.190
entirely different definition.

00:56:05.539 --> 00:56:07.060
It's also going to be ugly but
a little bit less ugly.

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:17.232
So think of that as Definition
1, and it came from biology,

00:56:17.232 --> 00:56:19.110
it came from this paper in
1972.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.880
I think it was in Nature by
Maynard Smith and co-authors.

00:56:29.449 --> 00:56:33.449
Think of this other definition,
that's coming out of Economics.

00:56:33.449 --> 00:56:39.503
So Definition 2,
a strategy Ŝ--I should

00:56:39.503 --> 00:56:46.964
have had the same qualifier,
in a symmetric two player

00:56:46.964 --> 00:56:54.284
game--same thing to start off
with--a strategy Ŝ

00:56:54.284 --> 00:57:02.168
is ES in pure strategies--so
same as we had before if two

00:57:02.168 --> 00:57:06.648
things.
Thing number one,

00:57:06.648 --> 00:57:12.918
let's call it A,
if (Ŝ, Ŝ) is a Nash

00:57:12.918 --> 00:57:20.859
Equilibrium--is a symmetric
obviously--is a symmetric Nash

00:57:20.859 --> 00:57:27.269
Equilibrium of the game.
We're not done yet.

00:57:27.269 --> 00:57:29.446
Let me just write down what it
means to be a symmetric Nash

00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:31.210
Equilibrium of the game,
what does that mean?

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:35.849
That means i.e.,
the payoff of Ŝ

00:57:35.849 --> 00:57:41.518
against Ŝ
must be at least as big as the

00:57:41.518 --> 00:57:47.059
payoff of S' against Ŝ
for all S'.

00:57:47.059 --> 00:57:50.713
That's just a standard thing
we've seen it many,

00:57:50.713 --> 00:57:54.755
many times, it says Ŝ
is a best response against

00:57:54.755 --> 00:57:58.820
Ŝ.
We're not quite done yet.

00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:07.539
And B: what else do we need?
We need, if this weak

00:58:07.539 --> 00:58:14.165
inequality I wrote above is
actually an equality,

00:58:14.165 --> 00:58:20.929
if the payoff of Ŝ
against itself is actually

00:58:20.929 --> 00:58:27.280
equal to the payoff of S'
against Ŝ,

00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:34.300
then the payoff of Ŝ
against S' must be bigger than

00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:39.987
the payoff of S' against itself.
So this is still a bit of a

00:58:39.987 --> 00:58:42.933
mouthful, but I claim it's going
to end up being--it ends up

00:58:42.933 --> 00:58:44.980
being a little simpler to think
about.

00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:48.655
So let's see what it says
again, it says Ŝ

00:58:48.655 --> 00:58:52.969
is evolutionarily stable if
it's a Nash Equilibrium,

00:58:52.969 --> 00:58:58.420
that's basically this and if
it's only a weak Nash

00:58:58.420 --> 00:59:06.251
Equilibrium--there's a tie --,
then it better beat up on the

00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:09.806
mutant.
It better beat up on the mutant

00:59:09.806 --> 00:59:11.800
when it meets the mutant.

00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:18.576
I'm going to try and give you
an intuition as to why this is

00:59:18.576 --> 00:59:21.076
true in a minute,
but first I want to tell you

00:59:21.076 --> 00:59:24.119
why you should care about this.
So without getting too

00:59:24.119 --> 00:59:27.119
religious, I want to tell you
why I think this is an exciting

00:59:27.119 --> 00:59:29.800
result.
Why am I dragging you through

00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.678
more algebra than usual?
So I'm going to give you two

00:59:32.678 --> 00:59:34.139
reasons why this is an important
result.

00:59:34.139 --> 00:59:39.597
The first is,
it's going to turn out that

00:59:39.597 --> 00:59:47.920
when we analyze games it's very
easy to check Definition 2.

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.769
It's going to turn out it's
very easy to check Definition 2.

00:59:50.769 --> 00:59:53.150
It's really rather a pain to
check Definition 1.

00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:55.365
Why?
Because you got to keep track

00:59:55.365 --> 00:59:56.857
of these ε
's and so on,

00:59:56.857 --> 00:59:59.894
but the fact that Definition 2
is equivalent to Definition

00:59:59.894 --> 01:00:02.280
1--did I say that?
That's the point.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:06.335
The fact that Definition 1 and
2 are equivalent--so 1 is

01:00:06.335 --> 01:00:10.907
equivalent to 2--the fact that
these definitions are equivalent

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:15.258
means we only have to check the
second definition and that's

01:00:15.258 --> 01:00:17.667
easy.
So when biologists are setting

01:00:17.667 --> 01:00:20.329
up experiments involving wasps
or ants, or lions,

01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:23.431
or chimpanzees,
provided they can check this in

01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:27.140
the game they're done,
and that turns out to be easy.

01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.709
And we'll see that on Monday.
That's the sort of instrumental

01:00:31.709 --> 01:00:33.663
reason.
Now I want to give you the

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:36.179
"religious" reason why you
should care about this.

01:00:36.179 --> 01:00:39.156
So let me just try--and I often
find that this appeals to like a

01:00:39.156 --> 01:00:42.039
third of the students and the
other two-thirds of the students

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:44.260
think I'm completely bonkers at
this point.

01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:45.572
So that's fine,
you can think I'm bonkers,

01:00:45.572 --> 01:00:47.527
that's fine.
For the third of you who are

01:00:47.527 --> 01:00:49.680
nerdy like me,
I want you to just see the

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.470
appeal of this.
Here we have two ideas.

01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:56.708
One idea arises out of biology.
I say it rose from Maynard

01:00:56.708 --> 01:00:58.789
Smith but it really comes from
Darwin.

01:00:58.789 --> 01:01:01.449
So it's a nineteenth century
idea in biology.

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:03.962
It's probably the most
important idea in biology in the

01:01:03.962 --> 01:01:06.344
nineteenth century.
It may be the most important

01:01:06.344 --> 01:01:09.690
idea in biology for 200 years.
Is that a fair judgment?

01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:12.719
The notion of evolutionary
stability.

01:01:12.719 --> 01:01:15.969
The other idea comes out of
Economics.

01:01:15.969 --> 01:01:19.630
It's looking at Nash Equilibria
and strict Nash Equilibria and

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:21.610
so on.
Up there we've got biology;

01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:25.563
down here we have Economics.
This is an idea that emerged in

01:01:25.563 --> 01:01:29.859
Economics in the twentieth
century in the 1950s,

01:01:29.859 --> 01:01:33.150
so roughly 80 years after
Darwin.

01:01:33.150 --> 01:01:37.633
This is a big idea in
Economics, this is a big idea in

01:01:37.633 --> 01:01:40.120
biology.
So what appeals to me because

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:43.175
I'm kind of a nerdy kind of guy
is I think it's kind of

01:01:43.175 --> 01:01:46.230
wonderful that those two ideas
are almost the same.

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:49.165
I think it's a beautiful thing
that those two ideas are kind of

01:01:49.165 --> 01:01:51.003
the same thing.
But now you are looking at me

01:01:51.003 --> 01:01:53.230
and thinking I'm bonkers.
So let me push it harder.

01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:55.630
So think back to the,
think about great intellectual

01:01:55.630 --> 01:01:58.445
coincidences of earlier periods.
Think about the seventeenth

01:01:58.445 --> 01:02:00.348
century.
In the seventeenth century

01:02:00.348 --> 01:02:03.575
people figured out that the
mechanical laws that governed

01:02:03.575 --> 01:02:07.205
the rotation of the planets were
at least approximately the same

01:02:07.205 --> 01:02:11.005
as those that governed a clock.
The basic laws of Newtonian

01:02:11.005 --> 01:02:14.135
Physics were the same,
and they thought this was a

01:02:14.135 --> 01:02:16.395
wonderful thing.
They have these completely

01:02:16.395 --> 01:02:18.847
different areas of intellectual
pursuit and they turned out to

01:02:18.847 --> 01:02:20.610
be the same.
In the scientific revolution,

01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:21.969
it turned out they were the
same.

01:02:21.969 --> 01:02:24.474
For those people who chose to
continue believing in God at

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.760
that point, they thought of God
now as being what?

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.340
As being a heavenly clock maker.
It was a wonderful moment.

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:34.051
So here, in our own time,
or perhaps just before it,

01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:37.377
we see a similar thing.
Here we see one of the most

01:02:37.377 --> 01:02:41.593
important ideas in science
coinciding with one of the most

01:02:41.593 --> 01:02:44.949
important ideas in Economics.
Where does this lead us?

01:02:44.949 --> 01:02:47.372
Well now I guess,
I mean the bad news is this may

01:02:47.372 --> 01:02:50.300
make a lot of people doubt the
existence of God I guess.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.753
[That's going to get me in
trouble, I didn't say that.]

01:02:52.753 --> 01:02:54.980
But at least if you did go on
believing in God,

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:58.745
you're going to have to believe
God's an economist,

01:02:58.745 --> 01:03:02.729
that's a pretty good thing.
So that's my little religious

01:03:02.729 --> 01:03:04.980
piece on this.
All right, now I want to spend

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:07.224
the last ten minutes,
having told you this wonderful

01:03:07.224 --> 01:03:09.087
thing,
trying to convince you that

01:03:09.087 --> 01:03:11.860
it's true, and again,
there's a proof on the handout

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:15.314
that you can read on the web.
I just want to give you an idea

01:03:15.314 --> 01:03:20.880
of why it's true.
Okay, so here we go.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:24.235
What I want to convince you of
is that this definition,

01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:27.714
this kind of Game Theory
definition, this Econ definition

01:03:27.714 --> 01:03:30.271
implies the one above.
The one above we kind of

01:03:30.271 --> 01:03:32.624
already argued several times
today, corresponds to the notion

01:03:32.624 --> 01:03:34.738
of evolutionarily stability.
We talked about it several

01:03:34.738 --> 01:03:35.940
times.
We wrote down these kind of

01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:39.645
equations several times.
So I want to convince you that

01:03:39.645 --> 01:03:43.604
this one implies that one.
So what do I have to convince

01:03:43.604 --> 01:03:45.942
you?
Let's imagine,

01:03:45.942 --> 01:03:54.164
let's fix, there's no way of
getting you to see that one

01:03:54.164 --> 01:04:01.040
without--no, never mind,
it was a bad idea.

01:04:11.050 --> 01:04:13.750
The embarrassment of playing
with heavy boards here.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:14.510
Alright let's try and shift
this one up.

01:04:21.039 --> 01:04:24.283
If you ever think of asking
your dean for some new

01:04:24.283 --> 01:04:27.394
technology for Yale,
we might think about having

01:04:27.394 --> 01:04:29.909
some slightly lighter
blackboards.

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:35.985
Just for the evolutionary
stability of the average

01:04:35.985 --> 01:04:42.802
weakling economist.
So what I'm going to do is

01:04:42.802 --> 01:04:52.037
let's fix a strategy Ŝ
and suppose (Ŝ,Ŝ) is

01:04:52.037 --> 01:04:56.552
in fact Nash.
What I want to convince you of

01:04:56.552 --> 01:04:59.309
is that Ŝ
is going to be evolutionarily

01:04:59.309 --> 01:05:02.536
stable.
So I claim there's two

01:05:02.536 --> 01:05:06.769
possibilities,
there are two cases.

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:13.666
The two cases are either it's
the case that Ŝ

01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:19.155
against Ŝ
does strictly better than

01:05:19.155 --> 01:05:25.337
Ŝ against S' for all S'.
So let's just be careful,

01:05:25.337 --> 01:05:28.657
since we know its Nash,
we already know that the payoff

01:05:28.657 --> 01:05:32.224
of Ŝ against itself is at
least weakly better than any

01:05:32.224 --> 01:05:35.170
possible deviation,
that's what it means to be Nash.

01:05:35.170 --> 01:05:37.376
So everyone agree with that?
We know that Ŝ

01:05:37.376 --> 01:05:41.845
is a best response to Ŝ,
so it must be weakly better

01:05:41.845 --> 01:05:45.857
than any possible deviation.
So let's take the first case,

01:05:45.857 --> 01:05:49.038
where actually it's strictly
better, and let's go back to our

01:05:49.038 --> 01:05:52.272
classroom example and suppose
that--let's go back to the first

01:05:52.272 --> 01:05:55.400
definition by going back to our
metaphor of the class.

01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:59.981
So you guys are all ants,
and suppose that every student

01:05:59.981 --> 01:06:04.262
in the class is playing Ŝ.
You're all playing Ŝ

01:06:04.262 --> 01:06:07.816
and suppose it's the case that
in fact the payoff of Ŝ

01:06:07.816 --> 01:06:10.390
against Ŝ
is bigger than the payoff of

01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:13.145
Ŝ against S',
and suppose that a mutation

01:06:13.145 --> 01:06:15.039
arises, sorry Rahul here we go
again.

01:06:15.039 --> 01:06:18.420
So as the mutation arises,
here's Rahul our mutation,

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:22.579
and he's going to be randomly
matched against one of you guys.

01:06:22.579 --> 01:06:27.710
So let's compare Rahul's payoff
against this gentleman's payoff.

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:28.810
Stand up a second.
Your name is?

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:30.179
Student: Pat.
Professor Ben Polak:

01:06:30.179 --> 01:06:32.259
Pat, all right.
So Pat is our typical Ŝ

01:06:32.259 --> 01:06:34.794
incumbent ant,
doesn't look like an ant but

01:06:34.794 --> 01:06:37.570
never mind, stretch your
imagination a bit.

01:06:37.570 --> 01:06:40.400
Most of the time what's
happening?

01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:43.434
Most of the time Pat is being
matched against one of the rest

01:06:43.434 --> 01:06:46.619
of you, and when he's matched
against one of the rest of you,

01:06:46.619 --> 01:06:49.700
he's getting the payoff Ŝ
against Ŝ,

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:53.464
which is U(Ŝ,Ŝ),
that's what he's getting most

01:06:53.464 --> 01:06:57.062
of the time.
Every now and then he's meeting

01:06:57.062 --> 01:06:59.501
a mutant.
Okay fine, so every now and

01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:02.219
then he's getting a slightly
different payoff,

01:07:02.219 --> 01:07:05.240
but most of the time he's
getting a payoff which is

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.880
U(Ŝ,Ŝ).
What about Rahul?

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.703
So Rahul, okay every now and
then he's going to be lucky and

01:07:11.703 --> 01:07:14.220
meet another T.A.,
but most of the time,

01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:17.650
almost all the time he's being
matched against one of you,

01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:20.440
for example he's matched
against Pat.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:25.380
When he's matched against Pat,
his payoff is U(Ŝ,S')

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.500
which is lower.
That right?

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:33.320
So Pat's payoff almost all the
time is U(Ŝ,Ŝ) and

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:38.639
Rahul's payoff almost all the
time is U(Ŝ,S').

01:07:38.639 --> 01:07:43.505
But our assumption is
U(Ŝ,S') is lower,

01:07:43.505 --> 01:07:48.473
so Rahul's going to die out.
So in this case,

01:07:48.473 --> 01:07:53.782
Rahul dies out because most of
the time he's playing an

01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:57.420
incumbent and just doing
horribly.

01:07:57.420 --> 01:08:01.237
Everyone convinced by that?
So in this case,

01:08:01.237 --> 01:08:13.329
the mutant dies out.
So the mutant dies out because

01:08:13.329 --> 01:08:22.000
she or he meets Ŝ
often.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.444
The mutant meets the incumbent
often and just does horribly

01:08:25.444 --> 01:08:29.992
against the incumbent.
That's the first case,

01:08:29.992 --> 01:08:38.506
that's case one and case two
is, it could be the case that in

01:08:38.506 --> 01:08:46.170
fact Rahul does pretty well
against the incumbents,

01:08:46.170 --> 01:08:51.331
but unfortunately for Rahul,
it could be the case,

01:08:51.331 --> 01:08:56.810
sorry, but in that case
according to Definition B,

01:08:56.810 --> 01:09:03.989
Rahul doesn't do so well
against other T.A.'s.

01:09:03.989 --> 01:09:07.031
So this is case two,
case one was Rahul just gets

01:09:07.031 --> 01:09:09.630
beaten up whenever he meets one
of you,

01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:11.305
sorry Rahul you are getting
beaten up a lot here,

01:09:11.305 --> 01:09:13.119
but Rahul gets beaten up when
he meets one of you,

01:09:13.119 --> 01:09:16.781
and here's the case where Rahul
is doing fine against you,

01:09:16.781 --> 01:09:19.480
but he does horribly against
incumbents,

01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.970
so that's the harder case.
Let's talk through that case.

01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:24.414
So back up again,
sorry Rahul you have to get up

01:09:24.414 --> 01:09:27.380
again, so once again you guys
are all playing Ŝ's,

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:32.436
there's a mutation of Rahul's
playing S', and let's get Pat up

01:09:32.436 --> 01:09:34.584
again.
So when Pat meets one of you

01:09:34.584 --> 01:09:37.713
guys, so let's pick out one of
you guys, so let me pick out,

01:09:37.713 --> 01:09:39.359
sorry your name is?
Student: Christine.

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:39.699
Professor Ben Polak:
Christine.

01:09:39.699 --> 01:09:43.286
So when Pat meets Christine,
which is most of the time,

01:09:43.286 --> 01:09:47.005
he does okay and when Rahul
meets Christine which happens

01:09:47.005 --> 01:09:50.039
most of the time,
he does exactly the same.

01:09:50.039 --> 01:09:54.013
So if you just compared them in
their random matches against

01:09:54.013 --> 01:09:57.380
Christine all the rest of you,
they're the same.

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.492
But every now and then instead,
every ε

01:10:01.492 --> 01:10:05.509
of the time,
rarely, Rahul is going to meet

01:10:05.509 --> 01:10:07.665
Jake,
Jake's writing,

01:10:07.665 --> 01:10:12.241
he's going to meet Kaj,
stand up a second and on those

01:10:12.241 --> 01:10:15.350
occasions let's see what
happens.

01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:19.777
So when Pat meets Kaj he does
pretty well, and he gets some

01:10:19.777 --> 01:10:24.051
big bonanza, he gets a much
bigger payoff than when Rahul

01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:27.036
meets Kaj,
they just do horribly against

01:10:27.036 --> 01:10:30.254
each other.
The fact that they do horribly

01:10:30.254 --> 01:10:33.730
against each other causes them
to die out.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.958
So let's just talk this through.
There were two ways in which

01:10:35.958 --> 01:10:38.656
Rahul could die out.
One is he dies out because he

01:10:38.656 --> 01:10:42.015
does horribly against you and
the second way he can die out is

01:10:42.015 --> 01:10:45.649
if he does equally well against
you as you do against yourself,

01:10:45.649 --> 01:10:48.909
but he does horribly when he
meets the other T.A.'s.

01:10:48.909 --> 01:10:52.297
In either case,
you guys are evolutionarily

01:10:52.297 --> 01:10:55.874
stable and Rahul is in trouble.
Was that convincing enough an

01:10:55.874 --> 01:10:58.506
argument?
There's a formal proof in the

01:10:58.506 --> 01:11:02.579
handout but this will be enough
to get us started.

01:11:02.579 --> 01:11:14.975
So in this case,
the mutant does okay against

01:11:14.975 --> 01:11:30.188
Ŝ but gets clobbered,
does badly let's say against

01:11:30.188 --> 01:11:33.900
S'.
So mutants that are going to

01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:37.692
die out are those that do badly
against incumbents or do badly

01:11:37.692 --> 01:11:40.691
against themselves.
In either case Ŝ

01:11:40.691 --> 01:11:44.710
will be evolutionarily stable.
Now next time I want to take

01:11:44.710 --> 01:11:48.410
this further in two directions.
I want to see what happens

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:51.773
about ES in more complicated
games, for example,

01:11:51.773 --> 01:11:55.852
in cooperation games and we're
going to see that evolution

01:11:55.852 --> 01:11:58.930
doesn't do great in cooperation
games.

01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:01.041
We'll also, if we have time,
going to look at sexual

01:12:01.041 --> 01:12:02.863
reproduction,
which is probably what you guys

01:12:02.863 --> 01:12:06.000
are all interested in anyway.
I'll see you all on Monday.

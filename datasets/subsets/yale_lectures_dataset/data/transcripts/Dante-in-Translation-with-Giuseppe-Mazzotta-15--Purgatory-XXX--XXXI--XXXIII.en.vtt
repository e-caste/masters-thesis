00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:10.023
Prof: With Canto XXVI,
the purgation of the pilgrim is

00:00:10.023 --> 00:00:11.660
completed.
 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.122
He has been going through the
various stages of Purgatory:

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:21.623
from pride,
as you remember,

00:00:21.623 --> 00:00:25.690
to the sin of lust and in
XXVII,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.818
he crosses a wall of fire,
so that he can be cleansed

00:00:31.818 --> 00:00:38.888
completely of all the stains
that may be residual on his soul

00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:44.310
and approach and enter the
Garden of Eden.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.260
This is the action that takes
place in XXVII and Canto XXVII

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.681
comes to a close with a passage
that I would like to read to you

00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.920
and comment on.
 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.052
It's at the end of Canto XXVII
and these are really the last

00:01:06.052 --> 00:01:08.750
words that Virgil will speak.
 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.090
We will not hear from him again.
 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.070
In fact, from now on,
the pilgrim will be entirely on

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.030
his own.
 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.159
There's no dependency on him.
 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.349
There is a sort of--actually
very personal moment now that

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:30.540
starts and we'll see the drama
that goes with time of--

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.269
this attainment of self-mastery
and Dante goes on dramatizing.

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:48.330
These are the last words that
he speaks from lines 130 on,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.039
"The temporal fire and the
eternal thou hast seen,"

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:00.629
meaning Purgatory and Hell
which lasts forever,

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:04.671
"my son,
and art come to a part where of

00:02:04.671 --> 00:02:07.980
myself I discern no
further."

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.060
This is the limitation of
Virgil's vision.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.927
This is--from now on he will be
following--even the geometry,

00:02:17.927 --> 00:02:22.818
the arrangement of their
journey will be completely

00:02:22.818 --> 00:02:24.090
reversed.
 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.115
Up to now, the pilgrim has been
a disciple, therefore,

00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:31.610
one who follows the vestiges of
the teacher.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.280
Now the teacher with Statius
will be following Virgil.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.068
He sees no further.
 

00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:46.272
And actually I can anticipate
for you the pathos of Virgil's

00:02:46.272 --> 00:02:49.752
departure--
sudden departure--when he,

00:02:49.752 --> 00:02:53.223
the pilgrim,
most wants him and needs him,

00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:57.568
because Beatrice is approaching
and the terror that--

00:02:57.568 --> 00:03:01.900
with a terror that Beatrice
represents for the pilgrim,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.069
the pilgrim will turn back and
his eyes will never see Virgil

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.758
again.
 

00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:11.211
Virgil has disappeared an
instant before he vanishes,

00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:15.258
an instant before Beatrice
arrives, as if there's a hiatus.

00:03:15.258 --> 00:03:20.586
Dante is dramatizing the hiatus
between the two guides and the

00:03:20.586 --> 00:03:25.740
two particular stages of his own
self-knowledge and life.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.669
Let me continue with this,
"Take henceforth thy

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:31.750
pleasure for guide."
 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.521
What an extraordinary line:
"take then henceforth thy

00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.310
pleasure for guide."
 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.092
This is the poem of desire in
the sense that what pushes the

00:03:42.092 --> 00:03:47.200
pilgrim to go on and impels him
to this journey of discovery and

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.120
self-discovery is really desire.
 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.937
Desire is the moving force in
him, but now the language

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:58.199
changes.
 

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:03.127
Now in a sense a certain--the
first part of the journey is

00:04:03.127 --> 00:04:08.489
over and pleasure can become the
guide, the guidance of his own

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.908
pleasure, what he likes.
 

00:04:10.908 --> 00:04:13.489
That is to say,
in a sense, it's an adumbration

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.330
of free will.
 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.149
We'll talk more about the
relationship between actually

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.737
pleasure and happiness,
the way Dante will go on

00:04:21.737 --> 00:04:25.670
dramatizing it and thinking
about in Paradise.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.459
"Thou hast come forth from
the steep and narrow ways.

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:32.670
See the sun that shines on thy
brow.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.529
See the grass,"
near the earthly paradise,

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:38.120
"See the grass,
the flowers,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.651
and trees which the ground here
brings forth of itself

00:04:42.651 --> 00:04:43.850
alone."
 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.680
It is as, by Dante,
by taking his own pleasure as

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.952
his guidance,
he now has reached an edenic

00:04:50.952 --> 00:04:51.750
place.
 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.514
Virgil is speaking of the
pilgrim as if he were speaking

00:04:56.514 --> 00:05:01.800
of the ground that thrives until
the ground, the land produces

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.360
spontaneously.
 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.081
Now he's capable at spontaneous
action and spontaneous

00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:09.149
decisions.
 

00:05:09.149 --> 00:05:14.444
"Till their fair eyes come
rejoicing which weeping may

00:05:14.444 --> 00:05:19.189
come--made me come to thee thou
mayst sit or go among

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:20.560
them."
 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.057
Two details are expressed by
these lines: one is Virgil is

00:05:26.057 --> 00:05:32.040
recapitulating in many ways this
first part of the journey,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.976
the journey that began in
Inferno I and ends here

00:05:34.976 --> 00:05:37.190
in Purgatorio,
in the Garden of Eden.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.660
It began in the wilderness and
ends in the Garden.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:44.009
This is the first step of--the
first stage of the journey.

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:48.273
You can now--he remembers,
that's how recapitulates

00:05:48.273 --> 00:05:50.319
"the fair eyes...
 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.565
that made me,"
that begged me to come to your

00:05:54.565 --> 00:05:59.680
help when you were lost and
shipwrecked on the wilderness of

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.274
Inferno I;
so now Virgil is going back to

00:06:04.274 --> 00:06:04.829
that.
 

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:07.788
The second element is that this
is the exercise:

00:06:07.788 --> 00:06:11.000
"Now thou mayest sit or go
among them."

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.720
Now this is exactly the major
temptation for the pilgrim.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.456
Is he going to think that the
journey to the Garden of Eden,

00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:22.939
which is a journey ahead,
forward, but a journey back in

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:23.509
time?
 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.146
The Garden of Eden is behind
all of us and yet it lies ahead

00:06:27.146 --> 00:06:27.639
of us.
 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:30.199
The past is really the future.
 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:35.600
He must decide whether he can
go on or sit here.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.879
It's a first decision.
 

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:40.636
Is he going to think that the
journey is the journey to the

00:06:40.636 --> 00:06:44.458
complacencies of the Garden,
to the beauty and attraction of

00:06:44.458 --> 00:06:45.430
the Garden?
 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.363
Or is he going to turn,
as he actually will--we can say

00:06:49.363 --> 00:06:51.985
that because we have
Paradise,

00:06:51.985 --> 00:06:55.410
that he writes--into an
anti-pastoral poet.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.184
That is to say one,
a poet who is always

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:02.524
questioning the sense of arrival
and is always going on to new

00:07:02.524 --> 00:07:05.300
departures that's really what
the--

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.569
Virgil is telling him.
 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:09.399
Now this is up to you;
you have arrived here;

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:12.519
you have arrived there where I
am, where Virgil is,

00:07:12.519 --> 00:07:14.329
or you can even go further.
 

00:07:14.329 --> 00:07:18.937
There's a peculiar language
that resonates behind this kind

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:24.180
of moral dilemma which is placed
in front of the pilgrim's mind.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.452
It's called felix culpa,
I don't know if you have--those

00:07:28.452 --> 00:07:33.069
of you who are readers of Milton
may know what I'm talking about.

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:36.831
Felix culpa,
the idea that the fall of man

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:41.971
was actually a happy fall,
because it allows human beings

00:07:41.971 --> 00:07:45.000
to even want to go beyond it.
 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.240
That's exactly what is
resonating behind this.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.769
You may sit and therefore turn
into an Adam figure,

00:07:52.769 --> 00:07:57.144
who is going back to the beauty
and innocence which the pilgrim

00:07:57.144 --> 00:07:58.839
doesn't have really.
 

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:03.129
He has a wisdom now of the
Garden or you can go on even

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:04.720
further than that.
 

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:10.637
Then here is the final moment
of a circle which now takes over

00:08:10.637 --> 00:08:15.971
for the Purgatorio
itself: "No longer expect

00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:18.980
word or sign from me."
 

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:24.463
That's exactly--the teaching of
Virgil has been completed and

00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:27.480
then he ends with:
"Free,

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.365
upright and whole is thy will,
and it were a fault not to act

00:08:32.365 --> 00:08:36.702
on its bidding;
therefore, over thyself I crown

00:08:36.702 --> 00:08:38.798
and miter thee."
 

00:08:38.798 --> 00:08:42.466
This is the attainment of the
free will so that the whole

00:08:42.466 --> 00:08:46.461
Purgatorio moves between
two poles: the pole of liberty

00:08:46.461 --> 00:08:50.359
which was Cato's object,
the object of his quest through

00:08:50.359 --> 00:08:52.808
the wilderness of the Libyan
desert,

00:08:52.808 --> 00:08:57.597
and now the attainment of the
free will which allows the

00:08:57.597 --> 00:09:00.820
pilgrim to view it as a
condition,

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.182
not just a point of arrival,
but the necessary pre-condition

00:09:05.182 --> 00:09:06.440
for moral life.
 

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.932
You can never really have an
autonomous moral life only in

00:09:09.932 --> 00:09:13.610
the measure in which you think
you can have the free will.

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:16.970
Now the pilgrim is his own
responsibility.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.586
Let me say that once he's under
the guidance of Beatrice the

00:09:20.586 --> 00:09:21.966
issues,
especially when it comes to

00:09:21.966 --> 00:09:23.783
Paradise,
there will be moral problems

00:09:23.783 --> 00:09:26.533
while he is in the Garden of
Eden we are going to look at in

00:09:26.533 --> 00:09:28.586
a moment,
but in Paradise

00:09:28.586 --> 00:09:30.100
aesthetics takes over.
 

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.298
It's no longer an ethical
problem.

00:09:32.298 --> 00:09:35.355
Dante refers,
you may have heard about recent

00:09:35.355 --> 00:09:38.690
philosophers who think that life
is arranged--

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.999
or knowledge is
arranged--according to stages:

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:44.865
the aesthetic,
the ethical and then the

00:09:44.865 --> 00:09:45.740
theological.
 

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.749
Dante reverses this,
the point that seems to be the

00:09:49.749 --> 00:09:54.080
most mature is that dealing with
the aesthetic one,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.168
which others may view as the
superficial,

00:09:56.168 --> 00:09:58.570
the elementary one,
the one where we are--

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.476
perceptions are going to be
engaged and then at the time of

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:06.451
disengagement even before you
can get involved and mature in

00:10:06.451 --> 00:10:08.070
ethical experiences.
 

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.495
Dante changes;
there are no ethical dilemmas

00:10:11.495 --> 00:10:13.168
in Paradise.
 

00:10:13.168 --> 00:10:16.558
Once you are in Paradise
you can only enjoy and get to

00:10:16.558 --> 00:10:17.519
know the world.
 

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:21.429
All the problems are
intellectual problems,

00:10:21.429 --> 00:10:23.200
not moral issues.
 

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.080
"So free upright and whole
is the will,

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.190
and it were a fall not to act
on its bidding,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.960
therefore, over thyself I crown
and miter thee."

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.042
This is a kind of secular
coronation ceremony,

00:10:36.042 --> 00:10:41.485
the crown--the royal and the
episcopal--royal and the bishop,

00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:44.658
which is a way of consecrating.
 

00:10:44.658 --> 00:10:47.740
Virgil acts as a kind of lay
priest,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:52.897
consecrating the attainment of
self-mastery in this moment

00:10:52.897 --> 00:10:58.416
which could become a moment of
self-assertion and yet Dante is

00:10:58.416 --> 00:11:02.850
very careful in how he navigates
all of this.

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:06.889
Now from Canto XXVIII to Canto
XXXIII, which is the end of the

00:11:06.889 --> 00:11:10.399
poem, we come to an area which
is another fragment.

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:13.851
You already read a kind of
segment which I will call the

00:11:13.851 --> 00:11:17.826
literary segment that--
with Professor Lummus whom I'm

00:11:17.826 --> 00:11:21.033
very grateful to--
covered and explained to you

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:22.720
and did with you last time.
 

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.639
That's a literary segment that
goes from XXI to XXVI.

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:32.394
Now from XXVIII to XXXIII we
have a different segment which

00:11:32.394 --> 00:11:35.428
is--let's call it a pastoral
oasis.

00:11:35.428 --> 00:11:41.083
It's also the representation of
what in classical literature is

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:43.820
called locus amoenus.
 

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:49.000
You may have seen adumbrations
of this even in Limbo.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.791
That's one of them,
this lovely spot outside of the

00:11:52.791 --> 00:11:57.643
world of history where something
of relaxation can take place and

00:11:57.643 --> 00:12:01.736
it's also which Dante combines
actually with a biblical

00:12:01.736 --> 00:12:04.787
hortus,
enclosed garden,

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:07.447
the Song of Songs,
for instance,

00:12:07.447 --> 00:12:10.480
or the Garden of Eden hortus
conclusus.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.243
The interesting thing about
Dante's representation of the

00:12:14.243 --> 00:12:18.070
locus amoenus is it's never
really outside of history;

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.210
it becomes.
 

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.421
That's the assumption:
you have the garden and you

00:12:22.421 --> 00:12:23.470
have the city.
 

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:28.138
This is the dual imagination
whenever life becomes unbearable

00:12:28.138 --> 00:12:32.572
in the city you take off and go
into a villa in the garden

00:12:32.572 --> 00:12:37.841
somewhere and find a relief,
aesthetic relief from the

00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:43.570
hustle--the time-- of hustle and
bustle of the city.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:45.158
Dante combines the two.
 

00:12:45.158 --> 00:12:48.288
There's no easy position
between them,

00:12:48.288 --> 00:12:52.870
in the sense that the Garden of
Eden where he finds himself,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.509
is going to be the place of--a
very problematical place,

00:12:57.509 --> 00:13:02.668
a place where the pilgrim is
engaged in a self-confrontation.

00:13:02.668 --> 00:13:10.533
He experiences some actually
terrifying moments in the

00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:16.188
encounter with Beatrice,
so the Garden of Eden is

00:13:16.188 --> 00:13:20.519
represented in Canto XXVIII and
I want to read a few passages.

00:13:20.519 --> 00:13:26.190
This is--you see how this
representation is carried out,

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.942
"Eager now to
search,"

00:13:28.942 --> 00:13:33.374
I'm reading from XXVIII,
lines 1 and following,

00:13:33.374 --> 00:13:39.014
and I'll go pretty slowly over
this: "Eager now to search

00:13:39.014 --> 00:13:44.100
within and about the divine
forest green and dense,

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:47.490
which tempered to my eyes the
new day,

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.389
I left the slope without
waiting longer,

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:54.062
taking the level very slowly
over the ground which gave

00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:56.240
fragrance on every side."
 

00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.009
It's the classical--this
is--the warehouse of the

00:14:01.009 --> 00:14:05.778
pastoral tradition is found
here, a fragrance;

00:14:05.778 --> 00:14:09.663
there's a running brook,
deep shades,

00:14:09.663 --> 00:14:14.196
the birds seem to be rivaling
human beings,

00:14:14.196 --> 00:14:19.177
introducing songs;
plentitude of the natural order

00:14:19.177 --> 00:14:23.048
and even the innocence of the
natural order,

00:14:23.048 --> 00:14:26.739
with the exception that Dante
comes and though he has been

00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:30.557
cleansed and gone through the
wall of fire to further purify

00:14:30.557 --> 00:14:34.820
him,
he is not the kind of new Adam.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.379
He carries with him the stains
of experience and the stains of

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:45.394
history, so there is desire that
acts in him, but let me

00:14:45.394 --> 00:14:46.580
continue.
 

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.870
"A sweet air that was
without change was striking on

00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:52.808
my brow with the force only of a
gentle breeze,

00:14:52.808 --> 00:14:56.020
by which the fluttering bows
all bent freely to the part

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.000
where the holy mountain throws
its first shadow,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.381
yet were not so much swayed
from their erectness that the

00:15:02.381 --> 00:15:06.370
little birds in the tops did not
still practice all their arts,

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.520
but, singing,
they greeted the morning hours

00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:12.379
with full gladness among the
leaves,

00:15:12.379 --> 00:15:16.072
which kept such undertone to
their rhymes as gathers from

00:15:16.072 --> 00:15:19.895
branch to branch in the pine
wood of the Chiassi shore when

00:15:19.895 --> 00:15:22.269
Aeolus looses the Sirocco."
 

00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:24.200
The interesting thing which is
some kind of--

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.769
the poignancy of the
autobiography and--

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:35.202
is that Dante is imagining the
Garden of Eden as the pine wood

00:15:35.202 --> 00:15:37.921
near Ravenna,
which has completely

00:15:37.921 --> 00:15:41.755
disappeared since then,
but you can imagine how he

00:15:41.755 --> 00:15:47.730
would take the morning walks in
the pine trees around the city

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:50.570
and on the way to the sea.
 

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:53.607
And that, to him,
was the garden:

00:15:53.607 --> 00:15:58.259
this mixture of the ordinary
and the great sublime

00:15:58.259 --> 00:15:59.779
imagination.
 

00:15:59.779 --> 00:16:03.960
That's what I'm--I think he
wants to convey to us.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:07.500
And now he continues,
and I will ask you a question.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.019
I want you to think about what
I'm going to ask you,

00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:14.995
because you're expected to have
a shock of recognition in the

00:16:14.995 --> 00:16:18.244
next three lines,
and these are the lines in

00:16:18.244 --> 00:16:18.908
English.
 

00:16:18.908 --> 00:16:22.341
I'll read them in Italian,
another little homage to my

00:16:22.341 --> 00:16:25.567
friend, Professor Brooks:
Già

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:29.548
m'avean trasportato i lenti
passi

00:16:29.548 --> 00:16:33.750
dentro alla selva antica tanto,
ch'io

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:37.548
non potea rivedere ond'io mi
'ntrassi

00:16:37.548 --> 00:16:40.610
ed ecco più
andar mi tolse un rio,

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.230
che 'nver sinistra con sue
picciole onde

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.470
piegava l'erba che 'n sua ripa
uscìo.

00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:49.433
And in English is:
"Already my small steps

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:53.365
had brought me so far within the
ancient wood that I could not

00:16:53.365 --> 00:16:55.879
see the place where I had
entered,

00:16:55.879 --> 00:17:00.629
and lo, my going farther was
prevented by stream with which

00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:05.461
its little waves bent leftwards
the grass that sprang on its

00:17:05.461 --> 00:17:06.690
bank."
 

00:17:06.690 --> 00:17:10.128
This is my question,
what is this--what do these

00:17:10.128 --> 00:17:11.740
lines remind you of?
 

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:14.910
They are meant to remind you of
something.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:17.180
The very beginning of
Inferno.

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:23.157
Very good--which means that
this is now really a new

00:17:23.157 --> 00:17:28.126
departure for him,
which means that the Garden of

00:17:28.126 --> 00:17:31.890
Eden is exactly the wilderness
that we saw--

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:35.183
that we left behind,
seen from a different

00:17:35.183 --> 00:17:37.664
perspective,
which means that the

00:17:37.664 --> 00:17:41.430
supernatural world is the
natural world with a different--

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:44.818
to a different lens and
different perspective.

00:17:44.818 --> 00:17:51.515
This is--and is now re-enacting
exactly the drama of

00:17:51.515 --> 00:17:54.900
Inferno I;
it's no shipwreck.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.818
The mountain has been climbed.
 

00:17:56.818 --> 00:17:58.640
Remember that he tried to climb
the mountain?

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.868
The mountain has been climbed.
 

00:17:59.868 --> 00:18:02.598
A new departure is going to
take place.

00:18:02.598 --> 00:18:07.068
Here we go then with this idea
of the--

00:18:07.068 --> 00:18:10.617
that's what I mean the
anti-pastoral Dante:

00:18:10.617 --> 00:18:13.828
the poet who dismisses and
refuses,

00:18:13.828 --> 00:18:18.460
and repudiates all the
temptations of gardens,

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:22.558
all the temptations of
premature halting,

00:18:22.558 --> 00:18:27.390
premature self-enclosure into
the fiction of gardens.

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.714
So this is really the strongest
element that I would have to

00:18:30.714 --> 00:18:33.589
point out about what's happening
in Canto XXVIII.

00:18:33.589 --> 00:18:34.670
Now what does he see?
 

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.895
"All the waters that are
purest here would seem to have

00:18:37.895 --> 00:18:40.029
some defilement in them beside
that,

00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:43.923
which conceals nothing,
though it flows quite dark

00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:48.482
under the perpetual shade,
which never lets sun or moon

00:18:48.482 --> 00:18:49.529
shine there.
 

00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:52.811
With feet I stopped and with
eyes passed over beyond the

00:18:52.811 --> 00:18:56.153
streamlet to look at the great
variety of fresh flowering

00:18:56.153 --> 00:18:59.605
boughs,
and there appeared to me,"

00:18:59.605 --> 00:19:02.480
and the word,
now, is really with a power and

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.163
force of an apparition,
another epiphany of beauty and

00:19:06.163 --> 00:19:09.403
love to him,
"as appears of a sudden a

00:19:09.403 --> 00:19:13.328
thing that for wonder drives
away every other thought,

00:19:13.328 --> 00:19:16.903
a lady all alone,
who went singing and culling

00:19:16.903 --> 00:19:21.828
flower from flower from which
all her way was painted."

00:19:21.828 --> 00:19:24.276
This is Matelda,
as you have read,

00:19:24.276 --> 00:19:28.798
the woman who goes dancing,
singing, and gathering flowers.

00:19:28.798 --> 00:19:34.750
A true picture a fascination,
aesthetic fascination for him.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:40.490
To give you the sense of how
some resonance--

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.509
and in case you're stilling for
a term that--

00:19:43.509 --> 00:19:47.160
the final paper topic you might
want to read--

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.682
there is a poem--there is a
traditional poetry which is

00:19:51.682 --> 00:19:56.038
really Provençal called
pastourelle.

00:19:56.038 --> 00:20:02.380
The pastourelle was--a
big practitioner is Dante here.

00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.380
That's what he's writing.
 

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:07.484
It's the idea of the knight who
goes to the woods or the meadow

00:20:07.484 --> 00:20:13.711
and meets a young shepherdess--
gets off--it's very sensual,

00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:17.506
and woos--
off the horse and woos this

00:20:17.506 --> 00:20:21.837
young woman and usually ends
with a kind of pun on the

00:20:21.837 --> 00:20:25.190
promises of the ecstasies of
paradise.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.269
So it's an erotic kind of song.
 

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:33.942
The other practitioner of this
genre was Dante's own friend,

00:20:33.942 --> 00:20:35.769
Guido Cavalcanti.
 

00:20:35.769 --> 00:20:40.183
Dante is using the mode and
really definitely taking his

00:20:40.183 --> 00:20:41.789
distance from him.
 

00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:43.410
There is--this is a love scene.
 

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.779
There's nothing of the
overtones of violence--

00:20:46.779 --> 00:20:50.861
an erotic violence--that Guido
Cavalcanti had celebrated in his

00:20:50.861 --> 00:20:53.559
own version of the
pastourelle,

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:56.779
a genre which is common to them.
 

00:20:56.779 --> 00:20:59.942
This instead is what he says:
"Pray, fair lady,

00:20:59.942 --> 00:21:02.608
who warmest thyself in love's
beam."

00:21:02.608 --> 00:21:05.640
Now Dante has just come out of
the circle of lust.

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:11.615
He has been cleansing himself
and yet, this is the lingering

00:21:11.615 --> 00:21:16.375
trace of his history,
the lingering trace of his

00:21:16.375 --> 00:21:19.108
body, and his humanity.
 

00:21:19.108 --> 00:21:24.307
Here he goes through the Garden
of Eden as a fallen man who is

00:21:24.307 --> 00:21:29.561
redeemed and not quite redeemed,
certainly not in the restored

00:21:29.561 --> 00:21:34.420
or reinstated into the innocence
of the pre-lapsarian garden.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.210
"If I am to believe the
looks which are wont to be

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:39.380
testimony of the heart,' I said
to her,

00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.339
'may it please thee to come
forward to this stream so near

00:21:42.339 --> 00:21:44.210
that I may hear what thou
singest.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:48.548
Thou makest me recall where and
what was Proserpina,

00:21:48.548 --> 00:21:51.920
at the time her mother,"
Ceres,

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:55.190
"lost her and she is
praying."

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:58.230
That's the first--there is a
series of three mythological

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.750
images, this is the first.
 

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.151
I think of you as Proserpina,
but it's also a story of

00:22:03.151 --> 00:22:04.818
Proserpina, as you know.
 

00:22:04.818 --> 00:22:08.498
Well it's stated in the text:
the story of the young woman

00:22:08.498 --> 00:22:12.345
who is walking--
picking flowers on the plains

00:22:12.345 --> 00:22:17.808
of Enna in Sicily and then death
comes and takes her away.

00:22:17.808 --> 00:22:22.959
It's a kind of death itself,
loving human beings and taking

00:22:22.959 --> 00:22:25.088
them, that's one myth.
 

00:22:25.088 --> 00:22:28.329
The second one is "a lady
turns in the dance with feet

00:22:28.329 --> 00:22:30.230
close together"
and so on,

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.161
and I skip a few lines:
"And I do not believe such

00:22:33.161 --> 00:22:35.930
light shone from beneath the
lids of Venus when,

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:38.986
through strange mischance,
she was pierced by her

00:22:38.986 --> 00:22:39.750
son."
 

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:41.740
The second image,
I think, it's more telling.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:46.338
It's the story of Venus wounded
by the arrows of Cupid and

00:22:46.338 --> 00:22:48.680
falling in love with Cupid.
 

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.789
I think it's more telling
because it's Dante's way of

00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:54.663
casting,
without going into

00:22:54.663 --> 00:22:57.400
psychoanalysis--a
psychoanalytical explanation--

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:02.132
that Dante is casting the
Garden of Eden as also a desire

00:23:02.132 --> 00:23:06.694
to return to the state of
infancy of the child with the

00:23:06.694 --> 00:23:09.943
mother,
only to understand that this is

00:23:09.943 --> 00:23:13.259
really a fantasy that would lead
him nowhere.

00:23:13.259 --> 00:23:16.989
And in fact,
the third image is that of an

00:23:16.989 --> 00:23:20.808
erotic image again,
but one of distance.

00:23:20.808 --> 00:23:22.828
"Three paces the river
kept us apart;

00:23:22.828 --> 00:23:24.750
the Hellespont where Xerxes
passed,

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:26.838
a bridle still on all men's
boasts,

00:23:26.838 --> 00:23:30.778
did bear more hatred from
Leander for its swelling waters

00:23:30.778 --> 00:23:35.207
between Sestos and Abydos,
than that from me because it

00:23:35.207 --> 00:23:37.338
did not open then."
 

00:23:37.338 --> 00:23:44.068
So, this barrier between
Matelda and the pilgrim.

00:23:44.068 --> 00:23:48.584
Between Dante and the fantasy
of what the Garden of Eden may

00:23:48.584 --> 00:23:50.880
be, the mother here is kept.
 

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.670
And Dante has to continue.
 

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:57.930
He goes on explain--she goes on
explaining what this--

00:23:57.930 --> 00:24:03.690
how the mechanics,
so to say, about the Garden of

00:24:03.690 --> 00:24:07.890
Eden and then the canto ends
in--

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:11.390
and I'll look at this from
lines 140 and following.

00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:15.250
"Those,"
line 140 and following,

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.528
"Those who in old times
sang of the age of gold and of

00:24:19.528 --> 00:24:22.941
its happy state,
perhaps dreamed on Parnassus of

00:24:22.941 --> 00:24:26.776
this place;
here the human root was

00:24:26.776 --> 00:24:33.288
innocent, here was lasting
spring and every fruit,

00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:38.868
this is the nectar of which
each tells.

00:24:38.868 --> 00:24:42.529
I turned then right round to my
poets and saw that they had

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:44.990
heard the last sentence with a
smile.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.308
Then I brought my eyes back to
the fair lady."

00:24:48.308 --> 00:24:52.378
From Dante's point of view,
the perplexity that he feels,

00:24:52.378 --> 00:24:56.740
is the perplexity of Virgil and
the perplexity of Statius.

00:24:56.740 --> 00:25:01.278
They know no more than he does;
he knows no more than they do.

00:25:01.278 --> 00:25:05.650
What is the other--the burden
of this passage is that the--

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:11.415
clearly Dante is alluding to
the bucolic quality of this

00:25:11.415 --> 00:25:14.488
place,
but it also suggests that in

00:25:14.488 --> 00:25:19.051
passing that the ancient--
actually, he says that the

00:25:19.051 --> 00:25:24.656
ancient poets prefigured the
Garden of Eden in the fabulous

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:29.200
visions of the golden age and
the Parnassus.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.019
He's establishing a link
between the poetic visions and

00:25:34.019 --> 00:25:38.304
this encounter that he has in
the Garden of Eden,

00:25:38.304 --> 00:25:42.500
both projections of the poetic
imagination.

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:48.220
So it also means that the
Garden of Eden can be like the

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:52.900
bucolic fantasy of the poets and
Parnassus.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:56.048
We skip XXIX which is the story
of--

00:25:56.048 --> 00:25:59.558
really the world history here
from--

00:25:59.558 --> 00:26:05.152
it's an allegory that pageant
of revelation and I will move to

00:26:05.152 --> 00:26:09.920
Canto XXX which will take us a
little bit of time.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.689
This is the canto predictably
where--since Beatrice is the one

00:26:14.689 --> 00:26:19.144
who is linked to the number
three, this is the canto where

00:26:19.144 --> 00:26:21.098
Beatrice will arrive.
 

00:26:21.098 --> 00:26:24.662
And surprisingly,
for those of you who are lovers

00:26:24.662 --> 00:26:28.150
of this open or hidden symmetry
in the poem,

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:32.575
Canto XXX of Paradise is
also the canto where Beatrice

00:26:32.575 --> 00:26:33.828
will disappear.
 

00:26:33.828 --> 00:26:38.210
Her residence in the poem lasts
for exactly XXXIII cantos.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:41.269
Clearly it's sort of an
accident: her name is three

00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:43.693
times the good;
she's in the Vita nuova

00:26:43.693 --> 00:26:44.710
as linked with three.
 

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:49.907
It's this kind of way of--the
arcane significance of her

00:26:49.907 --> 00:26:54.538
presence in the pilgrim's--in
the lover's life.

00:26:54.538 --> 00:26:59.410
A canto that describes a double
drama,

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:04.097
the drama of Virgil's
disappearance and the arrival of

00:27:04.097 --> 00:27:06.881
Beatrice,
a change of the guard as it

00:27:06.881 --> 00:27:09.401
were, in many ways,
but you have two different

00:27:09.401 --> 00:27:09.720
moods.
 

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:17.435
One of elegy for the loss of
Virgil and the other one of

00:27:17.435 --> 00:27:23.470
sacred terror at the arrival of
Beatrice.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:26.431
So it begins,
he hears singing,

00:27:26.431 --> 00:27:30.182
line 70: Veni,
sponsa de Libano,

00:27:30.182 --> 00:27:34.525
which, of course,
is an echo from the Song of

00:27:34.525 --> 00:27:35.710
Songs.
 

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:39.818
So the erotics of the previous
canto continues now here.

00:27:39.818 --> 00:27:45.019
The Song of Songs is
notoriously one of a sublime

00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:46.318
love poem.
 

00:27:46.318 --> 00:27:52.667
It continues here in Canto XXX
in anticipation of the arrival

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:54.150
of Beatrice.
 

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.759
"As the blessed shall rise
at the last trump,

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:59.717
each eager for his tomb,
the reclad voice singing

00:27:59.717 --> 00:28:02.104
Hallelujah,
there rose up on the divine

00:28:02.104 --> 00:28:04.588
chariot at the voice of so great
an elder,

00:28:04.588 --> 00:28:07.868
a hundred ministers and
messengers of eternal life,

00:28:07.868 --> 00:28:10.644
who all cried:
'Benedictus qui

00:28:10.644 --> 00:28:14.872
venis.'"
This is now an allusion,

00:28:14.872 --> 00:28:18.608
as maybe your notes will tell
you--

00:28:18.608 --> 00:28:23.337
should tell you--to the
greetings of Jesus in the garden

00:28:23.337 --> 00:28:26.971
when he comes--
I'm sorry--to Jerusalem and he

00:28:26.971 --> 00:28:29.491
says,
'Benedictus qui venit,'

00:28:29.491 --> 00:28:32.930
which means that Beatrice--
it means a number of things.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:35.400
First of all,
a typological connection

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.740
between garden and city which we
have already been seeing here.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:42.515
The garden is not opposed to
the political,

00:28:42.515 --> 00:28:45.686
let's say, to the city,
it is the history and the

00:28:45.686 --> 00:28:48.858
garden come together in Dante's
imagination.

00:28:48.858 --> 00:28:53.065
But there is a further typology
that Beatrice comes the way

00:28:53.065 --> 00:28:54.950
Jesus came into history.
 

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:58.500
Beatrice will come into the
soul of the lover.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.595
So that she is surrounded,
she is wrapped in a kind of

00:29:02.595 --> 00:29:06.537
aura of Christological language
and she will become,

00:29:06.537 --> 00:29:10.432
let's say, grace;
the way one can experience

00:29:10.432 --> 00:29:15.240
grace in the world through this
kind of direct love onto

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.598
oneself, so Latin again.
 

00:29:17.598 --> 00:29:20.880
Then, a third image,
and throwing flowers up around,

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.297
"Manibus o date lilia
plenis,"

00:29:24.297 --> 00:29:26.750
another three phrases in Latin.
 

00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:28.509
He will go on translating a
fourth one.

00:29:28.509 --> 00:29:32.221
This is a more interesting
image because it's taken

00:29:32.221 --> 00:29:34.970
straight out of the
Aeneid--

00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:37.720
of Book VI of Virgil's
Aeneid--

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.131
so it's already an homage to
Virgil who is about to

00:29:42.131 --> 00:29:43.190
disappear.
 

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:46.108
Do you see how the dramas here
are sort of interwoven?

00:29:46.108 --> 00:29:50.435
The idea of what the garden is
and how is the garden related to

00:29:50.435 --> 00:29:52.598
oneself and to one's history.
 

00:29:52.598 --> 00:29:57.156
The idea of--the arrival and
the meaning of Beatrice into the

00:29:57.156 --> 00:30:01.411
life of the pilgrim and then
also the loss of Virgil as a

00:30:01.411 --> 00:30:04.450
poet and whatever his vision may
be.

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:08.048
Whatever his vision may be is
indicated by these fragments,

00:30:08.048 --> 00:30:12.155
the fragments refer to the
premature death that Virgil

00:30:12.155 --> 00:30:17.038
celebrates in a very elegiac way
in Book VI of the Aeneid

00:30:17.038 --> 00:30:21.842
where Aeneas has gone down into
Hades in order to see the whole

00:30:21.842 --> 00:30:23.160
of history.
 

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:27.467
This is the descent into the
oracles' father and to see

00:30:27.467 --> 00:30:32.491
Anchises, that it is the future
that is going to derive and stem

00:30:32.491 --> 00:30:33.529
from him.
 

00:30:33.529 --> 00:30:39.457
And Anchises will point out to
him the shade of a young man who

00:30:39.457 --> 00:30:43.099
sits on the side,
his name is Marcellus,

00:30:43.099 --> 00:30:46.720
who will die too young and then
he will add,

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.506
"all throw lilies with
open hands,"

00:30:50.506 --> 00:30:55.670
the lily being a funereal
symbol like the chrysanthemums,

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:58.179
for instance,
or some such things in some

00:30:58.179 --> 00:30:58.868
cultures.
 

00:30:58.868 --> 00:31:02.874
It's an image of a premature
death which clearly is linked

00:31:02.874 --> 00:31:06.694
also to Beatrice,
but who died in a premature

00:31:06.694 --> 00:31:11.151
death, but also to Virgil,
because it's the anticipation

00:31:11.151 --> 00:31:12.700
of the loss of Virgil.
 

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.298
It's an elegiac way.
 

00:31:14.298 --> 00:31:20.121
It is as if Virgil's vision was
under the aegis of mortality and

00:31:20.121 --> 00:31:23.722
finitude,
as if Virgil could never really

00:31:23.722 --> 00:31:28.470
be thought of as saved because
his song is a song limited to

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:30.240
the world of death.
 

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:33.518
Let's see how this continues,
"I once saw at the

00:31:33.518 --> 00:31:37.426
beginning of the day the eastern
parts all rosy and the rest of

00:31:37.426 --> 00:31:40.957
the sky clear and beautiful and
the sun's face come forth

00:31:40.957 --> 00:31:41.525
shaded...
 

00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:42.660
" etc.
 

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.362
"...
 

00:31:43.362 --> 00:31:46.875
a lady appeared to me,"
this is Beatrice,

00:31:46.875 --> 00:31:50.700
"girt with olive over a
white veil."

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.910
Look at her elegance.
 

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:59.200
Listen to how he describes the
colors, the fashions.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:03.701
"Girt with olive over a
white veil, clothed under a

00:32:03.701 --> 00:32:07.630
green mantle with the color of a
living flame.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:11.027
And my spirit,"
I call that the Italian flag by

00:32:11.027 --> 00:32:13.326
the way,
the way she seems to be the

00:32:13.326 --> 00:32:15.904
red, white and green,
"and my spirit,

00:32:15.904 --> 00:32:19.078
which now so long had not been
overcome with awe,

00:32:19.078 --> 00:32:22.144
trembling in her presence,
without having more knowledge

00:32:22.144 --> 00:32:24.596
by the eyes,
through hidden virtue that came

00:32:24.596 --> 00:32:27.875
from her,
felt old love's great

00:32:27.875 --> 00:32:29.548
power."
 

00:32:29.548 --> 00:32:33.750
This is a rewriting of the poem
of the autobiography of Dante

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:37.318
that you remember,
reading the Vita nuova.

00:32:37.318 --> 00:32:42.083
He's experiencing the presence
of Beatrice through exactly the

00:32:42.083 --> 00:32:46.690
kind of effects that she has
over him: the courtly love,

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.240
the sweet new style,
the trembling,

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.670
the inability to speak.
 

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.826
"As soon as the lofty
virtue smote on my sight which

00:32:53.826 --> 00:32:57.038
already had pierced me before I
was out of my boyhood,

00:32:57.038 --> 00:33:00.179
I turned to the left with the
confidence of a little child

00:33:00.179 --> 00:33:03.430
that runs to his mother when
he's afraid or in distress,

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:06.174
to say to Virgil:
'Not a drop of blood is left in

00:33:06.174 --> 00:33:07.720
me that does not tremble.
 

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:11.358
I know the marks of the ancient
flame."

00:33:11.358 --> 00:33:18.028
He's scared and turns to Virgil
and is about to say,

00:33:18.028 --> 00:33:22.290
and will say the famous lines,
"I know the marks of the

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.829
ancient flame,"
which is a translation of the

00:33:25.829 --> 00:33:29.586
words Dido will speak when she
meets Aeneas in Hades:

00:33:29.586 --> 00:33:33.125
"I know the marks of the
ancient flame,"

00:33:33.125 --> 00:33:36.736
another image of death and
mortality taken from the

00:33:36.736 --> 00:33:38.470
Aeneid.
 

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:43.752
Dante's linking Virgil with
that kind of metaphor and that

00:33:43.752 --> 00:33:46.720
sort of limitation of passion.
 

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.838
"But Virgil had left us
bereft of him,

00:33:49.838 --> 00:33:52.612
Virgil sweetest father,
Virgil to whom I gave myself

00:33:52.612 --> 00:33:55.209
for my salvation,
nor did all the ancient mother

00:33:55.209 --> 00:33:58.178
lost avail my cheeks washed with
dew that they should not be

00:33:58.178 --> 00:33:59.890
stained again with tears."
 

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:03.819
These are Beatrice's first
words: "Dante,

00:34:03.819 --> 00:34:08.101
because Virgil leaves thee weep
not, weep not yet,

00:34:08.101 --> 00:34:11.768
for thou must weep for another
sword.'

00:34:11.768 --> 00:34:14.090
Like an admiral who goes to
poop and prow to see the men

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.496
that serve on the other ships
and to hearten them in their

00:34:16.496 --> 00:34:18.739
work,
so on the left side of the

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:21.889
car--when I turned at the sound
of my name,

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:25.139
which is noted here of
necessity--I saw the lady who

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:28.516
first appeared to me veiled
under the angelic festival

00:34:28.516 --> 00:34:31.320
direct her eyes on me beyond the
stream.

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.489
Already the veil that fell from
her head,

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:36.166
and circled with Minerva's
leaves, did not let her be

00:34:36.166 --> 00:34:38.784
plainly seen,
royally, still stern in her

00:34:38.784 --> 00:34:41.266
bearing,
she continued like one who

00:34:41.266 --> 00:34:44.342
while he speaks holds back his
hottest words:

00:34:44.342 --> 00:34:49.010
'Look at me well;
I am, I am indeed Beatrice.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.230
How durst thou approach the
mountain?

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:56.099
Didst thou not know that here
man is happy?"

00:34:56.099 --> 00:35:02.119
Well a number of things
here--Virgil has disappeared.

00:35:02.119 --> 00:35:05.099
Dante now is alone,
so that's what I call the

00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:07.469
self-confrontation with his
past.

00:35:07.469 --> 00:35:08.909
Who is Beatrice?
 

00:35:08.909 --> 00:35:13.969
How am I going to account for
my failings to Beatrice?

00:35:13.969 --> 00:35:17.079
What is she going to expect of
me?

00:35:17.079 --> 00:35:20.679
She's harsh,
the harsh language of love,

00:35:20.679 --> 00:35:23.518
to the point if I may be a
little bit too--

00:35:23.518 --> 00:35:26.840
without really lessening the
intensity of this passage,

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:31.132
this passage is pretty intense,
but I feel that I have to tell

00:35:31.132 --> 00:35:33.702
you a little--
to distract you a little bit

00:35:33.702 --> 00:35:34.579
for ten seconds.
 

00:35:34.579 --> 00:35:41.552
Borges has written about this
passage, a beautiful essay on

00:35:41.552 --> 00:35:47.443
this scene and he says,
this is the only time that

00:35:47.443 --> 00:35:51.289
Dante really made a mistake.
 

00:35:51.289 --> 00:35:55.730
Because if Beatrice spoke to me
the way he spoke--

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:58.619
she spoke to Virgil--to
Dante--I'm sorry--

00:35:58.619 --> 00:36:02.396
I would have said to her,
look if that's the way you feel

00:36:02.396 --> 00:36:06.599
I'm going to go right back and--
but Dante won't say that.

00:36:06.599 --> 00:36:11.275
This is a contemporary
visionary like Borges,

00:36:11.275 --> 00:36:12.550
not Dante.
 

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.965
What we are told is that this
is the first,

00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:20.275
and only, time in the poem that
Dante's name is heard.

00:36:20.275 --> 00:36:21.090
Dante.
 

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:23.996
She will never call him Dante
again and he has never been

00:36:23.996 --> 00:36:25.139
called Dante before.
 

00:36:25.139 --> 00:36:28.460
In other words,
this the point where the poem,

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:31.980
from the epic that it has been,
the epic of desire,

00:36:31.980 --> 00:36:34.773
the epic of hope,
the pilgrim,

00:36:34.773 --> 00:36:40.400
lost the longing and memory,
between hope and memory,

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:45.219
the poem of justice,
now it becomes an autobiography.

00:36:45.219 --> 00:36:47.949
Now it is his own story.
 

00:36:47.949 --> 00:36:51.048
There is a shift in genre:
from an epic story:

00:36:51.048 --> 00:36:53.666
from the loss of Virgil,
the epic poet,

00:36:53.666 --> 00:36:55.940
to an autobiographical focus.
 

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.550
Dante, this is you,
the specificity and

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.230
irreducibility of his own
experience.

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:07.085
Dante, she says,
and he will add that his name

00:37:07.085 --> 00:37:12.030
is here registered out of
necessity.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.710
And what is the necessity that
he has?

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:17.800
What's the necessity about
speaking of oneself?

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.659
Why would one go on speaking of
oneself?

00:37:20.659 --> 00:37:27.050
One speaks of oneself because
one wants to be exemplary to

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.059
others.
 

00:37:28.059 --> 00:37:32.501
One believes that what one has
experienced is crucial for

00:37:32.501 --> 00:37:37.498
somebody else's self knowledge,
somebody else's experience or

00:37:37.498 --> 00:37:41.619
one wants to exempt vituperation
from his own name.

00:37:41.619 --> 00:37:43.989
It's--I'm paraphrasing Dante's
words,

00:37:43.989 --> 00:37:48.362
and the way he registers them
in this philosophical text that

00:37:48.362 --> 00:37:50.635
he writes called,
the Banquet,

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:52.179
where he speaks of-- about
himself.

00:37:52.179 --> 00:37:54.677
And he says,
there are two people who have

00:37:54.677 --> 00:37:57.360
spoken about themselves in
exemplary ways.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.579
One is Augustine in the
Confessions,

00:37:59.579 --> 00:38:02.780
a book that I have asked you
repeatedly to read and I have

00:38:02.780 --> 00:38:04.987
read from,
and the other one is Boethius

00:38:04.987 --> 00:38:08.250
that I have alluded to in The
Consolation of Philosophy.

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:11.528
The philosopher,
who is in jail,

00:38:11.528 --> 00:38:17.771
seeks to find comfort to the
imputations of criminal conduct

00:38:17.771 --> 00:38:21.239
laid on him,
by thinking about philosophy

00:38:21.239 --> 00:38:23.742
and talking about himself,
and whereas,

00:38:23.742 --> 00:38:26.657
Augustine, of course,
is discussing his own

00:38:26.657 --> 00:38:27.630
conversion.
 

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:32.103
The idea of the necessity is
both--Dante is alluding to two

00:38:32.103 --> 00:38:36.385
autobiographical texts,
both of which make it

00:38:36.385 --> 00:38:40.289
the--talking about oneself
indeed,

00:38:40.289 --> 00:38:43.059
as he calls it, a necessity.
 

00:38:43.059 --> 00:38:48.590
So this now will continue with
Canto XXX.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:53.485
The first thing that she will
do--Beatrice will do--and we

00:38:53.485 --> 00:38:55.289
turn to Canto XXXI.
 

00:38:55.289 --> 00:39:01.016
There's an account--and Canto
XXX continues with the story of

00:39:01.016 --> 00:39:07.030
his failures when she died as
told in the Vita nuova,

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.920
he went on looking for someone
who could replace Beatrice.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:15.166
And now Dante goes on
asking--actually indulging in a

00:39:15.166 --> 00:39:17.887
confession,
literally an Augustinian

00:39:17.887 --> 00:39:21.572
moment, another part of the
autobiographical moment and a

00:39:21.572 --> 00:39:27.195
confessional form and this is--
let me just read a few lines

00:39:27.195 --> 00:39:30.219
here, before we move on.
 

00:39:30.219 --> 00:39:34.179
"Oh thou that art on that
side of the sacred river,' she

00:39:34.179 --> 00:39:36.932
began again,
turning against me the point of

00:39:36.932 --> 00:39:40.460
her speech which even with the
edge that seemed sharp to me and

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:44.159
continuing without pause,
'say, say if this is true;

00:39:44.159 --> 00:39:47.963
to such an accusation thy
confession must needs be

00:39:47.963 --> 00:39:48.739
joined.'
 

00:39:48.739 --> 00:39:52.534
My faculties were so confounded
that my voice began and was

00:39:52.534 --> 00:39:55.610
spent before it was released
from its organs.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:59.164
She forebore a little,
then said, 'What thinkest

00:39:59.164 --> 00:40:02.753
thou?"--
A phrase that should remind

00:40:02.753 --> 00:40:08.570
you--I know that it's too little
and I will not too demanding,

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:13.199
but it should remind you of the
fact that this is Francesca's,

00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:18.090
this is what Dante was asking
Francesca in Canto 5.

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:21.159
And now it's Beatrice--the
roles are inverted--

00:40:21.159 --> 00:40:25.945
who is asking Dante to resume
as if it were that confession of

00:40:25.945 --> 00:40:29.949
a failing that Francesca had
undergone in Canto V of

00:40:29.949 --> 00:40:31.440
Inferno.
 

00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:33.599
"What thinkest thou?
 

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:37.487
Answer me, for the sad memories
are not yet destroyed in thee by

00:40:37.487 --> 00:40:38.289
the water.'
 

00:40:38.289 --> 00:40:41.724
Confusion and fear mingled
together drove forth from my

00:40:41.724 --> 00:40:45.480
mouth a Yes such that to hear it
there was need of sight.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:48.686
As a crossbow shot with too
great strain breaks the

00:40:48.686 --> 00:40:52.000
cord,"
let me just go on.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.268
"After,"
with line 36,

00:40:54.268 --> 00:40:56.369
"After heaving a bitter
sigh,

00:40:56.369 --> 00:40:59.929
I had--I had hardly the voice
to answer and the lips shaped it

00:40:59.929 --> 00:41:02.282
with difficulty;
weeping, I said:

00:41:02.282 --> 00:41:06.844
'Present things with their
false pleasure turned my steps

00:41:06.844 --> 00:41:09.940
as soon as your face was
hid."

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.251
The--he's alluding,
exactly as he did in the

00:41:14.251 --> 00:41:19.065
Vita nuova,
to his change of heart as soon

00:41:19.065 --> 00:41:23.480
as Beatrice died,
and now she continues.

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.541
"And she:
'Hadst thou kept silence or

00:41:25.541 --> 00:41:28.884
denied what thou confessest,
thy fault would be not less

00:41:28.884 --> 00:41:31.329
plain, by such a judge as it
known,

00:41:31.329 --> 00:41:35.559
but when from a man's own cheek
breaks forth condemnation of his

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:37.880
sin,
in our court the wheel turns

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.400
back against the edge.
 

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.135
Nevertheless,
in order that thou mayst now

00:41:42.135 --> 00:41:46.739
bear the shame of thy wandering,
and another time hearing the

00:41:46.739 --> 00:41:48.371
Sirens,
be stronger,

00:41:48.371 --> 00:41:51.849
lay aside the sowing of tears,
and hearken;

00:41:51.849 --> 00:41:55.018
so shalt thou hear how my
buried flesh should have

00:41:55.018 --> 00:41:56.960
directed thee the other way.
 

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.097
Never did nature or art set
before thee beauty so great as

00:42:00.097 --> 00:42:01.750
the fair members,"
etc.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:08.612
The passage is extraordinary
because it helps us to gloss

00:42:08.612 --> 00:42:15.353
retrospectively what was a
fairly mysterious allegory in

00:42:15.353 --> 00:42:17.070
Purgatory.
 

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:21.043
You remember,
where Dante meets the siren,

00:42:21.043 --> 00:42:25.889
or dreams of the siren and then
a lady appeared?

00:42:25.889 --> 00:42:30.583
The siren was an allegory of a
temptation, an erotic

00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:31.780
temptation.
 

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:36.487
Someone who wants to lure the
pilgrim and promises happiness.

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:37.349
Remember?
 

00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:42.320
I'm going to make you happy,
you need to go nowhere else and

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.592
now--
and then there was also the

00:42:45.592 --> 00:42:49.070
appearance of a mysterious
woman,

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:56.670
an equally mysterious woman who
manages to send away the siren.

00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:02.360
She wakes up the pilgrim and
the journey there can continue.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.855
As you recall,
we are saying,

00:43:03.855 --> 00:43:06.365
well we don't know who this
mysterious woman is,

00:43:06.365 --> 00:43:08.449
though there are a number of
hints.

00:43:08.449 --> 00:43:12.257
I had read this part of the
poem before you had,

00:43:12.257 --> 00:43:14.690
probably, and it's Beatrice.
 

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:18.242
Beatrice was a kind of--an
allegory of the confrontation of

00:43:18.242 --> 00:43:20.385
two women,
the siren on the one hand,

00:43:20.385 --> 00:43:22.929
and on the other hand,
this unknown,

00:43:22.929 --> 00:43:25.030
mysterious Beatrice.
 

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:28.730
Now this scene just makes it
clear,

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:32.510
because what Beatrice says,
you have to make a confession

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.722
in case shame,
"Now bear the shame of thy

00:43:34.722 --> 00:43:36.920
wanderings and another time,
hearing the Sirens,

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.445
be stronger,
lay aside the sowing of tears

00:43:39.445 --> 00:43:41.507
and hearken;
so shalt thou hear how my

00:43:41.507 --> 00:43:42.920
buried flesh,"
and so on.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:47.853
She is now glossing the scene
of the siren that appeared in

00:43:47.853 --> 00:43:51.000
Canto XIX, but there is more to
it.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.380
There is a little phrase that
Dante's using,

00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:58.365
or Beatrice is using for him:
"another time,"

00:43:58.365 --> 00:44:01.851
when you hear the siren,
which means that the siren is

00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:04.530
not just the encounter with the
siren.

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:08.599
It's not just an event that
happened in the past.

00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:12.289
It can happen all over again.
 

00:44:12.289 --> 00:44:12.989
"Another time."
 

00:44:12.989 --> 00:44:15.096
In other words,
it can still happen in the

00:44:15.096 --> 00:44:17.309
future,
which means that Dante's

00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:19.775
conversion,
which is really what this poem

00:44:19.775 --> 00:44:22.775
has been telling us--
especially now that it has

00:44:22.775 --> 00:44:26.219
reached this kind of
autobiographical quality--

00:44:26.219 --> 00:44:31.039
is not over and done with,
that it is a conversion.

00:44:31.039 --> 00:44:35.202
It has to be understood as an
ongoing journey and that the

00:44:35.202 --> 00:44:38.489
future itself is fraught with
temptations,

00:44:38.489 --> 00:44:42.610
just as much as it was fraught
with temptations in the past.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:48.186
What Dante is changing is the
Augustinian idea of a conversion

00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:52.849
that takes place once and for
all and is making--

00:44:52.849 --> 00:44:56.550
it is replacing that paradigm
with a different paradigm,

00:44:56.550 --> 00:45:00.789
a paradigm of a conversion in
its openness to time,

00:45:00.789 --> 00:45:04.070
with the idea that it is an
ongoing process.

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:07.960
You have--look what the poetic
technique--

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:11.570
as Dante is remembering a scene
of the past and glossing that,

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:13.514
the encounter,
the temptation of the siren

00:45:13.514 --> 00:45:17.018
moved away,
dispelled by the arrival of

00:45:17.018 --> 00:45:18.070
Beatrice.
 

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:21.039
Now Beatrice is talking once
again about the siren,

00:45:21.039 --> 00:45:22.909
"another time,"
meaning,

00:45:22.909 --> 00:45:25.739
I know who she was in Canto XIX
of--

00:45:25.739 --> 00:45:29.369
in the dream of Canto XIX--she
may come back again.

00:45:29.369 --> 00:45:32.228
In other words,
once again, this is the

00:45:32.228 --> 00:45:35.239
anti-pastoral imagination of the
poet.

00:45:35.239 --> 00:45:39.300
Do not believe that you can
ever stop on the way.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:43.581
Do not ever believe that there
are truths that are going to be

00:45:43.581 --> 00:45:46.039
unchallenged or untested in
time.

00:45:46.039 --> 00:45:51.106
I think that this is a way of
truly casting Dante for what he

00:45:51.106 --> 00:45:54.652
is;
the poet of--open to the power

00:45:54.652 --> 00:46:00.793
of the future and drawn to the
idea that the future is still

00:46:00.793 --> 00:46:03.500
part of his experience.
 

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:06.559
By the way, he goes on,
which would really takes us--

00:46:06.559 --> 00:46:10.802
but that's the essential point,
"Truly that thou,"

00:46:10.802 --> 00:46:13.293
this is line 55,
"thou oughtest,

00:46:13.293 --> 00:46:15.599
at the first shaft of deceptive
things,

00:46:15.599 --> 00:46:18.849
to have risen up after me who
was such no longer.

00:46:18.849 --> 00:46:22.902
No young girl or other vanity
of such brief worth should have

00:46:22.902 --> 00:46:26.010
bent thy wings downward to await
more shots.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:29.056
A young chick waits for two or
three, but in vain is the net

00:46:29.056 --> 00:46:30.400
spread,"
and so on.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:33.818
This is another,
literally, the allusion to the

00:46:33.818 --> 00:46:38.800
poems that Dante wrote for what
he called the pargoletta,

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:45.264
the little--the young woman
that Beatrice seems to be--

00:46:45.264 --> 00:46:47.179
remind him of.
 

00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:54.409
Now we come to Canto XXXIII,
the end of Purgatory--

00:46:54.409 --> 00:46:59.885
the end of Purgatory,
where I really want to focus on

00:46:59.885 --> 00:47:03.690
one image and one image in
particular,

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:11.128
which is the image of a
prophecy that Beatrice will

00:47:11.128 --> 00:47:12.170
make.
 

00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:16.425
Beatrice--we are at the end of
time--Purgatory,

00:47:16.425 --> 00:47:20.958
and he goes on--I'm sorry,
she goes on promising a

00:47:20.958 --> 00:47:23.550
deliverer who will come.
 

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:28.380
The argument now is no longer
about Dante himself;

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:30.650
it's an argument about history.
 

00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:34.380
Is there a deliverance for
history?

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:39.646
Is it possible for the whole
human family to go back to a

00:47:39.646 --> 00:47:42.775
condition that,
at least if not the Garden of

00:47:42.775 --> 00:47:45.416
Eden as such,
from the point of view which we

00:47:45.416 --> 00:47:48.900
can see,
at least the towers of the true

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:51.538
city,
that's the way Dante calls it

00:47:51.538 --> 00:47:54.349
in the political tract
Monarchia.

00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:58.000
He's talking about a figure
that may enter history--

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.969
that will enter history at the
end of time,

00:47:59.969 --> 00:48:04.206
that's why I stress that
dramatically the poem is

00:48:04.206 --> 00:48:08.179
literally poised at the outer
edge of time.

00:48:08.179 --> 00:48:10.184
There's not time,
when we are going to

00:48:10.184 --> 00:48:13.619
Paradise once again,
so let me tell you what

00:48:13.619 --> 00:48:17.079
this--and we'll try to explain
it for you,

00:48:17.079 --> 00:48:20.503
lines 30 and following:
"And she said to me:

00:48:20.503 --> 00:48:24.068
'From fear and shame I would
have thee free thyself

00:48:24.068 --> 00:48:28.128
henceforth,
that thou mayst no longer speak

00:48:28.128 --> 00:48:30.199
like one that dreams.
 

00:48:30.199 --> 00:48:33.780
Know that the vessel,"
she is tough.

00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:40.516
The way she is attacking him,
she will be the teacher from

00:48:40.516 --> 00:48:43.985
now on,
"Know that the vessel the

00:48:43.985 --> 00:48:48.559
serpent broke was and is not,
but let him that has the blame

00:48:48.559 --> 00:48:51.949
be assured that God's vengeance
fears no sop.

00:48:51.949 --> 00:48:56.485
Not for all the time shall the
eagle," probably the eagle

00:48:56.485 --> 00:48:59.367
of the empire,
"be without heir that left

00:48:59.367 --> 00:49:02.079
its feathers on the car so that
it became monster,

00:49:02.079 --> 00:49:05.621
and then prey;
for I see assuredly,

00:49:05.621 --> 00:49:10.335
and therefore tell of it,
stars already near,

00:49:10.335 --> 00:49:14.503
to give us the time,
secure from all check and

00:49:14.503 --> 00:49:17.597
hindrance,
when a five hundred,

00:49:17.597 --> 00:49:21.369
ten and five,
one sent from God,

00:49:21.369 --> 00:49:26.300
shall slay the thievish woman
and the giant who sins with her.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:29.112
And perhaps my dark tale,
like Themis and the Sphinx,

00:49:29.112 --> 00:49:31.545
persuades thee less because,
in their fashion,

00:49:31.545 --> 00:49:34.929
it clouds thy mind;
but soon the facts shall be the

00:49:34.929 --> 00:49:39.137
Naiads that will solve this hard
enigma without loss of flocks

00:49:39.137 --> 00:49:40.380
and corn."
 

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:44.809
She delivers an enigma--an
enigmatic prophecy.

00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:48.038
Enigma is a word that obviously
means mystery,

00:49:48.038 --> 00:49:50.550
but it's also linked to
allegory.

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:54.190
You talk about irony, allegory;
they're all tropes that

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:58.820
grammarians place under the same
general subdivision.

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:00.840
It's an enigma.
 

00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.070
It's mysterious.
 

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:06.135
It's not quite clear,
and the lack of clarity only

00:50:06.135 --> 00:50:08.873
adds, I think,
to the fear and the

00:50:08.873 --> 00:50:12.690
speculations of course about
what this is.

00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:15.853
It's a numerical symbol,
which he says,

00:50:15.853 --> 00:50:18.849
it's a five hundred,
ten and five.

00:50:18.849 --> 00:50:21.820
That's the way it's written,
five hundred,

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:23.268
ten and five:
DXV.

00:50:23.268 --> 00:50:27.456
And you do know that
numbers--we have been talking a

00:50:27.456 --> 00:50:32.233
little bit about this,
numbers viewed as containing

00:50:32.233 --> 00:50:37.974
medieval numerical symbolism
views numbers as containing the

00:50:37.974 --> 00:50:42.449
essence of the secret actually
of creation.

00:50:42.449 --> 00:50:45.277
They would go writing--this is
Isidore of Seville,

00:50:45.277 --> 00:50:47.644
goes on writing,
take the number away from

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:50.590
things and things will perish,
will fall apart.

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:55.777
It's a Pythagorean idea,
what keeps all things together

00:50:55.777 --> 00:51:00.869
is just a sense of--call it
musical rhythmic numerical

00:51:00.869 --> 00:51:02.119
ordering.
 

00:51:02.119 --> 00:51:06.449
Of course, there are--a great
other number that maybe

00:51:06.449 --> 00:51:10.197
everybody knows is 666,
which is the number of

00:51:10.197 --> 00:51:11.530
anti-Christ.
 

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:16.443
Dante's writing a five hundred,
one, and five--what on earth

00:51:16.443 --> 00:51:17.610
could it be?
 

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:21.003
Oh the speculations I
could--they're hilarious,

00:51:21.003 --> 00:51:24.030
some of the spec--what they
could mean.

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:27.784
There are those who believe,
well it really refers to the

00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:28.590
year 1315.
 

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:31.884
We have no reason to believe
that is the case,

00:51:31.884 --> 00:51:34.960
because it's 800,
the year of Charlemagne's

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.280
declaring the Holy Roman Empire
and 515 gives you 1315.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.954
So Dante's really thinking
about an imminent event in his

00:51:41.954 --> 00:51:42.480
own time.
 

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:45.710
There's nothing in the text
that would allow us to see this

00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:47.659
and allow us to make it
credible.

00:51:47.659 --> 00:51:48.768
So what is it?
 

00:51:48.768 --> 00:51:52.050
Actually, it was found that the
way--

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.518
the best way to describe it is
really in--

00:51:54.518 --> 00:52:00.599
written in DXV in five hundred,
ten,

00:52:00.599 --> 00:52:05.166
and five that this is--the best
way to try to make any sense of

00:52:05.166 --> 00:52:08.614
this prophecy and of course,
another hilarious

00:52:08.614 --> 00:52:12.177
interpretation that I just
regale to you for your own

00:52:12.177 --> 00:52:15.329
temporary relaxation this was
immediately--

00:52:15.329 --> 00:52:21.099
became the D V X.
 

00:52:21.099 --> 00:52:24.130
Between 1923 and 1943,
this was a prophecy of

00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.920
Mussolini, of all people,
who would come and deliver the

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.610
world.
 

00:52:28.610 --> 00:52:32.409
Another ridiculous--of
course--interpretation.

00:52:32.409 --> 00:52:35.059
But it was found by some very
good--

00:52:35.059 --> 00:52:38.179
by two, simultaneously,
it's amazing--

00:52:38.179 --> 00:52:40.858
by two historians,
one actually a historian and

00:52:40.858 --> 00:52:43.654
one a literary historian,
and therefore they took two

00:52:43.654 --> 00:52:46.146
different views,
that in the medieval

00:52:46.146 --> 00:52:49.407
illustrations,
there is a moment--By the way,

00:52:49.407 --> 00:52:52.588
let me just preamble this,
they found it in medieval

00:52:52.588 --> 00:52:54.119
illustrations of the mass.
 

00:52:54.119 --> 00:52:58.231
There's a moment in the mass,
where there's a so-called

00:52:58.231 --> 00:53:02.820
antiphonal prayer,
the idea that Christ is coming

00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:09.001
sacramentally and they have 'it
is truly right and just' and in

00:53:09.001 --> 00:53:13.190
Latin veridignum et justus
est,

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:17.590
and it's always written like
this and they explain V and X,

00:53:17.590 --> 00:53:20.389
a cross that joins the human
and the divine.

00:53:20.389 --> 00:53:25.186
So that really the prayer,
or the enigma of Beatrice,

00:53:25.186 --> 00:53:28.599
is for the apocalyptic end of
time.

00:53:28.599 --> 00:53:32.789
The time when Christ will
return to the earth,

00:53:32.789 --> 00:53:36.141
the first time he came,
first of all,

00:53:36.141 --> 00:53:40.610
as a human being five,
ten and five hundred.

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:44.947
The second time he will come
first in his divinity so five

00:53:44.947 --> 00:53:48.829
hundred, ten and five:
the divinity and the humanity

00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:51.190
second, the second element.
 

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:55.416
The two, humanity and divinity
join together by the X of the

00:53:55.416 --> 00:53:55.989
cross.
 

00:53:55.989 --> 00:54:00.119
A great discovery,
a number of infinite problems

00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:01.349
that I have.
 

00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:05.070
I hope I have--let me--bear
with me for a couple of minutes

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:07.699
so that I can tell you more
about this.

00:54:07.699 --> 00:54:11.110
If this is an apocalyptic
symbol, that is to say,

00:54:11.110 --> 00:54:13.280
you understand what we mean by
an apocalyptic symbol,

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.996
apocalyptic prophecy,
that for prophecy apocalypse

00:54:16.996 --> 00:54:20.940
means for visionary coming from
the Apocalypse of St.

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.960
John, and implying that Dante
believes in some kind of

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:27.010
imminent end of time.
 

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:30.099
History is coming to an end.
 

00:54:30.099 --> 00:54:33.894
If he believed in this,
and this is to be understood as

00:54:33.894 --> 00:54:37.550
an apocalyptic symbol of an
imminent end of time,

00:54:37.550 --> 00:54:41.179
this would make Dante what is
called a Joachist,

00:54:41.179 --> 00:54:43.070
and I have to explain to you
who this man is.

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:48.070
There's a man by the name of
Joachim of Flora who was--

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:50.599
and we'll see him in
Paradise,

00:54:50.599 --> 00:54:55.295
Joachim of Flora,
who had a theory of history in

00:54:55.295 --> 00:55:00.389
a kind of tripartite structure,
Joachim of Flora.

00:55:00.389 --> 00:55:06.539
The idea is that history is
patterned on the Trinity,

00:55:06.539 --> 00:55:10.306
so there is an age of the
father which roughly goes from

00:55:10.306 --> 00:55:13.730
creation to the time of the
biblical patriarchs.

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:17.586
Then there is the age of the
son that goes from the time of

00:55:17.586 --> 00:55:20.780
the incarnation to roughly 1260,
his own time.

00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.585
This is Joachim of Flora and
then there's in the age of the

00:55:23.585 --> 00:55:27.177
spirit,
that goes from the time of

00:55:27.177 --> 00:55:32.440
1260--with thanks to the
fraternal orders,

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:37.465
all structures and all
institutions will disappear and

00:55:37.465 --> 00:55:43.250
mankind will experience a time
of brotherhood and chastity.

00:55:43.250 --> 00:55:45.989
There will be no marriages,
there will be no state,

00:55:45.989 --> 00:55:50.148
there will be nothing,
and I say California is already

00:55:50.148 --> 00:55:54.385
anticipated and seen by this
great figure of Joachim of

00:55:54.385 --> 00:55:55.170
Flora.
 

00:55:55.170 --> 00:55:59.898
If Dante were a Joachist that
would create a number of

00:55:59.898 --> 00:56:03.199
problems,
because what I have just been

00:56:03.199 --> 00:56:07.583
describing to you was viewed as
a most heretical theory of

00:56:07.583 --> 00:56:08.429
history.
 

00:56:08.429 --> 00:56:09.920
Why was it heretical?
 

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.570
Because, in effect,
Joachim of Flora was,

00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:15.730
with this theory of an age of
the father,

00:56:15.730 --> 00:56:18.469
the age of the son,
and the age of the spirit--

00:56:18.469 --> 00:56:22.320
was in effect undoing the unity
of the Trinity.

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.353
That is to say,
the Trinity is no longer

00:56:24.353 --> 00:56:25.710
simultaneously together.
 

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:30.219
He's dividing the Trinity into
three distinct parts,

00:56:30.219 --> 00:56:33.570
and no less a great theologian
of Dante's own time,

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:35.750
and whom Dante will encounter
very soon in Paradise,

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:38.760
and they are going to discuss
Joachim of Flora together,

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.483
Bonaventure,
will go really writing a piece

00:56:42.483 --> 00:56:46.829
in order to declare Joachim of
Flora heretical.

00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:51.233
So if this a very powerful
explanation that Dante's really

00:56:51.233 --> 00:56:55.250
alluding to the second coming at
the end of time,

00:56:55.250 --> 00:56:59.539
the DXV, when Christ will
return to earth to restore the

00:56:59.539 --> 00:57:02.626
Messianic advent,
to restore justice to the

00:57:02.626 --> 00:57:06.291
world, and it will come first of
all in glory of the divinity

00:57:06.291 --> 00:57:09.885
first and the humanity second,
both joined by the cross,

00:57:09.885 --> 00:57:12.309
the humanity and the divinity
together.

00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:16.954
Then and--if there's not
enough--is he an apocalyptic

00:57:16.954 --> 00:57:17.760
writer?
 

00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.320
I doubt that he is an
apocalyptic writer,

00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.978
because there's no poet I know,
and I think we have given

00:57:22.978 --> 00:57:25.590
plenty of evidence of this over
the last two months,

00:57:25.590 --> 00:57:29.110
who cares more about the
institutions,

00:57:29.110 --> 00:57:32.179
who believes that the
institutions are history.

00:57:32.179 --> 00:57:36.110
And of course he attacks them
in the measuring in which he

00:57:36.110 --> 00:57:39.556
thinks that they have to be
revitalized, refreshed,

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:40.730
and improved.
 

00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:45.295
You cannot go on attacking the
institutions from--without

00:57:45.295 --> 00:57:49.860
really believing in their vital
importance in history.

00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:53.735
He talks about the Empire,
he talks about the Church,

00:57:53.735 --> 00:57:56.793
he talks about law,
he talks about family,

00:57:56.793 --> 00:57:57.389
etc.
 

00:57:57.389 --> 00:58:00.574
They're all institutions that
preserve their enduring

00:58:00.574 --> 00:58:01.369
importance.
 

00:58:01.369 --> 00:58:04.739
If he's not an apocalyptic
writer, what is he then?

00:58:04.739 --> 00:58:09.018
I think that this is an
allusion to the coming of--

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:12.820
the second coming,
but without--removing all of

00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:17.780
the Joachist paraphernalia that
accompanied that prophecy.

00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.130
This is indeed the time.
 

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:22.902
It doesn't refer to the now of
history, it refers to a time

00:58:22.902 --> 00:58:26.739
that nobody can really fathom
and nobody can really know.

00:58:26.739 --> 00:58:31.556
So I'm giving--I have given you
a reading of this passage and

00:58:31.556 --> 00:58:35.731
given you a glimpse of the
logical complications that

00:58:35.731 --> 00:58:40.789
usually accompany what it would
seem to be such a neat discovery

00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:43.760
or a neat glossing of an image.
 

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:47.920
Of course with this prophecy
the poem will come to an end,

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.719
and the poem comes to an end
with Dante,

00:58:50.719 --> 00:58:53.219
who goes--and I will talk about
this image again--

00:58:53.219 --> 00:58:56.780
who has to be ritually immersed.
 

00:58:56.780 --> 00:58:59.949
He will be immersed into two
rivers.

00:58:59.949 --> 00:59:04.304
The river Lethe,
the river of forgetfulness and

00:59:04.304 --> 00:59:08.659
the river Eunoe,
the river of good memories.

00:59:08.659 --> 00:59:13.800
It's a ritual--this is toward
the end of Canto XXXIII--

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:16.440
that reminds you of the ritual
actions at the beginning of

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.155
Canto I,
where Dante washes his face and

00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:24.146
has to gird his loins with--
you remember with the reed that

00:59:24.146 --> 00:59:28.960
was growing spontaneously on the
shore of the sea.

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.014
What Dante goes on saying is
the two rivers,

00:59:33.014 --> 00:59:37.161
Lethe and Eunoe,
derive--flow out of the same

00:59:37.161 --> 00:59:38.199
source.
 

00:59:38.199 --> 00:59:41.597
And then he says,
like two lazy friends,

00:59:41.597 --> 00:59:46.391
friends who are fond of each
other, they go on departing

00:59:46.391 --> 00:59:47.349
lazily.
 

00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:48.809
That's the image that he uses.
 

00:59:48.809 --> 00:59:53.099
What is interesting is that
he's thinking of memory and

00:59:53.099 --> 00:59:56.280
forgetfulness,
the Lethe and Eunoe,

00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.208
as entailing each other,
so that there's no erasure

01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:02.650
which is not at the same time a
memory,

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:06.179
that each contains the other
and Dante will go--

01:00:06.179 --> 01:00:09.079
has a lot to say about
forgetful memory,

01:00:09.079 --> 01:00:12.829
especially in the way the poem
will be written.

01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:17.809
Finally, with a line,
the whole poem ends with--

01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:23.760
the whole of Purgatorio
ends with a line that obviously

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:28.250
reminds you of the very end
Inferno,

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:29.875
"From the most holy
waters,"

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:32.579
this is Canto XXXIII,
"I came forth again

01:00:32.579 --> 01:00:34.659
remade,
even as new plants,"

01:00:34.659 --> 01:00:38.050
the very language of the
beginning of Purgatorio,

01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:43.126
"renewed with new leaves,
pure and ready to mount to the

01:00:43.126 --> 01:00:44.389
stars."
 

01:00:44.389 --> 01:00:50.545
Dante once again now is at the
top of Purgatory and he will fly

01:00:50.545 --> 01:00:52.693
next,
like lightening,

01:00:52.693 --> 01:00:57.688
onto the Moon and we shall see
him in this kind of planetary

01:00:57.688 --> 01:01:01.978
epic,
cosmological epic that we'll

01:01:01.978 --> 01:01:04.500
start on next time.
 

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:12.438
Now I'm sure you have questions
and we are doing okay with

01:01:12.438 --> 01:01:16.059
timing, so please shoot.
 

01:01:30.639 --> 01:01:33.789
Yes.
 

01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:37.989
Student:  You mentioned
a transition from the ethical in

01:01:37.989 --> 01:01:41.239
Purgatory to the aesthetic in
Paradise.

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:51.659
Could you just expand
&gt;?

01:01:51.659 --> 01:01:57.699
Prof: Very good question.
 

01:01:57.699 --> 01:02:02.952
The question is--that I spoke
about in Canto XXX of

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:08.181
Purgatorio,
I spoke about the transition,

01:02:08.181 --> 01:02:13.603
formal transition from the
structure of the epic with

01:02:13.603 --> 01:02:16.826
Virgil,
the poet of the epic,

01:02:16.826 --> 01:02:20.355
and then moving onto--
in effect I spoke of the

01:02:20.355 --> 01:02:24.429
autobiographical,
first of all where Beatrice

01:02:24.429 --> 01:02:27.599
refers to--
calls Dante by name.

01:02:27.599 --> 01:02:31.079
So it's his story,
Dante, don't cry because Virgil

01:02:31.079 --> 01:02:33.684
has disappeared,
I'm going to give you a chance

01:02:33.684 --> 01:02:36.280
to cry for other reasons and
then goes on into a confession,

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.969
which is an Augustinian poem.
 

01:02:37.969 --> 01:02:39.963
But also it's true,
I mentioned there is a

01:02:39.963 --> 01:02:43.507
transition to--
I mean, I did say that in

01:02:43.507 --> 01:02:49.159
Paradise is the world of
aesthetics where the ethical

01:02:49.159 --> 01:02:54.050
ordering is liquidated in a
certain sense.

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:57.505
So the question is,
how does this respond to the

01:02:57.505 --> 01:02:59.268
whole arc of the poem?
 

01:02:59.268 --> 01:03:02.846
What kind of--what am I really
saying about the whole

01:03:02.846 --> 01:03:06.766
experience of the poem to make
the aesthetic essential for

01:03:06.766 --> 01:03:09.380
knowledge, if that's the
argument?

01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.349
That is true.
 

01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:13.576
I really welcome this question
because that's the way I'm

01:03:13.576 --> 01:03:15.938
reading poetry,
as if poetry were a way of

01:03:15.938 --> 01:03:16.630
knowing.
 

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:21.152
I keep saying this,
that it's really a way of

01:03:21.152 --> 01:03:27.213
knowing from that point of view,
a philosophical kind of poetry,

01:03:27.213 --> 01:03:31.186
realizing and keeping in mind
that there are always

01:03:31.186 --> 01:03:35.237
distinctions and ongoing
quarrels between poetry and

01:03:35.237 --> 01:03:36.510
philosophy.
 

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:41.050
Paradiso is--like any
true ethics,

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:43.530
this is a general
pronouncement,

01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:47.119
Dante doesn't make it,
but it's a kind of premise to

01:03:47.119 --> 01:03:48.599
what I'll be saying later.
 

01:03:48.599 --> 01:03:52.563
Any true ethics can only be
successful in the measure in

01:03:52.563 --> 01:03:54.510
which it stops operating.
 

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:58.655
That's when the ethics is
really--you can say that it has

01:03:58.655 --> 01:04:00.579
done its job as it were.
 

01:04:00.579 --> 01:04:05.858
So we enter a world where now
is the world of Paradise

01:04:05.858 --> 01:04:09.730
and Dante goes on representing
this world.

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:11.949
He'll never forget the earth.
 

01:04:11.949 --> 01:04:15.378
I have to qualify that,
even in Paradise,

01:04:15.378 --> 01:04:17.860
he's going to look at the
earth.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:23.291
He celebrates the greatest
aspects of human life:

01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:28.608
work, love, things that
join--joy--the community

01:04:28.608 --> 01:04:30.079
together.
 

01:04:30.079 --> 01:04:33.063
He will see also the
distortions that are going

01:04:33.063 --> 01:04:37.083
on--where they are the--in the
Empire, in the political life or

01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:39.030
in the life of the Church.
 

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:41.987
Every time that there is a
retrospective look,

01:04:41.987 --> 01:04:45.010
there is a kind of dismay that
he will feel.

01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:48.217
So there is all of that,
but the emphasis is on the

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:51.170
world of Paradise:
it's about dance,

01:04:51.170 --> 01:04:55.217
it's about songs,
it's about love,

01:04:55.217 --> 01:04:59.880
it's about stars wooing each
other,

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:03.869
it's about spectacular mise en
scène,

01:05:03.869 --> 01:05:08.170
the pyrotechnics of--it's about
different forms of light.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.130
What is this about?
 

01:05:09.130 --> 01:05:12.139
Exactly what I call the
aesthetic experience;

01:05:12.139 --> 01:05:15.880
these are all poetic artistic
experiences.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.824
The first thing we are to keep
in mind is Dante really thinks

01:05:20.824 --> 01:05:25.688
of a theology that is really
like poetry: a theology that is

01:05:25.688 --> 01:05:29.853
like poetry,
in the sense that both are part

01:05:29.853 --> 01:05:31.927
of--
or if you wish an even--won't

01:05:31.927 --> 01:05:33.219
even call it theology.
 

01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:35.130
Let me call it--finish that
sentence--

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:38.914
theology which is like poetry
in the sense that it's a playful

01:05:38.914 --> 01:05:42.898
theology,
a way of understanding that the

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:48.960
essence of God now can be seen
in his comical figuration.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:53.434
A God who is the artist,
a God who thinks that this the

01:05:53.434 --> 01:05:57.000
way in which human beings were
supposed--

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.300
were first created in the
Garden of Eden,

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:02.829
where we are really in a
garden, meant to play,

01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:04.989
and that's where we are going
back too.

01:06:04.989 --> 01:06:10.257
It's a way of casting the
divinity in the most--as beauty,

01:06:10.257 --> 01:06:14.139
a beauty that also encompasses
the good.

01:06:14.139 --> 01:06:17.862
Beyond that,
beyond this playful or ludic

01:06:17.862 --> 01:06:20.416
theology,
this idea of an aesthetic

01:06:20.416 --> 01:06:22.646
theology,
there is something else that

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:25.900
Dante is saying about the
proximity between the poetic and

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:26.869
the religious.
 

01:06:26.869 --> 01:06:30.791
It's not a connection that is
usually made because we tend to

01:06:30.791 --> 01:06:34.387
believe that the poetic is just
the world of deceptions,

01:06:34.387 --> 01:06:35.500
make believe.
 

01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:38.699
In fact, it's both,
the poetic and the religious,

01:06:38.699 --> 01:06:41.280
and we can say that even about
the philosophical if you wish,

01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:45.170
they respond to profound
impulses within us.

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:46.659
They are emotions that we have.
 

01:06:46.659 --> 01:06:50.045
You see beauty and you tremble
in the presence of beauty,

01:06:50.045 --> 01:06:52.949
whether it's a human beauty,
it's natural beauty,

01:06:52.949 --> 01:06:54.340
or artistic beauty.
 

01:06:54.340 --> 01:06:57.751
Whatever it is that we're
encountering there is something

01:06:57.751 --> 01:07:01.650
that responds in us and the same
thing about the idea of awe,

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:05.440
and the idea of discovery of
sense of the sublime,

01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:08.500
whenever you have what we call
a religious experience.

01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.800
The two are not neatly
separated;

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.469
this is what drives the poet in
the journey of Paradise.

01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:20.500
This is where the actual source
of his inspiration,

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.722
that's the novelty that Dante
represents and which probably

01:07:24.722 --> 01:07:28.762
some Romantic poets much later--
I'm talking about the

01:07:28.762 --> 01:07:32.855
nineteenth century have been
trying to restore or grasp,

01:07:32.855 --> 01:07:34.119
or understand.
 

01:07:34.119 --> 01:07:37.840
You do have that in Dante.
 

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:41.280
Do you have it for instance in
the Bible?

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:43.362
I dare say you do,
because whenever we think

01:07:43.362 --> 01:07:46.382
about--
there are so many courses at

01:07:46.382 --> 01:07:50.893
Yale that used to be taught,
I don't look at the offerings

01:07:50.893 --> 01:07:53.719
anymore because I think I know
them by heart,

01:07:53.719 --> 01:07:55.791
not for any other reason--but
"the Bible as

01:07:55.791 --> 01:07:56.630
literature."
 

01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:58.400
It is great,
but the idea,

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:02.579
the underlying idea is always
that the Bible can only has to

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:05.869
be read--
novels--that's all right,

01:08:05.869 --> 01:08:09.380
that's very good but that's not
all.

01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:11.568
To say that,
as I did, that the Song of

01:08:11.568 --> 01:08:14.275
Songs is a fantastic--I said it
ten minutes ago,

01:08:14.275 --> 01:08:17.270
that the Song of Songs is a
fantastic love poem.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:22.088
What I'm really saying is that
the poetic is already in itself

01:08:22.088 --> 01:08:26.353
proximate to the religious,
so that when we think about the

01:08:26.353 --> 01:08:29.591
Bible and literature we are
already rephrasing another

01:08:29.591 --> 01:08:32.340
version of this problem which is
that of--

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.684
that Dante presents as the
religious and the poetic in

01:08:35.684 --> 01:08:36.819
Paradise.
 

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:38.409
I hope I've answered your
question.

01:08:38.409 --> 01:08:40.390
Thank you.

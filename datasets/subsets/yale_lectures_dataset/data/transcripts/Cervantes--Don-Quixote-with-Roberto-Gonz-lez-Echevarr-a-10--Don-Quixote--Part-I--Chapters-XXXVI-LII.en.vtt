00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.160
Prof: We are moving
towards the end of Part I,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.304
that is, the 1605
Quixote,

00:00:09.304 --> 00:00:18.061
and as we move towards the end,
I'm sure you will have noticed

00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:24.096
that there are a number of
returns and repetitions which

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:30.460
give density to the fiction by
being cross-referenced,

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.273
as it were, within itself,
meaning that there are

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:42.330
characters who reappear and
incidents that are,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.342
if not repeated exactly as
before, recall previous

00:00:47.342 --> 00:00:48.570
incidents.
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.750
There are three such character
and/or incidents,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.380
one of which I will discuss in
detail,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.210
and two others that I will just
mention briefly here at the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.260
beginning of today's lecture.
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.019
These are the galley slaves,
one;

00:01:07.019 --> 00:01:14.835
two, is Andrés;
and three, is the postprandial

00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:15.870
speech.
 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:22.555
Now, the galley slaves are
mentioned again when the priest

00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:28.656
and the barber bring up the
incident to explain their

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:34.896
presence at the inn,
or the presence in their

00:01:34.896 --> 00:01:40.001
meeting Don Quixote;
they say that they were

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:45.384
supposed to be assaulted by
these freed prisoners as they

00:01:45.384 --> 00:01:49.268
were on their way--
not the prisoners,

00:01:49.268 --> 00:01:54.183
but the barber and priest--
as they were on their way to

00:01:54.183 --> 00:01:57.120
collect some money sent from
America.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.668
They do this to embarrass the
knight and to persuade him that

00:02:02.668 --> 00:02:06.644
what he has done is not right,
that in fact,

00:02:06.644 --> 00:02:08.310
it is a crime.
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.441
The priest gives a proper legal
interpretation to Don Quixote's

00:02:14.441 --> 00:02:15.430
actions.
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:22.490
He has committed a crime
against the Crown,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:28.188
because the galley slaves were
under its jurisdiction,

00:02:28.188 --> 00:02:30.870
being that they were being sent
to the galleys,

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.092
that they were on the road,
and that they were being

00:02:34.092 --> 00:02:39.724
guarded by agents of the Crown,
as opposed to other branches of

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:44.788
justice,
and remember that because of

00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:52.949
the regional independence in
Spain there were various kinds

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:57.697
of police,
but these galley slaves were

00:02:57.697 --> 00:03:05.173
under the purview of the Crown,
which makes Don Quixote's crime

00:03:05.173 --> 00:03:06.800
much worse.
 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.998
This prepares the second
mention of the incident of the

00:03:11.998 --> 00:03:17.645
freeing of the galley slaves,
which is when Don Quixote is,

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:20.961
in fact,
nabbed by the Holy Brotherhood,

00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:23.000
precisely for that crime.
 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.530
I will speak about this later,
but notice that the characters,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.947
who are presumably out to bring
Don Quixote to reason and to

00:03:35.947 --> 00:03:41.960
bring him home,
go in and out of his madness

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:51.150
participating and expanding with
their lies his delusions;

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.544
notice that there is an
elaborate lie here that the

00:03:54.544 --> 00:03:56.310
priest has come up with.
 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.318
This is one of larger themes of
the Quixote,

00:04:03.318 --> 00:04:09.919
that, although society cannot
cope with his madness because it

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:15.979
shows the arbitrariness of laws
from outside of them,

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:19.937
members of society are
themselves toeing a very thin

00:04:19.937 --> 00:04:24.750
line between their compliance
with societal laws and norms,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:31.290
and acting insane themselves.
 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.064
Ultimately, and this may very
well be beyond anything that

00:04:36.064 --> 00:04:41.271
Cervantes intended to do,
the figure of Don Quixote being

00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:46.440
a mad individual questions the
very core of the rules and

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.040
regulations that sustain daily
life.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.831
Don Quixote's most original
feature as a character of

00:04:56.831 --> 00:05:00.750
fiction is his being insane.
 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.490
It gives him a transcendence,
a certain kind of

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.139
transcendence.
 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.069
He is truly the first insane
protagonist in western

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:14.466
literature,
and there have been others

00:05:14.466 --> 00:05:19.327
since, but none with this kind
of transcendental form of

00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:20.300
madness.
 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.540
So that's the first of the
returns.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.319
Two, Andrés.
 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:32.091
Andrés
returns--remember,

00:05:32.091 --> 00:05:35.579
that Andrés was a young
man that was young man that was

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:39.120
being flogged by Juan Haldudo,
and Don Quixote intervenes,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.636
and so forth;
I'm sure you remember this

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:45.529
episode which took place during
Don Quixote's first sally.

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.430
Andrés returns and
reveals that what Don Quixote

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.250
did for him made his situation
worse.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.589
This is parallel to the mention
of the galley slaves,

00:05:56.589 --> 00:06:00.360
because it brings up that Don
Quixote's actions have had the

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.790
opposite effect of what he
intended.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.067
In both cases,
he defends himself by saying

00:06:06.067 --> 00:06:09.660
that he was upholding the laws
of chivalry,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:16.504
which are superior to the laws
and customs of the time in which

00:06:16.504 --> 00:06:17.720
he lives.
 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.980
But the interesting detail
here, the significant detail

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.298
here,
is that Andrés is on his

00:06:27.298 --> 00:06:32.586
way to Seville,
which, as we now know,

00:06:32.586 --> 00:06:37.759
is the center of picaresque
life.

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.990
Seville is the center of
picaresque life,

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:46.168
and you will have this
reinforced when you read by the

00:06:46.168 --> 00:06:50.021
next class,
I hope, the exemplary story

00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:55.696
Rinconete and Cortadillo,
which takes place precisely in

00:06:55.696 --> 00:06:56.560
Seville.
 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:04.774
So the fact is that his return
shows or suggests

00:07:04.774 --> 00:07:15.959
retrospectively that he was a
pícaro all along,

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:23.899
that he was probably guilty
when Haldudo flogged him,

00:07:23.899 --> 00:07:30.560
so these returns cast light
retrospectively on the previous

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.245
episodes--
As I said, they established

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:39.029
these kind of inner world of
references in the fiction.

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:41.595
Sancho has to give
Andrés something to get

00:07:41.595 --> 00:07:42.290
rid of him.
 

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:48.906
The reappearance of characters
is a narrative device that

00:07:48.906 --> 00:07:54.223
Cervantes will use more
frequently in Part II,

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:59.540
which is a more tightly
structured novel.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:03.463
And the return of characters is
something that some of

00:08:03.463 --> 00:08:07.240
Cervantes's followers in the
eighteenth century,

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.970
like Henry Fielding will use,
if you have read,

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.680
if you remember,
your Tom Jones,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.180
for instance.
 

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.709
The third repetition is the
postprandial speech.

00:08:19.709 --> 00:08:21.014
This is a word,
that I'm sure,

00:08:21.014 --> 00:08:22.860
you will never forget after
this class.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.399
It is in Webster's dictionary,
so not it's as recherché

00:08:27.399 --> 00:08:29.259
as it may sound to you.
 

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:34.298
It's an after dinner speech.
 

00:08:34.298 --> 00:08:37.230
Now, this is the speech about
arms and letters.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.005
The speech about arms and
letters is the repetition of the

00:08:41.005 --> 00:08:44.053
near repetition of a similar
previous incident,

00:08:44.053 --> 00:08:46.240
as I'm sure you have noticed.
 

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.822
The speech of the Golden Age
that Don Quixote delivered to

00:08:50.822 --> 00:08:55.565
the goatherds right before the
Marcela and Grisóstomo

00:08:55.565 --> 00:08:56.529
episode.
 

00:08:56.529 --> 00:09:01.224
The speech on arms and letters
harkens back to medieval

00:09:01.224 --> 00:09:06.701
debates, like those wine against
water, clerics against knights,

00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:08.178
and so forth.
 

00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:13.116
These were topics for
rhetorical exercises,

00:09:13.116 --> 00:09:20.759
like those topics for a debate
between debating teams nowadays.

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:24.759
It was a set topic,
arms against letters.

00:09:24.759 --> 00:09:30.210
This is the reason why Don
Quixote delivers the speech,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.923
one of the reasons why he
delivers the speech is part of

00:09:32.923 --> 00:09:35.490
his storehouse of topics that he
has in his mind,

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.533
but it's also true that
Cervantes did practice both arms

00:09:40.533 --> 00:09:44.850
and letters,
and that he valued both,

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:48.279
as did Don Quixote himself.
 

00:09:48.279 --> 00:09:55.224
The topic in the speech also
refers to utopian models of

00:09:55.224 --> 00:09:59.851
behavior,
roles codified by the

00:09:59.851 --> 00:10:05.889
Renaissance: the courtier,
the knight, the poet or man of

00:10:05.889 --> 00:10:07.700
letters,
and in Spain,

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.058
the saint were models of
deportment.

00:10:11.058 --> 00:10:16.629
Baltasar, I have left an 's'
out of his name,

00:10:16.629 --> 00:10:26.759
Baltasare Castiglione,
who wrote a book--

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:32.083
you are getting progressively a
list of important Renaissance

00:10:32.083 --> 00:10:37.320
books that you must keep in mind
when reading Cervantes--

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:45.022
Castiglione is 1478-1529;
he published The Book of the

00:10:45.022 --> 00:10:47.750
Courtier in 1528.
 

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:53.408
It is a book in which these
modes of behavior are codified,

00:10:53.408 --> 00:10:56.529
these ideal modes of behavior.
 

00:10:56.529 --> 00:11:01.644
The answer to the debate,
I mean the result of the

00:11:01.644 --> 00:11:05.398
debate,
is that the ideal is Don

00:11:05.398 --> 00:11:11.490
Quixote's own ideal of a
reflective man of action which

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:16.011
will then following,
will be personified in the

00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:20.258
captain,
who becomes the captive in the

00:11:20.258 --> 00:11:21.558
next tale.
 

00:11:21.558 --> 00:11:25.514
This is the current debate
between the politically

00:11:25.514 --> 00:11:30.278
committed individual and the
intellectual in the ivory tower

00:11:30.278 --> 00:11:34.879
to establish a clear cut
distinctionâ€“You know,

00:11:34.879 --> 00:11:38.543
there are these debates about
whether you want to be a Che

00:11:38.543 --> 00:11:41.048
Guevara,
or you want to be a great

00:11:41.048 --> 00:11:48.833
intellectual,
o it has sort of a contemporary

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:54.923
relevancy,
but it is essentially a topic

00:11:54.923 --> 00:11:56.610
of the times.
 

00:11:56.610 --> 00:12:02.227
Now, again, the focus is on the
intersection between literature

00:12:02.227 --> 00:12:06.850
and current history,
between fiction and reality.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.649
Américo Castro,
whose name--

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:12.735
I am going to mention several
critics and I have put their

00:12:12.735 --> 00:12:15.278
names here so that you know how
to write it--

00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:22.532
Américo Castro wrote in
a book called El pensamiento

00:12:22.532 --> 00:12:26.971
de Cervantes,
Cervantes' Thoughts,

00:12:26.971 --> 00:12:30.941
or Cervantes' Way of
Thinking or Cervantes'

00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:33.503
Ideas,
published in 1925,

00:12:33.503 --> 00:12:37.899
it's a book that I believe that
I mentioned before,

00:12:37.899 --> 00:12:42.058
but if I didn't it is one of
the best books,

00:12:42.058 --> 00:12:46.418
the most important books about
Cervantes ever written,

00:12:46.418 --> 00:12:50.008
because in that book
Américo Castro dispelled

00:12:50.008 --> 00:12:54.287
the notion that Cervantes was,
as the phrase went,

00:12:54.287 --> 00:12:56.759
an ingenio lego.
 

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:03.221
You remember the word
ingenio from one of the

00:13:03.221 --> 00:13:07.702
earlier classes,
'wit'--Examen de ingenios

00:13:07.702 --> 00:13:11.110
remember the book by Huarte
de San Juan,

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.134
the doctor, and remember,
'ingenio' is in the

00:13:14.134 --> 00:13:16.144
title,
El ingenioso hidalgo Don

00:13:16.144 --> 00:13:20.385
Quixote--
Ingenio lego meant that

00:13:20.385 --> 00:13:25.370
Cervantes was an unlearned wit,
a natural.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:29.360
That is, that Cervantes had
innate ability as a great

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:32.967
narrator and so forth,
but that he really lacked

00:13:32.967 --> 00:13:33.889
culture.
 

00:13:33.889 --> 00:13:38.650
This was a romantic idea,
the idea of the creator who

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:44.418
invents out of nothing his books
and stories and all of that.

00:13:44.418 --> 00:13:47.221
It was also a very
nationalistic reading of

00:13:47.221 --> 00:13:51.490
Cervantes, because those critics
say, this is the spirit of Spain

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:54.158
expressing itself through
Cervantes.

00:13:54.158 --> 00:13:58.650
Américo Castro
demonstrated that this was all

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.966
hogwash,
that Cervantes was steeped in

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:05.610
Italian Renaissance literature
and thought,

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:10.470
and that therefore he was no
ingenio lego at all.

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:15.538
Well, in that book
Américo Castro writes,

00:14:15.538 --> 00:14:19.726
I quote: "The debate
between arms and letters is a

00:14:19.726 --> 00:14:24.691
harbinger of the importance that
learning and reason acquire over

00:14:24.691 --> 00:14:26.320
traditional life.
 

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.692
The intellectual arm with
theoretical reason is getting

00:14:30.692 --> 00:14:34.337
ready to intervene in the fate
of Europe"

00:14:34.337 --> 00:14:35.308
Unquote.
 

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:38.514
Absorb that,
the intellectual arm with

00:14:38.514 --> 00:14:43.626
theoretical reason is getting
ready to intervene in the fate

00:14:43.626 --> 00:14:44.840
of Europe.
 

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.974
In other words,
government will not be just

00:14:47.974 --> 00:14:52.451
left in the hands of kings and
aristocrats whose expertise in

00:14:52.451 --> 00:14:56.480
ruling countries was based on
traditional knowledge and

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.538
practice passed down by
tradition,

00:14:59.538 --> 00:15:03.129
but that the practice of
government is becoming the

00:15:03.129 --> 00:15:06.360
object of serious and sustained
reflection.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.298
It is the birth of political
science as a discipline that we

00:15:11.298 --> 00:15:14.899
are witnessing in the sixteenth
century,

00:15:14.899 --> 00:15:18.139
and that it is reflected in Don
Quixote's speech.

00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:23.758
In this regard,
the figure to keep in mind is

00:15:23.758 --> 00:15:27.590
Niccolò
Machiavelli,

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:34.826
1469-1527 and his famous
treaties called Il

00:15:34.826 --> 00:15:38.697
principe,
The Prince,

00:15:38.697 --> 00:15:42.298
which was written in 1513 and
published in 1532,

00:15:42.298 --> 00:15:46.570
which is really the founding
work of political science.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.730
I know that you may have a
vague idea of Machiavelli,

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.048
mostly centered on the
cliché

00:15:53.048 --> 00:15:56.230
that the ends justify the means
and so forth--

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.556
I'm sure you've heard that and
attributed that as a

00:15:58.556 --> 00:16:03.196
Machiavellian idea--
but his book is much more than

00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:05.282
that,
it's very complicated and

00:16:05.282 --> 00:16:07.220
complex and influential and
important.

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:11.179
One of Machiavelli's models,
by the way,

00:16:11.179 --> 00:16:17.378
was Ferdinand of Aragón,
whom you have met extensively

00:16:17.378 --> 00:16:23.288
while reading your Elliott for a
cunning ruler,

00:16:23.288 --> 00:16:28.000
who knew how to apply the rules
of government.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.307
Castro adds with regards to Don
Quixote's speech--by the way,

00:16:32.307 --> 00:16:36.543
Castro is a very common last
name, it has nothing to do with

00:16:36.543 --> 00:16:41.000
the Castro;
'castrum' in Latin meant

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.934
a military encampment,
so therefore it was very easy

00:16:45.934 --> 00:16:49.210
for them to be many Castros in
Spanish,

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:51.129
so that's why there are so many
of them--

00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:56.038
Castro adds with regards to Don
Quixote's speech,

00:16:56.038 --> 00:16:57.775
he says the following,
and I'm going to quote

00:16:57.775 --> 00:16:59.000
Américo Castro,
again.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.419
He says: "We are,
again, faced with the

00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:04.628
essentially Cervantean dualism,
epic heroic fantasy versus

00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:06.598
reason and reflexive criticism.
 

00:17:06.598 --> 00:17:09.487
At a point in his speech,
Don Quixote exclaims,

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:13.190
'But let us leave this aside,
because it is a labyrinth with

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.318
no easy exit.'
 

00:17:14.318 --> 00:17:19.983
The fulcrum of Cervantes' soul
where both planes intersect each

00:17:19.983 --> 00:17:23.912
other [heroic fantasy and
reasonable effort]

00:17:23.912 --> 00:17:27.612
belongs to both;
thus this theme dwells within

00:17:27.612 --> 00:17:30.452
him [I'm still quoting
Américo Castro]

00:17:30.452 --> 00:17:33.650
dwells within Cervantes,
being of a primarily

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:37.855
formalistic nature,
but it is also the mold for the

00:17:37.855 --> 00:17:42.640
sociological preoccupations of
the Renaissance."

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.308
Unquote.
 

00:17:44.308 --> 00:17:47.558
However, Don Quixote does favor
arms over letters,

00:17:47.558 --> 00:17:53.336
as he says, and the fact is
that he has just won the battle

00:17:53.336 --> 00:17:57.310
with the giant,
of which the speech is a kind

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:02.799
of celebration,
so he opts for arms over

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:10.170
letters, perhaps with Cervantes
himself,

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:15.828
who always had a fondness for
his life as a soldier,

00:18:15.828 --> 00:18:18.964
as you, no doubt,
noticed in reading the tale of

00:18:18.964 --> 00:18:19.900
the captive.
 

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:27.400
So we get back to our speech
and dinner's topic.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.431
This is the second,
again, I said postprandial

00:18:30.431 --> 00:18:33.798
speech by Don Quixote,
the first was concerned with

00:18:33.798 --> 00:18:35.078
the Golden Age.
 

00:18:35.078 --> 00:18:38.122
The Russian critic and
theoretician Mijaíl

00:18:38.122 --> 00:18:40.669
Bajtín,
whom I have mentioned before,

00:18:40.669 --> 00:18:45.640
and I forgot to put his name,
but I'll put it again.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.752
This is all,
of course, an approximation,

00:18:48.752 --> 00:18:51.009
this name from the Russian.
 

00:18:51.009 --> 00:19:00.000
Don't confuse him with these
guys.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:06.693
Mijaíl Bajtín,
in his book Rabelais

00:19:06.693 --> 00:19:10.976
gives a great deal of importance
to dinners because his metaphor

00:19:10.976 --> 00:19:15.278
for the novel,
what the novel is like is the

00:19:15.278 --> 00:19:20.269
dialogue and dinners are
essentially dialogic.

00:19:20.269 --> 00:19:25.548
There is a book on
Bajtín called Bajtin's

00:19:25.548 --> 00:19:28.400
Dialogic Imagination.
 

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:34.980
Now, François Rabelais
is yet another Renaissance

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.690
figure you must keep in mind.
 

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:43.000
He was French for a change,
not Italian,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.759
and lived between 1492 and
1553.

00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:50.108
He wrote these outrageous
stories about Gargantua and

00:19:50.108 --> 00:19:52.848
Pantagruel as you may have
heard about.

00:19:52.848 --> 00:19:57.420
Bajtín writes the
following,

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:02.098
that I cannot resist
quoting--Bajtín wrote

00:20:02.098 --> 00:20:08.337
with a great deal of verve about
elements of popular culture that

00:20:08.337 --> 00:20:12.140
were incorporated into
literature--

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:17.858
He says--I think he learned a
lot from Cervantes,

00:20:17.858 --> 00:20:20.623
so much so that he doesn't
write about Cervantes because it

00:20:20.623 --> 00:20:23.758
may have been redundant:
"Eating and drinking are

00:20:23.758 --> 00:20:27.454
one of the most significant
manifestations of the grotesque

00:20:27.454 --> 00:20:30.834
body [he's talking about the
grotesque bodies of these

00:20:30.834 --> 00:20:33.318
characters in
Rabelais].

00:20:33.318 --> 00:20:38.828
The distinctive character
of this body is its open,

00:20:38.828 --> 00:20:42.950
unfinished nature,
its interaction with the world

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:48.221
[you can think of Sancho here],
these traits are most fully and

00:20:48.221 --> 00:20:51.410
concretely revealed in the act
of eating.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:54.930
The body transgresses here its
own limits;

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.795
it swallows,
devours, rends the world apart,

00:20:58.795 --> 00:21:03.019
is enriched and grows at the
world's expense.

00:21:03.019 --> 00:21:06.750
The encounter of man with the
world,

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:17.558
which takes place inside the
open biting,

00:21:17.558 --> 00:21:21.000
rending, chewing mouth--[I'm
gonna read that sentence again,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.359
because my mouth got a
little]--the encounter of man

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:28.566
with the world,
which takes place inside the

00:21:28.566 --> 00:21:31.538
open biting,
rending, chewing mouth is one

00:21:31.538 --> 00:21:35.522
of the most ancient and most
important objects of human

00:21:35.522 --> 00:21:37.220
thought and imagery.
 

00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:41.692
Here man tastes the world,
introduces it into his body,

00:21:41.692 --> 00:21:43.930
makes it part of himself.
 

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:48.298
Man's awakening consciousness
could not but concentrate on

00:21:48.298 --> 00:21:51.352
this moment,
could not help borrowing from

00:21:51.352 --> 00:21:54.500
it a number of substantial
images determining its

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:56.598
interrelation with the world.
 

00:21:56.598 --> 00:22:01.076
Man's encounter with the world
in the act of eating is joyful,

00:22:01.076 --> 00:22:05.258
triumphant, he triumphs over
the world, devours it without

00:22:05.258 --> 00:22:07.240
being devoured himself.
 

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:12.484
The limits between man and the
world are erased to man's

00:22:12.484 --> 00:22:14.009
advantage."
 

00:22:14.009 --> 00:22:15.058
Unquote.
 

00:22:15.058 --> 00:22:17.770
As you can see,
in all of these scenes of

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.160
eating,
of which there will be many

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.380
more in Part II,
in which particularly Sancho is

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:31.027
involved in this joyful way,
the barrier between me and

00:22:31.027 --> 00:22:34.880
reality is broken when I
incorporate reality into myself,

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.548
make it part of myself by
eating it,

00:22:36.548 --> 00:22:44.578
and this is what is celebrated
in these postprandial speeches.

00:22:44.578 --> 00:22:47.348
For Bajtín,
dinners are the privileged

00:22:47.348 --> 00:22:50.575
occasion for dialogue;
dinners celebrate the end of

00:22:50.575 --> 00:22:52.720
work and the defeat of the
world,

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.940
which is, in fact,
consumed, animals,

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.460
vegetables, wine,
which is like the blood of the

00:22:58.460 --> 00:22:58.890
earth.
 

00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:02.051
Wine loosens the tongue and the
truth comes out

00:23:02.051 --> 00:23:06.244
unguarded--remember the Latin
phrase that I taught you before,

00:23:06.244 --> 00:23:08.170
in vino, veritas.
 

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:14.000
Plato's Symposium,
whom I'm sure you have read,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.750
and it's called really,
the Banquet,

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:22.113
'the last supper,' all mark
ritual occasions where the truth

00:23:22.113 --> 00:23:25.220
is to be spoken over food or
after food.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.202
There are, of course,
two other functions of the

00:23:30.202 --> 00:23:36.354
mouth that are not mentioned
here, but that do occasionally

00:23:36.354 --> 00:23:41.019
come into the erotic and the
aggressive.

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:43.970
The erotic I don't have to and
I won't go into here,

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:45.068
it's too obvious.
 

00:23:45.068 --> 00:23:49.220
The aggressive,
of course, is to bite,

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.825
to spit, and,
as we have seen in an earlier

00:23:52.825 --> 00:23:55.874
episode,
to vomit on somebody else,

00:23:55.874 --> 00:24:00.730
as we saw in that dialogue of
vomits after the episode of the

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:01.460
sheep.
 

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:08.872
So I am assuming a bajtinean
sort of a persona as I make

00:24:08.872 --> 00:24:15.070
these comments,
because he was so interested in

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:18.710
these bodily functions.
 

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:24.255
So the truth has prevailed in
the resolution of all of the

00:24:24.255 --> 00:24:28.577
conflicts,
and Don Quixote celebrates with

00:24:28.577 --> 00:24:31.272
his speech,
and he, the mad man,

00:24:31.272 --> 00:24:34.170
has been the vehicle of that
resolution.

00:24:34.170 --> 00:24:40.771
The speech also serves as a
transition to the captive's

00:24:40.771 --> 00:24:47.984
tale, which will be narrating
episodes of war to corroborate

00:24:47.984 --> 00:24:50.920
Don Quixote's ideas.
 

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:56.923
In fact, the captive's tale
will narrate that battle,

00:24:56.923 --> 00:25:03.042
called the Battle of Lepanto,
whose anniversary we are

00:25:03.042 --> 00:25:05.930
celebrating tomorrow.
 

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:11.338
The Battle of Lepanto occurred
on October seventh,

00:25:11.338 --> 00:25:15.917
1571, so this is what I told
you at the end of last lecture

00:25:15.917 --> 00:25:20.576
to ponder and see if you could
come up with what anniversary

00:25:20.576 --> 00:25:24.710
was being celebrated this week;
it is the Battle of Lepanto.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:28.759
The suggestion was that once
the various conflicts were

00:25:28.759 --> 00:25:32.960
resolved Don Quixote celebrated
by his speech on arms and

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.858
letters.
 

00:25:33.858 --> 00:25:37.114
Through Bajtín we
concluded that this was a moment

00:25:37.114 --> 00:25:40.950
of truth ironically represented
through the scene of the dinner.

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:46.038
There seems to be a whole
tendency in the Quixote,

00:25:46.038 --> 00:25:51.061
as we approach the end,
towards the truth that

00:25:51.061 --> 00:25:55.750
culminates in the story of the
captive,

00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:01.493
which is based on Cervantes'
own life and on episodes of

00:26:01.493 --> 00:26:05.727
recent Spanish history,
but more importantly,

00:26:05.727 --> 00:26:08.690
episodes in which Cervantes was
present.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:15.516
Could Cervantes circling back
to himself be a part of this

00:26:15.516 --> 00:26:18.509
move towards the truth?
 

00:26:18.509 --> 00:26:25.787
Is it a shift away from
literary stories to stories

00:26:25.787 --> 00:26:32.920
based on his own life,
and what does that mean?

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.656
As Ciriaco Morón Arroyo
has said--this is the second

00:26:37.656 --> 00:26:40.874
critic I am mentioning;
he's my friend,

00:26:40.874 --> 00:26:44.318
he was my colleague at Cornell
University,

00:26:44.318 --> 00:26:47.779
and of course Morón
doesn't mean 'moron' as it does

00:26:47.779 --> 00:26:51.088
in English,
so it is perfectly okay to have

00:26:51.088 --> 00:26:55.342
such a last name in Spanish,
although for poor Ciriaco,

00:26:55.342 --> 00:26:58.827
whom I love very much,
is in retirement now in Spain,

00:26:58.827 --> 00:27:01.874
it was the bane of his
existence when the students at

00:27:01.874 --> 00:27:05.442
Cornell said,
I'm going to Moron's class,

00:27:05.442 --> 00:27:07.538
but what could he do?
 

00:27:07.538 --> 00:27:12.848
Well, he mostly went then by
Ciriaco M. Arroyo.

00:27:12.848 --> 00:27:15.098
Arroyo means 'brook,' so it's
more--

00:27:15.098 --> 00:27:17.490
In any case,
Ciriaco Morón Arroyo

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:21.288
says that Cervantes has moved to
create art with the truth,

00:27:21.288 --> 00:27:24.269
to create art out of lived
experienced.

00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:28.757
Of course, we might add here
that Cervantes's self as author

00:27:28.757 --> 00:27:31.798
has been presented as a sort of
thin,

00:27:31.798 --> 00:27:36.886
ambiguous and shifting fiction,
and that what stand behind it

00:27:36.886 --> 00:27:40.958
are these snippets of
autobiographical revelation

00:27:40.958 --> 00:27:44.348
underlined by these self
allusions,

00:27:44.348 --> 00:27:47.410
like those to his pastoral
romance La Galatea,

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.348
in the scrutiny of the boos
episode,

00:27:49.348 --> 00:27:53.346
and to Rinconete and
Cortadillo as Don Quixote

00:27:53.346 --> 00:27:55.896
leaves the inn--
This is the story you're

00:27:55.896 --> 00:27:59.669
reading for next Thursday,
everything is made to be

00:27:59.669 --> 00:28:02.480
coordinated in this course.
 

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.767
The story of Rinconete y
Cortadillo, which the

00:28:05.767 --> 00:28:09.000
innkeeper says is among the
papers somebody there left--

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.880
I wonder who that somebody
would be--

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.348
will be included in The
Exemplary Novels,

00:28:14.348 --> 00:28:17.691
the book that you have,
and you will be reading that

00:28:17.691 --> 00:28:23.305
story for next Thursday--
So this is one of those

00:28:23.305 --> 00:28:30.160
snippets, teasing allusions to
himself,

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.750
the real author of the
Quixote.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:36.777
So the captive's tale is the
culmination of the group of

00:28:36.777 --> 00:28:40.583
intertwined stories,
not quite the last one,

00:28:40.583 --> 00:28:44.434
but it is the culmination of
the group of intertwined

00:28:44.434 --> 00:28:45.250
stories.
 

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:51.182
It is one in which religious
conversion intimates a synthesis

00:28:51.182 --> 00:28:56.818
of contraries that surpasses not
just social barriers,

00:28:56.818 --> 00:29:01.073
but even transcends the
neo-platonic convergence typical

00:29:01.073 --> 00:29:07.970
of Renaissance plots--
I will unpack this--In other

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.221
words,
this story entails not just an

00:29:11.221 --> 00:29:16.364
unequal marriage,
that is, social inequality,

00:29:16.364 --> 00:29:21.088
a social clash,
but a marriage that crosses

00:29:21.088 --> 00:29:23.788
racial and religious boundaries.
 

00:29:23.788 --> 00:29:27.902
So the union at the end is not
just a neo-platonic union of

00:29:27.902 --> 00:29:32.877
Renaissance ideas;
there's union through love--I

00:29:32.877 --> 00:29:40.362
mean, Zoraida is a Moor and a
Muslim, and Ruiz Pérez de

00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:45.269
Viedma is a Spaniard and a
Christian.

00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:49.670
Their union is more
transcendental because it

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:54.068
involves the union of these two
religions.

00:29:54.068 --> 00:29:58.486
The tale, I maintain,
could be seen as the

00:29:58.486 --> 00:30:05.380
counterpart of sixteenth century
Spanish mystical poetry in which

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:10.744
courtly love,
about which I've spoken at

00:30:10.744 --> 00:30:15.170
length here,
and Petrarchan conventions are

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:19.298
adapted to express religious
fervor and union,

00:30:19.298 --> 00:30:22.108
not merely with the beloved,
but with God.

00:30:22.108 --> 00:30:25.690
In Spanish mystical poetry the
desire for union is not just

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.467
with the beloved,
it is the desire for a union

00:30:28.467 --> 00:30:29.269
with God.
 

00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:33.910
I'm alluding here mostly to the
poetry of Saint John of the

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:37.313
Cross,
1542-1591, a mystic,

00:30:37.313 --> 00:30:44.960
and one of the greatest poets
of the Golden Age and of any

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.900
age.
 

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:53.170
So, what I'm saying is that
this captive's tale,

00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.746
with this religious fusion is
sort of akin to this mystic

00:30:57.746 --> 00:31:01.670
poetry in the Spain of the
sixteenth century,

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.315
and it is a culmination of all
of these stories because it is

00:31:04.315 --> 00:31:07.349
much more transcendental,
what is going to be overcome is

00:31:07.349 --> 00:31:08.858
much more transcendental.
 

00:31:08.858 --> 00:31:12.630
Now, there is,
as you will see at the end,

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:16.108
a concluding and unfinished
story of one Vicente de la Rosa,

00:31:16.108 --> 00:31:19.380
who's a kind of minor Don Juan
and Leandra,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:25.888
who is a bit of a fool,
and it's unfinished because its

00:31:25.888 --> 00:31:31.294
resolution would--
converges with the end of the

00:31:31.294 --> 00:31:33.560
novel,
and, of course,

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:39.422
the current event cannot have
an end because it is current and

00:31:39.422 --> 00:31:40.480
ongoing.
 

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.990
So that's why that story is
left unfinished,

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.428
but that is one that we will
probably talk about in the next

00:31:46.428 --> 00:31:49.306
class,
because it's really very near

00:31:49.306 --> 00:31:51.640
the very end of the novel.
 

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.880
I'm mentioning it just so as
not to leave any of these

00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.640
stories unmentioned.
 

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.608
Now, the captive's tale follows
a traditional formula.

00:32:02.608 --> 00:32:06.660
It has like a biblical
resonance;

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:10.184
the prodigal son,
the father who sets his son off

00:32:10.184 --> 00:32:10.920
to life.
 

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.071
And remember,
here we encounter that

00:32:15.071 --> 00:32:18.508
"Iglesia,
mar or casa real"

00:32:18.508 --> 00:32:21.858
saying that I mentioned that
the young man should,

00:32:21.858 --> 00:32:25.088
particularly if he's not an
aristocrat,

00:32:25.088 --> 00:32:29.232
he should join the church,
go out to see to seek

00:32:29.232 --> 00:32:33.419
adventure,
or join the retinue of a great

00:32:33.419 --> 00:32:37.509
aristocrat or,
if possible, the king.

00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:43.106
The story illuminates
retrospectively that of Don

00:32:43.106 --> 00:32:46.871
Fernando;
it has provoked controversy

00:32:46.871 --> 00:32:51.558
among critics because of his
religious background.

00:32:51.558 --> 00:32:55.538
Francisco Márquez
Villanueva,

00:32:55.538 --> 00:33:01.141
who was a professor at Harvard
for many years and is retired

00:33:01.141 --> 00:33:04.678
now in Seville,
and was also my friend,

00:33:04.678 --> 00:33:08.970
but he was no friend of Ciriaco
Morón Arroyo--

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:13.558
as you will see,
they debated over this story--

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:19.990
Márquez Villanueva
claims,

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:21.108
for instance,
according to Ciriaco

00:33:21.108 --> 00:33:22.682
Morón Arroyo,
that Zoraida,

00:33:22.682 --> 00:33:24.818
a typically Cervantean
character,

00:33:24.818 --> 00:33:27.883
like Marcela and Dorotea,
exercises her desire for

00:33:27.883 --> 00:33:30.259
freedom within a religious
context,

00:33:30.259 --> 00:33:34.640
but is not motivated by
religion per se.

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:39.710
Religion, i.e.,
becoming a Christian,

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:43.398
merely allows her to be free,
even at the expense of bringing

00:33:43.398 --> 00:33:49.511
grief to her father Agi Morato--
which I noticed that in your

00:33:49.511 --> 00:33:55.259
translation is conflated as
Agimorato,

00:33:55.259 --> 00:34:05.250
but in the Spanish it's Agi
Morato.

00:34:05.250 --> 00:34:07.776
Morón Arroyo claims,
on the contrary,

00:34:07.776 --> 00:34:11.418
that the whole tale takes place
within very precise theological

00:34:11.418 --> 00:34:14.246
guidelines,
which he presents by quoting

00:34:14.246 --> 00:34:16.539
mostly from Saint Thomas
Aquinas.

00:34:16.539 --> 00:34:21.887
His point is that the issue of
baptism is dealt with in a very

00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:24.079
strict theological way.
 

00:34:24.079 --> 00:34:28.329
Zoraida has not been baptized,
as the captive says,

00:34:28.329 --> 00:34:31.010
because she has not been in
mortal danger,

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:34.402
and the baptism of adults in
the Catholic Church should take

00:34:34.402 --> 00:34:37.050
place after their learning about
the faith,

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:40.159
except if faced by a
life-threatening danger.

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:45.202
So Ciriaco observes that this
has been very closely followed

00:34:45.202 --> 00:34:46.400
in the book.
 

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.235
The same is true,
he maintains,

00:34:48.235 --> 00:34:51.969
regarding Zoraida's use of her
father's wealth and her leaving

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:55.686
him behind in grief;
conversion to the Christian

00:34:55.686 --> 00:34:59.179
faith justified doing violence
to nature;

00:34:59.179 --> 00:35:02.121
that is to say,
to relatives I quote Ciriaco

00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:04.791
Morón Arroyo:
"Conversion to

00:35:04.791 --> 00:35:08.690
Christianity justified any break
with natural relations of

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:12.112
kinship if this came into
conflict with the duty to

00:35:12.112 --> 00:35:15.945
convert that anyone who had
learned of Christian doctrine

00:35:15.945 --> 00:35:17.929
had." Unquote.
 

00:35:17.929 --> 00:35:20.994
All of this sounds plausible,
but it is hard to imagine

00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:25.719
Cervantes as a theologian--
I'm going to mediate between

00:35:25.719 --> 00:35:30.375
these two Spaniards--
It is difficult to imagine

00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:34.030
Cervantes as theologian,
and much less as a scholastic

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.619
theologian.
 

00:35:34.619 --> 00:35:38.077
What he is reflecting here,
I think, it just simply the

00:35:38.077 --> 00:35:41.469
morays of the time which were,
of course, Catholic.

00:35:41.469 --> 00:35:48.570
Now, Morón Arroyo is
much more persuasive,

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.461
it seems to me,
when he compares Agi Morato to

00:35:51.461 --> 00:35:54.070
Othello,
after the latter,

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:59.320
first threatens Zoraida,
and later pleads with her in

00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:03.750
that very dramatic scene when
they leave him behind.

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:06.117
He says: "The scene in
which all of this develops is

00:36:06.117 --> 00:36:08.360
one of the great achievements of
world literature,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:13.103
in the impulse both to curse,
insult and also to cry and

00:36:13.103 --> 00:36:16.155
plead,
Cervantes has portrayed a real

00:36:16.155 --> 00:36:16.989
man."
 

00:36:16.989 --> 00:36:21.096
Unquote--meaning--he's
referring to that very scene,

00:36:21.096 --> 00:36:23.268
that very dramatic scene.
 

00:36:23.268 --> 00:36:25.670
It's the most dramatic scene in
the whole of Part I.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:29.639
Morón Arroyo is also
good when he says,

00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:32.599
quote: "I agree with
Spitzer's definition of

00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:36.360
Cervantean perspectivism [if you
haven't gotten there you will

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.320
when you get to the Spitzer
piece which is,

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.938
I think, the best and most
important in my

00:36:40.938 --> 00:36:41.690
Casebook].
 

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:46.668
In terms of morals,
however, Cervantes is in no way

00:36:46.668 --> 00:36:50.485
a perspectivist"
He says, and in a note he

00:36:50.485 --> 00:36:53.682
adds--Ciriaco Morón
Arroyo: "Perhaps we ought

00:36:53.682 --> 00:36:56.536
to point out here that
perspectivism is inherent in

00:36:56.536 --> 00:36:57.849
Christian thought.
 

00:36:57.849 --> 00:37:02.052
Perspectivism in the sense of a
form of modesty that recognizes

00:37:02.052 --> 00:37:05.780
the limits of all judgment and
human knowledge is indeed

00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:09.235
Christian humility and
intelligence in its strictest

00:37:09.235 --> 00:37:10.050
sense.
 

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:13.409
The capacity to perceive the
limit of our own creations,

00:37:13.409 --> 00:37:16.518
i.e., 'ironea' [then he
puts in the word in the Greek,

00:37:16.518 --> 00:37:18.789
the original word for
irony]."

00:37:18.789 --> 00:37:22.045
But Morón Arroyo is at
his best when he points out

00:37:22.045 --> 00:37:25.476
referring to one critic called
González López:

00:37:25.476 --> 00:37:28.791
"I find magnificent his
observation that the marriage

00:37:28.791 --> 00:37:32.652
between the captive and Zoraida,
the new Christian is accepted

00:37:32.652 --> 00:37:35.784
by the audience at the inn by
the oidor [the judge]

00:37:35.784 --> 00:37:38.751
who has no allusion to the
impurity of blood that could

00:37:38.751 --> 00:37:40.179
result from it."
 

00:37:40.179 --> 00:37:42.476
And this is true,
once she converts to

00:37:42.476 --> 00:37:45.764
Christianity there is no
impediment for them to marry,

00:37:45.764 --> 00:37:48.929
and there is no stigma attached
to their issue;

00:37:48.929 --> 00:37:52.438
although, of course,
there were, in the Spain of the

00:37:52.438 --> 00:37:55.730
time,
stigmas attached to having

00:37:55.730 --> 00:38:00.750
Moorish or Jewish blood,
but here there is no inkling of

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:01.559
it at all.
 

00:38:01.559 --> 00:38:04.804
And he's also very good,
I think, when he points out:

00:38:04.804 --> 00:38:08.112
"The Lingua franca of
berberie is the most

00:38:08.112 --> 00:38:11.668
beautiful expression of the
efforts to communicate in that

00:38:11.668 --> 00:38:12.980
confused world.
 

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:16.505
The story of the captive
demonstrates without any doubt

00:38:16.505 --> 00:38:19.706
that primeval state of
communication in which hman

00:38:19.706 --> 00:38:22.710
beings create a language if
there is none.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:25.789
Algiers is an experiment with
secular communication;

00:38:25.789 --> 00:38:29.945
the renegade love and language
are its fundamental forms of

00:38:29.945 --> 00:38:33.382
expression,"
meaning the renegade and all of

00:38:33.382 --> 00:38:36.965
these characters who speak this
"mongrel"

00:38:36.965 --> 00:38:39.791
quote/unquote,
language made up of all of the

00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:43.277
languages,
and that he says is a form of

00:38:43.277 --> 00:38:48.583
the expression of this human
overcoming of linguistic

00:38:48.583 --> 00:38:53.554
barriers,
because of their love and their

00:38:53.554 --> 00:38:58.139
desire to communicate with each
other.

00:38:58.139 --> 00:39:03.840
In terms of the captive's tale,
I would emphasize that Zoraida

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.420
is a woman of action,
that she is indeed very much

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.010
like Dorotea.
 

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.469
I mean, she's the one who
orchestrates the whole thing,

00:39:13.469 --> 00:39:16.610
who gets the money for the
escape and so forth.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:21.380
She is like Dorotea,
who chooses her destiny,

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:25.559
in her are combined figures of
the renegade,

00:39:25.559 --> 00:39:29.922
the saint, and the seductress,
and Agi Morato is perhaps the

00:39:29.922 --> 00:39:34.579
most dramatic and well-rounded
secondary character of Part I.

00:39:34.579 --> 00:39:38.949
His despair at losing his
daughter,

00:39:38.949 --> 00:39:43.239
his plea to her woving,
to accept her and his vowing,

00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:47.195
to accept her back on her own
terms is full of pathos and of

00:39:47.195 --> 00:39:50.034
tragic death,
in this I agree with Ciriaco

00:39:50.034 --> 00:39:53.436
Morón Arroyo and
underline the fact that this is

00:39:53.436 --> 00:39:56.018
a very important character in
Part I,

00:39:56.018 --> 00:39:58.592
perhaps as I said,
the most important second

00:39:58.592 --> 00:40:01.105
character,
the most dramatic perhaps of

00:40:01.105 --> 00:40:03.768
the whole book parts one and two
included.

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:09.043
Now, we move to a very strange
episode, I want to move to a

00:40:09.043 --> 00:40:13.498
very strange episode,
Don Quixote hanging from the

00:40:13.498 --> 00:40:14.500
window.
 

00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:21.846
That its a very strange episode
for which I have an explanation

00:40:21.846 --> 00:40:25.201
of sorts;
I have never been able to

00:40:25.201 --> 00:40:29.210
explain to myself this episode,
which is, of course,

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:32.853
Maritornes and the innkeeper's
daughter having fun at the

00:40:32.853 --> 00:40:35.260
expense of Don Quixote--
remember?

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.583
That Don Quixote had been
aroused by the innkeeper's

00:40:37.583 --> 00:40:39.556
daughter,
and that he had actually

00:40:39.556 --> 00:40:42.230
grabbed Maritornes and pulled
her into bed,

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:44.869
bad smell and all,
and all of that.

00:40:44.869 --> 00:40:49.835
So they are,
in a sense, getting back at him

00:40:49.835 --> 00:40:56.994
here with this rather cruel joke
of having him hanging from the

00:40:56.994 --> 00:41:02.188
window--
This seems to be a distorted

00:41:02.188 --> 00:41:05.083
version,
a perversion on the part of

00:41:05.083 --> 00:41:08.210
Maritornes and the innkeeper's
daughter of scenes in the

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.240
captive's tale,
as if every important episode

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:14.268
had to be projected in a
different register.

00:41:14.268 --> 00:41:16.315
Follow me in this,
if you will,

00:41:16.315 --> 00:41:18.429
I don't have to persuade you.
 

00:41:18.429 --> 00:41:22.458
At the baño--
remember, that's what they call

00:41:22.458 --> 00:41:25.000
the area where the captives are
kept--

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.969
the captive sees a hand through
a windowâ€“Remember?

00:41:29.969 --> 00:41:34.492
He sees the hand of Zoraida,
it turns out--and there is an

00:41:34.492 --> 00:41:39.489
exchange of messages with that
hand through that high window.

00:41:39.489 --> 00:41:45.150
The window and the hand
reappear in this episode.

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:49.210
The relationship has no
connection in the action,

00:41:49.210 --> 00:41:52.764
in the plot,
it is just simply a remembered

00:41:52.764 --> 00:41:53.610
image.
 

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:58.876
To me it's like a symphonic
motif, a motif repeated and

00:41:58.876 --> 00:42:02.289
expanded upon in a different
key.

00:42:02.289 --> 00:42:05.090
I don't know if I can convince
you of this,

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:10.320
but it's the only way that I
can explain this episode,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:14.702
that there are echoes and
remembrances of this window and

00:42:14.702 --> 00:42:16.360
this hand,
and all of that,

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.481
that they appear here,
and again, it's like a musical

00:42:19.481 --> 00:42:22.219
motif in a symphony that is
repeated.

00:42:22.219 --> 00:42:26.079
Otherwise, it's simply another
act of cruelty against Don

00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:30.010
Quixote of which there quite a
few throughout the book.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:33.516
And you could make all kinds of
symbolic and allegorical

00:42:33.516 --> 00:42:35.592
readings of it;
that he's hanging from the

00:42:35.592 --> 00:42:37.809
window and his feet are just
barely touching the ground,

00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:42.039
he can't quite touch it,
and in a way you can say that

00:42:42.039 --> 00:42:45.550
that is Don Quixote's state in
the world,

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:50.311
that he's in midair,
just barely touching the ground

00:42:50.311 --> 00:42:54.590
with his feet and all of that;
it's possible.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:43:01.221
But I'd propose this reading of
it, as bizarre as it may be an

00:43:01.221 --> 00:43:03.070
interpretation.
 

00:43:03.070 --> 00:43:06.384
Now, I said at the end of my
last lecture,

00:43:06.384 --> 00:43:10.507
and I repeat it today,
that we are coming to the end

00:43:10.507 --> 00:43:11.639
of Part I.
 

00:43:11.639 --> 00:43:17.032
Don't forget that Cervantes had
no idea at this point that he

00:43:17.032 --> 00:43:21.646
would write a Part II,
so this would be the conclusion

00:43:21.646 --> 00:43:24.550
of the novel that he began to
write,

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:29.804
probably, as we saw,
he began to write the novel

00:43:29.804 --> 00:43:33.829
after Don Quixote's second
sally,

00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:37.817
after the scrutiny of the books
and his having engaged Sancho as

00:43:37.817 --> 00:43:38.639
his squire.
 

00:43:38.639 --> 00:43:42.429
Because the two parts are bound
together,

00:43:42.429 --> 00:43:45.463
you may not have the sense that
you are coming to an end because

00:43:45.463 --> 00:43:47.679
you have another big chunk of
book to read,

00:43:47.679 --> 00:43:52.210
but this is the end of Part I
that we're coming to,

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:56.501
and it was the end of the novel
Cervantes set out to write or

00:43:56.501 --> 00:43:57.860
wound up writing.
 

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:03.170
Now, the sense of endings in
fiction is crucial,

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:06.601
as Frank Kermode established in
his wonderful book The Sense

00:44:06.601 --> 00:44:09.329
of an Ending,
that I recommend to everyone.

00:44:09.329 --> 00:44:13.387
Frank Kermode,
k-e-r-m-o-d-e,

00:44:13.387 --> 00:44:17.300
Sir Frank Kermode by now.
 

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:21.123
The ending invites us to read
retrospectively into the story

00:44:21.123 --> 00:44:25.139
that precedes it and suggests an
author's conception of history

00:44:25.139 --> 00:44:29.349
and of the loop of life,
as it were, as his characters

00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:33.918
meet benign or violent deaths,
as conflicts are resolved,

00:44:33.918 --> 00:44:38.070
and as a feeling of completion
is felt by the reader.

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.728
In Aristotle's
Poetics, about

00:44:40.728 --> 00:44:44.210
which we will be talking soon
when we meet the Cannon of

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.445
Toledo,
the Poetics establish

00:44:47.445 --> 00:44:51.592
how plots should be ordered,
linking beginnings with ends

00:44:51.592 --> 00:44:52.820
and both with middles.
 

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:56.063
Cervantes had that in mind,
but also the endings of

00:44:56.063 --> 00:44:58.920
chivalric romances and
picaresque novels,

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.460
in which the plot essentially
followed by the development of

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.800
the hero's life from birth to
death,

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:09.402
or to the point at which the
pícaro began to

00:45:09.402 --> 00:45:11.197
write,
which involved the death and

00:45:11.197 --> 00:45:13.659
resurrection,
a conversion.

00:45:13.659 --> 00:45:18.059
But the Quixote is neither.
 

00:45:18.059 --> 00:45:22.150
In fact, it is not a chivalric
romance, it is not a picaresque;

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:24.320
it was totally new.
 

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.271
At best it could be said--sand
I repeat this--that it,

00:45:28.271 --> 00:45:32.521
is the parody of a chivalric
romance, hence a deliberately

00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:34.610
distorted version of it.
 

00:45:34.610 --> 00:45:37.242
As such, it is a kind of a
meta-chivalric romance,

00:45:37.242 --> 00:45:39.768
a chivalric romance about
chivalric romances.

00:45:39.768 --> 00:45:48.507
So ending it will be no easy
matter for Cervantes as we shall

00:45:48.507 --> 00:45:57.538
see, at least two strands of the
plot are closed in episodes at

00:45:57.538 --> 00:46:01.179
Juan Palomeque's inn.
 

00:46:01.179 --> 00:46:08.184
This is done by appealing to
the judicial or legal cast of

00:46:08.184 --> 00:46:11.530
the novel which,
as we have seen,

00:46:11.530 --> 00:46:15.195
involves the perpetration of
crimes and misdemeanors by the

00:46:15.195 --> 00:46:18.418
protagonist and by the implied
or actual presence of

00:46:18.418 --> 00:46:22.570
representatives of the state,
in this case, the Crown.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:26.869
So the first sort of
conclusion, or conclusions,

00:46:26.869 --> 00:46:29.840
that we have here,
have to do with resolutions,

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:35.309
restorations and the capture
and arrest of Don Quixote.

00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:40.579
I pause here to explain why
this turn to the legal,

00:46:40.579 --> 00:46:44.056
which I have explained in
further detail in my book called

00:46:44.056 --> 00:46:47.289
Love and the Law in
Cervantes published by Yale

00:46:47.289 --> 00:46:49.315
Press,
and which is in your

00:46:49.315 --> 00:46:52.228
bibliography,
and of which I give you a very

00:46:52.228 --> 00:46:56.431
brief synopsis here so that you
can understand why I read these

00:46:56.431 --> 00:46:59.012
endings,
the endings of these episodes

00:46:59.012 --> 00:46:59.969
in this fashion.
 

00:46:59.969 --> 00:47:05.019
I have maintained in that book
that the picaresque and hence

00:47:05.019 --> 00:47:10.327
Cervantes's novel reflects the
importance of the elaboration of

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:15.121
a dense and complicated legal
system in sixteenth century

00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:16.150
Spain.
 

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:19.570
You may have observed some of
these while reading Elliott.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:24.085
This increase was part in due
to the development of the

00:47:24.085 --> 00:47:28.067
printing press,
which made the issuance and

00:47:28.067 --> 00:47:31.369
dissemination of laws much
easier,

00:47:31.369 --> 00:47:36.302
and also the development of a
modern state organized as a

00:47:36.302 --> 00:47:41.411
bureaucracy to administer the
precariously united peninsula

00:47:41.411 --> 00:47:44.320
and its vast overseas empire.
 

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:49.016
If you have read Elliott,
you understand that Spain was a

00:47:49.016 --> 00:47:51.449
modern state in the making.
 

00:47:51.449 --> 00:47:55.380
Normally, Americans have a
sense of Spain as backward,

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:59.309
but no, Spain here was at the
forefront of history.

00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:03.673
This situation brought about
the creation and maintenance of

00:48:03.673 --> 00:48:06.929
state archives in which myriads
of cases,

00:48:06.929 --> 00:48:10.449
both criminal and civil,
were kept and classified.

00:48:10.449 --> 00:48:14.657
The distinction criminal and
civil was not quite established

00:48:14.657 --> 00:48:17.440
as such, although in practice it
was.

00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:24.481
A criminal act is against the
state, in this case against the

00:48:24.481 --> 00:48:27.327
Crown;
a civil crime is committed

00:48:27.327 --> 00:48:30.190
against somebody else,
another person.

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:35.880
So the archive was a form of
state control containing many

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:41.271
stories from which the
picaresque novel derived or drew

00:48:41.271 --> 00:48:44.016
its cases,
like the one involved in

00:48:44.016 --> 00:48:46.250
Lazarillo and
Guzmán.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:49.606
Lazarillo's story is like a
deposition given to a judge to

00:48:49.606 --> 00:48:51.610
justify his present predicament.
 

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:55.590
He is the husband of an
archpriest's mistress.

00:48:55.590 --> 00:49:00.983
Legal discourse made possible
the minute description of the

00:49:00.983 --> 00:49:06.469
real as opposed to Renaissance
genres like the pastoral,

00:49:06.469 --> 00:49:10.909
which gave an ideal description
of the world.

00:49:10.909 --> 00:49:13.327
Legal discourse is,
in my theory,

00:49:13.327 --> 00:49:17.692
the foundation of the novel,
a narrative that deals in the

00:49:17.692 --> 00:49:19.844
beginning,
mostly with criminals like

00:49:19.844 --> 00:49:21.969
Ginés de Pasamonte and
Lazarillo,

00:49:21.969 --> 00:49:23.969
and continues to deal with
criminals,

00:49:23.969 --> 00:49:30.170
and that describes as only
legal documents can describe the

00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:33.268
business of every day life.
 

00:49:33.268 --> 00:49:37.306
The intertwined stories of Part
I involving legal issues,

00:49:37.306 --> 00:49:41.849
mostly focusing on testamentary
law read like cases taken out of

00:49:41.849 --> 00:49:43.219
those archives.
 

00:49:43.219 --> 00:49:46.983
Not so The Novel of the
Curious Impertinent that is

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:50.018
obviously drawn from Renaissance
Literature.

00:49:50.018 --> 00:49:55.119
In its protagonist,
who is a fugitive from justice,

00:49:55.119 --> 00:49:58.465
an outlaw, Cervantes has
created the first important

00:49:58.465 --> 00:50:01.679
novelistic protagonist drawn
from the archive,

00:50:01.679 --> 00:50:03.268
as it were.
 

00:50:03.268 --> 00:50:07.521
His is the case of the insane
hidalgo who set out to

00:50:07.521 --> 00:50:11.699
act out chivalric fantasies and
in the process committed a

00:50:11.699 --> 00:50:13.239
series of crimes.
 

00:50:13.239 --> 00:50:18.954
He is the first hero-fugitive
from justice in the western

00:50:18.954 --> 00:50:20.179
tradition.
 

00:50:20.179 --> 00:50:23.797
In the process,
Cervantes uses settings like

00:50:23.797 --> 00:50:28.246
the despoblado,
that I have explained here,

00:50:28.246 --> 00:50:32.349
drawn from Spanish law,
and in the Holy Brotherhood has

00:50:32.349 --> 00:50:35.400
drawn into the fiction the
police of the times,

00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:39.978
the depiction of a real world
for Cervantes involved a world

00:50:39.978 --> 00:50:43.159
held together precariously by
the law,

00:50:43.159 --> 00:50:47.655
and whose representation could
not be accomplished without

00:50:47.655 --> 00:50:50.969
recourse to legal language and
concepts.

00:50:50.969 --> 00:50:55.154
All of the situations in the
Quixote are framed within

00:50:55.154 --> 00:50:56.409
legal discourse.
 

00:50:56.409 --> 00:51:01.780
This is the reason why endings
begin with resolutions,

00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:04.550
restorations and the capture of
Don Quixote--

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:09.016
to get back to these endings
that I'm going to now describe

00:51:09.016 --> 00:51:11.789
and analyze these partial
endings.

00:51:11.789 --> 00:51:14.873
The episodes at the end,
towards the end of Part I are

00:51:14.873 --> 00:51:17.260
the climax of the first
Quixote.

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.759
Don Quixote's defeat of
Pandafilando is the culmination

00:51:20.759 --> 00:51:23.739
of his adventures,
his most resounding feat.

00:51:23.739 --> 00:51:26.693
These adventures,
for all of their humor and in

00:51:26.693 --> 00:51:29.389
spite of Don Quixote's
ridiculous behavior,

00:51:29.389 --> 00:51:32.150
are successful in bringing
about peace;

00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:34.239
Dorotea admits as much.
 

00:51:34.239 --> 00:51:36.880
Don Quixote is not an angelic
Beatrice,

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:40.849
whom the pilgrim meets in
the Divine Comedy towards

00:51:40.849 --> 00:51:44.820
the end of Purgatorio as he
readies to enter Paradiso,

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:46.869
nor an epic hero,
like Aeneas,

00:51:46.869 --> 00:51:50.661
who winds up founding Rome,
but he does bring about peace

00:51:50.661 --> 00:51:54.201
and justice in the world,
that is has been his lot to be

00:51:54.201 --> 00:51:55.059
thrown into.
 

00:51:55.059 --> 00:51:58.606
This is, as I have said
earlier, part of the overall

00:51:58.606 --> 00:52:02.014
irony of the book,
that such a preposterous figure

00:52:02.014 --> 00:52:04.170
is the agent of Providence.
 

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:07.804
Through his intervention,
Don Fernando agrees to marry

00:52:07.804 --> 00:52:10.884
Dorotea and make good,
on the promise that he made her

00:52:10.884 --> 00:52:13.260
the night he stole into her room
and deflowered her,

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:17.023
swearing to become her husband;
Luscinda is returned to

00:52:17.023 --> 00:52:21.150
Cardenio, who had been wronged
both by her and by Don Fernando.

00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:25.538
Crossed marriage vows bring
these conflicts to a happy

00:52:25.538 --> 00:52:29.032
comedy like ending,
but such elevated kind of

00:52:29.032 --> 00:52:33.112
justice is not the only kind of
finale that takes place

00:52:33.112 --> 00:52:34.050
at the end.
 

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:37.733
Resolution also takes place at
a legal level in the most

00:52:37.733 --> 00:52:41.782
concrete and minute fashion,
as restitution is made to those

00:52:41.782 --> 00:52:45.603
who have suffered injuries or
damages and are owed money as a

00:52:45.603 --> 00:52:46.239
result.
 

00:52:46.239 --> 00:52:50.632
Don Fernando and the priest
compensate the second barber and

00:52:50.632 --> 00:52:53.010
the innkeeper,
who had been complaining about

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:54.530
all of the destruction to his
business,

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:57.952
not to mention the consumption
by the knight and his squire and

00:52:57.952 --> 00:52:58.780
their mounts.
 

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:03.610
The second barber had had his
basin stolen and dented and his

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:06.429
donkey's harness had been
stolen.

00:53:06.429 --> 00:53:12.333
Financial restitutions such as
these are a form of closure

00:53:12.333 --> 00:53:14.510
drawn from the law.
 

00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:20.420
It is what 'making whole' means
in current legal terminology.

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:24.532
An individual is brought back
to the state he or she was in

00:53:24.532 --> 00:53:26.590
before the damage occurred.
 

00:53:26.590 --> 00:53:31.365
Restitution is the ending to a
story that began with harm and

00:53:31.365 --> 00:53:34.789
the decrease of one's property
or wealth.

00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:36.945
Don Quixote,
for his part,

00:53:36.945 --> 00:53:41.170
is finally apprehended by the
Holy Brotherhood.

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:44.842
This is part of the all of the
encompassing closure of the

00:53:44.842 --> 00:53:45.809
novel's plot.
 

00:53:45.809 --> 00:53:49.467
Don Quixote and Sancho had been
pursued by the Holy Brotherhood

00:53:49.467 --> 00:53:52.949
with an order of arrest for the
knight because of his having

00:53:52.949 --> 00:53:57.280
freed the galley slaves,
as Sancho had feared all along.

00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:00.438
They had committed other crimes
such as killing sheep,

00:54:00.438 --> 00:54:03.657
breaking a man's leg and
stealing property from him and

00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:04.789
his companions.
 

00:54:04.789 --> 00:54:11.123
The trooper reads the arrest
order comparing the description

00:54:11.123 --> 00:54:17.242
in the arrest order with Don
Quixote's features in one the

00:54:17.242 --> 00:54:22.179
most hilarious reading scenes in
the book.

00:54:22.179 --> 00:54:26.556
I'm reading from pages 408,409
of your translation,

00:54:26.556 --> 00:54:31.809
and I hope you have read this
before and laughed as much as I

00:54:31.809 --> 00:54:35.971
do every time I read it:
"But one of them [the

00:54:35.971 --> 00:54:38.132
troopers],
namely, he who had been kicked

00:54:38.132 --> 00:54:40.762
and mauled by Don Fernando,
bethought himself that,

00:54:40.762 --> 00:54:43.621
among some warrants he had
about him for apprehending

00:54:43.621 --> 00:54:46.510
certain delinquents,
he had one against Don Quixote,

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:49.599
whom the Holy Brotherhood had
ordered to be taken into custody

00:54:49.599 --> 00:54:51.880
for setting at liberty the
galley-slaves,

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.809
as Sancho had very justly
feared.

00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:56.769
Having this in his head,
he had a mind to be satisfied,

00:54:56.769 --> 00:54:59.402
whether the person of Don
Quixote answered to the

00:54:59.402 --> 00:55:02.188
description;
and, pulling a parchment out of

00:55:02.188 --> 00:55:05.268
his bosom, he presently found
what he looked for;

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:09.409
and setting himself to read
leisurely--

00:55:09.409 --> 00:55:12.969
for he was not a great
reader--at every word he read,

00:55:12.969 --> 00:55:16.460
he fixed his eyes on Don
Quixote, and then went on,

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.900
comparing the marks in his
warrant with the lines of Don

00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:21.740
Quixote's physiognomy,
and found that without all

00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:24.737
doubt he must be the person
therein described:

00:55:24.737 --> 00:55:26.590
and,
as soon as he had satisfied

00:55:26.590 --> 00:55:28.061
himself,
rolling up the parchment,

00:55:28.061 --> 00:55:29.750
and holding the warrant in his
left hand,

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:33.059
with his right he laid so fast
a hold of Don Quixote by the

00:55:33.059 --> 00:55:35.349
collar,
that he did not suffer him to

00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:37.188
draw breath,
crying out aloud:

00:55:37.188 --> 00:55:38.849
'Help the Holy Brotherhood!
 

00:55:38.849 --> 00:55:42.070
and that everybody may see I
require it in earnest,

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:44.860
read this warrant,
wherein it is expressly

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:48.469
commanded to apprehend this
highway robber.'"

00:55:48.469 --> 00:55:51.610
Unquote.
 

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:54.391
'Highway robber,' that's how
Don Quixote is described and,

00:55:54.391 --> 00:55:55.710
in fact, literally he is.
 

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:57.969
Why is it hilarious?
 

00:55:57.969 --> 00:56:00.976
Because the law should be the
ultimate and most reliable

00:56:00.976 --> 00:56:03.273
institution in the
representation of social

00:56:03.273 --> 00:56:06.190
reality;
particularly of individuals

00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:08.619
entrusted with upholding it!
 

00:56:08.619 --> 00:56:13.099
Yet, its agent is a kind of
dolt who can barely read;

00:56:13.099 --> 00:56:16.387
beyond that,
because the interpretation of

00:56:16.387 --> 00:56:20.956
the real is always problematic
and difficult as is reading

00:56:20.956 --> 00:56:23.728
itself,
and here those difficulties are

00:56:23.728 --> 00:56:25.768
minutely reenacted by the
trooper.

00:56:25.768 --> 00:56:29.942
This is expressed brilliantly
by the trooper looking at each

00:56:29.942 --> 00:56:34.186
feature of Don Quixote's after
reading it in this warrant and

00:56:34.186 --> 00:56:36.518
comparing it with the knight.
 

00:56:36.518 --> 00:56:41.114
Like Velázquez,
checking to see that what he's

00:56:41.114 --> 00:56:46.329
painting corresponds to his
models in Las Meninas.

00:56:46.329 --> 00:56:49.630
It's a very same act,
it's a very same moment.

00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:54.188
Here we have authority's agent
experiencing difficulty

00:56:54.188 --> 00:56:58.759
establishing who a person is,
and with writing,

00:56:58.759 --> 00:57:03.179
experiences with writing,
the very vehicle through which

00:57:03.179 --> 00:57:06.239
the new legislation establishes
its power over individuals.

00:57:06.239 --> 00:57:10.313
One can only imagine how Don
Quixote's description was

00:57:10.313 --> 00:57:14.463
obtained from the guards,
from whom he freed the galley

00:57:14.463 --> 00:57:17.768
slaves taking down notes as they
spoke.

00:57:17.768 --> 00:57:22.769
That is, the whole take on the
trials of representation

00:57:22.769 --> 00:57:27.030
dramatized in this very,
very comical scene.

00:57:27.030 --> 00:57:33.043
So, as you can see,
all of these restitutions are

00:57:33.043 --> 00:57:40.809
part of the closure of the book
that belonged to the legal cast

00:57:40.809 --> 00:57:42.940
of the novel.
 

00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:46.934
But the most important within
that legal cast is the

00:57:46.934 --> 00:57:51.789
apprehension of Don Quixote
himself by the Holy Brotherhood.

00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:55.230
This sort of loops the plot,
as it were.

00:57:55.230 --> 00:58:01.407
But now we will have to see how
and speak about the charade

00:58:01.407 --> 00:58:07.480
organized to cage Don Quixote
and bring him back home,

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:10.659
but we will do that in the next
class.

00:58:10.659 --> 00:58:16.000

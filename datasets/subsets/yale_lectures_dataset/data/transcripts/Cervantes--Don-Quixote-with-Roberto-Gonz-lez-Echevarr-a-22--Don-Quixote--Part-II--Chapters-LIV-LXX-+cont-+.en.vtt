00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.922
Prof: To me,
the most evocative moment in

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:09.813
the Quixote,
as we reach the beautiful city

00:00:09.813 --> 00:00:13.520
of Barcelona,
is the appearance of the sea.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:23.498
The sea suggests the infinite,
as we approach the end,

00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:30.465
and also death:
"Death's dateless

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:37.620
night," to quote
Shakespeare.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:44.969
Castile is landlocked,
and so Spain is defining its

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:54.670
limits, as the novel reaches its
end and defines its own limits.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.940
Don Quixote and Sancho,
most probably,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.120
have never seen the sea,
but Cervantes certainly had,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:15.653
as we know, and he boasts of it
in these last chapters of the

00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:17.549
Quixote.
 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.522
There is all these details
about life in the ships,

00:01:22.522 --> 00:01:26.599
and of the galley slaves,
and all of that,

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:32.170
in which he uses very detailed
maritime terminology.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.842
But Sancho and Don Quixote are
unlikely to have ever seen the

00:01:36.842 --> 00:01:37.310
sea.
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.824
We are not told if they had,
but one, I think,

00:01:41.824 --> 00:01:43.730
should assume so.
 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.512
The novel, which,
as a genre began with the

00:01:48.512 --> 00:01:54.995
Quixote, will be an urban
genre, meaning that it will deal

00:01:54.995 --> 00:02:01.697
mostly with cities;
the settings will nearly always

00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:03.209
be cities.
 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:08.117
Yet, Barcelona is the only city
that appears in the

00:02:08.117 --> 00:02:13.582
Quixote, though Part II
began with a visit to El Toboso,

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:14.878
a village.
 

00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:22.909
Is Don Quixote doing like
Aeneas, who went from Troy to

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.758
Rome,
obviously, not,

00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:31.070
as I said earlier,
such heroic acts are no longer

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:36.453
available to Don Quixote,
heroic and historically

00:02:36.453 --> 00:02:40.990
defining acts are not available
to Don Quixote.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.910
Besides, El Toboso is a mere
village in Spain,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.340
and it endured no war,
like Troy, and Barcelona is not

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:58.217
the culmination of a journey,
and the harbinger of an empire,

00:02:58.217 --> 00:03:02.917
like the Roman,
which the Aeneid

00:03:02.917 --> 00:03:06.000
announces and celebrates.
 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.408
It is significant that,
in contrast,

00:03:08.408 --> 00:03:10.729
to a history,
I'll repeat this,

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:14.438
a history of the novel which is
mainly urban,

00:03:14.438 --> 00:03:18.710
this is the only urban setting
in Don Quixote,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:25.378
but it is urban with a
vengeance, even with its party,

00:03:25.378 --> 00:03:28.135
its own party,
which is a party very much

00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:32.476
something of the city,
and I'm thinking here of Le

00:03:32.476 --> 00:03:37.708
temps retrouvé, which
is the last volume in Marcel

00:03:37.708 --> 00:03:41.283
Proust's À
la recherche du temps

00:03:41.283 --> 00:03:44.115
perdu,
which I hope you get to read

00:03:44.115 --> 00:03:48.379
some day,
in which there are many parties

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.878
in that novel,
and dances, and stuff.

00:03:53.878 --> 00:04:00.209
The first thing that Don
Quixote and Sancho endure in

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.147
Barcelona is public shame,
as when the boys goad Rocinante

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:10.800
into throwing Don Quixote.
 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:17.120
The city will mean public
display, a lot of people.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.663
It is also extremely
significant that Don Quixote and

00:04:21.663 --> 00:04:25.160
Sancho arrive on the eve of San
Juan,

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.680
the night of the eve of San
Juan, that is to say,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.730
they arrive during carnival
time or carnival-like time.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.427
It is as if they had arrived at
a costume party already

00:04:41.427 --> 00:04:47.440
costumed--at a costume ball
already costumed--because they

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.240
are literary characters already.
 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.158
In fact, by this date,
1615, but by the time Cervantes

00:04:58.158 --> 00:05:02.206
is writing this,
1613, probably,

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:10.300
Don Quixote and Sancho had
already appeared in a carnival.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.997
Two men disguised as Don
Quixote and Sancho appeared in a

00:05:14.997 --> 00:05:18.939
carnival, in a town near Lima,
Peru, in 1609.

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:24.810
So Don Quixote and Sancho were
already figures that--

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.163
costumed characters that people
could dress up like in the

00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:32.422
carnival,
and here they are entering into

00:05:32.422 --> 00:05:34.160
a carnival atmosphere.
 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:41.959
The city of Barcelona will be a
stage for various festivals and

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:45.860
theater-like representations.
 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.964
The city is carnival,
it is theater,

00:05:50.964 --> 00:05:58.548
it is acting out roles,
it is the opposite of nature,

00:05:58.548 --> 00:06:00.588
it is art.
 

00:06:00.588 --> 00:06:08.149
Here, we have literary genres
compressed and staged,

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:13.882
like the Byzantine romance,
and the novela morisca

00:06:13.882 --> 00:06:18.490
that I explained about in the
last lecture.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:25.305
Now, the Byzantine romance
aspect or representation I

00:06:25.305 --> 00:06:31.990
already mentioned is also called
a Greek romance;

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.654
this mini Greek romance,
which winds up Ricote's,

00:06:37.654 --> 00:06:40.839
Ana's and Gaspar's story.
 

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:45.446
Cervantes has compressed all of
the elements of the Byzantine

00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:48.209
romance in the story:
abductions,

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:52.668
sea voyages,
sea battles,

00:06:52.668 --> 00:07:01.495
people in costume,
and it is also a reprise

00:07:01.495 --> 00:07:07.329
of the captive's tale,
with a good ending,

00:07:07.329 --> 00:07:11.579
however, promised to the Muslim
father.

00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:16.430
I repeat what I said in the
last lecture that,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.346
at this time,
Cervantes is working on his own

00:07:19.346 --> 00:07:22.009
Byzantine romance,
The Trials of Persiles y

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:25.699
Sigismunda,
so it is not surprising that he

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:31.850
should include elements of it in
this part of the Quixote.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:37.468
The new novelistic genre that
Cervantes is creating is a

00:07:37.468 --> 00:07:40.839
compendium of narrative genres.
 

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:45.666
Remember that,
to me, the most interesting

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:52.733
aspect of this mini Byzantine
romance is when Gaspar Gregorio

00:07:52.733 --> 00:07:59.209
is dressed as a woman so as to
be less attractive to his

00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:01.800
Turkish captors.
 

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:05.079
It's kind of a baroque kind of
transvestitism;

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:08.899
or transvestitism sort of
turned around.

00:08:08.899 --> 00:08:13.870
Now, that story of Gaspar
Gregorio and Ana is not

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.290
concluded, there is no closure.
 

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.709
The reason may be that this is
the only love story that has a

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:25.634
social political connection;
the whole business of the

00:08:25.634 --> 00:08:29.615
expulsion of the moriscos
and the returning to Spain

00:08:29.615 --> 00:08:30.920
against the law.
 

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:36.287
That is, this is not just a
story, but part of ongoing

00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:37.298
history.
 

00:08:37.298 --> 00:08:41.893
The novel, that is,
the novel Don Quixote,

00:08:41.893 --> 00:08:46.678
like the character,
is coming closer to reality not

00:08:46.678 --> 00:08:50.889
to the demands of fiction or of
madness.

00:08:50.889 --> 00:08:53.907
Perhaps closure,
other than death,

00:08:53.907 --> 00:08:57.200
is only available in those
realms.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.066
That is, closure is only
available perhaps in fiction,

00:09:02.066 --> 00:09:05.738
which it has its rounded
completed forms,

00:09:05.738 --> 00:09:09.870
whereas ongoing time cannot
have closure.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.292
Perhaps closure is possible,
then, only in fiction,

00:09:14.292 --> 00:09:17.298
or within Don Quixote's
madness.

00:09:17.298 --> 00:09:20.792
I continue to worry about the
ending of the novel,

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:24.568
with the impending ending of
the novel which must have

00:09:24.568 --> 00:09:27.990
worried Cervantes a lot as he
moved forward.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:33.895
Now, is Cervantes presenting a
falsified Spain with these

00:09:33.895 --> 00:09:40.645
well-to-do citizens of Barcelona
and government officials who are

00:09:40.645 --> 00:09:45.076
so lenient with the
moriscos and the

00:09:45.076 --> 00:09:49.509
renegades,
or is it the Spain that he

00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:51.440
would like to see?
 

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.370
We will never know,
but, on the whole,

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:58.409
there is leniency shown here,
even by the government

00:09:58.409 --> 00:10:02.450
officials who are breaking the
law in doing so.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:09.500
Now, further activities in
Barcelona take place at the

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.960
house of Antonio Moreno.
 

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.167
Antonio Moreno,
a character--I'm sure that you

00:10:16.167 --> 00:10:20.586
have remarked upon--and several
social events take place at his

00:10:20.586 --> 00:10:21.298
house.
 

00:10:21.298 --> 00:10:26.178
His house is now the setting
for the action,

00:10:26.178 --> 00:10:28.548
but we have left,
and will return,

00:10:28.548 --> 00:10:31.058
to the duke and duchess's
house,

00:10:31.058 --> 00:10:33.517
but now it's in Antonio
Moreno's house that these

00:10:33.517 --> 00:10:35.360
events,
these social events take place.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.149
Here we have depicted the
pleasures of the

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:41.090
bourgeoisie.
 

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.400
This is not quite a
bourgeoisie,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.832
it is higher than the
bourgeoisie,

00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:48.995
it announces the emergence of
the bourgeoisie,

00:10:48.995 --> 00:10:50.029
as a class.
 

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:55.739
Now, so the events here are not
quite as elaborate or ornate as

00:10:55.739 --> 00:11:00.620
the ones at the duke and
duchess' palace mentioned.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.533
But there is a dance,
in which Don Quixote displays

00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:08.605
skills, such as dancing,
that we did not know that he

00:11:08.605 --> 00:11:12.129
possessed, or imagined that he
possessed.

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:18.330
They bespeak of a past that
Cervantes chose not to fill out.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:20.799
Where did Don Quixote learn to
dance?

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:23.298
Where did he dance?
 

00:11:23.298 --> 00:11:26.528
Just as we learned in the
episode of the boat,

00:11:26.528 --> 00:11:30.403
that he knows how to swim:
how did he ever learn how to

00:11:30.403 --> 00:11:31.048
swim?
 

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:37.309
We are not given any details
about this past of Don Quixote;

00:11:37.309 --> 00:11:38.908
we could imagine it.
 

00:11:38.908 --> 00:11:42.750
He acts, here,
like an accomplished courtesan.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:47.647
He is, as when he is at the
duke and duchess' house,

00:11:47.647 --> 00:11:52.928
the object of entertainment,
but not of cruel pranks.

00:11:52.928 --> 00:11:56.450
I mean, here,
these bored bourgeoisie

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.398
have parties,
and suddenly a literary

00:11:59.398 --> 00:12:04.090
character emerges among them;
it is a godsend to them.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:07.590
Imagine, you're having a party
and James Bond shows up.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.940
Wow!
 

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:12.176
Everybody is excited;
and this is what happens at

00:12:12.176 --> 00:12:13.048
this party.
 

00:12:13.048 --> 00:12:22.381
Now, the talking head caper,
which is reminiscent of the

00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:29.000
Master Peter episode and his
monkey,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.216
remember the monkey who could
divine what is happening to

00:12:33.216 --> 00:12:36.990
people,
is making--I mean,

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:45.881
the whole prank centers on
making literal a rhetorical

00:12:45.881 --> 00:12:47.558
figure.
 

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:51.565
Remember, I mentioned that
Antonomasia was a rhetorical

00:12:51.565 --> 00:12:55.644
figure, the name of the young
woman in an earlier story,

00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:58.389
and now we have another one
here.

00:12:58.389 --> 00:13:10.178
Here we have prosopopeia.
 

00:13:10.178 --> 00:13:11.720
"Prosopopeya"
in Spanish;

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.710
"prosopopeia"
in English.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.340
The definition of prosopopeia
is:

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:22.572
"a figure in rhetoric in
which things are represented as

00:13:22.572 --> 00:13:27.107
persons or by which things
inanimate are spoken of as

00:13:27.107 --> 00:13:31.418
animated beings,
or by which an absent person is

00:13:31.418 --> 00:13:35.980
introduced as speaking or a
deceased person is represented

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.340
as alive and present,
a kind of personification."

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:44.090
That's the end of the
definition.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:48.568
You have prosopopeia,
of course, when you have a

00:13:48.568 --> 00:13:52.666
ventriloquist,
with his puppet that he makes

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:56.860
speak, or projects his voice and
speaks.

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.360
So that is what prosopopeia is.
 

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.945
So Cervantes here,
as he does in other occasions,

00:14:02.945 --> 00:14:07.798
is hinting at the disconnection
of language from signification.

00:14:07.798 --> 00:14:15.070
It is a staging of pure voice
without a source.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:22.846
Also, he is playfully
presenting the inner world of

00:14:22.846 --> 00:14:29.070
man as being made up of wood and
tin,

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:39.889
because the bust is made of
wood, made to look like stone,

00:14:39.889 --> 00:14:42.654
or marble, or whatever,
and the whole apparatus through

00:14:42.654 --> 00:14:45.158
which the student,
who is the assistant,

00:14:45.158 --> 00:14:49.210
in this case,
speaks, is made of tin.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:53.230
So here, other than
prosopopeia, there is a hint

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:57.678
that Cervantes is showing well
the inside of man,

00:14:57.678 --> 00:15:02.403
is just like this piece of wood
with a tin tube through which

00:15:02.403 --> 00:15:03.980
the voice emerges.
 

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:09.269
So it's, again,
one of these episodes that has

00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:14.090
all kinds of philosophical
suggestions.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:19.839
But the most suggestive episode
in Barcelona is the visit to the

00:15:19.839 --> 00:15:21.298
printing shop.
 

00:15:21.298 --> 00:15:27.750
Now, this is the acme of
self-reflectivity.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.099
It is as if,
jokingly, Don Quixote were

00:15:31.099 --> 00:15:35.860
visiting his true origin in the
most material sense.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.335
Don Quixote,
a character who emerged from

00:15:40.335 --> 00:15:46.600
books, is at the place where
books are literally made;

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:53.457
it is a kind of reductio ad
absurdum because literature

00:15:53.457 --> 00:15:58.967
cannot be reduced to the
material status of paper,

00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:05.166
ink and glue;
what you make a book with,

00:16:05.166 --> 00:16:06.980
of course.
 

00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:11.525
But Cervantes is delving into
the very basic building blocks

00:16:11.525 --> 00:16:15.552
of his craft,
aware that these,

00:16:15.552 --> 00:16:21.724
that is, the apparatus,
the machinery to make the book

00:16:21.724 --> 00:16:25.370
and all of that are mere
concrete manifestations of it

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.153
that cannot be its real origin,
its real source,

00:16:29.153 --> 00:16:31.470
but he is playing with it.
 

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:33.461
The episode,
this episode,

00:16:33.461 --> 00:16:38.160
must be seen in relation to the
scrutiny of the books and to

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:43.025
Altisidora's dream or vision,
about which I will speak later

00:16:43.025 --> 00:16:43.529
today.
 

00:16:43.529 --> 00:16:48.292
They all deal with the question
of the book, the visit to the

00:16:48.292 --> 00:16:51.784
printing shop,
I repeat, is the last frontier

00:16:51.784 --> 00:16:53.769
of self-reflectivity.
 

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:58.879
Here is a fictional character
observing the printing of a book

00:16:58.879 --> 00:17:02.563
about him, but the book is an
apocryphal one,

00:17:02.563 --> 00:17:04.910
to add to the confusion.
 

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:08.680
It is Avellaneda's book.
 

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.832
It is a visit to the origin of
all reflections and

00:17:11.832 --> 00:17:12.990
representations.
 

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:19.349
The sign the boys hang on Don
Quixote also reduces him to

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.940
language;
it's a label;

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.900
he is reduced to letters.
 

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:29.009
So Cervantes is taking this to
the very limits.

00:17:29.009 --> 00:17:33.880
Now, Avellaneda's spurious
Quixote,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:41.880
and you have today a handout
with the cover,

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.913
which I may have given you
before, just so that you have it

00:17:44.913 --> 00:17:47.364
as a souvenir;
you can also look at it and

00:17:47.364 --> 00:17:48.920
read it, as best you can.
 

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:59.640
Notice that the esses are made
like this: Tordesillas.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.597
You can read it,
I'm sure, and also the wood cut

00:18:02.597 --> 00:18:05.180
of the knight is also very
interesting.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.593
Avellaneda's spurious
Quixote came to the

00:18:09.593 --> 00:18:13.818
attention of Cervantes when he
was about...

00:18:13.818 --> 00:18:16.608
In chapter XXXVI,
we said, or XXXVII.

00:18:16.608 --> 00:18:23.338
So the moment that he learned
about Avellaneda's book,

00:18:23.338 --> 00:18:26.324
and probably have read it,
he changed Don Quixote's

00:18:26.324 --> 00:18:29.130
destination to Barcelona away
from Saragossa.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.900
Avellaneda's book allows
Cervantes to add yet another

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:35.509
dimension to his play of
illusion.

00:18:35.509 --> 00:18:39.343
Later, he will borrow a
character from the false

00:18:39.343 --> 00:18:44.154
Quixote and make him
swear that he had never seen him

00:18:44.154 --> 00:18:46.548
and Sancho,
seen Don Quixote and Sancho.

00:18:46.548 --> 00:18:50.210
You will see that as we get to
the very end.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:54.060
This is a parody,
that legal document that he

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.548
makes him sign.
 

00:18:55.548 --> 00:18:56.448
Can you imagine?
 

00:18:56.448 --> 00:18:59.142
A legal document,
a fictional character is making

00:18:59.142 --> 00:19:01.555
another one sign saying,
of course, that he,

00:19:01.555 --> 00:19:04.528
the one giving him the document
is the real one.

00:19:04.528 --> 00:19:10.256
It's a parody of those legal
documents at the origin of the

00:19:10.256 --> 00:19:14.601
constitution of the picaresque,
for instance,

00:19:14.601 --> 00:19:18.650
but there is a great deal more,
here.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:23.255
This is a meta-fictional realm
where characters from two

00:19:23.255 --> 00:19:28.278
different novels can actually
meet and talk to each other.

00:19:28.278 --> 00:19:31.846
The play of illusion,
the blurring of the border

00:19:31.846 --> 00:19:36.171
between fantasy and fiction is
emphasized by these various

00:19:36.171 --> 00:19:40.686
layers of fiction involved,
and by the brilliant move by

00:19:40.686 --> 00:19:44.010
which Cervantes,
by not allowing Don Quixote to

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.309
go to Saragossa,
intends to correct history,

00:19:47.309 --> 00:19:51.294
but, of course,
it's a history that is a

00:19:51.294 --> 00:19:52.288
fiction.
 

00:19:52.288 --> 00:19:57.865
There is no position from which
to stand outside of the world of

00:19:57.865 --> 00:20:03.529
fiction in the Quixote,
because the fiction is manmade;

00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:06.528
it is all that we can know.
 

00:20:06.528 --> 00:20:12.940
In a way, and I have mentioned
this before, this anticipates

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:18.480
the philosophy of the great
Italian philosopher Gian

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.608
Battista Vico,
eighteenth century.

00:20:22.608 --> 00:20:26.410
The New Science is the
name of his wonderful book.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:32.773
One of Vico's main ideas was
that mankind can only understand

00:20:32.773 --> 00:20:37.750
what mankind has made;
therefore, he begins his

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:43.728
history of humanity after the
flood, when it is mankind that

00:20:43.728 --> 00:20:47.680
remakes the world,
not with Genesis.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.106
And what I'm saying here is
that this world of fiction is

00:20:54.106 --> 00:20:56.929
manmade,
and it is all that we can

00:20:56.929 --> 00:21:01.818
understand,
so the modern self that emerges

00:21:01.818 --> 00:21:08.528
from this vision is a very light
and fragile one,

00:21:08.528 --> 00:21:12.605
like Hamlet's,
or like the one proposed by

00:21:12.605 --> 00:21:17.077
Milan Kundera in The
Unbearable Likeness of

00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:22.900
Being,
a novel that I suggest you read.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:26.430
It is a modern self devoid of
certainties,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.470
certainly about himself,
or herself,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:33.568
because the feeling that this
mise en abîme,

00:21:33.568 --> 00:21:37.230
this infinitely receding
sequence creates,

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:40.608
is that, if anything envelopes
our world,

00:21:40.608 --> 00:21:44.269
if anything contains our world,
it may yet be another fiction.

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:47.787
This is the cervantean
borgesian, Borges,

00:21:47.787 --> 00:21:51.130
I'm referring to Jorge Louis
Borges.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:55.363
This is a cervantean borgesian
predicament, in which we find

00:21:55.363 --> 00:21:59.021
ourselves and from which you
cannot escape in the

00:21:59.021 --> 00:22:00.170
Quixote.
 

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:04.656
It is what we saw in the Las
Meninas, when we

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.519
visited Velázquez's
studio,

00:22:07.519 --> 00:22:11.055
and by watching,
we became a part of the fiction

00:22:11.055 --> 00:22:12.410
of the painting.
 

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.654
And the visit,
the visit to the printing shop

00:22:15.654 --> 00:22:19.858
is like the visit to that studio
of Velázquez's;

00:22:19.858 --> 00:22:23.890
this is the shop where fiction
is made.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.987
The only way out of this
predicament is by an act of

00:22:27.987 --> 00:22:31.114
will,
like the one that Don Quixote

00:22:31.114 --> 00:22:35.548
performs at the end,
when he very artily spurns all

00:22:35.548 --> 00:22:40.816
of the seductions and all of the
consolations that his comrades

00:22:40.816 --> 00:22:43.618
offer him as he is near death.
 

00:22:43.618 --> 00:22:47.702
His is an act of faith and a
voluntary one,

00:22:47.702 --> 00:22:50.230
not an intellectual one.
 

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:56.863
Moreover, Avellaneda and his
Quixote may also

00:22:56.863 --> 00:23:04.278
represent a misreading of
Cervantes' Quixote by the

00:23:04.278 --> 00:23:07.400
society of his time.
 

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:15.002
Avellaneda's Quixote
presents a character that is

00:23:15.002 --> 00:23:19.980
essentially ridiculous and
funny,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.828
and a Sancho who is a glutton
and a drunk,

00:23:23.828 --> 00:23:30.203
so it is the vision of the
Quixote as essentially a

00:23:30.203 --> 00:23:34.015
funny book,
a misreading that has been

00:23:34.015 --> 00:23:38.419
repeated in recent times by the
so called "hard

00:23:38.419 --> 00:23:42.910
school" of critics of
Cervantes in England,

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.931
that I said that the only hard
thing about it is the hardening

00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:52.460
of the critical arteries:
Peter Russell and company,

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.990
Anthony Close...
 

00:23:55.990 --> 00:24:01.914
In a way, Cervantes preempts
all of them by doing what he

00:24:01.914 --> 00:24:05.829
does with Avellaneda's
Quixote,

00:24:05.829 --> 00:24:10.910
but the misreading is
interesting in itself.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.970
If it is a misreading it is
interesting in itself.

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:17.618
If Avellaneda's book stands for
that misreading,

00:24:17.618 --> 00:24:20.210
and I have quotes from two
critics,

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.268
one of whom you have heard
before, that will help clarify

00:24:24.268 --> 00:24:28.690
that potential misreading and
also situate it historically.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:34.647
One is Mariscal,
and I have looked all over to

00:24:34.647 --> 00:24:42.990
discover this fellow's first
name and couldn't find it today.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:47.200
He wrote a book on Avellaneda's
Quixote;

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:54.200
he is a critic who teaches at a
University in California,

00:24:54.200 --> 00:25:01.722
and he underscores the
misreading by pointing out that

00:25:01.722 --> 00:25:08.000
in Avellaneda's book,
Don Quixote is actually chained

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.528
and sent to jail,
not to Yale, to jail.

00:25:12.528 --> 00:25:19.930
I cannot resist telling an
anecdote here,

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:24.200
that is, that my mother,
who was a professor,

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.905
and a very brilliant woman who
did very well in Greek and Latin

00:25:28.905 --> 00:25:32.548
but had little facility for
modern languages,

00:25:32.548 --> 00:25:35.959
including English,
and she would tell her friends

00:25:35.959 --> 00:25:40.601
in Florida to impress them,
"My son Robert is in

00:25:40.601 --> 00:25:46.730
Yale," and when the ladies
did not react as she hoped,

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:49.211
she would say,
"And he has been there a

00:25:49.211 --> 00:25:50.250
long time!"
 

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:55.251
I had to tell her to stop
saying where I was teaching,

00:25:55.251 --> 00:26:00.348
just to say that I was teaching
up north, somewhere.

00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:05.073
So in any case,
in Avellaneda's book,

00:26:05.073 --> 00:26:09.009
Don Quixote is sent to jail.
 

00:26:09.009 --> 00:26:15.487
And Mariscal writes:
"Physical imprisonment in

00:26:15.487 --> 00:26:19.847
the original text [meaning in
the Cervantes's Quixote

00:26:19.847 --> 00:26:22.434
1605]
with the exception of the open

00:26:22.434 --> 00:26:26.869
cage in the final chapters is
displaced by a series of images

00:26:26.869 --> 00:26:30.566
designed to explore the
inescapable yet complex and

00:26:30.566 --> 00:26:34.188
often tenuous inter
relationships between the self

00:26:34.188 --> 00:26:36.848
and the social world:
ropes, strings,

00:26:36.848 --> 00:26:38.180
nets.
 

00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.912
In Avellaneda,
on the other hand,

00:26:40.912 --> 00:26:44.838
the subject must be held
forcibly in place,

00:26:44.838 --> 00:26:48.471
so that it can be the recipient
of both the law's violence and

00:26:48.471 --> 00:26:51.627
the shame produced by the
exchanges with the community

00:26:51.627 --> 00:26:53.488
[the subject,
here, meaning Don

00:26:53.488 --> 00:26:54.230
Quixote]."
 

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.741
He goes on: "The
condemnation of Don Quixote by

00:26:57.741 --> 00:27:01.669
the subordinate classes merely
underscores the ideological

00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:05.105
homogeneity,
to which the Spanish elites,

00:27:05.105 --> 00:27:08.750
with Avellaneda as spokesman,
aspired."

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:12.358
So you can see,
Mariscal is equating

00:27:12.358 --> 00:27:17.926
Avellaneda's imprisoning of the
Quixote with the

00:27:17.926 --> 00:27:23.289
mainstream ideology of the
Spanish of the times.

00:27:23.289 --> 00:27:26.967
He goes on:
"Avellaneda imprisons his

00:27:26.967 --> 00:27:31.940
protagonist because he is mad
[meaning the protagonist,

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.203
not Avellaneda],
yet his more pressing ambition

00:27:35.203 --> 00:27:39.320
is to castigate the alternative
forms of subjectivity which

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.160
Cervantes had explored in his
novel.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.690
The attempt to cultivate an
individualized existence--

00:27:45.690 --> 00:27:49.451
the attempt to cultivate
and individualized

00:27:49.451 --> 00:27:51.286
existence--
runs head on,

00:27:51.286 --> 00:27:54.696
not only into the traditional
constraints of shame and

00:27:54.696 --> 00:27:57.353
revenge,
but finally into the twin

00:27:57.353 --> 00:28:01.270
powers of early Spanish
absolutism with Avellaneda as

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:05.038
their literary spokesman which
work to suppress the

00:28:05.038 --> 00:28:06.470
attempt."
 

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:09.172
So Avellaneda's working to
suppress these forms of

00:28:09.172 --> 00:28:12.150
subjectivity that are present in
the Quixote.

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:14.828
Finally:
"The refusal to align

00:28:14.828 --> 00:28:18.400
himself with any of the
hegemonic forces at work in his

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.838
society underscores a strong
sense of wandering,

00:28:21.838 --> 00:28:25.336
which has been noted by critics
from Lukács to Foucault

00:28:25.336 --> 00:28:27.230
in the original Quixote.
 

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.759
By moving along the margins of
the dominant culture,

00:28:31.759 --> 00:28:35.161
Cervantes' Don Quixote is not
the romantic rebel which much of

00:28:35.161 --> 00:28:37.670
traditional criticism has wanted
him to be.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:41.925
Yet, he nonetheless works to
clear a space upon which modern

00:28:41.925 --> 00:28:45.243
forms of subjectivity would
later appear."

00:28:45.243 --> 00:28:46.108
Unquote.
 

00:28:46.108 --> 00:28:50.828
Mariscal is not aware that the
individual alternative forms of

00:28:50.828 --> 00:28:55.394
subjectivity that he talks about
are bourgeois in origin and

00:28:55.394 --> 00:28:57.371
destiny,
if we're going to see them from

00:28:57.371 --> 00:28:58.500
the Marxist point of view that
he,

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:02.930
I presume, is looking at them
from,

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.459
moreover, he works,
I think, with a utopian vision

00:29:06.459 --> 00:29:10.565
of the liberated self that
Cervantes would have never been

00:29:10.565 --> 00:29:12.868
naïve enough to accept.
 

00:29:12.868 --> 00:29:18.443
But what he says is very
suggestive about the source of

00:29:18.443 --> 00:29:24.534
Avellaneda's concept of the
character that he has taken from

00:29:24.534 --> 00:29:25.980
Cervantes.
 

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.803
Manuel Durán,
who you have encountered many

00:29:29.803 --> 00:29:33.042
times, writes:
"Gilman [Stephen Gilman,

00:29:33.042 --> 00:29:36.869
whom you have also met many
times, professor at Harvard for

00:29:36.869 --> 00:29:40.255
many years,
and he wrote the best works on

00:29:40.255 --> 00:29:42.730
Avellaneda]
has demonstrated the

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:47.284
coincidence between Avellaneda's
attitude and that of post

00:29:47.284 --> 00:29:51.730
Council of Trent morals,
which were aesthetic and

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:57.028
orthodox [You know now what the
Council of Trend because you've

00:29:57.028 --> 00:29:59.250
read it in Elliott,
no?

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:03.653
This is a retrenchment of
Catholic Orthodoxy in the Spain

00:30:03.653 --> 00:30:06.876
of the time.]
Avellaneda would then be the

00:30:06.876 --> 00:30:10.594
representative of all,
of the people's voice,

00:30:10.594 --> 00:30:14.871
but this does not explain why
Avellaneda shows himself to be

00:30:14.871 --> 00:30:18.132
so favorable to the
moriscos [which his

00:30:18.132 --> 00:30:18.930
does].
 

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.580
His Aragenese origin [the
Aragenese were against the

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:23.347
expulsion]
which is probable is not

00:30:23.347 --> 00:30:24.440
sufficient proof.
 

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.352
In any case,
if one accepts that

00:30:26.352 --> 00:30:30.115
Avellaneda's book is a kind of
negative collective response by

00:30:30.115 --> 00:30:33.324
Spain's society of the times to
the freedom and inner

00:30:33.324 --> 00:30:36.286
independence with which
Cervantes had endowed his

00:30:36.286 --> 00:30:39.882
characters,
we will then understand why

00:30:39.882 --> 00:30:44.868
Cervantes did not have immediate
and direct successors,

00:30:44.868 --> 00:30:48.035
and the reason why the modern
novel invented in Spain by

00:30:48.035 --> 00:30:50.971
Cervantes would have to wait
until the middle of the

00:30:50.971 --> 00:30:54.538
nineteenth century to be able to
return to its birthplace.

00:30:54.538 --> 00:30:56.856
Official Spain [goes on
Durán]

00:30:56.856 --> 00:31:00.269
in contrast to the nearly
underground Spain found in a

00:31:00.269 --> 00:31:04.196
path that goes from Rojas and
the mystics to Cervantes did not

00:31:04.196 --> 00:31:08.058
believe in individual
independence and freedoms."

00:31:08.058 --> 00:31:13.390
What Durán means here is
that there is an official Spain,

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:15.404
here, orthodox,
and becoming increasingly

00:31:15.404 --> 00:31:17.269
orthodox in the sixteenth
century,

00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:19.180
but that there is an
underground Spain,

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:23.470
that goes from Rojas,
meaning Fernando de Rojas,

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.710
the author of Celestina,
through the mystics,

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:30.910
Saint John of the Cross,
and so forth,

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:33.990
who were seen with great
suspicion by the Inquisition,

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:41.191
to Cervantes,
and that this is a counter

00:31:41.191 --> 00:31:44.328
official Spain.
 

00:31:44.328 --> 00:31:48.645
But that Avellaneda represents
orthodox Spain,

00:31:48.645 --> 00:31:52.195
here, above this,
which suppresses it,

00:31:52.195 --> 00:31:58.240
and that's why he gives us that
view of the Quixote.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:02.868
I hope this is clear.
 

00:32:02.868 --> 00:32:07.470
Cervantes' relatively mild
response--

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.699
that's where I would like to
put all of the hard school of

00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:12.344
critics,
there with that orthodox Spain

00:32:12.344 --> 00:32:15.278
that represses,
you know?

00:32:15.278 --> 00:32:20.894
Now, Cervantes's relatively
mild response to Avellaneda is

00:32:20.894 --> 00:32:23.259
inline with his irony.
 

00:32:23.259 --> 00:32:28.087
There is a great deal of humor
on what he does to Avellaneda,

00:32:28.087 --> 00:32:32.594
and we'll see it immediately,
when we get to Altisidora's

00:32:32.594 --> 00:32:33.480
vision.
 

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:39.604
An ironist like Cervantes can
never be so sure of himself as

00:32:39.604 --> 00:32:44.380
to be virulent in controversy
and in debate.

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:49.618
How can he be so sure of
himself?

00:32:49.618 --> 00:32:54.107
One of Cervantes' most admired
traits is this restraint and

00:32:54.107 --> 00:32:57.358
self-mockery,
and it shows in his answer to

00:32:57.358 --> 00:32:58.519
Avellaneda.
 

00:32:58.519 --> 00:33:01.118
If you remember,
the 1605 prologue,

00:33:01.118 --> 00:33:04.861
you remember this self mocking
Cervantes who doesn't know what

00:33:04.861 --> 00:33:07.068
to do about writing the
prologue,

00:33:07.068 --> 00:33:09.615
and so forth,
and so on, and all of these

00:33:09.615 --> 00:33:12.988
authorial games by which he
distances himself from his

00:33:12.988 --> 00:33:15.019
creation,
and all of that.

00:33:15.019 --> 00:33:19.054
Someone with that position
could only do to Avellaneda what

00:33:19.054 --> 00:33:20.814
he did,
according to Gilman,

00:33:20.814 --> 00:33:24.060
he sort of threw a "net of
irony" over Avellaneda to

00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:24.858
capture him.
 

00:33:24.858 --> 00:33:29.145
He did say a few nasty things
in the prologue of the 1615

00:33:29.145 --> 00:33:33.351
Quixote but,
of course, Avellaneda had said

00:33:33.351 --> 00:33:38.279
terrible things about Cervantes,
mocked him even because of his

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:40.279
injured hand and everything.
 

00:33:40.279 --> 00:33:45.923
Now, we come to what I think is
the culminating event in

00:33:45.923 --> 00:33:51.874
Barcelona which is Don Quixote's
defeat at the hands of the

00:33:51.874 --> 00:33:54.848
Knight of the White Moon.
 

00:33:54.848 --> 00:33:59.690
The Knight of the White Moon is
the latest reincarnation of

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.689
Sansón Carrasco,
whom we learn has been pursuing

00:34:03.689 --> 00:34:07.288
his neighbor since his failure
as the Knight of the Mirrors.

00:34:07.288 --> 00:34:11.541
He is now in cahoots with the
duke and duchess who tell him

00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:15.103
where Don Quixote has gone,
because Sansón looked

00:34:15.103 --> 00:34:17.539
for him in Saragossa and did not
find him there,

00:34:17.539 --> 00:34:19.260
of course.
 

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.038
The rules are carefully agreed
upon, as with the earlier

00:34:24.038 --> 00:34:28.990
encounter, and Don Quixote is
fairly defeated within those

00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:29.860
rules.
 

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:33.793
He speaks as if dead from
within his armor as he lay on

00:34:33.793 --> 00:34:34.739
the ground.
 

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:39.199
The narrator says:
"Don Quixote,

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.844
bruised and stunned,
without lifting up his visor as

00:34:41.844 --> 00:34:43.969
if he was speaking from within a
tomb,

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:46.550
in a feeble and low voice
said..."

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:47.969
And so forth.
 

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.309
Poor Don Quixote!
 

00:34:49.309 --> 00:34:54.398
If Don Quixote had been killed,
this would have been a possible

00:34:54.398 --> 00:34:58.336
ending but even in defeat,
by his being defeated,

00:34:58.336 --> 00:35:01.619
this could have ended the novel
too.

00:35:01.619 --> 00:35:03.920
Why doesn't it?
 

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.166
Well, it doesn't because he has
not yet given up his persona as

00:35:09.166 --> 00:35:10.518
knight-errant.
 

00:35:10.518 --> 00:35:16.268
Hence the process of his coming
to himself is not yet finished,

00:35:16.268 --> 00:35:20.077
and, as I told you,
that is, his most important

00:35:20.077 --> 00:35:23.565
task,
the task that is comparable to

00:35:23.565 --> 00:35:28.369
the heroic one that Aeneas
accomplishes in Virgil.

00:35:28.369 --> 00:35:32.775
The profound suggestion of Don
Quixote's defeat at the hands of

00:35:32.775 --> 00:35:35.619
the Knight of the White Moon is
that,

00:35:35.619 --> 00:35:38.659
given that this knight is like
the Knight of the Mirrors,

00:35:38.659 --> 00:35:40.719
a reflection of Don Quixote
himself,

00:35:40.719 --> 00:35:46.282
it may be that Don Quixote is
being defeated by a projection

00:35:46.282 --> 00:35:48.639
of his own inner world.
 

00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:53.085
If in Part I,
Don Quixote's body is

00:35:53.085 --> 00:35:59.625
imprisoned in the cage,
here it is as if his spirit

00:35:59.625 --> 00:36:03.809
were the one being defeated.
 

00:36:03.809 --> 00:36:06.961
But it is again,
as if Don Quixote were

00:36:06.961 --> 00:36:11.938
conquered by his own reflection,
by a projection of something

00:36:11.938 --> 00:36:13.929
within his own self.
 

00:36:13.929 --> 00:36:15.960
This is what is profound about
this scene.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.000
It is easy to establish,
of course,

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.076
that the Knight of the White
Moon not only is an image of Don

00:36:21.076 --> 00:36:22.771
Quixote--
remember, that

00:36:22.771 --> 00:36:26.896
"luna"
meant the reflecting part of

00:36:26.896 --> 00:36:29.567
the mirror,
"la luna del

00:36:29.567 --> 00:36:31.751
espejo,"
but also that

00:36:31.751 --> 00:36:34.811
"lunatic"
refers to Don Quixote's

00:36:34.811 --> 00:36:35.760
madness.
 

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:39.043
The moon, of course,
is a celestial body of

00:36:39.043 --> 00:36:42.059
reflected light,
so that Sansón is

00:36:42.059 --> 00:36:44.739
reflecting Don Quixote's light
in a way,

00:36:44.739 --> 00:36:48.960
or the projection of Don
Quixote's spirit.

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:55.827
I am intrigued by the name of
this knight which seems to be

00:36:55.827 --> 00:36:57.250
redundant.
 

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.239
I mean, the moon is always
white, "white moon."

00:37:01.239 --> 00:37:08.260
The doubly white moon seems to
cancel itself out in its

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:14.222
repeated whiteness,
like the--this brings to mind

00:37:14.222 --> 00:37:17.498
the white pearl,
upon the white forehead,

00:37:17.498 --> 00:37:19.860
at the end of Dante's
"Paradiso,"

00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:22.389
white pearl on Beatrice's
forehead loses--

00:37:22.389 --> 00:37:24.500
cannot be seen because it's
white upon white.

00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.789
Don Quixote is fighting,
as it were,

00:37:28.789 --> 00:37:35.480
against his own nothingness,
that light being,

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.295
that I mentioned before,
when alluding to Hamlet and to

00:37:38.295 --> 00:37:40.427
Kundera,
this nothingness,

00:37:40.427 --> 00:37:45.842
which is this white upon white,
that disappears on to itself

00:37:45.842 --> 00:37:49.090
because white can also mean
absence,

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:51.920
and in that sense,
the Knight of the White Moon

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.889
can also be an image of death.
 

00:37:53.889 --> 00:37:58.898
Is there any significance,
the significance to the fact

00:37:58.898 --> 00:38:04.650
that Don Quixote is defeated by
the sea on the shore in an open

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:08.639
space that is nevertheless a
frontier,

00:38:08.639 --> 00:38:11.179
a border between land and water?
 

00:38:11.179 --> 00:38:15.731
Remember what I said at the
very beginning about the sea

00:38:15.731 --> 00:38:19.539
evoking for me,
at least, an image of death.

00:38:19.539 --> 00:38:24.670
It is an image of the infinite,
and of death.

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:28.525
There seems to be a
correspondence to me,

00:38:28.525 --> 00:38:33.730
anyway, between the white of
the knight and the sea.

00:38:33.730 --> 00:38:41.280
So this is, this dramatic
defeat of Don Quixote,

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:47.614
where he has to accept the
conditions set out before a

00:38:47.614 --> 00:38:51.681
fight,
and so they begin to trudge

00:38:51.681 --> 00:38:56.380
back to the village,
and we have this marvelous

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:58.119
pastoral interlude.
 

00:38:58.119 --> 00:39:04.632
Don Quixote imagines a life as
a shepherd, drawn from the

00:39:04.632 --> 00:39:06.960
pastoral romances.
 

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.621
Cervantes, in a way,
is adding to this,

00:39:10.621 --> 00:39:15.150
what I've called smorgasbord of
narrative modes,

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:19.101
the pastoral,
but only as a project by Don

00:39:19.101 --> 00:39:20.449
Quixote.
 

00:39:20.449 --> 00:39:22.873
This would be a novel,
another novel,

00:39:22.873 --> 00:39:26.981
parallel to the Quixote,
in which the pastoral romances

00:39:26.981 --> 00:39:30.079
would play the role of the
chivalric ones.

00:39:30.079 --> 00:39:38.284
Remember, that we have had a
mini Byzantine romance and a

00:39:38.284 --> 00:39:45.023
mini morisca novel,
and if you remember,

00:39:45.023 --> 00:39:51.469
on pages 904,905,
he says, Don Quixote:

00:39:51.469 --> 00:39:55.875
"This is the meadow where
we lighted on the gay

00:39:55.875 --> 00:40:00.798
shepherdesses and gallant
shepherds who intended to revive

00:40:00.798 --> 00:40:02.494
in it,
and imitate,

00:40:02.494 --> 00:40:06.940
the pastoral Arcadia;
a thought as new as ingenious;

00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.679
in imitation of which,
if you approve it,

00:40:09.679 --> 00:40:12.143
I could wish,
O Sancho, we might turn

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:16.389
shepherds, at least for the time
I must have live retired.

00:40:16.389 --> 00:40:18.893
[Meaning, according to what he
has agreed.]

00:40:18.893 --> 00:40:21.275
I will buy sheep,
and all other materials

00:40:21.275 --> 00:40:23.780
necessary for the pastoral
employment;

00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.900
and I, calling myself the
shepherd Quixotiz,

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:32.550
and you the shepherd Panzino,
we will range the mountains,

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.489
the woods and meadows,
singing here,

00:40:34.489 --> 00:40:36.833
and complaining there,
drinking the liquid crystal of

00:40:36.833 --> 00:40:39.025
the fountains,
of the limpid brooks,

00:40:39.025 --> 00:40:40.657
or of the mighty rivers.
 

00:40:40.657 --> 00:40:41.811
The oaks..."
 

00:40:41.811 --> 00:40:42.900
And so forth.
 

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:47.539
This is a description of this
Arcadia, of the pastoral.

00:40:47.539 --> 00:40:51.610
It is a hilarious meta- novel
that he imagines here,

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:55.014
in which the would-be
shepherds, Don Quixote and

00:40:55.014 --> 00:40:57.369
Sancho,
the priest and barber,

00:40:57.369 --> 00:41:00.467
and Sansón,
would take pastoral names,

00:41:00.467 --> 00:41:03.019
as we have seen derived from
their own,

00:41:03.019 --> 00:41:06.250
and give names to their ladies.
 

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:10.403
Remember, Sancho says he's
going to call his wife Teresona,

00:41:10.403 --> 00:41:14.128
with the augmentative,
because apparently she is fat,

00:41:14.128 --> 00:41:15.059
like him.
 

00:41:15.059 --> 00:41:19.489
This is the world of
Garcilaso's eclogues brought to

00:41:19.489 --> 00:41:22.543
Don Quixote's mind,
as he mentions it,

00:41:22.543 --> 00:41:24.829
by the episode of the young
women,

00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:28.239
who are preparing to stage one
of the eclogues,

00:41:28.239 --> 00:41:32.320
which has been anticipated by
all of the references to the

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:35.639
poet in this Part II,
and there will be more.

00:41:35.639 --> 00:41:40.485
It is also a circling back to
Cervantes' first book,

00:41:40.485 --> 00:41:44.858
La Galatea,
remember, of which he always

00:41:44.858 --> 00:41:48.469
said he would write a second
part.

00:41:48.469 --> 00:41:52.851
In this new novel there would
be a world of love without

00:41:52.851 --> 00:41:56.199
violence an ideal Neo-Platonic
universe.

00:41:56.199 --> 00:41:59.208
The same clash appears in
the Quixote between a

00:41:59.208 --> 00:42:02.726
fallen present and an ideal past
that cannot be revived in this

00:42:02.726 --> 00:42:05.927
projected novel,
not to mention that all the

00:42:05.927 --> 00:42:10.170
potential characters are too old
to be pastoral lovers,

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:14.719
and one is a priest,
who can be no lover at all.

00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:20.572
So it is kind of a grotesque
pastoral romance in the making,

00:42:20.572 --> 00:42:24.340
as the Quixote is,
in some ways,

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:28.210
also a grotesque chivalric
romance.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:33.791
This is followed by the episode
where they're run over a herd of

00:42:33.791 --> 00:42:37.199
pigs,
that critics have found that

00:42:37.199 --> 00:42:42.889
Cervantes tinkered around of
where to place this episode,

00:42:42.889 --> 00:42:46.945
but the important thing is that
there seems to be no end to the

00:42:46.945 --> 00:42:51.065
humiliations that Don Quixote is
enduring towards the end of the

00:42:51.065 --> 00:42:54.376
book,
because, remember,

00:42:54.376 --> 00:43:02.639
that there is nothing worse
than a pig or a swineherd,

00:43:02.639 --> 00:43:06.557
which is the word I was looking
for the other day and could not

00:43:06.557 --> 00:43:10.159
find when alluding to the
episode where Sancho has to pass

00:43:10.159 --> 00:43:13.510
judgment on the man who
allegedly raped a woman,

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:16.420
and so forth,
the man was a swineherd.

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:21.219
And so, our heroes are returned
forcibly to the duke and

00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:22.789
duchess's house.
 

00:43:22.789 --> 00:43:26.452
These are not satisfied with
all of the pranks that they have

00:43:26.452 --> 00:43:29.750
made Don Quixote and Sancho
endure and prepare yet,

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:33.101
another, elaborate one for
them, when they hear of the

00:43:33.101 --> 00:43:36.010
knight's defeat and return to
their village.

00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:39.885
Cervantes inserts here a
statement by Cide Hamete to

00:43:39.885 --> 00:43:44.293
underline the questionable state
of mind of these frivolous

00:43:44.293 --> 00:43:45.510
aristocrats.
 

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:50.329
He says, I quote page
nine-one-nine:

00:43:50.329 --> 00:43:53.764
"And Cide Hamete says
besides that to his thinking the

00:43:53.764 --> 00:43:56.960
mockers were as mad as the
mocked and that the duke and

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:00.514
duchess were within two fingers
breath of appearing to be mad

00:44:00.514 --> 00:44:03.507
themselves,
since they took so much pains

00:44:03.507 --> 00:44:06.099
to make a jest of the two
fools."

00:44:06.099 --> 00:44:10.635
So this is world where there
has been a contamination of

00:44:10.635 --> 00:44:13.768
madness from character to
character.

00:44:13.768 --> 00:44:17.338
The skit with the dead
Altisidora is full of literary

00:44:17.338 --> 00:44:18.230
resonances.
 

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:22.210
The staging is elaborate with
bleachers for the audience,

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:26.545
an elevated place for the duke
and duchess, and blazing lights

00:44:26.545 --> 00:44:28.750
to turn the night into day.
 

00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:33.581
Such is the artifice that night
is turned into day with all of

00:44:33.581 --> 00:44:34.768
these lights.
 

00:44:34.768 --> 00:44:40.023
Sancho is costumed in a shroud
of flames and a bonnet with

00:44:40.023 --> 00:44:45.106
devils on it,
which seem Dantesque allusions,

00:44:45.106 --> 00:44:50.034
and the lines recited,
at least, one of the octaves

00:44:50.034 --> 00:44:54.456
recited during the skit are
directly taken from Garcilaso's

00:44:54.456 --> 00:44:55.219
poetry.
 

00:44:55.219 --> 00:45:01.010
The farce is a representation
of the death of the beloved in

00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:06.409
the courtly love tradition and
in Renaissance poetry.

00:45:06.409 --> 00:45:12.253
The famous deaths are of those
Beatrice (Dante),

00:45:12.253 --> 00:45:18.469
Laura, (Petrarch) and Isabel
Freyre (Garcilaso);

00:45:18.469 --> 00:45:20.139
these are three ladies.
 

00:45:20.139 --> 00:45:25.400
There deaths marked the poetry
of these major poets dividing

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:30.929
their works into the before and
then after: before the death of

00:45:30.929 --> 00:45:33.045
Laura,
after the death of Laura,

00:45:33.045 --> 00:45:34.679
before the death of Isabel
Freyre,

00:45:34.679 --> 00:45:37.190
after the death, and so forth.
 

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:42.699
So this is a very significant
moment in the history of western

00:45:42.699 --> 00:45:45.860
poetry that is being staged
here;

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:50.469
this is a representation of
Eros and Thanatos,

00:45:50.469 --> 00:45:53.132
of love and death,
but in a Baroque farce

00:45:53.132 --> 00:45:57.367
involving the protagonists,
and with a whole household,

00:45:57.367 --> 00:46:01.539
it seems,
in attendance.

00:46:01.539 --> 00:46:04.119
This is a prank as elaborate as
the pageant in the forest.

00:46:04.119 --> 00:46:07.356
It is a repetition of it,
as Sancho's fall in the pit was

00:46:07.356 --> 00:46:10.190
a repetition of the cave of
Montesinos episode.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:12.413
Sancho's body,
is again, the object,

00:46:12.413 --> 00:46:15.208
or better, the vehicle for
expiation, and the

00:46:15.208 --> 00:46:18.130
dueñas are his
executioners;

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:22.679
that is, they are going to slap
him around and pinch him,

00:46:22.679 --> 00:46:25.539
and stick pins in his butt,
and so forth,

00:46:25.539 --> 00:46:30.710
and this is what will allow
Altisidora to be revived.

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:33.800
Why? Why again?
 

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:37.900
It seems that Sancho has been
cast in the role of the fool who

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:41.059
must suffer all of the physical
shenanigans,

00:46:41.059 --> 00:46:45.659
meaning the fool drawn from the
carnival tradition.

00:46:45.659 --> 00:46:49.461
This is a reading of his figure
that is parallel to the one

00:46:49.461 --> 00:46:52.347
Avellaneda made,
by turning him to a farcical

00:46:52.347 --> 00:46:55.744
glutton and drunk;
meaning the reading that these

00:46:55.744 --> 00:46:59.460
duke and duchess and their
minions have done of Sancho,

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:01.980
because, remember,
they had read Part I,

00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:04.869
is parallel to the one that
Avellaneda made.

00:47:04.869 --> 00:47:10.349
This is why he is made to
endure these humiliations.

00:47:10.349 --> 00:47:15.945
Don Quixote--the flames in his
dress and the lighting of the

00:47:15.945 --> 00:47:20.119
courtyard seem to be an allusion
to Dido,

00:47:20.119 --> 00:47:23.599
who burned herself to death
when abandoned by Aeneas.

00:47:23.599 --> 00:47:27.554
Don Quixote's return and
impending departure are like

00:47:27.554 --> 00:47:31.585
Aeneas', and Altisidora,
again, is playing the role of

00:47:31.585 --> 00:47:32.268
Dido.
 

00:47:32.268 --> 00:47:36.911
Her anger, and her insults,
which are very colorful and

00:47:36.911 --> 00:47:40.213
actually accurately,
describe Don Quixote,

00:47:40.213 --> 00:47:42.380
who's very ugly,
and he looks like a camel,

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.768
she says, and all of these
things.

00:47:43.768 --> 00:47:48.074
But all of these truths play
into the fiction because it

00:47:48.074 --> 00:47:53.320
sounds like she's saying them in
spite, because he's leaving her;

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.480
so even these truths are
absorbed into the fiction.

00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.775
The whole episode is thick with
literary references and it's

00:48:02.775 --> 00:48:08.431
staging--and it is a staging of
great literature and reducing it

00:48:08.431 --> 00:48:09.510
to play.
 

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:12.414
Now, remember,
those who are doing this,

00:48:12.414 --> 00:48:16.288
are the duchess and the duke,
who are these prankster

00:48:16.288 --> 00:48:17.480
aristocrats.
 

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:22.393
Now, the most remarkable
passage in the whole sequence of

00:48:22.393 --> 00:48:27.219
episodes involving Altisidora is
her infernal vision.

00:48:27.219 --> 00:48:30.000
It's one of my favorite
passages in the whole book.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.775
Sancho, as you remember,
is curious to learn what

00:48:33.775 --> 00:48:38.181
Altisidora saw when she was
dead, what the afterworld was

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:41.800
like, he wants to know,
particularly hell;

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:43.210
he wants to know what hell is
like.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:46.463
Notice, that Altisidora's
infernal voyage is like Don

00:48:46.463 --> 00:48:50.344
Quixote's descent into the cave
of Montesinos and Sancho's fall

00:48:50.344 --> 00:48:51.409
into the pit.
 

00:48:51.409 --> 00:48:55.876
Altisidora's reply,
which she must have made up on

00:48:55.876 --> 00:48:58.898
the spot,
like Dorotea the story of

00:48:58.898 --> 00:49:03.579
Princess Micomicona in Part I,
is a truly brilliant boast of

00:49:03.579 --> 00:49:09.070
imaginative skill on her part,
and of course, on Cervantes's.

00:49:09.070 --> 00:49:14.443
Page 920: "â€˜In
truth,' quoth Altisidora,

00:49:14.443 --> 00:49:19.710
'I did not die quite,
since I went not to hell;

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:24.742
for had I once set foot in it,
I could not have got out again,

00:49:24.742 --> 00:49:27.960
though I had never so great a
desire.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:30.824
[Remember that those who went
to hell, at the entrance of

00:49:30.824 --> 00:49:33.126
hell, in Dante's hell,
it says, lose all hope,

00:49:33.126 --> 00:49:35.018
you cannot ever get out of
here].

00:49:35.018 --> 00:49:36.960
The truth is,
I came to the gate,

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.871
where about a dozen devils were
playing at tennis

00:49:39.871 --> 00:49:42.599
["pelota"
is in Spanish.

00:49:42.599 --> 00:49:45.463
They say "tennis,"
tennis was not invented until

00:49:45.463 --> 00:49:48.364
the eighteenth century,
so Jarvis is indulging in a

00:49:48.364 --> 00:49:51.590
little anachronism here,
but it's close enough],

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:54.090
in their waistcoats and
drawers,

00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:57.320
their shirt-collars ornamented
with Flanders lace,

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.733
and ruffles of the same,
with four inches of the wrists

00:50:00.733 --> 00:50:02.655
bare,
to make their hands seem the

00:50:02.655 --> 00:50:05.768
longer,
in which they held rackets of

00:50:05.768 --> 00:50:06.320
fire.
 

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:10.371
But what I wondered most at
was, that, instead of

00:50:10.371 --> 00:50:13.409
tennis-balls,
they made use of books,

00:50:13.409 --> 00:50:17.039
seemingly stuffed with wind and
flocks;

00:50:17.039 --> 00:50:22.282
a thing marvellous and new:
but this I did not so much

00:50:22.282 --> 00:50:25.333
wonder at,
as to see, that whereas it is

00:50:25.333 --> 00:50:27.949
natural for winning gamesters to
rejoice,

00:50:27.949 --> 00:50:30.907
and losers to be sorry,
among the gamesters of that

00:50:30.907 --> 00:50:32.592
place,
all grumbled,

00:50:32.592 --> 00:50:35.980
all were upon the fret,
and all cursed one another.'

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:39.045
'That is not at all strange,'
answered Sancho:

00:50:39.045 --> 00:50:41.019
'for devils,
play or not play,

00:50:41.019 --> 00:50:44.289
win or not win,
can never become contented.'

00:50:44.289 --> 00:50:47.170
[Sancho is knowledgeable about
what happens in hell,

00:50:47.170 --> 00:50:50.989
of course, he knows the oral
tradition about what is in hell,

00:50:50.989 --> 00:50:53.731
and how...]
'It is true,' quoth Altisidora:

00:50:53.731 --> 00:50:56.670
'but there is another thing I
wondered at,

00:50:56.670 --> 00:51:00.331
I mean, I wondered at it,
then [She has corrected

00:51:00.331 --> 00:51:02.434
herself,
because she's speaking in the

00:51:02.434 --> 00:51:03.722
present,
and she says no,

00:51:03.722 --> 00:51:08.257
no, and she's making it up,
again, remember that Dorotea

00:51:08.257 --> 00:51:12.065
makes a mistake,
also, and has to be corrected

00:51:12.065 --> 00:51:14.469
when she's making it up]
which was,

00:51:14.469 --> 00:51:17.289
that, at the first toss the
ball was demolished,

00:51:17.289 --> 00:51:19.719
and could not serve a second
time;

00:51:19.719 --> 00:51:23.510
and so they whipped them away,
and new and old,

00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:26.570
that it was marvelous to
behold: and to one of them,

00:51:26.570 --> 00:51:28.539
flaming new,
and neatly bound,

00:51:28.539 --> 00:51:32.771
they gave such a smart stroke,
that they made it its guts fly

00:51:32.771 --> 00:51:34.795
out,
and scattered its leaves all

00:51:34.795 --> 00:51:36.898
about,
and one devil said to another:

00:51:36.898 --> 00:51:38.809
"See what that book
is";

00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:42.277
and the other deviled answered:
"It is the Second Part

00:51:42.277 --> 00:51:45.119
of the History of Don Quixote de
la Mancha,

00:51:45.119 --> 00:51:48.960
not composed by Cid Hamet,
its first author,

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.090
but by an Aragonese,
who calls himself a native of

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:53.369
Tordesillas."
 

00:51:53.369 --> 00:51:55.634
[You have that on your cover of
Avellaneda's.]

00:51:55.634 --> 00:51:58.199
"Away with it,"
quoth the other devil,

00:51:58.199 --> 00:52:01.550
"and down with it to the
bottom of the infernal abyss,

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:03.969
that my eyes may never see it
more."

00:52:03.969 --> 00:52:05.059
"Is it so bad?"
 

00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:06.360
answered the other.
 

00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:07.840
"So bad,"
replied the first,

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:12.130
"that, had I myself
undertaken to make it worse,

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:14.139
it had been past my skill."
 

00:52:14.139 --> 00:52:17.601
They went on with their play,
tossing other books and up and

00:52:17.601 --> 00:52:19.429
down...'"
And so forth.

00:52:19.429 --> 00:52:22.518
There is a lot of Dante in this
episode,

00:52:22.518 --> 00:52:26.460
but the story of devil's
playing a form of tennis,

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:29.869
"pelota,"
with the souls or the heads of

00:52:29.869 --> 00:52:32.327
the dead,
is a traditional story,

00:52:32.327 --> 00:52:33.079
gruesome.
 

00:52:33.079 --> 00:52:39.190
But Cervantes has embroidered
upon it, by making them use

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:44.320
books, instead of heads,
or souls, for balls.

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:49.672
The attack on Avellaneda is
very funny, but the commentary

00:52:49.672 --> 00:52:54.650
on books goes beyond the
apocryphal Quixote.

00:52:54.650 --> 00:53:00.663
This episode reflects a change
in the appraisal of books by the

00:53:00.663 --> 00:53:05.610
beginning of the seventeenth
century in the west.

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:09.000
Their value has diminished.
 

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.373
It seems to follow an
elementary economic law:

00:53:12.373 --> 00:53:16.570
with the advent of the printing
press the number of books

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:20.414
increased dramatically,
and then, the value of each

00:53:20.414 --> 00:53:22.567
decreased--
I mean, this is basic

00:53:22.567 --> 00:53:25.780
economics--But it is more
complicated than that.

00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:30.967
Philosophy move toward
knowledge as a result of

00:53:30.967 --> 00:53:37.170
experience, not as something
acquired from authoritative

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:41.570
sources whose works where in
books.

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:45.545
In Spain neo-scholasticism,
about which you have read in

00:53:45.545 --> 00:53:48.161
Elliott,
which was a revival of the

00:53:48.161 --> 00:53:52.159
medieval philosophy of the
church fathers and which relied

00:53:52.159 --> 00:53:56.576
on syllogism and the opinion of
authoritative sources had become

00:53:56.576 --> 00:53:58.750
the ideology of the state.
 

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:01.909
Neo-scholasticism,
doctrine, whatever you want to

00:54:01.909 --> 00:54:05.135
call it, and religious,
it was the ideology of the

00:54:05.135 --> 00:54:06.320
Spanish crown.
 

00:54:06.320 --> 00:54:10.721
Logic argumentation and
authorities supplied the

00:54:10.721 --> 00:54:13.250
foundations of knowledge.
 

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:19.699
We have seen something of that,
and I mention it in the satire

00:54:19.699 --> 00:54:24.010
of doctors,
in the person of doctor Pedro

00:54:24.010 --> 00:54:27.820
Recio Tirteafuera who says to
Sancho,

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:29.875
'you cannot eat this,
you cannot eat that,' the

00:54:29.875 --> 00:54:32.465
knowledge of medicine at the
time was based simply on books

00:54:32.465 --> 00:54:33.449
not on experience.
 

00:54:33.449 --> 00:54:37.800
So the situation in the rest of
Europe was not as extreme,

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.043
by philosophical thought
nonetheless rejected bookish

00:54:41.043 --> 00:54:44.599
learning in favor of experience
and individual thought.

00:54:44.599 --> 00:54:48.619
The greatest exponent of this
was Descartes,

00:54:48.619 --> 00:54:51.795
whom I have mentioned several
times in the course of the

00:54:51.795 --> 00:54:53.443
semester,
and a precursor,

00:54:53.443 --> 00:54:56.007
if you wish,
although in a milder or lighter

00:54:56.007 --> 00:54:59.050
kind of philosophical
speculation was Montaigne.

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:06.159
Anthony Grafton,
professor at Princeton,

00:55:06.159 --> 00:55:14.170
opens the introduction of his
magnificent book,

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:17.608
New Worlds,
Ancient Texts: the Power

00:55:17.608 --> 00:55:22.500
of Tradition and the Shock of
Discovery with these words,

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:27.619
quote: "Between 1550 and
1650 western thinkers ceased to

00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:32.655
believe that they could find all
important truths in ancient

00:55:32.655 --> 00:55:34.789
books." Unquote.
 

00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:38.530
Grafton goes on to quote Jesuit
José de Acosta,

00:55:38.530 --> 00:55:48.500
 
 

00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.425
who published a very important
book, a very comprehensive book

00:55:51.425 --> 00:55:53.250
about the history of the New
World,

00:55:53.250 --> 00:56:03.219
called Historia natural y
moral,

00:56:03.219 --> 00:56:05.929
"moral"
means culture,

00:56:05.929 --> 00:56:09.079
"natural"
is physical,

00:56:09.079 --> 00:56:10.835
the nature and
"moral"

00:56:10.835 --> 00:56:14.190
means culture,
de las Indias.

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:20.601
This book is from the 1590s,
1592, or something like that,

00:56:20.601 --> 00:56:22.739
I can't remember.
 

00:56:22.739 --> 00:56:26.893
But he says,
he quotes Acosta,

00:56:26.893 --> 00:56:31.619
who says the following,
quote:

00:56:31.619 --> 00:56:35.898
"Having read what poets
and philosophers write of the

00:56:35.898 --> 00:56:40.476
torrid zone I persuaded myself
that when I came to the equator

00:56:40.476 --> 00:56:43.704
[he's on a ship on his way to
the New World]

00:56:43.704 --> 00:56:47.833
I would not be able to endure
the heat but it turned out

00:56:47.833 --> 00:56:52.126
otherwise,
for when I passed the equator I

00:56:52.126 --> 00:56:57.304
felt so cold that I was forced
to go into the sun to warm

00:56:57.304 --> 00:56:58.230
myself.
 

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:01.623
What could I do,
but laugh at Aristotle's

00:57:01.623 --> 00:57:03.320
meteorology?"
 

00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.409
Says Acosta.
 

00:57:05.409 --> 00:57:09.385
This is mocked,
by the way, in chapter XIX of

00:57:09.385 --> 00:57:12.297
Part II,
in the episode of the enchanted

00:57:12.297 --> 00:57:14.826
boat,
meaning that the actual

00:57:14.826 --> 00:57:19.929
experience of travel demolishes
traditional knowledge,

00:57:19.929 --> 00:57:23.313
the traditional knowledge being
whether Sancho's lice would die

00:57:23.313 --> 00:57:25.833
when they cross a certain line,
and so forth,

00:57:25.833 --> 00:57:28.730
remember all of that is mocked,
but this is what is behind it.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:31.869
Ironically, then,
the proliferation of books,

00:57:31.869 --> 00:57:36.369
being--at the time,
"when the authority of the

00:57:36.369 --> 00:57:41.949
book was most severely tested
and ultimately devalued."

00:57:41.949 --> 00:57:44.891
That is, the proliferation of
books takes place at the time

00:57:44.891 --> 00:57:47.934
"when the authority of the
book was most severely tested

00:57:47.934 --> 00:57:49.659
and ultimately devalued."
 

00:57:49.659 --> 00:57:56.422
The ability to read many books
did not bring one closer to

00:57:56.422 --> 00:58:02.498
wisdom but to an inordinate,
perhaps infinite enlargement of

00:58:02.498 --> 00:58:06.369
the library and perhaps to Don
Quixote's madness.

00:58:06.369 --> 00:58:11.744
I believe that this is what is
implicit in this marvelous

00:58:11.744 --> 00:58:16.159
passage of Altisidora's infernal
visitation.

00:58:16.159 --> 00:58:20.802
As customary,
Cervantes deals with very

00:58:20.802 --> 00:58:25.853
complicated issues,
in such an unaffected

00:58:25.853 --> 00:58:33.280
spontaneous and amusing way that
it seems almost like a miracle,

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:39.510
but this is what is behind this
episode about books being

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:43.849
whacked with burning flaming
rackets.

00:58:43.849 --> 00:58:49.996
We will be dealing chiefly with
the end of the Quixote in

00:58:49.996 --> 00:58:52.340
the last two lectures.
 

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:58.000

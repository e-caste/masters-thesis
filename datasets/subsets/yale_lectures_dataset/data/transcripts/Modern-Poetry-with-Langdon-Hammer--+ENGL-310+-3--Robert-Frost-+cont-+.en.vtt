00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:06.834
Professor Langdon
Hammer: We talked on Monday

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:13.189
about Frost's idea of "the sound
of sense" and vernacular speech

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:18.838
forms, his wish to put these in
tension or, as he put it,

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:23.680
"strained relation" with
metrical pattern.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.284
The primary metrical pattern in
Frost is the primary metrical

00:00:29.284 --> 00:00:34.514
pattern in English poetry,
which is to say blank verse or

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:37.410
unrhymed iambic pentameter.
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.500
Well, meter: what is meter?
 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.218
Meter is--it's a scheme for
organizing verse,

00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:49.650
for organizing lines of verse.
 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:57.221
It's a scheme that in English
counts accents or stresses per

00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:02.740
line and then arranges them in a
pattern.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.624
Ordinarily, in accentual
syllabic verse,

00:01:07.624 --> 00:01:14.762
which is what we're reading
more often than not in English

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:19.143
poetry,
the accents are arranged in

00:01:19.143 --> 00:01:24.816
relation to unaccented
syllables, creating a kind of

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:28.709
limited array of standard units.
 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:33.910
The most standard of these is
the iamb.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.550
The iamb is a simple pattern of
an unstressed syllable followed

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.370
by a stressed one.
 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.130
A boat,
about,

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.094
a dress,
a coat:

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:52.717
these are all simple iambic
phrases that you hear in our

00:01:52.717 --> 00:01:55.580
language all the time.
 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.326
If you repeat a boat
three times--a boat,

00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:03.578
a boat,
a boat--you have

00:02:03.578 --> 00:02:08.500
trimeter, iambic trimester –
three iambs in a row.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.565
If you do it four times,
you've got tetrameter,

00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:17.199
a more common meter in English.
 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:22.380
And if you repeat them five
times, you have pentameter.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.580
Accent: what is an accent?
 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.919
For some of you,
this will seem self-evident;

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.789
for others, it'll seem like a
great puzzle.

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:41.617
What constitutes an accent when
you--what is an accent in a

00:02:41.617 --> 00:02:44.090
given English word?
 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.442
In fact, linguists often argue
about this subject,

00:02:49.442 --> 00:02:52.610
and it's a complicated one.
 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.793
Accent is something somewhat
difficult to define and

00:02:56.793 --> 00:03:00.599
categorize.
Don't worry about that.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:06.100
Poetry is not interested in
expert debate at all,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.287
and it converts the big
spectrum of possible degrees of

00:03:12.287 --> 00:03:18.246
accent into those two simple
categories: stressed and

00:03:18.246 --> 00:03:21.340
unstressed syllables.
 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.454
So, if you're unsure about the
metrical definition of a line,

00:03:27.454 --> 00:03:32.549
because it's hard to
discriminate between levels of

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.779
stress,
as will almost certainly be the

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:42.998
case, remember that more often
than not, the context takes over

00:03:42.998 --> 00:03:49.017
and the regular beat of a meter
rules and perhaps promotes an

00:03:49.017 --> 00:03:54.935
accent in a phrase that might
not otherwise seem to have one

00:03:54.935 --> 00:03:59.060
to you.
Let's illustrate these general

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.774
points by just reading together
and trying to hear the beginning

00:04:04.774 --> 00:04:08.039
of Robert Frost's poem
"Birches,"

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.560
on page 211 in The
Norton.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.280
 
 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.983
This is an example of blank
verse, and that is always to

00:04:19.983 --> 00:04:24.442
be--blank verse always,
perhaps confusingly,

00:04:24.442 --> 00:04:28.589
to be distinguished from free
verse.

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:31.959
Blank verse is unrhymed iambic
pentameter.

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:36.440
Free verse is non-metrical
poetry, another thing

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.500
altogether.
This is blank verse;

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.810
it's the language of
Shakespeare;

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.730
it's the language of Milton.
 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.779
When I see birches bend
to left and right

00:04:45.779 --> 00:04:48.990
Across the lines of straighter
darker trees,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.560
I like to think some boy's been
swinging them.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.785
Well, for me,
when I try to make sense of the

00:04:57.785 --> 00:05:03.723
meter of given lines,
I think it's useful to try to

00:05:03.723 --> 00:05:07.848
settle,
to start, those syllables that

00:05:07.848 --> 00:05:11.606
seem most clearly stressed,
to, you know,

00:05:11.606 --> 00:05:15.269
identify where there isn't
question;

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:18.704
and use that then as a
structure from which to

00:05:18.704 --> 00:05:21.300
interpret the rest of the lines.
 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.860
So, why don't we do that
together?

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.907
Just looking at this first
line: "When I see birches bend

00:05:28.907 --> 00:05:30.800
to left and right."
 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.110
"When I see birches bend to
left and right."

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.190
"When I see birches bend to
left and right."

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.209
And sometimes it's not good to
repeat it too often;

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.680
then you start to become
unhinged.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.079
Let's see if we can't identify
those syllables that we all are

00:05:50.079 --> 00:05:51.850
going to agree on.
 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.582
Where's the first accent that
you really want to say,

00:05:55.582 --> 00:05:57.090
"that's an accent"?
 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.350
"I."
"Birches."

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.870
"Bend."
"Left."

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.160
"Right."
Debate there?

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.629
 
 

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:23.680
Anybody want to propose another
stress in that line?

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.200
 
 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:34.953
Yes?
There's a stress on "when" and

00:06:34.953 --> 00:06:37.983
"see."
But what if I had the phrase,

00:06:37.983 --> 00:06:41.755
"I see"?
What would be stressed in that

00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:45.710
phrase, "I see"?
"See."

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:50.308
That's true.
"When I see birches bend to

00:06:50.308 --> 00:06:53.810
left and right."
I think I would want to scan

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.410
that line as a bit of an odd
beginning.

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:03.156
I think that word "see"
deserves the accent there,

00:07:03.156 --> 00:07:10.310
and so it's--the first unit of
sound isn't quite normative.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.459
It takes Frost a little sweep
to get going.

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:17.449
"When I see birches bend to
left and right."

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:20.178
But by the time we finish the
end of that line,

00:07:20.178 --> 00:07:23.440
we are really right in the
middle of very regular iambic

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.181
pentameter.
When I see birches bend

00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:30.029
to left and right
Across the lines of straighter

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:33.179
darker trees,
I like to think some boy's been

00:07:33.179 --> 00:07:36.535
swinging them.
"Across the lines of straighter

00:07:36.535 --> 00:07:38.612
darker trees."
Let's do "the lines of

00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:39.880
straighter darker trees."
 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.590
Let's do that line.
 

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:46.220
Accents here?
"Cross."

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.100
"Lines."
"Straight."

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.310
"Trees."
Yes, that one's pretty simple.

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:59.370
Thank you Frost,
you have delivered this to us.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:02.715
And as is not often the case
– excuse me,

00:08:02.715 --> 00:08:07.495
as is not seldom the case in
Frost – there is almost a kind

00:08:07.495 --> 00:08:11.957
of metaphorical play between
what he's describing and the

00:08:11.957 --> 00:08:16.019
sounds with which he is doing
the describing.

00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:22.050
Here, this image of the lines
of trees and the metrical

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:27.300
regularity of that verse that
describes them.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.259
"I like to think some boy's
been swinging them."

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:36.160
"I like to think some boy's
been swinging them."

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:37.740
Yes, what about this line?
 

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:42.820
 
 

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:51.230
"I like to think some boy's
been swinging them."

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:58.120
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Langdon

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:06.477
Hammer: The point is that
"swing" has some interesting

00:09:06.477 --> 00:09:10.895
swinging effect.
Yes, I'm not sure how to

00:09:10.895 --> 00:09:12.320
describe that exactly.
 

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.710
Yes, we want to put a stress on
"swing."

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.610
What other words in that line?
 

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.080
I'm sorry, "think"? Good.
 

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.139
"Like," yes.
"I like" is like "I see."

00:09:27.139 --> 00:09:35.850
"I like to think some boy's,"
"swing," "them."

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.413
Yes, this, too,
is an utterly regular iambic

00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:43.308
pentameter line:
unstressed syllable followed by

00:09:43.308 --> 00:09:46.539
a stressed syllable,
five in a row.

00:09:46.539 --> 00:09:50.170
And, yet, think about the
qualities of sound that are so

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:53.801
different between "across the
lines of straighter darker

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:57.960
trees" and "I like to think some
boy's been swinging them."

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:03.002
What Frost is interested in is
what, really,

00:10:03.002 --> 00:10:09.453
ultimate variety of sounds he
is able to produce as that

00:10:09.453 --> 00:10:16.489
metrical pattern comes into some
kind of tension with English

00:10:16.489 --> 00:10:20.781
sentence sounds,
as he calls them,

00:10:20.781 --> 00:10:25.914
with the effect that each of
Frost's lines of iambic

00:10:25.914 --> 00:10:29.740
pentameter has different
qualities,

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:32.049
even when they're utterly
regular.

00:10:32.049 --> 00:10:35.464
And there are,
in Frost, often some

00:10:35.464 --> 00:10:39.000
variations.
This is something I'd like you

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.239
to practice, I'd like you to
think about, be conscious of,

00:10:43.239 --> 00:10:46.139
and it's something we can
return to.

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:57.252
It's not something I expect you
to necessarily master or become

00:10:57.252 --> 00:11:04.402
advanced in your expertise,
but it is a dimension of the

00:11:04.402 --> 00:11:08.168
poetry that's absolutely
essential to what it is and to

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:11.933
what you're doing when you read
and you hear that voice

00:11:11.933 --> 00:11:15.967
speaking.
And so, I'd like you to work on

00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:18.629
attuning yourselves to it.
 

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:22.799
What can you do with sound as
interpreters?

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:27.981
How do we start to make a
connection between what we hear

00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:30.110
and what things mean?
 

00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:33.524
Well, in Frost's case,
as I'm suggesting,

00:11:33.524 --> 00:11:38.389
there's often very skillful and
complex imitation going on

00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:43.510
between Frost's sounds and what
he's imaging or describing or

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.009
the actions and events in the
poem.

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:53.122
That's the case marvelously in
this poem, and I'd be happy to

00:11:53.122 --> 00:11:59.132
talk about particular examples
with any of you who'd like to

00:11:59.132 --> 00:12:03.740
work through it.
But the point I want to make

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:08.973
about it is much more general
and we don't have to look at

00:12:08.973 --> 00:12:11.820
particular cases to make it.
 

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.859
This is a poem about bending
and breaking,

00:12:16.859 --> 00:12:20.792
or not breaking,
forms – forms,

00:12:20.792 --> 00:12:25.340
the material givens of the
world.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:31.170
It's a poem,
in fact, about strained

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:40.000
relation in a kind of play that
Frost is exploring,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.116
and that strained relation that
the boy achieves as he learns

00:12:45.116 --> 00:12:47.759
how to play with these trees.
 

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:53.705
Well, that's a version of what
we hear in the poem when we hear

00:12:53.705 --> 00:12:59.459
the forms of strained relation
between Frost's dynamic speech

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:04.350
sounds and the metrical pattern
of his writing.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:08.234
The kinetic activity of the
form of the poem,

00:13:08.234 --> 00:13:12.029
in other words,
is something that's like,

00:13:12.029 --> 00:13:17.342
but it's also itself for Frost,
an instance of the relations of

00:13:17.342 --> 00:13:22.008
force and counter-force,
desire and gravity,

00:13:22.008 --> 00:13:25.730
that the poem is describing.
 

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.132
The meter has,
in other words,

00:13:28.132 --> 00:13:32.110
in relation to his individual
sentence sounds,

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:37.853
some of the flexibility and
also resistance that those trees

00:13:37.853 --> 00:13:42.720
have in relation to the boy
using them to swing;

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:49.129
to swing, to go up and down;
to come and go safely.

00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:53.538
These are primal forms of play,
if you like,

00:13:53.538 --> 00:13:57.640
that suggest forms of poetic
activity;

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.500
also, spiritual activity.
 

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:06.673
Frost's ways of using language
in short are like--are versions

00:14:06.673 --> 00:14:10.520
of the boy's way of using the
trees.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:14.050
Let's look at the poem together.
 

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:18.955
I'll read it.
I like to think some

00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:20.740
boy's been swinging them.
 

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.590
But swinging doesn't bend them
down to stay

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.330
As ice-storms do.
 

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.990
[Frost is going to counter-pose
the boy's swinging to

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:40.410
the natural forces imaged in
the ice storm.]

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.886
Often you must have seen them
Loaded with ice a sunny winter

00:14:43.886 --> 00:14:46.290
morning
After a rain.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:49.196
They click upon themselves
As the breeze rises,

00:14:49.196 --> 00:14:53.542
and turn many-colored
As the stir cracks and crazes

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:57.263
their enamel.
Soon the sun's warmth makes

00:14:57.263 --> 00:15:01.519
them shed crystal shells
Shattering and avalanching on

00:15:01.519 --> 00:15:05.339
the snow crust--
Such heaps of broken glass to

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:08.571
sweep away
You'd think the inner dome of

00:15:08.571 --> 00:15:10.019
heaven had fallen.
 

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:15.130
They are dragged to the
withered bracken by the load,

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.039
And they seem not to break;
though once they are bowed

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:24.009
So low for long,
they never right themselves:

00:15:24.009 --> 00:15:27.139
You may see their trunks
arching in the woods

00:15:27.139 --> 00:15:30.145
Years afterwards,
trailing their leaves on the

00:15:30.145 --> 00:15:32.948
ground
Like girls on hands and knees

00:15:32.948 --> 00:15:37.545
that throw their hair
Before them over their heads to

00:15:37.545 --> 00:15:42.044
dry in the sun.
But I was going to say when

00:15:42.044 --> 00:15:45.750
Truth broke in
With all her matter of fact

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.316
about the ice storm,
I should prefer to have some

00:15:50.316 --> 00:15:54.941
boy bend them
As he went out and in to fetch

00:15:54.941 --> 00:15:58.803
the cows--
Some boy too far from town to

00:15:58.803 --> 00:16:02.260
learn baseball,
Whose only play was what he

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:05.516
found himself,
Summer or winter,

00:16:05.516 --> 00:16:08.320
and could play alone.
 

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.240
One by one he subdued his
father's trees

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:15.370
By riding them down over and
over again

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:18.840
Until he took the stiffness out
of them,

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.840
And not one but hung limp,
not one was left

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.090
For him to conquer.
 

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.412
He learned all there was
To learn about not launching

00:16:28.412 --> 00:16:31.726
out too soon
And so not carrying the tree

00:16:31.726 --> 00:16:34.080
away
Clear to the ground.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:38.570
He always kept his poise
To the top branches,

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:43.445
climbing carefully
With the same pains you use to

00:16:43.445 --> 00:16:46.162
fill a cup
Up to the brim,

00:16:46.162 --> 00:16:49.000
and even above the brim.
 

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.509
Then he flung outward,
feet first, with a swish,

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:57.139
Kicking his way down through
the air to the ground.

00:16:57.139 --> 00:17:02.570
So was I once myself a swinger
of birches.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.210
And so I dream of going back to
be.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.390
It's when I'm weary of
considerations

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.589
And life is too much like a
pathless wood

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.230
Where your face burns and
tickles with the cobwebs

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.099
Broken across it,
and one eye is weeping

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.279
From a twig's having lashed
across it open.

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:25.789
I'd like to get away from earth
awhile,

00:17:25.789 --> 00:17:31.490
And then come back to it and
begin over.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.690
May no fate willfully
misunderstand me

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:36.460
And half grant what I wish and
snatch me away

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.238
Not to return.
Earth's the right place for

00:17:41.238 --> 00:17:43.722
love:
I don't know where it's likely

00:17:43.722 --> 00:17:47.371
to go better.
I'd like to go by climbing a

00:17:47.371 --> 00:17:50.491
birch tree,
And climb black branches up a

00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:53.420
snow-white trunk
Toward heaven,

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.319
till the tree could bear no
more,

00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:59.740
But dipped its top and set me
down again.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:04.200
That would be good both going
and coming back.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:08.460
One could do worse than be a
swinger of birches.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:15.272
So, think about the birches as
a tool, another tool,

00:18:15.272 --> 00:18:23.019
but this time a tool for play,
a tool for playing alone.

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:28.370
As in "Mowing," Frost is
writing about solitude,

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.329
an essential loneliness.
 

00:18:31.329 --> 00:18:34.520
The boy's solitude is like the
mower's.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:40.700
Who's absent?
Well, other children.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:46.462
The other character that's
mentioned in the poem is the

00:18:46.462 --> 00:18:50.091
boy's father,
whose trees they are,

00:18:50.091 --> 00:18:54.680
the property owner,
who also is absent.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.942
It's his absence that leaves
the boy alone to his own

00:18:57.942 --> 00:19:00.955
devices.
We might think of him not

00:19:00.955 --> 00:19:06.870
simply as the farmer who holds
the deed to those birches but as

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:11.706
maybe God the Father,
who created them,

00:19:11.706 --> 00:19:17.250
and is likewise absent or
invisible.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:23.217
In the solitude,
the solitude of that absence,

00:19:23.217 --> 00:19:29.980
the boy uses the tree to work
his will playfully.

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:35.140
This time, he's not really a
worker--to work his will on the

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.852
world.
And the boy uses the trees to

00:19:38.852 --> 00:19:41.968
do two things,
right: to go up,

00:19:41.968 --> 00:19:46.019
or go out, and come back,
to return.

00:19:46.019 --> 00:19:50.671
This activity in a wonderful
homely way is a version of

00:19:50.671 --> 00:19:55.940
romance quest.
It's an image of ascent toward

00:19:55.940 --> 00:20:00.609
heaven, from which the boy
returns.

00:20:00.609 --> 00:20:05.193
He's able to rise,
to transcend the limits of his

00:20:05.193 --> 00:20:07.390
own body and station.
 

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:13.349
At the same time it's dangerous.
 

00:20:13.349 --> 00:20:18.046
It's dangerous to want to get
away from earth awhile,

00:20:18.046 --> 00:20:21.930
to get your feet entirely off
the ground.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.720
What might happen to you?
 

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:32.521
Well, to put too much pressure
on any tool is to risk breaking

00:20:32.521 --> 00:20:41.300
it – breaking down maybe,
crashing, coming back to earth

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:46.539
like Icarus, the over-reacher.
 

00:20:46.539 --> 00:20:51.343
The poet, after all,
is subject to gravity in Frost,

00:20:51.343 --> 00:20:53.980
to the force of the earth.
 

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.566
That checks.
It's a counter-weight to

00:20:58.566 --> 00:21:01.259
Frost's romantic longing.
 

00:21:01.259 --> 00:21:05.581
The skill and the play that
Frost is talking about depend on

00:21:05.581 --> 00:21:09.609
being able to use the tool –
in this case the tree,

00:21:09.609 --> 00:21:14.170
emblematic of the world in its
sturdy but also delicate

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:19.321
materiality – to use the tool
to return safely to the ground

00:21:19.321 --> 00:21:22.700
to get your feet back on the
ground.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.279
For "earth's the right place
for love," Frost says.

00:21:26.279 --> 00:21:31.825
It's love that makes the boy
climb, as it made the mower

00:21:31.825 --> 00:21:35.770
work, remember?
But who was talking about love?

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:40.670
It's the--Frost is so sly.
 

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:44.418
He brings it up as if we know
that this is what he's been

00:21:44.418 --> 00:21:46.359
talking about all the time.
 

00:21:46.359 --> 00:21:49.949
Notice, in fact,
the cleverness of all this

00:21:49.949 --> 00:21:52.000
discourse in the poem!
 

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.891
Notice the freedom that he
exercises in unfolding what

00:21:56.891 --> 00:22:02.244
feels like an improvisatory
monologue in which he makes you

00:22:02.244 --> 00:22:07.966
race to keep up with him as he
follows a semi-hidden logic that

00:22:07.966 --> 00:22:10.920
he treats as self-evident.
 

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.950
Notice that final colloquial
phrase, "to go."

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:16.980
He repeats it twice.
 

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.902
"I don't know where it's" –
love – "likely to go better,"

00:22:21.902 --> 00:22:25.839
and then, "I'd like to go by
climbing a tree."

00:22:25.839 --> 00:22:28.769
A wonderful phrase,
"to go," meaning what?

00:22:28.769 --> 00:22:34.591
A variety of things:
"to go" in the sense of to make

00:22:34.591 --> 00:22:38.700
something work out,
to make it go,

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:46.802
to journey, to choose how to
live, to go to the limit,

00:22:46.802 --> 00:22:52.000
where the tool can bear no
more.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.100
Yes.
And people use that phrase,

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.539
too, to mean "to die," don't
they?

00:22:56.539 --> 00:23:01.210
You know, "I'd like to go in
this way";

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:05.680
all those resonances in those
two words.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.921
On Monday I stressed that
poetry was, for Frost,

00:23:10.921 --> 00:23:16.385
always a mode of work,
and that work was for him a

00:23:16.385 --> 00:23:19.619
model of poetic activity.
 

00:23:19.619 --> 00:23:24.127
With "Mowing" as the example,
I said that in Frost,

00:23:24.127 --> 00:23:29.266
meaning is always something
made, something the poet works

00:23:29.266 --> 00:23:31.160
on and works for.
 

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:37.070
Frost's modernity consists in
that: the idea that truth is

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:41.529
something that's concrete and
contingent,

00:23:41.529 --> 00:23:46.557
not a metaphysical matter,
not an ideal principle,

00:23:46.557 --> 00:23:52.508
and that it's something that's
only available in the act of

00:23:52.508 --> 00:23:56.089
deriving it,
constructing it;

00:23:56.089 --> 00:24:00.969
an act that is ordinary,
that's not capable of being

00:24:00.969 --> 00:24:05.466
completed and therefore
necessarily always to be

00:24:05.466 --> 00:24:08.111
repeated;
an ongoing task,

00:24:08.111 --> 00:24:12.230
something you have to get up
and do every day.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:17.818
Frost is a kind of materialist,
by which I mean he calls

00:24:17.818 --> 00:24:22.391
attention to the circumstances
of imagination,

00:24:22.391 --> 00:24:25.440
its limits and conditions.
 

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.339
Poetry is, in Frost,
an encounter between fact and

00:24:30.339 --> 00:24:33.840
desire: what we want and what
is.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.430
 
 

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:42.860
Tools, in Frost,
are an image of the enabling

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.920
and defining conditions of
imagination,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:54.342
and they include in the work of
poetry itself all sorts of

00:24:54.342 --> 00:25:00.990
tools, all the technology of
language and the technology,

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.736
in particular,
of verse, including,

00:25:04.736 --> 00:25:07.049
importantly,
meter.

00:25:07.049 --> 00:25:11.460
The relation between the speech
sounds and the metrical frame of

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.099
a poem, such as "Birches"--it's
like the relation,

00:25:15.099 --> 00:25:18.067
as I'm saying,
between the boy and the

00:25:18.067 --> 00:25:20.447
birches.
In other words,

00:25:20.447 --> 00:25:24.970
meter is something Frost knows
how to use.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:28.995
It's a material force that his
rhetoric challenges and relies

00:25:28.995 --> 00:25:32.349
on, gives him a means of getting
off the ground,

00:25:32.349 --> 00:25:36.619
and a means of always getting
back to it, too.

00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:39.029
And that's another kind of
doubleness in Frost.

00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:42.069
I talked about doubleness last
time.

00:25:42.069 --> 00:25:48.114
Think, in "Birches," of really
the extraordinary play of

00:25:48.114 --> 00:25:52.400
language, the freedom of
association,

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.044
the metaphorical invention –
all of which is being played off

00:25:56.044 --> 00:25:58.220
of the strict demands of the
meter,

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:02.174
at every moment.
It's part of the energy and

00:26:02.174 --> 00:26:04.049
force of the poem.
 

00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:10.536
The work of poetry in Frost,
really the high drama of the

00:26:10.536 --> 00:26:15.967
will at work in the world,
is something that we can

00:26:15.967 --> 00:26:20.707
actually hear in his poetry,
in the expertly explored

00:26:20.707 --> 00:26:24.079
tensions between speech and
meter.

00:26:24.079 --> 00:26:29.333
In that meter,
too, we're hearing some of

00:26:29.333 --> 00:26:31.960
Frost's modernity.
 

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:34.140
Let me say more about what I
mean.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:37.299
 
 

00:26:37.299 --> 00:26:41.935
Let me say more about what I
mean by approaching the question

00:26:41.935 --> 00:26:44.407
of his modernness,
his modernity,

00:26:44.407 --> 00:26:47.730
from the point of view of his
subjects.

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:52.572
Last time I showed you his
second book and its cover,

00:26:52.572 --> 00:26:54.900
North of Boston.
 

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.312
The title of that book,
published in 1914,

00:26:58.312 --> 00:27:02.641
and the one that more than any
other made him famous,

00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:06.720
locates his subjects in a
specific geography.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:11.070
It's important for thinking
about Frost's place in modern

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.678
poetry.
Boston, well,

00:27:12.678 --> 00:27:16.032
it was the capital of
nineteenth-century American

00:27:16.032 --> 00:27:19.901
literature and culture,
a name synonymous,

00:27:19.901 --> 00:27:26.398
eventually, with gentility,
Puritanism, old American money

00:27:26.398 --> 00:27:30.476
and style;
exactly, in other words,

00:27:30.476 --> 00:27:34.369
everything modernism was
attacking.

00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:37.110
So, where do you go to write
modern poetry?

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:40.130
Well, anywhere but Boston.
 

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:47.789
Pound and Eliot importantly go
to London, Paris.

00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:53.507
There's the New York of Crane,
of Moore, of Stevens,

00:27:53.507 --> 00:27:56.150
too.
But Frost says differently.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.670
He alone moves poetry north of
Boston.

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:05.575
To do this is to reverse the
social direction in which

00:28:05.575 --> 00:28:09.894
everyone else is going,
to reverse the direction of

00:28:09.894 --> 00:28:13.753
American modernization,
which is evacuating rural New

00:28:13.753 --> 00:28:17.681
England,
sending its workers to the

00:28:17.681 --> 00:28:22.230
cities in the new industrial
economy.

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:26.308
You can think about Crane's
images of the Brooklyn Bridge in

00:28:26.308 --> 00:28:30.249
this course and then compare
Frost's image of the woodpile

00:28:30.249 --> 00:28:34.674
– that abandoned woodpile that
some worker has left in the poem

00:28:34.674 --> 00:28:36.609
called "The Woodpile."
 

00:28:36.609 --> 00:28:41.723
These are, in a sense,
complementary images of the

00:28:41.723 --> 00:28:43.809
modern in America.
 

00:28:43.809 --> 00:28:48.623
Frost, when he goes north of
Boston, goes back to the

00:28:48.623 --> 00:28:52.417
country, goes in,
in a sense, the opposite

00:28:52.417 --> 00:28:55.750
direction that America is going.
 

00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:00.009
He goes in a sense in an
anti-modern direction,

00:29:00.009 --> 00:29:05.009
maybe even in some sense in a
reactionary direction,

00:29:05.009 --> 00:29:09.293
at least in relation to other
poets' ideas of progress and

00:29:09.293 --> 00:29:13.029
innovation.
This move roots Frost's poetry

00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:18.179
of work in the lives of rural
workers, people who have to

00:29:18.179 --> 00:29:21.490
sustain and entertain
themselves,

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:27.170
often on their own or alone.
 

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.640
What these people have to work
with are the tools that have

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.752
been passed down to them,
or sometimes that they have

00:29:33.752 --> 00:29:38.185
invented.
The poverty of the people Frost

00:29:38.185 --> 00:29:41.369
writes about is important.
 

00:29:41.369 --> 00:29:45.592
It makes them materialists,
too, or realists,

00:29:45.592 --> 00:29:49.343
like Frost.
They are acutely conscious of

00:29:49.343 --> 00:29:53.660
the circumstances in which they
live their lives.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:57.869
And they suffer, they rage.
 

00:29:57.869 --> 00:30:01.066
Their New England,
importantly,

00:30:01.066 --> 00:30:04.690
is not an ideal,
pastoral place.

00:30:04.690 --> 00:30:08.050
The heart of North of
Boston is a series of

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.519
dramatic monologues and
dialogues,

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:14.434
speeches and conversations for
people who really had never

00:30:14.434 --> 00:30:18.279
spoken or never spoken very much
in modern--excuse me,

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:22.203
in American poetry before and
who, in Frost,

00:30:22.203 --> 00:30:26.309
speak in a wholly distinctive
way: that is,

00:30:26.309 --> 00:30:30.877
in Frost's combination of
colloquial sentence sound and

00:30:30.877 --> 00:30:33.329
unrhymed iambic pentameter.
 

00:30:33.329 --> 00:30:36.190
Blank verse:
it is the heroic language of

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.049
Shakespeare, of Milton,
of Wordsworth.

00:30:39.049 --> 00:30:44.434
"The Death of the Hired Man,"
"Home Burial," "A Servant to

00:30:44.434 --> 00:30:49.913
Servants," "The Fear" – these
are poems in which Frost is

00:30:49.913 --> 00:30:55.486
giving New England workers the
language of the great English

00:30:55.486 --> 00:30:59.356
poets.
I've been stressing Frost's

00:30:59.356 --> 00:31:03.163
solitude.
Well, all the people Frost

00:31:03.163 --> 00:31:09.609
writes about are in some sense
alone, often alone together.

00:31:09.609 --> 00:31:13.565
They share solitude,
solitary, too,

00:31:13.565 --> 00:31:17.519
in their relation to each
other.

00:31:17.519 --> 00:31:21.440
Frost as a narrator,
in these great poems I'm

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.628
describing, frames his people's
words minimally,

00:31:25.628 --> 00:31:29.460
with few bits of narrative
information.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:34.026
He just sort of plunges you
into their speech,

00:31:34.026 --> 00:31:37.680
into their lives,
and you have to,

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.835
in a sense, work to get into
their character to be able to

00:31:42.835 --> 00:31:45.730
keep track of who is speaking.
 

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:51.112
Let's look at what is,
for me, the most gripping

00:31:51.112 --> 00:31:57.870
example of this kind of poem:
"Home Burial," on page 204.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:01.890
 
 

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:06.167
Giving us little introduction,
little framing,

00:32:06.167 --> 00:32:09.400
and no consoling closure
really,

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.931
where the moral might come in
another poet,

00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:17.304
Frost creates a kind of
uncomfortable intimacy for us

00:32:17.304 --> 00:32:21.930
with his characters where we're
challenged by them,

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.650
we're brought up close to them.
 

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:26.970
Look at "Home Burial" here.
 

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.430
He saw her from the
bottom of the stairs

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.650
Before she saw him.
 

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:37.920
[And that's a kind of
emblematic moment in Frost

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.970
where one person is,
in a sense, seeing another

00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:44.130
without being seen.]
She was starting down,

00:32:44.130 --> 00:32:48.000
Looking back over her shoulder
at some fear.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.190
She took a doubtful step and
then undid it

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:53.720
To raise herself and look again.
 

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.547
He spoke
Advancing toward her:

00:32:55.547 --> 00:32:58.429
"What is it you see
From up there always?--for I

00:32:58.429 --> 00:32:59.270
want to know."
 

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:02.620
 
 

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.675
[This is another important
Frostian motivation,

00:33:05.675 --> 00:33:10.359
"for I want to know";
here, a desire expressed

00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:13.089
between two people,
a husband and a wife.]

00:33:13.089 --> 00:33:16.523
She turned and sank upon her
skirts at that,

00:33:16.523 --> 00:33:20.523
[as if collapsing]
And her face changed from

00:33:20.523 --> 00:33:22.349
terrified to dull.
 

00:33:22.349 --> 00:33:26.012
He said to gain time:
[And isn't that an interesting

00:33:26.012 --> 00:33:30.509
phrase, "to gain time"?]
"What is it you see?"

00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:36.609
Mounting until she cowered
under him.

00:33:36.609 --> 00:33:42.000
[For he is fearful,
or fearsome.]

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.980
"I will find out now--you must
tell me, dear."

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:51.460
She, in her place,
refused him any help,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:56.559
With the least stiffening of
her neck in silence.

00:33:56.559 --> 00:34:00.270
She let him look,
sure that he wouldn't see,

00:34:00.270 --> 00:34:05.400
Blind creature;
and awhile he didn't see.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:11.400
But at last he murmured,
"Oh," and again,

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:15.310
"Oh."
"What is it--what?"

00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:20.230
she said.
"Just that I see."

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.780
"You don't," she challenged.
 

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.810
"Tell me what it is.
Put it into words.

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:27.929
What does he see?
 

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:34.188
Well, "The wonder is I didn't
see at once" and that is the

00:34:34.188 --> 00:34:38.690
grave that he has made for their
child.

00:34:38.690 --> 00:34:42.110
 
 

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:48.116
In those blocks of speech
there's, importantly--there's

00:34:48.116 --> 00:34:52.900
white space around what they
have to say.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:58.458
It's almost a way of inviting
us to visualize the separation

00:34:58.458 --> 00:35:01.849
of these two people as they
speak.

00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:06.353
And as we read,
we have to fill in the nature

00:35:06.353 --> 00:35:08.809
of their relationship.
 

00:35:08.809 --> 00:35:17.491
Here, well, people are locked
into themselves in Frost and in

00:35:17.491 --> 00:35:20.820
their points of view.
 

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:27.347
Here, the issue in this poem is
grief, how the mother and father

00:35:27.347 --> 00:35:33.460
each express how they deal with
the death of their child.

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:37.215
Simply where and how they stand
in relation to each other as

00:35:37.215 --> 00:35:38.870
they speak is important.
 

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:42.489
 
 

00:35:42.489 --> 00:35:46.787
The woman, the mother,
wishes to--can't help herself

00:35:46.787 --> 00:35:50.409
from trying to hold on to the
dead child,

00:35:50.409 --> 00:35:56.426
and she's caught looking behind
her as if towards the past,

00:35:56.426 --> 00:35:59.019
which is also,
frankly,

00:35:59.019 --> 00:36:04.630
a wish to escape her husband
who is a frightening force,

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:07.690
to escape his will,
I think.

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:12.699
His will, his force – these
are his ways,

00:36:12.699 --> 00:36:17.469
his resources for responding to
death.

00:36:17.469 --> 00:36:22.764
The woman's objection,
as the poem unfolds,

00:36:22.764 --> 00:36:28.688
is summed up by his choice,
the father's choice,

00:36:28.688 --> 00:36:32.469
to bury the child himself.
 

00:36:32.469 --> 00:36:38.810
He responds to this grievous
loss privately by taking it on

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:45.587
himself, by seeking to master it
himself, and specifically as a

00:36:45.587 --> 00:36:50.624
worker.
And the grim tool,

00:36:50.624 --> 00:36:59.358
if you like,
of his mourning is his spade,

00:36:59.358 --> 00:37:07.880
the shovel he uses to do the
burying.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:15.354
On page 206,
she says, well,

00:37:15.354 --> 00:37:23.660
"There you go sneering now!"
 

00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.860
And he says:
"I'm not, I'm not!

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.820
You make me angry.
 

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:28.240
I'll come down to you.
 

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.500
God, what a woman!
 

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.160
And it's come to this,
A man can't speak of his own

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.639
child that's dead."
 

00:37:35.639 --> 00:37:37.386
"You can't [speak]
because you don't know how to

00:37:37.386 --> 00:37:38.130
speak.
[She says.]

00:37:38.130 --> 00:37:39.949
"If you had any feelings,
you that dug

00:37:39.949 --> 00:37:43.809
With your own hand--how could
you?--his little grave;

00:37:43.809 --> 00:37:46.380
I saw you from that very window
there,

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.510
Making the gravel leap and leap
in air,

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:53.670
Leap up, like that,
like that, and land so lightly

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:57.940
And roll back down the mound
beside the hole.

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.590
I thought, Who is that man?
 

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:05.631
I didn't know you.
Well, the father in "Home

00:38:05.631 --> 00:38:10.084
Burial" is a worker,
a worker there in those lines

00:38:10.084 --> 00:38:13.719
reduced to this tool that he's
using,

00:38:13.719 --> 00:38:18.639
almost mechanically,
that makes the dirt leap;

00:38:18.639 --> 00:38:24.802
a kind of desperate mechanism
that's trying to take control of

00:38:24.802 --> 00:38:29.854
the world and failing as he,
well, she says to him,

00:38:29.854 --> 00:38:34.059
and this chills her:
"I can repeat the very

00:38:34.059 --> 00:38:38.287
words you were saying:
'Three foggy mornings and one

00:38:38.287 --> 00:38:42.139
rainy day
Will rot the best birch fence a

00:38:42.139 --> 00:38:44.527
man can build.'
Think of it,

00:38:44.527 --> 00:38:47.400
talk like that at such a
time!"

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.829
But in fact,
in his own way,

00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:54.239
he's talking about his
inability to keep his child

00:38:54.239 --> 00:38:58.841
alive there;
in a kind of metaphorical way,

00:38:58.841 --> 00:39:04.110
speaking of his failure to
build a fence to last.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:09.418
And it drives his wife
ultimately, disgusted by him,

00:39:09.418 --> 00:39:11.500
away, fearing him.
 

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:18.023
Well, "Home Burial" is a poem
about the limits of work,

00:39:18.023 --> 00:39:24.426
the inability of the worker to
bring a knowable world,

00:39:24.426 --> 00:39:27.929
a safe world,
into being.

00:39:27.929 --> 00:39:33.090
There is in Frost no God,
no transcendental source of

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:38.054
guidance or consolation,
nothing out there in the world

00:39:38.054 --> 00:39:42.030
but the material conditions of
our circumstances.

00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:47.343
Over and over again in Frost
poems, you see speakers,

00:39:47.343 --> 00:39:51.840
you see the poet himself,
wanting to know;

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:57.483
and wanting to know means
pressing towards some

00:39:57.483 --> 00:40:04.599
revelation, towards some sense
of the meaning of things,

00:40:04.599 --> 00:40:09.874
a search for some kind of
presence behind the way things

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:12.588
are.
That is the subject of the

00:40:12.588 --> 00:40:14.480
great sonnet "Design."
 

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:20.168
Also, in a very different mood,
the poem "For Once,

00:40:20.168 --> 00:40:22.329
Then, Something."
 

00:40:22.329 --> 00:40:26.650
It's also the subject of
"Neither Out Far nor In Deep,"

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:31.210
which I asked you to read for
today and is on page 220.

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:37.489
 
 

00:40:37.489 --> 00:40:43.239
I won't read it since we're
running a little short of time.

00:40:43.239 --> 00:40:47.744
The people on the shore that
Frost describes there looking

00:40:47.744 --> 00:40:51.300
out to sea--they're watching for
something.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.810
But is there anything to watch
for?

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.980
Is there anything coming?
 

00:40:56.980 --> 00:41:00.300
No, it doesn't appear so.
 

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.699
But as he asks at the end, "...
 

00:41:03.699 --> 00:41:08.780
when was that ever a bar / to
any watch they keep?"

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:15.152
In these poems,
well, when Frost does give us

00:41:15.152 --> 00:41:21.380
images of God or some informing
presence,

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:27.978
that presence is imagined
negatively, to be,

00:41:27.978 --> 00:41:34.269
well, as a kind of malevolence
perhaps,

00:41:34.269 --> 00:41:39.304
to be inferred from the
arbitrariness and cruelness of

00:41:39.304 --> 00:41:44.815
nature's destructive force of
the conditions of life of the

00:41:44.815 --> 00:41:47.760
people Frost is describing.
 

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:56.910
So, if in Frost you can't look
to God for it,

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:04.190
what kind of hope can be
offered?

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.699
How can you save your soul?
 

00:42:06.699 --> 00:42:10.579
This is a question Frost is
interested in.

00:42:10.579 --> 00:42:15.774
In his own ways,
he's interested in redemption

00:42:15.774 --> 00:42:19.929
– an important word for
Stevens.

00:42:19.929 --> 00:42:25.226
To conclude,
let me look quickly with you at

00:42:25.226 --> 00:42:28.059
two great late poems.
 

00:42:28.059 --> 00:42:32.310
One on page 222 is called
"Provide, Provide."

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:36.650
 
 

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:42.648
I'll read this.
The witch that came (the

00:42:42.648 --> 00:42:46.498
withered hag)
To wash the steps with pail and

00:42:46.498 --> 00:42:49.760
rag
Was once the beauty Abishag,

00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.590
The picture pride of Hollywood.
 

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:54.800
Too many fall from great and
good

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.740
For you to doubt the likelihood.
 

00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:01.140
Die early and avoid the fate.
 

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:06.503
Or if predestined to die late,
Make up your mind to die in

00:43:06.503 --> 00:43:09.873
state.
Make the whole stock exchange

00:43:09.873 --> 00:43:14.710
your own!
If need be, occupy a throne,

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.679
Where nobody can call
you crone.

00:43:17.679 --> 00:43:20.180
Some have relied on what they
knew,

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:23.010
Others on being simply true.
 

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:26.180
What worked for them might work
for you.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:31.289
No memory of having starred
Atones for later disregard

00:43:31.289 --> 00:43:33.610
Or keeps the end from being
hard.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:37.748
Better to go down dignified
With boughten friendship at

00:43:37.748 --> 00:43:39.800
your side
Than none at all.

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:46.349
Provide, provide!
And in some recordings Frost

00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:50.719
then says, "...
or somebody'll provide for ya."

00:43:50.719 --> 00:43:54.728
It's a very funny poem,
and you've got triplet rhymes

00:43:54.728 --> 00:43:58.428
there to make sure you know that
Frost is joking,

00:43:58.428 --> 00:44:01.050
and it feels like light verse.
 

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.840
But, of course,
what are we laughing at?

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:08.581
Public achievement,
moral stature – they're of no

00:44:08.581 --> 00:44:11.862
use.
The end is hard and it's going

00:44:11.862 --> 00:44:15.659
to be hard, no matter how you
come to it.

00:44:15.659 --> 00:44:19.110
So, you better look out for
number one.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:23.340
This is good,
old-fashioned American wisdom.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.815
What is scathing about it is
that Frost gives up all

00:44:27.815 --> 00:44:30.800
justification for self-interest.
 

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.329
There's no argument for it
except self-interest itself.

00:44:34.329 --> 00:44:38.360
And then, Frost says,
even that won't work.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:44.220
The choice is a terrifying one
of no friendship and "boughten

00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:49.300
friendship," which really isn't
friendship at all.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.904
In short, the only thing to do
in life is to provide,

00:44:52.904 --> 00:44:56.648
and provide is just what you
cannot ever adequately do,

00:44:56.648 --> 00:44:59.559
as the husband in "Home Burial"
knows.

00:44:59.559 --> 00:45:03.915
This is a poem written in the
depth of the Depression and also

00:45:03.915 --> 00:45:06.199
at the height of Frost's fame.
 

00:45:06.199 --> 00:45:11.818
You could see the kind of grim
refusal to apologize for

00:45:11.818 --> 00:45:18.270
"boughten friendship," as a kind
of, well, as a kind of apology

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:21.599
for his own popular success.
 

00:45:21.599 --> 00:45:26.994
Let me conclude by just
pointing to another poem,

00:45:26.994 --> 00:45:31.601
a late poem,
"Directive," a poem published

00:45:31.601 --> 00:45:35.639
in 1947.
It's on the page following.

00:45:35.639 --> 00:45:42.470
A poem published after the
Second World War,

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:48.030
written about the post-war
world.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:52.639
It begins by,
in a sense, rehearsing or

00:45:52.639 --> 00:46:00.039
taking us back to Frost's own
initial move north of Boston.

00:46:00.039 --> 00:46:02.760
Back out of all this now
too much for us,

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.630
Back in a time made simple by
the loss

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:08.659
Of detail, burned,
dissolved, and broken off

00:46:08.659 --> 00:46:11.789
Like graveyard marble sculpture
in the weather,

00:46:11.789 --> 00:46:15.210
There is a house that is no
more a house...

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:18.969
And that is where he's going to
take us in the poem.

00:46:18.969 --> 00:46:23.850
You can see that house as,
in a sense, a version of the

00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.019
home in "Home Burial."
 

00:46:26.019 --> 00:46:31.267
Frost describes it here,
movingly, as,

00:46:31.267 --> 00:46:39.209
well, an image of a home that
is lost, of a home that has

00:46:39.209 --> 00:46:44.769
failed.
And, yet, Frost's attention is

00:46:44.769 --> 00:46:51.570
drawn, interestingly,
to a playhouse that is part of

00:46:51.570 --> 00:46:56.347
that household.
He says in the middle of the

00:46:56.347 --> 00:46:59.162
poem on page 225:
First there's the

00:46:59.162 --> 00:47:00.940
children's house of
make-believe,

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.719
Some shattered dishes
underneath a pine,

00:47:03.719 --> 00:47:08.420
The playthings in the playhouse
of the children.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:12.570
Weep for what little things
could make them glad.

00:47:12.570 --> 00:47:17.050
Then for the house that is no
more a house...

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:21.865
And so on.
At the end of the poem,

00:47:21.865 --> 00:47:27.999
here, Frost gives us,
however, a kind of alternative

00:47:27.999 --> 00:47:35.455
to this image of the failure of
the home and the failure of the

00:47:35.455 --> 00:47:41.384
worker's life,
in our own imaginative access

00:47:41.384 --> 00:47:47.668
to a spring, a source,
above the house that was the

00:47:47.668 --> 00:47:52.570
water of the house that nurtured
it,

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:56.150
that was its refreshment.
 

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:59.364
He says:
Your destination and your

00:47:59.364 --> 00:48:01.888
destiny's
A brook that was the water of

00:48:01.888 --> 00:48:04.000
the house,
Cold as a spring,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000
as yet so near its source,
Too lofty and original to rage.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.187
...
I have kept hidden in the

00:48:13.187 --> 00:48:17.840
instep arch
Of an old cedar at the waterside

00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:22.780
A broken drinking goblet like
the Grail

00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:26.179
Under a spell so the wrong ones
can't find it,

00:48:26.179 --> 00:48:29.210
So can't get saved as Saint
Mark says they mustn't.

00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:31.590
[And there he sounds like a
child, doesn't he?]

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:35.909
(I stole the goblet from the
children's playhouse.)

00:48:35.909 --> 00:48:39.570
Here are your waters and your
watering place.

00:48:39.570 --> 00:48:45.030
Drink and be whole again beyond
confusion.

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:52.616
There, the goblet,
the tool that Frost comes to is

00:48:52.616 --> 00:48:58.190
a--it's a tool from romance
quest.

00:48:58.190 --> 00:49:04.710
It's the Grail;
it's the cup of the Last Supper.

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:06.659
But what is it?
It's, in fact,

00:49:06.659 --> 00:49:09.880
a broken goblet from the
children's playhouse.

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:16.010
Frost returns us there to the
early sources of imagination in

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:19.378
children's play,
and it gives us,

00:49:19.378 --> 00:49:24.537
at least imaginatively in this
shared journey with him,

00:49:24.537 --> 00:49:28.550
access to a kind of primal
refreshment,

00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:32.619
what he calls our "waters" and
our "watering place."

00:49:32.619 --> 00:49:40.339
It's a disillusioned and
self-consciously ironic promise

00:49:40.339 --> 00:49:44.409
of salvation,
of wholeness.

00:49:44.409 --> 00:49:48.805
But it's still a promise,
and it's a promise of the

00:49:48.805 --> 00:49:53.904
powers of imagination and of
poetry, and of poetry made out

00:49:53.904 --> 00:49:56.630
of play, of a child's play.
 

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:59.130
Well, that's a good place to
stop.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:05.000
Next week we will go to work on
William Butler Yeats.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.729
Prof: We are going to
try to finish with

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:12.097
Inferno today and I would
like to look at the last Cantos

00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:17.960
XXX, XXXI, XXXII maybe a little
bit, XXXIII for sure,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.040
and there are a couple of
details in XXXIV.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:28.609
From one point of view,
I'll be talking about Dante's

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.850
tragic mode at the bottom of
Hell.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.161
This is--I hope to argue with
you that--I will be arguing

00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:43.240
exactly, this is a tragic
representation.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.843
As soon as I say that,
you might wonder,

00:00:47.843 --> 00:00:54.689
you probably should wonder,
about the difficulty of such an

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:56.460
enterprise.
 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.342
And the difficulty of the
enterprise has to do,

00:00:59.342 --> 00:01:01.909
first of all,
with the fact that this is a

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:02.600
comedy.
 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.414
So that difficulty should go
away in the sense that the

00:01:08.414 --> 00:01:12.290
tragic is really part not an
end,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.298
not a final vision,
but part of a larger discourse

00:01:18.298 --> 00:01:23.360
that Dante will go into,
which is a comical idea.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.471
He really has this idea of a
comical vision,

00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:33.019
even of the divinity and
certainly of the cosmos.

00:01:33.019 --> 00:01:37.294
Comical, in the sense that it's
really the feast,

00:01:37.294 --> 00:01:42.458
the feast--in classical times,
it would be the feast of the

00:01:42.458 --> 00:01:43.260
gods.
 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.715
Here is the redemptive,
happy, harmonious sense of the

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:49.540
whole.
 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.140
That's one of the difficulties.
 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.373
The other difficulty
that--about this mode of the

00:01:58.373 --> 00:02:04.700
tragic is that the--
within the Christian vision

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.062
that Dante--
that sort of shapes Dante's

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:14.026
poem, it's very difficult to
locate the tragic:

00:02:14.026 --> 00:02:19.530
there is no such a thing as a
Christian tragedy.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.310
Though one might say,
and I will say here,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.521
just to sort of give you a
sense of how nuanced the issue

00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:30.817
maybe,
is that within that vision,

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:35.080
within that Christian vision,
we are always told that the

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.169
only thing we know of God's
presence in history is the

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:41.610
Crucifixion.
 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.902
There's the story of the dying
god, the story of the suffering

00:02:46.902 --> 00:02:49.680
of the divinity itself.
 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.210
It is not, once again,
a final vision.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.169
So there's a theological
problem that he has to confront

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.275
and there is also an aesthetic
problem, a larger aesthetic

00:03:00.275 --> 00:03:01.139
problem.
 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:04.504
To really clarify these issues,
rather than just telling you

00:03:04.504 --> 00:03:07.984
that all this comes from--I will
look at these cantos from one

00:03:07.984 --> 00:03:08.840
point view.
 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.043
The point of view of Dante's
writing a particular text,

00:03:15.043 --> 00:03:17.800
a text about language.
 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.584
So it's really going to be
about language and tragedy,

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:25.512
in the belief that this is
exactly Dante's insight about

00:03:25.512 --> 00:03:27.438
what the tragic may be.
 

00:03:27.438 --> 00:03:29.655
Let me tell you--I have to go a
little bit outside of the text

00:03:29.655 --> 00:03:31.846
for a while--
so that when I point out

00:03:31.846 --> 00:03:35.756
details here that we'll talk
about in other texts you will

00:03:35.756 --> 00:03:37.060
see what I mean.
 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.074
You know--this is a sort of
also a little bit of a

00:03:41.074 --> 00:03:46.072
recapitulation for you--you know
that Dante goes into exile in

00:03:46.072 --> 00:03:46.810
1302.
 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.628
By that time,
he had written only one book,

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:53.589
an autobiographical book that
had he--the Vita nuova,

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.199
the New Life.
 

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.328
Had he written only that book,
he would still be known as one

00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:02.150
of the great poets of the Middle
Ages,

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.378
but he would not really be
known for more than that.

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:07.348
It's a little bit of a
self-enclosure,

00:04:07.348 --> 00:04:09.588
a lyrical poem,
self-enclosed:

00:04:09.588 --> 00:04:12.019
it's about,
as you recall,

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:16.259
a kind of sense that the self
is absolute,

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:20.230
that love is an absolute itself.
 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.639
It does not allow for the
intrusion of anything within its

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.240
own orbit and its perimeter and
Dante finishes it off with a

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.249
vision,
realizing that he has to do

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:37.019
other things in order to go on
writing.

00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:39.240
He just doesn't write much at
that point.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.550
He may be writing some songs.
 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.694
He is involved in political
life, in the footsteps of his

00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:46.505
teacher,
Brunetto Latini,

00:04:46.505 --> 00:04:50.117
and hoping that his life will
really be very different from

00:04:50.117 --> 00:04:51.300
Brunetto Latini.
 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.899
Ironically, it is not,
because actually it's even more

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:57.480
tragic than Brunetto Latini's
life,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.238
because Brunetto Latini is
politically involved in the

00:05:01.238 --> 00:05:02.800
history of Florence.
 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.725
He will experience exile,
but he will return to Florence

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:11.129
enough to even go on teaching
Dante.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:14.153
He has written encyclopedic
texts, like the

00:05:14.153 --> 00:05:17.069
Trésor;
he has written allegories,

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.199
autobiographical allegories
about his life.

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.214
Dante will go into exile in
1302 and the first thing that he

00:05:23.214 --> 00:05:27.569
writes is a treatise on language
which is called On the Vulgar

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:28.589
Tongue.
 

00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.180
It's a text that--written from
the perspective of exile,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.579
very much like the Divine
Comedy,

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:36.240
because, as I repeat,
Dante will never go back to

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.850
Florence.
 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.649
The reasons why he writes this
kind of text--it's written in

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:46.288
Latin--the reasons are very
unclear, also because he never

00:05:46.288 --> 00:05:47.589
finishes it.
 

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:51.899
I'm going to suggest to you
that there are good reasons why

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:55.690
he could never finish it,
but he wrote two books.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.920
We don't even know how many he
had conceived of writing.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.449
What is this text about?
 

00:06:00.449 --> 00:06:07.040
Let me give you a little bit of
a summary of the text and then

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.740
you will see how it will go on
reappearing in Dante's poem,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.550
the final cantos of
Inferno,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.339
where in effect,
he rewrites,

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.927
he writes and gives a whole--
a sense of the wholeness of

00:06:22.927 --> 00:06:25.069
this text and the difficulties
of--

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:28.315
and he will share with us his
sense of the difficulties why

00:06:28.315 --> 00:06:30.778
that tract could never have been
finished.

00:06:30.778 --> 00:06:34.319
At any rate it starts,
it's called the De vulgari

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.137
eloquentia as it deals with
the origin of the vulgar

00:06:38.137 --> 00:06:38.970
tongues.
 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.480
He starts very much like
medieval treatises start with--

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.480
from a metaphysical standpoint,
from the very high:

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.326
what does human language do,
is language something human and

00:06:52.326 --> 00:06:55.379
the answer that he gives is yes
and no.

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:59.540
It is human because we are the
only ones who do speak,

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.737
though he makes room for
animals, also occasionally

00:07:02.737 --> 00:07:06.192
speaking in a human voice and
being understood by human

00:07:06.192 --> 00:07:08.029
beings,
making sounds that are--and

00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:09.300
he's not talking about parrots.
 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.879
He's talking about miraculous
biblical scenes.

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:14.629
He starts by saying the angels
do not speak.

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:17.100
They don't use the language we
do.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.235
They communicate--Lucifer for
instance, he communicates,

00:07:21.235 --> 00:07:25.146
but he communicates with the
other angels or with God

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:26.350
intuitively.
 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.372
There is a kind of--so there is
a reality that escapes the human

00:07:30.372 --> 00:07:32.367
language,
the language that we use,

00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:34.970
there are some things happening
that we do not have.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.416
Then the language is--it's only
human and yet,

00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:39.920
it's not human because it's
actually a gift.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.079
We couldn't really make it on
our own;

00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:43.550
it's really God's gift.
 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.300
This is the metaphysical
premise.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.740
Who was the first--who are the
first people to speak?

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:51.569
He goes on: Adam and Eve in the
Garden of Eden.

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:55.519
That's biblical enough;
I think it's fairly clear.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:58.065
What was the first language
that they spoke?

00:07:58.065 --> 00:07:58.600
Hebrew.
 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.158
Hebrew is acknowledged as the
primal language and he will even

00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:06.819
go on so far as to say that
Hebrew is never really

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:09.672
extinguished by,
for instance,

00:08:09.672 --> 00:08:14.985
either the fall of man,
of mankind, or by the building

00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:20.300
of the Tower of Babel and the
whole question of Nimrod.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.449
There's a whole story about who
this Nimrod is--

00:08:22.449 --> 00:08:27.550
the famous biblical giant who
built the Tower of Babel,

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:31.988
an act which he even--he,
Dante, but this is very much in

00:08:31.988 --> 00:08:36.190
the tradition of the so-called
patristic writings--

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:41.370
we'll see as the counter to the
descent of the word,

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.759
or the redemptive event of the
word made flesh,

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:49.000
is really the counter to this
human effort;

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.908
this ascent in pride of Nimrod
to try to bridge the gap between

00:08:54.908 --> 00:08:56.720
earth and heaven.
 

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.840
And the effort to that fails.
 

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.322
He will go on acknowledging
Hebrew, but I must say,

00:09:03.322 --> 00:09:07.014
not only he says that it
survives the story of Nimrod,

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:10.080
he says it has never really
disappeared.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.573
He takes, and I'm only
qualifying it,

00:09:13.573 --> 00:09:18.038
what we would call an
ahistorical viewpoint.

00:09:18.038 --> 00:09:22.720
It was almost as if Hebrew is
accepted from--

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.750
it does not belong to the flow
of history and the reality of

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.278
the mutations to which all
things--

00:09:29.278 --> 00:09:33.197
all sublunary things--are prone
and are vulnerable:

00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:35.470
Hebrew is excepted from it.
 

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.620
I stress this fact because I'm
going to come back to this,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.884
maybe toward the end of the
term, when we're going to read

00:09:41.884 --> 00:09:44.691
Paradiso XXVI,
where Dante meets Adam,

00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:47.840
and there blatantly,
he changes his mind.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.259
It is as if something has
intervened in between the

00:09:50.259 --> 00:09:53.163
writing of the De vulgari
eloquentia and the encounter

00:09:53.163 --> 00:09:54.811
with Adam,
when Adam says,

00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:57.700
look, the Hebrew language I
spoke completely,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:03.058
vanished as soon as I ate of
the fruit--

00:10:03.058 --> 00:10:05.379
of the forbidden fruit of the
tree.

00:10:05.379 --> 00:10:08.802
Dante goes on and says there's
no trace of the original

00:10:08.802 --> 00:10:09.500
language.
 

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.206
That is to say,
in Paradise, Dante's

00:10:12.206 --> 00:10:15.750
ready to historicize the
question of human language,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:19.440
but not in this treatise of the
De vulgari eloquentia.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:24.740
He goes on describing the
descent of the word,

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:31.452
so it's a theology of language
and then Book I ends and he

00:10:31.452 --> 00:10:34.279
moves on to Book II.
 

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:37.745
In Book II, Dante gives a
completely different--takes a

00:10:37.745 --> 00:10:40.250
different direction in this
treatise.

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.380
He starts talking,
not about the grammar of

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.495
language,
what we can call the grammar of

00:10:44.495 --> 00:10:46.961
language,
that is to say the ordering,

00:10:46.961 --> 00:10:50.480
how this language was ordered--
that's what I mean by grammar.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.913
Of course it's a word that
explains letters,

00:10:52.913 --> 00:10:55.687
correct uses of things,
but also the ordering of a

00:10:55.687 --> 00:10:56.820
certain reality.
 

00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:01.327
He talks now about rhetoric and
he becomes almost a theorist of

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.710
poetry and style.
 

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.597
He goes on explaining,
for instance,

00:11:05.597 --> 00:11:09.642
he goes on wondering:
what are the three styles of

00:11:09.642 --> 00:11:11.210
writing poetry?
 

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:12.870
And that you know,
because I have been mentioning

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:13.389
some of them.
 

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:16.557
You may recall the high style,
the medium style,

00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:19.120
the middle style,
and the low style;

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.890
the style of comedy,
the style of tragedy and the

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.969
style of the elegy,
the middle style,

00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:25.240
the elegiac style.
 

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.501
He even suggests that style
should never really be thought

00:11:30.501 --> 00:11:33.178
of as a pure ornamentation.
 

00:11:33.178 --> 00:11:36.169
Some of us maybe we do whatever
we think about that:

00:11:36.169 --> 00:11:37.460
so and so has style.
 

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.312
We all remember the phrase that
the style is the man,

00:11:40.312 --> 00:11:42.715
the character;
but sometimes we say,

00:11:42.715 --> 00:11:47.000
well that guy writes with
style, meaning that he has brio.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.899
He has a particular gift in
pulling together words and

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:53.750
writing sentences.
 

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:57.480
Dante sort of implies that
style is really a mode of

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.360
knowledge.
 

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.793
In the measure in which he says
there's a high style for high

00:12:01.793 --> 00:12:04.940
reality and the middle style for
the middle reality--

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.798
the mixed world,
the elegiac world and then a

00:12:07.798 --> 00:12:10.009
low style for the comical world.
 

00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:13.307
He really says that if you
really want to understand those

00:12:13.307 --> 00:12:15.389
who are far below:
the fisherman,

00:12:15.389 --> 00:12:17.937
for instance,
or the clowns,

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:21.240
you cannot really give them
the--

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:26.149
treat them with the decorum
with which you treat the kings.

00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:29.400
Kings speak differently,
the sublime kind of language.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.178
Do you see what I'm saying?
 

00:12:31.178 --> 00:12:34.288
There is an idea that style
becomes an instrument of

00:12:34.288 --> 00:12:35.019
knowledge.
 

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:43.259
He goes on describing the
theory of the song,

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:47.410
which is the greatest poetic
lyrical form and it's the song

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.918
because it's a way of bringing
out the music of the language.

00:12:51.918 --> 00:12:54.592
The music--Dante's
response--this is a little

00:12:54.592 --> 00:12:57.500
historical detail,
it's responding to a poetic

00:12:57.500 --> 00:12:59.980
revolution that had taken place
within--

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.879
in Sicily at the court of
Frederick II.

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:05.551
Because prior to that time,
the Provençal poets

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.846
would be writing,
composing poetry,

00:13:07.846 --> 00:13:11.480
and would accompany their songs
with the lute,

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.308
the famous Provençal
poets' instrument.

00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:17.990
The Sicilians had divided those
two modes.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:21.120
It was possible to write poetry
in and of itself,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.740
without the accompaniment of
music,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.610
in the persuasion that the art
of poetry was the effort to

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:31.799
bring out the inherent harmony
of the language.

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:34.033
He discusses the song;
he discusses themes:

00:13:34.033 --> 00:13:37.291
what are the great themes of
poetry and we alluded to that

00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:40.581
with Bertran de Born,
because Dante says Bertran de

00:13:40.581 --> 00:13:43.470
Born was the greatest in writing
war poetry.

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:46.038
The other themes of course are
rectitude--

00:13:46.038 --> 00:13:49.940
the rectitude of the will,
that is to say,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.913
a sense of the ethical:
what are the ethical directions

00:13:52.913 --> 00:13:54.178
that one should take?
 

00:13:54.178 --> 00:13:56.830
The word direction and
rectitude, they really have the

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.679
same etymology.
 

00:13:57.679 --> 00:14:00.889
Then also love poems.
 

00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:04.129
So this is the way he precedes.
 

00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:07.490
He defines poetry, by the way.
 

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:13.054
He ends with a great definition
of poetry: that poetry is that

00:14:13.054 --> 00:14:18.802
art that combines music--the art
of music--and rhetoric together

00:14:18.802 --> 00:14:20.809
and he ends there.
 

00:14:20.809 --> 00:14:22.288
It's unfinished.
 

00:14:22.288 --> 00:14:25.899
Dante will go on writing other
things,

00:14:25.899 --> 00:14:28.168
for instance,
a philosophical text about

00:14:28.168 --> 00:14:30.130
ethics,
which he also will leave

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.701
unfinished and then will go on
writing the political text De

00:14:33.701 --> 00:14:36.120
Monarchia,
etc., which he finishes.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:42.418
This is the preamble to what we
are going to talk about today.

00:14:42.418 --> 00:14:46.558
I think that the best way to
begin is to tell you,

00:14:46.558 --> 00:14:50.509
since I'll be talking mainly
about tragedy and language,

00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:54.648
I really want to tell you how
much Dante retrieves of the

00:14:54.648 --> 00:14:56.940
De vulgari eloquentia.
 

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:58.870
For instance,
and I'm not going to be--

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:00.850
really giving you a lot of
details,

00:15:00.850 --> 00:15:05.288
but some, so that you can be
persuaded about this--

00:15:05.288 --> 00:15:07.730
that there's really a
deliberate pattern.

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:12.211
This is a deliberate
retrospective view that he takes

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:17.467
of his past, of a failure of his
own, of a certain way of--why

00:15:17.467 --> 00:15:19.019
does one fail?
 

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:23.678
What is so unaccomplishable
about a particular task that--

00:15:23.678 --> 00:15:27.979
I'm using the words that Nimrod
uses for his own Tower of

00:15:27.979 --> 00:15:30.956
Babel--
I realize that it was an

00:15:30.956 --> 00:15:33.149
unaccomplishable task.
 

00:15:33.149 --> 00:15:37.630
And I find myself using those
words for Dante's earlier effort

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.129
in writing on the vulgar tongue.
 

00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:46.035
Some connections between the
treatise and these lower--the

00:15:46.035 --> 00:15:48.419
cantos of lower Hell.
 

00:15:48.419 --> 00:15:50.048
Where are we by the way?
 

00:15:50.048 --> 00:15:52.636
We haven't talked about that,
we got to talk about these are

00:15:52.636 --> 00:15:55.181
the cantos of the lower Hell:
we are in the general area of

00:15:55.181 --> 00:15:55.620
fraud.
 

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.279
You remember that, right?
 

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:58.663
We saw violence.
 

00:15:58.663 --> 00:16:02.383
Now we see fraud,
but if you recall Canto XI

00:16:02.383 --> 00:16:05.373
where the map of--
the ethical map of

00:16:05.373 --> 00:16:09.642
Inferno had been given,
Dante distinguishes between the

00:16:09.642 --> 00:16:12.528
sins of fraud and the sins of
treachery.

00:16:12.528 --> 00:16:18.433
Treachery is a subdivision of
fraud because fraud can be

00:16:18.433 --> 00:16:22.192
rhetoricians,
falsifiers in general,

00:16:22.192 --> 00:16:24.340
flatterers, etc.
 

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.029
These are the--but treachery is
worse than that.

00:16:27.029 --> 00:16:28.600
That's where we are now.
 

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.269
We're in the realm of treachery.
 

00:16:30.269 --> 00:16:35.933
Treachery--the treacherous
sinners are those who engage in

00:16:35.933 --> 00:16:41.500
a deceptive violation of the
trust others place in us.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.720
This is not necessarily true
for all fraudulent people.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:47.375
There's those who can
perpetrate a fraud on you

00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:50.726
without even knowing you or
without even having anything to

00:16:50.726 --> 00:16:51.649
do with you.
 

00:16:51.649 --> 00:16:54.470
The question of treachery is
different.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:17:00.356
It implies a violation of what
Dante calls the erasure of the

00:17:00.356 --> 00:17:04.380
bonds of love,
because it implies friends,

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.028
family, country,
hosts.

00:17:07.028 --> 00:17:10.174
I think, for instance,
Macbeth would belong to this

00:17:10.174 --> 00:17:13.444
type of--the tragedy of
Macbeth--would belong to this

00:17:13.444 --> 00:17:15.269
type of ethical judgment.
 

00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:19.951
The erasure of the bonds of
love and nature:

00:17:19.951 --> 00:17:26.047
it is as if the treacherous
sinners are really those who,

00:17:26.047 --> 00:17:30.183
in betraying,
they really betray nature

00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:31.598
itself.
 

00:17:31.598 --> 00:17:34.865
It is as if something is being
said about that,

00:17:34.865 --> 00:17:38.557
they annihilate all possible
ties within a community,

00:17:38.557 --> 00:17:40.759
within the self and others.
 

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:46.990
Treachery is the language of
nothing.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.611
It's a way of saying that
nothing matters,

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:54.760
there's no bond that I
can--that I could feel an

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.440
attachment too.
 

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:03.605
It's a--literally a severing of
self in the domain of a pure

00:18:03.605 --> 00:18:05.548
arbitrariness.
 

00:18:05.548 --> 00:18:08.328
I mean this:
I am above everything or I'm

00:18:08.328 --> 00:18:10.855
below everything;
it doesn't matter,

00:18:10.855 --> 00:18:14.406
but I certainly have no
attachments to anything around

00:18:14.406 --> 00:18:14.808
me.
 

00:18:14.808 --> 00:18:17.182
That's where we are,
there is so much to say where

00:18:17.182 --> 00:18:19.602
we are in the context,
but the connections with the

00:18:19.602 --> 00:18:21.200
De vulgari eloquentia.
 

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.138
I think that even the story of
Ulysses can be read in the light

00:18:25.138 --> 00:18:28.380
of the De vulgari
eloquentia because it's the

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.160
story of a tragic style.
 

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:33.577
Dante had been describing the
tragic style,

00:18:33.577 --> 00:18:38.380
and the tragic style and the
failure of the tragic style.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:42.422
Even the canto--the successive
canto of Guido de Montefeltro

00:18:42.422 --> 00:18:45.094
can be--it's literally the
counterpoint,

00:18:45.094 --> 00:18:48.038
the rhetorical counterpoint to
Ulysses.

00:18:48.038 --> 00:18:51.400
It's a story of the comical
style.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.380
Certainly Bertran de Born is a
figure who,

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.868
for the first time,
and now the second time,

00:18:56.868 --> 00:18:59.490
appears in the De vulgari
eloquentia,

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.925
and Dante has a great
admiration for Bertran de Born's

00:19:02.925 --> 00:19:03.769
poetic art.
 

00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:08.133
He says the Italians don't have
the language of the poetry of

00:19:08.133 --> 00:19:12.204
war, but the one who has a
poetry of war and modernity is

00:19:12.204 --> 00:19:13.660
Bertran de Born.
 

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.308
Clearly Dante has changed his
opinion here.

00:19:16.308 --> 00:19:21.269
He may admire Bertran de Born,
but the strife,

00:19:21.269 --> 00:19:25.680
the divisiveness that his
poetry fosters,

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:30.200
now sort of has made a victim
of him.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.970
By the way, Pound writes a
great poem about--

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.712
Ezra Pound--about Bertran de
Born, but really keeping in mind

00:19:36.712 --> 00:19:40.458
more that Bertran de Born of the
De vulgari eloquentia

00:19:40.458 --> 00:19:43.894
than the Bertran de Born,
as far as I can tell,

00:19:43.894 --> 00:19:45.308
of Inferno.
 

00:19:45.308 --> 00:19:49.829
We come to Canto XXIX,
which I already looked at

00:19:49.829 --> 00:19:51.595
that--
saw a little bit,

00:19:51.595 --> 00:19:54.289
but I will come to Canto XXX,
for instance,

00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:56.730
and Dante enters deliberately
now,

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:59.147
and on the face of it very
little--There is very little

00:19:59.147 --> 00:20:01.880
here that has to do with the
De vulgari eloquentia,

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.518
but here though,
he's talking about two

00:20:05.518 --> 00:20:09.538
experiences that define the
tragic mode.

00:20:09.538 --> 00:20:12.165
One is, look at this:
"In the time,"

00:20:12.165 --> 00:20:15.714
beginning from Canto XXX,
"In the time when Juno was

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:20.363
enraged because Semele,
the mistress of Jupiter against

00:20:20.363 --> 00:20:25.170
the Theban blood as she showed
once and again,

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:26.940
Athamas so insane."
 

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.038
He's really talking about the
tragic text,

00:20:30.038 --> 00:20:33.840
the Thebaid,
where the gods themselves

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.036
within the world--
the classical world--the gods

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:43.053
themselves seem to have been
wounded by exactly the same mad

00:20:43.053 --> 00:20:47.390
passions that drive human beings
to destruction.

00:20:47.390 --> 00:20:48.779
This is Juno.
 

00:20:48.779 --> 00:20:53.984
Juno doesn't really die but she
will--she suffers the same

00:20:53.984 --> 00:20:54.990
passions.
 

00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:59.679
There's a language here of the
tragic and let's call it the

00:20:59.679 --> 00:21:00.730
mythopoeic.
 

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:04.680
It's a kind of classical
theology being tied to it.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.030
And then the story of the
Trojans once again:

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:12.602
"But no fury of Thebes or
Troy was ever so cruel against

00:21:12.602 --> 00:21:14.048
any," etc.
 

00:21:14.048 --> 00:21:22.154
Then even further on Canto XXX,
line 40, the story of Myrrha,

00:21:22.154 --> 00:21:28.368
the young woman who--it's a
classical story.

00:21:28.368 --> 00:21:32.696
It's an Ovidian story:
the woman who is inflamed by

00:21:32.696 --> 00:21:35.536
passion,
incestuous passion,

00:21:35.536 --> 00:21:41.292
and impersonates somebody else
in order to be able to sleep

00:21:41.292 --> 00:21:43.180
with her father.
 

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:49.998
There is--this is part of all
this tragic, let me call it,

00:21:49.998 --> 00:21:55.500
tragic perimeter,
but everything focuses on the

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:58.848
story of Sinon,
I think.

00:21:58.848 --> 00:22:01.777
I like this idea of Sinon who
is an impersonator and a

00:22:01.777 --> 00:22:02.440
falsifier.
 

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:06.984
You don't really have to know a
lot of Italian to know that

00:22:06.984 --> 00:22:10.432
Dante is really punning on the
name Si / non,

00:22:10.432 --> 00:22:12.548
which means yes and no.
 

00:22:12.548 --> 00:22:18.130
The very representation of the
falsification of personality but

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:20.587
it's the--
so the tragic is tied to some

00:22:20.587 --> 00:22:23.709
sense of identity,
people who do not know

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:27.160
exactly--and that's
impersonation.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:32.164
Human beings who may not know
who they are and who may take on

00:22:32.164 --> 00:22:37.500
some kind of either figuration
or the reality of somebody else.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:42.117
So it's this idea of an
ambiguity already betrayed by

00:22:42.117 --> 00:22:47.269
the name, so the connection
between madness and tragedy.

00:22:47.269 --> 00:22:53.718
Let me move on to Canto XXXI
where Dante enters and now meets

00:22:53.718 --> 00:23:00.596
the giants, clearly a figuration
and an echo of the De vulgari

00:23:00.596 --> 00:23:02.640
eloquentia.
 

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.740
One of them is Nimrod.
 

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:08.140
So this is really a deliberate
reflection.

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:12.749
Let me just read a little bit
of this on line 60 and

00:23:12.749 --> 00:23:17.450
following, where Dante hears
some kinds of sounds.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:23.184
And every commentator of yours,
mine certainly does,

00:23:23.184 --> 00:23:29.369
will tell you that Dante's
using just some gibberish.

00:23:29.369 --> 00:23:31.068
Nobody knows what it means.
 

00:23:31.068 --> 00:23:34.061
These are the words:
"Raphèl may

00:23:34.061 --> 00:23:38.029
amèch zabi almi' began
the savage mouth to cry,

00:23:38.029 --> 00:23:41.269
for which no sweeter psalms
were fit;

00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:46.521
and my Leader towards him:
'Stupid soul keep to thy horn

00:23:46.521 --> 00:23:52.059
and vent thyself with that when
rage or other passion takes

00:23:52.059 --> 00:23:52.920
thee.
 

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.059
Search at thy neck,
bewildered soul,

00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:58.180
and thus shalt find the strap
that holds it tied.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.670
See how it lies across thy
great chest.'

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.980
Then he said to me:
'He is his own accuser.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:09.131
This is Nimrod,
through whose wicked device the

00:24:09.131 --> 00:24:12.200
world is not of one sole speech.
 

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:16.728
Let us leave him there and not
talk in vain,

00:24:16.728 --> 00:24:21.465
for every language is to him as
his to others,

00:24:21.465 --> 00:24:24.308
which is known to none.
 

00:24:24.308 --> 00:24:27.150
We made our way,
therefore, farther on,

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.214
turning left,
and found the next a bowshot

00:24:30.214 --> 00:24:32.682
off, far savager and
larger,"

00:24:32.682 --> 00:24:33.430
etc.
 

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.358
And he meets other--a number of
other giants.

00:24:36.358 --> 00:24:41.098
Why does Dante first of all
mention giants?

00:24:41.098 --> 00:24:43.893
Both the De vulgari
eloquentia and here,

00:24:43.893 --> 00:24:47.720
what is really the point of the
De vulgari eloquentia?

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.294
There is a way in which the
De vulgari eloquentia is

00:24:51.294 --> 00:24:53.759
written from the viewpoint of
Nimrod,

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:59.994
because what Dante wants to do
is something exactly like what

00:24:59.994 --> 00:25:01.970
Nimrod attempted.
 

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.960
Nimrod wanted to combine all
the possible languages,

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.636
that's how Babel,
the confusion of tongues comes

00:25:09.636 --> 00:25:10.420
about.
 

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:14.759
He wanted to combine--to build
a tower whereby human beings can

00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:15.808
reach Heaven.
 

00:25:15.808 --> 00:25:20.560
And I said that it's really the
other side of the incarnational

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:24.009
word: the word that joins Heaven
and Earth.

00:25:24.009 --> 00:25:27.230
One is one of descent,
the other one is the pride of

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.798
ascent.
 

00:25:27.798 --> 00:25:35.973
Nimrod wants--this is the
giantess, this is--his is a sin

00:25:35.973 --> 00:25:38.308
of--not a sin.
 

00:25:38.308 --> 00:25:42.061
It's a trait,
it's a trait of his--of knowing

00:25:42.061 --> 00:25:42.828
things.
 

00:25:42.828 --> 00:25:47.740
He wants to occupy a kind of
superior perspective,

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.548
that's what his being a giant
means.

00:25:51.548 --> 00:25:56.621
A superior perspective from
which he can really see the

00:25:56.621 --> 00:26:02.067
whole of the world around him
and then be able to transcend

00:26:02.067 --> 00:26:06.669
the world of contingency:
this is the problem with

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:07.890
Nimrod.
 

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:11.332
This is what the Tower of Babel
is about and the theological

00:26:11.332 --> 00:26:13.900
answer is that you don't do this
by pride.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:19.141
You really ought to do it by
humility, not by trying to go up

00:26:19.141 --> 00:26:21.500
but really by going down.
 

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.318
What I'm really also saying and
we could talk about this,

00:26:24.318 --> 00:26:27.288
that there is a connection
between pride and perspective.

00:26:27.288 --> 00:26:31.737
The De vulgari
eloquentia is also a text of

00:26:31.737 --> 00:26:33.190
perspectivism.
 

00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:35.829
Do you know what I mean by
perspectivism?

00:26:35.829 --> 00:26:38.098
What we have read so far.
 

00:26:38.098 --> 00:26:41.922
Perspectivism simply means the
presence of viewpoints,

00:26:41.922 --> 00:26:45.310
various viewpoints,
which one somehow manages to

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:47.980
control, or know,
all viewpoints.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:51.070
In Dante, this is the case--the
way the whole of Inferno

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.720
is written.
 

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.684
The perspective on styles:
Dante uses all possible styles

00:26:55.684 --> 00:26:59.862
that I have been exemplifying
for you here as we discuss the

00:26:59.862 --> 00:27:00.500
poem.
 

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.855
He wrote--he uses the courtly
language and the courtly

00:27:03.855 --> 00:27:08.597
rhetoric of Francesca,
the other court--the legal

00:27:08.597 --> 00:27:13.913
court of Pier della Vigna,
the court of the--let's say,

00:27:13.913 --> 00:27:16.454
the schools,
with Brunetto Latini,

00:27:16.454 --> 00:27:18.720
the language of the prophets.
 

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.250
He uses all perspectives.
 

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:24.727
It's the whole of the Divine
Comedy is such a

00:27:24.727 --> 00:27:27.250
perspective, a perspectivist
story.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.952
Some of you might say,
well you really are using a

00:27:29.952 --> 00:27:32.930
language that doesn't belong to
Dante's own culture.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.515
That would be a very legitimate
objection because when we talk

00:27:36.515 --> 00:27:39.244
about perspective,
we usually think about--this is

00:27:39.244 --> 00:27:41.801
really the revolutionary
language of fifteenth-century

00:27:41.801 --> 00:27:42.140
art.
 

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.700
You may--some of you may be art
historians.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.214
You may know that,
though I could respond to you

00:27:48.214 --> 00:27:52.479
that actually there was a
certain knowledge of perspective

00:27:52.479 --> 00:27:54.200
earlier than Dante.
 

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.269
Nonetheless,
even if they did not have a

00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:59.083
theory of perspective,
which I'll explain in a moment,

00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:01.259
they had the practice of
perspective.

00:28:01.259 --> 00:28:05.117
In art--we usually speak of
perspective in art,

00:28:05.117 --> 00:28:08.557
and we usually link it with,
for instance,

00:28:08.557 --> 00:28:10.990
a figure such as Alberti.
 

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:14.713
You know who he is,
this fifteenth-century theorist

00:28:14.713 --> 00:28:16.554
of art,
who wrote a treatise called

00:28:16.554 --> 00:28:20.630
On Painting,
in 1436, where he literally

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:25.749
theorizes that which other
painters from Giotto,

00:28:25.749 --> 00:28:27.710
Dante's friend.
 

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:32.111
Dante's--they were together in
Padua for years when Dante was

00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:36.586
in exile and Giotto was painting
in the Scrovegni Chapel right

00:28:36.586 --> 00:28:37.318
there.
 

00:28:37.318 --> 00:28:39.289
So you could imagine they would
be meeting;

00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:40.288
they knew each other.
 

00:28:40.288 --> 00:28:43.066
They were contemporaries:
one is a year younger than the

00:28:43.066 --> 00:28:43.470
other.
 

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:46.068
Dante's a year older than
Giotto, actually.

00:28:46.068 --> 00:28:48.880
So there was a practice of
perspective.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.950
What is perspective?
 

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:54.784
For Alberti,
it simply means the discovery

00:28:54.784 --> 00:29:01.740
that the mode of representation
practiced in the Middle Ages

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.568
really lacked depth.
 

00:29:04.568 --> 00:29:06.539
Not only that,
lacked depth,

00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:10.845
and that somehow the belief
that the world of appearance and

00:29:10.845 --> 00:29:13.400
the world of reality coincided.
 

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:17.251
Perspective means that the
world that I see shifts,

00:29:17.251 --> 00:29:20.334
changes according to the
position that I,

00:29:20.334 --> 00:29:24.108
the spectator,
occupy in the field of vision.

00:29:24.108 --> 00:29:26.915
I'm here and I can assure you
that I see things that you

00:29:26.915 --> 00:29:29.058
sitting there cannot see and
vice versa.

00:29:29.058 --> 00:29:32.981
You see things that I cannot
see, so the perception of

00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:36.980
reality changes according to the
position we occupy.

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.088
That's perspective.
 

00:29:38.088 --> 00:29:40.976
Not only that,
it also implies the possibility

00:29:40.976 --> 00:29:44.632
of manipulation of the space
that we witness--we see--as a

00:29:44.632 --> 00:29:45.980
particular space.
 

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:51.532
We can change it according to
distance, according to the laws

00:29:51.532 --> 00:29:57.179
of the eyes, the position of the
eye, according to the hour of

00:29:57.179 --> 00:29:58.288
the day.
 

00:29:58.288 --> 00:30:00.200
I see things which are always
different.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:03.753
So this is perspective and
therefore the language of

00:30:03.753 --> 00:30:05.666
Renaissance,
the so-called

00:30:05.666 --> 00:30:08.936
Quattrocento,
the fifteenth-century changes

00:30:08.936 --> 00:30:12.807
the whole medieval idea of
representation where things were

00:30:12.807 --> 00:30:15.410
represented the way they
appeared.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:17.578
They say that's not true.
 

00:30:17.578 --> 00:30:20.589
We are never going to give the
sense of the reality of things,

00:30:20.589 --> 00:30:22.118
but the appearance of things.
 

00:30:22.118 --> 00:30:24.608
So that's really the great--the
difference.

00:30:24.608 --> 00:30:27.519
Dante uses this perspectivism,
which I repeat,

00:30:27.519 --> 00:30:30.688
really means a way of
assembling various points of

00:30:30.688 --> 00:30:31.269
view.
 

00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:35.685
In the persuasion that this is
what really he has:

00:30:35.685 --> 00:30:40.055
he's in exile in 1302;
he has been traveling all over

00:30:40.055 --> 00:30:43.138
Italy;
and he thinks that he can go on

00:30:43.138 --> 00:30:47.034
forging the language,
the vernacular language of

00:30:47.034 --> 00:30:47.779
Italy.
 

00:30:47.779 --> 00:30:50.327
He will go on--let me just go
back to say other things about

00:30:50.327 --> 00:30:52.400
the De vulgari eloquentia
I didn't say.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.151
He will go on writing about the
proximity of the romance

00:30:56.151 --> 00:30:56.970
languages.
 

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.140
He invents this idea of romance
language.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.318
And he says that the way in
which French,

00:31:01.318 --> 00:31:02.900
Provençal,
Spanish,

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:05.623
Italian are connected
together--he says it's one

00:31:05.623 --> 00:31:08.982
particle: the way we use the
'S' When he talks about

00:31:08.982 --> 00:31:13.236
the Provençal,
he says they actually call

00:31:13.236 --> 00:31:19.256
it--they say 'Oc' when
they are to make affirmative

00:31:19.256 --> 00:31:20.630
statement.
 

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:22.603
He goes on talking about this
'S,' the language of the

00:31:22.603 --> 00:31:24.608
'Sì,' the way the
language of what they know.

00:31:24.608 --> 00:31:29.531
This is the way the families of
languages are being built

00:31:29.531 --> 00:31:30.500
together.
 

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:35.413
Nimrod, to go back to the text,
the story of Nimrod and the

00:31:35.413 --> 00:31:39.308
story of Dante seem to be
strangely very close.

00:31:39.308 --> 00:31:40.750
There's more.
 

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:43.621
Look at what he does because
it's so--the link with the De

00:31:43.621 --> 00:31:45.868
vulgari eloquentia is just
extraordinary.

00:31:45.868 --> 00:31:48.614
Even this line,
that everybody thinks doesn't

00:31:48.614 --> 00:31:50.921
mean anything:
"Raphèl may

00:31:50.921 --> 00:31:52.980
amèch zabi almi."
 

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:56.608
If you look at it carefully--I
really want to tell you

00:31:56.608 --> 00:32:01.901
something,
it is an imperfect--there's one

00:32:01.901 --> 00:32:09.000
letter anagram of a Hebrew line
from the Psalms,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.653
and the reference to 'sweeter
Psalms' next will tell you that

00:32:13.653 --> 00:32:16.680
Dante's really giving you the
source.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.152
The line in the Psalm,
Psalm 22, is Eli,

00:32:20.152 --> 00:32:23.548
Eli, lama
sabachthani?

00:32:23.548 --> 00:32:26.692
The fact that there is no exact
correspondence only means that

00:32:26.692 --> 00:32:29.578
the editors have missed the
point: that they should amend

00:32:29.578 --> 00:32:30.250
the text.
 

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:33.848
So it would be an argument for
textual emendation.

00:32:33.848 --> 00:32:36.645
That's something that the
philologists are very careful

00:32:36.645 --> 00:32:39.338
about doing but they always
welcome possibilities.

00:32:39.338 --> 00:32:42.498
This is really--it's an
amazing--so he's using Hebrew

00:32:42.498 --> 00:32:45.595
because that's what he had said
in the De vulgari

00:32:45.595 --> 00:32:48.314
eloquentia,
that Hebrew--this is an

00:32:48.314 --> 00:32:51.976
inverted, twisted language by
the builder of the Tower of

00:32:51.976 --> 00:32:53.851
Babel,
we are not supposed to

00:32:53.851 --> 00:32:56.960
understand it and yet behind all
confusion there is still

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.470
something intelligible,
that's the argument.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:05.421
Behind all twisted appearances
of things there is a residue of

00:33:05.421 --> 00:33:07.921
intellect,
of intelligent,

00:33:07.921 --> 00:33:12.519
intelligible--an intelligible
message that is going to be

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:13.259
given.
 

00:33:13.259 --> 00:33:16.348
What are these words,
by the way?

00:33:16.348 --> 00:33:18.548
Eli, Eli,
lama,

00:33:18.548 --> 00:33:22.320
sabachthani?--I am going
right past it very quickly in

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.730
the belief that you could--
that everybody will know it.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:30.115
These are the words,
Psalm 22, they are the words

00:33:30.115 --> 00:33:35.017
that Jesus on the Cross cites,
"Father,

00:33:35.017 --> 00:33:38.608
Father why have you forsaken
me?"

00:33:38.608 --> 00:33:43.174
It's really the tragic moment
or the moment of the Crucifixion

00:33:43.174 --> 00:33:47.589
where the Son feels that he is
completely abandoned and that

00:33:47.589 --> 00:33:52.666
somehow the whole divine play,
the whole divine order is no

00:33:52.666 --> 00:33:54.950
longer responsive to him.
 

00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:59.038
It's really the moment of the
theological despair,

00:33:59.038 --> 00:34:00.122
they call it.
 

00:34:00.122 --> 00:34:00.788
Okay.
 

00:34:00.788 --> 00:34:05.240
Dante's aware that if
Nimrod--that's what he's--

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.940
Dante, I think is telling
Nimrod obliquely,

00:34:07.940 --> 00:34:11.791
had he not been so stupid he
would have known by using this

00:34:11.791 --> 00:34:14.353
kind of language,
the way in which it would have

00:34:14.353 --> 00:34:15.260
been reaching Heaven.
 

00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:20.268
The way to Heaven is the way to
go down into humility and not up

00:34:20.268 --> 00:34:23.606
through the building of the
Tower of Babel,

00:34:23.606 --> 00:34:26.230
and the confusion of tongues.
 

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.380
Then there is this whole
argument here which I'm not

00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:31.543
going to go into,
but the confusion,

00:34:31.543 --> 00:34:34.139
the perceptual confusion,
perspective.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:38.152
Dante makes his--he is far away
and he mistakes the giants for

00:34:38.152 --> 00:34:40.550
towers,
reference to this famous town

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:44.150
that is still--
if you go on the highway you

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:48.916
can still see Monteriggioni,
that's what Dante went by and

00:34:48.916 --> 00:34:51.519
he thinks that the giants are
towers,

00:34:51.519 --> 00:34:53.900
because you have no perspective.
 

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.757
Because in perspective,
you learn that you see

00:34:56.757 --> 00:35:00.440
according to the distance of
the--where you arrive from the

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.139
object.
 

00:35:01.139 --> 00:35:05.990
This is the basic mathematics,
the geometry that rules and

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:09.139
sustains the theory of
perspective.

00:35:09.139 --> 00:35:16.697
Then it will continue with--let
me just go on to a further case

00:35:16.697 --> 00:35:23.889
of this question of perspective
and I want to read with some

00:35:23.889 --> 00:35:25.840
care XXXIII.
 

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:29.634
Let me turn to Canto XXXII with
more, pursuing this line of

00:35:29.634 --> 00:35:32.840
references to the De vulgari
eloquentia.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.518
Look at this,
"Had I the harsh..."

00:35:34.518 --> 00:35:36.659
It's at the beginning of the
text.

00:35:36.659 --> 00:35:40.579
Would you like to read?
 

00:35:40.579 --> 00:35:46.739
We're reading from Canto XXXII,
line 1 to 12.

00:35:46.739 --> 00:35:48.690
Student:  The version I
have is only Italian.

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:50.579
Prof: I'm impressed.
 

00:35:50.579 --> 00:35:53.809
I didn't mean that--you go
ahead.

00:35:53.809 --> 00:36:01.050
From Canto XXXII,
line 1 to 12 in English.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.742
Student:  "Had I
the harsh and grating rhymes

00:36:03.742 --> 00:36:06.481
that would be fitting for the
dismal hole on which all the

00:36:06.481 --> 00:36:09.032
other rocks bear down,
I would press out more

00:36:09.032 --> 00:36:11.139
completely the sap of my
conception;

00:36:11.139 --> 00:36:16.065
but since I have not,
it is not without fear I bring

00:36:16.065 --> 00:36:19.771
myself to speak,
for to describe the bottom of

00:36:19.771 --> 00:36:23.257
all the universe is no
enterprise to undertake in sport

00:36:23.257 --> 00:36:27.760
or for a tongue that cries,
mamma and babbo.

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:31.530
But may those ladies aid my
verse who aided Amphion to wall

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:35.235
in Thebes, so that the telling
may not be diverse from the

00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:35.820
past.
 

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:40.170
O beyond all others misbegotten
crowd who are in the place it is

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:43.416
hard to speak of,
better had you here been sheep

00:36:43.416 --> 00:36:44.730
or goats!"
 

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.039
Prof: Thank you.
 

00:36:46.039 --> 00:36:51.713
Here, this is the beginning
that in many ways rehashes what

00:36:51.713 --> 00:36:56.018
last time I called the
ineffability topos.

00:36:56.018 --> 00:37:00.554
You remember at the beginning
of Canto XXVIII,

00:37:00.554 --> 00:37:06.297
Dante there is talking about
the sublime, sort of parodic,

00:37:06.297 --> 00:37:10.630
a sort of inverted form of the
sublime.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:15.318
So the horror of what he was
witnessing was such that he

00:37:15.318 --> 00:37:20.179
could not know that he could
find the metaphors for it.

00:37:20.179 --> 00:37:24.940
This is now the deployment of a
variant of that conceit.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:29.070
The conceit here is that
Dante's looking for a style,

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:30.739
he has perspective.
 

00:37:30.739 --> 00:37:34.592
There must be a unique style
for this particular reality and

00:37:34.592 --> 00:37:38.639
he starts, I cannot go on using
the language of familiarity.

00:37:38.639 --> 00:37:40.989
I have to use the babbo
and mamma,

00:37:40.989 --> 00:37:43.719
the language of the child
because this is just--

00:37:43.719 --> 00:37:46.139
they are the treacherous souls
who have betrayed,

00:37:46.139 --> 00:37:49.286
first of all,
family so there is a sort of

00:37:49.286 --> 00:37:53.050
tragic resonance even around
that little motif.

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:56.654
This cannot be done in the
ordinary familiar language of

00:37:56.654 --> 00:38:00.389
everyday because these sinners
have indeed betrayed all of

00:38:00.389 --> 00:38:00.980
that.
 

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.739
Nor can it probably be done at
all,

00:38:04.739 --> 00:38:08.239
because I'm aware,
and how he could not be,

00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:10.280
in this area of treachery and
fraud,

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.469
that words and deeds do not
necessarily belong to him.

00:38:14.469 --> 00:38:15.840
And I'm only paraphrasing the
text.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.445
A search for style,
which he understands as a form

00:38:19.445 --> 00:38:22.313
of what is convenient,
what is decorous,

00:38:22.313 --> 00:38:24.079
what is appropriate.
 

00:38:24.079 --> 00:38:25.590
That's the metaphor he uses.
 

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.394
It's, by the way,
an argument of the De

00:38:27.394 --> 00:38:30.333
vulgari eloquentia,
the principle of convention and

00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:33.166
convenientia:
in Latin the convenience of a

00:38:33.166 --> 00:38:36.521
particular language over another
when one is dealing with a

00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:37.909
particular reality.
 

00:38:37.909 --> 00:38:43.559
The further problem of what
kind of style do I have?

00:38:43.559 --> 00:38:48.639
Is it--can I get in order to
represent this kind of world?

00:38:48.639 --> 00:38:51.909
He appeals to Amphion and the
building of Thebes.

00:38:51.909 --> 00:38:54.842
Once again, this is a tragic
story of Thebes,

00:38:54.842 --> 00:38:57.240
and obliquely,
he's also appealing to

00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:00.039
something that he himself has
written.

00:39:00.039 --> 00:39:04.893
Since Amphion is the poet who
moves stones by the power of his

00:39:04.893 --> 00:39:08.282
language,
a version of Orpheus,

00:39:08.282 --> 00:39:13.342
who placates,
tames the savage beasts within

00:39:13.342 --> 00:39:17.983
the heart within us,
he wants to be a kind of

00:39:17.983 --> 00:39:18.809
Amphion.
 

00:39:18.809 --> 00:39:21.677
The fact is that he has written
stony rhymes,

00:39:21.677 --> 00:39:23.699
he has written--he is moving.
 

00:39:23.699 --> 00:39:26.010
It is a sort of retrospective
view that he takes.

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:31.327
He thinks that the only kind of
style adequate to this reality

00:39:31.327 --> 00:39:36.820
is the style of the crazy poems
representing a crazy time of his

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:42.400
life for this Lady of stone who
would change him into stone.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:47.039
We--an illusion to this
appeared in the canto of the

00:39:47.039 --> 00:39:50.679
Medusa in Canto IX of
Inferno,

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:57.724
so that's really--it begins
with this search for a

00:39:57.724 --> 00:40:06.639
particular style and Dante will
go on through this kind of--

00:40:06.639 --> 00:40:14.090
this whole world of furthering
to the frozen iciness of Hell.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.119
There is no fire, burning fire.
 

00:40:16.119 --> 00:40:19.630
And now that's how the canto
ends.

00:40:19.630 --> 00:40:23.550
And we start with the next
canto: "We already left

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:28.409
him," line 122,
"when I saw two frozen in

00:40:28.409 --> 00:40:32.146
one hole,
so that the one head was a hood

00:40:32.146 --> 00:40:36.279
to the other,
and, as bread is devoured for

00:40:36.279 --> 00:40:41.659
hunger" So you know we're
approaching the most,

00:40:41.659 --> 00:40:45.539
to me, the most unbearable
scene of Inferno,

00:40:45.539 --> 00:40:50.320
the cannibalization:
a human being cannibalizing,

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.989
literally eating, the other.
 

00:40:52.989 --> 00:40:57.235
I know that some of you may
have your sense of--your taste

00:40:57.235 --> 00:40:58.650
can be different.
 

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:02.865
To me, this is really the worst
possible representation,

00:41:02.865 --> 00:41:05.090
tragic representation here.
 

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:08.856
"The one above set his
teeth in the other at the place

00:41:08.856 --> 00:41:13.313
where the brain joins the nape;
Tydeus gnawed the temples of

00:41:13.313 --> 00:41:18.440
Menalippus for rage just as he
was doing with the skull and the

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.679
other parts.
 

00:41:19.679 --> 00:41:26.077
'O thou who by so bestial a
token shows the hatred against

00:41:26.077 --> 00:41:31.342
him thou eatest,
tell me the cause,' I said,

00:41:31.342 --> 00:41:36.003
'on this agreement,
that if thou has reason in thy

00:41:36.003 --> 00:41:40.382
complaint against him I,
knowing who you are and what

00:41:40.382 --> 00:41:45.724
his sin,
shall yet requite thee in the

00:41:45.724 --> 00:41:50.079
world above,
if this tongue I talk with be

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:54.179
not withered.'"
We are approaching a moment

00:41:54.179 --> 00:41:59.849
where literally silence envelops
all possible representations.

00:41:59.849 --> 00:42:02.615
It's something that
nothing--not all can be

00:42:02.615 --> 00:42:04.000
altogether sayable.
 

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.856
It is something that
can--escapes the sayable and

00:42:07.856 --> 00:42:11.632
it's that boundary,
we are at that boundary that

00:42:11.632 --> 00:42:13.239
Dante places us.
 

00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:19.260
This is--you know where this--I
have to read this exchange.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.630
I will read it and then try to
comment on it.

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:25.768
I wish you could have a
discussion about this canto.

00:42:25.768 --> 00:42:29.289
"That sinner,"
actually the Italian really

00:42:29.289 --> 00:42:32.483
begins--
the sentence structure of the

00:42:32.483 --> 00:42:36.030
English wouldn't allow it--
begins with 'the mouth.'

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:40.869
That occupies the primary place
in the line.

00:42:40.869 --> 00:42:43.065
In Italian it's la
bocca,

00:42:43.065 --> 00:42:43.760
the mouth.
 

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:48.989
The object is primary here.
 

00:42:48.989 --> 00:42:52.702
In English: "That sinner
lifted his mouth from the savage

00:42:52.702 --> 00:42:55.239
meal,
wiping it on the hair of the

00:42:55.239 --> 00:43:00.275
head he had wasted behind,
then began: 'Thou wilt have me

00:43:00.275 --> 00:43:06.344
renew desperate grief which even
to think of already wrings my

00:43:06.344 --> 00:43:09.329
heart before I speak of it.
 

00:43:09.329 --> 00:43:14.114
But if my words are to be seed
that may bear the fruit of

00:43:14.114 --> 00:43:18.898
infamy to the traitor I gnaw,
thou shalt see me speak and

00:43:18.898 --> 00:43:23.155
weep together.'"
If we had time and I were to

00:43:23.155 --> 00:43:26.938
ask you whether these lines
remind you of anything in

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:29.635
particular,
I'm sure some of you would

00:43:29.635 --> 00:43:31.489
immediately jump and tell me.
 

00:43:31.489 --> 00:43:37.947
These are clearly an echo of
Inferno V,

00:43:37.947 --> 00:43:41.250
Francesca's language.
 

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:46.840
The language of love has become
now a language of hatred,

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.920
because from the point of view
of Ugolino,

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.389
and that's part of his tragedy,
he can't tell them apart.

00:43:54.389 --> 00:43:59.559
He does not know what love is
and what hatred is,

00:43:59.559 --> 00:44:03.869
and he can exchange one for the
other.

00:44:03.869 --> 00:44:07.420
You could even argue that
retrospectively,

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.172
the language of love of
Francesca maybe was also the

00:44:10.172 --> 00:44:13.331
language of hatred,
but you would be pushing it

00:44:13.331 --> 00:44:15.960
beyond the limits of
believability.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.760
I think that Dante's really
echoing Francesca and the love,

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.983
and the romance with Paolo,
in order to explain this hatred

00:44:25.983 --> 00:44:30.757
and that's the blindness of
Ugolino and I use the word

00:44:30.757 --> 00:44:32.289
deliberately.
 

00:44:32.289 --> 00:44:37.481
What he lacks is any
perspective on himself and on

00:44:37.481 --> 00:44:39.920
the world around him.
 

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:43.170
He then continues,
"Thou art--

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:48.387
I know not who thou art,
nor by what means thou hast

00:44:48.387 --> 00:44:52.672
come down here,
but indeed thou seemest to me

00:44:52.672 --> 00:44:55.619
Florentine when I hear
thee."

00:44:55.619 --> 00:44:57.670
The focus is on language.
 

00:44:57.670 --> 00:45:01.771
Language here,
which is a part of one managing

00:45:01.771 --> 00:45:05.963
to, first of all,
know the other and understand

00:45:05.963 --> 00:45:07.239
the other.
 

00:45:07.239 --> 00:45:10.360
They may know the inflections
of the dialects,

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.838
the Florentine dialect,
and they may even think that

00:45:13.838 --> 00:45:15.606
indeed,
and Dante has a lot to say in

00:45:15.606 --> 00:45:16.920
the De vulgari
eloquentia,

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.853
about the question of the
dialects and the instances that

00:45:20.853 --> 00:45:22.469
they can communicate.
 

00:45:22.469 --> 00:45:26.251
In effect, there's no possible
communication between the two of

00:45:26.251 --> 00:45:26.679
them.
 

00:45:26.679 --> 00:45:31.219
If I were to define for you the
rhetorical genre that Dante

00:45:31.219 --> 00:45:34.429
deploys here,
it is that of what we call a

00:45:34.429 --> 00:45:36.230
dramatic monologue.
 

00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:42.275
Ugolino goes on speaking and
therefore he expects nor does he

00:45:42.275 --> 00:45:46.206
get, any response from his
interlocutor,

00:45:46.206 --> 00:45:49.230
his apparent interlocutor.
 

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:52.603
It's a dramatic monologue when
he goes on telling us the story

00:45:52.603 --> 00:45:54.429
of his life the way he sees it.
 

00:45:54.429 --> 00:45:58.831
You all know nineteenth-century
dramatic monologues in English

00:45:58.831 --> 00:45:59.768
literature.
 

00:45:59.768 --> 00:46:04.139
This is an occurrence of that
genre: I can speak;

00:46:04.139 --> 00:46:05.130
I can tell you.
 

00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:08.922
I can go on fictionalizing
myself and I believe that my

00:46:08.922 --> 00:46:12.784
perspective or the way I
fictionalize myself will become

00:46:12.784 --> 00:46:13.980
your reality.
 

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:18.335
Dante entices of course Ugolino
to do exactly that because this

00:46:18.335 --> 00:46:21.081
is exactly--
this is the way in which you

00:46:21.081 --> 00:46:24.731
are in Hell: where you go on
really believing that whatever

00:46:24.731 --> 00:46:27.768
you tell,
that you can go on telling

00:46:27.768 --> 00:46:32.887
stories and deceive yourself
that others are going to believe

00:46:32.887 --> 00:46:34.849
what you are saying.
 

00:46:34.849 --> 00:46:40.228
The reality that you're going
on constructing is everybody's

00:46:40.228 --> 00:46:41.960
accepted reality.
 

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.050
This is one of the issues,
clearly, that we are going to

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:46.869
confront.
 

00:46:46.869 --> 00:46:52.496
"Thou art to know that I
was Count Ugolino and this is

00:46:52.496 --> 00:46:55.599
the Archbishop Ruggieri."
 

00:46:55.599 --> 00:46:57.260
What an extraordinary line.
 

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.028
What makes this extraordinary
is, first of all,

00:47:01.028 --> 00:47:05.043
the occurrence of what we call
attributes, titles,

00:47:05.043 --> 00:47:08.239
and then the shift in verbal
tense.

00:47:08.239 --> 00:47:15.097
Ugolino will go on attributing
time, "I was Count

00:47:15.097 --> 00:47:18.639
Ugolino and this is...
 

00:47:18.639 --> 00:47:22.059
" That is to say the
object of his hatred is

00:47:22.059 --> 00:47:24.076
unalterable,
is timeless,

00:47:24.076 --> 00:47:28.887
and that object of his hatred
is exactly what goes on defining

00:47:28.887 --> 00:47:29.440
him.
 

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.690
I-- time belongs to me.
 

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:35.639
I know that I belong;
I have a history.

00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:39.965
There is a history behind me
and there is--and this one here,

00:47:39.965 --> 00:47:43.498
the reified the object of my
hatred is unchanging,

00:47:43.498 --> 00:47:45.230
Archbishop Ruggieri.
 

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:48.833
There is the secular and the
sacred, if you wish:

00:47:48.833 --> 00:47:52.811
Guelfs and Ghibellines,
with the idea that Ugolino had

00:47:52.811 --> 00:47:54.989
really betrayed the side.
 

00:47:54.989 --> 00:47:58.842
A Guelf became a Ghibelline and
a Ghibelline became a Guelf and

00:47:58.842 --> 00:47:59.340
so on.
 

00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:03.715
So it's the recapitulation of
all the Inferno satanic

00:48:03.715 --> 00:48:05.719
sins we have seen so far.
 

00:48:05.719 --> 00:48:10.659
"How by means of his evil
devices..."

00:48:10.659 --> 00:48:14.847
"I shall tell thee now why
I am such a neighbor to

00:48:14.847 --> 00:48:18.184
himâ€¦"
What another extraordinary

00:48:18.184 --> 00:48:21.918
line,
because it's the idea of what a

00:48:21.918 --> 00:48:26.690
neighbor is and what the
neighborhood has become.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:32.349
This is the way:
the neighbors cannibalizing,

00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:36.210
one cannibalizing the other.
 

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:40.565
"How by means of his evil
devices, confiding him,

00:48:40.565 --> 00:48:45.170
I was taken and then killed,
there is no need to tell;

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.376
but what thou canst not have
learnt, that is,

00:48:47.376 --> 00:48:50.034
how cruel was my death,
thou shalt hear and shalt know

00:48:50.034 --> 00:48:51.739
if he has done me wrong."
 

00:48:51.739 --> 00:48:56.677
Now he tells the story that he
was put as a prisoner in a

00:48:56.677 --> 00:49:01.878
tower, which we are meant to
understand all the languages of

00:49:01.878 --> 00:49:03.730
the other towers.
 

00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:08.469
A tower which isolates him is a
tower in Pisa.

00:49:08.469 --> 00:49:11.822
By the way it's really the
tower--this has nothing to do

00:49:11.822 --> 00:49:14.166
with,
but I find it irresistible--If

00:49:14.166 --> 00:49:16.829
you read the Cantos of
Ezra Pound,

00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:20.329
some of the most extraordinary
poetry of his,

00:49:20.329 --> 00:49:25.916
I think, comes from when he was
declared a traitor in the

00:49:25.916 --> 00:49:29.510
aftermath of the Second World
War.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.998
He was put in a cage not too
far from this tower of Pisa

00:49:32.998 --> 00:49:36.675
which is really one of the most
beautiful part is where the

00:49:36.675 --> 00:49:39.340
Scuola Normale in
Pisa,

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:44.349
and he writes this poetry about
the tower that he sees.

00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:48.101
Clearly his own sense of trying
to understand what treachery

00:49:48.101 --> 00:49:52.617
really means,
and what I'm really saying is

00:49:52.617 --> 00:50:00.219
these are issues that keep being
present in the consciousness of

00:50:00.219 --> 00:50:05.889
the leading imaginative figures
of our time.

00:50:05.889 --> 00:50:10.762
He goes into this--the tower of
the hunger, as it is called,

00:50:10.762 --> 00:50:12.250
and was shut up.
 

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:12.697
"...
 

00:50:12.697 --> 00:50:15.579
had already shown me through
its slits several moons when I

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:18.960
had the bad dream which rent for
me the veil of the future."

00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.670
He had dreams that--he has a
dream and the mistake he makes

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:27.650
is to think that the dream is
going to be real.

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:31.141
And the dream is this:
"This man appeared to me

00:50:31.141 --> 00:50:34.974
as master and lord hunting the
wolf and the whelps,"

00:50:34.974 --> 00:50:38.576
the word Guelf comes from wolf,
Guelf and Ghibellines,

00:50:38.576 --> 00:50:41.315
"on the mountains for
which the Pisans cannot see

00:50:41.315 --> 00:50:41.780
Lucca.
 

00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:45.262
With hounds lean,
trained and eager he sent them

00:50:45.262 --> 00:50:46.298
the Gualandi..
 

00:50:46.298 --> 00:50:50.521
.that when I awoke"--he
has this idea of destruction,

00:50:50.521 --> 00:50:53.929
the mutual destructions of the
wolf, etc.

00:50:53.929 --> 00:50:56.994
"When I awoke before
morning I heard my children,

00:50:56.994 --> 00:51:00.001
who were with me crying in
their sleep and asking for

00:51:00.001 --> 00:51:00.579
bread.
 

00:51:00.579 --> 00:51:03.815
Thou art cruel indeed if thou
grieve not now,

00:51:03.815 --> 00:51:07.715
thinking what my heart
forboded, and if thou weep not,

00:51:07.715 --> 00:51:10.070
at what does thou ever weep?
 

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:14.449
They were now awake and the
hour approached when our food

00:51:14.449 --> 00:51:18.503
used to be brought to us,
and each was afraid because of

00:51:18.503 --> 00:51:22.041
his dream and I heard below the
door of the horrible tower

00:51:22.041 --> 00:51:24.664
nailed up;
at which I looked in the faces

00:51:24.664 --> 00:51:26.300
of my sons without a word.
 

00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:30.599
I did not weep,
I so turned to stone within.

00:51:30.599 --> 00:51:33.811
They wept, and my little Anselm
saidâ€¦"

00:51:33.811 --> 00:51:37.344
By the way,
to understand how there is a

00:51:37.344 --> 00:51:42.668
counter: there is a sort of
movement between the horror of

00:51:42.668 --> 00:51:47.840
this tragedy and the tenderness,
the pathos of it.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.228
One of the ways in which Dante
suggests this,

00:51:51.228 --> 00:51:54.925
is the use of diminutives for
Anselmuccio,

00:51:54.925 --> 00:51:58.159
this little kid that he has,
this kid.

00:51:58.159 --> 00:52:01.099
"Thou lookest so,
father, what ails thee?'

00:52:01.099 --> 00:52:03.659
At that I shed no tears,
nor answered all that day,

00:52:03.659 --> 00:52:06.271
nor that night after,
till another sun came forth on

00:52:06.271 --> 00:52:06.989
the world.
 

00:52:06.989 --> 00:52:11.168
As soon as a little ray made
its way into the doleful prison

00:52:11.168 --> 00:52:15.561
and I discerned in four faces my
own look, I bit both hands for

00:52:15.561 --> 00:52:18.724
grief;
and they, thinking I did it

00:52:18.724 --> 00:52:23.000
from a desire to eat,
rose up suddenly and said,

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.639
'Father it would be far less
pain for us if thou eat of us.

00:52:28.639 --> 00:52:34.210
Thou didst clothe us with this
wretched flesh and do thou strip

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:35.289
us of it.'
 

00:52:35.289 --> 00:52:38.184
I calmed myself then,
not to make them more unhappy,

00:52:38.184 --> 00:52:40.739
that day and the next we stayed
all silent.

00:52:40.739 --> 00:52:43.630
Ah hard earth,
why didst thou not open?

00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:47.878
When we had come to the fourth
day Gaddo threw himself

00:52:47.878 --> 00:52:52.606
outstretched at my feet saying,
'My father why dost thou not

00:52:52.606 --> 00:52:53.650
help me?'
 

00:52:53.650 --> 00:53:00.242
I don't think it's far fetched
if I were to ask you to overhear

00:53:00.242 --> 00:53:05.239
behind this question of one of
the children,

00:53:05.239 --> 00:53:10.070
exactly an echo of the prayer
of Jesus on the Cross that we

00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:13.949
heard,
that we read, a few cantos back.

00:53:13.949 --> 00:53:20.005
There is a way in which the
violence inflicted on Ugolino's

00:53:20.005 --> 00:53:26.063
children seems to repeat or
re-enact the great drama of the

00:53:26.063 --> 00:53:28.570
Christian sacrifice.
 

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:33.500
"There he died,"
also crucified,

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:35.949
in fact, "there he died
and,

00:53:35.949 --> 00:53:38.947
as thou seest me,
I saw the three drop one by one

00:53:38.947 --> 00:53:41.260
during the fifth day and the
sixth;

00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:43.429
therefore I gave myself,
now blind."

00:53:43.429 --> 00:53:45.753
That's what it is,
the lack of perspective:

00:53:45.753 --> 00:53:46.750
he sees nothing.
 

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:49.476
He therefore has no distance
from anything,

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:53.501
nor can he tell things apart or
distinguish things one from the

00:53:53.501 --> 00:53:54.800
other, "...
 

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:59.067
to groping over each and for
two days called on them after

00:53:59.067 --> 00:54:00.340
they were dead.
 

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:04.409
Then fasting had more power
than grief."

00:54:04.409 --> 00:54:09.202
An extraordinarily ambiguous
line because we really do not

00:54:09.202 --> 00:54:11.219
know what he's saying.
 

00:54:11.219 --> 00:54:13.795
According to Rodin,
for instance,

00:54:13.795 --> 00:54:18.463
who will go on making a statue
of this, it's at the--at the

00:54:18.463 --> 00:54:21.199
MOMA, you can go and see that.
 

00:54:21.199 --> 00:54:26.358
The story is that of--that
Ugolino ate his own children,

00:54:26.358 --> 00:54:31.329
"then fasting had more
power than grief."

00:54:31.329 --> 00:54:36.661
I yielded to the appetites,
the urging of hunger more than

00:54:36.661 --> 00:54:37.409
grief.
 

00:54:37.409 --> 00:54:40.320
Or maybe he's saying just
something else.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:43.865
Maybe he's saying then fasting
had more power than grief,

00:54:43.865 --> 00:54:47.286
I really died of fasting for
hunger rather than for the

00:54:47.286 --> 00:54:47.920
grief.
 

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.284
We don't know,
and I think that part of the

00:54:51.284 --> 00:54:55.449
tragic mode that Dante is trying
to convey to us,

00:54:55.449 --> 00:54:57.480
is that we are left--and this
is by the way,

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.309
is Borges' reading.
 

00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:05.659
Borges writes nine lectures on
Dante, what else?

00:55:05.659 --> 00:55:08.699
Realizing the importance of
number nine for Dante,

00:55:08.699 --> 00:55:12.237
he writes nine lectures on
Dante and one of them is on the

00:55:12.237 --> 00:55:13.539
story of Ugolino.
 

00:55:13.539 --> 00:55:16.570
And he says,
he actually wants us to leave--

00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:18.500
he wants to leave us in
suspension,

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:22.117
to believe that it's possible
that he may have been eating the

00:55:22.117 --> 00:55:24.969
children,
but maybe it is the sensibility

00:55:24.969 --> 00:55:29.114
of so many critics have been
offended by this suggestion that

00:55:29.114 --> 00:55:33.119
he actually could go on
cannibalizing his own children.

00:55:33.119 --> 00:55:37.740
I think that Borges is right,
that we are not supposed to be

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:41.657
able to tell apart,
that the ambiguity of that line

00:55:41.657 --> 00:55:44.789
is never going to be quite
resolved.

00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:46.980
It's going to be forever there.
 

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.356
But, the most important element
of this tragic occurrence and

00:55:50.356 --> 00:55:53.003
Dante--before I go on let me
just say, "Ah,

00:55:53.003 --> 00:55:53.960
Pisa..."
 

00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.311
Dante goes on into an
apostrophe against Pisa,

00:55:57.311 --> 00:56:02.230
again with this language of now
he talks, he breaks the silence.

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:04.396
"Ah Pisa,
shame of the peoples of the

00:56:04.396 --> 00:56:07.250
fair land where sounds the
sì..."

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:10.184
Another little touch,
another little echo of the

00:56:10.184 --> 00:56:12.119
De vulgari eloquentia.
 

00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:14.585
That is to say,
in the moment where he's

00:56:14.585 --> 00:56:18.188
dealing with treachery,
which I call the most

00:56:18.188 --> 00:56:22.376
nihilistic of all sins,
because you really declare null

00:56:22.376 --> 00:56:25.369
and void any bond that you may
have with others,

00:56:25.369 --> 00:56:31.182
he uses, and the irony is,
to me, glaring the affirmative

00:56:31.182 --> 00:56:31.909
part.
 

00:56:31.909 --> 00:56:34.610
As if here, there is a possible
affirmation, there is none.

00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:34.967
"...
 

00:56:34.967 --> 00:56:36.400
where sounds the
sì,

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:40.606
since thy neighbors are slow to
punish thee make Capraia and

00:56:40.606 --> 00:56:44.811
Gorgona shift and put a bar on
Arno's mouth so that it drown

00:56:44.811 --> 00:56:46.880
every soul in thee."
 

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.079
This is really the kind of
language that Ugolino himself

00:56:50.079 --> 00:56:53.280
had used when before the
consumation of the tragedy,

00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:56.489
he really begs the earth for an
earthquake,

00:56:56.489 --> 00:57:00.300
that the earth may open up and
swallow all of them.

00:57:00.300 --> 00:57:02.590
Here Dante is using exactly the
same language.

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.510
The idea that it is so
horrifying, he's a spectacle;

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:08.523
that he has been in the tragic
spectacle he has been

00:57:08.523 --> 00:57:12.070
witnessing, that the whole world
here could be an apocalyptic

00:57:12.070 --> 00:57:13.489
ending to the world.
 

00:57:13.489 --> 00:57:17.385
To go back to the key
issue--there may not be time for

00:57:17.385 --> 00:57:20.179
a discussion today and I
apologize--

00:57:20.179 --> 00:57:25.476
but the real tragic event
though, what is the tragic event

00:57:25.476 --> 00:57:26.869
other than...
 

00:57:26.869 --> 00:57:29.440
"What if Count Ugolino had
the name of betraying thy

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.152
strongholds,
thou shouldst not have put his

00:57:32.152 --> 00:57:35.590
children to such torment,"
So this has been the

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:37.480
crucifixion of innocence.
 

00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:40.650
"Their youthful years,
thou new Thebes,"

00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:43.599
Pisa is the new Thebes,
a new Thebaid that we have been

00:57:43.599 --> 00:57:45.056
witnessing now,
"...

00:57:45.056 --> 00:57:48.559
made them innocent,
Uguccione and Brigata and the

00:57:48.559 --> 00:57:51.768
other two named already in my
song."

00:57:51.768 --> 00:57:54.969
This is really the
tragic--Dante has been using now

00:57:54.969 --> 00:57:58.197
the tragic language indeed,
that he had been hoping and

00:57:58.197 --> 00:58:01.056
theorizing in the De vulgari
eloquentia and then they

00:58:01.056 --> 00:58:01.590
move on.
 

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:04.110
What is the really tragic
occurrence?

00:58:04.110 --> 00:58:07.253
The tragic occurrence is in the
very presence of the

00:58:07.253 --> 00:58:09.780
Christological language in this
canto,

00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:15.842
because the sacrifice of the
cross means one thing and one

00:58:15.842 --> 00:58:22.329
thing only: that now that all
violence is finished and because

00:58:22.329 --> 00:58:27.306
we have found the scapegoat,
the voluntary scapegoat,

00:58:27.306 --> 00:58:30.793
who goes around saying that
we're all innocent and that he

00:58:30.793 --> 00:58:32.898
is the guilty one,
that's how we are

00:58:32.898 --> 00:58:34.639
declared--that's how we are
redeemed,

00:58:34.639 --> 00:58:42.429
that's why we are made innocent
once again, right?

00:58:42.429 --> 00:58:45.804
The story here,
re-enacting and echoing the

00:58:45.804 --> 00:58:48.617
story of the cross,
seems to say the

00:58:48.617 --> 00:58:53.679
futility--seems to announce the
futility of that sacrifice.

00:58:53.679 --> 00:58:57.518
Retrospectively,
he says that that sacrifice too

00:58:57.518 --> 00:59:02.012
was just one of the senseless
acts of violence that have

00:59:02.012 --> 00:59:06.670
happened in history and that
punctuate human history.

00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:10.139
Of course, this is not the end
of the poem,

00:59:10.139 --> 00:59:13.090
but it's the most desperate
part of the poem,

00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:20.260
because Dante comes to believe
that the law of history,

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:23.300
that the law of the world is
really a tragic law.

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.710
And there is something absolute
about it, and not quite

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:27.469
escapable.
 

00:59:27.469 --> 00:59:32.106
We shall see how he's going to
move through this and I really

00:59:32.106 --> 00:59:35.429
have to go into Canto XXXIV a
little bit.

00:59:35.429 --> 00:59:37.090
I will not say too much this
time.

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:39.690
Canto XXXIV is where Dante
meets Satan.

00:59:39.690 --> 00:59:43.710
So the encounter with Satan is,
first of all,

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:46.375
that which gives incredible
coherence to the whole movement

00:59:46.375 --> 00:59:48.588
of Inferno,
because as you remember the

00:59:48.588 --> 00:59:51.179
story of Inferno began
with the neutral angels,

00:59:51.179 --> 00:59:55.739
those who had been sitting,
watching the spectacle of the

00:59:55.739 --> 00:59:57.940
disruption of the cosmos.
 

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:02.775
Now the neutral angels at the
time of the Lucifer's rebellion

01:00:02.775 --> 01:00:05.072
of--
against God and now it ends

01:00:05.072 --> 01:00:08.101
with Lucifer,
so it's really as a kind of

01:00:08.101 --> 01:00:10.920
angelic,
cosmic proportion.

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:14.469
The other thing that I have to
say is that if you imagine,

01:00:14.469 --> 01:00:18.175
those of you who are readers of
Milton and Paradise

01:00:18.175 --> 01:00:21.827
Lost,
and you know what a brilliant

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:27.829
rhetorician Satan-- Lucifer--is
in Paradise Lost,

01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:29.679
you'll be disappointed.
 

01:00:29.679 --> 01:00:32.061
In fact, T.S. Eliot,
who writes a commentary of

01:00:32.061 --> 01:00:34.592
this,
he says, I really recommend the

01:00:34.592 --> 01:00:38.420
first time readers of the
Divine Comedy to skip Canto

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.639
XXXIV because it's strange that
Lucifer-- Satan doesn't speak.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.679
And that was exactly the point
that, I'm sorry to say,

01:00:45.679 --> 01:00:47.056
T.S. Eliot,
at this time,

01:00:47.056 --> 01:00:49.980
really had probably had never
read the De vulgari

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.300
eloquentia.
 

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.567
He's not supposed to speak,
because he's one of the angels

01:00:54.567 --> 01:00:57.090
who really do not use the human
language,

01:00:57.090 --> 01:01:01.967
but more importantly,
because he represents evil

01:01:01.967 --> 01:01:03.110
defeated.
 

01:01:03.110 --> 01:01:07.885
From this point of view,
Canto XXXIV stands in radical

01:01:07.885 --> 01:01:10.860
sharp contrast to Canto XXXIII.
 

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:14.668
In Canto XXXIII we saw--we have
witnessed the sovereignty of

01:01:14.668 --> 01:01:15.119
evil.
 

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:18.771
It is as if it were all
engulfing and hovering over all

01:01:18.771 --> 01:01:19.650
of reality.
 

01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:24.876
Here now we witness exactly the
opposite, how Satan becomes a

01:01:24.876 --> 01:01:29.579
reified, dumb object and
actually an instrument for the

01:01:29.579 --> 01:01:31.409
pilgrim's ascent.
 

01:01:31.409 --> 01:01:36.498
It's going through the body of
Lucifer that the pilgrim can go

01:01:36.498 --> 01:01:38.646
on,
and the guide and Virgil can

01:01:38.646 --> 01:01:42.409
turn themselves upside down and
finally re-emerge to the light.

01:01:42.409 --> 01:01:44.360
The rest of the canto--good.
 

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.684
I think that we are going to
have a few minutes,

01:01:45.684 --> 01:01:47.320
but I have to say something
about the rest of the canto.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:53.059
The rest of the canto deals
with a cosmological argument and

01:01:53.059 --> 01:01:59.090
the cosmological argument is
where does Purgatory come from?

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:02.273
And Dante gives an
extraordinary--invents--a poetic

01:02:02.273 --> 01:02:02.719
myth.
 

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:07.463
And the poetic myth that he
invents is that when Lucifer

01:02:07.463 --> 01:02:11.949
fell at the time of the grand
angelic disruption,

01:02:11.949 --> 01:02:16.750
the first rebellion against the
Deity,

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:21.092
the earth retreats out of fear
at the approaching of this

01:02:21.092 --> 01:02:25.047
fallen angel and re-emerges on
the other side of the

01:02:25.047 --> 01:02:28.150
hemisphere, the southern
hemisphere.

01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:30.369
That's the beginning of
Purgatory.

01:02:30.369 --> 01:02:33.480
You see the connection from an
evil act,

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:38.137
the chances of redemption,
how in affecting Dante's

01:02:38.137 --> 01:02:41.186
cosmos,
there is nothing which cannot

01:02:41.186 --> 01:02:44.117
be utilized,
no evil which cannot be

01:02:44.117 --> 01:02:46.940
utilized to the ends of the
good.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:51.208
Everything--the real defeat of
evil is when that itself can

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:55.697
become the stepping stone over
the threshold of evil itself in

01:02:55.697 --> 01:02:58.789
order to reach the purgatorial
island.

01:02:58.789 --> 01:03:01.952
The last little detail that I
will tell you is--I ask you to

01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:03.666
read the last line of Canto XXX.
 

01:03:03.666 --> 01:03:04.739
You'll like this.
 

01:03:04.739 --> 01:03:06.989
It's a little detail that
you'll like, I hope.

01:03:06.989 --> 01:03:09.960
The last line of Inferno
is: e quindi

01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.411
uscimmo a
riveder le

01:03:12.411 --> 01:03:15.610
stele--
and therefore we came out to

01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:17.710
see once again the stars.
 

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:24.483
Just a little detail to remind
you about the extraordinary love

01:03:24.483 --> 01:03:30.224
of symmetry in Dante's poem,
that each canticle will end

01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:33.280
with that same word
stele,

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:35.289
stars, stars, and stars.
 

01:03:35.289 --> 01:03:40.195
That is to say each canticle
ends with us looking up,

01:03:40.195 --> 01:03:46.139
reminding us of where we are
and still longing for the stars.

01:03:46.139 --> 01:03:51.456
I have come to--in a hurry I
have reached the end of the--of

01:03:51.456 --> 01:03:52.989
Inferno.
 

01:03:52.989 --> 01:03:55.762
There's Purgatory now
and then see if there are

01:03:55.762 --> 01:03:56.389
questions.
 

01:04:06.889 --> 01:04:08.510
Yes?
 

01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:12.786
Student:  Can you say a
little bit more about how Dante

01:04:12.786 --> 01:04:17.134
was trying to construct almost
like a total perspective through

01:04:17.134 --> 01:04:20.429
his construction of the various
languages,

01:04:20.429 --> 01:04:23.666
from seeing different forms of
Italian and trying to get an all

01:04:23.666 --> 01:04:26.699
encompassing perspective,
can you say how that relates

01:04:26.699 --> 01:04:26.980
too?
 

01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:28.463
Prof: Yeah,
the question is,

01:04:28.463 --> 01:04:29.860
can I say more--good question.
 

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:33.327
The question is can I say more
about how Dante's trying to

01:04:33.327 --> 01:04:36.250
construct how he uses total
perspectives and--

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:40.199
you mean both in the De
vulgari eloquentia and here?

01:04:40.199 --> 01:04:42.525
Yes, thank you,
because in effect,

01:04:42.525 --> 01:04:46.822
I was hoping that someone would
ask me this question because I

01:04:46.822 --> 01:04:49.500
really did not tell you how
this--

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.585
the De vulgari
eloquentia is completed here

01:04:52.585 --> 01:04:56.556
and why couldn't Dante complete
the De vulgari eloquentia

01:04:56.556 --> 01:04:58.320
when he wrote the tract.
 

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:02.559
When he wrote the tract,
he wanted to unify--

01:05:02.559 --> 01:05:05.840
he believed that they are--the
dialects,

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.840
fourteen dialects in Italian,
he acknowledged,

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.670
he recognizes fourteen dialects.
 

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:17.438
He knew some of them very well
and he wanted to make a unified

01:05:17.438 --> 01:05:22.030
language out of that,
a kind of artificial language,

01:05:22.030 --> 01:05:24.289
a sort of--
let's call it Italian

01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:27.579
Esperanto: something that you
could bring together.

01:05:27.579 --> 01:05:30.360
And what he was lacking,
so much so,

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.719
that there are those scholars
who work on--

01:05:32.719 --> 01:05:34.768
who have been working--I don't
agree with that,

01:05:34.768 --> 01:05:38.090
is that almost Dante seemed to
have a kind of--

01:05:38.090 --> 01:05:46.349
seemed to be in agreement with
the so-called logicians,

01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:51.887
those who have a kind of--the
idea that language has a sort

01:05:51.887 --> 01:05:53.842
of,
let's say, a Cartesian

01:05:53.842 --> 01:05:54.659
linguistics.
 

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:59.391
There's a kind of rational
structure to it and that can be

01:05:59.391 --> 01:06:00.719
really remade.
 

01:06:00.719 --> 01:06:03.242
The point is that when he
writes the De vulgari

01:06:03.242 --> 01:06:04.840
eloquentia,
this is true.

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.521
I don't buy the idea that he's
following the logicians of the

01:06:08.521 --> 01:06:12.018
Middle Ages, the grammarians,
who are really logicians.

01:06:12.018 --> 01:06:16.916
What he really lacked was a
historical sense and the little

01:06:16.916 --> 01:06:21.900
detail that Hebrew was still the
surviving language from the

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.699
creation of man to our own time
because--

01:06:25.699 --> 01:06:27.929
and he had a good theological
argument for that,

01:06:27.929 --> 01:06:31.351
because it would be
inconceivable that the Redeemer

01:06:31.351 --> 01:06:35.184
of the world would use a
language other than the language

01:06:35.184 --> 01:06:37.579
that had been employed by Adam.
 

01:06:37.579 --> 01:06:39.449
When he comes to
Paradise,

01:06:39.449 --> 01:06:42.780
to the Divine Comedy he
completely changes view.

01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.952
In Paradiso XXVI,
as I'm going to tell you,

01:06:44.952 --> 01:06:45.840
Dante says no,
no.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.659
Hebrew disappeared
with--immediately after Adam

01:06:48.659 --> 01:06:49.090
fell.
 

01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:50.929
With the fall of Adam through
the Garden,

01:06:50.929 --> 01:06:54.519
there was no longer the primal
language and he goes on

01:06:54.519 --> 01:06:58.719
elaborating the idea that God
does not use any language of--

01:06:58.719 --> 01:07:01.293
that is to say,
human beings are the letters

01:07:01.293 --> 01:07:03.329
and syllables of God's language.
 

01:07:03.329 --> 01:07:05.733
It's not Hebrew,
it's not Latin,

01:07:05.733 --> 01:07:08.452
it's not Greek,
it's not whatever,

01:07:08.452 --> 01:07:11.909
it's not Chinese,
that's really the--We are the

01:07:11.909 --> 01:07:15.889
syllables: that's Dante's idea
of Paradiso XXVI.

01:07:15.889 --> 01:07:19.440
This was the--that's the real
change.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:22.920
What does it mean in terms of
the Inferno?

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.949
It's that he had understood
that, in order to write about a

01:07:26.949 --> 01:07:29.590
unified language,
he had to descend.

01:07:29.590 --> 01:07:35.532
He could not go on the tower
and from there watch all the

01:07:35.532 --> 01:07:39.795
qualities: aesthetic,
what is the sweet--what is the

01:07:39.795 --> 01:07:43.000
well combed language and what is
the less well combed,

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.702
the harsh language,
what are the sounds that he

01:07:45.702 --> 01:07:48.699
really should be applying and
adopt into Italian.

01:07:48.699 --> 01:07:51.998
What he really understands that
in order to have a unified

01:07:51.998 --> 01:07:55.643
language you have to descend in
the political realities of these

01:07:55.643 --> 01:07:56.280
cities?
 

01:07:56.280 --> 01:08:00.226
That's the difference between
the De vulgari eloquentia

01:08:00.226 --> 01:08:03.333
and the lower Inferno,
a sense of history,

01:08:03.333 --> 01:08:05.469
that's really the difference.
 

01:08:05.469 --> 01:08:09.586
To see this--the sense of
history--you can be in a tower

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:11.592
as Ugolino is,
and be blind,

01:08:11.592 --> 01:08:14.920
or you can be in a tower like
Nimrod is and do not even know

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:18.422
what you are talking about,
who can go on completely

01:08:18.422 --> 01:08:21.380
reversing,
messing up, and confusing the

01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:23.819
Hebrew that he should have
known.

01:08:23.819 --> 01:08:25.640
Do you understand what I'm
saying?

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.319
That's really the difference
between the two.

01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:31.631
Good question because it
allowed me to focus on a detail

01:08:31.631 --> 01:08:35.238
that I probably didn't explain
very clearly.

01:08:35.238 --> 01:08:38.435
Student:  I don't
understand how he could have

01:08:38.435 --> 01:08:40.649
said that Hebrew died at the
Fall.

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:44.479
Prof: You don't
understand why?

01:08:44.479 --> 01:08:45.912
Student:  I don't
understand how Dante could

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:47.185
think--
Prof: Make that

01:08:47.185 --> 01:08:47.680
statement?
 

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.447
Student:  Yeah,
is that what you're saying he

01:08:49.447 --> 01:08:49.689
said?
 

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:52.309
Prof: Yeah,
that's--I don't think that

01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:54.810
there are any traces of Adam's
language.

01:08:54.810 --> 01:09:01.930
The question is why--it's a
sort of predicament and I don't

01:09:01.930 --> 01:09:05.523
know if it--
he says he doesn't quite

01:09:05.523 --> 01:09:09.131
understand why--
how Dante could say that Hebrew

01:09:09.131 --> 01:09:11.118
died with the fall of man.
 

01:09:11.118 --> 01:09:15.340
That's what he--Adam will tell
him.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:17.979
He meets Adam;
he's another poet,

01:09:17.979 --> 01:09:20.710
because he's the one who names
the world.

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:22.895
Student:  Where do the
Scriptures come from in Dante's

01:09:22.895 --> 01:09:23.880
&gt;
 

01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:27.016
Prof: The Scriptures are
not in Hebrew,

01:09:27.016 --> 01:09:30.573
Scriptures are--the language of
Jesus, for instance,

01:09:30.573 --> 01:09:31.618
is Aramaic.
 

01:09:31.618 --> 01:09:34.859
We have to be careful about
what kind of--

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:40.173
the kind of--is that Adam's
language or is that the

01:09:40.173 --> 01:09:43.439
language--
it's a language that changes in

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:44.949
time,
that's all, that's all he's

01:09:44.949 --> 01:09:45.538
really saying.
 

01:09:45.538 --> 01:09:50.525
But the New Testaments are in
Aramaic, for instance,

01:09:50.525 --> 01:09:52.579
which is a dialect.
 

01:09:52.579 --> 01:09:54.899
Yes?
 

01:09:54.899 --> 01:09:58.025
Student:  So this goes
back a little bit to the last

01:09:58.025 --> 01:10:00.480
lecture,
but looking back over the

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.662
entirety of Inferno,
it seems like Dante expresses

01:10:04.662 --> 01:10:08.344
different levels,
I guess, of sympathy or pity

01:10:08.344 --> 01:10:13.390
for the people who are trapped
in certain circles of Hell,

01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:15.819
especially for the sowers of
discord,

01:10:15.819 --> 01:10:19.702
and then later in other cases,
like at the end of Canto

01:10:19.702 --> 01:10:20.350
XXXIII.
 

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:23.949
He's happy to be with Charles,
to someone who's being

01:10:23.949 --> 01:10:26.143
tormented--
Prof: Yes,

01:10:26.143 --> 01:10:27.510
Bocca degli Abati.
 

01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:28.439
Student:  What's that?
 

01:10:28.439 --> 01:10:29.158
Prof: Okay go on.
 

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:30.920
Student:  Right,
and I just--

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:36.542
it's interesting though the
re--the different relationships

01:10:36.542 --> 01:10:40.501
that Dante has to--
the different reactions he has

01:10:40.501 --> 01:10:41.908
to these punishments.
 

01:10:41.908 --> 01:10:44.060
Given that he's essentially
created all of--

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:48.680
the Inferno is supposed
to be a representation of divine

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:52.213
justice,
but it seems like overall Dante

01:10:52.213 --> 01:10:55.279
is the judge and executioner
here.

01:10:55.279 --> 01:11:01.095
Given that the whole--how
sincerely does Dante believe in

01:11:01.095 --> 01:11:02.550
this divide?
 

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.750
Does he think he's--
Prof: In this--

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:08.020
Student:  In the divide
between himself as this narrator

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:10.078
who can feel pity for the
different--

01:11:10.078 --> 01:11:14.708
for the people trapped in
different areas of Hell versus

01:11:14.708 --> 01:11:17.774
Dante as sort of the--
I mean, in some sense,

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.340
he's the creator of all of
this.

01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:20.229
Prof: Absolutely.
 

01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:22.845
Student:  He has
assigned everyone to each level

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:24.783
of Hell--I know this is a broad
thing but

01:11:24.783 --> 01:11:26.189
&gt;
 

01:11:26.189 --> 01:11:27.828
Prof: It is.
 

01:11:27.828 --> 01:11:29.149
Student: 
&gt;

01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:30.890
I kind of wanted to see some
comment on that divide.

01:11:30.890 --> 01:11:33.600
How sincerely is this a vision
to him?

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:37.560
Prof: The question is,
since Dante's--Dante,

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:41.783
the pilgrim,
has different responses to the

01:11:41.783 --> 01:11:46.672
figures whom he has created,
sometimes he's tender and

01:11:46.672 --> 01:11:49.067
sympathetic,
sometimes he just kicks them,

01:11:49.067 --> 01:11:51.479
if that's the scene that you
are referring to,

01:11:51.479 --> 01:11:56.158
and they're all his creations,
how sincere is he in his

01:11:56.158 --> 01:11:56.939
vision?
 

01:11:56.939 --> 01:12:01.268
The response is that I would
formulate it a little bit

01:12:01.268 --> 01:12:03.800
differently, but that's fine.
 

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:08.845
We agree that Dante has--is not
the indifferent spectator to all

01:12:08.845 --> 01:12:13.733
of them and I think that what
matters to him most is to show a

01:12:13.733 --> 01:12:18.698
degree of passionate involvement
with whoever they may be.

01:12:18.698 --> 01:12:22.043
He's not going to be
sentimentalizing about all of

01:12:22.043 --> 01:12:24.158
them for a number of reasons.
 

01:12:24.158 --> 01:12:26.020
He's very sentimental with his
teacher.

01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:30.680
I think he's really very
sarcastic with Pier della Vigna

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.010
whom,
you remember,

01:12:32.010 --> 01:12:35.466
he mocks at language of his,
the contrived--I thought he

01:12:35.466 --> 01:12:37.060
thought, I thought...
 

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:39.819
That's not Dante's language,
that's really Pier della

01:12:39.819 --> 01:12:42.210
Vigna's own poetry that Dante's
picking up.

01:12:42.210 --> 01:12:46.412
I think that he is very--he has
a sense of pathos,

01:12:46.412 --> 01:12:49.640
and maybe he's also seduced by
Francesca.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.909
Francesca, you can't put this
past her, that she's trying to

01:12:53.909 --> 01:12:57.384
seduce him as well as she
seduces, or lets Paolo,

01:12:57.384 --> 01:12:58.470
seduce her.
 

01:12:58.470 --> 01:13:03.956
When he comes further down,
the relationship is no longer a

01:13:03.956 --> 01:13:09.443
relationship of this tenderness,
of forms--now there's this

01:13:09.443 --> 01:13:10.390
anger.
 

01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:11.840
Anger at what?
 

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:16.015
At the extraordinary horror of
what human beings can do,

01:13:16.015 --> 01:13:20.421
and there's nothing--Dante
calls fraud, the sin peculiar to

01:13:20.421 --> 01:13:24.396
man, to human beings;
the sin peculiar to human

01:13:24.396 --> 01:13:29.384
beings because they are--they
have a reason that becomes part

01:13:29.384 --> 01:13:33.787
of their premeditations,
part of their machinations of

01:13:33.787 --> 01:13:34.618
evil.
 

01:13:34.618 --> 01:13:40.576
And I find that repulsion he
has, I find that

01:13:40.576 --> 01:13:46.939
very--dramatically speaking,
very convincing.

01:13:46.939 --> 01:13:52.344
It's still part of a judgment
that he is making and it's not

01:13:52.344 --> 01:13:56.100
an attenuation at all of that
judgment.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.788
The anger with which he attacks
Pisa,

01:13:59.788 --> 01:14:02.288
that the idea that he speaks
prophetically there,

01:14:02.288 --> 01:14:04.899
why isn't this whole place,
disappearing,

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:08.430
this is--I think that--to me
is--you could say it's sincere.

01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:10.972
I wouldn't be using that
language but I think that's it

01:14:10.972 --> 01:14:12.340
dramatically very powerful.
 

01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:17.207
And I don't know if you would
agree that that's probably the

01:14:17.207 --> 01:14:21.413
best way of referring to this
term--to describe this

01:14:21.413 --> 01:14:22.569
situation.
 

01:14:22.569 --> 01:14:24.369
Would you agree?
 

01:14:24.369 --> 01:14:25.439
Student:  Yeah.
 

01:14:25.439 --> 01:14:28.939
Prof: I find it
dramatically very apt.

01:14:28.939 --> 01:14:33.417
It's--because it's a
consequence of the genuine

01:14:33.417 --> 01:14:35.948
horror--can you imagine?
 

01:14:35.948 --> 01:14:39.774
I mean you had the
earlier--even the diviners with

01:14:39.774 --> 01:14:42.350
a shape--a human shape twisted.
 

01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:43.578
The head turned around.
 

01:14:43.578 --> 01:14:50.324
Then the alchemists,
also represented in a kind of

01:14:50.324 --> 01:14:52.390
twisted form.
 

01:14:52.390 --> 01:14:58.042
It's this twisting of the human
image and this--and the reality

01:14:58.042 --> 01:15:03.332
of what human beings can do and
ongoing and this hatred has

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:04.698
taken over.
 

01:15:04.698 --> 01:15:07.578
I think that he's approaching
them too.

01:15:07.578 --> 01:15:14.296
There is a way in which I was
saying he echoes Ugolino when

01:15:14.296 --> 01:15:18.087
Ugolino says,
'oh earth, why didn't--wasn't

01:15:18.087 --> 01:15:21.899
there an earthquake and which
would swallow everything.'

01:15:21.899 --> 01:15:25.119
I mean, the language of the
eater, the cannibal,

01:15:25.119 --> 01:15:26.078
so to speak.
 

01:15:26.078 --> 01:15:32.471
And then Dante just says:
why isn't there some kind of

01:15:32.471 --> 01:15:35.970
great drowning of all this?
 

01:15:35.970 --> 01:15:39.755
Why aren't the islands just
moving and be a barrier,

01:15:39.755 --> 01:15:42.649
so that the whole town will go
under?

01:15:42.649 --> 01:15:46.680
I think that there is a way in
which he's almost doing the same

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.198
thing.
 

01:15:47.198 --> 01:15:53.755
That's it, almost,
re-enacting the kind of sense

01:15:53.755 --> 01:16:00.310
of nothingness that Ugolino had
shown to him.

01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:03.828
Obviously, he does not agree
with Ugolino.

01:16:03.828 --> 01:16:09.930
It's not that there is a kind
of complete identification with

01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:10.538
him.
 

01:16:10.538 --> 01:16:13.279
And how do we know that this is
not going to be the case?

01:16:13.279 --> 01:16:16.270
He's writing, Ugolino isn't.
 

01:16:16.270 --> 01:16:21.823
The poem is what rescues Dante
from yielding to the temptation

01:16:21.823 --> 01:16:26.828
of absolute despair and
therefore distinguishes him--

01:16:26.828 --> 01:16:31.109
distinguishes his own temporary
impulse for nihilism,

01:16:31.109 --> 01:16:34.529
with the nihilism that
distinguishes,

01:16:34.529 --> 01:16:37.159
characterizes all the sinners
and above all,

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:38.609
the treacherous souls.
 

01:16:38.609 --> 01:16:44.234
Maybe we should stop here;
we're going to talk about

01:16:44.234 --> 01:16:47.136
something so much more serene,
Purgatory,

01:16:47.136 --> 01:16:47.939
next time.

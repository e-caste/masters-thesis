00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:03.100
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So we're
studying reaction

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.033
mechanisms this semester, but

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:11.067
we'd taken a little diversion to
look at reaction order-- 

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:14.733
how the dependence of rate on
concentration gives 

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:18.200
information about mechanism. 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.067
So this is the kinetic analog of
the law of mass action, the 

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:26.067
exponents we talked about on
concentration last semester. 

00:00:26.067 --> 00:00:30.033
And we saw last time that we
would have rate laws, the 

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:34.167
d(Product)/dt is some function
of concentration raised to 

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.433
some power. 

00:00:35.433 --> 00:00:38.933
And we looked last time at zero
order and first order and 

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.500
second order. 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.667
Now we're going to look at some
complex reactions and how 

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:47.367
they can get weird orders like
fractional orders or even 

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.467
inverse orders. 

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.567
So a fractional order: 

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:54.267
Suppose the rate is proportional
to some rate 

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:57.533
constant times the concentration
of A times the 

00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:01.567
concentration of B to the 1/4
power. 

00:01:01.567 --> 00:01:02.333
How can that be? 

00:01:02.333 --> 00:01:04.800
How can you have 1/4 of a
molecule 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.133
participate in a reaction? 

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:14.667
Well, this all depends on when a
reactive species in 

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.733
equilibrium with other species,
what is 

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.233
the dominant species? 

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:24.733
Because when you add more
material to a solution, what 

00:01:24.733 --> 00:01:28.633
you increase is the dominant
species by how much you add. 

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:30.433
If you double it you have twice
as much of 

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:32.433
the dominant species. 

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:35.033
If you triple it you have three
times as much of the 

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.067
dominant species. 

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:41.967
But suppose what's reacting is
not the dominant species, but 

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:44.200
is related to the dominant
species by 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.200
some equilibrium constant. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.700
So, for example, suppose the
dominant species were a 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.767
tetramer, four units. 

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:58.467
But the reactive species were a
monomer, a single B unit. 

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:02.900
So you have the equilibrium
between B4 and 4B. 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:09.667
Now if B4 is dominant and B is
reactive, then if you double 

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:11.067
the concentration-- 

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:15.600
or actually let's say you
increase the concentration by 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.300
a factor of 2, 4, 6, 8-- 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.800
you increase the concentration
by a factor of 8. 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.867
How much do you increase the
concentration of B4? 

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:30.267
It's practically all the stuff,
it's the dominant 

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:33.867
species, so you increase it by a
factor of 8. 

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:37.200
By how much do you increase the
concentration of the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.967
monomer, B, that's in
equilibrium with it? 

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:44.867
So if the dominant species is
proportional to how much you 

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:48.900
add, that's how much you think
you have. But the minor 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.367
species tags along following the
law of mass action. 

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:57.100
So we actually, last semester,
talked about a tetramer-- 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.433
that methyllithium gives this
distorted cubic tetramer. 

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:07.067
Remember it has four ether
molecules associated with it 

00:03:07.067 --> 00:03:09.167
if possible. 

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:13.633
But if you put in a lot more
ether then it rips the 

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:18.300
tetramer apart, because all the
oxygens want to be sharing 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.533
their electrons with lithium. 

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:26.667
So excess ether rips it apart,
first to give a dimer with two 

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:31.667
more methyl ethers per dimer
unit. 

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:35.300
And ultimately to a monomer with
another methyl ether per 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.567
monomer unit. 

00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:40.867
So each monomer now has three
dimethyl ethers. 

00:03:40.867 --> 00:03:45.133
So if you have plenty of
dimethyl ethers, then the 

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:48.467
equilibrium shifts to the right,
and most of the stuff 

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:50.133
is monomer. 

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:54.400
And if you increase the material
you put in by a 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.300
factor of 8, you'll increase the
monomer by a factor of 8. 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.633
But that's not what happened
when you don't have the excess 

00:04:04.633 --> 00:04:06.767
ether available. 

00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:12.667
Then the equilibrium lies to the
right, and when you ladle 

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:15.767
8 times as much material in--
you don't ladle it because 

00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:18.267
it's very reactive with air and
water. 

00:04:18.267 --> 00:04:21.467
But if you increase the
concentration by a factor of 

00:04:21.467 --> 00:04:25.067
4, this is what you increase by
a factor of 4. 

00:04:25.067 --> 00:04:26.967
And how do you increase that? 

00:04:26.967 --> 00:04:29.800
Well, you have this equilibrium
constant where the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.800
monomer is to the fourth power,
so the monomer to the 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.467
fourth is proportional to the
tetramer. 

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:39.867
Or you could write the same
thing, the monomer is 

00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:42.600
proportional to the tetramer to
the one fourth power. 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.833
2, 4, 8-- 

00:04:46.833 --> 00:04:49.467
16 was what I was supposed to
say, right? 

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:57.600
So if I increase the tetramer by
a factor of 16, I increase 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.567
the monomer by 16 to the one
fourth power 

00:05:02.567 --> 00:05:04.033
by: a factor of 2. 

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:07.933
So it would only double the
rate. 

00:05:07.933 --> 00:05:11.167
So reaction of monomer in a
hydrocarbon solvent turns out 

00:05:11.167 --> 00:05:15.867
to be 1/4 order in how much
reagent you add. 

00:05:15.867 --> 00:05:19.333
But the reaction order proves
then that the monomer is 

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:23.400
reactive, but the tetramer is
dominant in the hydrocarbon. 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.200
But if you have excess ether,
then the reaction shifts to 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.700
the left, and if you add 16
times as much stuff you 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.467
increase the concentration of
the monomer 

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.400
by a factor of 16. 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.233
Then it's first order in how
much stuff you added, and the 

00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:44.200
reaction becomes first order. 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.967
So that's one example of a weird
kinetic rate law, a 

00:05:49.967 --> 00:05:52.867
weird dependence on
concentration, fractional. 

00:05:52.867 --> 00:05:58.867
Suppose you had a 1/6 order
reaction? 

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:00.200
What would you infer? 

00:06:04.567 --> 00:06:05.500
Elisa? 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.633
STUDENT: That it's a hexamer. 

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:07.967
PROFESSOR: Right. 

00:06:07.967 --> 00:06:11.967
That the dominant species is a
hexamer, but the reactive 

00:06:11.967 --> 00:06:14.133
species is a monomer. 

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:15.667
Good. 

00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:22.633
Now here are two enantiomers, an
R and an S configuration of 

00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:24.667
this funny molecule that's a
little bit 

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:28.167
related to amino acids. 

00:06:28.167 --> 00:06:31.700
Now it has what are called
alpha-hydrogens-- 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.167
those are hydrogens attached to
a carbon adjacent to a 

00:06:36.167 --> 00:06:38.900
carbonyl group. 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.167
So it turns out that a base can
pull off that hydrogen, 

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:46.400
leaving an anion on that carbon,
which then is 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.767
stabilized by pi-star of the
carbonyl. 

00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:54.433
So it's easy to pull off that H
and put it back on again. 

00:06:54.433 --> 00:06:58.100
So that means that if you put
base in with these two 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.767
molecules they'll interconvert
easily. 

00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:04.767
Now that would lead to
racemization. 

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:09.033
If you started with all one
hand, you'd have a reaction 

00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:12.733
going one way which has a
certain rate constant times 

00:07:12.733 --> 00:07:17.300
the base, and a reaction going
the other way which is the 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.833
same rate constant, because
they're mirror images, times 

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:24.033
the concentration of base. 

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:28.233
Now the rate, how much goes from
one side to the other, is 

00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:32.367
the rate constant times the
concentration. 

00:07:32.367 --> 00:07:34.867
So if you have a higher
concentration of one than of 

00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:39.300
the other, its rate will be
faster. 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.100
So as it says here that since
they're identical rate 

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.600
constants for the two
enantiomers that guarantees a 

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.167
faster rate for the major
concentration, the major 

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:53.200
enantiomer going to the minor
enantiomer, until they 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.267
equilibrate, they come to 50/50,
and then the 

00:07:56.267 --> 00:07:58.500
rates will be equal. 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.800
So that's a guaranteed mechanism
for racemization. 

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.400
You have an alpha-hydrogen at
the chiral center, or the 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.333
stereogenic center. 

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:12.733
You put base in, pull it off,
put it on, and you've lost all 

00:08:12.733 --> 00:08:15.700
the effort you've put in to make
the thing a single 

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:19.267
enantiomer in the beginning. 

00:08:19.267 --> 00:08:22.400
Incidentally, how do you make
something a single enantiomer? 

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.833
When you generate something,
typically you make both right 

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:29.400
and left equally with equal
probability. 

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.767
But what you have to do,
remember as we talked about 

00:08:31.767 --> 00:08:36.367
last semester, Pasteur, one of
Pasteur's methods, is to react 

00:08:36.367 --> 00:08:41.867
it with something pre-existing
that's only one enantiomer in 

00:08:41.867 --> 00:08:44.600
some reversible reaction. 

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.733
So you can make the pair of
enantiomers into 

00:08:47.733 --> 00:08:51.867
diastereomers, separate them
perhaps by crystallization, 

00:08:51.867 --> 00:08:53.867
then take them back to what you
want. 

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.833
That's how you get one to begin
with. 

00:08:55.833 --> 00:08:58.800
It depends on having something
pre-existing 

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.133
that's a single hand. 

00:09:03.267 --> 00:09:07.133
Now these two molecules turn out
to crystallize, and they 

00:09:07.133 --> 00:09:10.367
crystallize in crystals that are
composed all of one 

00:09:10.367 --> 00:09:13.267
enantiomer or all of the other.

00:09:13.267 --> 00:09:18.333
So if you let such a mixture
crystallize, it would give 50% 

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:20.700
of one crystal, 50% of the other
crystal-- 

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:21.933
it would be racemic. 

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.467
Except if you grind it. 

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:31.000
So there was this very
interesting paper two years 

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.200
ago by a group in the
Netherlands-- 

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.633
Noorduin was the lead author-- 

00:09:36.633 --> 00:09:40.000
about grinding a suspension of
these crystals. 

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.167
That is there is these right and
left handed crystals of 

00:09:43.167 --> 00:09:44.600
that compound. 

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.100
When they're in solution they
can interconvert, because 

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.933
there's base in there. 

00:09:49.933 --> 00:09:52.767
So the molecule comes off the
crystal, goes into solution, 

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:58.600
racemizes, and then goes back on
one crystal or the other. 

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:07.200
So the experiments lasted some
time, you see, up to 50 or 60 

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.033
or 70 days. 

00:10:10.033 --> 00:10:13.667
And they looked in the solid
phase of the crystals at what 

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:17.367
the enantiomer excess was-- how
much more of one crystal 

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:20.900
there was than the other. 

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.733
And they started with a little
bit of excess of either the S, 

00:10:25.733 --> 00:10:28.867
those are the blue points, or
they R, 

00:10:28.867 --> 00:10:30.600
those are the red points. 

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.667
And I notice we have these front
lights on. 

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:37.667
I better turn those off to get
better 

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:41.267
definition on the slides. 

00:10:41.267 --> 00:10:43.533
So we have red or blue. 

00:10:43.533 --> 00:10:47.133
It could be a very tiny excess,
like 0.04%. 

00:10:47.133 --> 00:10:50.200
Now what would you expect from
what I've been telling you if 

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.033
you had base in the solution and
you start grinding to 

00:10:54.033 --> 00:10:56.967
encourage the crystals to
dissolve more rapidly? 

00:10:56.967 --> 00:10:59.133
What would you expect to happen
in time? 

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:04.033
Suppose you started with the one
that's 17% excess of S? 

00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:05.333
What would happen in time? 

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.433
Come on, be naive. 

00:11:11.867 --> 00:11:13.100
Megan, what do you think would
happen? 

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.767
STUDENT: Less enantiomeric
excess? 

00:11:17.767 --> 00:11:18.567
PROFESSOR: Can't hear very well.

00:11:18.567 --> 00:11:20.267
STUDENT: Less enantiomeric
excess? 

00:11:20.267 --> 00:11:22.667
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it would go to
zero in enantiomer excess, 

00:11:22.667 --> 00:11:24.100
it would go to 50/50. 

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.933
So you'd expect a curve that
would look like this. 

00:11:26.933 --> 00:11:29.000
It would go along, depending on
how fast it is, it would 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.467
become zero. 

00:11:30.467 --> 00:11:31.967
This is what actually happened.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.633
So it DE-racemized. 

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.100
It became a single enantiomer. 

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.933
Whatever was in excess at the
beginning, all the crystals 

00:11:50.933 --> 00:11:52.200
became that. 

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.200
So this is very different from
what we were talking about 

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.333
before where the rate law
guarantees that whatever's in 

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:05.167
excess will go more rapidly to
the minor than the minor to 

00:12:05.167 --> 00:12:08.333
the major, and it's guaranteed
to come out 50/50. 

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:10.833
This one goes exactly the
opposite. 

00:12:10.833 --> 00:12:15.267
So this was a great puzzle, what
caused this to happen. 

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:18.267
It could be that there's faster
conversion 

00:12:18.267 --> 00:12:21.567
of the minor crystals. 

00:12:21.567 --> 00:12:26.500
So that if you have, say, more
R than S, it's faster to go 

00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:32.533
from S to R than from R to
S. What would that say 

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:33.767
about the rate law? 

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:41.833
If the less concentration you
have, the fewer crystals, the 

00:12:41.833 --> 00:12:43.967
faster it goes. 

00:12:45.367 --> 00:12:47.233
It's an inverse rate law. 

00:12:50.067 --> 00:12:51.500
That certainly sounds weird. 

00:12:54.033 --> 00:12:56.800
But there's another interesting
thing. 

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.700
The lines have a curious shape.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.600
Do you see what's funny about as
a reaction goes along 

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:07.300
having this kind of shape or
this kind of shape? 

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.400
Remember, we looked last time at
a first-order reaction or a 

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.433
second-order reaction, what it
looked like. 

00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:15.100
You started with a given
starting material and what 

00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.733
happened in time? 

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:19.567
It went to product. 

00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:21.567
It went to zero concentration. 

00:13:21.567 --> 00:13:22.400
But how do it go? 

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.667
It went like this, because the
more of it there was the 

00:13:27.667 --> 00:13:30.067
faster it was going-- 

00:13:30.067 --> 00:13:33.633
half-life, half-life, half-life.

00:13:33.633 --> 00:13:37.067
This seems to be backwards. 

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:40.033
And you see it both in the fact
that it goes all to one, 

00:13:40.033 --> 00:13:43.633
to the major one, and in the
fact that you 

00:13:43.633 --> 00:13:44.800
have these funny curves. 

00:13:48.367 --> 00:13:55.300
Now the explanation is that when
you're grinding you make 

00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:02.233
tiny, tiny pieces that are
guaranteed to dissolve. 

00:14:02.233 --> 00:14:06.167
So grinding accelerates
dissolution by making very 

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:09.667
tiny crystals below the critical
size that we talked 

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:11.167
about last semester. 

00:14:11.167 --> 00:14:14.367
So they'll dissolve, they won't
grow. 

00:14:14.367 --> 00:14:19.900
Except they can be rescued from
dissolution by combining 

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:22.533
with another crystal of the same
kind. 

00:14:22.533 --> 00:14:28.733
So the crystal could grow not by
adding one molecule at a 

00:14:28.733 --> 00:14:33.000
time, but by two small crystals
coming together. 

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.133
Now that's going to be second
order in how many of these 

00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:39.867
little pieces there are. 

00:14:39.867 --> 00:14:42.467
If two things are coming
together, two A's are coming 

00:14:42.467 --> 00:14:48.000
together, that second order in
A. So the more stuff there is 

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.367
the faster it avoids
dissolution. 

00:14:52.367 --> 00:14:56.100
So really it's a second-order
process of avoiding 

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:57.767
dissolution. 

00:14:57.767 --> 00:15:00.767
But that means that if you're
looking at the dissolution, 

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:04.167
which allows stuff to go from
one to the other, that's 

00:15:04.167 --> 00:15:09.433
faster if you have less stuff
because you don't save it. 

00:15:09.433 --> 00:15:14.933
So the majority solid dissolves
more slowly than the 

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:19.600
minority solid does, because it
could be saved by a second- 

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.700
order process. 

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:28.267
But the key to understanding
this really weird phenomenon 

00:15:28.267 --> 00:15:32.333
was the kinetics, to see that
the lines 

00:15:32.333 --> 00:15:35.233
had these funny shapes. 

00:15:35.233 --> 00:15:39.033
That's what clued people in to
the idea that it was this 

00:15:39.033 --> 00:15:42.933
coalescence of little shards of
crystals that made the 

00:15:42.933 --> 00:15:43.633
thing to do this. 

00:15:43.633 --> 00:15:46.867
And this could be of interest.
The people who do this, the 

00:15:46.867 --> 00:15:49.300
reason they're motivated to do
it other than they just think 

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.500
it's cool, is people have always
wondered how it is that 

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.767
in the biosphere things had a
single hand, that all amino 

00:15:57.767 --> 00:16:03.067
acids are L-amino acids and all
sugars are D-sugars, or 

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:06.867
most sugars at least. How did
things get resolved in the 

00:16:06.867 --> 00:16:10.867
first place when there wasn't
anything preresolved to do 

00:16:10.867 --> 00:16:13.600
this separation we talked about?

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.433
But this can start at 50/50. 

00:16:17.433 --> 00:16:21.300
If you have a lot of particles,
it's never exactly 50/50-- 

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.400
there'll be a little bit more of
one than the other. 

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.667
So one of them will be saved
from dissolution a little more 

00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:30.833
than the other, an ultimately
that one will build up 

00:16:30.833 --> 00:16:31.933
autocatalytically-- 

00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:35.533
the more it goes, the faster it
goes. 

00:16:35.533 --> 00:16:41.267
So that seems to be the
explanation of this phenomenon 

00:16:41.267 --> 00:16:43.633
that could, indeed, have
something to do with the 

00:16:43.633 --> 00:16:47.233
origin of single handedness in
the biosphere. 

00:16:47.233 --> 00:16:49.733
But the key to understanding it
was the 

00:16:49.733 --> 00:16:52.367
kinetics, the rate law. 

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.600
So we've seen the guidance that
rate laws can provide for 

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:02.667
understanding reaction
mechanisms-- 

00:17:02.667 --> 00:17:07.233
zeroth order, that's when the
catalyst is saturated. 

00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:09.767
First order is the normal
business. 

00:17:09.767 --> 00:17:12.367
Second order when two things
have to get together. 

00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:15.833
Fractional order when things
have to come apart. 

00:17:15.833 --> 00:17:19.267
And negative order, in this
case, although you could argue 

00:17:19.267 --> 00:17:21.667
that it's actually second order,
but it appears to be 

00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:28.700
negative order, that the minor
stuff goes more rapidly. 

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.200
So now back to what we were
talking about, the reaction 

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.900
we're talking about, which is
bond dissociation to generate 

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.133
free radicals. 

00:17:37.133 --> 00:17:40.667
The reason we're talking about
that is try to figure out how 

00:17:40.667 --> 00:17:45.367
you can predict rate constants
from things we already know. 

00:17:45.367 --> 00:17:51.633
So we're studying free-radical
substitutions for this purpose 

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:54.567
because a) they're simple. 

00:17:54.567 --> 00:17:57.767
There's minimal influence from
the solvent, so you can just 

00:17:57.767 --> 00:18:00.867
look at the molecules that are
doing the reaction and try to 

00:18:00.867 --> 00:18:02.600
understand the rates. 

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:05.233
They also turn out to be very
important, these 

00:18:05.233 --> 00:18:07.267
free-radical reactions. 

00:18:07.267 --> 00:18:10.233
They're very important in
atmospheric chemistry.

00:18:10.233 --> 00:18:12.200
So there's a lot of work done on
them in,

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:14.900
say, Boulder, Colorado, where

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:20.967
the Atmospheric Administration
and the Joint Institute for 

00:18:20.967 --> 00:18:23.967
Laboratory Astrophysics are very
interested in 

00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:26.167
these kinds of things. 

00:18:26.167 --> 00:18:28.867
They're important in combustion,

00:18:28.867 --> 00:18:30.000
you make free radicals. 

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.100
Also in oxidation reactions that
we'll 

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.367
talk about more later. 

00:18:35.367 --> 00:18:39.033
In terms of strictly organic
chemistry, they provide great 

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:41.433
examples of selectivity. 

00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:45.000
And that's a pervasive theme, as
I say here, in synthesis 

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.600
and in biochemistry. 

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:50.467
Almost always with any kind of
complicated molecule, the 

00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:53.833
problem is not what can react--

00:18:53.833 --> 00:18:56.767
there are always lots of
different ways of reacting. 

00:18:56.767 --> 00:19:00.100
The question is how you can be
selective and do one thing 

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:01.367
rather than another. 

00:19:01.367 --> 00:19:04.433
That's often the problem in
organic synthesis-- 

00:19:04.433 --> 00:19:05.867
is being selective. 

00:19:05.867 --> 00:19:10.800
And the free-radical reactions
are a very simple example of 

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:13.833
showing something about
selectivity, as we'll see 

00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:16.533
later in the lecture. 

00:19:16.533 --> 00:19:21.567
So last time we were looking at
this table of experimental 

00:19:21.567 --> 00:19:24.167
bond dissociation energies, bond

00:19:24.167 --> 00:19:25.533
enthalpies as they're called. 

00:19:25.533 --> 00:19:29.267
There are a zillion of them and
they're known very well. 

00:19:29.267 --> 00:19:32.300
But what we would like to
understand is why. 

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.267
Why do they have these values? 

00:19:34.267 --> 00:19:36.600
So you don't have to memorize
the whole table. 

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.467
That is, do you just have to
suck it up and memorize this, 

00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:42.333
or can you understand this kind
of lore-- 

00:19:42.333 --> 00:19:48.033
what the rate constant should
be, what the energy should be 

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:49.567
for the strength of these bonds
that 

00:19:49.567 --> 00:19:52.800
you're trying to break? 

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.733
Well, it's very difficult to
predict exactly what these 

00:19:56.733 --> 00:19:58.400
energies should be. 

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.567
But often you can predict
relative energies. 

00:20:01.567 --> 00:20:05.867
If you'd know one, you can
predict another one. 

00:20:05.867 --> 00:20:12.233
so most often in exams,
questions I'd ask on exams, 

00:20:12.233 --> 00:20:15.433
It's not a question of knowing
the precise rate, but if you 

00:20:15.433 --> 00:20:18.567
knew the rate for this, what
would the rate for this be? 

00:20:18.567 --> 00:20:21.333
And you notice that it has to do
with selectivity, when you 

00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:24.767
have two processes that are
analogous to one another that 

00:20:24.767 --> 00:20:29.200
can go on, how much better
should one be than the other? 

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.600
That's much easier to get the
relative values than to get 

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:33.867
the absolute values. 

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.400
We started last time looking at
this, in the case of the 

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:44.400
bonds to methyl from the various
halogens. 

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.700
Remember, that it has to do with
overlap? 

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.467
That as you make the halogens
bigger the 

00:20:49.467 --> 00:20:51.000
overlap isn't so good. 

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.900
And also that has to do with
energy 

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:55.267
match between the orbitals-- 

00:20:55.267 --> 00:20:57.767
we talked about this last
lecture. 

00:20:57.767 --> 00:21:01.200
We also talked about other cases
where the 

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.667
radicals were unusual. 

00:21:02.667 --> 00:21:06.033
That, remember, had to do with
starting material, how strong 

00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:07.167
the bond is. 

00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:11.033
But then others had to do with
how stable the radicals were. 

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:17.567
Like the hybridization of the
C-H and the resonance-- 

00:21:17.567 --> 00:21:21.533
the SOMO mixing with pi and
pi*, we talked about that 

00:21:21.533 --> 00:21:22.433
last time-- 

00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:25.800
has to do with the radical,
whereas the hybridization that 

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:28.933
explains the strong ones has to
do with the starting 

00:21:28.933 --> 00:21:31.533
material, how strong the C-H
bonds are. 

00:21:31.533 --> 00:21:33.300
So we've done that. 

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:38.967
Now let's look at a more subtle
example, which is as we 

00:21:38.967 --> 00:21:43.667
go from one alkyl radical to
another, breaking hydrogens 

00:21:43.667 --> 00:21:50.900
off from carbon, but from just
different alkanes. 

00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:52.900
And the first thing we notice
there is that 

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:54.400
they're not very different. 

00:21:57.267 --> 00:22:03.700
You can explain this by saying
that the carbon-carbon bond is 

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:07.233
more sensitive to hybridization,
its energy, 

00:22:07.233 --> 00:22:10.533
than the carbon-hydrogen bond
is. 

00:22:10.533 --> 00:22:13.967
Now when you go from a
tetrahedral carbon, the 

00:22:13.967 --> 00:22:17.900
starting material, you pull off
an H and get a radical, 

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:19.867
which is trigonal. 

00:22:19.867 --> 00:22:25.000
You go from sp3 to sp2 bonds. 

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.500
And the sp2 bonds, as we saw
last semester, overlap better 

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:30.400
and give stronger bonds. 

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.300
That's fine. 

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.533
That'll be true, they'll be
stronger if they're bonded to 

00:22:33.533 --> 00:22:37.967
hydrogen; they'll be stronger if
they're bonded to carbon. 

00:22:37.967 --> 00:22:41.333
But it turns out that
carbon-carbon bonds are more 

00:22:41.333 --> 00:22:46.567
sensitive to the hybridization
than carbon-H is. 

00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:50.367
So if when you're pulling the
hydrogen off from your 

00:22:50.367 --> 00:22:54.200
tetrahedral carbon there are
other carbons attached to that 

00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:00.167
carbon, then in the process of
going to the radical you'll 

00:23:00.167 --> 00:23:03.833
get more extra stability than
you would have if there had 

00:23:03.833 --> 00:23:07.367
been hydrogens there, because
the carbons profit from the 

00:23:07.367 --> 00:23:09.733
change in hybridization more
than the 

00:23:09.733 --> 00:23:12.100
hydrogens would have done. 

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.867
So that's what we see here. 

00:23:13.867 --> 00:23:17.400
Methyl, which has three
hydrogens is 

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.967
hard to form the radical-- 

00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:21.467
104.9. 

00:23:21.467 --> 00:23:25.867
But it gets easier and easier
and easier as you go to more 

00:23:25.867 --> 00:23:29.400
and more carbon-carbon bonds
rather than hydrogen-carbon 

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.533
bonds on the radical you're
making. 

00:23:31.533 --> 00:23:33.733
So that's one explanation: that
the 

00:23:33.733 --> 00:23:35.200
carbon-carbon is more sensitive.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.500
And that's to say that that's
why the 

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:39.433
radical is more stable. 

00:23:39.433 --> 00:23:43.033
It has to do with the stability
of the radical. 

00:23:43.033 --> 00:23:46.367
The other possibility is
analogous to what we saw over 

00:23:46.367 --> 00:23:51.033
here in the allyl and benzyl
cases. 

00:23:51.033 --> 00:23:55.867
It was where the SOMO mixes with
pi and pi* on 

00:23:55.867 --> 00:23:58.967
the adjacent carbon. 

00:23:58.967 --> 00:24:01.833
So we're going to pull a
hydrogen off here, make a 

00:24:01.833 --> 00:24:03.567
radical, a p-orbital here. 

00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:07.000
If we had a pi system here
that could overlap with that

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.433
we mix it with pi, mix with
pi*, and get 

00:24:09.433 --> 00:24:10.300
stabilization. 

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.333
We looked at that last time. 

00:24:12.333 --> 00:24:15.100
Now, of course, if you have a
hydrogen here attached to the 

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.033
carbon from which the hydrogen
is being lost, it's 

00:24:19.033 --> 00:24:23.200
orthogonal; it can't overlap
with the p-orbital here. 

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.100
But if you have a carbon here
with a hydrogen on it, then 

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.567
that s and s* bond of C-H can

00:24:31.567 --> 00:24:34.800
overlap with the p-orbital. 

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.467
So you can get the same kind of
mixing that you get with pi 

00:24:38.467 --> 00:24:41.633
and pi*, except it's s and
s*. 

00:24:41.633 --> 00:24:44.400
So they're much further away in
energy-- the energy match 

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.967
is much poorer with this
p-orbital. 

00:24:46.967 --> 00:24:50.533
So you don't expect it to be a
very big phenomenon, and the 

00:24:50.533 --> 00:24:54.767
changes here, indeed, are not
nearly as big as they were for 

00:24:54.767 --> 00:24:56.533
benzyl and allyl. 

00:24:56.533 --> 00:24:59.933
But those are the explanations
that are standard for 

00:24:59.933 --> 00:25:03.267
explaining why more substituted

00:25:03.267 --> 00:25:06.000
radicals are more stable. 

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.833
That's what people say, so it's
easier to break the bond. 

00:25:08.833 --> 00:25:11.267
That is, they say that it has to
do with 

00:25:11.267 --> 00:25:13.867
this radical stability. 

00:25:13.867 --> 00:25:18.100
Notice we're assuming that the
bond dissociation energy 

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.767
difference, as you go across
from methyl to ethyl to 

00:25:20.767 --> 00:25:24.033
isopropyl to t-butyl is due to
differences in radical 

00:25:24.033 --> 00:25:26.800
stabilities, not the differences
in the starting 

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:29.133
material energy. 

00:25:29.133 --> 00:25:32.367
Remember, it could be either. 

00:25:32.367 --> 00:25:36.300
The standard explanations are in
terms of the radical. 

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.033
And what I'm going to show you
now is that 

00:25:38.033 --> 00:25:39.267
that's not so obvious. 

00:25:41.933 --> 00:25:44.367
Even though I think it would be
interesting for you to look 

00:25:44.367 --> 00:25:48.000
in these various textbooks that
you have at this subject 

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.867
about free-radical
halogenation-- 

00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:53.033
every one of them will have a
chapter about that. 

00:25:53.033 --> 00:25:56.567
And see what they say about what
the explanation is. 

00:25:56.567 --> 00:25:58.833
Some of them won't give any
explanation at all, they'll 

00:25:58.833 --> 00:26:02.600
just say more substituted
radicals are more stable. 

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.433
But those which give an
explanation 

00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:05.467
will give one of these. 

00:26:05.467 --> 00:26:09.033
But I want to show you that it's
not so obvious that 

00:26:09.033 --> 00:26:10.600
that's true. 

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:17.067
If it were true, we can test it
by checking more examples. 

00:26:17.067 --> 00:26:20.567
Instead of looking only at
hydrogen breaking away to give 

00:26:20.567 --> 00:26:25.300
those different radicals, we
could break other things away. 

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.667
There's not enough data for
fluorine, but chlorine, 

00:26:27.667 --> 00:26:32.233
bromine, iodine, methyl, ethyl,
isopropyl, t-butyl all 

00:26:32.233 --> 00:26:35.233
can be broken away from these
radicals, and they all should 

00:26:35.233 --> 00:26:38.800
show the same phenomenon, if it
has to do with the stability 

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.767
of the radicals rather than the
starting material. 

00:26:41.767 --> 00:26:45.500
So that's what we're going to do
is expand the scope of what 

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.200
we're looking at using that
table. 

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:54.667
So here is R along here and X.
We're going to break X away 

00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:58.767
from R and leave the R radical.

00:26:58.767 --> 00:26:59.933
Now what connects B? 

00:26:59.933 --> 00:27:02.133
X can be hydrogen, that's this.

00:27:02.133 --> 00:27:05.467
Those are the data we just
looked at, and we explained it 

00:27:05.467 --> 00:27:08.567
in terms of different stability
of the radicals that 

00:27:08.567 --> 00:27:12.400
are being left behind when you
pull the hydrogen away. 

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.333
And here are all the different
alkyls-- 

00:27:16.333 --> 00:27:19.567
methyl, ethyl, isopropyl,
t-butyl. 

00:27:19.567 --> 00:27:21.900
Breaking chlorine away is the
green one, 

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.467
about like the alkyls. 

00:27:23.467 --> 00:27:26.567
Breaking bromine away is the red
one, and iodine. 

00:27:26.567 --> 00:27:30.567
Now what this shows is that
bonds to iodine are much 

00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:33.633
weaker than bonds to hydrogen. 

00:27:33.633 --> 00:27:36.833
Iodine forms weaker bonds than
bromine, than 

00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:38.967
chlorine, than hydrogen. 

00:27:38.967 --> 00:27:40.967
Fine. 

00:27:40.967 --> 00:27:47.000
So hydrogen is stronger than
R-C. R-C is about the same as 

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.367
R-Cl, but R-Cl is stronger than
R-Br, and R-I is the 

00:27:51.367 --> 00:27:54.600
weakest, whatever the radical
you're breaking away. 

00:27:58.133 --> 00:28:02.367
Now there are some obvious
differences here that the 

00:28:02.367 --> 00:28:05.400
phenyl, when phenyl is the group
that's being broken away 

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:09.200
in the left column here, it's
unusually hard to break away. 

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.133
And we saw why that was last
time. 

00:28:11.133 --> 00:28:16.000
They have good overlap because
you have sp2 C-X bonds that 

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.100
have to be broken. 

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.433
They are the strongest-- 

00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:20.433
whatever X you're breaking away
that's 

00:28:20.433 --> 00:28:21.833
the strongest bond. 

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:27.167
And on the far right we see that
if you have allyl and 

00:28:27.167 --> 00:28:30.467
benzyl you get those resonant
stabilized radicals. 

00:28:30.467 --> 00:28:34.800
And no matter what X you're
breaking away that's the best. 

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.567
What we want to do is now focus
on these ones in the 

00:28:37.567 --> 00:28:42.600
middle and see if we can
understand these ones where 

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:46.233
the various methyl, ethyl,
isopropyl and t-butyl are the 

00:28:46.233 --> 00:28:50.433
radicals being left behind, and
see whether the data as a 

00:28:50.433 --> 00:28:54.500
whole echoes what we saw in
hydrogen, that more 

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.833
substituted radicals are more
stable. 

00:28:58.833 --> 00:29:02.733
So all these should be the same.

00:29:02.733 --> 00:29:05.667
That is, it's going to be
different depending on which 

00:29:05.667 --> 00:29:10.300
atom we're pulling away, but the
relative stability of the 

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:13.033
radicals as we go across a given
color should be the 

00:29:13.033 --> 00:29:14.300
same, if that's the explanation.

00:29:17.567 --> 00:29:21.033
So here's when we're breaking H
off. 

00:29:21.033 --> 00:29:22.933
And now I've blown up the scale
so 

00:29:22.933 --> 00:29:24.933
we can see the variation. 

00:29:24.933 --> 00:29:26.367
So we're going to compare it. 

00:29:26.367 --> 00:29:29.300
These are relative bond
dissociation energies, taking 

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.067
zero to be methyl. 

00:29:33.067 --> 00:29:37.533
So we see that it's 4
kilocalories easier to break 

00:29:37.533 --> 00:29:39.567
hydrogen away from ethyl. 

00:29:39.567 --> 00:29:45.333
Another 2 and a fraction to get
isopropyl. 

00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:48.967
And another couple to get
t-butyl. 

00:29:48.967 --> 00:29:53.467
So people do say, your books
I'll guarantee you will say, 

00:29:53.467 --> 00:29:54.933
that those radicals as they're
more 

00:29:54.933 --> 00:29:58.500
substituted are more stable. 

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:01.567
But if it's true, it should be
the same whenever we're 

00:30:01.567 --> 00:30:05.167
breaking away from the radicals.

00:30:05.167 --> 00:30:08.433
So what they tend to say, for
example, the Jones and 

00:30:08.433 --> 00:30:12.833
Flemming book that I mentioned,
on page 479, sp2 

00:30:12.833 --> 00:30:15.667
s bonds to carbon are
preferentially stabilized the 

00:30:15.667 --> 00:30:18.467
more substituted radicals. 

00:30:18.467 --> 00:30:21.467
The C-C overlap is more
sensitive to hybridization 

00:30:21.467 --> 00:30:23.733
than C-H. That's what I just
told you. 

00:30:23.733 --> 00:30:29.467
And they also say on page
478-479, there's probably a 

00:30:29.467 --> 00:30:33.367
bit of stabilization from SOMO
overlap with s and 

00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:34.233
s*. 

00:30:34.233 --> 00:30:35.467
That's what I said last time. 

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.067
Now let's see. 

00:30:40.067 --> 00:30:43.167
So if this trend is due to
radical stabilization by these 

00:30:43.167 --> 00:30:47.467
two phenomena, then whatever X
we break off we should show 

00:30:47.467 --> 00:30:49.033
the same trend. 

00:30:49.033 --> 00:30:51.000
So here's when 
we break t-butyl,

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:58.767
when we break t-butyl away from
the various radicals.

00:30:58.767 --> 00:31:01.533
That is, break the bond between
t-butyl and methyl, 

00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:04.567
between t-butyl and ethyl,
between t-butyl and isopropyl, 

00:31:04.567 --> 00:31:06.267
or between two t-butyls. 

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:09.100
And indeed it looks pretty much
the same. 

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:12.367
Within the error probably, these
are the same trend. 

00:31:12.367 --> 00:31:15.033
So that looks good. 

00:31:15.033 --> 00:31:17.867
But look at the others. 

00:31:17.867 --> 00:31:20.900
If you break these others off
they don't show-- 

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.933
they show it's always going
down, but not nearly as 

00:31:24.933 --> 00:31:26.500
dramatically. 

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.867
So it can't be just the
difference in stability of 

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:32.267
methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and
t-butyl. 

00:31:32.267 --> 00:31:35.633
There has to be something in the
starting material that's 

00:31:35.633 --> 00:31:36.567
contributing to this. 

00:31:36.567 --> 00:31:39.067
It makes a difference what it is
you're breaking away. 

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:50.167
Now, t-butyl is a very special
compound 

00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:52.733
because it's so crowded. 

00:31:52.733 --> 00:31:57.300
So if you put two t-butyls
together, it's very crowded. 

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:00.667
And that could make the starting
material unstable and 

00:32:00.667 --> 00:32:03.867
relatively easy to break the
bond. 

00:32:03.867 --> 00:32:07.167
But we can calculate how much
unstability there is due to 

00:32:07.167 --> 00:32:11.900
that by using molecular
mechanics, as we mentioned at 

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.500
the end last semester. 

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:16.133
So we can calculate strain
energy in the starting 

00:32:16.133 --> 00:32:19.133
material using molecular
mechanics. 

00:32:19.133 --> 00:32:22.367
This is the amount of strain
energy you count in two 

00:32:22.367 --> 00:32:25.967
t-butyls (t-butyl-t-butyl),
t-butyl, in t-butyl with 

00:32:25.967 --> 00:32:28.900
isopropyl, in t-butyl with
ethyl, and in 

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.267
t-butyl with methyl. 

00:32:30.267 --> 00:32:31.900
That's how much strain energy
there is in 

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.100
the starting material. 

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.400
Let's just look at the one there
to see 

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.133
where it comes from. 

00:32:39.133 --> 00:32:43.967
So here are two t-butyls bonded
to one another with 

00:32:43.967 --> 00:32:47.633
idealized bond lengths and
angles. 

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:50.800
And we calculate by molecular
mechanics, if we have normal 

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.533
C-C and C-H bond distances,
normal angles at carbons, how 

00:32:55.533 --> 00:32:58.333
much strain will there be due to
things 

00:32:58.333 --> 00:32:59.933
running into one another. 

00:32:59.933 --> 00:33:02.867
Because you'll notice if you
make a space-filling model of 

00:33:02.867 --> 00:33:08.800
that you can see down the middle
its crunch region. 

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.167
Now how big is that? 

00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:13.467
The van der Waals energy
calculated for this from these 

00:33:13.467 --> 00:33:17.700
things running together is 26.9
kilocalories per mole-- 

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.233
pretty high. 

00:33:19.233 --> 00:33:23.133
Now, of course, the molecule
doesn't have that shape. 

00:33:23.133 --> 00:33:25.733
It adjusts, as we mentioned last
semester, to 

00:33:25.733 --> 00:33:28.833
minimize the energy. 

00:33:28.833 --> 00:33:35.833
So what it does is adjust to
that position. 

00:33:35.833 --> 00:33:42.667
So it drops the van der Waals
energy by 16.8 kilocalories 

00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:45.967
per mole, down to only 5.2. 

00:33:45.967 --> 00:33:49.367
That's how it does it, by moving
the two apart. 

00:33:49.367 --> 00:33:53.500
But it's at the expense of
stretching the bonds and 

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.300
bending the bonds a little bit
to get those hydrogens apart 

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.567
from one another. 

00:33:57.567 --> 00:34:02.067
So although it started with 109
degree bond angles at 1.52 

00:34:02.067 --> 00:34:06.033
angstroms, it changed like
this-- you can see how it 

00:34:06.033 --> 00:34:09.167
moved to get the hydrogens
apart, but there's 

00:34:09.167 --> 00:34:10.667
an expense to pay. 

00:34:10.667 --> 00:34:15.467
So even though we've gotten down
to only 5.2 kilocalories 

00:34:15.467 --> 00:34:20.167
per mole of van der Waals
strain, there's now an 

00:34:20.167 --> 00:34:23.467
increase to 4.8 kilocalories per
mole from 

00:34:23.467 --> 00:34:25.167
stretching and bending. 

00:34:25.167 --> 00:34:29.367
So the total strain in two
t-butyls 

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:32.033
bonded together is 12.2-- 

00:34:32.033 --> 00:34:37.133
that is 4.8 plus 5.2 plus 2.2 of
torsional 

00:34:37.133 --> 00:34:39.500
energy that's in there. 

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:41.867
So that's where that number
comes from. 

00:34:41.867 --> 00:34:44.933
So that's the 12.2, and you can
do similar calculations to 

00:34:44.933 --> 00:34:46.533
get these other values. 

00:34:46.533 --> 00:34:48.133
Now notice something
interesting. 

00:34:48.133 --> 00:34:52.700
Those are strained in the
starting material. 

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:59.967
But notice that the range of
that from 2.3 to 12.2 is 9.9. 

00:34:59.967 --> 00:35:03.833
So that's bigger, in fact, than
the whole range of this 

00:35:03.833 --> 00:35:07.067
difference attributed to
differences in the radicals. 

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:13.100
That is, in the case of t-butyl
the starting material 

00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:17.800
for t-butyl-t-butyl is
strained enough to explain the 

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.167
entire difference of why it's
easy to break 

00:35:20.167 --> 00:35:21.833
t-butyl-t-butyl-- 

00:35:21.833 --> 00:35:26.000
not the radicals but the
starting material. 

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.933
Now we can look at the case of
methyl, how much strain was 

00:35:28.933 --> 00:35:32.233
there in the starting material
when methyl is attached to 

00:35:32.233 --> 00:35:35.267
these various Rs. 

00:35:35.267 --> 00:35:38.067
And what you see is the same
thing, that the amount of 

00:35:38.067 --> 00:35:41.433
strain can explain the range of
difference in bond 

00:35:41.433 --> 00:35:44.300
association energies without say
the radicals are 

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.467
different at all. 

00:35:47.833 --> 00:35:54.567
So for X equals alkyl, methyl,
ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, for 

00:35:54.567 --> 00:35:57.700
the X that's breaking away being
methyl, ethyl, isopropyl 

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.833
or t-butyl, almost all of the
change is due to strain energy 

00:36:01.833 --> 00:36:04.467
in the starting material. 

00:36:04.467 --> 00:36:08.567
But not in the case of H-R,
because in the case of H-R 

00:36:08.567 --> 00:36:12.367
there's very little strain in
the starting material. 

00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:14.300
So there's something different
going on with 

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:15.933
H-R. It's not typical. 

00:36:18.667 --> 00:36:22.600
So as far as I know, no one
really understands this, why 

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.467
it is that way. 

00:36:24.467 --> 00:36:28.400
Now here we've done another plot
where we correct for the 

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.067
R-X strain. 

00:36:30.067 --> 00:36:32.500
That is, subtract out that
strain in the starting 

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:34.900
material and then see how
different they would be. 

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:37.167
And you see there's hardly any
difference at all as you go 

00:36:37.167 --> 00:36:39.367
from methyl, ethyl, isopropyl,
t-butyl radicals. 

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:45.933
So this is an alternative to the
hypothesis that radical 

00:36:45.933 --> 00:36:50.133
stabilization by substitution of
methyls for hydrogens-- 

00:36:50.133 --> 00:36:53.400
more substituted radicals are
more stable, which I guarantee 

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.700
you is what your books will say,
whatever book you're 

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:57.567
looking at. 

00:36:57.567 --> 00:37:00.967
So the intrinsic C-C bond
strength corrected for strain 

00:37:00.967 --> 00:37:02.833
is practically insensitive to
the 

00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:04.533
substitution of the radicals. 

00:37:04.533 --> 00:37:09.067
But if you have C-H bonds they
are, indeed, weakened by 

00:37:09.067 --> 00:37:14.000
alkylation of the carbon, but no
one understands it. 

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.633
On the other hand, if you have
chlorines-- 

00:37:16.633 --> 00:37:18.967
chlorine or bromine, they go the
other way. 

00:37:18.967 --> 00:37:21.200
And again, nobody understands
it. 

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.900
No one I know at least
understands this, but the 

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.000
textbooks seem to be wrong. 

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.567
So a word to the wise as you
look at 

00:37:28.567 --> 00:37:29.800
your different textbooks. 

00:37:31.933 --> 00:37:34.467
Now that's what we're going to
say about bond energies. 

00:37:34.467 --> 00:37:38.133
Now how can we predict
activation energies. When 

00:37:38.133 --> 00:37:41.633
you're not just breaking a bond,
but making a new bond as 

00:37:41.633 --> 00:37:43.700
you break the old bond? 

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.867
What energy should that have? 

00:37:45.867 --> 00:37:49.333
Can we use the energies of
stable structures, ones that 

00:37:49.333 --> 00:37:52.233
we understand to the extent we--

00:37:52.233 --> 00:37:54.633
it's clear that we don't really
understand things 

00:37:54.633 --> 00:37:55.967
perfectly-- 

00:37:55.967 --> 00:37:59.533
can we infer the energies of
transition states so we're 

00:37:59.533 --> 00:38:02.267
able to predict reactivity? 

00:38:02.267 --> 00:38:06.700
For example, might exothermic
reactions be faster than 

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.933
endothermic ones? 

00:38:09.933 --> 00:38:11.200
Now let me take this-- 

00:38:13.533 --> 00:38:15.933
someplace I dropped my prop. 

00:38:15.933 --> 00:38:17.300
Is there a green thing over
there? 

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.200
OK, you'll have to imagine my
green thing that I thought I 

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.700
brought along. 

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:29.833
I had a packing strip that comes
around big shipments. 

00:38:29.833 --> 00:38:32.733
So it's a piece of wire. 

00:38:32.733 --> 00:38:35.633
So imagine that there's a wire
between my two hands and I'm 

00:38:35.633 --> 00:38:37.267
holding it so that it goes like
this. 

00:38:39.967 --> 00:38:43.167
So it's like a reaction
coordinate. 

00:38:43.167 --> 00:38:46.900
What I'm showing you is an
endothermic reaction. 

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:49.433
You start here, you go over a
barrier, 

00:38:49.433 --> 00:38:51.800
then you get to product. 

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:58.500
Or if I lower the product, it
now looks like this. 

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.967
You have that in your mind's
eye? 

00:39:01.967 --> 00:39:04.833
So I can go back and forth,
knowing the energy difference 

00:39:04.833 --> 00:39:08.467
between starting material and
product, I have some idea what 

00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:11.067
the activation energy might look
like. 

00:39:11.067 --> 00:39:12.967
Of course, this is really
nonsense. 

00:39:12.967 --> 00:39:18.367
Activation energy isn't a
packing strip like that, but 

00:39:18.367 --> 00:39:21.033
we can think of it that way. 

00:39:21.033 --> 00:39:24.767
And if that were so, then you
notice that an endothermic 

00:39:24.767 --> 00:39:28.867
reaction would have a high
transition state. 

00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:31.033
But an exothermic reaction would
have a 

00:39:31.033 --> 00:39:33.633
low transition state. 

00:39:33.633 --> 00:39:35.900
So we could go from a knowledge
of the starting 

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.367
material and the products to
infer something about what the 

00:39:39.367 --> 00:39:43.900
activation energy was, as long
as we're looking at reactions 

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.433
that are very, very similar to
one another. 

00:39:46.433 --> 00:39:48.333
So they would have the same kind
of strip. 

00:39:51.167 --> 00:39:54.400
So we're going to see if we can
use that to understand 

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.200
something, to predict things,
about free- 

00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.200
radical make and break. 

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:07.500
So we're not going to try to do
absolute 

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.867
energies like this-- 

00:40:08.867 --> 00:40:12.333
that's way too hard. 

00:40:12.333 --> 00:40:15.733
But we'll hope we can at least
do relative energies if we 

00:40:15.733 --> 00:40:19.800
look at analogous reactions. 

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.233
So how can we predict activation
energy? 

00:40:22.233 --> 00:40:25.767
It's no easy task a priori,
especially when interaction 

00:40:25.767 --> 00:40:28.400
with the solvent is important. 

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.733
But often you can say something
sensible about 

00:40:30.733 --> 00:40:34.967
relative values of the
activation energy or the free 

00:40:34.967 --> 00:40:37.267
energy of activation. 

00:40:37.267 --> 00:40:40.400
It's a question of compared to
what-- you want to compare two 

00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:44.233
things that are very close to
one another. 

00:40:44.233 --> 00:40:47.800
Now this is related to what's
called the Hammond Postulate. 

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.167
George Hammond, who incidentally
was also a 

00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:54.833
student of Professor Bartlett
who's your chemical 

00:40:54.833 --> 00:40:57.867
grandfather as we talked about
last time-- 

00:40:57.867 --> 00:41:02.467
in 1955 formulated something
that has become called the 

00:41:02.467 --> 00:41:04.767
Hammond Postulate. 

00:41:04.767 --> 00:41:08.267
What he actually said was, If
two states, for example, a 

00:41:08.267 --> 00:41:11.967
transition state and an unstable
intermediate, occur 

00:41:11.967 --> 00:41:15.167
consecutively during a reaction
process and have 

00:41:15.167 --> 00:41:18.400
nearly the same energy content,
there interconversion 

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.067
will involve only a small
reorganization of molecular 

00:41:22.067 --> 00:41:23.167
structures. 

00:41:23.167 --> 00:41:24.867
I found my prop here. 

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:34.233
So here's an exothermic
reaction. 

00:41:34.233 --> 00:41:37.700
Here's an endothermic reaction.

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.033
Now notice that the transition
state and the product are very 

00:41:41.033 --> 00:41:44.500
near one another in energy in
this case. 

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.800
But they're also near one
another in structure, from 

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.700
here to here. 

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.700
Whereas if it were an exothermic
reaction, the 

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.733
transition state is very
different from the product, 

00:41:57.733 --> 00:42:00.333
it's like the starting material,
and it's very near 

00:42:00.333 --> 00:42:04.767
in structure to the starting
material. 

00:42:04.767 --> 00:42:09.367
It's a little bit crummy, but I
think you got the idea. 

00:42:09.367 --> 00:42:13.267
So whether that's what you would
read into this 

00:42:13.267 --> 00:42:15.633
necessarily. I don't know. 

00:42:15.633 --> 00:42:20.633
But what is clear is that this
stimulated organic chemists to 

00:42:20.633 --> 00:42:23.633
begin thinking about transition
states and to try 

00:42:23.633 --> 00:42:29.333
to generalize plausibly about
reaction coordinates-- 

00:42:29.333 --> 00:42:32.233
how you might infer from
starting material and product 

00:42:32.233 --> 00:42:35.200
energies, the kind of molecules
we know about, to 

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.867
these transition states. When
one bond is being made and 

00:42:37.867 --> 00:42:41.767
another broken, for example,
which is very difficult to 

00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:44.467
reason about. 

00:42:44.467 --> 00:42:47.200
So here's another picture of the
same thing. 

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.633
The more exothermic a reaction
the more similar the 

00:42:50.633 --> 00:42:53.567
transition state to the starting
material, both in 

00:42:53.567 --> 00:42:55.200
energy and in structure. 

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:57.067
So here's the starting material,
here's the 

00:42:57.067 --> 00:42:58.133
transition state. 

00:42:58.133 --> 00:43:02.367
When it's very exothermic it's
close to the starting material 

00:43:02.367 --> 00:43:03.567
in energy, it's close to the 

00:43:03.567 --> 00:43:04.833
starting material in structure.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.467
If it's not very exothermic,
then the transition state is 

00:43:13.467 --> 00:43:16.900
sort of halfway along, and
considerably above the 

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:20.133
starting material in energy. 

00:43:20.133 --> 00:43:25.467
And if it's endothermic it's
near the product in energy and 

00:43:25.467 --> 00:43:32.467
in structure, so that the
reaction is then-- 

00:43:32.467 --> 00:43:36.033
and the reaction is slow because
the transition state 

00:43:36.033 --> 00:43:38.967
is so much higher. 

00:43:38.967 --> 00:43:43.467
Now we can be fairly confident
of this, at least if we're 

00:43:43.467 --> 00:43:46.100
looking at very similar
reactions. 

00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:48.633
For example, the ones were
talking about. 

00:43:48.633 --> 00:43:53.100
If you have an X radical come up
and take H away from R, but 

00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:58.733
we vary X or we vary R to make
the reaction more or less 

00:43:58.733 --> 00:44:04.433
exothermic, then we might be
able to use this kind of 

00:44:04.433 --> 00:44:07.633
reasoning to get from one to
another. 

00:44:07.633 --> 00:44:10.067
Knowing one we can predict
another. 

00:44:10.067 --> 00:44:14.867
Now there's likely a continuum
between starting material and 

00:44:14.867 --> 00:44:16.700
product with respect to factors

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.500
that influence stability. 

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.033
For example, resonance
stabilization. 

00:44:21.033 --> 00:44:24.967
Remember the allyl radical and
the benzyl radical are 

00:44:24.967 --> 00:44:29.133
especially stable because they
have resonance stabilization, 

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:33.667
the SOMO mixing with pi and
pi*. 

00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:38.800
So if we're talking relative to
just a regular old alkyl 

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:42.633
group, methyl, so we got here
methane 

00:44:42.633 --> 00:44:44.167
goes to methyl radical. 

00:44:44.167 --> 00:44:47.700
So we make those, by definition,
the same, because 

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:49.667
we're going to compare relative.

00:44:49.667 --> 00:44:54.267
What happens if we have benzyl
with hydrogen on it and the 

00:44:54.267 --> 00:44:55.567
benzyl radical. 

00:44:55.567 --> 00:44:58.567
And we see that the benzyl
radical is more stable because 

00:44:58.567 --> 00:45:04.433
when you get here you have this
resonance stabilization. 

00:45:04.433 --> 00:45:09.000
And this idea that there's a
continuum is that the further 

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.167
the transition state is along,
the more it will experience 

00:45:13.167 --> 00:45:14.433
that special stabilization. 

00:45:17.467 --> 00:45:20.467
So if the transition state, when
this bond is partly 

00:45:20.467 --> 00:45:24.567
broken because X is taking H
away, if it were a late 

00:45:24.567 --> 00:45:30.133
transition state like that, an
endothermic process, then it 

00:45:30.133 --> 00:45:31.567
should have a late-- 

00:45:31.567 --> 00:45:33.967
if it were a late transition
state it should have pretty 

00:45:33.967 --> 00:45:37.000
much stabilization by resonance.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.333
But if it's an exothermic
reaction and it's a very early 

00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:44.533
transition state, then it
shouldn't have much of this. 

00:45:44.533 --> 00:45:47.567
So the idea is that you're going
to have a steady 

00:45:47.567 --> 00:45:48.567
increase of this. 

00:45:48.567 --> 00:45:51.100
It might not be quite a straight
line, but at least 

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.500
it's steadily going down. 

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.667
So the rate of the slower
reaction should be more 

00:45:59.667 --> 00:46:05.700
sensitive to the overall
difference in free energy. 

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.033
That is, if you have a very fast
reaction and you move 

00:46:09.033 --> 00:46:12.700
this up and down, change the
exothermicity, delta G, by 

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:16.433
quite a bit, you hardly move
that at all. 

00:46:16.433 --> 00:46:19.200
But if it's an endothermic
reaction and you move this up 

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:23.067
and down, this'll move up and
down almost as much. 

00:46:23.067 --> 00:46:28.067
So the reaction becomes less
sensitive to the delta G when 

00:46:28.067 --> 00:46:31.567
you have an exothermic reaction
because it happens so 

00:46:31.567 --> 00:46:34.200
near the starting material. 

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.167
So this gives rise to what's
called the 

00:46:36.167 --> 00:46:40.067
Reactivity-Selectivity
Principle. 

00:46:40.067 --> 00:46:42.633
So here's an exothermic
reaction, here's an 

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:44.400
endothermic reaction. 

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:48.400
It could be pulling H off of
certain R by 

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.900
chlorine or by bromine. 

00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:53.133
So it could look like this. 

00:46:53.133 --> 00:46:55.600
So this would be more reactive
and that 

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.633
would be less reactive. 

00:46:57.633 --> 00:46:59.367
Higher activation energy. 

00:46:59.367 --> 00:47:02.933
But consider a similar pair of
reactions where you're pulling 

00:47:02.933 --> 00:47:06.900
the H away from a different R,
an R whose bond 

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:10.033
is easier to break. 

00:47:10.033 --> 00:47:13.900
So the radical here is more
stable, at least compared to 

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.267
the starting material-- it may,
in fact, be the starting 

00:47:16.267 --> 00:47:19.600
materials that are different as
we were talking about. 

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:21.900
So you have a certain difference
here, it's the same 

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.100
difference here-- you're going
from the same starting 

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:27.733
material to the same radical,
it's just that in this case 

00:47:27.733 --> 00:47:30.000
you're using bromine to pull it
off, in this case you're 

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.100
using chlorine. 

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:35.833
So notice that in this stage
it's not selective because no 

00:47:35.833 --> 00:47:40.567
matter which of the compounds,
the blue RH or the red RH, no 

00:47:40.567 --> 00:47:43.500
matter which H you're pulling
off with the chlorine, they 

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:46.200
have almost exactly the same
energy-- 

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.400
activation energy, the same
rate. 

00:47:49.400 --> 00:47:51.867
But here in the case of bromine
it's going to be more 

00:47:51.867 --> 00:47:57.133
selective because you're going
to have a bigger difference 

00:47:57.133 --> 00:47:59.133
because it's further along. 

00:47:59.133 --> 00:48:03.133
And I'll stop now and we'll pick
up here next time on this 

00:48:03.133 --> 00:48:06.067
Reactivity-Selectivity
Principle-- 

00:48:06.067 --> 00:48:10.267
the idea that the less reactive
it is the more 

00:48:10.267 --> 00:48:12.100
selective it will be. 

00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:13.367
Thanks.

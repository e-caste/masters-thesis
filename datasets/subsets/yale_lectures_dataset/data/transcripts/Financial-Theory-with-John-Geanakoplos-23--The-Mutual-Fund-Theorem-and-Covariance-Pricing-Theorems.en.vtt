00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.990
Prof: Okay,
I think I should begin.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.552
So we're at the point in the
course now where we're talking

00:00:11.552 --> 00:00:15.957
about the Capital Asset Pricing
Model and the economists'

00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:20.440
understanding of risk aversion
and its consequence for the

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.250
financial sector.
 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.102
So much of what economists know
was already known to

00:00:27.102 --> 00:00:30.177
businessmen,
because it's common sense,

00:00:30.177 --> 00:00:33.220
and even to literary writers
like Shakespeare,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.440
who was himself quite a
successful businessman.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.768
So you might remember that
Shakespeare already had the idea

00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:45.060
of diversification.
 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.769
In the Merchant of Venice,
Antonio says "Each boat on

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.830
a different ocean."
 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.528
He said it a bit more
poetically than that,

00:00:57.528 --> 00:01:01.320
"each sail on a different
argosy" or something.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.353
I've forgotten what it was,
but each boat on a different

00:01:03.353 --> 00:01:03.649
ocean.
 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.299
So he wasn't very worried
because he was diversified.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.090
He also had the idea of risk
and return.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.150
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.750
Nothing ventured,
so ventured means risk.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.010
Nothing gained.
 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:35.062
So another way of saying this
diversification is "Don't

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:41.200
put all your eggs in one
basket."

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.688
So what have economists done
that wasn't already known to

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:50.260
every business person and every
clever literary writer?

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.796
Well, economists have
quantified this and turned this

00:01:53.796 --> 00:01:56.720
into a usable,
practical piece of advice.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.600
So the diversification theorem
in CAPM-- so I should have moved

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.040
CAPM.
 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.180
I should have called this
Shakespeare and this CAPM.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:15.438
CAPM becomes the mutual fund
theorem.

00:02:15.438 --> 00:02:18.590
So the mutual fund theorem has
very practical advice.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.399
It says if you're investing in
the stock market,

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.908
don't try to pick out
individual stocks.

00:02:23.908 --> 00:02:29.740
Hold every stock in proportion
to its value in the whole

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:30.800
economy.
 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.021
If you want to be more
venturesome, don't pick riskier

00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:34.568
stocks.
 

00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:37.568
Just simply leave less money in
the bank.

00:02:37.568 --> 00:02:44.848
So divide all your money
between the index and the bank.

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:48.626
It says, hold all your money in
stocks in the same proportion

00:02:48.626 --> 00:02:50.639
everyone else is holding them.
 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.120
Hold the market, in other words.
 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.049
Hold an index like the S&amp;P
500, of all the stocks,

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.038
in proportion to how big they
are.

00:02:57.038 --> 00:03:00.598
And if you want to get more
venturesome--if you're cautious,

00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:03.977
put some of your money in the
index and some of it in the

00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:04.520
bank.
 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.594
If you want to be more
venturesome, take some money out

00:03:07.594 --> 00:03:09.930
of the bank and put it into the
stocks.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.240
But in the index.
 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.551
If you want to be even more
venturesome than that,

00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:16.289
borrow the money to put the
money into the stock market.

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:17.568
That's called leverage.
 

00:03:17.568 --> 00:03:20.449
But you should,
according to this theory,

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.250
not try to pick stocks.
 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.997
So if you're interested in
risk, you shouldn't pick high

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.110
technology startup companies.
 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.518
You should pick the same
mixture of blue chip companies

00:03:31.518 --> 00:03:35.494
like General Electric and these
startup companies that everybody

00:03:35.494 --> 00:03:36.818
else is choosing.
 

00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:38.378
So that's what it means to
diversify.

00:03:38.378 --> 00:03:41.264
Hold a little bit of everything
in the same proportion as

00:03:41.264 --> 00:03:42.090
everyone else.
 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.687
So it's much more precise,
much more surprising than

00:03:45.687 --> 00:03:47.310
Shakespeare's advice.
 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.780
Then the second thing,
risk and reward,

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.128
it says that the price of a
security,

00:03:56.128 --> 00:04:00.199
so we'll call it pi_J
say,

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.688
which we used to think of as
the expectation--

00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:04.419
of course, you need the
probabilities--

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:08.270
of the payoff of the security
J, discounted.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.430
That's what we would have
thought the price was.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:19.259
So this is called the
covariance pricing theorem.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.535
The shocking thing is,
it's not the expectation

00:04:22.535 --> 00:04:26.310
discounted, which is what we
thought it was before.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.915
We know that you have to adjust
for risk somehow,

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:31.360
which we haven't taken into
account before.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.151
But what's so shocking is,
you might have thought you'd

00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:39.295
subtract maybe something times
the variance of the return of

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:41.810
asset J,
but that's not going to be the

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:42.129
case.
 

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:45.045
It's going to be,
surprisingly,

00:04:45.045 --> 00:04:50.781
subtracting something times the
covariance, with the market,

00:04:50.781 --> 00:04:52.240
of asset J.
 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.555
So you penalize--the price of a
stock should go lower if it gets

00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:57.240
riskier.
 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.004
Its risk is not defined by what
its variance is,

00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:02.829
but by what its covariance is
with the market.

00:05:02.829 --> 00:05:06.528
So I want to develop these two
ideas in this lecture,

00:05:06.528 --> 00:05:09.879
spend the whole lecture on just
developing these two ideas,

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.545
which are the modern
mathematical version of what

00:05:12.545 --> 00:05:14.879
Shakespeare already knew 400
years ago,

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.480
but made much more concrete,
much more precise,

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.930
with the mathematics wholly
behind them.

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.819
So what have we got here?
 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:28.425
We imagine a world,
the situation I'm going to

00:05:28.425 --> 00:05:32.014
describe, is the one we had last
time, where we know that there

00:05:32.014 --> 00:05:34.389
are different things that can
happen.

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:40.014
These are the states with
different probabilities,

00:05:40.014 --> 00:05:42.310
so there's states.
 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.826
s = 1 to big S and each of them
have probabilities,

00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:53.910
with probabilities
gamma_s.

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.589
Of course, the sum of the
gamma_s = 1.

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.084
So everybody knows the
probabilities of the states and

00:06:00.084 --> 00:06:02.910
then they know what the payoff
is of the different assets.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.100
So here's A^(1), here's A^(2),
here's A^(J) say,

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.838
and they know what the payoffs
are going to be,

00:06:09.838 --> 00:06:12.459
A^(1) in state 1,
A^(1) in state 2,

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:15.939
A^(1) in state S,
A^(2) in state 1,

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:19.129
A^(2) in state S,
A^(J) in state 1,

00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:21.759
A^(J) in state 2,
A^(J) in state S.

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:25.401
So given these probabilities
and given the payoffs,

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.899
you can compute the expectation
of each thing.

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:33.589
You can compute the expectation
of A^(J), say.

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:38.646
It's just the summation from s
= 1 to S of gamma_s

00:06:38.646 --> 00:06:40.360
A^(J)_s.
 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.540
You can also compute the
variance, so I'll write that

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:46.550
sometimes as A bar^(J).
 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.690
You can compute the variance of
A^(J),

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.360
which is the summation,
s = 1 to S,

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:00.677
remember, of gamma_s
A^(J)_s - A bar^(j)

00:07:00.677 --> 00:07:01.750
squared.
 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.930
Okay, and you could also
compute the covariance of any 2,

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:13.050
A^(J) and A^(K) as summation
gamma_s

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:20.942
A^(J)_s - A bar^(J)
times (this is s = 1 to S) of

00:07:20.942 --> 00:07:25.839
A^(K)_s - A bar^(K) K.
 

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:28.689
So those three numbers,
the expectation,

00:07:28.689 --> 00:07:31.819
the variance and the covariance
between any pairs,

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:34.040
those are numbers that anybody
could compute,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.399
knowing the payoffs of the
assets and knowing the

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:38.519
probabilities.
 

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:40.899
And what the theory is going to
say,

00:07:40.899 --> 00:07:44.680
the capital asset pricing
model, that model is going to

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.529
explain how the prices of all
the assets depend on their

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:51.007
expectation,
their variances and their

00:07:51.007 --> 00:07:53.084
covariances,
under the assumption that

00:07:53.084 --> 00:07:59.557
people have quadratic utilities,
or more generally,

00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:10.100
assume people only care about
the mean--

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:20.699
that's the expectation--and
variance of final consumption.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:22.870
So we wrote that last time.
 

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.860
We said if you had quadratic
utility for consumption in every

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.120
state,
you could summarize these

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.105
thousands--
there could be millions of

00:08:30.105 --> 00:08:31.649
states and thousands of
securities.

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:33.889
You add them all together,
what you hold,

00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:37.024
it only depends on the end
about what the expectation and

00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:39.490
the variance of your final
portfolio is.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.009
You like expectation and you
hate variance.

00:08:42.009 --> 00:08:44.404
So under that hypothesis,
we're going to have a very

00:08:44.404 --> 00:08:47.221
concrete interpretation of what
Shakespeare was talking about

00:08:47.221 --> 00:08:50.163
from the beginning,
which is going to allow us to

00:08:50.163 --> 00:08:53.624
quantify what you should do,
how people in the market are

00:08:53.624 --> 00:08:54.019
doing.
 

00:08:54.019 --> 00:08:58.000
We'll be able to answer a
series of questions.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.100
And then we'll be able to test
the theory too.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:06.428
So now the theory I'm about to
explain was developed in 1950.

00:09:06.428 --> 00:09:10.220
It began in 1950 when Koopmans
was a professor at the Cowles

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:13.369
Foundation, the director of the
Cowles Foundation,

00:09:13.369 --> 00:09:14.590
was in Chicago.
 

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:18.259
I told you, the Cowles
Foundation was started by Alfred

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:19.765
Cowles,
who'd been a Yale

00:09:19.765 --> 00:09:21.613
undergraduate,
and his family owned the

00:09:21.613 --> 00:09:24.528
Chicago Tribune and a
bunch of other newspapers.

00:09:24.528 --> 00:09:28.592
And he ran a macroeconomic
forecasting company in 1929,

00:09:28.592 --> 00:09:30.399
right after the crash.
 

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:34.395
He was embarrassed to realize
that he had predicted that

00:09:34.395 --> 00:09:37.721
everything was going to be fine,
and he sent around

00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:39.590
questionnaires and read
everybody else's,

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:42.581
his competitors' newspapers,
and realized they'd been

00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:45.460
predicting everything was going
to be fine too,

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.370
except for one guy,
Jones, the Dow Jones guy.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:53.655
Except for that,
everybody had been making the

00:09:53.655 --> 00:09:55.408
same rosy predictions.
 

00:09:55.408 --> 00:09:58.750
So he decided the whole subject
of economic forecasting,

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.168
in fact, economics altogether
was a fraud,

00:10:01.168 --> 00:10:04.475
and he wanted to put money in
encouraging the use of

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:08.548
mathematics in economics,
instead of the touchy-feely

00:10:08.548 --> 00:10:13.320
more qualitative analysis that
was the norm at the time.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.187
So he went to see Irving
Fisher, who was the great Yale

00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:18.895
economist, and said,
"What should I do with all

00:10:18.895 --> 00:10:19.639
the money?
 

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.950
Where should I put this
institute, and who should I

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.428
invite to the institute?"
 

00:10:23.428 --> 00:10:26.663
So Fisher and he set up the
whole thing and it started in

00:10:26.663 --> 00:10:29.393
Colorado Springs,
because Fisher believed in

00:10:29.393 --> 00:10:31.335
fresh air,
and he wrote a lot of books

00:10:31.335 --> 00:10:33.720
about fresh air and how it
staved off tuberculosis and

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.620
things like that.
 

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.803
And no one wanted to go to
Colorado Springs,

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:42.096
so they moved it to Chicago
where the family was originally

00:10:42.096 --> 00:10:44.168
from, the Cowles family.
 

00:10:44.168 --> 00:10:47.418
The director then in the '50s
was someone named Koopmans,

00:10:47.418 --> 00:10:51.921
and Koopmans had this idea of
trying to examine risk by making

00:10:51.921 --> 00:10:54.428
people with quadratic utilities.
 

00:10:54.428 --> 00:10:56.806
And he said,
"Okay, student Markowitz,

00:10:56.806 --> 00:10:59.408
why don't you try to develop a
theory?"

00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:03.222
And Markowitz began the theory
of the capital asset pricing

00:11:03.222 --> 00:11:03.750
model.
 

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.695
Now the theory,
just to get a little ahead of

00:11:05.695 --> 00:11:08.019
the story,
Markowitz went quite a ways,

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:11.330
won a Nobel prize many years
later for what he did,

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:13.250
but didn't quite get to the end.
 

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:16.320
And while he was working on it,
Koopmans didn't want to be

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:19.091
director any more of Cowles,
and he invited Tobin,

00:11:19.091 --> 00:11:22.666
the great Yale economist,
to come and be director of

00:11:22.666 --> 00:11:23.330
Cowles.
 

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.899
And Tobin got there and the
people at the University of

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:28.326
Chicago said to Tobin,
"Well, we're glad you're

00:11:28.326 --> 00:11:28.850
coming.
 

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.278
You'll be right next to us,
but don't try and get us mixed

00:11:31.278 --> 00:11:34.049
up with all those mathematical
people at the Cowles Foundation.

00:11:34.049 --> 00:11:35.250
They're all crazy.
 

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.178
We would like to keep that high
tech mathematics out of our

00:11:39.178 --> 00:11:40.058
department.
 

00:11:40.058 --> 00:11:42.440
That's just Cowles' crazy
idea."

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.504
So Tobin refused the job,
came back to Yale,

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:48.639
and Markowitz was so angry--not
Markowitz.

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:50.948
Koopmans, his advisor,
was so angry that he went to

00:11:50.948 --> 00:11:53.028
Cowles and said,
"They're not treating us

00:11:53.028 --> 00:11:54.830
right at the University of
Chicago.

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:57.500
Let's move the entire Cowles
Foundation to Yale."

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.629
So in 1955, they moved it to
Yale.

00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:02.880
But in these conversations
Tobin had with Koopmans and the

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.551
Cowles Foundation,
he got to know what Markowitz

00:12:05.551 --> 00:12:08.596
was doing,
and so he added the final

00:12:08.596 --> 00:12:14.331
crowning achievement to--
the mutual fund theorem--to the

00:12:14.331 --> 00:12:17.836
Markowitz setup,
and he subsequently won the

00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:19.178
Nobel Prize for that.
 

00:12:19.178 --> 00:12:22.542
In fact, the New York
Times said in its

00:12:22.542 --> 00:12:26.120
description of what he won the
Nobel Prize for,

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.493
the New York Times
said, "James Tobin won the

00:12:28.493 --> 00:12:31.029
Nobel prize for showing that you
shouldn't put all your eggs in

00:12:31.029 --> 00:12:31.889
one basket."
 

00:12:31.889 --> 00:12:37.149
So anyway, that's the theory
that I have to explain now,

00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:39.399
that it's a little bit less
trivial than just saying,

00:12:39.399 --> 00:12:41.168
"Don't put all your eggs
in one basket.

00:12:41.168 --> 00:12:45.980
So, the idea is that you like
expectation, you hate variance.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.557
So the first thing we're going
to do is notice that

00:12:49.557 --> 00:12:53.205
covariance--I'm sorry,
standard deviation is defined

00:12:53.205 --> 00:12:55.710
as the square root of variance.
 

00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:58.301
So to say that you don't like
variance means you don't like

00:12:58.301 --> 00:12:59.240
standard deviation.
 

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.279
They're the same thing,
but you're going to see,

00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:02.928
it makes the diagrams much
prettier.

00:13:02.928 --> 00:13:08.282
So if we had a portfolio that
you could choose among some

00:13:08.282 --> 00:13:12.870
combination of putting your
money in the A's,

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.390
you'd get some expectation of
some standard deviation for your

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.428
total portfolio.
 

00:13:17.428 --> 00:13:20.845
And people like more
expectation and like less

00:13:20.845 --> 00:13:22.440
standard deviation.
 

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.080
So the indifference curves are
going in that direction,

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.399
unlike the usual picture.
 

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:30.048
That was the first step.
 

00:13:30.048 --> 00:13:34.017
Now the first thing we noticed
last time, this was three weeks

00:13:34.017 --> 00:13:37.658
ago or so, we made an extremely
important observation.

00:13:37.658 --> 00:13:44.370
We said, what is the covariance
of part of your money in X,

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:48.907
the variance of part of your
money in X and the rest of your

00:13:48.907 --> 00:13:52.711
money--
let's say you have 1 dollar--so

00:13:52.711 --> 00:13:55.220
t in X and (1 - t) in Y?
 

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:58.480
For example,
1 half in X and 1 half in Y.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:04.811
Well that is by definition the
same as the covariance of this

00:14:04.811 --> 00:14:09.902
portfolio with itself,
and now we know this from this

00:14:09.902 --> 00:14:12.245
theorem,
from this definition of

00:14:12.245 --> 00:14:14.595
covariance,
that if you look at the

00:14:14.595 --> 00:14:18.119
covariance of J with K,
so fixing K--this is just

00:14:18.119 --> 00:14:18.730
linear.
 

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:23.341
This is a constant,
multiplying the differences

00:14:23.341 --> 00:14:26.250
from J and its expectation.
 

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.028
So this is a linear in each
variable,

00:14:29.028 --> 00:14:37.123
so therefore this is going to
equal the covariance of tX with

00:14:37.123 --> 00:14:47.928
tX twice the covariance of t--
so the covariance of tX and (1

00:14:47.928 --> 00:14:54.206
- t)Y,
the covariance of (1 - t)Y and

00:14:54.206 --> 00:15:02.389
tX (1 - t) squared (so I'll put
that one over here) the

00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:08.149
covariance of (1 - tY) with
itself.

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:11.173
So I've taken this with this,
then this with that,

00:15:11.173 --> 00:15:14.690
then that with that and that
with the thing on the end.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:18.169
But it's linear again,
so I can pull out all these

00:15:18.169 --> 00:15:18.809
things.
 

00:15:18.809 --> 00:15:20.730
So that's the formula.
 

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:25.410
Now what we noticed is that if
2 stocks, X and Y,

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:29.408
are independent,
their covariance is 0.

00:15:29.408 --> 00:15:31.738
So I'm assuming you remember
that, so those terms just go

00:15:31.738 --> 00:15:32.028
away.
 

00:15:32.028 --> 00:15:36.482
And then it's also linear,
so this is just going to equal

00:15:36.482 --> 00:15:41.491
t squared, covariance of X with
X, which is just the variance of

00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:41.970
X.
 

00:15:41.970 --> 00:15:50.763
So assume XY independent,
then that is what allows me to

00:15:50.763 --> 00:15:56.360
cancel these two terms like
that.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:03.197
So I get t squared times the
covariance of X (1 - t) squared

00:16:03.197 --> 00:16:06.210
times the variance of Y.
 

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:15.402
If I take t = 1 half,
I know that the variance of 1

00:16:15.402 --> 00:16:24.961
half X 1 half Y = 1 quarter
times the variance of X 1

00:16:24.961 --> 00:16:31.580
quarter times the variance of Y.
 

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.200
We derived this three weeks ago.
 

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.460
I'm just repeating it.
 

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.317
So the amazing thing is,
if X and Y have the same

00:16:37.317 --> 00:16:39.519
expectation and the same
variance,

00:16:39.519 --> 00:16:42.400
but are independent of each
other, by splitting your money

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.359
between two independent things,
you're obviously going to have

00:16:45.359 --> 00:16:50.899
the same expectation,
but only half the variance.

00:16:50.899 --> 00:16:54.740
And that last step is,
the variance of X = variance of

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.029
Y.
 

00:16:55.029 --> 00:16:57.183
So amazingly--or it's not so
amazing, I guess,

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.201
if you've thought about it--but
if you haven't thought about it,

00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:01.590
you've got 2 equal risks.
 

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.276
Neither one is better than the
other, so why bother with one

00:17:04.276 --> 00:17:05.369
rather than the other?
 

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:06.220
They're both the same.
 

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.673
But if they're independent,
you should put half your money

00:17:08.673 --> 00:17:09.450
in each of them.
 

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:13.039
You get the same expectation,
but you're going to get only

00:17:13.039 --> 00:17:14.298
half the variance.
 

00:17:14.298 --> 00:17:18.851
So if you have 2 dice,
let's say the first die will

00:17:18.851 --> 00:17:24.311
give you--you pay 100 dollars
for a dice, you can get 100 the

00:17:24.311 --> 00:17:26.769
number of dots showing.
 

00:17:26.769 --> 00:17:29.256
So if it gets a 1 that's 101
dollars, you get a 6,

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:30.220
it's 106 dollars.
 

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:35.125
So if you held 1 dice,
1 die, you'd get on average 103

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:37.068
and 1 half dollars.
 

00:17:37.068 --> 00:17:39.904
You could pay 100,
get 1 die, which on average

00:17:39.904 --> 00:17:41.288
paid 103 and 1 half.
 

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:44.635
Instead, you could put 50
dollars in the first die,

00:17:44.635 --> 00:17:47.713
get half of that,
50 dollars in the second die,

00:17:47.713 --> 00:17:49.118
get half of that.
 

00:17:49.118 --> 00:17:51.911
So on average,
you're still getting 103 and 1

00:17:51.911 --> 00:17:55.718
half, but the variance you get
is going to be half of what it

00:17:55.718 --> 00:17:56.670
was before.
 

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.651
So in this picture,
you start off with X and Y with

00:17:59.651 --> 00:18:02.990
the same standard deviation and
the same expectation,

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:06.317
but they're independent and now
you put half your money in each

00:18:06.317 --> 00:18:08.250
and you cut the variance in
half,

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:11.260
which means you divide--the
standard deviation is the square

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:13.586
root--
so you divide it by the square

00:18:13.586 --> 00:18:14.289
root of 2.
 

00:18:14.289 --> 00:18:15.640
So you've improved.
 

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.960
You've moved to the left.
 

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.881
You've gotten less standard
deviation without constricting

00:18:21.881 --> 00:18:23.670
your expectation at all.
 

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.750
So that's the most important
thing to notice.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:32.588
I'm going to say one more
thing, one more way.

00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:39.247
I'm going to go back to this
formula, which is where the

00:18:39.247 --> 00:18:41.788
variance was,
here.

00:18:41.788 --> 00:18:54.338
Now suppose--let's look at that
formula.

00:18:54.338 --> 00:18:59.148
Suppose I take 2 stocks,
which I'm going to switch now,

00:18:59.148 --> 00:19:00.039
X and Y.
 

00:19:00.039 --> 00:19:01.180
That was most unfortunate.
 

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:05.244
But suppose I take 2 stocks and
I'm at the point where all my

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:06.328
money is in Y.
 

00:19:06.328 --> 00:19:10.900
So I'm going to take the case t
= 0.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:16.166
So if I took t = 0,
I would just have the variance

00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:16.920
of Y.
 

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.509
That's actually quite good,
the variance of Y.

00:19:19.509 --> 00:19:21.088
So I'd have all my money in Y.
 

00:19:21.088 --> 00:19:24.038
I'd have this standard
deviation and this expectation.

00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:31.788
Now what happens if the two are
independent, X and Y?

00:19:31.788 --> 00:19:35.210
Let's drop the fact that they
have the same variance now.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:39.160
Maybe X has way more variance
than Y does.

00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.259
So look, X is much riskier than
Y.

00:19:42.259 --> 00:19:46.345
Maybe X has a higher
expectation than Y,

00:19:46.345 --> 00:19:48.440
but it's so risky.
 

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.292
People who are risk averse
wouldn't ever want to subject

00:19:51.292 --> 00:19:53.108
themselves to all this risk,
say.

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:56.068
So maybe they should just stick
with Y, you would think.

00:19:56.068 --> 00:19:58.440
But no, the answer is,
you shouldn't,

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.701
because what happens if you
start to mix some of your money

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:05.690
in Y--
take a little out of Y and put

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:07.368
a little bit into X?
 

00:20:07.368 --> 00:20:10.867
Your expectation,
if you take a little money out

00:20:10.867 --> 00:20:14.723
of Y and put a little into X,
your expectation's going to go

00:20:14.723 --> 00:20:17.329
up, because it's going to be the
average of X and Y.

00:20:17.329 --> 00:20:18.730
So the expectation's going up.
 

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:20.900
But then you say,
"Oh, but my variance is

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.720
going up."
 

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.690
So I wouldn't want to do it,
but no, that's wrong.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:26.670
The variance isn't going up,
because they're independent.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:29.807
Even though X has a way higher
variance than Y,

00:20:29.807 --> 00:20:33.559
mixing a little between the two
lowers your variance.

00:20:33.559 --> 00:20:34.880
So how could that be?
 

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.558
Seems quite shocking.
 

00:20:37.558 --> 00:20:43.374
Well, let's take the derivative
of this with respect to having

00:20:43.374 --> 00:20:46.519
all your money originally in Y.
 

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:50.000
So this is the variance of
putting t dollars in X and 1 - t

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:50.420
in Y.
 

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.154
So we simply take the
derivative of that,

00:20:53.154 --> 00:20:55.480
which I've done here,
I suppose.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:57.390
Why don't I just write it out?
 

00:20:57.390 --> 00:21:07.558
Take the derivative of that,
d/dt of this = 2t times the

00:21:07.558 --> 00:21:15.880
variance of X 2 times (1 - t)
times (okay,

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:18.748
but this is a -,
so I take the derivative) it's

00:21:18.748 --> 00:21:26.307
2 times this times - 1,
so - 2T, 2 times (1 - t),

00:21:26.307 --> 00:21:29.869
variance of Y.
 

00:21:29.869 --> 00:21:34.660
Let's evaluate that at t = 0.
 

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.386
The first term is 0,
the t is 0, so this doesn't

00:21:37.386 --> 00:21:37.910
matter.
 

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:40.976
The second term,
t is 0, so this is - 2 times

00:21:40.976 --> 00:21:42.369
the variance of Y.
 

00:21:42.369 --> 00:21:44.509
It's going down.
 

00:21:44.509 --> 00:21:48.259
The variance is actually going
down here.

00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:50.808
So just as this says,
the variance starts down.

00:21:50.808 --> 00:21:53.568
Eventually, it has to end up
here, so as you move your money,

00:21:53.568 --> 00:21:56.930
all of it originally in Y and
start moving some of it into X,

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:01.769
your variance is going to go
down.

00:22:01.769 --> 00:22:06.375
So those two things put
together are the argument for

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:07.970
diversification.
 

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.349
If they're independent and
identical, then you should put

00:22:11.349 --> 00:22:12.920
half your money in each.
 

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.596
But even if they're not
identical, you shouldn't stick

00:22:15.596 --> 00:22:15.950
to Y.
 

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.750
You should mix Y with some X.
 

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:21.650
So there's why diversification
is such a good idea.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.348
So it's not all diversification.
 

00:22:23.348 --> 00:22:27.900
It's diversification of
independent risks.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.680
There's a bit of a mathematical
nuance.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.098
Diversification of independent
risks is bound to help you.

00:22:34.098 --> 00:22:37.942
Everybody should diversify a
little bit, because you can

00:22:37.942 --> 00:22:39.269
reduce your risk.
 

00:22:39.269 --> 00:22:44.868
That's the first important
thought.

00:22:44.868 --> 00:22:50.630
Now I don't want to do too much
in the mathematics.

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.445
So I prove in the notes,
but I won't do it here,

00:22:54.445 --> 00:22:58.670
suppose we didn't assume X and
Y were independent.

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:02.170
Suppose X and Y were
arbitrarily chosen.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:06.490
They have big covariance,
whatever you want.

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:10.647
Then what is going to happen
when you combine your money

00:23:10.647 --> 00:23:12.009
between X and Y.
 

00:23:12.009 --> 00:23:14.482
So there's a proof,
which I'm not going to give,

00:23:14.482 --> 00:23:17.430
because I'm a little bit
behind, so the proof is this.

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.337
Suppose we have exactly the
same situation,

00:23:20.337 --> 00:23:23.176
where you started with Y and
you've got X,

00:23:23.176 --> 00:23:27.538
and you could think of moving
you money in between X and Y.

00:23:27.538 --> 00:23:30.785
Well, it turns out,
if they're perfectly

00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:33.497
correlated,
so really they're the same

00:23:33.497 --> 00:23:35.578
thing, Y is just 80 percent of
X,

00:23:35.578 --> 00:23:38.669
it's the same stock,
so moving back between them is

00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:44.768
not really changing--
X is just a scalar improvement

00:23:44.768 --> 00:23:47.866
on Y,
so it has more expectation and

00:23:47.866 --> 00:23:49.538
more standard deviation.
 

00:23:49.538 --> 00:23:52.433
If that were the case,
you'd just move on that

00:23:52.433 --> 00:23:55.329
straight line that connects the
two points.

00:23:55.329 --> 00:23:57.848
I must have a way of doing this.
 

00:23:57.848 --> 00:24:01.332
Yes, if they were perfectly
correlated, you would just be

00:24:01.332 --> 00:24:04.940
moving along this line by
putting your money in between.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:08.410
If they're independent,
you're going to move along that

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:08.858
line.
 

00:24:08.858 --> 00:24:10.930
But no matter how correlated
they are,

00:24:10.930 --> 00:24:12.740
as long as they're not
perfectly correlated,

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:15.263
it's going to turn out the
curve you get by moving between

00:24:15.263 --> 00:24:16.769
them is going to look like that.
 

00:24:16.769 --> 00:24:19.230
If they're negatively
correlated, then you can really

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.880
improve yourself and get a curve
that looks like that.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.230
Independent will be like this,
positively correlated,

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:27.150
but not perfectly will be like
that,

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.108
and perfectly positively
correlated,

00:24:29.108 --> 00:24:31.788
no diversification gains,
you get the straight line,

00:24:31.788 --> 00:24:34.640
but you're always above the
straight line.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.394
So that's a kind of--anyway,
it takes a little bit of

00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:42.005
algebra to prove that,
you know, the Cauchy-Schwarz

00:24:42.005 --> 00:24:45.108
inequality, but I'm going to
skip that.

00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:46.930
But anyway, that's a
mathematical fact.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:51.066
You see in the independent
case, we proved that the line

00:24:51.066 --> 00:24:55.426
has to start going that way and
eventually it has to end up

00:24:55.426 --> 00:24:57.436
here,
so it should be no surprise

00:24:57.436 --> 00:24:59.720
that it looks like that in the
independent case.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.930
And then it turns out that
every other case is sort of in

00:25:01.930 --> 00:25:03.470
between that or at the other
extreme.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:08.460
It always has this bowed out
shape.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.531
So there's always gains to
diversification,

00:25:11.531 --> 00:25:15.190
something you're getting out of
diversification.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:19.700
The risk is somehow going down
by mixing things up.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:23.003
That's it, that's the
mathematics and that's the

00:25:23.003 --> 00:25:24.410
general principle.
 

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:26.920
Now, what can you get out of
this?

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.352
I want to derive these two
famous theorems,

00:25:29.352 --> 00:25:32.363
which we already saw in action
in the example that we

00:25:32.363 --> 00:25:34.970
calculated, but it seemed like a
miracle.

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.987
So what did we find in the
example we calculated last time

00:25:37.987 --> 00:25:38.568
in class?
 

00:25:38.568 --> 00:25:41.828
We found that--we only had two
stocks,

00:25:41.828 --> 00:25:45.384
but if there had been hundreds
of stocks and millions of states

00:25:45.384 --> 00:25:47.785
of nature,
and each person had a different

00:25:47.785 --> 00:25:49.568
utility,
different risk aversion,

00:25:49.568 --> 00:25:52.089
but all quadratic,
and you calculated the

00:25:52.089 --> 00:25:55.365
competitive equilibrium,
assuming there were Arrow

00:25:55.365 --> 00:25:58.377
securities,
it would end up that every

00:25:58.377 --> 00:26:02.558
consumer held the same mix of
all these stocks,

00:26:02.558 --> 00:26:06.298
positive or negative amounts of
the bond.

00:26:06.298 --> 00:26:08.980
So the mutual fund theorem
turned out to be true,

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.771
that the best thing everybody
could do was hold the same

00:26:11.771 --> 00:26:13.942
amount,
the same proportion of stocks

00:26:13.942 --> 00:26:16.318
and bonds,
and maybe more or less of the

00:26:16.318 --> 00:26:18.924
riskless asset,
maybe even negative of the

00:26:18.924 --> 00:26:19.920
riskless asset.
 

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:23.460
So I want to show you why
that's true now.

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:25.836
Then we're going to have to
talk about whether we really

00:26:25.836 --> 00:26:26.700
believe it or not.
 

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:30.509
So let's see what an
implication is.

00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:36.664
Suppose now what I do is I
write down--I have all these

00:26:36.664 --> 00:26:39.058
stocks, X, Y and Z.
 

00:26:39.058 --> 00:26:43.220
So you can imagine--you have a
certain amount of money--so you

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.766
can imagine putting your
money--so let's suppose that

00:26:46.766 --> 00:26:49.289
I've written down all the
stocks.

00:26:49.289 --> 00:26:51.220
The prices are given.
 

00:26:51.220 --> 00:27:00.670
Let's say prices of stocks are
in equilibrium.

00:27:00.670 --> 00:27:03.978
So I've solved for the
equilibrium like we did last

00:27:03.978 --> 00:27:06.558
time, and I write down X,
Q, Y and Z.

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:11.103
These are the expectation and
standard deviation per dollar of

00:27:11.103 --> 00:27:14.380
the stocks, or per I dollars of
the stock.

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.832
Maybe the person has exactly I
dollars, so let's say it's I

00:27:17.832 --> 00:27:20.509
dollars of each stock,
what their expectation,

00:27:20.509 --> 00:27:23.068
return and standard deviation
would be.

00:27:23.068 --> 00:27:25.568
If 1 dollar,
you get some expectation,

00:27:25.568 --> 00:27:28.578
standard deviation,
10 dollars of the same stock,

00:27:28.578 --> 00:27:32.038
you'd be able to buy 10 shares,
which means you would--

00:27:32.038 --> 00:27:36.186
10 times as many shares,
which means you'd have 10 times

00:27:36.186 --> 00:27:40.259
the expectation and 10 times the
standard deviation.

00:27:40.259 --> 00:27:44.894
So whatever the guy's income
is, they'll fix the returns as

00:27:44.894 --> 00:27:48.571
per his income,
because he's going to spend all

00:27:48.571 --> 00:27:51.049
his income on these stocks.
 

00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:52.618
So what could he do?
 

00:27:52.618 --> 00:27:55.755
He could put all his money into
X, he'd end up here,

00:27:55.755 --> 00:27:58.276
or all his money into Y,
he'd end up here,

00:27:58.276 --> 00:28:01.348
or all his money into Z,
and he'd end up here.

00:28:01.348 --> 00:28:05.077
But maybe he wants to divide
part of his money in Y,

00:28:05.077 --> 00:28:06.980
part in Z and part in Y.
 

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.818
He'll be somewhere like here.
 

00:28:08.818 --> 00:28:12.413
Or maybe he wants to instead
put part of his money in Z and

00:28:12.413 --> 00:28:13.529
part of it in X.
 

00:28:13.529 --> 00:28:15.190
Well, he could end up here.
 

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:17.028
But why should he stop there?
 

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:20.239
Maybe he wants to take some
combination of the money that

00:28:20.239 --> 00:28:23.676
was in Z and X and combine it
with some combination of things

00:28:23.676 --> 00:28:26.240
that was in Z and Y,
combine this and this.

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.108
That would get him out to here.
 

00:28:28.108 --> 00:28:31.298
So there are lots of different
combinations he could hold.

00:28:31.298 --> 00:28:33.970
So graphically,
it looks like that.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:40.839
Mathematically,
what's he trying to do?

00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:43.769
He's trying to--so R now.
 

00:28:43.769 --> 00:28:46.720
I've replaced A with R.
 

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:56.568
So R^(j) is just going to =
A^(j) divided by the price of j,

00:28:56.568 --> 00:28:59.240
maybe times I.
 

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.785
So R^(j) will be the--let's
just say it's A^(j) divided by

00:29:04.785 --> 00:29:06.440
pi_j.
 

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:09.788
So R^(j) is the return per
dollar you put in the asset.

00:29:09.788 --> 00:29:12.940
R^(j) is the payoff of the
asset per dollar.

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:13.788
Let's stick with that.
 

00:29:13.788 --> 00:29:17.038
Let's say the guy has a dollar
to spend, so it's the return per

00:29:17.038 --> 00:29:17.509
dollar.
 

00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:20.029
So those are all his
possibilities.

00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:21.269
Now what does he want to do?
 

00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:25.142
He wants to choose his money,
how much money he's going to

00:29:25.142 --> 00:29:28.131
put in each asset,
which is omega_1

00:29:28.131 --> 00:29:30.170
through omega_J.
 

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:32.358
That's the money he's going to
put in each asset.

00:29:32.358 --> 00:29:35.920
And if he does that,
he's going to have a portfolio,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.798
which I'll write as
R_omega,

00:29:38.798 --> 00:29:40.589
so it's going to have a certain
expectation,

00:29:40.589 --> 00:29:42.098
a certain variance.
 

00:29:42.098 --> 00:29:44.880
So the question is,
how should he divide his money

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.718
between the assets,
and here's the kind of stuff he

00:29:47.718 --> 00:29:49.078
could imagine doing.
 

00:29:49.078 --> 00:29:52.078
Looks very complicated,
but it's going to turn out to

00:29:52.078 --> 00:29:53.058
be very simple.
 

00:29:53.058 --> 00:30:00.538
So are there any questions
about what we're doing so far?

00:30:00.538 --> 00:30:05.887
I want to get a simple rule to
tell you, practical advice about

00:30:05.887 --> 00:30:07.009
what to do.
 

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:08.578
Markowitz posed this problem.
 

00:30:08.578 --> 00:30:14.970
This is the Markowitz problem,
okay?

00:30:14.970 --> 00:30:16.896
It turns out,
by this argument,

00:30:16.896 --> 00:30:20.365
you see if I keep combining
things over and over again,

00:30:20.365 --> 00:30:22.548
I'm getting this sort of blob.
 

00:30:22.548 --> 00:30:25.568
But the blob is always pushing
itself further and further out.

00:30:25.568 --> 00:30:27.903
It's always convex,
because given any two points,

00:30:27.903 --> 00:30:30.140
I can always do the thing to
the left of it.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:32.480
So if I could do this and I
could do this,

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.279
and I look at the line
connecting them,

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:37.696
I can always be above that line
by spreading my money between

00:30:37.696 --> 00:30:38.779
those two assets.
 

00:30:38.779 --> 00:30:41.266
Or given this combination of
assets that produces this

00:30:41.266 --> 00:30:43.048
expectation and standard
deviation,

00:30:43.048 --> 00:30:45.641
and given that one up there,
I could combine the two and do

00:30:45.641 --> 00:30:47.829
better than the straight line
connecting them,

00:30:47.829 --> 00:30:48.750
do to the left of it.
 

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:51.644
So therefore,
all of the combinations put

00:30:51.644 --> 00:30:53.887
together have to,
geometrically,

00:30:53.887 --> 00:30:56.058
look like this in the end.
 

00:30:56.058 --> 00:30:58.690
So I'm going to do this
algebraically in a second.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:02.950
They have to look like that if
I did every possible variation.

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:09.092
It couldn't end up with a
picture where after I do every

00:31:09.092 --> 00:31:12.661
possible variation--
if this is the expectation,

00:31:12.661 --> 00:31:15.536
this is the standard deviation,
I couldn't get something that

00:31:15.536 --> 00:31:17.910
looked like that,
because I would just combine

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.288
this thing with this thing.
 

00:31:19.288 --> 00:31:22.192
Whatever portfolio produced
this, whatever portfolio

00:31:22.192 --> 00:31:24.775
produced that,
I'd put half my money into each

00:31:24.775 --> 00:31:26.858
of the stocks that this told me
to do,

00:31:26.858 --> 00:31:29.558
half the money into each of the
stocks this told me to do.

00:31:29.558 --> 00:31:32.173
I'd still end up investing 1
dollar and instead of getting

00:31:32.173 --> 00:31:34.558
the line, I'd get something that
looked like that.

00:31:34.558 --> 00:31:36.549
So I couldn't have the thing
going in like that.

00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:37.598
It has to go out.
 

00:31:37.598 --> 00:31:40.573
But then of course,
I can combine this and this and

00:31:40.573 --> 00:31:44.318
get that, and so I'm going to
end up with this kind of shape.

00:31:44.318 --> 00:31:47.098
Now I'm going to prove that
algebraically.

00:31:47.098 --> 00:31:49.538
But if I had that kind of
shape, then what would the guy

00:31:49.538 --> 00:31:49.759
do?
 

00:31:49.759 --> 00:31:52.880
He'd choose something like
that, where he's tangent.

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.894
That's what Markowitz basically
did, except he did it

00:31:56.894 --> 00:31:58.130
algebraically.
 

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:03.578
So that's what Markowitz did.
 

00:32:03.578 --> 00:32:05.650
That doesn't seem to have
gotten us very far.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.142
You notice that different
people are going to make

00:32:08.142 --> 00:32:09.160
different choices.
 

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:12.923
If somebody is incredibly
worried--someone's not very

00:32:12.923 --> 00:32:17.048
worried about the standard
deviation and cares a lot about

00:32:17.048 --> 00:32:20.480
expectation,
they're going to have a flatter

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.900
indifference curve.
 

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.273
So instead of looking like
that, it will be a flatter

00:32:24.273 --> 00:32:24.640
thing.
 

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.710
And so if it's flatter,
the guy who cares--

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:29.904
sorry, if it's flatter,
it means he cares about

00:32:29.904 --> 00:32:31.910
expectation and not standard
deviation,

00:32:31.910 --> 00:32:35.720
because a little bit of
expectation can compensate him

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.380
for a lot more standard
deviation,

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:39.859
so his indifference curve is
flatter.

00:32:39.859 --> 00:32:41.690
He's going to choose further up.
 

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.769
So he's going to choose a point
like way up there.

00:32:44.769 --> 00:32:47.595
So he's going to get a higher
expectation and higher standard

00:32:47.595 --> 00:32:48.160
deviation.
 

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.462
Someone who's more risk averse
is going to choose where that

00:32:51.462 --> 00:32:52.078
point is.
 

00:32:52.078 --> 00:32:55.269
So that's qualitatively what's
going on.

00:32:55.269 --> 00:32:58.059
So Markowitz played around with
this, played around with this.

00:32:58.059 --> 00:33:00.430
Then Tobin appears on the scene.
 

00:33:00.430 --> 00:33:04.415
Tobin says, "All this gets
so much easier if you have a

00:33:04.415 --> 00:33:05.970
riskless asset."
 

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:09.308
Let's suppose that there's a
bond.

00:33:09.308 --> 00:33:11.368
You haven't mentioned the bond
yet.

00:33:11.368 --> 00:33:14.980
Let's suppose we have a bond
that pays something for sure,

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.959
and we're going to ignore
inflation, Tobin said,

00:33:17.959 --> 00:33:19.670
which is a big problem.
 

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:22.180
We should come back to that if
we have time.

00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:25.000
We're going to ignore
inflation, so US Treasury's

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.940
going to pay a certain amount of
money for sure.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:32.369
So it has an expectation like
this, but no standard deviation.

00:33:32.369 --> 00:33:34.759
It's 0.
 

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:37.220
Now why is this so important?
 

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:42.570
Let's imagine combining this
riskless bond with some other

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:45.670
stock X, 1 dollar's worth of X.
 

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:49.440
1 dollar's worth of the
riskless bond gets you 1.06 say.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.490
1 dollar's worth of X gets you
much--you know,

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:56.288
maybe your average is 1.12,
but you're also running a big

00:33:56.288 --> 00:33:56.900
risk.
 

00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:02.068
What happens if you put your
money part way in between them?

00:34:02.068 --> 00:34:07.273
So suppose you put part of your
money in X, and the rest of your

00:34:07.273 --> 00:34:09.670
money in the riskless bond.
 

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:12.230
What's your expectation going
to be?

00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:16.181
Your expectation,
let's say X is 12 percent and Y

00:34:16.181 --> 00:34:18.403
is 6 percent,
1.06 and 1.12,

00:34:18.403 --> 00:34:23.344
the average is going to be 1.09
if you put half your money in

00:34:23.344 --> 00:34:24.250
both.
 

00:34:24.250 --> 00:34:28.630
But what is the standard
deviation going to be?

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:31.360
I claim it's just going to be
on this straight line.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.239
Why is that?
 

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:35.489
Because the riskless thing has
covariance 0.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:39.641
If X is riskless,
its covariance is going to be 0

00:34:39.641 --> 00:34:40.420
with Y.
 

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.510
So these terms are going to
disappear.

00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:44.960
Look at the covariance.
 

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:50.599
If X--ifY is the riskless bond,
it pays always its expectation.

00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:52.469
So these numbers are always 0.
 

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:56.414
Therefore the covariance of
that thing with anything,

00:34:56.414 --> 00:35:00.210
the covariance of Y with any X
is going to be 0.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:05.362
And not only that,
but the variance of Y itself is

00:35:05.362 --> 00:35:06.309
also 0.
 

00:35:06.309 --> 00:35:09.882
So all you get is,
for the variance of the t

00:35:09.882 --> 00:35:14.702
dollars in X and 1 - t dollars
in Y, you just get t squared

00:35:14.702 --> 00:35:17.030
times the variance of X.
 

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:19.759
But then when you take the
standard deviation,

00:35:19.759 --> 00:35:22.670
it's just t times the standard
deviation of X.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:26.125
So in other words,
the standard deviation of the

00:35:26.125 --> 00:35:29.360
mixture of Y and X lies right on
the line.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:32.362
So unlike--to put it another
way, something that has no

00:35:32.362 --> 00:35:35.307
variance is perfectly correlated
with everything else,

00:35:35.307 --> 00:35:36.809
it makes no difference.
 

00:35:36.809 --> 00:35:41.001
When the other thing goes up or
down, it doesn't tell you--you

00:35:41.001 --> 00:35:43.340
still know what Y's going to be.
 

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:46.188
So unlike everything else,
where you have this bow shaped

00:35:46.188 --> 00:35:48.934
thing, the riskless asset just
connects everything to a

00:35:48.934 --> 00:35:49.849
straight line.
 

00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:54.106
So if there were a riskless
asset and you could do this with

00:35:54.106 --> 00:35:57.496
some X and here was a Z,
you could also do that,

00:35:57.496 --> 00:35:59.300
or you could do that.
 

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.119
Is this clear?
 

00:36:01.119 --> 00:36:03.847
Okay, so the punch line,
which we're now going to see

00:36:03.847 --> 00:36:06.490
algebraically,
the punch line is--and by the

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.753
way, if I combine,
what does it mean to extend

00:36:09.753 --> 00:36:10.590
that line?
 

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.800
I should have extended that
line.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.250
That was a huge mistake.
 

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:17.836
Suppose instead of--so here's
all the money in the riskless

00:36:17.836 --> 00:36:18.469
asset.
 

00:36:18.469 --> 00:36:21.519
Here's half the money in the
riskless asset and half in X.

00:36:21.519 --> 00:36:23.079
Here's all my money in X.
 

00:36:23.079 --> 00:36:25.429
What would happen if I extended
the line here?

00:36:25.429 --> 00:36:27.670
What would that correspond to?
 

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:29.849
I'm now at a point on the
extension of the line.

00:36:29.849 --> 00:36:31.690
How do I get that?
 

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.407
Student:
You borrow money and invest it

00:36:34.407 --> 00:36:34.829
in X.
 

00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:35.449
Prof: Right.
 

00:36:35.449 --> 00:36:39.440
That's negative Y and bigger
than 1 in X.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:43.393
So negative 1 half of X 1 and 1
half of Y, that's still 1

00:36:43.393 --> 00:36:44.030
dollar.
 

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:47.943
I sold X short and so I'm just
going to continue the line that

00:36:47.943 --> 00:36:48.329
way.
 

00:36:48.329 --> 00:36:49.980
So I shouldn't have stopped
here.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:52.050
I could have kept going.
 

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:55.175
So it's putting money in the
bank and sharing it between a

00:36:55.175 --> 00:36:57.150
single stock puts me on this
line.

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:00.088
Borrowing money from the bank
to put in a stock is called

00:37:00.088 --> 00:37:02.817
leveraging my return,
puts me on the extension of the

00:37:02.817 --> 00:37:03.289
line.
 

00:37:03.289 --> 00:37:04.929
We're going to come back to
that in a second.

00:37:04.929 --> 00:37:09.429
So knowing that,
now what should I do?

00:37:09.429 --> 00:37:12.909
Is there something really
simple?

00:37:12.909 --> 00:37:18.280
Well, what would you do here,
faced with this choice?

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:25.980
Which combination of stocks and
bonds would you hold?

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:28.550
I say it's really simple.
 

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:33.208
You just look for a line
through the riskless point

00:37:33.208 --> 00:37:38.279
that's tangent to this blurb,
which happens to be here,

00:37:38.279 --> 00:37:43.630
and now you should choose your
point anywhere along this line,

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:47.809
independent of what your
mean-variance utilities are.

00:37:47.809 --> 00:37:54.233
No matter how risk averse you
are or how risk loving you are,

00:37:54.233 --> 00:37:59.159
you should choose somewhere
along this line.

00:37:59.159 --> 00:38:01.300
Why is that?
 

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.806
Well, I've drawn,
with this blob,

00:38:03.806 --> 00:38:08.036
I've drawn all the possible
combinations I could get by

00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:10.699
mixing different risky assets.
 

00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:14.226
What I left out of the picture
is all the combinations I could

00:38:14.226 --> 00:38:16.250
get by adding the riskless
asset.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:18.010
I've got all the risky asset
combinations.

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.429
That's the blob.
 

00:38:19.429 --> 00:38:23.525
Now I want to do--adding the
riskless asset means I can take

00:38:23.525 --> 00:38:26.650
part of my money in here and
part in there.

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.094
So in particular,
I can put part of my money here

00:38:29.094 --> 00:38:31.539
and part of my money there,
or I can go short.

00:38:31.539 --> 00:38:34.873
So whatever this combination
was, that's the best thing I can

00:38:34.873 --> 00:38:37.929
do, because now I can get
everything along this line.

00:38:37.929 --> 00:38:39.659
Nothing else can do better.
 

00:38:39.659 --> 00:38:41.920
What other combination could
there be?

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.969
It has to be the riskless asset
a bunch of risky assets.

00:38:45.969 --> 00:38:50.460
But combining the risky assets
just puts me in the blob.

00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:52.300
So it might put me here in the
blob.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:54.961
And then once I combine that
with the riskless asset,

00:38:54.961 --> 00:38:56.139
I'll be on that line.
 

00:38:56.139 --> 00:38:58.963
This line is always below that
line, so this is the best

00:38:58.963 --> 00:39:00.300
possible thing I can do.
 

00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:04.340
No combination of the riskless
asset and any other combination

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.699
of risky assets,
that'll always put me on some

00:39:07.699 --> 00:39:10.523
line from here,
through some point in the blob,

00:39:10.523 --> 00:39:12.940
which is going to be below this
tangent point.

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:14.869
So this is the best thing I can
do.

00:39:14.869 --> 00:39:18.753
And it's independent of whether
I was risk averse or a risk

00:39:18.753 --> 00:39:19.289
lover.
 

00:39:19.289 --> 00:39:21.628
If I'm risk averse and want to
play it safe,

00:39:21.628 --> 00:39:24.619
my utility function--I forgot
what those looked like.

00:39:24.619 --> 00:39:32.139
My indifference curves--I'll be
here.

00:39:32.139 --> 00:39:34.974
I'll put most of my money in
the bank and not very many in

00:39:34.974 --> 00:39:35.869
the risky stock.
 

00:39:35.869 --> 00:39:38.195
If I'm more of a risk lover,
I'll be maybe here,

00:39:38.195 --> 00:39:40.969
and I'll choose to put a good
fraction of my money in the

00:39:40.969 --> 00:39:42.949
stock and only a little in the
bank.

00:39:42.949 --> 00:39:46.288
If I'm really reckless,
I'll borrow money and put it in

00:39:46.288 --> 00:39:48.699
the stock market and be way up
there.

00:39:48.699 --> 00:39:52.286
But everybody will do the same
thing, no matter what their

00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:53.420
preferences are.
 

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.880
They'll all be along the same
line.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.219
So that's the mutual fund
theorem.

00:40:00.219 --> 00:40:02.130
Why is that the mutual fund
theorem?

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:05.809
Because it says everybody
should invest in the same index

00:40:05.809 --> 00:40:09.159
of stocks and put more or less
money in the bank.

00:40:09.159 --> 00:40:11.929
So every single person ought to
be doing the same thing.

00:40:11.929 --> 00:40:16.739
This is the mutual fund that
everybody should hold.

00:40:16.739 --> 00:40:20.161
Whatever combination of stocks
that got me to this point is the

00:40:20.161 --> 00:40:22.480
mutual fund that everybody
should hold,

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.789
and combine that with putting
money in the bank.

00:40:25.789 --> 00:40:30.463
Okay, so let's just prove that
algebraically,

00:40:30.463 --> 00:40:35.349
in a special case,
which is going to illustrate

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:39.280
the point, the idea of it
anyway.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:42.445
I'm doing a very special case
here, but just to illustrate it

00:40:42.445 --> 00:40:43.289
algebraically.
 

00:40:43.289 --> 00:40:49.570
So suppose that the Rs are,
as we said, the returns,

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:53.389
up here, per dollar of stock.
 

00:40:53.389 --> 00:40:57.235
The R_0 I've now
added and that's going to be the

00:40:57.235 --> 00:41:00.750
riskless asset that pays like 1
dollar 6 all the time,

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.268
if the interest rate is 6
percent.

00:41:03.268 --> 00:41:06.849
So now you have your money,
you have I dollars.

00:41:06.849 --> 00:41:08.389
You're the investor with I
dollars.

00:41:08.389 --> 00:41:13.358
You can divide that money into
the riskless asset or any one of

00:41:13.358 --> 00:41:14.559
the J assets.
 

00:41:14.559 --> 00:41:16.369
So here you've got R^(0).
 

00:41:16.369 --> 00:41:20.103
You can get that return,
R^(1) up to R^(J) and you can

00:41:20.103 --> 00:41:21.985
put money,
omega_0,

00:41:21.985 --> 00:41:24.458
omega_1,
omega_J,

00:41:24.458 --> 00:41:27.880
but of course,
this all has to add up to I.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.409
So how should you do it?
 

00:41:29.409 --> 00:41:33.851
Well, you care about your
expectation and you hate

00:41:33.851 --> 00:41:38.563
variance, so I'm doing just a
special case to make it

00:41:38.563 --> 00:41:40.739
illustrate the idea.
 

00:41:40.739 --> 00:41:44.516
Suppose I write down your
utility as if it were the

00:41:44.516 --> 00:41:47.690
expectation, - alpha times the
variance.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:49.570
It could be a more complicated
function.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:54.378
We said already that the
quadratic utilities give you

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:59.742
expectation - alpha expectation
squared, - some other alpha

00:41:59.742 --> 00:42:01.869
times the variance.
 

00:42:01.869 --> 00:42:04.409
That's the utility we derive
from quadratic--

00:42:04.409 --> 00:42:07.710
when people have quadratic
utilities over consumption,

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:11.760
their induced utility of
portfolios is this thing.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.092
So it's not exactly the one
I've written down,

00:42:14.092 --> 00:42:17.306
but the argument would be just
the same and this is shorter and

00:42:17.306 --> 00:42:17.929
simpler.
 

00:42:17.929 --> 00:42:20.059
So just to illustrate the
flavor of it,

00:42:20.059 --> 00:42:23.088
let's say all you care about is
your expectation - some

00:42:23.088 --> 00:42:26.340
constant, how risk averse you
are, times the variance.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:29.679
Now let's suppose,
to keep it even simpler,

00:42:29.679 --> 00:42:32.699
that the assets are all
independent.

00:42:32.699 --> 00:42:34.690
The theory doesn't rely on that.
 

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:36.561
I'm just saying,
suppose it were so we can

00:42:36.561 --> 00:42:39.119
algebraically get it without
having to work very hard.

00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:41.534
So you're maximizing your
expectations,

00:42:41.534 --> 00:42:44.139
so the bar above means the
expectation.

00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:46.193
So what's your expectation of
omega dollars in here,

00:42:46.193 --> 00:42:48.530
omega_1 in here and
omega_J in here?

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.880
Just omega_0 times
the expectation of this.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:55.465
So your expectation then is
going to be omega_0

00:42:55.465 --> 00:42:58.476
times R^(0) bar (that's the
expectation of that)

00:42:58.476 --> 00:43:02.909
omega_1,
R bar^(1) omega_J,

00:43:02.909 --> 00:43:07.809
R bar^(J).
 

00:43:07.809 --> 00:43:09.760
These are the top for some
reason.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.239
That's your expectation.
 

00:43:11.239 --> 00:43:14.179
Now what's your variance,
the thing that you don't like?

00:43:14.179 --> 00:43:21.434
Your variance is going to
be--is going to be the variance

00:43:21.434 --> 00:43:22.860
of these.
 

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.719
They're independent.
 

00:43:23.719 --> 00:43:30.360
So the variance is just going
to be what I've written.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:33.849
So call the variance of R^(J)
sigma,

00:43:33.849 --> 00:43:36.197
so it's going to be
sigma_0 squared

00:43:36.197 --> 00:43:38.704
(that's the variance of
sigma_0) times

00:43:38.704 --> 00:43:42.269
omega_0 squared,
(remember, because for variance

00:43:42.269 --> 00:43:45.168
you have to square if you
multiply by something)

00:43:45.168 --> 00:43:48.619
omega_1 squared
sigma_1 squared,

00:43:48.619 --> 00:43:53.079
omega_J squared
sigma_J squared.

00:43:53.079 --> 00:43:56.108
Now of course,
remember that the variance of

00:43:56.108 --> 00:43:59.489
the riskless thing is 0,
so that's actually 0.

00:43:59.489 --> 00:44:02.079
This is the variance you have
to watch out for.

00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:04.329
This is the expectation you
want.

00:44:04.329 --> 00:44:06.532
How should you pick
omega_0,

00:44:06.532 --> 00:44:08.677
omega_1,
omega_J,

00:44:08.677 --> 00:44:12.250
when your penalty for having
too much variance is alpha?

00:44:12.250 --> 00:44:14.985
So different investors have
different risk aversions so they

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:16.099
have different alphas.
 

00:44:16.099 --> 00:44:18.619
Should they be led,
as Markowitz thought,

00:44:18.619 --> 00:44:20.820
without the riskless asset,
remember,

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:23.309
with the blob like this,
one guy was going to pick here,

00:44:23.309 --> 00:44:24.679
another guy was going to pick
there.

00:44:24.679 --> 00:44:26.710
They'd all do very different
things.

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:29.981
Tobin added this riskless
asset, and lo and behold,

00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:32.599
now everyone should do the same
thing.

00:44:32.599 --> 00:44:33.260
So why is that?
 

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.251
We just reduce this
algebraically,

00:44:35.251 --> 00:44:36.760
solve it algebraically.
 

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.980
So the constraint is a nuisance.
 

00:44:38.980 --> 00:44:41.280
To maximize something with the
constraint's a nuisance,

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.969
so if you just notice that if
you satisfy the constraint,

00:44:43.969 --> 00:44:47.079
omega_0 has to equal
I - the sum of the

00:44:47.079 --> 00:44:48.440
omega_js.
 

00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:51.998
So if I substitute for
omega_0 right up

00:44:51.998 --> 00:44:55.260
there, I substitute I - the sum
of the js.

00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:00.597
Then I'm going to get R bar^(0)
times I - R bar^(0) times

00:45:00.597 --> 00:45:03.932
omega_1,
- R bar^(0) times

00:45:03.932 --> 00:45:06.030
omega_2.
 

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.780
But I can feed that into the
other thing,

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:14.278
so I get R^(0) times the I,
and then the R^(1) term is

00:45:14.278 --> 00:45:18.003
going to be R bar^(1) times
omega_1 - the thing

00:45:18.003 --> 00:45:22.260
that came from subtracting the
omega_1 there in I--

00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:26.577
by replacing omega_0
with (I - omega_1 -

00:45:26.577 --> 00:45:28.480
omega_J),
etc.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:31.981
So I'm going to notice--all
these other terms now,

00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:35.840
I get rid of the constraint and
all the other terms get

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:36.768
replaced.
 

00:45:36.768 --> 00:45:41.210
R bar^(2) gets replaced by R
bar^(2) - R bar^(0).

00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:44.940
I've dropped sigma_0
because it's 0.

00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.083
So I'm maximizing something
without a constraint by plugging

00:45:48.083 --> 00:45:50.268
in the constraint to
omega_0.

00:45:50.268 --> 00:45:53.108
So I have to choose my
omega_1 through

00:45:53.108 --> 00:45:56.554
omega_J and then
omega_0 is determined

00:45:56.554 --> 00:45:57.400
from that.
 

00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.112
But I'm maximizing one thing,
so just take the derivative

00:46:00.112 --> 00:46:02.534
with respect to each
omega_i and set it =

00:46:02.534 --> 00:46:02.969
to 0.
 

00:46:02.969 --> 00:46:04.449
So with respect to
omega_1,

00:46:04.449 --> 00:46:13.739
say, it's going to be R bar^(1)
- R bar^(0) - 2 alpha sigma--

00:46:13.739 --> 00:46:16.548
I'm differentiating with
respect to omega_1 so

00:46:16.548 --> 00:46:19.869
it's 2 alpha omega_1
times sigma_1 squared.

00:46:19.869 --> 00:46:24.429
2 alpha omega_1 times
sigma_1 squared = 0.

00:46:24.429 --> 00:46:28.806
So therefore omega_1
= R^(1) - R^(0) over 2 alpha

00:46:28.806 --> 00:46:30.920
sigma_1 squared.
 

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.137
But if I did it now with
respect to 2 or to 3 or to 4,

00:46:34.137 --> 00:46:37.721
nothing--I would get the same
formula, just with a j instead

00:46:37.721 --> 00:46:38.389
of a 1.
 

00:46:38.389 --> 00:46:42.327
So that's the formula everybody
picks and notice it depends on

00:46:42.327 --> 00:46:43.360
what alpha is.
 

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.632
So people with different alphas
are going to put different

00:46:46.632 --> 00:46:48.929
amounts of money in
omega_j.

00:46:48.929 --> 00:46:53.130
But it depends on alpha in a
very trivial way.

00:46:53.130 --> 00:46:57.467
So if I took the fraction,
the relative amounts of money I

00:46:57.467 --> 00:47:01.730
put in i and j and divided this
by omega_i,

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.032
by omega_j,
I would get that the alphas and

00:47:05.032 --> 00:47:06.429
the 2s canceled out.
 

00:47:06.429 --> 00:47:09.688
So everybody would put R^(i) -
R bar^(0) divided by

00:47:09.688 --> 00:47:12.697
sigma_i squared,
R bar^(j) - R^(0) over

00:47:12.697 --> 00:47:14.070
sigma_j squared.
 

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.949
That number doesn't depend on
who the person is,

00:47:16.949 --> 00:47:19.668
so the relative amounts of
money put in i and j are

00:47:19.668 --> 00:47:21.679
independent of what your alpha
is,

00:47:21.679 --> 00:47:22.989
independent of the person.
 

00:47:22.989 --> 00:47:25.289
So unlike this old Markowitz
case,

00:47:25.289 --> 00:47:29.907
the Tobin case looks like that,
and everybody chooses the same

00:47:29.907 --> 00:47:34.070
combination of risky assets and
then this safe asset.

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:36.199
So it may be that different
people put different

00:47:36.199 --> 00:47:39.545
combinations of safe and risky,
but everybody's proportion of

00:47:39.545 --> 00:47:42.659
risky assets is proportional to
everybody else's.

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:44.429
That's what we just proved
algebraically.

00:47:44.429 --> 00:47:47.686
So graphically,
a sort of general proof,

00:47:47.686 --> 00:47:50.360
algebraically,
a special case.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:52.079
And then if you were in a
graduate class,

00:47:52.079 --> 00:47:54.869
you'd get an algebraic proof in
general,

00:47:54.869 --> 00:47:56.829
which is actually much faster
than either of these,

00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:58.989
but you have to know a little
linear algebra.

00:47:58.989 --> 00:48:00.719
And so that's the proof.
 

00:48:00.719 --> 00:48:02.059
It's a very simple thing.
 

00:48:02.059 --> 00:48:06.733
It's a remarkable thing,
and here's the famous Tobin

00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:07.650
diagram.
 

00:48:07.650 --> 00:48:11.016
Everybody should do that,
put their money in the same

00:48:11.016 --> 00:48:14.449
combination of risky assets and
the riskless asset.

00:48:14.449 --> 00:48:19.809
Are there any questions about
this?

00:48:19.809 --> 00:48:22.110
It's kind of shocking.
 

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:26.751
I could swear that most people
think, maybe even rightly,

00:48:26.751 --> 00:48:31.641
if you really want to go for
it, put your money in the young

00:48:31.641 --> 00:48:33.880
Microsoft or something.
 

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:37.846
It could be a tremendous
success or it could go out of

00:48:37.846 --> 00:48:38.670
business.
 

00:48:38.670 --> 00:48:41.400
That's what you should do,
but no, this says not at all.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:44.695
If you really want to go for
it, take the same index that

00:48:44.695 --> 00:48:47.639
everybody, the S&amp;P 500 and
just leverage it.

00:48:47.639 --> 00:48:50.298
Borrow a lot of money and go
out that straight line,

00:48:50.298 --> 00:48:52.018
way out to there,
to the right.

00:48:52.018 --> 00:48:53.409
Don't put your money in
Microsoft.

00:48:53.409 --> 00:48:58.300
Just leverage the hell out of
the S&amp;P 500.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.704
Okay, so after this theory was
created--I'm going to tease out

00:49:02.704 --> 00:49:04.800
all the implications of it.
 

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.838
After this theory was created,
the mutual fund business took

00:49:08.838 --> 00:49:09.250
off.
 

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.380
Vanguard and all of these
places, what did they do?

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.829
They said, "Look,
economic science has taught us,

00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:18.670
the best you can do is not try
to pick individual stocks.

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.347
The best you can do is to hold
the same index,

00:49:22.347 --> 00:49:23.900
the whole market.
 

00:49:23.900 --> 00:49:25.534
"Now of course,
it's very expensive for you to

00:49:25.534 --> 00:49:26.320
hold the whole market.
 

00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.177
Are you going to go to a broker
and tell him 'Buy me 3 shares of

00:49:29.177 --> 00:49:31.266
this and 7 shares of that and 9
shares of that,

00:49:31.266 --> 00:49:32.309
14 shares of that'?
 

00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:34.715
It'll take the guy forever to
buy all that stuff and you have

00:49:34.715 --> 00:49:36.800
to pay a commission on every
single thing you buy.

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.259
It's going to cost you so much
money to do what economic

00:49:39.259 --> 00:49:39.929
science says.
 

00:49:39.929 --> 00:49:41.389
Come to us at Vanguard.
 

00:49:41.389 --> 00:49:43.780
We'll buy the whole market for
you,

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.885
call it our index fund and
charge you almost no commission

00:49:46.885 --> 00:49:48.617
at all,
just a tiny little bit,

00:49:48.617 --> 00:49:50.579
because we're doing it in such
bulk,

00:49:50.579 --> 00:49:53.000
everyone's--we've got lots of
investors like you.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.389
They're all buying the same
thing.

00:49:54.389 --> 00:49:57.675
We have huge volume,
so we're going to get a really

00:49:57.675 --> 00:50:01.027
small brokerage fee,
so you should put your money in

00:50:01.027 --> 00:50:02.210
with us."
 

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:03.889
So that's what everybody
started to do.

00:50:03.889 --> 00:50:06.659
So all these mutual funds and
money managers,

00:50:06.659 --> 00:50:10.333
they all grew up,
originally by guaranteeing to

00:50:10.333 --> 00:50:14.105
produce an index fund,
the very same thing economic

00:50:14.105 --> 00:50:17.250
science recommended,
at almost no cost.

00:50:17.250 --> 00:50:20.869
If you read Swensen's book,
his first,

00:50:20.869 --> 00:50:24.327
most important piece of advice:
if you are a standard investor

00:50:24.327 --> 00:50:27.333
who doesn't know how to
manipulate all the complicated

00:50:27.333 --> 00:50:30.509
instruments on Wall Street and
has transactions costs and

00:50:30.509 --> 00:50:33.570
things like that,
put all your money into an

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:34.030
index.
 

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.518
That's what he recommends doing.
 

00:50:35.518 --> 00:50:38.427
And he says everyone else who
tells you otherwise is just

00:50:38.427 --> 00:50:40.610
trying to steal your money,
rip you off.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:46.469
So that's the main financial
advice that economists give now.

00:50:46.469 --> 00:50:51.159
It's Shakespeare's advice.
 

00:50:51.159 --> 00:50:54.400
Don't put all your eggs in one
basket, but it's very specific.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:58.646
Put it in an index where you
buy everything in the same

00:50:58.646 --> 00:50:59.670
proportion.
 

00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:01.597
Now of course,
if you're buying everything in

00:51:01.597 --> 00:51:03.614
the same proportion and
everybody's doing that,

00:51:03.614 --> 00:51:04.929
what does this have to be?
 

00:51:04.929 --> 00:51:06.579
I forgot to say that.
 

00:51:06.579 --> 00:51:09.257
If everybody's buying every
stock in the same proportion,

00:51:09.257 --> 00:51:11.840
that proportion must be the
market, because that's what

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:12.989
everybody's holding.
 

00:51:12.989 --> 00:51:15.860
So this doesn't turn out to be
any old portfolio.

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.579
It's the market portfolio.
 

00:51:17.579 --> 00:51:21.489
So the index,
that's a huge conclusion here,

00:51:21.489 --> 00:51:24.273
the index that they should
offer is not just some magical

00:51:24.273 --> 00:51:26.460
index that's better than
everything else,

00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:28.039
because if everyone's doing the
right thing,

00:51:28.039 --> 00:51:30.119
everyone's choosing the same
index--

00:51:30.119 --> 00:51:32.385
that's what we proved--if
everyone's choosing the same

00:51:32.385 --> 00:51:34.248
index,
it must be the market index,

00:51:34.248 --> 00:51:36.309
because that's all there is to
choose.

00:51:36.309 --> 00:51:37.789
Supply has to equal demand.
 

00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:43.079
So therefore the advice is to
put all your money into the

00:51:43.079 --> 00:51:46.009
market index,
not just an index,

00:51:46.009 --> 00:51:50.449
the market index maybe put
money in a bank.

00:51:50.449 --> 00:51:55.690
Or even borrow from a bank to
put it into the market index.

00:51:55.690 --> 00:52:01.682
That's the first surprising
theorem that Tobin proved and it

00:52:01.682 --> 00:52:07.170
had dramatic--so it created the
indexed investments.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:08.530
It created Vanguard.
 

00:52:08.530 --> 00:52:11.534
So these people who run these
companies, I forgot the guy's

00:52:11.534 --> 00:52:12.829
name who runs Vanguard.
 

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:14.739
He's always giving these
speeches.

00:52:14.739 --> 00:52:17.405
So that's how he describes how
he got his start in his

00:52:17.405 --> 00:52:17.960
business.
 

00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:19.599
All he says is,
"I take all the

00:52:19.599 --> 00:52:21.519
recommendations of economic
science,"

00:52:21.519 --> 00:52:23.202
he says,
"and I allow people to

00:52:23.202 --> 00:52:23.840
carry them out.
 

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.380
That's why I'm doing great good
for society.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.389
Everybody else,
all these hedge funds and

00:52:28.389 --> 00:52:30.050
stuff, they're ruining society.
 

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.269
I am just doing what Tobin told
us to do."

00:52:32.269 --> 00:52:36.079
That's his basic speech.
 

00:52:36.079 --> 00:52:40.659
So Markowitz was a little bit
more precise even than that.

00:52:40.659 --> 00:52:43.815
Markowitz' formula and Tobin's
special case,

00:52:43.815 --> 00:52:46.309
he not only told you what to
do.

00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:48.177
He told you,
"do what everyone else is

00:52:48.177 --> 00:52:48.800
doing."
 

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.909
He told you what that should be.
 

00:52:50.909 --> 00:52:55.239
So let's suppose that I've got
2 stocks,

00:52:55.239 --> 00:53:02.530
i and j, with the same return,
same expected return,

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:09.030
but one has standard deviation
3 times higher than the other.

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:11.981
So in my picture here,
that standard picture,

00:53:11.981 --> 00:53:15.065
we've got the standard
deviation, we've got the

00:53:15.065 --> 00:53:16.139
expectation.
 

00:53:16.139 --> 00:53:20.740
We've got 1 stock here and
we've got another stock here

00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:23.980
with 3 times the standard
deviation.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.612
So you might have thought,
"Well, these 2 stocks,

00:53:26.612 --> 00:53:28.900
same expected return,
what's the difference?

00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.079
Put all my money in one or the
other, doesn't matter."

00:53:31.079 --> 00:53:33.213
A little bit further thought
would say, "Well,

00:53:33.213 --> 00:53:34.920
this one is much better than
that one.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.065
I've got smaller standard
deviation, so I should put all

00:53:38.065 --> 00:53:39.840
my money into this one."
 

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:44.893
But then on further thought,
given that these two are

00:53:44.893 --> 00:53:48.199
independent, what should you do?
 

00:53:48.199 --> 00:53:53.077
How should you allocate your
money between this stock and

00:53:53.077 --> 00:53:54.210
that stock?
 

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:59.389
What does the formula tell you
to do?

00:53:59.389 --> 00:54:09.789
It's very clear.
 

00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:14.869
Well, the ratio of money in one
stock to the other stock looks

00:54:14.869 --> 00:54:16.369
like this ratio.
 

00:54:16.369 --> 00:54:19.916
But I've told you that the
expectations of the 2 stocks are

00:54:19.916 --> 00:54:20.590
the same.
 

00:54:20.590 --> 00:54:22.300
So those things are the same.
 

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:30.798
I've told you that one has 3
times the standard deviation

00:54:30.798 --> 00:54:35.048
than the other,
so therefore,

00:54:35.048 --> 00:54:38.539
what should you do?
 

00:54:38.539 --> 00:54:39.030
Yeah.
 

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:42.362
Student:
Hold 9 times as much as the one

00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:44.530
with the lower--
Prof: Exactly.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:50.233
You should put 90 percent in
this stock, 10 percent in that

00:54:50.233 --> 00:54:51.018
stock.
 

00:54:51.018 --> 00:54:55.050
That's it, because if one
sigma's 3 times the other,

00:54:55.050 --> 00:54:56.989
and you square it,
it's going to be 9 times the

00:54:56.989 --> 00:54:58.880
other,
and so obviously you have to

00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:01.630
figure out what's in the
numerator and what's in the

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:02.440
denominator.
 

00:55:02.440 --> 00:55:04.181
But clearly,
you're going to put more of

00:55:04.181 --> 00:55:06.860
your money in the lower standard
deviation, so it's 90/10.

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:10.079
So it's very concrete advice.
 

00:55:10.079 --> 00:55:15.762
So the first concrete advice
is, the first concrete thing

00:55:15.762 --> 00:55:20.329
we've gotten out of this is,
buy the index.

00:55:20.329 --> 00:55:25.224
Now the index typically in
America, they're easy to buy,

00:55:25.224 --> 00:55:27.360
are indexes of stocks.
 

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.090
But you know,
the second piece of advice is,

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:34.039
and this is also Swensen's
second most important point--

00:55:34.039 --> 00:55:36.909
I'm quoting Swensen because
we're here at Yale,

00:55:36.909 --> 00:55:39.130
not because he's the only one
to recognize these things,

00:55:39.130 --> 00:55:42.940
but he was a student of
Tobin--so the second important

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:46.610
point is that you should not
just buy the index,

00:55:46.610 --> 00:55:48.989
because the indexes are the
wrong index.

00:55:48.989 --> 00:55:51.110
The index should be the index
of everything.

00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:54.246
It should include American
stocks, Chinese stocks,

00:55:54.246 --> 00:55:55.974
French stocks,
Greek stocks,

00:55:55.974 --> 00:55:57.190
Israeli stocks.
 

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:59.981
You should have all stocks in
the index, but you can't really

00:55:59.981 --> 00:56:01.889
very easily buy all those other
things.

00:56:01.889 --> 00:56:05.420
You can only very easily buy
index of American things.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:09.099
It's getting easier and easier
now to buy the global index.

00:56:09.099 --> 00:56:11.670
But anyway, you should buy the
global index.

00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:14.099
That's what this says.
 

00:56:14.099 --> 00:56:18.438
So every time you find a new
independent risk you should look

00:56:18.438 --> 00:56:19.090
for it.
 

00:56:19.090 --> 00:56:24.878
So you should buy the global
index, seek out independent

00:56:24.878 --> 00:56:25.719
risks.
 

00:56:25.719 --> 00:56:28.130
So what did Swensen do?
 

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:31.110
One of his most important
things was, Yale is always

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:33.739
looking globally to find
independent risks.

00:56:33.739 --> 00:56:38.563
So let's go back to the--so you
should always find independent

00:56:38.563 --> 00:56:41.489
risks, and you suffer if you
don't.

00:56:41.489 --> 00:56:45.342
So you see, by putting 90
percent here and 10 percent

00:56:45.342 --> 00:56:49.789
here, Markowitz is telling you,
you're going to do better.

00:56:49.789 --> 00:56:56.489
What else do I have to say?
 

00:56:56.489 --> 00:56:59.510
So let's go back to our dice
example.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:04.739
Suppose that you had 1 dice.
 

00:57:04.739 --> 00:57:08.465
Now by the way,
I want to introduce one more

00:57:08.465 --> 00:57:12.018
term, which I'll call the Sharpe
ratio.

00:57:12.018 --> 00:57:18.760
So the slope of this line--so
it's the Tobin diagram.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:23.503
It should be called the Tobin
ratio, but this other guy at

00:57:23.503 --> 00:57:28.079
Stanford snuck in and managed to
give his name to it.

00:57:28.079 --> 00:57:30.510
He ended up getting a Nobel
prize too.

00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:34.021
So here this line,
the slope of this line,

00:57:34.021 --> 00:57:38.302
this is the riskless asset--the
slope of this line,

00:57:38.302 --> 00:57:41.300
what is the slope of this line?
 

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.789
So this is standard deviation,
this is expectation.

00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:47.780
The slope, what's the slope?
 

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:54.628
Well, it's the expectation of
whatever you're holding,

00:57:54.628 --> 00:58:03.030
X, - the riskless asset divided
by the standard deviation of X.

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:07.000
That's the Sharpe ratio of X.
 

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:12.000
So you notice that every point
you could conceivably choose,

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.692
which is somewhere in this
blob, then connect it to the

00:58:14.692 --> 00:58:17.534
riskless asset--
so every point on this line

00:58:17.534 --> 00:58:20.199
obviously has the same Sharpe
ratio.

00:58:20.199 --> 00:58:22.365
If you leveraged your position
and went to here,

00:58:22.365 --> 00:58:24.210
you wouldn't change your Sharpe
ratio.

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:25.400
It has the same slope.
 

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.657
If you put half your money in
the bank and half in the

00:58:27.657 --> 00:58:28.891
riskless asset,
you'd be here,

00:58:28.891 --> 00:58:29.829
same Sharpe ratio.
 

00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:34.619
Anything else you could do has
a lower Sharpe ratio.

00:58:34.619 --> 00:58:46.467
So another thing to say is that
an investor managing all his

00:58:46.467 --> 00:58:54.699
money should maximize the Sharpe
ratio.

00:58:54.699 --> 00:58:58.570
You could in fact tell if
somebody had screwed up.

00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:01.659
Instead of doing the global
index, they just did the

00:59:01.659 --> 00:59:03.847
American index,
pick something here,

00:59:03.847 --> 00:59:07.250
you could look at the slope of
where they ended up and it would

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.719
be a worse slope and a worse
Sharpe ratio.

00:59:09.719 --> 00:59:11.570
You could even judge people,
how they're doing,

00:59:11.570 --> 00:59:12.980
by looking at their Sharpe
ratio.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:16.230
So let's take the case of the 2
dice.

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:19.820
Suppose you had 1 die.
 

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:23.018
So if you had 1 die,
remember, if you invest 100

00:59:23.018 --> 00:59:26.150
dollars, you could get 101,102,
through 106.

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:29.820
Let's say the interest rate is
3 percent.

00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:37.297
So you could get 101,102,
103,104, 105,106,

00:59:37.297 --> 00:59:43.530
with 1 sixth probability of
each.

00:59:43.530 --> 00:59:47.126
So the average of that is
obviously 103.5,

00:59:47.126 --> 00:59:50.989
right, because 1 and 6 is 7,
and divide by 2,

00:59:50.989 --> 00:59:52.130
is 103.5.
 

00:59:52.130 --> 00:59:58.108
So the expected payoff for
putting your money into 1 dice

00:59:58.108 --> 01:00:01.739
is the average return,
is 1.035.

01:00:01.739 --> 01:00:08.077
The riskless return is going to
be 1.03, so it's .035 - .03,

01:00:08.077 --> 01:00:08.829
.005.
 

01:00:08.829 --> 01:00:10.920
And now what's the standard
deviation?

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:12.449
What's the variance of this?
 

01:00:12.449 --> 01:00:15.923
Well, you could take 101 -
103.5 squared,

01:00:15.923 --> 01:00:18.268
103 - 103.5 squared,
etc.

01:00:18.268 --> 01:00:24.510
and take the square root of it,
and you'd get .017.

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:27.286
So you notice the chance of
losing money,

01:00:27.286 --> 01:00:29.230
by the way, is 50 percent.
 

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:33.648
50 percent of the time,
you're going to lose money,

01:00:33.648 --> 01:00:37.360
and your Sharpe ratio is .005
over .017.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.590
So that's about 3--no,
it's about .3.

01:00:41.590 --> 01:00:44.387
Now that happens to be the
Sharpe ratio of the stock

01:00:44.387 --> 01:00:45.539
market, just about.
 

01:00:45.539 --> 01:00:47.840
Shockingly low,
isn't it, if you look at the

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:50.688
history of the stock market--
so it depends what year you

01:00:50.688 --> 01:00:53.570
start and what year you end,
if you do it right after a

01:00:53.570 --> 01:00:57.621
crash or before a crash,
but just to pick vague numbers

01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:02.769
it's 9 percent and let's say the
interest rate is 4 percent,

01:01:02.769 --> 01:01:04.340
something like that.
 

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:06.460
It could be 5 percent or 3
percent.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.900
Depends again the period.
 

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:11.780
Maybe it's 2 percent,
but somewhere like that.

01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:15.269
And the standard deviation of
the stock market is 16 percent

01:01:15.269 --> 01:01:18.110
or 12 percent,
again depending on what period.

01:01:18.110 --> 01:01:22.630
But always around 12 to 18
percent, let's say 16 percent.

01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:26.550
That's the one I like to use,
because it's percent a day.

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:34.503
So that's = to 5 percent over
16 percent, which is about 1

01:01:34.503 --> 01:01:35.619
third.
 

01:01:35.619 --> 01:01:37.980
It's about .3.
 

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:41.219
That's exactly what this dice
has, about .3.

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:43.159
So that's all you can get out
of the stock market.

01:01:43.159 --> 01:01:45.460
Not a very good Sharpe ratio.
 

01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.340
So you could measure Swensen's
Sharpe ratio.

01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.518
You could measure Ellington's
Sharpe ratio and see what they

01:01:50.518 --> 01:01:50.739
are.
 

01:01:50.739 --> 01:01:52.940
You can see who you think is a
better manager.

01:01:52.940 --> 01:02:04.420
So I won't tell you those
numbers just yet.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.800
But now let's suppose,
what else could I do?

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.280
So let's suppose you put your
money in two dice.

01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:12.630
That's the whole point of this.
 

01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:15.193
Suppose you put half your money
in the first dice and half your

01:02:15.193 --> 01:02:16.268
money in the second die.
 

01:02:16.268 --> 01:02:19.530
Now what are the
chances--what's going to happen?

01:02:19.530 --> 01:02:23.063
Well, again,
your expected return hasn't

01:02:23.063 --> 01:02:23.969
changed.
 

01:02:23.969 --> 01:02:27.188
It's still .035,
but the Sharpe ratio has

01:02:27.188 --> 01:02:28.960
drastically changed.
 

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.090
In fact, you could see that.
 

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.996
What are the chances of ending
up with 101 dollars now,

01:02:32.996 --> 01:02:35.849
if you put half your money in
each, the worst case?

01:02:35.849 --> 01:02:37.239
It's not 1 in 6.
 

01:02:37.239 --> 01:02:39.719
You have to get the worst case
in both dice.

01:02:39.719 --> 01:02:43.510
So to get 101 dollars,
it's 1 in 36.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:46.983
It's vastly less likely that
you end up with this extreme bad

01:02:46.983 --> 01:02:49.880
outcome once you put half the
money in each die.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.293
So if you compute the standard
deviation, it's going to be a

01:02:53.293 --> 01:02:54.510
lot smaller number.
 

01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:59.130
It's going to be .012.
 

01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:03.534
So the Sharpe ratio's gone from
.3 to .4, just by finding the

01:03:03.534 --> 01:03:04.489
second die.
 

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:06.239
So what you should be doing is
looking,

01:03:06.239 --> 01:03:08.570
like Swensen does,
like everybody does,

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:11.463
for those independent risks
that the rest of the market is

01:03:11.463 --> 01:03:12.480
too stupid to see.
 

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:15.746
Even after they got the idea of
the index, for 20 years,

01:03:15.746 --> 01:03:18.833
they didn't realize the index
should mean everything,

01:03:18.833 --> 01:03:20.260
not just in America.
 

01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:22.871
So you'd have a huge
opportunity to do better than

01:03:22.871 --> 01:03:24.309
the rest of the managers.
 

01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:27.101
While everyone else is screwing
around on this line,

01:03:27.101 --> 01:03:29.400
you can be screwing around on
that line.

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.059
So you could run the same risk
this guy did.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:36.909
So Swensen says,
you could leverage--

01:03:36.909 --> 01:03:38.179
not that he does,
but if you're Harvard and

01:03:38.179 --> 01:03:39.570
you're on this thing instead of
this thing,

01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:42.340
you could leverage and go up
here and say,

01:03:42.340 --> 01:03:45.108
"Look, I've got the same
standard deviation everybody

01:03:45.108 --> 01:03:47.219
else does,
and look at my returns.

01:03:47.219 --> 01:03:49.440
They're so much higher than
everybody else's."

01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:51.139
So that's what Harvard is
trying to do.

01:03:51.139 --> 01:03:54.409
They're trying to globally
diversify,

01:03:54.409 --> 01:03:57.090
cut down their standard
deviation and then leverage,

01:03:57.090 --> 01:04:00.567
and compared to everybody else,
get a higher return with the

01:04:00.567 --> 01:04:02.099
same standard deviation.
 

01:04:02.099 --> 01:04:03.840
So that's the first implication
of the theory.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.409
Now the second implication is
the best part.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:11.619
Let's hope I get to it.
 

01:04:11.619 --> 01:04:13.329
I'm going to skip over leverage.
 

01:04:13.329 --> 01:04:19.619
The second story is coming
right up.

01:04:19.619 --> 01:04:23.510
How are these things priced?
 

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:28.500
I have to get to the second
part of Shakespeare.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:32.190
What can we say about the
pricing of individual stocks?

01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:36.128
It looks like an individual
stock is going to be worth more

01:04:36.128 --> 01:04:39.320
if it contributes no variance,
less variance.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.139
But that turns out to be
completely wrong.

01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:46.250
It's shocking that that's wrong.
 

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:49.110
So why is this?
 

01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:53.056
The crucial thing is,
remember back to our first

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:54.150
principles.
 

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:57.840
What is price = to?
 

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.599
What is the key ingredient of
price?

01:04:59.599 --> 01:05:03.679
What is it always = to in basic
economics?

01:05:03.679 --> 01:05:05.170
Student:
Supply and demand.

01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.159
Prof: Supply and demand,
okay.

01:05:06.159 --> 01:05:10.706
But an individual's going to
buy so that price is = to his

01:05:10.706 --> 01:05:12.780
marginal utility,
right?

01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:19.306
So we have to figure out--what
we've shown so far is that

01:05:19.306 --> 01:05:23.268
everybody is holding the market.
 

01:05:23.268 --> 01:05:30.610
Everybody's holding a market,
maybe with some riskless asset.

01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:33.885
So they're holding the market,
plus maybe they're long or

01:05:33.885 --> 01:05:36.402
short the bonds,
but that's not creating any

01:05:36.402 --> 01:05:37.280
covariance.
 

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.813
So if I'm holding the market
and I hold a little bit more of

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:44.530
a stock,
so if I could pay a little bit

01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:48.440
more and buy t units of stock X,
what good would it do me?

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.309
Well, the expectation,
the change in expectation,

01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:55.960
with t dollars of X would be,
as I increase t a little bit,

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:58.817
the derivative of my
expectation is just the

01:05:58.817 --> 01:06:00.079
expectation of X.
 

01:06:00.079 --> 01:06:04.815
So by holding the new stock,
I get expectation of--I get a

01:06:04.815 --> 01:06:05.980
little more.
 

01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:09.530
I get t times the expectation
of X, I hope.

01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:12.855
By coming up with t extra
dollars, I could increase my

01:06:12.855 --> 01:06:16.369
expectation by t times the
expectation of X obviously.

01:06:16.369 --> 01:06:18.119
But what would happen to my
variance?

01:06:18.119 --> 01:06:23.146
If I look at the variance of
this, what happens to my

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:24.210
variance?
 

01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:32.983
Which is = (for variance I
could write) is the covariance

01:06:32.983 --> 01:06:37.369
of this with itself,
tX M.

01:06:37.369 --> 01:06:42.543
So everybody's supposed to hold
M some riskless thing,

01:06:42.543 --> 01:06:45.960
negative or positive in the
bond.

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:51.119
But the negative or positive in
the bond is riskless asset.

01:06:51.119 --> 01:06:53.268
That contributes nothing to the
covariance.

01:06:53.268 --> 01:06:56.221
I might as well just look at
the covariance of a little bit

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:57.849
of money in X with the market.
 

01:06:57.849 --> 01:06:59.659
And what's that covariance
going to be?

01:06:59.659 --> 01:07:04.360
Well, it's covariance of t,
tX and,

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:12.585
tX, covariance of tX and M
(these are definitely not 0

01:07:12.585 --> 01:07:19.226
anymore) covariance of--
so it's 2,2t,

01:07:19.226 --> 01:07:24.039
covariance of tX and M.
 

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:31.760
And then it's the,
covariance of M with itself.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.949
So it's the covariance of tX
with itself,

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:37.436
tX with tX, twice the
covariance of tX with M and then

01:07:37.436 --> 01:07:40.110
this tX with M,
2 covariance tX with M,

01:07:40.110 --> 01:07:42.510
and the covariance of M with
itself.

01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:47.510
Now I want to differentiate
that thing with respect to t.

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:50.336
If I put just a little bit of
money, that's being on the

01:07:50.336 --> 01:07:53.010
margin, what's the marginal
effect on my variance?

01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:56.159
I hate variance,
but see the mistake people have

01:07:56.159 --> 01:08:00.179
made in the past is they said,
"People hate variance.

01:08:00.179 --> 01:08:02.690
Therefore a stock that has a
lot of variance is bad."

01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:04.619
Absolutely wrong reasoning.
 

01:08:04.619 --> 01:08:07.579
That was Adam Smith's puzzle
about water and diamonds.

01:08:07.579 --> 01:08:09.760
You know, why is water less
expensive than diamonds when

01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.070
water's so much more important?
 

01:08:11.070 --> 01:08:13.500
It's not how important the
whole thing is;

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:16.426
it's how important one tiny
extra drop of it is,

01:08:16.426 --> 01:08:17.859
the marginal utility.
 

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:20.908
So if you add a tiny bit of X
to what you're already holding,

01:08:20.908 --> 01:08:22.960
which might involve a bunch of
X already,

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.359
so you add a tiny bit more of X
to what you're already holding,

01:08:26.359 --> 01:08:28.470
what's going to be the change
in your variance?

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.498
So it's the derivative of this
with respect to t,

01:08:31.498 --> 01:08:32.319
when t = 0.
 

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:37.213
So this, by the way,
= t squared,

01:08:37.213 --> 01:08:46.543
variance of X 2 covariance--2t
times the covariance of X and M

01:08:46.543 --> 01:08:49.908
the variance of M.
 

01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:56.090
I'm differentiating this with
respect to t.

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:57.100
Right?
 

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.890
Because I've just rewritten the
same thing.

01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:00.850
That's just t squared,
the variance of X.

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:03.512
The t comes out,
2t covariance of X with M,

01:09:03.512 --> 01:09:05.479
and here's the variance of M.
 

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:08.109
But if I differentiate with
respect to t,

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:13.837
I get 2t variance of X
(remember, it's the derivative

01:09:13.837 --> 01:09:21.296
of t when t is 0),
2t variance of X 2 covariance

01:09:21.296 --> 01:09:25.181
of X and M 0,
because the variance of M

01:09:25.181 --> 01:09:26.210
doesn't depend on t.
 

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:30.260
So at t = 0, this is also 0.
 

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.302
So you see the change in my
variance, when I add a little

01:09:34.302 --> 01:09:37.770
more of X, is twice the
covariance of X and M.

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:39.560
So what is it that X adds?
 

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:42.979
It adds some expectation and it
also adds some variance,

01:09:42.979 --> 01:09:45.342
but not according to the
variance of X,

01:09:45.342 --> 01:09:48.078
according to the covariance of
X with M.

01:09:48.078 --> 01:09:51.237
When I add some more--the price
of water is how much extra

01:09:51.237 --> 01:09:53.729
utility I get,
given what I've already got.

01:09:53.729 --> 01:09:55.198
I've already got a huge amount
of water.

01:09:55.198 --> 01:09:57.529
That's why an extra amount of
water's not doing much for me.

01:09:57.529 --> 01:09:59.050
That's why the price is low.
 

01:09:59.050 --> 01:10:01.488
So X itself might be very
dangerous,

01:10:01.488 --> 01:10:04.100
but if it's independent of all
the other stuff,

01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:06.494
M, that you're holding,
in fact, you're only adding a

01:10:06.494 --> 01:10:08.609
drop of it,
it won't change your variance

01:10:08.609 --> 01:10:09.369
hardly at all.
 

01:10:09.369 --> 01:10:14.279
So this is 0.
 

01:10:14.279 --> 01:10:16.979
It's the covariance.
 

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:20.796
So that's the crucial idea,
that the marginal contribution

01:10:20.796 --> 01:10:24.813
of every stock depends on its
expectation and its covariance,

01:10:24.813 --> 01:10:26.220
not its variance.
 

01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:29.988
And the expectation is good and
the covariance is bad.

01:10:29.988 --> 01:10:32.873
And all of this is linear,
because it's differentiable,

01:10:32.873 --> 01:10:35.920
so it just says that--this is
the change in covariance.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:40.144
So remember the guy,
the marginal utility of

01:10:40.144 --> 01:10:41.520
expectation.
 

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:42.829
How am I doing in time?
 

01:10:42.829 --> 01:10:43.770
1 more minute.
 

01:10:43.770 --> 01:10:47.779
Marginal utility of expectation
times the expectation of X,

01:10:47.779 --> 01:10:50.590
that's the change,
when you add 1 dollar's worth--

01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:53.458
a tiny bit of X,
your expectation goes up by the

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:54.618
expectation of X.
 

01:10:54.618 --> 01:10:57.225
So this is the marginal utility
of expectation,

01:10:57.225 --> 01:11:00.002
which is the good thing,
- the marginal utility of

01:11:00.002 --> 01:11:00.739
variance.
 

01:11:00.739 --> 01:11:02.060
That's the bad thing.
 

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.640
And what's the change?
 

01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:10.292
The thing that affects--the
contribution to variance is the

01:11:10.292 --> 01:11:13.158
covariance of X with M.
 

01:11:13.158 --> 01:11:17.559
So the punch line is,
everybody has a linear tradeoff

01:11:17.559 --> 01:11:20.689
between expectation and
covariance.

01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:24.319
So for any fixed person,
it's just a constant times the

01:11:24.319 --> 01:11:28.219
expectation of X - a constant
times--this doesn't depend on

01:11:28.219 --> 01:11:29.430
the portfolio.
 

01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:32.198
This is the marginal utility at
his consumption.

01:11:32.198 --> 01:11:34.760
Marginal utility of expectation
at his consumption.

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.752
You face him with any possible
new thing that he could buy,

01:11:37.752 --> 01:11:40.279
just like a consumer in the
first day of class.

01:11:40.279 --> 01:11:42.085
He could buy apples,
he could buy oranges,

01:11:42.085 --> 01:11:43.010
he could buy pears.
 

01:11:43.010 --> 01:11:45.532
The marginal utility of each
one of those at the point he's

01:11:45.532 --> 01:11:46.750
already chosen to consume.
 

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:49.050
This is a number that's fixed,
this is a number that's fixed.

01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:51.460
Whatever X I put in here,
that's what I get.

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:54.496
So there's a linear tradeoff
between expectation and

01:11:54.496 --> 01:11:55.270
covariance.
 

01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:57.408
Expectation good,
covariance bad.

01:11:57.408 --> 01:12:02.734
So the final picture is that in
equilibrium, what you should

01:12:02.734 --> 01:12:08.420
have is every stock--this is
called the security market line.

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:09.788
This is the expectation of X.
 

01:12:09.788 --> 01:12:14.590
This is the covariance of X
with M.

01:12:14.590 --> 01:12:17.109
So what we've found is that it
should look like this.

01:12:17.109 --> 01:12:19.100
There has to be a linear
relationship.

01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:23.128
In order to want the stock--if
it's got a higher covariance,

01:12:23.128 --> 01:12:25.520
that means it's adding bad
stuff.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.948
You wouldn't want it unless it
had a higher expectation.

01:12:28.948 --> 01:12:32.368
So here's the riskless asset
right here.

01:12:32.368 --> 01:12:35.510
So this is a different diagram
than the Tobin diagram.

01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:37.689
It's expectation and covariance.
 

01:12:37.689 --> 01:12:42.750
Every stock is along this line.
 

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:44.970
Should be priced along this
line.

01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:50.916
So let me end with a puzzle,
the one we started with on the

01:12:50.916 --> 01:12:53.069
first day of class.
 

01:12:53.069 --> 01:12:57.322
If I have two companies,
General Motors and AIDS--an

01:12:57.322 --> 01:12:58.988
anti AIDS company.
 

01:12:58.988 --> 01:13:01.220
Some scientist at Yale
discovers a cure for AIDS.

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:02.670
He calls it AIDS.
 

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.420
He discovers a cure for AIDS.
 

01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:08.170
If the thing works,
he'll make a fortune.

01:13:08.170 --> 01:13:10.668
If the thing doesn't work,
of course, it's going to go

01:13:10.668 --> 01:13:12.319
bankrupt and pay anyone no
money.

01:13:12.319 --> 01:13:15.515
Let's say we calculate the
expected profits of General

01:13:15.515 --> 01:13:16.180
Electric.
 

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.619
General Motors is too junky now.
 

01:13:17.619 --> 01:13:18.939
General Electric.
 

01:13:18.939 --> 01:13:22.067
Let's say the expected profits
of General Electric = the

01:13:22.067 --> 01:13:24.569
expected profits of the
anti-AIDS company.

01:13:24.569 --> 01:13:33.930
Which will sell for a higher
price?

01:13:33.930 --> 01:13:35.779
Student:
General Electric.

01:13:35.779 --> 01:13:36.880
Prof: Will sell for a
higher price.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.908
Why?
 

01:13:37.908 --> 01:13:39.311
Student:
&gt;

01:13:39.311 --> 01:13:40.470
the variability of the outcome.
 

01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:42.445
Prof: Okay,
that's what you should have

01:13:42.445 --> 01:13:45.170
said at the beginning of class,
but not at the end of class.

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:45.720
Who's saying that?
 

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.890
Down here.
 

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.090
Who said that?
 

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:50.260
Who just said that?
 

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.500
I don't want to embarrass
anyone.

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:52.720
All right, you're anonymous.
 

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.939
I didn't see who it was,
so exactly.

01:13:54.939 --> 01:13:58.680
That's what you would have
thought before this class began.

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.170
Everybody hates variance.
 

01:14:00.170 --> 01:14:03.979
The AIDS company is so risky,
you could get a fortune or 0.

01:14:03.979 --> 01:14:05.538
You couldn't get riskier than
that.

01:14:05.538 --> 01:14:09.088
General Electric is not going
to go bankrupt very easily and

01:14:09.088 --> 01:14:12.518
it's not going to suddenly
multiply its value by 100 times

01:14:12.518 --> 01:14:13.180
either.
 

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:14.529
It's much more solid.
 

01:14:14.529 --> 01:14:16.220
So which would you pay more for?
 

01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.908
Everyone at the beginning of
the class,

01:14:17.908 --> 01:14:19.488
I think, would have said like
he did,

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:21.850
whoever he is,
would have said "General

01:14:21.850 --> 01:14:23.760
Electric,
you'd pay more for."

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.229
But the answer's not General
Electric.

01:14:25.229 --> 01:14:27.090
Why is that?
 

01:14:27.090 --> 01:14:28.310
Yes?
 

01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:31.067
Student:
Because the cure for AIDS

01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:35.340
actually working is uncorrelated
with the state of the economy,

01:14:35.340 --> 01:14:37.340
&gt;
 

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:37.930
Prof: Exactly.
 

01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:39.949
That's the shocking fact.
 

01:14:39.949 --> 01:14:41.710
That's the shocking conclusion.
 

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.755
So Shakespeare,
yes, "Nothing ventured,

01:14:43.755 --> 01:14:44.850
nothing gained."
 

01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:47.779
You have to take a risk to
expect a higher return.

01:14:47.779 --> 01:14:53.210
Everyone would have thought
that's the anti-AIDS company.

01:14:53.210 --> 01:14:55.260
No it's not,
and Shakespeare couldn't

01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:57.140
possibly have figured this out.
 

01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:00.659
It's General Electric is the
one with the higher risk,

01:15:00.659 --> 01:15:03.449
because it's correlated with
the market.

01:15:03.449 --> 01:15:05.038
It's correlated with the market.
 

01:15:05.038 --> 01:15:07.470
Obviously if people are rich,
they're going to buy more

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.630
refrigerators and engines and
stuff like that.

01:15:09.630 --> 01:15:12.162
If business isn't doing very
well, they're not going to buy

01:15:12.162 --> 01:15:12.729
that stuff.
 

01:15:12.729 --> 01:15:14.600
It's very correlated with the
market.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:18.390
Anti-AIDS, if it cures AIDS,
people are going to buy it.

01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:20.421
If they've got AIDS,
they're going to buy it no

01:15:20.421 --> 01:15:23.027
matter what, otherwise they
won't, so it's uncorrelated with

01:15:23.027 --> 01:15:23.689
the market.
 

01:15:23.689 --> 01:15:27.443
So therefore the price of the
AIDS company is going to be its

01:15:27.443 --> 01:15:29.319
expected payoff,
discounted.

01:15:29.319 --> 01:15:31.076
The price of General Motors
[correction: General Electric]

01:15:31.076 --> 01:15:32.979
is going to be much less,
because it's going to be

01:15:32.979 --> 01:15:35.189
punished for having a
correlation with the market.

01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:38.173
Therefore the return on General
Electric is going to be much

01:15:38.173 --> 01:15:39.997
higher,
because the same expected

01:15:39.997 --> 01:15:42.877
payoff and a lower price,
your return's going to be

01:15:42.877 --> 01:15:44.510
higher in General Electric.
 

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:47.360
That's the shocking thing that
Shakespeare couldn't have

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:47.880
noticed.
 

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.319
So yes, we're just doing what
Shakespeare said in the

01:15:50.319 --> 01:15:52.805
beginning, but in a way he
couldn't possibly have done

01:15:52.805 --> 01:15:54.118
without any mathematics.

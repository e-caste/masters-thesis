RONALD SMITH: Well, today
we're going to talk

00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:06.000
about mixing and dilution.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.267
When you add something to
the atmosphere, gases or

00:00:09.267 --> 00:00:12.567
particles, what happens to it?

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:13.767
How does it mix in?

00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:15.967
To what degree does
it get diluted?

00:00:15.967 --> 00:00:20.800
This is a subject that has
applications to human-induced

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.733
air pollution, but also to
a large number of natural

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:26.667
processes in the atmosphere.

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:32.567
So it's really a set of quite
fundamental ideas.

00:00:32.567 --> 00:00:36.133
And I could be thinking about
either small particles or

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.467
gases added to the atmosphere.

00:00:38.467 --> 00:00:42.467
Basically, something that's
going to move with the air and

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.033
mix in, in a way.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.833
If the particles are large
enough, of course, they might

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:50.167
gravitationally fall
out after awhile.

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:53.500
And that effect would not be
included in the calculations

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.033
I'm doing here.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:58.100
So I'm assuming the particles
are small or it's a gas so

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.500
that it will just move along
with the air itself.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.567
So the easiest case--

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:10.433
maybe it's a little bit,
unnatural, but not so much

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:15.667
--is that you're in a confined
valley and you know the

00:01:15.667 --> 00:01:17.000
dimensions of the valley--

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.700
horizontal dimensions of the
valley, and the valley is

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.767
capped, in some way.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:25.733
I've written here that it's
capped by an inversion.

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:30.700
Now, I'll give a more careful
and physical interpretation of

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.667
inversion later on, but an
inversion is defined as a

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:38.433
layer of air in which
the temperature

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:42.133
increases with height.

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.400
And for reasons that are not at
all clear, from what I've

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.967
just said, but will become
clear, it's very difficult for

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:52.700
mixing to occur across
an inversion.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.100
An inversion tends to act
almost like a rigid lid.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.033
It holds air and pollutants
below it or in any way,

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:04.633
prevents it from crossing.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:08.333
In this case, it traps these

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.700
pollutants below the inversion.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.800
So leaving that as only
partially defined concept for

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.033
a moment, we'll know then the
volume of the air into which

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:24.500
the pollution from my little
power plant here has reached.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.600
The volume into which the
substance has mixed is then

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.600
the product of the two
horizontal dimensions, L1 and

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.567
L2, and the depth of the layer,
that's the depth up to

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:38.367
the inversion.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:42.033
The mass of the air into which
the pollutant has mixed is

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:46.633
just the product of the air
density and that volume.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:50.900
And that's going to have units
of kilograms. So here comes a

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.233
very simple example.

00:02:52.233 --> 00:03:00.067
Let's that over some period of
time we put in 40 metric tons

00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:02.167
of a pollutant.

00:03:02.167 --> 00:03:07.300
Maybe it's small particles,
for example, or a gas.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.067
A metric ton, you recall, is a
thousand kilograms. So I've

00:03:11.067 --> 00:03:16.300
written that in SI units as 40
times 10 to the 3 kilograms.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.300
That's the amount of pollutant
we've put in.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.267
That's quite a bit, but it
depends on the problem we're

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.333
working on.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:25.433
Let's say that the horizontal
dimensions of the valley are

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:29.633
10 kilometers in one dimension
and 10 kilometers in the other

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:32.233
dimension and that
the depth to the

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:35.067
inversion is one kilometer.

00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:43.333
So then the concentration of the
pollutant is going to be

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:48.167
the mass of the pollutant
divided by the mass of the air

00:03:48.167 --> 00:03:50.467
into which it has mixed.

00:03:50.467 --> 00:03:53.100
I didn't put that definition up
here, but be sure you get

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.033
that in your notes.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:59.733
We're defining concentration in
this case as a mass ratio.

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:02.833
The mass of pollutant that
you've added to the atmosphere

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:06.700
divided by the mass of the air
into which it has mixed.

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:12.967
So here's the formula then.

00:04:12.967 --> 00:04:16.333
There's the mass of pollutant
that we added, 40 times 10 to

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:20.000
the three kilograms, and here's
the mass of the air

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.600
into which it mixed, it's the
air density multiplied times

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.267
the volume of the air--

00:04:26.267 --> 00:04:30.567
L1 L2 times D. So it's 10
kilometers expressed in

00:04:30.567 --> 00:04:34.433
meters, 10 kilometers again,
and one kilometer

00:04:34.433 --> 00:04:35.800
expressed in meters.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.000
You work all that out, you
get 0.4 times 10 to the 6

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.700
kilograms per kilogram.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.200
You could cancel it out and
say it has no units.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.167
That's fine.

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:48.067
Or you could leave it as
kilograms per kilogram, just

00:04:48.067 --> 00:04:49.967
to remind you what it is.

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:53.867
It's a kilogram of pollutant
mixed into a certain number of

00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:59.167
kilograms of the air into
which you mixed it.

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:04.900
So since this is 10 to the minus
6 and it's a mass ratio,

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.867
I could also write this
as 0.4 ppmm, parts

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:12.500
per million by mass.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.800
The per million, the pm there,
refers to the 10

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.500
to the minus 6.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.167
And the last m there
refers to the fact

00:05:20.167 --> 00:05:23.533
that it's a mass ratio.

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:23.800
Question?

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:24.100
Yes.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.367
STUDENT: Why is it kilograms
of pollutant?

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.200
PROFESSOR: Well, because I've
got the kilograms

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.433
here, but it's kilograms of
pollutant divided by the

00:05:32.433 --> 00:05:35.333
kilograms of air into which
it's been mixed.

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:36.300
STUDENT: So they don't
cancel out?

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.233
PROFESSOR: They could.

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:38.033
That's what I mentioned.

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:39.100
You could cancel that out.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.067
I wouldn't mind it at
all if you did.

00:05:41.067 --> 00:05:44.733
But I sometimes like to keep it
there just to remind myself

00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:46.433
of what that definition is.

00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:48.133
Either way would be fine.

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:50.300
It'd be perfectly fine
to cancel that out.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.900
Normally, concentration is
considered to be a quantity

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:54.933
that has no units.

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:57.567
But sometimes I like to keep it
there just as a reminder.

00:05:57.567 --> 00:05:58.067
Yeah?

00:05:58.067 --> 00:05:58.900
STUDENT: Why are the tens raised
to the fourth power?

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:59.033
Oh, it's meters.

00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:00.333
OK.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.000
PROFESSOR: Where are you
looking?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.967
STUDENT: The concentration
calculation.

00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:08.267
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:06:08.267 --> 00:06:09.067
Well, that's right.

00:06:09.067 --> 00:06:11.467
So this was 10 kilometers.

00:06:11.467 --> 00:06:13.833
And a kilometer is
a 1,000 meters.

00:06:13.833 --> 00:06:19.600
So the 10 times the 3 gives 4,
10 to the fourth meters.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.033
Yeah.

00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:22.767
STUDENT: What is L1
and L2 again?

00:06:22.767 --> 00:06:23.833
PROFESSOR: The horizontal

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:25.267
dimensions of the valley.

00:06:25.267 --> 00:06:27.233
STUDENT: Oh, so the area.

00:06:27.233 --> 00:06:30.533
PROFESSOR: Well the
product is the area of the

00:06:30.533 --> 00:06:35.167
valley, but the L1 is the
dimension in one direction, L2

00:06:35.167 --> 00:06:36.700
is the dimension in the
other direction.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.100
If you want to know the base
area of the valley,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.333
that's L1 times L2.

00:06:47.567 --> 00:06:49.833
Other questions?

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:50.300
Yes?

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.600
STUDENT: Where did you
get 10 to the third?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.033
PROFESSOR: 10 to the third?

00:06:54.033 --> 00:06:55.267
STUDENT: It's the mass of the
air below the inversion?

00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:01.667
PROFESSOR: Well the
mass of the air below the

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:03.433
inversion is what's in
the denominator here.

00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:07.767
It's the density of the air
times the volume of the air

00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:10.067
and the volume was given by that
product, which you see

00:07:10.067 --> 00:07:11.967
written out here.

00:07:11.967 --> 00:07:14.400
Yeah.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.233
It's good to get this one really
clear, because the next

00:07:16.233 --> 00:07:17.200
one is even tougher.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.833
So any other questions
on this one?

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:22.233
OK.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:26.700
So now we move to case two,
which is unconfined mixing.

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:31.333
We don't have this predetermined
valley in a nice

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:33.267
inversion in which
we know things

00:07:33.267 --> 00:07:36.167
are going to be trapped.

00:07:36.167 --> 00:07:38.467
We know how much pollutant
we're putting in--

00:07:38.467 --> 00:07:41.300
I'm going to use the same value
as I did here --but we

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.067
don't know into what volume
will it be mixed.

00:07:46.067 --> 00:07:48.200
But we're going to assume that
there's a certain amount of

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.567
turbulence in this atmosphere.

00:07:50.567 --> 00:07:56.067
The air is kind of mixing and
spinning and moving around a

00:07:56.067 --> 00:07:56.900
little bit.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.000
And we're going to define
something called the

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.333
dispersion coefficient which
will help us decide how fast

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:09.233
that added material will diffuse
or will disperse into

00:08:09.233 --> 00:08:10.600
the atmosphere.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.633
I'll call it capital K and it
has units of meters squared

00:08:14.633 --> 00:08:15.867
per second.

00:08:17.933 --> 00:08:22.500
And you can estimate a magnitude
for that quantity in

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.267
the following way.

00:08:23.267 --> 00:08:26.400
You can take a typical
turbulent velocity--

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.367
let's say there are eddies in
this room that are turning

00:08:29.367 --> 00:08:32.633
over and that air speed has a
certain value, let's say one

00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:34.367
meter per second.

00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:40.400
And a typical eddy size, maybe
the eddies are filling the

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.033
space between the floor
and the ceiling,

00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:45.833
that's about four meters.

00:08:45.833 --> 00:08:48.233
So if that were the case, if
the typical speed were one

00:08:48.233 --> 00:08:52.267
meter per second, and the eddy
size were four meters, that

00:08:52.267 --> 00:08:56.967
would give a dispersion
coefficient of four meters

00:08:56.967 --> 00:08:58.000
squared per second.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.100
It's simply that product.

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.800
See, that'll give you
the right units.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.033
That has meters per second.

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:04.633
This has meters.

00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:06.633
And so that's going to give
meters squared per second,

00:09:06.633 --> 00:09:09.000
when you take that product.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.433
So this is sometimes very
difficult to determine, what

00:09:12.433 --> 00:09:15.367
that dispersion coefficient is
going to be for a particular

00:09:15.367 --> 00:09:17.400
atmospheric application.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.167
But you can get a rough
estimate, if you can estimate

00:09:21.167 --> 00:09:24.767
the size of the eddies and the
speed at which those eddies

00:09:24.767 --> 00:09:28.967
are turning over in this
turbulent atmosphere.

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:31.800
Let's say somehow we
know what that is.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.800
Then how fast will that mix
things into the atmosphere?

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.500
If I have a point source sitting
on the ground, one

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.333
direction is as good as
any other direction.

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:47.333
It's going to mix to the left,
to the right, and up equally

00:09:47.333 --> 00:09:52.867
fast. So it's going to produce
a kind of hemisphere of

00:09:52.867 --> 00:09:58.333
pollutant, a half sphere that's
growing in time as that

00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:03.000
material diffuses outward
and upward.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.067
And the radius of that
hemisphere is given by this

00:10:06.067 --> 00:10:10.400
formula, the square root of
the dispersion coefficient

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.467
times time.

00:10:12.467 --> 00:10:18.300
So the longer you wait, the
larger that hemisphere will

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:24.133
be, and of course, the more
dilute will be the pollutant

00:10:24.133 --> 00:10:26.900
because you've put a fixed
amount of pollutant in, unless

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:28.033
you're continuing to add it.

00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:30.800
I'm assuming, the problem I'm
going to work out here, you

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.000
put in just a fixed amount of
pollutant and then gradually

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
you watch it dilute itself as
it mixes into a larger and

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.200
larger part of the atmosphere.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.433
So what does that say?

00:10:46.433 --> 00:10:50.267
It goes as a square
root of time.

00:10:50.267 --> 00:10:54.667
That function, the square root
function, increases rapidly at

00:10:54.667 --> 00:10:58.933
first and then more
slowly later on.

00:10:58.933 --> 00:11:02.167
And that is the nature of
turbulent dispersion.

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:06.900
Rapidly at first and then more
slowly later in time.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.500
And you may have had
that experience.

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.700
If you burn something in the
kitchen and you're right

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.733
there, you smell it
very quickly.

00:11:14.733 --> 00:11:18.333
A couple of meters away, it
takes a lot longer to get

00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:23.167
there and even further away even
longer, but not linearly.

00:11:23.167 --> 00:11:26.500
It actually gets slower
and slower and slower.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:32.800
The advance of that burned smell
moves slower and slower

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.000
as time progresses.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.900
So rapidly at first and then
more slowly later on describes

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:44.933
how things disperse away
from their source.

00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:46.800
So let's carry out this
example then.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.433
Let's say the dispersion
coefficient on this day is a

00:11:50.433 --> 00:11:56.533
100 meters squared per second
and that the time we're going

00:11:56.533 --> 00:11:59.367
to wait after the pollutant
was suddenly

00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:02.000
put in is 10 minutes.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Well, that's 600 seconds.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.333
So the first thing is to compute
the radius of that

00:12:07.333 --> 00:12:10.500
hemisphere that contains
the pollutant.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.867
It's the square root
of 100 times 600.

00:12:14.867 --> 00:12:19.000
And that's about 245 meters.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.100
By the way, check the
units on this.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.333
Is this going to give
you a length?

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:25.333
How can that be?

00:12:25.333 --> 00:12:29.667
Well, if I multiply this times
the time, the seconds are

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:31.433
going to cancel out.

00:12:31.433 --> 00:12:33.533
I'm going to have
meters squared

00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:36.400
inside the square root.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.233
Taking the square root, that
gives me units of meters.

00:12:39.233 --> 00:12:42.233
And that's just what I need to
be physically consistent with

00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:45.833
this quantity, R, which is the
radius of the hemisphere.

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:49.133
So these units work
out nicely.

00:12:49.133 --> 00:12:52.167
So the radius of that's going
to be 245 meters.

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:57.033
We want to know the volume or
the mass of the air into which

00:12:57.033 --> 00:12:59.500
the pollutant has spread.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:03.533
So I've written here the formula
for the air mass.

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:09.133
It's the density of the air,
rho, times the volume of half

00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:11.400
of a sphere.

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.367
You may recall the formula for
the volume of a sphere is 4/3

00:13:15.367 --> 00:13:16.600
pi r cubed.

00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:23.267
Well, I've taken half of that,
because this is a hemisphere.

00:13:23.267 --> 00:13:24.300
It's half of a sphere.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.567
So it's 2/3 pi r cubed.

00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:30.367
And I put the density in front,
so I get the mass of

00:13:30.367 --> 00:13:34.033
the air and it's 3.7 times 10
to the 7 kilograms. So what

00:13:34.033 --> 00:13:35.267
have I done?

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.500
I'm going to use the
same source here.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.900
I've mixed in 40 times 10 to
the third kilograms of

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:48.700
pollutant into 3.7 times 10 to
the seventh kilograms of air.

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.967
So the concentration is given
by that ratio and it's 1.1

00:13:52.967 --> 00:13:55.033
times 10 to the minus 3.

00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:58.733
Again, you could cancel that out
or you could say kilograms

00:13:58.733 --> 00:13:59.533
per kilogram.

00:13:59.533 --> 00:14:05.467
Kilogram of pollutant
per kilogram of air.

00:14:05.467 --> 00:14:05.867
Question?

00:14:05.867 --> 00:14:06.333
Yes.

00:14:06.333 --> 00:14:09.633
STUDENT: So you don't know the
radius of the hemisphere

00:14:09.633 --> 00:14:10.333
unless you know the dispersion
coefficient

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:12.967
and the time which--?

00:14:12.967 --> 00:14:14.200
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:14.900
It's right.

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.367
So unlike the valley case, where
we kind of knew from the

00:14:18.367 --> 00:14:22.833
initial dimensions of the
system, how big or how much

00:14:22.833 --> 00:14:27.233
the dilution will be, here we
have to estimate it based on

00:14:27.233 --> 00:14:30.100
the dispersion coefficient
and the time that's left.

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.667
Obviously, for longer times,
that's going to continue to

00:14:32.667 --> 00:14:35.200
grow and this concentration
is going to get less

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.333
and less and less.

00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:41.767
We haven't removed any
pollutant, but we've diluted

00:14:41.767 --> 00:14:45.600
it into a larger and larger
amount of air.

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.000
Yes?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.167
STUDENT: And so the
air density is not

00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:52.867
affected by the pollutant?

00:14:52.867 --> 00:14:54.133
PROFESSOR: No.

00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:57.433
I'm assuming that this is a
small amount of pollutant

00:14:57.433 --> 00:14:58.667
relative to the air.

00:14:58.667 --> 00:14:59.500
And so no.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:01.267
It doesn't change
the air density.

00:15:01.267 --> 00:15:04.200
It just mixes in with the air.

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.500
Yeah.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:06.867
Was there another question?

00:15:06.867 --> 00:15:07.133
Yes.

00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:09.067
STUDENT: So this only tells
you overall concentration

00:15:09.067 --> 00:15:13.367
rather than concentration within
the different smaller

00:15:13.367 --> 00:15:14.800
hemispheres it could go to?

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.933
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so

00:15:15.933 --> 00:15:16.867
that's a very good question.

00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:22.567
The question is this only tells
you what's going on

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:23.933
generally within that sphere.

00:15:23.933 --> 00:15:27.700
It doesn't give you details of
what's inside the sphere.

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:31.300
And of course, the model that
I've described here is not

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:32.600
precisely true.

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.267
If I were to plot concentration
across this

00:15:37.267 --> 00:15:39.867
distance, it would be
very small outside.

00:15:39.867 --> 00:15:43.433
It would begin to rise smoothly,
probably would be at

00:15:43.433 --> 00:15:45.500
maximum somewhere in
the middle, and

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.767
then decrease again.

00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:50.267
Whereas what I've indicated to
you, which is a little bit

00:15:50.267 --> 00:15:54.733
off, is if there would be
zero outside and uniform

00:15:54.733 --> 00:15:58.000
concentration inside and then
zero again outside.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.367
And that's not exactly true.

00:15:59.367 --> 00:16:02.567
So your vision of it
is actually more

00:16:02.567 --> 00:16:03.600
accurate than mine.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.200
It'd be more of a continuous
distribution, large closer to

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.667
the source, smaller
further away.

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:16.333
But this is an easy-to-compute
estimate of what those

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:17.733
concentrations would be.

00:16:17.733 --> 00:16:21.533
You would not have a sharp
boundary here with this

00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:24.300
concentration inside
and zero outside.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:27.133
It wouldn't be like that,
there'd be more of a gradual

00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:27.633
transition.

00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:28.433
So this is kind of an

00:16:28.433 --> 00:16:30.733
approximation to the real
condition.

00:16:30.733 --> 00:16:32.633
That's an excellent question.

00:16:32.633 --> 00:16:33.867
Other questions on this?

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:39.900
So there would be our
concentration

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.767
after time, 600 seconds.

00:16:42.767 --> 00:16:46.600
You could redo the computation
for a later time and you'd get

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:49.833
a larger value in the
denominator and therefore, a

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:52.300
smaller value of
concentration.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.533
That's the way dilution works.

00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:59.433
Anything else on this?

00:16:59.433 --> 00:16:59.767
OK.

00:16:59.767 --> 00:17:03.267
Now we're going to add another
element of complexity here.

00:17:03.267 --> 00:17:06.067
For case three, we're
going to add a wind.

00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:08.633
So there's a wind blowing
in this system.

00:17:08.633 --> 00:17:13.000
So it's unconfined, no
valley walls, but now

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.167
there's a wind blowing.

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:18.333
So I've drawn some little
cartoons here.

00:17:18.333 --> 00:17:21.433
There is the source.

00:17:21.433 --> 00:17:23.167
Maybe it's a-- what I'm
envisioning here is not just

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:26.867
an instantaneous release of
pollutant, like I was in case

00:17:26.867 --> 00:17:31.767
one and case two, but here I'm
envisioning a steady state

00:17:31.767 --> 00:17:34.900
source of pollution, like a
power plant that's putting out

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.767
a certain amount of smoke from
the stack per unit time

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:40.000
continuously.

00:17:42.467 --> 00:17:46.700
If I had a side view of that,
and the wind was blowing from

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.333
left to right, I would find
that pollutant would be

00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:51.700
confined in a kind of--

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:55.767
we call this a plume, a plume
of pollutant, moving

00:17:55.767 --> 00:18:00.800
downstream, getting deeper the
further it goes downstream due

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.200
to the turbulent mixing.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.633
If I had a top-view of
that same situation--

00:18:07.633 --> 00:18:10.467
here's the top-view -there's the
power plant, there's the

00:18:10.467 --> 00:18:12.967
source, the wind is from
left to right.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:15.967
Now we see that plume is
spreading in the horizontal

00:18:15.967 --> 00:18:20.600
dimensions as well, again
by turbulent mixing and

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.433
dispersion.

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:27.200
And if I was to slice this here
or here and look at it

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:31.033
along the direction of the
wind, at any particular

00:18:31.033 --> 00:18:36.933
distance downstream, x, it would
look like half a circle.

00:18:39.533 --> 00:18:43.267
And the radius of that circle
will be larger the further

00:18:43.267 --> 00:18:47.333
downwind that I go, because
dispersion is enlarging that

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:50.133
plume the further we get
from the source.

00:18:56.033 --> 00:18:58.033
So how are we going to
work this one out?

00:18:58.033 --> 00:19:02.600
Again, it's just a matter of
computing dilution, but now

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.967
this is a steady-state pollution
and we're going to

00:19:06.967 --> 00:19:10.167
have to take into account the
effect of wind moving that

00:19:10.167 --> 00:19:11.800
material downwind.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.367
So I wanted to define a transit
time, the time it

00:19:15.367 --> 00:19:21.867
takes the air to go from the
pollutant source to whatever x

00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:23.967
location we're interested in.

00:19:23.967 --> 00:19:27.767
Maybe your house is five
kilometers downwind of the

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:28.533
power plant.

00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:32.733
Well then, x is going to
be five kilometers.

00:19:32.733 --> 00:19:36.467
And the time it takes the air to
get from the power plant to

00:19:36.467 --> 00:19:40.233
your house is going to be x
divided by the wind speed.

00:19:40.233 --> 00:19:42.367
Wind speed is capital
U in this case.

00:19:42.367 --> 00:19:45.267
Notice that'll have the right
units, distance over a

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:47.333
distance per time.

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:49.267
That's going to work out
to have units of time.

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.367
The radius of this plume is
given by the same formula we

00:19:55.367 --> 00:20:02.667
had earlier, except now it's
this transit time we put in to

00:20:02.667 --> 00:20:05.100
that formula.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.400
It's a steady-state situation,
so it's not changing in time,

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.333
but yet there is this transit
time that plays the role of

00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:15.067
time in the original problem.

00:20:15.067 --> 00:20:19.000
So I'll put in x over t into
this formula and I get kx over

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.400
u square root for this quantity,
r, that you see in

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.200
each of these three diagrams.
Question, yes.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.867
STUDENT: What is U?

00:20:28.867 --> 00:20:32.567
PROFESSOR: U is the
wind speed, typically in

00:20:32.567 --> 00:20:33.800
meters per second.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.900
Now, by the way, the
cross-sectional area of this

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:43.767
plume, if I were to slice
across like this,

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:46.333
it is half a circle--

00:20:46.333 --> 00:20:49.067
and you know the area of the
circle is pi r squared --and

00:20:49.067 --> 00:20:53.300
so the plume cross-sectional
area is pi r squared divided

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.600
by two, because it's
half a circle.

00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:03.733
Now here comes probably the
trickiest part of the

00:21:03.733 --> 00:21:04.667
derivation.

00:21:04.667 --> 00:21:09.300
I'm going to assume that I know
the source strength and

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:13.033
that's how much pollutant is
being added to the air per

00:21:13.033 --> 00:21:15.167
unit time by the power plant.

00:21:15.167 --> 00:21:18.467
That might have units, for
example, of kilograms per

00:21:18.467 --> 00:21:23.167
second, kilograms of smoke,
let's say, being added to the

00:21:23.167 --> 00:21:26.200
atmosphere every second.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.033
Well, in a steady state, the
amount of pollutant being

00:21:30.033 --> 00:21:33.467
added at the source must be the
same amount that's being

00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:36.133
carried away by the wind.

00:21:36.133 --> 00:21:40.733
And so by equating those two, I
can derive a formula for the

00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:42.900
concentration.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.867
So this is the key step, I'm
going to equate the rate at

00:21:45.867 --> 00:21:48.467
which pollutant's being added
to the rate at which it's

00:21:48.467 --> 00:21:49.900
being carried away
by the wind.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.967
So on the left-hand side is a
rate which it's being added,

00:21:52.967 --> 00:21:54.133
this is the rate at
which it's being

00:21:54.133 --> 00:21:55.767
carried away by the wind.

00:21:55.767 --> 00:21:57.600
Let me go through this
right-hand side.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:22:00.400
That's the air density, that's
wind speed, that's the

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.867
cross-sectional area
of the plume.

00:22:04.867 --> 00:22:08.233
And so that product by itself,
those three things together,

00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:14.600
is the amount of air per unit
time passing a way within the

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.267
plume-- being carried downwind
by the wind.

00:22:18.267 --> 00:22:21.333
And I just have to multiply that
times the concentration

00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:23.433
to convert that from an
air mass flux to a

00:22:23.433 --> 00:22:27.400
pollutant air mass flux.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:32.733
So then solving this formula
for concentration, I get 2

00:22:32.733 --> 00:22:38.133
times the source, I've plugged
this in there as well, 2 times

00:22:38.133 --> 00:22:43.033
the source, divided by the
density of the air, divided by

00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:47.400
pi times k times x.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.667
And you're going to want to
leave an inch or two in your

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:54.500
notes to check the units
on this as well.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:59.833
For example, the units on the
concentration, we expect if

00:22:59.833 --> 00:23:03.233
previous calculations are
right, it'll be either

00:23:03.233 --> 00:23:06.300
kilograms per kilogram, if
you prefer, or it'll

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:09.133
have no units at all.

00:23:09.133 --> 00:23:12.533
And so all the units over
here should cancel out.

00:23:12.533 --> 00:23:18.100
And leave an inch or two of your
notes to deal with that.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:22.300
One very interesting thing is
that the velocity of the wind

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:24.533
canceled out.

00:23:24.533 --> 00:23:25.800
How did that happen?

00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:33.367
I had it here because the rate
at which material is being

00:23:33.367 --> 00:23:34.767
blown downwind is going to be

00:23:34.767 --> 00:23:37.033
proportional to the wind speed.

00:23:37.033 --> 00:23:45.367
But you see the radius here,
well the area, depends on r,

00:23:45.367 --> 00:23:48.033
and r depends on U underneath.

00:23:48.033 --> 00:23:50.600
So when you square the radius,
you get a U underneath, which

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.233
cancels that out.

00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:56.867
So the width of the plume will
change with the wind speed,

00:23:56.867 --> 00:23:59.800
but not the concentration
within the plume.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.267
And when you do--

00:24:01.267 --> 00:24:03.233
you're going to do a couple of
examples like this in your

00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:04.767
next problem set.

00:24:04.767 --> 00:24:08.067
When you're doing that, you
might spend a few minutes

00:24:08.067 --> 00:24:12.000
puzzling over what was the
role of the wind speed.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.533
The wind speed is very important
in this problem, but

00:24:14.533 --> 00:24:17.800
in that particular formula,
it is canceled out.

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.800
And so you should try to resolve
that little dilemma--

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.067
how, if the wind speed is
important, how did it cancel

00:24:25.067 --> 00:24:27.367
out in that particular
formula.

00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:33.000
So think a bit about how
that would work.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.800
Any questions on this?

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.100
Yes.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.000
STUDENT: What is A?

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.467
PROFESSOR: A is the--

00:24:38.467 --> 00:24:41.200
is this thing, the
cross-sectional area of the

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:43.967
plume, pi r squared over 2.

00:24:43.967 --> 00:24:44.433
Yes.

00:24:44.433 --> 00:24:46.667
STUDENT: What is the x in
the equation over there?

00:24:46.667 --> 00:24:50.367
PROFESSOR: X is
the distance between the

00:24:50.367 --> 00:24:55.500
source of the pollutant and the
location of interest: your

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.767
house or the school yard, where
the kids are playing, or

00:24:59.767 --> 00:25:02.433
whatever it is that you're
interested in finding out what

00:25:02.433 --> 00:25:03.867
the concentration is.

00:25:03.867 --> 00:25:08.467
It's the distance away from
the pollutant source.

00:25:08.467 --> 00:25:13.767
Now obviously, if the wind is
from the west and you're

00:25:13.767 --> 00:25:17.233
living down here somewhere, that
plume is not going to hit

00:25:17.233 --> 00:25:18.767
you at all.

00:25:18.767 --> 00:25:22.900
So this calculation is
irrelevant for you.

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:25.467
So the wind direction comes into
this in a very important

00:25:25.467 --> 00:25:28.333
way also, I haven't mentioned
that up until now, but it's

00:25:28.333 --> 00:25:31.233
probably quite obvious that the
wind direction is a key

00:25:31.233 --> 00:25:32.767
player in this.

00:25:32.767 --> 00:25:36.100
It's only if the wind is blowing
generally in the

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:40.400
direction from the source to
your location that this

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.200
calculation becomes relevant.

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:44.700
Yeah.

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:47.167
STUDENT: Does the plume
get wider as you go

00:25:47.167 --> 00:25:48.133
farther away from it?

00:25:48.133 --> 00:25:50.833
So if you live south of
it, far enough away--

00:25:50.833 --> 00:25:51.800
PROFESSOR: That's true.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.767
That's what I've sketched.

00:25:52.767 --> 00:25:54.767
This is a top view.

00:25:54.767 --> 00:25:57.767
It is getting wider, fast at
first, and then slower.

00:25:57.767 --> 00:26:00.467
But it never stops widening,
it keeps getting wider and

00:26:00.467 --> 00:26:03.067
wider and wider the further
you are downwind.

00:26:03.067 --> 00:26:03.667
So that's true.

00:26:03.667 --> 00:26:07.933
If you lived a great distance
downwind, but not in the

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:11.233
exactly in the wind direction,
you might still get the

00:26:11.233 --> 00:26:12.767
pollutant, because
the pollution

00:26:12.767 --> 00:26:15.067
will widen the plume.

00:26:15.067 --> 00:26:18.600
So keep track of that when you
do these calculations.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.000
Yes.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.333
STUDENT: What does
source represent

00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:21.733
in that final equation?

00:26:21.733 --> 00:26:24.200
PROFESSOR: Source
would be the rate at which

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.000
pollutant is being added to the
atmosphere at the power

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.100
plant, let's say.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.767
It could be in units of
kilograms per second.

00:26:32.767 --> 00:26:36.467
But if it's particles, it
could be the number of

00:26:36.467 --> 00:26:39.700
particles per second
that's being added.

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.100
And then your concentration
would have to be in the

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:43.100
appropriate--

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.633
by the way, that's the curve
ball I've given you the

00:26:45.633 --> 00:26:47.000
problem set.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.567
I think I gave you a problem in
which the source was quoted

00:26:51.567 --> 00:26:54.500
as a number of particles
per second.

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.133
And so the concentration then
was in units of particles per

00:26:59.133 --> 00:27:03.733
cubic meter, rather than
kilograms per cubic meter.

00:27:03.733 --> 00:27:05.567
So just be wary, you have
to have consistent

00:27:05.567 --> 00:27:10.100
units when you do this.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.833
OK, now we're going to leave
that there and move on to

00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:18.333
another aspect of mixing which
is very important also.

00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:21.833
And that's the role of the
temperature lapse rate.

00:27:25.033 --> 00:27:27.900
So I called this section lapse
rate and buoyancy effects.

00:27:30.433 --> 00:27:33.967
First of all, I want to define
what I mean by the lapse rate.

00:27:33.967 --> 00:27:35.833
Lapse rate is the rate
of change of

00:27:35.833 --> 00:27:38.100
temperature with height.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.333
If you launch a balloon and get
that data back, you can

00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:48.167
measure the values of
temperature with height and

00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:49.767
you can define the lapse rate.

00:27:49.767 --> 00:27:55.267
It has units typically of
degrees Celsius per meter or

00:27:55.267 --> 00:27:58.533
perhaps you would want to use
degrees Celsius per kilometer.

00:27:58.533 --> 00:28:02.133
It's basically how fast is the
temperature change in the

00:28:02.133 --> 00:28:04.567
atmosphere as you
go up and down.

00:28:04.567 --> 00:28:08.800
Typically, in the troposphere,
you remember, it gets colder

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.567
as you go up.

00:28:10.567 --> 00:28:13.233
And an average value--

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:18.133
I'm using lower gamma for this
--typical lapse rate for the

00:28:18.133 --> 00:28:25.133
troposphere is about 6.5 degrees
Celsius per kilometer.

00:28:25.133 --> 00:28:28.100
On average, every kilometer
you go up, it

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.767
cools about 6.5 degrees.

00:28:30.767 --> 00:28:32.067
But don't take that
too literally.

00:28:32.067 --> 00:28:33.067
That's just an average.

00:28:33.067 --> 00:28:36.700
Sometimes it's very different
than that,

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:39.067
sometimes it's even positive.

00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:40.633
For example, in an inversion--

00:28:40.633 --> 00:28:42.267
remember how I defined
an inversion?

00:28:42.267 --> 00:28:45.633
An inversion was a layer
where the temperature

00:28:45.633 --> 00:28:46.667
increases with height.

00:28:46.667 --> 00:28:50.333
Well, that would mean a positive
lapse rate, instead

00:28:50.333 --> 00:28:53.200
of a negative one.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.200
So for some layers-- and then in
the stratosphere, remember

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.533
you have a positive lapse rate,
the temperature gets

00:28:57.533 --> 00:29:01.000
warmer as you go up.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.633
The other really important
quantity is a more of a

00:29:03.633 --> 00:29:05.867
theoretical one, but it's
equally important.

00:29:05.867 --> 00:29:07.133
It's the adiabatic lapse rate.

00:29:09.733 --> 00:29:12.400
This is the lapse rate
that a parcel of air

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.700
experiences when it rises.

00:29:18.267 --> 00:29:21.033
Why would the temperature
of an air parcel

00:29:21.033 --> 00:29:23.133
change when it rises?

00:29:23.133 --> 00:29:24.100
Well, it's pretty--

00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.100
it's fairly straightforward.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.633
When you take an air parcel of a
certain volume and lift it--

00:29:30.633 --> 00:29:32.833
you know the pressure decreases
as you go up, so

00:29:32.833 --> 00:29:34.833
when you lift a parcel
up, it's going to

00:29:34.833 --> 00:29:36.800
expand a little bit.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.267
You lift it further, it's going
to expand still more.

00:29:40.267 --> 00:29:44.867
And when air expands, it does
work on its environment by

00:29:44.867 --> 00:29:47.767
pressing out and expanding.

00:29:47.767 --> 00:29:51.600
It decreases the amount of
energy stored in the parcel

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.767
because it's done work
on the environment.

00:29:54.767 --> 00:29:57.300
And its temperature drops.

00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.100
It's called adiabatic expansion

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:00.567
or adiabatic cooling.

00:30:00.567 --> 00:30:06.467
The word adiabatic here
means without adding

00:30:06.467 --> 00:30:09.267
or subtracting heat.

00:30:09.267 --> 00:30:12.033
And you may wonder, how can I
change the temperature without

00:30:12.033 --> 00:30:13.100
adding heat?

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:16.200
The point is I'm changing the
temperature by having that

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.333
parcel do work on its
environment, not by adding

00:30:20.333 --> 00:30:23.733
heat from some energy source.

00:30:23.733 --> 00:30:28.400
It's purely a mechanical process
of expanding the air

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:33.433
and watching it cool because of
that adiabatic expansion.

00:30:33.433 --> 00:30:35.533
That's quite a powerful
effect, as you'll

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:37.700
see in just a moment.

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.467
So the adiabatic lapse rate is
defined as a rate of cooling

00:30:40.467 --> 00:30:41.900
as an air parcel rises.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:46.833
It is a reversible phenomenon,
so if a parcel sinks back down

00:30:46.833 --> 00:30:51.000
in the atmosphere, it will
compress and its temperature

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.067
will increase at
the same rate.

00:30:57.567 --> 00:31:00.800
I'll use capital gamma
for this quantity,

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:03.700
adiabatic lapse rate.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:07.000
It can be computed as a ratio of
the acceleration of gravity

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.567
to the heat capacity
of the air.

00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:12.233
If this were a course on
thermodynamics, I would derive

00:31:12.233 --> 00:31:14.800
that for you.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.867
For the earth, and our
atmosphere made of air, the

00:31:19.867 --> 00:31:23.500
value is about minus 9.3
times [correction: 9.8]

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.233
10 to the minus 3 degrees
Celsius per meter or

00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:35.667
expressing that in kilometers,
it's about minus 9.8 degrees

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:37.033
Celsius per kilometer.

00:31:37.033 --> 00:31:37.467
Question.

00:31:37.467 --> 00:31:38.867
STUDENT: What's the
denominator again?

00:31:38.867 --> 00:31:40.733
PROFESSOR: The heat capacity of
constant

00:31:40.733 --> 00:31:44.067
pressure for air.

00:31:44.067 --> 00:31:48.867
You could look it up in a table
of physical constants.

00:31:48.867 --> 00:31:50.333
You can Google it.

00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:54.300
Its value is about a 1,004,
I believe, in SI units.

00:31:57.733 --> 00:32:01.700
So I have to confess, I'm a
little bit sloppy, that number

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:05.800
is so close to 10 that I very
often round it off to 10 when

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.600
I'm doing quick calculations.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.267
And I've done that here
in my little example.

00:32:11.267 --> 00:32:14.200
Let's say I've got air at sea
level that's at 10 degrees

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:18.000
Celsius and I move it up
in the atmosphere three

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.333
kilometers, 3,000 meters.

00:32:21.333 --> 00:32:23.900
What temperature will
it be at when it

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.500
reaches that higher elevation?

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.733
Well, if I round that off to
10, it's cooling 10 degrees

00:32:29.733 --> 00:32:33.900
for every kilometer that I lift
it, so it's going to cool

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:38.600
by 30 degrees Celsius,
approximately.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.400
Please, I would ask you not
to do that rounding.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:46.033
In your problem sets, let
it be 9.8, not 10.

00:32:46.033 --> 00:32:48.267
But for the purposes of
illustration, it's going to

00:32:48.267 --> 00:32:54.067
cool by approximately
30 degrees Celsius.

00:32:54.067 --> 00:32:58.467
It starts at 10, so it's going
to be minus 20 Celsius when it

00:32:58.467 --> 00:33:02.633
gets to 3 kilometers.

00:33:02.633 --> 00:33:04.467
You can do that in Kelvins
as well, it will work

00:33:04.467 --> 00:33:04.967
out the same way.

00:33:04.967 --> 00:33:06.333
If it starts at--

00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:10.167
let's see if it's 10 degrees
Celsius, that's going to be

00:33:10.167 --> 00:33:17.233
283 Kelvins, and subtract 30
from that, it's going to be

00:33:17.233 --> 00:33:20.900
253 Kelvins when it
gets up there.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:23.867
So you might want to put both
the Celsius and the Kelvins in

00:33:23.867 --> 00:33:26.933
your notes to be sure you're
clear on that question.

00:33:26.933 --> 00:33:28.533
STUDENT: So that first one
there is it's shown as

00:33:28.533 --> 00:33:30.267
expanded in that diagram?

00:33:30.267 --> 00:33:31.233
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:33:31.233 --> 00:33:34.033
I've drawn it that way to remind
you that the reason

00:33:34.033 --> 00:33:36.600
it's cooled is because
it has expanded.

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.400
It moved into a region where
the pressure was less and

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.067
therefore, it naturally expanded
because of that

00:33:43.067 --> 00:33:44.533
lowered pressure.

00:33:44.533 --> 00:33:45.000
Question.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.233
STUDENT: So it doesn't matter
the size of the air parcel?

00:33:47.233 --> 00:33:47.967
PROFESSOR: No.

00:33:47.967 --> 00:33:49.300
So it's so simple.

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:52.967
It doesn't matter the size of
the parcel, it's just that

00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:54.700
elevation difference is
all that matters.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.500
That tells you how much, on
a relative basis, it has

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.533
expanded, and therefore,
how many degrees

00:34:00.533 --> 00:34:03.400
Celsius it has cooled.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.400
Now remember I said this
is reversible.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.733
If I take that parcel and move
it back down, it'll compress

00:34:08.733 --> 00:34:12.200
back down to its original
volume, and it'll return to

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.633
its original temperature.

00:34:14.633 --> 00:34:16.600
So it's a reversible process.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:17.833
STUDENT: Are you assuming the
parcel was on the ground?

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.700
PROFESSOR: The question is
whether we're

00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.033
assuming it was on the ground.

00:34:24.033 --> 00:34:25.667
No, not necessarily.

00:34:25.667 --> 00:34:28.800
This would happen, I could start
at any elevation and

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.367
move it to any other
elevation.

00:34:31.367 --> 00:34:33.767
So this is independent of
where the ground was.

00:34:33.767 --> 00:34:36.933
I just happened to give you an
example with the ground.

00:34:36.933 --> 00:34:39.667
Just a three kilometer lifting,
no matter where you

00:34:39.667 --> 00:34:43.867
started, would give you an
approximate 330 degrees

00:34:43.867 --> 00:34:45.133
Celsius cooling.

00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.167
Questions on that?

00:34:52.167 --> 00:34:52.567
OK.

00:34:52.567 --> 00:34:57.133
Now, we can begin to do some
calculations then of what

00:34:57.133 --> 00:35:00.200
happens to air as you move it up
and down in the atmosphere.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:05.000
Using these two concepts, the
measured lapse rate and the

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.233
adiabatic lapse rate.

00:35:06.233 --> 00:35:09.900
So normally in the textbooks,
you'll see diagrams like this,

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.667
where the temperatures have
been put on the x-axis,

00:35:12.667 --> 00:35:17.100
altitude's been put on the
y-axis, and some reference

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:19.800
lines are drawn on here,
where the slope,

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.267
given by capital gamma.

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.700
And then I've drawn in a black
curve, which represents the

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:32.600
actual lapse rate on the day,
under consideration.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.500
Let's say we've launched a
balloon, measured temperature

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.333
as a function of height, and
I've plotted that up as that

00:35:39.333 --> 00:35:40.733
black line.

00:35:40.733 --> 00:35:43.033
Now, the question is what's
going to happen to an air

00:35:43.033 --> 00:35:47.033
parcel as it's moved upwards
or downwards in

00:35:47.033 --> 00:35:48.300
this kind of a situation.

00:35:51.167 --> 00:36:02.467
If I take an air parcel from
this elevation and lift it,

00:36:02.467 --> 00:36:04.833
it's going to cool.

00:36:04.833 --> 00:36:09.400
It's going to cool moving along
the dashed blue curves,

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.867
because that's the adiabatic
lapse rate.

00:36:10.867 --> 00:36:13.967
So this parcel, when I take it
out of its environment and

00:36:13.967 --> 00:36:17.467
lift it a little ways, it's
going to move along like this

00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:18.733
to its new elevation.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.067
Its new temperature is going
to be there and the

00:36:24.067 --> 00:36:26.500
temperature of its
new environment

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.267
is going to be there.

00:36:29.267 --> 00:36:31.367
Here's the tricky part
of this argument.

00:36:31.367 --> 00:36:34.933
When you take an air parcel and
lift it, it's cooling at

00:36:34.933 --> 00:36:42.233
one rate, its environment is
changing at a different rate.

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:44.600
And we're interested in knowing,
after we lift it a

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.667
certain amount, what is its
temperature relative to the

00:36:47.667 --> 00:36:48.700
environment?

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.733
It's new, the air that
it's now next to.

00:36:52.733 --> 00:36:58.933
In this case, the parcel went to
that temperature, it moved

00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:01.767
into cooler air above,
but that wasn't

00:37:01.767 --> 00:37:02.600
such a great effect.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:07.033
And actually, the parcel is
now colder than its new

00:37:07.033 --> 00:37:09.133
environment.

00:37:09.133 --> 00:37:12.533
Environment cooled, the parcel
cooled, the parcel cooled

00:37:12.533 --> 00:37:16.767
more, so the parcel is now
cold, relative to its new

00:37:16.767 --> 00:37:17.367
environment.

00:37:17.367 --> 00:37:20.633
What's going to happen
to that parcel?

00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:23.767
It's going to sink because
it's more dense than its

00:37:23.767 --> 00:37:24.733
environment.

00:37:24.733 --> 00:37:28.300
So I lifted it up there, it
looks around and says, oh my

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.233
lord, I am dense than
everything up

00:37:31.233 --> 00:37:32.967
here, back down I go.

00:37:32.967 --> 00:37:34.700
I don't belong here
in this crowd.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.467
I've got to go back, I'm
negatively buoyant, I'm heavy,

00:37:38.467 --> 00:37:40.733
I'm going to sink back.

00:37:40.733 --> 00:37:41.433
You can repeat it.

00:37:41.433 --> 00:37:44.533
You could push that parcel down
in the atmosphere, it'll

00:37:44.533 --> 00:37:46.200
move to here.

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.967
There's a new temperature.

00:37:47.967 --> 00:37:50.167
There is a new temperature
of its environment.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.333
It got warmer, as
it went down.

00:37:56.333 --> 00:38:00.633
The environment got warmer too,
but it got warmer faster.

00:38:00.633 --> 00:38:03.233
Therefore, it's warmer than
its new environment.

00:38:03.233 --> 00:38:05.000
It's now buoyant.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.033
It's going to want to bob back
up to its original condition.

00:38:09.033 --> 00:38:12.833
This is called a stable
atmosphere.

00:38:12.833 --> 00:38:15.300
This term is very important,
this is called a stable

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:20.233
atmosphere because a parcel that
is lifted upwards wants

00:38:20.233 --> 00:38:22.933
to sink back down, a parcel
that's pushed down wants to

00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:25.033
bob back up.

00:38:25.033 --> 00:38:29.233
And the atmosphere is usually in
this state, but not always.

00:38:31.967 --> 00:38:37.867
I want to look at this second
example, here, which is again,

00:38:37.867 --> 00:38:40.333
temperature plotted
versus altitude.

00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:42.867
The same reference lines
have been drawn on

00:38:42.867 --> 00:38:44.733
here for capital gamma.

00:38:44.733 --> 00:38:49.700
But I put a different actual
lapse rate on that curve.

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.467
It's a lapse rate where
the temperature

00:38:52.467 --> 00:38:55.700
increases with height.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.067
This is an example
of an inversion.

00:39:04.067 --> 00:39:11.200
If I take a parcel from here and
lift it, it gets colder.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.200
I'm going to take it from that

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:15.267
elevation up to that elevation.

00:39:15.267 --> 00:39:17.633
There's the parcel
temperature.

00:39:17.633 --> 00:39:20.233
It's actually been moving into
warmer air, however.

00:39:22.767 --> 00:39:26.167
So the new environment
is there.

00:39:26.167 --> 00:39:30.433
So this is an extreme example
of stability.

00:39:30.433 --> 00:39:34.500
This is a very stable
environment where the parcel

00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:37.500
gets colder as you go up, the
environment gets warmer.

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:41.467
And so you develop these
restoring forces, this

00:39:41.467 --> 00:39:44.767
tendency for the parcel to want
to quickly remove, go

00:39:44.767 --> 00:39:50.600
back to where it was, are
amplified, in this case,

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.300
because of the inversion.

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:57.167
That's the reason why air cannot
mix effectively through

00:39:57.167 --> 00:39:58.700
an inversion.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.667
Because the air parcels want to
cool as they rise, and yet

00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:07.400
there's warmer air aloft, the
two things add to each other,

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.100
making it virtually impossible
for air parcels to mix upwards

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.833
or downwards, for that matter.

00:40:12.833 --> 00:40:17.933
The air tends to lay in stable
layers, stratified stable

00:40:17.933 --> 00:40:23.667
layers with very little
turbulent mixing in a

00:40:23.667 --> 00:40:24.967
situation like this.

00:40:24.967 --> 00:40:29.000
Now the situation that I didn't
do, and you can fill in

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.333
your notes, do one last
case where now--

00:40:32.333 --> 00:40:37.967
tilt this curve over so
it's flatter than

00:40:37.967 --> 00:40:40.733
the reference curves.

00:40:40.733 --> 00:40:42.967
Leave some space in your
notes for this.

00:40:42.967 --> 00:40:46.167
Take that observed temperature,
the black line,

00:40:46.167 --> 00:40:51.500
rotate it over until it's more
horizontal than the blue

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.533
reference lines.

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:54.900
And then repeat the argument.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:57.067
What you're going to find there
is it if you look to

00:40:57.067 --> 00:41:01.567
parcel, it suddenly becomes
buoyant relative to its

00:41:01.567 --> 00:41:04.633
environment and it'll
continue to rise.

00:41:04.633 --> 00:41:06.367
That's called an unstable
atmosphere.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:11.267
Same thing would happen
if you pushed it down.

00:41:11.267 --> 00:41:15.400
It would become negatively
buoyant and it would then drop

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.400
further, another illustration
that it's an unstable

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.900
atmosphere.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.033
So this sort of thing will
have a big impact on how

00:41:24.033 --> 00:41:26.933
materials mix around
in the atmosphere.

00:41:26.933 --> 00:41:30.533
And as we will see next time,
it also has a big impact on

00:41:30.533 --> 00:41:31.967
how clouds develop.

00:41:31.967 --> 00:41:36.033
Next week, we're going to get
into the issue of water vapor

00:41:36.033 --> 00:41:39.233
in the atmosphere,
how clouds form.

00:41:39.233 --> 00:41:43.567
And then by Wednesday or so, how
precipitation forms in the

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:44.700
atmosphere.

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:47.000
And I think we'll call
it quits today.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.700
But that will be the subject
for next week.

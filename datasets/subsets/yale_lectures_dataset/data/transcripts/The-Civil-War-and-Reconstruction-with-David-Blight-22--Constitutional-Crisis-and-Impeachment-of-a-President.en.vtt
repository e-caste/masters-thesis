00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.215
Professor David Blight:
I was in a meeting some

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.697
months ago of the New York
Historical Society's Board of

00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:23.479
Trustees;
august, wonderful group of

00:00:23.479 --> 00:00:26.244
people.
That's about thirty-five very

00:00:26.244 --> 00:00:30.081
rich New Yorkers and two token
historians, and I'm one of the

00:00:30.081 --> 00:00:34.236
token historians.
They have us there for window

00:00:34.236 --> 00:00:39.790
dressing, and other good and
useful and noble purposes.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.670
And during a discussion of a
subject I won't even go into,

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.892
one of the very intelligent and
very dedicated members of that

00:00:49.892 --> 00:00:54.259
board--and I'm not being
ironic--said that he really

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:59.910
wished American history could be
about "people of goodwill."

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.219
He wished American history
wasn't so full of conflict.

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:12.525
In effect, he was asking "why
can't we really just tell the

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:16.439
stories about people of
goodwill?"

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:24.920
And I remember thinking,
"Oh dear, this poor man."

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.000
But of course I didn't say
anything, kept my mouth shut.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.836
I nearly threw up,
and I just went home,

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:39.947
about my business.
But why can't history just be

00:01:39.947 --> 00:01:40.950
about people of goodwill?

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.050
I'll leave that to you,
to figure out.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.683
Sometimes there is a great deal
of goodwill and sometimes there

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:59.833
isn't.
Now, Reconstruction is a

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:05.590
classic story of--we've said
this already--great change,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.665
great experimentation,
change forced upon people in

00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:14.311
some ways--as we'll see with the
Fourteenth Amendment in a

00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:18.794
moment--and yet enough of a
cadre of leadership accepted

00:02:18.794 --> 00:02:23.439
that challenge and rewrote the
country you live in.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.575
And yet, of course,
like all great change,

00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:33.122
it caused a tremendous--and if
there's a Newton's Law of

00:02:33.122 --> 00:02:37.560
history--an opposite and equal
reaction.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.017
Revolutions always cause
counter-revolutions,

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:43.667
just count on it.
Look throughout American

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.456
History just for a moment.
Let's play some games of

00:02:47.456 --> 00:02:51.289
historical cycles just for a
moment.

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.578
Think of the greatest,
take your pick,

00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:56.979
the greatest fundamental
changes in American History,

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:00.967
whether that's in society,
the law, politics,

00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:05.952
massive immigration that
changed the demographics of the

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:09.800
country--take your pick,
but pick three or four of the

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.969
greatest moments of change in
American History.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:14.780
Every one of them caused a
counter-change.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.199
Every revolution we have causes
a counter-revolution.

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.207
You grew up reaping the great
changes of the Civil Rights

00:03:25.207 --> 00:03:29.724
Revolution.
You take them for granted,

00:03:29.724 --> 00:03:34.458
most of us do.
But you also came of age in the

00:03:34.458 --> 00:03:38.430
midst of the counter-revolution
against it.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.538
If you experienced the Civil
War and Reconstruction in

00:03:42.538 --> 00:03:45.639
America, you experienced a
revolution,

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:51.965
in many ways perhaps even more
fundamental, than the one in the

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:56.729
'60's and '70s,
and you experienced very

00:03:56.729 --> 00:04:03.013
quickly its counter-revolution.
Now, I just want to say that

00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:06.860
because the more you read about
Reconstruction,

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.430
the more it seems to me you
find serious writers on

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.430
Reconstruction,
historians or otherwise,

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.789
and not a lot of popular
writers and journalists have

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:18.426
discovered Reconstruction.
We're going to read a book by

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:20.594
one of them, Nick Lemann,
who's the Dean of the

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:24.618
Journalism School at Columbia,
who in quite good ways fashions

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:27.825
himself a historian.
He always says he's not a real

00:04:27.825 --> 00:04:29.617
historian,
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah,

00:04:29.617 --> 00:04:32.740
but he did pretty good research
for this book on violence,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.692
largely in Mississippi in 1875,
but he's using it as a window

00:04:37.692 --> 00:04:42.810
into the counter-revolution
you're soon to be reading about.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.695
But most people who write about
this period now tend to do it in

00:04:47.695 --> 00:04:53.565
tones of a kind of a requiem;
a requiem, a tragic mode,

00:04:53.565 --> 00:05:00.357
a mode that is always saying
what might have been,

00:05:00.357 --> 00:05:05.625
what was attempted,
what was aimed for,

00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:10.199
but then failed,
fell apart;

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:16.037
what high aspiration,
but God they couldn't quite do

00:05:16.037 --> 00:05:20.061
it.
And it is a national requiem,

00:05:20.061 --> 00:05:23.697
in a sense.
Somebody should write that

00:05:23.697 --> 00:05:27.009
symphony, the Reconstruction
Symphony.

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.629
We need a Beethoven for that,
and he needs to be really

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:31.970
depressed one day.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.678
But that doesn't mean it won't
be great and we won't learn from

00:05:39.678 --> 00:05:46.430
it, feel from it.
All right, back on the ground.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.844
I got in some cheap shots on
Andrew Johnson before we left

00:05:50.844 --> 00:05:53.400
the other day,
and they were that,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.860
cheap shots;
no apologies.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.970
But Andrew Johnson's,
of course, a key player here.

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.038
He comes to the presidency
because he's Lincoln's running

00:06:04.038 --> 00:06:07.107
mate, he and his office saying
he's going to make treason

00:06:07.107 --> 00:06:09.473
odious.
And some Radical Republicans

00:06:09.473 --> 00:06:12.245
were quite fond,
initially, of that approach,

00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:14.208
but it quickly,
quickly changed,

00:06:14.208 --> 00:06:16.953
and here in a nutshell--you've
read this now in Foner,

00:06:16.953 --> 00:06:20.319
you've all gotten up through at
least the first four chapters.

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.808
And by the way,
I've now visited at least three

00:06:22.808 --> 00:06:27.202
sections, and I'm enjoying it.
I wish they weren't just 50

00:06:27.202 --> 00:06:30.132
minutes.
You just get going and--of

00:06:30.132 --> 00:06:34.924
course this just gets going and
then--you're glad we're out of

00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:38.660
here in 50 minutes I'm sure.
But back to Andrew Johnson.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.250
He was, above all else,
an ardent States' Rightist.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.784
He did not support Secession.
Now you can be a States'

00:06:47.784 --> 00:06:50.892
Rightist, you can believe that
power should always remain in

00:06:50.892 --> 00:06:53.999
the hands of the state and still
not believe in the right of

00:06:53.999 --> 00:06:57.180
Secession.
And he was one of those.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.360
He believed secession was
political suicide for the South,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.439
and lo and behold he got that
one right.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:07.160
He had a strong attachment to
the American Union.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:12.250
He was a Unionist,
and a patriot in that sense.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.154
He had a hatred also of the
Southern planter class because

00:07:15.154 --> 00:07:18.750
he didn't grow up in it.
He was a poor boy who made good;

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:24.500
had a huge chip on his shoulder.
He was brilliant at a certain

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:28.164
kind of politics,
which was East Tennessee stump

00:07:28.164 --> 00:07:29.925
politics.
Andrew Johnson,

00:07:29.925 --> 00:07:32.292
it was said,
could crawl up on the back of a

00:07:32.292 --> 00:07:35.760
wagon and hold an audience for
two hours, in East Tennessee.

00:07:39.069 --> 00:07:43.659
He didn't very easily convert
that style and that talent at

00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:48.243
local stump politics,
however, to the much broader

00:07:48.243 --> 00:07:54.560
world of pragmatic negotiation
of Washington or the presidency.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.509
He'd held every kind of office
you could hold.

00:07:56.509 --> 00:07:59.670
He'd been mayor of Greenville,
Tennessee;

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:03.880
he'd been a state senator or
state legislator;

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.388
he'd been governor of Tennessee.
He was then elected Senator

00:08:07.388 --> 00:08:10.604
from Tennessee and then once
again appointed the wartime

00:08:10.604 --> 00:08:14.580
Governor of Tennessee by Abraham
Lincoln in the midst of the war.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:21.980
He'd held every level of office.
He'd never been anti-slavery.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:28.054
He saw the end of slavery as a
misfortune for the South,

00:08:28.054 --> 00:08:34.240
something that had to be
accepted as a verdict of war.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.806
But Johnson had one essential
slogan for his approach to

00:08:38.806 --> 00:08:42.376
Reconstruction,
and if you can remember that

00:08:42.376 --> 00:08:46.030
slogan you in essence have his
point of view:

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.679
the Constitution as it is and
the Union as it was.

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:54.420
The Constitution as it is and
the Union as it was.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.925
Don't revise the Constitution.
He would accept the Thirteenth

00:08:58.925 --> 00:09:01.455
Amendment, the end of slavery,
because that's part of the

00:09:01.455 --> 00:09:03.923
verdict of the war,
there wasn't any way around

00:09:03.923 --> 00:09:06.925
that, but he never accepted the
Fourteenth and Fifteenth

00:09:06.925 --> 00:09:09.992
Amendments,
and he worked vehemently to

00:09:09.992 --> 00:09:14.597
destroy the Fourteenth
Amendment, or at least he worked

00:09:14.597 --> 00:09:18.520
vehemently to urge states not to
ratify it.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.217
Now, his approach to
Reconstruction,

00:09:24.217 --> 00:09:26.600
once in office,
was essentially this.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.170
He took Lincoln's lenient plan,
The Ten Percent Plan,

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:35.389
and he went another step
further in its leniency,

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:38.730
or some say several steps
further.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.660
Instead of saying he wanted ten
percent of the voting population

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.779
of the Confederate states to
take loyalty oaths,

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:48.108
form a government,
come back and so forth,

00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:50.210
he simply converted ten percent
to,

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:55.340
quote, "that portion who are
loyal."

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.450
Any portion,
wherever may be two or more are

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.370
gathered, will have a loyal
government;

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:10.250
that portion who are loyal.
Now, he added one exception to

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.435
the pardons, however.
You remember people were going

00:10:14.435 --> 00:10:16.982
to get pardoned,
lieutenant and above,

00:10:16.982 --> 00:10:20.287
and so forth--I mean,
lieutenant and below in the

00:10:20.287 --> 00:10:23.728
Confederate forces.
He added one exception to the

00:10:23.728 --> 00:10:27.490
pardons, and this reflected a
very personal interest of his.

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:30.525
He would not pardon,
he said at first at least,

00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:34.155
any Southerner who owned
$20,000.00 worth of property or

00:10:34.155 --> 00:10:37.580
more.
It seemed like a class appeal.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.971
Nobody who owned $20,000.00--
the planter class,

00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:42.261
in other words,
was not going to get a pardon,

00:10:42.261 --> 00:10:44.450
no matter what they did during
the war;

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.091
if they were rich they weren't
going to be pardoned,

00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:51.090
well at least until they
applied for it,

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.470
and the application had to be
personal to the President of the

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:59.966
United States.
Now, this set in motion,

00:10:59.966 --> 00:11:07.326
in 1865, a bizarre process.
He promised clemency but only

00:11:07.326 --> 00:11:14.238
after they made formal written
applications about their new

00:11:14.238 --> 00:11:17.725
loyalty.
And what literally occurred,

00:11:17.725 --> 00:11:21.765
by the end of 1865 and
especially in the first months

00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:25.234
of 1866,
is lines formed at the White

00:11:25.234 --> 00:11:28.409
House in Washington,
often women.

00:11:28.409 --> 00:11:32.286
Southern women came to--lines
outdoors, on a daily basis at

00:11:32.286 --> 00:11:35.894
times--with their written
applications for clemency and

00:11:35.894 --> 00:11:38.679
pardon,
for participation in the

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:43.464
Confederate war effort.
After one year of this process,

00:11:43.464 --> 00:11:47.169
by May 1866,
Johnson himself had personally

00:11:47.169 --> 00:11:50.742
signed 7000 such pardons.
He wanted to make them grovel,

00:11:50.742 --> 00:11:51.330
in other words.

00:11:54.509 --> 00:12:00.980
Not a wise policy,
but a policy nonetheless.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.259
He did put in place,
or tried, some so-called

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:06.770
Johnson governments.
Now instead of calling them

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.769
Lincoln governments they would
be called Johnson governments.

00:12:08.769 --> 00:12:11.293
And the reason Johnson could
get away with this,

00:12:11.293 --> 00:12:13.710
of course, as you should know
from reading,

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.873
is that Congress went out of
session in the summer of

00:12:17.873 --> 00:12:21.556
1865--for months,
they went out of session--and

00:12:21.556 --> 00:12:25.000
Johnson had largely a free hand
to act,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.156
and did he ever.
By December of '65,

00:12:30.156 --> 00:12:34.763
when a new Congress would
reconvene in Washington,

00:12:34.763 --> 00:12:38.899
all the states in the former
Confederacy,

00:12:38.899 --> 00:12:42.607
except Texas,
had met the simplest of

00:12:42.607 --> 00:12:47.549
criteria, had written new state
constitutions,

00:12:47.549 --> 00:12:52.799
had found "that portion who are
loyal" to form a new government.

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:55.210
And it was very tiny
proportions in some places.

00:12:55.210 --> 00:13:01.450
In fact, there were no loyalty
oaths, even applied to people.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.812
All but one state,
Texas, was ready for

00:13:04.812 --> 00:13:09.768
readmission to the Union,
under this--what actually Foner

00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:15.548
calls it in his book--quote,
"amazing leniency of Andrew

00:13:15.548 --> 00:13:19.502
Johnson."
The only major demand put upon

00:13:19.502 --> 00:13:24.559
them was to formally nullify
their Act of Secession.

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:29.210
That's basically all they had
to do.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:31.965
Now, these were whites-only
governments, these were

00:13:31.965 --> 00:13:34.389
governments formed by former
Confederates,

00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:38.141
and in many of these states,
of course, they began to

00:13:38.141 --> 00:13:41.460
rapidly, in the late
summer/early fall 1865,

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.759
pass what became quickly known
as the Black Codes.

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:48.071
You've actually got a portion
of the Virginia Black Codes in

00:13:48.071 --> 00:13:51.560
the Gienapp reader.
Three or four of those laws are

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.509
there in your reader;
read them, with some care.

00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:58.710
These Black Codes mirrored the
old Slave Codes.

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.340
They explicitly denied the
right to vote to blacks,

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:04.181
the right to serve on juries,
the right to hold office,

00:14:04.181 --> 00:14:07.729
the right to own property.
There were all kinds of

00:14:07.729 --> 00:14:10.639
restrictive vagrancy laws
passed;

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:13.839
pass laws passed,
where blacks could be at any

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:17.110
given point in time,
with or without a pass.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:22.129
And in this newly reconstructed
Johnson approach to these

00:14:22.129 --> 00:14:27.508
states, there was a great deal
of legislation already flowing

00:14:27.508 --> 00:14:32.707
from some of these new state
legislatures meant to directly

00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:37.100
obstruct the work of the
Freedmen's Bureau.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.016
The counter-revolution folks
began almost as soon as the war

00:14:41.016 --> 00:14:44.468
was over, as soon as
ex-Confederates could find their

00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:49.970
way into power.
And did they ever.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:53.938
Part of what went on here in
the Northern mind--now let's

00:14:53.938 --> 00:14:58.332
remember, the blood of the war
is not entirely dry--but part of

00:14:58.332 --> 00:15:02.371
what was simply going on here in
the Northern mind as they

00:15:02.371 --> 00:15:05.428
witnessed this,
and as these new states now

00:15:05.428 --> 00:15:09.029
sent their representatives and
senators, after Fall election,

00:15:09.029 --> 00:15:14.131
back to Washington,
some of them literally wearing

00:15:14.131 --> 00:15:18.969
their Confederate uniforms.
And from Georgia came no less

00:15:18.969 --> 00:15:21.541
than as the new U.S.
Senator from Georgia,

00:15:21.541 --> 00:15:23.110
Alexander H.
Stephens.

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:25.510
A year ago he was the
Vice-President of the

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.941
Confederacy who had spent six
months in a Charlestown jail in

00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:32.011
Massachusetts,
allegedly arrested for his

00:15:32.011 --> 00:15:35.860
treason against the United
States, but released.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.354
And as they began to arrive in
Washington, it was this kind of

00:15:43.354 --> 00:15:47.099
insolence on the part of
ex-Confederates that in some

00:15:47.099 --> 00:15:50.557
ways began to stimulate what we
will call Radical

00:15:50.557 --> 00:15:53.804
Reconstruction.
Radical Reconstruction is a

00:15:53.804 --> 00:15:55.750
plan.
And Foner's right on that.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:59.722
He said one of the reasons that
this cadre of Republicans

00:15:59.722 --> 00:16:03.340
succeeded is because they really
did have a plan.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.794
If there's a revolution going
on and something's got to be

00:16:06.794 --> 00:16:10.370
redone about your country,
go to the meeting with a plan.

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:13.308
James Madison did that,
by the way, at the original

00:16:13.308 --> 00:16:16.541
drafting of the Constitution,
and he got most of what he

00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:18.297
took.
But they came back to

00:16:18.297 --> 00:16:21.162
Washington with ex-Confederate
generals, colonels,

00:16:21.162 --> 00:16:24.436
members of the Confederate
Cabinet and the Vice-President

00:16:24.436 --> 00:16:28.154
of the Confederacy.
Jeff Davis couldn't get elected

00:16:28.154 --> 00:16:32.260
in Mississippi yet because Jeff
Davis was still the only

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.678
ex-Confederate still in jail.
He will never be formally

00:16:36.678 --> 00:16:40.625
indicted.
He spent two years at Fortress

00:16:40.625 --> 00:16:44.179
Monroe, in a prison,
in Virginia.

00:16:44.179 --> 00:16:48.008
Tremendous mythology has gone
around that story that he wasn't

00:16:48.008 --> 00:16:50.090
fed properly,
that he was mistreated,

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.669
that he got ill and wasn't
given medical attention,

00:16:52.669 --> 00:16:55.509
virtually all of which is
nonsense.

00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:58.960
He wasn't terribly well at
times but it wasn't because he

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.646
didn't get medical attention.
By the time the United States

00:17:02.646 --> 00:17:06.320
Government, under the Johnson
Administration--in fact Johnson

00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.179
wanted absolutely nothing to do
with trying Jefferson Davis--but

00:17:10.179 --> 00:17:14.037
by the time they even got around
to finally formally considering

00:17:14.037 --> 00:17:17.734
it,
they had wasted so much time

00:17:17.734 --> 00:17:23.903
that Jefferson Davis will
finally be formally released in

00:17:23.903 --> 00:17:28.530
the spring--April to be
exact--of 1867,

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.849
two years after his arrest.
And just to show you the

00:17:32.849 --> 00:17:36.630
harbingers of reconciliation in
the political culture,

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.447
the people who paid his bail
were all Northerners,

00:17:41.447 --> 00:17:45.150
some of them quite famous.
Horace Greeley,

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:49.013
the great editor of the New
York Herald-Tribune and the

00:17:49.013 --> 00:17:51.846
former abolitionist,
although a strange and

00:17:51.846 --> 00:17:54.975
mercurial character by now,
put up the most amount,

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:58.166
and none other than Garret
Smith--the former radical

00:17:58.166 --> 00:18:00.670
abolitionist from upstate New
York,

00:18:00.670 --> 00:18:05.226
who checked himself into an
insane asylum after John Brown's

00:18:05.226 --> 00:18:08.470
raid--paid most of the rest of
the bail.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:13.348
And Jefferson Davis would be
released, April 1867,

00:18:13.348 --> 00:18:17.730
to a cheering crowd in
Richmond, Virginia.

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:21.645
He would go on to write;
to live in the South,

00:18:21.645 --> 00:18:26.298
of course, and to write the
longest and most turgid,

00:18:26.298 --> 00:18:31.590
the most overblown personal
memoir about a failed political

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:36.427
movement in all of history;
about 1300 page memoir,

00:18:36.427 --> 00:18:41.179
basically all arguing that
secession was right and the war

00:18:41.179 --> 00:18:46.430
wasn't about slavery.
Enough on Davis for the moment.

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:49.968
But back to Washington.
When these new state

00:18:49.968 --> 00:18:53.789
governments send their
representatives to Congress,

00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:57.638
beginning of December,
that's a Congress with an

00:18:57.638 --> 00:19:01.981
obvious Republican majority,
and they absolutely called a

00:19:01.981 --> 00:19:05.615
halt to the whole process.
Here were all these people from

00:19:05.615 --> 00:19:08.074
the South coming to take
the--not loyalty oaths--but the

00:19:08.074 --> 00:19:11.432
Oath of Office into the U.S.
Congress, and they were

00:19:11.432 --> 00:19:16.493
stopped, some of them physically
at the door, and told to go

00:19:16.493 --> 00:19:19.152
home.
And the Republican Party now

00:19:19.152 --> 00:19:23.310
began to try to wrest control,
and they did wrest control of

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:26.339
Reconstruction away from Andrew
Johnson.

00:19:26.339 --> 00:19:30.974
And from that day forward you
had the beginnings of a growing

00:19:30.974 --> 00:19:35.763
Titanic constitutional political
struggle between president and

00:19:35.763 --> 00:19:39.240
Congress--they are not of the
same party,

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:44.112
to say the least--that will
result in Andrew Johnson's

00:19:44.112 --> 00:19:47.021
impeachment.
Now, to the Radicals for a

00:19:47.021 --> 00:19:47.520
moment.

00:19:53.079 --> 00:19:56.723
They established what was known
as the Joint Committee on

00:19:56.723 --> 00:19:59.167
Reconstruction.
There'd never been such a

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:02.109
committee really in American
history before that date.

00:20:02.109 --> 00:20:05.492
This was to be a committee of
members of both houses of

00:20:05.492 --> 00:20:09.000
Congress, but they made no
pretence to bipartisanship.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.766
It had 15 members,
12 of whom were Republicans and

00:20:12.766 --> 00:20:16.500
three Democrats.
They said thank you very much,

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:20.346
we don't need any more.
Now, they established this

00:20:20.346 --> 00:20:24.506
joint committee--it began to
meet in January of '66--the

00:20:24.506 --> 00:20:28.666
purpose of which was to
investigate what was going on on

00:20:28.666 --> 00:20:32.886
the ground in the South,
to investigate the necessities

00:20:32.886 --> 00:20:36.533
and needs of Reconstruction,
to investigate the further

00:20:36.533 --> 00:20:42.463
needs of the Freedmen's Bureau,
and to recommend to Congress

00:20:42.463 --> 00:20:50.380
what legislation ought be passed
to reconstruct the country.

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.500
They held massive hearings,
the largest such Congressional

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.910
Hearings in American history to
that time.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.998
They saw 144 witnesses over
about two months,

00:20:59.998 --> 00:21:02.879
including Robert E.
Lee himself,

00:21:02.879 --> 00:21:06.690
who came up from Richmond to
testify;

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:10.529
testifying essentially under
orders, and he still was under

00:21:10.529 --> 00:21:13.640
House Arrest,
he didn't really have a choice.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.891
They asked hundreds of
questions, but you could boil

00:21:16.891 --> 00:21:20.742
them down to these.
They asked about the treatment

00:21:20.742 --> 00:21:25.154
of freedmen in the South.
And their witnesses were all

00:21:25.154 --> 00:21:27.627
kinds of people,
Union officers,

00:21:27.627 --> 00:21:31.457
Freedmen's Bureau agents,
some white Southerners,

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:34.410
for sure, some famous,
most not.

00:21:34.410 --> 00:21:37.532
They asked lots of questions
about the levels of loyalty and

00:21:37.532 --> 00:21:39.844
disloyalty.
What were the political

00:21:39.844 --> 00:21:44.305
attitudes of Southerners?
They were really trying to find

00:21:44.305 --> 00:21:48.539
out "what would white
Southerners actually do if we

00:21:48.539 --> 00:21:51.785
did that?"
Now, this was absolutely

00:21:51.785 --> 00:21:57.150
crucial because we've long--I
wouldn't say assumed--but we've

00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:01.276
long wondered,
and there's a lot of evidence

00:22:01.276 --> 00:22:06.579
for this, that had the white
South in its prostrate state,

00:22:06.579 --> 00:22:12.366
in its state of destruction and
defeat, had they truly been put

00:22:12.366 --> 00:22:17.159
under an honest-to-God,
legitimate, near total

00:22:17.159 --> 00:22:23.420
occupation, the assumption is,
among a lot of scholars,

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:28.275
that they (being the white
South), would've accepted it,

00:22:28.275 --> 00:22:31.630
because they didn't have any
choice;

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.940
they had virtually no choice at
all.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:36.569
And some of their leadership
was already in exile.

00:22:36.569 --> 00:22:40.083
I think I mentioned the other
day about 8 to 10,000

00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:43.316
ex-Confederate leaders,
mostly military people,

00:22:43.316 --> 00:22:46.619
had left the country,
at least temporarily.

00:22:46.619 --> 00:22:49.500
Anyway, they're trying to test
what Southern attitudes are.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.284
Thirdly, they ask lots of
questions about the needs of the

00:22:52.284 --> 00:22:54.580
Freedmen's Bureau,
what ought this Bureau do?

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.660
What about schools?
What about food?

00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.055
What about hospitals, et cetera?
And then they would ask about

00:23:01.055 --> 00:23:03.840
the need for troops and the need
for enforcement.

00:23:07.369 --> 00:23:12.042
Now, you may know from reading
Foner by now that the reduction

00:23:12.042 --> 00:23:14.799
in the Union Armies was
overnight,

00:23:14.799 --> 00:23:24.667
from nearly a million men in
arms to a mere 15 to 20,000,

00:23:24.667 --> 00:23:28.776
by 1866;
and a fair portion of those are

00:23:28.776 --> 00:23:31.349
being sent west to fight
Indians.

00:23:31.349 --> 00:23:35.284
And one of the great deep myths
about the melodrama of

00:23:35.284 --> 00:23:38.476
Reconstruction,
or the Lost Cause version of

00:23:38.476 --> 00:23:43.517
Reconstruction over the years,
is that the South was put under

00:23:43.517 --> 00:23:47.983
this military occupation,
"bayonet rule," as it so often

00:23:47.983 --> 00:23:51.032
was called.
About the only time a Union

00:23:51.032 --> 00:23:54.502
soldier fixed a bayonet,
in all the Reconstruction

00:23:54.502 --> 00:23:56.466
years,
was when they put their

00:23:56.466 --> 00:23:59.753
bayonets on, in part to defend
themselves and go after the

00:23:59.753 --> 00:24:02.926
people who were murdering and
massacring black people in

00:24:02.926 --> 00:24:06.536
Memphis and New Orleans in 1866.
The vast majority of Union

00:24:06.536 --> 00:24:08.921
troops throughout the
Reconstruction years,

00:24:08.921 --> 00:24:12.533
in the South,
were simply in garrisoned

00:24:12.533 --> 00:24:17.940
forts, on the coastlines,
occasionally in cities.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.649
The conclusions of this report,
the Joint Committee's Report,

00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:25.730
which was by the way chaired by
William Pitt Fessenden of Maine,

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:29.120
a moderate Republican senator,
but a key figure.

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.482
He had a lot of prestige.
He'd been in the U.S.

00:24:31.482 --> 00:24:34.604
Senate forever.
He was an old-time Republican

00:24:34.604 --> 00:24:38.211
but a moderate,
who had come to see the verdict

00:24:38.211 --> 00:24:43.168
of the Civil War,
the destruction of slavery and

00:24:43.168 --> 00:24:47.992
the challenge to make it good.
Their conclusions were

00:24:47.992 --> 00:24:50.637
essentially this,
and they actually used this

00:24:50.637 --> 00:24:54.665
word, that it would be,
quote, "madness" to let

00:24:54.665 --> 00:25:00.670
ex-Confederates run the new
Southern state governments;

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:06.140
madness was the word used by
the Committee's report.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.295
Secondly, the Johnson style of
leniency toward

00:25:09.295 --> 00:25:13.502
Reconstruction--and they had
various ways of putting this and

00:25:13.502 --> 00:25:17.500
various conclusions they drew
from this--was foolish.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:20.611
And the third and last,
but not least,

00:25:20.611 --> 00:25:25.320
they made a whole series of
recommendations for what they

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:30.534
called safeguards that would be
necessary to guarantee security

00:25:30.534 --> 00:25:37.342
in the South and the beginnings,
at least, of a new political

00:25:37.342 --> 00:25:43.151
regime in every state.
Now, it is that Republican

00:25:43.151 --> 00:25:49.710
majority Congress of the winter,
spring and summer of 1866,

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:53.424
that began to first pass the
great legislation of

00:25:53.424 --> 00:25:57.000
Reconstruction.
And if you want to see

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:03.369
Reconstruction as this rise and
fall requiem--and why not--this

00:26:03.369 --> 00:26:07.000
is the rise.
If Reconstruction was a kind of

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.439
bright, shining moment,
as Du Bois once called it in

00:26:10.439 --> 00:26:13.069
Black Reconstruction in
1935,

00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:15.866
this was its moment,
1866 and '67,

00:26:15.866 --> 00:26:20.866
when the actual system by which
the Southern states would be

00:26:20.866 --> 00:26:24.680
readmitted to the Union was put
in place.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.730
The first thing they passed was
the Civil Rights Act of 1866;

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:32.904
passed Congress in April of '66.
This was an act of Congress,

00:26:32.904 --> 00:26:36.371
not a constitutional amendment;
therefore it didn't require a

00:26:36.371 --> 00:26:39.822
two-thirds.
It was the first statutory

00:26:39.822 --> 00:26:45.809
definition in American history
of the rights of citizenship.

00:26:45.809 --> 00:26:52.041
It was potentially a profound
change in federal state

00:26:52.041 --> 00:26:55.064
relations.
This Republican Congress and

00:26:55.064 --> 00:26:57.610
its leadership,
at least, was going to do some

00:26:57.610 --> 00:27:00.100
very new things with American
federalism.

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:09.775
Now, it had a bunch of flaws.
It gave full citizenship to all

00:27:09.775 --> 00:27:14.500
Americans, regardless of race,
creed or color;

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.651
it said that,
the first time ever,

00:27:16.651 --> 00:27:19.736
in our history.
We'd never had a citizenship

00:27:19.736 --> 00:27:21.569
law.
It had never been legally

00:27:21.569 --> 00:27:23.640
determined who was a U.S.
citizen.

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:29.136
But citizenship had always
implied whiteness,

00:27:29.136 --> 00:27:33.695
and maleness.
It now had at least a

00:27:33.695 --> 00:27:36.298
definition.
The problem in it,

00:27:36.298 --> 00:27:39.266
of course its flaw,
and there would be a flaw and a

00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:42.471
compromise element in almost
everything passed in these

00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:46.678
years--nothing came out pure,
out of these terrible debates

00:27:46.678 --> 00:27:51.129
over Reconstruction--its great
flaw was that it was directed

00:27:51.129 --> 00:27:55.430
against public but not private
acts of discrimination.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.255
I might still discriminate
against you any way I wish

00:28:00.255 --> 00:28:06.019
privately, with my business,
with my private facility,

00:28:06.019 --> 00:28:10.071
with my school,
with a lot of ways,

00:28:10.071 --> 00:28:14.720
but in terms of public/civic
rights,

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:20.127
it at least put in place the
beginnings of the idea of

00:28:20.127 --> 00:28:25.375
citizenship rights.
Secondly, this Congress renewed

00:28:25.375 --> 00:28:29.339
the Freedman's Bureau.
They gave it a new life for

00:28:29.339 --> 00:28:32.299
another year.
And they did this--and the

00:28:32.299 --> 00:28:36.095
Civil Rights Act,
by the way--over the rapid and

00:28:36.095 --> 00:28:40.753
quick veto of Andrew Johnson.
What set in as early as April

00:28:40.753 --> 00:28:43.900
of 1866 was the Federal
Government by veto.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.227
Congress would pass a law,
whether it's the Civil Rights

00:28:46.227 --> 00:28:48.089
Act, the renewal of the
Freedmen's Bureau,

00:28:48.089 --> 00:28:51.574
and numerous other
things--eventually all four of

00:28:51.574 --> 00:28:55.856
the Reconstruction Acts in early
'67--and Johnson would veto

00:28:55.856 --> 00:28:57.575
them.
Andrew Johnson,

00:28:57.575 --> 00:29:01.267
in one and a half years,
will issue more presidential

00:29:01.267 --> 00:29:04.746
vetoes than all American
presidents before him put

00:29:04.746 --> 00:29:08.315
together.
Not the way the thing's

00:29:08.315 --> 00:29:13.018
supposed to work,
but it's the way this was

00:29:13.018 --> 00:29:16.488
working.
And then, for six months,

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:22.041
the Congress debated--and let's
remember, there's still about a

00:29:22.041 --> 00:29:26.430
one-third of this Congress that
are Democrats.

00:29:30.410 --> 00:29:34.140
I don't know how close I can
get you to this,

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:38.210
but I'm going to try,
at least to Section One.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:43.830
Oh dear.
I don't know, can you read that?

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:47.903
Good.
Because that's the country you

00:29:47.903 --> 00:29:51.677
live in.
Oh, I'm sounding so pretentious

00:29:51.677 --> 00:29:53.759
today.
But you know what?

00:29:53.759 --> 00:29:58.728
The United States was invented
at Philadelphia in 1787,

00:29:58.728 --> 00:30:03.789
but in many ways--and Americans
still don't get this,

00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:08.217
don't understand it,
don't know it--the country you

00:30:08.217 --> 00:30:11.759
actually live in was invented in
1866,

00:30:11.759 --> 00:30:13.202
in Washington,
D.C.

00:30:13.202 --> 00:30:16.970
It's the country of the
Fourteenth Amendment.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.710
The Fourteenth Amendment has
five parts.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.414
It's the first one,
the resounding one,

00:30:24.414 --> 00:30:28.900
the one authored by John
Bingham, a staunch,

00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:32.281
Christian abolitionist from
Ohio, went to a tiny little

00:30:32.281 --> 00:30:34.410
college called Franklin College.

00:30:38.109 --> 00:30:44.584
It is that first clause that
actually revolutionized,

00:30:44.584 --> 00:30:48.319
if you want,
the revolution.

00:30:48.319 --> 00:30:52.530
The Fourteenth Amendment was in
effect the Republican

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.769
leadership's response to
emancipation.

00:30:55.769 --> 00:30:58.237
Well of course the Thirteenth
Amendment is too,

00:30:58.237 --> 00:31:01.148
but the Thirteenth Amendment,
you'll remember,

00:31:01.148 --> 00:31:05.283
has a second clause that said
"Congress shall pass all

00:31:05.283 --> 00:31:08.539
appropriate legislation,
to enforce it."

00:31:08.539 --> 00:31:10.720
All right, now how do you
enforce the end of slavery?

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.019
What is the end of slavery
going to mean?

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:15.837
Or, as you were discussing in
sections yesterday,

00:31:15.837 --> 00:31:19.734
and as Foner's chapter
addresses, what did freedom

00:31:19.734 --> 00:31:21.880
mean?
What the amendment did is it

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.435
enshrined birthright,
and it enshrined at least two

00:31:24.435 --> 00:31:27.735
things into the Constitution.
Even though they're ill-defined

00:31:27.735 --> 00:31:30.690
at first and we're still
fighting over them right now,

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:33.339
in probably two-thirds of the
courts in the United States,

00:31:33.339 --> 00:31:34.961
as we speak.
And by the way,

00:31:34.961 --> 00:31:38.914
about two-thirds of everything
in an American Case Law Book is

00:31:38.914 --> 00:31:41.960
a Fourteenth Amendment
case--those gigantic,

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:46.542
God awful thick case law books,
if you ever open one--about

00:31:46.542 --> 00:31:50.414
two-thirds of everything in
there goes through the

00:31:50.414 --> 00:31:55.069
Fourteenth Amendment.
Anyway, it enshrined birthright

00:31:55.069 --> 00:31:58.878
citizenship, number one;
and number two,

00:31:58.878 --> 00:32:03.493
the beginnings of the idea of
equal rights,

00:32:03.493 --> 00:32:07.710
into the Constitution.
It took six months of debate.

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.340
It was passed finally in June
of 1866.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:22.059
These were the new framers;
if you want, the new founders.

00:32:22.059 --> 00:32:26.335
The first set of challenges
they faced, they've settled

00:32:26.335 --> 00:32:31.085
pretty--not easily--but they
pretty much settled in clean and

00:32:31.085 --> 00:32:34.744
clear language.
Those first three challenges

00:32:34.744 --> 00:32:38.206
were number one,
to define citizenship and who

00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:40.801
holds it.
Now, the Civil Rights Act had

00:32:40.801 --> 00:32:43.866
already begun to do that;
this is going to go a little

00:32:43.866 --> 00:32:46.614
further.
Two, they had the problem of

00:32:46.614 --> 00:32:49.420
repudiating Confederate war
debts.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:54.049
What do you do with all those
debts that a Confederate state

00:32:54.049 --> 00:32:57.344
had entailed,
toward Great Britain or Spain

00:32:57.344 --> 00:33:00.951
or France or anyone else?
The Federal Government was

00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:03.359
hereby saying in a
Constitutional Amendment that

00:33:03.359 --> 00:33:05.460
any debt the Confederacy had
entailed,

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:08.649
to any government,
any people, any bank,

00:33:08.649 --> 00:33:13.475
anybody, anywhere--that the
United States Federal Government

00:33:13.475 --> 00:33:17.868
would never pay them.
But they were also here trying

00:33:17.868 --> 00:33:21.860
to head off, of course,
the demands for compensation

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.009
for loss of slave property,
as a Confederate debt.

00:33:26.009 --> 00:33:29.999
And three, they had to face the
question now that every

00:33:29.999 --> 00:33:34.209
Reconstruction plan to face--and
Lincoln had it in his and

00:33:34.209 --> 00:33:38.568
Johnson had it and even the
Wade-Davis Bill had it--and that

00:33:38.568 --> 00:33:42.704
is which ex-Confederates are
going to get disqualified or

00:33:42.704 --> 00:33:45.750
disfranchised?
How many ex-Confederates?

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.943
What level of disfranchisement
would there be from office

00:33:49.943 --> 00:33:53.912
holding, or for that matter
citizenship rights at all,

00:33:53.912 --> 00:33:58.047
for ex-Confederates?
These three they settled,

00:33:58.047 --> 00:34:03.376
but there were three others
they did not settle so easily,

00:34:03.376 --> 00:34:07.583
and they were the extent of the
right to vote,

00:34:07.583 --> 00:34:12.003
for black men.
Would this amendment declare

00:34:12.003 --> 00:34:17.384
the right to vote for black men
everywhere, or only in the

00:34:17.384 --> 00:34:21.159
South, only in ex-Confederate
states?

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:24.884
The inconvenient and terrible
problem on this one,

00:34:24.884 --> 00:34:29.519
of course, is that the very men
writing this bill know that in

00:34:29.519 --> 00:34:34.079
their own northern states black
suffrage is not popular,

00:34:34.079 --> 00:34:38.611
to say the least,
and most northern whites still

00:34:38.611 --> 00:34:44.320
don't want black men to vote,
especially in their own states.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.202
The evidence of that was so
clear, the State of Connecticut,

00:34:48.202 --> 00:34:50.745
this state, in 1865,
after the war was over,

00:34:50.745 --> 00:34:53.508
held a special referendum and
overwhelmingly voted down the

00:34:53.508 --> 00:34:55.700
right to vote for black men in
Connecticut.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:04.043
Secondly, they had to settle
the extent of civil rights

00:35:04.043 --> 00:35:07.190
declared equal before the law.
How equal?

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:11.889
Which rights?
Where?

00:35:11.889 --> 00:35:16.713
That first section of the
Fourteenth Amendment ends with

00:35:16.713 --> 00:35:21.449
the famous language of equal
protection of the laws.

00:35:21.449 --> 00:35:26.019
No one shall be deprived--"no
state shall deprive any person

00:35:26.019 --> 00:35:29.969
of life, liberty or property
without due process,

00:35:29.969 --> 00:35:34.292
nor deny any person within its
jurisdiction the equal

00:35:34.292 --> 00:35:38.837
protection of the law."
And then lastly they faced the

00:35:38.837 --> 00:35:44.019
vexing problem now--and you may
have forgotten all about this,

00:35:44.019 --> 00:35:49.469
it's easy to forget it--of how
to reapportion representation of

00:35:49.469 --> 00:35:54.575
the so-called slave seats.
Those are the extra congressmen

00:35:54.575 --> 00:35:59.269
that Southern states had been
given from the 1790s on,

00:35:59.269 --> 00:36:02.968
through 1860,
because of the three-fifths

00:36:02.968 --> 00:36:07.780
clause in the Constitution.
The estimate is that between

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.128
1800 and 1860,
the slave states in the South,

00:36:11.128 --> 00:36:14.400
depending on when you take the
snapshot,

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.957
received from twenty to thirty
additional congressmen,

00:36:17.957 --> 00:36:20.641
in the House,
because of the three-fifths

00:36:20.641 --> 00:36:24.167
clause;
because three-fifths of black

00:36:24.167 --> 00:36:28.590
people were being counted for
representation.

00:36:28.590 --> 00:36:33.159
Now what happens is you're
going to count all black people.

00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:37.394
The estimate was that the
Southern states would get an

00:36:37.394 --> 00:36:40.510
additional eighteen more
congressmen.

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:44.023
So when these new states come
back into the Union they're

00:36:44.023 --> 00:36:47.599
going to have more congressmen,
more power, more clout.

00:36:47.599 --> 00:36:49.010
What are you going to do with
that?

00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:56.182
Now, the key players in
this--and I want to spin through

00:36:56.182 --> 00:36:59.550
this as quick as possible--the
key players in this were,

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.986
on the one hand Thaddeus
Stevens, as a kind of visionary

00:37:03.986 --> 00:37:06.875
and radical voice.
Stevens would've had this

00:37:06.875 --> 00:37:09.527
amendment go further than it
did, especially in Black

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:11.606
Suffrage.
Probably its greatest

00:37:11.606 --> 00:37:15.097
architect--two of them
really--were John Bingham of

00:37:15.097 --> 00:37:17.820
Ohio and Lyman Trumbull of
Illinois.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.434
They're unsung heroes.
I bet you don't know anything

00:37:21.434 --> 00:37:24.780
about John Bingham and probably
nothing about Lyman Trumbull.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:30.150
They're not famous.
They should be.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:35.391
Bingham wrote Section One.
Lyman Trumbull wrote the '66

00:37:35.391 --> 00:37:38.314
Civil Rights Act.
He actually wrote the

00:37:38.314 --> 00:37:41.277
Thirteenth Amendment,
and he will write other parts

00:37:41.277 --> 00:37:43.469
of the Reconstruction
legislation.

00:37:43.469 --> 00:37:47.233
John Bingham will stand up day
after day in the Congress and

00:37:47.233 --> 00:37:50.869
will argue that Emancipation had
finally forced the United

00:37:50.869 --> 00:37:54.570
States--this is the way he
always put it--to apply the Bill

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:57.145
of Rights to everybody.
And he argued,

00:37:57.145 --> 00:37:59.166
in his words,
that what they were really

00:37:59.166 --> 00:38:01.810
doing now, were federalizing the
Bill of Rights.

00:38:01.810 --> 00:38:05.269
Now think about it.
American history had always had

00:38:05.269 --> 00:38:06.955
the Bill of Rights.
Just tick them off,

00:38:06.955 --> 00:38:08.929
the first ten Amendments to the
Constitution;

00:38:08.929 --> 00:38:12.612
your right to religion and your
right to free speech and your

00:38:12.612 --> 00:38:15.190
right to assembly,
and on and on and on.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:19.019
But it had never been applied
to all Americans.

00:38:19.019 --> 00:38:21.531
There'd never even been an
assumption it applied to all

00:38:21.531 --> 00:38:22.090
Americans.

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:36.349
Well, there were others.
Charles Sumner, to some extent;

00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:41.151
Robert Dale Owen of Indiana,
the old utopian community

00:38:41.151 --> 00:38:45.500
leader, was quite a visionary of
this as well;

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:48.856
and some others.
But it's really a handful of

00:38:48.856 --> 00:38:52.417
six or seven people,
who wrote the Fourteenth

00:38:52.417 --> 00:38:55.467
Amendment.
Now, they faced tremendous

00:38:55.467 --> 00:38:57.781
opposition.
Day in and day out Democrats

00:38:57.781 --> 00:39:00.762
would get up and say that all
the Fourteenth Amendment really

00:39:00.762 --> 00:39:03.843
was trying to do is to get white
and black people to marry each

00:39:03.843 --> 00:39:06.538
other.
They trotted out the worst of

00:39:06.538 --> 00:39:10.834
white supremacy and the worst of
racism to try to trash the

00:39:10.834 --> 00:39:13.650
vision of the Fourteenth
Amendment.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:17.106
It's going to have effect
eventually in a larger American

00:39:17.106 --> 00:39:20.137
politics, rest assured,
because the '68 presidential

00:39:20.137 --> 00:39:22.474
election is going to be a
referendum on this,

00:39:22.474 --> 00:39:24.556
and it will be,
without question,

00:39:24.556 --> 00:39:28.004
the most white supremacist,
racist election in all of

00:39:28.004 --> 00:39:32.491
American history;
so unsubtle and so blunt that

00:39:32.491 --> 00:39:36.090
it will surprise you,
I suspect.

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:40.507
The central compromise in the
Fourteenth Amendment--I'll let

00:39:40.507 --> 00:39:44.325
you read the rest of its
provisions--but the central

00:39:44.325 --> 00:39:47.769
compromise was actually on black
suffrage.

00:39:47.769 --> 00:39:50.967
As I said, there was this
uncomfortable fact that most

00:39:50.967 --> 00:39:53.984
white Northerners didn't want
black people to vote,

00:39:53.984 --> 00:39:58.449
in the North.
So they left any enforcement of

00:39:58.449 --> 00:40:02.110
the right to vote to the states.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.847
They're going to codify the
right to vote for black

00:40:08.847 --> 00:40:12.428
males--and by the way it's the
first time the word male got

00:40:12.428 --> 00:40:14.466
into the U.S.
Constitution--a very

00:40:14.466 --> 00:40:17.553
complicated, important
amendment, and it's going to

00:40:17.553 --> 00:40:21.011
cause a terrible explosion and
actually a bad train wreck

00:40:21.011 --> 00:40:24.593
between the Women's Suffrage
Movement and the old abolition

00:40:24.593 --> 00:40:27.180
movement,
black and white men,

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:30.728
and it's going to cause
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:32.856
B.
Anthony and others to basically

00:40:32.856 --> 00:40:36.469
bolt from the black suffrage
movement, and even the whole

00:40:36.469 --> 00:40:40.347
Civil Rights movement,
such as it was during

00:40:40.347 --> 00:40:44.648
Reconstruction,
and go off and fight their own

00:40:44.648 --> 00:40:48.541
crusade.
That's another long story we'll

00:40:48.541 --> 00:40:51.734
return to.
So instead of an outright

00:40:51.734 --> 00:40:56.451
guarantee of the right to vote,
everywhere, for blacks,

00:40:56.451 --> 00:41:01.081
men, the final version left
control of suffrage to the

00:41:01.081 --> 00:41:03.504
states.
It did though,

00:41:03.504 --> 00:41:07.136
in one provision,
penalize if a state,

00:41:07.136 --> 00:41:12.105
to come back into the Union,
denied the right to vote to

00:41:12.105 --> 00:41:15.956
black men, it would have its
representation in Congress

00:41:15.956 --> 00:41:20.449
reduced to the proportion of the
black males in their state.

00:41:20.449 --> 00:41:22.436
Now that's not going to scare
many northern states because

00:41:22.436 --> 00:41:23.900
they don't have large black
populations.

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:32.342
And actually they're not going
to be part of that provision

00:41:32.342 --> 00:41:34.590
because they never seceded from
the Union.

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:38.043
But the key thing here is that
the equality genie,

00:41:38.043 --> 00:41:40.579
this language of equal
protection,

00:41:40.579 --> 00:41:44.694
this definition of citizenship
rights, it had never happened

00:41:44.694 --> 00:41:48.530
before, the equality genie was
now out of the bottle,

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:51.790
and for better or worse it
could never be put back.

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:01.217
The Equal Protection Clause is
the most malleable provision in

00:42:01.217 --> 00:42:05.094
the Constitution.
It has been used to support or

00:42:05.094 --> 00:42:09.309
advance the rights of everyone,
and everything,

00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:12.245
every kind of organization you
can imagine, cities,

00:42:12.245 --> 00:42:14.300
states, corporations,
immigrants,

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.701
women, gays and lesbians,
anti-gay and lesbian movements,

00:42:17.701 --> 00:42:21.920
students, labor unions,
anti-labor union movements.

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:25.519
It has advanced tolerance and
intolerance.

00:42:25.519 --> 00:42:29.038
It has advanced affirmative
action and the anti-affirmative

00:42:29.038 --> 00:42:31.424
action crusade.
The Fourteenth Amendment is so

00:42:31.424 --> 00:42:33.050
malleable it can be used by
anyone.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:40.961
It's the great legal wellspring
of the modern Civil Rights

00:42:40.961 --> 00:42:44.076
Revolution.
No Fourteenth Amendment,

00:42:44.076 --> 00:42:49.676
no Civil Rights Movement.
And last but not least,

00:42:49.676 --> 00:42:57.393
it is the basis of that
dreadful Supreme Court decision

00:42:57.393 --> 00:43:02.110
in 2000 known as Bush v.
Gore.

00:43:02.110 --> 00:43:06.375
I didn't make that up.
Now, in this circumstance,

00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:10.466
of the passage of the Civil
Rights Act, the passage of the

00:43:10.466 --> 00:43:13.878
new Freedmen's Bureau,
the passage of the Fourteenth

00:43:13.878 --> 00:43:17.340
Amendment, now to be sent out to
the states for ratification,

00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:20.789
comes the fall elections of
1866.

00:43:20.789 --> 00:43:25.369
And Andrew Johnson took his
case out on the road.

00:43:25.369 --> 00:43:28.070
He called it the Swing Around
the Circle.

00:43:28.070 --> 00:43:36.090
The circle was to be the Union
or--oh, where's my map?

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:37.770
I have a better map here
somewhere.

00:43:44.610 --> 00:43:51.067
Oops, no I don't even really
have the whole North on here,

00:43:51.067 --> 00:43:57.739
sorry about that.
Oh well.

00:43:57.739 --> 00:44:00.551
In the fall elections of
1866--these were Congressional

00:44:00.551 --> 00:44:02.789
elections but they're terribly
important,

00:44:02.789 --> 00:44:06.798
given what's going on in
Congress--the '66 Congressional

00:44:06.798 --> 00:44:11.244
elections were a referendum on
Reconstruction and they came in

00:44:11.244 --> 00:44:16.199
the wake of two terrible racial
riots or massacres in the South,

00:44:16.199 --> 00:44:20.119
which really got Northern
attention.

00:44:20.119 --> 00:44:24.280
The first was in New Orleans,
the other in Memphis.

00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:28.159
In both cases they were
essentially police riots.

00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:33.412
In Memphis, about forty blacks
were killed and over 200

00:44:33.412 --> 00:44:37.400
wounded, whole neighborhoods
destroyed;

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:40.170
Congressional investigations
launched.

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:45.711
In New Orleans the riots or
massacre that was conducted by

00:44:45.711 --> 00:44:51.740
the white police of New Orleans
against its black community was

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:57.962
stimulated by a political parade
of black Republicans in the late

00:44:57.962 --> 00:45:02.380
spring, 1866.
Before the New Orleans riot was

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.857
over thirty-four blacks were
killed, about 250 wounded,

00:45:06.857 --> 00:45:09.760
and hundreds of homes
destroyed.

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:15.668
This was the state of chaos and
reaction, already going on in

00:45:15.668 --> 00:45:19.460
the South.
And you don't even really have

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:22.940
legitimate functioning
governments yet.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.309
So out on the hustings that
fall the campaign appeals were

00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:31.986
on the one hand by Democrats to
prejudice and racism and leave

00:45:31.986 --> 00:45:34.769
the South alone.
Democrats are out on the

00:45:34.769 --> 00:45:37.891
hustings blaming Republicans for
causing that violence in the

00:45:37.891 --> 00:45:40.650
South--if you give black people
the right to vote,

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:43.343
if you let black people move
too high, too far,

00:45:43.343 --> 00:45:45.920
too fast, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:49.061
And the Republicans attacking
Andrew Johnson,

00:45:49.061 --> 00:45:52.130
for everything,
including his drunkenness at

00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:56.229
his inauguration,
but most importantly for his

00:45:56.229 --> 00:46:01.800
insolence and obstinance and
obstruction to Reconstruction.

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.349
So Johnson took his case to the
people.

00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:07.757
He went on a long tour--he
called it the Swing Around the

00:46:07.757 --> 00:46:10.130
Circle--all over the Northern
states,

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.548
up through New England,
all across the Midwest,

00:46:13.548 --> 00:46:17.189
and he tried to be the old
stump speaker from East

00:46:17.189 --> 00:46:22.800
Tennessee,
and it totally backfired on him.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:26.809
He demanded that Ulysses Grant
go with him;

00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:28.986
he demanded that William H.
Seward go with him,

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:31.351
the Secretary of State,
and they reluctantly joined

00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:33.168
him.
They were, after all,

00:46:33.168 --> 00:46:35.900
serving him as president.
Grant hated this.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:40.181
Grant didn't even like politics.
He's soon going to have to

00:46:40.181 --> 00:46:43.495
change his tune on that.
But what happened,

00:46:43.495 --> 00:46:48.033
in essence, is that Andrew
Johnson went out and caused a

00:46:48.033 --> 00:46:50.921
gigantic embarrassment,
for himself,

00:46:50.921 --> 00:46:55.462
for Grant, and for others.
He took out hundreds and

00:46:55.462 --> 00:46:59.262
hundreds of new U.S.
flags, that had thirty-six

00:46:59.262 --> 00:47:02.402
stars on them,
and not the twenty-five,

00:47:02.402 --> 00:47:06.945
without the eleven seceded
states, and he would pass out

00:47:06.945 --> 00:47:10.294
the flags.
And everywhere he went he would

00:47:10.294 --> 00:47:13.179
make the same speech,
over and over and over.

00:47:13.179 --> 00:47:17.572
He would say you always begin
by saying, "I stand on the

00:47:17.572 --> 00:47:20.084
Constitution."
And then he started talking

00:47:20.084 --> 00:47:22.690
about the traitors in Congress,
he called them traitors,

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:26.583
Stevens and Sumner and Bingham
and Fessenden,

00:47:26.583 --> 00:47:33.239
in their own states.
Now that wasn't very clever.

00:47:33.239 --> 00:47:36.675
He even engaged in all kinds of
undignified displays and certain

00:47:36.675 --> 00:47:39.739
kinds of vulgarity.
Crowds began to react to him.

00:47:39.739 --> 00:47:42.615
He'd give the same damn speech
town after town after town after

00:47:42.615 --> 00:47:44.300
town.
It'd be reprinted in the paper

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:46.568
and before he could get up and
say, "I stand on the

00:47:46.568 --> 00:47:48.822
Constitution,"
the crowd would start saying,

00:47:48.822 --> 00:47:50.560
"Yeah, yeah,
yeah, you stand on the

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:53.954
Constitution."
Crowds started shouting back at

00:47:53.954 --> 00:47:58.921
him saying, "Shut up" and "Stop"
and "We'd rather hear Grant,"

00:47:58.921 --> 00:48:01.120
and chants of that sort.

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:07.505
It became, in some instances,
by the time he got to the

00:48:07.505 --> 00:48:10.798
Midwest, into Indiana and
Illinois, impossible for him

00:48:10.798 --> 00:48:12.600
even to hold an audience.

00:48:15.809 --> 00:48:20.966
Then finally he started to
compare himself to Jesus on the

00:48:20.966 --> 00:48:25.039
cross;
never a good idea.

00:48:25.039 --> 00:48:28.659
[Laughter]
He was being crucified by the

00:48:28.659 --> 00:48:34.599
radical, traitorous wing of the
Republican Party and Congress.

00:48:34.599 --> 00:48:38.628
And then he invented a story
that he had been the one called

00:48:38.628 --> 00:48:42.383
Judas, and he worked that,
he worked the Judas metaphor,

00:48:42.383 --> 00:48:48.122
about as often as he could.
He was finally shouted off the

00:48:48.122 --> 00:48:55.610
stage in Pittsburgh and he just
took the train and went home.

00:48:55.610 --> 00:49:01.000
He also kept referring to this
magical circle of the Union;

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:08.829
magical circle of the Union,
and it became a parody.

00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:13.027
And in the fall elections,
the people of the Northern

00:49:13.027 --> 00:49:17.950
states returned an overwhelming
majority of Republicans to the

00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:22.333
Congress;
a slightly more than two-thirds

00:49:22.333 --> 00:49:26.420
veto proof majority,
to the Congress.

00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:30.914
And it will be that Congress,
once it convenes in December

00:49:30.914 --> 00:49:33.909
'66 and into the next winter of
'67,

00:49:33.909 --> 00:49:37.756
that will put in place the
first Reconstruction Act,

00:49:37.756 --> 00:49:41.904
and then three subsequent
Reconstruction Acts to enforce

00:49:41.904 --> 00:49:44.806
the first.
And that first Reconstruction

00:49:44.806 --> 00:49:48.500
Act we will come back to next
time, because it's crucial.

00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:53.720
But it set up here--and you can
see it on this map--a system by

00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.351
which the South was to now be
divided into five military

00:49:58.351 --> 00:50:01.397
districts,
two or three states in each,

00:50:01.397 --> 00:50:05.199
the ex-Confederacy divided into
five military districts,

00:50:05.199 --> 00:50:07.710
each commanded by a
major-general.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:12.293
That major-general was to have
control over elections and

00:50:12.293 --> 00:50:15.649
electoral boards,
and a sufficient body of

00:50:15.649 --> 00:50:18.415
troops,
it said, to enforce the

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:22.383
electoral process in the South.
And there was to be,

00:50:22.383 --> 00:50:25.266
according to that first
Reconstruction Act,

00:50:25.266 --> 00:50:28.012
as we'll see,
a high level of Confederate

00:50:28.012 --> 00:50:32.243
disenfranchisement.
This now will be the Republican

00:50:32.243 --> 00:50:35.409
Party taking control of
Reconstruction,

00:50:35.409 --> 00:50:39.826
of trying to plant the
Republican Party into the South

00:50:39.826 --> 00:50:45.475
now with African-American votes,
and they will succeed in

00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:49.858
creating Republican control,
legislatures,

00:50:49.858 --> 00:50:53.939
governors' offices,
in all eleven of the

00:50:53.939 --> 00:50:59.214
ex-Confederate states--at least
at first--and in some of those

00:50:59.214 --> 00:51:04.488
states we'll see some remarkable
experimental democracy put in

00:51:04.488 --> 00:51:06.534
place,
unprecedented,

00:51:06.534 --> 00:51:09.269
to that time,
in American history.

00:51:09.269 --> 00:51:13.166
Unfortunately,
of course, what will also be

00:51:13.166 --> 00:51:18.824
stimulated and put in place is a
deeply embittered reaction in

00:51:18.824 --> 00:51:23.222
the white South,
to now do whatever it took--by

00:51:23.222 --> 00:51:27.800
any means necessary--to destroy
the Republican party,

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.007
to destroy African-American
autonomy, to destroy the

00:51:32.007 --> 00:51:36.730
African-American right to vote.
And it will be organizations

00:51:36.730 --> 00:51:40.446
like the Ku Klux Klan,
which had been around at least

00:51:40.446 --> 00:51:44.519
since 1866 but are going to
explode with fury in 1868.

00:51:44.519 --> 00:51:48.682
And between 1868 and 1871,
the Klan and its many,

00:51:48.682 --> 00:51:52.498
many, many imitators will
engage in a kind of

00:51:52.498 --> 00:51:58.520
violence-as-real-politics,
in an attempt to take back

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:05.311
control of the political South.
And I'll leave you there

00:52:05.311 --> 00:52:06.977
hanging, with good will.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.789
Professor John Rogers:
It's fitting that the first

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:08.178
poem of Milton's that we study
in this class is "On the Morning

00:00:08.178 --> 00:00:11.682
of Christ's Nativity."
In a number of ways,

00:00:11.682 --> 00:00:17.200
it's both a first poem and it's
a poem about firsts.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.391
It isn't exactly,
though, the first poem that

00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:24.050
Milton wrote.
As you can see from your --

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.330
from actually any -- edition,
any modern edition,

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.376
of Milton which arranges the
poems more or less

00:00:29.376 --> 00:00:33.084
chronologically -- you can tell
that the young Milton had

00:00:33.084 --> 00:00:36.925
actually written quite a few
things before he wrote what we

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:39.640
call colloquially the Nativity
Ode,

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.873
 but most of these early
pieces are written in the Latin

00:00:44.873 --> 00:00:49.601
that Milton had perfected at
school and these earliest of

00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:54.709
Milton's Latin poems are lyrics.
They're of an incredibly

00:00:54.709 --> 00:01:00.056
impressive technical proficiency
and they are absolutely soaked

00:01:00.056 --> 00:01:04.800
with the references to the
classical writers that Milton

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.939
had been ingesting from his
earliest youth.

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.750
Milton had also written a
couple of very short poems in

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.222
English.
But there's an important and,

00:01:16.222 --> 00:01:20.846
I think, a very real sense in
which Milton wanted to make it

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:25.627
seem as if the Nativity Ode
were the first poem that he

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:28.785
had written.
There's also an important and,

00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:32.376
I think, a very real sense in
which Milton wanted to make it

00:01:32.376 --> 00:01:35.906
seem -- and obviously this is a
much more difficult feat --

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:39.557
wanted to make it seem as if the
Nativity Ode were the

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:42.540
first poem that anyone
had written.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.812
Now Milton was born in 1608 and
he wrote the Nativity Ode

00:01:45.812 --> 00:01:47.810
along with the Sixth
Elegy,

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.727
the Elegia Sexta,
that we read for today in

00:01:52.727 --> 00:01:56.903
December of 1629,
a couple of weeks presumably

00:01:56.903 --> 00:02:01.623
after he turned twenty-one.
It wasn't until 1645 at the age

00:02:01.623 --> 00:02:05.073
of thirty-six or thirty-seven
that Milton would publish his

00:02:05.073 --> 00:02:08.185
first volume of poems,
which he titled simply

00:02:08.185 --> 00:02:10.676
Poems.
And it wouldn't be another

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:13.254
twenty-two years after
that until Milton

00:02:13.254 --> 00:02:15.439
actually published Paradise
Lost.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:19.702
Now I am mentioning these
dates here because the dates on

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:22.900
which Milton wrote and published
his poems,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.675
the temporal sequence of these
publications,

00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:31.680
have a peculiar and particular
importance for the poet.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.942
As early as 1629 (that's the
date we're in now) Milton is

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:39.519
thinking of himself as a poet
who has not yet

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.237
published.
He delays for an unusually long

00:02:43.237 --> 00:02:47.629
time his poetic entrance into
print, and he's musing almost

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.172
continually on what it means to
be a poet who has delayed his

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:56.639
publication: to be a poet who's
waiting for something,

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.759
to be a poet who's always
looking to the future to the

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.246
poem that he hasn't yet written,
to the future and to the

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:06.900
readers he hasn't yet attained,
and maybe most gloriously,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.051
a poet who's looking to the
future to the fame that he has

00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.639
not yet successfully secured or
secured at all because no one at

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:19.353
this point knows John
Milton.When in 1645 Milton

00:03:19.353 --> 00:03:23.139
finally publishes that first
volume of poetry,

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.519
the first poem that he places
in this volume is the Nativity

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.860
Ode, our poem today.
And under this title,

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.580
"On the Morning of Christ's
Nativity," appears -- as you can

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.940
see from your text -- appears
the subtitle,

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.694
"composed 1629."
Milton's taking pains here,

00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:46.073
and he does this with very few
other poems, to let us know

00:03:46.073 --> 00:03:49.530
precisely when it is that he's
written it.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.061
"Composed 1629" -- whether or
not that's actually true,

00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:57.050
and there's some controversy
about that -- but nonetheless,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.035
the subtitle announces to all
who know John Milton that the

00:04:01.035 --> 00:04:05.226
poet was twenty-one years old at
the moment of its composition

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:09.486
and that he had therefore just
reached his majority.Now the

00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:13.060
subject matter that he's chosen
for this poem,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.070
for this so-called first
poem, couldn't possibly be more

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.449
appropriate.
With this first poem treating

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.290
the subject of the nativity of
Christ, Milton is able

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.620
implicitly to announce something
like his own nativity as a poet.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.409
It goes without saying that
there is something outlandish,

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:36.470
to say the least,
about this.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.725
We're struck by the arrogance
implicit in Milton's active

00:04:41.725 --> 00:04:45.090
identification here.
What could possibly be more

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.596
presumptuous than the
association of the beginning of

00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:50.542
one's own career,
one's own literary career,

00:04:50.542 --> 00:04:53.670
with the birth of the Christian
messiah?

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.168
Milton's implicit connection
between his own birth as a poet

00:04:58.168 --> 00:05:02.971
and the birth of the Son of God
is an act of hubris that I think

00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:07.088
a lot of his contemporaries
would feel more comfortable

00:05:07.088 --> 00:05:10.595
actually calling
blasphemy.John Milton will

00:05:10.595 --> 00:05:15.322
remain unique in English letters
for the degree of thought that

00:05:15.322 --> 00:05:19.439
he gave to the shape of his
literary career,

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.949
or actually to the notion of a
career at all.

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:29.305
No English poet before Milton
ever suggested that he had been

00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:33.329
chosen by God at birth to be a
poet.

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:36.829
None of England's pre-Miltonic
poets -- Chaucer,

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:41.147
Spenser, Shakespeare --had
dared to suggest -- and it would

00:05:41.147 --> 00:05:45.242
never have occurred to them to
suggest --that theirs was

00:05:45.242 --> 00:05:48.220
actually a divine
vocation.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.473
I think it takes your breath
away to think of the unspeakably

00:05:52.473 --> 00:05:56.940
high hopes that John Milton had
for his career.If you have a

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.285
chance,
you might want to take a look

00:05:59.285 --> 00:06:02.253
-- I think this is in the Cross
Campus Library -- at the

00:06:02.253 --> 00:06:05.330
facsimile version of the very
first edition of Paradise

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.611
Lost.
It's in ten books rather

00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.599
than twelve.
It's a modest thing,

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.394
the 1667 volume,
and the text looks perfectly

00:06:15.394 --> 00:06:21.716
ordinary until you realize that
in the margin alongside the

00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:28.800
lines of the poem are printed
the line numbers for the poem.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.757
just like the line numbers in
any modern edition of Milton

00:06:31.757 --> 00:06:33.885
that's been produced for the
likes of you,

00:06:33.885 --> 00:06:36.480
for the consumption of college
English majors.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.663
As far as I know -- I know of
no exception,

00:06:39.663 --> 00:06:43.680
although someone may well be
able to produce one -- no

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.001
original poem in English had
ever been published with line

00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:52.170
numbers in the margin in its
very first printing.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.602
And it may well be that no poem
has ever been since Paradise

00:06:56.602 --> 00:07:00.392
Lost published with line
numbers in its very first

00:07:00.392 --> 00:07:03.001
edition.
Any right-thinking printer or

00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:06.504
any right-thinking publisher
would scoff at the presumption

00:07:06.504 --> 00:07:08.860
of a poet who demanded such a
thing.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.204
The only precedent Milton would
have had even for the

00:07:12.204 --> 00:07:15.549
idea of line numbers
would have been the great

00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:18.951
ancient classics,
the magnificent Renaissance

00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:22.991
editions of Homer and Virgil.
They would have appeared in the

00:07:22.991 --> 00:07:26.230
seventeenth century with line
numbers because line numbers

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.901
obviously facilitate the
production of scholarly

00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:32.083
commentary and facilitate the
study of those texts in the

00:07:32.083 --> 00:07:35.231
classroom.
And I can only assume that that

00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:38.891
is precisely the point,
that Milton would -- later in

00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:42.199
1667 when Paradise Lost
is published,

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:45.656
he would make his poem
canonical just like The Iliad

00:07:45.656 --> 00:07:49.305
and just like The Odyssey
and The Aeneid

00:07:49.305 --> 00:07:52.250
before anyone had actually
read it.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.977
Milton would insert into the
printed text of his poem his own

00:07:56.977 --> 00:08:01.548
anticipation that his epic would
receive the same universal

00:08:01.548 --> 00:08:04.699
approbation as Homer's and
Virgil's.

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:09.774
It's a daring way to jump-start
one's own literary

00:08:09.774 --> 00:08:14.849
celebrity.Milton was
continually in a state of

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:18.421
anticipation.
And it's this rhetoric of

00:08:18.421 --> 00:08:21.101
anticipation,
this language of looking

00:08:21.101 --> 00:08:25.448
forward, that structures all of
Milton's own narratives about

00:08:25.448 --> 00:08:30.197
his own literary career.
And this is exquisitely visible

00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:34.400
to us in the Nativity Ode.
At a very early age,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.502
Milton brooded on his poetic
vocation as if it were an actual

00:08:38.502 --> 00:08:42.278
calling from God.
But the problem of one's being

00:08:42.278 --> 00:08:47.015
called to be a great poet is
that one may have an inkling or

00:08:47.015 --> 00:08:51.351
some sense of a promise of
future greatness but nothing

00:08:51.351 --> 00:08:54.879
really to show for it yet.
And he knew this.

00:08:54.879 --> 00:08:59.761
He had obviously been a
successful student at St.

00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:04.947
Paul's School in London and
then later in college at

00:09:04.947 --> 00:09:09.664
Cambridge University.
He had written a large handful

00:09:09.664 --> 00:09:13.070
of college exercises and
assignments in Latin,

00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.451
and he had obviously made a
favorable impression on his

00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:18.489
teachers, one of whom,
at least, he stayed in touch

00:09:18.489 --> 00:09:21.122
with for years.
Even when he was a young boy

00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:23.482
Milton's Latin seems to have
been impeccable,

00:09:23.482 --> 00:09:26.540
and he was quickly establishing
himself as one of the best

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.939
Latinists in the country.
But Milton's calling --

00:09:29.939 --> 00:09:33.638
this is what John Milton knew --
his calling was to be a famous

00:09:33.638 --> 00:09:36.628
English poet,
a famous English poet writing

00:09:36.628 --> 00:09:39.921
in English: a calling that he
holds despite the fact that he

00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:43.269
appears to have written next to
nothing in English verse.

00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:47.000
All Milton has at the beginning
of his poetic career is the

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.587
promise of greatness,
the anticipation of a luminous

00:09:50.587 --> 00:09:53.958
body of English poetry.Now
in the first original poem that

00:09:53.958 --> 00:09:56.805
Milton wrote in English,
titled "At a Vacation

00:09:56.805 --> 00:10:00.547
Exercise," Milton -- and you
will come to recognize this as

00:10:00.547 --> 00:10:04.290
so unbelievably Miltonic --
Milton doesn't write about love

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:07.968
or about death or about any of
the subjects that typically

00:10:07.968 --> 00:10:11.259
engage the youngest
practitioners of poetry.

00:10:11.259 --> 00:10:15.692
Milton's subject in his first
English poem is -- we can guess

00:10:15.692 --> 00:10:18.500
it: it's his future literary
career.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.659
You can look at page thirty-one
in the Hughes edition.

00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:26.295
So Milton begins by addressing
not a fair mistress or a

00:10:26.295 --> 00:10:30.470
blooming rose or -- he doesn't
even begin by addressing God.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.486
He addresses instead the
English language:

00:10:33.486 --> 00:10:36.429
"Hail native Language," Milton
begins,

00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:41.282
and then he proceeds to set out
in his heroic couplets of iambic

00:10:41.282 --> 00:10:46.057
pentameter a map for his future
career as a famous poet.Now

00:10:46.057 --> 00:10:50.022
when Milton publishes this poem,
he makes it clear that it was

00:10:50.022 --> 00:10:52.460
written at age nineteen.
That's important to him.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.712
Milton claims that he will one
day use the English language to

00:10:56.712 --> 00:10:59.919
express what he calls "some
graver subject,"

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:03.517
some more important subject
matter, and he proceeds to

00:11:03.517 --> 00:11:07.250
characterize what that graver
subject will look like.

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.450
I'm looking at line
thirty-three here.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.620
Such where the deep
transported mind may soar

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.570
Above the wheeling poles,
and at Heav'n's door

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:21.049
Look in, and see each blissful
Deity

00:11:21.049 --> 00:11:25.639
How he before the thunderous
throne doth lie…

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:28.591
Now the graver subject that
Milton is intending at some

00:11:28.591 --> 00:11:31.159
point to expound upon is clearly
an epic one.

00:11:31.159 --> 00:11:34.616
Like Homer and like Virgil,
Milton intends to soar above

00:11:34.616 --> 00:11:38.073
the wheeling poles of the
visible world and describe the

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:41.529
otherwise invisible comings and
goings of the gods.

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:43.509
And, of course,
this is what he would go on to

00:11:43.509 --> 00:11:46.382
do in Paradise Lost.
The nineteen-year-old

00:11:46.382 --> 00:11:50.779
Milton hasn't yet imagined that
his own epic would take for its

00:11:50.779 --> 00:11:55.030
subject a story from the Bible,
but the poetic ambition is

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.207
clearly identifiable to us as
epic in scope.We will hear

00:11:59.207 --> 00:12:03.313
again of Milton's intention to
write an epic in a versified

00:12:03.313 --> 00:12:06.570
letter that he writes to his
best friend,

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:10.496
Charles Diodati.
This is the letter to Diodati

00:12:10.496 --> 00:12:14.498
which Milton publishes as the
Sixth Elegy. That's the

00:12:14.498 --> 00:12:17.889
Latin poem that was assigned for
today's class.

00:12:17.889 --> 00:12:21.779
So take a look at page
fifty-two in the Hughes.

00:12:21.779 --> 00:12:27.045
Milton naturally wrote his
friend letters in impeccable

00:12:27.045 --> 00:12:32.220
Latin verse, and this one he
seems to have composed almost

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.580
immediately after having
written,

00:12:35.580 --> 00:12:38.212
having completed,
the Nativity Ode. The

00:12:38.212 --> 00:12:41.020
letter to Diodati gives us
another glimpse of the

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.179
anticipatory narrative that
Milton is sketching for his

00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:47.325
career.
Milton claims that epic poetry

00:12:47.325 --> 00:12:51.779
is the highest ambition for a
poet and then he goes on to

00:12:51.779 --> 00:12:56.790
explain how it is that the epic
poet should comport himself.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:03.059
I love this.
So this is Milton to his best

00:13:03.059 --> 00:13:10.673
friend:But he whose theme is
wars and heaven under Jupiter in

00:13:10.673 --> 00:13:15.295
his prime,
and pious heroes and chieftains

00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:19.938
half-divine…
let him live sparingly like the

00:13:19.938 --> 00:13:23.299
Samian teacher;
and let herbs furnish his

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:26.749
innocent diet…
and let him drink sober

00:13:26.749 --> 00:13:30.147
draughts from the pure spring.
Beyond this,

00:13:30.147 --> 00:13:34.391
his youth must be innocent of
crime and chaste,

00:13:34.391 --> 00:13:39.558
his conduct irreproachable and
his hands stainless.So

00:13:39.558 --> 00:13:45.278
Milton is explaining to Charles
Diodati that if you're going to

00:13:45.278 --> 00:13:49.467
become an epic poet,
you have to start acting like

00:13:49.467 --> 00:13:51.523
one.
You have to remain celibate

00:13:51.523 --> 00:13:55.180
and, as we will see in the
coming week, this is important

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:58.123
to Milton.
You have to remain sober,

00:13:58.123 --> 00:14:03.062
and you must eat vegetarian
("let herbs furnish his innocent

00:14:03.062 --> 00:14:05.665
diet").
And then Milton goes on to

00:14:05.665 --> 00:14:08.720
explain that this is exactly
what Homer did.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:13.011
This is how Homer prepared
himself to be the greatest and

00:14:13.011 --> 00:14:17.350
the first of all epic poets.
It's not uninteresting,

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:22.142
I think, to note that there
appears to be absolutely no

00:14:22.142 --> 00:14:27.288
evidence whatsoever available to
John Milton that Homer was

00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:31.370
either vegetarian or a lifelong
celibate.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.699
By all accounts,
Milton has just made this up in

00:14:34.699 --> 00:14:38.089
his letter to Diodati.
Clearly, this is something that

00:14:38.089 --> 00:14:40.759
he wants to believe or that he
needs to believe,

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:44.813
but there does seem to be
evidence that at least at this

00:14:44.813 --> 00:14:48.645
early point in Milton's life
he's intending to remain

00:14:48.645 --> 00:14:52.774
sexually abstinent forever.
He would remain a virgin in

00:14:52.774 --> 00:14:56.257
order to prepare for and to
maintain this incredibly

00:14:56.257 --> 00:15:00.918
important role as an epic poet.
And, as I mentioned a moment

00:15:00.918 --> 00:15:05.262
ago, we will return to this
question of what has been

00:15:05.262 --> 00:15:09.272
interestingly called the young
Milton's "chastity

00:15:09.272 --> 00:15:14.535
fetish."So Milton implies to
Diodati that he isn't yet up to

00:15:14.535 --> 00:15:18.251
the task of epic,
but as he describes the

00:15:18.251 --> 00:15:22.417
Nativity Ode that he's just
written, it's almost as if he

00:15:22.417 --> 00:15:26.509
considers it something of
a mini-epic.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:33.316
This is page 198 in the Hughes:
"I am singing the starry sky

00:15:33.316 --> 00:15:37.700
and the hosts that sang high in
air,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.689
and the gods that were suddenly
destroyed in their own

00:15:42.689 --> 00:15:48.244
shrines."Now we have the
trappings here of epic grandeur

00:15:48.244 --> 00:15:52.610
and epic subject matter.
The poem on the morning of

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:56.004
Christ's nativity serves as
Milton's preparation for

00:15:56.004 --> 00:16:00.452
something greater than itself.
It's a poem on which this very

00:16:00.452 --> 00:16:04.910
young poet is cutting his teeth.
The nativity of Christ,

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.216
as you can imagine,
was a popular subject for early

00:16:09.216 --> 00:16:14.642
seventeenth-century poets -- for
pious early seventeenth-century

00:16:14.642 --> 00:16:17.822
poets.
Nearly all of the poets that we

00:16:17.822 --> 00:16:22.143
come now to recognize as the
major religious literary figures

00:16:22.143 --> 00:16:26.083
of the period like John Donne,
whom you may have read in

00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:29.712
English 125, or Robert Herrick
or Richard Crashaw -- all of

00:16:29.712 --> 00:16:33.716
these poets had tried their hand
at the poetic celebration of the

00:16:33.716 --> 00:16:36.500
birth of Christ.
And actually it's instructive.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:42.318
You can learn a lot by
comparing Milton's poem to those

00:16:42.318 --> 00:16:46.090
of so many of his
contemporaries.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.275
His contemporaries are doing a
kind of thing with their

00:16:49.275 --> 00:16:52.460
representation of the birth of
Christ that Milton seems

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.629
carefully to have avoided.
And you can actually imagine

00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:58.529
without even having read them
what a lot of these poems are

00:16:58.529 --> 00:17:00.848
like.
Most poets who write nativity

00:17:00.848 --> 00:17:04.619
poems are interested in the
miracle of the virgin birth,

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:08.818
emphasizing the Virgin Mary and
the tender mother-son

00:17:08.818 --> 00:17:13.743
relationship between Mary and
Jesus.Milton shows unusually

00:17:13.743 --> 00:17:18.102
little interest in the
miraculousness of the conception

00:17:18.102 --> 00:17:23.269
or anything like the domestic
details of the manger scene.

00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:27.201
The focus of the Nativity
Ode isn't even really on

00:17:27.201 --> 00:17:30.852
the Incarnation -- that's the
theological doctrine of

00:17:30.852 --> 00:17:33.450
divinity's descent into
humanity,

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:38.542
how God becomes a mortal.
What Milton is primarily

00:17:38.542 --> 00:17:41.307
interested in in his Nativity
Ode is the

00:17:41.307 --> 00:17:44.712
redemption,
the promise of what Christ's

00:17:44.712 --> 00:17:49.150
Nativity will do at some
future point for mankind.

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.788
The birth of Jesus doesn't
immediately effect the

00:17:51.788 --> 00:17:54.977
redemption of fallen man but
it's the moment -- and this is

00:17:54.977 --> 00:17:58.440
why it's so important to Milton
-- it's the moment at which that

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:02.407
promise is made.
The Nativity for Milton is

00:18:02.407 --> 00:18:08.113
purely an anticipatory event.
It's less meaningful in itself

00:18:08.113 --> 00:18:12.150
than it is for what it promises
for the future,

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.162
because it's not going to be
until after the Nativity that we

00:18:15.162 --> 00:18:16.970
have the event of the
Crucifixion,

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:19.632
and after that the event of the
Resurrection,

00:18:19.632 --> 00:18:23.385
and finally the terrible moment
of the Last Judgment which will

00:18:23.385 --> 00:18:27.440
bring the narrative of Christian
history to its ultimate close.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.824
So the satisfactions of the
moment are for Milton deferred

00:18:30.824 --> 00:18:33.027
here;
and it's something like a

00:18:33.027 --> 00:18:37.459
recognizable process of deferral
and postponement that you will

00:18:37.459 --> 00:18:41.891
see beginning to form themselves
at the very center of Milton's

00:18:41.891 --> 00:18:47.009
poetic imagination.Okay.
Let's look at the poem on page

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:51.480
forty-three in the Hughes.
As soon as Milton describes

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.680
for us the events in heaven that
lead up to the Nativity,

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.991
he begins the -- this is the
prelude of the poem,

00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:01.578
it's broken up in to two
chunks: the prelude and then

00:19:01.578 --> 00:19:05.855
what Milton calls the hymn -- he
begins the third stanza of the

00:19:05.855 --> 00:19:09.650
prelude to his poem with a plea
to the Heavenly Muse for

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.561
inspiration.
This is line fifteen,

00:19:12.561 --> 00:19:16.136
page forty-three in the
Hughes. The poet is

00:19:16.136 --> 00:19:19.930
asking for help with the
composition of the poem.

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:23.450
Say Heav'nly Muse,
shall not thy sacred vein

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.390
Afford a present to the Infant
God?

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:30.190
Hast thou no verse,
no hymn, or solemn strain,

00:19:30.190 --> 00:19:34.609
To welcome Him to this,
his new abode…?

00:19:34.609 --> 00:19:37.807
We're struck,
I think -- or at least I'm

00:19:37.807 --> 00:19:42.069
struck -- by what I find to be
the oddly negative,

00:19:42.069 --> 00:19:44.985
almost scolding tone that
Milton is adopting,

00:19:44.985 --> 00:19:49.184
really quite inappropriately,
I think, in this address to the

00:19:49.184 --> 00:19:51.086
muse.
He seems less interested in

00:19:51.086 --> 00:19:53.893
actually praying for divine
assistance than he is in

00:19:53.893 --> 00:19:56.811
chiding the muse for not
having come to his aid

00:19:56.811 --> 00:20:00.390
sooner.We might be able to
understand some of the weird,

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:04.124
anxious energy behind this
stanza if we think of the phrase

00:20:04.124 --> 00:20:07.279
that Milton uses here:
the phrase "Infant God."

00:20:07.279 --> 00:20:11.235
As someone who would quickly
establish himself as the most

00:20:11.235 --> 00:20:14.288
talented Latinist probably in
all of England,

00:20:14.288 --> 00:20:17.549
Milton is naturally -- how
could he not be?

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:21.193
-- highly attuned to the
etymological prehistory of the

00:20:21.193 --> 00:20:25.819
English word infant.
Our word infancy comes

00:20:25.819 --> 00:20:28.857
from the Latin word
infans,

00:20:28.857 --> 00:20:32.539
which literally means "not
speaking."

00:20:32.539 --> 00:20:36.610
Christ, whose Nativity Milton
is honoring, is still just a

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:39.022
baby.
He isn't speaking at this

00:20:39.022 --> 00:20:43.339
moment yet.
He isn't yet producing language.

00:20:43.339 --> 00:20:46.901
And in his role here as a mute,
as an infant,

00:20:46.901 --> 00:20:50.785
Christ is serving,
I think, an important function

00:20:50.785 --> 00:20:54.840
for Milton.
He serves as something like a

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.248
complicated double for the
young, unpublished,

00:20:59.248 --> 00:21:03.460
and as of yet unproductive poet
himself.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.079
Consider that even this early
on in his career,

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:09.039
Milton is harboring epic
ambitions, as we've seen.

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:13.210
He is very much an infant in
1629.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:18.680
He isn't yet able or he hasn't
yet produced epic speech.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.005
And I think it's possible to
see that one of the purposes of

00:21:22.005 --> 00:21:24.880
this poem is precisely to
correct that situation.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.356
It's one of the purposes of
this poem to allow Milton to

00:21:28.356 --> 00:21:32.669
grow out of his infancy,
to incarnate or to put actually

00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:36.803
into words the talent that he
believes himself to

00:21:36.803 --> 00:21:42.142
possess.Now it's not until
the fourth stanza of the prelude

00:21:42.142 --> 00:21:46.965
that we can fully understand the
magnitude of the strange

00:21:46.965 --> 00:21:50.406
anxieties here.
We can't know exactly -- and

00:21:50.406 --> 00:21:53.611
this is one of the wonderfully
unsettling things about this

00:21:53.611 --> 00:21:56.870
stanza -- we can't know exactly
to whom Milton is addressing

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.902
this stanza.
It would appear that Milton has

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:03.007
stopped addressing the muse,
the Heavenly Muse,

00:22:03.007 --> 00:22:06.450
and that he has begun
addressing himself -- although

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.207
that's unclear.
But it may be the case that

00:22:09.207 --> 00:22:12.439
it's something like a situation
in which over the course of the

00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:15.399
previous stanza,
Milton has actually usurped the

00:22:15.399 --> 00:22:19.337
role of the muse and has begun
providing something like his own

00:22:19.337 --> 00:22:22.270
inspiration.
So in the fourth stanza we as

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:26.435
readers have no idea where we
are or when it is the speaker of

00:22:26.435 --> 00:22:29.440
the poem imagines himself to be
speaking,

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:34.859
and it's at this point that
something quite strange happens.

00:22:34.859 --> 00:22:38.009
Milton tells the muse -- or is
he telling himself?

00:22:38.009 --> 00:22:42.765
we don't know -- Milton tells
someone to hurry up --

00:22:42.765 --> 00:22:47.930
think of this -- to hurry up
with the inspiration of the ode,

00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:51.285
to hurry up with the
inspiration of the ode because

00:22:51.285 --> 00:22:55.311
Milton can see the Three Wise
Men bearing their gifts as they

00:22:55.311 --> 00:22:59.337
dutifully follow the Star of
Bethlehem to the manger.This

00:22:59.337 --> 00:23:02.960
may seem to be a perfectly
reasonable vision for a poet

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.920
considering himself to be an
inspired poet to have,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.680
but there's something peculiar
here.

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.789
Milton wants to beat the
Three Wise Men to the scene.

00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:18.452
Milton wants to arrive in
Bethlehem to hand Christ his

00:23:18.452 --> 00:23:22.805
poem before the wise men
are able to bring their gold and

00:23:22.805 --> 00:23:25.500
their frankincense and their
myrrh.

00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.077
Look at line twenty-two.
See how from far upon the

00:23:29.077 --> 00:23:32.332
Eastern road
The Star-led wizards haste with

00:23:32.332 --> 00:23:35.282
odors sweet:
O run, prevent them with

00:23:35.282 --> 00:23:39.021
thy humble ode,
And lay it lowly at His blessed

00:23:39.021 --> 00:23:41.944
feet.
Think of what this poem is now

00:23:41.944 --> 00:23:44.453
asking of us.
We're being asked to accept the

00:23:44.453 --> 00:23:47.368
fiction that Milton is having
this very poem laid at the

00:23:47.368 --> 00:23:49.329
blessed feet of the infant
Christ.

00:23:49.329 --> 00:23:53.282
Milton, who is writing at the
present moment of December of

00:23:53.282 --> 00:23:57.507
1629, is claiming the capacity
to arrive at a moment in history

00:23:57.507 --> 00:24:01.460
that he has already described as
a long-completed one.

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.360
Milton tells himself to run,
and naturally he would have to

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.261
run fast indeed in order to
arrive at a moment in time that

00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:12.490
had already occurred before he
even set out!

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:17.781
This weird temporal disjunction
is an important part of the

00:24:17.781 --> 00:24:22.798
poem, and it not only gives the
poem its peculiar air of

00:24:22.798 --> 00:24:26.630
something like a conceptual
time-warp,

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:30.933
but it's an important part of
Milton's profoundly anticipatory

00:24:30.933 --> 00:24:35.166
imagination.So Milton is
struggling here to catch up with

00:24:35.166 --> 00:24:39.112
the star-led wizards,
who -- as you can note -- are

00:24:39.112 --> 00:24:44.984
already themselves hasting.
And he tries to "prevent" them

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:49.365
with his humble ode.
We'll talk about humble

00:24:49.365 --> 00:24:53.089
in a minute, but I'm interested
now in the word prevent,

00:24:53.089 --> 00:24:57.028
which for me is really the
central word of this remarkable

00:24:57.028 --> 00:24:59.219
stanza.
Now, I don't know if Merritt

00:24:59.219 --> 00:25:02.749
Hughes weighs in on this or not.
Most editors of Milton tell us

00:25:02.749 --> 00:25:06.163
that the word prevent in
this line retains its original

00:25:06.163 --> 00:25:08.850
Latin meaning as you can see on
your handout.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:14.100
It means "to come before."
The Latin is praevenire;

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.960
it means "to anticipate."
Milton wants his ode to make it

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.170
to Bethlehem before the
Three Wise Men do.

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:24.463
Now, this is a form of
competitiveness with which we

00:25:24.463 --> 00:25:27.858
are all familiar.
This is the straightforward,

00:25:27.858 --> 00:25:32.349
perfectly understandable
competition to be first.Now,

00:25:32.349 --> 00:25:35.061
it's Milton's annotators who
tell us that the word

00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:37.220
prevent means "to come
before,

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.535
to anticipate," and on some
level it obviously means that

00:25:40.535 --> 00:25:44.318
and that goes without question.
But I think this definition is

00:25:44.318 --> 00:25:47.060
also limiting,
and this is a phenomenon that I

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.619
hope you will come to be
familiar with.

00:25:49.619 --> 00:25:54.342
The good scholars of Milton
reveal their typical resistance

00:25:54.342 --> 00:25:58.577
to anything even remotely
interesting or alive in the

00:25:58.577 --> 00:26:01.327
text.
Surely this word prevent

00:26:01.327 --> 00:26:04.990
also has a little bit of its
modern meaning.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.406
I think it might actually be
the more obvious meaning,

00:26:09.406 --> 00:26:12.740
which is "to hinder" or "to
preclude."

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.869
When Milton tells himself to
"prevent" the "Star-led

00:26:14.869 --> 00:26:16.905
wizards…
with thy humble ode," he's also

00:26:16.905 --> 00:26:19.512
saying that the wise men should
be prevented from making it to

00:26:19.512 --> 00:26:23.033
the manger at all,
that somehow the wise men need

00:26:23.033 --> 00:26:28.368
to be headed off at the pass and
precluded from presenting any

00:26:28.368 --> 00:26:33.441
gifts to the Infant God that may
compete with the so-called

00:26:33.441 --> 00:26:38.338
humble ode of John
Milton.Now this is a darker

00:26:38.338 --> 00:26:43.350
form of competitiveness,
a competitiveness spawned --

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.115
think of our own environment
here in the academy -- spawned

00:26:48.115 --> 00:26:52.306
by courses that grade strictly
on a curve: a type of

00:26:52.306 --> 00:26:57.317
environment where one succeeds
not merely by doing well but by

00:26:57.317 --> 00:27:02.801
doing better than other people,
and especially in addition by

00:27:02.801 --> 00:27:06.710
preventing other people
from doing well.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:10.761
It's an extraordinarily dark
way to characterize the

00:27:10.761 --> 00:27:15.607
composition and the process of
the poem.We have a strained

00:27:15.607 --> 00:27:20.453
image of the composition of the
poem at its very outset and we

00:27:20.453 --> 00:27:25.537
have an image of someone writing
as if he were participating in a

00:27:25.537 --> 00:27:29.161
race.
And we're reminded of the

00:27:29.161 --> 00:27:35.380
etymological root of our modern
English word career.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:39.528
Milton will only use the word
career once in his poetic

00:27:39.528 --> 00:27:42.723
oeuvre and it comes -- it will
come pretty soon,

00:27:42.723 --> 00:27:45.240
actually, in Sonnet Number
Seven.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.063
The word career comes
from the French

00:27:48.063 --> 00:27:51.609
carrière,
which means "a race course" and

00:27:51.609 --> 00:27:55.370
etymologically "a career."
What we think of as a career

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:59.336
isn't simply the benign product
of the gradual development of a

00:27:59.336 --> 00:28:02.233
certain potential.
That's how we generally think

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:05.246
of a career.
It's the outcome of a race --

00:28:05.246 --> 00:28:09.720
one's running faster than all of
the other guys –

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.426
and it's as if to have a career
at all one has no choice but to

00:28:14.426 --> 00:28:18.981
come in first.The desire to
be first is really central to

00:28:18.981 --> 00:28:22.549
this poem and it continues in
this stanza:

00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:26.670
Have thou the honor first
thy Lord to greet

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:29.809
And join thy voice unto the
Angel Choir,

00:28:29.809 --> 00:28:35.599
From out his secret Altar
toucht with hallow'd fire.

00:28:35.599 --> 00:28:39.221
As you may have guessed,
because you have this on your

00:28:39.221 --> 00:28:43.458
handout, Milton is alluding here
to the famous words of the Old

00:28:43.458 --> 00:28:47.099
Testament prophet Isaiah.
Isaiah in this passage is

00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:50.884
describing a crucial moment in
his career, his career as a

00:28:50.884 --> 00:28:54.802
prophet: the moment in which his
lips are cleansed and he is

00:28:54.802 --> 00:28:58.055
empowered -- divinely
empowered -- to speak

00:28:58.055 --> 00:29:02.551
prophetically.
These are the Old Testament

00:29:02.551 --> 00:29:05.447
lines:
Then flew one of the

00:29:05.447 --> 00:29:10.087
seraphims unto me [Isaiah tells
us], having a live coal in his

00:29:10.087 --> 00:29:12.365
hand
which he had taken with the

00:29:12.365 --> 00:29:13.982
tongs from off the altar:

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.014
And he laid it upon my
mouth, and said,

00:29:18.014 --> 00:29:21.730
Lo, this hath touched thy lips;
and thine iniquity is

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.750
taken away, and thy sin
purged.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:27.603
Also I heard the voice of
the Lord, saying,

00:29:27.603 --> 00:29:30.220
Whom shall I send,
and who will go for us?

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:36.900
Then said I, Here am I;
send me.

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.750
So what are we to do with this
allusion?

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:45.324
What are we to make of Milton's
use of this striking and painful

00:29:45.324 --> 00:29:49.327
image of prophetic preparation?
Milton can join his voice to

00:29:49.327 --> 00:29:52.601
the angel choir and have the
honor of being first to greet

00:29:52.601 --> 00:29:56.334
the "Infant God."
But before he can actually be

00:29:56.334 --> 00:30:00.789
made present at the actual event
of the Nativity,

00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:05.099
he has to endure something
painful and obviously momentous:

00:30:05.099 --> 00:30:09.259
"from out his secret Altar
toucht with hallow'd fire."

00:30:09.259 --> 00:30:13.452
The iniquity of his lips must
be burned off by a live angelic

00:30:13.452 --> 00:30:17.854
coal, that the sinfulness of his
lips -- we could think of it as

00:30:17.854 --> 00:30:22.693
the sinfulness of his voice,
his poetic voice -- will

00:30:22.693 --> 00:30:25.938
have to be purged.
What exactly that purgation

00:30:25.938 --> 00:30:29.541
will entail and why Milton's
voice needs to be purged at all

00:30:29.541 --> 00:30:33.326
-- I think these questions are
really the subject of the entire

00:30:33.326 --> 00:30:37.016
rest of the poem.
The hymn, what Milton calls the

00:30:37.016 --> 00:30:41.557
"humble ode," that follows this
introduction is the poem that

00:30:41.557 --> 00:30:44.509
Milton wants to present to the
Lord.

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:47.488
But the hymn at the same time
is something like the

00:30:47.488 --> 00:30:50.169
process,
the process by which Milton is

00:30:50.169 --> 00:30:53.803
attempting to purge and cleanse
his poetic voice and make it a

00:30:53.803 --> 00:30:56.960
voice that will actually be
equal to the extraordinary

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.880
ambition that he has for
it.The hymn,

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.967
the large part of the poem,
can be divided roughly into

00:31:02.967 --> 00:31:05.440
three sections.
First, in the first eight

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.440
stanzas you have Milton
describing the scene of the

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.220
Nativity and the effect that the
birth of this new infant has on

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:15.532
the natural world.
I don't have time here to

00:31:15.532 --> 00:31:20.016
discuss this section right now,
but you've already had some

00:31:20.016 --> 00:31:24.499
encounter with the incredibly
impressive level of ingenuity

00:31:24.499 --> 00:31:28.210
and grotesquery in this
remarkable passage.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:32.759
Nature, who is an effeminized,
personified being,

00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:38.351
is shamed and humiliated when
she finds herself naked in the

00:31:38.351 --> 00:31:43.275
presence of this new God,
Jesus.The second section

00:31:43.275 --> 00:31:48.015
runs from stanzas nine through
seventeen, and it characterizes

00:31:48.015 --> 00:31:52.522
the song that the heavenly choir
sings at the moment of the

00:31:52.522 --> 00:31:55.590
Nativity.
But when Milton describes the

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:59.619
song of the angelic choir he
can't -- it's amazing –

00:31:59.619 --> 00:32:03.950
he can't seem to focus on the
event at hand.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.385
What we should,
I think, be witnessing here is

00:32:07.385 --> 00:32:11.020
the nativity of Christ and all
of the events immediately

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:14.390
surrounding the actual birth of
the Infant God;

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:18.427
but no sooner has Milton
mentioned the singing of the

00:32:18.427 --> 00:32:23.009
angelic choir at the Nativity
than he reminds himself of all

00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:25.960
the other times that they've
sung.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:30.858
It's something like liner notes
or a performance history of the

00:32:30.858 --> 00:32:35.519
cosmos' greatest singing group
ever.Look at line 120.

00:32:35.519 --> 00:32:39.763
Milton writes that this choir
had been singing at the moment

00:32:39.763 --> 00:32:41.800
of creation.
Not bad.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:45.400
While the Creator Great
His constellations set,

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.319
And the well-balanc't world on
hinges hung…

00:32:50.319 --> 00:32:53.200
It's almost too much for this
poet.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.358
He's already been playing
around with the temporality of

00:32:55.358 --> 00:32:56.979
the poem.
as we've seen,

00:32:56.979 --> 00:33:01.735
establishing a fiction that
works to place himself at the

00:33:01.735 --> 00:33:06.407
scene of a nativity that
obviously occurs 1600 years and

00:33:06.407 --> 00:33:10.880
change before his own birth.
But it's almost as if Milton

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.579
were tempted now to make himself
go even further back,

00:33:14.579 --> 00:33:17.380
to write a humble ode that he
could place at the feet of the

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.180
Creator, the Creator at the
moment of the actual creation of

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.883
the entire universe.
The stakes of coming first seem

00:33:23.883 --> 00:33:27.852
are getting higher and
higher.Before long the

00:33:27.852 --> 00:33:32.316
speaker realizes that this
fantasy (and it is a fantasy

00:33:32.316 --> 00:33:36.864
that he's been engaged in) is
starting to sound a little

00:33:36.864 --> 00:33:40.420
extreme or maybe a little
dangerous.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:44.318
In line 134,
Milton indicates that this holy

00:33:44.318 --> 00:33:49.487
song has enwrapped his fancy,
that it has in some perilous

00:33:49.487 --> 00:33:54.000
way absorbed his imagination:
For if such holy Song

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.980
Enwrap our fancy long,
Time will run back,

00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:01.210
and fetch the age of gold,
And speckl'd vanity

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:06.095
Will sicken soon and die,
And leprous sin will melt from

00:34:06.095 --> 00:34:09.349
earthly mold,
And hell itself will pass away,

00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:14.429
And leave her dolorous mansions
to the peering day.

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.994
The holy song Milton has been
describing is beginning to look

00:34:17.994 --> 00:34:20.489
almost too tempting even to
contemplate.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:24.009
There's almost a danger here in
listening to it too long or

00:34:24.009 --> 00:34:27.831
describing it in too much detail
and the danger seems -- or what

00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:31.472
Milton thinks of as the peril
seems to involve the problem of

00:34:31.472 --> 00:34:34.128
time.
"For if such holy Song / enwrap

00:34:34.128 --> 00:34:37.720
our fancy long," then we'll
mistakenly convince ourselves

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:41.377
that time could actually run
backwards and that we've been

00:34:41.377 --> 00:34:45.230
returned to the Golden Age,
the very first age of human

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:48.163
history according to classical
legend.We,

00:34:48.163 --> 00:34:51.237
of course,
know as we read the prelude to

00:34:51.237 --> 00:34:55.284
this poem that this is a work
consumed with questions of

00:34:55.284 --> 00:34:59.561
temporal disjunction,
with that problem of temporal

00:34:59.561 --> 00:35:02.805
discontinuity.
Milton clearly wants us to know

00:35:02.805 --> 00:35:06.005
that this Nativity Ode
was written by a young

00:35:06.005 --> 00:35:09.388
Londoner in 1629,
but it's a poem that is at the

00:35:09.388 --> 00:35:12.864
same time deliverable to the
infant Christ by some

00:35:12.864 --> 00:35:15.976
extraordinary violation,
of course, of all of the

00:35:15.976 --> 00:35:17.920
established laws of temporal
sequence.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:22.464
And when you reread this poem
and you look at it in your

00:35:22.464 --> 00:35:26.405
discussion section,
you may want to think about the

00:35:26.405 --> 00:35:30.603
tenses -- it sounds tedious but
I am convinced that it's not

00:35:30.603 --> 00:35:34.730
tedious -- the tenses of the
verbs that Milton's using.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:38.482
Milton is switching here from
present to past to future

00:35:38.482 --> 00:35:42.304
incredibly rapidly and really
with a bewildering kind of

00:35:42.304 --> 00:35:45.639
facility And it is at some point
impossible,

00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:48.472
I think, for the reader to tell
whether the poet is discussing

00:35:48.472 --> 00:35:50.329
something that's happening
now,

00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:53.323
something that's happened a
long time ago,

00:35:53.323 --> 00:35:56.940
or something that will happen
at the end of time.

00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:00.595
The thematic problems that
Milton is attempting to tackle

00:36:00.595 --> 00:36:04.120
are written into the very
grammar and the syntax of the

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.136
poem.Now,
Milton understands the problems

00:36:07.136 --> 00:36:10.457
besetting what we could think of
as the poem's confused

00:36:10.457 --> 00:36:12.618
temporality;
he understands this a lot

00:36:12.618 --> 00:36:14.683
better than we do.
And there's a

00:36:14.683 --> 00:36:19.520
self-consciousness about the
temporal strangeness of this

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.840
poem that leads,
I think, to its crisis moment.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:29.876
Look at stanza sixteen.
This is the stanza that begins

00:36:29.876 --> 00:36:32.114
with line 150.
Milton has just been

00:36:32.114 --> 00:36:35.942
entertaining the glorious moment
of the apocalypse at the end of

00:36:35.942 --> 00:36:39.465
time -- because he's always
looking further and further and

00:36:39.465 --> 00:36:43.338
further ahead.
He's been doing that when we

00:36:43.338 --> 00:36:45.630
get this.
Line 150: 

00:36:45.630 --> 00:36:50.570
But wisest Fate says no,
This must not yet be so,

00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:54.320
The babe lies yet in smiling
Infancy,

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:58.110
That on the bitter cross
Must redeem our loss;

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:01.659
So both himself and us to
glorify…

00:37:01.659 --> 00:37:05.880
"But wisest Fate says no,
/ this must not yet be so."

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.583
It's here that we have
something like a crystallizing

00:37:08.583 --> 00:37:12.019
moment of reality-testing.
Milton, he checks himself.

00:37:12.019 --> 00:37:15.052
Reality intrudes and the poet
has no choice but to say,

00:37:15.052 --> 00:37:16.610
"No.
You've gone too far.

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:21.057
You've gone too far in your
anticipation of the future event

00:37:21.057 --> 00:37:24.844
at the end of time.
Fate will permit no apocalypse

00:37:24.844 --> 00:37:27.784
before its time,
before the necessary and

00:37:27.784 --> 00:37:32.119
painful steps that have to lead
up to the Last Judgment.

00:37:32.119 --> 00:37:34.734
Before the ecstatic fulfillment
of all of Christian history,

00:37:34.734 --> 00:37:36.949
the great Christian narrative
-- Jesus actually,

00:37:36.949 --> 00:37:41.327
of course, has to grow up and
lead his life and then sacrifice

00:37:41.327 --> 00:37:45.059
that life on the bitter
cross."In alluding to the

00:37:45.059 --> 00:37:49.871
prophet Isaiah in the prelude,
Milton suggested that the

00:37:49.871 --> 00:37:55.280
iniquity of his lips had to be
purged off -- burned off,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:01.679
with the live coal supplied by
one of the seraphim.

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:05.726
One of those sins,
I think, that needs to be

00:38:05.726 --> 00:38:11.559
purged is clearly the sin of
eagerness or over-anticipation,

00:38:11.559 --> 00:38:14.032
the drive to move ahead of
oneself and the drive to get

00:38:14.032 --> 00:38:16.504
ahead of others (as we saw
Milton trying to do with the

00:38:16.504 --> 00:38:19.037
Three Wise Men).
These are drives that the poem

00:38:19.037 --> 00:38:22.110
seems to be struggling to keep
in check, or that Milton is

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:25.130
representing the poem as
struggling to keep in check,

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:29.314
or to purge in some way.But
there's something else that

00:38:29.314 --> 00:38:32.655
needs to be purged,
and the poem recognizes that

00:38:32.655 --> 00:38:36.002
even more profoundly.
The Nativity Ode is

00:38:36.002 --> 00:38:39.900
continually presenting the
speaker with temptations,

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:43.440
with incitements to sin that
need to be purged from the

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:47.211
speaker's poetic voice.
The final section of the poem

00:38:47.211 --> 00:38:51.179
presents us with the most
powerful temptation that John

00:38:51.179 --> 00:38:54.909
Milton can confront,
and we will find that this is a

00:38:54.909 --> 00:38:58.659
problem that continues for the
rest of his writing life.

00:38:58.659 --> 00:39:02.880
He will have to do battle with
this temptation forever:

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:06.710
the temptation offered by
classical literature.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:09.587
You remember that Milton had
vowed to his friend Charles

00:39:09.587 --> 00:39:12.778
Diodati in the Sixth Elegy
that he would become an epic

00:39:12.778 --> 00:39:15.704
poet some day,
and that he was taking all of

00:39:15.704 --> 00:39:19.809
the necessary steps to transform
himself into an epic poet.

00:39:19.809 --> 00:39:24.124
But it's strictly a
Christian epic poem that Milton

00:39:24.124 --> 00:39:27.159
seems to imagine himself as
writing.

00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:31.053
Now, he hasn't yet settled on
the topic of the Fall,

00:39:31.053 --> 00:39:35.329
the fall of Adam and Eve from
their place of bliss in the

00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:37.777
Garden of Eden.
But Milton knows that the

00:39:37.777 --> 00:39:39.931
general feeling of the thing is,
of course, going to be

00:39:39.931 --> 00:39:42.413
Christian,
and he's probably taking as his

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:46.213
model at this point the Italian
poet Torquato Tasso who wrote

00:39:46.213 --> 00:39:49.656
Jerusalem Delivered,
a slightly earlier

00:39:49.656 --> 00:39:52.758
Christian epic poem,
romance-epic poem,

00:39:52.758 --> 00:39:57.237
that Milton greatly admired.
But Milton's also sensitive to

00:39:57.237 --> 00:40:01.132
the fact that the very phrase
"Christian epic" is in some way

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:05.305
a contradiction in terms.
The epic form is a classical,

00:40:05.305 --> 00:40:08.440
pagan form.
It's a poem structured around

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:12.983
the interaction between human
beings and an entire pantheon of

00:40:12.983 --> 00:40:16.526
pagan deities.
To write any kind of epic at

00:40:16.526 --> 00:40:21.241
all might very well seem to be
embracing an inappropriately

00:40:21.241 --> 00:40:25.957
sensual paganism at the expense
of the higher discipline of

00:40:25.957 --> 00:40:28.954
good,
old-fashioned monotheistic

00:40:28.954 --> 00:40:30.936
Christianity.
And the ode,

00:40:30.936 --> 00:40:34.837
too -- the form in which this
poem is written -- is a pagan

00:40:34.837 --> 00:40:38.333
form invented by the Greek poet
Pindar to express the

00:40:38.333 --> 00:40:42.166
sublimities of emotion arising
from a contemplation of the

00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:47.113
actions of the gods.Now,
in writing in these genres,

00:40:47.113 --> 00:40:51.820
Milton is, of course,
confronted with a dilemma.

00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.960
He's a humanist scholar.
He is more steeped in the

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.782
sensuous beauty of classical
literature, the classical

00:40:57.782 --> 00:41:00.869
tradition, than probably anyone
else of his generation.

00:41:00.869 --> 00:41:06.020
Since he was an unusually small
lad, he had been mainlining

00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:10.437
Greek and Roman poetry.
The language of Homer and of

00:41:10.437 --> 00:41:15.381
Virgil and of Pindar and of Ovid
had become an inextricable part

00:41:15.381 --> 00:41:20.639
of his literary imagination and
of his consciousness in general.

00:41:20.639 --> 00:41:23.960
But Milton was also beginning
to develop in this period a much

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.409
more strict, a much more
disciplined religious

00:41:26.409 --> 00:41:29.314
temperament.
He was beginning to join ranks

00:41:29.314 --> 00:41:32.231
with those early
seventeenth-century English

00:41:32.231 --> 00:41:36.164
Protestants who imposed upon
themselves rigorous and strict

00:41:36.164 --> 00:41:38.809
codes of behavior and
self-denial,

00:41:38.809 --> 00:41:42.797
and who were increasingly being
called by their enemies

00:41:42.797 --> 00:41:46.231
Puritans.
And it's possible that the very

00:41:46.231 --> 00:41:51.473
idea of a Puritan poet presented
Milton with what may have felt

00:41:51.473 --> 00:41:56.986
like an insoluble conflict.
It's possible that Milton would

00:41:56.986 --> 00:42:01.595
continue -- well,
if Milton were to continue this

00:42:01.595 --> 00:42:06.661
cultivation of a poetic career,
he would clearly have to purge

00:42:06.661 --> 00:42:10.145
(this is the Miltonic logic at
this stage) he would have to

00:42:10.145 --> 00:42:13.449
purge his poetic voice of the
sin and the taint of pagan

00:42:13.449 --> 00:42:15.978
iniquity.
If he was going to become a

00:42:15.978 --> 00:42:19.668
specifically Christian poet,
he would have to expel from his

00:42:19.668 --> 00:42:23.296
system the sensual world of
classical learning that for him

00:42:23.296 --> 00:42:26.861
was at the very core of his
being.And it's precisely a

00:42:26.861 --> 00:42:29.800
silencing of classical
literature that Milton is

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:33.825
attempting to effect here.
With the scene of the flight of

00:42:33.825 --> 00:42:37.022
the pagan gods at the nativity
of Christ Milton is also

00:42:37.022 --> 00:42:40.926
depicting a scenario that,
I think, on some level he's

00:42:40.926 --> 00:42:43.679
hoping will occur within
himself.

00:42:43.679 --> 00:42:47.257
We have the silencing not just
of any literature here but of

00:42:47.257 --> 00:42:52.189
pagan literature.
It's now the pagan deities who

00:42:52.189 --> 00:42:57.607
have turned into "infant" gods.
Milton is narrating or

00:42:57.607 --> 00:43:00.949
representing the process by
which they are silenced.

00:43:00.949 --> 00:43:05.971
They're rendered speechless or
dumb, and the poem effects this

00:43:05.971 --> 00:43:11.239
process in order to give someone
else an opportunity to speak.

00:43:11.239 --> 00:43:14.806
Milton calls upon a whole range
of violent, exciting,

00:43:14.806 --> 00:43:18.236
militaristic images,
and set-pieces to describe the

00:43:18.236 --> 00:43:21.940
triumph of Christ over the petty
gods of paganism,

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:26.850
but this routing of the gods
brings with it a certain cost.

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:33.769
Something is lost here as well.
Look at line 181.

00:43:33.769 --> 00:43:39.492
Hands down, these are,
for me, the best lines in the

00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:42.430
poem:
The lonely mountains o'er,

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:46.941
And the resounding shore,
A voice of weeping heard,

00:43:46.941 --> 00:43:50.100
and loud lament;
From haunted spring and dale

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:54.890
Edg'd with poplar pale,
The parting genius is with

00:43:54.890 --> 00:44:00.019
sighing sent;
With flow'r-inwov'n tresses torn

00:44:00.019 --> 00:44:06.230
The Nymphs in twilight shade of
tangled thickets mourn.

00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:09.874
It's here in this stanza,
filled with the resounding

00:44:09.874 --> 00:44:13.555
voices of weeping and lament,
that we realize that something

00:44:13.555 --> 00:44:16.389
more is going on than merely a
routing of the pagan gods,

00:44:16.389 --> 00:44:19.871
something more even than
Milton's pious triumph over his

00:44:19.871 --> 00:44:23.980
classical literary imagination.
Suddenly, the literary genre

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:28.525
that Milton is writing in is no
longer this triumphant classical

00:44:28.525 --> 00:44:30.982
ode.
You have an elegy here,

00:44:30.982 --> 00:44:36.329
a beautiful and plangent lament
for something or someone lost.

00:44:36.329 --> 00:44:40.510
And we have to ask ourselves,
"Could this be a paradise

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:42.983
lost?"
We hear a clear mourning for

00:44:42.983 --> 00:44:46.755
those pagan beings who are
forced to depart because of the

00:44:46.755 --> 00:44:50.636
violent onset of Christianity.
When Milton writes that "the

00:44:50.636 --> 00:44:54.212
parting Genius is with sighing
sent," he means the genius

00:44:54.212 --> 00:44:56.940
loci or the local spirit of
the place,

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:00.784
the natural spirit of a place:
those beneficent beings that

00:45:00.784 --> 00:45:04.630
pagans had believed inhabited
certain woods and streams.

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:08.969
But the parting genius is also
a part of Milton's own genius,

00:45:08.969 --> 00:45:13.030
his literary genius,
that aspect of his literary

00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:17.238
career and his literary
expertise that has been

00:45:17.238 --> 00:45:20.562
nourished and fed,
lovingly fed,

00:45:20.562 --> 00:45:25.161
by classical literature.
The conflictedness that

00:45:25.161 --> 00:45:29.315
Milton is encapsulating here is
probably most intense in the

00:45:29.315 --> 00:45:33.258
last lines of this wonderful
stanza: "With flow'r-inwov'n

00:45:33.258 --> 00:45:36.990
tresses torn / the Nymphs in
twilight shade of tangled

00:45:36.990 --> 00:45:41.177
thickets mourn."
This densely tangled thicket of

00:45:41.177 --> 00:45:45.982
clustered consonants in this
amazing couplet is a signal to

00:45:45.982 --> 00:45:48.550
us of the weight,
of the import,

00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:52.305
of this terrible event.
These are difficult lines

00:45:52.305 --> 00:45:55.062
physically to read,
and they may very well be the

00:45:55.062 --> 00:45:58.163
most painful lines in the entire
poem from an emotional

00:45:58.163 --> 00:46:02.059
perspective.
It's one thing for the evil

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:08.546
pagan deities like Moloch and
Peor to be forced in to hell by

00:46:08.546 --> 00:46:12.269
the newly born Christ.
Who are they to us?

00:46:12.269 --> 00:46:16.099
We find it difficult to bewail
their absence.

00:46:16.099 --> 00:46:19.890
But the nymphs in all of their
sensuous beauty,

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:24.998
with "flow'r-inwov'n tresses,"
they have to experience the same

00:46:24.998 --> 00:46:27.864
fate.
I think it's impossible not to

00:46:27.864 --> 00:46:31.760
wince when we imagine the
painful tearing of the nymphs'

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.556
tresses.
Their hair gets caught on the

00:46:34.556 --> 00:46:38.728
tangled thickets of the forest
as they abandon -- as they are

00:46:38.728 --> 00:46:42.899
forced to abandon -- the
classical corners of Milton's

00:46:42.899 --> 00:46:46.654
literary imagination.The
elegiac tone of this final

00:46:46.654 --> 00:46:50.756
section of the poem should give
us some clues to the type of

00:46:50.756 --> 00:46:54.372
victory over paganism that
Christ's birth is actually

00:46:54.372 --> 00:46:58.451
heralding here.
How new will this new world

00:46:58.451 --> 00:47:01.832
order actually be?
We may imagine that henceforth,

00:47:01.832 --> 00:47:04.420
now that he has written his
Nativity Ode,

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:14.018
Milton has fully expunged
from his literary system that

00:47:14.018 --> 00:47:21.300
youthful attachment to the pagan
classics.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:25.760
But the expulsion of paganism
described in the Nativity Ode is

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:29.928
a scene that Milton will return
to and return to again and

00:47:29.928 --> 00:47:32.628
again,
and in many ways it will be

00:47:32.628 --> 00:47:36.637
Christianity's triumph over
paganism and all of the pain

00:47:36.637 --> 00:47:41.084
that that triumph produces that
will become the hidden subtext

00:47:41.084 --> 00:47:44.000
of many of Milton's greatest
works.

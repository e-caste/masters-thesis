00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:03.400
J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE: So
we've talked

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.833
about the main events in NMR

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.633
spectroscopy for determining
structure. 

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:13.633
That is, about the chemical
shift and about spin-spin 

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:18.167
splitting, that allows you to
tell how many nearby 

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:20.233
nuclei there are. 

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:23.867
Today we're going to talk about
some complications that 

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:28.433
make the spectrum more
complicated, and perhaps more 

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:33.200
informative, in terms of high
order effects, higher-order 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.933
effects in spin-spin splitting.

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:39.400
And then about using NMR to
study, not structure, but to 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.267
study rates. 

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:42.700
And we'll do some C-13 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.700
labeling stuff there. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.933
So spin-spin splitting with
other nuclei besides protons 

00:00:50.933 --> 00:00:54.133
next door, and we actually saw
some of this last time with 

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.733
deuterium splitting, with C-13.

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:57.600
splitting. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.267
For example, if there's a signal
like this and you blow 

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:03.067
it way up by 30 times, then you
can see that. 

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:07.100
What gives these things that are
so far apart 126 Hz. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.267
Do you remember this from last--

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.767
what are the size of splittings
you normally see 

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:14.067
for protons that are on adjacent
carbons? 

00:01:14.067 --> 00:01:16.033
They're the order of 7 Hz,
right? 

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:17.667
Here we have got 126. 

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:21.300
What's the big thing that's
going on? 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.533
What makes coupling so big? 

00:01:25.533 --> 00:01:30.867
It's C-13-H. In fact, 99% of the
sample-- 

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:33.367
if you haven't specifically put
C-13s 

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:35.067
in there, are C-12 

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:37.200
but about 1% are C-12. 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.933
So you see that. 

00:01:37.933 --> 00:01:42.933
Now here's a paper from 1959,
which first noted something 

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:46.633
interesting about these C13-H
coupling constants, that they 

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:50.167
relate to the amount of
s-character in the carbon 

00:01:50.167 --> 00:01:52.867
atomic orbital that's involved
in the bonds. 

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:56.367
Remember, we said that the
information has to be 

00:01:56.367 --> 00:02:00.700
communicated through the
electrons because the action 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.933
of magnets through space 

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:06.300
if you average over all angles
of rotation in a liquid-- 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.900
goes to zero. 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.000
So you communicate through the
bonds. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.067
The nice thing about...

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:14.533
that it's so strong for JC13-H,
is that

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:19.033
C-13 has just one bond to get to
the H. So it's a very short 

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:21.933
path to communicate. 

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.333
Now, but you remember, also,
that to do that-- so that it 

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:27.033
doesn't average out as you
tumble-- 

00:02:27.033 --> 00:02:30.267
you have to have the electrons
in an s orbital.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:33.667
So the hydrogen uses its s
orbital, that's all it's got 

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:34.800
essentially. 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.167
But carbon can use s or p. So
the hybridization, as they say 

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:42.267
here, relates to the coupling
constant. 

00:02:42.267 --> 00:02:45.533
Because to communicate that
electron must 

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.367
be on the C-13 nucleus. 

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.600
So this is a table from that
paper. 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.367
It gives the coupling constant
in units of per second. 

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:57.633
Those were then changed to be
called Hz, nowadays. 

00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:59.700
So here are a bunch of different
compounds and 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.833
their JC13-H coupling constants.

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.667
If we make a histogram of them,
you see that there's a 

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:07.900
group between 120 to 140 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.333
one between 150 and 170 

00:03:10.333 --> 00:03:12.600
and another group down around
250. 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.233
So there are different groups
involved here. 

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:17.433
There are three different
populations, we could draw the 

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:18.867
lines between them. 

00:03:18.867 --> 00:03:22.267
And then if we look to see what
the carbons are, that 

00:03:22.267 --> 00:03:26.467
bear these hydrogens that show
that splitting, we could look 

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:28.300
first at the very big ones down
there. 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.833
And what's special about those
carbons that are 

00:03:30.833 --> 00:03:33.733
splitting the hydrogens? 

00:03:33.733 --> 00:03:35.300
They're triple bonded. 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.100
So sp hybridization 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.533
50% s in the bond to hydrogen. 

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:46.300
The ones here, the green ones,
are in aromatic systems, so 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.600
they have sp squared
hybridization. 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.167
Except for cyclopropane. 

00:03:51.167 --> 00:03:54.533
Why would it have such a high
coupling constant? 

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:57.000
Why would it have a lot of
s-character 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.100
in the bond to hydrogen 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.867
the carbon that's in the
cyclopropane? 

00:04:02.867 --> 00:04:06.600
Because its bonds normally are
tetrahedral-sp cubed 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.133
but when you try to make a
smaller angle, more 

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:15.967
p-character in the bonds to the
other carbons, therefore 

00:04:15.967 --> 00:04:18.433
more s-character coming out to
the hydrogens. 

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:21.733
So we can actually see that
hybridization change in the 

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:25.900
NMR. And then these other are
normal methyl groups, I speak 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.600
sp cubed hybridized carbons. 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.533
So here in NMR, we have direct
evidence for this 

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:35.867
hybridization stuff we talked
about last semester. 

00:04:35.867 --> 00:04:39.000
So it's sp, sp squared, sp
cubed. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.467
Now here's a subtle point. 

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:44.700
Perhaps we shouldn't be spending
time on it, but it's 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.433
so interesting. And I suspect
the curious among you may have 

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:49.900
wondered about this. 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.333
Because we talked about coupling

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.567
goes through the bonds. 

00:04:54.567 --> 00:05:00.367
So from H to C to C to H. How
about H to C to H? 

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:03.667
That's a shorter path. 

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:07.067
So methane, if you're looking at
one hydrogen, how many 

00:05:07.067 --> 00:05:11.067
other hydrogens would you think
it would be coupled to? 

00:05:11.067 --> 00:05:12.567
Three. 

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:15.733
And they could be in 1:3:3:1. 

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:19.533
So you should see a quartet for
a proton of CH4. 

00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:23.233
But you don't, you just see a
single sharp peak. 

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:25.267
So where did the splitting go? 

00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:28.100
And this is related to what we
talked about last time, where 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.033
a book said the splitting
constant is zero. 

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:34.967
And I said that's not true, the
splitting constant is 

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:36.700
high, maybe 10. 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.167
But it's not observable. 

00:05:38.167 --> 00:05:43.700
So why is it, why don't you see
quartets for CH4? 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.400
OK, so here's one of these
spectra-- actually if you go 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.900
up here and you can click on
that and get taken to the 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.200
website of Chem 220 where they
have problems. I'll work one 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.067
problem later in the class, if
we have time. 

00:05:58.067 --> 00:06:00.300
But there are others you can
practice on there. 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.167
So this is a compound, and I'll
tell you its answer. 

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:05.300
It's cinnamic acid. 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.767
It's related to the adelhyde
related to this acid, 

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:13.000
cinnamaldehyde is the smell of
cinnamon. 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.367
So what do we expect when we
look at the proton spectrum-- 

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:18.167
this is the proton spectrum of
it-- what do we expect? 

00:06:18.167 --> 00:06:22.333
Well, notice that we can draw
resonance structures, which 

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:26.167
will put positive charge on the
carbon with that hydrogen, 

00:06:26.167 --> 00:06:28.933
so remove electron density from
that hydrogen. 

00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:31.833
Or from that one, or that one,
or that one. 

00:06:31.833 --> 00:06:35.667
So those all should be shifted
downfield relative to where 

00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:38.000
they would otherwise be,
relative to the ones that 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.267
aren't blue. 

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:44.900
When we look at the compound,
then, we see these really 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.167
complicated peaks in here. We
throw up our hands trying 

00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:49.533
to understand that. 

00:06:49.533 --> 00:06:52.667
And then we see here two
doublets 

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:55.500
really nice, sharp, clean
things. 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.867
So what do you think the two
doublets are out here? 

00:06:58.867 --> 00:07:02.233
Let's ignore that bit for the
time being and talk about 

00:07:02.233 --> 00:07:04.700
these two doublets. 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.633
Which protons do you think those
come from? 

00:07:07.633 --> 00:07:10.233
Which one is this? 

00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:12.167
OK, let me start going around
the compound. 

00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:14.400
The OH is way down further. 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.700
We're not showing that. 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.600
OK, so I go down. 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.767
I come to this one. 

00:07:17.767 --> 00:07:18.733
What do you think that is? 

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:22.067
STUDENT: The one near the COOH.

00:07:22.067 --> 00:07:24.200
PROFESSOR: No, that's the one up
here. 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.133
This is where double bonds
normally come. 

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:30.933
Then you come here, and that one
has a hydrogen on double- 

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:35.033
bonded carbon, but it's down
here because it's has lost 

00:07:35.033 --> 00:07:36.467
electron density. 

00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:38.667
Remember we drew a resonance
structure where the blue 

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:40.200
ones were more positive. 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.633
And then here, we have hydrogens
that are on the 

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:46.933
benzene ring, shifted down this
way because of the ring 

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.200
shift, the aromatic ring current
that we 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.567
talked about last time. 

00:07:51.567 --> 00:07:54.733
And now there's a group of three
and a group of two. 

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:58.067
These are positive and are
shifted down. 

00:07:58.067 --> 00:07:59.500
That's the group of two. 

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.433
The group of three here is these
two, plus this one. 

00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:08.567
Which would be shifted down
because it's positive, but up 

00:08:08.567 --> 00:08:11.100
because it's far from this sp
squared carbon. 

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.267
Let's not worry about why that
is. 

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:15.200
But at any rate, that's the
benzene ones. 

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.167
But that's not what we're going
to talk about here. 

00:08:17.167 --> 00:08:18.900
What we're going to talk about
is the clean 

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.967
signals. Here and here. 

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:26.867
Now this is measured with a
magnetic field of 7.05 Tesla. 

00:08:26.867 --> 00:08:30.200
That means it's a 300 MHz
spectrometer. 

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.367
So instead of using parts per
million down here, we could 

00:08:33.367 --> 00:08:35.667
change to Hz if we wanted to,
change 

00:08:35.667 --> 00:08:37.300
to a frequency scale. 

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.400
And in terms of frequency, if we
call zero the middle, then 

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.000
that's lower-frequency to the
top, higher- 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.967
frequency to the bottom. 

00:08:45.967 --> 00:08:50.767
It turns out that the ratio of
the chemical shift difference, 

00:08:50.767 --> 00:08:54.700
delta--measured in Hz, not in
parts per million 

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.867
we want to be comparing apples
with apples 

00:08:56.867 --> 00:08:58.400
here, Hz with Hz-- 

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.467
so the chemical shift from here
to here is much bigger 

00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:09.067
than the coupling constant, J.
It's 24.4 times as large, and 

00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:10.933
that's the pattern we see. 

00:09:10.933 --> 00:09:15.333
Now suppose we used a smaller
magnetic field. 

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:16.867
What's going to happen? 

00:09:16.867 --> 00:09:18.867
The chemical shift in parts per
million 

00:09:18.867 --> 00:09:21.833
will stay the same. 

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:26.000
But it'll be the same fraction
of a smaller frequency. If we 

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.067
use a smaller field. 

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:29.067
The precession frequency gets
smaller. 

00:09:29.067 --> 00:09:31.733
So if we measure in Hz, as we're
doing here, they'll come 

00:09:31.733 --> 00:09:33.333
closer together 

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:35.533
but J will stay the same,
because it doesn't 

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:36.967
depend on the field. 

00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:39.533
The magnets are not dependent on
the 

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:42.033
field, they're coupling. 

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:43.367
So what will happen? 

00:09:43.367 --> 00:09:46.267
These two doublets will move
together. 

00:09:46.267 --> 00:09:51.033
So at 2.89, it turns out the
ratio is 10. 

00:09:51.033 --> 00:09:52.167
Or at point. 

00:09:52.167 --> 00:09:56.067
0.86 Tesla, it would be 3. 

00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:58.900
Notice, incidentally, that this
would be a much cheaper 

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.967
spectrometer because it would
have only 1/10 as big the 

00:10:02.967 --> 00:10:05.733
magnetic field as the other one.

00:10:05.733 --> 00:10:08.400
But also, those other peaks are
going to be in the middle. 

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.367
Everything's going to be getting
on top of one another, 

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:11.767
and I'm just showing you what
would happen 

00:10:11.767 --> 00:10:14.767
to this double doublet. 

00:10:14.767 --> 00:10:16.767
There it is at 0.29. 

00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:21.967
And finally, if we're 100 times
smaller at 0.2 for the ratio 

00:10:21.967 --> 00:10:25.233
of chemical shift to J,
measured in the same units, in 

00:10:25.233 --> 00:10:27.633
Hz, you get the purple pattern.

00:10:27.633 --> 00:10:31.867
Now notice that the J is always
the same, the splitting 

00:10:31.867 --> 00:10:33.100
between the two peaks 

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.267
but what do you notice between
the doublet? 

00:10:35.267 --> 00:10:39.200
What's curious about this? 

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.433
I mean, I'm sure you all see. 

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.233
Some of the peaks are
disappearing and others are 

00:10:45.233 --> 00:10:48.033
getting stronger as they come
together. 

00:10:48.033 --> 00:10:50.700
The outer peaks are getting very
weak. 

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:56.867
And in the limit where the
chemical shift was zero, the 

00:10:56.867 --> 00:10:59.167
difference-- as in methane-- 

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:02.167
then the outer peaks disappear
altogether and you 

00:11:02.167 --> 00:11:05.367
just see one peak. 

00:11:05.367 --> 00:11:08.467
Now notice that that part in the
original spectrum was a 

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:13.367
mess, because all those
hydrogens of the benzene ring 

00:11:13.367 --> 00:11:16.867
have similar chemical shifts,
and they're all coupled with 

00:11:16.867 --> 00:11:19.033
one another so it's more of this
same thing 

00:11:19.033 --> 00:11:21.633
and all on top of one another,
and very complicated. So we'll 

00:11:21.633 --> 00:11:22.700
forget that. 

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.133
Let's think about what causes
this change. 

00:11:26.133 --> 00:11:28.733
This is a so-called higher-
order effect 

00:11:28.733 --> 00:11:31.600
not the simple thing, that you
have a chemical shift, count 

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.600
the neighbors and get 1:2:1,
1:3:3:1, 1:4:6:4:1 

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.733
kind of thing. 

00:11:37.733 --> 00:11:42.567
So here we're plotting the
energy in a big applied field 

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.200
of different nuclear spin
states. 

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.133
And we're talking about just two
nuclei. 

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:49.133
So they could both be with the
field; that 

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:50.633
would be low in energy. 

00:11:50.633 --> 00:11:53.633
Or one with and the other
against, or one against and 

00:11:53.633 --> 00:11:54.767
the other with. 

00:11:54.767 --> 00:11:57.633
And then they could both be
against the applied field. 

00:11:57.633 --> 00:11:59.733
So you'd have these different
energies, right? 

00:11:59.733 --> 00:12:03.467
And that's the 100 MHz, that's
the energy that it 

00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:09.067
would take to get from here to
here by flipping the red spin, 

00:12:09.067 --> 00:12:13.667
would be 100 MHz. 

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:18.767
But all these look the same,
whether you do a red line and 

00:12:18.767 --> 00:12:20.867
flip the red arrow, or do a blue
line and 

00:12:20.867 --> 00:12:22.200
flip the blue arrow. 

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.600
They're all the 100 MHz or
whatever frequency, or 300 

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.667
MHz in that spectrum we were
looking at before. 

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:34.333
So we're going to see just a
single peak at first glance. 

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:37.800
But if we home in and magnify
things so we can see small 

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.800
differences, so enlarge this
center portion by a factor of 

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.900
10 to the fifth so we can see
the difference is just a part 

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.300
per million in the difference
between the environment of the 

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.167
blue and the environment of the
red proton. 

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:53.733
Then as we expand it, we see
that they're 

00:12:53.733 --> 00:12:55.033
not quite the same. 

00:12:55.033 --> 00:12:58.300
It's harder to flip the blue
proton than it is to flip the 

00:12:58.300 --> 00:12:59.067
red proton. 

00:12:59.067 --> 00:13:01.967
The blue proton is in a higher
field because of the chemical 

00:13:01.967 --> 00:13:03.133
shift difference. 

00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:06.600
And if we call that difference
delta/2, now you'll 

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.167
notice that that made the red
lines shorter by delta/2 

00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:16.400
and the blue lines longer by
delta/2 doing that. 

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.200
So now we're going to see a
chemical shift of delta. 

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:22.000
One is smaller by delta/2, the
other larger my delta/2, 

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.433
the difference is delta, the
chemical shift. 

00:13:25.433 --> 00:13:27.633
So that's the chemical shift. 

00:13:27.633 --> 00:13:31.800
And now suppose the spins
interact not only with the big 

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.900
blue field, but also with each
other. 

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.700
And just suppose that their
coupling through these 

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:42.200
electrons is such that they
prefer to be anti-parallel. 

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.500
You could have the opposite sign
of the coupling constant, 

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.167
they could prefer to be
parallel. 

00:13:46.167 --> 00:13:49.333
But let's suppose they prefer to
be anti-parallel. 

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:52.167
So the ones where they're
anti-parallel will go down in 

00:13:52.167 --> 00:13:57.300
energy, the ones where they're
parallel will go up in energy. 

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:00.900
So let's do that. 

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.700
And now what happened to the red
and blue peaks? 

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.633
Notice that this red transition
went to lower 

00:14:09.633 --> 00:14:13.633
energy, but this one went to
higher energy. 

00:14:13.633 --> 00:14:17.067
And this blue one went to lower
energy, but this blue 

00:14:17.067 --> 00:14:18.967
one went to higher energy. 

00:14:18.967 --> 00:14:20.500
Everybody see that? 

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.100
So what's going to happen? 

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.100
The red peak is going to split.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.633
There's going to be a lower and
a higher red peak, there's 

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.100
going to be a lower and a higher
blue peak. 

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.700
So it's going to look like that.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.467
And that's going to be J. If
these shifts are J/4, 

00:14:35.467 --> 00:14:40.567
this transition got longer by
J/2, this one got shorter 

00:14:40.567 --> 00:14:42.367
by J/2. 

00:14:42.367 --> 00:14:46.133
So the difference between them
is J now. 

00:14:46.133 --> 00:14:48.733
In terms of the energy of the
things interacting with one 

00:14:48.733 --> 00:14:53.300
another, that's where we get
chemical shift difference, and 

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.567
spin-spin coupling J. 

00:14:55.567 --> 00:14:57.900
OK, so that looks just fine, and
that's what's called the 

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.133
first-order spectrum. 

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:01.000
That's what we've been talking
about. 

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.867
But there are higher-order
effects, and I think you'll 

00:15:03.867 --> 00:15:06.500
find this cute. 

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.500
Because J does something else
besides just shifting these 

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:16.733
levels, it also mixes this state
with this state. 

00:15:19.233 --> 00:15:23.300
And it mixes them into a sum and
a difference. 

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.767
And of course we've seen things
just like this before. 

00:15:25.767 --> 00:15:28.067
That's what it looks like in the
case of magnetism. 

00:15:28.067 --> 00:15:32.400
The sum has the two pointing
opposite directions along z, 

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:38.300
but not along x. And the
difference has them pointing 

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.600
opposite directions altogether.

00:15:44.867 --> 00:15:46.333
When you do that, when you mix
this with this.

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:47.833
You get the difference, which

00:15:47.833 --> 00:15:50.667
turns out to be a little lower
in energy. And the sum, which 

00:15:50.667 --> 00:15:52.300
is a little higher in energy. 

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.367
And of course, that's just like
mixing a p-orbital on 

00:15:55.367 --> 00:15:58.633
carbon with a p-orbital in
oxygen in a C=O double bond. 

00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:02.000
You mix the two, their energies
don't match, so this 

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.067
one has more of that in it, this
one has 

00:16:04.067 --> 00:16:05.200
more of that in it. 

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.567
Oops, I wrote this wrong, it
should be red and blue 

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:10.467
I'll change that. 

00:16:10.467 --> 00:16:12.467
Everybody with me? 

00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:16.533
So I didn't tell you exactly why
it couples to 

00:16:16.533 --> 00:16:19.167
this, but it does. 

00:16:19.167 --> 00:16:20.900
So this shifts those energies. 

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:29.333
Notice that that makes the reds
a little bit smaller, 

00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:32.467
both of the reds smaller. 

00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:35.567
And both of the blues larger. 

00:16:35.567 --> 00:16:38.033
So it shifted the reds to the
right and the 

00:16:38.033 --> 00:16:39.300
blues to the left. 

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:44.000
So delta isn't exactly what you
thought it 

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.067
was going to be. 

00:16:47.067 --> 00:16:49.833
That is, the difference between
the average of those 

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:52.633
two isn't exactly the chemical
shift, because of this higher- 

00:16:52.633 --> 00:16:53.500
order effect. 

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:57.200
But there's something much more
interesting that happens. 

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.867
That one is non-magnetic,
obviously. 

00:16:59.867 --> 00:17:01.767
They cancel one another. 

00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:03.567
But how about the other one? 

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:11.733
It's not magnetic along z, but
it's just as magnetic along x 

00:17:11.733 --> 00:17:13.533
as either of those other states

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:17.133
the top one or the bottom one
is. 

00:17:17.133 --> 00:17:20.167
So it has this resultant. 

00:17:20.167 --> 00:17:23.133
So it as magnetic perpendicular
to the main 

00:17:23.133 --> 00:17:26.267
field as either the one that was
where they're both against 

00:17:26.267 --> 00:17:29.067
the field, or the one where
they're both with the field. 

00:17:29.067 --> 00:17:32.733
So this one is magnetic, and
that one's not magnetic. 

00:17:32.733 --> 00:17:36.033
That is, this one can interact
with the magnetic field of 

00:17:36.033 --> 00:17:39.567
light, but this one can't
interact with the magnetic 

00:17:39.567 --> 00:17:40.900
field of light. 

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.000
So if we look over here, we see
that this one is weakened. 

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
It's not interacting with light.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.200
This one is interacting even
more strongly with light. 

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:56.267
Now what that means is this one
is really strong. And this 

00:17:56.267 --> 00:18:00.533
one is weak now, in terms of
interaction with light. 

00:18:00.533 --> 00:18:03.533
So this influences the intensity
of the transitions. 

00:18:06.067 --> 00:18:08.833
Now what it does, is it makes
the ones that involve this 

00:18:08.833 --> 00:18:10.300
level-- that's this red one and
this 

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.233
blue one get stronger-- 

00:18:12.233 --> 00:18:13.733
and these get weaker. 

00:18:13.733 --> 00:18:15.000
Like that. 

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.833
So what's going to happen over
here? 

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:22.900
This one, which is the shortest
of all, and this one 

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:25.400
which is the longest of all,
this one and 

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.000
this one get weak. 

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.867
Pardon me, this is the longest
of all. 

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:33.200
This is the shortest of all,
this red one. 

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.500
So those get weak, but the inner
ones get strong. 

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:39.467
So it changes to look like that.

00:18:39.467 --> 00:18:45.700
And the more you mix them...
They're separated by delta or 

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:52.500
delta/2, they're mixed by J. So
the bigger J is compared 

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.933
to delta, the more they'll mix,

00:18:54.933 --> 00:18:57.900
the more they'll be exactly like
this, which is when 

00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:59.033
they're completely mixed. 

00:18:59.033 --> 00:19:01.367
And the stronger these will
become and the weaker these 

00:19:01.367 --> 00:19:02.133
will become 

00:19:02.133 --> 00:19:05.400
So as the delta gets smaller and
smaller, in terms of Hz 

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.100
as you change the magnetic
field, the outer peaks shrink 

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.600
and the inner peaks grow. 

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.467
So that's why methane has a
single peak and you can't see 

00:19:15.467 --> 00:19:16.133
it splitting. 

00:19:16.133 --> 00:19:18.333
Even though the coupling is
still there, you 

00:19:18.333 --> 00:19:19.900
just can't see it. 

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.167
So the radio frequency light
loses its handle on the 

00:19:24.167 --> 00:19:28.533
flanking peaks as delta becomes
small compared to J, 

00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:30.833
as shown here. 

00:19:30.833 --> 00:19:34.433
So by increasing delta, measured
in Hz, that is by 

00:19:34.433 --> 00:19:38.667
using an expensive, big field,
you make things look more like 

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:42.067
first-order spectra that are
easy to interpret. 

00:19:42.067 --> 00:19:46.033
1:2:1, 1:3:3:1, 1:4:6:1 and so
on. 

00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:51.567
So that's the subtle aspect. 

00:19:51.567 --> 00:19:55.167
Now we're going to talk about
how you use NMR to study 

00:19:55.167 --> 00:19:57.333
dynamics, to study rate 

00:19:57.333 --> 00:20:00.400
and what we mean by the NMR time
scale, and 

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.533
how decoupling works. 

00:20:03.533 --> 00:20:07.233
So we looked at this spectrum
last time, this is a spectrum 

00:20:07.233 --> 00:20:10.967
of ethanol measured as it says
over here by your own 

00:20:10.967 --> 00:20:15.367
TA, Phillip Lichtor. 

00:20:15.367 --> 00:20:19.567
If we look at these three peaks,
we see there the OH, 

00:20:19.567 --> 00:20:23.167
the CH2, and the CH3, and we
analyzed these last time and 

00:20:23.167 --> 00:20:26.200
saw that this is a triplet, this
is a triplet, both being 

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.900
split by this CH2 

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.267
but this one is a quartet of
doublets. 

00:20:32.267 --> 00:20:39.600
Now that was measured in DMSO
solvent for a special reason. 

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.033
Remember, that peak came from
DMSO that had a little 

00:20:42.033 --> 00:20:46.133
hydrogen in it, as well as
deuterium. 

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:49.767
If we measured it in chloroform
with a little bit 

00:20:49.767 --> 00:20:51.400
of acid in there-- 

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.967
or if Phil did, he measured this
one as well-- 

00:20:53.967 --> 00:20:57.533
notice the peaks shift a little
bit. 

00:20:57.533 --> 00:21:01.900
Especially the OH peak shifts a
lot, the others shift a 

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.567
little bit, this one not too
much. 

00:21:04.567 --> 00:21:07.900
What's much more interesting
than these shifts is what the 

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:11.000
peaks actually looked like, in
terms of their splitting. 

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.567
Now bear in mind this OH peak is
here. 

00:21:13.567 --> 00:21:16.233
It's now over here, but I'm
drawing it here. 

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:20.000
So instead of a triplet, it's
now a singlet. 

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.867
And this one, instead of being a
quartet of 

00:21:22.867 --> 00:21:25.567
doublets, is just a quartet. 

00:21:25.567 --> 00:21:26.900
No changes over here. 

00:21:30.133 --> 00:21:36.000
We've lost the splitting between
the H and the CH2. 

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.300
It's no longer split. 

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:44.100
It's not split by the CH2, and
the CH2 is not split by the H. 

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.500
So what's going on when we did
this? 

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.100
In fact, what happens if we
don't have the acid in there? 

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:54.767
If we don't have the acid in
there, this peak 

00:21:54.767 --> 00:21:56.567
moves way over here. 

00:21:56.567 --> 00:21:58.500
This one stays the same place,
we're still 

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.367
in chloroform solvent. 

00:22:00.367 --> 00:22:02.600
And this one stays the same
place, but 

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.600
the OH really changes. 

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:08.867
But what's, again, much more
interesting is what the 

00:22:08.867 --> 00:22:10.567
patterns look like. 

00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:14.167
They look like that now. 

00:22:14.167 --> 00:22:17.933
So this, instead of being either
a triplet or a singlet, 

00:22:17.933 --> 00:22:21.833
is a really broad, low peak. 

00:22:21.833 --> 00:22:25.633
This one still looks a little
bit like a quartet of 

00:22:25.633 --> 00:22:28.333
doublets, but it's much
broadened. 

00:22:28.333 --> 00:22:29.933
This one is the same as it was
before. 

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:35.800
So something really funny is
happening here. 

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.867
Now let's look at the integrals.

00:22:38.867 --> 00:22:44.500
So within experimental error,
it's 1 to 2 to 3. 

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:51.433
It's 0.96 to 2, to 3.04 in DMSO.

00:22:51.433 --> 00:22:58.533
In CDCl3, it's 1.00 to 2.00 to
3.05, again with an 

00:22:58.533 --> 00:23:01.100
experimental error 1, 2, 3. 

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.167
But the one that had a little
bit of acid in it is much more 

00:23:04.167 --> 00:23:05.600
interesting. 

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.533
It's 2 to 3, that's fine. 

00:23:08.533 --> 00:23:13.533
But this is bigger, 1.14. 

00:23:13.533 --> 00:23:18.400
So that peak-- this sharp peak
here, the one that has 

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.367
acid in it, is bigger. 

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:25.800
There are more protons there
than just one. 

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.100
How did that happen? 

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:32.800
It's an average of both the OH
that's on the 

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:35.067
alcohol and the H+. 

00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:39.800
Now let's see, how did that
happen? 

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.167
Well, H+ can go onto the
alcohol, and then the H that 

00:23:44.167 --> 00:23:48.467
was on the alcohol can come back
into the solution. 

00:23:48.467 --> 00:23:50.967
So we've exchanged those two
H's. 

00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:54.933
And if that happens rapidly,
there are H's moving all over. 

00:23:54.933 --> 00:23:58.567
Most of the time they're on
alcohol but some time-- 

00:23:58.567 --> 00:24:01.967
14%-- 

00:24:01.967 --> 00:24:05.000
there as H+ and what you're
seeing is the average 

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.867
of those, in this case. 

00:24:06.867 --> 00:24:09.300
So this is averaging. 

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:18.467
The H's are zipping around not
only between acid and alcohol, 

00:24:18.467 --> 00:24:21.567
but from one alcohol to another
alcohol, 

00:24:21.567 --> 00:24:22.833
by way of the acid. 

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.600
And what that means is,
remember, the reason we see

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.867
splitting is that there are 

00:24:27.867 --> 00:24:29.233
these spin isomers. 

00:24:29.233 --> 00:24:30.867
There are different molecules in
there. 

00:24:30.867 --> 00:24:34.200
Some molecules have the
neighboring CH2 both up, some 

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:37.633
have them both down, some have
one up and one down. 

00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:40.233
But if you're zipping from
molecule to molecule very 

00:24:40.233 --> 00:24:45.000
rapidly, you see the average.
Which is nothing. 

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.300
So when we have acid in there
and it's averaging very fast 

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:52.367
by going on and off and then
going to different molecules, 

00:24:52.367 --> 00:24:56.200
then we see a sharp peak here,
the splitting disappears. 

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.267
Here, what's going on? 

00:25:01.133 --> 00:25:05.433
Well how about the ROH chemical
shift, that thing? 

00:25:05.433 --> 00:25:09.933
It's the average of many
hydrogen bonded structures, 

00:25:09.933 --> 00:25:13.400
because the hydrogen bonds keep
getting made and broken 

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:14.267
very rapidly. 

00:25:14.267 --> 00:25:17.267
So you average among many
different hydrogen bonds, but 

00:25:17.267 --> 00:25:20.300
the H stays with the original
molecule. 

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.767
It's not going from molecule to
molecule. It's just breaking 

00:25:22.767 --> 00:25:25.033
hydrogen bonds and going back
and forth. 

00:25:25.033 --> 00:25:28.833
And how fast you do that and how
much you do it depends on 

00:25:28.833 --> 00:25:31.333
concentration, on what the
solvent is, on the 

00:25:31.333 --> 00:25:33.667
temperature, and so on. 

00:25:33.667 --> 00:25:36.067
But how about the spin-spin
splitting between 

00:25:36.067 --> 00:25:38.633
the CH2 and the OH? 

00:25:38.633 --> 00:25:42.867
That can be the average
involving H-exchange among 

00:25:42.867 --> 00:25:44.233
many molecules. 

00:25:44.233 --> 00:25:47.467
It's fast if you have H+. 

00:25:47.467 --> 00:25:50.067
It's slow in DMSO. 

00:25:50.067 --> 00:25:54.267
So in DMSO, you saw H's staying
with their molecule, 

00:25:54.267 --> 00:25:56.000
and you see they're splitting. 

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.500
In H+, they go from molecule to
molecule fast. You 

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.467
see the average. 

00:26:01.467 --> 00:26:04.667
And what happens if you have
chloroform, but you don't have 

00:26:04.667 --> 00:26:06.867
the H+? 

00:26:06.867 --> 00:26:08.567
Some kind of averaging is
beginning to 

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:10.333
happen, it looks like. 

00:26:10.333 --> 00:26:13.900
So it's clear that if you have
H+ in 

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.633
there, it can zip around. 

00:26:15.633 --> 00:26:17.200
What happens if you're just
making and 

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.700
breaking hydrogen bonds? 

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:24.867
Well, you could have three
alcohols hydrogen bonded 

00:26:24.867 --> 00:26:28.300
together in a circle. 

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.333
And they could trade which
hydrogen, so this is a 

00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:34.333
mechanism for exchanging
hydrogens from 

00:26:34.333 --> 00:26:36.000
one alcohol to another. 

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.033
And then as the trimer comes
apart and the molecules become 

00:26:40.033 --> 00:26:42.500
another trimer and do this
exchange, another, another, 

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.633
another, this is a mechanism-a
slow mechanism, 

00:26:45.633 --> 00:26:49.233
much slower than this H+ thing--

00:26:49.233 --> 00:26:53.233
which can allow slow averaging
of the Hs. 

00:26:53.233 --> 00:26:57.000
But if you have DMSO as the
solvent, this doesn't happen. 

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:58.067
Why? 

00:26:58.067 --> 00:27:03.133
Because DMSO forms very strong
hydrogen bonds with the OH, 

00:27:03.133 --> 00:27:06.633
and it doesn't form these
trimers in which the hydrogens 

00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:09.500
can shift from one molecule to
the other. 

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:15.733
If DMSO were a strong enough
base, it could pull the H off 

00:27:15.733 --> 00:27:18.833
and be like an acid catalyst, it
would be a base catalyst. 

00:27:18.833 --> 00:27:22.500
Pull it off one molecule, put it
on another one. 

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.900
But it's not that strong a base,
it's just strong enough 

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.900
to forbid forming those hydrogen
bonded trimers. 

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.133
So we can get this averaging. 

00:27:32.133 --> 00:27:35.000
But wait a second, we looked at
this one a couple lectures 

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.767
ago when we were looking at IR.

00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:39.300
And we said that even though
this was said to be an 

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.900
anhydrate, it had these water
peaks. 

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:44.400
And we said there were two kinds
of water peaks. 

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.633
There are the ones that are
hydrogen bonded here, and the 

00:27:46.633 --> 00:27:49.033
ones that are not hydrogen
bonded. 

00:27:49.033 --> 00:27:51.367
That's two different peaks. 

00:27:51.367 --> 00:27:56.367
But shouldn't those average the
same way they do in NMR 

00:27:56.367 --> 00:28:01.167
where as you go from molecule to
molecule as the molecules come

00:28:01.167 --> 00:28:02.233
apart and come together in 

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:04.800
hydrogen bonding, you quickly
average those? 

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:09.100
Why don't you get averaging in
the IR when you do get 

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.267
averaging in the NMR? 

00:28:12.267 --> 00:28:15.733
Another question is, what's
fast? 

00:28:15.733 --> 00:28:19.900
How fast does it have to be to
see a blur, or to see the 

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.533
average as a sharp average,
rather than to see the two 

00:28:23.533 --> 00:28:24.767
distinct things? 

00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:30.967
This particular sample is a
solid, so you could imagine 

00:28:30.967 --> 00:28:35.433
that these are held in place by
the surrounding molecules. 

00:28:35.433 --> 00:28:38.700
But you see the same effect in
solution, so that's not the 

00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.133
difference. 

00:28:40.133 --> 00:28:43.667
Now notice that in IR, we have
wave numbers here to tell us 

00:28:43.667 --> 00:28:47.267
how fast this is vibrating and
how fast this is vibrating. 

00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:53.467
And this one is 110 x 10 to the
10th Hz, and this OH 

00:28:53.467 --> 00:28:56.300
bond is 102 x 10 to the 10th Hz.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.300
That is, the difference between
them is 

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.300
10 to the 11th Hz 

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:04.700
whereas the difference we were
looking at in the alcohol 

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:11.433
things were 100 Hz or a few
hundred Hz, at most. So 

00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:14.067
this is a much bigger frequency
difference here in 

00:29:14.067 --> 00:29:16.233
IR than it was in NMR. What does
that 

00:29:16.233 --> 00:29:18.500
have to do with anything? 

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.333
How long does it take to measure
a frequency precisely? 

00:29:24.233 --> 00:29:28.733
How long is long for purposes of
an average? 

00:29:28.733 --> 00:29:31.467
Well suppose you have two
different swings. 

00:29:31.467 --> 00:29:34.233
I'm going to put these two guys
on swings up to the 

00:29:34.233 --> 00:29:36.367
ceiling and they'll start
swinging. 

00:29:36.367 --> 00:29:40.133
And they swing at a certain
rate, but they won't swing at 

00:29:40.133 --> 00:29:45.500
exactly the same rate if they're
a little bit 

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:49.400
different, the two swings. 

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.400
This is pretty fast swinging. 

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.033
One of them swings a 20 Hz, and
the other 

00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:56.867
swings at 21 Hz. 

00:29:56.867 --> 00:30:00.067
And I'm going to try to push
them, but I'm not going to 

00:30:00.067 --> 00:30:02.167
adjust the frequency I'm pushing
at. 

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:04.500
I'm just going to sit here and
go bum bum bum bum 

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:06.067
bum bum bum bum bum. 

00:30:06.067 --> 00:30:09.500
And I'm going to do it a 20 Hz,
bum bum bum bum bum. 

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.967
So the guy that's swinging
naturally at 20 Hz, I 

00:30:12.967 --> 00:30:16.467
always push him every time he
comes, just right. 

00:30:16.467 --> 00:30:22.067
So the light field in the IR
case, or the NMR case, matches 

00:30:22.067 --> 00:30:25.433
perfectly for 20 Hz but it
doesn't match for 

00:30:25.433 --> 00:30:27.600
21 Hz, of course. 

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.300
If I just did it for a little
while on the 21 Hz just for 

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:35.300
a little while, it would be
almost in phase and I'd be 

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.933
pushing them. 

00:30:36.933 --> 00:30:39.000
But after a little while, we'd
get out of phase,

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:39.667
and I'm pushing when

00:30:39.667 --> 00:30:42.967
he's coming and then pulling
when he's going and so on. So 

00:30:42.967 --> 00:30:46.433
it's going to get out of whack.

00:30:46.433 --> 00:30:49.267
How long does it take to get out
of whack? 

00:30:49.267 --> 00:30:52.500
How long do I have to be doing
this in order to find out that 

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.800
I'm not really doing anything
with him? 

00:30:54.800 --> 00:31:00.867
Well notice that a one-second
pulse samples the full range 

00:31:00.867 --> 00:31:03.767
of phases, from being completely
in phase to coming 

00:31:03.767 --> 00:31:06.367
back to being completely in
phase again. 

00:31:06.367 --> 00:31:10.267
So if I do it for one second, I
get nothing. 

00:31:10.267 --> 00:31:12.100
It just cancels. 

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.200
On this one, everything was
golden. 

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:19.233
But obviously, then, there's no
net interaction with the 

00:31:19.233 --> 00:31:21.833
light in that one over the
course of one second. 

00:31:21.833 --> 00:31:25.733
So a one second light pulse can
clearly distinguish 

00:31:25.733 --> 00:31:28.833
between 20 Hz and 21 Hz. 

00:31:28.833 --> 00:31:30.067
Everybody with me? 

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:40.133
That means... Suppose we have 22
Hz, a swing that I'm trying with

00:31:40.133 --> 00:31:41.167
my light to hit

00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:44.200
but I'm going at 20 Hz. 

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.667
So that goes through two
complete cycles there. 

00:31:47.667 --> 00:31:50.133
In fact, if it goes through one
complete cycle 

00:31:50.133 --> 00:31:55.533
you can tell it's not working
after only half a second. 

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.700
That is, 1 over the difference
in lambda. 

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:06.433
That's long enough to sample the
full range favorable and 

00:32:06.433 --> 00:32:07.400
unfavorable. 

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.200
So I can more quickly tell the
difference when the 

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.433
frequencies are more different.

00:32:12.433 --> 00:32:15.000
It depends on 1 over the
frequency difference, that's 

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.800
how long I have to go to know
that I'm not going to get any 

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.367
action out of it. 

00:32:21.367 --> 00:32:23.400
Now here's the interesting
thing. 

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:27.633
Suppose the frequency is
changing in time. 

00:32:27.633 --> 00:32:30.467
It's averaging, a proton is
jumping from one position to 

00:32:30.467 --> 00:32:33.433
another and changing its
frequency. 

00:32:33.433 --> 00:32:38.033
Suppose that it goes at 22 Hz
for a while, then at 20 

00:32:38.033 --> 00:32:40.033
Hz for a while-- it's in a
different environment. 

00:32:40.033 --> 00:32:44.700
Then at 22 Hz, then at 20 Hz,
then at 22 hz, then 

00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.033
at 20 Hz for a while. 

00:32:47.033 --> 00:32:51.867
It's jumping back and forth
randomly at a certain rate. 

00:32:51.867 --> 00:32:55.400
Now obviously, that's not going
to work with the 22 

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.267
Hz light. 

00:32:56.267 --> 00:33:00.567
It goes in and out of phase, so
we won't get any absorption 

00:33:00.567 --> 00:33:03.033
of 22 Hz light. 

00:33:03.033 --> 00:33:07.233
Suppose we try 20 Hz light, so
we'll move it up there. 

00:33:07.233 --> 00:33:08.967
Again, it goes in and out of
phase. 

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.300
No profit in that one. 

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:19.900
But suppose I try 21 Hz. 

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.933
Now it stays pretty much in
phase, so 

00:33:23.933 --> 00:33:26.200
it's averaging properly. 

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.367
And so what we will see is we
have a very good match at 21 Hz,

00:33:30.367 --> 00:33:34.333
the average frequency, and we'll
see a single sharp peak. 

00:33:34.333 --> 00:33:37.833
21 Hz will work, 20 Hz won't,
22 will. [correction: won't]

00:33:37.833 --> 00:33:40.033
We'll see an average peak. 

00:33:40.033 --> 00:33:41.467
What's determining? 

00:33:41.467 --> 00:33:44.467
It's how long the pulse is
compared to the 

00:33:44.467 --> 00:33:46.300
difference in frequency. 

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:52.100
If the pulse is long enough, as
long as the difference in 

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.667
frequency, then we can tell it.

00:33:54.667 --> 00:33:56.800
So when do peaks average? 

00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.233
When atoms don't stay put long
enough to tell the difference 

00:34:00.233 --> 00:34:02.300
in frequency between the two
sites that 

00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:03.933
they're changing between. 

00:34:03.933 --> 00:34:07.467
So if two peaks differ by 100
Hz, you have to count for 

00:34:07.467 --> 00:34:12.600
a hundredth of a second,
roughly, to tell them apart. 

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:18.167
But in the IR, they differed by
10 to the 11th Hz. 

00:34:18.167 --> 00:34:20.833
So the exchange of position
would have to be 10 to the 

00:34:20.833 --> 00:34:24.633
11th times a second in order to
be able to 

00:34:24.633 --> 00:34:27.867
see separate peaks. 

00:34:27.867 --> 00:34:29.933
That's as fast as atoms vibrate.

00:34:29.933 --> 00:34:33.467
They can't change their partners
that rapidly. 

00:34:33.467 --> 00:34:38.100
So that's why in the IR you
don't see averaging when you 

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.467
do see it in the NMR. Because
the NMR differences in 

00:34:41.467 --> 00:34:44.433
frequency are small, just a few
Hz or a 

00:34:44.433 --> 00:34:46.133
few hundreds of Hz. 

00:34:46.133 --> 00:34:49.100
So if something happens in a
hundredth of a second, you can 

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:51.800
see separate peaks for it. 

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.200
But you can't do that in the IR
because the differences in 

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.633
frequency are so large. 

00:34:56.633 --> 00:35:00.400
So this gives rise to what's
called the NMR time scale. 

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.900
Now suppose you had
cyclohexane-d11. 

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.867
It gives this spectrum. 

00:35:06.867 --> 00:35:13.367
It gives a spectrum for axial
and equatorial hydrogens. 

00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:16.667
Incidentally, notice that that's
sort of as if this were 

00:35:16.667 --> 00:35:18.533
like benzene with the ring
current. 

00:35:18.533 --> 00:35:22.067
It gets shifted down when it's
out the side, and shifted up 

00:35:22.067 --> 00:35:24.367
when it's along the axis. 

00:35:24.367 --> 00:35:26.233
At least, that's a way to
remember it. 

00:35:26.233 --> 00:35:28.267
I'm not really sure that that's
the explanation. 

00:35:28.267 --> 00:35:32.033
I'm not really sure that ring
current is true. 

00:35:32.033 --> 00:35:35.733
But anyhow, you can remember
which is which if you want to. 

00:35:35.733 --> 00:35:40.367
Now notice this is a special
molecule, d11 

00:35:40.367 --> 00:35:41.800
just one proton. 

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.500
And the reason is that you would
get very complicated spin-spin 

00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.533
splitting if these are all
hydrogen. 

00:35:47.533 --> 00:35:51.000
Because the axial will be split
by that, this equatorial 

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.633
will be split by that axial one.

00:35:53.633 --> 00:35:56.433
Because they don't have the same
chemical shift, so 

00:35:56.433 --> 00:35:58.000
they're going to split one
another. 

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.867
And then they'll also be split
by these with different 

00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:02.033
coupling constants and so on. 

00:36:02.033 --> 00:36:04.967
So if we make all those
deuterium, we get sharper 

00:36:04.967 --> 00:36:06.833
peaks so we can study it. 

00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:08.967
So it's d11. 

00:36:08.967 --> 00:36:13.933
But notice this is at minus 89
degrees centigrade. 

00:36:13.933 --> 00:36:17.467
And watch what happens if you
start warming up. 

00:36:17.467 --> 00:36:23.800
The difference in chemical shift
is point 0.48 ppm, 

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:29.167
and this was measured in an old
spectrometer in 1964 

00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:31.333
by Frank Bovey at Bell Labs. 

00:36:31.333 --> 00:36:33.833
And the difference here is 0.48
ppm 

00:36:33.833 --> 00:36:35.667
at 60 MHz, 

00:36:35.667 --> 00:36:37.800
or it's 29 Hz. 

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.133
We have to put it in frequency.
If we want to talk about this 

00:36:40.133 --> 00:36:40.967
kind of thing. 

00:36:40.967 --> 00:36:43.633
So 29 Hz difference in
frequency. 

00:36:43.633 --> 00:36:46.067
Now we go from -89 dregrees to
-68 degrees. 

00:36:46.067 --> 00:36:49.000
The peaks get broad. 

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.567
To -63 degrees, broader still
and moving in. 

00:36:53.567 --> 00:36:56.100
At 60 they coalesce and become a
single 

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:57.633
peak at -60 degrees. 

00:36:57.633 --> 00:37:01.300
At -57 degrees, it starts
sharpening up, and sharpened 

00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.000
up still more at -49 degrees. 

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.033
And what do you think it looks
like at room temperature? 

00:37:06.033 --> 00:37:08.133
A single, really sharp peak 

00:37:08.133 --> 00:37:10.267
as sharp as these or sharper. 

00:37:10.267 --> 00:37:12.500
So it's a single sharp peak up
there. 

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:18.100
Even if you have C6H12 because
it's flipping back and forth 

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:22.133
rapidly enough that it's
averaging the chemical shifts. 

00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:26.700
And once the chemical shifts
become the same on average, 

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.633
then you can't see the splitting
anymore. 

00:37:30.633 --> 00:37:33.300
So cyclohexane gives a single
sharp peak. 

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:36.700
But this allows you to tell how
fast, because you know 

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:38.733
this frequency difference. 

00:37:38.733 --> 00:37:44.133
So it turns out that they
coalesce to give a single peak 

00:37:44.133 --> 00:37:45.767
when it's at about that same-- 

00:37:45.767 --> 00:37:47.800
the lifetime is about the same
as that. 

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:52.300
It's actually four times that,
but for qualitative purposes 

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:55.467
it's the same at the time they
coalesce. 

00:37:55.467 --> 00:38:01.033
So it's about 100 times a second
that it's flipping back 

00:38:01.033 --> 00:38:03.567
and forth at -60 degrees. 

00:38:03.567 --> 00:38:06.333
But you can measure this, you
can fit these lines to 

00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:09.967
theoretical calculations for
rates at other temperatures. 

00:38:09.967 --> 00:38:13.300
Or you can go to a different
spectrometer which has the 

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.233
same chemical shift difference,
but a bigger 

00:38:15.233 --> 00:38:16.833
frequency difference. 

00:38:16.833 --> 00:38:18.967
And then get at what temperature
you'd have that 

00:38:18.967 --> 00:38:22.300
frequency, or four times that
frequency. 

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.333
So that's a great way to measure
the rates, and by 

00:38:24.333 --> 00:38:26.567
measuring the rates at different
temperatures, you 

00:38:26.567 --> 00:38:28.433
can get what the barrier is. 

00:38:28.433 --> 00:38:31.500
And that's where we got the
number from last semester. When

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:33.767
we were talking about
conformational analysis. 

00:38:33.767 --> 00:38:37.067
We said that the barrier for
flipping one chair to another 

00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:40.600
in cyclohexane is 10.5
kcal/mole, and 

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.567
that's where you get it. 

00:38:41.567 --> 00:38:44.700
It's not easy to measure
something like that, but NMR 

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.100
allows you to do it. 

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:51.400
So this is a handy way to
measure really fast rates and 

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.800
very small barriers that
correspond 

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.133
to these fast rates. 

00:38:55.133 --> 00:39:00.233
So the NMR application in
dynamics is very important for 

00:39:00.233 --> 00:39:05.633
studying fast rate processes. 

00:39:05.633 --> 00:39:07.467
Let me see how much time. 

00:39:07.467 --> 00:39:09.867
Let me just go very quickly, I'm
going to go really quickly 

00:39:09.867 --> 00:39:12.433
through this so we can get to a
little bit 

00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:13.033
of something else. 

00:39:13.033 --> 00:39:14.767
But this was the kind of
question that I 

00:39:14.767 --> 00:39:17.200
might ask on an exam. 

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.467
The first part, Question 1, had
to do 

00:39:19.467 --> 00:39:21.400
with making this molecule. 

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.233
We've talked about making
hemiacetals before. 

00:39:24.233 --> 00:39:27.433
But the relevant part here is
Question 2, which was to 

00:39:27.433 --> 00:39:29.867
sketch what you'd expect for the
NMR 

00:39:29.867 --> 00:39:33.500
spectrum of that compound. 

00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.267
So let's look at the different
groups and you predict what 

00:39:38.267 --> 00:39:40.067
we're going to get in terms of
chemical shift. 

00:39:40.067 --> 00:39:42.767
First, (a). How about its
chemical shift, where do you 

00:39:42.767 --> 00:39:44.400
expect it on the spectrum? 

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.133
The OH? 

00:39:45.133 --> 00:39:46.133
STUDENT: Downfield. 

00:39:46.133 --> 00:39:48.433
PROFESSOR: It'll be downfield
because of the O, but it'll be 

00:39:48.433 --> 00:39:51.200
almost any place because of the
hydrogen bonding and so 

00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:52.867
on, that has a big range. 

00:39:52.867 --> 00:39:56.067
And how about the splitting? 

00:39:56.067 --> 00:39:59.367
Should it be a singlet, a
doublet, a triplet? 

00:39:59.367 --> 00:40:00.633
quartet, quintet? 

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.200
1:4:6:4:1? 

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.933
What determines the splitting of
this? 

00:40:09.933 --> 00:40:12.567
How many protons are on the next
adjacent atom. 

00:40:15.167 --> 00:40:20.567
So we couple through this bond,
this bond, to here. 

00:40:20.567 --> 00:40:22.167
These are too far away. 

00:40:22.167 --> 00:40:26.933
Those are removed by one, two,
three, four bonds. 

00:40:26.933 --> 00:40:31.200
But to here, it's only one, two,
three bonds. 

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:34.300
So it should be a doublet,
right? 

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:35.600
Everybody agree it should be a
doublet? 

00:40:39.067 --> 00:40:41.267
Sebastian, you shake your head
slightly. 

00:40:41.267 --> 00:40:44.000
STUDENT: Well, it depends on
what the solvent is. 

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
PROFESSOR: Ah, in DMSO, it would
be a doublet. 

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.533
But mostly, you don't use that.

00:40:48.533 --> 00:40:52.433
And in chloroform, it would be
exchanging so you wouldn't see 

00:40:52.433 --> 00:40:53.767
the splitting. 

00:40:53.767 --> 00:40:56.833
So it could be almost any place
between 1 and 6 for 

00:40:56.833 --> 00:40:59.167
hydrogen bonding, and the
splitting is...

00:40:59.167 --> 00:41:01.467
probably it would
be a broad singlet

00:41:01.467 --> 00:41:03.800
because of rapid OH exchange. 

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.433
OK, now let's go to (b). Where
should that 

00:41:06.433 --> 00:41:10.000
be, chemical shift? 

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.067
Way at the right, way at the
left, in the middle, 

00:41:14.067 --> 00:41:15.633
almost to the right? 

00:41:15.633 --> 00:41:17.133
STUDENT: Way at the right. 

00:41:17.133 --> 00:41:21.467
PROFESSOR: So it's hydrogens
that are on a carbon and the 

00:41:21.467 --> 00:41:23.567
next atom is carbon too. 

00:41:23.567 --> 00:41:25.200
That's up at the right. 

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.200
But it has a couple oxygens
here. 

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.967
So it'll be shifted down a
little bit. 

00:41:30.967 --> 00:41:33.600
Slightly deshielded by two
oxygen atoms on the 

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.000
neighboring carbon. 

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.667
So one might predict someplace
between 1 and 2, and 

00:41:39.667 --> 00:41:43.167
there's a compound that's very
like that, that is at 1.3. 

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.400
OK, how about the splitting? 

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.000
This one? 

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.167
Now it has three bonds to get
from here to here. 

00:41:51.167 --> 00:41:54.700
So that should be a splitting,
there's no exchanging there. 

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.600
So it should be a 1:1 doublet,
split by-- 

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.567
and the J should be about 7 Hz.

00:42:00.567 --> 00:42:03.167
OK, now how about (c), what
should it look like? 

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:11.800
What should its chemical shift
be, relative 

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.033
to, say, these hydrogens? 

00:42:13.033 --> 00:42:14.667
STUDENT: A doublet of
quadruplets. 

00:42:14.667 --> 00:42:16.500
PROFESSOR: Derek what did you
say? 

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.267
DERRICK: I said a doublet of
quadruplets. 

00:42:18.267 --> 00:42:19.867
PROFESSOR: Not the splitting,
where should the chemical 

00:42:19.867 --> 00:42:21.900
shift be first? 

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.733
DERRICK: In the middle. 

00:42:23.733 --> 00:42:26.400
PROFESSOR: It's attached to a
carbon. 

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.867
What's that carbon attached to.

00:42:27.867 --> 00:42:28.200
Amy? 

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.367
AMY: Oxygens. 

00:42:29.367 --> 00:42:29.900
PROFESSOR: They are oxygens. 

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.100
So it'll be shifted down more
than this one was. 

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:36.533
Because it's closer to the
oxygens. 

00:42:36.533 --> 00:42:38.900
So it's deshielded by two oxygen

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.767
atoms on the same carbon. 

00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:46.067
So it would be between 4.5-
there's an analog 

00:42:46.067 --> 00:42:47.800
that's at 4.7. 

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.533
Now how about, Derek, now you
tell us about the 

00:42:49.533 --> 00:42:50.900
splitting of this one. 

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.233
STUDENT: I think it's a doublet
of quadruplets-- or a 

00:42:54.233 --> 00:42:54.833
quadruplet of doublets. 

00:42:54.833 --> 00:42:55.200
I don't know how to-- 

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.500
PROFESSOR: It would be -- if it
were split by this, that makes

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.533
it a quartet.

00:43:00.533 --> 00:43:01.200
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.867
PROFESSOR: And this would make
it a doublet, except we already

00:43:03.867 --> 00:43:05.267
said that that's probably
exchanging. 

00:43:05.267 --> 00:43:07.233
It would depend on the solvent.

00:43:07.233 --> 00:43:12.167
So probably it would just be a
1:3:3:1 quartet. 

00:43:12.167 --> 00:43:13.200
J about 7 Hz. 

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.133
OK, let's keep going. 

00:43:14.133 --> 00:43:15.767
How about this one? 

00:43:15.767 --> 00:43:18.400
What's that going to be like? 

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.633
Jack? 

00:43:21.767 --> 00:43:24.933
Chemical shift for that CH3? 

00:43:24.933 --> 00:43:25.567
STUDENT: 2. 

00:43:25.567 --> 00:43:28.433
PROFESSOR: Maybe about 2,
because it's attached to a 

00:43:28.433 --> 00:43:31.767
carbon which bears oxygen. 

00:43:31.767 --> 00:43:33.633
So slightly deshielded by the
oxygen. 

00:43:33.633 --> 00:43:36.167
That's rather like this one,
which is attached to a carbon 

00:43:36.167 --> 00:43:37.667
which bore two oxygens. 

00:43:37.667 --> 00:43:40.133
So not as far down as that. 

00:43:40.133 --> 00:43:41.967
1.1. 

00:43:41.967 --> 00:43:45.067
And how about the splitting of
that one, Jack? 

00:43:45.067 --> 00:43:47.000
STUDENT: It would be a doublet.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.033
PROFESSOR: Just a doublet,
because 

00:43:48.033 --> 00:43:50.567
these are too far away. 

00:43:50.567 --> 00:43:52.500
1:1 doublet, 7 Hz. 

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.867
OK, now let's go to (e). What's
it going to look like? 

00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:58.167
How about its chemical shift? 

00:43:58.167 --> 00:43:59.600
Debby? 

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.167
STUDENT: It would be like 4? 

00:44:02.167 --> 00:44:03.600
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because it's
got an 

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:06.267
oxygen on the same carbon. 

00:44:06.267 --> 00:44:08.833
So it's 3.8. 

00:44:08.833 --> 00:44:10.600
Not bad. 

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.767
And how about its multiplicity?

00:44:12.767 --> 00:44:16.500
How many hydrogens splitting it
three bonds away? 

00:44:19.667 --> 00:44:21.100
I can't hear very well. 

00:44:27.367 --> 00:44:29.300
STUDENT: It would be...
I don't know.

00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.367
PROFESSOR: Well, we already said
that this one is going to 

00:44:32.367 --> 00:44:34.800
be a doublet split by that. 

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.200
If that's true-- 

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.833
if this one splits these, then
these split that. 

00:44:39.833 --> 00:44:40.733
STUDENT: So do the top ones. 

00:44:40.733 --> 00:44:42.600
PROFESSOR: So do the top ones. 

00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.967
So how many altogether? 

00:44:44.967 --> 00:44:47.200
STUDENT: So it's six hydrogens,
so its-- 

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.667
PROFESSOR: So it'll be seven
lines in 

00:44:48.667 --> 00:44:51.033
the binomial intensity. 

00:44:51.033 --> 00:44:53.533
Seven line multiplet from the
six atoms on 

00:44:53.533 --> 00:44:54.833
the neighboring carbons. 

00:44:54.833 --> 00:44:55.300
7 Hz. 

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.800
So that's going to be really, a
whole bunch of them. 

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.333
Seven lines. 

00:44:59.333 --> 00:45:01.567
OK, now how about (f)? 

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.800
STUDENT: Like (d)? 

00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:06.567
PROFESSOR: Chris? 

00:45:06.567 --> 00:45:07.867
STUDENT: Same as (d). 

00:45:07.867 --> 00:45:10.667
PROFESSOR: Ah, same as (d). It's
got the same connectivity as 

00:45:10.667 --> 00:45:13.933
(d), same hydrogen coupling and
so on. 

00:45:13.933 --> 00:45:18.467
But it's slightly deshielded by
the oxygen atom there-- so 

00:45:18.467 --> 00:45:20.367
I copied that from here. 

00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:23.133
And I copied this from here, and
that's what you said. 

00:45:23.133 --> 00:45:27.500
But it's different from (d)
because 

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.867
here is a chiral center. 

00:45:30.867 --> 00:45:35.833
So one of those is pro-R and the
other is pro-S. They're 

00:45:35.833 --> 00:45:37.933
different within another chiral
center. 

00:45:37.933 --> 00:45:40.400
So in fact, when you look at a
situation like that, there are 

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.000
two that are really close to one
another. 

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.200
Two doublets. 

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.600
They're about the same, but I
caught you. 

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.200
STUDENT: Can you see that? 

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.933
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you do see
that. 

00:45:51.933 --> 00:45:53.633
Not in every molecule. 

00:45:53.633 --> 00:45:57.567
Notice it's an isopropyl group,
two CH3s on a CH 

00:45:57.567 --> 00:45:58.767
attached to something. 

00:45:58.767 --> 00:46:01.300
If the rest of the molecule is
chiral, 

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.333
those will be different. 

00:46:03.333 --> 00:46:04.333
CHRIS: By how much? 

00:46:04.333 --> 00:46:06.567
PROFESSOR: That depends on what
the molecule is. 

00:46:06.567 --> 00:46:09.200
It's sometimes hardly
observable. 

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.800
But very often, you can see it.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:13.300
I saw one, when I was a graduate
student I got a 

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:14.667
spectrum like that. 

00:46:14.667 --> 00:46:17.033
I said, what the heck is going
on? 

00:46:17.033 --> 00:46:19.733
So that was a standard question
I would ask on exams 

00:46:19.733 --> 00:46:22.433
down here of graduate students
at that time, after 

00:46:22.433 --> 00:46:25.367
I learned it myself. 

00:46:25.367 --> 00:46:26.633
OK now, proton decoupling. 

00:46:28.633 --> 00:46:31.467
Let me just start this, and then
we'll show the 

00:46:31.467 --> 00:46:33.000
example next time. 

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.500
So we have JC13-H here. 

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.667
Now notice that when we put this
in a certain magnetic field, 

00:46:39.667 --> 00:46:42.600
the proton will precess at 100
MHz. 

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:43.967
How about the C-13? 

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:46.700
Will it precess at 100 MHz? 

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.600
No, because it's a much weaker
magnet. 

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.267
It doesn't feel as much torque,
it doesn't precess as 

00:46:52.267 --> 00:46:53.667
fast. 

00:46:53.667 --> 00:46:58.500
So the H has a steady field in
that direction. 

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.467
Or there are other ones that
have exactly the same steady 

00:47:01.467 --> 00:47:03.567
field in the opposite direction.

00:47:03.567 --> 00:47:08.400
Now C-13 is 25 MHz, it's only a
quarter 

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.033
as strong as a magnet. 

00:47:10.033 --> 00:47:15.000
So it precesses much more
slowly, it's a smaller magnet, 

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.567
and it can be either up or down.

00:47:18.567 --> 00:47:20.700
So both these things are
happening when we put it in a 

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:22.567
magnetic field. 

00:47:22.567 --> 00:47:25.700
And here's the NMR spectrum, and
we've seen that, and saw 

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.900
the satellites-- 

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:34.300
this peak comes from C-12s. 

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:38.467
This is from C-13s when they're
down, and this is the proton 

00:47:38.467 --> 00:47:44.233
precession when the C-13 is up,
reinforcing the applied field. 

00:47:44.233 --> 00:47:47.333
And at the same time, if we
looked at the C-13 spectrum, 

00:47:47.333 --> 00:47:51.333
notice that essentially all of
hydrogen is protium. 

00:47:51.333 --> 00:47:55.633
Only 0.015%, very little, is
deuterium. 

00:47:55.633 --> 00:47:58.300
So you don't see that big peak
in the middle here, because 

00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:02.833
all the hydrogen is either this
way or this way. 

00:48:02.833 --> 00:48:05.433
And the magnitude of the
splitting in both 

00:48:05.433 --> 00:48:10.333
cases is 125 Hz, that's fine. 

00:48:10.333 --> 00:48:13.833
So now, suppose we do something
really cute. 

00:48:13.833 --> 00:48:18.133
Suppose we put two radio
frequencies in. 

00:48:18.133 --> 00:48:22.533
One at 100 MHz, one at 25 MHz. 

00:48:22.533 --> 00:48:24.367
But what we're going to do--

00:48:24.367 --> 00:48:26.833
the way we're going to do it is
to irradiate 100

00:48:26.833 --> 00:48:29.833
MHz all the time. 

00:48:29.833 --> 00:48:36.500
But just do a pulse, a 90 degree
pulse. Of the C-13 to twist it

00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:38.567
down into the plane, and then
allow it to precess.

00:48:38.567 --> 00:48:39.967
And that's what we're going to
listen to 

00:48:39.967 --> 00:48:41.533
see if we got a signal. 

00:48:41.533 --> 00:48:46.567
We're going to listen to the
C-13 while irradiating the H. 

00:48:46.567 --> 00:48:48.000
Now what effect does that have,
then? 

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.800
If you were in a frame rotating
at 100 MHz, 

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:54.300
you'd see that this little 100
MHz field is going to 

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.967
cause the hydrogens to precess
like this. 

00:48:58.967 --> 00:49:02.667
To go up, down, up, down, up,
down. 

00:49:02.667 --> 00:49:05.233
What determines how fast they go
up and down? 

00:49:05.233 --> 00:49:07.100
How fast they precess? 

00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:08.367
What determines that? 

00:49:10.567 --> 00:49:12.500
It's how big this field is. 

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.967
How strong the field is. 

00:49:14.967 --> 00:49:18.067
The stronger the field, the
faster the precession. 

00:49:18.067 --> 00:49:20.567
So that means H is going to be
up, then down, 

00:49:20.567 --> 00:49:21.967
then up, then down. 

00:49:21.967 --> 00:49:24.933
And how fast it's going up,
down, up, down, up, down 

00:49:24.933 --> 00:49:27.433
depends on how much power we put
into our radio. 

00:49:31.033 --> 00:49:35.133
If we do it fast enough, we see
the average of the C-13 and 

00:49:35.133 --> 00:49:36.667
decouple the spectrum. 

00:49:36.667 --> 00:49:40.733
We can see the C-13 spectrum
without the H splitting it, by 

00:49:40.733 --> 00:49:43.100
making the H's quickly go up and
down. 

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.833
How fast do they have to go up
and down in order to average 

00:49:47.833 --> 00:49:51.367
the 125 Hz splitting to be
nothing, to 

00:49:51.367 --> 00:49:52.633
just be a single peak? 

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:57.400
How fast? 

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.467
Once you've had time to review
the lecture, you'll be able to 

00:49:59.467 --> 00:49:59.967
answer that. 

00:49:59.967 --> 00:50:00.933
STUDENT: 125. 

00:50:00.933 --> 00:50:04.633
PROFESSOR: About 125 times a
second, right? 

00:50:04.633 --> 00:50:06.333
The frequency difference is how
fast you 

00:50:06.333 --> 00:50:09.267
have to flip to average. 

00:50:09.267 --> 00:50:12.700
So if you put enough power in on
the hydrogen, you remove 

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:15.967
the splitting from the C-13
spectrum, which can be handy, 

00:50:15.967 --> 00:50:17.300
as we'll show you next time. 

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.533
So the decoupling power
determines the rate of this 

00:50:23.533 --> 00:50:24.667
precession. 

00:50:24.667 --> 00:50:27.033
And this, we'll see next time.

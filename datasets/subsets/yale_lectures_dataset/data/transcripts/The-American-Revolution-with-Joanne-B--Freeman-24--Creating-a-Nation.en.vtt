00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.949
Prof: On Thursday,
I gave the world's most

00:00:05.949 --> 00:00:10.230
condensed lecture about the
Constitution,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.096
and I mentioned three
controversies that represented

00:00:14.096 --> 00:00:17.660
long-standing concerns in
Revolutionary America:

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.074
the question of representation,
the problem of slavery,

00:00:22.074 --> 00:00:25.590
and then the question of a
national executive--

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.445
so that really boils down to
the problem of investing power

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:30.310
in one man.
 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.614
Now I did manage to discuss all
three of those things briefly

00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:36.910
before the end of the lecture.
 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.379
I did not have time to discuss
one last issue,

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.618
which I do want to talk about
here before I go into the real

00:00:42.618 --> 00:00:44.210
topic of today's lecture.
 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.710
I just ran out of time.
 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.530
And it actually combines two of
those issues.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.842
It's the combination of the
problem of representation and

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:54.647
the problem of slavery,
and it's something you've all

00:00:54.647 --> 00:00:57.152
studied in high school,
I am sure, and that is the

00:00:57.152 --> 00:00:58.510
Three-Fifths Compromise.
 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.420
And in a sentence,
the Three-Fifths Compromise is

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.635
the decision to count
three-fifths of a state's slaves

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:08.905
in apportioning representatives,
presidential electors and

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:10.040
direct taxes.
 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.069
So obviously by doing that--and
that is a compromise of sorts--

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.194
it is trying to grapple with
the problem of slavery and the

00:01:17.194 --> 00:01:20.168
question of representation,
but obviously that's a

00:01:20.168 --> 00:01:23.319
compromise that bolsters
Southern political power.

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:28.055
Now the great historian of
slavery, Yale professor emeritus

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.729
David Brion Davis,
has this little calculation

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.260
associated with this issue.
 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.836
Davis writes that in the
Continental Congress there had

00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:41.810
been five states in which
slavery was a major institution.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.407
So the Southern states in the
Continental Congress had about

00:01:45.407 --> 00:01:48.640
thirty-eight percent of the
seats in that Congress.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.010
Because of the Three-Fifths
Compromise, when the first U.S.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.530
Congress opened under the new
Constitution,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.796
Southern states now had
forty-five percent of the seats

00:01:58.796 --> 00:02:01.115
in the House,
so thirty-eight to forty-five

00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:01.989
is a significant slide.
 

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:04.599
Now that doesn't stay ingrained
that way,

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:07.608
because population increases in
the North and things change over

00:02:07.608 --> 00:02:09.919
time,
but certainly that's one way in

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:13.780
which you can see the impact of
that Three-Fifths Compromise.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.290
Now in a way that
Compromise--it's a great segue

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.019
into my lecture today--
it's a great example of the

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.806
larger dynamic of the period
that we're focusing on here

00:02:24.806 --> 00:02:27.008
toward the end of the course.
 

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:30.145
Because, as we've been looking
at in the Constitutional

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:32.512
Convention--
as we're going to see today

00:02:32.512 --> 00:02:34.639
when we're looking at
ratification--

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.756
at the heart of the political
developments that we're looking

00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:42.872
at in this period is compromise:
compromise between North and

00:02:42.872 --> 00:02:45.799
South;
compromise between big states

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.060
and small states;
compromise between people who

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.672
want to centralize power and
people who want strong state

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:53.639
governments.
 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:58.443
So basically what we're looking
at in this period is Americans

00:02:58.443 --> 00:03:01.750
deciding where and how to invest
power,

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.736
obviously a highly charged
decision that would have been

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:09.580
impossible to make without a
string of compromises.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.626
And in a way,
as we're going to be discussing

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:14.849
today,
this is sort of a fundamental

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.942
question at the heart of the
Revolution and its immediate

00:03:17.942 --> 00:03:18.658
aftermath.
 

00:03:18.658 --> 00:03:20.639
Where should the nation invest
power?

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.780
Where does power go?
 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.420
So in a way,
if you look back to the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.677
beginning of the course,
think about the Revolution,

00:03:28.677 --> 00:03:30.530
think about some of the central
issues,

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.111
you could say that the
Revolution certainly was about

00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:33.508
power.
 

00:03:33.508 --> 00:03:33.861
Right?
 

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:37.330
It was a rebellion against what
many perceived as tyrannical

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.228
power,
and that means a lot of things

00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:40.930
but to sum that all up in a
sentence,

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.190
you could say that.
 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.394
You could say that the 1770s
and then the 1780s show

00:03:46.394 --> 00:03:51.423
Americans trying to figure out
how to rebalance and reorganize

00:03:51.423 --> 00:03:53.724
power--
the power of state--that they

00:03:53.724 --> 00:03:56.322
strip away the British
administration and now they have

00:03:56.322 --> 00:03:59.065
to figure out where else to
place power and how to balance

00:03:59.065 --> 00:03:59.449
it.
 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.671
And we've seen the Articles of
Confederation and now the

00:04:02.671 --> 00:04:05.258
Constitution,
which is again part of this

00:04:05.258 --> 00:04:08.741
ongoing dialogue trying to
figure out the balance of power

00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:10.818
in all sorts of different ways.
 

00:04:10.818 --> 00:04:13.935
And it's no wonder--if you
think about what I've already

00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:17.389
just talked about as far as the
Constitution is concerned--

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.805
it's no wonder that it demanded
a string of difficult and often

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:23.730
experimental compromises.
 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.483
Creating the Constitution
and--as we'll see

00:04:26.483 --> 00:04:29.632
today--ratifying the
Constitution was a difficult

00:04:29.632 --> 00:04:30.420
process.
 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.288
We tend to think of the outcome
and we don't think of the

00:04:34.288 --> 00:04:36.656
process,
And I'm always reminded of this

00:04:36.656 --> 00:04:39.766
fact when I read an exchange of
letters between Jefferson and

00:04:39.766 --> 00:04:41.711
Madison,
and it's actually written not

00:04:41.711 --> 00:04:43.810
long after the Constitution goes
into effect.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.550
I think it's written in early
1790,

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.009
and at that point Jefferson had
been overseas,

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.779
he'd been in France on
diplomatic duty,

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.730
so he's off in the distance
knowing that they're debating

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.889
the Constitution in the United
States,

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.338
but he's on foreign shores,
lounging in salons,

00:05:01.338 --> 00:05:03.949
chatting about philosophical
issues with the French.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.129
Meanwhile, Madison is in the
Constitutional Convention

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.459
slaving away,
and then he's outside of it

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.540
sort of hammering away at
ratification,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.040
so Madison's clawing over the
issue of the Constitution;

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.360
Jefferson's kind of looking
from afar.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.754
So he writes this letter to
Madison early 1790 saying that

00:05:21.754 --> 00:05:26.302
no generation should be bound to
the actions of any previous

00:05:26.302 --> 00:05:27.459
generation.
 

00:05:27.459 --> 00:05:29.423
It's one of those Jefferson
letters in which he's like:

00:05:29.423 --> 00:05:31.858
'I have an interesting idea,
let me share it with you,' and

00:05:31.858 --> 00:05:34.300
he starts out with this sort of
idea about generations.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.803
Each generation is a distinct
thing and should never be bound

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:41.250
by the one that came before--and
it has this famous line.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.281
Some of you may have heard it
already: "The earth belongs

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:44.529
...
 

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:47.266
to the living,"
right?--that the living should

00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:50.375
be controlling things;
the dead hand of the past

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:53.180
should not have weight in the
present.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.673
In typical Jefferson style he
then calculates what a

00:05:56.673 --> 00:05:57.769
generation is.
 

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:58.012
Right?
 

00:05:58.012 --> 00:06:00.000
It's not enough to say
generations are distinct.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.343
He says, Well,
how long is a generation

00:06:02.343 --> 00:06:02.899
anyway?
 

00:06:02.899 --> 00:06:04.079
I will calculate this out.
 

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:07.480
Oh, a generation is nineteen
years'--by Thomas Jefferson.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.249
So he decides a generation is
nineteen years and then says to

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:14.139
Madison, 'So every nineteen
years we need a new

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:15.269
Constitution.'
 

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:18.379
[laughs] Okay.
 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:20.021
So Jefferson,
writing to the

00:06:20.021 --> 00:06:23.425
slaving-away-Constitution guy,
says, 'Let's do this every

00:06:23.425 --> 00:06:24.579
nineteen years.
 

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:25.910
I think that would be much
fairer.

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.170
It wouldn't bind the present to
the past.'

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.290
Now when I read that letter and
then I read Madison's response,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.699
Madison is really tactful.
 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.185
Madison's a tactful guy,
and he's tactful in his

00:06:35.185 --> 00:06:37.920
response,
but when you look beneath the

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.411
surface of Madison's reply,
I always feel like what you see

00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:43.389
there is this sustained howl of
disbelief,

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:45.610
like: 'What!?
 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.740
Yeah, you try that next time,
Teej, and then you come back

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.870
here and tell me you want to do
that in nineteen years.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.444
[laughter]
No.' So Madison's not happy

00:06:54.444 --> 00:06:57.160
about it but he actually is
tactful,

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.689
and what he says to Jefferson
is, he praises Jefferson's,

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:04.600
quote, "many interesting
reflections."

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.319
[laughs]
It's like: 'Thank you,

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:09.069
Mr. Madison'--and then adds,
unfortunately,

00:07:09.069 --> 00:07:12.454
quote, they are "not in
all respects compatible with the

00:07:12.454 --> 00:07:15.389
course of human affairs,"
or in other words,

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:18.490
real people don't act that way
[laughs]--

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:21.512
like Jefferson,
nice idea, not going to work in

00:07:21.512 --> 00:07:22.629
implementation.
 

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:24.269
That's not for real life.
 

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:25.935
For real people,
it doesn't work,

00:07:25.935 --> 00:07:27.360
but cute idea;
keep them coming.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.620
Like, it's interesting.
 

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.110
We can just keep the
conversation going;

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.180
we're not doing another
Constitution in nineteen years.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.584
So that's certainly one
compromise that Madison is not

00:07:36.584 --> 00:07:40.519
willing to sign on to,
but of course the compromises

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:44.860
don't end with the closing of
the Federal Convention.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.459
Creating the Constitution is a
major accomplishment.

00:07:47.459 --> 00:07:49.370
Now it has to be ratified.
 

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:53.709
There needed to be nine states
to ratify it for it to go into

00:07:53.709 --> 00:07:57.327
effect, and each state would
have its own ratifying

00:07:57.327 --> 00:07:59.860
convention to decide the issue.
 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.711
Now things would have been
difficult enough if that was the

00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:07.172
only challenge at hand--
if all that they were facing

00:08:07.172 --> 00:08:09.709
was ratification debates in the
states--

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:12.843
but the fact is,
there were a slew of things

00:08:12.843 --> 00:08:16.779
that could have gone wrong even
before we got to actual

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:18.019
ratification.
 

00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:20.237
For one thing,
the Confederation Congress

00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:23.509
might just disapprove of the
Constitution and refuse to send

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:24.839
it on to the states.
 

00:08:24.839 --> 00:08:28.194
It was entirely possible that
the Congress might have said,

00:08:28.194 --> 00:08:30.970
'You know, you didn't just
amend the Articles.

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:31.800
You wrote a new Constitution.
 

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.519
I'm sorry.
 

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:33.620
We don't consider that valid.
 

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.158
Nice try.
 

00:08:35.158 --> 00:08:37.513
We're not going to send it
on'--and that would have been a

00:08:37.513 --> 00:08:38.668
little interesting moment.
 

00:08:38.668 --> 00:08:43.047
It's just as possible that
individual states might refuse

00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:45.940
to consider it for the same
reason.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.269
And even if some states did
consider this Constitution and

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:54.467
did decide to ratify it,
if large influential states

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:58.765
like Virginia or Massachusetts
or New York rejected the

00:08:58.765 --> 00:09:02.346
Constitution,
their influence might actually

00:09:02.346 --> 00:09:06.724
compel other states to follow
their example and vote against

00:09:06.724 --> 00:09:07.168
it.
 

00:09:07.168 --> 00:09:10.058
So all of this is sort of
looming out there.

00:09:10.058 --> 00:09:12.070
It's unclear if any of this is
going to happen,

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:14.389
but for those who are really
supporting this new

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:17.001
Constitution,
they really knew that they had

00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:19.190
a pretty big challenge facing
them.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:23.308
If the Constitution made it to
the states for ratification,

00:09:23.308 --> 00:09:28.048
if the states agreed to
consider it,

00:09:28.048 --> 00:09:30.832
then they had to worry about
the actual debate over whether

00:09:30.832 --> 00:09:34.700
this Constitution was a just,
trustworthy division of power.

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.519
Now, the first horrible
possibility did not take place,

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:42.440
and the Confederation Congress
passes on the Constitution to

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.629
the states for consideration on
September 28,

00:09:45.629 --> 00:09:49.494
1787, but still,
with the question of

00:09:49.494 --> 00:09:53.736
ratification looming,
clearly the fate of the

00:09:53.736 --> 00:09:57.580
Constitution is left hanging for
a good many months.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.519
And I mentioned last time I was
going to go back to Ezra Stiles,

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:02.678
because his diary is useful and
wonderful--

00:10:02.678 --> 00:10:05.720
and I'm going to go right back
here to Ezra Stiles just for a

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.428
few minutes.
 

00:10:06.428 --> 00:10:10.610
Because his diary shows you one
man--

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.500
certainly one elite,
highly educated,

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.860
influential man with very
high-placed friends--

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:18.240
but still one man who is
watching events unfold related

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.403
to the Constitution,
and is trying to figure out

00:10:21.403 --> 00:10:23.129
what he thinks about them.
 

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:24.610
He's interested to know what's
happening.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.537
He's not sure what he thinks
and he's trying to figure this

00:10:27.537 --> 00:10:27.840
out.
 

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.812
So one thing that his diary
shows is that certainly he was

00:10:30.812 --> 00:10:33.732
intensely interested in whatever
the heck was going on in

00:10:33.732 --> 00:10:34.620
Philadelphia.
 

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.056
He didn't know what was going
on in Philadelphia,

00:10:37.056 --> 00:10:38.629
but he really wanted to know.
 

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:40.722
And on June 19,
he apparently asked Yale

00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:43.298
College seniors to debate the
following question:

00:10:43.298 --> 00:10:46.519
"Whether the States acted
wisely in sending Delegates to

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:46.948
the Gen.
 

00:10:46.948 --> 00:10:49.740
Convention now sitting in
Philadelphia?"

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.740
I don't know what they're
doing, but Yale students,

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.860
debate amongst yourselves.
 

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.860
Do you think that was a good
idea?

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.288
In November of 1787,
the question that he poses for

00:10:59.288 --> 00:11:02.389
Yale College seniors has
changed.

00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:04.193
Now he says,
Yale College seniors,

00:11:04.193 --> 00:11:06.873
debate for yourself:
"Whether it is expedient

00:11:06.873 --> 00:11:09.879
for the States to adopt the new
Constitution?"

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:12.160
In late December,
some of his curiosity gets

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.184
satisfied because he actually
gets to spend the night with

00:11:15.184 --> 00:11:17.645
Abraham Baldwin,
who had been a delegate in the

00:11:17.645 --> 00:11:19.669
Convention,
so this is his chance.

00:11:19.669 --> 00:11:20.870
There's a guy who was there.
 

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.999
He's going to really sort of
plug away at Baldwin,

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:24.389
find out what really happened.
 

00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:28.389
And at the end of the evening
this is what Stiles wrote in his

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:31.155
diary:
"I have formed this as my

00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:31.808
Opinion.
 

00:11:31.808 --> 00:11:31.980
1.
 

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.408
That it is not the most perfect
Constitution yet 2.

00:11:36.408 --> 00:11:41.774
That it is a very good one,
&amp; that it is advisable to

00:11:41.774 --> 00:11:42.830
adopt it.
 

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:44.970
However, 3.
 

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.835
That tho' much of it will be
permanent &amp;

00:11:46.835 --> 00:11:49.351
lasting, yet much of it will be
hereafter altered by future

00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:49.960
Revisions.
 

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.350
And 4.
 

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:55.250
That the best one remains yet
to be investigated."

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.841
And then he goes on to add:
"When the Convention was

00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.149
proposed I doubted its
Expediency.

00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:01.250
1.
 

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.210
"--he's really a guy for
lists--

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:03.726
"1.
 

00:12:03.726 --> 00:12:07.349
Because I doubted whether our
wisest Men had yet attained

00:12:07.349 --> 00:12:10.259
Light eno' to see &amp;
discern the best,

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:12.870
&amp; what ought finally to
prevail.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.980
2.
 

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.297
Neither did I think the People
were ripe for the Reception of

00:12:16.297 --> 00:12:18.730
the best one if it could be
investigated.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.500
And yet 3.
 

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.610
I did not doubt but Time &amp;
future Experience would teach,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.528
open &amp; lead us to the best
one.

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:28.131
And tho' we have got a much
better one than I expected,

00:12:28.131 --> 00:12:30.590
&amp; a very good one,
yet my Judgt still remains as

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:31.408
before."
 

00:12:31.408 --> 00:12:32.940
And then he gets very specific,
and he says,

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.878
"I think there is not
Power enough yet given to

00:12:35.878 --> 00:12:38.009
Congress for firm
Government."

00:12:38.009 --> 00:12:39.080
So he thinks about that on the
one hand.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.673
At the same time he worries
that surrendering too much power

00:12:42.673 --> 00:12:44.990
to this new government will end
up,

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:47.746
quote, "prostratg the
Sovereignty of the particular

00:12:47.746 --> 00:12:48.500
States."
 

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.898
On the one hand,
he worries that the President

00:12:50.898 --> 00:12:53.190
might become,
quote, "an uncontrollable

00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:54.950
&amp; absolute Monarch."
 

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:58.610
On the other hand,
he says, "I think--

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.434
" --First he says,
"I think the last as well

00:13:00.434 --> 00:13:01.710
guarded as possible"
so yeah,

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.072
he might become a monarch,
but I think the Constitution

00:13:04.072 --> 00:13:06.610
did as well as it could to
prevent that from happening,

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:09.169
and then goes on to say,
"I know not whether it is

00:13:09.169 --> 00:13:11.019
possible to vest Congress with
Laws,

00:13:11.019 --> 00:13:12.970
Revenues, &amp;
Army &amp; Navy,

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.941
without endangering the Ruin of
the interior Powers &amp;

00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:17.639
Liberties of the States."
 

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:20.693
And that's a long passage for
someone to put in his own diary,

00:13:20.693 --> 00:13:23.697
but what's interesting about
that to me is you can see Stiles

00:13:23.697 --> 00:13:24.950
going back and forth.
 

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.340
He says it's good but there's
probably a better one;

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:30.075
it's better than I expected,
but somehow it's not good

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:32.056
enough;
it doesn't give enough power to

00:13:32.056 --> 00:13:35.087
Congress, but maybe it gives too
much power and the states will

00:13:35.087 --> 00:13:37.155
be prostrated;
maybe the President is too

00:13:37.155 --> 00:13:40.009
powerful, but if we give some of
that power to congress maybe

00:13:40.009 --> 00:13:42.529
Congress will end up really
destroying the states.

00:13:42.529 --> 00:13:45.133
So you can see him there sort
of reasoning through what he

00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:48.279
thinks about the Constitution,
and in one way or another,

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:50.990
it's boiling down to the
balance of power;

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.389
where should power be.
 

00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:54.798
He's not exactly sure where
power should be.

00:13:54.798 --> 00:13:57.692
He knows it's the issue,
but he's not quite sure how to

00:13:57.692 --> 00:13:58.710
find his way out.
 

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:02.970
So clearly--and Stiles is an
example of this--

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:07.312
although the delegates of the
Constitutional Convention had

00:14:07.312 --> 00:14:10.158
agreed on a new form of
government,

00:14:10.158 --> 00:14:14.152
there was certainly not some
huge, sweeping national

00:14:14.152 --> 00:14:18.847
consensus on the best kind of
government for the new American

00:14:18.847 --> 00:14:19.710
nation.
 

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:23.500
So the ratification debates
throughout the states--

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.690
except for Rhode Island,
which is not having a debate--

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.022
but in the rest of the states,
the ones that are actually

00:14:29.022 --> 00:14:33.220
having big ratification debates,
these are really real debates.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:37.668
And often, these debates
focused on the question of

00:14:37.668 --> 00:14:38.379
power.
 

00:14:38.379 --> 00:14:41.772
As suggested by Stiles,
one big question along these

00:14:41.772 --> 00:14:45.364
lines was: how do you divide
power between the national

00:14:45.364 --> 00:14:47.360
government and the states?
 

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.489
Patrick Henry of Virginia had
this to say about the

00:14:50.489 --> 00:14:52.993
Constitution,
even before he got past its

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.370
first three words.
 

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.894
Patrick Henry is upset by the
first three words of the

00:14:56.894 --> 00:14:57.610
Constitution.
 

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.690
This doesn't bode well for the
Virginia debate.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.240
Henry says,
"My political curiosity,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.575
exclusive of my anxious
solicitude for the public

00:15:05.575 --> 00:15:07.410
welfare,
leads me to ask,

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:10.558
who authorized them to speak
the language of,

00:15:10.558 --> 00:15:12.761
We, the People,
instead of We,

00:15:12.761 --> 00:15:13.750
the States?
 

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:17.580
States are the characteristics
and the soul of a confederation.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.259
If the states be not be agents
of this compact,

00:15:21.259 --> 00:15:24.538
it must be one great
consolidated national

00:15:24.538 --> 00:15:26.220
government."
 

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:29.720
Samuel Adams is more concise,
but has the same idea.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.462
He also--those first three
words--He can't get past the

00:15:32.462 --> 00:15:33.480
first three words.
 

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:36.456
He says, "As I enter the
Building I stumble at the

00:15:36.456 --> 00:15:37.450
Threshold."
 

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.440
Constitution--We, the people?
 

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.610
We, the people?
 

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:42.600
What is that?
 

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.720
What does that suggest about
this government?

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.895
They're both basically asking,
what kind of a government is

00:15:47.895 --> 00:15:48.279
this?
 

00:15:48.279 --> 00:15:51.240
It's not a league of states,
a confederation of states.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:53.820
It doesn't seem to be about the
states.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:57.155
It appears to be some kind of
new powerful national government

00:15:57.155 --> 00:16:00.110
linking itself with the American
people and potentially

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:02.899
dismissing the importance of
individual states.

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:06.690
In the minds of men like Henry
and Adams,

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.102
if this was a really federal
constitution surely the document

00:16:10.102 --> 00:16:12.610
should begin with "we,
the states"

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.788
as opposed to "we,
the people."

00:16:15.788 --> 00:16:18.259
What they're getting at--Henry
and Adams--

00:16:18.259 --> 00:16:22.110
in those kinds of statements is
one of the most unique aspects

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.702
of the proposed Constitution,
and I think in a sense its most

00:16:25.702 --> 00:16:26.820
brilliant compromise.
 

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.078
And that's the idea of
federalism: the idea that both

00:16:30.078 --> 00:16:33.464
the states and the national
government could have large

00:16:33.464 --> 00:16:36.910
areas of power with the federal
courts sort of acting as

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:40.610
arbiters about the limits of
state and federal power.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.458
The real brilliance of
federalism is that it suggested

00:16:44.458 --> 00:16:48.379
that sovereignty could be
divided between two levels of

00:16:48.379 --> 00:16:49.470
government.
 

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.970
That was an interesting idea.
 

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:53.941
It was one that many people
didn't believe could actually be

00:16:53.941 --> 00:16:55.653
put into play,
but it's a brilliant

00:16:55.653 --> 00:16:57.970
suggestion, a really brilliant
compromise.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.745
For a population of people who
were worried about the birth of

00:17:01.745 --> 00:17:05.400
some kind of tyrannical
centralized national government,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.078
the concept of federalism at
least had some potential.

00:17:09.078 --> 00:17:13.772
On the other hand,
the idea of nationalism was a

00:17:13.772 --> 00:17:16.068
lot more frightening.
 

00:17:16.068 --> 00:17:16.569
Right?
 

00:17:16.569 --> 00:17:20.660
Nationalism suggests one big
national blob and the

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:24.248
obliteration of states,
or as Stiles put it,

00:17:24.248 --> 00:17:27.170
the prostration of the states.
 

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.098
It's interesting to note that
in the Constitution,

00:17:29.098 --> 00:17:32.858
the word "national"
does not appear--

00:17:32.858 --> 00:17:34.258
and as a matter of fact,
not only is the word

00:17:34.258 --> 00:17:35.497
"national"
not in the original

00:17:35.497 --> 00:17:37.292
Constitution,
but during the debates when

00:17:37.292 --> 00:17:39.972
someone put it in,
somebody else always took it

00:17:39.972 --> 00:17:40.288
out.
 

00:17:40.288 --> 00:17:40.520
Right?
 

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:42.140
No, no, we're not talking about
national.

00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:43.119
It's federal.
 

00:17:43.119 --> 00:17:44.250
It's all federal.
 

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.819
It's not the scary big national
thing.

00:17:45.819 --> 00:17:47.509
It's a federal Constitution.
 

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:49.790
And that's why,
of course, the people who are

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.798
defending the Constitution call
themselves Federalists,

00:17:52.798 --> 00:17:56.064
not nationalists,
and thus the opponents call

00:17:56.064 --> 00:17:58.288
themselves Anti-Federalists.
 

00:17:58.288 --> 00:18:02.718
So federalism is a really
brilliant compromise in this

00:18:02.718 --> 00:18:05.808
battle over where to invest
power,

00:18:05.808 --> 00:18:09.269
but obviously it did not solve
all questions,

00:18:09.269 --> 00:18:13.588
and for some people it didn't
even solve any of the questions.

00:18:13.588 --> 00:18:16.490
The ongoing ratification debate
was actually really fierce.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:20.914
And since by default we end up
sort of all siding with the

00:18:20.914 --> 00:18:23.808
Federalists,
let's look for a moment at the

00:18:23.808 --> 00:18:27.384
Anti-Federalists and the sorts
of things that they were arguing

00:18:27.384 --> 00:18:30.210
in these debates throughout all
of the states.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.080
For one thing,
like everyone else,

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.858
they are concerned with the
placement of power.

00:18:34.858 --> 00:18:38.290
They worry that this new
national executive is going to

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:40.578
be a tyrant and eventually a
king.

00:18:40.578 --> 00:18:44.327
They worry that state rights,
state boundaries,

00:18:44.327 --> 00:18:48.483
state constitutions will be
violated by a tyrannical

00:18:48.483 --> 00:18:50.440
national government.
 

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.644
They fear that the
Constitution's going to foster

00:18:53.644 --> 00:18:57.384
the creation of a standing army,
which everyone of course

00:18:57.384 --> 00:18:59.990
believes to be the tool of
tyranny.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.750
They fear that some kind of
overbearing aristocracy is going

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:06.430
to take over and repress the
common man.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:09.880
They fear a lack of proper
representation.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:13.153
They fear that they're not
going to have the right sort of

00:19:13.153 --> 00:19:15.738
a voice, or any voice,
in this new centralized

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:16.598
government.
 

00:19:16.598 --> 00:19:20.308
When you read about these fears
in their original form--

00:19:20.308 --> 00:19:22.857
and of course throughout this
period and throughout all of

00:19:22.857 --> 00:19:25.049
these debates they're writing
newspaper essays;

00:19:25.049 --> 00:19:26.528
they're writing pamphlets;
they're giving speeches.

00:19:26.528 --> 00:19:29.828
This is a literal debate in
print and in person,

00:19:29.828 --> 00:19:32.906
and when you read some of these
Anti-Federalist essays and

00:19:32.906 --> 00:19:35.866
pamphlets,
you can really see how some of

00:19:35.866 --> 00:19:40.381
them are directly relatable to
the Revolution just fought and

00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:41.660
hopefully won.
 

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.907
I guess in their mind maybe it
hadn't been won yet because it

00:19:43.907 --> 00:19:45.670
depends on what happens with
this government.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:46.910
They're talking about tyranny.
 

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:48.230
They're talking about monarchy.
 

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.259
They're talking about violated
liberties.

00:19:50.259 --> 00:19:52.038
They're talking about
aristocracy.

00:19:52.038 --> 00:19:54.200
They're talking about unjust
representation.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:59.096
You could sort of draw a line
and understand where these fears

00:19:59.096 --> 00:20:00.058
come from.
 

00:20:00.058 --> 00:20:02.118
Just listen to how some
Anti-Federalists actually

00:20:02.118 --> 00:20:03.150
expressed these fears.
 

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:05.523
One writer wrote that the
Constitution was,

00:20:05.523 --> 00:20:08.858
quote, "the most odious
system of tyranny that was ever

00:20:08.858 --> 00:20:09.990
projected."
 

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:12.355
Patrick Henry,
who is always useful for

00:20:12.355 --> 00:20:15.354
wonderful quotes,
in the Virginia Convention says

00:20:15.354 --> 00:20:18.750
that by giving so much power to
a new national government,

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.269
quote, "the tyranny of
Philadelphia--

00:20:21.269 --> 00:20:25.173
the Federal Convention--may be
like the tyranny of George

00:20:25.173 --> 00:20:26.009
III."
 

00:20:26.009 --> 00:20:26.284
Okay.
 

00:20:26.284 --> 00:20:28.750
You can't draw a more direct
link than that.

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:29.190
Right?
 

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:32.714
Okay, Constitution,
George III, tyranny--directly

00:20:32.714 --> 00:20:35.798
harkening right back to the
Revolution.

00:20:35.798 --> 00:20:39.130
And for many people these
arguments really rang true.

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:43.365
Now of course,
in the end the Federalists

00:20:43.365 --> 00:20:47.252
proved successful,
this despite the fact that they

00:20:47.252 --> 00:20:50.578
really were promoting a pretty
radical change of government,

00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:53.430
and there are a good number of
reasons why they're successful.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:55.529
I'm just going to mention a few
here,

00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:58.980
and one of them in a sense is
really obvious but makes a lot

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:01.318
of sense that it acts in their
favor,

00:21:01.318 --> 00:21:03.553
and that is:
the Federalists are really

00:21:03.553 --> 00:21:06.396
national-minded,
so they're actually thinking

00:21:06.396 --> 00:21:09.790
beyond the bounds of their
states and it makes them much

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.554
more likely to be able to create
some kind of united publicity

00:21:13.554 --> 00:21:17.133
campaign to argue on a national
level in a way that perhaps

00:21:17.133 --> 00:21:19.910
Anti-Federalists couldn't or
wouldn't.

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:23.728
Also one reason why the
Federalists prove successful is

00:21:23.728 --> 00:21:27.263
partly because the
Anti-Federalists don't offer any

00:21:27.263 --> 00:21:29.808
alternative to the Constitution.
 

00:21:29.808 --> 00:21:33.859
They critique what's there but
they don't offer an alternative

00:21:33.859 --> 00:21:36.565
suggestion,
so the debate is criticism and

00:21:36.565 --> 00:21:39.108
the Federalists defending and
countering,

00:21:39.108 --> 00:21:42.460
criticism and the Federalists
defending and countering.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.318
That's a very particular kind
of debate.

00:21:44.318 --> 00:21:46.798
If the Anti-Federalists had
come forward with another

00:21:46.798 --> 00:21:49.900
suggestion, it would have been a
very different kind of debate.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.660
In some ways you might argue
that the Federalist victory was

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.048
something of an Anti-Federalist
default.

00:21:58.048 --> 00:22:00.464
As South Carolina
Anti-Federalist Aedanus Burke

00:22:00.464 --> 00:22:03.090
put it after the fact,
"We had no principle of

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:04.509
concert or union."
 

00:22:04.509 --> 00:22:09.184
We were sort of all objecting
on our own and we didn't have

00:22:09.184 --> 00:22:11.038
any unified campaign.
 

00:22:11.038 --> 00:22:13.522
Or, as Madison put it,
I think in a little bit of an

00:22:13.522 --> 00:22:15.179
exaggeration,
the Anti-Federalists,

00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:17.028
quote, "had no plan
whatever.

00:22:17.028 --> 00:22:19.068
They looked no farther than to
put a negative on the

00:22:19.068 --> 00:22:20.548
Constitution and return
home."

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:20.798
Okay.
 

00:22:20.798 --> 00:22:22.750
So maybe that's a little
exaggerated,

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.340
but in fact there was no
obvious concrete alternative

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.655
presented by the
Anti-Federalists and that really

00:22:29.655 --> 00:22:33.038
was a fundamental weakness in
their position.

00:22:33.038 --> 00:22:35.923
This does not mean,
however, that there were no

00:22:35.923 --> 00:22:38.618
good arguments against the
Constitution,

00:22:38.618 --> 00:22:42.400
and the best proof of that is
the Federalist essays,

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.368
which you're going to be
reading this week,

00:22:44.368 --> 00:22:47.748
because those essays aren't
just explaining the

00:22:47.748 --> 00:22:50.636
Constitution;
they're defending the

00:22:50.636 --> 00:22:51.828
Constitution.
 

00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:55.352
And they're defending it
against this sea of fears and

00:22:55.352 --> 00:22:59.273
accusations and all these sort
of wild ideas floating around

00:22:59.273 --> 00:23:02.597
about what might happen or
what's implied or what's

00:23:02.597 --> 00:23:06.519
suggested or what's allowable in
this new government.

00:23:06.519 --> 00:23:10.890
The Federalist essays
were Hamilton's idea,

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:13.578
and Hamilton invited his
nationalist buddy,

00:23:13.578 --> 00:23:16.285
James Madison,
to join him in the effort and

00:23:16.285 --> 00:23:18.990
they also invited John Jay to
take part--

00:23:18.990 --> 00:23:20.390
and John Jay ended up getting
sick,

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.808
so he wrote a few essays and
then he dropped out so,

00:23:22.808 --> 00:23:25.472
as I'm sure you well know,
most of them are written by

00:23:25.472 --> 00:23:26.630
Madison and Hamilton.
 

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:31.526
The Federalist was not
the only printed defense of the

00:23:31.526 --> 00:23:32.750
Constitution.
 

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:33.858
There were lots of them.
 

00:23:33.858 --> 00:23:37.680
There was obviously--As I said,
it's a big print debate,

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.977
but the Federalist was
something that was written with

00:23:40.977 --> 00:23:44.440
really big ambitions because its
authors really essentially were

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.681
creating a broad,
comprehensive,

00:23:46.681 --> 00:23:49.848
step-by-step defense of the
Constitution,

00:23:49.848 --> 00:23:54.551
and they really hoped that by
swaying the state of New York in

00:23:54.551 --> 00:23:58.636
favor of ratification,
maybe they would bring other

00:23:58.636 --> 00:24:01.720
states like Virginia along in
its wake.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.818
The essays were all signed
"Publius."

00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:08.051
The authors all wrote under the
same pseudonym because they

00:24:08.051 --> 00:24:11.006
actually wanted the essays not
to seem like the crafty

00:24:11.006 --> 00:24:14.405
arguments of two really leading
nationalists who were going to

00:24:14.405 --> 00:24:17.750
say anything to get us to sign
on to the Constitution.

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.173
They wanted to suggest that
these were just even-handed,

00:24:21.173 --> 00:24:24.845
rational ideas that were sort
of generally out in the public

00:24:24.845 --> 00:24:25.528
sphere.
 

00:24:25.528 --> 00:24:28.269
Now of course among insiders,
people figured out who the

00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:30.462
authors were,
even though supposedly no one's

00:24:30.462 --> 00:24:31.509
supposed to know.
 

00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:32.390
It's Publius.
 

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.200
Who can that be?
 

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:37.056
People figured it out pretty
quickly and sometimes the

00:24:37.056 --> 00:24:39.240
authors helped people along.
 

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.400
And there's an anecdote about
Hamilton--

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.865
I went digging to see if I
could find ultimate verification

00:24:43.865 --> 00:24:45.650
and I can't find ultimate
verification,

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.987
but I'm going to offer it
anyway because there is a

00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:51.218
supposed witness to the story,
but people aren't sure whether

00:24:51.218 --> 00:24:52.568
to believe the witness.
 

00:24:52.568 --> 00:24:55.967
At any rate,
Hamilton--supposedly the day

00:24:55.967 --> 00:24:59.450
before his fatal duel with Aaron
Burr--

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:02.869
paid a call on a friend,
a good eighteenth-century name,

00:25:02.869 --> 00:25:04.269
Egbert Benson.
 

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:06.778
He went to visit Egbert Benson,
who was a lawyer,

00:25:06.778 --> 00:25:10.730
and supposedly one of Benson's
law clerks answered the door,

00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:13.396
said that he would go find
Benson, walked off to find

00:25:13.396 --> 00:25:15.144
Benson,
and as he came back,

00:25:15.144 --> 00:25:18.599
he said he saw Hamilton in
Benson's library put something

00:25:18.599 --> 00:25:21.440
in a book and put the book up on
the shelf.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.772
And the clerk said,
'Mr. Benson's not here,' and

00:25:23.772 --> 00:25:25.808
Hamilton said,
'Thank you,' and left.

00:25:25.808 --> 00:25:28.130
So of course the guy is like:
I wonder what that was?

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.309
Right?
 

00:25:28.309 --> 00:25:30.029
So he goes over to the shelf
and he pulls down the book.

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.880
He wants to see what it is.
 

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.814
And supposedly what it was is a
piece of paper in Hamilton's

00:25:34.814 --> 00:25:37.648
handwriting in which he'd
written all of the Federalist

00:25:37.648 --> 00:25:39.440
essays that were his.
 

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.538
So supposedly,
the night before the duel when

00:25:41.538 --> 00:25:44.448
he's like: 'got my checklist of
things I'd better do in case I

00:25:44.448 --> 00:25:45.880
die tomorrow:
number one,

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:48.460
get credit for Federalist
essays.

00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.579
[laughter/laughs]
Now it's unclear whether that

00:25:51.579 --> 00:25:53.890
actually happened or didn't
happen.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.634
The guy--The fellow who saw it
in later years said he did see

00:25:58.634 --> 00:26:00.337
it,
and said he saw the piece of

00:26:00.337 --> 00:26:02.003
paper,
and said the piece of paper at

00:26:02.003 --> 00:26:04.368
some point was given to the New
York Public Library,

00:26:04.368 --> 00:26:06.818
but then nobody quite knows
where it is in the New York

00:26:06.818 --> 00:26:07.588
Public Library.
 

00:26:07.588 --> 00:26:09.380
So it's unclear whether it
really happened.

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:12.410
People--Some people at the time
insisted it really did.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.575
Whether or not it really did,
the fact is that actually the

00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:18.576
people who wrote it did care
about it and did care about

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:22.518
which ones they wrote,
and we don't entirely know who

00:26:22.518 --> 00:26:24.740
wrote which in some cases.
 

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.375
We know some are Hamilton
essays and some are Madison

00:26:26.375 --> 00:26:28.051
essays,
and then there are some where

00:26:28.051 --> 00:26:29.788
it's blurrier and historians
argue--

00:26:29.788 --> 00:26:32.358
give one guy credit or the
other guy credit over who--

00:26:32.358 --> 00:26:33.858
And I think that's
partly--well,

00:26:33.858 --> 00:26:35.598
partly because they were
rushing,

00:26:35.598 --> 00:26:39.309
but also partly because in some
cases they probably were working

00:26:39.309 --> 00:26:41.490
together on some or sharing
things.

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:43.790
The humbling thing to remember
when you read the

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.480
Federalist this week--
and this actually should really

00:26:47.480 --> 00:26:52.325
mean something to any student--
is that many of them are first

00:26:52.325 --> 00:26:53.019
drafts.
 

00:26:53.019 --> 00:26:55.150
Okay. Those are rough drafts.
 

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.200
That just makes me want to cry
as a writer.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.496
It's like oh,
[laughs]

00:26:58.496 --> 00:27:01.150
why can't my rough drafts look
like that?

00:27:01.150 --> 00:27:05.048
These guys were writing for
newspapers,

00:27:05.048 --> 00:27:07.563
so they were in a hurry,
sometimes literally dashing

00:27:07.563 --> 00:27:10.519
something off and getting it to
the newspaper immediately.

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:13.118
So they're writing these in a
hurry.

00:27:13.118 --> 00:27:14.440
They don't have time for a lot
of revision.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:19.028
That to me is an amazingly
humbling thought.

00:27:19.028 --> 00:27:22.847
All told, there were
eighty-five Federalist

00:27:22.847 --> 00:27:26.435
essays.
As I said, they're published in

00:27:26.435 --> 00:27:27.660
New York newspapers.
 

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.214
The thought is they're going to
sway the New York ratification

00:27:32.214 --> 00:27:36.920
debate, and they appear between
October 1787 and May of 1788.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:39.261
And then later,
in June of 1788,

00:27:39.261 --> 00:27:41.680
they get put out in book form.
 

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.858
And then obviously they migrate
wherever they migrate to.

00:27:45.858 --> 00:27:47.480
Lots of other people read the
Federalist.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:52.460
Now, as suggested by its title,
the Federalist --

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:55.500
while it did demonstrate a lot
of things about the new

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.838
Constitution--
it did have one overriding

00:27:57.838 --> 00:27:59.580
argument,
and that was:

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.038
the benefits of federalism.
 

00:28:02.038 --> 00:28:02.277
Right?
 

00:28:02.277 --> 00:28:04.568
Not nationalism--and they're
sure to stress that throughout

00:28:04.568 --> 00:28:06.594
all of the essays;
we're not talking about

00:28:06.594 --> 00:28:07.269
nationalism.
 

00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:10.525
Federal--federal--states are
still important--the subtext of

00:28:10.525 --> 00:28:13.778
the calming component of the
Federalist essays.

00:28:13.778 --> 00:28:16.953
A federal government would
energize the government without

00:28:16.953 --> 00:28:19.557
prostrating the states or
trampling on the American

00:28:19.557 --> 00:28:21.242
people;
that's the compromise of

00:28:21.242 --> 00:28:21.798
federalism.
 

00:28:21.798 --> 00:28:24.858
And, as I mentioned at some
point earlier,

00:28:24.858 --> 00:28:27.589
in an earlier lecture,
to demonstrate just how badly

00:28:27.589 --> 00:28:29.838
this government needed to be
energized,

00:28:29.838 --> 00:28:33.375
the Federalist essays
show again and again the

00:28:33.375 --> 00:28:37.090
disaster that would reign if the
Articles of Confederation were

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:38.529
allowed to continue.
 

00:28:38.529 --> 00:28:40.953
And at some point,
I did talk about the sort of ax

00:28:40.953 --> 00:28:43.575
job that the Federalist
essays do on the

00:28:43.575 --> 00:28:45.058
Articles of Confederation.
 

00:28:45.058 --> 00:28:47.202
They really want to,
because they have to prove that

00:28:47.202 --> 00:28:49.806
the Articles are so bad that of
course this new Constitution is

00:28:49.806 --> 00:28:50.730
the perfect thing.
 

00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:51.410
It makes sense.
 

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:53.410
You have to move in this
direction.

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:58.922
So in New York and elsewhere,
the ratification debates wore

00:28:58.922 --> 00:29:03.009
on, states proceeding at
different paces.

00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:07.179
But there is one thing that
emerged from these debates on

00:29:07.179 --> 00:29:09.858
the part of the
Anti-Federalists,

00:29:09.858 --> 00:29:13.430
and this actually is a specific
suggestion on their part,

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.430
a specific idea about something
that has to be there.

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:19.491
Basically, throughout the
states one thing that

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:23.086
Anti-Federalists consistently
demanded was some kind of

00:29:23.086 --> 00:29:27.830
guarantee of personal liberties,
some kind of a declaration of

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:32.630
rights like those that existed
in many state constitutions--

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:36.178
something that would protect
personal liberties in the same

00:29:36.178 --> 00:29:39.541
document that seemed to be
investing this new government

00:29:39.541 --> 00:29:40.950
with so much power.
 

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:44.555
So in essence,
the Anti-Federalists want a

00:29:44.555 --> 00:29:46.048
bill of rights.
 

00:29:46.048 --> 00:29:48.894
Now from our vantage point,
a bill of rights just seems

00:29:48.894 --> 00:29:50.788
like an unquestionably good
thing.

00:29:50.788 --> 00:29:50.929
Right?
 

00:29:50.929 --> 00:29:51.579
We love our Bill of Rights.
 

00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:53.358
The Bill of Rights is good.
 

00:29:53.358 --> 00:29:56.750
Why would the Federalists not
want a bill of rights?

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.423
But the problem is,
some Federalists did have

00:29:59.423 --> 00:30:02.220
problems with this idea of a
bill of rights.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:07.122
For one thing,
they claimed that the entire

00:30:07.122 --> 00:30:10.987
Constitution,
by providing a well-framed

00:30:10.987 --> 00:30:15.290
government that had checks and
balances and government by

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.874
election,
in a sense you could argue that

00:30:17.874 --> 00:30:20.941
that document was so framed and
the government was so checked

00:30:20.941 --> 00:30:23.905
and balanced that it was in and
of itself a sort of bill of

00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:25.798
rights;
it was a controlled government.

00:30:25.798 --> 00:30:28.601
They also said,
the federal government has

00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:31.130
enumerated powers in this
document.

00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:33.830
So in other words,
a power that is not given to

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.650
the government is not owned by
the government.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.428
Why do we need a bill of rights
saying well, we need to protect

00:30:39.428 --> 00:30:40.368
power of the press?
 

00:30:40.368 --> 00:30:42.726
We haven't given power of the
press to the national

00:30:42.726 --> 00:30:45.599
government, so why do we need
suddenly to mention it in a bill

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:46.259
of rights?
 

00:30:46.259 --> 00:30:50.426
Some Federalists even argued
that if we start to write things

00:30:50.426 --> 00:30:54.108
down--put rights into
writing--we might actually imply

00:30:54.108 --> 00:30:57.303
something bad;
we might actually imply--If we

00:30:57.303 --> 00:30:59.700
try to define the freedom of
press,

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.730
freedom of religion and put it
into words,

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:04.845
maybe the implication will be
that in some way or another the

00:31:04.845 --> 00:31:07.907
national government actually
does have some power over those

00:31:07.907 --> 00:31:08.480
things.
 

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:10.210
Maybe once we get into the sea
of rights,

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.558
we might lead people to be able
to conclude things about that

00:31:13.558 --> 00:31:17.298
government down the road that we
might not want them to conclude.

00:31:17.298 --> 00:31:21.778
But the Anti-Federalists had a
pretty powerful argument in

00:31:21.778 --> 00:31:23.980
favor of a bill of rights.
 

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.647
It was a multileveled argument,
but one part of it was

00:31:26.647 --> 00:31:29.355
particularly hard to argue with,
and that is:

00:31:29.355 --> 00:31:32.474
any republican government,
any small "r"

00:31:32.474 --> 00:31:35.430
republican government,
ought to do everything that it

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:39.029
could do to keep its citizens
aware of their rights,

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:43.144
including something like
listing them as amendments to

00:31:43.144 --> 00:31:44.618
the Constitution.
 

00:31:44.618 --> 00:31:46.132
In other words,
the Anti-Federalists say,

00:31:46.132 --> 00:31:48.022
'Well, in a republic,
the people need to know their

00:31:48.022 --> 00:31:48.440
rights.
 

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.750
They need to have them in
writing.

00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:54.400
So of course we should have a
bill of rights so that the

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.519
American public knows what their
rights are.'

00:31:57.519 --> 00:32:00.926
In the end, it was only with
the promise that a list of

00:32:00.926 --> 00:32:04.522
rights would be amended and
added to the Constitution that

00:32:04.522 --> 00:32:06.480
it was ultimately ratified.
 

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.950
And so one by one,
the states debated,

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.690
and then over time decided to
ratify the Constitution.

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.595
I think again,
as with so many things about

00:32:15.595 --> 00:32:18.568
this period and the Constitution
debate,

00:32:18.568 --> 00:32:22.673
we don't tend to think of it as
a real fight or debate or

00:32:22.673 --> 00:32:23.700
controversy.
 

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.250
We sort of see things churning
along and we imagine:

00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:28.700
ratification of the
Constitution equals a bunch of

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:31.348
guys in a room signing pieces of
paper like: ah,

00:32:31.348 --> 00:32:33.446
it's ratified,
the end, now let's have a

00:32:33.446 --> 00:32:34.200
government.'
 

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.086
But in fact,
people were really anxiously

00:32:37.086 --> 00:32:39.180
watching this--and curious.
 

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.180
And are states going to ratify?
 

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.140
How many will ratify?
 

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:43.059
Is this going to happen?
 

00:32:43.059 --> 00:32:43.700
Won't it happen?
 

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.538
What happens if only half of
them ratify?

00:32:45.538 --> 00:32:48.507
This is something that people
all over the United States were

00:32:48.507 --> 00:32:50.980
watching and wondering what was
going to happen.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:55.028
Here Ezra Stiles helps us out
one more time because he put in

00:32:55.028 --> 00:32:58.942
his diary every time he heard
that a state had ratified the

00:32:58.942 --> 00:33:00.088
Constitution.
 

00:33:00.088 --> 00:33:02.068
So in the midst of everything
else in his diary,

00:33:02.068 --> 00:33:06.630
you'll see--like,
on January 9,1788,

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.496
he writes that a courier raced
from Hartford to New Haven and

00:33:10.496 --> 00:33:14.038
made the entire trip in a mere
hour and six minutes,

00:33:14.038 --> 00:33:16.430
which--Actually,
since it takes--what?--

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:17.759
like 45 minutes by car to go to
Hartford,

00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:21.048
an hour and six minutes is
pretty good for a horse I think,

00:33:21.048 --> 00:33:23.138
[laughter]
so that guy really raced to

00:33:23.138 --> 00:33:26.189
announce to New Haven that
Connecticut had ratified the

00:33:26.189 --> 00:33:27.150
Constitution.
 

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:27.407
Right?
 

00:33:27.407 --> 00:33:29.731
He puts that down and he
clearly was impressed with the

00:33:29.731 --> 00:33:30.680
speed of the rider.
 

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.998
On February 11,
New Haven gets the news that

00:33:34.998 --> 00:33:37.509
Massachusetts ratified.
 

00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:40.123
Stiles puts this in his diary
and he adds: Bells were rung

00:33:40.123 --> 00:33:42.461
throughout the city and cannon
were discharged"

00:33:42.461 --> 00:33:44.598
So now clearly,
Connecticut has signed on;

00:33:44.598 --> 00:33:47.449
they're watching to see who
else is signing on and when

00:33:47.449 --> 00:33:50.140
someone else does sign on,
there's a celebration.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.154
At the end of June,
Stiles noted that at about 1:30

00:33:53.154 --> 00:33:55.696
in the afternoon--
and I love when they note the

00:33:55.696 --> 00:33:57.481
precise time,
because then you know it's

00:33:57.481 --> 00:33:59.288
something they believed to be
significant.

00:33:59.288 --> 00:34:02.727
At 1:30 this afternoon,
New Haven received the news

00:34:02.727 --> 00:34:05.820
that New Hampshire had
ratified--and that--New

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.090
Hampshire is the ninth state.
 

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:13.246
So what that means is that now
the Constitution could go into

00:34:13.246 --> 00:34:14.018
effect.
 

00:34:14.018 --> 00:34:16.137
And as Stiles described it,
"As soon as the News

00:34:16.137 --> 00:34:18.460
arrived the four Bells in the
City were set a Ringing,

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.400
&amp; the foederal Flag
displayed and foederal

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.230
Discharges of Canon."
 

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:26.518
What is actually a federal
discharge of cannon?

00:34:26.518 --> 00:34:28.260
I don't know what a federal--I
never -- I typed that out

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:30.349
without stopping to think what a
federal discharge of cannon is.

00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:32.539
But there was a federal
discharge of cannon "--

00:34:32.539 --> 00:34:34.050
&amp; Rejoycing"--
[laughs]

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:35.789
general rejoicing in New
Haven--

00:34:35.789 --> 00:34:37.469
like: 'yay, the Constitution
has kicked in;

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:39.260
thank you, New Hampshire.'
 

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.559
Meanwhile, throughout this
period, Stiles still had Yale

00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:45.500
College seniors debating
constitutional issues.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.851
[laughs]
If you were not interested in

00:34:46.851 --> 00:34:48.860
politics at this point at Yale
College, you were in deep

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:49.300
trouble.
 

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.612
He had them debate:
"Whether it had been

00:34:51.612 --> 00:34:54.451
better to refer the new
Constitution to the Ratificn by

00:34:54.451 --> 00:34:57.603
Town Meetings or a Plurality of
the personal Votes of all the

00:34:57.603 --> 00:34:59.760
Freemen of the United
States?"

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.110
Now that's kind of interesting,
actually.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:03.449
That's kind of a radical thing
for him to ask the students to

00:35:03.449 --> 00:35:03.800
debate.
 

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:07.115
Or whether the President of
Congress--the President of

00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:09.369
Congress?--"the President
...

00:35:09.369 --> 00:35:12.588
ought to be visited with an
independt Power of Commandg the

00:35:12.588 --> 00:35:13.809
American Army?"
 

00:35:13.809 --> 00:35:17.400
If you're curious about what
other things Stiles has people

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:20.869
debating in addition to random
constitutional issues,

00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:24.010
I just have a little sampling
here to give you a sense of what

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:27.150
it would have been like to be a
senior at Yale College in 1788

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.820
and 1789.
 

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:30.014
They debated:
"Whether the Breakg up of

00:35:30.014 --> 00:35:33.130
the Roman Empire by the Goths
&amp; Vandals was prejudicial to

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:35.018
the Progress of
Literature?"

00:35:35.018 --> 00:35:36.724
[laughter]
Can you imagine doing that one

00:35:36.724 --> 00:35:38.516
day and then the next day:
and now [laughs]

00:35:38.516 --> 00:35:40.010
let's talk about the President.
 

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:42.384
They debated:
"Whether the Scriptures

00:35:42.384 --> 00:35:44.179
are divinely inspired?";
 

00:35:44.179 --> 00:35:46.768
"Whether good Policy is
ever inconsistent with

00:35:46.768 --> 00:35:47.650
Justice?";
 

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.699
and "Whether all mankd
descended from Adam?"

00:35:50.699 --> 00:35:50.963
Okay.
 

00:35:50.963 --> 00:35:53.929
That's a wide-ranging bunch of
things they're debating.

00:35:53.929 --> 00:35:57.010
I love the fact that Stiles
always puts that in his diary,

00:35:57.010 --> 00:36:00.965
so it's actually fascinating
just to read through and see

00:36:00.965 --> 00:36:04.639
what students were set to
discuss at a given time.

00:36:04.639 --> 00:36:05.150
Okay.
 

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:10.980
So we've seen a national debate
over a new Constitution.

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:14.884
We've seen a debate taking
place between people who by no

00:36:14.884 --> 00:36:19.068
means had an absolute consensus
about what kind of government

00:36:19.068 --> 00:36:21.090
should be put into place.
 

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:25.717
Given that this was a national
debate, what does it show us

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:29.230
about the state of the nation at
the time?

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:32.675
What does it really suggest
about the new nation and its

00:36:32.675 --> 00:36:33.489
principles?
 

00:36:33.489 --> 00:36:36.840
Well, certainly for one thing,
underneath all of the

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.864
disagreement and the wrangling
and the arguing,

00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.768
there was some consensus.
 

00:36:41.768 --> 00:36:43.880
So certainly,
both Federalists and

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:47.016
Anti-Federalists agreed that a
small "r"

00:36:47.016 --> 00:36:50.599
republican government was the
general aim and goal--

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:53.489
a government based on popular
sovereignty,

00:36:53.489 --> 00:36:57.771
on the will of the people--a
government that placed the

00:36:57.771 --> 00:37:01.260
ultimate power in the hands of
the people.

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:04.079
So that's a general consensus.
 

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:06.583
I'm going to talk in a moment
about what that means,

00:37:06.583 --> 00:37:09.530
but certainly in a general way
people could agree on that.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:12.465
Americans also could generally
agree that this was an

00:37:12.465 --> 00:37:16.349
experiment in government;
that it was something unique;

00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:20.637
that they were experimenting in
the possibility of having people

00:37:20.637 --> 00:37:24.788
sit down and deliberately create
a just government grounded on

00:37:24.788 --> 00:37:27.510
the rights and will of the
populace.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:30.219
And to communicate this,
to get this across,

00:37:30.219 --> 00:37:32.110
I'm going to read something.
 

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:33.469
I don't think I've read this
before.

00:37:33.469 --> 00:37:35.838
Have I--I don't think I've read
the first paragraph or the first

00:37:35.838 --> 00:37:38.018
couple sentences from the first
Federalist essay.

00:37:38.018 --> 00:37:40.057
I went digging back into other
lectures and I don't think I've

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:41.554
done it yet,
and if I have you're going to

00:37:41.554 --> 00:37:44.110
have to listen to it twice,
but I don't think I have.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:48.246
And I tend to read these couple
sentences in a lot of my classes

00:37:48.246 --> 00:37:51.530
because I think they really
capture this idea about

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:55.471
experimentation that's looming
over what they're doing at the

00:37:55.471 --> 00:37:57.692
time,
this sense that they really are

00:37:57.692 --> 00:38:00.436
deciding something major,
not just in the Constitution

00:38:00.436 --> 00:38:03.695
that they're creating but also
in the process by which they're

00:38:03.695 --> 00:38:05.563
creating it--
that the fact that they're

00:38:05.563 --> 00:38:07.565
deliberating,
debating, and then creating,

00:38:07.565 --> 00:38:10.349
and then stepping back to allow
it to go into effect,

00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:12.949
that also is something that
they see as major.

00:38:12.949 --> 00:38:17.085
So this is from within the
first paragraph of Federalist

00:38:17.085 --> 00:38:17.585
No.
 

00:38:17.585 --> 00:38:20.751
1 by Hamilton:
"It has been frequently

00:38:20.751 --> 00:38:22.945
remarked,
that it seems to have been

00:38:22.945 --> 00:38:25.239
reserved to the people of this
country,

00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:28.545
by their conduct and example,
to decide the important

00:38:28.545 --> 00:38:31.076
question,
whether societies of men are

00:38:31.076 --> 00:38:34.346
really capable or not,
of establishing good government

00:38:34.346 --> 00:38:37.641
from reflection and choice,
or whether they are forever

00:38:37.641 --> 00:38:41.010
destined to depend for their
political constitutions,

00:38:41.010 --> 00:38:44.070
on accident and force....
 

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:47.246
The crisis, at which we are
arrived, may with propriety be

00:38:47.246 --> 00:38:50.590
regarded as the aera in which
that decision is to be made;

00:38:50.590 --> 00:38:54.255
and a wrong election of the
part we shall act,

00:38:54.255 --> 00:38:55.070
may, ...
 

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:58.686
deserve to be considered as the
general misfortune of

00:38:58.686 --> 00:38:59.800
mankind."
 

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.070
Okay. "Boom."
 

00:39:01.070 --> 00:39:02.320
That's a big statement.
 

00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:05.010
He is literally saying:
the United States is deciding

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:08.061
for all time if you can sit and
deliberate and create a just

00:39:08.061 --> 00:39:11.081
government--
or not, and if we do something

00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:14.561
stupid,
the answer would appear to be

00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:16.409
not--for all time.
 

00:39:16.409 --> 00:39:18.713
So this experiment is not just
an experiment,

00:39:18.713 --> 00:39:21.487
but it's one that to people at
the time actually means

00:39:21.487 --> 00:39:22.219
something.
 

00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:24.320
They feel that they're proving
something in this experiment

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:25.300
that they're undertaking.
 

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.130
It has real consequences.
 

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:29.972
Now that said,
of course even with the

00:39:29.972 --> 00:39:32.739
ratification of the
Constitution,

00:39:32.739 --> 00:39:37.851
all kinds of questions are
still looming about exactly how

00:39:37.851 --> 00:39:41.530
this experiment was going to
play out,

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:44.530
or indeed if it would survive
at all.

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.577
And wrapped up in this question
about what's going to happen

00:39:47.577 --> 00:39:50.523
with the government is a deeper
question about whether the

00:39:50.523 --> 00:39:53.829
promise of the Revolution is
actually going to be fulfilled.

00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:56.699
The Revolution has all of this
promise attached to it.

00:39:56.699 --> 00:39:59.945
There's all of this debate
about how to bring that kind of

00:39:59.945 --> 00:40:00.969
promise to life.
 

00:40:00.969 --> 00:40:01.960
Here is one try.
 

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.860
It's a constitution.
 

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.199
We're going to put it into
effect.

00:40:04.199 --> 00:40:07.192
And people now have to step
back and see if it's going to

00:40:07.192 --> 00:40:08.963
work--
and many, many people are

00:40:08.963 --> 00:40:12.137
absolutely not convinced that
it's going to fulfill all that

00:40:12.137 --> 00:40:14.719
promise that was unleashed by
the Revolution.

00:40:14.719 --> 00:40:17.318
It's one thing to assign power
in a document,

00:40:17.318 --> 00:40:20.507
and it's another thing to
really bring that document to

00:40:20.507 --> 00:40:21.039
life.
 

00:40:21.039 --> 00:40:22.949
If you think about our
Constitution,

00:40:22.949 --> 00:40:25.880
it's a pretty short document;
it's pretty brief.

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.159
It's a framework.
 

00:40:27.159 --> 00:40:29.110
It doesn't go into lots of
detail.

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:33.112
So there's a lot of things that
had to be fleshed out and worked

00:40:33.112 --> 00:40:35.909
out once that government went
into effect.

00:40:35.909 --> 00:40:40.061
And in Thursday's lecture,
I'm going to touch on some of

00:40:40.061 --> 00:40:40.590
that.
 

00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:44.452
I'm going to talk a little bit
about how this begins to play

00:40:44.452 --> 00:40:48.512
out in the 1790s and what that
suggests about the legacy of the

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:50.019
Revolution overall.
 

00:40:50.019 --> 00:40:51.018
I will stop there.
 

00:40:51.018 --> 00:40:54.900
I will see you on Thursday,
our last class.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:01.000

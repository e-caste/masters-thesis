00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.615
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Today,

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:06.010
of course I'm going to talk
about The Known World,

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.900
the second-to-last of our
novels.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.777
In the two lectures that I have
planned, I'm going to take up

00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:18.480
fairly abstract questions,
because I think this novel,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.690
for all its wealth of detail,
calls for an address to these

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.038
couple of questions.
And I'll tell you about those

00:00:26.038 --> 00:00:29.280
in a minute, but before I pursue
that line of argument,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.370
which today will take a
somewhat narrow scope and on

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.220
Wednesday will take in the whole
of the novel,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.180
I just want to hear from you,
a little bit,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.070
about what reading this novel
was like,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.970
just in a simple way.
How did you respond to it?

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.680
How did it make you feel as a
reader?

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.110
What was the experience like?
What did you notice?

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.830
So, who can tell me what they
noticed?

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.758
Yes.Student:
I guess it found it a

00:00:55.758 --> 00:00:57.907
little disorienting,
because of all the names that

00:00:57.907 --> 00:00:59.880
were introduced quickly at the
beginning,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.234
and jumping around in a
different time,

00:01:02.234 --> 00:01:05.579
and also referencing the dead
people as being alive.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.173
So, that was really confusing
and disorienting,

00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:10.880
but I also really liked it,
mostly because of the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.079
descriptive language that was
used,

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.449
particularly when referring
to--I felt like he captured the

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:18.552
environment really well,
so I enjoyed

00:01:18.552 --> 00:01:20.920
it.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Uh huh.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.548
So, was the natural description
a kind of grounding,

00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:27.110
in that context of
disorientation?

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.820
That's a very,
I think, perceptive take on

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.510
what he's doing in the novel.
Yeah.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.700
What else?
What else did you notice?

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.245
Yes.Student:
Well, the lack of a strong

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:43.019
sense of plot made it difficult
for me to come back to the book,

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.540
once I'd put it down,
so that I thought that it was

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.909
beautifully written,
which meant that when I was

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.983
sitting there reading it I had
no trouble staying engaged with

00:01:50.983 --> 00:01:53.276
the book,
but when I put it down I sort

00:01:53.276 --> 00:01:56.454
of forgot about it and had no
interest in picking it up again

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:58.680
until I did because I had to for
class.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.311
Professor Amy
Hungerford: It's terrible,

00:01:59.311 --> 00:01:59.476
isn't it?
Yes.

00:01:59.476 --> 00:02:02.655
Yeah.
It has an interesting effect

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:06.450
that way.
It's like, as I was saying,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.849
I think, to a friend in office
hours, that it's totally

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.593
committed to plot,
but on the tiniest scale,

00:02:16.593 --> 00:02:21.456
in the local sense,
that there are so many tiny

00:02:21.456 --> 00:02:27.060
narratives within this novel
that there isn't one,

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.435
or it's hard to detect the one
that will hold you for the whole

00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:33.861
novel.
And I'll definitely- I'll talk

00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:36.740
about that in my second lecture.
Yeah, absolutely,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.889
so that's something we have to
account for.

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.078
Yes,
Mary.Student:

00:02:40.078 --> 00:02:42.302
One of the things that I
thought was really interesting

00:02:42.302 --> 00:02:44.564
was how suddenly the narrative
would jump into the future or

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.461
the past,
saying a lot of things about

00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:48.633
one character--Professor
Amy Hungerford:

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:50.937
Yeah,
absolutely: totally fluid

00:02:50.937 --> 00:02:53.300
chronological sense in the
novel.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.060
So, we have to make sense of
that.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.129
We have to know what to say
about that.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:03.191
One thing I think we can say
is--to put it in context--is

00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:10.009
that he's doing something quite
different from Toni Morrison,

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:14.391
just to take a point of context
that is totally apparent,

00:03:14.391 --> 00:03:19.319
I think, that he's writing in
the same vein as Toni Morrison;

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.530
he's writing an historical
novel about slavery.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.806
And, after Beloved
in the mid '80s,

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:30.593
you cannot do that without
being in the realm of Toni

00:03:30.593 --> 00:03:33.447
Morrison.
But what's interesting about

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:37.261
the contrast in time travel
between Morrison and Jones is

00:03:37.261 --> 00:03:39.849
that with Jones it works
proleptically,

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.327
into the future.
With Toni Morrison,

00:03:42.327 --> 00:03:45.193
Beloved develops the
concept of what she calls

00:03:45.193 --> 00:03:47.424
re-memory.
Any of you who have read the

00:03:47.424 --> 00:03:50.722
novel or thought about it in a
classroom probably have thought

00:03:50.722 --> 00:03:54.031
about this.
Re-memory is that way for the

00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:59.222
characters that the memories of
slavery exist independent of

00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:02.853
persons,
so that the daughter of a slave

00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:07.750
who is living in freedom,
if she goes back to the South,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.693
is imagined to be capable of
walking into a memory of slavery

00:04:13.693 --> 00:04:18.139
even though slavery is,
in that moment, gone.

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.282
So, it's as if there is a free
contact between the present and

00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:26.559
the past, but there is not this
free contact between the present

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.810
and the future,
the way that you see in Jones.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.562
So, we want to ask ourselves:
in what sense is he innovating

00:04:33.562 --> 00:04:35.980
on the aims of the historical
novel,

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:41.180
as Toni Morrison wrote it
twenty years or so earlier?

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.455
What else did you notice?
What other feelings did you

00:04:45.455 --> 00:04:48.379
have about the reading
experience?

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:51.264
Is it like anything else we
have read this term,

00:04:51.264 --> 00:04:52.430
and, if so, what?

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.610
Is it like anything else?

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.442
Yes.Student:
Well, this is kind of an

00:05:07.442 --> 00:05:11.019
unfair comparison to make,
because of the morality issues,

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:13.230
but it reminded me of Blood
Meridian, in the

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.285
sense of its quality of lots of
different thoughts and

00:05:15.285 --> 00:05:17.340
events.Professor Amy
Hungerford: Yeah.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.686
That's an interesting parallel.
So, it has a detailed attention

00:05:22.686 --> 00:05:27.185
to the particular,
which ends up leeching

00:05:27.185 --> 00:05:31.459
significance out of the
particular.

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:32.868
Yes.
Both novels do that,

00:05:32.868 --> 00:05:36.329
and it does call into question,
I think, for both novels,

00:05:36.329 --> 00:05:41.226
how we're to read its morality,
because both deliberately take

00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:45.000
up subjects that evoke in us
moral responses.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.859
So, Jones' choice--if you think
about Nabokov setting himself up

00:05:50.859 --> 00:05:56.533
with a problem (how can you make
us love a pedophile?)--Jones'

00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:59.035
problem,
his chess problem,

00:05:59.035 --> 00:06:02.500
is: what do you do with a black
slave owner?

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:08.093
How are we to understand the
phenomenon of black slave

00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:11.480
ownership?
So, that's the moral question

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.696
he brings up,
and we will have to see whether

00:06:14.696 --> 00:06:18.060
ambivalence finally gives away
to critique,

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.317
whether there is a strong moral
critique of the situations that

00:06:22.317 --> 00:06:25.810
he sets up.
Let me begin, then.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.181
I have some sense of how you're
receiving the book,

00:06:28.181 --> 00:06:32.011
so that's helpful.
I thank you for that.Let me

00:06:32.011 --> 00:06:37.402
begin, then, with my abstract
question, and it really comes

00:06:37.402 --> 00:06:42.050
from the title of the book,
The Known World.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.643
It raises in that title
immediately the question of

00:06:44.643 --> 00:06:49.310
knowledge.
How do you know anything?

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.447
That is a central question for
this book: How do you know

00:06:53.447 --> 00:06:56.206
anything?
The abstract question I'm going

00:06:56.206 --> 00:06:59.094
to ask on Wednesday is how does
anything exist,

00:06:59.094 --> 00:07:02.359
another extremely abstract
question, how can anything

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:03.964
exist?
So, those are my two,

00:07:03.964 --> 00:07:07.843
sort of, governing questions.
They will become much fuller

00:07:07.843 --> 00:07:11.980
and more detailed and concrete
as I lecture.

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:15.077
How do you know anything?
A related question is,

00:07:15.077 --> 00:07:19.139
who is the knower?
The Known World:

00:07:19.139 --> 00:07:24.261
known by whom?
So, the question of the subject

00:07:24.261 --> 00:07:29.124
of knowing, the person who
knows, is immediately also at

00:07:29.124 --> 00:07:32.660
issue.
Who is that person?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:40.129
Is that person accessible to us?
Can we know that person?

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:43.928
History poses,
in the contemporary period,

00:07:43.928 --> 00:07:48.486
all of those problems of
knowledge, and I think this is

00:07:48.486 --> 00:07:52.370
one reason why this is a
historical novel.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:56.921
And it's one reason why fiction
turns to the historical in this

00:07:56.921 --> 00:08:00.959
period, because the practice of
history at this time,

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:03.283
in the second half of the
twentieth century,

00:08:03.283 --> 00:08:06.423
begins to change.
So, it used to be that

00:08:06.423 --> 00:08:10.939
historians felt that they could
know the past;

00:08:10.939 --> 00:08:15.359
when they had gained a certain
distance from it,

00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:20.250
it would become knowable,
that objective distance.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:25.201
And so, any historian worth his
salt would probably be loath to

00:08:25.201 --> 00:08:29.753
write about something too
recent, because that wasn't what

00:08:29.753 --> 00:08:34.088
history was all about.
History was about getting

00:08:34.088 --> 00:08:39.960
perspective, the perspective and
objectivity that time provides.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.978
Well, in the mid twentieth
century this vision of history

00:08:42.978 --> 00:08:45.242
began to change,
and I'm going to mention a

00:08:45.242 --> 00:08:48.585
couple of figures here that are
especially relevant to literary

00:08:48.585 --> 00:08:51.812
studies.
One is Michel Foucault,

00:08:51.812 --> 00:08:56.389
a French historian and
philosopher who in the 1960s

00:08:56.389 --> 00:09:02.157
began to argue that history was
best understood as the evolution

00:09:02.157 --> 00:09:06.433
of discursive systems,
systems, essentially,

00:09:06.433 --> 00:09:10.040
of language married to
institutional power,

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.934
and that those systems were
properly understood as shaping

00:09:14.934 --> 00:09:19.486
what we could know and the
social identities one could

00:09:19.486 --> 00:09:24.465
inhabit at any given time.
So, in the early '60s he writes

00:09:24.465 --> 00:09:28.124
about the history of insanity;
he writes about the history of

00:09:28.124 --> 00:09:30.863
sexuality;
he writes about the history of

00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:36.471
prisons and discipline.
And he argues that institutions

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:43.820
like the asylum and the prison
form modern subjectivities,

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:50.190
form how it is that we think we
can be people and know things.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:57.696
So, the argument goes something
like: you can't be a modern

00:09:57.696 --> 00:10:03.638
madman without the asylum.
It's not like madness existed,

00:10:03.638 --> 00:10:07.269
and then asylums got built to
take care of it.

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:13.809
He sees the rise of the asylum
and the rise of clinical

00:10:13.809 --> 00:10:18.169
insanity as requiring one
another;

00:10:18.169 --> 00:10:19.970
you can't have one without the
other.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.221
So, it's the rise of the
defining institution that maps

00:10:24.221 --> 00:10:28.080
directly onto the rise of any
condition like that:

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.857
similarly sexuality,
laws that govern deviants,

00:10:32.857 --> 00:10:37.409
norms of behavior that
stabilize gender.

00:10:37.409 --> 00:10:40.688
There are some wonderful
stories from medieval French

00:10:40.688 --> 00:10:43.399
literature, for,
example that Foucault talks

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:47.188
about,
that feature girls who jump

00:10:47.188 --> 00:10:51.750
over ditches and suddenly become
boys.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:55.525
There is this sense of
instability of gender that he

00:10:55.525 --> 00:10:58.559
brings out of some historical
material,

00:10:58.559 --> 00:11:03.040
and then he talks about how we
came to believe that gender was

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.860
stable, and what discursive
systems were required,

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.770
what laws, what kinds of
etiquette, what kinds of

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.413
education were required to make
us believe that gender was

00:11:15.413 --> 00:11:18.899
stable,
among other things.

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:22.648
So, this kind of history
suggests a couple of things to

00:11:22.648 --> 00:11:24.909
those of us who study
literature,

00:11:24.909 --> 00:11:27.995
and it did so very powerfully
in the 1980s,

00:11:27.995 --> 00:11:30.860
and that is that discourse,
language,

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.512
is extremely powerful.
It affects how we can know

00:11:35.512 --> 00:11:38.378
anything.
It's not just the medium in

00:11:38.378 --> 00:11:40.830
which we can describe what we
know.

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:46.850
It's that very foundation
through which we know anything.

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:52.190
And I think some of the
revisionist history that you see

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:58.112
taking place in fiction-- and
here I'll have recourse again to

00:11:58.112 --> 00:12:04.035
Beloved--demonstrates the
belief in language's power to

00:12:04.035 --> 00:12:07.274
make history.
Toni Morrison is,

00:12:07.274 --> 00:12:10.662
in Beloved,
looking towards fiction to

00:12:10.662 --> 00:12:13.916
do something else,
too, and that's to replace lost

00:12:13.916 --> 00:12:15.943
history.
Another development,

00:12:15.943 --> 00:12:18.560
out of Foucault's work and the
work of others,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.770
is an interrogation of the
archive.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:24.759
What's in the archive?
What kind of archive do we use?

00:12:24.759 --> 00:12:27.887
If you're interested in the
history of institutions,

00:12:27.887 --> 00:12:31.750
that's a very different-looking
historical archive than it would

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:35.000
be if you just think that great
men make history.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.038
So, then you go and you look at
the lives of the great men over

00:12:38.038 --> 00:12:41.376
time who have made history.
That's a very different-looking

00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:45.210
archive, or if you think that
history is made by governments.

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.544
So, there's a whole
movement in the '80s and '90s,

00:12:49.544 --> 00:12:53.715
the new social history,
that takes the archive to be

00:12:53.715 --> 00:12:59.427
much broader than it was before,
to include all kinds of things

00:12:59.427 --> 00:13:04.517
that common people experienced.
So, the letters of factory

00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:08.873
workers, the popular magazines
and so on, all kinds of

00:13:08.873 --> 00:13:11.379
ephemera,
what historians would call

00:13:11.379 --> 00:13:14.009
ephemera, came to be important
in a new way.

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:18.903
Morrison uses that to imagine a
history that can't be told

00:13:18.903 --> 00:13:22.080
because there is no archive for
it,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.744
and in the case of
Beloved, it's the

00:13:24.744 --> 00:13:26.919
history of the illiterate slave
woman.

00:13:26.919 --> 00:13:30.931
She finds a newspaper cutting
about a woman who killed her

00:13:30.931 --> 00:13:34.519
children rather than have them
return to slavery,

00:13:34.519 --> 00:13:38.932
and she lets fiction do the
work that history cannot do,

00:13:38.932 --> 00:13:41.740
which is tell that woman's
story.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:45.284
So, it's a kind of recovery
that the new social history and

00:13:45.284 --> 00:13:48.705
the developments coming out of
Foucault's work are making

00:13:48.705 --> 00:13:51.149
happen in the discipline of
history.

00:13:51.149 --> 00:13:53.725
Here it's happening in
literature and having its

00:13:53.725 --> 00:13:56.577
effects in literature.
There's one other historian

00:13:56.577 --> 00:13:58.759
I want to mention,
and that's Hayden White.

00:13:58.759 --> 00:14:02.584
Hayden White was a historian
who argued that our notions of

00:14:02.584 --> 00:14:06.210
how history should be written
are deeply informed by our

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.980
understandings of how narratives
work,

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.717
so this is part of the
overthrow of what you might call

00:14:12.717 --> 00:14:17.009
teleological history,
the idea that history has a

00:14:17.009 --> 00:14:22.659
trajectory, that it has a goal.
And this would be related to,

00:14:22.659 --> 00:14:27.643
history is about either the
inevitable rise of certain kinds

00:14:27.643 --> 00:14:32.200
of humanist thought in the West,
or about the decline of

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.459
civilizations over time.
Both of those versions of

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:39.120
history are teleological.
They suggest that history has a

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.697
point.
Hayden White read history like

00:14:42.697 --> 00:14:45.821
literature.
He argued that historical

00:14:45.821 --> 00:14:49.884
accounts were emplotted,
that they were shaped in their

00:14:49.884 --> 00:14:53.722
argument by the very
expectations set up by literary

00:14:53.722 --> 00:14:56.530
works.
So, we expect stories to go a

00:14:56.530 --> 00:15:00.149
certain way, and so that's how
history gets written.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:06.621
I think that Jones is somewhat
more interested in this second

00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:12.173
version of the new history,
a history that's very aware of

00:15:12.173 --> 00:15:15.566
its plotting,
and it's this question of the

00:15:15.566 --> 00:15:20.090
grand narrative of history
that's very much at issue.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.059
How do you know where history
is tending?

00:15:24.059 --> 00:15:27.750
This is certainly a question
for Jones.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:31.110
And I'm going to now just
say one small thing,

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.058
and I'm going to come back to
this question,

00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:37.830
in the course of this lecture,
about postmodernism.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:42.752
So, one feature of what is
called postmodernism is this

00:15:42.752 --> 00:15:47.246
decline of the grand narrative.
So, when Jean-Francois Lyotard

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:50.019
wrote something called The
Postmodern Condition,

00:15:50.019 --> 00:15:53.815
he argued that we could
have no overarching cultural

00:15:53.815 --> 00:15:56.230
narratives, religious
narratives,

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:59.712
historical narratives,
social narratives,

00:15:59.712 --> 00:16:03.370
moral narratives,
in the postmodern age,

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:07.139
because in the postmodern age
everything is fragmented.

00:16:07.139 --> 00:16:10.570
Fragmentation is the hallmark
of the postmodern for him.

00:16:10.570 --> 00:16:14.451
It has to do with the rise of
global capitalism,

00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:19.324
and this is an argument that is
related to Fredric Jameson's

00:16:19.324 --> 00:16:25.142
argument about postmodernism,
and Jameson and Lyotard are

00:16:25.142 --> 00:16:29.884
parallel in their analysis.
They give different value to

00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:32.240
this tradition--to this
condition (sorry).

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:36.976
Lyotard celebrates it.
It's a kind of freedom for him,

00:16:36.976 --> 00:16:39.779
the freedom from the grand
narrative.

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:46.095
Jameson is much more skeptical
about its qualities,

00:16:46.095 --> 00:16:51.779
and sees it largely as damaging
to persons.

00:16:51.779 --> 00:16:57.364
So, one question we want to ask
is, if there are any grand

00:16:57.364 --> 00:17:02.460
narratives in Jones,
are they seen as consolatory?

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:07.974
Do they provide any
compensation for the sufferings

00:17:07.974 --> 00:17:11.092
of the present?
So, this is one question I

00:17:11.092 --> 00:17:12.789
want you to, sort of,
hold in your mind.

00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:16.999
What is this novel's attitude
toward narrative as such,

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:20.819
both on the small level and on
the grand level?

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.559
On the small level it's a
little more apparent.

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:28.810
It's clear the novel values the
tiny version of narrative.

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:33.821
Does it value the large version?
So, with all those sort of

00:17:33.821 --> 00:17:37.950
abstract questions in mind,
I want to turn to the novel and

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:41.696
look at how knowledge,
especially knowledge of

00:17:41.696 --> 00:17:45.630
history, knowledge of the past,
is generated.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:52.348
And the first example I want to
turn to is that of Moses telling

00:17:52.348 --> 00:17:58.320
Caldonia the story of Henry's
building the plantation.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.560
This is on page 209.

00:18:09.589 --> 00:18:14.753
So, this is after Henry's
death, and Caldonia calls Moses

00:18:14.753 --> 00:18:19.917
in, and as a way of comforting,
Moses begins to tell this

00:18:19.917 --> 00:18:22.386
story.
Moses took his eyes from

00:18:22.386 --> 00:18:25.325
his lap and began to invent some
early days when they were

00:18:25.325 --> 00:18:28.624
building the house and there was
not much on the land except what

00:18:28.624 --> 00:18:31.446
God had put there.
Caldonia was at the edge of the

00:18:31.446 --> 00:18:34.921
settee in her mourning dress.
"Now, Master Henry always

00:18:34.921 --> 00:18:38.251
knowed what kind of house he
wanted to build,

00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:40.581
Mistress.
I don't even think he knowed

00:18:40.581 --> 00:18:43.678
about you that particular time,
but he must have had some idea

00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:47.130
that you was out there somewhere
waitin' in your own kind of way,

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:50.300
'cause he set up about building
a house that you would want.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.363
He built it up from nothin'.
I was there,

00:18:52.363 --> 00:18:54.559
but I wasn't there like he was
there.

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:58.039
He said to me that first day,
he said, 'Moses we gonna start

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:00.803
with the kitchen.
A wife needs a place to fix her

00:19:00.803 --> 00:19:03.807
meals for her family.
Thas' where we gonna start,'

00:19:03.807 --> 00:19:07.220
and he bent down and Mastah
drove in that first nail,

00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.668
bam.
That was a Monday,

00:19:08.668 --> 00:19:11.688
Mistress, 'cause Mastah Henry
didn't believe in startin'

00:19:11.688 --> 00:19:13.720
somethin' on a Sunday,
God's day."

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:18.405
Caldonia, her hands clasped in
her lap, leaned back and closed

00:19:18.405 --> 00:19:20.833
her eyes.
The story about the first nail

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:23.894
came a little more than a month
after Henry had been in his

00:19:23.894 --> 00:19:26.316
grave.
It was gospel among slaves that

00:19:26.316 --> 00:19:30.021
one of the quickest ways to hell
was to tell lies about dead

00:19:30.021 --> 00:19:32.273
people,
but Moses did not think about

00:19:32.273 --> 00:19:35.521
that as he spoke of the first
nail, did not think about the

00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:38.210
dead needing the truth to be
told about them.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.348
He did not think about it until
that day Oden Peoples,

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:44.249
the Cherokee patroller,
said to the men around him

00:19:44.249 --> 00:19:46.500
about Moses, "Heft him on up
here.

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:50.211
I'll take him in.
He ain't gonna bleed for

00:19:50.211 --> 00:19:54.809
long."
There are all kinds of cues in

00:19:54.809 --> 00:20:00.859
this little, tiny passage to the
production of knowledge.

00:20:00.859 --> 00:20:04.938
So, first of all,
let me point out a literary

00:20:04.938 --> 00:20:09.480
resonance, and that's to
Faulkner's Absalom,

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:13.269
Absalom,
which is the story of Henry

00:20:13.269 --> 00:20:17.146
Sutpen, another Henry,
and the way he built a

00:20:17.146 --> 00:20:21.985
plantation out of nothing.
And what's remarkable about

00:20:21.985 --> 00:20:26.619
Sutpen, his overarching and
overwhelming characteristic,

00:20:26.619 --> 00:20:32.742
is that he had a plan,
a plan that reached all the way

00:20:32.742 --> 00:20:38.554
down through his heirs,
and part of that plan was the

00:20:38.554 --> 00:20:44.099
unblemished whiteness of the
line he was establishing.

00:20:44.099 --> 00:20:49.223
So, this story about another
Henry, another Master Henry,

00:20:49.223 --> 00:20:55.170
pulling a plantation out of the
wilderness with his bare hands,

00:20:55.170 --> 00:21:00.640
echoes those literary stories
that we have in our minds.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.556
Now, of course we aren't to
believe that Moses has read

00:21:05.556 --> 00:21:10.222
Absalom, Absalom.
It's not that Moses is

00:21:10.222 --> 00:21:16.265
taking that story in particular,
but just that for Moses the

00:21:16.265 --> 00:21:22.410
story of a masterful creator is
already in his vocabulary and

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:28.350
for Jones that he wants to have
us think about stories like

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.242
that.
So, this is what it calls to

00:21:31.242 --> 00:21:32.430
mind on two levels.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:39.699
He deliberately casts it,
Moses does, as a godlike

00:21:39.699 --> 00:21:44.653
creation, having him start on a
Monday as if it were the first

00:21:44.653 --> 00:21:49.770
day of God's seven days of
creation in the Book of Genesis.

00:21:52.849 --> 00:21:58.754
Now, then you get warnings:
"The quickest way to hell was

00:21:58.754 --> 00:22:05.279
to tell lies about dead people."
That knowledge suggests a whole

00:22:05.279 --> 00:22:11.740
body of oral tradition among the
slaves, so it is folk wisdom;

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.130
it is a folk warning.

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:21.577
What Moses does,
then, is stand up against folk

00:22:21.577 --> 00:22:28.127
wisdom, and he takes on for
himself the power of a masterful

00:22:28.127 --> 00:22:32.531
creator.
So, he does himself what he

00:22:32.531 --> 00:22:37.940
assigns to Henry.
He becomes a creator,

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:43.446
here, in language.
The warning from the collective

00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:48.299
wisdom stands at odds with his
individuality at that moment.

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:54.145
It's at odds with his seizing
that power for himself,

00:22:54.145 --> 00:23:00.890
and we will see as the novel
goes on the repercussions of his

00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:07.410
having done that for the slaves
in the slave quarters.

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.002
It will have serious
repercussions,

00:23:10.002 --> 00:23:13.815
some good, some bad,
and here we're told that there

00:23:13.815 --> 00:23:16.789
is something in the future for
him,

00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:21.362
too, that is a repercussion,
that involves blood and his

00:23:21.362 --> 00:23:22.360
disabling.

00:23:25.869 --> 00:23:30.579
This kind of knowledge is that
old, familiar friend:

00:23:30.579 --> 00:23:33.720
foreshadowing,
of course.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:37.012
So, this is yet another
kind of knowledge that Jones

00:23:37.012 --> 00:23:40.587
puts in front of us.
It's the proleptic knowledge,

00:23:40.587 --> 00:23:45.414
the knowledge looking ahead to
the future, that the author of a

00:23:45.414 --> 00:23:49.539
grand narrative is in the sole
position of giving.

00:23:49.539 --> 00:23:53.410
It's the prerogative of the
maker to tell us what's coming

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:57.281
next, because it's only the
maker who knows what the whole

00:23:57.281 --> 00:24:00.887
is looking like,
what the whole will look like,

00:24:00.887 --> 00:24:04.857
because it's the maker's
intention that will determine

00:24:04.857 --> 00:24:10.299
everything that happens.
And so, there's yet this other

00:24:10.299 --> 00:24:16.719
layer of knowledge and of voice.
There is a narrator in the mix

00:24:16.719 --> 00:24:19.821
here who is not Moses,
who is Jones,

00:24:19.821 --> 00:24:25.725
or the writer of this novel,
whoever we want to imagine that

00:24:25.725 --> 00:24:31.630
to be--we'll call him Jones--who
knows something that Moses

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.306
doesn't.
We are put in the position of

00:24:35.306 --> 00:24:40.859
being on the same plane as that
creator, so it puts Moses in the

00:24:40.859 --> 00:24:44.650
tragic position of not knowing
his fate.

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:48.819
He's a little like Oedipus in
this way, that the gods all know

00:24:48.819 --> 00:24:52.921
what the facts are about his
life, and the life of the world,

00:24:52.921 --> 00:24:55.480
but he doesn't.
He blunders along.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:59.059
There is that ironic distance
between the knowledge of the

00:24:59.059 --> 00:25:02.700
audience and the knowledge of
the character in the dramatic

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:06.684
situation,
so Moses is in that position

00:25:06.684 --> 00:25:10.029
here.
Now, what is exactly he

00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:16.499
lying about?
Well, we get other versions of

00:25:16.499 --> 00:25:23.288
Henry's beginning.
On 122, we see a slightly

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:29.603
different story,
and I'm not going to read too

00:25:29.603 --> 00:25:34.693
much out of here.
But if you turn there,

00:25:34.693 --> 00:25:40.920
you'll recall that early in the
building of the plantation,

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.952
Moses and Henry are tussling in
the dirt, when William Robbins

00:25:45.952 --> 00:25:49.452
rides up.
And Robbins makes a point of

00:25:49.452 --> 00:25:55.376
scolding Henry for thinking that
he is somehow not different from

00:25:55.376 --> 00:25:59.286
his slave,
and he advises him that he must

00:25:59.286 --> 00:26:03.740
make that a bright and enduring
line between them.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:09.102
So, this plantation is founded
on the white man's policing the

00:26:09.102 --> 00:26:13.761
divide between master and slave,
even after his slave,

00:26:13.761 --> 00:26:16.750
Henry, has bought his freedom.

00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:25.689
So, it's perpetuated between
Robbins and Henry,

00:26:25.689 --> 00:26:31.472
that seigniorial power,
and Henry acquiesces and

00:26:31.472 --> 00:26:36.640
disciplines Moses in an
arbitrary way.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:40.358
Moses, when he comes--when
Henry comes--back from speaking

00:26:40.358 --> 00:26:43.620
with William Robbins,
wants to continue working.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.790
Moses loves to work.
He loves the completion of work.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:52.123
He is a very fine builder.
We learn in the scene that he

00:26:52.123 --> 00:26:56.178
can build in the dark just by
feel and by the sense of the

00:26:56.178 --> 00:27:01.334
place of things.
And so, Moses is told not to

00:27:01.334 --> 00:27:04.140
work.
Henry slaps him,

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:11.480
and Moses then keeps on working
anyway after Henry leaves.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:16.218
So, in that story,
Moses is the maker,

00:27:16.218 --> 00:27:20.717
not so much Henry.
And, if there is an origin,

00:27:20.717 --> 00:27:24.088
before that scene of Moses
building in the dark,

00:27:24.088 --> 00:27:28.250
it's a scene of the two of them
tussling on the ground.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.700
So, William Robbins is right.
There is a blurring of the

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.359
distinction between master and
slave.

00:27:34.359 --> 00:27:38.808
It's that, and it's sundering,
that is the origin of the

00:27:38.808 --> 00:27:42.095
plantation.
And we're told also in this

00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:46.896
chapter that he hadn't even
thought--he, Henry--hadn't even

00:27:46.896 --> 00:27:51.709
thought about Caldonia yet.
Equally, we learn,

00:27:51.709 --> 00:27:58.052
in passing, on page 59,
that very soon before that

00:27:58.052 --> 00:28:05.301
scene of him and Moses that
Henry was already dreaming of

00:28:05.301 --> 00:28:09.136
his plantation.
This is at the very bottom of

00:28:09.136 --> 00:28:09.610
the page:

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:16.119
Moses made to go down the
lane of cabins,

00:28:16.119 --> 00:28:19.529
eight on one side of the lane
and eight on the otherside,

00:28:19.529 --> 00:28:23.350
laid out just the way Henry
Townsend had seen them in a

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:27.595
dream when he was twenty-one
years old and without a slave to

00:28:27.595 --> 00:28:31.738
his name.
It's not a kitchen for a future

00:28:31.738 --> 00:28:37.515
wife, but a line of slave cabins
for his future slaves that Henry

00:28:37.515 --> 00:28:41.380
has in mind.
That's the origin that Moses is

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.509
lying about, so there are two
layers of lies here.

00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:50.977
One is the lie about the
plantation being built on a

00:28:50.977 --> 00:28:56.230
vision of slavery,
and two is the lie on its being

00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:58.910
built by Henry alone.

00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:07.041
So, Moses, in telling his
story, asserting his authority

00:29:07.041 --> 00:29:10.598
to tell history,
effaces himself from that

00:29:10.598 --> 00:29:15.094
history,
and also effaces the line of

00:29:15.094 --> 00:29:20.029
difference between slave and not
slave.

00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:23.705
He doesn't say it was built on
that distinction,

00:29:23.705 --> 00:29:28.734
and that serves his purposes,
of course, because his stories

00:29:28.734 --> 00:29:33.857
to Caldonia will have as their
final dream the effacement of

00:29:33.857 --> 00:29:37.069
the line between him and
Caldonia.

00:29:37.069 --> 00:29:41.651
His dream is that she will see
him as the next Mr.

00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:47.447
Townsend, and we'll see by the
end of the novel what happens to

00:29:47.447 --> 00:29:50.701
that dream.
So, how do you know about

00:29:50.701 --> 00:29:53.288
the past?
Caldonia can only know about

00:29:53.288 --> 00:29:56.836
that past through Moses,
and we've seen that it's an

00:29:56.836 --> 00:30:00.106
incredibly complex view
backward, with all these

00:30:00.106 --> 00:30:03.651
layerings.
And once again we're asked to

00:30:03.651 --> 00:30:09.000
stand in the position of knowing
more, even, than Moses does.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.180
We know about Henry's dream of
the line of slave cabins.

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:17.788
Moses doesn't know that piece,
so there is that difference

00:30:17.788 --> 00:30:22.469
cropping up.
On page 75, you have another

00:30:22.469 --> 00:30:26.779
version of telling those
stories.

00:30:26.779 --> 00:30:30.333
When Augustus and
Mildred, Henry's parents,

00:30:30.333 --> 00:30:34.109
lay down and held each other
after Henry's death,

00:30:34.109 --> 00:30:37.240
one of them started
talking--they would not remember

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:40.556
which one it was--all about
Henry from his birth to his

00:30:40.556 --> 00:30:43.409
death,
starting a weeks-long project

00:30:43.409 --> 00:30:47.269
of recalling all that they could
about their son.

00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:51.077
If they had known how to read
and write, they could have put

00:30:51.077 --> 00:30:54.109
it all in a book of two thousand
pages.

00:30:54.109 --> 00:30:57.069
This is a very different kind
of telling.

00:30:57.069 --> 00:31:00.315
If there is a literary model
here, it's that of Odysseus and

00:31:00.315 --> 00:31:02.189
Penelope.
I don't know if any of you have

00:31:02.189 --> 00:31:04.749
read The Odyssey.
There's this beautiful

00:31:04.749 --> 00:31:07.821
scene, at the end,
when Odysseus finally reaches

00:31:07.821 --> 00:31:11.940
Ithaca, and he and Penelope stay
up all night telling each other

00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:15.279
stories;
they talk all night.

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:18.059
And so that's the vision you
have here.

00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:22.553
It's a private exchange of
history, and we're not told all

00:31:22.553 --> 00:31:26.180
the things that occur in their
conversation.

00:31:26.180 --> 00:31:30.440
That is a kind of storytelling
that is compensation for loss.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.748
It's history as compensation,
and this is much more in the

00:31:34.748 --> 00:31:38.829
realm of what Toni Morrison is
doing in her fiction,

00:31:38.829 --> 00:31:44.640
fiction as filling in the gaps
of loss as best fiction can.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:48.542
Now there's no fantasy about
how complete that could ever be,

00:31:48.542 --> 00:31:52.769
but there is the effort and the
effort honors what's been lost,

00:31:52.769 --> 00:31:57.536
and here Augustus and Mildred
honor their ambivalent love for

00:31:57.536 --> 00:32:00.896
their son.
They completely disagree with

00:32:00.896 --> 00:32:05.626
what he has done in his life,
and yet they honor that loss

00:32:05.626 --> 00:32:10.274
telling stories to one another
and they blend together as

00:32:10.274 --> 00:32:12.970
people,
as separate people, in that act.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:24.158
On 239, we can see yet a
third version of how history and

00:32:24.158 --> 00:32:29.556
the world make sense,
and this is when Counsel

00:32:29.556 --> 00:32:35.800
Skiffington rides into Texas
after his plantation burns down.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.604
How do you know anything?
Well, as he meets the sort of

00:32:39.604 --> 00:32:43.434
motley crews of people that he
meets on the road,

00:32:43.434 --> 00:32:47.743
he continually thinks back to
the burned library at his

00:32:47.743 --> 00:32:50.328
plantation.
(And this is in the middle of

00:32:50.328 --> 00:32:52.641
the page.)
He had seen a dark old

00:32:52.641 --> 00:32:55.234
man driving the wagon,
not really a Negro,

00:32:55.234 --> 00:32:59.092
not really from any race that
was recorded in any of the books

00:32:59.092 --> 00:33:02.528
in his destroyed library.
[And then a little further

00:33:02.528 --> 00:33:04.541
down]
When he turned from the wagon

00:33:04.541 --> 00:33:07.501
with the pregnant women,
a boy smiling with perfect

00:33:07.501 --> 00:33:11.228
teeth was facing him.
He knew the origins of this one

00:33:11.228 --> 00:33:14.900
from another of the destroyed
books, someone from the

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.690
Orient.
Counsel brings with him from

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:24.009
the destroyed library the
categories of knowledge that he

00:33:24.009 --> 00:33:27.809
hopes will make the world make
sense.

00:33:27.809 --> 00:33:33.157
It fails him,
often, as in the brown man he

00:33:33.157 --> 00:33:38.250
can't quite categorize from the
books.

00:33:38.250 --> 00:33:42.270
It gives him satisfactions on
those occasions when its

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:46.244
categories do apply.
So, Counsel is a model for that

00:33:46.244 --> 00:33:50.631
person who takes the discursive
knowledge of his culture and

00:33:50.631 --> 00:33:54.200
tries to fit the world he
encounters into it,

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.390
and he's troubled when it
doesn't work.

00:33:57.390 --> 00:34:01.249
So, this is a mode of knowledge
that fits quite nicely with what

00:34:01.249 --> 00:34:05.077
I've been telling you,
in a sort of simplified way,

00:34:05.077 --> 00:34:09.539
about Foucault's understanding
of how history works.

00:34:09.539 --> 00:34:12.244
And so, here,
you have a version of that

00:34:12.244 --> 00:34:14.740
right in the character of
Counsel.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.982
So, some of the problems
that these scenes point up are:

00:34:24.982 --> 00:34:28.555
how can the knower know
anything, when the knower

00:34:28.555 --> 00:34:31.980
himself or herself is a
fragmented person?

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:34.555
And, I think,
the fragmenting of knowledge

00:34:34.555 --> 00:34:38.010
across layers--what do we know,
what does Moses know,

00:34:38.010 --> 00:34:42.608
what does Caldonia know,
what does the narrator seem to

00:34:42.608 --> 00:34:47.376
know--that fragmentation makes
it impossible to imagine a

00:34:47.376 --> 00:34:51.974
subjectivity for any of these
characters that can truly

00:34:51.974 --> 00:34:57.159
encompass a stable world view.
So, that fragmentation of self

00:34:57.159 --> 00:35:00.409
is another layer of the problem
of knowledge.

00:35:00.409 --> 00:35:06.168
How can you know anything,
when you're not a stable knower

00:35:06.168 --> 00:35:08.964
yourself?
And I just want to look

00:35:08.964 --> 00:35:12.083
back to some of the other
readings on our syllabus,

00:35:12.083 --> 00:35:15.639
to think about how these
problems have been addressed.

00:35:15.639 --> 00:35:18.691
So, how do you know about the
past in Robinson,

00:35:18.691 --> 00:35:22.478
for Marilynne Robinson?
For her, writing is the

00:35:22.478 --> 00:35:27.659
transcription of consciousness,
of human consciousness.

00:35:27.659 --> 00:35:31.843
There is an endless present to
her work and when she talks

00:35:31.843 --> 00:35:35.072
about writers from the
nineteenth century for

00:35:35.072 --> 00:35:38.376
example--Hawthorne,
Dickinson, Emerson,

00:35:38.376 --> 00:35:41.950
Thoreau--she calls them aunts
and uncles.

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:45.034
I think it's very telling.
It's as if they were part of

00:35:45.034 --> 00:35:48.768
her family, part of her present,
and I think that's indicative

00:35:48.768 --> 00:35:52.380
of how she thinks of writing and
its access to the past.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:57.298
Because writing is continuous
with consciousness,

00:35:57.298 --> 00:36:01.909
you can simply know the past by
reading it.

00:36:01.909 --> 00:36:06.110
And if you read her essays on
history, that's fully borne out

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:08.630
in the assumptions that she
makes.

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:13.090
If you think about Cormac
McCarthy, how can you know the

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:16.031
past?
Well, his trans-historical

00:36:16.031 --> 00:36:21.597
vision suggests that to know the
past is simply to know human

00:36:21.597 --> 00:36:26.699
nature, or to know human nature
is to know the past.

00:36:26.699 --> 00:36:31.402
So, remember those epigraphs
about the ancient evidence of

00:36:31.402 --> 00:36:34.775
scalping.
It suggests that the human

00:36:34.775 --> 00:36:39.800
tendency towards violence has no
origin, has no end.

00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:44.690
It's a different kind of
eternal present from Robinson's,

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:49.754
and yet it is still one that
gives him a seamless access to

00:36:49.754 --> 00:36:52.635
the past,
so he can make modern

00:36:52.635 --> 00:36:56.874
U.S.-Mexico border look very
much like, for example,

00:36:56.874 --> 00:37:01.860
the U.S.-Mexico border in the
1840s (and this is later in his

00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:06.764
Border Trilogy when you
see the nuclear tests in this

00:37:06.764 --> 00:37:11.419
same landscape that we've seen
all the action of Blood

00:37:11.419 --> 00:37:15.789
Meridian).
So, he makes those two look

00:37:15.789 --> 00:37:18.908
very similar in that landscape.
Philip Roth:

00:37:18.908 --> 00:37:22.065
how do you know the past?
Well, this is a major theme of

00:37:22.065 --> 00:37:24.340
my lecture on Wednesday of last
week.

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:30.170
How does Nathan know any of
Coleman's past?

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:33.660
He has to rely on other
narrators.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:37.993
We have to rely on him.
I was questioning his

00:37:37.993 --> 00:37:42.141
credibility as a narrator,
as someone who could tell us

00:37:42.141 --> 00:37:45.137
about the past,
so there's that level of

00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:48.975
problem raised in that novel.
At the same time,

00:37:48.975 --> 00:37:51.788
like McCarthy,
he has a trans-historical

00:37:51.788 --> 00:37:55.610
understanding of what access to
the past would be,

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:59.380
through the trans-historical
theme of desire.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:03.989
So, desire is the same now as
it was in Hawthorne's time.

00:38:03.989 --> 00:38:10.081
The desire to purify the
American libido in the Monica

00:38:10.081 --> 00:38:16.506
Lewinsky trial is not different,
for Roth, from the spasm of

00:38:16.506 --> 00:38:21.818
purification that Hawthorne
writes about in The Scarlet

00:38:21.818 --> 00:38:25.270
Letter.
So, that is a different

00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:29.564
vision of what it means to be
trans-historical,

00:38:29.564 --> 00:38:34.979
and I think it allows for Roth
that fearless setting of the

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:39.295
contemporary.
He doesn't look to a historical

00:38:39.295 --> 00:38:42.440
setting that's distant from
himself.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.626
He sees the present as history.
And, if you believe in the

00:38:46.626 --> 00:38:48.683
trans-historical,
you can make that move,

00:38:48.683 --> 00:38:51.407
'cause you don't need the
distance from history to get

00:38:51.407 --> 00:38:54.561
objective purchase on it.
It's all, sort of,

00:38:54.561 --> 00:38:57.616
part of the same story.
And then,

00:38:57.616 --> 00:39:01.868
if you think about The Woman
Warrior: how do you

00:39:01.868 --> 00:39:06.119
get a usable past out of the
layers and layers of secrecy,

00:39:06.119 --> 00:39:09.947
partial narration,
fragmentation that you get from

00:39:09.947 --> 00:39:14.477
parents telling you stories
about your past and about their

00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:17.412
past?
Well, you have to stitch it

00:39:17.412 --> 00:39:22.862
together.
So, her argument is that the

00:39:22.862 --> 00:39:28.969
past is what you make it usable
for;

00:39:28.969 --> 00:39:33.679
the past becomes its use for
you.

00:39:33.679 --> 00:39:38.340
She builds a self out of that
past.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:44.388
In the face of these
difficulties,

00:39:44.388 --> 00:39:49.099
empathy and sentiment come to
be much more powerful,

00:39:49.099 --> 00:39:52.244
and I think the writers in this
part of the syllabus,

00:39:52.244 --> 00:39:55.752
this last part of the syllabus,
depend a lot on sentiment,

00:39:55.752 --> 00:39:59.360
and because of that they look
back to the nineteenth century.

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.940
Edward P.
Jones is very busy using the

00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:05.010
tools of the nineteenth-century
narrative.

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:08.641
The omniscient narrator is very
much characteristic of

00:40:08.641 --> 00:40:12.264
nineteenth-century novels.
So, if you read Harriet Beecher

00:40:12.264 --> 00:40:14.574
Stowe for example,
if any of you have taken

00:40:14.574 --> 00:40:16.829
English 127a and have read that
novel,

00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:24.078
you'll remember all the very
broad addresses to the reader

00:40:24.078 --> 00:40:29.557
about what's going on.
There is that omniscient sense

00:40:29.557 --> 00:40:34.090
that the narrator has all the
pieces under her control.

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:39.623
Jones looks back to that
tradition and borrows from it,

00:40:39.623 --> 00:40:43.213
also, fearlessly.
This has been,

00:40:43.213 --> 00:40:48.731
since modernism,
quite a less distinguished mode

00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:53.488
of narration.
So he's trading modernist

00:40:53.488 --> 00:40:57.837
limitation of knowledge.
If any of you have read Henry

00:40:57.837 --> 00:41:01.764
James, my favorite example is
this novel called What Maisie

00:41:01.764 --> 00:41:04.069
Knew,
which is told in free

00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:08.150
indirect discourse through the
consciousness of a child,

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:11.384
Maisie, who is the child of an
aristocratic family,

00:41:11.384 --> 00:41:15.329
the parents of whom are always
having extramarital affairs.

00:41:15.329 --> 00:41:18.907
It's a very confusing family to
be living in,

00:41:18.907 --> 00:41:22.971
for this young girl,
and the narrative is extremely

00:41:22.971 --> 00:41:26.131
confusing.
Well, Jones will have nothing

00:41:26.131 --> 00:41:29.825
to do with that kind of
partiality, that kind of limit

00:41:29.825 --> 00:41:32.995
on perception,
so he has left behind those

00:41:32.995 --> 00:41:37.188
modernist experiments with
transcribing the very limits of

00:41:37.188 --> 00:41:40.845
human consciousness,
and he is up in the God

00:41:40.845 --> 00:41:44.349
consciousness of the nineteenth
century.

00:41:44.349 --> 00:41:50.260
Is that God consciousness any
consolation?

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:54.120
Well, if we look at page 51,
this is just one tiny example.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.907
They're all over the place.
This is one of those tiny

00:41:57.907 --> 00:42:01.621
interpolated stories about the
woman who opens the box of

00:42:01.621 --> 00:42:04.539
walking sticks and Rita is
hiding inside.

00:42:04.539 --> 00:42:09.590
She's escaped from Robbins'
plantation.

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:13.800
So this is her little story,
the bottom paragraph.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.862
Mary O'Donnell Conlon
would never live comfortably in

00:42:16.862 --> 00:42:19.631
America.
[She comes over from Ireland.]

00:42:19.631 --> 00:42:24.190
Long before the HMS Thames had
even seen the American shore,

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:28.031
America, the land of promise
and hope, had reached out across

00:42:28.031 --> 00:42:31.873
the sea and taken her husband,
a man who had taken her heart

00:42:31.873 --> 00:42:34.532
and kept it, and America had
taken her baby,

00:42:34.532 --> 00:42:37.871
two innocent beings in the
vastness of a world with all

00:42:37.871 --> 00:42:41.210
kinds of things that could have
been taken first.

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:45.530
She held nothing against God.
God was simply being God.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:50.296
But she could not forgive
America, and saw it as the cause

00:42:50.296 --> 00:42:53.979
of all her misery.
So, God is seen,

00:42:53.979 --> 00:42:56.622
in this little,
tiny snippet,

00:42:56.622 --> 00:43:02.190
to be totally arbitrary and I
think that's the sense you get

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:06.719
in most of these passages about
the divine,

00:43:06.719 --> 00:43:14.544
that God allows violent actions
to occur without seeming cause,

00:43:14.544 --> 00:43:18.573
without reason,
and it's up to the human beings

00:43:18.573 --> 00:43:21.914
to try to stitch stories
together that can make sense of

00:43:21.914 --> 00:43:24.706
them.
And Mary, in this passage,

00:43:24.706 --> 00:43:30.118
chooses to be angry at America,
instead chooses America as the

00:43:30.118 --> 00:43:35.530
story that will unify these
deaths even in a negative way.

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:40.753
It doesn't offer consolation,
exactly, but at least it offers

00:43:40.753 --> 00:43:45.181
a target for her anger.
And, now I just want to see

00:43:45.181 --> 00:43:47.650
on 176, to look at this with
you.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:57.822
In addition to these tiny
thematic visits to some of these

00:43:57.822 --> 00:44:04.050
questions throughout the novel,
the question of stitching

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:09.451
together--can you stitch
together the events of the world

00:44:09.451 --> 00:44:14.658
according to some larger
consciousness?--this becomes a

00:44:14.658 --> 00:44:18.420
question with formal
implications.

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.953
This is in the middle of 176.
If you remember,

00:44:20.953 --> 00:44:24.415
this is about the trial of Jean
Broussard, who has killed his

00:44:24.415 --> 00:44:28.227
partner.
He is the original person who

00:44:28.227 --> 00:44:34.363
brought Moses into Manchester
County, and this is what we

00:44:34.363 --> 00:44:37.584
learn.
We've just--at the top of page

00:44:37.584 --> 00:44:42.349
176--heard about what happened
to Broussard's family in France.

00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:45.740
If Alm Jorgensen,
[this is the partner]

00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:48.129
the murdered man,
had any heirs,

00:44:48.129 --> 00:44:51.732
no one knew about them.
[Now listen as we go on.]

00:44:51.732 --> 00:44:54.106
The records of the Jean
Broussard trial,

00:44:54.106 --> 00:44:57.759
along with most of the judicial
records of nineteenth-century

00:44:57.759 --> 00:45:00.750
Manchester County,
were destroyed in a 1912 fire

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.602
that killed ten people,
including the Negro caretaker

00:45:03.602 --> 00:45:06.180
of the building where the
records were kept,

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.561
and five dogs and two horses.
The Broussard trial took one

00:45:09.561 --> 00:45:12.914
day, actually part of a day,
the trial itself all that

00:45:12.914 --> 00:45:16.078
morning and the jury
deliberations a portion of the

00:45:16.078 --> 00:45:19.068
summer afternoon.
One of the jurors was a man who

00:45:19.068 --> 00:45:21.800
had studied the law at the
College of William and Mary

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.119
where his father and grandfather
had gone.

00:45:24.119 --> 00:45:25.543
When that man,
Arthur Brindle,

00:45:25.543 --> 00:45:27.360
returned from
college…

00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.769
Okay, and I'm not going to go
into Brindle's story quite yet.

00:45:29.769 --> 00:45:34.808
Notice how, sentence by
sentence, we get from the

00:45:34.808 --> 00:45:41.107
erasure of the past--there are
no records for a whole century

00:45:41.107 --> 00:45:46.880
because of this fire--to
historical detail that makes us

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:52.840
ask where the details come from.
"Destroyed in a 1912 fire that

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:55.926
killed ten people,
including the Negro caretaker

00:45:55.926 --> 00:45:59.049
of the building."
It gets more and more specific:

00:45:59.049 --> 00:46:02.610
where the records were kept,
"and five dogs and two horses,"

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:05.854
animals who you'd think,
maybe, wouldn't be part of the

00:46:05.854 --> 00:46:08.558
public record,
their loss wouldn't necessarily

00:46:08.558 --> 00:46:10.615
be recorded.
We're told, even,

00:46:10.615 --> 00:46:14.225
in the absence of the trial
papers, that it took one day,

00:46:14.225 --> 00:46:16.739
and then it gets even more
specific,

00:46:16.739 --> 00:46:20.141
actually part of the day,
and more specific still,

00:46:20.141 --> 00:46:22.780
which part of it was in the
morning,

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:26.139
the regular trial,
jury deliberation in the

00:46:26.139 --> 00:46:28.619
afternoon.
It was a summer afternoon.

00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:30.935
We know more and more and more,
as we go from sentence to

00:46:30.935 --> 00:46:32.719
sentence.
How do we know all that?

00:46:32.719 --> 00:46:35.309
How does this narrator know all
that?

00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:39.679
Where does this knowledge come
from?

00:46:39.679 --> 00:46:44.259
The knowledge becomes more
and more intimate as this

00:46:44.259 --> 00:46:47.590
passage goes on,
as we learn about Arthur

00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:49.673
Brindle,
his insomnia,

00:46:49.673 --> 00:46:54.425
the way he liked to talk to his
wife as a mode of relaxing

00:46:54.425 --> 00:47:00.168
himself before trying to sleep,
and then we get his reflection,

00:47:00.168 --> 00:47:05.330
finally, on the trial and why
Broussard was convicted,

00:47:05.330 --> 00:47:10.663
and this is on 177.
He says it was not the

00:47:10.663 --> 00:47:15.218
insistence on his American
citizenship that was the

00:47:15.218 --> 00:47:18.238
problem;
it wasn't the fact that his

00:47:18.238 --> 00:47:22.500
partner wasn't an American
citizen that was the problem;

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:26.668
it was the accent.
The accent gave him "the stench

00:47:26.668 --> 00:47:29.350
of a dissembler."
You want to know where that

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:32.270
quotation comes from.
It feels like we're hearing

00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:35.294
Broussard's voice.
Who is there with them in bed

00:47:35.294 --> 00:47:38.463
to tell us this?
Everything Broussard said

00:47:38.463 --> 00:47:42.652
came out warped because of the
accent, even when he spoke his

00:47:42.652 --> 00:47:45.239
own name.
The jurors, the merchant told

00:47:45.239 --> 00:47:48.799
his wife, would have been able
to accept why the partner was

00:47:48.799 --> 00:47:52.298
killed if Broussard had sat on
the stand and told his whole

00:47:52.298 --> 00:47:57.562
story without an accent.
Well, what's interesting here

00:47:57.562 --> 00:48:03.323
is that Jones and Brindle do
tell the story without an

00:48:03.323 --> 00:48:07.335
accent.
Brindle is convinced of the

00:48:07.335 --> 00:48:13.835
man's--not innocence--but the
way he should not be convicted,

00:48:13.835 --> 00:48:19.360
and yet he votes with the
others to convict him.

00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.984
He tells the wife this.
We hear the case without

00:48:23.984 --> 00:48:28.291
accent, but when we do hear the
accent it's very telling where

00:48:28.291 --> 00:48:31.460
we hear it.
If you look back on 171,

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:36.821
and sort of flip through this,
when we feel most Broussard's

00:48:36.821 --> 00:48:40.819
alienness of voice,
it's when he calls slaves

00:48:40.819 --> 00:48:46.989
humans.
This is on 171.

00:48:46.989 --> 00:48:51.768
"See, see, Monsieur Bill,"
"finest humans,

00:48:51.768 --> 00:48:56.429
good humans,
the finer of the slaves,"

00:48:56.429 --> 00:49:00.457
Broussard said,
"but, Monsieur Bill,

00:49:00.457 --> 00:49:05.289
they are finer human beings,"
and so on.

00:49:05.289 --> 00:49:10.071
It's in those moments that he
speaks something closest to the

00:49:10.071 --> 00:49:13.419
truth, right,
that we can hear him speaking

00:49:13.419 --> 00:49:17.868
to us the truth of slavery,
and to his interlocutors the

00:49:17.868 --> 00:49:21.109
truth of slavery.
It's the accent that actually

00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:24.149
reveals the truth.
So, when we hear the accent,

00:49:24.149 --> 00:49:27.460
even though we're hearing it
through the narrator that

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:32.694
doesn't speak with an accent,
we hear the critique of slavery

00:49:32.694 --> 00:49:38.953
shining through that the people
in the situation living there

00:49:38.953 --> 00:49:43.440
and listening to his accent
cannot hear,

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.860
but why?
Remember that little sentence I

00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:48.039
read at the beginning.
"If Alm Jorgensen,

00:49:48.039 --> 00:49:51.610
the murdered man,
had any heirs no one knew about

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:55.429
them."
What an odd caveat.

00:49:55.429 --> 00:50:01.751
If this narrator knows all
this, why doesn't he know about

00:50:01.751 --> 00:50:05.300
Jorgensen's heirs,
his family?

00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:07.889
So, what accounts for the
lapses in knowledge?

00:50:07.889 --> 00:50:14.800
How do we know where this
knower is situated?

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:20.036
So, I'm going to stop there,
but before you pack up,

00:50:20.036 --> 00:50:25.786
what I'd like you to think
about for next time is what it

00:50:25.786 --> 00:50:30.510
means to make something so that
it exists,

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.469
and think about that in
relation to the novel.

00:50:33.469 --> 00:50:38.013
If knowledge is this
complicated to produce,

00:50:38.013 --> 00:50:44.035
what is the status of those
things that are made with care

00:50:44.035 --> 00:50:48.789
and intention,
and made as whole objects?

00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:52.461
So think about the art forms,
the different art forms in the

00:50:52.461 --> 00:50:55.759
novel, and think about those
individual small stories,

00:50:55.759 --> 00:50:57.625
and the whole novel itself.

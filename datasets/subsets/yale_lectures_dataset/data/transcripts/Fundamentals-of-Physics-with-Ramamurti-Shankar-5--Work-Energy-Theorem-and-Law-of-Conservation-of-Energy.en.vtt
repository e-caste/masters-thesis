00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:05.287
I was going to do a brand new
topic but I didn't want to go

00:00:05.287 --> 00:00:09.254
without making sure everyone
understands the loop-the-loop

00:00:09.254 --> 00:00:11.624
problem.
Because that's one problem

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:14.751
where if you didn't learn
Newton's laws and apply them

00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:17.170
properly, you just couldn't
figure it out,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.344
okay?
All the other things we do,

00:00:19.344 --> 00:00:22.044
you know, blocks sliding down
planes, friction,

00:00:22.044 --> 00:00:25.735
pulleys,
you have an intuitive feeling

00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:31.930
for that, but this one really is
very non-intuitive right?

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.680
Here is a trolley at the top of
the track.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.721
The forces on the trolley,
both gravity and the force of

00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:42.930
the track, are both pushing
down.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.140
And the question is,
"Why isn't that falling down?"

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.820
Everything is pushing down.
Why isn't it falling down?

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.143
That's the mystery,
so what's the answer you'd give

00:00:53.143 --> 00:00:56.600
to somebody who says,
"Why isn't it falling down?"

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.463
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:02.516
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes,

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:05.883
so they might say,
"Well, if you say it's falling

00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:09.158
down, how come it doesn't end up
here to the center of the

00:01:09.158 --> 00:01:09.790
circle?"

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.870
Yes, somebody have an answer to
that, yes?

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.942
Student: [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:01:20.942 --> 00:01:24.604
Shankar: Pardon me?
Student: [inaudible]

00:01:24.604 --> 00:01:27.553
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:31.510
there are no forces in the
horizontal direction;

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.316
the forces are all--yes?
Student: [inaudible]

00:01:36.316 --> 00:01:40.340
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: It's not

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.229
negligible.
There is an acceleration that's

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.618
producing a change in velocity.
But when we say an apple has a

00:01:46.618 --> 00:01:49.431
downward acceleration,
you let it go and it falls

00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:51.015
down;
that's what we think is

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.245
downward acceleration.
Here is something which is

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.390
downward acceleration,
but it's not falling down.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.619
Yes?
Student: Force changes

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.672
the direction of velocity
vectors over time,

00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:06.336
acceleration times time,
it just changes the direction

00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:08.987
of the velocity vector.
Professor Ramamurti

00:02:08.987 --> 00:02:11.105
Shankar: Ok.
Yes, I'll take one more answer,

00:02:11.105 --> 00:02:12.915
yes?
Student: The downward

00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:16.110
component and the horizontal
component of the velocities are

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.467
independent of each other so at
the same time that the cart can

00:02:19.467 --> 00:02:22.499
be falling down it can be moving
so much in one direction

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.285
[inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:02:24.285 --> 00:02:27.333
Shankar: Alright.
So, let me summarize all the

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:29.147
different answers.
First of all,

00:02:29.147 --> 00:02:33.058
one thing you should remember,
there are no horizontal forces

00:02:33.058 --> 00:02:34.940
here.
The forces are what I've drawn;

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.650
that's why you should be very,
very careful.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.054
Just because something has a
tendency to move to the left

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:40.900
doesn't mean there's a force to
the left.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.109
That's the whole point of
Newton's law,

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.190
force is connected to
acceleration not to velocity.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.754
So yes, this will have an
acceleration,

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:52.295
you cannot avoid it.
F = ma will tell you

00:02:52.295 --> 00:02:56.633
T + mg is ma,
and the a that you want

00:02:56.633 --> 00:03:00.487
in this problem,
if it's moving in a circle,

00:03:00.487 --> 00:03:04.057
is mv^(2)/R.
So, it is accelerating,

00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:07.786
and the difference between this
one accelerating,

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:11.905
let us say--If I go to the
loop-the-loop and I drop an

00:03:11.905 --> 00:03:14.229
apple,
forget the track it's got

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:16.639
mg acting,
it's accelerating too.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.340
What's the difference between
these two?

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.730
Here, we start with zero
velocity;

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.836
you accelerate downwards.
That means you pick up a

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.269
downward velocity.
As it accelerates you keep

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.189
falling down and picking up more
and more speed.

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.262
The same acceleration's
experienced by the cart also,

00:03:32.262 --> 00:03:35.690
and a little more because
T is also pushing down.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.328
But there the change in
velocity over a tiny amount of

00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:42.898
time is not added to zero
velocity, but to this large

00:03:42.898 --> 00:03:46.959
velocity it has at that instant.
And the tiny increment in

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.583
velocity if added this way will
produce a velocity in that

00:03:50.583 --> 00:03:53.332
direction,
and what that really means if

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:57.376
you wait a small amount of time,
this thing is going along the

00:03:57.376 --> 00:04:00.767
new velocity direction.
So, that's the difference

00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:04.969
between--So, the acceleration is
the same for a falling apple as

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:08.517
for the loop-the-loop cart.
But in the apple's case,

00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:12.321
it is added to zero initial
velocity so the acceleration and

00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:15.030
the velocity are the same,
namely down.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.231
If you have a huge velocity to
which you add a tiny change in

00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:21.538
velocity, the downward direction
you rotate the velocity vector

00:04:21.538 --> 00:04:24.420
that just means that as it goes
around the circle,

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:27.105
the velocity vector is
constantly tangent to the

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:29.375
circle.
There's another way in which

00:04:29.375 --> 00:04:33.762
people understand this.
If you are on the Earth and you

00:04:33.762 --> 00:04:37.853
are standing,
say, on a building and you fire

00:04:37.853 --> 00:04:40.632
a gun,
it goes like that and it hits

00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:44.050
the ground because of
acceleration due to gravity.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.940
If you fire it a little faster
it'll go there.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.506
There'll be a certain speed at
which it keeps falling but

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:52.990
doesn't get any closer to the
center.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.540
That is in fact how you launch
a bullet into orbit.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.285
So, what's the first thing you
should do when you fire this

00:05:00.285 --> 00:05:00.570
gun?

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.182
Move away because it's going to
come back and get you from

00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:10.100
behind, okay [students
laughing].

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.449
Alright that's a very useful
lesson.

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.268
So, you might think,
"Hey I shot it in that

00:05:13.268 --> 00:05:16.281
direction, it's not my problem."
Like everything else it'll come

00:05:16.281 --> 00:05:18.420
back and get you when you least
expect it.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.459
This is how you have--;So,
is this thing falling or not?

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:27.304
It is constantly falling but
the Earth is falling under it so

00:05:27.304 --> 00:05:30.060
it's endless search to come to
the Earth.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.994
Whereas if you drop the bullet,
it'll just fall and it'll hit

00:05:32.994 --> 00:05:35.538
the ground;
that's what we always think as

00:05:35.538 --> 00:05:37.743
drop.
Okay, so this is something I

00:05:37.743 --> 00:05:40.608
did in a rush,
and I didn't want that because

00:05:40.608 --> 00:05:44.579
this is really the part of
physics which is not intuitive,

00:05:44.579 --> 00:05:47.250
and I think we all know what
the main point is.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.927
The main point is velocity is a
vector and its value can change

00:05:50.927 --> 00:05:54.130
due to change in direction,
not change in magnitude.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.281
Yes sir?
Student: That negative

00:05:57.281 --> 00:06:01.610
or that downward change in
velocity, what is that equal to?

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.504
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Okay,

00:06:03.504 --> 00:06:05.399
if you wait a certain time
Δt,

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:08.304
then the acceleration is
v^(2)/r,

00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:11.060
put the v,
put the r,

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.235
get some number,
multiply by the Δt,

00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:16.620
1/10^(th) of a second.
That'll be the change in that

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.857
time.
So, in that time also the guy

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:21.939
would have moved over in the
circle a little bit,

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:25.463
just precisely so that at that
point your new velocity vector

00:06:25.463 --> 00:06:29.482
is tangent to your new location.
So this little Δv I

00:06:29.482 --> 00:06:32.951
drew is not a fixed number;
it depends on how long you want

00:06:32.951 --> 00:06:34.517
to wait.
Calculus says wait an

00:06:34.517 --> 00:06:37.853
infinitesimal amount of time,
in practice wait 1/10^(th) of a

00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:41.140
second and it'll be fine.
Okay, today there is a very,

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.860
very important concept I want
to introduce.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.380
It's a very robust and powerful
concept;

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:47.430
it has to do with energy.

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:55.335
It is powerful because after
the laws of quantum mechanics

00:06:55.335 --> 00:06:57.603
were discovered in the sub
atomic world,

00:06:57.603 --> 00:07:00.569
we basically gave up on many
cherished notions.

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.583
You know, you must have heard
that particles cannot have a

00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:06.649
definite position and definite
velocity at a given time.

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:08.759
They don't have any
trajectories.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:11.779
You see a particle here now,
then you see it there.

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:14.710
That's true because they're
observed events.

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:17.319
What happens in between?
You might think they have a

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:20.165
trajectory but they don't.
The forces are not well defined

00:07:20.165 --> 00:07:23.536
because if you don't know where
the guy is, you don't know what

00:07:23.536 --> 00:07:25.346
the velocity is,
you don't know what the

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:27.378
acceleration is.
So most of the ideas of

00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:30.232
Newtonian mechanics are
basically surrendered,

00:07:30.232 --> 00:07:33.720
but the notion of energy turns
out to be very robust and

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.319
survives all the quantum
revolution.

00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:40.005
In fact, there is a period when
people are studying nuclear

00:07:40.005 --> 00:07:43.817
reactions and the energy you
began with didn't seem to be the

00:07:43.817 --> 00:07:48.209
energy you ended up with.
So something was missing.

00:07:48.209 --> 00:07:50.502
So Neils Bohr,
father of the atom said,

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:53.940
"Maybe the Law of Conservation
of Energy is not valid."

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.882
Then Pauli said,
"I think I put my money on the

00:07:56.882 --> 00:08:00.595
Law of Conservation of Energy.
I would postulate that some

00:08:00.595 --> 00:08:03.370
other tiny particles that you
guys cannot see,

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.329
that's carrying away all the
missing energy."

00:08:06.329 --> 00:08:09.894
That was a very radical thing
to do in those days when people

00:08:09.894 --> 00:08:12.389
did not lightly postulate new
particles.

00:08:12.389 --> 00:08:14.839
Nowadays, if you don't
postulate a particle you don't

00:08:14.839 --> 00:08:17.290
get your PhD in particle physics
[students laugh].

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.021
In those days it was very
radical, and the particle was

00:08:20.021 --> 00:08:21.640
not seen for many,
many years.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.529
It was called a neutrino.
Nowadays, neutrinos are one of

00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:26.629
the most exciting things one
could study.

00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:29.372
There's a lot of mysteries in
the universe connected with

00:08:29.372 --> 00:08:31.832
neutrinos.
Okay, so energy is a concept

00:08:31.832 --> 00:08:35.336
you're going to learn.
Here's again a place where I

00:08:35.336 --> 00:08:39.478
ask you, don't memorize the
formulas and start plugging them

00:08:39.478 --> 00:08:41.185
in.
Try to follow the logic by

00:08:41.185 --> 00:08:44.004
which you are driven to this
notion, because then it'll be

00:08:44.004 --> 00:08:46.279
less luggage for you to carry in
your head.

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:49.657
And I'll try to make the notion
as natural as possible rather

00:08:49.657 --> 00:08:52.360
than saying, "This is my
definition of energy,

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.960
this is the definition of
kinetic energy."

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.889
Let's ask where does all that
come from.

00:08:55.889 --> 00:09:00.667
How many people have seen
kinetic and potential energies

00:09:00.667 --> 00:09:03.560
in your past?
Okay, if you haven't seen it

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.515
that's fine, this is not
something you're supposed to

00:09:06.515 --> 00:09:08.483
know.
If you know it and you learned

00:09:08.483 --> 00:09:11.509
it properly it'll be helpful,
but you don't have know that.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.620
You just have to know what we
have done so far.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.610
So let's go back and ask a
simple question.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:23.100
When a force acts on a body,
what is its main effect?

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.000
What does it do?
Yes?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.620
Student: It changes its
motion.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.296
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Be more precise by

00:09:30.296 --> 00:09:31.529
it when you say "changes its
motion."

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:36.220
What does it mean to change its
motion?

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.110
Yes?
Student: It accelerates

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.401
the object [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:41.809
Shankar: Right,
that's from Newton's law;

00:09:41.809 --> 00:09:43.370
that means it changes the
velocity.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.034
So let's for a moment,
in fact for the entire lecture

00:09:47.034 --> 00:09:50.666
today, go back to one dimension.
Then, we will do the whole

00:09:50.666 --> 00:09:53.617
business in higher dimensions.
In one dimension changing the

00:09:53.617 --> 00:09:55.399
velocity simply means speeding
up.

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:58.570
So bodies are going to speed up
and forces act on them.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.294
That we know.
We're going to find the

00:10:01.294 --> 00:10:05.526
relation between how much speed
is accumulated when a force acts

00:10:05.526 --> 00:10:07.820
on a body;
we're going to derive that.

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.490
So, let us take an example
where the force is in the

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:14.730
x direction and it is
some constant.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.580
"Constant" meaning it's not
varying with time;

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.470
somebody just has to just apply
10 Newtons constantly to a body.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:29.097
What does that do?
That produces an acceleration

00:10:29.097 --> 00:10:34.500
which is F/m,
right, that's Newton's law.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.543
That's a constant acceleration.
So, let's go back to lecture

00:10:38.543 --> 00:10:41.667
number one.
Lecture number one we learned

00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:44.946
that if a body has constant
acceleration,

00:10:44.946 --> 00:10:49.701
then the velocity at the end is
the velocity squared at the

00:10:49.701 --> 00:10:55.029
beginning plus 2 times a
times the distance traveled.

00:10:55.029 --> 00:10:59.669
That's what we learned long
back, this is just kinematics.

00:10:59.669 --> 00:11:02.687
In those days we didn't ask,
"Why is it having a constant

00:11:02.687 --> 00:11:04.546
acceleration?"
You were just told,

00:11:04.546 --> 00:11:07.009
"It's a constant acceleration,
just go ahead."

00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:10.221
Now that we learned dynamics,
we know acceleration has a

00:11:10.221 --> 00:11:13.942
cause, namely a certain force.
So, I'm going to write here as

00:11:13.942 --> 00:11:17.091
you can imagine F/m in
the place of a,

00:11:17.091 --> 00:11:20.919
but I'm going to make one more
cosmetic change in notation.

00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:25.532
In all these energy formulas,
rather than calling the initial

00:11:25.532 --> 00:11:29.761
velocity or initial anything
with subscript zero and the

00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:33.361
final is no subscript,
we are going to use a notation

00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:36.509
where the final quantities are
denoted with a subscript 2,

00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:40.019
initial quantities are denoted
by a subscript 1.

00:11:40.019 --> 00:11:42.354
In other words,
initially, the body had a

00:11:42.354 --> 00:11:44.222
velocity of
v_1,

00:11:44.222 --> 00:11:47.374
and then it had an acceleration
a for a distance

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.842
d,
then the relation between final

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:52.917
initial velocities is this.
So let's put that F/m

00:11:52.917 --> 00:11:54.730
here and let's put a d.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.231
Since we are interested in the
effect of the force,

00:12:01.231 --> 00:12:04.259
we want to see what the force
did to the velocity.

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:07.706
What you find here is that if
you want to find the change in

00:12:07.706 --> 00:12:10.218
the velocity,
of course you should take this

00:12:10.218 --> 00:12:12.379
guy to the left-hand side,
right?

00:12:12.379 --> 00:12:15.444
Take it to the other side and
you want to isolate the force,

00:12:15.444 --> 00:12:17.730
so bring m/2 to the
left-hand side.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.440
So, do that in your head and
what do you get?

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.444
m/2V&lt;s
ub&gt;2^(2) -

00:12:23.444 --> 00:12:27.284
m/2v&lt;s
ub&gt;1^(2) is F

00:12:27.284 --> 00:12:28.870
times d.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:34.429
This is a very important
concept.

00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:38.080
It says, when the force acts on
a body it changes the velocity,

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.259
and it depends on how far the
force has been acting,

00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:43.230
how many meters you've been
pushing the object.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.566
It's clear that if you didn't
push it at all,

00:12:45.566 --> 00:12:48.485
then even the forces acting,
velocity hasn't had time to

00:12:48.485 --> 00:12:50.830
change.
So, it seems to depend on how

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:53.925
far the force acted,
and the change is not simply in

00:12:53.925 --> 00:12:56.110
velocity but in velocity
squared.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:01.125
That's what comes out;
then, you realize that it's the

00:13:01.125 --> 00:13:04.715
most natural thing in the world
to give this combination a name

00:13:04.715 --> 00:13:07.090
because that's what comes out of
this.

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.407
That combination is called
kinetic energy,

00:13:09.407 --> 00:13:12.120
and I'm going to call it
K_2,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.486
meaning K at the end
minus K at the beginning

00:13:16.486 --> 00:13:22.757
is F times d.
So F times d is

00:13:22.757 --> 00:13:31.495
denoted by the symbol W,
and that's called the work done

00:13:31.495 --> 00:13:34.918
by F.
That's how we introduce a

00:13:34.918 --> 00:13:38.059
notion of a force times distance
as the definition of work.

00:13:38.059 --> 00:13:41.076
This is how people--you can
say, "Why did anyone think of

00:13:41.076 --> 00:13:43.770
taking the combination F
times d?"

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.549
Well, this is how it happens.
So, you need to have a unit for

00:13:47.549 --> 00:13:51.042
this, which is actually Newton
meters, but we are tired of

00:13:51.042 --> 00:13:53.309
calling everything a Newton
meter,

00:13:53.309 --> 00:13:55.320
so we're going to call it a
joule.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.918
So joule or J,
is just a shorthand for Newton

00:13:59.918 --> 00:14:00.730
meters.

00:14:08.009 --> 00:14:17.754
Alright, so let us now write
down this following expression

00:14:17.754 --> 00:14:21.756
here.
ΔK, Δ in anything we

00:14:21.756 --> 00:14:26.922
do is the change in any
quantity, it's called delta of

00:14:26.922 --> 00:14:29.878
that quantity,
ΔK is a change in

00:14:29.878 --> 00:14:32.526
K is equal to the
F times the distance

00:14:32.526 --> 00:14:34.962
traveled.
Let the distance traveled be

00:14:34.962 --> 00:14:38.747
some tiny amount Δx.
This formula is valid even if

00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:41.840
d is 1km,
as long as force is constant.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.420
But I'm saying,
let's focus on a problem,

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:48.290
whether the force is constant
or not, over a tiny interval in

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:51.000
which the body moves the
distance Δx.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.129
Then, we find that the change
in kinetic energy is force times

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:57.851
Δx.
Now, what if there are 36

00:14:57.851 --> 00:15:01.429
forces acting on the body?
Which one should I use?

00:15:01.429 --> 00:15:04.470
I'm pulling and you're pushing
and….

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:08.625
It's got to be the net force
because Newton's law connects

00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:11.250
the net force to the
acceleration.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.815
If you and I have a tug of war
and we cancel each other out to

00:15:14.815 --> 00:15:16.919
zero then there's no
acceleration.

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:19.730
So, you've got to go back to
the definition;

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:22.404
this is very, very important.
This F better be the

00:15:22.404 --> 00:15:24.486
total force.
I should really use a subscript

00:15:24.486 --> 00:15:26.738
T for total,
but I don't want to do that and

00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:29.317
we write F = ma;
it is understood F is

00:15:29.317 --> 00:15:31.711
everything.
We'll come back later to the

00:15:31.711 --> 00:15:34.974
notion of what happens if
F is made up of two

00:15:34.974 --> 00:15:36.965
parts.
So, maybe I'll just give you a

00:15:36.965 --> 00:15:38.547
simple example.
Here's a body,

00:15:38.547 --> 00:15:42.092
right, and I'm pushing it this
way and you're pushing it that

00:15:42.092 --> 00:15:46.313
way, let's say with equal force.
And the body could be at rest

00:15:46.313 --> 00:15:50.250
or if the body had initial
velocity it'll maintain the

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:53.889
initial velocity because
velocity is for free.

00:15:53.889 --> 00:15:57.159
Then, you can ask,
"What does this theorem say?"

00:15:57.159 --> 00:15:59.080
This is called a Work Energy
Theorem.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:02.662
The Work Energy Theorem says,
"The change in energy is equal

00:16:02.662 --> 00:16:04.970
to the work done by all the
forces."

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:09.056
In this case,
there is no change in energy,

00:16:09.056 --> 00:16:13.629
but there are two forces at
work that cancel.

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:18.158
Then, it turns out that it is
sensible to define the work done

00:16:18.158 --> 00:16:21.944
by me, which is equal to
F times the distance

00:16:21.944 --> 00:16:25.708
traveled,
and the work done by you will

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:30.347
be in fact given a minus sign.
So, when do we attach a plus

00:16:30.347 --> 00:16:32.759
sign and when do we attach a
minus sign?

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:35.997
If you go back to the whole
derivation, it was understood

00:16:35.997 --> 00:16:38.310
that a was a positive
quantity.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:41.807
Then everything works.
But if the body is moving to

00:16:41.807 --> 00:16:45.353
the right, and I'm pushing to
the right, then the work done by

00:16:45.353 --> 00:16:47.772
me is positive.
And if you were pushing to the

00:16:47.772 --> 00:16:50.653
left and the body still moved to
the right, the work done by you

00:16:50.653 --> 00:16:52.129
is negative.
In other words,

00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:54.603
if you get your way,
namely, things move the way

00:16:54.603 --> 00:16:56.603
you're pushing,
the work done by you is

00:16:56.603 --> 00:16:58.700
positive.
If people are pushing you

00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:01.366
counter to your will,
in the opposite direction to

00:17:01.366 --> 00:17:03.760
your force, work done by you is
negative.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.199
See, here is a simple example.
I have a piece of chalk and I'm

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:10.440
lifting it at constant velocity
from the ground.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:13.099
Its kinetic energy is not
changing.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.664
That means the total work done
on it is zero,

00:17:15.664 --> 00:17:18.519
but it's not because there are
no forces on it.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:22.074
There is gravity acting down
and there is me countering

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:25.958
gravity with exactly the right
amount I'm applying the force

00:17:25.958 --> 00:17:28.646
mg.
So, work done by me would be

00:17:28.646 --> 00:17:31.990
positive because I want it to go
up, and it goes up.

00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:34.704
So, if it goes up by an amount
h work done by me is

00:17:34.704 --> 00:17:37.798
mg times h.
Work done by gravity in the

00:17:37.798 --> 00:17:41.483
meantime is minus mg
times h, so the total

00:17:41.483 --> 00:17:45.562
work done is zero.
So, this formula says this is

00:17:45.562 --> 00:17:49.894
the total force,
but I'm telling you if you take

00:17:49.894 --> 00:17:55.055
the work done and call it
ΔW it maybe a result of

00:17:55.055 --> 00:17:57.221
many works,
work done by me,

00:17:57.221 --> 00:17:58.992
work done you,
work done by somebody else,

00:17:58.992 --> 00:18:00.804
some are positive,
some are negative,

00:18:00.804 --> 00:18:03.943
you add them all up.
So, that is the notion of work

00:18:03.943 --> 00:18:07.069
done by one of many forces
acting on a body.

00:18:07.069 --> 00:18:10.954
And the total work done is the
algebraic sum of the work done

00:18:10.954 --> 00:18:13.756
by all the forces.
Alright, so we've got this

00:18:13.756 --> 00:18:15.450
result;
let's do the following.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.369
Let us imagine all of this
occurs in a time Δt.

00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:24.767
Then ΔK/Δt,
which will eventually become

00:18:24.767 --> 00:18:30.852
dK/dt if you take all the
proper limits becomes F

00:18:30.852 --> 00:18:35.483
times dx/dt,
which is force times velocity

00:18:35.483 --> 00:18:40.714
and that's called power.
So, power is the rate at which

00:18:40.714 --> 00:18:43.411
work is done.
For example,

00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:48.660
if I climb a 12-story building
I've done some work;

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.894
my m times g
times the height of the

00:18:51.894 --> 00:18:53.811
building.
I can climb the building in one

00:18:53.811 --> 00:18:55.579
minute, I can climb the building
in one hour,

00:18:55.579 --> 00:18:58.410
the work done is the same,
but the power is a measure of

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:01.569
how rapidly work is done.
That's why it's the product of

00:19:01.569 --> 00:19:04.281
force and velocity.
So, the units for power are

00:19:04.281 --> 00:19:07.845
joules per second;
now, that also has a new name,

00:19:07.845 --> 00:19:10.579
which is watts or just
W.

00:19:10.579 --> 00:19:13.557
You may use a kilowatt,
which is kW,

00:19:13.557 --> 00:19:16.109
little k then W is thousand
watts.

00:19:16.109 --> 00:19:20.639
So, if you've got a 60-watt
bulb, it's consuming energy at

00:19:20.639 --> 00:19:23.420
the rate of 60 joules per
second.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.400
That's the meaning of a 60-watt
bulb.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.561
Okay, now I'm going to do the
next generalization,

00:19:30.561 --> 00:19:36.460
which is when the force is not
a constant but varies with

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.830
x.

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:47.030
So, do we know any example of a
force that varies with location?

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:48.499
Student: A spring.
Professor Ramamurti

00:19:48.499 --> 00:19:49.500
Shankar: A spring is one
example.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.024
Even gravity I think we know is
not a secret,

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:54.950
the force of gravity is
mg near the Earth,

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.920
but if you go sufficiently far
you will notice gravity itself

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.783
is getting weaker.
It'll still look like mg

00:20:00.783 --> 00:20:04.046
but g won't be 9.8,
g will become 9.6 and

00:20:04.046 --> 00:20:07.949
9.2 and 9.1, it'll decrease.
But the variation of gravity in

00:20:07.949 --> 00:20:11.614
terrestrial experiments is
pretty small so we won't worry

00:20:11.614 --> 00:20:13.861
about it.
But the force of a spring

00:20:13.861 --> 00:20:16.960
definitely varies with x
in a noticeable way.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.880
The force of a spring is one
concrete example;

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.450
it's what you all seem to
recognize;

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.865
it's this one [(-kx)].
So then, we have to ask what is

00:20:26.865 --> 00:20:30.309
the Work Energy Theorem when the
forces itself vary?

00:20:30.309 --> 00:20:34.640
So, let's draw ourselves a
force which is varying,

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.910
here is x,
here is my force;

00:20:37.910 --> 00:20:41.523
it does something.
F = kx or –kx

00:20:41.523 --> 00:20:45.513
is a particular graph,
I'm just taking any function of

00:20:45.513 --> 00:20:49.457
x that I want.
Now, the acceleration is not

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:52.970
constant because the force is
not a constant.

00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:56.084
So, if you wait for one hour
the change in kinetic energy is

00:20:56.084 --> 00:20:59.409
not simply force times distance
because what force are you going

00:20:59.409 --> 00:21:00.837
to use?
It was something now,

00:21:00.837 --> 00:21:02.330
it is something later,
it is positive,

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.601
now it's negative later.
So, we cannot apply this

00:21:05.601 --> 00:21:09.599
formula because F is not
a constant.

00:21:09.599 --> 00:21:14.929
So, the usual trick in calculus
is find me an interval in

00:21:14.929 --> 00:21:19.783
x, which is so narrow,
and I'll make it as narrow as

00:21:19.783 --> 00:21:23.853
you insist, so that during that
period I'll think that F

00:21:23.853 --> 00:21:27.725
is a constant and the constant
value of F is just the

00:21:27.725 --> 00:21:30.220
function F at that time
x,

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.180
at that time where the location
is x.

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:38.500
So, for that tiny interval I
can still say that F is

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.436
constant;
F over m is some

00:21:41.436 --> 00:21:45.160
constant over the tiny interval,
then the change in kinetic

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.500
energy will be then F(x)
times Δx.

00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:52.331
Then, you wait a little longer,
you go to a new place,

00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:57.029
then you've got a new value of
the force, maybe somewhere here.

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:59.750
Then, that times Δx is
the work done in that region.

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:03.045
But geometrically,
F(x) times Δx is

00:22:03.045 --> 00:22:07.080
the area of the little rectangle
whose base is Δx and

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.779
whose height is the function
F at that time.

00:22:10.779 --> 00:22:13.464
So, if you eventually went from
here to here [distance on

00:22:13.464 --> 00:22:16.389
graph], let me call that point
as x_1 and let

00:22:16.389 --> 00:22:18.930
me call the ending point as
x_2,

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:23.112
then the work done by you is
really given by the area under

00:22:23.112 --> 00:22:26.466
that graph.
And in every segment you pick

00:22:26.466 --> 00:22:30.799
up the change in kinetic energy,
you add it all up.

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:33.655
When we say add it all up on
the left-hand side,

00:22:33.655 --> 00:22:37.119
all the ΔKs will add up
to give me the final minus

00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:40.706
initial kinetic energy.
This one is what is written in

00:22:40.706 --> 00:22:43.625
the notation of calculus as
F(x)dx from

00:22:43.625 --> 00:22:46.740
x_1 to
x_2.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:52.339
This is called the integral of
the function F(x).

00:22:52.339 --> 00:22:56.951
Now again, in a course at this
level I'm assuming that you guys

00:22:56.951 --> 00:23:00.557
know what an integral is.
Even if you've never heard of

00:23:00.557 --> 00:23:03.806
an integral, if I give you a
function and you never heard of

00:23:03.806 --> 00:23:06.559
calculus, you can still deal
with this problem.

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.839
Because you'll come to me and
say, "Give me your function."

00:23:08.839 --> 00:23:13.099
I'm going to plot it in some
kind of graph paper with a grid

00:23:13.099 --> 00:23:17.430
on it, and I'm just going to
count the number of tiny squares

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.053
enclosed here.
That's the area and that's the

00:23:20.053 --> 00:23:22.860
change in kinetic energy.
So, integration is finding the

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.849
area under graphs bounded by the
function of the top,

00:23:25.849 --> 00:23:28.281
x axis below,
and two vertical lines at the

00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:29.720
starting and ending points.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.661
Now, a little digression.
Even though you're supposed to

00:23:37.661 --> 00:23:41.453
know this, I want to make
sure--part of my "No Child Left

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:44.500
Behind" program,
that you all follow this.

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:48.109
If you never heard calculus or
integral calculus this is going

00:23:48.109 --> 00:23:50.950
to be a two-minute,
three-minute introduction.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.748
There is a great secret,
which is that if you give me a

00:23:53.748 --> 00:23:56.650
function and you tell me to find
the area under this from

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.190
x_1 to
x_2,

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:03.697
I can go to the graph paper and
draw that, or there is quite

00:24:03.697 --> 00:24:06.816
often a trick.
You don't have to draw

00:24:06.816 --> 00:24:09.643
anything, you know.
And I will tell you a little

00:24:09.643 --> 00:24:12.119
more about what it is.
If you give me a function

00:24:12.119 --> 00:24:15.573
F(x), the area under this
graph happens to be the

00:24:15.573 --> 00:24:18.009
following.
There is another function

00:24:18.009 --> 00:24:21.119
G(x) that will be
specified in a moment.

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:25.768
And you just have to find
G at the upper limit

00:24:25.768 --> 00:24:30.595
minus G at the lower
limit, and that will be the

00:24:30.595 --> 00:24:33.355
area.
And who is this mystery

00:24:33.355 --> 00:24:36.753
function G?
It is any function whose

00:24:36.753 --> 00:24:39.950
derivative is the given function
F.

00:24:44.829 --> 00:24:47.600
So, the whole business of
finding area which was solved

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:50.488
around Newton's time,
is if you have a function they

00:24:50.488 --> 00:24:53.507
want the area under it,
you go and think of a function

00:24:53.507 --> 00:24:55.900
whose derivative is the given
function.

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.950
So, it is the opposite of
taking derivatives.

00:24:57.950 --> 00:25:00.559
Differentiation is an
algorithmic process;

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:02.412
you take F(x),
you add a Δx to the

00:25:02.412 --> 00:25:04.920
x, you find the change in
F divide by Δx.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.770
Given any function you can do
that.

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:09.429
This is the opposite;
this is guessing the function

00:25:09.429 --> 00:25:11.619
G whose derivative is
F.

00:25:11.619 --> 00:25:15.692
So, if I say F(x) equals
x^(3),

00:25:15.692 --> 00:25:20.506
then G(x) is that
function whose derivative is

00:25:20.506 --> 00:25:23.408
x^(3).
So, I know I've got to start

00:25:23.408 --> 00:25:26.161
with x to the 4^(th)
because when I take derivatives

00:25:26.161 --> 00:25:28.960
it'll become an x^(3),
but with the 4 in it.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.693
So, I fight that by putting a 4
downstairs and that's the

00:25:31.693 --> 00:25:33.539
function G.
Yes?

00:25:33.539 --> 00:25:36.970
Student: Shouldn't there
be a c?

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.035
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes,

00:25:38.035 --> 00:25:40.377
that is the plus c.
The c is,

00:25:40.377 --> 00:25:45.009
of course, velocity of light
[students laugh].

00:25:45.009 --> 00:25:46.720
Now, why is this plus c
there?

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.604
She's quite right,
because if you've got a

00:25:48.604 --> 00:25:51.177
function whose derivative is
something, adding a constant

00:25:51.177 --> 00:25:53.570
doesn't change the derivative.
Then you can say,

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.453
"Well, we are in trouble now
because you told me to find the

00:25:56.453 --> 00:25:58.804
function G,
and you're telling me the world

00:25:58.804 --> 00:26:01.539
cannot agree on what G is
because I've got one G,

00:26:01.539 --> 00:26:04.190
you've got another one with a
different constant."

00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.199
But the beauty is that when you
take this difference,

00:26:07.199 --> 00:26:10.440
I may not put the constant,
and you may put the constant,

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.967
but it's going to cancel out.
So, most of the time,

00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:16.970
people don't bother with the
constant.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.420
Sometimes it's very important
to keep the constant in place --

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.710
it plays a special role -- but
we don't want that here.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:23.010
We'll just call this the
integral.

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:30.668
So, maybe it's again worth
asking for a second,

00:26:30.668 --> 00:26:32.779
why is this true,
you know.

00:26:32.779 --> 00:26:36.049
Why is G the function
whose derivative is F?

00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:37.789
Why is that the answer to the
problem?

00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:40.866
Well, one way to think about
it, this is really more for your

00:26:40.866 --> 00:26:44.187
completeness than anything else.
Suppose there is a function

00:26:44.187 --> 00:26:47.633
F, and I'm finding the
area, let me find it up to the

00:26:47.633 --> 00:26:50.730
point that I'm going to call
x_2.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.200
For the starting point let me
just pick zero.

00:26:55.859 --> 00:27:00.469
This is the area I'm looking
for, and I write it as

00:27:00.469 --> 00:27:06.000
F(x)dx from zero to the
point x_2.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.477
You agree that as I slide
x_2 back and

00:27:08.477 --> 00:27:11.000
forth, the area is varying with
x_2,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.239
so it's legitimate to call that
a function of

00:27:13.239 --> 00:27:14.410
x_2.

00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:20.487
A function is anything that
depends on something else,

00:27:20.487 --> 00:27:22.759
and we all agree that if the
point actually moves,

00:27:22.759 --> 00:27:25.196
the area moves.
This is my shorthand for the

00:27:25.196 --> 00:27:27.029
area.
The starting point is nailed at

00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:28.970
zero;
this is G(x_2).

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:34.430
The left asks what is
G(x_2+Δ).

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:39.594
That is the area to this point,
that we denoted as

00:27:39.594 --> 00:27:45.074
F(x)dx from zero to
x_2 + Δ,

00:27:45.074 --> 00:27:49.079
that's
G(x_2+Δ).

00:27:49.079 --> 00:27:51.420
So, what is the difference
between the two?

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:57.176
The difference between the two
is G(x_2 + Δ) -

00:27:57.176 --> 00:28:01.700
G(x_2).
If you look at that graph,

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:06.964
the extra area that I have is
this thing, and that is clearly

00:28:06.964 --> 00:28:11.876
equal to F at the point
x_2 times

00:28:11.876 --> 00:28:14.312
Δx.
In other words,

00:28:14.312 --> 00:28:18.100
by how much is the area
changing when I change the upper

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:19.858
limit?
Well, it's changing by the

00:28:19.858 --> 00:28:22.266
height of the function at the
very last moment times the

00:28:22.266 --> 00:28:25.642
change in x.
Well, we know what to do now,

00:28:25.642 --> 00:28:30.634
divide by Δx and take
the limit, and you can see that

00:28:30.634 --> 00:28:34.876
F(x_2) is
dG/dx at the point

00:28:34.876 --> 00:28:37.618
x_2.
But the point

00:28:37.618 --> 00:28:39.799
x_2 is whatever
point you want.

00:28:39.799 --> 00:28:42.403
So, we drop the label,
and we just say that F

00:28:42.403 --> 00:28:44.650
as a function of x is
dG/dx.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.408
This is the origin of the
result that the area can be

00:28:47.408 --> 00:28:50.060
found if you can find the
inverse derivative of the

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.535
function.
So, let's keep a couple of

00:28:53.535 --> 00:28:58.704
popular examples in mind.
One, if F(x) equals the

00:28:58.704 --> 00:29:03.156
constant, then the G(x)
is equal to constant times

00:29:03.156 --> 00:29:06.923
x.
If F(x) = x then,

00:29:06.923 --> 00:29:12.200
G(x) is equal to
x^(2) over 2.

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.306
As you know,
the integral of x^(n) is x^(n)

00:29:15.306 --> 00:29:17.644
+1 over n + 1.
There are integrals for all

00:29:17.644 --> 00:29:19.654
kinds of functions,
and you check them by taking

00:29:19.654 --> 00:29:22.049
derivatives and make sure you
get back your F.

00:29:22.049 --> 00:29:25.319
Alright, suppose this is what
we learned from the math guys,

00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:28.809
then go back to the Work Energy
Theorem and see what it says,

00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:31.569
K_2-K
_1.

00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:35.790
Oh, by the way,
I didn't complete one story;

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:38.456
let me finish that.
This was, if

00:29:38.456 --> 00:29:41.726
G(x_2) was the
area from zero to the point

00:29:41.726 --> 00:29:45.003
x_2,
G(x_1) is the

00:29:45.003 --> 00:29:48.210
area from zero to the point
x_1.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:52.118
That is perhaps clear to you,
if I only wanted the area

00:29:52.118 --> 00:29:55.376
between the point
x_1 and the

00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:58.926
point x_2,
I can take the area all the way

00:29:58.926 --> 00:30:01.287
up to x_2,
subtract from it the area all

00:30:01.287 --> 00:30:02.890
the way up to
x_1,

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:08.299
and that's of course the claim
that this integral F(x)dx

00:30:08.299 --> 00:30:12.749
from x_1 to
x_2 is

00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:16.850
G(x_2) -
G(x_1).

00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:25.612
That's the reason the integral
is given by a difference of this

00:30:25.612 --> 00:30:27.510
G.
So, let me use a shorthand

00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:29.447
notation and call
G(x_2) as

00:30:29.447 --> 00:30:31.879
simply G_2,
G(x_1) is

00:30:31.879 --> 00:30:34.053
G_1.
You should understand,

00:30:34.053 --> 00:30:36.653
G_2 means
G evaluated at the final

00:30:36.653 --> 00:30:39.208
point, G_1 to
G evaluated initial

00:30:39.208 --> 00:30:40.504
point.
So, you have got

00:30:40.504 --> 00:30:42.391
K_2 -
K_1 is

00:30:42.391 --> 00:30:44.179
G_2 -
G_1,

00:30:44.179 --> 00:30:46.960
but G is some definite
function of x.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.871
You've got to understand that.
For example,

00:30:48.871 --> 00:30:51.397
it could be
x_2^(2) over 2

00:30:51.397 --> 00:30:55.126
- x_1^(2) over
2 in the problem where F

00:30:55.126 --> 00:30:58.917
is equal to x.
Then, let's rearrange this

00:30:58.917 --> 00:31:04.143
thing to read K_2 -
G_2 is equal to

00:31:04.143 --> 00:31:07.570
K_1 -
G_1.

00:31:12.869 --> 00:31:17.295
So, the Work Energy Theorem
says that, "If a force is acting

00:31:17.295 --> 00:31:21.720
on a body, a variable force
associated with the force is the

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:24.542
function G,
a variable function of

00:31:24.542 --> 00:31:27.099
x, whose derivative is
the given force."

00:31:27.099 --> 00:31:29.513
Then, at the beginning,
if you take the difference of

00:31:29.513 --> 00:31:32.019
kinetic energy minus the value
of G_2,

00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:34.373
it'll be the same.
I'm sorry, K_1 -

00:31:34.373 --> 00:31:36.120
G_1,
it'll be the same as

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.960
K_2 -
G_2.

00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:41.839
Now, we don't like the form in
which this is written.

00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:45.029
We have to make a little
cosmetic change,

00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:49.095
and the cosmetic change is to
introduce the function

00:31:49.095 --> 00:31:53.720
U(x), which is minus this
function G(x).

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.925
So, once you do that,
you've got to remember now the

00:31:56.925 --> 00:32:00.569
force is equal to minus the
derivative of this function,

00:32:00.569 --> 00:32:05.430
because of the minus sign
relating G to U.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:10.672
Then, we can write it as
K_2 + U_2

00:32:10.672 --> 00:32:14.230
= K_1 +
U_1.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:16.872
And that combination,
if you call that as

00:32:16.872 --> 00:32:20.308
E_2 and you
call this combination as

00:32:20.308 --> 00:32:22.621
E_1,
we are saying,

00:32:22.621 --> 00:32:24.322
E_1 =
E_2,

00:32:24.322 --> 00:32:26.590
and that's called the
Conservation of Energy.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:36.987
So, what does conservation mean?
Conservation of Energy in

00:32:36.987 --> 00:32:39.718
physics has a totally different
meaning from conservation of

00:32:39.718 --> 00:32:41.813
energy in daily life.
Here it means,

00:32:41.813 --> 00:32:45.326
when a body's moving under the
effect of this force

00:32:45.326 --> 00:32:48.415
F(x),
you agree it's gaining speed or

00:32:48.415 --> 00:32:51.240
losing speed or doing all kinds
of things.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.856
So, as it moves around it's
speeding up and slowing down,

00:32:54.856 --> 00:32:57.440
so its speed is definitely a
variable,

00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:02.144
but a certain magic combination
connected to the velocity of the

00:33:02.144 --> 00:33:06.002
object and to its location,
U depends on x,

00:33:06.002 --> 00:33:09.541
that does not change with time.
And it's very useful to know

00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:13.124
that does not change with time,
because if you knew the value

00:33:13.124 --> 00:33:15.592
of E,
even if E were to equal

00:33:15.592 --> 00:33:18.631
some fixed number E at
one time you know E at

00:33:18.631 --> 00:33:21.710
all of the times.
So, let's take a simple example.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.330
So, we take a rock and we drop
it.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:29.349
We know it's picking up speed;
we know it's losing height.

00:33:29.349 --> 00:33:32.951
So, you may think maybe there
is some combination of height

00:33:32.951 --> 00:33:36.180
and speed, which does not change
in this exchange,

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.990
and we find the combination by
this rule now.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:43.369
In the case of gravity,
F = -mg;

00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:47.383
therefore, U = mg times
y, because

00:33:47.383 --> 00:33:50.970
–du/dy will now be my
F.

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:56.384
Then, we may conclude that
½mv^(2) + mgy at

00:33:56.384 --> 00:34:02.275
the initial time will be equal
to ½mv_2^(2) +

00:34:02.275 --> 00:34:06.550
mgy_2 at the
final time.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:17.269
And that is the--And the whole
thing can be evaluated any time.

00:34:17.269 --> 00:34:19.389
You take any random time you
want.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:21.719
The sum of these two numbers
doesn't change.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.139
And that's a very,
very powerful result.

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:27.454
So, I'm going to give you one
more example later when you can

00:34:27.454 --> 00:34:30.324
see the power of this.
But in the case of gravity,

00:34:30.324 --> 00:34:33.467
this is what it means.
So, this agrees with the

00:34:33.467 --> 00:34:37.960
intuitive notion that when you
lose height you gain speed,

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.110
when you lower your y
you gain speed,

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:42.059
but it's much more precise than
that.

00:34:42.059 --> 00:34:44.522
Instead of saying vaguely,
"you lose and gain,"

00:34:44.522 --> 00:34:47.465
½mv^(2) is the part
connected with the speed and

00:34:47.465 --> 00:34:50.677
mgy is the part connected
with the height and that sum

00:34:50.677 --> 00:34:54.957
does not change with time.
So, let's go back to the mass

00:34:54.957 --> 00:34:58.742
and spring system.
In the case of the mass and

00:34:58.742 --> 00:35:02.245
spring system,
if you have a mass connected to

00:35:02.245 --> 00:35:05.015
a spring,
then we say here

00:35:05.015 --> 00:35:09.717
½mv^(2) +
½kx^(2) equal to

00:35:09.717 --> 00:35:14.426
E is a constant.
That means, find it at any

00:35:14.426 --> 00:35:17.547
initial time one,
find it at any final time two,

00:35:17.547 --> 00:35:21.000
add these two numbers,
the total will not change.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:31.993
So, let me put that to work.
Let me use that in a

00:35:31.993 --> 00:35:37.300
calculation.
So, I say here is a spring;

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:43.177
here is where it likes to be.
I'm going to pull it to a new

00:35:43.177 --> 00:35:45.916
location a.
x = 0 is where the

00:35:45.916 --> 00:35:48.655
spring likes to be.
I'm going to pull it by an

00:35:48.655 --> 00:35:51.110
amount A and I'm going to let it
go.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:54.441
And I want to know how fast the
guy is moving when it comes back

00:35:54.441 --> 00:35:55.710
to, say, x = 0.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.851
If you go back to Newton's
laws, it's a pretty complicated

00:36:01.851 --> 00:36:03.999
problem.
You have got to think about why

00:36:03.999 --> 00:36:07.328
it's a complicated problem.
Because you start with a mass

00:36:07.328 --> 00:36:10.182
at rest, if you pull it by an
amount A,

00:36:10.182 --> 00:36:13.352
a force acting on it,
it would be –k times

00:36:13.352 --> 00:36:15.718
A;
that will produce a tiny

00:36:15.718 --> 00:36:18.306
acceleration,
will produce an acceleration,

00:36:18.306 --> 00:36:20.955
right, kA/m,
which will give it a new

00:36:20.955 --> 00:36:23.420
velocity by the time it comes
here.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.993
But once it comes to the new
location, a little later,

00:36:26.993 --> 00:36:29.420
a different force is acting on
it.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.374
Because the x is now
different, so the acceleration

00:36:32.374 --> 00:36:34.239
during this interval is
different,

00:36:34.239 --> 00:36:36.288
and the gain and the velocity
of that interval will be

00:36:36.288 --> 00:36:37.989
different from that in the first
interval.

00:36:37.989 --> 00:36:41.050
You've got to add all these
changes to find the velocity

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:43.407
here.
That's a difficult proposition,

00:36:43.407 --> 00:36:46.643
but with the Law of
Conservation of Energy you'll do

00:36:46.643 --> 00:36:50.062
that in one second.
In fact, let's do it not just

00:36:50.062 --> 00:36:53.757
to be at the mid point here,
but at any point x

00:36:53.757 --> 00:36:59.057
measured from equilibrium.
Because we will say initially

00:36:59.057 --> 00:37:05.387
½mv_1^(2) +
½kx_1² =

00:37:05.387 --> 00:37:12.170
½m v_2^(2) +
½kx_2².

00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:14.957
This is the truth;
this is a constant that does

00:37:14.957 --> 00:37:17.704
not change with time.
Now, to get some mileage out of

00:37:17.704 --> 00:37:20.550
this, you've got to know what
the constant value is.

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:24.494
Well, we know what it is in the
beginning because when you pull

00:37:24.494 --> 00:37:27.929
this guy, at the instant we knew
it had no velocity,

00:37:27.929 --> 00:37:31.203
and we knew it was sitting at
the point A,

00:37:31.203 --> 00:37:34.545
so we know ½k
A_1² is the total

00:37:34.545 --> 00:37:37.409
energy of this mass and spring
system.

00:37:37.409 --> 00:37:40.119
That's not going to change with
time.

00:37:40.119 --> 00:37:43.390
We like to say that at the
initial time all the energy is

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:46.059
potential energy;
there is no kinetic energy

00:37:46.059 --> 00:37:49.563
because there is no motion.
At any subsequent time,

00:37:49.563 --> 00:37:53.130
this number has to be equal to
what you get.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:55.110
Now, let me drop the subscript
to there [pointing to equation].

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.010
Let it stand for some generic
instant in the future.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:02.396
This much we know.
Now, do you see that we can

00:38:02.396 --> 00:38:06.800
solve for the velocity on any
location x?

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.215
You pick the x;
if you want x to be zero

00:38:09.215 --> 00:38:10.906
that's very easy,
you kill that term,

00:38:10.906 --> 00:38:13.966
you balance these two,
you cancel the half and you can

00:38:13.966 --> 00:38:16.340
see that's a formula for
v^(2).

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:20.159
v^(2) is going to be
ka^(2) over m;

00:38:20.159 --> 00:38:24.986
that is going to be the
velocity when it swings by this

00:38:24.986 --> 00:38:27.729
midpoint.
But you can pick any x

00:38:27.729 --> 00:38:30.579
you like, if the x was
not zero but .1;

00:38:30.579 --> 00:38:33.188
well, put the .1,
take it to the other side and

00:38:33.188 --> 00:38:36.732
solve for v.
This is one example of the Law

00:38:36.732 --> 00:38:39.882
of Conservation of Energy.
So, the power of the Law of

00:38:39.882 --> 00:38:42.099
Conservation of Energy is if you
knew the initial energy,

00:38:42.099 --> 00:38:44.591
you don't have to go through
Newton's laws,

00:38:44.591 --> 00:38:48.150
and you'll find it in all the
problem sets and many exams.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.177
When a problem is given to you
and you are told to find the

00:38:51.177 --> 00:38:53.799
velocity of something,
you should try whenever

00:38:53.799 --> 00:38:57.074
possible to use the Law of
Conservation of Energy rather

00:38:57.074 --> 00:39:00.908
than going to Newton's laws.
So, if you want to know what

00:39:00.908 --> 00:39:03.891
have we done,
how come finding the velocity

00:39:03.891 --> 00:39:08.010
seemed so difficult when I
described it to you earlier,

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:09.909
and would we have done it,
the answer is,

00:39:09.909 --> 00:39:12.472
if you tell me the force of the
spring is a function of

00:39:12.472 --> 00:39:15.353
x,
I have done that integral in

00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:18.829
the Work Energy Theorem,
once and for all.

00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:21.827
The integral of the spring
force has been integrated once

00:39:21.827 --> 00:39:25.039
and for all and that's what the
potential energy is doing.

00:39:25.039 --> 00:39:28.550
The potential energy comes from
integrating that force.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:34.142
Alright, so now lets take
another problem where there are

00:39:34.142 --> 00:39:36.670
two forces acting.
Yes?

00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:39.879
Student: Could you
explain really quick how you got

00:39:39.879 --> 00:39:42.920
the ½ in front of the
kx^(2) for the energy?

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.866
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Let me see,

00:39:43.866 --> 00:39:45.108
here?
Student: No,

00:39:45.108 --> 00:39:47.420
down at the bottom of the
center, yeah.

00:39:47.420 --> 00:39:48.329
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Here?

00:39:48.329 --> 00:39:50.159
Student: Is it just
because of the integration?

00:39:50.159 --> 00:39:51.833
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yeah,

00:39:51.833 --> 00:39:53.340
for a spring I think we said
here,

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:59.469
if the force is x,
the potential energy is G =

00:39:59.469 --> 00:40:01.859
x^(2)/2,
U will be

00:40:01.859 --> 00:40:05.451
-x^(2)/2.
So, the force is –kx,

00:40:05.451 --> 00:40:10.602
then you have to find the
U so that –du/dx

00:40:10.602 --> 00:40:15.212
= –kx and the answer to
that is U is

00:40:15.212 --> 00:40:18.736
kx^(2)/2.
So, if you knew the force,

00:40:18.736 --> 00:40:21.551
you just find the function
U by asking,

00:40:21.551 --> 00:40:25.180
"Whose derivative gives me
F with a minus sign?"

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.828
Then you are done.
That's the potential energy for

00:40:28.828 --> 00:40:32.488
that problem.
Now, lets take another problem,

00:40:32.488 --> 00:40:35.250
a mass is hanging from the
ceiling.

00:40:35.250 --> 00:40:38.426
Then, it's got two kinds of
potential energy,

00:40:38.426 --> 00:40:41.820
one is just a gravitational
potential energy,

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.237
and the other is a spring
potential energy,

00:40:44.237 --> 00:40:47.116
and that's going to come
because K_2 -

00:40:47.116 --> 00:40:50.570
K_1 will be the
integral of F(x)dx.

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:53.255
I'm sorry, let's call it
dy and F(y)dy from

00:40:53.255 --> 00:40:55.510
y_1 to
y_2.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:59.756
And this F(y) will have
two parts, the force of gravity

00:40:59.756 --> 00:41:02.889
-- I'm tired of writing the
limits -- then,

00:41:02.889 --> 00:41:08.414
the force of the spring,
from 1 to 2 [adding the limits

00:41:08.414 --> 00:41:11.684
to the integrals].
Right, there are two forces

00:41:11.684 --> 00:41:14.693
acting on it.
This one will be

00:41:14.693 --> 00:41:20.628
mgy_2 -
mgy_1,

00:41:20.628 --> 00:41:27.304
this one will be
½ky_2^(2) -

00:41:27.304 --> 00:41:34.086
½ky_1^(2).
So, every force acting on the

00:41:34.086 --> 00:41:37.340
body will turn into a potential
energy, because the

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.113
force--Newton's law says Work
Energy Theorem applies to the

00:41:41.113 --> 00:41:43.643
total force.
So, the total force is two

00:41:43.643 --> 00:41:45.670
parts, and you can do two
integrals;

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:48.774
each integral is an upper limit
minus lower limit of some

00:41:48.774 --> 00:41:51.989
function and this is what you
get [pointing to formula].

00:41:51.989 --> 00:41:54.570
Oh, I think I made one mistake
here.

00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:03.847
I think this should give me,
yes, this overall sign is wrong

00:42:03.847 --> 00:42:07.811
in these equations.
Really, there's a minus in that

00:42:07.811 --> 00:42:10.897
and minus in that.
In other words,

00:42:10.897 --> 00:42:16.850
the work done by the force,
if there's only one force

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:21.429
acting, is really U(1) -
(U2).

00:42:21.429 --> 00:42:23.579
You see why I got the sign
wrong?

00:42:23.579 --> 00:42:26.055
When you do the integral in
calculus, integral of F

00:42:26.055 --> 00:42:27.880
is G_2 -
G_1,

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.300
but G and U are
minuses of each other.

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:33.668
So, integral of force will give
U initially -U

00:42:33.668 --> 00:42:35.815
finally.
So, it should really be +

00:42:35.815 --> 00:42:38.010
mgy_1 -
mgy_2.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:44.528
So, the Law of Conservation of
Energy for this object will be

00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:50.721
that, ½mv^(2) + mgy +
½ky^(2) is the total

00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:56.303
energy and will not change.
So, this mass can bump up and

00:42:56.303 --> 00:42:59.987
down and go back and forth.
If you knew the total of these

00:42:59.987 --> 00:43:03.082
three numbers at one instant,
you know the value at any other

00:43:03.082 --> 00:43:04.430
instant.
For example,

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:07.943
if you pulled it from its
equilibrium by .2 centimeters

00:43:07.943 --> 00:43:11.070
and you released it,
and you say what's the speed

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:14.622
when it's .1 centimeters away,
it's very easy because you know

00:43:14.622 --> 00:43:17.941
the initial energy was all
spring energy and gravitational

00:43:17.941 --> 00:43:20.092
energy.
At any later time if you knew

00:43:20.092 --> 00:43:21.996
the y,
if you knew the position,

00:43:21.996 --> 00:43:24.510
you know the potential energy;
that's the whole point.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:26.389
Potential energy depends on
where you are;

00:43:26.389 --> 00:43:29.110
kinetic energy depends on how
fast you're moving.

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:32.246
And some combination of where
you are and how fast you're

00:43:32.246 --> 00:43:34.989
moving is invariant,
does not change with time.

00:43:34.989 --> 00:43:37.879
So, if you tell me where you
are, I will tell you how fast

00:43:37.879 --> 00:43:40.610
you're moving.
By the way, remember the

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:43.730
kinetic energy enters as
v^(2).

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:45.721
You can imagine,
when you solve for v

00:43:45.721 --> 00:43:47.620
you're always going to get two
answers.

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:52.470
Why is that?
Does it make any sense?

00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:54.802
Yes?
Student: Because you're

00:43:54.802 --> 00:43:57.655
going to have the same potential
energy [Inaudible]

00:43:57.655 --> 00:43:59.938
problem if you're oscillating
[inaudible]

00:43:59.938 --> 00:44:02.449
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Or,

00:44:02.449 --> 00:44:05.649
if a spring is going back and
forth at a given point x,

00:44:05.649 --> 00:44:08.691
you can have two velocities
because you could be going away

00:44:08.691 --> 00:44:11.765
from the center,
or it can be going back towards

00:44:11.765 --> 00:44:14.697
the center.
So, this tells you the velocity

00:44:14.697 --> 00:44:17.746
on those two will be related by
a minus sign,

00:44:17.746 --> 00:44:19.432
right?
If you pull the spring this

00:44:19.432 --> 00:44:21.125
way, when you go through the
origin you say,

00:44:21.125 --> 00:44:23.491
"What's my velocity?"
I'll get two answers because I

00:44:23.491 --> 00:44:26.429
could be going to the origin or
I could go the other way and on

00:44:26.429 --> 00:44:28.230
the way back again pass the
origin.

00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:30.460
So, every x you'll get
two velocities.

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:33.535
And that agrees well with the
fact that v^(2) is what

00:44:33.535 --> 00:44:36.083
you will solve for.
And because it's quadratic you

00:44:36.083 --> 00:44:38.650
will get two answers and you
should get two answers;

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:43.318
you should be expecting that.
Okay, now, we are going to find

00:44:43.318 --> 00:44:48.036
one bad boy, bad girl,
bad person, which is going to

00:44:48.036 --> 00:44:52.759
ruin this whole thing.
There is--you know what I'm

00:44:52.759 --> 00:44:54.989
talking about here,
yes?

00:44:54.989 --> 00:44:56.178
Student: Friction
[inaudible]

00:44:56.178 --> 00:44:57.570
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: So,

00:44:57.570 --> 00:45:02.692
friction is a force acting on a
body, so what's the thing I

00:45:02.692 --> 00:45:05.514
should try to do?
Let's take a body with only

00:45:05.514 --> 00:45:08.016
friction acting on it.
Let's not worry about anything

00:45:08.016 --> 00:45:09.949
else, or maybe friction and a
spring.

00:45:09.949 --> 00:45:13.025
So, I try as usual,
to get a Law of Conservation of

00:45:13.025 --> 00:45:16.655
Energy when friction is acting,
and you will see that I will

00:45:16.655 --> 00:45:20.440
not succeed.
And it looks like everything

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.240
here is water-tight,
right?

00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:26.659
Everything looks good.
You tell me the force acting on

00:45:26.659 --> 00:45:28.369
a body.
I integrate the force from

00:45:28.369 --> 00:45:31.269
start to finish and I call that
the difference of potential

00:45:31.269 --> 00:45:33.969
energies;
then I've got my result.

00:45:33.969 --> 00:45:35.997
Try to follow this logic:
K_2 -

00:45:35.997 --> 00:45:37.929
K_1 is integral to
force,

00:45:37.929 --> 00:45:41.018
integral to G(x_2)
- G(x_1) or which

00:45:41.018 --> 00:45:43.409
is U(x_1) -
U(x_2);

00:45:43.409 --> 00:45:45.080
you can rearrange it to get
K_2 +

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.713
U_2 =
K_1 +

00:45:46.713 --> 00:45:48.796
U_1.
Looks like you can always get

00:45:48.796 --> 00:45:51.698
Law of Conservation of Energy.
And you want to know why that

00:45:51.698 --> 00:45:55.160
fails when there is friction.
Okay, why does it fail when

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.835
there is friction?
So, when there is friction--Let

00:45:58.835 --> 00:46:01.839
me try to do it again.
K_2 -

00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:05.170
K_1 is the force
due to the spring,

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:09.099
which is whatever –kx.
Let me do that integral plus

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:12.464
the force of friction dx,
from x_1 to

00:46:12.464 --> 00:46:14.563
x_2.
This one is from

00:46:14.563 --> 00:46:17.106
x_1 to
x_2 and we saw

00:46:17.106 --> 00:46:19.921
what this is.
Let me write it one more time,

00:46:19.921 --> 00:46:22.119
½kx_1^(2)
makes

00:46:22.119 --> 00:46:25.535
½kx_2^(2);
if you didn't have friction you

00:46:25.535 --> 00:46:27.283
are done.
Because you can get kinetic

00:46:27.283 --> 00:46:29.950
plus potential for spring,
is kinetic plus potential.

00:46:35.119 --> 00:46:39.678
Why don't we just integrate the
force of friction and then turn

00:46:39.678 --> 00:46:42.840
that into a U and then
we're done?

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.974
What's going to be the problem?
Let me just give some--anybody

00:46:45.974 --> 00:46:48.654
else want--yes?
Student: It's always

00:46:48.654 --> 00:46:52.617
against the direction of motion
so it would be always changing

00:46:52.617 --> 00:46:55.801
direction force [inaudible]
Professor Ramamurti

00:46:55.801 --> 00:46:58.659
Shankar: Okay what was your
answer?

00:46:58.659 --> 00:47:01.674
Student: You can't
associate a potential function

00:47:01.674 --> 00:47:04.250
with friction because it depends
on the path,

00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:07.570
not only the initial position
and final position.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:11.038
The anti-derivative only
considers the final and the

00:47:11.038 --> 00:47:13.079
initial position.
Professor Ramamurti

00:47:13.079 --> 00:47:14.781
Shankar: Right,
but let's suppose I'm somewhere

00:47:14.781 --> 00:47:16.619
and I'm pulling a block and
there is some friction,

00:47:16.619 --> 00:47:18.486
there is some force F at
the location,

00:47:18.486 --> 00:47:21.080
there's my F.
Why don't I just use the value

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.619
of F?
Yes?

00:47:23.619 --> 00:47:28.780
Student: Energy is lost
due to heat.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:30.144
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: I know but see,

00:47:30.144 --> 00:47:31.510
you are saying something else
which is speaking,

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:34.164
I had into the book,
but right now what's the

00:47:34.164 --> 00:47:37.119
problem with integrating the
force of friction?

00:47:37.119 --> 00:47:39.824
Student: I was just
going to say the energy of the

00:47:39.824 --> 00:47:42.673
force of friction is no longer
within the system [inaudible]

00:47:42.673 --> 00:47:44.750
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: No,

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.517
but you're all telling me why
there is a loss of mechanical

00:47:47.517 --> 00:47:49.329
energy but I'm just a
mathematician.

00:47:49.329 --> 00:47:51.400
I'm saying, give me a force,
find its integral.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:52.909
What's the problem?
Yes.

00:47:52.909 --> 00:47:55.778
Student: Is it because
the function to the force of

00:47:55.778 --> 00:47:57.539
friction depends on the
velocity?

00:47:57.539 --> 00:47:58.682
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: Yes,

00:47:58.682 --> 00:48:00.059
I think somebody else said that
earlier also.

00:48:00.059 --> 00:48:05.070
The force of friction is not a
function of x.

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:06.539
You might say,
"What do you mean?"

00:48:06.539 --> 00:48:08.949
I'm pushing this guy,
I know how hard it's pushing me

00:48:08.949 --> 00:48:11.730
back, but I'm telling you now,
"Push it the opposite way!"

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:15.621
Then, you'll find the force of
friction at the very same

00:48:15.621 --> 00:48:19.583
location is pointing in a
different direction whereas the

00:48:19.583 --> 00:48:23.050
force of a spring is the force
of the spring.

00:48:23.050 --> 00:48:24.847
It's -kx,
whether you're going towards

00:48:24.847 --> 00:48:26.890
the spring or you're going away
from the spring;

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.429
try to think about that.
Same with gravity.

00:48:29.429 --> 00:48:32.591
Gravity is pulling you down
with a force -mg and it

00:48:32.591 --> 00:48:35.920
doesn't care whether the chalk
is going up or coming down.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.530
On the way up it's pulling it
down;

00:48:37.530 --> 00:48:40.147
on the way down it's also
pulling it down,

00:48:40.147 --> 00:48:43.530
because at a given location
there is a fixed force.

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:46.432
So, the problem is not the
force varies with x or

00:48:46.432 --> 00:48:49.440
y, but the force is a
function only of x.

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.795
But if the function of x
and velocity then you also have

00:48:52.795 --> 00:48:55.539
to know the velocity,
and no one's giving you then a

00:48:55.539 --> 00:48:58.539
definite value for the velocity
because in the vibrating mass

00:48:58.539 --> 00:49:01.250
and spring,
velocity can have either sign.

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:06.389
Therefore, we do this integral
but we don't do this.

00:49:06.389 --> 00:49:08.950
Even though I write it this
way, mathematically it's wrong

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:10.926
because the force of
friction--Is it really a

00:49:10.926 --> 00:49:13.513
function of x?
I'll tell you in what limited

00:49:13.513 --> 00:49:16.490
sense it is a function and what
technical sense it is not.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:19.249
Let's defer that for now.
Take all these guys to the

00:49:19.249 --> 00:49:20.604
left-hand side,
so this is

00:49:20.604 --> 00:49:22.500
K_2,
this'll become

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:26.694
U_2,
so you'll get (K_2

00:49:26.694 --> 00:49:29.748
+ U_2) -
(K_1+U

00:49:29.748 --> 00:49:34.150
_1) is equal to
this last thing,

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.333
work done by friction from
x_1 to

00:49:36.333 --> 00:49:38.250
x_2 and the
question is,

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:40.115
"Can I do the integral?"
The answer is,

00:49:40.115 --> 00:49:41.391
if you just tell me
x_1 and

00:49:41.391 --> 00:49:42.846
x_2,
then I know that's the point

00:49:42.846 --> 00:49:45.041
you're making;
I cannot just do an integral

00:49:45.041 --> 00:49:48.420
because I will have to know the
whole story, but in limited

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:52.301
cases I can do this.
Suppose I pulled a mass by an

00:49:52.301 --> 00:49:57.559
amount A and I let it go,
but now there is friction.

00:49:57.559 --> 00:50:01.789
I think we all know that if it
came to the center it won't be

00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:04.352
going quite as fast.
And we also know,

00:50:04.352 --> 00:50:07.686
when it overshoots the other
side, it will not go back to

00:50:07.686 --> 00:50:10.066
–A;
normally, it will go back to

00:50:10.066 --> 00:50:12.676
-A.
Everyone knows why it goes back

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:14.050
to -A,
right?

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.996
When you go the other extremity
without friction,

00:50:16.996 --> 00:50:20.763
your energy is all potential.
It was ½kA^(2) to begin

00:50:20.763 --> 00:50:23.829
with, it's going to be
½kA^(2) at the end,

00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:26.476
except A can go to
-A without changing the

00:50:26.476 --> 00:50:27.910
answer;
that's why it'll go from

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:30.320
A to -A.
But when you've got friction,

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.170
I cannot say the energies are
equal because I've got to do

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:36.105
this integral.
For this part of the journey

00:50:36.105 --> 00:50:39.159
from here to here,
during that part of the

00:50:39.159 --> 00:50:42.809
journey, the force is a
well-defined function.

00:50:42.809 --> 00:50:47.545
Namely, it is a constant value
-µ times mg and

00:50:47.545 --> 00:50:51.155
it is acting this way.
So, for this part of the trip,

00:50:51.155 --> 00:50:53.550
I can do the integral.
It is very easy to find out

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:56.599
what it is;
it's -mg times µ

00:50:56.599 --> 00:50:59.750
kinetic, times the distance
traveled.

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:03.429
Of course, it's a little more
complicated now.

00:51:03.429 --> 00:51:06.010
You have to tell me where you
want your velocities.

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:09.766
You might say,
find the velocity at x =

00:51:09.766 --> 00:51:12.140
0.
If you want me to do that,

00:51:12.140 --> 00:51:16.300
the distances traveled is the
original displacement.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.329
That's what is the stuff on
that side.

00:51:19.329 --> 00:51:23.428
And here, K_2
= ½mv^(2) which is what

00:51:23.428 --> 00:51:27.769
I'm trying to find.
I am at the origin so it's

00:51:27.769 --> 00:51:32.840
½k times 0^(2),
no potential energy.

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.131
Initially, there is no kinetic
energy but there was potential

00:51:37.131 --> 00:51:42.800
energy ½kA^(2).
You follow that logic now?

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:45.661
This is the difference in
energies due to the conserved

00:51:45.661 --> 00:51:48.324
forces, the conserved energies,
but the difference

00:51:48.324 --> 00:51:50.864
E_2 -
E_1 is no longer 0

00:51:50.864 --> 00:51:53.964
but is given by this number.
So, I can calculate it for this

00:51:53.964 --> 00:51:55.192
part.
I can even ask,

00:51:55.192 --> 00:51:58.736
-- this is one of the homework
problems, I think -- you're

00:51:58.736 --> 00:52:01.410
asked, "How far does it go to
the left?"

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:07.094
Well, what do you do?
Let's call the place where it

00:52:07.094 --> 00:52:10.187
goes to.
The left most extremity is

00:52:10.187 --> 00:52:13.268
A prime.
Then we don't know,

00:52:13.268 --> 00:52:17.720
so there when you go to
K_2 + U_2

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.473
- K_1+
U_1,

00:52:20.473 --> 00:52:23.550
you will go back to this
formula.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:27.038
First of all,
the distance that the force of

00:52:27.038 --> 00:52:31.988
friction acts on is how much--is
the distance A to come

00:52:31.988 --> 00:52:36.369
here and another A prime
to go to the left.

00:52:36.369 --> 00:52:39.010
A prime is a magnitude
of how far you go to the left.

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.771
And likewise,
on the left-hand side you've

00:52:41.771 --> 00:52:45.610
got to have the total kinetic
plus potential minus kinetic

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:48.340
plus potential.
At the end of the day,

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:52.230
you only have potential energy
½k A prime squared,

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:56.286
no kinetic and initially,
again, you only have potential

00:52:56.286 --> 00:53:00.430
energy ½kA^(2).
You will see that A prime now

00:53:00.430 --> 00:53:03.970
satisfies a quadratic equation;
you can solve it.

00:53:08.750 --> 00:53:12.822
But what is the point?
The point is you cannot do this

00:53:12.822 --> 00:53:17.017
integral once and for all and
say the answer depends on the

00:53:17.017 --> 00:53:20.074
end points.
In this particular problem,

00:53:20.074 --> 00:53:24.239
if you told me you are doing
this part of the journey,

00:53:24.239 --> 00:53:27.792
during that part of the journey
because for the entire trip,

00:53:27.792 --> 00:53:30.019
the velocity had a particular
sign,

00:53:30.019 --> 00:53:32.273
namely to the left,
force of friction had a

00:53:32.273 --> 00:53:35.010
definite magnitude and sign,
namely to the right,

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:38.151
and then of course it's as good
as any legitimate function and

00:53:38.151 --> 00:53:40.556
you can do the integral.
In fact, the forces are

00:53:40.556 --> 00:53:42.311
constant;
you can pull it out of the

00:53:42.311 --> 00:53:45.093
integral, and the integral
dx is just the distance

00:53:45.093 --> 00:53:47.253
traveled.
Okay, so work done by

00:53:47.253 --> 00:53:51.794
friction--it will always come
out negative and you should keep

00:53:51.794 --> 00:53:53.060
track of that.

00:53:57.170 --> 00:54:01.840
Okay, so the final bottom line
for Law of Conservation of

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:06.510
Energy that you guys should
remember is the following.

00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:09.340
You take all the forces acting
on a body.

00:54:09.340 --> 00:54:12.240
So, lets do it one more time in
our heads, so you know where

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.095
everything comes from.
Everything comes from this

00:54:15.095 --> 00:54:17.866
result K_2 -
K_1,

00:54:17.866 --> 00:54:21.539
which is the work done,
is integral of all the forces.

00:54:21.539 --> 00:54:26.235
Divide the forces into forces
that depend on location only and

00:54:26.235 --> 00:54:29.159
not on anything else,
like velocity.

00:54:29.159 --> 00:54:33.899
Let me just divide them into
two forces, one is a good force,

00:54:33.899 --> 00:54:38.244
F_g dx,
and one is a force of friction,

00:54:38.244 --> 00:54:41.086
dx.
This guy will turn into a

00:54:41.086 --> 00:54:44.730
potential energy difference.
Let me just take one good force

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:47.103
and the force of friction.
If you had two,

00:54:47.103 --> 00:54:50.346
each will generate its own
potential when you do the

00:54:50.346 --> 00:54:52.597
integral.
Then, we may then say

00:54:52.597 --> 00:54:55.289
E_2 -
E_1;

00:54:55.289 --> 00:54:58.095
that's the same as
(K_2 +

00:54:58.095 --> 00:55:02.795
U_2) - (K_1
+U_1) is equal to

00:55:02.795 --> 00:55:06.767
the work done by friction.
Work done by friction is the

00:55:06.767 --> 00:55:09.860
shorthand for that integral
which you can do only;

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:14.289
you must divide the motion
involved into pieces.

00:55:14.289 --> 00:55:16.721
For example,
if you have a mass that swung

00:55:16.721 --> 00:55:20.219
to the left then turns around
and goes back to the right,

00:55:20.219 --> 00:55:22.255
of course, again,
it won't come back to the

00:55:22.255 --> 00:55:24.340
original, it'll come to a
smaller number.

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.569
That's because there's more
loss of energy on the return

00:55:27.569 --> 00:55:28.919
trip.
For the return trip,

00:55:28.919 --> 00:55:30.610
you must do the problem
separately.

00:55:30.610 --> 00:55:33.093
On the return trip,
you start from this A

00:55:33.093 --> 00:55:35.841
prime that you found,
then start moving to the right,

00:55:35.841 --> 00:55:37.849
the friction will act to the
left.

00:55:37.849 --> 00:55:40.119
So, you must divide the motion
into segments.

00:55:40.119 --> 00:55:43.381
During each segment the force
should have a definite direction

00:55:43.381 --> 00:55:45.679
and magnitude so you can do the
integral.

00:55:45.679 --> 00:55:48.537
The point is,
there is no universal formula

00:55:48.537 --> 00:55:52.859
for F(x) due to friction.
So, in one dimension that's all

00:55:52.859 --> 00:55:56.685
it is, bringing the good and bad
forces, those which lead to

00:55:56.685 --> 00:56:00.077
potential, those which don't;
the difference is the good

00:56:00.077 --> 00:56:02.459
forces are functions of
x, bad forces are

00:56:02.459 --> 00:56:04.690
functions of x and
something else,

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:07.602
so that at a given x
it's possible to have two values

00:56:07.602 --> 00:56:09.347
for that function.
Mathematically,

00:56:09.347 --> 00:56:12.175
we don't call it a function,
that's why you cannot do the

00:56:12.175 --> 00:56:15.146
integral once and for all.
So, this is the Law of

00:56:15.146 --> 00:56:18.030
Conservation of Energy.
Okay?

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:22.211
Alright now,
what I have to do here for the

00:56:22.211 --> 00:56:28.484
remaining time is a little more
of some mathematical preparation

00:56:28.484 --> 00:56:33.497
for what I'm going to do next.
What I'm going to do next is to

00:56:33.497 --> 00:56:36.436
go to higher dimensions and
we've got to make sure we all

00:56:36.436 --> 00:56:39.480
know some of the mathematical
ideas connected to the higher

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.284
dimensions.
So, I'm going to start off with

00:56:42.284 --> 00:56:45.769
some things and this is like a
mathematical interlude.

00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:48.064
Again, I told you,
if you're not strong on some of

00:56:48.064 --> 00:56:50.734
these things you should read
this math book I mentioned to

00:56:50.734 --> 00:56:53.630
you on Basic Training;
it'll certainly cover these

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:55.376
topics.
But you don't have to have

00:56:55.376 --> 00:56:57.760
that, I'm going to tell you now
how to do it.

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.612
So, the math idea that I'm
going to use,

00:57:00.612 --> 00:57:04.341
see this is really a
mathematical digression to make

00:57:04.341 --> 00:57:07.750
sure everybody knows,
they are very simple things,

00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:11.023
but we do it all the time in
physics so I want to make sure

00:57:11.023 --> 00:57:15.518
you guys can also do that.
So, let's take some function

00:57:15.518 --> 00:57:18.989
F(x) that looks like
this.

00:57:18.989 --> 00:57:22.901
This is F(x),
this is x [pointing to

00:57:22.901 --> 00:57:23.620
graph].

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:30.309
And let's say you start here,
at some point x.

00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:34.889
And I'm going to go to a nearby
point, x + Δx.

00:57:34.889 --> 00:57:40.030
Δx is exaggerated so
you can see it.

00:57:40.030 --> 00:57:42.920
So, actually in the end it's
going to be a very small number.

00:57:46.699 --> 00:57:49.681
The question is,
"What is the change in the

00:57:49.681 --> 00:57:52.450
function in going from here to
here?"

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:55.848
So, we all know what it is;
that is the change in the

00:57:55.848 --> 00:57:56.420
function.

00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:03.815
We are going to need
approximations to the change in

00:58:03.815 --> 00:58:06.948
the function.
The useful approximation is to

00:58:06.948 --> 00:58:11.646
say, let us pretend the function
is a straight line and keeps

00:58:11.646 --> 00:58:15.170
going with the slope it had to
begin with.

00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:18.529
You can see that if the
function is not curving up or

00:58:18.529 --> 00:58:21.436
down too much,
you almost got the right change

00:58:21.436 --> 00:58:24.070
in F.
And what is the change in

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:26.989
F?
That change in F is a

00:58:26.989 --> 00:58:31.629
derivative of the function at
the point x times the

00:58:31.629 --> 00:58:37.570
change in x.
But it is not an equality;

00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:41.466
it is not an equality because
there is this little guy on the

00:58:41.466 --> 00:58:44.812
top that you have missed.
Because the function is not

00:58:44.812 --> 00:58:47.879
following the same slope that
you have to begin with,

00:58:47.879 --> 00:58:50.330
it's curving up.
So, let's take a concrete

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:54.773
example.
Suppose F(x) = x^(2),

00:58:54.773 --> 00:59:05.719
then F(x + Δx ) = x^(2)
+ 2xΔx + Δx^(2).

00:59:05.719 --> 00:59:09.674
Therefore, the change in
F -- you got to take it

00:59:09.674 --> 00:59:13.555
to the other side -- change in
F = 2xΔx

00:59:13.555 --> 00:59:15.858
+Δx^(2).
2xΔx,

00:59:15.858 --> 00:59:18.631
2x is,
of course, what you realize is

00:59:18.631 --> 00:59:22.050
that the derivative of the
function at that point.

00:59:22.050 --> 00:59:26.073
And that's giving you this part
but there's a tiny portion on

00:59:26.073 --> 00:59:30.030
the top, which is Δx^(2)
that you're not getting.

00:59:30.030 --> 00:59:31.606
If the function is
x^(3),

00:59:31.606 --> 00:59:34.556
then x to the fourth,
then hyperbolic cos (x)

00:59:34.556 --> 00:59:37.015
there'll be more errors.
But the point is,

00:59:37.015 --> 00:59:40.184
the change in the function has
a leading piece that's

00:59:40.184 --> 00:59:43.313
proportional Δx,
and then the corrections that

00:59:43.313 --> 00:59:46.230
we see mathematically are of
higher order in Δx.

00:59:49.989 --> 00:59:53.098
So, if Δx is made very
small but not zero,

00:59:53.098 --> 00:59:56.713
then it's a very useful formula
to know that the change in

00:59:56.713 --> 01:00:00.329
function and going from one
point to another point is this

01:00:00.329 --> 01:00:04.211
rate of change times the change.
I don't think anything could be

01:00:04.211 --> 01:00:07.281
more natural than that.
But we should be comfortable by

01:00:07.281 --> 01:00:10.771
saying it's naively people say,
"Well, you should do that

01:00:10.771 --> 01:00:14.261
because in calculus you're
canceling this Δx with

01:00:14.261 --> 01:00:16.818
that dx."
That's not what we're really

01:00:16.818 --> 01:00:18.923
doing.
We all know that this stands

01:00:18.923 --> 01:00:22.127
for a certain limit,
but the limit stands literally

01:00:22.127 --> 01:00:24.690
for the slope which is at that
point.

01:00:24.690 --> 01:00:27.780
So, if functions had only one
slope and they never changed

01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:29.840
their slope and you knew that
slope,

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.374
then if you know the value to
begin with, you can find the

01:00:32.374 --> 01:00:35.087
value a mile away from where you
are because it's going at the

01:00:35.087 --> 01:00:37.598
same clip.
But most functions of course

01:00:37.598 --> 01:00:41.107
will change the slope,
and for that reason there will

01:00:41.107 --> 01:00:44.750
be an error in the formula you
get if you use this.

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:47.790
But if Δx is very,
very small and it's your

01:00:47.790 --> 01:00:49.980
intention in the end to make
very,

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.198
very tiny Δxs then we
say we will use this

01:00:53.198 --> 01:00:54.250
approximation.

01:00:57.929 --> 01:01:01.079
That's very simple but it's
very useful to know.

01:01:01.079 --> 01:01:04.584
So, let's take an example of
this function,

01:01:04.584 --> 01:01:08.255
of this rule,
because I'm going to use it all

01:01:08.255 --> 01:01:09.340
the time.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:22.680
So, one example is F(x)
= (1 + x)^(n).

01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:35.348
Well, F(1) is just one.
Suppose you go to a nearby

01:01:35.348 --> 01:01:38.349
point which is x away
from the .1;

01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:42.490
so, this x is really
like your Δx,

01:01:42.490 --> 01:01:47.493
then the change in the function
will be df/dx at the

01:01:47.493 --> 01:01:51.030
point 1 times the change in
x.

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:56.595
Yes?
Student: [inaudible]

01:01:56.595 --> 01:01:59.487
Professor Ramamurti
Shankar: I'm sorry,

01:01:59.487 --> 01:02:02.719
ah, ok, that's right.
F(0) if you like;

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:07.389
if x = 0, the function has a
value of one.

01:02:07.389 --> 01:02:09.752
Then, if you go to a
neighboring point--;So,

01:02:09.752 --> 01:02:12.554
here is what I'm saying,
the function does something

01:02:12.554 --> 01:02:15.686
which value here is one and I
want to go to a nearby point

01:02:15.686 --> 01:02:20.137
which I'm calling x.
Then, df/dx you know is

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:24.619
n times 1 + x^(n)
-1 times x.

01:02:24.619 --> 01:02:29.501
But you have evaluated it at
x = 0,

01:02:29.501 --> 01:02:34.739
so this goes away,
then you get nx.

01:02:34.739 --> 01:02:38.701
So, the change in the function,
this function as you move off

01:02:38.701 --> 01:02:43.093
x = 0 is nx.
So, what we are saying then is

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:48.011
1 + x raised to the
n is 1 + nx + tiny

01:02:48.011 --> 01:02:50.810
numbers, if x is small.

01:02:54.570 --> 01:03:00.150
That is a very useful result.
If something looks like 1 + x

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:03.615
raised to a power,
and if you're not going too far

01:03:03.615 --> 01:03:06.823
from the point 1,
namely if your x is very

01:03:06.823 --> 01:03:10.295
small, then don't bother with
doing the whole 1 + x times 1 +

01:03:10.295 --> 01:03:12.835
xn times,
it's approximately equal to 1 +

01:03:12.835 --> 01:03:13.490
nx.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:21.700
So, let me give you one example;
you will use this later on.

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:32.078
According to relativity,
a mass of a particle is given

01:03:32.078 --> 01:03:36.500
by this [writes formula on the
board].

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.630
It's a body sitting still,
it has certain mass.

01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:42.077
In Newtonian mechanics we say
the mass is the mass and that's

01:03:42.077 --> 01:03:44.072
the end of it.
Relativity, you don't have to

01:03:44.072 --> 01:03:46.589
know the origin of this;
that'll be taught to you in due

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:48.349
course.
But it just says particle to

01:03:48.349 --> 01:03:51.117
the velocity have a mass
different from when they are at

01:03:51.117 --> 01:03:52.871
rest.
And this is the velocity and

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:54.560
c is the velocity of
light.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.547
This is the exact formula.
Now, most of the time we don't

01:03:58.547 --> 01:04:02.489
care about it because v/c
maybe 10^(-10) and the square of

01:04:02.489 --> 01:04:06.246
that is 10^(-20) and one minus
such a number is negligible and

01:04:06.246 --> 01:04:09.660
we just put it as one.
Suppose you want an answer

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:13.685
that's good to some accuracy.
I will write this as follows,

01:04:13.685 --> 01:04:18.042
as m_0 times 1
- v^(2) over c^(2)

01:04:18.042 --> 01:04:20.670
to the power of -½ ,
do you agree?

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:23.695
That's what a square root in
the bottom is,

01:04:23.695 --> 01:04:28.204
it's this power upstairs.
Now, we can write it as

01:04:28.204 --> 01:04:33.778
follows, m_0,
this is (1 + x)^(n),

01:04:33.778 --> 01:04:36.942
okay?
So the x that we use is

01:04:36.942 --> 01:04:41.260
-v^(2)/c^(2) and the
n that we use is -½.

01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.699
That's what I'm using in this
formula;

01:04:48.699 --> 01:04:51.229
x is
-v^(2)/c^(2) and

01:04:51.229 --> 01:04:54.251
n, which is the power to
which I'm raising,

01:04:54.251 --> 01:04:57.365
is -½;
therefore, this is equal to 1 +

01:04:57.365 --> 01:05:00.900
v^(2)/2c^(2) plus
corrections,

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.986
which are negligible if
v^(2)/c^(2) is very

01:05:03.986 --> 01:05:07.380
small.
This is a very useful result.

01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:12.368
It tells you the mass variation
is that is the mass at rest plus

01:05:12.368 --> 01:05:15.535
m_0v^(2)/
2c^(2),

01:05:15.535 --> 01:05:20.094
it's a very useful formula.
Sometimes this formula is much

01:05:20.094 --> 01:05:23.250
more friendly to use than the
exact formula.

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:25.280
You cannot beat the exact
formula;

01:05:25.280 --> 01:05:28.654
it's the exact truth but if
you're interested in that exact

01:05:28.654 --> 01:05:31.797
function for small values of
v/c, it's much more

01:05:31.797 --> 01:05:33.949
useful to use this
approximation.

01:05:33.949 --> 01:05:37.137
And you will have a lot of
problems like this in your

01:05:37.137 --> 01:05:39.590
homework, now,
later, everywhere else.

01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:42.984
So, if I'm going to use it all
the time I should tell you what

01:05:42.984 --> 01:05:45.191
it is.
So, let me summarize what I've

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.200
told you so far.
First result is,

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.735
if a function is known at a
certain point and you want to

01:05:50.735 --> 01:05:54.334
know its value at a nearby
point, what are you supposed to

01:05:54.334 --> 01:05:56.436
do?
That's not so hard to guess

01:05:56.436 --> 01:05:57.562
right?
For example,

01:05:57.562 --> 01:06:00.530
your tuition costs are so much
this year at Yale.

01:06:00.530 --> 01:06:03.769
And we know how much it's going
up every year;

01:06:03.769 --> 01:06:06.230
you can make a guess on what
it'll be a year from now.

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:08.788
Of course in reality,
it'll be higher than that

01:06:08.788 --> 01:06:12.015
because there is other terms,
but that's the best guess you

01:06:12.015 --> 01:06:14.394
would make.
That's how we predict the

01:06:14.394 --> 01:06:17.050
future by looking at past rates
of change;

01:06:17.050 --> 01:06:19.539
that's very normal.
The point is that you can

01:06:19.539 --> 01:06:21.651
predict the tuition in a year
from now maybe,

01:06:21.651 --> 01:06:24.242
but maybe not five years from
now or ten years from now

01:06:24.242 --> 01:06:26.690
because there's inflation on top
of inflation.

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:30.168
That's like saying the rate of
change itself has a rate of

01:06:30.168 --> 01:06:33.829
change, the slope here is not
the same as the slope there,

01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:36.690
that's what the higher
derivatives of the function do

01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:39.450
for you.
So, I will conclude by telling

01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:43.503
you one last result which I'm
not going to prove in this

01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:46.235
course.
And you guys should learn from

01:06:46.235 --> 01:06:49.030
the math department the
following result.

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:53.178
There is some crazy function,
okay, this is f(x),

01:06:53.178 --> 01:06:56.950
I want to know what it is at
the point x.

01:06:56.950 --> 01:07:01.036
I know what it is at the origin.
If I know nothing else,

01:07:01.036 --> 01:07:03.319
how do I predict the future
value of x,

01:07:03.319 --> 01:07:05.500
meaning for other x I
don't know.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.900
My best guess is,
well, this is the number I knew

01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:11.217
that's what it's going to do.
But if I knew its rate of

01:07:11.217 --> 01:07:13.834
change here, you know,
its slope here,

01:07:13.834 --> 01:07:17.370
the next guess is the
derivative of f at the

01:07:17.370 --> 01:07:21.019
origin times x.
That's just what I did earlier;

01:07:21.019 --> 01:07:23.050
instead of Δx I'm
calling it x.

01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:25.260
If x is small enough
it'll work.

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:28.159
But of course,
x need not be small;

01:07:28.159 --> 01:07:30.585
if it gets bigger,
it turns out you can do a

01:07:30.585 --> 01:07:33.800
little better by adding this
[writes formula on board].

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:38.000
This is the second derivative
of the function at the origin

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.055
times x^(2) and you can
go on adding more and more

01:07:42.055 --> 01:07:45.577
terms.
I'll just add one more term,

01:07:45.577 --> 01:07:48.773
which is 1/3 times
d^(3)x,

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:52.570
f/dx^(3) times
x^(3).

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:56.823
This goes on forever.
And it says that if you knew

01:07:56.823 --> 01:08:01.166
every derivative of the function
at the origin you can

01:08:01.166 --> 01:08:05.096
reconstruct the function.
Not just infinitesimally close

01:08:05.096 --> 01:08:08.532
to it, but as far as you want to
go, there are some mathematical

01:08:08.532 --> 01:08:11.586
restrictions on this because
there are infinite number of

01:08:11.586 --> 01:08:14.445
terms in this thing.
When you add them all up you

01:08:14.445 --> 01:08:16.689
may get infinity which would be
nonsense.

01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:19.566
So, you should really sum up
this infinite number of terms if

01:08:19.566 --> 01:08:22.443
they add up to a finite number,
and if they do that will give

01:08:22.443 --> 01:08:25.465
you the function here.
What we have done is to just

01:08:25.465 --> 01:08:28.319
use the first two terms as an
approximation.

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:31.101
Or what I'm telling you is that
there is something called The

01:08:31.101 --> 01:08:33.743
Taylor Expansion of a function
that allows you to know the

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:35.696
function even here,
macroscopically,

01:08:35.696 --> 01:08:38.300
far from here if you knew all
the derivatives.

01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:41.557
And if you put those
derivatives here and if the sum

01:08:41.557 --> 01:08:45.326
added up to something finite,
that finite thing is the value

01:08:45.326 --> 01:08:47.689
of the function at the new
point.

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:52.800
Here is an example you guys can
take, f(x) = e^(x).

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:58.160
Why don't you go home and work
out the series for f(x)

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.863
at all points?
You have got to remember that

01:09:00.863 --> 01:09:02.970
e^(x) has a beauty,
that the derivative is

01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:05.799
e^(x) itself.
And its value at the origin of

01:09:05.799 --> 01:09:10.033
every derivative is simply one.
So, this just becomes 1 +

01:09:10.033 --> 01:09:13.419
x + x^(2)/2.
And that is,

01:09:13.419 --> 01:09:17.661
in fact, the expression for
e^(x) and it turns out

01:09:17.661 --> 01:09:20.539
that no matter how big x
is,

01:09:20.539 --> 01:09:23.615
the sum in fact adds up to a
finite number that we call

01:09:23.615 --> 01:09:25.693
e^(x).
And in particular,

01:09:25.693 --> 01:09:29.430
what is e itself,
e itself e to the

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:32.114
1;
e is e to the 1

01:09:32.114 --> 01:09:37.127
so put x = 1 you get 1 +
1 + 1^(2) over 2 factorial plus

01:09:37.127 --> 01:09:41.283
1^(3) over 3 factorial.
You do all that you get 2 point

01:09:41.283 --> 01:09:44.670
something, something.
Alright, that's e.

01:09:44.670 --> 01:09:47.659
So, this is a very powerful
notion.

01:09:47.659 --> 01:09:50.459
If you knew all the derivatives
of a function,

01:09:50.459 --> 01:09:53.942
you can predict its value not
only the tiny neighborhood,

01:09:53.942 --> 01:09:56.945
but over big distance.
If you knew the first

01:09:56.945 --> 01:09:59.850
derivative and you were not very
ambitious.

01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:03.143
Look, the logic is very simple.
If x is a tiny number

01:10:03.143 --> 01:10:06.069
x^(2) is even tinier,
x^(3) is even tinier.

01:10:06.069 --> 01:10:07.659
We've got no respect for these
terms.

01:10:07.659 --> 01:10:10.550
We just drop them and we stop
here.

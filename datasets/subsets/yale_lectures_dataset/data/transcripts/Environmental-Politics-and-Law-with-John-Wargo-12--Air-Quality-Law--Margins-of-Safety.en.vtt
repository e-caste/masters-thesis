00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:04.029
Prof: Today,
we're going to embark on a

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:06.020
discussion about air quality
law.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.525
And I'm going to start with
really an assertion by the

00:00:10.525 --> 00:00:15.795
Environmental Protection Agency
that I've come to think of as a

00:00:15.795 --> 00:00:19.051
myth of sorts,
when they have claimed that the

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:21.803
nation's air quality has
improved dramatically in the

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:23.180
past twenty-five years.
 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.220
Well, how would you know if
that's true?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.610
How would you contest that?
 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.350
What kind of evidence would you
want?

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.234
And what we'll find today is
that your answer to this really

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:35.790
depends upon what pollutants you
choose to measure,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.293
what you know about the
toxicity of different

00:00:38.293 --> 00:00:40.324
pollutants,
where you measure the

00:00:40.324 --> 00:00:43.853
pollutants, do you measure them
in a fixed monitor out in the

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:47.440
field someplace in the middle of
northeastern Connecticut?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.807
Or do you do it next to a
highway in New Haven or

00:00:50.807 --> 00:00:51.720
Bridgeport?
 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.450
And how you spend your time.
 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.720
Where do you spend the majority
of your time?

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.509
I bet it's not where EPA
measures pollutants.

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:03.162
The majority of your time is
spent indoors,

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:05.689
I would guess,
overwhelmingly indoors.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.000
And how do you behave indoors?
 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.525
And by that I mean,
how would your behavior affect

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:14.260
your exposure to pollutants
indoors?

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.682
These are all questions that
became apparent late in the

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:20.545
twentieth century,
are really important to know

00:01:20.545 --> 00:01:22.349
whether or not law works.
 

00:01:22.349 --> 00:01:24.948
And this law,
the Clean Air Act,

00:01:24.948 --> 00:01:28.235
the pesticide law,
it has a very technical

00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:30.769
character to it,
and I think that you can

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:34.120
understand by now in the course
that environmental law is not

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.629
just about making rules.
 

00:01:35.629 --> 00:01:39.849
It's about understanding the
environment and how it works and

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:43.720
how it responds to different
kinds of human stresses.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.194
And also, it's about what we
can do to relieve those

00:01:48.194 --> 00:01:49.160
stresses.
 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.997
So there's a technical side to
this that there is not in many

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:55.690
other forms of law.
 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.787
So is the air quality
improving, and if not,

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:02.640
why?
 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.557
So think about the different
kinds of legal strategies and

00:02:05.557 --> 00:02:08.372
standards that have been
designed to control air quality

00:02:08.372 --> 00:02:09.139
in history?
 

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.810
Well one is land use and zoning.
 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.680
So thinking about how you'd
segregate different land uses.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.092
So you keep the industrial
facilities or say the military

00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:20.530
sites away from the residential
areas.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.525
So this idea of segregation or
buffering land uses where you

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:28.181
know you have high levels of
emissions from those where

00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.620
people reside away from schools.
 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.470
This was one of the earliest
forms of attempted control.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.875
And there are examples in
London back in the seventeenth

00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:40.220
century of prohibiting certain
kinds of facilities,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.560
rendering plants or plants that
produce a lot of smoke in the

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.310
air from being in residential
areas.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.226
Another approach to controlling
air quality is the idea if

00:02:51.226 --> 00:02:54.729
setting a ceiling or an
allowable emission limit.

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:58.650
So the idea that you would
chemical by chemical set an

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.087
allowable level of contamination
in the air has become really

00:03:03.087 --> 00:03:07.451
central to the way that we've
thought about trying to manage

00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.710
our health.
 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.811
So have these policies been
developed in a way that's

00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:15.650
precautionary,
to prevent significant

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.068
deterioration?
 

00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:20.818
And as you look at the
structure of the Clean Air Act,

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:23.752
you'll see that the idea,
prevention of significant

00:03:23.752 --> 00:03:27.699
deterioration,
is a really critical concept.

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:30.727
So we don't -- as a nation
we've decided we don't really

00:03:30.727 --> 00:03:33.370
want to make the air quality
worse that it is.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.509
That we're on a path toward
restoration or improvement in

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.250
quality.
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.911
We've also found that it's
important to think differently

00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:45.770
about mobile sources than it is
about stationary sources.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.751
And quite frankly,
if you were the administrator

00:03:48.751 --> 00:03:52.431
of the Environmental Protection
Agency back in 1970 and you

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:56.047
walked into this problem of
having a zillion stacks in the

00:03:56.047 --> 00:03:59.410
county that were emitting
dangerous chemicals,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.960
you would concentrate on very
visible sources.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.968
So it's a very different kind
of a problem,

00:04:07.968 --> 00:04:10.669
and one where we've made more
progress because we could

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.870
identify the stack and we could
put monitors on those stacks,

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.850
than we face in indoor
environments,

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.906
when we don't really have any
understanding of the kinds of

00:04:19.906 --> 00:04:21.699
chemicals that we're exposed to.
 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:23.935
Trans-boundary flows of
pollution have been

00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:26.170
traditionally very difficult to
control.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.476
The Canadians are pretty upset
with us in the way that we

00:04:30.476 --> 00:04:34.552
transfer much of the air
pollution that is produced in

00:04:34.552 --> 00:04:39.319
the Midwestern United States up
across central and northeastern

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.319
Canada.
 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:44.112
As is New York upset with Ohio
and the power plants in Ohio

00:04:44.112 --> 00:04:47.904
that are burning more coal and
the pollutants from Ohio are

00:04:47.904 --> 00:04:49.540
moving into New York.
 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.762
So how do we control
trans-boundary movements across

00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:56.050
state boundaries or across even
local boundaries,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.389
or the most difficult situation
would be national boundaries.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.069
Property rights to pollute.
 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.949
This is an interesting idea.
 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.048
And really, this idea that you
could set an allowable ceiling

00:05:08.048 --> 00:05:12.146
and instead of telling every
person that lives in that region

00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:16.449
that they have to comply with a
certain level of emission,

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.889
that you put a cap on the total
emission for that region,

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.480
and then gradually you lower
that cap down.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.290
So this is the idea of cap and
trade.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:28.047
And it really grew out of an
attempt to control acid

00:05:28.047 --> 00:05:32.245
precipitation associated with
sulfur dioxides and nitrogen

00:05:32.245 --> 00:05:35.930
oxides that caused a whole array
of problems,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.810
including loss of certain
species.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.290
So in the Adirondacks,
I take a seminar to the

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.329
Adirondacks in the fall every
year.

00:05:44.329 --> 00:05:48.870
All the lakes above 2,500 feet
in elevation don't have trout in

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.339
the Adirondacks because of the
way that SO_2 and NOx

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.661
create acid aerosols that rain
down and make those lakes too

00:05:57.661 --> 00:06:00.300
acidic for those fish to grow.
 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.120
Buildings around the world have
been deteriorated,

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.461
especially if they're made out
of limestone because of acid

00:06:06.461 --> 00:06:07.209
aerosols.
 

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:10.766
The red spruce at high
elevations in the Northeastern

00:06:10.766 --> 00:06:11.930
U.S., up on Mt.
 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.641
Washington or up in the
Adirondacks or the Green

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:17.240
Mountains, those red spruce are
in decline.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.601
And the decline is caused by
the fact that clouds hang over

00:06:21.601 --> 00:06:26.339
the tops of these mountain peaks
and the fog itself is acid,

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.444
so that it's causing
vulnerability to different

00:06:29.444 --> 00:06:30.120
illness.
 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.132
So capping and trading is now
believed to be the more

00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:36.910
efficient way to reduce
pollution.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.810
The idea began initially with
Environmental Defense,

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.319
when it was called
Environmental Defense Fund,

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:48.040
but it now has become really
the cornerstone of attempts to

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.110
control the CO_2
problem that we face.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.769
Technology forcing standards:
so what if your technology is

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:59.807
not capable of reducing emission
to the level that you want it to

00:06:59.807 --> 00:07:00.250
be?
 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.939
Well, you can set an
aspirational standard.

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:07.644
By that I mean that you give an
industry or a sector a certain

00:07:07.644 --> 00:07:11.168
period of time within which they
would have to reduce their

00:07:11.168 --> 00:07:12.019
emissions.
 

00:07:12.019 --> 00:07:14.774
By the way, it's only fitting
that I can smell diesel exhaust

00:07:14.774 --> 00:07:15.509
in here today.
 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:17.110
I don't know if anybody else
can smell it.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:20.540
But it must be from the
construction equipment.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.660
It's a fitting topic for the
air quality in the room.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.949
I should have my little monitor
here.

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:29.793
So the idea that you would
create these aspirational

00:07:29.793 --> 00:07:32.470
standards was embedded into the
Clean Air Act.

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.704
Fuel content regulations,
I think it's an interesting

00:07:35.704 --> 00:07:39.187
issue that we've been more
concerned about what comes out

00:07:39.187 --> 00:07:42.982
of the stacks and what comes out
of the tailpipes than we have

00:07:42.982 --> 00:07:46.651
about controlling the fuel and
the process of its burning in

00:07:46.651 --> 00:07:49.139
order to reduce those emissions.
 

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:52.596
So the idea of filtering what
is coming out at the end of the

00:07:52.596 --> 00:07:54.454
process,
the combustion process,

00:07:54.454 --> 00:07:57.440
as opposed to thinking more
carefully about the nature of

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.079
the fuel.
 

00:07:58.079 --> 00:08:02.310
We made serious mistakes in
history, thinking about leaded

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.870
fuel as an example.
 

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.314
So lead was added to fuel to
make engines more efficient and

00:08:08.314 --> 00:08:12.610
to knock less and to make them
less prone to breakdown.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.040
But it spewed lead around the
world.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.533
And recognizing that lead got
into the bones of children and

00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:21.375
induced developmental and
neurological disorders,

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:23.389
that's a very important story.
 

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:26.987
So fuel content regulation,
in a way, there's an

00:08:26.987 --> 00:08:31.350
interesting similarity to the
way that we feed animals.

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:36.787
So kind of neglecting residues
that are in animal feed or

00:08:36.787 --> 00:08:42.806
neglecting the strontium-90 that
was in the feed that went into

00:08:42.806 --> 00:08:48.048
cattle and then made its way to
our dinner plates.

00:08:48.048 --> 00:08:52.206
It's similar to neglecting the
content of fuel and just not

00:08:52.206 --> 00:08:54.928
caring about where it's going to
go.

00:08:54.928 --> 00:08:58.221
So thinking about residues out
there in the ambient environment

00:08:58.221 --> 00:09:01.606
as the target for regulation,
as opposed to the underlying

00:09:01.606 --> 00:09:04.424
source,
either the technology of the

00:09:04.424 --> 00:09:07.918
engine or the type of fuel that
is burned.

00:09:07.918 --> 00:09:10.831
So indoor behavioral
regulation, we'll see that after

00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:14.250
the break when we come back and
look at tobacco regulation.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:18.856
So thinking about what is the
right of the government to

00:09:18.856 --> 00:09:23.379
regulate what we do indoors in
our houses as opposed to

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:24.470
outdoors.
 

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.910
And the idea of building
certification standards and

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.730
development certification
standards.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.100
More commonly today than ever
before,

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.783
we're seeing a variety of
different land use regulations

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:38.332
structured in a way that are
designed to reduce energy

00:09:38.332 --> 00:09:42.150
consumption or to guide it in a
way that produces less air

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.288
pollutions.
 

00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:47.327
So here's a suite of strategies
that might be used to control

00:09:47.327 --> 00:09:50.759
air quality in a variety of
different situations.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:54.846
So just a couple of quick
slides on key points relative to

00:09:54.846 --> 00:09:57.500
the structure of the Clean Air
Act.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.740
We have Air Quality Control
Regions.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.198
So each state has to set up a
designated area as either in

00:10:04.198 --> 00:10:06.860
attainment or at non-attainment.
 

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.198
And if you're in attainment,
you meet the National Ambient

00:10:11.198 --> 00:10:13.558
Air Quality Standards,
NAAQS.

00:10:13.558 --> 00:10:17.009
And states have to put together
state implementation plans.

00:10:17.009 --> 00:10:21.116
The idea being that states
would have a better capacity to

00:10:21.116 --> 00:10:24.360
know the behavior of sources of
emissions,

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:28.841
and it would have a better
ability to monitor what's going

00:10:28.841 --> 00:10:32.460
on and to enforce violations of
the statute.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.955
So the state implementation
plans have to have established

00:10:36.955 --> 00:10:39.952
enforceable limits,
methods for acquiring air

00:10:39.952 --> 00:10:41.988
quality data,
meaning that they've got to set

00:10:41.988 --> 00:10:43.058
up a surveillance system.
 

00:10:43.058 --> 00:10:47.230
Also, boundaries have to be
well identifiable.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.340
They have to set up an
enforcement program,

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.923
and also have to demonstrate
how they are controlling release

00:10:53.923 --> 00:10:56.908
of pollutants that could cross
state boundaries.

00:10:56.908 --> 00:11:00.059
And also, they have to set up
reporting requirements back to

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:02.090
the Environmental Protection
Agency.

00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.460
So what happens if a state
implementation plan fails?

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:08.416
I asked the question of the
head of the air quality division

00:11:08.416 --> 00:11:11.022
at the Department of
Environmental Protection who was

00:11:11.022 --> 00:11:14.028
responsible for Connecticut's
state implementation plan.

00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:16.644
And he said,
"Well, we could have our

00:11:16.644 --> 00:11:19.960
highway funds revoked or we
could have them seriously

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.298
diminished."
 

00:11:21.298 --> 00:11:22.898
I said, "Well,
how often does that

00:11:22.898 --> 00:11:23.528
happen?"
 

00:11:23.528 --> 00:11:26.162
Well, first I said,
"Well how often are you

00:11:26.162 --> 00:11:28.570
out of compliance with the
requirements,

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.894
the limits for the national
ambient standards or the

00:11:30.894 --> 00:11:32.399
hazardous air pollutants?"
 

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:34.139
And he said,
"Oh, quite often.

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:37.821
In fact, southern Connecticut
and especially in the New Haven

00:11:37.821 --> 00:11:41.501
region, is out of compliance for
ozone and particulate matter

00:11:41.501 --> 00:11:42.730
routinely."
 

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:46.313
And I said, "Well,
does that mean that the state

00:11:46.313 --> 00:11:50.037
has been forced to recommend to
EPA to restrict highway

00:11:50.037 --> 00:11:51.139
funds?"
 

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:52.731
And he looked at me and he
said, "Well now,

00:11:52.731 --> 00:11:54.019
we never really would do
that."

00:11:54.019 --> 00:11:56.538
And I said, "Does that
mean that EPA has never

00:11:56.538 --> 00:11:59.409
restricted or reduced highway
funds to the state?"

00:11:59.409 --> 00:12:01.110
And the answer was no.
 

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.562
So you've got a monitoring
burden, you've got an

00:12:04.562 --> 00:12:08.090
enforcement burden that really
is not working.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.509
So you've got primary and
secondary standards,

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:15.764
and the primary standards have
to be set to protect human

00:12:15.764 --> 00:12:16.600
health.
 

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.413
And the secondary standards are
set to protect environmental

00:12:19.413 --> 00:12:20.509
quality and property.
 

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:25.932
And you'll recall the effect of
acid precipitation on building

00:12:25.932 --> 00:12:27.889
stone as an example.
 

00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:30.480
Criteria pollutants are listed.
 

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.806
So that this is a listing
statute, just like the Safe

00:12:33.806 --> 00:12:35.149
Drinking Water Act.
 

00:12:35.149 --> 00:12:39.190
The analogy there would be the
maximum contaminant levels.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:41.178
But also the Endangered Species
Act.

00:12:41.178 --> 00:12:44.984
And because it is a statute
where the chemical has to be

00:12:44.984 --> 00:12:48.649
listed before it gets any
attention or is limited,

00:12:48.649 --> 00:12:52.203
then it has the same political
dynamics as those other two

00:12:52.203 --> 00:12:52.889
statutes.
 

00:12:52.889 --> 00:12:55.975
Everybody fights about which
chemical is going to be placed

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:56.720
on the list.
 

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:00.086
So there are also a class of
chemicals, about 190,

00:13:00.086 --> 00:13:03.038
that are called hazardous air
pollutants.

00:13:03.038 --> 00:13:06.889
And I'll go through these just
quickly.

00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:09.988
The criteria pollutants that
were initially believed to be

00:13:09.988 --> 00:13:12.379
dangerous to health include
particulates,

00:13:12.379 --> 00:13:14.500
SO_2,
NOx, carbon monoxide,

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.019
ozone, and lead.
 

00:13:17.019 --> 00:13:19.905
And by the way,
all of these chemicals are

00:13:19.905 --> 00:13:23.989
either emitted or they are
created from automobile exhaust,

00:13:23.989 --> 00:13:25.820
just this one example.
 

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.644
But then we have this other
category that's called hazardous

00:13:28.644 --> 00:13:29.460
air pollutants.
 

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:32.168
Asbestos, mercury,
arsenic, beryllium,

00:13:32.168 --> 00:13:35.455
vinyl chloride,
benzene, benzene is a known

00:13:35.455 --> 00:13:38.092
human carcinogen,
radionuclides,

00:13:38.092 --> 00:13:40.860
coke oven emissions,
and coal tars.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:46.943
So that there is this ambiguity
in language that's embedded into

00:13:46.943 --> 00:13:47.908
the act.
 

00:13:47.908 --> 00:13:50.857
Clearly, the criteria
pollutants are dangerous,

00:13:50.857 --> 00:13:52.139
they're hazardous.
 

00:13:52.139 --> 00:13:55.854
And the government has paid a
lot of attention to these six

00:13:55.854 --> 00:13:59.888
compounds and not much attention
to the hazardous air pollutants

00:13:59.888 --> 00:14:02.769
that include volatile organic
compounds,

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:08.379
some of which are ozone
precursors.

00:14:08.379 --> 00:14:09.919
So how are these standards set?
 

00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:10.830
What do they look like?
 

00:14:10.830 --> 00:14:13.945
Well it gets a big technical,
and I'm not going to spend much

00:14:13.945 --> 00:14:14.620
time on it.
 

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:19.317
But there's been an increasing
sensitivity about the danger of

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:22.399
particulate matter if it is
superfine.

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:25.259
So originally,
EPA went after particulate

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:29.049
matter ten, which is ten microns
in diameter, in size,

00:14:29.049 --> 00:14:32.340
and had neglected anything that
was finer.

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:36.830
So that eventually,
standards were set for PM 2.5.

00:14:36.830 --> 00:14:38.428
But take a look at the units
here.

00:14:38.428 --> 00:14:40.370
The units here are kind of
fascinating.

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:43.160
So just take PM 2.5,
because we're going be talking

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.730
about that with respect to
diesel emissions.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.287
Ninety percent of diesel
emissions are actually PM 1 or

00:14:49.287 --> 00:14:52.120
less, so that they are really
quite fine.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.063
So it's set at fifteen
micrograms per cubic meter,

00:14:55.063 --> 00:14:58.490
and it's hard to wrap your head
around what that means.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:03.572
Or sixty-five micrograms per
cubic meter, as a yearly

00:15:03.572 --> 00:15:04.548
average.
 

00:15:04.548 --> 00:15:06.210
And I'll come back to the
averaging issue.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:09.278
And for some of the pollutants
there's an annual average,

00:15:09.278 --> 00:15:12.019
for some pollutants there's
twenty-four average.

00:15:12.019 --> 00:15:14.340
And this is extremely important.
 

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.077
So there's a politic that
surrounds the averaging period

00:15:19.077 --> 00:15:21.058
that EPA has allowed.
 

00:15:21.058 --> 00:15:23.106
And by the way,
when EPA wants to establish a

00:15:23.106 --> 00:15:24.548
new limit, how do they do it?
 

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:27.028
Well, they publish a notice in
the federal register.

00:15:27.028 --> 00:15:31.126
How many of you have ever
commented on a Clean Air Act

00:15:31.126 --> 00:15:35.070
standards being proposed in the
federal register?

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:36.440
Really? You've done that?
 

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.480
Student:  Maybe if I had
any help from like Sierra Club

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.919
or something,
I'd do something like that.

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:41.058
Prof: Well that's great.
 

00:15:41.058 --> 00:15:45.304
You're the first student in
about ten years that's raised

00:15:45.304 --> 00:15:46.139
his hand.
 

00:15:46.139 --> 00:15:49.345
But very few people pay
attention to the federal

00:15:49.345 --> 00:15:53.370
register and very few people
have the capacity to comment in

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:57.190
a technical way that would be
potentially effective.

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.846
So here are the ozone
standards, the carbon monoxide

00:15:59.846 --> 00:16:02.763
standards and lead standards,
and they all have different

00:16:02.763 --> 00:16:03.908
averaging periods.
 

00:16:03.908 --> 00:16:06.158
Well, it's worth your
reflection on how those

00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:08.000
averaging periods are
established.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.727
And I'm not going to go into
that except with respect to PM

00:16:11.727 --> 00:16:12.500
2.5 today.
 

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.881
So the hazardous air pollutant
provisions were largely

00:16:15.881 --> 00:16:17.350
neglected by the EPA.
 

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:21.456
And Congress got upset in 1990
because only seven chemicals

00:16:21.456 --> 00:16:22.658
were regulated.
 

00:16:22.658 --> 00:16:27.230
By the way, there are six
national ambient standards set,

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:31.639
you know, PM and CO and lead
that I just showed you.

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:36.914
There were seven standards set
for hazardous air pollutants as

00:16:36.914 --> 00:16:37.779
of 1990.
 

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:39.620
And Congress said, "What?
 

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.149
This doesn't make any
sense."

00:16:41.149 --> 00:16:43.860
So how many air pollutants are
there, anyway?

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:47.811
Well, just in wood smoke is one
example, or tobacco smoke,

00:16:47.811 --> 00:16:51.485
there are between 2,000 and
4,000 different particles,

00:16:51.485 --> 00:16:53.149
different compounds.
 

00:16:53.149 --> 00:16:55.139
So particles of different size.
 

00:16:55.139 --> 00:17:00.201
So the attention of government
on so few compounds is really

00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:01.658
quite striking.
 

00:17:01.658 --> 00:17:03.778
So Congress said,
"What are you doing?

00:17:03.778 --> 00:17:05.750
What are you doing with the
hazardous air pollutants?"

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:08.220
And EPA said,
"Well, we've just been so

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:12.068
overwhelmed trying to figure how
to manage emissions from stacks.

00:17:12.068 --> 00:17:15.656
And we've had a hard time in
just dealing with six of the

00:17:15.656 --> 00:17:18.284
ambient standards,
so we haven't paid much

00:17:18.284 --> 00:17:19.950
attention to it."
 

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:24.768
So they established separate
categories in the amendments of

00:17:24.768 --> 00:17:25.338
1990.
 

00:17:25.338 --> 00:17:29.182
This set of amendments was
probably the most important set

00:17:29.182 --> 00:17:32.690
of amendments in the history of
the Clean Air Act.

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.651
And it categorized minor and
major sources and put into place

00:17:36.651 --> 00:17:40.150
the maximum achievable control
technology standard.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.558
Maximum achievable control
technology.

00:17:43.558 --> 00:17:46.000
So it basically is
forward-looking,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.710
thinking about the potential of
technology,

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.337
and in some instances,
setting standards that are

00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:55.058
beyond what technology could
meet.

00:17:55.058 --> 00:17:58.528
But offsets were also allowed
to reduce hazardous air

00:17:58.528 --> 00:18:00.328
pollutants within plants.
 

00:18:00.328 --> 00:18:02.980
And what that means is that if
you're a refinery,

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:07.740
say there's a huge refinery
with about a hundred different

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.502
stacks that exist between Los
Angeles and San Diego on the

00:18:12.502 --> 00:18:17.682
eastern side of the I-5 and it
has so many stacks coming out of

00:18:17.682 --> 00:18:22.108
it that those refineries and
other industries,

00:18:22.108 --> 00:18:23.990
large chemical companies,
went to EPA and said,

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:26.751
"Well look,
we don't want to have to meet

00:18:26.751 --> 00:18:28.838
these standards for every stack.
 

00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:33.071
For the ones where I'm emitting
lower levels than what would be

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:35.627
allowable,
can I use that as an offset for

00:18:35.627 --> 00:18:38.586
the emissions for the stack
that's emitting more than is

00:18:38.586 --> 00:18:39.608
allowable?"
 

00:18:39.608 --> 00:18:43.071
And this provision was enacted
to allow the companies to play a

00:18:43.071 --> 00:18:46.590
greater role in trying to figure
out how they could reduce their

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:47.818
overall emissions.
 

00:18:47.818 --> 00:18:50.483
Well, today for the next
twenty, twenty-five minutes,

00:18:50.483 --> 00:18:53.558
what I want to do is I want to
focus on vehicle emissions.

00:18:53.558 --> 00:18:57.211
Because it's extremely
important to our energy future

00:18:57.211 --> 00:19:00.442
and our climate future,
but it's also extremely

00:19:00.442 --> 00:19:02.410
important to our health.
 

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:07.018
It's affecting us quite
differentially based upon where

00:19:07.018 --> 00:19:11.200
we live, how we behave,
and also our ethnicity.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.598
And this is because different
ethnic groups have different

00:19:14.598 --> 00:19:16.269
background susceptibility.
 

00:19:16.269 --> 00:19:19.335
So all the principles that we
talked about with respect to

00:19:19.335 --> 00:19:21.538
pesticides and strontium-90
about gee,

00:19:21.538 --> 00:19:23.710
you know, not everybody's
exposed in the same way,

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:26.019
or not everybody is equally
vulnerable.

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:28.088
Or some people have background
illnesses.

00:19:28.088 --> 00:19:31.320
Well, this is a story in part
about the genetic susceptibility

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.182
of certain populations that have
a higher prevalence of

00:19:34.182 --> 00:19:36.088
respiratory illness than others.
 

00:19:36.088 --> 00:19:40.022
For example,
whites have a lower prevalence

00:19:40.022 --> 00:19:45.548
of asthma in the United States
than do African Americans.

00:19:45.548 --> 00:19:49.538
And people of Puerto Rican
descent have the highest in the

00:19:49.538 --> 00:19:50.170
nation.
 

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:53.088
So that's very difficult to
explain.

00:19:53.088 --> 00:19:57.356
It's difficult to tease out
whether or not there's a

00:19:57.356 --> 00:20:02.376
relationship between the smaller
ethnic groups and where they

00:20:02.376 --> 00:20:04.720
live inside urban areas.
 

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.744
There's a separate debate about
whether or not there's a genetic

00:20:08.744 --> 00:20:11.940
characteristic that makes them
more susceptible.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.288
So I want you to think about
the vehicle problem for a

00:20:15.288 --> 00:20:18.638
moment, which I think of as
enormously complicated and

00:20:18.638 --> 00:20:20.220
enormously important.
 

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.451
So that the way that we've been
managing our consumption of fuel

00:20:24.451 --> 00:20:28.413
and vehicles and the way that
we've used public subsidies to

00:20:28.413 --> 00:20:32.442
allow us to move more freely
round our landscape has had just

00:20:32.442 --> 00:20:35.130
an enormous effect on our
health,

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:38.683
our behavior,
as well as the quality of the

00:20:38.683 --> 00:20:39.868
environment.
 

00:20:39.868 --> 00:20:42.808
Two hundred and thirty-five
million vehicles in the U.S.,

00:20:42.808 --> 00:20:45.608
about 320 million people in the
U.S.,

00:20:45.608 --> 00:20:48.684
so that there's now one vehicle
in the country for everybody

00:20:48.684 --> 00:20:51.604
that has a driver's license or
is eligible for a driver's

00:20:51.604 --> 00:20:52.230
license.
 

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:58.000
So three trillion miles have
been traveled in the past year.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.364
Two hundred billion gallons of
fuel, 600 billion dollars per

00:21:01.364 --> 00:21:03.358
year at three dollars per
gallon.

00:21:03.358 --> 00:21:06.680
And the average fuel efficiency
of vehicles in the U.S.

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:09.150
is about seventeen miles per
gallon.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:13.566
Some of you are helping me with
a study of trucking and barging

00:21:13.566 --> 00:21:17.769
in an effort to try to think
about reducing diesel emissions

00:21:17.769 --> 00:21:20.958
from trucks,
tractor trailer trucks coming

00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:22.048
up ninety-five.
 

00:21:22.048 --> 00:21:27.125
Port Authority in New Jersey
receives about five million of

00:21:27.125 --> 00:21:32.640
the containers that come in on
barges to the Port Authority,

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:36.421
and make their way up into
Connecticut across the New York

00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:40.467
Border and move up toward Boston
and deliver goods in southern

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:43.345
Connecticut and Providence,
Rhode Island,

00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:45.029
and also in the Boston area.
 

00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:49.221
So that one of the issues that
we're looking at is could we do

00:21:49.221 --> 00:21:53.207
something that would employ
barges to move those containers

00:21:53.207 --> 00:21:57.123
so that it would avoid the
adverse effects associated with

00:21:57.123 --> 00:22:00.009
trucking moving through the
region,

00:22:00.009 --> 00:22:04.180
which is in part related to
their climate influence,

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.721
but also the really bad air
quality in Connecticut surrounds

00:22:08.721 --> 00:22:13.189
the I-95 corridor and the I-91
interchange moving up toward

00:22:13.189 --> 00:22:14.190
Hartford.
 

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.712
Those trucks,
by the way, get about five to

00:22:17.712 --> 00:22:20.650
five and a half miles per
gallon.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.140
How about the lag in adoption
of technology-forcing standards?

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:28.440
So say that you were the EPA
administrator and you decided

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:33.118
you wanted to do something about
this low-diameter particle and

00:22:33.118 --> 00:22:38.250
you published a regulation and
went through the comment period,

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.694
by the way, that is governed by
the Administrative Procedures

00:22:41.694 --> 00:22:42.038
Act.
 

00:22:42.038 --> 00:22:47.529
And you mandated a reduction in
say NOx and PM.

00:22:47.529 --> 00:22:52.260
In the case of particulate
matter and NOx,

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:58.722
this standard was proposed to
be adopted back in the late

00:22:58.722 --> 00:23:00.568
1990s, 1998.
 

00:23:00.568 --> 00:23:02.883
And eventually,
it was adopted following

00:23:02.883 --> 00:23:05.314
litigation and following the
Whitman v.

00:23:05.314 --> 00:23:08.278
American Trucker decision
went into force.

00:23:08.278 --> 00:23:13.800
But it didn't phase in to make
any changes until 2006 and 2010

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:17.058
in requirements for engine
design.

00:23:17.058 --> 00:23:21.095
So you need to think about kind
of the -- last night in section

00:23:21.095 --> 00:23:24.348
I said it's like the glacial
pace of regulation.

00:23:24.348 --> 00:23:27.834
So supposing the science is
really clear and it tells you

00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:31.628
that the current level of air
quality or current emissions are

00:23:31.628 --> 00:23:35.050
really dangerous and that
there's a link between disease

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:38.098
in the population and the
emission levels,

00:23:38.098 --> 00:23:39.650
and you want to do something
about it.

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:43.512
Well, it's going to take you
probably between ten and fifteen

00:23:43.512 --> 00:23:47.119
years to see any difference at
all in the regulations.

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:50.140
And what else is at play here?
 

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:53.240
What's the average life cycle
of a car?

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.868
Well now it's approaching
twenty years in the nation.

00:23:55.868 --> 00:23:58.134
And what's the average life
cycle of one of these

00:23:58.134 --> 00:23:59.220
long-distance trucks?
 

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.618
Well, that's getting close to
thirty years.

00:24:01.618 --> 00:24:04.048
For some of them it's even
thirty-five years.

00:24:04.048 --> 00:24:05.823
And by the way,
they don't throw those engines

00:24:05.823 --> 00:24:07.358
away at the end of thirty-five
years.

00:24:07.358 --> 00:24:11.228
They often move them into
agricultural purposes,

00:24:11.228 --> 00:24:15.756
or the last resort of use for
the least efficient diesel

00:24:15.756 --> 00:24:18.720
engine is now the fishing fleet.
 

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.180
So that old engines don't go
away.

00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:24.892
This tells you that just
adopting a new regulation that

00:24:24.892 --> 00:24:28.809
is technology forcing that is
going to demand a new engine

00:24:28.809 --> 00:24:32.032
design that will emit less,
it's not likely to make a

00:24:32.032 --> 00:24:33.630
difference for a long period of
time,

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:39.130
given this long life cycle of
the current vehicle stock.

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.558
Particulate standards.
 

00:24:40.558 --> 00:24:44.154
So they revised the standard,
I said '98 a minute ago,

00:24:44.154 --> 00:24:44.970
it's 1997.
 

00:24:44.970 --> 00:24:47.940
And it focused health concerns
on mortality studies.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.595
And basically,
they began to find that the

00:24:49.595 --> 00:24:51.088
finer particles are more
dangerous.

00:24:51.088 --> 00:24:52.929
And this, I mean,
thinking about it

00:24:52.929 --> 00:24:54.876
physiologically,
anybody that has had

00:24:54.876 --> 00:24:57.798
physiology, this should be quite
intuitive to you.

00:24:57.798 --> 00:25:04.160
So why would finer particles be
more dangerous?

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.288
Okay, yes?
 

00:25:06.288 --> 00:25:08.690
Student:  Absorbed
immediately in the bloodstream?

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.986
Prof: Well,
absorbed immediately into the

00:25:10.986 --> 00:25:11.670
bloodstream.
 

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.650
They are absorbed into the
bloodstream.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:18.726
But why would finer particles
be more easily absorbed than

00:25:18.726 --> 00:25:21.220
larger-diameter particles?
 

00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:24.694
Student:  I know also
that small particles can act as

00:25:24.694 --> 00:25:27.430
a nucleus and attract other--
Prof: Another good point.

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:30.173
These small carbon particles
act as a nucleus and they're

00:25:30.173 --> 00:25:32.769
sticky and they attract volatile
organic compounds.

00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:33.578
Yes.
 

00:25:33.578 --> 00:25:36.948
Student:  The small
particles can get through your

00:25:36.948 --> 00:25:40.135
body's natural defense
mechanisms in your nostrils and

00:25:40.135 --> 00:25:41.339
stuff like that.
 

00:25:41.339 --> 00:25:42.269
Prof: Okay.
 

00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:45.442
The larger particles are
filtered out higher up in the

00:25:45.442 --> 00:25:47.000
nasal pharyngeal cavity.
 

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.237
The smaller particles can be
embedded more deeply into your

00:25:51.237 --> 00:25:54.597
lung and they can carry,
therefore, these other

00:25:54.597 --> 00:25:56.788
compounds along with them.
 

00:25:56.788 --> 00:25:58.960
So the finer particles are more
dangerous.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.846
And we had started out with a
regulation of PM 10,

00:26:01.846 --> 00:26:03.910
went to the regulation of PM
2.5.

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:05.798
And now most people are
thinking, "Wow,

00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:08.548
diesel emissions are ninety
percent PM 1,

00:26:08.548 --> 00:26:13.019
why aren't we regulating at PM
1 or even lower than that?"

00:26:13.019 --> 00:26:15.269
In part, it's a detection
technology issue.

00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:18.048
It's more expensive to detect
the finer particles.

00:26:18.048 --> 00:26:22.201
More cumbersome for states to
try to set up a monitoring and

00:26:22.201 --> 00:26:23.818
surveillance program.
 

00:26:23.818 --> 00:26:25.788
So what are the latest PM
standards?

00:26:25.788 --> 00:26:27.798
Fifteen micrograms per cubic
meter.

00:26:27.798 --> 00:26:29.680
And I want you to focus on one
phrase here.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:34.090
These are daily averages and
they're then averaged over three

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:34.680
years.
 

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.279
Averaged over three years?
 

00:26:36.279 --> 00:26:37.390
Hm.
 

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:39.987
Well, when I first read that
and I hadn't really studied any

00:26:39.987 --> 00:26:42.328
of the science,
I said to myself, "Well,

00:26:42.328 --> 00:26:45.208
that must mean that the short
bursts of pollution really don't

00:26:45.208 --> 00:26:46.529
make any difference."
 

00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:50.151
I always thought that it was
not really a particularly good

00:26:50.151 --> 00:26:54.145
thing to hang out behind a truck
or a bus on the highway that was

00:26:54.145 --> 00:27:00.067
blowing diesel smoke,
and that there must be a better

00:27:00.067 --> 00:27:02.009
way to drive.
 

00:27:02.009 --> 00:27:05.526
So that in this case,
absolutely the opposite is

00:27:05.526 --> 00:27:06.048
true.
 

00:27:06.048 --> 00:27:08.140
The literature,
the scientific literature,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.131
if you do a careful scan,
it's very clear that even short

00:27:12.131 --> 00:27:15.837
bursts of pollution can have an
adverse effect on the

00:27:15.837 --> 00:27:19.759
respiration rate and also on
people that have background

00:27:19.759 --> 00:27:20.900
illnesses.
 

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.838
So if you look at the tunnel
studies,

00:27:22.838 --> 00:27:25.577
for example,
in Europe, in Switzerland in

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:27.683
Germany,
particularly through the Alps,

00:27:27.683 --> 00:27:30.436
where you have a lot of diesel
truck traffic that move through

00:27:30.436 --> 00:27:32.740
those tunnels,
and they're often backed up in

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.424
the tunnels so that the air
quality in those tunnels is

00:27:35.424 --> 00:27:36.470
exceptionally bad.
 

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.680
Well Lincoln Tunnel is another
good example of that.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:42.487
So that they found that people
were having respiratory

00:27:42.487 --> 00:27:45.624
symptoms,
using medication more often or

00:27:45.624 --> 00:27:50.249
had to visit the doctor or be
admitted to emergency rooms more

00:27:50.249 --> 00:27:54.038
often following these short
bursts of exposure.

00:27:54.038 --> 00:27:56.160
So the short bursts actually
count.

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.281
Read Whitman v.
 

00:27:57.281 --> 00:28:00.211
American Trucking,
it's a really interesting

00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:00.960
decision.
 

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:04.558
The Clean Air Act,
the Supreme Court concluded

00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:08.240
:unambiguously bars cost
consideration from the

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.038
standard-setting process."
 

00:28:11.038 --> 00:28:13.993
Further, it requires EPA to set
standards "requisite to

00:28:13.993 --> 00:28:16.897
protect the public health,"
"allowing an adequate

00:28:16.897 --> 00:28:18.250
margin of safety."
 

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:22.258
So this is not a case like the
early pesticide law of balancing

00:28:22.258 --> 00:28:23.808
risks versus benefits.
 

00:28:23.808 --> 00:28:28.958
No consideration of the cost to
the trucking industry or to the

00:28:28.958 --> 00:28:33.442
auto industry or to the
utilities can be at play as EPA

00:28:33.442 --> 00:28:37.180
decides what the level is
supposed to be.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:41.471
By the way, just the claim that
EPA had the responsibility to

00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:45.191
balance benefits caused this
implementation of the PM

00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:49.555
standard to be delayed for three
years while it was moving its

00:28:49.555 --> 00:28:51.630
way through the courts.
 

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:56.588
What about the health benefit
of the new PM standards?

00:28:56.588 --> 00:28:59.763
EPA estimated that when they
were fully implemented this

00:28:59.763 --> 00:29:00.630
year, hooray.
 

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.323
Okay, they decided in 1997 that
they wanted this new standard to

00:29:04.323 --> 00:29:05.318
protect health.
 

00:29:05.318 --> 00:29:08.980
So that it's fully implemented
this year.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:12.548
Eight thousand three hundred
fewer premature deaths were

00:29:12.548 --> 00:29:14.430
estimated to be the result.
 

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:18.640
Seventeen thousand fewer cases
of childhood acute bronchitis.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.750
And 360,000 fewer asthma
attacks.

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:23.538
Well, this is per year,
by the way.

00:29:23.538 --> 00:29:26.371
So EPA was estimating that
every year of delay in the

00:29:26.371 --> 00:29:29.910
implementation of this standard,
these are the health outcomes.

00:29:29.910 --> 00:29:32.328
Now, how would you cost that
out economically?

00:29:32.328 --> 00:29:35.779
Well how would you cost out say
asthma?

00:29:35.779 --> 00:29:40.314
What factors would you consider
in thinking about what the value

00:29:40.314 --> 00:29:44.489
to society might be if you
wanted to put this question into

00:29:44.489 --> 00:29:47.798
a more utilitarian cost-benefit
framework?

00:29:47.798 --> 00:29:51.284
Well, one of the things that
you would certainly consider

00:29:51.284 --> 00:29:54.519
would be the medical costs,
costs of medical care.

00:29:54.519 --> 00:29:56.578
So physician costs,
emergency room visits,

00:29:56.578 --> 00:30:00.744
and also you have to be aware
that those that are poorest in

00:30:00.744 --> 00:30:03.710
society have the least health
coverage,

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.190
and they tend to be the ones,
if they're asthmatic,

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.328
that don't get routine care.
 

00:30:08.328 --> 00:30:11.762
Severity of response is a
function of whether or not you

00:30:11.762 --> 00:30:12.950
get routine care.
 

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:16.961
And great studies about numbers
of doctor's visits related to

00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:19.170
numbers of hospital admissions.
 

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:21.579
So the more routine care you
get, the less likely you are to

00:30:21.579 --> 00:30:22.519
go into the hospital.
 

00:30:22.519 --> 00:30:26.946
So it costs society less,
especially for people that are

00:30:26.946 --> 00:30:29.038
on Medicaid or Medicare.
 

00:30:29.038 --> 00:30:33.759
So other costs that might be
considered could be trying to

00:30:33.759 --> 00:30:38.478
figure out how to bring your
child back up to speed in the

00:30:38.478 --> 00:30:43.364
classroom because asthma is
responsible for more lost school

00:30:43.364 --> 00:30:47.088
days than any other illness
among kids.

00:30:47.088 --> 00:30:50.666
Also, when a child stays home,
when my daughter gets sick,

00:30:50.666 --> 00:30:53.680
either my wife or I have to
stay home as well.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.108
So lost work days also should
be accounted.

00:30:56.108 --> 00:30:58.413
Had an interesting question
last night posed about,

00:30:58.413 --> 00:31:01.180
well what about the economic
benefit side of the equation?

00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:06.148
So should you also consider
some of the benefits of

00:31:06.148 --> 00:31:12.411
prescribing drugs or benefits to
a hospital of having the profit

00:31:12.411 --> 00:31:17.679
that's associated with use of
the drugs or the medical

00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:19.170
services?
 

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:21.776
So I mean, setting up the
accounting system,

00:31:21.776 --> 00:31:24.140
it's actually a very tricky
business.

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:27.134
Now, this problem of what's
coming out of vehicles has to be

00:31:27.134 --> 00:31:30.230
thought about in the context of
what else is being spewed into

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.838
the air.
 

00:31:30.838 --> 00:31:33.946
So small-diameter particles are
not just coming from vehicles,

00:31:33.946 --> 00:31:35.730
they're coming from power
plants.

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:40.190
So that this map of where the
coal-fired power plants are

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:42.578
located, this is an old map.
 

00:31:42.578 --> 00:31:45.935
But I'm using it just to make
the point that there are other

00:31:45.935 --> 00:31:49.348
sources of particle emission,
other sources of combustion.

00:31:49.348 --> 00:31:53.209
Forest fires in the Western
part of the United States,

00:31:53.209 --> 00:31:56.339
in California,
also produce similar kinds of

00:31:56.339 --> 00:31:57.358
particles.
 

00:31:57.358 --> 00:32:01.832
And so that the background
level of PM in the Northeastern

00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:04.500
United States is really serious.
 

00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.914
Other sources include right
here in New Haven,

00:32:08.914 --> 00:32:13.035
for example,
the tankers that come into the

00:32:13.035 --> 00:32:16.470
oil tank farm here in the port.
 

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:18.108
And why is that significant?
 

00:32:18.108 --> 00:32:21.569
Well, it's not as significant
here as it would be say in Long

00:32:21.569 --> 00:32:24.685
Beach or San Diego,
where you have a much higher

00:32:24.685 --> 00:32:29.083
intensity of shipment,
but these barges do tend to

00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:31.480
burn high-sulfur fuel.
 

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.744
So that we're now burning
sulfur fuel, diesel fuel,

00:32:35.744 --> 00:32:39.838
that's about fifteen parts per
million sulfur.

00:32:39.838 --> 00:32:42.900
That's the new mandate under
these new regulations.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.558
So the lower the sulfur
content, the lower the PM level.

00:32:46.558 --> 00:32:49.182
Now, however,
there are certain parts of the

00:32:49.182 --> 00:32:52.660
country that are allowed to burn
500 parts per million.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:57.334
And the military in Iraq is
allowed to burn 3,000 parts per

00:32:57.334 --> 00:32:58.140
million.
 

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:01.069
By the way, that's why if you
ever see like a convoy of the

00:33:01.069 --> 00:33:04.051
National Guard going down the
highway and you're behind them

00:33:04.051 --> 00:33:06.358
in a car,
it absolutely reeks.

00:33:06.358 --> 00:33:09.834
It's because they're burning
this 3,000 part per million

00:33:09.834 --> 00:33:11.724
fuel,
when your car or your diesel

00:33:11.724 --> 00:33:13.058
vehicle,
your diesel car,

00:33:13.058 --> 00:33:15.368
was burning only fifteen parts
per million.

00:33:15.368 --> 00:33:18.537
And there are parts of the
country where it's allowable to

00:33:18.537 --> 00:33:20.259
burn the higher-sulfur fuels.
 

00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:23.769
Surprisingly,
including some parts of Alaska.

00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:28.769
So think about where else these
particles are coming from.

00:33:28.769 --> 00:33:32.183
We also burn diesel fuel in
Connecticut especially because

00:33:32.183 --> 00:33:34.700
we don't have a good natural gas
source.

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:38.259
We burn it in our furnaces to
heat our houses.

00:33:38.259 --> 00:33:41.753
It's virtually the same kind of
fuel, except it's allowed to

00:33:41.753 --> 00:33:43.588
have a higher sulfur content.
 

00:33:43.588 --> 00:33:46.180
And also railroads along the
ninety-five.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:49.452
So the railroad corridor,
the highway corridor,

00:33:49.452 --> 00:33:52.442
on top of coal-fired power
plant emissions,

00:33:52.442 --> 00:33:56.569
on top of commercial emissions,
these are all sources.

00:33:56.569 --> 00:33:58.019
Yes, question.
 

00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:00.921
Student:  Is high-sulfur
content more efficient or

00:34:00.921 --> 00:34:01.440
cheaper?
 

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.140
&gt;
 

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:06.868
John Wargo:
 It's cheaper.

00:34:06.868 --> 00:34:10.559
So getting the sulfur out of
the fuel is a more expensive

00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:11.219
process.
 

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:13.842
Question was,
"Is high-sulfur fuel more

00:34:13.842 --> 00:34:15.429
or less expensive?"
 

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.250
And high-sulfur fuel is less
expensive.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:22.300
So it's a matter of the degree
of refinement of the fuel.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.367
So that in Connecticut,
I did a quick calculation and

00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:28.967
found that we're burning about
230 million gallons per year of

00:34:28.967 --> 00:34:30.619
diesel fuel in vehicles.
 

00:34:30.619 --> 00:34:34.150
But we're burning almost three
times that amount in houses,

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.429
in people's houses.
 

00:34:35.429 --> 00:34:37.695
And that has not been the
subject of regulation or

00:34:37.695 --> 00:34:39.130
attention on the part of EPA.
 

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.610
That is interesting to me.
 

00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:44.568
So that we're burning diesel
fuel right in the-- I'm burning

00:34:44.568 --> 00:34:47.320
diesel fuel in my basement in my
house.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.099
I'd better be sure that my
basement and my furnace are

00:34:51.099 --> 00:34:54.952
pretty well ventilated,
and not everybody takes care to

00:34:54.952 --> 00:34:58.018
monitor how efficient their
furnace is.

00:34:58.018 --> 00:35:00.373
They may let that go,
especially in tough economic

00:35:00.373 --> 00:35:01.239
times like this.
 

00:35:01.239 --> 00:35:05.708
But your exposure could be
really quite significant if you

00:35:05.708 --> 00:35:09.079
had a furnace that was out of
efficiency.

00:35:09.079 --> 00:35:12.510
So particle size definitions,
coarse is greater than 2.5,

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:15.280
fine is less than 2.5 but
greater than 0.1,

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.099
and ultrafine,
just so that you know,

00:35:17.099 --> 00:35:19.690
a little bit of air pollution
trivia.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:24.349
The diesel exhaust that you see
here is only PM 10.

00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:27.750
So PM 10 is just about the
limit of visibility,

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.976
which is kind of curious,
because most people think that

00:35:30.976 --> 00:35:34.380
diesel emissions are much
cleaner than they used to be,

00:35:34.380 --> 00:35:39.548
that somehow we've managed to
get rid of many of the smokers

00:35:39.548 --> 00:35:44.105
as EPA calls them with more
efficient designs or with

00:35:44.105 --> 00:35:45.768
particle traps.
 

00:35:45.768 --> 00:35:47.851
But in fact,
we're producing,

00:35:47.851 --> 00:35:51.420
yes, finer particles,
but we're producing more of

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.090
them.
 

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:56.384
So the idea that you have more,
finer particles that actually

00:35:56.384 --> 00:36:00.536
have greater surface area to
lock onto these other kinds of

00:36:00.536 --> 00:36:04.329
volatile compounds that I was
describing earlier.

00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:09.117
That is one hypothesis about
why we saw the rise in asthma in

00:36:09.117 --> 00:36:12.630
the nation during the 1980s and
the 1990s.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:16.599
So what is in diesel exhaust?
 

00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:20.525
What is at 2.5 basically is
elemental carbon,

00:36:20.525 --> 00:36:25.163
a smaller amount of organic
carbon, some sulfates and

00:36:25.163 --> 00:36:27.840
nitrates, and some metals.
 

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:28.619
Excuse me.
 

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:32.469
Going the wrong way.
 

00:36:32.469 --> 00:36:37.784
Here is a diagram that shows
particle size moving from ten

00:36:37.784 --> 00:36:42.539
part per million down to
one-hundredth of a part per

00:36:42.539 --> 00:36:45.710
million, or micron,
excuse me.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:49.817
And this is taken from Wilson
and Spangler on a book on indoor

00:36:49.817 --> 00:36:50.760
air quality.
 

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.188
So that you see the
larger-diameter particles are

00:36:54.188 --> 00:36:58.619
taken out pretty much by the
upper nasal pharyngeal cavity,

00:36:58.619 --> 00:37:03.505
whereas the lower particles do
tend to get more deeply embedded

00:37:03.505 --> 00:37:04.610
in the lung.
 

00:37:04.610 --> 00:37:07.889
So let me talk just for a few
minutes about asthma and asthma

00:37:07.889 --> 00:37:09.420
provenance in the country.
 

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:13.657
So about seven million kids now
have asthma, about twenty-two

00:37:13.657 --> 00:37:14.860
million adults.
 

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:17.789
It's the number one reason for
school absenteeism.

00:37:17.789 --> 00:37:21.094
And there are other critical
questions about what it means to

00:37:21.094 --> 00:37:24.231
have asthma, what the effects
are on academic performance,

00:37:24.231 --> 00:37:26.050
socialization and depression.
 

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.367
And I was teaching a seminar
here at the Yale-New Haven

00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:32.070
Teacher's Institute about seven
years ago.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:36.751
And I asked one of the people
in the class what the percentage

00:37:36.751 --> 00:37:41.358
of kids in his class was that
had registered medications with

00:37:41.358 --> 00:37:42.969
the school nurse.
 

00:37:42.969 --> 00:37:45.963
He said he didn't know,
but he came back and he said

00:37:45.963 --> 00:37:49.369
it's about twenty-four percent
of his kids in his class had

00:37:49.369 --> 00:37:52.070
been physician-diagnosed as
having asthma.

00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.820
I said, "Twenty-four
percent?

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:58.550
That's really extraordinary,
that's beyond epidemic."

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.481
So thinking about how this has
escaped public attention is

00:38:01.481 --> 00:38:02.869
really quite interesting.
 

00:38:02.869 --> 00:38:04.873
Mark Cullen,
who's now head of internal

00:38:04.873 --> 00:38:08.048
medicine at Stanford,
and I worked on an asthma

00:38:08.048 --> 00:38:12.860
report along with a group called
Environment and Human Health.

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:16.539
And when Mark was here in
internal medicine and headed up

00:38:16.539 --> 00:38:21.215
the Environmental Medicine unit,
we did a survey in Connecticut

00:38:21.215 --> 00:38:23.829
of asthma prevalence in schools.
 

00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:26.871
And we found it did range
between three and about

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:30.420
twenty-two percent school
district to school district.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:31.750
This is really quite striking.
 

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:35.327
We also found that the urban
schools had the highest

00:38:35.327 --> 00:38:36.659
prevalence rates.
 

00:38:36.659 --> 00:38:40.128
So we then thought about okay,
well what does this mean

00:38:40.128 --> 00:38:43.789
relative to what we were
thinking about in air quality?

00:38:43.789 --> 00:38:46.768
And this is an aside,
by the way.

00:38:46.768 --> 00:38:50.938
And I just wanted to show you
the picture of a slice of a lung

00:38:50.938 --> 00:38:55.039
tissue that demonstrates what
happens to the carbon when it's

00:38:55.039 --> 00:38:55.860
inhaled.
 

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.960
It doesn't just go away,
it doesn't just dissolve.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:38:59.929
It will sit in your lung.
 

00:38:59.929 --> 00:39:07.085
And I've talked to many of the
surgeons at Yale-New Haven who

00:39:07.085 --> 00:39:12.809
do sections and treat people
with lung cancer.

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:16.193
And I got into this because my
dad had lung cancer,

00:39:16.193 --> 00:39:19.711
and I was thinking about
different forms of treatment

00:39:19.711 --> 00:39:21.539
that he might consider.
 

00:39:21.539 --> 00:39:24.543
And I asked the question,
"Do you notice a

00:39:24.543 --> 00:39:28.329
difference between people that
live in New Haven and people

00:39:28.329 --> 00:39:30.706
that do not,
assuming that the two groups

00:39:30.706 --> 00:39:31.929
are both nonsmokers?"
 

00:39:31.929 --> 00:39:33.429
And he said, "Oh yes.
 

00:39:33.429 --> 00:39:34.210
You can tell.
 

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:35.340
You can tell by the grayness.
 

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:39.414
You can tell by the presence of
these carbon particles in the

00:39:39.414 --> 00:39:40.840
lung tissues."
 

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:45.697
They take certain sections of
the lung out for those that have

00:39:45.697 --> 00:39:47.530
operable lung cancer.
 

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:50.143
So then I started thinking
about what other kinds of

00:39:50.143 --> 00:39:52.862
background illnesses would make
one susceptible to air

00:39:52.862 --> 00:39:53.579
pollution?
 

00:39:53.579 --> 00:39:57.400
And they would be people that
were asthmatic,

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.280
kids and adults,
those with chronic bronchitis,

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.773
those with emphysema,
those with coronary heart

00:40:02.773 --> 00:40:04.018
disease and diabetes.
 

00:40:04.018 --> 00:40:06.130
And if you look on the
right-hand side of this chart,

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:10.610
you'll see that the number of
people in the United States

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:14.130
diagnosed with these different
illnesses,

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.880
and you see the numbers are
really quite striking.

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:20.224
And you might pause and say,
"Well what do diabetes and

00:40:20.224 --> 00:40:22.972
coronary heart disease--
" But this is very

00:40:22.972 --> 00:40:24.690
important to pay attention to.
 

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:28.309
So fifteen million people
diagnosed with coronary heart

00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:28.980
disease.
 

00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:32.297
Well, they found that diesel
emissions have the capacity to

00:40:32.297 --> 00:40:35.329
move through the bloodstream
once they're inhaled,

00:40:35.329 --> 00:40:38.577
to cross the blood-brain
barrier, and to move very widely

00:40:38.577 --> 00:40:39.679
through the body.
 

00:40:39.679 --> 00:40:43.090
And they also tend to slow down
blood flow.

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:46.389
They tend to act as a minor
coagulant.

00:40:46.389 --> 00:40:51.188
So that you can see an increase
in hospital admissions for

00:40:51.188 --> 00:40:55.230
coronary events following
pollution episodes,

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:58.791
particularly during the summer
months in the Northeastern

00:40:58.791 --> 00:40:59.809
United States.
 

00:40:59.809 --> 00:41:03.190
So I'm going to run out of time
in a few minutes.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.389
But I wanted to give you a
sense of how we understand air

00:41:06.389 --> 00:41:07.820
pollution in the state.
 

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:11.427
And we basically do this by the
monitoring system set up by the

00:41:11.427 --> 00:41:14.976
state implementation plan that
sets up these fixed monitors at

00:41:14.976 --> 00:41:16.139
different sites.
 

00:41:16.139 --> 00:41:18.969
So there's one right over on
State Street.

00:41:18.969 --> 00:41:22.422
There's one Stiles Street,
which is just across the Q

00:41:22.422 --> 00:41:23.018
Bridge.
 

00:41:23.018 --> 00:41:26.659
And you see that they are
capable of picking up different

00:41:26.659 --> 00:41:28.090
kinds of pollutants.
 

00:41:28.090 --> 00:41:32.329
The Stiles Street Station picks
up PM 2.5 and PM 10,

00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:35.730
another one in New Haven picks
up PM 2.5,

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:40.079
Madison Hammonasset State Park
picks up 0.03 down here on the

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:40.949
shoreline.
 

00:41:40.949 --> 00:41:42.670
And you might say, why Madison?
 

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:46.043
And actually Madison has some
of the highest reading in the

00:41:46.043 --> 00:41:47.090
state for Ozone.
 

00:41:47.090 --> 00:41:50.815
And it happens to be because
the rush-hour traffic in New

00:41:50.815 --> 00:41:55.139
York generally gets to this part
of Connecticut by about noon,

00:41:55.139 --> 00:41:57.050
when the sun is highest in the
sky.

00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:00.523
So you have the ozone
precursors coming in from New

00:42:00.523 --> 00:42:03.275
York,
taking maybe four or five hours

00:42:03.275 --> 00:42:07.481
after rush hour to get here,
and then you get the sunlight

00:42:07.481 --> 00:42:11.503
coming down and acting on them
in a way that produces the

00:42:11.503 --> 00:42:12.150
ozone.
 

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:17.085
So that the concept here is we
have about thirty different

00:42:17.085 --> 00:42:20.550
stations set up with fixed
monitoring.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:25.373
So what do the monitoring sites
tell us about pollution and how

00:42:25.373 --> 00:42:27.630
variable it is across time?
 

00:42:27.630 --> 00:42:31.802
So this is a day from midnight
to midnight going across the

00:42:31.802 --> 00:42:32.449
bottom.
 

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:35.398
And what you see here is
different months of the year

00:42:35.398 --> 00:42:37.949
represented by the different
colored lines.

00:42:37.949 --> 00:42:41.480
And over here,
you see the PM levels.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:47.992
And PM 2.5 has the standard of
fifteen microns as being the

00:42:47.992 --> 00:42:49.789
federal limit.
 

00:42:49.789 --> 00:42:51.639
That's when it's averaged over
a full day.

00:42:51.639 --> 00:42:55.739
And these estimates are
averaged over a day.

00:42:55.739 --> 00:42:58.797
And what you see here is that
some months are clearly dirtier

00:42:58.797 --> 00:43:00.018
than other months are.
 

00:43:00.018 --> 00:43:02.664
For example,
June tends to be,

00:43:02.664 --> 00:43:07.498
in this year at least,
June was more polluted than say

00:43:07.498 --> 00:43:09.050
December was.
 

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:12.389
So that there are certain
climatological patterns that are

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:13.210
behind this.
 

00:43:13.210 --> 00:43:16.648
But you also see something else
in this chart which I think is

00:43:16.648 --> 00:43:17.550
quite curious.
 

00:43:17.550 --> 00:43:19.719
You see this effect.
 

00:43:19.719 --> 00:43:22.369
You see a decline coming in the
early morning hours.

00:43:22.369 --> 00:43:27.489
You see a rise coming around
the rush hour.

00:43:27.489 --> 00:43:31.442
You see a decline that's more
in some months than others

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:35.969
coming back down for the lunch
hour and then picking back up.

00:43:35.969 --> 00:43:41.963
This is an artifact of the way
that we drive vehicles and how

00:43:41.963 --> 00:43:45.960
we're all at quite a similar
schedule.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.956
And I'm going to leave you
today with this diagram saying

00:43:48.956 --> 00:43:51.902
to you that you need to think
very carefully about these

00:43:51.902 --> 00:43:53.079
averaging periods.
 

00:43:53.079 --> 00:43:57.150
So I measure particles at
ten-second intervals.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:03.230
And they're represented by
these blue squares.

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:07.340
And if you take the same data
and you average that data over a

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.699
minute, you get the pink
squares.

00:44:09.699 --> 00:44:11.693
If you take a five-minute
moving average,

00:44:11.693 --> 00:44:12.739
you get the yellow.
 

00:44:12.739 --> 00:44:16.820
If you take a one-our average,
you get the purple.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.579
And you get the red if you
average it over eight hours.

00:44:19.579 --> 00:44:23.880
The PM 2.5 standard demands
that the data be averaged over

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:28.559
twenty-four hour periods and
then averaged over three years.

00:44:28.559 --> 00:44:31.567
So basically,
the way that EPA would read

00:44:31.567 --> 00:44:35.476
data would be over this
twenty-four hour average over

00:44:35.476 --> 00:44:36.679
three years.
 

00:44:36.679 --> 00:44:40.932
And you can tell from that that
it would compress everything so

00:44:40.932 --> 00:44:44.090
that all of these values would
be invisible.

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:47.030
Even if you had blocks of time,
like three, four hours,

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:49.210
were pollution was
exceptionally high.

00:44:49.210 --> 00:44:52.976
So when you put that story
together with the idea that

00:44:52.976 --> 00:44:57.525
scientific literature is telling
us that we need to pay attention

00:44:57.525 --> 00:45:00.369
to these short bursts of
pollution,

00:45:00.369 --> 00:45:05.106
predominately because people
are experiencing medical effects

00:45:05.106 --> 00:45:09.369
that are now causing them to
seek medical attention.

00:45:09.369 --> 00:45:10.079
Okay.
 

00:45:10.079 --> 00:45:10.969
That's it today.
 

00:45:10.969 --> 00:45:12.829
We'll come back on Thursday.
 

00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:18.000

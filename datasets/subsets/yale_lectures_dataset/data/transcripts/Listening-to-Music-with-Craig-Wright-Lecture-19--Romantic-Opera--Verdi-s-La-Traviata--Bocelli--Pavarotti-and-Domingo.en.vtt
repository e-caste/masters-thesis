00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.120
Prof: So good morning.
 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.136
Today we're going to be talking
about opera, particularly opera

00:00:06.136 --> 00:00:07.950
of the nineteenth century.
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.800
This is actually the third
opera that we have engaged in

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.140
our course, and it occurs to me
that I should ask you the names

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.610
of the other two.
 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.316
Can you remember any of the
other operas that we looked at,

00:00:21.316 --> 00:00:23.169
albeit briefly,
in this class?

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.000
Thaddeus.
 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.830
Student: Don
Giovanni.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:26.597
Prof: Don
Giovanni,

00:00:26.597 --> 00:00:27.260
by Mozart.
 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.367
That was the one we had a run
at acting out particular scenes

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:31.710
of.
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.470
We enjoyed it.
 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.866
And what was the other one,
an earlier one that we heard at

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.610
least an aria out of?
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.170
Is it Leah? Leah, please.
 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.730
Student: Dido and
Aeneas.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.937
Prof: Dido and
Aeneas of Henry Purcell,

00:00:43.937 --> 00:00:45.890
taking us back into the
seventeenth century.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.100
So we had a seventeenth-century
opera, an eighteenth-century

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.400
opera.
 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.500
Now we come to a
nineteenth-century opera.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.393
Nineteenth-century opera,
as you may know if you've

00:00:54.393 --> 00:00:56.650
peeked there in chapters
twenty-six,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.643
twenty-seven,
and twenty-eight of your

00:00:58.643 --> 00:01:01.999
textbook,
concerns two figures in

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.722
particular: one,
Richard Wagner and the other,

00:01:06.722 --> 00:01:08.159
Giuseppe Verdi.
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.599
Now we've had some music of
Wagner before.

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:14.918
What was the big aria that we
dealt with out of his opera

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:16.230
Tristan?
 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.159
Remember that?
 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.580
What was that?
 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.959
It had an interesting name.
 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:20.920
Thaddeus again.
 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.840
Student: The
Liebestod.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.569
Prof: The
Liebestod--the

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:25.299
Liebestod of Richard
Wagner.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.629
But we've had some Wagner here
in our course.

00:01:29.629 --> 00:01:32.390
We've had no Verdi and I think
it's--

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.571
it is probably wiser to focus
on Verdi because Verdi in a way

00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:42.235
is much more representative of
nineteenth-century opera

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.739
generally than is Wagner.
 

00:01:44.739 --> 00:01:47.789
Wagner is a very special kind
of thing that gets put on only

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.931
in--
usually only in Wagner

00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:53.688
festivals, whereas Verdi,
in an odd way--Verdi and Mozart

00:01:53.688 --> 00:01:56.849
and Puccini--
are sort of the staples of most

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:59.569
opera companies around the
world.

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.465
Last night I went online just
to see what was happening with

00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:06.307
Italian opera--Verdi,
and particularly La

00:02:06.307 --> 00:02:07.430
Traviata.
 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.901
And immediately,
of course, the first thing you

00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:13.235
get on any kind of Google search
is somebody trying to sell you

00:02:13.235 --> 00:02:14.580
tickets to something.
 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.538
But I was just interested at
how many opera houses around the

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:22.628
world you could buy tickets for
La Traviata tonight,

00:02:22.628 --> 00:02:23.970
tomorrow night,
or the next night.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.229
And it turns out that there are
five opera houses in the United

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:30.068
States playing La
Traviata Thursday evening--

00:02:30.068 --> 00:02:32.310
one of them at the Metropolitan
Opera.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.068
So this gives you a sense of
hey, this is really popular;

00:02:36.068 --> 00:02:39.110
this is what opera companies
are really working with.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.359
So we're going to focus on
Giuseppe Verdi here and

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:42.919
particularly La Traviata.
 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.538
Verdi is an interesting case.
 

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:47.074
We've dealt with lots of
musical prodigies,

00:02:47.074 --> 00:02:49.065
such as Mozart,
and in an odd way,

00:02:49.065 --> 00:02:52.504
Verdi at the beginning of his
career was an abject musical

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:53.348
failure.
 

00:02:53.348 --> 00:02:56.206
He tried to get into--he
applied for admission to the

00:02:56.206 --> 00:02:58.460
Conservatory of Milan and was
rejected.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.149
He tried to get a job as the
director of music at his small

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:08.001
farming community of Busetto in
northern Italy near Parma and

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:10.669
was turned down for that job.
 

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:12.949
So he got a job as the town
bandmaster,

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:16.574
ultimately, but he was--he
persevered and he continued to

00:03:16.574 --> 00:03:20.757
write operas,
and then eventually he got one

00:03:20.757 --> 00:03:23.169
performed at La Scala.
 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.990
Now, La Scala is the main opera
house in Milan.

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.348
So that was successful.
 

00:03:28.348 --> 00:03:32.669
And on the basis of that
success, then impresarios--

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:36.919
producers around the
world--contacted Verdi and tried

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.250
to convince him to write operas
for their theaters.

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.388
And he did, and eventually his
career spread even to North

00:03:44.388 --> 00:03:45.930
America and South America.
 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.295
So let's take a moment and look
at the operas that Verdi

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:49.970
composed.
 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:51.400
You have a list over there.
 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.841
Put Nabucco on because
that's the one that launched his

00:03:55.841 --> 00:03:59.410
career, really,
in Milan in eighteen forty-two.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.774
Then we have a series there in
the middle: Rigoletto,

00:04:02.774 --> 00:04:05.169
Il Trovatore,
La Traviata.

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:10.093
These are sometimes called his
more "domestic"

00:04:10.093 --> 00:04:14.930
type of opera subjects--rather
than historical ones.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.040
Then we move on to later works.
 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.069
You can see Don Carlos
there, another historical one;

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:23.343
Aida,
for the opening of the Suez

00:04:23.343 --> 00:04:24.598
Canal;
Otello;

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.976
and Falstaff based off
of the--I guess "The Merry

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.439
Wives of Windsor."
 

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:32.497
So you can see a couple of
points here: one,

00:04:32.497 --> 00:04:36.482
that Verdi lived a long time
and was active as a creative

00:04:36.482 --> 00:04:39.470
artist for a very long period of
time.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.970
Any other artist has a longer
productive career than Verdi?

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.940
There is one painter working in
the twentieth century.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.379
Think about it a minute.
 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:50.559
Picasso, yeah,
from about 1905 until really

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:54.420
the time of his death in the
early 1970s I guess.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.353
So he was productive,
in the case of Verdi,

00:04:57.353 --> 00:04:59.589
for five or six decades there.
 

00:04:59.589 --> 00:05:01.942
And notice also the importance
of Shakespeare here,

00:05:01.942 --> 00:05:03.449
lots of Shakespearian setting.
 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:07.069
Shakespeare was the dominant
literary figure of the

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:08.588
nineteenth century.
 

00:05:08.588 --> 00:05:11.990
So let's turn our attention now
to La Traviata.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.331
It's based on a play of
Alexander Dumas,

00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:18.759
Alexandre Dumas--fils
actually.

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:21.720
PÃ¨re happens to
be on the cover of our textbook.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.007
The son wrote a play called
"The Lady of the

00:05:25.007 --> 00:05:26.240
Camellias."
 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.970
Camellia is a white flower.
 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:35.620
And the play was simply staging
a true-life story involving this

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.608
playwright,
Alexandre Dumas the younger,

00:05:39.608 --> 00:05:43.779
and his love affair with a
young lady named Marie du

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:44.680
Plessis.
 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.997
You have a picture of Marie
Duplessis in page--on page 302

00:05:49.997 --> 00:05:51.769
of your textbook.
 

00:05:51.769 --> 00:05:54.800
She was a girl from the country
who,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.666
by a liberal allocation of
charm, and an even more generous

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:04.449
distribution of her virtue
managed to sleep her way to the

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.889
top of Parisian society at that
time.

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:09.000
I was trying to think this
morning.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.456
I don't know very much about
popular culture,

00:06:11.456 --> 00:06:13.410
but who would be like that
today?

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.649
I don't know.
 

00:06:14.649 --> 00:06:17.300
I--Paris Hilton,
people like--I don't know,

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:22.744
but she was kind of the tabloid
figure of the nineteenth century

00:06:22.744 --> 00:06:27.100
so much so that I was struck--
I came upon this recently.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.733
Charles Dickens--and you don't
think of Dickens and Paris

00:06:30.733 --> 00:06:34.497
Hilton in the same sentence
normally but Charles Dickens in

00:06:34.497 --> 00:06:37.807
faraway England at this time
noticed that when Marie

00:06:37.807 --> 00:06:41.149
Duplessis died in Paris--
and she died at the shockingly

00:06:41.149 --> 00:06:43.449
young age of twenty-three--
when she died,

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.610
Dickens said the following:
"You would have thought

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.226
her passing was a question of
life and death or the death of a

00:06:52.226 --> 00:06:54.949
hero such as Joan of Arc."
 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:07:00.910
So, obviously again sort of
capturing everyone's attention.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.771
In any event,
we're going to watch La

00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:05.680
Traviata on a video.
 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.425
And that video will be on
reserve for you and you've got

00:07:09.425 --> 00:07:13.240
some hints about that on that
flip side of your sheet.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.689
Everybody got the sheet for
today?

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:15.759
It says "Opera News."
 

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:20.908
You're going to be watching a
video and you'll see there that

00:07:20.908 --> 00:07:24.339
the scene is set in Paris about
1845,

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:30.067
so this is core romantic time,
a core romantic place:

00:07:30.067 --> 00:07:31.610
Paris, 1845.
 

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.220
La Traviata--what does
that mean?

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.149
Well, if you break it down in
terms of its syllables you get

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:38.589
the following:
"La,"

00:07:38.589 --> 00:07:40.982
feminine article I guess,
"tra,"

00:07:40.982 --> 00:07:44.399
on the other side of,
"via" is a road,

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:46.490
"ta"
is a feminine thing,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.471
so we have the woman that's
sort of fallen off the beaten

00:07:50.471 --> 00:07:53.180
path,
or the expected road here.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.180
She's the woman who has gone
astray.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.007
She is a kept woman,
a courtesan,

00:07:59.007 --> 00:08:02.454
if you will,
a sort of high-class hooker

00:08:02.454 --> 00:08:07.228
here, and at the moment,
she is under the protection of

00:08:07.228 --> 00:08:09.350
one Baron Douphol.
 

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:14.180
He's the bad guy in our opera,
the bad guy on our video.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:16.490
The opera opens at a party.
 

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:18.490
In comes our hero.
 

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:20.819
His name is Alfredo.
 

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:24.661
So the love couple here,
the love interests:

00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:26.360
Alfredo-Violetta.
 

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.860
Violetta is the woman gone
astray.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.690
So Alfredo comes in and he
proposes a toast.

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.575
So we're going to listen to a
little bit of our first music

00:08:36.575 --> 00:08:37.580
this morning.
 

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.337
I will probably be breaking up
this music and commenting more

00:08:41.337 --> 00:08:44.470
than I normally would,
for reasons of copyright.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.371
I needn't say more or go into
that more than that,

00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:50.807
but I'm gonna break it up a
little bit more than I normally

00:08:50.807 --> 00:08:51.399
would.
 

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:54.345
So let's listen to a little bit
and think about here--think of

00:08:54.345 --> 00:08:57.048
the meter, think of the mode as
we listen to this opening

00:08:57.048 --> 00:08:57.580
chorus.
 

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:22.259
&gt;
 

00:09:22.259 --> 00:09:22.548
Okay.
 

00:09:22.548 --> 00:09:24.808
Let's just pause it here for a
second.

00:09:24.808 --> 00:09:25.880
You have the text.
 

00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.904
It's the opening
thing--aria--here,

00:09:27.904 --> 00:09:28.558
Alfredo.
 

00:09:28.558 --> 00:09:31.264
At the top there,
waltz and drinking song,

00:09:31.264 --> 00:09:33.442
"Libiamo,"
let us drink,

00:09:33.442 --> 00:09:35.289
let us drink,
and so on;

00:09:35.289 --> 00:09:36.230
let's have a good time.
 

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:38.279
What about the mode and the
meter?

00:09:38.279 --> 00:09:39.639
Basic question.
 

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:43.518
Well, if it's a waltz it's got
to be triple.

00:09:43.518 --> 00:09:44.149
Okay.
 

00:09:44.149 --> 00:09:48.690
So we have a fast triple,
&gt;

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.419
and the mode, major or minor?
 

00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:54.029
Minor?
 

00:09:54.029 --> 00:09:55.830
Let's listen to some more.
 

00:09:55.830 --> 00:10:11.320
&gt;
 

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.860
What about that chord?
 

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.940
Major or minor?
 

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.528
So it's all in major.
 

00:10:16.528 --> 00:10:20.573
So we have a happy,
joyful sort of crowd scene read

00:10:20.573 --> 00:10:22.028
by Alfredo here.
 

00:10:22.028 --> 00:10:26.328
Then he steps forward to
announce his--to profess his

00:10:26.328 --> 00:10:27.899
love to Violetta.
 

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:31.918
He's been admiring her from
afar, and we have the first

00:10:31.918 --> 00:10:33.259
major aria here.
 

00:10:33.259 --> 00:10:37.245
You have your sheet and you can
see the arrow pointing to it,

00:10:37.245 --> 00:10:39.038
"Un Di Felice."
 

00:10:39.038 --> 00:10:45.109
And let's listen to a bit of
this now and the same question

00:10:45.109 --> 00:10:49.399
to you: the mode and the meter
of this.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.354
We'll listen to a little bit of
it and then we'll talk about

00:10:52.354 --> 00:10:54.957
tempo here so let's pay
particular attention to tempo

00:10:54.957 --> 00:10:55.659
and meter.
 

00:10:55.659 --> 00:10:58.919
&gt;
 

00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:12.809
 
 

00:11:12.809 --> 00:11:15.149
Here we go.
 

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:17.789
&gt;
 

00:11:17.789 --> 00:11:19.700
Can you conduct it?
 

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:22.320
Where's the beat?
 

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.250
&gt;
 

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.029
Good.
 

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:26.240
Evgeny's got it.
 

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.948
Stand up and conduct for
everyone--no,

00:11:28.948 --> 00:11:32.830
don't stand up but a nice,
big beat for--very good.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:33.029
&gt;
 

00:11:33.029 --> 00:11:33.482
Okay.
 

00:11:33.482 --> 00:11:35.480
&gt;
 

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.570
All right.
 

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:40.413
So we've got a nice,
slow triple meter here and what

00:11:40.413 --> 00:11:45.235
about the--it's mostly major but
sort of tinged a little bit with

00:11:45.235 --> 00:11:45.990
minor.
 

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.360
Let's watch what happens to the
tempo now.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.014
We're kind of one,
two, three, one,

00:11:52.014 --> 00:11:53.029
two, three.
 

00:11:53.029 --> 00:11:54.279
A little bit more.
 

00:11:54.279 --> 00:12:13.480
&gt;
 

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:13.625
Okay.
 

00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:14.620
So we're going to pause it
there.

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:15.850
So what happened?
 

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:18.269
Well, obviously the tempo
slowed way, way down there.

00:12:18.269 --> 00:12:22.509
And we have this term for
this--it's part and parcel of

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:25.772
the romantic era--
called tempo rubato,

00:12:25.772 --> 00:12:29.110
flexibility,
more unstable tempos here,

00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:34.317
again part of the instability
in a way and the mercurial

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:39.808
switches back and forth of mood
of the romantic period.

00:12:39.808 --> 00:12:41.493
"Tempo rubato"
literally means

00:12:41.493 --> 00:12:42.399
"robbed."
 

00:12:42.399 --> 00:12:43.724
"Rubato"
means "robbed,"

00:12:43.724 --> 00:12:44.679
"something robbed."
 

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:45.710
Well, here the tempo is robbed.
 

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.288
We're taking away.
 

00:12:47.288 --> 00:12:49.885
We're slowing it way down here
and then it will speed back up

00:12:49.885 --> 00:12:52.048
to catch back up,
so it's kind of like a Slinky.

00:12:52.048 --> 00:12:55.067
Remember the Slinky you had as
a kid that you'd put on the step

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:58.279
and it'd go really fast and then
slow and then all over the top.

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:00.918
And so that's what--sort of
what tempo rubato is.

00:13:00.918 --> 00:13:02.500
So let's listen to a little bit
more.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:14.950
&gt;
 

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.278
Here's a shift to minor
&gt;

00:13:18.278 --> 00:13:27.234
and the word
"mystery,"

00:13:27.234 --> 00:13:35.908
&gt;
 

00:13:35.908 --> 00:13:39.830
more rubato there,
slowed it way down.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.408
&gt;
 

00:13:41.408 --> 00:13:41.687
Okay.
 

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.850
Let's pause it here just for a
second.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:45.200
Now Violetta's going to come in.
 

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.447
And I would ask you,
"How does Violetta's music

00:13:48.447 --> 00:13:51.058
differ from the music of
Alfredo?"

00:13:51.058 --> 00:13:53.840
You ought to be to think of a
couple of ways here.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:54.789
Let's listen to Violetta.
 

00:13:54.789 --> 00:14:06.169
&gt;
 

00:14:06.169 --> 00:14:08.320
Okay. So we'll pause it there.
 

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.169
So how does that music differ
from what we've just heard?

00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:11.240
Anybody?
 

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.809
 
 

00:14:12.809 --> 00:14:14.899
Jerry.
 

00:14:14.899 --> 00:14:15.210
Student: It's faster.
 

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:16.293
Prof: It's faster.
 

00:14:16.293 --> 00:14:16.727
All right.
 

00:14:16.727 --> 00:14:17.509
Take the basics.
 

00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.980
It's faster.
 

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.129
What did you sense about it?
 

00:14:20.129 --> 00:14:21.429
Darker or lighter?
 

00:14:21.429 --> 00:14:24.629
Probably lighter.
 

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:27.692
It's--and it's higher in range
and it's a little bit flighty

00:14:27.692 --> 00:14:28.990
and it's more disjunct.
 

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:31.990
And this is what composers do.
 

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:33.519
They try to depict characters.
 

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:36.532
So right off the bat we have
this kind of live-for-the-moment

00:14:36.532 --> 00:14:38.190
character, Violetta,
coming in.

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:41.422
She doesn't want to have
anything to do with this mystery

00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.788
of love that Alfredo is
proposing here.

00:14:43.788 --> 00:14:48.283
And this is what Verdi was good
at and this is what Mozart was

00:14:48.283 --> 00:14:49.389
very good at.
 

00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:52.006
One of the things we should
have noticed about that lovely

00:14:52.006 --> 00:14:54.580
duet that Richard Lalli and
Lynda sang the other day,

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.639
"La Ci Darem La
Mano," was that,

00:14:57.639 --> 00:15:00.825
as they were singing,
Mozart was writing music in

00:15:00.825 --> 00:15:04.143
which there were rests in
between each entry of the

00:15:04.143 --> 00:15:04.940
singers.
 

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.778
And then as that duet went
on--and we didn't even notice,

00:15:07.778 --> 00:15:11.710
but it's crucial to the effect
of the duet--

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:15.695
as the duet went on the length
of those rests got smaller and

00:15:15.695 --> 00:15:16.360
smaller.
 

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.730
And eventually they disappeared.
 

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:25.538
And what Mozart is telling us
here is that just as physical--

00:15:25.538 --> 00:15:30.470
as sonic space is disappearing,
so too the distance between

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.870
these two individuals is
disappearing.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:37.549
They're getting closer together
musically as they're getting

00:15:37.549 --> 00:15:39.360
closer together physically.
 

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:49.480
And then it ended up with
&gt;

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.331
right together in parallel
thirds there so Mozart brings

00:15:52.331 --> 00:15:53.679
this music all together.
 

00:15:53.679 --> 00:15:55.500
Well, watch what happens here.
 

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:56.548
Who's going to win out?
 

00:15:56.548 --> 00:15:59.029
Is Violetta's light music going
to win out?

00:15:59.029 --> 00:16:01.950
Is Alfredo going to start
singing like Violetta or is

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:04.590
Violetta going to start singing
like Alfredo?

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:05.860
Let's listen a bit more.
 

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:39.418
&gt;
 

00:16:39.418 --> 00:16:39.697
Okay.
 

00:16:39.697 --> 00:16:41.259
Let's pause it right there.
 

00:16:41.259 --> 00:16:42.200
So who won?
 

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.110
Who got his or her way?
 

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.480
Roger.
 

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.299
Student: Alfredo.
 

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:50.620
Prof: Alfredo, right.
 

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.190
So she came down in her range.
 

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.389
She shifted to a slightly
minor-tinted sound and then the

00:16:56.389 --> 00:17:00.514
tempo of the music slowed down
so he won that contest of

00:17:00.514 --> 00:17:04.490
musical wills there or musical
characterizations.

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.730
So we're going to listen to a
little bit more of this,

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:09.948
and now we want to shift our
attention over to the issue of

00:17:09.948 --> 00:17:13.000
the relationship between the
voice and the orchestra.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.720
And this is very different from
what happens in Wagner.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.377
So we're listening here to a
typical setup of Verdi,

00:17:18.377 --> 00:17:21.608
and what is the relationship of
the voice and the orchestra?

00:17:21.608 --> 00:17:23.309
What is the orchestra doing
here?

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:49.180
&gt;
 

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:50.779
Okay. Let's pause here.
 

00:17:50.779 --> 00:17:56.019
What's the orchestra doing?
 

00:17:56.019 --> 00:17:57.680
&gt;
 

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.394
, a little sort of pizzicato
support underneath,

00:18:01.394 --> 00:18:02.740
not much more.
 

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.818
Let's listen to a bit more here
and see what the orchestra is

00:18:05.818 --> 00:18:06.230
doing.
 

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:29.480
&gt;
 

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:30.221
Let's pause it here.
 

00:18:30.221 --> 00:18:31.259
What's the orchestra doing?
 

00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:34.150
Absolutely nuttin'.
 

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.000
It's disappearing completely.
 

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.858
What is this? What's going on?
 

00:18:38.858 --> 00:18:42.247
Well, this is the period--the
great period--of bel

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:43.548
canto singing.
 

00:18:43.548 --> 00:18:45.493
Literally, "bel
canto" just means

00:18:45.493 --> 00:18:47.669
"beautiful song,"
"beautiful song

00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:49.660
singing,"
where all of the attention is

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.910
focused on the voice.
 

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.779
That's what the audience is
paying to hear.

00:18:52.779 --> 00:18:54.288
They don't care.
 

00:18:54.288 --> 00:18:57.770
You almost get an amplified
guitar underneath there and play

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.838
that accompaniment so it's all
in the voices here.

00:19:00.838 --> 00:19:04.786
And again it's very different
than the orchestrally dominated

00:19:04.786 --> 00:19:05.970
score of Wagner.
 

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:08.640
So let's listen to the end of
this aria, voices alone.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:37.288
&gt;
 

00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:37.625
Okay.
 

00:19:37.625 --> 00:19:40.240
So that's the first big aria
together;

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.230
indeed it's a duet.
 

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.163
Now we're going on--to move on
here in La Traviata to

00:19:45.163 --> 00:19:47.430
something called a scena.
 

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:50.753
And a scena--the Italian
word "scena"

00:19:50.753 --> 00:19:53.011
of course is simply
"scene"

00:19:53.011 --> 00:19:56.650
but in opera it's a little bit
more complex than that.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:03.670
What we have is an amalgam of
three items.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:08.355
We have an aria followed by a
recitative followed by another

00:20:08.355 --> 00:20:12.170
aria, and that final aria is a
very fast aria.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:14.953
Indeed it's something called a
cabaletta,

00:20:14.953 --> 00:20:16.910
that we'll talk about later on.
 

00:20:16.910 --> 00:20:22.471
So now we're moving on our text
sheet here to the second arrow,

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:26.150
where we have an aria sung by
Violetta.

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:30.218
She's saying to herself--she's
off by herself--"Ah,

00:20:30.218 --> 00:20:34.140
perhaps he is the one that I
have been waiting for.

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:37.279
Maybe this is finally the great
true love of my life."

00:20:37.279 --> 00:20:38.740
Let's listen to a little bit of
this.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:21:10.990
&gt;
 

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.828
All right. We'll stop there.
 

00:21:12.828 --> 00:21:15.626
Obviously, this is an aria
because there's so much

00:21:15.626 --> 00:21:17.740
attention on just producing
sound,

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:19.528
sliding all the way up to that
high note,

00:21:19.528 --> 00:21:22.308
and it happens to be in a minor
key.

00:21:22.308 --> 00:21:25.144
Then she begins to reflect
further on this and she says,

00:21:25.144 --> 00:21:26.019
"Well, no.
 

00:21:26.019 --> 00:21:27.309
This is not what I want to do.
 

00:21:27.309 --> 00:21:29.200
Think about my situation here.
 

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:31.568
Here I am in Paris,
alone and abandoned."

00:21:31.568 --> 00:21:35.147
We're going to go on to the
next arrow here down a little

00:21:35.147 --> 00:21:39.355
bit below: "Folia,
folio, delirio e vanno e questo

00:21:39.355 --> 00:21:43.068
povera donna"--
"Poor Lady"--

00:21:43.068 --> 00:21:45.960
"Solo, abbandonata in
questo..."

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:53.349
&lt;&lt;quotes in
Italian&gt;&gt;

00:21:53.349 --> 00:21:54.298
"What am I going to do?
 

00:21:54.298 --> 00:21:55.838
Well, I'm going to enjoy
myself."

00:21:55.838 --> 00:21:59.682
So what we have here is a
recitative, but it's a different

00:21:59.682 --> 00:22:03.458
kind of recitative than we've
had up to this point in our

00:22:03.458 --> 00:22:04.200
course.
 

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.262
Up to this point,
we've had recitative called

00:22:06.262 --> 00:22:08.981
"simple recitative"
and this is the recitative of

00:22:08.981 --> 00:22:11.278
the seventeenth and eighteenth
century that--

00:22:11.278 --> 00:22:14.015
in which the particular
protagonist would be going along

00:22:14.015 --> 00:22:16.950
and trying to relate what is
happening at that time and then

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.288
would come to the end of a
section &lt;&lt;plays

00:22:19.288 --> 00:22:19.934
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:22:19.934 --> 00:22:22.471
, something like that,
and would be accompanied only

00:22:22.471 --> 00:22:24.808
very lightly by a keyboard
underneath.

00:22:24.808 --> 00:22:27.470
And that--that's kind of all
that's accompanied.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:30.454
But now we move on to a bigger
kind of accompanying,

00:22:30.454 --> 00:22:32.680
orchestrally accompanied
recitative.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:36.237
It's got this fancy
Italian-sounding word,

00:22:36.237 --> 00:22:39.098
recitativo accompagnato.
 

00:22:39.098 --> 00:22:41.375
We could pronounce it that way
or just say "accompanied

00:22:41.375 --> 00:22:42.109
recitative."
 

00:22:42.109 --> 00:22:44.328
It's the same deal.
 

00:22:44.328 --> 00:22:48.651
You get the full orchestra
accompanying rather than just

00:22:48.651 --> 00:22:49.828
the keyboard.
 

00:22:49.828 --> 00:22:53.125
So let's listen to a good
example of nineteenth-century

00:22:53.125 --> 00:22:56.420
recitative but recitative that
is fully accompanied.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:03.338
&gt;
 

00:23:03.338 --> 00:23:08.538
So here we are at the third
arrow, &lt;&lt;music

00:23:08.538 --> 00:23:10.420
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.039
a lot of tremolo in the strings.
 

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:25.368
&gt;
 

00:23:25.368 --> 00:23:28.067
"What am I going to
do?" "Che faro

00:23:28.067 --> 00:23:28.910
deggio?"
 

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:37.150
&gt;
 

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.992
Now this is a very joyful
setting of the word

00:23:39.992 --> 00:23:41.349
"gioire."
 

00:23:41.349 --> 00:24:01.009
&gt;
 

00:24:01.009 --> 00:24:05.278
And then the third part of our
scena begins.

00:24:05.278 --> 00:24:07.690
Now we have the beginning of a
fast aria.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.190
It's called a cabaletta.
 

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:10.848
It's an operatic device.
 

00:24:10.848 --> 00:24:16.212
It usually appears at the end
of the scene in order to allow

00:24:16.212 --> 00:24:21.484
the protagonist to make a strong
declaration or an emphatic

00:24:21.484 --> 00:24:26.030
statement and then
enthusiastically exit stage left

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.940
or stage right.
 

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.353
It's a kind of convention to
get the protagonist off the

00:24:31.353 --> 00:24:31.848
stage.
 

00:24:31.848 --> 00:24:34.096
Let's listen to a couple of
seconds of this and we're going

00:24:34.096 --> 00:24:36.109
to come back to this particular
cabaletta,

00:24:36.109 --> 00:24:37.328
"Sempre Libre."
 

00:24:37.328 --> 00:24:41.883
It's a famous one--virtually
every major soprano has sung

00:24:41.883 --> 00:24:46.029
it--in which Violetta vows to
remain always free.

00:24:46.029 --> 00:25:16.140
&gt;
 

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:16.561
All right.
 

00:25:16.561 --> 00:25:17.829
We're going to stop it there.
 

00:25:17.829 --> 00:25:19.558
We will come back to that.
 

00:25:19.558 --> 00:25:23.170
But of course,
Violetta doesn't remain free.

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.818
She succumbs to the advances of
Alfredo.

00:25:25.818 --> 00:25:29.675
The two of them live blissfully
together for a while,

00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:31.528
then quarrel,
separate.

00:25:31.528 --> 00:25:35.348
Ultimately, they are reunited
after a period of time,

00:25:35.348 --> 00:25:39.430
but she has developed
consumption, tuberculosis,

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:42.160
akin to the AIDS of the
nineteenth century,

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:45.680
and she dies at the end of the
opera.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.490
We've talked about this
convention of opera before.

00:25:48.490 --> 00:25:51.019
Remember: "It ain't over
'til the fat lady sings."

00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:54.750
That's probably a silly remark
about opera.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.161
In this case,
it ain't over until the thin

00:25:58.161 --> 00:26:03.069
lady sings because on our video
we have the role of Violetta

00:26:03.069 --> 00:26:07.055
sung by Teresa Stratas,
the very thin Teresa

00:26:07.055 --> 00:26:11.028
Stratas--and she is a very fine
actress indeed.

00:26:11.028 --> 00:26:15.440
That's why she was chosen for
this video production.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.912
So that, in brief,
is the story of La

00:26:17.912 --> 00:26:21.587
Traviata and you've got a
video of it that I ask you to

00:26:21.587 --> 00:26:23.108
watch scenes out of.
 

00:26:23.108 --> 00:26:26.933
It's directed by Franco
Zefirelli and it was a

00:26:26.933 --> 00:26:32.203
production that he put together
in the mid 1980s and it's still

00:26:32.203 --> 00:26:33.990
used at the Met .
 

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.298
Again if you go there Thursday
night,

00:26:36.298 --> 00:26:39.821
if you can pony up the
expensive--the big bucks for the

00:26:39.821 --> 00:26:43.361
tickets--
boy, are they expensive--you

00:26:43.361 --> 00:26:46.990
can see this Zefirelli
production--

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:50.068
with different singers of
course, that are on--

00:26:50.068 --> 00:26:52.769
than those on the video,
but it's still being produced--

00:26:52.769 --> 00:26:55.009
all the sets and the costumes
and all,

00:26:55.009 --> 00:26:59.019
exactly as you will see it
there in your video.

00:26:59.019 --> 00:26:59.440
Okay.
 

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.660
So now what I want to do with
the rest of the session today,

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.643
having established a little bit
about Verdi and a little bit

00:27:07.643 --> 00:27:11.027
about La Traviata,
is talk about singers'

00:27:11.027 --> 00:27:15.588
voices--what to listen for with
regard to singers.

00:27:15.588 --> 00:27:20.334
When we went to the Saybrook
Orchestra concert and we went to

00:27:20.334 --> 00:27:24.526
the Jonathan Edwards makeup
concert we were engaging a

00:27:24.526 --> 00:27:29.349
critical ear with regard to
hearing instrumental sounds,

00:27:29.349 --> 00:27:30.400
orchestral sounds.
 

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.868
Well, now we want to do the
same thing &lt;&lt;music

00:27:31.868 --> 00:27:32.359
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:35.210
with regard to vocal sound.
 

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.608
So what is it that makes a good
operatic singer?

00:27:37.608 --> 00:27:41.390
Anybody in here take--ever take
some voice lessons?

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.089
I bet you have.
 

00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:44.390
Don't be bashful now.
 

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.430
Kristin?
 

00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:47.450
Okay.
 

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.309
Did you ever try singing any
opera?

00:27:49.309 --> 00:27:51.150
Okay. Oh, good for you.
 

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.358
Well, tell us about it.
 

00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:54.740
I don't mean to put you on the
spot here.

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:59.073
Do you remember--what was--any
particular opera that you

00:27:59.073 --> 00:27:59.940
remember?
 

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.308
Student: Gianni
Schicchi.

00:28:02.308 --> 00:28:02.940
Prof: Gianni
Schicchi.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.078
Oh, how interesting.
 

00:28:04.078 --> 00:28:08.526
That has that beautiful "O
Mio Babbino Caro"

00:28:08.526 --> 00:28:13.476
that we used as an example of
melody a little bit earlier in

00:28:13.476 --> 00:28:16.170
our course so--
by Puccini, of course.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.318
So let's talk about this for a
minute.

00:28:18.318 --> 00:28:20.759
What constitutes a good
operatic voice?--

00:28:20.759 --> 00:28:24.395
which may be a little bit
different than what constitutes

00:28:24.395 --> 00:28:28.356
a good church voice or a good
synagogue voice or a good mosque

00:28:28.356 --> 00:28:31.869
voice on top of a minaret,
whatever it might happen to be.

00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:34.269
We're talking opera here.
 

00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:36.269
What do you need to have to
have a good operatic voice?

00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:37.940
What would you guess?
 

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.459
Well, nice tone,
a nice tone,

00:28:41.459 --> 00:28:46.990
and a tone that's even from top
to bottom.

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.698
Oftentimes you run in to
singers that have what's called

00:28:49.698 --> 00:28:50.930
a break in their voice.
 

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.666
It might have one tone quality
in the lower register and then

00:28:53.666 --> 00:28:56.313
you can hear it shift in to a
different tone quality in the

00:28:56.313 --> 00:28:57.180
upper register.
 

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:59.244
So you--we don't want that.
 

00:28:59.244 --> 00:29:03.529
We want a kind of smooth
quality from beginning to end.

00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:09.250
Richness of tone color.
 

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:10.599
Other things.
 

00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:12.170
Roger, you had your hand up.
 

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:18.259
Anything you want to add to
that?

00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:18.960
Student: The need to
project--

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.820
Prof: Okay.
 

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:20.730
Project the voice.
 

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:21.598
That's very important.
 

00:29:21.598 --> 00:29:23.470
You've got to have a powerful
voice.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:25.604
You have to have a powerful
voice because if you're singing

00:29:25.604 --> 00:29:27.612
at the Met--
this came up in my section the

00:29:27.612 --> 00:29:29.151
other day--
are you allowed to have

00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:29.930
microphones there?
 

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.308
No, not at the Metropolitan
Opera.

00:29:33.308 --> 00:29:35.834
You have to have a natural
voice that's going to fill that

00:29:35.834 --> 00:29:38.048
auditorium of twenty-five,
twenty-six, twenty-seven

00:29:38.048 --> 00:29:38.890
hundred people.
 

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.432
If you go to a Broadway show,
are the singers amplified by

00:29:42.432 --> 00:29:45.789
microphones there--"Phantom
of the Opera"?

00:29:45.789 --> 00:29:48.920
Yes, they certainly are.
 

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.692
And we talked about that,
how that sound is picked up and

00:29:51.692 --> 00:29:54.664
immediately sent to a mixing
board in the back and there's an

00:29:54.664 --> 00:29:57.338
electronic engineer there
manipulating that sound.

00:29:57.338 --> 00:30:01.460
But for opera singers--you
don't get to do that.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.779
You have to have a powerful
voice that's going to fill the

00:30:03.779 --> 00:30:05.490
hall and they want you to fill
the hall.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.910
They want to fill the hall
'cause they got to sell tickets.

00:30:07.910 --> 00:30:09.338
So they want big halls.
 

00:30:09.338 --> 00:30:10.798
So you have to have a powerful
voice.

00:30:10.798 --> 00:30:12.400
What about the quality of the
voice?

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.536
Well, the bigger the hall
oftentimes you have to generate

00:30:16.536 --> 00:30:17.275
a vibrato.
 

00:30:17.275 --> 00:30:17.940
Right?
 

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:21.150
And we've talked about that
with string players.

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:26.730
But what's the liability of a
vibrato?

00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:29.557
Well, sometimes it can get so
big that it becomes

00:30:29.557 --> 00:30:30.500
uncomfortable.
 

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.519
What is the pitch, please?
 

00:30:32.519 --> 00:30:35.058
So we have to have a
well-focused voice.

00:30:35.058 --> 00:30:38.358
You have to have a powerful
voice, a well-focused voice,

00:30:38.358 --> 00:30:39.078
and so on.
 

00:30:39.078 --> 00:30:42.750
So let's listen to a couple of
famous singers here in the

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.980
course of the twentieth century.
 

00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.005
I am struck by this 'cause a
lot of my acquaintances like

00:30:49.005 --> 00:30:49.940
this music.
 

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.718
I was interested this morning
that our cameraman,

00:30:52.718 --> 00:30:56.133
Jude, said that each morning
his mother listens to Pavarotti

00:30:56.133 --> 00:30:57.059
and Bocelli.
 

00:30:57.059 --> 00:30:59.828
So here is Andrea Bocelli.
 

00:30:59.828 --> 00:31:03.019
And let's listen to a little
bit of his singing.

00:31:03.019 --> 00:31:06.150
How many of you know who this
fellow Bocelli is?

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:07.480
Most of you. Okay.
 

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.920
He's frequently on television.
 

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.752
So listen--a little bit of
Andrea Bocelli and we'll

00:31:11.752 --> 00:31:13.849
focus--try to comment on his
voice.

00:31:13.849 --> 00:32:03.588
&gt;
 

00:32:03.588 --> 00:32:03.769
Okay.
 

00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:05.569
I'd better stop it there before
I get in trouble.

00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:08.230
What do you think of that voice?
 

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:09.869
What do you think of that sound?
 

00:32:09.869 --> 00:32:11.230
Would you buy that?
 

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.650
Is that opera?
 

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:18.608
Well, it's a little--it is kind
of an operatic voice.

00:32:18.608 --> 00:32:21.578
Actually, he studied with
Pavarotti.

00:32:21.578 --> 00:32:23.028
Is it as good as Pavarotti's
voice?

00:32:23.028 --> 00:32:25.660
Well, I--we don't have all
morning to focus on this.

00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.380
No, it's not as good as
Pavarotti's voice.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.609
He goes in the upper register
and he can't hold the notes for

00:32:29.609 --> 00:32:30.019
as long .
 

00:32:30.019 --> 00:32:30.950
It's more pinched.
 

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:32.618
You feel that he's
uncomfortable there.

00:32:32.618 --> 00:32:34.920
In terms of the style of this
music,

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:37.990
is--why is this not--and this
is something--

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.490
what makes this not a real
opera aria here,

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.900
different than an opera aria
right at the beginning?

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:46.930
 
 

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:48.740
It's much more rhythmic. Right?
 

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.669
It's got a back beat to it and
has a strong bass component and

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:53.108
a strong rhythmic component.
 

00:32:53.108 --> 00:32:55.173
It's what I call
"pop-op"

00:32:55.173 --> 00:32:57.420
or "op-pop,"
either way,

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:59.747
"popular opera,"
"opular popera,"

00:32:59.747 --> 00:33:00.240
whatever.
 

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.055
There's a kind of blend between
the two so it's somewhere

00:33:04.055 --> 00:33:06.098
between opera and pop music.
 

00:33:06.098 --> 00:33:09.362
Let's go on now to talk about
the two tenors that have

00:33:09.362 --> 00:33:12.993
dominated the twentieth century
and one of them continues to

00:33:12.993 --> 00:33:15.578
dominate in the twenty-first
century,

00:33:15.578 --> 00:33:18.599
Luciano Pavarotti and Placido
Domingo.

00:33:18.599 --> 00:33:20.298
Okay.
 

00:33:20.298 --> 00:33:23.770
Let's start with
Domingo--really developed as a

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.242
baritone voice,
then a second tenor,

00:33:26.242 --> 00:33:29.358
and then pushed himself up in
to the higher range to sing

00:33:29.358 --> 00:33:32.509
first tenor,
but not initially trained as a

00:33:32.509 --> 00:33:33.490
first tenor.
 

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:37.390
A highly intelligent man,
a great actor,

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.789
a conductor.
 

00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:41.048
It's fascinating.
 

00:33:41.048 --> 00:33:44.596
Sometimes he will sing a
matinee and then in the evening

00:33:44.596 --> 00:33:47.500
will go in to the pit to conduct
an opera,

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.336
so a really impressive
musician, but maybe not the

00:33:51.336 --> 00:33:52.980
voice of Pavarotti.
 

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.573
Let's listen to the two of them
sing the same passage,

00:33:56.573 --> 00:34:00.098
and we have this at the bottom
of your sheet here.

00:34:00.098 --> 00:34:04.137
It's a cabaletta in
which the hero,

00:34:04.137 --> 00:34:10.246
Alfredo, vows to wash away the
sin that has been visited on his

00:34:10.246 --> 00:34:11.329
family.
 

00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:13.518
He's going to wash away this
disgrace.

00:34:13.518 --> 00:34:17.126
So he's going to say,
"I'm going to wash this

00:34:17.126 --> 00:34:20.880
away" and then he's going
to exit the stage.

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.050
So let's listen to Domingo sing
this passage.

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:26.728
You have the text,
again, at the bottom of your

00:34:26.728 --> 00:34:27.019
sheet.
 

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:49.219
&gt;
 

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.880
Okay. No comment.
 

00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:55.393
Let's go on now to listen to
Luciano Pavarotti sing the same

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:55.989
passage.
 

00:34:55.989 --> 00:35:41.309
&gt;
 

00:35:41.309 --> 00:35:46.364
So what's the difference,
maybe two things there that are

00:35:46.364 --> 00:35:48.349
immediately evident?
 

00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:49.389
Roger.
 

00:35:49.389 --> 00:35:50.510
Student: He has a
stronger voice--

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.500
Prof: He has a stronger,
more powerful voice.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.630
I had to ask them to turn down
the volume.

00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:59.030
It's huge and it's rich too.
 

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.840
Anything else there?
 

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.849
We were talking about--Emily,
is it?

00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:05.630
Uh huh.
 

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.599
Student: Pavarotti has
stamina.

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:08.420
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.206
You heard at the end there--I
was starting to look at my watch

00:36:11.206 --> 00:36:13.579
just as--Domingo held that note
for four seconds.

00:36:13.579 --> 00:36:15.550
It's like a diving contest or
something.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:18.119
We're going to hold up a ten or
a seven after this jump here.

00:36:18.119 --> 00:36:20.909
But Domingo held this for four
seconds.

00:36:20.909 --> 00:36:25.469
Pavarotti held it for eleven
seconds--just a hugely high

00:36:25.469 --> 00:36:26.050
note.
 

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:27.880
I think it's a high C.
 

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.690
It's way up here.
 

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:30.800
&gt;
 

00:36:30.800 --> 00:36:31.335
I don't know.
 

00:36:31.335 --> 00:36:33.806
Maybe somebody with absolute
pitch can tell us what that was,

00:36:33.806 --> 00:36:35.822
a hugely high note,
and he just sat on this thing,

00:36:35.822 --> 00:36:37.099
powerful, beautiful tone.
 

00:36:37.099 --> 00:36:39.409
It really is--was--amazing.
 

00:36:39.409 --> 00:36:43.768
Now I think through the marvels
of modern technology here--

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:47.829
and we may crash and burn--we
will find out--

00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:52.407
take a look here at Pavarotti
singing what might have been his

00:36:52.407 --> 00:36:55.389
signature aria,
"Nessun Dorma,"

00:36:55.389 --> 00:36:59.304
out of Turandot and you
have Turandot discussed

00:36:59.304 --> 00:37:02.239
in the exoticism chapter of your
textbook.

00:37:02.239 --> 00:37:04.762
And the set-up here,
as Lynda cues this

00:37:04.762 --> 00:37:07.880
particular--is that
he--"Nessun Dorma"

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.739
means no one will sleep.
 

00:37:09.739 --> 00:37:15.168
He's going to go out and find
the answer to the riddle that

00:37:15.168 --> 00:37:21.065
will allow him to be successful
in his conquest of this ice-cold

00:37:21.065 --> 00:37:26.400
princess that he wants to make
amorous advances upon.

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:32.101
So here's Luciano Pavarotti
sing--This is the end of

00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:38.250
"Nessun Dorma"
and here's Pavarotti with Zubin

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.610
Mehta conducting the New York
Phil.

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:46.630
 
 

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:52.570
And thanks to Lynda for helping
me out and getting all of these

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:57.170
things up and bookmarks and
queued and things.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:58.199
&gt;
 

00:38:58.199 --> 00:38:58.438
Okay.
 

00:38:58.438 --> 00:39:01.119
So that's the great Luciano
Pavarotti and he was great.

00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:03.219
In terms of male voices,
I've never heard--

00:39:03.219 --> 00:39:04.719
and I've listened to a bit of
this,

00:39:04.719 --> 00:39:07.099
going backtracking into the
1920s, and I've never heard

00:39:07.099 --> 00:39:09.480
anything like this in the entire
twentieth century--

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.880
but a word of caution.
 

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:15.568
You can go on YouTube here and
you'll see Pavarotti's picture

00:39:15.568 --> 00:39:19.257
coming up with the same aria and
maybe four or five different

00:39:19.257 --> 00:39:20.550
recordings of it.
 

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:24.422
When was Pavarotti really good
and when did he stop being

00:39:24.422 --> 00:39:25.389
really good?
 

00:39:25.389 --> 00:39:28.380
Don't buy anything of Pavarotti
after 1980..

00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:30.349
From 'seventy eight,
'seventy-nine,

00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:33.538
'eighty--that's the heyday of
Pavarotti's recordings and

00:39:33.538 --> 00:39:34.929
they're spectacular.
 

00:39:34.929 --> 00:39:36.440
Nobody could touch this guy.
 

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.565
But thereafter they really do
begin to decline and you could

00:39:39.565 --> 00:39:42.670
do comparative--
comparisons of these various

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:46.050
recordings over time to watch
the decline,

00:39:46.050 --> 00:39:48.467
and it's sort of sad,
but it's the natural process of

00:39:48.467 --> 00:39:50.840
the aging of the voice and the
aging of the body.

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.840
So now we're going to talk
about the ladies.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.871
We have a number of different
voice terms here,

00:39:56.871 --> 00:40:00.989
vocal terms applying to
particular registers.

00:40:00.989 --> 00:40:05.211
The lowest part of the female
operatic register is called the

00:40:05.211 --> 00:40:08.518
contralto and there are some
floating around.

00:40:08.518 --> 00:40:10.639
There used to be Maria--Maureen
Forrester.

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:13.481
Across the street at our School
of Music, Lili Chookasian

00:40:13.481 --> 00:40:15.650
used to sing at the
Metropolitan Opera.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:18.550
She teaches--is still teaching
at the School of Music.

00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:21.768
I went to school with a woman
named Joyce Castle,

00:40:21.768 --> 00:40:24.382
a contralto,
frequently singing with the

00:40:24.382 --> 00:40:24.920
Met.
 

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:28.213
So that's the kind of low part,
the alto, if you will,

00:40:28.213 --> 00:40:30.139
of the female voice in opera.
 

00:40:30.139 --> 00:40:33.041
Then we have the mezzo-soprano,
kind of half-soprano,

00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:34.827
mezzo,
mezzo forte:

00:40:34.827 --> 00:40:35.610
half loud.
 

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.860
That's between an alto and a
soprano.

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:41.449
Frequently, we've had here at
Yale Frederica von Stade.

00:40:41.449 --> 00:40:43.739
She's a good example of a
mezzo-soprano,

00:40:43.739 --> 00:40:45.969
sneaking up in to the soprano
range.

00:40:45.969 --> 00:40:49.760
Then we have a soprano voice
called the lyric soprano so

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.139
we're up in the high part of the
female range,

00:40:53.139 --> 00:40:56.271
the lyric soprano,
lovely sound,

00:40:56.271 --> 00:40:57.989
a smooth sound.
 

00:40:57.989 --> 00:41:02.561
We also have a soprano called a
dramatic soprano and these are

00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:07.059
voices like Kirsten Flagstad,
Birgit Nilsson and more

00:41:07.059 --> 00:41:12.340
recently Jane Eaglen,
Deborah Voigt.

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.907
These are the women that sing
Wagner and sing Strauss where

00:41:16.907 --> 00:41:21.161
you really need superhuman,
large voices with plenty of

00:41:21.161 --> 00:41:23.920
powerful, well-focused vibrato.
 

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.900
And then finally we have a
voice range called the

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.969
coloratura,
the very top part of the

00:41:28.969 --> 00:41:32.184
soprano range--
very high, tends to be light,

00:41:32.184 --> 00:41:34.534
tends--
if it's good--tends to be well

00:41:34.534 --> 00:41:35.039
focused.
 

00:41:35.039 --> 00:41:37.039
What does a coloratura sound
like?

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:41.880
We don't have a visual here but
we do have the leading,

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.380
I think, coloratura today,
Natalie Dessay,

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:48.599
singing just a bit of something
called the coloratura soprano

00:41:48.599 --> 00:41:52.820
just to give you a sense of what
a coloratura sounds like.

00:41:52.820 --> 00:42:47.409
&gt;
 

00:42:47.409 --> 00:42:49.780
You get the idea,
high and light.

00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:51.760
That's what the coloratura is
all about.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:56.768
Now we're going to focus on
four sopranos singing the same

00:42:56.768 --> 00:42:59.670
aria by way of comparison here.
 

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:04.389
And the aria in question is the
part of that scena that

00:43:04.389 --> 00:43:09.260
we were dealing with before,
"Ah, forse lui, Folia,

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:11.360
Folia" and ultimately
"Sempre Libre."

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:15.289
The first soprano we're going
to start with is Nellie Melba.

00:43:15.289 --> 00:43:19.931
She was an Australian soprano
and was the leading prima donna

00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:23.260
around the turn of the twentieth
century.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:31.773
So this recording--This
particular recording was made

00:43:31.773 --> 00:43:42.579
here on our own historical sound
collection off of an old vinyl.

00:43:42.579 --> 00:43:44.920
It goes back to ninteen oh-five.
 

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.670
So here's Nellie Melba singing.
 

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:47.989
It's a very interesting voice.
 

00:43:47.989 --> 00:43:49.610
Tell me what you think about it.
 

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.800
Put two adjectives with this
voice.

00:43:51.800 --> 00:44:28.449
&gt;
 

00:44:28.449 --> 00:44:30.610
Okay. Let's stop it right there.
 

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.369
What did you think?
 

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:35.914
Santana and Lynda,
you're both professional

00:44:35.914 --> 00:44:36.760
singers.
 

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.800
What did you think of Nellie
Melba here?

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.340
Your head is elsewhere but any
thoughts?

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.469
Student: I love it.
 

00:44:42.469 --> 00:44:45.023
But it sounds like you're
allowed to have a much smaller

00:44:45.023 --> 00:44:47.010
of a voice--
Prof: Okay. Yes.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:48.735
"I love it but it sounds
like you're allowed to have a

00:44:48.735 --> 00:44:49.539
much smaller voice."
 

00:44:49.539 --> 00:44:52.541
The Wagnerian voice hadn't
carried the whole world at this

00:44:52.541 --> 00:44:55.226
point and we think that this is
much more typical of

00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:57.650
nineteenth-century singing:
well focused,

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:01.228
right on pitch but lighter,
perhaps something closer to the

00:45:01.228 --> 00:45:02.030
coloratura.
 

00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:05.918
Now we're going to move on for
reasons of time to another video

00:45:05.918 --> 00:45:09.306
and we're going to hear the
dominant prima donna of the

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:12.570
mid-twentieth century and that
was Maria Callas.

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:14.452
Anybody ever heard of Maria
Callas?

00:45:14.452 --> 00:45:14.840
Okay.
 

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:19.610
&gt;
 

00:45:19.610 --> 00:45:25.748
She was something of a fashion
statement, a femme fatale

00:45:25.748 --> 00:45:31.789
and soprano that dominated the
operatic stage in the 1950s.

00:45:31.789 --> 00:45:33.755
Let's listen to a bit of her
singing.

00:45:33.755 --> 00:45:35.230
Let's see if you like it.
 

00:45:35.230 --> 00:46:11.460
&gt;
 

00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:13.429
Let's stop it there.
 

00:46:13.429 --> 00:46:14.500
Do you like that sound?
 

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.489
Yes or no. How many like it?
 

00:46:16.489 --> 00:46:17.780
How many don't like it?
 

00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:20.025
It reminds me of the fact that
one town that in California

00:46:20.025 --> 00:46:22.389
recently passed or a couple
years ago passed an ordinance.

00:46:22.389 --> 00:46:25.485
To get vagrants out of this
particular shopping center,

00:46:25.485 --> 00:46:28.639
they would pipe nothing but
Maria Callas over the public

00:46:28.639 --> 00:46:29.730
address system.
 

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:32.909
It's a very kind of sharp,
penetrating voice and the older

00:46:32.909 --> 00:46:35.030
she got the wider that vibrato
got,

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:37.500
so some people don't find that
particular--

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.440
that sound particularly
attractive.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.940
Let's go on to--not in
chronologic order 'cause I'm

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.599
going to finish with somebody
else--

00:46:45.599 --> 00:46:49.103
but the reigning diva of today,
RenÃ©e Fleming from

00:46:49.103 --> 00:46:50.480
Rochester, New York.
 

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.960
Her mother is a public school
teacher,

00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:53.860
was a public school voice
teacher in Rochester,

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:56.449
so she's just a hometown girl
from Rochester here,

00:46:56.449 --> 00:46:59.909
but now she is the glamour
girl, the poster girl,

00:46:59.909 --> 00:47:03.030
for all of the--all sopranos in
opera.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.838
And I think we have a video of
the famous RenÃ©e

00:47:06.838 --> 00:47:09.490
Fleming--
always sells out the

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:14.585
Met--singing this material,
and as we listen what interests

00:47:14.585 --> 00:47:18.139
me here is her capacity to
control the voice.

00:47:18.139 --> 00:47:18.403
Wow.
 

00:47:18.403 --> 00:47:22.371
She sort of can sit that tone
out there and just spin it this

00:47:22.371 --> 00:47:24.817
way or spin it that way,
slow it down,

00:47:24.817 --> 00:47:26.469
make it roll faster.
 

00:47:26.469 --> 00:47:28.780
It really--it may not be the
biggest.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.760
It may not be the most--always
the richest--but boy,

00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:37.367
it is sure the most controlled
of these sopranos that I have

00:47:37.367 --> 00:47:38.070
seen.
 

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:44.960
 
 

00:47:44.960 --> 00:48:33.489
&gt;
 

00:48:33.489 --> 00:48:37.329
Okay. So very impressive.
 

00:48:37.329 --> 00:48:39.621
And then finally we're going to
hear from--oh,

00:48:39.621 --> 00:48:40.079
question.
 

00:48:40.079 --> 00:48:40.590
Daniel.
 

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:43.909
Student:
&gt;

00:48:43.909 --> 00:48:45.559
Prof: I don't know how
they do it.

00:48:45.559 --> 00:48:48.090
I've never--I have enough
trouble standing up and singing,

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:51.190
but I guess you wonder about
that, how they can do that,

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.690
how they can keep that pressure
and tone and all,

00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:56.289
reclined like that but they
always do it.

00:48:56.289 --> 00:48:58.280
It's not unusual to see that.
 

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:01.755
And we're going to end here
with a couple of things,

00:49:01.755 --> 00:49:04.822
Joan Sutherland,
probably the greatest soprano

00:49:04.822 --> 00:49:06.800
of the twentieth century.
 

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.956
She really also reached her
peak about 1980 and she

00:49:09.956 --> 00:49:13.619
frequently sang with Pavarotti
and on the CDs for your--

00:49:13.619 --> 00:49:16.282
our course here,
I have chosen Pavarotti and

00:49:16.282 --> 00:49:19.565
Sutherland singing La
Traviata because I get to

00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:23.101
choose these particular CDs,
the recordings that go on our

00:49:23.101 --> 00:49:23.360
CDs.
 

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:26.889
So here you're going to see a
bit of Joan Sutherland.

00:49:26.889 --> 00:49:29.291
She wasn't particularly
distinguished as an actress but

00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:31.382
boy, what a voice,
and what you're going to hear

00:49:31.382 --> 00:49:33.250
here--and I'll play this very
quickly.

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:45.679
We've got a line that's going
&gt;.

00:49:45.679 --> 00:49:48.739
She's going to add a soprano
line here that goes--

00:49:48.739 --> 00:49:51.469
jumps up an octave higher than
Verdi actually wrote it,

00:49:51.469 --> 00:49:57.139
and if you listen to Fleming in
this aria Fleming will end here;

00:49:57.139 --> 00:49:59.119
&gt;
 

00:49:59.119 --> 00:50:02.059
Sutherland will end
&gt;

00:50:02.059 --> 00:50:03.059
a full octave higher.
 

00:50:03.059 --> 00:50:06.550
So let's listen to this woman
with a beautiful coloratura,

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:09.061
very well focused,
powerful in all ranges,

00:50:09.061 --> 00:50:10.960
sort of the complete voice.
 

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:17.460
 
 

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:21.309
And then on the way out while
we're loading this,

00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:23.284
we have the
"Habanera"

00:50:23.284 --> 00:50:26.981
of Bizet on our quiz and we're
going to have an alternative

00:50:26.981 --> 00:50:30.039
performance of Bizet's
"Habanera."

00:50:30.039 --> 00:51:04.300
 
 

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:05.949
Listen to your CDs.
 

00:51:05.949 --> 00:51:08.440
Let's go to our last clip.
 

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:13.911
You remember the
"Habanera"

00:51:13.911 --> 00:51:19.690
with the &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.797
and so on, the descending
chromatic scale,

00:51:21.797 --> 00:51:22.929
ostinato underneath.
 

00:51:22.929 --> 00:51:24.940
I found a better version of
this.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.630
I don't know whether this is
the dumbest thing &lt;&lt;music

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:27.059
playing&gt;&gt;
 

00:51:27.059 --> 00:51:29.349
you have ever seen;
it probably is.

00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:30.742
Or it's really funny.
 

00:51:30.742 --> 00:51:31.670
I can't tell.
 

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:40.250
&gt;
 

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:43.054
So I don't know what kind of
soprano voice this is,

00:51:43.054 --> 00:51:44.570
but it sure is different.
 

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:57.809
&gt;
 

00:51:57.809 --> 00:51:59.536
Okay.
 

00:51:59.536 --> 00:52:19.570
So lets see if we--I--I'm still
after--Here's Sutherland.

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:37.000
&gt;
 

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:45.000

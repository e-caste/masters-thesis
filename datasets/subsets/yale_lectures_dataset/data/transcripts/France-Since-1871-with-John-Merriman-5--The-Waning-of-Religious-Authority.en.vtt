00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.248
Professor John Merriman:
Okay, I'm going to talk about

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:03.770
religion today,

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.497
yes, and what I'm going to
first--well, I'll talk just a

00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:15.858
little bit about people who
weren't born into the Catholic

00:00:15.858 --> 00:00:19.080
Church.
The vast majority of the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.741
population of France at the
time, in the course,

00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:27.510
until say 1960,
were born Catholic.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.302
Now, whether they practiced
their religion is something

00:00:30.302 --> 00:00:33.252
we'll come to in a minute.
Of the percentage of the

00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:36.946
population of France who were
Protestants, which I'll talk a

00:00:36.946 --> 00:00:40.390
little bit about in a minute,
is about five percent.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.009
The number of Jews,
I think Chip Sowerwine tells

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:47.860
you in his book,
but I think it's about 300,000.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.729
Now, first let me tell you
where Protestants and Jews were,

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.732
for the most part,
and why, just to give you a

00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:58.181
sense of all this.
The Reformation,

00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:05.362
in the sixteenth century when
it sort of--Calvinism expands

00:01:05.362 --> 00:01:09.555
from Geneva,
where Jean Calvin had

00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:14.894
considerable influence,
it spread really down the

00:01:14.894 --> 00:01:20.132
Rhône River,
and it conquered large parts or

00:01:20.132 --> 00:01:25.000
found adepts in large parts of
this part of France,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.030
including Lyon.
Lyon was conquered back by the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.730
Catholic Church,
as they would consider it the

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.081
Catholic Reformation;
or it used to be called the

00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:34.769
Counter-Reformation,
but you don't call it that any

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:36.597
more.
But yet there were large

00:01:36.597 --> 00:01:40.232
sections of the south of France
that remained Protestant,

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:43.318
and that still are.
Just in case it ever pops up in

00:01:43.318 --> 00:01:45.992
a crossword puzzle,
the department with the largest

00:01:45.992 --> 00:01:49.592
number of Protestants,
something like a third--it's

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:54.280
about what it was in the
nineteenth century--is the Gard,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.515
g-a-r-d, that you would--that's
where Nîmes is the capital

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:02.377
of it;
and the second is the

00:02:02.377 --> 00:02:05.411
Ardèche,
a-r-d-e-c-h-e,

00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:10.058
which is where we hang out.
There also still and were

00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:13.135
Protestants in the river
valleys, coming down to the

00:02:13.135 --> 00:02:16.092
Rhône, particularly in the
Department of the

00:02:16.092 --> 00:02:18.813
Drôme.
You don't have to remember all

00:02:18.813 --> 00:02:21.923
this information.
Lots of Protestants in Lorraine

00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:24.050
and in Alsace,
and, of course,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.423
that had been amputated and
annexed to Germany,

00:02:27.423 --> 00:02:30.650
and Protestants sort of here
and there.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.936
Lots of Protestants,
when the Edict of Nantes,

00:02:33.936 --> 00:02:38.244
that is, that gave toleration
to Protestants and was revoked

00:02:38.244 --> 00:02:42.160
by Louis XIV in 1685,
lots of people tried to get out.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.648
Lots of Huguenots,
as they were called,

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:47.530
went to Amsterdam,
to the Pays-Bas,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.341
to the Netherlands,
and lots tried to go to Quebec

00:02:50.341 --> 00:02:53.899
in Canada because they thought
it'd be easier to practice their

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.266
religion there.
But many of them couldn't

00:02:56.266 --> 00:02:59.280
afford the passage and end up
living here in the Charente,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.948
in the Charente-Maritime,
in this are here,

00:03:01.948 --> 00:03:04.490
the Charente--that's a
beautiful city,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.347
France's most beautiful city,
on the coast,

00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:07.939
outside of Collioure,
La Rochelle,

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:10.370
the capital of the
Charente-Maritime.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.867
And then you have Protestants,
of course, in Paris and in some

00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:18.166
of the large cities.
What happens is after the

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:22.460
annexation of Alsace and much of
Lorraine by the German Empire,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.108
many of the Protestants in
Alsace, and some in Lorraine,

00:03:28.108 --> 00:03:30.416
moved.
Many moved to Belfort,

00:03:30.416 --> 00:03:33.254
which became a territory,
not a department,

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:37.240
because of the heroic defense
of Belfort by a general during

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.002
the Franco-Prussian War.
So, there are your main centers

00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:45.637
of Protestantism.
Now, what about Jews,

00:03:45.637 --> 00:03:49.940
who get rights during the
French Revolution?

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.092
The first synagogue in France,
which is routinely targeted by

00:03:54.092 --> 00:03:57.000
vicious graffiti and this sort
of thing,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.292
is in the Vaucluse,
that is the

00:03:58.292 --> 00:04:00.618
département of
Avignon, in a place called

00:04:00.618 --> 00:04:03.767
Carpentras or Carpentràs,
you can say either word,

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:05.897
tras usually,
Carpentras usually,

00:04:05.897 --> 00:04:08.560
on the other side of the
Rhône.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.913
You have large concentrations
of Jews, Sephardic Jews,

00:04:12.913 --> 00:04:17.350
in Bordeaux and in Paris and in
Alsace and Lorraine,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.051
where there had been really
vigorous and vicious

00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:24.990
anti-Semitic riots after the
Revolution of 1848.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.803
And in Alsace,
interestingly enough,

00:04:26.803 --> 00:04:29.031
the three religions,
that is, the Catholics,

00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:31.984
the Protestants and the Jews,
tried to outdo each other in

00:04:31.984 --> 00:04:34.276
charity.
They set up really remarkable

00:04:34.276 --> 00:04:37.300
kind of voluntary associations
to help out poor people;

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.009
and it points to one sort of
interesting aspect of it.

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:43.690
So, that's just a sort of
overview.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.284
But the vast majority of the
population were born into the

00:04:47.284 --> 00:04:50.455
Catholic Church.
Now, because of the role of the

00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:52.557
church in the
counter-revolution,

00:04:52.557 --> 00:04:57.449
of the great French Revolution,
and because of the close

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:03.100
attachment of the Catholic
Church to the monarchy,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.600
that is, support for the
ill-fated Comte de Chambord,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.515
Henri V and all of that,
you have this tension between

00:05:10.515 --> 00:05:13.949
the Catholic Church,
as a public institution,

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.899
and an increasingly powerful
state.

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:23.718
Now, one differentiation that
you should make is between

00:05:23.718 --> 00:05:28.099
de-Christianization,
which I'm going to talk about,

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:31.558
and anti-clericalism.
Now, Voltaire,

00:05:31.558 --> 00:05:35.273
the great philosophe,
he once said,

00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:39.652
"crush the awful thing."
And he didn't mean religion

00:05:39.652 --> 00:05:44.019
itself, what he meant was the
public institutional role of the

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:48.456
Catholic Church;
and he was--became the ultimate

00:05:48.456 --> 00:05:52.029
sort of symbol of
anti-clericalism.

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:56.252
And anti-clericalism wasn't
necessarily anti-religiosity,

00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:59.420
what it was was against the
public role,

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.990
the institutional role of the
Catholic Church in politics.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.820
Thus, in French cities,
in the 1880s,

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:16.335
1890s, there are literally
battles over urban space where

00:06:16.335 --> 00:06:20.884
laicized,
secularized and anti-clerical

00:06:20.884 --> 00:06:26.782
municipalities want to refuse
the right of the Catholic Church

00:06:26.782 --> 00:06:32.879
to stage processions of relics,
for example, on feast days.

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.337
In Limoges, which became La
Ville Rouge,

00:06:36.337 --> 00:06:39.043
the Red City,
it had once been a very

00:06:39.043 --> 00:06:42.350
religious town but they still
have this,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:45.895
every seven years they still do
these processions where they

00:06:45.895 --> 00:06:48.420
haul saints' relics through the
streets.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.075
And so the municipality said,
no, you can't do that because

00:06:52.075 --> 00:06:55.290
that is violating the neutrality
of public space.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.463
And so thus you have this big
bagarre,

00:06:58.463 --> 00:07:02.720
you've got this big brawl
between a church and laicizing,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.060
secularizing municipalities
influenced by socialism;

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.996
and not necessarily against
religion but against the public

00:07:12.996 --> 00:07:18.282
role of the Catholic Church.
And so that's kind of a

00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:23.901
background for all of that.
Now, it used to be,

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:28.483
maybe 80 years ago--no,
less than that,

00:07:28.483 --> 00:07:35.356
maybe 50 years ago--that one of
the interpretations of the

00:07:35.356 --> 00:07:39.547
French Revolution,
the impact of the French

00:07:39.547 --> 00:07:42.087
Revolution and the Empire,
the First Empire,

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:44.674
that is "N One,"
Napoleon the First who made

00:07:44.674 --> 00:07:47.495
peace with the church,
was that it was the revolution

00:07:47.495 --> 00:07:49.720
that destroyed that old-time
religion.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.916
And in 1815 when Louis XVIII,
before this course cranks up,

00:07:55.916 --> 00:08:02.220
comes back, he espouses the
view that church people had that

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:08.417
the revolution had been created
by people like Rousseau and

00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:11.841
Voltaire,
and that they had been

00:08:11.841 --> 00:08:16.146
responsible for moving France
away from that old-time

00:08:16.146 --> 00:08:19.278
religion.
And as I said the other day,

00:08:19.278 --> 00:08:23.249
after 1815 there is a revival
of intense religiosity,

00:08:23.249 --> 00:08:27.490
in some regions.
You find the same thing in the

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:31.769
1870s, again the Republic of the
Moral Order.

00:08:31.769 --> 00:08:34.820
And so that's what the church
wanted people to believe,

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.250
and many historians believe
that as well.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:40.252
But along came a historian
called Michel Vovelle,

00:08:40.252 --> 00:08:43.066
v-o-v-e-l-l-e,
who used to be the Professor of

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:46.506
the French Revolution at the
Sorbonne and he's kind of a

00:08:46.506 --> 00:08:48.641
friend of mine,
or at least a good

00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:50.240
acquaintance,
a very old dude now.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:55.681
And Vovelle was interested to
see whether that old-time

00:08:55.681 --> 00:09:01.828
religion was already crumbling
or in decline before the French

00:09:01.828 --> 00:09:06.185
Revolution.
And so he started out asking

00:09:06.185 --> 00:09:11.470
just how effective was the
Counter-Reformation or the

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.991
Catholic reformation,
if you will,

00:09:14.991 --> 00:09:19.046
in bringing back,
reviving that baroque piety,

00:09:19.046 --> 00:09:24.425
of a religion of faith,
of a religion in paintings of

00:09:24.425 --> 00:09:29.240
swooning cupids,
of intense religious belief.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:34.291
And what he discovered was that
in the parts of France that he

00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:39.259
looked at, that that old-time
religion was already waning.

00:09:39.259 --> 00:09:44.817
And thus we come to the
concept, which is important for

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:50.889
this course, and just in
general, of de-Christianization.

00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:54.269
And de-Christianization means
two things.

00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:57.044
First--again,
before this course--it meant

00:09:57.044 --> 00:10:00.970
the campaign against the Church
as a public institution,

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:06.125
and really against organized
religion, undertaken by--during

00:10:06.125 --> 00:10:09.970
the Terror, by Robespierre and
the others.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:14.472
It meant melting down church
bells, it meant--meaning that

00:10:14.472 --> 00:10:18.105
only priests who swore
allegiance to the French

00:10:18.105 --> 00:10:20.085
Revolution,
to the nation,

00:10:20.085 --> 00:10:22.529
could say mass,
and pretty soon putting them

00:10:22.529 --> 00:10:24.860
under pressure not to say mass
at all.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.820
But that's not what we're
talking about.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.277
The residuals,
the remnants of that are still

00:10:29.277 --> 00:10:31.679
important in the period we're
discussing.

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:34.252
But what Vovelle,
whose name I should write on

00:10:34.252 --> 00:10:36.939
the board, in a book called
Baroque Piety and

00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:41.527
de-Christianization,
which is looking at part of

00:10:41.527 --> 00:10:47.944
Provence, started with that,
what he meant was that decline

00:10:47.944 --> 00:10:52.541
in religious practice.
Now, it's very hard--imagine

00:10:52.541 --> 00:10:55.876
you're in the story,
and that's what you are in this

00:10:55.876 --> 00:10:58.573
course,
how are you going to prove

00:10:58.573 --> 00:11:03.289
whether religion has that--has
still an important role in the

00:11:03.289 --> 00:11:06.577
individual person,
or in family life,

00:11:06.577 --> 00:11:10.853
or in public life,
if you're looking a long time

00:11:10.853 --> 00:11:13.849
ago?
How are you going to know that

00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:18.490
in a society in which in the
eighteenth century the majority

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.480
of people could not read and
write,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.802
and in which the only things
about religion that you could

00:11:25.802 --> 00:11:30.656
read were reports written by--or
sermons written by--published by

00:11:30.656 --> 00:11:35.226
bishops and archbishops,
or reports sent by those

00:11:35.226 --> 00:11:41.139
delegates of bishops and
archbishops going around France,

00:11:41.139 --> 00:11:46.060
going around their dioceses to
see how many--what the state of

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.650
religion was?
How do you do that,

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.010
how do you know what--whether
people went to church or not?

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:56.937
How do you know that?
And so what he did was the

00:11:56.937 --> 00:12:00.064
following, and this was--talk
about tough work,

00:12:00.064 --> 00:12:02.580
that there are ways of doing
this.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.341
Let me just give you a couple.
For example,

00:12:05.341 --> 00:12:07.540
I don't know how--some of you
raised Catholic.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.309
I was raised Catholic.
I was once thrown out of

00:12:10.309 --> 00:12:13.509
religion class and paddled in a
Jesuit high school in Portland,

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:16.471
Oregon because the guy had
messed up Thomas Aquinas's

00:12:16.471 --> 00:12:19.945
proofs of the existence of God
and I thought I was a smart-ass

00:12:19.945 --> 00:12:22.963
and I could prove that God
couldn't exist by what he'd

00:12:22.963 --> 00:12:25.398
done,
and so they threw me out of

00:12:25.398 --> 00:12:28.396
religion class.
But, so I don't know if that

00:12:28.396 --> 00:12:31.700
would be a statistic in this
kind of evolution,

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:35.203
but basically what--in the
Catholic Church babies have had

00:12:35.203 --> 00:12:38.646
to be--I don't know if it's
still the case--but had to be

00:12:38.646 --> 00:12:41.720
baptized within the first three
days of birth;

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:45.638
thus all these certificates
that have--remember the acte

00:12:45.638 --> 00:12:47.868
de temoignage,
where people say,

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:50.195
"I see this baby,
the baby is alive," and they

00:12:50.195 --> 00:12:53.349
baptize the baby so if the baby
dies--and remember babies died

00:12:53.349 --> 00:12:55.909
all the time,
after childbirth.

00:12:55.909 --> 00:12:58.952
If you made it to one,
year one, you had a good chance

00:12:58.952 --> 00:13:02.510
of living to the ripe old age of
40--that if you didn't baptize

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.702
the baby and the baby died,
then the baby was going to go

00:13:05.702 --> 00:13:08.039
to limbo or something and sort
of float around;

00:13:08.039 --> 00:13:11.820
there were all these popular
beliefs about limbo.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.353
And so what he did is he went
out and he looked at all these

00:13:15.353 --> 00:13:17.509
baptisms, certificates of
baptism,

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:20.964
thousands of them,
to see how long it was

00:13:20.964 --> 00:13:24.850
that--how long did people,
after the birth,

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.572
did they baptize their children.
And now people had already

00:13:27.572 --> 00:13:30.218
started thinking about that.
The first religious

00:13:30.218 --> 00:13:33.767
sociologists were priests,
at the end of the nineteenth

00:13:33.767 --> 00:13:36.658
century, who said,
"people don't go to church

00:13:36.658 --> 00:13:39.602
anymore, why not?"
And so they went out and they

00:13:39.602 --> 00:13:42.517
began to--in fact one of the
people whose work I most admire

00:13:42.517 --> 00:13:44.705
is an old,
very old, he must be 110 or

00:13:44.705 --> 00:13:47.223
literally 90,
a priest in Limoges who used to

00:13:47.223 --> 00:13:50.142
go out and look in the
cemeteries to see what people

00:13:50.142 --> 00:13:53.440
had written on tombs,
and he looked at the names that

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.360
people named babies--more about
that in a minute.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.499
So, what Vovelle found,
and what subsequent historians

00:13:59.499 --> 00:14:02.691
of religion have found,
are that the curve goes

00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:06.263
something like this:
three days to a month to two

00:14:06.263 --> 00:14:09.690
months to six months.
And in the nineteenth century

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.897
increasingly,
in parts of France--that's

00:14:11.897 --> 00:14:14.355
key--never.
And then are other things you

00:14:14.355 --> 00:14:17.272
could do.
When people of means died they

00:14:17.272 --> 00:14:19.398
left wills.
In the 1830s in Paris

00:14:19.398 --> 00:14:22.397
seventy-five percent of the
population left nothing to

00:14:22.397 --> 00:14:25.340
nobody because they had nothing
to leave anybody,

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.010
and they couldn't afford to
have anybody draw up a will,

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:31.019
they couldn't afford a lawyer
or a notary to draw up a will.

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:35.193
And so what Vovelle found was
that where people had in earlier

00:14:35.193 --> 00:14:38.819
times, at the height of the
Counter-Reformation or the

00:14:38.819 --> 00:14:42.326
Catholic Reformation,
in the seventeenth century,

00:14:42.326 --> 00:14:46.120
they had left money to have
masses said for their souls,

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.552
or they had left money to
Catholic institutions caring for

00:14:50.552 --> 00:14:53.740
lepers or caring for other sick
people,

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:58.019
or foundling homes.
And increasingly they stopped

00:14:58.019 --> 00:15:01.842
doing that, in the areas that he
looked at, and they started

00:15:01.842 --> 00:15:04.240
leaving money to lay
associations,

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.470
or to somebody else,
to their uncle or to their

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:13.896
children, and no longer 150
masses said on their anniversary

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:18.078
or their birthday,
for the repose of their mortal

00:15:18.078 --> 00:15:19.720
soul.
And then you can look at

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:23.468
religious vocations.
There are parts of France that

00:15:23.468 --> 00:15:27.950
have always had a lot of
priests, Finestère,

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:31.549
Brittany, for one example.
So, you could look,

00:15:31.549 --> 00:15:34.813
and what he discovered was that
the number of people going into

00:15:34.813 --> 00:15:36.526
the clergy,
men and women,

00:15:36.526 --> 00:15:40.780
declined rapidly in the parts
of Provence that he looked at.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.550
Now, that's a good sign.
What about names?

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.861
There's another one.
This is--talk about boring

00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:48.299
work, but this is what this guy
in Limoges did.

00:15:48.299 --> 00:15:52.851
When people start naming their
babies, when they stop naming

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:56.399
them after saints,
that tells you something.

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:57.953
For example,
in the Limousin,

00:15:57.953 --> 00:16:00.672
this is an example,
but in the Limousin the saints

00:16:00.672 --> 00:16:04.312
that were big time saints there,
one is Léonard,

00:16:04.312 --> 00:16:06.407
like Leonard,
and another was Martial,

00:16:06.407 --> 00:16:08.927
the name Martial.
And so this guy looked and

00:16:08.927 --> 00:16:11.915
people stopped naming their
children Martial and Leonard,

00:16:11.915 --> 00:16:15.023
Léonard.
And that tells you something

00:16:15.023 --> 00:16:17.220
too.
Or a more obvious one would be

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.905
women's names.
You may, but you probably don't

00:16:19.905 --> 00:16:21.820
know people named Mary
Magdalene.

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:24.943
And during the French
Revolution a lot of people took

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:28.427
old Roman names and started
naming their babies things like

00:16:28.427 --> 00:16:31.856
Gracchus and names like that.
But you can look--you don't

00:16:31.856 --> 00:16:34.801
know anybody named Gracchus I
bet--but you can--this was

00:16:34.801 --> 00:16:36.730
another way that you could do
it.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.291
And there's other ways too.
Remember, I said that one of

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:43.692
the published sources you can
actually read are these bishops'

00:16:43.692 --> 00:16:46.480
sermons because they were
published every year,

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.270
and when these bishops'
sermons, and now I'm talking

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:51.240
more about the nineteenth
century,

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.121
when they start talking about
the dark secrets--what are the

00:16:56.121 --> 00:17:00.010
dark secrets at a time of
plunging birthrate?

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:05.192
Birth control, birth control.
And that tells you something

00:17:05.192 --> 00:17:08.671
very indirectly as well.
And what about even going to

00:17:08.671 --> 00:17:10.939
mass?
In the Catholic Church you're

00:17:10.939 --> 00:17:15.065
supposed to go to mass on Sunday
and you're certainly supposed to

00:17:15.065 --> 00:17:18.740
go to mass, and confession,
on Easter, at Easter time.

00:17:18.740 --> 00:17:22.009
And so that's one of the things
they had the priests count up.

00:17:22.009 --> 00:17:27.140
They would count people who
were in the church.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:30.440
And what you had is again an
astonishing decline of the

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.579
number of people going to
church.

00:17:32.579 --> 00:17:34.360
Just an aside,
because I worked with a

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.054
sociologist and the first
thing--well I didn't have a job

00:17:37.054 --> 00:17:39.248
one year,
the first year after I finished

00:17:39.248 --> 00:17:41.172
my degree at Michigan,
Mighty Michigan,

00:17:41.172 --> 00:17:43.500
maize and blue forever--I
taught sociology,

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.910
and so I was used to counting
things.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.217
I worked with a great
sociologist called Charles

00:17:49.217 --> 00:17:50.599
Tilly.
And so one day,

00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:53.635
because I was writing a book
about our village,

00:17:53.635 --> 00:17:56.484
and with my daughter then,
who was about 11,

00:17:56.484 --> 00:17:58.904
we heard the bells ring,
there's--for church,

00:17:58.904 --> 00:18:01.599
and there's only a Mass about
every six weeks,

00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:03.454
more about that later,
and I said, "well,

00:18:03.454 --> 00:18:06.049
let's go up and count the
number of people in church."

00:18:06.049 --> 00:18:10.829
And there's a huge gap between
men and women in the church

00:18:10.829 --> 00:18:13.509
attendance.
It was true in the nineteenth

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:16.591
century and it's true now.
So we go to the back of this

00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:19.394
church and we start counting the
number of people,

00:18:19.394 --> 00:18:22.380
and there were eighteen people.
And my daughter,

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:24.525
then eleven,
all of a sudden said,

00:18:24.525 --> 00:18:27.125
"mais papa,
même les femmes sont

00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:29.920
chauves," even the women are
bald.

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.050
And, of course,
then everybody in the church

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.576
turned around and looked at us
standing in the back,

00:18:34.576 --> 00:18:36.359
and she had a cruel point
there;

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:39.380
she didn't mean to be cruel but
it was that most of the people

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.460
who went to church were very old
ladies.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.917
But the priests,
even now, and this particular

00:18:43.917 --> 00:18:47.194
village does not have a regular
priest and it has not had for

00:18:47.194 --> 00:18:49.626
decades,
they count the number of people

00:18:49.626 --> 00:18:52.951
who are there on Easter.
And what you had is this

00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:56.971
precipitous decline in the
number of people going to

00:18:56.971 --> 00:18:59.990
church.
So that is de-Christianization.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:04.008
Let me give you another
example, from World War I,

00:19:04.008 --> 00:19:06.356
war memorials.
Many of you have had my

00:19:06.356 --> 00:19:09.105
friend--some of you may have had
my friend Jay Winters' course

00:19:09.105 --> 00:19:11.720
and he works--he's done a lot of
work on war memorials.

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.450
And if you go to parts of
France that were very

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:15.029
de-Christianized,
more about this later,

00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:19.167
if you go to the Creuze or up
here to the Nièvre here

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:21.697
or the Allier,
those are sort of classic

00:19:21.697 --> 00:19:24.006
examples of very
de-Christianized parts of

00:19:24.006 --> 00:19:26.418
France,
even the war memorials were in

00:19:26.418 --> 00:19:29.683
some places where you practiced
religion, the war--the

00:19:29.683 --> 00:19:33.380
number--the monument to the dead
will be near the church.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.908
In some of those places the
monument to the dead is not only

00:19:36.908 --> 00:19:39.420
not near the church that no one
goes to,

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.467
but will have a broken cross,
asking that same question that

00:19:43.467 --> 00:19:46.692
Voltaire once asked about the
Lisbon earthquake:

00:19:46.692 --> 00:19:51.213
"if there is a God,
how could he or she have

00:19:51.213 --> 00:19:57.361
allowed this to happen?"
And even those monuments are

00:19:57.361 --> 00:20:03.855
symbols of a decline in what had
been assumed by the church,

00:20:03.855 --> 00:20:09.139
and indeed assumed by the
state, of that old-time

00:20:09.139 --> 00:20:13.339
religion.
But now, is this true

00:20:13.339 --> 00:20:15.979
everywhere?
Well no, not at all,

00:20:15.979 --> 00:20:19.226
and that's one of the points,
and that's one of the reasons

00:20:19.226 --> 00:20:21.690
that I insist--and if you don't
have one,

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.148
please come up and get one
later--those handy little maps

00:20:24.148 --> 00:20:26.519
with the regions and the
départements;

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:29.927
because there are huge
differences, and these

00:20:29.927 --> 00:20:33.800
differences were already
apparent in the eighteenth

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.049
century.
The French Revolution was,

00:20:37.049 --> 00:20:41.420
above all, this civil war,
a war about religion.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:45.797
And if you take a map from 1789
or 1790, '90,

00:20:45.797 --> 00:20:51.069
when the priests had to either
swear to the nation,

00:20:51.069 --> 00:20:54.798
to the French Revolution,
or refuse to swear to the

00:20:54.798 --> 00:20:59.162
Revolution and to the nation,
and you take that map and you

00:20:59.162 --> 00:21:02.630
put it along a map of the
elections of May 1849,

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.657
and you put that on top of a
map of the election of

00:21:05.657 --> 00:21:09.289
François Mitterrand as
President of France of 1981,

00:21:09.289 --> 00:21:13.539
they're almost the same,
with very few changes.

00:21:13.539 --> 00:21:17.222
And one of the predictors--here
I sound like a sociologist,

00:21:17.222 --> 00:21:20.905
which I am not--but one of the
predictors of all of that is

00:21:20.905 --> 00:21:24.079
de-Christianization,
because the regions of

00:21:24.079 --> 00:21:28.579
political conservatism are the
regions in which that old-time

00:21:28.579 --> 00:21:31.730
religion was--which those
regions were less

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:34.730
de-Christianized than other
places.

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.736
So, where were the
de-Christianized regions,

00:21:37.736 --> 00:21:41.652
where were the areas of still
intense religious practice,

00:21:41.652 --> 00:21:45.450
just for the hell of it?
Auvergne, again Auvergne,

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:49.720
that's a region you should at
least know something about.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.006
If you like gastronomy you'll
think of aligot,

00:21:52.006 --> 00:21:54.851
fabulous garlic with potatoes,
or you'll think of stuffed

00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:57.289
cabbage, you'll think of all
sorts of stuff.

00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:59.710
But that's not what we're
talking about.

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:04.740
In Auvergne you still have
intense religiosity.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.151
We have friends who once owned
a café

00:22:07.151 --> 00:22:09.170
across from the National
Archives,

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.636
where I spend quite a lot of
time, in both institutions,

00:22:12.636 --> 00:22:15.220
and they--the wife was from the
Vernon,

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.179
which is way down here,
Millau and all that,

00:22:18.179 --> 00:22:21.769
and the husband is from Cantal,
which is up here,

00:22:21.769 --> 00:22:25.301
Aurillac, there.
And they had thirteen and

00:22:25.301 --> 00:22:28.928
twelve brothers and sisters,
respectively,

00:22:28.928 --> 00:22:33.440
born in abject misery in the
1930s, just misery.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.038
Classic, some of the babies
died, but that's a lot of

00:22:37.038 --> 00:22:39.173
children.
Now, if you compare that,

00:22:39.173 --> 00:22:42.470
if you go about--if you want to
drive about not even a day,

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:46.127
you get down here near Agen,
the Prune Capital of France,

00:22:46.127 --> 00:22:48.869
and one of the rugby capitals
of France,

00:22:48.869 --> 00:22:50.262
it was said,
and was true,

00:22:50.262 --> 00:22:53.269
that if, and I mentioned this
the first day I think,

00:22:53.269 --> 00:22:56.701
that if you had more--if you
had a second child in some

00:22:56.701 --> 00:22:59.370
villages you received a
condolence card,

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.019
a condolence card.
Now, how different that is,

00:23:03.019 --> 00:23:05.299
and those places aren't very
far away.

00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:08.829
Well, the Lot-et-Garonne,
down here, is extremely

00:23:08.829 --> 00:23:11.549
de-Christianized,
whereas Auvergne,

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:16.436
one of the things the Catholic
Church said was no dark secrets

00:23:16.436 --> 00:23:20.883
baby, and have lots of children,
and send the younger ones into

00:23:20.883 --> 00:23:24.099
the clergy, as sisters and nuns
and that sort of stuff.

00:23:24.099 --> 00:23:27.994
Other areas of religious
practice: in Alsace Catholics,

00:23:27.994 --> 00:23:31.527
Protestants and Jews all
practiced their religion,

00:23:31.527 --> 00:23:34.159
very faithfully.
In the north of France,

00:23:34.159 --> 00:23:36.641
particularly in Flemish parts
of the nord,

00:23:36.641 --> 00:23:39.019
that old-time religion was
still practiced.

00:23:39.019 --> 00:23:41.477
In much of Normandy,
the same thing,

00:23:41.477 --> 00:23:45.269
though not in big cities,
less in Rouen for example;

00:23:45.269 --> 00:23:49.117
and in Brittany,
above all, religion was

00:23:49.117 --> 00:23:52.569
practiced, as it always had
been.

00:23:52.569 --> 00:23:56.002
And there were huge numbers of
people going on what in they

00:23:56.002 --> 00:23:59.554
call in Brittany the pardons,
which are religious ceremonies,

00:23:59.554 --> 00:24:02.511
full of festivity as well.
Now what are the big

00:24:02.511 --> 00:24:06.240
de-Christianized areas?
Almost any large city.

00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.308
Even in the case of Brittany,
Brest, because it had so many

00:24:09.308 --> 00:24:11.529
sailors who weren't from
Brittany there;

00:24:11.529 --> 00:24:13.450
though a lot of Bretons were
sailors also.

00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.329
For example,
in L'Havre there are lots of

00:24:15.329 --> 00:24:17.729
Bretons who live in L'Havre;
but anyway that makes things

00:24:17.729 --> 00:24:20.404
more complicated than they are.
Most big cities,

00:24:20.404 --> 00:24:26.099
some exceptions--Lyon is still
fairly practicing Catholic;

00:24:26.099 --> 00:24:29.539
Paris, totally lost to the
church.

00:24:29.539 --> 00:24:31.803
One of the things,
if you go to the suburbs of

00:24:31.803 --> 00:24:34.720
Paris, even the inner suburbs
that were annexed in 1860,

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.181
you'll see all of these
extremely modest and sometimes

00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:42.101
just impossibly ugly churches
that were built in the 1870s to

00:24:42.101 --> 00:24:45.954
try to re-conquer the working
class population that had been

00:24:45.954 --> 00:24:50.069
lost in the working class
suburbs to the Catholic Church.

00:24:50.069 --> 00:24:51.828
Sacré
Coeur, which I've already

00:24:51.828 --> 00:24:53.730
denounced because of its
architecture,

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:57.669
standing on Montmartre,
the butte of Montmartre,

00:24:57.669 --> 00:25:02.699
was there as a sign of penance
because of the Franco-Prussian

00:25:02.699 --> 00:25:05.175
war.
But the cities were basically

00:25:05.175 --> 00:25:08.350
lost to the Catholic Church,
with some exceptions.

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:11.986
But so were huge regions.
The Île-de-France,

00:25:11.986 --> 00:25:15.670
the area around Paris,
here, the Île-de-France,

00:25:15.670 --> 00:25:18.131
as it's called,
because you can imagine it kind

00:25:18.131 --> 00:25:21.396
of vaguely as an island because
of all these rivers--extremely

00:25:21.396 --> 00:25:23.496
de-Christianized.
The Limousin,

00:25:23.496 --> 00:25:26.650
around Limoges,
totally de-Christianized.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.269
The southwest,
absolutely, I forgot to mention

00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:32.470
that where Bernadette of Lourdes
saw the Virgin Mary,

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:34.839
that that part of the Pyrenees
was still very Christianized.

00:25:34.839 --> 00:25:39.890
Provence, much of Provence,
very de-Christianized as well.

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:43.042
And, as I said before,
the Bourbonnais--you don't have

00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:46.076
to know these regions,
just know something about the

00:25:46.076 --> 00:25:48.736
big ones.
So, there are big regional

00:25:48.736 --> 00:25:54.967
disparities in this.
And this is background to the

00:25:54.967 --> 00:26:01.460
separation of church and state
in 1905.

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:05.090
And two of the various laws
that you can read in Sowerwine's

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.351
book, the anti-clerical
legislation that really starts

00:26:08.351 --> 00:26:11.018
in 1878,
1879, that will lead to

00:26:11.018 --> 00:26:15.629
expulsion of some of the
religious orders and eventually

00:26:15.629 --> 00:26:19.569
the de-coupling of church and
state in 1905.

00:26:19.569 --> 00:26:21.696
Now, this, to be sure,
is a rather pessimistic,

00:26:21.696 --> 00:26:23.500
from the point of view of the
church,

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.702
assessment, and perhaps overly
so, because there has been

00:26:27.702 --> 00:26:31.980
recent work that has described
in many parts of France,

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.012
and in parts of Catholic
Germany also,

00:26:35.012 --> 00:26:39.274
a revival of intense
religiosity that has a lot to do

00:26:39.274 --> 00:26:43.073
with miracles.
Now, in the Catholic Church,

00:26:43.073 --> 00:26:48.300
in bad times sometimes miracles
come along to kind of rescue the

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.059
church,
and the case of Bernadette of

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:54.720
Lourdes, before this course,
in 1856, was one of them.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.456
Lourdes becomes one of the
first tourist sites in France,

00:26:58.456 --> 00:27:00.992
after Paris,
because these--it's always

00:27:00.992 --> 00:27:03.320
young girls,
by the way, always,

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.839
who see the Virgin Mary;
never young boys it's always

00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:11.482
young girls, that's interesting.
The case of Marpingen in the

00:27:11.482 --> 00:27:15.250
Saar in what,
1876, appear in Germany too.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.815
It comes along at a good time
for the Catholic Church--or

00:27:18.815 --> 00:27:20.789
Fatima, in Portugal,
in 1917.

00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:23.235
It's always young,
illiterate shepherd girls who

00:27:23.235 --> 00:27:25.791
see the Virgin Mary.
And then what happens is they

00:27:25.791 --> 00:27:27.739
interview them,
they bring translators to

00:27:27.739 --> 00:27:29.297
interview them,
as in the case of

00:27:29.297 --> 00:27:32.625
Bernadette--"what did you see?"
And they stick to their stories

00:27:32.625 --> 00:27:34.659
and pretty soon,
the bishops are a little

00:27:34.659 --> 00:27:37.217
skeptical,
and then they seize upon the

00:27:37.217 --> 00:27:40.809
moment and this becomes God is
telling us something,

00:27:40.809 --> 00:27:43.819
that we have sinned and the
Virgin Mary is looking after us.

00:27:43.819 --> 00:27:48.383
So, it revives--it happened
also in the 1830s near Grenoble,

00:27:48.383 --> 00:27:52.406
or was it was the '40s,
a place called La Salette--it

00:27:52.406 --> 00:27:55.983
is a sort of classic.
And then, as I said the other

00:27:55.983 --> 00:27:58.759
day, talking about the
railroads, the first and,

00:27:58.759 --> 00:28:01.158
for many people,
only railroad trip they ever

00:28:01.158 --> 00:28:04.483
took, people that in the 1870s
and the 1880s who didn't have a

00:28:04.483 --> 00:28:06.690
lot of money,
is to where?

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:11.754
To Lourdes, to get--if they're
sick to try to be healed or to

00:28:11.754 --> 00:28:14.499
buy holy water.
I just saw something the other

00:28:14.499 --> 00:28:16.725
day, that they had a big
confrontation in an airport

00:28:16.725 --> 00:28:19.388
because they refused to let them
carry holy water on the plane

00:28:19.388 --> 00:28:21.920
because it was bigger than a
mini tube of toothpaste;

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.381
you know how they take away,
you can only have little

00:28:24.381 --> 00:28:27.316
bottles instead of big bottles,
and it even happened on a papal

00:28:27.316 --> 00:28:30.518
airplane or something like that.
So, we live in a very different

00:28:30.518 --> 00:28:32.328
world now.
They didn't have to worry about

00:28:32.328 --> 00:28:34.059
that stuff at the time of these
miracles.

00:28:34.059 --> 00:28:38.731
But pilgrimages to Lourdes from
every diocese in France is still

00:28:38.731 --> 00:28:41.549
something that you see all the
time.

00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:45.008
But regional,
these regional outlines remain

00:28:45.008 --> 00:28:47.099
very, very true,
indeed.

00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:52.013
So, in 1905 what happens is the
church and the state get

00:28:52.013 --> 00:28:57.462
separated, that the clergy are
going to be pretty much left on

00:28:57.462 --> 00:29:03.018
their own now,
that the state has control over

00:29:03.018 --> 00:29:08.623
religious buildings,
and this is bad news for

00:29:08.623 --> 00:29:12.914
priests and for nuns.
Now when I--I admitted one

00:29:12.914 --> 00:29:15.480
thing when I was talking about
the religious revival,

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.971
and this is something that goes
very--goes back to the

00:29:17.971 --> 00:29:20.885
early--well not the early days
but it goes back at least to the

00:29:20.885 --> 00:29:23.026
sixteenth century,
and probably earlier if I

00:29:23.026 --> 00:29:24.663
knew--yes, earlier,
earlier than that,

00:29:24.663 --> 00:29:26.390
it goes back to the medieval
period.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:30.367
Now, the Roman Catholics' view
of women had left them pretty

00:29:30.367 --> 00:29:32.524
much in a state of
subordination,

00:29:32.524 --> 00:29:35.759
and that's always pretty much
been the case.

00:29:35.759 --> 00:29:38.304
I went to a school that was a
Jesuit school,

00:29:38.304 --> 00:29:41.737
as I said, that only--it was
mostly a sports factory and it

00:29:41.737 --> 00:29:45.169
only had--and that's kind of
what I did--and it didn't have

00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:47.547
women;
that was--they were just out

00:29:47.547 --> 00:29:50.298
there somewhere.
And we used to like to go to

00:29:50.298 --> 00:29:53.279
a--if you can imagine me as a
failed altar boy,

00:29:53.279 --> 00:29:55.834
you're looking at one,
but we used to like to go out

00:29:55.834 --> 00:29:58.889
to the girls school and help the
priests with the mass and all

00:29:58.889 --> 00:30:00.694
that,
just to have a look at these

00:30:00.694 --> 00:30:02.920
women who we had basically never
seen before.

00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:06.014
But one of the things that
happens, happened in the

00:30:06.014 --> 00:30:09.693
Catholic Church very early,
is that every time there's a

00:30:09.693 --> 00:30:13.259
new kind of spurt of religious
adherence and belief,

00:30:13.259 --> 00:30:16.651
is that convents,
female convents,

00:30:16.651 --> 00:30:21.380
the religious orders,
are one of the places,

00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.215
one of the only places that
women, smart,

00:30:25.215 --> 00:30:29.722
upwardly mobile women,
can rise and have careers

00:30:29.722 --> 00:30:35.380
worthy of their intelligence and
organizational skills,

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.282
if you think about it.
And so it's easy looking back

00:30:38.282 --> 00:30:41.910
from our secular age and kind of
dissing all these people,

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:46.703
mumbling up in the mountains
someplace, or not speaking at

00:30:46.703 --> 00:30:51.779
all, in some cases,
and just simply praying all the

00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:54.451
time.
But what is often forgotten is

00:30:54.451 --> 00:30:58.175
for women who couldn't possibly
do more than simply bear

00:30:58.175 --> 00:31:02.035
children and do the best they
could in those circumstances

00:31:02.035 --> 00:31:05.353
because the strictures of
society didn't give them

00:31:05.353 --> 00:31:08.648
opportunity.
These convents actually have an

00:31:08.648 --> 00:31:12.730
important role in their lives,
that is often simply forgotten.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:16.868
And the role of women teachers,
even though many of them were

00:31:16.868 --> 00:31:19.966
barely educated,
in very many parts of France

00:31:19.966 --> 00:31:23.480
that were still practicing,
like our part of France,

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:26.913
it was extremely important.
And they had what they

00:31:26.913 --> 00:31:29.488
called--they don't call them
obviously grandfather rules--but

00:31:29.488 --> 00:31:31.289
they had essentially grandmother
rules,

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:34.526
a phrase they didn't use,
that meant that these teachers

00:31:34.526 --> 00:31:36.940
who were female teachers who
were nuns,

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.634
who were allowed to teach in
the public schools until they

00:31:40.634 --> 00:31:44.523
died, and they were given that
dignity to be able to stay and

00:31:44.523 --> 00:31:49.033
teach there.
And their teaching was valued

00:31:49.033 --> 00:31:53.296
for what they did.
And so again what one has

00:31:53.296 --> 00:31:57.190
to--has to keep all these things
in perspective.

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:59.744
And for example there was a
woman, a friend of mine who did

00:31:59.744 --> 00:32:02.160
a book, a long time ago,
which feminists just mauled,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.700
they couldn't stand it,
but it's a very important book;

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:07.465
because what she looked at,
the sort of upper class ladies

00:32:07.465 --> 00:32:09.406
in the north,
such as those people you're

00:32:09.406 --> 00:32:11.832
going to read about in
Germinal--so that's a

00:32:11.832 --> 00:32:14.405
nice transition,
a vaguely nice transition--and

00:32:14.405 --> 00:32:17.615
that one of the things that they
were able to do because of their

00:32:17.615 --> 00:32:20.625
intense religiosity was organize
their own households in ways

00:32:20.625 --> 00:32:23.561
that they wanted to,
with crucifixes and statues of

00:32:23.561 --> 00:32:25.914
the Virgin Mary and all this
kind of stuff,

00:32:25.914 --> 00:32:28.884
and that they carved out their
own separate sphere and

00:32:28.884 --> 00:32:31.630
participated in their charitable
activities.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.146
So, from the point of view of
the Catholic Church,

00:32:34.146 --> 00:32:37.462
or for religiosity in general,
religious practice,

00:32:37.462 --> 00:32:42.039
all the news is not bad,
but indeed most of it was.

00:32:42.039 --> 00:32:46.606
And having said what I've said,
it's easy for you to,

00:32:46.606 --> 00:32:50.559
if I ask you this,
to say in what regions were

00:32:50.559 --> 00:32:56.180
people mad as hell about the
separation of church and state,

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.107
and about the inventories that
followed in 1906,

00:32:59.107 --> 00:33:01.350
you would already know the
answer.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:04.944
Now, what were the inventories?
The inventories were where they

00:33:04.944 --> 00:33:07.380
sent some state inspector around
who's going to say,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.406
"we're going to look at all the
paintings in this church and to

00:33:10.406 --> 00:33:13.210
assess their value."
Now, even in very modest

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:17.102
villages, of almost no means,
they all had some sort of

00:33:17.102 --> 00:33:19.359
paintings,
often just terrible art,

00:33:19.359 --> 00:33:22.000
but you never know,
maybe you're going to stagger

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.200
into a Rubens or something like
that,

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.298
purely by accident,
on the border of Flanders,

00:33:27.298 --> 00:33:29.640
of Belgium--you don't know
that.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.740
And so they sent around these
inspectors.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.601
And in many cases the faithful
lock themselves in the church,

00:33:38.601 --> 00:33:42.517
they barricade the church,
and then they have to bring

00:33:42.517 --> 00:33:46.300
soldiers in, and this was kind
of bad, the soldiers are camping

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:49.960
in fields near the church,
then they have to conscript

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:53.670
locksmiths, from the towns,
to come and force open the

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:55.944
locks.
And in many cases that doesn't

00:33:55.944 --> 00:33:58.740
work, so they have to bring
people with huge axes.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:01.697
So, again, from the point of
view of the church,

00:34:01.697 --> 00:34:04.779
this is the martyrdom of Saint
Sebastian again,

00:34:04.779 --> 00:34:08.678
this is the martyrdom of
ordinary people at the hands of

00:34:08.678 --> 00:34:11.826
a cruel, secularizing,
centralized state,

00:34:11.826 --> 00:34:16.650
working against the interests
of ordinary religious people.

00:34:16.650 --> 00:34:19.538
Now, to be sure,
the Catholic Church had not

00:34:19.538 --> 00:34:23.164
done itself any great favors
with the Papal Syllabus of

00:34:23.164 --> 00:34:26.119
Errors in 1864 that said that
modernity,

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:28.526
liberalism, democracy,
helping workers,

00:34:28.526 --> 00:34:31.376
anything, was bad,
and it made the church look

00:34:31.376 --> 00:34:34.870
pretty ridiculous.
And also, there was a huge

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:39.717
controversy then over a papal
pronouncement in 1871 that said

00:34:39.717 --> 00:34:43.757
that when the Pope puts on a
certain hat that he is

00:34:43.757 --> 00:34:47.210
infallible,
infallible.

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:49.490
Now, we don't pay attention to
this now, nobody pays attention

00:34:49.490 --> 00:34:51.435
to this now, I guess,
I had completely forgotten

00:34:51.435 --> 00:34:53.648
about it, but at that time,
what if the Pope puts on a

00:34:53.648 --> 00:34:56.552
certain hat and says,
"you'll be excommunicated and

00:34:56.552 --> 00:35:00.750
burn in hell forever if you vote
for a Liberal or a Socialist"?

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.480
Voilà.
So, what's that going to do?

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.929
So the church didn't do itself
any favors in being provocative.

00:35:06.929 --> 00:35:11.302
But by 1905 and 1906,
the Catholic Church in the wake

00:35:11.302 --> 00:35:14.665
of the Dreyfus Affair,
more about that another time,

00:35:14.665 --> 00:35:16.800
where the Catholic Church went
after Dreyfus;

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.929
it was better that he be
guilty, even if he wasn't

00:35:19.929 --> 00:35:23.442
guilty, because he was a Jew.
By then you have this

00:35:23.442 --> 00:35:26.799
ralliement,
or rallying of the church to

00:35:26.799 --> 00:35:30.800
the Republic as an institution,
and so things should have been

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.994
better, when they go around and
knock on the door and try to get

00:35:33.994 --> 00:35:36.249
into these churches.
But they weren't,

00:35:36.249 --> 00:35:39.710
and people barricaded
themselves into these churches.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:43.489
And so I got interested in
this, and, for example,

00:35:43.489 --> 00:35:47.311
in our particular village,
one of the things that people

00:35:47.311 --> 00:35:50.289
told--were passed down
generation after generation,

00:35:50.289 --> 00:35:53.937
is that the troops had been
bivouaced in the field behind

00:35:53.937 --> 00:35:56.869
the new church,
which had been started in 1896

00:35:56.869 --> 00:35:59.539
to replace the old Romanesque
church,

00:35:59.539 --> 00:36:01.208
which is disaffected or
désaff

00:36:01.208 --> 00:36:02.920
ecté,
whatever you call it,

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.479
taken out of commission,
right across from where we

00:36:06.479 --> 00:36:09.540
live, actually,
and that the troops had come

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:13.670
with axes and had broken down
the doors of the church,

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:17.124
and that people had gone home
with pieces of the door,

00:36:17.124 --> 00:36:20.840
cherishing them as you would a
piece of the true cross,

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:26.163
on which Christ was crucified.
And this was handed down from

00:36:26.163 --> 00:36:29.894
generation to generation,
and people talked about it as

00:36:29.894 --> 00:36:33.970
if they had been there--even
folks who hadn't been to church

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:37.543
in ages and ages.
Now, I got interested in this,

00:36:37.543 --> 00:36:40.760
because I was writing a book
about this place,

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.455
and so I went to all the
archives, of course,

00:36:43.455 --> 00:36:45.599
and I went to all the
newspapers,

00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:49.236
the Catholic newspaper and to a
very anti-clerical socialist

00:36:49.236 --> 00:36:52.750
newspaper, and I read the
accounts of all the incidents in

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.583
which that happened,
in all these other villages,

00:36:55.583 --> 00:36:58.629
in this part of France in which
tensions between Protestants and

00:36:58.629 --> 00:37:01.384
Catholics had always been very
high because of the wars of

00:37:01.384 --> 00:37:03.269
religion in the sixteenth
century,

00:37:03.269 --> 00:37:06.090
the seventeenth century,
and in the eighteenth century.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:10.116
And what I discovered was that
the event never happened,

00:37:10.116 --> 00:37:13.630
it never happened,
that there were no troops ever

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:17.802
bivouaced outside of the church
in this particular village

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:21.864
called Balazuc,
and that there was never a time

00:37:21.864 --> 00:37:26.179
that the door was bashed down by
soldiers with axes,

00:37:26.179 --> 00:37:31.666
to look at the modest paintings
on the walls of this poor church

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:35.150
whose parishioners had almost
nothing.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.289
The event never happened,
it did not happen.

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:42.730
But nonetheless in their
imaginaire,

00:37:42.730 --> 00:37:49.389
or in their--the constitution
of their memory it had a place,

00:37:49.389 --> 00:37:52.788
which is that they were
defending their church against

00:37:52.788 --> 00:37:56.400
these forces from the outside,
rather like the case of our

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.480
school, that they couldn't
control.

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:04.949
So it had a place there,
even though it never happened.

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:08.809
It could've happened but it
just didn't, it never happened.

00:38:08.809 --> 00:38:12.146
So what's the point of all
that--is that separation of

00:38:12.146 --> 00:38:15.168
church and state was
extraordinarily wrenching in

00:38:15.168 --> 00:38:17.750
areas that were not
de-Christianized,

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:21.919
although there were instances
in some of the other ones as

00:38:21.919 --> 00:38:26.307
well, and that people simply got
by as best they could in the

00:38:26.307 --> 00:38:30.622
church continuing to draw people
on Sundays and to religious

00:38:30.622 --> 00:38:35.404
holidays,
and that--which was the case in

00:38:35.404 --> 00:38:39.565
our village.
And our village had a priest,

00:38:39.565 --> 00:38:45.065
the last one who was denigrated
as a red-haired ladies' man by

00:38:45.065 --> 00:38:49.180
some of his enemies,
he left I think--well we got

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.679
there 20 years ago,
so about four years before we

00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:55.881
were there.
And as I said the other day in

00:38:55.881 --> 00:39:00.097
the context of the schools,
the Catholic Church now is just

00:39:00.097 --> 00:39:04.460
a voluntary association in our
particular part of France,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.533
like any other one.
There are no more people from

00:39:08.533 --> 00:39:13.000
our village who go to that
church than will turn up at X,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.728
to play bingo for the school,
far fewer, from that point of

00:39:18.728 --> 00:39:20.800
view.
But it doesn't mean that the

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.806
church doesn't have some place
in the collective memory of the

00:39:23.806 --> 00:39:25.487
place,
even a lot of it is imaginary

00:39:25.487 --> 00:39:27.943
or some of it's imaginary.
Once there was a huge

00:39:27.943 --> 00:39:31.418
windstorm, as there frequently
is, and we always have the

00:39:31.418 --> 00:39:34.831
rivers--in fact it was the
22^(nd) of September 15 years

00:39:34.831 --> 00:39:38.121
ago the river rose so
dramatically it killed about 200

00:39:38.121 --> 00:39:39.918
people,
not in our part,

00:39:39.918 --> 00:39:42.937
not our particular river,
but across the Rhône,

00:39:42.937 --> 00:39:45.260
when a big storm came and the
statue,

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.958
this rather ugly statue of the
Virgin Mary crashed to the

00:39:47.958 --> 00:39:50.030
ground and broke into one
hundred pieces,

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:52.684
or 1,000 pieces.
In the café

00:39:52.684 --> 00:39:55.832
that's open all year they put
up a bowl and people who are

00:39:55.832 --> 00:39:59.091
very anti-Clerical always put
money into the bowl to rebuild

00:39:59.091 --> 00:40:02.703
this statue,
because people care that this

00:40:02.703 --> 00:40:07.199
voluntary association remain;
and that it's still--in the

00:40:07.199 --> 00:40:10.659
Catholic Church you call them
four-wheeled Catholics,

00:40:10.659 --> 00:40:14.936
people still will go there for
baptism, for burial--not in this

00:40:14.936 --> 00:40:19.075
order--and for marriage.
And I have assisted at,

00:40:19.075 --> 00:40:23.155
with my family,
combined baptism/marriage

00:40:23.155 --> 00:40:28.968
ceremonies where a couple will
marry years and years after

00:40:28.968 --> 00:40:32.591
having children,
which is pretty usual actually

00:40:32.591 --> 00:40:35.010
in our part of France,
among many of our fiends,

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.964
and they're still very much
couples, they just never got

00:40:36.964 --> 00:40:38.475
married.
In France, in Paris in the

00:40:38.475 --> 00:40:41.185
nineteenth century a quarter of
all couples who lived together

00:40:41.185 --> 00:40:43.760
weren't actually married.
It wasn't that they were just

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:46.284
defying organized religion,
it was that they didn't have

00:40:46.284 --> 00:40:48.833
money to pay to have a marriage.
And if you ever read

00:40:48.833 --> 00:40:51.192
L'Assommoir,
when they do get married--Zola,

00:40:51.192 --> 00:40:54.296
one of his other great novels,
when they go down to the Louvre

00:40:54.296 --> 00:40:56.840
it's one of the great scenes in
French literature,

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:00.100
so far as I know.
So, but the trouble with the

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.701
Catholic Church in France is of
course there's no priests

00:41:03.701 --> 00:41:06.210
anymore, and just end with it
there;

00:41:06.210 --> 00:41:10.516
that something like I read in
Libé or one of the

00:41:10.516 --> 00:41:14.892
newspapers that well over half
of all the priests in France now

00:41:14.892 --> 00:41:17.506
are--oh,
sixty-five percent of them are

00:41:17.506 --> 00:41:20.451
over sixty years old,
and something like forty-five

00:41:20.451 --> 00:41:23.387
percent are over seventy,
and there are almost no

00:41:23.387 --> 00:41:26.690
religious vocations at all,
even from religious areas now.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:31.041
So, because churches do provide
charity still and help organize

00:41:31.041 --> 00:41:34.550
lives for very elderly people,
this is very sad.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:37.285
And even Voltaire,
who once said that if God

00:41:37.285 --> 00:41:41.292
didn't exist he or she should be
invented so that he wouldn't be

00:41:41.292 --> 00:41:43.710
cheated by his wife or his
tailor,

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:47.178
even Voltaire would have agreed
that the church,

00:41:47.178 --> 00:41:51.090
churches still in France fill
some useful function.

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:54.041
But these regional contrasts
are still extraordinarily

00:41:54.041 --> 00:41:55.989
important in
de-Christianization,

00:41:55.989 --> 00:41:59.855
helped define the evolving
politics of La Belle

00:41:59.855 --> 00:42:04.430
France.Apologies again for
this colossal mess about the

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:06.116
room;
we will take care of this as

00:42:06.116 --> 00:42:07.789
soon as possible,
like in the next ten minutes.

00:42:07.789 --> 00:42:10.960
So have a great weekend,
and have fun in section.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.960
See ya.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.034
Professor Amy
Hungerford: I started last

00:00:04.034 --> 00:00:06.953
time, and actually my whole
lecture existed under the rubric

00:00:06.953 --> 00:00:09.268
of,
this quotation from Sabbath

00:00:09.268 --> 00:00:13.350
Lily Hawks, and I'm just going
to read it to you again.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.538
"I like his eyes.
They don't look like they see

00:00:17.538 --> 00:00:20.560
what he's looking at,
but they keep on looking."

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.822
So, last time I suggested that
what O'Connor asks us to see in

00:00:25.822 --> 00:00:30.394
her fiction is a theological
structure and a religious

00:00:30.394 --> 00:00:33.768
message.
What I started to suggest at

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:38.945
the end of class--as I gave you
the catalog of body parts lying

00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:42.870
around the text--what I began to
suggest is,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.123
that if we actually see what
we're looking at rather than,

00:00:49.123 --> 00:00:54.170
like Haze, not seeing what
we're looking at,

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.803
we begin to see something
that's harder to assimilate to

00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:05.129
that neat theology that
O'Connor's letters and essays

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.995
point us towards.
One kind of question,

00:01:08.995 --> 00:01:13.407
then, I was raising is:
what context do you use to read

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.697
any novel?
And today I'm going to suggest

00:01:16.697 --> 00:01:19.593
two--actually,
well, yes--two additional

00:01:19.593 --> 00:01:23.379
contexts that we can look to,
to read the novel.

00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:28.170
And I will let you know what
those are when they come,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.826
but be looking for that.
So, two hundred people show

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:37.560
up to see Asa Hawks blind
himself.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.724
That's what we're told.
That's what the newspaper

00:01:40.724 --> 00:01:46.773
clipping tells us.
We show up to see O'Connor take

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:51.888
her characters apart.
I began that catalog of body

00:01:51.888 --> 00:01:55.249
parts.
Today I'm going to extend and

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.791
embellish the catalog of
suffering and distortion that we

00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:05.374
see in this novel.
And, just to remind you of that

00:02:05.374 --> 00:02:09.818
catalog, I just want to look at
page 43 in your edition,

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:14.080
47 in mine.
I noted that a lot of the body

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.340
parts that we see in her prose
are parts of women's bodies.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.555
Well, the sense of the body as
grotesque goes beyond just

00:02:24.555 --> 00:02:27.679
dismemberment.
There's a general ugliness of

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:29.930
women that pertains in the
novel.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.158
And if you look on that page,
about in the middle,

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:37.782
this is Enoch describing his
foster mother:

00:02:37.782 --> 00:02:41.580
"'This woman was hard to get
along with.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.254
She wasn't old.
I reckon she was 40 year old,

00:02:45.254 --> 00:02:49.238
but she sho was ugly.
She had theseyer brown glasses

00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:52.637
and her hair was so thin it
looked like ham gravy trickling

00:02:52.637 --> 00:02:56.979
over her skull.'"
Okay. It's funny a little bit.

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:00.523
It's a picturesque comparison,
hair and gravy,

00:03:00.523 --> 00:03:03.199
but it emphasizes that
ugliness.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:08.363
Now, if you look on page 80 (84
in my edition),

00:03:08.363 --> 00:03:14.199
this is a woman climbing out of
the swimming pool.

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.162
Remember when Haze and Enoch
are in the middle of the park at

00:03:17.162 --> 00:03:19.948
the swimming pool.
Enoch's hiding in the bushes,

00:03:19.948 --> 00:03:25.150
spying on the women.
Here's one climbing out of the

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.629
pool:
First her face appeared,

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.997
long and cadaverous,
with a bandage-like bathing cap

00:03:32.997 --> 00:03:38.153
coming down almost to her eyes,
and sharp teeth protruding from

00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:40.966
her mouth.
Then she rose on her hands,

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:44.849
until a large foot and leg came
up from behind her,

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.000
and another on the other side,
and she was out,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.849
squatting there,
panting.

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.045
She stood up loosely and shook
herself and stamped in the water

00:03:54.045 --> 00:03:58.083
dripping off of her.
She comports herself like a dog

00:03:58.083 --> 00:03:59.506
in this scene.
Okay.

00:03:59.506 --> 00:04:04.068
So she shakes-- as if she had
fur to shake--but register the

00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:08.629
weirdness of this sentence:
"Then she rose on her hands,

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.580
until a large foot and leg came
up from behind her."

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.250
It's as if they're sneaking up
behind her.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.058
It's as if they're separate
from her, not part of her body

00:04:17.058 --> 00:04:20.037
at all.
So, even when you see O'Connor

00:04:20.037 --> 00:04:24.792
describing these emergence of a
body from the water--a moment

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:29.310
when you'd think the whole body
would be most on view,

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.958
or most pertinent to describe--
what you have is almost a

00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:38.170
distortion of our senses,
a distortion of vision,

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.394
so that we see--even in a woman
climbing out of the water--her

00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:47.707
legs,
her feet, as dismembered from

00:04:47.707 --> 00:04:51.709
the rest of her body.
There is a critic at the

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:55.259
University of Michigan.
Her name is Patricia Yaeger.

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.428
She wrote a very compelling
argument about O'Connor's

00:04:58.428 --> 00:05:01.475
fiction--not about Wise Blood
in particular,

00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:05.552
but about her stories.
And in that essay she argues

00:05:05.552 --> 00:05:10.983
that O'Connor's grotesqueness,
especially the grotesqueness of

00:05:10.983 --> 00:05:16.654
the women figures in her novels,
is all wrapped up with the

00:05:16.654 --> 00:05:22.133
culture of southern womanhood.
It's a culture of beauty that

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:27.253
requires all kinds of grooming
practices to form and shape the

00:05:27.253 --> 00:05:32.204
body in such a way that it can
appear socially in a decorous

00:05:32.204 --> 00:05:36.067
way.
So, Yaeger argues that what we

00:05:36.067 --> 00:05:42.386
see in scenes like this is the
registration of the violence of

00:05:42.386 --> 00:05:47.576
those practices of beauty.
So she does not let these

00:05:47.576 --> 00:05:52.475
things sit in the text to be
assimilated to a theological

00:05:52.475 --> 00:05:55.800
structure, but she brings them
out.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.019
And by reading things like
contemporaneous autobiographies

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:04.089
from southern women that she's
chosen from the canon,

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:09.153
and just accounts of what was
required of women (etiquette and

00:06:09.153 --> 00:06:14.051
so on), she weaves a reading of
passages like this into that

00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:19.032
kind of context to suggest that
O'Connor's vision of violence

00:06:19.032 --> 00:06:23.846
has more to do with being a
woman in the South than it does

00:06:23.846 --> 00:06:28.246
with the stated religious
concerns that O'Connor talks

00:06:28.246 --> 00:06:31.969
about in her letters.
Now, remember,

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:34.778
as I mentioned,
O'Connor suffered from lupus,

00:06:34.778 --> 00:06:37.459
and she was disfigured by this
disease.

00:06:37.459 --> 00:06:40.547
Especially, she was on crutches
for a long time,

00:06:40.547 --> 00:06:43.700
and for periods of time could
not walk at all.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.303
Her legs would swell up.
There's a lot of imagery of

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:52.857
swelling, of distortion and
distention of the body that some

00:06:52.857 --> 00:06:56.329
critics point to her biography
to explain.

00:06:56.329 --> 00:06:59.721
They look at her experience of
her own body and,

00:06:59.721 --> 00:07:03.401
when you think about Yaeger's
argument--that kind of

00:07:03.401 --> 00:07:07.803
distortion of the body in the
context of a social culture that

00:07:07.803 --> 00:07:12.277
really emphasizes the control of
a woman's body--then you begin

00:07:12.277 --> 00:07:16.606
to see the power of the tension
that we can read into moments

00:07:16.606 --> 00:07:19.637
like this.
But I would suggest,

00:07:19.637 --> 00:07:24.241
and actually Yaeger suggests
this too, that the violence of

00:07:24.241 --> 00:07:29.321
southern culture goes way beyond
just the violence of the culture

00:07:29.321 --> 00:07:32.235
of femininity,
the culture of the southern

00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:35.006
woman.
And so, let's look a little bit

00:07:35.006 --> 00:07:38.634
and extend the catalog.
Another category of

00:07:38.634 --> 00:07:43.237
violence we have is murdered
children, murdered and also just

00:07:43.237 --> 00:07:46.690
generally neglected or abandoned
children.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.320
Enoch, if you'll recall,
was traded by his father off to

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.520
the Bible woman with the gravy
hair;

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.379
so that bespeaks the pain.
And last time I read you a

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:03.895
passage where Enoch begins to
tell that story in this very

00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:07.540
pitiful way, getting no sympathy
from Haze.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:12.779
So, clearly he feels the
abandonment from his father.

00:08:12.779 --> 00:08:19.063
If you look at page 120 in your
edition (122 if anyone has

00:08:19.063 --> 00:08:25.678
mine), this is a little story
that Sabbath Lily tells to Haze

00:08:25.678 --> 00:08:31.189
while they are supposedly
seducing each other.

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:32.710
(Don't try this on your next
date;

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:37.470
I don't think it works very
well.) So this was her story:

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:39.932
 "There was this child
once," she said,

00:08:39.932 --> 00:08:43.178
turning over on her stomach,
"that nobody cared if it lived

00:08:43.178 --> 00:08:45.606
or died.
Its kin sent it around from one

00:08:45.606 --> 00:08:48.893
to another of them and finally
to its grandmother who was a

00:08:48.893 --> 00:08:51.498
very evil woman,
and she couldn't stand to have

00:08:51.498 --> 00:08:54.505
it around because the least good
thing made her break out in

00:08:54.505 --> 00:08:57.167
these welps.
She would get all itchy and

00:08:57.167 --> 00:08:59.021
swole.
Even her eyes would itch her

00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:01.939
and swell up and there wasn't
nothing she could do but run up

00:09:01.939 --> 00:09:04.419
and down the road shaking her
hands and cursing,

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:06.679
and it was twicet as bad when
this child was there.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:10.100
So she kept the child locked up
in a chicken crate.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:13.159
It seen its granny in hell fire
swole and burning,

00:09:13.159 --> 00:09:15.470
and it told her everything it
seen,

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:19.480
and she got so swole until
finally she went to the well and

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.906
wrapped the well rope around her
neck and let down the bucket and

00:09:23.906 --> 00:09:26.570
broke her neck.
Would you guess me to be

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.899
fifteen year old?"
she asked [seductively].

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:32.496
Okay.
Yes, very romantic story

00:09:32.496 --> 00:09:35.629
Sabbath tells to our friend
Haze.

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:41.420
These images of babies
abandoned: here it's called an

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.186
"it."
Children are often called "it"

00:09:44.186 --> 00:09:47.340
in O'Connor's fiction.
Especially, I would note,

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.190
if they are female children,
they're normally called "it."

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:58.150
Lily herself is a child who is
completely unloved by her

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.477
father.
Her father just wants to get

00:10:01.477 --> 00:10:06.087
rid of her and is willing to
collude with her to try to make

00:10:06.087 --> 00:10:11.308
Haze take her off his hands.
And remember the story of her

00:10:11.308 --> 00:10:14.762
naming.
Her mother gave birth to her on

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:20.214
a Sunday and right after she was
born gave her the name Sabbath,

00:10:20.214 --> 00:10:23.330
then turned on her side and
died.

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:28.494
So poor Lily is also an orphan,
at least in the emotional

00:10:28.494 --> 00:10:33.356
sense, if not in actual reality.
Her father, of course,

00:10:33.356 --> 00:10:37.517
had run off from her mother
right after she had gotten

00:10:37.517 --> 00:10:41.049
pregnant, and then I suppose he
came back.

00:10:41.049 --> 00:10:46.364
So, children are deeply abused
and neglected.What else do

00:10:46.364 --> 00:10:49.314
we have?
On 231, just to add to this

00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:52.831
catalog--we have murdered,
abandoned, neglected

00:10:52.831 --> 00:10:56.120
children--we also have police
brutality.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.471
(231. Now, let me see.
I may not have gotten the right

00:10:59.471 --> 00:11:03.280
page number for you guys for
this one.) This is right when

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.090
Haze has been found in the ditch
by the two policemen,

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:07.850
and maybe you recall it.

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:19.170
Haze asks whether it's day or
night.

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:22.065
This is the bottom of 230: 
"It's day," the thinner

00:11:22.065 --> 00:11:24.100
one, the cop,
said, looking at the sky.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.809
"We got to take you back to pay
your rent."

00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:29.899
"I want to go on where I'm
going," the blind man said.

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:32.709
"You got to pay your rent
first," the policeman said,

00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:35.469
"'ever bit of it."
The other, perceiving that he

00:11:35.469 --> 00:11:38.017
was conscious,
hit him over the head with his

00:11:38.017 --> 00:11:39.670
new billy.
"We don't want to have no

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.549
trouble with him," he said.
"You take his feet."

00:11:42.549 --> 00:11:45.715
He died in the squad car,
but they didn't notice,

00:11:45.715 --> 00:11:48.090
and took him on to the
landlady's.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.871
She had put him in her bed,
and when she had pushed them

00:11:50.871 --> 00:11:52.995
out the door,
she locked it behind them and

00:11:52.995 --> 00:11:56.232
drew up a straight chair and sat
down close to his face where she

00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:59.855
could talk to him.
Here this image of a

00:11:59.855 --> 00:12:05.329
man--obviously an indigent found
on the road and then

00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:10.803
gratuitously abused by the
police--echoes the earlier

00:12:10.803 --> 00:12:17.225
moment when the policeman pushes
his car off the road and down

00:12:17.225 --> 00:12:21.564
the hill.
These are instances where

00:12:21.564 --> 00:12:27.829
police are using their power
utterly on their own authority,

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:32.820
with seemingly no checks,
with excess force.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:38.440
Remember again:
this is the South.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:45.283
We all know that these kinds of
violence, official violence,

00:12:45.283 --> 00:12:51.546
were part and parcel of
southern culture toward African

00:12:51.546 --> 00:12:55.870
Americans.
What I think O'Connor is doing

00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:00.909
here is taking some of that
reality and injecting it into

00:13:00.909 --> 00:13:04.445
Haze's narrative.
So, these are the kinds of

00:13:04.445 --> 00:13:08.049
images that the Civil Rights
movement really brought to

00:13:08.049 --> 00:13:12.864
light.
Here we see them in relation to

00:13:12.864 --> 00:13:17.673
Haze.
But overt racism is there,

00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:25.925
too, and if you look on page 67
in your book--and this is on 71

00:13:25.925 --> 00:13:33.246
in mine--you will see that
O'Connor does not hesitate to

00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:41.100
use the word "nigger" in the
dialog of her characters.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.660
Now, the narrative voice does
not use that word,

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.250
but here it is on the bottom of
71.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:54.850
Her characters are perhaps
typical poor southerners:

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:56.839
"Well,
what do you want to pay for

00:13:56.839 --> 00:13:59.319
it?" the man asks.
[This is Haze buying his

00:13:59.319 --> 00:14:01.629
Essex.]
"I wouldn't trade me a Chrysler

00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:04.812
for an Essex like that.
That car yonder ain't been

00:14:04.812 --> 00:14:08.059
built by a bunch of niggers.
All the niggers are living in

00:14:08.059 --> 00:14:10.222
Detroit now putting cars
together," he said,

00:14:10.222 --> 00:14:13.029
making conversation.
"I was up there a while myself

00:14:13.029 --> 00:14:17.139
and seen.
I come home."

00:14:17.139 --> 00:14:22.187
She's invoking,
in a very casual way,

00:14:22.187 --> 00:14:30.039
the southern racism of the
poorer white working class.

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:33.319
This is just part of her
representation of the place,

00:14:33.319 --> 00:14:36.409
part of her representation of
these characters.

00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:39.720
It's a kind of realism,
of course.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.329
Nevertheless,
there it is in front of us,

00:14:42.329 --> 00:14:45.330
and again I call you back to
that quotation.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.480
What are we going to see when
we look at the fiction?

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.306
Do we see what's in front of us?
So, this is one of the things

00:14:54.306 --> 00:14:57.559
that O'Connor puts in front of
us.

00:14:57.559 --> 00:15:02.447
On page 174--Again,
check and see if this is the

00:15:02.447 --> 00:15:06.348
same in your edition.
Generally, annoyingly,

00:15:06.348 --> 00:15:09.570
it's sometimes four pages'
difference earlier;

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:13.194
sometimes it's two.
So I tried to get them all,

00:15:13.194 --> 00:15:15.960
but I think I didn't look this
one up;

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.470
this is Enoch stealing the new
Jesus:

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.903
He had darkened his face
and hands with brown shoe

00:15:23.903 --> 00:15:27.649
polish, so that if he were seen
in the act, he would be taken

00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:30.562
for a colored person.
Then he had sneaked into the

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:33.317
museum while the guard was
asleep and had broken the glass

00:15:33.317 --> 00:15:35.830
case with a wrench he borrowed
from his landlady.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.542
Then, shaking and sweating,
he had lifted the shriveled man

00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:41.909
out and thrust him in a paper
sack,

00:15:41.909 --> 00:15:45.379
and had crept out again past
the guard who was still asleep.

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:48.580
He realized as soon as he got
out of the museum that,

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.149
since no one had seen him to
think he was a colored boy,

00:15:52.149 --> 00:15:55.410
he would be suspected
immediately and would have to

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.348
disguise himself.
That was why he had on the

00:15:58.348 --> 00:16:00.700
black beard and dark
glasses.

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.267
Okay.
So, there's a certain sense of

00:16:02.267 --> 00:16:04.947
humor here.
So, Enoch goes in black face to

00:16:04.947 --> 00:16:08.061
commit the crime,
so that if he's seen he won't

00:16:08.061 --> 00:16:11.707
be taken for white,
but then he realizes a black

00:16:11.707 --> 00:16:15.019
person--just by definition--is
suspicious.

00:16:15.019 --> 00:16:18.751
So he has to now disguise
himself from being a black

00:16:18.751 --> 00:16:22.365
person.
This is partly Enoch's sort of

00:16:22.365 --> 00:16:28.669
craziness, but the joke relies
on the fact of racial profiling.

00:16:28.669 --> 00:16:33.009
It relies on the fact that it's
very plausible to think that at

00:16:33.009 --> 00:16:37.070
this moment in the South to walk
down the street as a black

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:39.888
person,
to drive a car as a black

00:16:39.888 --> 00:16:44.314
person, would be a risky
endeavor in some places in the

00:16:44.314 --> 00:16:46.918
city.
So, it's a joke,

00:16:46.918 --> 00:16:53.129
but it's a joke that rests on a
very dark reality.

00:16:53.129 --> 00:16:58.719
So, what you have,
then, is a set of things that

00:16:58.719 --> 00:17:02.665
are put before us,
that we are asked,

00:17:02.665 --> 00:17:06.940
in a way, not to respond
to.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.690
Let's look at one more example.
This is on page 159.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.590
This is a silly example.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.740
This is when Hoover
Shoates--and note in connection

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:26.195
with my lecture last time;
I talked to you about pigs,

00:17:26.195 --> 00:17:28.680
and why there are pigs all over
a landscape--well,

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:31.541
Hoover Shoates:
a shoat is a little pig,

00:17:31.541 --> 00:17:35.210
so she's continuing that
metaphor with his name,

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:41.375
or that trope with his name.
This is Haze being approached

00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:44.689
by Hoover Shoates:
"My name is Hoover

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:47.140
Shoates," the man with his head
in the door growled.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:51.050
"I know when I first seen you
that you wasn't nothin' but a

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.804
crackpot."
Haze opened the door enough to

00:17:53.804 --> 00:17:57.280
be able to slam it.
Hoover Shoates got his head out

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.756
of the way but not his thumb.
A howl arose that would have

00:18:01.756 --> 00:18:05.380
rended almost any heart.
Haze opened the door and

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:09.029
released the thumb and then
slammed the door again.

00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:12.930
"A howl arose that would rend
almost any heart."

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.900
What you want to ask about all
these things that I'm putting in

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.668
front of you is,
"Are these supposed to rend our

00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:25.074
hearts?"
I don't think we're meant to

00:18:25.074 --> 00:18:28.130
feel much for Hoover Shoates
here.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:34.510
He is a figure of critique.
He's a figure of satire.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:40.298
He's the charlatan preacher.
We're certainly not meant to

00:18:40.298 --> 00:18:44.258
identify with him or to
sympathize with him,

00:18:44.258 --> 00:18:49.506
but here you can't help but
thinking about someone getting

00:18:49.506 --> 00:18:57.280
their thumb smashed in a door.
And then it gets more intense

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:05.596
of course on page 206(and that's
204 in this edition),

00:19:05.596 --> 00:19:11.641
when Haze commits murder.
So here we have the murder

00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:12.150
scene:

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:18.727
"Take off that suit,"
Haze shouted and started the car

00:19:18.727 --> 00:19:21.700
forward after him.
Solace began to lope down the

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.009
road taking off his coat as he
went.

00:19:24.009 --> 00:19:27.921
"Take it all off," Haze yelled
with his face close to the

00:19:27.921 --> 00:19:30.772
windshield.
The prophet began to run in

00:19:30.772 --> 00:19:33.214
earnest.
He tore off his shirt and

00:19:33.214 --> 00:19:36.660
unbuckled his belt and ran out
of his trousers.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:40.192
He began grabbing for his feet
as if he would take off his

00:19:40.192 --> 00:19:43.910
shoes, too, but before he could
get at them the Essex knocked

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:47.588
him flat and ran over him.
Haze drove about twenty feet

00:19:47.588 --> 00:19:50.640
and stopped the car and then
began to back it.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:55.220
He backed it over the body and
then stopped and got out.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.460
The Essex stood half over the
other prophet as if it were

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.470
pleased to guard what it had
finally brought down.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:06.275
The man didn't look so much
like Haze lying on the ground on

00:20:06.275 --> 00:20:09.369
his face without his hat or suit
on.

00:20:09.369 --> 00:20:13.244
A lot of blood was coming out
of him and forming a puddle

00:20:13.244 --> 00:20:15.696
around his head.
He was motionless,

00:20:15.696 --> 00:20:19.449
all but for one finger that
moved up and down in front of

00:20:19.449 --> 00:20:22.599
his face as if he were marking
time with it.

00:20:22.599 --> 00:20:27.583
Haze poked his toe in his side,
and he wheezed for a second and

00:20:27.583 --> 00:20:30.965
then was quiet.
"Two things I can't stand,"

00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:35.221
Haze said, "a man that ain't
true, and one that mocks what

00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:37.152
is.
You shouldn't ever have

00:20:37.152 --> 00:20:40.440
tampered with me if you didn't
want what you got."

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.960
The man was trying to say
something, but he was only

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.666
wheezing.
Haze squatted down by his face

00:20:46.666 --> 00:20:48.985
to listen.
"I give my mother a lot of

00:20:48.985 --> 00:20:52.690
trouble," he said through a kind
of bubbling in his throat,

00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.268
"'never giv'er no rest,
stole theter car,

00:20:55.268 --> 00:20:58.750
never told the truth to my
daddy or give Henry what,

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.359
never give--" "You shut up,"
Haze said, leaning his head

00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:05.954
closer to hear the confession.
"Told where his still was and

00:21:05.954 --> 00:21:08.120
got five dollars for it," the
man gasped.

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.230
"You shut up now," Haze said.
"Jesus," the man said.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.120
"Shut up, now,
like I told you," Haze said.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:19.916
"Jesus hep me," the man wheezed.
Haze gave him a hard slap on

00:21:19.916 --> 00:21:26.036
the back and he was quiet.
How many of you when you read

00:21:26.036 --> 00:21:31.750
that felt like a character who
mattered to you had died?

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.710
Just a few;
you guys are exceptionally,

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.609
exceptionally sympathetic.
I commend you.

00:21:37.609 --> 00:21:41.460
It's hard to feel too much for
this prophet,

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:46.655
and I would argue that his
confession at the end is part of

00:21:46.655 --> 00:21:50.657
what makes it quite difficult.
It's such a,

00:21:50.657 --> 00:21:55.046
kind of, trivial set of things
that he begins to recite,

00:21:55.046 --> 00:21:58.078
or, at least,
he recites them in such a

00:21:58.078 --> 00:22:01.590
cliched way: "I gave my mother
trouble.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:07.632
I was a bad boy.
I took some money to tell where

00:22:07.632 --> 00:22:10.986
the still was."
These are such,

00:22:10.986 --> 00:22:15.991
sort of, clichéd
southernisms that you start to

00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:19.579
see this character as a
caricature.

00:22:19.579 --> 00:22:23.839
He is very hard to see as a
human being.

00:22:23.839 --> 00:22:28.856
And yet, I would contend that
the part about the Essex

00:22:28.856 --> 00:22:33.400
actually running over him is
quite compelling.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:36.200
At least I feel it when I read
it.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.094
In a more abstract sense,
I feel the violence of it when

00:22:41.094 --> 00:22:45.428
I read those passages.
So, there is a sense in

00:22:45.428 --> 00:22:49.255
which you have to ask:
Is this meant to rend our

00:22:49.255 --> 00:22:52.694
hearts?
If Hoover Shoates's thumb in

00:22:52.694 --> 00:22:57.100
the door doesn't quite do it,
does this do it?

00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:04.678
Does southern racism do it?
Does the dismemberment of women

00:23:04.678 --> 00:23:08.215
do it?
What is the point of putting

00:23:08.215 --> 00:23:12.355
these on the page?
And, if you think about the way

00:23:12.355 --> 00:23:15.834
some bodies literally explode,
think of the new

00:23:15.834 --> 00:23:19.390
Jesus--remember when Haze takes
that little,

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:26.077
shriveled body from Lily and
throws it against the wall,

00:23:26.077 --> 00:23:31.670
the head pops,
and out comes dust and trash.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:37.269
If bodies are exploding here,
why are we not asked to care?

00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:40.688
And, if we aren't asked to
care, what is it that we're

00:23:40.688 --> 00:23:44.299
asked to do, or to think,
in response to these things?

00:23:44.299 --> 00:23:47.042
Now, Patricia Yaeger,
in her argument,

00:23:47.042 --> 00:23:51.563
rejects what has typically been
offered up as a way to account

00:23:51.563 --> 00:23:54.501
for these things,
and that's the religious

00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:57.710
reading.
She says, to dismiss that

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:03.520
violence into an old and
comfortable theology is simply

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:07.354
not to see it,
not really to see it,

00:24:07.354 --> 00:24:12.986
not to notice that O'Connor put
it there in such a sharp and

00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:16.926
compelling form.
I want to change tack for a

00:24:16.926 --> 00:24:20.836
minute, and now I'm going to
veer into that second kind of

00:24:20.836 --> 00:24:24.609
context that I said I was going
to talk about today.

00:24:24.609 --> 00:24:29.816
There is something else I think
we're meant to see that is

00:24:29.816 --> 00:24:33.470
neither theology nor southern
context,

00:24:33.470 --> 00:24:38.849
and I want to show you that now
by looking at chapter 7;

00:24:38.849 --> 00:24:43.240
it starts on 115 in your book
(117 in this edition).

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:54.844
I just want to read the opening.
I'm going to treat this chapter

00:24:54.844 --> 00:25:01.579
as a sort of microcosm of the
book, with respect to its craft.

00:25:01.579 --> 00:25:05.740
Let's look at how this opens:
"The next afternoon when he got

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.306
his car back,
he drove it out into the

00:25:08.306 --> 00:25:12.119
country to see how well it
worked on the open road.

00:25:12.119 --> 00:25:16.480
The sky was just a little
lighter blue than his suit,

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:20.588
clear and even with only one
cloud in it, a large,

00:25:20.588 --> 00:25:24.529
blinding white one with curls
and a beard."

00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:30.150
Notice that image of the cloud,
the blinding white cloud.

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:34.710
It's very hard not to see it as
a symbol.

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:39.130
What kind of symbol is it?
Well, it's a God symbol.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:44.074
It's even got that typical
children's book iconography of

00:25:44.074 --> 00:25:47.259
the curls and the white beard.
Okay.

00:25:47.259 --> 00:25:51.351
So this is like your children's
book representation of the

00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:54.439
Christian God,
and there it is as a blinding

00:25:54.439 --> 00:25:57.485
white cloud.
You wouldn't even need the

00:25:57.485 --> 00:26:01.980
curls and the beard if you just
had the blinding and the white.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:03.773
And, of course,
as we go on,

00:26:03.773 --> 00:26:06.696
as I'll show you,
the curls and the beard are

00:26:06.696 --> 00:26:11.079
pared away, and you're left more
with that blinding whiteness.

00:26:11.079 --> 00:26:16.160
So, the blinding white
cloud begins this chapter.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:19.922
And what happens of course
thereafter, as you'll remember,

00:26:19.922 --> 00:26:23.089
is that Lily pops up from the
back seat: "Hi."

00:26:23.089 --> 00:26:25.630
He didn't know that she was
there.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:30.109
And she's got a handful of
dandelions, and she's painted

00:26:30.109 --> 00:26:35.160
her mouth red with lipstick,
and she's trying to seduce him.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:39.092
And he had, in fact,
given her this little sort of

00:26:39.092 --> 00:26:43.104
seductive note earlier
suggesting that he wanted to

00:26:43.104 --> 00:26:47.175
seduce her, too.
And he still has in his mind

00:26:47.175 --> 00:26:51.666
that he should do this,
and his point is to do it so

00:26:51.666 --> 00:26:57.213
that he will prove that he needs
no redemption and that there is

00:26:57.213 --> 00:27:00.463
no sin.
The problem here is that Lily

00:27:00.463 --> 00:27:05.153
is interested in the seduction
precisely because she sees it as

00:27:05.153 --> 00:27:10.216
a kind of sin.
So, if the two enter into this

00:27:10.216 --> 00:27:16.259
seduction, they do so agreeing
on the same act,

00:27:16.259 --> 00:27:20.891
but completely diametrically
opposed on its theological

00:27:20.891 --> 00:27:24.150
meaning or its metaphysical
meaning.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:28.861
And so, what you'll notice
in this chapter is an extended

00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:33.259
example--in one of the only
extended conversations of the

00:27:33.259 --> 00:27:37.500
book--of that phenomenon I
talked about last time,

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:42.346
where the characters just don't
seem to register the existence

00:27:42.346 --> 00:27:46.773
of the other person at all.
So Haze, as I argued last time,

00:27:46.773 --> 00:27:49.770
is kind of insulated.
Even his senses are insulated.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.064
He can't hear things.
He doesn't see what's in front

00:27:53.064 --> 00:27:55.796
of him.
He doesn't seem to be in his

00:27:55.796 --> 00:27:59.778
context physically at all.
He doesn't seem to register the

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:02.929
pain of other persons.
Sometimes, he doesn't even seem

00:28:02.929 --> 00:28:05.539
to register the existence of
other persons.

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:10.321
Well, this is an example--this
conversation--of completely

00:28:10.321 --> 00:28:13.759
missed signals between the two
of them.

00:28:13.759 --> 00:28:19.484
Sabbath Lily tells the story of
wrestling with her identity as a

00:28:19.484 --> 00:28:24.937
bastard, and on 119 you get her
account of her writing to the

00:28:24.937 --> 00:28:30.117
advice columnist Mary Brittle
about the problem of being a

00:28:30.117 --> 00:28:35.206
bastard and what kind of sexual
play is appropriate for a

00:28:35.206 --> 00:28:38.218
bastard,
given the fact that the Bible

00:28:38.218 --> 00:28:41.119
says a bastard shall not enter
the kingdom of heaven.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:43.627
So she's trying to figure out,
really, whether she should

00:28:43.627 --> 00:28:45.776
sleep with someone,
because what does she have to

00:28:45.776 --> 00:28:47.204
lose?
She can't get in to heaven

00:28:47.204 --> 00:28:49.519
anyway.
So she says: 

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:51.819
"Dear Mary:
I am a bastard and a bastard

00:28:51.819 --> 00:28:54.630
shall not enter the kingdom of
heaven as we all know.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.730
But I have this personality
that makes boys follow me.

00:28:57.730 --> 00:28:59.390
Do you think I should neck or
not?

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:01.852
I shall not enter the kingdom
of heaven anyway so I don't see

00:29:01.852 --> 00:29:02.960
what difference it makes.'"

00:29:03.329 --> 00:29:06.509
And then she writes back,
Mary Brittle:

00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:09.719
"Dear Sabbath:
Light necking is acceptable,

00:29:09.719 --> 00:29:13.463
but I think your real problem
is one of adjustment to the

00:29:13.463 --> 00:29:16.126
modern world.
Perhaps you ought to reexamine

00:29:16.126 --> 00:29:19.279
your religious values to see if
they meet your needs in life.

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:22.022
A religious experience can be a
beautiful addition to living,

00:29:22.022 --> 00:29:24.444
if you put it in the proper
perspective and do not let

00:29:24.444 --> 00:29:27.720
it--[I think this is a misprint.
Do you have "warf" there?

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.437
I think it's "warp," "warp
you."]

00:29:30.437 --> 00:29:34.259
Read some books on ethical
culture." 

00:29:34.259 --> 00:29:40.371
Clearly, O'Connor is offering
us Mary Brittle as the butt of

00:29:40.371 --> 00:29:44.826
her critique,
the shallow modern thinking of

00:29:44.826 --> 00:29:48.244
the
"enlightened"--psychologically

00:29:48.244 --> 00:29:56.534
and ethically--modern person.
Sabbath in this chapter is an

00:29:56.534 --> 00:30:00.890
odd Christ figure.
She is a Christ figure.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:05.303
Remember how she hides and
skips from tree to tree in this

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:09.640
scene, when she's teasing Haze,
towards the end of it.

00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:16.620
Well, that tree is also the
image of the cross that is part

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:22.230
of Christian tradition.
There are lots of hymns that

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:27.616
talk about the tree as the
cross, or the cross as the tree,

00:30:27.616 --> 00:30:30.355
for example.
But it's the figure,

00:30:30.355 --> 00:30:34.390
the ragged figure that moves
from tree to tree in the back of

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:38.559
Haze's mind, that's the Christ
that won't let him get away.

00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:43.329
So Lily actually embodies that
Christ-like figure.

00:30:43.329 --> 00:30:49.866
So, for all her impurity,
O'Connor presents her in

00:30:49.866 --> 00:30:56.033
contrast to Mary Brittle as
understanding something

00:30:56.033 --> 00:31:02.923
fundamental about the world,
and what's important in the

00:31:02.923 --> 00:31:09.029
world that much more plausible
people don't understand.

00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:15.831
So, this is a moment when
Sabbath tempts Haze back to

00:31:15.831 --> 00:31:20.410
belief, and Haze's meditation
on,

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:24.003
or his wrestling with,
the question in this chapter of

00:31:24.003 --> 00:31:27.799
whether a bastard can be in the
Church without Christ.

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:30.069
And he comes to that point
where he says,

00:31:30.069 --> 00:31:32.822
"No.
A bastard can't be part of the

00:31:32.822 --> 00:31:37.487
Church without Christ because
the word 'bastard' would just

00:31:37.487 --> 00:31:41.670
simply not mean anything,
so you can't say that."

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.812
And it takes him a long time to
wrestle with this,

00:31:44.812 --> 00:31:48.660
as Sabbath Lily talks to him,
and he comes to this moment.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:55.310
And so, when he comes to that
conclusion, he also rejects her

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:58.497
advances.
It's coming to that conclusion

00:31:58.497 --> 00:32:02.039
that so preoccupies him that he
rejects her advances.

00:32:02.039 --> 00:32:06.599
Sabbath, if she had been able
to seduce him--I want to

00:32:06.599 --> 00:32:09.587
suggest;
O'Connor, I think,

00:32:09.587 --> 00:32:16.325
is suggesting--would have drawn
him back into the realm of

00:32:16.325 --> 00:32:22.826
belief.What leads Haze on
through this scene is that

00:32:22.826 --> 00:32:27.860
blinding white cloud.
Here it is as they decide

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:32.643
whether to turn off the road and
enter the field where Sabbath

00:32:32.643 --> 00:32:35.779
will try to complete this
seduction:

00:32:35.779 --> 00:32:38.440
The blinding white cloud
was a little ahead of them,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.195
moving to the left.
"Why don't you turn down that

00:32:41.195 --> 00:32:43.099
dirt road?"
she asked.

00:32:43.099 --> 00:32:45.985
The highway forked off on to a
clay road and he turned on to

00:32:45.985 --> 00:32:47.896
it.
It was hilly and shady and the

00:32:47.896 --> 00:32:50.340
country showed to advantage on
either side.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:53.780
One side was dense honeysuckle.
The other was open and slanted

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.940
down to a telescoped view of the
city.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.740
The white cloud was directly in
front of them.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.579
So, here the city is at a
distance.

00:33:01.579 --> 00:33:04.598
We're in a pastoral space,
a beautiful space,

00:33:04.598 --> 00:33:08.371
and this is all sort of under
the guidance of this white

00:33:08.371 --> 00:33:10.910
cloud, this blinding white
cloud.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.869
And of course,
I don't have to say to you,

00:33:13.869 --> 00:33:16.829
I'm sure, "Blinding
white cloud?

00:33:16.829 --> 00:33:18.549
Why is this the blinding white
cloud?"

00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:22.119
Well, this is all about
blinding, this book.

00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:27.136
It's about Asa's failed
blinding of himself for Christ,

00:33:27.136 --> 00:33:29.829
and it's about,
in the end,

00:33:29.829 --> 00:33:35.478
finally, Haze's successful
blinding: a kind of blinding

00:33:35.478 --> 00:33:40.372
that, I would argue,
we're meant to understand as a

00:33:40.372 --> 00:33:44.693
final clarity of vision,
that to be blind is to see

00:33:44.693 --> 00:33:47.273
properly.
So, the blinding white

00:33:47.273 --> 00:33:50.537
cloud has this clichéd
God imagery--the curls and

00:33:50.537 --> 00:33:55.824
beard--in the beginning.
It takes on this leading aspect

00:33:55.824 --> 00:34:02.598
in the middle of the chapter,
and then, if you look at the

00:34:02.598 --> 00:34:05.393
end,
this is at the very end of the

00:34:05.393 --> 00:34:09.825
chapter, a few pages on.
This is after the man from the

00:34:09.825 --> 00:34:15.603
filling station has given Haze
some gas and not charged him for

00:34:15.603 --> 00:34:20.449
it, a very unusual act of
kindness in this novel.

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:25.846
Haze drove on,
leaving the man who has helped

00:34:25.846 --> 00:34:32.836
him: "The blinding white cloud
had turned into a bird with

00:34:32.836 --> 00:34:36.766
long,
thin wings and was disappearing

00:34:36.766 --> 00:34:41.815
in the opposite direction."
There's a perfect circularity

00:34:41.815 --> 00:34:44.849
to this symbolism.
It's at the beginning;

00:34:44.849 --> 00:34:47.869
it changes in the middle,
and arrives at the end.

00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:53.549
By the end it has changed from
the clichéd image of the

00:34:53.549 --> 00:34:58.576
Christian God to a less
farcically clichéd image

00:34:58.576 --> 00:35:02.580
of the Holy Spirit:
the bird ascending,

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:08.345
the white bird.
It's moving in the opposite

00:35:08.345 --> 00:35:12.838
direction, suggesting that Haze
in this scene has missed his

00:35:12.838 --> 00:35:15.734
chance.
It was presiding over Sabbath

00:35:15.734 --> 00:35:19.781
Lily's attempts to seduce,
and he was so absorbed in the

00:35:19.781 --> 00:35:24.123
question of whether a bastard
could be in the Church without

00:35:24.123 --> 00:35:28.760
Christ that he doesn't follow
her into the sin that would,

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.170
in fact, be the catalyst for
his redemption.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.599
And so, the cloud departs at
the end.

00:35:36.599 --> 00:35:42.068
I have to say:
this is incredibly heavy

00:35:42.068 --> 00:35:45.767
handed.
If we think about the religious

00:35:45.767 --> 00:35:49.355
reading, and think about
religious symbolism,

00:35:49.355 --> 00:35:56.194
this is hardly innovative.
And I would suggest to you that

00:35:56.194 --> 00:36:01.389
O'Connorâ€¦well,
I don't know.

00:36:01.389 --> 00:36:03.180
Did O'Connor know that it was
heavy handed?

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.654
It don't know.
What is true about O'Connor is

00:36:07.654 --> 00:36:11.940
that she was trained to write
stories like this.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.644
Flannery O'Connor--and this is,
again, that context coming

00:36:15.644 --> 00:36:19.155
in--Flannery O'Connor was a
student at the Iowa Writers

00:36:19.155 --> 00:36:22.421
Workshop,
a very prestigious writing

00:36:22.421 --> 00:36:24.953
program.
Even then, it was a very

00:36:24.953 --> 00:36:28.681
prestigious writing program.
There is a peculiarity for

00:36:28.681 --> 00:36:31.981
writing in the second half of
the twentieth century,

00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:35.410
and here I'm drawing on another
critic, from UCLA;

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:40.123
his name is Mark McGurl.
He has argued that what is

00:36:40.123 --> 00:36:46.031
historically novel about this
period is that writers have

00:36:46.031 --> 00:36:50.780
consistently been located in
universities.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:54.360
They have been trained at
universities;

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.969
they have taught at
universities;

00:36:56.969 --> 00:37:00.600
they have gone to creative
writing programs embedded within

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.724
universities;
they have held visiting

00:37:03.724 --> 00:37:07.130
positions;
they've done readings;

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:12.834
and they have written books
whose primary readership is

00:37:12.834 --> 00:37:18.750
around a seminar table or in a
lecture hall like this.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:26.010
His argument is that a kind
of formal structure,

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:31.989
characterized by the principle
of unity,

00:37:31.989 --> 00:37:36.902
a formal structure that was (in
that simplified version) at the

00:37:36.902 --> 00:37:41.736
very heart of the most powerful
critical movement of the early

00:37:41.736 --> 00:37:45.380
twentieth century,
and that is the New Criticism.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:51.892
The New Criticism is a way of
reading that has its roots in

00:37:51.892 --> 00:37:55.934
high modernism,
and it emphasizes the

00:37:55.934 --> 00:38:01.323
writer's--usually the
poet's--ability to create a

00:38:01.323 --> 00:38:05.535
beautiful,
whole, consistent,

00:38:05.535 --> 00:38:13.452
internally structured literary
object that stands outside of

00:38:13.452 --> 00:38:21.880
history in a certain way,
that is autonomous.

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:25.932
And so, this view of the
artwork--probably you have

00:38:25.932 --> 00:38:30.389
experienced it if you've taken
other English classes,

00:38:30.389 --> 00:38:35.739
and in fact I've been producing
it for you in my readings--this

00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:40.829
mode of reading looks for those
tropes that unify a work.

00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:45.105
It looks for that circularity
that I've described in this

00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:47.930
little chapter,
tracks the symbols.

00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:52.449
There's more to it than that.
It also looks for ambiguity.

00:38:52.449 --> 00:38:55.917
O'Connor says about her symbols
that they should "keep on

00:38:55.917 --> 00:38:59.385
deepening," that they should
never be reduced to a simple

00:38:59.385 --> 00:39:02.520
equation,
X equals Y, cloud equals God,

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.780
that they should have a sense
of mystery about them.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.792
Well, this was part and parcel
of what a New Critical reading

00:39:09.792 --> 00:39:12.253
practice would look like,
and it's still extremely

00:39:12.253 --> 00:39:16.230
powerful in our classrooms.
We do a lot of close readings.

00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:20.473
Now, we put our close readings
to different kinds of uses,

00:39:20.473 --> 00:39:24.419
and Mark McGurl has done
readings of lots of different

00:39:24.419 --> 00:39:28.216
novelists that reveal (or,
his argument is that they

00:39:28.216 --> 00:39:32.460
reveal) how the writing program
and its tenets have shaped

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.960
contemporary fiction in a
profound way.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.939
The implications of this are
large and important for how we

00:39:40.939 --> 00:39:46.355
understand the period.
So what you see in O'Connor

00:39:46.355 --> 00:39:52.524
is, to borrow a phrase from
McGurl's title of his essay on

00:39:52.524 --> 00:39:55.737
this,
"Flannery O'Connor,

00:39:55.737 --> 00:40:02.037
B.A., M.F.A.," the product of a
mid-century American

00:40:02.037 --> 00:40:05.909
institution,
the writing program.

00:40:05.909 --> 00:40:12.642
I would suggest -- and this is
the third kind of context I want

00:40:12.642 --> 00:40:19.266
to give you today -- that the
three I've given you--O'Connor's

00:40:19.266 --> 00:40:22.743
letters,
her theological commitments,

00:40:22.743 --> 00:40:25.925
southern context,
southern social context,

00:40:25.925 --> 00:40:28.719
the New Critical writing
program,

00:40:28.719 --> 00:40:33.360
the institutionalization of
modernism--these things are not

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.320
in fact separable from one
another.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.375
Because in my own work,
I'm writing a book on religion

00:40:41.375 --> 00:40:44.993
and fiction since 1960;
now, this is a little bit

00:40:44.993 --> 00:40:47.008
before this period.
But what I have

00:40:47.008 --> 00:40:50.709
discovered--what has really been
known for a long time,

00:40:50.709 --> 00:40:54.891
but nobody's really made much
of it--is that the New Criticism

00:40:54.891 --> 00:40:57.769
is deeply religious in and of
itself.

00:40:57.769 --> 00:41:02.446
New Critical writers of theory:
many of them were,

00:41:02.446 --> 00:41:07.409
in fact, Catholic,
and many of them were southern.

00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:12.773
There are social and religious
elements that infuse their

00:41:12.773 --> 00:41:17.179
literary theory,
so that to argue that the poem

00:41:17.179 --> 00:41:22.344
is this unified whole,
and that what you should do

00:41:22.344 --> 00:41:27.890
with the poem is show its
wholeness-- read it in order to

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:32.651
see its wholeness,
see how it embodies a formal

00:41:32.651 --> 00:41:38.397
beauty, a formal order--this
looks very much like the kind of

00:41:38.397 --> 00:41:43.760
metaphysical order that I was
drawing out of the Catholic

00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:48.739
version of what O'Connor's doing
in her novels,

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:51.027
her version of what she's doing
in the novels,

00:41:51.027 --> 00:41:53.010
where you have that
transcendent sky,

00:41:53.010 --> 00:41:55.827
and there is this sense of an
ordering that seeps down in to

00:41:55.827 --> 00:41:59.367
the material world,
that moment when Haze thinks

00:41:59.367 --> 00:42:04.261
that he's somehow seeing
broken-off pieces of something

00:42:04.261 --> 00:42:08.518
that once happened to him.
There is this latent order

00:42:08.518 --> 00:42:11.065
everywhere.
And, for O'Connor,

00:42:11.065 --> 00:42:14.954
it's part of this moral
religious order,

00:42:14.954 --> 00:42:20.340
this redemptive order,
that Catholicism is for her.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:26.605
The New Criticism sits in a
kind of deep analogy to that way

00:42:26.605 --> 00:42:31.384
of thinking about religion.
That's why, I think,

00:42:31.384 --> 00:42:35.553
O'Connor found it so
comfortable to learn and

00:42:35.553 --> 00:42:41.333
practice the New Critical tenets
of formal construction of the

00:42:41.333 --> 00:42:44.950
literary.
That's why she produced story

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:49.688
after story after story that can
be read in these formal ways

00:42:49.688 --> 00:42:54.348
with these symbols that accrue
meaning and deepen and change

00:42:54.348 --> 00:42:58.059
over the course of the novel or
the story.

00:42:58.059 --> 00:43:03.323
So her commitment to the New
Criticism: McGurl argues that

00:43:03.323 --> 00:43:09.140
O'Connor found the New Criticism
comfortable because Catholicism

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:14.358
had taught her to be obedient,
that it was a matter of

00:43:14.358 --> 00:43:19.600
obedience to a formula that
allowed her to produce what she

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:24.006
produced on the page.
I would argue it differently:

00:43:24.006 --> 00:43:28.017
that there is something,
in fact, religious about the

00:43:28.017 --> 00:43:32.181
New Criticism that made it
particularly comfortable for

00:43:32.181 --> 00:43:34.110
O'Connor to inhabit.

00:43:38.639 --> 00:43:44.260
Now, I want to conclude by
pointing you towards Lolita.

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:49.389
Today the question of
torturing your own characters

00:43:49.389 --> 00:43:51.920
has come up.
Yaeger calls it,

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.969
with respect to O'Connor,
an "aesthetics of torture."

00:43:55.969 --> 00:44:01.153
I want you to think hard about
whether this is a way of

00:44:01.153 --> 00:44:05.570
understanding Lolita when
we read it.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:10.008
So, have that in your mind,
and think about the ways that

00:44:10.008 --> 00:44:14.210
violence is or is not presented
to us in Lolita,

00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:19.363
the way that we're asked
either to attend to language or

00:44:19.363 --> 00:44:22.838
to see through it.
Ask those questions about

00:44:22.838 --> 00:44:26.988
whether we're being asked to
identify with certain characters

00:44:26.988 --> 00:44:29.879
or not.
How is the distance between

00:44:29.879 --> 00:44:33.870
reader and character,
between reader and what's on

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:37.910
the page, how is that mediated?
How is that policed?

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:42.209
How is that structured?
So, think about that as you

00:44:42.209 --> 00:44:46.000
start to read Lolita.
I'm going to stop there.

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.234
Prof: Okay,
I have a lot to talk about

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:11.870
today, and we move one century,
and we move into another

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.610
culture.
 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.570
Both are very important.
 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.489
We move from seventeenth
century England to eighteenth

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.030
century France.
 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.020
We move from a situation which
was dominated by civil war,

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.360
chaos and a yearning for a
clear sovereign,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.351
and we move in a century,
you can call it of

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:46.085
Enlightenment--
that's where the term

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:50.802
Enlightenment comes from,
the French context--and a

00:00:50.802 --> 00:00:53.410
century of decadence.
 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.833
Eventually it leads to a
revolution, but before the

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:02.609
revolution there is a lot of
fairly juicy decadence.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.450
So two different epochs and two
different cultures.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.793
British individualism:
Hobbes and Locke were

00:01:12.793 --> 00:01:16.769
methodological individualists.
 

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:21.876
They thought the analysis
should start always with the

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:23.129
individual.
 

00:01:23.129 --> 00:01:27.973
You remember Hobbes--individual
drives and fears--and then he

00:01:27.973 --> 00:01:31.929
builds up that society is
starting always from the

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.140
individual.
 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.010
Not the French.
 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.459
The French are methodological
collectivists.

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:44.282
They believe there is such a
thing as society which is more

00:01:44.282 --> 00:01:48.771
than the sum total of the
individuals, and somehow they

00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:50.849
know how to grasp it.
 

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:57.410
So these are the changes,
what you will see today,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.105
Thursday and next Tuesday,
when we will be discussing

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:05.810
Montesquieu and Jean Jacques
Rousseau,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.780
before we return to British
individualism,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.430
Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill.
 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.183
Don't ask me why this
difference between the two

00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:21.860
cultures, but there is a lasting
difference.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.429
Today's topic is Montesquieu,
and I have a lot of fun stories

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:31.222
to tell,
but I'll try to limit my

00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:38.268
anecdotes so I can focus enough
on the text and do not run out

00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:40.810
of time by the end.
 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.080
Okay, so that was Montesquieu.
 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:51.449
He was born as Charles-Louis de
Secondat, Baron de La

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:58.110
Brède--was born in 1689
near Bordeaux.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.032
His father was from a noble
family, but because he was a

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:07.062
younger son he had to become a
mercenary, and,

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:11.180
in fact, he was fighting Turks
in Hungary.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.752
He received a law degree
nevertheless,

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:19.581
from the University of
Bordeaux, and in 1715 he did

00:03:19.581 --> 00:03:24.903
what many aristocrats did;
he married a wealthy woman,

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:28.854
Jeanne de Lartigue,
which was helpful for him

00:03:28.854 --> 00:03:33.882
because he was not all that very
wealthy, though he was a

00:03:33.882 --> 00:03:35.139
nobleman.
 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:39.538
His uncle was Baron de
Montesquieu,

00:03:39.538 --> 00:03:44.675
and when he passed away
Charles-Louis received his

00:03:44.675 --> 00:03:47.486
title,
he became Montesquieu,

00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:51.226
and inherited his office,
the presidency of the

00:03:51.226 --> 00:03:52.878
Parliament of Bordeaux.
 

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:56.238
Don't think about it,
it was not a very big deal and

00:03:56.238 --> 00:03:59.860
certainly did not offer income
for a luxurious life--

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.006
was not particularly affluent
stuff and was not particularly

00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:06.490
powerful stuff.
 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.840
Now a bit about the times.
 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.348
Well here it is,
Louis XIV, the heights of

00:04:13.348 --> 00:04:15.550
French absolutism.
 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.480
Well he was called the Sun King.
 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.189
And here is his emblem, the sun;
he's shining like the sun.

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:33.565
Well he actually
claimed--that's a famous

00:04:33.565 --> 00:04:37.228
sentence,
and important to understand

00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:40.505
Montesquieu--
"L'état c'est

00:04:40.505 --> 00:04:42.959
moi,"
I am the state.

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:47.060
Well it was kind of an
over-statement--not quite.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.120
He pretended to be more
powerful than he actually was.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.654
The French absolutism did show
already cracks,

00:04:55.654 --> 00:05:01.095
and the bourgeoisie was
becoming already quite powerful

00:05:01.095 --> 00:05:04.420
under the times of Louis XIV.
 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.182
But he had the notion of French
gloire,

00:05:09.182 --> 00:05:15.427
the glory, and he built this
wonderful Palace of Versailles,

00:05:15.427 --> 00:05:19.980
showing what gloire or
glory is.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:25.814
President de Gaulle also
emphasized the French

00:05:25.814 --> 00:05:27.889
gloire.
 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.509
The French are very fond of it.
 

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.377
Okay, the eighteenth century
was the Century of

00:05:34.377 --> 00:05:37.742
Enlightenment,
called de Siècle of

00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:42.831
Lumière;
lumière means the

00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:43.620
light.
 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:51.762
Well it was Descartes who
transformed philosophy towards

00:05:51.762 --> 00:05:57.538
the cold view,
cold look of reason--and that

00:05:57.538 --> 00:06:04.730
was the one which was spreading
in eighteenth century England--

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:09.180
culminating in the 1789
revolution.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.139
And we see two major steps in
this direction:

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.569
Montesquieu and Rousseau.
 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.500
Well one of the major
accomplishment of the

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.843
Enlightenment were the
publications of

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:31.375
Encyclopédie--
the sort of predecessor of

00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:37.430
Encyclopedia Britannica--
Diderot and d'Alembert edited,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.648
and which put together
rationalistic scholarship of

00:06:41.648 --> 00:06:42.829
their time.
 

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:47.310
Well here you have the First
Edition of

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.730
Encyclopédie.
 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:56.843
Well as Louis XIV passed away,
his five-year-old

00:06:56.843 --> 00:07:02.567
great-grandson,
Louis XV, became the king and

00:07:02.567 --> 00:07:06.600
ruled for a very long time.
 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:13.278
Well the decade of absolutism
and royal authority continued,

00:07:13.278 --> 00:07:20.250
and we are really entering now,
with 1715,

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.689
one--probably the longest in
modern history--

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:30.379
the longest epoch of decadence
and sexual permissiveness.

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:34.163
It's an interesting kind
of--seemed to recur in human

00:07:34.163 --> 00:07:35.399
history, right?
 

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:41.281
Then you had a similar kind of
permissiveness and sort of

00:07:41.281 --> 00:07:46.009
decadence--1890s until 1914;
probably 1930.

00:07:46.009 --> 00:07:49.644
And then the 1960s,
of course, when everything

00:07:49.644 --> 00:07:50.209
goes.
 

00:07:50.209 --> 00:07:54.680
Well this was a time of this
kind.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.817
Well he was not particularly
interested in governing,

00:07:59.817 --> 00:08:04.560
but he was very interested in
beautiful women.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:07.824
Well he was quite a good
looking guy when he was young,

00:08:07.824 --> 00:08:08.430
as well.
 

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.240
So I'm sure women were quite
interested in him too.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.365
And you know the name;
Madame Pompadour was the most

00:08:17.365 --> 00:08:23.290
famous and most influential of
his mistresses.

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:28.791
As I said, it was becoming a
time of sexual permissiveness,

00:08:28.791 --> 00:08:32.871
promiscuity pretty
widespread--also affected

00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:34.389
Montesquieu.
 

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:41.220
Here is Madame Pompadour,
indeed a very beautiful person.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.433
But not only beautiful;
she was extremely smart as

00:08:45.433 --> 00:08:47.470
well, as far as we can tell.
 

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.570
She was an intellectual of very
distinguished taste.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:54.408
She knew all people of the
Enlightenment;

00:08:54.408 --> 00:08:58.470
Voltaire, one of the big
troublemakers of his time.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.865
She supported Diderot and the
project of

00:09:01.865 --> 00:09:06.914
Encyclopédie,
which was unusual because royal

00:09:06.914 --> 00:09:10.658
authority did not really like
this one.

00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:15.236
Well let me just give you a
little ethnography,

00:09:15.236 --> 00:09:18.918
if you are interested:
Des Liaisons

00:09:18.918 --> 00:09:20.908
Dangereuses.
 

00:09:20.908 --> 00:09:27.212
Pierre Chordelos de Laclos
wrote a novel about the sexual

00:09:27.212 --> 00:09:30.856
mores of this time,
which is called The

00:09:30.856 --> 00:09:34.860
Dangerous Relationships,
Les Liaisons Dangereuses.

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:38.168
Well there was two movies made
of it.

00:09:38.168 --> 00:09:41.470
And anybody watched any of
these movies?

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.899
Nobody watched it.
 

00:09:42.899 --> 00:09:44.250
Wonderful movie.
 

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:48.246
Well there are two versions:
one by Roger Vadim,

00:09:48.246 --> 00:09:53.519
and that puts the whole story
in French society of its time.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:56.789
And the other one is an
American one:

00:09:56.789 --> 00:10:00.423
Stephen Frears,
and it is Glenn Close who

00:10:00.423 --> 00:10:02.149
features in it.
 

00:10:02.149 --> 00:10:05.460
Well this is the Pierre Vadim
movie.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.418
You can borrow it;
do, you will have fun,

00:10:08.418 --> 00:10:11.230
and you will have an
understanding what

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:14.340
mid-eighteenth century in France
was,

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.538
and where Montesquieu and
Rousseau are coming from.

00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:21.299
And, of course,
this is the American version

00:10:21.299 --> 00:10:22.519
with Glenn Close.
 

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:29.078
She is already "rah",
the person what she likes to

00:10:29.078 --> 00:10:31.970
play: the vicious woman.
 

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.450
Okay.
 

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:38.263
Now Montesquieu,
well he lives in the century of

00:10:38.263 --> 00:10:41.950
Enlightenment and
promiscuousness.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:46.350
He sells his office;
though I mean he lives from the

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.700
wealth of his wife.
 

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.955
Starts a wine business,
but then he leaves the wine

00:10:50.955 --> 00:10:54.731
business to the wife and he's
beginning to travel in Europe

00:10:54.731 --> 00:10:55.970
and in England.
 

00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.816
Then when he returns,
he settles in Paris,

00:10:59.816 --> 00:11:04.037
leaves the wife back to run the
wine business,

00:11:04.037 --> 00:11:07.038
and he's beginning to write.
 

00:11:07.038 --> 00:11:11.032
He writes, publishes in 1721
already the Persian

00:11:11.032 --> 00:11:14.484
Letters--
I talked about this before--and

00:11:14.484 --> 00:11:18.702
then he was elected on the basis
of this to Académie

00:11:18.702 --> 00:11:23.080
Française,
the French Academy of Sciences

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.097
and Art--
a very big accomplishment at

00:11:26.097 --> 00:11:27.649
this very early age.
 

00:11:27.649 --> 00:11:31.735
And finally,
1748, he publishes the major

00:11:31.735 --> 00:11:32.450
book.
 

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:35.918
This is really a very important
book.

00:11:35.918 --> 00:11:39.590
I hope you did what I asked,
you glanced at it.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.966
Not an easy read--a bit drier
than some of the texts we read,

00:11:43.966 --> 00:11:47.759
but very important,
fundamentally important stuff.

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:50.462
Diderot asks him to write
something for the

00:11:50.462 --> 00:11:53.360
Encyclopédie about
democracy.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:57.673
But he's bored with the
question of democracy--he wrote

00:11:57.673 --> 00:12:01.990
enough about this--so he writes
an article on taste.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:06.590
Okay, and he died in 1755 in
Paris.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:16.004
So these are the times,
and this is your author,

00:12:16.004 --> 00:12:18.809
Montesquieu.
 

00:12:18.809 --> 00:12:21.590
Now let me move on to the work.
 

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:45.879
 
 

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:52.529
Yes, so here we go:
The Spirit of the Laws.

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:56.750
And here is the First Edition.
 

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.769
So what is this book?
 

00:12:59.769 --> 00:13:05.485
The first part is law in
general and different modes of

00:13:05.485 --> 00:13:10.250
governance--interesting,
not path-breaking.

00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:13.135
This is not what he will be
remembered for,

00:13:13.135 --> 00:13:15.748
though, I mean,
he is opening some very

00:13:15.748 --> 00:13:17.808
important subject matters.
 

00:13:17.808 --> 00:13:21.364
The second one is law and
politics, and separation of

00:13:21.364 --> 00:13:21.980
powers.
 

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:26.876
We will see he builds on Locke
and takes Locke in a big way

00:13:26.876 --> 00:13:31.859
forward--a great improvement in
many--to the extent there is

00:13:31.859 --> 00:13:33.210
improvement.
 

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.246
Of course, Locke has some
insight which is missing from

00:13:37.246 --> 00:13:41.509
the Montesquieuian formulation
of separation of powers.

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:47.200
Then he has this extraordinary
section on law and climate.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.389
This is one of his big
contributions.

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:55.903
I will show you the way how he
formulated it is extremely

00:13:55.903 --> 00:14:00.528
naïve, almost borders on
the ridiculous.

00:14:00.528 --> 00:14:05.240
But, given the twenty-first
century,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.192
there are very few people,
with the exception of Ibn

00:14:08.192 --> 00:14:11.119
Khaldun--
whom I named already in the

00:14:11.119 --> 00:14:16.028
introductory lecture--
who was so sensitive that

00:14:16.028 --> 00:14:21.905
society lives in this globe,
and how society is formed and

00:14:21.905 --> 00:14:25.500
structured,
and how its laws are being

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.698
shaped is actually greatly
influenced by the nature of

00:14:30.698 --> 00:14:34.820
environmental and climactic
conditions.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:40.673
So he is the first ecologist he
is the first environmentalist

00:14:40.673 --> 00:14:46.820
who understand the interaction
between social organizations--

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.590
mores, ethics,
ideas--and society.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:57.678
And then there is a bit on law
and commerce.

00:14:57.678 --> 00:15:00.652
I will very briefly talk about
this, law and religion,

00:15:00.652 --> 00:15:03.120
and I will skip this section
all together;

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:05.740
and law and history I'll also
skip.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:07.620
So what are the main themes?
 

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:10.517
First, you know,
will be about classification of

00:15:10.517 --> 00:15:11.379
governments.
 

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:15.086
Then I will talk about
separation of powers,

00:15:15.086 --> 00:15:17.070
and then environment.
 

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:22.385
Law and social structure,
right--these are the issues we

00:15:22.385 --> 00:15:24.899
will be rushing through.
 

00:15:24.899 --> 00:15:29.870
There's a lot of stuff to look
at.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:34.595
Well before Montesquieu,
the question when they

00:15:34.595 --> 00:15:40.759
classified government was who
rules, who is the sovereign?

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:44.029
Montesquieu changes somewhat
the discourse.

00:15:44.029 --> 00:15:48.866
He is interested in the manner
of governments,

00:15:48.866 --> 00:15:53.058
how people who are in authority
rule;

00:15:53.058 --> 00:15:57.581
the real basic distinction,
whether a government is

00:15:57.581 --> 00:16:00.928
moderate or whether it is
despotic.

00:16:00.928 --> 00:16:08.014
Well, what are the questions
when you try to judge the nature

00:16:08.014 --> 00:16:10.139
of a government?
 

00:16:10.139 --> 00:16:13.309
One important question he said
you should ask:

00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:16.269
Are the various powers
separated or not?

00:16:16.269 --> 00:16:20.370
Irrespective who rules--whether
it can be a king,

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.940
it can be an elected president,
it can be a prime minister--

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:28.769
the question is:
Are the powers separated?

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:34.745
And the next question is--this
is very important--why do people

00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:35.418
obey?
 

00:16:35.418 --> 00:16:40.595
The question why people obey
orders is touched upon by Hobbes

00:16:40.595 --> 00:16:44.389
and Locke, but it's not really
elaborated.

00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:48.548
This is the issue what they
will call the question of

00:16:48.548 --> 00:16:49.428
legitimacy.
 

00:16:49.428 --> 00:16:50.149
Right?
 

00:16:50.149 --> 00:16:54.340
What are the principles of why
they obey orders?

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:59.038
And we will see much later in
this course that it will be Max

00:16:59.038 --> 00:17:03.269
Weber who elaborates on this
issue at great lengths.

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:09.630
And then the next question is
okay, is the ruler an individual

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.548
or is this an institution?
 

00:17:12.548 --> 00:17:16.678
You see, this is all very
interesting enrichment of the

00:17:16.678 --> 00:17:19.890
idea what the nature of
governments are.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:25.190
He himself supports a
constitutional monarchy.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:30.730
He supports a monarchy in which
there is a king or queen,

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:36.368
but a king and queen which
operates on the rule of law;

00:17:36.368 --> 00:17:39.578
that's what constitutional
monarchy is.

00:17:39.578 --> 00:17:42.348
The second major theme is
separation of powers.

00:17:42.348 --> 00:17:44.740
I'm still elaborating what will
come.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:48.493
Well you have read Locke
distinguished between

00:17:48.493 --> 00:17:52.498
legislative, executive and
federative branches of

00:17:52.498 --> 00:17:53.750
government.
 

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:58.914
Montesquieu distinguishes
between legislative,

00:17:58.914 --> 00:18:01.900
executive and juridical.
 

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.849
Well this is the one which has
been so influential on the

00:18:06.849 --> 00:18:11.267
American Constitution--
what we all believe now in this

00:18:11.267 --> 00:18:13.454
country--
that these are the three

00:18:13.454 --> 00:18:15.670
branches which should be
separated;

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:18.709
though, of course,
the federative remains to be an

00:18:18.709 --> 00:18:19.950
interesting issue.
 

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.858
Who should exercise federative
powers, the powers of war?

00:18:24.858 --> 00:18:29.900
Should it, the legislature,
or should it be at the

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.779
executive branch,
as such?

00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:38.653
Well Montesquieu suggests that
the three powers will have to be

00:18:38.653 --> 00:18:39.788
separated.
 

00:18:39.788 --> 00:18:45.330
The legislative power--and this
is a departure from Hobbes and

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.509
Locke--should be by elected
representatives.

00:18:49.509 --> 00:18:54.720
And then he makes an important
new contribution.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.420
He said the right of minorities
should be respected.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:04.605
Though he kind of foreshadows
something like universal voting,

00:19:04.605 --> 00:19:09.618
though he is not quite explicit
about this, but you can read

00:19:09.618 --> 00:19:10.640
into it.
 

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:16.720
But then he said the minority's
rights should be reserved.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.932
And he said,
well the legislative power

00:19:19.932 --> 00:19:23.737
cannot and should not be held by
the monarchs,

00:19:23.737 --> 00:19:28.066
but it has to be limited;
there must be a limitation on

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:29.358
legislative powers.
 

00:19:29.358 --> 00:19:36.838
And the executive will exercise
checks over the legislature--

00:19:36.838 --> 00:19:42.170
and we will again talk about
this in more detail--

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:47.031
but there must be some checks
and balances over the executive

00:19:47.031 --> 00:19:48.410
branch as well.
 

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:51.519
Well it comes,
you know, who controls what?

00:19:51.519 --> 00:19:55.606
He puts more emphasis on the
executive limiting the

00:19:55.606 --> 00:19:58.960
legislatives than the other way
around.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:20:02.046
But we will see what the
arguments are and what the

00:20:02.046 --> 00:20:04.700
rationale for this is,
and how this affects,

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.170
for instance,
the functioning of the U.S.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.588
government today.
 

00:20:08.588 --> 00:20:14.123
I think it is not all that far
away for the blueprint

00:20:14.123 --> 00:20:21.038
Montesquieu established way back
in the mid-eighteenth century.

00:20:21.038 --> 00:20:26.000
And then the last issue will be
environment--how social

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.778
conditions are shaped by
environmental conditions.

00:20:30.778 --> 00:20:33.530
But he said,
but there is also a general

00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:37.058
spirit, a spirit which is above
the individuals.

00:20:37.058 --> 00:20:39.759
And this is a very French
theme, right?

00:20:39.759 --> 00:20:42.559
You cannot explain it from the
individual;

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:44.650
there is some general idea.
 

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:47.680
Durkheim will call it
collective conscience;

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.347
Rousseau will call it the
general will.

00:20:50.347 --> 00:20:50.910
Right?
 

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:55.781
The very French idea that there
is some consciousness above the

00:20:55.781 --> 00:21:01.134
individual consciousnesses--
this has formulated so

00:21:01.134 --> 00:21:06.848
powerfully the first time by
Montesquieu.

00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:09.598
And he actually said as
civilization is progressing,

00:21:09.598 --> 00:21:12.828
the influence of the natural
conditions declines,

00:21:12.828 --> 00:21:16.798
and the importance of general
spirits increases.

00:21:16.798 --> 00:21:19.483
Or to put it with Durkheim,
the collective conscience

00:21:19.483 --> 00:21:21.240
becomes more and more important.
 

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.019
I'll just foreshadow,
that you have a sense that this

00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:25.567
course really hangs together.
 

00:21:25.567 --> 00:21:26.048
Right?
 

00:21:26.048 --> 00:21:28.818
We are not talking about
separate authors;

00:21:28.818 --> 00:21:32.856
we are talking about a set of
authors who are talking to each

00:21:32.856 --> 00:21:34.673
other, debating each other.
 

00:21:34.673 --> 00:21:35.279
Right?
 

00:21:35.279 --> 00:21:38.394
That's, I think,
what is so fascinating about

00:21:38.394 --> 00:21:41.440
the foundations of modern social
thought.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.520
That cannot be said about
twenty or twenty-first century

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.933
social theorizing,
where we are at each other's

00:21:48.933 --> 00:21:51.308
throats and we ignore each
other.

00:21:51.308 --> 00:21:52.200
Right?
 

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.328
That's more typical.
 

00:21:55.328 --> 00:21:59.055
Okay, as I said,
he's a methodological

00:21:59.055 --> 00:22:00.363
collectivist.
 

00:22:00.363 --> 00:22:01.269
Right?
 

00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:03.679
And I just explained this to
you a little,

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:04.150
right?
 

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:08.284
A methodological individualist
who begins--in order to develop

00:22:08.284 --> 00:22:11.673
a conception of society,
you have to start with the

00:22:11.673 --> 00:22:14.000
individual;
the only reality,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.239
what you can observe in
individual action and individual

00:22:18.239 --> 00:22:19.548
consciousness.
 

00:22:19.548 --> 00:22:21.963
Everything else,
what you suggest,

00:22:21.963 --> 00:22:23.060
is speculative.
 

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:23.720
Right?
 

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:27.560
This is British individualism
and empiricism.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.259
Right?
 

00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:32.400
The French emphasizes there are
stuff, like law.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.878
This is why the legal system,
the law, is so important for

00:22:36.878 --> 00:22:37.980
Montesquieu.
 

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.103
That's why the major book is
called The Spirit of

00:22:42.103 --> 00:22:46.509
Law because the law is not
simply a sum total of individual

00:22:46.509 --> 00:22:47.788
consciousness.
 

00:22:47.788 --> 00:22:51.548
It stands over us,
and we get into a society and

00:22:51.548 --> 00:22:55.308
the law, the legal system
already does exist.

00:22:55.308 --> 00:22:57.358
We will see Durkheim does the
same thing;

00:22:57.358 --> 00:23:00.318
this is why the legal system is
so important for him.

00:23:00.318 --> 00:23:06.426
Okay, now let's move into the
first theme and talk about the

00:23:06.426 --> 00:23:09.740
different forms of government.
 

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:17.058
Well he makes a distinction
between republican government,

00:23:17.058 --> 00:23:21.038
monarchy, and despotic state.
 

00:23:21.038 --> 00:23:25.240
Republican government,
in his definition,

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.863
means that either the people
rule--democracy,

00:23:29.863 --> 00:23:32.173
or a subset of people.
 

00:23:32.173 --> 00:23:33.328
Right?
 

00:23:33.328 --> 00:23:40.578
Aristocracy has the sovereign
power--are the source of law.

00:23:40.578 --> 00:23:43.346
As we will see,
he is not all that certain

00:23:43.346 --> 00:23:46.045
whether the people rule is all
that good.

00:23:46.045 --> 00:23:46.720
Right?
 

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:50.509
He prefers sort of selected
aristocracy.

00:23:50.509 --> 00:23:52.500
It will be even true for
Rousseau;

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.730
he's much more radical than he
is.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:24:00.487
Monarchy, in which one alone
governs, but by fundamental

00:24:00.487 --> 00:24:01.220
laws.
 

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.348
The monarchy itself is bound by
laws.

00:24:04.348 --> 00:24:09.467
A despotic state,
there are no fundamental rules.

00:24:09.467 --> 00:24:10.318
Right?
 

00:24:10.318 --> 00:24:14.868
A despot exercises its power at
its will.

00:24:14.868 --> 00:24:19.945
Adolph Hitler's Germany,
or Stalin's Russia or Soviet

00:24:19.945 --> 00:24:26.390
Union, are despotic states where
there is no proper rule of law.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:28.980
Now about the republic.
 

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.869
Well, as we said,
there are two forms of it:

00:24:31.869 --> 00:24:35.029
the democratic and then the
aristocratic one.

00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:39.019
In the democratic,
you have a selection of people

00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:40.598
to office by lot.
 

00:24:40.598 --> 00:24:43.558
Well he's not talking about
elections, but by lot.

00:24:43.558 --> 00:24:47.239
And indeed, in Greek
democracies, people were

00:24:47.239 --> 00:24:52.089
occasionally selected to major
offices in Ancient Greece by

00:24:52.089 --> 00:24:53.930
lot, by a lottery.
 

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:56.858
In aristocracy,
people are selected by choice.

00:24:56.858 --> 00:24:57.380
Right?
 

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.092
The best people get into the
office where they have the best

00:25:02.092 --> 00:25:03.690
skills to perform.
 

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.108
Well he said,
well everyone can vote,

00:25:06.108 --> 00:25:09.740
but not everybody's prepared to
serve in the office.

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:16.598
That speaks for aristocracy by
choice.

00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:21.240
But whatever the republic is,
there is a principle:

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:24.210
legitimacy is based on virtue.
 

00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:26.683
The person who serves should be
virtuous.

00:25:26.683 --> 00:25:27.180
Right?
 

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:32.011
And if the virtuousness of the
person is questioned then,

00:25:32.011 --> 00:25:37.190
you know, the legitimacy of the
person is in some trouble;

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.779
verbally, the virtuousness.
 

00:25:39.779 --> 00:25:42.348
Remember Bill Clinton?
 

00:25:42.348 --> 00:25:45.881
He ran into some trouble,
you know, because people

00:25:45.881 --> 00:25:49.773
started to question his
virtuousness in the very narrow

00:25:49.773 --> 00:25:51.358
sense of the term.
 

00:25:51.358 --> 00:25:54.660
Okay, anyway that's the guiding
principle.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.328
Then monarchy.
 

00:25:56.328 --> 00:26:00.784
Well here the prince has a
sovereign power--is the source

00:26:00.784 --> 00:26:01.500
of law.
 

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.155
But once the law is
established, the prince has to

00:26:05.155 --> 00:26:06.500
follow that law.
 

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:07.750
That's monarchy.
 

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.150
And the principle here is honor.
 

00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:16.180
The prince has to be honorable,
in order to be obeyed.

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:19.740
Again, the basis of legitimacy
is honor.

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.377
And despotism,
as we have seen,

00:26:22.377 --> 00:26:26.777
the one who governs can do
whatever it wants to do,

00:26:26.777 --> 00:26:28.271
is above the law.
 

00:26:28.271 --> 00:26:29.240
Right?
 

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.869
And what is the principle of
despotic rule?

00:26:34.869 --> 00:26:36.400
Fear, right?
 

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.160
You obey those in power because
you fear them.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.829
Well the next theme is
separation of power.

00:26:46.829 --> 00:26:50.920
And we see the three powers.
 

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.470
Well there are the legislative
power,

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:57.700
executive power,
and we will see,

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.211
the power to judge later on--
executive power over things,

00:27:03.211 --> 00:27:06.190
depending on the right of
nations;

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:10.828
executive power over things,
depending on civil rights.

00:27:10.828 --> 00:27:18.748
He said the first power,
legislative power,

00:27:18.748 --> 00:27:28.930
in fact, can be exercised by a
king or a magistrate;

00:27:28.930 --> 00:27:32.798
it can be exercised by even an
elected body.

00:27:32.798 --> 00:27:37.095
But the second one,
executive power,

00:27:37.095 --> 00:27:41.881
well it has to be executed,
he believed,

00:27:41.881 --> 00:27:44.950
usually by a monarch.
 

00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:49.873
And there is the last power,
the power of judging,

00:27:49.873 --> 00:27:55.299
which has to be separated from
both the legislative and

00:27:55.299 --> 00:27:57.308
executive power.
 

00:27:57.308 --> 00:27:59.868
Let's see the argument,
what he puts forward.

00:27:59.868 --> 00:28:03.429
He said when the legislative
power is united with the

00:28:03.429 --> 00:28:06.028
executive power in a single
person,

00:28:06.028 --> 00:28:12.372
there is no liberty because one
can fear that the same monarch

00:28:12.372 --> 00:28:18.506
who makes tyrannical rules will
execute them in a tyrannical

00:28:18.506 --> 00:28:19.650
manner.
 

00:28:19.650 --> 00:28:23.826
So therefore you have to
separate legislative and

00:28:23.826 --> 00:28:25.480
executive powers.
 

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:28.210
Well this separation is not
complete,

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:33.430
because it takes time for the
legislative body to pass laws,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:36.720
and therefore very often
executives,

00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:42.740
even in the United States,
operate with executive orders.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.598
Right?
 

00:28:43.598 --> 00:28:50.752
These executive orders kind of
substitute for laws or legal

00:28:50.752 --> 00:28:52.480
regulations.
 

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.776
So the separation,
even in a modern society like a

00:28:56.776 --> 00:28:59.318
United States,
is relative.

00:28:59.318 --> 00:29:03.266
And, in fact,
many constitutional lawyers in

00:29:03.266 --> 00:29:07.946
the United States were concerned
during the last two

00:29:07.946 --> 00:29:12.536
administrations that the
executive branch too often

00:29:12.536 --> 00:29:19.806
operated by executive orders,
rather than to ask the

00:29:19.806 --> 00:29:27.920
legislature to legislate about
those things.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:33.150
Okay.
 

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:41.215
Now then he goes on and he
said, look, this is not really a

00:29:41.215 --> 00:29:46.640
question of republic versus
monarchy.

00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:52.223
He said, look--in his times--in
most kingdoms of Europe the

00:29:52.223 --> 00:29:55.210
government is quite moderate.
 

00:29:55.210 --> 00:30:03.613
He said, well the prince who
exercises the first two powers,

00:30:03.613 --> 00:30:11.588
well leaves a great deal of
autonomy for its subjects.

00:30:11.588 --> 00:30:15.598
In the Italian republics--they
are republics of his time,

00:30:15.598 --> 00:30:19.569
eighteenth century--the powers
are united and there is less

00:30:19.569 --> 00:30:22.720
liberty actually in these
Italian republics.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:28.049
Well it's an interesting point.
 

00:30:28.049 --> 00:30:33.960
Now about the legislative power.
 

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:39.112
He said, well it's better to be
an elected body which exercises

00:30:39.112 --> 00:30:42.920
the legislative power,
passes the laws,

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:48.868
and--we come close to the idea
of universal suffrage--

00:30:48.868 --> 00:30:53.046
in choosing the representative,
all citizens should have the

00:30:53.046 --> 00:30:55.931
right to vote--
and then comes the

00:30:55.931 --> 00:31:01.162
qualification--except whose
estate is so humble that they

00:31:01.162 --> 00:31:05.180
are deemed to have no will of
their own.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:09.412
In order to have a will you
better be a property owner.

00:31:09.412 --> 00:31:10.038
Right?
 

00:31:10.038 --> 00:31:13.863
There is a suggestion here of
property qualification which was

00:31:13.863 --> 00:31:17.248
quite dominant in the United
States until the twentieth

00:31:17.248 --> 00:31:17.750
century.
 

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.440
Right?
 

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:28.160
But, on the other hand,
he elaborates on it,

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.838
people should not enter
government,

00:31:30.838 --> 00:31:35.503
except to choose their
representatives because in order

00:31:35.503 --> 00:31:40.500
to be in the executive,
you need skills.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:44.346
Well you may know who could be
the right person to run the

00:31:44.346 --> 00:31:47.654
office, but you may not be able
to run the office.

00:31:47.654 --> 00:31:48.329
Right?
 

00:31:48.329 --> 00:31:50.990
That's the fundamental idea.
 

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:59.630
Well it's also important that
this representative body,

00:31:59.630 --> 00:32:07.150
the legislature,
should be separated from actual

00:32:07.150 --> 00:32:08.910
action.
 

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:11.710
Now comes the idea,
the right of minority.

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:17.141
This is a novel idea,
cast in a very conservative

00:32:17.141 --> 00:32:17.818
way.
 

00:32:17.818 --> 00:32:20.490
But though it is cast in a
conservative,

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:24.230
kind of feudal aristocratic
manner--

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:29.288
an aristocrat is speaking--he's
formulating a very important

00:32:29.288 --> 00:32:32.976
principle that we are still
struggling with:

00:32:32.976 --> 00:32:37.863
how to defend the rights of
minorities against a despotism

00:32:37.863 --> 00:32:39.750
of the majority?
 

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:46.959
Just because 51% voted one way
does not mean that 49% is wrong.

00:32:46.959 --> 00:32:47.890
Right?
 

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.374
And the rights of that 49%,
or even just 1%,

00:32:51.374 --> 00:32:55.749
in some ways has to be
guaranteed, and that's what he's

00:32:55.749 --> 00:32:57.368
struggling with.
 

00:32:57.368 --> 00:33:02.508
Now here in this context--and
we'll put the citation on the

00:33:02.508 --> 00:33:05.330
Web;
so I don't want to read this

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:09.750
very long citation--the argument
is for the nobility.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:13.615
He said, well the nobility has
more rights and therefore if

00:33:13.615 --> 00:33:16.282
they have more rights,
more stakes in it,

00:33:16.282 --> 00:33:18.548
they have more than one voice.
 

00:33:18.548 --> 00:33:22.471
Therefore the solution is a two
chamber solution:

00:33:22.471 --> 00:33:26.298
a chamber for the aristocrats,
an upper house,

00:33:26.298 --> 00:33:29.759
and a chamber popularly elected
by everyone,

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:34.068
a lower house--well not in the
aristocratic sense,

00:33:34.068 --> 00:33:38.640
but in some ways representing
the defense of small states,

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.568
and agrarian states.
 

00:33:41.568 --> 00:33:45.652
This is why the Unites States
Senate, every state sends two

00:33:45.652 --> 00:33:49.806
senators rather--irrespective of
the size of the population.

00:33:49.806 --> 00:33:50.509
Right?
 

00:33:50.509 --> 00:33:54.441
And therefore,
though not in a sort of

00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:58.883
feudalistic way,
as Montesquieu meant it,

00:33:58.883 --> 00:34:03.932
but it is- the whole
proposition is very much alive

00:34:03.932 --> 00:34:07.769
in our current political
practices.

00:34:07.769 --> 00:34:16.289
Okay, let me then move on and
talk about the executive power.

00:34:16.289 --> 00:34:20.449
Well the executive power should
be stable--

00:34:20.449 --> 00:34:23.775
that's why he believes it
better be in the hands of a

00:34:23.775 --> 00:34:27.146
monarch--
because the government needs

00:34:27.146 --> 00:34:28.860
immediate action.
 

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:33.643
It cannot leave to a messy
congress to debate things all

00:34:33.643 --> 00:34:34.599
the time.
 

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:40.103
The government has to act
instantly, and therefore it has

00:34:40.103 --> 00:34:42.070
to be in one hand.
 

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:50.139
Well he elaborates a number of
limits of legislative power.

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:52.679
Some of it applies to the
United States;

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:55.820
others don't,
but may apply to Western

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.010
democracies.
 

00:34:57.010 --> 00:35:00.150
It should convene at regular
intervals,

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:03.030
and that's quite true for all
democratic states,

00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:11.409
the legislature is called very
often and with some regularity.

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:15.670
Well it should not be in
session without interruption.

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:20.735
The U.S. Congress is
virtually in session almost

00:35:20.735 --> 00:35:23.429
without interruption.
 

00:35:23.429 --> 00:35:27.152
But other parliaments in
Continental Europe are not

00:35:27.152 --> 00:35:28.420
necessarily so.
 

00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:33.313
The reason is that they don't
want to make membership in the

00:35:33.313 --> 00:35:37.960
legislature the sole source of
occupation and income--

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.829
and there are things which
speaks for this idea,

00:35:40.829 --> 00:35:45.268
that the legislature is not in
permanent session.

00:35:45.268 --> 00:35:48.612
And then he said it should not
have the right to convene

00:35:48.612 --> 00:35:49.159
itself.
 

00:35:49.159 --> 00:35:52.077
Well the U.S. Congress
convenes itself,

00:35:52.077 --> 00:35:55.610
it doesn't need the call of the
executive.

00:35:55.610 --> 00:35:57.443
But in England,
for instance,

00:35:57.443 --> 00:36:01.175
it is the queen who dissolves
the parliament and calls the

00:36:01.175 --> 00:36:03.139
session of the parliament.
 

00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:08.280
Doesn't give her much power,
but nevertheless the idea,

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.945
the Montesquieuian idea,
is present in a number of

00:36:12.945 --> 00:36:15.230
Western democracies.
 

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:18.559
Now regular intervals;
that's obvious,

00:36:18.559 --> 00:36:19.280
right?
 

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.195
It should not be left to the
executive, especially the

00:36:23.195 --> 00:36:27.630
executive has the right to call
into session the legislature.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:28.369
Right?
 

00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:33.809
That may mean the executive
will not call when new laws are

00:36:33.809 --> 00:36:37.000
needed and will become despotic.
 

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:45.079
That's why it has to be called
by regular intervals.

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:51.242
Now and it should not be in
session without interruption

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:57.295
because he said it would
overburden the executive power

00:36:57.295 --> 00:36:58.639
as well.
 

00:36:58.639 --> 00:37:01.820
And it cannot convene itself,
he said--

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:05.621
and the arguments are
known--because if it would have

00:37:05.621 --> 00:37:09.349
the right to decide whether it
dissolves itself,

00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:13.070
it will never dissolve itself;
that's the fundamental argument

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:13.440
here.
 

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.750
As I said, in many countries
this is exercised his way.

00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:20.407
Now the executive,
he said, should be able to

00:37:20.407 --> 00:37:22.820
check over the legislature.
 

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:27.309
And in what way?
 

00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:32.396
Because it doesn't want the
legislature to paralyze the

00:37:32.396 --> 00:37:34.940
action of the government.
 

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:40.983
And the main way how the
executive exercises checks over

00:37:40.983 --> 00:37:46.809
the legislature is the veto
right of the executive;

00:37:46.809 --> 00:37:51.601
exactly like it is done in the
U.S. Constitution,

00:37:51.601 --> 00:37:52.599
right?
 

00:37:52.599 --> 00:37:56.413
The President can veto laws
which are passed by Congress,

00:37:56.413 --> 00:37:59.954
has to send back to Congress,
and the Congress has to

00:37:59.954 --> 00:38:02.610
overrule the veto of the
President.

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:08.460
There is a clear check of the
executive over the legislature.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:09.239
Right?
 

00:38:09.239 --> 00:38:14.103
The executive has the
possibility to remind the

00:38:14.103 --> 00:38:19.920
legislature, this may be a bad
idea to pass this law;

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:24.760
you better rethink it before it
becomes a law.

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.130
Well checks and balances over
the executive branch.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:31.099
He is quite a conservative here.
 

00:38:31.099 --> 00:38:37.503
He said the executive power
belongs to the legislative,

00:38:37.503 --> 00:38:42.010
only through its faculty of
vetoing.

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:52.184
The executive power--it's very
important--enacts the rising of

00:38:52.184 --> 00:39:00.860
public funds only with the
consent of legislature.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:04.364
This is again a very important
principle ruling all

00:39:04.364 --> 00:39:08.217
democracies--that the budgets
have to be approved by the

00:39:08.217 --> 00:39:09.340
legislature.
 

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:14.826
Just see the mess what we have
seen in California recently,

00:39:14.826 --> 00:39:19.840
where the legislature was not
giving the budget to the

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.070
governor.
 

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:25.376
But this is certainly a very
important principle of

00:39:25.376 --> 00:39:26.409
democracy.
 

00:39:26.409 --> 00:39:33.193
And now let me come to the
question of environment and

00:39:33.193 --> 00:39:41.003
society, and the whole idea that
the physical conditions shape

00:39:41.003 --> 00:39:43.820
social conditions.
 

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:47.693
And let me give you a couple
of, as I said,

00:39:47.693 --> 00:39:49.539
quite silly notes.
 

00:39:49.539 --> 00:39:54.347
He said that "spirit and
passion are extremely different

00:39:54.347 --> 00:39:58.862
in various climates,
laws should be relative to the

00:39:58.862 --> 00:40:02.159
differences in these
passions."

00:40:02.159 --> 00:40:05.530
And now comes the real silly
one.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:11.106
"In cold climate,
the blood is pushed harder

00:40:11.106 --> 00:40:13.429
forward the heart.
 

00:40:13.429 --> 00:40:17.798
This produces confidence in
oneself, and courage,

00:40:17.798 --> 00:40:20.440
and better knowledge."
 

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:26.231
So you are more courageous,
more active and smarter if you

00:40:26.231 --> 00:40:31.719
live in cold climates,
like in France or in England.

00:40:31.719 --> 00:40:37.670
People in hot countries are
"timid, like old men."

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:43.389
I'm not all that timid. Okay.
 

00:40:43.389 --> 00:40:46.911
And then interestingly,
you know, to sort of distance

00:40:46.911 --> 00:40:49.934
himself from racism--
and that's a term which did not

00:40:49.934 --> 00:40:53.382
exist in his time--
he said even the children of

00:40:53.382 --> 00:40:59.106
Europeans born inside the Indies
lose the courage of the European

00:40:59.106 --> 00:41:00.090
climate.
 

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:05.590
Well, at least it is not based
on a racial argument,

00:41:05.590 --> 00:41:11.306
but indeed based on an
extremely naïve ecological

00:41:11.306 --> 00:41:12.710
argument.
 

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:15.891
But let me emphasize,
there is fantastic insight

00:41:15.891 --> 00:41:16.840
here, right?
 

00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.523
For another 200,
nobody took the environment

00:41:21.523 --> 00:41:24.117
seriously;
I mean, with the exception of

00:41:24.117 --> 00:41:25.139
Émile Durkheim.
 

00:41:25.139 --> 00:41:28.371
We will talk about this when we
talk about Durkheim,

00:41:28.371 --> 00:41:30.018
coming from Montesquieu.
 

00:41:30.018 --> 00:41:32.771
For Durkheim,
Montesquieu and Rousseau were

00:41:32.771 --> 00:41:33.360
the gods.
 

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:33.949
Right?
 

00:41:33.949 --> 00:41:37.760
That's where modern theory of
society came from.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:42.219
It was Montesquieu and
Rousseau, both of them.

00:41:42.219 --> 00:41:47.829
So, and now about the
"general spirit."

00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:52.099
He said, well many things
govern man: climate,

00:41:52.099 --> 00:41:56.309
religion, laws,
the maxims of government,

00:41:56.309 --> 00:42:00.969
mores and manners--there is
this all adds together,

00:42:00.969 --> 00:42:04.704
a general spirit,
which is formed as a result.

00:42:04.704 --> 00:42:05.369
Right?
 

00:42:05.369 --> 00:42:10.119
I hope you get the idea of the
general spirit that there is a

00:42:10.119 --> 00:42:14.789
set of ideas which is above our
individual consciousness.

00:42:14.789 --> 00:42:19.800
In childhood we learn,
we internalize those ideas.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.210
It is not coming from the
individual;

00:42:22.210 --> 00:42:25.936
it is entering the individual
in the process of education.

00:42:25.936 --> 00:42:26.460
Right?
 

00:42:26.460 --> 00:42:29.726
And therefore,
the argument what Montesquieu

00:42:29.726 --> 00:42:32.614
makes,
repeated by Rousseau and

00:42:32.614 --> 00:42:36.603
Durkheim, that we can have,
and should have,

00:42:36.603 --> 00:42:40.329
an idea of society or
collective consciousness

00:42:40.329 --> 00:42:43.889
extending over and above the
individual.

00:42:43.889 --> 00:42:49.329
This is a big debate which
informs most of the debates in

00:42:49.329 --> 00:42:51.659
social sciences today.
 

00:42:51.659 --> 00:42:55.018
In economics,
in political science,

00:42:55.018 --> 00:42:57.739
in sociology,
in anthropology,

00:42:57.739 --> 00:43:02.239
you have some scholars who
regard themselves--

00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:04.938
in an economics
few--methodological

00:43:04.938 --> 00:43:09.461
collectivists and those who call
themselves methodological

00:43:09.461 --> 00:43:13.369
individualists;
rational choice people are the

00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:15.849
methodological individualists.
 

00:43:15.849 --> 00:43:19.481
The cultural analysts are
methodological collectivists,

00:43:19.481 --> 00:43:20.018
right?
 

00:43:20.018 --> 00:43:22.969
We have that distinction
virtually everywhere;

00:43:22.969 --> 00:43:24.809
as I said, the least in
economics.

00:43:24.809 --> 00:43:31.221
But even in economics you have
the institutionalists who are on

00:43:31.221 --> 00:43:37.012
the edge of between being
methodological collectivists or

00:43:37.012 --> 00:43:41.150
being methodological
individualists.

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:46.126
And then well he says as
civilization unfolds,

00:43:46.126 --> 00:43:52.429
the importance of the general
spirit is increasing and the

00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:56.300
impact of climate is declining.
 

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.902
Not that climate doesn't
matter, but over time its

00:43:59.902 --> 00:44:04.239
importance declines and the
importance of general experience

00:44:04.239 --> 00:44:05.269
increases.
 

00:44:05.269 --> 00:44:07.500
Well that's about it for today.
 

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:08.710
Thank you.
 

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:18.000

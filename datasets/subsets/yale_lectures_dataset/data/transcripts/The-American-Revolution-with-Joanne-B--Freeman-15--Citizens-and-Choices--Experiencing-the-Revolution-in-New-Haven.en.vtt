00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:04.198
Prof: Now I want to turn
to the lecture,

00:00:04.198 --> 00:00:07.975
and I'm going to start the
lecture with my true confession

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:08.970
of the day.
 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.212
Okay.
 

00:00:09.212 --> 00:00:12.123
I did something a little insane
and I'm not entirely sure how

00:00:12.123 --> 00:00:13.530
this is going to work out.
 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.750
I did it for you.
 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.518
I--Basically,
on the syllabus it says that

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.632
the title of this lecture is
"Citizenship and

00:00:19.632 --> 00:00:21.314
Leadership"
or "Leadership and

00:00:21.314 --> 00:00:22.350
Citizenship."
 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.040
I don't even remember which one
I put first.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.133
And initially,
my idea had been when I wrote

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:30.874
the syllabus for this course
before the semester even

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:33.539
started--
well, this is going to be a

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.870
lecture that has something to do
with new ways of--

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.199
how the Revolution changed
people's sense of themselves as

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.952
citizens,
how people were behaving

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:44.452
differently because of the
approach of Revolution and then

00:00:44.452 --> 00:00:46.250
because of the fighting of
Revolution.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.242
And I was going to talk a
little bit about crowd actions

00:00:49.242 --> 00:00:52.506
and about how the Revolution
itself wouldn't really have been

00:00:52.506 --> 00:00:54.410
possible without crowd actions.
 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.260
I talked, I know,
a little bit about mob actions

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.520
and we've seen some in action.
 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.865
So I was basically going to
talk about how the Revolution

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:03.932
politicized people,
how it--on a mass scale for

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:06.269
many different kinds of
Americans--

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:08.860
brought them in to the public
sphere,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.671
made them think and act
politically in a way that

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.370
perhaps they hadn't before.
 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.524
And then I was going to
accompany that with a brief

00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:20.183
discussion about the elite in
this environment being on the

00:01:20.183 --> 00:01:23.968
one hand appreciative of the
sort of mass popular involvement

00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:27.438
because there would be no
Revolution without it--

00:01:27.438 --> 00:01:32.173
that is the Revolution--but on
the other hand they're elite

00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:34.828
folk so they're all--
some of them at least are a

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:36.587
little nervous about all of this
sort of popular sentiment and

00:01:36.587 --> 00:01:37.050
crowd action.
 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.120
And I even had--let me find my
favorite arrogant aristocratic

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.530
quote.
 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.919
Okay.
 

00:01:40.919 --> 00:01:45.435
So I even found random arrogant
elite guy quote in 1774 who

00:01:45.435 --> 00:01:49.717
observed with true disdain:
"The mob begin to think

00:01:49.717 --> 00:01:51.430
and reason."
 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.845
This is Gouverneur Morris,
who actually has a really great

00:01:54.845 --> 00:01:58.381
sense of humor but also he's
really kind of aristocratically

00:01:58.381 --> 00:01:59.280
disdainful.
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.213
And he says he believes
"with fear and trembling

00:02:02.213 --> 00:02:04.810
that if the disputes with
Britain continue,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.000
we shall be under the worst of
all possible dominions.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.670
We shall be under the
domination of a riotous

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.400
mob."
 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.685
Okay.
 

00:02:11.685 --> 00:02:14.941
So Gouverneur Morris is an
extreme example of some sort of

00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:17.510
elite concern about what the
Revolution means,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.310
what does it mean that people
are rising up.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.710
So that was going to be today's
lecture.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.110
That was my plan.
 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.740
But when I started thinking
about the lecture and thinking

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.479
about just preparing it and
tweaking it,

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.068
and again I had last thought
about it back in December--

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:36.718
and you know,
when you make a syllabus for a

00:02:36.718 --> 00:02:39.000
course you think about the
course,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.807
you outline it,
you think it's all going to go

00:02:40.807 --> 00:02:42.252
well,
and then you get halfway

00:02:42.252 --> 00:02:45.157
through the course and sometimes
different things seem exciting

00:02:45.157 --> 00:02:47.264
to you or you suddenly get a gut
feeling that:

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:49.354
'wow,
I was going to have a really

00:02:49.354 --> 00:02:52.482
abstract discussion today,
and I don't want to have an

00:02:52.482 --> 00:02:53.690
abstract discussion.
 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.229
[laughs]
I want us to be grounded in the

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:56.060
actual Revolution.'
 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.690
All of those things happened to
me when I was thinking about

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.163
today's lecture,
and I decided at the absolute

00:03:02.163 --> 00:03:04.408
last minute I wasn't going to
give that lecture--

00:03:04.408 --> 00:03:07.210
at literally the absolute last
minute.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.626
Today--This morning for me was
like a reality show called

00:03:09.626 --> 00:03:11.264
"The Lecture"
and I was like:

00:03:11.264 --> 00:03:13.875
'Freeman,
three hours--research and write

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:14.908
a new lecture.'
 

00:03:14.908 --> 00:03:16.770
So I was sort of frantically at
my desk.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.711
So not only did I research and
write a new lecture,

00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:22.419
but it's based entirely on
primary research.

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:24.538
So I mean--I really researched,
you'll hear,

00:03:24.538 --> 00:03:27.183
and I'm going to explain in a
moment what I'm actually going

00:03:27.183 --> 00:03:29.722
to be lecturing on,
which is related to what I'm

00:03:29.722 --> 00:03:31.330
supposed to be lecturing on.
 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.709
But basically I just came up
with something that to me felt

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.307
more interesting,
more immediate,

00:03:35.307 --> 00:03:38.216
that's going to show some of
the same things I would have

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:41.092
been talking about in my big,
broad, general way with my

00:03:41.092 --> 00:03:42.750
leadership and citizenship
lecture,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.676
but instead I'm actually going
to base it on real people in a

00:03:45.676 --> 00:03:48.387
real place,
sort of really showing you as

00:03:48.387 --> 00:03:52.723
the Revolution's unfolding what
happens to people in this place

00:03:52.723 --> 00:03:55.729
and how do events and ideas
affect them.

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:58.848
So when I said I hope I have a
minute or two at the end--

00:03:58.848 --> 00:04:01.764
given that I literally was
printing this out as I was

00:04:01.764 --> 00:04:05.102
grabbing my coat to run here,
hopefully this is all going to

00:04:05.102 --> 00:04:07.210
work and the lecture will go
swimmingly.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.490
This is true confessions.
 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.710
Right?
 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.363
I should never get up in front
of you and say,

00:04:10.363 --> 00:04:11.870
"Maybe my lecture will
die."

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.163
[laughter]
Okay.

00:04:13.163 --> 00:04:17.480
Hopefully, it won't die,
but I'm going to aim for a

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.069
grand slam, and we'll try.
 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.651
But one way or another,
what I am going to do today is

00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:25.624
get across some of the ideas in
a concrete way that I had been

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:28.742
thinking I was going to approach
in an abstract way and that just

00:04:28.742 --> 00:04:30.790
didn't get me excited this
morning,

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.819
so it's a little experiment for
me.

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.620
And what I'm going to do,
my little experimental thing,

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.115
is I'm actually going to be
talking about citizenship and

00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:43.675
leadership and the American
Revolution by focusing on Yale

00:04:43.675 --> 00:04:44.800
and New Haven.
 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.990
This was my brilliant thought
for the morning.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.100
Ah ha, I could focus right here.
 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.990
I could talk about us here now,
and look at--

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.291
throughout the 1770s--some of
the ways in which people were

00:04:56.291 --> 00:04:58.569
actually experiencing the
Revolution,

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.120
some of the ways in which the
Revolution was getting them to

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.713
take action,
what it is they were doing,

00:05:02.713 --> 00:05:04.800
why they were doing it,
who was doing it,

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.439
who was taking action.
 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.752
So again we're not just going
to be looking at three elite

00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:11.269
guys in a room sort of writing
proclamations but we're actually

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.502
going to be talking about
students and the people of New

00:05:13.502 --> 00:05:13.990
Haven.
 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.019
So that's my experimental
lecture for this morning and,

00:05:18.019 --> 00:05:21.740
as you're going to see,
average New Haven residents

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.129
took strong action at an early
point in the growing conflict

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.329
between the colonies and Great
Britain.

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:33.202
So really, in a main and a sort
of major way what we're going to

00:05:33.202 --> 00:05:36.584
be looking at is their story
today, the story of average

00:05:36.584 --> 00:05:38.060
people in New Haven.
 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.315
Students are kind of above
average because they would have

00:05:40.315 --> 00:05:41.699
been from more elevated
families.

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.209
We're going to be looking at
students too,

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.742
but we're going to be looking
at a lot of what's happening

00:05:45.742 --> 00:05:48.596
just in the town of New Haven,
which in a way is the best way

00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:51.398
to look at the Revolution,
which is really how it's

00:05:51.398 --> 00:05:52.970
unfolding on the ground.
 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.875
Plus this means I get to talk
about the British invasion of

00:05:55.875 --> 00:05:58.480
New Haven, which--I've been
waiting for my moment.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.370
I've never actually talked
about it in this class before.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.089
I discovered it when I was
writing the introductory lecture

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:05.528
and then having discovered it it
was like: 'okay,

00:06:05.528 --> 00:06:07.848
well, now I have to find a way
to talk about the invasion of

00:06:07.848 --> 00:06:08.360
New Haven.'
 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.949
So after I had my brilliant
idea I realized ha,

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:12.795
[laughs]
this means I get to talk about

00:06:12.795 --> 00:06:16.240
the attack on New Haven in
today's lecture--

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.069
so that will be there today too.
 

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:18.459
Okay.
 

00:06:18.459 --> 00:06:22.675
So let's actually turn now to
Yale and New Haven at the

00:06:22.675 --> 00:06:24.939
opening of the Revolution.
 

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:29.250
And most of the lecture today
is going to focus on the 1770s,

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.665
but I will mention in starting
that Yale students were

00:06:32.665 --> 00:06:36.144
certainly caught up in all of
the fervor that I've been

00:06:36.144 --> 00:06:38.399
talking about in past lectures.
 

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:41.964
And I know I mentioned once
before that Yale students

00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:46.560
decided in protest at one point
to give up importing fine wines,

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:50.250
[laughs]--the sacrifice--on the
part of Yale students.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.658
In the 1760s,
Yale students,

00:06:51.658 --> 00:06:54.269
like many other people
throughout the colonies,

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:58.449
were engaged in acts of sort of
personal protest like that,

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:59.490
giving something up.
 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.706
Okay.
 

00:06:59.706 --> 00:07:02.170
Maybe on the part of Yale
students it was just fine wines,

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.511
but still--
Or on another occasion in 1769

00:07:05.511 --> 00:07:10.264
in response to the Townshend
Acts and then the idea of

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:13.980
non-importation,
the senior class of Yale came

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.430
up with the following
proclamation,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.112
which they made publicly:
"The Senior Class of Yale

00:07:20.112 --> 00:07:23.714
College have unanimously agreed
to make their Appearance at the

00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:27.295
next public Commencement,
when they are to take their

00:07:27.295 --> 00:07:29.456
first Degree,
wholly dressed in the

00:07:29.456 --> 00:07:32.358
Manufacturers of our own
Country: And desire this public

00:07:32.358 --> 00:07:34.680
Notice may be given of their
Resolution,

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.613
so their Parents and Friends
may have sufficient Time to be

00:07:37.613 --> 00:07:39.839
providing Homespun Cloaths for
them."

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:41.261
[laughter]
It was like:

00:07:41.261 --> 00:07:43.329
'we are making a proclamation.
 

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:44.699
Mom, send me some clothes.'
 

00:07:44.699 --> 00:07:47.269
[laughter] That was like--okay.
 

00:07:47.269 --> 00:07:50.389
[laughs]
But the feeling was there.

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:51.762
[laughs]
And even better,

00:07:51.762 --> 00:07:54.910
they want their parents to
provide homespun clothes,

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.166
"that none of them may be
obliged to the hard Necessity of

00:07:58.166 --> 00:08:01.329
unfashionable Singularity,
by wearing imported Cloth."

00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:01.619
Okay.
 

00:08:01.619 --> 00:08:03.759
'Mom, if you don't send me
clothes,

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:05.550
I'm going to have to wear
imported clothes and I'm going

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:07.338
to be really unpopular'--
so--[laughter]

00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:08.769
guilting the parents.
 

00:08:08.769 --> 00:08:12.653
Okay, but anyway that's--Yale
students of the 1760s actually

00:08:12.653 --> 00:08:15.879
making acts of protest,
organizing themselves into

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:17.129
active protest.
 

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:21.589
Now Yale isn't unique in this
way, actually.

00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:25.290
Throughout the--this period,
colonial colleges in a variety

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.439
of different places were places
that tended to brew sentiment--

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:33.225
political sentiment that was
rebellious or outraged at some

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:36.750
of the acts being imposed by the
British government.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.870
Actually, Yale and Harvard and
the College of New Jersey,

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.990
which is now Princeton,
tended to be particularly

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:45.850
well-known as sort of seedbeds
of unrest--

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.889
particularly angry students who
had strong political feelings,

00:08:49.889 --> 00:08:54.143
but there were other colleges
as well where the students

00:08:54.143 --> 00:08:58.320
really were provoked to acts of
protest in a variety of

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.788
different ways.
 

00:08:59.788 --> 00:09:02.590
And I--this morning in
researching for this lecture,

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.990
I found a bunch of
Princeton/College of New Jersey

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:10.364
students who decided that no one
in Princeton should be drinking

00:09:10.364 --> 00:09:10.918
tea.
 

00:09:10.918 --> 00:09:13.947
So they went out into the town
and just personally forced their

00:09:13.947 --> 00:09:16.878
way in to people's houses and
when they found tea they burned

00:09:16.878 --> 00:09:17.220
it.
 

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.294
That would be really
popular--right?--and then one of

00:09:19.294 --> 00:09:21.130
them said something like,
"That was a real

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:21.809
frolic."
 

00:09:21.809 --> 00:09:23.519
[laughter] Okay.
 

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.359
[laughs]
The town must have been very

00:09:25.359 --> 00:09:25.870
pleased.
 

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:31.019
I think in another college the
commencement exercises,

00:09:31.019 --> 00:09:33.808
the speeches that the students
gave at a commencement exercise,

00:09:33.808 --> 00:09:37.808
at a pretty early point
actually, they debated,

00:09:37.808 --> 00:09:41.039
one for, one and against the
possibility of independence.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:43.320
I think that was in 1769.
 

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.708
You had students at one college
who decided that would be what

00:09:45.708 --> 00:09:47.902
would be happening at their
commencement ceremony is they

00:09:47.902 --> 00:09:48.960
would have that debate.
 

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.330
It's a really early point and
again, pretty radical.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:55.860
So we're kind of looking at a
long-standing pattern of college

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.100
students being bold and radical
during times of political

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.298
controversy and political
unrest,

00:10:01.298 --> 00:10:04.154
and this is happening
throughout the colonies in this

00:10:04.154 --> 00:10:04.649
period.
 

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:06.798
And it kind of makes sense.
 

00:10:06.798 --> 00:10:08.817
You have a cluster of people
together and you have a variety

00:10:08.817 --> 00:10:12.191
of different avenues,
ways for students to make their

00:10:12.191 --> 00:10:14.428
thoughts known,
so colleges and,

00:10:14.428 --> 00:10:17.312
as I said, particularly Yale
became known as the sort of

00:10:17.312 --> 00:10:18.519
seedbed of sedition.
 

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:22.658
As one Loyalist said of Yale in
the 1770s,

00:10:22.658 --> 00:10:25.767
The college is no longer
remarkable for its scholarship

00:10:25.767 --> 00:10:28.528
but instead for "its
persecuting spirit,

00:10:28.528 --> 00:10:30.921
its republican principles,
its intolerance in

00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:32.937
religion"--
but this is a person of

00:10:32.937 --> 00:10:35.323
Loyalist sympathies,
who says, 'Yale used to be

00:10:35.323 --> 00:10:35.700
great.
 

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.269
It's all downhill now.
 

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:39.158
They have those crazy,
wild, radical students.'

00:10:39.158 --> 00:10:43.149
Or, as a British officer put it
in 1779--

00:10:43.149 --> 00:10:46.610
he happens to be the British
officer who invaded New Haven--

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:50.052
quote, "That place (New
Haven) is a spacious and very

00:10:50.052 --> 00:10:52.682
considerable town;
it has the largest university

00:10:52.682 --> 00:10:55.429
in America, and might with
propriety be styled the parent

00:10:55.429 --> 00:10:57.000
and nurse of rebellion."
 

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:57.428
Okay.
 

00:10:57.428 --> 00:11:01.451
We are the parent and nurse of
rebellion--'Yale,

00:11:01.451 --> 00:11:02.649
hate Yale.'
 

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:06.197
Okay, but this is not to say
that colleges in this period are

00:11:06.197 --> 00:11:09.625
little isolated seedbeds of
rebellion and everybody else is

00:11:09.625 --> 00:11:12.759
sort of sitting around whittling
pieces of wood,

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:14.182
thinking, 'oh,
I wonder what the British are

00:11:14.182 --> 00:11:14.678
doing today.'
 

00:11:14.678 --> 00:11:14.948
Right?
 

00:11:14.948 --> 00:11:17.282
It's not as though the colleges
are isolated from the

00:11:17.282 --> 00:11:20.154
communities or that the colleges
only notice the communities when

00:11:20.154 --> 00:11:23.027
they're going to go out and burn
random citizens' tea as they did

00:11:23.027 --> 00:11:23.970
in New Jersey.
 

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.126
There were obviously,
there were connections between

00:11:26.126 --> 00:11:28.706
whatever was going on in these
colleges and whatever was going

00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:31.086
on in these towns,
and we're going to see that

00:11:31.086 --> 00:11:33.690
play out a couple of times in
this lecture today.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:37.259
Sometimes things that went on
in the town spread their way

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:38.700
onto the Yale campus.
 

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.654
An example of this is in the
late 1760s when there was a

00:11:42.654 --> 00:11:46.970
rally on the New Haven town
green against British policy,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.813
and the Yale students
apparently attended that rally

00:11:49.813 --> 00:11:53.270
and got very stirred up by the
rally and decided to continue it

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:56.230
on the Yale campus,
at which point a big group of

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:59.475
students decided it would be a
really great idea to declare

00:11:59.475 --> 00:12:02.717
their political sentiments by
toasting English radical John

00:12:02.717 --> 00:12:03.389
Wilkes.
 

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.576
And they decided not--And I
don't know where this number

00:12:06.576 --> 00:12:08.592
came from,
because I didn't have time to

00:12:08.592 --> 00:12:10.250
research where the number came
from,

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:11.759
but you'll hear why I
questioned it.

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:15.337
They decided that they would
toast John Wilkes forty-five

00:12:15.337 --> 00:12:15.850
times.
 

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:17.490
[laughter] Okay.
 

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.019
That's forty-five drinks.
 

00:12:19.019 --> 00:12:20.515
[laughs]
So one observer,

00:12:20.515 --> 00:12:23.881
who I gather from my research
this morning had Loyalist

00:12:23.881 --> 00:12:26.566
sympathies,
said that "instead of

00:12:26.566 --> 00:12:30.198
drinking 45 glasses in honor of
Wilkes and Liberty,"

00:12:30.198 --> 00:12:34.157
the Yale students "drank
themselves 45 degrees in extremo

00:12:34.157 --> 00:12:35.259
DRUNK."
 

00:12:35.259 --> 00:12:39.025
[laughter]
So we've got plastered Yale

00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:43.200
students like:
'yeah, liberty'--[laughter]

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:49.408
but that's the town spreading
into the realm of the gown.

00:12:49.408 --> 00:12:53.417
Now, in the 1660s we're seeing
these sort of public

00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:56.455
demonstrations--
New Haven, Yale campus

00:12:56.455 --> 00:12:59.667
protesting policies--
but not anything that dramatic

00:12:59.667 --> 00:13:00.259
happening.
 

00:13:00.259 --> 00:13:04.927
But things become worse as
relations between England and

00:13:04.927 --> 00:13:10.192
its colonies became worse and as
actions became more aggressive

00:13:10.192 --> 00:13:11.720
on both sides.
 

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:14.283
People in New Haven,
as in a lot of other places,

00:13:14.283 --> 00:13:17.597
became more aggressive in their
politics and became stronger in

00:13:17.597 --> 00:13:18.558
their actions.
 

00:13:18.558 --> 00:13:22.479
They made bolder decisions,
and a great example of that is

00:13:22.479 --> 00:13:24.678
again here in New Haven,
1774.

00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:28.308
A group of about sixty men from
New Haven,

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:31.428
normal townspeople--I'm going
to talk about them in a moment--

00:13:31.428 --> 00:13:34.551
decided that they were going to
hire someone to teach them

00:13:34.551 --> 00:13:37.399
military exercises so that
hopefully they would learn

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:40.630
something and that somewhere
down the road if they had to be

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.025
they could organize themselves
into a military unit and protect

00:13:44.025 --> 00:13:45.668
the town of New Haven.
 

00:13:45.668 --> 00:13:46.004
Okay.
 

00:13:46.004 --> 00:13:50.149
So here's sixty random people
in New Haven who hire someone--

00:13:50.149 --> 00:13:53.519
I think they paid him three
dollars a lesson or something--

00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:55.740
to teach them how to drill,
and what to do with guns,

00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.633
and how to walk in formation,
and basic military things so

00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:02.450
that they would know what to do,
in case they ever actually had

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:03.129
to fight.
 

00:14:03.129 --> 00:14:05.250
Again that's kind of a dramatic
action.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.590
That's a big step to take.
 

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.895
'Okay.
 

00:14:06.895 --> 00:14:09.605
Now I need to be militarily
drilling in case I need to

00:14:09.605 --> 00:14:11.089
defend my family,
my property,

00:14:11.089 --> 00:14:12.009
and my town.'
 

00:14:12.009 --> 00:14:15.798
So that certainly gives you a
sense of what it felt like,

00:14:15.798 --> 00:14:18.710
what was sort of floating in
the air at this time for people

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.980
in New Haven to take that kind
of an action.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.808
In early 1775,
they met as a group and they

00:14:23.808 --> 00:14:27.918
decided that they would really
organize themselves into a real

00:14:27.918 --> 00:14:30.330
military unit,
as opposed to guys taking

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.460
lessons on how to drill.
 

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.330
So they met,
they voted on uniforms,

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.461
they figured out the best way
to obtain arms so that they'd

00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:39.730
know where they'd be getting
them from,

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:42.408
and then not long after that
they actually wrote to the

00:14:42.408 --> 00:14:44.840
Connecticut State Assembly and
said that they,

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.836
quote, "Anxious for the
safety of our country and

00:14:47.836 --> 00:14:51.230
desirous of contributing all in
their power to the support of

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.438
our just rights and liberties,
have formed themselves into a

00:14:54.438 --> 00:14:57.202
military company"--
and then added that they wanted

00:14:57.202 --> 00:15:00.496
the Connecticut State Assembly
to officially make them a sort

00:15:00.496 --> 00:15:02.090
of district military unit.
 

00:15:02.090 --> 00:15:04.953
So they wanted official
recognition from the Connecticut

00:15:04.953 --> 00:15:05.840
State Assembly.
 

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.173
Again, really
interesting--random sixty guys:

00:15:08.173 --> 00:15:10.509
'maybe we better know something
military.'

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:12.424
Then after that they decide:
'oh, okay, well,

00:15:12.424 --> 00:15:14.427
maybe we actually had
better--we could organize

00:15:14.427 --> 00:15:16.558
ourselves so that this will
actually be real.

00:15:16.558 --> 00:15:17.879
Hey, now that we've organized
ourselves,

00:15:17.879 --> 00:15:20.929
we can actually get state
recognition so that we'll be on

00:15:20.929 --> 00:15:24.090
call and armed and ready in case
something bad happens.'

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.601
Again kind of an interesting
chain of events,

00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:30.082
series of personal decisions on
the part of those random sixty

00:15:30.082 --> 00:15:30.538
men.
 

00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:33.639
Now let's look for a minute at
who they are.

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:37.580
One of them apparently owned a
hat store on Chapel Street.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.057
One of them was a barber who
was described,

00:15:40.057 --> 00:15:43.009
quote, as "a rather
eccentric person."

00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:45.346
I don't know what that means,
although I was dying to have

00:15:45.346 --> 00:15:47.889
the time to figure out why the
barber was rather eccentric,

00:15:47.889 --> 00:15:50.548
but we have an eccentric barber
who's one of the sixty,

00:15:50.548 --> 00:15:52.243
a chair maker,
a few sailors,

00:15:52.243 --> 00:15:55.509
someone who was just described
as a man of leisure--

00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:59.320
[laughter]--it's interesting to
ponder what that means--

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.750
a lawyer, a few grocers.
 

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.587
There was a grocer who lived on
State Street and a grocer who

00:16:04.587 --> 00:16:06.668
lived on the corner of Chapel
and Church--

00:16:06.668 --> 00:16:08.288
and of course for me
researching this this morning,

00:16:08.288 --> 00:16:11.095
it's really fascinating to be
finding people living in places

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:13.190
that,
of course, we all know.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.390
That's always--Because you can
exactly picture:

00:16:15.390 --> 00:16:17.210
oh, the corner of Chapel and
Church.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.350
I know exactly where that
person lived.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.405
One person worked in the New
Haven bank, and decided that he

00:16:23.405 --> 00:16:26.500
wasn't really very skilled at
horsemanship;

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:29.110
in case that they were going to
fight, he probably would need to

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.850
know how to be really good on
horseback.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.866
So apparently he regularly took
his horse into his yard and

00:16:33.866 --> 00:16:35.740
practiced on the horse in
private.

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.039
He took it into his yard so no
one would see that he was the

00:16:38.039 --> 00:16:39.600
guy who had to practice
horsemanship,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.538
but he was sort of there doing
his own little private drilling

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:45.480
so that he'd be prepared in case
there was actual fighting.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:45.913
Okay.
 

00:16:45.913 --> 00:16:49.129
So there you see a group of
people,

00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:51.769
all different levels of
society--lawyers,

00:16:51.769 --> 00:16:54.841
man of leisure,
eccentric barbers,

00:16:54.841 --> 00:16:57.985
chair makers,
grocers--all different levels

00:16:57.985 --> 00:17:01.243
of society who have all come
together for this one purpose

00:17:01.243 --> 00:17:04.500
and have gone over a series of
months here to increasingly

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:07.757
become more and more serious
about what it is that they're

00:17:07.757 --> 00:17:08.500
doing.
 

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.920
So it certainly tells you
something about the mindset in

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.029
New Haven in early 1775,
and not only in New Haven,

00:17:15.029 --> 00:17:17.578
as we've already heard in the
course.

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:21.823
Things became more dramatic on
April 21,1775,

00:17:21.823 --> 00:17:27.608
when news of the Battle of
Lexington arrived in New Haven.

00:17:27.608 --> 00:17:30.752
And what was interesting to me
this morning was when I was

00:17:30.752 --> 00:17:33.951
reading accounts of people in
New Haven reporting when they

00:17:33.951 --> 00:17:36.936
heard this news,
several of them literally

00:17:36.936 --> 00:17:41.551
stated the precise time of day,
like: 'at noon on the 21^(st)

00:17:41.551 --> 00:17:42.920
someone told me.'
 

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:45.680
They actually had it down to
the hour and the minute when

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.848
they heard about the events at
Lexington,

00:17:47.848 --> 00:17:50.670
which to me was really telling,
because it's what you do--

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:53.938
afterwards--when something
really momentous or tragic or

00:17:53.938 --> 00:17:56.904
notable or historic happens,
you think: where was I when

00:17:56.904 --> 00:17:57.529
that happened?
 

00:17:57.529 --> 00:18:01.818
Where was I when the Challenger
blew up?

00:18:01.818 --> 00:18:05.009
I was a receptionist at an
advertising agency sitting at my

00:18:05.009 --> 00:18:06.442
desk,
but I remember that,

00:18:06.442 --> 00:18:09.275
because I remember everyone
around me getting upset and it

00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:10.170
was a big deal.
 

00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.978
And so here are these people
kind of doing the same thing,

00:18:12.978 --> 00:18:15.640
remembering after the fact:
'I remember where I was.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.559
It was noon on the 21^(st) when
we heard in New Haven that the

00:18:19.559 --> 00:18:23.160
British had actually fired on
colonists in Lexington.'

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.983
In New Haven,
a Yale student wrote in his

00:18:25.983 --> 00:18:30.009
diary: "Today tidings of
the Battle of Lexington,

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:32.450
which is the first engagement
with the British troops,

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.328
arrived at New Haven.
 

00:18:34.328 --> 00:18:37.794
This filled the country with
alarm and rendered it impossible

00:18:37.794 --> 00:18:40.740
for us to pursue our studies to
any profit."

00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:44.415
And this is the moment I
mentioned in Tuesday's lecture

00:18:44.415 --> 00:18:47.472
when Benedict Arnold--
who is one of the men in that

00:18:47.472 --> 00:18:50.420
group of sixty guys who decide
they'd better arm and drill;

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.952
he's one of those men--when he
decides that they need arms and

00:18:52.952 --> 00:18:54.740
they're going to march to
Massachusetts,

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.721
and he sort of fights the New
Haven town committee to get the

00:18:57.721 --> 00:19:00.654
key so that he can grab arms and
go march with his men up to

00:19:00.654 --> 00:19:01.548
Massachusetts.
 

00:19:01.548 --> 00:19:04.307
So I'm linking today's lecture
with Tuesday's lecture,

00:19:04.307 --> 00:19:05.348
so I'm very proud.
 

00:19:05.348 --> 00:19:07.157
And actually,
he and his men,

00:19:07.157 --> 00:19:10.838
as they were preparing to leave
town and sort of go off to

00:19:10.838 --> 00:19:13.353
fight,
they drew up an agreement which

00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:15.871
they all signed,
a sort of pledge to each other,

00:19:15.871 --> 00:19:18.528
and a public statement as to
what they were doing and why

00:19:18.528 --> 00:19:21.095
they were doing it,
which is worth quoting because

00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:24.096
you'll hear in the middle of it
something you might not expect

00:19:24.096 --> 00:19:26.948
to see in a statement being
drawn up by a bunch of guys who

00:19:26.948 --> 00:19:29.058
just--
by force--armed themselves and

00:19:29.058 --> 00:19:31.884
they're going to go march to
Massachusetts to fight the

00:19:31.884 --> 00:19:32.460
British.
 

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:34.681
So this is the beginning of
their statement:

00:19:34.681 --> 00:19:37.111
"Be it known that we,
the subscribers,

00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:40.256
having taken up arms for the
relief of our brethren and

00:19:40.256 --> 00:19:42.259
defense of their,
as well as our,

00:19:42.259 --> 00:19:45.615
just rights and privileges,
declare to the world that we

00:19:45.615 --> 00:19:49.307
from our hearts disavow every
thought of rebellion to His

00:19:49.307 --> 00:19:51.477
Majesty,
as supreme head of the British

00:19:51.477 --> 00:19:52.118
Empire."
 

00:19:52.118 --> 00:19:52.333
Okay.
 

00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:54.516
They've taken up arms,
they're marching to fight the

00:19:54.516 --> 00:19:56.491
British,
and the first thing they say in

00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:58.943
the first sentence of their
proclamation is we're not

00:19:58.943 --> 00:20:00.358
rebelling against the King.
 

00:20:00.358 --> 00:20:02.196
That--When I read this I
thought, wow,

00:20:02.196 --> 00:20:04.979
that's--And I've been saying
over and over again in class

00:20:04.979 --> 00:20:07.808
it's--that all of these things
are mixed in together.

00:20:07.808 --> 00:20:09.993
People are upset,
they're angry at what's going

00:20:09.993 --> 00:20:11.088
on,
they're angry at British

00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:12.440
policy, and they're loyal to the
King,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.710
and they're thinking about
independence,

00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:15.028
but they're unsure about
independence,

00:20:15.028 --> 00:20:16.430
and they're still linked to
England.

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.553
And in a way,
that statement is a great

00:20:18.553 --> 00:20:21.220
example of that;
guys who are holding guns and

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.061
about to march to fight,
are being sure to state that

00:20:24.061 --> 00:20:26.959
they are not rebelling against
His Majesty as supreme head of

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:29.480
the British empire--
or, they don't want to be

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.470
accused of "opposition to
his legal authority,

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.365
and shall on every occasion
manifest to the world by our

00:20:35.365 --> 00:20:37.838
conduct this to be our fixed
principle."

00:20:37.838 --> 00:20:39.470
So they're not rebelling
against the King.

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:41.538
Instead they said that they
were, quote,

00:20:41.538 --> 00:20:43.390
"Driven to the last
necessity,

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.321
and obliged to have recourse to
arms in defense of our lives and

00:20:46.321 --> 00:20:47.160
liberties."
 

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.856
So they're saying,
'We're not rebels who are out

00:20:50.856 --> 00:20:53.058
to rebel against the King.
 

00:20:53.058 --> 00:20:54.836
We're actually--We've been
driven to this by what's going

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:56.548
on in Massachusetts and we're
protecting ourselves,

00:20:56.548 --> 00:20:59.529
but this is a defensive act and
not an aggressive act.'

00:20:59.529 --> 00:21:02.808
And then when you read a little
further on in the statement,

00:21:02.808 --> 00:21:04.798
after all of this sort of
noble, lofty sentiment,

00:21:04.798 --> 00:21:07.750
they then promise each other
they're not going to get drunk

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.818
or gamble or swear.
 

00:21:08.818 --> 00:21:10.868
[laughs]
It's down to practicalities.

00:21:10.868 --> 00:21:13.178
Now that we've declared our
purpose to the world,

00:21:13.178 --> 00:21:14.140
no heavy drinking.
 

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:14.593
Okay.
 

00:21:14.593 --> 00:21:17.038
The next day,
April 22,1775,

00:21:17.038 --> 00:21:23.019
classes at Yale were suspended
and a lot of students went home.

00:21:23.019 --> 00:21:26.038
Some, a few,
actually, went off to fight.

00:21:26.038 --> 00:21:30.406
So you can kind of see the way
that the wind is blowing in New

00:21:30.406 --> 00:21:30.980
Haven.
 

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.748
You can imagine,
given these sorts of events

00:21:33.748 --> 00:21:37.481
potentially how much fun it
would have been to be a college

00:21:37.481 --> 00:21:41.410
student with Loyalist leanings
at this particular moment.

00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:44.798
It would not have been very
fun--and sure enough in 1775

00:21:44.798 --> 00:21:46.338
there was that student.
 

00:21:46.338 --> 00:21:48.140
I discovered that student this
morning.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.885
There was a--I don't know if
he's the only one,

00:21:49.885 --> 00:21:51.328
but he's the guy who got in
trouble.

00:21:51.328 --> 00:21:55.958
There was one college student
here at Yale who was a declared

00:21:55.958 --> 00:21:57.269
Loyalist, 1775.
 

00:21:57.269 --> 00:22:00.210
He did not make other Yale
students very happy.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.068
He must have been loud about
being a Loyalist.

00:22:02.068 --> 00:22:04.801
Otherwise don't know how it
would have been so obvious to

00:22:04.801 --> 00:22:08.423
everyone that he was a Loyalist,
but the--a large chunk of the

00:22:08.423 --> 00:22:12.186
Yale student body decided to
have a meeting to debate what

00:22:12.186 --> 00:22:14.630
should be done about this
student.

00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.855
Okay.
 

00:22:14.855 --> 00:22:17.558
Obviously, things are not going
to go well for the student.

00:22:17.558 --> 00:22:19.920
'What should we do about this
student?'

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.930
They decide that they are going
to formally denounce him as--

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.837
publicly, as,
quote, "an enemy to his

00:22:24.837 --> 00:22:27.565
country"--
and that no one will be allowed

00:22:27.565 --> 00:22:30.250
to socialize with this student
ever again.

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:30.528
Okay.
 

00:22:30.528 --> 00:22:33.160
They've just ostracized
this--Can you imagine?

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:33.484
Sorry.
 

00:22:33.484 --> 00:22:36.355
'You've just been entirely
ostracized from every other

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.144
person at Yale University
[laughs]

00:22:38.144 --> 00:22:40.420
because we don't like your
politics.'

00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.045
So when I first found this this
morning, I was like:

00:22:43.045 --> 00:22:45.259
oh, poor guy,
and I couldn't figure out what

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:47.730
happened next and I just felt
sorry for him.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.627
Then I found a little bit more
about him and I felt a little

00:22:50.627 --> 00:22:52.788
less sorry for him because he
took action.

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:54.500
Apparently, he was from New
Haven,

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.529
this particular Loyalist
student, so learning that he had

00:22:57.529 --> 00:23:00.288
been ostracized by all of the
Yale student body,

00:23:00.288 --> 00:23:03.376
he went home and got some of
his townie friends to go back to

00:23:03.376 --> 00:23:05.950
Yale and beat up some Yale
students [laughter]--

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:08.558
which they did.
 

00:23:08.558 --> 00:23:11.660
And then the Yale students got
really mad at this apparently,

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.016
and armed themselves with clubs
and were going to go attack

00:23:15.016 --> 00:23:17.390
these townies when the Yale
president,

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.608
Naphtali Daggett, intervened.
 

00:23:19.608 --> 00:23:21.452
It was like:
'okay, we're done with the war

00:23:21.452 --> 00:23:22.900
now'--[laughter]
like, 'nice idea,

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.910
done with the war.'
 

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:26.549
So the fighting stopped and
eventually--I don't know

00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:29.863
when--the Loyalist withdrew from
Yale--so, you can't blame him at

00:23:29.863 --> 00:23:30.640
this point.
 

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:30.955
Okay.
 

00:23:30.955 --> 00:23:34.505
So we have people in New Haven
forming military units and

00:23:34.505 --> 00:23:36.088
marching off to fight.
 

00:23:36.088 --> 00:23:41.160
We have students ostracizing
that one lone Loyalist student.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.263
Not long after this,
Yale students organized their

00:23:44.263 --> 00:23:47.558
own military company and
actually began training,

00:23:47.558 --> 00:23:50.990
and not long after that the New
Haven town meeting voted,

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.960
and here's what they declared:
Quote,

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.920
"That the Governor be
desired to permit one hundred

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.040
stands of arms to be lodged in
the library for the use of a

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.710
company in Yale College ...
 

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:04.596
That should a company in
college be formed and accoutred,

00:24:04.596 --> 00:24:07.328
they draw half a pound of
powder to each man."

00:24:07.328 --> 00:24:07.640
Okay.
 

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.496
Yale students have just started
militarily drilling and the New

00:24:11.496 --> 00:24:15.598
Haven town meeting has voted to
store arms in the Yale library;

00:24:15.598 --> 00:24:18.634
in case the students actually
get it together and form an

00:24:18.634 --> 00:24:21.608
organized unit,
they'll have arms stored in the

00:24:21.608 --> 00:24:24.900
Yale library ready in case
fighting has to happen.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.935
Which again is a really
dramatic kind of a decision to

00:24:28.935 --> 00:24:29.470
make.
 

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.538
It's stated in a very plain way
in the document that I found,

00:24:32.538 --> 00:24:34.740
but that's a dramatic kind of a
decision.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.846
So again, you can see even just
in that example how some of

00:24:38.846 --> 00:24:42.952
these really general ideas I've
been talking about over the

00:24:42.952 --> 00:24:45.618
course of many,
many lectures--building

00:24:45.618 --> 00:24:47.278
resentments,
shared fears,

00:24:47.278 --> 00:24:52.202
continued loyalty to the King--
are playing out here on a small

00:24:52.202 --> 00:24:55.088
scale in New Haven in real life.
 

00:24:55.088 --> 00:24:58.948
Now the Yale military unit
apparently had its main moment

00:24:58.948 --> 00:25:02.644
of glory that same year in 1775,
when George Washington,

00:25:02.644 --> 00:25:05.547
who was now the newly named
Commander-in-Chief of the

00:25:05.547 --> 00:25:08.212
Continental Army,
actually passed through New

00:25:08.212 --> 00:25:11.256
Haven on his way to join the
Continental Army outside of

00:25:11.256 --> 00:25:11.808
Boston.
 

00:25:11.808 --> 00:25:14.342
And I'll be talking about
George Washington in the next

00:25:14.342 --> 00:25:16.921
lecture so I'm feeling very
fancy once again that I have

00:25:16.921 --> 00:25:19.594
magically somehow seemed as
though this lecture was really

00:25:19.594 --> 00:25:20.720
planned all along.
 

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.134
But apparently,
Connecticut newspapers noted

00:25:23.134 --> 00:25:25.269
that people from New Haven went
out;

00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:27.305
they wanted to see Washington;
they wanted to see what was

00:25:27.305 --> 00:25:29.297
going on;
they wanted to watch the Yale

00:25:29.297 --> 00:25:31.891
students do a drill,
which they did apparently--a

00:25:31.891 --> 00:25:34.808
formal drill in front of
Washington and his escort.

00:25:34.808 --> 00:25:37.067
Noah Webster,
dictionary Webster,

00:25:37.067 --> 00:25:41.017
was a Yale freshman that year,
and in later years he told

00:25:41.017 --> 00:25:43.910
people that he remembered that
event;

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.890
he remembered Washington
watching the drilling students;

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.362
he remembered that the body of
the--the military body of

00:25:51.362 --> 00:25:54.140
students, escorted Washington
out of town.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:56.666
And Webster said that he
himself played some kind of

00:25:56.666 --> 00:25:59.442
music to accompany the marching
of the Yale students with

00:25:59.442 --> 00:26:02.541
Washington out of town--
but he remembered that a long

00:26:02.541 --> 00:26:05.788
time later as sort of a
memorable moment from the war.

00:26:05.788 --> 00:26:11.490
Now in the interest of time,
I'm going to leap to 1777,

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:14.961
because in 1777 warfare now is
unfolding throughout the

00:26:14.961 --> 00:26:18.691
northern states and some people
then began to conclude that

00:26:18.691 --> 00:26:22.420
actually staying in New Haven
and studying at Yale might be

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:25.250
just too dangerous for Yale
students--

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.088
because New Haven was an
exposed port,

00:26:27.088 --> 00:26:28.970
which we're going to see in
about five minutes.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.160
It is an exposed port.
 

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.019
So the Yale authorities sent
students out to different towns.

00:26:34.019 --> 00:26:35.190
They didn't close Yale.
 

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.108
They just said, 'Okay.
 

00:26:36.108 --> 00:26:38.325
We're going to send students to
random places in Connecticut

00:26:38.325 --> 00:26:40.390
where they will be safer than
they are in New Haven.'

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:44.009
So freshmen went to Farmington,
sophomores and juniors went to

00:26:44.009 --> 00:26:46.858
Glastonbury, and seniors went to
Wethersfield.

00:26:46.858 --> 00:26:49.546
I cannot tell you why those
particular places seemed like

00:26:49.546 --> 00:26:52.416
logical places,
but you and your class were

00:26:52.416 --> 00:26:56.058
sent to a random place to
continue your studies.

00:26:56.058 --> 00:26:58.256
On their way out,
Yale officials asked the town

00:26:58.256 --> 00:27:01.358
to please protect the abandoned
college buildings from troops--

00:27:01.358 --> 00:27:04.705
American or British--troops,
and some library books were

00:27:04.705 --> 00:27:08.598
moved inland to protect them in
case troops came to New Haven.

00:27:08.598 --> 00:27:11.164
So again, people are feeling
there's a potential real threat

00:27:11.164 --> 00:27:11.470
here.
 

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:16.058
Yale eventually did come back
into session in New Haven,

00:27:16.058 --> 00:27:18.531
not without serious
problems--and again you're going

00:27:18.531 --> 00:27:21.296
to see the playing out here of
something I've talked about

00:27:21.296 --> 00:27:21.828
before.
 

00:27:21.828 --> 00:27:24.259
I've talked before about the
problems of supplying the army.

00:27:24.259 --> 00:27:25.348
It was hard to get food.
 

00:27:25.348 --> 00:27:28.238
People weren't sort of giving
up food and supplies to the

00:27:28.238 --> 00:27:28.598
army.
 

00:27:28.598 --> 00:27:32.875
Apparently, they--it was really
hard for people to get food and

00:27:32.875 --> 00:27:35.519
supplies into Yale too,
that people just

00:27:35.519 --> 00:27:38.605
weren't--whatever sources of
supplies had been serving Yale

00:27:38.605 --> 00:27:41.690
in the past were no longer doing
that in a time of war.

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:46.221
So in 1778, Yale sent out the
following notice to parents of

00:27:46.221 --> 00:27:47.450
Yale students.
 

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.856
September 30,1778:
"The steward of Yale

00:27:49.856 --> 00:27:52.938
College hereby requests the
Parents and Guardians of the

00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:56.690
Students to assist in furnishing
a supply of Provisions"--

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.140
okay, 'parents,
would you please send food?

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:02.515
[laughs] We don't have a lot;
we really need

00:28:02.515 --> 00:28:05.877
it'--'"without which it
will be very difficult if not

00:28:05.877 --> 00:28:09.890
impracticable for him to subsist
the Scholars the ensuing winter.

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.950
A generous and full Price shall
be allowed and paid either in

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:15.449
Money, or their Son's Quarter
Bills, shall be most

00:28:15.449 --> 00:28:16.470
agreeable."
 

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:17.500
Okay. 'Please send us food.
 

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.075
We don't have any,
and if you do we'll either pay

00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:23.079
you or we won't charge you
tuition for your son so please

00:28:23.079 --> 00:28:25.023
give us food'--
which again--Can you imagine

00:28:25.023 --> 00:28:26.279
being the parent who gets the
sorry,

00:28:26.279 --> 00:28:31.160
there's no food for your son;
[laughter] send some now?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.491
While you're sending the
homespun clothes,

00:28:33.491 --> 00:28:34.630
send the food too.
 

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.924
Okay.
 

00:28:34.924 --> 00:28:38.298
So the war is a real presence,
even on the college campus:

00:28:38.298 --> 00:28:40.355
drilling students,
fighting men,

00:28:40.355 --> 00:28:42.328
guns stored in the Yale
library,

00:28:42.328 --> 00:28:44.890
people having a hard time
getting food and supplies.

00:28:44.890 --> 00:28:48.641
1779 is when things become much
worse because that is the peak

00:28:48.641 --> 00:28:52.532
year of violence in New Haven;
that is the year when the

00:28:52.532 --> 00:28:54.608
British invaded New Haven.
 

00:28:54.608 --> 00:28:57.186
And Ezra Stiles,
who was President of Yale at

00:28:57.186 --> 00:29:00.065
the time,
noted in his diary the events

00:29:00.065 --> 00:29:03.087
as they unfolded--
and again, it's really

00:29:03.087 --> 00:29:05.848
interesting to see his diary
entries.

00:29:05.848 --> 00:29:08.328
He later wrote another account
that had full sentences,

00:29:08.328 --> 00:29:10.200
but to me what was more
interesting--

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.088
and I'll read some of them
here--were some of his diary

00:29:12.088 --> 00:29:13.630
entries because they're really
immediate,

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.936
and he's kind of recording his
reaction to events as they're

00:29:16.936 --> 00:29:17.608
happening.
 

00:29:17.608 --> 00:29:20.858
So on July 4,1779,
he says he heard news that

00:29:20.858 --> 00:29:25.067
there was a British fleet of
ships that had been seen near

00:29:25.067 --> 00:29:28.281
Bridgeport,
and supposedly rumor said it

00:29:28.281 --> 00:29:30.170
was heading to New Haven.
 

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:33.521
So again, being the responsible
president of Yale,

00:29:33.521 --> 00:29:35.779
he asks for militia to be sent.
 

00:29:35.779 --> 00:29:38.118
In case this is actually true,
they're going to need some real

00:29:38.118 --> 00:29:40.230
soldiers,
but he writes in his diary:

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.779
"Would not believe the
enemy intended landing."

00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:44.007
Okay.
 

00:29:44.007 --> 00:29:46.869
He hears the rumor and he takes
action but he actually literally

00:29:46.869 --> 00:29:49.597
cannot believe that the British
are actually going to get off

00:29:49.597 --> 00:29:50.779
the ships and attack.
 

00:29:50.779 --> 00:29:53.538
That can't be real;
can't be really happening.

00:29:53.538 --> 00:29:55.785
The next day,
July 5, Stiles,

00:29:55.785 --> 00:29:59.234
using a telescope,
says that he "saw the

00:29:59.234 --> 00:30:03.036
ships distinctly from the
steeple of College Chapel"

00:30:03.036 --> 00:30:04.150
and,
he continues,

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.859
"Began to remove all
property....

00:30:05.859 --> 00:30:07.130
Militia meeting.
 

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.759
Tories calm.
 

00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:12.221
With telescope from the tower
or steeple clearly saw the boats

00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:15.117
putting off from the ship and
landing a little after

00:30:15.117 --> 00:30:16.140
sunrise."
 

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:18.962
He sees the smaller boats going
off of these ships,

00:30:18.962 --> 00:30:21.108
with soldiers,
to land on the shore.

00:30:21.108 --> 00:30:23.828
"Immediately,
I sent off College records and

00:30:23.828 --> 00:30:24.509
papers ...
 

00:30:24.509 --> 00:30:25.934
and a bag of my own
things,"

00:30:25.934 --> 00:30:26.960
sent his family away.
 

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:29.182
The next day,
July 6, Stiles writes:

00:30:29.182 --> 00:30:30.578
"Enemy paraded.
 

00:30:30.578 --> 00:30:34.390
Sailors came on shore and took
their turn at plunder."

00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:37.231
I'm going to continue a couple
days here and then go back to

00:30:37.231 --> 00:30:39.397
the actual invasion,
just because the series of

00:30:39.397 --> 00:30:41.515
things he writes here are
interesting and they become

00:30:41.515 --> 00:30:43.634
weirdly personal,
which again reminds me that

00:30:43.634 --> 00:30:45.318
this is a real person's
experience.

00:30:45.318 --> 00:30:48.012
He says: July 7,11 o'clock
p.m., "enemy landed and

00:30:48.012 --> 00:30:49.210
burnt Fairfield."
 

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:53.019
July 8, "Removing my
furniture"--

00:30:53.019 --> 00:30:54.710
(he's now moving his furniture
out of Yale) --

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:57.702
"Removing my furniture
broke my Fahrenheit Thermometer

00:30:57.702 --> 00:30:59.558
which I have had since
1762."

00:30:59.558 --> 00:31:00.734
[laughter]
I was like: oh,

00:31:00.734 --> 00:31:03.227
okay, I feel sorry you're
moving your furniture and he

00:31:03.227 --> 00:31:04.450
broke his thermometer.
 

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:06.640
July 12, "the whole town
moving,"

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:09.617
and then July 23 this little,
tiny reminder that Yale is

00:31:09.617 --> 00:31:11.328
still an institution that
exists.

00:31:11.328 --> 00:31:14.548
July 23, Stiles spent the day
writing diplomas onto parchment.

00:31:14.548 --> 00:31:17.476
[laughs]
'Yeah, I know this is a little

00:31:17.476 --> 00:31:18.170
taxing.
 

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.413
I've still got students and
they still have to graduate so

00:31:20.413 --> 00:31:22.577
I'm going to write out their
diplomas'--which I think is

00:31:22.577 --> 00:31:23.680
really kind of striking.
 

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.000
Okay.
 

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.991
Let's turn back for a minute to
look at precisely what happened

00:31:27.991 --> 00:31:30.308
as the British invaded New
Haven.

00:31:30.308 --> 00:31:34.365
Apparently, they decided to
attack the Connecticut shore to

00:31:34.365 --> 00:31:38.490
draw some of Washington's troops
away from White Plains,

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.756
New York, where I guess they
were, and that was I guess a

00:31:40.756 --> 00:31:42.734
strong position to hold,
so the British thought well,

00:31:42.734 --> 00:31:43.970
if they attack the Connecticut
shore,

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:47.249
they'll entice Washington to
send some of his troops to

00:31:47.249 --> 00:31:50.770
Connecticut and that way maybe
they can defeat them on both

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:51.440
fronts.
 

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.915
And New Haven ends up being the
first target in this plan,

00:31:54.915 --> 00:31:58.210
so on July 5 the British debark
in New Haven Harbor.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:00.720
They had about two thousand
soldiers.

00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.573
One part of the troops was
going to enter New Haven from

00:32:03.573 --> 00:32:06.530
East Haven and the other part
was going to enter from West

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:07.048
Haven.
 

00:32:07.048 --> 00:32:10.284
Stiles wrote in his diary,
"Perhaps one-third of the

00:32:10.284 --> 00:32:13.980
adult male inhabitants flew to
arms and went out to meet them.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.960
A quarter removed out of town
doing nothing,

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.028
the rest remained unmoved,
partly Tories,

00:32:20.028 --> 00:32:22.821
partly timid Whigs,"
and then he adds that some of

00:32:22.821 --> 00:32:26.028
the Tories armed themselves and
then went out to fight with the

00:32:26.028 --> 00:32:26.650
British.
 

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.653
That's a great example of how
our--I think our impulse is to

00:32:30.653 --> 00:32:34.317
say, 'Well, the people were
united in unity against the

00:32:34.317 --> 00:32:35.200
British.'
 

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.311
It's like--well,
no.

00:32:36.311 --> 00:32:39.710
The entire town wasn't a big
lump--a big lump of rebels.

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:41.558
It was people with different
ideas,

00:32:41.558 --> 00:32:43.670
and you just--Stiles in that
one little sentence--

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.720
He has people going to fight
with the British,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.890
people going to fight against
the British.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.747
He has people sort of not
knowing what to do and kind of

00:32:49.747 --> 00:32:51.537
just staying in town and then
people not wanting to do

00:32:51.537 --> 00:32:52.978
anything,
just wanted to get themselves

00:32:52.978 --> 00:32:55.087
out of there--
all sort of happening at the

00:32:55.087 --> 00:32:55.720
same time.
 

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.460
People are making decisions,
some pretty dramatic decisions,

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.618
and they're having to make them
spur of the moment,

00:33:01.618 --> 00:33:05.390
and you can see them in a lot
of cases here taking a side,

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:08.386
taking a formal side in a way
that could have pretty dire

00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:09.190
consequences.
 

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:13.356
Yale immediately was dismissed,
and some students immediately

00:33:13.356 --> 00:33:14.400
ran for home.
 

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.038
Supposedly, according to a
diary, one student,

00:33:18.038 --> 00:33:20.233
a sophomore,
instead of going home decided

00:33:20.233 --> 00:33:22.695
to go to a nearby town and read
Blackstone's

00:33:22.695 --> 00:33:23.818
Commentaries.
 

00:33:23.818 --> 00:33:25.819
Why that made sense I don't
know.

00:33:25.819 --> 00:33:27.098
'What, the British are coming?
 

00:33:27.098 --> 00:33:30.788
I think I'll go to Fairfield
and read Blackstone now.'

00:33:30.788 --> 00:33:32.256
[laughter]
And in later years,

00:33:32.256 --> 00:33:35.240
he said he so enjoyed himself
reading Blackstone during that

00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:38.630
period that he decided to become
a lawyer right there and then.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.895
Okay.
 

00:33:38.895 --> 00:33:41.663
It's this one lone little
reading calm student in the

00:33:41.663 --> 00:33:44.750
midst of not a lot of other
reading calm students from what

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:45.710
I could tell.
 

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.420
Unlike that little Blackstone
student,

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:52.250
a volunteer company of about
seventy Yale students--

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:55.240
which is roughly half of the
student body at that point--

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.548
formed to fight.
 

00:33:56.548 --> 00:33:58.920
They were led by Captain James
Hillhouse.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:03.058
He is indeed New Haven
Hillhouse.

00:34:03.058 --> 00:34:04.691
He was a Yale graduate of a few
years before,

00:34:04.691 --> 00:34:06.358
so he's not that much older
than these men.

00:34:06.358 --> 00:34:09.126
And a Yale senior,
who ends up being one of these

00:34:09.126 --> 00:34:11.893
fighting Yale students,
offers an account of what

00:34:11.893 --> 00:34:13.449
happened at this point.
 

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:17.422
He says--He notes that troops
landed in the south part of West

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:19.431
Haven,
"about five miles from the

00:34:19.431 --> 00:34:20.349
center of the town.
 

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:22.876
College was of course broken up
and the students,

00:34:22.876 --> 00:34:25.981
with many of the inhabitants,
prepared to flee on the morrow

00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:27.719
into the neighboring country.
 

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.882
To give more time for
preparation and especially for

00:34:29.882 --> 00:34:32.423
the removal of goods,
a volunteer company of about a

00:34:32.423 --> 00:34:35.382
hundred young men was formed,
not with the expectation of

00:34:35.382 --> 00:34:37.840
making any serious stand against
such a force,

00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.130
but simply of retarding or
diverting its march."

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:42.577
So these students formed;
they don't think they're going

00:34:42.577 --> 00:34:44.798
to beat the British,
but maybe they can delay them a

00:34:44.798 --> 00:34:45.409
little bit.
 

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:46.760
"In common with others of
the students,

00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:49.175
I was one of the number,
and I well remember the

00:34:49.175 --> 00:34:51.849
surprise we felt the next
morning (July 5) as we were

00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:54.369
marching over West Bridge
towards the enemy,

00:34:54.369 --> 00:34:56.976
to see Dr. Daggett,"
who is the former President of

00:34:56.976 --> 00:34:58.463
Yale,
Naphtali Daggett,

00:34:58.463 --> 00:35:00.670
who is now a professor of
divinity,

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:03.608
so he's a Yale professor,
"how surprised we were the

00:35:03.608 --> 00:35:05.750
next morning,
to see Dr. Daggett riding

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:09.358
furiously by us on his old black
mare with his long fowling piece

00:35:09.358 --> 00:35:11.389
in his hand ready for action.
 

00:35:11.389 --> 00:35:14.581
We knew the old gentleman had
studied the matter thoroughly

00:35:14.581 --> 00:35:17.773
and satisfied his own mind as to
the right and propriety of

00:35:17.773 --> 00:35:20.271
fighting it out,
but we were not quite prepared

00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:22.730
to see him come forth in so
gallant a style to carry his

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.250
principles into practice."
 

00:35:24.250 --> 00:35:27.259
So, they see this professor go
riding off with his gun,

00:35:27.259 --> 00:35:29.878
going to fight the British,
like: 'wow, [laughs]

00:35:29.878 --> 00:35:31.550
that's pretty impressive.'
 

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.407
And I think in the first
lecture I mentioned this,

00:35:33.407 --> 00:35:35.340
and said it was the President
of Yale riding out.

00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.733
Daggett had retired as
President, so for the sake of

00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:40.597
accuracy, he's now not President
but a professor riding off to

00:35:40.597 --> 00:35:42.239
fight the British with his gun.
 

00:35:42.239 --> 00:35:45.201
So now this student goes on:
"Giving him a hearty cheer

00:35:45.201 --> 00:35:47.115
as he passed,
we turned down towards West

00:35:47.115 --> 00:35:49.039
Haven at the foot of the Milford
Mills,

00:35:49.039 --> 00:35:51.639
while he, Daggett,
ascended a little to the west

00:35:51.639 --> 00:35:54.956
and took his station in a copse
of wood where he seemed to be

00:35:54.956 --> 00:35:58.275
reconnoitering the enemy like
one who was determined 'to bide

00:35:58.275 --> 00:35:59.159
his time.'
 

00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:01.797
As we passed on towards the
south we met an advanced guard

00:36:01.797 --> 00:36:04.070
of the British,
and taking our stand at a line

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:05.860
of fence,
we fired upon them several

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.822
times, and then chased them the
length of three or four fields

00:36:08.822 --> 00:36:10.940
as they retreated,
until we suddenly found

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.039
ourselves involved with the main
body"--

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:15.750
Okay, [laughter]
so it was--a couple of soldiers

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:18.692
were like: 'get them,
uh oh [laughter]--"and in

00:36:18.692 --> 00:36:20.480
danger of being surrounded.
 

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.469
It was now our turn to run,
and we did for our lives.

00:36:25.469 --> 00:36:27.380
Passing by Dr. Daggett
[laughs]

00:36:27.380 --> 00:36:31.077
in his station on the hill we
retreated rapidly across West

00:36:31.077 --> 00:36:33.351
Bridge,
which was instantly taken down

00:36:33.351 --> 00:36:36.206
by persons who stood ready for
the purpose to prevent the enemy

00:36:36.206 --> 00:36:38.280
from entering the town by that
road."

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:38.404
Okay.
 

00:36:38.404 --> 00:36:39.250
So that's where his account
ends.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.905
Now we're going to pick it up
with Daggett who offered his own

00:36:41.905 --> 00:36:43.559
account afterwards of what
happened.

00:36:43.559 --> 00:36:43.887
Okay.
 

00:36:43.887 --> 00:36:47.420
"On Monday morning,
the 5^(th) instant the town of

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.842
New Haven was justly alarmed,
with the threatening appearance

00:36:50.842 --> 00:36:52.349
of a speedy invasion from the
Enemy.

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:54.510
Numbers went out armed to
oppose them....

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:57.150
Having gone as far as I
supposed was sufficient,

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:00.576
I turned down the hill to gain
a little covert of bushes which

00:37:00.576 --> 00:37:03.061
I had in my eye;
but to my great surprise I saw

00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:04.880
the Enemy much nearer than I
expected,

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:07.248
their advance guards being a
little more than 20 rods

00:37:07.248 --> 00:37:09.681
distant,
with plain open ground between

00:37:09.681 --> 00:37:09.940
us.
 

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.934
They instantly fired upon me,
which they continued till I had

00:37:12.934 --> 00:37:15.331
run a dozen rods,
discharging not less than 15 or

00:37:15.331 --> 00:37:18.726
20 balls at me alone;
however thro' the preserving

00:37:18.726 --> 00:37:21.675
providence of God,
I escaped from them all unhurt,

00:37:21.675 --> 00:37:23.869
and gained the little covert at
which I aimed,

00:37:23.869 --> 00:37:25.250
which concealed me from their
view,

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:27.530
while I could plainly see them
thro' the weeds and bushes,

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:30.090
advancing towards me within 12
rods.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:33.744
I singled out one of them,
took aim and fired upon

00:37:33.744 --> 00:37:34.639
him."
 

00:37:34.639 --> 00:37:35.429
Okay. So he takes one shot.
 

00:37:35.429 --> 00:37:38.485
"I loaded my musket again,
but determined not to discharge

00:37:38.485 --> 00:37:40.654
it any more,
as I saw I could not escape

00:37:40.654 --> 00:37:43.221
from them [laughs]
and I determined to surrender

00:37:43.221 --> 00:37:44.860
myself as a prisoner."
 

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.793
So he's charged out with his
gun, he takes one shot,

00:37:47.793 --> 00:37:49.750
and he's like:
'what am I doing?

00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:52.474
[laughter]
I'm a guy with a gun and the

00:37:52.474 --> 00:37:53.550
British Army.
 

00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:54.719
What am I doing?'
 

00:37:54.719 --> 00:37:55.931
He's like: 'okay,
I'll surrender myself as a

00:37:55.931 --> 00:37:56.268
prisoner.'
 

00:37:56.268 --> 00:37:59.440
"I begged for Quarter and
that they would spare my life.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.110
They drew near to me,
I think two only in number,

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:03.869
one on my right hand,
the other on my left,

00:38:03.869 --> 00:38:06.489
the fury of infernals glowing
in their faces,

00:38:06.489 --> 00:38:09.445
they called me a damned old
Rebel and swore they would kill

00:38:09.445 --> 00:38:10.210
me instantly.
 

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:12.751
They demanded,
quote, 'What did you fire upon

00:38:12.751 --> 00:38:14.369
us for?'"
[laughter]

00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:15.929
Okay. I love the question.
 

00:38:15.929 --> 00:38:19.202
'Why are you shooting at us,
you old crazy man sitting in

00:38:19.202 --> 00:38:20.018
the bushes?'
 

00:38:20.018 --> 00:38:23.786
"I replied,
'because it is the exercise of

00:38:23.786 --> 00:38:27.554
war.'" [laughter]
That did not impress the

00:38:27.554 --> 00:38:29.329
British,
and apparently,

00:38:29.329 --> 00:38:32.030
they actually--they didn't
treat him very well so they--

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:34.726
one of them pretended to stab
at him with his bayonet and

00:38:34.726 --> 00:38:36.510
actually stabbed him a little
bit,

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:38.226
and some of them sort of
[laughter]

00:38:38.226 --> 00:38:40.766
hit him on the head,
and there's a long account here

00:38:40.766 --> 00:38:43.210
which I don't have time to read
in which he talks about:

00:38:43.210 --> 00:38:45.831
'this guy hit me in the head
and that guy hit me on the shin

00:38:45.831 --> 00:38:48.409
and then some guy hit me with
the barrel of his gun.'

00:38:48.409 --> 00:38:51.204
And he actually--he ends up
being forced to march at the

00:38:51.204 --> 00:38:53.440
head of the British troops back
to New Haven,

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.659
from wherever he is.
 

00:38:54.659 --> 00:38:56.965
And he says I think in his
account, 'I finally--I saw the

00:38:56.965 --> 00:38:59.518
New Haven green and I was so
happy I was back in New Haven.'

00:38:59.518 --> 00:39:02.184
But I think he--Oh,
and also I should say they

00:39:02.184 --> 00:39:04.460
stole his shoes,
his knee buckles,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.903
his pocket handkerchief,
and a little,

00:39:06.903 --> 00:39:09.327
old tobacco box,
so they also just stripped him

00:39:09.327 --> 00:39:11.690
of whatever he had,
but he actually I think was

00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:13.650
kind of badly hurt and he's sick
for a while.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:15.650
And then a couple years later
he died,

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:18.480
and people later said that
maybe he died because of

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:21.764
injuries sustained at that
moment after the crazy charge of

00:39:21.764 --> 00:39:23.704
one guy,
the noble professor going off

00:39:23.704 --> 00:39:24.619
to fight the British.
 

00:39:24.619 --> 00:39:25.007
Okay.
 

00:39:25.007 --> 00:39:29.577
So troops entered New Haven
proper a little after noon after

00:39:29.577 --> 00:39:33.530
one last skirmish where Whaley
and Dixwell meet.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.835
This was the last little
skirmish and then the British

00:39:35.835 --> 00:39:36.268
entered.
 

00:39:36.268 --> 00:39:39.170
They entered New Haven and
immediately began to plunder

00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:42.338
Loyalist and Rebel houses alike,
breaking windows and doors,

00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:43.789
carrying off valuables.
 

00:39:43.789 --> 00:39:46.489
As Stiles described it,
"Plunder,

00:39:46.489 --> 00:39:48.942
Rape, Murder,
Bayoneting, Indelicacies toward

00:39:48.942 --> 00:39:50.996
the Sex"--
okay, women were not being

00:39:50.996 --> 00:39:53.402
treated respectfully --
"Insolence and Abuse and

00:39:53.402 --> 00:39:55.690
Insult toward the Inhabitants in
general."

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.713
One woman later recalled that a
British soldier in town cut off

00:39:58.713 --> 00:40:01.199
her necklace to keep,
and stole her shoe buckles.

00:40:01.199 --> 00:40:04.157
Someone who lived on State
Street said he was sitting in

00:40:04.157 --> 00:40:06.739
his door on State Street as the
British came,

00:40:06.739 --> 00:40:10.047
and he saw a British officer
come riding down Elm Street and

00:40:10.047 --> 00:40:12.179
turn up State Street towards
Grove,

00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:15.650
and then he saw someone he knew
from East Haven ride over,

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.871
holding a musket which he
leveled and fired at the British

00:40:17.871 --> 00:40:19.737
officer,
who fell off his horse and sort

00:40:19.737 --> 00:40:22.567
of crawled into someone's garden
at which point the East Haven

00:40:22.567 --> 00:40:24.840
guy grabbed the officer's horse
and rode away.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.083
'So [laughter]
I shot me someone from the

00:40:27.083 --> 00:40:29.269
British Army,
and I got a horse too.'

00:40:29.269 --> 00:40:31.750
Some people fled town.
 

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:35.405
One man who was stuck in town
with his wife because she was

00:40:35.405 --> 00:40:38.121
too ill to run,
saw British officers enter town

00:40:38.121 --> 00:40:41.231
and apparently went up to one
and asked for protection and the

00:40:41.231 --> 00:40:43.269
officer asked,
'Are you a friend to King

00:40:43.269 --> 00:40:46.150
George?,' and the man said,
'I am,'--so his house was not

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.052
attacked,
but apparently he was not a

00:40:48.052 --> 00:40:50.047
friend to King George,
he was not a Tory,

00:40:50.047 --> 00:40:51.768
so for there,
after in the town he was

00:40:51.768 --> 00:40:54.190
someone who was highly unpopular
because he had--

00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.998
I suppose in a sense--sold
himself out to protect his

00:40:56.998 --> 00:40:59.318
house;
again a sort of decision of the

00:40:59.318 --> 00:41:02.730
moment that makes sense but that
then had implications.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:05.358
Some New Haven Loyalists
actually fled with the British

00:41:05.358 --> 00:41:07.938
Army, which as they left,
actually, they left a lot of

00:41:07.938 --> 00:41:09.400
destruction in their wake.
 

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:09.827
Okay.
 

00:41:09.827 --> 00:41:12.219
So what have we seen today?
 

00:41:12.219 --> 00:41:16.108
We've definitely seen how ideas
and events happening in places

00:41:16.108 --> 00:41:19.742
pretty far removed from New
Haven are distilling their way

00:41:19.742 --> 00:41:22.157
down,
right here--Yale College,

00:41:22.157 --> 00:41:24.751
New Haven,
Connecticut--and really driving

00:41:24.751 --> 00:41:27.918
people to take action,
sometimes pretty dramatic

00:41:27.918 --> 00:41:28.500
action.
 

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.606
We've seen average citizens,
average people from New Haven,

00:41:32.606 --> 00:41:35.012
stirred to act:
merchants, lawyers,

00:41:35.012 --> 00:41:37.420
sailors, shoemakers,
students.

00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:40.755
We've seen how the coming of
war revealed all kinds of

00:41:40.755 --> 00:41:43.724
divisions among local people,
as well as unity,

00:41:43.724 --> 00:41:46.760
because people did have to make
choices of all kinds.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.262
So basically,
we've seen in this one little

00:41:49.262 --> 00:41:52.956
real-life example how the coming
of the Revolution and then the

00:41:52.956 --> 00:41:56.530
carrying out of the Revolution
drove average people to become

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.690
politically active and also
militarily active,

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.259
to think through their options,
to decide what they really

00:42:02.259 --> 00:42:04.514
believed,
and then in many cases to take

00:42:04.514 --> 00:42:05.030
a stand.
 

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.489
So Professor Daggett--The
student says,

00:42:07.489 --> 00:42:09.380
'We know he'd been thinking
about it and he had been

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.643
thinking about what he wanted to
do and he had decided that if

00:42:11.643 --> 00:42:13.239
pushed,
he would fight.'

00:42:13.239 --> 00:42:14.851
The student is kind of
surprised he's actually heading

00:42:14.851 --> 00:42:16.525
out with a gun,
but again--the student knows

00:42:16.525 --> 00:42:18.695
that Daggett was thinking
through what his actions were

00:42:18.695 --> 00:42:20.731
going to be,
and then he watches him take

00:42:20.731 --> 00:42:22.701
action,
like the Loyalists who left New

00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:26.260
Haven with the British;
again a really dramatic action.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.697
So in just this little sort of
case study of New Haven and

00:42:29.697 --> 00:42:32.300
Yale,
you can see how citizenship and

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.380
leadership came to have
different meanings,

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:38.666
how people were understanding
what they were supposed to be

00:42:38.666 --> 00:42:42.295
doing as citizens in a different
way as they lived the experience

00:42:42.295 --> 00:42:43.940
of fighting a Revolution.
 

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:45.539
Okay. I ended that on time.
 

00:42:45.539 --> 00:42:48.054
I even read my--I'm so
impressed with

00:42:48.054 --> 00:42:51.409
myself--[laughs/laughter]
the instant lecture.

00:42:51.409 --> 00:42:51.626
Okay.
 

00:42:51.626 --> 00:42:54.139
And I ended two minutes early,
so you have time to get your

00:42:54.139 --> 00:42:54.659
midterms.
 

00:42:54.659 --> 00:42:59.130
Have a wonderful spring break,
and I will see you after.

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:05.000

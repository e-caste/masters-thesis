00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.167
PAUL FREEDMAN: I've
put these names on

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:03.967
the board because today we're

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:06.933
talking about the so-called
Carolingian Renaissance, the

00:00:06.933 --> 00:00:10.033
revival of learning, under
Charlemagne and his

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.767
successors.

00:00:11.767 --> 00:00:15.333
But the figures of this
Renaissance, the intellectuals

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:19.267
of Charlemagne's court, of the
court of Louis the Pious, the

00:00:19.267 --> 00:00:23.500
court of Charles the Bald
are not household names.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.100
And I just want to give you a
sample-- and it is no more

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.267
than a sample--

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:28.767
of these men.

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:31.367
And I'm afraid they
all were men.

00:00:31.367 --> 00:00:38.600
And most of them monks or
other kinds of clerics.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.000
And what I want to do today is
remind you for the first, to

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.833
start, we said last time that
Charlemagne's rule was based

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:50.667
on a combination of traditional
war leadership,

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:55.400
similar to that Merovingians;
an alliance with the Church,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.333
similar to the Merovingians, but
much closer - Much closer

00:00:59.333 --> 00:01:05.767
in the sense of seeing the
legitimation of rule, up to

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:11.133
the point of emperor, as a
product of what later would be

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.033
called "sacred monarchy".

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:15.633
In other words, that the
kingship was not just

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:19.767
rulership over the populace,
or over warriors--

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:23.800
it was that-- but it was
also a responsibility--

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.733
a ministry is the word
that's used--

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:31.033
to see to the salvation
of the public good.

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:34.500
Not just the secular benefit
of the public good, as in a

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.100
modern state, but to the
salvation of the people that

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.833
God would hold the emperor,
the king,

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:42.900
responsible for this.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.567
And then the third element was
to revive the Roman Empire.

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:52.833
And not just as a political
entity, but the Roman Empire

00:01:52.833 --> 00:01:55.167
as a state.

00:01:55.167 --> 00:02:00.167
As a form of rulership for
the benefit of a diverse

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:03.333
population, not just one nation,
like the Franks or the

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:07.867
Lombards or the Saxons, but
of a kind of imperial

00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:09.133
confederation.

00:02:11.267 --> 00:02:18.133
The Carolingian Renaissance is
a planned one, unlike the

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.433
regular old Italian Renaissance,
which is a

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.767
spontaneous revival of learning
in several different

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:26.833
cities on the parts
of intellectuals.

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:30.167
The Italian Renaissance, like
most revivals of learning,

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:33.733
might have been patronized by
secular rulers, but its

00:02:33.733 --> 00:02:37.400
impetus was not the state.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:46.533
In this case, however, we have
a program of reviving Latin,

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:55.633
reviving the classical
literature and texts, teaching

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.500
these subjects.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.067
And all of this not in aid of
what we would call a purely

00:03:02.067 --> 00:03:07.200
educational program, but to help
the state and to help its

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.300
mission, which as we've just
said, is both a Christian and

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.600
a Roman one.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.767
The revival of letters was
intended, then, to restore and

00:03:18.767 --> 00:03:23.067
deepen the piety of the
population, the understanding

00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:26.633
of Christianity, the restoration
of the Church as

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:30.900
an intellectual force, the
preservation of learning from

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.067
both Roman secular and
religious texts.

00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:38.933
So that Charlemagne's cultural
program is the culmination of

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:44.067
a longer period of trying to
save something from the

00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:47.833
wreckage of classical
civilization.

00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:51.533
And thus, as a Christian ruler
and as a Roman emperor,

00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:55.133
Charlemagne surrounded himself
with these and other

00:03:55.133 --> 00:04:00.467
intellectuals, monks,
and scholars.

00:04:00.467 --> 00:04:03.767
In order to understand this
mission, however, beyond just

00:04:03.767 --> 00:04:08.633
saying oh, Christianity or
classical culture, we have to

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:11.867
go back to some topics we
touched on very lightly when

00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:14.333
we were talking about
monasticism.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:17.733
And that have cropped
up now and then.

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:20.833
So I want to start out with the
preservation of learning

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:24.333
up to the point that Charlemagne
really starts

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:30.167
putting together this program
around 780 AD.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:34.200
You'll remember, and you will
have seen from Augustine's

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.767
Confessions, among other things,
that the ideal of

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:45.167
Roman culture at the time of
the Empire was cultivated

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:48.567
leisure on the part of wealthy,

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:50.967
well-educated lay people.

00:04:50.967 --> 00:04:54.100
That is to say, even after
Constantine's conversion, the

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.100
intellectuals of the Empire
tended to be not clergy, but

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.767
wealthy people who could afford
the leisure, the time,

00:05:03.767 --> 00:05:08.667
and the expense of procuring
books, and of discussing them.

00:05:08.667 --> 00:05:13.333
These were the people who
represented the continuation

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:16.967
of the literary and
philosophical traditions of

00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:20.700
classical Greece and Rome.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.233
And this also had a practical
benefit just as, rather in a

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:27.067
different way, it does now.

00:05:27.067 --> 00:05:31.000
In order to enter Roman
governmental service, which

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.833
was the most successful career
path of the time of Saint

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:38.033
Augustine and had been for some
centuries, you needed to

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:43.400
have an education of a certain
rather rarefied higher sort.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.933
And this is not unique to the
Roman Empire, it was true of

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:49.267
Imperial China, most
obviously.

00:05:49.267 --> 00:05:54.000
In China, you had to pass a
very tough exam, a very

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.200
selective exam, in order to be a
part of the highest level of

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:59.333
the imperial service.

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:02.767
And the exam was not a political
science exam or a

00:06:02.767 --> 00:06:04.733
business decisions
kind of exam.

00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:10.300
It wasn't like you have a
certain kind of budget and

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.667
you've got to allocate
resources.

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:15.367
It's not a problem set.

00:06:15.367 --> 00:06:17.367
It was poetry.

00:06:17.367 --> 00:06:21.900
It was ancient culture.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.900
And the same thing is true of
the British Empire in the

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.000
nineteenth century.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.267
In order to enter its highest
levels, you needed to know

00:06:30.267 --> 00:06:33.600
Greek and Latin.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:39.633
Not because you were going to
use them governing some colony

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:42.000
in Southeast Asia,
for example.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.033
But because that was what made
you an educated person.

00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:51.633
So the centers of learning in
the ancient world included

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:57.867
Athens, the Platonic and
Athenian academies; Pergamum

00:06:57.867 --> 00:07:02.167
in Asia Minor, the name of which
city gave its name to

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:06.933
parchment; Alexandria, which
had an entity called the

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:10.667
Museum, which was not what we
now call a museum, but rather

00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:15.867
kind of library and research
center; Constantinople, later.

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:21.600
Alexandria is the most famous
because it had this

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.167
magnificent library as part of
the museum, and the mystery of

00:07:25.167 --> 00:07:30.767
what happened to this library,
allegedly burned by the

00:07:30.767 --> 00:07:37.367
Muslims in the eighth century on
the grounds that you didn't

00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:40.267
need to know anything except
what's in the Koran.

00:07:40.267 --> 00:07:42.667
And this is not true.

00:07:42.667 --> 00:07:45.467
The library had disappeared long
before the eighth century

00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:49.733
and probably was the victim of
the kinds of disorders that

00:07:49.733 --> 00:07:52.200
began in the third century, when
we began the course, the

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.900
kind of disruptions of local
society, opportunities for

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:57.867
plunder, neglect.

00:07:57.867 --> 00:08:02.600
And the Museum was actually
closed by the emperor

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:09.100
Caracalla in the
third century.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:15.833
So the major problem of the
Roman Empire in terms of the

00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:19.400
diminution of learning is not
the burning of Alexandria or

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.333
such dramatic events, it's a
much more gradual process.

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:26.533
And this gradual process
involved what we have at

00:08:26.533 --> 00:08:31.633
various times, using Wickham's
language, called "the radical

00:08:31.633 --> 00:08:34.600
simplification of material
culture".

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:39.200
Which means not only a lack of
imported goods, more primitive

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:46.933
accommodations, less trade and
commerce, but also much less

00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:50.233
in the way of books
and learning.

00:08:50.233 --> 00:08:56.633
This is also related to the
disappearance of lay literacy.

00:08:56.633 --> 00:09:02.033
The people who were capable of
reading and writing in Latin,

00:09:02.033 --> 00:09:06.033
as of, let's say, the
sixth century, are

00:09:06.033 --> 00:09:08.233
overwhelmingly clerics.

00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:11.933
And not all that many
of them, either.

00:09:11.933 --> 00:09:18.167
The last grand figures of Roman
classical culture are

00:09:18.167 --> 00:09:22.300
Boethius and Cassiodorus.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.633
And we've mentioned them
already, but they bear

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:28.700
[clarification: bear
repeating]--

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:35.933
Boethius, 480-524.

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:47.867
And Cassiodorus, 490-585.

00:09:47.867 --> 00:09:50.200
Cassiodorus was a monk.

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.767
And it is his accomplishment
to join monasticism to the

00:09:54.767 --> 00:09:56.200
preservation of learning.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.067
And he had a very long life
to do it as well.

00:09:59.067 --> 00:10:02.167
Reminding us that not everybody
just kicked off of

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:05.767
the age of thirty-five in the
pre-industrial world.

00:10:05.767 --> 00:10:08.100
Boethius didn't have a
particularly long life,

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.233
because he was executed by the
Ostrogothic king, Theodoric,

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:15.300
suspected of treason and
plotting with Byzantium.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.767
Boethius could still work in his
personal library in Rome,

00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:27.600
where the light filtered in
through alabaster windows--

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.100
the Beinecke Library idea--

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:37.367
Onto cupboards stacked with
Greek and Roman papyrus books.

00:10:37.367 --> 00:10:40.467
But Boethius was among the last
secular intellectuals in

00:10:40.467 --> 00:10:44.367
the west, and particularly one
of the last to know Greek as

00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:45.833
well as Latin.

00:10:45.833 --> 00:10:49.367
He conceived a project of
translating the great works of

00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:54.567
Greek philosophy into Latin,
which would have included all

00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:57.200
of Plato and Aristotle.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.867
But he was cut off by his
arrest, torture, and execution

00:11:02.867 --> 00:11:06.767
after just having done some
introductory textbooks and

00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:08.800
just a smattering of Plato
and Aristotle.

00:11:11.467 --> 00:11:16.367
After him and the Justinianic
invasion of Italy, Italy was

00:11:16.367 --> 00:11:17.200
devastated.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:23.333
And even though it will remain
a repository of manuscripts,

00:11:23.333 --> 00:11:29.033
its learning was preserved as
a guttering flame by monks

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:33.033
like Cassiodorus and, almost
accidentally, by the monks who

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:36.633
followed the rule of
Saint Benedict.

00:11:36.633 --> 00:11:40.667
Saint Benedict does, as you'll
recall, require reading.

00:11:40.667 --> 00:11:43.633
But it's usually during Lent
and it's a kind of penance.

00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:48.800
The contribution of
Cassiodorus is the

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.467
organization of a more

00:11:50.467 --> 00:11:53.533
library-like kind of monastery.

00:11:53.533 --> 00:11:58.267
And the notion that classical
culture is not just a

00:11:58.267 --> 00:12:03.400
collection of text about a
discredited religion, but

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.600
necessary for Christian
interpretation of the Bible

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.700
and Christian learning.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:15.500
At his monastery of Vivarium in
southern Italy, Cassiodorus

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:23.600
developed a notion of the
liberal arts as an aid to

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.267
religious truth.

00:12:25.267 --> 00:12:29.400
The liberal arts is not his
invention, but the notion of

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.400
the liberal arts culminating
in a program that has a

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.233
purpose in which classical
culture is fused with

00:12:37.233 --> 00:12:40.567
Christian culture
is his doing.

00:12:40.567 --> 00:12:43.867
He was not so much interested
in the aesthetic pleasure of

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:46.933
these classical texts
as in their use for

00:12:46.933 --> 00:12:49.733
interpreting the Bible.

00:12:49.733 --> 00:12:54.267
The Bible, according to his,
Augustine's, and virtually

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:58.033
everybody's understanding of the
time, is not a text that

00:12:58.033 --> 00:13:01.600
makes perfect sense in every
respect literally.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:07.300
It is the book of life that God
has set up for us, but it

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.533
requires interpretation.

00:13:11.467 --> 00:13:16.567
It is not just a literal text,
it is a figurative and

00:13:16.567 --> 00:13:18.100
prophetic one as well.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.633
And in order to get at what it
really means, what its real

00:13:22.633 --> 00:13:27.133
messages are, you have to know
things like mathematics,

00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:35.000
astronomy, geometry, even music,
and certainly grammar,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.300
rhetoric, and logic.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:40.433
These are the seven liberal
arts of Cassiodorus's

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:43.133
curriculum.

00:13:43.133 --> 00:13:46.567
They're arranged in
the three basic--

00:13:46.567 --> 00:13:48.900
the trivium, as it came
to be called.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:51.367
The three, not because of
trivial, although that's where

00:13:51.367 --> 00:13:54.033
the word comes from,
The trivium.

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:59.167
I-U-M. T-R-I-V-I-U-M. Logic,
grammar, rhetoric.

00:13:59.167 --> 00:14:02.700
Now, I'm in this sort of
Rick Perry moment.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.567
The quadrivium, there
are four of them.

00:14:05.567 --> 00:14:06.533
OK?

00:14:06.533 --> 00:14:09.800
Arithmetic, astronomy,
geometry, and music.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.100
OK.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.600
So I got all of them.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:15.400
The quadrivium are
the sciences.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.133
You don't think music
is a science?

00:14:18.133 --> 00:14:21.700
In the late Roman medieval
imagination, it was the

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.000
science of intervals and of
pleasing forms and of modes.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:35.333
The replication of this plan
of Cassiodorus is the

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:39.300
accomplishment of this period
in which classical learning

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.567
and its texts were endangered.

00:14:42.567 --> 00:14:46.033
The Benedictine monks
of Italy--

00:14:46.033 --> 00:14:46.733
question?

00:14:46.733 --> 00:14:47.400
Something I missed?

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.367
STUDENT: I'm sorry.

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:49.200
What was the four?

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.900
PROFESSOR: The
four-- the quadrivium.

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.733
Quad, Q-U-A-D-R-I-V-I-U-M.
Sorry, what were they?

00:14:54.733 --> 00:14:55.600
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.700
PROFESSOR:
Oh, you're putting

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:57.967
me on the spot again?

00:15:00.767 --> 00:15:02.433
Geometry--

00:15:02.433 --> 00:15:05.700
geometry, music, arithmetic,
and astronomy.

00:15:09.333 --> 00:15:12.200
Right?

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.567
This is the period in which the
Irish are critical to the

00:15:15.567 --> 00:15:17.033
preservation of learning.

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:19.500
There was a book that was
popular a few years ago called

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.933
How the Irish Saved
Civilization.

00:15:21.933 --> 00:15:24.967
Like many popular books, this
is a little bit reducing

00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:27.900
things to a kind of
easy formula.

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:33.400
But it is Irish as well as
Italian and very much English

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.100
monasticism, under the influence
of both Italy and

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.367
Ireland, that has a program of
establishing monasteries,

00:15:41.367 --> 00:15:45.200
correcting and preserving
Latin, which has become

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.000
increasingly distant from what
people actually speak.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.500
And of course, in Ireland, not
part of the Roman Empire, they

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:55.400
had no tradition of
speaking Latin.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.400
The monks had to learn Latin as
an artificial or completely

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.500
foreign language.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.067
And in a way, that made their
Latin better, because they

00:16:03.067 --> 00:16:07.700
didn't think that kind of
on-the-way-to-French or

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.667
on-the-way-to-Spanish language
that was being spoken in

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:15.600
general could be confused
with Latin.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:20.800
In the critical period, 550,
end of the Gothic wars in

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.467
Italy, devastation in Italy,
to 750, beginning of the

00:16:24.467 --> 00:16:31.900
Carolingian ascent, there are
only 264 books that survive.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:36.200
That is 264 manuscripts.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:42.033
And all but twenty-six of them
deal with religious subjects.

00:16:42.033 --> 00:16:46.433
Of this twenty-six of them,
eight deal with law, eight

00:16:46.433 --> 00:16:51.467
with medicine, six
with grammar.

00:16:51.467 --> 00:16:55.033
Now, one reason that very little
survives is that these

00:16:55.033 --> 00:16:58.433
were mostly written on
papyrus scrolls,

00:16:58.433 --> 00:17:00.500
which is not very durable.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.633
Though there is a change
underway from about 400 AD to

00:17:04.633 --> 00:17:07.967
writing on parchment, which
is very durable.

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.900
And accordingly, along with this
change to parchment is a

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:22.733
change from the scroll
to the codex.

00:17:22.733 --> 00:17:34.200
So the triumph of the codex
is roughly 400 AD to 2010.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.667
We're going back to the
scroll, actually.

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:40.767
We even use the word for the
process of going through a

00:17:40.767 --> 00:17:46.100
document on a computer
or a Kindle.

00:17:55.967 --> 00:17:58.000
How big are these libraries?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.100
How many texts do they have?

00:18:02.633 --> 00:18:06.633
The largest library before
Charlemagne's ascent would

00:18:06.633 --> 00:18:09.633
have been the two libraries
associated with the-- in the

00:18:09.633 --> 00:18:12.600
north of England.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:21.300
And perhaps one hundred
books, 120.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.200
But it's at this setting, the
England of Bede, the early

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.033
eighth century, that we start
to have the monasteries that

00:18:29.033 --> 00:18:34.067
really conform to our image of
monks diligently copying

00:18:34.067 --> 00:18:35.600
manuscripts.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.533
The invention of what's called
the monastic scriptorium, a

00:18:39.533 --> 00:18:41.333
place for writing.

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:59.033
So there are monks who not
only read, but copy other

00:18:59.033 --> 00:19:02.267
books, maybe borrowed from
other monasteries, too.

00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:10.167
This is a laborious process and
one that we can follow,

00:19:10.167 --> 00:19:14.900
because we tend to know where
our texts of classical

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:18.600
learning come from, and by
how slender a thread

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.500
they arrive for us.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.933
The monks would copy
these documents.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.333
They would be preserved
in the library.

00:19:36.333 --> 00:19:41.000
But again, these monasteries
close, are plundered.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.133
The wanderings of these
manuscripts then increase the

00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:51.167
fragility of what exists
and what we now.

00:19:51.167 --> 00:19:51.467
Yeah?

00:19:51.467 --> 00:19:54.633
STUDENT: How do monks in
Northumbria get a hold of

00:19:54.633 --> 00:19:57.800
texts that's mainly from
libraries and external...

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.067
PROFESSOR: The
question is how do these monks

00:20:00.067 --> 00:20:03.700
in far off Northeastern England
get a hold of the

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.367
classical texts?

00:20:05.367 --> 00:20:08.567
They're brought up with
the missionaries.

00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:13.767
There are evidence of constant
communication with Italy,

00:20:13.767 --> 00:20:17.000
which is probably the source
of most of them.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.633
And they'd learned very
quickly-- remember, I said

00:20:19.633 --> 00:20:23.500
that there is this magnificent
codex of the Bible that's now

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:27.767
in Florence, that was a gift of
the English to the Pope in

00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:29.000
the eighth century.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.833
So there is traffic in these
extremely precious objects.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.233
But it's very small scale and
very fragile, as I've said,

00:20:46.233 --> 00:20:47.667
until Charlemagne.

00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:52.000
What Charlemagne does is not so
much innovate or invent a

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.967
program, as make it into
something that's not just in

00:20:56.967 --> 00:21:01.900
artisanal enterprise dependent
on a few monks in a few

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.067
monasteries.

00:21:03.067 --> 00:21:08.200
And it's part of what we've said
is a campaign to salvage

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.467
classical learning.

00:21:14.267 --> 00:21:21.600
This is encapsulated in one
of Charlemagne's governing

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.100
instructions to his
administrative cadres.

00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:31.233
He says, "we are concerned to
restore with diligent zeal the

00:21:31.233 --> 00:21:36.400
workshops of knowledge, which,
through the negligence of our

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:40.833
ancestors, have been
well-nigh deserted.

00:21:40.833 --> 00:21:46.300
We invite others by our own
example as much as lies within

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:54.667
our power to learn to practice
the liberal arts."

00:21:54.667 --> 00:22:00.433
As Wickham points out, this
is an unusual period of

00:22:00.433 --> 00:22:04.000
intellectuals participating in,
and even to some extent,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
directing government.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.500
It's always necessary for
governments to have some

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.567
economists or foreign
policy specialists.

00:22:16.567 --> 00:22:20.267
But intellectuals in the sense
of promoting a program of

00:22:20.267 --> 00:22:22.667
liberal arts is unusual.

00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:27.633
Or intellectuals who are not
just decorators, ornamentors,

00:22:27.633 --> 00:22:30.567
people who do nice, illuminated
manuscripts, or

00:22:30.567 --> 00:22:36.700
beautiful fountains out of
silver with chirping birds.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:40.233
The court of Charlemagne
is a moment of intense

00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:42.333
intellectual effort.

00:22:42.333 --> 00:22:45.667
And Charlemagne and his
successors were rulers who

00:22:45.667 --> 00:22:50.867
gave tremendous power,
privileges, even wealth, to

00:22:50.867 --> 00:22:55.700
people who knew something about
classical learning.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.467
The purpose of this is to
standardize education in the

00:23:00.467 --> 00:23:06.933
Church and to make sure
that the Church ran in

00:23:06.933 --> 00:23:09.033
an effective manner.

00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:11.667
And also to make sure that
the government ran in

00:23:11.667 --> 00:23:13.367
an effective manner.

00:23:13.367 --> 00:23:18.333
By effective, I mean uniformity
and discipline.

00:23:18.333 --> 00:23:22.667
So that you could go into a
church in Barcelona, the

00:23:22.667 --> 00:23:29.233
southwestern corner of
Charlemagne's realm, or in

00:23:29.233 --> 00:23:35.233
Aachen at the court of
Charlemagne, or in Rome

00:23:35.233 --> 00:23:39.367
itself, and hear the same
kind of liturgy

00:23:39.367 --> 00:23:42.533
or ceremony or ritual.

00:23:42.533 --> 00:23:45.133
That from one corner the Empire
to the other, the

00:23:45.133 --> 00:23:49.167
church laws would be the same.

00:23:49.167 --> 00:23:54.500
That the discipline meted out
to misbehaving priests would

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.733
be the same.

00:23:56.733 --> 00:23:59.100
That preaching and missionary
work would be

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.400
coordinated and uniform.

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.500
Even that spelling and the shape
of the letters might be

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.067
standardized.

00:24:08.067 --> 00:24:12.400
It is to Charlemagne and these
intellectuals that we owe the

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.233
very beautiful way
that we write.

00:24:15.233 --> 00:24:22.233
As you can see, my minuscule
print is the product of a

00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:24.933
monastic education.

00:24:24.933 --> 00:24:26.767
These little letters, right?

00:24:26.767 --> 00:24:30.567
These minuscule letters
are Carolingian.

00:24:30.567 --> 00:24:33.533
This is how they write.

00:24:33.533 --> 00:24:38.533
In the Roman era, they tend to
write in a different fashion.

00:24:38.533 --> 00:24:44.067
And in the Merovingian court,
Visigothic courts, in a still

00:24:44.067 --> 00:24:46.067
different and quite difficult
to read-- at

00:24:46.067 --> 00:24:47.600
least for us now--

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:48.733
fashion.

00:24:48.733 --> 00:24:54.133
The spelling of Latin is
regularized at this time.

00:24:54.133 --> 00:25:01.600
The notion is that the people
would receive basic education.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.667
And of course, there's some
debate as to how wide a

00:25:05.667 --> 00:25:08.333
spectrum of the populace
this involved.

00:25:08.333 --> 00:25:12.467
How much education ordinary
people were to receive.

00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:16.167
But from the point of view of
the intellectuals fashioning

00:25:16.167 --> 00:25:19.500
this, what was really important
was that the clergy

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.100
receive a good Latin
education.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:27.533
The problem of clerical literacy
is a persistent

00:25:27.533 --> 00:25:29.400
problem of the Middle Ages.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:33.300
Clergy, who may know some
formula to recite, who don't

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.867
actually know how to read, or
who don't actually know what

00:25:36.867 --> 00:25:40.033
the Latin words mean.

00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:50.433
So this is a program not just
to save texts, but to use

00:25:50.433 --> 00:25:52.067
them, to apply them.

00:25:52.067 --> 00:25:56.933
And also to apply them to
a level below that of

00:25:56.933 --> 00:25:59.700
intellectuals sitting
around and

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.533
discussing the ancient world.

00:26:03.533 --> 00:26:08.000
At the highest level, monastic
centers collected and copied

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.033
Latin classical manuscripts.

00:26:14.567 --> 00:26:18.233
Collected, commented,
collated.

00:26:18.233 --> 00:26:22.367
This is not an intellectual
program that aims at

00:26:22.367 --> 00:26:26.967
entrepreneurship or
intellectuality in the sense

00:26:26.967 --> 00:26:28.633
of innovation.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.567
Wickham talks about Amalarius
of Metz, one of the people I

00:26:35.567 --> 00:26:36.900
didn't put on here.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:42.033
Amalarius, remember, is
condemned for certain

00:26:42.033 --> 00:26:45.300
liturgical innovations.

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:50.833
And he's astounded at being
accused of innovating.

00:26:50.833 --> 00:26:53.800
He acknowledges that this is not
his job, although he makes

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:59.033
it worse by saying that
he had found truth

00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:01.567
within his own spirit.

00:27:01.567 --> 00:27:05.200
Saying "I've found truth within
my own spirit" in 840

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.000
AD is not a proper answer,
because that makes it sound as

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.800
if your spirit determines
what truth is.

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:17.067
Whereas truth is determined by
a much longer, biblical,

00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:18.267
classical tradition.

00:27:18.267 --> 00:27:20.100
And that's what orthodoxy is.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:23.633
So he sort of had to accept
his not incredibly severe

00:27:23.633 --> 00:27:25.133
punishment, but punishment
nonetheless.

00:27:31.367 --> 00:27:35.267
The Carolingian Renaissance was
organized by a group of

00:27:35.267 --> 00:27:39.800
people who are from all
over the place.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.800
Theodulph of Orleans is
probably a Visigoth.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.500
Paul the Deacon is probably
a Lombard.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.400
Einhard is a Frank.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:52.300
The greatest of these figures,
Alcuin, who was more

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.433
specifically commissioned
by Charlemagne to--

00:27:56.433 --> 00:28:02.267
and Alcuin's dates
are 730-804.

00:28:02.267 --> 00:28:04.500
Alcuin is from Northumbria.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:10.367
Alcuin is from the school
established by Bede.

00:28:10.367 --> 00:28:13.700
These scholars, as you can see,
have different areas of

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:14.967
specialization.

00:28:16.667 --> 00:28:22.233
Their enterprises, or their
duties, were to regularize

00:28:22.233 --> 00:28:31.400
liturgy, to revive rhetoric,
moral theology, logical

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:39.433
argumentation, poetry, and to
argue against theological

00:28:39.433 --> 00:28:40.700
unorthodoxy.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.333
The two theological problems of
the Carolingian Empire were

00:28:47.333 --> 00:28:48.900
iconoclasm--

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.900
debates about that, which we've
already seen in the

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.367
Byzantine Empire--

00:28:52.367 --> 00:28:53.800
and a heresy called
"Adoptionism".

00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:04.767
Adoptionism is the notion that
Christ was a human who was

00:29:04.767 --> 00:29:09.600
essentially adopted by God
to become his son.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.533
It's a heresy that, at the
time of Charlemagne, was

00:29:11.533 --> 00:29:14.367
strong in Spain, or at
least defined as a

00:29:14.367 --> 00:29:17.500
heresy and wiped out.

00:29:23.633 --> 00:29:27.167
We said that there are
twenty-six non-religious

00:29:27.167 --> 00:29:32.633
manuscripts from between
550 and 750.

00:29:32.633 --> 00:29:39.400
For the ninth century, there are
290 classical manuscripts;

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.433
150 for the tenth century.

00:29:41.433 --> 00:29:43.967
So you can see that the ninth
century is kind of a golden

00:29:43.967 --> 00:29:45.767
age of this.

00:29:45.767 --> 00:29:48.467
Although again, we're not
talking about an incredible

00:29:48.467 --> 00:29:50.433
number of things.

00:29:50.433 --> 00:29:55.467
Not an incredible number, but
they're very, very important.

00:29:55.467 --> 00:29:58.467
Many of you have taken
Directed Studies--

00:29:58.467 --> 00:30:03.233
first year, freshman liberal
arts, great books program.

00:30:03.233 --> 00:30:06.833
Well of course, DS doesn't like
the Middle Ages for a

00:30:06.833 --> 00:30:07.567
number of reasons.

00:30:07.567 --> 00:30:11.300
So it's not as if DS decided
that Lupus of Ferrieres is up

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:16.933
there with Plato and Thucydides,
but the things

00:30:16.933 --> 00:30:21.000
that you do read in DS include
Polybius's history of the

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.700
Roman Empire, Livy's
history of the

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:28.600
Roman Republic, Tacitus.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.733
Polybius, Livy, and Tacitus
are authors who depend

00:30:32.733 --> 00:30:35.067
basically on one manuscript.

00:30:35.067 --> 00:30:37.933
And that manuscript is a
Carolingian manuscript.

00:30:37.933 --> 00:30:41.667
For Livy, for example, there's
a lot of his incredibly long

00:30:41.667 --> 00:30:43.800
history that we don't
have. The so-called

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.567
lost decades of Livy.

00:30:46.567 --> 00:30:51.333
Livy's work is divided into
books called decades.

00:30:51.333 --> 00:30:55.433
The fact that we have as much of
Livy as we do is due to the

00:30:55.433 --> 00:30:58.200
Carolingian copying program.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:03.800
The fact that we have Tacitus at
all is due basically to one

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.033
manuscript.

00:31:06.867 --> 00:31:11.700
Cicero's Republic, rediscovered
in the nineteenth

00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:18.600
century, is a palimpsest. And
you'll have heard in section--

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.233
and in the Beinecke tour, a
palimpsest is a manuscript

00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:27.400
that has been scraped of its old
text, a new text put on.

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.233
But the old text is usually more
interesting to us than

00:31:30.233 --> 00:31:36.500
the new one and can be
restored and read.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.300
Most of these are regarded
as discoveries of the

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.467
Renaissance.

00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:46.100
But where the Renaissance
scholars found them was in

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.533
northern monasteries, where they
had been copied and kept

00:31:50.533 --> 00:31:53.933
since Carolingian times.

00:31:53.933 --> 00:31:56.433
Where then, did the Carolingians
get their

00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:58.600
manuscripts?

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.600
Where did they get the
things to copy?

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.233
Which is really a version of the
very perceptive question

00:32:05.233 --> 00:32:08.300
that was asked before.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:12.267
Italy, for the most part
especially Ravenna, Monte

00:32:12.267 --> 00:32:15.967
Casino, and Rome itself.

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:24.833
So, for example, the German
Monastery of Lorsch obtained

00:32:24.833 --> 00:32:27.067
from Italy an ancient
manuscript of

00:32:27.067 --> 00:32:29.500
Virgil and copied it.

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:36.233
They also have, or copied,
Livy's fifth decade-- that is

00:32:36.233 --> 00:32:38.367
part of Livy's Roman history--

00:32:38.367 --> 00:32:42.133
the unique manuscript of the
fifth decade, found in the

00:32:42.133 --> 00:32:44.000
Renaissance at Lorsch.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.067
Copied at Lorsch in the ninth
century from some papyrus

00:32:48.067 --> 00:32:53.700
Italian original,
long since lost.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:57.233
In addition to Lorsch, the
centers of learning include

00:32:57.233 --> 00:33:03.733
Aachen itself, the court of
Charlemagne, Corbie,--

00:33:03.733 --> 00:33:05.000
C-O-R-B-I-E--

00:33:06.833 --> 00:33:07.633
Tours,--

00:33:07.633 --> 00:33:08.900
T-O-U-R-S--

00:33:11.033 --> 00:33:12.833
St. Gall,--

00:33:12.833 --> 00:33:13.867
Saint--

00:33:13.867 --> 00:33:23.333
S-T Gall, G-A-L-L. And these
libraries, we can see their

00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:25.600
growth during this period.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:36.467
So, for example, the Monastery
of Reichenau, on an island in

00:33:36.467 --> 00:33:37.733
Lake Constance.

00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:43.733
In 800, the year that
Charlemagne was crowned as

00:33:43.733 --> 00:33:47.700
emperor, Reichenau
had fifty books.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:56.900
In 846, it had 1,000.

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.633
Well, all of this emphasis on
education and classical

00:33:59.633 --> 00:34:01.200
learning is extremely
important.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.933
And indeed, it merits those
kinds of "How blank saved

00:34:07.933 --> 00:34:11.700
blank". "How the Carolingians
saved classical civilization",

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.300
in this case.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.300
But it does not mark a break
with the piety and

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:19.133
spirituality of the era.

00:34:19.133 --> 00:34:19.467
and.

00:34:19.467 --> 00:34:23.433
That's part of the point
of the Einhard reading.

00:34:23.433 --> 00:34:27.533
Einhard is a critical figure in
the court of Charlemagne,

00:34:27.533 --> 00:34:30.933
and of his son, Louis the Pious,
about whom you'll be

00:34:30.933 --> 00:34:35.233
reading shortly, or
have been reading.

00:34:35.233 --> 00:34:39.333
And in Einhard, we see an
example of an intellectual of

00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:41.700
this period and of this place.

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:57.067
Einhard is active in the
court of Charlemagne.

00:34:57.067 --> 00:35:00.500
He would be one of Charlemagne's
biographers, as

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.967
we know, having read him.

00:35:02.967 --> 00:35:06.667
He's also a monastic
entrepreneur.

00:35:06.667 --> 00:35:12.667
I did say that this society
doesn't encourage intellectual

00:35:12.667 --> 00:35:15.767
entrepreneurship in the sense
of coming up with new ideas,

00:35:15.767 --> 00:35:18.400
but it's a very entrepreneurial
society in the

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:23.700
sense of getting saints, getting
relics, establishing

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.100
monasteries, becoming popular.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:29.267
It's a very competitive
business environment.

00:35:29.267 --> 00:35:32.767
And Einhard, as you've seen,
was very good at this.

00:35:32.767 --> 00:35:36.433
He had several monasteries
and churches under his

00:35:36.433 --> 00:35:37.400
jurisdiction.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:43.033
But his pet project, not that
far from Frankfurt on the Main

00:35:43.033 --> 00:35:44.267
River, is Seligenstadt.

00:35:48.167 --> 00:35:51.400
And it's at Seligenstadt that
eventually those relics of

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:58.833
Saints Marcellinus and Peter
come to rest. Note that the

00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:04.067
saints, Marcellinus and Peter,
were acquired from Italy, just

00:36:04.067 --> 00:36:05.333
like the manuscripts.

00:36:05.333 --> 00:36:10.033
Because Italy is where there
are an awful lot of saints

00:36:10.033 --> 00:36:13.100
from the Roman martyr period.

00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.533
There are even more saints,
actually, in places like North

00:36:15.533 --> 00:36:19.133
Africa or Egypt, but they're
tough to get at, because it's

00:36:19.133 --> 00:36:22.333
a long trip and they're
Muslim.

00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:26.567
Nevertheless, we know that
lots of relics were

00:36:26.567 --> 00:36:28.167
liberated--

00:36:28.167 --> 00:36:30.467
to use a rather 1970s term--

00:36:30.467 --> 00:36:33.900
from Muslim captivity.

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.100
Liberated--

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:39.133
and, of course, it's not as if
Einhard, in talking about what

00:36:39.133 --> 00:36:44.500
is called the "translation" of
relics, says that he bought

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.233
them, or that he came by
them, quote, honestly.

00:36:49.233 --> 00:36:52.700
Translation meaning here, the
movement, the moving of the

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:56.633
relics from one place
to another.

00:36:56.633 --> 00:37:00.267
Marcellinus and Peter
were buried in

00:37:00.267 --> 00:37:05.233
Rome and in a church.

00:37:08.467 --> 00:37:13.633
And Einhard's agents negotiate
with this dubious kind of

00:37:13.633 --> 00:37:15.933
character, who maybe
can get them some

00:37:15.933 --> 00:37:17.433
relics and maybe not.

00:37:17.433 --> 00:37:20.700
And maybe it will require more
money, or he's got to talk to

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.000
a couple of guys.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.467
And it's this intrigue.

00:37:25.467 --> 00:37:27.433
And that's part of the story.

00:37:27.433 --> 00:37:31.067
The implication is that
Marcellinus and

00:37:31.067 --> 00:37:34.267
Peter want to move.

00:37:34.267 --> 00:37:36.300
They let their tombs be found.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.533
Remember that in looking for St.
Tiberius, it's too heavy

00:37:39.533 --> 00:37:41.700
to lift the altar up.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.667
They can't do it.

00:37:42.667 --> 00:37:47.067
On the other hand, with these
saints, no problem.

00:37:47.067 --> 00:37:50.767
And once they come to
Seligenstadt, they perform all

00:37:50.767 --> 00:37:55.667
these miracles, which shows
they're happy there.

00:37:55.667 --> 00:37:57.167
Sure, they were stolen.

00:37:57.167 --> 00:38:01.133
And in fact, as Wickham remarks,
and as you've read,

00:38:01.133 --> 00:38:06.900
Hilduin, a competitor of
Einhard's, had stolen some of

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:09.700
Saint Marcellinus.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.667
And Einhard got him to
return it, pressured

00:38:12.667 --> 00:38:14.433
him to return it.

00:38:14.433 --> 00:38:16.567
And eventually, Hilduin
was disgraced.

00:38:16.567 --> 00:38:20.200
And I can't remember if he's
executed or merely exiled.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.333
But this is a tough business.

00:38:25.633 --> 00:38:32.800
So in 827, these relics
get moved.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.267
Let me read you, since this is
in a part of the Einhard book

00:38:36.267 --> 00:38:39.933
that we didn't assign.

00:38:39.933 --> 00:38:41.167
Let me just--

00:38:45.467 --> 00:38:45.967
Yeah.

00:38:45.967 --> 00:38:48.700
It begins on page 69,
if you're interested

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:49.333
in following this.

00:38:49.333 --> 00:38:51.667
And they even have the itinerary
of the relics.

00:38:51.667 --> 00:38:54.967
So "after a fast of three
days, they"--

00:38:54.967 --> 00:38:56.100
his emissaries--

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.367
"traveled by night to that
place without any Roman

00:38:59.367 --> 00:39:01.500
citizens noticing them.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.633
Once in the Church of St.
Tiburtius, they first tried to

00:39:04.633 --> 00:39:07.533
open the altar under which it
was believed his holy body was

00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:10.667
located, but the strenuous
nature of the job they had

00:39:10.667 --> 00:39:13.333
started foiled their plan, for
the monument was constructed

00:39:13.333 --> 00:39:17.100
of extremely hard marble and
easily resisted the bare hands

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.833
of those trying to open it.

00:39:18.833 --> 00:39:21.433
Therefore, they abandoned the
tomb of that martyr and

00:39:21.433 --> 00:39:24.967
descended to the tomb of the
blessed Marcellinus and Peter.

00:39:24.967 --> 00:39:29.100
There, once they had called on
our Lord, Jesus Christ, and

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.233
adored the holy martyrs, they
were able to lift the

00:39:32.233 --> 00:39:34.933
tombstone from its place
covering the top of the

00:39:34.933 --> 00:39:37.267
sepulcher."

00:39:37.267 --> 00:39:41.467
Then they take it; they wrap
them in a clean linen shroud.

00:39:44.967 --> 00:39:47.800
They take just St. Marcellinus,
and they wrap him

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.767
in a shroud.

00:39:48.767 --> 00:39:50.733
And then they put the tombstone
back in place,

00:39:50.733 --> 00:39:53.767
quote, "so that no trace of
the body's removal would

00:39:53.767 --> 00:39:57.167
remain." But then, just as
they're about to make their

00:39:57.167 --> 00:40:02.233
escape, the deacon, one of this
group, says, "Oh, my God,

00:40:02.233 --> 00:40:04.200
we can't leave without
Saint Peter.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.133
These two were companions
in life.

00:40:06.133 --> 00:40:08.033
We can't just take one
of these bodies.

00:40:08.033 --> 00:40:10.600
We have to go back and
take the other one."

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.967
They go back, and they
get the body.

00:40:12.967 --> 00:40:14.767
So this is an adventure story.

00:40:14.767 --> 00:40:22.033
But it's a sacred adventure and
it involves the relics of

00:40:22.033 --> 00:40:27.033
people who still have some say
in where they want to be.

00:40:27.033 --> 00:40:31.000
The very special dead, as Peter
Brown refers to them.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.333
And what's very special about
them is that they're not

00:40:33.333 --> 00:40:36.700
exactly what you would
normally call "dead".

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:39.400
Their relics are very
much active.

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.333
Now, we read in the series of
miracles performed by these

00:40:46.333 --> 00:40:50.467
saints, along with another saint
they picked up, Hermes,

00:40:50.467 --> 00:40:52.267
various medical cures.

00:40:52.267 --> 00:40:56.033
Notice that these miracles,
unlike Gregory of Tours, are

00:40:56.033 --> 00:40:58.667
pretty exclusively
in one category.

00:40:58.667 --> 00:41:01.933
Gregory of Tours has a lot of
what might be called "scoffers

00:41:01.933 --> 00:41:03.700
punished" miracles.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.067
Somebody either tries to fake
a miracle, and then is the

00:41:07.067 --> 00:41:08.933
victim of a real one.

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:12.500
Or somebody tries to
defy the bishop.

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:15.533
Or somebody doubts the efficacy
of the saint.

00:41:15.533 --> 00:41:19.367
In this case, most of these
miracles, almost all of them,

00:41:19.367 --> 00:41:25.200
are people with paralysis,
disease of the bowels,

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:28.500
horrible sores, blindness.

00:41:32.333 --> 00:41:33.500
Where to start?

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.600
How great are these?

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.333
I know you could not
put this down.

00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:47.500
And I hope you read it to your
molecular biology roommates

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.867
just to show how
great this is.

00:41:57.233 --> 00:41:58.567
I think I have this in
the wrong place.

00:41:58.567 --> 00:42:05.033
Anyway, remember the curing
of the angry humpback?

00:42:05.033 --> 00:42:09.633
These guys are carrying the
relics to Seligenstadt and

00:42:09.633 --> 00:42:11.767
they stop to rest in a field.

00:42:11.767 --> 00:42:15.000
And this angry peasant with
a pitchfork wants

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.067
to chase them away.

00:42:16.067 --> 00:42:18.333
He also has a humpback.

00:42:18.333 --> 00:42:22.667
And they show him the relics
and say what they're doing.

00:42:22.667 --> 00:42:26.700
And he falls to his
face in adoration.

00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:29.233
He is cured of his
afflictions.

00:42:29.233 --> 00:42:35.267
And the people of the village
insist that the emissaries

00:42:35.267 --> 00:42:39.733
stay with them, have a kind of
party all night, bring other

00:42:39.733 --> 00:42:42.400
villagers in.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:43.967
This is an interesting moment.

00:42:43.967 --> 00:42:49.867
And I mention it because here,
the piety of a person like

00:42:49.867 --> 00:42:54.500
Einhard is the same as the
piety of the villagers.

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:59.200
The Carolingian Renaissance is
mostly about an elite program

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:03.000
to try to preserve elite
forms of knowledge.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.033
True, it is an effort to educate
the populace, but that

00:43:07.033 --> 00:43:11.033
is probably the least successful
aspect of it.

00:43:11.033 --> 00:43:16.100
The literacy rate in 875 was
hardly any greater than it had

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:22.267
been in 775, if you could do
a statistical study, and it

00:43:22.267 --> 00:43:24.567
wasn't very high.

00:43:24.567 --> 00:43:27.333
But when it comes to the saints,
and to the meaning of

00:43:27.333 --> 00:43:36.967
the supernatural in regular
life, the most learned people

00:43:36.967 --> 00:43:41.333
have the same attitude
as the villagers

00:43:41.333 --> 00:43:42.700
of this little story.

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.167
OK.

00:43:47.167 --> 00:43:49.733
So we've reached the height
of the Carolingian

00:43:49.733 --> 00:43:52.233
Empire in two days.

00:43:52.233 --> 00:43:57.267
And then, our next discussion
will be about its precipitous

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:59.233
and, in many respects,
unfortunate decline.

00:43:59.233 --> 00:44:00.867
That's what we'll talk
about on Wednesday.

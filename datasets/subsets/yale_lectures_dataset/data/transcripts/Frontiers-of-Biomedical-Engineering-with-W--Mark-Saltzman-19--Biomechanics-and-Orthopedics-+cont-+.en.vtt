00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.818
Professor Mark Saltzman:
So, today we're going to

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:16.550
continue talking about the
subject of biomechanics.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.793
On Tuesday we talked about
properties of materials and

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:27.730
particularly elasticity and
viscosity and viscoelasticity.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.645
So, you know something about
how biological materials behave,

00:00:31.645 --> 00:00:35.626
at least in terms of how they
respond in terms of deformations

00:00:35.626 --> 00:00:38.281
to forces.
Certainly there's a lot more to

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:41.370
learn about that but we covered
the basics on Tuesday.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.396
Today I want to talk about
how organisms move,

00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:50.080
and how they move through a
physical world where they have

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.585
to obey the laws of physics.
This is one important role of

00:00:54.585 --> 00:00:56.849
biomechanics,
to sort of understand,

00:00:56.849 --> 00:00:59.890
if you're thinking about human
biomechanics,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.590
how humans perform as sort of
mechanical machines.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.227
That's one important role of
biomechanics,

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:11.993
how organisms,
not just humans but all kinds

00:01:11.993 --> 00:01:15.209
of organisms function in an
engineering sense.

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:20.489
A big part of that is how they
survive, and not only survive,

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:25.504
but prosper in a world where
they have to obey the laws of

00:01:25.504 --> 00:01:28.390
physics.
It's interesting to try to

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.683
understand this because if we
understood sort of how the human

00:01:32.683 --> 00:01:34.753
machine works,
for example,

00:01:34.753 --> 00:01:39.264
under normal conditions you can
think about, 'How can I enhance

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:42.030
performance in certain
conditions?'

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.656
That of course is a big part of
exercise physiology is

00:01:46.656 --> 00:01:51.720
understanding how humans work as
biomechanical machines.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.261
What we're going to talk
about today with the example I

00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.987
want to use as just an example
of this is motion in biological

00:01:58.987 --> 00:02:00.700
systems.
In particular,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.200
motion that humans can't do on
their own, flying.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.122
Motions that we do all the time
walking, and a kind of motion

00:02:09.122 --> 00:02:13.060
that we do occasionally,
some of us, swimming.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.323
Think about how you would apply
what you know about physics to

00:02:17.323 --> 00:02:21.354
understanding those processes.
Why, in general,

00:02:21.354 --> 00:02:25.280
do organisms have an ability
move?

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.030
Think about organisms like us
or organisms like bacteria,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.960
it's one of the essential
ingredients of life.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.881
One of the ways that we
recognize that things are alive

00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:41.910
is because they're able to move
from one spot to another,

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.750
so why is motion so important?

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.424
Why is motion important in the
life of a microorganism,

00:02:52.424 --> 00:02:57.159
a protozoa, or a bacteria
that's swimming around in the

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.071
ocean, why should it move?
Student:

00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:01.050
[inaudible]Professor Mark
Saltzman: To find nutrients;

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.958
to eat and to find the
nutrients or sub-straits that

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.890
are essential to its growth.
If you think about the

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.774
movements that you make during
the course of the day,

00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:12.879
how many of them are motivated
by your need for food?

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.103
You move in order to find
things that you can eat and

00:03:17.103 --> 00:03:20.840
that's one reason why living
organisms move.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.434
Why else do they move?
Justin?Student: To

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:25.470
avoid danger.Professor
Mark Saltzman: To avoid

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.780
danger, to get out of harm's
way.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.191
If you're a microorganism what
would be dangerous to you is

00:03:29.191 --> 00:03:31.459
often chemicals.
There might be chemicals around

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.203
you that are toxic to you,
and so you'll swim to get away

00:03:34.203 --> 00:03:37.238
from those chemicals.
If you're a rabbit in the

00:03:37.238 --> 00:03:41.848
woods, you might be running to
get away from a fox or a wolf or

00:03:41.848 --> 00:03:44.599
something that's going to eat
you.

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.532
If you're a human you might run
out of Prospect Street to avoid

00:03:49.532 --> 00:03:53.669
getting hit by a bus,
that's a good use of motion for

00:03:53.669 --> 00:04:02.625
self preservation;
one more key reason why animals

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.020
move;

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.888
essential for propagation of
the species, not just survival

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:18.098
of the organism.
Justin?Student:

00:04:18.098 --> 00:04:19.681
Mating.Professor Mark
Saltzman: To reproduce,

00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:22.356
they move to reproduce,
to get together and that might

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:25.310
be some of the reasons why you
move everyday.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.268
Certainly in the animal world,
in general, movement for

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:31.907
finding mates,
for reproduction is an

00:04:31.907 --> 00:04:35.794
essential part of it.
So, easy to see why movement is

00:04:35.794 --> 00:04:39.240
critical, for not just the life
of a microorganism,

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.058
not just the life of a
multicellular organism,

00:04:42.058 --> 00:04:44.690
but for survival of the species
as well.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.830
Movement requires force and
we're going to think about

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.743
forces.
In particular,

00:04:52.743 --> 00:04:56.383
the forces that an organism
needs to develop somehow or

00:04:56.383 --> 00:05:00.360
generate in order to overcome
forces that resist motion,

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.219
so just some elementary physics
here which most of you probably

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:06.459
remember from high school
physics,

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:11.591
is that if an object,
the object here is this green

00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:14.304
oval.
If it's going to be moving with

00:05:14.304 --> 00:05:16.750
a constant speed what does that
mean?

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:19.439
Moving with a constant speed
means not accelerating.

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:24.149
There has to be some force
applied in order to create the

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:28.858
motion but the forces must
balance, so the overall forces

00:05:28.858 --> 00:05:32.360
acting are zero.
For an object that's not

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.379
accelerating the sum of the
forces is zero because the

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:40.383
acceleration is zero.
If we think about this

00:05:40.383 --> 00:05:44.161
green object moving to the
right, to the left,

00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:49.367
to the--to your left then there
must be a force that's creating

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:54.237
the motion to the left and that
force is just big enough to

00:05:54.237 --> 00:05:57.680
overcome the resistance to
motion.

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.265
That force is equally balanced
with whatever force resists

00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.154
motion.
Of course the force that

00:06:04.154 --> 00:06:07.065
resists motion is going to be
different if you're an organism

00:06:07.065 --> 00:06:09.301
that's trying to fly,
than if you're an organism

00:06:09.301 --> 00:06:11.608
that's trying to move along the
ground, than if you're an

00:06:11.608 --> 00:06:15.189
organism that's trying to swim.
So, what we're going to think

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:19.473
about today are the forces that
resist that motion and how

00:06:19.473 --> 00:06:22.329
organisms overcome that
resistance.

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:26.428
If we think about flight first
then the situation is a little

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:29.286
bit more complicated.
What's the force that

00:06:29.286 --> 00:06:31.865
creates motion?
Well, there's got to be some

00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:35.626
propulsive force that's moving
us--that's moving the organism

00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:40.145
forward or to the left here.
There has to be some propulsive

00:06:40.145 --> 00:06:44.549
force that opposes the force
that resists that motion,

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:48.609
and that force is drag.
It's drag on the object that's

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:52.217
flying the air and that drag
comes from the interaction of

00:06:52.217 --> 00:06:54.940
the surface of that object with
the air.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.050
It has to move air out of the
way in order to move ahead.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.315
In order to move with a
constant speed,

00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:04.012
there has to be a force that's
pushing it to the right and that

00:07:04.012 --> 00:07:07.471
force has to be exactly opposite
to the drag force which is

00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:11.640
resisting that movement.
That drag force comes from

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.120
displacement of air,
friction of air.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.186
You have experienced this
drag force if you are driving in

00:07:18.186 --> 00:07:20.800
a car and you stick your hand
out the open window,

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.870
you can feel the force that's
pushing your arm backward.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:27.964
In order for you to hold your
arm straight out you have to

00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:30.842
apply a force in the forward
direction that's directly

00:07:30.842 --> 00:07:34.262
opposed to the force that's from
the air that's pushing your arm

00:07:34.262 --> 00:07:37.233
back.
As the car goes faster,

00:07:37.233 --> 00:07:43.322
it takes more force to move it
ahead, it takes more force to

00:07:43.322 --> 00:07:47.143
hold it steady.
So, the amount of force that

00:07:47.143 --> 00:07:50.860
you need to apply varies with
the speed that you go.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.559
The faster the car is going the
more force you have to apply to

00:07:54.559 --> 00:07:58.036
hold your arm out steady,
the faster a bird flies the

00:07:58.036 --> 00:08:01.908
more force it has to apply in
order to overcome this drag

00:08:01.908 --> 00:08:04.949
force that's opposing its
forward motion.

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:09.340
That's the dynamics,
that's the force balance in the

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:13.713
horizontal direction;
propulsive force overcoming the

00:08:13.713 --> 00:08:16.491
drag force.
You know it also depends on

00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:18.452
shape.
If you hold your arm out this

00:08:18.452 --> 00:08:21.749
way, you hold your arm out this
way, you feel a different force

00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:25.343
from the air.
The shape or the profile of the

00:08:25.343 --> 00:08:30.742
object that's in this field also
matters, keep that in mind as

00:08:30.742 --> 00:08:32.812
well.
If you're going to fly there's

00:08:32.812 --> 00:08:35.400
another force you have to
overcome and that's the force of

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.174
gravity.
That's the force of gravity

00:08:38.174 --> 00:08:41.879
that is pulling you down towards
the Earth.

00:08:41.879 --> 00:08:45.695
To overcome that force,
that constant force,

00:08:45.695 --> 00:08:49.509
there has to be a force that's
moving up.

00:08:49.509 --> 00:08:53.280
If you're going to maintain a
constant height,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:58.476
a zero velocity up and down was
what you would need to maintain

00:08:58.476 --> 00:09:02.219
a constant height,
then you'd have to have a force

00:09:02.219 --> 00:09:05.895
that's lifting you up that's
exactly opposite to the force of

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:09.040
gravity.
If you're going to fly you have

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.830
to have that upward force as
well.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.230
What kinds of objects can
fly?

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.918
Planes can fly,
this is a picture of an old

00:09:16.918 --> 00:09:19.960
fashioned plane.
Maybe you've ridden on a plane

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:23.424
that has a propeller on it,
maybe not, but it's a little

00:09:23.424 --> 00:09:28.055
bit easier to describe this way;
that the forward force that

00:09:28.055 --> 00:09:33.715
overcomes drag is provided by a
propeller that spins and creates

00:09:33.715 --> 00:09:36.950
a force in the forward
direction.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.049
In order to move at a constant
velocity, depending on what that

00:09:40.049 --> 00:09:42.778
velocity is,
you have to overcome a certain

00:09:42.778 --> 00:09:46.700
amount of drag and the propeller
spins at a speed that will

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.269
provide that force to move
forward.

00:09:49.269 --> 00:09:52.794
That seems, if not a complete
description, that seems like a

00:09:52.794 --> 00:09:55.899
pretty adequate description of
how you move ahead.

00:09:55.899 --> 00:09:59.208
How do you get off the
ground and maintain off the

00:09:59.208 --> 00:10:02.080
ground, maintain your height off
the ground?

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.789
In order to do that,
you have to overcome this

00:10:04.789 --> 00:10:08.039
constant force of gravity which
is pulling you back.

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:12.305
That's the main problem with
flight, overcoming the force of

00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:16.860
gravity and in airplanes that's
done through design of wings.

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.720
A typical, sort of airfoil or
wing design is shown here.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.987
What happens is it's using this
flow of air, this constant flow

00:10:25.987 --> 00:10:28.975
of air over the body,
over the wings for example,

00:10:28.975 --> 00:10:32.151
by changing the shape so that
there's more surface area on top

00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:34.389
of the wing than there is on the
bottom.

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:37.234
You change the relative
velocities that air can move

00:10:37.234 --> 00:10:39.745
over the wing,
over the top of the wing versus

00:10:39.745 --> 00:10:43.834
over the bottom of the wing,
you create a flow separation or

00:10:43.834 --> 00:10:48.145
a disturbance here where the
pressure drops relative to the

00:10:48.145 --> 00:10:53.295
pressure in the ambient air.
The pressure drops because

00:10:53.295 --> 00:10:56.710
of this turbulent air flow
pattern.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:11:00.925
If there's less pressure here
than there is down here,

00:11:00.925 --> 00:11:05.379
you get a force acting up,
pressure is force per area.

00:11:05.379 --> 00:11:08.365
If there's a difference in
pressures from top to bottom,

00:11:08.365 --> 00:11:11.187
more pressure on the bottom
than there is on the top,

00:11:11.187 --> 00:11:13.250
you'll have a lift force going
up.

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:18.211
You can fly if that lift force
is large enough to overcome,

00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:21.890
or at least balance the force
of gravity.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:25.056
Does that make sense?
You can imagine that that lift

00:11:25.056 --> 00:11:28.389
force varies with speed that
you're moving through the air.

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:30.942
For example,
there's a critical speed you

00:11:30.942 --> 00:11:34.770
have to reach before you get
enough lift to take off and that

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:38.790
lift force depends on the design
of the exact shape of the wings

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.429
or the airfoil,
certainly depends on their size.

00:11:42.429 --> 00:11:47.881
If I've got bigger wings and
pressure's what's moving me,

00:11:47.881 --> 00:11:53.429
force is pressure per area,
bigger wings more force up.

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:57.314
The basic physics here is
fairly straight forward,

00:11:57.314 --> 00:12:00.539
although implementing this took
some time,

00:12:00.539 --> 00:12:03.053
people have been trying to fly
as long as there were people

00:12:03.053 --> 00:12:06.582
watching birds.
It took awhile for us to figure

00:12:06.582 --> 00:12:12.168
out how to implement this and to
implement it as reliably as we

00:12:12.168 --> 00:12:15.410
can now.
How do birds do this?

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:19.274
How do birds fly?
Well, birds don't have

00:12:19.274 --> 00:12:21.389
stationary wings,
typically.

00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:24.129
Although their wings can be
stationary;

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:27.624
if you watch a hawk or an eagle
or a large bird,

00:12:27.624 --> 00:12:32.159
they glide for a lot of their
flight once they're airborne.

00:12:32.159 --> 00:12:35.212
If you watch,
my office overlooks the Grove

00:12:35.212 --> 00:12:38.628
Street cemetery,
there's some hawks that live in

00:12:38.628 --> 00:12:42.190
the cemetery,
must be a good place for hawks.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.507
T hey take off and then they
glide for long periods,

00:12:45.507 --> 00:12:49.019
they can circle and there's
very little motion of their

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.839
wings.
They're basically

00:12:50.839 --> 00:12:55.103
doing--they're taking advantage
of the forward thrust that they

00:12:55.103 --> 00:12:58.679
have created and they're
coasting but their wings are

00:12:58.679 --> 00:13:01.585
doing this.
They're holding their wings in

00:13:01.585 --> 00:13:04.895
a position that creates an
airfoil, creates the pressure

00:13:04.895 --> 00:13:08.237
drip to move them up.
To take off or to create

00:13:08.237 --> 00:13:12.101
this forward thrust they move
their wings, they don't have

00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:15.006
propellers.
So, they use their wings to

00:13:15.006 --> 00:13:19.570
create thrust by sort of pushing
them against the air backwards,

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:23.700
by creating a forward thrust
which overcomes the drag.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.852
Yet their wings are shaped like
an airfoil so they create

00:13:26.852 --> 00:13:29.891
thrust, they bring them back
into the airfoil position,

00:13:29.891 --> 00:13:32.648
and they get lift.
So, it's more complicated than

00:13:32.648 --> 00:13:35.585
what I'm describing but you can
see beating your wings like

00:13:35.585 --> 00:13:37.113
this,
creating thrust in one

00:13:37.113 --> 00:13:40.230
direction, holding them in a
position where you create lift.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:44.183
Then, varying between those two
things you can both move forward

00:13:44.183 --> 00:13:48.200
and supply the lift you need to
overcome the force of gravity.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.632
If you watch different kinds of
birds you'll see that they

00:13:51.632 --> 00:13:54.763
execute different kinds of
patterns, and they do that

00:13:54.763 --> 00:13:58.107
because they're different.
Some birds are smaller than

00:13:58.107 --> 00:14:00.954
others, some are bigger,
some have different shaped

00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:05.369
wings, different shaped bodies.
So, their particular motion is

00:14:05.369 --> 00:14:10.409
adapted to the physics of their
body and their need to move it

00:14:10.409 --> 00:14:11.980
through the air.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.179
I talked a bit about wing
size.

00:14:18.179 --> 00:14:22.281
Wing size is one thing that you
could use in an airplane,

00:14:22.281 --> 00:14:24.112
for example,
bigger wings,

00:14:24.112 --> 00:14:26.871
more upward lift.
Bigger wings,

00:14:26.871 --> 00:14:30.535
of course, heavier.
So, if it's heavier it's going

00:14:30.535 --> 00:14:33.869
to require a bigger engine so
that you can get the thrust

00:14:33.869 --> 00:14:36.250
needed to move at a certain
velocity.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.689
If you look at birds of
different sizes,

00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:41.879
or flying animals of any kind
of different sizes,

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:44.744
you'll notice that there's a
correlation between the size of

00:14:44.744 --> 00:14:46.590
the wing and the size of the
animal.

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.850
The bigger the bird,
typically, the bigger the wings

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.165
for just that reason;
bigger bird heavier,

00:14:52.165 --> 00:14:57.789
needs more lift in order to get
up into the air.

00:14:57.789 --> 00:15:00.250
You also notice other kinds
of adaptations;

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:05.487
that birds that have big wings,
big bodies, also tend to have

00:15:05.487 --> 00:15:07.567
strong legs.
Little birds,

00:15:07.567 --> 00:15:10.732
isn't it amazing,
little birds you see perched on

00:15:10.732 --> 00:15:13.700
a tree limb or something,
very small legs.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:17.280
Big birds, hawks,
falcons, eagles,

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.938
strong legs;
why would a big bird need

00:15:19.938 --> 00:15:20.530
strong legs?

00:15:25.679 --> 00:15:30.549
Well, they actually pick up
prey and things and so they use

00:15:30.549 --> 00:15:34.580
them for acquiring food,
that's a good reason.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.019
Why do they need them for
flight?

00:15:38.019 --> 00:15:40.087
They need to be able to lift
off and so to get that

00:15:40.087 --> 00:15:42.404
initial--maybe they get some
boost from their legs in the

00:15:42.404 --> 00:15:45.068
lift off phase,
some forward thrust and some

00:15:45.068 --> 00:15:48.623
upward lift, just from the
muscular structure of their

00:15:48.623 --> 00:15:51.945
legs.
They're not always in flight,

00:15:51.945 --> 00:15:57.131
they need to land sometimes and
they land on their legs

00:15:57.131 --> 00:15:59.655
typically.
If you're going to bring a big

00:15:59.655 --> 00:16:01.994
object down to the ground
there's going to be some force

00:16:01.994 --> 00:16:06.042
involved with that.
You need large legs in order to

00:16:06.042 --> 00:16:10.526
survive that force.
Just giving you some examples

00:16:10.526 --> 00:16:15.563
of how the physical structure of
animals is adapted to their

00:16:15.563 --> 00:16:20.259
function and a lot of it is
their function as mechanical

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:23.561
objects.
It's a familiar concept but one

00:16:23.561 --> 00:16:28.050
can sort of break it apart.
An interesting kind of bird

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:30.480
is shown here,
a hummingbird;

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.210
have you ever watched a
hummingbird?

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.371
Hummingbirds do something
that's really amazing,

00:16:35.371 --> 00:16:39.272
they hover, which means they
can stay up in the air without

00:16:39.272 --> 00:16:43.050
having any forward thrust.
When I was talking about the

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.627
airplane example or even the
bird example,

00:16:45.627 --> 00:16:49.085
I was talking about using the
forward motion supplied by

00:16:49.085 --> 00:16:52.731
thrust in order to create the
pressure drop that brings you

00:16:52.731 --> 00:16:55.504
up.
But if you stop moving forward

00:16:55.504 --> 00:16:58.649
that pressure drop disappears,
you go down.

00:16:58.649 --> 00:17:02.811
Forward motion is required for
an airplane to stay up in the

00:17:02.811 --> 00:17:06.055
air, for a bird,
most birds that stay up in the

00:17:06.055 --> 00:17:08.147
air.
Hummingbirds can hover

00:17:08.147 --> 00:17:11.612
which is a remarkable physical
achievement, and they do that

00:17:11.612 --> 00:17:15.430
because they can actually turn
their wings in both directions.

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:18.504
They can turn them upside down
and that's shown in this diagram

00:17:18.504 --> 00:17:21.480
here, that they can make the
wing go backward and forward,

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:26.400
and turn it right side up and
upside down, so they can create

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.910
a motion where they're creating
no net forward thrust or

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:34.291
backward thrust,
but always creating lift

00:17:34.291 --> 00:17:38.501
because they're changing the
position or the orientation of

00:17:38.501 --> 00:17:41.282
their wings.
More complicated than that,

00:17:41.282 --> 00:17:45.170
if you're interested I'm sure
you can find information on it,

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:48.568
but again they can do this
because they have specially

00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:52.160
designed wings that can flip
over during their motion.

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.787
They have the muscles that
allow them to make this kind of

00:17:55.787 --> 00:17:59.415
a motion, and they're fairly
small so they don't need much

00:17:59.415 --> 00:18:03.488
lift force in order to keep them
aloft to overcome the problem of

00:18:03.488 --> 00:18:05.837
gravity.
Hummingbirds can hover because

00:18:05.837 --> 00:18:08.799
they generate lift in both the
upstroke and the down stroke.

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:11.903
As long as their wings are in
motion they're constantly

00:18:11.903 --> 00:18:14.087
creating lift,
and so they stay off the

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:14.720
ground.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.561
That's something about flight,
which is interesting,

00:18:21.561 --> 00:18:25.539
and I think maybe the simplest
one to think about because one

00:18:25.539 --> 00:18:29.650
can break down the forces that
are involved fairly easily.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:34.008
Let's think about walking
and running, or a mode--nobody

00:18:34.008 --> 00:18:37.923
flew here this morning,
you got here to class somehow,

00:18:37.923 --> 00:18:42.280
how did you get here?
Most of you probably walked,

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.405
maybe some of you ran,
but most of you probably

00:18:46.405 --> 00:18:50.884
walked, why?
Of all the choices that you had

00:18:50.884 --> 00:18:56.343
why did you walk instead of
slithering on the ground or

00:18:56.343 --> 00:19:02.490
crawling, or running?
Why did you walk?

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.577
Why did you make that choice?
You might didn't have even

00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:06.400
thought about it,
you probably didn't get to the

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.609
room--to the door of your room
and say should I crawl,

00:19:08.609 --> 00:19:11.867
slither, run,
or walk you probably just

00:19:11.867 --> 00:19:16.240
started walking.
Why was that your first choice?

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.129
Justin?Student: It
seems natural.Professor

00:19:18.129 --> 00:19:19.410
Mark Saltzman: It comes
naturally.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.950
Why do you think that's your
natural motion for moving along

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:29.119
the surface of the Earth?
Why is that your natural choice?

00:19:29.119 --> 00:19:32.340
Why have you decided,
even without thinking about it,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.880
that that's your normal mode of
motion?

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.667
Yeah?Student:
[Inaudible]Professor Mark

00:19:37.667 --> 00:19:41.165
Saltzman: It's the easiest,
it's the least resistant,

00:19:41.165 --> 00:19:45.839
it's the most efficient way to
move from one place to another,

00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:47.799
and its efficiency that's
important.

00:19:47.799 --> 00:19:49.660
Now, how would you define
efficiency here?

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.380
How much energy did you need to
expend to get from your room to

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:57.039
here and how can you get from
your room to here minimizing the

00:19:57.039 --> 00:20:00.670
amount of energy that you spend?
That's the subconscious

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:04.250
decision that you make and the
answer is that you walk.

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:08.982
What force are you
overcoming when you're walking

00:20:08.982 --> 00:20:11.822
here?
What's the force that opposes

00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:14.081
your motion?
The force that creates your

00:20:14.081 --> 00:20:16.765
motion is the movement of the
muscles or your leg and your

00:20:16.765 --> 00:20:19.404
skeleton.
So, like rocking back and forth

00:20:19.404 --> 00:20:23.418
like this I'm using my muscles
to create motion side to side,

00:20:23.418 --> 00:20:26.630
and you use a similar strategy
when you walk.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:29.619
What force am I overcoming when
I do this?

00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:33.569
What force did you have to
overcome in order to get here?

00:20:33.569 --> 00:20:36.505
Well, you're not--there is a
drag force because you're moving

00:20:36.505 --> 00:20:39.494
through air.
So just like a flying bird,

00:20:39.494 --> 00:20:44.615
you're experiencing drag from
the atmosphere but it turns out

00:20:44.615 --> 00:20:49.736
that that's not as large as the
frictional force of your body

00:20:49.736 --> 00:20:53.881
touching the ground.
When you walked you probably

00:20:53.881 --> 00:20:58.406
didn't walk like with your feet
on the ground because that would

00:20:58.406 --> 00:21:01.723
take a lot of energy.
Try it, try walking back home

00:21:01.723 --> 00:21:05.076
with your feet constantly on the
ground, that takes a lot more

00:21:05.076 --> 00:21:09.972
energy than picking them up.
You pay a price for picking

00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:12.564
them up.
Now, you're introducing another

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:15.892
problem, actually two problems,
in that when you pick up a foot

00:21:15.892 --> 00:21:19.565
you have to overcome gravity,
so you're using some of your

00:21:19.565 --> 00:21:22.150
motion to go in the wrong
direction.

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:26.403
Instead of moving towards class
you're moving up by picking your

00:21:26.403 --> 00:21:30.657
leg up, which is not getting you
any closer to where you want to

00:21:30.657 --> 00:21:33.482
be.
You pick it up in order to

00:21:33.482 --> 00:21:38.819
release from the frictional
forces that are holding it back,

00:21:38.819 --> 00:21:42.800
the frictional forces that
resist motion.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.488
How do you walk then?
You don't walk with your feet

00:21:46.488 --> 00:21:49.341
constantly in contact with the
ground, although that would be

00:21:49.341 --> 00:21:52.625
easier in a sense,
because if your feet are both

00:21:52.625 --> 00:21:55.619
on the ground balance is not so
hard.

00:21:55.619 --> 00:21:58.906
Once you lift a foot off the
ground the other problem it

00:21:58.906 --> 00:22:02.318
introduces is balance.
It's much harder for me to stay

00:22:02.318 --> 00:22:06.274
stationary on one leg than it is
on two legs because gravity is

00:22:06.274 --> 00:22:10.039
acting on my body and trying to
pull me back down again.

00:22:10.039 --> 00:22:14.778
An additional problem arises
with this lifting up of one foot

00:22:14.778 --> 00:22:17.700
and that is the problem of
balance.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.838
How do we solve that?
We solve that by controlling

00:22:20.838 --> 00:22:25.584
our muscles, the muscles that
move us from side to side maybe,

00:22:25.584 --> 00:22:29.192
but that takes energy.
I want to move forward and

00:22:29.192 --> 00:22:32.574
the easiest way is to walk and
you probably didn't think about

00:22:32.574 --> 00:22:35.899
it when you were walking here
today but you're doing a fairly

00:22:35.899 --> 00:22:40.093
complicated set of operations.
You're lifting one foot off the

00:22:40.093 --> 00:22:43.800
ground to avoid gravity,
and you're letting it swing

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.958
forward.
The heel of your forward foot

00:22:46.958 --> 00:22:49.967
hits the ground,
your foot then moves,

00:22:49.967 --> 00:22:53.789
the toe of your back foot
leaves the ground,

00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:56.464
swings forward,
heel strike,

00:22:56.464 --> 00:22:59.238
toe lift, swing,
heel strike,

00:22:59.238 --> 00:23:03.686
toe lift, swing,
one foot's always on the ground

00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:06.411
when you walk.
You don't think about it but

00:23:06.411 --> 00:23:09.747
it's a fairly complicated motion
that you can do automatically

00:23:09.747 --> 00:23:11.732
now,
but if you do think about it

00:23:11.732 --> 00:23:15.223
when you're walking to your next
class, you'll notice that one

00:23:15.223 --> 00:23:21.281
foots always on the ground.
That helps you solve the

00:23:21.281 --> 00:23:27.315
problem of balance.
What else happens when

00:23:27.315 --> 00:23:31.870
you're doing this motion?
You might not notice it at all

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:36.152
but you're pelvis is actually
undergoing a fairly complicated

00:23:36.152 --> 00:23:39.761
set of movements.
I'm going to exaggerate it so

00:23:39.761 --> 00:23:43.334
you can't laugh.
If you watch somebody else walk

00:23:43.334 --> 00:23:47.776
or you put your hands on your
pelvic bone, the pelvic bone is

00:23:47.776 --> 00:23:52.440
this sort of girdle that both of
your hips are connected to,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:56.648
you've seen it on a skeleton.
When I lift up my leg then I'm

00:23:56.648 --> 00:23:59.750
tilting my pelvis up,
I'm tilting this side up in

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.269
order to get the leg off the
ground.

00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:05.468
I'm also bending my knee a
little bit to make my leg

00:24:05.468 --> 00:24:08.730
shorter, and I'm moving my foot
in order to allow,

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:11.303
when the toe lifts off,
allow it to swing without

00:24:11.303 --> 00:24:14.072
hitting the ground.
You don't want to hit the

00:24:14.072 --> 00:24:17.423
ground because of friction,
that would be a waste of

00:24:17.423 --> 00:24:19.924
energy,
you want to lift it just enough

00:24:19.924 --> 00:24:23.436
so that you clear the ground and
you do that by tilting your

00:24:23.436 --> 00:24:26.947
pelvis up and by bending your
knee a little and manipulating

00:24:26.947 --> 00:24:29.302
your foot.
You let that leg swing

00:24:29.302 --> 00:24:32.227
forward, the toe hits,
and now you're doing something

00:24:32.227 --> 00:24:34.927
else with your pelvis,
and that you're going like

00:24:34.927 --> 00:24:36.716
this.
You're not only lifting up to

00:24:36.716 --> 00:24:39.000
get it off the ground,
and then up on the other side,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.229
you're also twisting it like
this, so your pelvis twists,

00:24:43.229 --> 00:24:46.537
your pelvis tilts,
and it actually undergoes--if

00:24:46.537 --> 00:24:50.194
you could put a sort of--I'm
exaggerating it--not as much as

00:24:50.194 --> 00:24:53.913
others could but I'm trying to
exaggerate that your hips sort

00:24:53.913 --> 00:24:57.570
of go through a figure-eight
kind of motion as you're moving

00:24:57.570 --> 00:25:00.169
forward.
It's a fairly complicated

00:25:00.169 --> 00:25:04.377
motion that you do without even
thinking about it because you've

00:25:04.377 --> 00:25:08.184
done a lot of walking and you've
learned how to do it very

00:25:08.184 --> 00:25:12.089
efficiently.
Does this make sense?

00:25:12.089 --> 00:25:17.604
If you look at the
efficiency of walking you are

00:25:17.604 --> 00:25:22.470
creating forward motion,
you're creating it in

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:27.049
opposition to friction.
You're doing it by lifting a

00:25:27.049 --> 00:25:29.716
foot off the ground,
freeing it from friction,

00:25:29.716 --> 00:25:33.325
swinging it forward.
The cost is you had to spend

00:25:33.325 --> 00:25:37.013
some energy going up,
and then you recover that

00:25:37.013 --> 00:25:42.969
energy when you come back down.
What's energy called that you

00:25:42.969 --> 00:25:46.559
store as you move up?
Potential energy;

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:50.534
so one of the other things that
happens, if you notice somebody

00:25:50.534 --> 00:25:54.573
walking, and it's hard to notice
if you just see me walking like

00:25:54.573 --> 00:25:55.946
this,
maybe you can,

00:25:55.946 --> 00:25:59.416
but my head is actually moving
up and down when I walk because

00:25:59.416 --> 00:26:02.942
my center of gravity is rising
and falling as I pick my leg off

00:26:02.942 --> 00:26:05.864
the ground and let it swing.
You can't see that so

00:26:05.864 --> 00:26:08.119
easily when you're watching a
whole--have you ever seen

00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:10.625
somebody walk with a fence in
front of them and you see their

00:26:10.625 --> 00:26:12.630
head and it moves up and down a
little bit?

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.121
There's an inter-conversion
there between potential energy

00:26:16.121 --> 00:26:19.000
when I'm up and kinetic energy
when I'm down.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.170
I can exaggerate that way too
if I walk funny.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.743
You're putting some of your
energy into potential energy,

00:26:28.743 --> 00:26:31.259
creating potential energy with
your muscles,

00:26:31.259 --> 00:26:34.480
and then recovering that when
you come back down.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.900
The more of that you have to do
the more energy it takes.

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.745
These movements of the pelvis I
mentioned before sort of smooth

00:26:42.745 --> 00:26:46.901
out this up and down movement,
so you're not wasting so much

00:26:46.901 --> 00:26:51.020
energy going up and down,
you're mainly going forward.

00:26:54.309 --> 00:26:58.539
If you walked--did anybody
walk here with somebody?

00:26:58.539 --> 00:27:00.854
Did you walk by yourself or did
you walk in--anybody walk in a

00:27:00.854 --> 00:27:01.120
pair?

00:27:05.059 --> 00:27:08.242
Nobody wants to admit that they
walked some--well have you ever

00:27:08.242 --> 00:27:11.640
walked with somebody else?
Did you ever notice that

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.542
sometimes when you're walking
with somebody else they want to

00:27:16.542 --> 00:27:21.200
go faster than you or they want
to go slower than you?

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.918
Why is that?
Why do some people walk more

00:27:23.918 --> 00:27:24.910
slowly than others?

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.590
Why do some people walk more
quickly than others?

00:27:35.119 --> 00:27:37.609
Their legs are longer so their
bodies are shaped differently.

00:27:37.609 --> 00:27:41.580
So, they've figured out how to
make their walking efficient for

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.975
them and that means they've
figured out how to do this

00:27:44.975 --> 00:27:48.369
motion with their body in the
most efficient way.

00:27:48.369 --> 00:27:52.448
Now, why would longer legs
make it more efficient to move

00:27:52.448 --> 00:27:54.872
faster?
Well, because when you swing

00:27:54.872 --> 00:27:57.655
your leg you get a bigger bang
for the buck,

00:27:57.655 --> 00:28:01.150
you get farther with one
stride, that's part of it.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:05.549
The other part is that your
leg, when it's in this swing

00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:10.190
motion, behaves like another
object you probably studied in

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:14.946
physics, the pendulum.
You've seen pendulum's that

00:28:14.946 --> 00:28:20.397
swing, you notice that the
timing of pendulum's--anybody

00:28:20.397 --> 00:28:24.265
have a metronome?
Metronomes are pendulums like

00:28:24.265 --> 00:28:27.059
that, too, that have an
adjustable weight.

00:28:27.059 --> 00:28:29.859
If you move the weight one way
or the other,

00:28:29.859 --> 00:28:32.918
then the pendulum starts
swinging at a different

00:28:32.918 --> 00:28:36.587
frequency.
Depending on the length and

00:28:36.587 --> 00:28:39.958
weight of your leg,
as a pendulum,

00:28:39.958 --> 00:28:45.779
it has a natural frequency at
which it wants to swing.

00:28:45.779 --> 00:28:50.588
If I want to walk with the
least energy possible I want to

00:28:50.588 --> 00:28:53.803
just let my leg swing.
I don't want to put any energy

00:28:53.803 --> 00:28:56.539
into it, I'll put some energy
into lifting it off the ground,

00:28:56.539 --> 00:29:00.534
but once I lift it off it's
back here, what if I can just

00:29:00.534 --> 00:29:04.369
let it go and it swings forward?
That's the most efficient

00:29:04.369 --> 00:29:06.532
motion.
That motion would have a timing

00:29:06.532 --> 00:29:10.180
that depends on the size of your
body and the length of your leg,

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.464
and the weight of your leg,
and all the other

00:29:12.464 --> 00:29:14.799
characteristics that are
particular to you.

00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:18.155
If I want to walk slower than
my natural state,

00:29:18.155 --> 00:29:23.313
I have to slow something down.
My leg might swing forward fast

00:29:23.313 --> 00:29:27.354
with a certain distance.
In order for me to move slower

00:29:27.354 --> 00:29:29.529
I have to actually slow down my
leg.

00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:33.736
I have to slow down the swing
forward, that takes energy,

00:29:33.736 --> 00:29:37.795
it takes muscles to slow down,
and so sometimes you feel like,

00:29:37.795 --> 00:29:40.359
if you're walking more slowly
than you want to,

00:29:40.359 --> 00:29:43.380
that it's actually taking more
energy than it should.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.847
Likewise, if you have to walk
faster than your normal pace,

00:29:46.847 --> 00:29:50.315
it will seem like and will be
that you're using more energy

00:29:50.315 --> 00:29:51.930
than you would like to.

00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.813
Walking has an efficiency;
you can change your speed of

00:30:00.813 --> 00:30:02.420
course, you've learned how to do
that.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.858
If you plot on a graph,
like this one,

00:30:05.858 --> 00:30:11.341
this is a graph for a typical
person who's walking on a flat

00:30:11.341 --> 00:30:15.155
outdoor surface.
What it shows--the blue line

00:30:15.155 --> 00:30:19.205
there shows the efficiency,
or how much energy you use as a

00:30:19.205 --> 00:30:22.965
function of speed of walking,
how much energy you use as a

00:30:22.965 --> 00:30:25.606
function of speed.
So, there's a flat part at the

00:30:25.606 --> 00:30:27.480
beginning, not too much
different.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:32.741
If I'm below two miles an hour
walking it takes about the same

00:30:32.741 --> 00:30:35.699
amount of energy.
But as speed goes up,

00:30:35.699 --> 00:30:38.993
the energy consumption goes up.
You have to walk faster,

00:30:38.993 --> 00:30:41.987
faster than your natural
stride, and so you're using more

00:30:41.987 --> 00:30:45.195
energy maybe to swing your leg
forward faster so that you can

00:30:45.195 --> 00:30:46.582
walk.
You might even,

00:30:46.582 --> 00:30:49.594
if you start walking fast,
try this on your way to the

00:30:49.594 --> 00:30:52.890
next class or try to walk with
somebody and watch them,

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:55.730
as you walk faster your head's
going up and down more.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:31:00.321
You're taking advantage of this
potential kinetic transition to

00:31:00.321 --> 00:31:03.690
get more speed,
but the cost of that is that

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:07.760
you're moving body up and down
more and so that is less

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.680
efficient because movement up
and down is wasted.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:16.117
At a certain point,
you see the blue line goes up

00:31:16.117 --> 00:31:19.359
and up and up,
and it's exponential.

00:31:19.359 --> 00:31:21.609
If you--it starts to look
exponential.

00:31:21.609 --> 00:31:26.204
If you continue to try to walk
faster and faster it's going to

00:31:26.204 --> 00:31:29.970
eventually start to become
really uncomfortable.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:34.447
You're naturally going to want
to switch to a different form of

00:31:34.447 --> 00:31:38.967
motion and that's running.
Now, you can avoid that and you

00:31:38.967 --> 00:31:43.480
could try this yourself,
try walking faster and faster,

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.551
and faster and don't let
yourself run,

00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:48.685
just walk faster and faster,
and pretty soon you're doing

00:31:48.685 --> 00:31:51.820
the crazy kind of walk that
Olympic fast walkers do,

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.613
that feels very unnatural.
You might get a lot of speed

00:31:56.613 --> 00:32:02.216
but it feels very unnatural.
I'm not--you're kind of--can

00:32:02.216 --> 00:32:04.970
anybody do it?
You've seen it.

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:09.728
You're moving up and down a
lot, your pelvis is doing a very

00:32:09.728 --> 00:32:13.055
unusual pattern,
not the subtle movements that

00:32:13.055 --> 00:32:16.869
it does during normal walking,
but it's moving a lot more.

00:32:16.869 --> 00:32:20.473
That's what you notice,
the fast walkers they're moving

00:32:20.473 --> 00:32:23.742
from side to side,
they're pelvis is really moving

00:32:23.742 --> 00:32:25.971
a lot.
It becomes quite

00:32:25.971 --> 00:32:29.329
inefficient because you're
wasting energy.

00:32:29.329 --> 00:32:33.378
In fact, your body is telling
you to make the transition from

00:32:33.378 --> 00:32:36.261
walking into running.
If I want to move at this speed

00:32:36.261 --> 00:32:38.838
it's more efficient for me to
run, and that's what this graph

00:32:38.838 --> 00:32:41.908
shows you as well.
If you extended the walking

00:32:41.908 --> 00:32:45.684
line up a little bit,
at a speed of about 5 mph,

00:32:45.684 --> 00:32:49.460
running becomes more efficient
than walking.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.619
You can feel that transition if
you try to walk fast.

00:32:53.619 --> 00:32:56.282
There will become a point,
at about 5 mph,

00:32:56.282 --> 00:33:00.048
when you're going to want to
start to run because that will

00:33:00.048 --> 00:33:03.750
feel like a more efficient way
for your body to move.

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:06.810
Now, what is it that causes
that, mechanically,

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:10.828
that transition to take place?
What's different about running

00:33:10.828 --> 00:33:13.220
than walking?
Well, one of the things

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.408
that's different is that you
don't always have one foot on

00:33:16.408 --> 00:33:20.341
the ground when you're running.
In fact, if you watch somebody

00:33:20.341 --> 00:33:23.929
run or you run yourself,
you'll know that for a lot of

00:33:23.929 --> 00:33:28.059
the time you're only--you're
not--no foot's on the ground.

00:33:28.059 --> 00:33:30.324
There's not time that both feet
are on the ground,

00:33:30.324 --> 00:33:32.450
one foot hits,
you sort of bounce off of it,

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:36.479
you bounce off the other one,
you bounce off the other one,

00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:39.119
you're sort of hopping off one
foot.

00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:40.940
Try to do that slow it's really
hard.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.521
Why is that hard?
Because it's hard to balance on

00:33:44.521 --> 00:33:49.148
one foot, it's impossible to
balance on no feet when you are

00:33:49.148 --> 00:33:53.627
standing still.
As your speed increases you

00:33:53.627 --> 00:33:57.033
create inertia.
You create forward motion,

00:33:57.033 --> 00:34:01.029
and that forward motion or
inertia stabilizes your body.

00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:04.069
It makes balance less of an
issue.

00:34:04.069 --> 00:34:07.725
If you're moving forward at 5
mph, you're not worried about

00:34:07.725 --> 00:34:11.443
sideways motion so much because
you have this forward motion

00:34:11.443 --> 00:34:14.719
which is going to continue to
carry you forward,

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.780
and balance isn't so much of a
problem anymore.

00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:21.300
You can sacrifice having both
feet on the ground.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.811
You can even sacrifice having
any foot on the ground for some

00:34:25.811 --> 00:34:30.472
period and you'll just fly and
you'll fly forward no balance is

00:34:30.472 --> 00:34:33.171
required,
so you're not spending any

00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:36.345
energy on balance.
Running is sort of like

00:34:36.345 --> 00:34:39.610
flight in a way,
only it's very short flight.

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:45.340
It's like flying and hopping,
hopping on one foot.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:47.477
Also at that speed,
when you're moving at 5 mph,

00:34:47.477 --> 00:34:49.159
if you see somebody that's
running,

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:53.168
particularly an experienced
runner, and what makes

00:34:53.168 --> 00:34:57.750
experienced runners better than
inexperienced runners?

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:01.753
They've become more efficient
at doing this running motion and

00:35:01.753 --> 00:35:05.099
so they can move at fast speeds
very efficiently.

00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:08.156
One of the things you'll notice
in very efficient fast runners

00:35:08.156 --> 00:35:11.213
or good runners is that there's
very little up and down motion

00:35:11.213 --> 00:35:14.070
of their head even though
they're hopping and flying,

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:17.300
they're not moving up and down
very much.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.857
They've learned how to do this
without moving very much in the

00:35:20.857 --> 00:35:24.435
gravitational field,
keeping their center of gravity

00:35:24.435 --> 00:35:29.026
about the same which allows them
to convert all of their energy

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:33.199
into forward motion.
Does this make sense?

00:35:33.199 --> 00:35:40.099
There's another peculiar
thing on this slide and it's the

00:35:40.099 --> 00:35:45.673
black line, cycling.
If I told you that you had to

00:35:45.673 --> 00:35:52.286
move this afternoon at 12 mph to
get from here to somewhere else

00:35:52.286 --> 00:35:56.380
in New Haven in a couple of
minutes,

00:35:56.380 --> 00:36:00.124
most of you if you had the
choice would choose to use a

00:36:00.124 --> 00:36:03.800
bicycle to do that rather than
walking and running.

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:06.141
Particularly if you knew you
had to move that fast you'd pick

00:36:06.141 --> 00:36:08.729
a bicycle.
It won't be surprising for you

00:36:08.729 --> 00:36:13.180
to see that cycling is much more
efficient at higher speeds than

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.902
either walking or running,
so if I want to move 12 mph,

00:36:16.902 --> 00:36:19.590
cycling is much more efficient
than running;

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:22.589
walking is not even shown here
because it would be so much less

00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:25.623
efficient.
On the other hand it

00:36:25.623 --> 00:36:31.551
doesn't make obvious sense
because you're going to agree to

00:36:31.551 --> 00:36:34.880
move fast,
not with your--not only with

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:39.239
your body but with another thing
as well, which adds weight.

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:45.929
Even a very lightweight bicycle
weighs 30 lb.

00:36:45.929 --> 00:36:49.257
So, you're adding 30 lb to your
weight but you would gladly do

00:36:49.257 --> 00:36:52.748
that if you knew you had to move
fast because you know it's going

00:36:52.748 --> 00:36:55.497
to be efficient.
Why is cycling so much more

00:36:55.497 --> 00:36:58.849
efficient than running?
Well, one reason is when you're

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:01.760
cycling you're sort of a in a
constant profile.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.942
You're moving your legs but
your center of gravity stays

00:37:05.942 --> 00:37:09.440
relatively uniform,
very little up and down.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.868
All of your motion,
all of your energy that's

00:37:11.868 --> 00:37:14.960
created by your legs is
converted into forward motion.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:18.222
The other thing you know is
that now you have a

00:37:18.222 --> 00:37:21.941
mechanical--you have a machine
that's going to convert the

00:37:21.941 --> 00:37:25.986
energy of your legs efficiently
into motion of a wheel and that

00:37:25.986 --> 00:37:29.770
wheel overcomes friction very
efficiently by actually using

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:33.252
friction.
It's friction between the wheel

00:37:33.252 --> 00:37:37.843
and the ground that keeps the
bicycle stable and allows it to

00:37:37.843 --> 00:37:41.763
generate high speeds.
This machine allows you to

00:37:41.763 --> 00:37:45.690
overcome the problems of
friction and gravity very

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:50.659
smoothly, and so cycling is a
much more efficient activity.

00:37:50.659 --> 00:37:54.326
A lot has been written about
the biomechanics of cycling if

00:37:54.326 --> 00:37:57.360
you're interested in learning
more about that.

00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:03.389
Well, I want to talk about
swimming, another mode that we

00:38:03.389 --> 00:38:06.827
use, not everyday.
Some of you might swim

00:38:06.827 --> 00:38:11.500
everyday, most people don't.
Microorganisms that live in the

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:16.989
ocean, fish that live in water,
of course swim all the time.

00:38:16.989 --> 00:38:21.105
Swimming is their primary mode
of motion and they swim to get

00:38:21.105 --> 00:38:25.289
food, get away from danger,
reproduce, all of those things.

00:38:25.289 --> 00:38:30.795
What's the major problem that
you have to overcome when you

00:38:30.795 --> 00:38:33.298
swim?
Well, it's friction or drag,

00:38:33.298 --> 00:38:36.712
it's the same problem really
that all movement has to

00:38:36.712 --> 00:38:39.489
overcome,
but we're not thinking so much

00:38:39.489 --> 00:38:43.469
about friction on the Earth now
we're thinking more about the

00:38:43.469 --> 00:38:47.250
drag force that's created from
moving through a fluid.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:52.519
It's a bigger problem now
because the fluid is viscous.

00:38:52.519 --> 00:38:56.489
Air has a relatively low
viscosity;

00:38:56.489 --> 00:38:58.929
you know what viscosity is from
Tuesday's lecture.

00:38:58.929 --> 00:39:03.188
Air has a relatively low
viscosity, water has a higher

00:39:03.188 --> 00:39:08.010
viscosity, molasses or honey has
an even higher viscosity,

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:11.096
but it's harder to move through
water than it is through air

00:39:11.096 --> 00:39:14.275
because it's thicker,
it's harder to slip the plains

00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:17.832
of packets of water passed each
other to go back to the

00:39:17.832 --> 00:39:21.059
description I gave you of
viscosity last time.

00:39:21.059 --> 00:39:25.323
In fact, if you're going to
swim at a constant velocity,

00:39:25.323 --> 00:39:29.663
then you have to create a
propulsive force moving forward

00:39:29.663 --> 00:39:34.314
that is exactly opposite to the
drag force that is created by

00:39:34.314 --> 00:39:38.646
moving at that velocity.
Just like the example of

00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:41.585
putting your arms out of a
moving vehicle,

00:39:41.585 --> 00:39:45.355
which I don't recommend.
I'm sorry I'm using it as an

00:39:45.355 --> 00:39:48.894
example because we've all done
it but I don't recommend

00:39:48.894 --> 00:39:52.678
experiments of that kind.
Imagine that you're putting

00:39:52.678 --> 00:39:56.358
your hand out in water,
the same kind of thing would

00:39:56.358 --> 00:39:59.198
happen,
only the force would be even

00:39:59.198 --> 00:40:03.360
greater because of the greater
viscosity of the water.

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:07.137
You have to create a bigger
propulsive force in order to

00:40:07.137 --> 00:40:10.681
overcome this drag.
That's what fish have to do,

00:40:10.681 --> 00:40:14.360
that's what microorganisms that
swim have to do.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.131
Most microorganisms that
swim for a living or most fish

00:40:19.131 --> 00:40:23.491
that swim for a living have
evolved mechanisms to move

00:40:23.491 --> 00:40:27.769
quickly through water by
reducing their profile,

00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:30.660
so fish often have streamlined
shapes.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.590
They might be flat.
The look like flat plates

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:37.093
sometimes, some kinds of fish.
That's an easier shape,

00:40:37.093 --> 00:40:41.135
a more streamlined shape
creates less drag as it moves

00:40:41.135 --> 00:40:45.710
through water than a bulky shape
like a cube or a sphere.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:49.300
Streamlining or shape is an
adaptation that animals can use

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.596
in order to move faster.
You know this if you swim,

00:40:52.596 --> 00:40:56.099
if you want to swim and just
glide through the water,

00:40:56.099 --> 00:40:59.744
push off from the side and just
glide, if you go like this

00:40:59.744 --> 00:41:02.110
you're not going to glide very
far.

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:05.096
If you put your hands in front
of yourself or down at your side

00:41:05.096 --> 00:41:07.745
and make your body more
streamlined you're going to go a

00:41:07.745 --> 00:41:12.280
long ways,
so streamlining helps.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:16.402
It turns out that there's a
very simple relationship between

00:41:16.402 --> 00:41:20.067
the drag force and the velocity
that you move forward for

00:41:20.067 --> 00:41:23.470
objects that are spherical or
roughly spherical.

00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:28.734
I show that equation here.
The drag force is equal to 6 pi

00:41:28.734 --> 00:41:32.606
times the speed or the velocity
that you're moving times the

00:41:32.606 --> 00:41:35.137
viscosity,
times the size--and here the

00:41:35.137 --> 00:41:38.371
size would be the radius of the
sphere (F_d=6

00:41:38.371 --> 00:41:42.100
πvµr).
This equation applies to

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:45.048
spheres.
It applies very well to objects

00:41:45.048 --> 00:41:47.949
like microorganisms,
like bacteria that aren't

00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:51.946
entirely spherical but they're
not too different from spherical

00:41:51.946 --> 00:41:54.406
either.
If I am this bacterium and I

00:41:54.406 --> 00:41:57.959
want to move with a constant
speed, I have to create a force

00:41:57.959 --> 00:42:01.632
that exactly overcomes this drag
force that's created and that

00:42:01.632 --> 00:42:05.427
drag force depends on speed.
To move faster I have to

00:42:05.427 --> 00:42:09.192
overcome a bigger drag force,
I have to create more

00:42:09.192 --> 00:42:12.429
propulsive force just like the
airplane.

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:14.979
A fish the same thing,
in order for it to move forward

00:42:14.979 --> 00:42:17.192
at a certain speed,
it has to overcome the drag

00:42:17.192 --> 00:42:19.550
force and it does that by moving
its muscles,

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:23.429
by moving its flippers and fins
to create a propulsive force.

00:42:23.429 --> 00:42:26.985
What I did here is a simple
calculation between different

00:42:26.985 --> 00:42:29.753
kinds of swimmers.
Swimmers that are basically

00:42:29.753 --> 00:42:34.267
different in their size.
For a bacterium it's very

00:42:34.267 --> 00:42:40.361
small, its size is .0001 cm,
that's about 1 micron,

00:42:40.361 --> 00:42:46.311
so a very small object.
I asked the question how

00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:53.151
much--if I ask the question,
'How much drag force is created

00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:57.440
for it to move at a certain
speed?

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:00.998
' What was a reasonable speed?
I picked a speed of 10 body

00:43:00.998 --> 00:43:06.076
lengths /s;
10 body lengths /s would be a

00:43:06.076 --> 00:43:13.489
speed of .0001 cm/s,
so just multiply this by 10 /s.

00:43:13.489 --> 00:43:23.059
The viscosity of water is .01
centipoise or .01 g/(cm*s).

00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:25.841
If you knew these factors,
you knew how big the bacterium

00:43:25.841 --> 00:43:28.969
was, you knew the viscosity of
the medium it's going through,

00:43:28.969 --> 00:43:32.792
you knew how fast it was going
to move, you could plug into

00:43:32.792 --> 00:43:35.889
this equation and calculation
the drag force.

00:43:35.889 --> 00:43:40.001
If you calculated the drag
force, that's how much force

00:43:40.001 --> 00:43:43.960
that object has to be generating
in order to move.

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.750
You could do the same thing
for a fish.

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:48.295
Now, a fish is bigger,
let's just say lots of

00:43:48.295 --> 00:43:52.528
different sizes of fish.
Let's say a 10 cm fish moving

00:43:52.528 --> 00:43:57.514
through the same medium,
moves 10 body lengths /s that

00:43:57.514 --> 00:44:01.509
would be 100 cm/s.
A Yale student who wants to

00:44:01.509 --> 00:44:06.148
swim might have a size of about
170 cm, larger than the fish or

00:44:06.148 --> 00:44:10.681
the bacterium.
To move 10 body lengths /s,

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:16.360
I converted that to mph,
that's about 0.5 mph.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:23.059
I'm not a swimmer, is that fast?
Sounds fast;

00:44:23.059 --> 00:44:27.021
it's slower than you normally
walk, but you can't swim as fast

00:44:27.021 --> 00:44:29.302
as you can walk.
Let's just use that as an

00:44:29.302 --> 00:44:31.659
estimate and it's moving through
the same viscosity.

00:44:31.659 --> 00:44:35.612
One of the things that I asked
you to do in the homework for

00:44:35.612 --> 00:44:39.631
next week is to take this data
and sort of consider what life

00:44:39.631 --> 00:44:42.110
is like for a swimming
bacterium,

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:46.061
for a swimming fish,
for a swimming Yale student,

00:44:46.061 --> 00:44:48.860
just with these factors in
mind,

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.837
their sizes,
viscosity being the same,

00:44:51.837 --> 00:44:55.699
and their speeds of motion
somewhat different.

00:44:55.699 --> 00:45:00.589
You'll have a chance to think
about this quantitatively for

00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:04.719
next time and we'll come back to
it in section.

00:45:04.719 --> 00:45:07.954
I want to finish by talking
about another element of

00:45:07.954 --> 00:45:11.364
biomechanics that I hope I'm
able to talk a little bit more

00:45:11.364 --> 00:45:13.539
about a couple of weeks from
now.

00:45:13.539 --> 00:45:16.648
That's the issue of design in
biomechanics,

00:45:16.648 --> 00:45:20.941
and one of the main issues of
design in biomechanics is the

00:45:20.941 --> 00:45:24.789
design of artificial
replacements for joints like the

00:45:24.789 --> 00:45:27.439
hip.
Artificial hip replacements

00:45:27.439 --> 00:45:30.550
have now been around for
hundreds of years.

00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:34.564
W e are quite skilled at making
artificial hip replacements,

00:45:34.564 --> 00:45:37.489
surgeons are quite skilled at
doing them.

00:45:37.489 --> 00:45:41.674
A surgeon who does a lot of hip
replacements can do an operation

00:45:41.674 --> 00:45:45.573
like this in about an hour.
That includes taking your

00:45:45.573 --> 00:45:49.283
diseased hip out,
putting an artificial hip back

00:45:49.283 --> 00:45:53.940
in, and getting you to the
post-op all in about an hour.

00:45:53.940 --> 00:45:58.171
It's a pretty remarkable
achievement from the surgical

00:45:58.171 --> 00:46:00.118
side.
I want to show you a little

00:46:00.118 --> 00:46:02.940
bit about how these work from
the biomedical engineering side.

00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:06.225
To do that I first wanted to
show you the hip joint,

00:46:06.225 --> 00:46:08.480
which you might have seen
before.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:10.891
This is skeleton,
this is half of the pelvis I

00:46:10.891 --> 00:46:13.840
was talking about before,
it's motion during walking.

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.591
You see half of it here,
so this is the person's

00:46:16.591 --> 00:46:20.219
midline, this is the right hip,
the pelvis, the crest there.

00:46:20.219 --> 00:46:23.493
If you put your own fingers on
the sides of your hips,

00:46:23.493 --> 00:46:27.260
you can feel the bone that sort
of sticks out at the top about

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.397
where my belt lies here,
that's the crest of the ileum

00:46:30.397 --> 00:46:32.630
or one of the bones that makes
up the pelvis.

00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:34.737
For the experiment,
you're going to do while you're

00:46:34.737 --> 00:46:37.308
going to your next class where
you think about how your pelvis

00:46:37.308 --> 00:46:39.732
moves,
keep your fingers there that

00:46:39.732 --> 00:46:43.380
will be convenient and silly if
you walk that way.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.510
The hip is connected right
below that.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:50.392
You can feel--if you feel down
a little bit from the crest of

00:46:50.392 --> 00:46:54.210
your ileum, you can feel this
part of a long bone called the

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:58.469
femur that makes up the thigh.
It's the bone of your--the

00:46:58.469 --> 00:47:02.480
upper part of your leg.
That bone extends down to your

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:06.349
knee this way and it connects to
your pelvis this way,

00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:11.043
through a structure that's a
continuous structure of the bone

00:47:11.043 --> 00:47:14.719
called the femoral neck and the
femoral head.

00:47:14.719 --> 00:47:18.079
What it looks like is a neck
and a head.

00:47:18.079 --> 00:47:22.402
The head being sort of a ball
and the ball of the femur fits

00:47:22.402 --> 00:47:26.699
into a cup in the pelvis,
and it is this ball moving in

00:47:26.699 --> 00:47:30.780
this cup which gives your hip
its range of motion.

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:34.340
Your hip has remarkable range
of motion, you can move it all

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:37.333
different sorts of ways.
Not just forward and backward,

00:47:37.333 --> 00:47:38.900
but you can move it to the
side.

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:44.516
It's the ball moving in a cup
that creates all of this

00:47:44.516 --> 00:47:48.139
versatility of motion;
you can swing it around

00:47:48.139 --> 00:47:51.109
different ways.
Well, when this joint gets

00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:54.659
diseased, movement becomes much
more difficult.

00:47:54.659 --> 00:47:58.516
In general, it's a degenerative
disease that the bones and the

00:47:58.516 --> 00:48:04.025
cartilage start to break down,
and so now this cup and ball

00:48:04.025 --> 00:48:09.130
don't move so smoothly over one
another.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:13.151
When they don't move smoothly
over another,

00:48:13.151 --> 00:48:17.460
they generate friction,
they generate pain.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:23.838
So, degenerating hips can cause
tremendous amounts of pain for

00:48:23.838 --> 00:48:26.011
people.
What's in between these

00:48:26.011 --> 00:48:29.385
two--this is just a skeleton so
there's nothing in between these

00:48:29.385 --> 00:48:32.810
two,
but in our hips what is it that

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:39.109
lubricates the space between the
hip of the cup in the pelvis and

00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:43.550
the ball of the femur,
what lubricates that space?

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:48.778
Well, there's some fluid there,
but the main thing that

00:48:48.778 --> 00:48:53.909
lubricates it is protective
layer of cartilage or soft

00:48:53.909 --> 00:48:57.633
skeletal material.
Not bone but a soft spongy

00:48:57.633 --> 00:49:01.431
material that lubricates between
bones, and that can break down

00:49:01.431 --> 00:49:04.582
in diseases like arthritis.
Well, this is what an

00:49:04.582 --> 00:49:08.367
artificial hip looks like.
The modern hip is composed of

00:49:08.367 --> 00:49:12.940
two parts, there's a cup which
goes into your pelvis that

00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:17.840
replaces the normal structures
into which the femur goes.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:22.372
So, it replaces the cartilage
and the bony structure around

00:49:22.372 --> 00:49:25.420
the pelvis, and the end of the
femur,

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:29.300
the neck and the head are
replaced by a piece of metal.

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.001
The metal sets in the metal
ball of the femur,

00:49:33.001 --> 00:49:37.360
the artificial femur sets in
the cup of the pelvis.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:42.030
Now, what lubricates it now is
not cartilage but a polymer.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:45.286
Because if you had a metal cup
and a metal femur going in,

00:49:45.286 --> 00:49:47.628
metal on metal,
even if it was very smooth

00:49:47.628 --> 00:49:49.767
metal,
that's not--there's friction

00:49:49.767 --> 00:49:53.173
associated with that motion.
If you put a polymer,

00:49:53.173 --> 00:49:56.994
in particular,
what are used most often now is

00:49:56.994 --> 00:50:01.579
high density polyethylene or
something like Teflon,

00:50:01.579 --> 00:50:04.591
a metal ball slides very easily
over a Teflon cup,

00:50:04.591 --> 00:50:07.479
particularly if they're
machined to fit together

00:50:07.479 --> 00:50:10.359
precisely.
So that's what is used

00:50:10.359 --> 00:50:15.500
currently and what allows normal
motion to be restored.

00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:18.754
Now, the problem,
the main problem here is how to

00:50:18.754 --> 00:50:22.280
get this ball and this neck
attached to the femur.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.909
Because, if you think about it,
why is it metal?

00:50:24.909 --> 00:50:28.290
It's metal because if you're
standing on one leg all of the

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.679
weight of your body is on that
one leg.

00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:33.793
The whole weight of your body
is on the femur,

00:50:33.793 --> 00:50:37.530
the whole weight of the body is
actually right here.

00:50:37.530 --> 00:50:41.413
The whole weight of your body
is on this very small--depends

00:50:41.413 --> 00:50:45.099
on the integrity of that very
small piece of material.

00:50:45.099 --> 00:50:47.371
What we learned last time
is that materials have

00:50:47.371 --> 00:50:49.877
elasticity.
You don't want something that

00:50:49.877 --> 00:50:52.272
bends a lot there.
You want something that's

00:50:52.272 --> 00:50:54.853
strong, that doesn't bend,
even when there's a high stress

00:50:54.853 --> 00:50:57.570
applied to it like the stress of
the weight of your body.

00:50:57.570 --> 00:51:02.007
Metals are really the materials
that best can supply that kind

00:51:02.007 --> 00:51:05.571
of mechanical strength,
that kind of resistance to

00:51:05.571 --> 00:51:10.090
bending, resistance to fracture.
The problem is how to get this

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:12.243
on here.
The way that that's solved,

00:51:12.243 --> 00:51:15.469
currently, is to have the neck
and the ball of the femur

00:51:15.469 --> 00:51:18.050
attached to a much longer piece
of metal.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:22.144
When you get an artificial hip,
then this part of the new

00:51:22.144 --> 00:51:26.239
replacement femur goes down into
the bone of your leg,

00:51:26.239 --> 00:51:31.300
inserted into the bone so that
it's more stable.

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:35.679
There's all of this metal into
your bone to sort of stabilize

00:51:35.679 --> 00:51:38.380
it because the last thing you
want,

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:43.618
or what you want to achieve,
is for this part of the femur

00:51:43.618 --> 00:51:49.039
to move without any slippage
with the rest of your femur.

00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:52.433
I'm going to come back to this
concept later and talk more when

00:51:52.433 --> 00:51:55.717
we talk about artificial organs
about how artificial hips are

00:51:55.717 --> 00:51:58.175
made,
but I wanted you to at least

00:51:58.175 --> 00:52:02.106
have a picture of how this
particular piece of biomedical

00:52:02.106 --> 00:52:05.139
engineering works.
We'll see you at section this

00:52:05.139 --> 00:52:06.139
afternoon.

J. MICHAEL MCBRIDE : So we're
going to finish up talking about

00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:10.600
aromaticity, talking then about
reactions, as well as 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.367
molecules that are unusually
stable. 

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:17.233
That is, transition states that
are stabilized, that's 

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:21.867
Diels-Alder reactions which are
cycloadditions, and also 

00:00:21.867 --> 00:00:26.567
other pericyclic reactions like
electrocyclic reactions. 

00:00:26.567 --> 00:00:30.267
Then we'll go on to
spectroscopy. 

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:33.967
OK, so we're generalizing the
concept of aromaticity. 

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:37.167
We saw last time that Hueckel
thought there would be unusual 

00:00:37.167 --> 00:00:44.333
stability when you add 4n+2 pi
electrons in a ring 

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:48.267
that is, when you have an odd
number of electron pairs, 

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:52.100
because every odd numbered
orbital goes down in energy 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.367
when you form a ring. 

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:56.400
So if there's an odd number in
total, they're more 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.900
going down that up. 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.333
And then we'll go on to see as I
said about transition-state 

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:03.100
aromaticity. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.433
So first just one slides that
will be on the exam on Monday, 

00:01:06.433 --> 00:01:11.833
it's fair game anyhow, which is
some things that are not 

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:15.167
benzenoid, but are still
aromatic. 

00:01:15.167 --> 00:01:18.900
Like cyclopentadiene, of course,
is a ring, but it's 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.533
not a ring of conjugated p
orbitals because there's one 

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:25.267
intervening one, so the terminal
p orbitals of the 

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:29.700
diene don't interact, don't
overlap with one another. 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.500
But if you pull off the protons
with a 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.733
base, then they interact. 

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:36.467
So now you have five electrons--

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:39.033
this anion in the pi system-- 

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.667
and it's unusually stable. 

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.967
You could pull off that hydrogen
from 

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:46.533
a carbon with hydroxide. 

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.900
The pKa of this compound is 15.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.333
It's more acidic then water is.

00:01:51.333 --> 00:01:55.067
It's better to pull a hydrogen
off that carbon then to pull a 

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:56.733
hydrogen off oxygen. 

00:01:56.733 --> 00:02:02.167
Now what's the normal pKa for
pulling a 

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:04.100
hydrogen off carbon? 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.133
Do you remember? 

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.967
STUDENT: About 50? 

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:08.567
PROFESSOR: Pardon me? 

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:10.267
STUDENT: It is about 50. 

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:11.000
PROFESSOR: It's about 50. 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.767
Of course, this is allylic. 

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:16.033
And in fact it's doubly allylic,
so you might 

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:17.467
say that helps out. 

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.500
No doubt it does help out. 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.167
But notice that it has 6 pi
electrons, same as benzene, 

00:02:23.167 --> 00:02:25.833
and we would expect on the basis
of our theory for it to 

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:27.600
be unusually stable. 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.400
But if it's just that it's
allylic. Think about doing the 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.767
same thing with the 7-membered
ring. 

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:36.933
If you pulled the hydrogen off
the CH2 here of a 

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:39.567
7-membered ring, you get this
anion. Which would be 

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:42.333
stabilized by that resonance
structure, that one, that one, 

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:44.667
that one, that one, that one--
an enormous number of 

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:50.200
resonance structures, but the
pKa is 39. 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.367
It's 10^24 less acidic than the
one on the 5-membered 

00:02:57.367 --> 00:03:00.267
ring-- even though you can draw
many fewer-- only five 

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.133
resonance structures in that
case. 

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.467
So it's not a question of
resonance structures. 

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:07.867
It's a question of how many
electron pairs 

00:03:07.867 --> 00:03:09.100
there are in that ring. 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.300
And if it's an odd number it's
stable, and if it's an even 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.900
number of pairs, then it's not
stable. 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.733
So that one has 8 pi electrons--

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:18.933
4n. 

00:03:18.933 --> 00:03:23.067
It's antiaromatic instead of
being aromatic. 

00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:28.400
Another interesting analogue is
cyclopropene. 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.900
So here's a case of cyclopropene
reacting with an 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.933
unusually stable cation,
triphenylmethyl cation. 

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:40.033
Notice that that cation is
triply benzylic. 

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.667
There are three benzene rings
that helps stabilize the 

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:43.800
positive charge 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.767
or to speak more accurately,
who's electrons are stabilize 

00:03:47.767 --> 00:03:50.800
by the vacant orbital on carbon.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.167
Still, it's exothermic to
transfer the hydride-- 

00:03:57.167 --> 00:04:00.833
notice it's a hydride not a
proton pulling off H minus 

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:05.467
this onto the phenyl-CH3
[correction: Phenyl3CH]

00:04:05.467 --> 00:04:07.167
to generate this cyclic

00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:09.233
conjugated cation. 

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:12.667
So that one is even more stable
then the unusually 

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:15.467
stable triply benzylic one. 

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:20.567
Now what's the accounting of
that one? 

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:23.600
The accounting of pi electrons?

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.933
Ruoyi, can you tell me how many
pi electrons in a ring of 

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.500
that cation? 

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:36.700
Is it going to conform to 4n+2?

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.100
PROFESSOR: OK, we had a double
bond, that's two electrons and 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.467
what do we get from that center
when we pull off H 

00:04:43.467 --> 00:04:47.500
minus in the p orbital? 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.200
STUDENT: Zero. 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.333
PROFESSOR: So, how many do we
have? 

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:50.600
STUDENT: Two. 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.733
PROFESSOR: Two. 

00:04:50.733 --> 00:04:53.000
Is that 4n+2, where n is an
integer? 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.267
STUDENT: n is zero. 

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:56.067
PROFESSOR: Yes, it's when n is
zero. 

00:04:56.067 --> 00:04:58.133
So that one you expect to be
unusually stable. 

00:04:58.133 --> 00:05:01.267
It's just got the one pair that
goes down in energy when 

00:05:01.267 --> 00:05:02.700
you form a ring. 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.467
Two pi electrons is 4n+2. 

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:09.267
And notice that now if you go to
C7, here we went in the 

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:16.600
anion to C7H8, pardon me, C7H7
anion. 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.533
Here to C7H7 cation, if we do
the same trick with that, 

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:28.267
react this hydrocarbon with that
triphenylmethyl cation. 

00:05:28.267 --> 00:05:30.167
And that is also the same. 

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:31.433
That's also downhill. 

00:05:31.433 --> 00:05:33.467
It's favorable to make this. 

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:37.067
Does that conform to 4n+2? 

00:05:37.067 --> 00:05:39.700
What do you say, Rahul? 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.267
How many pi electrons in C7 H7
plus? 

00:05:43.267 --> 00:05:44.567
STUDENT: Six. 

00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:45.867
PROFESSOR: Six. 

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:49.667
4n+2, same as benzene. 

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:53.000
So here are some really weird
compounds, that you wouldn't 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.133
expect to be so unusually
stable, that are because it's a

00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:59.367
generalization of the idea of
aromaticity. 

00:05:59.367 --> 00:06:03.500
But it applies not only to
ground states but also to 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.633
transition states. When you get
a ring that has a conjugation 

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:11.400
among a bunch of orbitals where
the number of 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.200
electronics is 4n+2. 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:17.100
So in this case the transition
states are aromatic, even 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.100
though the starting material and
the 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.500
products are not aromatic. 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.000
What that means is that there's
special stability only 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.067
in the transition state, and
therefore the reactions will 

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:29.767
be unusually easy. 

00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:31.600
So let's see if we have some
example of that. 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.500
We'll look at cycloadditons, in
particular, that 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.500
Diels-Alder reaction and also an
electrocyclic reactions. 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.633
We'll start with the
cycloadditions. 

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:43.833
So that Diels-Alder reaction was
the subject of a Nobel 

00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:48.533
prize, surprisingly enough to
Diels and Alder. 

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:52.067
It involved a diene reacting
with an alkene. 

00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:56.533
So an ene and a diene and they
react with one another was 

00:06:56.533 --> 00:07:00.367
three pairs of electrons
shifting to form a ring. 

00:07:00.367 --> 00:07:05.733
So it has four sigma electrons
that are involved in this, and 

00:07:05.733 --> 00:07:08.300
2 pi electrons in the product. 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.100
In the starting material, it's 4
pi 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:12.933
electrons and 2 pi electrons. 

00:07:12.933 --> 00:07:14.967
It's six electrons, three pairs,

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:16.367
that are being involved. 

00:07:16.367 --> 00:07:19.400
And we can write curbed arrows
like that, but we might want 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.400
to think about it a little more
carefully. 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.433
Suppose we just draw the two
approaching one another, HOMO 

00:07:24.433 --> 00:07:27.667
to LUMO like that. 

00:07:27.667 --> 00:07:30.267
Now there are two problems here.

00:07:30.267 --> 00:07:34.233
One is that we've got the LUMO
drawn upside down. 

00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:37.200
In fact, there are three
problems. That we can just 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.967
write the signs the other way,
that's no problem. 

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:42.533
Another problem is that the
hydrogens which we haven't 

00:07:42.533 --> 00:07:45.800
shown, the sigma hydrogens are
going to be running into one 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.767
another when we do that. 

00:07:48.767 --> 00:07:52.133
And there's also another
problem. 

00:07:52.133 --> 00:07:55.867
Somehow, pi electrons have to
become sigma 

00:07:55.867 --> 00:07:58.000
electrons here and here. 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.733
It has to be an end on, not a pi
interaction 

00:08:02.733 --> 00:08:04.100
in order to do that. 

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.867
How can we get around these
problems? 

00:08:06.867 --> 00:08:07.600
Yes. 

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.533
STUDENT: Rotate the ene. 

00:08:09.533 --> 00:08:12.333
PROFESSOR: OK, we can rotate the
ene 180 degrees. 

00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:16.267
That'll make the signs correct.

00:08:16.267 --> 00:08:18.100
How do we get around the other
problems, let's say the 

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.233
hydrogens running into one
another? 

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.667
STUDENT: 90 degrees. 

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:25.100
PROFESSOR: If we rotated it at
90 degrees that's true, but 

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.967
you don't get the best overlap
that way for 

00:08:26.967 --> 00:08:28.433
forming a new bond. 

00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:30.933
Anybody else got an idea? 

00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:31.867
Brandon? 

00:08:31.867 --> 00:08:33.333
STUDENT: Can we just move it
under? 

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:34.800
PROFESSOR: Put it under. 

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:40.567
So make the approach where the
p is parallel to the direction

00:08:40.567 --> 00:08:42.533
of the p axes like. 

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.733
Now we got around all those
problems. So we can form this 

00:08:48.733 --> 00:08:51.600
new-- but notice the transition
state is folded 

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.233
because of this, because they're
not coming 

00:08:53.233 --> 00:08:54.500
together in a plane. 

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.167
So to see the product then we
have to unfold it. 

00:08:57.167 --> 00:09:00.167
We have to grab that bottom
black line and pull 

00:09:00.167 --> 00:09:02.133
it up into the plane. 

00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:04.700
So the product is then going to
look like that, once we 

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:05.267
flatten it. 

00:09:05.267 --> 00:09:07.667
You can see the new bonds that
will form. 

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:10.900
Now let's think a little bit
about what we would predict in 

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.467
connection with stereochemistry
in this. 

00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:17.733
Suppose the starting alkene were
of a Z configuration. 

00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:21.100
Suppose it had two methyl groups
on it. 

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.633
Then if you form those two bonds
at once, they'll still 

00:09:24.633 --> 00:09:27.967
be cis here, and they'll be
cis in the 

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:31.233
product in methyl groups. 

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:32.733
How about the diene? 

00:09:32.733 --> 00:09:37.200
Suppose, the diene had the E,
Z configuration, so methyl 

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:41.100
that's cis here and
trans here.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.467
Then if we look at the
transition state, it'll be 

00:09:43.467 --> 00:09:46.900
still cis here and trans here.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.567
And if we flattened that out,
where will the methyls be in 

00:09:49.567 --> 00:09:50.833
the product? 

00:09:50.833 --> 00:09:54.333
How about there's going to be a
methyl here on that carbon, 

00:09:54.333 --> 00:09:57.067
is it going to be pointing
toward you or away when you 

00:09:57.067 --> 00:09:58.567
flatten the ring out? 

00:09:58.567 --> 00:10:01.133
If this is the way it is in the
transition state, try to 

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:05.233
think of a mechanically, we
break this bond. 

00:10:05.233 --> 00:10:08.767
Is that going to be when we pull
this up and flatten it 

00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:12.833
out-- is that methyl going to be
coming up toward us or back 

00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:14.067
into the board? 

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:26.500
This is a kind of mechanical
thinking that maybe-- we used 

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.533
to require people to buy models,
you've seen those. And that

00:10:30.533 --> 00:10:34.767
probably helped with this
mechanical perception.

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:37.700
How many think when you flatten,
and when you pull this 

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.800
up the methyl there is going to
be pointing towards you? 

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.900
How many think it's going to be
pointing away? 

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.333
That's reassuring that the vast
majority 

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:50.567
are right in this. 

00:10:50.567 --> 00:10:52.767
It's coming toward you. 

00:10:52.767 --> 00:10:56.367
So you can look at this in the
privacy of your room maybe use 

00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:59.100
toothpicks and grapes or
something to make a model and 

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.633
see how it twists like that. 

00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:04.867
Now, how about this one when you
fold this up? 

00:11:04.867 --> 00:11:08.333
What's it going to be at the
bottom carbon? 

00:11:08.333 --> 00:11:10.500
How many think it's going to be
pointing toward you? 

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.467
Have the courage of your
conviction. 

00:11:16.467 --> 00:11:19.667
How many think it's going to be
pointing away? 

00:11:19.667 --> 00:11:21.967
The aways have it. 

00:11:21.967 --> 00:11:25.133
Democracy wins again, Debby. 

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:27.333
It's away in that case. 

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:29.967
So you have a little practice to
think about 

00:11:29.967 --> 00:11:31.200
how such things work. 

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.800
And they'll be more of these as
we go along here. 

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.167
So those two methyls will be
trans preserving the kind of 

00:11:38.167 --> 00:11:40.767
relation they had in the
starting material through that 

00:11:40.767 --> 00:11:43.200
particular transition state. 

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.867
Now is that true? 

00:11:45.867 --> 00:11:47.733
So here we take a methyl-- 

00:11:47.733 --> 00:11:50.400
first we'll look at
regiochemistry, and then we're 

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.067
going to look at
stereochemistry. 

00:11:52.067 --> 00:11:57.233
So regiochemistry first. So now
we can imagine this diene, 

00:11:57.233 --> 00:12:02.167
the methyl substituted diene. To
be either approaching this 

00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:03.800
way or to be upside down. 

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.967
It could be either way. 

00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:08.767
So we're going to slide it over
the top of the other one 

00:12:08.767 --> 00:12:10.900
like that and make the new
bonds. 

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.967
And notice in this case, once we
unfold it-- to unfold it, 

00:12:14.967 --> 00:12:18.033
we're going to have to grab this
bond. It's in the form of 

00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:20.400
a U. When it makes those new
bonds on the 

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.600
left, see like that. 

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:23.400
One is on top: 

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.067
one's on the bottom. 

00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:25.833
They made these new bonds here.

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:28.967
And we're going to have to
unfold it like that to draw a 

00:12:28.967 --> 00:12:32.633
normal picture of it. 

00:12:32.633 --> 00:12:35.233
And when we do that this methyl
group is going 

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:36.067
to come over here. 

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:38.933
That is the new blue double bond
is here on the right, but 

00:12:38.933 --> 00:12:40.800
when we grab and pull it out to
the left 

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.533
it's going to be there. 

00:12:42.533 --> 00:12:46.533
So spacial perception is
entering into the-- 

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:49.733
is raising its ugly head now. 

00:12:49.733 --> 00:12:52.400
And in this case when we fold it
out. The methyl is obviously 

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:54.467
going to be down. 

00:12:54.467 --> 00:12:57.333
Now, in fact, those two products
form. 

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:02.000
9% of this and 45% of this. 

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.867
Now why is there's so much more
of this transition state 

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:07.167
than of that transition state? 

00:13:07.167 --> 00:13:13.067
Incidentally, notice that the
diene is not only over this 

00:13:13.067 --> 00:13:17.467
double bond, it's also as close
as it can be to the CO 

00:13:17.467 --> 00:13:18.767
double bond. 

00:13:18.767 --> 00:13:21.000
There's a secondary interaction
of the orbitals 

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.167
that makes it go that way,
that's called endo 

00:13:23.167 --> 00:13:27.700
orientation, but don't worry
about that. 

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.167
I struggled here, how to do
this, to 

00:13:30.167 --> 00:13:31.833
make it look realistic. 

00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:33.333
That's the way it really does. 

00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:35.467
Most people wouldn't draw that
way. They'd draw it 

00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:39.333
approaching just the diene here,
and the 

00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:40.467
alkene on the right. 

00:13:40.467 --> 00:13:42.400
And this would come in, and that
would come in, and they 

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.367
would draw the new bonds. 

00:13:44.367 --> 00:13:47.433
But really it approaches above,
and I think that's 

00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:47.967
interesting. 

00:13:47.967 --> 00:13:50.733
So that's why I took the trouble
to draw it that way. 

00:13:50.733 --> 00:13:54.133
But when you do that, you notice
that the diene could be 

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:56.667
either such that it's close to
the CO2 or it 

00:13:56.667 --> 00:13:57.800
could be out here. 

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.600
So it if you look at it from the
top, it can either be a U 

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.967
or it could be an S. And it
prefers to be a U to have the 

00:14:06.967 --> 00:14:09.867
diene closer to the carbonyl. 

00:14:09.867 --> 00:14:14.133
So given that that's true, why
might you expect to get rather 

00:14:14.133 --> 00:14:16.300
little of this and more of the
bottom stuff. 

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.467
Any ideas? 

00:14:18.467 --> 00:14:19.067
Ayesha? 

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:23.267
STUDENT: Is it because they're
approaching the CO group and 

00:14:23.267 --> 00:14:24.167
the CH3, they're sterically
hindered? 

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, even though the
diene is attractive to 

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.533
that group on the bottom which
is why it's formed into a U 

00:14:31.533 --> 00:14:34.667
rather than an S-- you would
also have it 

00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:36.167
close in this case, 

00:14:36.167 --> 00:14:40.033
but in the case on top, you have
those two methyls on top 

00:14:40.033 --> 00:14:40.967
of one another. 

00:14:40.967 --> 00:14:44.667
So it looks like steric
hindrance could explain this. 

00:14:44.667 --> 00:14:47.367
But there's another possibility
as well. 

00:14:47.367 --> 00:14:49.433
Perhaps, there's an
intermediate. 

00:14:49.433 --> 00:14:54.433
Perhaps, one bond forms first in
the rate-determining step, 

00:14:54.433 --> 00:14:57.867
and then a second bond forms,
and you have this intermediate 

00:14:57.867 --> 00:15:01.933
which on this side is anion
adjacent to a carbonyl group. 

00:15:01.933 --> 00:15:03.800
So that is an enolate. 

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.833
And on the left it's allylic
because we can draw our 

00:15:07.833 --> 00:15:09.600
resonance structure of that. 

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.033
Now if that were true, if you
had this intermediate, why 

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:17.933
might you predict getting more
of this than of this? 

00:15:17.933 --> 00:15:19.433
More of the stuff on the bottom.

00:15:19.433 --> 00:15:22.800
Why is the one of the bottom a
better allylic intermediate? 

00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:32.367
Mary, do you have any idea? 

00:15:32.367 --> 00:15:34.767
The only difference between the
allyl on the top and the 

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:37.767
allyl on the bottom is where the
methyl is. 

00:15:37.767 --> 00:15:40.533
In the top, it's on the middle
carbon. 

00:15:40.533 --> 00:15:42.633
In the bottom, it's on a
terminal 

00:15:42.633 --> 00:15:45.167
carbon on the double bond. 

00:15:45.167 --> 00:15:46.467
Let's think about the resonance

00:15:46.467 --> 00:15:48.133
structure you would draw. 

00:15:48.133 --> 00:15:50.100
Mary, were you about to say
something? 

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.267
STUDENT: Oh, I was going to say

00:15:52.267 --> 00:15:53.167
more substituted alkenes-- 

00:15:53.167 --> 00:15:54.500
PROFESSOR: Aha! 

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.500
In that resonance structure this
methyl is stabilizing 

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.600
that cation. 

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.000
Not in this case, when it's on
the middle carbon because the 

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.533
allylic charges on one end or
the other. 

00:16:05.533 --> 00:16:08.767
So one could say that this is a
more stable intermediate 

00:16:08.767 --> 00:16:10.033
and, therefore, you get that. 

00:16:10.033 --> 00:16:14.033
Or it could just be that the
transition state is a little 

00:16:14.033 --> 00:16:17.000
unsymmetrical the way we showed
in other cases, where a 

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.567
bridge thing like mercury wasn't
in the middle but a 

00:16:19.567 --> 00:16:21.833
little toward one side. 

00:16:21.833 --> 00:16:25.833
So it could just be that both
bonds form at once, but not 

00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:28.633
precisely in step with one
another, one a little more 

00:16:28.633 --> 00:16:29.967
than the other. 

00:16:29.967 --> 00:16:33.233
If it went through an
intermediate, there's a test 

00:16:33.233 --> 00:16:36.200
for it to see whether there's an
intermediate. 

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.900
Because if you have an
intermediate then you would 

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.933
imagine that it could rotate
here. 

00:16:43.933 --> 00:16:47.467
So this could move over here
before it formed a new bond. 

00:16:47.467 --> 00:16:51.700
Or indeed, this one could rotate
around this bond and bring 

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.467
that, instead of on the top
where it is now, on the bottom 

00:16:55.467 --> 00:16:56.700
as it approaches this one. 

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:59.300
So we could have these rotations
that would change 

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.067
the stereochemistry of the
product. 

00:17:02.067 --> 00:17:04.100
So we can test that. 

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:06.800
So let's look at the
stereochemistry of the ene. 

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.833
Now we've put two of these
groups on, and they're cis to 

00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:11.633
one another. 

00:17:11.633 --> 00:17:15.533
And if we put that on top, and
make the new bonds, and then 

00:17:15.533 --> 00:17:19.367
fold it back, grab this new
double bond, the one here and 

00:17:19.367 --> 00:17:24.000
fold it back, we see that these
two groups will be 

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.633
adjacent to one another- cis. 

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:29.100
So we'd expect a cis product.
When we form 

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.133
those new red bonds. 

00:17:32.133 --> 00:17:37.000
So a cis alkene should give a
cis cyclohexene, and that, in 

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.967
fact, forms in 68% yield. 

00:17:40.967 --> 00:17:45.100
If you take the other
stereoisomer of the alkene, 

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:51.900
the trans one, and do the
same trick you get the trans

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.600
cyclohexene, and that one in 84%
yield. 

00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.800
And this is what you actually
isolate and can 

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.033
sell to your neighbor. 

00:18:07.467 --> 00:18:09.133
You don't form the wrong isomer.

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:10.600
So it doesn't rotate. 

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.267
So there's not an intermediate.

00:18:13.267 --> 00:18:15.767
So the diene just sits down on
the ene. 

00:18:15.767 --> 00:18:19.133
It forms the two sigma bonds
simultaneously from the same 

00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:22.600
face right from the top here. 

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.567
So there's no rotatable
intermediate with only one new 

00:18:25.567 --> 00:18:26.767
sigma bond. 

00:18:26.767 --> 00:18:28.600
So you didn't have this
situation 

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.400
where you could rotate. 

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.000
So it's a concerted reaction. 

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.367
you form both bonds at once. 

00:18:36.367 --> 00:18:39.167
Now, how about with respect to
the diene stereochemistry? 

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:43.000
Here we have E and E, the
trans arrangements around 

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.533
those two double bonds. 

00:18:44.533 --> 00:18:49.100
So we put those on top, form the
new bonds, and you see 

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.767
that now, as drawn here, the
product, in 81% yield, has 

00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:56.100
everything cis. 

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.100
This carbon, this carbon, this
carbon, and this carbon. 

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.833
Now these two carbons in the
ring being cis to one another 

00:19:02.833 --> 00:19:05.400
are not surprising you couldn't
make those trans that 

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.067
would be to strained. 

00:19:08.067 --> 00:19:14.367
But that they are cis to these
says that this had to be in 

00:19:14.367 --> 00:19:17.300
the U form here, not the S form.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:23.233
And that these are both up shows
that you formed both 

00:19:23.233 --> 00:19:25.333
bonds at once as shown here. 

00:19:25.333 --> 00:19:29.133
And this is another place for
you to sit in your room. And 

00:19:29.133 --> 00:19:32.600
think about how these things
will unfold. And what points 

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.833
and what direction. 

00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:48.567
Now if you take this E-Z
isomer. And do the same trick, 

00:19:48.567 --> 00:19:51.467
then in 15 hours at a 150
degrees you get this to be 

00:19:51.467 --> 00:19:54.433
trans, instead of cis. 

00:19:54.433 --> 00:19:57.200
But notice the difference in
conditions. 

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:00.767
This one happens in 5 minutes at
a 120 degrees. 

00:20:00.767 --> 00:20:05.500
This one takes 15 hours at a
much higher temperature, 30 

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:08.133
degrees Celsius hotter. 

00:20:08.133 --> 00:20:09.767
So there's something wrong,
something is 

00:20:09.767 --> 00:20:13.533
slow about this reaction. 

00:20:13.533 --> 00:20:15.067
Now, can we figure out what
might be 

00:20:15.067 --> 00:20:17.100
slow about that reaction. 

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.933
Why might it be bad to come in
and do this. 

00:20:26.267 --> 00:20:29.000
Notice that the hydrogen and the
methyl are near one 

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
another. When we have the
rotation around this single 

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.133
bond so that these are adjacent
to one another. 

00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:41.533
So it would prefer the s-trans
conformation. 

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:44.433
S means the single bond in
a diene

00:20:44.433 --> 00:20:46.167
between two double bonds. 

00:20:46.167 --> 00:20:50.700
So it could be s-cis or s-trans.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:54.033
So this prefers to be s-trans,
but to do the Diels-Alder 

00:20:54.033 --> 00:20:57.233
reaction it has to be cis so
those terminal carbons could 

00:20:57.233 --> 00:21:00.367
be near the same ene. 

00:21:00.367 --> 00:21:03.567
So because it prefers to be this
way, it's much harder. 

00:21:03.567 --> 00:21:07.067
You have to put in extra energy
to make it s-cis, as 

00:21:07.067 --> 00:21:08.333
well as to do the reaction. 

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.267
Now just to show you some of the
variety of the Diels-Alder 

00:21:15.267 --> 00:21:17.867
reaction, it's not just simple
compounds like the ones we 

00:21:17.867 --> 00:21:20.767
showed here, you can use the
acetylenes. 

00:21:20.767 --> 00:21:23.667
So we do that trick in this one
at 150 

00:21:23.667 --> 00:21:25.967
degrees you get a diene-- 

00:21:25.967 --> 00:21:28.100
a cyclohexadiene product. 

00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:31.033
Because acetylene, when it loses
one of its bonds, 

00:21:31.033 --> 00:21:35.033
becomes an ene not a single
bond. 

00:21:35.033 --> 00:21:39.800
Or you can have a ring involved
like this. 

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:44.167
And notice that that's the
product, and it happens very 

00:21:44.167 --> 00:21:47.367
fast at 1M concentration, the 

00:21:47.367 --> 00:21:47.967
half-life-- 

00:21:47.967 --> 00:21:49.367
or the equivalent of a
half-life-- 

00:21:49.367 --> 00:21:54.033
is a second at room
temperature-- 

00:21:54.033 --> 00:21:55.400
actually below room temperature.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:02.867
So have you ever seen a skeleton
like that before? 

00:22:02.867 --> 00:22:04.500
Let me draw it a little
differently. 

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.300
Yeah, Rahul? 

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:08.233
STUDENT: The Ziegler-Natta,
or umm...

00:22:08.233 --> 00:22:09.333
PROFESSOR: Yes, it's two names.

00:22:09.333 --> 00:22:12.400
STUDENT: The metathesis with...

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.933
PROFESSOR: Right, this is the
starting material when it had 

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:18.333
hydrogens there for the
metathesis polymerization-- 

00:22:18.333 --> 00:22:20.167
the ring-opening metathesis. 

00:22:20.167 --> 00:22:22.300
That's actually absolutely true,
but I was thinking of an 

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:23.667
earlier example of it. 

00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:24.000
Yeah. 

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.833
STUDENT: Bartlett and Knox? 

00:22:25.833 --> 00:22:28.367
PROFESSOR: Ah! The Bartlett and
Knox skeleton could 

00:22:28.367 --> 00:22:30.867
be made that way. 

00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:32.933
So you can make bicyclic
compounds by 

00:22:32.933 --> 00:22:34.800
a Diels-Adler reaction. 

00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.233
Or look at this one, this
molecule this unsaturated 

00:22:39.233 --> 00:22:43.367
aldehyde is called acrolein. 

00:22:43.367 --> 00:22:49.467
And you can take two molecules
of that, and dimerize them. 

00:22:49.467 --> 00:22:50.967
What's special about this one? 

00:22:50.967 --> 00:22:53.200
How's that different from the
other ones? 

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.967
What's special about the
6-membered ring? 

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.167
It has an oxygen in it. 

00:22:59.167 --> 00:23:02.800
It's not just carbons that can
do this trick. 

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.700
So what they all have in common
is they form a 6- 

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.900
membered ring with a double bond
in it. 

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.233
Although, if you use an
acetylene it could be two 

00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:12.100
double bonds. 

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.267
But when you want to do a
synthesis project and you see 

00:23:15.267 --> 00:23:18.433
that there's a 6-membered ring
with a double bond in it, 

00:23:18.433 --> 00:23:21.033
you think Diels-Alder reaction.

00:23:21.033 --> 00:23:24.567
So you see, if you can take it
apart into an ene and a diene 

00:23:24.567 --> 00:23:25.867
that would do that kind of
thing. 

00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:38.033
So, the Diels-Alder reaction has
this cyclic, six-electron 

00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:40.033
transition state, the one we
look at here. 

00:23:40.033 --> 00:23:43.867
And we could actually look at
what the transition state 

00:23:43.867 --> 00:23:47.167
looks like and the motion at the
time the two bonds are 

00:23:47.167 --> 00:23:48.900
being formed in parallel. 

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:55.200
So we have the HOMO in front and
the LUMO behind, or 

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.600
actually on top, and those will
interact to give a HOMO-- 

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:03.367
not the HOMO, but the HOMO -1 as
it turns out in 

00:24:03.367 --> 00:24:04.667
the transition state. 

00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:07.967
But it has this node right down
the middle that both of 

00:24:07.967 --> 00:24:11.567
the starting pieces had. 

00:24:11.567 --> 00:24:16.533
And if you look at the LUMO on
the bottom and the HOMO on the 

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:21.167
top, then they give the HOMO in
the transition state which 

00:24:21.167 --> 00:24:24.867
doesn't have the node down the
middle. 

00:24:24.867 --> 00:24:27.433
So that's how they go together
in the transition state. 

00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:31.967
And here we see, I think, the
motion that's involved in 

00:24:31.967 --> 00:24:33.700
going through the transition
state. 

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:36.433
It's curious that the hydrogens
stay more or less in 

00:24:36.433 --> 00:24:39.500
place and the carbons do most of
the moving 

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:40.767
in forming the bonds. 

00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:47.200
Now can we do the same thing
with two alkenes? 

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.067
Can we take two alkenes and have
them come together to 

00:24:50.067 --> 00:24:51.433
form a cyclobutane? 

00:24:51.433 --> 00:24:52.667
What do you think? 

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.600
Any thoughts on this one? 

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.767
How many electrons involved in
this ring that we're making in 

00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:05.300
the transition state when we are
bringing these together 

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:06.567
and make them overlap? 

00:25:08.667 --> 00:25:11.000
How many electrons are changing
in this process? 

00:25:15.733 --> 00:25:18.200
Ayesha? 

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.167
STUDENT: Two pi to two sigma
electrons. 

00:25:20.167 --> 00:25:23.400
PROFESSOR: There is pi here, and
pi here-- that's four 

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.800
electrons-- 

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.967
and they become these two bonds
here, two sigma bonds. 

00:25:27.967 --> 00:25:30.300
So, there are four electrons. 

00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:34.267
So it's 4n, where n is 1, not
4n+2, as in 

00:25:34.267 --> 00:25:35.767
the Diels-Alder reaction. 

00:25:35.767 --> 00:25:36.867
So this one would have an 

00:25:36.867 --> 00:25:39.867
anti-aromatic transition state.

00:25:39.867 --> 00:25:42.700
Of course, it also is strained
here, so the reaction might be 

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.400
expected to go the other way,
but that doesn't work either. 

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.800
It's the same transition state
with four pi electrons-- 

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.200
four electrons involved. 

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.000
So it doesn't work in either
direction. 

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.867
On the other hand, another way
of looking at it is the HOMO 

00:25:57.867 --> 00:26:01.133
of one is orthogonal to the LUMO
of the other. 

00:26:01.133 --> 00:26:04.167
That's the same analysis we did
in showing why H2 can't 

00:26:04.167 --> 00:26:05.433
add to an alkene. 

00:26:08.433 --> 00:26:13.267
But if we shine light on it then
we take an electron out 

00:26:13.267 --> 00:26:17.600
of the HOMO and put it into the
LUMO, and now you can get 

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:20.933
stabilization because you've
changed the symmetry of what 

00:26:20.933 --> 00:26:22.267
the orbitals are. 

00:26:22.267 --> 00:26:26.833
So now in the excited state the
HOMO can interact with the 

00:26:26.833 --> 00:26:29.967
LUMO of the other one because
you've changed it from pi to 

00:26:29.967 --> 00:26:33.067
pi-star in putting light in. 

00:26:33.067 --> 00:26:36.133
So that is when you shift an
electron from the HOMO to the 

00:26:36.133 --> 00:26:39.167
LUMO, then you can get the
reaction to occur. 

00:26:39.167 --> 00:26:43.900
And it's an important reaction
for most people. Because this 

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.700
is a DNA of a double helix. 

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:50.933
On the right is A-T-T-G and on
the left is T-A-A-C. But if we 

00:26:50.933 --> 00:26:54.967
looked right here in the middle,
we see two T's. 

00:26:54.967 --> 00:26:59.633
So if we zoom in on that we're
looking in the 

00:26:59.633 --> 00:27:01.267
plane of that thing. 

00:27:01.267 --> 00:27:03.767
Let's rotate it out toward you
so you look down 

00:27:03.767 --> 00:27:05.667
on those two T's. 

00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:07.533
We'll look at just that bit
of it...

00:27:07.533 --> 00:27:08.800
and rotate it up... and that's

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:12.233
what it looks like, and we could
see what's in front and 

00:27:12.233 --> 00:27:13.800
what's in back this way. 

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.000
And notice there is a double
bond here, and 

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.267
a double bond here. 

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:24.033
Will they react the with one
another to make a cyclobutane? 

00:27:24.033 --> 00:27:27.633
No, because it's four pi
electrons that are involved. 

00:27:27.633 --> 00:27:29.667
It's not an aromatic transition
state. 

00:27:29.667 --> 00:27:33.433
How could you make them react
with one another? 

00:27:33.433 --> 00:27:33.767
Pardon me. 

00:27:33.767 --> 00:27:34.733
STUDENT: Light. 

00:27:34.733 --> 00:27:37.367
PROFESSOR: With light. 

00:27:37.367 --> 00:27:41.967
So if you use UVB and don't put
on sunscreen, then you get 

00:27:41.967 --> 00:27:47.433
that reaction happening, and it
forms a cyclobutane. 

00:27:47.433 --> 00:27:51.467
And this thymine
photodimerization to do that 

00:27:51.467 --> 00:27:56.433
makes the chain kink... of that
chain where the two dimerized. 

00:27:56.433 --> 00:27:59.900
And that inhibits DNA
replication and transcription 

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:03.033
and is believed to be the main
source of the mutations that 

00:28:03.033 --> 00:28:04.933
gives rise to melanomas. 

00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:07.067
So that's why you put your
sunscreen on 

00:28:07.067 --> 00:28:08.267
that takes out UVB. 

00:28:08.267 --> 00:28:12.400
It's to stop that
photodimerization of thymine. 

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:18.067
Now we've been looking at
cycloadditions... which is one 

00:28:18.067 --> 00:28:21.133
class of these things where the
pericyclic reactions-- 

00:28:21.133 --> 00:28:23.933
where you can have aromatic
transition states. 

00:28:23.933 --> 00:28:26.200
And now we're going to look at
the other kind which is 

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.033
electrocyclic reactions, where
you start with a conjugated 

00:28:30.033 --> 00:28:35.233
chain and curl it around to make
a ring. 

00:28:35.233 --> 00:28:39.933
So you can start with hexatriene
and make a new bond 

00:28:39.933 --> 00:28:43.433
at the bottom, shift the pi
bonds to make a cyclic 

00:28:43.433 --> 00:28:46.433
compound, cyclohexadiene. 

00:28:46.433 --> 00:28:49.467
Now, of course, you have groups
that are substituted on 

00:28:49.467 --> 00:28:52.400
the ends here. Maybe just
hydrogens that are in the 

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:55.133
plane in the starting material,
but in and out of 

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:57.000
the plane in the product. 

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.867
So you're going to have to twist
those carbons to make 

00:28:59.867 --> 00:29:03.467
those things that are in-plane
out-of-plane. 

00:29:03.467 --> 00:29:08.300
So changing the pi to the sigma
bond requires a twist in 

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:11.600
one of two ways. 

00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:16.700
You can either twist it this
way. Where this comes up and 

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:21.567
that goes down, and that's
called conrotation, 

00:29:21.567 --> 00:29:23.667
because as we look at it here
both of them are going 

00:29:23.667 --> 00:29:27.267
counterclockwise in the same
direction. 

00:29:27.267 --> 00:29:31.200
Or we could go through this
other geometry and rotate this 

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.733
one counterclockwise, but the
one on the left clockwise, and 

00:29:35.733 --> 00:29:38.533
that's called disrotation, they
rotate in opposite 

00:29:38.533 --> 00:29:39.467
directions. 

00:29:39.467 --> 00:29:43.100
Either way would take these four
groups here and make them 

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.533
in and out of the plane as they
need to be to form a 

00:29:45.533 --> 00:29:47.033
sigma bond. 

00:29:47.033 --> 00:29:49.033
Is there a preference between
these? 

00:29:52.033 --> 00:29:56.367
Well notice... if you do it this
way, that the p orbitals that 

00:29:56.367 --> 00:29:59.800
are on top in the starting
material are bending in toward 

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.700
one another. 

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:04.367
The top of one end touches the
top of the other end... as they 

00:30:04.367 --> 00:30:07.633
rotate in opposite directions. 

00:30:07.633 --> 00:30:11.933
So that among these orbitals,
there's always going to be an 

00:30:11.933 --> 00:30:14.100
even number of nodes. 

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.633
This has no nodes, but if you
change the sign here to make 

00:30:17.633 --> 00:30:20.633
this a node here, you'd have to
have a node 

00:30:20.633 --> 00:30:22.733
someplace else as well. 

00:30:22.733 --> 00:30:24.800
So you have to have an even
number of nodes. 

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.967
We saw that in benzene too. 

00:30:27.967 --> 00:30:30.167
So that's like these things that
were involved in in the 

00:30:30.167 --> 00:30:34.333
Hueckel rule where you have a
ring and they all touch one 

00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:35.367
other on the top. 

00:30:35.367 --> 00:30:37.367
You have an even number of
nodes. 

00:30:37.367 --> 00:30:40.333
But if you twist in the opposite
direction then the 

00:30:40.333 --> 00:30:44.667
top on the right touches the
bottom on the left, and now as 

00:30:44.667 --> 00:30:47.267
you go around you have an odd
number of nodes. 

00:30:47.267 --> 00:30:49.867
There's a node here between
these two as they're beginning 

00:30:49.867 --> 00:30:52.400
to touch, but no other nodes. 

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.733
So an odd number of nodes. 

00:30:54.733 --> 00:30:57.467
So it's just the opposite of
what Hueckel is. 

00:30:57.467 --> 00:30:59.633
Now what name should we
associate with that? 

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:05.467
Have you ever seen something
that looks like that? 

00:31:05.467 --> 00:31:07.700
What's funny about it? 

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:12.967
You notice if you trace the top
of it, you get a node 

00:31:12.967 --> 00:31:16.233
where it has to change from red
to blue, if red is one 

00:31:16.233 --> 00:31:20.300
sign and blue is the other sign
of a p orbital. 

00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.300
It had to twist so at one place
there's a node as you go 

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.300
around this if you drew a bunch
of p orbitals on that. 

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.967
So you have to have an odd
number of nodes if you have 

00:31:29.967 --> 00:31:31.000
that connectivity. 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.500
And I heard you say that that's
called a Moebius strip. 

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.067
So the opposite of Hueckel is
Moebius-- 

00:31:38.067 --> 00:31:40.900
two different ways of doing this
rotation to form the 

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.700
sigma bond, Hueckel and Moebius.

00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:50.067
Now here's the transition state
that would do the Hueckel 

00:31:50.067 --> 00:31:55.300
where the top is touching the
top to form a sigma bond. 

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.967
And notice that as you do that
you 

00:31:56.967 --> 00:31:58.767
preserve a mirror of symmetry. 

00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:04.033
On the left there's not a
mirror. 

00:32:04.033 --> 00:32:06.433
Do you see what symmetry there
is on the left? 

00:32:06.433 --> 00:32:10.000
What will change the left hand
side of this molecule into the f

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.167
right hand side? 

00:32:12.167 --> 00:32:14.033
What does it look like? 

00:32:14.033 --> 00:32:19.100
Things like this, it's like a
propeller. 

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:20.333
If I could do it, here. 

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:26.700
So it has an axis of symmetry
that happens all the way from 

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:28.033
the starting material to the
product. 

00:32:28.033 --> 00:32:31.967
So this has a mirror. And this
has an axis of symmetry. 

00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:33.667
Now let's see what that does. 

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:37.600
Let's follow each orbital in the
starting material as it 

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.600
becomes an orbital in the
product, and see which 

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.767
starting material orbital
becomes which product orbital 

00:32:44.767 --> 00:32:47.867
for these two different ways:
the Hueckel connectivity where 

00:32:47.867 --> 00:32:51.767
you always have a mirror of
symmetry, and the Moebius where

00:32:51.767 --> 00:32:54.733
you always have an axis of
symmetry. 

00:32:54.733 --> 00:32:58.367
So of these six-- 

00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:01.300
you have six atomic orbitals
here, a p orbital here, here, 

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.967
here, here, here, here, six. 

00:33:02.967 --> 00:33:06.000
We have six molecular orbitals,
no nodes, one node, 

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.767
two nodes, three nodes, four
nodes, five nodes of which 

00:33:08.767 --> 00:33:11.967
three are occupied by the three
electron pairs. 

00:33:11.967 --> 00:33:15.067
The same starting material over
on the right, and in the 

00:33:15.067 --> 00:33:19.267
product, we have four p
orbitals in the conjugated 

00:33:19.267 --> 00:33:21.667
systems, so psi-1, -2, -3, -4. 

00:33:21.667 --> 00:33:25.067
No nodes, one node, two nodes,
three nodes but we have a 

00:33:25.067 --> 00:33:28.633
sigma and a sigma-star in the
product in both cases. 

00:33:28.633 --> 00:33:31.600
But we have the question of
where do the electrons that 

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.067
start here end up at the
product. 

00:33:35.067 --> 00:33:38.967
That's our question... to track
the MOs. 

00:33:38.967 --> 00:33:43.900
So let's look first at psi-1,
and we'll use as a model the 

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.500
aromatic analog, Hueckel 

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.400
connectivity, where we're 

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.667
not doing this reaction 

00:33:48.667 --> 00:33:50.367
but just looking at a benzene. 

00:33:50.367 --> 00:33:52.100
This is what we did last time. 

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:55.467
Remember if we bring these two
ends together, they'll touch 

00:33:55.467 --> 00:33:57.500
here, and that'll become more
stable. 

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.567
So this one here goes down in
the product. 

00:34:01.567 --> 00:34:02.833
We looked at that last time. 

00:34:05.367 --> 00:34:08.733
So that will happen-- 

00:34:08.733 --> 00:34:12.333
here is at the transition state,
and you see that when 

00:34:12.333 --> 00:34:13.900
you have the mirror that's
happening. 

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:17.133
The ones that are red on top are
overlapping here, and it's 

00:34:17.133 --> 00:34:19.733
going to build as it goes on
toward product. 

00:34:19.733 --> 00:34:21.733
This will get bigger and bigger
because that's an 

00:34:21.733 --> 00:34:24.067
important overlap. 

00:34:24.067 --> 00:34:27.400
The pi-bonds back here get
smaller and smaller, and this 

00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:31.667
orbital of the starting
material, this one, smoothly 

00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:35.933
converts into sigma through that
transition state. 

00:34:35.933 --> 00:34:38.500
So psi-1 becomes sigma. 

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.533
Now think about it on the left.

00:34:41.533 --> 00:34:44.800
As you begin to do it, as you
rotate them in opposite 

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.433
directions, the bottom here
touches the top here. 

00:34:48.433 --> 00:34:52.800
That's going toward a sigma*
anti-bond not 

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.233
toward a bond. 

00:34:54.233 --> 00:34:57.367
In fact how it avoids going way,
way up in energy-- 

00:34:57.367 --> 00:34:58.600
that electron pair-- 

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:04.567
is to decrease the size in front
and increase it in back. 

00:35:04.567 --> 00:35:11.100
But when it increases in back,
it forms psi-1. 

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:17.633
It makes the nodeless set of
four here. 

00:35:17.633 --> 00:35:20.500
So this one doesn't go to sigma
the way it did here, it 

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.567
goes to psi-1. 

00:35:22.567 --> 00:35:25.000
Now let's look at-- there are
three pairs of electrons were 

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.633
talking about, that's the lowest
one of 

00:35:26.633 --> 00:35:27.900
the starting material. 

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.033
Let's look at the next one. 

00:35:30.033 --> 00:35:35.867
As we brought it together to
make a ring in the aromatic 

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:39.567
case. That was unfavorable
antibonding. 

00:35:39.567 --> 00:35:44.167
So, in fact, this pair of
electronics went up in energy, 

00:35:44.167 --> 00:35:47.733
and if we look here. We see the
same thing. 

00:35:47.733 --> 00:35:49.133
This psi-2-- 

00:35:49.133 --> 00:35:50.367
where we're starting-- 

00:35:50.367 --> 00:35:52.733
is ending up in a pi orbital. 

00:35:52.733 --> 00:35:58.033
Notice it's decreasing in front
and increasing and back, 

00:35:58.033 --> 00:36:00.700
but with a node because of that
mirror. 

00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.667
So it's not psi-1 the lowest-- 

00:36:03.667 --> 00:36:06.433
the one where all the p's are in
phase-- it is the one that 

00:36:06.433 --> 00:36:07.933
has a node in the middle. 

00:36:07.933 --> 00:36:11.133
So it goes to psi-2 of the
product. 

00:36:11.133 --> 00:36:17.233
But over on this side it goes to
sigma because if it had a 

00:36:17.233 --> 00:36:20.967
node here in the beginning, now
the red on the bottom and 

00:36:20.967 --> 00:36:22.633
red on the top are touching one
another. 

00:36:22.633 --> 00:36:25.400
So that's going to make sigma. 

00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:28.367
Now let's look at the third
electron pair. 

00:36:28.367 --> 00:36:31.167
And we saw that in the aromatic
system it 

00:36:31.167 --> 00:36:33.467
went down in energy. 

00:36:33.467 --> 00:36:37.367
And in this case, here it is at
the transition state, and 

00:36:37.367 --> 00:36:40.067
it's going down in energy, and
in fact, it's 

00:36:40.067 --> 00:36:41.567
going to form psi-1. 

00:36:41.567 --> 00:36:46.567
It's not so easy to see that
here, but you can see that 

00:36:46.567 --> 00:36:49.967
it's decreasing in front at
least. I admit that 

00:36:49.967 --> 00:36:51.333
it's hard to see. 

00:36:51.333 --> 00:36:56.633
On the other side over here it's
going to decrease in 

00:36:56.633 --> 00:36:59.500
front because that's an
antibonding interaction. 

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:04.067
But the thing it's getting in
back is blue, red, and red. 

00:37:04.067 --> 00:37:06.900
It's got two nodes. 

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.733
So it's not going to psi-1,
we've already done that, it's 

00:37:09.733 --> 00:37:12.767
not going to psi-2, which has
only one node, it's going to 

00:37:12.767 --> 00:37:16.267
psi-3, which has two nodes. 

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:19.133
And that is terrible. 

00:37:19.133 --> 00:37:20.633
Those electrons are-- 

00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:23.633
these sort of cancel one
another, but these are going 

00:37:23.633 --> 00:37:24.967
way upstairs. 

00:37:24.967 --> 00:37:27.833
Whereas over here, these two
sort of canceled one another, 

00:37:27.833 --> 00:37:29.667
but this is going downstairs. 

00:37:29.667 --> 00:37:33.733
So it's much easier to do the
Hueckel then it is Moebius if 

00:37:33.733 --> 00:37:36.467
you have three electron pairs. 

00:37:36.467 --> 00:37:39.867
Notice that if you had only two
electron pairs, you'd have 

00:37:39.867 --> 00:37:45.033
this which more or less cancels
versus if you had only 

00:37:45.033 --> 00:37:48.567
two electron pairs this one goes
up more so. 

00:37:48.567 --> 00:37:51.267
So it goes the other way. 

00:37:51.267 --> 00:37:52.733
We can also look at what would
happen 

00:37:52.733 --> 00:37:55.633
with the other orbitals. 

00:37:55.633 --> 00:37:59.700
And notice that if we took an
electron from here, and put it 

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.967
into here, then it's going to go
down in energy. 

00:38:02.967 --> 00:38:07.300
So photochemically, we could
make it prefer the left path 

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:08.567
with six electrons. 

00:38:10.867 --> 00:38:13.767
So, again, that's what actually
happens thermally in 

00:38:13.767 --> 00:38:17.000
a normal reaction, it's the
Hueckel with six 

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.233
electrons not Moebius. 

00:38:22.367 --> 00:38:26.367
So disrotation is preferred for
a six electron shift, so 

00:38:26.367 --> 00:38:29.833
that if you have methyls like
that, the two methyls will end 

00:38:29.833 --> 00:38:31.600
up on the same side. 

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:36.267
Say if this one rotates up, this
one also rotates up. 

00:38:36.267 --> 00:38:39.533
That is if it's my little
fingers, they go like that, 

00:38:39.533 --> 00:38:43.633
they rotate in opposite
directions, not in the same 

00:38:43.633 --> 00:38:47.133
direction or one would go up and
the other down. 

00:38:47.133 --> 00:38:51.133
So stereochemistry shows you the
form-- and notice that the cis

00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:53.067
is the less stable isomer. 

00:38:53.067 --> 00:38:56.567
It's not forming that because
it's more stable. It's forming 

00:38:56.567 --> 00:38:59.200
it despite the fact that it's
less stable, because it 

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.433
prefers to do that. 

00:39:00.433 --> 00:39:02.367
That's 4n+2. 

00:39:02.367 --> 00:39:07.267
So how can you study whether the
opposite conrotation would 

00:39:07.267 --> 00:39:14.533
occur like this if it were 4n
electrons? 

00:39:14.533 --> 00:39:17.633
What system would you look at? 

00:39:17.633 --> 00:39:20.933
How would you get four electrons
rather than six? 

00:39:20.933 --> 00:39:24.233
What starting material would you
use? 

00:39:24.233 --> 00:39:27.067
Any ideas? 

00:39:27.067 --> 00:39:31.767
Here you start with hexatriene
so what do you go to use? 

00:39:31.767 --> 00:39:31.967
Nathan? 

00:39:31.967 --> 00:39:33.233
STUDENT: A diene? 

00:39:33.233 --> 00:39:36.233
PROFESSOR: The diene, butadiene.

00:39:36.233 --> 00:39:38.967
So we'll do this, we will start
with butadiene that has 

00:39:38.967 --> 00:39:42.067
methyls substituted, so we know
stereochemistry. 

00:39:42.067 --> 00:39:44.367
And we expect it then to do-- 

00:39:44.367 --> 00:39:45.433
if it does-- 

00:39:45.433 --> 00:39:49.533
let's see so we got methyl on
the right here, and on the 

00:39:49.533 --> 00:39:56.800
left here, and if they do
conrotation, they'll come out 

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.233
on the same side. 

00:40:00.233 --> 00:40:03.767
So that's what we'll do, but
there's a problem. 

00:40:03.767 --> 00:40:07.900
And the problem is this, this
reaction is exothermic by 16 

00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:10.533
kilocalories because you're
converting a pi bond into a 

00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:11.767
sigma bond. 

00:40:11.767 --> 00:40:14.933
But up above it's not so great
because you're forming a 

00:40:14.933 --> 00:40:17.333
cyclobutane which is strained. 

00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:20.333
And that is uphill 11
kilocalories per mole. 

00:40:20.333 --> 00:40:21.600
The reaction won't work. 

00:40:24.367 --> 00:40:26.233
That's not so great. 

00:40:26.233 --> 00:40:28.300
So we can't do that reaction,
right? 

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:30.300
We can't study it with that
system. 

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.267
Right? 

00:40:31.267 --> 00:40:33.300
Wrong. 

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:34.700
We can run it the other
direction. 

00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:41.500
Start with the
dimethocyclobutane and see 

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:45.567
which butadiene it forms.
Because it's the same 

00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:47.867
transition state when you run
one way and the other. 

00:40:47.867 --> 00:40:50.400
If you have a certain transition
state that's low, 

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.833
you can access it not only
coming this direction, but 

00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:55.667
also that same low one coming
back. 

00:40:55.667 --> 00:40:59.100
So we can do the same test
starting with the cyclic form 

00:40:59.100 --> 00:41:00.867
and coming back. 

00:41:00.867 --> 00:41:05.167
And that was done by Brauman and
Archie in 1972, and it's 

00:41:05.167 --> 00:41:07.667
interesting to see how they made
the compound. 

00:41:07.667 --> 00:41:11.833
This what they needed that
cis-dimethylcyclobutane. 

00:41:11.833 --> 00:41:13.700
How did they make it? 

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.233
They made it starting with a
cycloaddition where acetylene 

00:41:17.233 --> 00:41:21.800
adds to a double bond to give a
cyclobutene. 

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.233
And it had these carbons
attached to it which then they 

00:41:24.233 --> 00:41:25.067
reduced off. 

00:41:25.067 --> 00:41:26.933
We will talk about that reaction
later. 

00:41:26.933 --> 00:41:30.467
And they made the OH as a good
leaving group with a tosylate. 

00:41:30.467 --> 00:41:33.567
And then they used H- to do the
displacement to convert 

00:41:33.567 --> 00:41:35.033
that into methyl. 

00:41:35.033 --> 00:41:37.800
But the crucial reaction was
this cycloaddition. 

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.567
How does that look to you to add
a triple bond to a double 

00:41:41.567 --> 00:41:43.167
bond to make a four-membered
ring? 

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:45.067
Good or bad? 

00:41:45.067 --> 00:41:45.400
Bad. 

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:50.267
It's 4n electrons, two pi bonds
coming together. 

00:41:50.267 --> 00:41:51.467
But what do you notice? 

00:41:51.467 --> 00:41:54.267
how do they make it work? 

00:41:54.267 --> 00:41:55.567
They wanted to do that. 

00:41:55.567 --> 00:41:56.433
What was special? 

00:41:56.433 --> 00:41:58.433
STUDENT: They used light. 

00:41:58.433 --> 00:42:01.700
PROFESSOR: It's a four-electron
cycloaddition that 

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:06.233
should be bad, but they used
light to do it. 

00:42:06.233 --> 00:42:08.967
So they put the electron into
the orbital of opposite 

00:42:08.967 --> 00:42:11.733
symmetry. And now it will work.

00:42:11.733 --> 00:42:17.967
So we already saw that forms the
less stable isomer, so 

00:42:17.967 --> 00:42:20.467
it's disrotation with six
electrons. 

00:42:20.467 --> 00:42:24.567
But this is the experiment they
did, at 280 degrees-- 

00:42:24.567 --> 00:42:26.333
it's not an easy reaction-- 

00:42:26.333 --> 00:42:31.067
the ring opened up and they got
this isomer as expected. 

00:42:31.067 --> 00:42:37.000
So this rotated in to the right,
and this rotated out to 

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.400
the right, it's conrotation. 

00:42:40.967 --> 00:42:42.167
Like that. 

00:42:42.167 --> 00:42:46.833
So it's disrotation with six
electrons, conrotation with 

00:42:46.833 --> 00:42:50.367
four, and what was special about
them was not only did 

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:54.300
they measure that that was
99.9%, they measured how much 

00:42:54.300 --> 00:42:55.933
of the other one there was. 

00:42:55.933 --> 00:42:59.300
There was about 0.005%. 

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.633
This was really, really careful
work they did, and 

00:43:01.633 --> 00:43:03.633
it's an interesting paper to
read. 

00:43:03.633 --> 00:43:05.267
So that says-- 

00:43:05.267 --> 00:43:09.300
notice that this is the less
stable isomer. Because it has a

00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:12.400
cis bond where these are
both trans.

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.233
So there's the bias that
favors-- 

00:43:15.233 --> 00:43:21.167
that 99.9 to 0.005 is 11
kilocalories per mole-- 

00:43:21.167 --> 00:43:24.467
but the bias in favor of this
kind of rotation must be even 

00:43:24.467 --> 00:43:29.267
higher, because it's being hurt
by the fact that this one 

00:43:29.267 --> 00:43:31.000
is strained. 

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.800
So it's something greater than
11 kilocalories per mole 

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.533
favoring the transition state
for conrotation in that. Which 

00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:43.167
supports what we predicted by
theory. 

00:43:43.167 --> 00:43:44.833
And if you have an
eight-membered

00:43:44.833 --> 00:43:46.167
ring with four double

00:43:46.167 --> 00:43:50.267
bonds in it, that reaction
happens at -10 degrees and 

00:43:50.267 --> 00:43:55.033
again it rotates like that, it's
a conrotation. 

00:43:55.033 --> 00:43:59.200
So it's conrotation for 4n
electrons here, or here, 

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.867
n is 0, n is 1. 

00:44:01.867 --> 00:44:05.067
But it's disrotation for 4n+2. 

00:44:05.067 --> 00:44:08.367
So it's what we expected for
these electrocyclic reactions. 

00:44:08.367 --> 00:44:12.333
And we can look at the
transition states for the two 

00:44:12.333 --> 00:44:17.767
and see that that's what would
happen if you could run it 

00:44:17.767 --> 00:44:22.900
forwards, and there's the
transition state. 

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.567
This is the same kind of thing
we did before. 

00:44:24.567 --> 00:44:27.967
I'm not going to dwell on this
now. 

00:44:27.967 --> 00:44:32.033
Now a particular example of that
kind of thing is opening 

00:44:32.033 --> 00:44:33.033
Dewar benzene. 

00:44:33.033 --> 00:44:35.600
Remember last semester we talked
about Dewar who sent 

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.100
Kekule these models of all the
different possible structures 

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.167
for benzene, and one of them was
this which came to be 

00:44:42.167 --> 00:44:45.267
called Dewar benzene, even
though he didn't advocate that 

00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:46.500
as a structure benzene. 

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:49.133
He thought it was this, the same
way other people did, but 

00:44:49.133 --> 00:44:52.600
he said it's a conceivable
structure of benzene. 

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.067
But notice that this one would
be strained, and that one 

00:44:55.067 --> 00:44:56.100
would be stable. 

00:44:56.100 --> 00:44:58.900
So if you could go from this to
this, if you could get 

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.900
this, it would be way down hill
in energy. Because this is 

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:05.233
unusually stable being aromatic.

00:45:05.233 --> 00:45:08.767
This is unusually unstable.
Because it has two four 

00:45:08.767 --> 00:45:10.800
membered rings. 

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.233
So it would really help to do
that. 

00:45:13.233 --> 00:45:15.700
So it should be a really easy
reaction. 

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.367
It really wants to open up. 

00:45:17.367 --> 00:45:18.800
Now does it? 

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.833
Well in 2004, there was a paper
where they calculated 

00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:25.867
the energy for isomers of
benzene, and they had all 

00:45:25.867 --> 00:45:28.367
these isomers of benzene,
there's benzene, and there 

00:45:28.367 --> 00:45:31.367
were 218 isomers. 

00:45:31.367 --> 00:45:36.067
And, in fact, 84 of them are
calculated to be within 100 

00:45:36.067 --> 00:45:39.767
kilocalories, benzene is the
lowest one, but there are many 

00:45:39.767 --> 00:45:43.233
within the strength of a bond
above it. 

00:45:43.233 --> 00:45:50.500
And, in fact, six of them have
been prepared, but they don't 

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:55.500
go to benzene because breaking a
single bond-- 

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.133
these are more than 100
kilocalories above. 

00:45:58.133 --> 00:46:00.867
So if you could go to benzene by
breaking a bond it would be 

00:46:00.867 --> 00:46:04.100
very favorable, but you can't
because if you look at these 

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.133
structures breaking a single
bond won't take you to 

00:46:07.133 --> 00:46:11.433
benzene, you have to break more
bonds than that. 

00:46:11.433 --> 00:46:19.067
However, Dewar benzene, which is
this one here, is 74 

00:46:19.067 --> 00:46:22.867
kilocalories above benzene, and
you only have to break one 

00:46:22.867 --> 00:46:27.100
bond to make a change into
benzene. 

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.467
But it lasts for two days at
room temperature. 

00:46:30.467 --> 00:46:33.400
Why doesn't it go way downhill?

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:34.600
How was it prepared? 

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:38.433
It was prepared by van Tamelen
and Pappas in 1963. 

00:46:38.433 --> 00:46:42.100
And they did it, you notice by
an electrocyclic reaction 

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:47.167
where they take a diene and make
it into a cyclobutene. 

00:46:47.167 --> 00:46:52.333
And it had disrotation so they
used light to do it again, 

00:46:52.333 --> 00:46:55.367
another example. 

00:46:55.367 --> 00:46:58.867
But it has a half-life of two
days at room temperature 

00:46:58.867 --> 00:47:03.300
whereas this one, which is only
11 kilocalories 

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:09.133
exothermic. Remember that was
the one that had to be heated 

00:47:09.133 --> 00:47:12.667
to 280 degrees in order to go, 

00:47:12.667 --> 00:47:16.200
so that one has a barrier of 33
kilocalories per mole. But 

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.067
this one only 25, 

00:47:18.067 --> 00:47:22.033
not what you would expect on the
simple analysis. 

00:47:22.033 --> 00:47:25.600
So it's 66 kilocalories more
exothermic, but only 8 

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.600
kilocalories per mole faster. 

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.200
It is faster, but not very much
faster. 

00:47:33.167 --> 00:47:35.633
So this one, notice, opens
conrotatory. 

00:47:35.633 --> 00:47:39.500
We talked about that, that's
what Brauman showed, and 

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:47.167
that's what you expect for 4n
electrons where n is 2 to make 

00:47:47.167 --> 00:47:48.800
the two double bonds. 

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:56.367
But in this case-- and the HOMOs
and LUMOs there, but in 

00:47:56.367 --> 00:47:59.400
this case if you want to open it
up to make benzene. This has 

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.300
to go that way, and that has to
go that 

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.800
way to become planer. 

00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.467
If one of them went the other
direction, you'd have really 

00:48:05.467 --> 00:48:07.033
weird bond angles. 

00:48:07.033 --> 00:48:10.167
Benzene would look like this
instead of being a hexagone, 

00:48:10.167 --> 00:48:14.467
it would look like this if you
rotated the wrong way. 

00:48:14.467 --> 00:48:18.067
So you have to rotate it in the
wrong way to do that. 

00:48:18.067 --> 00:48:20.933
But wait a second, how many
electrons here? 

00:48:20.933 --> 00:48:23.133
There's going to be one on that
p orbital, one there, one 

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:26.100
here, one here, one here, that's
six. 

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:30.333
Six pi electrons is supposed to
be disrotation. 

00:48:30.333 --> 00:48:32.667
Shouldn't that work? 

00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:32.867
No. 

00:48:32.867 --> 00:48:35.267
It looks like there's something
more fundamental. 

00:48:35.267 --> 00:48:40.200
It's more fundamental that when
you're breaking this bond 

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.800
here and making sigma*, it
doesn't overlap with the HOMOs 

00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:47.433
here and here to stabilize. 

00:48:47.433 --> 00:48:50.333
So even though it's the right
number of electrons the HOMOs 

00:48:50.333 --> 00:48:53.233
and LUMOs aren't lining up
right. 

00:48:53.233 --> 00:48:57.633
So it's not numerology we're
fundamentally interested in, 

00:48:57.633 --> 00:49:00.800
it's whether HOMOs and LUMOs
matched to get stability. 

00:49:04.967 --> 00:49:08.300
The next topic is going to be
spectroscopy, and we'll get to 

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:11.767
that next Wednesday after the
exam on Monday.

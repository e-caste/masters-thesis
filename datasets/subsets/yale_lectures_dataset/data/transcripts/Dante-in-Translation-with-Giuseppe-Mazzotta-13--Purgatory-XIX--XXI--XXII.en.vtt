00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.640
Prof: We talked the last
time--

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.579
I talked a little about this
whole issue of the imagination

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:16.961
that Dante places,
along with a definition of

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:21.311
love, and the--
and love is the power that

00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:24.826
governs,
that shapes the moral world of

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:26.390
Purgatory.
 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.734
Last time we talked about these
two fossae of Canto XVII,

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:35.436
the two fossae of the center;
it really makes the center kind

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:39.510
of ellipses, as it were,
between imagination and love.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.200
Love is attached to the--it's
joined to a theory of free will,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.885
because it's by choice--because
of our choices that we can be

00:00:51.885 --> 00:00:55.789
held accountable for the actions
that we engage in:

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.252
loving wrong objects,
loving too much or loving too

00:01:01.252 --> 00:01:02.200
little.
 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.516
Some of the problems,
I think, stem from a certain

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:10.129
misunderstanding about the
imagination.

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:13.408
That Dante should place the
imagination at the center of the

00:01:13.408 --> 00:01:15.519
poem should really not surprise
you.

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:20.870
He's a poet and he thinks that
imagination is indeed the path

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.580
that he has to take in order to
come to any form of knowledge.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.500
It's only through the
imagination it's not--

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.980
that does not exclude
rationality, but that's the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.413
discourse of philosophers,
the discourse of theologians if

00:01:34.413 --> 00:01:37.200
you wish,
but he places the imagination

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.069
as his way.
 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.623
And then from that point of
view, he can even challenge some

00:01:43.623 --> 00:01:48.896
ideas of the superiority,
let's say, of rational argument

00:01:48.896 --> 00:01:51.250
over the imagination.
 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.220
The imagination is the weapon
of the poet.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.331
How--with what kind of
attributes does he invest the

00:01:58.331 --> 00:01:59.459
imagination?
 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.108
It's tied to memory.
 

00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:05.629
The Canto XVII begins with an
apostrophe to the reader's

00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:06.370
memory.
 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.488
It appears as,
in the feminine,

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:17.215
imaginativa,
the--in the--Dante's silencing

00:02:17.215 --> 00:02:20.508
the term vis.
 

00:02:20.508 --> 00:02:23.235
It has a sort of force,
imagination,

00:02:23.235 --> 00:02:25.650
it's moved by something else.
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.781
Dante does not decide whether
it's the heaven or the stars or

00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:33.292
comes from inside us,
but he has a particular power,

00:02:33.292 --> 00:02:34.669
a strange power.
 

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:38.220
It comes like a thief in the
night,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:47.769
it robs us of any degree of
consciousness about the world

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.960
outside of us and,
just as memory dislodges--the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.910
description of memory at the
beginning of Canto XVII,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.652
it's a memory that has an
incredible memory as a form of

00:03:01.652 --> 00:03:03.199
the imagination,
as you know.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:05.990
Memory and the imagination are
connected.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.848
It's a form of the imagination,
but it's a memory that has the

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:15.396
power to move up and down,
the text evokes the Alpine

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:18.408
heights and the depth of the
mole.

00:03:18.408 --> 00:03:22.425
It talks about a form of
blindness and yet it creates

00:03:22.425 --> 00:03:23.120
vision.
 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.921
Memory is a figure of time and
then the whole passage is

00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:33.431
described in terms of space,
as if imagination had the power

00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:37.860
to dislocate us from where we
think that we are.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.299
This is the point,
and it's not an unusual point

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.890
for Dante to make,
since this is the poetry of

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.173
exile, the poetry of a man who
thinks that he's a stranger

00:03:49.173 --> 00:03:51.490
while living on earth.
 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.869
A man, without a sense,
a clear sense of where his home

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:58.930
may be,
he is--this is the poetry

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.068
rooted in the consciousness of
homelessness,

00:04:03.068 --> 00:04:05.180
so the imagination is an
extension,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.718
an internalized version of this
sense of homelessness.

00:04:09.718 --> 00:04:13.810
It has a power and that power
that doesn't seem to be able to

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.139
be--
a power that cannot quite be

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:23.399
contained or coerced within
definite parameters of conduct.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:26.620
In fact, this insistence on the
imagination,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.423
I'm really recapitulating the
things that maybe I thought I

00:04:29.423 --> 00:04:31.550
said and probably I didn't say
last time,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.220
between, on the one hand,
the sin of wrath,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.470
which is a form of madness.
 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.654
That is to say,
a sin that eclipses the powers

00:04:40.654 --> 00:04:43.908
of reason, that's anger,
and on the other hand,

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:45.819
this discourse on love.
 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:49.149
This is really what I was
saying.

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:52.678
Dante understands that there is
an imagination which cannot

00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:56.660
quite be held in check,
and yet the whole point of the

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.435
poem I'm talking--
whenever I'm talking about the

00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:01.747
poem,
I point out some seemingly

00:05:01.747 --> 00:05:05.764
insignificant details like,
oh look this is a symmetry here

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.870
between Canto VI of
Inferno,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.500
Canto VI of Purgatorio,
or whatever,

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.952
to indicate that it is a poem
built with a precise principle

00:05:15.952 --> 00:05:17.709
of order in mind.
 

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:21.533
Not only it has order in its
technical execution,

00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:24.639
it has order also as a moral
problem.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.220
It's all about ordering the
appetites, ordering the will.

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.310
But at the same time along side
with it,

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.690
and this is the complexity and
the beauty of Dante's text,

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.750
this is another argument that
almost questions,

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.529
makes us--forces us into
thinking that there are some

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:48.139
elements that seem to be left
out of this fabric of order that

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.898
Dante has woven,
or if you like,

00:05:50.898 --> 00:05:53.887
the metaphor has built--
the architecture that he has

00:05:53.887 --> 00:05:54.290
built.
 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.560
Let' see how this argument
really continues.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.079
That's not the end of the story.
 

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:03.201
This is just a stage in his
movement of self-knowledge and

00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:05.009
knowledge of the world.
 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:09.230
In fact, Canto XVIII,
we're now moving into a

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.406
different moral realm,
it's a moral realm where we

00:06:13.406 --> 00:06:16.629
actually know we are moving
toward a so-called,

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:22.252
what Dante and medieval
theorists of vices call

00:06:22.252 --> 00:06:24.209
acedia.
 

00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:28.800
Acedia is a Latin term,
which in English we can

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.439
describe--
we'll describe as a sort of

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:35.480
despondency,
as a sort of indecisiveness,

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.889
sluggishness,
sloth.

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.375
That's it, that's the--if you
are interested in knowing more

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:46.100
about what the Middle Ages
thought about this,

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.800
this scholar Wenzel wrote a
book called,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.901
Acedia,
exactly about the--both in

00:06:52.901 --> 00:06:57.459
English medieval literature,
Dante and other issues.

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.528
What more precisely--how can we
go on understanding this

00:07:00.528 --> 00:07:02.088
question of acedia?
 

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:06.750
It's in a sense the parody or
the inversion of contemplation.

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.230
It's tied to a sense of loss of
the outside world.

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:17.083
Acedia describes the
condition of the mind that has

00:07:17.083 --> 00:07:22.319
found itself indifferent to the
object of desire.

00:07:22.319 --> 00:07:24.430
It really is a crisis of desire.
 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:28.091
One finds objects that--the
sloth, the sluggishness,

00:07:28.091 --> 00:07:30.459
the indecisiveness of the mind.
 

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:35.367
It is as if the objects of
desire were--had lost their

00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:38.425
consistency, their
attractiveness,

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.000
their luster.
 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.680
You just don't care.
 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.821
It's the problem,
the so-called noonday devil,

00:07:45.821 --> 00:07:51.067
the temptation of the monks,
that's why I call it a parody

00:07:51.067 --> 00:07:53.000
of contemplation.
 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.985
It's the temptation that the
monks experienced in their

00:07:56.985 --> 00:08:01.562
cloisters when they sort of find
that the whole idea of turning

00:08:01.562 --> 00:08:04.810
their minds to the divine is no
longer,

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:09.819
or provisionally perhaps,
is not appealing.

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:14.300
It's the loss of appeal of
anything outside of oneself and

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:18.625
indicates a kind of both
intellectual and dreamy sort of

00:08:18.625 --> 00:08:23.500
condition and that's really what
I want to talk about now.

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:29.302
Canto XVIII is the most
intellectual of cantos in

00:08:29.302 --> 00:08:31.600
Purgatory.
 

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.700
Dante faces a theoretical issue.
 

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.416
He's talking to Virgil,
and these theoretical issues of

00:08:39.416 --> 00:08:44.219
Canto XVIII flow out of the
problems that we have had in

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:46.490
discussing Canto XVII.
 

00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:48.577
As you know,
we are talking about

00:08:48.577 --> 00:08:51.707
imagination and love,
and there is an imagination

00:08:51.707 --> 00:08:53.600
that somehow is vagabond.
 

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.524
It's a thief,
breaks out of any particular

00:08:56.524 --> 00:08:58.529
confines;
it dislodges us.

00:08:58.529 --> 00:09:03.346
It takes the ground out of our
own certainties about the way we

00:09:03.346 --> 00:09:04.590
see the world.
 

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.621
Remember that the image with
which Canto XVII starts,

00:09:08.621 --> 00:09:12.809
Dante places us in a world
which is at the twilight.

00:09:12.809 --> 00:09:14.350
There's no real light.
 

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.178
It's all foggy,
and then all of a sudden,

00:09:17.178 --> 00:09:19.664
we do see something,
and it's unclear whether we see

00:09:19.664 --> 00:09:22.538
something because of the light
that comes from within us.

00:09:22.538 --> 00:09:25.903
Memories, for instance,
that's a light we carry within

00:09:25.903 --> 00:09:27.679
us, confused,
as they may be,

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:30.600
or some other kind of conscious
intuition.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:34.260
That's really the discourse of
the imagination and that

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.158
dislodged some of us here.
 

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:41.110
That made it a little difficult
to try to get a hold of--grasp.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.428
Dante has the same problem in
Canto XVIII.

00:09:44.428 --> 00:09:48.899
Canto XVIII begins with a
question that he asks of Virgil.

00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:53.253
You are talking about love,
you are talking about this

00:09:53.253 --> 00:09:57.690
inclination, the whole theory of
love in Canto XVII.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:01.693
He says, "Master,
my sight,"

00:10:01.693 --> 00:10:06.240
this is Canto XVIII the very
beginning,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.306
"is so quickened in thy
light that I discern clearly all

00:10:10.306 --> 00:10:12.950
that thy words set forth and
explain;

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.307
and I pray therefore,
dear and gentle Father,

00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:20.884
that thou expound love to me,
to which thou reduce every good

00:10:20.884 --> 00:10:23.480
action and its opposite."
 

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.190
Whatever you have told me in
Canto XVII really is not enough.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:33.115
And Virgil goes on explaining
the theory--that it's a very

00:10:33.115 --> 00:10:37.350
philosophical theory,
that we have perceptions.

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:41.517
Your perception takes from
outward reality an impression

00:10:41.517 --> 00:10:45.609
and unfolds it within you,
so it makes the mind turn to

00:10:45.609 --> 00:10:46.139
it.
 

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:50.511
Whatever the will is bound,
that's really what we call

00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:51.419
pleasure.
 

00:10:51.419 --> 00:10:53.168
I'm paraphrasing poorly.
 

00:10:53.168 --> 00:10:57.330
"Thy words and my
following..."

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:00.532
Excuse me, let me just mention
another little passage:

00:11:00.532 --> 00:11:03.009
"Now may be plain,"
line 35,

00:11:03.009 --> 00:11:05.922
"Now may be plain to thee
how hidden is the truth for

00:11:05.922 --> 00:11:08.272
those who maintain that every
love is in itself

00:11:08.272 --> 00:11:09.548
praiseworthy..."
 

00:11:09.548 --> 00:11:13.259
He's attacking--this is the
view of the Epicureans who

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:17.221
believe that every pleasure,
without any particular judgment

00:11:17.221 --> 00:11:19.360
attached to the object of
pleasure,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.298
is praiseworthy.
 

00:11:20.298 --> 00:11:24.154
Dante says no,
we have to exercise some moral

00:11:24.154 --> 00:11:25.120
judgment.
 

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.269
We have to create distinctions.
 

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:32.918
We have to discriminate between
the good and the bad love.

00:11:32.918 --> 00:11:33.422
"...
 

00:11:33.422 --> 00:11:35.880
perhaps because its matter
always seems good,

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:39.288
but not every stamp is good,
even if it be good wax."

00:11:39.288 --> 00:11:43.029
I would even go so far as to
say that he's really thinking

00:11:43.029 --> 00:11:47.966
now of his friend Cavalcanti--
Guido's Epicurean--you saw him

00:11:47.966 --> 00:11:52.908
mention in Canto XII by name--
Epicurean leanings.

00:11:52.908 --> 00:11:57.895
The idea--that's the Epicurean
ethics, that if pleasure is

00:11:57.895 --> 00:12:03.231
really the only object really
worthy of any pursuit and that's

00:12:03.231 --> 00:12:05.769
really what we are doing.
 

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:10.730
When we are in pursuit of
knowledge or real experiences,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.970
then they claim that all of
pleasure is good.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:19.327
That's the hedonistic ethics
that Dante really renounces or

00:12:19.327 --> 00:12:20.080
debates.
 

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.825
Then, in fact,
Virgil goes on saying:

00:12:21.825 --> 00:12:23.860
"Thy words and my
following wit,"

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:26.493
this is Dante talking,
"have revealed the nature

00:12:26.493 --> 00:12:29.019
of love to me,
but that has made me more full

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:31.683
of perplexity;
for if love is offered to us

00:12:31.683 --> 00:12:35.004
from without and if the soul
moves with no other feet,

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:38.639
it has no merit when it goes
straight to crooked."

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:43.491
Now you say that everything is
love and the love that I have

00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:46.700
depends on the experience of
images,

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.283
well in what--how am I going to
deserve for choosing well or not

00:12:51.283 --> 00:12:54.448
choosing well,
since at the basis of the

00:12:54.448 --> 00:12:56.450
imagination,
we have perceptions.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:13:01.510
What I perceive may be looking
good to me and does not look

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:04.826
good to you,
so the issue is displaced from

00:13:04.826 --> 00:13:08.302
the point of the world of
imagination to the world of

00:13:08.302 --> 00:13:09.240
perception.
 

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:18.159
Virgil will go on explaining a
scholastic theory to the point

00:13:18.159 --> 00:13:23.808
that indeed we incline to the
good,

00:13:23.808 --> 00:13:27.778
but then actually we have
within us the faculty of choice.

00:13:27.778 --> 00:13:31.181
He says, "In order that to
this will every other may be

00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:34.755
conformed there is innate in you
the faculty which counsels and

00:13:34.755 --> 00:13:37.870
which ought to hold the
threshold of assent."

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.897
He's talking about,
once again, free will and he

00:13:40.897 --> 00:13:43.832
will add,
this is what I--this is on line

00:13:43.832 --> 00:13:47.195
60 and following,
this is all I can tell you from

00:13:47.195 --> 00:13:49.230
a philosophical point of view.
 

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:54.322
Other issues about the free
will will be explained to you by

00:13:54.322 --> 00:13:57.690
Beatrice when she first comes to
you.

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.268
And so it would seem to make a
distinction between the

00:14:01.268 --> 00:14:04.778
knowledge of Virgil and the
knowledge of Beatrice.

00:14:04.778 --> 00:14:08.552
He said, "As far as reason
sees here I can tell thee,

00:14:08.552 --> 00:14:10.712
beyond that;
wait only for Beatrice,

00:14:10.712 --> 00:14:13.178
for it is a matter of
faith," and so on.

00:14:13.178 --> 00:14:17.070
There seems to be two ways of
understanding this issue.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.649
The fact is that Beatrice will
never discuss this problem,

00:14:20.649 --> 00:14:23.833
but in a sense,
Beatrice represents the

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:27.269
explanation that Dante is
looking for,

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:29.778
because Beatrice is a kind of
love,

00:14:29.778 --> 00:14:34.538
for Dante, that stands for a
visionary form of love,

00:14:34.538 --> 00:14:39.053
and not just a love that can be
reduced to a question of

00:14:39.053 --> 00:14:42.090
mechanics of physics of
perception.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:48.928
That's really what Canto XVIII
seems to be doing then.

00:14:48.928 --> 00:14:53.193
It responds,
enlarges, and at the same time

00:14:53.193 --> 00:14:59.183
brings us back into the very
predicament that Canto XVII had

00:14:59.183 --> 00:15:00.908
posed for us.
 

00:15:00.908 --> 00:15:04.870
It seems that Dante is moving,
and at the same time,

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:08.519
an impasse--another impasse has
been reached.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:13.860
Now, with this in mind,
we turn to what he unavoidably

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.523
has to do,
try to translate all of these

00:15:18.523 --> 00:15:21.875
issues of love,
imagination,

00:15:21.875 --> 00:15:26.499
choice, and from the
theoretical into the

00:15:26.499 --> 00:15:31.700
autobiographical or existential
dimension.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.719
This is done in the dream,
an erotic dream that Dante

00:15:36.719 --> 00:15:40.580
relates at the beginning of
Canto XIX.

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:44.039
Before I turn to that canto,
I just want to tell you about

00:15:44.039 --> 00:15:45.740
how Dante understand this.
 

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:51.360
He has one line at the very end
of Canto XVIII that I would--

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:55.793
the last line of Canto XVIII
--that I really want to

00:15:55.793 --> 00:15:59.347
underline for you,
the whole paragraph reads:

00:15:59.347 --> 00:16:03.467
"Then when the shades were
so far parted from us that they

00:16:03.467 --> 00:16:07.883
could no longer be seen,
a new thought arose within me,

00:16:07.883 --> 00:16:11.798
from which others many and
diverse were born;

00:16:11.798 --> 00:16:17.053
and I rambled so from one to
the other, that in my wandering

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:22.220
my eyes closed and I changed my
musing into dream."

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.548
That introduces the dream of
Canto XIX,

00:16:26.548 --> 00:16:30.376
but the line in Italian is
really very interesting because

00:16:30.376 --> 00:16:34.340
it presents the connection
between thinking and dreaming.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:35.937
He says, in fact the
translation: "My

00:16:35.937 --> 00:16:37.730
musing,"
it's correct but it's really--

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:39.529
I would have said to make it
very clear,

00:16:39.529 --> 00:16:40.639
my thought.
 

00:16:40.639 --> 00:16:46.169
Dante says on line 145,
che li occhi per vaghezza

00:16:46.169 --> 00:16:51.808
ricopersi, e 'l pensamento in
sogno trasmutai.

00:16:51.808 --> 00:16:56.183
There's a kind of link,
a sort of sense of the

00:16:56.183 --> 00:17:01.724
connection between thinking and
dreaming that Dante favors

00:17:01.724 --> 00:17:05.710
dreaming at this point over
thinking.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.298
You shouldn't be surprised that
Dante's doing this.

00:17:08.298 --> 00:17:11.608
The Romance of the Rose,
a grand medieval epic,

00:17:11.608 --> 00:17:14.420
is a dream, and tells the story
of a dream.

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.157
The Book of the
Duchess--Chaucer's The

00:17:17.157 --> 00:17:20.130
Book of the Duchess,
is the story of a dream.

00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.528
The Vita nuova is full
of dreams.

00:17:22.528 --> 00:17:25.462
Even for those of you who are
interested in contemporary

00:17:25.462 --> 00:17:27.791
literature,
fairly contemporary,

00:17:27.791 --> 00:17:30.640
I'm thinking of Keats' great
poem,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.578
"Sleep and Poetry."
 

00:17:32.578 --> 00:17:34.818
I don't know how many of you
have had a chance to read that.

00:17:34.818 --> 00:17:39.896
Poets love sleeping because
sleep introduces the idea of the

00:17:39.896 --> 00:17:43.338
dream and the possibility of a
dream,

00:17:43.338 --> 00:17:46.240
the possibility of a knowledge
which is not willed.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.391
I finally have some revelations
within me which is not what I

00:17:50.391 --> 00:17:53.088
would normally have if I were
awake,

00:17:53.088 --> 00:17:57.150
so this is the great privilege
that they give to dreams.

00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:02.808
Are the Middle Ages really
conscious of this dimension?

00:18:02.808 --> 00:18:06.890
Yes, there is a text by an
author called Macrobius,

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:09.140
and if you want to know more
really,

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:14.913
which Macrobius,
who writes on The Dream of

00:18:14.913 --> 00:18:18.382
Scipio,
Cicero's figure in the

00:18:18.382 --> 00:18:21.500
Republic,
it's all about--it's an

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.308
encyclopedia of dreams and based
on Artemidorus,

00:18:25.308 --> 00:18:29.240
but it's distinctions between
oracles,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:37.308
fantasies, insomniac,
deliriums, dreams and so on.

00:18:37.308 --> 00:18:42.330
They are very conscious of the
sort of power and revelations

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:44.970
that can come through dreams.
 

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.759
What is this dream about?
 

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:50.098
It's now definitely in the
world of acedia.

00:18:50.098 --> 00:18:55.307
It's a dream--let me just read
this initial--the beginning of

00:18:55.307 --> 00:18:56.348
Canto XIX.
 

00:18:56.348 --> 00:19:00.150
I emphasize that this is now an
autobiographical--

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:04.172
the highlighting of the
autobiographical dimension of

00:19:04.172 --> 00:19:08.349
all the problems we have been
discussing from XVII,

00:19:08.349 --> 00:19:11.920
above all XVI, XVII, and XVIII.
 

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:16.960
Dante has to translate the
theories into a personal--

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.473
giving them a personal shape
and that to investigate the kind

00:19:21.473 --> 00:19:24.710
of importance that they may have
for him.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:29.632
It starts then with,
"In the hour when the

00:19:29.632 --> 00:19:33.114
day's heat,
overcome by the earth and

00:19:33.114 --> 00:19:37.173
sometimes by Saturn,
can no longer temper the cold

00:19:37.173 --> 00:19:40.855
of the moon,
when the geomancers see their

00:19:40.855 --> 00:19:46.344
Fortuna Major rise in the east
before dawn by a path which does

00:19:46.344 --> 00:19:52.145
not long stay dark for it,
there came to me in dream a

00:19:52.145 --> 00:19:57.488
woman stammering,
cross-eyed and crooked on her

00:19:57.488 --> 00:20:02.019
feet with maimed hands and of
sallow hue.

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:05.827
I gazed at her,
and as the sun revives cold

00:20:05.827 --> 00:20:11.152
limbs benumbed by the night,
so my look gave her a ready

00:20:11.152 --> 00:20:14.585
tongue,
and then in a little time made

00:20:14.585 --> 00:20:19.950
her quite erect and colored her
wan features as love desires.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:24.172
When she had her speech thus
set free she began to sing so

00:20:24.172 --> 00:20:28.838
that it would have been hard for
me to turn my mind from her.

00:20:28.838 --> 00:20:33.082
'I am,' she sang,
'I am the sweet siren who

00:20:33.082 --> 00:20:39.241
beguile the sailors in mid-sea,
so great delight it is to hear

00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:39.950
me.
 

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.328
I turned Ulysses,
eager on his way,

00:20:43.328 --> 00:20:48.396
to my song and he who dwells
with me rarely departs,

00:20:48.396 --> 00:20:51.279
so wholly I content him.'
 

00:20:51.279 --> 00:20:56.468
Her lips were not yet closed
again when a lady,

00:20:56.468 --> 00:21:01.432
holy and alert,
appeared beside me to put her

00:21:01.432 --> 00:21:03.348
to confusion.
 

00:21:03.348 --> 00:21:06.819
'Oh Virgil, Virgil,
who is this?'

00:21:06.819 --> 00:21:08.700
she said with anger.
 

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.269
And he came with his eyes fixed
on the honorable one;

00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:15.711
he seized the other and laid
her bare in front,

00:21:15.711 --> 00:21:19.230
tearing her clothes,
and showed me her belly.

00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:24.650
That awoke me with the stench
that came from her.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:27.440
I turned my eyes to the good
Master.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.720
'Three times at least I have
called thee,' he said,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.411
'rise and come,
let us find the opening by

00:21:33.411 --> 00:21:35.380
which thou enterest."
 

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:40.257
That's the end of the dream,
the account of the dream,

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:45.501
and this is also--the journey
will continue that seemed to

00:21:45.501 --> 00:21:49.000
have come to a halt here at
night.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.416
As you recall,
just to give you a sense of

00:21:52.416 --> 00:21:57.001
Dante's ordered poetic mind,
this is the second of three

00:21:57.001 --> 00:21:57.920
dreams.
 

00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:05.038
We didn't really read the first
one about--in Canto IX,

00:22:05.038 --> 00:22:08.730
was the dream of Ganymede.
 

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:12.255
Dante's moving from the
anti-Purgatory to Purgatory

00:22:12.255 --> 00:22:15.522
proper and then it's the--
the third one will appear in

00:22:15.522 --> 00:22:17.689
Canto XXVII,
so that really Dante is

00:22:17.689 --> 00:22:21.720
scanning these three dreams with
also a sense of numerical--

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.410
symbolic numerical precision
IX, XVIII,

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:31.405
retold in XIX,
but takes place during the

00:22:31.405 --> 00:22:34.279
night and then XXVII.
 

00:22:34.279 --> 00:22:39.461
This is the--it's a dream,
it's a dream that happens at

00:22:39.461 --> 00:22:41.828
dawn,
just some details,

00:22:41.828 --> 00:22:47.069
and a dream at dawn has always
the value they believed of it

00:22:47.069 --> 00:22:50.180
being a kind of prophetic dream.
 

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.218
It's a dream that really has a
sort of a hue,

00:22:54.218 --> 00:22:56.328
a color of the truth.
 

00:22:56.328 --> 00:23:00.630
It says something about--so if
you understand the dream as an

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.640
allegory say,
because it's about a veil.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.410
It's about tearing clothes.
 

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:08.722
There is something hidden
underneath it all,

00:23:08.722 --> 00:23:12.500
then it may be this allegory
has a truth value.

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.288
It's not some kind of mere
fable or other.

00:23:17.288 --> 00:23:23.509
Dante starts evoking the planet
Saturn which is--

00:23:23.509 --> 00:23:29.125
we shall see that in--you know
that Dante mentions planets and

00:23:29.125 --> 00:23:32.900
joins them to the various
liberal arts.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:35.318
I probably have mentioned this
before.

00:23:35.318 --> 00:23:38.183
So when we will be talking
about the moon,

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:40.700
Dante is going to discuss
grammar.

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.102
He'll talk about Mars,
the planet of war,

00:23:44.102 --> 00:23:47.078
and there he'll talk about
music.

00:23:47.078 --> 00:23:51.500
Jupiter and justice,
Saturn is astronomy,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.368
also the planet of
contemplation.

00:23:55.368 --> 00:23:58.931
In this sense,
I think that he's hinting that

00:23:58.931 --> 00:24:03.300
sloth is the obverse side,
the parody of contemplation,

00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:07.509
a different type of
self-absorption nonetheless.

00:24:07.509 --> 00:24:10.357
Not a way of breaking out,
the contemplation means

00:24:10.357 --> 00:24:13.787
breaking out of one's self and
reach some kind of--the gates

00:24:13.787 --> 00:24:14.950
outside of time.
 

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:19.088
Here it's a dream that seems to
be--a movement,

00:24:19.088 --> 00:24:22.420
an inward movement,
so it's Saturn.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.372
Then he continues with this
language of astronomy and

00:24:25.372 --> 00:24:28.891
divination who "no longer
temper the cold of the moon when

00:24:28.891 --> 00:24:31.558
the geomancers see the Fortuna
Major."

00:24:31.558 --> 00:24:34.750
This is a process of knowledge,
as divination.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:37.913
That's a different type of
rational knowledge,

00:24:37.913 --> 00:24:39.108
divining signs.
 

00:24:39.108 --> 00:24:42.221
This is the context in which
the dream is set:

00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:46.231
"rise in the east before
dawn by a path which does not

00:24:46.231 --> 00:24:49.365
long stay dark for it,
there came to me in a

00:24:49.365 --> 00:24:50.150
dream."
 

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.690
Now the dream starts.
 

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:57.740
The first thing that I have to
point out to you is that in

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.730
this--in the dream,
the dreamer is an object.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.088
The dream comes to him.
 

00:25:05.088 --> 00:25:08.693
Clearly, it is not willed,
it's not something that he

00:25:08.693 --> 00:25:10.220
decides or he wants.
 

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.597
One is the object of some
dreams or apparitions,

00:25:14.597 --> 00:25:20.000
or signs, images that descend
into one's self without one's

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.098
own self control or dominion
over there.

00:25:24.098 --> 00:25:28.603
Dante seems to place himself in
a condition of passivity which

00:25:28.603 --> 00:25:30.670
is the passivity of sloth.
 

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:35.240
The idea that I am awake and
therefore vigilant,

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:39.938
and therefore capable of making
judgments about what's happening

00:25:39.938 --> 00:25:41.650
to me,
is here, now,

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.130
for the time being,
bracketed.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:46.588
What is this dream about though?
 

00:25:46.588 --> 00:25:51.026
Well it's a dream of a woman,
and the Italian text

00:25:51.026 --> 00:25:55.009
plays--since this is a dream
about two women,

00:25:55.009 --> 00:25:58.269
two modes of being,
two choices.

00:25:58.269 --> 00:26:03.036
It's almost as if he were--he
isn't, but you know this is the

00:26:03.036 --> 00:26:06.292
mythography of Hercules,
as they call him,

00:26:06.292 --> 00:26:08.278
at the crossing road.
 

00:26:08.278 --> 00:26:10.308
He had to choose between vice
and virtue,

00:26:10.308 --> 00:26:15.230
but Hercules has an easy time
because he's always going to be

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.472
right: in thinking mythography,
if you go to the right then you

00:26:19.472 --> 00:26:21.394
really have--
by going toward virtue,

00:26:21.394 --> 00:26:24.211
left and right,
being dexterous rather than

00:26:24.211 --> 00:26:27.848
sinister,
the idea of the left being bad.

00:26:27.848 --> 00:26:30.866
Here we don't have that,
here's two women,

00:26:30.866 --> 00:26:34.988
but the language of the poem
distinguishes very carefully

00:26:34.988 --> 00:26:36.240
between them.
 

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.397
One is a femmina,
there is materiality and even a

00:26:40.397 --> 00:26:43.118
kind of animal sense of the
word,

00:26:43.118 --> 00:26:46.272
and when the other woman
appears, she's called a

00:26:46.272 --> 00:26:50.757
donna;
donna is the Italian

00:26:50.757 --> 00:26:57.838
word from domina,
the lady is called a holy lady,

00:26:57.838 --> 00:27:04.150
I guess, "lady holy and
alert," etc.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:09.817
She is--this woman,
she crystallizes what we would

00:27:09.817 --> 00:27:13.750
call the aesthetics of the ugly.
 

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:18.260
We're always talking about the
beauty and the idea that beauty

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:21.810
brings about a kind of
revelation of love and the

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:24.400
pleasure that goes with beauty.
 

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:30.034
In fact, one can say that
love--no?--this is a Platonic

00:27:30.034 --> 00:27:36.190
way of understanding love has
always a hunger for beauty.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:40.096
The conventional way of
thinking about aesthetics is to

00:27:40.096 --> 00:27:42.990
imagine beautiful proportionate
forms.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:45.442
Here, Dante is giving exactly
the opposite,

00:27:45.442 --> 00:27:47.019
an aesthetic of the ugly.
 

00:27:47.019 --> 00:27:51.157
But an ugly which is not static
and somehow is--experiences

00:27:51.157 --> 00:27:52.298
metamorphosis.
 

00:27:52.298 --> 00:27:55.058
In fact, look what happens,
she is "stammering,

00:27:55.058 --> 00:27:58.375
cross-eyed, and crooked on her
feet," she is the

00:27:58.375 --> 00:28:02.233
anti-Beatrice by--
obviously, "with maimed

00:28:02.233 --> 00:28:04.818
hands and sallow hue."
 

00:28:04.818 --> 00:28:08.488
Now he changes:
from the dreamer as an object,

00:28:08.488 --> 00:28:12.318
the dreamer becomes a subject,
"I."

00:28:12.318 --> 00:28:13.570
You see that,
from "..

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:14.630
.came to me..."
 

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:18.731
and then, "I gazed at her,
and as the soul revives cold

00:28:18.731 --> 00:28:22.210
limbs benumbed by the night,
so my look..."

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:27.825
His desires transform this
image, and from the ugly image

00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:32.050
that it was,
it becomes now instead invested

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:36.440
with attributes of
attractiveness and "colored

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.776
her wan features as love
desires,"

00:28:39.776 --> 00:28:41.618
as love prompts.
 

00:28:41.618 --> 00:28:44.519
Then this is what--we still
don't understand who she is.

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:46.798
"When she had her speech
thus set free,

00:28:46.798 --> 00:28:50.648
she began to sing so that it
would have been hard for me to

00:28:50.648 --> 00:28:52.640
turn my mind from her."
 

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.223
The first temptation that we
know that--the vehicle of the

00:28:56.223 --> 00:28:57.858
temptation--is the song.
 

00:28:57.858 --> 00:28:59.827
This is also,
and primarily,

00:28:59.827 --> 00:29:01.430
a poetic temptation.
 

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.424
A certain way of understanding
poetry, a kind of even

00:29:05.424 --> 00:29:07.730
meretricious form of poetry.
 

00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:08.680
What does she say?
 

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:14.712
She brings to center stage the
myth of Ulysses,

00:29:14.712 --> 00:29:22.057
which is by now as you know,
is the steady temptation for

00:29:22.057 --> 00:29:23.368
Dante.
 

00:29:23.368 --> 00:29:26.782
It's the point of reference:
to what extent is my own

00:29:26.782 --> 00:29:30.919
journey that I believe is taking
place under the aegis of divine

00:29:30.919 --> 00:29:33.863
providence,
to what extent is it a form of

00:29:33.863 --> 00:29:34.808
transgression?
 

00:29:34.808 --> 00:29:38.422
A way of going beyond
boundaries, of breaking down all

00:29:38.422 --> 00:29:42.920
limits, because after all that's
what Ulysses did in Canto XXVI.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.608
And Dante knows where he has
placed him, but he cannot get

00:29:46.608 --> 00:29:50.167
him out of his mind because
Ulysses stands for something

00:29:50.167 --> 00:29:51.009
powerful.
 

00:29:51.009 --> 00:29:55.942
What he stands for is the idea
that there is no knowledge worth

00:29:55.942 --> 00:30:00.160
having which is not connected
with transgressions,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.535
which is not connected with
breaking down all barriers and

00:30:04.535 --> 00:30:05.608
limitations.
 

00:30:05.608 --> 00:30:10.519
In a way, because Dante doesn't
do these things accidentally,

00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:13.210
when he comes to Canto XXVI of
Paradise,

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.664
he will see Adam,
and there is another who is for

00:30:16.664 --> 00:30:18.174
him,
without a doubt,

00:30:18.174 --> 00:30:20.500
a poet, because he's the name
giver.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:22.190
He is the name giver of the
world.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.971
He is the one who brings the
world into being through

00:30:24.971 --> 00:30:25.558
language.
 

00:30:25.558 --> 00:30:28.750
And when Dante meets Adam,
there will be some interesting

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.028
details that we can talk about
there,

00:30:31.028 --> 00:30:35.281
but I can anticipate this for
you: Adam is the one who had

00:30:35.281 --> 00:30:39.608
understood transgression and
that transgression though,

00:30:39.608 --> 00:30:41.308
for Adam, appears as a sort of
growth.

00:30:41.308 --> 00:30:44.480
It's not a fall,
for Dante, it's a growth.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.009
It's a growth and understanding
other types of limitations

00:30:48.009 --> 00:30:51.598
because we cannot just say that
we tear down all limits;

00:30:51.598 --> 00:30:53.920
we tear down some limits in our
experience.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:31:00.369
Adam tears down and eats of the
fruit of the tree that had been

00:31:00.369 --> 00:31:04.220
forbidden for him,
like a good son.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:07.041
The Father says,
don't eat it and he goes and

00:31:07.041 --> 00:31:11.019
eats it, and thence he eats it,
he grows into a human being.

00:31:11.019 --> 00:31:15.132
He discovers that the world is
not for him to be as a child,

00:31:15.132 --> 00:31:18.337
that he has to have other
experiences of death,

00:31:18.337 --> 00:31:20.430
of maturity,
of work, etc.

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.961
There are ways in which we have
to understand this idea of

00:31:23.961 --> 00:31:27.555
breaking limits in a different
way from maybe the way I may

00:31:27.555 --> 00:31:29.288
have conveyed it to you.
 

00:31:29.288 --> 00:31:30.598
In other words,
Dante, here,

00:31:30.598 --> 00:31:33.460
is thinking of Ulysses and
anticipates the story of Adam.

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:37.664
The great temptation for Dante
is to believe that he too--his

00:31:37.664 --> 00:31:41.450
journey is a journey that
reenacts Ulysses' journey.

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.143
The siren--that's what she's
telling him--what she's telling

00:31:45.143 --> 00:31:47.210
him is, 'I made Ulysses happy.'
 

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:51.028
It's a lie, because we do know
that Ulysses never really

00:31:51.028 --> 00:31:55.680
stopped off the island of Capri
in whose Grotto where the siren,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.470
is mythologically said to
reside.

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:02.740
We do know that he did listen
to the song of the siren;

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.351
he made sure that his
companions would not,

00:32:05.351 --> 00:32:07.028
and he had himself bound.
 

00:32:07.028 --> 00:32:11.038
Here it is again,
bound to the mast of the ship.

00:32:11.038 --> 00:32:15.982
There is a transgression and a
binding going on at the same

00:32:15.982 --> 00:32:16.578
time.
 

00:32:16.578 --> 00:32:19.500
As I said--at any rate,
she lies about,

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:23.630
"I turned Ulysses,
eager on his way to my song,

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:26.858
and he who dwells with
me," so the first--

00:32:26.858 --> 00:32:31.404
the other lie or the extension
of the lie is that the siren is

00:32:31.404 --> 00:32:35.279
making false promises of
happiness to the dreamer.

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:39.681
What she's saying is,
you stay here with me and I am

00:32:39.681 --> 00:32:42.529
the end of all that you desire.
 

00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:45.316
I am going to give you all the
pleasures that you want,

00:32:45.316 --> 00:32:47.535
and therefore,
your journey may very well be

00:32:47.535 --> 00:32:48.000
over.
 

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.048
If you are weary of the road,
this is the place where you

00:32:51.048 --> 00:32:51.808
should stop.
 

00:32:51.808 --> 00:32:54.130
We have another figure that
emerges.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:57.269
Clearly, the antagonist of the
siren,

00:32:57.269 --> 00:33:00.134
we don't know who she is,
we'll find out very quickly in

00:33:00.134 --> 00:33:02.740
Canto XXX and XXXI,
because the same scene will be

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.740
re-enacted with the arrival of
Beatrice.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:10.361
We imagine that here too,
we have force to imagine,

00:33:10.361 --> 00:33:13.960
that here too she is Beatrice.
 

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:17.950
"Her lips were not yet
closed again when a lady holy

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:21.013
and alert,"
a woman in the sense of not

00:33:21.013 --> 00:33:24.153
femmina,
"appeared beside me to put

00:33:24.153 --> 00:33:25.150
her to confusion.
 

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.085
'O Virgil, Virgil,
who is this?' she said with

00:33:27.085 --> 00:33:28.588
anger" and he came with
her.

00:33:28.588 --> 00:33:31.528
What is the difference between
them, between these two women?

00:33:31.528 --> 00:33:33.990
They are two different forms of
poetry.

00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:37.913
Now we understand why Dante had
to be talking about the

00:33:37.913 --> 00:33:42.335
imagination all along,
because this is really what

00:33:42.335 --> 00:33:48.029
will introduce him to the stakes
in claiming to be a poet.

00:33:48.029 --> 00:33:50.009
This is what he's been talking
about--

00:33:50.009 --> 00:33:52.380
the actual faculty of himself
as a poet,

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.940
and the cantos that will come,
XXI, XXII to XXVI and XXVII

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.940
constitute the most important
segment about ways of

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:05.326
understanding literary history,
literary tradition,

00:34:05.326 --> 00:34:09.847
or the place of originality
within that particular history

00:34:09.847 --> 00:34:10.880
and so on.
 

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.119
We are going to enter the world
of poetry more directly.

00:34:14.119 --> 00:34:18.070
So they are two different women;
they speak two different voices.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:22.760
One sweet, meretricious and
false, but a sweet song;

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:26.681
the other one very harsh,
who says the journey is not

00:34:26.681 --> 00:34:27.210
over.
 

00:34:27.210 --> 00:34:32.219
One forecloses the journey
of--and the quest of Dante.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:35.016
Be like Ulysses,
I know that you want to be like

00:34:35.016 --> 00:34:38.764
Ulysses, you can stay here with
me, and I am the end of all your

00:34:38.764 --> 00:34:40.489
journeys and your quests.
 

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.170
The other one is claiming
exactly the opposite.

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.280
The journey has to continue.
 

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.831
These two types of songs,
the song of the siren is sweet,

00:34:49.831 --> 00:34:54.059
which has also the stench of
death attached to it.

00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:56.570
The stench of the decomposition
of her body,

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.590
and on the other hand,
a journey by this austere

00:34:59.590 --> 00:35:01.842
voice,
the voice of--maybe the voice

00:35:01.842 --> 00:35:05.277
of love,
the voice of harshness,

00:35:05.277 --> 00:35:12.610
just the language of sweetness
is that of love as an ongoing

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:13.730
quest.
 

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.179
That's what she's saying.
 

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:18.123
Two forms of love,
two forms of poetry,

00:35:18.123 --> 00:35:19.750
two types of women.
 

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:23.782
The scene, in case you are
interested in this--as many of

00:35:23.782 --> 00:35:28.030
you I'm sure have thought about
it--literally are stages.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.911
The scene at the beginning of
The Consolation of

00:35:31.911 --> 00:35:37.239
Philosophy of Boethius,
which in turn is thinking about

00:35:37.239 --> 00:35:41.302
the Book X of the
Republic by Plato:

00:35:41.302 --> 00:35:46.721
the idea of the place of love
and the place of poetry and

00:35:46.721 --> 00:35:48.269
philosophy.
 

00:35:48.269 --> 00:35:50.369
Dante changes that tradition.
 

00:35:50.369 --> 00:35:53.389
This is not just poetry versus
philosophy;

00:35:53.389 --> 00:35:55.860
it's two different types of
poetry.

00:35:55.860 --> 00:36:00.239
Poetry can be also a
philosophical poetry.

00:36:00.239 --> 00:36:05.077
Poetry can be meretricious and
poetry can be also the sort of

00:36:05.077 --> 00:36:09.512
rigorous, severe form of
investigation of oneself in the

00:36:09.512 --> 00:36:10.320
world.
 

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:13.072
Two different types of poetry,
two different types of loves,

00:36:13.072 --> 00:36:14.519
two different types of women.
 

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:16.559
Which of the two is better?
 

00:36:16.559 --> 00:36:20.670
How can we go on deciding that
one is better than the other?

00:36:20.670 --> 00:36:24.469
Is there an objective pattern,
an objective criterion,

00:36:24.469 --> 00:36:28.483
by which we can say Beatrice,
is actually better than the

00:36:28.483 --> 00:36:29.199
siren?
 

00:36:29.199 --> 00:36:34.373
Does Dante--is Dante aware of
this idea of--yes,

00:36:34.373 --> 00:36:39.106
and the reason is going to be
the following,

00:36:39.106 --> 00:36:43.510
very simple:
the avoidance of death.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:47.710
The siren is the figure that
stands for death.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:51.750
Underneath the pleasures of her
language, there is a stench that

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:54.380
emanates from underneath that
allegory.

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:59.773
Dante sees the danger of
closing and the danger of making

00:36:59.773 --> 00:37:03.476
the here and now,
and the limitations of the here

00:37:03.476 --> 00:37:05.954
and now,
and the limitations of that

00:37:05.954 --> 00:37:08.000
song the end of his journey.
 

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.452
It's really a choice between an
open-ended quest and the

00:37:12.452 --> 00:37:14.639
foreclosure of the siren.
 

00:37:14.639 --> 00:37:19.443
This is the only way in which
you can objectively believe that

00:37:19.443 --> 00:37:23.775
there is a hierarchy between
these two loves and between

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:25.349
these two women.
 

00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:31.195
We move to Canto XXI and XXII,
but I'm wondering if I

00:37:31.195 --> 00:37:37.489
shouldn't take a few questions
here about this canto,

00:37:37.489 --> 00:37:41.309
or any other problems,
before we move onto something a

00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:44.599
little bit more--
a little bit different,

00:37:44.599 --> 00:37:48.271
more classical:
the encounter between Statius

00:37:48.271 --> 00:37:49.440
and Virgil.
 

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:54.940
Let me see if there are some
questions now about this phase,

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:58.947
these cantos,
or would you like to--me to go

00:37:58.947 --> 00:38:03.329
on and then maybe we can come
back to them?

00:38:03.329 --> 00:38:06.251
Student:  Are we
supposed to draw a connection

00:38:06.251 --> 00:38:08.329
between Casella and
anti-Purgatory?

00:38:08.329 --> 00:38:10.139
Prof: Very good.
 

00:38:10.139 --> 00:38:11.159
Say again?
 

00:38:11.159 --> 00:38:13.443
Student:  Are we
supposed to draw a connection

00:38:13.443 --> 00:38:14.849
between Casella and the siren?
 

00:38:14.849 --> 00:38:16.920
Prof: The question is
excellent.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:22.050
Are we supposed to draw some
connection between this scene

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:26.460
and the scene of Casella in
Canto II, above all of

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:27.719
Purgatory?
 

00:38:27.719 --> 00:38:30.679
I call it excellent,
because I agree you are

00:38:30.679 --> 00:38:34.329
supposed to--and it's the
reappearance under different

00:38:34.329 --> 00:38:36.670
guises of the same temptation.
 

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:41.418
How the aesthetic can become
both a way of gathering people

00:38:41.418 --> 00:38:42.730
around itself.
 

00:38:42.730 --> 00:38:45.280
That's the famous story of
Casella,

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.449
the power of the song just
collects,

00:38:49.449 --> 00:38:53.713
gathers, but at the same time
it induces us all to

00:38:53.713 --> 00:38:57.978
forgetfulness of whatever
purposes those souls are

00:38:57.978 --> 00:39:01.460
supposed to entertain and carry
out.

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:06.670
The difference of course is
that it's the same story here

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:10.858
now, the difference is not
between, let's say,

00:39:10.858 --> 00:39:15.420
Casella and others with the
language of Cato.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.880
Here it's more an
autobio--directly,

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.610
we are moved into the
consciousness of the pilgrim.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:25.489
We have entered this--as deep
as we can into his unconscious

00:39:25.489 --> 00:39:25.949
mind.
 

00:39:25.949 --> 00:39:29.650
This is the moment of what--he
comes to an amazing

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.010
self-revelation.
 

00:39:31.010 --> 00:39:36.358
The story of Casella had the
ring of a public discourse:

00:39:36.358 --> 00:39:41.318
poetry as a public act,
gathering a number of people

00:39:41.318 --> 00:39:42.679
around it.
 

00:39:42.679 --> 00:39:44.949
So this is very good.
 

00:39:44.949 --> 00:39:46.820
That's--thank you for
mentioning that.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:50.449
By the way, I don't know that
I--we never probably read it,

00:39:50.449 --> 00:39:53.762
but if you read the beginning,
I think I read it in Italian

00:39:53.762 --> 00:39:57.188
for Professor Brooks as I know
she likes the Provençal

00:39:57.188 --> 00:39:59.960
song,
but the beginning of Canto

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:04.697
XVIII also that moment of the
nostalgia for the safety of

00:40:04.697 --> 00:40:09.547
home,
the weariness of--the evening

00:40:09.547 --> 00:40:11.099
song, etc.
 

00:40:11.099 --> 00:40:16.327
That represents another version
of the same kind of dilemma with

00:40:16.327 --> 00:40:19.150
which the pilgrim is confronted.
 

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:28.710
Okay, we can come back to some
of this.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:35.572
We move into this segment of
the poem: XXI,

00:40:35.572 --> 00:40:44.396
XXII going through XXIII,
XXIV, which really has poetry

00:40:44.396 --> 00:40:49.300
now as the subject matter.
 

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:53.740
Dante begins with,
let's say, the classical

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:55.010
tradition.
 

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:59.260
The relationship between an
encounter that takes place,

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.920
wherein they,
in the world of avarice and

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.791
prodigality,
the encounter between Statius

00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:06.980
and Virgil.
 

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:12.300
As you know Statius views
himself as a disciple of Virgil,

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:16.780
and in many ways he challenges
Virgil's ideology,

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.739
Virgil's thought.
 

00:41:18.739 --> 00:41:22.050
Whereas Virgil can go on
writing a poem,

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:24.510
the Aeneid and the
Eclogues,

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:29.510
which are about the pastoral
world,

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.822
or the Georgics,
this world about the

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:35.076
cultivation of the earth,
where Virgil appears at his

00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:36.239
most anti-Orphic.
 

00:41:36.239 --> 00:41:40.873
He distinguishes and distances
himself from the traditional of

00:41:40.873 --> 00:41:44.567
Orpheus,
the poet of mad love who

00:41:44.567 --> 00:41:49.329
descends into the depths of
Hades and,

00:41:49.329 --> 00:41:54.900
of course, is waylaid by the
mad love for Eurydices--

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.610
the way of conquering death
through the song.

00:41:57.610 --> 00:42:02.311
He believes that through--by
singing he can bend the laws of

00:42:02.311 --> 00:42:05.420
death and therefore gain
immortality.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:12.199
Virgil opposes the world of
work, the world of mature--

00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:16.945
the responsible world of
Aeneas, the hero who is so

00:42:16.945 --> 00:42:22.556
divided against himself,
and yet manages to always find

00:42:22.556 --> 00:42:26.719
his way around in this kind of
wriggly,

00:42:26.719 --> 00:42:30.300
erratic path of his epic.
 

00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:34.389
Statius counters Virgil.
 

00:42:34.389 --> 00:42:37.670
Statius writes the
Thebaid, he writes another--

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:39.809
which he never
finishes--another little epic,

00:42:39.809 --> 00:42:42.429
called the Achilleid,
a story about Achilles,

00:42:42.429 --> 00:42:43.840
but it's only a fragment.
 

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.485
He writes the Thebaid,
which really goes against those

00:42:47.485 --> 00:42:48.639
claims of Virgil.
 

00:42:48.639 --> 00:42:53.335
He retrieves--makes a
conjunction between tragedy and

00:42:53.335 --> 00:42:57.195
the epic,
the world of Jocasta and

00:42:57.195 --> 00:43:01.940
Oedipus, the monstrosity of that
world,

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.400
the world of Polyneices and the
Eteocles,

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:10.135
the world of Antigone,
cast as a kind of nightmarish

00:43:10.135 --> 00:43:10.880
world.
 

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:15.398
It's literally the most
psychological of these epics,

00:43:15.398 --> 00:43:19.657
the wars that happen in the
mind, and this idea of

00:43:19.657 --> 00:43:23.829
monstrosity of human fate and
human desires.

00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:27.686
These are the two worlds that
Dante now wants to bring

00:43:27.686 --> 00:43:31.469
together in this little
epyllion, I would call it.

00:43:31.469 --> 00:43:33.061
"Epyllion"
is a Greek word meaning a

00:43:33.061 --> 00:43:35.742
'little epic,' that is to say,
a transcription of two epic

00:43:35.742 --> 00:43:38.320
texts gathered into one,
into a lyrical form.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.641
He has a tough task because
what he wants to show is the

00:43:42.641 --> 00:43:47.516
possibility of harmonizing the
two of them and he shows how the

00:43:47.516 --> 00:43:50.659
two of them really talk as
friends,

00:43:50.659 --> 00:43:54.268
friends across time of course.
 

00:43:54.268 --> 00:43:59.898
Statius lives around the year
70 A.D., Virgil dies in the year

00:43:59.898 --> 00:44:00.360
19.
 

00:44:00.360 --> 00:44:04.679
And now they are friends
because poetry has managed--

00:44:04.679 --> 00:44:10.173
their poetry has made them--the
poetry of Virgil has made them

00:44:10.173 --> 00:44:15.398
friends and Statius is a sort of
classical version of Dante

00:44:15.398 --> 00:44:16.480
himself.
 

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:19.297
Dante is the disciple of Virgil
and so was Statius,

00:44:19.297 --> 00:44:21.268
so he has to bring them
together.

00:44:21.268 --> 00:44:23.909
But it's not a question of
making them agree,

00:44:23.909 --> 00:44:26.489
only because they had two
different visions,

00:44:26.489 --> 00:44:29.849
that in and of itself may not
be all that difficult.

00:44:29.849 --> 00:44:35.849
Statius is very skeptical about
the Empire, Virgil is not all

00:44:35.849 --> 00:44:37.550
that skeptical.
 

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:40.795
It's possible to read the
Aeneid and see that there

00:44:40.795 --> 00:44:44.440
is a lot of ambiguity in the way
in which he talks about Augustus

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.726
and the Empire,
but he's basically writing the

00:44:47.726 --> 00:44:51.159
epic that justifies the ideology
of the Empire.

00:44:51.159 --> 00:44:53.780
The real difficulty between
them is that Dante is--

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:56.360
the real difficulty and
challenge for Dante--

00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:01.494
is that he has to try to
understand how Statius has

00:45:01.494 --> 00:45:04.987
tried--
to adjust Statius' vision of

00:45:04.987 --> 00:45:08.929
monstrosity to some of idea of
the sacred.

00:45:08.929 --> 00:45:10.630
This is the real challenge.
 

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:15.858
This is the difference that
Dante has from the classical

00:45:15.858 --> 00:45:16.619
world.
 

00:45:16.619 --> 00:45:18.880
How do we understand the sacred?
 

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:22.728
In what way is it possible to
use Statius, Virgil,

00:45:22.728 --> 00:45:27.204
as he already did with Cato,
who is by the way the hero of

00:45:27.204 --> 00:45:30.081
Lucan;
a third poet of this epic

00:45:30.081 --> 00:45:34.096
tradition, Virgil,
Lucan, Statius--is it possible

00:45:34.096 --> 00:45:39.449
to see in these texts of Statius
the seeds of something good?

00:45:39.449 --> 00:45:48.293
How can we build anything good
out of this vision of heroes and

00:45:48.293 --> 00:45:55.710
characters who fornicate with
their own fantasies?

00:45:55.710 --> 00:46:00.251
Who cannot really get out of
their minds, who just

00:46:00.251 --> 00:46:05.349
are--discover their own
unchanging submission to a force

00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:08.409
that transcends them to fate.
 

00:46:08.409 --> 00:46:11.880
It's really absolutely a
different world view from the

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.059
world of Virgil.
 

00:46:13.059 --> 00:46:17.449
Let me just go on a little bit
with XXI,

00:46:17.449 --> 00:46:22.480
I'll just start talking first
of all with--

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:33.518
Dante begins with an allusion
to this natural thirst,

00:46:33.518 --> 00:46:37.949
which is this world of--the
natural thirst for knowledge.

00:46:37.949 --> 00:46:40.639
It's really much the world of
the Banquet,

00:46:40.639 --> 00:46:42.039
the world of Aristotle.
 

00:46:42.039 --> 00:46:48.610
We have this incredible thirst
for knowledge and then this

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:52.300
figure called Statius appears.
 

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:59.173
We are also being told here
that nature, the natural world

00:46:59.173 --> 00:47:02.309
is mysteriously shaking.
 

00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:05.610
There's an earthquake,
because every time that a soul

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:08.657
gets liberated from the
purgatorial experience of

00:47:08.657 --> 00:47:11.748
expiation,
this purification and

00:47:11.748 --> 00:47:17.652
expiation, then the mountain
trembles and Statius can go on

00:47:17.652 --> 00:47:23.557
with them up to the Garden of
Eden and then Statius reveals

00:47:23.557 --> 00:47:28.139
himself and he will say around
line 60,

00:47:28.139 --> 00:47:32.286
"And I,
who have lain in this pain five

00:47:32.286 --> 00:47:37.110
hundred years and more,"
Statius speaking,

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:41.110
"felt but now my will free
for a better threshold,

00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:44.132
therefore thou didst feel the
earthquake and hear the devout

00:47:44.132 --> 00:47:47.001
spirits through the mountain
render praises to the Lord--

00:47:47.001 --> 00:47:47.768
soon."
 

00:47:47.768 --> 00:47:49.809
The resurrection has taken
place.

00:47:49.809 --> 00:47:54.208
This is going to be the
resurrection of Statius and

00:47:54.208 --> 00:47:55.000
Virgil.
 

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.253
It's Statius,
but also Virgil,

00:47:57.253 --> 00:47:59.039
and their own vision.
 

00:47:59.039 --> 00:48:04.050
So he goes on describing
himself, "In the time when

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.735
the good Titus,
the emperor,"

00:48:06.735 --> 00:48:10.208
he's evoking the time of the--
he's recalling the time of the

00:48:10.208 --> 00:48:13.324
destruction of the temple in
Jerusalem at a time when the

00:48:13.324 --> 00:48:15.985
good Titus,
"by help with the King

00:48:15.985 --> 00:48:18.760
most high avenged,"
means justice,

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.621
divine, the mysteries of
justice, "the wounds from

00:48:21.621 --> 00:48:24.750
which pour the blood sold by
Judas,' replied the spirit,

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:28.920
'I bore yonder the name that
most endures and honors most,

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.170
famous indeed,
but still without faith."

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.708
Statius a pagan,
really born again,

00:48:36.708 --> 00:48:44.449
this is the born again pagan
that appears in this canto.

00:48:44.449 --> 00:48:50.443
"So sweet was my spirit of
song that Rome drew me,"

00:48:50.443 --> 00:48:53.239
it's an interesting image.
 

00:48:53.239 --> 00:48:57.313
It's really speaking of Rome
having a kind of power that

00:48:57.313 --> 00:49:00.275
usually will lead with love,
with desire,

00:49:00.275 --> 00:49:01.980
the pull of desire.
 

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:07.038
Rome brought him to it,
to herself, "a Toulousan,

00:49:07.038 --> 00:49:12.382
to itself and there I was
worthy to have my brows adorned

00:49:12.382 --> 00:49:13.909
with myrtle.
 

00:49:13.909 --> 00:49:17.250
Men yonder still speak my name,
which is Statius;

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:20.914
and I sang of Thebes and then
of great Achilles,

00:49:20.914 --> 00:49:24.889
but fell by the way with the
second burden."

00:49:24.889 --> 00:49:27.460
He could never complete the
second text.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.239
Now look at the way he speaks
about poetry;

00:49:30.239 --> 00:49:34.579
he speaks through sparks,
as a kind of fire.

00:49:34.579 --> 00:49:40.224
"The sparks that kindled
the fire in me were from the

00:49:40.224 --> 00:49:43.585
divine flame,
the divine flame from which

00:49:43.585 --> 00:49:46.019
more than a thousand have been
lit--

00:49:46.019 --> 00:49:50.784
I mean the Aeneid"--
That's already--poetry now is

00:49:50.784 --> 00:49:52.809
invested with power.
 

00:49:52.809 --> 00:49:58.233
The power to light the fire in
the readers and in its

00:49:58.233 --> 00:50:04.699
followers, "which was in
poetry my mother and my nurse;

00:50:04.699 --> 00:50:09.829
without it I had not weighed a
drachm and to have lived yonder,

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:13.380
when Virgil lived I would have
contented to a sun more than I

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:16.460
was due before coming forth from
banishment."

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:19.820
There are two metaphors to
speak of poetry,

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:25.054
one is that of the sparks of
fire, and the second one is that

00:50:25.054 --> 00:50:30.360
of nourishing the inner hunger,
mother and nurse.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:35.286
It's nursing--the nursing of
its readers so a great

00:50:35.286 --> 00:50:40.902
acknowledgement of a master,
without his knowledge that it

00:50:40.902 --> 00:50:44.550
is Virgil to whom he is
speaking.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:49.121
And then Canto XXI which is
another image that may remind

00:50:49.121 --> 00:50:51.570
you of the story of Casella.
 

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:56.210
Statius reveals--Dante reveals
Statius identity,

00:50:56.210 --> 00:51:00.518
Virgil's identity to Statius,
and they try to--

00:51:00.518 --> 00:51:03.835
the two of them try to
embrace--"Already he was

00:51:03.835 --> 00:51:07.280
bending to embrace,"
lines 130 and following,

00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.079
"my Teacher's feet;
but he said to him,

00:51:10.079 --> 00:51:13.822
'Brother do not so,
for thou art a shade and a

00:51:13.822 --> 00:51:15.570
shade thou seest.'
 

00:51:15.570 --> 00:51:18.677
And he rising:
'Now thou canst understand the

00:51:18.677 --> 00:51:22.139
measure of the love that burns
in me for thee,

00:51:22.139 --> 00:51:26.152
when I forget our emptiness and
treat shades as solid

00:51:26.152 --> 00:51:27.309
things."
 

00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:33.315
A mistake that has been made
before and a mistake that I

00:51:33.315 --> 00:51:39.867
think is meant to convey the
claims or the illusions of poets

00:51:39.867 --> 00:51:46.420
to believe that there is some
kind of solidity to them,

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.909
and not just to their poetry,
to their works,

00:51:49.909 --> 00:51:55.059
but a solidity to them that
this embrace belies.

00:51:55.059 --> 00:51:56.269
There's no solidity to them.
 

00:51:56.269 --> 00:51:57.929
There is a kind of emptiness.
 

00:51:57.929 --> 00:52:01.760
There's a sort of distance
between the poets and their

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:02.340
works.
 

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:06.246
This is not going to,
I think, interfere very much

00:52:06.246 --> 00:52:10.311
because it's the works,
the works of art that we are

00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:13.820
going to be talking about in
Canto XXII.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:20.219
The two poets now are
self--each in acknowledgement of

00:52:20.219 --> 00:52:27.949
the other and they go on talking
about line 10 and following,

00:52:27.949 --> 00:52:37.755
Virgil asks Statius to explain
to him why this moral blight

00:52:37.755 --> 00:52:43.748
existed in him,
why this sin of avarice,

00:52:43.748 --> 00:52:46.739
and he says--
this is the passage:

00:52:46.739 --> 00:52:48.710
"Love,"
Canto XXII,

00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:52.132
lines 12 and following,
"Love kindled by virtue

00:52:52.132 --> 00:52:57.769
always kindles another"--
That's the sort of vitality and

00:52:57.769 --> 00:52:59.460
power of love.
 

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:04.356
It's not self-enclosed;
it's one that goes on creating

00:53:04.356 --> 00:53:06.739
and propagating itself.
 

00:53:06.739 --> 00:53:08.929
It has a generosity of its own.
 

00:53:08.929 --> 00:53:11.960
It has a kind of charitableness
of it's,

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:14.010
"if only its flame appear
without"--

00:53:14.010 --> 00:53:19.414
So fire and love seem to be
conjoined by this common

00:53:19.414 --> 00:53:23.260
element,
the common element of the power

00:53:23.260 --> 00:53:26.460
of propagation or
self-perpetuation.

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.639
"From the hour, therefore,
when Juvenal descended among us

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:33.554
in the LImbo of Hell and made
thy affection known to me my

00:53:33.554 --> 00:53:37.538
goodwill toward thee was as
great as ever held anyone for a

00:53:37.538 --> 00:53:40.677
person not seen,
so that now these stairs will

00:53:40.677 --> 00:53:41.690
seem short to me.
 

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:43.985
But tell me,
and as a friend,

00:53:43.985 --> 00:53:48.659
forgive me with too much
assurance I slacken the rein,

00:53:48.659 --> 00:53:51.630
and as a friend speak with me
know--

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:56.840
how could avarice find a place
in thy breast along with so much

00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.210
wisdom as by thy zeal thou wast
filled with?"

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:06.250
This is a passage of some
importance.

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:10.860
Because, first of all,
the claim of friendship between

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:15.905
Virgil--he's moved by the show
of friendship on the part of

00:54:15.905 --> 00:54:16.949
Statius.
 

00:54:16.949 --> 00:54:19.349
Let's talk now as friends.
 

00:54:19.349 --> 00:54:23.849
Friendship is an ethical virtue
as you know,

00:54:23.849 --> 00:54:28.679
in Aristotle's Ethics
and for Cicero,

00:54:28.679 --> 00:54:31.900
who writes a treatise called
On Friendship,

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.302
which Dante mentions at the
beginning of his philosophical

00:54:35.302 --> 00:54:37.239
text,
in the belief that friendship

00:54:37.239 --> 00:54:40.260
is really the other language the
other term for philosophy.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.494
It's the friend and the
philosopher that are

00:54:43.494 --> 00:54:47.557
interchangeable because there is
a love--in friendship,

00:54:47.557 --> 00:54:51.018
there is a love of truth that
is the idea.

00:54:51.018 --> 00:54:55.135
There is some exaggeration on
the part of Virgil because there

00:54:55.135 --> 00:54:58.913
is really--a friendship implies
some kind--some degree of

00:54:58.913 --> 00:54:59.789
equality.
 

00:54:59.789 --> 00:55:03.559
You must have--in order to be
friends you must have some idea,

00:55:03.559 --> 00:55:07.215
because in fact it's usually
said that tyrants and slaves are

00:55:07.215 --> 00:55:09.469
not capable of love or
friendship,

00:55:09.469 --> 00:55:13.690
because both--since one is the
inversion of the other--

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:18.336
both really have a kind of
inequality vis-à-vis the

00:55:18.336 --> 00:55:18.989
other.
 

00:55:18.989 --> 00:55:21.152
The slave is,
by definition inferior,

00:55:21.152 --> 00:55:24.577
the tyrant thinks that he's
superior so friendship demands

00:55:24.577 --> 00:55:26.139
that kind if equality.
 

00:55:26.139 --> 00:55:29.237
This is a little bit of
exaggeration because there is no

00:55:29.237 --> 00:55:30.760
equality between Statius.
 

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.820
It's a rhetorical exaggeration
of Statius and Virgil.

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:39.869
Virgil is--acknowledges being
superior to Statius.

00:55:39.869 --> 00:55:43.429
Statius sees himself as a
disciple and therefore views

00:55:43.429 --> 00:55:46.719
Virgil as superior from a poetic
point of view;

00:55:46.719 --> 00:55:50.190
from a theological point of
view Statius is superior to

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.768
Virgil.
 

00:55:50.768 --> 00:55:54.016
Statius is going on to
Paradise and Virgil is

00:55:54.016 --> 00:55:55.610
going to go back Limbo.
 

00:55:55.610 --> 00:56:01.742
So there is a kind of the push
in the direction of wishful

00:56:01.742 --> 00:56:05.940
thinking maybe on the part of
Virgil.

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:09.250
I must also add that Dante has
a kind of--

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:13.635
some work also to do about--he
may be aware that friendship was

00:56:13.635 --> 00:56:17.030
never really thought of as a
Christian virtue.

00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:21.128
It's a classical and pagan
virtue, and because it really

00:56:21.128 --> 00:56:25.900
confuses--it's the idea a friend
is always part of one's soul.

00:56:25.900 --> 00:56:28.389
It's really earthbound.
 

00:56:28.389 --> 00:56:34.690
It's an earthbound experience,
so it was always the

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:37.840
thought--not Augustine.
 

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.974
Augustine who has a friend
Alypius and feels responsible

00:56:40.974 --> 00:56:44.536
for Alypius,
but by and large--it was this

00:56:44.536 --> 00:56:50.322
idea that the friendship could
distract the mind from an ascent

00:56:50.322 --> 00:56:56.257
to higher and superior ends,
paradisiac ecstasies and

00:56:56.257 --> 00:56:57.610
pleasures.
 

00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:01.291
Dante has to be aware that
there were efforts to

00:57:01.291 --> 00:57:03.250
Christianize this idea.
 

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:05.858
Nonetheless,
it brings the conversation

00:57:05.858 --> 00:57:09.909
between them back to the earth
and they talk as if they were

00:57:09.909 --> 00:57:13.000
two friends really meeting in
the forum,

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:17.197
in the agora,
and chatting about their moral

00:57:17.197 --> 00:57:22.079
failings or their own poetic
crafts and visions.

00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:25.186
How could you find--how could
you be so avaricious,

00:57:25.186 --> 00:57:28.420
when you are so enlightened in
so many other ways?

00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:29.360
That's the question.
 

00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:33.795
Statius responds that he's not
avaricious and I think that that

00:57:33.795 --> 00:57:37.230
adds a great deal about their
understandings--

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:39.380
the misunderstandings of each
other--

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.280
but also their understandings
of poetry.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:45.820
He goes on talking about the
fact that he is prodigal all the

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:46.349
time.
 

00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:50.019
So that is to say that he--you
may remember from Canto VII of

00:57:50.019 --> 00:57:52.529
Inferno,
the difference between the

00:57:52.529 --> 00:57:55.159
avaricious and the sins of
prodigality.

00:57:55.159 --> 00:58:00.583
Prodigality was a violation of
the economy of goods by

00:58:00.583 --> 00:58:04.778
devaluing, by getting
rid--devaluing them,

00:58:04.778 --> 00:58:07.440
not holding onto them.
 

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:12.320
The avaricious overvalues the
goods and tries to heap--

00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:17.195
amass larger quantities of
goods, so he goes on really

00:58:17.195 --> 00:58:19.784
thinking--
Statius wants to make it clear

00:58:19.784 --> 00:58:22.210
for at least 40 lines about the
fact that he's--

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:27.090
he was prodigal and we have to
understand why he would say

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:27.690
that.
 

00:58:27.690 --> 00:58:30.157
Then in fact he goes on
acknowledging,

00:58:30.157 --> 00:58:33.360
once again, Statius,
for his moral conversion.

00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:36.250
So that's the first thing about
what poetry can do.

00:58:36.250 --> 00:58:39.766
"Know then that avarice
was too far removed from me,

00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:42.969
and this excess thousands of
moons have punished.

00:58:42.969 --> 00:58:46.847
And had it not been that I
corrected my ways when I

00:58:46.847 --> 00:58:50.367
understood the lines,
where as if enraged at human

00:58:50.367 --> 00:58:52.670
nature,
thou didst cry: "To what,

00:58:52.670 --> 00:58:57.056
O cursed hunger for gold,
dost thou not drive the

00:58:57.056 --> 00:58:59.159
appetite of mortals?'
 

00:58:59.159 --> 00:59:02.682
I should be rolling the weights
and know the dismal

00:59:02.682 --> 00:59:03.739
jousts."
 

00:59:03.739 --> 00:59:07.369
What he's saying is that he
read a passage in Book III of

00:59:07.369 --> 00:59:10.918
the Aeneid,
the story that we already saw

00:59:10.918 --> 00:59:14.577
of Polydorus,
who had been killed because

00:59:14.577 --> 00:59:20.478
of--they want to rob him of his
gold and Statius reached a moral

00:59:20.478 --> 00:59:21.789
conversion.
 

00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:26.110
There's a lot we can say about
these lines.

00:59:26.110 --> 00:59:30.347
First of all,
I think this exemplifies how we

00:59:30.347 --> 00:59:36.030
actually read and we dismember
the integrity of the text.

00:59:36.030 --> 00:59:38.340
We take out of a book,
out of a passage,

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:45.969
that which we find relevant to
us and he takes some lines,

00:59:45.969 --> 00:59:49.882
and not only takes some lines
from the Book III of the

00:59:49.882 --> 00:59:53.260
Aeneid,
he also alters their meaning.

00:59:53.260 --> 01:00:01.088
The original text of Virgil's
is exactly the opposite to

01:00:01.088 --> 01:00:09.771
what--why do you not contain the
appetite of mortals or sacred

01:00:09.771 --> 01:00:12.619
hunger for gold?
 

01:00:12.619 --> 01:00:14.119
Which the text translates as
'cursed'--

01:00:14.119 --> 01:00:17.329
because the word sacred,
which Dante is using here,

01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:20.820
why do you not contain,
"O sacred fame of

01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:24.079
gold" O sacra fame
dell'oro.

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:27.394
The word "sacred,"
as you probably know,

01:00:27.394 --> 01:00:30.170
some of you may know,
means two things.

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:33.018
It's the most ambiguous term
that you--

01:00:33.018 --> 01:00:37.342
semantically speaking--because
it can describe both that which

01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:40.126
we call the holy,
and that which we call the

01:00:40.126 --> 01:00:40.599
profane.
 

01:00:40.599 --> 01:00:43.340
It joins them together:
there's no clear-cut

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:46.400
distinction between the
profanation or blasphemy,

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.460
on the other hand,
or the sense of holiness.

01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:53.090
I can understand why my
translation, Sinclair,

01:00:53.090 --> 01:00:56.643
my translator,
decides to choose the 'cursed'

01:00:56.643 --> 01:01:00.840
instead of call it 'sacred,' for
it's the curse.

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:03.726
He's dismembering,
he is taking one side

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:07.503
over--there's a much more
complicated version of the

01:01:07.503 --> 01:01:09.280
meaning of the word.
 

01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:12.972
So that's one thing,
but the poetic text of Virgil

01:01:12.972 --> 01:01:17.570
has a moral power over and
against Virgil's own intentions.

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:20.907
We can understand now
retrospectively why Dante has to

01:01:20.907 --> 01:01:23.679
distinguish between poets and
their works.

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:27.778
We can read the works
regardless of the intentions of

01:01:27.778 --> 01:01:32.824
the authors and we can select or
take out of those texts whatever

01:01:32.824 --> 01:01:37.806
we think that we--
however we think that they

01:01:37.806 --> 01:01:45.550
speak to us and then he goes on
describing his poetic growth.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:51.244
"Now," lines 55,
"Now, when thou did sing

01:01:51.244 --> 01:01:54.076
the cruel arms of the double woe
of Jocasta,"

01:01:54.076 --> 01:01:56.329
the double woe is the two
children,

01:01:56.329 --> 01:02:00.447
Eteocles and Polyneices,
in the tragic and epic text

01:02:00.447 --> 01:02:04.077
called the Thebaid,
"said the singer of the

01:02:04.077 --> 01:02:04.909
Bucolics."
 

01:02:04.909 --> 01:02:06.949
That's already the opposition.
 

01:02:06.949 --> 01:02:10.862
Virgil now appears as the
author of a pastoral poem,

01:02:10.862 --> 01:02:14.391
the Bucolics,
where rivalries are always

01:02:14.391 --> 01:02:16.309
going to be placated.
 

01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:19.588
The Bucolics of--the
pastoral poems of Virgil are

01:02:19.588 --> 01:02:20.960
always about rivalry.
 

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:26.733
A rivalry between two
shepherds: which of us they ask,

01:02:26.733 --> 01:02:29.239
is the better singer?
 

01:02:29.239 --> 01:02:30.659
Which of us is the better poet?
 

01:02:30.659 --> 01:02:34.349
That is always--there's never
any tragic outcome.

01:02:34.349 --> 01:02:38.800
There's some uneasiness,
some anxiety between in--

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.070
running through that kind of
debate between the poets,

01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:46.420
but it's not the rivalry of
Polyneices and Eteocles.

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:50.286
That's really the difference
that Dante is highlighting

01:02:50.286 --> 01:02:51.360
between them.
 

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.369
And then it continues, "...
 

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:59.014
it does not appear by the notes
which Clio touches with

01:02:59.014 --> 01:03:05.389
thee," the Bucolics,
and on other hand Clio is the

01:03:05.389 --> 01:03:07.480
muse of history.
 

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:10.786
So Clio is the muse for
history, the world of Statius,

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:14.280
"that the faith yet made
thee faithful without which

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.090
well-doing is not enough.
 

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:19.378
If that is so,
what sun or what candles

01:03:19.378 --> 01:03:23.878
dispelled thy darkness,
so that thereafter thou didst

01:03:23.878 --> 01:03:27.860
lift the sails behind the
fisherman?"

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:30.911
Now we know that what he's
really asking,

01:03:30.911 --> 01:03:34.268
in a general way,
is the relationship between

01:03:34.268 --> 01:03:35.869
poetry and faith.
 

01:03:35.869 --> 01:03:40.730
How could Statius--we know how
he reached this moral

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:44.733
conversion, now we have to be
told somehow,

01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:48.070
how did he go on finding faith?
 

01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:50.389
What is the relationship
between the two of them?

01:03:50.389 --> 01:03:57.190
Can poetry reveal and lead us
onto the world of faith or not?

01:03:57.190 --> 01:04:01.313
Statius has already--that's
really the answer that he will

01:04:01.313 --> 01:04:04.570
provide: "And the other
answered him,

01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:07.659
'Thou first directed me to
Parnassus,"

01:04:07.659 --> 01:04:09.500
the mountain of poetry.
 

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.920
The poetic experience,
the poetic apprenticeship,

01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.150
is the preamble to the
experience of faith--

01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:19.570
"to drink in its
caves"--

01:04:19.570 --> 01:04:24.797
a metaphor that picks up the
natural thirst of the previous

01:04:24.797 --> 01:04:26.853
canto,
"to drink in its caves

01:04:26.853 --> 01:04:29.739
and,
first, after God enlightens me.

01:04:29.739 --> 01:04:33.811
Thou didst like him that goes
by night and carries the light

01:04:33.811 --> 01:04:37.677
behind him and does not help
himself but makes wise those

01:04:37.677 --> 01:04:40.369
that follow when thou
saidst."

01:04:40.369 --> 01:04:43.989
In a moment we will see he
said, but the metaphor is that

01:04:43.989 --> 01:04:47.356
of really--
Virgil is a prophetic voice who

01:04:47.356 --> 01:04:50.606
speaks,
but that language he uses like

01:04:50.606 --> 01:04:53.385
the--
a lamp that he carries on his

01:04:53.385 --> 01:04:56.760
back for the benefit of those
who follow,

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.440
and himself clearly remains in
the dark.

01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.460
That's what he said.
 

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:04.722
"The age turns new again;
justice comes back and the

01:05:04.722 --> 01:05:08.327
primal years of men,
and a new race descends from

01:05:08.327 --> 01:05:09.530
heaven."
 

01:05:09.530 --> 01:05:13.480
This is the famous fourth
eclogue of Virgil,

01:05:13.480 --> 01:05:18.449
where Virgil is celebrating the
birth of a child,

01:05:18.449 --> 01:05:21.349
Pollio, and around this birth
of a child,

01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:25.329
he is also talking about the
rejuvenation of the world.

01:05:25.329 --> 01:05:28.896
It's an emblem,
Pollio's birth is an emblem for

01:05:28.896 --> 01:05:31.920
this Pythagorean vision that he
has,

01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:38.005
a vision whereby the world goes
through 360,000 years of the

01:05:38.005 --> 01:05:40.454
Golden Age,
the Silver Age,

01:05:40.454 --> 01:05:44.277
and so on, and then degrades
itself and goes right back to

01:05:44.277 --> 01:05:45.619
where it started.
 

01:05:45.619 --> 01:05:50.773
A Pythagorean vision of
metamorphosis and circulation of

01:05:50.773 --> 01:05:52.179
the universe.
 

01:05:52.179 --> 01:05:53.949
It's the fourth eclogue.
 

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:58.128
Interestingly,
this also crystallizes that

01:05:58.128 --> 01:06:03.429
which is the fundamental issue
of Virgil's vision.

01:06:03.429 --> 01:06:09.032
The concern with birth,
the concern with the fact of

01:06:09.032 --> 01:06:13.456
being born,
that the fact of being born has

01:06:13.456 --> 01:06:18.018
within itself the potential to
renew the world,

01:06:18.018 --> 01:06:21.559
to effect the world and change
the direction of the world.

01:06:21.559 --> 01:06:23.639
And then we know that he will
say,

01:06:23.639 --> 01:06:26.289
and I will stop here,
because we are coming to the

01:06:26.289 --> 01:06:28.668
end of the period:
"Through thee I was a

01:06:28.668 --> 01:06:31.429
poet,
through thee Christian;

01:06:31.429 --> 01:06:34.168
but that thou mayst see better
what I outline,

01:06:34.168 --> 01:06:36.239
I shall set my hand to color
it.

01:06:36.239 --> 01:06:38.570
Already the world was
everywhere big,"

01:06:38.570 --> 01:06:41.679
pregnant the Italian says,
"with the true faith sown

01:06:41.679 --> 01:06:42.789
by the messengers...
 

01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:44.010
" and so on.
 

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:46.744
He's going to talk how the
world outside,

01:06:46.744 --> 01:06:50.981
only buttressed and reinforced
the message of faith that he had

01:06:50.981 --> 01:06:53.170
found in the fourth eclogue.
 

01:06:53.170 --> 01:06:56.889
The fourth eclogue is seen as a
messianic eclogue,

01:06:56.889 --> 01:07:02.480
but that line that makes the
transition from poetry to faith,

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:04.639
"I was a poet through
thee,

01:07:04.639 --> 01:07:07.623
I was a poet,
through thee a Christian,"

01:07:07.623 --> 01:07:11.355
I think really makes it
necessary for us to linger on it

01:07:11.355 --> 01:07:12.780
for a little bit.
 

01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:16.610
First of all the line has what
we call an anaphora,

01:07:16.610 --> 01:07:20.976
"Through thee I was a
poet, I was a poet through thee

01:07:20.976 --> 01:07:22.510
Christian."
 

01:07:22.510 --> 01:07:27.585
This is the same line that
says, per te,

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:32.550
the Italian word line 73,
per te poeta fui,

01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:35.309
per te cristiano.
 

01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:41.315
The anaphora gives continuity
to the movement of the line from

01:07:41.315 --> 01:07:43.974
poetry to faith,
per te..

01:07:43.974 --> 01:07:45.550
.per te.
 

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:48.190
Nonetheless,
if you read this line carefully

01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:51.260
in Italian you see that there is
also a caesura.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:53.280
You know what I mean by caesura?
 

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.184
Falling in the middle,
a break, per te,

01:07:57.184 --> 01:08:00.050
break, per te cristiano.
 

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:04.215
The lines--gives a--has a
mobility that seems to promise

01:08:04.215 --> 01:08:07.170
the transition from poetry to
faith,

01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:10.971
but at the same time
technically, it forces you to

01:08:10.971 --> 01:08:15.159
stop as if there were two
discontinuous experiences.

01:08:15.159 --> 01:08:18.606
You cannot quite go from one
world of poetry to the one world

01:08:18.606 --> 01:08:19.238
of faith.
 

01:08:19.238 --> 01:08:22.390
You can go from one world of
poetry to one world of faith.

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:26.667
That ambiguity of poetry is
exactly what they are trying to

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:27.479
retrieve.
 

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:33.519
What did I say here today about
this issue of Statius and

01:08:33.519 --> 01:08:34.488
Virgil?
 

01:08:34.488 --> 01:08:39.408
Statius is dealing with the
tragedy of birth.

01:08:39.408 --> 01:08:43.582
Virgil deals with,
optimistically,

01:08:43.582 --> 01:08:50.788
about the history-making
quality of the event of birth.

01:08:50.788 --> 01:08:55.042
That is, at the same time,
a desire to establish a sense

01:08:55.042 --> 01:08:56.899
of what is the sacred?
 

01:08:56.899 --> 01:09:03.578
I will try to discuss with you,
later,

01:09:03.578 --> 01:09:08.899
how poetry is now invested with
the kind of sacredness,

01:09:08.899 --> 01:09:15.324
the ambiguous sense of the word
about the profane and the holy

01:09:15.324 --> 01:09:16.590
within it.
 

01:09:16.590 --> 01:09:20.846
It's a hybrid,
and it's this hybrid that will

01:09:20.846 --> 01:09:25.782
allow Dante to assimilate
Statius' vision to his own

01:09:25.782 --> 01:09:30.038
understanding of history and the
sacred.

01:09:30.038 --> 01:09:33.300
Let me stop here and see if
there are questions.

01:09:41.449 --> 01:09:44.069
Please.
 

01:09:44.069 --> 01:09:47.079
Student:  It seems like
it's more common for Dante to be

01:09:47.079 --> 01:09:49.800
the one to ask the people they
meet for their stories.

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:54.863
Is this the only place that
Virgil is the one who asks the

01:09:54.863 --> 01:09:59.039
questions or what is the
specific event here?

01:09:59.039 --> 01:10:02.590
Prof: Virgil is the--
the question is,

01:10:02.590 --> 01:10:07.435
it seems that usually it's
Dante who interviews the people

01:10:07.435 --> 01:10:11.302
he meets and--
but here in Canto XXI and XXII,

01:10:11.302 --> 01:10:14.038
it's Virgil and is that the
case,

01:10:14.038 --> 01:10:16.310
and if it's true why would that
be the case?

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:20.759
The answer is that that's not
really true because in the canto

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:24.333
of Ulysses, it is he who--it is
Virgil who speaks,

01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:26.448
you remember,
to Ulysses.

01:10:26.448 --> 01:10:28.399
It's Virgil--so it's Virgil and
Ulysses.

01:10:28.399 --> 01:10:32.229
It really has more to do with
the figures of the classical

01:10:32.229 --> 01:10:34.853
world that seem to be,
in this case,

01:10:34.853 --> 01:10:38.773
Virgil seems to be best
indicated for Statius as he was

01:10:38.773 --> 01:10:39.788
for Virgil.
 

01:10:39.788 --> 01:10:44.948
Since you are interested in
this aspect of the dramatization

01:10:44.948 --> 01:10:47.502
of the poem,
I could mention to you for

01:10:47.502 --> 01:10:49.698
instance there are cantos in
Inferno,

01:10:49.698 --> 01:10:53.319
we didn't have a chance to talk
about them where the--

01:10:53.319 --> 01:10:57.590
Virgil would completely
abandon--Dante says,

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:59.500
well you go here,
I don't want to be with you,

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:04.779
you go and on your own carry
out this introduction without--

01:11:04.779 --> 01:11:06.069
I'll wait for you here.
 

01:11:06.069 --> 01:11:08.677
That happens,
for instance,

01:11:08.677 --> 01:11:12.090
in the canto of fraud and
usury.

01:11:12.090 --> 01:11:17.390
It is as if Dante had something
to better understand on his own

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:22.481
without Virgil's presence,
but usually that is the way in

01:11:22.481 --> 01:11:27.010
which the style of the
representation takes place,

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:31.260
who is most apt in the case of
the classical figures,

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.369
the classical poet speaking for
a classical character.

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:48.822
Student:  I wondered if
you could comment a little

01:11:48.822 --> 01:11:53.849
further on the significance in
Canto XIX of what looks like a

01:11:53.849 --> 01:11:58.288
kind of re-enactment of the Fall
of Adam and Eve.

01:11:58.288 --> 01:12:02.399
It's almost as if this woman
even in the--

01:12:02.399 --> 01:12:04.640
Prof: In the dream.
 

01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:06.470
Student:  The
siren--yes, in the dream,

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:11.770
when she brings forth this
promise of happiness,

01:12:11.770 --> 01:12:15.220
it's really echoing the promise
of Lucifer of this,

01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:17.109
I will make you like God.
 

01:12:17.109 --> 01:12:23.740
Why is this sort of--why is
this theme of sort of the Adam

01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:30.605
theme coming up here in XIX and
is there some sort of strand

01:12:30.605 --> 01:12:33.050
that I'm missing?
 

01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:37.742
Prof: The--
well--the question is that it

01:12:37.742 --> 01:12:42.618
says in Canto XIX,
in the dream of the siren,

01:12:42.618 --> 01:12:48.270
there is an echo of the Fall of
Adam more than Lucifer,

01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:50.760
I would say, the Fall of Adam.
 

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:57.046
Why would there be that--if
that's true why would there be

01:12:57.046 --> 01:12:58.369
that echo?
 

01:12:58.369 --> 01:13:01.038
My answer is, I didn't catch it.
 

01:13:01.038 --> 01:13:05.680
I never caught this echo of
Adam there.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:12.319
It's actually the story of the
temptation of this woman fish,

01:13:12.319 --> 01:13:15.420
that's what she is,
right?

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:21.550
The siren who wants to induce
forgetfulness in the pilgrim;

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:23.578
it's really a classical figure.
 

01:13:23.578 --> 01:13:28.793
I would say that--I sort of
resist the--hearing here the

01:13:28.793 --> 01:13:34.863
figure of--in the figure of Adam
because Adam doesn't really talk

01:13:34.863 --> 01:13:36.569
about falling.
 

01:13:36.569 --> 01:13:41.250
This is a danger for the
pilgrim who--

01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:47.368
he's dramatizing his sense of
yielding,

01:13:47.368 --> 01:13:51.159
surrendering his will to the
seduction,

01:13:51.159 --> 01:13:53.270
the seductive song of the siren.
 

01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:56.988
Adam with--this is a story of
love.

01:13:56.988 --> 01:13:59.329
With Adam, the story becomes
one of knowledge;

01:13:59.329 --> 01:14:01.698
it's a little bit different.
 

01:14:01.698 --> 01:14:06.355
There may be echoes,
I'm not going to be so firm and

01:14:06.355 --> 01:14:11.560
say no, there is no echo of that
but I didn't catch it.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:14.399
I didn't feel the necessity for
that, actually,

01:14:14.399 --> 01:14:15.510
for my argument.
 

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:18.158
Student:  Okay,
then maybe I'm answering my own

01:14:18.158 --> 01:14:21.492
question here,
but wouldn't you say that the

01:14:21.492 --> 01:14:26.029
theme of knowledge and
transgression runs through both

01:14:26.029 --> 01:14:30.823
the dream sequence that Dante
has and the story of Adam's

01:14:30.823 --> 01:14:31.680
Fall?
 

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:38.582
I mean, is there that theme
where Ulysses wanted to sort of

01:14:38.582 --> 01:14:43.520
gain this knowledge,
this experience of hearing the

01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:46.930
siren's song,
right and to gain that

01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:51.130
knowledge he had to sort of
transgress.

01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:53.550
Isn't that what the siren
represents?

01:14:53.550 --> 01:14:58.279
You say he keeps coming back to
this theme of Ulysses--

01:14:58.279 --> 01:14:59.270
Prof: He does.
 

01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:00.970
He mentions the story of
Ulysses.

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:02.908
He does mention the story of
Ulysses.

01:15:02.908 --> 01:15:04.390
Student:  Is that where
the Adam connection really comes

01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.510
in?
 

01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:07.600
Because Adam's--ultimately ate
the fruit for knowledge.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:11.947
Prof: Yeah,
well I indicated that the story

01:15:11.947 --> 01:15:16.204
of Adam in Canto XXVI
retrospectively illuminates

01:15:16.204 --> 01:15:21.439
what's happening in Canto XXVI
of Inferno and that he

01:15:21.439 --> 01:15:25.881
too experienced--
understands knowledge and

01:15:25.881 --> 01:15:29.185
transgression,
that they go hand in hand,

01:15:29.185 --> 01:15:32.587
and that it's difficult--
impossible to separate them and

01:15:32.587 --> 01:15:34.118
that's the story of Ulysses.
 

01:15:34.118 --> 01:15:40.135
Dante does feel that he's--but
it's a dangerous temptation for

01:15:40.135 --> 01:15:44.078
him to believe that he's like
Ulysses.

01:15:44.078 --> 01:15:47.850
Whereas, he has no problem
later in--when he understands

01:15:47.850 --> 01:15:50.457
what the story of Adam is,
in thinking,

01:15:50.457 --> 01:15:53.750
in acknowledging that Adam is
the arch poet.

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:57.939
We are all reinventing the
world, etc.

01:15:57.939 --> 01:16:01.551
So I would say that there are
three figures here:

01:16:01.551 --> 01:16:04.336
Ulysses,
Adam, and Dante and--but the

01:16:04.336 --> 01:16:07.479
relation between them is never
what one of--

01:16:07.479 --> 01:16:10.460
full of identification on the
part of Dante with either--

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:16.643
he comes here approximates them
and somehow also pulls away from

01:16:16.643 --> 01:16:17.329
both.
 

01:16:17.329 --> 01:16:18.800
He's not really Adam.
 

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:22.381
He's not the arch poet who
names the world,

01:16:22.381 --> 01:16:24.939
and he's not really Ulysses.
 

01:16:24.939 --> 01:16:29.701
That fear that he may be like
Ulysses, which is a more

01:16:29.701 --> 01:16:34.912
dangerous sense that he has,
that will continue more openly

01:16:34.912 --> 01:16:36.529
as he goes on.
 

01:16:36.529 --> 01:16:40.572
The story of Adam is going to
be picked up in the Garden of

01:16:40.572 --> 01:16:41.060
Eden.
 

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:44.395
The Garden of Eden,
of course, that is the idea

01:16:44.395 --> 01:16:48.604
that we lost a garden but Dante
does not want to be in that

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:49.908
garden anyway.
 

01:16:49.908 --> 01:16:54.918
When he comes to the Garden of
Eden, he identifies it with a

01:16:54.918 --> 01:16:58.145
lot of things,
really nostalgia for the

01:16:58.145 --> 01:16:59.078
mother.
 

01:16:59.078 --> 01:17:02.840
He doesn't--he understands that
he has to grow up;

01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.810
he has to get out of that
fantasy.

01:17:04.810 --> 01:17:11.703
I don't know if this is--
Student:  What confuses

01:17:11.703 --> 01:17:16.770
me I guess is that the siren
here in the dream sequence seems

01:17:16.770 --> 01:17:20.149
to be wanting to halt Dante's
quest,

01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:21.039
his journey forward for
knowledge.

01:17:21.039 --> 01:17:22.310
Prof: Yes, absolutely.
 

01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:25.939
Student:  Yet,
with respect to Ulysses,

01:17:25.939 --> 01:17:28.970
the siren seemed to represent
the opposite,

01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:33.373
in the sense that his
interaction with her was

01:17:33.373 --> 01:17:39.051
something where he was trying to
go past the bounds to gain

01:17:39.051 --> 01:17:43.750
knowledge or gain experience of
hearing her.

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:47.400
I'm trying to draw the
connections in my mind for what

01:17:47.400 --> 01:17:51.189
is really Dante trying to tell
us with this sequence?

01:17:51.189 --> 01:18:01.090
Why does he go back to this
reference to the siren?

01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:02.729
I mean maybe you could just
summarize;

01:18:02.729 --> 01:18:06.862
I guess maybe it would just
help clear it up what she

01:18:06.862 --> 01:18:10.993
represents to Dante here in
Canto XIX versus what she

01:18:10.993 --> 01:18:13.060
represents to Ulysses?
 

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:16.078
Prof: Good,
what does the siren represent?

01:18:16.078 --> 01:18:18.952
Very briefly,
what does the siren represent

01:18:18.952 --> 01:18:20.729
to Dante and to Ulysses?
 

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:21.618
What is the difference?
 

01:18:21.618 --> 01:18:26.479
To Dante, the siren represents
the lure of death.

01:18:26.479 --> 01:18:30.641
He understands that beneath
that promises of yield to the

01:18:30.641 --> 01:18:34.210
here and now and to my voice
there is really--

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:38.810
there's a nothingness and he's
attracted to that nothingness.

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:40.689
That's really what it is.
 

01:18:40.689 --> 01:18:43.265
For Ulysses,
she also represents the

01:18:43.265 --> 01:18:47.609
extraordinary enchantment of the
song that would lead him to

01:18:47.609 --> 01:18:51.730
death because that's what
happens to all those who listen

01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:53.130
to the siren.
 

01:18:53.130 --> 01:18:57.578
Ulysses wants to hear it and
bind himself so that does not

01:18:57.578 --> 01:19:00.000
yield altogether to her call.
 

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.039
That's how I can put it.
 

01:19:02.039 --> 01:19:03.350
Thank you. We'll see you.

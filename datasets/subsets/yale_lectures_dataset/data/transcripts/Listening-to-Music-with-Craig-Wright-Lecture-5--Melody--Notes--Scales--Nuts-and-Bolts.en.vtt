00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:03.430
Prof: Good morning,
let us begin.

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.334
Today we're going to move away
from the first dimension of

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:09.800
music that we've been looking
at,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.911
which is duration,
or time, and begin to work with

00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:15.390
the second,
which is pitch, and melody.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.090
And here's an initial question
for you.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.522
Think of the texture of music
and think of these strands of

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:23.410
high and low.
 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.700
Where does melody sit in the
texture?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.560
Is it high, middle or low?
 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.660
Where is it?
 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.170
If you think about it
conceptually,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.480
try to figure out,
well, I got this board up here,

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.812
this tapestry,
or whatever,

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.067
where's my melody going to be
in the texture:

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:41.570
high,
middle or low?

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.310
Michael?
 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.850
Student:  It would be
high.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.210
Prof: Yeah, usually high.
 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.068
Now, here's an interesting
question for you,

00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:48.730
why is it usually high?
 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.720
There's an acoustical reason
for this.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.520
Why does the melody show up in
the high range?

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.860
Student:
&gt;

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.470
Prof: I beg your pardon?
 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.700
Student:  It's easier to
hear.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.609
Prof: It's easier to
hear in a high range.

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.490
Why is it easier to hear in a
high range?

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.370
What about the acoustics here?
 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.159
Once again, the laws of
acoustics.

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.090
Why is it easier to hear in a
high range?

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.161
I could play for you,
for example,

00:01:12.161 --> 00:01:13.730
a little bit of Mozart.
 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.709
It would sound like this.
 

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:21.430
&gt;
 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.140
You like that?
 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.709
&gt;
 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:32.129
Sounds better up there,
doesn't it?

00:01:32.129 --> 00:01:33.090
Why is that the case?
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.690
Yeah.
 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.512
Student:  Maybe you can
put the frequency of the higher

00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:39.010
pitches as high so you can
detect the sound quicker and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.400
&gt;.
 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.700
Prof: That's it exactly.
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.714
In a melody,
we tend to have a lot of

00:01:43.714 --> 00:01:45.170
rhythmic activity there.
 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.650
It's got to have activity to
play itself out as melody.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:55.766
But because the way sound waves
operate, we have these low sound

00:01:55.766 --> 00:02:01.049
waves taking a very long time to
clear.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.250
The higher frequencies take a
lot shorter time to clear.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.890
They're short sound waves.
 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.218
They clear very quickly.
 

00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:12.877
So, we can hear a melody--we
can hear a melody more clearly

00:02:12.877 --> 00:02:16.169
in this higher register and
therefore,

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:19.938
there is always the tendency to
have the bass play long,

00:02:19.938 --> 00:02:24.324
low notes because those sounds
take a long time to clear and

00:02:24.324 --> 00:02:28.187
melodies play faster notes
because those sounds clear

00:02:28.187 --> 00:02:31.830
quickly and we can hear and
enjoy the melody.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.753
All right, that's just an
opening thought about why

00:02:34.753 --> 00:02:37.680
melodies show up in the top part
of the texture.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.008
Let's talk about melody here
and let's talk about pitch.

00:02:40.008 --> 00:02:46.520
We said before that in Western
music we have musical notation.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.010
And musical notation is relied
on more in Western music than

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.970
any other musical civilization
around the world.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.596
And in the West,
this whole idea of pitch

00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:58.419
notation goes back to the ninth
century,

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.318
when the monks and nuns in
Benedictine abbeys in

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:06.632
Switzerland and France and
Germany and northern Italy

00:03:06.632 --> 00:03:10.425
started doing this;
they started marking on

00:03:10.425 --> 00:03:14.610
parchment or slate the general
course of a melody.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.476
Eventually, what they did was
to separate these lines into

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:25.520
more discreet places,
or more discreet pitches.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.663
Then around one thousand in
northern Italy,

00:03:27.663 --> 00:03:30.622
an enterprising fellow named
Guido of Arezzo came along and

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:32.460
said, "Well,
you know what?

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.919
I can get this to show us how
far up we are supposed to go,

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.114
by placing it on some kind of
grid here,"

00:03:42.114 --> 00:03:44.262
and this is this--
as I said before,

00:03:44.262 --> 00:03:47.918
the beginning of the first
graph in the history of the

00:03:47.918 --> 00:03:48.470
West.
 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.461
This grid of horizontal lines
(and we will know that if we're

00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:55.920
going from here to here),
it's got to be exactly this

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.449
frequency, or at least this
space.

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.899
So, initially they came up with
four lines and then eventually

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.669
five and even six,
and then they went back to five

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.310
by the fifteenth century.
 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.051
What they also did around the
year one thousand was to

00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:15.794
identify--to label--these
particular spots--spaces and

00:04:15.794 --> 00:04:16.689
lines.
 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:21.658
So they began to call this A
and this B and this C and this D

00:04:21.658 --> 00:04:24.060
and this E, this F,
this G.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.759
When they got up here,
they stopped.

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.620
Why did they stop?
 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.055
Why didn't they keep right on
going with G,

00:04:34.055 --> 00:04:35.680
H, I, J, K, L,
M, N, O, P?

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.519
Why don't we sing Ms and Os and
Ps today?

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:40.250
Why did they stop?
 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.480
Any ideas?
 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.620
&gt;
 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.180
Roger?
 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.440
Student: 
&gt;

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.735
Prof: Yeah,
they had this thing--they hit

00:04:48.735 --> 00:04:50.250
this thing called the octave.
 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.810
And, of course,
there's this--another

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.067
acoustical phenomenon here we've
talked about before,

00:04:54.067 --> 00:04:56.019
what's the relationship within
an octave?

00:04:56.019 --> 00:04:59.374
The string is vibrating higher
when it's exactly twice what the

00:04:59.374 --> 00:05:00.240
lower one is .
 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.742
So, they heard this and they
heard this as essentially all

00:05:03.742 --> 00:05:04.480
one sound.
 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.956
So, if it's a duplication of
sound, let's duplicate the

00:05:07.956 --> 00:05:08.600
letters.
 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.125
But you can look at manuscripts
of the early eleventh century

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:15.711
and see people singing Ps and Ls
and Os and Ms and things like

00:05:15.711 --> 00:05:16.240
that.
 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.526
But eventually,
they began to uniformly adopt

00:05:18.526 --> 00:05:21.750
this system of what's called
"octave duplication."

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.930
And every musical culture
around the world--

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.826
and I've talked with
ethnomusicologists about this

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.132
particular point--
every musical culture around

00:05:29.132 --> 00:05:31.339
the world,
Chinese, Japanese,

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.254
Indonesian, Indian,
African whatever,

00:05:34.254 --> 00:05:38.029
they all use this phenomenon of
octave duplication in their

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:40.829
music--
octave duplication in the music.

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:44.742
But how they divide up this
sonic space within the octave

00:05:44.742 --> 00:05:46.910
can vary rather considerably.
 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.487
Some Arabic music seems to have
as many as fourteen gradations

00:05:50.487 --> 00:05:51.660
within the octave.
 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.730
Now, we're going to listen to a
piece of music here from the

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.077
tradition of classical India and
I thought we might have a sitar

00:06:00.077 --> 00:06:01.389
player in here.
 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.399
Somebody--I got wind of the
fact we might have a classical

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:07.396
Indian musician in our class,
somebody that had studied the

00:06:07.396 --> 00:06:09.920
sitar and might be able to come
in and play one for us.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.733
But we don't have that,
so we're going to use something

00:06:13.733 --> 00:06:17.689
on our CDs by the world famous
sitarist, Ravi Shankar.

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:19.250
Okay, you've probably heard of
him.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.569
He's actually quite old now.
 

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:21.769
He must be--surely he's in his
eighties.

00:06:21.769 --> 00:06:25.221
He was very famous when I was
in graduate school tons and tons

00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:26.069
of years ago.
 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:29.620
So--but he is the
venerable sitar player.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.540
And here is the pattern,
the raga.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:34.810
We'll call it a scale.
 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.579
It's not really a scale but a
raga that he is using.

00:06:37.579 --> 00:06:39.480
It's got only six notes within
the octave.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.329
&gt;
 

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:53.550
Prof: And the six notes
are--&gt;

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.110
--that particular pattern.
 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.759
Doesn't sound like any scale
we've ever heard of.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.973
So, let's listen to Ravi
Shankar play a bit of a raga

00:07:01.973 --> 00:07:04.000
using a six-note scale.
 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:28.610
&gt;
 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.994
Okay, so that gives you a
flavor of that and you have

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:36.197
that, of course,
on your CD number six,

00:07:36.197 --> 00:07:37.209
fifteen.
 

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:41.129
So that's a bit of sitar music.
 

00:07:41.129 --> 00:07:44.149
Now, we're going to play
another six-note scale.

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:46.860
Let's go onto that one when
Lynda gets set.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.440
And this, of course,
is sung by Nora Jones.

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.088
And, as you know from reading
the textbook,

00:07:53.088 --> 00:07:54.980
why do I mention Nora Jones?
 

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.980
Or why do we play Nora Jones
right after Ravi Shankar?

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.857
Student:  It's his
daughter..

00:07:58.857 --> 00:07:59.709
Prof: It's his
daughter.

00:07:59.709 --> 00:08:01.740
Isn't that interesting?
 

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:04.855
Every Saturday morning I'm
going through Stop 'N Shop and

00:08:04.855 --> 00:08:07.470
there's Nora Jones in the
background playing.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.589
I'm going down the pasta aisle
or whatever, and I have the

00:08:10.589 --> 00:08:13.000
daughter of Ravi Shankar over my
shoulder.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.730
What a world, huh?
 

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:19.675
So, we're going to listen to
just a couple of seconds here of

00:08:19.675 --> 00:08:22.480
a blues tune sung by Nora Jones.
 

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:47.308
&gt;
 

00:08:47.308 --> 00:08:49.100
Okay, so we'll just cut off
here.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.761
But what she's working off of
here--we're not going to listen

00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:54.070
to the whole thing--is this idea
of a blues scale.

00:08:54.070 --> 00:09:09.500
&gt;
 

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.950
And so on. How's that operate?
 

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:16.840
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.018
With this one,
sometimes major and sometimes

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:20.610
minor.
 

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.320
We'll come back to that part.
 

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.503
So, that's another six-note
scale but a different sort of

00:09:24.503 --> 00:09:26.720
pattern, a different kind of
pattern.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.788
It's a blues scale pattern.
 

00:09:27.788 --> 00:09:30.322
It's kind of between the major
and minor that we'll talk about

00:09:30.322 --> 00:09:31.320
a little bit later on.
 

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.951
So, two different forms of a
six-note pattern,

00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:35.940
let's go to a five-note
pattern.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.960
If you've ever visited parts of
Indonesia--

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.830
which I have not--and if you've
ever visited parts of China--

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:46.029
which I have not--I am told
that you will hear this kind of

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:46.610
music.
 

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.394
It's played by a traditional
Chinese instrument called the

00:09:50.394 --> 00:09:50.860
erhu.
 

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.879
This I have seen around the
world many times and heard.

00:09:53.879 --> 00:09:58.139
It's a two-stringed instrument
that produces a particularly

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:00.048
beautiful, vibrant tone.
 

00:10:00.048 --> 00:10:02.658
So, we're going to listen to an
erhu playing.

00:10:02.658 --> 00:10:06.294
I think this is track--if you
want to pursue it,

00:10:06.294 --> 00:10:09.080
it's track--six-CD--track
sixteen.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.210
Let's listen to an erhu play a
melody by a traditional Chinese

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.609
composer--
we call him in English

00:10:16.609 --> 00:10:19.388
"Abbing"
and you can read about him

00:10:19.388 --> 00:10:21.029
there in your textbook.
 

00:10:21.029 --> 00:10:48.730
&gt;
 

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:51.769
Okay, so let's see--let's pick
that up.

00:10:51.769 --> 00:11:07.470
&gt;
 

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.570
Five notes within the octave
just there.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:12.700
So, it's a penta--what we call
a pentatonic scale.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.923
And that's used in a lot of Far
East cultures--the pentatonic

00:11:16.923 --> 00:11:19.600
scale, just a five-note scale
there.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.950
Okay, so we have--there's a
whole idea of octave

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:24.798
duplication--sometimes six
notes, sometimes five notes.

00:11:24.798 --> 00:11:28.039
We in the west have settled on
a seven-note scale.

00:11:28.039 --> 00:11:29.149
Why did that happen?
 

00:11:29.149 --> 00:11:32.883
Well, we have this idea of a
seven-note major and seven-note

00:11:32.883 --> 00:11:33.389
minor.
 

00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:35.139
Why seven notes?
 

00:11:35.139 --> 00:11:37.770
Well, for the answer to that we
have to go back to ancient Greek

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.553
music theory,
and when you read about

00:11:39.553 --> 00:11:41.998
this--it's really turgid stuff--
but believe it or not,

00:11:41.998 --> 00:11:43.850
I teach a course on this at the
graduate level.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:46.697
We have to read--poor Lynda has
to take this kind of

00:11:46.697 --> 00:11:49.490
stuff--reading Aristoxenus and
things like this.

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:52.626
So, what we're dealing here
with is a situation where the

00:11:52.626 --> 00:11:55.821
ancient Greeks were very much
into mathematics as a way of

00:11:55.821 --> 00:11:59.240
explaining the world and
explaining music in particular .

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.269
And they thought these ratios
were primary.

00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:03.019
So, they had the ratio of two
to one,

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:04.610
which gave them the octave,
and three to two,

00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:06.070
which gave them the fifth,
and four to three,

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:07.038
which gave them the fourth.
 

00:12:07.038 --> 00:12:10.134
They also, because the system
worked out better for their

00:12:10.134 --> 00:12:13.672
purposes, then jumped to nine to
eight, which gave them the whole

00:12:13.672 --> 00:12:14.168
tone.
 

00:12:14.168 --> 00:12:17.566
So, they started out there and
let's say they were working down

00:12:17.566 --> 00:12:17.950
here.
 

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.429
They filled in the octave up
above and then they filled in

00:12:20.429 --> 00:12:23.126
the fifth and then they filled
in the fourth and then they came

00:12:23.126 --> 00:12:25.869
down a whole step and then they
went up a fourth from that whole

00:12:25.869 --> 00:12:27.740
step and then up a fourth from
that,

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.120
and they were filling in in
this fashion.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.086
Interestingly enough--and you
ever wonder this?--sometimes

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.274
somebody will wander by a
keyboard and say,

00:12:35.274 --> 00:12:36.678
"That's odd."
 

00:12:36.678 --> 00:12:39.668
What's the great oddity about
the keyboard?

00:12:39.668 --> 00:12:41.909
What's strange about this
keyboard?

00:12:41.909 --> 00:12:45.710
It's very asymmetrical, right?
 

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.379
Marcus?
 

00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:48.379
Student:  It's missing
&gt;.

00:12:48.379 --> 00:12:50.932
Prof: Yeah,
it's missing some notes in

00:12:50.932 --> 00:12:51.340
here.
 

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.700
It's missing something in here,
and it's missing--well what

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:54.840
these are were the cracks.
 

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:58.149
After the Greeks laid out their
fifths and fourths and whole

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:00.450
steps, they had these little
leftovers.

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.970
They called them leimmas.
 

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:05.961
They had these little leftovers
in there and that's why we end

00:13:05.961 --> 00:13:08.841
up with these small distances
between B and C

00:13:08.841 --> 00:13:10.610
&gt;
 

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:11.590
That's a big step.
 

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.419
&gt;
 

00:13:13.419 --> 00:13:15.110
That's a small step there.
 

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.649
So, the scale is actually not
equal.

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:20.460
A to B is one distance,
which is a large one,

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.538
and B to C is only half that
distance,

00:13:22.538 --> 00:13:25.379
and that's because of the way
the Greeks laid this thing out

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:28.620
with their two to one ratios,
three to two ratios and so on.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.620
But in any event,
we end up with this.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:33.928
Now, the Greeks had a whole
series of patterns.

00:13:33.928 --> 00:13:37.018
They called them mixolydian,
and hypomixolydian and phrygian

00:13:37.018 --> 00:13:39.059
and hypophrygian and stuff like
this.

00:13:39.059 --> 00:13:40.480
A lot of different patterns.
 

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.412
But in the course of history,
we settled beginning in the

00:13:43.412 --> 00:13:45.350
sixteenth and seventeenth
century,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:49.841
down into just two patterns:
what we call the major pattern

00:13:49.841 --> 00:13:51.700
and the minor pattern.
 

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.308
So, let's talk about that just
for a moment.

00:13:55.308 --> 00:13:57.833
And before we do it,
I should add one other thing:

00:13:57.833 --> 00:14:00.202
how, then, do we get these
other notes up here,

00:14:00.202 --> 00:14:02.110
we get these other notes up
here?

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.210
Well, what we now call the
black notes--

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:07.769
although historically keyboards
could be either way--

00:14:07.769 --> 00:14:11.285
you could have these added
notes black or white and then

00:14:11.285 --> 00:14:13.460
these underneath would be black.
 

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.509
So we filled these out.
 

00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:18.548
In the fourteenth century,
all of this got filled in.

00:14:18.548 --> 00:14:21.835
These between B and C and E and
F didn't get filled in because

00:14:21.835 --> 00:14:24.960
they were already just the
smallest amount that they wanted

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.889
to deal with,
just half steps.

00:14:26.889 --> 00:14:28.690
So, we end up here within an
octave--

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:32.178
we end up with twelve equal
pitches,

00:14:32.178 --> 00:14:35.940
but we still use this term a
'seven-note scale' because we

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:39.568
have seven notes within the
scale of the major scale and

00:14:39.568 --> 00:14:43.000
seven notes within the scale of
the minor scale.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.980
All right, so let's talk about
major and minor now.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:48.558
And we've put those patterns up
here.

00:14:48.558 --> 00:14:51.120
This is given for you in your
textbook.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.580
This is something of a review.
 

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.408
Let's start with a major scale
on a C.

00:14:55.408 --> 00:14:59.821
So, here is the symbol for C
and the staff here is where C

00:14:59.821 --> 00:15:02.528
would be located on the
keyboard.

00:15:02.528 --> 00:15:05.724
We're going to start here and
we have this pattern of the

00:15:05.724 --> 00:15:07.663
major that goes whole,
whole, half,

00:15:07.663 --> 00:15:09.658
whole, whole,
whole, half step.

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:13.639
So, we start on C and then we
go up to D--a whole step.

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:15.269
I'm going to write that in here.
 

00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:18.970
That's good,
then we go D up to E;

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.740
that's another whole step.
 

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:22.259
Now, I have a half step.
 

00:15:22.259 --> 00:15:24.210
I got to go up just a half step
there, I'm on E.

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:26.278
But it's just--F is just a half
step away, so that's good.

00:15:26.278 --> 00:15:28.389
I don't need to do anything
more than that.

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:30.070
Now, I'm on F here.
 

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.240
Well, I need a whole step.
 

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:31.889
There's my one.
 

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:32.700
I need a whole step.
 

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:37.030
I got to go up to G and then
another whole step up to A and

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:39.570
then another whole step up to B.
 

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:46.533
And the last one in the major
pattern is a half step from B to

00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:46.990
C.
 

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:50.299
There we are, and that's good.
 

00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:52.840
So, we've got our major scale.
 

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.940
Let's talk a little bit about
the minor scale.

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:57.240
Now, it's got a different
pattern.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:58.460
It's got a different pattern.
 

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.509
They like melodies to go
this way.

00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:02.070
They like melodies to go
this way.

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:05.190
Let's start on the same pitch,
C.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.659
Let's go up a whole step.
 

00:16:07.659 --> 00:16:09.690
What's a whole step above C?
 

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.850
Up--just D.
 

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.692
Now, we need,
according to our pattern,

00:16:13.692 --> 00:16:15.049
to go up just a half step.
 

00:16:15.049 --> 00:16:17.850
What's a half step above D?
 

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.940
Well, then we have to think
about it.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.264
We've got to get into these
black notes, which can be called

00:16:23.264 --> 00:16:24.278
sharps or flats.
 

00:16:24.278 --> 00:16:27.679
They're called sharps if
they're up above the note in

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:28.399
question.
 

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:30.418
This would be some kind of D
sharp.

00:16:30.418 --> 00:16:33.600
They're called flats if they're
down below.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.549
So, flats are below,
sharps take you up a half step.

00:16:37.549 --> 00:16:40.190
So, we went C to D.
 

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.480
We need this pitch, here.
 

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.610
What are we going to call it?
 

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.288
Student: 
&gt;

00:16:45.288 --> 00:16:48.092
Prof: Or,
we are going to call it D

00:16:48.092 --> 00:16:48.639
sharp?
 

00:16:48.639 --> 00:16:51.340
Well, we should call it E- flat.
 

00:16:51.340 --> 00:16:54.577
We should call it E-flat and
put it up on the E line because

00:16:54.577 --> 00:16:57.870
there's kind of rule here that
you have to use up each letter

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.870
name in turn,
each letter name in turn.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.428
We can't go C, D, D-sharp, F.
 

00:17:02.428 --> 00:17:04.864
We got to go C,
D, some kind of E,

00:17:04.864 --> 00:17:05.160
F.
 

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.390
So, you've got to go up the
alphabet here.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:11.278
All right, so there we are,
but is this,

00:17:11.278 --> 00:17:13.970
from D to E,
a half step?

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.558
We need a half step here.
 

00:17:15.558 --> 00:17:19.199
What we've written is a whole
step, so we've got to indicate

00:17:19.199 --> 00:17:22.282
that this is just a half step
away in that fashion,

00:17:22.282 --> 00:17:23.269
D to E-flat.
 

00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:25.970
Now, what do we do above E flat?
 

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:28.816
Well, a whole step
here--there's one half,

00:17:28.816 --> 00:17:31.594
there's another half,
would take us to F,

00:17:31.594 --> 00:17:34.579
whole step above F,
would take us to G.

00:17:34.579 --> 00:17:36.250
What am I going to write here?
 

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:38.880
From G I need a half step.
 

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.119
Here is--it doesn't--here's the
pattern up here.

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:45.180
We'll focus on this one.
 

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.940
I need a half step above G.
 

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.650
What's a half step above G?
 

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:49.200
Student: 
&gt;

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:49.828
Prof: A-flat.
 

00:17:49.828 --> 00:17:56.170
Okay, I need,
now, a whole step above A-flat.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.970
Hmm, nice and loud please,
Edward?

00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:59.430
Student: 
&gt;

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.298
Prof: B-flat, okay.
 

00:18:01.298 --> 00:18:05.496
And then at the end of the
process I have another whole

00:18:05.496 --> 00:18:09.692
step from B-flat back to C,
and that gets me back to my

00:18:09.692 --> 00:18:11.788
octave in that fashion.
 

00:18:11.788 --> 00:18:14.259
Okay, well, I think that's
straightforward enough.

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:18.115
If you're unsure about that,
check out, of course,

00:18:18.115 --> 00:18:22.208
chapter three in the textbook,
where these issues are

00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:23.309
addressed.
 

00:18:23.309 --> 00:18:31.430
 
 

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:35.116
Okay, we've been talking about
scales, these ideas of major and

00:18:35.116 --> 00:18:36.009
minor scales.
 

00:18:36.009 --> 00:18:40.156
We said there are seven notes
in each of these two scales,

00:18:40.156 --> 00:18:43.650
twelve pitches all together
within the octave.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:46.558
But within the scale,
all notes are not the same.

00:18:46.558 --> 00:18:48.285
There's one note that's the
primary note,

00:18:48.285 --> 00:18:48.630
right?
 

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:52.170
What's the primary note called,
the note around which all of

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.509
the others--all the others
gravitate?

00:18:54.509 --> 00:18:55.630
Student: 
&gt;

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.500
Prof: Tonic note, okay?
 

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.955
Then there's one other that we
have to know about,

00:19:00.955 --> 00:19:02.509
it's called the leading tone.
 

00:19:02.509 --> 00:19:06.900
And what it does is pull into
the tonic.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.660
Let's say we're in the key of C
here.

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:11.640
The leading tone is always the
seventh degree.

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:15.320
It's always a half step--always
a half step--seventh degree,

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.630
right below,
right below the tonic.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:18.577
You might say,
"Wait a minute,

00:19:18.577 --> 00:19:19.750
I thought the tonic was down
here."

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.231
Well, you got one,
two, three, four,

00:19:21.231 --> 00:19:22.460
five, six, seven and eight.
 

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.509
Eight is a duplication of one.
 

00:19:24.509 --> 00:19:25.940
Eight and one are the tonic.
 

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.390
So, seven pulls up into eight.
 

00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:31.650
It pulls up into eight--the
tonic.

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:46.220
&lt;&lt;plays piano and
sings&gt;&gt;

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:47.930
That's the leading tone.
 

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.160
Where's it want to go?
 

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.529
Student: 
&gt;

00:19:50.529 --> 00:19:53.490
&lt;&lt;sings while playing
piano&gt;&gt;

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.029
Prof: You can hear it
pulling in there.

00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:56.670
Opera singers love this.
 

00:19:56.670 --> 00:20:00.566
They love to kind of luxuriate
in the opportunity to show off

00:20:00.566 --> 00:20:03.756
their voice on a leading tone,
build up expectation,

00:20:03.756 --> 00:20:05.750
make you wait even more for
that tonic.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:11.150
Let's listen to Luciano
Pavarotti sing a leading tone,

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:14.151
and as by coincidence,
it happens to be the one-year

00:20:14.151 --> 00:20:16.798
anniversary of Pavarotti's death
this week.

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:19.108
So, here's Luciano Pavarotti
singing a leading tone.

00:20:19.108 --> 00:20:22.285
The tempo here is very slow and
he slows it down even more and

00:20:22.285 --> 00:20:25.406
then it just sits out there,
this huge wonderful voice that

00:20:25.406 --> 00:20:27.200
he had,
on the leading tone.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:41.450
&lt;&lt;Pavarotti
singing&gt;&gt;

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:44.577
Prof: Okay,
and you can hear him sort of--

00:20:44.577 --> 00:20:46.990
he didn't
go--&gt;

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:50.578
He went-- &gt;
 

00:20:50.578 --> 00:20:56.327
You could hear him slide that
leading tone up into the tonic

00:20:56.327 --> 00:20:57.788
in that case.
 

00:20:57.788 --> 00:21:04.196
Okay, so we've got across the
idea of tonics and leading

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:05.130
tones.
 

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.079
Did we do tonics?
 

00:21:06.079 --> 00:21:07.180
Do we know what a tonic is?
 

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.369
&gt;
 

00:21:10.369 --> 00:21:11.420
Sing it.
 

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.740
&gt;
 

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:16.689
So, given the set-up,
you kind of feel what you're

00:21:16.689 --> 00:21:20.395
missing, you know,
what this home pitch is--the

00:21:20.395 --> 00:21:23.538
pitch to which you are
gravitating.

00:21:23.538 --> 00:21:28.077
Most of our popular music,
folk songs and things like

00:21:28.077 --> 00:21:32.788
that, are written in duple meter
and in a major key.

00:21:32.788 --> 00:21:36.324
Occasionally,
you get things written in

00:21:36.324 --> 00:21:40.509
triple meter and in a minor
key--minor key.

00:21:40.509 --> 00:22:02.858
&gt;
 

00:22:02.858 --> 00:22:05.372
That's Gershwin:
Porgy and Bess,

00:22:05.372 --> 00:22:06.098
in minor.
 

00:22:06.098 --> 00:22:19.349
Folk song--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:22:19.349 --> 00:22:20.670
Old Civil War song.
 

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:23.250
And so on it goes.
 

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:25.518
Occasionally,
you do run into pop pieces,

00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:28.013
folk songs, in minor,
but most of them are in

00:22:28.013 --> 00:22:30.848
major--probably about eighty
percent in major.

00:22:30.848 --> 00:22:32.818
Same thing in the classical
realm.

00:22:32.818 --> 00:22:36.253
Lynda, what would you say,
what percentage of classical

00:22:36.253 --> 00:22:38.480
pieces are written in minor
keys?

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:40.009
Student:  Very small.
 

00:22:40.009 --> 00:22:43.631
Prof: Well,
give us a number,

00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:46.180
take a--
Student:  Five percent.

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.380
Prof: Only five?
 

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:47.980
Student:  It's classical?
 

00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.041
Prof: Classical,
maybe a little more than that,

00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:52.430
but not all that many.
 

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.710
Here's-- Student:
 &gt;

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.940
Prof: I don't know,
we should do a survey sometime.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.305
Go through the literature,
see what--but mostly,

00:22:58.305 --> 00:23:00.470
for the most part,
it shows minor--major.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:02.190
Occasionally, minor is chosen.
 

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.009
Here's a good example of a
minor from the second movement

00:23:05.009 --> 00:23:06.619
of Beethoven's Third Symphony.
 

00:23:06.619 --> 00:23:35.180
&gt;.
 

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:41.376
But from Mozart,
major--difference between major

00:23:41.376 --> 00:23:42.960
and minor.
 

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:48.509
&gt;
 

00:23:48.509 --> 00:23:50.140
Lovely major.
 

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:57.529
&gt;
 

00:23:57.529 --> 00:24:00.407
So, we're used to making
associations with major and

00:24:00.407 --> 00:24:00.858
minor.
 

00:24:00.858 --> 00:24:03.205
Major: happy,
bright, optimistic,

00:24:03.205 --> 00:24:04.599
a day like today.
 

00:24:04.599 --> 00:24:06.069
Minor: somber.
 

00:24:06.069 --> 00:24:07.829
&gt;
 

00:24:07.829 --> 00:24:09.210
Why is that the case?
 

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:11.269
Is there anything in the
physics of this music?

00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:12.660
No, not really.
 

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:15.784
There's nothing in the laws of
acoustics here that cause that

00:24:15.784 --> 00:24:16.670
to be the case.
 

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.570
If you look back over it,
there was no major or minor in

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.210
western music up until about
sixteenth century,

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.569
and then people started writing
these things called madrigals,

00:24:24.569 --> 00:24:25.608
that were tied to texts.
 

00:24:25.608 --> 00:24:28.548
And they got in this habit of,
every time they had a bright,

00:24:28.548 --> 00:24:33.088
happy text, they'd set this in
one kind of mode or key--

00:24:33.088 --> 00:24:35.730
a major mode--and every time
they had a sad one,

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:36.858
they'd set it in minor.
 

00:24:36.858 --> 00:24:38.318
We got used to hearing it that
way,

00:24:38.318 --> 00:24:40.160
so it's kind of--every time,
you know,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.890
Schumann wants to write about
the merry farmer--

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.490
&gt;
 

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:49.452
But every time Chopin wants to
write a funeral

00:24:49.452 --> 00:24:52.710
march--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;.

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:55.084
And there's a tendency
also--minor: low,

00:24:55.084 --> 00:24:56.789
major: high kind of thing.
 

00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:57.910
So, we get used to this.
 

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.930
And this point-- that it is
culture rather than acoustics--

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.508
was brought home to me once in
a discussion with a student here

00:25:03.508 --> 00:25:05.708
at Yale who said to me,
"Yeah, but over there at

00:25:05.708 --> 00:25:08.836
the Slifka Center,
we Jews have lots of happy

00:25:08.836 --> 00:25:12.190
melodies and they are all in
minor--

00:25:12.190 --> 00:25:13.808
what you would call minor."
 

00:25:13.808 --> 00:25:15.596
And so I thought about that,
"Yeah, that's probably

00:25:15.596 --> 00:25:16.019
true."
 

00:25:16.019 --> 00:25:23.038
Even the-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:25:23.038 --> 00:25:24.910
Isn't that the Israeli national
anthem?

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.759
I think so.
 

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:28.289
Is that right? What is that?
 

00:25:28.289 --> 00:25:29.920
What? Yes or no?
 

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.558
Student:  Yes.
 

00:25:30.558 --> 00:25:32.673
Prof: Okay,
but it may be--how many

00:25:32.673 --> 00:25:35.818
national anthems around the
world do we have in minor keys?

00:25:35.818 --> 00:25:38.700
And what does this say about
the tradition of Jewish music?

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.894
Is it really Western or is it
Eastern European or even with

00:25:42.894 --> 00:25:44.630
some Asian influences?
 

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:49.630
Interesting issues--issues that
can be brought home.

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:53.065
This kind of ambiguity
sometimes you encounter in

00:25:53.065 --> 00:25:54.210
klezmer music.
 

00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:57.328
What's klezmer music?
 

00:25:57.328 --> 00:26:01.125
Traditional Jewish folk music,
a lot of it coming out of

00:26:01.125 --> 00:26:02.298
Eastern Europe.
 

00:26:02.298 --> 00:26:05.980
So, we're going to listen to a
kind of souped up,

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.465
or rocked up,
version of some klezmer music

00:26:08.465 --> 00:26:11.386
here,
and they have a strong bass,

00:26:11.386 --> 00:26:13.660
electric bass underneath.
 

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:17.048
And we're going to listen
to--&gt;

00:26:17.048 --> 00:26:22.232
A minor melody with a leading
tone thrown in that gives it

00:26:22.232 --> 00:26:27.690
this kind of exotic feel and
then it will switch to major.

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:31.070
So, let's listen to this bit of
klezmer music go back and forth

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:32.490
between minor and major.
 

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:53.759
&gt;
 

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:55.730
Okay, so that's the intro.
 

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.544
Now, we're going to go onto the
shift to major here,

00:26:59.544 --> 00:27:01.190
another little clip.
 

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:13.619
&gt;
 

00:27:13.619 --> 00:27:15.420
So, there it's in major.
 

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.750
Let's listen a little bit more.
 

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:19.661
It's going to go back to minor
and then I think shift back to

00:27:19.661 --> 00:27:20.049
major.
 

00:27:20.049 --> 00:27:21.858
We'll be able to hear the shift.
 

00:27:21.858 --> 00:27:24.680
Turn it down just a little bit,
Lynda, please.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.529
&gt;
 

00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:30.288
Major or minor?
 

00:27:30.288 --> 00:27:34.309
Raise your left hand if you
think it's minor.

00:27:34.309 --> 00:27:36.990
What about this: major or minor?
 

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:38.750
Right hand if it's major,
left if it's minor.

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.200
This is major.
 

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:44.650
&gt;
 

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:50.413
Okay, that's a little bit of
this ambiguity between major and

00:27:50.413 --> 00:27:54.930
minor in a piece of traditional
Jewish music.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:28:01.765
Let's see, we've talked
about--let's talk about hearing,

00:28:01.765 --> 00:28:05.368
how we hear these melodies.
 

00:28:05.368 --> 00:28:09.730
The reason that we hear these
as distinctly different,

00:28:09.730 --> 00:28:13.680
I think, happens rather early
on in the scale.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.250
Let's think about this for a
minute.

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.559
We've got this scale up here.
 

00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:19.430
&gt;
 

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:20.549
If you go over to this scale.
 

00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:23.528
&gt;
 

00:28:23.528 --> 00:28:24.670
Does that sound dark?
 

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:25.430
I don't know.
 

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.853
Five hundred years ago,
that wouldn't have sounded

00:28:27.853 --> 00:28:28.200
dark.
 

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.089
Now, that sounds dark to us,
ominous.

00:28:30.089 --> 00:28:33.259
&gt;
 

00:28:33.259 --> 00:28:36.279
But that darkness occurs very
early in the scale.

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:37.730
As you can see there,
it's the third note.

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.900
We'll be talking about the fact
that this is an interval of a

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.756
third;
it spans three letter names a

00:28:41.756 --> 00:28:42.890
little bit later on.
 

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.759
So, that minor third can show
up very early in the scale.

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:49.461
That's a critical moment in any
scale, determining how we're

00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:51.029
going to feel about it.
 

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:54.727
We can just play with that
particular interval to change

00:28:54.727 --> 00:28:58.289
entirely the way we feel about
particular melodies.

00:28:58.289 --> 00:29:01.278
Here is a Christian song.
 

00:29:01.278 --> 00:29:04.358
I guess it's--&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:29:04.358 --> 00:29:06.403
"Joy to the world,
the Lord has come,"

00:29:06.403 --> 00:29:09.099
don't we sing it as a Christmas
carol, or some can sing it as a

00:29:09.099 --> 00:29:09.970
Christmas carol?
 

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:14.630
&gt;
 

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.980
Not much joy there.
 

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:17.980
You like that one?
 

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:28.180
How about-- &lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:38.630
Or my favorite
is--&gt;

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:41.430
You know, you can turn this
whole thing into a Jewish bar

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.078
mitzvah or something like that.
 

00:29:43.078 --> 00:29:46.464
You were singing with the Coen
Brothers down somewhere in,

00:29:46.464 --> 00:29:48.009
you know, in Appalachia.
 

00:29:48.009 --> 00:29:50.892
What was the wonderful movie
that had the Coen Brothers and

00:29:50.892 --> 00:29:53.029
all that great American folk
music in it?

00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:55.170
You Are My Sunshine,
Brother, Where Art Thou?

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:56.519
Wasn't that what it was
called?

00:29:56.519 --> 00:29:58.618
Brother, Where Art Thou?
Yeah.

00:29:58.618 --> 00:30:01.970
So, just that little turn of a
switch there.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:07.088
You can do some great things
with changing the mode.

00:30:07.088 --> 00:30:10.230
So, we've got scales that are
in the major mode;

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:11.868
we've got scales in the minor
mode.

00:30:11.868 --> 00:30:15.556
We also have scales in the
chromatic mode and that's when

00:30:15.556 --> 00:30:18.980
we don't have just seven pitches
within the scale.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.634
We're going to use all
of the pitches,

00:30:21.634 --> 00:30:22.720
all twelve here.
 

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:25.509
Chroma is the Greek word
for color.

00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:28.069
So, this is a more colorful
scale.

00:30:28.069 --> 00:30:32.910
What does it do for us?
 

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:35.799
&gt;
 

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:37.200
Well, that's a chromatic scale.
 

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:41.125
We had an example of that the
other day working with the

00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:42.910
Mozart--where was that?
 

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.359
In the Requiem.
 

00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:47.230
Oh phooey.
 

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.640
Yeah, remember we had--he was
coming up a minor scale.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.368
&gt;
 

00:30:55.368 --> 00:30:57.749
And then he,
at the top of it--&lt;&lt;plays

00:30:57.749 --> 00:30:58.578
scale&gt;&gt;
 

00:30:58.578 --> 00:31:00.858
--switched over into a
chromatic scale.

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:04.298
Here's the score.&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:31:04.298 --> 00:31:06.779
Minor.&lt;&lt;plays
piano&gt;&gt;

00:31:06.779 --> 00:31:07.980
Now chromatic.
 

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:17.309
&gt;
 

00:31:17.309 --> 00:31:19.220
What does this do to us?
 

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.528
Why did he do that?
 

00:31:20.528 --> 00:31:23.905
Well, chromaticism adds tension
to music and especially

00:31:23.905 --> 00:31:25.970
chromaticism that's pulling up.
 

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.160
Scales that go up add tension.
 

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.318
Music goes up generally in
tension--

00:31:29.318 --> 00:31:31.856
but if you can double that,
combine that with chromatic

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:34.784
music,
then you've got a sort of super

00:31:34.784 --> 00:31:38.174
whammy of tension,
and that's what he's doing

00:31:38.174 --> 00:31:42.407
there--trying to build tension
as the Just rise from the graves

00:31:42.407 --> 00:31:44.318
at that particular point.
 

00:31:44.318 --> 00:31:49.240
Entire compositions are rarely
written in the chromatic scale.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:54.148
Yeah, it's kind of a color that
you throw in from time to time

00:31:54.148 --> 00:31:55.838
for special effect.
 

00:31:55.838 --> 00:31:57.759
So, we've got the major/minor
scales;

00:31:57.759 --> 00:31:59.150
we've got the chromatic scales.
 

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:03.069
We also have what we call
conjunct melodies.

00:32:03.069 --> 00:32:04.568
&gt;
 

00:32:04.568 --> 00:32:07.471
Melodies that are just running
up and down a scale--

00:32:07.471 --> 00:32:08.609
neighboring tones.
 

00:32:08.609 --> 00:32:16.500
&gt;
 

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.874
Those are two Christmas carols
that are very conjunct in

00:32:20.874 --> 00:32:21.588
nature.
 

00:32:21.588 --> 00:32:25.815
A good example--we used it a
moment ago--of a disjunct melody

00:32:25.815 --> 00:32:28.140
is--&gt;
 

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.056
Can we all sing that?
 

00:32:29.056 --> 00:32:29.578
Here we go.
 

00:32:29.578 --> 00:32:33.333
Ready, sing,
"Take me out to the

00:32:33.333 --> 00:32:34.480
ballgame.
 

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.644
Take me out to the park,
etc…"

00:32:37.644 --> 00:32:42.277
It's amazing that that melody
has become as popular as it has

00:32:42.277 --> 00:32:46.059
given the fact that it's really
hard to sing.

00:32:46.059 --> 00:32:47.640
It's a very disjunct melody.
 

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.599
It's got all these odd leaps to
it.

00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:51.430
&gt;
 

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.338
Sounds like Schoenberg almost.
 

00:32:53.338 --> 00:32:56.858
It's sort of off the map here
in terms of disjunctness.

00:32:56.858 --> 00:32:59.259
But nonetheless,
we have been able to absorb all

00:32:59.259 --> 00:32:59.769
of that.
 

00:32:59.769 --> 00:33:03.170
So, melodies can be conjunct or
disjunct.

00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:06.901
And possibly the most conjunct
of all melodies in the history

00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:10.633
of music was the melody that we
looked at very briefly in the

00:33:10.633 --> 00:33:13.929
first gathering,
and that is Beethoven's famous

00:33:13.929 --> 00:33:15.190
Ode to Joy.
 

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:18.553
Now, Ludwig van Beethoven was
in his fifties when he was

00:33:18.553 --> 00:33:22.280
working on his last symphony--
what would prove to be his last

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.057
symphony--
his Ninth Symphony,

00:33:24.057 --> 00:33:27.565
and he'd been tinkering with
this particular melody all the

00:33:27.565 --> 00:33:31.489
way back to probably 1803,
so it's about twenty years or

00:33:31.489 --> 00:33:31.779
so.
 

00:33:31.779 --> 00:33:34.808
Ninth Symphony is 1823-1824.
 

00:33:34.808 --> 00:33:37.854
As early as 1803,
we know he's working

00:33:37.854 --> 00:33:40.568
on--&gt;
 

00:33:40.568 --> 00:33:42.410
Trying to get this to work just
right.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.727
And eventually,
over this twenty-year period he

00:33:44.727 --> 00:33:46.339
did get it to work just right.
 

00:33:46.339 --> 00:33:47.690
Let me swing this board around.
 

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:52.009
 
 

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:53.940
Here's the famous melody.
 

00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:58.132
I've put it in the key--what's
called the bass clef here--and

00:33:58.132 --> 00:33:59.670
it's in a major key.
 

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:03.701
We don't need to know what the
particular notes are,

00:34:03.701 --> 00:34:08.525
but let's look at this just for
a moment because it works well

00:34:08.525 --> 00:34:10.820
as a prototype of melody.
 

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:13.500
It does something that a lot of
melodies do.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.010
First of all,
as you can see by the

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.594
trajectory here,
it's very conjunct,

00:34:18.594 --> 00:34:21.400
right, all neighboring notes
here.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:24.340
If you look at the German of
the text, it has to do with

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.050
&gt;
 

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.030
. The millions be
embraced.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.829
And this, I believe,
is the sort of national anthem

00:34:30.829 --> 00:34:32.230
for the United Nations.
 

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.159
So, this has to be something
that we can all sing.

00:34:35.159 --> 00:34:38.519
And if you have conjunct
motion, that makes it easier.

00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:41.239
It's also very symmetrical.
 

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:44.083
As you can see,
it's nothing but a pattern of

00:34:44.083 --> 00:34:47.768
four bars plus four bars plus
four bars plus four bars.

00:34:47.768 --> 00:34:50.905
And, as we said before,
music has a syntax so that

00:34:50.905 --> 00:34:54.615
these phrases have to be in
a--arranged in a particular way

00:34:54.615 --> 00:34:55.960
that makes sense.
 

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.489
So, we start out here with an
opening phrase.

00:34:58.489 --> 00:35:03.570
&gt;
 

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.480
Is that the tonic?
 

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.389
Student:  No.
 

00:35:08.389 --> 00:35:10.559
Prof: Can anybody sing
the tonic?

00:35:10.559 --> 00:35:11.610
Student:
&gt;

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.480
Prof: Yeah,
yeah-- &gt;

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.679
Prof: The tonic is
actually over here.

00:35:16.679 --> 00:35:18.369
It's a little bit lower than
that.

00:35:18.369 --> 00:35:19.960
That was a really hard question.
 

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.480
I'm amazed that anybody got it.
 

00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:22.510
Good for you.
 

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.893
So, what happens here is this
opening phrase,

00:35:24.893 --> 00:35:27.983
that we'll call A--musicians
like to label stuff just with

00:35:27.983 --> 00:35:30.260
alphabetical labels to keep it
simple.

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.420
We'll call this phrase A.
 

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.681
It sort of opens things up,
and we refer to this as the

00:35:35.681 --> 00:35:36.889
antecedent phrase.
 

00:35:36.889 --> 00:35:41.039
The next phrase,
B--&gt;

00:35:41.039 --> 00:35:44.297
is very similar,
but here it takes the

00:35:44.297 --> 00:35:47.380
deviation--&lt;&amp;
lt;sings&gt;&gt;

00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.840
And gets it back--gets us back
to the tonic.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.173
Now, we could walk out the door
at that point,

00:35:52.173 --> 00:35:52.590
right?
 

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.070
&gt;
 

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.159
We're feeling tonally stable
there.

00:35:55.159 --> 00:35:57.239
We've got it all together for
the rest of the day.

00:35:57.239 --> 00:35:59.030
However, it would be a pretty
short melody.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:02.059
So, what he then does is write
an extension.

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:03.300
We'll call this C.
 

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:09.880
&gt;
 

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.349
Very interesting.
 

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:12.829
Put an asterisk by this.
 

00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:15.590
Beethoven, in a way,
saved this melody.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:19.188
He rescued this melody,
which was in danger of becoming

00:36:19.188 --> 00:36:21.920
excessively four-square,
by doing what?

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:29.250
If I had been writing
it--&gt;

00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:30.900
What did Beethoven do here?
 

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.159
We talked about it last time,
a rhythmic device.

00:36:34.159 --> 00:36:35.219
Syncopation.
 

00:36:35.219 --> 00:36:38.246
He brings his opening note,
that F-sharp,

00:36:38.246 --> 00:36:39.610
in a beat early.
 

00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.163
This should,
you would think,

00:36:41.163 --> 00:36:43.992
be a half note and this would
start on the downbeat,

00:36:43.992 --> 00:36:44.768
over here.
 

00:36:44.768 --> 00:36:46.949
But he brings,
in effect, the sound of the

00:36:46.949 --> 00:36:49.768
downbeat in a beat early,
gives it a little bit of pep

00:36:49.768 --> 00:36:51.630
there at that particular point.
 

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.039
And then what is this here?
 

00:36:54.039 --> 00:36:59.518
&gt;
 

00:36:59.518 --> 00:37:03.000
Well, of course it's a
replication of B.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.400
We've got to end on the tonic.
 

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.972
All pieces, classical or pop,
one way or the other,

00:37:08.972 --> 00:37:10.329
end on the tonic.
 

00:37:10.329 --> 00:37:15.771
Okay, so let's have us,
now--let me put a fermata over

00:37:15.771 --> 00:37:16.489
this.
 

00:37:16.489 --> 00:37:18.650
Let's all sing this.
 

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:20.500
I think it--we don't have to
read the notes.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.090
You don't have to sing any
texts;

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:23.760
we're just going to sing
"la."

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.530
I'll conduct in four,
so sit back.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:29.690
&gt;
 

00:37:29.690 --> 00:37:32.010
Everybody vocally prepared here?
 

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.250
Here we go.
 

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:38.110
I'll give you one,
two, ready, sing.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.769
&gt;
 

00:37:40.769 --> 00:37:43.239
Louder, louder.
 

00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:47.449
&gt;
 

00:37:47.449 --> 00:37:48.960
Good.
 

00:37:48.960 --> 00:38:20.449
&gt;
 

00:38:20.449 --> 00:38:22.570
We'll put a big ritard
on it there.

00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:25.121
So, we wanted to bang that
syncopation and then,

00:38:25.121 --> 00:38:28.382
of course, there's no sound on
the downbeat over here to make

00:38:28.382 --> 00:38:29.739
the syncopation work.
 

00:38:29.739 --> 00:38:31.289
So, that's the melody.
 

00:38:31.289 --> 00:38:34.123
Seems very simple,
but took Beethoven a long time

00:38:34.123 --> 00:38:37.014
to iron all this out and make
this perfect melody,

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:39.199
the prototypical melody in a
way.

00:38:39.199 --> 00:38:42.518
And then in the early eighteen
twenties, he decided to

00:38:42.518 --> 00:38:45.965
incorporate this as the main
theme of the last movement,

00:38:45.965 --> 00:38:48.219
the finale of his last
symphony.

00:38:48.219 --> 00:38:50.646
So, this is some of the last
music that Beethoven wrote in

00:38:50.646 --> 00:38:52.518
the setting that we're about to
listen to.

00:38:52.518 --> 00:38:56.032
So, let's listen,
we're not going to--I think

00:38:56.032 --> 00:38:57.949
Lynda has it set here.
 

00:38:57.949 --> 00:39:00.637
We're going to hear the
beginning of this and he

00:39:00.637 --> 00:39:03.039
presents this as a series of
variations.

00:39:03.039 --> 00:39:06.619
So here is the first
presentation of our melody.

00:39:06.619 --> 00:39:07.489
&gt;
 

00:39:07.489 --> 00:39:09.130
Nice and loud.
 

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:09.831
&gt;
 

00:39:09.831 --> 00:39:11.269
Student: 
&gt;

00:39:11.269 --> 00:39:12.570
Prof: That's okay.
 

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:39.340
&gt;
 

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:44.429
Prof: And then he
repeats C and B.

00:39:44.429 --> 00:39:54.389
&gt;
 

00:39:54.389 --> 00:39:56.150
Okay, now let's pause it there.
 

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:57.619
Let's pause it right there.
 

00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:00.362
Now, we're going to go on to
the second presentation of the

00:40:00.362 --> 00:40:03.010
theme, and I have three
questions for you as we do so.

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:06.429
Where has the theme--the
melody--gone here?

00:40:06.429 --> 00:40:10.860
Is this a motive or a theme,
by the way?

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.369
Student: 
&gt;

00:40:11.369 --> 00:40:13.159
Prof: Theme,
it's not a motive.

00:40:13.159 --> 00:40:14.429
It's way too long.
 

00:40:14.429 --> 00:40:15.760
It's a good example of a theme.
 

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.380
It's way too long for a motive.
 

00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.590
Motive would only go about
four, five, six notes.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:23.047
So, we have this beautiful
theme here and as we listen to

00:40:23.047 --> 00:40:25.704
this next presentation,
where has the theme,

00:40:25.704 --> 00:40:26.940
or melody, gone?
 

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:29.489
What instruments are playing it
now?

00:40:29.489 --> 00:40:31.920
What is the texture like?
 

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:36.150
How many lines can you hear in
this texture?

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:39.400
How many strands of music do
you hear--can you pick up?

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.610
And thirdly,
what is this texture called?

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:46.228
Last time we said we had three
kinds of texture in music which

00:40:46.228 --> 00:40:48.900
are: monophonic,
homophonic and polyphonic.

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:51.699
Which is this particular
texture?

00:40:51.699 --> 00:40:52.920
Okay, here we go.
 

00:40:52.920 --> 00:41:47.469
&gt;
 

00:41:47.469 --> 00:41:48.730
So, what do you think?
 

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:54.092
How many lines--first of all,
where has the melody gone--the

00:41:54.092 --> 00:41:54.820
theme?
 

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.480
Student: 
&gt;

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.931
Prof: It's gone up a
little bit and it's being played

00:41:58.931 --> 00:42:00.219
by what instruments?
 

00:42:00.219 --> 00:42:02.311
Yeah, strings,
violins, violins,

00:42:02.311 --> 00:42:05.079
but not the top part of the
violin family,

00:42:05.079 --> 00:42:08.387
kind of second violin,
middle range of the strings

00:42:08.387 --> 00:42:09.130
here.
 

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.469
How many parts do you hear in
it?

00:42:11.469 --> 00:42:12.949
How many separate musical lines
there?

00:42:12.949 --> 00:42:14.260
Marcus?
 

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:14.686
Student:  Three..
 

00:42:14.686 --> 00:42:15.059
Prof: Three.
 

00:42:15.059 --> 00:42:16.389
Tell us about those three.
 

00:42:16.389 --> 00:42:19.744
We've just talked about one of
them--the melody and the violins

00:42:19.744 --> 00:42:20.340
up above.
 

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.690
Can you tell us about some of
the others?

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.480
Student: 
&gt;

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.208
Prof: Okay,
they're doing like a

00:42:28.208 --> 00:42:29.789
counterpoint,
right.

00:42:29.789 --> 00:42:31.449
They're doing-- yeah, okay.
 

00:42:31.449 --> 00:42:34.010
It's too easy. I'm sorry.
 

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.380
I had to go for that.
 

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.460
They are playing a contrapuntal
line.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:42.286
But you're absolutely right,
that's the key point and that

00:42:42.286 --> 00:42:44.420
then answers,
Marcus, what's the texture.

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:47.280
If you've got a--Marcus, please?
 

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:47.882
Student:  Polyphonic..
 

00:42:47.882 --> 00:42:48.550
Prof: Yeah,
polyphonic.

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:50.150
So, this is polyphony here.
 

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.869
What was the third voice?
 

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:55.317
If we had melody up above in
kind of a counterpoint,

00:42:55.317 --> 00:42:57.751
as Marcus says,
there, in the middle,

00:42:57.751 --> 00:43:01.739
what was the--we had one other
part, and what was that?

00:43:01.739 --> 00:43:02.869
Well, let's listen a little
more.

00:43:02.869 --> 00:43:04.489
We've identified the melody.
 

00:43:04.489 --> 00:43:18.380
 
 

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:24.503
Let's just see if we can pick
up what the missing third part

00:43:24.503 --> 00:43:25.230
here.
 

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.079
It's a bassoon playing the
contrapuntal line.

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:49.929
&gt;
 

00:43:49.929 --> 00:43:53.219
Prof: So,
what is the third part there?

00:43:53.219 --> 00:43:55.239
The bass, yeah.
 

00:43:55.239 --> 00:44:04.032
Usually, you're going to have a
melody and you're going to have

00:44:04.032 --> 00:44:10.838
a bass, so the bass is doing
stuff--&lt;&lt;plays

00:44:10.838 --> 00:44:13.250
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.710
--underneath there.
 

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:17.851
So, there's the melody up
above, this bassoon playing the

00:44:17.851 --> 00:44:19.690
counterpoint,
kind of in the middle,

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:22.170
and then the bass playing these
notes quietly underneath.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:24.119
It's a little bit hard to hear.
 

00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:26.989
I think we have time.
 

00:44:26.989 --> 00:44:31.139
Let's just continue right from
there a little bit more.

00:44:31.139 --> 00:44:34.570
&gt;
 

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.769
Can you hear the bass, now?
 

00:44:36.769 --> 00:44:52.460
&gt;
 

00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:54.840
There's the bassoon,
counterpoint.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:45:03.280
&gt;
 

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:06.202
Okay, and let's listen to just
a little--we're going to pause

00:45:06.202 --> 00:45:06.739
it there.
 

00:45:06.739 --> 00:45:09.119
Now, let's listen to,
must be, what,

00:45:09.119 --> 00:45:12.179
the third presentation,
here, of the theme.

00:45:12.179 --> 00:45:13.619
Where's the theme now?
 

00:45:13.619 --> 00:45:17.019
Now, how many parts are there
in the texture?

00:45:17.019 --> 00:45:52.010
&gt;
 

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:53.630
What about that?
 

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:55.630
Well, it's a little bit hard to
tell exactly,

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.130
isn't it?
 

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:56.980
It's hard to tell.
 

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:00.130
What could you say for sure
about it?

00:46:00.130 --> 00:46:01.750
You've got a melody.
 

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:03.059
Where's it going now?
 

00:46:03.059 --> 00:46:04.530
It's going up.
 

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.199
It's all now in the first
violins.

00:46:06.199 --> 00:46:08.070
What else is in there?
 

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:08.449
Student: 
&gt;

00:46:08.449 --> 00:46:10.460
Prof: A bass,
yeah, we got a bass.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:13.539
And now we--what else?
 

00:46:13.539 --> 00:46:16.469
Some other stuff in the middle,
all right?

00:46:16.469 --> 00:46:18.530
And that's--that may be about
as much as we can do with that.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.800
I mean, really, myself included.
 

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.873
I could sort of sit there and
try to track the lines,

00:46:22.873 --> 00:46:23.989
but I'd have to repeat it.
 

00:46:23.989 --> 00:46:26.702
So, I think if we said we've
got melody, we've got theme,

00:46:26.702 --> 00:46:28.690
we've got bass,
we've got a bunch of other

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:31.210
stuff in the middle,
that's just fine and dandy.

00:46:31.210 --> 00:46:33.835
But the idea that they're all
kind of independent,

00:46:33.835 --> 00:46:37.320
points out once again that they
are playing polyphonic texture.

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:40.099
Let's listen to the end of the
polyphonic texture,

00:46:40.099 --> 00:46:42.539
then Beethoven,
and we'll stop with this.

00:46:42.539 --> 00:46:45.896
Beethoven was like a military
general, interesting the way he

00:46:45.896 --> 00:46:48.360
operated, always setting up
these battles.

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.369
And indeed, he wrote something
called a Battle Symphony,

00:46:50.369 --> 00:46:52.675
and you can just see him,
how he's kind of marshalling

00:46:52.675 --> 00:46:55.023
particular forces to do
particular things at particular

00:46:55.023 --> 00:46:55.460
times.
 

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:58.219
So, held back here the heavy
artillery.

00:46:58.219 --> 00:47:01.780
The heavy artillery in the
orchestra is what?

00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.389
The brass and sometimes
percussion.

00:47:03.389 --> 00:47:06.409
So, it's the brass he's going
to bring in at this point.

00:47:06.409 --> 00:47:10.284
So, we'll listen to the end of
the third presentation of this

00:47:10.284 --> 00:47:13.579
with the contrapuntal idea
dominated by strings,

00:47:13.579 --> 00:47:16.065
melody, bass,
other stuff in the middle and

00:47:16.065 --> 00:47:19.969
then he will bring in the brass
for the final statement of this.

00:47:19.969 --> 00:47:24.481
And I think our time is about
up, so we'll listen to this and

00:47:24.481 --> 00:47:28.769
you can go out as we hear the
fourth statement of this.

00:47:28.769 --> 00:48:32.690
&gt;
 

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:39.000

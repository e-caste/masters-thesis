00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.320
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.810
So I left you at the end of
last lecture with this

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.390
incredible cliffhanger I put
up on the slide, but...

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.760
So let me get a running start
and let you know where we

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.280
were, finish up that lecture,
and then move in to

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.860
the topics for today.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.050
So as you recall, at the end of
last lecture I was talking

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.250
about a particular critique
which has been offered by

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.919
contemporary social
psychologists of Aristotle's

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.350
moral theory.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.610
As you recall, Aristotle has a
moral theory whose fundamental

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.755
notion is that of the person
with good character--the one

00:00:41.755 --> 00:00:45.700
who acts as the well-raised one,
the person with practical

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.070
wisdom would act.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.162
Aristotle calls that person
the phronimos.

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:55.120
And John Doris, in the essay
we read, gave voice to a

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.850
concern which a number of
philosophers have expressed in

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.060
recent years, which is the
concern that Aristotle's moral

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.710
theory commits a mistake.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.120
It commits what psychologists
call the fundamental

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.730
attribution error.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.080
And that's the idea that it's
character rather than

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.500
circumstance that's the primary
determinant of action.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.010
And Doris adduced a number of
psychological studies that

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.000
purport to show that the primary
determinant of action

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.870
is circumstance rather
than some standing

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.490
feature of the person.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.430
So he told us the story of the
guys in the phone booth and

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.605
suggested that it's a local
feature of mood that

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:41.540
determines whether people are
likely to be helpful rather

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.520
than a standing feature
of character.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.250
He told us the story of the Good
Samaritan study, again

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.215
suggesting that it was
circumstance or situation that

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:51.125
affected behavior, not

00:01:51.125 --> 00:01:52.700
standing features of character.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.865
We ourselves read and thought
about the Milgram experiments:

00:01:57.865 --> 00:02:00.550
circumstances in which people
find themselves behaving in

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.640
ways that one might think
are out of character.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.860
And we talked about previously,
and we'll talk

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.240
about it again, the idea of
moral luck: the idea that one

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.500
may find oneself in
circumstances

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.400
that lead to behavior.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.980
So there is no doubt that there
is an element of truth

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.200
to the claim that circumstance
is a major

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.190
contributor to behavior.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.442
It's undeniable that there are
circumstances that contribute

00:02:32.442 --> 00:02:35.830
to how it is that people act.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.375
But that strand of social
psychology that Doris is

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:44.250
stressing is, I think, only
part of the story.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.800
So in addition to circumstance
contributing to character,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.305
there's a large body of research
in psychology known

00:02:53.305 --> 00:02:58.740
as personality psychology which
looks at a set of traits

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.790
that seem to be pretty well
established in people by their

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.990
first year of life.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.570
These are traits that are quite
stable over time, and

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.800
that end up correlating with a
large range of other measures.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.570
These are things like openness
to new experience,

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.540
conscientiousness in carrying
out responsibilities,

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.520
extroversion as opposed to
introversion, agreeableness,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.030
and neuroticism: a certain
kind of anxiety.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.090
So although it is the case
that circumstance plays a

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.750
major role in determining how
it is that people behave, it

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.460
is also the case that there
are contributions from

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.170
individual personality.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.210
And one of the most dramatic
pieces of evidence in favor of

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.136
that are Walter Mischel's famous
deferred gratification

00:03:57.136 --> 00:04:00.550
studies which I'll discuss
now and then again

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.910
later in the lecture.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.330
It looks like, if Mischel's
studies which involve

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.440
thousands and thousands of
children are to be trusted,

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.620
that the early capacity for
self-regulation or delay of

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.420
gratification in the face
of temptation is highly

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:23.500
predictive of all sorts of
things ranging from SAT scores

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.670
to social relations in school.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.470
Social and cognitive functions
seem to correlate with the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.000
certain features about
early experience.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.280
So although it is undoubtedly
the case that the situationist

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.690
critique gets something right
and it is undoubtedly a

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.480
mistake to think that the sole
contribution to behavior is

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.660
character, and that the features
of the environment

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.170
play no role, to say that only
contribution to behavior is

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.330
circumstance and that there's no
contribution on the part of

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.020
the individual is, I
think, a mistake.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.580
And those of you who are
interested in looking at what

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.540
those individual differences
look like in children early on

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.060
may enjoy watching some of the
videos of the Mischel studies

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.080
where you get to see children
sitting in front of

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.080
marshmallows, looking
like this, or

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:25.110
this, or this, or this.

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.610
Or--poor thing--she's destined
for low SAT scores, but wow is

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.770
that marshmallow going
to taste good.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.730
So any of you who wants to watch
some of these, here are

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.370
three very different
presentations of the

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.700
marshmallow case.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.860
And again, these slides will be
up so you can go get them

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:43.270
off the Internet.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.470
OK.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.170
So that's the closing of last
lecture, and obviously a

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:52.450
straightforward segue way into
the topic of today's lecture

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:57.040
which is the question in some
ways with which we began this

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.050
section of the course: the
question of strategies for

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:06.060
regulating oneself in the face
of weakness of the will.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.830
Now, what we emphasized in last
lecture was Aristotle's

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.920
picture of what it takes for
someone to be virtuous.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.360
And Aristotle said that in order
to be virtuous, you need

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.250
to satisfy four conditions.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.380
You need to know what's the
right thing to do, you need to

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.720
decide to do that thing because
it's the right thing,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.170
you need to do so stably, and
you need to do so in a way

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.440
that doesn't cut against
your inclinations.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.800
Those are the four features
that are required to be

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.822
virtuous on Aristotle's
picture.

00:06:37.822 --> 00:06:42.220
And corresponding to virtue on
the other end of the spectrum,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:47.140
is the Aristotelian notion of
vice which is basically its

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.710
exact opposite.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.150
It's a harmonious, stable,
knowledgeable, decided

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.010
tendency to act in keeping with
exactly what's wrong.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.970
So the vicious person has
knowledge of what's the wrong

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.830
thing to do, decides to do it
because it's the wrong thing,

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.290
stably does so, and doesn't feel
any inclination to do the

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.590
right thing.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:15.660
So those are two ends of the
Aristotelian spectrum.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.680
In fact, there are two things
which lie a bit beyond the end

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.805
of the Aristotelian spectrum.

00:07:19.805 --> 00:07:23.440
As you know from you reading
guide, Aristotle also

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.380
identifies the notion somewhat
akin to the state that

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.830
Jonathan Shay calls
the berserk state.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.330
This is the state that Aristotle
calls bestiality, a

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.080
state below virtue and vice.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.500
And he gives examples from some
of the Greek tragedies of

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.116
tearing a body apart
limb from limb.

00:07:41.116 --> 00:07:45.130
So Aristotle thinks it's
possible to move out of the

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.390
moral realm altogether.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.430
Vice, on the Aristotelian
picture, is still a kind of

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.470
stable and predictable way
to act in the world.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.800
Bestiality lies below that.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:04.100
And above virtue lies this
idea of divinity: a state

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.750
whereby regulating
with respect to

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:10.170
virtue isn't even required.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.490
But the heart of the discussion
that we read in

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:17.490
chapter seven of Aristotle's
Ethics for today concerns

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.410
itself with this
range of states

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.502
between virtue and vice.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.790
And Aristotle gives a really
nice taxonomy of those which I

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:30.430
think is helpful for
understanding what it is to

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.680
engage in self-regulation.

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.760
I should stress that I am no
Aristotle scholar, and that

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.060
what I'm providing is
a somewhat contrived

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:39.832
reconstruction.

00:08:39.832 --> 00:08:43.400
But I think it's helpful for
getting a handle on what these

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.556
distinctions amount to.

00:08:45.556 --> 00:08:49.940
So we might ask first, what
would a state look like that

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.840
shares with virtue that one
has knowledge of the right

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.070
thing to do, that one decides to
do it for that reason, and

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:00.800
that one has the inclination,
but that lacks a kind of

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.940
character, or logical stability,
that Aristotle

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.690
takes to be a hallmark
of true virtue?

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.090
That, I think, is the state
that Aristotle calls

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.230
temperance.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.520
One's inclined to do the
right thing because

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.440
it's the right thing.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.220
And one knows what the
right thing is.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.290
But there isn't the sort of
predictable, law-like,

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:25.336
stability of character
that virtue requires.

00:09:25.336 --> 00:09:28.790
Corresponding to temperance,
on the other side of the

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.436
scale, is what Aristotle calls
intemperance which is, in some

00:09:33.436 --> 00:09:36.650
sense, the mirror image
of temperance.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.960
Here one is simply inclined to
do the wrong thing because

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:42.620
it's the wrong thing.

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:48.840
But not as a hard feature of
character in the way that he

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.340
gives in the case of vice,
but just as a matter of

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:53.500
temperament.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:57.560
So the temperate person,
with inclination,

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.230
does the right thing.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.910
They're inclined to do
the right thing and

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.586
they act in that way.

00:10:02.586 --> 00:10:07.480
The intemperate person, with
inclination, does the wrong

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.080
thing and feels no conflict
in the face of it.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.200
What happens if we remove
another one of the

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.710
Aristotelian features?

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.440
What happens if we have
knowledge of what's the right

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:25.050
thing to do and the decision to
do the right thing, but our

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.830
inclination pulls us in
the other direction?

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:33.780
So we have made a decision to
act in keeping with what's

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:39.180
right, at least at an abstract
level if not a concrete one,

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.760
we have a sense of
what's right.

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.380
Aristotle says, and I put this
approximation in front of the

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.225
knowledge that "what the
continent and incontinent

00:10:47.225 --> 00:10:52.470
person have is the recognition
of the general rule, but some

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.680
difficulty recognizing whether
the general rule applies in

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.200
this particular case." So the
continent person has a sense

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:05.200
of what the right thing to do
is, has made a decision to act

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:09.510
in keeping with that, but her
inclination pulls her in

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.070
another direction.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.810
She finds it difficult to avoid
the chocolate cake.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:18.610
She finds it difficult to get
up when her alarm rings.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.160
She finds it difficult to resist
the marshmallow in

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.640
order to get the second.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:28.010
But somehow she contains herself
and acts against her

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.592
inclination.

00:11:29.592 --> 00:11:33.276
The mirror image of the
continent person is

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:36.332
Aristotle's incontinent
person.

00:11:36.332 --> 00:11:40.350
In terms of their decision,
they are like

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:41.540
the continent one.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:46.420
They want to do the thing that
corresponds with morality.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.810
Like the continent person,
they have a sense of the

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:51.580
general rule, a little
difficulty seeing how it

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.187
applies in this particular
case.

00:11:53.187 --> 00:11:57.160
And like the continent person,
they have an inclination to go

00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.890
towards a pleasure which
attracts them.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.490
But unlike the continent person,
the incontinent person

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:08.740
finds herself unable to overcome
the inclination.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.670
And so, below the line,
she acts in

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.036
keeping with what's wrong.

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:20.450
Finally, Aristotle considers
a pair of cases where the

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.270
attraction to doing the wrong
thing is not a desire for a

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:28.660
pleasure, but a desire
to avoid pain.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.980
So in some cases, one doesn't
get full credit for being

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.100
continent, one doesn't resist a
pleasure, but one is willing

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.470
to put up with a certain amount
of discomfort in the

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.210
face of doing the right thing.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.610
Aristotle calls that resistance:
continence in the

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.281
face of pain.

00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:51.980
And corresponding to that, below
the line, is softness:

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.770
incontinence in the
face of pain.

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:58.440
Doing the wrong thing because
one has given in to a certain

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.254
kind of discomfort.

00:13:01.254 --> 00:13:05.210
So I put this list before you
because I think it's not

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:10.500
completely clear on a first
read, or a second, or a third,

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:15.870
or a fourth through Book Seven
of Aristotle's Ethics, how

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:20.030
carefully structured Aristotle's
picture of the

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:23.900
human soul and its strengths
and weaknesses is.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:27.510
But I think that if we see
it as a set of paired

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:33.350
characteristics, each of which
lacks or has certain of the

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:37.880
features of paradigmatic
Aristotelian virtue, then we

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:41.300
can get a pretty clear sense
of what the Aristotelian

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.290
picture looks like.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.370
And I encourage you, armed with
this framework, to go

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.965
back to the text which we've
been reading over and over in

00:13:50.965 --> 00:13:54.230
this class: the text at the end
of Book One and beginning

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:56.540
of Book Two of Aristotle's
Ethics.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.920
And try, yet again, to see what
the picture of virtue is

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.200
that Aristotle is
concerned with.

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.470
So what I want to do in the
remainder of the lecture today

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:12.970
-- and we're going to need our
clickers pretty soon --

00:14:12.970 --> 00:14:19.790
is to talk about Aristotle's
idea of incontinence.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.950
What it is to be in a situation
where one knows what

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.110
the right thing to do
is, in the abstract.

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:29.670
One's committed to doing
the right thing.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.470
But one has an inclination
that pulls in the other

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.600
direction, and one gives
in to that inclination.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:41.363
So we're to ask, by starting
to give you a choice.

00:14:41.363 --> 00:14:44.518
And let me say, this
is a real poll.

00:14:44.518 --> 00:14:48.705
I have here the money, right
here in this envelope.

00:14:48.705 --> 00:14:51.750
And I have here --

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:52.380
I'm not kidding --

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.620
I have here a class list. And
during the ten seconds that

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.180
you're answering this poll, I
will close my eyes and select

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.720
a name from the class list. So
I'm asking you right now.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.694
You'll have 10 seconds once
I start the timer to

00:15:06.694 --> 00:15:07.930
choose what you want.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:13.180
One of you is really going to
get either $5 right now, or $6

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:14.511
on Thursday.

00:15:14.511 --> 00:15:16.750
And It could be you.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:17.130
OK.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.180
So clickers out.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:32.079
We have 10 seconds left.

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:33.000
OK.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.579
So let's see what the responses
are on this.

00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:37.784
OK.

00:15:37.784 --> 00:15:40.700
22% of you want $5 now.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.690
78% of you want $6
in two days.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:45.329
Sarah Cox?

00:15:45.329 --> 00:15:47.833
Sarah Cox, are you here?

00:15:47.833 --> 00:15:49.500
Sarah Cox, which
did you choose?

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.450
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:51.780
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:55.560
Well, I'll keep this right with
me, and I'll put it in my

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:56.690
copy of Aristotle's Ethics.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.890
So I'm good for my word.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.610
OK.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:03.170
22% of you, however, would
be just getting the

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:04.580
envelope right now.

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.780
OK, second poll.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.380
Which do you choose?

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:10.160
And again, I have money.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.090
I have a second envelope.

00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.110
It's in my bag.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:20.200
And you can choose $5 in 35
days, or $6 in 37 days.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.100
OK?

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:25.700
$5 in 35 days, or
$6 in 37 days.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:26.610
Polling open.

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:27.630
Ten seconds.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.230
Ten, nine, eight --

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:33.820
$5, 35 days. $6 in 37 days.

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:38.030
And let's see how the
numbers came out.

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.980
OK.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:42.100
All right.

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.270
You experimental error folks are
very good at showing the

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.100
experimental error aspect of
pushing buttons on these.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.160
Or maybe, maybe there are
some of you who see

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.410
this as being different.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:17:00.520
OK, 20% of you were preferring
to take $5 today over 6$ on

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:05.150
Thursday, even though almost
none of you wanted to take the

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.000
same decision in a month.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.860
Now, let me point something out
to you which, of course,

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.400
to the rational part of your
soul is completely obvious.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:19.630
These bets are identical.

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:24.860
I offered you $5 on the 15th
versus $6 on the 17th.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:34.200
Or I offered you $5 on the 22nd
versus $6 on the 24th.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:40.280
When it comes to the 22nd of
March, oh 22% of you, who gave

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.320
different answers in these two
cases, you will be in exactly

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.450
the same situation with respect
to the $5 and $6 that

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:52.940
you are with respect to the
$5 and $6 right now.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:59.090
There's no difference between
this choice and this choice.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:05.920
Nonetheless, it turns out to be
consistently the case that

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:12.880
human beings and non-human
animals have a tendency to

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:18.430
start acting differently towards
delayed rewards when

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:23.190
they are happening in the far
future and when they are

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.660
happening in the near future.

00:18:26.660 --> 00:18:32.497
So for many decades the
psychologist, George Ainslie,

00:18:32.497 --> 00:18:38.890
has studied decisions that have
the following structure.

00:18:38.890 --> 00:18:43.210
One has a choice between a
smaller reward that one can

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:49.010
get sooner, like the $5 as
opposed to the $6, or a larger

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:53.540
reward that one can get later.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:59.300
And Ainslie has studied this
phenomenon in the context of

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.370
human and non-human animals.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:06.210
And I'm going to read aloud a
quote to you, which will be up

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:10.745
on the slides on the web site,
that gives you a sense of what

00:19:10.745 --> 00:19:12.340
this phenomenon amounts to.

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.010
Ainslie calls it hyperbolic
discounting.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:20.710
And he says "people often, and
lower animals always, discount

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.070
the prospect of future rewards
in a curve that's more deeply

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.420
bowed than a rational,
exponential curve."

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:33.050
So it's perfectly rational to
discount future rewards if

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.280
there's uncertainty
involved, right?

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:40.320
If I offered you $5 now or $6
in 20 years, it would make

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.440
perfect sense to take the $5
now because your degree of

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.370
uncertainty about whether
you would get the $6 is

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.580
sufficiently great with respect
to your degree of

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.580
certainty that you
would get the $5.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.320
But the difference, I hope,
between thinking whether you

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.150
and I and this classroom are
going to be around this

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:04.570
Thursday, as opposed to three
weeks from now on a Thursday,

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:06.880
is trivial.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.480
"Over a range of delays,"
continues Ainslie, "from

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:14.260
seconds to decades, there are
pairs of alternative rewards

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.820
such that subjects prefer the
smaller, earlier reward over

00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.370
the larger later alternative
when the delay to the smaller

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:23.650
reward will be short." Right?

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:26.470
Those of you who preferred
$5 today as

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:28.730
opposed to $6 on Thursday.

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.680
"But prefer the larger, later
reward when the smaller

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.520
alternative will be more
delayed." $5 in 35 days versus

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.620
$6 in 37 days.

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.695
"Even though the time from the
earlier to the later reward

00:20:41.695 --> 00:20:44.120
stays the same.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.570
The curves that fit the
observed data best are

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.770
hyperbolic.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.190
That is, they show value as
inversely proportional to

00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:53.300
delay."

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:59.680
So again, what happens is, that
for a period of time, A,

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.050
the larger reward is preferred
to the smaller one, right?

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:03.780
That's you.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:05.170
It's in 37 days.

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.490
It's in 36 days.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:07.540
It's in 35 days.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.420
It's in 34 days.

00:21:09.420 --> 00:21:14.700
All that time, you prefer the
$6 two days later to the $5

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.250
now, or to the $5 two
days earlier.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.610
And then all of a sudden as
the event draws near, the

00:21:22.610 --> 00:21:29.690
value of the smaller reward
looms larger in your mind.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:34.590
Decision after decision
has this structure.

00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:40.120
Suppose you want to train to be
a competitive cyclist, or

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:45.120
some sort of athletic endeavor,
that's your larger,

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.446
later reward.

00:21:47.446 --> 00:21:50.400
Suppose that one of the things
that's incompatible with your

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:55.490
becoming a competitive cyclist
is the eating of Crisco

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.160
covered cupcakes.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.240
You're walking along, and at the
beginning it's completely

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.220
clear to you that what you
prefer is to be a cyclist. You

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.290
wake up in the morning, you say:
"what I'm going to do is

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:09.910
plan for my bicycling.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.960
I'm not going to be distracted
by stupid things like Crisco

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:16.045
covered cupcakes." And you walk
along and still to you

00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:19.230
now, there's your eyes, you
see ahh, the reward of the

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.625
bicycle is greater than the
reward of the cupcake.

00:22:21.625 --> 00:22:27.980
And all of a sudden as the
cupcake grows nearer, you take

00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.920
the smaller, sooner reward and
the larger, later falls out

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.890
from possibility.

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:38.190
Suppose you resolve that
tomorrow morning you're going

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:46.190
to get up super early to write
your paper for Philosophy 181,

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.020
COGSCI 281.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.460
And so you set your alarm,
and you have the

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.470
ringing of the alarm.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.790
And when you go to bed
you set it for 5:30.

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:01.260
You can see that larger later
reward is a bigger one.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.780
And it comes to be 5:30 in the
morning and the alarm is

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:07.240
ringing, and you turn it off.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:11.970
And oops, away goes the
possibility of the larger,

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:13.740
later reward.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.500
Or suppose you're one of
Mischel's subjects in the

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.370
marshmallow study.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.765
Here's your larger, later
reward: two marshmallows.

00:23:20.765 --> 00:23:24.000
Here's your smaller, sooner
reward: one marshmallow.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.410
Ask in the abstract, it's
pretty clear to you two

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:29.840
marshmallows is definitely
better than one

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.230
marshmallow until --

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.950
until what?

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.650
Until you're sitting in the room
with the one marshmallow

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:40.480
and oops, you lost
your chance.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:44.025
So what I want to do in the
remainder of the lecture

00:23:44.025 --> 00:23:48.160
today, is talk a little bit
about the psychological state

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:52.780
of the children involved in
Mischel's studies, and then

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.650
connect that for you to some
more general research on

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.090
self-regulation.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:02.910
And finally connect that to the
discussion of principles

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:07.500
that we had in our reading
from Nozick today.

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.900
So when Walter Mischel began
doing these marshmallow

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:16.412
studies roughly 40 years ago,
there was a theory in place

00:24:16.412 --> 00:24:21.730
that the best way to engage in
self-regulation was to think

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.780
about the reward that you were
going to get if you did the

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.310
right thing.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:29.920
So on that theory, the best
way for kids to be able to

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.240
resist the one marshmallow
in order to get the two

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.360
marshmallows would be for the
experimenter to make it

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.660
incredibly vivid to them that
if they waited, they could

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:44.230
have two marshmallows.

00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:49.360
So kids were brought into the
room in one of two conditions.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.970
In one of the conditions, there
was one marshmallow over

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.250
here and two marshmallows
over there.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.386
The rewards were visible.

00:24:56.386 --> 00:24:57.980
The kids came in.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:03.380
And they lasted, on average,
about four minutes before they

00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:06.520
reached over and grabbed the
single marshmallow, thereby

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.310
losing the second.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.645
When the rewards were hidden,
however, when the kids

00:25:12.645 --> 00:25:15.520
couldn't see the marshmallows
and were brought into the room

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.310
and told you can either have one
marshmallow now, or if you

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.660
can wait long enough, you can
have two marshmallows.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:26.710
Kids waited, on average,
12 minutes.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:32.130
Then Mischel wondered what was
driving the capacity of the

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:38.660
children with hidden rewards to
sustain their self-control

00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:39.974
long enough.

00:25:39.974 --> 00:25:43.970
So the second condition he tried
was to take the kids who

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.237
were in the circumstance where
the rewards were hidden, and

00:25:47.237 --> 00:25:51.800
tell them to think really hard
about the reward, think really

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:54.030
hard about those marshmallows.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:57.636
The effect of thinking hard
about the marshmallows was

00:25:57.636 --> 00:26:00.892
that the performance dropped to
exactly the level that it

00:26:00.892 --> 00:26:03.380
had been in the case of
the kids for whom

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.365
the reward was visible.

00:26:04.365 --> 00:26:09.440
And in fact, thinking about the
reward in the visible case

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.390
made it no worse.

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:15.560
So the problem was that when you
thought about the reward,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.690
it became salient and resistance
became difficult.

00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.370
So, thought Mischel, what if
we try it the other way?

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:25.950
What if we take the kids for
whom the reward is visible and

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.885
ask them to think happy
thoughts about

00:26:27.885 --> 00:26:28.770
something else, right?

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:31.880
Look around the room, recite
the alphabet, tell yourself

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.440
the story about the three little
pigs, do something to

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.425
keep yourself distracted.

00:26:35.425 --> 00:26:39.410
And the result was that if the
kids thought distracting

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.835
thoughts, they acted exactly
as the kids in the hidden

00:26:42.835 --> 00:26:43.460
rewards situation.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.200
And it made no difference in the
hidden situation to think

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.250
distracting thoughts.

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:55.250
So the presence of the
temptation before your mind is

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.380
part of what makes the
temptation difficult to

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:03.390
resist. And indeed,
Mischel thought

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.260
about this more generally.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:10.310
He presented kids with either
a photograph or a real

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.620
marshmallow, it didn't matter
which, and asked them either

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.235
to pretend that it was real or
to think about tasting this,

00:27:18.235 --> 00:27:22.610
think about how excellent that
marshmallow is going to taste.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:27.330
And the delay which kids were
able to impose upon themselves

00:27:27.330 --> 00:27:30.340
averaged about six minutes.

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.690
Whereas when he had even a real
marshmallow before them,

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.430
and asked the kids to pretend
that it's imaginary or to

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:38.790
think about it abstractly,
think about the number of

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:41.770
marshmallows there are, think
about the letter that the word

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:48.890
marshmallow starts with, think
about the nature of a candy

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:49.880
store and how --

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.000
I mean, these are four-year-olds
--

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.020
think about the nature of a
candy store and how candy

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.900
stores work in an
abstract sense.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:28:01.370
Kids were able to regulate
themselves for 18 minutes.

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.840
So what was going on here?

00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.240
What ties together the cases
where we get very short

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.360
numbers: kids are only able to
last four minutes, then give

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.410
in to the temptation.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.610
And what ties together
the cases where

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:18.210
we get large numbers?

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:22.370
Mischel's hypothesis, and this
fits with the material that we

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:28.280
discussed on January 20th, is
that there are two systems of

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.020
processing rewards.

00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:35.520
There's a hot system which
acts on what Plato or

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.610
Aristotle would call appetite,
or perhaps spirit.

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:42.580
It acts on the basis
of passion.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.450
And when we think about things
with a vivid, emotional

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:50.980
attraction to them, that system
gets activated and

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:57.560
Plato's horses, Aristotle's
non-rational parts, system

00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:03.920
one, aliefs and all the
rest get going.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.400
That's the system that's active
when the rewards are

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.630
visible and there's
no instruction.

00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:13.233
When you're thinking vividly
about the rewards, the

00:29:13.233 --> 00:29:18.900
appetitive parts of soul are
brought on line, and

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:23.740
resistance to temptation
becomes difficult.

00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:29.260
By contrast, when kids are asked
to think abstractly or

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.190
to pretend that the marshmallow
is imaginary, a

00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:39.670
cool, rational system--a
system that is the one

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:43.970
involved in belief that is
Plato's charioteer, that is

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:48.190
the System Two of the dual
processing tradition--that is

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.900
the belief in the alief-belief
tradition--comes on line.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:56.930
And in the face of this cool
processing system, which gives

00:29:56.930 --> 00:30:02.460
us a sort of rational distance
from what we confront, all of

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:07.700
a sudden self-regulation
becomes possible.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:13.520
So Mischel's studies fit in
to a larger framework for

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:17.710
thinking about how to
overcome temptation.

00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:22.290
One which you'll not be
surprised to hear is

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.650
articulated, as is almost
everything that we're thinking

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:30.010
about in this course, in one
of the two great founding

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.730
narratives of the Western
literary tradition--in this

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.270
case, Homer's Odyssey.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:42.910
Odysseus, pictured here in
elegant, white tunic, is

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.400
trying to get home from
the Trojan War.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:50.790
He's trying to get back to his
wife who is waiting faithfully

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:54.910
for him at home, and it's
taking him about

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.810
20 years to do so.

00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:03.710
And along the way as he tries to
go home, he faces all sorts

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:08.820
of temptations which threaten
to divert him from his path.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.500
And the temptation that he
faces in this picture,

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:16.610
illustrated here in the form
of these beautiful flying

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:20.340
women who look, to me, a little
bit like dementors from

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:22.391
Harry Potter.

00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:25.610
He, however, finds them
enormously tempting.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:30.760
And he's trying to figure out
how to get the ship past the

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:35.860
sirens, whose songs threaten to
cause the ship to founder

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.602
upon the shoal, so that he
can get home to Penelope.

00:31:39.602 --> 00:31:45.382
And what he comes up with are
two different strategies.

00:31:45.382 --> 00:31:50.260
The first strategy he applies
to his sailors.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:53.410
You will see that around
the ears of each of

00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:56.420
them is cotton batting.

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:01.600
He blocks their ears so that
the apparent utility of the

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.860
sirens is reduced for them.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:10.080
Unable to hear their song, the
sailors are able to continue

00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.690
rowing the boat past their
source of temptation.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:20.710
What he does to himself, as
you can see, is he has

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:28.480
himself, at point A on the
Ainslie curve, lashed to the

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:36.810
mast. Because, like Mischel's
children and like Ainslie, he

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:43.020
recognizes that when the siren's
song is available to

00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:47.870
him directly, he will be in
that B state where the

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:51.639
smaller, sooner reward--like
turning off your alarm clock

00:32:51.639 --> 00:32:55.510
or eating that cupcake--looms
larger to him.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:33:01.929
So what Odysseus does is, he
ties himself to the mast. Even

00:33:01.929 --> 00:33:07.550
though the temptation of the
reward is evident to him, he

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:14.300
has rendered himself unable
to act on that temptation.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.540
And there is a tradition, in
the contemporary decision

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:22.530
theory literature, to use this
metaphor of Ulysses and the

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:25.090
sirens, Odysseus and the
sirens depending which

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.230
translation you use of the
name, to think about

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:31.044
strategies for self-regulation.

00:33:31.044 --> 00:33:34.940
And it turns out that it's
helpful, I think, to think

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.960
about these strategies as
falling into three categories.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:44.040
If you're trying to get past
a temptation that has the

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.372
structure that we've been
looking at in this class, of

00:33:46.372 --> 00:33:50.650
smaller, sooner reward that,
because of temporal

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:55.760
discounting, looms
disproportionately large in

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:59.260
your decision structure.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:04.920
One way to get around it is by
means of external constraints.

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.970
You can separate yourself from
the ability to act on the

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:08.540
temptation.

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:12.560
You can turn off the Internet on
your computer, you can use

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.250
one of those cell phone condoms,
you can render

00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:20.010
yourself unable to act on the
basis of that which is going

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.220
to distract you from
your path.

00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:24.940
You can put your alarm clock
all the way across the room

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.730
you can take the cupcakes out
of your house, you can put

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:30.570
your credit card in a glass
of water in the freezer.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.390
All of these are ways of
separating yourself from the

00:34:33.390 --> 00:34:35.548
ability to act on
the temptation.

00:34:35.548 --> 00:34:39.130
Or you can separate yourself
from the appeal of the

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.400
temptation in some way.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:45.480
You can reduce its subjective
utility to you by, for

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:51.950
example, blocking your ears so
you won't even notice that the

00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:54.230
temptation is there.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:59.190
So that's a way of externalizing
responsibility

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.642
for decision making
in this case.

00:35:01.642 --> 00:35:05.930
And it's an extraordinarily
effective way of

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.580
self-regulating.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.262
You are an agent in the world.

00:35:10.262 --> 00:35:12.922
The actions which you're
going to perform are

00:35:12.922 --> 00:35:14.150
actions on the world.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:17.710
And separating yourself from the
ability to perform those

00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:21.250
actions is one way to get
around temptation.

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:23.440
A second way to get around
temptation, which we've

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.240
discussed a lot in the last
two classes, is by direct

00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.345
appeal to the spirited or
appetitive parts of your soul.

00:35:31.345 --> 00:35:34.070
So you can manipulate incentive

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:36.440
structures for yourself.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:40.890
You can change the relative
utilities

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:42.270
of the various rewards.

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:45.300
You can subject yourself to
interpersonal pressures.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:47.950
Remember we put the smiley faces
on your computers so

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:51.170
that the gaze of the eyes of
others would help you stick to

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:52.280
your tasks.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.080
Or you can cultivate
habits, right?

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:57.750
You can get spirit and appetite
into line with reason

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:01.840
by cultivating natural ways
of responding to things.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.970
But the third way that you can
get around temptations, is the

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:09.600
one which we haven't discussed
yet, and that

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:13.142
is by means of reason.

00:36:13.142 --> 00:36:18.450
And it is in this light that
Nozick discusses the roles

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:22.850
that principles can play in
allowing us not to be

00:36:22.850 --> 00:36:24.492
incontinent.

00:36:24.492 --> 00:36:27.650
So Nozick points out, quite
generally, that what

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:32.240
principles do is they group
actions by putting them under

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.910
a general rubric so that linked
actions are viewed or

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.610
treated in the same way.

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:45.400
If one takes on as a principle
to be a vegetarian, then any

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:50.510
act of eating meat is seen as a
violation of that principle.

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:53.910
Even if one thinks there are
circumstances where eating

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:57.840
meat might be the right thing to
do, all things considered.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.500
What the principle does is to
classify that act with other

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:09.310
acts of eating meat so that the
actions become symbolic of

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.830
one another.

00:37:10.830 --> 00:37:15.510
Smoking a single cigarette isn't
so bad, but smoking lots

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:16.983
of cigarettes is.

00:37:16.983 --> 00:37:21.230
And one thing that a principle
can do is to let you have any

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:27.930
one instance stand as
an example of all.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:31.980
Principles, says Nozick,
constitute a way of binding

00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:35.110
ourselves to the mast, not
through external constraints

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:41.160
like ropes, but through internal
commitments to

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.781
following their mandates.

00:37:44.781 --> 00:37:47.630
And he points out that
principles are affected in a

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.390
wide range of cases.

00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:52.860
Intellectually, if you have
the idea that there's a

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:56.726
principle that connects one set
of facts to another, then

00:37:56.726 --> 00:38:00.380
the principle can transmit
probability or support.

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.920
The old cases came out
a particular way.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:09.160
Every time you observed a
certain kind of causation, it

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:11.440
had a particular structure.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:14.160
You identified a principle, and
you're now in a position

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:17.496
to make predictions
about new cases.

00:38:17.496 --> 00:38:21.200
Interpersonally, they
let you appear to

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.200
be a reliable person.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:26.970
Your past actions were of
a certain kind, right?

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:31.000
Every time I said I would give
you money, I gave you money.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.440
So you can conclude on that
basis I have a principle:

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.770
repay my debts.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:38.802
And on that basis, you predict
my future actions.

00:38:38.802 --> 00:38:43.560
It's in fact, exactly because
of that, that I switched all

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.190
the written exercises to
Thursdays rather than having

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.300
extensions on some of them.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:53.570
My thought was this: suppose I
had given extensions on two of

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:56.360
the essays from Tuesday
to Thursday?

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.260
I'd look unprincipled about the

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.050
regulations for this course.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.640
How will I be in a position
to enforce the course's

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:06.970
requirements if I appear
unprincipled?

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:11.060
Ah, suppose I adopt a new
principle, the Thursday due

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:15.740
date, with respect to which
I am unwavering?

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:17.960
Introspect a minute.

00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:22.860
Strangely, that seems more
authoritative than having most

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:26.670
of them due on Tuesdays
and some on Thursdays.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:29.480
Intrapersonally, conceptualizing
oneself in

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.760
terms of principles gives a kind
of narrative continuity

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.170
to one's life.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:40.160
My past self was the kind of
person who would never do X.

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:45.080
My past self is the kind of
person who always does Y.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.840
Articulating it in terms of a
principle lets me connect my

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.270
future self to my past self.

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:56.404
It gives me a sense of
continuity over time.

00:39:56.404 --> 00:40:02.770
And finally, intrapersonally,
principles provide ways of

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:05.180
overcoming temptation.

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:09.530
Ooh, every time I see a cupcake
I want to eat it, but

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:14.080
if I have a principle that I
don't eat dessert after 4:00

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.940
pm, then it's easy.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.435
I don't have to make
a decision on a

00:40:19.435 --> 00:40:21.440
case-by-case basis.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:23.700
The single act of eating
that cupcake once.

00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:25.010
Why that once?

00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:28.150
Why wouldn't I then do it all
the time becomes a way of

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:31.150
committing myself to
future actions.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:34.830
Those of you who practice an
instrument know that the

00:40:34.830 --> 00:40:40.510
easiest practice schedule is
to practice every day.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.780
Because if you practice every
day, there's no question of

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.640
whether this is one
of the days that

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.850
you're going to practice.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:52.520
If you are committed to a
certain kind of religious

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.750
behavior, or a certain kind of
dietary restriction, or a

00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:59.590
certain kind of exercise
regimen, the easiest way to

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:05.170
implement it is to say always,
with respect to this domain,

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.140
will I behave in those ways.

00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:11.730
And, in fact, Nozick suggests
that this is exactly the way

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:15.330
to use principles to get
past the Ainslie curve.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:18.040
The mark of a principle, he
says, is that it ties the

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:22.170
decision whether to do an
immediate particular act to a

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.480
whole class of actions
of which the

00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:25.370
principle makes it part.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:29.790
The act now stands for
the whole class.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.840
I discovered that I'm overusing
a particular kind of

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.180
relaxational substance
on weekends.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:40.080
And the most straightforward
way for me deal with that

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.260
situation is to put
a categorical

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.890
restriction on my behavior.

00:41:46.890 --> 00:41:51.180
Moreover, points out Nozick,
I can make use of a really

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:55.330
interesting irrationality
about myself to fight

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:58.540
irrationality with
irrationality.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.280
Remember, I pointed out to you
a few lectures ago, that

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.900
people who lose a $10 bill on
the way to the theater are

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:08.320
happy to buy a new ticket
when they get there.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:11.040
But people who lost a $10
ticket on the way to the

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.090
theatre are unhappy to do so.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.810
That's an instance of a general
phenomenon known as

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:20.300
sunk costs, that when we've
invested a lot of effort in

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.280
something, we're reluctant to
stop acting on its basis, even

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.887
if right then we don't prefer
to do it anymore.

00:42:27.887 --> 00:42:32.390
And so Nozick suggests that if
during A, that period leading

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:35.280
up to the Ainslie curve, we
invest many resources in the

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.652
future in pursuit of the larger
reward, the fact that

00:42:38.652 --> 00:42:42.410
we tend not to ignore sunk costs
provides us with a way

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:45.610
to get past the temptation
during the period, B, to

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.996
choose the smaller, sooner.

00:42:47.996 --> 00:42:52.190
If I decide I want to go to six
plays a year and I buy six

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:55.790
tickets, then even if it's
raining on one of the nights

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:59.900
that I was supposed to go, my
tendency towards sunk costs

00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:02.560
will help me act on my action.

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:04.270
All right, last two minutes.

00:43:04.270 --> 00:43:06.060
Let me connect this
to what we've done

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:07.810
and where we're going.

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:10.410
This, as you know, is the last
lecture in the first unit of

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:10.950
the course.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:15.040
We began this unit by reading
Dan Ariely's Predictably

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.510
Irrational popular chapter--and
we ended this

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:21.680
unit by reading Ariely's
Predictably Irrational popular

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.060
chapter on procrastination.

00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:28.940
But, unlike your experience on
January 11th, you now have a

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:33.360
philosophical framework in which
to place his discussion.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.280
Unlike on January 11th, you
now have a psychological

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.640
framework in which to place
his discussion.

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.620
You've read Haidt, you've read
Batson, you've read the dual

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.000
processing work, you've read
Milgram, and Shay, and

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.180
Stockdale and Kazdin.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:49.006
And you've read his own
scientific presentation of the

00:43:49.006 --> 00:43:53.470
case, and you've thought about
the connections between them.

00:43:53.470 --> 00:43:55.500
What comes next?

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.260
What comes next is a chance, in
your 5th and 6th directed

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:04.190
exercises, to address three
psychology articles which you,

00:44:04.190 --> 00:44:07.230
yourself, are going to choose
and summarize, and then come

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:10.120
up with an experiment
on the basis of.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.710
What comes next is a chance to
think about the philosophical

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:17.400
framework by writing your
first and second essays.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:20.230
And what comes at the end of the
course, and I'll preview

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:23.860
it now, is a chance to think
about the connections between

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.820
them in the context of your
final directed exercise.

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:32.490
Which is going to be to design
a week of the course yourself

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:36.590
in which you choose texts
that you think multiply

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:39.040
illuminate the topic.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:43.692
So next lecture we'll move on to
our discussion of morality.

00:44:43.692 --> 00:44:46.660
And I'll connect it back to some
of the issues we've been

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.220
talking about so far.

00:44:48.220 --> 00:44:51.680
And I look forward to seeing
you on Thursday, and

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:55.470
especially to giving away the
$6 to the very rational

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.994
student who was lucky
enough to earn it.

00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.620
Wow.
 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.509
So this is my last true
confession to you,

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.252
my class, and it's a true -- I
always give you true

00:00:11.252 --> 00:00:12.770
confessions.
 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.949
I never lie to you,
my class, but this is a truly

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.460
true confession because the fact
of the matter is,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.919
I actually really couldn't
figure out how to end the

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:23.530
course.
 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.378
[laughs]
I couldn't figure out what this

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:28.364
last lecture was supposed to be,
and I really wondered about it,

00:00:28.364 --> 00:00:29.360
agonized over it.
 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.340
It's the last lecture.
 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.420
There's all this pressure.
 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.216
Several of you have e-mailed me
and said, "Looking forward

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:36.480
to the last lecture."
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.740
[laughs]
How can I live up to the

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.730
expectation?
 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.760
So I decided that I would do
two things in the lecture,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.010
and the first thing that I'm
going to do is talk about the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.264
end of the American Revolution,
which is not an easy thing to

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:55.803
do, and I'm not going to be so
good as to actually put my

00:00:55.803 --> 00:00:58.070
finger on the moment when the
Revolution ends,

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.265
but I'm at least going to
suggest a couple things about

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:00.548
that.
 

00:01:00.548 --> 00:01:03.362
And then at the end you'll see
I'm going to come back around

00:01:03.362 --> 00:01:06.412
and hopefully magically just tie
the whole course together by the

00:01:06.412 --> 00:01:07.510
end of the lecture.
 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.805
You will for sure notice that
some of the things I'm talking

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:12.140
about now have references to
things I talked about way at the

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.230
beginning of the course.
 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.450
So I'm trying for symmetry --
course symmetry.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.031
And if you think back in the
distant ages of time when this

00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.349
course started I talked on that
first --

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:26.688
I think the very first lecture
-- I did --

00:01:26.688 --> 00:01:30.985
I used a quote from John Adams
and I used a quote from Benjamin

00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:31.470
Rush.
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.790
Those are the quotes that are
on the top of the syllabus.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.034
And both of them talk about
when the Revolution supposedly

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:39.629
began.
 

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:42.745
So Adams, writing in 1815,
said that he thought the

00:01:42.745 --> 00:01:46.050
Revolution began "in the
Minds of the People,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.300
and this was effected,
from 1760 to 1775,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.855
in the course of fifteen Years
before a drop of blood was drawn

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:55.060
at Lexington."
 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.349
So he says the war,
quote, "was no part of the

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:58.220
Revolution."
 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.250
And then the other quote I read
was Rush,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.326
who in 1776 basically agreed
that the war and the Revolution

00:02:04.326 --> 00:02:07.299
were two different things but
then says,

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.781
"The American War is over:
but this is far from being the

00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:11.490
case with the American
Revolution."

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.968
"We have changed our forms
of government,

00:02:12.968 --> 00:02:16.508
but it remains to effect a
revolution in our principles,

00:02:16.508 --> 00:02:19.494
opinions, and manners,
so as to accommodate them to

00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:22.360
the forms of government we have
adopted."

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.738
Okay.
 

00:02:22.738 --> 00:02:27.348
So when I quoted those at the
very beginning of the course,

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:30.432
I basically was quoting them to
kind of shake up your

00:02:30.432 --> 00:02:33.634
assumptions about what the
American Revolution actually

00:02:33.634 --> 00:02:34.110
was.
 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.849
If the Founders can't even
agree, that kind of opens things

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.780
broadly for us to really talk
about what the Revolution was.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.770
Today I'm mentioning them
because I actually do want us to

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.510
think a little bit about,
if that -- if there's all that

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.590
confusion about when it starts,
what can we say about when a

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:49.610
Revolution ends?
 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.878
And there's definitely a hint
about how to discuss that

00:02:52.878 --> 00:02:55.060
question in both of those
quotes,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.220
even though they don't
necessarily agree,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.818
because both men in one way or
another saw the revolution as

00:03:00.818 --> 00:03:04.658
being fundamentally about what
Rush called "principles,

00:03:04.658 --> 00:03:07.106
opinions and manners"
and Adams called a "change

00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:08.610
in the minds of the
people."

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.471
So in a way they're both saying
that a real Revolution,

00:03:12.471 --> 00:03:15.402
a full revolution,
involves some kind of a

00:03:15.402 --> 00:03:18.050
fundamental change in
principles.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.254
And, as both men suggest,
obviously this isn't something

00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:24.284
that happens instantly like a
declaration of war or a

00:03:24.284 --> 00:03:28.045
surrender on a battlefield,
that it's a process and it

00:03:28.045 --> 00:03:31.729
takes place over years,
maybe even over decades.

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:36.479
Now obviously if you think
about what a revolution is,

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:40.334
formally speaking,
it's a change of forms of

00:03:40.334 --> 00:03:43.830
government more than anything
else.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.335
So it involves some kind of a
large-scale transfer of power

00:03:47.335 --> 00:03:50.780
after some kind of a struggle
between competing groups.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.192
Right?
 

00:03:51.192 --> 00:03:54.699
So it's a major shift in
sovereignty of some kind.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.041
But for the struggle and the
instability of the Revolution to

00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:00.979
come to a close,
obviously there had to be some

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.926
kind of a shared agreement about
the nature of whatever this new

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:08.010
regime was going to be,
about what its ideals were,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.968
about what its shape was going
to be.

00:04:09.968 --> 00:04:14.098
And without that kind of shared
agreement on those kinds of

00:04:14.098 --> 00:04:16.649
things,
this new regime would really

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.526
stay in a state of flux and
would be vulnerable to all kinds

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:23.810
of continued dramatic and
potentially revolutionary

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:24.600
change.
 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.968
So in a sense,
what I'm saying here is that

00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:31.336
revolutions involve both
deconstruction and

00:04:31.336 --> 00:04:35.238
reconstruction,
and that basically it's one

00:04:35.238 --> 00:04:38.220
thing to rebel against
something,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.586
and it's quite another thing to
construct something in its place

00:04:42.586 --> 00:04:46.329
that manages to get some kind of
general acceptance.

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:50.709
And a revolution can't be said
to have ended until both parts

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:53.120
of that equation have been met.
 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.910
And I think if you think back
over the course of the semester,

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.822
you can see that during the
semester we've looked at both

00:05:00.822 --> 00:05:03.709
parts of that equation,
in a sense.

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:05.689
We've looked,
at the very beginning of the

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.730
course when we were getting
toward the beginning of the war,

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.916
we've seen how Americans
generally agreed about what they

00:05:11.916 --> 00:05:14.319
protesting against,
but the 1770s,

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:19.088
1780s, 1790s revealed they
weren't necessarily in agreement

00:05:19.088 --> 00:05:22.129
about what they were fighting
for;

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.521
they didn't necessarily agree
about what the most desirable

00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:27.959
outcome would be.
 

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:30.439
And we've watched this over the
course of the semester.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.529
We've seen people basically
just figuring out what this new

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:34.810
regime is going to be.
 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.303
So, we looked at the 1770s,
we saw how people tried to

00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:42.454
create constitutions that would
reflect whatever this new regime

00:05:42.454 --> 00:05:45.644
was going to be,
and we saw how those

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:50.699
constitutions pretty much
distrusted centralized power.

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.173
Unfortunately,
the 1780s revealed that that

00:05:54.173 --> 00:05:57.730
first wave of reform wasn't
quite right,

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.047
that there were some pretty
important problems that weren't

00:06:01.047 --> 00:06:02.817
solved,
that there were some new

00:06:02.817 --> 00:06:05.661
problems that seemed to be
erupting that maybe hadn't been

00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:08.278
anticipated before,
and then we've seen the result.

00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:11.596
We've watched Continental Army
officers sort of vaguely

00:06:11.596 --> 00:06:15.033
threatening some kind of coup
and saw the mighty power of

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:17.000
George Washington's glasses.
 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.620
We saw soldiers sticking their
bayonets through the windows of

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.946
the Pennsylvania state house to
demand their pay from the

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:25.550
Confederation Congress.
 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.642
We saw indebted farmers in
Massachusetts joining in protest

00:06:29.642 --> 00:06:32.838
to close down the courts,
and then of course we saw the

00:06:32.838 --> 00:06:34.940
Independent Republic of Vermont
and my favorite,

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.889
the State of Franklin.
 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:40.639
So clearly there was some
pretty widespread discontent,

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.346
and some of the elite also,
as we heard,

00:06:43.346 --> 00:06:45.569
were not particularly happy.
 

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.509
Many of them wanted some kind
of economic stability.

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.791
Some of them were none too
pleased about what they saw as

00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:55.430
this sort of widespread social
instability.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.531
So in one way or another,
all of these groups felt that

00:06:58.531 --> 00:07:02.149
the promise of the Revolution
wasn't really being fulfilled,

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:05.670
and the political system that
had been put into place during

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.014
the Revolution not only was
incapable of dealing with the

00:07:09.014 --> 00:07:11.903
problem,
but in many ways it was fueling

00:07:11.903 --> 00:07:12.790
the problem.
 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.091
Now of course everything in one
way or another added up to lead

00:07:17.091 --> 00:07:20.910
to the Constitutional
Convention, which we discussed.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:24.795
And as we discussed in the
course, a new Constitution was

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:28.024
by no means a done deal,
and in fact there was some

00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:30.944
pretty fervent debate over
whether or not some individual

00:07:30.944 --> 00:07:33.290
states even wanted to
participate in the whole

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.490
Convention at all.
 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.548
And we've seen some of what
people were scared of in those

00:07:37.548 --> 00:07:40.500
debates about whether or not to
go to the Convention.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.983
A stronger government or even
just a new government might open

00:07:43.983 --> 00:07:47.069
the door to things like an
established aristocracy,

00:07:47.069 --> 00:07:51.579
monarchy, tyrannical
centralized power,

00:07:51.579 --> 00:07:55.740
the rise of a privileged few
over an impoverished many.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.194
So in essence,
these people are seeing that

00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:00.588
there might be a big change
happening,

00:08:00.588 --> 00:08:02.709
they don't know what the change
is going to be,

00:08:02.709 --> 00:08:05.930
and anything seems possible,
and all of those things

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:09.843
obviously would represent going
back on what the Revolution had

00:08:09.843 --> 00:08:11.360
just gone forth for.
 

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.423
So in essence,
you see people who had

00:08:14.423 --> 00:08:19.528
absolutely no sense of political
stability or permanence,

00:08:19.528 --> 00:08:21.740
no sense of what was going to
come,

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.709
no real consensus about the
best way to fix things.

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:28.982
Now following the 1780s came a
period that obviously we don't

00:08:28.982 --> 00:08:30.620
cover in this course.
 

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.090
My other lecture course covers
it, and that's the 1790s,

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.317
which saw yet another wave of
reform and this time it has to

00:08:37.317 --> 00:08:39.668
do with the rise of the
Federalist party.

00:08:39.668 --> 00:08:43.202
And the Federalists in one way
or another were largely about

00:08:43.202 --> 00:08:46.642
centralizing power even more,
and strengthening the national

00:08:46.642 --> 00:08:49.673
government even more,
and controlling and channeling

00:08:49.673 --> 00:08:52.529
the protests and politicking of
the populace;

00:08:52.529 --> 00:08:55.381
they're not all that
comfortable with ongoing popular

00:08:55.381 --> 00:08:56.149
politicking.
 

00:08:56.149 --> 00:09:00.325
And here again,
in the 1790s with this sort of

00:09:00.325 --> 00:09:03.557
counter-wave,
you also see more instability,

00:09:03.557 --> 00:09:07.056
more of a sense that there's
some kind of potentially drastic

00:09:07.056 --> 00:09:10.379
change that might be happening
just around the corner.

00:09:10.379 --> 00:09:13.578
So throughout the 1790s,
people have things in their

00:09:13.578 --> 00:09:15.390
letters,
throwaway lines like:

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:17.899
'If this government lasts
another five years,

00:09:17.899 --> 00:09:19.480
here's what I think we should
do.'

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:25.278
You can almost feel in some of
these letters how frightened,

00:09:25.278 --> 00:09:28.317
in a sense, some of these
people were who were stepping

00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:31.129
onto the stage of a new
government in this sense of

00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:32.480
amazing instability.
 

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.171
I'm going to offer three quotes
because it's amazing to me how

00:09:35.171 --> 00:09:36.009
similar they are.
 

00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:37.370
They all use the same image.
 

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.138
It's almost like they went into
a room and said,

00:09:39.138 --> 00:09:40.870
'How shall we describe being
scared in 1789?

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.139
Oh, I know.'
 

00:09:42.139 --> 00:09:45.668
So James Madison says in 1789,
" We are in a wilderness

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:48.418
without a single footstep to
guide us."

00:09:48.418 --> 00:09:50.892
George Washington in 1790:
"I walk on untrodden

00:09:50.892 --> 00:09:51.620
ground."
 

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.350
And good old Pennsylvania
senator William Maclay,

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.500
who offered us that quote way
at the beginning of the course,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.101
sitting next to Virginians at
dinner and saying that all they

00:10:00.101 --> 00:10:01.750
talked about was alcohol and
horses.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.750
Maclay says,
"The whole world is a

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.700
shell, and we tread on hollow
ground every step."

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.480
Now that's kind of interesting
to me,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.460
that all of those quotes are
all saying the same thing,

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.678
which is basically all of these
guys literally are saying,

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:13.969
'Wow.
 

00:10:13.969 --> 00:10:17.331
I'm on this really unstable
ground and I have no idea where

00:10:17.331 --> 00:10:21.038
I'm supposed to be going or what
a safe path is going to be.'

00:10:21.038 --> 00:10:25.110
So throughout the 1790s,
the Federalists countered their

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:28.808
sense of social disorder by
trying to legislate and

00:10:28.808 --> 00:10:32.509
administrate their way into
order and control.

00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:35.597
And the Alien and Sedition Acts
of 1798, which I'm sure you

00:10:35.597 --> 00:10:38.739
probably studied in high school,
are two of the most extreme

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:40.389
examples along those lines.
 

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:44.583
This brings us to Thomas
Jefferson and the presidential

00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:46.058
election of 1800.
 

00:10:46.058 --> 00:10:48.788
Now significantly,
for the purposes of this class,

00:10:48.788 --> 00:10:52.283
Jefferson years later,
very modestly called his own

00:10:52.283 --> 00:10:56.150
election to the Presidency,
quote, "the Revolution of

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.860
1800."
 

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.691
Right, not modest at all:
'ah, yes, when I came to power

00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:01.389
it was the Revolution of 1800.'
 

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:04.759
And not only that -- he said it
was "as real a revolution

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:07.744
in the principles of our
government as that of 1776 was

00:11:07.744 --> 00:11:08.960
in its form."
 

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.164
Okay.
 

00:11:09.164 --> 00:11:10.519
He's talking serious
revolution;

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:15.620
'my rise to power was just as
significant as 1776.'

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:16.990
Thank you, Thomas Jefferson.
 

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.971
But you can kind of see that,
given what was happening in the

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:21.754
1790s --
in my amazingly quick and

00:11:21.754 --> 00:11:24.940
dirty, frighteningly condensed
version of the 1790s that I just

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.823
gave you --
given what the Federalists

00:11:26.823 --> 00:11:29.217
seemed to represent,
you could see why Jefferson

00:11:29.217 --> 00:11:32.504
would have thought that his rise
to the Presidency was some kind

00:11:32.504 --> 00:11:36.490
of a return to core principles,
or Revolutionary principles.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.590
Now this change of principles
wasn't easy,

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:44.953
and actually I think it was the
whole intensity of the

00:11:44.953 --> 00:11:49.015
experience of that 1800 election
that led Jefferson to experience

00:11:49.015 --> 00:11:52.825
and describe his election as a
revolution that was fought and

00:11:52.825 --> 00:11:53.460
won.
 

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:57.202
His rise to the Presidency came
after a seemingly deadlocked tie

00:11:57.202 --> 00:12:00.708
vote in the Electoral College
that was thrown into the House

00:12:00.708 --> 00:12:02.668
of Representatives to decide.
 

00:12:02.668 --> 00:12:06.822
So deadlocked was the election
and so extreme were the fears

00:12:06.822 --> 00:12:11.115
and expectations on all sides
that if the wrong person got the

00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:13.501
office,
the entire nation would come

00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:15.982
crashing to ruin,
that two states -- in two

00:12:15.982 --> 00:12:18.879
different states --
and in one state I believe the

00:12:18.879 --> 00:12:21.916
governor was in on it --
people were stockpiling arms

00:12:21.916 --> 00:12:25.182
because they were going to march
on Washington and take the

00:12:25.182 --> 00:12:26.759
government for Jefferson.
 

00:12:26.759 --> 00:12:28.379
That's amazing.
 

00:12:28.379 --> 00:12:30.947
That's America,
in a sense, on the brink of

00:12:30.947 --> 00:12:34.143
some sort of civil war --
if the people are marching on

00:12:34.143 --> 00:12:37.388
the government to take it for
the person who they think should

00:12:37.388 --> 00:12:38.240
be President.
 

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.720
Massachusetts Federalist Fisher
Ames, at that time,

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:50.514
thought about this and believed
that he understood why this was

00:12:50.514 --> 00:12:52.048
happening.
 

00:12:52.048 --> 00:12:54.030
And I'll mention here only
because it's been a continuing

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.801
theme in our course:
we've seen lots of crying guys

00:12:55.801 --> 00:12:56.580
over the semester.
 

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.787
Washington's really good at
reducing people to tears

00:12:58.787 --> 00:12:59.350
apparently.
 

00:12:59.350 --> 00:13:01.784
And I have to mention here --
partly because I just really

00:13:01.784 --> 00:13:03.914
like Fisher Ames,
because he's sort of an

00:13:03.914 --> 00:13:06.908
intriguing character who always
says quotable things.

00:13:06.908 --> 00:13:10.388
But he also -- he was in
Congress in the 1790s and the

00:13:10.388 --> 00:13:14.260
thing that he's most known for
is he made a speech about the

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:17.149
Jay Treaty and everybody started
to cry.

00:13:17.149 --> 00:13:21.160
So he reduced Congress to
tears, which to me is kind of a

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.740
terrifying image,
Congress crying.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.772
So Fisher Ames,
mighty orator,

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:28.759
reducer to tears.
 

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:31.553
Here's what he says in 1800,
when he's looking around and

00:13:31.553 --> 00:13:33.950
he's trying to figure out what
this all means.

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.460
"The fact really is,
that ...

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:39.220
there is a want of accordance
between our system of government

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.940
and the state of our public
opinion.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:46.072
The government is republican;
opinion is essentially

00:13:46.072 --> 00:13:47.500
democratic....
 

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.494
Either, events will raise
public opinion high enough to

00:13:50.494 --> 00:13:53.265
support our government,
or public opinion will pull

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:55.539
down the government to its own
level.

00:13:55.539 --> 00:13:57.250
They must equalize."
 

00:13:57.250 --> 00:13:59.350
That's really interesting.
 

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:02.509
So here, watching what's
happening in 1800,

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:07.240
Ames is kind of confirming what
Adams and Rush were suggesting

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:11.038
in the quotes that I started out
by discussing.

00:14:11.038 --> 00:14:14.288
For a revolution to end,
forms and public opinion have

00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:16.923
to equalize in some way,
and before they do,

00:14:16.923 --> 00:14:18.580
things remain unstable.
 

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:21.048
So in a way,
what all of these guys are

00:14:21.048 --> 00:14:23.868
saying,
is that revolutions end when

00:14:23.868 --> 00:14:28.437
public opinion conforms with new
post-revolutionary forms of

00:14:28.437 --> 00:14:31.193
governance,
and until that happens,

00:14:31.193 --> 00:14:34.590
revolutionary change is still
entirely possible.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.629
Once that happens,
once the sort of new car smell

00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:41.051
has dissipated from a new
government and the government

00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:44.979
can be taken for granted as kind
of the normal state of affairs

00:14:44.979 --> 00:14:49.168
and it's endorsed by a majority,
then it becomes much harder to

00:14:49.168 --> 00:14:52.548
stage some kind of full-scale
revolution from outside of the

00:14:52.548 --> 00:14:53.350
government.
 

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.535
So in essence,
revolutions end when the public

00:14:56.535 --> 00:15:00.129
mind declares that they do;
it's up to the public.

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:03.388
Now that's a nice,
big, broad general discussion

00:15:03.388 --> 00:15:06.993
about defining the bounds of the
American Revolution,

00:15:06.993 --> 00:15:09.418
but what does that really mean?
 

00:15:09.418 --> 00:15:13.139
What are we really saying here
and how could we show it?

00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:17.754
How do you actually show public
opinion changing and eventually

00:15:17.754 --> 00:15:20.360
conforming with a new
government?

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.562
Well, one way that you can
begin to do this is to find a

00:15:23.562 --> 00:15:27.114
wonderful primary source that
includes all kinds of eyewitness

00:15:27.114 --> 00:15:30.548
testimony about one person's
ideas and how they changed over

00:15:30.548 --> 00:15:31.190
time.
 

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:35.144
So I bring to you today the
recorded recollections of George

00:15:35.144 --> 00:15:38.428
Robert Twelves Hughes,
a New England shoemaker.

00:15:38.428 --> 00:15:41.009
I know he's popped up once or
twice in one or two of the books

00:15:41.009 --> 00:15:41.558
we've read.
 

00:15:41.558 --> 00:15:44.267
And he's popped up once or
twice for good reason,

00:15:44.267 --> 00:15:47.255
because it's hard -- it's
harder to find comments from

00:15:47.255 --> 00:15:49.399
people who are not lofty
Founders.

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:53.221
It's hard to find recollections
and memories and thoughts about

00:15:53.221 --> 00:15:57.288
the Revolution in a broad sense
from average Americans because,

00:15:57.288 --> 00:15:59.849
number one, they don't spend a
lot of time often sitting down

00:15:59.849 --> 00:16:01.711
and musing on paper,
and number two,

00:16:01.711 --> 00:16:05.293
their papers don't get saved as
often as an elite politician's

00:16:05.293 --> 00:16:06.470
papers get saved.
 

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.645
So people always quote George
Robert Twelves Hughes because

00:16:09.645 --> 00:16:12.876
he's there and he's thoughtful
and he actually went back and

00:16:12.876 --> 00:16:16.547
talked about his entire life,
and his life spans this entire

00:16:16.547 --> 00:16:17.029
period.
 

00:16:17.029 --> 00:16:18.610
He was born in 1742.
 

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:22.690
He dies in 1840,
so he lives a really long time.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:26.712
And he ended up being one of
the last surviving veterans of

00:16:26.712 --> 00:16:29.696
the Revolution,
or at least that people knew

00:16:29.696 --> 00:16:30.389
about.
 

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:32.393
So because of that,
in the 1830s,

00:16:32.393 --> 00:16:35.460
he was interviewed so that he
could talk about his

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.738
recollections,
things of his life that he saw

00:16:38.738 --> 00:16:40.269
as being significant.
 

00:16:40.269 --> 00:16:44.820
So let's look for a minute at
what Hughes can show us.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.335
For one thing,
you can see in some of the

00:16:47.335 --> 00:16:51.297
stories that he told and the way
that he tells them some kind of

00:16:51.297 --> 00:16:54.567
subtle but actually pretty
significant changes in the

00:16:54.567 --> 00:16:58.090
public mind that were unleashed
by the Revolution.

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.217
So for example,
one of Hughes's earliest

00:17:00.217 --> 00:17:03.820
memories was of having to bring
a pair of shoes to John Hancock.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.420
And as he recalled the occasion
all these years later,

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.890
he was terrified,
and he says he's first ushered

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.730
into the kitchen where his type
of person belongs --

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.598
and then Hancock says, 'No, no.
 

00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:16.534
Actually, I'd like to thank
this guy personally,' so then

00:17:16.534 --> 00:17:19.573
he's ushered into the sitting
room, and he mumbles a little

00:17:19.573 --> 00:17:20.150
speech.
 

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.766
He didn't quite know what he
was supposed to say or how to

00:17:21.766 --> 00:17:23.405
say it,
and he's really embarrassed,

00:17:23.405 --> 00:17:25.829
and then Hancock actually asked
him to sit down,

00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:27.259
which terrifies him even more.
 

00:17:27.259 --> 00:17:29.150
And then worst of all,
Hancock says,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.759
'Let me drink to your health'
-- and wants to do the whole

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.402
glass-clinking thing,
and Hughes said,

00:17:33.402 --> 00:17:34.858
'I've never done the
glass-clinking thing.

00:17:34.858 --> 00:17:36.480
[laughs]
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.730
We did the glass-clinking
thing.'

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.036
And then he basically ran away
as soon as he could without

00:17:41.036 --> 00:17:41.788
being rude.
 

00:17:41.788 --> 00:17:45.211
Now, Hughes's memory of this
whole episode,

00:17:45.211 --> 00:17:50.020
even all of these years later,
shows really sort of colonial

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.140
era deference at work.
 

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:52.465
Right?
 

00:17:52.465 --> 00:17:55.680
This is not someone who's just
respectful of John Hancock.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.881
This is someone who's scared of
interacting with someone who's

00:17:59.881 --> 00:18:01.808
that above him in society.
 

00:18:01.808 --> 00:18:05.900
Now Hughes lived in Boston in
the 1760s and 1770s.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.858
This is very handy for us
obviously,

00:18:07.858 --> 00:18:11.068
because then he offers us
eyewitness testimony about other

00:18:11.068 --> 00:18:13.546
kinds of sort of
floating-in-the-air opinions

00:18:13.546 --> 00:18:15.630
that were developing at the
time.

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.775
So he -- certainly,
you can see when he's talking

00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:22.575
about his experiences -- shared
the feelings of many of his

00:18:22.575 --> 00:18:25.000
neighbors in Boston in the
1770s.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.972
In his later years,
he remembered how much he

00:18:27.972 --> 00:18:31.486
really hated the British
soldiers that were occupying

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:32.230
Boston.
 

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:34.797
He actually remembered that one
of them had a pair of shoes made

00:18:34.797 --> 00:18:36.997
and then never paid for them,
so it's a really specific

00:18:36.997 --> 00:18:38.220
I-hate-the-British memory.
 

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:41.525
He also remembers watching an
eighteenth-century mugging in

00:18:41.525 --> 00:18:44.886
which a soldier knocked a lady
down and stole her bonnet and

00:18:44.886 --> 00:18:45.970
stole her muff.
 

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:48.708
So he remembers
ugly-British-soldier moments

00:18:48.708 --> 00:18:49.598
from Boston.
 

00:18:49.598 --> 00:18:52.115
And then on March 5,
he says that when he heard

00:18:52.115 --> 00:18:55.180
noise in the street he ran to
see what was happening,

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.400
and he saw British soldiers
firing on American civilians,

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.828
and his response really says
something,

00:19:00.828 --> 00:19:04.009
because he immediately ran home
to arm himself.

00:19:04.009 --> 00:19:07.450
He grabbed a cane and he ran
back to the uproar,

00:19:07.450 --> 00:19:10.380
and when a soldier tried to
grab the cane out of his hands,

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.348
Hughes insisted that he had a
right to carry whatever he

00:19:13.348 --> 00:19:13.890
pleased.
 

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.380
Now that's really interesting,
because here you see Hughes --

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:19.923
He's defending his fellow
Bostonians literally and

00:19:19.923 --> 00:19:21.881
physically,
and he's clearly -- I suppose

00:19:21.881 --> 00:19:24.430
in insisting that he has a right
to hold on to that cane --

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.190
defending his rights too.
 

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.634
But what you see is that he's
taken action almost

00:19:28.634 --> 00:19:29.450
instinctively.
 

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:31.474
It's not like he saw what was
happening and said,

00:19:31.474 --> 00:19:32.910
'This is a Revolutionary
moment.

00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:35.539
I must go home and grab my club
so that I can say I was there at

00:19:35.539 --> 00:19:37.670
the beginning phases of the
American Revolution.'

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:40.108
He just sees what's happening
in the street,

00:19:40.108 --> 00:19:43.637
he's upset, it's his neighbors,
it's people from Boston who are

00:19:43.637 --> 00:19:46.799
getting shot at,
and he instinctively is just

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:49.029
drawn in to what's happening.
 

00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:52.391
So clearly, his sense of
involvement in unfolding events

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:55.996
is growing, particularly given
that he next took part in the

00:19:55.996 --> 00:19:57.279
Boston Tea Party.
 

00:19:57.279 --> 00:20:00.191
Obviously, that's a very
deliberate choice to take part

00:20:00.191 --> 00:20:01.000
in a protest.
 

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.703
And then he fights as a soldier
during the Revolution,

00:20:03.703 --> 00:20:06.510
which I guess is the ultimate
way in which you show that

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:07.890
you're part of a cause.
 

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.380
And then he went back to being
a shoemaker, and then he became

00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:13.440
an aged veteran of the
Revolution.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.940
Oh -- and one thing I can't
help mentioning,

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.152
only because whenever I talk
about George Robert Twelves

00:20:18.152 --> 00:20:21.009
Hughes I always mention this,
because I just love the fact

00:20:21.009 --> 00:20:22.410
that it exists:
He had,

00:20:22.410 --> 00:20:24.202
I think -- Well,
actually I know,

00:20:24.202 --> 00:20:25.660
he had fifteen children.
 

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.962
But what's wonderful about that
fact is that his eleventh son

00:20:29.962 --> 00:20:34.122
was named Eleven [laughter]
and his fifteenth son was named

00:20:34.122 --> 00:20:37.348
Fifteen [laughs]
and I just love the guy.

00:20:37.348 --> 00:20:40.710
George Robert Twelves Hughes
has the humor.

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.823
I don't know if his sons were
really thrilled about being

00:20:42.823 --> 00:20:44.313
named Eleven and Fifteen,
[laughter]

00:20:44.313 --> 00:20:46.782
but I just love the fact that
he did that and that we know

00:20:46.782 --> 00:20:47.130
that.
 

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:48.990
That makes me even happier.
 

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.347
Okay.
 

00:20:49.347 --> 00:20:53.221
So what does Hughes show us
besides very bizarre naming

00:20:53.221 --> 00:20:53.940
habits?
 

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.473
For one thing,
his recollections offer a great

00:20:56.473 --> 00:20:59.797
example of the ways in which the
Revolution inspired average

00:20:59.797 --> 00:21:02.220
Americans to become politically
active.

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.980
He was literally drawn into the
action,

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.460
first defending his neighbors
and his town,

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:11.271
but over time obviously feeling
like he was taking part in some

00:21:11.271 --> 00:21:12.808
kind of a larger cause.
 

00:21:12.808 --> 00:21:14.738
So in essence,
he helps us see how the

00:21:14.738 --> 00:21:16.720
Revolution could politicize
someone.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.788
And you kind of see this in
action.

00:21:18.788 --> 00:21:22.461
Obviously, with the Hancock
story, you can see what a real

00:21:22.461 --> 00:21:25.618
sense of pre-revolutionary
deference felt like.

00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:28.069
Now of course,
the Revolution didn't just

00:21:28.069 --> 00:21:31.512
stamp out deference,
but a politicized public was a

00:21:31.512 --> 00:21:35.442
public that understood that it
had rights and that it could

00:21:35.442 --> 00:21:36.460
demand them.
 

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.489
And eventually,
the American people would not

00:21:39.489 --> 00:21:43.481
show that kind of fear and
trembling before a member of the

00:21:43.481 --> 00:21:45.801
supposed elite,
so basically,

00:21:45.801 --> 00:21:49.788
eventually the American public
would find their voice.

00:21:49.788 --> 00:21:53.592
And this idea that the public
had a voice and had a right to

00:21:53.592 --> 00:21:56.878
express it is the sort of
general changing of public

00:21:56.878 --> 00:22:00.809
opinion that would ultimately
connect to the nation's new form

00:22:00.809 --> 00:22:02.098
of government.
 

00:22:02.098 --> 00:22:03.761
So basically,
you see the sort of beginning

00:22:03.761 --> 00:22:06.175
of a chain reaction that might
actually lead to the end of the

00:22:06.175 --> 00:22:06.769
Revolution.
 

00:22:06.769 --> 00:22:10.386
You can see patterns unfolding
that represent pretty major

00:22:10.386 --> 00:22:12.798
changes over a long stretch of
time.

00:22:12.798 --> 00:22:15.430
Now obviously,
it's not just average American

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:18.420
citizens who are being shaped by
the Revolution.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:21.390
The elite were profoundly
affected by it as well.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:24.328
And for one obvious thing --
suddenly,

00:22:24.328 --> 00:22:27.738
they were presented with this
opportunity to create and shape

00:22:27.738 --> 00:22:29.838
a new government for a new
nation,

00:22:29.838 --> 00:22:33.558
and they knew that this was a
pretty rare opportunity.

00:22:33.558 --> 00:22:36.444
So even as they're doing it,
they know that this is not

00:22:36.444 --> 00:22:38.368
something that happens very
often.

00:22:38.368 --> 00:22:41.285
Just listen to how John Adams
discussed what he felt like was

00:22:41.285 --> 00:22:44.250
the change that he experienced
over the course of his life.

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.130
And this is in one of the
letters --

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.558
I mentioned this at the
beginning of the course --

00:22:47.558 --> 00:22:49.890
these great letters they write
to each other in their old age.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.730
So here, writing to Jefferson,
Adams says,

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:55.509
"When I was young,
the Summum Bonum--

00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:57.868
or the sort of ultimate
height--in Massachusetts,

00:22:57.868 --> 00:23:00.630
was to be worth ten thousand
pounds Sterling,

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:03.980
ride in a Chariot--a carriage,
be Colonel of a Regiment of

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:06.980
Militia and hold a seat in His
Majesty's Council.

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:11.135
No Mans Imagination aspired to
any thing higher beneath the

00:23:11.135 --> 00:23:12.140
Skies."
 

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.414
So Adams is thinking back,
and he's here basically

00:23:15.414 --> 00:23:19.425
suggesting that the Revolution
and its aftermath expanded the

00:23:19.425 --> 00:23:21.900
horizons of an entire
generation.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.757
Now, he's talking about the
elite, but you could expand this

00:23:25.757 --> 00:23:28.700
to include the American
citizenry as well,

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.108
because in a variety of ways
the Revolution shook things up,

00:23:32.108 --> 00:23:35.480
and in doing so it expanded
people's horizons.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.303
Now I use the word
"citizenry"

00:23:37.303 --> 00:23:38.743
--
and I did that really

00:23:38.743 --> 00:23:42.093
deliberately,
because all Americans did not

00:23:42.093 --> 00:23:47.170
have their horizons expanded
during the Revolutionary war,

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.824
and this is something clearly
we talked about in class and

00:23:49.824 --> 00:23:52.525
we've talked about in sections
that's linked to some of the

00:23:52.525 --> 00:23:55.086
discussions that we've been
having about how radical the

00:23:55.086 --> 00:23:56.529
Revolution was or wasn't.
 

00:23:56.529 --> 00:23:58.470
So the elite,
like everyone else,

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.259
were profoundly affected by the
Revolution,

00:24:01.259 --> 00:24:04.082
but of course they're not the
people who get to decide the

00:24:04.082 --> 00:24:05.318
fate of the Revolution.
 

00:24:05.318 --> 00:24:09.048
It's the American public who
gets to make that decision.

00:24:09.048 --> 00:24:12.634
It's their opinions of the new
government that are going to

00:24:12.634 --> 00:24:16.160
either make or break the
government and the Revolution.

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.385
And during the period covered
by this course we've seen the

00:24:19.385 --> 00:24:22.390
beginnings of a long period
during which public opinion

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.686
would continue to change,
sometimes really dramatically,

00:24:25.686 --> 00:24:28.885
concerning just what this new
government and this new nation

00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:30.078
was supposed to be.
 

00:24:30.078 --> 00:24:33.460
Now, I'm not going to end by
continuing here to talk about

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.713
the end of the Revolution,
because it isn't just the

00:24:36.713 --> 00:24:39.230
events of the Revolution that
mattered,

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:40.529
even when they're ending.
 

00:24:40.529 --> 00:24:43.411
It's actually how we remember
them that matters,

00:24:43.411 --> 00:24:46.414
because the way that we
remember history obviously

00:24:46.414 --> 00:24:49.420
really determines its meaning
and its impact.

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.942
So basically,
history -- and how we

00:24:51.942 --> 00:24:56.248
understand our history -- can
have a profound effect on the

00:24:56.248 --> 00:24:57.509
here and now.
 

00:24:57.509 --> 00:24:59.862
In a way, this is what
Jefferson referred to -- I think

00:24:59.862 --> 00:25:02.432
a couple lectures back -- I've
talked about the dead hand of

00:25:02.432 --> 00:25:04.300
the past;
Jefferson wanting to -- every

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.737
nineteen years,
'let's make a new

00:25:05.737 --> 00:25:06.500
constitution.'
 

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.346
That's kind of linked to that
Jeffersonian idea of the dead

00:25:10.346 --> 00:25:12.987
hand of the past --
and since history could have

00:25:12.987 --> 00:25:15.483
that impact on the present,
depending on how you understand

00:25:15.483 --> 00:25:15.640
it.
 

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:22.088
And that dead hand of the past
can be a pretty heavy hand.

00:25:22.088 --> 00:25:25.105
At this point,
basically I need -- I need to

00:25:25.105 --> 00:25:26.720
tell you an anecdote.
 

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.568
I actually do need to tell you
an anecdote.

00:25:28.568 --> 00:25:30.509
As I was writing the lecture
this morning,

00:25:30.509 --> 00:25:33.740
I was writing about the dead
hand of the past,

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.130
and I guess whenever I use that
phrase,

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:37.038
I think of this one particular
letter I found --

00:25:37.038 --> 00:25:40.785
which actually is relevant,
so I'm not being completely

00:25:40.785 --> 00:25:41.410
random.
 

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:44.598
It does have something to do
with the dead hand of the past

00:25:44.598 --> 00:25:45.368
and history.
 

00:25:45.368 --> 00:25:48.380
It actually also has nothing to
do with the American Revolution,

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.391
but it really shows you how the
past can have an enormous weight

00:25:51.391 --> 00:25:52.298
on the present.
 

00:25:52.298 --> 00:25:55.421
And it's also just an amazing
little piece of paper that I

00:25:55.421 --> 00:25:55.858
found.
 

00:25:55.858 --> 00:25:58.772
And it has to do with this
letter that I found when I was

00:25:58.772 --> 00:26:01.528
rummaging through the Adams
family correspondence,

00:26:01.528 --> 00:26:04.578
which is indeed what it's
called: the Adams family.

00:26:04.578 --> 00:26:07.489
So the John Adams family
correspondence -- and I found

00:26:07.489 --> 00:26:09.519
this letter from John Quincy
Adams.

00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:11.250
I wasn't looking for it,
but I found this letter.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.050
And he was overseas when his
father was running for President

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:18.980
and he -- clearly he really
wants to know if his father won.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:21.773
And it takes a long time for
news to make it across the

00:26:21.773 --> 00:26:23.690
ocean,
so what I found was first one

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:26.380
letter in which he's writing,
'Do you know what happened in

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:26.970
the election?'
 

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.660
And then I found a lot of them.
 

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.785
He's writing to people and
writing to people saying,

00:26:30.785 --> 00:26:31.410
'Do you know?
 

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:32.000
Do you know?
 

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.170
Has my father won the election?
 

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.088
Who's won the election?
 

00:26:34.088 --> 00:26:35.029
What's happened in the
election?'

00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:36.440
So, I can't help it.
 

00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.942
Now I'm following the trail,
because I have to find the

00:26:38.942 --> 00:26:40.240
letter where he finds out.
 

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.038
Right?
 

00:26:41.038 --> 00:26:42.338
And you would assume -- I
assumed --

00:26:42.338 --> 00:26:45.868
that when I found that letter,
he would say something like,

00:26:45.868 --> 00:26:48.740
'Oh, this is a great day for
America' or --

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:51.845
I don't know -- something,
something lofty and

00:26:51.845 --> 00:26:54.395
visionesque,
sort of looking out -- ahh --

00:26:54.395 --> 00:26:56.068
sort of John Quincy Adamsesque.
 

00:26:56.068 --> 00:26:59.963
So finally I find the letter,
and I'm going to paraphrase it

00:26:59.963 --> 00:27:03.595
with my own bad paraphrasing
here, but the point will be

00:27:03.595 --> 00:27:04.190
true.
 

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.160
He basically says, 'Oh, God.
 

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.910
I'll never live up to this.'
 

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:11.390
[laughter]
It is like -- the first thing

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:13.934
he thinks is:
now I'm going to have to be

00:27:13.934 --> 00:27:15.078
President too.
 

00:27:15.078 --> 00:27:18.680
[laughter/laughs]
That was amazing to me.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.900
I really felt for John Quincy
Adams.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.604
You suddenly got a quick flash
of what it felt like to be an

00:27:24.604 --> 00:27:25.654
Adams,
[laughs]

00:27:25.654 --> 00:27:29.115
or particularly -- the Adams
family had a habit of picking

00:27:29.115 --> 00:27:32.334
one Adams per generation and
then dumping all of their

00:27:32.334 --> 00:27:34.519
expectations on that one Adams.
 

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:37.125
Clearly, John Quincy Adams is
this generation's guy,

00:27:37.125 --> 00:27:40.037
so it certainly gives you a
sense of -- I want to say dead

00:27:40.037 --> 00:27:42.747
hand of the past;
I guess it's the live hand of

00:27:42.747 --> 00:27:45.568
the past, because it's his
father, this poor guy.

00:27:45.568 --> 00:27:48.251
Anything his father does he's
clearly like:

00:27:48.251 --> 00:27:49.625
'oh,
damn, [laughs]

00:27:49.625 --> 00:27:52.138
now I have to be President to'
[laughs]

00:27:52.138 --> 00:27:53.404
--
which is amazing,

00:27:53.404 --> 00:27:56.318
but concrete -- a concrete
example of what I'm talking

00:27:56.318 --> 00:27:57.088
about here.
 

00:27:57.088 --> 00:28:00.223
And it certainly shows how the
next generation beyond the

00:28:00.223 --> 00:28:03.694
Founding generation really felt
like they had to live up to the

00:28:03.694 --> 00:28:06.269
achievements of what had gone
before them.

00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:09.078
Now, as far as the people who
had gone before them,

00:28:09.078 --> 00:28:10.798
as far as the Fathers are
concerned,

00:28:10.798 --> 00:28:14.700
they knew that they were
becoming history,

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:18.252
and so they thought about the
making of history and the

00:28:18.252 --> 00:28:20.028
writing of history a lot.
 

00:28:20.028 --> 00:28:23.632
To me, the most concrete
example of people becoming

00:28:23.632 --> 00:28:27.089
history is something that
happened to poor Thomas

00:28:27.089 --> 00:28:29.180
Jefferson in his old age.
 

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.890
I wonder if any of you have
ever seen a life mask.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.608
You know there's death masks
and life masks.

00:28:33.608 --> 00:28:36.923
Death masks are obvious,
but there do exist life masks

00:28:36.923 --> 00:28:37.548
as well.
 

00:28:37.548 --> 00:28:40.295
So again, in Jefferson's old
age, someone went to Monticello

00:28:40.295 --> 00:28:42.390
and they wanted to make a life
mask of him.

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.426
I don't know who this guy was,
but he wasn't good at his job,

00:28:45.426 --> 00:28:47.298
so whatever he did he did it
wrong.

00:28:47.298 --> 00:28:51.969
And his daughter later said she
came into the room to see the

00:28:51.969 --> 00:28:56.638
guy with a hammer and chisel
trying to chip the plaster like:

00:28:56.638 --> 00:28:58.960
'oh,
my God, I killed him.'

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.240
[laughs]
The plaster hardened and they

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:04.570
couldn't get it off [laughter]
so Jefferson's basically

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:08.038
thinking, this is so bad;
[laughs] this is really bad.

00:29:08.038 --> 00:29:10.519
He really was terrified that
that was the end for him.

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:12.299
He literally almost became
history.

00:29:12.299 --> 00:29:12.940
He was history.
 

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.068
He was gone.
 

00:29:14.068 --> 00:29:16.645
[laughter]
Luckily, they got the plaster

00:29:16.645 --> 00:29:18.098
off and he survived.
 

00:29:18.098 --> 00:29:22.538
But aside from the fact that he
almost melted into plaster,

00:29:22.538 --> 00:29:25.844
obviously that whole cohort of
people had really strong

00:29:25.844 --> 00:29:28.660
feelings about the story of the
Revolution,

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.420
about how that story should be
told,

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.267
and they were not in love with
the whole idea that the Founding

00:29:35.267 --> 00:29:38.990
period is some kind of golden
age of patriotic perfection.

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.321
They did not see the Revolution
as some kind of divine strike of

00:29:42.321 --> 00:29:44.577
providence;
they did not see themselves as

00:29:44.577 --> 00:29:45.098
demigods.
 

00:29:45.098 --> 00:29:47.910
And here I'm going to turn to
John Adams,

00:29:47.910 --> 00:29:52.339
which always makes me happy --
who did a really good job in his

00:29:52.339 --> 00:29:56.340
old age of answering letters
from strangers who wanted to

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.200
know: 'Tell us about the
Revolution.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.230
What really happened?'
 

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.814
And in answering,
he did a great job of basically

00:30:03.814 --> 00:30:05.828
popping bubbles of myths.
 

00:30:05.828 --> 00:30:09.192
He basically said over and over
again in one way or another,

00:30:09.192 --> 00:30:12.155
'You know, the Revolution
wasn't some kind of golden,

00:30:12.155 --> 00:30:13.410
wonderful moment.'
 

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:16.587
Now, like the other Founders --
He actually lived to be ninety,

00:30:16.587 --> 00:30:19.098
so unfortunately he had a lot
of these letters.

00:30:19.098 --> 00:30:22.263
I think Jefferson -- I think --
I was about to say Jefferson,

00:30:22.263 --> 00:30:24.531
I think got more,
which obviously would make

00:30:24.531 --> 00:30:25.640
Adams really mad.
 

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:27.111
Like: 'even now
[laughter/laughs]

00:30:27.111 --> 00:30:29.180
they're thinking about him more
than me' --

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.087
but I think all of these guys
were getting these letters from

00:30:33.087 --> 00:30:35.181
people,
basically in one way or another

00:30:35.181 --> 00:30:36.390
saying,
'Tell us.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:36.910
What was it really like?
 

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:37.680
What was it like?
 

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.549
What happened you signed the
Declaration?

00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:40.190
What happened?
 

00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.920
What was it really like?'
 

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:46.058
Jefferson in particular was
driven crazy.

00:30:46.058 --> 00:30:50.162
Jefferson doesn't normally
emote on paper in a deep kind of

00:30:50.162 --> 00:30:52.848
sincere, he's-not-thinking-hard
way.

00:30:52.848 --> 00:30:54.765
You always get a sense he's
thinking really carefully about

00:30:54.765 --> 00:30:57.404
how he expresses himself,
but when he's writing to Adams

00:30:57.404 --> 00:31:00.321
in their old age,
he really sort of vents about

00:31:00.321 --> 00:31:03.039
this whole strangers-writin
g-letters-and-as

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:04.808
king-about-history thing.
 

00:31:04.808 --> 00:31:08.040
So he says -- he complains:
"From sunrise to one or

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.508
two o'clock, and often from
dinner to dark,

00:31:10.508 --> 00:31:12.798
I am drudging at the writing
table.

00:31:12.798 --> 00:31:16.413
And all this to answer letters
into which neither interest nor

00:31:16.413 --> 00:31:19.952
inclination on my part enters;
and often from persons whose

00:31:19.952 --> 00:31:22.240
names I have never before
heard."

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.597
And in this letter,
Jefferson estimates that in

00:31:25.597 --> 00:31:29.468
1822 he got 1,267 of these
letters from people -- just

00:31:29.468 --> 00:31:32.900
strangers: 'tell us about the
Declaration.'

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:34.663
He called it "the
burthen"

00:31:34.663 --> 00:31:35.368
of his life.
 

00:31:35.368 --> 00:31:37.068
And then at one point in this
letter --

00:31:37.068 --> 00:31:39.185
and this is where I felt like
he really hit Jeffersonian

00:31:39.185 --> 00:31:41.449
bottom --
he's whining and whining and

00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:43.079
he's going on,
'I hate this.

00:31:43.079 --> 00:31:43.500
I hate this.
 

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:44.098
Will they stop?'
 

00:31:44.098 --> 00:31:46.868
Probably Adams was thinking,
'send some to me;

00:31:46.868 --> 00:31:48.390
[laughter]
I have something to say.'

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:52.569
But finally at this point in
the letter, Jefferson just

00:31:52.569 --> 00:31:55.279
writes: "Is this
life?"

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:57.711
[laughter]
I just thought -- that's so

00:31:57.711 --> 00:31:58.828
weirdly modern.
 

00:31:58.828 --> 00:32:01.486
That's like something we have
probably all said at one point:

00:32:01.486 --> 00:32:02.150
Is this life?
 

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:03.910
Please stop writing me the
letters.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:07.230
His life actually got worse on
this front.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.519
You got to -- You're feeling
bad for the Founders here.

00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:14.338
People didn't just deluge him
with random letters.

00:32:14.338 --> 00:32:17.558
Strangers made pilgrimages to
Monticello.

00:32:17.558 --> 00:32:20.171
It became like a tourist
attraction and he was still

00:32:20.171 --> 00:32:20.940
living in it.
 

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.490
And so strangers would come and
just swarm around Monticello,

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.885
peering in the windows
[laughter], like:

00:32:27.885 --> 00:32:29.141
'oops,
I broke the glass' --

00:32:29.141 --> 00:32:30.410
[laughter]
like trampling the garden.

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:32.422
[laughter]
He got so overwhelmed by this

00:32:32.422 --> 00:32:35.672
that he basically after a while
left Monticello and lived in one

00:32:35.672 --> 00:32:38.990
of his other homes for a while,
like: 'I just can't take it.

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.133
[laughs]
I'm abandoning my house to the

00:32:41.133 --> 00:32:43.126
strangers;
I'm going to go live in my

00:32:43.126 --> 00:32:44.798
other house for a little while.'
 

00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:46.604
And that's why,
actually those of you who have

00:32:46.604 --> 00:32:49.009
been to Monticello and you've
seen his little sanctuary --

00:32:49.009 --> 00:32:52.483
There's a little area that's
really his and he has sort of

00:32:52.483 --> 00:32:54.740
all his books and his bed and it
--

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.009
really there are doors that can
lock it off to everything,

00:32:57.009 --> 00:32:59.368
which is really there for a
real reason,

00:32:59.368 --> 00:33:01.588
because that was -- that
literally was his sanctuary.

00:33:01.588 --> 00:33:03.558
That was like:
the swarms are outside,

00:33:03.558 --> 00:33:06.007
lock, lock, lock,
lock, like, you're not coming

00:33:06.007 --> 00:33:06.380
in.
 

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:10.240
So, I think it wasn't fun being
a Founder basically.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.160
I think that's what Jefferson
is showing us here.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:16.028
But whether or not they were
happy old Founders,

00:33:16.028 --> 00:33:19.482
the Founding types who were
answering these letters were

00:33:19.482 --> 00:33:22.938
really trying to shape the
telling of the history of the

00:33:22.938 --> 00:33:23.880
Revolution.
 

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.064
And different Founders I'm sure
had different messages,

00:33:26.064 --> 00:33:28.491
and some were probably happier
than others or more optimistic

00:33:28.491 --> 00:33:29.140
than others.
 

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.608
I think James Madison was
optimistic to the end.

00:33:31.608 --> 00:33:35.102
Adams, as I said before,
spent a lot of time sort of

00:33:35.102 --> 00:33:38.390
punching holes in myths about
the Revolution,

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:42.460
that already were circulating
in the 18-teens and the 1820s.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.443
So over and over and over
again, he told people that there

00:33:45.443 --> 00:33:48.009
had not been some kind of
unanimous patriotic,

00:33:48.009 --> 00:33:51.460
glorious moment,
as it seemed to have been,

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.440
looking from the distance of
time.

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.261
So in response to one letter,
he insisted that the Revolution

00:33:57.261 --> 00:34:00.130
was not a big wave of unanimous
patriotism.

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.170
As he put it,
"Every measure of Congress

00:34:03.170 --> 00:34:06.984
from 1774 to 1787 inclusively,
was disputed with acrimony,

00:34:06.984 --> 00:34:09.943
and decided by as small
majorities as any question is

00:34:09.943 --> 00:34:11.650
decided these days"
--

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.659
actually saying,
'It's not we were like,

00:34:13.659 --> 00:34:15.469
yes, independence!'
 

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:17.586
He's saying,
'Sometimes it's one or two

00:34:17.586 --> 00:34:20.451
votes that we decided this,
and it goes out into history

00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:22.664
and all that people know is we
voted yes and it seems

00:34:22.664 --> 00:34:24.670
unanimous,
and it really wasn't.'

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:27.786
Even iconic revolutionary
moments, he thought,

00:34:27.786 --> 00:34:31.527
should not be viewed as the
sort of glorious moments of

00:34:31.527 --> 00:34:32.360
triumph.
 

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.289
He -- In one letter,
he recalled what he was

00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:36.668
thinking as he watched people,
his fellow congressmen,

00:34:36.668 --> 00:34:38.510
sign the Declaration of
Independence.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:40.481
And he said,
"I could not see their

00:34:40.481 --> 00:34:41.139
hearts, ...
 

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:43.869
but, as far as I could
penetrate the intricate foldings

00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:45.681
of their Souls,
I then believed,

00:34:45.681 --> 00:34:47.940
and have not since altered my
Opinion,

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.949
that there were several who
signed with regret,

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.034
and several others,
with many doubts and much

00:34:52.034 --> 00:34:53.030
lukewarmness."
 

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:54.710
So he's saying, 'Okay.
 

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:57.628
Even while they're signing the
Declaration, I don't think some

00:34:57.628 --> 00:35:00.739
of these people actually really
wanted to be signing it at all.

00:35:00.739 --> 00:35:02.840
And some of them,
I think, kind of wished they

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.710
were somewhere else not signing
it' --

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.958
which is not the image that's
floating around at this point

00:35:06.958 --> 00:35:08.199
about what the Revolution was.
 

00:35:08.199 --> 00:35:10.666
So people were disagreeing,
he's saying,

00:35:10.666 --> 00:35:12.690
back in the Revolutionary era.
 

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.010
They caved to the majority.
 

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.018
They weren't sure about what
they were doing.

00:35:16.018 --> 00:35:18.702
They didn't even like what they
were doing sometimes,

00:35:18.702 --> 00:35:20.869
and their decisions weren't
always good.

00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:23.880
He of course had something to
say about that as well,

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.730
so he said in a different
letter, "I say we do not

00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:31.010
make more mistakes now than we
did in 1774,

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:34.360
5,6, 7,8, 9."
 

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.550
He's clearly making a point
here.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.800
When I was copying this I was
like: how many more years?

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:40.920
"80,81, 82,83."
 

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.110
I get your point.
 

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.724
[laughs]
We made a lot of mistakes

00:35:43.724 --> 00:35:45.880
through the whole Revolution,
he's saying.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.320
"It was patched and
piebald ...

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.610
then, as it is now, ...
 

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.789
and ever will be,
world without end."

00:35:50.789 --> 00:35:54.679
Nor were battlefields any more
sacrosanct.

00:35:54.679 --> 00:35:57.871
As Adams put it,
"We blundered at

00:35:57.871 --> 00:36:00.719
Lexington, at Bunker's Hill....
 

00:36:00.719 --> 00:36:03.056
Where, indeed,
did we not blunder except

00:36:03.056 --> 00:36:06.231
Saratoga and Yorktown,
where our Tryumphs redeemed all

00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:07.849
former disgraces?"
 

00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:11.521
So Adams is insisting,
much of the time:

00:36:11.521 --> 00:36:14.159
we weren't all that great.
 

00:36:14.159 --> 00:36:15.849
We made mistakes back then.
 

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:18.909
We didn't always entirely
believe what we were doing.

00:36:18.909 --> 00:36:22.429
It wasn't that different from
how it is now.

00:36:22.429 --> 00:36:25.659
The Revolution was not some
golden age of perfection.

00:36:25.659 --> 00:36:29.099
And Adams summed all of this up
in a letter that I like,

00:36:29.099 --> 00:36:30.670
because in some way -- I don't
know --

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.639
it seems a little more direct
than some of these other

00:36:32.639 --> 00:36:34.038
letters,
and I suppose -- well,

00:36:34.038 --> 00:36:35.610
you'll hear the way he phrases
it.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.568
He wrote this letter in 1811,
and he said to this one

00:36:38.568 --> 00:36:41.469
correspondent -- who said,
'I revere the Fathers.

00:36:41.469 --> 00:36:43.730
I want to be like them.
 

00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:44.539
Ahhh.'
 

00:36:44.539 --> 00:36:46.429
-- all the things he's getting
in all of these letters.

00:36:46.429 --> 00:36:48.257
And he says,
"I ought not to object to

00:36:48.257 --> 00:36:49.869
your reverence for your
fathers....

00:36:49.869 --> 00:36:52.480
But, to tell you a very great
secret,

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.831
as far as I am capable of
comparing the merit of different

00:36:55.831 --> 00:36:57.800
periods,
I have no reason to believe we

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.210
were better than you are."
 

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.920
He was being really
straightforward about this.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.215
Now, all of those quotes of
course are from the sort of

00:37:05.215 --> 00:37:08.389
lofty Adams, the far-seeing
Adams, the sage Adams.

00:37:08.389 --> 00:37:10.793
They're not from the Adams I
was just referring to a few

00:37:10.793 --> 00:37:13.108
minutes ago, which is the
I-don't-get-any-respect John

00:37:13.108 --> 00:37:14.420
Adams, and he's there too.
 

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.411
Both of those things are there
at the same time,

00:37:16.411 --> 00:37:17.809
which also tells you something.
 

00:37:17.809 --> 00:37:19.771
When you read the
correspondence of his old age,

00:37:19.771 --> 00:37:21.565
he's sort of veering back and
forth between:

00:37:21.565 --> 00:37:22.610
I am a lofty Founder.
 

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:25.019
Why won't anyone recognize me
as a lofty Founder?

00:37:25.019 --> 00:37:26.199
I am a lofty Founder.
 

00:37:26.199 --> 00:37:27.730
Please, someone recognize me.
 

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:30.838
He has all these letters where
he's like: 'no one will ever

00:37:30.838 --> 00:37:33.195
make a monument to me,
John Adams' [laughter]

00:37:33.195 --> 00:37:34.590
-- like: so,
so sorry.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:40.639
But my point here is that,
to Adams and to many others,

00:37:40.639 --> 00:37:44.500
you're not supposed to look at
history at this sort of golden,

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:47.320
perfect moment that's
drastically different,

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.130
in that sense,
from everything since.

00:37:51.130 --> 00:37:54.186
In a sense, to these people,
worshipping the founding era,

00:37:54.186 --> 00:37:57.085
or worshipping the American
Revolution, as a golden age

00:37:57.085 --> 00:37:59.070
actually did more harm than
good.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.510
The Revolution had been all
about beginnings,

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:06.079
about beginning traditions and
patterns of governance,

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:08.567
about beginning new
constitutions,

00:38:08.567 --> 00:38:12.184
but these beginnings were
actually supposed to go

00:38:12.184 --> 00:38:13.239
someplace.
 

00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:17.177
They were supposed to lead to
something that actually would

00:38:17.177 --> 00:38:20.300
survive and be shaped by future
generations.

00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.469
So I think to this whole
generation,

00:38:22.469 --> 00:38:26.090
this idea of sort of
worshipping the Founding era as

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:30.349
a golden age made it seem as
though the time for that kind of

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:33.146
work had ended --
as though there was a glorious,

00:38:33.146 --> 00:38:35.719
wonderful creative moment when
things could really be done,

00:38:35.719 --> 00:38:37.710
and now that time is gone.
 

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.820
And you could see that in
Adams' letters too --

00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:42.260
that he says often about the
future: 'Well,

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:44.960
maybe it'll be a brighter page
or maybe it'll be a darker page.

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.659
I don't know.
 

00:38:45.659 --> 00:38:47.139
It's up to you.'
 

00:38:47.139 --> 00:38:50.213
But he assumes -- obviously --
that what they've been doing

00:38:50.213 --> 00:38:53.342
isn't some dead-end moment at
which who knows what'll happen

00:38:53.342 --> 00:38:53.820
next.
 

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.577
He actually assumes they
started something that in one

00:38:56.577 --> 00:38:59.179
way or another they assume is
going to continue.

00:38:59.179 --> 00:39:02.965
So clearly, the time for that
kind of creative political work

00:39:02.965 --> 00:39:06.623
hadn't ended whenever the random
date is that we decide the

00:39:06.623 --> 00:39:11.230
American Revolution ended,
and in a sense it hasn't ended.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:14.344
As the Founding generation well
knew, American citizens are

00:39:14.344 --> 00:39:16.599
always responsible for their
government.

00:39:16.599 --> 00:39:17.710
They control its destiny.
 

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:18.059
Right?
 

00:39:18.059 --> 00:39:20.159
They decide when revolutions
start.

00:39:20.159 --> 00:39:22.300
They decide when revolutions
stop.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:26.739
They control the destiny of the
aftereffect of revolutions.

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:30.067
So I guess in a sense -- And
this is where I was really

00:39:30.067 --> 00:39:31.670
struggling this morning.
 

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:35.500
I was like: what would be the
ultimate message I give to you?

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.614
It's so hard when you teach
courses on the Founding period

00:39:38.614 --> 00:39:41.891
because everything you say has
weird resonance in the present

00:39:41.891 --> 00:39:43.422
--
as I'm kind of saying here --

00:39:43.422 --> 00:39:45.661
and I don't want to have weird
resonance in the present

00:39:45.661 --> 00:39:46.159
[laughs].
 

00:39:46.159 --> 00:39:48.159
I just want to sort of give
something to you guys.

00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:50.849
So related to what I'm saying
here,

00:39:50.849 --> 00:39:54.106
maybe the ultimate message,
the sort of ground-level

00:39:54.106 --> 00:39:57.619
message of this course is:
your opinions matter and your

00:39:57.619 --> 00:40:01.389
actions out there in the world
politically and otherwise are

00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:03.050
going to matter too.
 

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:04.989
That's in essence what these
Founders are saying,

00:40:04.989 --> 00:40:07.619
when they're saying,
'Don't treat us like demigods,

00:40:07.619 --> 00:40:11.025
like we're some lofty
population that will never come

00:40:11.025 --> 00:40:11.550
again.
 

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:14.858
We set something in motion and
the whole point of the thing

00:40:14.858 --> 00:40:18.510
that we set in motion is that
you're supposed to make it run.'

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.699
Right? It's actually about you.
 

00:40:19.699 --> 00:40:21.530
We may be memorable guys.
 

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.574
I might want to be a more
memorable guy than I am,

00:40:24.574 --> 00:40:27.119
but it's all about you;
it's all about you.'

00:40:27.119 --> 00:40:29.340
That's what's supposed to keep
it running in the end.

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:29.746
Okay.
 

00:40:29.746 --> 00:40:34.641
I want to first of all thank
you for laughing at my jokes all

00:40:34.641 --> 00:40:35.619
semester.
 

00:40:35.619 --> 00:40:37.706
[laughter]
Obviously, one of my favorite

00:40:37.706 --> 00:40:41.204
things to do is to tell stories,
and lecture courses are moments

00:40:41.204 --> 00:40:43.880
where you're completely my
hostage and I get to --

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.239
Sometimes as I'm writing a
lecture,

00:40:45.239 --> 00:40:47.268
as today, I'm like:
oh, this isn't related but I'll

00:40:47.268 --> 00:40:49.824
find a way to rope it in to the
lecture so then I can give it to

00:40:49.824 --> 00:40:50.150
you.
 

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:53.018
So, I have greatly enjoyed
myself this semester.

00:40:53.018 --> 00:40:55.650
You've been wonderfully
receptive.

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:58.137
You asked -- When I went to
sections you asked wonderful

00:40:58.137 --> 00:40:58.679
questions.
 

00:40:58.679 --> 00:41:00.750
You engaged with the material.
 

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.614
After lectures you guys kept
coming up to me and asking good

00:41:03.614 --> 00:41:06.577
questions, which was impressive
and doesn't always happen in a

00:41:06.577 --> 00:41:07.500
lecture course.
 

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.509
So I want to thank you because
it makes me really happy if you

00:41:10.509 --> 00:41:13.420
guys are really engaged with
what I'm talking about here.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.119
So, thank you very much.
 

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:18.199
[applause]
 

00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:24.000

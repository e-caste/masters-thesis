00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.980
Prof: Let me start.
 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.010
I'm going to read you something
and you have to guess what kind

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.830
of a scene I'm describing.
 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.856
"A ghostly stillness
descended over the country,

00:00:13.856 --> 00:00:17.030
this country today,
with every restaurant,

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:20.360
bar and teahouse in the country
closed.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.281
Every store shuttered and
police patrolling the streets to

00:00:25.281 --> 00:00:29.080
make sure no citizen dare to
step outside.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.491
Avenues normally clogged with
traffic were so empty that

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:36.275
picnics could have been held on
them, except that nobody would

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:38.260
have been allowed to attend.
 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.122
Plazas that are perpetual
nightmares of congestion and

00:00:42.122 --> 00:00:46.350
exhaust fumes were abandoned to
wandering dogs and cats.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.770
It was also a good day for the
fish because the thousands of

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.815
fishermen who line the
shorelines on Sunday were all at

00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:55.490
home.
 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.987
The waterway itself,
one of the world's busiest

00:00:58.987 --> 00:01:03.170
waterways, was as flat and
silent as a woodland pond.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.182
The government decreed a
six-month term--jail term for

00:01:07.182 --> 00:01:10.739
any citizen who didn't spend the
day at home.

00:01:10.739 --> 00:01:14.456
All in all, the country today
looked like a land on which a

00:01:14.456 --> 00:01:18.367
neutron bomb had been dropped
devastating the population while

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:21.060
leaving the buildings
undamaged."

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.019
What do you think it is?
 

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:25.069
It's drastic.
 

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.799
Student:  The plague?
 

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:30.030
Prof: Nope,
good, reasonable guess,

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.739
but no.
 

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:34.709
Governments weren't as strong
then.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.709
It's the census day in Turkey.
 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:42.873
Some places take their census'
very seriously and require that

00:01:42.873 --> 00:01:47.242
people really be in the place of
their residence so that they can

00:01:47.242 --> 00:01:51.340
be counted and that they get a
very good set of numbers.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.887
The waterway that they're
talking about between Europe and

00:01:57.887 --> 00:02:00.530
Asia running through?
 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.349
Student:  The Bosporus.
 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:02.890
Prof: The Bosporus,
right.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.688
Now compare this to another
country.

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:10.859
An educated and motivated guy
got one of the temporary jobs as

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:12.300
a census taker.
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.388
He was high class enough to get
an article published in The

00:02:16.388 --> 00:02:17.930
Atlantic Monthly.
 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.377
This is New York City.
 

00:02:19.377 --> 00:02:21.750
I'll tell you because you'll
guess.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.039
He was 6'4" and Caucasian.
 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:26.520
They sent him to Chinatown.
 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.680
People took one look at him and
slammed the door.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.780
Others offered him money to go
away;

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.291
even most of those who tried to
cooperate did not have time to

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:40.139
fill out the long form.
 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.930
He asked to be assigned to
another area.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.318
He got Wall Street.
 

00:02:45.318 --> 00:02:47.930
Same story, no one would
cooperate with him.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.997
He couldn't even get into one
building, but this was a

00:02:51.997 --> 00:02:54.300
motivated guy,
like a Yalie.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.818
He climbed onto the roof of the
next building,

00:02:56.818 --> 00:02:59.628
the building next door,
he jumped over the partition,

00:02:59.628 --> 00:03:03.360
not across the street but over
the partition --

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.490
to get into the building that
he was supposed to take the

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.590
census of.
 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.830
Right there on the roof was a
dilapidated shack.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.080
Okay maybe someone's living in
the shack.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.804
He knocks on the door,
someone inside flings open the

00:03:19.804 --> 00:03:20.438
door.
 

00:03:20.438 --> 00:03:25.084
Inside he could see several
apparently naked people lying on

00:03:25.084 --> 00:03:26.580
hospital gurneys.
 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.324
The man who opened the door was
wearing a white coat,

00:03:30.324 --> 00:03:31.764
"Go away!"
 

00:03:31.764 --> 00:03:34.502
He screamed,
"I'm giving my wife a

00:03:34.502 --> 00:03:36.158
cancer treatment."
 

00:03:36.158 --> 00:03:37.598
New York City.
 

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:42.116
A more experienced census taker
told him that he wasn't doing it

00:03:42.116 --> 00:03:42.690
right.
 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.413
What you have to do is what
they say, "curbstone

00:03:45.413 --> 00:03:45.990
it".
 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.893
What that means is you sit on
the sidewalk and guess how many

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:52.038
apartments are in the building.
 

00:03:52.038 --> 00:03:54.266
You look up at the building,
you guess how many apartments

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:56.931
in the building,
and fill out that many forms

00:03:56.931 --> 00:04:00.979
with guesses about how many
people live in each apartment.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.098
That's the way censuses are
done in New York City,

00:04:04.098 --> 00:04:05.688
a comparison to Turkey.
 

00:04:05.688 --> 00:04:10.310
Now these are describing the
1990 Census.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.468
I'll get to the 2000 Census in
a moment.

00:04:13.468 --> 00:04:16.639
That census was the most
expensive ever,

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.079
it missed more than two million
children,

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.819
of course mostly minority
children,

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.600
and imagine what this does for
school planning,

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.730
etcetera, etcetera,
it missed all together--

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.480
not counting just children--ten
million people and it double

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.649
counted,
or it counted in the wrong

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:37.879
place another six million
people.

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:41.882
Between censuses the census
bureau uses the count of the

00:04:41.882 --> 00:04:44.649
last census to make its
projections.

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:47.440
They know the population is
increasing every year,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.490
how much do we have now,
now, now?

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.942
By the time they came from the
1990 to the 2000 Census,

00:04:52.942 --> 00:04:56.458
there were seven million more
people in America then the

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:58.759
Census Bureau thought there was.
 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:02.744
The population had been
increasing something like one

00:05:02.744 --> 00:05:06.269
and half times what they had
thought it was.

00:05:06.269 --> 00:05:07.810
Does this slop matter?
 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.129
The poor quality of the United
States census.

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.303
Well, nowadays these numbers
might seem small but more than

00:05:15.303 --> 00:05:19.262
$185 billion dollars a year in
federal aid to states are

00:05:19.262 --> 00:05:22.790
apportioned according to the
census results,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.889
so every state really wants its
people counted.

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:28.062
On top of that,
what else is apportioned

00:05:28.062 --> 00:05:29.509
depending on the census?
 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:33.081
Congress, the House of
Representatives is apportioned,

00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:37.124
so people want their state to
have as many representatives as

00:05:37.124 --> 00:05:38.000
possible.
 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.509
Given the importance of this,
why is it so bad?

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.430
Why is the U.S.***Census so bad?
 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.269
The answer is primarily
politics.

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:51.185
It is well known,
the kind of problems that this

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:54.350
census taker had in New York is
very well known,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.848
and it's well known that these
people that are considered

00:05:57.848 --> 00:05:59.910
somewhat marginal:
minorities,

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:03.709
immigrants, poor people,
they are heavily undercounted.

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:05.389
This is well known.
 

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:09.117
The problem is that these
people don't vote Republican and

00:06:09.117 --> 00:06:12.519
when this story that I'm telling
you takes place,

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:15.439
the Republicans controlled the
House of Representatives,

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:20.980
which controls the budget.
 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.720
The census has been missing
this eight--

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.468
ten million for the 1990
Census, eight million for

00:06:28.468 --> 00:06:30.384
before,
roughly eight to ten million

00:06:30.384 --> 00:06:33.189
people,
and again, it's these minority

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:35.002
groups,
minorities, renters,

00:06:35.002 --> 00:06:37.365
urban dwellers,
and so Democrats--and they

00:06:37.365 --> 00:06:40.887
generally vote Democrat--
and the Democrats have been

00:06:40.887 --> 00:06:46.100
pushing to get them counted,
to make an accurate account.

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.254
But a Republican redistricting
expert wrote a memorandum in

00:06:50.254 --> 00:06:54.697
1997 predicting that adjustment
could cost the Republican Party

00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:58.290
24 house seats,
which is a huge amount.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.641
So, since then,
the Republicans have blocked

00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:02.500
any modernization of the census.
 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:07.132
For the year 2000 Census,
President Clinton appointed a

00:07:07.132 --> 00:07:11.764
new director of the Census
Bureau, a woman named Martha

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:14.939
Riche who we've had here at
Yale.

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:18.574
She came out of a scientific
and research environment and was

00:07:18.574 --> 00:07:21.846
really very competent,
scholarly, knew how to do it

00:07:21.846 --> 00:07:24.182
right,
and she announced when she came

00:07:24.182 --> 00:07:26.327
into office,
"All industrial

00:07:26.327 --> 00:07:29.949
democracies will be holding a
census in the year 2000.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:33.834
We want the United States to
win a gold medal for

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:35.209
accuracy."
 

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:36.259
She thought she was smart.
 

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:39.637
In fact of course she missed
the boat, because she thought

00:07:39.637 --> 00:07:42.185
she was supposed to make an
accurate census,

00:07:42.185 --> 00:07:44.970
and no, that wasn't what she
was hired for.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.206
What she had proposed was a
statistical way of dealing with

00:07:50.206 --> 00:07:50.839
this.
 

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:53.610
You know the groups that you've
missed,

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.730
you know where they live,
so after you've counted

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.029
everyone as well as you can in
the whole country,

00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:59.860
you go back to the inner city
neighborhoods,

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.807
the various places where you
know that you're going to miss

00:08:03.807 --> 00:08:06.870
people and you really blanket
that and do--

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:09.420
those areas very carefully,
a sample across the country.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.309
Then you find out what your
errors are in that large sample

00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:14.699
and then you can adjust the
whole population,

00:08:14.699 --> 00:08:17.610
assuming you made the same
mistakes everywhere.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:22.740
She was very open,
that's what she planned to do.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.860
At the time,
though, Newt Gingrich,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:29.396
I don't know if you know that
name with the New Deal for

00:08:29.396 --> 00:08:32.837
America or something,
was the Speaker of the House,

00:08:32.837 --> 00:08:35.423
controlled the budget,
and he said,

00:08:35.423 --> 00:08:38.970
'yup, you have the authority to
do that,

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.668
you're the Director of the
budget ,

00:08:40.668 --> 00:08:44.005
but, if you do that,
I will cut your budget to

00:08:44.005 --> 00:08:44.600
zero.'
 

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:49.071
Basically she wasn't allowed to
do that and so she had to

00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:49.788
resign.
 

00:08:49.788 --> 00:08:55.024
She just would not do a census
that was less then what we're

00:08:55.024 --> 00:08:56.710
capable of doing.
 

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.339
The census was done the old
fashioned way,

00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:05.294
it cost $1.7 billion dollars
more than it would have with

00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:09.808
sampling and was not anywhere
near as accurate.

00:09:09.808 --> 00:09:14.720
Now these same considerations
apply almost everywhere.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.231
In China, for instance,
you know about the one child

00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:22.020
policy and the government is
strongly trying to push the

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.330
birthrate down.
 

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:27.320
We'll talk about this later in
much more detail.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.548
A provincial official gets the
word this is--

00:09:31.548 --> 00:09:34.615
we want your population growth
rate to be no more than whatever

00:09:34.615 --> 00:09:37.879
percentage and then he sends it
down to the prefecture and down.

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:39.220
Do you think any of these
officials,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.297
after the census,
are going send up information

00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:43.240
that they have not been doing
their job,

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.889
that the birthrate is higher?
 

00:09:44.889 --> 00:09:49.240
No, so there's problems with
that.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.658
Who collects this data?
 

00:09:50.658 --> 00:09:54.190
Well luckily several--many
organizations collect the data

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:55.639
but primarily the UN.
 

00:09:55.639 --> 00:09:58.529
Who owns the UN?
 

00:09:58.529 --> 00:10:04.782
Member countries,
and if you are,

00:10:04.782 --> 00:10:07.678
say,
a conservative religious

00:10:07.678 --> 00:10:10.991
country, and if the UN
demographer says that contrary

00:10:10.991 --> 00:10:14.010
to government statistics,
that there actually is a high

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.028
rate of illegitimacy or abortion
in the country,

00:10:16.028 --> 00:10:19.308
all of which comes out of the
statistics,

00:10:19.308 --> 00:10:21.668
they're not going to allow that
to be published,

00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:24.851
so the UN has to sort of cut
some corners so that the

00:10:24.851 --> 00:10:28.340
countries from who it is
dependent on to get the data,

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.029
will continue to send them the
data.

00:10:33.029 --> 00:10:36.029
In addition,
even when a country tries,

00:10:36.029 --> 00:10:37.440
there are something like 50
million--

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.683
birth registrations not done
everywhere in the world and

00:10:40.683 --> 00:10:43.279
there's something like 50
million babies,

00:10:43.279 --> 00:10:45.980
worldwide, who were never
registered,

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.240
they don't exist on the
official registers,

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.220
so when you try to do what
demographers do,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.178
you have a count of--a count of
a census in one year,

00:10:55.178 --> 00:10:57.250
you have a count of a census in
a later year,

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.629
in between you have a list of
births and deaths,

00:10:59.629 --> 00:11:01.480
supposedly both births are
registered and deaths are

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.960
registered,
and you see is this reasonable?

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.404
Is the difference accounted for
by births, deaths,

00:11:06.404 --> 00:11:09.399
and migration if you have
reasonable amounts of migration.

00:11:09.399 --> 00:11:16.085
If millions of the babies are
just not registered you can't

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:22.308
check things that way,
so there's a lot of problems.

00:11:22.308 --> 00:11:25.764
Another thing is that in many,
many countries there's conflict

00:11:25.764 --> 00:11:29.254
between different groups,
we've talked about Democratic,

00:11:29.254 --> 00:11:31.350
Republican in the United
States.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:35.452
In Nigeria, in Sudan,
there's a huge conflict between

00:11:35.452 --> 00:11:39.791
the Muslim populations in the
north and the Christian or

00:11:39.791 --> 00:11:42.710
Animist populations in the
south.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.154
You may or may not recall the
Biafra War in Nigeria,

00:11:46.154 --> 00:11:49.529
a huge war between
basically--over oil--but between

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:52.570
the Muslim north and the
Christian south;

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.196
millions of deaths and millions
of deaths now currently in Sudan

00:11:57.196 --> 00:11:59.840
over something of a similar
issue.

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.839
When censuses in ethnically or
religiously split countries are

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:05.923
taken,
the key event is the ratio,

00:12:05.923 --> 00:12:09.019
the key outcome that everybody
wants to know is the ratio

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:12.105
between how many Christians,
how many Muslims,

00:12:12.105 --> 00:12:14.428
how many this,
how many that.

00:12:14.428 --> 00:12:21.520
And so the censuses get totally
distorted by people trying to

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:28.139
raise their numbers and lower
everyone else's numbers.

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:33.003
Before the Biafra War there was
apparently a reasonably accurate

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:37.302
census in 1952 to 1953,
then the Biafra War intervened,

00:12:37.302 --> 00:12:41.370
and the next several censuses
were very controversial.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.621
So the accepted official
figures, in Nigeria,

00:12:45.621 --> 00:12:50.356
were 88.5 million people,
but the World Bank said,

00:12:50.356 --> 00:12:54.320
no, that's wrong,
102 million people.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.889
The United Nations:
120 million people.

00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:00.998
So, basically,
for a country as big and as

00:13:00.998 --> 00:13:05.318
important as Nigeria for their
last census we have figures

00:13:05.318 --> 00:13:09.110
ranging between 88.5 million and
120 million,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:15.250
a 50% uncertainty for Nigeria,
so big.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:19.740
The point of this initial part,
point one,

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.480
is that even the simplest
numbers like headcounts,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.657
we're not doing anything fancy,
we're just trying to count how

00:13:24.657 --> 00:13:27.215
many people there are,
1,2, 3,4, 5,

00:13:27.215 --> 00:13:35.267
there are systematic errors and
very often those errors are

00:13:35.267 --> 00:13:37.350
intentional.
 

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:40.716
Now all of these numbers--well
I say when I described these

00:13:40.716 --> 00:13:43.269
numbers and I probably won't do
it enough.

00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:47.695
When I put up a demographic
number it should almost always

00:13:47.695 --> 00:13:51.303
be qualified by,
'and there are large and

00:13:51.303 --> 00:13:56.460
unknown error bars,' but we
don't have error bars for it.

00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.745
Various organizations collect
all this data and this is called

00:13:59.745 --> 00:14:03.053
the Population Reference Bureau,
which is a source of statistics

00:14:03.053 --> 00:14:06.942
and news,
everything about population and

00:14:06.942 --> 00:14:10.000
it's a very big sheet here.
 

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.634
I'll show it to you blown up
and it has every region of the

00:14:13.634 --> 00:14:16.782
world,
every country of the world,

00:14:16.782 --> 00:14:21.754
and a large number of
demographic statistics for each

00:14:21.754 --> 00:14:23.860
of these countries.
 

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:34.852
Let's look at one of these,
so here is one page of this

00:14:34.852 --> 00:14:42.590
sheet--can you see that well
enough?

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.460
I don't need to put the lights
out.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:50.779
What you see is the various
numbers that they count,

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:55.500
population, birthrate,
death rate, rate of increase,

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.529
migration rate,
in or out, plus for coming in,

00:14:59.529 --> 00:15:04.089
out for going out,
what their projected population

00:15:04.089 --> 00:15:07.533
is for 2025 or 2050,
and so forth down there,

00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:10.682
a number that we'll try to get
to describe later called the

00:15:10.682 --> 00:15:13.234
total fertility rate,
which is more or less the

00:15:13.234 --> 00:15:15.048
number of children women are
expect--

00:15:15.048 --> 00:15:18.570
will have as they go through
their lifetime.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.250
Then on this side it's broken
down first into the world,

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:23.440
broken down by level of
development,

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.527
then by geographic region,
so there are a lot of really

00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:31.738
very good data,
very clearly put on here,

00:15:31.738 --> 00:15:38.120
and you can look first at the
world's population here,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.149
so that's the first number in
the whole thing.

00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:46.419
This is the middle of 2008 so
there were 6.7 billion people on

00:15:46.419 --> 00:15:48.990
earth and still rising.
 

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:54.948
The expectation for mid-2025 is
8 billion and for 2050,9.3 or

00:15:54.948 --> 00:15:56.340
9.4 billion.
 

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:00.578
Those are guesses about the
future and I'll tell you maybe a

00:16:00.578 --> 00:16:03.308
little bit about how those are
done.

00:16:03.308 --> 00:16:12.393
Look now at the birthrate here,
so this is births per 1,000

00:16:12.393 --> 00:16:20.379
population and the birthrate of
the world is 21,

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:23.059
and I'm going to go crazy going
back and forth there.

00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:27.220
How accurate is that?
 

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.250
Again we don't know,
large and uncertain error bars,

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.182
it's something like a third of
the children in the world that

00:16:33.182 --> 00:16:35.823
don't have proper birth
certificates and you can't know

00:16:35.823 --> 00:16:37.779
whether they've been counted at
all.

00:16:37.779 --> 00:16:40.003
Another thing that you should
notice about the way it gets

00:16:40.003 --> 00:16:42.567
organized--
is not only the world when it

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:46.397
breaks it down into development
categories there's less

00:16:46.397 --> 00:16:49.917
developed countries,
that includes China and less

00:16:49.917 --> 00:16:52.320
developed countries excluding
China.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.416
It's important to get those two
things different because China

00:16:56.416 --> 00:17:01.255
is considered very exceptional,
1) because of its one child

00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:06.273
policy and they think that the
birthrate is abnormally

00:17:06.273 --> 00:17:09.202
depressed,
and 2) it's tremendous rate of

00:17:09.202 --> 00:17:10.380
economic development.
 

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:13.665
If you want a real
characterization of the less

00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:16.699
developed countries,
even though China's average

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:20.660
income is very low,
it's changing very rapidly,

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:26.740
then you do it without China
and you get different numbers

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:27.700
there.
 

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:40.490
Look next at the birthrate
for--the birthrate for the whole

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:49.644
world is 21 per 1,000 per year,
and the birthrate for the less

00:17:49.644 --> 00:17:53.240
developed countries is 23,
not a big difference.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.779
Why is that?
 

00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:56.410
How come it's so close?
 

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.760
Whereas, for the developed
countries it's 12,

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.873
why is the birthrate for the
world so close to the less

00:18:03.873 --> 00:18:04.940
developed?
 

00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.282
Student:  Because the
majority of the population

00:18:06.282 --> 00:18:06.930
resides in those places.
 

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.490
Prof: Right,
the overwhelming majority of

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:12.380
the population is in the less
developed countries,

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.900
so whatever we understand about
that,

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:23.640
that is what we have to--that
is characteristic of the world.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:32.961
This difference in birthrate
between say 12 in the more

00:18:32.961 --> 00:18:40.595
developed countries and say 23,
26, even 36 for the least

00:18:40.595 --> 00:18:43.618
developed countries,
that is a huge difference.

00:18:43.618 --> 00:18:48.208
It's a factor of three between
the most developed and the least

00:18:48.208 --> 00:18:51.560
developed,
and a factor of something like

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.651
2.5--
over 2 in between,

00:18:53.651 --> 00:18:57.588
which means that now most of
the world is--

00:18:57.588 --> 00:19:01.702
in the underdeveloped countries
most of the population and that

00:19:01.702 --> 00:19:04.490
will continue and will get more
extreme.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:09.603
Here is an example of that,
this is--we are now about here

00:19:09.603 --> 00:19:13.730
and the more developed regions
like the U.S.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:18.776
are still growing very slightly
but basically going to be flat

00:19:18.776 --> 00:19:21.920
as far as one can project out
here,

00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:25.055
but the less developed
countries are undergoing this

00:19:25.055 --> 00:19:26.470
population explosion.
 

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:31.691
If the ratio between the less
developed countries and the

00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:37.191
developed regions is this now,
that will only increase after

00:19:37.191 --> 00:19:38.868
2050 out here.
 

00:19:38.868 --> 00:19:43.112
This--that the world is
demographically characterized by

00:19:43.112 --> 00:19:45.890
the poor countries is a fact
now,

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.910
and a much better fact,
as time goes on,

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:52.118
a more complete fact.
 

00:19:52.118 --> 00:19:55.385
That's--the first point is
about inaccuracies of

00:19:55.385 --> 00:19:58.076
statistics,
the second one here is that

00:19:58.076 --> 00:20:01.636
it's not the developed countries
when you think of what's

00:20:01.636 --> 00:20:05.261
happening in world population
don't think of the developed

00:20:05.261 --> 00:20:08.813
countries,
what's happening is what's

00:20:08.813 --> 00:20:14.173
happening the underdeveloped
countries or the developing

00:20:14.173 --> 00:20:15.440
countries.
 

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.990
Now let's shift and look at the
death rate.

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:21.273
We looked a little at the
birthrate, and you notice

00:20:21.273 --> 00:20:26.384
something very interesting;
here's the birthrate we've just

00:20:26.384 --> 00:20:31.450
been saying for the world 21 per
1,000 per year.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:35.325
Look at the death rate,
eight, that means there's more

00:20:35.325 --> 00:20:38.690
than two and a half times in the
world now--

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:43.660
there's two and a half times as
many births as there are deaths,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:50.259
an enormous difference and you
can compare,

00:20:50.259 --> 00:20:53.636
in the less developed regions,
there's something like three

00:20:53.636 --> 00:20:56.200
times as many births as there
are deaths,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.630
9 deaths, 26 births,
so there's a huge--

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:04.337
right now there's a huge
imbalance between the births and

00:21:04.337 --> 00:21:05.200
the deaths.
 

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.894
As you know population
stability, which many people

00:21:07.894 --> 00:21:10.318
think would be a good thing for
the world,

00:21:10.318 --> 00:21:15.568
depends on the deaths and the
births being equal,

00:21:15.568 --> 00:21:17.990
which means that the world is
out of kilter,

00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:21.907
the ratio between births and
deaths is now out of kilter by a

00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:24.259
factor of something like 2.5 to
3;

00:21:24.259 --> 00:21:28.868
2.5 for the world,
3 for the developing countries.

00:21:28.868 --> 00:21:33.194
What that means is either the
death rate has to come up to

00:21:33.194 --> 00:21:37.065
that level or the birthrate has
to come down or some

00:21:37.065 --> 00:21:38.279
combination.
 

00:21:38.279 --> 00:21:42.461
Part of this is,
well, we'll see--what's going

00:21:42.461 --> 00:21:46.180
to happen with part of it a bit
later.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:51.276
The major point of this is that
the world is very far from

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:53.690
population stabilization.
 

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.712
You've probably heard lots in
the news about declining

00:21:55.712 --> 00:21:57.787
birthrates in Europe,
and Japan and so forth,

00:21:57.787 --> 00:21:59.900
and our next lecture will be
about that,

00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.598
will be just about that.
 

00:22:01.598 --> 00:22:04.720
It's not characteristic of the
world.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:08.751
The world is way out of
balance, and even in the United

00:22:08.751 --> 00:22:13.307
States which is one of the few
developing countries that still

00:22:13.307 --> 00:22:19.644
is having a population increase,
we have 14 births for every

00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:23.973
eight deaths,
and that's 1 and 3/4 times the

00:22:23.973 --> 00:22:28.039
number of births as deaths,
so the United States is way out

00:22:28.039 --> 00:22:30.568
of whack,
and that's births versus deaths.

00:22:30.568 --> 00:22:32.608
That doesn't include
immigration.

00:22:32.608 --> 00:22:35.183
It includes the children of
immigrants that are born in this

00:22:35.183 --> 00:22:37.058
country but doesn't include
immigration,

00:22:37.058 --> 00:22:42.607
so our births plus immigration
is going to be at least double

00:22:42.607 --> 00:22:50.614
our birthrate,
so our population is also not

00:22:50.614 --> 00:22:55.940
anywhere near balanced.
 

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:01.000
Okay, now unlike the birthrate
which is very different in

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.518
different parts of the world,
the death rate is not

00:23:05.518 --> 00:23:08.230
extraordinarily different.
 

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:12.440
Here--I see you squinting;
can you see it well enough?

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.082
The death rate in the developed
countries is 10 per 1,000 and in

00:23:17.082 --> 00:23:20.881
the less developed countries,
again without China,

00:23:20.881 --> 00:23:24.880
it's 9 per 1,000,
a very small difference.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.160
The reason for that is,
is that mortality has fallen--

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:33.210
because of vaccination
programs, especially vaccination

00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:36.064
programs,
oral rehydration for diarrhea

00:23:36.064 --> 00:23:39.298
and a lot of very basic public
health matters,

00:23:39.298 --> 00:23:41.538
not open heart surgery or
anything like that,

00:23:41.538 --> 00:23:45.820
but the most basic public
health measures has dropped the

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.880
death rate in the world
tremendously,

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.450
again especially the infant
death rate.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:57.848
Sub-Saharan Africa is somewhat
of an exception to that.

00:23:57.848 --> 00:24:04.397
Anybody remember--maybe you
studied it, what I said was sort

00:24:04.397 --> 00:24:09.058
of pre-modern death rate,
somebody said it,

00:24:09.058 --> 00:24:15.997
I think they said it right;
about 40 per 1,000 and now it's

00:24:15.997 --> 00:24:21.185
down to Œ
of that which is a modern rate

00:24:21.185 --> 00:24:27.730
and it's not going to decrease
an enormous amount more.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.838
Fertility--so the changes in
the death,

00:24:31.838 --> 00:24:34.130
when you look about the future
of population,

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:38.169
further changes in the death
rate will have some effect but

00:24:38.169 --> 00:24:39.910
not an enormous effect.
 

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:43.220
Its change in the fertility
rate, the whole future world

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:46.529
population depends essentially
on the fertility rate.

00:24:46.529 --> 00:24:48.670
A little bit from a change in
the death rate,

00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:52.568
somewhat from people aging,
but primarily fertility rate is

00:24:52.568 --> 00:24:56.268
what you watch to find out
what's going to happen in the

00:24:56.268 --> 00:25:00.026
future of world population,
unless of course we have atom

00:25:00.026 --> 00:25:02.740
bombs or something like that and
everybody dies.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:07.863
Now as an example of this
death--flatness of the death

00:25:07.863 --> 00:25:13.276
rate -- this is from Egypt,
there's a lovely graph notice

00:25:13.276 --> 00:25:17.240
the little baby in swaddling
clothes.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.304
This is from the Egyptian
Statistical Abstract,

00:25:20.304 --> 00:25:24.034
the Egyptians published this
themselves, and it's not the

00:25:24.034 --> 00:25:25.098
most recent.
 

00:25:25.098 --> 00:25:27.838
It goes up to about 1990 and
maybe now they've gotten more

00:25:27.838 --> 00:25:30.528
computerized and don't dress the
things up like that,

00:25:30.528 --> 00:25:34.205
but I just liked that and that
color is the original color in

00:25:34.205 --> 00:25:36.288
the original statistical report.
 

00:25:36.288 --> 00:25:40.977
Notice the number of births
increasing continuously with

00:25:40.977 --> 00:25:45.578
some small dip here but
basically it goes from 1,000 to

00:25:45.578 --> 00:25:47.880
up here would be 2,000.
 

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.320
In this period of time the
birthrate nearly doubles and

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.680
this is absolute number of
people,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.250
not a percentage,
but look what happens in the

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.730
death rate,
very little change.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.390
The death rate,
starting way back in 1952,

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:05.920
so way before a lot of very
modern kind of medical stuff,

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.960
so it's basic medical--basic
public health,

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.130
basic sanitation that's
responsible for this.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.955
So the number of deaths is
staying more or less constant

00:26:14.955 --> 00:26:16.910
and of course the natural
increase,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:19.961
the increase in the population
is the difference between births

00:26:19.961 --> 00:26:23.105
and deaths,
so you have it increasing every

00:26:23.105 --> 00:26:24.700
year,
you get more and more

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.740
population increase.
 

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:28.615
This is the population
explosion and you've seen

00:26:28.615 --> 00:26:29.838
numbers like that.
 

00:26:29.838 --> 00:26:34.799
Now is the death rate staying
constant?

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.307
No, the death rate is not
staying--because the population

00:26:45.307 --> 00:26:48.220
is increasing and yet you're
having the same number of

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.982
deaths,
so the percentage of the

00:26:50.982 --> 00:26:55.980
population that's dying each
year is going down slowly,

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:00.288
not at a -- as a percentage --
it is a slow decrease,

00:27:00.288 --> 00:27:02.750
so over this period time period
and continuing,

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:06.788
the death rate is decreasing
but not in a--

00:27:06.788 --> 00:27:11.797
significant enough to make a
big difference in the total

00:27:11.797 --> 00:27:14.618
population growth statistics.
 

00:27:14.618 --> 00:27:22.096
The basic thing in the world is
that the fertility rate is what

00:27:22.096 --> 00:27:26.410
can change a lot,
can make the difference between

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:30.151
a world whose population keeps
growing or stabilizes or starts

00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:31.009
decreasing.
 

00:27:31.009 --> 00:27:36.200
Now, anybody notice anything
funny so far?

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:40.092
One number that should
have--one pair of numbers that

00:27:40.092 --> 00:27:41.588
should have--what?
 

00:27:41.588 --> 00:27:46.605
Let's go back to that,
anything funny about these

00:27:46.605 --> 00:27:47.650
numbers?
 

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:50.685
Student:  The less
developed countries have a

00:27:50.685 --> 00:27:51.519
little less.
 

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:54.763
Prof: Yes,
so the less developed countries

00:27:54.763 --> 00:27:58.818
have a lower death rate than the
more developed countries.

00:27:58.818 --> 00:28:03.873
That's surprising that their
health systems or their health

00:28:03.873 --> 00:28:05.788
is better than ours.
 

00:28:05.788 --> 00:28:09.481
Let's just check that number
and let's look at for instance

00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:12.219
compare the United States with
our neighbor,

00:28:12.219 --> 00:28:12.920
Mexico.
 

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.092
We know Mexico is much poorer
and probably doesn't have as

00:28:17.092 --> 00:28:20.825
good a healthcare system,
well here's our deaths per

00:28:20.825 --> 00:28:24.681
1,000 in the United States is 8;
Mexico is 5,

00:28:24.681 --> 00:28:29.262
it's a good bit less then we
have and further,

00:28:29.262 --> 00:28:35.472
here is Central America there's
not a single country that's as

00:28:35.472 --> 00:28:37.509
high as we are.
 

00:28:37.509 --> 00:28:39.098
Every single one of the Central
American countries,

00:28:39.098 --> 00:28:40.700
including some pretty poor
countries,

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:45.662
El Salvador has a lower death
rate then the United States and

00:28:45.662 --> 00:28:50.460
Mexico is kind of in the middle
between the 4 and the 6.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:58.096
Striking, you go further afield
here, here's the Caribbean and

00:28:58.096 --> 00:29:03.230
these are more in the range of
the U.S.

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.276
level but they're--the U.S.
 

00:29:05.276 --> 00:29:09.519
is not better than almost any
of them except for Haiti.

00:29:09.519 --> 00:29:13.574
Haiti is the only place that
has a noticeably worse death

00:29:13.574 --> 00:29:14.660
rate then us.
 

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.414
Student:  Do those death
rates include the infant

00:29:16.414 --> 00:29:16.990
mortality rates?
 

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:17.519
Prof: What?
 

00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:19.319
Student:  Do those death
rates include the infant

00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:19.910
mortality rates?
 

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.828
Prof: Yes,
these are total death rates.

00:29:21.828 --> 00:29:24.122
Once you're born,
if you die after you're born,

00:29:24.122 --> 00:29:24.970
you're counted.
 

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:33.890
Don't include spontaneous or
induced abortions.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:39.827
We got a problem here,
what do you think is the reason

00:29:39.827 --> 00:29:41.058
for this?
 

00:29:41.058 --> 00:29:44.179
Student:  Because the
United States has more older

00:29:44.179 --> 00:29:45.848
people than other countries.
 

00:29:45.848 --> 00:29:47.788
Prof: Exactly,
the United States has more

00:29:47.788 --> 00:29:50.019
older people,
and it's a funny thing about

00:29:50.019 --> 00:29:52.556
older people,
they're the ones who tend to

00:29:52.556 --> 00:29:52.858
die.
 

00:29:52.858 --> 00:29:55.663
Once you get rid of your infant
mortality issue,

00:29:55.663 --> 00:29:57.990
people tend to die at the older
ages.

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:01.526
That's exactly correct,
and it's an extreme--in a

00:30:01.526 --> 00:30:04.990
developed country it's an
extreme difference.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.528
Here is what's left,
so this is the United States.

00:30:07.528 --> 00:30:11.500
This is the deaths per 1,000,
the age of the people,

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.730
and here's what's left of the
infant mortality,

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.338
it's still more dangerous to be
an infant than later,

00:30:16.338 --> 00:30:19.619
but there's virtually--you
can't even see the death rate

00:30:19.619 --> 00:30:23.973
through the middle years,
but then boom it goes up as you

00:30:23.973 --> 00:30:26.400
get on into the older ages.
 

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.750
Indeed, the death rate is
completely sensitive to your age

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.955
distribution,
a country that has more young

00:30:33.955 --> 00:30:37.009
people will have a lower death
rate.

00:30:37.009 --> 00:30:40.073
A country that has a high
birthrate will have more young

00:30:40.073 --> 00:30:42.458
people,
will have a lower death rate,

00:30:42.458 --> 00:30:45.358
so what you're seeing in that
anomaly there,

00:30:45.358 --> 00:30:49.500
what looked like an anomaly,
is basically that Mexico has a

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.568
higher birthrate of people.
 

00:30:51.568 --> 00:30:56.430
This funny thing,
you happen to be born young and

00:30:56.430 --> 00:31:02.000
you die old, and so that is the
explanation for that.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.310
Any time--almost any
demographic number that you want

00:31:05.310 --> 00:31:07.720
to interpret,
marriage rates,

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.567
birthrates, death rates,
fertility rates,

00:31:11.567 --> 00:31:16.151
almost everything of interest
is affected by the age

00:31:16.151 --> 00:31:17.588
distribution.
 

00:31:17.588 --> 00:31:21.996
In understanding demographic
statistics, the most important

00:31:21.996 --> 00:31:24.960
thing is always the age
distribution.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.410
You always have to pay
attention to that,

00:31:27.410 --> 00:31:32.246
and later on I'll show you one
of the mechanisms for paying

00:31:32.246 --> 00:31:34.432
attention--
for getting

00:31:34.432 --> 00:31:40.348
statistics--adjusting statistics
for the age distribution.

00:31:40.348 --> 00:31:42.960
How--first let's just look at
it.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.390
So here is the easiest way of
looking at an age distribution.

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:50.192
What you have here,
this is for Germany and the

00:31:50.192 --> 00:31:53.519
pink is the old--
this is 1989 when East and West

00:31:53.519 --> 00:31:56.660
Germany were still split,
so this is the German

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.930
Democratic Republic,
East Germany,

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.699
the pink is East Germans and
the dark is the Federal

00:32:02.699 --> 00:32:05.240
Republic,
West Germany,

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:11.568
and on the left is men and on
the right is female,

00:32:11.568 --> 00:32:16.292
male and female,
and what this graph says is

00:32:16.292 --> 00:32:19.753
that every year--
so this is age zero,

00:32:19.753 --> 00:32:24.423
you're just born,
to age 100, that every year

00:32:24.423 --> 00:32:28.910
they ask how many people are
there?

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:32.420
How many kids are there between
age zero and one?

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:34.575
Well there's so many males and
so many females,

00:32:34.575 --> 00:32:37.338
this number in East Germany,
this number in West Germany.

00:32:37.338 --> 00:32:41.278
You can go through every age
and just count from your census

00:32:41.278 --> 00:32:45.348
the number of people at that age
and draw it out like this.

00:32:45.348 --> 00:32:48.799
It's a wonderful huge amount of
information in a single graph;

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:50.670
you can see all kinds of things.
 

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:55.090
This is World War I,
the people born during World

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.473
War I,
they're almost all gone,

00:32:57.473 --> 00:33:01.102
but here's the ones from World
War II and look at the big

00:33:01.102 --> 00:33:02.009
difference.
 

00:33:02.009 --> 00:33:04.019
Here's your females.
 

00:33:04.019 --> 00:33:06.049
Here's your males.
 

00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:11.079
What's the difference?
 

00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:14.824
War deaths;
the men are in the Army and the

00:33:14.824 --> 00:33:17.932
get shot up on the Russian
front, so you have many more

00:33:17.932 --> 00:33:19.200
females then males.
 

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.618
It's partially that women live
older also but this case in

00:33:22.618 --> 00:33:26.380
Germany is almost exclusive--
is overwhelmingly the deaths

00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:28.782
from World War I,
here there's still some

00:33:28.782 --> 00:33:32.855
females, there's no males,
and then the deaths from World

00:33:32.855 --> 00:33:33.578
War II.
 

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:36.957
You can see the birth deficit,
these are people who would have

00:33:36.957 --> 00:33:39.673
been born during World War I,
these were adults,

00:33:39.673 --> 00:33:41.769
fighting age adults during
World War I.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:45.453
These would have been born
while the men were away so they

00:33:45.453 --> 00:33:47.068
didn't have any babies.
 

00:33:47.068 --> 00:33:52.301
They had very few babies during
World War I and the same thing

00:33:52.301 --> 00:33:56.932
you see for World War II,
and you see again the deficit

00:33:56.932 --> 00:33:59.848
of--well we talked about that.
 

00:33:59.848 --> 00:34:03.978
You can see that,
then you can see there's a post

00:34:03.978 --> 00:34:07.217
war baby boom,
after the deficit in World War

00:34:07.217 --> 00:34:10.358
II people make up for it and
more than make up for the

00:34:10.358 --> 00:34:13.699
deficit,
so you have this huge bulge in

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:16.739
population,
both males and females,

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:19.925
but now balanced,
more or less equal numbers of

00:34:19.925 --> 00:34:23.103
males and females,
and then you get the baby bust

00:34:23.103 --> 00:34:25.510
and you get a little echo
effect,

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:27.788
so there's
variations--fluctuations in

00:34:27.788 --> 00:34:30.202
population--
almost every country

00:34:30.202 --> 00:34:34.625
has--Western country has these
kind of data plus the Asian

00:34:34.625 --> 00:34:38.349
countries that were involved in
World War II.

00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:44.289
You can see it's a wonderful
way of understanding a country.

00:34:44.289 --> 00:34:55.639
Now this is India--the census
of India, that's a weird one.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:56.989
What the heck is going on there?
 

00:35:04.989 --> 00:35:06.871
That's weird,
so what it is,

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:09.309
is people don't know their
ages,

00:35:09.309 --> 00:35:12.309
they're innumerate,
and so it gets counted every

00:35:12.309 --> 00:35:15.282
five or ten years,
so here's a five year or a ten

00:35:15.282 --> 00:35:15.989
year period.
 

00:35:15.989 --> 00:35:18.621
They know their ages
approximately,

00:35:18.621 --> 00:35:22.490
to approximately a certain
year, they don't know it

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:23.420
exactly.
 

00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.318
It's not important,
in a pre-industrial country

00:35:26.318 --> 00:35:29.659
their exact age is not all that
terribly important.

00:35:29.659 --> 00:35:34.262
You get this--that's called age
heaping, that when you get a

00:35:34.262 --> 00:35:37.849
large excess in five or ten year
increments.

00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:39.666
My own father,
who was an immigrant,

00:35:39.666 --> 00:35:40.860
did not know his age.
 

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:43.936
There was--he was born in
either 1904 or 1907 because he

00:35:43.936 --> 00:35:47.404
even had a birth certificate but
it was in the Russian Cyrillic

00:35:47.404 --> 00:35:50.090
characters and the four looks
like a seven,

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:56.057
so he and my mother argued
constantly over how old he

00:35:56.057 --> 00:35:57.780
actually was.
 

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.952
Even countries that have had a
long--European have the same

00:36:00.952 --> 00:36:01.389
thing.
 

00:36:01.389 --> 00:36:05.684
Here is the Soviet Union from
their 1937 census and here again

00:36:05.684 --> 00:36:08.429
you get this same age heaping
effect.

00:36:08.429 --> 00:36:11.570
Not quite as extreme as India
but very clearly here,

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:15.409
and to a degree worse with
women then with men,

00:36:15.409 --> 00:36:18.179
because women are less
educated, see the big bars here,

00:36:18.179 --> 00:36:21.452
the small bars here,
and in principle it should be

00:36:21.452 --> 00:36:25.260
getting less with younger people
it should be clearer,

00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:28.717
and you certainly do get rid of
these extreme on certain of

00:36:28.717 --> 00:36:33.141
these but it's not--
it's persisting into the 1930s

00:36:33.141 --> 00:36:39.675
this 'I don't know how old I am
except within a five or ten year

00:36:39.675 --> 00:36:40.920
bracket.'
 

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:48.179
Here's another weirdo,
what's that?

00:36:48.179 --> 00:36:51.056
Just to show you that you can
immediately, once you get used

00:36:51.056 --> 00:36:53.882
to this, immediately tell an
awful lot about a country from

00:36:53.882 --> 00:36:54.809
an age pyramid.
 

00:37:01.949 --> 00:37:05.420
Anybody from Arizona?
 

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:06.940
Nobody from--what?
 

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:10.210
Student: 
&gt;

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.661
Prof: It's Sun City,
Arizona which is a retirement

00:37:13.661 --> 00:37:16.250
community and they don't allow
anybody--

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.980
I think most of these have an
age limit of 50,

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.719
you have to be at least 55,
so this is the retirement age,

00:37:22.719 --> 00:37:25.362
and where my mother lives in
Century Village in West Palm

00:37:25.362 --> 00:37:27.983
Beach looks like this --
Florida looks like that,

00:37:27.983 --> 00:37:30.911
various retired--
California has retirement

00:37:30.911 --> 00:37:33.170
villages they look like that.
 

00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:37.833
These population pyramids are
wonderful with lots of

00:37:37.833 --> 00:37:43.501
information packed into this and
from seeing these pyramids you

00:37:43.501 --> 00:37:48.440
can tell a lot about the
socioeconomic character of the

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:53.744
countries because we know that
the poor countries have less

00:37:53.744 --> 00:37:57.639
literacy,
etc., etc., and they have

00:37:57.639 --> 00:38:02.860
higher birthrates and so we'll
look at what that looks like

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:04.030
right now.
 

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:08.590
Here are two of these
population pyramids and here

00:38:08.590 --> 00:38:11.146
is--
you saw in those the splitting

00:38:11.146 --> 00:38:14.010
of the world into more developed
regions,

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:16.480
and less developed regions.
 

00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.360
What do you notice right away?
 

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.623
The total area under this,
so this is now five-year age

00:38:22.623 --> 00:38:27.068
heaps rather than single year,
so between zero and four is

00:38:27.068 --> 00:38:29.000
this amount,
or this amount,

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.820
so it's the area under this is
how many total people there are.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.489
One you see there's a lot less
area here,

00:38:34.489 --> 00:38:38.184
a lot less people,
the less developed regions are

00:38:38.184 --> 00:38:42.880
the bulk of the world but also
the shape is very different.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:49.282
Here in the developed regions
you have a more or less similar

00:38:49.282 --> 00:38:52.590
number of people in all ages.
 

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:54.670
It's not exactly that way.
 

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:58.083
Of course at the old age people
are dying and that starts about

00:38:58.083 --> 00:39:01.168
here in the 50s and then
accelerates and there's very few

00:39:01.168 --> 00:39:04.072
left,
so it narrows here and also

00:39:04.072 --> 00:39:09.476
it's narrowing down here because
the birthrate in the developed

00:39:09.476 --> 00:39:13.833
countries is now below
replacement level and so the

00:39:13.833 --> 00:39:19.324
pyramids are getting to be fewer
people in the younger ages then

00:39:19.324 --> 00:39:21.940
there are older people.
 

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:26.409
Contrast that with less
developed parts of the world and

00:39:26.409 --> 00:39:30.391
you see that there's more and
more younger people,

00:39:30.391 --> 00:39:34.050
each age cohort has more and
more people.

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:40.282
You can look at an individual
country, and this is a clearer

00:39:40.282 --> 00:39:41.340
example.
 

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:44.429
This is Nigeria as far as we
can tell from their census,

00:39:44.429 --> 00:39:48.159
but they--you can tell an age
distribution and this is now

00:39:48.159 --> 00:39:51.170
percent rather than total from
sub-samples,

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.318
you don't need to count
absolutely everybody to

00:39:53.318 --> 00:39:55.280
understand what the age
distribution is.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:59.864
Here is a 50-year change,
there's not one--it's not

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:01.789
changing very much.
 

00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:04.876
This is what it was in 1975,
they know more or less what it

00:40:04.876 --> 00:40:08.070
is now, and they're projecting
it out to 2005--;I'm sorry.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:12.920
This is pretty current and it
looks about the same,

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.117
and vastly as you go in this
case, as you go to younger and

00:40:16.117 --> 00:40:21.628
younger people,
vastly more children than older

00:40:21.628 --> 00:40:22.650
folks.
 

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:26.530
So what's happening here--see
what the ages are here,

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:30.657
especially in Nigeria,
15 to 45, these are the ages in

00:40:30.657 --> 00:40:35.487
which women are giving birth and
this number of women is giving

00:40:35.487 --> 00:40:40.030
birth to more than two children,
they're more then replacing

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.594
themselves,
so each bar is bigger than the

00:40:43.594 --> 00:40:45.806
last,
and some of this in-swing,

00:40:45.806 --> 00:40:48.219
especially this is Sub-Saharan
Africa,

00:40:48.219 --> 00:40:51.271
some of this reduction is
infant mortality and child

00:40:51.271 --> 00:40:51.989
mortality.
 

00:40:51.989 --> 00:40:54.657
Some of the differences,
especially between this bar and

00:40:54.657 --> 00:40:57.230
this bar, that's in there,
but it's a small effect.

00:40:57.230 --> 00:41:05.398
The major effect is that every
generation is bigger and they

00:41:05.398 --> 00:41:10.659
produce more and more children
here.

00:41:10.659 --> 00:41:22.079
Now--so when you look at
how--what's going to evolve in

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:28.606
the future--
so here is your women who are

00:41:28.606 --> 00:41:32.148
40 to 45,
that's this bunch of women and

00:41:32.148 --> 00:41:34.739
women on this side,
so that's the number of women.

00:41:34.739 --> 00:41:38.320
They're producing part of these
children.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.286
In another five years,
if you look at this five years

00:41:41.286 --> 00:41:44.311
later, these women who were 40
to 45 are now 45 to 50,

00:41:44.311 --> 00:41:46.309
no more fertility,
pretty much.

00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:49.510
In Nigeria they're not using a
lot of IVF and everything.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:53.143
So they have stopped
reproducing but that cohort of

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:57.358
that size is being replaced by
the ones of this size coming

00:41:57.358 --> 00:42:01.001
into fertile ages,
so women that were 10 to 15 are

00:42:01.001 --> 00:42:04.309
becoming 15 to 20 and starting
their childbearing,

00:42:04.309 --> 00:42:07.492
when women that are 40 to 45
which have not so much

00:42:07.492 --> 00:42:10.329
childbearing left,
are going out of existence and

00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:12.030
stopping childbearing
absolutely.

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:15.235
The number of women,
the number of child bearers is

00:42:15.235 --> 00:42:16.840
increasing drastically.
 

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.039
In this case,
it looks ballpark like there

00:42:19.039 --> 00:42:22.150
are twice as many women coming
into reproductive age as are

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:26.554
leaving reproductive age,
each year, each five years

00:42:26.554 --> 00:42:29.780
however you want to count it.
 

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:33.882
The number of childbearing
women is increasing

00:42:33.882 --> 00:42:35.250
tremendously.
 

00:42:35.250 --> 00:42:40.659
The result of that is--here's
another comparison,

00:42:40.659 --> 00:42:44.748
whereas in the west,
in developed countries the

00:42:44.748 --> 00:42:50.079
number of 40 to 45 year olds is
not enormously different then

00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:52.480
the number to 15 to 19.
 

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.541
So the women that are leaving
reproductive ages are more or

00:42:55.541 --> 00:42:58.655
less replaced by the women that
are coming into reproductive

00:42:58.655 --> 00:42:59.130
ages.
 

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.340
Of course with population
decline,

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:05.063
eventually you get fewer women
coming into reproductive age in

00:43:05.063 --> 00:43:07.690
developed countries then are
leaving it,

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.110
so that you have fewer child
bearers,

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:13.963
so this phenomenon can--if your
population is increasing the

00:43:13.963 --> 00:43:16.380
problem gets more and more
severe,

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.940
if it's decreasing the problem
gets more and more severe.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:24.108
There's a positive feedback on
this with your number of child

00:43:24.108 --> 00:43:27.469
bearers either growing or
decreasing.

00:43:27.469 --> 00:43:34.244
Here is in billions--the number
of women of childbearing age in

00:43:34.244 --> 00:43:39.599
the world, and it just keeps
increasing, right?

00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:42.960
What you may be aware of,
I haven't really talked about

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.626
this much yet,
because it's in my next

00:43:45.626 --> 00:43:48.840
lecture, here is the birthrate
in the world,

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:50.599
children per women.
 

00:43:50.599 --> 00:43:53.570
The birthrate has been coming
down.

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:56.960
Two opposite things are
happening in the world.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:01.742
The number of childbearing
women is going up but the number

00:44:01.742 --> 00:44:05.949
of children that each of them
have is going down.

00:44:05.949 --> 00:44:10.141
They predict optimistically
that by 2050 it'll reach about

00:44:10.141 --> 00:44:13.599
replacement of about two
children per women,

00:44:13.599 --> 00:44:16.570
but it's not there,
we're not there yet,

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:25.590
we're almost double-- we're way
above that now.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:29.630
The result of this number of
women rising,

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.559
their rate of childbearing
decreasing is that the number of

00:44:34.559 --> 00:44:36.451
births,
you sort of multiply those two

00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:38.779
out,
the number of births is

00:44:38.779 --> 00:44:44.309
expected to continue increasing
for the predictable future.

00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:49.684
That the absolute number of
births will increase as a result

00:44:49.684 --> 00:44:52.599
of these two crossing factors.
 

00:44:52.599 --> 00:44:56.628
Now the birthrate is coming
down and it eventually,

00:44:56.628 --> 00:45:01.059
let's presume in the future,
gets to be two children.

00:45:01.059 --> 00:45:02.190
What then happens?
 

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:06.981
You still have a pyramid like
this but now it starts

00:45:06.981 --> 00:45:11.114
flattening out,
but it flattens out--I should

00:45:11.114 --> 00:45:13.369
not do this by hand.
 

00:45:13.369 --> 00:45:17.360
In fact I want to go to this
graph.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:21.208
It shows this--this is what's
actually predicted to happen,

00:45:21.208 --> 00:45:24.992
so this is again developing
countries and this is the kind

00:45:24.992 --> 00:45:27.050
of pyramid that we've seen.
 

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:33.489
This one goes back to 1985 with
this broadly increasing thing.

00:45:33.489 --> 00:45:36.603
It's basically a triangle,
you can think of it is as a

00:45:36.603 --> 00:45:37.250
triangle.
 

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:40.085
If immediately,
God sticks his finger out of

00:45:40.085 --> 00:45:43.646
heaven and says two children,
and even more surprising,

00:45:43.646 --> 00:45:45.889
people obey him,
what happens?

00:45:45.889 --> 00:45:49.018
This is the number of children,
people that there are there,

00:45:49.018 --> 00:45:54.827
that the population pyramid
will grow up but with this as a

00:45:54.827 --> 00:45:57.436
base,
so that it will become square

00:45:57.436 --> 00:45:59.679
but there will be this many
people.

00:45:59.679 --> 00:46:04.590
You go from a triangle to a
rectangle with the same base.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:05.119
Can you see that?
 

00:46:05.119 --> 00:46:09.362
The number of people is the
area inside that and you have

00:46:09.362 --> 00:46:11.655
the same base,
you go from a triangle to

00:46:11.655 --> 00:46:14.677
rectangle--
remember from high school

00:46:14.677 --> 00:46:17.420
geometry what the area is?
 

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.239
It doubles.
 

00:46:19.239 --> 00:46:21.833
Because, if you have a triangle
and you go square,

00:46:21.833 --> 00:46:24.800
you just flip that--half the
triangle over and you've got

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.230
that many people again.
 

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:30.789
If a miracle happens and
fertility stops dead right now

00:46:30.789 --> 00:46:34.757
and we go immediately to two
children per woman,

00:46:34.757 --> 00:46:38.809
the population doubles before
it stabilizes.

00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:41.360
What this shows you,
of course is that miracle is

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.530
not going to happen.
 

00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:46.766
This is quite optimistic and is
already not the case,

00:46:46.766 --> 00:46:49.619
that the base will also
increase.

00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:51.949
Since the population is still
increasing,

00:46:51.949 --> 00:46:55.300
the base will increase,
and yes it will get more

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.670
rectangular,
but even by 2025 it won't yet

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:01.125
be rectangular,
so that you will,

00:47:01.125 --> 00:47:06.153
on this kind of projection,
more than double the population

00:47:06.153 --> 00:47:12.340
from 1985 because the base is
growing as well as you're rising

00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:12.949
up.
 

00:47:12.949 --> 00:47:21.280
There's an expectation of quite
a lot of population increase

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.268
left.
 

00:47:22.268 --> 00:47:25.789
This whole phenomenon where
because you--

00:47:25.789 --> 00:47:29.454
once you start having an
increasing population you're

00:47:29.454 --> 00:47:31.472
going to--
the population is going to keep

00:47:31.472 --> 00:47:33.742
increasing because there's more
and more child bearers unless

00:47:33.742 --> 00:47:35.710
something drastic happens to the
fertility rate,

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.739
it's called population momentum
because you're sort of moving in

00:47:38.739 --> 00:47:41.050
a certain direction of
increasing population,

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:42.789
it just continues.
 

00:47:42.789 --> 00:47:46.128
The same thing happens as
you'll see in the next lecture

00:47:46.128 --> 00:47:49.067
with population decreasing,
and when population decreases

00:47:49.067 --> 00:47:51.380
you have fewer and fewer child
bearers in each generation,

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:56.309
as say Japan now or Singapore,
and so unless the birth rate

00:47:56.309 --> 00:48:01.579
increases tremendously you'll
have fewer and fewer children.

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:06.067
What this shows you is that,
if there's immediate

00:48:06.067 --> 00:48:08.501
replacement,
this kind of miracle that

00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:10.704
everything--
that everybody comes to just

00:48:10.704 --> 00:48:14.588
two children immediately,
then the population would be

00:48:14.588 --> 00:48:17.679
this, so this effect is all
momentum.

00:48:17.679 --> 00:48:21.820
All of this increase,
from where we are now to up

00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.009
here,
is just a momentum effect,

00:48:24.009 --> 00:48:27.469
just the fact that there's more
and more children coming into

00:48:27.469 --> 00:48:31.159
reproductive age and that takes
a very long time to work out.

00:48:31.159 --> 00:48:34.686
Then the fact that there's in
fact -- they're not going

00:48:34.686 --> 00:48:38.409
immediately to two children,
not immediate replacement.

00:48:38.409 --> 00:48:41.487
This is the United Nations
guess as to what's going to

00:48:41.487 --> 00:48:42.010
happen.
 

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:45.780
The actual population is
projected to go like this.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:50.635
If everybody immediately goes
to two children you get this

00:48:50.635 --> 00:48:52.170
population rise.
 

00:48:52.170 --> 00:48:55.059
What is actually expected is
somewhat more,

00:48:55.059 --> 00:48:58.985
so huge amount of what's
happening with population future

00:48:58.985 --> 00:49:02.599
is already determined,
it's already momentum is in

00:49:02.599 --> 00:49:06.800
there and even if birthrates
really come down very rapidly,

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:17.768
the world's population is going
to continue increasing.

00:49:17.768 --> 00:49:20.059
That's sort of an important
thing to remember.

00:49:20.059 --> 00:49:27.498
In the world the fertility is
decreasing, the population is

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:33.268
increasing and those are not
canceling out.

00:49:33.268 --> 00:49:36.967
From 1985 the prediction was
that the world population would

00:49:36.967 --> 00:49:39.126
somewhat double,
we've made some progress

00:49:39.126 --> 00:49:42.784
between there,
but still we have 6.7 billion

00:49:42.784 --> 00:49:48.605
now and the expectation is
something like 50% more people

00:49:48.605 --> 00:49:54.530
on earth in 2050 and perhaps
continuing to increase beyond

00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:55.570
that.
 

00:49:55.570 --> 00:50:00.329
Huge amount of momentum
effects, here is--

00:50:00.329 --> 00:50:05.471
let me go back--this is
Mauritius, an island in the

00:50:05.471 --> 00:50:10.715
Indian Ocean and it's one of the
examples of a small

00:50:10.715 --> 00:50:16.679
underdeveloped country that had
a very surprising fertility

00:50:16.679 --> 00:50:18.119
decline.
 

00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:22.661
This is probably the influenza
epidemic here,

00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:28.751
but starting in around--right
after World War II in the late

00:50:28.751 --> 00:50:32.570
1940s, it's death rate fell
down;

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:35.909
modern public health comes in
to Mauritius,

00:50:35.909 --> 00:50:39.010
so the death rate falls
dramatically.

00:50:39.010 --> 00:50:42.422
Then this fits the standard
characterization of the

00:50:42.422 --> 00:50:44.130
demographic transition.
 

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:47.369
About 20 years later,
about one generation later,

00:50:47.369 --> 00:50:49.612
people learn,
well we don't have to have so

00:50:49.612 --> 00:50:51.909
many children because they're
not dying,

00:50:51.909 --> 00:51:01.460
and the birthrate comes down
thereafter and population growth

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.530
is in here.
 

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:07.929
This is a country that did
well, that starting fairly early

00:51:07.929 --> 00:51:11.949
for a developing country,
1951 say, their birthrate is

00:51:11.949 --> 00:51:13.239
falling down.
 

00:51:13.239 --> 00:51:20.324
They really sort of got it
under control and--but look at

00:51:20.324 --> 00:51:21.210
this.
 

00:51:21.210 --> 00:51:29.931
So this is the birth--the total
fertility rate which is a birth

00:51:29.931 --> 00:51:33.733
rate here,
and it stays stable and then it

00:51:33.733 --> 00:51:36.409
starts falling down quite
significantly,

00:51:36.409 --> 00:51:39.760
but look at here's total
population size.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:42.639
You don't even see a change;
all momentum.

00:51:42.639 --> 00:51:48.248
Here the birthrate has started
dropping in 1965 and now we're

00:51:48.248 --> 00:51:53.485
25 years later and you don't see
hardly any change in the

00:51:53.485 --> 00:51:56.010
population growth rate.
 

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:58.994
That's what we talk about by
the momentum effect that because

00:51:58.994 --> 00:52:01.137
at this time,
before they drop their

00:52:01.137 --> 00:52:04.813
fertility, at this time there
were so many more children than

00:52:04.813 --> 00:52:08.489
older people that the number of
women child bearers just kept

00:52:08.489 --> 00:52:11.425
increasing and increasing,
and increasing,

00:52:11.425 --> 00:52:15.202
so even though fertility drops
the number of children stays

00:52:15.202 --> 00:52:17.155
high,
even gets higher,

00:52:17.155 --> 00:52:20.530
and the population just keeps
increasing.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.947
It's a very,
very strong effect and the

00:52:22.947 --> 00:52:25.940
number of--and it's not
flattened out there yet,

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:27.150
25 years later.
 

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:32.260
This is a projection of how
long does it take before it

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.679
flattens out.
 

00:52:33.679 --> 00:52:39.764
This is the first one,
the first box is the year--this

00:52:39.764 --> 00:52:45.619
is our current size as of
whatever year this was.

00:52:45.619 --> 00:52:49.070
By 2030--this is the United
States.

00:52:49.070 --> 00:52:55.840
This is the number of people,
so this graph was made in--

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:59.083
it doesn't say the date but our
population will increase

00:52:59.083 --> 00:53:02.623
somewhat by 2030 and this really
is ignoring the changes that

00:53:02.623 --> 00:53:06.280
have happened with immigration
and so forth that we will--

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.132
we reach two child--if our
fertility comes down we reach

00:53:10.132 --> 00:53:13.846
two child in 2030 and we
stabilize because we have not

00:53:13.846 --> 00:53:17.699
had a rapidly expanding
population so we stabilize right

00:53:17.699 --> 00:53:18.469
away.
 

00:53:18.469 --> 00:53:22.639
Nigeria, which you saw,
current population,

00:53:22.639 --> 00:53:27.110
it's supposed to but some
optimistic assumptions reach two

00:53:27.110 --> 00:53:30.170
children per women in the year
2035,

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:36.090
but then it doesn't stabilize
until 115 years later at again a

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:38.809
much increased population.
 

00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:42.400
In the case of Nigeria,
after it reaches two child per

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.735
woman,
after it reaches replacement

00:53:44.735 --> 00:53:46.869
level,
it takes another 115 years

00:53:46.869 --> 00:53:49.329
before population actually
stabilizes.

00:53:49.329 --> 00:53:51.780
This is Bangladesh, 125 years.
 

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:58.081
This is Iran, 110 years;
Iran has had a big crash,

00:53:58.081 --> 00:54:00.119
we'll talk about that and its
population.

00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:04.893
Brazil 145 years,
it takes an enormous amount of

00:54:04.893 --> 00:54:10.985
time for momentum to work itself
out after the fertility rate

00:54:10.985 --> 00:54:12.510
comes down.
 

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:17.422
It's quite striking,
and that's the reason why we

00:54:17.422 --> 00:54:22.539
expect so much more population
growth to happen.

00:54:22.539 --> 00:54:26.202
Again, you can look at an
individual country,

00:54:26.202 --> 00:54:30.199
and this is Algeria,
and look at what Algeria has

00:54:30.199 --> 00:54:34.780
done between--in 20 years:
that's an enormous rate.

00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.980
Here's its crude birthrate,
it's--crude means not corrected

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:40.871
for age or anything,
just take 1,000 people,

00:54:40.871 --> 00:54:44.400
how many babies were there for
that 1,000 people.

00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:48.416
In 1965 there were 50 and it
dropped to 38,

00:54:48.416 --> 00:54:52.530
a very large drop and it's a
drop of 24%.

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:56.757
They cut their birthrate by a
quarter, that's 25% in 20 years,

00:54:56.757 --> 00:54:59.875
that's more than 1% a year,
so there's a very,

00:54:59.875 --> 00:55:01.400
very rapid change.
 

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:06.525
Because of momentum the
population growth rate was 2.4%

00:55:06.525 --> 00:55:11.271
in 1965 even though the
birthrate is going down the

00:55:11.271 --> 00:55:15.070
population growth rate is going
up,

00:55:15.070 --> 00:55:19.760
all momentum,
and the percent of change that

00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.690
the growth rate increased by
19%,

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:25.510
again all of this,
because at this age,

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:27.030
they had been having a
population explosion,

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:29.590
so many younger children than
older.

00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:34.230
The population almost doubled
from 12 million to 22 million,

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:39.516
population went up 83% and the
annual population growth rate

00:55:39.516 --> 00:55:43.639
increased from a quarter million
to 600,000;

00:55:43.639 --> 00:55:48.809
0.6 million, it changed 217%.
 

00:55:48.809 --> 00:55:50.869
Here's the dilemma for
developing countries,

00:55:50.869 --> 00:55:55.094
that basically all the
developing countries understand

00:55:55.094 --> 00:55:58.492
that they need--
that economically they'll be

00:55:58.492 --> 00:56:02.277
destroyed if their population
growth rate increases and

00:56:02.277 --> 00:56:05.994
virtually every developing
country has now an official

00:56:05.994 --> 00:56:09.989
national policy of trying to get
its birthrate down.

00:56:09.989 --> 00:56:12.619
We'll see later that that's
okay with the people,

00:56:12.619 --> 00:56:15.521
they're generally in accord
with this, and they can do

00:56:15.521 --> 00:56:17.329
wonder--they can do miracles.
 

00:56:17.329 --> 00:56:19.755
These countries--you'll see
some of the drops next time,

00:56:19.755 --> 00:56:22.402
I'll talk about--next time in
my lecture I'll talk about some

00:56:22.402 --> 00:56:23.550
of the fabulous drops.
 

00:56:23.550 --> 00:56:28.126
I mean this is not exceptional,
this is a very significant drop

00:56:28.126 --> 00:56:31.449
but it's not exceptional around
the world,

00:56:31.449 --> 00:56:36.619
and yet, even in the face of
that, their population goes up

00:56:36.619 --> 00:56:40.159
into massive amounts,
83% up, 100% up,

00:56:40.159 --> 00:56:41.909
more than somewhat.
 

00:56:41.909 --> 00:56:45.150
As the government is pushing
modernization,

00:56:45.150 --> 00:56:49.380
and as the government is
pushing reducing the birthrate,

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:53.094
and as grass roots
organizations push to try to get

00:56:53.094 --> 00:56:56.389
the birthrate down,
the population keeps increasing.

00:56:56.389 --> 00:56:59.320
Industrial development,
if it's not extremely rapid,

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:02.257
can't keep up with the
birthrate, so while these

00:57:02.257 --> 00:57:06.320
countries are modernizing they
can see conditions deteriorate,

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.010
poverty can grow,
crowding can grow,

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:12.739
homelessness can grow,
again because population,

00:57:12.739 --> 00:57:16.010
even though you get your
birthrate down,

00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:20.809
your population keeps
increasing so extremely.

00:57:20.809 --> 00:57:25.186
Some theory--believe that
there's kind of a window of

00:57:25.186 --> 00:57:29.309
opportunity for the developing
countries that,

00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:32.480
for instance,
you take Egypt which I'm sure

00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:36.329
it's also had one of these drops
not unlike this.

00:57:36.329 --> 00:57:39.400
They were kings of the world,
top of the world in the

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.760
Pharaoh's time,
you all know that kind of

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.469
history.
 

00:57:42.469 --> 00:57:45.181
Then iron was invented,
but not in Egypt,

00:57:45.181 --> 00:57:49.250
and Egypt was in the bronze age
during the Pharaoh's time.

00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:52.572
Iron is invented maybe in
Turkey, I don't know exactly

00:57:52.572 --> 00:57:56.273
where and the other people's of
the world picked up iron and

00:57:56.273 --> 00:57:57.590
made iron swords.
 

00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:59.099
The Egyptians,
for some reason,

00:57:59.099 --> 00:58:01.652
never really caught onto iron,
maybe they don't have any iron

00:58:01.652 --> 00:58:04.405
anywhere there,
and so from 1000 BC or

00:58:04.405 --> 00:58:10.940
something until 1950 they were
always subject to somebody else.

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:15.445
They were always ruled by
someone else until Nasser got

00:58:15.445 --> 00:58:19.402
rid of the British in 1950,
they were ruled by the British,

00:58:19.402 --> 00:58:21.090
and then before that by the
Turks,

00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:26.280
and by all kinds of peoples,
the Greeks before that--

00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.909
in Alexander the Greats time
and so forth,

00:58:27.909 --> 00:58:29.746
and the Romans,
they were ruled by someone

00:58:29.746 --> 00:58:30.059
else.
 

00:58:30.059 --> 00:58:34.061
Well here come--here's 1952 I
think, Nasser's revolution,

00:58:34.061 --> 00:58:37.420
gets rids of the British,
sets up an independent

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.349
republic.
 

00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:40.394
The people are very
enthusiastic,

00:58:40.394 --> 00:58:43.918
they're very excited,
they now throw off the shackles

00:58:43.918 --> 00:58:46.088
of imperialism,
and colonialism,

00:58:46.088 --> 00:58:48.719
and they can now be their own
country.

00:58:48.719 --> 00:58:53.021
But the birthrate is still very
high, the population growth rate

00:58:53.021 --> 00:58:56.025
is very high,
they have to industrialize real

00:58:56.025 --> 00:58:56.639
fast.
 

00:58:56.639 --> 00:58:59.197
They can't and they don't
industrialize that fast,

00:58:59.197 --> 00:59:01.130
they don't modernize their
economy.

00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.355
Why?
 

00:59:01.355 --> 00:59:04.403
A whole lot of reasons,
one of which is they waste huge

00:59:04.403 --> 00:59:07.170
amounts of money on the conflict
with Israel,

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:10.487
that they have war after war,
and have to spend huge amounts

00:59:10.487 --> 00:59:13.804
of money on the military that
would be better spent on their

00:59:13.804 --> 00:59:15.210
economic development.
 

00:59:15.210 --> 00:59:18.342
Time passes,
and the people have tried to

00:59:18.342 --> 00:59:20.494
modernize,
that's been the ideology,

00:59:20.494 --> 00:59:22.309
they've tried socialist
modernization,

00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:24.900
they've tried capitalist
modernization,

00:59:24.900 --> 00:59:28.440
and what they see is more and
more crowding,

00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.090
poverty is not going away.
 

00:59:30.090 --> 00:59:32.010
Conditions are not getting very
much better.

00:59:32.010 --> 00:59:35.880
I mean they do get a little bit
better, but not terribly much

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.849
better and so they give up on
modernization.

00:59:38.849 --> 00:59:41.608
When they give up on
modernization they glorify the

00:59:41.608 --> 00:59:43.266
past,
they say it was better in the

00:59:43.266 --> 00:59:45.454
past,
and they go to a romantic

00:59:45.454 --> 00:59:48.030
attitude to what it was like
in--

00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:52.422
and can try to reverse
modernization by resisting

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:56.273
further drops in birthrate,
for instance,

00:59:56.273 --> 00:59:58.309
going back to religion.
 

00:59:58.309 --> 01:00:00.429
When I was in Egypt some years
back,

01:00:00.429 --> 01:00:02.726
went into some sort of a
restaurant and they seat you

01:00:02.726 --> 01:00:06.106
sometime at long tables,
so people you don't know you

01:00:06.106 --> 01:00:09.079
sit next to,
and if they happen to speak

01:00:09.079 --> 01:00:12.849
English I could talk to them,
I don't speak Arabic,

01:00:12.849 --> 01:00:17.139
and so the ones that I could
talk to were upper class--

01:00:17.139 --> 01:00:20.076
educated people and therefore
upper class people that spoke

01:00:20.076 --> 01:00:21.190
fairly good English.
 

01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:24.402
And you meet this nice young
woman and she was at the

01:00:24.402 --> 01:00:27.369
University of Cairo which is an
elite school,

01:00:27.369 --> 01:00:29.989
and she was an engineering
student,

01:00:29.989 --> 01:00:32.820
so perfectly intelligent,
perfectly modern in that way,

01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.878
wearing a head scarf,
which her mother did not wear

01:00:35.878 --> 01:00:38.510
which was not in the previous
generation.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:41.768
That she doesn't believe in
modernization basically.

01:00:41.768 --> 01:00:44.291
For her own self-benefit she'll
become an engineer because she

01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:45.159
wants a decent job.
 

01:00:45.159 --> 01:00:49.639
She doesn't want to herself go
back and dig in the desert dirt

01:00:49.639 --> 01:00:51.989
there to try to get some food.
 

01:00:51.989 --> 01:00:54.206
She wants to be a modern person
with a good job,

01:00:54.206 --> 01:00:56.849
at least she wants a good job,
but she doesn't believe in

01:00:56.849 --> 01:00:57.699
modernization.
 

01:00:57.699 --> 01:01:00.681
The rest of her ideology,
aside from her personal

01:01:00.681 --> 01:01:04.347
desires, is backward looking,
that things were better in the

01:01:04.347 --> 01:01:06.768
past, modernization has not
worked.

01:01:06.768 --> 01:01:10.728
This is--there's this window of
opportunity when countries first

01:01:10.728 --> 01:01:14.688
try to get modernized and one of
the things that goes along with

01:01:14.688 --> 01:01:17.579
modernization is a reduced
fertility rate.

01:01:17.579 --> 01:01:20.679
If it doesn't work people will
reject that.

01:01:20.679 --> 01:01:24.840
A lot of what's going on in the
world today with respect to the

01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:27.659
developed and underdeveloped
countries,

01:01:27.659 --> 01:01:29.949
and the Arab countries,
and the Western countries,

01:01:29.949 --> 01:01:35.041
has to do with this rejection
of modernization because it did

01:01:35.041 --> 01:01:36.739
not work for them.
 

01:01:36.739 --> 01:01:38.880
With that, if the birthrate
stays high as it has,

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.219
not in the Muslim countries.
 

01:01:40.219 --> 01:01:43.239
Many Muslim countries have had
fabulous progress,

01:01:43.239 --> 01:01:45.681
but in a lot of the Arab
countries the birthrate has

01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:48.632
stayed very high,
and there's these huge numbers

01:01:48.632 --> 01:01:52.081
of unemployed young men,
the economy cannot absorb them,

01:01:52.081 --> 01:01:56.289
they're hanging around,
they're idealistic as all young

01:01:56.289 --> 01:01:59.978
men are,
and what ideals do they pick up

01:01:59.978 --> 01:02:05.000
but going back to some imagined
past that was glorious.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.780
The world may hinge on this
window of opportunity.

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.719
How many countries can take
advantage of it?

01:02:09.719 --> 01:02:12.409
China clearly took advantage of
it, Japan took advantage of it.

01:02:12.409 --> 01:02:14.532
A lot of the East Asian
countries took advantage of

01:02:14.532 --> 01:02:17.809
their window of opportunity,
a lot of other countries did

01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:21.380
not take advantage of their
window of opportunity.

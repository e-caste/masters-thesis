00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.930
Prof: For the last three
weeks,

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.811
then, we've been going through
some of the major developments

00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:10.369
in terms of political and
religious change in the course

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:14.676
of the sixteenth century,
and for the next three weeks

00:00:14.676 --> 00:00:19.410
we'll be looking at other
aspects of what was going on in

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
the reign of Elizabeth and under
the early Stuarts,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.507
dealing with a number of themes
that run across from about 1560

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:32.740
to 1640 and then we'll return to
the political narrative.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.940
So I'm going to look at things
like witchcraft and crime and

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.140
popular protest and education
and the growth of literacy.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.641
But first of all this week,
in order to understand all of

00:00:44.641 --> 00:00:48.080
these developments and create
the context of change,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.710
we need to know what was going
on in economy and society,

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.662
both of which were changing in
their structure quite

00:00:55.662 --> 00:00:58.904
significantly in these two
generations at the turn of the

00:00:58.904 --> 00:01:01.219
sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.319
And today I'll focus on the
economic developments.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:07.700
So, a bit of economic history.
 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.195
Economic history is rarely
immensely popular but it does

00:01:14.195 --> 00:01:15.260
matter.
 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.209
It's absolutely basic.
 

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.549
It's perhaps an unfamiliar kind
of history.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.959
It's mostly done in economics
departments,

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.010
but what I'll try to do
basically is to give you a clear

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.912
overview of what we know about
what seems to have been

00:01:30.912 --> 00:01:35.110
happening in this period and
your handout will provide you

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.308
with some statistics to chart
the overall developments and

00:01:39.308 --> 00:01:42.180
illustrate some of the details.
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.250
Okay.
 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.489
So by the 1560s already,
as you know,

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.807
population growth and price
inflation had impacted to some

00:01:51.807 --> 00:01:55.971
degree upon established patterns
of social relationships

00:01:55.971 --> 00:02:00.290
especially on the land between
landlords and tenants.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.156
In this situation there was
need for sustained economic

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:07.953
expansion if a growing
population was to be maintained

00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:12.322
and in particular if the younger
generation were to be able to

00:02:12.322 --> 00:02:16.294
find employment,
to enjoy living standards

00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:19.919
comparable to those of their
parents,

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:24.381
and such expansion needed to be
considerable if it was to keep

00:02:24.381 --> 00:02:27.158
pace with continued population
rise.

00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:29.729
If you look at your handout,
table number one there,

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:33.264
we have the best figures
available for population showing

00:02:33.264 --> 00:02:36.800
that by the beginning of
Elizabeth's reign in 1561 it had

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.389
already reached about three
million,

00:02:39.389 --> 00:02:42.180
by 1601 it had topped four
million,

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:50.400
and by 1641 the population had
risen to just over five million.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.835
In fact, the population in
England seems to have been

00:02:53.835 --> 00:02:57.601
rising faster and for rather
longer than was generally the

00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:59.650
case in Europe at the time.
 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.716
Between the 1520s and the
1640s, the population of England

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:07.211
and Wales roughly doubled
whereas in most European

00:03:07.211 --> 00:03:10.232
countries which--
continental European

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:14.496
countries--which have been
studied the rise was something

00:03:14.496 --> 00:03:15.408
like 50%.
 

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:19.685
That suggests that whatever the
population rise in England had

00:03:19.685 --> 00:03:23.610
in common with what was going on
elsewhere in Europe,

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.097
perhaps in terms of its
origins, it was nonetheless

00:03:28.097 --> 00:03:32.590
being sustained rather longer,
perhaps because of factors

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.650
peculiar to the English
situation.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.867
There seems to have been a
capacity to absorb increased

00:03:38.867 --> 00:03:43.633
numbers of people to a somewhat
greater extent than in much of

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:45.430
continental Europe.
 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.776
And that this could happen at
all is of course an indication

00:03:49.776 --> 00:03:54.270
that some kind of economic
expansion was probably going on.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.413
And so the question arises and
has been extensively

00:03:58.413 --> 00:04:03.552
investigated as to what were the
areas of economic expansion in

00:04:03.552 --> 00:04:04.878
this period.
 

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:09.364
Well, in a predominantly rural
society, of course,

00:04:09.364 --> 00:04:12.658
we need to begin with
agriculture.

00:04:12.658 --> 00:04:15.686
And if you look at table two on
your handout,

00:04:15.686 --> 00:04:19.399
2(a), there's an index there of
agricultural output.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.959
It's the best estimate
currently available,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.160
calculated by the agricultural
historian Mark Overton,

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.154
and it suggests that grain
output rose by about 38% in

00:04:32.154 --> 00:04:38.603
England between 1550 and 1600
and by a further 26% between

00:04:38.603 --> 00:04:40.639
1600 and 1650.
 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.961
Over the entire period
something like a 75% increase in

00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:47.440
grain output.
 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.500
Well, how did they achieve that?
 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.000
One thing they did was to
extend the cultivated area.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.579
In fact, very little land was
not used at all so really this

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:05.238
was largely a matter of changing
the use of the land so as to

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:08.189
increase the intensity of its
use.

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.129
They did that in many ways.
 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.571
One way was by clearing
woodlands and bringing the

00:05:13.571 --> 00:05:15.959
woodland into arable production.
 

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:20.036
A good deal of that went on in
the heavily wooded areas of the

00:05:20.036 --> 00:05:23.110
West Midlands here,
and elsewhere piecemeal.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.363
Another thing they did was to
drain waterlogged land and to

00:05:28.363 --> 00:05:30.990
reclaim it for agriculture.
 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.735
There was a good deal of that
going on piecemeal around the

00:05:33.735 --> 00:05:34.209
country.
 

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.533
Down here in eastern England
for example a lot of salt marsh

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:40.069
along the coast was brought in
permanently.

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.730
They built dikes so that it
wouldn't flood and drained it,

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:47.470
much in the manner that was
practiced in the Netherlands,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:53.569
of course, and brought that
land into permanent pasture use.

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.019
A lot of wasteland was plowed
up and brought into cultivation.

00:05:58.019 --> 00:06:00.745
There was a lot of piecemeal
change of that kind wherever

00:06:00.745 --> 00:06:03.928
wasteland was available,
but there were also some very

00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:07.216
large projects of that kind
which were sponsored and

00:06:07.216 --> 00:06:09.730
overseen by the royal privy
council.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.096
In the west of England a lot of
forested land was

00:06:13.096 --> 00:06:18.569
'disafforested' by the crown;
that is its status as forest

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:20.810
land was canceled.
 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.189
Woodlands were cleared.
 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.350
Land was brought into
cultivation all over the west.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.639
Another major scheme was in the
fenlands of East Anglia.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:34.444
The fens were from the 1620s
onwards gradually drained and

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:37.899
that land was brought into
cultivation.

00:06:37.899 --> 00:06:41.422
Dutch engineers were brought in
because of their expertise in

00:06:41.422 --> 00:06:43.125
draining land,
building dikes,

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:45.180
drainage channels and so forth.
 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.985
It's because of that drainage
which took place in the

00:06:47.985 --> 00:06:51.276
seventeenth century that if you
drive through that area you'll

00:06:51.276 --> 00:06:54.300
find the roads are higher than
the surrounding land.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.377
Well, much change then of this
kind going on,

00:06:57.377 --> 00:07:01.223
and this tended to recast the
balance between arable and

00:07:01.223 --> 00:07:04.720
pastoral production in the
kingdom as a whole.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:09.771
It also furthered increased
specialization in accordance

00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:12.709
with the best use of the land.
 

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:15.149
In the forest of Arden,
for example,

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:19.956
in Warwickshire an area which
was previously largely an area

00:07:19.956 --> 00:07:24.925
of grazing in forest clearances
much of the forest was cleared

00:07:24.925 --> 00:07:29.488
and the land went over from meat
production to arable and

00:07:29.488 --> 00:07:30.709
dairying.
 

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:35.165
Amongst the arable crops they
began growing more barley as

00:07:35.165 --> 00:07:38.370
well as wheat to diversify the
product.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.149
They generally increased the
food base of the area.

00:07:41.149 --> 00:07:44.744
They were producing milk and
cheese and grain as well as

00:07:44.744 --> 00:07:48.141
meat, and you get other areas
where there's even more

00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:49.449
diversification.
 

00:07:49.449 --> 00:07:52.529
Down in Kent to the southeast
of London.

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:56.172
Northern Kent became an area
specializing in producing wheat

00:07:56.172 --> 00:07:57.839
for the bakers of London.
 

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:00.636
Other areas of the county
specialized in fattening cattle

00:08:00.636 --> 00:08:03.781
which were driven down from the
north, fattened up and then went

00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:05.079
to butchers in London.
 

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:07.661
There were areas specializing
in hop production,

00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:10.300
as there still are,
for the brewers of London;

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:16.259
areas specializing in market
gardening for the city.

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:19.156
Proximity to the vast food
market of London,

00:08:19.156 --> 00:08:22.660
of course, encouraged
specialization of that kind.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:27.838
And such specialization in
various parts of the kingdom in

00:08:27.838 --> 00:08:32.288
turn encouraged intensification
of cultivation.

00:08:32.288 --> 00:08:36.173
Sometimes that was by
introducing technical changes in

00:08:36.173 --> 00:08:38.080
agricultural production.
 

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.705
There was a lot of attention
paid to better forms of manuring

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:45.908
the land,
not just using animal muck but

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:50.389
also spreading lime on the
fields or 'marling' the fields.

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:53.009
Marl is a kind of chalky clay.
 

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:56.828
They would dig it up and spread
it on the fields and then plow

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:57.330
it in.
 

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.674
Techniques of that kind had the
effect of reducing the acidity

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:05.948
of the soil and they encouraged
nitrogen mineralization which

00:09:05.948 --> 00:09:08.870
encouraged the fertility of the
soil.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.543
They didn't know the chemistry
of what was happening,

00:09:12.543 --> 00:09:16.782
but they knew that it worked
and techniques of this kind were

00:09:16.782 --> 00:09:18.690
quite widely practiced.
 

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.860
There were also technical
changes in the form of changing

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.254
rotations in the use of land
between having it down to grass

00:09:27.254 --> 00:09:30.158
or plowing it up for arable
crops,

00:09:30.158 --> 00:09:34.054
in particular an innovation
which is known as convertible

00:09:34.054 --> 00:09:37.774
husbandry,
or up and down husbandry,

00:09:37.774 --> 00:09:40.139
it was often called.
 

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:43.615
Previously, the practice had
been in the great open fields

00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:47.029
around villages to leave one of
them fallow each year.

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:51.436
It would be rested for a single
year and then brought back into

00:09:51.436 --> 00:09:52.360
production.
 

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.624
Convertible husbandry was a
much more efficient form of

00:09:55.624 --> 00:09:56.288
rotation.
 

00:09:56.288 --> 00:09:58.879
You would leave the grass--the
land down to grass for quite a

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.879
long time,
ten years, twelve years

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:04.633
perhaps, then plow it up for
just two or three years and then

00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:06.509
put it down to grass again.
 

00:10:06.509 --> 00:10:10.527
The effect of this change in
rotation was that the land

00:10:10.527 --> 00:10:13.278
was--got its heart restored
better.

00:10:13.278 --> 00:10:17.767
You got greatly improved cereal
yields when it was plowed up for

00:10:17.767 --> 00:10:19.980
arable,
but at the same time you had

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.820
more of your acreage down to
grass at any one time,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.600
so you could keep more animals.
 

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:29.062
So they could increase both
their output of grain and the

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:32.649
density of the livestock which
they raised.

00:10:32.649 --> 00:10:35.397
This practice,
up and down or convertible

00:10:35.397 --> 00:10:38.663
husbandry,
had long been known in some

00:10:38.663 --> 00:10:43.586
areas but it gradually spread as
a particularly efficient

00:10:43.586 --> 00:10:47.345
practice,
and it spreads all over lowland

00:10:47.345 --> 00:10:51.308
England between about the 1580s
and the 1650s.

00:10:51.308 --> 00:10:55.085
And finally,
change of all these kinds could

00:10:55.085 --> 00:11:00.441
be facilitated by enclosing the
land into individually managed

00:11:00.441 --> 00:11:01.320
farms.
 

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.647
As you know,
in the sixteenth century

00:11:03.647 --> 00:11:07.721
there'd been great hostility to
enclosure for pasture which took

00:11:07.721 --> 00:11:09.918
land out of arable production.
 

00:11:09.918 --> 00:11:12.633
In the late sixteenth century,
partly because of this

00:11:12.633 --> 00:11:15.524
hostility to enclosure,
the enclosure movement

00:11:15.524 --> 00:11:19.783
slackened, but at the turn of
the seventeenth century it began

00:11:19.783 --> 00:11:21.178
to pick up again.
 

00:11:21.178 --> 00:11:24.950
In the central England county
of Leicestershire in the--

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.663
what people refer to as the
Midland Plain of central

00:11:27.663 --> 00:11:29.283
England,
for example,

00:11:29.283 --> 00:11:34.710
about a third of the county had
already been enclosed by 1550.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.482
In the second half of the
sixteenth century,

00:11:37.482 --> 00:11:39.289
only 5% more was enclosed.
 

00:11:39.289 --> 00:11:41.058
The movement slackened.
 

00:11:41.058 --> 00:11:44.902
But in the early seventeenth
century it picked up again and

00:11:44.902 --> 00:11:47.418
40% more of the county was
enclosed.

00:11:47.418 --> 00:11:50.519
Similar figures have been
produced for other areas

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:52.480
particularly in the Midlands.
 

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.879
Well, this second wave of
enclosure,

00:11:54.879 --> 00:11:58.667
of dividing up the fields and
common into smaller fields

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:01.936
individually managed,
it was different in two

00:12:01.936 --> 00:12:05.168
respects from the earlier
enclosure movement.

00:12:05.168 --> 00:12:07.852
First of all,
it was now not so much

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:12.222
enclosure for conversion to
pasture, especially conversion

00:12:12.222 --> 00:12:13.908
to sheep ranching.
 

00:12:13.908 --> 00:12:18.525
Now it tended to be enclosure
for the practice of improved

00:12:18.525 --> 00:12:22.090
arable husbandry or convertible
husbandry.

00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.400
When the forests of the west
were cleared and the fens of the

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:28.049
east were drained,
the land brought into

00:12:28.049 --> 00:12:32.309
production tended to be divided
up into individual fields and

00:12:32.309 --> 00:12:36.640
then let out to local farmers
where they practiced convertible

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.408
husbandry in their enclosed
farms.

00:12:39.408 --> 00:12:42.940
Secondly, this differed because
it was not a thing which was

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.649
just pushed through unilaterally
by the local gentry who wanted

00:12:46.649 --> 00:12:50.178
to create sheep ranches in the
early sixteenth century.

00:12:50.178 --> 00:12:53.899
Now it was a movement which
tended to proceed by agreement--

00:12:53.899 --> 00:12:56.729
agreements which would be
struck between local gentlemen

00:12:56.729 --> 00:13:00.687
and the principal local farmers,
their biggest tenants in the

00:13:00.687 --> 00:13:01.149
main.
 

00:13:01.149 --> 00:13:05.018
And so you find all over the
kingdom local communities coming

00:13:05.018 --> 00:13:08.950
to agreements of this kind to
enclose the common fields or the

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.240
common pastures.
 

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.753
To take just one example,
there's a village up in the

00:13:12.753 --> 00:13:16.168
West Midlands called Highley,
which has been much studied,

00:13:16.168 --> 00:13:19.044
and it has excellent records,
and at Highley,

00:13:19.044 --> 00:13:21.140
for example,
it was in the 1610s and the

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.042
1620s that the open fields of
the parish were gradually

00:13:24.042 --> 00:13:26.460
enclosed little by little by
agreement,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.778
and then they rounded the whole
thing off by dividing up and

00:13:30.778 --> 00:13:35.389
portioning out the woodlands and
common pasture of the manor.

00:13:35.389 --> 00:13:39.312
The whole idea of this was to
create consolidated farms which

00:13:39.312 --> 00:13:42.909
would be under the individual
management of a particular

00:13:42.909 --> 00:13:43.629
farmer.
 

00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:49.556
That gave those farmers freedom
of movement in managing and

00:13:49.556 --> 00:13:54.870
adapting their husbandry
practice as they saw fit.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:58.572
Intensification of methods was
not impossible in the old open

00:13:58.572 --> 00:14:01.562
fields,
but it was much easier on farms

00:14:01.562 --> 00:14:05.878
under individual management,
and in consequence the old

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:10.457
communally managed customary
system of agriculture gradually

00:14:10.457 --> 00:14:11.389
weakened.
 

00:14:11.389 --> 00:14:13.711
It weakened its hold on
agricultural organization

00:14:13.711 --> 00:14:16.115
generally,
survived in some areas,

00:14:16.115 --> 00:14:19.822
but in many parts of the
country it was gradually

00:14:19.822 --> 00:14:24.610
disappearing and in some it was
almost wholly extinguished.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:25.860
Right.
 

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:30.754
Overall, various combinations
of changes of this kind appear

00:14:30.754 --> 00:14:35.070
to have boosted agricultural
output considerably,

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:40.466
even boosting the yields per
acre, the productivity of the

00:14:40.466 --> 00:14:41.129
land.
 

00:14:41.129 --> 00:14:44.320
The study which is represented
by the figures on two--

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.522
table 2(b)--on your handout of
land productivity in a number of

00:14:49.522 --> 00:14:52.366
counties,
a study based upon farmers'

00:14:52.366 --> 00:14:55.123
inventories--
the crops that are recorded in

00:14:55.123 --> 00:14:58.788
their inventories and also on
some surviving account books--

00:14:58.788 --> 00:15:03.710
this suggests that in these
counties cereal yields,

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:08.732
numbers of bushels per acre,
rose by about 15% in the late

00:15:08.732 --> 00:15:13.932
sixteenth century and by another
4% in the early seventeenth

00:15:13.932 --> 00:15:14.990
century.
 

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.649
Okay.
 

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:21.452
Well, gradual change of this
kind in agriculture implies that

00:15:21.452 --> 00:15:26.254
there existed a larger market
for agricultural produce and in

00:15:26.254 --> 00:15:31.057
some ways a more distant market
for agricultural produce that

00:15:31.057 --> 00:15:33.860
farmers were trying to serve.
 

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.250
And those markets were found,
as you would imagine,

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:41.578
above all in the towns and in
those areas of the countryside

00:15:41.578 --> 00:15:45.908
which had large populations
which were engaged in activities

00:15:45.908 --> 00:15:50.803
other than agriculture;
industrial areas of the

00:15:50.803 --> 00:15:52.450
countryside.
 

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:56.388
This was a period of very
marked urbanization,

00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:59.190
very significant urban growth.
 

00:15:59.190 --> 00:16:03.452
Some of the figures are there
on table three on your handout

00:16:03.452 --> 00:16:05.259
for a number of cities.
 

00:16:05.259 --> 00:16:07.215
In Worcester,
for example,

00:16:07.215 --> 00:16:11.517
the population rose between
1550 and 1650 from just over

00:16:11.517 --> 00:16:13.629
4,000 to roughly 8,000.
 

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:19.692
In Norwich the population of
the city rose from about 10,000

00:16:19.692 --> 00:16:21.440
to over 30,000.
 

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:27.126
And above all there was massive
population growth in the city of

00:16:27.126 --> 00:16:27.940
London.
 

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.090
The figures are there for you.
 

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:35.942
In 1550, London was already
about 70,000,

00:16:35.942 --> 00:16:41.942
by 1600 200,000,
by 1650 400,000 and still

00:16:41.942 --> 00:16:43.700
growing.
 

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:49.149
By 1600, London already
contained 5% of the national

00:16:49.149 --> 00:16:50.538
population.
 

00:16:50.538 --> 00:16:55.970
By 1650, London contained just
over 9% of the national

00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:01.399
population and was still
growing, and today it's about

00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:02.220
10%.
 

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.029
It had almost reached that
proportion in the

00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:06.730
mid-seventeenth century.
 

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:11.940
So very significant urban
growth.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.259
All of that involved,
within particular cities,

00:17:15.259 --> 00:17:20.160
the taking up of vacant space
within their walls for building,

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:25.073
the subdivision of existing
housing and the growth of

00:17:25.073 --> 00:17:28.568
suburbs outside the old city
walls.

00:17:28.568 --> 00:17:31.367
In London, for example,
by the 1580s there were

00:17:31.367 --> 00:17:34.652
complaints by the local
authorities of what they called

00:17:34.652 --> 00:17:37.815
"pestering of houses with
diverse families"

00:17:37.815 --> 00:17:39.578
or multiple occupation.
 

00:17:39.578 --> 00:17:41.440
Or again "multitudes of
people"--

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.574
these are
quotations--"multitudes of

00:17:43.574 --> 00:17:46.190
people brought to inhabit in
small rooms and...

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:50.823
heaped up together and in a
sort almost smothered,"

00:17:50.823 --> 00:17:52.339
said one report.
 

00:17:52.339 --> 00:17:55.788
Overcrowding;
congestion.

00:17:55.788 --> 00:17:58.346
In addition,
in the parishes outside the

00:17:58.346 --> 00:18:01.690
city walls there was significant
suburban growth.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:05.806
The parishes of east London,
to the east of the Tower of

00:18:05.806 --> 00:18:09.998
London, the modern East End,
in the 1570s contained about

00:18:09.998 --> 00:18:11.868
7,000 people already.
 

00:18:11.868 --> 00:18:14.746
So there was already a
significant population in these

00:18:14.746 --> 00:18:17.078
parishes just outside the old
city walls.

00:18:17.078 --> 00:18:21.519
By the 1630s,
there were 50,000 people in the

00:18:21.519 --> 00:18:23.740
east London suburbs.
 

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:27.275
Or if we turn to western London
the parish of St.

00:18:27.275 --> 00:18:30.736
Martin-in-the-Fields,
which was literally in the

00:18:30.736 --> 00:18:34.787
fields in the mid-sixteenth
century, had a population of

00:18:34.787 --> 00:18:38.470
about 600 when Elizabeth came to
the throne.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:39.858
By the 1630s,
St.

00:18:39.858 --> 00:18:43.160
Martin's had a population of
18,000.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.891
So this single London suburban
parish contained more people

00:18:47.891 --> 00:18:52.460
than most of the cities in other
parts of the kingdom.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.695
The Church of St.
 

00:18:53.695 --> 00:18:57.990
Martin-in-the-Fields is the one
that stands beside Trafalgar

00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.410
Square today right in the heart
of the city.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:07.189
Well, this formidable urban
growth occurred despite alarming

00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:12.771
levels of urban mortality in the
overcrowded, increasingly

00:19:12.771 --> 00:19:14.828
insanitary towns.
 

00:19:14.828 --> 00:19:16.788
They didn't have adequate water
supply.

00:19:16.788 --> 00:19:20.920
They didn't have adequate
sanitation measures.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.105
'Background mortality',
ordinary, everyday mortality

00:19:24.105 --> 00:19:27.165
from infectious disease in the
towns was very bad,

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:29.538
far worse than in the
countryside.

00:19:29.538 --> 00:19:32.568
Even within the cities it could
vary quite significantly.

00:19:32.568 --> 00:19:36.154
For example,
in the late sixteenth century

00:19:36.154 --> 00:19:41.311
average life expectation at
birth in the wealthier districts

00:19:41.311 --> 00:19:44.808
of London was thirty to
thirty-five.

00:19:44.808 --> 00:19:50.364
Average life expectation of
birth in the poorer parishes of

00:19:50.364 --> 00:19:54.769
the East End was only twenty to
twenty-five.

00:19:54.769 --> 00:19:58.300
The towns were also prone,
of course, to catastrophic

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.036
'crisis morality' in the form of
epidemics, particularly

00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:04.210
epidemics of bubonic plague.
 

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:09.182
Norwich saw five major
epidemics of bubonic plague

00:20:09.182 --> 00:20:11.618
between 1579 and 1640.
 

00:20:11.618 --> 00:20:17.852
London also saw five in the
same period and most other major

00:20:17.852 --> 00:20:20.808
cities witnessed a number.
 

00:20:20.808 --> 00:20:26.301
These outbreaks could kill
10-15% of the population or even

00:20:26.301 --> 00:20:27.058
worse.
 

00:20:27.058 --> 00:20:30.900
In York in 1604,
which was a really bad year,

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:33.440
when the plague spread from
city to city across the

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.200
kingdom--
in York in that year roughly

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.400
30% of the population died.
 

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:44.429
In Newcastle up here in the
northeast in 1636 an estimated

00:20:44.429 --> 00:20:50.458
47% of the population died
between May and October of that

00:20:50.458 --> 00:20:51.410
year.
 

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:56.023
These were absolutely
devastating events and they were

00:20:56.023 --> 00:20:59.593
at their worst in the poorer,
overcrowded,

00:20:59.593 --> 00:21:02.380
dirtier areas of the cities.
 

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.992
It's been said by Paul Slack,
who's written a wonderful book

00:21:04.992 --> 00:21:08.382
about the impact of the plague,
that there was a "distinct

00:21:08.382 --> 00:21:10.690
urban topography"
of the plague.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:15.612
The disease was no respecter of
persons, but it raged at its

00:21:15.612 --> 00:21:18.950
worst under certain social
conditions.

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:25.186
And yet despite these appalling
catastrophes the towns continued

00:21:25.186 --> 00:21:27.960
to grow, London above all.
 

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.125
One of the earliest
demographers,

00:21:30.125 --> 00:21:34.117
a man named John Graunt who
published a study based upon the

00:21:34.117 --> 00:21:38.042
mortality figures for London
which were regularly collected

00:21:38.042 --> 00:21:42.171
by the city authorities to keep
an eye on the epidemic disease

00:21:42.171 --> 00:21:43.390
situation.
 

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.538
He studied them for the first
time.

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:48.930
He made various projections on
the basis of those figures.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.400
He was a great pioneer of the
use of statistical information.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.720
He came to the conclusion--I'm
quoting him--

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.098
"let the mortality be what
it will,

00:21:58.098 --> 00:22:02.210
this city repairs itself within
two years."

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.200
The loss of inhabitants could
be rapidly replaced.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:11.002
And the evidence is that this
was so, and of course the loss

00:22:11.002 --> 00:22:15.154
was replaced primarily by
continued migration to the

00:22:15.154 --> 00:22:15.970
towns.
 

00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:20.532
It's been calculated that in
order to replace the numbers who

00:22:20.532 --> 00:22:24.488
died under these dreadful
mortality conditions and to

00:22:24.488 --> 00:22:29.278
continue to grow in the way that
it did London needed an average

00:22:29.278 --> 00:22:33.690
of 6,000 new people a year
coming in to the city to replace

00:22:33.690 --> 00:22:35.818
its losses and grow.
 

00:22:35.818 --> 00:22:40.078
And the evidence is that they
came.

00:22:40.078 --> 00:22:44.181
Some of them came as what one
demographer describes as

00:22:44.181 --> 00:22:48.979
"betterment migrants,"
people who came to the city in

00:22:48.979 --> 00:22:53.390
fairly confident expectation of
better opportunities.

00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:55.946
They might come in as
apprentices to be apprenticed to

00:22:55.946 --> 00:22:58.167
a particular trade,
their apprenticeship having

00:22:58.167 --> 00:23:00.338
been arranged by members of
their family.

00:23:00.338 --> 00:23:04.450
They might be people who came
in with a known place to fill.

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.290
Very often for example they
might have relatives already in

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:10.230
the city who would encourage
their migration to join them.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:14.214
A very interesting study by
Vivien Brodsky of single women

00:23:14.214 --> 00:23:18.411
marrying for the first time in
London and taking out licenses

00:23:18.411 --> 00:23:20.821
to marry,
which give us some details of

00:23:20.821 --> 00:23:23.680
their circumstances,
she finds, interestingly,

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.141
that two fifths of these single
women marrying in London had kin

00:23:28.141 --> 00:23:32.318
in the city with whom they were
living at the time that they

00:23:32.318 --> 00:23:33.240
married.
 

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.900
So they'd come in from the
countryside,

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.058
they were living with family
members already in the city,

00:23:38.058 --> 00:23:43.519
and then they established
themselves and married there.

00:23:43.519 --> 00:23:47.317
Other people came not as
betterment migrants with good

00:23:47.317 --> 00:23:51.328
prospects of that kind but as
what have been described as

00:23:51.328 --> 00:23:53.622
"subsistence
migrants,"

00:23:53.622 --> 00:23:57.203
people looking for any
opportunity to find work and

00:23:57.203 --> 00:24:00.500
hoping that the city would
provide it.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.569
And clearly it did,
perhaps not the opportunities

00:24:03.569 --> 00:24:06.564
that people hoped for--
the streets of London were

00:24:06.564 --> 00:24:10.363
certainly not paved with gold--
but opportunities of a kind,

00:24:10.363 --> 00:24:12.670
to make a living of some kind.
 

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.693
The quickening urban economies
of other cities also did the

00:24:16.693 --> 00:24:17.180
same.
 

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:21.519
In Colchester and in Norwich,
for example,

00:24:21.519 --> 00:24:25.373
the cloth industry was
expanding, particularly with the

00:24:25.373 --> 00:24:28.298
help of refugees from the
Netherlands,

00:24:28.298 --> 00:24:30.098
from the religious wars of the
Netherlands,

00:24:30.098 --> 00:24:33.433
who came and were placed in
those cities by Elizabeth's

00:24:33.433 --> 00:24:37.323
government and who were welcomed
because they introduced certain

00:24:37.323 --> 00:24:39.670
advanced cloth-making
techniques,

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:44.050
which helped to improve the
local cloth industry and assist

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:45.259
its expansion.
 

00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:50.640
In London above all you get a
spectacular diversification of

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.920
manufacturing activity.
 

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.400
In east London along the river
there were shipyards.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.300
There were also businesses
producing all sorts of other

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:05.420
goods ancillary to the shipping
industry: rope making,

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.400
sail making,
coopers making barrels,

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.825
people making pulleys,
pulley makers for the ropes

00:25:13.825 --> 00:25:17.740
that held--
for the rigging of the ships.

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:21.214
In London you also find
textiles, especially luxury

00:25:21.214 --> 00:25:24.048
textiles,
a massive brewing industry,

00:25:24.048 --> 00:25:26.380
metal trades,
sugar refining,

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.740
starch making,
soap making,

00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:31.848
glass making,
and so one could go.

00:25:31.848 --> 00:25:36.512
And then of course there was
all the activity around the

00:25:36.512 --> 00:25:41.516
wharves and the river in what
was England's greatest trading

00:25:41.516 --> 00:25:42.279
city.
 

00:25:42.279 --> 00:25:45.130
So urban economies were
expanding.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.944
The numbers of apprentices
being taken on were growing,

00:25:48.944 --> 00:25:52.336
the level of activity was
growing, the activities

00:25:52.336 --> 00:25:54.740
themselves were proliferating.
 

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:59.374
But manufacturing in other
industries also extended well

00:25:59.374 --> 00:26:01.058
beyond the cities.
 

00:26:01.058 --> 00:26:04.972
Manufacturing of some products
had long been established in

00:26:04.972 --> 00:26:08.278
rural villages under the
'putting out' system,

00:26:08.278 --> 00:26:13.000
and this period also witnessed
considerable growth in

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.358
activities of this kind.
 

00:26:15.358 --> 00:26:19.045
It rarely involved really
significant technological change

00:26:19.045 --> 00:26:22.858
of the kind that we associate
with the industrial revolution

00:26:22.858 --> 00:26:25.509
and the birth of the factory
system,

00:26:25.509 --> 00:26:28.630
but what it often saw was the
adoption,

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.291
or the imitation,
of the best practices known at

00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:37.279
the time and the diversification
of the products which were being

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:40.880
produced,
and there was also something of

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:45.413
a spread in the geographical
location of various kinds of

00:26:45.413 --> 00:26:47.519
manufacturing activity.
 

00:26:47.519 --> 00:26:50.903
As you know,
the premier traditional

00:26:50.903 --> 00:26:55.930
industry was the production of
woolen broadcloth,

00:26:55.930 --> 00:26:59.651
most of it exported to the
Netherlands where traditionally

00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:03.700
it was finished and then passed
on to markets across Europe.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.403
This traditional industry had
had something of a crisis of

00:27:07.403 --> 00:27:11.040
overproduction in the 1550s and
thereafter found that its

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.380
markets were somewhat declining.
 

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.111
Its overseas markets were
somewhat declining and it faced

00:27:17.111 --> 00:27:19.910
pretty stiff competition from
the Dutch.

00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:23.088
But the textile industries
continued to expand nonetheless.

00:27:23.088 --> 00:27:26.480
The most dynamic areas of
textiles were not the old

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.344
broadcloth industry but the
production of what they called

00:27:30.344 --> 00:27:32.650
the "new draperies."
 

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:34.240
The new draperies.
 

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.284
These were lighter,
fully finished,

00:27:37.284 --> 00:27:42.029
more colorful cloths rather
like modern suit cloth.

00:27:42.029 --> 00:27:45.559
If old--if the old broadcloths
were rather like a heavy

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:47.420
blanket,
then if you imagine modern

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.920
suiting cloths that's what the
new draperies were like,

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.920
worsteds of various kinds.
 

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.348
They had lovely names for them.
 

00:27:53.348 --> 00:27:57.692
They were always inventing
fancy names for these new

00:27:57.692 --> 00:28:02.460
cloths: Bays and Says and
Perpetuanas and Calimancoes.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:08.190
All of these were different
forms of worsted cloth.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:12.107
The new draperies were centered
in the towns of East Anglia

00:28:12.107 --> 00:28:16.296
where they had been- where their
establishment had been greatly

00:28:16.296 --> 00:28:19.673
assisted by the influx of
skilled refugees from the

00:28:19.673 --> 00:28:20.890
Netherlands.
 

00:28:20.890 --> 00:28:25.722
They brought their expertise
and they helped to revive and

00:28:25.722 --> 00:28:30.980
transform the cloth industries
of those areas especially around

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.269
Norwich and Colchester.
 

00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:38.075
But the new draperies were not
the whole story of textile

00:28:38.075 --> 00:28:39.618
diversification.
 

00:28:39.618 --> 00:28:42.368
Up in Lancashire around the
town of Manchester,

00:28:42.368 --> 00:28:45.535
which at this time was not a
great city but a small market

00:28:45.535 --> 00:28:47.344
town,
there was the growth in the

00:28:47.344 --> 00:28:49.972
late sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries of the

00:28:49.972 --> 00:28:52.450
manufacture of so-called
"fustians."

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:56.242
Fustians involved a mixture of
cotton and linen and the

00:28:56.242 --> 00:28:58.938
production of this cloth--
it was cheap,

00:28:58.938 --> 00:29:00.900
coarse cloth for the home
market,

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:03.450
cloth for the poor--was
centered around Manchester.

00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:07.015
It's the distant ancestor of
what was later to be the great

00:29:07.015 --> 00:29:09.720
cotton industry of the city of
Manchester.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.336
Another thing that was
spreading in many rural areas

00:29:12.336 --> 00:29:13.568
was stocking knitting.
 

00:29:13.568 --> 00:29:17.451
The wives of farmers and
agricultural laborers were often

00:29:17.451 --> 00:29:20.640
involved in knitting
high-quality stockings.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.953
Many people knitted stockings
for themselves,

00:29:22.953 --> 00:29:25.951
but there was a market for
high-quality stockings supplied

00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:27.740
by people working in that way.
 

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.368
The stocking industry spread
all over Norfolk,

00:29:30.368 --> 00:29:33.828
spread across the Midlands into
the Nottinghamshire area,

00:29:33.828 --> 00:29:37.596
which is actually still to this
day a center for the manufacture

00:29:37.596 --> 00:29:39.328
of stockings and underwear.
 

00:29:39.328 --> 00:29:44.332
Marks and Spencer's gets a lot
of stuff from Nottinghamshire

00:29:44.332 --> 00:29:45.348
and so on.
 

00:29:45.348 --> 00:29:48.460
One could talk about silks,
luxury textiles.

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:51.973
Silks were introduced by French
Protestant refugees from

00:29:51.973 --> 00:29:55.359
southern France and silk
production became established

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:58.682
principally in eastern London
and also in the town of

00:29:58.682 --> 00:30:00.278
Canterbury in Kent.
 

00:30:00.278 --> 00:30:05.388
So, a lot of diversification,
not only in woolen textiles but

00:30:05.388 --> 00:30:08.538
in some new developments like
silk.

00:30:08.538 --> 00:30:14.257
And this was part of a larger
diversification of manufacturing

00:30:14.257 --> 00:30:16.318
in town and country.
 

00:30:16.318 --> 00:30:20.048
A lot of the new--the
altogether new manufacturers

00:30:20.048 --> 00:30:23.702
which were introduced were
really forms of import

00:30:23.702 --> 00:30:28.345
substitution encouraged by the
royal government so that things

00:30:28.345 --> 00:30:32.380
could be produced at home rather
than imported.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.576
Traditionally,
a great deal of miscellaneous

00:30:35.576 --> 00:30:40.185
manufactured goods actually were
imported, principally from the

00:30:40.185 --> 00:30:42.640
Netherlands or north Germany.
 

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:46.549
Under Elizabeth the privy
council was very responsive

00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:51.060
indeed to anyone with good ideas
for introducing these things

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:52.338
into England.
 

00:30:52.338 --> 00:30:55.883
They would often encourage them
by granting them a patent which

00:30:55.883 --> 00:30:59.368
would give them the monopoly of
producing a certain item for a

00:30:59.368 --> 00:31:02.442
stated period of years,
after which it would be open to

00:31:02.442 --> 00:31:05.247
anyone who wished to participate
in the industry once it was

00:31:05.247 --> 00:31:05.960
established.
 

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.750
It's the origins of the patent
system, of course.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.670
Well, numerous patents were
granted.

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:16.471
To take some examples,
which may seem almost silly but

00:31:16.471 --> 00:31:17.619
they mattered.
 

00:31:17.619 --> 00:31:19.930
Pins.
 

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:23.038
One doesn't usually think of
pins when one thinks of major

00:31:23.038 --> 00:31:27.833
economic expansion,
but in 1597 England imported

00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:34.380
40,000 pounds' worth of pins
from the Netherlands.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:39.279
That's a lot of pins,
and a lot of money.

00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:41.553
In the first decade of the
seventeenth century,

00:31:41.553 --> 00:31:44.122
pin manufacturing was
established under patent in the

00:31:44.122 --> 00:31:45.210
suburbs of London.
 

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.088
They mostly employed children
making the pins.

00:31:48.088 --> 00:31:51.189
By the 1630s,
the patent had expired and it

00:31:51.189 --> 00:31:54.660
spread beyond London,
became particularly established

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.730
in villages in the west of
England in the Gloucestershire

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:58.170
area.
 

00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:02.349
From about this time onward,
most English pins were produced

00:32:02.349 --> 00:32:04.759
at home, and so one could go on.
 

00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:09.578
Glass was nearly always
imported before the 1580s.

00:32:09.578 --> 00:32:13.340
Patents were then granted for
introducing glass manufacture

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.750
particular--
particularly to the counties of

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:18.509
Kent and Sussex and then it
spread to some other places.

00:32:18.509 --> 00:32:21.750
There were glassworks around
Newcastle very soon.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:25.382
By the 1620s,
nearly all glass bottles used

00:32:25.382 --> 00:32:30.398
in England were being produced
at home instead of imported,

00:32:30.398 --> 00:32:31.608
and so on.
 

00:32:31.608 --> 00:32:34.838
Well, industries of this kind
were generally somewhat

00:32:34.838 --> 00:32:37.200
decentralized in their
organization.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:40.279
They were organized on the
putting out system.

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:44.598
They didn't involve a great
deal in the way of investment in

00:32:44.598 --> 00:32:47.893
fixed capital in the form of
industrial plant,

00:32:47.893 --> 00:32:49.868
machinery and so forth.
 

00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:52.410
Principally,
they needed the capital to buy

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:55.131
raw materials,
to pay workers who were working

00:32:55.131 --> 00:32:57.490
in their own cottages or
workshops;

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:02.200
to market the finished goods.
 

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.740
It was all done on the putting
out system,

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:08.873
but there were a number of
other industries which were also

00:33:08.873 --> 00:33:12.792
beginning to bring a rather
different face to industrial

00:33:12.792 --> 00:33:13.720
activity.
 

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:17.288
Iron for example.
 

00:33:17.288 --> 00:33:21.703
Iron manufacturing really got
going in the mid-sixteenth

00:33:21.703 --> 00:33:25.958
century when the technique of
using blast furnaces was

00:33:25.958 --> 00:33:29.250
introduced into England from
Germany.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:33.334
It was greatly encouraged by
Elizabeth's privy council

00:33:33.334 --> 00:33:37.571
because they wanted iron
production domestically for the

00:33:37.571 --> 00:33:39.730
production of munitions.
 

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:42.099
By the 1570s,
there were over fifty blast

00:33:42.099 --> 00:33:45.478
furnaces operating in the
forests of the area known as the

00:33:45.478 --> 00:33:48.092
Weald,
down here towards the south

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:52.452
coast, the forested area with
fast-running streams which were

00:33:52.452 --> 00:33:56.450
suitable for driving some of the
machinery involved.

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:59.288
In the early seventeenth
century, the industry in the

00:33:59.288 --> 00:34:02.076
Weald had stabilized,
even declined a little,

00:34:02.076 --> 00:34:05.798
but there was a great deal of
relocation to south Wales,

00:34:05.798 --> 00:34:09.447
largely because that area
offered a combination of iron

00:34:09.447 --> 00:34:11.682
ore,
forests to provide the timber

00:34:11.682 --> 00:34:14.420
to produce charcoal for the
blast furnaces,

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:19.028
and also fast-running streams
to drive the machinery which was

00:34:19.028 --> 00:34:22.429
used in slitting mills in iron
production,

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:26.159
machinery driven by water
wheels.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.481
All of this is very interesting
to go into in detail to see the

00:34:28.481 --> 00:34:31.681
technology they used,
but I'll spare you that,

00:34:31.681 --> 00:34:37.050
but it can be followed up if
these things interest you.

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:42.585
By...by the 1580s,
the levels of iron production

00:34:42.585 --> 00:34:47.179
of the 1550s had increased
threefold.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:51.579
By the 1640s,
England was producing 23-24,000

00:34:51.579 --> 00:34:54.179
tons of pig iron a year.
 

00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:57.079
Those were the signs of things
to come in the iron industry

00:34:57.079 --> 00:34:59.990
which continued to grow,
but a lot of iron was still

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:02.420
imported from Scandinavia in
particular,

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:06.420
from Sweden especially,
to serve a growing industry

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:10.739
producing metal wares and that
was centered in the West

00:35:10.739 --> 00:35:14.179
Midlands around the town of
Birmingham.

00:35:14.179 --> 00:35:18.673
Metalware production had taken
place there for many years,

00:35:18.673 --> 00:35:22.380
indeed centuries,
but was greatly increasing.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:26.110
They produced there many metal
products used in agriculture and

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:28.820
in the building industries and
in shipping;

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:34.152
nails and locks and scythes and
buckles, latches for doors,

00:35:34.152 --> 00:35:38.289
bits and stirrups for horses,
and so forth.

00:35:38.289 --> 00:35:41.731
All of this was organized by
iron masters who lived in

00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:45.639
emerging towns like Birmingham,
Walsall, and Stourbridge,

00:35:45.639 --> 00:35:49.242
and they did it partly by
employing independent master

00:35:49.242 --> 00:35:53.186
craftsmen to produce specialized
goods for them and also by

00:35:53.186 --> 00:35:56.454
putting out work--
putting out raw materials for

00:35:56.454 --> 00:35:58.630
the simpler items like nail
making,

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:02.610
to cottagers who worked part
time.

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.239
And so one can go on.
 

00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:07.599
Lead production was also
expanding.

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:12.306
Some of the figures are there
in table four,

00:36:12.306 --> 00:36:17.998
1560s only about 600 tons of
lead produced per annum,

00:36:17.998 --> 00:36:21.719
by the 1630s well over 12,000.
 

00:36:21.719 --> 00:36:25.989
Lead production was centered in
the hills of Derbyshire and in

00:36:25.989 --> 00:36:29.980
parts of Somerset where lead
deposits were to be found.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.976
And finally,
perhaps most spectacular of all

00:36:32.976 --> 00:36:36.530
in the introduction of these new
heavier industries,

00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:39.320
was the growth of the coal
industry.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.418
The coal industry,
centered around Newcastle on

00:36:41.418 --> 00:36:44.481
the River Tyne,
grew spectacularly under

00:36:44.481 --> 00:36:49.994
Elizabeth and the early Stuarts
in response above all to the

00:36:49.994 --> 00:36:55.880
demands for fuel exerted by
London and other growing cities.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.356
In the 1580s,
Newcastle exported to London

00:36:59.356 --> 00:37:04.018
through the coastal trade 50,000
tons of coal a year.

00:37:04.018 --> 00:37:08.076
By the 1640s,
it was exporting 300,000 tons

00:37:08.076 --> 00:37:13.871
of coal per year in addition to
which by 1640 another 200,000

00:37:13.871 --> 00:37:18.989
tons were being exported to
other English cities.

00:37:18.989 --> 00:37:21.846
The coal industry could not
have grown as it did without the

00:37:21.846 --> 00:37:24.460
demand being exerted by these
growing urban centers.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.188
Those urban centers could not
have grown as they did without

00:37:28.188 --> 00:37:32.106
the fuel, the cheap fuel which
was coming from the mines of the

00:37:32.106 --> 00:37:32.739
North.
 

00:37:32.739 --> 00:37:35.753
By 1650, the Northeast
alone--and there were coal

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:39.864
fields in some other areas too--
but the Northeast alone was

00:37:39.864 --> 00:37:43.519
producing half a million tons of
coal per annum,

00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:46.010
quite extraordinary output.
 

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:48.340
Just to give you a sense of
what that might mean,

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:53.454
a recent historian of these
developments has calculated that

00:37:53.454 --> 00:37:59.003
a ton of coal yields roughly the
same heat energy as the charcoal

00:37:59.003 --> 00:38:03.945
which could be produced by
harvesting timber on an acre of

00:38:03.945 --> 00:38:04.900
land.
 

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:05.780
Okay?
 

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:09.929
So same heat energy as the
timber from an acre of land.

00:38:09.929 --> 00:38:15.420
So, if you're producing half a
million tons of coal per annum

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:20.820
you have in effect created half
a million acres of land,

00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.215
as it were, in terms of
your--the capacity you would

00:38:24.215 --> 00:38:27.880
need in order to produce that
amount of heat energy,

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:31.056
and that heat energy was used
not only for domestic heating

00:38:31.056 --> 00:38:33.960
but for any industrial process
which required heat.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.483
They couldn't use it for
smelting iron yet but they could

00:38:38.483 --> 00:38:42.119
use it for many,
many industrial processes.

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:42.960
Is that all clear?
 

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.449
Good. You get the point.
 

00:38:46.449 --> 00:38:50.737
It's an interesting way of
representing the difference that

00:38:50.737 --> 00:38:54.360
that kind of industrial
development could make.

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:54.668
Okay.
 

00:38:54.668 --> 00:38:57.829
Well, much of this built on
existing foundations,

00:38:57.829 --> 00:39:00.760
but the sheer scale of
expansion began to give a very

00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:03.750
distinct regional geography to
the English economy.

00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:06.715
There were distinctive areas of
agricultural specialization

00:39:06.715 --> 00:39:09.731
emerging and there were also
those areas which were rendered

00:39:09.731 --> 00:39:12.800
distinctive by their involvement
in industrial activity.

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:16.157
One traveler traveling through
the West Midlands near

00:39:16.157 --> 00:39:19.320
Birmingham in the 1640s
described it as being like

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.452
"one continued
village,"

00:39:21.452 --> 00:39:25.132
large village after large
village heavily involved in iron

00:39:25.132 --> 00:39:26.360
production.
 

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.751
The Stour Valley area
stretching up from Colchester

00:39:30.751 --> 00:39:35.847
where the new draperies were
well established was described

00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:39.041
as with--
continuing--consisting of a

00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:42.920
constellation of villages in
which a small number of

00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:46.721
clothiers set on work "a
great company of poor

00:39:46.721 --> 00:39:48.090
people."
 

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:51.425
There again there's the
extraordinary moonscape which

00:39:51.425 --> 00:39:54.697
was emerging around the
Newcastle coal field area in

00:39:54.697 --> 00:39:58.833
which there were many,
many individual pits working

00:39:58.833 --> 00:40:02.699
down to depths of two or three
hundred feet.

00:40:02.699 --> 00:40:05.003
And then they couldn't really
go any deeper because of

00:40:05.003 --> 00:40:07.480
drainage problems so they would
simply open a new pit,

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:13.449
creating a kind of moonscape
across that whole area.

00:40:13.449 --> 00:40:16.947
This kind of regional
differentiation enhanced the

00:40:16.947 --> 00:40:21.447
redistribution of the population
as people seeking work moved to

00:40:21.447 --> 00:40:25.873
places which had the capacity to
provide them with some kind of

00:40:25.873 --> 00:40:29.000
employment,
be it in agriculture of

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.639
particular kinds or in industry.
 

00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:34.130
I've already touched on the
migration to the towns.

00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:38.442
There was also migration to
certain rural areas which were

00:40:38.442 --> 00:40:43.070
becoming very densely populated,
especially the manufacturing

00:40:43.070 --> 00:40:45.990
districts,
and those densely populated

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.902
areas of course exerted demand
in their turn for the

00:40:49.902 --> 00:40:54.429
agricultural products of a more
specialized agriculture.

00:40:54.429 --> 00:40:59.934
Something of the redistribution
of population which was going on

00:40:59.934 --> 00:41:04.130
is summarized in section five of
your handout.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:08.121
There are some figures
calculated by the demographer

00:41:08.121 --> 00:41:12.503
E.A. Wrigley showing that
between 1520 and 1670 the rural

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:16.190
agricultural population,
those directly employed in

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:19.239
agriculture,
was significantly reduced,

00:41:19.239 --> 00:41:24.617
the urban population living in
towns of over 5,000 rose from

00:41:24.617 --> 00:41:29.836
about 5.5% to over 13%,
and the rural non-agricultural

00:41:29.836 --> 00:41:34.800
population rose from about 18%
to something like 26%.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:41.963
That's the people living in
small towns all working in rural

00:41:41.963 --> 00:41:43.300
industry.
 

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:46.940
All of this was of course
linked together by internal

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:47.500
trade.
 

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:50.666
The established arteries of
internal trade grew in their

00:41:50.666 --> 00:41:51.530
significance.
 

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:53.070
Road traffic increased.
 

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:57.121
Traffic around the coast and on
the rivers, a very good way of

00:41:57.121 --> 00:41:59.780
moving bulky goods,
greatly increased.

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:03.969
Networks of internal trade were
elaborated and tightened.

00:42:03.969 --> 00:42:07.181
If that had not happened,
then none of these developments

00:42:07.181 --> 00:42:08.730
would have been possible.
 

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:12.494
The emerging picture is one of
an elaborating web of commercial

00:42:12.494 --> 00:42:15.713
interconnection pulling the
various regional economies

00:42:15.713 --> 00:42:19.659
together even more tightly than
had previously been the case.

00:42:19.659 --> 00:42:24.961
And this intensification of
commercial activity involved new

00:42:24.961 --> 00:42:29.516
commercial practices,
and one of the best indicators

00:42:29.516 --> 00:42:34.552
of the sheer extent of what was
going on is actually provided by

00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:37.268
the evidence of the law courts.
 

00:42:37.268 --> 00:42:41.606
A great deal of the litigation
which took place in England's

00:42:41.606 --> 00:42:44.619
law courts concerned broken
contracts,

00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:49.469
disagreements over debts or the
meeting of contractual

00:42:49.469 --> 00:42:50.750
obligations.
 

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:53.699
There was an absolutely massive
rise in the amount of such

00:42:53.699 --> 00:42:55.199
business within the courts.
 

00:42:55.199 --> 00:42:58.291
If you look at section six of
your handout,

00:42:58.291 --> 00:43:02.489
you'll see that in 1560 just
over 5,000 cases of this kind

00:43:02.489 --> 00:43:05.949
were heard by the central courts
in London.

00:43:05.949 --> 00:43:11.570
By 1640, it was almost 29,000
cases being heard a year.

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:14.489
And this is just the tip of the
iceberg.

00:43:14.489 --> 00:43:19.106
These are the deals that went
wrong and resulted in someone

00:43:19.106 --> 00:43:20.780
suing someone else.
 

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:25.668
One can only imagine the
massive amount of commercial

00:43:25.668 --> 00:43:28.489
activity which was going on.
 

00:43:28.489 --> 00:43:31.233
Whereas in 1500,
then, a great deal of the

00:43:31.233 --> 00:43:35.719
marketing which had taken place
in England was rather localized,

00:43:35.719 --> 00:43:39.483
with some longer distance flows
going across the kingdom in

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:43.257
particular commodities--
cattle, cloth and so forth--by

00:43:43.257 --> 00:43:47.432
the early seventeenth century
one gets a picture of a society

00:43:47.432 --> 00:43:51.539
which was ever more closely
interconnected and integrated by

00:43:51.539 --> 00:43:54.949
market dealings and commercial
transactions.

00:43:54.949 --> 00:43:57.949
This was in short a
commercializing society,

00:43:57.949 --> 00:44:03.842
an emerging market economy in
which the living and the daily

00:44:03.842 --> 00:44:08.835
economic dealings of a far
larger proportion of the

00:44:08.835 --> 00:44:12.929
population were shaped by the
market.

00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:17.596
And finally it wasn't just
becoming a more internally

00:44:17.596 --> 00:44:22.530
integrated commercial society,
it was one which was also

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:26.300
linked increasingly to a larger
world.

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.867
Because the same decades in the
late sixteenth and early

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:33.306
seventeenth centuries saw a
transformation of overseas

00:44:33.306 --> 00:44:35.960
trade,
from a pattern which had been

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.103
very much based on
short-distance traffic across

00:44:39.103 --> 00:44:42.298
the English Channel,
a few voyages down to other

00:44:42.298 --> 00:44:44.360
French and perhaps Spanish
ports,

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.920
but predominantly concentrated
on the narrow seas,

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:52.284
to one in which English
merchants were trading directly

00:44:52.284 --> 00:44:55.760
with far more diverse areas of
the world.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.724
They began doing so partly to
look for new markets for English

00:44:59.724 --> 00:45:02.101
cloth,
partly also to get direct

00:45:02.101 --> 00:45:05.898
access to the source of much
desired imports which had

00:45:05.898 --> 00:45:09.409
previously been obtained from
the Netherlands.

00:45:09.409 --> 00:45:12.489
They stopped trying to go
direct to source;

00:45:12.489 --> 00:45:16.126
looking for grain,
for wine, for spices,

00:45:16.126 --> 00:45:19.670
for luxury textiles from far
afield.

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:21.119
The late sixteenth century,
of course,

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:24.791
was the beginning of the great
age of exploratory voyages by

00:45:24.791 --> 00:45:28.411
English navigators,
the voyages of Francis Drake,

00:45:28.411 --> 00:45:30.820
Martin Frobisher and so forth.
 

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.297
But the really significant
thing from the point of view of

00:45:33.297 --> 00:45:35.556
the economic development of the
period were those who

00:45:35.556 --> 00:45:38.114
undertake--
undertook trading voyages to

00:45:38.114 --> 00:45:41.275
establish new trades,
often with royal backing,

00:45:41.275 --> 00:45:45.235
often through forming companies
which would get a royal charter

00:45:45.235 --> 00:45:48.873
to conduct trade with somewhere
with which England had not

00:45:48.873 --> 00:45:50.789
previously traded direct.
 

00:45:50.789 --> 00:45:55.699
So companies were founded with
royal charters to trade to the

00:45:55.699 --> 00:45:59.708
Baltic in search of the furs,
the grain of Poland,

00:45:59.708 --> 00:46:02.280
the timber products of
Scandinavia,

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.190
all of which had a place in
England's growing economy.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:09.637
Companies were founded to trade
with Russia, sailing north

00:46:09.637 --> 00:46:12.420
around Scandinavia to the port
of Archangel.

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:16.923
They intended to proceed from
there to get access to central

00:46:16.923 --> 00:46:19.998
Asian goods,
though that was an enterprise

00:46:19.998 --> 00:46:23.815
which didn't succeed,
but they established trade with

00:46:23.815 --> 00:46:24.480
Muscovy.
 

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.217
There was increasing trade
direct with Spain principally

00:46:28.217 --> 00:46:31.889
for wine and currants,
which were extremely popular.

00:46:31.889 --> 00:46:37.505
There was direct trade with
Italy first of all and then with

00:46:37.505 --> 00:46:41.980
the Levant, bringing in spices,
luxury textiles,

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.360
wine and other goods.
 

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.255
And finally,
once the Muscovy company had

00:46:47.255 --> 00:46:51.311
learned that it could not
successfully reach the East via

00:46:51.311 --> 00:46:53.574
Russia,
they imitated the Portuguese

00:46:53.574 --> 00:46:57.404
and went the other way,
around Africa to establish the

00:46:57.404 --> 00:47:02.574
trade with the East Indies with
the voyages of the East India

00:47:02.574 --> 00:47:07.657
Company chartered in 1599 and
voyaging for the first time in

00:47:07.657 --> 00:47:08.518
1601.
 

00:47:08.518 --> 00:47:11.900
All of these trades once they
had become established were

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:15.039
consolidated and expanding in
the course of the early

00:47:15.039 --> 00:47:18.661
seventeenth century when they
were joined by yet another area

00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:21.768
of activity,
the Atlantic trades.

00:47:21.768 --> 00:47:24.777
By the 1630s,
there were already 300 English

00:47:24.777 --> 00:47:28.554
ships a year fishing off
Newfoundland and bringing back

00:47:28.554 --> 00:47:32.820
the fish to Europe where dried
cod was particularly popular in

00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.989
parts of southern Europe.
 

00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:38.706
And increasingly trade had been
established with the colonies

00:47:38.706 --> 00:47:41.309
established upon the American
mainland,

00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:45.760
after 1607, in Virginia and
then Maryland of course,

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.119
from the 1620s onwards in the
Northeast,

00:47:49.119 --> 00:47:52.239
and Caribbean colonies,
notably Barbados,

00:47:52.239 --> 00:47:54.820
being established in the same
period.

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:59.449
Jamaica wasn't conquered until
the 1650s.

00:47:59.449 --> 00:48:03.177
Most of these colonies managed
to get on their feet through

00:48:03.177 --> 00:48:06.199
establishing plantation
economies of course,

00:48:06.199 --> 00:48:09.894
and they produced the goods
which were increasingly imported

00:48:09.894 --> 00:48:13.090
into England and then sold on to
other customers.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.938
Tobacco for example,
tobacco first being produced in

00:48:16.938 --> 00:48:21.389
large quantities from 1617 in
Virginia, the salvation of the

00:48:21.389 --> 00:48:22.219
colony.
 

00:48:22.219 --> 00:48:26.043
60,000 thousand pounds of
tobacco were being imported into

00:48:26.043 --> 00:48:27.719
London already by 1622.
 

00:48:27.719 --> 00:48:31.954
By 1638, they were bringing in
two million pounds of tobacco

00:48:31.954 --> 00:48:35.543
per annum, and from-- yes,
we're very ungrateful to

00:48:35.543 --> 00:48:38.199
tobacco,
&gt;

00:48:38.199 --> 00:48:39.719
it had a major role.
 

00:48:39.719 --> 00:48:43.577
And that was followed from the
1640s by another product about

00:48:43.577 --> 00:48:48.751
which we're very ungrateful,
sugar, being produced in the

00:48:48.751 --> 00:48:54.320
West Indies and exported for
refining in London.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:58.460
So then we have a panorama of
economic expansion.

00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:04.518
Attempts to establish overall
national income in this period

00:49:04.518 --> 00:49:09.164
are extremely dodgy,
but a number of heroic economic

00:49:09.164 --> 00:49:13.809
historians have attempted to do
it and you'll find the estimates

00:49:13.809 --> 00:49:16.760
there in section eight of your
table.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:22.119
It seems likely that between
the 1560s and the 1590s national

00:49:22.119 --> 00:49:27.210
income had risen by about 48%
and it rose by a further 51%

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:32.338
between the 1590s and 1640,
over the 80 years as a whole

00:49:32.338 --> 00:49:37.280
something like 120% growth in
national income in real terms.

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:41.934
If they're right about that,
and even if they're wrong by

00:49:41.934 --> 00:49:43.929
20%, it's still a lot.
 

00:49:43.929 --> 00:49:47.460
If they're right about that,
it helps to account for the

00:49:47.460 --> 00:49:51.438
fact that population growth was
sustained as long as it was and

00:49:51.438 --> 00:49:54.648
for the growing signs of
prosperity which one finds

00:49:54.648 --> 00:49:56.510
throughout this period.
 

00:49:56.510 --> 00:50:00.518
And yet despite those positive
and optimistic signs,

00:50:00.518 --> 00:50:03.860
as you'll see in the final
table, table nine,

00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:08.250
the prices of basic foodstuffs
were still rising,

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:11.985
suggesting that despite
increased output there was a

00:50:11.985 --> 00:50:16.380
continued imbalance between
population and food resources.

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:20.532
The period also saw complaints
of poverty and a continuing

00:50:20.532 --> 00:50:23.739
decline in the purchasing power
of wages,

00:50:23.739 --> 00:50:29.445
the declining real wages which
you'll find in the final column

00:50:29.445 --> 00:50:32.159
of that table on the right.
 

00:50:32.159 --> 00:50:37.219
So having looked at the
panorama of economic expansion,

00:50:37.219 --> 00:50:42.148
what we have to do next time is
to look at how this growing

00:50:42.148 --> 00:50:47.246
national wealth was actually
distributed socially and how the

00:50:47.246 --> 00:50:52.260
trends of this period worked out
in terms of the actual life

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:55.829
chances of particular social
groups.

00:50:55.829 --> 00:50:57.500
And I'll do that on Thursday.
 

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:03.000

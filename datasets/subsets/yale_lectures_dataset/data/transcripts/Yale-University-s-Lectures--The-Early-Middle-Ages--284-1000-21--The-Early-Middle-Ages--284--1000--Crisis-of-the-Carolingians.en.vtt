00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.300
PAUL FREEDMAN: We're
going to talk today, now,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.600
about Carolingian decline.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.333
It's not just that
we're compressing

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:09.767
lectures or in a hurry.

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:12.233
The empire of Charlemagne
is an empire that does

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.867
not last that long.

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:17.367
So when we say that it has
certain flaws, like size,

00:00:17.367 --> 00:00:20.867
well, we already said that the
Roman Empire had this flaw.

00:00:20.867 --> 00:00:22.000
We've already said
that the Abbasid

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.467
Caliphate has this flaw.

00:00:24.467 --> 00:00:29.067
But those empires are able to
manage with this weakness for

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:32.667
quite some time.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.300
Part of the problem with
the Carolingian

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.133
Empire is its size.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:41.433
Part of it, however, as you
will have read in the

00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:47.933
Fichtenau reading is its lack of
infrastructure and economic

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:48.633
development.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:53.433
Infrastructure in a sense of
not just towns, roads,

00:00:53.433 --> 00:00:58.133
communications, but social
infrastructure, the lack of an

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:03.267
idea of obeying the state or
obeying the ruler, and a

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:09.100
tendency, therefore, to mix
private and public interest,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.900
and to the benefit
of the powerful.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.800
We'll talk more about that.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.967
There are also external
problems. The beginnings of

00:01:17.967 --> 00:01:21.767
the Viking invasion, which we
will be talking about after

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:28.067
the break, occur before
Charlemagne's death in 814.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:30.867
Nevertheless, there's
no sense hastening

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:32.633
the signs of decline.

00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:36.600
We always can see signs of
decline coming after.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.800
But Charlemagne's rule had been
so successful, so full of

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.433
accomplishments, he was a ruler
such prestige, that even

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:52.033
the difficult last ten years or
so of his reign can't quite

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:54.033
eclipse that.

00:01:54.033 --> 00:02:01.667
In 801, there arrived an
elephant at the court of

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:06.833
Charlemagne, a gift from the
caliph of Baghdad, Harun

00:02:06.833 --> 00:02:11.067
al-Rashid, the caliph who
figures in the Arabian Nights

00:02:11.067 --> 00:02:13.233
entertainments.

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:18.700
This is a link between two very
powerful and very distant

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.800
empires, the two of the three
that we've described as, in

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.067
some sense, heirs to the Roman
classical empire and

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:30.033
civilization.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:34.667
There was a tentative thought
of, perhaps, an alliance

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:37.600
between Baghdad and Aachen,
the capital of

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.000
Charlemagne's empire.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.467
At various times, there had
been negotiations between

00:02:43.467 --> 00:02:50.000
Constantinople and Aachen
discussing the possibility of

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.633
an imperial marriage.

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:55.633
The Carolingian ruler was
contemptuous of Byzantium

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:58.433
because it was ruled by a woman,
the Empress Irene, a

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:01.833
rather exceptional figure.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:06.200
But neither the alliance with
Byzantium, at least not at

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.767
this point, and certainly not
the more far-fetched alliance

00:03:09.767 --> 00:03:12.333
with Baghdad came to anything.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:16.133
The elephant was certainly the
first one seen in Europe

00:03:16.133 --> 00:03:22.700
probably since Hannibal and
his invasion of Italy.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.200
And how he got there, what the
logistics of his transport

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.033
were, how he got to Baghdad in
the first place-- it's not as

00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:31.933
if they have elephants
in the natural

00:03:31.933 --> 00:03:35.567
habitat of Iraq either.

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.367
Nevertheless, here's this
elephant who lives

00:03:37.367 --> 00:03:38.967
for about ten years.

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:42.667
One of the signs of things
starting to unravel in the

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:46.167
Carolingian Empire, so some
historians say, is the death

00:03:46.167 --> 00:03:48.800
of Charlemagne's elephant, which
Einhard talks about,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.300
actually, in his biography; that
is, it is an event that's

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.500
worth mentioning.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.400
But pets, they don't
last forever.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.467
As someone who lost his cat
within recent memory, you've

00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:04.833
just got to get over it.

00:04:04.833 --> 00:04:07.933
On the other hand, I can
get another cat.

00:04:07.933 --> 00:04:11.000
And Charlemagne, presumably--

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.500
well, not presumably.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.500
We know he didn't get
another elephant.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.733
The high watermark of
his reign seems

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:20.700
to be the year 802.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.000
This is arbitrary, but this is
shown by the energy of his

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.567
quarrel with the Byzantine
empress over his arrogating to

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:33.633
himself the title of emperor.

00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:36.400
This is the first person in
the West claiming to be

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.333
emperor, and the Byzantine
Empire doesn't like it.

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:50.433
By 802, he is done with his two
campaigns; one in Spain,

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:54.033
and the other in Saxony and
the regions of the Danube.

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:56.767
He had pacified the
Saxons after a

00:04:56.767 --> 00:04:59.267
nearly twenty-year effort.

00:04:59.267 --> 00:05:04.800
And while he hadn't achieved his
ambitions in Spain, he had

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.800
seized territory in
the northern part

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.233
of what's now Catalonia.

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:16.000
He attempted to address the
problem that I've just

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.100
identified, namely the tendency
of powerful people to

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:27.633
take over and rule localities
not as government servants,

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:31.400
but as noble rulers.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:38.200
He, in order to combat that,
tried to get every free man in

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.000
his realm to swear an oath to
him personally, that is to

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.800
make sure that they understood
that their prime loyalty had

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.433
to be to the emperor and not
to the count, duke, local

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:54.600
ruler, bishop, whoever he was.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.867
And the instructions that he
gave to the men sent out to

00:05:58.867 --> 00:06:04.067
try and to administer this oath
show you some of his idea

00:06:04.067 --> 00:06:05.433
of rulership.

00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:08.033
We've talked about this already,
but since it's a

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:13.533
fairly complex idea, it's
worth emphasizing.

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:17.333
In the instructions, it says,
"Let each man keep himself in

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:20.533
the sacred service of God,
following the divine

00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:23.067
commandment and observing
whatever promise he may have

00:06:23.067 --> 00:06:27.100
made fully, to the best of his
understanding and powers.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.700
For the lord emperor cannot
exercise his vigilance or

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.900
powers of correction over every
man." So the notion that

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.233
the emperor is supposed to
be responsible for people

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:43.133
behaving themselves, is
responsible for not just what

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:47.433
we would call political order,
or peace, but for the

00:06:47.433 --> 00:06:52.367
salvation of the people, for
the spiritual as well as

00:06:52.367 --> 00:06:58.100
political health of the realm,
is typically Carolingian, and,

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.967
in a way, typically medieval.

00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:05.333
There's a sense of imperial
responsibility before God for

00:07:05.333 --> 00:07:09.067
the behavior of the emperor's
subjects.

00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:13.867
But already, a few years
later in 806, this

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:18.133
idea has been weakened.

00:07:18.133 --> 00:07:19.267
In eighteen 806--

00:07:19.267 --> 00:07:21.867
if you take a look at the first
map that I've given out,

00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:28.467
we have a partition in 806, an
agreement at a place called

00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:29.700
Thionville.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.033
I guess this is going to have
to be spelled out, since we

00:07:36.033 --> 00:07:36.667
don't have chalk.

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:41.333
T-H-I-O-N-V-I-L-L-E. And it's
written on the first-- well,

00:07:41.333 --> 00:07:43.733
no it just says, proposed
partition.

00:07:43.733 --> 00:07:51.733
In 806, he came up with the
idea of dividing his realm

00:07:51.733 --> 00:07:54.567
among his three children.

00:07:54.567 --> 00:07:59.300
His son Charles would get the
north, his son Pepin would get

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.500
Lombardy and Bavaria,
and his son

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.000
Louis would have Aquitaine.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.600
In this document, there's no
mention of the imperial title,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.633
leading one to surmise that
maybe he thought this title

00:08:12.633 --> 00:08:15.900
was just his personal
accomplishment.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.033
Maybe he didn't really envisage
the reestablishment

00:08:19.033 --> 00:08:24.400
of the Roman Empire in any
kind of permanent way.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.033
Here, we just have a kind
of splitting up of land.

00:08:29.867 --> 00:08:34.533
Louis gets the southwest;
Charles gets the lion's share,

00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:40.900
the heartlands of the
Carolingian family, the parts

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:43.233
of Germany that the Carolingians
controlled and

00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:46.500
northern France; and Pepin
gets Italy and the Alps.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.267
So here you have a contrast
between 802, this grandiose

00:08:53.267 --> 00:08:57.800
imperial idea of unity, 806,
just like the Merovingians,

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:04.933
partitioning out the lands for
the successors of Charlemagne.

00:09:07.567 --> 00:09:10.533
Aachen is a long way from
being another Byzantium

00:09:10.533 --> 00:09:12.367
Constantinople or
another Baghdad.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:22.167
And in these capitularies, the
documents that are issued by

00:09:22.167 --> 00:09:26.300
the court of instructions to the
administrators, we do see,

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:33.467
as Fichtenau emphasizes, a
sense of unease and of

00:09:33.467 --> 00:09:37.500
problems. Again and again,
the capitularies lament

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.767
corruption, maladministration.

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:50.167
They start to mention the
Vikings as more than just a

00:09:50.167 --> 00:09:56.167
minor, mosquito-bite-level
distraction.

00:09:56.167 --> 00:09:58.167
But most of all, they emphasize

00:09:58.167 --> 00:10:02.300
usurpation of royal authority.

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:07.367
Usurpation meaning, again, that
the people, such as the

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:13.367
counts or dukes or the nobles
who are supposed to be

00:10:13.367 --> 00:10:17.167
servants of the crown, supposed
to be his chief

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:22.900
servants, are taking over for
themselves things like taxes,

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:26.100
revenues, the right
of judgment, the

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:29.100
right to punish people.

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:35.700
And people are tending to look
at them as their rulers.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.200
The count of Flanders, the count
of Barcelona, the duke

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.700
of Aquitaine, these are people
who are starting to think of

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.633
themselves as potentially, at
least, rulers who might

00:10:48.633 --> 00:10:51.600
transmit their office
to their children.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.367
And it then is not an office,
it's a possession, if you have

00:10:55.367 --> 00:10:57.500
a right of inheritance.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:04.367
In other words, I could transmit
to my children my

00:11:04.367 --> 00:11:12.633
ten-year-old car, my silver
butter dish, all of my

00:11:12.633 --> 00:11:17.633
treasured possessions, but I
cannot transmit to them the

00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:21.733
professorship that I have. I
can't just say, well, my

00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:24.700
eldest son is going to be a
professor of medieval history

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.500
at Yale, whether or not he has
any interest in doing that,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.800
because I don't own
the position.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.500
It's not my property.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.300
It is my office.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.233
We're so familiar with this that
we don't even think about

00:11:38.233 --> 00:11:39.400
what it would be like.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.700
Well, we actually do, because
there are some things that

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:45.800
people do tend to start to own
that, originally, were not

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.967
supposed to be that way.

00:11:46.967 --> 00:11:51.100
But in the medieval world, it
is a problem to dislodge

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:55.433
people from property, because
most property is in land.

00:11:55.433 --> 00:11:58.767
All Yale has to do is stop
paying me, and I'm no longer

00:11:58.767 --> 00:12:00.500
benefiting from this office.

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:05.467
On the other hand, if I had
a castle across campus and

00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:09.833
stored some boiling pitch and
some followers, naturally,

00:12:09.833 --> 00:12:16.867
some trusty drinking mates, and
had this a little moat and

00:12:16.867 --> 00:12:20.667
bailey establishment right
outside of Harkness, I could

00:12:20.667 --> 00:12:24.033
terrorize Yale and
extort from it.

00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:26.333
That picture is not
so far-fetched.

00:12:26.333 --> 00:12:30.800
Where the picture is really
not far-fetched is if you

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.333
imagine Yale in ruins.

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:38.967
People pasturing sheep on Cross
Campus and wondering

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:40.900
"God, what were those
buildings, anyway?

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.367
They're really huge.

00:12:42.367 --> 00:12:45.267
And all those funny little
blackboards, whatever they

00:12:45.267 --> 00:12:52.067
were for." And then using WLH
to build fortifications.

00:12:52.067 --> 00:12:58.033
Why build a new castle on the
lawn when you've got building

00:12:58.033 --> 00:13:00.367
materials that somebody
else left for you?

00:13:00.367 --> 00:13:06.433
So WLH 117, 116, 115 are
one person's fortress.

00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:10.867
And that auditorium at the other
end is somebody else's.

00:13:10.867 --> 00:13:15.567
And here I'm getting a little
bit ahead of myself, but this

00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:17.867
is what's going to happen once
the Carolingian Empire

00:13:17.867 --> 00:13:20.100
dissolves, essentially.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.867
When I say to people usurp or
arrogate or make hereditary

00:13:24.867 --> 00:13:27.133
their possessions,
I'm talking about

00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:29.733
something that sounds abstract.

00:13:29.733 --> 00:13:33.233
But if you think of it in terms
of what it means to defy

00:13:33.233 --> 00:13:37.267
people, basically,
you're talking

00:13:37.267 --> 00:13:38.300
about building castles.

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.500
And this has to do with
the nature of warfare.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.400
This is all a subject for the
course that succeeds this one,

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.633
but it has to do with the nature
of warfare, in the

00:13:46.633 --> 00:13:49.600
sense that, once you have that
castle, it's very hard to be

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.867
dislodged from it.

00:13:50.867 --> 00:13:52.133
The advantage is with
the defense.

00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:58.567
Catapults, trebuchets, all these
interesting weapons,

00:13:58.567 --> 00:14:01.467
actually, both require an insane
amount of mobilization

00:14:01.467 --> 00:14:07.600
and organization and are not as
effective as artillery some

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.367
centuries later is
going to be.

00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:13.700
So the problems of Charlemagne's
empire--

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:19.167
despite the invasions that will
be our subject for Monday

00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:20.300
after Thanksgiving--

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.100
the problems of Charlemagne's
empire are essentially

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.600
internal, as was the case of the
Roman Empire, only moreso.

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.933
These internal problems, what
I've called the lack of

00:14:31.933 --> 00:14:36.300
infrastructure, which means
political and economic

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.933
infrastructure, make it very
difficult, effectively, to

00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:41.467
resist the Vikings.

00:14:41.467 --> 00:14:44.033
And there are other invaders
whom we'll have to mention as

00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:51.500
well, later on, the Hungarians
and invaders and raiders from

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.767
North Africa.

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:57.000
The empire was too large,
given the nature of

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.333
communications and
the mechanisms

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:05.200
available to impose order.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.300
The same thing that made it an
empire made it have some

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:14.900
disadvantages: diversity of
population, ethnic loyalties.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.967
So you have revolts of
Aquitainians who are not

00:15:21.967 --> 00:15:27.300
Franks; of Bretons, people of
Britanny, who are not Franks;

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.667
Bavarians; Visigoths.

00:15:29.667 --> 00:15:33.467
All of these people are not
necessarily overjoyed with

00:15:33.467 --> 00:15:38.100
Frankish rule, not necessarily
immune from the possibility of

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.167
seizing on the weakness of
the Franks to rebel.

00:15:46.067 --> 00:15:49.033
These problems become more
manifest in the reign of

00:15:49.033 --> 00:15:52.333
Charlemagne's son, Louis
the Pious, who

00:15:52.333 --> 00:15:56.900
rules from 814 to 840.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:00.267
My hesitation in using the
word rules is that he is

00:16:00.267 --> 00:16:05.333
deposed once and forced to
undergo public penance twice.

00:16:09.367 --> 00:16:13.400
One of the problems of the
empire was obviated, however.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:19.833
When Charlemagne died in 814,
the succession was just to

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:21.633
Louis because his brothers
had died.

00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:25.733
So the 806 deal, or
806 plan, was not

00:16:25.733 --> 00:16:28.167
implemented and became moot.

00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:32.533
Charlemagne was succeeded by one
sole ruler over the entire

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:34.933
empire, Louis the Pious,
because Pepin

00:16:34.933 --> 00:16:36.200
and Charles had died.

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.900
Louis is often seen as inept
but well-meaning.

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:43.167
His sobriquet--

00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:47.267
and a lot of the Carolingian
rulers now have

00:16:47.267 --> 00:16:51.167
less-flattering than Pious
Charles the Bald, well, that

00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:54.000
seems a little unfair.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.133
Charles the Simple, Charles the
Fat, Louis the Stammerer,

00:16:58.133 --> 00:16:59.367
Louis the Child.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.200
You get the idea.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:05.633
Not an imposing group
of rulers.

00:17:05.633 --> 00:17:09.833
But pious, shouldn't pious
be a complement?

00:17:09.833 --> 00:17:13.700
And indeed, it could be.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.067
And, as it happens, he's not
known as Louis the Pious in

00:17:17.067 --> 00:17:18.967
every language.

00:17:18.967 --> 00:17:21.933
So in German, he's referred to
as Louis the Pious, but in

00:17:21.933 --> 00:17:28.033
French, he's Louis the Debonair,
the Imposing.

00:17:28.033 --> 00:17:29.967
He is an imposing figure,
actually.

00:17:29.967 --> 00:17:33.767
He's not as weak as what I'm
going to say in the rest of

00:17:33.767 --> 00:17:35.633
the discussion about him is
going to make him look.

00:17:35.633 --> 00:17:37.600
He was a very effective
general.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.467
He did a lot of wars
in southern France.

00:17:42.467 --> 00:17:45.133
He was the effective
ruler of Aquitaine.

00:17:45.133 --> 00:17:49.800
He conquered Barcelona
for Charlemagne.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:59.167
He suffered from three
problems, however.

00:17:59.167 --> 00:18:06.267
One not at all of his own
making, the second certainly

00:18:06.267 --> 00:18:09.800
exacerbated by his vacillation,
and the third is

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.867
just who he was.

00:18:10.867 --> 00:18:13.500
The first problem is
the invasions.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:17.567
The Viking invasions, in
particular, begin during his

00:18:17.567 --> 00:18:20.000
reign, first part of
the ninth century.

00:18:22.967 --> 00:18:24.733
So it's an external problem.

00:18:24.733 --> 00:18:29.800
On the other hand, the lack of
an effective response does

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:35.267
have to do with flaws in the
nature of Carolingian rule,

00:18:35.267 --> 00:18:39.800
flaws in the nature of Louis'
rule, in particular.

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.933
The second problem
is his sons.

00:18:43.933 --> 00:18:46.633
His sons fought against
each other and

00:18:46.633 --> 00:18:48.133
against their father.

00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:49.967
This is not something
that's new to us.

00:18:49.967 --> 00:18:54.100
We've seen this with
the Merovingians.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:19:01.900
But in order to maintain control
of sons who expect

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:06.267
some kind of rulership and who
are jockeying for power with

00:19:06.267 --> 00:19:10.833
their siblings, Louis made it
worse, in part, because he had

00:19:10.833 --> 00:19:15.067
sons by two marriages and tried
to carve out another

00:19:15.067 --> 00:19:18.767
realm for his youngest son,
Charles the Bald, Charles the

00:19:18.767 --> 00:19:20.233
future the Bald.

00:19:20.233 --> 00:19:22.333
I don't know that he was called
Charles the Bald when

00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:24.100
he was fourteen.

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:27.567
I actually don't know when
that title starts

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:29.800
to come into effect.

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.067
Not title, nickname.

00:19:36.167 --> 00:19:40.867
As we'll see, these civil wars
have greater significance than

00:19:40.867 --> 00:19:43.700
mere civil wars, because they're
at the origins of the

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:48.133
breaking up of the empire into
entities that we can just

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:51.433
about start to call France
and Germany.

00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:54.100
So we're at the kind of
crucible, or moment of

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.767
creation, of the European order
that will exist for the

00:19:59.767 --> 00:20:04.667
next more than 1,000 years.

00:20:04.667 --> 00:20:09.867
Louis had very sophisticated
ideas about imperial rule.

00:20:09.867 --> 00:20:11.900
Perhaps even more sophisticated
than those of

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:17.233
his father, because Louis was
quite a bit more educated than

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:23.233
Charlemagne, quite literate,
one might almost say an

00:20:23.233 --> 00:20:26.067
intellectual as well as
an effective general.

00:20:26.067 --> 00:20:32.067
But he was less pragmatic, less
realistic, less flexible

00:20:32.067 --> 00:20:34.867
than his father.

00:20:34.867 --> 00:20:37.533
Even more than Charlemagne,
Louis believed that the

00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:41.500
emperor must answer before God
for the conduct of his

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.167
population.

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:50.000
Even more than Charlemagne, he
believed that he ruled over a

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.167
sanctified state.

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:53.767
In other words, he was not just
a political ruler, he

00:20:53.767 --> 00:20:56.800
was, in some sense, a religious
leader that the

00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.400
religious and the political were
not to be distinguished.

00:21:04.867 --> 00:21:10.667
If the state is a religious
entity, does it mean that the

00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:13.767
state rules over the Church?

00:21:13.767 --> 00:21:17.133
Or if it's a religious entity,
perhaps it means that the

00:21:17.133 --> 00:21:20.167
Church rules over the state?

00:21:20.167 --> 00:21:23.400
It can go either way.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.933
When Charlemagne was crowned
by the pope, he certainly

00:21:28.933 --> 00:21:31.233
indicated a conception
of rulership

00:21:31.233 --> 00:21:33.467
sanctified by the Church.

00:21:33.467 --> 00:21:36.267
He was not at all worried
about the pope

00:21:36.267 --> 00:21:37.700
dictating to him.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.500
He had rescued the pope
from the Roman mob.

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.233
The pope was utterly
dependent on him.

00:21:44.233 --> 00:21:47.767
But that is not necessarily
the way things would be.

00:21:47.767 --> 00:21:51.667
And Louis had less to worry
about from the popes than from

00:21:51.667 --> 00:21:54.167
his own bishops.

00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:59.800
Taking his rulership as a sacred
trust seriously meant

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:05.867
that, in 822, he appeared at
a place called Attigny.

00:22:05.867 --> 00:22:09.200
A-T-T-I-G-N-Y, Attigny.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.500
In the Church of Attigny,
covered with ashes and dressed

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.933
in sack cloth, which the Bible
describes, and which, I guess,

00:22:17.933 --> 00:22:24.000
burlap would be the best modern
equivalent, so dressed

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.933
in rags, literally, covered with
ashes to ask forgiveness

00:22:29.933 --> 00:22:34.000
for the way in which the
rebellion of his nephew,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.267
Bernard, had been suppressed.

00:22:36.267 --> 00:22:40.533
Not only were his son's
restless, but his nephew had

00:22:40.533 --> 00:22:48.233
rebelled, been captured,
been blinded, and died.

00:22:48.233 --> 00:22:49.300
The blinding--

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:53.533
maybe they knew how to do
it better in Byzantium--

00:22:53.533 --> 00:22:56.100
was supposed to be a more humane
alternative, rendering

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.333
him unfit to rule but
sparing his life.

00:22:58.333 --> 00:23:00.567
But, in the end, he died.

00:23:00.567 --> 00:23:04.267
Louis was full of remorse
for this and did a

00:23:04.267 --> 00:23:05.933
public act of penance.

00:23:05.933 --> 00:23:09.900
And we know from the experience
of all forms of

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.600
leadership, including modern,
that there are ways of saying

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:19.200
you're sorry and ways of not
saying you're sorry.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.033
The problem with a political
officer or ruler saying they

00:23:24.033 --> 00:23:27.867
are sorry is that it may
make them look weak.

00:23:27.867 --> 00:23:31.667
It may make them lose their
aura of leadership.

00:23:31.667 --> 00:23:35.867
The problem with them not saying
they're sorry, in the

00:23:35.867 --> 00:23:39.467
modern world, of course,
is also very great.

00:23:39.467 --> 00:23:44.600
And it's very tricky to
negotiate a line that

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:47.733
preserves command but also
gives, at least, the

00:23:47.733 --> 00:23:50.667
impression of candor.

00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:53.200
Louis does not have
Charlemagne's instinctive

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.333
charisma of leadership.

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:59.933
The penance at Attigny resulted
in his loss of

00:23:59.933 --> 00:24:06.000
prestige and a great increase
in the power of the Church.

00:24:08.833 --> 00:24:13.067
So there had always been an
implicit danger of this once

00:24:13.067 --> 00:24:19.400
Frankish and Christian ideas
of rulership were merged.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.767
Charlemagne, as I've said,
had no problem with

00:24:21.767 --> 00:24:25.133
this, but Louis did.

00:24:25.133 --> 00:24:31.000
Already in 829, Pope Gregory
IV would claim, "is not the

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.533
authority over souls, which
belongs to the pope, above the

00:24:35.533 --> 00:24:41.733
imperial rule, which is of this
world?" The implication

00:24:41.733 --> 00:24:45.133
here is that because the
spiritual is superior to the

00:24:45.133 --> 00:24:50.933
material, in moral terms. And
why is the spiritual superior

00:24:50.933 --> 00:24:52.733
to the material?

00:24:52.733 --> 00:24:55.267
This is a sort of Plato's
Republic kind of question.

00:24:58.033 --> 00:24:58.867
I'm just saying this--

00:24:58.867 --> 00:24:59.367
Yes?

00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:02.600
STUDENT: It's morality over
the pressures of lust or

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.367
something like that.

00:25:03.367 --> 00:25:05.433
PROFESSOR: And not
merely morality over the

00:25:05.433 --> 00:25:08.033
pleasures of lust. What's the
problem with the pleasures of

00:25:08.033 --> 00:25:11.033
lust, from the killjoy, Plato's

00:25:11.033 --> 00:25:12.933
Republic point of view?

00:25:12.933 --> 00:25:14.200
STUDENT: They end.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.900
PROFESSOR:
They end.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:16.900
Right.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.867
They end.

00:25:17.867 --> 00:25:19.400
They are mortal.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.467
They die.

00:25:20.467 --> 00:25:23.267
And so is all matter,
by definition.

00:25:23.267 --> 00:25:25.000
All matter fades.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.467
So which is superior, the
spiritual or the material?

00:25:30.467 --> 00:25:32.600
The spiritual doesn't die.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.367
The spiritual is immortal.

00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:37.500
That's what makes
it spiritual.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.900
That's what the Forms, or
reality, or the higher, the

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.800
invisible, invisible-but-real.

00:25:47.433 --> 00:25:50.767
To put ourselves in the mindset
of 829, of course we

00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:52.100
have to admit that.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.467
You may not feel that.

00:25:54.467 --> 00:25:56.867
I'm not urging this upon
you as a world view.

00:25:56.867 --> 00:25:59.467
You may think that there is no
such thing as the spiritual.

00:25:59.467 --> 00:26:01.400
Or you may think that
the spiritual is as

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.667
mortal as the material.

00:26:04.667 --> 00:26:07.000
But in 829, people would
agree, "Yeah, OK, the

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.967
spiritual is superior to the
material, because it's

00:26:08.967 --> 00:26:12.133
immortal and the material
withers and dies." But does

00:26:12.133 --> 00:26:17.100
that mean that the spiritual has
got to rule the material?

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:20.100
That's the question for the
ages, at least for the

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:21.333
medieval ages.

00:26:24.967 --> 00:26:27.233
So Louis the Pious
and his sons.

00:26:27.233 --> 00:26:38.933
In 817, Louis issues an order,
map number B, to divvy up the

00:26:38.933 --> 00:26:44.033
realm in the event of his death,
an order called the

00:26:44.033 --> 00:26:46.267
ordinatio imperii, the ordering
of the empire.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.667
This, unlike Charlemagne's
division, really expresses an

00:26:53.667 --> 00:26:55.533
idea of imperial rule.

00:26:55.533 --> 00:27:00.867
Louis associates with himself
his eldest son, Lothar.

00:27:00.867 --> 00:27:04.867
And look at how big their
territory is.

00:27:04.867 --> 00:27:06.633
First of all, it's huge.

00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:10.267
It encompasses the Carolingian
ancestral lands.

00:27:10.267 --> 00:27:15.067
And basically, the other sons,
Louis the German, Bernard, and

00:27:15.067 --> 00:27:25.767
Pepin, are given a bunch
of adjunct lands.

00:27:25.767 --> 00:27:27.300
And in fact--I'm sorry.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:28.100
Bernard is not his son.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.967
It's his nephew.

00:27:29.967 --> 00:27:33.267
And this is what Bernard rebels
against-- the rebellion

00:27:33.267 --> 00:27:35.967
that will cause his blinding
and death--

00:27:35.967 --> 00:27:39.100
is this, what he regarded as a
few crumbs from the table,

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.400
rather than a full share.

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.733
The real problem begins,
however, even after Attigny in

00:27:45.733 --> 00:27:50.667
825 when Louis' second wife
gave birth to a son named

00:27:50.667 --> 00:27:54.133
Charles, thus complicating
the succession.

00:27:54.133 --> 00:27:58.967
His second wife, Judith, urged
him to fit Charles into the

00:27:58.967 --> 00:28:03.133
succession, and this enraged
the older sons

00:28:03.133 --> 00:28:04.367
from his first marriage.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.567
In a 829, a council
met at Paris.

00:28:12.567 --> 00:28:15.600
And while Charles was given a
share, the bishops of the

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:18.633
realm also claimed a right
to judge the king by his

00:28:18.633 --> 00:28:19.900
performance.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:29.233
In 831, a rebellion, a second or
third rebellion, broke out.

00:28:29.233 --> 00:28:32.033
The sons of Louis the Pious,
although fighting against each

00:28:32.033 --> 00:28:34.533
other, allied.

00:28:34.533 --> 00:28:36.867
The Church regarded Louis,
now, as hopelessly

00:28:36.867 --> 00:28:40.833
ineffectual, incapable of
bringing order to the realm.

00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:48.400
And Louis was captured by his
sons, forced to abdicate both

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:55.800
by the Church and by Lothar
and Louis, his older sons.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.133
Lothar was so arrogant, however,
that by 834 Louis had

00:28:59.133 --> 00:29:00.467
been restored.

00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:07.100
I won't go into the complexities
of this.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.267
Suffice it to say that the
hapless, or at least unlucky,

00:29:10.267 --> 00:29:15.867
Louis the Pious, when he died
in 840, provoked another war

00:29:15.867 --> 00:29:17.900
of succession among his sons.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.367
Keep in mind that, meanwhile,
the administration of the

00:29:20.367 --> 00:29:25.567
empire is dissolving, and the
Viking invasions are occupying

00:29:25.567 --> 00:29:29.400
ever more attention, ineffectual
attention, and

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.367
plundering even more.

00:29:33.367 --> 00:29:41.533
After a series of battles and
campaigns, in 843, a third

00:29:41.533 --> 00:29:42.867
partition took place.

00:29:42.867 --> 00:29:45.333
But this one is really
important.

00:29:45.333 --> 00:29:50.033
This is the Treaty of Verdun,
V-E-R-D-U-N. And that's the

00:29:50.033 --> 00:29:54.800
third one on your map that
I have bold or, at least,

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:57.967
felt-tipped lines showing
the division.

00:29:57.967 --> 00:30:03.400
And then, on page two of the
handout, on the upper part, is

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.100
the division of Verdun.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.267
The Treaty of Verdun divided
the empire among the three

00:30:13.267 --> 00:30:18.333
sons of Louis the Pious,
three surviving sons.

00:30:18.333 --> 00:30:21.200
The western part went
to Charles the Bald.

00:30:24.233 --> 00:30:25.867
And you see that in
white, Neustria,

00:30:25.867 --> 00:30:27.500
Aquitaine, Spanish March.

00:30:31.967 --> 00:30:37.533
It is what can start to
be called France.

00:30:37.533 --> 00:30:40.433
The eastern part, which
is the darkest--

00:30:40.433 --> 00:30:46.467
Saxony, eastern Austrasia,
Alemania, Bavaria--

00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:50.833
went to Louis son, Louis,
also named Louis.

00:30:50.833 --> 00:30:54.600
Louis the German, as he's
known to historians.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:57.067
And he's known as Louis the
German in part because his

00:30:57.067 --> 00:31:00.833
sphere of influence was the
East, which we can start to

00:31:00.833 --> 00:31:02.067
call Germany.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.467
The eldest son, Lothar, got
the middle part, which

00:31:10.467 --> 00:31:13.867
stretches from what's now
the northern part of the

00:31:13.867 --> 00:31:18.867
Netherlands, Frisia, all the way
down to Rome, and even a

00:31:18.867 --> 00:31:20.400
little south of Rome, Spoleto.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.267
This is the most prestigious
and, in some ways, richest

00:31:30.267 --> 00:31:32.467
part of the Empire.

00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:36.633
It has Aachen, the imperial
capital, and it has Rome, the

00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:38.567
old imperial capital.

00:31:38.567 --> 00:31:45.500
It has the lands of the
Carolingians, most of them, in

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:50.267
the region of Aachen, in the
region of the Low Countries,

00:31:50.267 --> 00:31:51.500
modern Belgium.

00:31:55.833 --> 00:31:57.500
What's the problem
with this realm?

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.200
Or what's the obvious military,
political problems?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.533
Spence?

00:32:04.533 --> 00:32:08.133
STUDENT: The shape would be
exceedingly hard to defend.

00:32:08.133 --> 00:32:09.633
PROFESSOR: It
would be very hard to defend.

00:32:09.633 --> 00:32:12.633
It would be easy to cut
off and invade.

00:32:12.633 --> 00:32:17.867
And if we say that the western
part is France and we say that

00:32:17.867 --> 00:32:20.833
the eastern part is Germany,
using these terms

00:32:20.833 --> 00:32:24.567
anachronistically but not
inaccurately, what is the

00:32:24.567 --> 00:32:26.800
middle part?

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.367
The middle part is all that part
of Europe that has been

00:32:29.367 --> 00:32:31.567
fought over.

00:32:31.567 --> 00:32:33.733
All of World War I
[correction: that]

00:32:33.733 --> 00:32:37.067
takes place on the
Western Front.

00:32:37.067 --> 00:32:38.800
Most of it takes place
in the northern

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.067
part of realm of Lothar.

00:32:42.067 --> 00:32:47.833
The places where, like Belgium,
which this day, now,

00:32:47.833 --> 00:32:50.800
is bitterly divided between
French-speaking and

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.933
Flemish-speaking.

00:32:51.933 --> 00:32:55.833
In other words, people who speak
a Germanic language,

00:32:55.833 --> 00:33:00.367
descended from some ancestral
Germanic language, and those

00:33:00.367 --> 00:33:03.433
who speak French, descended
from Latin.

00:33:03.433 --> 00:33:05.433
That line runs right
through Belgium.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:15.533
And the same ambiguity pursues
this whole realm of Lothar's

00:33:15.533 --> 00:33:19.667
down into Switzerland, a modern
polity-- well, modern,

00:33:19.667 --> 00:33:21.633
late medieval and modern--

00:33:21.633 --> 00:33:25.967
where they speak four official
languages and are so unsure

00:33:25.967 --> 00:33:28.933
about which is the official one
that their stamps give the

00:33:28.933 --> 00:33:32.867
name of the country in Latin
and their airline gives its

00:33:32.867 --> 00:33:35.033
name in English.

00:33:35.033 --> 00:33:39.367
Their stamps call themselves
Helvetia.

00:33:39.367 --> 00:33:43.600
There has not been an entity
called that, really, in real

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.667
life terms, since the
Roman Empire.

00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:51.367
But that's better than having
all four language on there.

00:33:51.367 --> 00:33:53.500
It's more convenient.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:59.700
So there's a linguistic
ambiguity, there's a cultural

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.900
ambiguity, and there's a
political ambiguity.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.300
Because, of course, the
realm of Lothar didn't

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.367
hold up very long.

00:34:07.367 --> 00:34:11.800
Its strategic flaw was very
quickly manifested.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:16.767
It was divided, but
never permanently.

00:34:16.767 --> 00:34:20.500
Part of this realm would be
called what in French is

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.700
Lorraine but in German
is called Lothringen.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:32.333
Lothringen named after Lothar,
L-O-T-H-R-I-N-G-E-N. Alsace

00:34:32.333 --> 00:34:38.133
and Lorraine, these two
provinces, are now France.

00:34:38.133 --> 00:34:41.633
In 1870, they were
taken by Germany.

00:34:41.633 --> 00:34:45.300
After World War I, they were
taken back by France.

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:48.933
Under Hitler, they became
annexed to Germany.

00:34:48.933 --> 00:34:53.267
After World War II, they're
back with France.

00:34:53.267 --> 00:34:56.800
A substantial proportion of the
population of Alsace still

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.100
speaks German.

00:34:58.100 --> 00:35:03.867
And until about the seventy,
eighty years ago, a fairly

00:35:03.867 --> 00:35:07.333
significant proportion of
Lorraine did as well.

00:35:07.333 --> 00:35:13.333
The same kind of ambiguity as to
what are these territories.

00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:16.267
And in our world, they either
are neither France nor

00:35:16.267 --> 00:35:19.000
Germany-- hence, Belgium,
Netherlands, Switzerland--

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.533
or they've traded hands.

00:35:21.533 --> 00:35:24.600
It is not exactly accurate to
say that the political,

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:28.133
military history of Europe
since 843 is simply the

00:35:28.133 --> 00:35:32.033
unwinding of the consequences
of the Treaty of Verdun.

00:35:32.033 --> 00:35:36.367
But it's not completely
inaccurate to say that either.

00:35:36.367 --> 00:35:41.800
That doesn't mean that events
like the Reformation or the

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:45.300
second world war don't have
significance well beyond that.

00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:51.500
But just in terms of border
shifting and maps of Europe,

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:54.600
the legacy of Verdun
is tremendous.

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:57.733
If the legacy of Charlemagne
is, in some sense, the

00:35:57.733 --> 00:36:01.867
creation of a cultural realm
that can be referred to as

00:36:01.867 --> 00:36:06.567
Europe, the legacy of the sons
of Louis the Pious is the

00:36:06.567 --> 00:36:11.633
ambiguous division
of that realm.

00:36:11.633 --> 00:36:15.933
What this really means, then, in
ninth century terms-- since

00:36:15.933 --> 00:36:18.900
nobody said, wow, we're signing
the Treaty of Verdun.

00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:23.367
This is going to have
consequences for centuries--

00:36:23.367 --> 00:36:27.800
the immediate consequences were
the decreasing relevance,

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.567
the decreasing importance,
of the imperial title.

00:36:32.567 --> 00:36:37.500
When Lothar died and his eldest
son died soon after,

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:41.433
Lothar's realm was divided
between Louis and Charles.

00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:43.933
Then, Italy was left to
a son of Lothar's

00:36:43.933 --> 00:36:45.500
called Louis the Second.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.400
He took on the imperial title.

00:36:51.233 --> 00:36:56.300
But under Charles the Bald, the
third and much youngest

00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.700
son of Louis the Pious,
for a little while

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.233
the Empire was reunited.

00:37:00.233 --> 00:37:04.967
For a little while meaning,
basically, two years.

00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:11.967
When Charles died in 877,
the Empire would not be

00:37:11.967 --> 00:37:16.467
reestablished as unified
for almost a century.

00:37:16.467 --> 00:37:22.433
And when it was, it would really
consist of, basically,

00:37:22.433 --> 00:37:27.833
an enlarged Germany and a
portion of Italy, not France.

00:37:31.567 --> 00:37:36.700
And Charles, although he bore,
between 875 and 877, the grand

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:39.633
title of emperor and was
unchallenged within his own

00:37:39.633 --> 00:37:44.767
family, his rulership was
already severely undermined by

00:37:44.767 --> 00:37:48.600
the intrigues of his nobles
and the Vikings.

00:37:51.433 --> 00:37:56.133
By the time of his death, many
of the counties that had

00:37:56.133 --> 00:37:59.967
originally been administrative
divisions of the Empire has

00:37:59.967 --> 00:38:03.967
become almost independent.

00:38:03.967 --> 00:38:09.500
So for example, Barcelona,
conquered by Louis the Pious,

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:17.033
was now ruled after 868 by
a count who paid nominal

00:38:17.033 --> 00:38:22.767
allegiance to the ruler of the
western kingdom, but who was

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:25.233
the founder of a dynasty.

00:38:25.233 --> 00:38:29.100
Up to 868, therefore, you have
counts of Barcelona who are

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.900
appointed by the ruler.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:35.467
After 868, the ruler has very
little to do with it.

00:38:35.467 --> 00:38:37.467
It is a local ruler.

00:38:37.467 --> 00:38:41.833
And the count is no longer an
office holder but a ruler in

00:38:41.833 --> 00:38:43.333
his own right.

00:38:43.333 --> 00:38:46.533
Similar with Aquitaine.

00:38:46.533 --> 00:38:49.033
Similar with Bavaria.

00:38:49.033 --> 00:38:53.833
Similar with Poitou,
Toulouse, Flanders.

00:38:57.133 --> 00:39:00.667
The reason that the counts are
able to do this is the

00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:04.833
weakness of the central power,
not only because of the

00:39:04.833 --> 00:39:08.567
personality of the ruler, but
because of the inadequate

00:39:08.567 --> 00:39:10.100
nature of the administration.

00:39:14.867 --> 00:39:21.800
When Charles died, he was
succeeded by several rulers in

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:26.967
the West: Louis the Stammerer,
Louis the Third, who had the

00:39:26.967 --> 00:39:33.933
good fortune of just being Louis
the Third; and Carloman

00:39:33.933 --> 00:39:35.967
In Germany, the ruler
was Charles the Fat.

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:42.300
And he was elected is emperor
for, again, four years, but

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:44.667
was pretty utterly
ineffectual.

00:39:44.667 --> 00:39:48.567
And not because he was
fat, I hasten to add.

00:39:48.567 --> 00:39:55.167
The Middle Ages did not share
our prejudices in this regard.

00:39:55.167 --> 00:39:59.267
So Louis the Fat, in the twelfth
century, was a very

00:39:59.267 --> 00:40:02.433
effective king.

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:08.067
Fat or not, Charles, this
particular Charles was not an

00:40:08.067 --> 00:40:10.500
effective ruler.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.400
All of these rulers, as
I said, suffered the

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.933
depredations of the Vikings.

00:40:14.933 --> 00:40:18.433
But once again, I want to
emphasize that the problems of

00:40:18.433 --> 00:40:22.200
this empire, or the problems
of these separate kingdoms,

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.033
or, indeed, the problems of some
of the counties ruled by

00:40:26.033 --> 00:40:28.867
independent counts but affected
by the Vikings and

00:40:28.867 --> 00:40:31.633
other invaders, were internal.

00:40:31.633 --> 00:40:37.500
The Vikings were opportunistic
raiders, not the cause of the

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.767
dissolution of authority.

00:40:43.333 --> 00:40:45.433
The dissolution of authority
didn't mean that the

00:40:45.433 --> 00:40:47.233
Carolingians come to an end.

00:40:47.233 --> 00:40:49.800
Because by this time, in the
late ninth century, they have

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.167
some of the prestige that
the Merovingians

00:40:52.167 --> 00:40:54.133
had in their decline.

00:40:54.133 --> 00:40:58.300
In their veins flowed the
blood of Charlemagne.

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:02.267
They were a sacred dynasty.

00:41:02.267 --> 00:41:05.500
They had a certain
kind of prestige.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:10.033
So for example, they would be
kings of France, with some

00:41:10.033 --> 00:41:16.200
minor interruption, until 987.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:22.367
In Germany, the family ends in
911, and a new series of

00:41:22.367 --> 00:41:27.033
dynasties comes into effect.

00:41:27.033 --> 00:41:33.400
In 987, a new dynasty comes into
rule of France called the

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:38.800
Capetian dynasty,
C-A-P-E-T-I-A-N, which

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:45.533
technically runs out in 1314,
fourteen but which is related

00:41:45.533 --> 00:41:47.267
to the French kings since.

00:41:47.267 --> 00:41:52.133
And indeed, when Louis the XVI
was guillotined by the French

00:41:52.133 --> 00:41:56.900
Revolution, he was referred to
in the court documents as

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.900
"Louis Capet." In other words,
they gave him a kind of

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:04.900
artificial last name and regard
him as descended from

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:08.600
this ruler Hugh Capet,
C-A-P-E-T. Thus, a member of

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.833
the Capetian, C-A-P-E-T-I-A-N,
dynasty.

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:21.333
But the reality of France, and
even of Germany, in the 10th

00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:25.833
century would be as a series
of nearly independent

00:42:25.833 --> 00:42:32.867
principalities feuding,
only nominally

00:42:32.867 --> 00:42:35.533
controlled by the kings.

00:42:35.533 --> 00:42:40.733
The ruler, Hugh Capet, who
succeeded in 987, basically,

00:42:40.733 --> 00:42:42.233
he seems to have controlled
the road

00:42:42.233 --> 00:42:46.000
between Paris and Orleans.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.467
But in places that are now
public parks in Paris, like

00:42:50.467 --> 00:42:55.433
Vincennes, there were castles
not loyal to the king at all.

00:42:55.433 --> 00:43:02.600
So my little fantasy of a
fortified Cross Campus is not

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.667
so far-fetched, at least not
so far-fetched in terms of

00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:10.167
what really happened in places
like Paris, and indeed in, for

00:43:10.167 --> 00:43:16.100
example, the city of Arles in
southern France, there's a

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:21.300
wonderfully preserved Roman
stadium, Roman sports arena

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.400
that was fortified.

00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:31.533
That is, one family had the
bleachers and fought against

00:43:31.533 --> 00:43:36.833
the people who had the boxes
behind home plate.

00:43:36.833 --> 00:43:41.733
Not a classical term, but behind
what might have been

00:43:41.733 --> 00:43:44.900
considered home plate,
anachronistically.

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:48.967
And indeed, there are towers
built on top of this structure

00:43:48.967 --> 00:43:51.500
that were then demolished,
because they were medieval and

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.133
not classical.

00:43:53.133 --> 00:43:56.833
But they made use of
these materials.

00:43:56.833 --> 00:44:03.467
So we have a society in which
the power of the ruler has

00:44:03.467 --> 00:44:05.667
literally dissolved.

00:44:05.667 --> 00:44:10.733
Not dissolved into water, but
certainly crumble into much

00:44:10.733 --> 00:44:13.100
smaller components.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:17.400
Those components being,
essentially, a castle, or a

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.700
few castles, the territory
around it, the right to

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.433
exploit the peasants
around it.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:29.600
Maybe you would have an
effective regional ruler, like

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:34.767
the count of Barcelona or the
Count of Flanders, who would

00:44:34.767 --> 00:44:39.967
tie to himself these castellans,
the people who own

00:44:39.967 --> 00:44:43.233
or run the castle.

00:44:43.233 --> 00:44:46.367
But it is a society that
has become fragmented.

00:44:46.367 --> 00:44:48.200
It's not a barbarian society.

00:44:48.200 --> 00:44:50.800
These are not nomads.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.067
They're violent, but then again,
lots of societies run

00:44:54.067 --> 00:44:55.100
on violence.

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.200
It's a controlled kind
of violence.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:01.033
They want to squeeze the
peasants, even occasionally,

00:45:01.033 --> 00:45:02.633
perhaps, plunder them.

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:05.733
They don't want to have them go
away or exterminate them,

00:45:05.733 --> 00:45:08.267
because they don't have
any wealth otherwise.

00:45:08.267 --> 00:45:10.100
It is an exploitative society.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:14.733
But that, again, is not entirely
new or entirely

00:45:14.733 --> 00:45:19.500
unknown in other historical
periods and places.

00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:22.167
What it does bring up, however,
and which I'll try to

00:45:22.167 --> 00:45:25.000
address in our last class once
we've talked about the

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.200
Vikings, is what's been
accomplished.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:32.733
Here we are, from 300 AD to the
year 1000, and we're still

00:45:32.733 --> 00:45:34.867
talking about invasions.

00:45:34.867 --> 00:45:37.200
And we're still talking about
polities falling apart because

00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.667
they're too large.

00:45:38.667 --> 00:45:42.633
We're still talking about the
lack of administrative control

00:45:42.633 --> 00:45:45.533
over powerful individuals.

00:45:45.533 --> 00:45:48.600
So I promise you that something
was accomplished.

00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:52.267
And I will try to describe
that next time.

00:45:52.267 --> 00:45:54.667
But you're forgiven for thinking
that that, perhaps,

00:45:54.667 --> 00:45:57.833
we have wandered around
and not come very far.

00:45:57.833 --> 00:46:01.033
Have a very good Thanksgiving,
and I'll see you soon.

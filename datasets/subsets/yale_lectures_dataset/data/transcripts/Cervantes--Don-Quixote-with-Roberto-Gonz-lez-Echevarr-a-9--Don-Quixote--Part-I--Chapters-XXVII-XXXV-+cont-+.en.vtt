00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.960
Prof: I want you to
ponder,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:15.805
over the next few days,
what is commemorated on October

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:18.101
7,
the next October 7,

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.140
which will be next Wednesday.
 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.170
You get bonus points for your
midterm.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.309
If you know it right off the
top of your head already,

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:37.506
you can tell me,
if not, think about it and you

00:00:37.506 --> 00:00:40.740
may come up with it.
 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:46.187
It's something very relevant to
this course, and I can see that

00:00:46.187 --> 00:00:51.020
my TAs, the graduate students
are also puzzled by it.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.204
You can go home and google it,
and maybe it will come up,

00:00:57.204 --> 00:01:03.387
but we'll talk about it on
Tuesday, which will be the eve

00:01:03.387 --> 00:01:06.260
of the anniversary of?
 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.600
Okay.
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:17.260
We are going to talk today
mostly,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.096
but not exclusively,
about The Novel of the

00:01:21.096 --> 00:01:26.578
Curious Impertinent,
as you can anticipate by the

00:01:26.578 --> 00:01:30.209
various triangles on the board.
 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:36.938
Cervantes was criticized in his
time for the inclusion of this

00:01:36.938 --> 00:01:41.349
novel in Part I of the
Quixote.

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:50.420
He answered his critics through
his characters,

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.058
who speak about that criticism,
chiefly a character called

00:01:56.058 --> 00:02:01.206
Sansón Carrasco--
whom you will meet when you

00:02:01.206 --> 00:02:04.450
begin reading Part II very
soon--

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.990
and he also talks about it in
the prologue to Part II,

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:20.282
and Cervantes refrained from
inserting any novels like this

00:02:20.282 --> 00:02:22.590
in Part II.
 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.060
So he took the criticism to
heart.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.032
As I said in my last lecture,
Cervantes was trying to combine

00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:40.538
the sequential kind of plot of
the chivalric romance,

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:51.256
one adventure after another,
with the collection of stories

00:02:51.256 --> 00:02:56.430
in the style of Boccaccio.
 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:04.276
Boccaccio, I have mentioned
him, I think,

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:13.693
before, but if not,
Boccaccio, Giovanni Boccaccio

00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:16.438
1313-1375.
 

00:03:16.438 --> 00:03:20.198
If you're a literature major
you should know Boccaccio,

00:03:20.198 --> 00:03:23.400
or you should know at least
about Boccaccio.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.000
His famous work is called
the Decameron.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:39.979
 
 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:45.580
Now, not that the chivalric
romances didn't have convoluted

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.277
plots, but the insertion of a
novel like this was not one of

00:03:51.277 --> 00:03:52.919
its features.
 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:58.068
It is known that Cervantes
contemplated the publication of

00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:02.582
a collection of stories to be
called Semanas del

00:04:02.582 --> 00:04:07.056
jardín,
Weeks at the Garden,

00:04:07.056 --> 00:04:12.002
and he did publish,
in 1613, the collection of

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:16.336
stories that you have,
and from which you will read,

00:04:16.336 --> 00:04:20.420
called The Exemplary Novels,
Novelas Ejemplares.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.740
This collection,
as you will discover,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.012
does not have an overarching
fiction involving character

00:04:30.012 --> 00:04:34.790
narrators leaving the city,
fleeing the plague and

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.360
gathering to tell stories,
as in the Decameron.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.970
The overarching fiction in
the Decameron is that all

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.940
of these young people leave the
city because there is a plague,

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.644
they gather in a pleasant
place, and they each tell a

00:04:48.644 --> 00:04:51.653
story every day,
and that is the overarching

00:04:51.653 --> 00:04:53.490
fiction the Decameron.
 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.696
The Exemplary Novels of
Cervantes does not have such an

00:04:58.696 --> 00:05:02.000
overarching fiction,
it is just a collection of

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.149
stories by Miguel de Cervantes
with a prologue and so forth.

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:11.064
Weeks in the Garden or
Semanas del jardín

00:05:11.064 --> 00:05:16.399
does sound as it would have had
that kind of a plot,

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:21.000
meaning, overarching plot,
meaning that characters would

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.680
get together in a garden and
tell stories.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:29.528
The point is that in the
Quixote, Part I,

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:35.925
Cervantes is attempting to mesh
these two forms of narrative as

00:05:35.925 --> 00:05:37.060
I said.
 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:44.803
The result may seem awkward,
but it is mostly really very

00:05:44.803 --> 00:05:49.485
innovative,
and it leads to the creation of

00:05:49.485 --> 00:05:54.709
the modern novel,
with this very loose structure

00:05:54.709 --> 00:06:00.019
of which this kind of insertion
is possible.

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:06.348
Now, we saw how those
commingling stories about

00:06:06.348 --> 00:06:10.418
Fernando,
Dorotea, Cardenio and Luscinda,

00:06:10.418 --> 00:06:13.149
how those stories are
correlated,

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:16.860
and my colleague from the
Department of Comparative

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.654
Literature,
David Quint,

00:06:18.654 --> 00:06:20.860
calls it
"interlacing"--

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.769
how these stories are
interconnected--

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:27.959
in a fairly recent book on
Cervantes.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:31.240
And I proposed that they're
structured,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.240
they're all structured,
all of these stories,

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.704
with its cuts,
faults and gaps,

00:06:35.704 --> 00:06:39.399
was like a representation of
human memory,

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:43.829
human memory upon which fiction
depends,

00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:52.577
and on which the vary makeup of
the creative self of the author

00:06:52.577 --> 00:06:55.259
is based; memory.
 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:07:00.310
As we will see today and in the
next class,

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.035
the final resolution of the
conflicts in those stories is a

00:07:04.035 --> 00:07:08.552
narrative tour de force,
a veritable boast of artistry

00:07:08.552 --> 00:07:11.050
on the part of Cervantes.
 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.661
But The Novel of the Curious
Impertinent does stick out

00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:23.173
as being very different,
and apparently only tenuously

00:07:23.173 --> 00:07:28.699
related to the main plot and to
the other stories from which it

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:29.680
differs.
 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.940
Why is the story inserted here
in the Quixote?

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.247
You could say,
is it padding,

00:07:37.247 --> 00:07:42.449
is Cervantes padding his novel,
or does it have something to do

00:07:42.449 --> 00:07:47.173
with the intercalated stories
that we have been discussing and

00:07:47.173 --> 00:07:49.730
that are about to be resolved?
 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:55.641
First, let us go over how
Cervantes does justify the

00:07:55.641 --> 00:08:01.899
inclusion of the novel at the
most elementary level.

00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:04.466
The innkeeper,
Juan Palomeque,

00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:09.336
reveals that he keeps a
suitcase somebody left with some

00:08:09.336 --> 00:08:14.649
papers, and that he owns a
number of chivalric romances.

00:08:14.649 --> 00:08:17.990
This is the second suitcase we
find,

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.776
the first was Cardenio's,
which the characters found

00:08:21.776 --> 00:08:25.120
rotted in the middle of the
Sierra Morena,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:29.726
and it also contained writing,
contained Cardenio's

00:08:29.726 --> 00:08:32.879
manuscripts,
and poems, and some shirts,

00:08:32.879 --> 00:08:35.110
and most importantly for
Sancho,

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:37.740
some money.
 

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.456
A discussion ensues involving
the innkeeper,

00:08:41.456 --> 00:08:45.950
his wife and daughter,
and the priest about the value

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.580
of those books the chivalric
romances.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.938
This is a return to the
scrutiny of the books episode

00:08:54.938 --> 00:08:59.782
earlier, and the scrutiny of the
books, in fact,

00:08:59.782 --> 00:09:03.389
is mentioned by the characters.
 

00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:07.557
The priest wants to burn the
chivalric romances as he did

00:09:07.557 --> 00:09:10.982
with Don Quixote's,
but the innkeeper will have

00:09:10.982 --> 00:09:12.100
none of it.
 

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.308
Juan Palomeque,
as he says, he's not mad,

00:09:16.308 --> 00:09:19.575
he's not insane,
he knows that what those books

00:09:19.575 --> 00:09:23.125
relate happened a long time ago,
not in the present,

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.674
as Don Quixote does,
he knows that it is not

00:09:25.674 --> 00:09:27.220
applicable to the present.
 

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:31.107
In addition,
he maintains the romances of

00:09:31.107 --> 00:09:34.899
chivalry provide entertainment
when,

00:09:34.899 --> 00:09:38.765
at harvest time,
the workers gather around at

00:09:38.765 --> 00:09:43.284
the end of the day,
and someone reads out loud from

00:09:43.284 --> 00:09:44.370
one of them.
 

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:50.162
The tradition of reading out
loud goes back to the Middle

00:09:50.162 --> 00:09:54.092
Ages, and to convents,
and monasteries,

00:09:54.092 --> 00:09:59.678
and rituals of that kind and in
such institutions.

00:09:59.678 --> 00:10:09.836
He says that it provides solace
and rest, and relaxation at the

00:10:09.836 --> 00:10:12.129
end of work.
 

00:10:12.129 --> 00:10:17.269
The innkeeper's wife and
daughter, for their part,

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:20.840
are found of the love scenes
and they talk,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.902
particularly the daughter,
about the love scenes that

00:10:23.902 --> 00:10:25.080
moved her so much.
 

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:31.919
Juan Palomeque defends the
veracity of the chivalric

00:10:31.919 --> 00:10:34.928
romances,
saying that these books are

00:10:34.928 --> 00:10:37.730
published with the approval of
the crown's councils,

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.440
they have the stamp of the
crown council.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.442
How could the crown allow books
of lies to be published?--Of

00:10:45.442 --> 00:10:50.616
course, he has a very primitive
notion about printed books and

00:10:50.616 --> 00:10:51.720
so forth.
 

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:58.275
He is corrected by others--the
priest mostly--but to no avail,

00:10:58.275 --> 00:11:04.080
he still sticks to his guns,
but no books are burnt.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:07.240
Juan Palomeque's books are not
burnt.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:14.125
There will be soon another
scene with a character who is

00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:18.702
the Cannon of Toledo--
you will learn what the Cannon

00:11:18.702 --> 00:11:21.690
of Toledo or what a cannon is
when we get to that part--

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:25.537
in which the romances of
chivalry will,

00:11:25.537 --> 00:11:30.600
again, be discussed but at a
theoretical level,

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:36.870
by a very well educated and
well read characters like the

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.049
priest,
the Cannon of Toledo,

00:11:39.049 --> 00:11:40.480
and Don Quixote,
and so forth.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.745
But here Cervantes seems to be
emphasizing that the romances of

00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:49.230
chivalry do have a function in
society;

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:53.710
they furnish relaxation to the
common people.

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:58.784
It is foolish to take Cervantes
at his word when he says that he

00:11:58.784 --> 00:12:03.700
has written the Quixote
to demolish and banish romances

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.990
of chivalry.
 

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.418
There are people who still take
him at face value on that,

00:12:09.418 --> 00:12:11.734
but, in fact,
the Quixote,

00:12:11.734 --> 00:12:15.602
as with all parodies,
is both a critique and an

00:12:15.602 --> 00:12:18.759
homage to the romances of
chivalry,

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:21.785
and it is, perhaps,
the last of the romances of

00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:22.509
chivalry.
 

00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:28.048
So we must not take,
I don't think,

00:12:28.048 --> 00:12:32.215
Cervantes seriously when he
says that he wrote the book

00:12:32.215 --> 00:12:36.149
simply to do away with the
romances of chivalry--

00:12:36.149 --> 00:12:39.259
Remember, what I said before
that by his time,

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:44.460
essentially,
the fashion of publishing them,

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.548
anyway, had ended,
but they continued to be read,

00:12:47.548 --> 00:12:52.053
at least, if we take the
Quixote as evidence of their

00:12:52.053 --> 00:12:54.649
being read by the common people.
 

00:12:54.649 --> 00:12:59.412
Now, then the innkeeper speaks
about the papers in the suitcase

00:12:59.412 --> 00:13:02.311
and mentions the story,
The Novel of the Curious

00:13:02.311 --> 00:13:06.172
Impertinent, which,
he says, had been approvingly

00:13:06.172 --> 00:13:07.808
read at the inn.
 

00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:11.940
It had also been read out loud
at the inn.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.668
It is in manuscript form.
 

00:13:16.668 --> 00:13:20.399
Much literature,
including Cervantes's own

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:23.796
stories,
still circulated in manuscript

00:13:23.796 --> 00:13:27.870
even after the development of
the printing press,

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:32.330
as printing was complicated and
expensive.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:37.003
So you must not assume that
once printing became available

00:13:37.003 --> 00:13:41.840
literature did not circulate in
manuscript form any more.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:53.548
It did, and some of Cervantes's
work circulated in such fashion.

00:13:53.548 --> 00:13:57.144
Some of the stories that were
later included in The

00:13:57.144 --> 00:14:00.669
Exemplary Novels,
a book, had been circulating in

00:14:00.669 --> 00:14:01.620
this form.
 

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:07.019
This is, then,
another self-referential moment

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:09.899
in the Quixote.
 

00:14:09.899 --> 00:14:13.216
It is, to me,
clear, that it is Cervantes

00:14:13.216 --> 00:14:17.860
himself who left that suitcase
there with the manuscript,

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.090
and Cervantes is,
again, winking at the reader;

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:25.190
this is me who left this
suitcase here.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:30.149
It is clear too that he has
found a way to publish the story

00:14:30.149 --> 00:14:33.678
by inserting here in the
Quixote.

00:14:33.678 --> 00:14:36.899
That doesn't mean that he's
just padding the novel.

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:40.431
The long short story the
novella or

00:14:40.431 --> 00:14:44.480
nouvelle, in the manner
of Boccaccio,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.210
was a form with which Cervantes
felt very comfortable,

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:51.062
as you will discover when you
read The Exemplary

00:14:51.062 --> 00:14:53.355
Stories,
and as you have already

00:14:53.355 --> 00:14:56.038
discovered in these intercalated
stories,

00:14:56.038 --> 00:15:00.755
that this sort of long-short
story is a form that Cervantes

00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:01.570
favored.
 

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:08.355
Now, let us not miss the irony,
which is easy to miss--You have

00:15:08.355 --> 00:15:11.639
to read carefully,
remember?

00:15:11.639 --> 00:15:17.972
Read for details--The irony
that it is the priest who reads

00:15:17.972 --> 00:15:23.980
out loud The Novel of the
Curious Impertinent.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:29.298
This perverse,
twisted love story is told in

00:15:29.298 --> 00:15:34.990
the voice of a representative of
the Church.

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:39.466
This priest is a very
complicated character,

00:15:39.466 --> 00:15:45.668
as you are discovering;
he invents chivalric romances,

00:15:45.668 --> 00:15:51.668
and he is out in the fields
chasing Don Quixote,

00:15:51.668 --> 00:15:56.940
and it is--to me--very ironic,
that you have the priest

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:58.990
reading this story.
 

00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:04.058
Cervantes loves these ironic
games.

00:16:04.058 --> 00:16:09.956
It is the priest who at the end
does a critique of the story and

00:16:09.956 --> 00:16:13.889
asks permission to have it
copied later.

00:16:13.889 --> 00:16:17.759
Cervantes is engaging here in
some self criticism,

00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:21.053
but also in some self praise,
having one of his characters

00:16:21.053 --> 00:16:23.610
praise the story,
with some reservation,

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.330
but the priest praises it.
 

00:16:25.330 --> 00:16:27.984
This priest,
as we have already learned,

00:16:27.984 --> 00:16:31.863
is also a literary critic,
as we discovered in the episode

00:16:31.863 --> 00:16:34.110
of the scrutiny of the books.
 

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:38.855
Now, The Novel of the
Curious Impertinent is the

00:16:38.855 --> 00:16:44.570
most blatantly literary story
contained in the Quixote,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:51.668
the most artful and obviously
derived from literary sources.

00:16:51.668 --> 00:17:00.178
The action is set in Florence
and in a vaguely defined past.

00:17:00.178 --> 00:17:06.113
It is a time and place of
fictions, not the present in

00:17:06.113 --> 00:17:10.480
which the Quixote takes
place.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:20.150
It is drawn from known Italian
sources,

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:23.250
and written in the style of
Boccaccio--

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:40.190
whom you now know--and
Bandello, Matteo Bandello--

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.630
This course is under the ages
of the literature major,

00:17:42.630 --> 00:17:44.942
that is Comparative Literature,
so you are getting quite a bit

00:17:44.942 --> 00:17:51.112
of Italian literature here,
which is inevitable--Matteo

00:17:51.112 --> 00:17:54.838
Bandello 1485-1561.
 

00:17:54.838 --> 00:17:57.645
He was one of the great short
story writers already of the

00:17:57.645 --> 00:18:01.538
sixteenth century,
much read throughout Europe,

00:18:01.538 --> 00:18:05.432
and, in fact,
one of his stories inspired

00:18:05.432 --> 00:18:07.618
Romeo and Juliet.
 

00:18:07.618 --> 00:18:09.388
Shakespeare,
as you know,

00:18:09.388 --> 00:18:12.778
was very fond of reading
Italian literature.

00:18:12.778 --> 00:18:18.776
In fact, The Novel of the
Curious Impertinent is

00:18:18.776 --> 00:18:24.440
actually drawn from Ariosto's
Orlando furioso.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.009
I have mentioned Ariosto
several times,

00:18:27.009 --> 00:18:29.150
but I will mention him again
now.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:37.838
 
 

00:18:37.838 --> 00:18:44.500
His famous poem is Orlando
furioso.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.998
Ariosto is 1474-1533,
and the Orlando furioso

00:18:49.998 --> 00:18:54.848
was published in 1516,
then 1521, and 1532.

00:18:54.848 --> 00:18:59.352
It is a mock epic,
as I've mentioned before,

00:18:59.352 --> 00:19:04.272
is a mock epic poem that
Cervantes much admired,

00:19:04.272 --> 00:19:07.308
as we should know by now.
 

00:19:07.308 --> 00:19:14.218
So we have here these three
Italian authors that Cervantes

00:19:14.218 --> 00:19:16.400
was indebted to.
 

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:23.653
Other more distant sources have
been found, but Ariosto is the

00:19:23.653 --> 00:19:25.318
obvious one.
 

00:19:25.318 --> 00:19:29.970
One very distant source of the
story of a king,

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:32.358
who wanted to put his wife to
the test,

00:19:32.358 --> 00:19:36.808
and had somebody seduce her and
so forth,

00:19:36.808 --> 00:19:38.779
the same story,
but that is very remote,

00:19:38.779 --> 00:19:44.089
and the most obvious source is
a fragment from the Orlando

00:19:44.089 --> 00:19:45.328
furioso.
 

00:19:45.328 --> 00:19:50.369
I underscore,
again, Cervantes's indebtedness

00:19:50.369 --> 00:19:54.608
to Italian Renaissance
literature,

00:19:54.608 --> 00:19:59.279
as he was also to Italian
Renaissance art,

00:19:59.279 --> 00:20:02.450
as I mentioned in my last
lecture.

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:06.237
Remember, if you have been
reading the Casebook and

00:20:06.237 --> 00:20:09.128
your introductions,
that Cervantes spent a good

00:20:09.128 --> 00:20:11.980
deal of time in Italy,
which had been,

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:16.410
of course, the center of the
Renaissance.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:20.577
Now, The Novel of the
Curious Impertinent has been

00:20:20.577 --> 00:20:25.010
variously interpreted,
but the most apt analysis,

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:30.134
the most--
How could I say?--current

00:20:30.134 --> 00:20:34.450
analysis,
the most accepted,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:39.250
is the one by René
Girard.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:48.710
Now we have a French name.
 

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:53.806
Girard was a French professor
who taught in the United States

00:20:53.806 --> 00:20:55.930
nearly all of his life.
 

00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:00.277
His most famous book was called
in the original Mensonge

00:21:00.277 --> 00:21:02.750
romantique et
vérité

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.287
romanesque,
known in English as Deceit,

00:21:07.287 --> 00:21:09.920
Desire and the Novel.
 

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.490
The original,
the first publication,

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.298
was 1961.
 

00:21:13.298 --> 00:21:19.234
Girard's whole theory revolves
around the concept of triangular

00:21:19.234 --> 00:21:21.150
or mimetic desire.
 

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:27.654
This desire is both external,
what it applies to a novel and

00:21:27.654 --> 00:21:30.884
its sources,
the previous books that it

00:21:30.884 --> 00:21:32.579
imitates,
and internal,

00:21:32.579 --> 00:21:36.779
when it applies to the
protagonist's love relations.

00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:40.775
And, in fact,
Girard will claim that all

00:21:40.775 --> 00:21:44.821
novels contain,
the kernel of all novels,

00:21:44.821 --> 00:21:48.700
is this kind of mimetic
triangular desire,

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:52.382
and his book contains analysis
of famous novels in the European

00:21:52.382 --> 00:21:54.640
tradition like Madam
Bovary,

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.640
Le Rouge et le Noir,
and so forth.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:00.640
I much recommend his book.
 

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.188
Now, the story by Cervantes,
The Novel of the Curious

00:22:05.188 --> 00:22:09.736
Impertinent, is
crucial to the development of

00:22:09.736 --> 00:22:12.968
Girard' theory,
and indeed it may have inspired

00:22:12.968 --> 00:22:15.338
his theory,
it is that important.

00:22:15.338 --> 00:22:17.798
Girard writes,
and this, I know,

00:22:17.798 --> 00:22:22.238
is a little dense quotation
translated from French into a

00:22:22.238 --> 00:22:24.380
little awkward English.
 

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:29.019
I'll read it very slowly so
that you can follow it.

00:22:29.019 --> 00:22:32.731
He says: "The existence of
The Novel of the Curious

00:22:32.731 --> 00:22:36.381
Impertinent in the
Quixote has always intrigued

00:22:36.381 --> 00:22:37.150
critics.
 

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:41.457
The question arises whether the
short story is compatible with

00:22:41.457 --> 00:22:45.200
the novel, the unity of the
masterpiece seems somewhat

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:46.328
compromised.
 

00:22:46.328 --> 00:22:49.991
It is this unity which I
revealed by our journey through

00:22:49.991 --> 00:22:53.520
novelistic literature [his
journey in the book through

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.462
novelistic literature,
in which he shows that this

00:22:56.462 --> 00:22:58.578
triangular desire exists in all
of these novels].

00:22:58.578 --> 00:23:01.260
Having begun with Cervantes,
[he begins his book with

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.170
Cervantes]
we return to Cervantes,

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:08.777
and ascertain that this novel
is genius as grasped the extreme

00:23:08.777 --> 00:23:11.259
forms of imitated desire.
 

00:23:11.259 --> 00:23:16.530
No small distance separates the
Cervantes of Don Quixote and the

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.954
Cervantes of Anselmo,
since all of the novels we have

00:23:20.954 --> 00:23:24.150
considered in this chapter as
they show.

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:27.070
Yet, the distance is not
insuperable since all of the

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.150
novelists are linked to each
other.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:32.559
The simultaneous presence of
external and internal mediation

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:36.144
in the same work seems to us to
confirm the unity of novelistic

00:23:36.144 --> 00:23:37.810
literature,
and in turn,

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.460
the unity of this literature
confirms that of Don Quixote.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.056
One is proof by the other,
just as one proves that the

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:47.500
earth is round by going around
it.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:52.942
The creative force of Cervantes
is so great that it has been

00:23:52.942 --> 00:23:58.568
exerted effortlessly throughout
the whole novelistic space.

00:23:58.568 --> 00:24:02.621
All of the ideas of the western
novel are present in germ in Don

00:24:02.621 --> 00:24:03.650
Quixote."
 

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.505
I continue reading Girard:
"And the idea of these

00:24:07.505 --> 00:24:10.046
ideas,
the idea whose central role is

00:24:10.046 --> 00:24:13.987
constantly being confirmed,
the basic idea from which one

00:24:13.987 --> 00:24:17.930
can rediscover everything is
triangular desire."

00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:20.568
That's the end of the quote.
 

00:24:20.568 --> 00:24:24.545
I'm sure this sounds very
strange and obscure to you if

00:24:24.545 --> 00:24:27.269
you haven't heard about it
before,

00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:30.190
but I tell you,
once you understand it,

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:33.568
you may glean something useful
about your love life.

00:24:33.568 --> 00:24:38.740
I said that reading the
Quixote would provide

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.868
lessons for living.
 

00:24:40.868 --> 00:24:44.646
When I was a graduate student
this book was the rage,

00:24:44.646 --> 00:24:49.077
and everyone was interpreting
his or her love relationships in

00:24:49.077 --> 00:24:51.328
terms of triangular desire.
 

00:24:51.328 --> 00:24:56.519
So, you don't have to make any
confessions at the end of the

00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:59.373
course but you might,
if you want,

00:24:59.373 --> 00:25:03.338
tell me if this has helped you
in any way understand your life.

00:25:03.338 --> 00:25:09.759
For Girard, desire is never
spontaneous,

00:25:09.759 --> 00:25:14.616
it's never a spontaneous
one-to-one relationship but

00:25:14.616 --> 00:25:17.509
mediated,
one desires a man or woman

00:25:17.509 --> 00:25:20.269
because he or she is desired by
another.

00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:27.140
It is that presumed desire by
the mediator that makes her or

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:29.118
him attractive.
 

00:25:29.118 --> 00:25:32.801
I say "presume"
because then the mediator's

00:25:32.801 --> 00:25:36.910
desire must yet have another
mediator to exist as such,

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.650
and then there will be sort of
an endless series of mediations,

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:43.630
but we're focusing on one
triangle at a time.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:49.807
Jealousy, in other words,
is a requirement for desire,

00:25:49.807 --> 00:25:51.088
for love.
 

00:25:51.088 --> 00:25:53.700
You can now think of all of the
novels you have read in which

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.440
jealousy plays such an important
role.

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.750
Proust is full of jealous
characters.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:06.825
Hence imitation of the
mediator, the one of whom one is

00:26:06.825 --> 00:26:09.852
jealous,
is of the essence,

00:26:09.852 --> 00:26:14.537
because of the belief that she
or he is loved by the object of

00:26:14.537 --> 00:26:17.568
our desire--
if you follow that.

00:26:17.568 --> 00:26:22.105
This is the mimetic part of
desire, which may lead to desire

00:26:22.105 --> 00:26:26.873
for the mediator in the guise of
desire for the original object

00:26:26.873 --> 00:26:27.950
of desire.
 

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.834
That is, you love so much the
mediator that you wind up loving

00:26:31.834 --> 00:26:34.573
the mediator,
not loving the person that you

00:26:34.573 --> 00:26:36.420
thought you began loving.
 

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.990
We'll see some of that in
The Novel of the Curious

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:43.596
Impertinent.
In the context of The Novel

00:26:43.596 --> 00:26:49.828
of the Curious Impertinent
it works like this.

00:26:49.828 --> 00:26:57.509
We begin here and you have your
handout for easy reference.

00:26:57.509 --> 00:27:04.517
Anselmo cannot love really
Camila until he gets Lotario to

00:27:04.517 --> 00:27:05.868
love her.
 

00:27:05.868 --> 00:27:11.778
This is the gist of this man's
twisted desire,

00:27:11.778 --> 00:27:16.769
and why he must put her to the
test.

00:27:16.769 --> 00:27:23.401
So Anselmo loves Camila,
but once Lotario is inserted as

00:27:23.401 --> 00:27:25.210
the mediator.
 

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:29.980
Then, eventually,
when Lotario loves Camila,

00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:35.641
he does so--a second
triangle--because she has loved

00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:37.750
Anselmo before.
 

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:41.230
So we have these two triangles.
 

00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:51.098
Now, this story may well reveal
a hidden substory of the kind we

00:27:51.098 --> 00:27:57.041
have been finding,
when characters tell stories,

00:27:57.041 --> 00:28:02.596
and the story may very well be,
and it has been proposed,

00:28:02.596 --> 00:28:07.058
a homosexual love between the
two friends,

00:28:07.058 --> 00:28:11.930
using Camila as the mediator,
the third triangle,

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:18.318
Anselmo really loves Lotario
using Camila as the mediator.

00:28:18.318 --> 00:28:28.519
Nicolás Wey-Gómez
has written a persuasive

00:28:28.519 --> 00:28:31.885
article,
not only about that

00:28:31.885 --> 00:28:35.916
relationship between the two,
but also showing that Anselmo's

00:28:35.916 --> 00:28:38.563
illnesses,
both physical,

00:28:38.563 --> 00:28:44.743
psychosomatic,
are feminine in the medicine of

00:28:44.743 --> 00:28:49.413
the time,
to underscore the nature of the

00:28:49.413 --> 00:28:52.390
relationship between these two.
 

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:56.544
So I hope that you are
understanding all of this and I

00:28:56.544 --> 00:28:59.680
hope it's not ruining your love
life,

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:05.478
or your life in general,
by realizing how complicated

00:29:05.478 --> 00:29:07.038
love can be.
 

00:29:07.038 --> 00:29:12.869
Now, this structure sheds light
on the intertwined stories that

00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:18.593
we have been discussing,
and this is why I have these

00:29:18.593 --> 00:29:24.960
other triangles here on the
board and on your handout,

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:31.608
whereas where we have the
Fernando,

00:29:31.608 --> 00:29:37.179
Cardenio, Luscinda triangle,
in which Fernando loves

00:29:37.179 --> 00:29:40.702
Luscinda,
really because she is

00:29:40.702 --> 00:29:45.640
Cardenio's girl,
or is going to be his girl.

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:49.913
Eventually, and I suggested
this in another class,

00:29:49.913 --> 00:29:54.624
there are intimations of a
homoerotic relationship here

00:29:54.624 --> 00:29:57.588
between Fernando and Cardenio.
 

00:29:57.588 --> 00:30:02.910
Now, Fernando,
when it comes to Dorotea,

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:08.772
Fernando loses interest in
Dorotea once he has possessed

00:30:08.772 --> 00:30:11.742
her,
because there is no mediation,

00:30:11.742 --> 00:30:15.183
but he marries her,
once she appears at the inn

00:30:15.183 --> 00:30:16.720
defended by Cardenio.
 

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.880
So once Cardenio appears as a
potential mediator,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:28.269
Fernando goes ahead and marries
Dorotea.

00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:37.020
Now, Don Quixote's mediations
are the romances of chivalry and

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.663
its heroes,
particularly,

00:30:39.663 --> 00:30:41.710
Amadís de Gaula whom he
imitates,

00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:45.670
as he also imitates Orlando in
the Orlando furioso.

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.554
The object of his love,
Dulcinea, is a projection of

00:30:48.554 --> 00:30:50.588
the loves of those famous
lovers,

00:30:50.588 --> 00:30:52.769
Oriana in the case of
Amadís,

00:30:52.769 --> 00:30:55.883
Angelica in the case of
Orlando, which is why he desires

00:30:55.883 --> 00:30:57.313
her,
and in a way,

00:30:57.313 --> 00:31:01.210
invents her from their own
constructions of her.

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:05.681
And we will see her
transformations as the novel

00:31:05.681 --> 00:31:10.534
progresses, which are
remarkable, especially in Part

00:31:10.534 --> 00:31:11.200
II.
 

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:19.295
Now, The Novel of the
Curious Impertinent holds up

00:31:19.295 --> 00:31:23.252
a mirror,
the mirror of literature to the

00:31:23.252 --> 00:31:27.125
young people involved in love
stories that are about to

00:31:27.125 --> 00:31:28.920
culminate in marriage.
 

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:33.654
It provides a contrast to the
comedy like ending of the

00:31:33.654 --> 00:31:38.390
stories of Fernando,
Dorotea, Cardenio and Luscinda.

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:42.279
The Novel of the Curious
Impertinent is not so much

00:31:42.279 --> 00:31:44.963
an admonition,
though it is that too,

00:31:44.963 --> 00:31:48.567
as a lesson about the
complexities of love and how no

00:31:48.567 --> 00:31:51.339
permanent stability can be
achieved,

00:31:51.339 --> 00:31:52.920
particularly, not by marriage.
 

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.141
It is also a wink at the
reader, I think,

00:31:56.141 --> 00:31:57.509
a wake up call.
 

00:31:57.509 --> 00:32:01.942
I mean, can anyone--you will
see one who does soon--but can

00:32:01.942 --> 00:32:06.375
anyone really believe in the
sincerity of the permanence of

00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:08.670
Don Fernando's conversion?
 

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:14.609
Is it likely that Fernando will
be a faithful husband?

00:32:14.609 --> 00:32:16.558
What about Luscinda?
 

00:32:16.558 --> 00:32:21.118
She was tempted once by money
and status, and could be again.

00:32:21.118 --> 00:32:26.778
Literature teaches through
pleasure a very harsh lesson.

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:32.238
Ultimately, The Novel of the
Curious Impertinent is

00:32:32.238 --> 00:32:35.359
about,
in my view, the death instinct

00:32:35.359 --> 00:32:41.038
concealed within desire,
co-evil, with it, with love.

00:32:41.038 --> 00:32:43.880
It is what Freud called the
death drive.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.000
There is no stability where
there is desire.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.671
The perfection of a
socio-erotic situation of

00:32:51.671 --> 00:32:56.678
Anselmo, Camila and Lotario is a
mirage, and an invitation to

00:32:56.678 --> 00:32:57.680
tragedy.
 

00:32:57.680 --> 00:33:02.640
This is an even harsher lesson
about the human condition.

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.971
What the priest says at the end
is that he finds the story well

00:33:06.971 --> 00:33:10.821
written,
but he cannot believe--that the

00:33:10.821 --> 00:33:15.960
author has not shown--
a real situation because a

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.140
husband would never do that.
 

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:24.178
That maybe young people in love
before marriage would,

00:33:24.178 --> 00:33:26.078
but not a husband.
 

00:33:26.078 --> 00:33:30.898
What he's saying there is
something that is a given in all

00:33:30.898 --> 00:33:35.119
Golden Age Spanish literature,
and the given is that

00:33:35.119 --> 00:33:39.548
everything that happens before
marriage is the stuff of comedy,

00:33:39.548 --> 00:33:43.063
and everything that happens
after marriage is the stuff of

00:33:43.063 --> 00:33:43.680
tragedy.
 

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:49.660
This is not a lesson to be
taken too seriously,

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:56.808
but it's something to be
pondered, and I think that this

00:33:56.808 --> 00:34:00.838
is what the priest notices.
 

00:34:00.838 --> 00:34:05.886
He notices that this,
to him, would not be possible

00:34:05.886 --> 00:34:11.969
for a husband to do,
to subject his wife to this

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:15.836
sort of test,
but if it were among people not

00:34:15.836 --> 00:34:20.219
married yet,
it may be.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:27.150
Of course, marriage is usually
the ending of a comedy.

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:31.418
Comedies tend to end in
marriage because marriage is a

00:34:31.418 --> 00:34:36.061
return to stability;
and in theater comedy is a

00:34:36.061 --> 00:34:43.021
return to an order that has been
upset, whereas tragedy does not

00:34:43.021 --> 00:34:45.119
return to order.
 

00:34:45.119 --> 00:34:50.193
So this is what the literary
side of that would be,

00:34:50.193 --> 00:34:56.382
whether it is applicable or not
to life, it is for each one of

00:34:56.382 --> 00:34:58.309
us to discover.
 

00:34:58.309 --> 00:35:05.846
So now we move to the ending of
all of these stories at the Juan

00:35:05.846 --> 00:35:08.000
Palomeque's inn.
 

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.454
Fernando accepts Dorotea after
everyone pleads with him and a

00:35:12.454 --> 00:35:15.275
good deal surfaces about the
concept of

00:35:15.275 --> 00:35:19.360
hidalguía,
from hidalgo;

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:26.230
hidalguía.
 

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:31.628
He pleads her case with as much
verve as Marcela did in an

00:35:31.628 --> 00:35:37.501
earlier episode and with a very
thorough knowledge of Castilian

00:35:37.501 --> 00:35:38.260
law.
 

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:47.349
She is lacking
hidalguía--

00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:50.530
Dorotea--nobility,
but hidalguía is

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:53.692
passed on through the male line,
not the female line,

00:35:53.692 --> 00:35:55.039
as we've mentioned here before.
 

00:35:55.039 --> 00:35:57.039
This is what she underscores in
her own defense.

00:35:57.039 --> 00:36:00.253
Cardenio has his Luscinda,
who has the

00:36:00.253 --> 00:36:05.289
hidalguía,
but not the wealth Dorotea has.

00:36:05.289 --> 00:36:08.664
So there is,
as I mentioned in the earlier

00:36:08.664 --> 00:36:13.686
class, sort of a crisscrossing
here, a mirror image of the two

00:36:13.686 --> 00:36:14.510
women.
 

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:19.101
That is, Dorotea has no
nobility but has money,

00:36:19.101 --> 00:36:24.592
and Luscinda has very little
money but she has nobility,

00:36:24.592 --> 00:36:26.289
and so forth.
 

00:36:26.289 --> 00:36:29.659
Luscinda, by the way,
in the midst of all of this,

00:36:29.659 --> 00:36:34.512
had been kidnapped from a
convent and brought to the inn

00:36:34.512 --> 00:36:39.630
in what turns out to be a side
story not told in detail.

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:43.646
These stories could be extended
ad infinitum if you

00:36:43.646 --> 00:36:46.682
pursued every one of them,
but remember,

00:36:46.682 --> 00:36:51.114
Luscinda had been kidnapped and
she's brought back for this

00:36:51.114 --> 00:36:51.880
ending.
 

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:54.154
Javier Herrero,
whom I mentioned in the last

00:36:54.154 --> 00:36:57.626
class,
and I mention him here,

00:36:57.626 --> 00:37:04.664
again, with respect and
sometimes to disagree with good

00:37:04.664 --> 00:37:08.809
old Javier,
who is a very--was,

00:37:08.809 --> 00:37:15.313
he's retired now--
a very competent critic and

00:37:15.313 --> 00:37:19.942
also, I should say,
very Catholic critic,

00:37:19.942 --> 00:37:22.730
as you will understand from
what I read here;

00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:24.869
there's no sin in that.
 

00:37:24.869 --> 00:37:29.751
Javier Herrero interprets in
this way the battle of the wine

00:37:29.751 --> 00:37:34.219
skins that leads to the
resolution of the conflicts.

00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:38.195
He also has a kind of symbolic,
sexual symbolic interpretation

00:37:38.195 --> 00:37:42.018
of the whole thing,
but it's good to hear it to

00:37:42.018 --> 00:37:46.590
correct it a little bit,
but to learn from it.

00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:49.309
He says: "The meaning of
the battle against the wine

00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:51.690
skins is now clear [he has been
expostulating].

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:56.130
Don Quixote is in a state of
hallucination since he is really

00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:00.570
possessed by an intense dream
and acting with closed eyes.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:04.639
Takes two superimposed wine
skins which he saw in his room

00:38:04.639 --> 00:38:08.994
when he went to bed to be the
giant Pandafilando and to behead

00:38:08.994 --> 00:38:12.880
him he cuts the head around,
and pierces the body.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:16.369
The wine floods the room and
fills the inn with its smell.

00:38:16.369 --> 00:38:20.188
Don Quixote has destroyed an
erect penis [this is what good

00:38:20.188 --> 00:38:23.414
old Javier writes]
and has filled the inn with the

00:38:23.414 --> 00:38:24.599
smell of wine.
 

00:38:24.599 --> 00:38:27.603
Don Quixote has certainly cut
down the power of lust [I'm

00:38:27.603 --> 00:38:30.666
still quoting Herrero],
this blood transformed into

00:38:30.666 --> 00:38:34.059
wine must certainly be taken as
a sacramental symbol,

00:38:34.059 --> 00:38:37.297
a symbol of the mysterious
power of the knight against the

00:38:37.297 --> 00:38:38.489
amorous pestilence.
 

00:38:38.489 --> 00:38:41.625
Metaphorically,
the courage and courtesy of Don

00:38:41.625 --> 00:38:45.510
Quixote have vanquished the
arrogance, cruelty and lust of

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.670
Don Fernando.
 

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:49.969
It is true that Don Quixote is
wrong,

00:38:49.969 --> 00:38:52.059
that his adventures have
created havoc,

00:38:52.059 --> 00:38:54.440
and morally,
his motivation is mixed,

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.219
but it is also undeniable that
his courage,

00:38:57.219 --> 00:38:59.579
truthful and chaste,
his foolishness,

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:03.141
brings him blows and ridicule
but his greatness makes him a

00:39:03.141 --> 00:39:05.599
worthy instrument of
Providence."

00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:11.376
Herrero goes on:
"We see clearly that the

00:39:11.376 --> 00:39:15.429
spiritual movement has been
completed by Don Fernando's

00:39:15.429 --> 00:39:19.483
descent from lust and pride to a
Christian humility and

00:39:19.483 --> 00:39:23.987
fraternity by which he raises
his victims to the level of his

00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:27.016
affection,
and now reunited in love,

00:39:27.016 --> 00:39:29.030
a common embrace is possible.
 

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:33.152
The giant is dead and the true
man, the Christian gentleman has

00:39:33.152 --> 00:39:35.947
replaced him,
but which powers have brought

00:39:35.947 --> 00:39:37.610
about the conversion?
 

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:41.155
Has it been the beauty,
the tears, the truths of

00:39:41.155 --> 00:39:41.909
Dorotea?
 

00:39:41.909 --> 00:39:44.309
The priest's persuasion?
 

00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:46.460
They certainly all have a part
in it,

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:49.590
but the text leaves no doubt
that all these elements,

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.632
together with Don Quixote,
have been the instruments of

00:39:53.632 --> 00:39:56.030
Providence [with a capital P].
 

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:57.786
While men and women [he goes
on]

00:39:57.786 --> 00:40:01.018
had been acting through the
impulse of their passions,

00:40:01.018 --> 00:40:03.760
which brought them to the
labyrinth of the Sierra Morena,

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.929
not a reference has been made
by Cervantes to Heaven's will,

00:40:07.929 --> 00:40:11.594
but as soon as Cardenio meets
Dorotea and is told that Don

00:40:11.594 --> 00:40:14.360
Fernando did not take Luscinda
with him,

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:18.010
he expresses hope that Heaven
has decreed their salvation.

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:20.985
From that moment on,
their destinies began to escape

00:40:20.985 --> 00:40:23.960
from the darkness and confusion
of the labyrinth.

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.855
At the inn, the locus of social
reunion and consequently of the

00:40:27.855 --> 00:40:30.619
transition from wildness to
civilization,

00:40:30.619 --> 00:40:34.474
Luscinda, having been released
by Don Fernando in the scene

00:40:34.474 --> 00:40:37.219
just as described,
exclaims [he's quoting

00:40:37.219 --> 00:40:39.490
Luscinda]
â€˜observe how Heaven by

00:40:39.490 --> 00:40:43.235
unusual and to us hidden ways
has brought me into the presence

00:40:43.235 --> 00:40:46.755
of my true husband,
and well you know by a thousand

00:40:46.755 --> 00:40:50.471
dear-bought experiences that
death along can efface him out

00:40:50.471 --> 00:40:51.559
of my memory.'
 

00:40:51.559 --> 00:40:52.963
[Herrero goes on].
 

00:40:52.963 --> 00:40:57.483
Immediately and in the long
scene of reconciliation all the

00:40:57.483 --> 00:41:01.693
participants claim that their
meeting in the inn is not

00:41:01.693 --> 00:41:04.190
accidental,
but on the contrary the work of

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.869
Providence."
 

00:41:04.869 --> 00:41:08.771
The question to be considered
is if the conflicts would have

00:41:08.771 --> 00:41:12.409
been solved without the
intervention of Don Quixote--

00:41:12.409 --> 00:41:15.150
which I will speak about in a
minute,

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:17.230
I think that he was the agent,
of course.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:21.440
In any case,
Herrero winds up his article,

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.349
which ultimately deals with the
whole issue of marriage,

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:26.344
which is so important in the
Quixote and so important in

00:41:26.344 --> 00:41:30.023
the sixteenth century,
and about whom the likes of

00:41:30.023 --> 00:41:34.141
Erasmus and Vives wrote,
as he quotes them,

00:41:34.141 --> 00:41:37.465
and the Council of Trent,
which is taking place--as you

00:41:37.465 --> 00:41:38.465
know,
from reading

00:41:38.465 --> 00:41:41.952
Elliot--discussed--we will talk
about again when we talk about

00:41:41.952 --> 00:41:44.880
Part II--
about marriages and all of

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:50.054
that, because marriage is at the
core of social stability and

00:41:50.054 --> 00:41:55.634
social transitions in society;
it is the way that society

00:41:55.634 --> 00:41:59.000
renews itself,
so it's crucial.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.173
So this is what Herrero writes,
and it's important because he's

00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:08.264
bringing in first the
Neo-Platonic notions of love

00:42:08.264 --> 00:42:12.018
derived from the courtly love
tradition--

00:42:12.018 --> 00:42:16.239
that I think I've spoken
about--against sort of certain

00:42:16.239 --> 00:42:21.239
movement in Spanish society and
in sixteenth-century society,

00:42:21.239 --> 00:42:25.521
and philosophy in general,
towards a more bourgeois sense

00:42:25.521 --> 00:42:27.748
of marriage--
You remember,

00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:32.309
I think I've spoken about the
courtly love tradition,

00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:35.150
the courtly love tradition,
which is one of the great--

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.320
how could I say?
 

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.530
spiritual revolutions in the
West,

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:46.329
is the idea that the woman had
to be adored at a distance,

00:42:46.329 --> 00:42:48.929
the love could not be
consummated, usually,

00:42:48.929 --> 00:42:52.295
the love was for a woman who
was unattainable preferably

00:42:52.295 --> 00:42:55.105
married,
and the lover paid homage to

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:57.389
the woman,
and so forth.

00:42:57.389 --> 00:43:02.724
We still hear the echoes of the
courtly love tradition in modern

00:43:02.724 --> 00:43:05.603
poetry, in Neruda,
and Octavio Paz,

00:43:05.603 --> 00:43:08.230
and the great modern poets.
 

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:13.376
Don Quixote is a courtly lover
in that sense,

00:43:13.376 --> 00:43:20.748
an aged, out of fashion courtly
lover, but that is what inspires

00:43:20.748 --> 00:43:23.789
his love for Dulcinea.
 

00:43:23.789 --> 00:43:28.583
Neo-Platonism,
of course, was at the core of

00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:31.929
this courtly love tradition.
 

00:43:31.929 --> 00:43:37.643
So Herrero says the following,
now that I think that I've

00:43:37.643 --> 00:43:41.929
placed this in its ideological
context:

00:43:41.929 --> 00:43:45.760
"Against a sentimental and
Neo-Platonic tradition,

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:50.509
which made of woman a goddess,
Cervantes takes the side of the

00:43:50.509 --> 00:43:54.791
conjugal love presented by
Erasmus and Vives [Erasmus of

00:43:54.791 --> 00:43:57.907
Rotterdam,
I will speak more about him in

00:43:57.907 --> 00:44:01.213
the following classes;
he was a very important

00:44:01.213 --> 00:44:04.920
sixteenth century humanist and
so was Vives],

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:08.800
which allows man not only to
enjoy the legitimate pleasure of

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.619
the sexual union but to help
each other to fight against the

00:44:12.619 --> 00:44:15.724
inevitable weakness and
imperfection of the human

00:44:15.724 --> 00:44:16.760
condition.
 

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.000
By emphasizing the social
civilizing aspects of marriage,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.762
Cervantes was closer to the new
doctrines of reform than to the

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:29.063
Renaissance ideals of love [he's
thinking of Petrarch and

00:44:29.063 --> 00:44:33.518
Garcilaso and the poets that I
have mentioned before].

00:44:33.518 --> 00:44:36.876
Indeed, with this attacks on
the pastoral and by the story of

00:44:36.876 --> 00:44:40.277
El curioso impertinente,
[The Novel of the Curious

00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:42.739
Impertinent]
Cervantes is precisely marking

00:44:42.739 --> 00:44:45.735
his distance from the great
aristocratic tradition of the

00:44:45.735 --> 00:44:49.416
Renaissance and joining the new,
to a great extent bourgeois,

00:44:49.416 --> 00:44:53.125
Christianity which descended to
the south of Europe from the low

00:44:53.125 --> 00:44:53.889
countries.
 

00:44:53.889 --> 00:44:56.567
In opposition to Amadís,
Palmerín,

00:44:56.567 --> 00:44:59.585
Belianís [these are the
chivalric heroes of the

00:44:59.585 --> 00:45:03.036
chivalric romances],
the new bourgeois lover is not

00:45:03.036 --> 00:45:05.260
a knight,
but a Christian gentleman.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.518
Such love, as we have seen,
has two elements.

00:45:07.518 --> 00:45:10.577
It is Christian and the
activity of Providence and the

00:45:10.577 --> 00:45:13.806
priests show the role that God
and his Church play in its

00:45:13.806 --> 00:45:16.277
growth,
but it's also gentlemanly,

00:45:16.277 --> 00:45:19.900
both Cardenio and Don Fernando
become through love,

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:22.119
not only Christians,
but Christian gentlemen.

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:27.427
Courtly love brings the knight
to madness, but Christian love

00:45:27.427 --> 00:45:28.489
saves him.
 

00:45:28.489 --> 00:45:32.297
Such a rescue is metaphorically
expressed in our story by the

00:45:32.297 --> 00:45:34.900
great classical myth of the
labyrinth,

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.764
lost in the wilderness of the
Sierra Morena their lives

00:45:37.764 --> 00:45:41.108
twisted into the intricate maze
of the labyrinth on the brink of

00:45:41.108 --> 00:45:44.079
being devoured by the minotaur
of lust and madness,

00:45:44.079 --> 00:45:46.353
Cardenio, Luscinda,
Dorotea and Fernando are

00:45:46.353 --> 00:45:49.210
finally rescued by Don Quixote's
courageous battle,

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:53.239
and by the civilizing force of
an Erasmian church.

00:45:53.239 --> 00:45:55.371
Divine Providence,
in fact, has provided as

00:45:55.371 --> 00:45:57.150
Ariadne, the saving
threat."

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.956
That's the end of the quote,
which I hope now you can

00:45:59.956 --> 00:46:02.980
understand given the background
that I gave you about.

00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:06.619
All of this sounds fine,
and it is instructive,

00:46:06.619 --> 00:46:09.429
particularly the references to
Erasmus and to Vives,

00:46:09.429 --> 00:46:13.153
until we take into account the
hilarious convolutions and the

00:46:13.153 --> 00:46:16.188
mixture of madness,
dreams and lies that bring

00:46:16.188 --> 00:46:18.690
about the resolution of the
conflicts.

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:23.449
The conflicts have been solved
by Don Quixote's intervention,

00:46:23.449 --> 00:46:27.891
but how can such a ridiculous
figure be the instrument of

00:46:27.891 --> 00:46:30.510
Providence, with a capital P?
 

00:46:30.510 --> 00:46:34.628
They have been solved by Don
Quixote's agency because they

00:46:34.628 --> 00:46:39.101
are truly worldly conflicts,
involving tensions of a world

00:46:39.101 --> 00:46:42.681
in social flux,
where the older values,

00:46:42.681 --> 00:46:46.829
let's say the values of the
Renaissance,

00:46:46.829 --> 00:46:51.530
the values of courtly love,
no longer hold sway.

00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:55.068
Don Quixote embodies the
mixture of values in transition,

00:46:55.068 --> 00:46:58.291
so he can mediate in the
various conflicts and solve

00:46:58.291 --> 00:46:58.860
them.
 

00:46:58.860 --> 00:47:03.717
He would not have been able to
do so if he had been a real

00:47:03.717 --> 00:47:08.320
knight, nor had he been an
ordinary man of his time.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:13.512
But to say this is not to do
justice to the multilayer plots

00:47:13.512 --> 00:47:16.239
unraveling in these episodes.
 

00:47:16.239 --> 00:47:20.110
I am mostly struck by
Cervantes's inventiveness,

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:24.969
by the wild yet disciplined
imagination at play,

00:47:24.969 --> 00:47:29.936
which cannot,
I think, be reduced to this

00:47:29.936 --> 00:47:35.030
providential scheme that Javier
offers.

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:40.074
Don Fernando is at one level
Pandafilando de la Fosca Vista,

00:47:40.074 --> 00:47:40.929
a giant.
 

00:47:40.929 --> 00:47:44.800
Remember, the rhyme,
Fernando, Pandafilando.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:49.447
The figure of Pandafilando,
though invented ad hoc

00:47:49.447 --> 00:47:52.445
by the priest,
is presented as an effective

00:47:52.445 --> 00:47:54.768
factor in the outcome of the
conflicts,

00:47:54.768 --> 00:47:58.320
as are Tinacrio the Wise and
Princess Micomicona,

00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:03.369
although not real and
grotesque, not real in relation

00:48:03.369 --> 00:48:08.871
to the fiction of the novel,
this whole ensemble exists and

00:48:08.871 --> 00:48:13.523
performs on a level not unlike
that of the characters who

00:48:13.523 --> 00:48:16.936
invented them,
who invented this whole

00:48:16.936 --> 00:48:17.768
ensemble.
 

00:48:17.768 --> 00:48:21.599
The story of Pandafilando is
like a dream version,

00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:25.550
a recognizable distortion of
Dorotea's real conflict--

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:27.780
if you remember when we went
over it--

00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:31.489
the story of Pandafilando is
like a dream version,

00:48:31.489 --> 00:48:37.980
as I repeat,
of Dorotea's real conflict.

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:39.757
Remember, again,
the hidden meaning of

00:48:39.757 --> 00:48:41.802
Micomicona,
over which I will go again,

00:48:41.802 --> 00:48:44.139
in her name there is an
allusion to mimicry,

00:48:44.139 --> 00:48:47.213
to representation,
to mimesis, to the very process

00:48:47.213 --> 00:48:48.969
by which she was invented.
 

00:48:48.969 --> 00:48:55.250
Does Micomicona not in a way
represent representation itself?

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:58.036
I mean, she is the
representation itself talking

00:48:58.036 --> 00:48:59.460
place before our eyes.
 

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:03.512
Are all of these inventions of
characters by other characters

00:49:03.512 --> 00:49:07.766
similar to Cervantes's invention
of his own characters in the

00:49:07.766 --> 00:49:12.090
Quixote and this is what
this whole thing is telling us?

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:16.297
This is what is truly dazzling
about the resolution of all of

00:49:16.297 --> 00:49:19.454
these conflicts,
that they do unravel at every

00:49:19.454 --> 00:49:21.768
level sort of simultaneously.
 

00:49:21.768 --> 00:49:25.460
That is to say--and this is
what you have on the back of

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:29.322
your triangles,
and I have here on the

00:49:29.322 --> 00:49:33.945
board--all of these levels,
Don Quixote's dream,

00:49:33.945 --> 00:49:37.510
which is Don Quixote,
Pandafilando and Micomicona,

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.429
he cuts the head off of the
giant,

00:49:40.429 --> 00:49:42.389
he thinks, in the dream.
 

00:49:42.389 --> 00:49:46.351
The meta-fictional creation by
the priest, the story that the

00:49:46.351 --> 00:49:48.927
priest invents,
and that Micomicona then

00:49:48.927 --> 00:49:50.909
performs, meaning Dorotea.
 

00:49:50.909 --> 00:49:52.351
Don Quixote,
Pandafilando,

00:49:52.351 --> 00:49:55.318
Micomicona,
Tinacrio, all these characters

00:49:55.318 --> 00:49:58.989
in that novel that the priest
and Dorotea invent,

00:49:58.989 --> 00:50:01.190
and then, there is the fiction
of the novel,

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:03.579
which is Don Quixote,
Don Fernando,

00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:04.989
Dorotea, and so forth.
 

00:50:04.989 --> 00:50:10.335
All of those levels sort of
collapse together and the

00:50:10.335 --> 00:50:16.300
conflicts are resolved by Don
Quixote slaying the giant;

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:20.981
that is, cutting and bursting
poor Juan Palomeque's wine

00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:22.940
skins, to his horror.
 

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:26.797
It is a stroke of genius,
that the process of restitution

00:50:26.797 --> 00:50:30.585
will be motivated by Don
Quixote's nightmare which comes

00:50:30.585 --> 00:50:34.304
to interrupt the reading of
The Novel of the Curious

00:50:34.304 --> 00:50:36.695
Impertinent,
and the point,

00:50:36.695 --> 00:50:39.492
incidentally near the end,
which is when it's about to

00:50:39.492 --> 00:50:41.936
unravel,
when that novel is about to

00:50:41.936 --> 00:50:43.583
unravel,
another case of these

00:50:43.583 --> 00:50:44.230
interruptions.
 

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:47.552
In the dream,
Don Quixote completes the story

00:50:47.552 --> 00:50:51.474
of Princess Micomicona;
that is, Dorotea's predicament

00:50:51.474 --> 00:50:54.389
translated into the language of
chivalry,

00:50:54.389 --> 00:50:57.329
like Don Quixote's psychotic
delusion--

00:50:57.329 --> 00:51:03.980
Remember, about Queen Madasima
having had an affair with this

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:06.880
surgeon,
which was his version of

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.889
Luscinda being deflowered by Don
Fernando.

00:51:09.889 --> 00:51:14.775
Now, this version of Dorotea's
imbroglio true to the name she

00:51:14.775 --> 00:51:18.440
assumes is a grotesque parody of
her story.

00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.179
I go back to what I have just
said.

00:51:20.179 --> 00:51:21.911
Remember, that
"mico"

00:51:21.911 --> 00:51:24.940
means monkey,
Micomicona is "the twice

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:28.559
monkey" with an
augmentative like that--

00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:29.956
remember the augmentative in
"segund&amp;

00:51:29.956 --> 00:51:31.034
oacute;n"
that I mentioned

00:51:31.034 --> 00:51:32.958
"segundo,
segundón"

00:51:32.958 --> 00:51:34.527
from "second,"
"segund&amp;

00:51:34.527 --> 00:51:36.018
oacute;n"
is a big second.

00:51:36.018 --> 00:51:38.554
"Grande,
grandulón"

00:51:38.554 --> 00:51:40.210
in Spanish, lummox,
for a lummox,

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:41.090
and so forth.
 

00:51:41.090 --> 00:51:43.967
"Mico-micón,"
there's an augmentative

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:44.889
involved there.
 

00:51:44.889 --> 00:51:48.931
Micomicona--Remember,
monkey see monkey do and all of

00:51:48.931 --> 00:51:53.050
that?--She's a big blown up
distorted copy of Dorotea,

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:55.460
this is what Micomicona is.
 

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.545
The ending of Dorotea's story
in that register is what breaks

00:51:59.545 --> 00:52:02.949
off the reading--as I
mentioned--of The Novel of

00:52:02.949 --> 00:52:05.130
the Curious Impertinent.
 

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:08.789
That story will be resumed and
comes to its very tragic ending

00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:12.121
while those of Cardenio,
Luscinda, Dorotea and Don

00:52:12.121 --> 00:52:14.860
Fernando will have a purely
comic one,

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:17.306
happy endings,
as I mentioned,

00:52:17.306 --> 00:52:20.599
with marriages are typical of
comedy.

00:52:20.599 --> 00:52:23.985
This is yet another
intersection of the two stories

00:52:23.985 --> 00:52:27.034
here, with the accent on
section, on crossing,

00:52:27.034 --> 00:52:28.050
on cutting.
 

00:52:28.050 --> 00:52:31.612
The ending of The Novel of
the Curious Impertinent

00:52:31.612 --> 00:52:35.300
reveals its artificial literary
quality when the reading is

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.010
concluded and,
as I've mentioned,

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:44.820
the priest remarks,
as I said, that it doesn't

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:49.380
sound right for a husband to
have done,

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:55.869
so that it's not good mimesis,
and then there follow the court

00:52:55.869 --> 00:53:02.041
like scene of reconciliations
among the various couples and

00:53:02.041 --> 00:53:05.853
restitutions made,
including restitutions to the

00:53:05.853 --> 00:53:08.760
barber who's basin was--
you haven't gotten there but

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:12.528
you will see that there are a
series of restitutions to all of

00:53:12.528 --> 00:53:16.173
the characters who have been
injured or damaged or harmed in

00:53:16.173 --> 00:53:17.039
some way.
 

00:53:17.039 --> 00:53:24.384
The inn becomes like a court of
law where these restitutions are

00:53:24.384 --> 00:53:25.199
made.
 

00:53:25.199 --> 00:53:33.150
Now, I want to quote Javier
Herrero in a positive light now,

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:36.472
and he is right,
in the sense that the values

00:53:36.472 --> 00:53:41.380
are changing and there is sort
of an emerging bourgeois sense:

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:44.760
"It is true [he says]
that Neo-Platonism associated

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.202
with the tradition of courtly
love was still the accepted

00:53:48.202 --> 00:53:51.829
poetic and artistic vehicle for
aristocratic sentiment.

00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:54.980
But through the influence of
Christian humanism and as an

00:53:54.980 --> 00:53:57.849
expression of the strength of
the new bourgeois,

00:53:57.849 --> 00:54:01.326
the preoccupations with secular
life and above all marriage

00:54:01.326 --> 00:54:04.442
replaced the stylized
conventions of chivalry and the

00:54:04.442 --> 00:54:06.780
austere ideal of
monasticism."

00:54:06.780 --> 00:54:09.663
This may be true,
particularly if we take into

00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:13.443
account all of the economic and
legal background that I have

00:54:13.443 --> 00:54:17.480
given you about the relationship
between these characters,

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:22.228
the fact that Fernando is a
segundón and is

00:54:22.228 --> 00:54:25.789
not going to inherit much of the
state,

00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:31.192
which makes him very anxious,
the fact that Dorotea runs a

00:54:31.192 --> 00:54:34.699
farm and has money and all of
that;

00:54:34.699 --> 00:54:38.762
it does give the impression
that there is a kind of a

00:54:38.762 --> 00:54:43.608
bourgeois sense of marriage and
stability that is replacing the

00:54:43.608 --> 00:54:47.672
old idea of the Neo-Platonic
ideals contained in this

00:54:47.672 --> 00:54:52.440
aristocratic versions of love in
the poetic traditions.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:58.773
The idea also seems to be that
to cure the characters in the

00:54:58.773 --> 00:55:05.320
real world of the fiction where
they live they also have to be

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:09.829
cured in their dreams and
inventions,

00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:14.134
which is one of the overall
plot strands now being resolved

00:55:14.134 --> 00:55:17.760
in the Quixote,
he's the only one missing here.

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:22.635
I mean, everyone is going to be
sort of cured of his or her

00:55:22.635 --> 00:55:25.661
dreams, hallucinations,
and so forth,

00:55:25.661 --> 00:55:28.518
but Don Quixote still has not.
 

00:55:28.518 --> 00:55:32.762
But they have to be cured of
those hallucinations,

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:37.612
as well as their situation has
to be stabilized in social

00:55:37.612 --> 00:55:38.480
terms.
 

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:42.344
The priest, the barber and the
rest of the characters engage

00:55:42.344 --> 00:55:44.900
Don Quixote as his level of
madness,

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:48.739
in part because they are also
mad in their own ways,

00:55:48.739 --> 00:55:50.389
we have to realize this.
 

00:55:50.389 --> 00:55:54.757
What are the priest and the
barber doing traipsing all over

00:55:54.757 --> 00:55:56.639
Spain after the knight?
 

00:55:56.639 --> 00:55:59.059
Remember what I said before
about the priest,

00:55:59.059 --> 00:56:02.304
this is a very strange priest
who is a reader of romances of

00:56:02.304 --> 00:56:03.018
chivalry.
 

00:56:03.018 --> 00:56:09.728
What has become of the priest's
duties at church or the barber's

00:56:09.728 --> 00:56:11.860
customers, we ask?
 

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:15.485
They too have left normal
lives, as Sancho has,

00:56:15.485 --> 00:56:20.057
he left his wife and children,
to engage in an insane quest

00:56:20.057 --> 00:56:21.949
after an insane man.
 

00:56:21.949 --> 00:56:24.559
The point is that life,
mental life,

00:56:24.559 --> 00:56:27.659
is made up of levels that
mirror and distort each other,

00:56:27.659 --> 00:56:31.090
and that literature appears to
emerge from this interplay.

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:35.034
The creative mind of the author
is capable of reflecting or

00:56:35.034 --> 00:56:38.980
expressing the multilayered
essence of that mental life.

00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:43.666
After the captive's tale--about
which we'll be talking in the

00:56:43.666 --> 00:56:45.541
next class,
fascinating,

00:56:45.541 --> 00:56:49.193
very entertaining captive's
tail based on Cervantes's own

00:56:49.193 --> 00:56:51.481
life--
the priest and the barber and

00:56:51.481 --> 00:56:53.768
the others will send Don Quixote
home.

00:56:53.768 --> 00:56:59.217
They will cage him and send him
home in a return that will still

00:56:59.217 --> 00:57:02.329
engage them in further
adventures.

00:57:02.329 --> 00:57:08.746
The end of Part I is near,
and we will get to it next

00:57:08.746 --> 00:57:09.610
week.
 

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:15.000

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:04.800
Professor Amy
Hungerford: Before launching

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.727
into Pynchon today,
I thought I would just take a

00:00:07.727 --> 00:00:11.264
few moments to look back over
the books that we've read and

00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:14.679
talk about the visions of
language that they have offered

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.941
us,
and also just to reflect for a

00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:22.777
moment on the relationship
imagined between those visions

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:27.441
of language and what is
happening outside of fiction in

00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.810
what we might call the real
world.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.522
We started this course talking
about Black Boy and the

00:00:35.522 --> 00:00:40.000
way that a whole world of
pressure--political pressure,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.360
racial tension--pushed on the
borders of that work and

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.400
actually changed its very
material form.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.019
After that, I began a series of
readings of novels that

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:03.679
emphasized more what you might
call the history of literature,

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.120
the history of literature's
forms and ambitions.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.311
And so, beginning that series
we had O'Connor embodying a new

00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:20.090
critical craft of fiction that
comes out of modernism,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.729
imagining nevertheless that the
craft is reflective of a

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.420
transcendental order in the
world,

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.663
a religious order.
When we moved on to Nabokov,

00:01:36.663 --> 00:01:41.955
we had an author trying to
imagine a work of art so

00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:48.200
autonomous from the world that
it could be something like an

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.579
autonomous form of life.
That, of course,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:57.245
I argued in those lectures,
opened it up for the threat of

00:01:57.245 --> 00:02:00.502
mortality.
If you imagine your artwork is

00:02:00.502 --> 00:02:05.556
living, it can also die.
It's a kind of hauntedness that

00:02:05.556 --> 00:02:11.071
surrounds Nabokov's vision of
aesthetic bliss as one's

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:15.129
response to that autonomous
artwork.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.892
Kerouac represents a whole
group of writers,

00:02:19.892 --> 00:02:25.541
the Beats, who reject the
formalism embodied by both

00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:31.386
O'Connor and Nabokov.
They reject that formalism as

00:02:31.386 --> 00:02:36.265
an impediment to language's
access to the real,

00:02:36.265 --> 00:02:41.569
and to our access to the real
through language.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:47.219
They dream of an unmediated
relationship between experience

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:51.280
and the word.
They don't think so much of

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.479
language as a mediating force as
an expressive force.

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:03.244
I argued in my second lecture
on On the Road that,

00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:10.250
in the end, that dream looks
quite deflated when Dean can't

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.840
even speak in a coherent
sentence,

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.809
and he has to be rejected by
Sal as Sal drives off to the

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:25.696
jazz concert at Carnegie Hall.
Nevertheless,

00:03:25.696 --> 00:03:31.899
that dream is spiritualized.
It's a way of becoming not just

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:36.405
close to the real,
but also part of some mystical

00:03:36.405 --> 00:03:39.779
unity.
That thread of the mystical

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:44.839
quality of language at its
extreme of literary power is

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:50.180
what I drew out of Franny and
Zooey. So,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.823
Salinger, too,
has the dream that the artifice

00:03:53.823 --> 00:03:56.900
of literature,
of literary language,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.690
the performance of language in
the style of his novels,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:09.599
can somehow be the essence of
the human soul,

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:16.591
that it can somehow communicate
the truth of the universe just

00:04:16.591 --> 00:04:20.030
through its form:
its human,

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.663
distinctive form.
It's a way of thinking about

00:04:23.663 --> 00:04:27.828
form that has more to do with
individuality than it does with

00:04:27.828 --> 00:04:31.589
convention.
Remember that way that Franny

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:36.397
can identify the timbre of her
brother's voice very

00:04:36.397 --> 00:04:39.860
specifically:
it's like no other.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:46.353
So, Salinger imagines that the
literary art imitates that kind

00:04:46.353 --> 00:04:51.570
of voice, and in that way it is
a sacred practice,

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.477
a sacred art.
Barth rejects the idea that

00:04:56.477 --> 00:05:01.674
language is an unmediated form
of access to the real:

00:05:01.674 --> 00:05:07.670
absolutely impossible for Barth
to countenance that idea.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:13.327
He sees life as continually,
always already mediated by

00:05:13.327 --> 00:05:15.479
language.
Now, I should say,

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.812
as someone from the class who
came up to me after lecture and

00:05:18.812 --> 00:05:22.500
asked me about this,
that Barth's understanding of

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.907
language as preceding human
understanding,

00:05:25.907 --> 00:05:28.899
preceding any sense of
ourselves,

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:32.395
in a sense always slipping out
of our control,

00:05:32.395 --> 00:05:36.512
is very much in concert with
what was going on at very

00:05:36.512 --> 00:05:39.930
high-level language theory at
that time.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.414
So, the work of Jacques Lacan
in France in the 1950s and '60s

00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:48.524
and of Jacques Derrida who
brought deconstruction to the

00:05:48.524 --> 00:05:52.313
United States,
actually to Johns Hopkins first

00:05:52.313 --> 00:05:55.940
of all in the 1960s where Barth
was teaching.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.499
He presented that work in a
very famous lecture in the late

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:04.456
'60s.
This is all part of a way of

00:06:04.456 --> 00:06:09.356
thinking about language that
became very powerful through the

00:06:09.356 --> 00:06:13.668
next decade and a half,
and we're going to see it some

00:06:13.668 --> 00:06:17.314
too next week when we read
Morrison and Maxine Hong

00:06:17.314 --> 00:06:19.938
Kingston.
So, this is part of a larger

00:06:19.938 --> 00:06:23.706
intellectual trajectory.
Barth is not alone in thinking

00:06:23.706 --> 00:06:28.477
these things about language.
I argued that Barth tried

00:06:28.477 --> 00:06:33.206
to counter that sense of
helplessness at the hands of

00:06:33.206 --> 00:06:38.754
language by imagining that the
human effort at connecting with

00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:43.756
another person through the
mechanisms of love and desire

00:06:43.756 --> 00:06:49.304
always renewed the possibility
for language to do new kinds of

00:06:49.304 --> 00:06:53.805
work in the world.
So, if language seems exhausted

00:06:53.805 --> 00:06:57.434
because it's always preceding
you, everything has always

00:06:57.434 --> 00:07:01.268
already been said,
there's no new plot to be had,

00:07:01.268 --> 00:07:05.921
the world is full of stock
phrases, how do you use them to

00:07:05.921 --> 00:07:09.839
embody an experience that seems
fresh to you?

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:13.270
How do those stock phrases
alienate you from the very

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.240
experience you hope that they
can describe?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.613
He thinks that following out
desire can renew language,

00:07:21.613 --> 00:07:27.584
and Menelaiad, I
think, is his attempt at doing

00:07:27.584 --> 00:07:30.912
that.
So, now we arrive at that

00:07:30.912 --> 00:07:36.946
tension, and I want to suggest
that Barth was still dreaming of

00:07:36.946 --> 00:07:41.910
a pretty autonomous version of
the literary art,

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.959
even though in his 1987 preface
to Lost in the

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:50.685
Funhouse--I don't know if
any of you read it--he says

00:07:50.685 --> 00:07:54.629
about these stories,
which were published throughout

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:56.630
the '60s:
The high '60s,

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.998
like the roaring '20s,
was a time of more than usual

00:07:59.998 --> 00:08:03.959
ferment in American social,
political, and artistic life.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:07.550
Our unpopular war in Vietnam,
political assassinations,

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.209
race riots, the hippie
counterculture,

00:08:10.209 --> 00:08:12.927
pop art, mass poetry reading,
street theater,

00:08:12.927 --> 00:08:16.385
vigorous avant-gardism in all
the arts together with dire

00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:19.843
predictions not only of the
death of the novel but of the

00:08:19.843 --> 00:08:23.240
moribundity of the print medium
in the electronic global

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.759
village: those flavored the air
we breathed then,

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:30.279
along with occasional tear gas
and other contaminants.

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:35.129
One may sniff traces of that
air in the Funhouse.

00:08:35.129 --> 00:08:38.159
I myself found it more
invigorating than disturbing.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:41.820
May the reader find these
stories likewise.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.539
It's a very interesting little
comparison he makes at the end.

00:08:46.539 --> 00:08:50.505
He takes that whole foment of
1960s politics and

00:08:50.505 --> 00:08:54.049
counterculture,
and essentially he says,

00:08:54.049 --> 00:08:59.034
"I found that invigorating as I
hope you will find these stories

00:08:59.034 --> 00:09:02.291
invigorating,"
as if the stories in this

00:09:02.291 --> 00:09:05.795
very--almost,
seemingly, hermetically--sealed

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:10.654
literary world that he offers us
are somehow meant to have the

00:09:10.654 --> 00:09:13.920
effects of a whole decade of
foment,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.308
social foment.
If Barth only gestures

00:09:20.308 --> 00:09:25.766
towards that world,
the politics of that decade,

00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:29.830
Pynchon actually lets us see
it.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:35.389
And if you look on page 83,
this is just one of many,

00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:38.292
many examples.
But I choose this one just

00:09:38.292 --> 00:09:39.440
because it's so obvious.

00:09:44.549 --> 00:09:49.990
Oedipa is going to Berkeley
looking for Emory Bortz,

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:56.070
and she comes on a summer
weekday in the mid afternoon.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:10:00.367
No time for any campus
Oedipa knew of to be jumping,

00:10:00.367 --> 00:10:03.384
yet this one was.
She came down the slope from

00:10:03.384 --> 00:10:06.610
Wheeler Hall through Sather Gate
into a plaza teeming with

00:10:06.610 --> 00:10:08.537
corduroy,
denim, bare legs,

00:10:08.537 --> 00:10:12.059
blond hair, horn rims,
bicycle spokes in the sun,

00:10:12.059 --> 00:10:14.688
book bags swaying,
card tables,

00:10:14.688 --> 00:10:19.223
long paper petitions dangling
to earth, posters for

00:10:19.223 --> 00:10:23.435
undecipherable FSMs,
YAFs, VDCs, suds in the

00:10:23.435 --> 00:10:27.409
fountain, students nose to nose
in dialog.

00:10:27.409 --> 00:10:30.083
She moved through it carrying
her fat book,

00:10:30.083 --> 00:10:32.948
attracted, unsure,
a stranger, wanting to feel

00:10:32.948 --> 00:10:36.640
relevant but knowing how much of
a search among alternative

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.587
universes it would take for she
had undergone her own educating

00:10:40.587 --> 00:10:44.717
at a time of nerves,
blandness and retreat not only

00:10:44.717 --> 00:10:48.863
among her fellow students but
also most of the visible

00:10:48.863 --> 00:10:53.088
structure around and ahead of
them [that whole world of

00:10:53.088 --> 00:10:56.139
government and social
life].

00:10:56.139 --> 00:10:59.223
Oedipa is in a different
generation, of a different

00:10:59.223 --> 00:11:02.677
generation, but we can see the
social foment just in that

00:11:02.677 --> 00:11:05.330
little snapshot of the Berkeley
campus.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.360
I don't know all of the
acronyms.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.991
I don't know what the FSMs are,
but the YAFs are the Young

00:11:10.991 --> 00:11:15.270
Americans for Freedom.
The VDCs are the Vietnam Day

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:19.470
Committees.
The Vietnam Day Committee

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:26.960
organized a 24-hour teach-in in
1965 against the Vietnam War.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.354
There is a little anecdote from
that teach-in that I want to

00:11:31.354 --> 00:11:34.631
share with you,
that I think embodies some of

00:11:34.631 --> 00:11:40.208
the tensions in this novel.
They invited Ken Kesey to come

00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:45.220
and speak at the convention,
at the teach-in.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.129
Now, Ken Kesey,
some of you probably know,

00:11:49.129 --> 00:11:54.659
was a sort of performer,
writer, not really an activist.

00:11:54.659 --> 00:11:59.023
He was a purveyor of street
theater and most famously the

00:11:59.023 --> 00:12:02.684
advocate of LSD,
and he and his Merry Pranksters

00:12:02.684 --> 00:12:06.970
would ride around the country
doing street theater,

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:10.590
advocating the use of LSD and
marijuana.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.937
Who, in 1964,
do you think drove their bus,

00:12:13.937 --> 00:12:18.262
which was called Further?
Who do you think drove their

00:12:18.262 --> 00:12:21.360
bus?
Neal Cassady drove their bus.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:26.779
When they came to the Vietnam
Day at the Berkeley campus,

00:12:26.779 --> 00:12:30.940
Kesey addressed the assembled
people saying,

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.777
"Turn your back on the war.
Look at the war,

00:12:35.777 --> 00:12:41.059
turn your back on the war and
say 'fuck it.'"

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:45.382
This is a group of people he
was addressing who were intent

00:12:45.382 --> 00:12:49.481
on doing something to stop the
war, and this was Kesey's

00:12:49.481 --> 00:12:51.764
response.
That moment,

00:12:51.764 --> 00:12:56.280
for me, embodies this tension
right at the center of the

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.402
1960s,
a tension between

00:12:59.402 --> 00:13:06.828
countercultural self-development
and an ethos of play,

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:08.650
"drop out,

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:16.539
tune in," and (I can't remember
Kesey's little motto).

00:13:16.539 --> 00:13:20.723
Essentially,
leave the institutional life of

00:13:20.723 --> 00:13:24.809
America--that means schools,
government,

00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:30.836
politics, all those traditional
sources of order--and create

00:13:30.836 --> 00:13:34.214
disorder.
And do that as a way of finding

00:13:34.214 --> 00:13:38.350
what's true about yourself;
do it in the company of others.

00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:41.350
It had this communal aspect,
for sure.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:45.142
On the other side,
you have a growing political

00:13:45.142 --> 00:13:50.090
movement among young people,
and of course it's legendary.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:54.634
By 1964, the Civil Rights
movement had accomplished

00:13:54.634 --> 00:13:58.001
amazing things.
As a result of the Freedom

00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:01.645
Rides, they had integrated
interstate transportation,

00:14:01.645 --> 00:14:05.570
at great cost to the volunteers
who rode those buses.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.769
They were beaten.
Some were killed.

00:14:08.769 --> 00:14:12.960
Civil Rights workers were
murdered in various states.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:17.632
It had come to a kind of
crescendo with voter

00:14:17.632 --> 00:14:23.580
registration drives and the
Voting Rights Act of 1964.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.159
At the same time,
Lyndon B.

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:31.716
Johnson was ratcheting up the
Vietnam War, so the Gulf of

00:14:31.716 --> 00:14:37.768
Tonkin Resolution was passed in
1964, which authorized bombing

00:14:37.768 --> 00:14:42.682
raids on Cambodia.
This was a new turn in the war,

00:14:42.682 --> 00:14:46.441
and it promised to escalate it,
and this really

00:14:46.441 --> 00:14:50.200
galvanized--especially
student--resistance.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.358
So, this was a time of major
political stakes,

00:14:53.358 --> 00:14:56.516
and young people at
universities--primarily at

00:14:56.516 --> 00:15:00.733
universities,
but also people out doing the

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:04.173
March on Washington,
in the South,

00:15:04.173 --> 00:15:10.325
in small towns--were really
changing the face of America and

00:15:10.325 --> 00:15:14.880
its role in the world.
So, Ken Kesey,

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:19.329
on the one hand,
is looking for that internally

00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:24.746
directed, playful response to
the oppressive order of the

00:15:24.746 --> 00:15:27.234
world.
And then there is this very

00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:31.120
political response.
Pynchon lets us see both.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:36.294
And he's parodying both kinds
of response in this novel,

00:15:36.294 --> 00:15:40.623
so in that sense,
the novel is very much of its

00:15:40.623 --> 00:15:44.103
time.
Now, I want to pause for a

00:15:44.103 --> 00:15:47.850
moment there and ask you a
question.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:52.946
I want you to think about what
kind of protagonist Pynchon

00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:57.135
sends out into this world.
What do you think of Oedipa

00:15:57.135 --> 00:15:59.340
Maas?
How does she strike you as a

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:04.389
character?
How would you describe her?

00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.975
Yeah.
Student:

00:16:04.975 --> 00:16:06.293
Desperate.Professor
Amy Hungerford:

00:16:06.293 --> 00:16:07.980
Desperate.
Okay.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.110
How else?
Yeah.Student:

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.598
Powerless.Professor
Amy Hungerford:

00:16:10.598 --> 00:16:12.302
Powerless.
Uh huh.Student:

00:16:12.302 --> 00:16:14.225
Very
confused.Professor Amy

00:16:14.225 --> 00:16:19.110
Hungerford: Confused.
What else?

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.770
Those are all pretty negative
adjectives.

00:16:22.770 --> 00:16:26.450
Does she bring any resources?
Yes.Student:

00:16:26.450 --> 00:16:27.980
She's especially
attractive.Professor Amy

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:29.060
Hungerford: She's
attractive.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.889
Yes, she is.
What else?

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:35.940
What other resources does she
bring?

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.819
Yeah.Student:
She's

00:16:36.819 --> 00:16:38.670
curious.Professor Amy
Hungerford: She's curious.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.320
Yeah.
What else?

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:41.691
Anything else?
Student:

00:16:41.691 --> 00:16:42.576
She's
determined.Professor Amy

00:16:42.576 --> 00:16:46.129
Hungerford: Determined.
Uh huh.

00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:52.637
When this book first came out,
critics called her a

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:57.418
lightweight.
Was that a word that ever

00:16:57.418 --> 00:17:01.126
occurred to you?
Did anyone think,

00:17:01.126 --> 00:17:04.519
"this is just a fluff
character"?

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:09.056
I would suggest to you that the
difference in your response and

00:17:09.056 --> 00:17:13.740
the critics' is the difference
that feminism in the '70s made.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:18.681
In the 1960s,
to have a protagonist go into

00:17:18.681 --> 00:17:24.800
the world and discover this
incredibly complex set of

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.511
patterns,
and to have that protagonist be

00:17:28.511 --> 00:17:31.960
a housewife, was very much
playing against type.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.933
So, Pynchon took a certain kind
of risk by choosing to make his

00:17:35.933 --> 00:17:39.740
protagonist a housewife.
So, the question is,

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:45.476
why did he do that?
I want to suggest to you that

00:17:45.476 --> 00:17:52.421
he did that because a woman is
expected to occupy certain

00:17:52.421 --> 00:17:57.009
conventional roles at this
moment,

00:17:57.009 --> 00:17:59.200
and we see her in one at the
very beginning of the novel.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:04.498
She has just come back from a
Tupperware party where the

00:18:04.498 --> 00:18:10.086
hostess put too much kirsch in
the punch, so she's a little

00:18:10.086 --> 00:18:12.817
drunk.
So you get this image of her as

00:18:12.817 --> 00:18:15.782
this stereotypical '50s
housewife going to Tupperware

00:18:15.782 --> 00:18:17.962
parties.
And then she makes salad,

00:18:17.962 --> 00:18:20.819
she does the shopping,
she picks herbs from the

00:18:20.819 --> 00:18:22.786
garden,
she makes lasagna,

00:18:22.786 --> 00:18:26.602
she mixes drinks so that
they'll be ready when Mucho

00:18:26.602 --> 00:18:29.476
comes home,
when her husband comes home:

00:18:29.476 --> 00:18:32.695
very typical.
So, this is the moment in

00:18:32.695 --> 00:18:36.828
which she discovers that she's
been chosen, or named,

00:18:36.828 --> 00:18:39.769
as the executrix of Pierce's
will.

00:18:39.769 --> 00:18:45.124
It's that conventionality that
then allows her to occupy

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:49.561
multiple roles.
And let me just detail some of

00:18:49.561 --> 00:18:55.206
those.
You see it almost in language

00:18:55.206 --> 00:19:00.237
of aside.
This is when she first meets

00:19:00.237 --> 00:19:02.470
Genghis Cohen.
Yes.

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:06.869
Now the names in here,
we have to think about them at

00:19:06.869 --> 00:19:10.708
some point.
One thing you can say about

00:19:10.708 --> 00:19:16.219
them is that they are funny.
A second thing you can say

00:19:16.219 --> 00:19:21.160
about them is that they seem
redolent of meaning.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.500
I can't tell you how many
scholars have come up with

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.750
different readings of what
Oedipa's name means.

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:28.565
That's just Oedipa,
and then there are so many

00:19:28.565 --> 00:19:31.079
hundreds of others.
They are redolent of meaning.

00:19:31.079 --> 00:19:33.330
What are we to do with that
fact?

00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:36.702
It's a question for you.
Three: they declare that

00:19:36.702 --> 00:19:41.077
language is always mediated,
always mediating,

00:19:41.077 --> 00:19:46.812
that your experience of people
is never clear of some set of

00:19:46.812 --> 00:19:51.769
meanings that someone else has
assigned to it.

00:19:51.769 --> 00:19:56.029
Your encounter with the world
is always mediated.

00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:58.783
So, these names drag
associations with them,

00:19:58.783 --> 00:20:02.240
and one question I want to ask
is: what to do with those?

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.814
But I'm going to set that
question aside for a moment,

00:20:05.814 --> 00:20:08.039
and note that,
at meeting Genghis,

00:20:08.039 --> 00:20:10.400
"Oedipa felt at once motherly."

00:20:14.009 --> 00:20:21.896
Now, this may seem like a small
aside, but if we look also on

00:20:21.896 --> 00:20:28.468
73, when she meets Mr.
Thoth, she says (on the very

00:20:28.468 --> 00:20:32.166
top;
he's telling Oedipa his dream,

00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:37.369
and she sees in it clues to the
Thurn and Taxis mystery):

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:40.407
Oedipa,
sensitized, thinking of the

00:20:40.407 --> 00:20:42.686
bronze marker,
smiled at him as

00:20:42.686 --> 00:20:46.180
granddaughterly as she knew how
and asked,

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.150
"Did he ever have to fight off
desperados?"

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:51.303
And then, of course,
she gets a major clue for

00:20:51.303 --> 00:20:55.438
figuring out what the whole
story is behind the Tristero and

00:20:55.438 --> 00:20:58.950
the post horn.
"Granddaughterly."

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:04.490
It's a role she occupies with
great ease.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.460
A last example, on 122.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:20.420
This is when she's going to
meet Emory Bortz:

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.273
Oedipa showered,
put on a sweater,

00:21:23.273 --> 00:21:26.199
skirt and sneakers,
wrapped her hair in a

00:21:26.199 --> 00:21:30.150
student-like twist,
went easy on the makeup.

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:37.698
These are her resources:
makeup, clothes,

00:21:37.698 --> 00:21:41.051
hair.
With them she can occupy all

00:21:41.051 --> 00:21:44.825
these different roles,
and in doing so she has access

00:21:44.825 --> 00:21:50.469
to certain kinds of knowledge.
Her roles are as fluid,

00:21:50.469 --> 00:21:54.990
in some ways,
as Pierce's were.

00:21:58.009 --> 00:22:00.587
Remember that when Pierce calls
her, he's always impersonating

00:22:00.587 --> 00:22:02.854
someone.
So, he was speaking with his

00:22:02.854 --> 00:22:06.740
Lamont Cranston voice the last
time that she spoke to him.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.869
The difference between the way
Oedipa occupies these various

00:22:10.869 --> 00:22:15.681
roles, and Pierce did it,
is that Oedipa's roles have a

00:22:15.681 --> 00:22:21.725
kind of traction in the world
with other people that Pierce's

00:22:21.725 --> 00:22:26.762
voices--or even Dr.
Hilarius's voices--simply don't

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:30.869
have.
These male versions of it are

00:22:30.869 --> 00:22:37.389
all so apparently performances
that they can't get much out of

00:22:37.389 --> 00:22:43.502
them, except to annoy Oedipa.
But Oedipa jumps right into

00:22:43.502 --> 00:22:48.886
these conventional roles,
and in that act comes to know

00:22:48.886 --> 00:22:54.369
more about the world in a way
that these men cannot.

00:22:54.369 --> 00:23:01.016
Oedipa is--even from the
time she was a child--a reader,

00:23:01.016 --> 00:23:07.438
and we find that out on page 14
when she has her religious

00:23:07.438 --> 00:23:11.337
instant.
And I hope you remembered that

00:23:11.337 --> 00:23:14.990
scene of Sal looking down on
Salt Lake City,

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.642
the birthplace of Dean,
from On the Road,

00:23:18.642 --> 00:23:22.367
very similar structure.
He looks down,

00:23:22.367 --> 00:23:25.819
and he sees the little city
laid out below him.

00:23:25.819 --> 00:23:29.873
So, this is Oedipa in one of
the first instances of her

00:23:29.873 --> 00:23:31.450
becoming a reader:

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.447
She looked down a slope,
needing to squint for the

00:23:39.447 --> 00:23:43.019
sunlight [this is when she first
sees San Narciso],

00:23:43.019 --> 00:23:45.761
onto a vast sprawl of houses
which had grown up all together

00:23:45.761 --> 00:23:47.619
like a well-tended crop from the
dull,

00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:50.262
brown earth,
and she thought of the time

00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:54.327
she'd opened a transistor radio
to replace a battery and seen

00:23:54.327 --> 00:23:58.459
her first printed circuit.
The ordered swirl of houses and

00:23:58.459 --> 00:24:02.454
streets from this high angle
sprang at her now with the same

00:24:02.454 --> 00:24:06.450
unexpected, astonishing clarity
as the circuit card had.

00:24:06.450 --> 00:24:09.847
Though she knew even less about
radios than about southern

00:24:09.847 --> 00:24:12.171
Californians,
there were to both outward

00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:15.450
patterns a hieroglyphic sense of
concealed meaning,

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:19.313
of an intent to communicate.
There had seemed no limit to

00:24:19.313 --> 00:24:22.534
what the printed circuit could
have told her if she had tried

00:24:22.534 --> 00:24:25.780
to find out.
So, in her first minute of San

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:30.497
Narciso, a revelation also
trembled just past the threshold

00:24:30.497 --> 00:24:34.057
of her understanding.
Smog hung all around the

00:24:34.057 --> 00:24:36.013
horizon.
The sun on the bright,

00:24:36.013 --> 00:24:40.069
beige countryside was painful.
She and the Chevy seemed parked

00:24:40.069 --> 00:24:42.912
at the center of an odd
religious instant,

00:24:42.912 --> 00:24:46.901
as if on some other frequency,
or out of the eye of some

00:24:46.901 --> 00:24:51.189
whirlwind rotating too slow for
her heated skin even to feel the

00:24:51.189 --> 00:24:54.660
centrifugal coolness of words
were being spoken.

00:24:54.660 --> 00:24:57.846
She suspected that much.
She thought of Mucho,

00:24:57.846 --> 00:25:00.480
her husband,
trying to believe in his job.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.413
Was it something like this he
felt looking through the

00:25:03.413 --> 00:25:06.457
soundproof glass at one of his
colleagues with a headset

00:25:06.457 --> 00:25:09.778
clamped on and cueing the next
record with movements stylized

00:25:09.778 --> 00:25:13.612
as the handling of chrism,
censer, chalice might be for a

00:25:13.612 --> 00:25:17.119
holy man yet really tuned in to
the voice, voices,

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:19.337
the music, its message,
surrounded by it,

00:25:19.337 --> 00:25:22.329
digging it, as were all the
faithful it went out to?

00:25:22.329 --> 00:25:26.302
Did Mucho stand outside Studio
A looking in knowing that even

00:25:26.302 --> 00:25:29.480
if he could hear it he couldn't
believe in it?

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.008
She gave up presently as if a
cloud had approached the sun or

00:25:34.008 --> 00:25:38.309
the smog thickened and so broken
the religious instant,

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:42.369
whatever it might have
been.

00:25:42.369 --> 00:25:48.156
Here, the cloud becomes the
obscuring of this sense of

00:25:48.156 --> 00:25:54.269
intent to communicate or a sense
of meaning's pattern.

00:25:54.269 --> 00:26:00.631
But it still retains--as it did
in Flannery O'Connor--that

00:26:00.631 --> 00:26:07.215
spiritual sense that the divine
is always shrouded around by

00:26:07.215 --> 00:26:13.948
some Cloud of Unknowing.
But here we see her with the

00:26:13.948 --> 00:26:17.532
desire to know.
And the difference between her

00:26:17.532 --> 00:26:20.171
as a child and her in this
moment is that she had not

00:26:20.171 --> 00:26:22.690
bothered to find out.
If she had tried to find out

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:24.826
about the radio circuit,
she would have learned

00:26:24.826 --> 00:26:27.140
something.
She did not try.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:31.325
This time she will try.
So, she's a reader who notices

00:26:31.325 --> 00:26:35.239
patterns even from a young age.
And at this moment she is

00:26:35.239 --> 00:26:40.140
called upon--and she rises to
the occasion--to figure out what

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:43.634
the pattern will mean.
And, of course,

00:26:43.634 --> 00:26:48.009
she progresses through a kind
of education as a reader.

00:26:48.009 --> 00:26:50.912
She goes from being a reader
who can listen,

00:26:50.912 --> 00:26:53.410
for example,
to the ambiguities in the

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:56.559
Wharfinger play.
She can hear when the ambiguity

00:26:56.559 --> 00:26:59.750
creeps in between the words,
and that tells her that she

00:26:59.750 --> 00:27:04.702
needs to find something out.
That's what causes her to have

00:27:04.702 --> 00:27:10.000
the curiosity to go backstage.
She becomes a critic.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.082
She moves from interpretation
to actually finding the history,

00:27:16.082 --> 00:27:21.167
and the intertextuality,
and the variations of these

00:27:21.167 --> 00:27:26.519
editions of the play.
She learns history, of the U.S.

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:30.079
and of Europe,
about the mail systems.

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:34.779
She learns the history of
Inverarity's enterprises.

00:27:34.779 --> 00:27:39.890
So, she becomes a scholar in a
certain way, an amateur scholar.

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:43.829
She's not just a reader;
she's someone who actually

00:27:43.829 --> 00:27:48.131
performs research.
Where does all of this get

00:27:48.131 --> 00:27:49.911
her?
Well, I think,

00:27:49.911 --> 00:27:54.481
what we're led to believe,
is precisely nowhere,

00:27:54.481 --> 00:28:00.069
in terms of revelation.
Does a revelation ever happen?

00:28:00.069 --> 00:28:04.860
Of course, the book ends with
her waiting for the anonymous

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.892
bidder to reveal himself.
Whether that would ever happen,

00:28:09.892 --> 00:28:14.323
if Pynchon had decided to let
us in on the secret,

00:28:14.323 --> 00:28:17.141
I don't know.
Pynchon, instead,

00:28:17.141 --> 00:28:22.061
chooses to end the novel before
that moment, and so we're left

00:28:22.061 --> 00:28:28.836
with a kind of emptiness.
We're left with the multiple

00:28:28.836 --> 00:28:38.008
options that she laments.
If you look on 146-147,

00:28:38.008 --> 00:28:47.965
she rehearses all the
possibilities of meaning,

00:28:47.965 --> 00:28:56.839
and her conclusion,
finally, is this:

00:28:56.839 --> 00:29:00.921
San Narciso was a name,
an incident among our climatic

00:29:00.921 --> 00:29:04.310
records of dreams and what
dreams became among our

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:07.698
accumulated daylight,
a moment's squall line or

00:29:07.698 --> 00:29:11.214
tornado's touchdown among the
higher, more continental

00:29:11.214 --> 00:29:14.232
solemnities,
storm systems of group

00:29:14.232 --> 00:29:18.920
suffering and need,
prevailing winds of affluence.

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:23.480
There was the true continuity.
San Narciso had no boundaries.

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.750
No one knew yet how to draw
them.

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:30.581
She had dedicated herself weeks
ago to making sense of what

00:29:30.581 --> 00:29:34.914
Inverarity had left behind,
never suspecting that the

00:29:34.914 --> 00:29:39.547
legacy was America.
And then, I'm going to skip

00:29:39.547 --> 00:29:42.593
down a little bit:
Though she never again

00:29:42.593 --> 00:29:45.150
called back any image of the
dead man to dress up,

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:49.195
pose, talk to and make answer,
neither would she lose a new

00:29:49.195 --> 00:29:53.660
compassion for the cul-de-sac
he'd tried to find a way out of,

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:58.019
for the enigma his efforts had
created.

00:29:58.019 --> 00:30:02.842
What we don't get here is a
sense of whether there really is

00:30:02.842 --> 00:30:07.257
an alternate secret postal
system that serves a sort of

00:30:07.257 --> 00:30:11.927
underground of private networks.
We don't ever get a sense of

00:30:11.927 --> 00:30:15.506
whether these stamps and the
signs that she sees everywhere

00:30:15.506 --> 00:30:18.961
in San Francisco when she
travels through the city in the

00:30:18.961 --> 00:30:23.132
night,
whether these things are a

00:30:23.132 --> 00:30:28.505
coherent meaning,
or whether they are her

00:30:28.505 --> 00:30:33.454
fabrication.
We don't really know and she

00:30:33.454 --> 00:30:38.219
never really can say.
All she has is the sense that

00:30:38.219 --> 00:30:42.523
there is this pattern.
Now, there are two things

00:30:42.523 --> 00:30:46.501
that she is left with,
in the passage I just read:

00:30:46.501 --> 00:30:50.559
that sense of San Narciso being
all of America,

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:55.350
and, moreover,
of it being constituted of

00:30:55.350 --> 00:31:00.859
"storm systems of group
suffering and need."

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:05.660
So, remember all of the little
subcommunities that she

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:11.093
interacts with have some sort of
pain or loss associated with

00:31:11.093 --> 00:31:15.260
them: the Inamorati Anonymous
for example,

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:20.225
people who don't want to love.
It's all comedy,

00:31:20.225 --> 00:31:23.589
but then there is a heart,
a kernel.

00:31:23.589 --> 00:31:29.380
And if we look on page 101-102,
we can begin to see what that

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:34.399
heart or kernel is that
recuperates what I would call

00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:36.330
the sentimental.

00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:48.168
So, this is when she's in San
Francisco, looking around the

00:31:48.168 --> 00:31:51.126
city.
She's come there hoping to

00:31:51.126 --> 00:31:56.249
escape the network of symbols
that she has seen--all those

00:31:56.249 --> 00:32:01.551
post horns--and instead she's
immersed with a new network of

00:32:01.551 --> 00:32:02.980
them.
We're told: 

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:06.296
Just before the morning
rush hour she got out of a

00:32:06.296 --> 00:32:09.431
jitney whose ancient driver
ended each day in the red

00:32:09.431 --> 00:32:13.036
downtown on Howard Street,
began to walk toward the

00:32:13.036 --> 00:32:15.465
Embarcadero.
She knew she looked terrible,

00:32:15.465 --> 00:32:18.377
knuckles black with eyeliner
and mascara from where she had

00:32:18.377 --> 00:32:20.818
rubbed,
mouth tasting of old booze and

00:32:20.818 --> 00:32:24.750
coffee, through an open doorway.
On the stair leading up into

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:28.157
the disinfectant-smelling
twilight of a rooming house,

00:32:28.157 --> 00:32:31.887
she saw an old man huddled,
shaking with grief she couldn't

00:32:31.887 --> 00:32:33.935
hear.
Both hands, smoke white,

00:32:33.935 --> 00:32:36.675
covered his face.
On the back of the left hand

00:32:36.675 --> 00:32:39.624
she made out the post horn
tattooed in old ink now

00:32:39.624 --> 00:32:43.331
beginning to blur and spread.
Fascinated, she came into the

00:32:43.331 --> 00:32:47.079
shadows and ascended creaking
steps, hesitating on each one.

00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:50.890
When she was three steps from
him the hands flew apart and his

00:32:50.890 --> 00:32:54.450
wrecked face and the terror of
eyes gloried in burst veins

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.350
stopped her.
"Can I help?"

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.970
She was shaking, tired.
"My wife's in Fresno," he said.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.298
He wore an old double-breasted
suit, frayed gray shirt,

00:33:03.298 --> 00:33:06.254
wide tie, no hat.
"I left her so long ago I don't

00:33:06.254 --> 00:33:08.220
remember.
This is for her."

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:11.045
He gave Oedipa a letter that
looked like he'd been carrying

00:33:11.045 --> 00:33:16.365
it around for years.
And he tells her to drop it in

00:33:16.365 --> 00:33:20.190
the "W.A.S.T.E.,
lady," can.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:21.827
W.A.S.T.E.
We're not allowed to say

00:33:21.827 --> 00:33:25.069
"waste," remember.
And then she is gripped

00:33:25.069 --> 00:33:29.628
with--as she says,
"overcome all at once"--by a

00:33:29.628 --> 00:33:33.869
need to touch him,
as if she could not believe in

00:33:33.869 --> 00:33:37.527
him or would not remember him.
And she reflects,

00:33:37.527 --> 00:33:41.223
just above that,
on the mattress that he must

00:33:41.223 --> 00:33:46.430
sleep in, and this is one of
those great Pynchon sentences.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:50.744
This is a question,
but it comes in the declarative

00:33:50.744 --> 00:33:53.686
form, too.
 What voices overheard,

00:33:53.686 --> 00:33:57.500
flinders of luminescent gods
glimpsed among the wallpaper's

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.561
stained foliage,
candle stubs lit to rotate in

00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:04.373
the air over him prefiguring the
cigarette he or a friend must

00:34:04.373 --> 00:34:08.200
fall asleep someday smoking,
thus to end among the flaming,

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.918
secret salts held all those
years by the insatiable stuffing

00:34:11.918 --> 00:34:15.446
of a mattress that could keep
vestiges of every nightmare

00:34:15.446 --> 00:34:18.411
sweat,
helpless overflowing bladder,

00:34:18.411 --> 00:34:22.328
viciously, tearfully
consummated wet dream like the

00:34:22.328 --> 00:34:26.010
memory bank to a computer of the
lost.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:29.944
It's a sort of aria of
description, and Pynchon can

00:34:29.944 --> 00:34:33.800
string those clauses together
like no one else.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.695
There are even longer examples
in the book, and I'm sure you

00:34:38.695 --> 00:34:42.110
noticed them.
Oedipa needs to actually touch

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:46.670
the man, and when she finally,
sort of, takes him in her arms,

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:52.102
the position she assumes looks
like that of a mother with her

00:34:52.102 --> 00:34:54.971
broken son.
And the image is much more

00:34:54.971 --> 00:34:57.900
specifically of Michelangelo's
Pieta.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:05.017
And remember the Lago di Pieta
figures prominently in the

00:35:05.017 --> 00:35:11.880
novel, both as the site of the
rout of GIs in Italy,

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:17.291
and the lake from which their
bones are taken to make charcoal

00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:21.789
filters for cigarettes.
So, the Pieta,

00:35:21.789 --> 00:35:28.085
the image of Mary with Jesus'
body broken from the cross on

00:35:28.085 --> 00:35:30.527
her lap,
is repeated,

00:35:30.527 --> 00:35:35.519
and here Oedipa comes to
inhabit that position.

00:35:35.519 --> 00:35:38.972
It's not a social role in the
way that she could be

00:35:38.972 --> 00:35:42.770
granddaughterly or motherly on
those other occasions.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:48.984
It's a religious image.
It's also a gendered religious

00:35:48.984 --> 00:35:53.559
image;
it's also an aesthetic image.

00:35:53.559 --> 00:36:00.615
But here, it's infused with her
compassionate approach to this

00:36:00.615 --> 00:36:02.380
man.
And remember,

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:05.652
in the passage that I read
about Inverarity's escape,

00:36:05.652 --> 00:36:08.800
what she left with,
as her final understanding.

00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:13.994
She has a kind of compassion
for Pierce and the way that he

00:36:13.994 --> 00:36:19.636
had surrounded himself with this
network of holdings that he had

00:36:19.636 --> 00:36:22.949
tried to escape from in some
way.

00:36:22.949 --> 00:36:30.129
So, if you cannot,
finally, have a pattern resolve

00:36:30.129 --> 00:36:35.550
into a clarity of truth or
meaning,

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:42.712
what you can do instead is
inhabit a role where you will be

00:36:42.712 --> 00:36:49.010
in contact with the very
material of social life.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:52.985
And that's what that mattress
is: totally imbued with the

00:36:52.985 --> 00:36:57.530
bodily detritus of a human life,
actually of many human lives.

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:59.751
She reflects,
later, on the set of all men

00:36:59.751 --> 00:37:01.540
who had slept on that mattress.

00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:11.215
Pynchon wants to imagine a very
physical repository for the

00:37:11.215 --> 00:37:17.603
social, and especially for the
human, affective dimensions of

00:37:17.603 --> 00:37:21.469
the social.
That's why Oedipa has all

00:37:21.469 --> 00:37:24.130
these men stripped away from
her.

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.594
Remember, she says that,
as she is growing more and more

00:37:27.594 --> 00:37:30.366
desperate at the end,
that her men were being

00:37:30.366 --> 00:37:32.760
stripped away from her one by
one.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.073
And so, when she comes to be
isolated in this way,

00:37:36.073 --> 00:37:38.575
she can finally see and
meditate upon,

00:37:38.575 --> 00:37:40.807
in a new way,
all those systems of

00:37:40.807 --> 00:37:43.826
communication.
And she has that vision of the

00:37:43.826 --> 00:37:46.437
telephone wires,
and she looks up at them as she

00:37:46.437 --> 00:37:49.603
has just doubted all of the
possibilities for making sense

00:37:49.603 --> 00:37:51.769
of the post horn and the
Tristero.

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:55.686
She looks up at the telephone
wires, and she thinks about all

00:37:55.686 --> 00:37:57.710
the messages,
unintelligible,

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:01.404
full of human longing,
going back and forth across

00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:04.908
those wires.
So, if Pynchon gives us the

00:38:04.908 --> 00:38:09.260
pattern of meaning,
rather than meaning itself in

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:13.075
this novel,
he also gives us a vision of

00:38:13.075 --> 00:38:16.530
what it means to embody that
pattern.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:22.908
This is very different from
Nabokov's idea of embodiment as

00:38:22.908 --> 00:38:27.230
a kind of alternate or rival
creativity.

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.317
Remember, I argued that Lolita
has a dead child,

00:38:31.317 --> 00:38:37.076
and she dies in childbirth,
in a way, because it's a kind

00:38:37.076 --> 00:38:44.219
of creativity that Nabokov wants
to cancel, or that Humbert wants

00:38:44.219 --> 00:38:47.164
to cancel.
In this novel,

00:38:47.164 --> 00:38:52.992
it's not a rival creativity.
It's what creativity has to be,

00:38:52.992 --> 00:38:56.956
in the literary sense.
Now, Pynchon was a student of

00:38:56.956 --> 00:39:01.162
Nabokov for a couple of years at
Cornell University in the early

00:39:01.162 --> 00:39:03.900
'60s, so he took courses with
Nabokov.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.807
I don't know how close they
were, but he certainly learned a

00:39:08.807 --> 00:39:14.906
few things from Nabokov.
This is something he revises

00:39:14.906 --> 00:39:21.901
from that old teacher.
He is imagining a literary form

00:39:21.901 --> 00:39:27.239
that is soaked in the stuff of
social life.

00:39:27.239 --> 00:39:32.008
So, if you only get a sniff of
the tear gas in Barth,

00:39:32.008 --> 00:39:35.860
here you get a whole draught
full of it.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:43.420
And what I think he is
rejecting: if you look on page

00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.010
95 (oops.
That's not the one I want.

00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:55.191
Yes, it is 95.
If you look on page 95…)

00:39:55.191 --> 00:40:00.134
there is a different vision of
what the artwork could look like

00:40:00.134 --> 00:40:04.918
that I think we're meant to put
next to that vision of Oedipa

00:40:04.918 --> 00:40:10.225
with the suffering sailor.
This is when it first occurs to

00:40:10.225 --> 00:40:15.440
her that the whole world is
being organized around her:

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.430
Nothing of the night's
could touch her.

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:20.525
Nothing did.
The repetition of symbols was

00:40:20.525 --> 00:40:22.307
to be enough,
without trauma,

00:40:22.307 --> 00:40:24.407
as well, perhaps,
to attenuate it,

00:40:24.407 --> 00:40:27.780
or even jar it altogether loose
from her memory.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.086
She was meant to remember.
She faced that possibility as

00:40:32.086 --> 00:40:35.024
she might the toy street from a
high balcony,

00:40:35.024 --> 00:40:38.733
roller-coaster ride,
feeding time among the beasts

00:40:38.733 --> 00:40:42.855
in a zoo, any death wish that
can be consummated by some

00:40:42.855 --> 00:40:46.384
minimum gesture.
She touched the edge of its

00:40:46.384 --> 00:40:49.735
voluptuous field,
knowing it would be lovely

00:40:49.735 --> 00:40:52.502
beyond dreams,
simply to submit to it,

00:40:52.502 --> 00:40:55.200
that not gravity's pull,
laws of ballistics,

00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.710
feral ravening promised more
delight.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:01.900
She tested it, shivering.
I am meant to remember.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.581
Each clue that comes is
supposed to have its own

00:41:05.581 --> 00:41:08.949
clarity, its fine chances for
permanence,

00:41:08.949 --> 00:41:12.931
but then she wondered if the
gemlike clues were only some

00:41:12.931 --> 00:41:17.269
kind of compensation to make up
for her having lost the direct

00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:20.489
epileptic Word,
the cry that might abolish the

00:41:20.489 --> 00:41:21.300
night.

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:30.032
This is a meditation on both
the joy and the loss of literary

00:41:30.032 --> 00:41:33.800
substitution for the real or for
the truth,

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:37.764
the substitution of abstract
pattern for something like

00:41:37.764 --> 00:41:41.349
comprehensible meaning.
So here, she's kind of

00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:45.961
enthralled with the idea that
these gemlike clues--that's a

00:41:45.961 --> 00:41:50.652
very Nabokovian moment--the
gemlike clues that are gathering

00:41:50.652 --> 00:41:54.548
around her would be a
compensation for the loss of

00:41:54.548 --> 00:41:59.432
that real access to revelation.
And this has this religious

00:41:59.432 --> 00:42:02.618
sense to it.
It's not just the religious

00:42:02.618 --> 00:42:06.010
instant of looking down at San
Narciso;

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:10.782
it's the religious sense of the
capitalized Word that comes back

00:42:10.782 --> 00:42:14.267
a couple of times towards the
end of the novel,

00:42:14.267 --> 00:42:17.212
the epileptic Word.
The "Word," capitalized,

00:42:17.212 --> 00:42:20.170
always refers back to the
beginning of the Gospel of John,

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:24.962
where John describes Christ as
the Word made flesh:

00:42:24.962 --> 00:42:30.618
"The Word was with God and the
Word was God and the Word was

00:42:30.618 --> 00:42:34.739
made flesh and came to dwell
among us."

00:42:34.739 --> 00:42:37.900
So, Pynchon is using that
religious vocabulary:

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.854
not just the religious imagery
of the Pieta,

00:42:40.854 --> 00:42:44.769
but the religious vocabulary of
the capitalized Word.

00:42:44.769 --> 00:42:49.808
So, you can have a kind of
system of symbols that's gemlike

00:42:49.808 --> 00:42:54.684
and pleasurable and that calls
you to submit to it as it does

00:42:54.684 --> 00:42:57.789
here for Oedipa,
but in the end there is

00:42:57.789 --> 00:43:00.556
something more that her search
will produce,

00:43:00.556 --> 00:43:03.130
and that is the moment of
compassion.

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:08.422
And, I would submit to you that
tears are just all over this

00:43:08.422 --> 00:43:11.150
novel.
I don't know if you noticed it,

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:13.420
but there are many,
many examples.

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.290
I'll just give you a few.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:20.013
First of all,
there are the tears that

00:43:20.013 --> 00:43:23.303
accumulate in her bubble shades
when she's in Mexico looking at

00:43:23.303 --> 00:43:26.593
Remedios Varo"s painting of the
women in the tower embroidering

00:43:26.593 --> 00:43:29.139
the long tapestries that become
the world.

00:43:29.139 --> 00:43:34.579
So, that sense of isolation in
the tower makes her weep.

00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:39.500
On 117 you can see another
example.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:51.829
This is Mucho talking about the
Muzak:

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:53.061
"Oedipa,
the human voice,

00:43:53.061 --> 00:43:54.579
you know, it's a flipping
miracle."

00:43:54.579 --> 00:43:57.632
His eyes brimming,
reflecting the color of

00:43:57.632 --> 00:44:00.727
beer.
113, this is Dr.

00:44:00.727 --> 00:44:06.446
Hilarius, crying:
"Tears sprang to Hilarius'

00:44:06.446 --> 00:44:09.364
eyes.
'You aren't going to shoot,'"

00:44:09.364 --> 00:44:12.224
he says.
146, in her moment of

00:44:12.224 --> 00:44:18.425
desperation when she loses her
connection to the Inamorato

00:44:18.425 --> 00:44:22.560
Anonymous,
or when she's about to talk to

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.913
him: "She waited,
inexplicable tears beginning to

00:44:26.913 --> 00:44:30.360
build up pressure around her
eyes."

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.760
Back on 108.

00:44:36.639 --> 00:44:39.566
This is the nurse who has just
escaped from Dr.

00:44:39.566 --> 00:44:42.429
Hilarius: "'He thinks someone's
after him.'

00:44:42.429 --> 00:44:46.130
Tear streaks had meandered down
over the nurse's cheekbones."

00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:50.177
It's not just that we could
explain any of these moments of

00:44:50.177 --> 00:44:53.766
tears.
It's that Pynchon describes

00:44:53.766 --> 00:44:59.722
them all, notes them all.
So, this is a novel that's full

00:44:59.722 --> 00:45:04.274
of people crying,
which is an odd thing to think

00:45:04.274 --> 00:45:09.408
about when you think back to
Pynchon's reputation as a

00:45:09.408 --> 00:45:14.912
metafictional novelist,
as someone preeminently

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:20.739
preoccupied with the formal
aspects of fiction.

00:45:20.739 --> 00:45:26.463
What you find when you actually
open up Pynchon's novels is an

00:45:26.463 --> 00:45:31.530
incredibly rich world of human
detritus, of history.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:36.806
In Gravity's Rainbow he
did enormous amounts of research

00:45:36.806 --> 00:45:41.827
in newspapers from the Second
World War in London where some

00:45:41.827 --> 00:45:45.812
of the novel is set,
so that you can go to

00:45:45.812 --> 00:45:51.639
newspapers and find the ads that
he talks about in the novels.

00:45:51.639 --> 00:45:56.503
So, he combines this very
attentive set of details,

00:45:56.503 --> 00:46:01.269
which are not always,
and often are not at all,

00:46:01.269 --> 00:46:03.941
the aesthetic details with
which Nabokov filled

00:46:03.941 --> 00:46:06.090
Lolita.
Remember,

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:09.732
when I asked you about the
specificity of America in On

00:46:09.732 --> 00:46:13.822
the Road, and I asked
you to think about whether there

00:46:13.822 --> 00:46:17.372
was anything there at all?
In On the Road,

00:46:17.372 --> 00:46:20.363
there isn't anything.
In Nabokov there is,

00:46:20.363 --> 00:46:23.145
but it's usually aesthetic:
how things look,

00:46:23.145 --> 00:46:25.733
the look of a hotel,
the look of a field,

00:46:25.733 --> 00:46:28.710
the look of a child,
the look of a woman.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:33.685
In Pynchon, often,
these are somehow social

00:46:33.685 --> 00:46:38.898
details about people talking to
other people,

00:46:38.898 --> 00:46:43.992
political things,
places, and how houses are

00:46:43.992 --> 00:46:48.250
arranged.
But there is a sense that these

00:46:48.250 --> 00:46:51.130
are social worlds,
not just patterns,

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:55.929
even though at the beginning
that's how Oedipa sees them.

00:46:55.929 --> 00:46:59.368
As she goes further and further
in to her search for

00:46:59.368 --> 00:47:03.075
knowledge--and finally her
abandonment of that search of

00:47:03.075 --> 00:47:06.716
knowledge--she sees more and
more that this is not just

00:47:06.716 --> 00:47:10.336
pattern,
that it's these storm systems

00:47:10.336 --> 00:47:14.812
of suffering and need.
So, I think this is what

00:47:14.812 --> 00:47:20.105
Pynchon brings to the string of
meditations on what language can

00:47:20.105 --> 00:47:22.668
do,
and what the novel is for,

00:47:22.668 --> 00:47:27.420
that I began my lecture today
with, just recapping for you.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:32.860
He's trying to imagine a novel
that meditates both on these

00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.550
structures of meaning that imbue
the real world,

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:44.039
such that there is no name that
isn't already saturated with

00:47:44.039 --> 00:47:48.989
associations,
and that within such a world,

00:47:48.989 --> 00:47:55.805
if you enter into it,
you can come to encounter the

00:47:55.805 --> 00:47:58.905
real.
And the real is that sense of

00:47:58.905 --> 00:48:03.050
suffering, and that the novel
can make you feel things,

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:08.681
both the pleasure of humor or
the pleasure of beauty,

00:48:08.681 --> 00:48:12.579
but also that sense of
compassion.

00:48:12.579 --> 00:48:16.433
And I don't know about you,
but I feel compassion for

00:48:16.433 --> 00:48:19.376
Oedipa.
I feel like she's a real

00:48:19.376 --> 00:48:23.089
character.
I think she is a character that

00:48:23.089 --> 00:48:26.447
you can--if not identify
with--at least,

00:48:26.447 --> 00:48:30.150
you can understand and be
interested in.

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:34.637
So, Pynchon offers us that,
and in our next reading,

00:48:34.637 --> 00:48:38.879
when we start with Toni
Morrison and also Maxine Hong

00:48:38.879 --> 00:48:42.497
Kingston,
what you're going to see is a

00:48:42.497 --> 00:48:45.390
kind of shift.
So all these meditations on

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:48.879
language, these different ways
of thinking about how language

00:48:48.879 --> 00:48:52.920
interacts with the real,
and what you can do by messing

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.050
with language,
are almost, I would say,

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.615
taken as read,
taken as the starting point

00:48:59.615 --> 00:49:04.025
from which a writer like
Morrison or Kingston will begin

00:49:04.025 --> 00:49:08.997
to rethink how those things can
be used in relation to the real

00:49:08.997 --> 00:49:11.815
world.
So, that's where we'll start

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:14.579
when we think about Morrison
next week.

00:49:14.579 --> 00:49:18.438
Let me just also say there are
a thousand things to talk about

00:49:18.438 --> 00:49:21.284
in this novel,
so I hope you'll get to some of

00:49:21.284 --> 00:49:24.139
them in section.
And if you want to write about

00:49:24.139 --> 00:49:27.000
this, it's a very rich novel for
writing your papers.

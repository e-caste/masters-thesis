00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.146
Professor Paul Bloom:
This is going to begin a

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:20.100
two-lecture sequence on social
psychology on how we think about

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.778
ourselves, how we think about
other people,

00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:25.840
how we think about other groups
of people.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.064
We've talked a lot about the
capacities of the human mind and

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:36.375
some of these capacities involve
adapting and dealing with the

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.966
material world.
So, we have to choose foods,

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:43.909
we have to navigate around the
world, we have to recognize

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:46.518
objects,
we have to be able to

00:00:46.518 --> 00:00:49.510
understand physical
interactions.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.760
But probably the most
interesting aspect of our

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.142
evolved minds is our capacity to
understand and deal with other

00:00:57.142 --> 00:01:00.467
people.
We are intensely interested in

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:06.685
how other people work.
The story that was a dominant

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:12.529
news story in 2005 was this.
And some of you--this--for

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:16.294
those of you who aren't seeing
the screen, is the separation of

00:01:16.294 --> 00:01:21.489
Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt.
I remember where I was when I

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:24.719
first heard about this.
[laughter]

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.250
And it's an interesting sight.
Just remember--stepping back.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.680
As psychologists we have to
question the natural.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.250
We have to take things that are
commonsense and explore them.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.768
And one thing which just
happens is, we're fascinated by

00:01:39.768 --> 00:01:42.275
this stuff.
We're fascinated by the lives

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.756
of celebrities.
We're fascinated by the social

00:01:44.756 --> 00:01:48.762
lives of other people.
And it's an interesting

00:01:48.762 --> 00:01:52.693
question to ask why.
And this is one of the

00:01:52.693 --> 00:01:56.351
questions which I'm going to
deal with in the next couple of

00:01:56.351 --> 00:02:00.132
lectures but before I get to the
theory of social psychology I

00:02:00.132 --> 00:02:03.170
want to talk about an individual
difference.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.592
So, we devoted a lecture early
on--of a couple of weeks ago,

00:02:07.592 --> 00:02:11.640
to individual differences
across people in intelligence

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.846
and personality.
I want to talk a little bit

00:02:14.846 --> 00:02:18.764
about an individual difference
in our social natures and then I

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:22.555
want people to do a test that
will explore where you stand on

00:02:22.555 --> 00:02:25.430
a continuum.
That test is the piece of paper

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.204
you have in front of you.
Anybody who doesn't have it

00:02:28.204 --> 00:02:30.920
please raise your hand and one
of the teaching fellows will

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.927
bring it to you.
You don't know what to do yet

00:02:33.927 --> 00:02:37.732
with it so don't worry.
The test was developed actually

00:02:37.732 --> 00:02:41.703
by Malcolm Gladwell who is a
science writer--in his wonderful

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:45.940
book The Tipping Point.
And as he introduces the test,

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.481
Gladwell recounts another
experiment done by Stanley

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:53.647
Milgram, of course famous for
his obedience work but he did a

00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:58.523
lot of interesting things.
And one classic study he did

00:02:58.523 --> 00:03:04.710
was he gave a package to 160
people randomly chosen in Omaha,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.139
Nebraska and he asked these
people to get the package

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:14.419
somehow – and this was many
years ago before the internet,

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.640
before e-mail – to get the
package to a stockbroker who

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.580
worked in Boston but lived in
Sharon,

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.319
Massachusetts.
What he found was that most

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.458
people were able to do it.
Nobody, of course,

00:03:28.458 --> 00:03:32.093
knew this man but they knew
people who might know people who

00:03:32.093 --> 00:03:35.539
would know this man.
So, most people succeeded.

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:41.027
Most people were able to get
the packages to this man and it

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:45.120
took at maximum six degrees of
separation,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.541
which is where the famous
phrase comes about that we're

00:03:48.541 --> 00:03:51.709
all separated from another
person by six degrees of

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.449
separation.
This is not true in general.

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.406
This was a very--a single
experiment done within the

00:03:57.406 --> 00:03:59.900
United States,
but the idea is appealing,

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.388
that people are connected to
one another via chains of

00:04:05.388 --> 00:04:09.466
people.
But what Milgram found that was

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:15.456
particularly interesting was
that in about half of the cases

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:19.720
these packages went through two
people.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:25.210
That is, if you plot the
relationships between people--We

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.740
can take each person in this
room,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.126
find everybody you know and who
knows you and draw a line,

00:04:33.126 --> 00:04:37.590
but if we were to do this you
wouldn't find an even mesh of

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.079
wires.
Rather, you'd find that some

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:43.186
people are clusters.
Some people are what Gladwell

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:45.949
calls "connectors."
It's like air traffic.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.060
Air traffic used to be
everything flew to places local

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.240
to it but now there's a system
of hubs,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.810
Chicago O'Hare for instance or
Newark where planes fly through.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.230
Some people are hubs.
Some people are the sort of

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.385
people who know a lot of people.
Some people in this room might

00:05:08.385 --> 00:05:12.170
be hubs, and it is not
impossible to find out.

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.230
The piece of paper you have
here is 250 names chosen

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.100
randomly from a Manhattan phone
book.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.666
They capture a range of
ethnicities, different parts of

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:30.790
the world, different national
origins.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.272
Here's what I'd like you to do.
And I'll give about five

00:05:33.272 --> 00:05:36.979
minutes for this.
Go through these names and

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:43.086
circle how many people you know.
Now, the rules of this are,

00:05:43.086 --> 00:05:48.600
to know somebody you have
to--they have to know you back.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:56.314
So, if it's a celebrity--Well,
here--one of the names here is

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:59.112
Johnson.
Now, I've heard of Magic

00:05:59.112 --> 00:06:02.074
Johnson but Magic Johnson has
never heard of me,

00:06:02.074 --> 00:06:04.658
so I cannot circle it.
On the other hand,

00:06:04.658 --> 00:06:06.899
our department chair is Marcia
Johnson.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.800
She has heard of me,
so I could circle it.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.746
Go through and circle it.
Circle all the people you know

00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:17.454
who know you.
Those are the people you're

00:06:17.454 --> 00:06:19.792
connected to.
If you know more than one

00:06:19.792 --> 00:06:23.110
person with the same last name,
circle it twice.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.924
If you don't have this piece of
paper and you want to

00:06:24.924 --> 00:06:26.948
participate, please raise your
hand and one of the teaching

00:06:26.948 --> 00:06:28.100
fellows will bring it to you.

00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:09.866
I'm going to talk a little bit
more about this while people go

00:08:09.866 --> 00:08:12.678
through this.
The issue of connections

00:08:12.678 --> 00:08:17.662
between people is intellectually
interesting for many reasons and

00:08:17.662 --> 00:08:22.489
might allow us to develop some
generalizations about how people

00:08:22.489 --> 00:08:25.781
interact.
The game of Six Degrees of

00:08:25.781 --> 00:08:29.675
Separation has,
of course, turned into a famous

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:34.840
movie trivia thing revolving
around the actor Kevin Bacon,

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.500
I think chosen just because it
rhymes with "separation."

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.279
And the game of "Six Degrees of
Kevin Bacon" is played by taking

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:47.906
any actor and computing how many
steps it would take to get to

00:08:47.906 --> 00:08:50.754
Kevin Bacon.
And some computer scientists

00:08:50.754 --> 00:08:53.741
have developed this.
They've gone through each of

00:08:53.741 --> 00:08:57.517
the quarter million actors and
actresses on the international

00:08:57.517 --> 00:09:00.789
movie database and computed
their "Bacon number."

00:09:00.789 --> 00:09:05.045
And the Bacon number is the
number of steps it takes for

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:09.468
them to get to Kevin Bacon.
So for instance,

00:09:09.468 --> 00:09:16.684
Ed Asner was in the movie
Change of--;"JFK" with Kevin

00:09:16.684 --> 00:09:20.556
Bacon.
So, Ed Asner has a Bacon number

00:09:20.556 --> 00:09:23.573
of one.
Elvis Presley was in the movie

00:09:23.573 --> 00:09:27.694
"Change of Habit" with Ed Asner
and that's his closest

00:09:27.694 --> 00:09:32.243
connection to Kevin Bacon.
So, Elvis Presley has a Bacon

00:09:32.243 --> 00:09:35.898
number of two.
It turns out that if you look

00:09:35.898 --> 00:09:39.898
at the 2.5--sorry,
the quarter million people on

00:09:39.898 --> 00:09:44.410
the movie database and compute
their Bacon number,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:48.935
the average Bacon number is 2.8.
That's how many steps your

00:09:48.935 --> 00:09:51.309
average person is away from
Kevin Bacon.

00:09:51.309 --> 00:09:55.222
You could then,
for any actor or actress,

00:09:55.222 --> 00:10:00.100
compute the most connected one.
So, the most connected one

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:03.211
would be the one for whom the
quarter million are,

00:10:03.211 --> 00:10:05.559
on average, the most connected
to.

00:10:05.559 --> 00:10:09.061
And the answer of the most
connected actor or actress is

00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:11.920
reasonably surprising.
Does anybody want to guess?

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:19.094
I'll start you off with the
wrong answer and this,

00:10:19.094 --> 00:10:21.900
by the way, can be found on
this web site.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:26.343
It's not John Wayne.
John Wayne has been in many

00:10:26.343 --> 00:10:29.749
movies, 180 movies,
in fact, over sixty years,

00:10:29.749 --> 00:10:34.138
but he isn't well connected at
all because mostly he was in

00:10:34.138 --> 00:10:38.680
westerns so we saw the same
people over and over again.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:47.900
Meryl Streep also isn't it
because Meryl Streep has the

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.509
misfortune of playing only in
good movies.

00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:54.133
[laughter]
So, she has no connection with

00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:57.610
people like Adam Sandler and
John-Claude Van Damme.

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:02.269
[laughter] Guess.
Any guesses?

00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.974
Student:
Christopher Walken

00:11:02.974 --> 00:11:03.955
Student:
Nicholas Cage Professor Paul

00:11:03.955 --> 00:11:04.980
Bloom: Christopher Walken is
a good one.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.960
We could look it up.
I only know a few names here.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.450
Christopher Walken is not a
finalist.

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:11.789
Nicolas Cage is an interesting
case.

00:11:11.789 --> 00:11:14.289
Has Nicolas Cage been in good
movies?

00:11:14.289 --> 00:11:18.888
I don't want to get--I'm going
to get more controversial than I

00:11:18.888 --> 00:11:21.780
want to.
Student:

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:27.230
A guy who is one step above an
extra.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.710
He's like a B-list actor at
best.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:34.105
The most connected guy,
and I think this shows that

00:11:34.105 --> 00:11:36.830
you're right,
is Rod Steiger.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.815
He's the most connected actor
in the history of acting because

00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:44.799
it isn't that he's been in more
movies than everybody else.

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:48.152
Michael Caine has probably been
in the most movies of any person

00:11:48.152 --> 00:11:50.759
on earth, but he's been in all
sorts of movies.

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:54.604
He was in "On the Waterfront,"
"In the Heat of the Night," and

00:11:54.604 --> 00:11:56.809
really bad movies like
"Carpool."

00:11:56.809 --> 00:12:00.274
He's been in dramas and crime
serials, thrillers,

00:12:00.274 --> 00:12:03.161
westerns, horror movies,
science fiction,

00:12:03.161 --> 00:12:08.686
musicals.
Now, some people are like Rod

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:11.598
Steiger.
So, some people in their

00:12:11.598 --> 00:12:15.134
day-to-day lives have many
interactions and I think one of

00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:18.360
the things we know from
interacting with people is we

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.090
can distinguish them from other
people.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.230
How many people have finished
their things right now?

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:26.676
Okay.
I know one person in the

00:12:26.676 --> 00:12:30.575
department who is one of the
most connected people I know on

00:12:30.575 --> 00:12:33.193
earth.
If I wanted--If I really had to

00:12:33.193 --> 00:12:36.262
talk to Rumsfeld,
I'd go to this person and say,

00:12:36.262 --> 00:12:39.070
"Can you get me in touch with
Rumsfeld?"

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:43.440
If I wanted to get somebody
whacked, I'd ask this guy.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.365
[laughter]
Then I know someone else in the

00:12:45.365 --> 00:12:46.773
department and,
as best I know,

00:12:46.773 --> 00:12:50.141
I'm the only person she knows.
[laughter]

00:12:50.141 --> 00:12:58.290
So, how many people scores
below ten on this?

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:07.530
How many between ten and twenty?
Between twenty and thirty?

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:15.050
Thirty and forty?
Between forty and fifty?

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:21.772
Fifty and sixty?
How many people scored above

00:13:21.772 --> 00:13:28.389
sixty?
Anybody above sixty?

00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:31.509
Gladwell has done this in a lot
of places.

00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:36.230
The average is twenty-one among
a college crowd.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:40.110
Some people score as high as
over 100.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:43.041
The older you are,
the more--the higher you tend

00:13:43.041 --> 00:13:46.533
to score, maybe obviously,
not--the longer you've been in

00:13:46.533 --> 00:13:49.340
the country the higher you tend
to score.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.683
Journalists tend to score
reasonably high,

00:13:52.683 --> 00:13:56.842
academics not so high,
and--but what Gladwell points

00:13:56.842 --> 00:13:59.860
out is some people have the
gift.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:03.315
Some people are more social
than others and this connects in

00:14:03.315 --> 00:14:08.395
all sorts of interesting ways.
The issue of connection has

00:14:08.395 --> 00:14:15.044
social factors and it's one
answer that sociologists give

00:14:15.044 --> 00:14:21.174
for why it's good to go to Yale.
So, one answer is,

00:14:21.174 --> 00:14:26.660
well, because of the great
intellectual benefits.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.429
Put that aside.
Let's be more cynical here.

00:14:30.429 --> 00:14:36.909
Another answer is that you
develop powerful friends.

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:40.255
And that's closer,
but the interesting answer

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:44.817
sociologists come to is it's not
so much you develop powerful

00:14:44.817 --> 00:14:48.653
friends;
rather, you develop powerful

00:14:48.653 --> 00:14:51.985
acquaintances.
Through Yale you know a lot of

00:14:51.985 --> 00:14:55.399
people and they don't have to be
close friends but they are

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:58.436
acquaintances.
And sociologists point out that

00:14:58.436 --> 00:15:02.049
for a lot of aspects of your
life, like getting a job,

00:15:02.049 --> 00:15:04.584
acquaintances matter,
connections matter,

00:15:04.584 --> 00:15:07.878
and the connections you
establish by going to a place

00:15:07.878 --> 00:15:11.870
like Yale hold you in good stead
for the rest of your life,

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:14.893
above and beyond any
intellectual qualities that this

00:15:14.893 --> 00:15:15.940
place may offer.

00:15:19.299 --> 00:15:21.491
Here's what we're going to do
for the next lecture and a half,

00:15:21.491 --> 00:15:23.632
two lectures.
We're first going to talk about

00:15:23.632 --> 00:15:25.644
the self.
Then we're going to talk about

00:15:25.644 --> 00:15:28.717
the self and other;
basically, differences between

00:15:28.717 --> 00:15:33.080
how we think of ourselves and
how we think about other people.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.683
Then we're going to talk
exclusively about how we think

00:15:35.683 --> 00:15:38.383
about other people and then
we'll talk about how we think

00:15:38.383 --> 00:15:41.083
about groups like Harvard
students or gay people or black

00:15:41.083 --> 00:15:41.710
people.

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:50.767
I'll start with my favorite
finding of all time and this is

00:15:50.767 --> 00:15:56.236
about the self.
And this is about the spotlight

00:15:56.236 --> 00:15:59.369
effect.
So, my mornings are often

00:15:59.369 --> 00:16:03.315
rushed because I have two kids.
So, I get up and sometimes I

00:16:03.315 --> 00:16:05.050
don't set the alarm and I get up
late;

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.540
I stagger out of bed;
I wake the kids;

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:10.820
I greet the servants;
I get ready;

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.399
[laughter] I make breakfast.
I run out of the house and then

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:17.470
usually around 3 o'clock
somebody points out,

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:20.424
in one case a homeless man,
that I have a big glob of

00:16:20.424 --> 00:16:23.209
shaving cream in my ear
or--because I neglected to

00:16:23.209 --> 00:16:25.879
actually look in the mirror
while I shaved.

00:16:25.879 --> 00:16:29.544
Or I have once been to a party
and I found my shirt was

00:16:29.544 --> 00:16:31.919
misaligned, seriously
misaligned,

00:16:31.919 --> 00:16:35.051
not one button but--Anyway,
[laughter]

00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:39.789
so--and so I feel when this
happens I'm very immature.

00:16:39.789 --> 00:16:42.714
And I basically feel this is
the end of the world,

00:16:42.714 --> 00:16:45.340
this is humiliating and
everybody notices.

00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.075
And so the question is,
how many people notice when

00:16:49.075 --> 00:16:52.724
something happens?
And the spotlight effect--Well,

00:16:52.724 --> 00:16:56.200
before talking about my
favorite experiment ever,

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.810
there is an episode of "The
Simpsons" that provides a

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.269
beautiful illustration of the
spotlight effect.

00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:05.663
And then it has a beautiful
illustration of psychological

00:17:05.663 --> 00:17:10.450
testing, so I'll give you them
quickly one after the other.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.533
So, Tom Gilovich,
a social psychologist,

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:18.039
was interested in the question
of the spotlight effect,

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:20.850
which is when we wear a pink
shirt to work,

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.460
shaving cream in our ear or
whatever,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:28.607
do we systematically
overestimate how much other

00:17:28.607 --> 00:17:32.440
people notice?
He did a series of experiments.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:37.025
And in one experiment what he
did was he got in the subjects

00:17:37.025 --> 00:17:40.599
– standard Intro Psych drill
– and said,

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:45.326
"I want you to wear a T-shirt
for the next day and I want it

00:17:45.326 --> 00:17:49.092
to have a picture on it,"
and he got them to wear

00:17:49.092 --> 00:17:53.482
T-shirts that had pictures on it
that were the most embarrassing

00:17:53.482 --> 00:17:56.200
pictures that they could have on
it.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:59.964
It turns out that if you ask
people what's the worst picture

00:17:59.964 --> 00:18:02.900
to have on the T-shirt that you
are wearing,

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:11.930
the number one answer is Hitler
tied with Barry Manilow.

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:17.076
[laughter]
The best pictures to have on

00:18:17.076 --> 00:18:22.630
your T-shirt are Martin Luther
King Jr.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:26.308
and Jerry Seinfeld.
It turns out that people--And

00:18:26.308 --> 00:18:29.668
then he had them go about their
day and asked them,

00:18:29.668 --> 00:18:32.490
"How many people noticed your
T-shirt?"

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.277
And then the psychologists went
around and they asked the

00:18:36.277 --> 00:18:40.200
people, "How many of you noticed
this person's T-shirt?"

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.569
And it turned out they got it
wrong by a factor of about two.

00:18:45.569 --> 00:18:48.717
They thought,
say, 100 noticed,

00:18:48.717 --> 00:18:53.259
but fifty people noticed.
And across study after study

00:18:53.259 --> 00:18:56.740
after study Gilovich and his
colleagues have found support

00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:00.625
for the spotlight effect,
which is that you believe that

00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:04.539
people are noticing you all the
time but they aren't.

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:06.890
They're busy noticing
themselves.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:12.609
And this is actually a useful
thing to know.

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:17.482
Gilovich got interested in this
because he's interested in the

00:19:17.482 --> 00:19:21.250
psychology of regret.
And it turns out that if you

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:25.180
actually ask dying people,
or really old people basically,

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.869
"What do you regret from your
life?"

00:19:27.869 --> 00:19:33.670
they regret the things as a
rule that they didn't try.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.899
But when you asked them why
they didn't try it the answers

00:19:37.899 --> 00:19:40.569
tended to be "I would look
silly."

00:19:40.569 --> 00:19:42.966
And it turns out,
interesting to know,

00:19:42.966 --> 00:19:46.851
that people just don't care as
much as other people think you

00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:49.320
are.
You could take that as good

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.222
news or bad news but the
spotlight is not on us as much

00:19:53.222 --> 00:19:56.610
as we think it is.
There's a second effect

00:19:56.610 --> 00:20:00.920
Gilovich discovers called "the
transparency effect."

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.750
And the transparency effect is
quite interesting.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:10.143
The transparency effect is that
we believe that we're more

00:20:10.143 --> 00:20:17.046
transparent than we are.
I need somebody up here who

00:20:17.046 --> 00:20:22.510
thinks that he or she is a bad
liar.

00:20:26.349 --> 00:20:29.180
Just--I just need you to say
three sentences.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.519
I'll even tell you what it is
ahead of time.

00:20:31.519 --> 00:20:34.117
I'm going to ask you three
questions: "Have you been in

00:20:34.117 --> 00:20:36.160
London?
Do you have a younger sibling?"

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.880
and "Do you like sushi?"
I want you to answer with one

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.186
of those answers there.
I want you to lie about one of

00:20:44.186 --> 00:20:47.064
them.
The task will be for everybody

00:20:47.064 --> 00:20:51.540
else to recognize and guess
which one you're lying about.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.230
Do you want to go up?
Yeah.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:58.420
And I will even write down
which one you should lie on.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.870
So, I want you to lie as to
that number.

00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:03.760
Okay?

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:15.039
Have you ever been in London?
Student:

00:21:15.039 --> 00:21:19.176
No, I have not been in London.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:21:19.176 --> 00:21:21.561
Do you have a younger sibling?
Student:

00:21:21.561 --> 00:21:24.538
Yes, I have a younger sibling.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:21:24.538 --> 00:21:26.447
Do you like sushi?
Student:

00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:29.440
No, I do not like sushi.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:30.690
Okay.
Let's have a vote.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:36.290
She was lying about one of them.
Who votes for one?

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:42.529
Who votes for two?
Who votes for three?

00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:45.799
Pretty much of a tie between
two and three.

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:47.370
You could say which one you
were lying.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:52.067
Student: Three.
Professor Paul Bloom:

00:21:52.067 --> 00:21:54.599
The effect--there are two
aspects of the effect.

00:21:54.599 --> 00:22:00.279
One aspect is people are
actually quite good at lying.

00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:04.606
It is a rare person who
couldn't stand up there and

00:22:04.606 --> 00:22:09.279
everybody would figure out what
they're lying about,

00:22:09.279 --> 00:22:14.380
but the transparency effect is
we don't feel that way.

00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:18.035
We often feel like things bleed
out of us and so people will

00:22:18.035 --> 00:22:21.691
systematically overestimate the
extent to which other people

00:22:21.691 --> 00:22:24.823
notice their secrets.
And this is actually,

00:22:24.823 --> 00:22:29.273
in general, why it's sometimes
difficult to teach or to tell

00:22:29.273 --> 00:22:33.497
stories because we constantly
overestimate how much other

00:22:33.497 --> 00:22:37.792
people know.
We think of ourselves as more

00:22:37.792 --> 00:22:42.520
transparent than we are.
A second social psychological

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.460
phenomena is you think you're
terrific.

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.679
If I asked people,
"How well are you doing in

00:22:50.679 --> 00:22:55.727
Intro Psych this semester?"
and I asked you to give

00:22:55.727 --> 00:22:59.571
yourself a percentage rating
relative to the rest of the

00:22:59.571 --> 00:23:02.776
class,
then if everybody was accurate,

00:23:02.776 --> 00:23:07.928
or at least not systematically
biased, the number should add up

00:23:07.928 --> 00:23:10.125
to 50%.
Roughly half of you are doing

00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:13.092
better than average and roughly
half of you are doing worse than

00:23:13.092 --> 00:23:15.963
average.
It turns out though that people

00:23:15.963 --> 00:23:20.063
will systematically and
dramatically view themselves as

00:23:20.063 --> 00:23:24.055
better than average.
They will view themselves as

00:23:24.055 --> 00:23:28.948
better than average when asked
how good they are as a student,

00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:32.316
as a teacher,
as a lover, and particularly,

00:23:32.316 --> 00:23:34.329
as a driver.
[laughter]

00:23:34.329 --> 00:23:37.970
Everybody who drives thinks
that he or she is a wonderful

00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:40.885
driver.
This has been called the "Lake

00:23:40.885 --> 00:23:45.114
Wobegon effect" based on
Garrison Keillor's story about a

00:23:45.114 --> 00:23:48.890
place where all the children are
above average.

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:53.685
And the Lake Wobegon effect in
psychology involves a systematic

00:23:53.685 --> 00:23:57.319
bias to see ourselves as better
than average.

00:23:57.319 --> 00:24:02.361
What psychologists don't really
know is why the Lake Wobegon

00:24:02.361 --> 00:24:05.693
effect exists,
and there are a couple of

00:24:05.693 --> 00:24:09.313
proposals.
One is the nature of the

00:24:09.313 --> 00:24:13.256
feedback we get.
So, for a lot of aspects of

00:24:13.256 --> 00:24:17.215
your life you only get feedback
when you're good,

00:24:17.215 --> 00:24:20.334
when you do something good.
In a normal,

00:24:20.334 --> 00:24:22.375
productive, healthy,
happy environment,

00:24:22.375 --> 00:24:25.382
people don't scream at you
about how bad you're doing but

00:24:25.382 --> 00:24:28.444
they compliment how good you are
and that could lead to an

00:24:28.444 --> 00:24:32.150
inflated self-esteem on the part
of people in certain domains.

00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:36.440
Another possibility is there's
different criteria for goodness.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.558
For a driver,
for instance,

00:24:38.558 --> 00:24:42.960
when I ask you to rank how good
you are as a driver,

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.997
what people often do is they
think--they say,

00:24:45.997 --> 00:24:50.070
"I'm better than average," but
what they do is they focus on

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.737
one aspect of their driving.
So, some of you might say,

00:24:53.737 --> 00:24:57.269
"Hey, I'm just a great parallel
parker so I'm a great driver."

00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:59.500
Others might say,
"I'm very careful,

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.779
great driver."
Others might say,

00:25:01.779 --> 00:25:06.077
"I take chances no one else
will--great driver," [laughter]

00:25:06.077 --> 00:25:10.672
but above and beyond that there
does seem to be a psychological

00:25:10.672 --> 00:25:14.599
effect manifested here and
manifested elsewhere,

00:25:14.599 --> 00:25:17.869
which is a motivation to feel
good about yourself.

00:25:17.869 --> 00:25:22.455
You think you're important,
which is why the spotlight

00:25:22.455 --> 00:25:25.899
effect exists.
You think your thoughts bleed

00:25:25.899 --> 00:25:29.450
out, which is why the
transparency effect exists.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:32.432
But above and beyond that,
in a normal,

00:25:32.432 --> 00:25:35.650
healthy mind you think you're
terrific.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.420
And so, this shows up in all
sorts of ways.

00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.515
It shows up as well in what's
been called "the self-serving

00:25:42.515 --> 00:25:46.489
bias."
Half of you did above average

00:25:46.489 --> 00:25:50.784
on the Midterm;
half of you did below average

00:25:50.784 --> 00:25:54.614
on the Midterm,
but if I went up and asked each

00:25:54.614 --> 00:25:58.859
of you why the answers would not
be symmetrical.

00:25:58.859 --> 00:26:01.866
People who did well in the
Midterm would describe it in

00:26:01.866 --> 00:26:04.150
terms of their capacities or
abilities.

00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:08.037
They'd say, "It's because I'm
smart, hardworking,

00:26:08.037 --> 00:26:11.098
brilliant."
People who did poorly would

00:26:11.098 --> 00:26:14.990
say, "The Midterm was unfair.
I was busy.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:17.700
I have better things to do with
my time."

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.441
Professors as well--When people
get papers accepted it is

00:26:23.441 --> 00:26:27.029
because the papers are
brilliant.

00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:30.364
When they got them rejected
it's because there's a

00:26:30.364 --> 00:26:34.380
conspiracy against them by
jealous editors and reviewers.

00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.339
There is this asymmetry all the
time.

00:26:36.339 --> 00:26:40.323
The asymmetry has been found in
athletes, in CEOs and in

00:26:40.323 --> 00:26:43.869
accident reports.
And again, this is sort of a

00:26:43.869 --> 00:26:48.667
positive enhancement technique.
You think that you're terrific

00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:53.380
and because you're terrific the
good things that happen to you

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.079
are due to your terrific-ness;
the bad things are due to

00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:58.230
accident and misfortune.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.961
The final aspect of self that I
want to talk about is the idea

00:27:05.961 --> 00:27:10.343
that what you do makes sense.
And this is one of the more

00:27:10.343 --> 00:27:13.859
interesting sub domains of
social psychology.

00:27:13.859 --> 00:27:17.665
The idea was developed by the
social psychologist Leon

00:27:17.665 --> 00:27:21.829
Festinger and it's called
"Cognitive Dissonance Theory."

00:27:21.829 --> 00:27:25.483
And what Festinger was
interested in was the idea that

00:27:25.483 --> 00:27:29.206
what happens when people
experience an inconsistency in

00:27:29.206 --> 00:27:32.122
their heads.
And he claimed it causes an

00:27:32.122 --> 00:27:35.276
unpleasant emotional state,
what he described as

00:27:35.276 --> 00:27:39.134
"dissonance."
And he argued that we act so as

00:27:39.134 --> 00:27:43.196
to reduce dissonance.
When there's a contradiction in

00:27:43.196 --> 00:27:46.966
our heads we're not happy and
will take steps to make the

00:27:46.966 --> 00:27:50.722
contradiction go away.
This all sounds very general

00:27:50.722 --> 00:27:54.942
but there are some striking
demonstrations of this and how

00:27:54.942 --> 00:28:00.712
it could work in everyday life.
So, this very simple example is

00:28:00.712 --> 00:28:05.821
that--is the confirmation bias.
Some of you are politically

00:28:05.821 --> 00:28:07.843
right wing.
Some of you are politically

00:28:07.843 --> 00:28:10.092
left wing.
If I asked you what magazines

00:28:10.092 --> 00:28:13.578
you read, it turns out people
who are right wing read right

00:28:13.578 --> 00:28:16.874
wing magazines,
people who are left wing read

00:28:16.874 --> 00:28:20.693
left wing magazines,
because people don't as a rule

00:28:20.693 --> 00:28:25.199
enjoy getting information that
disconfirms what they believe

00:28:25.199 --> 00:28:27.502
in.
They want to have information

00:28:27.502 --> 00:28:30.829
that confirms what they believe
in and that supports it.

00:28:30.829 --> 00:28:33.843
If you support Bush you're
going to be looking for good

00:28:33.843 --> 00:28:36.467
news about Bush,
if you don't support him you'll

00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:41.380
be looking for bad news.
And this manifests itself in

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:47.210
all sorts of interesting ways.
I'll tell you about a very

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:50.653
simple experiment.
I'll--It was done by Louisa

00:28:50.653 --> 00:28:54.300
Egan here at Yale and it
illustrates a point which is

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:57.876
going to--which--and then I'll
talk about real world

00:28:57.876 --> 00:29:01.260
implications of this.
Very simple.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.330
You have three M&amp;Ms.
You pretest to make sure that

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:10.460
the person doesn't like any
M&amp;M more than the other.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.630
And there are three M&amp;Ms.
Who cares?

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:15.789
But then you ask them to choose
between two of them.

00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:19.410
So, suppose they choose the red
one.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.500
You've got to choose one.
So, they get to eat the red one.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.208
Now, they're offered--You take
the red one away and now they're

00:29:26.208 --> 00:29:29.200
offered a choice between the two
remaining ones.

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.401
It turns out,
to a tremendous degree,

00:29:31.401 --> 00:29:34.519
and you could imagine yourself
in that situation,

00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:39.183
they choose this one,
the one that wasn't the one

00:29:39.183 --> 00:29:43.477
they turned down.
And the claim is that when you

00:29:43.477 --> 00:29:47.231
choose this, in order to justify
your decision,

00:29:47.231 --> 00:29:50.740
you denigrate the one you
didn't choose.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:56.046
And so this one you didn't
choose is then tainted and you

00:29:56.046 --> 00:30:01.921
turn and then when compared to a
third one you favor that third

00:30:01.921 --> 00:30:05.090
one.
What's particularly interesting

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:09.834
is you get this effect easily
with undergraduates but you also

00:30:09.834 --> 00:30:13.490
get it with four-year-olds and
with monkeys.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:17.140
So, the same denigration tends
to be more general.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:22.655
Well, that's a laboratory
effect but there are some more

00:30:22.655 --> 00:30:27.970
interesting manifestations of
cognitive dissonance.

00:30:27.970 --> 00:30:31.026
One is the insufficient
justification effect,

00:30:31.026 --> 00:30:34.500
which is so famous it had a
cartoon based on it.

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.470
The guys says,
"Why should I hire you as my

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.114
consultant?"
The dog--Some dog says,

00:30:40.114 --> 00:30:44.500
"I use my special--the special
process of cognitive dissonance

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:48.380
to improve employee morale."
"How does it work?"

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:52.035
"Well, when people are in an
absurd situation their minds

00:30:52.035 --> 00:30:55.560
rationalize it by inventing a
comfortable illusion."

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.903
Not quite right.
When people are--have an

00:30:57.903 --> 00:30:59.943
internal conflict,
when there's something

00:30:59.943 --> 00:31:01.829
uncomfortable--Well,
that's right.

00:31:01.829 --> 00:31:05.347
So says to this person,
"Isn't it strange you have this

00:31:05.347 --> 00:31:08.930
dead-end job when you're twice
as smart as your boss?

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:10.932
The hours are long,
the pay is mediocre,

00:31:10.932 --> 00:31:12.627
nobody respects your
contribution,

00:31:12.627 --> 00:31:14.630
yet you freely choose to work
here.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.870
It's absurd.
No.

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.450
Wait.
There must be a reason.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:21.660
I must work here because I love
this work, I love this job."

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:26.161
[laughter] This actually works.
Here is the classic experiment

00:31:26.161 --> 00:31:28.939
by Festinger.
Gave two groups of people a

00:31:28.939 --> 00:31:31.800
really boring task,
paid one of them twenty

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.525
dollars,
which back when this study was

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:37.818
done was real money,
gave another group of subjects

00:31:37.818 --> 00:31:40.536
one dollar,
which was insultingly small,

00:31:40.536 --> 00:31:43.552
then asked them later,
"What do you think of the

00:31:43.552 --> 00:31:46.393
task?"
It turns out that the group

00:31:46.393 --> 00:31:51.340
that had--were paid a dollar
rated the task as much more fun

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.609
than the group given twenty
dollars.

00:31:54.609 --> 00:31:57.730
So, think about that for a
moment.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:31:59.727
You might have predicted it the
other way around,

00:31:59.727 --> 00:32:01.099
the twenty dollars,
"wow, well,

00:32:01.099 --> 00:32:03.015
twenty dollars,
I must have enjoyed it because

00:32:03.015 --> 00:32:04.589
I got twenty dollars," but in
fact,

00:32:04.589 --> 00:32:07.793
the logic here is the people
with twenty dollars when asked,

00:32:07.793 --> 00:32:09.640
"What do you think of the
task?"

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:15.500
could say, "It was boring.
I did it for twenty dollars."

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:18.576
The people paid one dollar were
like the character in the

00:32:18.576 --> 00:32:23.269
Dilbert cartoon.
When paid a dollar they said,

00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:27.390
"Well, I don't want to be a
donkey.

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:30.209
I don't want to be some guy who
does this boring thing for a

00:32:30.209 --> 00:32:32.561
dollar.
It wasn't that bad really,

00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:36.553
it was kind of interesting,
I learnt a lot," to justify

00:32:36.553 --> 00:32:40.309
what they did.
This has a lot of real world

00:32:40.309 --> 00:32:43.725
implications.
Festinger did a wonderful study

00:32:43.725 --> 00:32:47.985
with people--a group of people,
and he wrote this up in a book

00:32:47.985 --> 00:32:52.390
called When Prophesy Fails,
 who were convinced that

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:56.964
the world was going to end so
they went on a mountain and they

00:32:56.964 --> 00:33:00.552
waited for the world to end.
They had a certain time and

00:33:00.552 --> 00:33:02.330
date when the world was going to
end.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:09.953
He hung out with them and then
the time passed and the world

00:33:09.953 --> 00:33:12.329
didn't end.
What people then said,

00:33:12.329 --> 00:33:14.964
and this is what he was
interested in--;So,

00:33:14.964 --> 00:33:18.351
people's predictions were
totally proven wrong and they

00:33:18.351 --> 00:33:21.319
left their families,
they gave away their houses,

00:33:21.319 --> 00:33:24.119
they gave away all their
possessions, they lost all their

00:33:24.119 --> 00:33:27.385
money,
but what Festinger found was

00:33:27.385 --> 00:33:31.609
they didn't say,
"God, I'm such a moron."

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:36.039
Rather, they said,
"This is fantastic.

00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:39.763
This is exactly--This shows
that us going to the mountain

00:33:39.763 --> 00:33:43.752
has delayed the ending of the
world and this shows that we're

00:33:43.752 --> 00:33:47.779
doing exactly the right things.
I couldn't have been smarter."

00:33:47.779 --> 00:33:51.142
And in general,
when people devote a lot of

00:33:51.142 --> 00:33:54.986
energy or money or expense to
something, they are

00:33:54.986 --> 00:33:59.470
extraordinarily resistant to
having it proven wrong.

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:04.760
Now, people have manipulated
cognitive dissonance in all

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.741
sorts of ways and,
for instance,

00:34:07.741 --> 00:34:10.984
hazing.
Hazing is cognitive dissonance

00:34:10.984 --> 00:34:14.379
at work.
Fraternities and med schools

00:34:14.379 --> 00:34:18.000
and other organizations haze
people.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.094
What they do is when people
enter the group they humiliate

00:34:21.094 --> 00:34:24.134
them, they cause them pain,
they cause them various forms

00:34:24.134 --> 00:34:27.079
of torture and unpleasantness.
Why?

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:32.568
Well, because it's very
successful at getting somebody

00:34:32.568 --> 00:34:36.834
to like the group.
If I join a fraternity--it is

00:34:36.834 --> 00:34:40.845
also by the way illegal so –
but if I were to join a

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:44.704
fraternity and they say,
"Welcome to the fraternity,

00:34:44.704 --> 00:34:45.840
Dr.
Bloom.

00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.207
Here.
Have a mint," and then we have

00:34:48.207 --> 00:34:51.331
a good time and everything.
I'm thinking "okay,

00:34:51.331 --> 00:34:55.692
sounds like a fun idea."
But if I join a fraternity and

00:34:55.692 --> 00:35:00.279
they pour cow poop on my head
and make me stand in the rain

00:35:00.279 --> 00:35:04.787
for a month wearing pantyhose
while they throw rocks at me

00:35:04.787 --> 00:35:07.950
[laughter]
I then think--after it I think

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.585
"God,
I went through a lot of stuff

00:35:10.585 --> 00:35:14.710
to get into this fraternity.
It must be really good."

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.671
And in fact,
hazing through cognitive

00:35:17.671 --> 00:35:21.785
dissonance draws the inference
that this is really,

00:35:21.785 --> 00:35:25.570
really valuable and this is why
it exists.

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:30.567
If you are a political--If you
are running for office,

00:35:30.567 --> 00:35:35.375
you will tend to have
volunteers and not necessarily

00:35:35.375 --> 00:35:38.449
pay people.
One reason for this is obvious;

00:35:38.449 --> 00:35:41.400
it's cheaper not to pay people,
but the other reason is more

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.155
interesting.
If you don't pay people,

00:35:44.155 --> 00:35:47.409
they are more committed to the
cause.

00:35:47.409 --> 00:35:49.539
Again, it's cognitive
dissonance.

00:35:49.539 --> 00:35:52.365
If you pay me ten thousand
dollars a month to work for you,

00:35:52.365 --> 00:35:54.947
I'll work for you and I'll
think "I'm doing it for ten

00:35:54.947 --> 00:35:58.422
thousand dollars a month,
that makes a lot of sense," but

00:35:58.422 --> 00:36:01.750
if I do it for nothing then I
have to ask myself,

00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:05.730
"Why am I doing it?"
And I will conclude I must

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:11.659
think very highly of you.
Therapy for free tends to be

00:36:11.659 --> 00:36:15.060
useless therapy.
This is one-- [laughs]

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.956
Therapists ask for money for
all sorts of reasons,

00:36:17.956 --> 00:36:21.409
including they like money.
But one reason why they ask for

00:36:21.409 --> 00:36:24.720
money is if you don't pay for
therapy you don't think it has

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.889
any value.
You have to give up something.

00:36:26.889 --> 00:36:30.872
So, cognitive dissonance will
lead you then to think that what

00:36:30.872 --> 00:36:34.201
you are giving it up for has
some value and then you

00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:36.160
establish a liking for it.

00:36:39.369 --> 00:36:44.730
Finally, cognitive dissonance
shows up with children.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:49.386
One of the most robust and
replicated findings in education

00:36:49.386 --> 00:36:53.000
or developmental psychology is
very simple.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.358
You take two groups of kids and
you ask them to do something

00:36:57.358 --> 00:37:01.719
like draw pictures.
Half of the kids you reward.

00:37:01.719 --> 00:37:04.240
Maybe you give them a sticker
or a toy.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:09.056
The other half you don't reward.
Now, according to sort of a

00:37:09.056 --> 00:37:13.423
simple-minded view of operant
conditioning in behaviorist

00:37:13.423 --> 00:37:17.869
psychology, the children you
reward should do it more.

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:19.980
That's how operative
conditioning works.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.973
In fact though,
the children who you reward

00:37:22.973 --> 00:37:26.964
later on think that this
activity has less value and they

00:37:26.964 --> 00:37:31.239
are less likely to do it when
there's no reward present.

00:37:31.239 --> 00:37:33.457
And the idea,
again, is the kids who don't

00:37:33.457 --> 00:37:35.619
get rewarded say to themselves,
"Well,

00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:38.571
I just spent time doing it,
it must have an intrinsic

00:37:38.571 --> 00:37:41.410
value," while the children who
get rewarded say,

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:44.370
"I did it for the sticker.
I did it for the toy.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.289
I don't care much for this."
And so, rewarding children has

00:37:48.289 --> 00:37:52.309
a danger, which is if you give
them too much reward and too

00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:56.329
much a value for what they're
doing they will denigrate the

00:37:56.329 --> 00:38:01.226
activity.
Now, we need to be careful here

00:38:01.226 --> 00:38:06.440
about what's going on.
It's not simple inconsistency.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.940
So, go back to this
insufficient justification

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.409
effect.
So, the dollar group rated a

00:38:12.409 --> 00:38:15.380
task as more fun than the twenty
dollar group.

00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:17.657
And it's true;
each group needed a

00:38:17.657 --> 00:38:20.030
justification for lying about
the task.

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.552
Each group needed a
justification for saying how

00:38:22.552 --> 00:38:24.913
interesting the task was,
but they each had a

00:38:24.913 --> 00:38:27.941
justification.
They were each doing it for

00:38:27.941 --> 00:38:30.930
money after all.
So, cognitive dissonance is a

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:33.978
little bit more subtle.
It's not just that there's a

00:38:33.978 --> 00:38:37.123
clash.
Rather, we adjust our beliefs

00:38:37.123 --> 00:38:42.780
to make ourselves look more
moral and rational than we are.

00:38:42.780 --> 00:38:46.138
Go back to hazing.
There's a perfectly good reason

00:38:46.138 --> 00:38:48.519
why I let them do all those
things to me.

00:38:48.519 --> 00:38:52.535
I'm the sort of person who will
let people do those things to

00:38:52.535 --> 00:38:54.819
me.
The problem is that's not an

00:38:54.819 --> 00:38:58.137
answer I could live with.
So, cognitive dissonance

00:38:58.137 --> 00:39:02.219
motivates me to create an answer
that's more comfortable for me,

00:39:02.219 --> 00:39:07.711
an answer such as "This must be
a really wonderful group with a

00:39:07.711 --> 00:39:11.753
wonderful bunch of people."
And in other words,

00:39:11.753 --> 00:39:15.400
we are biased to believe that
we are terrific.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:18.882
So, to sum up,
there are three main findings

00:39:18.882 --> 00:39:22.690
about you that come out in
social psychology.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:27.288
One is you believe everybody
notices you even when they

00:39:27.288 --> 00:39:31.409
don't.
You're the hero of your story.

00:39:31.409 --> 00:39:34.044
The second one is,
you're terrific,

00:39:34.044 --> 00:39:37.840
you are better than average in
every possible way,

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.353
each one of you.
And finally,

00:39:40.353 --> 00:39:43.958
what you do makes sense.
If it doesn't make sense,

00:39:43.958 --> 00:39:47.539
you'll--If it doesn't make
sense or, more to the point,

00:39:47.539 --> 00:39:51.781
if it's something that you do
that's foolish or makes you look

00:39:51.781 --> 00:39:57.225
manipulative or cheap,
you'll distort it in your head

00:39:57.225 --> 00:40:02.712
so that it does make sense.
I want to move now to how we

00:40:02.712 --> 00:40:06.566
think about self and other,
how we think about ourselves

00:40:06.566 --> 00:40:09.860
relative to how we think about
other people.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:14.269
And this brings us to the
notion of attribution.

00:40:14.269 --> 00:40:20.749
So, an attribution is a claim
about the cause of somebody's

00:40:20.749 --> 00:40:26.782
behavior and Heider--;Now,
there's all sorts of reasons

00:40:26.782 --> 00:40:31.658
for somebody's behavior.
Suppose you insult me or

00:40:31.658 --> 00:40:35.292
suppose you're very kind to me.
I could say you're a kind

00:40:35.292 --> 00:40:38.318
person or you're a rude person.
I could say "this must be a

00:40:38.318 --> 00:40:41.237
great day for you" or "you must
be a lot of--under a lot of

00:40:41.237 --> 00:40:43.150
stress or you must want
something."

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:46.762
There's different sorts of
attributions we could make to

00:40:46.762 --> 00:40:50.440
people but Heider's insight is
we tend to attribute other

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:54.250
people's actions to their
personality characteristics,

00:40:54.250 --> 00:41:01.260
to long-standing aspects of
what they are.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:04.190
And this is known as a person
bias.

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:07.518
And more generally,
people tend to give too much

00:41:07.518 --> 00:41:11.910
weight to the person and not
enough weight to the situation.

00:41:15.369 --> 00:41:19.553
This is also sometimes known as
the fundamental attribution

00:41:19.553 --> 00:41:21.503
error.
The fundamental attribution

00:41:21.503 --> 00:41:24.199
error, which is one of the core
ideas in psychology,

00:41:24.199 --> 00:41:29.789
is that we tend to
over-attribute things to a

00:41:29.789 --> 00:41:37.665
person's personality or desires
or nature and not enough to the

00:41:37.665 --> 00:41:43.690
situation or the context.
There's a lot of demonstrations

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:46.335
of this.
A lot of the demonstrations

00:41:46.335 --> 00:41:49.537
have to do with intelligence so,
for example,

00:41:49.537 --> 00:41:53.613
there's actually been studies
showing that people tend to

00:41:53.613 --> 00:41:57.180
overestimate the intelligence of
professors.

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:00.594
Why?
Because I stand up here and I

00:42:00.594 --> 00:42:05.259
talk about the one or more than
one thing I know about and so

00:42:05.259 --> 00:42:09.846
it's easy to infer that I must
know a lot but in fact by the

00:42:09.846 --> 00:42:13.966
time this semester ends I will
have tell you--told you

00:42:13.966 --> 00:42:16.405
everything I know.
[laughter]

00:42:16.405 --> 00:42:19.327
And if you stood up and started
talking about everything you

00:42:19.327 --> 00:42:21.110
knew you'd look really smart
too.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:24.983
The best study to show this is
a quiz show study,

00:42:24.983 --> 00:42:29.099
which is you take two people
and you flip a coin.

00:42:29.099 --> 00:42:33.241
And one of them is the quiz
master and the quiz master gets

00:42:33.241 --> 00:42:36.739
to ask questions,
any question he or she wants.

00:42:36.739 --> 00:42:39.070
And the other person has to
answer the questions.

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:42.806
And if they play seriously,
the quiz master's going to

00:42:42.806 --> 00:42:46.520
destroy the other person.
"What was my dog's name?"

00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.558
[laughter] "Well, I don't know."
"What's the capital of the city

00:42:50.558 --> 00:42:53.119
in which I was born?"
"Well, I don't know."

00:42:53.119 --> 00:42:57.590
And then you'd expect a third
person watching this to say,

00:42:57.590 --> 00:42:59.954
"Who cares?
It's just--They're just doing

00:42:59.954 --> 00:43:01.809
this because of the coin they
flipped."

00:43:01.809 --> 00:43:04.224
But in fact,
when the person watching this

00:43:04.224 --> 00:43:07.639
has to assess their intelligence
they give the quiz asker a

00:43:07.639 --> 00:43:10.760
higher intelligence rating than
the other person.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.980
After all, "He seemed to know a
lot of answers.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.349
The other person didn't get
much right."

00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:18.579
We tend to fail to discount the
situation.

00:43:18.579 --> 00:43:22.091
If you were giving a job
talk--and this is for people in

00:43:22.091 --> 00:43:26.050
graduate school particularly--If
you were giving a job talk and

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.750
the slide projector breaks,
you're screwed.

00:43:29.750 --> 00:43:31.941
Nobody is going to say to
themselves, "Oh,

00:43:31.941 --> 00:43:35.041
well, it's not such a good talk
because the slide projector

00:43:35.041 --> 00:43:36.620
broke."
They'll say,

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.829
"It's not such a good talk
because of the person."

00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:43.279
Somebody could give a talk and
we could throw smarties at them

00:43:43.279 --> 00:43:45.487
the whole time and then you
could--then the other people

00:43:45.487 --> 00:43:47.217
would say,
"The person looked kind of

00:43:47.217 --> 00:43:49.105
upset during the whole talk.
[laughter]

00:43:49.105 --> 00:43:51.679
I wonder--They seemed like a
nervous type."

00:43:51.679 --> 00:43:54.817
[laughter]
This can be taken to extremes

00:43:54.817 --> 00:43:58.679
and the biggest extreme is the
case of actors,

00:43:58.679 --> 00:44:05.470
which is if there's ever a
case--Anybody know who this is,

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:08.193
the actor?
[laughter]

00:44:08.193 --> 00:44:12.980
Have none of you been alive in
1950?

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:18.009
[laughter] This is Robert Young.
Does anybody know the part he

00:44:18.009 --> 00:44:20.711
plays?
He played an--He played a

00:44:20.711 --> 00:44:25.417
doctor called Marcus Welby in
this famous show "Marcus Welby,

00:44:25.417 --> 00:44:29.340
M.D.," and Marcus Welby was a
wonderful doctor.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.135
He was compassionate and kind,
he made house calls,

00:44:32.135 --> 00:44:34.260
he saved lives,
he counseled people,

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:38.070
and it turned out that Robert
Young was then deluged with

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.519
mail, thousands of pieces of
mail,

00:44:40.519 --> 00:44:45.210
by people asking for his advice
on health matters.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:46.904
[laughter]
And he then,

00:44:46.904 --> 00:44:50.602
in a twist, exploited the
fundamental attribution

00:44:50.602 --> 00:44:54.917
error--people confusing the
actor for the role--exploited

00:44:54.917 --> 00:44:59.077
this by going on TV and
espousing the benefits of Sanka

00:44:59.077 --> 00:45:03.623
decaffeinated coffee where he
produced the famous line "I am

00:45:03.623 --> 00:45:07.090
not a doctor but I play one on
TV,"

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:09.055
[laughter]
whereupon people heard this and

00:45:09.055 --> 00:45:11.836
said, "Well, he must have some
authority then about medical

00:45:11.836 --> 00:45:13.439
matters."
[laughter]

00:45:13.439 --> 00:45:19.416
It turns out that the confusion
between actors and their roles

00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:22.609
is extremely common.
Many people,

00:45:22.609 --> 00:45:25.664
for instance,
view Sylvester Stallone as

00:45:25.664 --> 00:45:30.441
either an actual hero during the
Vietnam War or sort of a hero

00:45:30.441 --> 00:45:35.610
during the Vietnam War given all
his Rambo stuff but in fact,

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:40.431
of course, he played--he was in
a Swiss boarding school teaching

00:45:40.431 --> 00:45:44.869
girls age twelve through fifteen
during the Vietnam War.

00:45:44.869 --> 00:45:48.662
But it doesn't seem that way
because the role infects how we

00:45:48.662 --> 00:45:53.067
think about the person.
When this movie came out twenty

00:45:53.067 --> 00:45:57.849
years ago they needed a
character to play a gay man.

00:45:57.849 --> 00:46:00.632
According to IMDb,
where I get all my information,

00:46:00.632 --> 00:46:03.280
they hit up all the big stars,
Harrison Ford,

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.239
Michael Douglas,
and Richard Gere,

00:46:05.239 --> 00:46:08.740
and they all turned it down
because they didn't want to play

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:12.360
a gay man because people would
think that they were gay.

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.889
Finally, they got Harry Hamlin
to do it, who was kind of a

00:46:15.889 --> 00:46:18.701
B-list sort of guy.
The biggest extreme of the

00:46:18.701 --> 00:46:22.014
fundamental attribution error,
confusing the actor for his

00:46:22.014 --> 00:46:24.297
role,
is Leonard Nimoy who,

00:46:24.297 --> 00:46:27.759
because he played the
emotionless Vulcan,

00:46:27.759 --> 00:46:31.998
Spock, on Star Trek,
was then repeatedly viewed by

00:46:31.998 --> 00:46:36.960
people who saw him on the street
as if he was an actual Vulcan.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.784
[laughter]
He got sufficiently upset about

00:46:39.784 --> 00:46:43.711
this to write a book called I
Am Not Spock where he

00:46:43.711 --> 00:46:47.570
described all the ways in which
he was not a Vulcan.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:50.740
[laughter]
His career, where he attempted

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:55.418
many times to play roles that
were different from his Vulcan

00:46:55.418 --> 00:46:58.382
nature,
stalled until finally many

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:03.129
years later he gave up and wrote
another book called I Am

00:47:03.129 --> 00:47:06.991
Spock [laughter]
where he finally conceded to

00:47:06.991 --> 00:47:10.130
the fundamental attribution
error.

00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:13.405
[laughter]
If I gave this lecture ten

00:47:13.405 --> 00:47:19.138
years ago, I would say that the
fundamental attribution error is

00:47:19.138 --> 00:47:23.345
a human universal,
something that we're born with,

00:47:23.345 --> 00:47:26.050
a fundamental aspect of human
nature.

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:31.348
This is not entirely true
though and we know that through

00:47:31.348 --> 00:47:35.985
some very interesting
cross-cultural research that

00:47:35.985 --> 00:47:41.000
compares these biases across
different countries,

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:44.210
in this study between the
United States and India.

00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:46.768
And it turns out that for
whatever reason,

00:47:46.768 --> 00:47:49.825
and it would take another
course to talk about the

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:53.525
different explanations,
but people start off at,

00:47:53.525 --> 00:47:58.228
say, age eight not committing
the fundamental attribution

00:47:58.228 --> 00:48:02.657
error but in Western cultures,
where there's an ideology

00:48:02.657 --> 00:48:06.369
perhaps that people are in
charge of their own destiny,

00:48:06.369 --> 00:48:11.387
the error occurs and people
over-attribute the role to the

00:48:11.387 --> 00:48:14.079
person.
In some Eastern cultures

00:48:14.079 --> 00:48:18.670
there's more of a view about
faith and more attributions to

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:21.384
situation.
And this has been shown in many

00:48:21.384 --> 00:48:22.649
ways.
For instance,

00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:25.975
if you look at newspaper
reports about murders,

00:48:25.975 --> 00:48:29.806
in cultures like the United
States the report tends to

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:33.493
emphasize the personal
characteristics of the person

00:48:33.493 --> 00:48:37.004
accused of the murder.
In countries like India,

00:48:37.004 --> 00:48:40.070
the reports tend to emphasize,
to a greater degree,

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:44.228
the situation that the person
found himself in that might have

00:48:44.228 --> 00:48:48.296
driven him to commit a murder.
So, this is an important

00:48:48.296 --> 00:48:52.856
reminder that just because we
find something in our culture

00:48:52.856 --> 00:48:57.181
and just because it might well
be pervasive doesn't mean

00:48:57.181 --> 00:49:00.090
necessarily that it's universal.

00:49:04.369 --> 00:49:07.685
So, to summarize so far,
and we're going to look at this

00:49:07.685 --> 00:49:10.639
a little bit more for the rest
of this lecture,

00:49:10.639 --> 00:49:14.500
we've talked about two morals
in social psychology.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:19.261
One is enhancement of the self
but the other is what you can

00:49:19.261 --> 00:49:22.570
call "oversimplification of the
other."

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:27.497
So, we know ourselves that our
behavior is due to a complicated

00:49:27.497 --> 00:49:31.630
cluster of the situation and our
personal natures.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:35.016
When things go badly,
in fact, we'll blame the

00:49:35.016 --> 00:49:37.499
situation.
When things go well,

00:49:37.499 --> 00:49:42.159
the self-serving attribution
bias, we'll credit ourselves.

00:49:42.159 --> 00:49:44.900
We don't do this for other
people.

00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.409
For other people we're a lot
less forgiving.

00:49:47.409 --> 00:49:51.579
You do something stupid,
that's--you're a stupid person.

00:49:51.579 --> 00:49:55.489
I do something stupid,
it's an off day.

00:49:55.489 --> 00:49:59.546
And so, you have this
difference between how we think

00:49:59.546 --> 00:50:03.760
about ourselves and how we think
about other people.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.152
Let's talk a little bit about
what we think about other people

00:50:08.152 --> 00:50:12.039
and start by talking about why
we like other people.

00:50:12.039 --> 00:50:15.972
And here I'm going to some
extent to go over material that

00:50:15.972 --> 00:50:20.112
was raised earlier in the course
in Peter Salovey's wonderful

00:50:20.112 --> 00:50:21.937
lecture.
So, some of this,

00:50:21.937 --> 00:50:25.282
our liking of other people,
is obvious and we talked about

00:50:25.282 --> 00:50:28.556
it in Dean Salovey's lecture,
we talked about it when we

00:50:28.556 --> 00:50:30.489
talked about sexual
attractiveness.

00:50:30.489 --> 00:50:34.120
We like people who are honest,
who are kind,

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.484
who are smart,
who are funny,

00:50:36.484 --> 00:50:41.296
but study after study finds
more fundamental processes are

00:50:41.296 --> 00:50:45.940
also at work and here is a list
of three of them.

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:50.451
One is proximity.
We tend to like people who

00:50:50.451 --> 00:50:55.065
we're close to physically,
who we are physically and

00:50:55.065 --> 00:50:59.135
spatially close to,
who we spend a lot of time

00:50:59.135 --> 00:51:02.935
with.
In one study they looked at a

00:51:02.935 --> 00:51:09.026
housing project in Manhattan and
they asked people where their

00:51:09.026 --> 00:51:13.019
best friend was and 90% of them
said,

00:51:13.019 --> 00:51:17.094
"My best friend is in the same
building as me," and 50% of them

00:51:17.094 --> 00:51:20.724
says the same floor.
Ask yourself who is your best

00:51:20.724 --> 00:51:23.443
friend at Yale.
For how many of you is it

00:51:23.443 --> 00:51:27.120
somebody in your same college?
Okay.

00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:31.518
How many in a different college?
So, call it a tie but then

00:51:31.518 --> 00:51:35.640
there's a lot more colleges that
aren't yours than the one--How

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:39.230
many of you would you--say your
best friend is somebody

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.890
your--currently on your same
floor?

00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:45.280
Yeah.
If you were going to marry

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.596
somebody from this class,
it is the person you are

00:51:49.596 --> 00:51:53.217
sitting next to?
[laughter]

00:51:53.217 --> 00:52:04.320
Now, in some sense this is
an--a rather trivial finding.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.765
Of course you're going to get
more involved in people you

00:52:07.765 --> 00:52:11.090
encounter frequently.
How else is it going to work?

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:13.389
But it's actually more than
that.

00:52:13.389 --> 00:52:17.854
The more you see something the
more you like it and this is

00:52:17.854 --> 00:52:21.550
sometimes known as "the mere
exposure effect."

00:52:21.550 --> 00:52:26.547
The mere exposure effect is
simply seeing something makes it

00:52:26.547 --> 00:52:31.460
likable perhaps because it
becomes comfortable and safe.

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:35.591
In one study by James Cutting,
Cutting taught an Introduction

00:52:35.591 --> 00:52:39.930
to Psychology course and before
each lecture he'd flash pictures

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:42.463
on the screen.
He'd have a screen saver

00:52:42.463 --> 00:52:45.480
showing pictures on the screen,
paintings, and didn't say

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.619
anything about them.
People would sit down,

00:52:47.619 --> 00:52:49.500
look at them while they
prepared their notes.

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:53.208
At the end of the semester he
then asked people to rate

00:52:53.208 --> 00:52:56.780
different pictures as to how
much they liked them,

00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:01.745
and even though people had no
memory of seeing one or--versus

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:06.959
the other they tend to like the
pictures more that they had seen

00:53:06.959 --> 00:53:09.969
before.
They were somehow familiar and

00:53:09.969 --> 00:53:13.924
somehow more likable.
If I showed you a picture of

00:53:13.924 --> 00:53:19.183
yourself versus a mirror image
of yourself and asked which one

00:53:19.183 --> 00:53:23.150
you'd like more,
the answer is very strong.

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:26.774
You'd like your mirror image
more because the mirror image is

00:53:26.774 --> 00:53:29.130
what you tend to see from day to
day.

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:33.127
If I showed your best friend a
picture of you versus a mirror

00:53:33.127 --> 00:53:36.541
image picture of you,
your best friend would say he

00:53:36.541 --> 00:53:40.498
or she likes the picture more
because that corresponds to what

00:53:40.498 --> 00:53:45.588
he or she sees each day.
Familiarity is itself a desire

00:53:45.588 --> 00:53:49.150
for liking, a force for liking.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:56.679
Similarity--we like people who
are similar to us.

00:53:56.679 --> 00:54:01.140
Friends tend to be highly
similar to one another.

00:54:01.140 --> 00:54:04.566
So do husbands and wives.
Now, to some extent,

00:54:04.566 --> 00:54:08.599
similarity is hard to pull
apart from proximity.

00:54:08.599 --> 00:54:11.953
So, the fact that you are
similar to your friends at Yale

00:54:11.953 --> 00:54:15.427
might just be because you are
close to your friends at Yale

00:54:15.427 --> 00:54:18.901
and people who are at Yale tend
to be fairly similar to one

00:54:18.901 --> 00:54:21.738
another.
But there's a lot of evidence

00:54:21.738 --> 00:54:24.702
that similarity,
above and beyond proximity,

00:54:24.702 --> 00:54:28.079
has an effect on attractiveness
and on liking.

00:54:28.079 --> 00:54:32.410
Similarity predicts the success
of a marriage and through a

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:35.769
phenomena people aren't exactly
sure about,

00:54:35.769 --> 00:54:39.382
couples become more and more
similar over the course of a

00:54:39.382 --> 00:54:42.886
relationship.
Finally, people like

00:54:42.886 --> 00:54:47.040
good-looking people.
People like attractive people.

00:54:50.199 --> 00:54:54.146
Physically attractive people
are thought to be smarter,

00:54:54.146 --> 00:54:57.070
more competent,
more social and nicer.

00:54:57.070 --> 00:55:02.288
Now, some of you who are very
cynical and/or very good looking

00:55:02.288 --> 00:55:06.641
might wonder "yes,
but good-looking people like me

00:55:06.641 --> 00:55:09.708
actually are smarter,
more competent,

00:55:09.708 --> 00:55:12.690
more social and morally
better."

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:17.429
This is not a crazy response.
It is--it could be,

00:55:17.429 --> 00:55:20.341
for instance,
that the advantages of being

00:55:20.341 --> 00:55:23.750
good looking make your life run
a lot easier.

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:27.134
Teachers are more responsive to
you, people treat you better,

00:55:27.134 --> 00:55:30.800
you have more opportunities to
make your way through the world,

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:33.489
you make more money,
you have more access to things,

00:55:33.489 --> 00:55:34.860
and that could,
in turn,

00:55:34.860 --> 00:55:39.668
cause you to improve your life.
This would be what's known in

00:55:39.668 --> 00:55:43.399
the Bible as a "Matthew effect."
A Matthew effect is a

00:55:43.399 --> 00:55:46.739
developmental psychology phrase
for the sort of thing where,

00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:50.631
well, as Jesus said,
"For unto everyone that hath

00:55:50.631 --> 00:55:54.360
shall be given and he shall have
abundance."

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.951
That means if you're good
looking you'll also be smart but

00:55:58.951 --> 00:56:03.784
from him that hath not shall be
taken away even that which he

00:56:03.784 --> 00:56:07.533
hath.
It's a long version of the rich

00:56:07.533 --> 00:56:12.409
get richer and the poor even
lose what they hath.

00:56:12.409 --> 00:56:16.003
So, there's a variety of
studies suggesting that teachers

00:56:16.003 --> 00:56:19.789
rate attractive children as
smarter and higher achieving.

00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:24.923
Adults think that when an ugly
kid misbehaves it's because they

00:56:24.923 --> 00:56:29.559
have an ugly soul [laughter]
while the attractive kid,

00:56:29.559 --> 00:56:32.159
"oh, that little scamp,
somebody must have been

00:56:32.159 --> 00:56:35.536
bothering him."
When I was in the University of

00:56:35.536 --> 00:56:39.434
Arizona and we lived next--and
all I remember of my

00:56:39.434 --> 00:56:44.424
neighborhood is we lived next to
this little boy and his name was

00:56:44.424 --> 00:56:46.208
Adonis.
[laughter]

00:56:46.208 --> 00:56:48.830
Cute kid, but come on.
[laughter]

00:56:48.830 --> 00:56:52.989
Also in mock trials judges give
longer prison sentences to ugly

00:56:52.989 --> 00:56:54.271
people.
[laughter]

00:56:54.271 --> 00:56:57.693
That's the Matthew effect,
those who hath little get even

00:56:57.693 --> 00:57:00.260
that taken away and thrown into
prison.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:04.970
There is a recent study,
which I'll tell you about but I

00:57:04.970 --> 00:57:08.909
am not comfortable with it as an
experiment.

00:57:08.909 --> 00:57:14.292
The study observed people in a
shopping--in a parking lot of a

00:57:14.292 --> 00:57:19.146
supermarket and found that
parents were a lot rougher to

00:57:19.146 --> 00:57:24.264
the kids if their kids are ugly
than if their kids are good

00:57:24.264 --> 00:57:27.023
looking.
And they attribute it to the

00:57:27.023 --> 00:57:29.907
fact that, for all sorts of
reasons, the ugly kid just

00:57:29.907 --> 00:57:33.805
matters less to the parent.
I was watching a poker game

00:57:33.805 --> 00:57:38.170
once on TV and somebody who lost
said, and I quote,

00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:40.919
"They beat me like an ugly
stepchild" [laughter]

00:57:40.919 --> 00:57:43.260
and the fate of the ugly
stepchild is,

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.739
in fact, not a very good fate
but this is not a good study.

00:57:47.739 --> 00:57:50.451
For one thing,
and I don't know how to phrase

00:57:50.451 --> 00:57:52.670
this in a politically correct
way,

00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:57.206
but the parents of ugly kids
are likely to themselves be ugly

00:57:57.206 --> 00:58:00.759
people [laughter]
and maybe what they're finding

00:58:00.759 --> 00:58:04.767
is just ugly people are more
violent than good-looking

00:58:04.767 --> 00:58:06.328
people.
[laughter]

00:58:06.328 --> 00:58:09.507
This is an excellent time to
stop the lecture [laughter]

00:58:09.507 --> 00:58:12.398
so I'm going to stop the
lecture and we're going to

00:58:12.398 --> 00:58:15.000
continue social psychology on
Wednesday.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.750
Prof: Good morning all.
 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.486
Today's lecture I have called,
as you can see,

00:00:07.486 --> 00:00:12.220
"The Mother of All Forums:
Civic Architecture in Rome

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.130
Under Trajan."
 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.312
And I think you'll see what I
mean when we look both at a

00:00:17.312 --> 00:00:21.335
Trajanic bath building,
and also the Forum of Trajan in

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:23.306
Rome,
what I mean by 'Mother of all

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:23.740
Forums.'
 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.513
These were gargantuan
buildings, bigger than anything

00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:31.576
that we have seen before,
and interesting in all kinds of

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:32.229
ways.
 

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:35.170
We left off with Nerva,
with the emperor Nerva.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.475
And you'll recall that Nerva
was old, and in fact also

00:00:39.475 --> 00:00:43.700
relatively sickly,
when he became emperor of Rome.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.006
You'll also remember--and I
remind you of his portrait on

00:00:46.006 --> 00:00:47.490
the left-hand side of the
screen--

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.870
you'll also recall that he was
a member of the Senate,

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.770
and that he was chosen by the
Senate,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.070
one of their own,
to become emperor of Rome,

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.892
the first emperor to come from
the senatorial ranks in the

00:01:01.892 --> 00:01:06.391
history of Rome,
and he was very popular with

00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:07.629
the Senate.
 

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:11.060
But Nerva recognized quite
early on that,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.429
although he was popular with
the Senate and with the

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.498
aristocracy,
he was not a favorite of the

00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:22.099
army, and he realized that was
not a good position to be in,

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:25.010
and so he wisely decided,
very early on,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.476
that he would select the most
popular military man and the

00:01:29.476 --> 00:01:33.160
most highly successful military
man in Rome,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.360
a man by the name of Trajan,
as his heir.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.995
And so Nerva adopts Trajan--and
you see Trajan's portrait on the

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:45.876
right-hand side of the screen--
Nerva adopts Trajan in 97 A.D.,

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:49.488
so that in 98,
when Nerva dies--because he

00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:51.970
dies after only sixteen months
in office--

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.840
when Nerva dies,
Trajan succeeds him without

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.739
contest.
 

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:01.049
Trajan was an extraordinary
emperor for Rome.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.325
There are a number of important
points about Trajan that should

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:09.463
be made that have an impact on
our understanding and analysis

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:11.120
of his architecture.
 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.400
One of those is he's the first
Roman emperor to be born outside

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.158
of Italy.
 

00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:19.753
He was born in Spain,
the first emperor born in

00:02:19.753 --> 00:02:20.378
Spain.
 

00:02:20.378 --> 00:02:23.560
That's not to say that Spain
was the boondocks,

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.050
by any stretch of the
imagination.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.680
Spain had already been
colonized by Rome and was very

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.258
highly developed with regard to
its civilization.

00:02:31.258 --> 00:02:34.568
He also came to power as a
relatively young man.

00:02:34.568 --> 00:02:37.997
He was only 45 years of age--a
couple of years younger than

00:02:37.997 --> 00:02:41.041
Obama--
and consequently he was in--and

00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:44.038
he was in very good physical
shape,

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:47.824
and so he had the physical
wherewithal to be the kind of

00:02:47.824 --> 00:02:52.090
energetic emperor that Rome
needed at this particular point.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.919
He undertook many military
campaigns,

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.371
and very successfully,
and he was the emperor that

00:02:59.371 --> 00:03:02.258
extended Rome to its furthest
reaches,

00:03:02.258 --> 00:03:05.340
to its greatest borders,
to its most extensive borders,

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.699
during his reign.
 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.810
And actually these were borders
that were never gone beyond.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.337
After this point,
we'll see that the emperor

00:03:14.337 --> 00:03:17.220
Hadrian consolidates the extent
of the Empire,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.391
as reached by Trajan,
and no one ever takes it beyond

00:03:20.391 --> 00:03:20.818
that.
 

00:03:20.818 --> 00:03:25.235
So this is going to be the
furthest extent of the Empire

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:29.008
that we'll see in the course of
the semester.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.520
And he was also extremely wise
when it came to his choice of

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.690
the kinds of buildings that he
wanted to put up,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.414
because he followed in the
footsteps of Vespasian and

00:03:37.414 --> 00:03:40.143
Titus,
by favoring major public

00:03:40.143 --> 00:03:44.060
architecture in Rome,
and by eschewing private

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.180
architecture.
 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.879
He wanted, above all,
to disassociate himself from

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.506
Nero, and from Domitian,
who had favored palatial

00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:55.150
architecture,
as you'll recall.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.568
And so he builds public
architecture in Rome,

00:03:58.568 --> 00:04:04.235
and allies himself in this
regard to such earlier emperors

00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:10.000
as Augustus and as Claudius and
as the Flavian dynasts,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.348
and we're going to see that in
his building projects today.

00:04:13.348 --> 00:04:18.370
Like so many other emperors,
when he first came to power,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.084
he looked around to see which
buildings had fallen into

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:25.478
disrepair,
and he decided to restore as

00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:27.889
many of those as he could.
 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.959
And he chose very carefully.
 

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:33.990
Again, he obviously did not
choose buildings of Nero,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:37.319
many of which had already been
destroyed,

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.220
in any case,
but rather looked back further,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.389
in fact, dug deep into the
Republic,

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.990
a time, a simpler time in many
respects,

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:50.805
and a time prior to the
shenanigans of the monarchically

00:04:50.805 --> 00:04:56.009
minded emperors like Nero and
Domitian,

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.497
and he restored buildings from
the Republic and from the

00:04:59.497 --> 00:05:00.639
Augustan period.
 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.800
And he looked back,
for example,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.079
to the Forum of Caesar in Rome,
the Forum Iulium,

00:05:06.079 --> 00:05:09.367
which you all know well,
and we've talked about it

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:14.000
before, and I'm not going to
discuss it in any detail today.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.910
Just to remind you that it
began to be restored--

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.040
that is, the Forum of Julius
Caesar--

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.446
under Domitian,
and that that restoration was

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:24.399
completed by Trajan at some
point during his reign,

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:28.040
between 98 and 117 A.D.
 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.240
And I remind you of that here.
 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.223
You'll recall its location,
right next to the Victor

00:05:34.223 --> 00:05:36.410
Emmanuel Monument in Rome.
 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.557
You'll remember that even
though it was restored by

00:05:39.557 --> 00:05:42.769
Domitian and Trajan,
it has fallen on hard times.

00:05:42.769 --> 00:05:45.069
And if you look at the Temple
of Venus Genetrix,

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:48.831
you see that all that survives,
besides the podium and the

00:05:48.831 --> 00:05:51.738
staircase,
are three columns from that

00:05:51.738 --> 00:05:54.620
restored version,
by Trajan.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.790
You see the same three columns
over here,

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:59.310
and then you'll recall the
great open space,

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.889
with colonnades on either side,
and then the market area,

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.660
the shops or tabernae on
the left.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.074
I showed you this view as well,
pointing out one of the

00:06:11.074 --> 00:06:15.988
architectural blocks that
belonged to the restored

00:06:15.988 --> 00:06:20.000
building, the building under
Trajan.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.101
And you can see that Trajan
continues this interest in

00:06:23.101 --> 00:06:26.088
ornamentation that was
characteristic of the Flavian

00:06:26.088 --> 00:06:29.250
period: very ornamental
architectural decoration,

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.783
very deeply carved,
with a strong contrast between

00:06:32.783 --> 00:06:34.009
light and dark.
 

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.403
So he does continue this
Flavian interest in very

00:06:38.403 --> 00:06:41.790
elaborate architectural
decoration.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.449
You'll remember that the Temple
of Venus Genetrix,

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:49.894
in the Forum of Julius Caesar,
had a pediment that had in the

00:06:49.894 --> 00:06:54.487
center of that pediment a scene
depicting Venus rising from the

00:06:54.487 --> 00:06:55.079
sea.
 

00:06:55.079 --> 00:06:58.759
And there is other Venus
imagery, and I show you a

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:01.278
detail--
and it's on your Monument

00:07:01.278 --> 00:07:05.310
List--I show you a detail of
part of a frieze that depicts

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.180
cupids--
chubby, winged babies,

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.918
as you can see here,
cupids--who are carrying the

00:07:11.918 --> 00:07:15.569
arms--you can see one of them
with a sword sheath over here--

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:17.507
they are carrying the arms and
armor of Mars:

00:07:17.507 --> 00:07:19.562
Mars,
of course, the consort of

00:07:19.562 --> 00:07:23.579
Venus, and Mars making reference
also to military victory.

00:07:23.579 --> 00:07:26.240
This frieze,
as far as we can tell,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.189
does belong to the Trajanic
renovation of the building,

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:36.201
but it probably does look back
to an earlier Julian frieze that

00:07:36.201 --> 00:07:40.079
decorated the original temple in
Rome.

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:45.560
And I use that restoration of
the Temple of Venus Genetrix,

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.216
in the Forum of Julius Caesar,
as an example of the kind of

00:07:49.216 --> 00:07:51.990
restoration work that Trajan
embarked on,

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.420
at the beginning of his
principate.

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.089
But much more important to us
today are two buildings,

00:07:58.089 --> 00:08:02.600
the first a bath,
and the second a forum,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.360
that are examples of the
devotion that Trajan had to

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.000
public architecture during his
reign.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.630
And I show you a view here,
in fact, a plan of the

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:21.302
so-called Baths of Trajan in
Rome that were dedicated in A.D.

00:08:21.302 --> 00:08:22.060
109.
 

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:23.509
As you can see from the
Monument List,

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:25.389
we know the architect in this
particular case.

00:08:25.389 --> 00:08:27.730
It is Apollodorus of Damascus.
 

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.306
And his name says a lot about
him: Apollodorus from Damascus,

00:08:32.306 --> 00:08:33.450
modern Syria.
 

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:35.590
So it's very interesting.
 

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.623
We have an emperor from Spain
and an architect from Syria,

00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:41.178
who worked together.
 

00:08:41.178 --> 00:08:45.011
This is a sign that things are
beginning to change in the Roman

00:08:45.011 --> 00:08:48.597
Empire, as the Romans--as Trajan
extends those borders even

00:08:48.597 --> 00:08:49.340
further.
 

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.923
It brings in even more
multifaceted civilizations

00:08:53.923 --> 00:08:58.412
around the world,
and talent begins to pour into

00:08:58.412 --> 00:09:01.658
Rome from all of those places.
 

00:09:01.658 --> 00:09:04.259
Apollodorus of Damascus,
as we'll see today,

00:09:04.259 --> 00:09:07.952
was an extraordinary architect,
right up there with Severus and

00:09:07.952 --> 00:09:09.482
Celer,
and with Rabirius:

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:12.408
in fact, one could argue even
the equal of Rabirius.

00:09:12.408 --> 00:09:16.565
And what's particularly
interesting is that Apollodorus

00:09:16.565 --> 00:09:19.341
of Damascus,
like Severus and Celer before

00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:23.028
him, appears to have been,
above all, a great engineer.

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:29.134
He actually accompanied Trajan
on Trajan's military campaigns,

00:09:29.134 --> 00:09:33.538
and served as Trajan's military
architect.

00:09:33.538 --> 00:09:36.470
So his first commissions were
building bridges--

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.298
I'm going to show you a
reference to one today--

00:09:39.298 --> 00:09:42.812
building bridges,
or building forts and camps on

00:09:42.812 --> 00:09:48.138
Trajan's military campaigns,
and then using that expertise,

00:09:48.138 --> 00:09:52.149
ingratiating himself with the
emperor,

00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:54.700
who sees that he is enormously
talented--

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.019
because Trajan participated in
these campaigns himself--

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:02.120
seeing how talented he was,
and then putting him in charge

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.080
of his building projects in
Rome,

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.070
which is really quite
interesting.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.740
And so these projects are not
only aesthetically pleasing and

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.916
fascinating,
but also show extraordinary

00:10:13.916 --> 00:10:17.929
engineering skill on the part of
the major designer,

00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:20.690
namely Apollodorus of Damascus.
 

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.716
Now these Baths of Trajan are
very interesting in all kinds of

00:10:24.716 --> 00:10:25.178
ways.
 

00:10:25.178 --> 00:10:27.909
You can already see,
by looking at the plan,

00:10:27.909 --> 00:10:28.990
their location.
 

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:33.275
They are located on the
Esquiline Hill and part of the

00:10:33.275 --> 00:10:36.995
Oppian Hill, which I don't think
I've mentioned

00:10:36.995 --> 00:10:40.960
before--O-p-p-i-a-n,
the smaller Oppian Hill.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.928
And the Baths of Titus--well
let me remind you first that the

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:51.230
Domus Aurea of Nero was built,
in part, on the Esquiline Hill.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.047
And you'll recall the so-called
Esquiline Wing,

00:10:54.047 --> 00:10:57.476
which is the one wing of Nero's
Domus Aurea that is still

00:10:57.476 --> 00:10:59.070
preserved underground.
 

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:03.538
You'll recall that after Nero's
damnatio memoriae,

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:06.730
and the coming to power of the
Flavian dynasty,

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:10.470
that Vespasian and Titus,
and even Domitian,

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.668
razed to the ground Nero's
buildings--

00:11:14.668 --> 00:11:18.962
Vespasian did that--and then he
and Titus and Domitian built new

00:11:18.962 --> 00:11:21.009
buildings,
on top of those,

00:11:21.009 --> 00:11:24.710
and chose to make those
buildings the kind of public

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:28.700
buildings that the citizenry as
a whole would enjoy;

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:33.285
from the Colosseum and
amphitheater to the Baths of

00:11:33.285 --> 00:11:34.019
Titus.
 

00:11:34.019 --> 00:11:37.994
And you see again the Baths of
Titus here, located right again

00:11:37.994 --> 00:11:41.447
on top of this area that
originally belonged to Nero's

00:11:41.447 --> 00:11:42.490
Domus Aurea.
 

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.340
Trajan follows suit.
 

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.360
He not only is interested in
public architecture,

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.370
like Vespasian and Titus before
him,

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:52.738
but he follows their lead in
building these buildings on top

00:11:52.738 --> 00:11:57.889
of earlier structures,
now destroyed, of Nero.

00:11:57.889 --> 00:12:01.317
So it's again this same
message, giving back to the

00:12:01.317 --> 00:12:05.500
people the land that Nero had
taken illegally from Rome during

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.460
his reign.
 

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.783
The Baths of Trajan are based,
in large part,

00:12:09.783 --> 00:12:14.090
on the plan of the Baths of
Titus, with some additions.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:18.187
But you can see the
extraordinary difference in

00:12:18.187 --> 00:12:18.899
scale.
 

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:23.433
The Baths of Titus were not
small, and yet the Baths of

00:12:23.433 --> 00:12:27.297
Trajan are at least three,
if not four or more,

00:12:27.297 --> 00:12:30.740
times the size of the Baths of
Titus.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.744
So this tells us something
again about the grandiosity of

00:12:34.744 --> 00:12:38.413
the vision of Trajan,
about the funds that he had at

00:12:38.413 --> 00:12:40.592
his disposal,
and he got those funds,

00:12:40.592 --> 00:12:42.865
in large part,
because of all these military

00:12:42.865 --> 00:12:45.788
victories in which he took all
kinds of spoils and booty,

00:12:45.788 --> 00:12:49.629
which he used to fund his
building campaigns in Rome.

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:52.279
And it also tells us something
about his ambitions.

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:55.129
Now I don't want you to get the
impression that we never had big

00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:55.990
buildings before.
 

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.940
You can think back way to the
beginning of the semester when

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:01.639
we talked about Julius Caesar
and his architecture,

00:13:01.639 --> 00:13:04.509
and his bragging that he had
built a--

00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:08.139
or one of the authors of that
period tells us that Julius

00:13:08.139 --> 00:13:10.539
Caesar had built a Temple to
Mars,

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:12.110
the biggest in the world.
 

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.567
So in its own day it was,
supposedly, the biggest in the

00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:16.070
world.
 

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:19.441
But we're getting even more
ambitious vis-à-vis

00:13:19.441 --> 00:13:19.950
scale.
 

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.009
And I think--perhaps again I'm
psychoanalyzing Trajan too

00:13:24.009 --> 00:13:26.697
much--
but I think the fact that this

00:13:26.697 --> 00:13:29.860
is a man who had the ambitions
that he did,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.908
to extend the Empire to its
furthest reaches,

00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:37.556
seems to be in keeping with the
kind of man who would want to

00:13:37.556 --> 00:13:41.038
make the buildings in Rome,
that he built,

00:13:41.038 --> 00:13:45.340
a kind of microcosm of that
hugely expanded Empire.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:47.330
With regard to the plan of the
baths,

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:51.783
you will see that it follows
the so-called Imperial Bath type

00:13:51.783 --> 00:13:55.048
that was initiated by the Baths
of Titus,

00:13:55.048 --> 00:13:58.129
at least with regard to baths
that are still preserved.

00:13:58.129 --> 00:14:00.418
I mentioned to you,
when we talked about the Baths

00:14:00.418 --> 00:14:02.722
of Titus,
there may have been an earlier

00:14:02.722 --> 00:14:06.095
bath of Nero that actually
followed this same Imperial Bath

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:06.558
form.
 

00:14:06.558 --> 00:14:09.062
But we're not absolutely sure
about its plan,

00:14:09.062 --> 00:14:10.769
that is, the Neronian Baths.
 

00:14:10.769 --> 00:14:12.422
They existed,
but we're not absolutely sure

00:14:12.422 --> 00:14:13.168
about their plan.
 

00:14:13.168 --> 00:14:16.418
But if we look back at the
Baths of Titus,

00:14:16.418 --> 00:14:19.470
you'll remember that what made
them distinctive,

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:22.984
and what made them differ from
the earlier Stabian Baths or

00:14:22.984 --> 00:14:25.995
Forum Baths at Pompeii,
was the way in which they

00:14:25.995 --> 00:14:28.350
placed the bathing block in the
center,

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:33.943
rather than to the side;
that they arranged the main

00:14:33.943 --> 00:14:40.394
rooms--the tepidarium,
the frigidarium and the

00:14:40.394 --> 00:14:43.089
caldaria,
in this case--in axial

00:14:43.089 --> 00:14:45.038
relationship to one another.
 

00:14:45.038 --> 00:14:48.886
And then all the other rooms of
the bath were displayed around

00:14:48.886 --> 00:14:50.779
those, in a symmetrical way.
 

00:14:50.779 --> 00:14:56.009
So axiality and symmetry
reigned supreme.

00:14:56.009 --> 00:14:58.431
And then otherwise we saw here
the rest of the precinct,

00:14:58.431 --> 00:15:00.278
with an elaborate entranceway
over here.

00:15:00.278 --> 00:15:04.389
We see roughly the same in the
Baths of Trajan,

00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:08.690
in that again the bathing block
is located right at the center

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.287
of the structure,
and the main rooms are aligned

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:16.048
with one another axially.
 

00:15:16.048 --> 00:15:18.658
If you look up to where it says
Baths of Trajan that at the

00:15:18.658 --> 00:15:20.730
northern end is the entrance
into the baths.

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.357
You enter from there,
into N, which is a

00:15:23.357 --> 00:15:26.690
natatio or swimming pool;
a piscina.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:30.178
And then you can see that is
surrounded by columns.

00:15:30.178 --> 00:15:34.730
On axis with the swimming pool
is the frigidarium,

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.898
at F, and you can see,
just like that of the Baths of

00:15:38.898 --> 00:15:42.187
Titus,
it is a groin-vaulted room:

00:15:42.187 --> 00:15:46.332
a triple groin vaulted room,
as you can see by the three x's

00:15:46.332 --> 00:15:47.460
over the rectangular area.
 

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:52.759
It has a kind of an apse or
exedra at the uppermost part,

00:15:52.759 --> 00:15:55.908
through which one comes from
the natatio into the

00:15:55.908 --> 00:15:58.428
frigidarium,
and you can see that is

00:15:58.428 --> 00:15:59.580
screened by columns.
 

00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:01.700
Then from there into the fairly
simple,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.538
rectangularly shaped
tepidarium,

00:16:04.538 --> 00:16:07.631
that serves more as a kind of
passageway from the

00:16:07.631 --> 00:16:10.874
frigidarium,
into C, which of course is the

00:16:10.874 --> 00:16:13.606
caldarium,
or the warmest room,

00:16:13.606 --> 00:16:15.500
the sauna of the baths.
 

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:19.365
That also has a rectangular
shape, but with these radiating

00:16:19.365 --> 00:16:23.500
alcoves, radiating alcoves that
we're going to see are screened

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:24.500
by columns.
 

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.601
And they are,
of course, facing the southern

00:16:27.601 --> 00:16:30.197
end where the sun is,
and that would,

00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:34.308
of course, help to heat the
caldarium as well.

00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:37.683
And then what we see though
with regard to the Baths of

00:16:37.683 --> 00:16:40.378
Trajan,
that make them differ from the

00:16:40.378 --> 00:16:43.542
Baths of Titus,
and are part of this evolution

00:16:43.542 --> 00:16:46.200
of Imperial Bath architecture in
Rome,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.659
is the fact that the bathing
block is placed in this very

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:52.970
large rectangular precinct.
 

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.836
And this large rectangular
precinct has a series of rooms

00:16:56.836 --> 00:17:00.772
around it, as you can see,
real rooms, and rooms that take

00:17:00.772 --> 00:17:02.428
all kinds of shapes.
 

00:17:02.428 --> 00:17:07.130
Many of them are these
hemicycle type shapes,

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:13.358
screened with columns from the
larger central space,

00:17:13.358 --> 00:17:16.977
but some of them also look like
the tabernae that we've

00:17:16.977 --> 00:17:18.460
become used to in plan.
 

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.680
We see all of those there,
and these were used,

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.759
as far as we can determine,
as meeting halls,

00:17:24.759 --> 00:17:27.910
lecture halls,
Greek and Latin libraries.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.068
So there's this extension of
the bath,

00:17:31.068 --> 00:17:35.354
from being just a place where
you went for wellness

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:39.400
essentially,
to bathe and to relax and to

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.640
have social interaction with
your friends.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:48.868
They are adding an intellectual
element to the bath buildings,

00:17:48.868 --> 00:17:51.618
so that you can also go there
if you want to read--

00:17:51.618 --> 00:17:53.700
if you want to go to the
library and read Greek books,

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:56.430
read Latin books--go to
lectures, go to seminars,

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:59.608
have conversations,
intellectual conversations,

00:17:59.608 --> 00:18:03.038
are also beginning to happen
here.

00:18:03.038 --> 00:18:06.051
So the bath becomes even more
of a mecca for people who are

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:12.009
interested in intellectual life,
as well as bathing and social

00:18:12.009 --> 00:18:14.064
life,
which is a very important

00:18:14.064 --> 00:18:15.710
development culturally for the
Romans.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:18.368
Note here also this great
hemicycle,

00:18:18.368 --> 00:18:21.720
down here, which is part of the
bath building --

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.143
a hemicycle that had seats on
it, which probably served for

00:18:26.143 --> 00:18:30.532
performances of whatever kind,
that would have taken place

00:18:30.532 --> 00:18:30.950
here.
 

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.650
So that's another interesting
addition to the bathing scene,

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.978
and should you remind you of
the kind of hemicycles that we

00:18:37.978 --> 00:18:39.186
saw,
for example,

00:18:39.186 --> 00:18:42.890
in the Sanctuary of Fortuna
Primigenia at Palestrina,

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.640
or the Sanctuary of Hercules at
Tivoli,

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.519
where they also had those
performance areas.

00:18:48.519 --> 00:18:55.067
So bringing in some of those
elements from sanctuary design,

00:18:55.067 --> 00:19:00.730
into bath design,
in the Baths of Trajan in Rome.

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.400
The Baths of Trajan,
some parts of them still exist,

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:08.060
but scattered,
and in fact they are located

00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.809
now in a kind of a pleasant
garden area,

00:19:11.809 --> 00:19:13.048
as you can see here.
 

00:19:13.048 --> 00:19:17.332
This is a Google Earth view
that shows you their proximity

00:19:17.332 --> 00:19:19.721
to the Colosseum;
we see the edge of the

00:19:19.721 --> 00:19:20.640
Colosseum over here.
 

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.400
So the Esquiline Hill,
in large part.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.970
And you can just barely make
out here--

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:28.258
if you look,
see this curved wall,

00:19:28.258 --> 00:19:30.865
down here,
that curved wall is in fact

00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:34.156
that hemicycle with the--
for the theatrical performances

00:19:34.156 --> 00:19:36.900
that I showed you,
just before.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:40.015
And that is actually the
entrance -- for anyone going to

00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:42.676
Rome over break,
that's actually the entrance to

00:19:42.676 --> 00:19:43.808
the Domus Aurea.
 

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.570
If it's open--it periodically
closes, sometimes,

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.156
if things are falling down--but
if it's open,

00:19:49.156 --> 00:19:50.920
that's how one gets there.
 

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.940
And over here you can actually
see this is the--

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:56.130
I may have shown this to you
before--

00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:00.338
but this is actually the
oculus of the octagonal

00:20:00.338 --> 00:20:02.598
room of Nero's Domus Aurea.
 

00:20:02.598 --> 00:20:04.382
You can see it,
if you wander through this

00:20:04.382 --> 00:20:06.337
park,
you can see it from above,

00:20:06.337 --> 00:20:09.490
with a grate on top of it,
as well as down below,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.558
if you visit the palace itself.
 

00:20:11.558 --> 00:20:13.798
And then up here,
you can see another--

00:20:13.798 --> 00:20:16.900
just right up above my
finger--you can see another

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.516
curved wall,
and there's another one

00:20:19.516 --> 00:20:24.707
somewhere down here,
that are part of those curved

00:20:24.707 --> 00:20:28.730
rooms,
those hemicycle-shaped rooms,

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:34.788
that are these lecture halls
and meeting halls and so on.

00:20:34.788 --> 00:20:37.650
And actually that one,
the one that's up here,

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:42.868
actually has niches in the
wall, with shelves,

00:20:42.868 --> 00:20:46.750
which indicates to us that that
was used as one of the

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.630
libraries.
 

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:50.353
The scrolls would have been
placed on those shelves,

00:20:50.353 --> 00:20:52.650
and then have cupboards in
front of them.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:56.204
So one can see remains--it's
made out of concrete,

00:20:56.204 --> 00:21:00.848
faced with brick--one can see
remains on the top of that hill.

00:21:00.848 --> 00:21:03.983
But a model over here gives you
a better sense of what it looked

00:21:03.983 --> 00:21:04.980
like in antiquity.
 

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:08.160
We're again looking at that
large hemicycle that served,

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.108
with its seats that served for
performances here.

00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:13.528
We're looking at the outer
precinct wall.

00:21:13.528 --> 00:21:17.180
We can see the semi-domes of
some of the hemicycles here.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.470
And we can also see the bathing
block;

00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:23.230
at the uppermost part,
the entranceway;

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.377
the courtyard,
surrounded by columns,

00:21:25.377 --> 00:21:28.720
which is where the pool or
natatio was located.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:32.880
The covered area here was the
frigidarium;

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.348
then the tepidarium.
 

00:21:34.348 --> 00:21:36.709
The caldarium is here,
and here you can see those

00:21:36.709 --> 00:21:38.682
radiating alcoves,
with columns,

00:21:38.682 --> 00:21:42.480
that opened them up for vistas
and the like,

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.308
as well as to the warmth of the
sun.

00:21:45.308 --> 00:21:49.400
So an incredible bathing
establishment,

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:53.688
and one that has taken us a
step further in the evolution of

00:21:53.688 --> 00:21:56.450
imperial bath architecture in
Rome,

00:21:56.450 --> 00:22:01.065
and will serve as the major
model for the two most famous

00:22:01.065 --> 00:22:04.608
and much better preserved baths
in Rome,

00:22:04.608 --> 00:22:07.125
and that is the Baths of
Caracalla and the Baths of

00:22:07.125 --> 00:22:09.823
Diocletian,
which we'll look at later in

00:22:09.823 --> 00:22:10.818
the semester.
 

00:22:10.818 --> 00:22:15.406
But I'd like to turn from the
Trajanic baths to unquestionably

00:22:15.406 --> 00:22:19.542
the most important public
building that was commissioned

00:22:19.542 --> 00:22:23.654
by Trajan during his reign,
and I can't overemphasize

00:22:23.654 --> 00:22:27.817
enough the importance of this
building in the history of Roman

00:22:27.817 --> 00:22:28.910
architecture.
 

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:33.394
And we're going to see that it
is two part, in the sense that

00:22:33.394 --> 00:22:36.835
it has--it is a forum,
it has the forum proper,

00:22:36.835 --> 00:22:40.048
and it also has markets
appended to it.

00:22:40.048 --> 00:22:42.058
They are done in a different
architectural style,

00:22:42.058 --> 00:22:43.650
and herald something very
important;

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:48.410
a very important development in
Roman architecture that's going

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:52.019
to be carried further by
Trajan's successors.

00:22:52.019 --> 00:22:56.595
What we're looking at here is a
spectacular aerial view of the

00:22:56.595 --> 00:23:00.868
part of Rome in which the Forum
of Trajan finds itself.

00:23:00.868 --> 00:23:05.079
We are looking at buildings
that we have looked at before;

00:23:05.079 --> 00:23:06.750
so we can get our bearings.
 

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:09.590
This is, of course,
the wedding cake of Victor

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.980
Emmanuel, over here.
 

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:14.817
You can see a part of the oval
piazza, designed by

00:23:14.817 --> 00:23:17.558
Michelangelo,
of the Campidoglio.

00:23:17.558 --> 00:23:22.579
You can also see--what's this,
down here?

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.569
Forum?
 

00:23:26.569 --> 00:23:28.410
Student:  The Julian.
 

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:31.701
Prof: The Julian Forum,
the Forum of Julius Caesar,

00:23:31.701 --> 00:23:35.048
much lower ground level than
the rest of the city today.

00:23:35.048 --> 00:23:37.288
And you can actually see those
three columns,

00:23:37.288 --> 00:23:39.630
from the temple,
that I showed you just before,

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.430
as well as the tabernae
of the Julian Forum.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:47.035
And note the relationship of
the Julian Forum to the Trajanic

00:23:47.035 --> 00:23:47.650
Forum.
 

00:23:47.650 --> 00:23:50.286
He's restoring Julius Caesar's
Forum, at the same time he's

00:23:50.286 --> 00:23:51.150
building his own.
 

00:23:51.150 --> 00:23:56.511
I can also show you here--if
you look right above my hand you

00:23:56.511 --> 00:24:01.250
can see the Piazza Venezia and
the Palazzo Venezia.

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.397
If you look at the center of
that building,

00:24:03.397 --> 00:24:05.650
right over the doorway,
there's a balcony.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:08.548
That is the famous Mussolini
balcony;

00:24:08.548 --> 00:24:12.295
that's the balcony from which
Mussolini made all his speeches,

00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:15.548
with his followers gathering in
the Piazza Venezia.

00:24:15.548 --> 00:24:18.278
And from that,
from the Piazza Venezia,

00:24:18.278 --> 00:24:22.338
the street that goes from there
to the Piazza del Popolo,

00:24:22.338 --> 00:24:24.585
is the Corso,
the racecourse,

00:24:24.585 --> 00:24:27.606
the Corso of Rome,
which is one of the major

00:24:27.606 --> 00:24:29.307
streets of Rome,
one of the major shopping

00:24:29.307 --> 00:24:30.849
streets of Rome,
as well as one of the major

00:24:30.849 --> 00:24:33.338
thoroughfares,
that takes you--if you go down

00:24:33.338 --> 00:24:34.827
halfway,
take a right,

00:24:34.827 --> 00:24:39.189
you are at the Via Condotti,
and ultimately at the Piazza di

00:24:39.189 --> 00:24:41.221
Spagna,
or the Spanish Steps,

00:24:41.221 --> 00:24:44.733
which of course is a trek that
everybody who visits Rome

00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:48.220
follows that path,
to see the Spanish Steps.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:52.895
Over here, the forum that we're
going to be talking about today,

00:24:52.895 --> 00:24:54.529
the Forum of Trajan.
 

00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:58.317
Much of that forum is
underground, and some of it was

00:24:58.317 --> 00:25:01.303
turned into a garden,
as you can see here:

00:25:01.303 --> 00:25:04.288
a pleasant park,
as you can see here.

00:25:04.288 --> 00:25:08.036
Here we are looking at some of
the columns from the Basilica

00:25:08.036 --> 00:25:11.465
that's part of that forum,
from the very well-preserved

00:25:11.465 --> 00:25:12.798
Column of Trajan.
 

00:25:12.798 --> 00:25:17.940
And also over here we'll see
the markets of the forum.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.013
But I just wanted you to get
your bearings again in terms of

00:25:21.013 --> 00:25:24.510
where it's situated in Rome,
and what it looks like today

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.614
from the air,
although it is changing all the

00:25:27.614 --> 00:25:28.019
time.
 

00:25:28.019 --> 00:25:30.446
And I wanted to show you a
Google Earth image as well,

00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:33.333
because this is much more up to
date than the aerial view that I

00:25:33.333 --> 00:25:34.568
showed you just before.
 

00:25:34.568 --> 00:25:37.618
And you'll see the same
buildings.

00:25:37.618 --> 00:25:40.385
You'll see the Victor Emmanuel
Monument, and you'll see part of

00:25:40.385 --> 00:25:41.190
the Campidoglio.
 

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:44.853
You'll see the Mussolini
balcony and the Corso,

00:25:44.853 --> 00:25:48.913
and you'll see the Column of
Trajan, and part of the

00:25:48.913 --> 00:25:49.950
Basilica.
 

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:54.482
But what you see here is that
park has been replaced by

00:25:54.482 --> 00:25:58.009
structures, because they are
excavating.

00:25:58.009 --> 00:26:01.516
I've mentioned this before,
they are excavating more of

00:26:01.516 --> 00:26:04.957
this now, with the hope of
someday rejoining the Roman

00:26:04.957 --> 00:26:07.098
Forum with the Imperial Fora.
 

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:10.238
That may not be able to happen,
because of traffic concerns,

00:26:10.238 --> 00:26:13.430
but it is certainly something
that's on the drawing board.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.497
And at the very least,
right now, without narrowing

00:26:16.497 --> 00:26:19.134
the street, the main Via dei
Fori Imperiali,

00:26:19.134 --> 00:26:22.078
they are doing excavation in
that park area.

00:26:22.078 --> 00:26:24.200
And you can see what they've
brought up.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.317
This is not ancient,
it's actually mostly Medieval

00:26:27.317 --> 00:26:27.890
houses.
 

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:30.700
I hope--I felt there are no
Medievalists among you--

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.798
but I hope they'll eventually
realize that these are--

00:26:32.798 --> 00:26:37.268
well, who's to say?--that they
should probably remove these as

00:26:37.268 --> 00:26:41.369
well and take us back to the
original Forum of Trajan;

00:26:41.369 --> 00:26:43.079
I hope that happens someday.
 

00:26:43.079 --> 00:26:43.769
They're not very distinctive.
 

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:46.039
If one looks at them,
they're just mainly rectangular

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:46.390
rooms.
 

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.944
But nonetheless they're at that
Medieval level now,

00:26:48.944 --> 00:26:51.756
and the question is whether
they're going to go down any

00:26:51.756 --> 00:26:52.368
further.
 

00:26:52.368 --> 00:26:54.886
But here you can see,
not only the remains of the

00:26:54.886 --> 00:26:57.509
Forum of Trajan,
but also the Forum of Augustus.

00:26:57.509 --> 00:27:01.102
Here's the Temple of Mars Ultor
-- that great precinct wall that

00:27:01.102 --> 00:27:03.838
divided it from the Subura,
also visible here.

00:27:03.838 --> 00:27:07.928
And here we see the great
hemicycle that we'll look at

00:27:07.928 --> 00:27:11.631
today of Trajan's Forum,
behind it the Markets of

00:27:11.631 --> 00:27:12.480
Trajan.
 

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.465
It's important for us to look
back at the general plan of the

00:27:16.465 --> 00:27:19.057
Imperial Fora,
to see where the Forum of

00:27:19.057 --> 00:27:20.318
Trajan fits in.
 

00:27:20.318 --> 00:27:23.628
We have already looked at the
Forum of Julius Caesar,

00:27:23.628 --> 00:27:25.920
with its Temple of Venus
Genetrix.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.827
We have looked at the Forum of
Augustus, with its Temple of

00:27:28.827 --> 00:27:29.480
Mars Ultor.
 

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.098
Remember the exedrae on either
side of that temple,

00:27:32.098 --> 00:27:35.558
the embracing arms,
that were new at that time,

00:27:35.558 --> 00:27:38.450
and an important component of
the Forum of Augustus.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.848
Vespasian adds his Forum Pacis
over here.

00:27:41.848 --> 00:27:46.182
Domitian adds a narrow forum,
the so-called Forum

00:27:46.182 --> 00:27:51.328
Transitorium that served as a
point of transit between the

00:27:51.328 --> 00:27:54.578
Roman Forum and the Subura here.
 

00:27:54.578 --> 00:27:59.951
He puts a temple to his patron
goddess, Minerva,

00:27:59.951 --> 00:28:01.778
in that forum.
 

00:28:01.778 --> 00:28:06.265
But it is, at his death,
it is taken over by Nerva and

00:28:06.265 --> 00:28:08.720
renamed the Forum of Nerva.
 

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.061
I mentioned to you,
when we talked about the Forum

00:28:12.061 --> 00:28:14.994
Transitorium,
that Domitian also had his eye

00:28:14.994 --> 00:28:17.108
on this property over here.
 

00:28:17.108 --> 00:28:22.470
He had schemes as grandiose for
public architecture,

00:28:22.470 --> 00:28:26.009
at one point,
as for palatial architecture,

00:28:26.009 --> 00:28:28.556
but palatial architecture won
out and he put all of his effort

00:28:28.556 --> 00:28:30.733
into the palace,
on the Palatine Hill,

00:28:30.733 --> 00:28:34.029
and never realized any
construction in this area.

00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:38.093
When Trajan became emperor,
he decided that he would again

00:28:38.093 --> 00:28:42.371
focus on public architecture,
and that he would build a forum

00:28:42.371 --> 00:28:44.509
like none other before it.
 

00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:48.009
And so he begins to do that.
 

00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:51.236
Now that was no small feat in
this particular part of the

00:28:51.236 --> 00:28:54.519
city, because most of this area
was occupied by a hill;

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:58.779
the so-called
Quirinal--Q-u-i-r-i-n-a-l--the

00:28:58.779 --> 00:29:03.138
Quirinal Hill,
in Rome, occupied most of this

00:29:03.138 --> 00:29:04.130
space.
 

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:07.536
So what he needed to do--it's
great to have an architect

00:29:07.536 --> 00:29:10.818
engineer in your back pocket,
so he set Apollodorus of

00:29:10.818 --> 00:29:12.118
Damascus to work.
 

00:29:12.118 --> 00:29:15.009
He said: "You're a great
engineer.

00:29:15.009 --> 00:29:17.646
All you need to do is take down
a good part of the Quirinal

00:29:17.646 --> 00:29:20.011
Hill, to make way for this great
forum that I want to

00:29:20.011 --> 00:29:20.740
build."
 

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.974
And lo and behold,
Apollodorus was absolutely up

00:29:23.974 --> 00:29:27.828
to the job, and that's exactly
what he sets out to do.

00:29:27.828 --> 00:29:32.721
He removes 125 feet of the
Quirinal Hill,

00:29:32.721 --> 00:29:38.470
in order to make way for the
Forum of Trajan.

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:42.096
And that very number,
125 feet, is actually

00:29:42.096 --> 00:29:45.548
commemorated in the Column of
Trajan,

00:29:45.548 --> 00:29:48.401
because the Column of Trajan
was built to that very same

00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:50.260
height,
125 feet, to show you,

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:54.613
as you stand in the forum,
how much of that hill had to be

00:29:54.613 --> 00:29:58.450
cut back in order to make way
for the forum.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:02.231
You can see by looking at this
plan of the Imperial Fora as a

00:30:02.231 --> 00:30:04.001
whole--
and this is--not only did

00:30:04.001 --> 00:30:06.308
Trajan take the Empire to its
furthest extent,

00:30:06.308 --> 00:30:11.299
this is the last forum that was
added to the Imperial Fora,

00:30:11.299 --> 00:30:12.568
in Rome.
 

00:30:12.568 --> 00:30:15.082
You can see,
by looking at it in connection

00:30:15.082 --> 00:30:17.558
to the others,
that if you count it,

00:30:17.558 --> 00:30:20.625
plus the markets--
which you see wending their way

00:30:20.625 --> 00:30:23.608
up what was left of the Quirinal
Hill here in plan--

00:30:23.608 --> 00:30:27.522
if you compare that to the
others, you can see that the

00:30:27.522 --> 00:30:30.511
Forum of Trajan,
and the Markets of Trajan,

00:30:30.511 --> 00:30:33.490
were almost as large as all of
the other fora--

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:36.311
not counting the Roman
Forum--but all of the other

00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:39.768
Imperial Fora together,
which gives you some sense of

00:30:39.768 --> 00:30:43.548
why I called this "The
Mother of All Forums."

00:30:43.548 --> 00:30:45.703
Now we're going to look at the
plan of this,

00:30:45.703 --> 00:30:48.660
and I'm going to show you an
individual plan in a moment.

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:51.125
But what I want to say,
while this is still on the

00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:53.877
screen,
is that I want you to look at

00:30:53.877 --> 00:30:58.453
the exedrae that you see on
either side of the main space of

00:30:58.453 --> 00:31:00.772
the forum,
and on either side of the

00:31:00.772 --> 00:31:01.759
basilica over here.
 

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:04.098
These are not coincidental.
 

00:31:04.098 --> 00:31:08.230
They are certainly meant to
make reference to the exedrae of

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.490
Augustus' forum.
 

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.690
Trajan modeled himself after
Augustus.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.078
He became a kind of
neo-Augustus.

00:31:14.078 --> 00:31:17.335
He took on Augustus' hairstyle
and his manners,

00:31:17.335 --> 00:31:20.236
and so he was trying to
associate himself,

00:31:20.236 --> 00:31:22.430
in his life,
with Augustus.

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.772
He's doing it here also,
through architecture,

00:31:25.772 --> 00:31:29.858
by placing those exedrae on
either side of his forum.

00:31:29.858 --> 00:31:34.419
Here's a plan of the forum
itself, on the left-hand side of

00:31:34.419 --> 00:31:38.900
the screen, where we can see all
of its major features.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.390
You'd enter into the forum down
here.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:45.680
There was a very elaborate
entranceway, here.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.574
And you can see that the
façade is actually not

00:31:48.574 --> 00:31:50.909
straight,
but convex, convex:

00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:54.222
a convex façade,
which is very interesting,

00:31:54.222 --> 00:31:57.824
curved façade,
with an elaborate entranceway

00:31:57.824 --> 00:31:58.818
over here.
 

00:31:58.818 --> 00:32:02.568
The entrance into the main part
of the forum,

00:32:02.568 --> 00:32:04.528
rectangular in shape.
 

00:32:04.528 --> 00:32:08.019
There's a base here for an
equestrian statue of Trajan.

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:11.944
The exedrae on either side,
mimicking those of the Forum of

00:32:11.944 --> 00:32:12.690
Augustus.
 

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.722
Colonnades, also on either
side, and some additional

00:32:16.722 --> 00:32:17.910
columns here.
 

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:21.078
And we're going to see that
just as in Augustus' forum--

00:32:21.078 --> 00:32:22.960
another reference back to
Augustus--

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:27.670
that the columns in this main
area are Corinthian below,

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:29.950
but in the second tier there
are figures --

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:33.250
not figures of caryatids,
but different kinds of figures,

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:35.279
and I'm going to show you those
soon.

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:40.502
Over here the basilica,
which is perpendicular to the

00:32:40.502 --> 00:32:42.009
forum proper.
 

00:32:42.009 --> 00:32:44.566
This is quite different from
the Forum at Pompeii,

00:32:44.566 --> 00:32:47.174
where you'll remember the
basilica was splayed off,

00:32:47.174 --> 00:32:48.009
to the side.
 

00:32:48.009 --> 00:32:50.598
Here we have it as a more
integral part of the forum,

00:32:50.598 --> 00:32:52.740
and perpendicular to the main
space here.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:55.038
It's a very large basilica.
 

00:32:55.038 --> 00:32:57.690
It takes the name of Trajan's
family.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:01.680
His family name was Ulpius,
U-l-p-i-u-s.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.702
This is the Basilica Ulpia in
Rome, with a central nave,

00:33:05.702 --> 00:33:09.067
and side aisles,
a couple of side aisles around

00:33:09.067 --> 00:33:09.578
it.
 

00:33:09.578 --> 00:33:14.211
So a veritable forest of
columns, and then other exedrae,

00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:17.023
matching exedrae,
or, in this case,

00:33:17.023 --> 00:33:19.009
apses on either end.
 

00:33:19.009 --> 00:33:22.875
Then through here you see the
location of the Column of

00:33:22.875 --> 00:33:26.314
Trajan, in a small piazza,
and to left and right,

00:33:26.314 --> 00:33:29.250
libraries, Greek and Latin
libraries.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:31.328
And then at the end, a temple.
 

00:33:31.328 --> 00:33:34.108
We don't know what Trajan
actually--

00:33:34.108 --> 00:33:39.311
the northern end of the
structure was not completed at

00:33:39.311 --> 00:33:42.647
Trajan's death,
and we don't know if he would

00:33:42.647 --> 00:33:44.000
have put a temple there.
 

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.151
It's highly likely,
because what forum have we

00:33:46.151 --> 00:33:48.160
seen, without a temple at the
short end?

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.328
They all had them.
 

00:33:49.328 --> 00:33:52.588
So it's a good guess that
Trajan had that in mind too.

00:33:52.588 --> 00:33:55.194
But the temple that was built
there was actually built after

00:33:55.194 --> 00:33:56.948
his death,
by his successor,

00:33:56.948 --> 00:34:00.828
Hadrian: a temple that Hadrian
put up to honor Trajan,

00:34:00.828 --> 00:34:05.549
and also Trajan's wife,
Plotina, P-l-o-t-i-n-a.

00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:06.868
Now we know quite a bit.
 

00:34:06.868 --> 00:34:08.585
A lot of the forum,
some of the forum,

00:34:08.585 --> 00:34:10.860
is still preserved,
and we have evidence for other

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.670
parts of it that are not
preserved.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:14.579
This entrance gate, down here.
 

00:34:14.579 --> 00:34:17.532
Believe it or not,
we have coins that have an

00:34:17.532 --> 00:34:20.451
entrance gate on them,
and nicely they

00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:25.110
say--fortunately they say,
down below, FORVMTRAIAN,

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:26.768
Forum of Trajan.
 

00:34:26.768 --> 00:34:29.802
So putting two and two
together, we have to go on the

00:34:29.802 --> 00:34:33.420
assumption that what we are
looking at here is a rendition,

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.769
on a coin, of the entrance gate
into the Forum of Trajan,

00:34:37.769 --> 00:34:39.210
FORVMTRAIAN.
 

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.409
And if we look at it here,
we see some interesting things.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:46.369
We see, first of all,
that it has a single arcuation

00:34:46.369 --> 00:34:49.010
in the center -- so one doorway.
 

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.739
It has a series of bays,
that have in them what we call

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:54.608
aediculae,
a-e-d-i-c-u-l-a-e,

00:34:54.608 --> 00:34:58.860
aediculae,
which are little temple fronts

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.764
that are--
niches with little temple

00:35:00.764 --> 00:35:02.980
fronts around them,
with columns and pediments.

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.460
And then you can see statuary,
inside those.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.364
So a series of bays,
decorated with these

00:35:08.364 --> 00:35:09.889
aediculae with statues.
 

00:35:09.889 --> 00:35:15.010
Then a series of circles with
blobs in them.

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:17.666
I think those series of circles
with blobs in them are probably

00:35:17.666 --> 00:35:19.210
portraits represented on
shields,

00:35:19.210 --> 00:35:23.304
because we have remains of
actual portraits on shields from

00:35:23.304 --> 00:35:25.139
the inside of the forum.
 

00:35:25.139 --> 00:35:27.440
So that seems to be the case
here as well.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:32.003
And then in the uppermost part,
we see that the gate looks very

00:35:32.003 --> 00:35:35.264
much like an arch,
in the sense that it supports a

00:35:35.264 --> 00:35:37.389
quadriga,
at the top, and that

00:35:37.389 --> 00:35:39.650
quadriga represents two
people,

00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:42.730
possibly the emperor--again,
we're dealing with blobs here;

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:44.250
we have to do the best we can
to interpret them--

00:35:44.250 --> 00:35:47.760
but they seem to be probably
the emperor,

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.768
and possibly Victory crowning
him, the way we saw Victory

00:35:50.768 --> 00:35:53.699
crowing Titus in his chariot,
on his arch.

00:35:53.699 --> 00:35:57.498
Six horses in this particular
case, and then on either side

00:35:57.498 --> 00:36:01.364
trophies, these tree trunks
decorated with captured arms and

00:36:01.364 --> 00:36:02.018
armor.
 

00:36:02.018 --> 00:36:05.893
And we're not absolutely sure
what's surrounding them in this

00:36:05.893 --> 00:36:09.250
case, whether they're prisoners
or Roman soldiers.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:13.550
So this gives you a very good
idea of the entrance gate into

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:14.789
this structure.
 

00:36:14.789 --> 00:36:17.842
And I also want to point out,
if you look very closely at the

00:36:17.842 --> 00:36:20.489
columns and the elements above
them in the attic,

00:36:20.489 --> 00:36:22.300
you can see that the columns
project,

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.670
and the attic seems to have
projecting entablatures.

00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:29.329
So it looks as if we have the
kind of scheme here that we saw

00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:32.894
in the Forum Transitorium,
with that wall decorated with

00:36:32.894 --> 00:36:35.309
columns that project out of the
wall,

00:36:35.309 --> 00:36:37.480
and that have projecting
entablature,

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:40.632
giving this
undulation--undulating movement

00:36:40.632 --> 00:36:44.592
from projecting to receding,
projecting to receding,

00:36:44.592 --> 00:36:47.929
across the façade of the
entrance gate.

00:36:47.929 --> 00:36:53.280
The figures that were located
on the upper tier of the

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:57.315
center--
of the main body of this forum

00:36:57.315 --> 00:37:00.983
again were not caryatids,
or female figures,

00:37:00.983 --> 00:37:03.500
but rather male figures:
male figures of captured

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:06.568
Dacians,
because the war that Trajan

00:37:06.568 --> 00:37:11.085
had, that enabled him to
celebrate and to fund this

00:37:11.085 --> 00:37:14.619
building,
was his wars against the

00:37:14.619 --> 00:37:16.980
Dacians, D-a-c-i-a-n-s.
 

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:21.010
Dacia, ancient Dacia,
modern Romania today.

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.346
Trajan had two military
campaigns there,

00:37:24.346 --> 00:37:29.480
one from 102 to--excuse me,
the first one from 101 to 102;

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.909
the second one from 105 to 107.
 

00:37:32.909 --> 00:37:37.914
He was victorious in both of
those, and this forum was built

00:37:37.914 --> 00:37:42.751
from the spoils of that war,
to honor his victory over the

00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:43.768
Dacians.
 

00:37:43.768 --> 00:37:47.382
And we see therefore that the
figures that are in the

00:37:47.382 --> 00:37:50.510
uppermost tier,
of the main body of the forum,

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.219
are depictions of captured
Dacians;

00:37:53.219 --> 00:37:56.559
of Dacian prisoners brought
back to Rome.

00:37:56.559 --> 00:37:58.130
You see two of them here.
 

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:01.202
Here a headless figure,
here a much more complete

00:38:01.202 --> 00:38:01.780
figure.
 

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.777
The headless figure still can
be seen on the site,

00:38:04.777 --> 00:38:08.266
and the one on the left-hand
side of the screen now in the

00:38:08.266 --> 00:38:09.980
Vatican Museums in Rome.
 

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:12.422
The one on the left gives you a
better sense of what these

00:38:12.422 --> 00:38:13.579
looked like in antiquity.
 

00:38:13.579 --> 00:38:15.010
You can tell that these are not
Romans;

00:38:15.010 --> 00:38:18.856
wearing leggings,
a tunic, a fringed mantle,

00:38:18.856 --> 00:38:23.690
that the Romans did not wear,
a long fringed mantle.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.860
And then above you see that he
has,

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:31.230
unlike Trajan's closely cropped
Augustan-type hairstyle,

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:35.199
you can see he has very long
hair, and also a beard,

00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:37.869
and this identifies him as a
very different--

00:38:37.869 --> 00:38:42.329
sort of boots that seem to be
made out of suede or felt of

00:38:42.329 --> 00:38:43.268
some sort.
 

00:38:43.268 --> 00:38:45.409
So a very different kind of
image.

00:38:45.409 --> 00:38:48.958
Clearly these are again the
Dacian prisoners,

00:38:48.958 --> 00:38:52.750
one after another,
aligning that second tier.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:56.010
And for any of you interested
in the fact that the Romans made

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.989
nearly exact duplicates of
things,

00:38:57.989 --> 00:39:01.159
mechanical copies,
you can see in this particular

00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:03.315
statue--
we rarely have this preserved,

00:39:03.315 --> 00:39:05.760
so it's an interesting example
of these points--

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.309
you see these little excess
pieces of marble.

00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:12.396
The Romans had created a kind
of pointing machine,

00:39:12.396 --> 00:39:16.900
which they used to make exact
replicas of originals.

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.541
And they usually,
when the statue was done,

00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:22.307
they would usually obviously
take these away,

00:39:22.307 --> 00:39:24.949
carve them away,
which they didn't do.

00:39:24.949 --> 00:39:28.039
This one probably was not used,
for some reason;

00:39:28.039 --> 00:39:31.998
it was copied and never put up
on the building,

00:39:31.998 --> 00:39:35.010
and so those points still
remain.

00:39:35.010 --> 00:39:37.385
This is a model of the Forum of
Trajan, as it would have looked

00:39:37.385 --> 00:39:39.110
in antiquity,
with that convex entranceway;

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:42.889
the location of the equestrian
statue, the exedrae on either

00:39:42.889 --> 00:39:43.659
side here.
 

00:39:43.659 --> 00:39:46.570
You can imagine the Dacians in
the second tier.

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.909
The roofed Basilica Ulpia here.
 

00:39:49.909 --> 00:39:53.659
The Column of Trajan,
flanked by the Latin and Greek

00:39:53.659 --> 00:39:58.070
libraries, and then over here
the Temple to Divine Trajan.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:01.759
The plan, again,
and here I just want to

00:40:01.759 --> 00:40:04.378
mention,
looking back at that plan,

00:40:04.378 --> 00:40:07.840
that there was also another
elaborate entranceway from the

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.079
main part of the forum,
into the Basilica Ulpia,

00:40:11.079 --> 00:40:12.280
on its long side.
 

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.338
And once again,
how fortunate we are that we

00:40:15.338 --> 00:40:17.688
have coins that say
BASILICAVLPIA,

00:40:17.688 --> 00:40:19.039
Basilica Ulpia.
 

00:40:19.039 --> 00:40:21.987
So we can guess,
I think quite accurately,

00:40:21.987 --> 00:40:25.440
that this must be the
entranceway to the Basilica

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:26.159
Ulpia.
 

00:40:26.159 --> 00:40:27.789
Here we see something different.
 

00:40:27.789 --> 00:40:30.476
We see three openings,
not arcuated openings but

00:40:30.476 --> 00:40:33.050
trabeated openings,
straight lintels above.

00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:36.659
But look again in the way in
which they're represented.

00:40:36.659 --> 00:40:39.822
It looks like they're quite
solid, and that they project

00:40:39.822 --> 00:40:41.489
into the spectator's space.
 

00:40:41.489 --> 00:40:44.239
So again this idea of
projection, recession,

00:40:44.239 --> 00:40:47.500
projection, recession,
across this façade.

00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:49.469
This is very important because,
as I mentioned,

00:40:49.469 --> 00:40:53.800
Roman architecture,
using the traditional language

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.021
of Greek architecture,
ultimately developed something

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:58.809
that we call a baroque trend in
Roman architecture,

00:40:58.809 --> 00:41:01.239
and you see it happening here,
in Rome,

00:41:01.239 --> 00:41:06.199
based on the experiments of
Domitian's Forum Transitorium.

00:41:06.199 --> 00:41:09.730
And you can see that same,
roughly that same scheme here.

00:41:09.730 --> 00:41:12.327
Up above, once again,
a chariot, in this case a

00:41:12.327 --> 00:41:15.009
four-horse chariot,
seemingly with one figure,

00:41:15.009 --> 00:41:19.489
and a series of standards,
being held, possibly by Roman

00:41:19.489 --> 00:41:20.500
soldiers.
 

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:26.570
The Forum of Trajan has been
the professional,

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:33.246
the life work of a professor,
formerly of Northwestern

00:41:33.246 --> 00:41:35.722
University,
James Packer,

00:41:35.722 --> 00:41:38.469
who spent a very long time
pulling together all the

00:41:38.469 --> 00:41:41.380
evidence that the Forum of
Trajan still provides,

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:44.690
to allow a very good
reconstruction of what that

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:46.099
forum looked like.
 

00:41:46.099 --> 00:41:47.460
It's computer generated.
 

00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.610
I urge you all to look at it.
 

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:53.949
If you just Google James
Packer, Forum of Trajan,

00:41:53.949 --> 00:41:57.230
UCLA--because that's the,
or the Getty,

00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:59.503
either of those two,
because UCLA and the Getty

00:41:59.503 --> 00:42:02.717
supported this work--
you will be able to see

00:42:02.717 --> 00:42:05.789
computer simulations of his
work.

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:09.646
There's also a book by James
Packer on the Forum of Trajan,

00:42:09.646 --> 00:42:12.039
that's on reserve for this
course.

00:42:12.039 --> 00:42:14.471
I send you to it,
less for the Forum of Trajan,

00:42:14.471 --> 00:42:17.643
but for any of you working on
city plans, again this could be

00:42:17.643 --> 00:42:19.599
a very inspiring book to look
at.

00:42:19.599 --> 00:42:23.000
Not that I expect you to come
up with something like this,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.434
but nonetheless I think it can
give you an idea of what one can

00:42:27.434 --> 00:42:31.010
do as one thinks about designing
one's own city.

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.744
He has done enough research to
allow a very accurate

00:42:33.744 --> 00:42:36.800
reconstruction of what this
forum would've looked like.

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.746
We're looking at the
entranceway into the Basilica

00:42:39.746 --> 00:42:40.530
Ulpia here.
 

00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:44.987
We are looking at the marble;
you can see real marble and

00:42:44.987 --> 00:42:47.659
variegated marbles brought from
all over the world.

00:42:47.659 --> 00:42:51.344
So Trajan continues the Flavian
tradition of bringing marbles

00:42:51.344 --> 00:42:53.525
from all over,
from places outside of

00:42:53.525 --> 00:42:55.827
Italy--from Africa,
from Asia Minor,

00:42:55.827 --> 00:42:59.199
from Egypt and so on--
for the decoration of these

00:42:59.199 --> 00:43:02.132
buildings,
and an interest in multicolored

00:43:02.132 --> 00:43:03.489
marbles as facing.
 

00:43:03.489 --> 00:43:06.835
We see also up here the Dacian
prisoners, and between them,

00:43:06.835 --> 00:43:08.621
in this instance,
these shields,

00:43:08.621 --> 00:43:10.179
with portraits on them.
 

00:43:10.179 --> 00:43:11.630
We have remains of some of
those.

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:13.389
So that's an accurate
reconstruction,

00:43:13.389 --> 00:43:16.130
the same sort of thing that we
saw on the entranceway.

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:20.434
Then up there an inscription,
several other Dacians,

00:43:20.434 --> 00:43:23.809
and some other decoration at
the apex.

00:43:23.809 --> 00:43:26.070
I'm going to show you just a
few of these quickly,

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.039
from Packer's book.
 

00:43:27.039 --> 00:43:30.413
You see here a corridor with a
barrel vault,

00:43:30.413 --> 00:43:33.630
stuccoed and painted,
lots of statuary.

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:36.887
There would have been lots of
honorific statuary in this

00:43:36.887 --> 00:43:37.599
structure.
 

00:43:37.599 --> 00:43:40.971
Sometimes instead of the
shields, with portraits between

00:43:40.971 --> 00:43:44.157
the Dacians, we see piles of
captured arms and armor,

00:43:44.157 --> 00:43:46.119
as you can see in that view.
 

00:43:46.119 --> 00:43:49.594
Here a couple more,
showing again the marble

00:43:49.594 --> 00:43:53.070
decoration of the walls,
varied in color.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:57.670
Here niches with portraits.
 

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.179
Over here, more shields with
portraits.

00:44:00.179 --> 00:44:04.717
And here you can see some of
the sculptural remains:

00:44:04.717 --> 00:44:08.989
some parts of a military figure
in a breastplate,

00:44:08.989 --> 00:44:13.440
a man--both of them headless--a
man in a toga.

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:17.130
And over here part of one of
these decorative shields with a

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:17.820
portrait.
 

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:20.030
We actually think this is a
portrait of Nerva,

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:24.000
a portrait of Nerva that
would've been placed inside this

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.829
shield and hung on the upper
part of the wall above the

00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:28.679
columns.
 

00:44:28.679 --> 00:44:31.630
And this is important,
and on your Monument List.

00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:35.373
This is a view of the Basilica
Ulpia in Rome,

00:44:35.373 --> 00:44:39.289
what it would have looked like
in antiquity.

00:44:39.289 --> 00:44:42.315
You can see it conforms to
basilican architecture that

00:44:42.315 --> 00:44:46.036
we've looked at before,
with a central nave,

00:44:46.036 --> 00:44:49.730
divided by its two side
aisles--

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.559
in this case,
as you'll recall in plan--

00:44:51.559 --> 00:44:57.663
and those are Corinthian
capitals, as you can see down

00:44:57.663 --> 00:44:58.469
here.
 

00:44:58.469 --> 00:45:02.369
You can see also that it's a
gargantuan structure.

00:45:02.369 --> 00:45:06.338
Look at the size of the people,
the men in their togas,

00:45:06.338 --> 00:45:08.250
and the building itself.
 

00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:11.494
And it had a flat roof with a
coffered ceiling,

00:45:11.494 --> 00:45:14.530
and you can see that it had a
clerestory.

00:45:14.530 --> 00:45:16.070
We've talked about the
clerestory before.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:18.949
We saw it in the House of the
Mosaic Atrium,

00:45:18.949 --> 00:45:20.516
for example,
the clerestory,

00:45:20.516 --> 00:45:22.780
which is the opening up of the
wall,

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:26.250
in this case through Ionic
columns,

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:29.905
to see the vistas that lie
beyond, and to let light into

00:45:29.905 --> 00:45:30.969
the structure.
 

00:45:30.969 --> 00:45:36.070
And you can see the vista that
lies beyond, of the Column of

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:39.010
Trajan and one of the libraries.
 

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:42.360
This is a photograph that I'm
incredibly proud of,

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:46.190
because I took it from on top
of the Column of Trajan.

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:48.730
It's not that difficult to
climb the Column the Trajan

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:51.318
because there's a spiral
staircase in the center of it,

00:45:51.318 --> 00:45:52.659
that goes up to the top.
 

00:45:52.659 --> 00:45:57.000
The part that's hard is getting
permission to get in there.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.425
It's always locked,
and you have to get special

00:45:58.425 --> 00:45:59.170
permission to do that.
 

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.003
So I did it only once,
but it was a great thing to do,

00:46:02.003 --> 00:46:04.889
and you go way up to the top,
and you can look down.

00:46:04.889 --> 00:46:06.530
You can see fantastic views of
Rome.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:10.471
But you can also get a very
good sense of what the Basilica

00:46:10.471 --> 00:46:12.849
Ulpia looks like today:
not much.

00:46:12.849 --> 00:46:14.710
But you can see the central
space.

00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:16.050
You can see some of the columns.
 

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:18.369
We can tell that those columns
were grey granite.

00:46:18.369 --> 00:46:21.141
So again, this interest in
contrasting marbles,

00:46:21.141 --> 00:46:24.516
grey granite with white marble,
in the Basilica Ulpia and

00:46:24.516 --> 00:46:25.360
elsewhere.
 

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.931
And you can also see the
relationship between modern

00:46:27.931 --> 00:46:29.811
ground level,
which is much higher,

00:46:29.811 --> 00:46:32.375
and ancient ground level,
and the possibilities that

00:46:32.375 --> 00:46:34.965
still remain,
if they want to excavate this

00:46:34.965 --> 00:46:37.918
part of the city --
what more of the Forum of

00:46:37.918 --> 00:46:39.949
Trajan may be able to be seen.
 

00:46:39.949 --> 00:46:42.050
Some of it can actually be seen
under the street,

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:45.231
and Packer and others have
actually gone in to look at what

00:46:45.231 --> 00:46:47.523
is there,
which is what has enabled him

00:46:47.523 --> 00:46:50.789
to make the kind of accurate
reconstructions that he has.

00:46:50.789 --> 00:46:53.335
Everywhere in this monument
there are references--yes,

00:46:53.335 --> 00:46:55.882
this is a forum;
yes, forums have practical

00:46:55.882 --> 00:46:56.530
purposes.
 

00:46:56.530 --> 00:47:01.293
They're a place for people to
meet and to market and to

00:47:01.293 --> 00:47:05.440
conduct law cases and so on,
in the basilica.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.760
But this monument reminds you
again and again and again and

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.378
again that it is a monument in
stone to Trajan's victories over

00:47:14.378 --> 00:47:15.570
the Dacians.
 

00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:18.603
And not only do we see those
Dacians, as we looked at before,

00:47:18.603 --> 00:47:21.382
but we see lots of other
imagery that refers to military

00:47:21.382 --> 00:47:21.989
victory.
 

00:47:21.989 --> 00:47:24.699
This is a fragment of what we
think was a frieze,

00:47:24.699 --> 00:47:28.900
in the Basilica Ulpia,
that depicts victories,

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:31.210
female personifications of
victory,

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:33.889
winged, either kneeling at
candelabra,

00:47:33.889 --> 00:47:36.697
or over here,
this woman, kneeling on the

00:47:36.697 --> 00:47:37.889
back of a bull.
 

00:47:37.889 --> 00:47:39.659
You can see that she's winged.
 

00:47:39.659 --> 00:47:41.889
She's holding the snout of that
bull back.

00:47:41.889 --> 00:47:45.751
She's got a knife in her right
hand, and she is about to slit

00:47:45.751 --> 00:47:47.360
the throat of the bull.
 

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:53.050
And she is doing this to--not
only is victory over the Dacians

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:56.442
being marked here,
but she is also representing

00:47:56.442 --> 00:47:59.409
the sacrifice that takes place
in honor of that victory,

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:05.739
by being shown depicting
killing a bull.

00:48:05.739 --> 00:48:08.960
Back to the plan once again,
just to remind you that when we

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.101
leave the Basilica Ulpia--
a doorway also in its long

00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:14.460
side--we end up in this small
plaza,

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.880
where the temple--where the
Column of Trajan is located,

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.389
flanked by Greek and Latin
libraries,

00:48:20.389 --> 00:48:25.563
on axis with the entranceway,
the equestrian statue of

00:48:25.563 --> 00:48:28.275
Trajan,
the other entranceway,

00:48:28.275 --> 00:48:31.429
the column, and ultimately the
temple,

00:48:31.429 --> 00:48:34.635
at the very end:
the temple ultimately to divine

00:48:34.635 --> 00:48:35.250
Trajan.
 

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.663
This is a model of what we
think the library may have

00:48:37.663 --> 00:48:39.711
looked like,
or both of the libraries may

00:48:39.711 --> 00:48:41.500
have looked like from the
outside --

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:44.731
fairly smallish square
buildings with a portico in the

00:48:44.731 --> 00:48:47.126
front,
and then, most important,

00:48:47.126 --> 00:48:48.679
a balcony over here.
 

00:48:48.679 --> 00:48:50.110
Why a balcony?
 

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:53.351
So that you could come out and
look at the Column of Trajan,

00:48:53.351 --> 00:48:55.989
and read some of the scenes
that encircled it.

00:48:55.989 --> 00:48:58.271
This is a reconstruction,
from Packer again,

00:48:58.271 --> 00:49:00.925
showing what he thinks the
interior of one of these

00:49:00.925 --> 00:49:02.889
libraries might have looked
like.

00:49:02.889 --> 00:49:04.480
It looks larger here than it
actually was.

00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:07.389
But you can get a sense of it,
with the reading tables,

00:49:07.389 --> 00:49:11.159
with the scrolls inside these
cabinets here,

00:49:11.159 --> 00:49:14.634
with the statuary,
and in this case he believes

00:49:14.634 --> 00:49:19.809
that it had a vaulted roof,
as you can see on top.

00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:23.010
The Column of Trajan,
you see it here in two views;

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:27.389
an extraordinary work of art,
extremely well preserved.

00:49:27.389 --> 00:49:28.860
Why so well preserved?
 

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:32.550
Well likely because Pope Sixtus
V, in the Renaissance,

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:35.431
used this column,
and also the column of the

00:49:35.431 --> 00:49:37.759
later emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

00:49:37.759 --> 00:49:41.775
as important nodes in his
reconstruction of the city of

00:49:41.775 --> 00:49:42.369
Rome.
 

00:49:42.369 --> 00:49:44.360
What he did,
however, at that time,

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:47.934
was that he took the statues of
Trajan that would've stood on

00:49:47.934 --> 00:49:50.322
this one,
and Marcus Aurelius on the

00:49:50.322 --> 00:49:53.989
other, and replaced them with
statues of Peter and Paul.

00:49:53.989 --> 00:49:56.666
And it's Peter who's on the
Column of Trajan,

00:49:56.666 --> 00:49:59.768
and Paul who is on the Column
of Marcus Aurelius.

00:49:59.768 --> 00:50:01.530
But you can see how well
preserved they are here.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:05.251
The column shaft rests on a
base, decorated with arms and

00:50:05.251 --> 00:50:07.784
armor,
Dacian arms and armor,

00:50:07.784 --> 00:50:10.949
with a statue of Trajan up at
the--

00:50:10.949 --> 00:50:12.809
a bronze statue of Trajan at
the uppermost part.

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:16.969
But what's particularly
interesting is the sculpture--

00:50:16.969 --> 00:50:18.409
I'm not going to go into that
in great detail,

00:50:18.409 --> 00:50:20.938
but I want you to know about
it, because it does tell us

00:50:20.938 --> 00:50:23.530
something about architecture,
as we'll see.

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:25.804
It's a spiral frieze,
done all in marble,

00:50:25.804 --> 00:50:28.592
of course, that wraps from the
base of the column,

00:50:28.592 --> 00:50:30.300
all the way up to the top.
 

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.400
And it tells,
in documentary form,

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:35.902
the exploits,
the military exploits of

00:50:35.902 --> 00:50:38.481
Trajan,
in his two Dacian military

00:50:38.481 --> 00:50:41.507
campaigns--
those two campaigns that I've

00:50:41.507 --> 00:50:44.635
already mentioned--
divided in the center by a

00:50:44.635 --> 00:50:46.469
Victory writing on a shield.
 

00:50:46.469 --> 00:50:49.280
There's been a lot of
speculation;

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:52.844
there's nothing like this
earlier in Roman art quite like

00:50:52.844 --> 00:50:53.289
this.
 

00:50:53.289 --> 00:50:56.918
And so it is a new innovation,
probably at the behest

00:50:56.918 --> 00:51:00.197
of--possibly out of the mind,
the creative mind,

00:51:00.197 --> 00:51:02.360
of Apollodorus of Damascus.
 

00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:05.300
And some scholars have
suggested, and I think very

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:07.646
convincingly,
it's an intriguing idea,

00:51:07.646 --> 00:51:10.768
that because this was located
between two libraries,

00:51:10.768 --> 00:51:14.159
the likelihood--and that the
Romans had scrolls--

00:51:14.159 --> 00:51:17.190
the likelihood is what we are
dealing with here is one of

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:20.135
these scrolls,
sort of wrapped around the

00:51:20.135 --> 00:51:24.865
column, from base to top,
unfurled and wrapped around the

00:51:24.865 --> 00:51:28.489
column from base to top,
with the text removed,

00:51:28.489 --> 00:51:30.360
with images instead of text.
 

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:34.523
And that makes a lot of sense,
again given that you could view

00:51:34.523 --> 00:51:37.800
it best from the two libraries
on either side.

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:41.170
A detail of the base,
just to show you how very well

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:43.880
preserved the sculptural
decoration is.

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.170
This is not a course in
sculpture.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:46.849
I'm not going to go into this
in detail,

00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:49.280
but I want to quickly show you
some of the scenes,

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:51.090
because again they can be
revealing,

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:52.789
from the point of view of
architecture.

00:51:52.789 --> 00:51:53.739
This is at the very base.
 

00:51:53.739 --> 00:51:57.186
We see a personification of the
Danube River,

00:51:57.186 --> 00:52:01.336
in that area up north,
in Dacia, where the Romans went

00:52:01.336 --> 00:52:03.530
to conquer those tribes.
 

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:07.014
And this is very important,
because we know that

00:52:07.014 --> 00:52:10.943
Apollodorus of Damascus was
responsible for building a

00:52:10.943 --> 00:52:13.389
bridge over the Danube River.
 

00:52:13.389 --> 00:52:16.460
It was one of his great
engineering feats.

00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:20.070
And you actually see that
bridge located here,

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:23.480
which even increases the
likelihood that Apollodorus of

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:27.079
Damascus was the designer of
this particular structure.

00:52:27.079 --> 00:52:29.599
You see the Roman soldiers have
gotten off boats.

00:52:29.599 --> 00:52:32.449
They're walking through an
archway.

00:52:32.449 --> 00:52:34.460
Here you see the Roman soldiers.
 

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:38.070
The Roman soldiers did not only
do battle, but they also

00:52:38.070 --> 00:52:40.500
Romanized the areas that they
went.

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.510
We've talked about this a lot:
the colonization of the Roman

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:46.418
world, Trajan extending the
borders to their furthest most

00:52:46.418 --> 00:52:46.980
points.
 

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.159
The Romans get there,
what do they do?

00:52:49.159 --> 00:52:50.849
They start to build
architecture.

00:52:50.849 --> 00:52:53.909
They start to build walls with
headers and stretchers.

00:52:53.909 --> 00:52:58.409
They start to build forts and
city walls, in which they put

00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:00.969
buildings with Roman amenities.
 

00:53:00.969 --> 00:53:05.925
Remember, after the war is
over, they're often given land

00:53:05.925 --> 00:53:10.032
by the general,
or the emperor -- it becomes

00:53:10.032 --> 00:53:13.014
theirs,
and where they can live from

00:53:13.014 --> 00:53:14.179
that point on.
 

00:53:14.179 --> 00:53:17.487
So they had every reason to
want to fill these towns with

00:53:17.487 --> 00:53:18.550
Roman amenities.
 

00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:22.418
And we see the Roman soldiers
building cities in many of these

00:53:22.418 --> 00:53:22.989
scenes.
 

00:53:22.989 --> 00:53:25.302
This is the most famous scene
from the column,

00:53:25.302 --> 00:53:27.512
in which we see a battle
between the Romans,

00:53:27.512 --> 00:53:30.030
inside one of these forts that
they've built.

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:33.000
They are all with helmets and
shields.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.869
They have their hands around
something;

00:53:34.869 --> 00:53:38.313
we think these were probably
spears that were added in metal,

00:53:38.313 --> 00:53:39.059
originally.
 

00:53:39.059 --> 00:53:41.039
The Dacians down below.
 

00:53:41.039 --> 00:53:45.025
You can identify them by their
leggings and tunics and scraggly

00:53:45.025 --> 00:53:46.570
hair and beards,
here.

00:53:46.570 --> 00:53:49.159
They are attacking the camp.
 

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:51.016
The Romans are,
of course, going to be

00:53:51.016 --> 00:53:53.154
victorious,
but the Dacians are shown as

00:53:53.154 --> 00:53:56.085
heroic and valiant,
and enemies who are pretty much

00:53:56.085 --> 00:53:58.420
the equals of the Romans in
strength,

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:02.500
which only underscores that the
Romans were stronger still,

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:03.880
to have conquered them.
 

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:06.485
And then over here,
if you've ever wondered where

00:54:06.485 --> 00:54:08.550
the term 'battering ram' came
from,

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:10.333
you can see it right here--I
told you the Romans invented

00:54:10.333 --> 00:54:12.860
everything--
you can see it right here:

00:54:12.860 --> 00:54:15.639
this pole,
with a ram's head at the end,

00:54:15.639 --> 00:54:18.400
which is serving again as a
battering ram,

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.550
as they try to tear down the
walls of the Roman fort.

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:26.119
Perhaps the most poignant and
interesting scene happens way up

00:54:26.119 --> 00:54:29.217
at the top of the column,
where the leader of the

00:54:29.217 --> 00:54:32.255
Dacians, Decebalus,
D-e-c-e-b-a-l-u-s,

00:54:32.255 --> 00:54:35.255
is shown kneeling,
almost like one of those

00:54:35.255 --> 00:54:37.650
Victories,
on the bull.

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:40.659
He has a knife in his hand.
 

00:54:40.659 --> 00:54:41.969
What is he doing?
 

00:54:41.969 --> 00:54:43.119
He is kneeling here.
 

00:54:43.119 --> 00:54:45.360
He has decided--you can see the
Romans;

00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.650
he's got Romans to the left of
him, Romans to the right of him.

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:50.990
He's about to be taken prisoner
by them and paraded in a

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:54.090
triumphal procession in Rome,
in honor of Trajan.

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:56.724
He doesn't want to do that,
so he heroically,

00:54:56.724 --> 00:54:58.639
valiantly, takes his own life.
 

00:54:58.639 --> 00:55:01.226
He is about to plunge that
knife into his heart,

00:55:01.226 --> 00:55:04.090
so that he doesn't have to be
taken by the Romans.

00:55:04.090 --> 00:55:08.164
It's very interesting to see
them depicting,

00:55:08.164 --> 00:55:12.809
the Romans depicting,
the Dacians in such a heroic

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.989
way on this column.
 

00:55:14.989 --> 00:55:19.090
I mentioned the museum in Rome
that is located in EUR,

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:21.268
the Museo della Civiltà
Romana,

00:55:21.268 --> 00:55:24.331
the Museum of Roman
Civilization,

00:55:24.331 --> 00:55:27.010
that has casts and models.
 

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:28.592
I mentioned that they had casts
of all the scenes from the

00:55:28.592 --> 00:55:29.119
Column of Trajan.
 

00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:31.518
I show you a view that I took
in that museum,

00:55:31.518 --> 00:55:34.369
just to give you a sense of how
one can see those,

00:55:34.369 --> 00:55:36.420
and how one can see those at
eye's level,

00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.309
to get a good sense of them.
 

00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:40.610
In antiquity they would have
been harder to read.

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:44.695
But I should point out that the
background was likely painted

00:55:44.695 --> 00:55:46.501
blue,
and there probably would have

00:55:46.501 --> 00:55:48.579
been some additions,
like the metal spears,

00:55:48.579 --> 00:55:50.670
that might have made it easier
to read--

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:54.559
almost like Wedgwood--might
have made it easier to read in

00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:55.380
antiquity.
 

00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:58.389
And I also thought I would
mention--

00:55:58.389 --> 00:56:00.590
I'm sure all of you have been
down to Ground Zero,

00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:04.119
but if you go a block or two
away from Ground Zero itself,

00:56:04.119 --> 00:56:05.969
there's the Fireman's Memorial
there,

00:56:05.969 --> 00:56:09.532
that was put up to many of the
fireman who sadly lost their

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:12.480
lives fighting those fires in
the Twin Towers.

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.382
We see this here:
"Dedicated to those who

00:56:15.382 --> 00:56:18.219
fell and to those who carry
on" here.

00:56:18.219 --> 00:56:19.739
And what's interesting about
this,

00:56:19.739 --> 00:56:21.445
if you look,
if you Google this and look at

00:56:21.445 --> 00:56:23.639
the website for the Fireman's
Memorial in New York,

00:56:23.639 --> 00:56:28.190
you will find out that the
designer for this talks

00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:33.391
unabashedly of his admiration
for the Column of Trajan in

00:56:33.391 --> 00:56:35.501
Rome,
and that he used,

00:56:35.501 --> 00:56:38.846
as an artistic model,
for the way in which he massed

00:56:38.846 --> 00:56:41.356
figures here,
showing them in relationship to

00:56:41.356 --> 00:56:43.657
buildings,
he used, as his model,

00:56:43.657 --> 00:56:46.539
the figures on the Column of
Trajan,

00:56:46.539 --> 00:56:48.230
in Rome.
 

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:51.057
At the end again,
the column, surrounded by the

00:56:51.057 --> 00:56:54.318
Greek and Latin libraries,
the temple over here at the

00:56:54.318 --> 00:56:54.809
end.
 

00:56:54.809 --> 00:56:56.637
You can see it's a conventional
Roman temple:

00:56:56.637 --> 00:56:59.476
deep porch,
freestanding columns,

00:56:59.476 --> 00:57:03.599
staircase, one staircase,
façade orientation,

00:57:03.599 --> 00:57:05.739
just as we saw elsewhere.
 

00:57:05.739 --> 00:57:09.757
Here we see an engraving
showing the spiral staircase

00:57:09.757 --> 00:57:12.230
that leads from bottom to top.
 

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:15.514
And over here,
that the staircase also goes

00:57:15.514 --> 00:57:18.329
down below, into a burial
chamber.

00:57:18.329 --> 00:57:20.619
Two urns were found in that
burial chamber;

00:57:20.619 --> 00:57:23.496
the urns of Trajan and Plotina,
which tells us,

00:57:23.496 --> 00:57:26.750
of course, that this also
served as Trajan's tomb.

00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:29.210
So a victory,
not only one of his great

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:33.159
victories, military victories,
but also victory over death.

00:57:33.159 --> 00:57:36.454
And then at the apex,
we see a good view of the top,

00:57:36.454 --> 00:57:37.748
with a statue of St.
 

00:57:37.748 --> 00:57:40.731
Peter;
but we have coins depicting

00:57:40.731 --> 00:57:44.000
Trajan on--
depicting the original

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.188
statue--the base,
the shaft, a portrait of

00:57:48.188 --> 00:57:51.719
Trajan, a naked portrait of
Trajan,

00:57:51.719 --> 00:57:55.159
a heroicized portrait of
Trajan, depicted after death,

00:57:55.159 --> 00:57:57.360
divinized at the apex of the
column.

00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.242
And if you read the inscription
on the coin, you see it refers

00:58:01.242 --> 00:58:03.280
to Trajan as Optimus Princeps.
 

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:04.980
Trajan received many titles.
 

00:58:04.980 --> 00:58:07.003
One was Dacicus,
D-a-c-i-c-u-s,

00:58:07.003 --> 00:58:09.500
for his victories over the
Dacians;

00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.730
but at the end of his life
Optimus Princeps,

00:58:11.730 --> 00:58:13.960
the greatest princeps of
all time.

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:16.599
The implication:
greater than Augustus.

00:58:16.599 --> 00:58:19.503
And it is arguable,
I think probably correct,

00:58:19.503 --> 00:58:22.539
that Trajan was the even
greater of the two.

00:58:22.539 --> 00:58:26.349
This is a restored view,
a spectacular restored view,

00:58:26.349 --> 00:58:30.168
of the building complex,
where you can see again the

00:58:30.168 --> 00:58:33.367
entranceway over here,
the equestrian statue,

00:58:33.367 --> 00:58:35.360
everything that we've
described.

00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:38.284
But I think it's interesting,
if you think of yourself having

00:58:38.284 --> 00:58:40.483
entered into this forum,
standing here,

00:58:40.483 --> 00:58:43.829
looking back at the basilica
bearing Trajan's name,

00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:46.619
looking toward the column and
the temple.

00:58:46.619 --> 00:58:50.420
What you would have likely seen
when you stood here was only the

00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:53.742
uppermost part of the column;
because most of it would have

00:58:53.742 --> 00:58:56.050
been blocked by the very tall
Basilica Ulpia.

00:58:56.050 --> 00:58:59.050
So it's a very theatrical
representation,

00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:03.079
in the sense that you would be
standing here with Trajan,

00:59:03.079 --> 00:59:05.278
during life,
looking back toward that

00:59:05.278 --> 00:59:06.934
column,
looking back at the

00:59:06.934 --> 00:59:09.327
divinization of Trajan,
a bronze statue,

00:59:09.327 --> 00:59:13.014
which would have seemed as if
it was floating on top of the

00:59:13.014 --> 00:59:14.159
Basilica Ulpia.
 

00:59:14.159 --> 00:59:17.398
This is a very dramatic
tableau, created here by

00:59:17.398 --> 00:59:19.190
Apollodorus of Damascus.
 

00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:23.922
And I think it was not equaled
until the seventeenth century by

00:59:23.922 --> 00:59:28.351
architects like Gian Lorenzo
Bernini, who also created such

00:59:28.351 --> 00:59:30.260
spectacular tableaus.
 

00:59:30.260 --> 00:59:33.487
Just to show you again the
location of the Markets of

00:59:33.487 --> 00:59:36.530
Trajan, in relationship to the
Forum of Trajan.

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:41.467
While the forum was the Romans
imposing a rectangular plan on

00:59:41.467 --> 00:59:43.757
nature--
remember, they have to cut back

00:59:43.757 --> 00:59:46.074
the hill,
to make way for it--the markets

00:59:46.074 --> 00:59:47.869
are something quite different.
 

00:59:47.869 --> 00:59:51.047
They are the Romans accepting
the shape of the remaining

00:59:51.047 --> 00:59:54.068
Quirinal Hill,
and allowing the shape of that

00:59:54.068 --> 00:59:57.739
hill to determine the irregular
shape of the markets.

00:59:57.739 --> 01:00:01.641
The markets,
unlike the forum that is made

01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:04.894
out of marble,
for the most part--as we've

01:00:04.894 --> 01:00:09.063
seen, variegated marble--
the markets are made out of

01:00:09.063 --> 01:00:11.170
concrete,
faced with brick:

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:13.914
a very different material,
but a material that is

01:00:13.914 --> 01:00:16.909
absolutely appropriate,
when you want to cover a

01:00:16.909 --> 01:00:21.213
hillside with tiered buildings,
looking back very much to the

01:00:21.213 --> 01:00:23.322
spa at Baia,
looking back to Fortuna

01:00:23.322 --> 01:00:25.670
Primigenia,
at Palestrina.

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:27.802
The same idea,
to turn this hill,

01:00:27.802 --> 01:00:31.469
what remained of the Quirinal
Hill, into essentially the

01:00:31.469 --> 01:00:34.268
precursor of the modern shopping
mall.

01:00:34.268 --> 01:00:37.621
You have shopping--there are
150 shops in the Markets of

01:00:37.621 --> 01:00:38.170
Trajan.
 

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:41.688
All of these things date,
by the way, to the same period,

01:00:41.688 --> 01:00:42.378
around A.D.
 

01:00:42.378 --> 01:00:44.829
113, the forum and also the
markets.

01:00:44.829 --> 01:00:50.010
We see 150 shops here,
on a variety of levels.

01:00:50.010 --> 01:00:53.115
This is the bottom level,
that is located where the

01:00:53.115 --> 01:00:56.159
exedra, the first exedra is,
on the right side.

01:00:56.159 --> 01:00:58.119
A great hemicycle, with shops.
 

01:00:58.119 --> 01:01:01.650
Here, a street,
called the Via Biberatica;

01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:03.510
that name is on your Monument
List.

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:06.260
And then a covered bazaar up
here.

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.614
All of this on different levels;
all of this done in a very

01:01:09.614 --> 01:01:12.539
innovative way,
with concrete faced with brick.

01:01:12.539 --> 01:01:15.570
You can also see here the very
large windows;

01:01:15.570 --> 01:01:17.505
the semi-dome,
that I'll show you in detail in

01:01:17.505 --> 01:01:17.980
a moment.
 

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:21.637
These large windows indicate to
us that the architects are real

01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:23.940
masters of the concrete medium
here,

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:29.869
able to de-materialize the
wall, by putting up these very,

01:01:29.869 --> 01:01:31.010
very large windows.
 

01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:33.427
That's how good they were in
building this,

01:01:33.427 --> 01:01:34.349
at this point.
 

01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:37.751
The building block here is
essentially the taberna:

01:01:37.751 --> 01:01:39.960
not unlike what we saw in
Pompeii,

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.030
this small space with a barrel
vault,

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:46.916
an attic window above,
and in this case with a post

01:01:46.916 --> 01:01:50.018
and lintel scheme,
made out of travertine,

01:01:50.018 --> 01:01:52.510
to mark the entranceway into
the shop.

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:56.608
They took this individual
motif, and they replicated it

01:01:56.608 --> 01:02:00.706
throughout this building,
over and over and over again,

01:02:00.706 --> 01:02:03.059
offering 150 possibilities.
 

01:02:03.059 --> 01:02:04.889
Here you see a series of these
in a row,

01:02:04.889 --> 01:02:06.512
a series of these
tabernae,

01:02:06.512 --> 01:02:09.237
with their attic windows,
with their travertine

01:02:09.237 --> 01:02:11.550
decoration, with their sidewalks
--

01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:13.679
a kind of mini city within a
city.

01:02:13.679 --> 01:02:16.889
And then over here the
polygonal masonry of the

01:02:16.889 --> 01:02:20.380
streets, looking very much like
streets in Rome.

01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.670
Here is a view of the great
hemicycle, down on the first

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:24.150
story.
 

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:25.900
We see the shops again.
 

01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:29.202
What's interesting here is in
the second story you see

01:02:29.202 --> 01:02:30.449
arcuated elements.
 

01:02:30.449 --> 01:02:33.023
You can see the facing
with--the brick facing,

01:02:33.023 --> 01:02:35.597
although we do believe this was
stuccoed over,

01:02:35.597 --> 01:02:36.570
in this case.
 

01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:38.039
Here, pilasters.
 

01:02:38.039 --> 01:02:39.150
But look very carefully.
 

01:02:39.150 --> 01:02:40.768
You'll see these pilasters
support,

01:02:40.768 --> 01:02:43.940
in the center,
an arcuated pediment,

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.349
and then on either side these
broken triangular pediments,

01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:50.420
as if the pediment has broken,
been broken,

01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:53.840
to allow the arcuated pediment
to show through.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.360
We have never seen that before.
 

01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.829
Yes, we saw it in the paper
topics, but that stuff is later.

01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:59.969
We have not seen that,
up to this point

01:02:59.969 --> 01:03:02.280
chronologically,
in built architecture.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.659
We have seen it in
painting--Cubiculum at the Met,

01:03:05.659 --> 01:03:09.101
over here, for example--this
breaking the triangular pediment

01:03:09.101 --> 01:03:11.510
to allow something else to show
through.

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:14.623
This is the beginning of this
experimentation that ultimately

01:03:14.623 --> 01:03:17.684
leads to this baroque element in
Roman architecture that I'm

01:03:17.684 --> 01:03:18.929
going to talk about.
 

01:03:18.929 --> 01:03:21.987
Behind the hemicycle,
annular vault,

01:03:21.987 --> 01:03:26.791
with an additional set of
shops, and attic windows there

01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:27.840
as well.
 

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:34.409
This is the most famous street,
from the Markets of Trajan.

01:03:34.409 --> 01:03:36.550
It's an incredible place to
wander, by the way.

01:03:36.550 --> 01:03:39.070
And they have just recently,
in the last couple of years,

01:03:39.070 --> 01:03:41.550
opened an entirely new museum
here,

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:45.320
which has a lot of remains from
the forum,

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.860
from the markets,
and a great deal of very useful

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.612
information: an absolute
must-see for anyone going to

01:03:50.612 --> 01:03:51.090
Rome.
 

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:55.248
This is the famous Via
Biberatica of the Markets of

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:57.269
Trajan,
where again you get the sense,

01:03:57.269 --> 01:03:59.889
once you're in here that you're
in a kind of city within a city,

01:03:59.889 --> 01:04:01.800
but with all these wonderful
shops.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:05.139
You can see how skilled they
are in using ramps,

01:04:05.139 --> 01:04:08.710
with polygonal masonry,
as well as sidewalks and

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:11.411
stairs,
so that you can make your way

01:04:11.411 --> 01:04:13.619
up with either alternative here.
 

01:04:13.619 --> 01:04:16.260
Again, the tabernae on
either side;

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:21.275
the opening up of the walls,
with these incredible windows

01:04:21.275 --> 01:04:22.420
throughout.
 

01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.976
A restored view of what the
whole thing looked like in

01:04:25.976 --> 01:04:30.197
antiquity: the hemicycle;
the decoration here of the

01:04:30.197 --> 01:04:34.126
central arcuated pediment;
broken triangular pediments

01:04:34.126 --> 01:04:35.838
over here--
a very interesting space,

01:04:35.838 --> 01:04:37.610
that I'm going to show you in a
second--

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:40.079
vaulted with a semi-dome,
done out of concrete,

01:04:40.079 --> 01:04:44.010
with very large windows opening
up the space.

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:47.068
The Via Biberatica,
that we already saw here,

01:04:47.068 --> 01:04:49.780
and then the covered bazaar up
there.

01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:52.518
A quick view of the semi-dome,
made out of concrete.

01:04:52.518 --> 01:04:54.385
It doesn't have an
oculus,

01:04:54.385 --> 01:04:57.880
but otherwise it looks kind of
like the dome of the Temple of

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.980
Mercury at Baia,
as you can see.

01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:01.840
And over here,
this wall that I've already

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:04.360
described,
that shows you how well the

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:08.429
Romans can work concrete,
now enabling them to open up

01:05:08.429 --> 01:05:10.856
the wall,
much more than they've been

01:05:10.856 --> 01:05:14.382
able to do so before,
and allow even more light into

01:05:14.382 --> 01:05:15.469
the structure.
 

01:05:15.469 --> 01:05:18.449
The greatest part,
perhaps, of the Markets of

01:05:18.449 --> 01:05:20.550
Trajan is this building here.
 

01:05:20.550 --> 01:05:24.121
It's the covered bazaar,
and it really is a market

01:05:24.121 --> 01:05:25.800
bazaar, on two tiers.
 

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.697
You can see in this restored
view, this series of

01:05:28.697 --> 01:05:32.050
tabernae down below;
the attic up above.

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:34.902
You can see that groin vaults
are used here,

01:05:34.902 --> 01:05:36.429
in an incredible way.
 

01:05:36.429 --> 01:05:37.719
I'll show you in a moment how.
 

01:05:37.719 --> 01:05:39.592
A second story up here,
with additional

01:05:39.592 --> 01:05:42.489
tabernae,
opened almost completely to the

01:05:42.489 --> 01:05:45.391
sky,
an incredible feat on the part

01:05:45.391 --> 01:05:50.231
of Apollodorus of Damascus,
assuming he also designed these

01:05:50.231 --> 01:05:50.929
markets.
 

01:05:50.929 --> 01:05:52.739
Here is the market hall,
as it looks today.

01:05:52.739 --> 01:05:54.300
What is its ancestor?
 

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.713
The Ferentino Market Hall that
we saw way back when,

01:05:57.713 --> 01:06:00.434
with its single barrel vault;
or some of the

01:06:00.434 --> 01:06:03.108
cryptoporticuses that we
also saw, with their barrel

01:06:03.108 --> 01:06:03.570
vaults.
 

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:06.090
It's that idea,
that market hall idea.

01:06:06.090 --> 01:06:10.146
But look how sophisticated the
Romans have become in their use

01:06:10.146 --> 01:06:12.210
of concrete faced with brick.
 

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:15.204
They have realized that they
don't even need a wall,

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:16.380
to support vaults.
 

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:19.925
They can lift their vault on
top of individual piers,

01:06:19.925 --> 01:06:22.789
as they have done so
spectacularly here;

01:06:22.789 --> 01:06:24.260
lift them up.
 

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.648
I described this,
I think, in the introductory

01:06:26.648 --> 01:06:29.938
lecture as in a sense opening up
a series of umbrellas over the

01:06:29.938 --> 01:06:30.469
space.
 

01:06:30.469 --> 01:06:33.943
They have opened it up so that
light can flow in from the

01:06:33.943 --> 01:06:36.684
sides;
light can flow in from either

01:06:36.684 --> 01:06:40.789
long end, just flooding the
whole system with light.

01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:43.503
Down below, again,
the typical markets,

01:06:43.503 --> 01:06:45.860
with their attic windows above.
 

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.050
But this is a real tour de
force, probably the greatest --

01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:52.500
certainly the greatest vaulting
that we have seen thus far,

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:56.606
and again a test to just how
far the Romans have come from

01:06:56.606 --> 01:06:59.831
this to this,
by the time of the emperor

01:06:59.831 --> 01:07:00.469
Trajan.
 

01:07:00.469 --> 01:07:02.409
And any of you headed to San
Francisco,

01:07:02.409 --> 01:07:07.369
if you go to the Marketplace
there,

01:07:07.369 --> 01:07:12.139
you will see that that owes so
much to Roman antiquity,

01:07:12.139 --> 01:07:14.583
with all the
tabernae-like structures

01:07:14.583 --> 01:07:16.579
on either side;
the vaulting.

01:07:16.579 --> 01:07:19.994
I mean, this sort of thing
absolutely presupposes this kind

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:21.820
of architectural development.
 

01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:24.532
In the one minute that
remains--and that's all I need

01:07:24.532 --> 01:07:26.666
for this--
I just want to show you one

01:07:26.666 --> 01:07:29.170
last monument,
and make one basic point about

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:32.443
it, that really has more to do
with the transition from Trajan

01:07:32.443 --> 01:07:34.530
to Hadrian,
than anything else.

01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:36.713
An arch went up,
not in Rome,

01:07:36.713 --> 01:07:40.538
but in a place called
Benevento, which is about an

01:07:40.538 --> 01:07:44.204
hour's drive from Naples,
in the south of Italy,

01:07:44.204 --> 01:07:47.289
in Campania;
a place called Benevento.

01:07:47.289 --> 01:07:50.664
An arch went up between 114 to
118, honoring Trajan,

01:07:50.664 --> 01:07:53.179
and all of Trajan's
accomplishments.

01:07:53.179 --> 01:07:56.190
You can see it's covered with
sculpture, and each of those

01:07:56.190 --> 01:07:59.199
scenes represents one of the
accomplishments of Trajan.

01:07:59.199 --> 01:08:02.199
It was put up on the so-called
Via Traiana,

01:08:02.199 --> 01:08:05.563
taking Trajan's name,
a road that was built from Rome

01:08:05.563 --> 01:08:09.496
to Benevento,
and was opened during Trajan's

01:08:09.496 --> 01:08:12.516
reign,
and again, a compendium of all

01:08:12.516 --> 01:08:14.090
his accomplishments.
 

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:17.500
You can see very clearly that
it is based in general form on

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.908
the Arch of Titus in Rome:
a single central arcuated bay;

01:08:20.908 --> 01:08:24.600
the pedestals supporting double
columns on either side;

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:28.390
the inscription at the top;
the receding panels on either

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:30.680
side of that inscription.
 

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.029
The major difference,
of course, between the two,

01:08:33.029 --> 01:08:35.988
that this has sculpture only on
the inside,

01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:39.840
and sparingly in the center and
around the frieze,

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:43.429
and this has much more
sculpture, again telling us in

01:08:43.429 --> 01:08:47.300
much greater detail a list--
or describing a list of the

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:49.500
great accomplishments of Trajan.
 

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.250
The main reason that I show it
to you today,

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:55.649
besides to show that the
Flavians again served--

01:08:55.649 --> 01:09:00.307
Flavian architecture served as
an important model for Trajanic

01:09:00.307 --> 01:09:03.520
architecture,
is that a couple of the scenes

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:06.310
in the attic above are very
interesting,

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:08.310
and tell us something about the
succession.

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:14.010
Hadrian does not appear in the
lower part of the arch,

01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:15.569
in any of the scenes,
but he appears in two of the

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:17.604
scenes in the uppermost part,
which has led scholars,

01:09:17.604 --> 01:09:20.596
I think rightly,
to conclude that the arch was

01:09:20.596 --> 01:09:24.310
finished up to the attic before
Trajan's death,

01:09:24.310 --> 01:09:25.880
and that Hadrian finished it.
 

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.270
And what did he do?
 

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:29.579
He put his own portrait up
there, with Trajan's.

01:09:29.579 --> 01:09:31.939
Why was he motivated to do that?
 

01:09:31.939 --> 01:09:34.613
Well he had an ego,
as we'll see when we talk about

01:09:34.613 --> 01:09:35.948
Hadrian's architecture.
 

01:09:35.948 --> 01:09:38.417
But more than that,
it had something to do with the

01:09:38.417 --> 01:09:39.060
succession.
 

01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:45.698
We know that Trajan died on
August 8^(th) in 117 A.D.

01:09:45.698 --> 01:09:49.335
We know that on August 8^(th)
he had no successor officially

01:09:49.335 --> 01:09:49.890
chosen.
 

01:09:49.890 --> 01:09:53.149
Plotina, his wife,
was--she had no children of her

01:09:53.149 --> 01:09:55.908
own;
she was crazy about Hadrian,

01:09:55.908 --> 01:10:00.207
very much his sponsor,
and wanted to see him succeed

01:10:00.207 --> 01:10:01.050
Trajan.
 

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.085
It's likely that Trajan had the
same idea in mind,

01:10:03.085 --> 01:10:05.368
but it's a little strange,
because wouldn't he then have

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:06.739
adopted him before his death?
 

01:10:06.739 --> 01:10:08.090
Why would he have waited?
 

01:10:08.090 --> 01:10:10.720
But Plotina decides--she
consults with advisors.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.829
She says: "We're not going
to announce Trajan's death.

01:10:12.829 --> 01:10:14.470
We're going to keep it a secret.
 

01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:17.552
Tomorrow we're going to
announce that Trajan has adopted

01:10:17.552 --> 01:10:18.449
Hadrian."
 

01:10:18.449 --> 01:10:19.970
That happens on August 9^(th).
 

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:24.194
And then it was only on the
11^(th), the 11^(th) of August

01:10:24.194 --> 01:10:27.899
that Trajan's death was
announced to the public.

01:10:27.899 --> 01:10:31.350
So some hanky-panky was going
on behind the scenes.

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:35.351
But whoever made the choice,
whether it was Trajan himself

01:10:35.351 --> 01:10:38.511
or Plotina, they made a great
choice: Hadrian,

01:10:38.511 --> 01:10:41.109
an extraordinary emperor as
well.

01:10:41.109 --> 01:10:43.750
And the one point that I want
you to hold,

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.831
and keep with you over break,
and bring back when we get back

01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:48.557
together and talk,
when we get back together,

01:10:48.557 --> 01:10:52.479
about the Pantheon and
Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli,

01:10:52.479 --> 01:10:54.908
the main point that I want you
to keep in mind is what we

01:10:54.908 --> 01:10:56.470
learned from the Forum of
Trajan,

01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:59.760
and that is that Trajan
combined, in an incredible way,

01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:03.885
with the help of Apollodorus,
traditional architecture in the

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:07.956
form of the Forum,
with its marble columns and the

01:11:07.956 --> 01:11:09.900
like,
and innovative Roman

01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:12.807
architecture,
in the form of the brick-faced

01:11:12.807 --> 01:11:15.907
concrete market,
brought those together in one

01:11:15.907 --> 01:11:18.358
building,
in a way that is very different

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:20.840
from anything we've seen up to
this point.

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:24.305
And we're going to see that
Hadrian keeps that tradition

01:11:24.305 --> 01:11:27.836
alive, not only in the Pantheon,
but also in his Villa of

01:11:27.836 --> 01:11:28.529
Tivoli.
 

01:11:28.529 --> 01:11:29.989
Take care.
 

01:11:29.989 --> 01:11:32.340
Good Spring Break to everybody.

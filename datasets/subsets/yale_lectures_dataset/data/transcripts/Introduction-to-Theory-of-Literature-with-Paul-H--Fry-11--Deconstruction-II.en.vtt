00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.676
Prof: I'd like to start
with a little more discussion of

00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:08.350
Derrida before we turn to de
Man.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.174
I know already that I'm going
to forego what for me is a kind

00:00:13.174 --> 00:00:17.599
of pleasure--
-perhaps it wouldn't be for

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:24.993
you--which is an explication of
the last extraordinary sentence

00:00:24.993 --> 00:00:32.030
in Derrida's essay on page 926
in the right-hand column.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:35.990
I'm going to read it to you
just so you can reflect on it.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.629
What I'd like to do is suggest
to you that if you still haven't

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.916
determined on a paper topic,
you might very well consider

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:43.680
this one.
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.893
You may not find it congenial;
but supposing that you are

00:00:47.893 --> 00:00:51.780
intrigued by Derrida to account
for this last sentence,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.880
to show how it picks up motifs
generated throughout the essay,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.370
how it returns the essay to its
beginning,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.450
and to consider very carefully
its metaphors--

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.912
it reflects on its own
metaphors--I think you might

00:01:06.912 --> 00:01:08.159
find intriguing.
 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.174
The passage is:
Here there is a sort of

00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:15.370
question, call it historical,
of which we are only glimpsing

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.354
today,
the conception,

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:21.299
the formation,
the gestation, the labor.

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.933
I employ these words,
I admit, with a glance toward

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:29.120
the business of childbearing--
but also with a glance toward

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.849
those who,
in a company from which I do

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:35.772
not exclude myself,
turn their eyes away in the

00:01:35.772 --> 00:01:40.834
face of the as yet unnamable,
which is proclaiming itself and

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.965
which can do so,
as is necessary whenever a

00:01:43.965 --> 00:01:48.230
birth is in the offing,
only under the species of the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.236
non-species in the formless,
mute, infant,

00:01:52.236 --> 00:01:56.129
and terrifying form of
monstrosity.

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:58.970
Well, there is a sentence for
you and,

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.176
as I say, I don't have time to
explicate it but I commend it to

00:02:03.176 --> 00:02:07.450
you as a possible paper topic if
you're still in need of one.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.449
Now I do want to go back to the
relationship between Derrida and

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.639
Levi-Strauss.
 

00:02:13.639 --> 00:02:17.176
I suggested last time that
while in some ways the essay

00:02:17.176 --> 00:02:21.240
really seems to stage itself as
a critique of Levi-Strauss,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.150
to a remarkable degree,
confessed or unconfessed,

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.530
it stands on the shoulders of
Levi-Strauss;

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.050
at the same time,
however, having made use of

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.690
Levi-Strauss finding a means of
distancing himself from the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.970
source text.
 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.627
Take, for example,
page 924 over onto 925 when he

00:02:44.627 --> 00:02:50.757
quotes from Levi-Strauss'
introduction to the work of

00:02:50.757 --> 00:02:56.180
Marcel Mauss on the subject of
the birth,

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.639
event, or emergence of language.
 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.688
What he quotes from
Levi-Strauss would seem,

00:03:02.688 --> 00:03:06.729
on the face of it,
to have exactly the same kinds

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:11.781
of reservation and hesitation
about the emergence or birth of

00:03:11.781 --> 00:03:14.979
language that Derrida himself
has.

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:18.132
Levi-Strauss writes:
Whatever may have been the

00:03:18.132 --> 00:03:22.383
moment and the circumstances of
its appearance in the scale of

00:03:22.383 --> 00:03:25.869
animal life,
language could only have been

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:27.830
born in one fell swoop.
 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:31.930
Things could not have set about
signifying progressively.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.592
Following a transformation the
study of which is not the

00:03:35.592 --> 00:03:39.253
concern of the social sciences
but rather of biology and

00:03:39.253 --> 00:03:42.830
psychology,
a crossing over came about from

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.961
a stage where nothing had a
meaning to another where

00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:49.150
everything possessed it.
 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.639
In other words, bam!
 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.348
All of a sudden you had
language.

00:03:53.348 --> 00:03:56.831
You had a semiotic system,
whereas before,

00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:01.590
yesterday, or a minute ago you
had no language at all.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.876
In other words,
there's no notion that somehow

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:06.620
or another suddenly I looked at
something and said,

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.568
"Oh, that has a
meaning,"

00:04:08.568 --> 00:04:11.836
and then somehow or another I
looked at something else and

00:04:11.836 --> 00:04:13.223
said,
"Oh, that has a

00:04:13.223 --> 00:04:14.729
meaning,"
and in the long run,

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.677
lo and behold,
I had language--because the

00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:21.850
bringing into existence of the
very thought of meaning,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.737
Levi-Strauss wants to argue,
instantly confers meaning on

00:04:25.737 --> 00:04:26.639
everything.
 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.100
In other words,
you don't have a gradual

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.230
emergence of language.
 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.747
You have, like lava emerging
from a volcano,

00:04:35.747 --> 00:04:36.730
a rupture.
 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.916
You have something which
suddenly appears amid other

00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:45.269
things: something which is
latent in those things,

00:04:45.269 --> 00:04:49.002
although they don't in
themselves have it until you

00:04:49.002 --> 00:04:53.166
confer it on them,
namely that which confers

00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:55.139
meaning--language.
 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.730
So this is Levi-Strauss'
argument,

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.600
and Derrida is interested in it
because he recognizes its

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.750
affinity with his own hesitation
in talking about events,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.740
births, emergence and so on.
 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.211
At the same time,
he points out by way of

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:16.939
criticism that to suppose that
yesterday there was no language,

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:19.819
there were just things as they
are without meaning,

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.129
and that today there is
language--that things have

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:27.180
meaning as a result of there now
being in place that semiotic

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.661
system we call language--
he points out that this means

00:05:31.661 --> 00:05:36.529
that culture somehow or another
must come after nature.

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:40.596
There was nature;
now there is culture,

00:05:40.596 --> 00:05:45.814
which is very much like an
event or birth in the older

00:05:45.814 --> 00:05:46.699
sense.
 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.589
In fact, as soon as we have
culture--

00:05:49.589 --> 00:05:53.867
Levi-Strauss expresses this
feeling especially in a famous

00:05:53.867 --> 00:05:56.870
book called Tristes
Tropiques--

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.661
as soon as we have culture,
we begin to feel overwhelming

00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:05.144
nostalgia for nature;
but, says, Derrida,

00:06:05.144 --> 00:06:09.610
"What is this nostalgia
other than the fact that the

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.555
very thing we're nostalgic for
comes into existence as a result

00:06:14.555 --> 00:06:16.790
of the nostalgia?"
 

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.954
In other words,
there is no nature unless you

00:06:20.954 --> 00:06:23.509
have culture to think it.
 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:27.709
Nature is a meaningless concept
just like the lack of meaning

00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:30.959
within nature,
where there's no culture until

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:35.528
culture comes along and says,
"Oh, not so much there is

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.783
nature,
but I'm terribly unhappy

00:06:37.783 --> 00:06:40.920
because before I came along,
there was nature."

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.910
Right?
 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.829
This is the nostalgia or regret
of the ethnographer who says,

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:50.759
"Now as a result of this
terrible Eurocentrism,

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:54.651
as a result of the terrible
ethnocentrism of the Europeans

00:06:54.651 --> 00:06:57.754
studying these things,
we no longer have a savage

00:06:57.754 --> 00:06:58.399
mind."
 

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:02.050
That is to say,
we no longer have the kind of

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.028
mind which flourishes in nature,
in a natural environment.

00:07:07.028 --> 00:07:10.264
You can see ramifications of
arguments of this sort for

00:07:10.264 --> 00:07:13.019
environmentalism as well as for
ethnography.

00:07:13.019 --> 00:07:17.629
It's a fascinating argument,
but the bottom line is this.

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:21.000
Even this critique,
and it is a critique of

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.889
Levi-Strauss because he's
saying,

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.711
"Oh, Levi-Strauss,
that's very interesting what

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:28.185
you say about language,
but you've forgotten that this

00:07:28.185 --> 00:07:31.125
means that you yourself must
think nature preceded culture

00:07:31.125 --> 00:07:33.910
even though culture brings
nature into being."

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.202
But this very critique leveled
against Levi-Strauss,

00:07:38.202 --> 00:07:42.745
he could have found in
Levi-Strauss and does find it on

00:07:42.745 --> 00:07:44.430
other occasions.
 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.838
Levi-Strauss' famous book,
The Raw and the Cooked,

00:07:47.838 --> 00:07:51.509
essentially stages this
critique in and of itself.

00:07:51.509 --> 00:07:53.089
What do you mean,
"raw"?

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:57.870
"Well, somebody's sitting
in a field eating a carrot.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:08:00.343
That's raw,"
you say, but wait a minute:

00:08:00.343 --> 00:08:02.649
what is this notion of
"raw"?

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.964
You can't have a notion of
"raw"

00:08:04.964 --> 00:08:07.790
until you have the notion of
"cooked."

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.699
I sit in my field.
 

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:10.620
I'm eating my carrot.
 

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.810
I hold it up and I say,
"This is raw?

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.389
It's ridiculous.
 

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:17.500
'Raw' as opposed to what?"
 

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.550
Right?
 

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:20.759
So there can be no
"raw"

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:24.108
without, in a certain sense,
the prior existence of

00:08:24.108 --> 00:08:25.649
"cooked."
 

00:08:25.649 --> 00:08:28.605
"Cooked"
brings "raw"

00:08:28.605 --> 00:08:32.669
into being in exactly the way
culture brings nature into

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.408
being.
 

00:08:33.408 --> 00:08:36.168
Now to pause over this for a
moment,

00:08:36.168 --> 00:08:40.480
we realize that sort of this
basic move--

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:43.009
a move that,
when you start to think about

00:08:43.009 --> 00:08:44.837
it,
we've been encountering ever

00:08:44.837 --> 00:08:47.649
since we started reading in this
course of readings--

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:53.601
is not so much the inversion of
binaries as the calling into

00:08:53.601 --> 00:08:59.149
question of how they can exist
apart from each other.

00:08:59.149 --> 00:09:03.880
In other words,
the question of criticizing the

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:10.154
origin of one state of things
out of or after another state of

00:09:10.154 --> 00:09:13.222
things,
the process of criticizing that

00:09:13.222 --> 00:09:15.495
is basically--
and I'm sorry to be so

00:09:15.495 --> 00:09:19.150
reductive about it but I really
can't see the distortion in

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.080
saying this--
is basically saying,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.730
"Which came first,
the chicken or the egg?"

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.590
Right?
 

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:30.610
It is a declaration of absolute
interdependency among the things

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:36.154
that we understand in binary
terms but that we take somehow

00:09:36.154 --> 00:09:42.080
one to be causative of the other
when we think about them.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:46.029
This is really the basic move
of deconstruction,

00:09:46.029 --> 00:09:49.874
but it's a move which anyone
who studies philosophy as well

00:09:49.874 --> 00:09:53.320
as literary theory will
encounter again and again and

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.414
again,
all the way from Hegel right on

00:09:56.414 --> 00:10:00.991
through the post-deconstructive
thinkers we encounter for the

00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:05.586
rest of our syllabus--
perhaps preeminently among them

00:10:05.586 --> 00:10:08.620
the gender theorist Judith
Butler.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:12.280
Again and again and again you
will encounter this idea in

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:12.870
Butler.
 

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.903
It's a question of saying,
"How on earth would you

00:10:15.903 --> 00:10:18.655
ever have the concept
'heterosexual' if you didn't

00:10:18.655 --> 00:10:21.409
have the concept 'homosexual' in
place?"

00:10:21.409 --> 00:10:22.190
Right?
 

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.851
The absolute interdependency of
these concepts is,

00:10:26.851 --> 00:10:32.273
again, central to her argument
and to her understanding of

00:10:32.273 --> 00:10:33.320
things.
 

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.250
Obviously, we'll be returning
to that in the long run.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.068
Now I want to pause a little
bit more, then,

00:10:40.068 --> 00:10:44.003
in this regard over Derrida's
distinction between writing and

00:10:44.003 --> 00:10:46.428
speech--writing,
ecriture.

00:10:46.428 --> 00:10:49.979
This is a distinction which is
not meant sort of

00:10:49.979 --> 00:10:54.360
counter-intuitively to suggest
that somehow or another,

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.230
as opposed to what we usually
think,

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.519
writing precedes speech--not at
all.

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:02.759
He's not saying that we've got
it backwards.

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:08.061
He's just insisting that we
cannot understand writing to be

00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:09.250
derivative.
 

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:16.298
We cannot say writing came into
being belatedly with respect to

00:11:16.298 --> 00:11:23.350
speech in order to reproduce,
imitate, or transcribe speech.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.572
Writing and speech are
interdependent and interrelated

00:11:27.572 --> 00:11:30.600
phenomena which do different
things.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.158
Last time we spoke about
différance.

00:11:33.158 --> 00:11:36.274
We said that the difference
between deference with an

00:11:36.274 --> 00:11:38.597
e and
différance with an

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:40.129
a can't be voiced.
 

00:11:40.129 --> 00:11:43.202
It's a difference,
or différance,

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:46.340
that comes into being
precisely in writing,

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.214
and it's only in writing that
we suddenly grasp the twofold

00:11:50.214 --> 00:11:52.619
nature of
différance as

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:54.490
difference and deferral.
 

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.898
I'd like to pause a little
bit--this will be my segue to de

00:11:57.898 --> 00:12:01.106
Man--
over an interesting example in

00:12:01.106 --> 00:12:05.490
French which we don't have in
English but is,

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:09.650
I think, so instructive that
it's worth pausing over [writes

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.190
on chalkboard
"est/et"].

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.837
You remember last time--and
there is a slight voicing

00:12:14.837 --> 00:12:17.538
difference here just as there is
also a slight voicing

00:12:17.538 --> 00:12:20.472
difference: deference,
différance,

00:12:20.472 --> 00:12:22.350
but it's not a big voicing
difference.

00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:26.024
It's not something that's easy
to evoke and get across,

00:12:26.024 --> 00:12:29.019
whereas in writing it's
perfectly obvious.

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:30.447
For one thing,
the s in est,

00:12:30.447 --> 00:12:31.735
which means
"signification,"

00:12:31.735 --> 00:12:32.639
&gt;
 

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:34.865
is dropped out of this word
when you say it,

00:12:34.865 --> 00:12:35.745
est [pron.
 

00:12:35.745 --> 00:12:38.437
ay], the word for
is--which is also the

00:12:38.437 --> 00:12:41.440
pronunciation for et,
the word for and.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.111
Now these two words precisely
express in French what Derrida

00:12:46.111 --> 00:12:49.676
is trying to describe as the
double meaning of

00:12:49.676 --> 00:12:51.259
supplementarity.
 

00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:55.759
Is in the sense of the
metaphor--

00:12:55.759 --> 00:12:58.725
"This is that,
A is B,"

00:12:58.725 --> 00:13:04.620
understood as a metaphor--
is a supplement that completes

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:05.610
a whole.
 

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:10.450
It's a means of completing a
whole through the declaration

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.639
that A is B.
 

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:18.658
But is has another sense
which is not a rhetorical sense,

00:13:18.658 --> 00:13:24.418
because metaphor is sort of the
heart of rhetoric,

00:13:24.418 --> 00:13:27.509
the rhetorical sense A is
B--when, by the way,

00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:29.710
we know perfectly well that A
is not B.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:30.950
How can A be B?
 

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.120
A is only A.
 

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.409
In fact, it's even a question
whether A is A,

00:13:34.409 --> 00:13:36.179
but it's certainly not B,
right?

00:13:36.179 --> 00:13:38.158
This much we know.
 

00:13:38.158 --> 00:13:43.332
In the grammatical sense there
is no sort of mystification

00:13:43.332 --> 00:13:45.240
about the metaphor.
 

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.682
In the grammatical sense,
this word is the means or

00:13:49.682 --> 00:13:54.924
principal of predication whereby
we say one thing is another

00:13:54.924 --> 00:13:59.190
thing: the mare is the female of
the horse,

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.225
Notice that the relationship
between the rhetorical is

00:14:02.225 --> 00:14:04.881
and the grammatical
is is basically the

00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:07.918
relationship between what
Jakobson calls the "poetic

00:14:07.918 --> 00:14:10.033
function"
and the "metalingual

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:11.278
function."
 

00:14:11.278 --> 00:14:16.971
As you'll see in de Man,
there is an irreducible tension

00:14:16.971 --> 00:14:21.629
between the rhetorical sense of
this word,

00:14:21.629 --> 00:14:25.480
which claims metaphoricity,
and the grammatical sense of

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:29.003
this word,
which makes no such claim but

00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:34.230
is simply the establishment of
predication in a sentence.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.918
Now the word est or
et,

00:14:38.918 --> 00:14:43.269
which is almost like
est, reinforces the idea

00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:47.831
of the supplement,
not as the completion of

00:14:47.831 --> 00:14:52.570
something that needs it to be
complete--

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:54.928
the fulfillment of meaning in a
metaphor--

00:14:54.928 --> 00:14:57.000
but rather
"supplement"

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.368
in the sense of adding on to
something that's already

00:15:00.368 --> 00:15:01.210
complete.
 

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:06.190
The appositional,
sort of grammatical,

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.717
perpetual addition of meaning
in the expression and or

00:15:10.717 --> 00:15:14.943
et is after all very much
like what Jakobson calls

00:15:14.943 --> 00:15:18.190
"metonymic":
that is to say,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.778
the contiguous adding on of
things,

00:15:21.778 --> 00:15:25.524
making no claim to be
metaphorical just like

00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:27.788
grammatical predication.
 

00:15:27.788 --> 00:15:33.000
So the tension or the system of
differences that can be

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.597
established simply by looking at
these two similarly voiced

00:15:38.597 --> 00:15:42.123
words,
I think, gives us a kind of

00:15:42.123 --> 00:15:45.773
emblem or paradigm for what
Derrida calls

00:15:45.773 --> 00:15:50.517
"supplementarity"
and what de Man calls the

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:55.356
irreducible tension between,
difference between,

00:15:55.356 --> 00:15:59.288
and conflict between rhetoric
and grammar.

00:15:59.288 --> 00:16:05.208
That is the main topic of what
we have to say about de Man

00:16:05.208 --> 00:16:06.038
today.
 

00:16:06.038 --> 00:16:09.321
Now last time I said a little
bit about the presence of

00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:12.783
Derrida and de Man together,
together with a scholar named

00:16:12.783 --> 00:16:12.905
J.
 

00:16:12.905 --> 00:16:15.397
Hillis Miller,
and scholars who associated

00:16:15.397 --> 00:16:19.131
themselves with them--
Geoffrey Hartman and Harold

00:16:19.131 --> 00:16:23.590
Bloom--in a kind of period of
flourishing in the seventies and

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.244
early eighties at Yale called
abroad "the Yale

00:16:27.244 --> 00:16:30.312
school,"
subject to much admiration in

00:16:30.312 --> 00:16:33.820
the academy and much
vilification both within and

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:35.940
outside the academy.
 

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.107
But this was a moment of
particular and headlined

00:16:40.107 --> 00:16:44.450
notoriety in the history of
academic thinking about

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:47.740
literature,
and a moment in which academic

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.480
thinking about literature had a
peculiar influence on topics

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.509
much broader than literature.
 

00:16:53.509 --> 00:17:00.710
It began to infiltrate other
disciplines and was in general a

00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:07.190
high-spirited horse for that
certain period of time.

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:12.509
Then Miller eventually in the
eighties went to Irvine,

00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:18.140
Derrida followed him there,
and in 1983 Paul de Man died,

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:23.643
and the main force of the
movement began to give way to

00:17:23.643 --> 00:17:29.349
other interests and other
tendencies and trends both here

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:32.000
at Yale and elsewhere.
 

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.210
Then shortly after de Man's,
death there was a revelation--

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:40.571
which is mentioned by your
editor in the italicized preface

00:17:40.571 --> 00:17:42.950
to "Semiology and
Rhetoric"--

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:47.873
about de Man which was horrible
in itself and made it impossible

00:17:47.873 --> 00:17:51.858
ever to read de Man in quite the
same way again,

00:17:51.858 --> 00:17:53.259
but which was also,
I have to say,

00:17:53.259 --> 00:17:55.295
precisely what the enemies of
deconstruction were

00:17:55.295 --> 00:17:56.228
&gt;
 

00:17:56.228 --> 00:17:56.950
waiting for.
 

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:01.470
That was the fact that in his
youth,

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:06.071
de Man, still living in
Belgium, the nephew of a

00:18:06.071 --> 00:18:10.868
distinguished socialist
politician in Belgium,

00:18:10.868 --> 00:18:15.705
wrote for a Nazi-sponsored
Belgian newspaper a series of

00:18:15.705 --> 00:18:18.960
articles anti-Semitic in
tendency,

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.782
a couple of them openly
anti-Semitic or at least sort of

00:18:23.782 --> 00:18:28.328
racially Eurocentric in ways,
that argued for the exclusion

00:18:28.328 --> 00:18:31.690
of Jews from the intellectual
life of Europe and so on.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:36.463
These papers were gathered and
published as Paul de Man's

00:18:36.463 --> 00:18:40.155
wartime journalism,
and there was a tremendous

00:18:40.155 --> 00:18:43.368
furor about them similar to the
revelations,

00:18:43.368 --> 00:18:47.932
which had never been completely
repressed but grew in magnitude

00:18:47.932 --> 00:18:50.950
as more and more was known about
them--

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:54.897
the revelations about
Heidegger's association with the

00:18:54.897 --> 00:18:56.240
Nazi government.
 

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.689
In the late eighties,
there was a furious public

00:19:01.689 --> 00:19:09.108
argumentation back and forth
among those who had read de Man,

00:19:09.108 --> 00:19:13.038
those who hadn't who were
opposed to his work,

00:19:13.038 --> 00:19:17.320
and those who scrambled in one
way or another to attempt to

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.307
defend it to preserve his legacy
and also the legacy of

00:19:21.307 --> 00:19:22.710
deconstruction.
 

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:28.199
Now all of this is a matter of
record and I suppose needs to be

00:19:28.199 --> 00:19:30.588
paused over a little bit.
 

00:19:30.588 --> 00:19:33.888
One of the texts of de
Man--also in the book called

00:19:33.888 --> 00:19:37.319
Allegories of Reading
where you'll find also a

00:19:37.319 --> 00:19:39.894
version of the essay
"Semiology and

00:19:39.894 --> 00:19:42.930
Rhetoric"
that you read for today--

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.202
one of the essays that those
who had actually read de Man

00:19:46.202 --> 00:19:49.356
actually argued about in a
persistent fashion is called

00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.519
"The Purloined
Ribbon."

00:19:51.519 --> 00:19:56.971
It has to do with the passage
in Rousseau's Confessions

00:19:56.971 --> 00:20:02.156
where Rousseau has stolen a
ribbon in order to give it to a

00:20:02.156 --> 00:20:06.180
serving maid to whom he felt
attraction,

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.950
and then when he was asked who
had done it,

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:13.109
or did he know anything about
who had done it,

00:20:13.109 --> 00:20:14.910
he blurted out her name, Marion.
 

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:18.028
De Man says this really wasn't
an accusation--

00:20:18.028 --> 00:20:23.450
in fact, this was just a
meaningless word blurted out--

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:28.769
that there is no possibility
really of confession,

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:33.454
that there is no real
subjectivity that can affirm or

00:20:33.454 --> 00:20:37.779
deny guilt or responsibility:
in other words,

00:20:37.779 --> 00:20:39.788
a lot of things that,
needless to say,

00:20:39.788 --> 00:20:43.540
attracted the attention of a
public that wasn't perhaps so

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.292
much concerned that he had
written these articles but that

00:20:47.292 --> 00:20:51.769
he had never for the rest of his
career admitted having done so;

00:20:51.769 --> 00:20:54.660
in other words,
that he had suppressed a past.

00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:58.108
Nobody really believed he still
had these sympathies,

00:20:58.108 --> 00:21:01.559
but the whole question was,
why didn't he fess up?

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:02.940
Why didn't he come clean?
 

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:05.618
Of course, they took "The
Purloined Ribbon"

00:21:05.618 --> 00:21:08.401
to be his sort of allegorical
way of suggesting that he

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:11.390
couldn't possibly confess
because nobody can confess,

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:14.838
there's no human subjectivity,
etc., etc., etc.

00:21:14.838 --> 00:21:17.969
So, as I say,
there was a considerable

00:21:17.969 --> 00:21:21.690
controversy swirling around this
article,

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:28.788
and just as is the case with
Heidegger,

00:21:28.788 --> 00:21:32.902
it has been very difficult to
read de Man in the same way

00:21:32.902 --> 00:21:35.838
again as a result of what we now
know.

00:21:35.838 --> 00:21:40.068
Let me just say though also
that--and I think this was

00:21:40.068 --> 00:21:44.617
largely confessed by the people
engaged in the controversy

00:21:44.617 --> 00:21:47.890
although some people did go
farther--

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:53.994
there is no cryptically encoded
rightism either in de Man or in

00:21:53.994 --> 00:21:55.670
deconstruction.
 

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:59.528
There are two possible ways of
reacting to what deconstruction

00:21:59.528 --> 00:22:01.551
calls
"undecidability,"

00:22:01.551 --> 00:22:04.397
that is to say the
impossibility of our really

00:22:04.397 --> 00:22:08.130
being able to form a grounded
opinion about anything.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:11.336
There are two possible ways of
reacting to this,

00:22:11.336 --> 00:22:13.519
one positive and one negative.
 

00:22:13.519 --> 00:22:19.644
The negative way is to say that
undecidability opens a void in

00:22:19.644 --> 00:22:24.064
the intellect and in
consciousness into which

00:22:24.064 --> 00:22:27.680
fanaticism and tyranny can rush.
 

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:31.240
In other words,
if there is a sort of

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:36.980
considered and skillfully argued
resistance to opinion--

00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:40.038
call that
"deconstruction"--

00:22:40.038 --> 00:22:45.630
then in the absence of decently
grounded,

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:49.814
decently argued opinion,
you get this void into which

00:22:49.814 --> 00:22:52.548
fanaticism and tyranny can rush.
 

00:22:52.548 --> 00:22:56.190
That's the negative response to
undecidability,

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.750
and it's of course,
a view that many of us may

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:00.858
entertain.
 

00:23:00.858 --> 00:23:07.002
The positive reaction,
however, to undecidability is

00:23:07.002 --> 00:23:13.867
this: undecidability is a
perpetually vigilant scrutiny of

00:23:13.867 --> 00:23:20.147
all opinion as such,
precisely in order to withstand

00:23:20.147 --> 00:23:25.419
and to resist those most
egregious and incorrigible

00:23:25.419 --> 00:23:30.269
opinions of all:
the opinions of fanaticism and

00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:31.640
tyranny.
 

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:34.477
In other words,
you can take two views in

00:23:34.477 --> 00:23:37.740
effect of skepticism:
&gt;

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.667
the one that it is,
in its insistence on a lack of

00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:47.998
foundation for opinion,
a kind of passive acquiescence

00:23:47.998 --> 00:23:51.720
in whatever rises up in its
face;

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.311
and on the other hand,
you can argue that without

00:23:55.311 --> 00:23:58.392
skepticism,
everybody is vulnerable to

00:23:58.392 --> 00:24:03.210
excessive commitment to opinion,
which is precisely the thing

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:06.220
that skepticism is supposed to
resist.

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:10.635
Now this isn't the first time
in this course that I've paused

00:24:10.635 --> 00:24:14.905
over a moment at a crossroads
where you can't possibly take

00:24:14.905 --> 00:24:17.630
both paths
&gt;

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:23.442
but where it is obviously very,
very difficult to make up one's

00:24:23.442 --> 00:24:24.098
mind.
 

00:24:24.098 --> 00:24:30.740
More than one can say or care
to admit, it may ultimately be a

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:36.730
matter of temperament which path
one chooses to take.

00:24:36.730 --> 00:24:37.700
All right.
 

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.195
Now in any case,
while we're on the subject of

00:24:40.195 --> 00:24:43.470
deconstruction in general and
before we get into de Man,

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:46.608
let me just say that there is
one other way,

00:24:46.608 --> 00:24:50.598
if I may, not to criticize
deconstruction.

00:24:50.598 --> 00:24:56.157
It's always supposed popularly
that deconstruction denies the

00:24:56.157 --> 00:25:00.048
existence of any reality outside
a text.

00:25:00.048 --> 00:25:01.886
Derrida famously,
notoriously,

00:25:01.886 --> 00:25:05.056
said "there is nothing
outside the text,"

00:25:05.056 --> 00:25:05.690
right?
 

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.282
What he meant by that,
of course, is that there's

00:25:08.282 --> 00:25:09.308
nothing but text.
 

00:25:09.308 --> 00:25:12.480
That is to say,
the entire tissue,

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.992
structure,
and nature of our

00:25:14.992 --> 00:25:20.028
lives--including history,
which we know textually is all

00:25:20.028 --> 00:25:24.230
there is--
our lives are textual lives.

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.880
That's what he meant.
 

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.013
He didn't mean to say the text
is here, the text contains

00:25:28.013 --> 00:25:31.259
everything that matters,
and nothing else exists anyway.

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:34.544
What he meant to say is that
there is "nothing but

00:25:34.544 --> 00:25:37.705
text" in the sense that
absolutely everything we

00:25:37.705 --> 00:25:41.173
ordinarily take to be just our
kind of spontaneously lived

00:25:41.173 --> 00:25:44.064
existence is,
in fact, mediated in the ways

00:25:44.064 --> 00:25:47.009
we've already discussed at
length in this course,

00:25:47.009 --> 00:25:51.116
and we'll discuss more by our
knowledge and that our knowledge

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:52.868
is textual,
right?

00:25:52.868 --> 00:25:54.798
That's what he meant but,
as I say,

00:25:54.798 --> 00:25:59.497
it's widely misunderstood,
and de Man in the fourth

00:25:59.497 --> 00:26:05.416
passage on your sheet returns to
the attack against this popular

00:26:05.416 --> 00:26:10.715
supposition and says:
In genuine semiology as well as

00:26:10.715 --> 00:26:14.769
in other linguistically oriented
theories,

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:19.489
the referential [and notice the
citation of Jakobson here]

00:26:19.489 --> 00:26:23.049
function of language is not
being denied.

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:23.890
Far from it.
 

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:27.250
[In other words,
it's not a question of the

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:29.730
idealist who was refuted by Dr.
 

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:34.368
Johnson who kicked a stone and
leaped away in terrible pain

00:26:34.368 --> 00:26:37.019
saying,
"I refute it thus."

00:26:37.019 --> 00:26:40.680
Nobody denies the existence of
the stone, right?

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.900
That is not at all the case.
 

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:49.740
Reality is there,
reality is what it is,

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:55.140
and the referential function is
perpetually in play in language,

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.365
trying to hook on to that
reality.]

00:26:59.365 --> 00:27:05.582
What is in question is its
authority for natural or

00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:08.690
phenomenal cognition.
 

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.544
[That is to say,
can we know what things

00:27:12.544 --> 00:27:17.780
are--not that things are but
what things are using the

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.450
instrument of language?
 

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:24.087
De Man goes on to say very
challengingly:]

00:27:24.087 --> 00:27:28.526
What we call ideology is
precisely the confusion of

00:27:28.526 --> 00:27:34.900
linguistic with natural reality,
of reference with phenomenalism.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:38.763
[In other words,
ideology is nothing other than

00:27:38.763 --> 00:27:43.133
the belief that language,
my language--what I say and

00:27:43.133 --> 00:27:46.828
what I think in language--speaks
true.]

00:27:46.828 --> 00:27:52.398
That's the position taken up,
not at all the same thing as

00:27:52.398 --> 00:27:58.750
saying what's out there doesn't
exist--nothing to do with that.

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:01.519
All right.
 

00:28:01.519 --> 00:28:05.318
Now de Man's early career was
influenced--

00:28:05.318 --> 00:28:08.777
I'm not speaking of the very
early career in which he wrote

00:28:08.777 --> 00:28:11.868
these articles,
but the early career involving

00:28:11.868 --> 00:28:15.369
the essays which were collected
in his first book,

00:28:15.369 --> 00:28:17.058
Blindness and Insight.
 

00:28:17.058 --> 00:28:19.761
His early career is mainly
influenced by French

00:28:19.761 --> 00:28:22.676
intellectualism,
in particular Jean-Paul

00:28:22.676 --> 00:28:25.960
Sartre's Being and
Nothingness,

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:30.810
and the argument of
Blindness and Insight is

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:36.826
largely to be understood not so
much in terms of de Man's later

00:28:36.826 --> 00:28:42.356
preoccupations with linguistics
as with the negotiation of

00:28:42.356 --> 00:28:48.470
Sartre and existentialism into a
kind of literary theory.

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:52.198
The texts, in particular the
text called "Criticism and

00:28:52.198 --> 00:28:54.480
Crisis"--
the first one that I quote on

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.390
your sheet--
can best be read in those terms;

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:02.703
but soon enough,
de Man did accept and embrace

00:29:02.703 --> 00:29:08.650
the influence of Saussure in
linguistics and structuralism,

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:12.740
and his vocabulary henceforth
took these forms.

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.800
The vocabulary that we have to
wrestle with for today's essay

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.319
is taken in part from Jakobson's
understanding of the

00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:23.568
relationship between metaphor
and metonymy,

00:29:23.568 --> 00:29:27.019
and we will have more to say
about that.

00:29:27.019 --> 00:29:31.410
But in the meantime it's
probably on this occasion,

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.314
once we accept them both as
having come under the influence

00:29:35.314 --> 00:29:38.210
of the same form of linguistic
thinking,

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:42.940
to say a little bit about the
similarities and differences

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.259
that exist between Derrida and
de Man.

00:29:46.259 --> 00:29:50.692
Now similarly,
they both take for granted that

00:29:50.692 --> 00:29:55.618
it is very difficult to think
about beginnings,

00:29:55.618 --> 00:29:59.279
but at the same time,
one has to have some way,

00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:03.715
some proto-structuralist way,
of understanding that before a

00:30:03.715 --> 00:30:06.009
certain moment--
that is to say,

00:30:06.009 --> 00:30:08.769
before a certain synchronic
cross-section--

00:30:08.769 --> 00:30:13.179
things were different from the
way they were in some successive

00:30:13.179 --> 00:30:13.818
moment.
 

00:30:13.818 --> 00:30:16.873
So in the second passage on
your sheet to which I'll return

00:30:16.873 --> 00:30:19.233
in the end,
we find de Man saying,

00:30:19.233 --> 00:30:23.001
"Literary theory can be
said to come into being

00:30:23.001 --> 00:30:30.516
when"--
that is de Man's version of the

00:30:30.516 --> 00:30:34.107
event,
and he agrees with Derrida in

00:30:34.107 --> 00:30:37.150
saying,
"Well, sure God came into

00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.559
being;
man came into being;

00:30:38.559 --> 00:30:40.038
consciousness came into being.
 

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:42.404
That's all very well,
but they're just head

00:30:42.404 --> 00:30:43.980
signifiers in metaphysics.
 

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:46.309
There's something different
about language."

00:30:46.309 --> 00:30:47.440
Right?
 

00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.405
What both Derrida and de Man
say about the difference when

00:30:52.405 --> 00:30:56.240
one thinks of language coming
into being,

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.430
from thinking about all those
other things coming into being,

00:30:59.430 --> 00:31:03.810
is that language does not
purport to stand outside of

00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:04.568
itself.
 

00:31:04.568 --> 00:31:07.210
It cannot stand outside of
itself.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.078
It cannot constitute itself.
 

00:31:10.078 --> 00:31:14.940
It is perpetually caught up in
its own systematic nature so

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.700
that it's a center.
 

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:21.617
We have to resist excessive
commitment to this idea of it

00:31:21.617 --> 00:31:25.432
being a center,
but it is at least not a center

00:31:25.432 --> 00:31:29.825
which somehow stands outside of
itself and is a center only in

00:31:29.825 --> 00:31:32.490
the sense that it is some
remote,

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:35.618
hidden, impersonal,
distant cause.

00:31:35.618 --> 00:31:42.310
Language is caught up in itself
in a way that all of these other

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.328
moments were not.
 

00:31:44.328 --> 00:31:49.689
Then also, I think that you can
see the similarity to Derrida

00:31:49.689 --> 00:31:54.779
and de Man's way of insisting on
these binary relations as

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:59.556
interdependent and mutual,
comparable to the sort of thing

00:31:59.556 --> 00:32:02.210
that I've been talking about in
Derrida.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:10.808
Take page 891 and 892 for
example, the very bottom of 891

00:32:10.808 --> 00:32:12.960
over to 892.
 

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.409
De Man says:
It is easy enough to see that

00:32:16.409 --> 00:32:20.577
this apparent glorification of
the critic-philosopher in the

00:32:20.577 --> 00:32:24.675
name of truth is in fact a
glorification of the poet as the

00:32:24.675 --> 00:32:27.220
primary source of this truth...
 

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:30.108
Now he does not mean,
as Freud, for example,

00:32:30.108 --> 00:32:32.669
meant in saying,
"The poets came before me

00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:36.119
and the poets knew everything I
knew before I knew it."

00:32:36.119 --> 00:32:38.078
He does not mean that at all.
 

00:32:38.078 --> 00:32:41.640
What he means is what he says
in the following clauses.

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:46.278
[I]f truth is the recognition
of the systematic character of a

00:32:46.278 --> 00:32:49.923
certain kind of error,
then it would be fully

00:32:49.923 --> 00:32:53.730
dependent on the prior existence
of this error.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.450
In other words,
truth arises out of error.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:32:59.339
Error is not a deviance from
truth.

00:32:59.339 --> 00:33:00.500
Right?
 

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.233
Error is not a poetic
elaboration on things which

00:33:04.233 --> 00:33:07.182
somehow,
as it does in Plato's view,

00:33:07.182 --> 00:33:11.138
undermines the integrity of
that truth identified by

00:33:11.138 --> 00:33:12.380
philosophers.
 

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:16.628
On the contrary,
philosophy properly understood

00:33:16.628 --> 00:33:21.247
is what comes into being when
one has achieved full

00:33:21.247 --> 00:33:24.848
recognition of a preexisting
error.

00:33:24.848 --> 00:33:29.367
That is the way in which de Man
wants to think about the

00:33:29.367 --> 00:33:34.215
relationship precisely between
literature and other forms of

00:33:34.215 --> 00:33:35.118
speech.
 

00:33:35.118 --> 00:33:38.317
In saying that,
I want to move immediately to

00:33:38.317 --> 00:33:40.568
the differences with Derrida.
 

00:33:40.568 --> 00:33:45.358
Derrida, as I said,
believes in a kind of seamless

00:33:45.358 --> 00:33:48.779
web of discourse or
discursivity.

00:33:48.779 --> 00:33:51.690
We are awash in discourse.
 

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:56.001
Yes, we can provisionally or
heuristically speak of one form

00:33:56.001 --> 00:33:58.779
of discourse as opposed to
another--

00:33:58.779 --> 00:34:03.750
literature, law,
theology, science and so on--

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:09.230
but it is all easily undermined
and demystified as something

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:12.760
that has real independent
integrity.

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.809
De Man does not believe this.
 

00:34:14.809 --> 00:34:17.822
De Man thinks,
on the contrary,

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:22.340
that there is such a thing as
literariness.

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:27.974
He follows Jakobson much more
consistently in this regard than

00:34:27.974 --> 00:34:29.360
Derrida does.
 

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:37.099
Again and again he says that
the important thing is to insist

00:34:37.099 --> 00:34:44.063
on the difference between
literature and other forms of

00:34:44.063 --> 00:34:45.869
discourse.
 

00:34:45.869 --> 00:34:52.010
There are all kinds of passages
I could elicit in support of

00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.739
this.
 

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:55.590
Let me just quickly read a few,
page 883,

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:06.380
about two thirds of the way
down the left-hand column,

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:12.025
where he's sounds very much
like a Russian formalist talking

00:35:12.025 --> 00:35:15.704
about the what literature,
in particular,

00:35:15.704 --> 00:35:19.449
has exclusively that other
forms of discourse don't have.

00:35:19.449 --> 00:35:22.557
He says: â€¦
[L]iterature cannot merely be

00:35:22.557 --> 00:35:26.681
received as a definite unit of
referential meaning that can be

00:35:26.681 --> 00:35:29.250
decoded without leaving a
residue.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.255
The code is unusually
conspicuous, complex,

00:35:32.255 --> 00:35:34.855
and enigmatic;
it attracts an inordinate

00:35:34.855 --> 00:35:38.057
amount of attention to itself,
and this attention has to

00:35:38.057 --> 00:35:39.980
acquire the rigor of a method.
 

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:43.494
The structural moment of
concentration on the code for

00:35:43.494 --> 00:35:47.275
its own sake cannot be avoided,
and literature necessarily

00:35:47.275 --> 00:35:49.199
breeds its own formalism.
 

00:35:49.199 --> 00:35:52.206
In the interest of time,
I'm going to skip over a few

00:35:52.206 --> 00:35:55.791
other passages that I was going
to read to you in reinforcement

00:35:55.791 --> 00:35:58.541
of this insistence,
on de Man's part,

00:35:58.541 --> 00:36:03.030
that literature differs from
other forms of discourse,

00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:06.536
the remaining question being:
literature differs from other

00:36:06.536 --> 00:36:08.050
forms of discourse how?
 

00:36:08.050 --> 00:36:14.041
Well, it is the disclosure of
error that other forms of

00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:20.144
discourse supposing themselves
to refer to things remain

00:36:20.144 --> 00:36:21.809
unaware of.
 

00:36:21.809 --> 00:36:25.780
Literature knows itself to be
fictive.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:30.452
Ultimately, we reach the
conclusion that if we're to

00:36:30.452 --> 00:36:34.184
think of literature,
we're to think of something

00:36:34.184 --> 00:36:36.952
that is made up:
not something that is based on

00:36:36.952 --> 00:36:39.539
something but something that is
made up.

00:36:39.539 --> 00:36:42.467
In the first passage,
the statement about language by

00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:45.480
criticism,
that sign and meaning can never

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.239
coincide,
is what is precisely taken for

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:52.268
granted in the kind of language
we call "literary."

00:36:52.268 --> 00:36:56.885
Literature, unlike everyday
language, begins on the far side

00:36:56.885 --> 00:36:58.449
of this knowledge.
 

00:36:58.449 --> 00:37:02.885
It is the only form of
knowledge free from the fallacy

00:37:02.885 --> 00:37:06.177
of unmediated expression--
in other words,

00:37:06.177 --> 00:37:10.161
free from the fallacy that when
I say "It is raining,"

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:13.639
I mean I'm a meteorologist and
I mean it is raining.

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:17.009
Literature, when it says
"It is raining,"

00:37:17.009 --> 00:37:19.840
is not looking out of the
window, right?

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.599
This is after all perfectly
true.

00:37:22.599 --> 00:37:25.018
The author may have been
looking out of the window,

00:37:25.018 --> 00:37:26.179
&gt;
 

00:37:26.179 --> 00:37:29.159
but literature,
as we encounter it and as a

00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:32.070
text, is not looking out of the
window.

00:37:32.070 --> 00:37:33.429
How can a text look out of the
window?

00:37:33.429 --> 00:37:36.663
When literature says "It
is raining,"

00:37:36.663 --> 00:37:39.545
it's got something else,
as one might say,

00:37:39.545 --> 00:37:42.440
in view:
All of us [de Man continues]

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.331
know this although we know it
in the misleading way of a

00:37:46.331 --> 00:37:49.018
wishful assertion of the
opposite,

00:37:49.018 --> 00:37:53.860
yet the truth emerges in the
foreknowledge we possess of the

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.699
true nature of literature when
we refer to it as fiction.

00:37:58.699 --> 00:38:03.228
This is why in the last passage
on your sheet from the interview

00:38:03.228 --> 00:38:07.293
with Stefano Rosso,
de Man is willing to venture on

00:38:07.293 --> 00:38:11.862
a categorical distinction
between his own work and that of

00:38:11.862 --> 00:38:15.230
his very close friend,
Jacques Derrida.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:21.922
He says: I have a tendency to
put upon texts [and he means

00:38:21.922 --> 00:38:27.206
literary texts]
an inherent authority which is

00:38:27.206 --> 00:38:30.393
stronger,
I think, than Derrida is

00:38:30.393 --> 00:38:31.940
willing to put on them.
 

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:35.599
In a complicated way,
I would hold to the statement

00:38:35.599 --> 00:38:39.480
that the text deconstructs
itself [In other words,

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:43.869
literature is the perpetual
denial of its referentiality],

00:38:43.869 --> 00:38:49.554
is self-deconstructive rather
than being deconstructed by a

00:38:49.554 --> 00:38:55.730
philosophical intervention [that
which Jacques Derrida does--

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:59.264
that is to say,
Jacques Derrida bringing his

00:38:59.264 --> 00:39:04.112
sort of delicate sledgehammer
down on every conceivable form

00:39:04.112 --> 00:39:08.871
of utterance from the outside--
right--rather than being

00:39:08.871 --> 00:39:13.653
deconstructed by a philosophical
intervention from outside the

00:39:13.653 --> 00:39:14.360
text].
 

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:20.284
So those are some remarks then
on the differences and the

00:39:20.284 --> 00:39:24.730
similarities between de Man and
Derrida.

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.280
Now "Semiology and
Rhetoric"

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.661
historically comes near the end
of the period that

00:39:30.661 --> 00:39:33.425
"Structure,
Sign, and Play"

00:39:33.425 --> 00:39:34.280
inaugurates.
 

00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:37.467
That is to say,
it is published in

00:39:37.467 --> 00:39:43.648
Allegories of Reading and
is a text which we can date from

00:39:43.648 --> 00:39:45.579
the early 1980s.
 

00:39:45.579 --> 00:39:50.143
Well, it was published
originally as an article in

00:39:50.143 --> 00:39:52.996
1979,
but this is also near the end

00:39:52.996 --> 00:39:57.500
of a period of flourishing that
Derrida's essay inaugurates,

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:02.710
and other things have begun to
become crucial.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:06.380
Even before the death of de Man
and the revelations about his

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:08.215
past,
there were a lot of people sort

00:40:08.215 --> 00:40:09.780
of shaking their fists and
saying,

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:11.210
"What about history?
 

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:12.849
What about reality?"
 

00:40:12.849 --> 00:40:16.826
I've already suggested that in
a variety of ways this is a

00:40:16.826 --> 00:40:21.221
response that can be naïve
but it is still very much in the

00:40:21.221 --> 00:40:21.780
air.
 

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:27.485
De Man says in this atmosphere
of response--at the top of page

00:40:27.485 --> 00:40:31.039
883, the left-hand column,
he says:

00:40:31.039 --> 00:40:34.181
We speak as if,
with the problems of literary

00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:37.896
form resolved once and forever
and with techniques of

00:40:37.896 --> 00:40:41.610
structural analysis refined to
near-perfection,

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:44.322
we could now move "beyond
formalism"

00:40:44.322 --> 00:40:47.760
toward the questions that
really interest us and reap,

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:51.512
at last, the fruits of the
aesthetic concentration on

00:40:51.512 --> 00:40:55.340
techniques that prepared us for
this decisive step.

00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:59.322
Obviously, I think by this time
you can realize what he's saying

00:40:59.322 --> 00:41:03.179
is if we make this move,
if we move beyond formalism,

00:41:03.179 --> 00:41:07.864
we have forgotten the cardinal
rule of the Russian formalists:

00:41:07.864 --> 00:41:09.889
namely,
that there's no distinction

00:41:09.889 --> 00:41:12.297
between form and content--
in other words,

00:41:12.297 --> 00:41:17.128
that we in effect can't move
beyond formalism and that it is

00:41:17.128 --> 00:41:21.469
simply a procedurally mistaken
notion that we can.

00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:25.217
That's the position,
of course, pursued in this

00:41:25.217 --> 00:41:25.869
essay.
 

00:41:25.869 --> 00:41:31.289
The task of the essay is to
deny the complementarity--

00:41:31.289 --> 00:41:36.050
the mutual reinforcement even
in rigorous rhetorical analysis

00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:40.451
like that of Gerard Genette,
Todorov, Barthes and others,

00:41:40.451 --> 00:41:43.987
all of whom he says have
regressed from the rigor of

00:41:43.987 --> 00:41:47.447
Jakobson--
to deny that in rhetorical

00:41:47.447 --> 00:41:52.860
analysis rhetorical and
grammatical aspects of discourse

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:58.677
can be considered collusive,
continuous, or cooperative with

00:41:58.677 --> 00:41:59.710
each other.
 

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:05.072
Now I've already suggested the
problems that arise when you

00:42:05.072 --> 00:42:09.050
consider this term even in and
of itself.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:15.262
I'm actually ripping off,
by the way, an essay of Jacques

00:42:15.262 --> 00:42:19.922
Derrida's called,
hm &gt;

00:42:19.922 --> 00:42:23.030
&gt;
 

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:26.000
-- anyway, it's that essay and
&gt;

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.224
now you'll never know my
source.

00:42:28.224 --> 00:42:30.090
&gt;
 

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.559
In any case,
Derrida, too,

00:42:32.559 --> 00:42:36.612
in this essay which
&gt;

00:42:36.612 --> 00:42:39.380
&gt;
 

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:44.351
is at pains to argue that you
can't reduce grammar to rhetoric

00:42:44.351 --> 00:42:46.389
or rhetoric to grammar.
 

00:42:46.389 --> 00:42:49.931
So as we think about these
things as I suggest,

00:42:49.931 --> 00:42:54.320
we've already introduced what
de Man drives home to us.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:56.400
He says, "Boy,
this is complicated theory.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.469
I'm in over my head,
so I better just get practical

00:42:59.469 --> 00:43:02.539
and give you some examples of
what I mean."

00:43:02.539 --> 00:43:09.798
So he takes up "All in the
Family" and talks about the

00:43:09.798 --> 00:43:16.943
moment in which Archie becomes
exasperated when Edith begins to

00:43:16.943 --> 00:43:23.856
tell him that the difference
between bowling shoes laced over

00:43:23.856 --> 00:43:30.001
and bowling shoes laced under--
this in response to Archie's

00:43:30.001 --> 00:43:31.351
question,
"What's the

00:43:31.351 --> 00:43:32.039
difference?"
 

00:43:32.039 --> 00:43:35.784
In other words,
Archie has asked a rhetorical

00:43:35.784 --> 00:43:36.719
question.
 

00:43:36.719 --> 00:43:38.958
"I don't care what the
difference is"

00:43:38.958 --> 00:43:41.099
is the meaning of the
rhetorical question.

00:43:41.099 --> 00:43:45.449
Edith, a reader of sublime
simplicity,

00:43:45.449 --> 00:43:48.092
as de Man says,
misinterprets the rhetorical

00:43:48.092 --> 00:43:51.288
question as a grammatical
question: "What is the

00:43:51.288 --> 00:43:52.210
difference?
 

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:53.500
I'm curious to know."
 

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.576
Then she proceeds to explain
that there's lacing over,

00:43:56.576 --> 00:43:58.492
on the one hand,
and lacing under,

00:43:58.492 --> 00:43:59.768
on the other hand.
 

00:43:59.768 --> 00:44:03.577
Archie, of course,
can't stand this because for

00:44:03.577 --> 00:44:08.132
him it's perfectly clear that a
rhetorical question is a

00:44:08.132 --> 00:44:10.119
rhetorical question.
 

00:44:10.119 --> 00:44:14.693
De Man's point is a question is
both rhetorical and grammatical,

00:44:14.693 --> 00:44:17.960
and the one cannot be reduced
to the other.

00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:19.360
Both readings are available.
 

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.849
He complicates,
without changing the argument,

00:44:21.849 --> 00:44:24.451
by then referring to Yeats'
poem "Among

00:44:24.451 --> 00:44:27.780
Schoolchildren,"
which culminates you remember--

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:31.619
it has a whole series of
metaphors of attempting,

00:44:31.619 --> 00:44:35.789
seeming at least to attempt,
the synthesis of opposites

00:44:35.789 --> 00:44:40.114
concluding: "how can we can
tell the dancer from the

00:44:40.114 --> 00:44:41.349
dance?"
 

00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:43.309
Another question, right?
 

00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:48.690
Now the rhetorical question
completes the usual reading of

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:49.730
the poem.
 

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:53.215
The answer to the rhetorical
question is that we can't tell

00:44:53.215 --> 00:44:56.219
the difference between the
dancer and the dance.

00:44:56.219 --> 00:45:01.250
They are unified in a
synthetic, symbolizing,

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.630
symbolic moment that
constitutes the work of art,

00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:10.391
and all the preceding metaphors
lead up to this triumphant sense

00:45:10.391 --> 00:45:12.652
of unity,
of symbolic unity,

00:45:12.652 --> 00:45:14.980
as the essence of the work of
art--

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:18.239
a unity which,
by the way, entails among other

00:45:18.239 --> 00:45:22.440
things the unity of author and
text: the unity of agent and

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.168
production,
the unity of all of those

00:45:25.168 --> 00:45:27.184
things which,
as we've seen,

00:45:27.184 --> 00:45:31.018
much literary theory is
interested in collapsing.

00:45:31.018 --> 00:45:33.260
How can we tell the dancer from
the dance?

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.050
Well, de Man says,
"Wait a minute though.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:36.619
This is also a grammatical
question."

00:45:36.619 --> 00:45:39.019
If you stop and think of it as
a grammatical question,

00:45:39.019 --> 00:45:41.012
you say to yourself,
"Gee, that's a very

00:45:41.012 --> 00:45:42.190
&gt;
 

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.094
good question,
isn't it, because,

00:45:44.094 --> 00:45:47.788
of course, the easiest thing in
the world is to tell the dancer

00:45:47.788 --> 00:45:48.681
from the dance.
 

00:45:48.681 --> 00:45:50.289
&gt;
 

00:45:50.289 --> 00:45:52.422
I am the dancer and this is the
dance I am doing and

00:45:52.422 --> 00:45:53.510
&gt;
 

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:57.900
obviously they're not the same
thing," right?

00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:59.980
What nonsense poetry speaks.
 

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.719
It's perfectly ridiculous.
 

00:46:01.719 --> 00:46:07.197
There is also a grammatical
sense which won't go away just

00:46:07.197 --> 00:46:11.809
because your rigorous,
sort of symbolic interpretation

00:46:11.809 --> 00:46:14.590
insists that it should go away,
right?

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:17.226
Then de Man,
who happens to be a Yeats

00:46:17.226 --> 00:46:20.335
scholar--
he published a dissertation on

00:46:20.335 --> 00:46:23.050
Yeats and really knows his
Yeats--

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:28.326
starts adducing examples from
all over the canon of Yeats to

00:46:28.326 --> 00:46:32.351
the effect that Yeats is
perfectly knowing and

00:46:32.351 --> 00:46:37.360
self-conscious about these
grammatical differences,

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.775
and that there is a measure of
irony in the poem that saves it

00:46:42.775 --> 00:46:46.860
from this sort of symbolizing
mystification.

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:51.434
He makes a perfectly plausible
argument to the effect that the

00:46:51.434 --> 00:46:55.110
question is grammatical rather
than rhetorical.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:59.771
He's not claiming--and he
points this out to us--that his

00:46:59.771 --> 00:47:02.269
explication is the true one.
 

00:47:02.269 --> 00:47:04.199
That's not his point at all.
 

00:47:04.199 --> 00:47:08.494
He's claiming only that it is
available and can be adduced

00:47:08.494 --> 00:47:11.280
from what we call
"evidence"

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.349
in the same way that the
symbolic interpretation,

00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:19.202
based on the rhetorical
question, is available and can

00:47:19.202 --> 00:47:23.389
be adduced from evidence--
and that these two viewpoints

00:47:23.389 --> 00:47:24.650
are irreducible.
 

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:28.706
They cannot be reconciled as
traditional students of the

00:47:28.706 --> 00:47:32.836
relationship between rhetoric
and grammar in studying the

00:47:32.836 --> 00:47:36.967
rhetorical and grammatical
effects of literature take for

00:47:36.967 --> 00:47:38.000
granted.
 

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.079
That's his argument.
 

00:47:39.079 --> 00:47:42.617
It's a kind of infighting
because he's talking about two

00:47:42.617 --> 00:47:45.449
people who are actually very
close allies.

00:47:45.449 --> 00:47:49.405
He's saying they're doing great
work but they forget this one

00:47:49.405 --> 00:47:52.175
little thing:
you cannot reconcile rhetoric

00:47:52.175 --> 00:47:53.230
and grammar.
 

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:56.519
Every sentence is a
predication, and if every

00:47:56.519 --> 00:48:00.706
sentence is a predication,
it also has the structure of a

00:48:00.706 --> 00:48:03.829
metaphor;
and the metaphor in a sentence

00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:07.771
and the predication in a
sentence are always going to be

00:48:07.771 --> 00:48:08.559
at odds.
 

00:48:08.559 --> 00:48:12.230
A metaphor is what we call a
poetic lie.

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:15.650
Everybody knows A is not B.
 

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.001
A predication,
on the other hand,

00:48:18.001 --> 00:48:22.119
usually goes forward in the
service of referentiality.

00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:24.929
It's a truth claim of some
kind--right?--

00:48:24.929 --> 00:48:28.775
but if rhetoricity and
grammaticality coexist in any

00:48:28.775 --> 00:48:31.855
sentence,
the sentence's truth claim and

00:48:31.855 --> 00:48:35.409
its lie are perpetually at odds
with each other.

00:48:35.409 --> 00:48:38.268
Just taking the sentence as a
sentence,

00:48:38.268 --> 00:48:42.565
irrespective of any kind of
inference we might make about

00:48:42.565 --> 00:48:45.358
intentions--
we know perfectly well what

00:48:45.358 --> 00:48:48.289
Edith intends and what Archie
Bunker intends.

00:48:48.289 --> 00:48:50.777
It's not as if we're confused
about the meaning of what

00:48:50.777 --> 00:48:51.559
they're saying.
 

00:48:51.559 --> 00:48:55.079
It's just that other meanings
are available,

00:48:55.079 --> 00:48:56.989
and since they're not on the
same page,

00:48:56.989 --> 00:49:00.503
those two other meanings
coexist painfully and

00:49:00.503 --> 00:49:02.768
irreducibly at odds,
right?

00:49:02.768 --> 00:49:07.672
But there are cases--suppose
Archie Bunker were Arkay

00:49:07.672 --> 00:49:08.710
Debunker.
 

00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:12.820
Suppose Archie Bunker were
Jacques Derrida,

00:49:12.820 --> 00:49:15.590
and Jacques Derrida came along
and said,

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:17.789
"What is the
différance?"

00:49:17.789 --> 00:49:18.230
Right? &gt;
 

00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:21.389
That would be an entirely
different matter,

00:49:21.389 --> 00:49:23.300
wouldn't it,
because you would have

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:26.447
absolutely no idea whether the
question was rhetorical or

00:49:26.447 --> 00:49:27.739
grammatical, right?
 

00:49:27.739 --> 00:49:31.829
There it wouldn't be possible
to invoke an intention because

00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:35.574
the whole complication of
Derrida is precisely to raise

00:49:35.574 --> 00:49:39.751
the question about not knowing,
not being able to voice the

00:49:39.751 --> 00:49:42.615
différance between
difference and

00:49:42.615 --> 00:49:46.539
différance and not
knowing whether Archie is right

00:49:46.539 --> 00:49:48.469
or whether Edith is right.
 

00:49:48.469 --> 00:49:55.190
Proust I don't have time for,
but it's a marvelous reading of

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:59.110
that wonderful passage in
which--

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:02.815
remember that he's set it up at
the beginning of the essay with

00:50:02.815 --> 00:50:05.670
a kind of wonderful,
cunning sort of sense of

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:09.188
structure by talking about the
grandmother in Proust who's

00:50:09.188 --> 00:50:12.768
always driving Marcel out into
the garden because she can't

00:50:12.768 --> 00:50:15.360
stand the interiority of his
reading.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:19.355
Well, later on in the essay de
Man quotes this wonderful

00:50:19.355 --> 00:50:23.277
passage in which Marcel talks
about the way in which he

00:50:23.277 --> 00:50:27.637
brought the outside inside as he
was perpetually conscious of

00:50:27.637 --> 00:50:32.213
everything that was going on out
there during the process of his

00:50:32.213 --> 00:50:35.213
reading,
so that ultimately in the

00:50:35.213 --> 00:50:38.800
charmed moment of his reading,
there was no difference between

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.659
inside and outside.
 

00:50:39.659 --> 00:50:42.610
In other words,
a metaphor, a rhetorical

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.471
understanding of the
relationship between inside and

00:50:46.471 --> 00:50:51.302
outside has been accomplished,
but then grammatical analysis

00:50:51.302 --> 00:50:55.820
shows that the whole structure
of the passage is additive--

00:50:55.820 --> 00:51:01.211
that is, adding things on--and
is complicating and reinforcing

00:51:01.211 --> 00:51:05.190
an argument without insisting on
identity,

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:09.210
on the underlying identity on
which metaphor depends;

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.289
so he calls this metonymic.
 

00:51:11.289 --> 00:51:16.019
By the way, I'm going to leave
also to your sections the

00:51:16.019 --> 00:51:21.440
strange confusion that ensues in
taking a rhetorical device,

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:25.431
metonymy, and making it
synonymous with grammar on the

00:51:25.431 --> 00:51:27.090
axis of combination.
 

00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.369
I leave that to your sections.
 

00:51:28.369 --> 00:51:30.157
In the meantime he says,
"No, no,

00:51:30.157 --> 00:51:30.639
no then.
 

00:51:30.639 --> 00:51:33.260
I guess this passage isn't
rhetorical after all.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.909
It must be metonymic--but wait!
 

00:51:34.909 --> 00:51:37.050
It is spoken by a voice.
 

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:40.753
There is this wonderful
overarching voice that unifies

00:51:40.753 --> 00:51:42.360
everything after all.
 

00:51:42.360 --> 00:51:44.931
This is what I call,"
says de Man,

00:51:44.931 --> 00:51:48.719
"the rhetoricization of
grammar, right--but wait!

00:51:48.719 --> 00:51:50.730
That voice is not the author.
 

00:51:50.730 --> 00:51:52.610
That voice is a speaker.
 

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:58.411
That voice is Marcel performing
his wonderful sort of metaphoric

00:51:58.411 --> 00:52:01.706
magic,
but we know that the author is

00:52:01.706 --> 00:52:06.313
painstakingly putting this
together in the most laborious

00:52:06.313 --> 00:52:10.293
kind of composed way,
making something up in an

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:13.449
additive way that's not
rhetorical at all;

00:52:13.449 --> 00:52:14.989
it's grammatical.
 

00:52:14.989 --> 00:52:19.192
This is a supreme writer
putting together long sentences

00:52:19.192 --> 00:52:20.949
and so wait a minute.
 

00:52:20.949 --> 00:52:23.619
It must be, after all,
a grammaticization of

00:52:23.619 --> 00:52:26.226
rhetoric,"
the whole point of which is

00:52:26.226 --> 00:52:29.329
that the worm of interpretation
keeps turning.

00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:30.239
All right?
 

00:52:30.239 --> 00:52:34.679
It doesn't arbitrarily stop
anywhere because rhetoric and

00:52:34.679 --> 00:52:36.980
grammar remain irreducible.
 

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:41.141
We have to keep thinking of
them as being uncooperative with

00:52:41.141 --> 00:52:42.059
each other.
 

00:52:42.059 --> 00:52:45.469
Okay, have to stop there--might
add a word or two--but on

00:52:45.469 --> 00:52:48.025
Thursday we turn,
I'm afraid with a certain

00:52:48.025 --> 00:52:50.338
awkwardness;
I wish there were an

00:52:50.338 --> 00:52:53.550
intervening weekend,
to Freud and Peter Brooks.

00:52:53.550 --> 00:52:57.130
In the meantime,
we'll see you then.

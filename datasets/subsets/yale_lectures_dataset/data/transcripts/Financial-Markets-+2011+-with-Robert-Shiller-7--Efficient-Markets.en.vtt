00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.850
And I want to talk today about
efficient markets, which is a

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:10.080
theory that is a half-truth,
I will say.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.500
Before I start, I wanted to just
give a few thoughts about

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.920
David Swensen's lecture
last period.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.460
Let me say, first of all, the
Efficient Markets Hypothesis

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
or the Efficient Markets
Theory is a theory that

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.110
markets efficiently incorporate
all public

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.340
information.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.990
And that, therefore, you
cannot beat the market,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.940
because the market has all
the information in it.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.730
You think you're smarter
than the market,

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.270
that you know something?

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.980
No, the market knows
more than you do.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.680
And you'll find out that the
market wins every time.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.930
That's the Efficient
Markets Hypothesis.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.560
So, it's a very far-reaching
hypothesis.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.680
It means that, don't even
try to beat the market.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.970
That was a very rudimentary

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.320
introduction to today's lecture.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.040
But here I brought in David
Swensen, who is claimed to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.870
have beaten the market
consistently since 1985, and

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.730
dramatically.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.165
And so, what do we
make of that?

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.710
That's the subject of
today's lecture.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.090
By the way, after class one of
you came up -- thank you, it

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.800
was nice, I don't know
where you are --

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.220
one of you came up and thanked
Swensen for his

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.870
scholarship at Yale.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.510
Yale now has need-blind
admissions for the world.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.330
And so people, not just from the
United States, people are

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.819
helped out, so that people who
have managed to meet the high

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.340
admission standards here, it
makes it possible for them to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.800
actually come here.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.070
And that's substantially David
Swensen who did that, because

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.550
it's not just the generosity
of the university.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.250
They have to have the
money to do it.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.070
And so, somehow he seems
to have made it.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.620
And I know that there are
still many cynics -- the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.130
Efficient Markets Hypothesis has
a lot of adherents still.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.230
And as I say, it's
a half-truth.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.180
So, some people will say, well,
Swensen was just lucky.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.950
And I say, how could he
have been lucky for

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.410
25 years in a row?

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.920
Well, not every single year,
but pretty much.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.120
And they say, well, you're
picking the one guy out of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.440
millions who is just the
luckiest. So, those

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.740
arguments are made.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.350
Anyway, one of you asked a
question, which I thought it

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.090
was very good, at the end.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.090
And that is why, in all of my
discussion about Swensen and

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.110
all of his talk we never
mentioned the Sharpe ratio?

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.610
Because as we said,
the Sharpe ratio

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:12.090
corrects for risk taking.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.870
That was one of our fundamental
lessons.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.360
And we showed you the Efficient
Portfolio Frontier,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.200
and the tangency line.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.560
You can get any expected return
you want at the expense

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.630
of higher uncertainty.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.320
You do a very risky portfolio,
and you have high expected

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.450
return, because of the risk.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.350
If the risk is measured right.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.130
But I think that's a good
very good question.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.980
I caught myself not correcting
for it, I just said Yale's

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.600
portfolio had a high return.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.540
I didn't correct for standard
deviation of return.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.720
So, David Swensen, in his
answer, as you recall,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.079
essentially said he doesn't
believe in Sharpe ratios,

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.850
because we can't measure
the standard deviation.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.760
The Sharpe ratio is the excess
return of a portfolio over the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.500
market, divided by the standard

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.160
deviation of the return.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.840
And that scales it down, so if
the excess return is very high

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.080
but also has a very high
standard deviation, that shows

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.990
they were just taking risks.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.770
And so the Sharpe ratio
would reveal that.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.370
But Swensen said, I don't think
that you can measure the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.200
standard deviation of return.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.040
Isn't that what is answer was?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.120
You were here.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.590
I may not be quoting
him exactly right.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.050
So, why wouldn't you be able
to measure the standard

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.590
deviation of returns?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.940
He gave a reason, which was
that, well, when you're

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.010
looking at a broad portfolio
like Yale's, a lot of the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.570
things in there are
private equity --

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.220
that means privately
held, so it's not

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.180
traded on stock exchanges.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.880
Or it's real estate.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.950
Real estate is only traded every
10 years or 20 years,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.220
and so who knows what
it's worth?

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.090
All you have is an appraisal,
but that's just some

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.700
appraiser's estimate, so the
standard deviation would be

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.280
artificially low.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.920
He's right about that,
but I think there's

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.760
even more to that.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.340
I know there's more to this.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.590
There's a literature on this.

00:05:29.775 --> 00:05:37.360
The point that I wanted to make
is that you can do a --

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.970
suppose you're managing money.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.860
And suppose the world out there
is evaluating you by

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.310
your Sharpe ratio.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:48.700
And suppose you have
no ethics.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.770
You just want money.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.770
This isn't so obviously
criminal, this is

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.710
not criminal I suppose.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.300
So, you say, I just want to have
the best Sharpe ratio for

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.340
a number of years running.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.710
I'll get more and more people
that will put money in my

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.550
investment fund, and
eventually I

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.620
don't care what happens.

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.910
I'll move to Brazil
or something.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:13.100
Some foreign country
-- pick out one.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.810
I want to get out of here
with the money.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.860
So, all I have to do is fool
people into thinking I have a

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.030
high Sharpe ratio for a while.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.540
So, what do I do?

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:30.670
Well, there's an interesting
paper on this by --

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.030
there's a lot of papers
on this, but I'm

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.945
going to cite one --

00:06:33.945 --> 00:06:40.720
by Professor Goetzmann and
co-authors, here at Yale.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:53.220
It's actually Goetzmann,
Ibbotson, Spiegel, and Welch.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.420
Maybe I'll put all
their names on.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.290
Roger Ibbotson is a professor
here, Matt

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.830
Spiegel, and Ivo Welch.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:06.120
What they did is they calculated
the optimal

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.360
strategy for someone who
wants to play games

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.140
with a Sharpe ratio.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.600
So, you want to fool investors
and get a spuriously high

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.270
Sharpe ratio.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.510
And they found out what the
optimal strategy is.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.840
And that is to sell off
the tails of your

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:26.680
distribution of returns.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.270
So, if your return distribution
looks like this

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.520
-- this is returns.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.620
And you have a probability
distribution, say a

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.870
bell-shaped curve.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.760
And so the mean and standard
deviation of this would be the

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.130
inputs to the Sharpe ratio.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:50.730
But if you're cynical and you
want to play tricks, what you

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.215
can do is sell the upper tail.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.940
These are very unlikely
good events.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.400
Sell them and get money now,
and then double up on the

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.860
lower tail.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:09.010
So, you push the lower tail to
something like that, and you

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:13.030
wipe out the upper tail,
so it goes like that.

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:16.679
So, that means you'll get money,
because you sold the

00:08:16.679 --> 00:08:17.640
upper tail.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.940
You would do that by selling
calls -- we haven't talked

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.770
about options yet -- but you
can do it by selling

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:27.470
out-of-the-money calls.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.920
And you would do this by writing
out-of-the-money puts.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.230
OK, but what you do it you make
it, so that if there's

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:38.120
really a bad year, it's going
to be a doozer bad year for

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.800
your investors.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.210
And if there's ever a good
year, then, hey,

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.390
you won't get it.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.300
But these good or bad years
occur only infrequently.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.030
So, in the meantime, you're
making profits from these

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.720
sales and you have a
high Sharpe ratio.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.030
But little do they know --

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.150
you sold off the tails.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:00.010
And so nothing happens for many
years and you just look

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.860
like the best guy there.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:10.790
So, it turns out that this
is not just academic.

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:18.640
There was a company called
Integral Investment Management

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.305
that did something like
this strategy.

00:09:20.305 --> 00:09:21.720
It was a hedge fund.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:31.350
So, it was Integral Investment
Management.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.700
It did something like this,
by trading in options.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.460
And it got lots of investors
to put millions in them.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.630
Notably, the Art Institute of
Chicago put $43 million into

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:54.470
this fund and its associated
funds.

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:59.040
And then, in 2001, when the
market dropped a lot, the Art

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.630
Institute of Chicago
was wiped out.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.420
They lost almost all of
their $43 million.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.310
And so, they got really angry,
and they sued this company.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:14.200
Because they said, you
didn't tell us.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.150
What have you been doing?

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.300
And then the company pointed
out, in its defense, that it

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.420
actually said somewhere in the
fine print that if markets go

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:26.770
down more than 30%, there
would be a problem.

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.170
And somehow nobody at the
Art Institute read that

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.860
or figured it out.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.070
They thought the guy was a
genius, because this company

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.370
had the highest Sharpe ratio
in the industry.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.450
You see what they're doing?

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.670
They're playing tricks.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.380
They're making it look like
there's less risk than

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:45.540
there really is.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.720
And there's a strategy
to do that.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.220
But it didn't end well for
Integral Investment

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.130
Management, because the Art
Institute of Chicago managed

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.770
to stick them on other things
-- they disclosed it.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.120
They told people that they
were doing this strategy.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:07.040
The artists didn't
figure it out.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.180
But there were other
dishonesties that they nailed

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.430
these guys on.

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:22.010
What Goetzmann and his
co-authors did is they showed

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.140
that you can play tricks with
the -- you can play a lot of

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:26.500
tricks in finance.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.370
But one of them is to play a
trick with the Sharpe ratio.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.925
But their trick was
very explicit.

00:11:30.925 --> 00:11:34.130
It involved particular
portfolio composition

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:37.690
involving options, and any
professional would immediately

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.130
know that that's a trick.

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.830
And it didn't work for these
guys, they were too aggressive

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.360
in their manipulation.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.180
But you can do subtler things as
a portfolio manager to get

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.920
your Sharpe ratio up.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:57.960
Instead of manipulating with
special derivatives positions

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:07.080
you could just buy companies
that have large left tails.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.150
They have a small probability
of massive losses.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.210
And you haven't done anything
but pick a stock.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:17.370
And nobody knows whether it
really has a small probability

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.270
of massive losses,
and you could

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.150
systematically invest in that.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:27.250
And then you'd have a high
Sharpe ratio for a while, and

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.510
then you'd just blow up and lose
everything eventually.

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:34.220
I was thinking of an example
from recent news.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:38.750
What about the strategy of
investing in Egyptian

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.620
companies that are
tied to Mubarak?

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.280
It might have looked very good
for a long time, right?

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.320
But the companies might have
been underpriced, because

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.250
people sensed there's some
instability in Egypt.

00:12:55.250 --> 00:12:58.100
And look how fast it came on.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.790
I don't know what the outcome
will be at this point, but it

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.680
just happened -- bang.

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.360
That's a tail event, right?

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.010
You might look at Egyptian
securities and think

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.560
everything is stable and fine,
it's been 30 years, nothing

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.440
has happened.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.560
But someone knows or suspects
that there's

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.980
something maybe unstable.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.120
And you, as an investor,
wouldn't know that by looking

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.370
at the numbers.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:28.120
What I'm getting at is really
what is the essence of

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:32.440
Swensen's skill or
contribution?

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.700
It's not his ability to
manipulate Sharpe ratios or

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.030
numbers like that.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:41.870
I think what it has, to me, in
my mind, is something to do

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:50.365
with character and his real self
and his real objectives.

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:57.150
And this gets at what people in
finance are really doing.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.670
I think that when you take
a finance course in a

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:06.930
university, you may not get a
proper appreciation of how

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.130
one, in a career in finance,
develops a

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:12.130
reputation for integrity.

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.940
Nobody can really judge what
you're doing as an investor,

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.450
because they can't judge
it from the statistics.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.150
Even though we've developed this
nice theory about Sharpe

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:25.900
ratios and the like, you end up
judging the person and what

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.590
the person's real
objectives are.

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:33.260
I'll probably come back
to that theme again.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.900
Let me also say that's about
doing the Goetzmann -- you

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:38.150
understand the strategy?

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.650
It's like investing
in securities with

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.710
time bombs in them.

00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:48.200
They're going to go off
eventually, you don't know

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.490
exactly when.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:53.830
And they look good for a while,
but they'll blow up.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.590
What does the law
say about this?

00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:00.240
Well, the law in the United
States and other countries

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:05.310
emphasizes that an investment
manager must not fail to

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:09.840
disclose relevant information
about a security.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.270
And it has to be more than
boilerplate disclosure.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.540
For, say Integral Investment
Management, you could write up

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.020
a prospectus and say, but of
course past returns are not a

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.160
guide to the future and
something could go wrong.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.300
That's a boilerplate disclosure,
because people

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.460
think, well, that's what
everybody says.

00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.120
The law says that you have to
actually actively disclose.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.970
If there's something that's
relevant that would make your

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:42.460
statistics misleading, you have
to get their attention

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.180
and explain it to them.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.670
That's the law.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:48.620
So, I think it's laws like
that, and it's the

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.140
development of --

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.130
it's not something that we
specialize in academia.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.765
Well, we are, we're trying to
develop character I suppose.

00:15:56.765 --> 00:15:59.310
But it's not just
Sharpe ratios.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:03.090
And I think that tendencies to
rely on numbers like this has

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.780
led to errors in the past.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:12.440
So, let me go more directly
into today's lecture.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:24.910
It's about the Efficient Markets
Hypothesis, which is,

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:30.260
to me, a fascinating theory,
which is not completely true,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.090
which makes it all the
more interesting.

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.850
The first statement that
I could find --

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:38.980
I'm interested in the history
of thought --

00:16:38.980 --> 00:16:44.536
so, the first statement of the
efficient markets hypothesis

00:16:44.536 --> 00:16:52.460
that I could find was in
a book by George --

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:07.109
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.400
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: George
Gibson, who wrote a

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:18.560
book in 1889 called The Stock
Exchanges of London, Paris,

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.810
and New York.

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:27.310
I'm quoting George Gibson,
1889: "When shares become

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.040
publicly known in an open
market, the value, which they

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.330
acquire there, may be regarded
as the judgment of the best

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.830
intelligence concerning them."

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.720
He described the stock market
as a kind of voting machine

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.660
where people vote.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:47.130
If you think a share is worth
more, you vote by buying it.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.580
If you think it's worth less
in the market, you sell it.

00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.560
And everybody in the
world can do that.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.625
It's open to the public.

00:17:54.625 --> 00:17:58.670
So, the smartest people get into
it, and then they soon

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.930
make a lot of money doing it,
so they have a lot of votes.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.750
So, the smarter people
have more votes.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.850
And you've got everyone there.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:10.850
If anyone has a special clue,
they go right in and they buy

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.180
if it's positive, or they
sell if it's negative.

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:15.940
So, the smartest people
go right in there and

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.000
aggressively affect the value.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.770
Until it's right, and then
there's no there's no

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:22.190
incentive to buy or sell.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:23.620
The other thing about
Gibson --

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.100
I should have copied the quote,
but as I remember from

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:30.870
the book, he says something like
''in our modern electric

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:38.180
age, information flows with the
speed of light.'' I say,

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.160
what is he talking
about in 1889?

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:41.340
Well, you know what he's
talking about.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.560
The telegraph.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.900
In fact, they had
ticker machines.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.500
They were electronic
printers that would

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.020
print out stock quotes.

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.350
So, they were really in the
information age by 1889.

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.590
So, this is what happened,
Gibson said, you can't beat

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.430
the market.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:05.470
It's just smarter because --
it's like Wikipedia is smarter

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.510
than any one of us, right?

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:07.820
Because it puts together
all the

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.270
thinking of all the people.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.260
Well, they had Wikipedia of a
sort, because they had the

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.920
stock market.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.460
They had the price.

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:21.800
So, that is the statement
that --

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.590
he didn't use the word
''Efficient Markets.''

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:27.160
Actually, tried to find the
origin of "Efficient Markets."

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.120
Sometimes in the 19th century,
people would say ''Efficient

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:38.840
Markets.'' But it wasn't a
cliche yet, it wasn't a phrase

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:41.390
that would be recognizable.

00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:42.960
Even in this context,
they would use it.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:44.810
But it was not a name
for a theory yet.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:54.040
The next Efficient Markets
theorist -- and I put this on

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:54.990
your reading list --

00:19:54.990 --> 00:20:02.220
Charles Conant, who wrote a 1904
book called Wall Street

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:04.330
and the Country.

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:08.590
I put one chapter on that on the
reading list, because it

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:12.970
was a statement of the Efficient
Markets Hypothesis,

00:20:12.970 --> 00:20:17.410
which was remarkably
well-written, I thought.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:21.330
He starts out the chapter by
pointing out that a lot of

00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:24.400
people think speculation
is a kind of gambling,

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.080
or a kind of evil.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.850
Speculating on the stock market,
that sounds like some

00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:32.870
wild activity that ought
to be ruled out.

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:37.260
Then he said, how can that
possibly be true?

00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.970
The stock market is a
central institution

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.160
of all modern economies.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.580
To think that it's just
gambling just

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.270
defies common sense.

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:52.440
Then he goes on and describes
what it is that it does.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.350
And there's some really nice
passages in Conant's book.

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:00.360
In one passage he says, suppose
for a moment that

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.760
stock markets of the world were

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.260
closed, what would happen?

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:07.250
He said no one would know
what anything is worth.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:10.090
No one could make any calculated
decisions.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:13.200
He said that, in fact, capital
moves around from one industry

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.205
to another in respect to the
prices that are quoted in

00:21:17.205 --> 00:21:17.880
these markets.

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:20.365
And if you didn't see the
prices, you would be blind.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:26.730
It's often said about the
Soviet economy --

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:29.960
which did not have
stock markets or

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.190
financial markets --

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:35.850
that they relied on prices
in the rest of the world.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.290
Nobody in the Soviet Union could
plan very well, because

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:40.110
they didn't know what
anything was worth.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.460
But at least they had the rest
of the world, and they

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:44.460
thought, well that's an
approximation to what prices

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.015
ought to be in the
Soviet Union.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.180
I just wanted to reiterate a
little bit about the intuition

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.940
of Efficient Markets.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:08.620
The idea is that if you trade
securities, the advantage to

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.870
being there a little bit ahead
of anyone else is enormous.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:15.450
If you know five minutes before
the other investors

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.110
about some good news or bad
news, either way it doesn't

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.940
matter -- you know it five
minutes earlier, you jump

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:22.610
right in and trade.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.660
You can trade ahead of them
and prices haven't changed

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:26.970
yet, you make money.

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:30.870
So, that has created an
industry that speeds

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:33.160
information.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:37.780
The first such industry
that I would tell

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:42.020
you about is Reuters.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.670
Mr. Reuters, I think in the
1840s before the telegraph,

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:51.810
created a financial information
service using

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:53.910
carrier pigeons.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.200
You know, these are birds.

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:59.640
So, when he was in London with
some information, they had

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.490
carrier pigeons that were
brought from Paris, and as

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:05.490
soon as new information came
out, they would tie it to the

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:07.570
foot of the little bird and
they'd let it go, and it would

00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:09.170
fly to Paris.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.420
It would go to its roosting
place, the message would be

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.070
read, and subscribers
would be notified.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.700
And that was no joke, that
really worked, because you

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.340
would have information hours or
even days before everyone

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:22.130
else in Paris.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.960
So, you could make a killing.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.300
So, Reuters today, it's now
called Thomson Reuters, is

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:29.980
still in that business.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.990
The carrier pigeons were
a brilliant idea.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.840
But they had to keep up with
the times, because, shortly

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:40.360
thereafter, the telegraph was
invented and pigeons no longer

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.580
were the leading technology.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.830
But maybe that was the beginning
of the information

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.030
age, with pigeons.

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.410
Now we have beepers, and
we have the internet.

00:23:50.410 --> 00:23:53.490
A beeper is something you can
carry in your pocket that

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.250
beeps when there's
financial news.

00:23:55.250 --> 00:24:01.640
So, suppose a company makes an
announcement that that it has,

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:06.930
say, a new drug that's
successful in trials.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:11.210
As soon as they make the
announcement, it then goes out

00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.210
electronically everywhere, and
the beepers start beeping.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.460
And all the investment analysts,
they drop their

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:20.890
morning coffee, because they
know they have to act fast.

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.880
So, you get this new
announcement.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.010
Now it's t plus 20 seconds.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:28.200
He's got his drug specialist
on the phone.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:28.980
What does this mean?

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:31.540
Quick, how much is it
going to go up?

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.020
And so the guy says, I don't
know, first thought, maybe

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:36.060
it's going to go
up $2 a share.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.475
OK, it's only gone up $1 a
share, I'll buy right now.

00:24:39.475 --> 00:24:45.400
And now it's two minutes after
the announcement, and then the

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:47.690
analyst says, I've thought about
it a little bit more.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:51.260
No, I only think it's
$1.50 a share.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:54.210
This is homing in, and so the
price is jiggling around

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:57.310
rapidly as all this is happening
for a few minutes,

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:58.430
and then it settles down.

00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:59.742
Because after --

00:24:59.742 --> 00:25:03.710
I may be exaggerating -- after
10 minutes, they've kind of

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.610
figured it out and it's
reached its new level.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:11.890
They'll be thinking about it the
next morning when they're

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:14.770
taking their shower, and they'll
get a better and

00:25:14.770 --> 00:25:18.690
better, more refined idea
of what the price is.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:20.300
But here's the Efficient
Markets theme.

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:22.870
You, the next day, read about it
in the Wall Street Journal

00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:23.710
in the morning.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:26.840
You're now 24 hours late.

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.950
So, you call your broker and
say, maybe I should buy this

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.550
stock, they've got this
new breakthrough.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:34.830
Your broker might laugh
at you, right?

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:37.580
Because you're 24 hours late.

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:42.850
And what do you know, anyway,
about pharmaceuticals?

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:45.970
That's where the Efficient
Markets Hypothesis is true.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.870
You can't expect to routinely
profit from information that's

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:52.470
already out there.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.550
If you're going to profit,
you've got to come up with

00:25:54.550 --> 00:26:00.660
something faster, something
that you can get faster.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.090
I think this is somewhat what
David Swensen was referring to

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:04.550
yesterday
[correction: last lecture],

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:08.840
when he talked about different
asset classes.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.310
Remember how he talked about
comparing the top quartile and

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:17.520
bottom quartile of investment
managers, in terms of returns,

00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.730
or at different asset classes?

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:22.530
Well, the managers weren't
able to beat the

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.360
bond market very much.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.450
The top quartile wasn't
able to beat the

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.990
stock market very much.

00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:32.930
But when you get to unusual
assets, private equity, which

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:36.850
is not traded on stock
exchanges, or absolute return

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:38.710
investments that he talked
about -- they're unusual,

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.990
smaller, rare investments that
the public doesn't have a lot

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:43.020
of information about.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:46.590
And these guys can get ahead
on those things.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:51.750
So, part of what makes Swensen a
success is picking his game.

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.420
Even so the stock market is not
completely efficient, but

00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:58.180
it's so much more efficient,
because it's so many people

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.430
involved in it and
watching it.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.110
So, maybe I should write here,
because this is what we're

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:06.360
talking about here.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.100
The Efficient Markets
Hypothesis.

00:27:12.474 --> 00:27:15.570
I'll write it down.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:23.730
This is the name for this
idea that was coined --

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:29.730
or sometimes people say
Efficient Markets theory.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.600
They're referring to what Conant
and Gibson and other

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:35.310
people had been talking about
for a long time, and it was

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:37.470
common knowledge.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:48.790
But the first person to use this
term apparently was Harry

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:55.240
Roberts, a professor at the
University of Chicago.

00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:01.610
But he was made famous by Eugene
Fama, who referred to

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.050
it as Harry Roberts's idea.

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:09.290
Eugene Fama is maybe the
best-known finance professor

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:10.140
in the country, I think.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.905
He is also at the University
of Chicago.

00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:18.210
He's been talked about as a
Nobel Prize candidate for a

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:22.280
long time, and he should have
won probably, even though his

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.270
theory is not entirely right.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:27.580
I think his chances of getting
it have dimmed a little bit,

00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:31.670
because the theory is not looked
upon as quite such an

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.260
absolute truth as
it used to be.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.550
As I said, it's a half-truth.

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:44.400
What Conant said is all
well-taken and right, but

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.950
there's other nuances and
it's not exactly --

00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:49.930
when you first read Conant, you

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:50.980
think, the guy is brilliant.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.470
That's what I thought,
this is right on.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.180
Then you read it again, you
think, well, you know maybe

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:58.750
there is a little gambling
in the financial market.

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:00.880
Things don't always
work right.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:04.380
So, he was maybe a little
bit too positive.

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:13.410
I can give a little
history of this.

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:18.020
It was in 1960.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.190
The University of Chicago
is kind of the

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:22.170
forerunner in this.

00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:27.170
In 1960, Ford Foundation gave
a grant to the University of

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:33.210
Chicago to assemble all stock
price data back to 1926.

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.550
And to get it right.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:41.230
So, they set up the Center for
Research in Securities Prices

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:42.480
at Chicago.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.540
The Center for Research in
Securities Prices, or CRSP, as

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:55.970
it's called, had a Ford
Foundation grant to go to the

00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:00.330
stock exchanges in the United
States and get all the data,

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.790
and get it right.

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.770
Remember, I told you they
have splits in stocks.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:08.080
So, you see the price of a
share, and then suddenly the

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.770
price will fall in half or maybe
it will double, because

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:14.250
they changed the units
of measurement.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.300
If you wanted to know, what is
the price history of stocks

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:20.110
over the long haul, no one had
ever organized that and

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.170
figured out things like that,
and got it right.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.430
And when were the
dividends paid?

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:27.050
When did you actually
get the dividends?

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.710
So they said, let's
get it right.

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.200
Let's put it on -- hey, this
is really super modern -- a

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.290
UNIVAC tape.

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:37.870
That's a computer tape.

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.130
We'll put it on a tape and
we'll sell it at cost to

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.900
anybody in the world.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:44.650
And so the Ford Foundation,
which is a non-profit, said:

00:30:44.650 --> 00:30:47.350
Good idea, let's do it.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.230
So, that CRSP tape has launched
a revolution in

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:52.160
finance, because nobody
had the data.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.020
They were throwing it away,
it was not used.

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.050
How do you know what Sharpe
ratios are if you

00:30:58.050 --> 00:31:00.320
don't have the data?

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.330
I mean, you could find it in
newspapers, but it wasn't

00:31:02.330 --> 00:31:05.280
organized right, it wasn't
set up right.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:10.185
So, with the invention of the
CRSP tape in 1960, it really

00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:14.070
gave impetus to the Efficient
Markets revolution.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.410
And by the end of that decade,
there were thousands of

00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.390
articles testing market
efficiency

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:21.910
using the CRSP tape.

00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:27.830
And, in particular in 1969,
Eugene Fama wrote one of the

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:30.200
most cited articles in the
history of finance.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.240
It was called "Efficient Capital
Markets: A Review".

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.930
So, he reviews all of these
studies of the CRSP tape.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.110
And it looked authoritative for
the first time, because we

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.750
were using the whole universe
of stocks, all

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:46.730
the way back to 1926.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.380
That sounded like a long time,
and a lot of data.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:56.580
And Fama said it's not uniform,
there are some

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.900
negative results, but the
evidence is that markets are

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.710
remarkably efficient.

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.080
And this is a truth that
we've discovered.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.020
And that was really a bombshell,
because he was

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.110
discrediting, or seeming to
discredit, practically all the

00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:14.770
investment managers
in the country.

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:16.260
It was a huge industry.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:19.220
And he's claiming the successful
ones must have just

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.060
been lucky, because the market
is so efficient that we can't

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:26.560
see any way that you could
make money in the market.

00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:36.760
The high point of the Efficient
Markets Hypothesis

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:40.470
was probably in the 1970s.

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.610
I'll call that the high point.

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:46.500
It seemed, at that time, that
all of the scholars were

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.120
finding that there was no
way to beat the market.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:55.230
But it started to deteriorate,
the support for the Efficient

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:56.480
Markets Hypothesis.

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.380
There's been a change
in thinking.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.550
Efficient Markets is still
regarded with respect, but not

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:17.820
the same respect that it
had in 1969 or in 1979.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:22.220
I have here some indication of
how thinking has changed about

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.240
Efficient Markets.

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:28.050
The textbook that I used to
use for this course --

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:30.650
I've been teaching this
course for 25 years --

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:31.930
Fabozzi et al.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:34.390
wasn't even written when I
started, so I was using a

00:33:34.390 --> 00:33:41.290
textbook called Brealey
&amp; Myers, Principles

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:44.220
of Corporate Finance.

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.730
I still have all these
old editions.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:47.980
It's a very successful
textbook.

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:55.159
Since I was teaching out of it
all those years, I went back

00:33:55.159 --> 00:33:55.750
and looked --

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.860
I don't have the first edition
of that book, I have the

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.949
second edition, 1984 -- and I
was teaching out of it in this

00:34:01.949 --> 00:34:05.889
same class in 1984.

00:34:05.889 --> 00:34:09.969
At the end of that book, there's
a chapter on the seven

00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:12.929
most important ideas
in finance.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.730
And one of the ideas is
Efficient Markets.

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:19.370
And quoting the textbook,
Brealey and Myers say:

00:34:19.370 --> 00:34:23.870
"Security prices accurately
reflect available information

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:27.300
and respond rapidly to new
information as soon as it

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:32.370
becomes available." They they
do qualify it, in 1984.

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:35.270
"Don't misunderstand the
Efficient Markets idea.

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:38.469
It doesn't say there are
no taxes or costs.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:41.270
It doesn't say there aren't some
clever people and some

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:45.810
stupid ones, it merely implies
that competition in actual

00:34:45.810 --> 00:34:48.070
capital markets is very tough.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:52.390
There are no money machines and
security prices reflect

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:57.260
the true underlying value of
assets." Let me repeat that:

00:34:57.260 --> 00:35:00.930
"Security prices reflect the
true underlying value of

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:08.150
assets." That's a pretty strong
statement, right?

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.730
But that's Efficient Markets.

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:13.910
They just said it in their
second edition of the book.

00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:15.530
Not many people would
say that, right?

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:18.720
Trust the stock market, don't
trust people you know and love

00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.410
and trust. Trust the
stock market.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:24.500
Well, they deleted that from
later editions of their book.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:29.460
I think that's a sign
of changes.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:32.200
So, I was looking at
the 2008 edition.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:34.220
They've now taken on
a third author.

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:36.180
They're getting tired of coming
out with more and more

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.660
editions of their book, so
they've taken on Franklin

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.050
Allen from the Wharton School.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:45.030
They've deleted what I just
read, and now it says --

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:49.080
I'm quoting from them: "Much
more research is needed before

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:53.710
we have a full understanding of
why asset prices sometimes

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:57.630
get so out of line with what
appears to be their discounted

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.130
future payoffs." That's
a complete

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.920
turnaround in the textbook.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.330
This is one of the most popular
textbooks, and they've

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:07.270
changed completely.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:13.410
So, I think we have an idea that
started around the 1960s.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:16.870
It was somehow associated with
computers, and electronic

00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:19.480
databases, and modern
thinking, and

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:21.560
mathematical finance.

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.120
They kind of went
too far with it.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:28.000
They concluded that you just
can't beat the market.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.910
Another thing I put on the
reading list is a reading from

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:32.670
The New Yorker magazine.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.235
It just came out in December.

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.620
I thought it was relevant.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.660
It's by Jonah Lehrer and the
title of the article is "The

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:48.450
Truth Wears Off: Is There
Something Wrong With the

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:53.160
Scientific Method?" I don't
think there's anything wrong

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.750
with the scientific method, but
I was interested in this

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.710
article, because what The New
Yorker article points out is

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:03.400
that a lot of scientists --
and this is outside of

00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:07.880
finance, I'm making a parallel
here -- a lot of scientists

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.440
who follow careful scientific
procedures seem to generate

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.940
results that are later
discredited.

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.870
And nobody can figure out why.

00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:21.280
It's like the universe
is changing.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.060
He gives an example in The
New Yorker article --

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:26.880
and this is from drugs --

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.770
there's a class of drugs called
second-generation

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:32.500
antipsychotics.

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:38.110
These are used for people who
are either schizophrenic or --

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.760
I guess it can be used more
generally than that -- some of

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.500
the drugs are called Abilify,
Seroquel, Zyprexa.

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:49.540
When these drugs were first
introduced, careful studies

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.800
that passed muster in the best
medical journals found that

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:54.580
they were highly effective.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:59.130
And they were written up as a
godsend, a way of dealing with

00:37:59.130 --> 00:38:02.380
problems that used to
weigh on people.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:03.630
Wonderful.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:09.190
The medical procedures involved
careful controls on

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:14.130
studies including a double
blind procedure.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:19.600
When you want to test a drug
on human subjects, both the

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:22.660
subject doesn't know whether he
or she is getting the drug,

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:26.060
and the experimenter, who runs
experiment, doesn't know which

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.680
one is the drug.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.430
So, you give bottle A and bottle
B to the experimenter,

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:36.050
and the experimenter is never
told, which one is Zyprexa and

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:37.790
which one is a placebo.

00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:40.640
And then the experimenter has to
write up a whole report on

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:44.520
drug A and drug B,
not even knowing.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.260
This is to eliminate
any possible bias.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:48.730
So, these drugs passed that.

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:49.340
You see what I'm saying?

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.680
The controls were right,
everything was good.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:57.590
And as years go by, the tests
start coming out -- the new

00:38:57.590 --> 00:39:00.630
attempts to replicate
those start

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.160
coming out more negative.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.290
They didn't disprove the drugs,
they just weren't such

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:08.560
wonder drugs as they thought.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.380
So, how can that be?

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.480
And what the article says, well,
it must be that somehow

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.410
scientific bias, when there's
an enthusiasm for some new

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:19.760
theory, it creeps in even
if you try to make

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.480
the strongest controls.

00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:24.930
You say, how could that happen
with a double blind procedure?

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.120
Well, maybe they broke the
double blind somehow.

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.090
They tried, but the guy,
experimenter, figured it out.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.420
And then he started not
deliberately fabricating

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.730
results, but it's the kind of
thing where one subject says,

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.740
I didn't take my Abilify
regularly.

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.970
I took two tablets last week.

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:46.390
I have to decide whether to
throw this person out of the

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:50.360
sample, and then I kind of
remember that the drug wasn't

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.300
working for this person, and
it colors my judgment, so I

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.290
throw them out.

00:39:56.290 --> 00:39:58.900
And another thing that happens
is that the studies that

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.310
didn't find it might have
been suppressed.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:03.940
Someone might have done
an Abilify test

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:05.790
and gotten bad results.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.860
And then showed it to their
superior and said, should I

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.530
publish this?

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.950
And the superior said, wait
a minute, there must be

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:12.000
something wrong here.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.550
Abilify is wonderful,
so let's look.

00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:16.620
And then they find something
that might be wrong, and he

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.800
says, you shouldn't
publish this,

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:21.170
because they find something.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:26.340
So, the publication process
is biased for a while, but

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:28.790
eventually it catches up.

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:30.690
So, I think the same thing
happened with the Efficient

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:31.640
Markets Hypothesis.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:34.810
In the initial enthusiasm,
anybody who found that the

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.410
Efficient Markets Hypothesis
wasn't supported by the

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.350
evidence, that person would
be told, look again.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:43.710
Maybe you've done
something wrong.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:48.390
So that's what happened.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:58.000
I wanted to do a little bit more
history and describe the

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.880
concept of Random Walk, which
is central to the Efficient

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.130
Markets Hypothesis.

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:15.620
Let me start, though, with a
little bit more history.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.870
Technical Analysis.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:27.150
This term goes back --

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:29.270
must be over 100 years.

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:33.810
Technical analysis is the
analysis of stock prices, or

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:38.480
maybe other speculative asset
prices, by looking at charts

00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:44.890
of the prices and looking for
patterns that suggest

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.440
movements in prices.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:51.500
The classic text of technical
analysis is Edwards and McGee.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:56.980
McGee, there's a famous
story about him.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:02.400
He was not a professor, he was a
Wall Street analyst. And the

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:05.470
story about him is that he
believed that you look at the

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.900
prices and you can
predict prices.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.610
And in fact, he said, I don't
want to look at anything else.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.270
I just want to see prices.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:14.840
I'll do plots, and I can --

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.750
using my judgment, I
can figure out what

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:19.590
it's going to do.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.510
And so, the story about McGee
is, everyone on Wall Street

00:42:22.510 --> 00:42:26.220
wants the corner office
overlooking the World Trade

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:28.670
Center, whatever.

00:42:28.670 --> 00:42:31.830
He said, I wanted an interior
office with no windows.

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.360
I don't want any distractions,
I don't want the real world

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:36.110
impinging in my judgment.

00:42:36.110 --> 00:42:39.250
And so, that's McGee.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:40.680
But he said that there
are certain things

00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:42.280
that you see obviously.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.490
For example, resistance level.

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:54.700
When the Dow Jones Industrial
Average approached 1,000 --

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.620
I think it was in the 1960s --

00:42:57.620 --> 00:42:59.850
it's way above that
now, as you know.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:04.100
But when it first approached
1,000, technical analysts

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.350
said, you know maybe it's going
to have trouble crossing

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.960
1,000, because that's a
psychological barrier.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:13.160
That's sounds magical, how can
the Dow be worth over 1,000?

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.210
Wow, I'm going to sell.

00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:17.560
And so, the idea was that people
would sell when it

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.590
approached 1,000.

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:21.350
And the technical analysts
seemed to be right, because

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:25.270
the Dow bounced around just
below 1,000 for a long time.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:28.520
I guess it was months or a year,
like it couldn't cross

00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.770
the resistance level.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.240
That's one example.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.770
I have another example,
which is from

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:36.140
Edwards and McGee's book.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:44:02.240
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.340
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: That's
Edwards and McGee, this

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.440
is one of the patterns.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:13.260
McGee was actually a student of
psychology, and he thought

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.750
certain kinds of patterns
seemed to have

00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.280
really spooked people.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.630
And this is one pattern, which
he called ''Head and

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:25.740
Shoulders.'' That's the head,
that's one shoulder, that's

00:44:25.740 --> 00:44:26.950
the other shoulder.

00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:30.480
He said, when you see this
pattern, watch out.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:34.000
It's going to, actually, totally
collapse, as it is

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.250
shown doing.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:41.830
These are stock prices
plotted against time.

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:45.800
These are days, each of
these points is a day.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.120
And this is from their book,
so it's hypothetical.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.670
You hardly ever see
such perfect Head

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:54.680
and Shoulders patterns.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:03.055
And so, maybe that's Edwards
and McGee's most famous.

00:45:03.055 --> 00:45:04.305
Head and Shoulders.

00:45:06.830 --> 00:45:08.520
So, the question is,
does it work?

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:09.770
Does it really work?

00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:18.020
In the early 1970s, when the
efficient markets hypothesis

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:22.765
was really strong, Burton
Malkiel, who was a professor

00:45:22.765 --> 00:45:25.956
at Princeton, and then later
he was the Dean of the Yale

00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:29.390
School of Management, wrote a
book called A Random Walk Down

00:45:29.390 --> 00:45:31.920
Wall Street, which claimed
that technical

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.910
analysis was bunk.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:37.170
And he said many studies have
shown that it doesn't work.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.260
This Head and Shoulders
doesn't work.

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:40.830
None of Edwards and McGee's
stuff worked.

00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:47.330
There were lots of studies, and
I actually met him at a

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:49.810
cocktail party after
his book came out.

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:52.600
And I said, you didn't footnote
all those studies

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.540
about technical analysis.

00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:56.250
Where are they?

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:57.180
I can't find them.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.360
I did a search.

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.840
Not on the internet, I did it
on something else, but I was

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.360
able to search.

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.670
I couldn't find them,
where are they?

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:10.630
And I found that he didn't
have an immediate answer.

00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:13.670
I suspect that he was
extrapolating -- there was a

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:17.440
literature on testing
market efficiency.

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.400
They looked for things
like momentum,

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.790
whether that continued.

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:24.390
But there was something a little
bit wrong with the

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:26.810
literature.

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:30.830
Not many people really
confronted technical analysis.

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:34.410
Later, there were people who
did look at some of Edwards

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:37.700
and McGee's points, and
they found some

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.600
element of truth to them.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:45.160
So, I think the answer is, McGee
wasn't a total idiot, as

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.760
you might infer from the
Efficient Markets Theory.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.090
But it's not going to make
you rich, either.

00:46:52.090 --> 00:46:56.540
If anything, technical analysis
is a subtle art that

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.870
can augment trading
strategies.

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.080
I bet David Swensen doesn't
do it at all.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.500
I could have asked, I
don't know for sure.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:09.010
Let me talk about Random
Walk, which is a

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:16.310
central idea in finance.

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:28.430
The idea is that, if stock
prices are really efficient,

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:31.000
then any change from
day to day has to

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.450
be due only to news.

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:37.300
And news is essentially
unforecastable.

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:40.760
Therefore, stock prices
have to do a random

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.010
walk through time.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:47.490
That means that any future
movement in them is always

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:48.740
unpredictable.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:54.830
The changes are totally
random.

00:47:54.830 --> 00:48:01.700
So, the term Random Walk
is an important term.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.500
It was coined not by a finance
theorist, but by a

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.700
statistician, Karl Pearson,
writing in the scientific

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:18.390
journal Nature in 1905.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:20.410
Now, he didn't link
it to finance.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:25.310
But what he said is, the
movements in some -- well, he

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:26.780
was thinking theoretically.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:30.740
Actually, I believe he used
the example of a drunk.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:35.090
Let's take someone who
is so drunk that

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:37.160
each step is random.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:42.230
This person has no direction at
all, staggering randomly.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.830
So, he starts out
at a lamp pole.

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.120
And what would you predict --
this is what Pearson asked --

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.445
what would you predict is his
position in 10 minutes?

00:48:51.445 --> 00:48:54.340
He happens to be at a
lamp pole right now.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:02.000
And what Pearson said is, well,
your best forecast is

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.750
that he's right where
he is now.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.030
Because you have no bias.

00:49:06.030 --> 00:49:08.070
He could go in any direction,
equally likely.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.510
So, what's most likely?

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:12.230
It's that he stays right
where he is.

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:15.130
And what is the probability
distribution?

00:49:15.130 --> 00:49:18.210
Well, it turns out that the
standard deviation around that

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:21.480
point goes up with the square
root of n steps.

00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:23.125
Because each step is independent
of the other, so

00:49:23.125 --> 00:49:25.580
the square root rule applies.

00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:28.850
So, if you're asked to forecast
his position after an

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:32.640
hour -- that's a lot of steps
-- you would say, I predict

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.110
he's right where he is now, but
I now have a big standard

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:37.470
deviation around it.

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:41.160
Pearson's article is
a very simple idea.

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:45.650
Among the readers, apparently,
was Albert Einstein and

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:48.360
Norbert Wiener, the
mathematician who had invented

00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:50.470
a continuous version
of the Random Walk,

00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:52.790
called the Wiener Process.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:55.580
But it got into finance later.

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:59.460
And in the Efficient Markets
revolution, they started to

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:10.630
realize that stock prices look
more like more like a Random

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:13.310
Walk than a Head
and Shoulders.

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.220
You look at these Head and
Shoulders patterns and they're

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:18.890
hard to find.

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:23.270
So, what is a Random Walk?

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.260
Let me just define it.

00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:29.700
A Random Walk is where you have
a series x sub t equals x

00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:34.720
sub t minus 1 plus epsilon
sub t, where

00:50:34.720 --> 00:50:37.250
epsilon sub t is noise.

00:50:37.250 --> 00:50:40.440
Just unforecastable
noise: mean 0 and

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:41.690
some standard deviation.

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:47.160
Ideally, it would be normally
distributed, so it would have

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.680
a bell-shaped curve, and then
the math would be very easy

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.930
and very simple.

00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:58.620
So, I want I want to contrast
that with an alternative,

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:01.670
which is called a
''First-Order

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:03.900
Autoregressive.'' Let me
get my notation here.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:12.110
Let's take a process that starts
at 100 -- that's like

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:17.590
the lamp post. We'll say x
sub t equals -- how am I

00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:18.840
putting this --

00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:29.916
100 plus some number rho --
that's a rho -- times x sub t

00:51:29.916 --> 00:51:36.660
minus 1 minus 100 plus
epsilon sub t.

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:40.630
So, this is an AR-1.

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:44.570
That's First-Order
Autoregressive.

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:51.947
It's like a regression model
where 100 times 1 minus rho is

00:51:51.947 --> 00:51:53.110
the constant term.

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:58.110
And the coefficient of
the lagged x is rho.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:07.770
And we usually require that rho
is between minus 1 and 1.

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:09.940
Normally, rho is positive.

00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:18.640
So, that means that it's
mean-reverting, but slowly.

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:26.160
First of all, in a special case
where rho equals 1, I

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:29.755
wouldn't call it an AR-1
anymore, because it reduces to

00:52:29.755 --> 00:52:30.750
a Random Walk, right?

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:35.080
If you make rho 1, then the
constant term drops out.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:38.270
I've got 100 minus 100 --

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:41.810
there's no constant term --
and then I've got x sub t

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:44.020
equals x sub t minus 1
plus epsilon sub t,

00:52:44.020 --> 00:52:46.230
that's a Random Walk.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:50.870
So, in the extreme case where
rho gets to one, then a

00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:56.560
First-Order Autoregressive
process

00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.350
converges to a Random Walk.

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:05.220
I wanted to show you some
simulations of it.

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:25.515
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:53:25.515 --> 00:53:30.970
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: OK,
this here is a plot I had.

00:53:30.970 --> 00:53:34.010
Let's first look at
the black line.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:39.540
The black line is the Standard &amp;
Poor's composite stock price

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:50.700
index in real terms. I have that
from 1871 until recently.

00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:53.790
That's just there for
comparison, that is the actual

00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:56.980
stock market.

00:53:56.980 --> 00:54:03.070
The pink line is a Random Walk
that I generated using this

00:54:03.070 --> 00:54:03.279
formula [correction: The pink
line is a Random Walk with a

00:54:03.279 --> 00:54:05.630
time trend, to be explained
below.], and a random number

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:12.310
generator that generates random
normal variables.

00:54:16.060 --> 00:54:23.000
I started them out at the same
level, but don't they look

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:24.250
kind of similar?

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.580
If you look at the stock market
without comparing it

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:35.675
with a Random Walk, it looks
like it has patterns in it.

00:54:35.675 --> 00:54:39.850
In fact, here's a Head and
Shoulders, right here.

00:54:39.850 --> 00:54:42.380
Bang, bang, bang.

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:42.790
When is that?

00:54:42.790 --> 00:54:47.730
I think this is 1937.

00:54:47.730 --> 00:54:48.024
This is --

00:54:48.024 --> 00:54:49.274
I am not sure --

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:54.910
1930, 1931?

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:57.470
And this is just
before the war.

00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:59.600
I'm not sure exactly.

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.560
It's a nice Head
and Shoulders.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.400
Hey, Edwards and McGee are
sort of right, right?

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:05.564
It dropped a lot after that.

00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:11.700
You know, I can find Head and
Shoulders up here, too, right?

00:55:11.700 --> 00:55:12.950
Maybe.

00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.240
The black line is actual
U.S. history,

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.950
that's the stock market.

00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:28.040
The pink line is a fake stock
line generated with pure

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:28.980
random noise.

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.450
And the fact that it's going
up is just chance.

00:55:31.450 --> 00:55:33.740
I can actually use
this program to

00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:34.990
generate other examples.

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:39.560
This should change, let
me see, make sure

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.060
it's working here.

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:42.760
The black line is the same.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.340
I'm not going to change
the black line, the

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.600
black line is history.

00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:49.880
I just did a brand new Random
Walk calculation using my

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:55.960
random number generator, which
is there on Excel.

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.710
That looks pretty good,
doesn't it?

00:55:58.710 --> 00:56:01.670
I'm going to do more for you.

00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:03.600
Which one is the real
stock market?

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:05.230
I find that hard
to tell, right?

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:12.660
The insight is that people get
deceived when they look at

00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:14.110
stock price charts.

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:16.050
They think they see patterns.

00:56:16.050 --> 00:56:19.840
That pink line is guaranteed to
have no patterns, because I

00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:22.750
generated it, so that there
are no patterns,

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:24.390
except random patterns.

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:27.135
But when I look at this pink
line, which just came up, look

00:56:27.135 --> 00:56:28.310
at that up-trend.

00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:29.300
Wow.

00:56:29.300 --> 00:56:31.860
That's called a bull market,
when it goes up.

00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:34.520
And I can make all kinds of
theories about why that's

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.970
happening, but you know those
would be fake theories,

00:56:36.970 --> 00:56:38.600
because I know what's
really happening.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:40.970
This is pure randomness.

00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:44.290
I'll do it again, I can
do this forever.

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:45.670
That's another one.

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:48.930
Here the trend wasn't
quite so positive.

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:51.550
Oh, actually, I have to say
one thing, I forgot.

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:53.413
I did put an up-trend
in the Random Walk.

00:56:53.413 --> 00:56:54.280
I am sorry.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:57:02.100
In this simulation, I did
add a constant, so that

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.200
it pushed it up.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:05.130
Otherwise, it was
a Random Walk.

00:57:05.130 --> 00:57:06.480
I forgot what I did.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.840
It was a Random Walk
with trend.

00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.860
But it doesn't guarantee
that it will go up,

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.210
because it's random.

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:13.460
I'll do another simulation.

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.960
See, how fast I can do these?

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:19.410
It's the wonder of
modern computers.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.760
If this were our history, people
would say, the amazing

00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.390
stock market of the first half
-- look at that stock market

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:30.320
in the first half of
the 20th century!

00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:33.850
We would be devising all kinds
of theories to explain it, but

00:57:33.850 --> 00:57:36.030
in fact it's just nonsense.

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:37.730
It's just randomness.

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:40.760
I'll do a few more.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:41.730
Look at that.

00:57:41.730 --> 00:57:43.280
Boy, that would be
a hump shape for

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:45.640
the whole 20th century.

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.410
We'd have historians trying
to figure that one out.

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:49.660
Oh, this one downturned.

00:57:49.660 --> 00:57:52.430
This is a bad outcome.

00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:55.420
Jeremy Siegel would not be
pleased with this outcome,

00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.200
because it has the stock
market gaining

00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.880
nothing in 100 years.

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:06.220
These are all equally
likely outcomes.

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:08.820
Look at that one.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.330
If that was the world that we
inherited, we would really

00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:15.740
think there was a linear trend
in the market, right?

00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:19.240
People would be making
models, saying --

00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:23.650
look at how straight
that line is.

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:26.880
The point is that you start to
see a sort of reality which is

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.420
really just randomness.

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:33.660
That's why Nassim Taleb, a
friend of mine, wrote a book

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:34.930
called Fooled by Randomness.

00:58:34.930 --> 00:58:36.520
I thought that was a
great title for a

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.110
book and a great book.

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:42.780
People don't understand how
things are just purely random,

00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:45.390
and your mind tries to make
sense out of them.

00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:48.000
And you start looking at
patterns and the patterns

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.840
don't mean anything.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:54.660
So, I can just keep doing this,
but maybe I'll stop.

00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:55.910
Look at that one.

00:58:58.590 --> 00:59:01.130
Of course, I'm helped along by
the trend that I added in.

00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:04.090
So, I want to see if I can
get a down-trend one.

00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:07.420
Because I put a trend in, it's
hard to get a real down-trend.

00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:09.550
That's sort of a down-trend.

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.260
That's where there were a
lot of negative shocks.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:16.890
So, you see the comparison of
the Random Walk with the

00:59:16.890 --> 00:59:18.450
actual stock market.

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:20.650
So, the actual stock
market looks a lot

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:22.060
like a random walk.

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.007
One thing is different, though,
you don't -- look at

00:59:24.007 --> 00:59:24.835
this pattern, here.

00:59:24.835 --> 00:59:29.360
In 1929, and this is the
crash, after '29.

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.980
You know, I'm not getting that
in any of my simulations, and

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:33.840
you know why I'm not?

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:37.540
Because I chose a normally
distributed shock.

00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:41.590
No fat tails, I didn't put fat
tails into my simulation.

00:59:41.590 --> 00:59:43.640
And you didn't notice
that, right?

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:48.830
But in this simulation, we never
see such sudden drops.

00:59:48.830 --> 00:59:51.890
So, there's something that, if
you spend time searching on

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:53.720
it, you might see something
not quite right.

00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:57.340
But basically, the Random Walk
looks a lot like the actual

00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.980
stock market.

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:03.960
I'm trying to get one that
really matches up, but I'm not

01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:05.930
quite succeeding.

01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:09.550
That's pretty good, isn't it?

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:13.640
In this simulation, 1929 wasn't
quite as strong and the

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.030
Depression wasn't as bad.

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:18.460
Anyway, what I want to do now
is compare the Random Walk

01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:19.710
with the AR-1.

01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.860
Now I'm going to do the same
thing, but I'm going

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.110
to do it with --

01:00:31.690 --> 01:01:13.520
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.900
PROFESSOR ROBERT SHILLER: I
know what I did, sorry.

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:20.220
The pink line is now
an AR-1 process,

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.680
which is this process.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:26.000
So, it's mean reverting now.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.770
I'm not comparing the Random
Walk with the AR-1, I'm just

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:33.030
doing the same thing
now with an AR-1.

01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:37.210
Now, the thing about AR-1 is,
you realize that it wants to

01:01:37.210 --> 01:01:40.080
come back to 100.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:43.550
I put a trend in.

01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:47.350
So, it's actually coming back
to a linear up-trend.

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:55.120
What I did is I put in
a time trend as well.

01:01:58.420 --> 01:02:02.825
But the point is that it tends
to hug the trend somewhat.

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:08.450
I have it here shown
not around a

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:10.230
trend, but around 100.

01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:12.530
What an AR-1 does is,
say rho is 1/2.

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:20.650
If rho is 1/2, then it means
that if x sub t minus 1 was

01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:21.510
above 100 --

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:23.380
last period it was
above 100 --

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:26.790
it will be above 100 this time,
but only half as much

01:02:26.790 --> 01:02:30.570
above 100, so it's going
back to 100.

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:34.000
And then the next time, it'll
only be half, again, as much

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.200
above 100 as it was
the last time.

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:40.390
So, it tends to go
back to a trend.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:44.700
But what I've shown here is
a simulation with a random

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:52.800
number generator of an AR-1
around a trend, where the

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:55.245
trend matches the actual trend
in the stock market.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.070
Now, in this case, this
is not Random Walk.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:05.660
And there is a profit
opportunity, and the profit

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:09.350
opportunity is when it's below
trend, buy, when it's above

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:10.760
trend, sell.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.550
Because it will tend to
come back to trend.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:19.165
I chose a rho which was very
small, something like 1/2, so

01:03:19.165 --> 01:03:22.460
it tends to come rapidly
back to trend.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:24.830
This does look different than
the actual stock market,

01:03:24.830 --> 01:03:26.570
doesn't it?

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:29.890
You see how much it
hugs the trend?

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:33.630
So, it doesn't seem
to fit as well.

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:35.610
I can do simulations
of this, too.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:41.760
This is different.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.380
You can see the difference,
right?

01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:47.650
This pink line doesn't look as
much like the actual stock

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:52.620
market, because it really
wants this trend.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.220
We saw trendy ones occasionally,
by chance with a

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:59.900
Random Walk, but here we're
seeing it's always on a trend.

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:05.880
And so, in this world, if the
stock market were an AR-1,

01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.440
there would be a profitable
strategy.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.090
Always buy when it's below
trend, and sell when it's

01:04:10.090 --> 01:04:10.990
above trend.

01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:13.260
Because you know it'll come
back, you see how reliable

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:15.362
this comes back to a trend?

01:04:19.310 --> 01:04:21.430
So, you can see that there's a
fundamental difference, the

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:27.310
Random Walk seems to fit the
data better than the AR-1.

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:30.540
The Random Walk theory says
that stock prices

01:04:30.540 --> 01:04:33.630
are not mean reverting.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:36.590
Where they go from today
is all random.

01:04:36.590 --> 01:04:39.070
If they're above the historical
trend, it's

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:39.960
meaningless.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.970
The historical trend
is just nonsense.

01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:43.230
It's just random.

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:46.450
And forget trends,
forget anything.

01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:49.020
It's always the drunk at the
lamp post, no matter where you

01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:51.410
are in history.

01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:54.970
This one, if rho is
substantially less than 1, it

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:57.920
looks a lot different
doesn't it?

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:01.550
With rho equals 1/2, this is
not the world we live in.

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:03.690
It would be too easy
to make money.

01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:06.420
All these little oscillations
around the trend I could

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:07.410
profit from.

01:05:07.410 --> 01:05:09.810
But in the real world,
it's not like that.

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:19.000
But suppose the real world is
AR-1 with rho equal to 0.99.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.070
What about that?

01:05:21.070 --> 01:05:24.070
Well that's not much different
from a Random Walk, is it?

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:25.720
It's going to be hard to
tell the difference.

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:33.050
In the Efficient Markets Theory
period, people were

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:36.100
really excited about the
Random Walk Hypothesis.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:40.156
That's why Burton Malkiel's
book, A Random Walk Down Wall

01:05:40.156 --> 01:05:41.750
Street, which he came
out with --

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:44.870
I think it was in 1973,
right after Fama.

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:50.120
It became a huge best seller, it
sold over a million copies,

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:53.810
because at that time people
were thinking, this is

01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:56.160
exciting new wisdom.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:59.130
We've learned that the stock
market is a Random Walk.

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:01.790
And there's all kinds of
implications for that.

01:06:01.790 --> 01:06:02.860
The problem is --

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:05.170
I have to wrap up --

01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.790
that the Random Walk Hypothesis

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:10.340
wasn't exactly right.

01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:13.380
It's sort of right, you've
gotten some insights.

01:06:13.380 --> 01:06:16.840
But you know, maybe the real
world is AR-1 with a

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.750
rho close to 1.

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:22.590
And in that world, there are
profit opportunities, but they

01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:24.760
take a long time to come.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:29.050
So, if the real world is AR-1
with rho equal to 0.99 or

01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:34.570
0.98, that means you
can buy stocks when

01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:35.950
they're below trend.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.680
But then you have to wait
10, 20 years for them

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.140
to get back to trend.

01:06:40.140 --> 01:06:44.350
So, it's like the drunk
on the lamp pole.

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:47.580
The drunk is standing next
to a lamp pole, it

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:48.530
was a random walk.

01:06:48.530 --> 01:06:51.520
But now we put in elastic band
around the drunk's ankle and

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.190
tie it to the lamp pole
and it pulls him back.

01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:58.440
Now, if we have a very loose
elastic, this guy can wander

01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:01.980
for a long time, but will
eventually be pulled back.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:04.440
You'd never know when.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:08.590
But if you have a tight elastic,
then it would be

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:11.170
obvious that the drunk
is coming back.

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:14.430
The problem is that the real
world seems, maybe, to be more

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.900
like the drunk with
the loose elastic.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.590
And so, it's kind
of unsatisfying.

01:07:18.590 --> 01:07:23.610
You can beat the market, but
simple trading rules like

01:07:23.610 --> 01:07:28.810
Edwards and McGee are not
powerful, short-run profit

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:29.610
opportunities.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:32.630
In that sense, the Efficient
Markets Hypothesis is right.

01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:34.800
So, don't forget the Efficient
Markets Hypothesis.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.130
I'll repeat what I said
at the beginning.

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:40.530
It's a half-truth,
it's half true.

01:07:40.530 --> 01:07:43.620
Remember that, but don't put too
much faith in it, either.

00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.206
Prof: King Abgar over in
the East Syrian region writes to

00:00:05.206 --> 00:00:07.284
Jesus saying,
"I've heard this great

00:00:07.284 --> 00:00:09.242
stuff about you,
I'm a little sick,

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:10.980
can you come heal me?
 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.230
The people in Jerusalem don't
like you, you'll find a nice

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.770
peaceful home here."
 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:23.001
Jesus wrote back apparently:
Blessed are you for believing

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:25.690
in me, although you have not
seen me.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.738
For it is written concerning me
that those who have seen me will

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:32.436
not believe me,
and that those who have not

00:00:32.436 --> 00:00:35.200
seen me they will believe and be
saved.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.250
But concerning what you wrote
to me namely to come to you,

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.899
it is necessary for me to
complete here all for which I

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.243
was sent,
and after the completion to be

00:00:46.243 --> 00:00:49.030
received up to Him that sent me.
 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.173
But when I am received up,
I shall send one of my

00:00:52.173 --> 00:00:56.168
disciples to you to heal your
affliction and to impart life to

00:00:56.168 --> 00:00:57.740
you and your people.
 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.548
There you have it.
 

00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:06.043
Letter from King Abgar to
Jesus, a letter to Jesus back to

00:01:06.043 --> 00:01:08.510
King Abgar;
do you believe it?

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.659
Kind of go like this or like
this.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.650
Come on take a stand.
 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.330
Go out on a limb.
 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.504
Decide you're just going to do
something wild and crazy and

00:01:21.504 --> 00:01:22.799
have an opinion.
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.040
Do you believe that those
letters are authentic?

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.730
No.
 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.310
Does anybody believe they're
authentic?

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.319
If so I've got some land I want
to sell you.

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:36.568
Nobody believes that the
letters from King Abgar to Jesus

00:01:36.568 --> 00:01:40.361
are authentic letters,
and nobody believes that the

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:43.700
letter from Jesus to Abgar is
authentic.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.739
We believe they are
pseudepigrapha;

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:49.330
remember this from before?
 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.510
What's the meaning of anonymity?
 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.430
Name me a document in the New
Testament that is anonymous.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.629
Student:  The Gospels.
 

00:02:00.629 --> 00:02:02.790
Prof: The Gospels,
exactly.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.950
The names in the Gospels were
added by later scribes.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.772
They weren't part of the
original document,

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:09.246
so they're not pseudonymous,
because the Gospel of Matthew

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:11.460
actually doesn't claim itself to
be by Matthew.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.718
It just is out there,
so they're anonymous.

00:02:13.718 --> 00:02:15.810
The letter to the Hebrews is
anonymous;

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.919
it doesn't even claim to be by
Paul or by anybody else that we

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:19.430
know of.
 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.830
It's just a letter that's there
in the text.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.848
The text is just there by
itself.

00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:29.391
Name me a document we've talked
about that is pseudonymous,

00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:30.520
anybody?
 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.979
What?
 

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:33.240
Student:  I,
II, III John.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.476
Prof: I,
II, III John,

00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:36.330
actually they don't claim to be
by John.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.139
That's again anonymous letters.
 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.699
We will get to them today.
 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:44.170
Pseudonimity means it claims to
be by someone who it's not by,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.220
who we just don't believe it's
by.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.347
The letters of Abgar--the
letter of Abgar to Jesus and of

00:02:49.347 --> 00:02:51.190
Jesus to Abgar,
scholars call that

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.139
pseudonymous.
 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.097
They're written in their names
but we don't believe they

00:02:54.097 --> 00:02:54.878
actually wrote them.
 

00:02:54.878 --> 00:02:59.086
Now why do you say you don't
believe those letters are

00:02:59.086 --> 00:03:00.038
authentic?
 

00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:04.715
I mean obviously the tone of my
voice, I was messing with them,

00:03:04.715 --> 00:03:07.430
so that could have tipped you
off.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.050
And you may think,
well I've just never heard that

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.530
there was an actual letter of
Jesus of Nazareth that survives,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.122
so you would think that you
would have heard about that in

00:03:16.122 --> 00:03:18.941
The New York Times
if there actually was one that

00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:19.758
was authentic.
 

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:24.051
What else about the letters
that you heard might tip you off

00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:26.090
that they're pseudonymous?
 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.008
Yes sir.
 

00:03:28.008 --> 00:03:29.836
Student:  If the letter
was written in Greek then that

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:30.720
would be a good indication.
 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.248
Prof: Exactly,
the letters are written in

00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:33.680
Greek.
 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.389
If the letters are written in
Greek--

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.120
well we don't really have any
evidence that Jesus spoke Greek,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.638
and if he did speak Greek he
probably didn't write Greek at

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:45.460
the literary level that those
letters were obviously written.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.530
I mean I don't know if you
noticed but there's a certain

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.925
style to them,
even in the English

00:03:48.925 --> 00:03:51.232
translation, that sounds like
these are written by educated

00:03:51.232 --> 00:03:51.628
people.
 

00:03:51.628 --> 00:03:53.758
They know how to write good
letter forms.

00:03:53.758 --> 00:03:56.986
Jesus--we don't know anything
about King Abgar much but we can

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.215
certainly say that most of us
don't believe Jesus had the kind

00:04:00.215 --> 00:04:03.283
of education that he could have
written a Greek letter like

00:04:03.283 --> 00:04:04.699
that,
so that's one indication.

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.030
Anything else?
 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.218
Yes sir.
 

00:04:09.218 --> 00:04:10.240
Student:  Sounds like
the Gospel of John.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.919
Prof: It sounds like the
Gospel of John exactly.

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.691
Remember the line that said,
some people have seen me and

00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:17.769
not believed in me,
it's just almost like a

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.649
quotation from the Gospel of
John.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:22.615
You kind of think,
this sounds like something that

00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:25.944
some Christian scribe would
write long after the life of

00:04:25.944 --> 00:04:26.550
Jesus.
 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.509
And why not?
 

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:29.593
I mean, if you're a Christian
scribe living in the third

00:04:29.593 --> 00:04:31.225
century,
some scholars date these

00:04:31.225 --> 00:04:33.726
letters to around 250,
the year 250 or so,

00:04:33.726 --> 00:04:37.170
that's a guess but--
if you're a scribe living in

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.267
around the year 250,
and to you Jesus is the Son of

00:04:41.267 --> 00:04:42.278
God,
he's divine,

00:04:42.278 --> 00:04:43.759
he's this miracle--he's
powerful,

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.259
he's a miracle,
he's the emperor of the cosmos,

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.220
the world.
 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.620
And so you kind of think in
your popular mindset,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.653
well, why wouldn't kings who
lived during the time of Jesus

00:04:52.653 --> 00:04:54.850
have heard about him and know
about him?

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.709
He did all these miraculous
deeds;

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:58.850
wouldn't he have been world
famous?

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.350
In fact a lot of modern people
have the same idea.

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.353
They're very surprised when
they realize that Jesus

00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:07.899
actually--nobody knew anything
about him in his lifetime.

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:11.560
They say, but he did all these
miracles and the Gospel--

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.588
these crowds that followed him
and these kinds of things,

00:05:13.588 --> 00:05:16.920
wouldn't that really have made
the headlines of the time?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.615
You say, well there actually
were a lot of miracle workers

00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:21.269
running around the ancient
world.

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:23.226
There were a lot of prophets;
there were a lot of people

00:05:23.226 --> 00:05:24.129
claiming to raise the dead.
 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.009
It wasn't that unusual a thing.
 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:28.569
So, no, Jesus wasn't famous
during his own lifetime.

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:31.350
But you can imagine how a
scribe, a Christian scribe,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.855
in the middle of the third
century would naturally think

00:05:33.855 --> 00:05:36.680
that this person he worships as
Lord must have been famous,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:39.134
and, therefore,
it's entirely believable that

00:05:39.134 --> 00:05:41.923
there could have been
correspondences between Jesus

00:05:41.923 --> 00:05:45.752
and kings around the world,
and so these letters get made

00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:48.709
up as part of just basic
Christian piety.

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:52.069
If the letters didn't exist,
they ought to exist,

00:05:52.069 --> 00:05:53.610
so we'll write them.
 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.389
We have other examples of
pseudonimity.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.290
We have, for example,
letters between Paul and the

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.115
philosopher Seneca,
which nobody believes they're

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:06.759
authentic,
nobody believes that the

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.238
philosopher Seneca,
who is the aide if you recall,

00:06:09.238 --> 00:06:10.379
to the Emperor Nero.
 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.904
He was an advisor to Nero until
he fell out of favor,

00:06:12.904 --> 00:06:15.480
and Nero kicked him out and all
that sort of thing.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.610
But Seneca was one of the most
famous first century Stoic

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.449
philosophers.
 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.470
Somebody wrote letters years
later which Seneca writes to

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:25.911
Paul and says,
you are such a great

00:06:25.911 --> 00:06:27.420
philosopher Paul.
 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.283
I wonder if we could get
together and have a little

00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:29.879
coffee klatch?
 

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.894
Paul writes back and says,
I'm really busy right now but

00:06:32.894 --> 00:06:35.910
we've got some--so they write
letters back and forth.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.089
We have all kinds of things.
 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:40.970
These are not just Christian
letters.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.382
There are a whole bunch of
letters written under the names

00:06:44.382 --> 00:06:46.540
of very famous Cynic
philosophers.

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.521
Now the word "cynic"
in this context doesn't mean

00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:51.990
just the adjective for someone
who is cynical.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.834
It comes from the Greek word
for "dog,"

00:06:53.834 --> 00:06:56.069
kunos,
and certain--there's a certain

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.257
philosophical movement in the
ancient world in which certain

00:06:59.257 --> 00:07:00.754
men,
and in a few cases,

00:07:00.754 --> 00:07:04.230
women, tried to teach that you
should live completely according

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.959
to nature.
 

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:07.235
For example,
if it's natural to eat and have

00:07:07.235 --> 00:07:10.408
sex then you should--there's
nothing shameful about eating or

00:07:10.408 --> 00:07:12.050
having sex, even in public.
 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:14.151
If it's natural for people to
follow their desires,

00:07:14.151 --> 00:07:15.959
then you should just follow
your desires.

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:19.512
And so these Cynics got called
"doggie philosophers"

00:07:19.512 --> 00:07:21.889
by other people,
because they did the kinds of

00:07:21.889 --> 00:07:24.519
stuff that humans don't do in
public but dogs do in public.

00:07:24.519 --> 00:07:28.579
Or they also got the nickname
for several other reasons.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:31.591
Somebody in late antiquity
decided that they wanted a

00:07:31.591 --> 00:07:35.007
series of letters that talk
about the philosophy of Cynicism

00:07:35.007 --> 00:07:38.307
and so they have letters back
and forth under the names of

00:07:38.307 --> 00:07:41.839
famous philosophers of the Cynic
movement which talk about the

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:45.430
morality of the Cynic movement
or debate different issues about

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:47.110
the Cynic movement.
 

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:49.540
There are all kinds--letters of
Plato,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.569
we have a big difficulty trying
to figure out,

00:07:51.569 --> 00:07:55.211
are all the letters that exist
in ancient Greek manuscripts

00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:58.540
that claim to be letters of the
philosopher Plato,

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.290
are they really by Plato?
 

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:03.660
Almost no scholar believes they
all are by Plato.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.584
Many scholars believe that at
least some of the letters that

00:08:06.584 --> 00:08:09.259
have been passed down over
tradition being by Plato may

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:12.088
really be by Plato,
but certainly not all of them.

00:08:12.088 --> 00:08:17.343
The phenomenon of
pseudepigraphy,

00:08:17.343 --> 00:08:21.238
that is,
writings under a false name,

00:08:21.238 --> 00:08:23.608
was very,
very popular in the ancient

00:08:23.608 --> 00:08:26.480
world, and we have all kinds of
evidences for it.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.370
Now you have to imagine how
would this work?

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:34.570
How would, for example,
these letters be produced?

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.413
Well I've said Christians might
do it because it's a work of

00:08:37.413 --> 00:08:37.798
piety.
 

00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:39.798
They think that these letters
ought to exist.

00:08:39.798 --> 00:08:41.582
But then you have to say,
well how would they have been

00:08:41.582 --> 00:08:41.980
published?
 

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:44.308
Remember we don't have printing
presses,

00:08:44.308 --> 00:08:47.797
so you can't just send
something off anonymously or

00:08:47.797 --> 00:08:51.086
pseudonymously to a publisher,
and just try to get it

00:08:51.086 --> 00:08:52.570
published with a printing press.
 

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.090
Everything's done one copy,
by one copy by hand.

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.109
Everything in the ancient world
has to be copied by hand,

00:08:59.109 --> 00:09:00.350
one letter at a time.
 

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:03.058
In fact, they did copy one
letter at a time.

00:09:03.058 --> 00:09:06.142
You can tell by reading
manuscripts: they're almost all

00:09:06.142 --> 00:09:08.543
capital letters;
they're kind of block capital

00:09:08.543 --> 00:09:10.960
letters, and they don't have
spaces between words.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.999
Most of the time,
they don't have spaces often

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:15.174
between sentences,
and you can tell these scribes

00:09:15.174 --> 00:09:17.168
are copying one letter at a
time, often.

00:09:17.168 --> 00:09:19.788
And that's why we get so many
mistakes in our New Testament

00:09:19.788 --> 00:09:20.418
manuscripts.
 

00:09:20.418 --> 00:09:23.124
We have thousands of New
Testament manuscripts,

00:09:23.124 --> 00:09:26.240
and there's not two of them
that are alike exactly.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.596
We have more mistakes in
New--in the Greek copies of the

00:09:29.596 --> 00:09:33.381
New Testament than we even have
manuscripts of the Greek copies

00:09:33.381 --> 00:09:36.808
of the New Testament,
and that's in the thousands.

00:09:36.808 --> 00:09:39.150
Nobody knows how many mistakes
we have in the Greek New

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.798
Testament and different
manuscripts.

00:09:40.798 --> 00:09:42.376
There are so many,
nobody's ever been able to

00:09:42.376 --> 00:09:44.600
count them, and it would be
almost impossible to count them.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.765
The reason we have this is
because it all had to be done

00:09:47.765 --> 00:09:50.759
one letter by one letter,
one scribe with one scribe,

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:52.658
and that's why you have them.
 

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:55.279
You have to imagine,
then, if you want to publish a

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:58.371
letter from King Abgar to Jesus
and then a letter from Jesus

00:09:58.371 --> 00:10:00.970
back to King Abgar,
well how do you do it?

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.712
Well, you know you're a scribe
so you write up these letters

00:10:03.712 --> 00:10:06.501
and then maybe you write up a
few copies and send them around

00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:08.381
to people,
or show them to people,

00:10:08.381 --> 00:10:11.208
or you might claim that you
found this in a library of a

00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:14.392
monastery where you work,
or you might just send it to a

00:10:14.392 --> 00:10:17.269
book seller and get the book
seller to notice it,

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:20.298
or you might put it in a page
of another manuscript.

00:10:20.298 --> 00:10:23.370
Say you're compiling a
manuscript,

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.730
a book that has the different
Gospels,

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.280
and you decide,
I'm going to put this on the

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.009
back fly leaf of this book that
I'm copying.

00:10:31.009 --> 00:10:34.738
Pseudepigraphic letters were
distributed and recopied and

00:10:34.738 --> 00:10:36.470
passed around the world.
 

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.361
It's not a Christian phenomenon;
it's not just a Jewish

00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:39.789
phenomenon.
 

00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:41.519
Everybody was doing it.
 

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:44.951
Today we get to the first two
letters we're going to talk

00:10:44.951 --> 00:10:46.788
about of the Pauline Corpus.
 

00:10:46.788 --> 00:10:49.879
The last time we talked about
the seven undisputed letters of

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:50.240
Paul.
 

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.273
Now we're going to get to the
time where we talk about the

00:10:53.273 --> 00:10:54.710
disputed letters of Paul.
 

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:57.808
Remember I've talked about how
Paul's letters can be divided up

00:10:57.808 --> 00:11:00.697
into three camps,
the undisputed seven letters

00:11:00.697 --> 00:11:02.616
which are listed--
I've already listed them for

00:11:02.616 --> 00:11:03.460
you and I'm not going to do it
now,

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.831
they're also in your textbook,
and then there's the letters

00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:09.543
that almost all scholars,
critical scholars,

00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:13.652
believe are pseudepigraphic,
which are I and II Timothy and

00:11:13.652 --> 00:11:14.190
Titus.
 

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.625
Then there are the disputed
letters that some scholars will

00:11:17.625 --> 00:11:20.826
accept as being by Paul and
other scholars doubt are by

00:11:20.826 --> 00:11:21.360
Paul.
 

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.860
The two that are the most
debated probably now are

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.788
Colossians and Ephesians.
 

00:11:26.788 --> 00:11:29.447
Some people,
like me, say that they're not

00:11:29.447 --> 00:11:32.428
written by Paul,
but they're pseudepigrapha.

00:11:32.428 --> 00:11:34.190
And some people say they are
written by Paul.

00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.990
Yes sir.
 

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:36.480
Student:  What is the
church's opinion on the letters?

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.107
Prof: The church's--
Student:  The Catholic

00:11:39.107 --> 00:11:39.308
Church.
 

00:11:39.308 --> 00:11:41.830
Prof: The Roman Catholic
Church?

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.352
The Roman Catholic Church
traditionally would have said

00:11:44.352 --> 00:11:46.970
there's no such thing as
pseudepigraphy in the Bible,

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.190
but that's changed in the
twentieth century,

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.950
especially with Vatican II,
which happened in the 1960s.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.644
The Roman Catholic Council of
Vatican II said that historical

00:11:56.644 --> 00:11:59.971
criticism as it's practiced in
the twentieth century is

00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:04.158
perfectly legitimate to practice
on the New Testament documents.

00:12:04.158 --> 00:12:07.701
So you will even find good
faithful Roman Catholic scholars

00:12:07.701 --> 00:12:11.490
who will also either accept or
reject the Pauline authorship of

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:12.038
this.
 

00:12:12.038 --> 00:12:15.741
The Roman Catholic Church has
no official doctrinal position

00:12:15.741 --> 00:12:19.320
on the authorship of the
different pieces of the Bible.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.220
They may have at one time just
assumed that everything that

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.668
says it's written by Paul was
written by Paul,

00:12:24.668 --> 00:12:28.635
but especially since Vatican II
Roman Catholic scholars are

00:12:28.635 --> 00:12:32.602
completely free to make their
own decision about this based

00:12:32.602 --> 00:12:35.817
purely on the kinds of
historical and linguistic

00:12:35.817 --> 00:12:39.168
criteria that Protestant
scholars use also.

00:12:39.168 --> 00:12:42.779
Any other questions before I
move on?

00:12:42.779 --> 00:12:47.408
Why do I say that Colossians
and Ephesians were not written

00:12:47.408 --> 00:12:50.759
by Paul but by a disciple of
Paul later?

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:54.090
The main reason I want to give
is writing style.

00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:59.058
Just like if you turn in a
paper to your teaching fellow,

00:12:59.058 --> 00:13:01.679
and say the first paper that
you turned in early in the

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:04.349
semester was written in a
certain kind of style and then

00:13:04.349 --> 00:13:07.649
you turn in the second paper and
it's in a very different style.

00:13:07.649 --> 00:13:09.928
Say it has very elaborate
sentences whereas your first

00:13:09.928 --> 00:13:11.606
paper had sort of
straightforward simple

00:13:11.606 --> 00:13:12.210
sentences.
 

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:15.789
It uses lots of dependent
clauses whereas your first paper

00:13:15.789 --> 00:13:18.240
didn't use so many dependent
clauses.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:21.389
Your first paper used rather
simple language,

00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:23.889
your second paper uses all this
kind of language,

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:27.943
and you either have all of a
sudden gotten a different kind

00:13:27.943 --> 00:13:31.860
of education or you went
thesaurus crazy or something.

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:35.216
So your teaching fellow might
say, I'm getting suspicious that

00:13:35.216 --> 00:13:38.740
this letter doesn't look like
it's written by the same person.

00:13:38.740 --> 00:13:40.610
We can tell things by writing
style.

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:44.607
Now you've read seven letters
that almost all scholars believe

00:13:44.607 --> 00:13:46.048
Paul actually wrote.
 

00:13:46.048 --> 00:13:50.712
Here is the way Colossians
starts out, this is Colossians

00:13:50.712 --> 00:13:51.379
1:3-8.
 

00:13:51.379 --> 00:13:56.000
In fact, get your Bibles out,
follow along with me because

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.730
what is our motto for the
semester's course?

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.950
De omnibus dubitandum,
doubt everything.

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.750
Why do you bring your Bibles to
class?

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.678
Because I'll lie to you,
exactly.

00:14:09.678 --> 00:14:15.346
I'm going to read my own
translation of Colossians 1:3-8,

00:14:15.346 --> 00:14:18.990
notice this is a good five
verses.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.692
I read my translation because
you will notice in your

00:14:22.692 --> 00:14:26.323
translation that the editors
have broken up this one

00:14:26.323 --> 00:14:27.250
sentence.
 

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.340
This is all one sentence in
Greek.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.091
The editors have broken it up
into several different sentences

00:14:32.091 --> 00:14:34.620
because it just doesn't read
like an English sentence.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.148
Here's what it is in Greek:
We give thanks to God the

00:14:38.148 --> 00:14:41.940
Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
always for you when we pray,

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.499
hearing of your faithfulness in
Christ Jesus and the love which

00:14:45.499 --> 00:14:48.139
you have toward all the holy
ones [that is,

00:14:48.139 --> 00:14:50.517
the saints]
because of the hope laid in

00:14:50.517 --> 00:14:54.010
store for you in the heavens,
which hope you heard about

00:14:54.010 --> 00:14:57.740
before in the word of the truth
of the Gospel that came to you,

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.960
just as also in all the cosmos
it is bearing fruit and growing,

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.375
just as also among you from
which day you heard and

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:08.038
recognize the grace of God in
truth,

00:15:08.038 --> 00:15:11.769
just as you learned from
Epaphras, our beloved co-slave,

00:15:11.769 --> 00:15:14.807
who is your trustworthy servant
of Christ and who also made

00:15:14.807 --> 00:15:16.799
clear to us your love in the
spirit.

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:19.200
One sentence.
 

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.912
Notice how yours was chopped up
into several other clauses and

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:24.129
smaller sentences.
 

00:15:24.129 --> 00:15:28.188
I kept using relative pronouns
like "who did this,"

00:15:28.188 --> 00:15:31.370
"which this,"
and using ing-words,

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.615
participles,
because that's what you use in

00:15:33.615 --> 00:15:36.879
the Greek to string along clause
after clause after clause.

00:15:36.879 --> 00:15:40.408
Now if you turn in a sentence
like this, expect to get a C on

00:15:40.408 --> 00:15:43.879
your paper because this is not
good American English writing

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:44.879
style, right?
 

00:15:44.879 --> 00:15:47.389
You recognize that now,
don't you, right?

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:49.253
Nod your head;
yes we recognize that's not

00:15:49.253 --> 00:15:51.320
good English writing style in
contemporary America.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.514
But it actually was pretty good
writing style in the nineteenth

00:15:54.514 --> 00:15:55.029
century.
 

00:15:55.029 --> 00:15:57.649
Sometimes in the--you read
older English and they--

00:15:57.649 --> 00:16:00.193
educated writers will often
write with these complex

00:16:00.193 --> 00:16:02.999
sentences with dependent clause,
and dependent clause,

00:16:02.999 --> 00:16:05.168
and dependent clause all
nestled together.

00:16:05.168 --> 00:16:08.837
That's called periodic style,
a period is this looping Greek

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:12.505
or Latin sentence that loops
around on itself and then comes

00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:14.308
into this nice big whole.
 

00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:17.460
Now that was a good writing
style in Latin,

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.950
it was a good writing style in
ancient classical Greek,

00:16:19.950 --> 00:16:23.049
and so this writer is actually
writing in a fine style;

00:16:23.049 --> 00:16:23.990
there's nothing bad.
 

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:26.523
Just because our styles have
changed, and it's no longer

00:16:26.523 --> 00:16:28.688
considered good writing style in
modern English,

00:16:28.688 --> 00:16:30.668
but it was good writing style
in Greek.

00:16:30.668 --> 00:16:33.259
And you can recognize it when
you read it in the original

00:16:33.259 --> 00:16:35.940
Greek in a way that you can't
recognize it so much when you

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.788
read it in your English
translation.

00:16:37.788 --> 00:16:44.182
Now here's the first
sentence--not the first sentence

00:16:44.182 --> 00:16:49.470
but Ephesians 1:3-14,
again one sentence.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.070
Now if you thought that
Colossians sentence was long,

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.120
listen to this one.
 

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.058
Blessed be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:16:57.058 --> 00:16:59.884
who blessed us with every
spiritual blessing in the

00:16:59.884 --> 00:17:02.798
heavenlies in Christ,
just as he chose us in him

00:17:02.798 --> 00:17:05.078
before the foundation of the
cosmos,

00:17:05.078 --> 00:17:08.109
that we might be holy and
blameless in his presence and

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.391
love,
having foreordained for us the

00:17:10.391 --> 00:17:13.463
sonship [or the adoption],
through Jesus Christ for

00:17:13.463 --> 00:17:16.476
himself, according to the
pleasure of his will for the

00:17:16.476 --> 00:17:18.578
praise of the glory of his
grace,

00:17:18.578 --> 00:17:20.630
which he granted us and the one
he loves,

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.180
in whom we have the washing
through his blood,

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:24.988
the forgiveness of
transgressions,

00:17:24.988 --> 00:17:27.180
according to the riches of his
grace,

00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:30.400
which he lavished on us in all
wisdom and prudence,

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.282
making known to us the mystery
of his will according to his

00:17:33.282 --> 00:17:35.462
pleasure,
which he set forth previously

00:17:35.462 --> 00:17:38.740
in him until the building up of
the fullness of the times,

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.288
recapitulating everything in
Christ,

00:17:41.288 --> 00:17:43.400
things in the heavens and on
the earth in him,

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.940
in whom also we have become
heirs foreordained,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:49.190
according to the plan of the
one who accomplishes everything,

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.175
according to the plan of his
will, so that we might exist for

00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:55.279
the praise of his glory,
we who were the first to hope

00:17:55.279 --> 00:17:58.215
in Christ in whom also you,
hearing the word of truth,

00:17:58.215 --> 00:17:59.890
the announcement of your
salvation,

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.631
and in whom also you believed,
who were sealed with the

00:18:02.631 --> 00:18:05.778
promise of the Holy Spirit which
is the seal of our inheritance

00:18:05.778 --> 00:18:08.519
for the washing of the
possession for the praise of his

00:18:08.519 --> 00:18:09.130
glory.
 

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:13.380
Thank you very much.
 

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.759
It sounds like--who's the
comedian?

00:18:16.759 --> 00:18:18.009
George Carlin doesn't it?
 

00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:21.233
It sounds like something George
Carlin would come up with,

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:23.893
this stringing together all
this stuff together,

00:18:23.893 --> 00:18:25.759
that's actually one sentence.
 

00:18:25.759 --> 00:18:30.038
In Greek it's 201 words by my
last count,

00:18:30.038 --> 00:18:32.728
or incidentally,
when I translated this into

00:18:32.728 --> 00:18:36.416
English it actually comes out to
be 250 words in the English

00:18:36.416 --> 00:18:38.930
translation,
so that's a long sentence.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:43.230
Now I do all that just to say
this is a good lesson,

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:46.803
you should learn Greek,
you should learn Greek because

00:18:46.803 --> 00:18:50.848
it's actually fun to read some
of these texts in the original

00:18:50.848 --> 00:18:54.692
language because the English
translations change it enough

00:18:54.692 --> 00:18:57.390
that you don't get the feel of
it.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:58.940
You can get the feel of it even
in English.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.663
If you sit there and read all
those verses in the first

00:19:02.663 --> 00:19:05.355
chapter of Ephesians,
just in your own English

00:19:05.355 --> 00:19:07.685
translation,
you'll get some of that rhythm

00:19:07.685 --> 00:19:11.195
because they try to maintain a
little bit of that long kind of

00:19:11.195 --> 00:19:11.828
feeling.
 

00:19:11.828 --> 00:19:15.461
But it's only in Greek that you
figure out that this is one

00:19:15.461 --> 00:19:16.150
sentence.
 

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:21.859
Now Paul is capable of writing
a complex sentence like that,

00:19:21.859 --> 00:19:23.990
but he just doesn't.
 

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.640
You can search all the way
through the seven authentic

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.490
letters of Paul and you just
tell--

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.778
especially the Ephesians
passage, it just doesn't sound

00:19:31.778 --> 00:19:32.509
like Paul.
 

00:19:32.509 --> 00:19:34.808
Paul writes fairly
straightforward sentences.

00:19:34.808 --> 00:19:36.960
Sometimes they have grammatical
problems,

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.640
sometimes he kind of starts and
stops,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.538
sometimes it's hard to figure
out exactly,

00:19:40.538 --> 00:19:43.710
syntactically,
how a sentence works together,

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:47.150
but Paul's capable of writing
perfectly fine Greek sentences.

00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:50.813
But Paul writes his letters
almost more the way you would

00:19:50.813 --> 00:19:53.298
expect somebody to talk,
not like this,

00:19:53.298 --> 00:19:56.440
which is very elaborate in its
construction.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.767
This author is obviously
working to make an elaborate

00:19:59.767 --> 00:20:03.862
introductory sentence that's the
first thing that's heard in this

00:20:03.862 --> 00:20:07.509
congregation who's hearing this
letter read out loud.

00:20:07.509 --> 00:20:10.596
One of the first things that I
would say is that I just don't

00:20:10.596 --> 00:20:13.684
think these letters are by Paul
because they don't sound like

00:20:13.684 --> 00:20:15.390
Paul,
they don't sound like his style.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:17.694
They're very,
very different as far just the

00:20:17.694 --> 00:20:19.680
style of the writing and the
Greek.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:21.726
Other people could say,
well there's also the

00:20:21.726 --> 00:20:24.191
vocabulary, the vocabulary is
quite a bit different in

00:20:24.191 --> 00:20:25.538
Colossians and Ephesians.
 

00:20:25.538 --> 00:20:29.726
If you noticed the Colossians
sentence was long but it was not

00:20:29.726 --> 00:20:32.883
nearly as elaborate as that
Ephesians sentence,

00:20:32.883 --> 00:20:33.568
right?
 

00:20:33.568 --> 00:20:36.098
If you notice they sounded
similar in places.

00:20:36.098 --> 00:20:38.170
They both talk about the
heavenlies.

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:42.682
It's the plural for heaven,
so the heavens or the heavenly

00:20:42.682 --> 00:20:44.900
places is this Greek word.
 

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.288
They both used that kind of
language.

00:20:46.288 --> 00:20:48.282
As we'll go through,
they both--Colossians and

00:20:48.282 --> 00:20:50.228
Ephesians--
look a lot alike,

00:20:50.228 --> 00:20:53.769
both in their theology and in
their style,

00:20:53.769 --> 00:20:56.269
and in even the structure of
the two letters.

00:20:56.269 --> 00:20:59.038
Were they written by the same
person?

00:20:59.038 --> 00:21:02.266
Some people think so,
some people say they think it's

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:06.113
more likely that Paul may have
written Colossians because it at

00:21:06.113 --> 00:21:09.960
least is not so different from
some of his other letters,

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.770
and then they'll say,
but a pseudonymous writer wrote

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:13.420
Ephesians.
 

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.295
What I think is that Colossians
was written by one disciple of

00:21:17.295 --> 00:21:17.740
Paul.
 

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.672
He knew Pauline theology;
I think that he knew Paul's

00:21:20.672 --> 00:21:21.400
theology pretty well.
 

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:24.711
It's just that it's not--what
he ends up teaching in

00:21:24.711 --> 00:21:28.868
Colossians is not exactly Paul's
theology, as I'll show today.

00:21:28.868 --> 00:21:31.867
I think, though,
that Ephesians came along and

00:21:31.867 --> 00:21:35.798
was written by somebody else
using Colossians as a model.

00:21:35.798 --> 00:21:38.325
And that's why I think--if you
get Ephesians you have this

00:21:38.325 --> 00:21:40.394
long,
long, long sentence that is

00:21:40.394 --> 00:21:44.078
longer than the similar sentence
in Colossians but seems to

00:21:44.078 --> 00:21:45.538
borrow some from it.
 

00:21:45.538 --> 00:21:47.838
I think a different disciple
came around,

00:21:47.838 --> 00:21:50.160
knew about the letter to the
Colossians,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.340
used Colossians as a model,
and then wrote the letter to

00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.058
the Ephesians as another
pseudonymous letter.

00:21:56.058 --> 00:21:58.092
The way I'm going to teach
this--and this is something that

00:21:58.092 --> 00:21:59.598
some scholars won't agree with
me about,

00:21:59.598 --> 00:22:02.564
obviously--but I'm going to
take the seven undisputed

00:22:02.564 --> 00:22:04.558
letters of Paul as being by
Paul.

00:22:04.558 --> 00:22:08.128
Colossians I'm going to teach
is written by one disciple of

00:22:08.128 --> 00:22:11.576
Paul using his ideas but
elaborating them differently and

00:22:11.576 --> 00:22:14.098
using a very different writing
style.

00:22:14.098 --> 00:22:17.685
And Ephesians is written by
another disciple of Paul using

00:22:17.685 --> 00:22:20.329
Colossians and Paul's letters as
models.

00:22:20.329 --> 00:22:22.868
What is the issue?
 

00:22:22.868 --> 00:22:24.884
Let's start with Colossians
now, what is the issue in

00:22:24.884 --> 00:22:25.390
Colossians?
 

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:28.163
First I'll stop,
are there any questions or

00:22:28.163 --> 00:22:30.869
outbursts about what we've done
so far?

00:22:30.869 --> 00:22:32.500
Yes sir.
 

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:36.681
Student:  What says the
seven confirmed ones are his and

00:22:36.681 --> 00:22:38.568
the other two are not his?
 

00:22:38.568 --> 00:22:39.750
Why is one style his and one
style--

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.827
Prof: Okay the question
is what says that the seven that

00:22:42.827 --> 00:22:45.558
I've called the undisputed
letters are actually Paul and

00:22:45.558 --> 00:22:46.950
the others are not Paul?
 

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.188
In other words you--basically
what it is is that you've got to

00:22:50.188 --> 00:22:53.268
have something that you're
willing to say is Paul if you're

00:22:53.268 --> 00:22:55.868
ever going to say something else
is not Paul.

00:22:55.868 --> 00:22:58.698
The undisputed letters,
we just say that's the

00:22:58.698 --> 00:23:01.150
historical Paul,
if there's anything.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:04.470
Now of course there's a joke in
scholarship that basically says,

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.108
well the seven letters that are
the undisputed letters of Paul--

00:23:08.108 --> 00:23:11.130
called that by some scholars,
they weren't really written by

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:12.500
Paul,
they were written by another

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.048
guy named Paul.
 

00:23:13.048 --> 00:23:19.269
At some point you just have to
say,

00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:22.118
well we're going to posit that
there was a historical Paul,

00:23:22.118 --> 00:23:24.993
and if anything in the Bible
was written by that guy that

00:23:24.993 --> 00:23:27.509
we're going to assume was the
historical Paul,

00:23:27.509 --> 00:23:28.578
it's those seven letters.
 

00:23:28.578 --> 00:23:31.471
They have enough of the style
the same, they cohere well

00:23:31.471 --> 00:23:33.048
together, all seven of them.
 

00:23:33.048 --> 00:23:36.390
Now there are scholars who will
doubt some of those seven also,

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:38.332
one of the seven,
but it's sort of like somebody

00:23:38.332 --> 00:23:40.237
else said,
well I don't believe Romans and

00:23:40.237 --> 00:23:42.290
Galatians were by Paul,
than I kind of say,

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:45.144
well then they're written by
another Apostle who was named

00:23:45.144 --> 00:23:47.798
Paul and had the exact same
ideas and the same writing

00:23:47.798 --> 00:23:48.348
style.
 

00:23:48.348 --> 00:23:50.737
I mean I--at some point you
just have to throw up your

00:23:50.737 --> 00:23:52.450
hands, but yes it's a good
question.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.170
Basically scholars just start
off saying,

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.917
if there is a historical Paul
then what are the letters that

00:23:56.917 --> 00:23:59.338
look enough alike to form one
body of literature,

00:23:59.338 --> 00:24:00.960
and those are those seven
letters.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.618
Any other questions?
 

00:24:02.618 --> 00:24:06.160
Let's look at Colossians now
and go through it and talk about

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.759
what's at issue in Colossians
and what is this letter actually

00:24:09.759 --> 00:24:10.348
about?
 

00:24:10.348 --> 00:24:15.170
Now I asked you to read
Colossians before Ephesians,

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:19.528
although it comes after in the
Canon because I think Colossians

00:24:19.528 --> 00:24:22.130
predates Ephesians and instead
of--

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.269
basically you've got a choice.
 

00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:25.893
These are similar enough in
their style and content that you

00:24:25.893 --> 00:24:28.561
sort of have to say either the
same person wrote both of them

00:24:28.561 --> 00:24:30.430
and that's why they're so much
alike,

00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:31.963
or if you said,
like I did, that different

00:24:31.963 --> 00:24:34.104
people wrote them,
one of them used the other as a

00:24:34.104 --> 00:24:34.410
model.
 

00:24:34.410 --> 00:24:37.508
I argue that Colossians was
first and used as a model by

00:24:37.508 --> 00:24:40.719
Ephesians because I think
Colossians is more elaborated in

00:24:40.719 --> 00:24:42.240
the Ephesians document.
 

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.556
Of course Colossians doesn't
come before Ephesians even

00:24:44.556 --> 00:24:46.529
though I'm saying it was written
before it,

00:24:46.529 --> 00:24:50.220
and why does Colossians come
after Ephesians in the Canon?

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:53.381
You should be able to guess
this now if we haven't already

00:24:53.381 --> 00:24:54.380
talked about it.
 

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.038
I think we talked about it
earlier in the semester.

00:24:56.038 --> 00:25:00.740
Why does Colossians come after
Ephesians in the Canon?

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.880
Why does 1 Corinthians come
after Romans in the Canon?

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:08.410
Anybody want to make a guess?
 

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.970
How are the letters of Paul
arranged in the Canon by order?

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:15.019
Sorry, somebody said it.
 

00:25:15.019 --> 00:25:15.598
Student:  Length.
 

00:25:15.598 --> 00:25:17.818
Prof: Length,
exactly that's right.

00:25:17.818 --> 00:25:21.058
The longer letters are first,
and they get shorter as you go,

00:25:21.058 --> 00:25:24.416
so Colossians is shorter than
Ephesians and therefore it comes

00:25:24.416 --> 00:25:27.773
after Ephesians in the Canon but
that's just the way the Canon

00:25:27.773 --> 00:25:28.930
got to be formed.
 

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:31.839
Let's look and see what's going
on here and for this what is the

00:25:31.839 --> 00:25:32.210
issue?
 

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:36.291
Let's look at Colossians 2:16:
Therefore do not let anyone

00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:40.423
condemn you in matters of food
and drink, or of observing

00:25:40.423 --> 00:25:43.078
festivals, new moons or
Sabbaths.

00:25:43.078 --> 00:25:46.290
These are only a shadow of what
is to come but the substance

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:47.380
belongs to Christ.
 

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.295
Do not let anyone disqualify
you, insisting on self abasement

00:25:50.295 --> 00:25:52.554
and worship of angels,
dwelling on visions,

00:25:52.554 --> 00:25:55.529
puffed up without cause by a
human way of thinking and not

00:25:55.529 --> 00:25:58.348
holding fast to the head from
whom the whole body,

00:25:58.348 --> 00:26:00.950
nourished and held together by
its ligaments and sinews,

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.240
grows with a growth that is
from God.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:06.042
If with Christ you died to the
elemental spirits of the

00:26:06.042 --> 00:26:09.365
universe [remember those are the
stoicheia we talked about

00:26:09.365 --> 00:26:12.028
in Galatians,
the elemental spirits of the

00:26:12.028 --> 00:26:12.769
universe],
 

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.430
why do you live as if you still
belong to the world?

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.828
Why do you submit to
regulations?

00:26:30.828 --> 00:26:33.720
"Do not handle,
do not taste,

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.089
do not touch,"
all these regulations refer to

00:26:36.089 --> 00:26:39.108
things that perish with use,
they are simply human commands

00:26:39.108 --> 00:26:39.868
and teachings.
 

00:26:39.868 --> 00:26:43.325
These have indeed an appearance
of wisdom in promoting

00:26:43.325 --> 00:26:46.586
self-imposed piety,
humility, and severe treatment

00:26:46.586 --> 00:26:49.115
of the body,
but they are of no value in

00:26:49.115 --> 00:26:50.730
checking self-indulgence.
 

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:52.470
What's going on here?
 

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.167
This is basically some form of
asceticism, the control of the

00:26:56.167 --> 00:26:56.598
body.
 

00:26:56.598 --> 00:27:02.720
Asceticism comes from the Greek
word for exercise,

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:08.838
an ascetic is someone who
disciplines the body.

00:27:08.838 --> 00:27:11.852
So "asceticism"
refers to usually the avoidance

00:27:11.852 --> 00:27:14.650
of something like food or
luxurious foods or sex,

00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:17.500
or anything that has desire or
passion as part of it.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.771
So apparently this author is
writing to a community that's

00:27:20.771 --> 00:27:23.986
been bothered by people who are
teaching certain forms of

00:27:23.986 --> 00:27:26.569
self-control and discipline of
the body,

00:27:26.569 --> 00:27:27.890
the worship of angels.
 

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:30.503
Now there's a debate about
whether this refers to people

00:27:30.503 --> 00:27:33.261
worshipping angels or whether it
refers to people who think

00:27:33.261 --> 00:27:35.828
they're joining with angels in
the worship of God.

00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:39.042
I think it must refer to people
who believe they're worshipping

00:27:39.042 --> 00:27:42.307
angels because this author does
link that to stoicheia of

00:27:42.307 --> 00:27:43.190
the universe.
 

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.534
I think what the author is
doing is something that Paul

00:27:45.534 --> 00:27:48.074
sort of did too,
which is somehow equate in a

00:27:48.074 --> 00:27:51.807
sense the stoicheia of
the universe with angels who try

00:27:51.807 --> 00:27:54.868
to manipulate things on the
earth and below us.

00:27:54.868 --> 00:27:57.505
I think that what this author
is probably referring is that

00:27:57.505 --> 00:28:00.460
somebody has come along and is
teaching some churches of Paul,

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:03.396
Paul's churches,
to do some elaborate sort of

00:28:03.396 --> 00:28:07.670
ascetic practices to gain some
kind of great spiritual status.

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.221
Maybe these people are
teaching, you live on the earth

00:28:10.221 --> 00:28:13.161
now but if you want to fly up
through the different regions of

00:28:13.161 --> 00:28:15.144
the heavens--
remember there are several

00:28:15.144 --> 00:28:17.430
different layers of heavens in
ancient cosmology--

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.866
if you want to fly up through
the different layers of heavens

00:28:19.866 --> 00:28:21.368
then you have to stop eating
meat,

00:28:21.368 --> 00:28:24.374
you have to stop having sex,
you need to join in this

00:28:24.374 --> 00:28:25.644
worship of the angels.
 

00:28:25.644 --> 00:28:26.048
Why?
 

00:28:26.048 --> 00:28:29.041
Because angels control the
gateways to all these different

00:28:29.041 --> 00:28:30.038
layers of heaven.
 

00:28:30.038 --> 00:28:33.615
What's going on is some aspect
of asceticism is being taught to

00:28:33.615 --> 00:28:36.960
these people and some of them
seem to be giving into it.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.170
What is the answer this author
gives?

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.950
1:19:
For in Him, that is in Christ

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.211
[Colossians 1:19]
all the fullness of God was

00:28:46.211 --> 00:28:49.509
pleased to dwell,
and through him God was pleased

00:28:49.509 --> 00:28:52.652
to reconcile to himself all
things whether on earth or in

00:28:52.652 --> 00:28:55.021
heaven,
by making peace through the

00:28:55.021 --> 00:28:56.319
blood of his cross.
 

00:28:56.319 --> 00:28:58.920
Look at 3:1-4.
 

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.700
In other words,
what the author says is,

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.874
you don't need all these
ascetic practices because if you

00:29:04.874 --> 00:29:08.750
are in Christ you already
possess everything that the

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:10.690
heavens have to offer.
 

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:13.298
You don't need these extra
practices.

00:29:13.298 --> 00:29:17.357
So he says in Chapter 3:1,
"If you have been raised

00:29:17.357 --> 00:29:20.308
with Christ,"
that's interesting.

00:29:20.308 --> 00:29:24.306
He's basically attributing the
resurrection already to these

00:29:24.306 --> 00:29:26.000
people's current state.
 

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.298
Now maybe he's talking about
baptism.

00:29:28.298 --> 00:29:30.692
Maybe the idea is that in your
baptism when you go down into

00:29:30.692 --> 00:29:32.292
the water;
remember in ancient baptism

00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:34.355
they all dunked them like good
Baptists these days,

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:35.839
not a little sprinkling of
stuff;

00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:37.480
they dunked them in the water.
 

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.971
If you go down in the water
like you're being buried,

00:29:39.971 --> 00:29:42.702
you come up out of the water,
and that's like you're being

00:29:42.702 --> 00:29:43.950
raised from the grave.
 

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.268
He may be talking about if
you've been baptized you have

00:29:47.268 --> 00:29:49.318
been raised with Christ already.
 

00:29:49.318 --> 00:29:52.805
If you've been raised with
Christ, seek the things that are

00:29:52.805 --> 00:29:55.749
above where Christ is,
seated at the right hand of

00:29:55.749 --> 00:29:56.230
God.
 

00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:58.118
Set your minds on things that
are above,

00:29:58.118 --> 00:30:01.019
not on things that are on
earth, for you have died,

00:30:01.019 --> 00:30:04.013
[he's talking about these
people as if they've already

00:30:04.013 --> 00:30:06.613
experienced death]
and your life is hidden with

00:30:06.613 --> 00:30:07.630
Christ in God.
 

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:10.941
When Christ who is your life is
revealed, then you also will be

00:30:10.941 --> 00:30:12.490
revealed with him in glory.
 

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:15.105
This author basically is
saying, you don't need these

00:30:15.105 --> 00:30:17.269
different practices because you
already,

00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:21.046
perhaps in your baptism,
have experienced death and

00:30:21.046 --> 00:30:22.180
resurrection.
 

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.420
The only thing these people
haven't experienced,

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.108
that they will experience in
heaven,

00:30:26.108 --> 00:30:28.417
according to this author,
is simply the revelation of

00:30:28.417 --> 00:30:29.038
their glory.
 

00:30:29.038 --> 00:30:32.090
They're still leather workers,
and waitresses,

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:35.819
and working in the quarry,
so they don't look like kings

00:30:35.819 --> 00:30:36.769
right now.
 

00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:38.230
Their skin doesn't glow.
 

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:41.805
When Christ is revealed then
their skin will glow and all

00:30:41.805 --> 00:30:44.643
their neighbors will go,
oh my God I thought you were

00:30:44.643 --> 00:30:47.114
just a waiter,
now I see that you're living in

00:30:47.114 --> 00:30:48.118
glory in heaven.
 

00:30:48.118 --> 00:30:50.632
That's the only thing they
have, now all that you would

00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:52.492
possess in the heavens,
this author says,

00:30:52.492 --> 00:30:53.608
you already possess.
 

00:30:53.608 --> 00:30:57.593
Now compare this with Paul,
keep your finger in Colossians

00:30:57.593 --> 00:30:59.410
and go back to Romans 6.
 

00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:12.548
"What then are we to
say?"

00:31:12.548 --> 00:31:15.421
Now remember in Romans Paul is
defending himself against

00:31:15.421 --> 00:31:17.666
charges that he has been
antinomian--no law,

00:31:17.666 --> 00:31:20.329
just anything goes,
do anything you want to do.

00:31:20.329 --> 00:31:21.778
What are we to say?
 

00:31:21.778 --> 00:31:24.440
Should we continue in sin in
order that grace may abound?

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.930
By no means!
 

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:28.950
How can we who died to sin go
on living in it?

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.859
Do you not know that all of us
who have been baptized into

00:31:32.859 --> 00:31:35.880
Christ Jesus were baptized into
his death?

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:40.348
Paul's Christians have also
been baptized into death.

00:31:40.348 --> 00:31:45.434
"Therefore we have been
buried with him by baptism into

00:31:45.434 --> 00:31:50.520
death so that just as Christ was
raised from the dead by the

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:54.917
glory of the Father so we also
have been raised from

00:31:54.917 --> 00:31:56.470
death."
 

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:59.558
You all are like sheep,
no that's not what it says!

00:31:59.558 --> 00:32:01.941
I'm lying to you,
that's why I want you to read

00:32:01.941 --> 00:32:02.769
along with me.
 

00:32:02.769 --> 00:32:05.855
That's the way most modern
Christians read that passage

00:32:05.855 --> 00:32:06.368
though.
 

00:32:06.368 --> 00:32:10.170
They take the Colossians
account that has--

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.057
the author kind of acts like
they've been not only buried in

00:32:13.057 --> 00:32:14.868
baptism but also risen in
baptism,

00:32:14.868 --> 00:32:18.269
and they take that Colossians
and read it back into Romans 6.

00:32:18.269 --> 00:32:21.768
That's not what Paul says in
Romans 6, he doesn't say they

00:32:21.768 --> 00:32:23.180
have been raised yet.
 

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.038
Christians have been buried,
but then he says,

00:32:26.038 --> 00:32:30.125
"So we too might walk in
newness of life,"

00:32:30.125 --> 00:32:33.900
that's not happened yet,
according to Paul.

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.605
"If we had been united
with him in a death like his we

00:32:36.605 --> 00:32:39.266
will certainly be reunited with
him in a resurrection like

00:32:39.266 --> 00:32:39.920
his."
 

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.338
For Paul the resurrection of
Christians hasn't happened yet.

00:32:43.338 --> 00:32:46.999
Christians for Paul are living
in this in between state,

00:32:46.999 --> 00:32:50.392
having been baptized into
death, but not having been

00:32:50.392 --> 00:32:51.390
raised yet.
 

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.423
We know that our old self was
crucified with him so that the

00:32:54.423 --> 00:32:57.250
body of sin might be destroyed
and we might no longer be

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.279
enslaved to him.
 

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:00.190
For whoever has died is freed
from sin.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:04.362
There are some of these things
like that but basically for Paul

00:33:04.362 --> 00:33:08.670
in baptism you participate in
the death and burial of Christ,

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:11.170
but you don't yet participate
in the resurrection.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:13.272
Notice that's quite different
from what you found in

00:33:13.272 --> 00:33:13.808
Colossians.
 

00:33:13.808 --> 00:33:15.945
Colossians pulls the
resurrection,

00:33:15.945 --> 00:33:19.702
that for Paul is still in the
future, and he puts it in the

00:33:19.702 --> 00:33:20.480
present.
 

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.006
This is called by scholars
"realized

00:33:24.006 --> 00:33:25.769
eschatology."
 

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:34.359
What's eschatology?
 

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:36.680
Somebody say it.
 

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:37.190
Student:  The end of the
world.

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.516
Prof: Sorry,
the end of the world,

00:33:39.516 --> 00:33:41.318
doctrine about the end of the
world,

00:33:41.318 --> 00:33:43.715
doctrine about the last things,
eschaton is the Greek

00:33:43.715 --> 00:33:45.828
word for "the end"
or "the last,"

00:33:45.828 --> 00:33:48.470
so eschatology is what do you
believe about the last things,

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.529
how things are going to end up.
 

00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:52.221
"Realized
eschatology"

00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:54.294
basically is the term we
scholars give,

00:33:54.294 --> 00:33:57.348
this is not Paul's term or any
other ancient writer.

00:33:57.348 --> 00:34:00.590
The idea that the
eschatological expectations that

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:04.230
Paul expected to happen at the
end of this world is--

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:07.038
has already been realized in
the lives of the church.

00:34:07.038 --> 00:34:10.902
What Paul has is not realized
eschatology because the

00:34:10.902 --> 00:34:15.061
resurrection and all the
benefits that you get from being

00:34:15.061 --> 00:34:18.329
saved by Christ are still in the
future.

00:34:18.329 --> 00:34:23.070
Let's just call that
"reserved

00:34:23.070 --> 00:34:25.860
eschatology."
 

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:28.913
So whereas in Paul's letters
it's very important for Paul's

00:34:28.913 --> 00:34:31.070
theology that the end hasn't
happened yet,

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:33.230
the resurrection hasn't
happened yet.

00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.548
The resurrection of
Christ has happened,

00:34:35.548 --> 00:34:38.423
but remember Paul says he's
just the first fruits of those

00:34:38.423 --> 00:34:39.130
who sleep.
 

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.699
He's the first apple on the
tree.

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:45.423
That's Christ's resurrection,
but all the rest of us are just

00:34:45.423 --> 00:34:48.590
little apple blossoms,
or little immature apples.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:50.349
We haven't gotten to maturity
yet.

00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:52.900
We have to wait until either
Jesus comes back in the

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.849
parousia or we die and
are resurrected at the end.

00:34:55.849 --> 00:34:59.583
Colossians has a realized
eschatology and Paul has a

00:34:59.583 --> 00:35:02.875
reserved eschatology,
and this is one of the major

00:35:02.875 --> 00:35:06.166
theological differences between
Paul's undisputed letters and

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:08.690
Colossians,
that some of us scholars grasp

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:10.389
onto to say it's not Pauline.
 

00:35:10.389 --> 00:35:12.989
Now other people would say,
no, no, no Paul just was

00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:16.047
emphasizing different things
when he wrote Colossians because

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:17.679
the situation was different.
 

00:35:17.679 --> 00:35:20.005
He changed his writing style a
bit because he was writing to a

00:35:20.005 --> 00:35:21.684
different group,
and he wanted to have a more

00:35:21.684 --> 00:35:22.409
elevated style.
 

00:35:22.409 --> 00:35:25.376
He changed his eschatology a
bit and emphasized current

00:35:25.376 --> 00:35:28.070
enjoyment of these things
because of the different

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:28.840
situation.
 

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.387
That's one way to read this,
so some people say either

00:35:31.387 --> 00:35:33.936
Paul's views changed or Paul
just emphasized different

00:35:33.936 --> 00:35:36.706
aspects of theology--
if you want to say Paul wrote

00:35:36.706 --> 00:35:39.039
Colossians,
and there are many scholars who

00:35:39.039 --> 00:35:39.250
do.
 

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:42.938
I say, no this is good evidence
that we're talking about a

00:35:42.938 --> 00:35:46.693
different author who has a
slightly different theology that

00:35:46.693 --> 00:35:48.121
would be,
in some ways,

00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:49.409
pretty fundamentally different.
 

00:35:49.409 --> 00:35:53.746
Like Paul was doing,
though, notice how these people

00:35:53.746 --> 00:35:57.829
are doing what Paul's people in
Galatians did.

00:35:57.829 --> 00:36:01.034
They're looking for something
else to add onto the

00:36:01.034 --> 00:36:04.565
requirements of faith that will
somehow guarantee their

00:36:04.565 --> 00:36:07.510
possession of the blessings of
salvation.

00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:10.300
This author though provides a
different answer.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.340
Paul's answer,
what was Paul's answer to

00:36:12.340 --> 00:36:15.273
people in Galatians who wanted
to add on circumcision and

00:36:15.273 --> 00:36:15.849
kosher?
 

00:36:15.849 --> 00:36:18.755
He basically said no,
you're actually nullifying the

00:36:18.755 --> 00:36:20.010
faithfulness of God.
 

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:24.246
Justification for Paul in
Romans has always been by faith,

00:36:24.246 --> 00:36:28.559
even Abraham was justified by
faith not by circumcision.

00:36:28.559 --> 00:36:31.210
And so Paul makes a big
argument by saying,

00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:35.061
justification has always been
by faith, therefore nothing else

00:36:35.061 --> 00:36:36.639
can be added onto it.
 

00:36:36.639 --> 00:36:39.679
This is important for Paul
because that's God's

00:36:39.679 --> 00:36:40.670
faithfulness.
 

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:42.119
For Paul the most important
thing is,

00:36:42.119 --> 00:36:45.902
if God wasn't always justifying
people by faith that would mean

00:36:45.902 --> 00:36:49.565
God changed his mind and God was
not faithful to the original

00:36:49.565 --> 00:36:51.030
covenant to Abraham.
 

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:54.606
For Paul, God justifies by
faith, he always has justified

00:36:54.606 --> 00:36:57.480
by faith, even all the way back
to Abraham.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.469
The Colossians writer does it a
bit differently.

00:37:00.469 --> 00:37:03.570
He also talks about faith,
that's important to him,

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.150
but basically he says,
you don't need all these

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.730
additions because you already
possess them,

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.400
you've already experienced the
resurrection of Jesus,

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.409
you already sit in the heavenly
places,

00:37:13.409 --> 00:37:14.949
and therefore you don't need
these other things.

00:37:14.949 --> 00:37:20.288
Now Ephesians uses Colossians
as a model and then just builds

00:37:20.288 --> 00:37:21.889
on it even more.
 

00:37:21.889 --> 00:37:27.110
Let's look over to Ephesians
and look at Ephesians 1:20:

00:37:31.099 --> 00:37:35.038
God put this power to work in
Christ when he raised him from

00:37:35.038 --> 00:37:38.775
the dead and seated him at his
right hand in the heavenly

00:37:38.775 --> 00:37:41.780
places far above all rule and
authority,

00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.503
and power, and dominion,
and above every name that is

00:37:44.503 --> 00:37:47.489
named not only in this age but
also in the age to come.

00:37:47.489 --> 00:37:50.590
He has put all things under his
feet and made him the head over

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.387
all things for the church,
which is his body,

00:37:53.387 --> 00:37:56.530
the fullness of him who fills
all in all.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:59.469
Christ is already now seated in
the heavenly places,

00:37:59.469 --> 00:38:03.139
which he is for Paul theology
too, but what makes it different

00:38:03.139 --> 00:38:04.239
is--
look at 2:6,

00:38:04.239 --> 00:38:07.072
chapter 2, verse 6,
"And raised us up with

00:38:07.072 --> 00:38:10.215
him" So again the
resurrection is something the

00:38:10.215 --> 00:38:13.789
Ephesians writer says they've
already experienced....

00:38:13.789 --> 00:38:17.280
and seated us with him in the
heavenly places in Christ Jesus

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.594
so that in the ages to come he
might show the immeasurable

00:38:20.594 --> 00:38:22.739
richness--
riches of his grace and

00:38:22.739 --> 00:38:24.820
kindness toward us in Christ
Jesus.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:30.130
Already--notice verse 8 of
chapter 2,

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.458
"For by grace you have
been saved through faith and

00:38:33.458 --> 00:38:36.909
this is not your own doing it is
the gift of God."

00:38:36.909 --> 00:38:38.699
Now that's something that you
might not notice,

00:38:38.699 --> 00:38:40.889
but scholars like to pick on
little things like that,

00:38:40.889 --> 00:38:43.708
and most scholars will point
out that if you look at just

00:38:43.708 --> 00:38:47.650
Paul's seven undisputed letters,
salvation is something that for

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.550
Paul exists in the future.
 

00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:53.360
Justification is something that
you've experienced in the past.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.447
So Paul can say you have been
justified, but Paul almost never

00:38:58.447 --> 00:39:01.699
acts like Christians have been
saved.

00:39:01.699 --> 00:39:03.478
For example,
when someone knocks on your

00:39:03.478 --> 00:39:05.349
door and someone says,
"Have you been

00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:06.079
saved?"
 

00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:09.643
You can say,
well, no, because the Apostle

00:39:09.643 --> 00:39:13.380
Paul reserves salvation for the
end time.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:16.539
I've been justified but I
haven't been saved.

00:39:16.539 --> 00:39:19.369
That's good Pauline theology.
 

00:39:19.369 --> 00:39:21.768
The people who talk about
"have you been saved?"

00:39:21.768 --> 00:39:24.007
they're using theology from
Ephesians perhaps,

00:39:24.007 --> 00:39:26.195
or from Colossians,
but it doesn't really fit

00:39:26.195 --> 00:39:27.190
Paul's theology.
 

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:29.360
For Paul's theology,
justification is something

00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:31.672
you've experienced,
but salvation is something you

00:39:31.672 --> 00:39:32.900
still have to wait on.
 

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:35.289
For Ephesians,
though, salvation is something

00:39:35.289 --> 00:39:37.300
you have experienced through
faith.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.804
Notice that Ephesians therefore
actually looks like it's using

00:39:40.804 --> 00:39:43.650
Colossians in the example,
it has some of the same themes,

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:46.356
some of the same styles,
but Ephesians actually looks

00:39:46.356 --> 00:39:49.670
even more like a treatise and
not like a real letter.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.597
If you outline Ephesians,
you get the first three

00:39:52.597 --> 00:39:55.101
chapters,
which are very elaborate

00:39:55.101 --> 00:39:59.309
doctrinal teachings about what
Christ has accomplished,

00:39:59.309 --> 00:40:01.389
what you, if you're a follower
of Christ,

00:40:01.389 --> 00:40:02.320
have experienced.
 

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.668
And one of the main focuses of
Ephesians is that Gentiles and

00:40:05.668 --> 00:40:08.628
Jews, the whole world,
has been joined at one humanity

00:40:08.628 --> 00:40:10.079
in the body of Christ.
 

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:14.239
The dividing wall of hostility
between Jews and Gentiles,

00:40:14.239 --> 00:40:16.969
probably the law in this guy's
thinking,

00:40:16.969 --> 00:40:20.126
has been broken down and all
followers of Christ have

00:40:20.126 --> 00:40:21.280
experienced this.
 

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.840
The first three chapters do
that, and then chapters 4-6 in

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.840
Ephesians look more like a
section on ethics,

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:30.780
or as scholars will often say,
paraenesis.

00:40:34.719 --> 00:40:38.860
This is just a fancy,
anglicization of a Greek word,

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.318
which means
"instruction"

00:40:40.318 --> 00:40:41.820
or "moral
instruction."

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:43.570
It's like when your mom says do
this,

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:45.570
don't do that,
behave yourself,

00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.039
don't pick your nose at the
table,

00:40:48.039 --> 00:40:52.418
say excuse me when you burp,
so there's a lot of Christian

00:40:52.418 --> 00:40:55.260
material that are sort of do
this,

00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.972
don't do that ethics and that's
what the last half of Ephesians

00:40:58.972 --> 00:41:00.050
looks more like.
 

00:41:00.050 --> 00:41:03.469
So scholars will often say
Ephesians looks like a very nice

00:41:03.469 --> 00:41:07.007
treatise, a very well organized
outline of Christian doctrine

00:41:07.007 --> 00:41:09.556
and teaching;
the first half of it being

00:41:09.556 --> 00:41:12.469
doctrine and the second half of
it being ethics.

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:17.289
Why do I say that Ephesians was
written by a different author

00:41:17.289 --> 00:41:19.940
and not simply the same author?
 

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:23.692
There's really just one reason
and this was argued by a young

00:41:23.692 --> 00:41:24.960
man,
Jeremy Hultin,

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:28.222
who teaches in The Divinity
School here and he did a PhD

00:41:28.222 --> 00:41:30.239
here at Yale several years ago.
 

00:41:30.239 --> 00:41:34.929
The PhD was mainly on foul
language in early Christianity.

00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:36.900
What counts as cussing?
 

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.050
What counts as dirty language?
 

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.994
Why both Ephesians and
Colossians talk about don't

00:41:42.994 --> 00:41:46.619
use--the term in Greek is
aischrologia,

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:48.230
shameful speech.
 

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.480
Well Jeremy kind of sat there
and he thought,

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.715
well--back when I was a kid my
mom wouldn't let us say

00:41:53.715 --> 00:41:56.280
"darn,"
we were really strict.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.130
You certainly couldn't say
"dang,"

00:41:58.130 --> 00:41:59.679
that was worse than
"darn,"

00:41:59.679 --> 00:42:01.960
and "damn"
was worse than any of them,

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.190
so don't get caught saying
"damn."

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:07.577
Now I've actually caught my
mother saying it a few times

00:42:07.577 --> 00:42:09.239
lately but things change.
 

00:42:09.239 --> 00:42:13.617
What makes "damn"
bad for some people and

00:42:13.617 --> 00:42:15.719
"darn"
okay?

00:42:15.719 --> 00:42:18.219
Well these are cultural
differences, right?

00:42:18.219 --> 00:42:20.420
Why is it that in some cultures
body parts,

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.458
certain body parts,
or excrement is considered a

00:42:22.458 --> 00:42:24.628
foul word that you're not
supposed to say in polite

00:42:24.628 --> 00:42:25.150
company?
 

00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:28.637
Why is it that some cultures
have curse words and some of

00:42:28.637 --> 00:42:31.690
those curse words are related to
sacred things?

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:34.713
Like why in some cultures is it
considered bad language and

00:42:34.713 --> 00:42:37.320
offensive language to say
"Jesus Christ,"

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.239
especially if you say
"Jesus H. Christ"?

00:42:40.239 --> 00:42:42.947
Whereas, as in other cultures,
calling on the name of a god or

00:42:42.947 --> 00:42:45.610
a goddess wouldn't be considered
shameful language at all.

00:42:45.610 --> 00:42:47.739
So Jeremy said,
what do these people mean by

00:42:47.739 --> 00:42:48.730
shameful language?
 

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.369
How do you know shameful
language when you see it in the

00:42:50.369 --> 00:42:51.829
ancient world and what were they
talking about?

00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:54.998
His dissertation is on that,
but one thing he points out is

00:42:54.998 --> 00:42:58.329
that although both the writer of
Colossians and Ephesians tell

00:42:58.329 --> 00:43:00.570
people not to use shameful
language,

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.351
the writer of Colossians
actually tells people in his

00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:05.010
church to use witty language.
 

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:07.266
He says, and your translation
may something like this,

00:43:07.266 --> 00:43:09.480
"Let your speech be
seasoned with salt."

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.510
And Jeremy pointed out that
this is a reference to witty

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:15.929
language, to a language of wit.
 

00:43:15.929 --> 00:43:21.070
The writer to Ephesians
condemns that kind of language.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:24.579
He just noticed that these two
writers are very similar in some

00:43:24.579 --> 00:43:28.260
ways but when it comes down to
what counts as shameful speech,

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:32.110
the writer of the Ephesians
considered shameful speech even

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:34.664
to include witticisms,
making jokes,

00:43:34.664 --> 00:43:37.559
that also was considered
shameful speech.

00:43:37.559 --> 00:43:40.559
Whereas the writer of
Colossians doesn't include that.

00:43:40.559 --> 00:43:43.920
In fact, he tells people to use
wit in their language.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:47.150
So that's just one of the
reasons.

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:50.219
Before that I kind of thought,
well, probably the same person

00:43:50.219 --> 00:43:53.083
wrote both these letters,
and they were just different in

00:43:53.083 --> 00:43:53.800
some ways.
 

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.942
But he convinced me that quite
probably they were written by

00:43:55.942 --> 00:43:57.130
two different,
very similar,

00:43:57.130 --> 00:43:58.840
but two different followers of
Jesus,

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:02.702
with Colossians being the
earlier letter and the Ephesians

00:44:02.702 --> 00:44:06.635
writer using Colossians as a
model and then capitalizing on

00:44:06.635 --> 00:44:07.110
it.
 

00:44:07.110 --> 00:44:10.166
Another interesting thing is we
don't really know whether the

00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:12.969
letter to the Ephesians was
written to the Ephesians.

00:44:12.969 --> 00:44:16.119
There's an interesting problem
in the Greek manuscripts.

00:44:16.119 --> 00:44:18.715
A lot of the Greek manuscripts
don't have "to the

00:44:18.715 --> 00:44:21.016
Ephesians,"
some of them have another place

00:44:21.016 --> 00:44:23.039
name there,
and some of them seem to have

00:44:23.039 --> 00:44:23.639
just a blank.
 

00:44:23.639 --> 00:44:28.041
This has led some scholars to
say maybe Ephesians was written

00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:29.730
as a circular letter.
 

00:44:29.730 --> 00:44:31.329
In fact some people have even
said,

00:44:31.329 --> 00:44:34.454
maybe Ephesians was written
when a collection of Paul's

00:44:34.454 --> 00:44:37.579
letters was made and some scribe
or editor decided,

00:44:37.579 --> 00:44:40.409
well I'm going to write an
introductory letter that will

00:44:40.409 --> 00:44:42.829
encapsulate Paul's Gospel in
Paul's message,

00:44:42.829 --> 00:44:45.079
and I'm going to do it in a
very elevated style,

00:44:45.079 --> 00:44:47.909
and we'll put that at the
beginning of the collection to

00:44:47.909 --> 00:44:50.891
sort of be an introductory
letter for all the collection of

00:44:50.891 --> 00:44:51.869
Paul's letters.
 

00:44:51.869 --> 00:44:54.396
One of the things is that we
think that Ephesians may have

00:44:54.396 --> 00:44:57.012
been a circular letter because
of this idea that not all the

00:44:57.012 --> 00:44:59.849
Greek manuscripts have Ephesians
and some have other things.

00:44:59.849 --> 00:45:02.563
The idea is that the guy may
have written a letter with the

00:45:02.563 --> 00:45:04.856
idea that you would leave
"to the blank"

00:45:04.856 --> 00:45:07.289
and then fill it in with
different place names,

00:45:07.289 --> 00:45:08.840
according to where you were
going to send the letter,

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.277
or that you would send it one
place and then they could fill

00:45:11.277 --> 00:45:13.179
in another name and send it to
other places.

00:45:13.179 --> 00:45:16.300
Ephesians, by many of our
reckoning,

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.360
may have been written as a
circular letter,

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:21.119
intended to be circulated
around different churches,

00:45:21.119 --> 00:45:23.875
maybe even as sort of an
introductory letter to a

00:45:23.875 --> 00:45:26.000
collection of Paul's other
letters.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.271
What, though,
are the other developments,

00:45:28.271 --> 00:45:30.829
and we'll close in just a few
minutes here.

00:45:30.829 --> 00:45:33.543
What makes these letters
different from Pauline

00:45:33.543 --> 00:45:34.429
Christianity?
 

00:45:34.429 --> 00:45:35.409
There are a few things.
 

00:45:35.409 --> 00:45:39.663
Number one, I said Colossians
and Ephesians both have realized

00:45:39.663 --> 00:45:42.849
eschatology;
Paul has reserved eschatology.

00:45:42.849 --> 00:45:45.045
In other words,
for Paul all the enjoyments

00:45:45.045 --> 00:45:48.130
that Christians would experience
are still in the future.

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:51.068
It's like for Paul the
blessings of the

00:45:51.068 --> 00:45:53.543
eschaton,
the eschatology,

00:45:53.543 --> 00:45:55.400
is still horizontal.
 

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:58.856
We're here, we're going there,
we're on earth,

00:45:58.856 --> 00:46:00.469
we'll be in heaven.
 

00:46:00.469 --> 00:46:02.744
We have experienced death,
we will experience

00:46:02.744 --> 00:46:03.518
resurrection.
 

00:46:03.518 --> 00:46:08.367
For Ephesians and Colossians,
they've taken this axis and

00:46:08.367 --> 00:46:11.291
turned it like this,
so that the things

00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:14.346
that--there's the cosmos and
there's the heavenlies but they

00:46:14.346 --> 00:46:17.237
all still exist right now,
so the rest of the world is

00:46:17.237 --> 00:46:19.967
down here on earth,
but followers of Jesus have

00:46:19.967 --> 00:46:23.780
been translated already right
now into the heavenly places,

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.159
and they already enjoy these
benefits.

00:46:25.159 --> 00:46:27.840
It's almost as if the
eschatological timeline,

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.668
the axis in Paul's letter,
has been just flipped up like

00:46:30.668 --> 00:46:32.519
this in Colossians and
Ephesians,

00:46:32.519 --> 00:46:34.119
so that's one major difference.
 

00:46:34.119 --> 00:46:37.289
Another major difference is
Colossians and Ephesians have a

00:46:37.289 --> 00:46:38.929
slightly higher Christology.
 

00:46:38.929 --> 00:46:41.742
The Colossians writer,
very famously,

00:46:41.742 --> 00:46:46.117
says, in Christ the entire
fullness of God was pleased to

00:46:46.117 --> 00:46:46.900
dwell.
 

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:49.989
Paul never says anything quite
like that.

00:46:49.989 --> 00:46:54.146
In fact, Paul's letters are
kind of problematic from a good

00:46:54.146 --> 00:46:58.088
orthodox theological point of
view because Paul seems to

00:46:58.088 --> 00:47:02.889
assume what we would later call
a subordinationist Christology.

00:47:02.889 --> 00:47:05.920
Subordinationist Christology,
which was declared heretical by

00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:08.750
the time you get to the creeds
in the fourth century,

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:12.896
says that Jesus is another
person, separate from God the

00:47:12.896 --> 00:47:15.739
Father,
and Jesus is inferior to God

00:47:15.739 --> 00:47:18.630
the Father,
so Jesus is subordinate to God

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:19.400
the Father.
 

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.429
There are several passages in
Paul's letters,

00:47:21.429 --> 00:47:24.222
one of them in 1 Corinthians 15
that we've talked about and read

00:47:24.222 --> 00:47:26.702
in this class already,
where Paul seems to still

00:47:26.702 --> 00:47:28.789
believe that God the Father is
here,

00:47:28.789 --> 00:47:29.730
Christ is here.
 

00:47:29.730 --> 00:47:32.309
Then there was 1 Corinthians 11
where Paul talks about,

00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:35.496
"Man is the head of woman,
Christ is the head of man,

00:47:35.496 --> 00:47:37.909
and God is the head of
Christ."

00:47:37.909 --> 00:47:39.659
Well that's a hierarchy.
 

00:47:39.659 --> 00:47:41.909
God, Christ, man, woman.
 

00:47:41.909 --> 00:47:45.226
So Paul seems to hold what we
would call almost a

00:47:45.226 --> 00:47:47.989
subordinationist form of
Christology,

00:47:47.989 --> 00:47:51.960
whereas Colossians and
Ephesians tend to have Christ as

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.210
more fully God.
 

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:55.751
Another of the changes,
and I won't go into this too

00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:57.052
much,
but if you look at the

00:47:57.052 --> 00:47:59.442
household codes,
and we'll get to this later

00:47:59.442 --> 00:48:02.320
when we talk about Christianity
in the family.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.590
In Colossians 3:18-4:1 and
Ephesians 5:21-6:9,

00:48:06.590 --> 00:48:11.623
you have an elaborate set of
rules for the head of the

00:48:11.623 --> 00:48:14.755
household, the wife,
the children,

00:48:14.755 --> 00:48:16.369
the slaves.
 

00:48:16.369 --> 00:48:18.860
Everybody has their job to do.
 

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.228
In Colossians and Ephesians
there is clearly a patriarchal

00:48:22.228 --> 00:48:24.710
household structure that's
hierarchical.

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:27.539
The wife and the children
submit to the husband,

00:48:27.539 --> 00:48:30.309
the father, the slaves submit
to the master.

00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:33.847
This is much more hierarchical
and pro-household than what you

00:48:33.847 --> 00:48:35.820
get in Paul's authentic letters.
 

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.643
Paul is perfectly willing to
kind of have women and men,

00:48:38.643 --> 00:48:40.340
husbands and wives more mutual.
 

00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:43.335
He says in 1 Corinthians 7,
"The husband controls the

00:48:43.335 --> 00:48:46.489
wife's body but the wife also
controls the husband's body.

00:48:46.489 --> 00:48:49.289
They each have authority over
each other's body."

00:48:49.289 --> 00:48:52.108
That's not the way it is in
Colossians and Ephesians where

00:48:52.108 --> 00:48:54.730
it's much more hierarchical,
much more patriarchal.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:57.494
There are some kinds of
differences, but what does it

00:48:57.494 --> 00:48:58.400
say about Paul?
 

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.742
Already by these letters,
then, by these pseudonymous

00:49:01.742 --> 00:49:04.313
letters,
we have Paul being thought of

00:49:04.313 --> 00:49:07.782
now as a figure in the past
whose reputation can now be

00:49:07.782 --> 00:49:11.251
built on to advance a slightly
different version of the

00:49:11.251 --> 00:49:15.106
Christian Gospel and Christian
message than you got in Paul's

00:49:15.106 --> 00:49:16.070
letters.
 

00:49:16.070 --> 00:49:19.960
Paul is already starting to
recede into the past now,

00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:22.989
and, as we'll see as the
semester goes on,

00:49:22.989 --> 00:49:26.637
we'll read other texts that
have Paul even further in the

00:49:26.637 --> 00:49:29.170
past,
and then he can be drawn on to

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:32.860
justify or promote another form
of early Christianity.

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.260
Any questions about that?
 

00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:39.969
Next time what we'll do is
we'll look at the letter of

00:49:39.969 --> 00:49:43.889
James in which we have someone
who may indeed be actually

00:49:43.889 --> 00:49:47.880
opposing Paul's Gospel and
Paul's message rather than just

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:49.349
building on it.
 

00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:50.909
See you next time.

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.799
So last time we found out how
to evaluate options,

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.682
especially stopping options
where you don't have so many

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:10.530
options.
 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.260
You either do something or you
don't do it.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.140
That's the simplest kind of
option.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.680
And we discovered through two
examples, at least,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.600
that the option is worth more
than people realize.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.450
So this time we're going to
apply that--

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.274
and that the way to figure out
exactly what it's worth and

00:00:28.274 --> 00:00:30.950
exactly what to do is to work by
backward induction.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.646
So this time we're going to
apply that reasoning to the two

00:00:34.646 --> 00:00:37.260
most important options in the
economy,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.397
one is callable bonds and a
much more important one is the

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:44.020
mortgage option.
 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.824
And all of you at some time in
your lives will probably own

00:00:46.824 --> 00:00:49.532
houses and have a mortgage
option and have to think about

00:00:49.532 --> 00:00:52.240
what kind of mortgage to get and
what the option is.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.170
So I want to teach you how to
think about that problem.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.530
So let's start with the
callable bond problem.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.438
Uh-oh, I forgot to turn this on.
 

00:01:08.438 --> 00:01:11.280
So let's start here with the
callable bond problem.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:25.659
 
 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.447
So callable bonds are issued by
corporations and they pay,

00:01:30.447 --> 00:01:34.060
usually, an interest rate,
say 9 percent.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.066
So the bond pays 9 percent,
9 percent and then some years

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:42.753
later it pays 109,
but at any point in time you

00:01:42.753 --> 00:01:46.660
have the option,
the company has the option of

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.753
calling the bond,
and calling it for--so it's

00:01:50.753 --> 00:01:55.660
going to pay 9 100 at the end,
so here it's 9.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.610
So at any time the company has
the option of calling the bond.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.468
So what does that mean?
 

00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:05.551
It means after it's paid the
9--the company's issued a bond

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:09.772
promising to pay 9 for say 10
years and then the principal in

00:02:09.772 --> 00:02:12.920
the 10th year,
this is year 10,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.960
the total of 109.
 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.360
So that's the simplest possible
bond.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.310
And the company occasionally
has the option,

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.490
we'll see in a minute why it
would want this option,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.060
has the option of saying,
"Okay,

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.250
we don't want to make the rest
of those payments.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.310
We want to get out of our
promise.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.080
We've just paid you 9.
 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.674
We'll pay off the extra 100
that we're eventually going have

00:02:33.674 --> 00:02:36.050
to owe and we'll call it a
day."

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:47.030
So this is the payment and this
is the remaining balance.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.628
So for a callable bond the
remaining balance is always 100.

00:02:52.628 --> 00:02:56.179
So it's pretty obvious that if
you've made an arrangement,

00:02:56.179 --> 00:02:59.853
so I owe you--like for example
the prototypical mortgage was

00:02:59.853 --> 00:03:01.408
exactly of this kind.
 

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:04.008
Somebody borrows money from you
and they say,

00:03:04.008 --> 00:03:07.376
"I promise to pay you 9
dollars a year until the last

00:03:07.376 --> 00:03:09.680
year when I'm going to pay you
109.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.468
This is called,
for those old mortgages it was

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:16.445
called the balloon payment,
but in typical bonds it's just

00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:20.288
the principal payment,
the 100 face value of the bond.

00:03:20.288 --> 00:03:23.562
So the person who borrowed the
money and has agreed to pay off

00:03:23.562 --> 00:03:26.200
over the years,
he might have a reason why the

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.878
house he put up as collateral is
no longer going to be his house.

00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:33.375
He might want to move in which
case the lender doesn't have a

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:36.870
house anymore backing the loan
and they have to have some way

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.199
of resolving the loan and ending
it.

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.167
So the question is,
after you've made a payment,

00:03:41.167 --> 00:03:43.805
how can you resolve the rest of
the loan which is supposed to go

00:03:43.805 --> 00:03:44.810
on for 6 more years?
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.979
Well, you just agree to pay 100
and then you call it quits.

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.550
So that's a typical kind of
bond.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.922
A non-callable bond is,
you've committed to paying the

00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:59.803
9 dollars and the 109 at the end
and you have no option to get

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:01.139
out of the thing.
 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.990
So we want to study what the
difference is in value between

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.841
the non-callable bond where
you're obliged to pay the whole

00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:09.566
thing until the end,
and the callable bond where you

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:11.158
can get out of it by paying 100.
 

00:04:11.158 --> 00:04:14.967
And it's easy to see why a
callable bond might have been

00:04:14.967 --> 00:04:17.925
invented,
especially for a mortgage when

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:21.891
you've got this balloon payment
because you might want to

00:04:21.891 --> 00:04:23.379
dissolve the debt.
 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:26.596
But by putting in this option
to dissolve the debt you

00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:29.449
drastically change the value of
the promise,

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.720
and that's what we want to
calculate,

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.170
how much that changes.
 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.629
So why might it change?
 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:36.190
Well, the interest rates might
change.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.069
They might go up or down.
 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:42.312
Soon we're going to have them
going up or down in a more

00:04:42.312 --> 00:04:46.192
complicated way,
but suppose that the interest

00:04:46.192 --> 00:04:49.690
rate starts somewhere like at 8
percent,

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.529
maybe, and it could go up to
some number.

00:04:53.529 --> 00:05:01.120
Now, I'm always going to do a
geometric random walk.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.879
This has become very
fashionable in finance and you

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:07.245
should be asking the question,
is it special that we only have

00:05:07.245 --> 00:05:08.459
two possibilities?
 

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:10.870
Life has many more than two
possibilities.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.999
Suppose we had hundreds of
possibilities,

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:14.649
would that make a difference?
 

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:16.529
The answer is it's not going to
make a difference,

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:17.949
but we're going to have to see
why.

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.601
So in a geometric random walk
literally the thing can go up or

00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:24.050
down each period.
 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.040
So what does it go to if this
is r_0?

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.444
The next period we say it goes
to r_0 times e to the

00:05:33.444 --> 00:05:39.535
volatility, which I usually call
sigma, plus maybe a drift,

00:05:39.535 --> 00:05:40.690
plus d.
 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.560
And here it's going to go to
r_0e--

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.430
let's write it with a little
more room--

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:59.029
r_0 e to the minus
sigma plus d,

00:05:59.029 --> 00:06:00.639
so what's happened here?
 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.778
The interest rate started at 8
percent.

00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:06.259
It gets multiplied by e to the
d, which is just a number,

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.841
so it's maybe tending to go up
over time if d is positive or if

00:06:10.841 --> 00:06:12.838
d is 0--
think of d = 0--r_0

00:06:12.838 --> 00:06:14.879
on average is going to stay at
r_0,

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:16.329
but there's some uncertainty.
 

00:06:16.329 --> 00:06:17.810
Maybe the interest rate goes up.
 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.696
We multiply it by some number,
e to the sigma,

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:24.673
and then we multiply it by the
reciprocal of the same number or

00:06:24.673 --> 00:06:26.920
we divide it by e to the sigma.
 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.014
So using the exponential
notation just makes the

00:06:30.014 --> 00:06:33.767
computations in the computer
easier because the computer's

00:06:33.767 --> 00:06:35.019
adding numbers.
 

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:41.310
This thing over here is going
to be r_0 e to the 2

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.230
sigma 2d, right?
 

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:48.283
And this will just be
r_0 e to the 2 d,

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:54.600
and this will be r_0
e to the minus 2 sigma 2 d.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.293
So the computer in calculating
the interest rate at every step

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:01.865
is adding exponents and it makes
the calculation when you're

00:07:01.865 --> 00:07:04.410
doing gazillions of nodes much
faster.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:09.420
So that's why it's traditional
to use this notation,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.218
but really all I'm saying is
you multiply or divide by the

00:07:12.218 --> 00:07:14.819
same number to see what the next
interest rate is,

00:07:14.819 --> 00:07:17.163
and on top of that you might be
sort of increasing all the

00:07:17.163 --> 00:07:19.673
things over time just because
you think the interest rates are

00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:20.620
going up over time.
 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.444
So that's how we're modeling
uncertainty, and everybody is

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:28.269
supposed to understand what the
probabilities are of these

00:07:28.269 --> 00:07:28.939
moves.
 

00:07:28.939 --> 00:07:32.418
So for now that's going to be
our model of uncertainty and in

00:07:32.418 --> 00:07:36.014
a few minutes I'm going to try
and indicate why complicating it

00:07:36.014 --> 00:07:37.579
won't have much effect.
 

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:39.250
So are there any questions?
 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.019
This notation I hope isn't too
complicated.

00:07:42.019 --> 00:07:44.276
Are there any questions about
the interest rate process I'm

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:46.259
assuming, the uncertainty that
people are facing?

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:46.910
Yeah?
 

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.142
Student: Why is that
middle probability on the far

00:07:50.142 --> 00:07:52.336
right, r_0 is always
equal to

00:07:52.336 --> 00:07:54.069
&gt;?
 

00:07:54.069 --> 00:07:56.973
Prof: Because I'm
assuming that if there weren't

00:07:56.973 --> 00:07:59.930
uncertainty the interest rate
was going to keep steadily

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.778
rising by multiplying by the
constant e to the d.

00:08:02.778 --> 00:08:04.990
So here I've multiplied it by e
to the d.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:06.992
Here I'm multiplying it again
by e to the d,

00:08:06.992 --> 00:08:09.370
and I'm going to multiply it
again by e to the d.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:13.541
So if d is 1 tenth of a percent
it means that the interest rate

00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:16.839
is rising at 1 tenth of a
percent every period.

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:19.278
You might just think interest
rates are going to get higher in

00:08:19.278 --> 00:08:19.800
the future.
 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.269
You might have a more
complicated function than

00:08:22.269 --> 00:08:24.310
steadily rising or steadily
falling.

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.723
It's just that this is the
simplest to add a little

00:08:26.723 --> 00:08:29.089
complication without making it
too complicated.

00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:33.986
Steadily rising or steadily
falling and binomial uncertainty

00:08:33.986 --> 00:08:37.639
were the easiest simple things I
could do.

00:08:37.639 --> 00:08:40.904
Of course a more realistic
thing would do more complicated

00:08:40.904 --> 00:08:41.418
things.
 

00:08:41.418 --> 00:08:42.820
Any other questions about what
this means?

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.554
I know this can be confusing,
this notation,

00:08:44.554 --> 00:08:46.168
so let's just figure out the
notation.

00:08:46.168 --> 00:08:49.333
Make sure you understand it
before I move on because it's

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:51.029
really nothing but notation.
 

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:53.808
I'm just saying the interest
rate is 8 percent today.

00:08:53.808 --> 00:08:57.331
It can go up a little or down a
little and then after that it

00:08:57.331 --> 00:09:00.381
can go up or down and the
percentage rise and fall is

00:09:00.381 --> 00:09:03.551
always going to be the same
relative to a drift and the

00:09:03.551 --> 00:09:06.928
drift might be 0,
the drift might be positive.

00:09:06.928 --> 00:09:21.580
So to take an example,
let's take an example here.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:22.740
Did I plug everything in?
 

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.860
Yes.
 

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.470
This is a spreadsheet that you
have called callable bond.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:31.340
I did a little work on it,
but not much.

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.820
It's basically your spreadsheet.
 

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.159
Everything is plugged in here.
 

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.519
You're seeing that, right?
 

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:43.452
So what I've done is I've said
let's take over here the year,

00:09:43.452 --> 00:09:47.399
so here are the years,
0,1, 2,3, blah up to 31 or

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:48.548
something.
 

00:09:48.548 --> 00:09:52.945
Then the bond coupon rate is 9
percent, so the bond is going to

00:09:52.945 --> 00:09:54.860
pay 9 dollars,
9 percent.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.970
The face is always 100.
 

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.470
It'll pay 9 dollars until the
end.

00:09:58.470 --> 00:10:02.504
So if I take the bond maturity
of 30 down here I've got the 9

00:10:02.504 --> 00:10:06.269
dollar payments and I've got the
remaining principal,

00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:09.351
the remaining balance,
what you could pay to dissolve

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:10.240
the contract.
 

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.350
You could after the first year,
after paying 9,

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:14.826
immediately afterwards you
could pay 100 and say forget

00:10:14.826 --> 00:10:16.019
about the whole thing.
 

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:19.388
So that's that,
and so it goes all the way to

00:10:19.388 --> 00:10:22.582
year 30,
and year 30 you see you're

00:10:22.582 --> 00:10:26.014
paying 109,
and then the bond is over,

00:10:26.014 --> 00:10:29.049
109 and by then the bond is
over,

00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:31.500
there's nothing to talk about.
 

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.596
So now I start off the interest
rate somewhere at 8 percent,

00:10:35.596 --> 00:10:39.417
and I take the volatility,
it's always said in hundreds,

00:10:39.417 --> 00:10:41.639
I take the volatility of 16.
 

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:45.649
That means sigma = 16 over 100,
because that's the way people

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:48.190
talk about volatility of 16
percent.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.269
So that is a sort of standard
volatility,

00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:54.958
12 or 16 percent is about the
annual volatility of these

00:10:54.958 --> 00:10:58.255
things traditionally,
so I've taken the volatility at

00:10:58.255 --> 00:10:58.908
16 percent.
 

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.798
So I take the drift of 0 to
make that simple.

00:11:01.798 --> 00:11:06.090
The d's disappearing,
so what does that mean?

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:09.846
It means that whatever the
thing was last period when it

00:11:09.846 --> 00:11:12.509
moves to here I take the old
number--

00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:17.850
at the top there if you read
this, this is the up multiplier.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.902
I just take e to the sigma d
and that's what this says over

00:11:22.902 --> 00:11:26.298
here, exponent of--it just says
that.

00:11:26.298 --> 00:11:31.909
So that's the up multiplier and
that's the down multiplier.

00:11:31.909 --> 00:11:33.808
Let's just see how that looks.
 

00:11:33.808 --> 00:11:38.929
So if I look at the interest
rates I start at 8 percent and

00:11:38.929 --> 00:11:43.609
they can go up by that
multiplier, 16 percent up or 16

00:11:43.609 --> 00:11:45.110
percent down.
 

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:48.125
And see if you take 8 percent
you add 16 percent to it,

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:51.197
slightly more than 16 percent,
because e to the .16 is a

00:11:51.197 --> 00:11:53.210
little bit more than 16 percent.
 

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:57.418
You take 8,16 percent up is
about 9.3 percent interest and

00:11:57.418 --> 00:12:01.480
16 percent down you go from 8
percent to 6.8 percent.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.308
And things just go up or down
so that's the uncertainty.

00:12:04.308 --> 00:12:08.048
So that's what interest rates
are going to do.

00:12:08.048 --> 00:12:11.375
So everybody knows that you
start at 8 percent and interest

00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:14.928
rates can go up or down by 16
percent for the next 30 years.

00:12:14.928 --> 00:12:17.860
The question is,
what's the value of the bond?

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:22.067
Well, if you couldn't call
it--please interrupt me if

00:12:22.067 --> 00:12:23.928
you're not following.
 

00:12:23.928 --> 00:12:27.580
If you couldn't call it,
non-callable bond,

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:32.100
why would you expect it to have
such a high price?

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.067
Well, because the interest rate
is, sorry, the interest rate,

00:12:36.067 --> 00:12:40.234
remember, is only 8 percent and
on average it's going to stay at

00:12:40.234 --> 00:12:41.158
8 percent.
 

00:12:41.158 --> 00:12:43.850
It could go up or down,
but it's always coming

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:46.899
back--the middle thing there is
always 8 percent.

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:48.817
So if you look in the middle
it's 8 percent,

00:12:48.817 --> 00:12:50.869
8 percent, 8 percent,
8 percent, so sort of the

00:12:50.869 --> 00:12:52.428
geometric average is 8 percent.
 

00:12:52.428 --> 00:12:54.000
On average it's going to be 8
percent.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.279
That's less than the payment,
9, so the poor bondholder is

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:00.659
overpaying,
paying 9 every year when the

00:13:00.659 --> 00:13:03.606
interest rate is only 8 percent
and on average is going to be 8

00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:04.129
percent.
 

00:13:04.129 --> 00:13:08.168
So obviously the bond issuer is
giving a very good deal to the

00:13:08.168 --> 00:13:12.139
buyer by paying 9 when the
interest rate's only 8 percent.

00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:14.100
And you know how you calculate
this.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:17.058
At every step you'd have to do
it by backward induction.

00:13:17.058 --> 00:13:22.636
So you'd write down,
and we've done this before,

00:13:22.636 --> 00:13:27.028
the value at every node
V_S,

00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:33.200
so if I take a node here what's
the value of it?

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.340
I don't know if I need to do a
concrete example.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:38.038
How do I do this by backward
induction?

00:13:38.038 --> 00:13:42.559
So I keep going like that,
right?

00:13:42.559 --> 00:13:45.178
And then life is going to end.
 

00:13:45.178 --> 00:13:47.668
This is the last payment
somewhere.

00:13:47.668 --> 00:13:54.447
Let's say the last payment is
here so you're going to get 109

00:13:54.447 --> 00:14:00.433
no matter what because that's
the last period 109,109,

00:14:00.433 --> 00:14:01.788
109,109.
 

00:14:01.788 --> 00:14:07.049
So we know what the value is
here at the end because it's 0

00:14:07.049 --> 00:14:11.312
beyond this point,
and we know what the value is

00:14:11.312 --> 00:14:12.129
here.
 

00:14:12.129 --> 00:14:14.753
You're going to pay 109 no
matter what so you just take the

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:15.928
interest rate back here.
 

00:14:15.928 --> 00:14:17.450
So we know what the value is
here.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.315
So the question is if you
figured out the value at the end

00:14:20.315 --> 00:14:22.677
of the tree,
which is trivial because at the

00:14:22.677 --> 00:14:25.220
very end you're just going to
get 109 for sure,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.946
can you figure out what the
value is at the beginning of the

00:14:27.946 --> 00:14:28.269
tree.
 

00:14:28.269 --> 00:14:31.748
And the way you do that is for
every node you say to yourself,

00:14:31.748 --> 00:14:34.999
it doesn't matter which node
you are like this one or that

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:36.710
one, let's call is node S.
 

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:46.874
So the value of node S,
this is the value just after

00:14:46.874 --> 00:14:50.860
paying the coupon.
 

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:53.769
So you've paid the coupon,
you've paid the 9,

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:55.288
now what's the value.
 

00:14:55.288 --> 00:14:59.453
Well, the non-call price,
so let's do non-call,

00:14:59.453 --> 00:15:03.710
non-call bond,
what is the value going to be?

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:12.028
Well, just after paying the 9
here what's the value of what's

00:15:12.028 --> 00:15:13.000
left?
 

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.580
So you're going to have to go
up here.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.138
First of all you're going to
discount by the interest rate

00:15:19.138 --> 00:15:21.510
here, so it's 1 over (1
r_S),

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.820
so you're discounting by the
interest rate there.

00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:31.668
Then half the time you'll go up.
 

00:15:31.668 --> 00:15:33.250
So what will you have to do if
you go up?

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.340
You'll have to pay 9 because
that's the required payment,

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.370
and then you'll be left in the
same situation except that

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.191
you'll be at the up state,
whatever the value is

00:15:44.191 --> 00:15:47.298
there--plus V_Sup.
 

00:15:47.298 --> 00:15:50.548
If this node is S this node we
call S_up and this

00:15:50.548 --> 00:15:52.340
node we call S_down.
 

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.990
So I'm doing this by backward
induction, remember.

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.408
I'm saying, suppose towards the
end of the tree I figured out

00:15:59.408 --> 00:16:02.655
what is the value of the bond
just after making the coupon

00:16:02.655 --> 00:16:03.340
payment.
 

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.946
Since there are no coupon
payments at the end I know the

00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:08.421
value is 0,
so having done it at the end,

00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:11.418
and working my way backwards
now by induction,

00:16:11.418 --> 00:16:13.940
I can figure out the value at
any previous node.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:17.350
So suppose I'm here and I've
already figured out the value of

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:18.428
all future nodes.
 

00:16:18.428 --> 00:16:20.519
The value here is simply going
to be,

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:23.870
value here is,
just after the coupon payment,

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:26.192
is going to be--I'm going to
discount at the interest rate

00:16:26.192 --> 00:16:28.129
here,
1 r_S.

00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:30.496
Half the time I'm going to have
to go up here,

00:16:30.496 --> 00:16:33.601
in which case I'm going to pay
9 and then what am I going to

00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:33.970
do?
 

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:36.649
I'm going to be at a situation
where I've just made the coupon

00:16:36.649 --> 00:16:38.538
payment and I see what the value
left is.

00:16:38.538 --> 00:16:40.250
Well, that's the number we
already calculated.

00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:46.629
So V_Sup 1 half--if I
go down I'm down to here.

00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:49.690
It's 9 again V_Sdown.
 

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.609
So that's pretty simple,
and now I just have to solve it

00:16:53.609 --> 00:16:55.320
by backward induction.
 

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.129
So that's what I did in this
tree.

00:16:57.129 --> 00:17:00.400
Here are the interest rates,
and now back here here's the

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.678
present value of a non-callable
bond.

00:17:02.678 --> 00:17:05.459
So at any node,
let's pick one like this one,

00:17:05.459 --> 00:17:06.660
what's the value?
 

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.144
It says it's 1 over (1 the
interest rate) times the

00:17:11.144 --> 00:17:13.678
probability .5,
that's 1 half,

00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:16.170
times the payment,
that's 9 dollars,

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:21.516
plus what the value would be if
I went up because J 149 is this

00:17:21.516 --> 00:17:22.118
node.
 

00:17:22.118 --> 00:17:27.411
That's J 149 here,
so it's just exactly what I

00:17:27.411 --> 00:17:31.109
wrote,
50 percent probability J 4 is

00:17:31.109 --> 00:17:36.390
the 9 dollars at the top plus
the value of what I would get

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:39.221
here,
plus 1 half times the same 9

00:17:39.221 --> 00:17:42.170
dollars I'd have to pay if I
went down,

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.029
plus the value that I'd get
down here.

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:46.848
So that's an extremely simple
calculation to do,

00:17:46.848 --> 00:17:51.028
and because Excel is a
brilliant--as I said created by

00:17:51.028 --> 00:17:55.127
Kapor whose sister was my
classmate and was two years

00:17:55.127 --> 00:17:58.140
ahead of me at Yale--
Excel immediately

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.220
understands--he called it
Lotus--

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.305
immediately understands that if
you give all these directions

00:18:03.305 --> 00:18:06.338
you can't figure out the value
here unless you know what the

00:18:06.338 --> 00:18:07.420
value is forward.
 

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:10.567
So Excel understands that you
should keep going forward and

00:18:10.567 --> 00:18:13.172
starting at the end,
and at the end it knows what

00:18:13.172 --> 00:18:15.180
the value is because it's just
0.

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:18.281
So having got the value 0 at
the end it then works backwards

00:18:18.281 --> 00:18:21.595
all the way through the tree and
gets the value at the beginning

00:18:21.595 --> 00:18:22.490
and gets 113.
 

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:24.890
So it's exactly what we want to
do,

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.497
and he's just written this
brilliant program that

00:18:27.497 --> 00:18:30.430
understands if there's a
dependency you can't calculate

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.058
this without knowing this.
 

00:18:32.058 --> 00:18:33.680
He says, "Okay,
I don't know this.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.519
I'll go forward into the
program to here.

00:18:35.519 --> 00:18:36.480
I can't do these either.
 

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.818
I'll go all the way to the end.
 

00:18:37.818 --> 00:18:40.130
Now everything is 0,
so I know all these numbers.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.492
Now step-by-step I can go
backwards and get all of

00:18:42.492 --> 00:18:43.118
them."
 

00:18:43.118 --> 00:18:45.568
That's what Excel is doing and
it does it instantly.

00:18:45.568 --> 00:18:47.538
So there's no doubt about that,
right?

00:18:47.538 --> 00:18:50.759
You all are way ahead of me on
that.

00:18:50.759 --> 00:18:53.711
So the value's 113,
that's a huge number,

00:18:53.711 --> 00:18:56.960
so obviously it's a very
generous company.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:03.295
The company may not want to be
so generous, so the company

00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:09.630
says, look, we want to be able
to call the bond at 100.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.619
So that simple option,
what's it going to be?

00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:14.420
What's the value going to be?
 

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.960
Well, obviously the company
could call it right away at 100.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.063
So it's going to make the value
go all the way down to 100

00:19:21.063 --> 00:19:23.348
because the company now has the
option,

00:19:23.348 --> 00:19:26.019
whenever it wants to,
like at the very beginning

00:19:26.019 --> 00:19:29.467
before making the first payment,
it could pay 100 here,

00:19:29.467 --> 00:19:32.980
or it could pay the 9 dollars
and then pay 100 here.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.487
So the question is,
should the company do it,

00:19:36.487 --> 00:19:40.472
and when do you think the
company will exercise the

00:19:40.472 --> 00:19:41.348
option?
 

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:46.490
Why wouldn't the company
exercise the option right away?

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:47.109
So here it is.
 

00:19:47.109 --> 00:19:48.950
The bond's worth 113.
 

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:52.358
Every period the company's
promising to pay 9 dollars.

00:19:52.358 --> 00:19:53.890
That's like a 9 percent
interest.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.463
The interest rate's in the
economy only 8 percent at the

00:19:56.463 --> 00:19:57.259
beginning here.
 

00:19:57.259 --> 00:19:59.608
So it's losing money right from
the start.

00:19:59.608 --> 00:20:01.730
Why shouldn't the company just
say, "Okay,

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.450
we gave ourselves the option,
we're taking it right away.

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.923
We're going to just pay you 100
and cancel the whole thing at

00:20:06.923 --> 00:20:07.829
the beginning."
 

00:20:07.829 --> 00:20:11.259
Why wouldn't they do that?
 

00:20:11.259 --> 00:20:12.318
Okay, hang on for one second.
 

00:20:12.318 --> 00:20:21.328
Someone else,
why wouldn't they do that?

00:20:21.328 --> 00:20:24.825
You see, the puzzle is,
the company has promised to pay

00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:26.118
9 dollars forever.
 

00:20:26.118 --> 00:20:29.028
That's like 9 percent on a
100-dollar coupon.

00:20:29.028 --> 00:20:32.499
The interest rate is only 8
percent now, so the company's

00:20:32.499 --> 00:20:34.420
paying more money,
9 dollars.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.348
It could have borrowed and only
had to pay 8 dollars.

00:20:37.348 --> 00:20:39.630
So the guy buying it is getting
this huge bonus.

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.940
He's getting 9-dollar coupons
instead of 8-dollar coupons.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.067
He's probably telling his
friends who aren't marking to

00:20:46.067 --> 00:20:47.690
market, look at my return.
 

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.828
I've got 9 dollars the first
year.

00:20:49.828 --> 00:20:53.519
Look at that great 9 percent
return I got on my investment of

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:53.890
100.
 

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.369
Why won't the company call it
right at the beginning?

00:20:58.369 --> 00:21:03.980
What's the company waiting for?
 

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:04.680
Yep?
 

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.848
Student: It's hoping
that the interest rate will go

00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:07.230
back up.
 

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:10.132
Prof: Back up,
exactly, because if the

00:21:10.132 --> 00:21:15.065
interest rates go way up--
after a very short amount of

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:20.741
time if the company gets lucky
the interest rates are going to

00:21:20.741 --> 00:21:21.578
go up.
 

00:21:21.578 --> 00:21:23.200
So here are the interest rates,
right?

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.825
So after a very short amount of
time, 2 years,

00:21:25.825 --> 00:21:28.509
you get the up thing,
the interest rates are 11

00:21:28.509 --> 00:21:29.210
percent.
 

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:31.380
So all of a sudden the company
is looking great.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:40.661
It's borrowed at 9 percent and
the interest rates are actually

00:21:40.661 --> 00:21:42.640
11 percent.
 

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.913
Effectively it's borrowing from
the guy, 9 percent,

00:21:45.913 --> 00:21:49.190
and it's able to invest the
money at 11 percent.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:51.422
To put it another way,
the present value of the

00:21:51.422 --> 00:21:53.849
payment's left from then are
much less than 100.

00:21:53.849 --> 00:21:56.279
So it's glad it made the deal.
 

00:21:56.279 --> 00:21:59.423
And on the other hand,
if the interest rate goes down

00:21:59.423 --> 00:22:03.108
far enough then the company will
be able to call the thing.

00:22:03.108 --> 00:22:06.272
Present value of the payments
if it couldn't call would be way

00:22:06.272 --> 00:22:06.740
higher.
 

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.862
Because it can call it can
never suffer worse than having

00:22:10.862 --> 00:22:11.818
to pay 100.
 

00:22:11.818 --> 00:22:16.428
So you see that if the interest
rates are going up or down and

00:22:16.428 --> 00:22:20.732
you couldn't call it then when
interest rates go up that's

00:22:20.732 --> 00:22:25.416
really good news for the company
because now the interest rates

00:22:25.416 --> 00:22:29.269
are over 9 percent on average
going forward,

00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:32.319
so actually the present value
of payments is 98.

00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:33.890
That's less than 100.
 

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:37.746
On the other hand if interest
rates go down then the company's

00:22:37.746 --> 00:22:40.528
really screwed,
now the present value of what

00:22:40.528 --> 00:22:41.730
it owes is 127.
 

00:22:41.730 --> 00:22:44.817
At the beginning it's 113,
so as interest rates go further

00:22:44.817 --> 00:22:47.904
and further down the company's
made a worse and worse bond

00:22:47.904 --> 00:22:50.374
issue,
but it doesn't suffer very much

00:22:50.374 --> 00:22:53.942
because of that because it can
always get out of its deal by

00:22:53.942 --> 00:22:54.788
calling it.
 

00:22:54.788 --> 00:23:01.296
So in fact, astonishingly,
it doesn't even call the first

00:23:01.296 --> 00:23:02.109
time.
 

00:23:02.109 --> 00:23:04.588
So here's the value.
 

00:23:04.588 --> 00:23:07.968
When the company behaves
optimally it won't call the

00:23:07.968 --> 00:23:08.828
first time.
 

00:23:08.828 --> 00:23:11.019
When interest rates go up it
says, "Ah-ha!

00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:13.165
We're going to make money,
that's great,

00:23:13.165 --> 00:23:16.248
but when interest rates go down
now the interest rate's 6

00:23:16.248 --> 00:23:18.230
percent and it's still paying 9.
 

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:20.618
The company is still not going
to call the bond.

00:23:20.618 --> 00:23:23.676
It won't call the bond until
the interest rates go down all

00:23:23.676 --> 00:23:24.890
the way to 5 percent.
 

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:30.555
So anyway, by backward
induction you get the value of

00:23:30.555 --> 00:23:34.913
the callable bond is 95,
which is 95.529,

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:40.578
which is a lot--let's write
those down, in fact.

00:23:40.578 --> 00:23:56.953
So the callable bond,
95.529, and non-call was 113

00:23:56.953 --> 00:24:10.990
point something,
which I forgot already.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:15.561
So I hope you're following
because this is going to get a

00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:20.298
lot more surprising when we do
mortgages, but it's the same

00:24:20.298 --> 00:24:21.848
logic, 113.236.
 

00:24:21.848 --> 00:24:26.079
So the call option is worth 18
percent to the bond.

00:24:26.079 --> 00:24:27.069
It's a huge thing.
 

00:24:27.069 --> 00:24:28.150
It sounds so simple.
 

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:33.170
Of course you should dissolve
the thing for a value of 100.

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.048
That's the only natural thing
to do.

00:24:35.048 --> 00:24:37.430
So it's perfectly reasonable,
you would think,

00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:39.808
for the company to give itself
that option.

00:24:39.808 --> 00:24:42.657
"Look guys we're borrowing
money, but there may be some

00:24:42.657 --> 00:24:44.589
reason why things get too
complicated.

00:24:44.589 --> 00:24:46.710
Our company might close down.
 

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.637
We want to keep our promise,
so we just want to pay off the

00:24:49.637 --> 00:24:52.365
loan at 100, so give us that
option even if our company

00:24:52.365 --> 00:24:53.828
doesn't close down."
 

00:24:53.828 --> 00:24:57.352
Well, the company has just
taken an incredibly valuable

00:24:57.352 --> 00:24:57.940
option.
 

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:04.796
Instead of making a promise
worth 113, it's made a promise

00:25:04.796 --> 00:25:06.119
worth 95.
 

00:25:06.119 --> 00:25:07.019
So any questions about that?
 

00:25:07.019 --> 00:25:09.299
You could all get that and you
all see why that's happening,

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:11.039
and it's a bigger number than
you'd expect.

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:11.670
Yep?
 

00:25:11.670 --> 00:25:13.308
Student: When should
they call it?

00:25:13.308 --> 00:25:14.519
Prof: When should they
call it?

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:20.681
You can tell when they should
call it because--you'll know

00:25:20.681 --> 00:25:26.519
when they call it because if
they do call it what's the

00:25:26.519 --> 00:25:27.598
value?
 

00:25:27.598 --> 00:25:30.820
So I didn't work out
the--what's the backward

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.700
induction?
 

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:32.150
Sorry.
 

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:35.130
So let's write down the formula
when you do call it.

00:25:35.130 --> 00:25:36.380
How could I have forgotten to
do that?

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.410
What do you do when you do call
it?

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.930
So value, how do you figure
this out?

00:25:42.930 --> 00:25:44.230
I just skipped this, sorry.
 

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:49.361
Value of callable bond,
so V_S,

00:25:49.361 --> 00:25:53.210
what is that going to equal?
 

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:57.480
Now you've got an option.
 

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:06.365
So V_S,
remember this is value just

00:26:06.365 --> 00:26:11.009
after coupon payment.
 

00:26:11.009 --> 00:26:14.059
So what is the value just after
the coupon payment?

00:26:14.059 --> 00:26:15.410
That's when you have to call.
 

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.470
So in a second you'll see why
that's the way the rule works.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:22.843
So just after the coupon
payment what's the value of the

00:26:22.843 --> 00:26:23.400
bond?
 

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:28.627
Well now that you have the
option you can pay the minimum

00:26:28.627 --> 00:26:31.150
of the remaining balance.
 

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.190
It's 100 all the time.
 

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.328
This is just going to be 100.
 

00:26:35.328 --> 00:26:39.318
You could pay 100 or you could
keep going.

00:26:39.318 --> 00:26:43.446
So if you keep going it's going
to be 1 r_S times the

00:26:43.446 --> 00:26:47.282
same thing,
1 half, and then you're going

00:26:47.282 --> 00:26:52.190
to have to make the coupon
payment the next up--

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:56.380
so just a second,
where should we go?

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:59.056
So here this is the interest
rate, so at any node,

00:26:59.056 --> 00:27:02.058
you can pick any one like here
in the tree, this one.

00:27:02.058 --> 00:27:05.690
That's the interest rate,
so at that node you could,

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:08.432
if you wanted to after making
the coupon payment there you

00:27:08.432 --> 00:27:10.638
could pay the 100 and say,
"Okay, we've made the

00:27:10.638 --> 00:27:10.920
payment.
 

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.470
I'm making 100 more.
 

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:16.186
Let's just call the whole thing
quits," but if you don't

00:27:16.186 --> 00:27:19.873
you're going to move on,
and when you move on you're

00:27:19.873 --> 00:27:23.897
going to go either up to here,
so that's with probability 1

00:27:23.897 --> 00:27:24.250
half.
 

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:28.509
You have to make the coupon
payment and then again you'll

00:27:28.509 --> 00:27:31.855
have the option of paying your
way out of it,

00:27:31.855 --> 00:27:35.048
dissolving the contract or
continuing.

00:27:35.048 --> 00:27:38.666
So you just have V_SU
because that's exactly the value

00:27:38.666 --> 00:27:42.170
just after making the coupon
payment at node S_U.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:45.174
That's V_SU,
and so it's going to take into

00:27:45.174 --> 00:27:47.660
account that you're minimizing
something.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.338
So you see, V_S,
the value at any node,

00:27:50.338 --> 00:27:54.394
takes into account you could
minimize by possibly paying the

00:27:54.394 --> 00:27:57.828
balance and dissolving it or you
could continue.

00:27:57.828 --> 00:27:59.916
And so if you continue and
things go up you have to make

00:27:59.916 --> 00:28:01.930
the coupon and then you're going
to face a choice,

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.182
but we assume by backward
induction you've already figured

00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:05.369
out the value of that thing.
 

00:28:05.369 --> 00:28:06.509
Maybe it's paying the 100.
 

00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:12.044
Maybe it's not paying the
hundred whatever that is,

00:28:12.044 --> 00:28:16.140
plus 1 half times 9
V_SD.

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:19.140
So the only difference between
this callable--

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.305
non-call case and the call case
is you notice that the second

00:28:23.305 --> 00:28:26.430
term is exactly the same in the
two cases,

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:29.486
but here we've added the
minimum of 100 in that because

00:28:29.486 --> 00:28:32.259
you either could continue or you
could pay 100.

00:28:32.259 --> 00:28:34.977
Of course the values,
V_SU up here and

00:28:34.977 --> 00:28:37.362
V_S,
are not the same as the

00:28:37.362 --> 00:28:41.019
V_S's here because
they've all been concatenated by

00:28:41.019 --> 00:28:42.910
taking the minimum with 100.
 

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:47.028
So the computer now is going to
solve this by backward

00:28:47.028 --> 00:28:51.381
induction, and now how can you
tell what the computer has

00:28:51.381 --> 00:28:52.779
decided to do?
 

00:28:52.779 --> 00:28:56.380
If the computer said it's a
good time to call that means the

00:28:56.380 --> 00:29:00.041
value at that point is going to
be 100 because it's called by

00:29:00.041 --> 00:29:02.848
paying the remaining balance
which is 100.

00:29:02.848 --> 00:29:08.023
So if you go to the present
value of non-call you get all

00:29:08.023 --> 00:29:10.150
these present values.
 

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.674
As the interest rate goes down
you get crushed,

00:29:12.674 --> 00:29:16.133
of course, because you have the
same payments and lower interest

00:29:16.133 --> 00:29:18.220
rates, you're discounting by
less.

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:21.348
But the callable bond,
see, you shouldn't call here.

00:29:21.348 --> 00:29:25.362
It's 99.9 so that means when
the computer took the minimum

00:29:25.362 --> 00:29:28.598
100 in this thing it took this
which was 99.

00:29:28.598 --> 00:29:33.963
It didn't use the option to
call at 100, but if things go

00:29:33.963 --> 00:29:38.180
down again then it's going to
call at 100.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:42.035
So it's got a threshold here
where the interest rate has to

00:29:42.035 --> 00:29:44.960
go pretty far down before it
calls at 100.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.660
It has to go down twice,
but you notice this threshold.

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:52.410
As time goes on the threshold
is going to get tighter.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.078
So even if you're at the same
interest rate four years,

00:29:55.078 --> 00:29:58.710
you know, this is 1,2,
3,4, this is 5 years later,

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:03.252
and the interest rate's gone
down once below the minimum bar

00:30:03.252 --> 00:30:05.788
here--
five years later you will call

00:30:05.788 --> 00:30:09.645
when the interest rate is,
instead of 8 percent,

00:30:09.645 --> 00:30:13.326
is 6.8 percent,
but 1 year later you won't call

00:30:13.326 --> 00:30:17.259
if it's 6.8 percent,
and why is that?

00:30:17.259 --> 00:30:17.910
Well, why is that?
 

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.920
How come if in the first year
the interest rate went from--

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:24.303
remember it started at 8
percent and it goes down to 6.8

00:30:24.303 --> 00:30:28.988
percent here you don't call,
on the other hand if things had

00:30:28.988 --> 00:30:33.740
stayed the same for a few years
and then in year 5,

00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.740
or year whatever this--how many
years have we got here,

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:42.492
1,2, 3, no, year 0,1,
2,3, 4, so if in year 4 the

00:30:42.492 --> 00:30:48.247
interest rate goes down to--
oh, year 5 the interest rate

00:30:48.247 --> 00:30:50.250
goes down to 6.8 percent.
 

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.509
In year 1 if the interest rate
went down from 8 percent to 6.8

00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:56.721
percent you wouldn't call,
but if the interest rate sort

00:30:56.721 --> 00:30:59.987
of bounces around and then in
year 5 it's back down at 6.8

00:30:59.987 --> 00:31:01.420
percent you will call.
 

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:04.182
Why would you call here even
though in exactly the same

00:31:04.182 --> 00:31:05.869
situation you didn't call here?
 

00:31:05.869 --> 00:31:08.009
Why call here and not here?
 

00:31:08.009 --> 00:31:11.105
You can tell where you call
because those are 100s and the

00:31:11.105 --> 00:31:13.548
computer's picked the minimum
equal to 100.

00:31:13.548 --> 00:31:17.932
So why is it that it's going to
call here, but not here even

00:31:17.932 --> 00:31:21.351
though the interest rates are
exactly the same,

00:31:21.351 --> 00:31:23.579
6.8 percent in both cases?
 

00:31:23.579 --> 00:31:24.690
Yes?
 

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:26.849
Student: Because you
can't get to the kind of really

00:31:26.849 --> 00:31:28.900
high interest rates from that
point five years later.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.769
There's not enough time left.
 

00:31:29.769 --> 00:31:30.640
Prof: Exactly.
 

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.056
So the point is the only reason
not to call here--you're paying

00:31:34.056 --> 00:31:35.930
through the nose,
it's horrible.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.470
The interest rate is 6 percent,
you're paying 9.

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:40.663
It's terrible,
but you're hoping maybe things

00:31:40.663 --> 00:31:42.009
are going to turn around.
 

00:31:42.009 --> 00:31:44.521
The interest rate's going to
soar then it's going to be a

00:31:44.521 --> 00:31:45.420
great deal for me.
 

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.398
So I'm willing to have some
short run losses in case I get a

00:31:49.398 --> 00:31:52.862
gigantic gain on the upside,
and I know that I'm protected

00:31:52.862 --> 00:31:55.510
on the downside because if
things go down again I can cut

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.118
my losses and just call it 100.
 

00:31:57.118 --> 00:32:01.660
But if you run out of time,
here the interest rate's 6.8,

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.134
it's still way below 9 percent
which is the coupon you're

00:32:05.134 --> 00:32:08.856
paying and you don't have much
time for the interest rates to

00:32:08.856 --> 00:32:11.455
go back up,
you better call then and cut

00:32:11.455 --> 00:32:12.808
your losses,
exactly.

00:32:12.808 --> 00:32:15.119
So that's the whole logic of
the thing.

00:32:15.119 --> 00:32:16.640
So any questions about that?
 

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.807
And as I said,
the option is worth much more

00:32:21.807 --> 00:32:23.730
than it seems.
 

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:29.279
Could you all do a problem like
this?

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:34.930
You'll find out.
 

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:40.789
So now let me just do one more
example.

00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:42.358
I want to do an aside here.
 

00:32:42.358 --> 00:32:48.940
Suppose that we had a trinomial
tree instead of binomial tree.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:53.351
So I have the same picture,
but instead of two things

00:32:53.351 --> 00:32:58.017
happening I say three things
could happen or five things

00:32:58.017 --> 00:32:59.460
could happen.
 

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:02.848
So I would take the same tree
and put this here.

00:33:02.848 --> 00:33:06.838
I'd always allow for something
happening in the middle.

00:33:06.838 --> 00:33:08.720
And then, of course,
it gets more complicated and

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.150
I'm not going to be able to draw
it because now this thing,

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:13.490
three things could happen from
here,

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:15.880
and from here three things
could happen.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:19.373
From here I have three things,
so I have trinomial tree like

00:33:19.373 --> 00:33:22.568
that, right, where always three
things could happen.

00:33:22.568 --> 00:33:27.759
So from here I could go here,
stay the same or go up.

00:33:27.759 --> 00:33:31.404
Now, if I had a trinomial tree,
and of course you could think

00:33:31.404 --> 00:33:34.383
of an N-nomial tree,
would I keep the same numbers

00:33:34.383 --> 00:33:34.930
here?
 

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.523
Well, I can't keep the same
numbers because if I have 1 half

00:33:37.523 --> 00:33:40.205
and 1 half that doesn't allow
any probability for going in the

00:33:40.205 --> 00:33:40.690
middle.
 

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:46.608
So I'll put 1 quarter here,
and 1 quarter.

00:33:46.608 --> 00:33:50.150
Now, what do I have to do to
these numbers?

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:53.819
Well, the drift I'm going to
leave the same because on

00:33:53.819 --> 00:33:56.660
average it's still going to go
up by d.

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:01.853
So this was,
remember, r_0 e to

00:34:01.853 --> 00:34:04.450
the minus sigma d.
 

00:34:04.450 --> 00:34:06.660
So this is the probability 1
half.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.242
I just made up three numbers,
1 quarter, 1 quarter and 1 half

00:34:09.242 --> 00:34:10.320
for the trinomial tree.
 

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:13.079
Suppose those are my numbers?
 

00:34:13.079 --> 00:34:16.485
If I want to make this tree
comparable to the binomial

00:34:16.485 --> 00:34:19.250
tree--what does it mean to be
comparable?

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:24.510
It means that the standard
deviation and the expectation of

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:28.230
the interest rate ought to be
the same.

00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:32.367
So I'm using the fact that if
they're normally distributed

00:34:32.367 --> 00:34:35.199
random variables all I need to
know--

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:41.414
so if there were millions of
successor interest rates and I

00:34:41.414 --> 00:34:45.398
took them with this--
if there are millions of these

00:34:45.398 --> 00:34:48.536
successor interest rates then as
long as the standard deviation

00:34:48.536 --> 00:34:50.460
and the expectation were the
same,

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.940
no matter how I put the
probabilities I'd get almost the

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:55.554
same variable because it would
be normally distributed with

00:34:55.554 --> 00:34:57.809
that standard deviation and that
expectation,

00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:01.289
and normally distributed,
as I said,

00:35:01.289 --> 00:35:04.815
means it's determined by
standard deviation and

00:35:04.815 --> 00:35:05.889
expectation.
 

00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:15.710
So I've just picked 1 quarter,
1 half and 1 quarter.

00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.818
It's as if I had two moves
where you could get two ups to

00:35:18.818 --> 00:35:21.869
go here, an up or a down,
or a down or an up to go here,

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:23.480
and two downs to go here.
 

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.230
That's why a picked 1 quarter,
1 half and 1 quarter.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:30.929
It's like I added 2 six-month
moves here and called it a

00:35:30.929 --> 00:35:32.380
1-year move.
 

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.818
So if I keep dividing the
process and having it happen

00:35:35.818 --> 00:35:38.898
quicker and quicker,
by the central limit theorem

00:35:38.898 --> 00:35:41.905
I'm going to get something
normally distributed with a

00:35:41.905 --> 00:35:44.460
corresponding standard deviation
and mean.

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:50.773
So what is going to end up as
the standard deviation here and

00:35:50.773 --> 00:35:51.510
here?
 

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:55.809
Well, I know to get the same
variance before,

00:35:55.809 --> 00:36:00.847
I had 1 half sigma squared 1
half sigma squared that equaled

00:36:00.847 --> 00:36:05.989
sigma squared,
but now my variance is going to

00:36:05.989 --> 00:36:09.980
be 1 quarter sigma--
this is the new sigma hat

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:13.318
squared, 1 quarter sigma hat
squared because I'll go down

00:36:13.318 --> 00:36:16.902
whatever this sigma,
so now I should put a sigma hat

00:36:16.902 --> 00:36:17.320
here.
 

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.110
So 1 quarter sigma hat squared.
 

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.483
So if I look at the variance of
the exponent it's going to be a

00:36:23.483 --> 00:36:27.786
1 quarter sigma hat squared 1
quarter sigma hat squared 1 half

00:36:27.786 --> 00:36:31.949
times 0 because half the time
you just get the average.

00:36:31.949 --> 00:36:39.215
So therefore it means 1 half
sigma hat squared has to equal

00:36:39.215 --> 00:36:41.219
sigma squared.
 

00:36:41.219 --> 00:36:45.380
So therefore sigma hat squared
has to equal 2 sigma squared,

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:49.753
and therefore sigma hat has to
equal the square root of 2 times

00:36:49.753 --> 00:36:50.460
sigma.
 

00:36:50.460 --> 00:37:01.440
So I should put the square root
of 2 here and the square root of

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.010
2 here.
 

00:37:03.010 --> 00:37:08.306
So now if I do a trinomial,
for the trinomial to be similar

00:37:08.306 --> 00:37:14.059
to the binomial the binomial
would be sort of here and here,

00:37:14.059 --> 00:37:16.070
and the trinomial there's a lot
probability,

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:17.110
you're stuck in the middle.
 

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.530
So to get the same kind of
average spread I'm going to have

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:21.744
to have this thing sticking
further out and this thing

00:37:21.744 --> 00:37:24.307
sticking further out,
but if I choose my numbers by

00:37:24.307 --> 00:37:26.500
multiplying by the square root
of 2 here,

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.958
and the square root of 2 here,
the standard deviation of this

00:37:29.958 --> 00:37:33.014
trinomial is the same as the
standard deviation of the

00:37:33.014 --> 00:37:36.300
binomial and the expectation of
the two are the same.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:39.371
And I could do the same thing
with an N-nomial or an

00:37:39.371 --> 00:37:43.224
any-number thing I wanted to and
I could always pick the standard

00:37:43.224 --> 00:37:46.472
deviation properly,
pick these nodes properly so

00:37:46.472 --> 00:37:50.208
that I had the same standard
deviation and expectation as I

00:37:50.208 --> 00:37:52.719
did with the original binomial
tree.

00:37:52.719 --> 00:37:55.788
So just because I've got three
nodes or five nodes on average

00:37:55.788 --> 00:37:57.630
they can turn out to be the
same,

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.840
and the average spread,
the average spread squared can

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.960
also be the same as the
binomial.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:10.019
And if I do that I'm going to
get a shockingly similar answer.

00:38:10.019 --> 00:38:14.760
So let's just see what we get.
 

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.559
So what do I have to do now?
 

00:38:16.559 --> 00:38:19.230
I have to go to trinomial.
 

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.940
So what did we do here?
 

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:25.628
We did--9 percent was the
coupon, and the interest rates

00:38:25.628 --> 00:38:29.719
start at 8 percent,
and the volatility was 16.

00:38:29.719 --> 00:38:37.889
So if I go to trinomial,
I put 9 percent to start,

00:38:37.889 --> 00:38:42.083
30 years, 8 percent the
starting rate and volatility is

00:38:42.083 --> 00:38:44.230
16,
and now I have to do the up

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:46.762
multiplier,
and by doing that you see I've

00:38:46.762 --> 00:38:50.150
multiplied up there in that
formula there's a square root of

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:51.889
2 there,
2 square root of 2.

00:38:51.889 --> 00:38:55.309
So I've got just a slightly
more complicated thing.

00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:58.405
I've just multiplied by the
square root of 2 and that's how

00:38:58.405 --> 00:39:00.871
I've got all my nodes,
so otherwise it's the same

00:39:00.871 --> 00:39:03.440
thing and I do the same backward
induction except instead of

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.744
being 1 half,
1 half I put 1 quarter here,

00:39:06.744 --> 00:39:10.286
and 1 quarter here,
so it'll be 1 quarter

00:39:10.286 --> 00:39:14.059
V_SU 1 quarter
V_SD 1 half,

00:39:14.059 --> 00:39:18.177
you stay the same,
which will be 9

00:39:18.177 --> 00:39:24.027
V_Ssame,
whatever that is--so I probably

00:39:24.027 --> 00:39:25.070
lost you.
 

00:39:25.070 --> 00:39:29.461
So let me just say I want to
convince you that this binomial

00:39:29.461 --> 00:39:32.440
assumption is not such a special
case.

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.994
So you should be thinking to
yourself, two things happening

00:39:34.994 --> 00:39:36.360
next year, that's ridiculous.
 

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.530
I could imagine a million
things happening next year.

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:40.159
So I say, okay I believe it.
 

00:39:40.159 --> 00:39:41.949
A million things could happen
next year,

00:39:41.949 --> 00:39:44.110
so I'm going to write down a
million things,

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:47.643
not any million things,
I'm going to say let's suppose

00:39:47.643 --> 00:39:51.177
that instead of two things
happening in a year I say I

00:39:51.177 --> 00:39:55.378
divide what can happen over the
year into a million different up

00:39:55.378 --> 00:39:56.780
and down moves.
 

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:59.489
Now, in order to replicate sort
of the original binomial,

00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:02.610
those million up and down
moves, let's say 250 of them,

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:04.123
1 every day,
those daily moves,

00:40:04.123 --> 00:40:05.960
of course,
are going to be much smaller

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:06.889
than the 1-year move.
 

00:40:06.889 --> 00:40:11.920
But if I make the drift be the
old drift divided by 250,

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:17.644
and the new standard deviation
of the tiny things be the right

00:40:17.644 --> 00:40:22.541
ratio of the standard deviation,
then when I compute the

00:40:22.541 --> 00:40:26.534
standard deviation of all the
nodes here I'll get the same

00:40:26.534 --> 00:40:30.387
standard deviation as the
binomial and the same drift in

00:40:30.387 --> 00:40:31.650
the binomial.
 

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.210
So if I ended up with 3 nodes
here I would just be multiplying

00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:36.730
by the square root of 2.
 

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:41.065
And so by having a trinomial
thing with a slightly adjusted

00:40:41.065 --> 00:40:43.541
move up and down,
slightly spreading it and

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.150
putting some probability in the
middle,

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:48.460
I can have the same variance
and the same expectation.

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.155
If I had thousands of nodes
here I'd also have the same

00:40:51.155 --> 00:40:53.601
variance and the same
expectation, and so I did it

00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:54.949
just for the trinomial.
 

00:40:54.949 --> 00:40:57.050
So let's see what happens to
the value.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:01.679
If we look now at the interest
rates, it was an uglier thing.

00:41:01.679 --> 00:41:05.699
I couldn't do it quite as--I
was too lazy to do it as neatly,

00:41:05.699 --> 00:41:09.311
so the interest rates started
at 8 percent and now they can go

00:41:09.311 --> 00:41:12.650
up to 10 or down to 6.3,
and then the next period they

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:14.329
can go up to 12 and 1 half.
 

00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:16.639
So you see there are different
moves here.

00:41:16.639 --> 00:41:20.164
Remember the other one was 6.8
and 9, so if you don't get the

00:41:20.164 --> 00:41:23.570
same interest rate right away
you move more violently up or

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:24.099
down.
 

00:41:24.099 --> 00:41:26.378
So these three things,
these two are spread out

00:41:26.378 --> 00:41:27.369
further than this.
 

00:41:27.369 --> 00:41:31.719
So what happens to the price?
 

00:41:31.719 --> 00:41:37.985
The present value of the
non-call bond is 113.230 and

00:41:37.985 --> 00:41:41.599
what was it before,
113.236.

00:41:41.599 --> 00:41:43.250
It's not so different.
 

00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:48.699
And if I look now at the value
of the callable bond it's 95.142

00:41:48.699 --> 00:41:53.710
and what was it before,
95.529, a little bit different.

00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:59.067
So you can see that the
trinomial thing gives you almost

00:41:59.067 --> 00:42:02.380
the same answer as the binomial.
 

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:05.880
So I don't want to say anything
more than that.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.172
So no matter how many nodes you
have in the tree the binomial's

00:42:09.172 --> 00:42:11.827
going to give a good
approximation provided that we

00:42:11.827 --> 00:42:13.050
shrink the periods.
 

00:42:13.050 --> 00:42:15.836
Instead of looking at a year,
looking at daily moves or

00:42:15.836 --> 00:42:18.778
minute by minute moves,
as long as those are binomial

00:42:18.778 --> 00:42:21.039
over a year a million things can
happen.

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:24.092
And so you can restrict
yourself to binomial without any

00:42:24.092 --> 00:42:27.590
loss of generality just taking
the time period short enough,

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:31.153
because if it's a daily
binomial over a year there's 250

00:42:31.153 --> 00:42:35.237
outcomes or something and so for
a minute there are thousands of

00:42:35.237 --> 00:42:39.385
outcomes over a year even though
each move is binomial and you'll

00:42:39.385 --> 00:42:41.070
get the same answer.
 

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:44.469
So that's that.
 

00:42:44.469 --> 00:42:47.771
All right, so we've done the
callable bond idea,

00:42:47.771 --> 00:42:50.369
and the call option is worth a
lot.

00:42:50.369 --> 00:42:53.329
Now, let's take a more concrete
example,

00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:56.820
the one that you've all heard
your parents talking about,

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.880
if you don't own a house
yourself, which is a mortgage.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:03.820
And I just want to do the same
thing and help you start to

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.730
think about how to value
mortgages.

00:43:05.730 --> 00:43:07.480
So what's a mortgage?
 

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.938
A mortgage is,
you don't have the balloon

00:43:09.938 --> 00:43:11.230
payment at the end.
 

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:28.590
You pay the same amount each
period.

00:43:28.590 --> 00:43:29.789
Let's take a mortgage.
 

00:43:29.789 --> 00:43:32.530
So which example have I done
here?

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:40.039
So I've got a mortgage rate of
7 percent, a 7 percent coupon,

00:43:40.039 --> 00:43:45.172
you can see,
and it's a 30 year fixed rate

00:43:45.172 --> 00:43:46.800
mortgage.
 

00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:54.610
Now, how much does that mean
you have to pay every year?

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:56.030
So, every year,
what are you going to pay?

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:57.329
You're not going to pay 7.
 

00:43:57.329 --> 00:43:59.070
What this means is,
whatever X you pay--

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.989
every year that's your annual
payment--

00:44:02.989 --> 00:44:05.539
the 30th year you're still
going to pay X,

00:44:05.539 --> 00:44:14.286
but if I took this all over
1.07 X over 1.07 squared this

00:44:14.286 --> 00:44:23.969
over 1.07 cubed this over 1.07
to the 30th I would get 100,

00:44:23.969 --> 00:44:25.909
equals 100.
 

00:44:25.909 --> 00:44:30.849
So that's how X is chosen,
so that the mortgage is an

00:44:30.849 --> 00:44:36.264
annuity of constant X whose
present value at the coupon is

00:44:36.264 --> 00:44:37.880
equal to 100.
 

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:41.592
That's how you define the
payment on a mortgage,

00:44:41.592 --> 00:44:45.699
but a mortgage has to be
defined more completely than

00:44:45.699 --> 00:44:46.409
that.
 

00:44:46.409 --> 00:44:50.557
You also have to say what do
you get by dissolving the

00:44:50.557 --> 00:44:53.690
mortgage, how much do you have
to pay?

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:56.650
So right away you have to pay
100.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:00.530
What would you have to pay here
if you dissolved the mortgage

00:45:00.530 --> 00:45:08.056
right after the--
so remaining balance equals

00:45:08.056 --> 00:45:19.719
payment just after coupon
necessary to dissolve the

00:45:19.719 --> 00:45:22.518
mortgage.
 

00:45:22.518 --> 00:45:26.590
So at the very beginning the
guy gave you 100.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:29.722
If you want to dissolve it and
undo it you should be able to do

00:45:29.722 --> 00:45:32.905
it for 100, but what about after
the very first year you've paid

00:45:32.905 --> 00:45:33.210
X?
 

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:40.440
By the way, X in this case is
going to work out to 8.05.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:43.889
If you solve for X you get 8.05.
 

00:45:43.889 --> 00:45:48.260
That 8.05 discounted at 7
percent gives you 100.

00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:52.710
So obviously X has to be bigger
than 7 because if it were 7

00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:57.239
everywhere you'd need 107 at the
very end to make it 100.

00:45:57.239 --> 00:46:00.456
Of course at the very end
that's 30 years later,

00:46:00.456 --> 00:46:04.152
so that extra 100 can be
compensated by an extra 1,1.05

00:46:04.152 --> 00:46:05.659
all the way along.
 

00:46:05.659 --> 00:46:09.210
1.05 all the way along is just
the same as an extra 100 at the

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:09.559
end.
 

00:46:09.559 --> 00:46:11.449
So the payment is 8.05.
 

00:46:11.449 --> 00:46:14.659
So if you're paying a 7 percent
mortgage your annual payment is

00:46:14.659 --> 00:46:16.420
going to be more than 7 percent.
 

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:23.900
It's going to be 8.05.
 

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.668
So that's the 7 percent coupon
of the mortgage,

00:46:27.668 --> 00:46:29.389
coupon of mortgage.
 

00:46:29.389 --> 00:46:32.965
Now, if you want to get out of
the mortgage it's called

00:46:32.965 --> 00:46:33.760
prepaying.
 

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.289
What would you have to pay here
to get out of the mortgage do

00:46:36.289 --> 00:46:36.880
you suppose?
 

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:40.730
What's the only logical thing
to have written in the contract?

00:46:40.730 --> 00:46:42.289
Student: Penalty.
 

00:46:42.289 --> 00:46:43.356
Prof: Well,
you could pay a penalty,

00:46:43.356 --> 00:46:44.550
but what if you don't want to
have a penalty?

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:48.219
Then what should the guy pay to
get out of the mortgage?

00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:48.789
Yeah?
 

00:46:48.789 --> 00:46:49.909
Student: The remaining
balance.

00:46:49.909 --> 00:46:51.380
Prof: The remaining
balance, yes,

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:52.739
but what is the remaining
balance?

00:46:52.739 --> 00:46:55.239
That's the question,
what is the remaining balance.

00:46:55.239 --> 00:46:56.940
Well, maybe you know what the
answer is.

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.170
Student: It's the
present value at the time.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:00.599
Prof: Of what's left.
 

00:47:00.599 --> 00:47:03.429
So the guy here,
the remaining balance,

00:47:03.429 --> 00:47:06.778
B_1,
ought to be this number without

00:47:06.778 --> 00:47:07.449
this.
 

00:47:07.449 --> 00:47:10.672
You've only got 29 payments,
only you're going to put a 1

00:47:10.672 --> 00:47:11.710
here now, right?
 

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:15.717
So it's B_1 squared
and B to the 29th because you've

00:47:15.717 --> 00:47:17.820
made the first coupon payment.
 

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:21.351
You've got 29 years left
assuming the same terms as

00:47:21.351 --> 00:47:24.250
before it still is a 7 percent
coupon,

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:28.516
so you should discount the
remaining 29 years at 7 percent

00:47:28.516 --> 00:47:30.239
to get B_1.
 

00:47:30.239 --> 00:47:32.679
So that's what B_1 is.
 

00:47:32.679 --> 00:47:39.610
So as you can see in the thing
B_1 is 98.94.

00:47:39.610 --> 00:47:43.960
Now, 98.94 is an interesting
number.

00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:57.630
You notice that the 8.05 minus
7 happens to equal--that plus

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:10.840
B_1 has to equal 100,
which is B_0.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:12.659
So why is that?
 

00:48:12.659 --> 00:48:15.590
So you started owing the guy
100.

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:17.293
You've borrowed 100,
you own him 100,

00:48:17.293 --> 00:48:19.710
and he's sort of charging you 7
percent interest.

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:21.139
That's the way the deal works.
 

00:48:21.139 --> 00:48:24.250
So you would have expected to
only pay 7 dollars next period.

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.789
That's to keep up with the 7
percent interest.

00:48:26.789 --> 00:48:31.559
Remember, why did the old
mortgages go from the balloon

00:48:31.559 --> 00:48:33.150
payment to this?
 

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:37.226
Because in the Depression in
1933 every single farmer,

00:48:37.226 --> 00:48:40.302
practically,
who owed the 109 because his

00:48:40.302 --> 00:48:43.150
mortgage was coming up
defaulted.

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:46.579
So the lenders decided they
didn't want to be facing that

00:48:46.579 --> 00:48:48.599
situation where a guy owed 109.
 

00:48:48.599 --> 00:48:51.297
They'd rather have the guy pay
X every period where there's

00:48:51.297 --> 00:48:53.949
never this gigantic payment that
he's going to default.

00:48:53.949 --> 00:48:57.867
In fact, by paying X every
period that lender's in a safer

00:48:57.867 --> 00:48:59.380
and safer situation.
 

00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.409
Why is that?
 

00:49:00.409 --> 00:49:04.570
Because he's asking for X which
is 8 dollars even though the

00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:07.954
interest is 7 dollars,
so the homeowner is paying

00:49:07.954 --> 00:49:08.590
8.05.
 

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:09.800
The interest was only 7.
 

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:13.690
So he's making an extra payment
of 1.05 dollars.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:15.989
So what do you do with the
extra 1.05 dollars?

00:49:15.989 --> 00:49:17.268
You write down the balance.
 

00:49:17.268 --> 00:49:19.539
You say you've overpaid me by
1.05.

00:49:19.539 --> 00:49:21.699
I'm no longer going to say you
owe 100.

00:49:21.699 --> 00:49:27.960
You're going to owe,
now, 100 - 1.05.

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:33.632
1.05 had a few decimal places
after it, and so it's going to

00:49:33.632 --> 00:49:34.980
be 98.94136.
 

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:39.231
So that's this gap,
so B_0 -

00:49:39.231 --> 00:49:41.070
B_1.
 

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:46.605
The balance went down by
exactly what the overpayment was

00:49:46.605 --> 00:49:48.780
beyond the interest.
 

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:52.309
And so the next time the
balance is going to go down even

00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:55.335
further because the next time
the balance is only

00:49:55.335 --> 00:49:56.469
B_1.
 

00:49:56.469 --> 00:50:00.085
The next time what the guy
owes--if he was just paying the

00:50:00.085 --> 00:50:03.699
interest he ought to owe only
.07 times B_1,

00:50:03.699 --> 00:50:06.820
and yet he's still going to be
paying 8.05,

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:10.449
so B_1 -
B_2.

00:50:10.449 --> 00:50:13.434
So the balance B_2 is
going to go down even more,

00:50:13.434 --> 00:50:16.057
so the gap from 100 to
B_1 is a very small

00:50:16.057 --> 00:50:16.469
one.
 

00:50:16.469 --> 00:50:19.458
It's going to be bigger from
B_1 to B_2

00:50:19.458 --> 00:50:22.293
and keep getting bigger and
bigger because each time the

00:50:22.293 --> 00:50:24.525
guy's paying 8.05,
but what he owes,

00:50:24.525 --> 00:50:27.684
the balance that he owes on,
that he's basically borrowed

00:50:27.684 --> 00:50:29.889
the money on is a smaller and
smaller number,

00:50:29.889 --> 00:50:33.065
so he's overpaying the 7
percent interest by a bigger and

00:50:33.065 --> 00:50:36.469
bigger amount and the balance
goes down by more and more each

00:50:36.469 --> 00:50:36.980
time.
 

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:41.626
All right, to put it another
way, if you take the first thing

00:50:41.626 --> 00:50:45.188
is, B_1 is X times
1.07,1.07 squared,

00:50:45.188 --> 00:50:46.659
1.07 to the 29.
 

00:50:46.659 --> 00:50:51.567
B_2 is X 1.07 blah,
blah, blah, X times 1.07 to the

00:50:51.567 --> 00:50:52.139
28th.
 

00:50:52.139 --> 00:50:55.414
So the difference between this
and this is the last payment

00:50:55.414 --> 00:50:57.389
which is 1 over 1.07 to the
29th.

00:50:57.389 --> 00:51:01.043
The difference between this and
this is the last payment which

00:51:01.043 --> 00:51:02.780
is 1 over 1.07 to the 30th.
 

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.460
And so as that final maturity
gets smaller and smaller the gap

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:09.478
gets bigger and bigger,
so I'm just saying the same

00:51:09.478 --> 00:51:11.170
thing in different ways.
 

00:51:11.170 --> 00:51:13.739
So are there any questions
about this?

00:51:13.739 --> 00:51:16.630
Did I go too fast or are you
with me?

00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:18.230
Somebody ask a question if
you're lost.

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.090
Yes?
 

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:21.739
Student: Why don't we
discount B_1?

00:51:21.739 --> 00:51:22.730
Prof: Why do I what?
 

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:25.139
Student: Discount
B_1?

00:51:25.139 --> 00:51:26.760
Prof: I'm sorry,
why do I--say it louder.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:27.679
Student: Discount.
 

00:51:27.679 --> 00:51:29.059
Prof: Why do I discount
what?

00:51:29.059 --> 00:51:31.987
Student: Why don't we
because you are subtracting the

00:51:31.987 --> 00:51:34.268
amount from the 0
&gt;?

00:51:34.268 --> 00:51:36.429
Prof: Yes this,
so let me say this again.

00:51:36.429 --> 00:51:40.400
You borrowed 100.
 

00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:45.951
The coupon is the agreed upon
interest, so you should owe the

00:51:45.951 --> 00:51:50.114
guy 7 dollars,
or 107 dollars the next period,

00:51:50.114 --> 00:51:51.039
right?
 

00:51:51.039 --> 00:51:51.989
Not 100 any more.
 

00:51:51.989 --> 00:51:52.949
There's 7 percent interest.
 

00:51:52.949 --> 00:51:56.579
Now you owe the guy 107, right?
 

00:51:56.579 --> 00:52:02.380
But at that moment when you
owed him 107 you paid him 8.05.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.938
So the guy says,
look, I lent you 100,

00:52:05.938 --> 00:52:10.650
I expect 107 back next period,
you pay me 8.05.

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:18.960
That's 8.05,
so what's left that you owe me?

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.670
It's 100 minus the 1.05.
 

00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:32.550
So 98.4 something,
so let me just say it again.

00:52:32.550 --> 00:52:33.869
You borrowed 100.
 

00:52:33.869 --> 00:52:36.670
The next year you owe 107.
 

00:52:36.670 --> 00:52:39.199
We've already taken into
account the interest rate.

00:52:39.199 --> 00:52:41.449
It's 107, so we're sitting in
next year.

00:52:41.449 --> 00:52:42.750
We're no longer sitting back
here.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:45.199
B_1 is as of next
year.

00:52:45.199 --> 00:52:48.987
So you should really by rights
be owed now, the lender should

00:52:48.987 --> 00:52:52.018
be owed 107 now because he lent
100 last year.

00:52:52.018 --> 00:52:55.682
The agreed upon interest is 7
percent so he should be getting

00:52:55.682 --> 00:52:56.659
107 this year.
 

00:52:56.659 --> 00:52:57.820
What is he getting?
 

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:05.858
He's getting 8.05,
so what's left is 107 - 8.05

00:53:05.858 --> 00:53:13.373
and that's what we have,
what's left is 107,

00:53:13.373 --> 00:53:16.869
is exactly that.
 

00:53:16.869 --> 00:53:21.414
Right, so this is 7 he got
paid, so if I write it this way

00:53:21.414 --> 00:53:25.925
107 he got paid 8.05,
so 107 I'm just rewriting the

00:53:25.925 --> 00:53:30.925
same thing,
107 - 8.05 is going to be the

00:53:30.925 --> 00:53:36.324
new B_1,
which just happens to equal 90

00:53:36.324 --> 00:53:45.702
whatever that is,
98.05, something like that,

00:53:45.702 --> 00:53:49.659
98.95, right?
 

00:53:49.659 --> 00:53:53.909
So this is 1.05,
so 1.05 plus this is 100.

00:53:53.909 --> 00:53:57.400
So 107 - 8.05 is 98.95.
 

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:58.599
You agree with that, right?
 

00:53:58.599 --> 00:53:59.260
Student: Yeah.
 

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:02.141
Prof: So what I'm saying
is a year later you were owed

00:54:02.141 --> 00:54:02.429
107.
 

00:54:02.429 --> 00:54:05.579
You were paid 8.05,
so obviously what's left that

00:54:05.579 --> 00:54:09.449
you're owed is the difference,
98.95 and that's exactly what

00:54:09.449 --> 00:54:12.139
the equation was that I wrote
before.

00:54:12.139 --> 00:54:17.710
Any other questions?
 

00:54:17.710 --> 00:54:21.099
So you can always divide a
mortgage payment into the

00:54:21.099 --> 00:54:25.425
interest part--
so any mortgage payment X can

00:54:25.425 --> 00:54:31.925
be divided into the interest so
now let's erase this and I'm

00:54:31.925 --> 00:54:35.010
saying it in other words.
 

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:37.994
So your payments are X
everywhere to the last period

00:54:37.994 --> 00:54:41.449
and your remaining balance is
going to be B_1,

00:54:41.449 --> 00:54:43.972
B_2,
B_3 and

00:54:43.972 --> 00:54:47.800
B_30 which is
obviously equal to 0.

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:51.240
So you can always get out of
the mortgage by paying--after

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.742
you make a coupon payment X you
can get out of it by paying

00:54:54.742 --> 00:54:55.829
B_2.
 

00:54:55.829 --> 00:55:04.590
So your mortgage payment is
going to be divided into the

00:55:04.590 --> 00:55:13.349
interest, and then the scheduled
principal reduction.

00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:15.409
So here you pay 8.05.
 

00:55:15.409 --> 00:55:18.880
The interest was only 7 percent
so you've overpaid.

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.469
So that's why the balance goes
down.

00:55:20.469 --> 00:55:23.572
That's the scheduled
balance--It's called principal,

00:55:23.572 --> 00:55:25.639
but scheduled balance
reduction.

00:55:25.639 --> 00:55:30.047
And if you want you can prepay
and pay off part of the

00:55:30.047 --> 00:55:33.539
remaining balance,
any part you want to.

00:55:33.539 --> 00:55:35.190
So let me say it again.
 

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:38.201
In some period,
let's say 3,

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:41.768
what could you do in period 3?
 

00:55:41.768 --> 00:55:45.594
Well, by the time you've waited
to period 3 you've got to pay

00:55:45.594 --> 00:55:46.550
the coupon X.
 

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:51.557
Now, the coupon X is way in
excess of 7 percent times

00:55:51.557 --> 00:55:53.099
B_2.
 

00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:56.639
It's 8 and 7 percent of 100 is
less than X.

00:55:56.639 --> 00:55:58.570
We're already down to a balance
of B_2.

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:01.909
So the X is bigger than 7
percent of B_2.

00:56:01.909 --> 00:56:04.525
So 7 percent of B_2
is the interest,

00:56:04.525 --> 00:56:06.965
but on top of that you paid
more than that,

00:56:06.965 --> 00:56:10.280
so that extra you paid reduced
the remaining balance.

00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:13.480
That's the scheduled reduction
in the remaining balance.

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.190
You paid that off.
 

00:56:14.190 --> 00:56:16.608
You had no choice about that,
but now in addition,

00:56:16.608 --> 00:56:18.632
if you want,
you can pay the B_3

00:56:18.632 --> 00:56:20.510
and get rid of the whole
mortgage.

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:22.010
That's the rules of a mortgage.
 

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:23.920
Is that clear to everybody?
 

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:32.369
So any mortgage that you get,
works by those rules.

00:56:32.369 --> 00:56:36.190
So we have to figure out the
value of the mortgage.

00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:37.710
Somehow I feel I'm going too
fast.

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:40.380
Could someone ask a question if
you're lost?

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:41.800
I need to pick out--yes?
 

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:44.572
Student: So what you
just said applies that as time

00:56:44.572 --> 00:56:47.344
goes on you pay a bigger and
bigger chunk of the principal

00:56:47.344 --> 00:56:48.949
with each successive payment?
 

00:56:48.949 --> 00:56:49.599
Prof: Yes.
 

00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:52.610
So the mortgage is called an
amortizing mortgage.

00:56:52.610 --> 00:56:55.445
This was a great invention at
the time of the Depression,

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:56.610
after the Depression.
 

00:56:56.610 --> 00:56:59.409
It probably had been invented
before, but was used in a big

00:56:59.409 --> 00:57:00.230
way after that.
 

00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:02.639
I don't know the person's name
who invented it.

00:57:02.639 --> 00:57:08.090
First it has the property that
you're always paying more.

00:57:08.090 --> 00:57:10.847
Because you're paying level
payments you must always be

00:57:10.847 --> 00:57:12.329
paying your principal down.
 

00:57:12.329 --> 00:57:15.380
That makes the lender safer and
safer because it's the same

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:17.590
house protecting his loan as
collateral.

00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:20.947
We haven't come to collateral
and how the whole world depends

00:57:20.947 --> 00:57:23.576
on collateral yet,
but believe me we're going to

00:57:23.576 --> 00:57:24.360
get there.
 

00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:26.528
And so we haven't gotten to
collateral yet,

00:57:26.528 --> 00:57:29.163
but when we get to it,
the lender's protected by the

00:57:29.163 --> 00:57:29.679
house.
 

00:57:29.679 --> 00:57:32.409
The amount that's owed to him
started at 100.

00:57:32.409 --> 00:57:35.889
It's getting lower every period
so he's feeling safer and safer.

00:57:35.889 --> 00:57:38.782
That contrasts to the old
lenders during the Depression

00:57:38.782 --> 00:57:41.570
who were at the most vulnerable
right at the end--

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:44.670
oh, I've lost it--most
vulnerable right at the end.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:49.242
Here these lenders are getting
less and less vulnerable as time

00:57:49.242 --> 00:57:49.980
goes on.
 

00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:52.079
So that's the advantage of an
amortizing mortgage.

00:57:52.079 --> 00:57:56.307
Now, it so happens that the
rate of amortization gets faster

00:57:56.307 --> 00:57:57.239
and faster.
 

00:57:57.239 --> 00:58:00.179
So these numbers start at 100
and stay pretty close to 100,

00:58:00.179 --> 00:58:03.173
and then they go down pretty
fast, which is what his point

00:58:03.173 --> 00:58:04.768
is,
and that's absolutely right.

00:58:04.768 --> 00:58:09.297
And so if you look at the
remaining balances here in this

00:58:09.297 --> 00:58:13.340
chart it started at 100,
went to 98, went to 97,96,

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.119
95, now 93,92,
90.

00:58:15.119 --> 00:58:17.639
They're going down faster and
faster.

00:58:17.639 --> 00:58:22.659
If you keep going you're going
to see that they start leaping

00:58:22.659 --> 00:58:25.170
down from 76 to 73,73 to 70.
 

00:58:25.170 --> 00:58:28.710
Now they're starting to go from
43 to 38.

00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:30.862
They're really,
by percentages,

00:58:30.862 --> 00:58:34.380
going way down really fast,
21 to 14 to 7 to 0.

00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:37.849
So they go down really fast at
the end, the remaining balance.

00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:42.190
But that's just the way the
amortizing fixed interest

00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:43.610
mortgage works.
 

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:47.614
And now we want to think about
how to value it,

00:58:47.614 --> 00:58:48.659
all right?
 

00:58:48.659 --> 00:58:53.652
So the payment is 8,
the coupon that they agreed on

00:58:53.652 --> 00:58:58.981
in the mortgage was 7 percent,
but that's different from what

00:58:58.981 --> 00:59:02.436
the interest rate is in the
whole economy which is 6

00:59:02.436 --> 00:59:03.518
percent, say.
 

00:59:03.518 --> 00:59:05.699
So suppose the interest rate is
6 percent.

00:59:05.699 --> 00:59:09.949
Why would it be that with a 6
percent interest rate today,

00:59:09.949 --> 00:59:13.309
one year interest rate today,
why would it be that if the

00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:15.530
interest rate was 6 percent
today--

00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:20.853
too complicated,
this tree--if the interest rate

00:59:20.853 --> 00:59:27.423
were 6 percent today why would
it be that the mortgage rate

00:59:27.423 --> 00:59:33.041
that people would agree to--
so it could be 6 percent--why

00:59:33.041 --> 00:59:36.679
is it that the mortgage rate
people could agree to--

00:59:36.679 --> 00:59:42.719
so this is 7.3 percent and this
went down to 4.9 percent.

00:59:42.719 --> 00:59:46.070
That's in that tree.
 

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:48.396
So you tell me,
why is it that when the

00:59:48.396 --> 00:59:50.599
interest rate is 6 percent
today--

00:59:50.599 --> 00:59:53.650
so everybody knows on average
it's going to stay around 6

00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:55.710
percent,
and here I want to get a loan

00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:58.833
from a bank to buy a house and I
put up my spectacular house as

00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:01.000
collateral so the bank should
feel safe.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.619
It's amortizing and all that.
 

01:00:02.619 --> 01:00:05.789
They should feel safe as long
as they haven't lent me too much

01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:06.570
money, right?
 

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:09.239
By the way, if my house is only
worth 80 dollars and they lend

01:00:09.239 --> 01:00:10.860
me 100 then the bank is in
trouble.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:14.228
If the house is worth 100 and
they lend me 100 the bank might

01:00:14.228 --> 01:00:17.539
be in some vulnerable situation
if the house loses value.

01:00:17.539 --> 01:00:19.860
So banks would have to be
stupid, as they were,

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.039
to make loans of the home value
almost equal to the house value,

01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:25.110
but we're going to come back to
that.

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:28.561
So suppose the house is worth
way more than the 100 they lend

01:00:28.561 --> 01:00:28.849
me.
 

01:00:28.849 --> 01:00:31.550
The amount I'm owing the bank
is only going down,

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:33.929
so the house is protecting the
bank completely,

01:00:33.929 --> 01:00:37.463
has no worries of me defaulting
because it'll just take my

01:00:37.463 --> 01:00:37.960
house.
 

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.289
Let's take that case.
 

01:00:40.289 --> 01:00:44.266
The interest rate in the
economy is 6 percent and here

01:00:44.266 --> 01:00:48.018
the bank is charging me 7
percent mortgage rate.

01:00:48.018 --> 01:00:50.219
That's what we agree on,
and of course when it charges

01:00:50.219 --> 01:00:52.626
me 7 percent mortgage rate I'm
going to be paying 8 dollars

01:00:52.626 --> 01:00:53.289
every month.
 

01:00:53.289 --> 01:00:55.360
How could that possibly be fair?
 

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.847
Or to put it another way,
why does the bank have to

01:00:58.847 --> 01:01:03.032
charge a mortgage rate that's
way above the starting interest

01:01:03.032 --> 01:01:03.659
rate?
 

01:01:03.659 --> 01:01:05.510
Why would it have to do that?
 

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:10.329
Why does it do it and why is
everyone willing to pay it?

01:01:10.329 --> 01:01:11.900
You see what the question is?
 

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.119
Back there, yes?
 

01:01:13.119 --> 01:01:15.320
Student: You have the
option of prepaying it.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:15.889
Prof: Right.
 

01:01:15.889 --> 01:01:19.465
I've got this really valuable
option, which of course the bank

01:01:19.465 --> 01:01:20.110
realizes.
 

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.530
I can always get out of it.
 

01:01:21.530 --> 01:01:24.150
I can pay the remaining balance
and get out of it.

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:28.132
Now, what am I hoping for when
I take my 7 percent mortgage out

01:01:28.132 --> 01:01:29.159
from the bank?
 

01:01:29.159 --> 01:01:30.800
What am I hoping for?
 

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.760
How am I going to make money,
the homeowner?

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.230
Yes?
 

01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:37.030
Student: If the interest
rate rises.

01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:39.182
Prof: Right,
so if there's some tremendous

01:01:39.182 --> 01:01:41.380
inflation like there might well
be now,

01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:43.730
some tremendous inflation in
the next 5 years--

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:45.159
this is a 30-year loan.
 

01:01:45.159 --> 01:01:48.331
If in the next 5 years the
economy's in so much trouble and

01:01:48.331 --> 01:01:51.612
we've got all these homeowners
under water and we owe so much

01:01:51.612 --> 01:01:54.838
money to the Chinese we could
well see the Fed engineering a

01:01:54.838 --> 01:01:57.518
gigantic inflation,
so the interest rate might go

01:01:57.518 --> 01:01:58.300
up to 10 percent.
 

01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:03.070
I'm continuing to borrow
effectively at 7 percent from

01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:04.059
the bank.
 

01:02:04.059 --> 01:02:05.179
How can you see that?
 

01:02:05.179 --> 01:02:06.789
Because this remaining balance,
remember,

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:09.500
the whole way it's structured
is, the payments,

01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:12.333
after a year,
the 100 I borrowed goes down to

01:02:12.333 --> 01:02:14.400
B_1,
but it's like a 20 [correction:

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.244
29]
year mortgage where I've

01:02:15.244 --> 01:02:17.719
borrowed B_1,
again, at 7 percent interest.

01:02:17.719 --> 01:02:20.896
After the third year,
right, just after making my

01:02:20.896 --> 01:02:25.068
payment the 27 years left of the
mortgage are treated explicitly

01:02:25.068 --> 01:02:29.306
by the law of the contract as if
I borrowed B_3 dollars

01:02:29.306 --> 01:02:31.159
at 7 percent interest.
 

01:02:31.159 --> 01:02:33.864
So in other words,
a mortgage is like a contract

01:02:33.864 --> 01:02:36.625
where every year I get to
re-borrow at 7 percent,

01:02:36.625 --> 01:02:39.559
but I'm borrowing a smaller and
smaller amount.

01:02:39.559 --> 01:02:41.719
So I perpetually get to borrow
at 7 percent,

01:02:41.719 --> 01:02:44.331
but I have the option of
canceling the whole thing by

01:02:44.331 --> 01:02:46.190
paying off the remaining
balance.

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:48.978
So I'm hoping that the interest
rate's going to go to 12 percent

01:02:48.978 --> 01:02:51.280
and I'm going to be borrowing
still at 7 percent,

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:53.940
borrowing at 7 percent and
reinvesting it at 12 percent.

01:02:53.940 --> 01:02:54.889
I'll make a killing.
 

01:02:54.889 --> 01:02:57.309
I'm praying for interest rates
to go up.

01:02:57.309 --> 01:02:59.541
Now, most homeowners think that
they're praying for interest

01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:01.130
rates to go down,
but they just have it all

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:01.659
backwards.
 

01:03:01.659 --> 01:03:04.271
They think if interest rates go
down they'll get a lower

01:03:04.271 --> 01:03:05.840
mortgage with a lower interest.
 

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.369
They don't realize that the
present value of their future

01:03:08.369 --> 01:03:09.768
payments, are going to go up.
 

01:03:09.768 --> 01:03:12.389
So they should be hoping for
the interest rates to go up.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:15.202
They should be hoping for a big
inflation and that's when

01:03:15.202 --> 01:03:16.710
they're going to make money.
 

01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:18.945
And the option that the
homeowner gains if interest

01:03:18.945 --> 01:03:21.360
rates go up and the homeowner
can always get out of the

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.134
mortgage and pay it off if the
interest rates go down by paying

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:28.090
off the remaining balance,
that's tremendously valuable.

01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:31.710
So how do we compute that value?
 

01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:35.179
We have to do it by backward
induction.

01:03:35.179 --> 01:03:38.518
You can intuitively see there's
some value, but you don't know

01:03:38.518 --> 01:03:41.750
exactly what it is until you do
it by backward induction.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:45.530
So here the payments are always
8.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:04:01.501
The payments we said were 8.05
and 8.05 and then at the end

01:04:01.501 --> 01:04:03.429
8.05.
 

01:04:03.429 --> 01:04:09.422
So we know that at the end the
present value of what the bank

01:04:09.422 --> 01:04:12.235
is going to owe,
the present value of how much

01:04:12.235 --> 01:04:13.500
the homeowner is going to have
to pay,

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.280
let's do it that way,
it going to be 0.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.519
So we know that at this point
the value that's left is 0

01:04:19.519 --> 01:04:22.936
because there are no payments
after this final--that's year

01:04:22.936 --> 01:04:23.349
30.
 

01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:24.789
There are no payments after
that.

01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:28.702
So assume that we've figured
out the value and we're working

01:04:28.702 --> 01:04:29.500
backwards.
 

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.639
So we are at some node like
this one where we know the

01:04:32.639 --> 01:04:35.956
interest rate and we want to
figure out what the value is

01:04:35.956 --> 01:04:38.739
here just after the coupon
payment is made.

01:04:38.739 --> 01:04:40.119
So what's the value?
 

01:04:40.119 --> 01:04:44.219
Well, the homeowner has the
option of making--remaining

01:04:44.219 --> 01:04:46.952
balance, remember,
was B_1,

01:04:46.952 --> 01:04:50.369
B_2 and this is
B_30.

01:04:50.369 --> 01:04:55.269
So at this node here this is 0,
this is times 0.

01:04:55.269 --> 01:04:58.599
So we have B_0 = 100.
 

01:04:58.599 --> 01:05:02.500
At time 1 the homeowner,
he's made the payment here,

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:07.836
so at time 1 he could just pay
B_1 and be out of the

01:05:07.836 --> 01:05:12.929
whole thing,
or he could make his payment.

01:05:12.929 --> 01:05:16.619
So if he makes his payment then
he owes the 8.05--

01:05:16.619 --> 01:05:19.567
sorry, he's just made his
payment, so he could either get

01:05:19.567 --> 01:05:22.199
out of the whole thing by paying
B_1,

01:05:22.199 --> 01:05:25.018
or he could wait to see what
happens next period.

01:05:25.018 --> 01:05:27.280
So half the time he's going to
go up,

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:31.092
so he's going to have to pay
8.05 and then he's going to have

01:05:31.092 --> 01:05:33.976
a decision then to make,
but we're working by backward

01:05:33.976 --> 01:05:34.420
induction.
 

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.992
We've already solved out for
what the value of his decision

01:05:36.992 --> 01:05:37.480
is there.
 

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:44.742
So it's V_Sup half
the time he's going to have to

01:05:44.742 --> 01:05:46.119
pay 8.05.
 

01:05:46.119 --> 01:05:49.329
He's going to be down here,
and then he's going to have the

01:05:49.329 --> 01:05:51.317
remaining--
he's going to have to decide

01:05:51.317 --> 01:05:53.579
whether to pay off the remaining
balance or not,

01:05:53.579 --> 01:05:56.329
and V_Sdown is that
decision,

01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:59.076
because we've already figured
out whether he should prepay or

01:05:59.076 --> 01:05:59.579
not here.
 

01:05:59.579 --> 01:06:01.079
So that's it.
 

01:06:01.079 --> 01:06:02.510
It couldn't be simpler.
 

01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:07.599
At every node after the coupon
payment is made the guy has the

01:06:07.599 --> 01:06:10.545
choice of paying or,
I mean, of prepaying,

01:06:10.545 --> 01:06:13.086
paying off the remaining
balance or waiting until the

01:06:13.086 --> 01:06:15.257
next period,
and then he has to pay the

01:06:15.257 --> 01:06:17.340
coupon if he waits until next
period,

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:23.199
and if he doesn't pay the
coupon then...

01:06:23.199 --> 01:06:24.309
Student: What happened
to the interest rate?

01:06:24.309 --> 01:06:25.382
Prof: Oh,
what happened to the interest

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:25.550
rate?
 

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:26.769
Well, I forgot it.
 

01:06:26.769 --> 01:06:28.230
So thank you.
 

01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:36.925
So I have to put this in
brackets and multiply by 1 over

01:06:36.925 --> 01:06:38.190
1.049.
 

01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:39.409
That's what happened to the
interest rate.

01:06:39.409 --> 01:06:40.650
I just forgot it.
 

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:43.659
So either he pays the remaining
balance or he waits,

01:06:43.659 --> 01:06:46.925
and of course he has to
discount it by the interest rate

01:06:46.925 --> 01:06:50.369
there which is 1 over 1.049
times 1 half times what happens

01:06:50.369 --> 01:06:53.340
over here 1 half times what
happens over here.

01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.914
And that's it,
and that's what I've written

01:06:55.914 --> 01:06:57.139
down in the nodes.
 

01:06:57.139 --> 01:07:01.161
So here are the interest rate
nodes and here are the present

01:07:01.161 --> 01:07:04.230
value--so here's the
non-callable mortgage.

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:08.224
So the non-callable mortgage,
if the homeowner was so stupid

01:07:08.224 --> 01:07:12.016
that he never prepaid and the
mortgage interest rate is 7

01:07:12.016 --> 01:07:15.739
percent and the interest rate
starts at 6 percent that's

01:07:15.739 --> 01:07:18.110
obviously great for the bank.
 

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:25.347
The guy's stupidly always going
to pay, never prepays,

01:07:25.347 --> 01:07:33.132
the bank makes 109 dollars,
but if the guy is much smarter

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:37.639
than that he's going to call.
 

01:07:37.639 --> 01:07:42.289
And now, lo and behold,
the value's only 95.55.

01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:47.902
The option is so valuable that
even though the interest rate is

01:07:47.902 --> 01:07:50.909
6 percent,
the mortgage rate is 7 percent,

01:07:50.909 --> 01:07:53.449
the banker's incredibly
overcharging him,

01:07:53.449 --> 01:08:00.056
and the guy will never default,
still the bank is getting a

01:08:00.056 --> 01:08:06.889
terrible deal because the
option's so valuable to the guy.

01:08:06.889 --> 01:08:09.079
So what is a bank going to do
in that case?

01:08:09.079 --> 01:08:14.760
What would a bank do?
 

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:17.640
I mean, if you were the banker
what would you do?

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.850
The interest rate is 6 percent.
 

01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:20.170
You can't control the interest
rates.

01:08:20.170 --> 01:08:21.319
That's the whole economy.
 

01:08:21.319 --> 01:08:23.469
Everybody's patience,
and impatience and all the

01:08:23.469 --> 01:08:25.161
Fisher stuff,
is determining all these

01:08:25.161 --> 01:08:26.029
interest rates.
 

01:08:26.029 --> 01:08:30.488
What would you do?
 

01:08:30.488 --> 01:08:33.109
You wouldn't charge 7 percent
as your mortgage rate.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.260
You'd have to charge a higher
mortgage rate.

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:38.342
Maybe you'd charge 8 percent,
and so we could just change the

01:08:38.342 --> 01:08:41.426
whole thing to 8 percent and
redo it, and you'll see that the

01:08:41.426 --> 01:08:42.609
guy will do better.
 

01:08:42.609 --> 01:08:49.576
So the mortgage rate,
let's put it as .075 instead of

01:08:49.576 --> 01:08:50.380
.07.
 

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.782
So now the annual payment's
gone up and everything is going

01:08:52.782 --> 01:08:53.279
to change.
 

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:56.550
And so the interest rate
process is the same.

01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:59.010
If the guy never prepays it's
now worth 114,

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:01.412
and if the guy does prepay
optimally, well,

01:09:01.412 --> 01:09:03.930
you still haven't gotten it
high enough.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:05.908
You have to make it 8 percent,
maybe.

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:12.126
So the interest rate looks like
it'll have to get to a lot above

01:09:12.126 --> 01:09:13.310
6 percent.
 

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:14.810
Maybe it'll have to go to 8
percent.

01:09:14.810 --> 01:09:16.828
Maybe 8 percent isn't enough.
 

01:09:16.828 --> 01:09:22.286
Well, on average--let's just
try .08 and now we can see how

01:09:22.286 --> 01:09:23.979
that worked out.
 

01:09:23.979 --> 01:09:25.670
Interest rate process is the
same.

01:09:25.670 --> 01:09:26.170
Look at this.
 

01:09:26.170 --> 01:09:28.250
If the guy never prepays it's
worth 120.

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:30.359
If he does prepay it's still
not enough.

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:32.310
So it's going to have to be 9
percent or something.

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:36.150
Now, typically if the interest
rate is 6 percent the mortgage

01:09:36.150 --> 01:09:39.479
rate will be something like 7
and 1 half percent,

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:42.840
not the 9 percent or 10 percent
I'd have to get up to.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:46.289
So why do you think that is?
 

01:09:46.289 --> 01:09:47.118
Yes?
 

01:09:47.118 --> 01:09:49.302
Student: Maybe there are
enough dumb people who don't

01:09:49.302 --> 01:09:51.079
prepay to make up for the smart
people who do?

01:09:51.079 --> 01:09:51.939
Prof: Exactly.
 

01:09:51.939 --> 01:09:54.850
You have to count on the dumb
people.

01:09:54.850 --> 01:09:58.050
That's an important fact of
life.

01:09:58.050 --> 01:10:00.479
You not only have to count on
them, you have to count them.

01:10:00.479 --> 01:10:04.753
So you have to figure out what
fraction of the population is

01:10:04.753 --> 01:10:08.448
this that's only going to pay
you 98 in the end,

01:10:08.448 --> 01:10:10.868
and what fraction of the
population is this,

01:10:10.868 --> 01:10:13.180
they're going to pay you 120 in
the end.

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:16.310
And if you knew which of the
guys were the 120 guys,

01:10:16.310 --> 01:10:23.462
what fraction were the 120 guys
and what fraction were the 98

01:10:23.462 --> 01:10:28.590
guys you'd know what the thing
was worth.

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:30.000
So how far am I going?
 

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.033
All right, so if you're a
mortgage hedge fund,

01:10:32.033 --> 01:10:33.750
my company is a mortgage hedge
fund.

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.590
That's what we started out with.
 

01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:39.510
We quickly did these
calculations and now--

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:43.170
all right, so if you look at
the data you're going to find--

01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:44.591
oh, by the way,
Sunday I'm having,

01:10:44.591 --> 01:10:46.472
remember,
this extra class Sunday night

01:10:46.472 --> 01:10:48.729
to tell you a little bit about
the real world,

01:10:48.729 --> 01:10:51.185
so I'm going to save the
stories of all the data and

01:10:51.185 --> 01:10:53.921
stuff until then,
but basically we look at how

01:10:53.921 --> 01:10:56.010
people have behaved in the past.
 

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:58.604
So were doing this tree and
we're figuring out,

01:10:58.604 --> 01:11:01.988
from this tree you can figure
out when the people should have

01:11:01.988 --> 01:11:03.060
prepaid or not.
 

01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:06.791
Actually the next tree,
if you have 1 dollar's worth of

01:11:06.791 --> 01:11:09.427
principal,
if you assume that the original

01:11:09.427 --> 01:11:12.905
principal was 1 dollar instead
of 100 and you always figure out

01:11:12.905 --> 01:11:16.046
at every node what would 1
dollar's worth of principal be

01:11:16.046 --> 01:11:19.510
there,
you can find out in an easy way

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:21.939
when people should prepay.
 

01:11:21.939 --> 01:11:25.376
So here you can see where all
the 1s are is when they should

01:11:25.376 --> 01:11:26.250
have prepaid.
 

01:11:26.250 --> 01:11:27.666
I don't have time now to
explain that,

01:11:27.666 --> 01:11:29.734
but anyway just a slight
modification of the tree shows

01:11:29.734 --> 01:11:30.960
you when they should prepay.
 

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:33.698
So you can look at when people
should prepay and you can look

01:11:33.698 --> 01:11:35.979
in the data at how many of the
people do prepay.

01:11:35.979 --> 01:11:37.810
So you can go house by house.
 

01:11:37.810 --> 01:11:39.609
It's public information.
 

01:11:39.609 --> 01:11:42.159
Are these people prepaying or
aren't they prepaying?

01:11:42.159 --> 01:11:43.600
How smart are they?
 

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.981
And you can deduce from having
watched them in the past miss

01:11:46.981 --> 01:11:50.305
opportunity after opportunity to
prepay you know that these

01:11:50.305 --> 01:11:51.948
guys--
now, it's not a matter of being

01:11:51.948 --> 01:11:53.278
stupid,
in fact the smartest people

01:11:53.278 --> 01:11:56.260
might be the ones not prepaying,
they're not paying attention or

01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.729
maybe it's a real hassle for
them to prepay.

01:11:58.729 --> 01:12:00.750
So we're going to come to the
reasons why they won't prepay.

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:03.587
So you have to calibrate how
many people are behaving

01:12:03.587 --> 01:12:05.770
optimally and how many people
aren't,

01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:08.412
and then you can judge how high
you have to set the interest

01:12:08.412 --> 01:12:09.979
rate to make a reasonable
profit.

01:12:09.979 --> 01:12:13.100
And I'm going to talk more
about that next time.

01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:18.000

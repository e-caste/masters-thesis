00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.000
Professor Shelly Kagan:
We've been looking at Plato's

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.195
arguments for the immortality of
the soul, and so far I have to

00:00:07.195 --> 00:00:10.030
say I haven't found them very
compelling arguments.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.318
In a minute,
I'm going to turn to an

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:13.380
argument that at least strikes
me as more interesting.

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.490
It's more difficult to pin down
where it goes wrong.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.330
But before we do,
I want to make a last couple of

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.882
comments about the argument we
were considering at the end of

00:00:22.882 --> 00:00:25.063
last class.
That was the argument from

00:00:25.063 --> 00:00:27.862
recollection.
You recall the basic idea was

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:31.850
that although objects in the
ordinary familiar empirical

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.458
world are not perfectly just,
perfectly round,

00:00:35.458 --> 00:00:38.840
what have you,
they're able to remind us of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.120
perfect justice,
perfect roundness and the like.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.640
And when Plato asked himself,
"How could that be?"

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.710
the answer he gives is,
"Well, it's got to be that we

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.195
were previously acquainted with
the forms before our life in

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:55.308
this world."
And that shows that the soul

00:00:55.308 --> 00:00:59.800
must be something that existed
prior to the creation of the

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.342
body.
That's the argument from

00:01:01.342 --> 00:01:03.992
recollection.
And at the very end of class I

00:01:03.992 --> 00:01:07.160
suggested that,
look, even if we were to grant

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.610
to Plato that in order to think
about justice,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.510
circularity,
what have you,

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.603
we had to somehow grasp the
forms, and even if we were to

00:01:16.603 --> 00:01:21.135
grant to Plato that nothing in
this world is perfectly round or

00:01:21.135 --> 00:01:25.069
perfectly just,
it's not necessarily correct to

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:29.405
say, "So the only possible
explanation of what's going on

00:01:29.405 --> 00:01:33.973
is that these things in the
empirical world remind us of our

00:01:33.973 --> 00:01:37.069
prior acquaintance with the
forms."

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:41.563
It could be that what goes on
is, when we bump up against

00:01:41.563 --> 00:01:46.056
something that's partially just
or partially beautiful or

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:50.550
partially round--imperfectly
round--what happens is,

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.399
those things sort of trigger
our minds in such a way that we

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.049
begin to think about the forms
for the very first time.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.482
So it might be,
in order to think about justice

00:02:04.482 --> 00:02:06.810
and roundness,
we have to grasp the forms.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.640
But it could be that we only
grasp the forms in this life,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.833
for the very first time.
Exposure to the things that

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:23.370
participate in the forms may
nudge our minds or our souls in

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.344
such a way that at that
point--given that exposure--we

00:02:28.344 --> 00:02:33.684
begin to grasp the forms.
It's as though the ordinary

00:02:33.684 --> 00:02:37.986
earthly objects,
we bump into them or they bump

00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:43.971
into us, and they get us to look
upwards to the heavenly Platonic

00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:46.120
realm.
I don't mean literally upwards.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.743
It's not as though these
things--the number three--is up

00:02:49.743 --> 00:02:52.845
there.
But if you accept the metaphor,

00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:57.497
running into things in the
empirical world gets our minds

00:02:57.497 --> 00:03:01.567
to start thinking about,
for the first time,

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:06.569
the heavenly realm of the
Platonic forms and ideas.

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.533
That would be just as likely a
possibility as the alternative

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:16.330
explanation that what's going on
is that ordinary empirical

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.879
objects are reminding us of our
prior acquaintance.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:24.720
Perhaps these ordinary objects
act like letters of

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.836
introduction,
getting us to,

00:03:26.836 --> 00:03:30.205
helping us to,
think about the forms for the

00:03:30.205 --> 00:03:33.445
very first time.
Well, if that's right,

00:03:33.445 --> 00:03:36.475
then of course,
we don't have any good reason

00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:40.626
to follow Plato when he says,
"It must be the case that the

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:43.580
soul existed prior to the--prior
to birth."

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.899
Now, the objection I've just
raised is not an objection that

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:52.935
Plato raises in the
Phaedo,

00:03:52.935 --> 00:03:55.650
but he does raise a different
objection.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.686
Remember our concern isn't,
strictly speaking,

00:03:58.686 --> 00:04:01.925
with the question,
"Did the soul exist before our

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:04.050
birth?
Did the soul exist before our

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.228
bodies?"
but rather, "Is the soul

00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:09.061
immortal?"
And so, having now given the

00:04:09.061 --> 00:04:12.633
argument from recollection,
Plato envisions two of

00:04:12.633 --> 00:04:15.895
Socrates' disciples,
Simmias and Cebes,

00:04:15.895 --> 00:04:19.329
responding, objecting,
by saying, "Look,

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.939
even if the soul existed before
birth,

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:26.649
it doesn't follow that it
exists after death.

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:28.356
And that's, after all,
what we really want,

00:04:28.356 --> 00:04:30.217
are wondering about.
We want to know,

00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:33.370
will we survive our deaths?
Is the soul immortal?

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.410
And you haven't yet shown that
Socrates," they object.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.331
Could be that it existed
before, but won't exist

00:04:40.331 --> 00:04:42.790
afterwards.
But very nicely--it's quite

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.090
elegant structure at this
point--Socrates puts together

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.330
the two arguments that we've
just been rehearsing--the

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.936
argument from recollection and
the argument that came before

00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:55.125
that,
the one that I dubbed "the

00:04:55.125 --> 00:04:58.174
argument from recycling."
Remember, the argument from

00:04:58.174 --> 00:05:00.537
recycling says,
when you build something,

00:05:00.537 --> 00:05:05.262
you build it out of parts,
and when that thing falls apart

00:05:05.262 --> 00:05:08.240
you go back to the parts.
All right.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.297
So the prior parts get recycled.
The soul, we now say--based on

00:05:16.297 --> 00:05:20.932
the argument from
recollection--the soul is one of

00:05:20.932 --> 00:05:24.433
our prior parts.
The soul existed before we were

00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:26.796
put together,
or before we were put together

00:05:26.796 --> 00:05:29.218
with our bodies.
If you then combine the

00:05:29.218 --> 00:05:32.872
argument from recycling and say,
the parts that existed before

00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:37.643
are going to exist afterwards,
it must follow that if the soul

00:05:37.643 --> 00:05:41.429
existed before,
it will exist afterwards as

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:43.720
well.
And so we've got the

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.470
immortality of the soul after
all.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.352
Now, bracket the fact that,
as I just explained,

00:05:50.352 --> 00:05:54.400
I don't myself find the
argument from recollection

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.265
persuasive.
I don't think we've got any

00:05:57.265 --> 00:06:01.117
good reason to believe--based on
the sort of things that Plato is

00:06:01.117 --> 00:06:04.547
drawing our attention to--I
don't think we've got any good

00:06:04.547 --> 00:06:08.459
reason to believe that the soul
existed before we were born.

00:06:08.459 --> 00:06:13.305
But even if we grant him that,
we shouldn't be so quick to

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:17.725
conclude, on the basis of
combining the argument from

00:06:17.725 --> 00:06:21.889
recollection and the argument
from recycling,

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.677
that the soul will continue to
exist after the death of our

00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:29.364
bodies.
After all, take a more

00:06:29.364 --> 00:06:36.008
familiar, humdrum example.
Cars are built out of non-cars,

00:06:36.008 --> 00:06:38.932
right?
Cars get built out of engines

00:06:38.932 --> 00:06:43.630
and tires and steering wheels.
And the engine is not a car;

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:49.759
the steering wheel is not a car.
So you build the car out of its

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:52.411
parts.
Now, the engine is a

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:56.430
prior-existing part.
So can we conclude then that

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:59.488
from the fact that--argument
from recycling:

00:06:59.488 --> 00:07:01.645
parts get reused,
get rebuilt,

00:07:01.645 --> 00:07:05.017
when cars get destroyed,
the parts are still around--can

00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:08.758
we conclude from the argument
from recycling and the fact that

00:07:08.758 --> 00:07:12.252
the engine is a prior-existing
part from which the car was

00:07:12.252 --> 00:07:15.946
built,
that the engine will continue

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:21.040
to exist forever after the
destruction of the car?

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.279
No, obviously you can't
conclude that at all.

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:27.173
Sometimes when cars get
destroyed the engine gets

00:07:27.173 --> 00:07:31.054
destroyed right along with it.
And of course,

00:07:31.054 --> 00:07:36.376
even if--in many cases--the
engine continues to exist for a

00:07:36.376 --> 00:07:40.230
while after the destruction of
the car,

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.920
it certainly doesn't follow
that the engine is immortal,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.730
that it continues to exist
forever.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.812
Engines will eventually
decompose and turn back into

00:07:49.812 --> 00:07:53.348
atoms.
So from the mere fact that the

00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:58.370
engine was a part that existed
before the car existed,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:01.546
and the further fact that when
the car breaks down,

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:05.341
it decomposes back into parts,
it certainly doesn't follow

00:08:05.341 --> 00:08:08.995
that all of the parts that
existed prior to the existence

00:08:08.995 --> 00:08:11.410
of the car will be around
forever.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:16.741
That would just be false.
So even if we were to give

00:08:16.741 --> 00:08:21.873
Socrates the assumption
that--the thesis that--the soul

00:08:21.873 --> 00:08:25.579
existed before we were put
together,

00:08:25.579 --> 00:08:30.116
before we were born,
it still wouldn't follow that

00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:35.950
the soul will continue to exist
after we're taken back apart.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:42.274
The soul might eventually decay
just like the engine will

00:08:42.274 --> 00:08:45.461
eventually decay.
What we need,

00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:50.027
to really become convinced of
the immortality of the soul,

00:08:50.027 --> 00:08:54.338
is not the mere suggestion,
even it was--even if we were

00:08:54.338 --> 00:08:58.019
convinced--is not the mere
suggestion that the soul was

00:08:58.019 --> 00:09:03.432
around before our birth.
We need to believe that the

00:09:03.432 --> 00:09:09.917
soul, unlike an engine,
can't itself be destroyed,

00:09:09.917 --> 00:09:15.740
can't itself decompose,
can't fall apart.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.914
That's what we need if we're
really going to become convinced

00:09:19.914 --> 00:09:24.014
of the immortality of the soul.
Now, as I remarked previously,

00:09:24.014 --> 00:09:27.562
one of the amazing things--not
amazing but one of the really

00:09:27.562 --> 00:09:30.450
attractive things about Plato's
dialogues is,

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:34.867
you raise an objection and it
often seems as though Plato

00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:39.679
himself, whether or not he
explicitly states the objection,

00:09:39.679 --> 00:09:43.822
seems aware of the objection,
because he'll go on to say

00:09:43.822 --> 00:09:46.610
something that is responsive to
it.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:50.251
And again, that makes sense if
you think of these dialogues as

00:09:50.251 --> 00:09:53.295
a kind of pedagogical tool to
help you get better at

00:09:53.295 --> 00:09:56.629
philosophizing.
So the very next argument that

00:09:56.629 --> 00:10:00.956
Plato turns to can be viewed,
I think, as responding to this

00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:03.680
unstated objection--well,
I stated it,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.867
but Plato doesn't state it in
the dialogue--the worry that

00:10:06.867 --> 00:10:09.159
even if the soul was one of the
parts,

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:12.663
even if the soul was already
around before we were born,

00:10:12.663 --> 00:10:15.019
how do we know it can't come
apart?

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:17.960
How do we know the soul can't
be destroyed?

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.846
Since what we want to know is
whether the soul is immortal,

00:10:21.846 --> 00:10:26.057
how do we know it can't break?
Plato's next argument then

00:10:26.057 --> 00:10:30.431
tries to deal directly with this
worry, and it's a quite

00:10:30.431 --> 00:10:34.640
interesting argument.
I'll give it another--a new

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:39.070
label--I'll call it the
"argument from simplicity."

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:46.004
Socrates turns to a discussion
of what kinds of things can

00:10:46.004 --> 00:10:51.480
break and what kinds of things
can't break;

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.157
what kinds of things can be
destroyed, and what kinds of

00:10:54.157 --> 00:10:57.549
things can't be destroyed.
He thinks about examples;

00:10:57.549 --> 00:11:00.822
he surveys examples and tries
to extract a kind of

00:11:00.822 --> 00:11:03.159
metaphysical principle from
this.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:05.246
And then, as we'll see,
he's going to use this

00:11:05.246 --> 00:11:07.982
principle to convince us--or to
try to convince us--that the

00:11:07.982 --> 00:11:09.929
soul is immortal,
it's indestructible.

00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:14.280
Well, lots of things can be
destroyed.

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.290
Here's a piece of paper.
It can be destroyed Right?

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:26.394
Why was it that this was the
sort of thing that could be

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:28.823
destroyed?
Well, the straightforward

00:11:28.823 --> 00:11:31.820
answer is the piece of paper had
parts.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.445
And in breaking it,
in ripping it,

00:11:34.445 --> 00:11:39.059
what I literally did was I
ripped one part from another.

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:43.720
To destroy the piece of paper,
I take its parts apart.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:55.451
Here's piece of chalk.
The piece of chalk can be

00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:57.650
broken.
What am I doing?

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:04.072
Taking its parts apart.
The kinds of things that can be

00:12:04.072 --> 00:12:09.340
destroyed have parts.
They are composite.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.149
They are composed of their
parts.

00:12:13.149 --> 00:12:19.593
Bodies can be destroyed because
you can take a sword to it and

00:12:19.593 --> 00:12:24.769
go sweep, sweep,
sweep and chop it into pieces.

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:28.039
Composite things can be
destroyed.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:31.129
Things that have parts can be
destroyed.

00:12:31.129 --> 00:12:34.200
Now, what kind of things can't
be destroyed?

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.676
Well, it won't surprise you
that when Plato looks for an

00:12:37.676 --> 00:12:41.279
example of something that's
eternal and indestructible,

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:45.251
his mind immediately starts
thinking about the Platonic

00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:48.840
forms.
Take the number three.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:53.470
The number three can't be
destroyed, right?

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:58.645
Even if nuclear explosion took
place and everything on Earth

00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:03.381
got atomized and destroyed
through some bizarre science

00:13:03.381 --> 00:13:07.940
fiction chain reaction,
like they're always doing in

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:11.539
movies, the number three
wouldn't be touched.

00:13:11.539 --> 00:13:13.320
The number three wouldn't be
fazed.

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:17.920
It would still be true that
three plus one equals four.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:26.123
You can't hurt the number three.
You can't alter or destroy

00:13:26.123 --> 00:13:30.660
perfect circularity.
Why not?

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:36.659
Well, it doesn't have any parts.
That's the thought.

00:13:36.659 --> 00:13:42.514
Things like the Platonic forms
are eternal, and they're

00:13:42.514 --> 00:13:46.383
eternal, changeless,
and indestructible,

00:13:46.383 --> 00:13:50.912
because they are simple--simple
here being the metaphysical

00:13:50.912 --> 00:13:54.659
notion that they're not composed
of anything.

00:13:54.659 --> 00:13:57.580
Anything that's built up out of
parts you could,

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.687
at least in principle,
worry about the parts coming

00:14:00.687 --> 00:14:03.669
apart and, hence,
the thing being destroyed.

00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:09.080
But anything that's simple
can't be destroyed in that way.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.660
It has no parts to take apart.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.831
So the kinds of things that can
be destroyed are the things with

00:14:19.831 --> 00:14:23.654
parts, and those are the sorts
of things that change,

00:14:23.654 --> 00:14:26.182
right?
Even if they're not destroyed,

00:14:26.182 --> 00:14:28.990
what's a tip off to something
being composite?

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:32.745
The fact that it changes.
Suppose I take a bar of metal

00:14:32.745 --> 00:14:35.208
and I bend it.
I haven't destroyed it,

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:38.308
but I've changed it.
I'm able to change it by

00:14:38.308 --> 00:14:42.769
rearranging the relationships
between the various parts.

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:46.679
My body is constantly changing
because the relationships

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:51.370
between my arms and my head and
so forth, my muscles are moving.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.570
You rearrange the parts,
the thing changes.

00:14:53.570 --> 00:14:55.830
Oh, but that means it's got
parts and could be destroyed.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.870
So we've got some nice
generalizations.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:05.917
Things that change have parts;
things with parts can be

00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:08.879
destroyed.
What are the kinds of things

00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:13.389
that you can change and destroy?
Those are the familiar

00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:17.639
empirical objects that we can
see: pieces of paper,

00:15:17.639 --> 00:15:21.210
bodies, pieces of chalk,
bars of metal.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:24.252
In contrast,
on the whole other side,

00:15:24.252 --> 00:15:28.647
you've got things that are
invisible, like the number

00:15:28.647 --> 00:15:32.957
three--nobody sees the number
three--things that are

00:15:32.957 --> 00:15:35.639
invisible,
that never change.

00:15:35.639 --> 00:15:38.620
The number three never changes,
right?

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:41.950
The number three is an odd
number.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.985
It's not as though,
oh, today it's odd but maybe

00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:49.490
tomorrow it'll be even.
It's eternally an odd number.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.789
Three plus one equals four
today, yesterday and forever.

00:15:54.789 --> 00:15:57.450
These facts about the number
three will never change.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:16:02.820
The number three is changeless.
So the forms are eternal;

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.539
they're invisible;
they are changeless.

00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:09.030
They're simple,
and simple things can't be

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.000
destroyed;
forms can't be destroyed.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.573
You put all this together;
these are the sorts of thoughts

00:16:15.573 --> 00:16:19.341
that Socrates assembles,
and I've got the initial

00:16:19.341 --> 00:16:24.019
thoughts up there on the board.
All right.

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:28.737
So premise number one,
only composite things can be

00:16:28.737 --> 00:16:32.529
destroyed.
Premise number two,

00:16:32.529 --> 00:16:37.570
only changing things are
composite.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.642
So if you put one and two
together, you'd get:

00:16:40.642 --> 00:16:43.509
only changing things could be
destroyed.

00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:49.950
And now add three,
invisible things don't change.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:52.238
Well, if you've got to be the
kind of thing that can change in

00:16:52.238 --> 00:16:54.602
order to be composite and you've
got to be composite in order to

00:16:54.602 --> 00:16:57.810
be destroyed,
invisible things don't change,

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:01.066
follows four,
invisible things can't be

00:17:01.066 --> 00:17:05.310
destroyed.
That's the metaphysical thesis

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:10.319
that Socrates comes to by
thinking about cases.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:14.866
And that's the crucial premise
or sub-conclusion for the

00:17:14.866 --> 00:17:19.247
immortality of the soul,
because then Socrates invites

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:24.563
us to think about the soul.
Is the soul visible or

00:17:24.563 --> 00:17:28.930
invisible?
He says, pretty obviously,

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:32.945
"it's invisible."
But if invisible things can't

00:17:32.945 --> 00:17:35.829
be destroyed,
the soul can't be destroyed.

00:17:35.829 --> 00:17:41.928
So one, two and three got us
four, invisible things can't be

00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:46.992
destroyed, but five,
the soul is invisible so six,

00:17:46.992 --> 00:17:52.303
the soul can't be destroyed.
That's my best attempt at

00:17:52.303 --> 00:17:55.910
reconstructing the argument from
simplicity.

00:17:55.910 --> 00:17:58.737
It's not as though Plato
himself spells it out with

00:17:58.737 --> 00:18:00.829
premises and conclusions like
that,

00:18:00.829 --> 00:18:05.946
but I think this is fairly
faithful to the kind of argument

00:18:05.946 --> 00:18:09.912
he means to put forward.
And in a moment I'll turn to

00:18:09.912 --> 00:18:12.900
evaluating whether that's a good
argument or not.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.279
But I think it's a pretty
interesting argument;

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:19.019
it's an argument worth taking
fairly seriously.

00:18:19.019 --> 00:18:23.365
Except, I've got to confess to
you that Socrates doesn't quite

00:18:23.365 --> 00:18:27.640
conclude the way I would've
thought he would've concluded.

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:30.218
So I've had the argument
conclude six,

00:18:30.218 --> 00:18:35.471
the soul can't be destroyed.
But what Socrates actually says

00:18:35.471 --> 00:18:40.366
is--his actual conclusion
is--"And so the soul is

00:18:40.366 --> 00:18:46.053
indestructible or nearly so."
That's rather an odd

00:18:46.053 --> 00:18:49.809
qualification,
"or nearly so."

00:18:49.809 --> 00:18:53.049
The conclusion that Socrates
reaches from his examination of

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:55.740
change and invisibility and so
forth and so on,

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:59.660
and compositeness versus
simplicity, is that "the soul is

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:05.351
indestructible or nearly so."
Now, adding that qualification

00:19:05.351 --> 00:19:11.467
opens the door to a worry.
The worry gets raised by Cebes

00:19:11.467 --> 00:19:16.281
who says, even if we grant that
the soul is nearly

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:20.604
indestructible,
that's not good enough to get

00:19:20.604 --> 00:19:25.042
us immortality.
And he gives a very nice

00:19:25.042 --> 00:19:30.915
analogy of somebody who's--a
coat, which could outlast the

00:19:30.915 --> 00:19:35.744
owner but isn't immortal.
Or the owner could go through

00:19:35.744 --> 00:19:39.033
several coats;
but still at some point the

00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:44.045
owner's going to die as well.
The owner is far more immortal,

00:19:44.045 --> 00:19:47.079
in that sense,
closer to immortality.

00:19:47.079 --> 00:19:50.224
And I've gone through many
coats in my life,

00:19:50.224 --> 00:19:53.369
but for all that,
I'm not indestructible.

00:19:53.369 --> 00:19:57.386
If all we've got is the mere
fact that the soul is "nearly"

00:19:57.386 --> 00:20:00.503
indestructible,
it takes a whole lot more work

00:20:00.503 --> 00:20:03.371
to destroy it,
maybe it lasts a whole lot

00:20:03.371 --> 00:20:05.779
longer;
maybe it goes through a whole

00:20:05.779 --> 00:20:08.743
lot of bodies being reincarnated
a half-dozen,

00:20:08.743 --> 00:20:12.432
or a dozen, or hundred times
before it wears out and gets

00:20:12.432 --> 00:20:14.431
destroyed.
That's not enough to give us

00:20:14.431 --> 00:20:15.480
the immortality of the soul.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:20.750
That's the objection that Cebes
raises.

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:26.361
And one of the oddities is
that, as far as I can see,

00:20:26.361 --> 00:20:31.109
Socrates never responds to that
objection.

00:20:31.109 --> 00:20:35.281
Raises the objection--that is,
Plato raises the objection in

00:20:35.281 --> 00:20:38.887
the voice of Cebes--but
Socrates, on Plato's behalf,

00:20:38.887 --> 00:20:42.620
never answers the objection.
It's hard to say what exactly

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:44.678
is going on.
It might be that Plato's

00:20:44.678 --> 00:20:48.174
worried that he hasn't really
shown that the soul is immortal

00:20:48.174 --> 00:20:50.436
afterwards.
Maybe this argument from

00:20:50.436 --> 00:20:53.509
simplicity isn't really as good
as it needs to be.

00:20:53.509 --> 00:20:58.195
And maybe that explains why
Plato then goes on to offer yet

00:20:58.195 --> 00:21:01.036
another argument.
After all, if this argument

00:21:01.036 --> 00:21:03.987
really did show the immortality
of the soul, why would he need

00:21:03.987 --> 00:21:06.212
to offer a further
argument?--The argument from

00:21:06.212 --> 00:21:10.039
essential properties,
which we'll be turning to later.

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:14.930
So maybe Plato just thought
there wasn't a good answer to

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.205
Cebes' objection.
But I want to say,

00:21:18.205 --> 00:21:22.333
on Plato's behalf,
or at least on behalf of the

00:21:22.333 --> 00:21:25.866
argument,
Socrates should never have

00:21:25.866 --> 00:21:31.725
concluded the argument with this
odd qualifying phrase that the

00:21:31.725 --> 00:21:35.599
soul is "indestructible or
nearly so."

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:40.556
He should've just said the soul
is indestructible,

00:21:40.556 --> 00:21:44.364
full stop.
After all, if we have premises

00:21:44.364 --> 00:21:48.515
one, two, and three--only
composite things can be

00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:51.389
destroyed,
only changing things are

00:21:51.389 --> 00:21:55.545
composite, invisible things
don't change--if you put those

00:21:55.545 --> 00:21:57.639
together,
you get four,

00:21:57.639 --> 00:22:01.109
invisible things can't be
destroyed.

00:22:01.109 --> 00:22:05.184
You don't get the more modest
conclusion, "invisible things

00:22:05.184 --> 00:22:09.047
can't be destroyed or it's a
whole lot harder to destroy

00:22:09.047 --> 00:22:10.965
them."
If we've got one,

00:22:10.965 --> 00:22:13.826
two and three,
we're entitled to the bold

00:22:13.826 --> 00:22:17.260
conclusion: "invisible things
can't be destroyed,

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.529
period."
Full stop.

00:22:20.529 --> 00:22:23.801
And then if five is true,
if the soul really is

00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:26.930
invisible, we're entitled to
conclude six,

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.305
the soul can't be
destroyed--not,

00:22:29.305 --> 00:22:33.611
the soul can't be destroyed,
or if it can be destroyed it's

00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:36.370
very,
very hard and takes a very,

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.377
very long time.
We are, rather,

00:22:39.377 --> 00:22:45.388
entitled to the bolder
conclusion, the soul can't be

00:22:45.388 --> 00:22:51.869
destroyed, full stop,
period, end of the discussion.

00:22:51.869 --> 00:22:55.365
So despite the fact that
Socrates draws this weaker

00:22:55.365 --> 00:22:59.769
conclusion, it seems to me that
the argument he's offered us,

00:22:59.769 --> 00:23:05.207
if it works at all,
entitles us to draw the bolder

00:23:05.207 --> 00:23:07.559
conclusion.
Not that the soul is

00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:09.741
indestructible or nearly so,
but that the soul is

00:23:09.741 --> 00:23:10.560
indestructible.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:18.615
Well, maybe Plato realized that;
maybe that's the reason why he

00:23:18.615 --> 00:23:21.099
doesn't bother giving an answer
to Cebes.

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:27.612
Maybe it's an invitation to the
reader to recognize that there's

00:23:27.612 --> 00:23:34.228
a better argument here than even
the characters in the drama have

00:23:34.228 --> 00:23:39.534
noticed--don't know,
don't know what Plato had in

00:23:39.534 --> 00:23:41.346
mind.
But at any rate,

00:23:41.346 --> 00:23:45.420
our question shouldn't be,
"What was Plato thinking?"

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:51.918
but, "Is the argument any good?"
Do we now have an argument for

00:23:51.918 --> 00:23:55.712
the immortality of the soul?
After all, if the soul can't be

00:23:55.712 --> 00:24:02.390
destroyed, it's immortal.
Is it a good argument or not?

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:06.539
Simmias raises a different
objection.

00:24:06.539 --> 00:24:11.741
Simmias says we can't conclude
that the soul is indestructible,

00:24:11.741 --> 00:24:14.436
or nearly so,
or whatever,

00:24:14.436 --> 00:24:20.781
because we should not believe
the sub-conclusion four,

00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:25.450
invisible things can't be
destroyed.

00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:33.539
Simmias says invisible things
can be destroyed.

00:24:33.539 --> 00:24:36.549
And if that's true,
then of course we no longer

00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:39.755
have an argument for the
indestructibility or near

00:24:39.755 --> 00:24:44.091
indestructibility of the soul.
Because even if the soul is

00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:46.515
invisible, five,
if nonetheless,

00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:49.799
contrary to what Socrates was
claiming,

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:53.378
invisible things can be
destroyed, then maybe the

00:24:53.378 --> 00:24:56.509
invisible soul can be destroyed
as well.

00:24:56.509 --> 00:24:59.046
Now, Simmias doesn't merely
assert, boldly,

00:24:59.046 --> 00:25:01.220
invisible things can be
destroyed.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:09.012
He offers an example of an
invisible thing that can be

00:25:09.012 --> 00:25:13.959
destroyed--harmony.
He starts talking about the

00:25:13.959 --> 00:25:17.610
harmony that gets produced by a
stringed instrument;

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:21.710
let's say a harp.
In fact, he says,

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:26.806
this is a very nice example for
us to think about because some

00:25:26.806 --> 00:25:31.986
people have suggested--Simmias
says--some people have suggested

00:25:31.986 --> 00:25:37.258
that the mind is like harmony.
It's as though the mind is like

00:25:37.258 --> 00:25:41.824
harmony of the body.
So to spell out the analogy a

00:25:41.824 --> 00:25:46.337
bit more fully,
and I'll say a bit more about

00:25:46.337 --> 00:25:52.800
it later, harmony is to the harp
as the mind is to the body.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.986
All right.
He says, there are people who

00:25:55.986 --> 00:26:00.911
put forward views like this,
and at any rate harmony can

00:26:00.911 --> 00:26:05.130
certainly be destroyed.
You don't see harmony, right?

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:09.250
Harmony is invisible.
But for all that,

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.945
you can destroy harmony.
So there's the harp making its

00:26:12.945 --> 00:26:17.695
melodious, harmonious sounds,
and then you take an ax to the

00:26:17.695 --> 00:26:19.408
harp,
bang, bang, bang,

00:26:19.408 --> 00:26:22.109
chop, chop, chop,
or a hammer or whatever;

00:26:22.109 --> 00:26:25.009
now the harmony's been
destroyed.

00:26:25.009 --> 00:26:30.619
So even though it's invisible,
you can destroy it by

00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:36.779
destroying the musical
instrument on which it depends.

00:26:36.779 --> 00:26:38.708
And of course,
there's the worry,

00:26:38.708 --> 00:26:41.425
right?
If the mind is like the harmony

00:26:41.425 --> 00:26:45.029
of the body, then maybe you
could destroy the mind,

00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:49.500
the soul, by destroying the
body on which the mind depends.

00:26:54.019 --> 00:26:58.939
So the crucial point right now
is that thinking about harmony

00:26:58.939 --> 00:27:03.530
is offered as a counterexample
to the generalization that

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:06.810
invisible things can't be
destroyed.

00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:10.440
Harmony is invisible.
Harmony can be destroyed.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:13.759
So invisible things can be
destroyed.

00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:15.565
So you're wrong,
Socrates, when you say

00:27:15.565 --> 00:27:17.369
invisible things can't be
destroyed.

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:19.660
So even if we grant that the
soul is invisible as well,

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:21.866
maybe the soul also is an
invisible thing that can be

00:27:21.866 --> 00:27:22.460
destroyed.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:33.189
That's a great objection.
It's an objection worth taking

00:27:33.189 --> 00:27:37.614
very seriously.
And the oddity is,

00:27:37.614 --> 00:27:44.951
Socrates doesn't respond to it
in the way that he should have,

00:27:44.951 --> 00:27:52.631
in the way that he needed to.
Socrates instead spends some

00:27:52.631 --> 00:27:59.746
time worrying about the
question, "Is the soul really

00:27:59.746 --> 00:28:05.617
like harmony or not?"
Is this metaphor--think about

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:10.882
the relationship between the
mind and body as similar to the

00:28:10.882 --> 00:28:16.236
relationship between harmony and
a harp--Socrates spends some

00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:19.360
time criticizing that analogy.

00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:28.555
Now, in a few minutes I'll turn
to the question,

00:28:28.555 --> 00:28:34.410
what about Socrates' criticisms
of the analogy?

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.170
Are they good criticisms or not?

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:44.263
But even if they are good
criticisms, I want to say,

00:28:44.263 --> 00:28:48.769
that's not good enough to help
your argument Socrates.

00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:51.890
Even if we were to say,
you know what?

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:55.470
The mind isn't very much like
harmony at all.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:29:01.329
That analogy really stinks.
So what?

00:29:01.329 --> 00:29:06.952
All that Simmias needs to cause
problems for Socrates' argument

00:29:06.952 --> 00:29:12.030
is the claim that harmony is
invisible and harmony can be

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.598
destroyed.
As long as that is true,

00:29:15.598 --> 00:29:21.154
we can't continue to believe
that invisible things can't be

00:29:21.154 --> 00:29:24.858
destroyed.
So what Socrates needs to do is

00:29:24.858 --> 00:29:29.696
to say either harmony can't be
destroyed, but pretty obviously

00:29:29.696 --> 00:29:32.927
it can,
the melodious sounds coming out

00:29:32.927 --> 00:29:35.680
of an instrument can be
destroyed.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:39.908
So he would need to argue then,
perhaps, that harmony is not

00:29:39.908 --> 00:29:42.383
really invisible.
If he could show us,

00:29:42.383 --> 00:29:45.166
if he could convince us,
that harmony is not really

00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:47.634
invisible,
then we would no longer have a

00:29:47.634 --> 00:29:50.774
counterexample to the claim that
the invisible can't be

00:29:50.774 --> 00:29:53.732
destroyed,
and the argument could still

00:29:53.732 --> 00:29:58.365
then proceed as it was before.
So that's what Socrates should

00:29:58.365 --> 00:30:00.858
have done.
He should have said,

00:30:00.858 --> 00:30:03.907
"You know what?
Harmony is not really

00:30:03.907 --> 00:30:07.140
invisible," or "It can't be
destroyed."

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.123
But there's not a whiff of
that, at least in the dialogue

00:30:11.123 --> 00:30:14.466
as we've got it,
not a whiff of that as far as I

00:30:14.466 --> 00:30:16.365
can see.
Socrates never says,

00:30:16.365 --> 00:30:19.029
"Simmias, here is where your
objection goes wrong.

00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:21.072
Harmony is not really
invisible, can't really be

00:30:21.072 --> 00:30:23.670
destroyed, whatever it is.
So we don't really have a

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:26.458
counterexample."
Instead, he gets hung up on

00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:29.059
this question,
"Is it a good analogy?

00:30:29.059 --> 00:30:32.490
Is it a good way for thinking
about the mind or not?"

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:36.304
But even if it isn't,
that wouldn't save the

00:30:36.304 --> 00:30:40.501
argument.
Now, I am going to take some

00:30:40.501 --> 00:30:47.403
time to think about whether or
not harmony is a good analogy,

00:30:47.403 --> 00:30:53.039
because I actually think it is
a good analogy.

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:57.274
I think what's going on in the
harmony--the suggestion that we

00:30:57.274 --> 00:31:00.259
should think about the mind like
harmony,

00:31:00.259 --> 00:31:07.032
as though it was the harmony of
the body--is an early attempt to

00:31:07.032 --> 00:31:12.063
state the physicalist view.
Talk about the mind,

00:31:12.063 --> 00:31:16.942
says the physicalist,
is just a way of talking about

00:31:16.942 --> 00:31:19.703
the body.
Or, more carefully,

00:31:19.703 --> 00:31:24.543
it's a way of talking about
certain things the body can do

00:31:24.543 --> 00:31:29.914
when it's functioning properly,
when it's well tuned,

00:31:29.914 --> 00:31:34.679
as we might put it.
Just like, talk about the

00:31:34.679 --> 00:31:40.630
harmony or the melodious sounds
or what have you of the harp,

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:45.930
is a way--these things are a
way of talking about what things

00:31:45.930 --> 00:31:49.641
the harp can do.
It can produce melodious,

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:53.713
harmonious sounds when it's
functioning properly,

00:31:53.713 --> 00:31:58.609
when it's well tuned.
So the harmony analogy is,

00:31:58.609 --> 00:32:03.230
I think, an attempt,
and not a bad attempt,

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:09.059
at gesturing towards the
question, how do physicalists

00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:14.285
think about the mind?
Now, when I tried to get you to

00:32:14.285 --> 00:32:17.567
grasp how physicalists think
about the mind,

00:32:17.567 --> 00:32:22.069
I used examples about computers
and robots and the like.

00:32:22.069 --> 00:32:27.169
Well, it's not remotely
surprising that Plato doesn't

00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:31.440
use those kinds of analogies.
He doesn't have computers;

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.933
he doesn't have robots.
Still, he has physical objects

00:32:35.933 --> 00:32:39.804
that can do things.
And the ability to do things

00:32:39.804 --> 00:32:43.293
depends on the proper
functioning of the physical

00:32:43.293 --> 00:32:46.680
object.
And so, I think he can see that

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.200
there's this alternative to his
dualism.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.165
He can see you could be a
physicalist and say that the

00:32:54.165 --> 00:32:58.281
mind is dependent on the body;
the mind is just a way of

00:32:58.281 --> 00:33:02.619
talking about what the body can
do when it's working properly.

00:33:02.619 --> 00:33:06.067
It's dependent just the same
way that, well,

00:33:06.067 --> 00:33:09.355
for example,
harmony is dependent upon the

00:33:09.355 --> 00:33:14.382
physical instrument.
So I think it's a very nice

00:33:14.382 --> 00:33:19.897
attempt to discuss the
physicalist alternative to

00:33:19.897 --> 00:33:24.281
Plato's dualism.
And that's why it will be worth

00:33:24.281 --> 00:33:27.051
taking some time to ask
ourselves, well,

00:33:27.051 --> 00:33:29.750
what about Plato's objections
then?

00:33:29.750 --> 00:33:33.119
If he can convince us that the
soul is not like harmony of the

00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:35.991
body, maybe that will be some
sort of problem for the

00:33:35.991 --> 00:33:39.667
physicalists.
So I'll come back to that in a

00:33:39.667 --> 00:33:43.384
few more minutes.
But first, let's worry about

00:33:43.384 --> 00:33:46.941
the point that I was emphasizing
earlier, namely,

00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:50.276
even if the soul's not very
much like harmony,

00:33:50.276 --> 00:33:52.969
so what?
If harmony really is invisible

00:33:52.969 --> 00:33:56.256
and harmony really can be
destroyed, then invisible things

00:33:56.256 --> 00:33:57.410
can be destroyed.

00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:04.472
Even if the soul's nothing
like--that's not a good analogy

00:34:04.472 --> 00:34:07.588
for thinking about the
physicalist position or what

00:34:07.588 --> 00:34:10.546
have you--so what?
If some invisible things can be

00:34:10.546 --> 00:34:12.849
destroyed and harmony is an
example of that,

00:34:12.849 --> 00:34:15.577
then, by golly,
it's going to follow that we

00:34:15.577 --> 00:34:18.876
can't conclude from the
invisibility of the soul that

00:34:18.876 --> 00:34:22.836
the soul cannot be destroyed.
So even though Socrates doesn't

00:34:22.836 --> 00:34:26.027
respond to that objection,
we need to ask on Socrates'

00:34:26.027 --> 00:34:29.400
behalf, is there a possible
answer to this objection?

00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:34.690
And I think there are at least
the beginnings of one.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.661
We have to ask:
when we say,

00:34:42.661 --> 00:34:49.672
"invisible things can't be
destroyed," what did we mean by

00:34:49.672 --> 00:34:55.046
"invisible?"
And I want to distinguish three

00:34:55.046 --> 00:34:58.782
different possible
interpretations,

00:34:58.782 --> 00:35:06.761
three different claims.
So invisible means,

00:35:06.761 --> 00:35:18.889
one, there's one possibility,
can't be seen.

00:35:18.889 --> 00:35:29.550
Two, different possibility,
can't be observed.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:38.789
I've got in mind the broader
notion of all five senses.

00:35:38.789 --> 00:35:42.790
Three, different possible
interpretation of invisible,

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:44.300
can't be detected.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:55.929
What we have to ask ourselves
is, when Socrates puts his

00:35:55.929 --> 00:35:57.753
argument forward,
which of these did he have in

00:35:57.753 --> 00:36:00.309
mind?
First, let's be clear on how

00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:07.086
these things are different.
Some things can't be seen but

00:36:07.086 --> 00:36:15.300
can be sensed some other way.
So colors can be seen;

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:18.551
smells cannot be seen,
but of course smells--the smell

00:36:18.551 --> 00:36:21.680
of coffee--can be sensed through
the five senses.

00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:28.801
Sounds can't be seen,
they're not visible,

00:36:28.801 --> 00:36:32.139
but for all that they can be
sensed.

00:36:32.139 --> 00:36:35.920
You can hear them through your
ears.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:40.600
So, without getting hung up on
what does the English word

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.529
"invisible" mean,
let's just notice that there's

00:36:44.529 --> 00:36:49.711
a difference between saying "it
can't be seen through the eyes"

00:36:49.711 --> 00:36:54.809
and "can't be observed through
one sense or the other."

00:36:54.809 --> 00:36:58.991
And then three is a different
notion altogether,

00:36:58.991 --> 00:37:03.544
a stronger notion altogether.
There might be things that

00:37:03.544 --> 00:37:07.340
can't even be detected through
any of the five senses.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:10.644
The number three--not only
can't I see it,

00:37:10.644 --> 00:37:13.303
I can't taste it,
I can't hear it,

00:37:13.303 --> 00:37:15.882
I can't smell it,
can't touch it,

00:37:15.882 --> 00:37:19.728
right?
The number three is invisible

00:37:19.728 --> 00:37:25.770
in this much bolder way.
It can't be detected at all by

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:32.060
the five senses--can't be
detected in terms of its--it

00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:36.570
doesn't leave traces behind,
right?

00:37:36.570 --> 00:37:39.459
I don't see dinosaurs,
but of course they leave traces

00:37:39.459 --> 00:37:42.190
behind in fossils.
There's a way in which you can

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:44.650
talk about it being detected by
its effects.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:47.717
All right.
So again, don't get hung up on

00:37:47.717 --> 00:37:49.650
what does the English word
invisible mean.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:54.463
Let's just ask ourselves,
what notion of invisibility--if

00:37:54.463 --> 00:37:59.535
we'll use the word between these
three ways--what notion did

00:37:59.535 --> 00:38:04.361
Socrates' argument turn on?
Well, the most natural way to

00:38:04.361 --> 00:38:07.789
start by interpreting him is
with number one.

00:38:07.789 --> 00:38:10.898
When he says,
"Invisible things don't

00:38:10.898 --> 00:38:15.820
change," what he means is,
things that you can't see don't

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.960
change,
and so--continue to interpret

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.491
invisible in number four the
same way--invisible things can't

00:38:23.491 --> 00:38:26.826
be destroyed.
On the first interpretation

00:38:26.826 --> 00:38:31.000
what he'd be saying is,
"If you can't see it with your

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.745
eyes, it can't be destroyed."
Now, the trouble is,

00:38:35.745 --> 00:38:39.530
harmony shows that that's not
so.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:42.670
Harmony is indeed invisible in
sense number one.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:44.510
You cannot see it with your
eyes.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:49.300
But for all that,
it can be destroyed.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:53.535
So if what Socrates means by
invisibility is the first

00:38:53.535 --> 00:38:58.171
notion, can't been seen with
your eyes, then the argument's

00:38:58.171 --> 00:39:02.406
not any good.
Harmony is a pretty compelling

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:05.694
counterexample.
But maybe that's not what

00:39:05.694 --> 00:39:09.536
Socrates means by invisible.
Maybe instead of one,

00:39:09.536 --> 00:39:12.436
he means two.
When he talks about the soul

00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:16.010
being invisible and invisible
things being indestructible,

00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.934
maybe he means things that
can't be observed through any of

00:39:19.934 --> 00:39:21.220
your five senses.

00:39:25.429 --> 00:39:32.560
Now, in point of fact,
I think that is what he meant.

00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:43.320
Let me just give a quick quote.
In our edition, this is page 29.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.878
Some of you may have noticed
that there are little

00:39:45.878 --> 00:39:48.489
standardized paginations in our
edition as well.

00:39:48.489 --> 00:39:53.409
So it's in the academy
paginations, number 79;

00:39:53.409 --> 00:39:56.335
he's talking about the
difference between the visible

00:39:56.335 --> 00:39:59.260
and the invisible things,
chairs versus the forms.

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.819
And he says,
"These latter,

00:40:01.819 --> 00:40:06.250
chairs, trees,
stones, you could touch and see

00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:10.090
and perceive with the other
senses.

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:13.573
But those that always remain
the same, the forms,

00:40:13.573 --> 00:40:17.710
can only be grasped by the
reasoning power of the mind.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:22.650
They are not seen but are
invisible."

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:25.270
So I think it's pretty clear
that when Socrates starts

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.495
talking about what's visible
versus invisible,

00:40:27.495 --> 00:40:29.820
he doesn't mean to limit
himself to vision;

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:34.690
he means to be talking about
all of the five senses.

00:40:34.690 --> 00:40:39.454
So when we say--when he
says--"Invisible things can't be

00:40:39.454 --> 00:40:44.738
destroyed," he means the things
that you can't see or touch or

00:40:44.738 --> 00:40:48.030
hear or feel--whatever it
is--see,

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.030
touch, smell, taste.
Those things can't be destroyed.

00:40:57.429 --> 00:41:01.635
Now, notice that if that's the
way we interpret his argument,

00:41:01.635 --> 00:41:04.860
harmony no longer works as a
counterexample.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:09.989
Harmony was invisible when we
meant definition number one,

00:41:09.989 --> 00:41:14.266
can't be seen.
But it's not invisible if we

00:41:14.266 --> 00:41:18.622
mean definition number two,
can't be sensed,

00:41:18.622 --> 00:41:24.284
can't be observed.
Harmony can be sensed through

00:41:24.284 --> 00:41:30.500
the ears, in which case it's not
a counterexample.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:34.320
It's not a counterexample to
four.

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.340
Four says, "Invisible things
can't be destroyed."

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:42.886
And what Socrates should have
said is, harmony is not

00:41:42.886 --> 00:41:47.579
invisible in the relevant sense
of invisible,

00:41:47.579 --> 00:41:52.844
since it can be sensed.
But--and this would be the

00:41:52.844 --> 00:41:57.521
crucial point--notice,
Socrates should've continued,

00:41:57.521 --> 00:42:01.740
the soul is invisible in
that sense.

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:05.010
You don't see the soul;
you don't taste the soul;

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:10.539
you don't touch the soul;
you don't hear the soul.

00:42:10.539 --> 00:42:14.518
So if we understand the
argument in terms of the second

00:42:14.518 --> 00:42:18.865
interpretation of invisible,
it looks as though the argument

00:42:18.865 --> 00:42:24.739
still goes through.
Simmias' counterexample fails.

00:42:24.739 --> 00:42:26.811
Harmony is not invisible in the
relevant sense,

00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:29.289
so it could still be true that
invisible things can't be

00:42:29.289 --> 00:42:32.303
destroyed.
Since the soul is invisible in

00:42:32.303 --> 00:42:37.230
that sense, it would follow that
the soul can't be destroyed.

00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:42.940
However, even if Simmias'
objection, his particular

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:45.909
counterexample,
harmony,

00:42:45.909 --> 00:42:51.334
fails, that doesn't mean that
we should still accept the

00:42:51.334 --> 00:42:57.350
argument because there might be
a different counterexample.

00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:01.886
So here's my proposal.
Suppose we think not about

00:43:01.886 --> 00:43:08.860
harmony but radio waves.
Radio waves are not sensible.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:15.750
They are not observable.
You don't see a radio wave.

00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:20.329
You can't touch a radio wave;
you can't smell a radio wave,

00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:24.220
and interestingly enough,
you can't hear radio waves.

00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.077
But of course,
for all that,

00:43:29.077 --> 00:43:30.160
they can be destroyed.

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:39.313
So even if we grant that what
Socrates meant by invisible was

00:43:39.313 --> 00:43:42.823
"cannot be observed,"
we still have to say,

00:43:42.823 --> 00:43:45.878
with Simmias,
"You know, four is just not

00:43:45.878 --> 00:43:48.856
true.
Some invisible things can be

00:43:48.856 --> 00:43:51.871
destroyed."
Radio waves can be destroyed

00:43:51.871 --> 00:43:55.660
even though they're invisible in
the relevant sense.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:59.884
Yeah? Question?
Student:

00:43:59.884 --> 00:44:08.315
[inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:44:08.315 --> 00:44:11.679
Okay.
So the suggestion was,

00:44:11.679 --> 00:44:14.650
radio waves are a bit like the
forms.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:15.304
Student:
[inaudible]

00:44:15.304 --> 00:44:16.513
Professor Shelly Kagan:
They're not forms,

00:44:16.513 --> 00:44:17.420
but they're perfect in that
way.

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.300
Was that the thought?
Student:

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.349
[inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:

00:44:22.349 --> 00:44:23.659
Ah!
Okay, I misunderstood.

00:44:23.659 --> 00:44:27.332
So the question is rather,
"Look, radio waves are not like

00:44:27.332 --> 00:44:30.812
forms," to which the answer is
"Yes, that's exactly the

00:44:30.812 --> 00:44:33.696
problem."
They are invisible,

00:44:33.696 --> 00:44:38.326
like the forms,
but unlike the forms they're

00:44:38.326 --> 00:44:42.734
destructible.
And that's precisely why we've

00:44:42.734 --> 00:44:47.503
got to worry about the soul.
Is the soul invisible in the

00:44:47.503 --> 00:44:50.531
way the forms are,
being indestructible,

00:44:50.531 --> 00:44:54.412
or is it invisible in the way
that radio waves are,

00:44:54.412 --> 00:44:57.405
destructible?
Now again, my point here is not

00:44:57.405 --> 00:44:59.000
to say, "Oh, you idiot,
Plato!

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.119
Why didn't you think of radio
waves?"

00:45:02.119 --> 00:45:05.372
Our question is not,
was Plato overlooking something

00:45:05.372 --> 00:45:09.561
he should've thought of?
It's, does his argument work or

00:45:09.561 --> 00:45:12.341
not?
Is it true that the invisible

00:45:12.341 --> 00:45:16.156
things can't be destroyed?
And it seems to me that some

00:45:16.156 --> 00:45:18.852
things that are invisible in the
relevant sense,

00:45:18.852 --> 00:45:22.179
radio waves being an example of
that, can be destroyed.

00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:26.526
So even though the soul is also
invisible in the relevant sense,

00:45:26.526 --> 00:45:29.010
maybe it can be destroyed as
well.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.784
Now, the answer,
it seems to me,

00:45:30.784 --> 00:45:34.277
the only answer I can imagine
Socrates or Plato giving at this

00:45:34.277 --> 00:45:35.989
point,
is to say, "Look,

00:45:35.989 --> 00:45:38.940
I need a different definition
of invisible.

00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:45.306
Not two, but three.
Don't talk about what we can

00:45:45.306 --> 00:45:48.190
sense;
talk about what we can detect."

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:56.280
Radio waves can be detected,
right?

00:45:56.280 --> 00:46:00.876
After all, radios do that.
You turn on your radio,

00:46:00.876 --> 00:46:03.447
the radio wave's passing by,
boom--properly tuned,

00:46:03.447 --> 00:46:06.832
you detect it.
It turns it into these sounds

00:46:06.832 --> 00:46:10.795
that we can hear.
We can detect radio waves on

00:46:10.795 --> 00:46:15.800
the basis of their effects on
radios, among other things.

00:46:19.269 --> 00:46:22.617
So maybe by invisible he
should've moved to this

00:46:22.617 --> 00:46:25.679
stronger, bolder definition of
invisible.

00:46:25.679 --> 00:46:29.661
Let's call something invisible
not only if it can't seen,

00:46:29.661 --> 00:46:33.287
not only if it can't be
observed, but if it can't be

00:46:33.287 --> 00:46:35.496
detected at all.
Look, the forms,

00:46:35.496 --> 00:46:39.487
after all, can't be detected.
There's no radio for the number

00:46:39.487 --> 00:46:44.523
three that will tell--There's no
Geiger counter to tell you the

00:46:44.523 --> 00:46:48.260
number three is nearby or
something, right?

00:46:48.260 --> 00:46:52.749
So Plato could still insist
things that are invisible,

00:46:52.749 --> 00:46:57.070
in the sense of undetectable,
can't be destroyed.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:47:00.190
But radio waves,
they're detectable.

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:02.261
So they're not a
counterexample,

00:47:02.261 --> 00:47:06.003
now that we interpret the
relevant notion of invisibility

00:47:06.003 --> 00:47:10.280
as undetectability.
So couldn't Plato continue to

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:15.951
claim, things that are fully
invisible, meaning undetectable,

00:47:15.951 --> 00:47:19.260
those things can't be
destroyed.

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.070
Radio waves aren't a
counterexample to that.

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.090
I think maybe Plato could say
that.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:29.340
But, if we give him four,
where we read invisible as

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:35.311
meaning utterly undetectable,
it's no longer so clear to me

00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:40.550
that we can give him five.
Is the soul invisible?

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:44.764
Well, it was,
when by invisibility we meant

00:47:44.764 --> 00:47:49.561
can't be seen;
it was, when by invisibility we

00:47:49.561 --> 00:47:55.119
meant can't be tasted or touched
or heard or smelled.

00:47:55.119 --> 00:48:01.407
But is it still invisible if by
invisibility we mean can't be

00:48:01.407 --> 00:48:06.508
detected?
Is it true that the soul can't

00:48:06.508 --> 00:48:09.155
be detected?
I've got to say,

00:48:09.155 --> 00:48:12.665
I think it's no longer right.
Once we interpret invisibility

00:48:12.665 --> 00:48:16.293
that way, the soul is detectable
in just the way--not literally

00:48:16.293 --> 00:48:19.022
just the way,
but in something similar to the

00:48:19.022 --> 00:48:21.219
way--that radio waves are
detectable.

00:48:21.219 --> 00:48:24.153
If you hook a radio wave up
with a radio,

00:48:24.153 --> 00:48:27.599
you can tell the radio
is--radio wave--was there

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:32.219
because of what the radio's
doing, giving off these sounds.

00:48:32.219 --> 00:48:38.306
If you hook a soul up to a
body, you can tell the soul is

00:48:38.306 --> 00:48:45.480
there by what the body is doing,
discussing philosophy with you.

00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.532
You detect the presence of your
friend's soul through its

00:48:50.532 --> 00:48:53.420
effects on your friend's body.

00:48:57.119 --> 00:49:00.929
But that means the soul isn't
really undetectable.

00:49:00.929 --> 00:49:03.340
But if the soul's not really
undetectable,

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:06.280
it's not really invisible in
the relevant sense.

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:09.457
And if it's not really
invisible, then even if there is

00:49:09.457 --> 00:49:12.828
a notion of invisible,
such that things that are

00:49:12.828 --> 00:49:17.294
invisible in that sense can't be
destroyed, the soul's not

00:49:17.294 --> 00:49:21.458
invisible in that sense.
I've gone over this argument at

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:25.423
such length because--I hope it's
clear--I think it's a pretty

00:49:25.423 --> 00:49:29.917
interesting argument.
The argument from simplicity is

00:49:29.917 --> 00:49:33.356
quite fascinating.
The idea that you couldn't

00:49:33.356 --> 00:49:37.370
break the soul if it didn't have
parts, and the way to tell that

00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:40.619
it doesn't have parts is because
it's invisible,

00:49:40.619 --> 00:49:43.438
because invisible things can't
have parts, that's a quite

00:49:43.438 --> 00:49:46.662
difficult argument to pin down,
does it work or does it not

00:49:46.662 --> 00:49:47.890
work.
But I think,

00:49:47.890 --> 00:49:52.072
as we think it all through,
we have to conclude it doesn't

00:49:52.072 --> 00:49:54.000
work.
Okay.

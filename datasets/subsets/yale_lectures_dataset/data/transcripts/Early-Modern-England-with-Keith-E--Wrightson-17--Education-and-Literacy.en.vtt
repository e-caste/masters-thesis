00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.982
Prof: Right.
 

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:05.937
Well, today I want to talk
about changes in education and

00:00:05.937 --> 00:00:08.892
the growth of popular literacy
in the sixteenth and early

00:00:08.892 --> 00:00:12.086
seventeenth centuries,
one of the most important sets

00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:15.462
of changes which were going on
in the reign of Elizabeth and

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:17.890
the--
under the early Stuarts.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:18.242
Okay.
 

00:00:18.242 --> 00:00:22.120
To begin with a little context,
looking back at the late

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.240
medieval period,
it's been said of late medieval

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.138
England that at that time all
education was technical and

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:35.494
vocational,
directed to some particular

00:00:35.494 --> 00:00:38.200
occupation or function.
 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.331
And the formal schooling that
we tend to think of when we use

00:00:42.331 --> 00:00:46.600
the term "education"
was really only part of that.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.647
If one thinks of education more
broadly in terms of the

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:55.520
transmission of a culture and
its skills and values and so on,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.940
then of course that was a much
larger thing than simply formal

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.359
schooling and it involved not
only schools but the church,

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:07.793
the household;
many ways in which people were

00:01:07.793 --> 00:01:10.200
instructed for their roles in
life.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.738
So, one can't say that medieval
England was in any way an

00:01:14.738 --> 00:01:16.438
uneducated society.
 

00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:21.518
It was educated insofar as it
needed certain kinds of

00:01:21.518 --> 00:01:26.890
training, but it was a
relatively unschooled society.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.138
Very few children attended any
kind of formal school,

00:01:32.138 --> 00:01:37.690
probably less than 10% in the
late fifteenth century.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.239
Formal schooling was reserved,
then,

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:44.180
for specific occupations at
that time: clergymen,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.940
those who were going to be
lawyers,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.584
some merchants who might need
skills of reading and writing or

00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:54.080
even foreign languages,
some craftsmen and so on.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.962
It was certainly not simply a
clerical monopoly as sometimes

00:01:57.962 --> 00:01:58.950
people think.
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.534
Nonetheless,
it was restricted in its scope

00:02:03.534 --> 00:02:09.210
and tailored to quite specific
occupational needs.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.968
Now at the turn of the
sixteenth century,

00:02:11.968 --> 00:02:15.830
that situation began to change,
and by the late sixteenth

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.658
century it was changing very
rapidly.

00:02:18.658 --> 00:02:23.812
A new enthusiasm emerged in
this period for formal schooling

00:02:23.812 --> 00:02:25.210
at all levels.
 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.970
Why should that be so?
 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.414
Well, there seemed to have been
two main cultural influences on

00:02:32.414 --> 00:02:36.430
that development affecting
different parts of society.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.276
First of all,
there was the influence of

00:02:39.276 --> 00:02:42.780
renaissance humanism,
affecting mainly the social

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:43.508
elite.
 

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:47.962
When we speak of humanism in
the sixteenth century we mean

00:02:47.962 --> 00:02:52.061
not the rationalist,
secular system of morality that

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:55.180
one thinks of today when using
that term.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.447
Rather the term is used to
describe what people at the time

00:02:58.447 --> 00:03:00.870
referred to as the "new
learning,"

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.562
the new learning,
which had emerged in the

00:03:03.562 --> 00:03:06.834
fifteenth century and was
sweeping all before it in the

00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:10.307
early sixteenth century,
championed by scholars like

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:13.468
Erasmus of Rotterdam or in
England John Colet,

00:03:13.468 --> 00:03:14.876
the Dean of St.
 

00:03:14.876 --> 00:03:18.438
Paul's Cathedral,
or Sir Thomas More.

00:03:18.438 --> 00:03:23.083
In educational terms,
humanism essentially involved

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:27.818
the study of ancient languages:
Latin certainly,

00:03:27.818 --> 00:03:31.930
increasingly Greek,
occasionally also Hebrew,

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.610
and the philosophy,
the literature,

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.770
and the history produced by the
writers of classical antiquity.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.105
So it's a process of recovering
more fully the works of

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:47.875
classical antiquity and making
them more available to a larger

00:03:47.875 --> 00:03:51.181
audience,
and all of this was for a

00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:52.060
purpose.
 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.836
It was believed by humanist
scholars that classical

00:03:55.836 --> 00:03:58.692
education,
combined with Christian

00:03:58.692 --> 00:04:03.332
morality, would be a way of
reviving virtue in public life

00:04:03.332 --> 00:04:07.729
and creating order and harmony
in the commonwealth;

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:11.988
it would be a way of training
virtuous princes and dutiful

00:04:11.988 --> 00:04:12.810
subjects.
 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.270
That was essentially the
humanist ideal.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.730
In a way they were trying to
get back to the notion of an

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.757
educated aristocracy,
which had certainly been the

00:04:21.757 --> 00:04:23.550
case in the Roman Empire.
 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.439
The aristocracy of late
medieval England,

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:29.329
of course, was largely a
military one.

00:04:29.329 --> 00:04:32.776
But they wanted them to be
scholars too,

00:04:32.776 --> 00:04:38.079
just as the great figures of
classical antiquity had been.

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:43.250
And this was to prove a
profoundly influential ideal.

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.880
It was transmitted to the
English elite probably via the

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.644
court and also by a number of
influential books which were

00:04:50.644 --> 00:04:52.560
widely read amongst them.
 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.670
One of them was a translation
of an Italian work,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.639
Castiglione's book,
The Courtier,

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.915
originally written in the
1520s and published in England

00:05:03.915 --> 00:05:04.810
in 1561.
 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.699
Another--these titles are on
your handout--another was a book

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:11.617
by Sir Thomas Elyot,
who was a member of Henry

00:05:11.617 --> 00:05:13.110
VIII's secretariat.
 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.910
In 1537 he published a book
called The Governor,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.149
The Book Named The
Governor,

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:23.389
which proved to be a great
popularizer of humanist

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.069
educational ideals.
 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:30.053
Elyot for example laid down a
model of the ideal education

00:05:30.053 --> 00:05:35.125
which suggested that children
should be taught Latin by the

00:05:35.125 --> 00:05:38.721
age of seven,
between seven and fourteen they

00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:42.180
would read Latin classics and
begin to learn Greek,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.930
between fourteen and seventeen
they would be trained in logic,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:50.029
in rhetoric,
in history, and in poetry,

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.019
between seventeen and
twenty-one they would move on to

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.733
philosophy and ethics,
particularly the works of

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:58.709
Plato, which were particularly
valued by the humanists,

00:05:58.709 --> 00:06:02.350
and at the age of twenty-one
they would begin studying law.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.288
And meanwhile they would also
have physical training:

00:06:06.288 --> 00:06:09.470
horsemanship,
sports, the military arts and

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.379
dancing.
 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:12.278
Dancing was considered very
important.

00:06:12.278 --> 00:06:16.202
It taught grace and poise and
they considered that to be an

00:06:16.202 --> 00:06:18.028
important accomplishment.
 

00:06:18.028 --> 00:06:21.923
Well, this is a demanding model
of education which seems quite

00:06:21.923 --> 00:06:25.107
ridiculously demanding;
at least I used to think so

00:06:25.107 --> 00:06:28.459
until I first read the Yale
distributional requirements.

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:32.480
So in a sense we are in the
tradition.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.588
A third work which was very
influential was written by Roger

00:06:36.588 --> 00:06:40.069
Ascham, another man close to the
court, in 1570.

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:43.173
It was in fact inspired by a
dinner table conversation about

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:45.540
education which he had with
William Cecil,

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.916
Elizabeth's principal
secretary, and Ascham put it

00:06:48.916 --> 00:06:51.810
down in writing in The
Schoolmaster,

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.800
published in 1570.
 

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.601
He described it as being
"specially purposed for the

00:06:57.601 --> 00:07:01.471
private bringing up of youth in
gentlemen's and noblemen's

00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:04.391
houses,"
focusing on classical learning

00:07:04.391 --> 00:07:06.088
and sound religion.
 

00:07:06.088 --> 00:07:06.456
Okay.
 

00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:11.091
So renaissance humanism was one
model aimed in particular at the

00:07:11.091 --> 00:07:12.269
social elite.
 

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:17.514
A second cultural influence of
great importance was of course

00:07:17.514 --> 00:07:20.050
the Protestant Reformation.
 

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:23.170
The notion that learning and
sound religion should go

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.750
together was present from the
beginning,

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.574
of course, but the triumph of
Protestantism in the reformation

00:07:30.574 --> 00:07:35.399
gave an even greater edge to the
advocacy of education for two

00:07:35.399 --> 00:07:36.350
reasons.
 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.130
First of all,
they wanted to educate the

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.783
clergy better,
to provide a better educated

00:07:43.783 --> 00:07:48.076
clergy who would be not only
administrators of the sacraments

00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:52.615
but a teaching pastorate;
theologically aware preachers

00:07:52.615 --> 00:07:56.636
and catechizers,
educators of the people in the

00:07:56.636 --> 00:07:57.860
new church.
 

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:02.747
Secondly, they also believed
that education was a vital aid

00:08:02.747 --> 00:08:06.120
to the salvation of the common
people.

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.596
Protestantism after all was
very much a religion of the

00:08:10.596 --> 00:08:12.983
book,
and in their view full

00:08:12.983 --> 00:08:17.452
appreciation of God's will
required the ability to read it

00:08:17.452 --> 00:08:22.129
in the scriptures;
or ideally.

00:08:22.129 --> 00:08:26.189
Hence, there was an emphasis on
schooling and on basic literacy

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:28.680
for essentially religious
purposes,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:34.048
and that in a sense extends the
educational drive of the period

00:08:34.048 --> 00:08:38.639
beyond the social elite to the
population at large.

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:46.950
This is an educational ideal of
much broader social relevance.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.662
So, the educational imperative
then involved two ideological,or

00:08:50.662 --> 00:08:54.440
cultural elements,
humanist ideals of virtuous

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.383
rulers,
Protestant ideals of a godly

00:08:57.383 --> 00:09:01.740
pastorate and a godly people of
more universal relevance.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.899
Both promoted formal education
as a means of social and

00:09:05.899 --> 00:09:09.289
cultural change,
and that's an altogether new

00:09:09.289 --> 00:09:13.220
significance for the
institutions of schooling;

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.320
they envisage social and
cultural change as a result.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.918
And meanwhile of course,
as background to all of this,

00:09:20.918 --> 00:09:23.889
there was the process of
economic expansion,

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:28.801
which I've already described,
enhancing in various ways the

00:09:28.801 --> 00:09:34.389
desirability of basic schooling
for various commercial purposes.

00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:38.440
So what was the response?
 

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:42.383
One response was the gradual
transformation of the education

00:09:42.383 --> 00:09:45.725
of the social elite,
the upper gentry in particular

00:09:45.725 --> 00:09:47.330
and the aristocracy.
 

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:51.320
The sixteenth century
essentially saw the transition

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:55.466
from a pattern of people being
educated in great noble

00:09:55.466 --> 00:09:59.692
households by tutors or
household chaplains to an ideal

00:09:59.692 --> 00:10:03.840
in which people first of all
attended schools,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.837
grammar schools in particular,
and then moved on to the

00:10:07.837 --> 00:10:10.799
universities of Oxford and
Cambridge,

00:10:10.799 --> 00:10:13.288
the ancient universities.
 

00:10:13.288 --> 00:10:17.690
And then sometimes also to the
Inns of Court in London,

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:21.019
which were very much like
Oxford or Cambridge colleges,

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:23.899
but devoted to the study of the
law,

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:27.114
sometimes referred to as
England's third university

00:10:27.114 --> 00:10:31.100
though they were essentially a
separate set of institutions.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:37.746
Well, the universities and the
Inns of Court got this role in

00:10:37.746 --> 00:10:42.288
elite education pretty much by
default.

00:10:42.288 --> 00:10:46.019
In the 1530s,
various humanist advisers on

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:51.206
education still thought of the
universities as primarily a

00:10:51.206 --> 00:10:54.210
place for training clergymen.
 

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:59.014
They wanted the foundation of a
new academy for the social elite

00:10:59.014 --> 00:11:02.980
which should ideally be located
near the capital,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:06.205
but such schemes came to
nothing, and by the

00:11:06.205 --> 00:11:10.932
mid-sixteenth century members of
the social elite were beginning

00:11:10.932 --> 00:11:14.982
to follow earlier precedents of
some of their number by

00:11:14.982 --> 00:11:19.484
attending the universities and
sometimes going on to the Inns

00:11:19.484 --> 00:11:20.759
of Court.
 

00:11:20.759 --> 00:11:24.416
By the late sixteenth century,
that trickle of gentlemen and

00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:28.259
noblemen into the universities
and the Inns had become a stream

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:30.798
and soon it was something of a
flood.

00:11:30.798 --> 00:11:34.650
Many of the buildings in Oxford
and Cambridge colleges which

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:38.307
survive to this day were
actually erected at this time to

00:11:38.307 --> 00:11:42.418
expand the provision for these
larger numbers of students,

00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:46.695
and indeed a number of new
colleges were founded in this

00:11:46.695 --> 00:11:48.950
period for the same reason.
 

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:52.453
There was a massive expansion
in the numbers of students at

00:11:52.453 --> 00:11:54.690
both the universities and the
Inns.

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:57.774
In fact, by the early
seventeenth century the numbers

00:11:57.774 --> 00:12:00.798
of students in these
institutions was at the highest

00:12:00.798 --> 00:12:04.240
that it was to be again before
the nineteenth century.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.106
It faded a little in the late
seventeenth and eighteenth

00:12:08.106 --> 00:12:10.990
centuries and then rose again
later on.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:14.971
All of this meant a very
significant change in the social

00:12:14.971 --> 00:12:18.668
composition of Oxford and
Cambridge colleges and,

00:12:18.668 --> 00:12:21.977
if you look at your handout,
the set of tables that are

00:12:21.977 --> 00:12:24.523
there,
you'll see in table one the

00:12:24.523 --> 00:12:28.509
social composition of a number
of Cambridge colleges.

00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:33.057
These are the undergraduates,
and you'll see that by the late

00:12:33.057 --> 00:12:36.470
sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries,

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:42.227
to which these figures refer,
the college of Emmanuel College

00:12:42.227 --> 00:12:46.259
had 63% of its students of
gentry birth.

00:12:46.259 --> 00:12:50.303
King's College had 58% of
gentry birth,

00:12:50.303 --> 00:12:52.113
and Jesus and St.
 

00:12:52.113 --> 00:12:55.200
John's just less than 50%.
 

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.653
This was the general trend and
it was pretty much the same

00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:01.058
story at Oxford.
 

00:13:01.058 --> 00:13:05.861
Well, the universities had to
adapt to educating these new

00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:10.158
types of students and a new
pattern soon emerged.

00:13:10.158 --> 00:13:14.268
Many of these gentry students
lived in their colleges as what

00:13:14.268 --> 00:13:17.350
were known as "fellow
commoners."

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.875
They ate with the master and
fellows of the college on the

00:13:20.875 --> 00:13:24.586
high table rather than down in
the body of the hall with more

00:13:24.586 --> 00:13:26.009
'plebian' students.
 

00:13:26.009 --> 00:13:30.082
They were also very rarely
involved in actually taking a

00:13:30.082 --> 00:13:30.750
degree.
 

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.450
Most of them pursued their
studies privately with tutors

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.947
who were appointed by their
parents within particular

00:13:37.947 --> 00:13:41.447
colleges to oversee their
education and to look after

00:13:41.447 --> 00:13:45.013
their moral welfare and they
were paid directly by the

00:13:45.013 --> 00:13:46.830
parents to do this.
 

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:50.519
It's the origins of the Oxford
and Cambridge tutorial system.

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:54.044
At this time in fact many of
these students even slept in

00:13:54.044 --> 00:13:55.428
their tutors' rooms.
 

00:13:55.428 --> 00:13:58.514
There would be a number of
little--"truckle beds"

00:13:58.514 --> 00:14:01.206
they were called--
that could be pushed in to the

00:14:01.206 --> 00:14:04.575
wall and pulled out at night,
where these students would

00:14:04.575 --> 00:14:07.662
sleep with their master,
their tutor,

00:14:07.662 --> 00:14:10.350
in his room next door.
 

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:13.960
Instead of the usual formal
course of the university,

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.655
which included rhetoric and
logic and philosophy leading to

00:14:17.655 --> 00:14:21.299
the bachelor's degree,
tutors usually devised for

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:24.139
their students more modern
courses.

00:14:24.139 --> 00:14:28.306
They included subjects like
history and literature,

00:14:28.306 --> 00:14:32.639
geography, modern divinity,
and modern philosophy.

00:14:32.639 --> 00:14:35.570
Some of them prepared special
reading lists for their

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.190
students.
 

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.105
Some of them even prepared for
their students 'digests' of key

00:14:40.105 --> 00:14:43.250
quotations, sort of
sixteenth-century handouts you

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:46.219
could say;
key quotes from the classics

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:49.398
that you could drop in to your
conversation,

00:14:49.398 --> 00:14:53.464
and they would help their
students memorize them in that

00:14:53.464 --> 00:14:54.129
way.
 

00:14:54.129 --> 00:14:57.875
We have an account of education
at Cambridge in the early

00:14:57.875 --> 00:15:01.554
seventeenth century from a
student called Simonds d'Ewes

00:15:01.554 --> 00:15:02.960
who kept a diary.
 

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.379
His name is there on your
handout.

00:15:07.379 --> 00:15:11.479
Between 1617 and 1619,
Simonds d'Ewes was a student at

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:11.711
St.
 

00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:14.960
John's College in Cambridge and
there,

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.663
we learn, he studied logic and
ethics and moral philosophy and

00:15:19.663 --> 00:15:22.914
history with his tutor,
Richard Holdsworth,

00:15:22.914 --> 00:15:25.340
who was a well-known Puritan
divine.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.984
He also went to a few of the
university lectures though not

00:15:28.984 --> 00:15:29.990
terribly many.
 

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:34.418
He practiced his letter style
in English and in Latin.

00:15:34.418 --> 00:15:38.129
It was very important to learn
to write a letter well.

00:15:38.129 --> 00:15:41.033
He went to sermons in the
churches of the city,

00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:44.001
and he discussed modern
theology with his tutor,

00:15:44.001 --> 00:15:46.970
and he kept a theological
commonplace book.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:51.038
He was being trained in
Calvinist theology,

00:15:51.038 --> 00:15:55.504
and he rounded the whole thing
off with what he described as

00:15:55.504 --> 00:15:59.970
"my often conversing with
learned men of other colleges

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:03.830
and the prime young students of
mine own."

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.414
Now all of this was in
accordance with the desires of

00:16:07.414 --> 00:16:11.345
gentry parents to have an
education which was suitable for

00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:15.620
a learned and polished gentleman
of the renaissance ideal.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.010
Richard Holdsworth,
d'Ewes tutor,

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:22.269
put it well in a letter
describing one of his students.

00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:26.822
He was recruiting someone else
to tutor the boy and he

00:16:26.822 --> 00:16:30.857
described the boy's father's
desires as follows:

00:16:30.857 --> 00:16:36.097
"His father means not to
have him a scholar by profession

00:16:36.097 --> 00:16:40.822
but only to be seasoned with the
varnish of learning and

00:16:40.822 --> 00:16:42.538
piety."
 

00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:44.759
And that pretty much sums up
what they were aiming at.

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:47.962
"His father means him not
to have him a scholar by

00:16:47.962 --> 00:16:52.316
profession"--
God forbid -- "but only to

00:16:52.316 --> 00:16:58.240
be seasoned with the varnish of
learning and piety."

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.789
The Inns of Court,
down in London,

00:17:00.789 --> 00:17:04.500
adapted far less to the needs
of new students.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.410
Students got no special help.
 

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.068
There was no tutorial system.
 

00:17:08.068 --> 00:17:10.278
They simply had to read law
books,

00:17:10.278 --> 00:17:13.240
to attend the courts to see how
it was done,

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:18.544
to attend formal exercises in
the Inns where they would plead

00:17:18.544 --> 00:17:23.240
cases,
sort of mock hearings.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.566
English common law at this time
was considered quite appallingly

00:17:27.566 --> 00:17:28.390
difficult.
 

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:31.019
It hadn't really been
systematized at all.

00:17:31.019 --> 00:17:34.326
It's been described by one
legal historian as "a

00:17:34.326 --> 00:17:37.531
formless,
confused jumble of undigested

00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:41.576
particulars successfully
resisting all efforts at

00:17:41.576 --> 00:17:45.619
simplification or systematic
statement."

00:17:45.619 --> 00:17:48.328
You just had to learn it all.
 

00:17:48.328 --> 00:17:53.180
Students who tried to do so
seriously found it quite awful.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.848
In fact, Simonds d'Ewes,
who went down for a further two

00:17:55.848 --> 00:17:58.808
years at the Inns of Court after
he finished at Cambridge,

00:17:58.808 --> 00:18:02.645
described his two years at the
Inns of Court as "amongst

00:18:02.645 --> 00:18:05.140
the unhappiest days of my
life."

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.509
Those of you planning legal
careers, bear this in mind.

00:18:08.509 --> 00:18:10.769
The historian of the Inns of
Court,

00:18:10.769 --> 00:18:14.012
Wilfrid Prest,
reckons that the average

00:18:14.012 --> 00:18:18.962
gentleman attending the Inns
probably didn't learn all that

00:18:18.962 --> 00:18:20.670
much of the law.
 

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:23.488
Nevertheless,
the Inns were considered very

00:18:23.488 --> 00:18:26.776
important as sort of finishing
schools in a sense,

00:18:26.776 --> 00:18:29.930
centers for all kinds of
informal learning.

00:18:29.930 --> 00:18:32.038
After all, they were located in
London,

00:18:32.038 --> 00:18:34.549
just in between the city of
London and the royal capital of

00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:36.694
Westminster,
where the courts met,

00:18:36.694 --> 00:18:40.471
and they exposed students to
all the things which were

00:18:40.471 --> 00:18:42.680
available in the metropolis.
 

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.019
They attended plays.
 

00:18:44.019 --> 00:18:47.279
They went to sermons at the
churches of the city.

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:50.598
They hung out in the taverns
and so forth.

00:18:50.598 --> 00:18:55.029
One student who came from
Dorset, down in the southwest,

00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:59.950
a man with the wonderful name
William Freke,

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:04.078
who attended the Inns of Court
in the early 1620s,

00:19:04.078 --> 00:19:08.536
has left behind a list of the
books he bought during his years

00:19:08.536 --> 00:19:12.190
in London at the Inns and it's
very interesting.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:17.204
He bought many religious works,
many devotional books,

00:19:17.204 --> 00:19:22.315
but he also bought books on
physiognomy, on arithmetic,

00:19:22.315 --> 00:19:23.640
on travel.
 

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.318
He bought history books,
he bought popular romances,

00:19:27.318 --> 00:19:29.700
and he was interested in drama.
 

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.615
He owned a copy--an early
copy--of Shakespeare's

00:19:32.615 --> 00:19:33.670
Othello.
 

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.037
But amongst all the books he
bought while he was in London he

00:19:36.037 --> 00:19:38.088
only bought one law book,
&gt;

00:19:38.088 --> 00:19:40.900
and significantly it was a
classic,

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.371
Littleton on tenures,
the classic outline of land

00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:48.952
tenure law,
which was very much the kind of

00:19:48.952 --> 00:19:53.840
thing a gentleman like William
Freke would need to know when he

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.680
returned to his family's
estates.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.730
Now of course not all of the
gentry did all of this,

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:03.710
but nonetheless many of them
did some of it,

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:08.519
and it led to a significant
transformation of the

00:20:08.519 --> 00:20:13.028
educational experience of the
social elite.

00:20:13.028 --> 00:20:19.150
To give some figures on that:
in 1563,

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:25.251
of the members of Parliament in
that year only 26% had attended

00:20:25.251 --> 00:20:31.522
university,
by 1642 50% had attended

00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:33.970
university.
 

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:38.588
Or, even better,
if one looks at the justices of

00:20:38.588 --> 00:20:43.700
the peace serving in six
counties, in 1562 only 5% of

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.140
them had attended a university.
 

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:52.390
By 1636, in the same six
counties it was 62%.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:59.519
So a real transformation in the
educational experience of these

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:04.118
vital members of the political
nation.

00:21:04.118 --> 00:21:04.636
Right.
 

00:21:04.636 --> 00:21:08.686
Well a second consequence of
these changes was a

00:21:08.686 --> 00:21:13.255
transformation in the
educational level of the English

00:21:13.255 --> 00:21:14.288
clergy.
 

00:21:14.288 --> 00:21:18.238
Don't forget that the
universities still remained the

00:21:18.238 --> 00:21:21.200
major centers for training
clergymen.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:25.401
Around 50% of university
students were still non-members

00:21:25.401 --> 00:21:28.737
of the gentry,
and most of them actually came

00:21:28.737 --> 00:21:32.608
from clerical families or
so-called 'plebian' families,

00:21:32.608 --> 00:21:37.124
i.e., non gentlemen,
and frequently they were

00:21:37.124 --> 00:21:40.098
intending clerical careers.
 

00:21:40.098 --> 00:21:43.140
They tended to do the
full-scale traditional

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:47.523
university course leading to a
bachelor's degree and perhaps to

00:21:47.523 --> 00:21:49.078
a master's degree.
 

00:21:49.078 --> 00:21:52.920
And their numbers were rising
also,

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:56.851
and the rising numbers of these
clerical recruits produced a

00:21:56.851 --> 00:22:00.915
general transformation in the
educational levels of the parish

00:22:00.915 --> 00:22:01.650
clergy.
 

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.531
By the 1630s,
after two generations of this,

00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:11.220
a largely graduate clergy was
established in much of England.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:15.199
There are some figures on your
handout from the diocese of

00:22:15.199 --> 00:22:18.690
Worcester, a large diocese in
the west Midlands.

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.410
In the diocese of Worcester in
1580,

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.640
only 23% of the clergy were
graduates,

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.577
by 1640 it was 84%,
and that was pretty much the

00:22:29.577 --> 00:22:36.088
same story as could be found in
other dioceses at this time.

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:40.151
So, a second effect is the
transformation of the

00:22:40.151 --> 00:22:43.088
educational level of the clergy.
 

00:22:43.088 --> 00:22:47.515
A third response was the
general proliferation of

00:22:47.515 --> 00:22:51.940
schooling opportunities for the
common people.

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:55.188
The sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries were a

00:22:55.188 --> 00:22:57.288
great age of school foundation.
 

00:22:57.288 --> 00:23:01.848
There were many,
many new foundations.

00:23:01.848 --> 00:23:07.398
Notable amongst them were the
founding of endowed grammar

00:23:07.398 --> 00:23:08.390
schools.
 

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:13.624
Many of the principal schools
in English cities carry the name

00:23:13.624 --> 00:23:18.309
King Edward VI School,
or some other name linking them

00:23:18.309 --> 00:23:22.243
to this period of major
educational expansion and

00:23:22.243 --> 00:23:26.834
founding of grammar schools in
the mid-to- late sixteenth

00:23:26.834 --> 00:23:27.900
century.
 

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.318
They were often founded with
money donated by merchants,

00:23:32.318 --> 00:23:36.079
by leading members of the
clergy, by members of the gentry

00:23:36.079 --> 00:23:40.540
from particular areas,
and the motivation was often a

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:45.318
mixture of religious zeal and
regional patriotism.

00:23:45.318 --> 00:23:49.013
For example,
in the county of Lancashire,

00:23:49.013 --> 00:23:54.001
up in the northwest here,
in 1480 there were only three

00:23:54.001 --> 00:23:58.299
endowed schools;
by 1540 there were twelve;

00:23:58.299 --> 00:24:02.696
by 1600 there were twenty-eight;
by 1640 there were fifty

00:24:02.696 --> 00:24:04.558
endowed grammar schools.
 

00:24:04.558 --> 00:24:09.509
Indeed, by that date every
major town and some relatively

00:24:09.509 --> 00:24:14.548
insignificant ones in that
county had a grammar school.

00:24:14.548 --> 00:24:17.827
Two thirds of the money that
was donated for school

00:24:17.827 --> 00:24:20.778
foundation in Lancashire came
from London,

00:24:20.778 --> 00:24:25.928
came from merchants and lawyers
and others of Lancashire origin

00:24:25.928 --> 00:24:28.217
who,
usually at their death,

00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:32.595
left part of the money they'd
made to found a school back in

00:24:32.595 --> 00:24:37.420
their home county to help boys
like themselves to get a start.

00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.828
That's the regional patriotism
element in what was going on.

00:24:41.828 --> 00:24:44.752
Usually, the endowed grammar
schools offered a variety of

00:24:44.752 --> 00:24:45.848
types of schooling.
 

00:24:45.848 --> 00:24:50.109
The education which they
offered was in part classical

00:24:50.109 --> 00:24:54.130
education as the 'grammar'
school name implies,

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.240
preparing people for the
universities,

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.190
but usually they also catered
for the needs of others also.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.663
They had what was described as
the 'vernacular side' where the

00:25:02.663 --> 00:25:06.493
teaching was mostly in English,
and they often had a 'petty

00:25:06.493 --> 00:25:10.451
section' as it was called,
a petty section which would

00:25:10.451 --> 00:25:13.108
focus on the 'three R's':
reading,

00:25:13.108 --> 00:25:16.548
writing, and 'rithmetic
or--well, four R's really--

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:20.788
reading, writing,
'rithmetic and religion.

00:25:20.788 --> 00:25:25.055
In addition to the endowed
grammar schools there were the

00:25:25.055 --> 00:25:28.558
schools which were known as
'petty schools'.

00:25:28.558 --> 00:25:32.160
These were not usually endowed
foundations.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.382
They sprang up and died away
according to whether or not

00:25:35.382 --> 00:25:38.546
there was a particular
schoolmaster who opened them and

00:25:38.546 --> 00:25:41.965
ran them for a while,
but they became increasingly

00:25:41.965 --> 00:25:43.930
common all over the kingdom.
 

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:50.232
Petty schools taught basic
literacy often accompanied by a

00:25:50.232 --> 00:25:53.220
little bit of arithmetic.
 

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.797
By the early seventeenth
century, most country towns in

00:25:56.797 --> 00:26:00.640
England had a grammar school and
several petty schools,

00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:05.866
and in addition petty schools
were increasingly common in many

00:26:05.866 --> 00:26:06.808
villages.
 

00:26:06.808 --> 00:26:11.057
It's not unusual for them to be
kept by local clergymen,

00:26:11.057 --> 00:26:15.383
very often the teaching taking
place in the church porch,

00:26:15.383 --> 00:26:17.160
weather permitting.
 

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.464
All in all then we have a
transformation of elite

00:26:19.464 --> 00:26:21.535
education,
we have a transformation of

00:26:21.535 --> 00:26:25.261
clerical education,
and a vast increase in the

00:26:25.261 --> 00:26:30.367
schooling available to the
common people of town and

00:26:30.367 --> 00:26:31.470
country.
 

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:36.078
All of this was a very
considerable achievement.

00:26:36.078 --> 00:26:38.827
But at the same time it's
important to grasp that there

00:26:38.827 --> 00:26:40.098
were some limits to it.
 

00:26:40.098 --> 00:26:42.223
Historians have spoken of an
"educational

00:26:42.223 --> 00:26:44.442
revolution"
taking place in this period and

00:26:44.442 --> 00:26:46.519
I think that is in many ways
justified,

00:26:46.519 --> 00:26:48.950
but it also inevitably had its
limits.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:53.347
And those limits were most
clear when one looks at the

00:26:53.347 --> 00:26:58.410
differences of social rank and
gender, as one might expect.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:01.423
If the period saw a real
expansion of educational

00:27:01.423 --> 00:27:04.878
opportunity, access to it was
almost inevitably socially

00:27:04.878 --> 00:27:06.009
circumscribed.
 

00:27:06.009 --> 00:27:08.848
The Inns of Court were very
much elite institutions.

00:27:08.848 --> 00:27:13.318
90% of the students were of
gentry origin.

00:27:13.318 --> 00:27:15.444
The universities,
as we've seen,

00:27:15.444 --> 00:27:19.078
were also dominated by the
gentry and the 50% or so of

00:27:19.078 --> 00:27:23.055
students who were of plebeian
birth were not drawn from the

00:27:23.055 --> 00:27:23.809
poor.
 

00:27:23.809 --> 00:27:25.940
Plebeian just meant non-gentry.
 

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:30.105
They were usually the sons of
clergymen, of merchants,

00:27:30.105 --> 00:27:32.933
the urban elite,
professional people,

00:27:32.933 --> 00:27:34.269
and so forth.
 

00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:35.970
And the reasons for this are
obvious enough.

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:39.608
That kind of education was very
costly.

00:27:39.608 --> 00:27:43.450
Children from relatively humble
families could sometimes make it

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:47.230
to the university if they had a
patron who would help them,

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:48.920
pay some of the fees for them.
 

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.800
Sometimes talented children
were spotted by a local

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.086
clergyman or a gentleman who
would help them on their way,

00:27:55.086 --> 00:27:56.700
find them a scholarship.
 

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.893
It was also possible to work
your way through by acting as a

00:28:00.893 --> 00:28:03.308
servant for the gentry students.
 

00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:07.880
Students who did that were
known as servitors or sizars.

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.161
Interestingly,
a study done of them shows that

00:28:11.161 --> 00:28:14.952
servitors and sizars working
their way through almost

00:28:14.952 --> 00:28:19.133
invariably graduated,
whereas the gentlemen they

00:28:19.133 --> 00:28:22.118
served of course very rarely
did.

00:28:22.118 --> 00:28:24.634
Nevertheless,
it's obviously the case that

00:28:24.634 --> 00:28:27.948
university education and
education at the Inns of Court

00:28:27.948 --> 00:28:31.630
was heavily monopolized by the
upper reaches of society.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:35.970
The same was true to a lesser
extent in the grammar schools.

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:39.328
The sons of the gentry might
attend,

00:28:39.328 --> 00:28:44.380
most of the other students were
the children of the clergy and

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:48.519
the professional and
craftspeople of the towns,

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:51.952
with a few sons of yeoman
farmers from the countryside

00:28:51.952 --> 00:28:52.730
attending.
 

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:56.559
The problems inhibiting the
attendance of children at these

00:28:56.559 --> 00:28:59.068
schools was first of all the
costs,

00:28:59.068 --> 00:29:03.690
fees, boarding in the town
where the school was,

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:06.400
but also, perhaps even more
importantly,

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.259
perceived need.
 

00:29:08.259 --> 00:29:11.666
This kind of grammar school
education was regarded as

00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:15.663
appropriate only for people who
would be going on to enter the

00:29:15.663 --> 00:29:18.808
professions or trade at a fairly
high level.

00:29:18.808 --> 00:29:23.588
It wasn't deemed appropriate
for farmers' sons to get that

00:29:23.588 --> 00:29:25.348
level of education.
 

00:29:25.348 --> 00:29:29.325
When one gets to the petty
schools, they were much more

00:29:29.325 --> 00:29:33.596
open and the evidence suggests a
much wider intake in local

00:29:33.596 --> 00:29:34.480
society.
 

00:29:34.480 --> 00:29:37.240
Nevertheless,
there were still inhibitions.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.588
Fees still needed to be paid,
even if they were small.

00:29:40.588 --> 00:29:44.512
You had to supply your own
books and paper and pens and

00:29:44.512 --> 00:29:48.220
some families couldn't afford
this kind of thing.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.980
There was also the problem of
conflict with the labor needs of

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.230
farm families.
 

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:58.189
Children were often put to
school at the age of five or six

00:29:58.189 --> 00:30:02.012
but taken away at the age of
seven when they were able to

00:30:02.012 --> 00:30:05.700
play a more productive role in
the family economy.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.426
So sometimes their working
lives had begun before they'd

00:30:09.426 --> 00:30:12.410
had the opportunity to gain much
learning.

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:16.779
One seventeenth-century
autobiographer described how his

00:30:16.779 --> 00:30:21.308
brothers attended school in some
of the winter months,

00:30:21.308 --> 00:30:24.176
but were busy on the farm for
most of the rest of the year

00:30:24.176 --> 00:30:26.384
and,
as he said, what they learned

00:30:26.384 --> 00:30:29.200
when they attended school they
soon forgot.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:34.480
He was kept at school by his
father constantly because his

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:40.226
father intended to put him into
trade and so he gained a pretty

00:30:40.226 --> 00:30:42.078
sound education.
 

00:30:42.078 --> 00:30:45.776
Well, the relative failure of
the mass of the population to

00:30:45.776 --> 00:30:49.088
participate beyond the level of
the petty school,

00:30:49.088 --> 00:30:53.980
if that, is fairly strikingly
brought out when we look at the

00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:58.301
available figures that
historians have put together on

00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:01.400
the subject of levels of
literacy.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.741
You might well ask,
how on earth can we measure

00:31:04.741 --> 00:31:08.230
literacy in such a distant
period of the past?

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:12.265
Well, the usual way of doing
that is to get large samples of

00:31:12.265 --> 00:31:16.163
people putting their names to
documents and to distinguish

00:31:16.163 --> 00:31:19.380
between those who could write
their names,

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:23.027
who could sign their names,
and those who simply made a

00:31:23.027 --> 00:31:23.500
mark.
 

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.660
If you look at the illustration
on your handout,

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.898
that's a petition signed by a
lot of people whose names are

00:31:30.898 --> 00:31:34.904
there at the bottom,
and you'll see for example on

00:31:34.904 --> 00:31:39.953
the left-hand side a scribe has
written in the names followed by

00:31:39.953 --> 00:31:43.800
"his mark,"
and on the left of that you

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.970
have the marks of the various
people concerned.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:52.269
On the other side of the sheet,
there a number of examples of

00:31:52.269 --> 00:31:55.779
people who had successfully
signed their names.

00:31:55.779 --> 00:31:59.892
So it's possible to get large
samples of evidence of whether

00:31:59.892 --> 00:32:03.028
people could or could not sign
their names.

00:32:03.028 --> 00:32:06.700
One might be skeptical about
how meaningful that is.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:10.541
After all, one could learn to
sign one's name even if one was

00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:12.720
in other ways scarcely literate.
 

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.710
But that was very unlikely in
this period.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.435
To be unable to sign your name
was not a great social

00:32:18.435 --> 00:32:21.108
embarrassment for most members
of the population.

00:32:21.108 --> 00:32:25.298
It wasn't something they would
need to try to avoid,

00:32:25.298 --> 00:32:29.284
and again the schooling
practice of the time was that

00:32:29.284 --> 00:32:33.497
children only began to learn to
write once they'd become

00:32:33.497 --> 00:32:35.259
proficient readers.
 

00:32:35.259 --> 00:32:39.318
So if you got--if you had
proceeded with writing far along

00:32:39.318 --> 00:32:43.449
enough to be able to handle a
quill pen well enough to sign

00:32:43.449 --> 00:32:48.150
your name the likelihood is that
you were a proficient reader.

00:32:48.150 --> 00:32:52.517
Now this may leave out of the
count some people who perhaps

00:32:52.517 --> 00:32:56.211
could read reasonably,
but had not learned to write,

00:32:56.211 --> 00:32:59.900
and indeed if you look at the
bottom of that petition you'll

00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:03.650
notice one man's mark which is
clearly an initial letter;

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:04.980
it's clearly an "R."
 

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.150
He was called Richard.
 

00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:10.153
One wonders whether Richard
could in fact read and could

00:33:10.153 --> 00:33:14.960
handle a pen well enough to make
the initial letter of his name.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.348
But historians who do this kind
of work are very strict.

00:33:17.348 --> 00:33:19.788
Either you sign your name or
you don't.

00:33:19.788 --> 00:33:23.538
They know that these figures
are not perfect but it's a clear

00:33:23.538 --> 00:33:26.849
differentiation and we can
compare different areas and

00:33:26.849 --> 00:33:28.599
different social groups.
 

00:33:28.599 --> 00:33:31.710
So that's how they do it.
 

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.318
What are the results?
 

00:33:33.318 --> 00:33:37.355
Well, in the year 1642 massive
numbers of people were required

00:33:37.355 --> 00:33:40.928
to put their name to the
so-called Protestation Oath at

00:33:40.928 --> 00:33:43.838
the beginning of the English
civil wars.

00:33:43.838 --> 00:33:47.578
Studying the returns of the
Protestation Oath which survive,

00:33:47.578 --> 00:33:52.163
David Cressy found that
something like 70% of the adult

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:57.509
men who signed that document
were unable to sign their names.

00:33:57.509 --> 00:34:02.750
30% signed, 70% made their mark.
 

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.846
But he also found that it
varied enormously from place to

00:34:05.846 --> 00:34:06.288
place.
 

00:34:06.288 --> 00:34:11.431
Some places were 90% literate,
some places were less than 50%

00:34:11.431 --> 00:34:16.315
literate, and he also found that
towns were very much more

00:34:16.315 --> 00:34:18.630
literate than villages.
 

00:34:18.630 --> 00:34:23.635
That gives us the broad picture
of what had emerged by the

00:34:23.635 --> 00:34:25.920
mid-seventeenth century.
 

00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.650
Other studies have looked at
the literacy of different social

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.199
groups in particular areas of
the country,

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:39.952
and some of the figures they've
produced are there in tables two

00:34:39.952 --> 00:34:42.510
and three on your handout.
 

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:46.996
They tend to bring out vividly
how there's a hierarchy of

00:34:46.996 --> 00:34:49.079
literacy and illiteracy.
 

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:52.559
These figures are giving the
percentages of people who made

00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:55.139
their mark, who couldn't sign
their name.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:59.101
Table two is a rural area of
Essex and Hertfordshire,

00:34:59.101 --> 00:35:00.929
to the east of London.
 

00:35:00.929 --> 00:35:04.947
Table three is the city of
London and the county of

00:35:04.947 --> 00:35:09.768
Middlesex, which was urbanized,
so that's an urban sample.

00:35:09.768 --> 00:35:14.184
There's a hierarchy in both
countryside and town as you move

00:35:14.184 --> 00:35:18.733
down the social scale;
yeomen in the countryside,

00:35:18.733 --> 00:35:23.923
only 33% can't sign,
if one moves down to laborers

00:35:23.923 --> 00:35:27.949
in the countryside 100% can't
sign.

00:35:27.949 --> 00:35:30.349
But look at the differences
between town and country.

00:35:30.349 --> 00:35:33.914
Tradesmen and craftsmen in the
rural sample,

00:35:33.914 --> 00:35:37.230
42% can't sign,
so more than half can;

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:43.119
but if one moves to the city
only 28% can't sign,

00:35:43.119 --> 00:35:48.030
much higher levels of ability
to sign.

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:53.570
Even laborers in the city were
only 78% illiterate,

00:35:53.570 --> 00:36:00.000
so some laboring men in the
city could sign their names.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.630
What this indicates in general,
studies of this kind,

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:07.164
is that, in the course of the
later sixteenth and seventeenth

00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:10.054
centuries,
illiteracy amongst the social

00:36:10.054 --> 00:36:14.510
elite was completely wiped out;
it was just eradicated.

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:18.143
Amongst the middling kind of
people, yeoman farmers,

00:36:18.143 --> 00:36:21.704
tradesmen and craftsmen,
illiteracy was drastically

00:36:21.704 --> 00:36:22.559
reduced.
 

00:36:22.559 --> 00:36:26.074
Many of these people can read
and write by the early

00:36:26.074 --> 00:36:27.590
seventeenth century.
 

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.123
If you move further down the
social scale,

00:36:30.123 --> 00:36:33.768
amongst husbandmen and laborers
there's much less change.

00:36:33.768 --> 00:36:36.846
Nonetheless,
some of these people also were

00:36:36.846 --> 00:36:39.849
beginning to be able to read and
write.

00:36:39.849 --> 00:36:42.367
It's not surprising that
there's a hierarchy of

00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:45.268
illiteracy in a society
structured as this one was.

00:36:45.268 --> 00:36:49.454
One could say that the
hierarchy of illiteracy

00:36:49.454 --> 00:36:52.989
faithfully mirrors the social
order.

00:36:52.989 --> 00:36:56.871
Nonetheless,
significant inroads have been

00:36:56.871 --> 00:37:00.280
made even low in the social
scale.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.032
Let's turn now to another form
of differentiation,

00:37:04.032 --> 00:37:07.480
not between social rank but
between gender.

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.128
The education of girls was of
course also influenced by their

00:37:12.128 --> 00:37:16.179
social rank,
but at all social levels there

00:37:16.179 --> 00:37:21.960
was a major problem of the
perceived need to educate women.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:25.581
Amongst the gentry,
by the late sixteenth century

00:37:25.581 --> 00:37:29.806
it was already widely accepted
that gentlewomen should be

00:37:29.806 --> 00:37:34.686
taught to read and write,
to sing, to play instruments,

00:37:34.686 --> 00:37:38.394
to dance,
to sew, perhaps even acquire a

00:37:38.394 --> 00:37:40.929
little knowledge of French.
 

00:37:40.929 --> 00:37:44.570
And this education would be
conducted privately.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:48.197
They weren't usually sent to
school, which was considered too

00:37:48.197 --> 00:37:49.650
risky to their virtue.
 

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:52.610
They would be educated at home
by their mothers,

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:55.297
by governesses,
by the lady of the household if

00:37:55.297 --> 00:37:58.510
they were in honorable service
in a great household,

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:04.619
perhaps by the domestic
chaplain of such a household.

00:38:04.619 --> 00:38:06.572
In the early seventeenth
century, there was a little

00:38:06.572 --> 00:38:08.869
change with the founding of some
girls' boarding schools,

00:38:08.869 --> 00:38:13.807
usually in the London area,
but they were few and extremely

00:38:13.807 --> 00:38:14.829
expensive.
 

00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:18.684
So the kind of education that
gentlewomen were getting was

00:38:18.684 --> 00:38:22.472
restricted in its scope though
there are a number of rare

00:38:22.472 --> 00:38:26.461
examples of individual girls who
got a much fuller education

00:38:26.461 --> 00:38:28.829
including classical learning.
 

00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:34.536
One example is Lucy Hutchinson,
a young woman who tells us in

00:38:34.536 --> 00:38:38.646
the memoir she wrote--
of her husband's career--tells

00:38:38.646 --> 00:38:42.485
us that her father believed that
there was no reason why a young

00:38:42.485 --> 00:38:46.139
woman should not receive the
same education as young men.

00:38:46.139 --> 00:38:49.851
So there were people who had
views of that kind even at this

00:38:49.851 --> 00:38:52.429
time, though it was
comparatively rare.

00:38:52.429 --> 00:38:57.342
Girls of lower social rank got
most of their education for life

00:38:57.342 --> 00:39:01.702
either from their mothers or as
servants in the tasks of

00:39:01.702 --> 00:39:02.969
housewifery.
 

00:39:02.969 --> 00:39:07.280
A few of them attended school,
though very few.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:10.280
They might attend a petty
school if their parents wished,

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:14.148
but there was absolutely no
question of them going to a

00:39:14.148 --> 00:39:17.730
grammar school or acquiring
classical education.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:21.795
The universities,
of course, were closed to

00:39:21.795 --> 00:39:22.570
women.
 

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:26.295
The general lack of perceived
need for girls' schooling is

00:39:26.295 --> 00:39:30.219
shown in the invariably high
illiteracy figures for women.

00:39:30.219 --> 00:39:34.523
If you look at the figures on
the handout again,

00:39:34.523 --> 00:39:39.744
you'll see that in the rural
area women were 95% unable to

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:42.400
sign and in the city 76%.
 

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.394
These figures may possibly
exaggerate female illiteracy,

00:39:46.394 --> 00:39:50.463
because it was women above all
who were most likely to be

00:39:50.463 --> 00:39:54.731
taught to read but not to write;
taught to read for religious

00:39:54.731 --> 00:39:58.154
reasons but it wasn't considered
necessary to teach them to

00:39:58.154 --> 00:40:01.340
write, so the figures for women
may be exaggerated.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.932
Nonetheless,
overall, girls of the 'middling

00:40:04.932 --> 00:40:10.030
sort' might stand a chance of
learning to read and possibly to

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:15.500
write,
but below that level there was

00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:19.139
almost total exclusion.
 

00:40:19.139 --> 00:40:24.148
Well, to draw towards a
conclusion, what was the overall

00:40:24.148 --> 00:40:28.610
significance of all of this
educational change?

00:40:28.610 --> 00:40:33.601
Well, with all reservations,
I think these developments are

00:40:33.601 --> 00:40:35.840
very significant indeed.
 

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:39.284
The transformation of the
education of the social elite

00:40:39.284 --> 00:40:43.047
was arguably a very significant
step towards the growth of a

00:40:43.047 --> 00:40:46.809
homogeneous national culture
amongst the ruling class,

00:40:46.809 --> 00:40:49.710
created by a highly
standardized pattern of

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:54.534
education in which many of them,
if not most of them,

00:40:54.534 --> 00:40:56.219
participated.
 

00:40:56.219 --> 00:41:00.286
These were people who were
still very much at home in their

00:41:00.286 --> 00:41:02.110
country, their province.
 

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:06.320
They frequently spoke still
with strong regional accents--

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.338
Sir Walter Raleigh was said to
have a particularly strong west

00:41:09.338 --> 00:41:11.963
country accent,
which was noted at the

00:41:11.963 --> 00:41:15.824
court--but also these people
were experiencing the

00:41:15.824 --> 00:41:20.788
assimilation and the capacity to
manipulate a generalized system

00:41:20.788 --> 00:41:25.514
of cultural standards and values
conveyed to them through the

00:41:25.514 --> 00:41:29.139
classical learning they were
acquiring.

00:41:29.139 --> 00:41:33.119
And when one reads their
letters, on paper they're

00:41:33.119 --> 00:41:35.150
remarkably homogeneous.
 

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:38.380
There's a common range of
reference that they allude to--

00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:42.668
pointed out in one recent study
of a pamphlet written by a

00:41:42.668 --> 00:41:46.429
country magistrate on the
subject of witchcraft;

00:41:46.429 --> 00:41:49.443
the classical allusions which
he casually throws out and the

00:41:49.443 --> 00:41:52.201
biblical references which he
casually throws out in the

00:41:52.201 --> 00:41:53.579
course of the pamphlet.
 

00:41:53.579 --> 00:41:56.065
He simply assumes that his
readers amongst fellow

00:41:56.065 --> 00:41:58.550
magistrates will know what he's
talking about.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:03.121
They belong to a common
cultural world based on the

00:42:03.121 --> 00:42:07.418
classics, the Bible,
certain forms of Protestant

00:42:07.418 --> 00:42:09.340
theology and law.
 

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:13.114
Again the transformation of the
education at the level of the

00:42:13.114 --> 00:42:15.380
clergy is surely very
significant.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:20.547
Most parishes by 1640 had what
you could reasonably call a kind

00:42:20.547 --> 00:42:22.800
of resident intellectual.
 

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.407
It's a development full of
potential implications for the

00:42:26.407 --> 00:42:30.208
penetration of the countryside
by the cultural values of the

00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:33.445
university,
through the contacts between

00:42:33.445 --> 00:42:38.329
these clergymen and those whom
they served in their parishes.

00:42:38.329 --> 00:42:42.271
Lower on the social scale the
achievement may seem much more

00:42:42.271 --> 00:42:46.280
limited, but I think one should
think about it positively.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.309
A certain threshold had been
crossed.

00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:54.500
In every parish there were at
least some of the common people,

00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:58.753
certainly those of middle rank
and some of those even below

00:42:58.753 --> 00:43:02.409
that,
who could read, who could write.

00:43:02.409 --> 00:43:07.324
Literacy was now something that
people would encounter much more

00:43:07.324 --> 00:43:12.003
frequently in many contexts of
life, something they would use

00:43:12.003 --> 00:43:13.719
for many purposes.
 

00:43:13.719 --> 00:43:16.625
To give perhaps a silly
example, I once worked on a

00:43:16.625 --> 00:43:20.507
village in the north of England,
up near Newcastle on Tyne,

00:43:20.507 --> 00:43:23.280
where, in the late sixteenth
century,

00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.161
every will surviving for that
village was written by the local

00:43:26.161 --> 00:43:28.760
clergyman;
he was the only one who could

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:29.250
do it.
 

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:32.811
The records of the village even
reveal that on one occasion a

00:43:32.811 --> 00:43:35.719
man who was dying,
who hadn't made his will,

00:43:35.719 --> 00:43:39.503
sent urgently for the clergyman
and they couldn't find him

00:43:39.503 --> 00:43:41.429
because he'd gone fishing.
 

00:43:41.429 --> 00:43:44.016
A little girl was sent running
down the river to find him and

00:43:44.016 --> 00:43:44.750
bring him back.
 

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.449
He came back too late.
 

00:43:46.449 --> 00:43:50.246
The man had died--with his
dying breath he had told what he

00:43:50.246 --> 00:43:54.369
wanted his goods--how he wanted
his goods--to be distributed;

00:43:54.369 --> 00:43:58.175
and we know this story because
those who heard his dying wishes

00:43:58.175 --> 00:44:01.675
had to go to the court and
declare on oath what his wishes

00:44:01.675 --> 00:44:04.929
were because there was no one to
write them down.

00:44:04.929 --> 00:44:07.485
In the same village,
by the early seventeenth

00:44:07.485 --> 00:44:11.085
century there are so many people
capable of writing a will that

00:44:11.085 --> 00:44:14.394
one loses track of the numbers
of people who are acting as

00:44:14.394 --> 00:44:17.163
scribes for their neighbors;
fifteen, twenty,

00:44:17.163 --> 00:44:19.592
in different decades,
who are capable of writing a

00:44:19.592 --> 00:44:19.989
will.
 

00:44:19.989 --> 00:44:24.434
That's the change which is
taking place even in obscure

00:44:24.434 --> 00:44:26.000
country parishes.
 

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.844
Even in such places the
crossing of the literacy

00:44:29.844 --> 00:44:34.509
threshold had opened up new
possibilities which simply had

00:44:34.509 --> 00:44:36.800
not existed in the past.
 

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.936
If one thinks of late
fifteenth-century society as one

00:44:40.936 --> 00:44:45.440
of heavily restricted literacy--
restricted to certain social

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.981
and occupational groups--
by the early seventeenth

00:44:48.981 --> 00:44:52.320
century we have fairly
widespread literacy;

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.746
a partially literate society
which was well on the road to

00:44:56.746 --> 00:44:57.989
mass literacy.
 

00:44:57.989 --> 00:45:01.760
And if you look at the final
chart on your handout,

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.585
there is the long-term decline
of illiteracy right through to

00:45:06.585 --> 00:45:09.489
1900,
and you can see that the period

00:45:09.489 --> 00:45:13.498
we're dealing with is a
significant step forward in that

00:45:13.498 --> 00:45:14.300
process.
 

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.518
Now of course it was a very
long road.

00:45:17.518 --> 00:45:19.739
Right through to the nineteenth
century,

00:45:19.739 --> 00:45:24.110
illiteracy remained closely
related to the social hierarchy,

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:28.271
but there was continuous
advance from the sixteenth

00:45:28.271 --> 00:45:29.768
century onwards.
 

00:45:29.768 --> 00:45:33.873
By the early eighteenth
century, England was already

00:45:33.873 --> 00:45:38.059
probably the most literate
nation in Europe and still

00:45:38.059 --> 00:45:39.750
slowly improving.
 

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:44.134
Outside Europe the most
literate society of the time was

00:45:44.134 --> 00:45:48.380
New England,
a colonial society which had a

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:53.972
disproportionate number of
literate people amongst those

00:45:53.972 --> 00:45:56.210
who emigrated here.
 

00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:58.557
And as a result the
opportunities for a more

00:45:58.557 --> 00:46:01.943
widespread participation in the
growing literate culture of the

00:46:01.943 --> 00:46:03.309
period was expanding.
 

00:46:03.309 --> 00:46:07.518
Ideas and opinions which were
first voiced in elite circles

00:46:07.518 --> 00:46:11.873
could sometimes find their way
down to permeate many areas of

00:46:11.873 --> 00:46:16.347
the social structure,
like sherry seeping down

00:46:16.347 --> 00:46:18.289
through a trifle.
 

00:46:18.289 --> 00:46:22.356
That's not to say that many
people of humble place were

00:46:22.356 --> 00:46:26.121
rushing to read the more
high-flown products of the

00:46:26.121 --> 00:46:27.929
English renaissance.
 

00:46:27.929 --> 00:46:29.980
Some of them did.
 

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:33.639
Some people who began reading
simple things became

00:46:33.639 --> 00:46:37.894
conspicuously literate and
hungry for books and went on to

00:46:37.894 --> 00:46:40.360
read whatever they could get.
 

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.751
But there was also for
more--for those who didn't have

00:46:43.751 --> 00:46:47.079
such ambitions--a growing
popular print culture which

00:46:47.079 --> 00:46:49.000
catered directly for them.
 

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.239
This period sees the birth of
the chapbook literature;

00:46:52.239 --> 00:46:56.005
cheap, penny,
twopenny, sixpenny printed

00:46:56.005 --> 00:46:59.000
works aimed at a mass market.
 

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.228
By the 1660s,
the most popular form of such

00:47:02.228 --> 00:47:06.150
cheap books, almanacs,
were being produced on a vast

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.920
scale.
 

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:13.090
In London 400,000 almanacs a
year were printed in the 1660s,

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:17.039
aimed at the mass market,
and they contained all kinds of

00:47:17.039 --> 00:47:20.780
information as well as calendars
for people to use.

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.648
Most readers of this stuff
would not have been members of

00:47:24.648 --> 00:47:27.481
elite society,
but they did have access to

00:47:27.481 --> 00:47:30.659
some of the issues and ideas of
their day.

00:47:30.659 --> 00:47:35.222
Such chapbooks enjoyed massive
sales and they formed also a

00:47:35.222 --> 00:47:39.548
kind of bridge between elite
society and the mass of the

00:47:39.548 --> 00:47:40.730
population.
 

00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:43.663
One of the great collections of
them which survives was put

00:47:43.663 --> 00:47:46.507
together by Samuel Pepys,
Secretary to the Navy,

00:47:46.507 --> 00:47:50.079
a member of the highest-level
bureaucracy of his day,

00:47:50.079 --> 00:47:53.588
but he enjoyed the cheap
literature as well as the

00:47:53.588 --> 00:47:56.670
learned works that he had in his
library.

00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:59.777
And it could be read also of
course by members of the

00:47:59.777 --> 00:48:01.449
middling and lower orders.
 

00:48:01.449 --> 00:48:06.112
It must have had its impact on
the common stock of images and

00:48:06.112 --> 00:48:10.775
symbols and understandings and
simple information of rich and

00:48:10.775 --> 00:48:13.815
poor alike,
and it fostered a popular

00:48:13.815 --> 00:48:17.119
literacy which could be turned
to other uses.

00:48:17.119 --> 00:48:20.789
If you take the chapbook
romances with their tales of

00:48:20.789 --> 00:48:24.387
knights and giants and so forth,
which were being published in

00:48:24.387 --> 00:48:28.461
the seventeenth century,
and you marry them together

00:48:28.461 --> 00:48:32.014
with the Bible,
what you end up with is John

00:48:32.014 --> 00:48:34.159
Bunyan's Pilgrim's
Progress.

00:48:34.159 --> 00:48:37.083
 He was someone who was
steeped in this popular

00:48:37.083 --> 00:48:37.800
literature.
 

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:41.905
He wrote Pilgrim's Progress
in order to provide a

00:48:41.905 --> 00:48:46.610
religious adventure story which
turned out to be the second most

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:49.969
important book ever published in
English.

00:48:49.969 --> 00:48:52.416
To conclude then,
whether or not we want to talk

00:48:52.416 --> 00:48:55.018
about an educational revolution
in this period,

00:48:55.018 --> 00:48:59.391
the educational changes did
constitute a very significant

00:48:59.391 --> 00:49:01.110
break with the past.
 

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:05.056
However limited,
however circumscribed by class

00:49:05.056 --> 00:49:10.206
or gender, they did open up new
areas of potential in society

00:49:10.206 --> 00:49:11.579
and culture.
 

00:49:11.579 --> 00:49:15.599
Something momentous was
gradually happening across the

00:49:15.599 --> 00:49:18.860
late sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries;

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:22.896
something which I think one can
reasonably say without

00:49:22.896 --> 00:49:27.315
exaggeration was one of the
great transforming processes of

00:49:27.315 --> 00:49:29.449
the early modern period.
 

00:49:29.449 --> 00:49:33.900
Okay.
 

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:34.306
Right.
 

00:49:34.306 --> 00:49:38.168
Well next time I'll take up the
political narrative again,

00:49:38.168 --> 00:49:41.894
turning to the religious
problems and political problems

00:49:41.894 --> 00:49:44.469
of the early seventeenth
century.

00:49:44.469 --> 00:49:50.000

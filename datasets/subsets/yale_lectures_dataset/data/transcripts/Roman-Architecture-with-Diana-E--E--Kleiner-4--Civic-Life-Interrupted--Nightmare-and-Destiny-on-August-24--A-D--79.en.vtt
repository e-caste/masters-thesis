00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.952
Prof: Last time we
talked about a number of

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:09.269
monuments that were connected to
one another geographically and

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.217
also chronologically,
and were also made out of the

00:00:13.217 --> 00:00:16.239
same material:
concrete faced with opus

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:17.420
incertum.
 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.262
I remind you of three of those
today: of the Sanctuary of

00:00:22.262 --> 00:00:27.092
Jupiter Anxur at Terracina;
of the Sanctuary of Hercules

00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:29.830
Victor at Tivoli,
in the center;

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.675
and then on the right the
Sanctuary of Fortuna Primigenia

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:36.060
at Palestrina.
 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.480
We're going to do something
entirely different today.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.130
We're going to look at a single
city,

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.806
one city, in all its aspects:
its public and private

00:00:44.806 --> 00:00:47.902
architecture,
its civic, commercial,

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:50.110
and religious buildings.
 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.630
We can't do this sort of thing
very often,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:59.051
because too few Roman cities
are either well preserved enough

00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:03.840
or well-excavated enough to
allow such an overview.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.620
But this is no ordinary city.
 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.360
This is a very special city.
 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.066
The city we will be
concentrating on today is

00:01:12.066 --> 00:01:12.909
Pompeii.
 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.370
Pompeii was located in an area
of Italy called Campania.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.444
It was located near Naples;
it was located near the

00:01:23.444 --> 00:01:24.670
Mediterranean Sea.
 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.720
It was a small resort town in
the late first century B.C.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.250
and into the first century A.D.
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.670
And you can see it on this map
here, and it's right here.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.372
You can see that this area of
Campania is obviously south of

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:46.930
Rome.
 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.769
It is along,
again, the Mediterranean Sea.

00:01:48.769 --> 00:01:52.129
And you can see Pompeii here
also,

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:53.830
with its sister city of
Herculaneum,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.519
and some of the other
well-known cities from this

00:01:56.519 --> 00:02:00.390
area: Boscoreale,
Oplontis, for example,

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.500
and Naples itself,
ancient Neapolis.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.272
You can see this cluster of
these cities that make up

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:08.068
Campania.
 

00:02:08.068 --> 00:02:12.977
This was an area--the town
itself again was a small resort

00:02:12.977 --> 00:02:13.580
town.
 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.754
It was a town that obviously
had its own population of people

00:02:16.754 --> 00:02:19.188
who made their money largely
from commerce,

00:02:19.188 --> 00:02:21.889
because they were located so
close to the sea.

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.771
But it was also a spot that was
highly favored by the glitterati

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.991
of Rome,
who used to come down to this

00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:30.959
area of Rome,
not only to go to Pompeii

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.379
itself, but to establish villas,
to build villas in the vicinity

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.949
of Pompeii.
 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:39.822
And we have imperial villas at
places like Oplontis and at a

00:02:39.822 --> 00:02:43.628
place called Boscotrecase that
is located here as well,

00:02:43.628 --> 00:02:48.128
and along what is now the
Amalfi Coast and on the island

00:02:48.128 --> 00:02:49.030
of Capri.
 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.014
So this was a town again that
was noticed and was visited,

00:02:55.014 --> 00:02:59.425
even by the most elite in the
city of Rome,

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:03.520
in the capital city of Rome
itself.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.280
But what's very important for
us, from the outset,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.949
is to recognize that although
Pompeii,

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.580
as we know it today,
was essentially a Roman city,

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.740
it had a history that was much
longer than that,

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.460
that went back much further
than that.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.265
And I'd like to go over some of
the major highlights of the

00:03:22.265 --> 00:03:25.408
history of Pompeii,
because they will situate us

00:03:25.408 --> 00:03:28.810
and will help us to understand
the city's architecture.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.199
The history of Pompeii,
as I noted, is much longer than

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.720
the history of Roman Pompeii.
 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.020
It goes back as far as Rome
itself.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.662
It goes back to the eighth
century B.C.--the same Iron Age

00:03:41.662 --> 00:03:45.050
period--when Romulus was
founding the city of Rome.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.810
Pompeii goes back that far as
well.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.705
It was first overseen by an
Italic tribe called the Oscans,

00:03:52.705 --> 00:03:57.687
but the Oscans were soon taken
over by an even more powerful

00:03:57.687 --> 00:04:00.218
tribe called the Samnites.
 

00:04:00.218 --> 00:04:04.085
And the Samnites are in fact
extremely important for the city

00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:07.435
of Pompeii and for the
architecture that we'll review

00:04:07.435 --> 00:04:08.080
today.
 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.173
The Samnite period in Pompeii
lasted from the fourth through

00:04:12.173 --> 00:04:15.848
the third and even into the
second centuries B.C.,

00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:21.038
up to 80 B.C.,
because it was in 89 that

00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:24.100
Pompeii fell to Rome.
 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.629
We've talked about Rome
colonizing this particular part

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.459
of Italy --
not only the area right around

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:33.307
it,
but the area south of it -- and

00:04:33.307 --> 00:04:37.857
Pompeii fell to Rome in an
important military campaign in

00:04:37.857 --> 00:04:38.670
89 B.C.
 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.420
And in 80 B.C.
 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.110
Sulla made Pompeii a Roman
colony.

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.720
What happened thereafter was
the Samnites,

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.276
who had built homes for
themselves and public buildings

00:04:51.276 --> 00:04:54.821
that we'll study here,
the Samnites were essentially

00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:57.019
thrown out of their homes.
 

00:04:57.019 --> 00:05:00.860
Their property was confiscated,
and that property was given

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.980
instead to the Roman veterans.
 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.449
We've talked about the fact
that that was the way the Romans

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:05.910
operated.
 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.538
They paid back their veterans
for loyal service by giving them

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:13.047
land, and they usually gave them
land of those that they had

00:05:13.047 --> 00:05:13.879
conquered.
 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.274
So that happens here as well;
Samnite property confiscated,

00:05:17.274 --> 00:05:20.964
and the Roman veterans settle
in their homes and begin to redo

00:05:20.964 --> 00:05:23.654
them,
settle into using their public

00:05:23.654 --> 00:05:27.589
buildings but begin to remake
them in the Roman image.

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:32.156
The next century and a half saw
the construction of Pompeii's

00:05:32.156 --> 00:05:35.528
most famous buildings,
but we should not forget,

00:05:35.528 --> 00:05:38.230
and we'll concentrate in part
on that today,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:43.079
that some of these buildings
had their genesis under the

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:44.050
Samnites.
 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.654
During this period there was a
very high civilization in

00:05:47.654 --> 00:05:48.310
Pompeii.
 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.574
There was trade with Greek
cities and especially with the

00:05:52.574 --> 00:05:56.687
Greek city of Neapolis,
Neapolis being the ancient name

00:05:56.687 --> 00:05:57.829
for Naples.
 

00:05:57.829 --> 00:06:03.480
The next very important year in
the history of Pompeii was the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.314
year A.D.
 

00:06:04.314 --> 00:06:09.130
62, when the city was
literally-- the city of Pompeii

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.577
was literally shaken to its
foundations by a very

00:06:13.577 --> 00:06:18.682
significant earthquake--
a very significant earthquake

00:06:18.682 --> 00:06:19.300
indeed.
 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.889
And to give you some sense of
that earthquake,

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:28.158
I show you a frieze that
encircles a shrine that was

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:32.475
located in the house,
or that was commissioned for

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.435
the house,
as decoration and as a place to

00:06:35.435 --> 00:06:39.497
place the household gods that
the owner and his family

00:06:39.497 --> 00:06:40.569
worshipped.
 

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:42.569
The shrine had a frieze around
it.

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.425
The man himself,
by the way, was named Lucius

00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:46.790
Caecilius Iucundus.
 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.819
And we're very lucky--you don't
have to remember his name,

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.480
but Lucius Caecilius
Iucundus--and Iucundus,

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.879
fortunately we have a portrait
preserved of Iucundus.

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:57.540
So we can get a good sense of
what he looked like,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.512
literally warts and all,
because you can see that he had

00:07:00.512 --> 00:07:03.160
a huge wart on the lower left
side of his face.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.639
And he was willing to have
himself memorialized,

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:09.300
and here we are sitting and
looking at him today in this

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.778
classroom in New Haven,
as he was really was,

00:07:11.778 --> 00:07:15.088
with this large wart on the
lower left side of his face.

00:07:15.088 --> 00:07:17.569
But a wonderful portrait of
Iucundus,

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:19.930
the owner of this particular
house,

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:23.747
who was obviously so struck,
and probably so effected in his

00:07:23.747 --> 00:07:28.312
own life by the earthquake,
that he decided to have a

00:07:28.312 --> 00:07:34.500
relief commissioned that would
depict the event of 62 A.D.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.829
And you see exactly -- you see
what is happening here.

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:39.617
You can see,
in fact, the great Temple of

00:07:39.617 --> 00:07:43.589
Jupiter, the Capitolium of
Pompeii, which we'll talk about

00:07:43.589 --> 00:07:45.819
today, literally collapsing.
 

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:49.244
And you can see that in front
of that temple were two tall

00:07:49.244 --> 00:07:52.908
bases with equestrian statues
honoring important people of the

00:07:52.908 --> 00:07:53.449
city.
 

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:56.730
Those look also like they are
shaking in their boots,

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.129
so to speak,
and about to fall over.

00:07:59.129 --> 00:08:02.360
If you look down here,
you see the city wall.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.250
And note, your ashlar masonry,
your opus quadratum,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.661
and the use of headers and
stretchers in this wall,

00:08:09.661 --> 00:08:12.120
the wall of the city of
Pompeii.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.180
But you can see the gate is not
doing too well;

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:19.560
it also seems to be tottering
and about to fall down.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.100
So this is a graphic depiction
of what happened then,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.163
and you can--it gives you some
sense of the significance of

00:08:29.163 --> 00:08:32.220
this for the people of Pompeii.
 

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.557
Now at the end of this,
like in so many natural

00:08:34.557 --> 00:08:37.403
disasters--obviously these
people loved living where they

00:08:37.403 --> 00:08:38.765
did;
it's a beautiful part of the

00:08:38.765 --> 00:08:40.654
world--
and they essentially stood up

00:08:40.654 --> 00:08:43.940
and dusted themselves off and
began to remake their city,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.440
to restore their city to what
it was.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.706
And we have,
from this point on,

00:08:48.706 --> 00:08:51.808
from 62 on,
almost immediately seventeen

00:08:51.808 --> 00:08:56.041
years of frenzied building
activity in which the Pompeians

00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:59.678
tried to bring their city back
from the dead,

00:08:59.678 --> 00:09:02.416
so to speak,
to bring it back to what it had

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:03.178
once been.
 

00:09:03.178 --> 00:09:05.778
But you know the punch line
here, you know the end of the

00:09:05.778 --> 00:09:06.149
story.
 

00:09:06.149 --> 00:09:10.005
You know that all of this work,
all of this seventeen years of

00:09:10.005 --> 00:09:15.591
hard work was all for naught,
because on that fateful day of

00:09:15.591 --> 00:09:18.678
August 24^(th) in 79 A.D.
 

00:09:18.678 --> 00:09:23.298
the long dormant volcano of
Vesuvius--

00:09:23.298 --> 00:09:28.207
which you see looming up behind
the Temple of Jupiter in Pompeii

00:09:28.207 --> 00:09:31.263
today--
the long dormant volcano of

00:09:31.263 --> 00:09:35.553
Vesuvius erupted,
covering the city of Pompeii

00:09:35.553 --> 00:09:39.409
and all of its sister cities in
a mass,

00:09:39.409 --> 00:09:44.779
or in a blanket of ash and lava.
 

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:46.409
Covering it forever?
 

00:09:46.409 --> 00:09:48.610
Well not quite forever;
almost forever.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:52.018
Because as you also know,
the city was rediscovered in

00:09:52.018 --> 00:09:55.974
the eighteenth century,
and when it was rediscovered

00:09:55.974 --> 00:10:00.870
what happened there first was a
period of treasure hunting.

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:04.168
Well-to-do individuals,
primarily from Europe,

00:10:04.168 --> 00:10:07.778
made a beeline for Pompeii,
once it was rediscovered,

00:10:07.778 --> 00:10:12.625
and began to build their own
personal collections of art from

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.080
what lay around.
 

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:17.065
They took jewelry;
they took metal items,

00:10:17.065 --> 00:10:18.558
precious metal items.
 

00:10:18.558 --> 00:10:22.908
They even did the unspeakable
by cutting portrait paintings

00:10:22.908 --> 00:10:27.331
and other paintings out of the
walls and taking them back to

00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:31.679
decorate their own palaces and
villas in other parts of the

00:10:31.679 --> 00:10:32.580
world.
 

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.918
That went on for a while,
but fortunately not too long.

00:10:35.918 --> 00:10:39.659
The archaeologists gained the
upper hand and we begin to see

00:10:39.659 --> 00:10:43.210
not long after that a period of
scientific excavation.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:47.289
And I show you two images here,
which show that scientific

00:10:47.289 --> 00:10:51.370
excavation, which show some of
the houses of Pompeii being

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.590
revealed by archaeologists.
 

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.231
And, of course,
it was all--the good work that

00:10:56.231 --> 00:10:58.686
they have done,
and work continues apace at

00:10:58.686 --> 00:11:01.528
Pompeii excavations still go on
in parts of the city,

00:11:01.528 --> 00:11:03.418
that have allowed most of the
city,

00:11:03.418 --> 00:11:08.960
as far as we can tell,
to be revealed to us today.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.129
Now this tragedy that befell
Pompeii, in August of 79,

00:11:13.129 --> 00:11:17.847
was indeed a tragedy for them,
for the people who lived there

00:11:17.847 --> 00:11:18.950
obviously.
 

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.243
It was also a tragedy for the
reigning emperor,

00:11:22.243 --> 00:11:26.397
a man by the name of Titus,
T-i-t-u-s, who's honored in the

00:11:26.397 --> 00:11:28.759
famous Arch of Titus in Rome.
 

00:11:28.759 --> 00:11:31.926
We'll talk about him and his
architecture in Rome later in

00:11:31.926 --> 00:11:32.759
the semester.
 

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:36.465
But it was a disaster for him,
and he had to contend with a

00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:39.658
plague and a fire in Rome also
at the same time.

00:11:39.658 --> 00:11:42.251
It was very difficult for him,
and poor man,

00:11:42.251 --> 00:11:45.809
even though he was quite young,
died of natural causes after

00:11:45.809 --> 00:11:47.678
only three years in office.
 

00:11:47.678 --> 00:11:51.418
And I think it was in part this
catastrophe that had happened,

00:11:51.418 --> 00:11:56.450
in the Bay of Naples area,
that led in part to his--

00:11:56.450 --> 00:12:00.080
the stress of it led in part to
his demise.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:03.282
So this was a great tragedy for
him, a great tragedy for the

00:12:03.282 --> 00:12:05.778
people of Pompeii,
a great tragedy for Rome.

00:12:05.778 --> 00:12:09.580
But it was a stroke of good
luck for archaeologists,

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:13.683
and in a sense for us as well,
because of course what happened

00:12:13.683 --> 00:12:17.653
to Pompeii is something very
different than what happened to

00:12:17.653 --> 00:12:18.259
Rome.
 

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:21.585
What happened to Pompeii is
that it was--its life was

00:12:21.585 --> 00:12:25.230
snuffed out all at once,
it came to an end all at once.

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:28.447
Compare this to Rome,
which has been inhabited over

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:29.220
millennia.
 

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.908
In Rome buildings have been
redone, rethought,

00:12:33.908 --> 00:12:35.889
remade over time.
 

00:12:35.889 --> 00:12:40.298
That never happened in Pompeii
because Pompeii again died

00:12:40.298 --> 00:12:44.775
essentially in August of 79,
and everything that was there

00:12:44.775 --> 00:12:46.788
was preserved,
just as it was,

00:12:46.788 --> 00:12:49.932
and that's how it was
discovered when it was excavated

00:12:49.932 --> 00:12:54.404
in the mid-eighteenth century,
as it had been -- exactly how

00:12:54.404 --> 00:12:58.070
it had been,
on that day in August in 79.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:59.798
This is extremely important.
 

00:12:59.798 --> 00:13:03.596
It's one of our only really
fixed chronological dates,

00:13:03.596 --> 00:13:07.177
and it provides us with an
incredible laboratory of

00:13:07.177 --> 00:13:08.110
material.
 

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.945
Because, again,
everything--nothing is changed

00:13:10.945 --> 00:13:14.471
from the time that it was left
there, except for what the

00:13:14.471 --> 00:13:16.298
treasure hunters removed.
 

00:13:16.298 --> 00:13:19.307
But for the most part nothing
has changed, and we can study it

00:13:19.307 --> 00:13:19.899
as it was.
 

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.658
The other thing that you must
remember from the outset,

00:13:22.658 --> 00:13:26.464
that although what was revealed
by excavators in the eighteenth

00:13:26.464 --> 00:13:28.652
century,
nineteenth century and beyond

00:13:28.652 --> 00:13:33.182
even today,
was not just the--it was the

00:13:33.182 --> 00:13:36.210
Pompeii of August 79.
 

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:39.363
But the buildings that stood
there were not just the

00:13:39.363 --> 00:13:42.764
buildings that had been
renovated between the earthquake

00:13:42.764 --> 00:13:45.610
of 62 and the eruption of
Vesuvius of 79,

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:48.100
but some of the very earliest
buildings,

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.710
including the Samnite
structures, still stood.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:55.190
And so when we look back we
will be able to trace,

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.490
in a sense, the city of Pompeii
and its architecture,

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:03.157
from the time of the Samnites
up until the time of the emperor

00:14:03.157 --> 00:14:03.769
Titus.
 

00:14:03.769 --> 00:14:07.317
I want to begin with a plan of
the city of Pompeii,

00:14:07.317 --> 00:14:08.879
and you see it here.
 

00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:13.883
And the plan that I show you is
a plan of the city as it was in

00:14:13.883 --> 00:14:14.205
A.D.
 

00:14:14.205 --> 00:14:14.690
79.
 

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.480
We see all of the buildings at
that juncture.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.008
We see that the shape of the
city is essentially an irregular

00:14:22.008 --> 00:14:25.705
rectangle,
and we also can see very well

00:14:25.705 --> 00:14:29.450
that the city is surrounded by a
wall,

00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:31.988
a protective wall,
as were--so it was walled like

00:14:31.988 --> 00:14:35.480
all the other cities that we've
talked about thus far this term.

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.802
You can see some of the major
buildings very clearly:

00:14:38.802 --> 00:14:41.614
the amphitheater that we'll
talk about today,

00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:44.490
the theater and the music hall
over here.

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:46.408
You can see the streets of the
city,

00:14:46.408 --> 00:14:49.509
the cardo or north-south
street,

00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:52.482
and the decumanus,
or east-west street of the

00:14:52.482 --> 00:14:54.971
city,
as well as the fairly regular

00:14:54.971 --> 00:14:58.600
blocks where the houses and the
shops were located.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.590
What is important to note,
however, is that the Samnite

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.580
city was obviously much smaller
than the city of 79.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.230
And to recapture a sense of the
Samnite city,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.889
we have to look at the bottom
left side of this plan,

00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:15.320
where we see the original
Samnite city,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.840
which seems to have been
roughly a fairly regular square.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.000
And in that Samnite city,
the Romans--

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.190
and they followed Roman
surveying methodology here--

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:31.323
they looked to what was exactly
the center of the city and they

00:15:31.323 --> 00:15:34.985
placed the cardo,
the north-south street,

00:15:34.985 --> 00:15:38.003
and the decumanus,
the east-west street,

00:15:38.003 --> 00:15:40.370
at that exact mid-point of the
city.

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:42.509
And then they located,
as they liked to do,

00:15:42.509 --> 00:15:45.008
the forum of the city,
the great meeting and

00:15:45.008 --> 00:15:47.683
marketplace,
right at the intersection of

00:15:47.683 --> 00:15:50.649
the cardo and of the
decumanus.

00:15:50.649 --> 00:15:54.134
And that is exactly where we
see the forum that was begun in

00:15:54.134 --> 00:15:56.908
the Samnite period,
right at the intersection of

00:15:56.908 --> 00:15:58.740
those two original streets.
 

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.798
Then over time,
obviously, as they expanded the

00:16:01.798 --> 00:16:05.788
city, the cardo grew and
the decumanus grew.

00:16:05.788 --> 00:16:11.765
And it didn't end up exactly at
the center of the larger city,

00:16:11.765 --> 00:16:16.470
but it was at the center of the
original city.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.863
Let's begin,
in fact, with the Forum,

00:16:18.863 --> 00:16:22.585
because the Forum was begun
itself during the time of the

00:16:22.585 --> 00:16:23.450
Samnites.
 

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.921
You'll see from your Monument
List that I've given you a date

00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:29.639
of the second half of the second
century B.C.

00:16:29.639 --> 00:16:34.470
for the Forum at Pompeii,
and again that indicates to us,

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:36.558
because of the chronology of
the city,

00:16:36.558 --> 00:16:40.052
of the history of the city,
that it was begun in Samnite

00:16:40.052 --> 00:16:40.558
times.
 

00:16:40.558 --> 00:16:44.580
You see here on the screen an
excellent plan of the Forum,

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.672
as it was and as it grew over
time, as buildings were added

00:16:48.672 --> 00:16:49.658
over time.
 

00:16:49.658 --> 00:16:54.956
This plan is from one of your
textbooks, from Ward-Perkins,

00:16:54.956 --> 00:16:58.610
and I think it deserves careful
study.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.750
Let's describe it together
today.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.328
We see that the central part of
the Forum,

00:17:05.328 --> 00:17:08.835
which was again essentially the
main meeting and marketplace of

00:17:08.835 --> 00:17:13.130
the forum,
is a very elongated rectangle,

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.096
with a temple,
a Capitolium,

00:17:16.096 --> 00:17:19.952
a Temple to Jupiter,
located on one of the short

00:17:19.952 --> 00:17:20.608
ends.
 

00:17:20.608 --> 00:17:24.008
And you should be
immediately--your mind's eye

00:17:24.008 --> 00:17:28.311
should go immediately to the
sanctuary designs that we saw

00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:29.368
last time.
 

00:17:29.368 --> 00:17:32.295
Think, for example,
of the Sanctuary of Hercules

00:17:32.295 --> 00:17:35.983
Victor at Tivoli,
where we saw that the temple

00:17:35.983 --> 00:17:40.000
was pushed up against one of the
back walls--

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.294
in that case the long wall--and
dominated the space in front of

00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:42.480
it.
 

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.029
We see the same kind of scheme
here,

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:48.648
where we see this rectangular
space with the temple pushed

00:17:48.648 --> 00:17:50.122
up--
in this case on one of the

00:17:50.122 --> 00:17:52.560
short walls--
pushed up against the back wall

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.308
and then dominating the space in
front of it.

00:17:55.308 --> 00:18:00.228
The Forum itself is surrounded
by columns, a colonnade,

00:18:00.228 --> 00:18:04.417
as you can see here,
and it is open to the sky,

00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:06.240
open to the sky.
 

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.528
Then deployed around it all the
other important buildings that

00:18:10.528 --> 00:18:14.042
needed to be in a forum:
the curia or Senate

00:18:14.042 --> 00:18:18.236
House, over here;
the basilica or law court over

00:18:18.236 --> 00:18:19.762
here;
another temple,

00:18:19.762 --> 00:18:22.058
in this case the Temple of
Apollo;

00:18:22.058 --> 00:18:24.897
and then a series of buildings
that were added later,

00:18:24.897 --> 00:18:25.990
on the right side.
 

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.702
A wonderful building of a
woman, that we're not going to

00:18:28.702 --> 00:18:32.040
be talking about this semester,
called Eumachia--and it gives

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.619
you some sense that women could
wield power.

00:18:34.619 --> 00:18:36.019
It wasn't easy.
 

00:18:36.019 --> 00:18:37.868
They couldn't vote and they
couldn't hold public office,

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:39.690
but they could sometimes wield
power,

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.980
and this particular woman did,
in Pompeii --

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:46.828
a very large building that was
for her and for her trade guild.

00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:49.529
A lararium or a place,
a shrine;

00:18:49.529 --> 00:18:51.960
a market or macellum up
there.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.858
Some of these added later.
 

00:18:53.858 --> 00:18:56.742
But the ones that are
particularly critical to our

00:18:56.742 --> 00:19:00.215
understanding of the Samnite
city are the Capitolium and the

00:19:00.215 --> 00:19:04.651
Basilica,
which both date to the second

00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:06.269
century B.C.
 

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:10.519
Here's a view of--oh I'm sorry,
I did want to say something

00:19:10.519 --> 00:19:13.670
about the Google Earth image on
the left.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:17.461
This is a Google Earth image,
which I tried to take in such a

00:19:17.461 --> 00:19:20.939
way that one can see it,
almost exactly the same vantage

00:19:20.939 --> 00:19:22.328
point as the plan.
 

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:25.467
And you can see everything here
that I've already pointed out:

00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:27.803
the open rectangular space,
the colonnade,

00:19:27.803 --> 00:19:30.410
the temple pushed up against
the back wall --

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.650
the Temple of Jupiter,
the Basilica over here,

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.588
the Temple of Apollo,
Eumachia's building here,

00:19:35.588 --> 00:19:39.750
the Senate House over here,
and so on.

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:43.846
And this again underscores the
value of Google Earth,

00:19:43.846 --> 00:19:48.493
as one can look down on these
buildings and compare what one

00:19:48.493 --> 00:19:50.700
sees to the master plan.
 

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.608
This is a view of the colonnade.
 

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:56.608
It's a two-story colonnade at
the Forum of Pompeii,

00:19:56.608 --> 00:19:59.986
and you can see the same thing
that we saw happening in the

00:19:59.986 --> 00:20:03.263
Theater of Marcellus in Rome,
that the columns that they have

00:20:03.263 --> 00:20:05.567
used --
they have looked at the Greek

00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:07.361
orders,
the Doric, Ionic,

00:20:07.361 --> 00:20:11.634
and Corinthian -- and they have
selected here to use the Doric

00:20:11.634 --> 00:20:15.700
for the first story and the
Ionic for the second story.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.548
This colonnade does not date to
the Samnite period.

00:20:18.548 --> 00:20:20.940
We believe that it was put up
later,

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.308
but it's made out of white
limestone,

00:20:24.308 --> 00:20:28.590
and it probably again does
belong to a renovation of the

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:31.160
Forum of a somewhat later date.
 

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:36.273
Look also near the columns and
you will see a series of bases:

00:20:36.273 --> 00:20:40.548
a large base over here,
a smaller base over here.

00:20:40.548 --> 00:20:42.960
You see a lot of these still in
the Forum today.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.140
And what these bases were for,
of course,

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.787
were to support statues,
statues, and then there

00:20:47.787 --> 00:20:51.450
would've been inscription on the
base identifying who that was.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:56.108
Sometimes they were statues of
the reigning dynast in Rome--

00:20:56.108 --> 00:20:58.269
in the age of Augustus,
it might be Augustus,

00:20:58.269 --> 00:21:02.607
or his wife Livia--but they
also honored the most important

00:21:02.607 --> 00:21:06.049
people of the city of Pompeii:
magistrates,

00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:07.650
great benefactors.
 

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:11.928
Eumachia we know had a portrait
inside her own building honoring

00:21:11.928 --> 00:21:14.778
her, standing next to the
empress Livia.

00:21:14.778 --> 00:21:18.615
So that's--you have to imagine
that while the Forum is quite

00:21:18.615 --> 00:21:21.171
empty today,
that in antiquity there would

00:21:21.171 --> 00:21:24.171
have been all of these bases
with equestrian statues and

00:21:24.171 --> 00:21:27.298
full-length statues,
vying with one another for

00:21:27.298 --> 00:21:30.188
attention --
the individuals honored there

00:21:30.188 --> 00:21:33.736
sort of jostling with one
another to underscore their

00:21:33.736 --> 00:21:37.460
fame,
at least within their own city.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:41.202
This is a view of the Temple of
Jupiter, or the Capitolium,

00:21:41.202 --> 00:21:44.696
in the Forum of Pompeii;
an extremely important

00:21:44.696 --> 00:21:49.404
building, and one that you can
see from the Monument List,

00:21:49.404 --> 00:21:54.029
also what began to be put up
quite early, in 150 B.C.

00:21:54.029 --> 00:21:58.430
But its triple cella,
honoring the Capitoline Triad,

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:01.922
Jupiter, Juno and Minerva,
was, it won't surprise you to

00:22:01.922 --> 00:22:04.643
hear,
put up only after the Romans

00:22:04.643 --> 00:22:10.140
made Pompeii a colony,
and that happened in 80 B.C.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:13.407
So you'll see that I've given
you a date of 150 for the

00:22:13.407 --> 00:22:14.680
temple, but 80 B.C.
 

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.848
for the renovation of the cella
to incorporate these three

00:22:19.848 --> 00:22:23.930
spaces for statues of the
Capitoline Triad.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.548
Let's look at the plan first.
 

00:22:25.548 --> 00:22:27.140
You see it down here at the
bottom --

00:22:30.828 --> 00:22:32.118
you see it down here at the
bottom,

00:22:32.118 --> 00:22:35.865
and you can see that the plan
of the temple corresponds to

00:22:35.865 --> 00:22:39.941
plans that we've seen for other
temples that we've studied thus

00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:42.270
far this term--
the Temple of Portunus,

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.048
for example--
where we see this combination

00:22:45.048 --> 00:22:48.190
of an Etruscan plan and a Greek
elevation.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:52.710
You can see here the
façade emphasis;

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.358
single staircase;
deep porch;

00:22:55.358 --> 00:22:57.960
freestanding columns in that
porch;

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.673
the flat back wall as was
characteristic of Etruscan

00:23:01.673 --> 00:23:05.608
temple design;
the plain side walls over here.

00:23:05.608 --> 00:23:08.538
We can see all of that in this
plan.

00:23:08.538 --> 00:23:12.318
And we also know that the
building was made out of stone,

00:23:12.318 --> 00:23:15.596
tufa, in this case tufa,
not from Rome but tufa from

00:23:15.596 --> 00:23:19.250
this part of Italy,
from the Campanian region.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:23.720
Tufa there for both the columns
and also the capital.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.980
So a stone building.
 

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:28.058
So this same combination of
Etruscan plan and Greek

00:23:28.058 --> 00:23:30.028
elevation that we saw in Rome.
 

00:23:30.028 --> 00:23:33.026
This view of the temple also
shows you that it had a tall

00:23:33.026 --> 00:23:36.288
podium, as was characteristic of
these other early temples.

00:23:36.288 --> 00:23:40.089
Here you can see the remains of
the stone columns and of the

00:23:40.089 --> 00:23:41.250
building itself.
 

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:42.960
It's not as well preserved as
we wish it were,

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.950
but enough is there to give us
a very good sense of what the

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:52.009
Capitolium looked like in
ancient Roman times.

00:23:52.009 --> 00:23:55.388
I mentioned that the other
early structure added to the

00:23:55.388 --> 00:23:59.268
forum complex was the Basilica
of Pompeii, and I'd like to turn

00:23:59.268 --> 00:24:00.269
to that now.
 

00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:04.400
The Basilica of Pompeii dates
to around 120 B.C.

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.720
You see its plan here again,
in the bottom left,

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.615
and you'll remember it splayed
off from the Forum to the left

00:24:10.615 --> 00:24:13.082
bottom side,
as you face the Temple of

00:24:13.082 --> 00:24:13.710
Jupiter.
 

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.846
You can see that the plan of
the Basilica is very interesting

00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:19.983
because it actually is quite
similar to the plan of the Forum

00:24:19.983 --> 00:24:20.558
itself.
 

00:24:20.558 --> 00:24:23.828
It is a rectangular space,
not as large and not as

00:24:23.828 --> 00:24:27.098
elongated, but nonetheless a
rectangular space.

00:24:27.098 --> 00:24:29.970
Its entranceway is over here,
from the Forum.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.086
You can see that there are
columns inside,

00:24:33.086 --> 00:24:36.053
a colonnade,
just as we saw in the Forum

00:24:36.053 --> 00:24:36.890
itself.
 

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:42.210
And the building is organized,
as is the Forum itself,

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.814
axially, so that there is a
focus: something at the end that

00:24:45.814 --> 00:24:49.215
serves as the focus,
and then the axiality comes

00:24:49.215 --> 00:24:50.029
from that.
 

00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:52.150
We see the focus over here at
the end.

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:54.816
It's not another temple;
it is a tribunal,

00:24:54.816 --> 00:24:59.592
a tribunal on which the judge
would sit to try the law cases

00:24:59.592 --> 00:25:01.048
that came here.
 

00:25:01.048 --> 00:25:04.718
The main difference between the
Basilica and the Forum itself is

00:25:04.718 --> 00:25:07.278
that the Basilica was roofed in
antiquity.

00:25:07.278 --> 00:25:11.470
The roof is no longer there,
as you saw in the Google Earth

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:15.372
view, but it was roofed in
antiquity, whereas again the

00:25:15.372 --> 00:25:17.538
Forum was open to the sky.
 

00:25:17.538 --> 00:25:21.064
The view that you see of the
Basilica as it looks today is

00:25:21.064 --> 00:25:22.608
also very illuminating.
 

00:25:22.608 --> 00:25:24.730
We are looking toward the
tribunal.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.269
You can see the tribunal is
actually extremely well

00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.880
preserved.
 

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.529
We get a very good sense of
what it looked like in

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:31.180
antiquity.
 

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.420
It itself has a tall podium.
 

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.076
We can imagine the magistrate
holding court up here,

00:25:37.076 --> 00:25:41.520
on the top of that tall podium,
between the Corinthian columns,

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.740
in this case.
 

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:45.654
We're not absolutely sure,
but we believe the second

00:25:45.654 --> 00:25:48.123
story,
which has smaller columns--they

00:25:48.123 --> 00:25:50.578
diminish in size on the second
story--

00:25:50.578 --> 00:25:54.866
also were Corinthian columns,
because you can see at least

00:25:54.866 --> 00:25:55.920
one of them.
 

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.759
One of them is restored,
at the top right,

00:25:57.759 --> 00:25:59.509
but that one is a Corinthian
capital.

00:25:59.509 --> 00:26:02.900
So we believe Corinthian order
on the lower story,

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.548
Corinthian order on the second
story as well,

00:26:06.548 --> 00:26:10.012
beginning to show this Roman
penchant for the Corinthian

00:26:10.012 --> 00:26:12.680
order,
which we've already discussed.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.808
And you can also see here some
of the lower parts of the

00:26:16.808 --> 00:26:21.013
columns that would have been
encircling the center of the

00:26:21.013 --> 00:26:25.670
structure and dividing the
central space from two aisles,

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:27.538
one on either side.
 

00:26:27.538 --> 00:26:30.708
It looks like they're made out
of brick, but they're actually

00:26:30.708 --> 00:26:32.980
made out of a tile that looks
like brick;

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:36.494
brick wasn't being used quite
this early but a tile resembling

00:26:36.494 --> 00:26:39.665
brick was used in Pompeii,
and we can see that served as

00:26:39.665 --> 00:26:41.279
the core of the columns.
 

00:26:41.279 --> 00:26:44.166
They would've been stuccoed
over though and looked more like

00:26:44.166 --> 00:26:46.952
white marble,
indicating to us again this

00:26:46.952 --> 00:26:50.808
desire of the Romans to make
things look at least--

00:26:50.808 --> 00:26:53.682
or the Samnites at this point
and ultimately the Romans when

00:26:53.682 --> 00:26:56.792
they renovated this structure--
to make it look as Greek as

00:26:56.792 --> 00:26:57.349
possible.
 

00:26:57.349 --> 00:26:58.058
Yes?
 

00:26:58.058 --> 00:26:59.670
Student:  Why are the
columns chopped up?

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:01.618
Prof: Why are the
columns chopped up?

00:27:01.618 --> 00:27:04.009
You mean almost all in the same
place?

00:27:04.009 --> 00:27:08.593
These things were often pieced,
and so sometimes that can

00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:09.328
happen.
 

00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:11.647
And it's actually one of
the--you raise a very

00:27:11.647 --> 00:27:14.484
interesting issue,
because one of the things that

00:27:14.484 --> 00:27:17.058
archaeologists are beginning to
speculate,

00:27:17.058 --> 00:27:19.648
only recently about--and you
see this in some of the most

00:27:19.648 --> 00:27:21.957
recent literature--
is here we say,

00:27:21.957 --> 00:27:26.075
and I said it today,
that this city was preserved

00:27:26.075 --> 00:27:28.000
exactly as it was in 79.
 

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.320
And yet when you look at what
it looks like,

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.589
it's actually in a pretty
ruinous state.

00:27:32.589 --> 00:27:34.940
So that could mean two things.
 

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:37.589
One, that they didn't make all
that much progress in that

00:27:37.589 --> 00:27:40.411
seventeen years,
that they worked very hard but

00:27:40.411 --> 00:27:44.060
that the damage had been so
significant that they were not

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.160
able to bring these things back
as much as they had hoped to.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.140
But it also may be just the
destruction.

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:54.788
While the ash and lava covered
the city and protected it,

00:27:54.788 --> 00:27:57.250
it obviously wrought some
damage as well,

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.544
so that some of these things
obviously came down and over

00:28:01.544 --> 00:28:06.298
time the material got washed
away or taken away or whatever.

00:28:06.298 --> 00:28:09.113
But it is curious that they
sort of broke in exactly the

00:28:09.113 --> 00:28:10.999
same place,
but it's because of the

00:28:10.999 --> 00:28:13.999
construction technique and the
way in which they were pieced

00:28:13.999 --> 00:28:14.608
together.
 

00:28:14.608 --> 00:28:16.680
Student:  They would've
been &gt;.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:19.970
Prof: Yes exactly.
 

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:23.884
Let me show you another view of
the right-side wall of the

00:28:23.884 --> 00:28:24.640
Basilica.
 

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.720
You see these columns here,
again, very regular.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.880
There's a young woman standing
right here;

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.259
so that gives you a sense of
scale.

00:28:31.259 --> 00:28:35.548
She's about only up to this
point of the column.

00:28:35.548 --> 00:28:38.758
So you can see how large in
scale these were in ancient

00:28:38.758 --> 00:28:39.588
Roman times.
 

00:28:39.588 --> 00:28:42.465
But if you look at the two that
are closest to the tribunal,

00:28:42.465 --> 00:28:44.660
you will see that they have
Ionic capitals.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:48.367
So that gives us enough to go
on, to speculate that the first

00:28:48.367 --> 00:28:51.891
story of columns--and there were
two stories on the walls,

00:28:51.891 --> 00:28:53.558
two stories of columns.
 

00:28:53.558 --> 00:28:56.555
The lower ones were Ionic--and
you can see that they are

00:28:56.555 --> 00:28:58.569
attached or engaged into the
walls;

00:28:58.569 --> 00:28:59.650
those were Ionic.
 

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:03.470
And then we believe that there
was a second story that--

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:07.111
we know there was a second
story, but that the second story

00:29:07.111 --> 00:29:10.250
of columns would have been
Corinthian capitals,

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.630
up there.
 

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:15.970
This is a restored view of what
the Basilica would have looked

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:20.098
like in 120, after it was built;
120 B.C., after it was built.

00:29:20.098 --> 00:29:22.108
And you can see here the
tribunal;

00:29:22.108 --> 00:29:23.808
we're looking toward the
tribunal.

00:29:23.808 --> 00:29:26.519
It's two storied,
Corinthian order on both

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:28.038
stories, tall podium.
 

00:29:28.038 --> 00:29:32.020
We see here in black the
columns of the central space

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:35.848
that divide the center from the
two side aisles.

00:29:35.848 --> 00:29:38.961
And here you can see very well
the way in which they created

00:29:38.961 --> 00:29:41.375
two stories;
a bottom story and an upper

00:29:41.375 --> 00:29:41.808
story.
 

00:29:41.808 --> 00:29:45.804
You could walk on that upper
story, and using the Ionic

00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:50.094
capitals in the first story,
and smaller Corinthian columns

00:29:50.094 --> 00:29:51.868
in the second story.
 

00:29:51.868 --> 00:29:54.442
And it's important for me to
note, in terms of the

00:29:54.442 --> 00:29:56.375
development,
the later development of

00:29:56.375 --> 00:29:59.269
basilican architecture,
that this basilica in Pompeii,

00:29:59.269 --> 00:30:02.298
of this early date,
did not have what's called a

00:30:02.298 --> 00:30:06.913
clerestory --
c-l-e-r-e s-t-o-r-y,

00:30:06.913 --> 00:30:09.500
a clerestory.
 

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:10.680
What is a clerestory?
 

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.818
A clerestory is a series of
windows, open to the outside,

00:30:14.818 --> 00:30:17.480
that allow views out and light
in.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:20.140
This building does not have a
clerestory.

00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:22.127
So it probably,
in its heyday,

00:30:22.127 --> 00:30:25.900
in the Samnite period,
was probably on the dark side.

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.952
But we will see that
clerestory, the clerestory,

00:30:28.952 --> 00:30:32.720
is incorporated into later
Roman basilican architecture.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.598
One of the greatest buildings,
without any question,

00:30:35.598 --> 00:30:38.380
at Pompeii, and one that
everyone flocks to see--

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.798
and if you have never been to
Pompeii,

00:30:39.798 --> 00:30:43.077
let me just note that it is a
little bit further out than some

00:30:43.077 --> 00:30:47.807
of the other structures,
but it is a to-not-be-missed

00:30:47.807 --> 00:30:48.980
monument.
 

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.814
And, in fact,
I know at least one of you has

00:30:51.814 --> 00:30:55.373
already spoken to me about an
upcoming trip to Rome and

00:30:55.373 --> 00:30:58.000
Pompeii,
and consequently I just say

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.905
that you absolutely need--
you can spend days at

00:31:00.905 --> 00:31:03.069
Pompeii--but you must have a
full day,

00:31:03.069 --> 00:31:05.808
a full day, for Pompeii.
 

00:31:05.808 --> 00:31:08.238
Because in order to get to
the--not just to see the Forum

00:31:08.238 --> 00:31:10.450
and what's in the center and a
few of the houses;

00:31:10.450 --> 00:31:12.593
it doesn't take that long,
it's a nice walk,

00:31:12.593 --> 00:31:13.940
it's not a huge distance.
 

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:17.858
But people forget to do it,
because it's on the outskirts.

00:31:17.858 --> 00:31:21.284
But you really must get--the
two endpoints are the

00:31:21.284 --> 00:31:24.568
Amphitheater and the Villa of
the Mysteries,

00:31:24.568 --> 00:31:27.682
both of them absolutely
incredible to see and too often

00:31:27.682 --> 00:31:30.869
missed by tourists,
but two of the greatest sites

00:31:30.869 --> 00:31:32.460
at the city of Pompeii.
 

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:35.608
This is the Amphitheater as it
looks today from the air.

00:31:35.608 --> 00:31:39.791
The Amphitheater is one of
several buildings that were

00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:44.132
begun immediately upon the
Romans making Pompeii a Roman

00:31:44.132 --> 00:31:45.788
colony in 80 B.C.
 

00:31:45.788 --> 00:31:47.980
You can only imagine those
veterans,

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.855
those army veterans of war,
who had just been settled in

00:31:50.855 --> 00:31:54.336
their new homes,
clamoring from day one for the

00:31:54.336 --> 00:31:57.238
Amphitheater,
a place where they could go for

00:31:57.238 --> 00:31:58.950
gladiatorial and animal combat.
 

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:02.805
This is what they wanted to
see, and consequently no local

00:32:02.805 --> 00:32:06.728
magistrate or emperor worth
their salt would allow the city

00:32:06.728 --> 00:32:10.942
to continue without--
there was no emperor in 80

00:32:10.942 --> 00:32:15.696
B.C.--but would allow the city
to go on without an

00:32:15.696 --> 00:32:17.250
amphitheater.
 

00:32:17.250 --> 00:32:19.400
So that was one of the first
orders of business.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.047
This Amphitheater at Pompeii,
which dates we believe to 80 to

00:32:24.047 --> 00:32:26.310
70 B.C.,
is one--is an incredibly

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.778
important building for the
history of Roman architecture,

00:32:29.778 --> 00:32:34.519
because it is our first
preserved stone amphitheater,

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:36.788
and all the amphitheaters that
come later,

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:38.990
including the great Colosseum
in Rome,

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:41.838
are based on buildings like
this one.

00:32:41.838 --> 00:32:46.003
This was a great experiment in
amphitheater design,

00:32:46.003 --> 00:32:48.170
already in 80 to 70 B.C.
 

00:32:48.170 --> 00:32:51.868
How did they go about building
this amphitheater?

00:32:51.868 --> 00:32:56.372
What they seem to have done is
to excavate the central area,

00:32:56.372 --> 00:33:00.950
the earth of the central area,
to create a space for the oval

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:03.240
arena, which you see here.
 

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:06.317
And I've put the terms on the
Monument List for you:

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:08.250
the arena, which you see here.
 

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.436
So they've excavated that
central space,

00:33:10.436 --> 00:33:11.839
placed the arena there.
 

00:33:11.839 --> 00:33:14.368
Then they have piled up earth.
 

00:33:14.368 --> 00:33:17.028
It's essentially an earthen
bowl, is what they've created

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:18.349
here,
an earthen bowl,

00:33:18.349 --> 00:33:20.759
with the excavated space for
the arena,

00:33:20.759 --> 00:33:24.688
and then piled up the earth on
the outside to support the

00:33:24.688 --> 00:33:26.683
seats,
to support the seats,

00:33:26.683 --> 00:33:29.088
to serve as a support for the
seats.

00:33:29.088 --> 00:33:32.280
There was no natural hill here,
so they had to do this on their

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:32.588
own.
 

00:33:32.588 --> 00:33:35.440
So they build up the earth,
they place the seats--

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.348
they line that earthen bowl
with seats,

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:41.536
stone seats--and they create
the cavea of the

00:33:41.536 --> 00:33:44.237
amphitheater,
because we use the same term

00:33:44.237 --> 00:33:47.410
for the seats of an amphitheater
as for the seats of a theater.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:49.241
The cavea,
or c-a-v-e-a,

00:33:49.241 --> 00:33:51.441
the cavea,
or the seats of the

00:33:51.441 --> 00:33:52.480
amphitheater.
 

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:57.973
And you can also see here
indicated the wedge-shaped

00:33:57.973 --> 00:34:00.558
sections of the seats.
 

00:34:00.558 --> 00:34:03.903
Just as in the theater,
they are called the same thing,

00:34:03.903 --> 00:34:05.761
the cuneus,
c-u-n-e-u-s,

00:34:05.761 --> 00:34:08.550
or in the plural cunei,
c-u-n-e-i.

00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:10.809
So these wedge-shaped
individual sections,

00:34:10.809 --> 00:34:12.610
a cuneus--all of them
together,

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.563
cunei--the cunei
or wedge-shaped sections of the

00:34:16.563 --> 00:34:17.989
seats apparent here.
 

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:22.594
The exits and entrances--and
there are a couple of major ones

00:34:22.594 --> 00:34:27.429
on either side--those have a
colorful and unforgettable name.

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:29.530
I guarantee you,
you will remember this name for

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:30.650
the rest of your lives.
 

00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.889
Those exits and entrances are
called vomitoria,

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:38.969
which means they literally spit
forth spectators;

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:43.842
vomitoria,
these entrances and exits to

00:34:43.842 --> 00:34:45.900
the amphitheater.
 

00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:47.889
Let me also note that the outer
ring--

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:52.139
and the outer ring is extremely
important because it buttresses

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:55.280
the earthen bowl--
that outer ring is made of

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.869
concrete,
concrete that we'll see is

00:34:57.869 --> 00:35:00.559
faced with opus incertum
work.

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:07.280
And the entire structure is
encircled by an annular vault --

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:10.489
one of these ring vaults that
encircles the entire structure,

00:35:10.489 --> 00:35:12.750
that is made out of concrete.
 

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:17.851
So another early example of the
masterful use of concrete faced

00:35:17.851 --> 00:35:21.965
with opus incertum work,
in this case in the

00:35:21.965 --> 00:35:24.268
Amphitheater in Pompeii.
 

00:35:24.268 --> 00:35:29.063
I show you a Google Earth image
of this, which gives you a very

00:35:29.063 --> 00:35:33.469
good sense of the oval shape of
the original structure.

00:35:33.469 --> 00:35:37.043
I think it's important to
compare the exterior of the

00:35:37.043 --> 00:35:40.003
Amphitheater of Pompeii,
which is extremely well

00:35:40.003 --> 00:35:45.067
preserved, as you can see here,
with the experiment at the much

00:35:45.067 --> 00:35:51.349
earlier Sanctuary of Fortuna
Primigenia at Palestrina,

00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:55.358
where we also saw this use of
concrete faced with opus

00:35:55.358 --> 00:35:56.789
incertum work.
 

00:35:56.789 --> 00:36:00.643
If we look at the façade
of th e Amphitheater at Pompeii,

00:36:00.643 --> 00:36:04.010
we'll see first of all how
exceedingly well preserved it

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:04.500
was.
 

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:12.030
We also see this unique
staircase here,

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.081
with stairs--and I'll show you
a side view in a moment where

00:36:15.081 --> 00:36:17.954
you can see those stairs--
stairs leading up,

00:36:17.954 --> 00:36:20.170
on both sides,
to the apex.

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:25.030
And then a series of arches,
in diminishing size,

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:27.889
larger in the center and
diminishing in size as they go

00:36:27.889 --> 00:36:30.115
down the ramp,
to correspond to the shape of

00:36:30.115 --> 00:36:32.835
the ramp,
and then additional arcades

00:36:32.835 --> 00:36:33.739
over here.
 

00:36:33.739 --> 00:36:37.358
These are what are called blind
arcades, because you'll see that

00:36:37.358 --> 00:36:39.139
they have a wall in the back.
 

00:36:39.139 --> 00:36:43.300
You can't walk in these arcades
and get into the Amphitheater.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.260
There are only two
barrel-vaulted corridors--

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.050
and you saw them in the general
view--

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.489
one on either long side of the
oval,

00:36:51.489 --> 00:36:56.449
that you can actually walk in
and out of the Amphitheater from

00:36:56.449 --> 00:36:57.018
them.
 

00:36:57.018 --> 00:37:00.760
But you can go up the staircase
and enter the Amphitheater as

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.621
well from the cavea;
go up to the top and then just

00:37:04.621 --> 00:37:08.657
go at the upper most part of the
steps and walk down to your

00:37:08.657 --> 00:37:09.889
seats that way.
 

00:37:09.889 --> 00:37:12.539
So the blind arcades we can see
here.

00:37:12.539 --> 00:37:14.860
We can see that once again,
just as we saw in some of the

00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.599
other buildings we looked at
last time,

00:37:16.599 --> 00:37:19.340
the way in which they've used
opus incertum for most of

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:21.101
the wall,
the facing for the concrete for

00:37:21.101 --> 00:37:23.750
most of the wall,
but they have used stone--both

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:26.980
blocks of stone and these
voussoir blocks,

00:37:26.980 --> 00:37:30.650
wedge-shaped blocks--to
articulate the arcades,

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:36.007
to make them more prominent,
and also to give the building

00:37:36.007 --> 00:37:38.170
additional stability.
 

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.789
What's interesting here,
and one of the reasons I also

00:37:40.789 --> 00:37:43.260
bring back the Sanctuary of
Fortuna Primigenia,

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.860
is the fact that the Romans
again are giving you some

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.510
options in terms of how you get
into this building.

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.804
You can get in through the
barrel-vaulted corridors,

00:37:51.804 --> 00:37:54.969
or you can climb up this
distinctive staircase.

00:37:54.969 --> 00:37:57.144
And, by the way,
we have no other--this truly is

00:37:57.144 --> 00:38:00.016
a unique staircase--we have no
other one like it in the history

00:38:00.016 --> 00:38:01.219
of Roman architecture.
 

00:38:01.219 --> 00:38:03.079
So you have those options.
 

00:38:03.079 --> 00:38:06.740
But again, they are still
pre-determining the way in which

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.320
you go.
 

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.704
They give you a few options,
but within that scheme it is

00:38:10.704 --> 00:38:14.929
clearly a pre-determined path,
up the staircase over here,

00:38:14.929 --> 00:38:19.719
and then through only those two
barrel-vaulted corridors.

00:38:19.719 --> 00:38:23.199
And we talked about that at the
Fortuna Primigenia Sanctuary --

00:38:23.199 --> 00:38:26.639
up the ramps and then up the
staircase in the center --

00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:29.954
a very similar way of thinking
about getting people from one

00:38:29.954 --> 00:38:34.190
place to another,
in an orderly way.

00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:38.079
The staircase is so distinctive
that--and here I show you a side

00:38:38.079 --> 00:38:41.476
view of it, where you can
actually see the steps leading

00:38:41.476 --> 00:38:41.909
up.
 

00:38:41.909 --> 00:38:45.090
And if you go visit there,
you should try both options;

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:47.333
go down the corridor,
but also it's a lot of fun to

00:38:47.333 --> 00:38:49.309
go up the steps and into the
cavea.

00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:52.574
But it's so distinctive,
and never to be repeated,

00:38:52.574 --> 00:38:56.373
that when we look--there's a
painting that survives from a

00:38:56.373 --> 00:38:57.639
Pompeian house.
 

00:38:57.639 --> 00:38:59.889
We'll look at it in more detail
later in the semester,

00:38:59.889 --> 00:39:02.070
but I wanted to just show it to
you now,

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:06.528
because it is so apparent that
it is a representation of the

00:39:06.528 --> 00:39:09.728
Amphitheater at Pompeii,
which is not surprising,

00:39:09.728 --> 00:39:11.369
since this is a house in
Pompeii.

00:39:11.369 --> 00:39:13.454
But you see that distinctive
staircase here,

00:39:13.454 --> 00:39:15.637
with the steps,
the way in which you can enter

00:39:15.637 --> 00:39:16.900
into the cavea.
 

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:19.699
You get a sense of the
cavea and the kind of

00:39:19.699 --> 00:39:22.780
goings on that happened in this
Pompeii Amphitheater.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:28.059
But you can also see--this is a
very important detail that is,

00:39:28.059 --> 00:39:30.626
and this is the only place
where we actually have a

00:39:30.626 --> 00:39:33.148
representation of it--
you can see that at the upper

00:39:33.148 --> 00:39:35.639
most part of the cavea,
there is an awning,

00:39:35.639 --> 00:39:38.472
called a velarium--
and I've put that word on the

00:39:38.472 --> 00:39:41.539
Monument List for you--
an awning that was supported by

00:39:41.539 --> 00:39:44.047
poles,
that were located on brackets

00:39:44.047 --> 00:39:47.010
at the uppermost part of the
amphitheater.

00:39:47.010 --> 00:39:49.170
And that awning,
the purpose of that awning--

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.980
the Pompeiians seemed to have a
thing for protecting,

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.411
the Romans in general,
for protecting people in

00:39:54.411 --> 00:39:55.469
inclement weather.
 

00:39:55.469 --> 00:40:00.143
So they put these awnings up;
when it rained they put these

00:40:00.143 --> 00:40:05.259
awnings up to protect those who
were there to see a gladiatorial

00:40:05.259 --> 00:40:08.670
combat, to protect them from
that rain.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:12.079
One last view of the
Amphitheater of Pompeii.

00:40:12.079 --> 00:40:14.733
We are looking at its
bowl-shaped arena,

00:40:14.733 --> 00:40:18.137
as you can see here,
and the seats that do survive,

00:40:18.137 --> 00:40:20.518
to get a sense of the interior.
 

00:40:20.518 --> 00:40:24.815
Here you can see very well the
two-barrel vaulted entrances and

00:40:24.815 --> 00:40:26.456
exits,
one on either side,

00:40:26.456 --> 00:40:28.807
and that's the only way--
again those blind arcades,

00:40:28.807 --> 00:40:31.614
you can't get in that way,
and you can see that very well

00:40:31.614 --> 00:40:31.969
here.
 

00:40:31.969 --> 00:40:35.362
Those are the only entrance or
exits into the theater,

00:40:35.362 --> 00:40:36.900
besides the staircase.
 

00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:39.250
And in the introductory lecture
I made the point,

00:40:39.250 --> 00:40:41.099
and I'll just bring it back
home again,

00:40:41.099 --> 00:40:44.976
that the Yale Bowl here in New
Haven is based on the

00:40:44.976 --> 00:40:48.289
Amphitheater in Pompeii,
there's no question about that.

00:40:48.289 --> 00:40:51.239
In fact, if one goes back in
the literature on the Bowl,

00:40:51.239 --> 00:40:53.737
and its original construction,
it is even mentioned in

00:40:53.737 --> 00:40:56.518
original articles that the
architects were looking back--

00:40:56.518 --> 00:40:59.739
and I'm not making this up--the
architects were actually looking

00:40:59.739 --> 00:41:02.090
back at the Pompeii Amphitheater
as a model.

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:03.510
And you can see the
relationship.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:07.088
When you look at the Bowl from
the air, you can see it's kind

00:41:07.088 --> 00:41:09.771
of a bowl shape,
almost exactly like the shape

00:41:09.771 --> 00:41:11.679
of the Pompeii Amphitheater.
 

00:41:11.679 --> 00:41:14.311
This aerial view,
by the way, was taken at the

00:41:14.311 --> 00:41:17.293
time of the hundredth game
between Yale and Harvard,

00:41:17.293 --> 00:41:19.809
and you can see the stands were
packed.

00:41:19.809 --> 00:41:23.298
The major difference between
these two amphitheaters is the

00:41:23.298 --> 00:41:27.030
fact that the one in Pompeii was
made to hold 20,000 people.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:32.170
The one in Yale can hold up to
as many as 78,000 people.

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:34.777
So we have a larger
amphitheater,

00:41:34.777 --> 00:41:37.306
so to speak,
here than they did,

00:41:37.306 --> 00:41:40.159
and do, in the city of Pompeii.
 

00:41:40.159 --> 00:41:43.702
I want to move from the
Amphitheater to the other great

00:41:43.702 --> 00:41:46.130
entertainment district of
Pompeii,

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:50.159
and that was the Theater and
the Music Hall,

00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:51.760
the Theater and the Music Hall.
 

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:54.090
And I want to show those to you
fairly quickly.

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:58.146
We see them here in plan,
the Theater in red and the

00:41:58.146 --> 00:42:01.485
Music Hall here in a kind of,
I don't know,

00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:02.679
chartreuse.
 

00:42:02.679 --> 00:42:06.949
As you can see,
it dates to 80 to 70 B.C.

00:42:06.949 --> 00:42:10.282
-- so another example of a
building that was added when the

00:42:10.282 --> 00:42:13.329
Romans gained ascendance of this
part of the world.

00:42:13.329 --> 00:42:16.789
And a couple of terms again.
 

00:42:16.789 --> 00:42:20.182
We can see, if we look at the
Theater, we can see the fact

00:42:20.182 --> 00:42:22.682
that the Theater is
semi-circular in shape,

00:42:22.682 --> 00:42:25.659
or the cavea is
semi-circular in shape.

00:42:25.659 --> 00:42:28.690
We can see the wedge-shaped
cunei up there.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:32.005
We can also see that the
orchestra is semi-circular in

00:42:32.005 --> 00:42:34.210
shape,
not round, and that there's a

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.860
scena,
s-c-e-n-a, or a scaenae

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.304
frons,
as I called it last time,

00:42:39.304 --> 00:42:41.219
a stage building at the front.
 

00:42:41.219 --> 00:42:43.771
There is also a space over
here, which we call the

00:42:43.771 --> 00:42:46.949
porticus--and again I put
that on the Monument List for

00:42:46.949 --> 00:42:48.460
you--the porticus.
 

00:42:48.460 --> 00:42:49.369
What was the porticus?
 

00:42:49.369 --> 00:42:53.221
The porticus was an open
rectangular space with covered

00:42:53.221 --> 00:42:54.989
colonnades on either side.
 

00:42:54.989 --> 00:42:58.157
The purpose of the
porticus was to have a

00:42:58.157 --> 00:43:02.001
place where people could go
during intermission to stretch

00:43:02.001 --> 00:43:04.494
their legs,
during the intermission of the

00:43:04.494 --> 00:43:06.710
comedy or tragedy that they were
there to see.

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.193
And there were little shops
along the way,

00:43:09.193 --> 00:43:11.010
little spaces along the way.
 

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:14.280
Some of them served as shops
for playbills and other

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.039
souvenirs from the evening's
experience,

00:43:17.039 --> 00:43:21.496
but also that served as spaces
where props and scenery and

00:43:21.496 --> 00:43:25.795
costumes and all sorts of things
that were needed in the

00:43:25.795 --> 00:43:29.079
theatrical performances could be
kept.

00:43:29.079 --> 00:43:30.840
So that's the porticus.
 

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:33.420
Then over here we see the Music
Hall.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.659
It's a smaller version of the
Theater,

00:43:35.659 --> 00:43:37.679
but it's designed in exactly
the same way,

00:43:37.679 --> 00:43:41.170
with a semi-circular orchestra,
the semi-circular cavea,

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:43.820
the division into cunei,
as you can see here,

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:47.690
a small and much less elaborate
scena in the front.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:49.650
The major difference between
the two--

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:52.313
and we see this not just in
Pompeii but throughout Roman

00:43:52.313 --> 00:43:54.543
architecture--
is not just the scale,

00:43:54.543 --> 00:43:58.510
that the theater's always much
bigger than the music hall,

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.768
but that the theater was open
to the sky,

00:44:00.768 --> 00:44:04.610
and the music hall had a roof
and that roof.

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:07.889
The reason for the roof in the
smaller music hall,

00:44:07.889 --> 00:44:09.489
and the reason for the smaller
size,

00:44:09.489 --> 00:44:14.510
was to make the acoustics as
good as they could possibly be,

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:17.623
and that was easier to do in a
roofed building and in a

00:44:17.623 --> 00:44:19.239
building of smaller scale.
 

00:44:19.239 --> 00:44:21.722
A Google Earth view of the
Theater and Music Hall,

00:44:21.722 --> 00:44:24.409
as they look today--and you can
see they're quite well

00:44:24.409 --> 00:44:27.125
preserved;
you can see the exact shapes

00:44:27.125 --> 00:44:29.920
that you looked at in plan over
there.

00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.579
Here's our porticus,
for example.

00:44:31.579 --> 00:44:34.568
You can get a sense of how
pleasant that might be able to

00:44:34.568 --> 00:44:36.170
be during intermission time.
 

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:38.565
What this view also gives you a
sense of, however,

00:44:38.565 --> 00:44:41.402
is the way in which these two
buildings are embedded in the

00:44:41.402 --> 00:44:43.789
rest of the city;
they do make up an

00:44:43.789 --> 00:44:47.735
entertainment district,
but at the same time they are

00:44:47.735 --> 00:44:52.061
very close to the city streets
that have along them houses and

00:44:52.061 --> 00:44:54.329
shops and so on and so forth.
 

00:44:54.329 --> 00:44:56.949
So very closely embedded into
the life,

00:44:56.949 --> 00:44:59.230
into the commercial life and
the residential life,

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:01.661
of the city,
even though this was intended

00:45:01.661 --> 00:45:05.460
again as a great entertainment
area for those who lived there.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:08.380
And I made this point before,
but I'll make it quickly again,

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:11.559
that while Roman theaters,
like the Theater at Pompeii,

00:45:11.559 --> 00:45:14.730
are based on Greek prototypes,
there are some differences.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:18.536
The two theaters--this is the
Greek Theater at Epidaurus in

00:45:18.536 --> 00:45:20.440
the mid-fourth century B.C.
 

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.934
They both have the stone seats;
they both have--which is called

00:45:23.934 --> 00:45:26.925
the cavea--they both have
these wedge-shaped sections of

00:45:26.925 --> 00:45:28.483
seats;
they both have a stage

00:45:28.483 --> 00:45:31.039
building, although the Greek one
is much simpler.

00:45:31.039 --> 00:45:35.143
But the major differences
between the two is that the

00:45:35.143 --> 00:45:38.460
Greek theater has a circular
orchestra,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.570
whereas the Roman theater has
a--and this is the Theater of

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:44.619
Pompeii--
has a semicircular orchestra.

00:45:44.619 --> 00:45:47.572
And the other major difference,
the most significant one,

00:45:47.572 --> 00:45:50.052
is the Greeks built their
theaters on hillsides,

00:45:50.052 --> 00:45:51.739
as you can see at Epidaurus.
 

00:45:51.739 --> 00:45:56.307
The Romans built their
theaters--and this is the case

00:45:56.307 --> 00:46:00.349
in Pompeii-- on a hill made out
of concrete.

00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:03.268
I want to turn to an extremely
important building,

00:46:03.268 --> 00:46:07.019
and one that I am going to come
back to on a number of occasions

00:46:07.019 --> 00:46:08.510
during this semester.
 

00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:12.677
So put an asterisk next to this
one as a particularly important

00:46:12.677 --> 00:46:16.375
building and one that it's
almost certain I'll find some

00:46:16.375 --> 00:46:19.670
way of incorporating into the
first midterm,

00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:21.719
because I think it's so
significant,

00:46:21.719 --> 00:46:25.572
and it will turn up again and
again and again in the course of

00:46:25.572 --> 00:46:27.666
the term,
especially when we talk about

00:46:27.666 --> 00:46:28.820
later bath architecture.
 

00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:31.250
It is the Stabian Baths of
Pompeii.

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:34.818
It dates to the second half of
the second century B.C.,

00:46:34.818 --> 00:46:38.650
and it was remodeled in the
first half of the first century

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:39.179
B.C.
 

00:46:39.179 --> 00:46:43.192
The Stabian Baths are one of
several bath buildings at

00:46:43.192 --> 00:46:43.949
Pompeii.
 

00:46:43.949 --> 00:46:47.876
I mentioned in the introductory
lecture that these houses in

00:46:47.876 --> 00:46:51.737
Pompeii did not have running
water and so access to bathing

00:46:51.737 --> 00:46:55.400
and to water for daily use was
obviously critical,

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.186
and the baths served that
purpose, the place where one

00:46:58.186 --> 00:46:59.289
could go and bathe.
 

00:46:59.289 --> 00:47:02.170
But they were also--they also
became great social centers,

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:04.757
great places where you really
wanted to go and hang out with

00:47:04.757 --> 00:47:06.860
your friends,
while you were sitting in the

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:07.199
sauna.
 

00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:10.947
And so they take on a
very--they are a very important

00:47:10.947 --> 00:47:13.760
piece of life in cities like
Pompeii.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.436
The Stabian Baths,
as their date indicates,

00:47:16.436 --> 00:47:17.518
are very early.
 

00:47:17.518 --> 00:47:20.302
They're begun already under the
Samnites, and they have some

00:47:20.302 --> 00:47:21.860
extremely interesting features.
 

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:25.568
And once again I'm going to
have to go over some of the bath

00:47:25.568 --> 00:47:26.449
terminology.
 

00:47:26.449 --> 00:47:29.507
You can see here that if you
walk along the street,

00:47:29.507 --> 00:47:32.934
you just see a series of
cubicles, which served as shops,

00:47:32.934 --> 00:47:34.768
so fairly unprepossessing.
 

00:47:34.768 --> 00:47:38.554
But there is an entranceway
through those shops into a very

00:47:38.554 --> 00:47:41.391
large open space,
surrounded by columns on three

00:47:41.391 --> 00:47:42.827
sides,
that is called the

00:47:42.827 --> 00:47:44.599
palaestra of the baths.
 

00:47:44.599 --> 00:47:46.480
The palaestra was the
exercise courts,

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:50.940
where you jogged and ran around
and so on,

00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:53.280
and after you exerted yourself
and got all sweaty,

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.030
you could jump into the pool,
that was located over here.

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:59.766
This was not a place to do
laps, it was pretty much a

00:47:59.766 --> 00:48:02.400
soaking pool or a pool where you
could cool off.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.539
But the technical term for that
is either a piscina,

00:48:06.539 --> 00:48:08.530
which is what's on the Monument
List for you,

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:11.190
or a natatio,
n-a-t-a-t-i-o,

00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:14.505
a little pool where you could
splash yourself after exerting

00:48:14.505 --> 00:48:17.260
yourself by exercising in the
palaestra.

00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:21.550
The bath block itself,
the bathing rooms themselves,

00:48:21.550 --> 00:48:24.670
are located on the other side
of the plan,

00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:27.590
on the right side,
as you see it here,

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:30.590
the northern side actually,
of the plan.

00:48:30.590 --> 00:48:34.201
And we see two sets of spaces:
this set of four down here,

00:48:34.201 --> 00:48:36.989
this one, this one,
this one and this one;

00:48:36.989 --> 00:48:40.630
and then a set of a comparable
number of rooms up there.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:43.864
These early Roman baths,
there was a separation between

00:48:43.864 --> 00:48:47.460
the men's section of the baths
and the women's section of the

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.059
baths.
 

00:48:48.059 --> 00:48:50.739
And I'm sorry,
ladies, but we'll have to

00:48:50.739 --> 00:48:54.793
accept the fact that at least in
ancient Pompeii the women's

00:48:54.793 --> 00:48:57.130
section was quite nondescript.
 

00:48:57.130 --> 00:48:58.900
It was much smaller than the
men's--

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.550
at least they had one,
thank goodness--

00:49:00.550 --> 00:49:03.760
but it was smaller than the
men's, and the rooms had no

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.079
architectural distinction
whatsoever.

00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:10.541
All of the designer's effort
went into creating a wonderful

00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:12.619
set of rooms for the men.
 

00:49:12.619 --> 00:49:15.492
We see the men's rooms again
over here, these four,

00:49:15.492 --> 00:49:17.159
and the women's at the top.
 

00:49:17.159 --> 00:49:20.889
Consequently the only ones that
have any merit architecturally,

00:49:20.889 --> 00:49:23.896
in my showing you today,
are the ones for the men's

00:49:23.896 --> 00:49:25.159
baths, down here.
 

00:49:25.159 --> 00:49:28.063
The four rooms,
the four key rooms to both the

00:49:28.063 --> 00:49:30.422
men's and women's sections,
were the

00:49:30.422 --> 00:49:33.592
apodyterium--and again
these words are on the Monument

00:49:33.592 --> 00:49:35.697
List for you--
the apodyterium,

00:49:35.697 --> 00:49:37.219
which was the dressing room.
 

00:49:37.219 --> 00:49:40.885
It's a fairly--again,
it's large, but a fairly

00:49:40.885 --> 00:49:43.900
nondescript, rectangular room
here.

00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:45.289
You can see it right down here.
 

00:49:45.289 --> 00:49:48.710
And the way it was designed was
that you went in,

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:50.670
and there were no lockers,
no private lockers,

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:53.059
but there were benches where
you could,

00:49:53.059 --> 00:49:55.233
when you got undressed,
you could just take your

00:49:55.233 --> 00:49:57.730
clothes and put them in a little
pile on that bench.

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.443
You had to just take on faith
that no one was going to steal

00:50:00.443 --> 00:50:02.557
any of your belongings,
and if you were very

00:50:02.557 --> 00:50:04.809
well-to-do, some of the very
well-to-do Romans,

00:50:04.809 --> 00:50:07.079
men and women,
brought slaves with them,

00:50:07.079 --> 00:50:09.172
their slave,
their private slave,

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:13.034
to watch their stuff while they
were in the sauna with their

00:50:13.034 --> 00:50:13.820
friends.
 

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.630
From the apodyterium you
go into the so-called

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:19.586
tepidarium of the baths,
also usually a plain

00:50:19.586 --> 00:50:21.922
rectangular room,
even in the men's section,

00:50:21.922 --> 00:50:25.193
which served as the warm room,
where you started to warm

00:50:25.193 --> 00:50:26.079
yourself up.
 

00:50:26.079 --> 00:50:28.344
You went from the
tepidarium into the

00:50:28.344 --> 00:50:31.963
caldarium of the bath,
which was the hot room,

00:50:31.963 --> 00:50:35.291
where you really--
it was the sauna essentially of

00:50:35.291 --> 00:50:35.849
the bath.
 

00:50:35.849 --> 00:50:40.382
And consequently there was a
basin over here with cold water,

00:50:40.382 --> 00:50:43.780
so if you got too hot,
you could go and splash

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.349
yourself with that cold water.
 

00:50:46.349 --> 00:50:48.376
So apodyterium,
tepidarium,

00:50:48.376 --> 00:50:49.340
caldarium.
 

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.398
By then you're really heated up
and you can make your way back

00:50:52.398 --> 00:50:54.603
into this room over here,
which is called the

00:50:54.603 --> 00:50:56.659
frigidarium,
or the cold room.

00:50:56.659 --> 00:51:00.059
The frigidarium was the
place that you could really cool

00:51:00.059 --> 00:51:00.389
off.
 

00:51:00.389 --> 00:51:02.869
And I think you can see by
looking at these,

00:51:02.869 --> 00:51:05.018
the two most important rooms
architecturally--

00:51:05.018 --> 00:51:07.699
you can see this even in
plan--are the caldarium,

00:51:07.699 --> 00:51:11.599
which has an apse or curved
element at the end,

00:51:11.599 --> 00:51:14.590
and this room in particular,
the frigidarium,

00:51:14.590 --> 00:51:18.590
because it is a round structure
with radiating alcoves--

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:20.309
and we're going to see that
it's domed.

00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:23.179
This is a particularly--again
star,

00:51:23.179 --> 00:51:25.800
star, star, star -- one of the
most important rooms that I've

00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.735
shown you,
probably the most important

00:51:27.735 --> 00:51:30.010
room I've shown you thus far
this semester,

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.567
in that it is going to have a
very long future

00:51:32.567 --> 00:51:33.590
architecturally.
 

00:51:33.590 --> 00:51:36.369
What you see here basically
ends up as the Pantheon,

00:51:36.369 --> 00:51:39.590
some day: this round space,
round structure,

00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:41.579
with radiating alcoves and,
as we'll see,

00:51:41.579 --> 00:51:44.139
a dome, and not only a dome,
but a hole in the ceiling,

00:51:44.139 --> 00:51:46.751
an oculus,
that allows light into the

00:51:46.751 --> 00:51:47.480
structure.
 

00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:51.639
How were these baths heated,
how were the hot rooms heated?

00:51:51.639 --> 00:51:53.380
Through a system called a
hypocaust;

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:57.059
again I've put the word on the
Monument List for you,

00:51:57.059 --> 00:51:59.889
a hypocaust,
h-y-p-o-c-a-u-s-t.

00:51:59.889 --> 00:52:01.260
What was a hypocaust
system?

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:06.275
A hypocaust system was a
system by which they put

00:52:06.275 --> 00:52:11.110
terracotta tubes in the floor
and behind the walls.

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:15.097
They blew hot air into those,
and they also raised up the

00:52:15.097 --> 00:52:18.231
pavement of the floor,
on a series of stacked

00:52:18.231 --> 00:52:21.579
tiles--and you can see that
extremely well;

00:52:21.579 --> 00:52:23.994
here's a very well-preserved
hypocaust from the

00:52:23.994 --> 00:52:26.713
Stabian Baths--
placed these tiles on stacks,

00:52:26.713 --> 00:52:29.996
stacks of tiles,
leaving space in between them,

00:52:29.996 --> 00:52:33.891
and put braziers between those,
metal braziers,

00:52:33.891 --> 00:52:38.619
metal bowls,
that held hot coals and so on.

00:52:38.619 --> 00:52:41.956
And from those hot coals--they
obviously had slaves who had to

00:52:41.956 --> 00:52:47.088
keep those coals hot--
but coals that were placed in

00:52:47.088 --> 00:52:51.480
these pans,
that helped also to heat the

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.639
pavement that was located above.
 

00:52:54.639 --> 00:52:58.764
This very important room,
the frigidarium of the

00:52:58.764 --> 00:53:01.894
Stabian Baths,
you see it here as it looks

00:53:01.894 --> 00:53:04.340
today: a small,
round space.

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:07.639
It would have had a pool in the
center,

00:53:07.639 --> 00:53:10.572
a round pool,
radiating alcoves,

00:53:10.572 --> 00:53:13.228
a dome,
a dome that is open to the sky,

00:53:13.228 --> 00:53:15.929
with an oculus that
allows light into it.

00:53:15.929 --> 00:53:19.342
You can see the remains of
paint, stucco and then paint,

00:53:19.342 --> 00:53:21.885
blue and red,
paint, probably some kind of

00:53:21.885 --> 00:53:23.809
marine scene included here.
 

00:53:23.809 --> 00:53:27.713
But this, I can't underscore
enough the importance of this

00:53:27.713 --> 00:53:31.824
particular room and the future
that this design has for Roman

00:53:31.824 --> 00:53:32.989
architecture.
 

00:53:32.989 --> 00:53:36.710
I'd like to show you another
bath at Pompeii,

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:39.079
the so-called Forum Baths.
 

00:53:39.079 --> 00:53:41.159
The Forum Baths are interesting
because they're later.

00:53:41.159 --> 00:53:43.449
They date to,
as you can see from your

00:53:43.449 --> 00:53:45.119
Monument List,
to 80 B.C.

00:53:45.119 --> 00:53:48.485
So this is what the Romans did
when they came in and took over

00:53:48.485 --> 00:53:51.739
Pompeii and were making it into
one of those mini-Romes,

00:53:51.739 --> 00:53:56.960
those cities in the model of
Rome.

00:53:56.960 --> 00:54:00.746
And you can see it's very,
very similar to what was going

00:54:00.746 --> 00:54:04.331
on in the Stabian Baths,
in the earlier Samnite baths,

00:54:04.331 --> 00:54:08.166
with the same palaestra;
we see a palaestra up at

00:54:08.166 --> 00:54:10.050
2;
the exercise court.

00:54:10.050 --> 00:54:12.657
We don't seem to have a
natatio in this

00:54:12.657 --> 00:54:13.699
particular plan.
 

00:54:13.699 --> 00:54:16.969
We see the men's section over
here, at 3,4,

00:54:16.969 --> 00:54:20.239
5 and 6, and the women's
section over here,

00:54:20.239 --> 00:54:21.329
7,8, 9,10.
 

00:54:21.329 --> 00:54:25.342
Again, the women's section off
to the side, of no architectural

00:54:25.342 --> 00:54:26.960
distinction whatsoever.
 

00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:29.567
The men's over here,
and you could enter the men's

00:54:29.567 --> 00:54:31.961
either through the
palaestra or from an

00:54:31.961 --> 00:54:33.400
opening over here at 1.
 

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.387
We see the same set of rooms
that we saw at the Stabian

00:54:36.387 --> 00:54:36.829
Baths.
 

00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:41.146
We see the apodyterium
or undressing and dressing room

00:54:41.146 --> 00:54:42.369
over here at 3.
 

00:54:42.369 --> 00:54:46.159
The tepidarium at 5,
the caldarium at 6,

00:54:46.159 --> 00:54:48.936
and the caldarium at 6
is of the same shape as the

00:54:48.936 --> 00:54:50.969
caldarium in the Stabian
Baths,

00:54:50.969 --> 00:54:56.807
a rectangular room with an apse
at the end and a basin for cold

00:54:56.807 --> 00:54:58.409
water splashes.
 

00:54:58.409 --> 00:55:00.730
And then you go back again to
the frigidarium,

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:03.110
and you can see the
frigidarium in the baths,

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:06.757
Forum Baths at Pompeii -- the
same shape as that in the

00:55:06.757 --> 00:55:10.943
Stabian Baths at Pompeii,
a small round room with

00:55:10.943 --> 00:55:12.840
radiating alcoves.
 

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.989
I can show you views both of
the tepidarium of the

00:55:16.989 --> 00:55:21.510
Forum Baths, extremely well
preserved, as you can see here.

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:25.034
You can also see they've used a
great barrel vault for this

00:55:25.034 --> 00:55:25.460
room.
 

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:28.340
It isn't as large as it looks
here, but it's a sizable room.

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:32.510
And this is a very good place
to show you by the way,

00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:34.630
to give you a sense of how
these things were decorated,

00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:38.210
how so many rooms -- Roman
buildings today,

00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:40.340
are stripped of their original
decoration.

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:43.355
But that decoration was often
quite beautiful and

00:55:43.355 --> 00:55:45.427
ostentatious,
and we can see here,

00:55:45.427 --> 00:55:47.690
we can get here a sense of
that.

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.440
You can see the wall has been
stuccoed over,

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:54.186
and then also in stucco these
great flowering acanthus plants

00:55:54.186 --> 00:55:58.184
and creatures flying above --
animals, human feature,

00:55:58.184 --> 00:56:00.400
gods and goddesses flying
above.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.867
They used paint as well,
red and blue and white and

00:56:03.867 --> 00:56:06.710
other colors,
to accentuate the design.

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:08.730
This gives you some sense of
the flavor of these.

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:12.554
And then this wonderful detail
below of these Atlas figures who

00:56:12.554 --> 00:56:16.070
are shown holding up the vault
of this particular room.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:19.041
It gives you some sense of why
Romans flocked to these places

00:56:19.041 --> 00:56:20.391
--
not only because it was the

00:56:20.391 --> 00:56:22.139
only place they could bathe
themselves,

00:56:22.139 --> 00:56:25.606
but also because it was just a
wonderful space to be in and to

00:56:25.606 --> 00:56:27.710
enjoy again the company of
friends.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:32.929
This is a view of what room,
in the Forum Baths?

00:56:32.929 --> 00:56:33.409
Student:  The
caldarium.

00:56:33.409 --> 00:56:35.157
Prof: The
caldarium--

00:56:35.157 --> 00:56:37.469
excellent--the caldarium
over here,

00:56:37.469 --> 00:56:41.672
with its rectangular shape and
then its apse and its basin for

00:56:41.672 --> 00:56:43.190
cold water splashes.
 

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:45.670
And then look at the ceiling,
how wonderful.

00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:49.632
In that apse you see a
semi-dome, a round hole or an

00:56:49.632 --> 00:56:54.139
oculus in that semi-dome,
to allow light into it.

00:56:54.139 --> 00:56:57.175
So here we see them exploring
oculi in semi-domes,

00:56:57.175 --> 00:56:58.369
as well as in domes.
 

00:56:58.369 --> 00:57:02.123
And then the square and
rectangular spaces:

00:57:02.123 --> 00:57:05.786
holes in the ceiling,
openings in the ceiling that

00:57:05.786 --> 00:57:09.036
have been placed there also to
allow light into the system so

00:57:09.036 --> 00:57:12.400
that you could use the room,
but also to create the kind of

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.518
wonderful light effects that it
does,

00:57:14.518 --> 00:57:18.759
when you have rays of sunshine
coming in on you while you are

00:57:18.759 --> 00:57:19.889
in your sauna.
 

00:57:19.889 --> 00:57:25.260
This is a couple of views of
the frigidarium of the

00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:26.579
Forum Baths.
 

00:57:26.579 --> 00:57:31.460
You can see a dome up above,
the oculus in that dome.

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.840
You can see some of the stucco
decorations still preserved.

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.230
You can see the alcoves here,
the radiating alcoves,

00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:39.103
and some of the stuccoed
decoration here:

00:57:39.103 --> 00:57:41.119
sea creatures against a red
background.

00:57:41.119 --> 00:57:43.759
And this is a restored view of
what the frigidarium

00:57:43.759 --> 00:57:46.260
would have looked like,
with the pool in the center;

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:47.949
a nice place to relax.
 

00:57:47.949 --> 00:57:52.289
The radiating apses over here,
and then the dome with the

00:57:52.289 --> 00:57:56.010
oculus and with the light
streaming in.

00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:59.501
Again, I can't underscore
enough the importance of both of

00:57:59.501 --> 00:58:03.360
these frigidaria for the
future of Roman architecture.

00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:06.431
The other importance of the
Forum Baths is the Forum Baths

00:58:06.431 --> 00:58:09.235
is today where you can eat,
and if you're there for the

00:58:09.235 --> 00:58:10.500
full day,
as I recommend you be,

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.059
you're going to want to eat at
some point,

00:58:12.059 --> 00:58:14.800
and there is a cafeteria,
which doesn't look like much

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.610
but actually the food is not
bad.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:19.289
The Italians have a very hard
time making bad pasta.

00:58:19.289 --> 00:58:22.271
So you can always get some good
pasta at the snack bar and you

00:58:22.271 --> 00:58:25.161
will want to make your way--
there's a few views of it--make

00:58:25.161 --> 00:58:27.916
your way to the Forum Baths,
if you're there for any length

00:58:27.916 --> 00:58:28.329
of time.
 

00:58:28.329 --> 00:58:30.619
Very quickly I just want to
remind you--

00:58:30.619 --> 00:58:32.500
we talked about this in the
introductory lecture--

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.576
that one of the main reasons
that Pompeii is so interesting

00:58:35.576 --> 00:58:39.130
to us today is because it tells
us so much about the daily life,

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:41.929
not only of the Pompeians,
but of the Romans in general,

00:58:41.929 --> 00:58:45.338
because we have all these
wonderful shops still preserved

00:58:45.338 --> 00:58:46.130
at Pompeii.
 

00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:48.239
This was a bakery.
 

00:58:48.239 --> 00:58:51.038
We see the millstones that were
actually used for the grinding

00:58:51.038 --> 00:58:52.460
of the grain still preserved.
 

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:55.704
We see the oven over here,
looking wonderfully like a

00:58:55.704 --> 00:58:57.949
modern pizza oven,
as you can see.

00:58:57.949 --> 00:59:00.112
And we also,
believe it or not,

00:59:00.112 --> 00:59:04.150
have from Pompeii a petrified
bread--it's preserved--that

00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:08.260
gives you a sense of what
Pompeian bread looked like.

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:13.025
And it looks strikingly like
our pizzas, with the segments of

00:59:13.025 --> 00:59:13.980
the bread.
 

00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.547
So if you want to have a sense
of where pizza came from--I told

00:59:16.547 --> 00:59:18.204
you the Romans,
again there's nothing the

00:59:18.204 --> 00:59:20.500
Romans didn't invent;
bread, pizza, whatever.

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:23.724
But you see that petrified
bread, giving you a very good

00:59:23.724 --> 00:59:26.949
sense of what was produced in
this particular bakery.

00:59:26.949 --> 00:59:29.208
I also mentioned in the
introductory lecture the

00:59:29.208 --> 00:59:32.302
fast-food stands of Pompeii;
the thermopolium in the

00:59:32.302 --> 00:59:34.561
singular, or the
thermopolia in the

00:59:34.561 --> 00:59:37.922
plural, these fast-food stands
where you could get a bite real

00:59:37.922 --> 00:59:38.639
quickly.
 

00:59:38.639 --> 00:59:42.264
The way they were designed was
to have a great counter in them,

00:59:42.264 --> 00:59:43.199
with recesses.
 

00:59:43.199 --> 00:59:46.920
Fresh hot and cold food was put
out obviously every day,

00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:49.550
and if you were hungry you just
went up to the counter,

00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:51.485
you took a peek at what was
there, you pointed out what you

00:59:51.485 --> 00:59:53.760
wanted,
and you could eat on the run.

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:57.487
The Romans were never to have
their state religion and their

00:59:57.487 --> 01:00:01.215
family religion far from them,
and you can also see a nod to

01:00:01.215 --> 01:00:02.670
the gods over here.
 

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:05.911
There's a shrine with some of
the representations of the

01:00:05.911 --> 01:00:08.092
household gods,
even in this fast-food

01:00:08.092 --> 01:00:08.860
emporium.
 

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.510
We have wine shops from Pompeii
as well.

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:14.634
I show you actually a scene of
one of the storage rooms at

01:00:14.634 --> 01:00:17.650
Pompeii that you can see
actually as you walk along--

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:20.880
it's a wonderful ruffling,
turning to the next page--

01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:26.456
these wine, these amphoras,
these great clay amphoras that

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:27.630
held wine.
 

01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:31.032
They're located in one of these
storage areas that one can see

01:00:31.032 --> 01:00:33.597
as one walks along the Forum,
on the left side,

01:00:33.597 --> 01:00:34.768
in Pompeii today.
 

01:00:34.768 --> 01:00:39.157
But you can imagine these on
shelves in a wine shop of

01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:42.724
ancient Pompeii,
offering wines gathered from

01:00:42.724 --> 01:00:47.434
all over the world,
for discerning oenophiles--is

01:00:47.434 --> 01:00:50.650
that the word?-- oenophiles.
 

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:54.509
Connecting all of these shops
to one another were of course

01:00:54.509 --> 01:00:56.239
the streets of the city.
 

01:00:56.239 --> 01:00:58.659
The streets of the city are
extremely well preserved.

01:00:58.659 --> 01:01:01.610
I show you here a couple of
views of the crossing of the

01:01:01.610 --> 01:01:04.400
cardo and the
decumanus in Pompeii,

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.340
and you can see exactly what
the streets looked like.

01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:12.150
You can see the multi-sided
paving stones of the streets.

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:15.860
You can see the sidewalks
looking uncannily modern.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:19.309
You can see--you can't see
exactly here -- but there are

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:22.445
drains along the way,
to allow rain water to filter

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:23.699
off the streets.
 

01:01:23.699 --> 01:01:28.280
And all of this again an
extremely modern look.

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.909
And the streets of Pompeii give
us the best sense,

01:01:30.909 --> 01:01:34.619
of any streets of any preserved
ancient city,

01:01:34.619 --> 01:01:39.268
of what the streets looked like
in any given Roman town.

01:01:39.268 --> 01:01:42.588
These streets had along
them--again because of needs for

01:01:42.588 --> 01:01:44.639
water--had along them fountains.
 

01:01:44.639 --> 01:01:48.277
Here's a very modest fountain
where we see a representation of

01:01:48.277 --> 01:01:50.639
the goddess Ceres,
c-e-r-e-s, Ceres,

01:01:50.639 --> 01:01:54.492
with her cornucopia and the
fountain spout coming out of her

01:01:54.492 --> 01:01:55.079
mouth.
 

01:01:55.079 --> 01:01:58.440
And you can see this is the
sort of thing,

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.474
when the Romans just needed a
little bit of water for

01:02:00.474 --> 01:02:02.385
household use,
they would go out to the local

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:02.800
fountain.
 

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.621
So as you walk along the
streets of Pompeii,

01:02:04.621 --> 01:02:06.360
you see a lot of these small
fountains.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.762
You also see graffiti;
what would a city be without

01:02:08.762 --> 01:02:10.000
some graffiti on its buildings?
 

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.922
Any of you who've been in Rome
recently know there is too much

01:02:12.922 --> 01:02:13.449
graffiti.
 

01:02:13.449 --> 01:02:15.869
There's like a graffiti craze.
 

01:02:15.869 --> 01:02:17.762
The Romans have always had a
lot of graffiti,

01:02:17.762 --> 01:02:21.889
but it's gotten so bad;
it's almost unimaginable now.

01:02:21.889 --> 01:02:25.067
But the graffiti tradition was
alive and well in Pompeii,

01:02:25.067 --> 01:02:27.449
and you see it here,
covered with glass.

01:02:27.449 --> 01:02:28.710
But you see it here.
 

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:32.110
You see it here and there in
the city as you wander by,

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:35.233
and it gives you a sense that
people did write right on their

01:02:35.233 --> 01:02:37.327
buildings,
these--what they wrote on these

01:02:37.327 --> 01:02:38.929
buildings tended to be
political,

01:02:38.929 --> 01:02:39.820
for the most part.
 

01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:44.532
And you'd see graffiti that
would say things like "Vote

01:02:44.532 --> 01:02:47.090
for Barbatus,
the bearded one;

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:50.556
he'll be the best guy for the
office, and he's pretty handsome

01:02:50.556 --> 01:02:51.239
too."
 

01:02:51.239 --> 01:02:54.867
That's the kind of graffiti
that you'll see as you walk

01:02:54.867 --> 01:02:58.295
along--if your Latin is
good--that you'll see as you

01:02:58.295 --> 01:03:00.849
walk along the streets of
Pompeii.

01:03:00.849 --> 01:03:04.409
You'll also see these big
blocks of stone.

01:03:04.409 --> 01:03:06.860
And there are people who look
at these and they think,

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:08.851
"Oh how interesting,
that's debris from

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:09.730
Vesuvius."
 

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:12.690
It's not debris from Vesuvius,
clearly.

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:14.400
These are there deliberately.
 

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.110
These are stepping stones.
 

01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:18.831
The Romans were so ingenious,
and so again concerned about

01:03:18.831 --> 01:03:21.030
how to protect people in
inclement weather,

01:03:21.030 --> 01:03:23.969
that they created,
they put these stepping stones

01:03:23.969 --> 01:03:26.597
all around the city,
usually at the cross-sections

01:03:26.597 --> 01:03:27.268
of two streets.
 

01:03:27.268 --> 01:03:30.423
So if there was torrential
rain, and if the water had piled

01:03:30.423 --> 01:03:33.090
up and if the drains couldn't
quite handle it,

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:37.050
you could get across the street
without stepping in the water.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:39.672
And would that we had this,
in the slushiness that was New

01:03:39.672 --> 01:03:40.869
Haven, in the last week.
 

01:03:40.869 --> 01:03:43.137
I can't tell you how many times
I think, "Why doesn't Yale

01:03:43.137 --> 01:03:43.980
have stepping stones?
 

01:03:43.980 --> 01:03:45.800
We really could use them."
 

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.815
But here they are,
and you see very clearly the

01:03:48.815 --> 01:03:52.422
ruts that come from the carts
that were made between the

01:03:52.422 --> 01:03:55.304
stepping stones,
by those carts constantly

01:03:55.304 --> 01:03:56.570
riding through them.
 

01:03:56.570 --> 01:03:59.913
And it shows you that they had
to orchestrate the wheels of the

01:03:59.913 --> 01:04:03.309
carts in such a way that they
would span the stepping stones.

01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:05.030
But it's a very ingenious thing.
 

01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:07.347
They're fun to look at,
fun to walk on,

01:04:07.347 --> 01:04:09.360
really fun to take pictures of.
 

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:09.820
I have tons of them.
 

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:12.318
I didn't--I decided not to
bring a personal picture this

01:04:12.318 --> 01:04:15.090
time of me or anyone else in my
family on stepping stones,

01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:17.030
or other Yalies,
I've got lots of those too.

01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:19.731
I didn't bring those today,
but I did bring something I'm

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:23.222
really proud of,
because in all the years I've

01:04:23.222 --> 01:04:27.074
taught this city,
I've always wanted to actually

01:04:27.074 --> 01:04:30.320
show what it looked like when it
had rained.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.398
And since I've been to Pompeii
so, so many times over the

01:04:34.398 --> 01:04:38.260
years, but it doesn't tend to
rain when I go there;

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:40.369
June, July, August,
it just doesn't rain.

01:04:40.369 --> 01:04:41.760
So I've never been able to do
that.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:44.434
I was there this past June and
lo and behold--I was very upset

01:04:44.434 --> 01:04:46.889
because who wants to wander
around the city of Pompeii in

01:04:46.889 --> 01:04:47.460
the rain?
 

01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:50.052
But I had one day to go there
and I was there and I said,

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:52.369
"Wow, it's raining,
here's my chance."

01:04:52.369 --> 01:04:55.630
So I finally was able to get
some views of what happens--

01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:58.088
and this was right--we had a
torrential rain for about a half

01:04:58.088 --> 01:04:59.909
an hour,
and then the sun came out.

01:04:59.909 --> 01:05:02.130
And this is what you see as you
wander the streets.

01:05:02.130 --> 01:05:03.989
You see that the water has
accumulated,

01:05:03.989 --> 01:05:06.780
but again, lo and behold,
you can easily make your way

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.063
across that street,
across those stepping stones

01:05:10.063 --> 01:05:11.050
nonetheless.
 

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:15.155
Just a very few words on what
happens to the streets of the

01:05:15.155 --> 01:05:17.815
city of Pompeii,
or any Roman city for that

01:05:17.815 --> 01:05:21.003
matter, when you leave the gates
and you go out on the intercity

01:05:21.003 --> 01:05:21.460
roads.
 

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:24.210
Many of those intercity roads
become cemeteries.

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:26.969
The Romans used these roads as
their cemeteries.

01:05:26.969 --> 01:05:30.394
The Romans had a religious
belief that there was a

01:05:30.394 --> 01:05:34.590
separation between the city of
the living and the city of the

01:05:34.590 --> 01:05:35.219
dead.
 

01:05:35.219 --> 01:05:39.130
So all of the tombs are outside
the walls of the city.

01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:42.958
So you see at Pompeii two
extremely well-preserved tomb

01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:45.980
streets,
the Street of the Tombs and the

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:48.603
Via Nucera--
which is the one you see here,

01:05:48.603 --> 01:05:51.179
n-u-c-e-r-a--
with tombs of all sorts of

01:05:51.179 --> 01:05:52.420
shapes and sizes.
 

01:05:52.420 --> 01:05:55.489
I'm not going to go into these
in any detail in this course.

01:05:55.489 --> 01:05:58.873
There is a paper topic for any
of you who get interested in

01:05:58.873 --> 01:06:01.440
tomb architecture on the tombs
of Pompeii.

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.922
We will look at some tombs in
Rome, in great detail,

01:06:03.922 --> 01:06:06.650
but I'm just going to give you
a glimpse of them here.

01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:08.579
They come in all sizes and
shapes.

01:06:08.579 --> 01:06:09.800
They're very, very interesting.
 

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.059
They honor the people who are
buried there,

01:06:12.059 --> 01:06:14.400
including--there's a bench
tomb, for example,

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:18.242
where you can sit and think on
the life and times of the

01:06:18.242 --> 01:06:20.619
individual who was buried there.
 

01:06:20.619 --> 01:06:24.327
So an absolutely fascinating,
fascinating street,

01:06:24.327 --> 01:06:28.806
with a lot of different tomb
types that show the variety of

01:06:28.806 --> 01:06:31.820
tomb architecture under the
Romans.

01:06:31.820 --> 01:06:39.646
I'd like to end today by making
at least a passing reference to

01:06:39.646 --> 01:06:46.590
a matter which is of huge
concern to archaeologists,

01:06:46.590 --> 01:06:48.800
and huge concern to all of us,
as human beings,

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:52.320
and that is what happened to
the people of Pompeii,

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:55.400
in those very last moments of
life?

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.512
And archaeologists have been
able to reconstruct exactly what

01:06:59.512 --> 01:07:01.679
happened to--
or not exactly,

01:07:01.679 --> 01:07:06.088
but as close as possible in the
time from which Pompeii was

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:10.240
excavated to now --
to reconstruct again what

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:16.197
happened to these human beings
at the time of the eruption of

01:07:16.197 --> 01:07:17.389
Vesuvius.
 

01:07:17.389 --> 01:07:20.009
They've been able to again to
reconstruct a very moving

01:07:20.009 --> 01:07:21.949
picture of their last moments of
life.

01:07:21.949 --> 01:07:26.090
What we know is that the ash
and lava from Vesuvius--

01:07:26.090 --> 01:07:30.952
and you see a restored view
here of what that would've

01:07:30.952 --> 01:07:34.000
looked like,
and you can see Vesuvius and

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.195
you can see the Forum over here,
with the Temple of Jupiter and

01:07:37.195 --> 01:07:39.612
the Temple of Apollo,
and the throngs of people

01:07:39.612 --> 01:07:42.248
inside the Forum,
at this particular juncture,

01:07:42.248 --> 01:07:44.518
as they look up and see what is
happening.

01:07:44.518 --> 01:07:47.706
And on the right-hand
side--this is actually a view of

01:07:47.706 --> 01:07:48.248
Mount St.
 

01:07:48.248 --> 01:07:50.715
Helens, which as you know
erupted in 1980,

01:07:50.715 --> 01:07:54.083
and the eruptions not so
different, as you gaze upon them

01:07:54.083 --> 01:07:56.789
and look at them,
in comparison today.

01:07:56.789 --> 01:08:00.501
But we know that the eruption
of Vesuvius did not happen all

01:08:00.501 --> 01:08:02.527
at once;
it didn't just happen and cover

01:08:02.527 --> 01:08:02.980
the city.
 

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:03.909
It was gradual.
 

01:08:03.909 --> 01:08:05.690
There was actually quite a bit
of time.

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:06.800
There was time to escape.
 

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:10.173
The Pompeians saw what was
happening, and those who were

01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:11.340
smart did escape.
 

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.159
But like any other natural
disaster,

01:08:14.159 --> 01:08:17.038
there were, of course,
a group of hardy souls,

01:08:17.038 --> 01:08:19.500
or perhaps we would call them
foolhardy souls,

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:22.130
who thought that they could
ride it out.

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:25.127
And they thought they could
ride it out by hiding in their

01:08:25.127 --> 01:08:28.315
own houses or by--
some of the smarter ones of the

01:08:28.315 --> 01:08:32.725
foolhardy type decided that they
could ride it out in some of the

01:08:32.725 --> 01:08:36.293
very strong walled buildings,
public buildings of the city,

01:08:36.293 --> 01:08:37.882
for example,
the bath buildings,

01:08:37.882 --> 01:08:39.859
the Stabian Baths or the Forum
Baths,

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:41.319
that we looked at today.
 

01:08:41.319 --> 01:08:44.590
They were gravely mistaken,
gravely mistaken.

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:46.180
We don't know how many stayed.
 

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.100
We think it was actually a
fairly small number;

01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.539
some have said about a thousand.
 

01:08:49.539 --> 01:08:50.270
We don't know.
 

01:08:50.270 --> 01:08:53.921
But whatever,
those who did stay made a grave

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:57.278
error,
because they were not actually

01:08:57.278 --> 01:09:00.833
killed by the ash and lava,
the molten ash and lava,

01:09:00.833 --> 01:09:02.729
despite the fact that it was
extremely hot.

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:06.368
But what killed them were the
noxious gasses that came into

01:09:06.368 --> 01:09:09.755
the city after the eruption,
that followed that ash and

01:09:09.755 --> 01:09:10.319
lava.
 

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:12.979
They were asphyxiated by those
gasses.

01:09:12.979 --> 01:09:17.167
After they had died,
but before their bodies

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:23.009
decomposed, the ash and lava
formed a protective shell around

01:09:23.009 --> 01:09:26.319
their bodies,
protecting them.

01:09:26.319 --> 01:09:30.520
And what the archaeologists
were clever enough to do is --

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.760
when the modern archaeologists,
when they're working with their

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:35.926
pick axes,
and when that pick axe hit a

01:09:35.926 --> 01:09:41.087
hollow in the ash and lava,
they poured plaster into that

01:09:41.087 --> 01:09:41.738
hollow.
 

01:09:41.738 --> 01:09:44.595
Sometimes that produced
nothing, but sometimes it

01:09:44.595 --> 01:09:47.332
produced bodies,
the actual shape of the bodies

01:09:47.332 --> 01:09:50.130
of those whose bodies had
decomposed there.

01:09:50.130 --> 01:09:53.448
And we can look at those bodies
still today.

01:09:53.448 --> 01:09:57.465
And I show you a scene of a
number of the victims of Pompeii

01:09:57.465 --> 01:10:01.208
huddled together for mutual and
indeed ultimately futile

01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:02.229
protection.
 

01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:05.479
I can show you the body of an
individual who is lying on the

01:10:05.479 --> 01:10:07.831
ground,
his face and his hands trying

01:10:07.831 --> 01:10:11.372
to protect himself obviously
from those noxious gases that

01:10:11.372 --> 01:10:13.050
have come into the city.
 

01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:17.198
I can show you the body,
the plaster cast obviously,

01:10:17.198 --> 01:10:20.703
of the body of another Pompeian
who was sitting with his knees

01:10:20.703 --> 01:10:23.060
up and his hands in front of his
face,

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:26.421
trying to protect himself once
again from those fumes that are

01:10:26.421 --> 01:10:28.350
about to overtake him any
second;

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.643
the body of an individual who's
essentially given up at this

01:10:31.643 --> 01:10:32.090
point.
 

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:33.149
He is expired.
 

01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:34.710
He's lying on his back.
 

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:39.662
There's no hope any longer for
him, a poor fellow who died on

01:10:39.662 --> 01:10:40.569
that day.
 

01:10:40.569 --> 01:10:42.859
And then this fellow,
this heroic fellow,

01:10:42.859 --> 01:10:45.948
who is lifting himself,
in his last moment of life,

01:10:45.948 --> 01:10:48.819
lifting himself,
either to gasp a last breath,

01:10:48.819 --> 01:10:55.261
or perhaps to whisper something
to a dear family member who is

01:10:55.261 --> 01:10:56.738
by his side.
 

01:10:56.738 --> 01:11:00.529
And we even have the body of a
dog.

01:11:00.529 --> 01:11:03.198
This story is particularly sad
because this dog,

01:11:03.198 --> 01:11:06.551
this plaster cast of this dog,
was found with a chain around

01:11:06.551 --> 01:11:07.288
his neck.
 

01:11:07.288 --> 01:11:10.881
So probably what happened here
is the owner of this particular

01:11:10.881 --> 01:11:14.395
dog had the dog chained up,
didn't have time either to take

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:17.774
the dog or to release the dog
from his chain so that he could

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:21.118
try himself to escape,
and that poor dog perished on

01:11:21.118 --> 01:11:25.198
that day and we have the plaster
cast of his body still today.

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:28.905
All of these bodies can still
be seen on the site of Pompeii

01:11:28.905 --> 01:11:31.859
and make a visit there all the
more poignant.

01:11:31.859 --> 01:11:36.395
I know of no more moving human
document from the ancient world

01:11:36.395 --> 01:11:39.368
than these bodies of these
Pompeians,

01:11:39.368 --> 01:11:44.326
kept in perpetuity and for us
to commiserate with and to

01:11:44.326 --> 01:11:46.489
understand even today.
 

01:11:46.489 --> 01:11:46.859
Thank you.

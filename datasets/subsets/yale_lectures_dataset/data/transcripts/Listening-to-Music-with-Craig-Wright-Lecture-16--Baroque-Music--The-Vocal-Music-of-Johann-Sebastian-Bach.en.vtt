00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:05.363
Prof: Today we're going
to start talking about music of

00:00:05.363 --> 00:00:07.662
the Baroque period,
1600 to 1750,

00:00:07.662 --> 00:00:09.890
exemplified by J.S. Bach.
 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:14.874
Today will be the first of two
presentations about the music of

00:00:14.874 --> 00:00:17.239
Bach: one,
today, dealing with Bach's

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.300
vocal music,
the other coming in

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.570
sections--yes,
we have sections on Thursday,

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.606
Friday and Monday--having to do
with the instrumental

00:00:26.606 --> 00:00:28.180
music of J.S. Bach.
 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.085
So we're going to start now
with Baroque music and Bach,

00:00:32.085 --> 00:00:35.210
and a word, first,
about Bach's biography.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.200
Bach came from a very long line
of musicians.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.910
Indeed, ten generations of
Bachs were musicians.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.904
It goes back to old Veit Bach
in the sixteenth century and

00:00:46.904 --> 00:00:50.829
continues generation after
generation into the nineteenth

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:51.670
century.
 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.180
In the area in which Bach was
born,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.927
this small town of
Eisenach--you can see the town's

00:00:57.927 --> 00:01:00.728
name up there and the date in
which he was born,

00:01:00.728 --> 00:01:04.637
1685--in this area of
Thuringia, the region in which

00:01:04.637 --> 00:01:07.771
Eisenach sits,
the word "Bach"

00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:08.870
was eponymous.
 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.519
In other words,
a Bach simply meant a musician

00:01:11.519 --> 00:01:14.227
just like we have the word
"Kleenex,"

00:01:14.227 --> 00:01:16.281
for example,
or we have the word

00:01:16.281 --> 00:01:18.662
"Xerox,"
that begin to take on the

00:01:18.662 --> 00:01:20.599
connotations of an entire class.
 

00:01:20.599 --> 00:01:24.610
So to be a Bach in that area
was to be a musician.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.939
Johann Sebastian Bach was
simply the most talented of this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.840
long-lived clan of musicians.
 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.709
From the age of nine,
J.S. Bach was orphaned.

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:38.650
Both his parents had died by
that time,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.590
so he was raised for the most
part by his older brother,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.831
Johann Christoph Bach,
who was a student of our Johann

00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:48.019
Pachelbel.
 

00:01:48.019 --> 00:01:52.387
So there is this connection
between the Bachs and Pachelbel,

00:01:52.387 --> 00:01:56.310
and for the most part,
J.S. Bach was self-taught.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.660
How did he teach himself music?
 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.500
Well, he copied music.
 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.810
He copied music for two
reasons: One,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.688
to learn the musical style and
two,

00:02:07.688 --> 00:02:10.878
to get music,
because you simply couldn't go

00:02:10.878 --> 00:02:14.068
to a photocopying machine and
copy this--

00:02:14.068 --> 00:02:16.580
the music of Corelli or the
music of Vivaldi.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.740
You had to copy it down
yourself by hand.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.114
You couldn't go to a music
store and buy edited editions

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:27.060
because, for the most part,
that didn't exist.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.425
So much more of it was simply
music copied by one musician

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:31.430
after the next.
 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.530
So Bach learned his craft by
copying, literally,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.190
Corelli.
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.038
And we have run into Corelli,
of course.

00:02:37.038 --> 00:02:40.620
Anybody remember a piece by
Corelli that we performed?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.240
Frederick.
 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.750
Student: "La
Folia."

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.157
Prof: "La
Folia," excellent,

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:45.470
and he copied Vivaldi.
 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.220
What's Vivaldi's most famous
composition?

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.848
Frederick again.
 

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:50.240
Student: The Four
Seasons.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.590
Prof: The Four
Seasons..

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.740
So he copied that and he also
copied some other concerti

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.153
grossi of Vivaldi--
oftentimes surreptitiously by

00:03:01.153 --> 00:03:04.560
moonlight when he was supposed
to be in bed.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.908
Bach's devotion to his
profession was legendary.

00:03:07.908 --> 00:03:12.522
When he was a young man he sort
of went AWOL from his first job

00:03:12.522 --> 00:03:15.500
and walked from the town of
Arnstadt--

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.235
which you see up there--walked
from Arnstadt in the center part

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:23.032
of Germany all the way up to the
Hanseatic city of Lubeck on the

00:03:23.032 --> 00:03:26.401
North Sea up there,
a distance of about two hundred

00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:29.527
fifty miles,
in order to be able to sit at

00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:33.812
the feet of a very famous
organist and composer there in

00:03:33.812 --> 00:03:36.830
Lubeck,
and then he walked back.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.264
It would be like one of us
wanting to learn something from

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:41.615
a congressman or something and
walking from New Haven to

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:42.940
Washington, D.C.,
and back.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.959
In his day Bach was legendary
not so much as a composer oddly

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.800
enough, but as what?
 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.590
What was Bach known for in his
day?

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.789
We touched on this before.
 

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:53.340
Angela.
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.960
Student:
&gt;

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.379
Prof: He was an organist.
 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.129
Okay.
 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:57.098
So he was an organist.
 

00:03:57.098 --> 00:04:01.693
He was the great virtuoso
organist of central northern

00:04:01.693 --> 00:04:03.860
Germany in this period.
 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.460
Now, we have met an organ piece
of Bach before.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.590
What was that?
 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.250
 
 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:14.909
The name--Michael?
 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:15.129
Student: Mitch.
 

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.649
Prof: Mitch. Okay. Yes.
 

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:17.399
What was that, please?
 

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.240
Student: G Minor Fugue.
 

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.430
Prof: G Minor Fugue.
 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:20.769
Can you sing any of it?
 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.550
Could anybody sing any of it?
 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.425
Hey, we got some takers down
here, Chris and A.J.,

00:04:26.425 --> 00:04:27.540
together, a duet.
 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:28.519
Gentlemen, please.
 

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:35.170
Students:
&gt;

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.293
Prof: Excellent.
 

00:04:37.293 --> 00:04:38.031
Oh, wow.
 

00:04:38.031 --> 00:04:38.769
Bravo.
 

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:40.338
Okay.
 

00:04:40.338 --> 00:04:49.120
&gt;
 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.379
I think that's sort of the key
that they sang it in.

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:55.315
We'll come back to that idea in
just a minute because I have

00:04:55.315 --> 00:04:58.300
found myself tripping over that
fugue subject and another one

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.384
that I want to talk about this
morning as I was trying to think

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:02.379
through these.
 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:04.500
There's another famous
piece--organ piece of Bach--that

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.720
we might have heard recently.
 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.379
It should be track one.
 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:13.797
Let's listen to a toccata by
Bach written in Arnstadt early

00:05:13.797 --> 00:05:14.740
in his career.
 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.060
&gt;
 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:37.759
 
 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:40.139
Okay. We don't have that queued.
 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.774
I'm sorry, but you probably
heard it at the concert the

00:05:42.774 --> 00:05:43.360
other day.
 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.509
&gt;
 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:51.870
It's a big organ piece in D
minor, kind of spooky music that

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.579
begins every Halloween show.
 

00:05:53.579 --> 00:05:57.490
Well, that's more organ music
by J.S. Bach.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.009
We may be able to resurrect
that after a while.

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:00.930
We'll find out.
 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.213
And again, a piece that he
composed as a young man here in

00:06:06.213 --> 00:06:10.199
the town of Arnstadt,
roughly 1705 or so.

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.225
So there he is,
first job, and we won't say

00:06:12.225 --> 00:06:15.023
"fresh out of college"
because Bach did not go to

00:06:15.023 --> 00:06:16.982
college,
but he went to a very

00:06:16.982 --> 00:06:20.790
high-standing prep school in the
northern part of Germany,

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:23.490
just graduated,
has his first job at Arnstadt.

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.065
Let's take a look
at--Raoul--here is the picture

00:06:27.065 --> 00:06:30.490
of our great man,
but let's go on to our first

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:33.230
real slide there,
and I think--

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:38.129
That's the organ in the church
at Arnstadt where Bach worked.

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.779
The organ is still there.
 

00:06:40.779 --> 00:06:44.720
The essential parts of the
pipes and all are still there.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.839
That's the very organ that Bach
played,

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:49.497
but they've sort of modernized
it over the centuries and they

00:06:49.497 --> 00:06:52.166
took out the original console--
so Raoul, if we could have the

00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:54.930
next slide,
please--and there is the

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.769
console.
 

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:59.346
This is kind of the central
processing unit,

00:06:59.346 --> 00:07:02.009
if you will,
for Bach's organ.

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.526
So you can see--does that look
like a big organ or a small

00:07:05.526 --> 00:07:07.500
organ to you by our standards?
 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.790
Yeah, kind of on the smaller
side.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.220
There were bigger ones,
actually, up to the north,

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:18.394
but you can see here--some of
you did that extra-credit

00:07:18.394 --> 00:07:22.380
project on the organ--
two keyboards and a pedal board

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.430
down here to be played,
obviously, with the feet.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.185
And what do you suppose these
things are lurking all around

00:07:29.185 --> 00:07:29.509
it?
 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.430
What would we call those?
 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.660
We're going to pull one of
those.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.569
Student: A stop.
 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:35.800
Prof: A stop, okay.
 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.259
And it brings into play an
extra rank of pipes,

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:42.060
pipes of a particular sound,
and we have this expression,

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.759
"Oh, I'm going to pull out
all the stops."

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:47.250
Well, of course that has to do
with organ technology.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.829
So this is Bach's--the console,
in effect, of Bach's original

00:07:51.829 --> 00:07:52.440
organ.
 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.747
Bach eventually left Arnstadt
and moved on to the larger city

00:07:56.747 --> 00:08:03.081
of Weimar where he stayed,
as you can see there,

00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:08.670
from 1708 to 1717,
and he functioned as an

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.149
organist and a court musician
there.

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:15.562
In 1717, he decided to leave
that position in Weimar and move

00:08:15.562 --> 00:08:19.778
on to another town,
Coethen, and the Duke of

00:08:19.778 --> 00:08:24.673
Weimar, Duke Wilhelm,
summarily had Bach thrown in

00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:25.189
jail.
 

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:29.252
Bach was thrown in jail for a
month, sat in jail,

00:08:29.252 --> 00:08:31.028
languished in jail.
 

00:08:31.028 --> 00:08:33.356
We think he started the
"Well-Tempered

00:08:33.356 --> 00:08:35.019
Clavier"
while in jail.

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:37.673
Why did the duke have Bach
thrown in jail?

00:08:37.673 --> 00:08:38.450
Any ideas?
 

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.923
Well, he hadn't obtained a
release from the duke,

00:08:41.923 --> 00:08:46.195
and this tells us something
about the status of musicians in

00:08:46.195 --> 00:08:48.149
the eighteenth century.
 

00:08:48.149 --> 00:08:50.928
They were little better than
indentured servants.

00:08:50.928 --> 00:08:54.417
No such thing as free agency
here, not like baseball players

00:08:54.417 --> 00:08:55.600
or whatever today.
 

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.303
If you wanted to take another
position, you had to get your

00:08:59.303 --> 00:09:01.730
present employer to say,
"Okay.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.870
It's all right if you go."
 

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.360
Imagine that today.
 

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.220
You want to quit your job and
move on to a better job.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:10.210
Well, you can't leave until the
present boss says you can go.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.639
But that was the case and Bach
had violated that modus

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:15.200
operandi and there he
languished in jail for a month.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.971
Finally the Duke of Weimar
relented and off Bach and his

00:09:18.971 --> 00:09:21.509
family went to the town of
Coethen.

00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:24.360
Let's take a look at the next
slide, please,

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.940
the town of Coethen,
again, sort of central Germany.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.899
This is an engraving of the
mid-seventeenth century,

00:09:31.899 --> 00:09:35.859
and we can see here the
court--building of complexes

00:09:35.859 --> 00:09:39.120
where Bach worked there in the
center.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.830
Now we're going to go to the
front of that next slide as it

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:43.788
stands today.
 

00:09:43.788 --> 00:09:47.149
It's rather heavily damaged
after communist occupation after

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:49.542
World War II,
rather--not in the best state

00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:50.340
of repair.
 

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.379
You go inside the courtyard
there.

00:09:52.379 --> 00:09:54.759
Next slide, please.
 

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:57.837
Going in you can see it's
something of a mess because they

00:09:57.837 --> 00:10:00.917
are fixing up that room and
indeed have fixed up that room

00:10:00.917 --> 00:10:01.620
up above.
 

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.676
Let's have the next slide,
please, and here is that room

00:10:06.676 --> 00:10:10.306
up above,
the so-called now Crystal Room

00:10:10.306 --> 00:10:14.270
of the palace at Coethen,
and this was where Bach

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:15.080
performed.
 

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.115
And when you go to sections
this week you will watch a

00:10:18.115 --> 00:10:21.609
wonderful video of a performance
of the Bach "Brandenburg

00:10:21.609 --> 00:10:22.581
Concerto"
No.

00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:25.788
5 performed right in this hall,
and you'll see those same

00:10:25.788 --> 00:10:27.048
windows there.
 

00:10:27.048 --> 00:10:32.581
This is Bach's music performed
in the environment for which

00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:34.679
Bach had created it.
 

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:38.000
In 1723, Bach moved again.
 

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.726
He was an aggressive,
ambitious person,

00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:43.100
J.S. Bach.
 

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:47.654
He moved this time to the city
of Leipzig, a little bit to the

00:10:47.654 --> 00:10:51.015
south of Coethen,
and he spent the rest of his

00:10:51.015 --> 00:10:52.658
career in Leipzig.
 

00:10:52.658 --> 00:10:56.315
He moved to Leipzig in 1723 for
two reasons, and we'll come back

00:10:56.315 --> 00:10:57.649
to those two reasons.
 

00:10:57.649 --> 00:11:01.932
But while I have this slide up
here let's just put this in

00:11:01.932 --> 00:11:03.658
context a little bit.
 

00:11:03.658 --> 00:11:06.038
You can see where Berlin is
there.

00:11:06.038 --> 00:11:08.322
You can see where Lubeck is
where he walked,

00:11:08.322 --> 00:11:09.649
all the way at the top.
 

00:11:09.649 --> 00:11:12.822
This is central Germany here
and these towns aren't too far

00:11:12.822 --> 00:11:13.259
apart.
 

00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:14.539
Here's Coethen.
 

00:11:14.539 --> 00:11:15.940
Here's Leipzig.
 

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:19.873
So in 1723 he goes to Leipzig
and he goes there for two

00:11:19.873 --> 00:11:21.840
reasons: One--next slide.
 

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.312
One, because his family will be
given, by the standards of the

00:11:26.312 --> 00:11:28.879
time, rather large quarters
here.

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:32.447
Actually, by our standards they
were very small--nine hundred

00:11:32.447 --> 00:11:33.279
square feet.
 

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:36.663
Bach ultimately had twenty
children and they were living in

00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:38.240
nine hundred square feet.
 

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.943
Ask yourself--do you know how
many square feet are in your

00:11:40.943 --> 00:11:42.320
parents' apartment or home?
 

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:45.090
A lot more than nine hundred,
but that--

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:48.600
this was thought to be big digs
back in the eighteenth century,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.918
in these cities that were
encased by military fortresses.

00:11:51.918 --> 00:11:54.446
In any event,
we can see Bach's working area

00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:57.149
and living area right here in
this building.

00:11:57.149 --> 00:11:59.711
And I want you to count the
number of stories because it

00:11:59.711 --> 00:12:01.250
will become important later on.
 

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:05.519
One, two, three and then the
roof begins.

00:12:05.519 --> 00:12:08.673
And I also want you to--it's
hard to see on this slide but

00:12:08.673 --> 00:12:11.330
there's a group of choirboys
walking out here.

00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.658
How do I know they're choirboys?
 

00:12:12.658 --> 00:12:14.049
'Cause they're arranged by
height.

00:12:14.049 --> 00:12:15.210
Ever look at choirboys?
 

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.155
That's how they arrange them
when they walk in procession,

00:12:18.155 --> 00:12:21.000
the young kids first,
the older ones toward the back.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.139
We'll come back to that point
in just a minute.

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:27.802
Another reason Bach moved to
Leipzig was it was a university

00:12:27.802 --> 00:12:31.032
town, so he'd get a free
university education for his

00:12:31.032 --> 00:12:32.149
numerous sons.
 

00:12:32.149 --> 00:12:33.950
What about his numerous
daughters?

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:36.320
Did they get a free education
at the university?

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.889
No, because women did not go to
the university in this period.

00:12:40.889 --> 00:12:43.048
The first woman to receive a
degree,

00:12:43.048 --> 00:12:47.369
a college degree,
in a Western university was a

00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:53.658
woman enrolled in philosophy at
the University of Padua in 1676,

00:12:53.658 --> 00:12:56.129
so it would be unprecedented,
really.

00:12:56.129 --> 00:13:00.083
I mean, there was one precedent
in Bach's day for women to go to

00:13:00.083 --> 00:13:00.899
university.
 

00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:03.450
It was assumed that just the
men would go to university.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.583
In any event,
let's talk about Bach's

00:13:06.583 --> 00:13:09.980
standing here in the town of
Leipzig.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.600
Bach had to petition for this
job.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.793
He wanted this job because it
had these advantages,

00:13:15.793 --> 00:13:18.604
as mentioned,
and he was not the first choice

00:13:18.604 --> 00:13:20.840
of the town council of Leipzig.
 

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:24.081
There was another composer who
was their first choice,

00:13:24.081 --> 00:13:25.610
Georg Philipp Telemann.
 

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.690
He declined the position.
 

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.840
They offered it to somebody
else named Graupner.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.865
He couldn't get a release from
his employer so he couldn't take

00:13:33.865 --> 00:13:34.190
it.
 

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:38.480
And so, as the town minutes of
the town council--

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.970
the minutes of the town
council--say,

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.798
since good musicians can't be
had we'll--

00:13:43.798 --> 00:13:47.210
mediocre ones will have to
suffice.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:51.725
And they turned at that point
to Bach, which I guess calls us

00:13:51.725 --> 00:13:56.090
to ask how many misjudgments are
we making in our lives?

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:56.607
Maybe A.J.
 

00:13:56.607 --> 00:13:58.993
doesn't realize that sitting
right next to him,

00:13:58.993 --> 00:14:00.912
Chris there,
is really a genius and we

00:14:00.912 --> 00:14:02.519
should pay more attention.
 

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:06.239
How many geniuses are sort of
sneaking around in our midst

00:14:06.239 --> 00:14:07.610
unrecognized today?
 

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:12.815
Anyway, Bach was anything other
than the grande artiste

00:14:12.815 --> 00:14:15.288
when he arrived in Leipzig.
 

00:14:15.288 --> 00:14:19.636
Here I've made some Xeroxes out
of my book called The Bach

00:14:19.636 --> 00:14:20.288
Reader.
 

00:14:20.288 --> 00:14:22.528
When Bach got there,
he had to take an oath of

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:22.940
office.
 

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.379
He had to swear to do the
following: "One,

00:14:25.379 --> 00:14:30.025
I shall set the boys a shining
example of honest and retiring

00:14:30.025 --> 00:14:33.501
manner of life,
serve the school industriously

00:14:33.501 --> 00:14:36.210
and instruct the boys
conscientiously.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:40.553
Two, bring the music in all the
principal churches of the town

00:14:40.553 --> 00:14:43.759
into good estate to the best of
my ability.

00:14:43.759 --> 00:14:47.907
Three, show the honorable and
most wise council all proper

00:14:47.907 --> 00:14:50.090
respect and obedience."
 

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.320
And so on it goes.
 

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.438
Here are a few more things:
"Faithfully instruct the

00:14:54.438 --> 00:14:57.335
boys not only in vocal music but
also in instrumental

00:14:57.335 --> 00:15:00.509
music," and he had to teach
them Latin as well,

00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:04.706
"--arrange the music that
it shall not last too

00:15:04.706 --> 00:15:07.668
long,"
&gt;

00:15:07.668 --> 00:15:11.192
"--and shall be of such a
nature as not to make an

00:15:11.192 --> 00:15:14.649
operatic impression but rather
incite the listeners to

00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:15.889
devotion."
 

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:18.509
So they didn't want Bach's
music to go on too long,

00:15:18.509 --> 00:15:21.285
which is very important,
and they didn't want it to be

00:15:21.285 --> 00:15:22.230
very operatic.
 

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.600
They wanted sort of
conservative music there.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:27.746
Here's number twelve:
Not to go out of town without

00:15:27.746 --> 00:15:29.808
the permission of the honorable
Burgermeister.

00:15:29.808 --> 00:15:32.929
Number thirteen:
Always walk as far as possible

00:15:32.929 --> 00:15:34.830
with the boys at funerals.
 

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.720
So Bach here in Leipzig is sort
of a glorified scoutmaster.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.511
He's not this kind of
nineteenth-century image of the

00:15:41.511 --> 00:15:44.678
genius or the--of the grande
artiste as mentioned.

00:15:44.678 --> 00:15:48.765
Okay, the point being,
once again, that Bach in his

00:15:48.765 --> 00:15:53.751
day was recognized and valued
not so much as a composer but as

00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:55.058
a performer.
 

00:15:55.058 --> 00:15:57.210
Well, what was the matter with
Bach's music?

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:00.629
Why were they already at the
outset here, sort of clipping

00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:03.750
his wings, telling him what
style not to write in?

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:07.754
Well, Bach had this proclivity
for writing music that's very

00:16:07.754 --> 00:16:10.480
sort of rigid,
very chromatic,

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.038
very contrapuntal and very
long,

00:16:14.038 --> 00:16:17.104
and it is long and
contrapuntal,

00:16:17.104 --> 00:16:22.048
as we will be seeing in
particular in sections this

00:16:22.048 --> 00:16:23.629
coming week.
 

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:25.619
If we compare,
for example,

00:16:25.619 --> 00:16:30.057
two concerti grossi:
the first movement of Vivaldi's

00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:33.561
Spring Concerto,
it lasts three minutes and ten

00:16:33.561 --> 00:16:36.057
seconds;
Bach writes a first movement of

00:16:36.057 --> 00:16:37.808
a concerto grosso.
 

00:16:37.808 --> 00:16:39.210
You're going to watch a video
of it.

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:42.558
It runs for nine minutes and
ten seconds.

00:16:42.558 --> 00:16:47.476
So it's three times as long,
three times as dense,

00:16:47.476 --> 00:16:48.580
in a way.
 

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:49.077
Okay.
 

00:16:49.077 --> 00:16:54.450
Let's go on to talk about the
kinds of things that Bach

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.827
composed here,
and for that we'll take a look

00:16:58.827 --> 00:17:00.620
at the board.
 

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.612
Bach's works:
Some of these we've talked

00:17:04.612 --> 00:17:06.250
about already.
 

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.960
Preludes and fugues for
harpsichord or keyboard;

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.670
"The Well-Tempered
Clavier."

00:17:11.670 --> 00:17:14.390
We've talked about the G Minor
organ fugue.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:17.598
We can talk about "The Art
of the Fugue."

00:17:17.598 --> 00:17:19.868
Let's-- Raoul,
let's have the next slide.

00:17:19.868 --> 00:17:22.160
I think I've got a slide of
that here.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.559
No, wrong piece.
 

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:26.368
Okay. Sorry.
 

00:17:26.368 --> 00:17:27.890
This is the Bach
"Brandenburg."

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.130
I've brought in the wrong slide.
 

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:29.940
I'm sorry.
 

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.715
But "The Art of
Fugue" is an interesting

00:17:33.715 --> 00:17:38.880
composition that Bach wrote very
much toward the end of his life;

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:44.390
sonatas for flutes and violin;
dance suites for orchestra.

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.496
You may know the "Air on a
G String"--beautiful,

00:17:48.496 --> 00:17:52.459
beautiful solo violin writing
there, with basso continuo

00:17:52.459 --> 00:17:55.942
underneath;
solo concertos for violin and

00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:59.425
harpsichord;
the concerti grossi that

00:17:59.425 --> 00:18:02.261
we'll be talking about;
the "Brandenburg

00:18:02.261 --> 00:18:03.049
Concertos."
 

00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:05.568
We'll be working with No. 5.
 

00:18:05.568 --> 00:18:08.935
Then he wrote a lot of
religious vocal music:

00:18:08.935 --> 00:18:10.390
the B Minor Mass.
 

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:15.642
I was playing parts of the
Sanctus of the B Minor Mass when

00:18:15.642 --> 00:18:16.819
we came in.
 

00:18:16.819 --> 00:18:28.160
 
 

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.608
Let's just listen to a little
bit of--

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.269
we listen to this on the fly
this morning,

00:18:31.269 --> 00:18:34.955
but let's just listen to a bit
of the Sanctus of the B Minor

00:18:34.955 --> 00:18:38.892
Mass to give you a sense of the
monumental quality that Bach can

00:18:38.892 --> 00:18:39.579
create.
 

00:18:39.579 --> 00:19:49.049
&gt;
 

00:19:49.049 --> 00:19:51.470
So pretty impressive stuff.
 

00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:55.023
But it goes on for a long time
and it's filled with imitation

00:19:55.023 --> 00:19:58.281
and fugal subjects that
recombine and different kinds of

00:19:58.281 --> 00:19:59.288
permutations.
 

00:19:59.288 --> 00:20:02.633
It can be inverted and go
backwards and forwards and

00:20:02.633 --> 00:20:05.650
upside down, and this is what
Bach would do.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.115
If somebody would write a set
of variations that had ten

00:20:08.115 --> 00:20:09.906
variations in it,
he would write a set of

00:20:09.906 --> 00:20:11.880
variations with twenty
variations in it.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.921
If somebody would write one
canon, he would write ten

00:20:14.921 --> 00:20:16.733
canons--as he does,
for example,

00:20:16.733 --> 00:20:19.250
in "The Goldberg
Variations."

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.259
Whatever he did,
he prosecuted maniacally,

00:20:22.259 --> 00:20:25.278
and what he ended up with was
stuff that's very dense,

00:20:25.278 --> 00:20:28.358
very compact,
that's really the best sort of

00:20:28.358 --> 00:20:32.226
craftsmanship but it's not
necessarily the most popular

00:20:32.226 --> 00:20:34.588
sort of music in that regard.
 

00:20:34.588 --> 00:20:38.664
But, as you heard,
it can be very grand and quite

00:20:38.664 --> 00:20:43.759
spectacular, as we heard from
the Sanctus of the B Minor Mass

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:44.608
there.
 

00:20:44.608 --> 00:20:48.769
When Bach arrived in Leipzig,
it was a town of thirty-five

00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:52.420
thousand, and was one of the
biggest in Germany.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:56.470
Does that sound like a big town
to you, thirty-five thousand?

00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.660
No.
 

00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.093
I mean, Hamden probably has
thirty-five thousand people

00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:01.108
living in it.
 

00:21:01.108 --> 00:21:06.055
But this was a big city in
Bach's day, and he was called

00:21:06.055 --> 00:21:11.451
there to run music really for
all of the Lutheran churches in

00:21:11.451 --> 00:21:12.710
that town.
 

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:17.163
Now we're talking here Leipzig,
which is not far from

00:21:17.163 --> 00:21:21.019
Wittenberg where Martin Luther
was active,

00:21:21.019 --> 00:21:24.718
so we're talking about kind of
the home ground of Lutheranism

00:21:24.718 --> 00:21:25.150
here.
 

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.450
And Leipzig enjoyed complete
freedom of religion.

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:31.401
You could attend any church--of
course, this was all

00:21:31.401 --> 00:21:32.269
Christianity.
 

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:37.170
You could attend any church
that you wished.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.440
There were a dozen or so of
them in this city.

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:42.828
The only kicker was that they
were all Lutheran churches.

00:21:42.828 --> 00:21:45.888
You could go to this Lutheran
church or that Lutheran church,

00:21:45.888 --> 00:21:48.336
whatever one you want,
but they were all Lutheran

00:21:48.336 --> 00:21:49.000
churches.
 

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.190
So Bach's job was to organize
the music for these churches,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.820
particularly the principal
church, which was this Saint

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.630
Thomas Church,
and what he wrote for this

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:04.819
Saint Thomas Church was this
thing called the cantata.

00:22:04.819 --> 00:22:06.220
What's a cantata?
 

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.807
Well, literally it's a
"sung thing"

00:22:09.807 --> 00:22:14.049
as opposed to a sonata,
"sounded thing."

00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:15.910
So this is a sung thing.
 

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.519
What can we say about the
cantatas that Bach wrote?

00:22:19.519 --> 00:22:20.608
How would we summarize them?
 

00:22:20.608 --> 00:22:24.224
Well, they are
multi-movements--recitative,

00:22:24.224 --> 00:22:26.980
aria, chorus--multi-movements.
 

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.038
They go on for about
twenty-five to thirty minutes.

00:22:31.038 --> 00:22:36.118
They are religious in subject
matter and of course they are

00:22:36.118 --> 00:22:41.112
written in the German language,
and Bach wrote about three

00:22:41.112 --> 00:22:43.740
hundred of these cantatas.
 

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.920
He wrote them in cycles of
fifty.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.997
When he arrived there in
seventeen twenty-three,

00:22:47.997 --> 00:22:50.118
he starts writing one cantata
for each Sunday.

00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:53.000
At the end of the year,
he's got about fifty of these

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.779
things;
next year he starts all over

00:22:54.779 --> 00:22:55.098
again.
 

00:22:55.098 --> 00:22:58.308
So he ended up with about three
hundred cantatas.

00:22:58.308 --> 00:23:03.124
Then he got exhausted from the
process and stopped about

00:23:03.124 --> 00:23:04.700
1729,1730 or so.
 

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:10.444
Now on the board up here you
see the layout of a typical

00:23:10.444 --> 00:23:11.490
cantata.
 

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:18.058
It is "Wachet auf,
ruft uns die Stimme,"

00:23:18.058 --> 00:23:21.938
"Arise,
a Voice is Calling,"

00:23:21.938 --> 00:23:24.980
and here's--
I hope you can see this okay.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.538
Here's how it shakes down.
 

00:23:26.538 --> 00:23:31.380
We have seven movements in this
cantata, seven movements.

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:36.990
And they are arranged chorus,
then recitative.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:38.700
What's a recitative?
 

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.298
Somebody tell us what a
recitative is.

00:23:40.298 --> 00:23:44.521
We haven't talked about it but
maybe you know from other

00:23:44.521 --> 00:23:45.289
context.
 

00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:46.490
Jacob.
 

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.950
Student: It's a short,
conversational piece.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:50.355
Prof: Yeah.
 

00:23:50.355 --> 00:23:50.747
Okay.
 

00:23:50.747 --> 00:23:54.499
It's not much music,
more sort of spoken dialogue

00:23:54.499 --> 00:23:58.328
accompanied a little bit by a
basso continuo.

00:23:58.328 --> 00:24:02.067
Anybody tell me from the
reading what a basso continuo

00:24:02.067 --> 00:24:02.420
is?
 

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:07.009
Well, I think if you look on
your text in about page one

00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:11.061
hundred fourteen,
you'll find a discussion of it,

00:24:11.061 --> 00:24:15.750
but a basso continuo is an
ensemble that plays a bass line,

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:18.509
and because a number of
instruments are involved in it--

00:24:18.509 --> 00:24:20.348
it'd be the left hand of the
harpsichord,

00:24:20.348 --> 00:24:23.460
maybe a cello,
maybe also a bassoon,

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.509
two, three instruments playing
a bass line.

00:24:26.509 --> 00:24:29.896
It makes for a very heavy,
very powerful bass line,

00:24:29.896 --> 00:24:33.759
and this is something that is
typical of Baroque music.

00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:37.512
So a recitative will be--and
indeed all the arias--will be

00:24:37.512 --> 00:24:39.618
accompanied by basso continuo.
 

00:24:39.618 --> 00:24:42.450
The choral stuff will be
accompanied by basso continuo.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.934
Continuum--it's just always
going, so it's a strong bass

00:24:45.934 --> 00:24:47.328
that's always going.
 

00:24:47.328 --> 00:24:50.073
It's different from the
basso ostinato because

00:24:50.073 --> 00:24:52.289
what happens in a basso
ostinato?

00:24:52.289 --> 00:24:54.950
Yong.
 

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:55.618
Student: It keeps
repeating.

00:24:55.618 --> 00:24:59.969
Prof: It keeps repeating
over and over and over again so

00:24:59.969 --> 00:25:04.037
a basso ostinato would be
a particular kind of basso

00:25:04.037 --> 00:25:08.009
continuo,
a kind of species of basso

00:25:08.009 --> 00:25:09.160
continuo.
 

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.699
But basso continuo,
a bass that's always going on

00:25:11.699 --> 00:25:12.808
and is very strong.
 

00:25:12.808 --> 00:25:15.992
So we have sort of spoken
dialogue with a strong bass,

00:25:15.992 --> 00:25:18.576
then an aria,
and I'm going to say something

00:25:18.576 --> 00:25:21.160
about this--these arias in this
period.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:24.690
They are Da Capo arias in the
Baroque period.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:27.019
What does a Da Capo aria mean?
 

00:25:27.019 --> 00:25:30.348
Anybody peeked ahead at
that--in the discussions in--

00:25:30.348 --> 00:25:33.364
around pages one hundred fifty,
one hundred sixty or so in the

00:25:33.364 --> 00:25:35.759
text--
or know that from other

00:25:35.759 --> 00:25:36.630
contexts?
 

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:39.440
What would a Da Capo aria be?
 

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.549
Well, literally "Da
Capo" sounds like a film

00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:44.368
score, the capo or something.
 

00:25:44.368 --> 00:25:47.212
It means the head guy or in
this case the beginning of the

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:48.759
music, the head of the music.
 

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:50.690
It means you take it from the
beginning of the music.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:54.269
So you do one section,
an A section,

00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:58.351
and then you have a contrasting
section and then you get this

00:25:58.351 --> 00:26:00.961
sign that says DC,
"Da Capo,"

00:26:00.961 --> 00:26:04.390
and then you go back and do the
A section all over again.

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:08.184
So what form do we end up with
when we have a Da Capo aria then

00:26:08.184 --> 00:26:08.920
obviously?
 

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:11.210
Ternary form. Okay?
 

00:26:11.210 --> 00:26:15.065
So the arias in here are
usually structured in the

00:26:15.065 --> 00:26:20.488
Baroque period in Da Capo form,
and then we have the choruses:

00:26:20.488 --> 00:26:23.700
chorus one,
chorus four, chorus seven.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:30.270
And in each of these choruses
we are making use of this thing

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.900
called a chorale tune.
 

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.279
What's a chorale?
 

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:35.509
What's a chorale tune?
 

00:26:35.509 --> 00:26:38.752
Well, a chorale tune is just
what other Christian

00:26:38.752 --> 00:26:42.740
denominations would call a hymn
or what we hear at Yale--

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.269
whether we're Muslim,
whether we're Jewish or whether

00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:53.593
we're Christian,
we're going to have to sing

00:26:53.593 --> 00:26:59.849
&gt;
 

00:26:59.849 --> 00:27:00.500
and so on it goes.
 

00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:01.914
I think it's called "Duke
Street,"

00:27:01.914 --> 00:27:03.571
"Oh,
God, beneath the--oh,

00:27:03.571 --> 00:27:06.877
God, above the rising stars thy
exiled fathers cross the

00:27:06.877 --> 00:27:07.660
sea."
 

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.826
It was actually written here in
New Haven, so it's kind of the

00:27:11.826 --> 00:27:15.380
Yale hymn, if you will,
or maybe the Yale chorale.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.073
So these chorales were sort of
old melodies,

00:27:18.073 --> 00:27:19.640
old religious melodies.
 

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:23.348
Some of them were remakes of
Gregorian chants.

00:27:23.348 --> 00:27:25.967
The Lutherans just took old
Catholic chants and turned them

00:27:25.967 --> 00:27:26.960
in to chorale tunes.
 

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:29.642
Others were newly composed,
going all the way back to the

00:27:29.642 --> 00:27:30.598
sixteenth century.
 

00:27:30.598 --> 00:27:34.460
Martin Luther himself composed
chorale tunes.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.558
Can anybody name a chorale tune
or a hymn tune by Martin Luther?

00:27:37.558 --> 00:27:48.589
I bet you--
&gt;

00:27:48.589 --> 00:27:50.970
Anybody know the name of that?
 

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:52.920
Yes. Kristin, is it?
 

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.255
Okay.
 

00:27:53.255 --> 00:27:55.400
Nice and loud,
please, Kristin.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.808
Student: A Mighty
Fortress is Our God."

00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:57.452
Prof: Okay.
 

00:27:57.452 --> 00:27:58.950
"A Mighty Fortress is Our
God."

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:02.990
It's a Reformation--so the
Reformation chorale,

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:08.348
and musicians have used that
frequently over the centuries.

00:28:08.348 --> 00:28:10.894
So we're going--not going to be
working with "A Mighty

00:28:10.894 --> 00:28:11.640
Fortress."
 

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:14.528
We're going to be working with
a different chorale tune,

00:28:14.528 --> 00:28:17.155
"Wachet auf,
ruft uns die Stimme,"

00:28:17.155 --> 00:28:20.577
which was a couple hundred
years old by the time Bach got

00:28:20.577 --> 00:28:23.930
his hands on it,
and you have it here.

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.730
So on your sheet-- Everybody
got the sheet for today?

00:28:27.730 --> 00:28:40.730
 
 

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:47.445
So here is a chorale tune and
it's in lots of phrases.

00:28:47.445 --> 00:28:48.460
Right?
 

00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.509
What about this?
 

00:28:49.509 --> 00:29:03.088
&gt;
 

00:29:03.088 --> 00:29:05.490
Do you think that's a tonal
melody?

00:29:05.490 --> 00:29:09.156
Does that sound pretty secure
for you or does that sound sort

00:29:09.156 --> 00:29:09.829
of weird?
 

00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:11.700
Roger, what do you think?
 

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:13.170
Student: I think it
sounds secure--

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:14.613
Prof: Sounds secure.
 

00:29:14.613 --> 00:29:16.750
It is tonal,
and why would you imagine it

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:17.660
sounds secure?
 

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.655
If you look at the downbeat of
each measure,

00:29:20.655 --> 00:29:24.278
almost every measure,
what notes do we have there?

00:29:24.278 --> 00:29:28.759
They're notes that form
&gt;

00:29:28.759 --> 00:29:32.450
a triad, a major triad,
&gt;

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:34.868
so we mustn't forget all that
stuff we studied early on.

00:29:34.868 --> 00:29:38.558
So here's Bach borrowing a
chorale tune;

00:29:38.558 --> 00:29:42.807
he is foregrounding a major
triad in a big way,

00:29:42.807 --> 00:29:45.298
and who has to sing this?
 

00:29:45.298 --> 00:29:46.769
Well, ultimately the full
congregation.

00:29:46.769 --> 00:29:50.836
Everybody has to sing these
chorale tunes to show that you

00:29:50.836 --> 00:29:52.018
are a--
in this case,

00:29:52.018 --> 00:29:53.220
a good Lutheran,
I suppose,

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:57.328
so everybody was expected to
sing them,

00:29:57.328 --> 00:29:59.992
and because of that,
they tended to be rather

00:29:59.992 --> 00:30:00.720
step-wise.
 

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.602
So we should all sing this.
 

00:30:02.602 --> 00:30:03.088
Right?
 

00:30:03.088 --> 00:30:05.318
Today we're all going to be
good Lutherans,

00:30:05.318 --> 00:30:07.480
no matter what our real
religion is,

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.511
assuming we have a real
religion, so let's &lt;&lt;plays

00:30:10.511 --> 00:30:11.338
piano&gt;&gt;
 

00:30:11.338 --> 00:30:11.875
start here.
 

00:30:11.875 --> 00:30:13.869
We're just going to sing
"la."

00:30:13.869 --> 00:30:14.400
Here we go.
 

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:31.150
&gt;
 

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:32.788
Okay. Great.
 

00:30:32.788 --> 00:30:36.396
Now this is not working so
well, and why is it not working

00:30:36.396 --> 00:30:37.029
so well?
 

00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.640
Student: It's too high.
 

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.700
Prof: It's too high.
 

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.308
So what would Bach have done in
those days?

00:30:41.308 --> 00:30:43.140
The only person here that can
sing this is Lynda--

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.708
Lynda and Santana 'cause
they're sopranos and I could

00:30:45.708 --> 00:30:48.482
hear them,
but that was about all I could

00:30:48.482 --> 00:30:48.910
hear.
 

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:52.490
It's too high so what would
they have done in Bach's day?

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.269
Stopped singing it?
 

00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.849
I don't know.
 

00:30:54.849 --> 00:30:57.529
Lightning bolts would come down
on the church or something.

00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:58.538
I'm not quite sure.
 

00:30:58.538 --> 00:30:59.960
No, they couldn't stop singing
it.

00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.390
They had to transpose it,
just take it down.

00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:03.470
We'll, make it lower.
 

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:09.150
&gt;
 

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:10.305
We'll go to a different key.
 

00:31:10.305 --> 00:31:10.799
Here we go.
 

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:12.180
Ready, sing.
 

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:15.992
&gt;
 

00:31:15.992 --> 00:31:19.099
&gt;
 

00:31:19.099 --> 00:31:20.048
Rest.
 

00:31:20.048 --> 00:31:23.422
&gt;
 

00:31:23.422 --> 00:31:26.170
&gt;
 

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:27.460
Louder.
 

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:31.211
&gt;
 

00:31:31.211 --> 00:31:34.269
&gt;
 

00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:37.240
Okay. We'll stop there.
 

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.443
So Bach's got this chorale and
then he's going to do something

00:31:40.443 --> 00:31:40.970
with it.
 

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:44.720
And what he does is write a
first movement,

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:50.167
so that takes us back over here
to movement one of our chorale

00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:51.240
cantata.
 

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:56.275
We're going to talk now about
the text with regard to this

00:31:56.275 --> 00:31:58.130
particular chorale.
 

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:59.509
What's the text calling about?
 

00:31:59.509 --> 00:32:02.042
Well, here's what--here's the
translation of it:

00:32:02.042 --> 00:32:03.713
"Awake,
a voice is calling,

00:32:03.713 --> 00:32:06.140
from the watchman from high in
the tower.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.720
Awake Jerusalem;
midnight is the hour.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.940
They call us with a clarion
voice.

00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:13.200
Where are the wise virgins?
 

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.769
Get up. The bridegroom cometh.
 

00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:17.740
Stand up and take your lamps.
 

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:18.262
Alleluia.
 

00:32:18.262 --> 00:32:20.240
Provide yourself for the
wedding.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:24.558
Go--you must go out--go forth
to meet him."

00:32:24.558 --> 00:32:29.167
Now in Bach's day,
this chorale would have been

00:32:29.167 --> 00:32:29.868
sung.
 

00:32:29.868 --> 00:32:33.509
It's the major musical portion
of the cantata,

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:37.000
which is the major musical
portion of the whole service,

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.390
and it was sung right after the
reading of the gospel.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.880
So they'd come in and there'd
be some introductory chorales

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.470
and prayers and that kind of
thing.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.352
Then they would have a reading
of the gospel,

00:32:49.352 --> 00:32:51.470
the thesis of the day.
 

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.740
Now this particular cantata is
written for Advent.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:56.250
So what's Advent?
 

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:57.750
Who can tell me what Advent is?
 

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.480
Don't necessarily--Muslim,
Jew, Christian,

00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:03.809
whatever, you may--probably
know what Advent is.

00:33:03.809 --> 00:33:04.180
Thaddeus.
 

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.088
Student: It's the days
before Christmas.

00:33:06.088 --> 00:33:07.630
Prof: It's the days
before Christmas.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.240
So we have the English word
"adventitious,"

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.548
something coming,
something about to arrive.

00:33:12.548 --> 00:33:14.880
It's the birth of Christ in
this particular case.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.759
So it's, I think roughly the
four weeks before Christmas.

00:33:17.759 --> 00:33:19.976
Think maybe late November,
early December,

00:33:19.976 --> 00:33:20.950
up to Christmas.
 

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:25.368
So that's when this cantata
would have been appropriate.

00:33:25.368 --> 00:33:28.265
It would have been sung say,
on the--on the Sunday,

00:33:28.265 --> 00:33:30.696
the first of December,
something like that,

00:33:30.696 --> 00:33:33.940
and as I say it's preceded by
the gospel of the day.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.292
So to get our heads in this we
have to understand what Bach's

00:33:37.292 --> 00:33:38.298
message is here.
 

00:33:38.298 --> 00:33:39.630
We have to know what the gospel
is.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:43.029
So I've asked Chris--I gave
Chris the textbook here.

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:46.468
I put it in the textbook and
asked Chris to read the gospel

00:33:46.468 --> 00:33:47.180
for today.
 

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.000
So stand up and--or--yeah.
 

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.980
Are you going to stand up?
 

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.250
Student: Then shall the
kingdom of heaven--"

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.451
Prof: Oh,
good.

00:33:54.451 --> 00:33:55.938
I like that,
nice and loud,

00:33:55.938 --> 00:33:57.140
the voice of God.
 

00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:59.105
Student: --be likened
unto ten virgins,

00:33:59.105 --> 00:34:01.858
which took their lamps and went
forth to meet the bridegroom.

00:34:01.858 --> 00:34:06.230
And five of them were wise and
five were foolish.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:10.155
They that were foolish took
their lamps but took no oil with

00:34:10.155 --> 00:34:13.150
them, and at midnight there was
a cry made.

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:15.639
Behold, the bridegroom cometh.
 

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:17.369
Go ye out to meet him.
 

00:34:17.369 --> 00:34:21.559
Then all those virgins arose
and trimmed their lamps,

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:23.760
and the foolish said unto the
wise,

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.617
'Give us of your oil for our
lamps are gone out,' but the

00:34:27.617 --> 00:34:30.570
wise answered,
saying, 'Not so;

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:34.452
lest there be not enough for us
and you, but go ye rather to

00:34:34.452 --> 00:34:37.150
them that sell and buy for
yourselves.'

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:41.382
And while they went to buy the
bridegroom came and they that

00:34:41.382 --> 00:34:45.614
were ready went in with him to
the marriage and the door was

00:34:45.614 --> 00:34:46.260
shut.
 

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.949
Watch therefore,
for ye know neither the day nor

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:53.639
the hour wherein the son of man
cometh."

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:54.572
Prof: Okay.
 

00:34:54.572 --> 00:34:57.577
Excellent, and that's the King
James version of that so the

00:34:57.577 --> 00:35:00.739
syntax is sometimes difficult
and the verbiage is a little bit

00:35:00.739 --> 00:35:01.880
unexpected there.
 

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.420
But what does all this mean?
 

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.550
What is this? Roger?
 

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:07.789
Student: It's the second
coming of Christ.

00:35:07.789 --> 00:35:10.554
Prof: The second coming
of Christ.

00:35:10.554 --> 00:35:11.039
Okay.
 

00:35:11.039 --> 00:35:12.789
And what are we supposed to do?
 

00:35:12.789 --> 00:35:16.110
We, good citizens of Leipzig,
what are we supposed to do?

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:16.880
Student: Be ready.
 

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.630
Prof: Be ready,
get our spiritual house in

00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:23.632
order because Christ is coming,
so Bach has this idea of this

00:35:23.632 --> 00:35:27.170
powerful figure coming into the
midst of Leipzig.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:30.360
And he creates the following
kind of music.

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:35.360
We start out here with
&gt;

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.389
and then it begins to move a
little bit in pitch.

00:35:37.389 --> 00:35:40.927
It's a good example of
something that we'll talk about

00:35:40.927 --> 00:35:43.599
in a moment,
but if we want to have the

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:46.489
sense of the inexorable march of
something,

00:35:46.489 --> 00:35:49.440
what better way than a
repeating bass line?

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:55.389
Then we have a melody begin
&gt;

00:35:55.389 --> 00:36:00.612
and then we didn't have
time--we have a C motive that we

00:36:00.612 --> 00:36:05.170
wanted to put up here--
&gt;.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:08.726
So when you read your textbook
there, I interpreted this as

00:36:08.726 --> 00:36:09.340
follows.
 

00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:12.684
You will hear someone saying,
i.e., me saying,

00:36:12.684 --> 00:36:16.996
that this is the inexorable
march of the Lord coming to the

00:36:16.996 --> 00:36:18.780
citizens of Leipzig.
 

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.931
They get very excited and they
begin to run in his direction,

00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:26.460
and this is the--Bach didn't
write all this down;

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.059
I'm kind of interpreting it
this way,

00:36:28.059 --> 00:36:32.643
but I can't help but think back
on the early session that we had

00:36:32.643 --> 00:36:36.644
talking about the musical
Chicago and that number

00:36:36.644 --> 00:36:39.170
in Chicago,
"get the gun,

00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:41.815
the gun,"
&gt;

00:36:41.815 --> 00:36:46.501
, and it gets faster and faster
and the texture gets denser and

00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:47.409
denser.
 

00:36:47.409 --> 00:36:49.510
Well, that's exactly what Bach
is doing here.

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:52.423
Whether it's Broadway or Bach,
the modus operandi is

00:36:52.423 --> 00:36:53.579
going to be the same.
 

00:36:53.579 --> 00:36:55.869
So let's listen to just a
little bit here.

00:36:55.869 --> 00:37:00.210
This is the opening movement of
Bach's cantata "Wachet auf,

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.139
ruft uns die Stimme."
 

00:37:02.139 --> 00:37:55.250
&gt;
 

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.460
Okay.
 

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.719
We're going to stop it there.
 

00:37:56.719 --> 00:37:58.230
That's just the opening phrase.
 

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:01.708
The crowd's coming in there
with little fugal expositions

00:38:01.708 --> 00:38:03.603
underneath that,
"who?",

00:38:03.603 --> 00:38:04.989
"where?",
coming where?,

00:38:04.989 --> 00:38:06.880
sort of this busy counterpoint
underneath.

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.992
I used to use this as a
Listening Exercise but it didn't

00:38:09.992 --> 00:38:10.389
work.
 

00:38:10.389 --> 00:38:14.369
It was too--I couldn't get--the
students couldn't--I don't know.

00:38:14.369 --> 00:38:17.690
It just was too complex and in
a way it told me something.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:19.829
Bach's music is very complex.
 

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:22.974
So I went on to a more
straightforward movement and

00:38:22.974 --> 00:38:26.625
that's what we're going to do
now, the fourth movement that

00:38:26.625 --> 00:38:28.449
incorporates the chorale.
 

00:38:28.449 --> 00:38:31.356
So we have the chorale,
sort of like the voice of God,

00:38:31.356 --> 00:38:32.289
up here on top.
 

00:38:32.289 --> 00:38:35.300
Let's go on to the fourth
movement that you may well

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.010
recognize.
 

00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:38.538
It's one of Bach's most famous
compositions,

00:38:38.538 --> 00:38:40.949
and I have four questions for
you here.

00:38:40.949 --> 00:38:42.860
What's the bass doing?
 

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:46.130
How many voices are there?
 

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:48.487
How many lines,
strands, do you hear in the

00:38:48.487 --> 00:38:49.050
texture?
 

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.639
And where is the chorale tune?
 

00:38:52.639 --> 00:38:54.360
Who's singing the chorale tune?
 

00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:57.480
So this is movement four of
cantata "Wachet auf."

00:38:57.480 --> 00:40:15.550
&gt;
 

00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.539
And then the ritornello starts
again;

00:40:18.539 --> 00:40:20.099
this refrain theme starts all
over again.

00:40:20.099 --> 00:40:21.309
&gt;
 

00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:22.219
All right. Let's pause it there.
 

00:40:22.219 --> 00:40:24.539
So what kind of bass do we have
here?

00:40:24.539 --> 00:40:28.909
It's called walking bass. Right.
 

00:40:28.909 --> 00:40:31.914
We've talked about that before,
and, once again,

00:40:31.914 --> 00:40:34.730
it gives a very sort of secure
foundation.

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:44.007
So we have a basso continuo
playing a walking bass,

00:40:44.007 --> 00:40:47.902
&gt;
 

00:40:47.902 --> 00:40:53.469
&gt;
 

00:40:53.469 --> 00:40:56.186
something like that,
just going on and on sort of

00:40:56.186 --> 00:40:58.902
with the same note values,
tends to be step-wise,

00:40:58.902 --> 00:41:00.599
have the same note values.
 

00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:03.219
What else did we need to know
there?

00:41:03.219 --> 00:41:04.480
What happened to the chorale?
 

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.320
Well, first of all,
what about the texture?

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.170
How many strands did you hear
in that texture?

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.664
Brian and Nicole,
you want to huddle up there and

00:41:12.664 --> 00:41:15.869
figure out what the answer to
this one is?

00:41:15.869 --> 00:41:16.909
What do you think?
 

00:41:16.909 --> 00:41:19.190
Nicole, how many strands?
 

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:20.489
How many lines did you hear
there?

00:41:20.489 --> 00:41:23.840
 
 

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.211
Okay.
 

00:41:24.211 --> 00:41:28.384
Well, we've got the bass in
there and we had that lovely,

00:41:28.384 --> 00:41:31.289
lovely melody,
&gt;

00:41:31.289 --> 00:41:35.228
which you have on your sheet
there, so that's two,

00:41:35.228 --> 00:41:37.559
and what was the third one?
 

00:41:37.559 --> 00:41:42.190
Well, the chorale tune
&gt;

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.679
but what was different about
the chorale tune this time?

00:41:45.679 --> 00:41:46.820
It was easier to hear.
 

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:47.920
Why?
 

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.710
'Cause all of the male voices
were singing it together in

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:53.480
unison.
 

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:57.166
It wasn't distributed in all
this counterpoint in all of the

00:41:57.166 --> 00:41:57.730
voices.
 

00:41:57.730 --> 00:42:01.070
All of the lines--all of the
voices were singing it together.

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:04.682
And if you have this sheet
here, I think the miracle of

00:42:04.682 --> 00:42:08.496
this particular sheet is that
this guy had this one melody

00:42:08.496 --> 00:42:10.170
&gt;
 

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:13.306
and he said,
"Gee whiz,

00:42:13.306 --> 00:42:17.139
if I went &gt;
 

00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:20.050
I could have that go against
this melody."

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:24.128
He thought--he had one nice
melody and he thought up an even

00:42:24.128 --> 00:42:28.068
more beautiful melody that could
interweave with his given

00:42:28.068 --> 00:42:28.829
melody.
 

00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:32.869
So that's the gift here,
to be able to hear one thing

00:42:32.869 --> 00:42:37.610
and size up its implications,
to know what it could become.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.603
I guess that's what a great
creative artist is all about,

00:42:40.603 --> 00:42:42.530
to know what something can
become.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:43.266
All right.
 

00:42:43.266 --> 00:42:47.471
So we have that particular
movement and I think that's the

00:42:47.471 --> 00:42:51.969
basis of your Listening Exercise
twenty-two for next time.

00:42:51.969 --> 00:42:56.313
Now we're getting toward the
end of our hour and I want to

00:42:56.313 --> 00:42:59.360
ask you--well,
we're going to do two more

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.199
things.
 

00:43:00.199 --> 00:43:01.989
One, we're going to come back
at the end--

00:43:01.989 --> 00:43:05.411
to the end of the cantata,
but I want to ask you a

00:43:05.411 --> 00:43:07.882
question about--
just try to put yourself in

00:43:07.882 --> 00:43:09.409
Bach's shoes here for the
moment.

00:43:09.409 --> 00:43:13.516
You got this job as a composer
and you got to generate all this

00:43:13.516 --> 00:43:13.913
music.
 

00:43:13.913 --> 00:43:14.510
Right?
 

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:17.757
You got to generate twenty-five
to thirty minutes of new music

00:43:17.757 --> 00:43:18.449
every week.
 

00:43:18.449 --> 00:43:22.010
Well, that would be like--all
right.

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:24.085
So presumably you get Sunday
afternoon off,

00:43:24.085 --> 00:43:26.159
watch football,
whatever you want to do.

00:43:26.159 --> 00:43:28.762
Then Monday morning you start
all over again,

00:43:28.762 --> 00:43:32.077
and by next Sunday morning you
got to have twenty-five to

00:43:32.077 --> 00:43:34.739
thirty minutes of music ready to
perform.

00:43:34.739 --> 00:43:36.639
Why is that really hard?
 

00:43:36.639 --> 00:43:38.750
What's the hard part of this?
 

00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:40.980
What's the time-consuming part
of all of this?

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:45.159
I see Roger and Elizabeth.
 

00:43:45.159 --> 00:43:47.000
Elizabeth, go with it.
 

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:47.369
Student: Writing it out.
 

00:43:47.369 --> 00:43:50.940
Prof: Writing it out,
yeah, probably not composing

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:51.260
it.
 

00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:54.621
I think these composers just
have this stuff spewing out of

00:43:54.621 --> 00:43:55.840
their ears nonstop.
 

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:58.802
I don't think it was thinking
it up and maybe not rehearsing

00:43:58.802 --> 00:44:00.760
it, though that would take some
time.

00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:03.380
But before the days of
photocopying machines,

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.737
it would be very laborious to
copy the full score and all of

00:44:07.737 --> 00:44:10.458
these parts ,
maybe fourteen different lines

00:44:10.458 --> 00:44:12.672
simultaneously,
and multiple copies of the

00:44:12.672 --> 00:44:15.670
violin parts and the cello parts
and this kind of thing--

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:17.239
so it'd be very time consuming.
 

00:44:17.239 --> 00:44:18.590
How did he do this?
 

00:44:18.590 --> 00:44:21.704
Well, let's see if we can go
back to the next slide here and

00:44:21.704 --> 00:44:24.239
we're going to talk about this
just for a bit.

00:44:24.239 --> 00:44:28.469
How did Bach execute this and
the next--Raoul,

00:44:28.469 --> 00:44:31.289
I think there was the--yeah.
 

00:44:31.289 --> 00:44:34.885
So we're going to go back into
our church here and we're going

00:44:34.885 --> 00:44:39.347
to see Bach's church where his--
the floor plan here and then

00:44:39.347 --> 00:44:42.838
we're going to--
next slide, please--take a look

00:44:42.838 --> 00:44:46.643
at the inside of it where the
sermon was preached and take a

00:44:46.643 --> 00:44:48.900
note of the high altar up there.
 

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:49.445
Next slide.
 

00:44:49.445 --> 00:44:51.679
We're going to go through these
quickly now.

00:44:51.679 --> 00:44:55.210
There we have the west end up
there where the organ is.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:56.989
That's where the cantata would
be performed.

00:44:56.989 --> 00:45:00.420
Next slide. The organ up there.
 

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.489
Here's a question for you.
 

00:45:01.489 --> 00:45:03.530
Is this an organ from Bach's
day?

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:04.730
Next slide.
 

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:08.159
Does that look like Bach's
organ?

00:45:08.159 --> 00:45:11.121
No, too many mechanical--kind
of mechanical contrivances there

00:45:11.121 --> 00:45:13.648
so that's a organ from the
beginning of the twentieth

00:45:13.648 --> 00:45:15.576
century,
and Bach's organ would have

00:45:15.576 --> 00:45:18.409
looked far more like this and
we're going to talk about this

00:45:18.409 --> 00:45:20.139
in section a little bit later
on.

00:45:20.139 --> 00:45:24.648
Moving on, let's go back to
this, because this is the

00:45:24.648 --> 00:45:29.679
building that we saw before,
the place where Bach lived.

00:45:29.679 --> 00:45:34.094
If we look at it now and start
counting up, we see that now

00:45:34.094 --> 00:45:38.280
there are five stories before we
reach the roof line.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.949
In 1731, Bach petitioned the
town council because of his

00:45:41.949 --> 00:45:46.021
large family to take the roof
off of this building and provide

00:45:46.021 --> 00:45:49.233
him with more space,
more space because he had all

00:45:49.233 --> 00:45:51.902
of these children,
he had relatives and he had

00:45:51.902 --> 00:45:54.039
students living in these
quarters,

00:45:54.039 --> 00:45:57.039
and what did they do to earn
their keep?

00:45:57.039 --> 00:45:59.768
Well, they copied music for him.
 

00:45:59.768 --> 00:46:01.434
So this is sort of,
if you will,

00:46:01.434 --> 00:46:03.690
the corporate headquarters of
Bach, Inc.

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.809
This is where all this great
music is being generated from.

00:46:06.809 --> 00:46:10.780
His wife, Anna Magdalena Bach,
was his principal copyist.

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:11.704
All right.
 

00:46:11.704 --> 00:46:14.849
So that's what--where they
lived.

00:46:14.849 --> 00:46:16.932
Now Bach, of course,
as mentioned,

00:46:16.932 --> 00:46:17.880
died in 1750.
 

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:21.378
Historians are profoundly
grateful to him for that because

00:46:21.378 --> 00:46:24.561
it gives us a nice,
clean cut-off by which to end

00:46:24.561 --> 00:46:28.639
the Baroque era--
end of Bach, end of Baroque.

00:46:28.639 --> 00:46:32.329
Died in 1750 of a stroke at age
sixty-five.

00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:35.452
At the time he wasn't thought
to be particularly important,

00:46:35.452 --> 00:46:38.306
so they relegated Bach's
remains to an outlying parish

00:46:38.306 --> 00:46:38.900
church.
 

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.760
As Mozart played Bach,
Beethoven played Bach,

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:45.489
Felix Mendelssohn played Bach,
people began to realize that,

00:46:45.489 --> 00:46:47.371
lo and behold,
they'd had a genius in their

00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:47.730
midst.
 

00:46:47.730 --> 00:46:51.329
So they exhume Bach to see if
he was a genius.

00:46:51.329 --> 00:46:52.269
Let's take a look at this.
 

00:46:52.269 --> 00:46:54.860
This is what they did in 1895.
 

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:57.971
They dug him up and they
photographed him because this

00:46:57.971 --> 00:47:01.260
was the period in which there
was a theory of genius--

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.840
interestingly enough,
that the genius had a smaller

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.489
brain than the normal human
being--

00:47:07.489 --> 00:47:09.268
not a larger brain but a
smaller brain.

00:47:09.268 --> 00:47:11.610
In any event,
Bach's brain turned out to be

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.619
just completely normal and this
was presumably a lot of

00:47:14.619 --> 00:47:17.067
nonsense,
but when they dug him up then

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.389
they repositioned him.
 

00:47:18.389 --> 00:47:22.590
And they repositioned him at
the high altar and this marker

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:26.429
here is now where the remains of
Bach are situated.

00:47:26.429 --> 00:47:30.780
And they tore out the
south-side bank of glass in the

00:47:30.780 --> 00:47:36.050
church and constructed based on
the portrait that you saw at the

00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:40.898
beginning of our hour--
that portrait--they constructed

00:47:40.898 --> 00:47:45.574
stained glass windows with
titles of some of Bach's works

00:47:45.574 --> 00:47:48.244
there,
so that the musical tourists

00:47:48.244 --> 00:47:50.295
such as myself--
or I hope you,

00:47:50.295 --> 00:47:54.177
someday--will go to Leipzig to
enjoy the wonderful music of

00:47:54.177 --> 00:47:57.190
this city and the wonderful
music of Bach.

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:59.320
Now the last thing we're going
to do on our way out--

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:03.153
the way the cantata would end
is that the entire congregation

00:48:03.153 --> 00:48:06.923
would stand up and everybody
together would sing the chorale

00:48:06.923 --> 00:48:07.500
tune.
 

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:10.405
We're not going to do that
'cause you already did that,

00:48:10.405 --> 00:48:13.471
but we'll just play this music
as you go out to give you a

00:48:13.471 --> 00:48:15.570
sense of how the service would
end.

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:32.550
&gt;
 

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:42.000

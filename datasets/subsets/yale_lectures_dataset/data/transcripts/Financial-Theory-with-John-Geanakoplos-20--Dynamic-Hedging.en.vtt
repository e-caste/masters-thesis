00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.260
Prof: The subject of
today's lecture is hedging.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.760
So this is what hedge funds do.
 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.000
It's what almost everyone on
Wall Street does nowadays,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.059
at least to some extent,
say half the people on Wall

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.260
Street nowadays.
 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.750
It was hardly done at all in
the past.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.755
So first of all,
just to mention what a hedge

00:00:24.755 --> 00:00:29.580
fund is, a hedge fund is a firm
that manages money.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.110
And why is it different from
any other firm that manages

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.479
money?
 

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.320
Well, the definition of hedge
fund basically has three parts.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.120
One is that hedge funds hedge.
 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.840
Now I'll say what that is in a
second.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.490
Secondly, hedge funds use
borrowed money in addition to

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.850
their investors' money to buy
assets.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.494
So they do what's called
leveraging, which is going to be

00:00:52.494 --> 00:00:55.470
an important subject for the
last few lectures of the course.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.381
And thirdly,
they charge their investors

00:00:58.381 --> 00:00:59.650
very high fees.
 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.469
That's basically the definition
of a hedge fund,

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.369
because they're supposed to be
so good at what they do,

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:07.129
they can charge high fees and
still get the investors.

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:09.078
So what is hedging?
 

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:14.846
Hedging is the idea that you
want to cancel out some of your

00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:15.629
risks.
 

00:01:15.629 --> 00:01:18.441
So for instance,
you might know that a company's

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:21.495
not going to default,
whereas the rest of the market

00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:23.530
thinks it is going to default.
 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.114
So you know the company's worth
more than the rest of the market

00:01:27.114 --> 00:01:30.129
thinks, so you might be tempted
to buy the company.

00:01:30.129 --> 00:01:33.489
But if the interest rate were
to change,

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:35.730
say go way up and the company's
paying,

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.590
has constant cash payments,
if the interest rate goes way

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.970
up and the company has constant
cash payments,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.280
you could end up losing money
anyway,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.340
because the present value's
going to go down,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.120
just because the interest rate
has gone up.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.819
So what a hedger would do is,
the hedger would say,

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.405
"Look, I'm relying on my
expertise as an evaluator to

00:01:56.405 --> 00:01:59.140
realize there's no default risk.
 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.140
I want to bet that there's no
default risk in this company.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.120
It's not going to default.
 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.906
I don't want to bet on which
way interest rates are going to

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:08.336
go,
because I don't know which way

00:02:08.336 --> 00:02:11.010
interest rates are going to go,
so I want to hedge myself

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.139
against that."
 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:19.060
So to take-- sorry,
I'm just starting here.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.580
Hello.
 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.490
Sorry, hard to talk when
everyone else is talking.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.750
So what does hedging a risk
means?

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.494
It means no matter which way
the risk factor goes,

00:02:33.494 --> 00:02:36.910
you're going to still end up
with the same amount of money.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.573
So the first person to do this
and call himself a hedge fund

00:02:41.573 --> 00:02:46.473
was somebody named Jones in the
1940s and he was a stock picker

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:50.979
who would try to find the best
possible stock to buy.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:52.601
So before him,
people would say,

00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:54.849
"Okay, Ford is a great
auto company.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.840
We're going to buy Ford."
 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.930
The trouble is that Ford may in
fact turn out to be the best

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.907
auto company,
but because the whole economy

00:03:03.907 --> 00:03:06.491
collapsed,
it may be that Ford collapsed

00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:10.055
with the rest of the economy,
even though it did better than

00:03:10.055 --> 00:03:11.680
all the other auto companies.
 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.959
So what Jones said is,
"I'm not going to just buy

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:14.258
Ford.
 

00:03:14.258 --> 00:03:16.860
What I'm going to do is,
I'm going to buy Ford and I'm

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.921
going to sell General Motors,
so that way I'm going to be

00:03:19.921 --> 00:03:23.240
betting not on whether Ford is
better than General Motors,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.483
and in addition,
whether the whole economy's

00:03:25.483 --> 00:03:26.370
going to go up.
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.114
I only want to bet on whether
Ford is better than General

00:03:29.114 --> 00:03:29.848
Motors."
 

00:03:29.848 --> 00:03:32.776
So if the whole economy goes
down, Ford and General Motors

00:03:32.776 --> 00:03:34.008
will go down together.
 

00:03:34.008 --> 00:03:37.263
So what you own in Ford,
you won't own something as

00:03:37.263 --> 00:03:40.144
valuable any more,
but what you owe by having sold

00:03:40.144 --> 00:03:42.490
General Motors short also won't
be as valuable.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.395
So what you've bought and what
you've sold will cancel each

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:47.699
other out and you won't have
lost any money.

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.129
On the other hand,
if Ford ends up doing better

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.664
than General Motors,
you'll have gained more with

00:03:52.664 --> 00:03:55.360
Ford than you'll have lost with
General Motors.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.710
So whether the economy goes up
or down,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.788
if the gap between Ford and
General Motors stays the same,

00:04:00.788 --> 00:04:04.472
you won't lose or win money,
so you're hedged against

00:04:04.472 --> 00:04:06.810
general changes in the economy.
 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.455
You're only going to make or
lose money depending on the

00:04:09.455 --> 00:04:11.430
spread between Ford and General
Motors.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.996
So you've canceled out the
economy wide risk and you're

00:04:13.996 --> 00:04:16.324
only holding one risk,
which you really think that

00:04:16.324 --> 00:04:17.370
you've understood.
 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.209
So that's what hedging is.
 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.045
So I'm going to now show you
that hedging is actually a

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:24.410
slightly delicate thing.
 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.372
It's quite complicated and
we're going to learn the

00:04:30.372 --> 00:04:34.069
technique of dynamic hedging.
 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.569
Now why is dynamic hedging so
important?

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.041
Dynamic hedging is so important
because there are so many things

00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:43.492
that can happen in the future,
and as I said,

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:45.209
for example,
if you hold a mortgage,

00:04:45.209 --> 00:04:47.339
you may think the mortgage is
more valuable,

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:49.149
because you know people aren't
going to default,

00:04:49.149 --> 00:04:51.329
and the rest of the economy
thinks they're going to default.

00:04:51.329 --> 00:04:53.374
On the other hand,
the value of the mortgage will

00:04:53.374 --> 00:04:55.973
change with the interest rate,
so you want to protect yourself

00:04:55.973 --> 00:04:57.550
against the interest rate
change.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:01.019
But it's not just the
interest rate change.

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:03.547
Over ten years or 30 years,
the life of the mortgage,

00:05:03.547 --> 00:05:06.610
there are going to be a huge
number of interest rate changes.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.235
There'll be a whole path of
interest rate changes,

00:05:09.235 --> 00:05:12.504
and the mortgage will be paying
different cash flows along the

00:05:12.504 --> 00:05:13.310
whole path.
 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.862
In over 30 years,
even if you think of only one

00:05:15.862 --> 00:05:18.233
change a day,
there's an exponentially

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:20.939
growing set of changes,
so there's an exponential

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:21.730
number of paths.
 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.935
You'll never be able to
equalize your cash flows,

00:05:24.935 --> 00:05:27.740
you would think,
over every single path.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.160
There are just too many of them.
 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.788
But dynamic hedging says you
don't have to equalize over

00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:35.230
every path from the very
beginning.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.959
That is, you don't have to hold
a portfolio at the very

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:40.944
beginning that equalizes your
cash flows by the end of every

00:05:40.944 --> 00:05:41.399
path.
 

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:45.255
You only have to equalize your
cash flow one step at a time and

00:05:45.255 --> 00:05:47.620
then dynamically change your
hedge,

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.656
so it's a much easier thing to
hedge than it sounds at first

00:05:50.656 --> 00:05:51.120
glance.
 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.423
So I want to illustrate that,
because you can't know what

00:05:53.423 --> 00:05:55.110
that means yet until we see an
example.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.889
So let's start with a very easy
thing to understand,

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.290
the World Series,
where we started before.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.639
So you have some expertise,
in fact, there are other people

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:07.278
besides you who have the same
expertise, these other bookies.

00:06:07.278 --> 00:06:10.235
You all know the Yankees have a
60 percent chance of winning

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:13.117
every game against the Phillies,
and let's just assume for

00:06:13.117 --> 00:06:15.918
simplicity that the World Series
is only going to take a couple

00:06:15.918 --> 00:06:16.459
of weeks.
 

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:19.290
The interest rate is 0 over
such a short period of time.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.983
You don't care whether you get
the money now or at the end of 2

00:06:22.983 --> 00:06:25.129
weeks, just so long as you get
it.

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:29.310
You can borrow or lend at 0
interest over those short number

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.019
of days.
 

00:06:30.019 --> 00:06:34.305
And secondly,
you know that the probability

00:06:34.305 --> 00:06:37.060
of winning is 60 percent.
 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.464
Now suppose that some naive
person comes to you and says,

00:06:41.464 --> 00:06:43.589
"I'm a Phillies fan.
 

00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:46.925
I want to bet at even odds that
the Phillies are going to win

00:06:46.925 --> 00:06:48.259
for 100 dollars."
 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.714
So you're going to now get a
payoff that's -100 dollars at

00:06:52.714 --> 00:06:56.310
the end of game 7,
assuming I counted right.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.290
So this is the start.
 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.887
This would be game 1 here,
so it's 1,2,

00:07:03.887 --> 00:07:05.949
3,4, 5,6, 7.
 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.399
So by the end of game 7,
if you played it to the end,

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:13.898
you would have made 100 dollars
if the Yankees won a majority of

00:07:13.898 --> 00:07:16.603
the games,
and you'd have lost 100 dollars

00:07:16.603 --> 00:07:19.870
if the Yankees didn't win a
majority of the games.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.639
So how much is that worth to
you?

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.649
Well obviously it's worth a lot
more than 20 dollars,

00:07:25.649 --> 00:07:28.175
because if they only played 1
game and the Yankees had a 60

00:07:28.175 --> 00:07:30.956
percent chance of winning,
the expected payoff for the

00:07:30.956 --> 00:07:34.634
Yankees,
that bet for 1 game would be 20

00:07:34.634 --> 00:07:38.545
dollars,
because you know in 1 game a .6

00:07:38.545 --> 00:07:42.389
chance of 100 and a .4 chance of
- 100,

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:45.810
that gives you an expectation
of 20.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.480
60 - 40 is 20.
 

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.370
However, we're playing a seven
game series.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.995
The whole point of playing a
long series is that the Yankees

00:07:51.995 --> 00:07:53.110
are more likely to win.
 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.079
The better team is more likely
to win,

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:57.264
and in fact,
we know that by doing this

00:07:57.264 --> 00:08:01.122
backward induction calculation,
we know that the expected

00:08:01.122 --> 00:08:04.170
winnings for the Yankees is 42
dollars.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.500
However, the Yankees--you could
lose 100 dollars.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.223
If the Phillies just got lucky,
you could lose as well as win

00:08:10.223 --> 00:08:10.860
100 dollars.
 

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.129
You don't want to face that
risk, so what could you do?

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:19.547
Well, the simplest thing to do
is to go to another bookie and

00:08:19.547 --> 00:08:21.408
say,
"I want to bet on the

00:08:21.408 --> 00:08:23.490
World Series,"
with this other bookie.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:29.853
So if the bookie is willing to
make a bet with you for the

00:08:29.853 --> 00:08:33.333
whole series,
so the bookie has to be pretty

00:08:33.333 --> 00:08:35.820
sophisticated and do the same
calculation,

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:41.424
the bookie is going to let you
bet however you want to at the

00:08:41.424 --> 00:08:42.639
right odds.
 

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:46.659
So what would you do?
 

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:47.850
So here you can win 100.
 

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:49.558
There are only two outcomes.
 

00:08:49.558 --> 00:08:54.259
You can win 100 or you can lose
100.

00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:58.511
Now the odds of winning the
series, I forgot to say,

00:08:58.511 --> 00:09:00.929
we figured this out before.
 

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:03.440
Oh dear, what were the odds?
 

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.149
Hope I have another one of
these World Series things.

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:13.351
Okay, so what are the odds that
the Yankees are going to win the

00:09:13.351 --> 00:09:14.590
World Series?
 

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.750
We calculated this before.
 

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.360
Do you remember what it was?
 

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.038
Well, we know some probability
P times 100 some probability (1

00:09:25.038 --> 00:09:27.460
- P), -100 gives you 42.
 

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:35.919
So P times 100 (1 - P) times -
100 = 42 approximately.

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:37.320
That's 42, right?
 

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:48.565
So we know that therefore,
2P times 100 = 142,

00:09:48.565 --> 00:10:02.058
so P = 142 over 100 times 2,
which equals about .71.

00:10:02.058 --> 00:10:04.904
Okay, so this other bookie
would have calculated the odds

00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.801
are 71 percent that the Yankees
are going to win the World

00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:08.360
Series.
 

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.769
We calculated this a few
classes ago.

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:14.018
The Yankees have a 71 percent
chance of winning the World

00:10:14.018 --> 00:10:14.538
Series.
 

00:10:14.538 --> 00:10:17.034
So if you went to another
bookie who could do this

00:10:17.034 --> 00:10:19.292
calculation,
the other bookie would be

00:10:19.292 --> 00:10:22.573
willing to give you odds of 71
percent Yankees versus 39

00:10:22.573 --> 00:10:24.423
percent [correction:
29 percent]

00:10:24.423 --> 00:10:26.855
Phillies,
so you could just unload this

00:10:26.855 --> 00:10:28.918
whole bet and get 42 dollars for
sure.

00:10:28.918 --> 00:10:35.110
In fact, what would you bet
with the other guy?

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:38.870
What would you bet with the
other bookie?

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.750
What would you do if you could
bet on the whole World Series?

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.769
Somebody suggested that.
 

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:43.908
He was sitting over there at
the end of the last class.

00:10:43.908 --> 00:10:46.908
What would you do if you could
bet on the whole World Series

00:10:46.908 --> 00:10:48.129
with the other bookie?
 

00:10:48.129 --> 00:10:49.500
What bet would you make?
 

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.538
You know that the bet is giving
you 42 dollars on expectation.

00:10:53.538 --> 00:10:55.408
The trouble is,
some of the time it's giving

00:10:55.408 --> 00:10:57.539
you 100, some of the time it's
giving you -100.

00:10:57.539 --> 00:10:58.840
You don't want to fix this risk.
 

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:01.980
You want to end up with 42
dollars for sure.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:09.000
Now how can you do that?
 

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.312
Well, if you did -68
[correction: -58]

00:11:13.312 --> 00:11:18.674
here, that would = 42,
and if you did 142 here,

00:11:18.674 --> 00:11:21.590
that would also = 42.
 

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.667
So could you figure out a way
of betting with the other

00:11:25.667 --> 00:11:27.480
bookies 142 versus 58?
 

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:32.197
You win 142 if the Phillies
win, and you lose 58 if the

00:11:32.197 --> 00:11:33.418
Yankees win?
 

00:11:33.418 --> 00:11:37.808
Student:
&gt;

00:11:37.808 --> 00:11:50.080
Prof: That's not 42 by
the way.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:58.429
Okay, would another bookie be
willing to give you this bet?

00:11:58.429 --> 00:12:00.250
What's the answer?
 

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:00.990
The answer is yes.
 

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:11.471
How do you know the other
bookie would be willing to give

00:12:11.471 --> 00:12:14.278
you this bet?
 

00:12:14.278 --> 00:12:20.700
What is P times 42 (1 - P)
times 42?

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:21.750
It's 42.
 

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.039
What's P times 100 (1 - P)
times -100.

00:12:25.039 --> 00:12:26.548
It's also 42.
 

00:12:26.548 --> 00:12:29.650
So therefore,
what's P times this (1 - P)

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.659
times that?
 

00:12:30.659 --> 00:12:33.779
Student: 0.
 

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:34.690
Prof: 0.
 

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.047
So at the odds,
P and 1 - P,

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:39.580
this bet is perfectly fair.
 

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.986
So the other bookie would say
that's the odds,

00:12:41.986 --> 00:12:43.700
71 percent to 39 [29]
percent.

00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:46.190
That's exactly what these odds
are.

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:49.472
So if P times this (1 - P)
times that is 42,

00:12:49.472 --> 00:12:53.748
and P times this (1 - P) times
that, that's obviously 42,

00:12:53.748 --> 00:12:57.490
must be P times this (1 - P)
times that is 0.

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.190
In other words,
at the odds,

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.140
P and 1 - P,
this is a fair bet,

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:04.288
so the other bookie would give
you those odds.

00:13:04.288 --> 00:13:08.230
So that's what's hedging is in
its simplest form.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:09.950
We haven't had to do anything
dynamic.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.984
Some guy is willing to bet on
the World Series with you,

00:13:12.984 --> 00:13:15.631
so you know that he's done
something wrong in his

00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:16.570
calculations.
 

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:20.090
He's got the wrong P,
so you can take advantage of

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.240
the situation.
 

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.428
You know that P is higher than
he does.

00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:25.898
On the other hand,
there's still God in the

00:13:25.898 --> 00:13:28.806
background and luck,
which might make the Phillies

00:13:28.806 --> 00:13:32.080
win, and so you don't want to
subject yourself to that risk.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.340
So what do you do?
 

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.558
You take the bet,
the advantageous bet,

00:13:36.558 --> 00:13:40.908
but you put together with the
advantageous bet a hedging bet,

00:13:40.908 --> 00:13:42.580
where you're betting on the
wrong team,

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.210
the team you think is going to
lose.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:45.720
But you're betting on the wrong
team,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.519
but this time,
at fair odds on the wrong team,

00:13:48.519 --> 00:13:51.450
and so you're transforming your
risky payoff,

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:58.360
albeit with very favorable
odds--P we just said was .71--

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.701
you're taking your risky payoff
and turning it into a safe

00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:04.700
payoff of 42,
no matter what.

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.629
That's the essence of hedging.
 

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:09.197
In order to do that,
you might have to bet the

00:14:09.197 --> 00:14:12.110
opposite way that you think is
going to turn out.

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:14.548
So there's principle number one.
 

00:14:14.548 --> 00:14:16.794
So let me pause and see if
there are any questions for

00:14:16.794 --> 00:14:17.600
that, about that.
 

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:21.830
The idea is that there's
something you know that you can

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:25.368
take advantage of,
but life is more complicated

00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:28.830
than knowing one thing,
namely what P is.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:32.870
Life also involves all kinds of
other things that might happen.

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:36.096
You want to insulate yourself
from those other things and

00:14:36.096 --> 00:14:39.438
concentrate entirely on what you
know about P and 1 - P and

00:14:39.438 --> 00:14:42.090
therefore assure yourself of a
bet of 42,

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:43.558
no matter what.
 

00:14:43.558 --> 00:14:47.100
And you're taking advantage of
the fact that other people will

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.190
also be able to bet at P with
you.

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:51.860
This one outsider doesn't
understand that all the bookies

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:54.673
are willing to take odds of P,
he's offering odds of 1 half,

00:14:54.673 --> 00:14:55.580
which is crazy.
 

00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.519
It's a big gap, 71,29 to P.
 

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:03.730
So you can take 42 of his
dollars for sure.

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:12.370
Okay, so now let's go to--okay,
this is hedging.

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:13.918
It's also an arbitrage.
 

00:15:13.918 --> 00:15:23.960
This is--hedging created a pure
arbitrage.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:27.102
In this case,
it's done even better than in

00:15:27.102 --> 00:15:30.626
my example with Ford,
because you've taken now a bet

00:15:30.626 --> 00:15:34.139
and transformed it with an
expectation you're going to win,

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:39.200
into a bet where you can't
possibly lose.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.711
Okay, now suppose that these
other brokers weren't as clever

00:15:43.711 --> 00:15:44.399
as you.
 

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:45.871
Suppose that the other
brokers--okay,

00:15:45.871 --> 00:15:46.690
so that's hedging.
 

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:48.668
Now we're going to do dynamic
hedging.

00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:51.450
Suppose the other brokers,
they're not as smart as you.

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.149
They don't know how to build
these trees.

00:15:53.149 --> 00:15:55.080
They can't do backward
induction.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.928
They just know the odds are 60
percent that the Yankees are

00:15:57.928 --> 00:16:00.139
going to win any game against
the Phillies.

00:16:00.139 --> 00:16:02.908
Now what would you do?
 

00:16:02.908 --> 00:16:04.798
Okay, you can't go to another
broker and say,

00:16:04.798 --> 00:16:07.158
"I want to bet on the
whole 7 game series."

00:16:07.158 --> 00:16:09.361
The guy's going to say,
"It's just too complicated

00:16:09.361 --> 00:16:09.730
for me.
 

00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.610
I'm a simple man.
 

00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.710
I make a simple living.
 

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.038
I just do 1 game bets.
 

00:16:14.038 --> 00:16:17.190
I'll let you bet any game you
want.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:20.774
You tell me what you want to
bet, we'll bet one game at a

00:16:20.774 --> 00:16:21.990
time, 60/40 odds.
 

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.283
The whole series,
it's much more complicated for

00:16:24.283 --> 00:16:24.820
me."
 

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.000
So is there anything you can do
now?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.690
What can you do now?
 

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:36.313
So now you have to do something
more complicated,

00:16:36.313 --> 00:16:39.590
which is called dynamic
hedging.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.402
So we started to talk about
this last time,

00:16:43.402 --> 00:16:45.490
so what would you do?
 

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:48.352
You only now have the
opportunity of protecting

00:16:48.352 --> 00:16:52.025
yourself against bad luck by
betting one game at a time with

00:16:52.025 --> 00:16:53.519
these other brokers.
 

00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:58.850
So what should you do?
 

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:03.470
Well, let's look at this
picture here.

00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:08.001
You know that this bet of (
100, -100) by doing backward

00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:09.980
induction is worth 42.
 

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:13.288
So if you were a trader,
a hedge fund manager,

00:17:13.288 --> 00:17:16.450
you would be marking your
position at 42.

00:17:16.450 --> 00:17:19.557
You're expecting now--you've
just made a trade which you know

00:17:19.557 --> 00:17:21.890
on average is going to make you
42 dollars.

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.494
Of course, if you had bad luck,
you could end up losing 100

00:17:24.494 --> 00:17:26.333
dollars,
which means you're going to go

00:17:26.333 --> 00:17:28.061
out of business,
you're going to be fired,

00:17:28.061 --> 00:17:29.650
your name's going to be in the
newspaper,

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.180
you're going to be probably
sued by your investors.

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:38.450
Or you can--we haven't been
sued by any investors.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:41.609
Or you might make 100 dollars.
 

00:17:41.609 --> 00:17:43.368
Now you don't want to face that.
 

00:17:43.368 --> 00:17:45.144
You want to hedge yourself,
protect yourself,

00:17:45.144 --> 00:17:46.960
so you're going to make the
money for sure.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.470
Now some people don't hedge.
 

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:51.482
They say when you hedge,
you're betting against

00:17:51.482 --> 00:17:54.170
yourself, and something bad can
happen.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:55.740
The hedge might go negative,
right?

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.404
It may be that the Yankees win,
just as you think,

00:17:58.404 --> 00:18:01.287
but because you've hedged,
you're not going to get 100

00:18:01.287 --> 00:18:01.940
dollars.
 

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.828
You're only going to get 42
dollars.

00:18:03.828 --> 00:18:06.938
So the essence of hedging is
you give something up on the

00:18:06.938 --> 00:18:09.269
upside to get something on the
downside.

00:18:09.269 --> 00:18:13.173
So people don't like hedging
because they're giving something

00:18:13.173 --> 00:18:13.500
up.
 

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.759
Okay, so you're giving
something up.

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:16.429
The point is,
you're getting something back

00:18:16.429 --> 00:18:18.257
on the downside,
and you're making it so you're

00:18:18.257 --> 00:18:19.329
locking in your profit.
 

00:18:19.329 --> 00:18:21.910
So hedging is a good thing.
 

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:24.967
So people who don't hedge I
think they're just very simple

00:18:24.967 --> 00:18:25.450
minded.
 

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:27.170
So there are a lot of people
who still don't hedge,

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.001
but anyway, there's a
revolution in financial thought

00:18:30.001 --> 00:18:32.388
in the last 30 years,
anticipated by Ford

00:18:32.388 --> 00:18:34.721
[correction: Jones],
but it didn't really

00:18:34.721 --> 00:18:37.804
get--people didn't really catch
on until the '70s that you

00:18:37.804 --> 00:18:38.670
should hedge.
 

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:42.141
So how can you hedge this if
you can only bet 1 time,

00:18:42.141 --> 00:18:43.410
1 game at a time?
 

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:45.180
That was the question we dealt
with last time.

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.450
What should you do?
 

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:52.002
Well, you see the principles
we've learned so far tell us

00:18:52.002 --> 00:18:53.058
what to do.
 

00:18:53.058 --> 00:18:56.403
You started here thinking on
average you're going to make 42

00:18:56.403 --> 00:18:56.970
dollars.
 

00:18:56.970 --> 00:19:00.638
You should be marking your
position correctly that it's

00:19:00.638 --> 00:19:01.930
worth 42 dollars.
 

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.660
Now if you win the first game,
you're at a big advantage.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:09.915
The Yankees are up a game and
by backward induction we know

00:19:09.915 --> 00:19:13.660
that then your position will be
worth 64 dollars.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.554
If you lose,
your position will be worth 8

00:19:16.554 --> 00:19:18.390
[correction: 9]
dollars.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:25.309
Now what is 60 percent of 64
plus 40 percent of 9?

00:19:25.309 --> 00:19:26.670
It's 42.
 

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:32.740
60 percent of 64 is 38.4.
 

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:38.138
So you're at 42 and you could
go with 60 percent probability

00:19:38.138 --> 00:19:42.165
to 60-- I can't even remember
the number--64,

00:19:42.165 --> 00:19:44.818
or down to .9,40 percent.
 

00:19:44.818 --> 00:19:49.210
Sorry, I'm getting senile,
9 with 40 percent probability.

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:58.575
So 60 percent times that is
38.4 40 percent of 9 is 3.6 and

00:19:58.575 --> 00:20:02.288
the two add up to 42.
 

00:20:02.288 --> 00:20:05.259
So that's why--so to say the
value's worth 42,

00:20:05.259 --> 00:20:06.910
how did you get the 42?
 

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.470
We were doing backward
induction.

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:12.960
We took 60 percent of that 40
percent of that and we got 42.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:14.930
So if you're marking yourself
to market,

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:16.730
after the first game of the
series,

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:20.506
you'll have to admit to the
world that you're either now

00:20:20.506 --> 00:20:22.922
worth 64 dollars,
or you've gotten crushed,

00:20:22.922 --> 00:20:24.381
and you're down to 8
[correction: 9]

00:20:24.381 --> 00:20:24.838
dollars.
 

00:20:24.838 --> 00:20:27.028
That already might get you
fired.

00:20:27.028 --> 00:20:29.607
Going from 42 to 8 [correction:
9], that's a pretty drastic

00:20:29.607 --> 00:20:29.920
loss.
 

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.529
So even the first day,
if you have to mark to market,

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:36.678
you're going to be revealing to
the world that you've screwed up

00:20:36.678 --> 00:20:38.348
and now your position's only 8
[correction: 9].

00:20:38.348 --> 00:20:40.708
You've told all your investors,
you've done this brilliant

00:20:40.708 --> 00:20:41.039
thing.
 

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:42.618
They're up 42 dollars.
 

00:20:42.618 --> 00:20:43.711
The next day,
you're going to have to tell

00:20:43.711 --> 00:20:44.884
them, "Well,
I'm sorry, you're only up 8

00:20:44.884 --> 00:20:45.789
[correction: 9]
dollars."

00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:47.430
They're going to be very upset.
 

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:56.680
So what would you do?
 

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.420
You know what to do.
 

00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:58.660
What would you do?
 

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.599
Student: Hedge.
 

00:21:02.599 --> 00:21:03.250
Prof: Hedge.
 

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.380
Good answer.
 

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.500
How would you hedge?
 

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:12.269
Student:
&gt;

00:21:12.269 --> 00:21:17.250
Prof: Right.
 

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:21.740
So what do you say?
 

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:28.480
This is 9, so you'd go ( 33,
-22).

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.430
So that's equal to 42 and
that's also equal to 42.

00:21:32.430 --> 00:21:34.019
Can you do this?
 

00:21:34.019 --> 00:21:36.470
Is it fair odds to do this?
 

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:39.682
Well, yes, it has to be fair
odds to do this,

00:21:39.682 --> 00:21:43.769
because 60 percent of 64 40
percent of 9 is indeed 42.

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:48.470
60 percent of 42 40 percent of
42 obviously is 42.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.166
So therefore the difference,
60 percent of this 40 percent

00:21:51.166 --> 00:21:52.869
of that must be 0,
so in other words,

00:21:52.869 --> 00:21:53.769
it's fair odds.
 

00:21:53.769 --> 00:21:56.597
And sure enough,
this is obviously 3 to 2 odds,

00:21:56.597 --> 00:21:57.088
right?
 

00:21:57.088 --> 00:21:59.150
60/40 means you're betting at 3
to 2 odds.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.380
That's 3 to 2 odds.
 

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.487
So it is a fair bet,
so the other bookie who's

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:05.390
willing to bet at 3 to 2 odds is
going to give you this bet.

00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:08.261
So again, you think the Yankees
are going to win,

00:22:08.261 --> 00:22:11.794
you make a bet with the naive
Philly fan, you're betting the

00:22:11.794 --> 00:22:13.528
Yankees are going to win.
 

00:22:13.528 --> 00:22:18.770
You go to your broker friend
and you bet against your

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.778
Yankees.
 

00:22:19.778 --> 00:22:23.201
You're going to lose 22 dollars
if the Yankees win,

00:22:23.201 --> 00:22:25.460
and win 33 if the Phillies win.
 

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.099
You're betting against
yourself, but of course you're

00:22:28.099 --> 00:22:30.892
betting against yourself to a
smaller extent than you're

00:22:30.892 --> 00:22:36.103
betting against the other guy,
and therefore you still locked

00:22:36.103 --> 00:22:37.818
in 42 dollars.
 

00:22:37.818 --> 00:22:40.538
So now we don't have to go any
further.

00:22:40.538 --> 00:22:43.019
It would only be confusing to
go further.

00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:45.412
I usually go further,
so it would just be

00:22:45.412 --> 00:22:46.250
complicated.
 

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.420
If you can do something once,
you can do it many times.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:56.844
So by making the right hedging
bet, you can lock in a profit up

00:22:56.844 --> 00:22:59.118
here and up here.
 

00:22:59.118 --> 00:23:03.868
But that means you can lock it
in going forward to the very

00:23:03.868 --> 00:23:08.290
end, because you can keep
repeating that hedge over and

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:09.519
over again.
 

00:23:09.519 --> 00:23:11.730
Maybe I'd better go one step
further.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.640
You don't really believe me.
 

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:16.368
So what could you do going from
here to here?

00:23:16.368 --> 00:23:22.528
Well, the average of here and
here is about 9.

00:23:22.528 --> 00:23:25.808
You've collected 33 dollars,
don't forget,

00:23:25.808 --> 00:23:27.730
from your hedging bet.
 

00:23:27.730 --> 00:23:30.807
So although this says 9,
you've got the 33 in the

00:23:30.807 --> 00:23:32.410
background, so it's 42.
 

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:33.460
But it's 9.
 

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:36.092
So what you want to do,
this is 9, you just want to

00:23:36.092 --> 00:23:37.828
transform this and this into 9.
 

00:23:37.828 --> 00:23:40.690
Once you've transformed this
and this into 9,

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:45.518
which you can do because 60
percent of this 40 percent of

00:23:45.518 --> 00:23:48.800
that is 9,
so the other broker--you can do

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:53.056
an offloading hedging bet with
another broker at 60/40 odds to

00:23:53.056 --> 00:23:54.660
get 9 for sure here.
 

00:23:54.660 --> 00:23:55.420
Why is that?
 

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:58.490
Because 60 percent of this 40
percent of that is 9,

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.480
so therefore there must be
offsetting--

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.720
a bet he'd take that gave you 9
for sure in both cases,

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.640
because the offsetting bet
would also be valued at 0

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.130
according to 60/40 odds.
 

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:13.406
So you can transform this and
this into 9s but don't forget,

00:24:13.406 --> 00:24:17.538
you've been paid the 33,
so actually this is 42 and 42.

00:24:17.538 --> 00:24:21.101
So you can keep 42 and 42 going
forever and by the end,

00:24:21.101 --> 00:24:22.750
you'll have 42 forever.
 

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.240
So that's what dynamic hedging
is.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.190
It's as simple as that.
 

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:27.390
Yes.
 

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:28.800
Student:
In order to make money with

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.650
hedging, wouldn't you have to
have someone who would bet

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:31.859
against you with different odds?
 

00:24:31.859 --> 00:24:32.298
Prof: Yes.
 

00:24:32.298 --> 00:24:37.318
So how do you make money in
hedging?

00:24:37.318 --> 00:24:43.362
You effectively were betting
against the Phillies fan at 50

00:24:43.362 --> 00:24:45.999
percent odds,
and you've got your broker

00:24:45.999 --> 00:24:47.640
who's willing to give you 60
percent odds,

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.450
and you're exploiting that gap.
 

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:56.598
So let's do another--excellent
question you're asking.

00:24:56.598 --> 00:24:58.200
I haven't answered his question
yet.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:00.288
I want to give another example
to answer his question.

00:25:00.288 --> 00:25:02.950
What is really going on with
the hedging?

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.038
What am I relying on?
 

00:25:05.038 --> 00:25:07.289
How many brokers do I have to
deal with to hedge?

00:25:07.289 --> 00:25:08.509
What's going on here?
 

00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:12.307
I've given an example of a
World Series where it's very

00:25:12.307 --> 00:25:14.700
simple to figure out what to do.
 

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:33.250
So now I want to give an
example of a bond.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.660
It doesn't matter what bond.
 

00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:42.880
I have to confess,
I haven't done this in advance.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:52.450
Here we have a 30-year bond,
8 percent 30-year bond.

00:25:52.450 --> 00:26:09.410
It's an 8 percent 30-year bond.
 

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:17.420
So we know what its payment is.
 

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:22.857
Homeowners are all perfectly
not paying attention,

00:26:22.857 --> 00:26:28.740
the bond is going to be worth
some amount of money.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.500
So here are the interest rates,
I forgot to say.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.950
So we have to assume what the
risk is.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:34.088
So in fact, what does this mean?
 

00:26:34.088 --> 00:26:41.957
We know that the risk is 6--the
interest rate starts at 6

00:26:41.957 --> 00:26:48.279
percent and it has a 20 percent
volatility.

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:49.608
So what does that tell us?
 

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:54.691
It tells us that the interest
rates could go up or down by

00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:55.940
this amount.
 

00:26:55.940 --> 00:27:00.837
Now, we've assumed that the
odds that it can go up or down

00:27:00.837 --> 00:27:01.868
are 50/50.
 

00:27:01.868 --> 00:27:05.131
So we've assumed that everybody
thinks the odds are 50/50 that

00:27:05.131 --> 00:27:07.269
the interest rate could go up or
down.

00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:10.202
That's an assumption,
and so now I'm going to

00:27:10.202 --> 00:27:13.269
make--we've assumed that the
odds are 50/50.

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:19.779
Let's assume that everybody is
willing to trade you 50/50 odds.

00:27:19.779 --> 00:27:27.009
So what does that mean?
 

00:27:27.009 --> 00:27:29.650
This is like your other broker.
 

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.740
So the interest rate is here,
r_0.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:38.807
It can go up to r_0
times up, or it can go down to

00:27:38.807 --> 00:27:42.098
r_0 times some down.
 

00:27:42.098 --> 00:27:45.045
Up remember,
is--up, by the way,

00:27:45.045 --> 00:27:51.220
this = r_0 e to the
volatility times e to the drift,

00:27:51.220 --> 00:27:58.230
and down = r_0 e to
the - volatility e to the drift.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.170
It doesn't matter.
 

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:02.118
r_0 can go up or it
can go down.

00:28:02.118 --> 00:28:04.920
So U is bigger than 1,
D is less than 1 probably.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.130
So we see examples of that.
 

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.950
Now I'm making an assumption
here that the odds are 1 half

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:14.836
and 1 half and that everybody
understands and is willing to

00:28:14.836 --> 00:28:17.720
bet on these odds of 1 half and
1 half.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:28.030
So betting on an interest rate
move is called--that kind of

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:37.275
betting on interest rates means
trading interest rate

00:28:37.275 --> 00:28:40.118
derivatives.
 

00:28:40.118 --> 00:28:43.679
So there are a bunch of ways
that you can trade in the

00:28:43.679 --> 00:28:47.775
interest rate market to get 1
dollar if the interest rate goes

00:28:47.775 --> 00:28:51.691
up to this number,
in exchange for losing 1 dollar

00:28:51.691 --> 00:28:54.140
if it goes down to this number.
 

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:56.832
And these things are called
swaps and they're called

00:28:56.832 --> 00:28:59.999
interest rate derivatives and
they're called a whole bunch of

00:28:59.999 --> 00:29:02.243
other things,
which it's going to take too

00:29:02.243 --> 00:29:03.028
long to explain.
 

00:29:03.028 --> 00:29:06.910
So let's suppose that you can
go out into the interest rate

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:10.789
derivative market and simply
trade a security that'll pay 1

00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:14.670
dollar if things go up or you
can buy another security that

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.480
will pay 1 dollar if things go
down.

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.868
Now what is the price of this
security that pays a dollar if

00:29:20.868 --> 00:29:22.420
the interest rates go up?
 

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.130
Let's say they can only go up
or down to one of two values.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:29.299
So what would be the cost if
everyone agrees the odds are 50

00:29:29.299 --> 00:29:31.348
percent of getting up here?
 

00:29:31.348 --> 00:29:35.080
What is the price today going
to be of getting 1 dollar if the

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.548
interest rate goes up?
 

00:29:36.548 --> 00:29:41.950
Student:
X divided by the interest rate.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:42.390
Prof: Excellent.
 

00:29:42.390 --> 00:29:43.420
Who said that?
 

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:44.380
Perfect.
 

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.875
I didn't expect anyone to say
that so fast,

00:29:46.875 --> 00:29:47.529
so right.
 

00:29:47.529 --> 00:29:52.920
So the price here,
we could write is .5 divided by

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:57.980
(1 r_0),
and this price going down is

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:03.259
going to be .5 divided by (1
r_0).

00:30:03.259 --> 00:30:05.200
How did he figure that out?
 

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.308
Well, the odds are 50 percent
of going up here and 50 percent

00:30:08.308 --> 00:30:10.295
of going down here,
but don't forget,

00:30:10.295 --> 00:30:13.326
you're getting the money later
and this is a 1 period interest

00:30:13.326 --> 00:30:14.568
rate, 1 r_0.
 

00:30:14.568 --> 00:30:17.115
So therefore,
what you'd be willing to pay

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:20.097
here is 50 percent of the dollar
that you'll get,

00:30:20.097 --> 00:30:22.210
discounted by 1 r_0.
 

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:26.432
What you paid here for that is
50 percent of the dollar you'd

00:30:26.432 --> 00:30:29.319
be paid, discounted by 1
r_0.

00:30:29.319 --> 00:30:32.380
So, exactly right.
 

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.923
But now these are like the
World Series,

00:30:35.923 --> 00:30:37.740
game by game odds.
 

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:39.990
They're going to change
depending on where you are in

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.169
the tree,
because if you go here in the

00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:44.211
tree,
you've got a higher interest

00:30:44.211 --> 00:30:47.669
rate, so it's going to be .5
divided by (1 r_U) or

00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:49.848
something,
which is a bigger number.

00:30:49.848 --> 00:30:52.660
So the price of betting on 1
dollar--

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.316
what you have to pay to get 1
dollar if interest rates go up

00:30:56.316 --> 00:30:58.607
is going to be more [correction:
less]

00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:01.313
here than it is here,
say, because you're going to

00:31:01.313 --> 00:31:03.150
still have 50 percent chance of
getting here,

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:05.180
but you're discounting by a
higher interest rate.

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.098
So it's slightly subtler,
but not much.

00:31:08.098 --> 00:31:11.828
It's like the broker in the
World Series who game by game,

00:31:11.828 --> 00:31:14.630
day by day, there's the
interest rate derivative market,

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.767
and they're willing to trade
you, they're willing to let you

00:31:17.767 --> 00:31:20.640
bet on which way the interest
rates are going to go.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.910
So what have we got now?
 

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:30.028
We've got this mortgage that's
sitting there.

00:31:30.028 --> 00:31:41.953
So let's say that you know that
the mortgage is owned by a very

00:31:41.953 --> 00:31:44.838
rational guy.
 

00:31:44.838 --> 00:31:49.027
The homeowner--he's not the
owner of the mortgage--the

00:31:49.027 --> 00:31:52.029
homeowners are very rational
people.

00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:54.490
The market is very foolish.
 

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:55.890
This is an exaggeration.
 

00:31:55.890 --> 00:32:01.680
The market might think the
homeowner never does anything,

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:05.608
so they think the bond is worth
120.

00:32:05.608 --> 00:32:10.140
You've studied prepayments much
more than the market does.

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.210
You realize that the homeowners
aren't going to just sit there,

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:16.380
dumbly paying whatever they owe
if the interest rates go down.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:21.246
They're going to prepay,
so in fact the mortgage is only

00:32:21.246 --> 00:32:22.220
worth 98.
 

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:25.058
So the market thinks it's worth
100.

00:32:25.058 --> 00:32:28.209
The market understands the
interest rate probabilities and

00:32:28.209 --> 00:32:30.420
is willing to give interest rate
risk.

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.240
They agree with you about that.
 

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.759
You don't know anything more
about interest rates than the

00:32:34.759 --> 00:32:35.380
market does.
 

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:39.451
What you do know is you know
something about the prepayments

00:32:39.451 --> 00:32:43.315
that the market doesn't know,
and so you know the bond is

00:32:43.315 --> 00:32:45.730
really worth 98 instead of 120.
 

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.950
So what should you do?
 

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:55.568
Let's suppose that the market
is actually treating--

00:32:55.568 --> 00:33:14.784
so what the market thinks,
mortgage is = to a 30 year

00:33:14.784 --> 00:33:19.307
bond--
well, it's not actually a bond

00:33:19.307 --> 00:33:21.868
because it doesn't have a
principal at the end,

00:33:21.868 --> 00:33:24.500
so I'm going to have to do a
different sheet here to get it

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.000
together.
 

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:32.348
The market thinks mortgage
never prepays.

00:33:32.348 --> 00:33:36.480
Let's suppose that what you can
trade in the market is these

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.440
interest rate derivatives.
 

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:46.410
So what should you do now?
 

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:49.085
You can trade the mortgage,
you can buy it,

00:33:49.085 --> 00:33:52.078
you can sell it short,
you can buy or sell these

00:33:52.078 --> 00:33:53.990
interest rate derivatives.
 

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:59.808
What would you do?
 

00:33:59.808 --> 00:34:02.970
Let's say you can only buy or
sell 1 unit of the mortgage.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:07.073
There's only 1 mortgage that is
trading, and since you know

00:34:07.073 --> 00:34:11.460
there's a mistake being made,
you're going to use all of it.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:16.768
So what would you do?
 

00:34:16.768 --> 00:34:19.949
Do you think the mortgage is
overvalued or undervalued?

00:34:19.949 --> 00:34:20.730
Student: Overvalued.
 

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:22.733
Prof: It's overvalued,
so therefore what should you

00:34:22.733 --> 00:34:22.909
do?
 

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:23.780
Student: Sell it.
 

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:26.039
Prof: Sell all you're
allowed to sell.

00:34:26.039 --> 00:34:28.518
I've assumed a little
artificially.

00:34:28.518 --> 00:34:30.889
All you can do is sell 1 unit
of the mortgage short.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:36.369
So you're going to sell it for
120 dollars.

00:34:36.369 --> 00:34:39.449
But what does it mean to sell
it short?

00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:42.773
It means you have to make the
payments that the mortgage is

00:34:42.773 --> 00:34:43.289
making.
 

00:34:43.289 --> 00:34:47.389
So you know those payments are
only worth 98 dollars?

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:48.539
So what does that mean?
 

00:34:48.539 --> 00:34:52.163
It means that you know you're
going to get a profit of 22

00:34:52.163 --> 00:34:52.809
dollars.
 

00:34:52.809 --> 00:34:56.690
However, you could get
completely crushed if things

00:34:56.690 --> 00:35:01.501
don't turn out exactly the way
you thought, so you want to lock

00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:04.139
in a constant profit for sure.
 

00:35:04.139 --> 00:35:06.862
So you don't want to get a huge
profit more than 20 and no

00:35:06.862 --> 00:35:09.635
profit in some other cases,
or even a negative profit and a

00:35:09.635 --> 00:35:10.400
huge profit.
 

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.869
You want your 22 dollars for
sure.

00:35:12.869 --> 00:35:14.480
So how would you do that?
 

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.250
What would you do?
 

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:18.880
Yes.
 

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:25.309
Student:
&gt;

00:35:25.309 --> 00:35:28.099
Prof: Okay,
so let's be more precise.

00:35:28.099 --> 00:35:31.010
It's exactly right,
but let's just see what this

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.940
really means.
 

00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:38.081
So I'm going to copy these
numbers down which I can't see

00:35:38.081 --> 00:35:38.739
yet.
 

00:35:38.739 --> 00:35:43.969
You have a mortgage that's 98.
 

00:35:43.969 --> 00:35:54.969
You know it's 98 something,
.8 and it could go in the up

00:35:54.969 --> 00:36:06.570
state to 92.6 or in the down
state it could go to 99.11.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:13.416
Now on the other hand,
the market thinks that this

00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:22.217
mortgage, this other instrument,
you're selling at the same time

00:36:22.217 --> 00:36:26.550
something that's worth 120.
 

00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.909
You're selling it for 120.
 

00:36:27.909 --> 00:36:32.429
It doesn't matter what the
mistake is the market makes.

00:36:32.429 --> 00:36:34.780
That's the reason why the
market made its mistake.

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.800
You don't care why they made
their mistake.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.460
You know they're just willing
to give you 120 for it.

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:42.639
So you're making a 22 dollar
profit, so what should you do?

00:36:42.639 --> 00:37:01.619
 
 

00:37:01.619 --> 00:37:04.880
If you were marking yourself to
market, what would you do?

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:11.650
What would you mark yourself to
market here?

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:14.652
Well, you've gotten 122 dollars
so you've marked yourself to

00:37:14.652 --> 00:37:15.110
market.
 

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:20.268
Here you'd say you're 21.16
dollars up.

00:37:20.268 --> 00:37:24.860
Here you'd have to say you're
not up so much money anymore,

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:29.530
because you've just lost some
of the value of your mortgage,

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:31.429
you've lost 6 bucks.
 

00:37:31.429 --> 00:37:34.750
So you'd have to say you're
only up 15 dollars now.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:39.682
And here you'd have to say you
made a little bit of money,

00:37:39.682 --> 00:37:42.280
so you're up 22 dollars now.
 

00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:48.739
But you want to lock in this
profit, 21.16 for sure.

00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:49.980
So what should you do?
 

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:55.530
If you're marking yourself to
market, you want to turn this

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:59.360
money into 21.16,
but more than 21.16.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:05.250
You want to turn this into
21.16 times (1 r_0).

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:11.699
You want to turn this into
21.16 times (1 r_0).

00:38:11.699 --> 00:38:14.807
Because then,
having locked in 21.16 times (1

00:38:14.807 --> 00:38:17.838
r_0),
that's no risk and it's got the

00:38:17.838 --> 00:38:20.619
same present value as this and
so every period,

00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:24.409
you want to keep locking your
money into 21.16.

00:38:24.409 --> 00:38:26.510
That's the gap between that and
up there.

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:29.369
Maybe 16 wasn't the right
number, by the way.

00:38:29.369 --> 00:38:31.780
What was this price up here
that they were willing to pay?

00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.460
They were willing to pay 120.58.
 

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.320
So that's a little bit more.
 

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:42.679
21.7 or something.
 

00:38:42.679 --> 00:38:46.119
So it's 21.7, that was the gap.
 

00:38:46.119 --> 00:38:52.230
So it's 120.58,
so the gap here is 21.7.

00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:59.030
So you want to turn this into
21.7 and this into 21.7.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.628
So 21.7 here,
you want to ensure that that's

00:39:01.628 --> 00:39:04.289
where you're marking yourself to
position.

00:39:04.289 --> 00:39:07.282
You want to know by the end of
the next year,

00:39:07.282 --> 00:39:11.297
you could turn this into 21.7
discounted up and then keep it

00:39:11.297 --> 00:39:13.610
discounting till the very end.
 

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:17.396
So whether you take your money
now, you take your money later,

00:39:17.396 --> 00:39:21.309
it's always a sure thing with
exactly the same present value.

00:39:21.309 --> 00:39:25.175
So how would you turn 21.7,
knowing that you're going to

00:39:25.175 --> 00:39:28.692
run this risk if you're marking
yourself to market,

00:39:28.692 --> 00:39:30.518
how would you do that?
 

00:39:30.518 --> 00:39:34.894
Well, you know the value of
this this at this interest rate,

00:39:34.894 --> 00:39:38.900
in the mortgage derivative
market, it's worth 98.84.

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:46.110
So you can always transform
this into exactly 91.84.

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:51.597
By doing a fair bet you can get
this to go up to 91.84 and this

00:39:51.597 --> 00:39:56.289
to go down to 91.--oh,
there's also a payment here.

00:39:56.289 --> 00:39:57.469
Don't forget the payment.
 

00:39:57.469 --> 00:39:59.300
So sorry, we've forgotten a
payment.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:05.025
The mortgage is much subtler
because you've actually gotten 8

00:40:05.025 --> 00:40:08.079
dollars here 8,
and this is 8.

00:40:08.079 --> 00:40:09.059
So we forgot about this.
 

00:40:09.059 --> 00:40:13.980
So you got an 8 dollar coupon
what was left was 92.6.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.170
this is 99.1 8.
 

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.358
So actually,
the total value here is 100.6

00:40:20.358 --> 00:40:24.139
and the total value here is
107.11.

00:40:24.139 --> 00:40:30.382
You discount this by this 6
percent interest and you get

00:40:30.382 --> 00:40:31.289
98.84.
 

00:40:31.289 --> 00:40:33.150
So I left out a crucial step.
 

00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:36.561
Remember, the cash flows here
are the coupon the value of the

00:40:36.561 --> 00:40:37.869
mortgage that's left.
 

00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:42.161
So the value of the mortgage
that's left is 92.65,

00:40:42.161 --> 00:40:44.090
the 8 dollar coupon.
 

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:46.492
So over here,
you're going to have a value of

00:40:46.492 --> 00:40:46.929
100.6.
 

00:40:46.929 --> 00:40:50.670
Down here, you're going to have
a value of 107.11.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:58.106
So how can you--you want that
to equal, locked in forever--so

00:40:58.106 --> 00:41:05.170
you've just sold this mortgage
for 120, so you've got 21.7

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:08.268
dollars sitting here.
 

00:41:08.268 --> 00:41:11.320
So now what can you do with
this 21.7 dollars?

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:15.577
You can cancel your cash flows
so what you owe on the mortgage

00:41:15.577 --> 00:41:18.510
is always exactly the same
thing, 98.84.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:23.202
So you want to make this 98.84,
so you have to subtract

00:41:23.202 --> 00:41:26.070
something off from here,
100.6.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:31.050
You want this to be equal
to--let's do it this way.

00:41:31.050 --> 00:41:37.581
Let's make this 98.--this is a
simpler way of saying it,

00:41:37.581 --> 00:41:39.599
I think--98.84.
 

00:41:39.599 --> 00:41:44.228
Let's turn this thing,
the present value of this and

00:41:44.228 --> 00:41:45.679
this is 98.84.
 

00:41:45.679 --> 00:41:48.938
Therefore you know there must
be some fair trade in the

00:41:48.938 --> 00:41:52.498
derivatives market that turns
this thing and this thing into

00:41:52.498 --> 00:41:56.382
98.84 times (1 r_0),
and this into the same thing,

00:41:56.382 --> 00:41:58.280
98.84 times (1 r_0).
 

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.690
How do you know you can do this?
 

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:03.619
Because the present value of
98.84 times (1 r_0)

00:42:03.619 --> 00:42:06.170
and 98.84 times (1
r_0),

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:11.146
1 half of that 1 half of that,
divided by (1 r_0) is

00:42:11.146 --> 00:42:11.800
98.84.
 

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:15.210
So therefore the present value
of this thing has to be the same

00:42:15.210 --> 00:42:17.300
as the present value of that
thing,

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.844
and therefore there must be
some trade in the derivatives

00:42:19.844 --> 00:42:22.416
market you can make,
where you sell some of these

00:42:22.416 --> 00:42:25.634
interest rate derivatives and
you buy some of these interest

00:42:25.634 --> 00:42:29.213
rate derivatives,
which guarantees you 98.84 in

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:30.219
both cases.
 

00:42:30.219 --> 00:42:33.047
So that means the present value
of what you have to deliver in

00:42:33.047 --> 00:42:35.166
cash--
the value of what you'd have to

00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:39.331
deliver in cash--
is 98.84, still 21.7 dollars,

00:42:39.331 --> 00:42:44.230
in present value terms,
less than what you've received.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:46.880
What have you done with this
120 dollars?

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.902
You've invested that at the
same interest rate and so now

00:42:49.902 --> 00:42:51.090
you've got a profit.
 

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:54.762
You owe 98.84,
jacked up by the interest rate,

00:42:54.762 --> 00:42:57.210
but the 120 you've invested.
 

00:42:57.210 --> 00:42:59.820
You've got that 120 the
interest rate.

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.076
You've always got more that
you're carrying on than the

00:43:02.076 --> 00:43:04.541
present value of what you owe,
and you keep going to the end

00:43:04.541 --> 00:43:05.210
of the tree.
 

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:07.902
When it ends,
you're still going to owe

00:43:07.902 --> 00:43:10.346
98.84,
increased by the interest rate

00:43:10.346 --> 00:43:13.115
a bunch of times,
but then the value of the money

00:43:13.115 --> 00:43:16.106
you have is going to be 120
increased by the same interest

00:43:16.106 --> 00:43:19.195
rate,
and so you're going to end up

00:43:19.195 --> 00:43:21.090
with money for sure.
 

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:25.233
So then you can just reverse it
all, and get the money 21.7

00:43:25.233 --> 00:43:29.235
locked in for sure at the
beginning and owe nothing later

00:43:29.235 --> 00:43:30.380
in the tree.
 

00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:35.923
So to say it all one more time,
you have to think of yourself

00:43:35.923 --> 00:43:38.050
as marking to market.
 

00:43:38.050 --> 00:43:41.648
If you're marking to market
correctly, you know what you owe

00:43:41.648 --> 00:43:45.186
is only worth 98 dollars and
what you've sold it for is 120

00:43:45.186 --> 00:43:45.920
dollars.
 

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.650
That's a profit of 21.7.
 

00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:52.119
But you want to make sure you
can maintain the same profit

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:54.572
forever,
or to put it another way,

00:43:54.572 --> 00:43:59.579
if you've bought this bond--
you want to make sure you can

00:43:59.579 --> 00:44:02.519
lock in your profit forever.
 

00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:04.329
So how would you do this?
 

00:44:04.329 --> 00:44:11.768
There are different ways of
doing it.

00:44:11.768 --> 00:44:14.530
Let's say you want this 21.7
dollars for sure at the

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:18.050
beginning and you don't want to
ever have to make any payments.

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:21.289
In the end you want everything
to cancel out.

00:44:21.289 --> 00:44:22.610
What would you do?
 

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:23.550
How would you do this?
 

00:44:23.550 --> 00:44:27.670
This number tells you,
you owe in present value terms

00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:28.940
98.84 dollars.
 

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.610
So you've gotten 120 dollars.
 

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:38.297
You could take the 120 dollars,
put 21.7 in your pocket,

00:44:38.297 --> 00:44:44.710
and now, with this 98 dollars,
you can buy these cash flows.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:45.869
What can you buy?
 

00:44:45.869 --> 00:44:51.775
You can invest money so that
you--you can buy the right

00:44:51.775 --> 00:44:57.789
interest rate derivatives so
you're able to make all the

00:44:57.789 --> 00:45:01.400
payments of the future bonds.
 

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.739
So this bond,
the actual payments the bond is

00:45:03.739 --> 00:45:06.079
going to make,
you can buy all those payments

00:45:06.079 --> 00:45:07.250
for 98.84 dollars.
 

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.530
I guess that's the simplest way
of saying it.

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:11.550
I'm going a little bit in
circles.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:15.001
What is the mortgage security
down here if you know how the

00:45:15.001 --> 00:45:16.610
mortgage is going to pay?
 

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:18.414
All this is,
is a bunch of payments at

00:45:18.414 --> 00:45:19.880
different parts in the tree.
 

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:23.789
It pays 8 dollars here it pays
8 dollars here.

00:45:23.789 --> 00:45:26.494
Somewhere low in the tree,
it's going to just prepay for

00:45:26.494 --> 00:45:28.610
sure and pay the whole remaining
balance.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:37.190
Down here, it's just paid off
for sure, so it's prepaid.

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:42.065
Sorry, it's prepaid at the
top--at the bottom,

00:45:42.065 --> 00:45:43.690
it's prepaid.
 

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.981
The fact that all these
payments together are worth

00:45:47.981 --> 00:45:52.960
98.84 means that by taking 98.84
dollars and trading on the

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.297
derivatives market,
you can buy all those payments

00:45:57.297 --> 00:45:58.739
for exactly 98.84.
 

00:45:58.739 --> 00:46:01.179
So therefore as you go farther
into the tree,

00:46:01.179 --> 00:46:03.619
you always will have the
payments to make.

00:46:03.619 --> 00:46:04.989
You've sold the bond short.
 

00:46:04.989 --> 00:46:05.820
What does that mean?
 

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:08.579
Any time this bond makes a
dividend payment,

00:46:08.579 --> 00:46:10.570
you have to make the payment.
 

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:14.139
But you can always buy those
payments for 98.84.

00:46:14.139 --> 00:46:17.369
How do you know you can buy
those payments for 98.84?

00:46:17.369 --> 00:46:21.449
Well, by backward induction.
 

00:46:21.449 --> 00:46:24.795
Here, the payments are 8
dollars here,

00:46:24.795 --> 00:46:27.869
92 dollars of remaining
dollars.

00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:32.476
So there's a way in the
interest rate derivatives market

00:46:32.476 --> 00:46:36.077
of buying 8 92.6,
that's 100.6 dollars here,

00:46:36.077 --> 00:46:39.010
and buying 107.11 dollars here.
 

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:43.690
So by spending this 98.84,
you can get,

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:46.190
buy this many interest
derivatives,

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:48.360
so you can get 100 dollars of
payments here,

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.719
and 107 dollars of payments
here.

00:46:50.719 --> 00:46:55.231
Half of 100 half of 107,
discounted at 6 percent

00:46:55.231 --> 00:46:57.920
interest, gives you 98.84.
 

00:46:57.920 --> 00:47:02.054
So it's possible on the market
to buy 100 dollars up here and

00:47:02.054 --> 00:47:04.809
107 dollars down here with this
98.84.

00:47:04.809 --> 00:47:07.952
Now out of those 100 dollars up
here you've bought,

00:47:07.952 --> 00:47:11.409
give 8 of them to the guy you
sold the bond short to.

00:47:11.409 --> 00:47:12.530
That's the coupon payment.
 

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:16.175
Down here, give 8 of these
dollars to the same guy you sold

00:47:16.175 --> 00:47:17.559
the coupon short to.
 

00:47:17.559 --> 00:47:22.278
Now that leaves you with 92
dollars up there and 99 dollars

00:47:22.278 --> 00:47:22.929
there.
 

00:47:22.929 --> 00:47:25.996
But this 92 dollars is the
present value of what's going to

00:47:25.996 --> 00:47:28.284
happen next,
and what's going to happen next

00:47:28.284 --> 00:47:31.175
up here is that you're going to
owe 8 dollars to the guy here

00:47:31.175 --> 00:47:33.780
and you're going to owe 8
dollars to the guy here,

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.219
but what's left will be worth
83 dollars and 97 dollars.

00:47:37.219 --> 00:47:44.240
So therefore with this 92
dollars, you in fact are able to

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:50.275
buy this 92 105 here,
because the present value of

00:47:50.275 --> 00:47:55.449
92, almost 92,105 here,
is exactly 92.

00:47:55.449 --> 00:47:56.699
That's how we got this number.
 

00:47:56.699 --> 00:48:00.248
It's 1 half times this number
the coupon, 1 half times this

00:48:00.248 --> 00:48:03.248
number the coupon,
discounted at the interest rate

00:48:03.248 --> 00:48:04.840
corresponding to here.
 

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.150
That is 92 dollars.
 

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:09.255
So therefore,
by investing here in the

00:48:09.255 --> 00:48:13.201
interest rate market,
you can buy that cash flow

00:48:13.201 --> 00:48:15.719
here, the 84 8,92 dollars.
 

00:48:15.719 --> 00:48:18.043
Pay the guy the 8,
you'll still have 83 dollars

00:48:18.043 --> 00:48:21.125
left and with the cash you have
over here, remember you bought

00:48:21.125 --> 00:48:22.489
exactly this much cash.
 

00:48:22.489 --> 00:48:24.329
You've got this much cash left.
 

00:48:24.329 --> 00:48:27.132
You can buy all the payments
you need to make here,

00:48:27.132 --> 00:48:30.159
the 8-dollar coupon,
plus you'll still have 97 left.

00:48:30.159 --> 00:48:33.818
So all the way forward through
the tree, you could always

00:48:33.818 --> 00:48:37.150
afford to buy all the cash
payments of this bond.

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:40.922
So you can pay off the guy you
sold it short to all the coupon

00:48:40.922 --> 00:48:44.510
payments that this bond is
making, by having invested 98.84

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:45.809
at the beginning.
 

00:48:45.809 --> 00:48:48.831
And similarly,
you got 120 by selling the bond

00:48:48.831 --> 00:48:52.523
short, so you've made 21.7
dollars and there's never any

00:48:52.523 --> 00:48:55.210
more cash coming out of your
pocket.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:59.110
You pocketed the 21.7 and you
invested the 98.84 in the

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:01.710
derivatives market over and
over,

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:05.610
changing your investment,
and therefore reproducing all

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:10.090
the cash flows that you have to
make to the guy for having sold

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:11.030
it short.
 

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:13.340
I didn't say it very well.
 

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.460
How followable was that?
 

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:16.980
Not very followable.
 

00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:18.989
Sorry, I didn't do a good job.
 

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.518
Let's try again.
 

00:49:20.518 --> 00:49:23.280
What is the essence of what's
going on?

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:26.836
The essence of what's going on
is that gain-by-gain or

00:49:26.836 --> 00:49:29.521
month-by-month,
you can find someone else

00:49:29.521 --> 00:49:32.610
who'll always trade at fair odds
with you.

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:35.260
Fair odds means--in the
interest market.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.161
They don't know,
these people trading the

00:49:37.161 --> 00:49:39.159
interest rate market,
they don't understand

00:49:39.159 --> 00:49:39.920
prepayments.
 

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.619
It's not like the bookie here.
 

00:49:41.619 --> 00:49:42.989
They don't understand
prepayments.

00:49:42.989 --> 00:49:45.710
They're not willing to be with
you on what prepayments are

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:46.380
going to be.
 

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:49.791
They're just going to bet with
you on what interest rate is

00:49:49.791 --> 00:49:50.909
going to turn up.
 

00:49:50.909 --> 00:49:53.762
But you see,
the cash flows from the bond

00:49:53.762 --> 00:49:58.039
depended on prepayments and
depended on the interest rate.

00:49:58.039 --> 00:50:02.512
So you calculated it was worth
98.84 because you know what

00:50:02.512 --> 00:50:05.260
prepayments to put in the
future.

00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.681
So if you're absolutely
confident on your prepayments,

00:50:08.681 --> 00:50:12.298
you're going to know what this
bond is going to do in the

00:50:12.298 --> 00:50:13.010
future.
 

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.110
So remember the prepayments.
 

00:50:15.110 --> 00:50:16.880
What are these prepayments?
 

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.699
It's this stuff.
 

00:50:18.699 --> 00:50:20.248
So down here,
where the 1s are,

00:50:20.248 --> 00:50:23.242
the guy's prepaid for sure,
so you'd have to deliver to the

00:50:23.242 --> 00:50:26.030
market the entire remaining
balance at that point.

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:29.650
But see, when you calculated
this bond,

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:32.110
you were anticipating what all
the payments were going to be,

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:34.331
whether they were going to be
the whole remaining balance or

00:50:34.331 --> 00:50:35.010
just the coupon.
 

00:50:35.010 --> 00:50:38.052
Taking the present value,
what calculations were you

00:50:38.052 --> 00:50:38.530
doing?
 

00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:42.099
In the present value,
you're doing calculations that

00:50:42.099 --> 00:50:43.360
this guy can do.
 

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.498
You're just taking 1 half times
this 1 half times that

00:50:46.498 --> 00:50:47.268
discounted.
 

00:50:47.268 --> 00:50:50.010
The interest rate derivative
guy is willing to do that.

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:52.099
He doesn't know what the
prepayments are going to be,

00:50:52.099 --> 00:50:54.150
but you're never betting on
prepayments with him.

00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:55.771
With the interest rate
derivatives guy,

00:50:55.771 --> 00:50:57.907
you're just saying,
"Let me pay you some money

00:50:57.907 --> 00:50:58.250
now.
 

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.289
You give me money if things go
up here,

00:51:00.289 --> 00:51:03.221
or I'll pay you some money now
and you give me money if things

00:51:03.221 --> 00:51:05.385
go down here,
if interest rates go up here or

00:51:05.385 --> 00:51:06.960
interest rates go down
here."

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:11.460
So because the present value of
the mortgage cash flows

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:16.211
evaluated according to the
interest rate probabilities and

00:51:16.211 --> 00:51:19.914
discounting is 98.84,
that means that you can

00:51:19.914 --> 00:51:23.181
successively trade on the
interest rate market and

00:51:23.181 --> 00:51:25.849
reproduce all the mortgage
payments,

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:28.539
assuming you're right about
what they're going to be.

00:51:28.539 --> 00:51:32.204
And therefore with 98.84
dollars, you can replicate what

00:51:32.204 --> 00:51:34.268
the mortgage is going to pay.
 

00:51:34.268 --> 00:51:35.989
And therefore,
you make 21.

00:51:35.989 --> 00:51:38.768
7 for free, because you sold it
for 120.

00:51:38.768 --> 00:51:42.780
You only need 98.84 of that to
reproduce all the payments of

00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:44.139
the mortgage bond.
 

00:51:44.139 --> 00:51:45.460
And how do you know that you
can do that?

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.000
Because it's just one step
repeated over and over again.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.880
At every step,
there's going to be a payment

00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:54.500
of say 8 dollars and a present
value of what's left.

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.302
And there'll be a payment down
here of 8 dollars and a present

00:51:57.302 --> 00:51:58.360
value of what's left.
 

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:04.295
Or maybe this thing is just a
prepayment, in which case it's a

00:52:04.295 --> 00:52:06.730
single payment of 99.5.
 

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:09.219
That's the remaining balance
after 1 period.

00:52:09.219 --> 00:52:12.847
But when you figure out this
number, it's always taken by

00:52:12.847 --> 00:52:16.929
averaging this number discounted
with this number discounted.

00:52:16.929 --> 00:52:20.496
So therefore,
averaging at the odds the

00:52:20.496 --> 00:52:23.690
interest rate guy will give you.
 

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:25.094
So therefore,
using this money,

00:52:25.094 --> 00:52:27.530
we're now doing the opposite of
the World Series,

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:31.989
using this money,
you can buy this total payment,

00:52:31.989 --> 00:52:33.630
and you can buy this total
payment,

00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:36.409
because that's exactly what the
interest rate guy will give you.

00:52:36.409 --> 00:52:40.663
This is equal to 1 half of all
that divided by 1 r_0,

00:52:40.663 --> 00:52:44.300
plus 1 half of all this divided
by 1 r_0.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.648
That is this number,
so therefore in the interest

00:52:46.648 --> 00:52:49.583
rate market, by using this cash,
you can buy that and you can

00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:50.219
buy that.
 

00:52:50.219 --> 00:52:53.806
And that's enough to make the
payment A8 that the mortgage is

00:52:53.806 --> 00:52:55.719
paying, you keep your promise.
 

00:52:55.719 --> 00:52:58.137
And over here,
if the mortgage prepaid,

00:52:58.137 --> 00:53:00.746
the remaining balance,
that's that number,

00:53:00.746 --> 00:53:02.719
99.5, you can pay that too.
 

00:53:02.719 --> 00:53:04.630
And then the mortgage is done.
 

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:07.163
Here the mortgage is going to
go on, but see,

00:53:07.163 --> 00:53:10.559
it's going on at present value
you've calculated at 92.6.

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:13.460
You bought 92.6 8.
 

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.219
You use the 8 to pay off the
coupon.

00:53:15.219 --> 00:53:18.820
You still have 92.6 dollars in
your pocket here.

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:21.702
You're going to use that to buy
the future payments of the

00:53:21.702 --> 00:53:24.016
mortgage,
some of which will be a coupon,

00:53:24.016 --> 00:53:26.219
and maybe this will be another
coupon,

00:53:26.219 --> 00:53:28.619
plus the present value of
what's left.

00:53:28.619 --> 00:53:30.766
If it goes down here again,
the guy might prepay,

00:53:30.766 --> 00:53:33.630
but you're going to have enough
money to make that prepayment.

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.735
So with this 98.84 dollars,
you're just doing fair odds

00:53:36.735 --> 00:53:38.000
over and over again.
 

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.226
You're buying the future cash
flows of the mortgage and

00:53:41.226 --> 00:53:44.697
therefore with 98.84 dollars,
you can keep all your promises,

00:53:44.697 --> 00:53:46.960
and yet you've gotten 120 at
the beginning,

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.019
so you've locked it in.
 

00:53:49.019 --> 00:53:53.079
That's it.
 

00:53:53.079 --> 00:53:53.880
Any questions?
 

00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:56.603
I don't know if that was too
clear, so somebody ask a

00:53:56.603 --> 00:53:57.179
question.
 

00:53:57.179 --> 00:54:00.530
You're great at asking
questions.

00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:01.820
Is this followable?
 

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:02.929
Student:
&gt;

00:54:02.929 --> 00:54:06.530
Prof: Okay,
that's too good.

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:09.199
Too great.
 

00:54:09.199 --> 00:54:21.900
Okay, let's see if I can do
another example.

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:25.969
Let's suppose that we've got
this bond.

00:54:25.969 --> 00:54:32.179
Let's say you can't trade in
the interest rate derivatives

00:54:32.179 --> 00:54:37.081
market directly,
but you can trade in the bond

00:54:37.081 --> 00:54:38.280
market.
 

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:40.170
So let's get more realistic now.
 

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:46.429
Let's suppose that there's a
bond market.

00:54:46.429 --> 00:54:53.373
Now here we had interest
rates--so it was a 30-year bond,

00:54:53.373 --> 00:55:01.059
the starting interest rate was
6, and the volatility was 20.

00:55:01.059 --> 00:55:05.514
So we had that sheet that was
bond market trading,

00:55:05.514 --> 00:55:07.969
so let's just go to that.
 

00:55:07.969 --> 00:55:12.449
File, where's open.
 

00:55:12.449 --> 00:55:16.829
So callable bond.
 

00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:18.380
Here we are in the bond market.
 

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:21.827
Let's say there's a 9 percent
coupon bond, doesn't matter what

00:55:21.827 --> 00:55:22.280
it is.
 

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:26.860
We start at the interest rate
of .06.

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.590
Was that where we were starting?
 

00:55:28.590 --> 00:55:32.960
And the volatility was 20.
 

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.806
So here we have the same
exact--exactly the same interest

00:55:37.806 --> 00:55:41.963
rate process as before,
so those are the interest

00:55:41.963 --> 00:55:44.820
rates, just as we had before.
 

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:47.409
Now let's talk about a bond.
 

00:55:47.409 --> 00:55:49.019
So it's a non-callable bond.
 

00:55:49.019 --> 00:55:50.860
I forgot already what I said.
 

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.730
How long was this bond?
 

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:56.340
It was a 30-year bond.
 

00:55:56.340 --> 00:56:03.360
Didn't have to be 30 years,
but anyway, it's a 30-year,

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:08.949
9 percent bond,
and its value was 140.93.

00:56:08.949 --> 00:56:12.420
So the bond is worth 140.93.
 

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:23.407
If the interest rates go up,
same interest rate process,

00:56:23.407 --> 00:56:30.000
it can go to 121.4 or to 159.4.
 

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:37.280
So now let's suppose you can't
trade in the interest rate

00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:39.619
market any more.
 

00:56:39.619 --> 00:56:48.190
What should you do now?
 

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:49.800
Student:
Don't you need another bond?

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:51.010
Prof: Well,
you've got the interest rate.

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:53.195
You've got the 1-month
[correction: year]

00:56:53.195 --> 00:56:56.420
bond that you can trade at an
interest rate of 6 percent and

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:58.170
you've got this bond market.
 

00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:02.010
So anyone will buy and sell
with you.

00:57:02.010 --> 00:57:09.170
Remember, this is the 30-year,
9 percent coupon bond.

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:12.969
They're all willing to buy and
sell this with you.

00:57:12.969 --> 00:57:16.576
And you've got this mortgage
that everybody else thinks is

00:57:16.576 --> 00:57:19.675
the price is worth 120,
but you're sure it's worth

00:57:19.675 --> 00:57:22.460
98.84, because you know the
prepayments.

00:57:22.460 --> 00:57:25.275
The homeowners are smart and
they're going to prepay and

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:27.630
nobody else realizes they're
going to do it.

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.170
So what should you do now?
 

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:32.389
You can't trade interest rate
derivatives any more.

00:57:32.389 --> 00:57:37.958
All you can do is trade in the
bond market, so do you have any

00:57:37.958 --> 00:57:40.239
idea what you could do?
 

00:57:40.239 --> 00:57:41.518
What would you do?
 

00:57:41.518 --> 00:57:45.280
This is even slightly more
realistic example.

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:50.469
You've got a mortgage that you
know is overvalued.

00:57:50.469 --> 00:57:53.838
You've got a bond that you can
trade, and of course you can

00:57:53.838 --> 00:57:56.161
trade a very short bond,
the 1-year bond,

00:57:56.161 --> 00:57:58.659
which is trading at 6 percent
interest.

00:57:58.659 --> 00:58:01.980
You can trade a 1 year
treasury, and here's the 30

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:05.708
year, 9 percent treasury,
which happens to be worth 140,

00:58:05.708 --> 00:58:07.469
so what should you do?
 

00:58:07.469 --> 00:58:10.730
Well, you know that you could
sell this mortgage short,

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:14.215
get 120 dollars for it,
and you think the value of the

00:58:14.215 --> 00:58:16.940
payments is only 98,
so you'd love to do this.

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:22.679
The trouble is,
the future values depend on a

00:58:22.679 --> 00:58:25.420
lot of uncertainty.
 

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:31.505
It may be that the payments you
might have to make are more than

00:58:31.505 --> 00:58:34.789
98, so what are you going to do?
 

00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:41.349
How would you lock in your
profit for sure?

00:58:41.349 --> 00:58:43.829
Can anybody figure out what to
do, just intuitively?

00:58:43.829 --> 00:58:50.369
It seems pretty complicated to
figure out what to do.

00:58:50.369 --> 00:58:53.070
So you sell this bond for 120.
 

00:58:53.070 --> 00:58:55.889
You put the 21.7 dollars in
your pocket.

00:58:55.889 --> 00:58:59.806
You have 98.4 dollars now that
you have to spend to somehow

00:58:59.806 --> 00:59:03.860
acquire payments that are going
to just allow you to make the

00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.815
bond payments you've sold short,
the mortgage payments you've

00:59:07.815 --> 00:59:10.556
sold short at every node,
so you never have to give up

00:59:10.556 --> 00:59:11.320
any more money.
 

00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:14.610
So what should you do?
 

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:19.264
You want to acquire some assets
with this 98.84 dollars that

00:59:19.264 --> 00:59:24.155
will put you in a position where
you have 100.6 dollars up here

00:59:24.155 --> 00:59:26.760
and 107.1 dollars down there.
 

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.219
So how can you do that?
 

00:59:30.219 --> 00:59:35.797
Well, you have a combination of
the short--you have this 30-year

00:59:35.797 --> 00:59:38.190
bond you could invest in.
 

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:41.757
If you spent 98 dollars on the
30 year bond,

00:59:41.757 --> 00:59:46.237
that's 70 percent of that,
so that would give you 84 up

00:59:46.237 --> 00:59:48.559
here and 105 down there.
 

00:59:48.559 --> 00:59:51.130
So it wouldn't match what you
really need.

00:59:51.130 --> 00:59:55.347
On the other hand,
you could put your 98 dollars

00:59:55.347 --> 00:59:59.387
in the 1-year bond,
which would give you 98.84

00:59:59.387 --> 01:00:02.619
times 1.06 and 98.84 times 1.06.
 

01:00:02.619 --> 01:00:08.956
So you've got this choice,
or you can put 100 dollars here

01:00:08.956 --> 01:00:12.070
and get 106 dollars there.
 

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:16.474
The interest rate we said was 6
percent, so that means there's a

01:00:16.474 --> 01:00:19.760
1-year bond that pays 106 in
these two cases.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:25.916
There's the 30-year bond,
where 140 dollars could be

01:00:25.916 --> 01:00:29.539
worth this in the two cases.
 

01:00:29.539 --> 01:00:32.262
So let's say you can't go trade
on the derivatives market,

01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:33.170
it doesn't exist.
 

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:35.730
Or at least you don't know how
to trade on it.

01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:38.858
But what you do know how to
trade is on the bond market,

01:00:38.858 --> 01:00:41.929
and--the long bond market and
the short bond market.

01:00:41.929 --> 01:00:54.195
So let's call this the long
bond market, and the short bond

01:00:54.195 --> 01:00:56.099
market.
 

01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:57.059
So what would you do?
 

01:00:57.059 --> 01:01:16.260
 
 

01:01:16.260 --> 01:01:18.969
Any thoughts here?
 

01:01:18.969 --> 01:01:20.920
Let me repeat the problem.
 

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.123
You find, like you typically do
when you're a trader,

01:01:23.123 --> 01:01:24.860
you know something other guys
don't do.

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.429
That's what you're making your
whole livelihood on.

01:01:26.429 --> 01:01:30.320
You understand that prepayments
are going to be very fast.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.880
The people know how to prepay.
 

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.952
The rest of the market,
hasn't occurred to them yet

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:35.989
that people can prepay.
 

01:01:35.989 --> 01:01:39.416
They're grossly overpaying for
the mortgage,

01:01:39.416 --> 01:01:41.090
paying 120 dollars.
 

01:01:41.090 --> 01:01:43.059
So you go and sell the mortgage
short.

01:01:43.059 --> 01:01:46.436
Now that means you have to
deliver what the mortgage is

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:47.000
paying.
 

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.701
You have to deliver it to other
people, so that's a lot to take

01:01:50.701 --> 01:01:51.000
on.
 

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.869
But I say that you can sell
this bond for 120,

01:01:55.869 --> 01:01:59.226
put 21.7 in your pocket,
take the remaining 98.84

01:01:59.226 --> 01:02:03.351
dollars and now buy the cash
flows that you're going to have

01:02:03.351 --> 01:02:05.380
to deliver in the future.
 

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:07.179
How do you know you can buy all
the cash flows?

01:02:07.179 --> 01:02:09.030
There are 30 years of cash
flows.

01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:11.030
There are coupon payments,
there are prepayments.

01:02:11.030 --> 01:02:14.068
There are all kinds of
complicated payments of the cash

01:02:14.068 --> 01:02:14.518
flows.
 

01:02:14.518 --> 01:02:17.594
How, with this 98.84 dollars,
are you going to be able to buy

01:02:17.594 --> 01:02:18.570
them all exactly?
 

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.900
All you can do is trade,
buy the long bond and buy the

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:25.420
short bond, or maybe sell the
long bond short or sell the

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.739
short bond short.
 

01:02:26.739 --> 01:02:31.523
So how, by trading these two
securities over and over again,

01:02:31.523 --> 01:02:35.659
can you replicate the cash
flows of the mortgage?

01:02:35.659 --> 01:02:38.619
That way you will have hedged
out your risk,

01:02:38.619 --> 01:02:42.048
and you'll have the 21.7 locked
in without ever having to worry

01:02:42.048 --> 01:02:45.902
about anything in the future,
provided your prepayment

01:02:45.902 --> 01:02:48.159
calculations are correct.
 

01:02:48.159 --> 01:02:50.539
If you're wrong about
prepayments, then you're going

01:02:50.539 --> 01:02:52.826
to be in big trouble,
so you're betting on knowing

01:02:52.826 --> 01:02:54.179
what the prepayments are.
 

01:02:54.179 --> 01:02:55.590
So what should you do?
 

01:02:55.590 --> 01:03:00.838
Well, here this thing is going
to--the cash flows at this point

01:03:00.838 --> 01:03:03.380
are going to be worth 100.6.
 

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.730
The 8 that you have to deliver,
92.6 for the present value of

01:03:06.730 --> 01:03:08.070
the future cash flows.
 

01:03:08.070 --> 01:03:14.130
Here they're worth--let's just
do the real thing.

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:18.750
Never mind that stuff--here
they're worth 107.11.

01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:26.960
Now you know that 1 half times
1 over (1 r_0) of 106

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:32.480
1 half over (1 .06) times 107 is
98.84.

01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.510
So the average of these
discounted is that number.

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:41.715
You know that the average of
these numbers--so this is the

01:03:41.715 --> 01:03:46.010
non-callable bond,
so it's not these numbers.

01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:49.760
It's this number 9 and this
number 9.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:55.576
It's paid a coupon,
so the average of these

01:03:55.576 --> 01:04:01.670
numbers, discounted by 6
percent, is that.

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:10.679
So what does that tell you you
should do?

01:04:10.679 --> 01:04:14.262
I claim by combining this bond
and this bond,

01:04:14.262 --> 01:04:17.518
you can produce 100.6 and
107.11 here.

01:04:17.518 --> 01:04:25.827
So we know that this top bond
is going to pay you 130.4 up

01:04:25.827 --> 01:04:29.909
there and 168.4 down here.
 

01:04:29.909 --> 01:04:34.235
If you bought X units of the
long bond, that's what your

01:04:34.235 --> 01:04:35.730
payoffs would be.
 

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:39.059
The short bond is going to pay
you 106 in both cases.

01:04:39.059 --> 01:04:42.583
So if you bought X units of the
short bond, that's what your

01:04:42.583 --> 01:04:43.659
payoff would be.
 

01:04:43.659 --> 01:04:59.599
You want the payoff to be 100.6
and 107.11.

01:04:59.599 --> 01:05:01.635
So there must be an
X_L and an

01:05:01.635 --> 01:05:03.360
X_S that equals that.
 

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.639
How do you know there has to be?
 

01:05:04.639 --> 01:05:08.018
Because it's 2 equations and 2
unknowns and these are

01:05:08.018 --> 01:05:09.579
independent equations.
 

01:05:09.579 --> 01:05:12.018
In fact, you can tell what
X_L has to be.

01:05:12.018 --> 01:05:19.315
This gap between 100.6 and 107,
that gap is about 7,

01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:23.179
and this gap is about 38.
 

01:05:23.179 --> 01:05:28.744
So 7 is like 1 fifth of 38,
so X_L is going to

01:05:28.744 --> 01:05:30.869
have to be 1 fifth.
 

01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:35.938
I know in advance that this is
going to turn out to be about 7

01:05:35.938 --> 01:05:36.768
over 38.
 

01:05:36.768 --> 01:05:40.728
Just by general principles,
you know there's a solution for

01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:43.050
X_L and X_S.
 

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:46.041
So I know there's a solution to
that because it's 2 linear

01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:48.929
equations and 2 unknowns and
they're not degenerate,

01:05:48.929 --> 01:05:51.449
so I know there has to be a
solution to that.

01:05:51.449 --> 01:05:53.789
And I also can tell you what
X_L has to be,

01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:55.815
because the gap,
that's the difference between

01:05:55.815 --> 01:05:57.929
the top number and the bottom
number, is 7.

01:05:57.929 --> 01:06:00.329
That gap over there is 38.
 

01:06:00.329 --> 01:06:03.989
So obviously the middle gap,
106 and 106 is 0.

01:06:03.989 --> 01:06:07.255
So if I take X_L to
be 7 thirty-eighths of that

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:10.230
number, the gap is going to go
down from 38 to 7.

01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:13.681
Then I'll just have to find the
right X_S to make that

01:06:13.681 --> 01:06:14.119
equal.
 

01:06:14.119 --> 01:06:18.349
So that combination of
X_L and X_S

01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:22.659
will produce this payoff here
and this payoff there.

01:06:22.659 --> 01:06:26.320
So I know what combination of
the long bond and the short bond

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.960
to hold so I produce exactly
these things.

01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:33.286
So I'm going to get a cash flow
of 100.6 and 107.11 and I'll be

01:06:33.286 --> 01:06:37.126
able to use that to make the
coupon payment of 8 in both

01:06:37.126 --> 01:06:41.297
cases and on top of that,
have enough money to continue

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.159
buying future cash flows.
 

01:06:43.159 --> 01:06:48.389
Now what will the cost of the
X_L and X short be?

01:06:48.389 --> 01:06:53.237
It will be X_L--I'll
have to pay 100 dollars for the

01:06:53.237 --> 01:06:55.603
short bond,
if I have to do X_S,

01:06:55.603 --> 01:06:57.755
X_short,
and I'll have to take 7

01:06:57.755 --> 01:07:00.829
thirty-eighths of 140,
that's how much it'll cost me

01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:02.119
to buy the long bond.
 

01:07:02.119 --> 01:07:06.619
So the right combination of
short bond and long bond will

01:07:06.619 --> 01:07:08.869
give me the right payoffs.
 

01:07:08.869 --> 01:07:13.996
And it's clear that there is an
X_S here and an

01:07:13.996 --> 01:07:18.391
X_L here,
such that I get the payoffs I

01:07:18.391 --> 01:07:20.590
want of 100 and 107.
 

01:07:20.590 --> 01:07:23.947
But the last thing to notice is
the cost of this X_L

01:07:23.947 --> 01:07:27.722
and this X_S,
which is going to be 140 times

01:07:27.722 --> 01:07:30.769
X_L 100 times
X_S.

01:07:30.769 --> 01:07:38.119
That cost will be exactly 98.84.
 

01:07:38.119 --> 01:07:42.909
How do I know that--therefore
I'll just be able to do it.

01:07:42.909 --> 01:07:45.480
I'll ask you that question in a
second.

01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:48.760
Here's what this hedging
amounts to.

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.588
The hedging amounts to again,
you know because of your

01:07:51.588 --> 01:07:54.255
superior knowledge of
prepayments that the mortgage

01:07:54.255 --> 01:07:56.525
cash flows,
not the mortgage itself,

01:07:56.525 --> 01:07:59.947
the cash flows that are going
to come from the mortgage are

01:07:59.947 --> 01:08:01.070
only worth 98.8.
 

01:08:01.070 --> 01:08:04.594
Someone's handing you 120
dollars in exchange for making

01:08:04.594 --> 01:08:06.389
those mortgage cash flows.
 

01:08:06.389 --> 01:08:08.090
Okay, so what do you do for
that?

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:11.480
You take the 98.84 dollars out
of the 120.

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.659
You take 21.7.
 

01:08:12.659 --> 01:08:13.880
That goes into your pocket.
 

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:18.020
The 98.4 you have to use to buy
the future cash flows.

01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:20.229
The first cash flows are going
to be 8 dollars,

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.158
but you're going to need more
money to buy the cash flows that

01:08:23.158 --> 01:08:23.880
come after.
 

01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:25.319
How much more money do you need?
 

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:28.720
92.6 here, 99.1 there.
 

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.680
So how can you put yourself in
a position to have 100.6 dollars

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.158
here and 107.11 dollars here?
 

01:08:36.158 --> 01:08:41.274
Can you use this amount of
money to buy this value at the

01:08:41.274 --> 01:08:42.368
next step?
 

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:44.960
We saw in the derivatives
market, yes you can.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.538
But even if you can't trade in
the derivatives market,

01:08:47.538 --> 01:08:50.411
you don't need to if you could
trade a short bond and a long

01:08:50.411 --> 01:08:50.850
bond.
 

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:54.733
You would just find how much of
the long bond do I hold and how

01:08:54.733 --> 01:08:58.239
much of the short bond do I
hold, so I can get these cash

01:08:58.239 --> 01:09:00.118
flows of 100.6 and 107.11?
 

01:09:00.118 --> 01:09:02.899
The answer is,
you have to solve that equation

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:03.578
up there.
 

01:09:03.578 --> 01:09:06.716
What X_L and what
X_S gives you that

01:09:06.716 --> 01:09:07.229
number?
 

01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:10.216
You know that there's some
X_L and some

01:09:10.216 --> 01:09:13.886
X_S that will solve
that, because it's 2 equations

01:09:13.886 --> 01:09:15.069
and 2 unknowns.
 

01:09:15.069 --> 01:09:15.970
I'm repeating myself.
 

01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:18.720
You even know what
X_L is without writing

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.077
down the equations,
because the gap has to be--one

01:09:22.077 --> 01:09:23.197
thing,
there's no risk,

01:09:23.197 --> 01:09:24.899
and the other thing,
there's a big risk.

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:29.380
So the only risk in the payoff
has to come from the long bond.

01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:31.935
So that gap of 38,
if you take 7 thirty-eighths of

01:09:31.935 --> 01:09:34.649
that, you're going to get the
gap to go down to 7.

01:09:34.649 --> 01:09:37.170
So the X_L's going to
turn out to be 7 thirty-eighths.

01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:39.939
X_S you have to solve
by algebra.

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:42.631
So you know how much that
X_L is and what the

01:09:42.631 --> 01:09:43.578
X_S is.
 

01:09:43.578 --> 01:09:45.791
That's what you hold,
that combination of

01:09:45.791 --> 01:09:48.943
X_L and X_S,
you hold here and you get

01:09:48.943 --> 01:09:50.270
exactly the payoffs.
 

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:54.298
And then the final step is to
notice that you can exactly

01:09:54.298 --> 01:09:56.529
afford it with 98.84 dollars.
 

01:09:56.529 --> 01:09:58.408
How do you know that you can
afford it?

01:09:58.408 --> 01:10:06.520
Because what you want is 100.6
and 107.11 and that costs 98.84.

01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:14.731
You're buying two things
together whose payoffs together

01:10:14.731 --> 01:10:17.420
are worth 98.84.
 

01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.797
So therefore the cost of the
two things separately have to be

01:10:21.797 --> 01:10:22.819
worth 98.84.
 

01:10:22.819 --> 01:10:25.597
So it will turn out when you
solve for X_L and

01:10:25.597 --> 01:10:27.569
X_S,
you'll exactly be able to

01:10:27.569 --> 01:10:29.538
afford it with this amount of
cash.

01:10:29.538 --> 01:10:33.393
So you can just do that going
forward all the time,

01:10:33.393 --> 01:10:36.399
constantly re-hedging your
portfolio.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:38.710
So that's the essence of
dynamic hedging.

01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:42.533
It's a very beautiful idea
which I probably haven't

01:10:42.533 --> 01:10:46.944
explained in the optimal way,
but the point is that,

01:10:46.944 --> 01:10:50.250
to summarize the whole thing
again,

01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:57.590
you know something about a
bond, but you're subject to more

01:10:57.590 --> 01:11:01.260
risk besides what you know.
 

01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:04.703
You hedge out the extra risk,
still relying on yourself to be

01:11:04.703 --> 01:11:06.310
right about what you know.
 

01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:08.880
You relied on your being right
about the prepayments.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.569
You don't know anything about
the future interest rates.

01:11:11.569 --> 01:11:14.264
But there's another guy like
the trader in the World Series,

01:11:14.264 --> 01:11:17.003
the broker in the World Series,
who's willing to make bets on

01:11:17.003 --> 01:11:18.420
the interest rate with you.
 

01:11:18.420 --> 01:11:22.140
Or to say the same thing,
who's been calculating the

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.641
values of the bonds,
the short and the long bond,

01:11:25.641 --> 01:11:29.288
as if he was making bets on the
interest rate.

01:11:29.288 --> 01:11:33.233
He's calculated at the same
50/50 odds, discounting by the

01:11:33.233 --> 01:11:34.340
interest rate.
 

01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:37.320
So because there are all these
guys on the market who are

01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.609
willing to make these game by
game bets,

01:11:39.609 --> 01:11:42.341
either directly--I'm almost
done--they either make the game

01:11:42.341 --> 01:11:45.213
by game bets and the interest
rate directly in the derivatives

01:11:45.213 --> 01:11:47.585
market,
or what's equivalent to that,

01:11:47.585 --> 01:11:51.194
they've used that calculus to
figure out the value of these

01:11:51.194 --> 01:11:52.689
long and short bonds.
 

01:11:52.689 --> 01:11:54.654
So by trading through the long
and short bonds,

01:11:54.654 --> 01:11:56.960
you're effectively doing the
same interest rate bet.

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:59.301
So either way,
by trading through the two

01:11:59.301 --> 01:12:00.912
bonds,
or trading directly in the

01:12:00.912 --> 01:12:03.905
interest rate derivative market,
you're able to buy,

01:12:03.905 --> 01:12:05.979
by going game at a time.
 

01:12:05.979 --> 01:12:08.301
Year by year,
you're able to buy all the cash

01:12:08.301 --> 01:12:10.886
flows of your mortgage,
the cash flows that you're

01:12:10.886 --> 01:12:12.680
predicting it's going to have.
 

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:15.447
And therefore,
you can make the profit for

01:12:15.447 --> 01:12:15.920
sure.
 

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.435
It's predicting something,
being confident in your

01:12:19.435 --> 01:12:21.829
prediction,
then being able to buy what

01:12:21.829 --> 01:12:25.076
you've predicted the cash flows
are for a smaller price than you

01:12:25.076 --> 01:12:26.569
can sell the security for.
 

01:12:26.569 --> 01:12:28.869
That's how you locked in your
profit.

01:12:28.869 --> 01:12:29.600
Okay.
 

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:35.000

00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:03.736
Professor John Merriman:
Well, today I'm going to talk a

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.523
little bit about syndicalism,
but mostly about socialism,

00:00:06.523 --> 00:00:09.570
and then Monday I'm going to
talk about anarchism.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.754
So, in 1864 the First
International was created,

00:00:14.754 --> 00:00:20.490
the First International Working
Man's Association.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.713
It dissolved among great
tension in 1876,

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:27.420
and also under the influence of
the Commune,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.669
because of the repression of
working-class movements in most

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.220
places in Europe,
and also in the United States.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.154
Adolph Thiers,
who had crushed the Commune,

00:00:41.154 --> 00:00:43.777
as you know,
boasted in 1877,

00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:48.461
"nobody talks of socialism
anymore, and rightly so,

00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:51.554
we are rid of it."
Nonetheless,

00:00:51.554 --> 00:00:55.566
it is in the late part of the
â€˜80s and above all the

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:57.923
1890s,
the crucial decade that

00:00:57.923 --> 00:01:02.719
socialist parties become part of
the political scene in Europe,

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.817
above all in Western Europe
because obviously the Mensheviks

00:01:05.817 --> 00:01:09.755
and Bolsheviks,
when they are later created,

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:14.933
are quite illegal in Russia;
and the growth of socialist

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:18.830
parties, above all in France,
in Germany, in Spain,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.488
and Italy, are part of the
development of mass politics,

00:01:22.488 --> 00:01:25.548
thus closely tied to the
emergence of political

00:01:25.548 --> 00:01:29.073
associations of which the
socialist parties would be a

00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:32.518
very good example,
and the increased role of

00:01:32.518 --> 00:01:37.104
newspapers, party newspapers and
also just in general the penny

00:01:37.104 --> 00:01:39.822
press.
In Paris in the 1890s there are

00:01:39.822 --> 00:01:43.330
twenty daily newspapers,
maybe even a couple more than

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.349
that, which is phenomenal.
Now, there's what?

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:49.356
There's Libé,
there's Figaro and

00:01:49.356 --> 00:01:51.625
there's Le Monde,
there are three,

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:53.827
and then there's also,
I guess, the remnants of

00:01:53.827 --> 00:01:56.867
France Soir;
but there's just a couple

00:01:56.867 --> 00:01:59.650
compared to what there used to
be.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.343
And, so, socialists proclaim
themselves internationalists,

00:02:04.343 --> 00:02:08.763
and one of the great questions,
as you see, in 1914 as the

00:02:08.763 --> 00:02:11.973
clouds of war gather,
whether socialist workers in

00:02:11.973 --> 00:02:15.969
Germany will go fight against
socialist workers in France,

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:20.866
and socialist workers in Vienna
will go to fight the Serbs and

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:24.530
the Russians,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.657
Now, you can get most of this
out of Chip Sowerwine's book,

00:02:29.657 --> 00:02:34.519
but just to make a few fairly
important points about the

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.789
emergence of socialism in
France,

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:40.629
since France is what we're
talking about.

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.854
And then I'll break away a
little bit to talk about

00:02:43.854 --> 00:02:47.660
syndicalism--which could be
almost better done on Monday,

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.395
but that won't work because I
got too much to say on

00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:53.614
Monday--and then come back to
socialism and talk a little bit

00:02:53.614 --> 00:02:59.307
about Jean Jaurès,
here, who unified the Socialist

00:02:59.307 --> 00:03:02.387
Party in 1905.
So, basically,

00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:06.544
socialists in France and in
other countries are divided

00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:11.009
between revolutionary socialists
and reform socialists.

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:15.621
And revolutionary socialists
were influenced specifically by

00:03:15.621 --> 00:03:18.945
Karl Marx;
indeed, Karl Marx's son,

00:03:18.945 --> 00:03:23.615
a guy called Paul Lafargue,
whom you can forget,

00:03:23.615 --> 00:03:29.379
he introduced Marx's writings
in translation in France.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.279
And, as you know,
Marx believed in scientific

00:03:32.279 --> 00:03:34.918
socialism.
It was scientifically clear to

00:03:34.918 --> 00:03:37.567
him that inevitably,
following the bourgeois

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:40.437
revolution,
the workers of the world would

00:03:40.437 --> 00:03:43.449
throw off their chains,
after having united,

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:48.180
and led by class conscious
leaders seize power.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.818
So, in principle,
revolutionary socialists did

00:03:51.818 --> 00:03:55.699
not believe in elections,
nor did they believe in

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.659
reforms.
The general attitude of

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.849
revolutionary socialists was
that if you encourage workers,

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.769
your miners in Germinal,
or whatever,

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.509
to push for reforms or to
participate in politics,

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:16.362
in political life,
you're just propping up the

00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:19.529
bourgeois republic,
if you do that.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.057
On the other hand,
they get themselves into a bit

00:04:22.057 --> 00:04:25.133
of a bind because how do you,
if you want to have a mass

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:27.799
following among workers,
how can you not work for

00:04:27.799 --> 00:04:29.910
reforms such as the eight-hour
day,

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.857
which was a classic kind of
demand of organized labor,

00:04:33.857 --> 00:04:37.730
how can you not participate in
marches on May Day,

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.349
the first of which was in 1890,
in France, in order to put

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:48.091
forth demands for reforms?
They also were sort of caught

00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:51.028
in a conundrum because they're
arguing that,

00:04:51.028 --> 00:04:55.079
following Marx's ideology,
that the situation of workers

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:58.290
was decreasing,
was getting worse in France.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.692
But, in fact,
despite the long depression,

00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:05.759
conditions are getting better
for most workers,

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.079
even though the gap between the
wealthy and the poor was,

00:05:10.079 --> 00:05:14.803
as always, was increasing.
So, they're kind of caught in a

00:05:14.803 --> 00:05:18.140
bind.
Their tactics are to organize

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.430
workers, to make them aware of
themselves as a class,

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.730
and make them aware of
politics, and engage their

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.658
revolutionary activity for a
future date when everything

00:05:32.658 --> 00:05:37.855
would--when the revolution that
they expected to come would

00:05:37.855 --> 00:05:39.694
follow.
And remember,

00:05:39.694 --> 00:05:43.069
we live in a time now where you
don't expect revolution to come,

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:45.843
when--people just racing down
to the town hall,

00:05:45.843 --> 00:05:48.315
or to the prefecture,
and overthrowing the

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:50.946
government.
But if you had--if you grew up

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:54.573
in a country in France in which
your grandparents could talk--if

00:05:54.573 --> 00:05:56.979
you lived in the 1870s,
you could hear your

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.850
grandparents talk about stories
they'd heard about the French

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.174
Revolution;
you had, depending on how you

00:06:02.174 --> 00:06:04.741
count them, a couple of
revolutions during the

00:06:04.741 --> 00:06:07.515
revolutionary period.
You had a revolution in 1830,

00:06:07.515 --> 00:06:10.424
you had a revolution in 1848,
you had an attempted revolution

00:06:10.424 --> 00:06:12.800
in 1851 in response to the coup
d'état,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.360
and, above all,
you had the Commune.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.533
And the Commune weighed so
heavily as a way of encouraging

00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:24.002
a militancy because,
as I said before,

00:06:24.002 --> 00:06:28.507
for one brief time people
seemed masters of their own

00:06:28.507 --> 00:06:32.495
fate,
and the Commune did initiate,

00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:39.199
for all of the quarreling over
politics and over policies,

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:41.389
did initiate a meaningful
reform.

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:44.155
So, this was,
while it was scary for a

00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:47.443
conservative elite,
it is energizing for both

00:06:47.443 --> 00:06:51.329
people who want to capture
control of the state,

00:06:51.329 --> 00:06:53.456
that is, revolutionary
socialists and,

00:06:53.456 --> 00:06:56.560
indeed, reform socialists,
as we'll see in a minute,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.943
but their means were different,
and anarchists who wanted to

00:06:59.943 --> 00:07:03.721
destroy the state.
So, there's an amnesty for the

00:07:03.721 --> 00:07:08.545
communards in 1879,
and so people who were forced

00:07:08.545 --> 00:07:12.579
into exile or forced into hiding
come back.

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:18.735
Now, besides this Paul
Lafargue, that is the son-in-law

00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:23.637
of--Lafargue is
l-a-f-a-r-g-u-e--Marxism was

00:07:23.637 --> 00:07:28.540
introduced into France by Jules
Guesde.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.309
If you're on the Ile
Saint-Louis, which is now this

00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:36.681
sort of super chic sort
of tourist trap and has lost

00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:39.740
most of its charm,
there's a plaque right on the

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.685
corner, at the intersection of
the two main streets of the Ile

00:07:42.685 --> 00:07:45.067
Saint-Louis,
that you can hardly see it,

00:07:45.067 --> 00:07:48.565
it's up on the second floor,
and it says that Jules Guesde

00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:52.259
was born there.
So, he was a Parisian.

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:54.899
He was born in 1845 when the
Ile Saint-Louis was very

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:57.639
different, there weren't all
these Berthillon ice-cream

00:07:57.639 --> 00:07:59.670
rip-offs and things like that
there.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:01.370
He was the son of a
schoolmaster.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.940
He gave up his intellectual
pursuits because of lack of

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.334
money.
He worked as a translator in

00:08:07.334 --> 00:08:10.797
the Prefecture of the Seine in
Paris, and he became a

00:08:10.797 --> 00:08:13.345
journalist.
And like lots of young,

00:08:13.345 --> 00:08:17.139
smart people in his--of his
day, he read Victor Hugo,

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:21.181
he read Victor Hugo on Paris
and he became interested in the

00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:25.540
plight of the poor.
He became a Republican.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:29.689
He was sentenced to five years
in jail after the Commune.

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:33.695
He went off to Italy to avoid
serving time in the

00:08:33.695 --> 00:08:37.700
slammaire,
and there he read Karl Marx.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.176
In 1877 he created a paper,
L'Egalité,

00:08:41.176 --> 00:08:44.179
or Equality,
which had a circulation of

00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:46.778
5,000;
and you can multiply by about

00:08:46.778 --> 00:08:50.021
twenty or twenty-five the
numbers of readers per each

00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:52.820
copy,
because people read newspapers

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:56.348
in cafés,
so the diffusion of newspapers

00:08:56.348 --> 00:09:00.643
was greater than circulation
statistics would lead you to

00:09:00.643 --> 00:09:03.552
believe.
He wanted to capture the trade

00:09:03.552 --> 00:09:06.228
union movement,
which had revived after the

00:09:06.228 --> 00:09:09.559
Commune;
again, strikes had been

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:15.389
legalized in 1864 and unions are
legal as of 1881.

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:18.808
He was a very successful,
clever propagandist,

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.620
which terrified the middle
classes.

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:27.368
He was called the Red Pope by
his enemies, both outside the

00:09:27.368 --> 00:09:31.730
revolutionary socialist groups
and inside.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.844
He was also called the Red
Jesuit because of his

00:09:34.844 --> 00:09:37.558
authoritarian personality.
He was tall,

00:09:37.558 --> 00:09:41.494
very thin, and he looked
starved, like many militants at

00:09:41.494 --> 00:09:44.929
that time because they didn't
have any money,

00:09:44.929 --> 00:09:47.450
so they're living from hand to
mouth the whole time.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:52.179
Somebody described him as
always looking ill and extremely

00:09:52.179 --> 00:09:54.686
pale.
Fiery eyes shown from behind

00:09:54.686 --> 00:09:57.370
metal-framed glasses,
and when he spoke,

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:01.291
even about ordinary things,
his lips seemed to quiver with

00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:03.505
rage.
He was a powerful,

00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:07.149
ironic speaker,
but not a spellbinder in the

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:11.047
way Jaurès,
whom I'll discuss in awhile,

00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:13.953
was.
And, so, thus his enemies

00:10:13.953 --> 00:10:17.639
called him the Red Pope or the
Red Jesuit.

00:10:17.639 --> 00:10:22.541
He helps create,
found the first mass political

00:10:22.541 --> 00:10:27.655
party in modern France,
which started out after a

00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:31.747
different name,
but it becomes known as the

00:10:31.747 --> 00:10:36.419
Parti Ouvrier Français,
or the French Worker's Party,

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:40.874
which begins with some
hesitation from Guesde himself

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:44.730
to run candidates in the
elections in 1881,

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:51.451
and they get some votes.
But the goals of creating this

00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:55.320
party were revolutionary,
they are not reformist.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.383
They are not to capture the
Chamber of Deputies through

00:10:59.383 --> 00:11:03.823
elections, and to make possible
reforms that are promulgated

00:11:03.823 --> 00:11:07.796
from the Palais Bourbon,
or where the Chamber of

00:11:07.796 --> 00:11:11.043
Deputies met,
but rather to bring about a

00:11:11.043 --> 00:11:14.696
revolution.
And his preoccupation with

00:11:14.696 --> 00:11:19.052
creating this mass party did
alienate workers,

00:11:19.052 --> 00:11:23.405
because they want reforms.
And, again, we talk about

00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:26.372
socialist parties,
and what the socialist parties

00:11:26.372 --> 00:11:29.401
wanted at this time are
basically what any kind of

00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:32.429
conservative Democrat would want
in the U.S.

00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:35.439
They're talking about things
like better conditions in the

00:11:35.439 --> 00:11:38.080
mines, they're talking about the
eight-hour day,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:42.723
they're talking about decent
wages and insurance programs,

00:11:42.723 --> 00:11:46.451
and that kind of thing.
And one of the interesting

00:11:46.451 --> 00:11:49.509
things about the Parti
Ouvrier--just call it the

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.446
POF--the Parti,
well just the working class,

00:11:52.446 --> 00:11:55.032
the Worker's Party,
French Worker's Party,

00:11:55.032 --> 00:11:58.690
is--which also suggests that
the role of personality in all

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.159
of this--is they do very well in
specific regions.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:06.126
But, overall in France they
remain an extremely minority

00:12:06.126 --> 00:12:09.299
party, even within the socialist
movement,

00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:13.544
particularly because of their
unwillingness to engage in

00:12:13.544 --> 00:12:17.480
electoral politics and to be
committed to reform.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.957
They believe that elections and
the propaganda of these big,

00:12:20.957 --> 00:12:24.139
big posters that are red
posters and purple posters,

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:27.345
that are still in the Archives,
which are wonderful things to

00:12:27.345 --> 00:12:30.230
look at, that these are to be
sources of propaganda,

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:32.758
to make workers think about
their conditions,

00:12:32.758 --> 00:12:35.688
to realize that their class
enemy can be defeated in

00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:38.687
revolution.
And, so, the places that the

00:12:38.687 --> 00:12:42.962
Guesdists do very well are in
the north, where you've got

00:12:42.962 --> 00:12:45.940
large textile and mining
industries.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.046
They do very well in a very
different kind of region,

00:12:49.046 --> 00:12:51.659
some similar interests,
or industries,

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:55.899
but without the kind of
Catholic fidelity that remains

00:12:55.899 --> 00:13:00.200
in parts of the north.
They do well down here in the

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.818
Bourbonnais, in the
Nièvre,

00:13:02.818 --> 00:13:06.230
in the Allier,
in departments like that;

00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:09.380
and there are places in the
south, in the Hérault,

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:12.700
that is the Department of
Béziers and Montpellier.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.900
But, in other places,
like, for example,

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:18.230
Limoges, where the Socialist
Party was and still is very,

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.273
very strong,
and remarkable continuity,

00:13:20.273 --> 00:13:24.780
they don't do well at all.
So, Guesde is always sort of on

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.910
the outside looking in,
even within the context of the

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:33.468
socialist movement.
But, one of the incredible

00:13:33.468 --> 00:13:36.269
things about these guys,
about Guesde and Brousse,

00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:38.648
whom I'll talk about in a
minute, and above all Jean

00:13:38.648 --> 00:13:40.700
Jaurès,
is they're on the road all the

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.672
time.
And here's where the railroads

00:13:42.672 --> 00:13:45.465
come into play.
The number of speeches that

00:13:45.465 --> 00:13:48.450
they give every year is in the
hundreds.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.549
They're constantly
going--showing up in a town.

00:13:52.549 --> 00:13:54.909
I once wrote an article called
"De la Gare à

00:13:54.909 --> 00:13:56.750
la Conférence
Contradictoire,"

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:59.362
or, "From the Station,
Railroad Station,

00:13:59.362 --> 00:14:03.047
to the Great Debate," where
they'd be debating people of

00:14:03.047 --> 00:14:07.349
other policies.
And they're on the--they do the

00:14:07.349 --> 00:14:11.159
Tour de France,
giving these speeches.

00:14:11.159 --> 00:14:14.387
And it's really in the 1880s
and the 1890s that you really do

00:14:14.387 --> 00:14:17.129
have this sort of apprenticeship
of the republic,

00:14:17.129 --> 00:14:21.190
and the apprenticeship of mass
politics and of socialist

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:24.684
movements through these debates.
And that's what a

00:14:24.684 --> 00:14:27.117
conférence
contradictoire is,

00:14:27.117 --> 00:14:30.534
in French, or just call it a
debate, a lecture followed by a

00:14:30.534 --> 00:14:32.235
debate.
And, for example,

00:14:32.235 --> 00:14:35.725
when I was studying porcelain
workers in Limoges a long time

00:14:35.725 --> 00:14:37.853
ago,
you'd have these guys like

00:14:37.853 --> 00:14:41.149
Brousse and Jaurès and
the others show up,

00:14:41.149 --> 00:14:45.710
and they would be taken on a
tour of Limoges.

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:48.043
And they'd start out at the
bourse du travail,

00:14:48.043 --> 00:14:50.889
more about that later,
or the maison du peuple,

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:54.371
and then they'd go around and
see the factories and they'd see

00:14:54.371 --> 00:14:57.194
the historical monuments.
The same thing happened to me,

00:14:57.194 --> 00:14:59.521
I was there for a long time
sleeping in a railroad station

00:14:59.521 --> 00:15:02.758
because I didn't have any money,
one day out of--one night out

00:15:02.758 --> 00:15:05.190
of seven, because I was so broke
then.

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:10.676
But I was invited back and all
this thing to get an award I

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:14.338
certainly didn't deserve.
And it was the same thing,

00:15:14.338 --> 00:15:16.706
it was exactly the same thing.
The tour was the same,

00:15:16.706 --> 00:15:18.610
even though I knew the place
very well.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:20.906
And we started out having
aperitif, drinks at the

00:15:20.906 --> 00:15:23.203
maison du peuple,
that is the house of the

00:15:23.203 --> 00:15:25.380
people,
at about 10:30 or 11:00 in the

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:28.572
morning, and by the time you
make all these stops--it was a

00:15:28.572 --> 00:15:32.149
very long day and the thing went
on until 1:30 in the morning,

00:15:32.149 --> 00:15:34.450
literally, till 1:30 or 2:00 in
the morning.

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:38.338
And this is the way it is now,
in these circumstances,

00:15:38.338 --> 00:15:41.639
but the way then was much more
interesting,

00:15:41.639 --> 00:15:43.746
because what people would do is
they would go,

00:15:43.746 --> 00:15:45.899
and you'd have some guy like
Guesde show up,

00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:48.231
and he gives this talk,
he's up at the podium and gives

00:15:48.231 --> 00:15:49.750
this talk.
And there are hundreds of

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:51.581
people there.
And then the other people take

00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:53.638
him on.
Then you got a reform socialist

00:15:53.638 --> 00:15:56.964
debating with him and telling
him that he's really flat wrong

00:15:56.964 --> 00:15:58.792
about this,
you've got anarchists

00:15:58.792 --> 00:16:01.700
inevitably standing on the
outside, passing out leaflets,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.308
as in 1968, and then you had
Social Catholics who were

00:16:05.308 --> 00:16:09.189
priests that believed that the
only way you could win back

00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:12.510
workers is to believe in reform,
and they would be

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.789
putting--they'd be wearing their
cassocks and things like that,

00:16:15.789 --> 00:16:17.210
and they'd be making their
cases.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:20.878
And this was the apprenticeship
of politics, for very ordinary

00:16:20.878 --> 00:16:23.121
people.
And it really was great,

00:16:23.121 --> 00:16:25.604
actually.
And I mentioned the same thing

00:16:25.604 --> 00:16:28.856
happened before the Commune,
between 1868 and before the

00:16:28.856 --> 00:16:33.445
Franco-Prussian War in 1870,
after the Law on Associations

00:16:33.445 --> 00:16:38.289
was--on people could assemble,
the law of June 18th,

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:41.282
1868.
So, anyway people knew who

00:16:41.282 --> 00:16:46.350
Guesde was, but most Socialists
did not believe in Guesde.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.317
Most of the people who
wanted--who supported Guesde

00:16:50.317 --> 00:16:53.679
were industrial workers,
though there were many

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:55.983
artisans, of course,
and even some small

00:16:55.983 --> 00:16:59.482
shopkeepers.
And I said before he does best

00:16:59.482 --> 00:17:04.009
in the Nord, with textile
workers, not with miners.

00:17:04.009 --> 00:17:09.970
Now, he was all over the place,
basically.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:15.649
Now, he found a political rival
in the early 1880s who was Paul

00:17:15.649 --> 00:17:19.680
Brousse--I didn't write Paul on
the board,

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.890
but b-r-o-u-s-s-e--who started
out as an anarchist,

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:26.615
and who probably coined that
chilling phrase that I'll talk

00:17:26.615 --> 00:17:29.945
about on Monday,
"propaganda by the deed," that

00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:33.696
spark, that assassination,
that bomb, that would set off

00:17:33.696 --> 00:17:36.970
the social revolution--more
about that later.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:43.920
But he leaves anarchism and he
becomes a reform socialist;

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.030
very similar to an important
German socialist,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.141
Eduard Bernstein,
whose name you don't have to

00:17:50.141 --> 00:17:54.115
remember,
but was very important in

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:59.265
reform socialism in Europe.
He ends up in an asylum,

00:17:59.265 --> 00:18:03.299
at the end of his life.
He basically leaves politics

00:18:03.299 --> 00:18:07.626
and he becomes quite crazy--not
a very clinical term,

00:18:07.626 --> 00:18:12.119
but he ends up in an asylum and
has a very sad end.

00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:17.120
And he objected to Guesde's
authoritarianism,

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.779
in terms of building a
political party.

00:18:21.779 --> 00:18:26.034
And he thought that the program
of a socialist party should

00:18:26.034 --> 00:18:30.069
depend upon local circumstances
and should not be merely

00:18:30.069 --> 00:18:32.409
imported from,
say, Karl Marx,

00:18:32.409 --> 00:18:35.669
or should be imported from
some--one of the many,

00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:39.511
many socialist congresses,
wrangling debates between

00:18:39.511 --> 00:18:43.180
factions of European socialists
and all of that.

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:46.538
Now, this was kind of an
important comment to make,

00:18:46.538 --> 00:18:50.433
and it really--it influences
the evolution of socialism and

00:18:50.433 --> 00:18:53.589
communism--not this particular
choice--but,

00:18:53.589 --> 00:18:56.995
when even after 1905,
when the revolutionary

00:18:56.995 --> 00:19:00.559
socialists and the reform
socialists unite,

00:19:00.559 --> 00:19:03.412
under the leadership of Jean
Jaurès,

00:19:03.412 --> 00:19:07.419
in 1905, you still have these
tensions that go right through

00:19:07.419 --> 00:19:10.000
World War I between the
Guesdists,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.668
who believe in a hierarchically
organized political party,

00:19:13.668 --> 00:19:17.079
top down, where the leaders
make the decisions and the

00:19:17.079 --> 00:19:20.628
decisions are passed down,
and the reform socialists,

00:19:20.628 --> 00:19:24.301
who didn't believe in the kind
of authoritarian hierarchical

00:19:24.301 --> 00:19:27.725
organization of a political
party--this tension is still

00:19:27.725 --> 00:19:29.227
there.
Jules Guesde,

00:19:29.227 --> 00:19:31.744
in World War I,
ends up being Minister of

00:19:31.744 --> 00:19:34.198
Transportation,
or Minister of Commerce,

00:19:34.198 --> 00:19:37.819
I can't remember which.
So, he joins the Sacred Union

00:19:37.819 --> 00:19:40.319
that comes during the First
World War.

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:45.864
But this tension between a way
of organizing socialist parties

00:19:45.864 --> 00:19:50.130
is still there,
and it will burst forward again

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:55.660
in 1920, and the Guesdists end
up being the future communists,

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.183
with again the same
organization,

00:19:58.183 --> 00:20:01.809
top down organization,
in the 1920s and 30s,

00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:04.469
so that with the Communist
Party, when the order comes from

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:06.119
Moscow to expel the
intellectuals,

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:09.191
in 1922 and 1923,
they were out of there,

00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:12.953
and there's this tension
between the way that--the

00:20:12.953 --> 00:20:16.530
Communist Party again,
democratic centralism,

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.979
which is leaping way,
way ahead, but that kind of

00:20:19.979 --> 00:20:23.428
organization could be
anticipated in the way that

00:20:23.428 --> 00:20:26.589
Guesde wanted to--and the other
revolutionary

00:20:26.589 --> 00:20:30.109
socialists--believed was the way
to power.

00:20:30.109 --> 00:20:34.255
That tension could not be swept
under the rug by this

00:20:34.255 --> 00:20:40.170
unification in 1905.
So, what did Brousse want?

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:45.894
Well, he believed that Guesde's
program wants everything at

00:20:45.894 --> 00:20:50.181
once, through revolution,
but the result of that

00:20:50.181 --> 00:20:53.352
strategy, Brousse and his
colleagues argued,

00:20:53.352 --> 00:20:58.174
was that they got nothing,
zero, and therefore "the

00:20:58.174 --> 00:21:03.543
ideal," he wrote,
"should be divided into overall

00:21:03.543 --> 00:21:07.477
practical stages.
Our aim should be,

00:21:07.477 --> 00:21:13.420
as it were, to be immediatized
so as to render them possible."

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:17.775
So, reform socialism was the
politics of the possible and

00:21:17.775 --> 00:21:22.052
they damned their revolutionary
socialist rivals as "the

00:21:22.052 --> 00:21:25.416
impossiblists,"
because nothing would ever

00:21:25.416 --> 00:21:29.190
come, the argument went,
if you just followed them.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:33.549
And, so, they differ in several
important ways--that is,

00:21:33.549 --> 00:21:36.878
the possiblists and those
denigrated as the

00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:39.970
impossiblists--that the
Broussists,

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.729
the reformists,
said that local conditions

00:21:41.729 --> 00:21:43.359
ought to be of paramount
importance.

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:48.585
They wanted a union of all
exploited workers but that local

00:21:48.585 --> 00:21:52.910
conditions had to be taken into
consideration;

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.833
that is the goals of miners in
Decazeville, or in the north,

00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:58.410
are different than the goals of
porcelain workers,

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.070
in some cases,
or other workers in other

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:05.450
sectors in the industrial
economy.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.666
Secondly, they abandoned
revolution as a means of

00:22:08.666 --> 00:22:11.950
achieving the end,
although many of their faithful

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.569
believed that one day there
would be a revolution,

00:22:15.569 --> 00:22:18.970
but they are not espousing
revolution because at the moment

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:22.600
it seemed to be impossible.
The State was so powerful,

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:26.312
its armies so large,
and when repressing strikes so

00:22:26.312 --> 00:22:30.599
absolutely ruthless,
as in the case of the big wine

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:34.470
strike--wine workers and wine
owners strike,

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.477
the property owner's strike in
1907, or in Limoges in 1905,

00:22:38.477 --> 00:22:42.829
where they gunned down workers
without the slightest thought.

00:22:42.829 --> 00:22:46.147
And third, they concentrated on
winning local power,

00:22:46.147 --> 00:22:50.309
because if you were going to do
something for ordinary people,

00:22:50.309 --> 00:22:53.688
the way to do it is you elect
Socialist deputies,

00:22:53.688 --> 00:22:58.105
to the Chamber of Deputies,
or/and you elect municipal

00:22:58.105 --> 00:23:03.039
councils that you have a
majority who are Socialists.

00:23:03.039 --> 00:23:05.317
Now, the constraints on
municipal councils,

00:23:05.317 --> 00:23:08.517
because of the French State,
which is still the case--we can

00:23:08.517 --> 00:23:12.653
go on,
and on, and on about that--was

00:23:12.653 --> 00:23:16.212
quite daunting.
But, nonetheless in places

00:23:16.212 --> 00:23:19.688
where they do win municipal
power, they are able to take

00:23:19.688 --> 00:23:23.480
what funds they have and do
things like create nurseries,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.459
for working women.
And they can give funds to the

00:23:27.459 --> 00:23:32.334
labor exchanges--which I'll talk
about in a minute--or these

00:23:32.334 --> 00:23:36.880
maisons du peuple,
and these sorts of things.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:41.597
And, so, in working
class--because it's universal

00:23:41.597 --> 00:23:47.690
manhood suffrage--in working
class towns they come to power,

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:49.930
and there's nothing that the
conservative government,

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:51.870
which certainly doesn't want
them in power,

00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:55.262
can do about it.
And after the radicals--you can

00:23:55.262 --> 00:23:58.776
read about that--in 1898 when
they--they're social

00:23:58.776 --> 00:24:01.430
conservatives or social
moderates,

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.181
but they're--and they're very
anti-clerical--but when they

00:24:04.181 --> 00:24:06.835
come to power they will also
often have alliances on the

00:24:06.835 --> 00:24:08.670
local level with these
socialists.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.797
Now, what this does is it
serves to leave the

00:24:10.797 --> 00:24:13.069
revolutionary socialists even
further behind,

00:24:13.069 --> 00:24:14.551
because their
fidèles,

00:24:14.551 --> 00:24:15.905
their faithful,
are going to say,

00:24:15.905 --> 00:24:18.529
"of course I'm going to vote
for this socialist candidate.

00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:22.546
If we win the municipal
council, if the working class

00:24:22.546 --> 00:24:26.794
suburbs of x town are able to
elect for the whole town a

00:24:26.794 --> 00:24:30.316
working class majority,
a socialist majority,

00:24:30.316 --> 00:24:32.779
then we can have concrete
reforms."

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:35.233
And the Guesdists really don't
have an answer for that,

00:24:35.233 --> 00:24:37.856
and they find themselves,
despite themselves,

00:24:37.856 --> 00:24:41.751
participating in these
elections which--and supporting

00:24:41.751 --> 00:24:45.493
some of these candidates.
Just two examples of

00:24:45.493 --> 00:24:49.534
towns--well, or three or
four--but the towns that

00:24:49.534 --> 00:24:53.327
they--sort of model cities,
that they take over,

00:24:53.327 --> 00:24:56.940
Limoges is one where the
socialist mayor is a reformist,

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.630
and they do all sorts of
interesting things.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.586
Roubaix is another one here,
a big textile town,

00:25:01.586 --> 00:25:04.228
again part of--it's a
conurbation of Lille,

00:25:04.228 --> 00:25:07.500
Tourcoing, Roubaix,
right on the Belgian border;

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:10.350
Montluçon is another
one, down in the Cher;

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:13.680
there are all sorts of them.
The examples don't matter.

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.701
But, this again is the politics
of the possible,

00:25:16.701 --> 00:25:19.079
it's the politics of the
practical.

00:25:19.079 --> 00:25:25.960
And, so, municipal socialism is
one of those things that emerges

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.109
from these reform socialist
parties.

00:25:30.109 --> 00:25:39.086
And then it comes to this sort
of key moment in 1890--is it '98

00:25:39.086 --> 00:25:42.157
or '99?
I think it's '99,

00:25:42.157 --> 00:25:48.086
where the first socialist
minister is sitting in a cabinet

00:25:48.086 --> 00:25:51.121
meeting,
and it's a guy called not

00:25:51.121 --> 00:25:55.736
Mitterrand but Millerand--the
name you can read in Sowerwine's

00:25:55.736 --> 00:25:58.144
book--and,
of course, the Guesdists go

00:25:58.144 --> 00:26:00.940
wild because here you have
at--in a cabinet meeting,

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:04.392
you have a Socialist minister
who's sitting at the same table

00:26:04.392 --> 00:26:06.809
with one of the butchers of the
Commune,

00:26:06.809 --> 00:26:10.599
with a former general who's the
Minister of War.

00:26:10.599 --> 00:26:12.859
And, so, they said,
"well, there you go.

00:26:12.859 --> 00:26:15.605
If you believe in reformist
politics what you end up doing

00:26:15.605 --> 00:26:18.351
is--talk about propping up your
bourgeois republic--you're

00:26:18.351 --> 00:26:21.290
sitting next to one of the
butchers of the Paris Commune.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.569
There's your revolution."
So, this increases the tension;

00:26:24.569 --> 00:26:29.258
but, in the end the two parties
unify, though they can't cover

00:26:29.258 --> 00:26:32.180
over these big differences,
in 1905.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:33.985
Well, Brousse,
in any case,

00:26:33.985 --> 00:26:38.430
was a most unlikely candidate
to run any kind of a revolution.

00:26:38.430 --> 00:26:42.469
He was a wealthy doctor,
and his grandfather had been a

00:26:42.469 --> 00:26:45.576
wealthy grain merchant,
and thus, presumably,

00:26:45.576 --> 00:26:48.990
for many of his constituents,
an oppressor of the people,

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:53.415
and his father was a professor
of medicine who was related to a

00:26:53.415 --> 00:26:57.276
bishop in the Catholic Church.
He somehow ended up marrying

00:26:57.276 --> 00:26:59.809
the daughter of a Russian
prefect of police.

00:26:59.809 --> 00:27:03.529
And France is a relatively
small country.

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:06.554
In size it's about the size of
Montana, it's slightly bigger

00:27:06.554 --> 00:27:08.809
than Montana,
and much smaller than Texas.

00:27:08.809 --> 00:27:12.146
He knew Guesde when he had
been--that is Brousse--a medical

00:27:12.146 --> 00:27:14.619
student at the University of
Montpellier,

00:27:14.619 --> 00:27:17.701
which is the second oldest
medical school,

00:27:17.701 --> 00:27:19.730
after Bologna,
in Europe.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:25.342
And again he was--when he was
an anarchist he was convicted of

00:27:25.342 --> 00:27:29.114
a press offence,
and so he flees to Spain,

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:32.609
organizing a small socialist
club.

00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:36.032
Now, he accepts class
struggle--again here is this

00:27:36.032 --> 00:27:40.153
sort of middle-class guy who is
a leader of a party in which

00:27:40.153 --> 00:27:43.841
most of the members,
both activists and simply

00:27:43.841 --> 00:27:46.980
people who vote for them,
are workers.

00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.511
And this too brings out another
kind of tension--and inevitably,

00:27:50.511 --> 00:27:52.529
without making this too
confusing,

00:27:52.529 --> 00:27:56.321
there's another--oh,
God--there's another party that

00:27:56.321 --> 00:28:00.549
is created by this guy,
Jean Allemane.

00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:03.512
And we can just deal with this
very briefly,

00:28:03.512 --> 00:28:05.786
as Sowerwine does,
he simply says,

00:28:05.786 --> 00:28:09.320
"look, how can you have a--?"
You've got your revolutionary

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.188
socialists saying,
"how can you have a party

00:28:11.188 --> 00:28:12.883
that's reformist,
that's propping up the

00:28:12.883 --> 00:28:15.093
bourgeois republic?"
And then Jean Allemane,

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:17.193
he says, "well,
look at the Socialist Party,

00:28:17.193 --> 00:28:19.440
look at the leaders of the
Socialist Party,

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.595
are they workers from the mines
of Carmaux, or from the mines of

00:28:23.595 --> 00:28:27.239
Anzin, or anywhere else?
Are they textile workers or

00:28:27.239 --> 00:28:30.670
metallurgical workers outside of
Saint-Etienne?

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.870
No, they're bourgeois,
they're comfortable

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.500
doctors,"--like Brousse,
or Jean Jaurès,

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.408
who I'll come back to in a
minute, who was a prof en

00:28:38.408 --> 00:28:41.533
philo, was a philosophy
professor--"and what we need is

00:28:41.533 --> 00:28:44.873
a working class party in which
workers will be both the leaders

00:28:44.873 --> 00:28:47.630
and the followers."
So, they kind of split off.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.126
And there were other groups
that split off,

00:28:49.126 --> 00:28:51.185
too.
But, basically those are the

00:28:51.185 --> 00:28:55.397
kind of outlines of all of this.
Now, just to--well,

00:28:55.397 --> 00:29:02.153
by the way, Jean Allemane was a
typographer, and he claimed that

00:29:02.153 --> 00:29:08.272
Brousse was an opportunist,
and so he was more in tune with

00:29:08.272 --> 00:29:11.021
the workers.
But looking ahead you can see

00:29:11.021 --> 00:29:13.187
the same thing,
again the expulsion of the

00:29:13.187 --> 00:29:16.410
intellectuals from the Communist
Party in the early 1920s,

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:22.086
and this kind of suspicion of
fancy speakers and wealthy,

00:29:22.086 --> 00:29:27.559
liberal, radical do-gooders
from the middle classes,

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:31.204
at a time when people took
class differences extremely

00:29:31.204 --> 00:29:33.519
seriously.
And if you looked at the

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:37.119
Communist Party in the 1920s,
the Communist Party's leaders

00:29:37.119 --> 00:29:39.539
are miners or metallurgical
workers,

00:29:39.539 --> 00:29:42.634
and this was a very strong
tradition, to kind of even

00:29:42.634 --> 00:29:45.623
reject these intellectuals.
Many of them became very

00:29:45.623 --> 00:29:48.360
famous, some of them very famous
poets, and painters,

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.729
and things like that--it's,
"you're bourgeois,

00:29:50.729 --> 00:29:53.388
we don't want you;
you have your only class

00:29:53.388 --> 00:29:56.346
interests in mind,
not the interests of people who

00:29:56.346 --> 00:29:58.716
work."
And, so, this is a tension that

00:29:58.716 --> 00:30:02.369
comes out again in terms of the
future history of the Communist

00:30:02.369 --> 00:30:04.928
Party,
and you can see the sort of

00:30:04.928 --> 00:30:08.759
transition from these debates,
before World War I,

00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:13.105
to what will come next,
inspired by the Russian

00:30:13.105 --> 00:30:17.640
Revolution, the second one of
October of 1971.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.798
So, who are these syndicalists,
and what do they want,

00:30:21.798 --> 00:30:24.779
just to complicate things even
more?

00:30:24.779 --> 00:30:27.755
Syndicalists,
rather like Jean Allemane,

00:30:27.755 --> 00:30:30.502
said, "look,
we don't want your basic

00:30:30.502 --> 00:30:35.081
bourgeois leaders but more than
this"--even though one of the

00:30:35.081 --> 00:30:39.278
main syndicalists was pretty
bourgeois-- "even more than

00:30:39.278 --> 00:30:42.539
this,
we also don't believe in

00:30:42.539 --> 00:30:45.334
politics."
The question of how to get from

00:30:45.334 --> 00:30:48.390
here, that is the
relatively miserable condition

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.880
of workers vis-à-vis
other people,

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.013
to there,
that is, a revolution,

00:30:53.013 --> 00:30:55.539
like the revolutionary
socialists they say,

00:30:55.539 --> 00:30:58.920
"this does not pass through
political engagement,

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.793
that that is merely a false
revolution and you'll end up

00:31:02.793 --> 00:31:05.539
propping up the bourgeois
republic,

00:31:05.539 --> 00:31:14.150
as with Millerand," as the
Minister in the cabinet of 1899.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:18.831
So, what do they want to do?
Well, what they want to do is

00:31:18.831 --> 00:31:23.932
they see the shop floor--and,
again, if you want to think

00:31:23.932 --> 00:31:29.397
about this as the mines--they
see this as both the way to get

00:31:29.397 --> 00:31:34.589
to revolution and they see it as
the future as well.

00:31:34.589 --> 00:31:41.406
And, so, the radical
syndicalists are very involved

00:31:41.406 --> 00:31:46.859
in the strike wave,
from 1895 to 1907.

00:31:46.859 --> 00:31:51.130
And, so, syndicalism,
sometimes in Spain and in Italy

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.496
it's called
anarcho-syndicalism--I'll talk

00:31:54.496 --> 00:31:58.109
maybe a little bit about that on
Monday,

00:31:58.109 --> 00:32:00.059
or I probably,
I know I won't have time,

00:32:00.059 --> 00:32:03.217
so let's do this here.
Because of--again,

00:32:03.217 --> 00:32:09.309
the decentralized aspect
of--that from the shop floor you

00:32:09.309 --> 00:32:14.529
build the bricks that are going
to overthrow,

00:32:14.529 --> 00:32:17.097
on a local level,
capitalism and the State,

00:32:17.097 --> 00:32:21.009
and the kind of relationships
that people have in shop floors,

00:32:21.009 --> 00:32:25.984
on the shop floor,
are going to make possible the

00:32:25.984 --> 00:32:31.685
revolution and they are simply
going to serve to shatter

00:32:31.685 --> 00:32:33.240
capitalism.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.684
And, so, one of the
institutions that they see as

00:32:39.684 --> 00:32:41.910
fundamental, and which still
exists in France,

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:45.078
are called the bourses du
travail or the labor

00:32:45.078 --> 00:32:47.662
exchanges.
And a bourse du travail

00:32:47.662 --> 00:32:51.059
was a place where workers who
came into town could go,

00:32:51.059 --> 00:32:53.325
in order to find out if there
was any work there,

00:32:53.325 --> 00:32:55.779
to maybe get a few cents to
have something to eat.

00:32:55.779 --> 00:32:58.954
They would sponsor dances,
they would sponsor May Day

00:32:58.954 --> 00:33:02.219
celebrations.
They sponsored civil baptisms,

00:33:02.219 --> 00:33:06.292
sort of mocking the church
ceremonies by having civil

00:33:06.292 --> 00:33:09.190
baptisms in these labor
exchanges.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.994
And, so, they become part of
the socialist vision of how to

00:33:12.994 --> 00:33:17.061
get from here to there--I mean
the syndicalist vision of how to

00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:21.193
get from here to there--in that
they are local institutions that

00:33:21.193 --> 00:33:25.352
bring together unions,
which become members of these

00:33:25.352 --> 00:33:29.918
labor exchanges and serve--offer
militancy, support during

00:33:29.918 --> 00:33:33.822
strikes,
and sort of family solidarity

00:33:33.822 --> 00:33:38.885
as well.
And they are the idea basically

00:33:38.885 --> 00:33:44.209
of a guy called Fernand
Pelloutier there,

00:33:44.209 --> 00:33:49.869
and they bore his mark.
Pelloutier was himself

00:33:49.869 --> 00:33:53.779
bourgeois, ironically.
He was born in 1868.

00:33:53.779 --> 00:33:58.099
He died in 1901,
so he didn't live very long.

00:33:58.099 --> 00:34:02.052
He was a son of a civil servant
from a clerical and legitimist,

00:34:02.052 --> 00:34:05.750
that is, monarchist family,
educated in a church school.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.799
He was kicked out of his church
school for writing an

00:34:08.799 --> 00:34:11.906
anti-clerical novel.
He failed his baccalaureate,

00:34:11.906 --> 00:34:14.761
his bac,
that is the big exam that you

00:34:14.761 --> 00:34:18.199
take after lycée,
after high school.

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:19.817
And it used to be only
thirty-five percent of the

00:34:19.817 --> 00:34:21.333
people passed,
then fifty percent and now it's

00:34:21.333 --> 00:34:22.849
up to eighty-five or something
like that,

00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:24.326
quatre-vingt-cinq,
or something,

00:34:24.326 --> 00:34:25.880
but it's still a huge tension,
a huge,

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.060
huge, huge tension when you
take the bac--amazing.

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:33.083
But he failed the bac.
But he'd already contracted

00:34:33.083 --> 00:34:36.156
that working class disease that
killed miners,

00:34:36.156 --> 00:34:39.980
and porcelain workers,
and all sorts of other people;

00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.500
he had contracted TB,
tuberculosis.

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:47.733
He was a journalist but he had
to drop out of journalism after

00:34:47.733 --> 00:34:50.510
eighteen months,
for medical purposes.

00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:56.980
He emerged from all of this a
changed man.

00:34:56.980 --> 00:35:01.418
He knew he was dying,
and so when he wrote about the

00:35:01.418 --> 00:35:06.747
dying society of capitalism,
he was also obviously writing

00:35:06.747 --> 00:35:10.869
about his dying,
his death in this capitalist

00:35:10.869 --> 00:35:13.113
society.
And I don't know where he

00:35:13.113 --> 00:35:15.684
contracted the disease,
he did not contract--you could

00:35:15.684 --> 00:35:18.596
contract it in various ways but
he did not contract it in the

00:35:18.596 --> 00:35:20.926
mines.
So, he believed that only the

00:35:20.926 --> 00:35:24.829
working class could regenerate
the world, that is not himself,

00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:26.994
as a bourgeois,
but only workers--so,

00:35:26.994 --> 00:35:29.880
here again, he's very much like
Jean Allemane,

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.639
there--and, ultimately,
what you'd have is a free

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:37.713
association of producers that
would rather be like an

00:35:37.713 --> 00:35:42.171
extension of the shop floor,
and the bourse du

00:35:42.171 --> 00:35:46.550
travail.
And the difference between him

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:52.045
and the anarchists was that he
still believed in class

00:35:52.045 --> 00:35:54.732
struggle,
where for the anarchists it was

00:35:54.732 --> 00:35:57.477
more--in which the working class
was privileged--but for the

00:35:57.477 --> 00:35:59.990
anarchists it was mostly the
poor against the rich,

00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:05.114
and also against the State.
The bourse du travail

00:36:05.114 --> 00:36:06.555
created libraries,
for example,

00:36:06.555 --> 00:36:08.380
for workers who'd come in and
read.

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.869
And, so, one of the differences
that it made,

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:13.019
if you had a socialist
municipality,

00:36:13.019 --> 00:36:15.764
is that the socialist
municipality would give money to

00:36:15.764 --> 00:36:20.257
the bourse du travail,
whereas in reactionary towns or

00:36:20.257 --> 00:36:25.099
towns that--dominated by
radicals, or opportunists,

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:29.834
in the political sense,
then they wouldn't give money

00:36:29.834 --> 00:36:35.117
to the bourse du travail.
And, so, those are the

00:36:35.117 --> 00:36:38.950
syndicalists.
And as far as Georges Sorel,

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:42.349
Sorel, who was an engineer,
his, really,

00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:47.144
contribution was to come up
with the idea of the general

00:36:47.144 --> 00:36:50.199
strike,
the general strike.

00:36:50.199 --> 00:36:53.827
And the general strike,
he calls it a myth,

00:36:53.827 --> 00:36:57.800
a myth not in a sense that it
doesn't exist,

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:03.126
but a myth in the sense that
it's a sort of overwhelming,

00:37:03.126 --> 00:37:07.717
given of the possible,
that can motivate people to

00:37:07.717 --> 00:37:10.709
take militant,
working class action,

00:37:10.709 --> 00:37:15.239
and that one day everybody
would simply put down their

00:37:15.239 --> 00:37:19.152
tools,
put down their--take off their

00:37:19.152 --> 00:37:24.699
work outfit, and shut capitalism
down by simply saying,

00:37:24.699 --> 00:37:27.268
"we're not going to work
anymore," and the whole thing

00:37:27.268 --> 00:37:30.949
collapsed.
Was it naïve?

00:37:30.949 --> 00:37:32.179
Well, obviously it was
naïve;

00:37:32.179 --> 00:37:36.369
but, this was Sorel's,
among others,

00:37:36.369 --> 00:37:40.440
big contribution to
syndicalism.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.373
And, again, when these strikes
move from factory to factory,

00:37:45.373 --> 00:37:48.823
in towns like Limoges,
in towns like Roubaix,

00:37:48.823 --> 00:37:51.250
and in other places,
in Saint-Etienne,

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:53.940
there was a sense among
conservatives,

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:56.519
as among working people,
"is this the general strike?

00:37:56.519 --> 00:37:59.909
Will everybody shut the place
down?"

00:37:59.909 --> 00:38:02.343
And workers during strikes,
they would go from factory to

00:38:02.343 --> 00:38:04.429
factory, trying to get other
people to go out.

00:38:04.429 --> 00:38:07.280
And who knows if the factories
up the road will go out.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.812
And pretty soon Lyon,
rumors of Lyon going out,

00:38:09.812 --> 00:38:11.739
and then it shuts down in
Nantes,

00:38:11.739 --> 00:38:16.358
and pretty soon you can bring
capitalism down with the general

00:38:16.358 --> 00:38:19.042
strike.
It doesn't really work out that

00:38:19.042 --> 00:38:21.819
way, obviously,
and what's called the heroic

00:38:21.819 --> 00:38:24.926
age of syndicalism,
that is of strikes,

00:38:24.926 --> 00:38:28.742
of strike movements,
goes from 1895 to 1907,

00:38:28.742 --> 00:38:36.546
and then it sort of shuts down.
Now, how did the Socialist

00:38:36.546 --> 00:38:44.100
Party become unified in 1905?
And, again, all of the tensions

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:47.179
within the Socialist Party are
not eliminated;

00:38:47.179 --> 00:38:51.151
but, the French Socialist Party
becomes a major,

00:38:51.151 --> 00:38:55.558
major force in French politics,
and that was largely through

00:38:55.558 --> 00:38:58.737
the work of Jean Jaurès,
who I want to take a few

00:38:58.737 --> 00:39:02.541
minutes to discuss now.
Now, in Germany the SPD,

00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:08.392
or the German Social Democratic
Party, is the largest party in

00:39:08.392 --> 00:39:12.402
the Reichstag by 1914.
But it doesn't make any

00:39:12.402 --> 00:39:16.327
difference, because in 1914
Germany is still an autocracy

00:39:16.327 --> 00:39:21.766
run by this sort of madcap,
ridiculous, extraordinarily

00:39:21.766 --> 00:39:29.550
stupid--don't get me going--but
extraordinarily stupid Kaiser,

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:33.496
and--but, in France it did make
a difference because France was

00:39:33.496 --> 00:39:36.177
a parliamentary regime--well,
you can't call France a

00:39:36.177 --> 00:39:37.870
democracy because women didn't
have the right to vote,

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:41.185
but it's a parliamentary regime.
And Jean Jaurès by his

00:39:41.185 --> 00:39:44.422
personal charisma and
intellectual energy becomes the

00:39:44.422 --> 00:39:47.409
unifying force of the French
Socialist party.

00:39:47.409 --> 00:39:50.981
And, again, in 1981 when
Francois Mitterrand was elected

00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:53.459
President of France,
the first thing he does,

00:39:53.459 --> 00:39:55.820
as the cameras follow him
around the Panthéon,

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:59.489
he goes and to pay homage to
Jean Jaurès.

00:39:59.489 --> 00:40:03.762
So, what--his importance is he
creates a unified Socialist

00:40:03.762 --> 00:40:06.610
Party out of these various
factions,

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:11.728
and he gives it too an impetus,
and a popularity,

00:40:11.728 --> 00:40:17.593
and a wide range that would
carry it basically after his

00:40:17.593 --> 00:40:21.866
death,
on the^( )thirty-first of July,

00:40:21.866 --> 00:40:26.210
1914, carry it into the 1920s,
and 1930s,

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:29.507
and beyond.
Despite later claims,

00:40:29.507 --> 00:40:32.710
he was a bourgeois by birth.
His family had included

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.449
merchants and lawyers,
two admirals and a bishop.

00:40:35.449 --> 00:40:38.309
His father was the poorest of
the family;

00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:42.989
although, he had married the
daughter of a successful cloth

00:40:42.989 --> 00:40:46.494
manufacturer.
He ends up having failed at

00:40:46.494 --> 00:40:51.255
business with a rather small
farm of fifteen acres in the

00:40:51.255 --> 00:40:54.918
south of France.
And Jaurès was born in

00:40:54.918 --> 00:40:57.918
1859 in Castres.
Castres is northwest of

00:40:57.918 --> 00:41:02.375
Toulouse, it's quite close to
Carmaux, that mine and glass

00:41:02.375 --> 00:41:05.190
producing town there on the
Tarn.

00:41:05.190 --> 00:41:07.288
It's beautiful.
It's also got some very nice

00:41:07.288 --> 00:41:08.777
Gaillac wines,
and they've made great

00:41:08.777 --> 00:41:11.645
improvements over the years;
but, it's essentially outside

00:41:11.645 --> 00:41:16.050
of the glassworks and the mines.
It's a very rural department.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:20.054
Of 50,000 people on the farms,
there were 34,000 were small

00:41:20.054 --> 00:41:22.401
property owners,
12,000 tenants and

00:41:22.401 --> 00:41:25.369
sharecroppers,
and 16,000 day-laborers.

00:41:25.369 --> 00:41:29.921
So, it's your basic rural
France in the process of being

00:41:29.921 --> 00:41:33.838
slowly depopulated.
He got his education because of

00:41:33.838 --> 00:41:36.578
a wealthy uncle,
who gave him the money,

00:41:36.578 --> 00:41:39.739
and he won all the first prizes
in school;

00:41:39.739 --> 00:41:42.039
and things like that count in
France.

00:41:42.039 --> 00:41:45.491
He obtained a scholarship to
Paris--this is rather again like

00:41:45.491 --> 00:41:47.855
Maximilien Robespierre,
but they were very,

00:41:47.855 --> 00:41:50.533
very different people and
wouldn't have liked each other

00:41:50.533 --> 00:41:52.870
at all--and he gets into the
École Normale

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.520
Supérieure,
which is one of the grands

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.895
écoles,
or the big fancy schools in

00:41:57.895 --> 00:41:59.599
Paris.
And he did brilliantly.

00:41:59.599 --> 00:42:02.954
He was third behind Henri
Bergson, a famous guy,

00:42:02.954 --> 00:42:06.705
and a forgotten school-teacher.
He got his degree in

00:42:06.705 --> 00:42:08.730
philo,
in philosophy.

00:42:08.730 --> 00:42:11.336
He becomes a teacher in
Albi--that's what you do when

00:42:11.336 --> 00:42:14.000
you get your doctorate,
then you go on to be a school

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.869
teacher or a lycée
teacher and then if--now,

00:42:16.869 --> 00:42:19.085
it's harder and harder in
France, because there's so few

00:42:19.085 --> 00:42:21.059
jobs--but then you go on to
become a professor.

00:42:21.059 --> 00:42:23.929
So, he becomes a lecturer,
and then a professor in

00:42:23.929 --> 00:42:27.561
philosophy at the University of
Toulouse, which then and now is

00:42:27.561 --> 00:42:30.968
a very good place.
He developed a reputation for

00:42:30.968 --> 00:42:34.839
being a great teacher and,
in the philosophical sense,

00:42:34.839 --> 00:42:38.929
always was trying to reconcile
idealism with realism.

00:42:38.929 --> 00:42:43.846
If you've seen photos of him he
gave a rather uncertain

00:42:43.846 --> 00:42:46.247
impression.
Someone once dissed him,

00:42:46.247 --> 00:42:48.022
saying that,
"he looks like a junior

00:42:48.022 --> 00:42:51.217
secondary-school master who will
never get his higher degree and

00:42:51.217 --> 00:42:54.103
will never exercise enough;
or, he looks like a fat

00:42:54.103 --> 00:42:56.409
merchant who eats too well and
too often.

00:42:56.409 --> 00:42:59.730
He's of medium height and
rather square looking.

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:04.073
He's neither ugly nor
beautiful, neither unusual nor

00:43:04.073 --> 00:43:06.940
common.
He had a nervous tic of the

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.670
right eyelid.
He looked bright and indeed he

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.718
was.
And when he started to laugh,

00:43:12.718 --> 00:43:15.825
when he told jokes he would
simply shake all the way from

00:43:15.825 --> 00:43:20.048
the top, all the way down."
He was first timid in religious

00:43:20.048 --> 00:43:23.266
matters but ends up being
anti-clerical,

00:43:23.266 --> 00:43:26.650
though not anti-religion in any
sense.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.852
He was always embarrassed when
the subject of religion was

00:43:28.852 --> 00:43:30.306
raised.
He would get out of it by

00:43:30.306 --> 00:43:33.050
saying, "I assure you it is more
complicated than you think."

00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:39.108
He looked like a bourgeois on
holiday in Dieppe,

00:43:39.108 --> 00:43:44.570
or some place like that.
He looked untidy, inelegant.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:48.760
His pockets were always crammed
with papers and indeed with

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.290
books--he had rather big
pockets.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:55.315
But he was a great orator.
People who follow those

00:43:55.315 --> 00:43:57.736
things--we don't have films of
him speaking,

00:43:57.736 --> 00:43:59.820
that would come later--but
really,

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.879
Leon Trotsky,
who was also just a great

00:44:01.879 --> 00:44:04.805
orator--they were considered to
be the most magnificent

00:44:04.805 --> 00:44:06.889
speakers,
really, of their time;

00:44:06.889 --> 00:44:10.980
and there were a lot of good
ones, particularly in Germany,

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:13.590
among all sorts of political
types.

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:17.901
He, unlike one of his friends,
Viviani, who took lessons at

00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:20.800
the Comédie-F
rançaise,

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.295
and practiced them--there used
to be, one of my colleagues used

00:44:24.295 --> 00:44:27.340
to practice his lectures in one
of the parking lots,

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:31.130
and he'd look at himself in the
mirror, these rearview mirrors;

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:32.940
and I don't know why I thought
of that.

00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:35.801
But, anyway,
Jaurès was not like

00:44:35.801 --> 00:44:40.320
that, he was just a brilliant
speaker, he was born being able

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.627
to speak.
And he could take his crowd on

00:44:44.627 --> 00:44:49.209
dizzying verbal flights.
And the thing he could do was

00:44:49.209 --> 00:44:52.952
he could unite people who would
come into a room and had very

00:44:52.952 --> 00:44:55.760
different ideas,
thus unification in 1905.

00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.789
Just a personal aside,
the person I know that most

00:44:57.789 --> 00:45:00.110
reminds me, although his
politics were very different,

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:03.163
was my old, late friend Bart
Giamatti, who was president of

00:45:03.163 --> 00:45:05.480
this place long before you guys
were here,

00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.869
and who died in 1989.
It was the same sort of thing.

00:45:08.869 --> 00:45:11.012
You'd come into a room with
Bart Giamatti--and I often

00:45:11.012 --> 00:45:12.710
didn't agree with him about some
things,

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.692
but almost always did,
and revered him,

00:45:15.692 --> 00:45:19.459
and still miss him
terribly--but he could--at the

00:45:19.459 --> 00:45:23.422
end of talking to him,
everybody would kind of agree,

00:45:23.422 --> 00:45:26.112
at least the momentum to find
conciliation,

00:45:26.112 --> 00:45:29.828
and to agree to this common
goal that they all shared was a

00:45:29.828 --> 00:45:32.889
fantastic,
fantastic experience.

00:45:32.889 --> 00:45:34.164
And when I think of
Jaurès,

00:45:34.164 --> 00:45:36.172
I think of Bart.
But Jaurès could do

00:45:36.172 --> 00:45:39.099
that, and that's what he did,
that's what he did in 1905.

00:45:39.099 --> 00:45:41.580
And, so, he ends up in the
Chamber of Deputies.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.887
He represents the Tarn.
The mining bosses get together

00:45:44.887 --> 00:45:48.706
to defeat him once;
but, then he goes back and he's

00:45:48.706 --> 00:45:51.803
there for always,
and then--until the^(

00:45:51.803 --> 00:45:54.329
)thirty-first of July,
1914.

00:45:54.329 --> 00:45:56.702
And when he spoke,
people listened,

00:45:56.702 --> 00:46:00.611
and when he spoke in 1905,
and all the years before that,

00:46:00.611 --> 00:46:03.332
people listened,
and the Socialist Party

00:46:03.332 --> 00:46:06.151
unified.
And when he went on the road,

00:46:06.151 --> 00:46:09.833
whether he's in Besançon
or whether he's in Quimper,

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:12.542
people listened.
And he was on the road

00:46:12.542 --> 00:46:16.572
constantly, and he became a
voice of progress and reform and

00:46:16.572 --> 00:46:19.510
reason in a world increasingly
gone mad.

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.833
And the night of the^(
)thirty-first of July,

00:46:22.833 --> 00:46:26.912
when he went to write his
famous headline about whether

00:46:26.912 --> 00:46:31.519
France--French workers should
follow into the war or not,

00:46:31.519 --> 00:46:34.989
it was one of the crucial
moments of the twentieth

00:46:34.989 --> 00:46:38.460
century, and it was certainly
his last moments,

00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:43.653
that's for sure.
So, he defended the workers and

00:46:43.653 --> 00:46:46.966
the strike.
He became a political dynamo,

00:46:46.966 --> 00:46:50.357
really, of the Left,
respected even by his enemies

00:46:50.357 --> 00:46:54.093
because of his power and his
ability to take the bigger

00:46:54.093 --> 00:46:57.461
project that was France,
of course--but,

00:46:57.461 --> 00:47:02.723
was the happiness of humanity,
and to see how we could best

00:47:02.723 --> 00:47:06.429
arrive at that end.
A most admirable character.

00:47:06.429 --> 00:47:09.564
Anyway, 1905,
for all the tensions,

00:47:09.564 --> 00:47:13.436
the Socialist Party itself
rév&amp;ea

00:47:13.436 --> 00:47:17.509
cute;lateur,
revealing the mass politics of

00:47:17.509 --> 00:47:22.042
the new era of the 1890s and the
first decade of the twentieth

00:47:22.042 --> 00:47:24.761
century,
right up to 1914,

00:47:24.761 --> 00:47:29.839
was essentially his work.
And Monday, people who didn't

00:47:29.839 --> 00:47:34.027
want to change the State,
didn't want to capture power in

00:47:34.027 --> 00:47:36.265
the state,
but wanted to destroy it,

00:47:36.265 --> 00:47:39.151
and these include some of the
more interesting people that

00:47:39.151 --> 00:47:41.460
I've known,
at least working on them.

00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:42.926
Have a great weekend.

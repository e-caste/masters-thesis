00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.487
Professor Christine
Hayes: We're going to move

00:00:02.487 --> 00:00:04.803
on now to our second literary
prophet and this is the prophet

00:00:04.803 --> 00:00:06.747
Hosea.
He was a native of the northern

00:00:06.747 --> 00:00:08.529
kingdom.
So Amos and Hosea you're going

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:11.233
to associate with the Assyrian
crisis and they are prophets of

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:12.740
the northern kingdom of Israel.
 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.620
He's prophesying in the time of
Jeroboam II.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.760
Jeroboam reigned until about
747.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.853
And then he continues to the
last king who is,

00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:25.310
confusingly,
named Hosea.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.940
So he prophesies in the 740s,
'30s, '20s, somewhere in there.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.590
He doesn't seem to have seen
the fall of Israel though.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.071
Now, Hosea is considered by
many to be the most difficult of

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.370
the prophetic books.
 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.432
The Hebrew is very difficult
and it sometimes seems rather

00:00:42.432 --> 00:00:44.886
garbled.
It's very hard to render it

00:00:44.886 --> 00:00:46.793
intelligibly.
But structurally,

00:00:46.793 --> 00:00:49.320
we can divide the book into two
main sections.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.389
Chapters 1 to 3 have a certain
coherence to them,

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.500
and then chapters 4 through 14.
 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.445
1 to 3 tells of the prophet's
marriage to a promiscuous woman

00:00:59.445 --> 00:01:02.666
named Gomer.
His marriage is a metaphor for

00:01:02.666 --> 00:01:04.870
Israel's relationship with God.
 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.659
And these chapters also contain
an indictment or a lawsuit.

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.689
Remember this riv form,
lawsuit form.

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.799
We're going to see it both in
Hosea and Isaiah today.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.083
Then chapters 4 through 14
contain oracles primarily,

00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:22.745
oracles against the nations but
also against the Kingdom of

00:01:22.745 --> 00:01:24.953
Israel.
We're going to be focusing

00:01:24.953 --> 00:01:28.328
primarily on chapters 1 to 3
since these are so distinctive

00:01:28.328 --> 00:01:31.296
to Hosea and we'll refer
occasionally to some of the

00:01:31.296 --> 00:01:34.963
other chapters where they might
pronounce an important theme for

00:01:34.963 --> 00:01:37.130
Hosea.
So again, the historical

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.480
background for the Book of Hosea
is the Assyrian threat.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.424
The Assyrians are wiping out a
number of the smaller states in

00:01:43.424 --> 00:01:46.319
the Ancient Near East in the
middle of the eighth century.

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:49.330
And Israel obviously could not
be far behind.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.324
The line that was taken by
Hosea was to condemn the

00:01:52.324 --> 00:01:54.900
attempts that were made by
various kings,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.575
by Israel's kings,
to withstand defeat or to avoid

00:01:58.575 --> 00:02:01.049
defeat at the hands of Assyria.
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.201
If Assyria was going to conquer
Israel, Hosea said,

00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:06.469
then it was God's just
punishment.

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:09.629
And to fight against it,
to fight against the inevitable

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.099
was simply another kind of
rejection of God,

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.800
another rejection of his plans
and purpose.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.960
It demonstrated a lack of trust
or faith in the power of God.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.698
Hosea 10:13 spells out the
disastrous consequences of

00:02:22.698 --> 00:02:26.652
trusting in human power or
foreign alliances rather than

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:29.467
trusting in God.
And this is a theme that we'll

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:30.889
see occurring again and again.
 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:33.361
Hosea 10:13,
"You have plowed wickedness,

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.882
/ you have reaped iniquity-- /
you shall eat the fruits of

00:02:36.882 --> 00:02:39.910
treachery-- / Because you relied
on your way,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.450
/ On your host of warriors."
 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.979
He was suggesting inaction.
 

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:48.376
Now, that surely would have
been viewed by the king and the

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.650
court as against all reason.
 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.390
But this was Hosea's insistence.
 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.550
Israel was faced with a choice.
 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.400
In whom should she place her
trust?

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.310
In God, or in human leaders and
their armies?

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.861
Hosea 1:7 goes so far as to
suggest that actually the moment

00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:08.750
of decision has past for the
northern kingdom.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.608
There's still some hope for the
southern kingdom,

00:03:10.608 --> 00:03:12.931
but the northern kingdom has
obviously made its choice and it

00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:13.900
was the wrong choice.
 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.548
Hosea says that God says,
"…I will no longer

00:03:17.548 --> 00:03:19.580
accept the house of Israel or
pardon them.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.689
(But I will accept the House of
Judah.

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.009
And I will give them victory
through the Lord their God;"

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.580
-- a victory through the Lord
their God.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.059
"I will not give them victory
with bow and sword and battle,

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:30.611
by horses and riders."
If you think that's what gives

00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.860
you victory you're mistaken.
 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.940
Some see that verse as perhaps
a later interpolation into

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.548
Hosea;
it has such a positive

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:38.460
assessment of the southern
kingdom.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.612
But there is this sense of
impending disaster that

00:03:41.612 --> 00:03:44.250
resonates throughout the Book of
Hosea.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.239
Chapter 8:7,
"They sow wind,

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.922
/ And they shall reap
whirlwind-- / Standing stalks

00:03:49.922 --> 00:03:53.090
devoid of ears / And yielding no
flour.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.820
/ If they do yield any,
Strangers shall devour it.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.547
/ Israel is bewildered;"
So the catastrophe is

00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:04.208
unavoidable, and Hosea's often
been described as painting a

00:04:04.208 --> 00:04:06.780
portrait of unrelieved gloom.
 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.545
He's very grim.
He seems to hold out no real

00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:12.691
hope for Israel.
She has to pay the price for

00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:14.409
her infidelity to God.
 

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.220
But we need to look a little
more closely at some of the

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.439
themes of the book before we
accept that evaluation entirely.

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.298
And I think the one overarching
theme that helps us organize

00:04:23.298 --> 00:04:25.430
most of the material in the Book
of Hosea,

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.571
and one that shows its deep
indebtedness to or

00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:29.949
interconnectedness with the Book
of Deuteronomy,

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:32.492
is the theme of covenant,
particularly Deuteronomy's

00:04:32.492 --> 00:04:33.540
notion of covenant.
 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.416
So I put covenant at the top
there and we see this theme

00:04:36.416 --> 00:04:38.769
being played out in several
different ways.

00:04:38.769 --> 00:04:41.527
The first I've just discussed:
as Yahweh's covenant

00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:44.230
partner--as the vassal of the
covenant partner,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.830
Yahweh, the sovereign--Israel
should be placing her confidence

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.069
entirely in Yahweh.
 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:52.346
Any foreign alliance,
any alliance with Egypt against

00:04:52.346 --> 00:04:55.370
Assyria for example,
is against the terms of that

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.033
covenant,
that exclusive treaty between

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:00.469
God and Israel.
And she should not be relying

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.966
on her military might,
but relying on the sovereign,

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:05.405
the suzerain.
So anything short of complete

00:05:05.405 --> 00:05:09.002
trust in Yahweh's power to save
the vassal Israel is a violation

00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:10.829
of the terms of the covenant.
 

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:13.151
So we see it in the notion of
its confidence,

00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:16.000
exclusive confidence and trust
in God and his power.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.378
A second way in which the theme
of covenant is expressed is

00:05:19.378 --> 00:05:22.757
found in Hosea's denunciation of
social injustice and moral

00:05:22.757 --> 00:05:25.036
decay,
and of course this is a theme

00:05:25.036 --> 00:05:26.850
that's common to the prophets.
 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.110
Here he follows Amos.
 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.545
But he's now the first to couch
his charge in the form of this

00:05:33.545 --> 00:05:36.729
formal riv,
or lawsuit, in which God is

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.572
said to bring a charge against
Israel for violating the terms

00:05:40.572 --> 00:05:43.079
of the covenant,
for breach of covenant.

00:05:43.079 --> 00:05:45.605
This happens in chapter 4,
the first three verses of

00:05:45.605 --> 00:05:47.139
chapter 4--Israel is charged.
 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.418
And Hosea employs language that
deliberately invokes the

00:05:51.418 --> 00:05:53.710
Decalogue:
Hear the word of the Lord,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.009
O people of Israel!
 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:05:57.139
For the Lord has a case [=a
lawsuit]

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:58.860
against the inhabitants of this
land,

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.209
Because there is no honesty and
no goodness

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:03.220
And no obedience to God in the
land.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.234
[False]
swearing, dishonesty,

00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:07.805
and murder,
And theft and adultery are

00:06:07.805 --> 00:06:10.375
rife.
Picking out key terms from the

00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:13.323
Decalogue: false swearing;
murder, theft and adultery,

00:06:13.323 --> 00:06:16.000
which of course occur in a
threesome in the Decalogue.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.030
These things are rife.
 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.290
"Crime follows upon crime!
 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.359
/ For that, the earth is
withered: / Everything that

00:06:23.359 --> 00:06:26.910
dwells on it languishes-- /
Beasts of the field and birds of

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.860
the sky-- / Even the fish of the
sea perish."

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.062
Unlike Amos,
Hosea also engages in a

00:06:33.062 --> 00:06:37.270
prolonged or sustained
condemnation of Israel's

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.027
religious faithlessness,
which is figured in terms of

00:06:42.027 --> 00:06:44.853
adultery.
And so here again,

00:06:44.853 --> 00:06:48.890
the theme of covenant is
dominant and organizes the

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.990
prophet's presentation.
 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:54.629
To represent Israel's
faithlessness he invokes other

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:57.912
types of covenantal
relationships as metaphors,

00:06:57.912 --> 00:07:00.910
most notably the metaphor of
marriage.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.007
Marriage can be referred to as
a brit,

00:07:03.007 --> 00:07:05.628
as a covenant between a husband
and wife, and so it's an

00:07:05.628 --> 00:07:06.819
appropriate metaphor.
 

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:10.120
And we see it primarily in
chapters 1 through 3.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:13.576
He addresses the relationship
between Yahweh and Israel

00:07:13.576 --> 00:07:16.776
through the metaphor of
marriage, and Israel is the

00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:18.759
unfaithful adulterous wife.
 

00:07:18.759 --> 00:07:21.076
He describes,
in lurid terms,

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:24.634
her lecherous addiction to
images and idols,

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:27.529
her adulterous worship of Baal.
 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:30.468
He points to the nation's
leaders and their failures,

00:07:30.468 --> 00:07:33.520
the kings and the priests,
their failure to prevent the

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.949
peoples' waywardness,
their debauchery.

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:39.709
The first chapter is reported
in the third person.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:44.332
And this contains God's command
to Hosea to marry a promiscuous

00:07:44.332 --> 00:07:48.879
woman as a symbol of God's own
marriage with a faithless wife,

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:51.346
Israel.
"Go, get yourself a wife of

00:07:51.346 --> 00:07:53.480
whoredom and children of
whoredom;

00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.870
for the land will stray from
following the Lord."

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:59.384
(1:2) So he marries this woman
named Gomer and she bears three

00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.920
children who have very
inauspicious names.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.560
These names are symbolic of
God's anger over Israel's

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.079
religious infidelity:
(1) Jezreel.

00:08:08.079 --> 00:08:13.509
Jezreel because God plans to
punish Jehu for his slaughter of

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:15.319
the house of Ahab.
 

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:17.196
Even though Ahab was no
favorite of God,

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:19.794
you still should not raise your
hand against the Lord's

00:08:19.794 --> 00:08:22.004
anointed.
And so Jehu will have to

00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:24.250
be--Ahab will have to be
avenged.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.230
Jehu will have to be punished
at Jezreel, which is where the

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.010
murder happened.
(2) Lo-ruhamah,

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:32.142
which means "not loved,
not forgiven," because God will

00:08:32.142 --> 00:08:35.507
no longer love or forgive or
pardon the House of Israel and

00:08:35.507 --> 00:08:38.059
(3) the third child's name is
Lo-ammi ,

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:42.530
"not my people," a sign that
God has dissolved the covenant

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.991
bond.
He's rejected Israel as his

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:46.769
people--divorced Israel.
 

00:08:46.769 --> 00:08:52.341
There really could be no more
stark and shocking denial of the

00:08:52.341 --> 00:08:54.259
covenant than this.
 

00:08:54.259 --> 00:08:59.197
Chapter 3 contains a first
person (Hosea's first-person)

00:08:59.197 --> 00:09:02.250
account of God's command to him.
 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:06.021
There it's said that God
commands him to befriend,

00:09:06.021 --> 00:09:10.254
although he seems to hire,
a woman on condition that she

00:09:10.254 --> 00:09:12.409
not consort with others.
 

00:09:12.409 --> 00:09:14.748
The woman, again,
symbolizes Israel,

00:09:14.748 --> 00:09:18.825
who's brought into an exclusive
relationship that requires her

00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:22.767
to remain faithful to one party
in contrast to her customary

00:09:22.767 --> 00:09:25.379
behavior.
And then sandwiched between

00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:28.657
chapter 1 and chapter 3,
both of which have the accounts

00:09:28.657 --> 00:09:32.292
of these relationships that are
metaphors for God and Israel's

00:09:32.292 --> 00:09:36.106
relationship--sandwiched between
them is the almost schizophrenic

00:09:36.106 --> 00:09:37.984
chapter 2.
It contains,

00:09:37.984 --> 00:09:42.089
again, this sustained violent,
very violent account of the

00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:45.259
faithless wife,
of faithless Israel and God's

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:47.779
formal declaration of divorce.
 

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:50.460
"She is not my wife and I am
not her husband."

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.345
This would effect a divorce,
this statement uttered by a

00:09:53.345 --> 00:09:56.000
husband.
We have that in verse 4.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.486
And yet, this chapter also
contains a very gentle,

00:10:00.486 --> 00:10:04.240
very loving portrait of
reconciliation.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:07.744
And it's in that portrait of
reconciliation that we see

00:10:07.744 --> 00:10:10.860
another aspect of the covenant
concept emerge.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.321
An aspect that was,
again, most pronounced in the

00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:14.450
Book of Deuteronomy.
 

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:19.796
As Israel's covenant partner
God loves Israel and he actually

00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:22.379
longs for her faithfulness.
 

00:10:22.379 --> 00:10:25.423
This steadfast covenantal love
-- one of the words that's used

00:10:25.423 --> 00:10:29.170
repeatedly is hesed,
but it refers to a special kind

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.659
of steadfast love,
loyal love -- this covenantal

00:10:32.659 --> 00:10:36.890
love will reconcile God to
wayward Israel just as Hosea is

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.750
reunited or reconciled with his
faithless wife.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:44.879
And the prophet imagines a
return to the wilderness.

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:48.049
God is imagining -- it would be
wonderful if we could return to

00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:49.889
the wilderness and covenant
again,

00:10:49.889 --> 00:10:53.277
and this time it would even be
a permanent, an eternal

00:10:53.277 --> 00:10:55.824
marriage.
And the three children who were

00:10:55.824 --> 00:10:58.383
cast off at birth,
they will be redeemed and

00:10:58.383 --> 00:11:00.049
accepted by their father.
 

00:11:00.049 --> 00:11:01.980
Those are some of the ideas
contained in this passage.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:07.500
This is Hosea 2:16-25,
the reconciliation:

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.580
Assuredly,
I will speak coaxingly to her

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.240
And lead her through the
wilderness

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.230
And speak to her tenderly.
 

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:16.250
I will give her her vineyards
from there

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:19.070
And the Valley of Achor as a
plowland of hope.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.620
There she shall respond as in
the days of her youth,

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.100
When she came up from the land
of Egypt.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.974
(So the period of the Exodus
and wandering is romantically

00:11:26.974 --> 00:11:29.386
imagined as,
this time, of a very good and

00:11:29.386 --> 00:11:32.857
close relationship between God
and Israel.) "And in that day

00:11:32.857 --> 00:11:36.152
you will call me Ishi and
no more will you call me

00:11:36.152 --> 00:11:38.399
Baali."
(This is a pun.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:40.960
Both of these words can mean my
husband.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.220
Ishi is "my man," a male.
 

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.000
And Baali is "my Lord."
 

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.720
Women would have used both for
their husbands.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.193
But Baal, obviously,
has connotations with the god

00:11:50.193 --> 00:11:52.476
Baal.
So instead of calling me Baali,

00:11:52.476 --> 00:11:55.819
"my Baal," you will call me
Ishi, "my husband" using a word

00:11:55.819 --> 00:11:58.009
that's free of Baal
connotations.)

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.985
"For I will remove the
names of the Baalim from her

00:12:00.985 --> 00:12:02.660
mouth,
And they shall nevermore be

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.539
mentioned by name.
 

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:05.892
In that day I will make a
covenant for them with the

00:12:05.892 --> 00:12:07.782
beasts of the field,
the birds of the air,

00:12:07.782 --> 00:12:09.720
and the creeping things of the
ground;

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.870
I will banish bow,
sword, and war from the land.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:15.290
Thus I will let them lie down
in safety.

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.680
And I will espouse you forever:"
(back to the marriage metaphor.)

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.655
…
"I will espouse you with

00:12:20.655 --> 00:12:23.860
righteousness and justice,
And with goodness and mercy,

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.759
And I will espouse you with
faithfulness;

00:12:25.759 --> 00:12:27.590
Then you shall be devoted to
the Lord.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.945
In that day,
I will respond -- declares the

00:12:29.945 --> 00:12:31.710
Lord --
I will respond to the sky,

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.080
And it shall respond to the
earth;

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.629
And the earth shall respond
With new grain and wine and oil,

00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:39.410
And they shall respond to
Jezreel."

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.429
[the first of the children].
 

00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:43.259
"I will sow her in the land as
My own;"

00:12:43.259 --> 00:12:46.187
(Jezreel was a fertile valley
not just a place of war and

00:12:46.187 --> 00:12:47.978
death.)
"And [I will]

00:12:47.978 --> 00:12:50.850
take Lo-ruhamah [not loved]
back in favor;

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.603
And I will say to Lo-ammi,
[not my people],

00:12:53.603 --> 00:12:57.069
"You are my people"
And he will respond," [You are]

00:12:57.069 --> 00:13:00.552
my God."
So Hosea isn't unrelievedly

00:13:00.552 --> 00:13:03.997
gloomy and grim.
It does provide these images,

00:13:03.997 --> 00:13:07.448
these very stirring images of
hope and consolation and

00:13:07.448 --> 00:13:11.269
reconciliation.
Amos also held out hope in the

00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:15.685
form of a remnant that would
survive the inevitable

00:13:15.685 --> 00:13:19.048
destruction.
So we need to think about the

00:13:19.048 --> 00:13:23.194
two traditions that prophets
like Amos and Hosea are drawing

00:13:23.194 --> 00:13:27.060
on in this combined message of
doom on the one hand,

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.879
and hope on the other.
 

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:32.368
Really, what the prophets are
doing is drawing on two

00:13:32.368 --> 00:13:36.058
conceptions of covenant:
the two conceptions that we saw

00:13:36.058 --> 00:13:40.419
in our study of the Pentateuchal
material and on into Samuel.

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:44.558
On the one hand they recognize
the unconditional and eternal,

00:13:44.558 --> 00:13:48.697
irrevocable covenant that God
established with the patriarchs

00:13:48.697 --> 00:13:51.940
as well as the eternal covenant
with David,

00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:53.190
with the House of David.
 

00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:56.997
Those covenants were the basis
for the belief that God would

00:13:56.997 --> 00:13:58.740
never forsake his people.
 

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:01.300
But on the other hand,
of course, they place emphasis

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.630
on the covenant at Sinai.
 

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:04.049
It's a conditional covenant.
 

00:14:04.049 --> 00:14:06.809
It requires the people's
obedience to moral,

00:14:06.809 --> 00:14:09.889
religious and civil laws in the
covenant code.

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:13.179
And it threatens punishment for
their violation.

00:14:13.179 --> 00:14:16.029
So the prophets are playing
with both of these themes.

00:14:16.029 --> 00:14:19.085
Israel has violated the
Sinaitic Covenant and the curses

00:14:19.085 --> 00:14:21.697
that are stipulated by the
covenant must follow:

00:14:21.697 --> 00:14:23.920
national destruction and even
exile.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.220
They will follow;
they have to.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.344
But alienation from God is not,
and never will be,

00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:32.660
complete and irreparable
because of the unconditional

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.356
covenant,
the covenant with the

00:14:34.356 --> 00:14:36.419
patriarchs, the covenant with
the House of David.

00:14:36.419 --> 00:14:41.742
So Israel will be God's people
forever despite temporary

00:14:41.742 --> 00:14:44.847
alienation.
The notion of election,

00:14:44.847 --> 00:14:49.424
an act of purely undeserved or
unmerited favor and love on

00:14:49.424 --> 00:14:54.323
God's part not due in any way to
a special merit of the people

00:14:54.323 --> 00:14:58.580
undergirds the prophetic message
of consolation.

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:02.604
And Hosea paints a very
poignant and moving portrait of

00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:07.299
this special and indissoluble
love that God bears for Israel.

00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:10.309
And in doing so,
he draws on a second metaphor.

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:12.784
So we've had the metaphor of
husband and wife,

00:15:12.784 --> 00:15:15.259
which is a kind of covenantal
relationship.

00:15:15.259 --> 00:15:18.612
We also have the metaphor of
parent-son, which can also be

00:15:18.612 --> 00:15:21.730
understood in terms of a
covenant with obligations.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:27.112
The parent-son relationship
entails loyalty and love,

00:15:27.112 --> 00:15:29.389
but also obligation.
 

00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:32.859
One of the obligations that is
understood to fall on the parent

00:15:32.859 --> 00:15:35.544
is the obligation of
disciplining a rebellious or

00:15:35.544 --> 00:15:38.815
ungrateful child,
while never forsaking that

00:15:38.815 --> 00:15:40.822
child.
So that's a model that works

00:15:40.822 --> 00:15:42.779
very well with the prophetic
message.

00:15:42.779 --> 00:15:47.063
Hosea 11:1-4,
and then skipping to verses 8

00:15:47.063 --> 00:15:50.370
through 9,
I fell in love with Israel

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.850
When he was still a child;
And I have called [him] My son

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:55.300
Ever since Egypt.
 

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.230
Thus were they called,
But they went their own way;

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.960
They sacrifice to Baalim
And offer to carved images.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:05.988
I have pampered Ephraim,
--another name for Israel,

00:16:05.988 --> 00:16:07.490
right?
Ephraim--

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:09.330
Taking them in My arms;
But they have ignored

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.830
My healing care.
I drew them with human ties,

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:15.779
With cords of love;
But I seemed to them as one

00:16:15.779 --> 00:16:17.480
Who imposed a yoke on their
jaws,

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.054
Though I was offering them
food… How can I give you up,

00:16:21.054 --> 00:16:23.500
O Ephraim?
How surrender you, O Israel?

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.300
How can I make you like Admah,
Render you like Zeboiim?

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.200
[other foreign places].
 

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.580
I have had a change of heart,
All my tenderness is stirred.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.802
I will not act on My wrath,
Will not turn to destroy

00:16:35.802 --> 00:16:38.130
Ephraim.
For I am God, not man,

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.129
The Holy One in your midst:
I will not come in fury.

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:47.024
You have these alternating
passages of violent rejection

00:16:47.024 --> 00:16:51.029
and tender, tender love and
reconciliation.

00:16:51.029 --> 00:16:55.098
And with these alternating
passages, the prophet is able to

00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:59.167
capture or convey a passionate
struggle taking place in the

00:16:59.167 --> 00:17:01.899
heart of God.
They're giving us that

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:04.630
passionate, emotional portrait
of God.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:08.363
It's the struggle of a lover
who's torn between his jealous

00:17:08.363 --> 00:17:10.230
wrath and his undying love.
 

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.209
And it's a struggle that is won
ultimately by love because God

00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:15.710
cannot let Israel go.
 

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:19.655
We're going to see that each of
the prophets we'll look at holds

00:17:19.655 --> 00:17:22.160
these two covenantal ideas in
tension,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.683
and they will emphasize one or
the other depending on the

00:17:25.683 --> 00:17:28.442
particular situation,
the particular historical

00:17:28.442 --> 00:17:30.846
situation.
Sometimes when it's a time of

00:17:30.846 --> 00:17:34.373
relative ease or comfort,
then the prophet emphasizes the

00:17:34.373 --> 00:17:36.829
violations of the Sinaitic
covenant,

00:17:36.829 --> 00:17:39.658
the punishment that will
inevitably come for these

00:17:39.658 --> 00:17:43.295
violations, and they'll downplay
God's eternal commitment to his

00:17:43.295 --> 00:17:45.689
people.
But in times of despair and

00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:49.598
suffering and destruction then
the prophet may point out that

00:17:49.598 --> 00:17:53.508
violations of the covenant were
the cause of the distress but

00:17:53.508 --> 00:17:57.222
they will emphasize God's
undying love for Israel and hold

00:17:57.222 --> 00:18:00.220
out hope therefore for a better
future.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.142
Now, we're going to leave the
northern prophets and move to

00:18:03.142 --> 00:18:04.150
southern prophets.
 

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:08.140
Isaiah is the longest prophetic
book.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.078
The interpretation of many
passages in the book of Isaiah

00:18:12.078 --> 00:18:16.367
as symbolic references to Jesus
make it one of the most quoted

00:18:16.367 --> 00:18:18.970
books of the Bible by
Christians.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:22.039
Isaiah was a contemporary of
Amos and Hosea.

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:24.400
Second half of the eighth
century.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.309
He was active for a little bit
longer period.

00:18:27.309 --> 00:18:31.029
He was active into about the
690s, somewhere in there.

00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:34.489
But he prophesied in the
southern kingdom of Judah when

00:18:34.489 --> 00:18:38.077
the Assyrian empire threatened
and destroyed the northern

00:18:38.077 --> 00:18:41.986
kingdom (the northern kingdom
falls in 722) and then of course

00:18:41.986 --> 00:18:43.779
was threatening Judah.
 

00:18:43.779 --> 00:18:46.623
So he's active for over 50
years and he counseled Judah's

00:18:46.623 --> 00:18:49.059
kings.
He counsels them through two

00:18:49.059 --> 00:18:51.439
sieges.
I've listed these for you:

00:18:51.439 --> 00:18:54.553
The siege of 734,
where he counsels King Ahaz,

00:18:54.553 --> 00:18:59.278
and then the siege of 701,
where he counsels his son,

00:18:59.278 --> 00:19:02.519
Hezekiah or Hizkiah,
Hezekiah.

00:19:02.519 --> 00:19:04.795
I'll give you a little bit of
historical background to these

00:19:04.795 --> 00:19:07.717
sieges so you understand them,
but those are the main dates

00:19:07.717 --> 00:19:10.490
that can help orient your
approach to Isaiah.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:13.175
We have excellent evidence,
by the way, for all of these

00:19:13.175 --> 00:19:16.299
events in the Assyrian sources,
and also archaeological finds.

00:19:16.299 --> 00:19:19.412
The archaeological finds show
destruction by the Assyrians at

00:19:19.412 --> 00:19:22.161
the places that we believe were
destroyed at the times

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:23.770
they were destroyed.
 

00:19:23.770 --> 00:19:25.180
But this is what happened.
 

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:28.791
In 734, you have the Assyrians,
who at this time are under

00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:31.515
Tiglath-Pileser,
and they're extending their

00:19:31.515 --> 00:19:33.480
control through the region.
 

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.609
So they're coming from the
northeast.

00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:39.532
First they're going to hit Aram
in Syria, and then advance on

00:19:39.532 --> 00:19:41.690
the northern kingdom of Israel.
 

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.609
So Aram and Israel join
together in an alliance.

00:19:45.609 --> 00:19:48.480
They were trying to resist the
advancing Assyrians.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.490
Judah refused to join the
alliance.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.000
The southern kingdom refused.
 

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.041
So in anger,
Aram and Israel moved south and

00:19:56.041 --> 00:19:57.809
lay siege to Jerusalem.
 

00:19:57.809 --> 00:20:01.030
So the first siege,
the siege of 734 was actually a

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.508
siege of Jerusalem by the
northern kingdom of Israel in

00:20:04.508 --> 00:20:06.569
alliance with the Aramaeans.
 

00:20:06.569 --> 00:20:10.331
They were trying to force
Judah's cooperation in standing

00:20:10.331 --> 00:20:14.662
against Assyria.
King Ahaz of Judah decided to

00:20:14.662 --> 00:20:20.799
appeal to Assyria for help,
to Tiglath-Pileser for help.

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:23.790
He submits to the Assyrians as
a vassal.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.582
He pays tribute.
We have a record of the tribute

00:20:26.582 --> 00:20:29.180
that was paid in the Assyrian
records, in 734.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.720
And this action is condemned by
the biblical writers.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:35.249
The Deuteronomistic historian
in Second Kings 16 condemns this

00:20:35.249 --> 00:20:38.059
action.
Isaiah also condemns it.

00:20:38.059 --> 00:20:42.559
So, Judah has made itself
vassal to Assyria.

00:20:42.559 --> 00:20:47.601
And this is the case until
Ahaz's son Hezekiah decides that

00:20:47.601 --> 00:20:51.339
he will assert the nation's
independence.

00:20:51.339 --> 00:20:53.000
The Assyrians are angry about
this.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.609
This is now after the fall of
the northern kingdom of Israel.

00:20:55.609 --> 00:21:00.960
The Assyrians are angry and
under Sennecharib they attack.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.192
They devastate many of the
cities in the countryside (and

00:21:04.192 --> 00:21:07.425
again archaeology confirms what
we know from the Assyrian

00:21:07.425 --> 00:21:10.542
records) and they advance on
Jerusalem and lay siege to

00:21:10.542 --> 00:21:11.869
Jerusalem in 701.
 

00:21:11.869 --> 00:21:16.156
And just as he had counseled
King Ahaz, Isaiah now counsels

00:21:16.156 --> 00:21:18.895
Hezekiah.
In the end Jerusalem wasn't

00:21:18.895 --> 00:21:21.193
destroyed.
Heavy tribute was paid to the

00:21:21.193 --> 00:21:23.960
Assyrians but eventually the
Assyrians did withdraw.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:26.660
They were overextended to a
large degree.

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:28.240
That's the general historic
background.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.779
We'll come back to some of the
details in a minute.

00:21:30.779 --> 00:21:34.330
But let me first give you a
sense of the general structure

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:35.950
of this very large book.
 

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:39.021
The claim that the prophetic
books are anthologies,

00:21:39.021 --> 00:21:42.523
anthologies of oracles and
other materials compiled by the

00:21:42.523 --> 00:21:45.552
prophet or by his disciples,
that is to say,

00:21:45.552 --> 00:21:49.375
schools that kept a set of
prophecies and then added to

00:21:49.375 --> 00:21:53.482
those core prophecies because of
their firm belief in their

00:21:53.482 --> 00:21:57.306
continuing relevance--that
portrait of the anthological

00:21:57.306 --> 00:22:01.484
nature of prophetic books is
really demonstrable in the Book

00:22:01.484 --> 00:22:04.595
of Isaiah.
I've put the basic structure up

00:22:04.595 --> 00:22:07.983
there for you.
The first 11 chapters contain

00:22:07.983 --> 00:22:10.790
memoirs.
Chapter 1 sets out some of the

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:14.494
basic themes of Isaiah but we
have a lot of first-person

00:22:14.494 --> 00:22:17.533
narrative.
Then we have various oracles

00:22:17.533 --> 00:22:20.882
against Israel.
Some of this material refers to

00:22:20.882 --> 00:22:24.630
the attacks on Jerusalem,
especially the siege of 701.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:29.220
And there seems to be a kind of
concluding hymn in chapter 12.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.751
We then have about 11 chapters
of oracles against foreign

00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:36.471
nations (that's a form that we
also saw in Amos and Hosea --

00:22:36.471 --> 00:22:39.940
denouncing foreign nations) from
chapters 13 to 23.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:43.750
I'm skipping over chapters 24
to 27.

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:46.923
They are a little apocalypse,
a sort of mythological vision

00:22:46.923 --> 00:22:49.495
of the end of days,
and that probably dates to a

00:22:49.495 --> 00:22:51.630
much later time,
the sixth century.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:55.518
That was the time in which the
apocalyptic genre was really

00:22:55.518 --> 00:22:58.244
developing.
So we skip over that (we don't

00:22:58.244 --> 00:23:02.140
think of that as associated with
the historical Isaiah) and move

00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.809
on to chapters 28 to 33.
 

00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:07.244
Here, we turn from oracles
against foreign nations to

00:23:07.244 --> 00:23:11.670
oracles against Judah and Israel
and the relationship with Egypt.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.448
This is a time when we're
caught between these two powers

00:23:14.448 --> 00:23:15.589
-- Egypt and Assyria.
 

00:23:15.589 --> 00:23:19.799
Judah is trying to figure out
with whom to make alliances.

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:22.720
Should she cast her lot with
Egypt, and so on.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.057
And these are from a slightly
later period down towards the

00:23:27.057 --> 00:23:31.544
siege of 701 and they include
accounts of Isaiah's counsel to

00:23:31.544 --> 00:23:35.076
Hezekiah in 701.
34 and 35 we'll kind of skip

00:23:35.076 --> 00:23:37.911
over for now.
These also are post-exilic

00:23:37.911 --> 00:23:41.152
insertions.
And then chapters 36 to 39 --

00:23:41.152 --> 00:23:45.137
this is third-person,
historical narrative and it is,

00:23:45.137 --> 00:23:48.049
in fact, 2 Kings chapters 18 to
20.

00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:51.240
That material has simply been
inserted here.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.990
So, those three chapters appear
here in Isaiah.

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:57.557
It's the story of the invasion
of Sennecharib and the

00:23:57.557 --> 00:24:01.261
interactions of Isaiah and
Hezekiah during the siege in

00:24:01.261 --> 00:24:03.659
701.
So I'm stopping at chapter 39

00:24:03.659 --> 00:24:07.103
even though there are 66
chapters in the Book of Isaiah

00:24:07.103 --> 00:24:10.935
because most scholars agree,
I think this is really a very

00:24:10.935 --> 00:24:13.943
strong consensus,
that the remaining material is

00:24:13.943 --> 00:24:16.440
not the work of Isaiah of
Jerusalem.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.630
It dates to a period long after
Isaiah's lifetime.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.832
I've already mentioned the
apocalypse which we think is

00:24:22.832 --> 00:24:24.220
probably from the sixth century.
 

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.480
That's embedded in there,
chapters 24 to 27.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:32.299
But the remaining material we
speak of in two main sections.

00:24:32.299 --> 00:24:35.809
We refer to these as Second
Isaiah and Third Isaiah.

00:24:35.809 --> 00:24:40.486
Chapters 40 to 55,
which we refer to as Second

00:24:40.486 --> 00:24:46.098
Isaiah, assume a historical
setting in which Babylon is

00:24:46.098 --> 00:24:48.799
dominant, not Assyria.
 

00:24:48.799 --> 00:24:52.690
And so we see that as coming at
a much later time.

00:24:52.690 --> 00:24:57.230
Chapters 56 to 66,
we refer to as Third Isaiah.

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.523
This material contains oracles
that are spread throughout the

00:25:00.523 --> 00:25:02.279
eighth to the fifth centuries.
 

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:04.682
So we'll consider those on
another occasion,

00:25:04.682 --> 00:25:06.750
in their proper historical
context.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.917
Right now we're looking at the
material that is most likely

00:25:10.917 --> 00:25:14.869
attributable to First Isaiah,
to Isaiah of Jerusalem.

00:25:14.869 --> 00:25:19.233
The book also contains material
that is a repetition of material

00:25:19.233 --> 00:25:23.042
found elsewhere.
I've already noted 2 Kings 18

00:25:23.042 --> 00:25:24.809
to 20 appears here.
 

00:25:24.809 --> 00:25:26.689
But in addition,
you have snatches of verses

00:25:26.689 --> 00:25:28.000
that appear in other places.
 

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.448
So Isaiah 2:2-4,
are found in Micah,

00:25:31.448 --> 00:25:34.009
the Book of Micah 4:1-4.
 

00:25:34.009 --> 00:25:39.230
Jeremiah 48 is essentially
equivalent to Isaiah 15 and 16.

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.326
So this kind of repetition
among or between different books

00:25:43.326 --> 00:25:46.970
illustrates, again,
the anthological nature of the

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:51.075
prophetic corpus--that these
were works that were compiled

00:25:51.075 --> 00:25:55.035
from material that sometimes
circulated in more than one

00:25:55.035 --> 00:25:57.658
school.
So if we turn now to the major

00:25:57.658 --> 00:26:00.238
themes of Isaiah,
let's note first the common

00:26:00.238 --> 00:26:03.579
ground between Isaiah and the
prophets Amos and Hosea that

00:26:03.579 --> 00:26:05.279
we've already discussed.
 

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:09.891
Isaiah is consistent with Amos
and Hosea in denouncing again

00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:12.940
the social injustice and moral
decay,

00:26:12.940 --> 00:26:17.730
which is the cause of God's
just and inevitable punishment.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.060
Isaiah 5 extracting from verses
8 through 24:

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.500
Ah,
Those who add house to house

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.373
And join field to field,
Till there is room for none but

00:26:27.373 --> 00:26:28.620
you
To dwell in the land!...

00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:30.250
Ah,
Those who chase liquor

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.560
From early in the morning,
And till late in the evening

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.189
Are inflamed by wine… Ah,
Those who… vindicate him who

00:26:36.189 --> 00:26:38.840
is in the wrong
In return for a bribe,

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.488
And withhold vindication
From him who is in the

00:26:41.488 --> 00:26:44.922
right.
He joins Amos in the assertion

00:26:44.922 --> 00:26:50.022
that cultic practice without
just behavior is anathema to

00:26:50.022 --> 00:26:51.785
God.
Isaiah 1:10-17,

00:26:51.785 --> 00:26:55.910
"Hear the word of the Lord,
/ You chieftains of Sodom;

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:58.323
/ Give ear to our God's
instruction, You folk of

00:26:58.323 --> 00:27:00.440
Gomorrah!"
(So he's referring to his

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:03.619
fellow countrymen as Sodomites,
or people of Sodom and

00:27:03.619 --> 00:27:06.319
Gomorrah, who,
of course, were the paragons of

00:27:06.319 --> 00:27:07.700
immoral behavior).
 

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.200
"What need have I of all
your sacrifices?"

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.233
Says the Lord.
"I am sated with burnt offering

00:27:13.233 --> 00:27:15.180
of rams,
And suet of fatlings,

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.890
And blood of bulls;
And I have no delight

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:21.180
In lambs and he-goats… Your
new moons and fixed seasons

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.110
Fill me with loathing;
They are become a burden to Me,

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:25.380
I cannot endure them.
 

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:28.983
And when you lift up your hands,
I will turn My eyes away from

00:27:28.983 --> 00:27:30.750
you;
Though you pray at length,

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:31.930
I will not listen.
 

00:27:31.930 --> 00:27:33.880
Your hands are stained with
crime--

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.430
Wash yourselves clean;
Put your evil doings

00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.710
Away from my sight.
 

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.340
Cease to do evil;
Learn to do good.

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:43.200
Devote yourselves to justice;
Aid the wronged.

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.171
Uphold the rights of the orphan;
Defend the cause of the

00:27:46.171 --> 00:27:48.422
widow.
These are harsh and shocking

00:27:48.422 --> 00:27:50.119
words: I'm sick of sacrifices.
 

00:27:50.119 --> 00:27:53.662
I'm sick of your festivals and
holidays as long as you are,

00:27:53.662 --> 00:27:56.349
of course, committing these
terrible acts.

00:27:56.349 --> 00:28:00.602
And like Amos and Hosea,
Isaiah asserts that morality is

00:28:00.602 --> 00:28:04.160
a decisive factor in the fate of
the nation.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.330
Again, the passage that begins,
Ah,

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.650
Those who add house to house
And join field to field,

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:13.000
…In my hearing [said]
the Lord of hosts;

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.710
Surely, great houses
Shall lie forlorn,

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:18.110
Spacious and splendid ones
Without occupants.

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:20.750
…Assuredly,
My people will suffer exile

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.410
For not giving heed,
Its multitude victims of hunger

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:27.349
And its masses parched with
thirst.

00:28:27.349 --> 00:28:30.625
So there are,
of course, commonalties but

00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:34.309
Isaiah differs from Amos and
Hosea in this.

00:28:34.309 --> 00:28:38.616
He places far greater emphasis
on the Davidic Covenant than on

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.170
the Mosaic Covenant.
 

00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:42.900
This is a key feature of Isaiah.
 

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:45.693
The wilderness tradition,
the Exodus tradition,

00:28:45.693 --> 00:28:48.851
the covenant at Sinai,
these are so important to Amos

00:28:48.851 --> 00:28:52.009
and Hosea and are referred to by
Amos and Hosea,

00:28:52.009 --> 00:28:55.432
but they have less of an
explicit influence on Isaiah's

00:28:55.432 --> 00:28:57.710
prophecy.
They're not not there.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.589
But they have less of an
explicit influence.

00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:03.302
Instead, Isaiah has an
overriding interest in Davidic

00:29:03.302 --> 00:29:06.801
theology, the royal ideology
that centers on Zion,

00:29:06.801 --> 00:29:09.799
an ideology that we discussed
earlier.

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:12.419
So we see this in his
riv, his covenant

00:29:12.419 --> 00:29:15.911
lawsuit, which focuses a little
less on the violations of the

00:29:15.911 --> 00:29:19.055
nation than it does on the
failure of the kings and the

00:29:19.055 --> 00:29:22.431
leaders who have misled the
nation and who will now have to

00:29:22.431 --> 00:29:26.039
be punished as was stipulated in
the Davidic Covenant.

00:29:26.039 --> 00:29:31.551
We also see it in his firm
belief in the inviolability of

00:29:31.551 --> 00:29:34.183
Zion.
This is a clear doctrine with

00:29:34.183 --> 00:29:36.529
Isaiah: the inviolability of
Zion.

00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:40.373
Yahweh has a special
relationship with the Davidic

00:29:40.373 --> 00:29:44.529
royal line and the Davidic
capitol, Jerusalem or Zion,

00:29:44.529 --> 00:29:47.509
and he will not let either
perish.

00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:52.260
And that belief undergirds and
informs his consistent advice to

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:53.869
the kings of Judah.
 

00:29:53.869 --> 00:29:57.511
Times of great danger are
opportunities to demonstrate

00:29:57.511 --> 00:30:01.496
absolute trust in Yahweh's
covenant with the line of David,

00:30:01.496 --> 00:30:03.420
with the House of David.
 

00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.551
The king must rely exclusively
on Yahweh and Yahweh's promises

00:30:07.551 --> 00:30:10.938
to David and his city,
and not on military might or

00:30:10.938 --> 00:30:12.700
diplomatic strategies.
 

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:17.827
So if we look at Isaiah's
dealings with King Ahaz -- the

00:30:17.827 --> 00:30:22.395
first siege in 734 -- this is
described in Isaiah,

00:30:22.395 --> 00:30:26.200
chapter 7 and 8.
Isaiah, who also has children

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.350
with portentous names (this is a
fad I guess among the prophets

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.500
-- his children's names are:
"only a remnant will survive,"

00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.627
and "hasten for spoil,
hurry for plunder" which

00:30:37.627 --> 00:30:41.638
indicates the destruction and
exile) -- he goes to visit the

00:30:41.638 --> 00:30:44.461
king.
And his advice to the king is:

00:30:44.461 --> 00:30:47.410
be quiet and do not fear
(chapter 7:4).

00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:48.900
The crisis will pass.
 

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:52.859
7:9: "If you will not believe,
surely you shall not be

00:30:52.859 --> 00:30:55.991
established."
This is an evocation of Zion

00:30:55.991 --> 00:30:58.519
theology.
God is in the midst of the city.

00:30:58.519 --> 00:31:00.660
That means the Lord of Hosts is
with the people.

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:06.490
Isaiah then offers Ahaz a sign
of the truth of his prophecy.

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:09.163
And that is,
namely, that a young woman who

00:31:09.163 --> 00:31:12.920
has conceived will bear a son
and will call him Immanuel.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:18.549
 
 

00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:22.330
It's Hebrew Immanu el,
"God is with us."

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:24.710
Immanu = "is with us", El.
 

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:29.173
So this woman who has conceived
will bear a son and will call

00:31:29.173 --> 00:31:32.289
him Immanuel.
This is in 7:14.

00:31:32.289 --> 00:31:36.659
Now, in the New Testament,
Matthew, in chapter 1:22-23,

00:31:36.659 --> 00:31:41.109
takes this verse as a prophecy
of the birth of Jesus.

00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:44.283
This is based on a Greek
mistranslation of the word

00:31:44.283 --> 00:31:46.059
"young woman" as "virgin."
 

00:31:46.059 --> 00:31:49.386
The Hebrew term that's used is
not in fact the term for virgin,

00:31:49.386 --> 00:31:52.659
but it was translated into the
Greek with a term that can mean

00:31:52.659 --> 00:31:53.803
virgin.
And moreover,

00:31:53.803 --> 00:31:56.230
the verb that's used in the
Hebrew is in the past tense.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.700
A woman has already conceived.
 

00:31:58.700 --> 00:31:59.900
The birth is pending.
 

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:01.890
It is imminent.
This child will be born.

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.369
God will be with us.
 

00:32:03.369 --> 00:32:07.507
The identity of the woman that
Isaiah is speaking about is a

00:32:07.507 --> 00:32:09.259
matter of some dispute.
 

00:32:09.259 --> 00:32:12.005
So some scholars take the verse
as a reference to Isaiah's own

00:32:12.005 --> 00:32:13.924
wife.
She's already had two children

00:32:13.924 --> 00:32:17.079
with portentous names and now
she's pregnant with a third.

00:32:17.079 --> 00:32:21.997
But the others take the verse
as a reference to the king's own

00:32:21.997 --> 00:32:26.349
wife, who will bear his son
Hezekiah, King Hezekiah.

00:32:26.349 --> 00:32:28.619
There are some problems with
chronology.

00:32:28.619 --> 00:32:30.869
It doesn't quite work out that
he would be the right age.

00:32:30.869 --> 00:32:34.599
But the fact is Hezekiah was a
celebrated king.

00:32:34.599 --> 00:32:38.141
He did in fact manage to keep
Judah intact against the

00:32:38.141 --> 00:32:41.683
Assyrian threat and kept
Jerusalem from falling in the

00:32:41.683 --> 00:32:43.901
siege of 701.
And 2 Kings,

00:32:43.901 --> 00:32:46.875
the Book of 2 Kings,
chapter 18:7,

00:32:46.875 --> 00:32:50.930
says of Hezekiah,
"The Lord was with him."

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:52.220
God was with him.
 

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.800
Connecting it to the name
Immanuel -- God is with us.

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.792
God is with him.
Very similar,

00:32:57.792 --> 00:32:59.840
very, very similar in the
Hebrew.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.299
In fact, sounds the same.
 

00:33:02.299 --> 00:33:07.189
So in keeping with this
interpretation -- the idea that

00:33:07.189 --> 00:33:10.630
the child (who he says will be
able,

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:13.614
in a sense, to save Judah) is
the child of the king to be

00:33:13.614 --> 00:33:15.799
born, Hezekiah -- in keeping
with that,

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:20.916
scholars see the famous verses
in Isaiah 9 as praise of King

00:33:20.916 --> 00:33:23.427
Hezekiah.
These verses are verses that

00:33:23.427 --> 00:33:26.376
announce, "for unto us a child
is born" -- a wonderful

00:33:26.376 --> 00:33:27.913
counselor,
a mighty God,

00:33:27.913 --> 00:33:30.416
an everlasting father,
a prince of peace,

00:33:30.416 --> 00:33:34.046
referring then to an unending
peace in which David's throne

00:33:34.046 --> 00:33:36.549
and kingdom are firmly
established.

00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:39.605
And again, these verses have
also been decontextualized and

00:33:39.605 --> 00:33:42.240
are utilized in Christian
liturgies to this day,

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:45.789
again, as if they refer to the
future birth of Jesus.

00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:49.399
In any event,
Ahaz doesn't heed Isaiah's call

00:33:49.399 --> 00:33:51.588
for inaction.
He says he should be doing

00:33:51.588 --> 00:33:53.505
nothing.
How could any king really

00:33:53.505 --> 00:33:56.168
follow such advice,
to seek no political or

00:33:56.168 --> 00:33:57.500
military solution?
 

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.059
And so he appeals to Assyria
for help against Aram and the

00:34:01.059 --> 00:34:04.619
northern kingdom of Israel who
are laying siege to him.

00:34:04.619 --> 00:34:08.099
And this is a disastrous
development in Isaiah's eyes.

00:34:08.099 --> 00:34:11.300
If we move to the second siege
in 701, we see that Isaiah

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.130
really takes a similar stance.
 

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:17.277
Hezekiah tries to form an
alliance with Egypt now to stave

00:34:17.277 --> 00:34:19.170
off the Assyrian threat.
 

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:23.321
And Isaiah castigates the king
and he castigates the king's men

00:34:23.321 --> 00:34:26.870
for abandoning Yahweh and
relying on the frail read of

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.876
Egypt.
And we find here an example of

00:34:29.876 --> 00:34:34.159
the bizarre and demonstrative
behavior of the prophet.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.610
We'll see this in many of the
prophets.

00:34:35.610 --> 00:34:37.574
We'll see it particularly in
the prophet Ezekiel,

00:34:37.574 --> 00:34:40.188
but we see it with others,
where they would engage in

00:34:40.188 --> 00:34:43.295
these symbolic acts that were
meant to shock and attract

00:34:43.295 --> 00:34:45.721
attention.
Isaiah paraded naked through

00:34:45.721 --> 00:34:49.043
the streets of Jerusalem to
illustrate the exile and the

00:34:49.043 --> 00:34:53.030
slavery that would follow from
this mistaken reliance on Egypt.

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:56.448
He denounces the political
advisors who counsel the king to

00:34:56.448 --> 00:34:59.925
form an alliance with Egypt
because they are simply trusting

00:34:59.925 --> 00:35:02.460
in horses and chariots rather
than God.

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:04.460
And Isaiah counsels differently.
 

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:07.947
He says, "For the Egyptians are
man, not God,

00:35:07.947 --> 00:35:11.989
/ And their horses are flesh,
not spirit" (31:3).

00:35:11.989 --> 00:35:15.590
The king should simply trust in
God.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:19.489
In the narrative account that
we have of the siege of 701

00:35:19.489 --> 00:35:23.806
that's found in chapters 36 and
38 -- it's also duplicated in 2

00:35:23.806 --> 00:35:27.288
Kings -- Isaiah counsels
Hezekiah when the siege is

00:35:27.288 --> 00:35:30.769
underway not to capitulate to
the Assyrians.

00:35:30.769 --> 00:35:36.226
This might seem to contradict
his earlier message that Assyria

00:35:36.226 --> 00:35:42.039
was the rod of God's anger and
that Hezekiah should not resist.

00:35:42.039 --> 00:35:45.117
But in fact,
there's a basic consistency to

00:35:45.117 --> 00:35:46.510
Isaiah's counsel.
 

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:50.913
Just as his earlier counsel to
trust in God rather than Egypt

00:35:50.913 --> 00:35:54.730
was based on his trust in God's
promises to David,

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.476
and the inviolability of the
royal city, so now his counsel

00:35:58.476 --> 00:36:02.610
to resist, not to open the doors
of the city to the Assyrians,

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.702
is based on his belief that
Yahweh could not possibility

00:36:05.702 --> 00:36:07.670
intend to destroy his royal
city.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:11.855
Isaiah 37:33-35:
Assuredly,

00:36:11.855 --> 00:36:13.880
thus said the Lord concerning
the king of Assyria:

00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:17.118
He shall not enter this city;
He shall not shoot an arrow at

00:36:17.118 --> 00:36:18.643
it,
Or advance upon it with a

00:36:18.643 --> 00:36:20.576
shield,
Or pile up a siege mound

00:36:20.576 --> 00:36:22.340
against it.
He shall go back

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.688
By the way he came,
He shall not enter this

00:36:24.688 --> 00:36:27.988
city--declares the Lord;
I will protect and save the

00:36:27.988 --> 00:36:30.404
city for My sake
And for the sake of my servant

00:36:30.404 --> 00:36:32.448
David.
Again, for the sake of the

00:36:32.448 --> 00:36:33.519
Davidic Covenant.
 

00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:38.086
And the fact that Jerusalem did
in fact escape destruction after

00:36:38.086 --> 00:36:41.928
this terrifying siege by the
Assyrians only fueled the

00:36:41.928 --> 00:36:46.422
belief--fueled the belief in the
inviolability of David's city,

00:36:46.422 --> 00:36:49.616
Zion.
Isaiah 6 contains a striking

00:36:49.616 --> 00:36:52.269
account of the call of Isaiah.
 

00:36:52.269 --> 00:36:55.983
Many of the prophetic books
will feature some passage which

00:36:55.983 --> 00:36:58.480
refers to the prophet's initial
call.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.904
And it's something we might
expect to find at the beginning

00:37:00.904 --> 00:37:02.146
of the book.
So obviously,

00:37:02.146 --> 00:37:04.823
chronology is not the
organizing principle in the Book

00:37:04.823 --> 00:37:07.160
of Isaiah.
But I want to draw your

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:11.837
attention to God's extraordinary
message to Isaiah at the time of

00:37:11.837 --> 00:37:16.259
his call or commission:
Go, say to that people:

00:37:16.259 --> 00:37:19.470
"Hear, indeed,
but do not understand;

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:22.320
See, indeed, but do not grasp."
 

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.420
Dull that people's mind,
Stop its ears,

00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.870
And seal its eyes--
Lest, seeing with its eyes

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:32.019
And hearing with its ears,
It also grasp with its mind,

00:37:32.019 --> 00:37:34.789
And repent and save
itself.

00:37:34.789 --> 00:37:37.660
Well, there's a nice literary
chiasm (before we get to the

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.380
substance of it) in the last
line: you have "heart,"

00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:43.344
"ears," and "eyes" and then
these are repeated but in

00:37:43.344 --> 00:37:45.510
reverse order,
eyes, ears and heart.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:50.333
But in this passage we return
to the kind of bleakness that we

00:37:50.333 --> 00:37:54.059
saw in Hosea.
Destruction is inevitable.

00:37:54.059 --> 00:37:58.230
God's message via his prophet
will not be understood.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:01.268
And indeed, God will see to it
that the people do not

00:38:01.268 --> 00:38:02.730
understand the message.
 

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:06.774
They do not heed the call to
repent, do not save themselves,

00:38:06.774 --> 00:38:09.860
and so do not escape God's just
punishment.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.121
It's a fascinating,
if theologically difficult,

00:38:13.121 --> 00:38:15.470
passage.
God tells Isaiah to prevent the

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.798
people from understanding,
lest through their

00:38:17.798 --> 00:38:20.920
understanding they turn back to
God and save themselves.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.922
And again, we see God,
or perhaps his prophet,

00:38:23.922 --> 00:38:28.059
caught in the tension between
God's justice and God's mercy.

00:38:28.059 --> 00:38:31.423
As a God of justice he must
punish the sins of Israel with

00:38:31.423 --> 00:38:33.583
destruction.
He indicated he would do so in

00:38:33.583 --> 00:38:35.940
the covenant and he must be
faithful to those terms.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.389
But as a God of mercy he wishes
to bring his people back.

00:38:39.389 --> 00:38:41.810
He wishes to send them a
prophet to warn them of the

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.657
impending doom and urge them to
repent so that he can forgive

00:38:44.657 --> 00:38:46.840
them and announce his plan of
destruction.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.734
Yet, how can he both punish
Israel and so fulfill the

00:38:50.734 --> 00:38:54.104
demands of justice,
and yet save Israel and so

00:38:54.104 --> 00:38:57.250
fulfill the demands of mercy and
love?

00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.415
Verses 12 and 13 in chapter 6
answer this question with an

00:39:01.415 --> 00:39:05.070
idea that we've seen a little in
Amos and Hosea.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:09.032
When Isaiah asks how long the
people will fail to hear,

00:39:09.032 --> 00:39:12.481
fail to understand,
to turn back to God and save

00:39:12.481 --> 00:39:16.192
themselves, God replies,
Till towns lie waste

00:39:16.192 --> 00:39:18.920
without inhabitants
And houses without people,

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.429
And the ground lies waste and
desolate--

00:39:21.429 --> 00:39:23.390
For the Lord will banish the
population--

00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:26.420
And deserted sites are many
In the midst of the land.

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:29.771
But while a tenth part yet
remains in it,

00:39:29.771 --> 00:39:33.003
it shall repent.
It shall be ravaged like the

00:39:33.003 --> 00:39:36.143
terebinth and the oak,
of which stumps are left even

00:39:36.143 --> 00:39:38.975
when they are felled:
its stump shall be a holy

00:39:38.975 --> 00:39:41.449
seed.
So God will punish.

00:39:41.449 --> 00:39:44.050
God cannot not punish
Israel.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:47.777
And so the demands of justice
will be met, and God will have

00:39:47.777 --> 00:39:51.190
upheld the terms of the
conditional Mosaic Covenant.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.862
But God will at the same time
effect the salvation of his

00:39:53.862 --> 00:39:54.960
people in the future.
 

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.878
He has sent a prophet with a
call to return and in due time a

00:39:58.878 --> 00:40:02.927
remnant of the people -- a tenth
Isaiah says -- will understand

00:40:02.927 --> 00:40:04.429
and heed that call.
 

00:40:04.429 --> 00:40:07.840
They will receive God's mercy
and the covenant will be

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.479
reestablished.
And in this way the demands of

00:40:10.479 --> 00:40:13.591
love and mercy will be met,
and God will have been faithful

00:40:13.591 --> 00:40:16.918
to his covenantal promise to the
patriarchs and the royal House

00:40:16.918 --> 00:40:19.265
of David.
The people's delayed

00:40:19.265 --> 00:40:24.213
comprehension of the prophet's
message guarantees the operation

00:40:24.213 --> 00:40:29.400
of God's just punishment now and
his merciful salvation later.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:33.860
While the notion of a remnant
leads to the idea of a future

00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:38.090
hope, it wasn't a very consoling
message at the time.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:41.067
Because the prophets were
essentially saying that the

00:40:41.067 --> 00:40:43.930
current generation would all but
cease to exist.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.681
Isaiah 10:21-23,
Only a remnant shall

00:40:47.681 --> 00:40:49.550
return,
Only a remnant of Jacob,

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.289
To Mighty God.
Even if your people, O Israel

00:40:52.289 --> 00:40:53.849
Should be as the sands of the
sea,

00:40:53.849 --> 00:40:55.710
Only a remnant of it shall
return.

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:58.949
Destruction is decreed;
Retribution comes like a flood!

00:40:58.949 --> 00:41:01.570
For my Lord God of Hosts is
carrying out

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:04.900
A decree of destruction upon
all the land.

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.594
Well, we've seen that the
prophet's message of destruction

00:41:08.594 --> 00:41:12.159
and punishment and doom is very
often accompanied by,

00:41:12.159 --> 00:41:15.556
often alternates with,
a message of consolation and a

00:41:15.556 --> 00:41:18.801
promise of restoration,
restoration of a purged or

00:41:18.801 --> 00:41:21.280
purified remnant in the land of
Israel.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.063
This is where the prophets
differ from the Deuteronomistic

00:41:24.063 --> 00:41:26.514
historian.
The Deuteronomistic historian

00:41:26.514 --> 00:41:30.114
is more concerned with the
justification of God's actions

00:41:30.114 --> 00:41:33.714
against Israel than with
painting a vivid portrait of the

00:41:33.714 --> 00:41:35.900
time of a future restoration.
 

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:39.628
But this period of restoration
is elaborately envisioned in

00:41:39.628 --> 00:41:41.300
some prophetic writings.
 

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:43.789
And it even takes on an
eschatological tenor.

00:41:43.789 --> 00:41:47.130
The word "eschatology" means an
account of the end.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:50.665
So in some of them,
this becomes an eschatological

00:41:50.665 --> 00:41:55.139
vision: that the restoration
will happen at the end of days.

00:41:55.139 --> 00:41:59.384
And the restoration will bring
about some sort of perfect end

00:41:59.384 --> 00:42:01.136
time.
So in Isaiah,

00:42:01.136 --> 00:42:05.099
for example,
the return will be a genuine,

00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:09.450
whole-hearted and permanent
return to God.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:10.740
It will be the end of sin.
 

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.420
It will be the end of idolatry.
 

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.499
All the nations of the earth
will recognize the Lord of

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:18.623
history.
A new epoch will open in world

00:42:18.623 --> 00:42:21.010
history.
It's an enormous transformation.

00:42:21.010 --> 00:42:24.609
And Isaiah is the first to
envisage this kind of

00:42:24.609 --> 00:42:27.748
transformation,
the end of the dominion of

00:42:27.748 --> 00:42:29.510
idolatrous nations.
 

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:33.632
When God comes to Jerusalem to
save the remnant of Israel and

00:42:33.632 --> 00:42:37.480
gather in the dispersed exiles
it will be a theophany,

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:42.090
a self-revelation of God,
of worldwide scope.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.227
Isaiah 2:2-4,
"In the days to come,

00:42:44.227 --> 00:42:47.936
/ The Mount of the Lord's House
/ Shall stand firm above the

00:42:47.936 --> 00:42:50.639
mountains / And tower above the
hills;"

00:42:50.639 --> 00:42:52.737
So this little hill -- if
you've ever been there,

00:42:52.737 --> 00:42:55.139
it's really not very big --
that the temple stood on,

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:57.722
will tower like some large
impregnable mountain,

00:42:57.722 --> 00:42:59.810
over all other hills and
mountains,

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.739
And all the nations
Shall gaze on it with joy.

00:43:02.739 --> 00:43:04.690
And the many peoples shall go
and say:

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:06.071
"Come,
Let us go up to the Mount of

00:43:06.071 --> 00:43:07.773
the Lord,
To the House of the God of

00:43:07.773 --> 00:43:09.388
Jacob;
That He may instruct us in His

00:43:09.388 --> 00:43:11.452
ways,
And that we may walk in His

00:43:11.452 --> 00:43:12.893
paths."
For instruction,

00:43:12.893 --> 00:43:14.869
[torah]
will come forth from Zion,

00:43:14.869 --> 00:43:17.110
The word of the Lord from
Jerusalem.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.219
Thus He will judge among the
nations

00:43:19.219 --> 00:43:20.849
And arbitrate for the many
peoples,

00:43:20.849 --> 00:43:23.260
And they shall beat their
swords into plowshares

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.280
And their spears into pruning
hooks:

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.130
Nation shall not take up
Sword against nation;

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:30.800
They shall never again know
war.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:35.289
Note the direction that
Israelite thought is taking.

00:43:35.289 --> 00:43:40.947
The J source in Genesis assumed
that all humans had knowledge of

00:43:40.947 --> 00:43:44.090
Yahweh from the time of
creation.

00:43:44.090 --> 00:43:47.643
And remember that that was one
of the distinctive traits of J

00:43:47.643 --> 00:43:49.420
as opposed to P for example.
 

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:52.039
They assume,
however, that humans turned

00:43:52.039 --> 00:43:54.901
from Yahweh.
So Yahweh selected one nation

00:43:54.901 --> 00:43:57.219
to know him and covenant with
him.

00:43:57.219 --> 00:44:00.650
The Book of Deuteronomy accepts
that Yahweh is Israel's God.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:03.433
Other nations have been
assigned to the worship of other

00:44:03.433 --> 00:44:04.849
gods and that's just fine.
 

00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:08.851
But in classical prophecy,
universal claims are made on

00:44:08.851 --> 00:44:10.260
behalf of Yahweh.
 

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:13.496
According to the prophets,
God will make himself known to

00:44:13.496 --> 00:44:16.039
all the nations,
as he once did to Israel,

00:44:16.039 --> 00:44:19.079
and the universal worship or
recognition of Yahweh will be

00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:20.840
established at the end of days.
 

00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.610
This is very different idea.
 

00:44:22.610 --> 00:44:26.600
And so as a consequence of this
idea, the very notion of

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.300
Israel's election is transformed
by the prophets.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:33.938
In the Torah books,
the election of Israel means

00:44:33.938 --> 00:44:38.661
simply God's undeserved choice
of Israel as the nation to know

00:44:38.661 --> 00:44:41.989
him and bind itself in covenant
to him.

00:44:41.989 --> 00:44:46.064
But in the prophetic
literature, Israel's election is

00:44:46.064 --> 00:44:48.179
an election to a mission.
 

00:44:48.179 --> 00:44:53.219
Israel was chosen so as to be
the instrument of universal

00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:57.360
redemption, universal
recognition of Yahweh.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:01.297
When God comes finally to
rescue the Israelites he will

00:45:01.297 --> 00:45:05.090
simultaneously reveal himself to
all of humankind.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:08.030
They'll abandon their idols,
they'll return to him.

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:11.289
A messianic period of peace
will follow.

00:45:11.289 --> 00:45:13.691
And eventually,
we're going to see the idea

00:45:13.691 --> 00:45:17.007
that the mission for which
Israel was elected was to become

00:45:17.007 --> 00:45:18.780
a "light unto the nations."
 

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:22.661
This is a phrase that we're
going to see in other parts of

00:45:22.661 --> 00:45:25.250
Isaiah, Isaiah 49,
Isaiah 51, later.

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:29.088
The royal ideology of Judah
plays an important role in the

00:45:29.088 --> 00:45:32.859
eschatological vision of Isaiah
because this new peaceful

00:45:32.859 --> 00:45:36.900
righteous kingdom is going to be
restored by a Davidide.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.380
It's going to be restored by a
king from the Branch of Jesse.

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.969
David's father name was Jesse.
 

00:45:41.969 --> 00:45:44.762
So when you say the branch,
or from the stump of Jesse,

00:45:44.762 --> 00:45:46.780
then you are referring to a
Davidide.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:49.584
Isaiah 11 refers to the
restoration of the Davidic line,

00:45:49.584 --> 00:45:52.490
which implies that it had been
temporarily interrupted.

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:54.809
So Isaiah 11 may be post-exilic.
 

00:45:54.809 --> 00:45:57.928
It may date from a time when
people were hoping for a messiah

00:45:57.928 --> 00:46:00.060
to arise and restore the line of
David.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:04.199
Isaiah 11:1-12,16:
But a shoot shall grow

00:46:04.199 --> 00:46:07.253
out of the stump of Jesse,
A twig shall sprout from his

00:46:07.253 --> 00:46:09.322
stock.
The spirit of the Lord shall

00:46:09.322 --> 00:46:11.920
alight upon him:
A spirit of wisdom and insight,

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:14.855
A spirit of counsel and valor,
A spirit of devotion and

00:46:14.855 --> 00:46:16.179
reverence for the Lord.
 

00:46:16.179 --> 00:46:19.269
He shall sense the truth by his
reverence for the Lord:

00:46:19.269 --> 00:46:21.750
He shall not judge… by what
his ears perceive.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:24.010
Thus he shall judge the poor
with equit

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:26.400
And decide with justice for the
lowly of the land.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.510
He shall strike down a land
with the rod of his mouth

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.900
And slay the wicked with the
breath of his lips.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.900
Justice shall be the girdle of
his loins,

00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.789
And faithfulness the girdle of
his waist.

00:46:35.789 --> 00:46:38.000
The wolf shall dwell with the
lamb,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.949
The leopard lie down with the
kid;

00:46:39.949 --> 00:46:42.950
The calf, the beast of prey,
and the fatling together,

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:44.289
With a little boy to herd them.
 

00:46:44.289 --> 00:46:46.750
The cow and the bear shall
graze.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.334
(I think the bear is
vegetarian, not killing the cow

00:46:49.334 --> 00:46:51.260
but eating the grass with the
cow.)

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.940
Their young shall lie
down together;

00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.527
And the lion,
like the ox,

00:46:54.527 --> 00:46:56.810
shall eat straw.
A babe shall play

00:46:56.810 --> 00:47:00.660
Over a viper's hole,
And an infant pass his hand

00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:03.119
Over an adder's den.
The hostility,

00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:06.972
the animosity between humans
and serpents or snakes which was

00:47:06.972 --> 00:47:10.254
decreed at the fall,
the expulsion from Eden,

00:47:10.254 --> 00:47:12.510
is reversed in this end-time.
 

00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:15.430
This is a return to the
situation in paradise.

00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:18.694
In all of My sacred mount
Nothing evil or vile shall be

00:47:18.694 --> 00:47:20.169
done;
For the land shall be filled

00:47:20.169 --> 00:47:22.550
with devotion to the Lord
As water covers the sea.

00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:24.961
In that day,
The stock of Jesse that has

00:47:24.961 --> 00:47:27.151
remained standing
Shall become a standard to

00:47:27.151 --> 00:47:29.710
peoples--
Nations shall seek his counsel

00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:31.500
And his abode shall be honored.
 

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.802
In that day,
my Lord will apply his hand

00:47:33.802 --> 00:47:36.871
again to redeeming the other
part of his peoples from

00:47:36.871 --> 00:47:38.820
Assyria-- as also from Egypt.
 

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.380
Pathros, Nubia,
Elam, Shinar,

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:42.944
Hamath and the
coastlands…Thus there shall be

00:47:42.944 --> 00:47:46.400
a highway for the other part of
his people out of Assyria,

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.842
such as there was for Israel
when it left the land of

00:47:48.842 --> 00:47:51.040
Egypt.
So this new ideal Davidic king

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.224
will rule by wisdom and insight
and the spirit of the Lord will

00:47:54.224 --> 00:47:56.489
"alight on him."
That's a phrase that we saw

00:47:56.489 --> 00:47:59.260
being used in the case of judges
and in the case of Saul or

00:47:59.260 --> 00:48:01.417
David.
It doesn't refer to military

00:48:01.417 --> 00:48:02.960
might and strength here.
 

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:07.059
It refers to counsel and a
spirit of devotion to God.

00:48:07.059 --> 00:48:10.199
And this king's reign will
begin an ingathering of the

00:48:10.199 --> 00:48:13.340
exiles of the nation and a
transformed world order.

00:48:13.340 --> 00:48:16.124
So to conclude:
Isaiah is typical of the

00:48:16.124 --> 00:48:20.337
prophetic reinterpretation of
the ancient covenant promises,

00:48:20.337 --> 00:48:24.050
giving Israel a hope for a
better, ideal future.

00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:26.774
And like the other prophets,
he declared that the nation was

00:48:26.774 --> 00:48:29.175
in distress not because the
promises weren't true but

00:48:29.175 --> 00:48:30.929
because they hadn't been
believed.

00:48:30.929 --> 00:48:33.869
The nation's punishment was
just a chastisement.

00:48:33.869 --> 00:48:36.030
It wasn't a revocation of the
promises.

00:48:36.030 --> 00:48:38.903
The prophets pushed the
fulfillment of the promises

00:48:38.903 --> 00:48:41.030
beyond the existing nation
however.

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:44.141
So only after suffering the
punishment for the present

00:48:44.141 --> 00:48:46.960
failure would a future
redemption be possible.

00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.885
So the national hope was
maintained but pushed off to a

00:48:49.885 --> 00:48:51.733
future day.
Alright, we'll deal with some

00:48:51.733 --> 00:48:53.309
more prophetic books when we
come back.

00:48:53.309 --> 00:48:56.272
Please be sure to take the
handouts in the box at the side

00:48:56.272 --> 00:48:57.000
of the room.

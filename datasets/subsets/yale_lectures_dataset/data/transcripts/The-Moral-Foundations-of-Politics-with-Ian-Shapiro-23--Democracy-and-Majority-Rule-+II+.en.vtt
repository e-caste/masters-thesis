00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.417
Prof: So today we're
going to talk about majority

00:00:05.417 --> 00:00:07.950
rule and democratic competition.
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.174
Whenever we think about
democracy there is this

00:00:12.174 --> 00:00:17.317
automatic almost reflexive
impulse to associate democracy

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.430
with majority rule.
 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.675
We saw last time that was one
of the things that frightened

00:00:23.675 --> 00:00:27.993
Madison and his contemporaries
that they wanted to limit the

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:31.580
power of majority factions as he
called them.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.150
Limit the power of majority
rule.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.336
But we think today,
reflexively,

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:42.680
that majority rule confers
legitimacy of some sort on

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.250
collective decisions.
 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.542
And what our agenda today is to
dig into why it is that anybody

00:00:51.542 --> 00:00:56.920
might think majority rule has
some important normative

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.240
property.
 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.599
Anyone have any suggestion as
to why it might?

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.170
Why should we care?
 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.607
The endless recounts in Florida
in 2000 to see who really had

00:01:13.607 --> 00:01:16.418
the majority,
what's the big deal about

00:01:16.418 --> 00:01:17.750
majority rule?
 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.060
Why should we care?
 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.069
Any takers?
 

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:32.930
Yeah?
 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.699
Student:  I guess it's
like a somewhat utilitarian

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:36.540
flavor to that.
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.452
Prof: A somewhat what?
 

00:01:37.452 --> 00:01:38.680
Student:  A utilitarian
flavor.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.140
Prof: A utilitarian
flavor, so that's interesting.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.890
There might be a utilitarian
justification for majority rule.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.849
Just say a little more about
what you have in mind.

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:53.587
Student:  Because if the
majority of the society consents

00:01:53.587 --> 00:01:57.325
to a certain policy or approves
of a certain person it's kind of

00:01:57.325 --> 00:02:00.766
like they're making the judgment
that having this person or

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:03.792
having this policy would
increase their happiness or

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:06.700
their satisfaction with society
the most.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.384
Prof: So maximizing
government by majority rule

00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:14.139
might in some sense maximize
utility in the society.

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:18.641
That's certainly an interesting
hypothesis, and I'll revisit it

00:02:18.641 --> 00:02:19.949
in this lecture.
 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:28.425
Any other suggestions about
majority rule,

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:29.460
no?
 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.620
Going once, twice, gone.
 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.930
All right, we'll revisit this
utilitarian thinking because I

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.340
think it's a very good
observation to make because

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.199
although it's not explicit in
much of the discussion of

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:53.419
majority rule I think it is
implicit and we'll come back to

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:54.590
that.
 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.781
The traditional justification
for majority rule was that it

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:03.718
somehow identified the will of
the people.

00:03:03.718 --> 00:03:08.736
That democracy reflects,
embodies, expresses the will of

00:03:08.736 --> 00:03:14.119
the people, but of course that
just puts it one-step further

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.939
back.
 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.870
What is the will of the people?
 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.419
How do you know the will of the
people when you trip over it?

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.855
One of the canonical
formulations of this idea is in

00:03:24.855 --> 00:03:28.496
Jean-Jacques Rousseau's
Social Contract where he

00:03:28.496 --> 00:03:30.377
says,
"There is a great

00:03:30.377 --> 00:03:32.408
difference between the will of
all,

00:03:32.408 --> 00:03:36.310
what all individuals want,
and the general will;

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.623
the general will studies only
the common interest while the

00:03:40.623 --> 00:03:43.598
will of all studies private
interest,

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:49.419
and is indeed no more than the
sum of individual desires.

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.610
But if we take away from these
same wills,

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.669
the pluses and minuses which
cancel each other out,

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.919
the balance which remains is
the general will."

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.197
We take away from the
individual wills the pluses and

00:04:06.197 --> 00:04:11.215
minuses which cancel each other
out, the balance which remains

00:04:11.215 --> 00:04:13.188
is the general will.
 

00:04:13.188 --> 00:04:19.028
So people have spent hundreds
of years trying to figure out

00:04:19.028 --> 00:04:24.819
whether that makes any sense,
whether this notion that you

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:30.238
find in Rousseau of pluses and
minuses canceling one another

00:04:30.238 --> 00:04:32.350
out makes any sense.
 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.240
And what sense could it make?
 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.600
How would we know?
 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.983
As I said, how would we know
the general will if we fell over

00:04:39.983 --> 00:04:40.350
it?
 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.565
And it's often been the case
that people have tended to

00:04:46.565 --> 00:04:53.242
associate the general will with
the idea of the will of the

00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:54.740
majority.
 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.281
But going all the way back to
the eighteenth century there has

00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:05.459
been the contrarian impulse
first noticed by a philosopher

00:05:05.459 --> 00:05:10.819
called Condorcet at the end of
the eighteenth century,

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.920
but that has since preoccupied
many theorists of democracy,

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.384
and that is that,
well, actually majority rule

00:05:20.384 --> 00:05:26.339
doesn't even necessarily reflect
the will of the majority.

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:30.983
What Condorcet noticed was a
very simple fact which is

00:05:30.983 --> 00:05:36.504
suppose you have a society where
there are three voters and each

00:05:36.504 --> 00:05:41.500
voter has a preference over
three different policies.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:47.230
So in this example voter number
one prefers A to B and B to C.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:53.353
Voter number two prefers C to A
and A to B, and number three

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.259
prefers B to C and C to A.
 

00:05:56.259 --> 00:06:03.194
What Condorcet noticed was you
get a paradoxical result because

00:06:03.194 --> 00:06:07.110
you have a majority for A over
B.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:14.254
You have a majority for B over
C, but then you have a majority

00:06:14.254 --> 00:06:18.519
for C over A,
and that seems like a

00:06:18.519 --> 00:06:25.232
contradiction because if you
dial back through your notes to

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:32.060
when we were discussing basic
properties of rationality,

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.649
remember when we were talking
about indifference curves and

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:35.607
all of that,
this seems to violate the

00:06:35.607 --> 00:06:39.074
principle of transitivity
because you have a majority for

00:06:39.074 --> 00:06:42.797
A over B,
you have a majority for B over

00:06:42.797 --> 00:06:47.269
C, and then you have a majority
for C over A.

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:52.180
So it seems like our individual
preferences can be rational our

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.853
collective preferences might be
irrational in the sense that

00:06:56.853 --> 00:06:59.310
they contradict themselves.
 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:05.189
And so several things follow
from this, or are thought to

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:08.129
follow from this at least.
 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.149
One is that,
this Condorcet noticed in the

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:13.810
eighteenth century,
but a famous,

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.370
indeed, Nobel Prize winning
economist called Kenneth Arrow

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.930
proved a theorem in 1951 in a
little book called Social

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:28.050
Choice and Individual Values
that this is a perfectly general

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:29.170
result.
 

00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:34.045
And so if you have modest
pluralism of preferences which

00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:37.728
we were assuming--
remember when we talked about

00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:41.875
crosscutting cleavages on Monday
we were assuming it's important

00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:44.526
for democracy,
diversity of tastes and

00:07:44.526 --> 00:07:48.281
preferences,
then you can always get this

00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:51.040
result with majority rule.
 

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.353
So that has a number of
unsettling implications because

00:07:56.353 --> 00:08:01.569
there's no general will
identified by the majority.

00:08:01.569 --> 00:08:04.699
On the contrary,
if things are put in one order

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:07.966
you'll get one result,
but if things are put in a

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:11.370
different order you'll get a
different result.

00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:16.021
So the way parliamentary
committees often work you have a

00:08:16.021 --> 00:08:20.339
motion and then you have
amendments to the motion.

00:08:20.339 --> 00:08:24.771
You always vote on the
amendments first and then the

00:08:24.771 --> 00:08:26.509
final motion last.
 

00:08:26.509 --> 00:08:32.193
So another important theorem
proved by somebody called Gerald

00:08:32.193 --> 00:08:37.500
Kramer about twenty years after
Arrow basically says,

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:42.090
"If you let me determine
the order of voting,

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:42.462
i.e.
 

00:08:42.462 --> 00:08:47.778
what the amendments are and
what order we'll vote on them,

00:08:47.778 --> 00:08:50.110
I can get any outcome.
 

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:54.149
All I have to do is know your
preferences and control the

00:08:54.149 --> 00:08:57.253
order of voting,
and I can get a majority to

00:08:57.253 --> 00:09:00.139
appear to support any
outcome."

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:05.210
So this suggests that majority
rule can be manipulated.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.280
Now you might say, "Well,
when millions of people are

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:14.618
voting nobody's really
controlling the agenda in that

00:09:14.618 --> 00:09:17.880
specific a sense,
and nobody has all of that

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.440
information about everybody's
preferences,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.480
so people can't manipulate the
outcome."

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.764
That might be true as well,
but it also suggests that there

00:09:27.764 --> 00:09:31.385
shouldn't be much moral
authority attaching to the

00:09:31.385 --> 00:09:36.732
outcome if we know--
yeah, nobody manipulated that C

00:09:36.732 --> 00:09:39.196
wins,
but if things had been done in

00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:41.240
a different order B might have
won,

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.200
or A might have won in this
circumstance,

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.211
so why should we attach any
particular moral authority to

00:09:49.211 --> 00:09:51.179
the idea that C won?
 

00:09:51.179 --> 00:09:52.509
We shouldn't.
 

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:55.288
It's just an arbitrary result.
 

00:09:55.288 --> 00:09:59.442
So footnote to this,
one important takeaway from

00:09:59.442 --> 00:10:04.480
Arrow's theorem is you should
always be the last person to

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.380
interview for a job,
because if there are cyclical

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:12.114
preferences among the interviews
over the candidates you want the

00:10:12.114 --> 00:10:15.554
others to bump each other off
and then you come along at the

00:10:15.554 --> 00:10:16.080
end.
 

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.850
So don't say you didn't learn
anything useful today.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.649
You certainly learned that.
 

00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:23.562
They call you for an interview
say, "Well,

00:10:23.562 --> 00:10:24.808
could I come in three weeks?
 

00:10:24.808 --> 00:10:27.210
Why don't you interview your
other candidates first?"

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:33.220
So majority rule.
 

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:36.730
If there is such a thing as the
general will,

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:40.240
majority rule doesn't seem to
identify it.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.774
And the public choice
literature that came out of

00:10:44.774 --> 00:10:50.347
economics in the 1950s and 1960s
basically converged on that

00:10:50.347 --> 00:10:51.860
proposition.
 

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.835
It said, "There is no such
thing as a social welfare

00:10:55.835 --> 00:10:58.886
function,"
which is just econ-speak for

00:10:58.886 --> 00:11:02.649
saying there is no such thing as
a general will,

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:08.019
or if there is a general will
we don't know what decision rule

00:11:08.019 --> 00:11:09.778
would identify it.
 

00:11:09.778 --> 00:11:15.923
And a huge amount of ink has
been spilt in trying to figure

00:11:15.923 --> 00:11:22.277
out what decision rule might
identify unambiguously something

00:11:22.277 --> 00:11:28.313
that we would feel morally
comfortable calling the general

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.480
will.
 

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:37.820
And I don't think anybody has
succeeded definitively at that

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.808
task.
 

00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:42.908
Locke, we always come back to
Locke in this course.

00:11:42.908 --> 00:11:47.440
Locke has a somewhat different
defense of majority rule.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.534
Now you might think that's
weird because most people think

00:11:52.534 --> 00:11:56.379
of Locke as somebody who
defended rights.

00:11:56.379 --> 00:12:00.803
If you go and read about the
debates on The Constitution the

00:12:00.803 --> 00:12:05.308
Lockeans versus the Republicans,
those of you who have taken the

00:12:05.308 --> 00:12:07.798
history course,
the Lockeans were the people

00:12:07.798 --> 00:12:09.990
who wanted to create the Bill of
Rights,

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.509
defend against the majority and
so on,

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:18.543
but in fact if you go and read
Locke what you find is that he's

00:12:18.543 --> 00:12:21.629
a staunch defender of majority
rule.

00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:24.019
He says, "For when any
number of Men have,

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:26.240
by the consent of every
individual,

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.692
made a Community,
they have thereby made that

00:12:29.692 --> 00:12:33.303
Community one Body,
with a Power to Act as one

00:12:33.303 --> 00:12:37.285
Body, which is only by the will
and determination of the

00:12:37.285 --> 00:12:38.590
majority."
 

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.759
It doesn't say why.
 

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:45.870
"For that which acts any
Community,

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:49.240
being only the consent of the
individuals of it,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:53.160
and it being necessary to that
which is one body to move one

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.936
way;
it is necessary the Body should

00:12:55.936 --> 00:13:00.000
move that way whither the
greater force carries it,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.625
which is the consent of the
majority: or else it is

00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:09.159
impossible it should act or
continue one Body,

00:13:09.159 --> 00:13:13.923
one Community[.]"
So he's saying it's necessary

00:13:13.923 --> 00:13:17.341
the body should move that way
whither the greater force

00:13:17.341 --> 00:13:20.442
carries it,
which is the consent of the

00:13:20.442 --> 00:13:23.004
majority,
or else it's impossible it

00:13:23.004 --> 00:13:26.308
should continue to act one body
or one community,

00:13:26.308 --> 00:13:29.544
which the consent of every
individual that's united into it

00:13:29.544 --> 00:13:33.010
agreed that it should,
and so everyone is bound by

00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:36.538
that consent to be concluded by
the majority.

00:13:36.538 --> 00:13:41.394
"And therefore we see that
in Assemblies impowered to act

00:13:41.394 --> 00:13:46.090
by positive Laws where no number
is set by that positive Law

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:49.842
which impowers them,
the act of the Majority passes

00:13:49.842 --> 00:13:53.957
for the act of the whole,
and of course determines,

00:13:53.957 --> 00:13:58.409
as having by the Law of Nature
and Reason,

00:13:58.409 --> 00:14:01.538
the power of the whole."
 

00:14:01.538 --> 00:14:03.870
So that's Locke's defense of
majority rule.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:07.230
It's not that it identifies
some general will.

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.918
It's really an argument about
power, right?

00:14:10.918 --> 00:14:14.553
He's basically saying,
"Look, once you have a

00:14:14.553 --> 00:14:17.668
community somebody's going to
win."

00:14:17.668 --> 00:14:20.000
It's a little bit like Nozick
saying,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.594
"Once you have those
independents out there

00:14:23.594 --> 00:14:26.958
somebody's going to force them
to join,"

00:14:26.958 --> 00:14:31.471
just a realpolitik argument
that the power of the majority's

00:14:31.471 --> 00:14:35.220
going to determine what the
community does.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.787
And indeed, if we delve more
deeply into other things that

00:14:38.787 --> 00:14:42.145
Locke says he basically says,
"Look, if you don't like

00:14:42.145 --> 00:14:44.916
what the government does,
you can oppose,

00:14:44.916 --> 00:14:49.365
but if nobody agrees with you,
you should (as we discussed

00:14:49.365 --> 00:14:52.274
earlier in the course),
you should expect your reward

00:14:52.274 --> 00:14:53.370
in the next life.
 

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.159
If everybody agrees,
or if a majority agrees with

00:14:57.159 --> 00:14:59.450
you then you can have 1688.
 

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:02.610
You can change the
government."

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:08.408
So this seems to be an argument
about the legitimacy of the

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:13.509
majority that is a very
hardnosed realistic judgment

00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:17.434
about politics,
not a moral claim that the

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:21.806
majority has any particular
intrinsic property that gives it

00:15:21.806 --> 00:15:23.509
the right to govern.
 

00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:28.879
It's just saying,
"Well, there it is.

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:33.860
The majority is going to flex
its muscles and if it's not

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.240
attended to it's going to
win."

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:42.798
 
 

00:15:42.798 --> 00:15:46.230
Now I think that we will see
Locke gets,

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:50.380
actually, a lot closer to the
truth of the desirability of

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.970
majority rule than Rousseau did
or the people who were trying to

00:15:54.970 --> 00:15:58.538
come up with the notion of the
general will,

00:15:58.538 --> 00:16:03.639
or what modern economists would
call a social welfare function.

00:16:03.639 --> 00:16:07.288
And a way you could think about
this argument,

00:16:07.288 --> 00:16:10.817
particularly in light of the
observation about the

00:16:10.817 --> 00:16:14.918
relationship between majority
rule and utilitarianism,

00:16:14.918 --> 00:16:19.066
is that I think the best way to
think of what Locke is doing

00:16:19.066 --> 00:16:22.370
here it's a kind of negative
utilitarianism,

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:25.970
or at least a cousin of
negative utilitarianism.

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.778
We generally think of negative
utilitarianism as the doctrine

00:16:30.778 --> 00:16:34.784
that we should minimize pain as
opposed to positive

00:16:34.784 --> 00:16:39.610
utilitarianism which is,
maximize pleasure.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.643
We didn't make that distinction
when we talked about Bentham,

00:16:43.643 --> 00:16:46.870
but it's there in the
contemporary literature.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.692
So this is a cousin,
I think, of negative

00:16:50.692 --> 00:16:56.426
utilitarianism in the sense that
I think that Locke thinks of

00:16:56.426 --> 00:17:01.969
majority rule and indeed of
resistance to power as a way of

00:17:01.969 --> 00:17:06.269
limiting the possibility of
domination.

00:17:06.269 --> 00:17:10.180
Limiting the possibility of
domination.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:15.626
And he's saying you can resist
power if power's dominating you,

00:17:15.626 --> 00:17:20.372
but you're only going to win if
you're in the majority,

00:17:20.372 --> 00:17:23.358
if you have the greater force.
 

00:17:23.358 --> 00:17:30.596
But why is majority rule the
instrument for limiting the

00:17:30.596 --> 00:17:34.279
possibility of domination?
 

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:39.180
Why should we think of majority
rule as having that propensity?

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.680
 
 

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.750
Anyone got a suggestion?
 

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.612
Why should we think that
majority rule,

00:17:49.612 --> 00:17:53.529
all things considered,
would limit the possibility of

00:17:53.529 --> 00:17:54.660
domination?
 

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:56.440
This is a hard question.
 

00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.460
Yeah?
 

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.294
Student:  Well,
it seems it would go back to

00:18:03.294 --> 00:18:05.680
the crosscutting cleavages that
we talked about the other day,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.919
that if you're going to be in
the majority you don't know if

00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:11.993
you're going to be in the
minority on other things so you

00:18:11.993 --> 00:18:14.630
would limit the domination that
you put out.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.269
You wouldn't want to be a
domineering presence for fear

00:18:17.269 --> 00:18:19.762
that there'd be other
domineering presences in other

00:18:19.762 --> 00:18:20.348
spheres.
 

00:18:20.348 --> 00:18:21.900
Prof: I think that's
exactly right.

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.670
I think you've hit the nail on
the head.

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.363
He said, "Well,
it's related to the

00:18:27.363 --> 00:18:33.234
crosscutting cleavages and one's
not knowing whether or not the

00:18:33.234 --> 00:18:39.012
policies that get enacted are
going to be the polices that you

00:18:39.012 --> 00:18:41.836
want,
or whether you're going to

00:18:41.836 --> 00:18:45.858
regard them as being imposed on
you and dominating you."

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:50.368
I'll come back to your point in
a minute,

00:18:50.368 --> 00:18:52.808
but as background to it and to
show,

00:18:52.808 --> 00:18:57.167
I think, exactly why you're
right and what turns on what you

00:18:57.167 --> 00:18:59.423
said,
think about another

00:18:59.423 --> 00:19:04.500
prize-winning economist who has
theorized about politics.

00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:09.207
This is a book published in
1962 by the economist James

00:19:09.207 --> 00:19:13.914
Buchanan and the political
scientist Gordon Tullock for

00:19:13.914 --> 00:19:18.884
which Buchanan got the Nobel
Prize in 1986 and Tullock was

00:19:18.884 --> 00:19:20.278
not happy.
 

00:19:20.278 --> 00:19:24.548
The argument was,
"Well, we don't have any

00:19:24.548 --> 00:19:28.169
Nobel Prize for political
science,"

00:19:28.169 --> 00:19:32.160
so that's why they gave it to
Buchanan.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.680
Although you may know that last
year,

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:38.588
in a slap at their own
discipline, in fact for the

00:19:38.588 --> 00:19:42.896
first time the Nobel Prize
Committee did give the Nobel

00:19:42.896 --> 00:19:47.921
Prize to a political scientist,
a woman by the name of Elinor

00:19:47.921 --> 00:19:50.740
Ostrom at the University of
Indiana,

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:52.808
but that was then and this is
now.

00:19:52.808 --> 00:19:57.969
In 1986 Buchanan got the
recognition and Tullock was not

00:19:57.969 --> 00:20:01.440
happy as he widely let it be
known.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.430
So here's the intuition.
 

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:10.420
It is behind a veil of
ignorance.

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:13.578
This book interestingly a long
time before Rawls wrote,

00:20:13.578 --> 00:20:17.519
1962, but the basic idea is
behind the veil of ignorance,

00:20:17.519 --> 00:20:23.707
how would you think about the
decision rules that should

00:20:23.707 --> 00:20:25.170
govern you?
 

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.400
How can you reason about that?
 

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:32.170
And they said,
"Well, what you have to

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.348
think about is two things.
 

00:20:35.348 --> 00:20:42.260
One is, how likely is it that
the society is going to do

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:48.545
something you don't like,
and what can you do about

00:20:48.545 --> 00:20:50.430
that?"
 

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:54.490
And related to that,
you have to think how much do

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:59.627
you care, because some decisions
are much more important to you

00:20:59.627 --> 00:21:01.700
than other decisions.
 

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.096
Why does it matter how much you
care, because being involved in

00:21:06.096 --> 00:21:10.281
decision-making takes up time,
effort, energy that you could

00:21:10.281 --> 00:21:12.338
spend doing other things.
 

00:21:12.338 --> 00:21:15.535
So if it's some utterly trivial
decision you're not going to

00:21:15.535 --> 00:21:17.538
want to spend a lot of time on
it,

00:21:17.538 --> 00:21:21.878
but if it's a really important
decision then you'll be willing

00:21:21.878 --> 00:21:25.863
to spend time on it in order to
make sure your rights are

00:21:25.863 --> 00:21:26.858
protected.
 

00:21:26.858 --> 00:21:31.019
So they make a distinction
between,

00:21:31.019 --> 00:21:34.029
first of all,
what they call external costs,

00:21:34.029 --> 00:21:42.257
and the idea here is that as
the number of people in the

00:21:42.257 --> 00:21:48.732
society goes up,
the chances that you're going

00:21:48.732 --> 00:21:56.251
to have some decision imposed on
you that you don't like also

00:21:56.251 --> 00:22:03.644
goes up because there are all
kinds of decisions that people

00:22:03.644 --> 00:22:05.650
could make.
 

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:10.108
On the other hand there are
decision making costs too,

00:22:10.108 --> 00:22:13.939
and as the number of people in
the society goes up the decision

00:22:13.939 --> 00:22:17.707
making costs increase as well
because there are more people to

00:22:17.707 --> 00:22:20.960
talk to,
to negotiate with and so on.

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:26.249
And so what you have to think
about is the sum of those two

00:22:26.249 --> 00:22:27.069
things.
 

00:22:27.069 --> 00:22:33.588
How important is it to you?
 

00:22:33.588 --> 00:22:36.900
How important is it to you to
participate in decision-making

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:41.578
is going to be,
how much do you care about the

00:22:41.578 --> 00:22:44.102
result,
and how much time are you going

00:22:44.102 --> 00:22:45.568
to have to spend on the result.
 

00:22:45.568 --> 00:22:50.130
And what they said in a kind of
utilitarian calculus they said,

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:54.007
"What you're going to want
to do is add them up,"

00:22:54.007 --> 00:22:57.884
so you're going to want to
minimize the sum of the external

00:22:57.884 --> 00:23:00.558
costs and the decision-making
costs.

00:23:00.558 --> 00:23:06.858
You're going to want to
minimize that.

00:23:06.858 --> 00:23:11.848
So when a decision is
completely unimportant to you

00:23:11.848 --> 00:23:16.440
then you won't want to spend a
lot of time,

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.390
but when a decision is really
important to you,

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:22.828
you will be willing to spend
time.

00:23:22.828 --> 00:23:26.318
And so then they said,
"Well, so how should we

00:23:26.318 --> 00:23:29.670
think about the organization of
society?"

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:34.863
For questions that people think
are really important we should

00:23:34.863 --> 00:23:38.438
have something like unanimity
rule because,

00:23:38.438 --> 00:23:42.440
after all, unanimity rule is a
veto of one.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:47.480
If you have unanimity rule it's
like the Pareto principle.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.380
Anybody can veto.
 

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:54.788
Everybody's agreement has to be
gotten in the limiting case.

00:23:54.788 --> 00:24:00.359
If you had absolute unanimity
rule you can't do anything

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:01.880
without that.
 

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.970
Whereas for less important
decisions,

00:24:05.970 --> 00:24:12.506
this point here when you're
minimizing the sum of external

00:24:12.506 --> 00:24:19.558
costs and decision-making costs,
what would be something less

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:21.838
than unanimity rule?
 

00:24:21.838 --> 00:24:25.776
It might be a two-thirds rule,
and even less important things

00:24:25.776 --> 00:24:29.491
you might say majority rule,
and even less important things

00:24:29.491 --> 00:24:31.888
than you might say,
"Let the bureaucrats

00:24:31.888 --> 00:24:32.278
decide.
 

00:24:32.278 --> 00:24:36.180
It's just not worth my
time."

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:41.325
So for Buchanan and Tullock,
there's no presumption that

00:24:41.325 --> 00:24:46.376
there's any particular
importance attaching to majority

00:24:46.376 --> 00:24:47.220
rule.
 

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:50.611
On the contrary,
we should say for the most

00:24:50.611 --> 00:24:55.696
important things we should start
with unanimity rule and then we

00:24:55.696 --> 00:25:00.057
can come down the ladder or we
can think about steadily

00:25:00.057 --> 00:25:04.820
declining supermajorities as
things become less important to

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.710
us.
 

00:25:05.710 --> 00:25:10.907
And so the argument was that
for constitutional questions it

00:25:10.907 --> 00:25:15.490
should be something very close
to unanimity rule,

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:19.385
and we should have entrenched
or semi-entrenched clauses that

00:25:19.385 --> 00:25:21.788
are virtually impossible to
change.

00:25:21.788 --> 00:25:25.772
They're telling a story that
more or less reflects the

00:25:25.772 --> 00:25:28.930
structure of the American
Constitution,

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:33.863
where amending the Constitution
does take very hard to get super

00:25:33.863 --> 00:25:37.787
majorities,
but regular legislation takes a

00:25:37.787 --> 00:25:38.700
lot less.
 

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.116
And it's simply this
calculation, this

00:25:42.116 --> 00:25:48.028
self-interested calculation that
leads you to often be willing to

00:25:48.028 --> 00:25:53.200
go with majority rule and
there's nothing more to be said

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.509
about it than that.
 

00:25:55.509 --> 00:25:58.839
So now we come to your
observation, and your

00:25:58.839 --> 00:26:03.255
observation is basically the
observation that Buchanan and

00:26:03.255 --> 00:26:07.596
Tullock are wrong;
that Buchanan and Tullock are

00:26:07.596 --> 00:26:12.779
wrong because they confuse
unanimity as a state of affairs

00:26:12.779 --> 00:26:18.327
in the world where we all agree
about something with unanimity

00:26:18.327 --> 00:26:20.509
as a decision rule.
 

00:26:20.509 --> 00:26:24.650
And your observation was first
made by Brian Barry,

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:28.188
who sadly died last year,
in a very good book called

00:26:28.188 --> 00:26:32.490
Political Argument and
was developed by Douglas Rae,

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:36.429
who teaches here in SOM,
in two important articles in

00:26:36.429 --> 00:26:39.990
the American Political
Science Review.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:43.513
And what Barry and Rae pointed
out was exactly what this

00:26:43.513 --> 00:26:46.588
gentleman here pointed out a few
minutes ago,

00:26:46.588 --> 00:26:53.442
which is the whole Buchanan and
Tullock story assumes we have

00:26:53.442 --> 00:26:56.640
agreement at the baseline.
 

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.834
The whole Buchanan and Tullock
story assumes that everybody's

00:27:01.834 --> 00:27:05.470
happy with the initial state of
affairs.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:08.278
And so then we say,
"Well so."

00:27:08.278 --> 00:27:11.509
We started at that baseline and
then we say,

00:27:11.509 --> 00:27:15.906
"The things that are most
important to you from that

00:27:15.906 --> 00:27:20.068
baseline we'll create unanimity
rule and give you,

00:27:20.068 --> 00:27:24.140
everyone in the room,
essentially a veto,

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:27.240
but then we'll work down from
that."

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:32.930
But what Rae and Barry said
was, "Well,

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:37.530
what if we say that behind this
veil of ignorance we don't know

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:41.390
whether we're going to like the
status quo or not.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:44.298
Maybe we will,
maybe we won't,

00:27:44.298 --> 00:27:50.416
but if you don't want to give
any special status to the status

00:27:50.416 --> 00:27:53.767
quo,
then you shouldn't bias

00:27:53.767 --> 00:27:59.295
decisions to the status quo,
because maybe it'll turn out

00:27:59.295 --> 00:28:04.298
that you don't want the status
quo and then you're stuck with

00:28:04.298 --> 00:28:08.220
something that's impossible to
change."

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:12.910
And so what Barry and Rae
showed was,

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:17.309
well, actually if you assume
behind a veil of ignorance that

00:28:17.309 --> 00:28:21.710
you're as likely to be against
the status quo as in favor of

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.587
the status quo then you would
choose majority rule or

00:28:25.587 --> 00:28:28.048
something very close to it.
 

00:28:28.048 --> 00:28:31.911
So if the number of people in
the society is even you would

00:28:31.911 --> 00:28:35.440
choose N over two plus one or N
over two minus one.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.807
If you were wanting to minimize
the probably that a decision's

00:28:39.807 --> 00:28:44.670
going to be imposed upon you,
not knowing whether or not it

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:48.568
was the decision favored by the
status quo.

00:28:48.568 --> 00:28:53.434
So there's a kind of veil of
ignorance logic in the Rae and

00:28:53.434 --> 00:28:58.215
Barry critique of Buchanan and
Tullock which says that the

00:28:58.215 --> 00:29:03.164
presumption should be in favor
of majority rule or something

00:29:03.164 --> 00:29:08.365
very close to it unless we want
to bias the whole system toward

00:29:08.365 --> 00:29:13.215
the status quo,
and we don't actually have any

00:29:13.215 --> 00:29:16.808
ultimate good reason for doing
that,

00:29:16.808 --> 00:29:21.656
because even if somebody at
some constitutional convention

00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:25.058
preferred to entrench whatever
it is,

00:29:25.058 --> 00:29:27.903
the right the bear arms two
hundred years later we might not

00:29:27.903 --> 00:29:30.170
take the view that we want to
entrench that,

00:29:30.170 --> 00:29:35.259
but now it becomes impossibly
hard to change.

00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:39.637
So if you say behind the veil
of ignorance we're going to be

00:29:39.637 --> 00:29:43.792
as likely to oppose as to
support there does seem to be a

00:29:43.792 --> 00:29:48.022
kind of negative utilitarian
logic which says if I want to

00:29:48.022 --> 00:29:52.104
minimize the likelihood of
having decisions I don't like

00:29:52.104 --> 00:29:57.477
imposed upon me,
I would prefer majority rule to

00:29:57.477 --> 00:30:00.200
the going alternatives.
 

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:04.099
Well, that's all very well,
and I think that the Barry and

00:30:04.099 --> 00:30:06.288
Rae argument is pretty robust.
 

00:30:06.288 --> 00:30:08.250
It's certainly stood up for
what now;

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.578
close to half a century.
 

00:30:10.578 --> 00:30:13.880
It's regarded as conventional
wisdom on this point.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:19.221
Still in all it doesn't tell us
a lot about the dynamics of

00:30:19.221 --> 00:30:20.880
actual politics.
 

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.238
How does competitive democracy
play out when we're thinking

00:30:26.238 --> 00:30:31.041
about how actual political
systems, actual democratic

00:30:31.041 --> 00:30:32.890
systems operate?
 

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.753
And you'll recall that from
Monday's lecture I said to you

00:30:36.753 --> 00:30:40.890
that Robert Dahl was the most
important democratic theorist of

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:44.009
the second half of the twentieth
century,

00:30:44.009 --> 00:30:47.029
but I didn't talk about the
first half of the twentieth

00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.588
century.
 

00:30:47.588 --> 00:30:51.518
And I think the most important
democratic theorist of the first

00:30:51.518 --> 00:30:55.778
half of the twentieth century,
who in many ways Dahl built

00:30:55.778 --> 00:30:59.954
upon, was actually an economist
by the name of Joseph

00:30:59.954 --> 00:31:01.078
Schumpeter.
 

00:31:01.078 --> 00:31:04.682
Economists had a lot of
influence in democratic theory

00:31:04.682 --> 00:31:06.519
in the twentieth century.
 

00:31:06.519 --> 00:31:10.325
Schumpeter wrote a book called
Capitalism,

00:31:10.325 --> 00:31:14.994
Socialism and Democracy
which he published in 1942,

00:31:14.994 --> 00:31:17.848
eight years before his death.
 

00:31:17.848 --> 00:31:22.535
And most of that book is
actually completely

00:31:22.535 --> 00:31:24.170
unremarkable.
 

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.923
Most of that book is a long and
rather tortured critique of Carl

00:31:27.923 --> 00:31:30.282
Marx,
but the piece of it we're

00:31:30.282 --> 00:31:35.105
focusing on are those two little
chapters called The Classical

00:31:35.105 --> 00:31:38.647
Theory of Democracy and
Another Theory of

00:31:38.647 --> 00:31:40.078
Democracy.
 

00:31:40.078 --> 00:31:45.496
And I should say that those two
little chapters may be the most

00:31:45.496 --> 00:31:50.563
influential writings about
democracy in the real world that

00:31:50.563 --> 00:31:54.318
have come out of the twentieth
century.

00:31:54.318 --> 00:31:59.818
Now it should also be said just
as a prefatory matter that the

00:31:59.818 --> 00:32:04.326
title of the first chapter of
those two chapters is

00:32:04.326 --> 00:32:07.357
misleading,
because what he calls the

00:32:07.357 --> 00:32:11.490
classical theory of democracy is
actually a neoclassical theory.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:14.858
It is Rousseau's idea of the
general will,

00:32:14.858 --> 00:32:19.250
which we now know to be
chimerical,

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:23.112
but you know from Monday's
lecture that Rousseau's idea of

00:32:23.112 --> 00:32:27.108
the general will was actually a
neoclassical adaptation,

00:32:27.108 --> 00:32:32.615
because the ancient Greek idea
was ruling and being ruled in

00:32:32.615 --> 00:32:33.269
turn.
 

00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:37.700
So Schumpeter's critique of
what he calls the classical

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:41.884
theory of democracy we should
remember as actually a

00:32:41.884 --> 00:32:45.250
neoclassical eighteenth-century
idea.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:50.230
But he starts from the
proposition that the critique of

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.920
the idea of the general will is
valid.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.990
There is no such thing.
 

00:32:54.990 --> 00:33:00.300
There is no social welfare
function, as an economist would

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.140
put it.
 

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:04.861
But he, Schumpeter,
says, "Let's think about

00:33:04.861 --> 00:33:08.349
democracy in a fundamentally
different way.

00:33:08.349 --> 00:33:11.548
Let's define it as follows.
 

00:33:11.548 --> 00:33:16.157
'The democratic method is that
institutional arrangement for

00:33:16.157 --> 00:33:21.079
arriving at political decisions
in which individuals acquire the

00:33:21.079 --> 00:33:25.531
power to decide by means of a
competitive struggle for the

00:33:25.531 --> 00:33:27.720
people's vote.'"
 

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:32.720
 
 

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:38.317
And now he's going to develop
this idea in that second little

00:33:38.317 --> 00:33:42.049
chapter with an analogy to the
market.

00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:47.500
 
 

00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.349
He's going to think about
democracy as shopping.

00:33:51.349 --> 00:33:58.000
 
 

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.179
Schumpeter says,
"Look, think about

00:34:02.179 --> 00:34:07.750
democracy, think about the
polity as an analog of the

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.679
economy."
 

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:14.775
What do we have in the economy,
and what do we have in the

00:34:14.775 --> 00:34:15.579
polity?
 

00:34:15.579 --> 00:34:21.266
Well, one thing we have in the
economy is consumers,

00:34:21.266 --> 00:34:26.619
and what is the political
analog of consumers?

00:34:26.619 --> 00:34:28.039
Any guesses?
 

00:34:28.039 --> 00:34:30.539
What's the political analog of
consumers?

00:34:30.539 --> 00:34:39.329
 
 

00:34:39.329 --> 00:34:40.969
Student: Voters.
 

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:42.815
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Yeah, voters.

00:34:42.815 --> 00:34:45.349
Another thing we have in the
economy is firms.

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:49.590
What's the political analog of
firms?

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.000
Anybody?
 

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.570
You have the mic, guess.
 

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:54.880
Student: Various candidates for
positions?

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.119
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Yeah, parties.

00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:57.599
That's good enough.
 

00:34:57.599 --> 00:35:00.099
Firms make profits.
 

00:35:00.099 --> 00:35:03.829
What is the political analog of
profits?

00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:07.449
Student: Whoever wins the
election?

00:35:07.449 --> 00:35:08.340
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Close.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:08.880
What do they get?
 

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.389
How do they win?
 

00:35:09.389 --> 00:35:10.280
Student: They get votes.
 

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.559
Professor Ian Shapiro: Exactly.
 

00:35:11.559 --> 00:35:14.590
So firms want profits,
parties want votes.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:17.570
Then firms produce products.
 

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:20.570
What is produced in the polity?
 

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.559
Student: Various party
platforms.

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:24.527
Professor Ian Shapiro:
Platforms, yeah and

00:35:24.527 --> 00:35:25.199
legislation.
 

00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:29.463
And so when we think of the
doctrine of consumer sovereignty

00:35:29.463 --> 00:35:33.510
in economics what would the
political analog of it be?

00:35:33.510 --> 00:35:40.659
This won't leap out at you
immediately, but okay.

00:35:40.659 --> 00:35:42.840
It's the idea of democratic
legitimacy;

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.800
it's the equivalent.
 

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.210
When we say this consumer
sovereignty in markets there's

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:52.260
democratic legitimacy in the
polity.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:57.364
And so we have this basic
parallel between the economic

00:35:57.364 --> 00:36:00.768
system where firms are
competing,

00:36:00.768 --> 00:36:05.684
firms are competing for
profits, and they engage in a

00:36:05.684 --> 00:36:10.409
competitive struggle for the
consumer's dollar,

00:36:10.409 --> 00:36:15.030
to paraphrase Schumpeter,
and parties are competing for

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.650
votes and they engage in a
competitive struggle for the

00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:21.190
people's vote.
 

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:24.989
And democracy is not about
participation,

00:36:24.989 --> 00:36:28.304
or deliberation,
or all of the things that

00:36:28.304 --> 00:36:31.909
people try to identify with,
it's essentially,

00:36:31.909 --> 00:36:33.980
as I said, it's about shopping.
 

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:40.927
You shop for politicians and
policies in just the same way as

00:36:40.927 --> 00:36:47.989
you shop for iPads and Maseratis
or whatever it is you buy.

00:36:47.989 --> 00:36:51.469
This is how we should think
about democracy.

00:36:51.469 --> 00:36:56.980
Hugely influential,
hugely influential.

00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:02.679
And what disciplines the
elites, what disciplines the

00:37:02.679 --> 00:37:08.050
elites that creates the
democratic legitimacy,

00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:11.650
or maybe I should have put
democratic accountability there,

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:18.090
is the fact that the voter can
kick the bums out.

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:22.340
Gordon Brown's worrying about
this for the next few weeks.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:29.110
The British voters can heave
him out.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.809
That is what disciplines the
political elites.

00:37:31.809 --> 00:37:36.922
That is what prevents them
ultimately from exercising

00:37:36.922 --> 00:37:38.199
domination.
 

00:37:38.199 --> 00:37:45.706
And so we think about a
competitive system driven by

00:37:45.706 --> 00:37:51.889
politicians who are competing
for votes.

00:37:51.889 --> 00:37:55.329
Turns out there's a big
tradition in American political

00:37:55.329 --> 00:37:58.260
science of studying this that
goes back to,

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.014
again, another economist,
kind of depressing all these

00:38:02.014 --> 00:38:04.070
economists but there it is.
 

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:10.331
In 1929 Hotelling,
who wrote a paper trying to

00:38:10.331 --> 00:38:17.010
explain why is it that if you
look at a town,

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:28.250
any town, you'll find Target
and you'll find--

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:29.690
what's another?
 

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:33.757
You'll find Shaw's and Stop
&amp; Shop right next to each

00:38:33.757 --> 00:38:35.429
other on Main Street.
 

00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:39.768
And Downs developed this into a
political argument.

00:38:39.768 --> 00:38:45.380
Basically he said imagine
you've got a continuum here from

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.532
left to right,
so the people with

00:38:48.532 --> 00:38:51.880
ideological--this is ideology.
 

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.260
People on the left are here.
 

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.889
People on the right are here.
 

00:38:54.889 --> 00:38:59.197
Well, we should think the
population is more or less

00:38:59.197 --> 00:39:03.081
normally distributed,
so most people are in the

00:39:03.081 --> 00:39:07.389
middle and some people are at
the two extremes.

00:39:07.389 --> 00:39:19.865
Well, if you have two political
parties where are they going to

00:39:19.865 --> 00:39:22.079
head for?
 

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:26.422
They're going to head for the
median voter because that's

00:39:26.422 --> 00:39:28.750
where most of the votes are.
 

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:34.144
So you might have differences
of opinion within the parties,

00:39:34.144 --> 00:39:39.175
I'll come back to that in a
minute, but basically--oops,

00:39:39.175 --> 00:39:40.730
where are we?
 

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.539
We're getting too far ahead of
ourselves here.

00:39:43.539 --> 00:39:54.250
 
 

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.036
Parties are going to head for
the median voter because that's

00:39:57.036 --> 00:39:58.059
where the votes are.
 

00:39:58.059 --> 00:40:02.818
When they asked whoever it was,
"Why did you rob

00:40:02.818 --> 00:40:04.099
banks?"
 

00:40:04.099 --> 00:40:05.380
Because that's where the money
is.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:11.630
Politicians are going to go for
the median voter.

00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:12.949
That's where the votes are.
 

00:40:12.949 --> 00:40:14.659
Now, of course,
they could be wrong.

00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:16.210
They're going to guess.
 

00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:22.369
So for example,
1964 Goldwater running for

00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:30.632
president thinks that the median
voter is way over here,

00:40:30.632 --> 00:40:35.289
but he's wrong so he loses.
 

00:40:35.289 --> 00:40:41.434
Then 1980 Ronald Regan
basically runs on exactly the

00:40:41.434 --> 00:40:48.784
same platform that Goldwater had
lost on in 1964 and everybody

00:40:48.784 --> 00:40:51.610
says,
"This crazy right-wing

00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:53.230
nut's going to be creamed.
 

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:56.934
We saw that in 1964,"
but either because he knew

00:40:56.934 --> 00:41:01.923
something,
or because he was lucky or some

00:41:01.923 --> 00:41:06.467
combination,
it turned out that between 1964

00:41:06.467 --> 00:41:11.795
and 1980 the median voter had
moved and Jimmy Carter was wrong

00:41:11.795 --> 00:41:14.940
about where the median voter
was.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:19.719
So generally speaking,
other things equal,

00:41:19.719 --> 00:41:22.980
the parties would converge to
the median voter,

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:29.079
or at least where they believed
the median voter is and the

00:41:29.079 --> 00:41:32.760
people who get it right will
win.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:37.324
Now that seems to have the
implication that particularly as

00:41:37.324 --> 00:41:42.342
polling gets better and better,
so you don't make the kind of

00:41:42.342 --> 00:41:47.271
mistakes the Democrats made in
1980 or the Republicans made in

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:51.139
1964,
the parties are going to start

00:41:51.139 --> 00:41:54.909
offering exactly the same
policies.

00:41:54.909 --> 00:41:57.779
And indeed, if you look at
the--I don't know how much

00:41:57.779 --> 00:42:00.980
attention you folks are paying
to the British election,

00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.360
but basically they're offering
the same policies.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.766
They're both saying the others
are going to lie to you about

00:42:07.766 --> 00:42:09.887
what they're going to do,
but we're going to keep the

00:42:09.887 --> 00:42:11.030
National Health Service.
 

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.840
We're not going to cut this.
 

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:13.659
We're not going to cut that.
 

00:42:13.659 --> 00:42:15.639
We're not going to do this to
taxes.

00:42:15.639 --> 00:42:18.659
Because they've done all the
polling they know what the

00:42:18.659 --> 00:42:21.065
median voter wants,
and so they're basically

00:42:21.065 --> 00:42:22.800
offering the same policies.
 

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:29.123
I'll come back to what that
means for political competition

00:42:29.123 --> 00:42:30.650
in a minute.
 

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:38.594
But if they're competing,
if they're basically offering

00:42:38.594 --> 00:42:45.949
the same policies,
what are they competing over?

00:42:45.949 --> 00:42:49.980
What are they putting in front
of electorate?

00:42:49.980 --> 00:43:00.480
 
 

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:03.311
If they're basically both doing
the same thing,

00:43:03.311 --> 00:43:06.391
they're going to compete over
things like character

00:43:06.391 --> 00:43:07.500
assassination.
 

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.480
They're going to say,
"He's a liar.

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.469
Vote for me because he's a liar.
 

00:43:10.469 --> 00:43:13.559
He says he won't cut the health
service but he will."

00:43:13.559 --> 00:43:16.010
The other one will say,
"He says we won't raise

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.019
taxes, but he will.
 

00:43:17.019 --> 00:43:18.710
He's dishonorable.
 

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.612
He was involved in this,
that, and the other

00:43:20.612 --> 00:43:21.320
scandal."
 

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.639
That's what they're going to do.
 

00:43:22.639 --> 00:43:25.380
They're going to compete over
personalities,

00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:25.889
right?
 

00:43:25.889 --> 00:43:31.302
Now one way you could imagine
something that would change that

00:43:31.302 --> 00:43:37.070
is if there were other variables
that kept these parties apart.

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:39.929
So, for example,
we have primaries now in the

00:43:39.929 --> 00:43:42.322
U.S.,
and of course the primary

00:43:42.322 --> 00:43:46.891
voters on the Democratic Party
are over here probably normally

00:43:46.891 --> 00:43:50.389
distributed,
and the primary voters in the

00:43:50.389 --> 00:43:52.530
Republican Party are here.
 

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:56.250
If you have to win the primary
first then you're going to get

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:59.311
pulled down here,
and the Republicans are going

00:43:59.311 --> 00:44:03.389
to get pulled over there,
and so what happens is if you

00:44:03.389 --> 00:44:07.739
have some other force that pulls
the parties apart,

00:44:07.739 --> 00:44:12.550
then you might get competition
over policy.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:17.012
Some people say, "Oh,
it's bad to have primaries

00:44:17.012 --> 00:44:21.943
because if you have primaries
the activists get control of the

00:44:21.943 --> 00:44:25.420
parties and extremists in both
parties,

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:29.190
you know, the unions control
what the Democratic Party does

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:33.480
and the far right controls what
the Republican Party does."

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:38.659
It's true, but the flipside of
that is that when the general

00:44:38.659 --> 00:44:42.275
election comes,
you actually have competition

00:44:42.275 --> 00:44:46.137
over policies because the
parties have been pulled apart

00:44:46.137 --> 00:44:50.210
by the fact that they had to win
these primaries first.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.369
Now there are other bad sides
of primaries,

00:44:53.369 --> 00:44:57.884
but part of the point here is
you need to see that what it is

00:44:57.884 --> 00:45:00.969
that parties compete over can
change.

00:45:00.969 --> 00:45:04.978
So when we put in the general
election the parties have been

00:45:04.978 --> 00:45:06.610
pulled somewhat apart.
 

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:12.699
So if you have something in the
structure of political parties,

00:45:12.699 --> 00:45:16.329
it could be primaries,
it could be a strong control of

00:45:16.329 --> 00:45:20.574
the party selection process by
the leadership or something like

00:45:20.574 --> 00:45:24.014
that,
then you will get competition

00:45:24.014 --> 00:45:25.250
over policy.
 

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:28.958
Now some people would say
that's better because people get

00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:32.862
a clear choice as opposed to
just character assassination and

00:45:32.862 --> 00:45:34.360
that sort of thing.
 

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:37.579
It's actually better for them
to compete over policies.

00:45:37.579 --> 00:45:41.181
Notice, though,
if you do have strong parties

00:45:41.181 --> 00:45:44.210
that are kept ideologically
apart,

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.760
and you have competition over
policy,

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.909
you can get results like in
Britain,

00:45:50.909 --> 00:45:54.943
the British Railways have been
nationalized and denationalized

00:45:54.943 --> 00:45:57.590
three times in the twentieth
century,

00:45:57.590 --> 00:46:00.909
because Labor comes in and
nationalizes them and then the

00:46:00.909 --> 00:46:03.340
Tories come in and
denationalizes them.

00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:07.577
So you get policy alternation
and that could be good or bad,

00:46:07.577 --> 00:46:10.809
but it's a different thing to
compete over.

00:46:10.809 --> 00:46:15.829
So you can have competition
over personalities,

00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:18.139
you can have competition over
policies,

00:46:18.139 --> 00:46:21.570
and of course you can have,
as we do in our system,

00:46:21.570 --> 00:46:26.579
you can have competition over
pork.

00:46:26.579 --> 00:46:30.463
If you have a system in which
you have individual

00:46:30.463 --> 00:46:33.780
constituencies like we do in the
U.S.,

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:36.242
you have congressional
constituencies and then you have

00:46:36.242 --> 00:46:39.228
states,
each representative is really

00:46:39.228 --> 00:46:42.529
looking for,
not the national median voter,

00:46:42.529 --> 00:46:46.550
but the median voter in their
district or in their state.

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.780
That's who they're serving.
 

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.416
And so there's a lot of
literature about whether it's

00:46:52.416 --> 00:46:56.331
better to have proportional
representation where you have

00:46:56.331 --> 00:46:59.199
basically one national
constituency,

00:46:59.199 --> 00:47:03.610
or whether you should have a
system in which politicians

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:08.423
compete with one another as to
who's going to bring more pork

00:47:08.423 --> 00:47:10.429
back to our district.
 

00:47:10.429 --> 00:47:15.606
So I mention these things only
so that you're aware that once

00:47:15.606 --> 00:47:20.181
we talk about political
competition we haven't settled

00:47:20.181 --> 00:47:23.719
what it is that parties compete
over.

00:47:23.719 --> 00:47:27.661
But Schumpeter didn't address
these because Schumpeter

00:47:27.661 --> 00:47:29.518
ultimately didn't care.
 

00:47:29.518 --> 00:47:32.072
He didn't care,
really, whether they were

00:47:32.072 --> 00:47:35.199
competing over personalities,
policies or pork.

00:47:35.199 --> 00:47:39.429
The point was that they were
competing, and they wanted to

00:47:39.429 --> 00:47:41.210
throw one another out.
 

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:45.905
This is the system,
to hearken back to Monday's

00:47:45.905 --> 00:47:49.393
lecture,
in which ambition really

00:47:49.393 --> 00:47:53.710
counteracts ambition,
whereas separation of powers

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:56.474
and all that,
for the reasons Dahl gave,

00:47:56.474 --> 00:47:57.820
doesn't really work.
 

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:01.847
There's no mechanism,
but this creates a mechanism

00:48:01.847 --> 00:48:04.969
for ambition to counteract
ambition.

00:48:04.969 --> 00:48:09.297
So Schumpeter and Dahl are much
more sympathetic to the idea of

00:48:09.297 --> 00:48:12.090
pluralism and crosscutting
cleavages,

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:16.797
and a competitive struggle for
the people's vote than they are

00:48:16.797 --> 00:48:21.429
to institutional checks and
balances to discipline elites.

00:48:21.429 --> 00:48:25.018
Of course there are problems
with Schumpeter.

00:48:25.018 --> 00:48:29.534
I'll just mention them briefly
because we're running short of

00:48:29.534 --> 00:48:32.768
time, and you can pursue them in
section.

00:48:32.768 --> 00:48:36.043
But one is, you're going to
have two parties,

00:48:36.043 --> 00:48:39.170
or maybe three parties,
or four parties;

00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:41.280
it's oligopolistic competition.
 

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:45.512
It's not a very thoroughgoing
form of competition,

00:48:45.512 --> 00:48:48.710
so that's one thing to think
about.

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:53.682
Secondly, this whole thing
doesn't address the role of

00:48:53.682 --> 00:48:55.559
money in politics.
 

00:48:55.559 --> 00:49:00.554
We'll see this in sharp relief
in the state of Connecticut in

00:49:00.554 --> 00:49:05.547
the next eight months where the
likely Republican nominee for

00:49:05.547 --> 00:49:10.541
Chris Dodd's Senate seat has
already announced she's going to

00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:16.119
spend fifty million dollars of
her own money on her campaign.

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:19.617
And so Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal who's the likely

00:49:19.617 --> 00:49:21.969
Democrat has to raise a lot of
money.

00:49:21.969 --> 00:49:25.329
So it's not necessarily
competitive struggle for the

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:28.606
people's vote,
but rather struggle for money

00:49:28.606 --> 00:49:32.768
and that has implications which
you should think about.

00:49:32.768 --> 00:49:37.922
Notice third that this
Schumpeterian story completely

00:49:37.922 --> 00:49:40.400
devalues participation.
 

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:46.128
After all, it buys into the
Buchanan and Tullock definition

00:49:46.128 --> 00:49:51.760
of the problem where we saw
participation was defined as a

00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:52.650
cost.
 

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:56.134
If you have to spend time
participating in politics it's

00:49:56.134 --> 00:49:59.746
time you could be spending
driving your Maserati and you'd

00:49:59.746 --> 00:50:01.329
rather be doing that.
 

00:50:01.329 --> 00:50:02.440
That's the assumption.
 

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.469
How good an assumption is that?
 

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:10.762
Maybe participation is
inherently valuable then you

00:50:10.762 --> 00:50:13.619
have to think about that.
 

00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:19.500
And then finally it really is a
minimal conception of democracy.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:23.865
Now some people have
operationalized Schumpeter to

00:50:23.865 --> 00:50:26.186
say,
and this is true in the

00:50:26.186 --> 00:50:30.320
comparative politics literature
about new democracies,

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:34.548
that we can't call a system a
democracy until the government

00:50:34.548 --> 00:50:37.989
has twice lost an election and
given up power.

00:50:37.989 --> 00:50:43.329
This is sometimes called the
Schumpeter two turnover test.

00:50:43.329 --> 00:50:46.835
Famous Harvard political
scientist who recently died

00:50:46.835 --> 00:50:51.099
called Samuel Huntington came up
with the two turnover test.

00:50:51.099 --> 00:50:55.826
We can't call something a
democracy unless there's been

00:50:55.826 --> 00:50:58.539
this turnover at least twice.
 

00:50:58.539 --> 00:51:00.360
In one way that's a stiff test.
 

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.110
Japan didn't meet it until very
recently.

00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:03.967
The U.S.
 

00:51:03.967 --> 00:51:06.860
didn't meet it until 1840.
 

00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:09.059
India didn't meet it until
recently.

00:51:09.059 --> 00:51:12.159
South Africa which people crow
about as a new democracy has yet

00:51:12.159 --> 00:51:12.809
to meet it.
 

00:51:12.809 --> 00:51:16.280
We don't know what would happen
if the ANC lost an election.

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:18.719
Would they give up power,
maybe, maybe not?

00:51:18.719 --> 00:51:23.159
So in one respect it's a robust
test,

00:51:23.159 --> 00:51:27.969
but people criticize it as
being minimal saying really

00:51:27.969 --> 00:51:31.510
there's more to democracy than
that,

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:33.900
and we'll come back to that
question next week,

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:38.657
but what I want you to take
away is I think the enduring

00:51:38.657 --> 00:51:43.588
insight of the Schumpeterian
model that really starts with

00:51:43.588 --> 00:51:45.320
Locke's linking.
 

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.780
Locke was very prescient;
he saw three centuries ahead.

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:53.980
Linking of majority rule to
this idea of resisting

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:57.047
domination,
that non-domination,

00:51:57.047 --> 00:52:00.409
this idea of resisting
domination,

00:52:00.409 --> 00:52:03.434
however you institutionalize it
and operationalize it and all of

00:52:03.434 --> 00:52:07.639
that,
that is the basic animating

00:52:07.639 --> 00:52:10.469
ideal of democracy.
 

00:52:10.469 --> 00:52:13.210
We'll pick up from there on
Monday.

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:19.000

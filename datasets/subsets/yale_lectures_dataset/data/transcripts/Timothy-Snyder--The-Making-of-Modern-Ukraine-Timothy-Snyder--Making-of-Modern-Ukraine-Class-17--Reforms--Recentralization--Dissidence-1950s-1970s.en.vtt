00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.747
(mysterious music)

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.890
- So today, we're gonna,

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.410
we're a little bit behind chronologically.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.240
I need to spend some more
time on the 1940s and 1950s,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.680
which is what we're gonna do today.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.810
And then the next lecture, we'll catch up

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.060
to Khrushchev and Brezhnev.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.010
What we need to make sure we understand

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.150
because it's really important

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.130
for everything that comes later

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.150
is the transition out of the war.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.710
And the reason why this is so important

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.990
is that the Second World War,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.370
I mean in addition to the ways

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.770
that it's so to speak,
objectively important,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.470
the millions of deaths,
the territorial changes,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.300
the movements of populations,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.470
it's also ideating,
ideologically very important.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.570
The Second World War is a
kind of new starting point

00:00:56.588 --> 00:00:58.380
for the legitimation of the Soviet Union,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.350
and it's also a starting
point for many other stories

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.534
of many other nations about who they are.

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:06.870
The United States is far
away from the conflict.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.700
The United States lost
relatively few people,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.380
it entered the conflict very late.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.670
But nevertheless,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.020
the Second World War is very important

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.420
for American self-formation.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.130
The closer you get to the conflict,

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.077
the more true this is,

00:01:19.077 --> 00:01:23.430
the state of Israel, Germany,
Ukraine, Belarus, Russia,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.799
contemporary countries,

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.790
run their stories of themselves

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.860
through the Second World War.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.090
And in the case of the Ukraine

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.500
and other countries we're working on,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.850
it's through the Second World War,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.550
but then also through
a kind of Soviet myth

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.780
of the Second World War.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.740
So we have to make sure

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.560
that we get the Second World War right

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.160
in order for us to watch how
that political memory forms

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.080
and then we'll have some way

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.970
to evaluate what's going on today.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.170
So in the background of everything
I'm doing today is 2022,

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.270
and the way we're thinking about nations

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.980
and the war in 2022,

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.110
I'm gonna be talking
about the '40's and '50's,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.569
but occasionally I'm going
to lurch over and remind you

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:03.540
to look for a connection.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.990
Okay so was anybody else in
New York over the weekend?

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.480
I was in, see, oh yeah,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.130
I was hoping I was gonna
be the coolest one in class

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.930
for once, all right.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.240
So I was in New York over the weekend

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.883
and I saw the new Tom Stoppard play.

00:02:18.913 --> 00:02:20.880
That's cool, right, that's cool?

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.400
Okay, good, I'm reassured.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.250
The new Tom Stoppard play
is very, it's for him,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.250
it's very straightforward,
it's very historicist,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.390
it's about a family, an Austrian Jewish,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.210
partly Jewish Austrian family

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.600
in the late 19th century

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.090
into the second half of the 20th century

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.860
and I don't want to spoil the end,

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.713
but you know, in the end,
most of them die at Auschwitz.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.190
The problem with that is

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.830
that most Austrian Jews
didn't die at Auschwitz,

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.320
like that's an easy way to close a play

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.480
because everyone thinks
the Holocaust is Auschwitz

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.770
and Auschwitz is the Holocaust.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.603
And so naturally,

00:02:56.603 --> 00:02:59.460
if you're trying to bring it
all to a tragic conclusion,

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.500
which he does very powerfully,

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.130
having the children die at
Auschwitz is the way to do that.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.510
The problem though historically

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.660
is that most Austrian
Jews died in Belarus.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.520
And once you know that odd little fact,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.060
then you are reminded that the
Second World War took place

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.470
on a territory.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.840
And you might move from
there to remembering

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.180
that the second world
war happened as a result

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.180
of German imperialism towards the East.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.000
So the actual geography of the Holocaust

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.030
reminds you that the Germans
were in a certain place,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.830
they were trying to
conquer a certain place,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.320
and that the killing began
and actually continued

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.900
in all sorts of places,
which we often forget,

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.470
like Minsk, like Riga.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.023
Auschwitz of course, was
a center of the Holocaust,

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.390
around a million Jews were killed there,

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.790
more than a million
people were killed there.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.310
But this little artifact of our culture

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.060
where everything leads to Auschwitz

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.570
has the consequence of making this think

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.960
that everything in some
way leads to nowhere

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.310
because Auschwitz is not a place

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.590
where you have to know where
it is on the map, right?

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.330
I mean, maybe you do,
maybe you've been there,

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.750
but it functions as a kind of nowhere,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.070
as a kind of zero point,

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.560
as a kind of kind of black
hole where everything ends.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.260
Right, literature ends,
philosophy ends, thought ends.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.020
Right, Primo Levi says
"Here there is no why".

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.330
But actually, the Holocaust
took place in a place,

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:22.590
and Auschwitz is also a place,

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.970
and if this were a different class,

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.840
we would spend more time

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.430
on what kind of a place Auschwitz was.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.660
But here, what I'm trying,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.190
the point I'm trying to get across

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.500
is how deep in our culture it goes

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.450
that Eastern Europe isn't really a place,

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.147
that these territories
don't really matter.

00:04:36.147 --> 00:04:37.530
And that in extremists,

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.810
we will look away from
the actual territories.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.660
And in extremists, we'll
find this reference point,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.950
which is familiar,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.200
but which gets us not looking at Ukraine

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.080
or the Baltic states or Belarus or Poland

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.100
or western Russia,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.160
which is where the Holocaust
was actually centered.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.560
The reason I'm dwelling on this

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.980
is that whether or not you
think about the territories

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.210
is going to affect

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.180
how you think about
responsibility for the war.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.950
And if we think about the lecture,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.050
so if you think about
the lecture last time

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.480
about the German factor, right,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.040
if you're a German

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.880
and you don't know

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.460
that there was a German
factor in Ukrainian history,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.460
you're not gonna be thinking
about the German factor, right?

00:05:18.324 --> 00:05:20.940
If your view of the war
doesn't have territory in it,

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.150
then it also doesn't have
most of the peoples in it

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.430
and your recollection is going
to have those peoples in it,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.110
and you're not going to be concerned

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.410
about how you come to
terms with those things.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.100
So part of colonialism is
forgetting about colonialism,

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.600
right, that's part of the trick.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.800
Part of being a colonialist,

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.140
a good colonialist forgets
about colonialism, right,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.510
and has various devices of doing so.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.750
The European Union for all
of its undoubted virtues

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.540
is a project of forgetting
about colonialism.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.460
They're not the only people,
there are other ways to do it,

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.160
but what the European Union
does is it tells a story

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.190
about how the Europeans
fought the Second World War,

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.870
they realized war was a very bad thing,

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.550
and therefore they chose peace,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.200
and unlike the Americans,
they stopped fighting wars.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.756
Yes, exactly, exclamation point,

00:06:07.756 --> 00:06:11.820
but that's not true, that's not true.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.720
What happened instead

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.760
is that Europeans kept
fighting wars until,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.433
this is much more banal,
until they lost them,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.070
which admittedly is like,

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:21.030
that doesn't really work

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.800
as the beginning of
the speech in Brussels,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.030
you know, it doesn't really work

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.240
as educational curriculum in
Europe but that's the truth.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.243
The Germans lost the Second World War,

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:30.300
which is a colonial war.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.980
The French lost in Southeast Asia,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.600
they lost in North Africa.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.600
The Portuguese and the Spanish
couldn't hold out in Africa

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.880
any longer, right, and so on and so forth.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.160
At which point, they then joined together

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.590
to this European integration process,

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:45.240
at which point they
started telling the story

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.920
about how Europeans are
very peaceful people,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.030
and we've always been very peaceful,

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:49.260
and we integrate and look at us,

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.773
and then look at the
Americans, they're bad, right?

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:54.810
That's actually the
European national anthem.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.320
It's set to a tune by Beethoven
but those are the words.

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:59.190
If you don't know German,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.533
that's actually what
they're singing, okay.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.603
Don't email me about that.

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:08.543
Okay.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.493
All right.

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.160
It's "Ode to Joy" of course, in fact.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.793
It's actually "Ode to Joy",
the words are by Schiller.

00:07:19.185 --> 00:07:21.660
But the point is that,
there's a serious point here,

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.660
which is that although
the European Union is,

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:27.810
we'll talk more about this,

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.890
but a theme of this class
is the world of empire

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.690
and what you do after empire, right?

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.940
And the European Union

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.570
is an answer to what to do after empire.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:37.440
You go back to Europe

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:39.150
and you don't talk about empire very much

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.470
and you cooperate with one another,

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.060
which has many good sides.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.970
But what it means is that
you don't talk about empire.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.210
The Dutch don't talk so
much about Indonesia, right?

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.220
And the Germans do talk
about the Holocaust,

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.330
one has to give them credit for that,

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:52.920
they absolutely do talk
about the Holocaust,

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.470
and in that sense, they do
better than everybody else,

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.960
but what they don't talk
about is imperial territory.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.020
They don't really talk about
empire or colonization,

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.610
which really is the operative framework

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.160
for what they were doing in Ukraine.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.160
And so the tricky part of
all this is that if you do,

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:13.500
if you do memory of the Holocaust,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.980
but without territory and
without the other people,

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.030
you lose sight of the fact

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.040
that you yourself were the colonizer.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.510
And since you lose sight of the fact

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.360
that you yourself were the colonizer,

00:08:24.223 --> 00:08:26.790
you tend to forget the things
that colonization involves,

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.390
like putting local people into
awkward, difficult positions.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:32.850
Right, so you don't colonize by yourself,

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:34.500
there are always more local people

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.230
involved than there are
colonizers involved,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:38.940
there have to be just mathematically.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.590
And when you're the colonizer,

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:41.910
one of the things that you're doing

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.260
is you are creating structures

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.120
that local people will be taking part in.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.280
And later on when you
remember you're the colonizer,

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.740
that's one of the things
that you think about, right?

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.090
So if you're thinking

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.800
about the European
colonization of North America,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.180
you don't just think
about what the Europeans

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.220
did to the native
peoples of North America,

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.260
you think about how they
turned them against each other

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.940
and how they used one
tribe against each other

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.773
and so on and so forth.

00:09:00.773 --> 00:09:02.970
That's part of the story, right?

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:05.890
Likewise, when Germany
invades Eastern Europe

00:09:07.374 --> 00:09:09.630
and rallies collaborators, yes,

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.040
the nation should come to terms

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.500
with their history of collaboration
in so far as it exists,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:15.780
but the Germans also should recognize

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:17.790
that this is part of their history, right,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.623
the history of colonization.

00:09:18.623 --> 00:09:20.850
Now why am I talking about all this?

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.333
I'm talking about all this
because in the 21st century,

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.220
we have a kind of problem,

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:27.053
which this lecture

00:09:27.053 --> 00:09:28.560
is going to lead us to understand I hope,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.980
which is that before this
war in 2022 broke out,

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.550
Ukraine didn't really exist
as a subject in Germany.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.580
Ukrainians didn't really
exist as a full-fledged people

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.670
from the German point of view.

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.960
Insofar as they existed,

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.550
they very often existed
as a trigger for luxury,

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.140
like you do this better,
you do that better,

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.160
you do the other thing better.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:51.810
You learn your lesson
from the Second World War,

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.830
the way that we learned our lesson

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.030
from the Second World War.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.710
But that analogy doesn't make sense

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.543
because the Germans

00:09:56.543 --> 00:09:57.960
were the colonizer in
the Second World War,

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.490
and they colonized Ukraine, right?

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.335
So you can't lecture, you
know, you can't lecture,

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:06.060
as an American, you can't
lecture the Osage about this.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:08.100
You have to sort of realize
what you did to the Osage.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.230
And the Germans weren't there yet.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:14.520
And that had the odd consequence

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.400
that up until 2022,

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.990
the Germans and the Russians

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.690
were able to find a kind of
common ground about Ukraine

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.960
along the lines of they
don't really exist.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.850
They're sort of, they're
kind of a problem for us,

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.810
they're sort of complicated,

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.070
they don't really exist.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.380
And there was a divvying up of roles

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.850
about the Second World War,

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.010
which I hope we'll be able
to challenge after this class

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.700
where Germany and Russia up to 2022,

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.740
this is now all being reconsidered,

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.820
but up to 2022,

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:43.830
the Germans and the Russians
had this kind of nice deal

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:46.290
where they divided the
good things about the war.

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.850
What the German said was,

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.470
we get the good thing

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.260
of having learned all
about it and apologized.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:53.280
And the Russians said,

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.680
we get the good thing of
having been the victims

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.780
and the victors, right,

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.100
which is a nice position to be in.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.340
And everybody else kind of
complicates the story, right?

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.980
And so from from those positions,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.450
you know, you can see eye to eye

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:08.880
like it's too bad that we invaded you

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.980
but it's a good thing you won and so on

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.080
and everyone else in the
middle kind of gets forgotten,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.950
all those territories,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.860
those awkward territories get forgotten.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.590
Together, we can reproduce
stereotypes about Ukraine,

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:21.840
together, we can talk
about how it's all corrupt.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.673
Together, we can talk

00:11:22.673 --> 00:11:24.330
about how they don't
really have a language,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:25.163
you know, and so on.

00:11:25.163 --> 00:11:26.010
We can do all these things

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.870
that are quite colonial and not notice it.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.820
together. We can build a pipeline.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.310
Together, we can become
economically dependent upon you.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:36.120
All of this goes back
to the Second World War.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:38.640
All of it goes back to
the German colonization,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.200
which I talked about last time.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.630
This time, we're going to be talking about

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.990
the way that the Soviet Union
handled the Second World War.

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.730
Without this knowledge,

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.920
we can't get to where we are now,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.101
the '70's, '80's, '90's,
21st century and 2022.

00:11:53.101 --> 00:11:57.030
Okay, so I tried to make
clear the memory stakes.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:58.740
Now let me talk about some of the,

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:00.690
some of the actual events.

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:03.660
What we're gonna do today is
we're gonna get through the war

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.090
into the end of Stalin

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.100
so you can see how this all gets set up.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.800
And the basic story is
going to be something like

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.800
the war is processed as
victimhood and victory,

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:19.770
but for Russians more than
for other people, right?

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:24.000
Once you know that that process
begins and begins in 1945,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000
the rest of it step by step to
Putin becomes less confusing.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.090
And the way that the
Russians and the Germans

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.340
are going to come to this
weird common understanding

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:37.440
about the war also becomes less confusing.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.933
Okay so history.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.190
I'm gonna take what seems
like a big lateral step now

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.603
and talk about,

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.520
and talk about the Organization
of Ukrainian Nationalists

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.680
and the ethnic cleansing of Poles

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.645
during the Second World War.

00:12:54.645 --> 00:12:57.030
How is this not a big lateral step?

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:00.330
It's not a big lateral step because

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.530
in order to understand

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:03.420
the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:06.270
and its ethnic cleansing
of Poles during the war,

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.160
you have to understand the war,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.240
and you have to understand
Soviet and German policies

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.100
during the war.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.630
So, I mean to be very clear,

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.720
if you're a Ukrainian and
you are identifying yourself

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.650
with this tradition

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:21.360
of the Organization of
Ukrainian Nationalists,

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.280
then there are things
that you need to know

00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.540
and things you have to consider

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.830
and they will be in this lecture.

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:27.450
But analytically,

00:13:27.450 --> 00:13:29.910
if we're gonna understand
where it came from,

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.617
we have to know what Soviet policy was

00:13:31.617 --> 00:13:32.970
and what German policy was

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.470
because there's a sort of mystery here.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:35.303
I mentioned

00:13:35.303 --> 00:13:37.230
the Organization of Ukrainian
Nationalists earlier

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:40.680
as a minor, mostly
imprisoned terrorist group

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.810
in Interwar Poland, right?

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:44.460
If it hadn't been for
the Second World War,

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.380
we probably wouldn't remember them,

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:47.940
with all due respect, at all.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.110
They weren't that many people.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.550
They didn't matter that much in Poland

00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:52.200
except for the few assassinations,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:55.470
and they didn't really
matter anywhere else.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:57.750
I'm definitely getting email about that,

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:59.160
but that's the truth, right?

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:03.000
The Second World War changed
the setup dramatically.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.833
How so?

00:14:03.833 --> 00:14:08.720
Well inside Poland, by the '30's,

00:14:11.045 --> 00:14:13.770
there was a consensus among
Ukrainian political life

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.720
to accept the Polish state.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.070
That was hard,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:19.350
it was disappointing that
there was no Ukrainian state.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.970
But by the second half of the 1930s,

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:21.990
people generally understood

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.910
that the Soviet Union was much worse,

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:25.320
that Poland was threatened,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.870
and therefore we accept the
legality of the Polish state,

00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:30.180
we try to function within it.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.180
That position, which was the
majority Ukrainian position

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.430
by the second half of the
1930s, becomes impossible

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:39.623
when?

00:14:41.554 --> 00:14:42.750
- [Student] When Poland ceases to exist.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.930
- Poland ceases to exist,
100% exactly right.

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.710
I mean it seems like such an easy point,

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:53.340
but the difference between a
state existing and not existing

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.620
is traumatic for all of the citizens,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:59.250
but especially for the
national minorities.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:00.690
If this were a class on the Holocaust,

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:02.940
I would now be spending a
lot more time on that point

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.320
with respect to the Jews.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:08.280
Because membership in a
state which treats you poorly

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.080
is still very much different

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.050
than non-membership in any state,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:15.000
right, that's the
argument in "Black Earth".

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.850
For the Ukrainians, it suddenly means

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.650
there's no one to cooperate with

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.530
that was a legitimate state a day before.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.840
The democratic parties,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.380
like UNDO, which I mentioned
last time, they melt away,

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:30.990
the left wing parties or the
radical left wing parties,

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.840
the communists and the
cryptocommunist parties,

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:36.030
they cooperate with the Soviets

00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:38.580
in what becomes Western Ukraine.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.380
And as we saw last time
or the time before,

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.450
they become disappointed.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:46.500
What's left after that
is the extreme right.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.120
The Organization of
Ukrainian Nationalists,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.470
the people who have experience,

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.150
who have a coherent ideology

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:54.690
of national superiority and discipline,

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.790
who have practice being underground,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.590
unlike everybody else
except the communists,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.090
and the communists have
now come above ground

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:01.050
and been disappointed,

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:02.900
they have practice being underground.

00:16:04.336 --> 00:16:06.720
They are willing to do
things like use violence,

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.870
which the other parties weren't
necessarily willing to do.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:11.670
So they're advantaged in that way,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.070
if that's the word, by 1939.

00:16:14.905 --> 00:16:16.440
They are also advantaged,

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.050
or they're also transformed
by the war itself.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:24.000
So by the time the Germans
invade the Soviet Union,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.430
the Soviets are just starting to find

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.310
and deport the Ukrainian Nationalists.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.530
Germany invades the Soviet Union,

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:36.530
and the Ukrainian Nationalists
declare a Ukrainian state.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.270
That was not the German's
idea at all, right?

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.830
So you now know enough

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:42.390
about the German understanding of Ukraine

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.030
to understand that it didn't
require the Ukrainians

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.863
to found a state.

00:16:45.863 --> 00:16:46.860
On the contrary,

00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.320
Ukraine was meant to be
colonized by Germany.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.510
If there were some Ukrainians
who would be useful in that,

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:54.420
all the better, but the
idea was to create a colony.

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:58.530
So in early July, 1941,
sorry late June, 1941,

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:00.180
the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:02.070
decides to declare a state.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.800
This effort fails dramatically

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.610
because the Germans don't support it.

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:08.940
Okay, this is a crucial point here, right?

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:10.260
The Germans are all in favor

00:17:10.260 --> 00:17:12.690
of Ukrainian non-political collaboration,

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:13.620
but they have no interest

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:15.720
in Ukrainian political collaboration.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.460
So the people who declare independence

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.110
generally get sent to camps.

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.120
Roughly four-fifths of the leaders

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.470
of the Ukrainian Nationalists

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:24.690
now go to German camps or prisons,

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.130
including Stepan Bandera,

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.750
who is the one who is
most often mentioned.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.570
So Bandera spent the Second World War,

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:33.387
or most of the second world
war in Bergbauernhilfe

00:17:33.387 --> 00:17:35.160
in a German camp.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.500
He wrote letters, it's
true, but he had very,

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.620
I mean he's the figure that
the Russians now fixate on,

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:41.670
but he had very little to do

00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:43.350
directly with anything
that happened in the war,

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.330
because he was in a German camp.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:49.350
But the reason this is
relevant is that the,

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.050
what was already a very
radical organization

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.470
was stripped of its top leadership.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:57.390
And very, no offense,

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:59.613
very young people were suddenly in charge,

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.090
people who had, just for the
record, that got one smile,

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:05.883
okay, very young people
were suddenly in charge.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:10.050
And this meant that

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.120
was what was already a
kind of unpredictable,

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.750
violent organization becomes more so.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.510
What's worse, just before this happened,

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.980
the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.690
had split into two fractions

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.390
associated with these two
leaders, Melnyk and Bandera,

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:28.530
and those two fractions set
about killing one another,

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:29.790
thereby further disrupting

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:31.620
the leadership structure
of the organization

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.260
and making it more likely
that it would carry out

00:18:34.260 --> 00:18:36.540
other kinds of disruptive acts.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:37.740
Many of these people

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.110
do in fact collaborate with the Germans.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.400
We're talking about a few thousand people

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.810
in a nation of tens of millions,

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:46.950
but many of them do in fact
collaborate with the Germans,

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.070
some of them are in the
German police force.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:51.060
And this too,

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.370
so this is where my
earlier point comes in,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.780
none of that could have happened

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.190
without the German invasion.

00:18:56.190 --> 00:18:59.670
Right so these men, a
few thousand of them,

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.050
get a specific form of training
as a result of the war.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.780
Oh and it's more
interesting than I just said

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:09.540
because I know this is the hard part,

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:11.400
you see, it already messed me up,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:13.560
when Poland is broken,

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.750
the power that comes into Eastern Poland

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.280
is the Soviet Union.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.130
And a lot of young men then join,

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:24.600
a lot of young Ukrainian men
then join the Soviet militia.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.280
And those deportations of Poles,

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.080
which I mentioned earlier
and will mention again,

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.080
many times, the local militia
men who carried them out

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:33.900
were of Ukrainian nationality.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:35.940
Here comes the part of the
story that nobody likes,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.070
but which is, there are many
parts that nobody likes,

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.380
but this part particularly nobody likes.

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.770
When the Soviets are
driven out by the Germans

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:45.600
in summer 1941,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.290
a lot of those Soviet militia
men of Ukrainian nationality

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:50.850
then joined the Germans.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.190
Now from a human perspective,

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.050
this is totally normal.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.510
If you're a young man who'd
been making his living

00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:00.870
as a kind of quasi police
officer on the countryside

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:04.350
and one power goes away
and the other power comes,

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:05.700
and they also are in need of a job

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:07.170
doing basically the same thing,

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:08.490
you know, carrying a baton

00:20:08.490 --> 00:20:10.980
and driving people into
deportation columns,

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.420
different people to be sure,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.040
you're probably gonna take the same job,

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.990
right, a lot of it is as banal is that.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.300
But in our world of ideology
where we think like,

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.250
oh, they're Stalinists and they're Nazis,

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.440
and they're this nation
and they're that nation

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.120
and that determines everything they do,

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.740
it's very hard to get our minds around

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:28.420
the kind of basic social
fact of double collaboration

00:20:29.355 --> 00:20:31.830
and the basic human realities,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.530
which led a lot of people
to behave in that way.

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:36.810
But what this means is
that a lot of these men

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:37.950
who just had experience

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:40.710
putting Poles and other
people onto deportation trains

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:43.920
are now serving as
German auxiliary police,

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.920
mostly enforcing the German idea of law

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.330
on their fellow Ukrainians,

00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:51.060
but among other things, and
this is very significant,

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.000
taking part in the policy
of the mass murder of Jews,

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.010
which we know as the Holocaust.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:58.230
So as always in a colonial situation,

00:20:58.230 --> 00:21:01.080
there are relatively few
people from the colonial power.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.040
About 1,400 Germans

00:21:03.948 --> 00:21:06.060
are directly involved in rounding up Jews.

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:09.360
About 12,000 locals are
responsible for the murder

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:13.170
of about 200,000 Jews in Western Ukraine.

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:14.340
I'm talking about Western Ukraine

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.350
because that's where
the nationalists were.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:18.032
The people who were
the locals, by the way,

00:21:18.032 --> 00:21:20.460
they were Ukrainians, but
they weren't only Ukrainians.

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.260
There were also Poles,
there were other people,

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:24.270
but they were predominantly Ukrainians

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.010
in this part of the world.

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.650
And then all of these Jews were murdered,

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:29.640
usually by Germans,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.070
but certainly with the increasing help,

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.690
especially after 1942

00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.150
of locals by bullets at close range.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:37.870
So that is the education

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:41.880
that several thousand young men got.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.790
They wouldn't have gotten this
education in interwar Poland.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.870
They certainly wouldn't have gotten it

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:47.700
in an independent Ukraine.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:51.450
They got it as a result of a
joint German Soviet invasion

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:54.150
and then as a result of a
German invasion of the territory

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.553
which the Soviets just took.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.090
These men were then the ones

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.970
who were directly involved
in ethnic cleansing of Poles

00:22:05.525 --> 00:22:06.900
in 1943.

00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:11.900
The conjuncture was that the
Germans are being driven out,

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:15.270
it looks like the Soviets are coming.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:17.340
The Soviets, okay here comes
another part of the story,

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:18.360
which nobody likes,

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.910
but which is absolutely
true and important,

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.350
the Soviets are recruiting people

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:24.720
for their own partisan movement.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.930
They are not picky at all about
who those people are, right?

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.030
So plenty of German collaborators

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:33.750
go right into the Soviet
partisan movement.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.970
The Soviets are recruiting them.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.890
They're trying to recruit German policemen

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:39.510
to the Soviet partisans.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.520
And one attempt to try to,

00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.620
one attempt to try to
recruit them negatively

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.090
by a provocation ends up with
a lot of Ukrainian policemen,

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.130
German policemen of Ukrainian nationality

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:52.560
going over to what turns out to be

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.290
a Ukrainian partisan movement.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:56.790
And that Ukrainian partisan movement,

00:22:56.790 --> 00:23:00.510
the UPA on your sheet,
these are the people

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:02.340
who carry out the ethnic
cleansing of Poles

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:06.870
in the summer of 1943, tens of thousands.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.790
The Poles respond,

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:11.100
they kill a fair number of Ukrainians too,

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.800
especially in Galicia.

00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.900
And this end, and so you
can imagine this scene now,

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.300
by 1944 when the Red Army appears,

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.650
the Red Army appears on territories

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.530
where Ukrainians and Poles
are busily killing one,

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:24.453
killing one another, okay so.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:32.100
Going back to where we are now, it is,

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.030
it's just important to
remember that these crimes,

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:37.800
which have to be known about,

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:38.880
this history which has to be known

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.830
whether you're Ukrainian or not,

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.360
if you're German,

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.680
what you have to know about them

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.710
is that they would never have
happened without you, right?

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.090
They would never have
happened without you.

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.860
Without the German colonization policy,

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.170
none of this would have happened.

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.880
The men who take part in all of this,

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.010
if you're Ukrainian and you
identify with Ukrainians,

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:56.880
then you think about this

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.740
and you think about
responsibility, I think.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.900
But if you're a German, you think,

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.940
huh, it looks like we
created the conditions

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.670
in which something like
this could happen, right?

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:07.890
That is part of what
doing colonial history

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:11.580
or doing imperial history
reflectively involves.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:14.343
Okay and then yeah.

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.330
One more reflection about Ukraine.

00:24:18.330 --> 00:24:20.930
The OUN, the Organization
of Ukrainian Nationalists,

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.000
this small group which
became important briefly

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.490
during the Second World War and after,

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:27.960
it had a very specific notion

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.820
of what the Ukrainian nation was.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.470
It was a hierarchical notion

00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:33.450
with a leader who would
have absolute power,

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:35.550
or a small group of men who
would have absolute power.

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.980
The power would be exercised vertically.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.180
The Ukrainian ethnos

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.550
was thought to be a kind of super group,

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:44.583
super, the ubermenschen
among all the other people's.

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.550
That and more.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:49.650
I'm just gonna note that
that is very different

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.410
than the notion of Ukrainian nationality

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:54.330
which is prevailing now, right?

00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:56.430
And it's also very different,

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.670
I'll note something else,
they lost, the UPA lost,

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.950
and the Ukrainian state as
it's currently configured,

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:03.870
which is on a very different basis

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.390
with a Jewish democratically
elected president

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.990
and a very horizontally
organized civil society,

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:13.740
that Ukrainian setup is not
only the one that we have,

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.570
but it's the one which is winning a war.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:17.040
Okay, I'm just gonna close with that

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.240
and people can reflect on it

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.730
'cause we really have to get
to where we're going now,

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.920
which is Soviet ethnic cleansing.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.990
So the Soviets,

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.690
and this is another irony
of the war or not irony,

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:31.260
the Soviets pick up in many
ways where the Germans,

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.490
or locally in West Ukraine,

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.580
where the Ukrainian
Nationalists leave off.

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:37.470
The Soviets ethnically cleanse

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.740
with ferocity and
determination and with purpose

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:44.160
at the end of the Second World War.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.870
You'll remember that in the '30's,

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:47.130
the Soviets were pioneers

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:48.810
of what we now call ethnic cleansing

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:51.390
with the national actions of 1937 and '38,

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:55.353
directed against notably
Poles, Latvians, Koreans.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.280
During the Second World War, '40, '41,

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.320
there were these four major deportations

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.930
from territories taken from Poland.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.400
When the Germans invaded,

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:09.630
Stalin deported ethnic Germans
for the first time on mass

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.080
with such organization and such skill

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.670
that the Germans themselves were envious,

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:15.780
which by the way is a theme.

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.540
The Soviets had a deportation apparatus,

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.210
which was very precise, which
the Germans never actually,

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.928
never actually had.

00:26:22.928 --> 00:26:25.950
And in 1940, you can see
the German policemen,

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.120
who at that time were in a form

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.440
of cooperation with the Soviets

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.480
and observing what they were doing,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.950
in their correspondence back to Berlin,

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.060
they would express this envy.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:34.590
Like we don't have an apparatus like this,

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:35.670
we couldn't do this kind of thing

00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:37.440
the way that the Soviets are doing.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.340
But that's just to remind you

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:43.340
that ethnic cleansing
as a operational habit

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:44.850
was already present.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.020
When the Soviets take back
territory in '43, '44,

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:51.780
they take entire national groups

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.560
and deport them deep
into the Soviet depths.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.510
I don't have time to go
into all the examples now,

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:00.580
but it's peoples of the caucuses

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:03.930
and then it's peoples of Crimea.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:06.510
And for the purposes of
a class about Ukraine,

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:10.140
the Crimean Tatars are the
most important example.

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:13.020
The Crimean Tatars were of
course, as we would say now,

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:16.320
the indigenous people of
the Crimean Peninsula.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.753
As you'll remember from
not so many weeks ago,

00:27:20.655 --> 00:27:24.060
the Crimean Khanate had
been a state for 400 years

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.360
before the Russian Empire
came in the late 18th century.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.410
In the late 18th century,

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.120
there were essentially no Russians

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.190
in what was called New Russia,

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:35.310
but the Crimean Tatars were
about 100% of the population

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.663
of the Crimean Peninsula.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.430
By spring of 1944, that was zero.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.340
That was zero because in March of 1944,

00:27:45.713 --> 00:27:49.440
180,014 people identified
as Crimean Tatars,

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.750
men, women and children,
were all forcibly deported,

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.520
most of them to Uzbekistan

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.250
on the logic that the
entire Crimean Tatar people

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:58.100
had collaborated with not to Germany.

00:27:59.247 --> 00:28:00.420
And this logic, this totalizing logic

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.340
was applied also to Crimean Tatars

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:03.740
who returned from the front,

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.210
including Crimean Tatars

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:07.920
who had just been
involved in taking Berlin.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.120
They were all accused

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.130
of being collaborators with Nazi Germany

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:14.670
and all to a person deported
far away from their home,

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:16.200
such that the Crimean peninsula

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.990
became empty of its indigenous population

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:21.033
as of spring of 1944.

00:28:23.686 --> 00:28:26.343
Minor note, they were
deported in Studebakers,

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.313
American automobiles,

00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:32.240
which is just another one

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.050
of these interesting historical facts

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:35.910
that are so essential for
how things actually happen,

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:38.370
but which everybody afterwards
doesn't want to remember.

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:40.770
The Soviet Union was able to defend itself

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:43.170
because of American economic aid.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:44.190
The role that the United States

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.120
played in the Second World War,

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.380
at least on the European front,

00:28:46.380 --> 00:28:48.930
was mostly economic until close to the end

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:52.230
and it was instantiated
in our very relevant

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.560
material aid to the Soviet
Union even across the Pacific.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:56.730
The Americans don't like to remember that

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:57.563
because of the Cold War,

00:28:57.563 --> 00:28:58.590
the Soviets don't like to remember it

00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:59.423
because of the Cold War

00:28:59.423 --> 00:29:02.010
but that's the truth.

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.510
And if you think of the NKVD

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.690
deporting the Crimean Tatars
in Studebakers, in Jeeps,

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.420
it can help you remember
that constellation,

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.440
which only a couple of years
later would seem very strange.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:17.640
So this notion that you
deport an entire people

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.440
because they supposedly collaborated

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.860
as a people with the Nazis is helpful,

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:24.120
not just so that we understand

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.980
the particular failure
of the Crimean Tatars,

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.150
to which we're gonna return

00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:29.450
because it's a part of
the history of Ukraine,

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:34.500
but also it helps to place
in context the general idea

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.600
that I'm going to do something
to you as a collective

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.920
because you're Nazis, right,

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.780
or because you collaborated with Nazis.

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.520
This is a very fruitful idea

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.550
in Soviet and then Russian practice

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.650
beginning no later than 1943.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:55.340
So a similar idea is applied

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.650
when the Soviets get to Western Ukraine

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:03.180
where they then refer to
Ukrainian Nationalists,

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.100
the partisans I spoke about before,

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.740
but also self-conscious
Ukrainians in general

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:09.010
as collaborators

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.830
and associate them with Nazi rule.

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:16.680
And here, of course, there's a case

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:20.010
thousands of these men and
women had in fact collaborated.

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:20.880
It would be wrong to say

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.640
that the entire group had
collaborated, many of them had,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.980
but of course many other people had.

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:29.340
As no one will ever say,
Russians also collaborated.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.440
Right, every national
group in the Soviet Union

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.120
to say something which is not,

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.430
which is controversial, but shouldn't be,

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:37.596
every national group in the Soviet Union

00:30:37.596 --> 00:30:39.540
that was touched by
German power collaborated.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.028
They all did.

00:30:41.028 --> 00:30:42.697
And any attempt by one group
in the Soviet Union to say,

00:30:42.697 --> 00:30:45.180
"Well, we were innocent and
the other ones were guilty",

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.260
wrong.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.690
The statistical evidence
of which we have a fair bit

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.160
shows that the only group

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.060
which might have collaborated

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.520
a little bit more than the
others, not surprisingly,

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.040
were the ethnic Germans themselves.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:57.780
And the only group which perhaps

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.000
maybe did a little bit
less than the others

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.770
as far as we can tell
were the Belorussians.

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.130
But in general, everybody collaborated.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:07.890
And so in general, the
claim from the Soviet side

00:31:07.890 --> 00:31:10.620
that we were innocent but the
other ones were collaborators

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.760
is going to be wrong.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.280
But Stalin had power so he
could make this kind of argument

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.380
and it was made in Western Ukraine.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.150
The way that the Soviets
approached Western Ukraine

00:31:18.150 --> 00:31:19.230
has two parts.

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.953
The first is defeat the nationalist
movement, which they do.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.880
The Ukrainian partisan army
or insurgent army, this UPA,

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.710
had been formed to fight the Soviets.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:29.910
It's remembered in Poland,

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.620
and it is remembered in Poland

00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:33.510
for ethnically cleansing the Poles,

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:38.250
but it was built to fight the Soviet Union

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.650
and it did I mean with,

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.020
it should be said, with
incredible determination.

00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:44.940
They fought on for a very long time

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.550
against both Soviet power
and Polish communist power

00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:50.220
into the late '40's or
even the early 1950s,

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:51.053
although by that time,

00:31:51.053 --> 00:31:53.730
a lot of it was already
controlled by the Soviets.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:56.880
This was beaten down
with counterinsurgency,

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.940
which was just as violent
as the insurgency itself.

00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.790
A man called Nikita Khrushchev
defined the principle

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:05.580
that we should be more
violent towards them

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.580
than they are towards us
because that's the only way to,

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.260
that's the only way to defeat them.

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:13.770
That the Soviets use
practices such as, you know,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:15.120
they would kill,

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.890
when they killed a nationalist partisan,

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:20.250
they would bring the body and
drop it in the local village

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.300
to see who would come out

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:22.860
because whoever came out were the family

00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.600
and then the family would be deported

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.433
because the principle

00:32:25.433 --> 00:32:27.450
was that the families would be deported.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:31.290
So about 250,000 people were
deported from Western Ukraine.

00:32:31.290 --> 00:32:33.540
Probably a larger number
of people were killed

00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:35.400
during this counter insurgency.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.470
So one approach to Western Ukraine

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:38.883
was to crush the insurgency,

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.360
by killing the partisans and
deporting their family members.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.360
At this time, the Gulag became
disproportionately Ukrainian.

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.360
The other approach was to
fulfill the nationalist agenda.

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.950
And this is a feature
of post-war communism

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.150
in Eastern Europe in general

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:56.400
is that it makes a hard ethnic turn.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.373
So they fulfill the
nationalist agenda, number one,

00:33:00.815 --> 00:33:02.970
by giving Ukraine westerly borders.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:06.810
In 1945, the Soviet Union
basically gets the same borders

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.820
from the Americans and the British

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:11.580
that they did from the Nazis in 1939.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.610
Again, a point that no one
really is super comfortable with,

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:16.770
but with a few small exceptions.

00:33:16.770 --> 00:33:19.800
Basically, the border of
1945 is the border of 1939,

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.240
which means that once again,

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:25.173
Soviet Ukraine is extended
significantly to the west.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.110
Some of this is is from other places,

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:30.600
but most of this is
formally Polish territories.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.120
And this deprived the Ukrainian
Nationalists of an argument

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.140
because Ukrainian Nationalists

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:36.960
were all about creating a larger Ukraine.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.300
And the Soviet Union

00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:43.293
continues the ethnic cleansing
of local non-Ukrainians.

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.023
They basically,

00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:48.150
the NKVD basically comes in and picks up

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:49.260
in a more organized way

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.380
where the Ukrainian
Nationalists had left off.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:57.210
About 1.5 million pre-war Polish citizens

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.380
will be deported

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.710
from what becomes the western
part of Soviet Ukraine.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.470
And 1.5 million is a pretty big number.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:08.760
Incidentally, of those Polish citizens,

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:13.760
roughly 100,000 were Jewish
survivors of the Holocaust

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.880
who were deported westward to Poland

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.710
because they were not Ukrainian.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:21.030
And the reason this,

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.040
there are many reasons that
might seem strange to you,

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.440
but one of them surely would be

00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.510
that this is an ethnic deportation.

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.450
So it wasn't about citizenship.

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:31.660
The Soviets were saying

00:34:33.305 --> 00:34:34.560
if you're an Eastern Slav, basically,

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.680
if you're a Belorussian or
a Ukrainian you can stay,

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.760
but if you're a Pole or a
Jew, then you have to go,

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.660
then you have to go.

00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:45.510
Right, so those people were deported.

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:47.640
Meanwhile, simultaneously,

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:50.550
Ukrainians are being deported from Poland

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.860
in the opposite direction, right?

00:34:52.860 --> 00:34:55.620
So the ethnic cleansing
goes in both sides.

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:59.340
The first major policy of
the Polish Communist regime

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.410
is to deport Ukrainians, right?

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:02.940
So they legitimate themselves

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.120
on the basis of what had been
a hard right Polish position

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.560
before the Second World War.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.610
Right before the Second World War

00:35:08.610 --> 00:35:10.860
the idea of deporting all
the remaining Ukrainians

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.990
would've been almost
beyond the imagination.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:15.210
It's the first thing
that the communists do.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:17.430
And in that way, their polish communism

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:18.570
is ethnic from the beginning.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.190
It will be ethnic in other ways later on.

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:23.220
For example, in 1968, they
will try to deport the Jews.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:28.220
But the original sin, so to
speak, is 1945, '46, '47.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:33.710
In 1947, the Ukrainians
who remain in Poland

00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.070
after this deportation,

00:35:35.070 --> 00:35:38.610
most of them are deported inside Poland

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.510
in an action which is
remembered as Operation Vistula,

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:47.510
where the idea is to take
Ukrainians and disperse them

00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.390
around the so-called recovered
territories of Poland,

00:35:51.390 --> 00:35:53.213
the lands that Poland got from Germany.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:57.840
And the idea was to
take them as individuals

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.233
so that they couldn't form
Ukrainian communities again.

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.780
So that's the way that,

00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.490
that's the way the Ukrainian question

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.110
was handled in communist Poland.

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:10.650
And it was associated

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.480
with the attempt of the communist regime

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.271
to legitimate itself quite
openly from the beginning.

00:36:15.271 --> 00:36:17.070
And the idea that
Ukrainians were the enemy

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.300
or one of the main enemies,

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:20.220
the second enemy after the Germans,

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.010
was very important to
legitimating Polish communism

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.806
all the way to the end.

00:36:24.806 --> 00:36:27.180
The Ukrainians were demonized
within Polish communism

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.643
all the way through the 1980s.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.360
The conflict between Poles
and Ukrainians was very real,

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.630
but it was exploited by the
Polish communist regime.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.250
And this was very convenient, of course,

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.720
for the Soviets, right?

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.730
Because the last thing
the Soviets would want

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.260
would be some kind of Polish Ukrainian

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.700
cooperation or understanding.

00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:47.160
And as we will see a few
lectures down the line,

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:50.160
when you get to Polish
Ukrainian understanding

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:51.570
about history and many other things,

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:52.650
that is one of the factors

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:56.250
that leads to the end of
the Soviet Union, okay.

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:57.083
So this is a very,

00:36:57.083 --> 00:36:58.230
from the Polish point of view,

00:36:58.230 --> 00:37:00.130
this is of course a very real history.

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:04.890
In the post '89 period,

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:07.470
both a president and a
prime minister of Poland

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.320
have had family members
who were killed in Viluna,

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.970
which they may or may not
talk about publicly, right?

00:37:13.830 --> 00:37:17.730
This is a fact about Polish
political life, which makes,

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:19.740
I'm just gonna say this,
just gonna note this,

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.740
it makes the reception of
the six or seven million

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:26.100
Ukrainian refugees in
2022 much more interesting

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.207
because a lot of people when
they look at that, they say,

00:37:28.207 --> 00:37:29.520
"Oh, well, the Ukrainians and the Poles,

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.960
well I mean surely they just like,

00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.880
they're friends, they look at
them, they're white people,

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.350
they must get along, right?"

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:37.020
From a distance, it can
look like that, right?

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:39.990
But in fact, Ukrainian Polish relations

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.000
are incredibly complicated,

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.130
as you've probably gathered in this class.

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.740
And 1943 is one of many,

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.785
and Ukrainians would point to others

00:37:48.785 --> 00:37:49.618
on the other side, of course,

00:37:49.618 --> 00:37:50.700
one of many very difficult moments

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.350
in Ukrainian Polish relations.

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.480
So the 2022 thing

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.420
is actually much, much more
interesting than it looks.

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.520
A lot of Americans looked
at it from our own optic

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.250
and didn't see like, oh wow,

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:04.710
like something special is
actually happening here,

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:06.730
which I think it's fair to say there was.

00:38:06.730 --> 00:38:11.560
Okay, the underlying move here
though, as you've noticed,

00:38:13.751 --> 00:38:15.000
is a move towards,

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.200
is a move towards what you could think of

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:24.020
as a quietly emerging
Russian ethnic definition

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.330
of the Soviet state

00:38:27.161 --> 00:38:32.161
where ethnicity itself has
become much more important.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:34.920
Soviet Ukraine has been enlarged,

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.060
it's been reformed,

00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:37.931
it has a slightly different,

00:38:37.931 --> 00:38:40.359
has a different kind of
population with fewer Poles,

00:38:40.359 --> 00:38:41.860
and of course, far fewer Jews

00:38:42.748 --> 00:38:44.850
who have been murdered in the Holocaust.

00:38:44.850 --> 00:38:48.090
But underneath that,

00:38:48.090 --> 00:38:50.640
there's a notion that it's
ethnicity that matters

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.920
and that it's the Russian ethnicity

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:54.320
which is the most important.

00:38:55.378 --> 00:38:56.211
And to make this case,

00:38:56.211 --> 00:38:57.090
which is the last thing
we're gonna talk about,

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.580
I'm gonna start with
something that Stalin said

00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.060
at the end of the war, two
weeks after the end of the war,

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:04.890
24 May, 1945.

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:08.460
And this is when Stalin
makes his famous toast

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.510
to the great Russian nation,

00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:11.790
which I'm gonna read
to you in its entirety

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.430
because it's important.

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:16.110
Okay, "Comrades,

00:39:16.110 --> 00:39:17.970
permit me to propose one more last toast.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:19.050
I should like to propose a toast

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.460
to the health of our Soviet people,

00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.070
and in the first place,
the Russian people.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.060
I drink in the first place

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:25.170
to the health of the Russian people

00:39:25.170 --> 00:39:27.840
because it is the most outstanding
nation of all the nations

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.490
forming the Soviet Union.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:31.290
I propose a toast to the
health of the Russian people

00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:34.380
because it has won in this
war universal recognition

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.850
as the leading force of the Soviet Union

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.710
among all the peoples of our country.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:39.330
I propose a toast to the
health of the Russian people,

00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:40.890
not only because it is leading people,

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:42.540
but because it possesses a clear mind,

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:44.610
a staunch character and patience.

00:39:44.610 --> 00:39:46.020
Our government made not a few errors.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.760
We experienced at moments
of desperate situation

00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:50.580
in 1941, 1942, when our
army was retreating,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.970
abandoning our own villages and
towns, et cetera, et cetera.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:55.710
A different people could
have said to the government,

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:57.180
you have failed to justify expectations.

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.650
Go away, we shall install
another government,

00:39:58.650 --> 00:39:59.850
which will conclude peace with Germany

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:01.170
and ensure us a quiet life.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.450
The Russian people, however,
did not take this path

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:04.590
because it trusted the correctness

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.640
of the policy of its government

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:09.032
and it made sacrifices to
ensure the route of Germany.

00:40:09.032 --> 00:40:09.865
The confidence of the Russian people

00:40:09.865 --> 00:40:12.450
in the Soviet government proved
to be that decisive force

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.980
which ensured the historic victory

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:16.140
over the enemy of humanity, over fascism.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:19.462
Thanks to it, the Russian
people for this confidence.

00:40:19.462 --> 00:40:20.687
To the health of the Russian people."

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:24.930
Now there's something ironic
about a toast to fascism

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:26.250
where you talk about how your nation

00:40:26.250 --> 00:40:27.480
is better than everybody else's.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.093
Yes?

00:40:29.093 --> 00:40:29.926
- [Student] Why is he saying this?

00:40:29.926 --> 00:40:30.847
He's Georgian, right?

00:40:30.847 --> 00:40:34.890
- Yeah, yeah, he's Georgian,
that's right, he's Georgian.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.147
But you don't,

00:40:36.147 --> 00:40:37.650
you know, you don't have
to belong to a nation

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:41.673
to use or even believe in an ethnic idea.

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:47.493
But see, I want you to note
the difficulties in all this.

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:49.620
Russia was great,

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.390
and I'm now only slightly paraphrasing

00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:53.950
because it was less
touched by German power

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:56.730
than Belarus and Ukraine.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:57.870
You see?

00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:59.700
The Russians are steadfast and patient,

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:01.380
that's Stalin's spin,

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.273
because they're not occupied.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.560
Of course, the German war
did kill many Russians.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.490
The most atrocious example is the hunger,

00:41:11.490 --> 00:41:13.830
the terror siege, the
hunger siege of Leningrad

00:41:13.830 --> 00:41:15.870
in which more than a
million people are killed.

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:17.430
The scale of Russian death

00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:21.570
is horrible from a Western
point of view, it's terrifying.

00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:24.930
But it's much less proportionately

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:28.410
than the scale of death in
Belarus and Ukraine, much less,

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:29.460
even, not just relatively,

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:32.430
but with respect to Ukraine, absolutely.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:36.540
It's fewer people, fewer
civilians killed than Russians.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:38.070
And the reason why,

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.630
you know, the reason why the Soviet Union

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.950
won the Second World War,

00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:44.280
isn't that just that Russians
came running to the rescue.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.813
You know, on the contrary,

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.920
more Ukrainian soldiers die

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:51.390
fighting the Germans in the Red Army

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:54.240
than Americans, British
and French put together.

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.970
And when the Red Army is
pushing back through Ukraine

00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.160
and taking horrible losses, which it does,

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.620
of all of its peoples,
including the Russians for sure,

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.140
but it's picking up its
reserves from Ukraine

00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:07.923
as it's then moving into
Poland and towards Berlin.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.110
So what happens is
ironically here by 1945,

00:42:13.110 --> 00:42:15.370
is that you have this capacity

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:19.440
to decide which nation is great,

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.900
which nation is greater
than the other nation.

00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.720
And you have implicitly
also the power to decide

00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.620
who's the collaborator and who is not.

00:42:27.519 --> 00:42:29.370
And that's going to be the
legacy of the Second World War,

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:30.840
a major legacy of the Second World War

00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.440
for Soviet and Russian
power for decades onwards.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:38.200
And it's based on what I
wouldn't hesitate to call

00:42:39.330 --> 00:42:42.480
a flat out totalitarian lie,

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.510
because you see what's happened by 1945.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:49.800
The man who after Hitler is
most personally responsible

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.360
for beginning the Second World War,

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.270
and indeed, the man who with Hitler

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:59.130
began the second world
war as an ally in 1939,

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:01.530
now has the authority to define

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:04.350
who are the real collaborators, right?

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:07.025
And no one is ever supposed
to think about that.

00:43:07.025 --> 00:43:07.858
And indeed, in Russia today,

00:43:07.858 --> 00:43:08.691
there's a law which forbids you

00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:10.410
from mentioning anything along those lines

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:13.140
in any kind of media, right?

00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:15.990
But this power to have
been the ally of Hitler

00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:18.690
and then to tell you who
the ally of Hitler is

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:20.760
is very important for Soviet practice

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:22.920
and it also helps a great deal now.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.840
If you're trying to understand
the Russian rhetoric

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:27.450
about Nazis and de-Nazification
and fascism and so on,

00:43:27.450 --> 00:43:29.280
it helps a lot to know

00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.460
that the Nazis are who
we say they are, right?

00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:35.070
The Nazis are who we say they
are and that's what it means,

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:37.170
the collaborators are who we say they are.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.863
So as the Cold War begins,

00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:46.620
there's a new cultural focus on Ukraine,

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.930
which is defined by a
fellow called Zhdanov

00:43:53.304 --> 00:43:55.200
in a larger cultural turn.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:58.173
And the attitude about Ukraine
is something like this,

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.653
that there are two camps in the world,

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:04.950
and the camps are,

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:06.780
they call them the democracies.

00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:10.743
Right, Zhdanov when he says
the democracies, he means us,

00:44:12.072 --> 00:44:14.220
he means he means the
Soviet Union and its allies,

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.460
and then there are the
fascists, the capitalists.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:19.530
And in these two camps,

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.120
what's interesting about these camps,

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.733
there's not really any
longer a vision of progress.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.070
And let me pause on that

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.290
because it's really, really important.

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:29.610
After the Second World War,

00:44:29.610 --> 00:44:32.050
the Soviet notion of legitimacy

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:35.190
is gonna be based much less on economics

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:37.200
and much more on culture.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.820
And the reason for this

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.030
is that the Stalinist
transformation of the Soviet economy

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:43.863
has essentially been completed.

00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:47.640
Awkwardly, the Stalinist transformation

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.520
of the Soviet economy did
not actually bring socialism

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:51.480
in any sense.

00:44:51.480 --> 00:44:53.609
I mean we can call it
socialism if you want,

00:44:53.609 --> 00:44:54.990
we can call it state socialism,
we can call it whatever,

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:58.680
but it's not socialism in
the sense understood by Marx.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.650
We do not have harmony,
we do not have equality.

00:45:01.650 --> 00:45:03.150
We don't have any of the things

00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:05.400
which any of the 19th century idealists,

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.130
or Marx in is more sentimental
moments, described.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:10.020
None of that prevails in the Soviet Union.

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.420
But the Stalinist transformation is over.

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:13.590
Collectivization has happened.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.600
The factories have been built,
the mines have been dug.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.190
You can dig some more,
you can build some more,

00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:19.050
but essentially the
transformation has happened

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:21.570
and it hasn't brought the expected result.

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.880
Instead, there's been a terrifying war,

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.010
which the Soviet Union just barely won

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.120
with the help of the Americans,

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.520
which has to be now
forgotten very quickly.

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:31.318
But this fundamentally,

00:45:31.318 --> 00:45:33.090
the fact that the Soviet
transformation is over,

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:35.790
and you have this shift
from economics to culture,

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:37.560
means that the whole nature

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.300
of the way the Soviets are
gonna define themselves

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.340
against the West is now
a little bit different.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.210
It has much more to do with a
notion of cultural innocence.

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:47.400
So when Zhdanov says there are two camps,

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.620
he means we are the good guys

00:45:49.620 --> 00:45:51.960
and the capitalists are the bad guys.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.840
The capitalists who were
our allies a moment ago

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.797
now turn out to be fascists.

00:45:57.797 --> 00:46:00.630
And by the way, the dance
that the Americans do

00:46:00.630 --> 00:46:02.670
is almost as extraordinary, right?

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.760
I mean Stalin's on the cover
of Life Magazine in 1943

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.590
and there's a whole special
issue which I have in my office,

00:46:10.590 --> 00:46:14.220
come to office hours, it'd
be great to see you guys,

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:15.630
but there's a whole special issue

00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:18.390
about how wonderful the
great Russian people are

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:19.740
and how they're the leader

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.330
of all the peoples of the Soviet Union

00:46:21.330 --> 00:46:23.370
and how the great Russian
people are just like America.

00:46:23.370 --> 00:46:24.240
It's really interesting

00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.890
if you're in American studies

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.720
because it's just like America,

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.760
like the Russians are just
like the white people,

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.600
like they're in charge.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.310
And look, there's some
pictures of people of color

00:46:32.310 --> 00:46:33.300
and they're kind of subordinate,

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.190
but they like being ruled
by these white people,

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:38.100
the Russians, who are just
like the American white people.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:38.940
But the point is

00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.300
that the Americans also
had to make this turn

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.000
where they went from being
the allies of the Soviet Union

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:48.570
who were all Democrats in
the sense of small D right,

00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.406
Hollywood was in on this.

00:46:50.406 --> 00:46:51.239
There were great movies
about how the Soviets

00:46:51.239 --> 00:46:52.470
were the greatest democracy in the world.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:53.760
We had this shift from nought to Cold War

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.110
in just a few years.

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:59.340
Okay, but the way the
Soviets do it is they say,

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.640
this is all, you know, this is
fundamentally about fascism.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.770
the fascists or who we say they are,

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:06.780
but here's the important point.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.570
The important point is
that this then becomes

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.700
about cultural innocence.

00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:16.700
And the lodestone of what's
special about the Soviet Union

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:19.500
is no longer the economic transformation.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:23.610
That's happened, it turned
out to be a bit of a dud,

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:24.960
can't really say so.

00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.880
The lodestone of what's
special about the Soviet Union

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:29.220
is now much more Russian culture.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.510
And Zhdanov,

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:33.260
the same fellow who gives us
this whole two camps idea,

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:38.070
is also responsible for a cultural policy

00:47:38.070 --> 00:47:40.260
in which the idea is that Russian culture

00:47:40.260 --> 00:47:41.790
is basically good culture

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:44.550
so long as it's not contaminated
by outside influences.

00:47:44.550 --> 00:47:49.020
And the Russian writers and
poets who are then persecuted

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:51.780
are persecuted because they've
allowed alien influences,

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:56.010
cosmopolitan influences
into Russian literature.

00:47:56.010 --> 00:47:58.350
And on this account of
the way the world works,

00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:01.680
naturally, Ukrainian culture
is going to be downgraded

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.750
because Ukrainian culture
is closer to the west,

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:04.740
it's been contaminated

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:07.765
most recently by German occupation, right?

00:48:07.765 --> 00:48:10.515
And so this becomes another
way that Russia is elevated

00:48:11.813 --> 00:48:13.350
as against Ukraine.

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.540
And I just want to just
give you one little thought

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:17.640
about what this four ordains.

00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:18.600
We're not there yet.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.340
Okay, Stalin's still in power,

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.620
it's now the early 1950s, let's say,

00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:23.910
and we're not there yet,

00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:27.630
but we're now going to be
reach into the question of,

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.580
well, if this is all about cultures

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.750
and Russian culture

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.400
is the one that's central
and pure and important

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.260
and Ukraine is kind of
a little bit defiled

00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:37.500
and on the outside, what is Ukraine?

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:39.030
Khrushchev has an answer to that.

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:39.930
Khrushchev's answer,

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:40.980
and we'll talk about this next time,

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:44.040
is Ukraine is a slightly
less important culture,

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.170
which always wanted to join Russia.

00:48:46.170 --> 00:48:50.310
So it exists but the
point of its existence

00:48:50.310 --> 00:48:51.780
was to join Russia, right?

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.450
Which is an elegant answer
and is taken up by many people

00:48:54.450 --> 00:48:56.640
and it becomes very popular.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.070
And then Brezhnev will
have another answer,

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:02.220
which is that now that
Ukraine has joined Russia

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.070
de facto and forever,

00:49:05.070 --> 00:49:06.690
culture, it's going to become something

00:49:06.690 --> 00:49:07.950
which is much less important,

00:49:07.950 --> 00:49:09.120
culture is just going to become something

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.627
that you have at home.

00:49:10.627 --> 00:49:11.768
The Ukrainian language will be something

00:49:11.768 --> 00:49:12.960
that maybe you have at
home or on the countryside,

00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:15.480
but the Soviet Union is gonna be run

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.370
as a kind of very efficient technical

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:18.600
administrative apparatus

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.550
in which Russian is going
to be the neutral language

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:23.130
that everyone's going to use
and everyone's going to know.

00:49:23.130 --> 00:49:27.960
So Khrushchev and Brezhnev
have different answers

00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.970
about what Ukraine is going
to be within the Soviet Union,

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:31.170
we'll spend more time on them.

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:34.080
But at the base is this is
this thing which happens

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:36.600
during the second world
war, which is that Ukraine,

00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:38.940
precisely because Ukraine
is under occupation

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:40.560
and Ukrainians suffer more,

00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.520
has to be presented as
contaminated and dangerous,

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.280
and precisely because the
economic transformation is over

00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:49.770
and there's a shift now towards culture,

00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:52.950
there's the potential for
a shift towards nostalgia,

00:49:52.950 --> 00:49:55.560
where the Soviet Union
is gonna become with time

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.240
not just more about culture and economics,

00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:58.710
but more about the past

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:02.370
than about the present
or the future, right?

00:50:02.370 --> 00:50:04.800
By the time we get to Brezhnev,

00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:06.240
the cult of the Second World War

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.900
will have replaced the revolution

00:50:08.858 --> 00:50:11.670
as the central focus of the
Soviet Union as a whole.

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:12.870
And if everything's about the past

00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:15.870
and if everything's about nostalgia,

00:50:15.870 --> 00:50:18.420
then you're setting
yourself up for actually,

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.090
you know, a very right
wing view of the world.

00:50:21.090 --> 00:50:22.380
And then the process that you get

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:24.510
when the Soviet Union falls
apart and you get to today

00:50:24.510 --> 00:50:25.650
becomes less mysterious.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:27.420
Okay, trying to do a lot today.

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:28.500
Hope it came through.

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:29.500
Thank you very much.

00:50:34.999 --> 00:50:37.666
(gentle music)

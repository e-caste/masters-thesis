00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.322
Professor Donald
Kagan: I'm going to talk to

00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:11.068
you today about the beginnings
of the Greek experience as far

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:14.470
as we know it,
and I should warn you at once

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.375
that the further back in history
you go the less secure is your

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:24.122
knowledge, especially at the
beginning of our talk today when

00:00:24.122 --> 00:00:27.920
you are in a truly prehistoric
period.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.496
That is before there is any
written evidence from the period

00:00:34.496 --> 00:00:39.767
in which you are interested.
So what we think we know

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:43.220
derives chiefly from
archeological evidence,

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.397
which is before writing--mute
evidence that has to be

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:50.690
interpreted and is very
complicated,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.090
and is far from secure.
Even a question such as a date

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.494
which is so critical for
historians, is really quite

00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:03.124
approximate,
and subject to controversy,

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:08.140
as is just about every single
thing I will tell you for the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.129
next few days.
These will be even more than

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:14.007
usual subject to controversy
even the most fundamental

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.974
things.
So what you'll be hearing are

00:01:16.974 --> 00:01:21.989
approximations as best we can
make them of what's going on.

00:01:21.989 --> 00:01:28.643
Well, we begin our story
with the emergence of the Bronze

00:01:28.643 --> 00:01:34.698
Age in the Aegean Sea area.
That appears to have taken

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:39.533
place about 3000 B.C.
I think these days they date it

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:42.830
down about another century to
about 2900.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.180
Precision is impossible;
don't worry about that.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.762
And what we find,
the first example of a Bronze

00:01:49.762 --> 00:01:53.889
Age--and I use the word
civilization now for the first

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:56.404
time,
because before the Bronze

00:01:56.404 --> 00:02:00.760
Age--there is nothing that we
would define as civilization.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.819
Civilization involves the
establishment of permanent

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.870
dwelling areas that we call
cities, as opposed to villages.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.366
Agricultural villages will have
existed all over the place in

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:17.872
the late Stone Age,
in the Neolithic Period,

00:02:17.872 --> 00:02:21.392
as it is known.
But there is a difference and

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:26.217
the critical difference is that
a city contains a number of

00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:30.460
people who do not provide for
their own support.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.139
That is to say,
they don't produce food.

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:36.690
They need to acquire it from
somebody else.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.630
Instead, they do various things
like govern and are priests,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.949
and are bureaucrats,
and are engaged in other

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:48.879
non-productive activities that
depend upon others to feed them.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.235
That's the narrowest definition
of cities.Of course,

00:02:53.235 --> 00:02:57.986
with cities we typically find a
whole association of cultural

00:02:57.986 --> 00:03:02.560
characteristics,
which we deem civilization.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.300
Well, that's what we see for
the first time in the Aegean

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.824
area on the island of Crete.
That civilization was uncovered

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:15.665
by the archaeologists right at
the beginning of the twentieth

00:03:15.665 --> 00:03:17.515
century.
Sir Arthur Evans,

00:03:17.515 --> 00:03:20.414
an Englishman,
was responsible for the major

00:03:20.414 --> 00:03:23.379
work that has revealed that
civilization.

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.738
He was captivated by it,
he--at one point I think he

00:03:27.738 --> 00:03:33.037
convinced himself that he was a
descendant of the kings of that

00:03:33.037 --> 00:03:37.129
civilization.
But in any case, he named it.

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.024
He named it after the legendary
King of Crete who appears in

00:03:42.024 --> 00:03:45.259
Greek mythology by the name of
Minos.

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:49.877
So he referred to that
civilization as the Minoan

00:03:49.877 --> 00:03:53.814
civilization.
When we use the word Minoan we

00:03:53.814 --> 00:03:57.389
mean the civilization whose home
is Crete.

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:01.890
It spread out beyond Crete
because the Minoans established

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.548
what we might want to call an
empire in various parts of the

00:04:06.548 --> 00:04:12.050
Mediterranean,
and it starts with Crete.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.417
It is a Bronze Age culture,
and it is the first

00:04:15.417 --> 00:04:17.980
civilization we know in the
area.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:23.746
What we find in the Minoan
civilization--I mean the main

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:29.317
place we can learn about this
civilization was the city of

00:04:29.317 --> 00:04:33.076
Knossos,
located on the northern shore

00:04:33.076 --> 00:04:38.250
of Crete where a great palace
complex was discovered and is

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.401
available.
By the way it's an absolutely

00:04:41.401 --> 00:04:44.010
beautiful site,
a great tourist site;

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.089
you can see quite a lot there.
Anyway, when you examine that

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:54.675
site and draw the conclusions
that are inevitable from

00:04:54.675 --> 00:04:58.529
examining it,
and, also I should have said,

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:03.640
all of the Minoan settlements,
you realize that they look and

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.494
seem very much like older
civilizations that have grown up

00:05:08.494 --> 00:05:13.313
in the Ancient Near East.
The real sort of typical home

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:17.839
of the kinds of things were
talking about is Mesopotamia,

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:19.770
modern Iraq,
the Tigress,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.388
Euphrates Valley,
which spread out beyond Iraq

00:05:23.388 --> 00:05:27.410
and went up into Syria and
neighboring places.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.575
It, too, was very similar to
the civilization,

00:05:31.575 --> 00:05:36.574
but apparently a little bit
newer in the Nile Valley in

00:05:36.574 --> 00:05:39.028
Egypt,
about which we know a great

00:05:39.028 --> 00:05:41.860
deal more than we know about the
Minoans because,

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.023
as you know,
in the nineteenth century,

00:05:45.023 --> 00:05:50.185
scholars discovered how to read
the languages that were written

00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:54.473
in Egypt and in Mesopotamia.
So, they were able to develop

00:05:54.473 --> 00:05:57.666
something approaching history
for the period we're talking

00:05:57.666 --> 00:06:00.788
about.
That is not true for Crete

00:06:00.788 --> 00:06:06.026
because, although they had a
script--and we have available to

00:06:06.026 --> 00:06:11.350
us tablets with those writings
on them--to this day no one has

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:15.889
deciphered the language written
by the Minoans.

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.740
Therefore, we don't have that
kind of knowledge.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.201
So barring that,
nonetheless,

00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:26.389
what we see reminds us very
much of these ancient Bronze Age

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.338
early civilizations.
So, this will be significant as

00:06:31.338 --> 00:06:35.641
we talk about how the Greeks
differed from them,

00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:41.940
which gets us to the Greeks.
The Minoans are not Greeks.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.387
Strictly speaking,
what do we mean when we say

00:06:45.387 --> 00:06:48.364
somebody is Greek?
We mean that his native

00:06:48.364 --> 00:06:51.442
language, not one that he's
acquired subsequently,

00:06:51.442 --> 00:06:54.079
but the one that he learned as
a child,

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:59.410
was Greek, some version of the
Greek language.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.009
These are linguistic terms.
But of course,

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:06.045
the people who spoke them,
especially in the early years,

00:07:06.045 --> 00:07:09.865
tended to be part of a
relatively narrow collection of

00:07:09.865 --> 00:07:12.149
people,
who intermarried with each

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:14.551
other chiefly,
and therefore developed common

00:07:14.551 --> 00:07:17.079
cultural characteristics.
So of course,

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:21.138
the language is only a clue.
When you speak about Greeks you

00:07:21.138 --> 00:07:24.794
will be speaking about something
more than merely the fact that

00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:28.557
they spoke a certain language.
In the nineteenth century,

00:07:28.557 --> 00:07:30.800
there was a lot of talk about
races.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:33.866
There were people who spoke
about the Greek race,

00:07:33.866 --> 00:07:36.741
or similar races,
for quite a long time in the

00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:40.000
science of anthropology and
subjects like that.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.259
It's been determined that those
terms are inappropriate.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:47.261
They suggest there is something
in the genes that explains the

00:07:47.261 --> 00:07:49.820
characteristics of particular
people;

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.870
that is certainly not true.
So let's understand each other.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:57.825
We're talking about a culture
when we're talking about the

00:07:57.825 --> 00:08:02.128
Greeks, which is most strikingly
signified by the language that

00:08:02.128 --> 00:08:05.412
is spoken.
Well, the way we can reason

00:08:05.412 --> 00:08:09.068
things out from the evidence we
have suggests that

00:08:09.068 --> 00:08:13.768
Greek-speaking peoples came down
into the area around the Aegean

00:08:13.768 --> 00:08:16.328
Sea,
perhaps around 2000 B.C.,

00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:20.861
about a thousand years later
than the emergence of the Minoan

00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:25.075
civilization at Crete.
And again, I think these days

00:08:25.075 --> 00:08:29.083
they tend to down date it by
another century or so,

00:08:29.083 --> 00:08:34.927
so it might be around 1900 B.C.
We really don't know very much

00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:38.460
about these early Greek
settlers.

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:43.433
We begin to know more about
three or four hundred years down

00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:48.407
the road, when there appear
buildings and settlements in the

00:08:48.407 --> 00:08:51.779
world later inhabited by the
Greeks,

00:08:51.779 --> 00:08:58.370
as we know, to which we give
the name Mycenaean.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.384
Now, that derives from one
site in the northeastern

00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:08.019
Peloponnesus called Mycenae,
and the name is given because

00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:10.952
in the poems of Homer,
the Iliad and the

00:09:10.952 --> 00:09:14.094
Odyssey,
the leading Greek king,

00:09:14.094 --> 00:09:18.690
the man who is the leader of
the expedition to Troy,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.903
is Agamemnon,
who was king of the Argolid

00:09:22.903 --> 00:09:28.379
region and his palace and his
home are at Mycenae,

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:31.972
and that's why we call the
entire culture,

00:09:31.972 --> 00:09:36.266
the Bronze Age culture,
running from about 1600 to

00:09:36.266 --> 00:09:40.899
perhaps as late as 1100,
but perhaps not so late.

00:09:40.899 --> 00:09:44.455
That's what we mean when we
speak about the Mycenaeans and

00:09:44.455 --> 00:09:48.151
the Mycenaean Period.
And please keep in mind that

00:09:48.151 --> 00:09:51.756
they are Greek speakers;
and we know this with

00:09:51.756 --> 00:09:56.213
confidence, something we didn't
know at the beginning of the

00:09:56.213 --> 00:10:00.473
twentieth century,
because written evidence is

00:10:00.473 --> 00:10:06.216
available on a bunch of clay
tablets that were accidentally

00:10:06.216 --> 00:10:10.870
baked in some conflagration in
these places.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.735
The same thing is true of
Knossos in Crete,

00:10:14.735 --> 00:10:18.179
and perhaps a few other sites
in Crete.

00:10:18.179 --> 00:10:21.735
Not at the same time,
but the reason we have any

00:10:21.735 --> 00:10:25.745
written evidence at all is that
there was some kind of

00:10:25.745 --> 00:10:29.830
conflagration that produced a
fire that baked clay into

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.887
pottery.
In the normal course of events,

00:10:32.887 --> 00:10:36.365
clay dissolves and disappears,
and any message on it is

00:10:36.365 --> 00:10:38.000
erased.
In other words,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.369
this was not meant to be a
record to be left for the

00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:43.230
future.
It was an accident.

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:49.369
These things that we discovered
were meant for a practical usage

00:10:49.369 --> 00:10:54.730
in ways that I will tell you
about in a little while.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:00.409
So, anyway, that writing--let
me back up a step.

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:04.868
When Evans found writing at
Knossos, he found two--well,

00:11:04.868 --> 00:11:09.327
he actually found seven,
but only two that turned out to

00:11:09.327 --> 00:11:12.570
be significant--two kinds of
script.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.995
I shouldn't even say script;
that sounds like he's writing a

00:11:15.995 --> 00:11:20.669
nice cursive line.
There were two kinds of writing.

00:11:20.669 --> 00:11:24.579
Because he couldn't figure out
what they were,

00:11:24.579 --> 00:11:28.750
he called one Linear A and the
other Linear B,

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.256
because he could tell by
careful analysis that they were

00:11:32.256 --> 00:11:36.210
different, and he could tell
which pieces belonged to which.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:41.300
Linear A is earlier and it
is associated with and it is

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.478
clearly the language used by the
Minoan kings at Knossos and

00:11:46.478 --> 00:11:49.976
other places.
Linear B resembles Linear A,

00:11:49.976 --> 00:11:54.275
but it is clearly different and
later, and one reason we know

00:11:54.275 --> 00:11:57.070
that comes mostly from
stratigraphy,

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:01.641
but we can also tell because
it's a much simpler script,

00:12:01.641 --> 00:12:05.840
but by no means simple.
These are not alphabets;

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:10.847
these are syllabaries,
every symbol represents a

00:12:10.847 --> 00:12:12.947
syllable;
in other words,

00:12:12.947 --> 00:12:15.360
typically two letters rather
than one.

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.267
That's a nice step over having
loads, and loads,

00:12:19.267 --> 00:12:23.175
and loads of symbols
representing lots of things

00:12:23.175 --> 00:12:27.250
which is true more of Linear A
than Linear B,

00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.561
but it's still--we're talking
about something approaching

00:12:30.561 --> 00:12:34.346
sixty symbols in a syllabary and
when you think about how hard it

00:12:34.346 --> 00:12:38.250
is to learn to read when you're
only using twenty-six symbols,

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.608
and how few Americans do learn
to read, which I keep reading in

00:12:42.608 --> 00:12:45.140
the paper--it's not an easy
thing.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:49.477
It's not a simple matter.
Imagine what it would be like

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.879
if you had to learn about sixty
such things?

00:12:51.879 --> 00:12:55.269
Well, of course,
what follows from all of that

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:59.609
is that ordinary people did not.
What we learn ultimately

00:12:59.609 --> 00:13:03.740
from our decipherment of Linear
B--which I've just skipped over,

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:08.045
which was done in the 1950's by
a brilliant young architect,

00:13:08.045 --> 00:13:11.110
who loved solving problems of
this kind,

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:17.009
he was able to discover that
this was an early form of Greek

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:22.409
and that he could essentially
make out what it said.

00:13:22.409 --> 00:13:26.041
At first there was doubt and
controversy, which has

00:13:26.041 --> 00:13:29.599
completely gone away,
as more and more examples of

00:13:29.599 --> 00:13:33.521
this writing have become
available and scholars are now

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.608
able,
by and large,

00:13:35.608 --> 00:13:40.960
to be confident that they know
what these things say.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:46.034
So, the fact that this was a
Greek script that was available

00:13:46.034 --> 00:13:50.937
in the Mycenaean Period tells us
very confidently that the

00:13:50.937 --> 00:13:54.766
Mycenaeans were Greeks.
But of course,

00:13:54.766 --> 00:14:00.467
a lot was known about these
Mycenaeans well before the

00:14:00.467 --> 00:14:05.262
syllabary was deciphered.
It's worth saying a word

00:14:05.262 --> 00:14:09.017
about that, because I want to
undermine any great confidence

00:14:09.017 --> 00:14:12.837
that you may have and what you
can believe that scholars tell

00:14:12.837 --> 00:14:15.392
you,
because we keep finding out how

00:14:15.392 --> 00:14:17.950
wrong we are about all kinds of
things.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:20.574
I would say,
if you walked into the leading

00:14:20.574 --> 00:14:24.135
universities in the world,
there would probably be Germans

00:14:24.135 --> 00:14:27.509
in the 1850's and you went to
the classics people,

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:30.585
and you said,
"well, you know Homer wrote

00:14:30.585 --> 00:14:34.200
about these places,
Mycenae and other places,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.029
can you tell me where that was?"
They would say,

00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:40.017
"You silly fellow,
that's just stories,

00:14:40.017 --> 00:14:42.769
that's mythology,
that's poetry.

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:47.027
There never was an Agamemnon,
there never was a Mycenae,

00:14:47.027 --> 00:14:50.493
there isn't any such thing."
Then in 1870,

00:14:50.493 --> 00:14:55.331
a German businessman by the
name of Heinrich Schliemann,

00:14:55.331 --> 00:15:00.257
who had not had the benefit of
a university education and

00:15:00.257 --> 00:15:04.919
didn't know what a fool and how
ignorant he was,

00:15:04.919 --> 00:15:07.368
believed Homer,
and he said he wanted to look

00:15:07.368 --> 00:15:09.971
for Troy.
So, he went to where people

00:15:09.971 --> 00:15:13.659
thought Troy might be and he
began digging there,

00:15:13.659 --> 00:15:17.970
and before you know it,
he discovered a mound filled

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.519
with cities, which he believed
was Troy.

00:15:21.519 --> 00:15:25.584
And after the usual amount of
scholarly debate,

00:15:25.584 --> 00:15:30.710
there seems to be no doubt that
it was the City of Troy.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.667
So having succeeded with that,
he thought well,

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:36.559
now that I've seen Troy,
how about Mycenae?

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:40.165
Off he went to the northeast
Peloponnesus to the site where

00:15:40.165 --> 00:15:42.980
he thought it might be,
Mycenae, from Homer's

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.679
account--I wouldn't be telling
you this story,

00:15:45.679 --> 00:15:49.485
and you know the outcome.
He found it and it was the

00:15:49.485 --> 00:15:54.064
excavation of the site of
Mycenae which was soon followed

00:15:54.064 --> 00:15:59.133
by the excavation of other sites
from the same period that made

00:15:59.133 --> 00:16:03.629
it possible for people to talk
about this culture,

00:16:03.629 --> 00:16:07.899
even before they could read the
script.

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:13.090
The culture is marked by
some of the following features.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.185
Let's take Mycenae,
which is maybe the best example

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:19.861
of the whole culture.
Certainly, it's a perfect model

00:16:19.861 --> 00:16:24.615
for what we're talking about.
What you have to begin with is

00:16:24.615 --> 00:16:28.478
a town or a city,
or a settlement of some kind

00:16:28.478 --> 00:16:33.408
built on top of a hill,
and it's usually intended to be

00:16:33.408 --> 00:16:37.413
a formidable hill,
one not easily accessible to

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:42.105
anybody who comes walking along,
a place, in other words,

00:16:42.105 --> 00:16:45.190
that would make a very nice
fort, a citadel.

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:49.330
That's, indeed,
what we find at Mycenae.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.349
On that citadel,
on that strongly,

00:16:52.349 --> 00:16:57.198
rocky fort or citadel,
they built what we now identify

00:16:57.198 --> 00:17:01.590
as the royal palace,
the palace of the king.

00:17:06.029 --> 00:17:11.494
That was, I should point out,
maybe about ten miles from the

00:17:11.494 --> 00:17:14.559
sea.
Now, not all Mycenaean sites

00:17:14.559 --> 00:17:18.399
are so far from the sea;
some of them are closer,

00:17:18.399 --> 00:17:22.397
but what it's important to say
is that none of them are right

00:17:22.397 --> 00:17:25.938
on the sea.
They're always back some few

00:17:25.938 --> 00:17:28.843
miles.
The reason for that I think is

00:17:28.843 --> 00:17:33.201
that the early times in which
these civilizations arose saw

00:17:33.201 --> 00:17:37.400
all kinds of dangers coming,
and the most--the swiftest,

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.725
the least suspected,
the one that could come upon

00:17:40.725 --> 00:17:45.121
you overnight came from the sea.
People who came by land you

00:17:45.121 --> 00:17:49.191
would be hearing rumblings about
down the road from villages that

00:17:49.191 --> 00:17:51.781
were spread out,
but if somebody comes in from

00:17:51.781 --> 00:17:54.068
the sea on a ship,
you may find them there in the

00:17:54.068 --> 00:17:56.069
morning and you don't know
what's what.

00:17:56.069 --> 00:17:59.556
So the idea for security and
safety, they built their estates

00:17:59.556 --> 00:18:03.615
far from the sea,
but not far because as we shall

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:09.526
see the Mycenaean civilization
was a commercial one that relied

00:18:09.526 --> 00:18:14.960
for its wealth upon trade and
that meant trade by sea,

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:21.043
more than by land.
The citadel is always

00:18:21.043 --> 00:18:25.392
surrounded by farmland,
and, of course,

00:18:25.392 --> 00:18:30.885
you cannot live in ancient
society if you are not

00:18:30.885 --> 00:18:36.794
surrounded by farmland,
because the food that comes

00:18:36.794 --> 00:18:42.602
from the soil is essential for
life, and you can't count on

00:18:42.602 --> 00:18:47.410
trade to provide it to you with
any security.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.326
Later on when times are more
secure, there's trade for grain

00:18:50.326 --> 00:18:52.920
as well for everything else,
but when you're settling a

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.099
place in the first place,
you can't rely on somebody

00:18:55.099 --> 00:18:57.490
bringing it to you.
You're going to have your own

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.640
people working it,
and bringing it up to you

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.710
themselves.
So, the citadel and the

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:08.275
farmland surrounding it,
make up fundamentally the unit

00:19:08.275 --> 00:19:14.702
which is the Mycenaean kingdom.
Well, the first thing that

00:19:14.702 --> 00:19:20.351
Schliemann found when he dug at
Mycenae was this remarkable

00:19:20.351 --> 00:19:24.818
circle of graves,
which were shafts dug straight

00:19:24.818 --> 00:19:28.680
down into the soil,
and they are referred to,

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.463
to this day,
technically as shaft graves,

00:19:31.463 --> 00:19:35.640
and then in other places not
very far from that main hill,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:41.242
they found even more remarkable
burials, what we call beehive

00:19:41.242 --> 00:19:44.427
tombs.
Just imagine a huge beehive,

00:19:44.427 --> 00:19:48.432
in which let's say,
the center of the inside of

00:19:48.432 --> 00:19:52.960
that might be as much as fifty
feet high or more,

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.407
and these were built of
extraordinarily huge,

00:19:58.407 --> 00:20:03.360
heavy stones and very well
worked too.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:07.482
Here's the marvelous thing.
The reason he had to uncover it

00:20:07.482 --> 00:20:10.255
was that beehive tombs,
like everything else,

00:20:10.255 --> 00:20:13.350
were buried.
This wasn't just the results of

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:16.609
centuries of neglect,
it is clear that they were

00:20:16.609 --> 00:20:19.809
built in order to be buried.
That is to say,

00:20:19.809 --> 00:20:23.660
it was some kind of a big
religious thing going on here,

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.369
where the king--it was
obviously a royal thing because

00:20:27.369 --> 00:20:32.135
the cost of it was so enormous;
nobody else could afford a tomb

00:20:32.135 --> 00:20:35.121
of that kind.
So, here was a royal tomb

00:20:35.121 --> 00:20:40.089
closed forever and yet built at
a fantastic expense and enormous

00:20:40.089 --> 00:20:42.930
kind of labor.
The same is true in a

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.470
general way of what we find in
the royal palace up on top of

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.882
the hill at Mycenae,
and so what is perfectly clear

00:20:49.882 --> 00:20:54.150
is the people who ruled these
places were enormously powerful,

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:59.407
at least locally, and wealthy.
Even if you imagine that slaves

00:20:59.407 --> 00:21:02.220
did the work,
you would need a hell of a lot

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.729
of them,
over a long period of time,

00:21:04.729 --> 00:21:07.579
and you had to feed them,
if nothing else.

00:21:07.579 --> 00:21:10.845
So, we are talking about a
wealthy group,

00:21:10.845 --> 00:21:13.703
and of course,
the thing that struck

00:21:13.703 --> 00:21:18.520
Schliemann almost amazingly was
that in the circle of graves

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:24.966
that we've been talking about,
he found all kinds of precious

00:21:24.966 --> 00:21:29.659
things buried.
The most striking of which were

00:21:29.659 --> 00:21:35.160
death masks made of pure gold on
the remains of the body,

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.255
but also jewels,
and implements,

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:41.750
and weapons of very high
expense.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.918
That's what,
of course, makes it clear they

00:21:43.918 --> 00:21:47.313
were royal;
by the way, there are only a

00:21:47.313 --> 00:21:52.079
few of these graves over a large
period of time.

00:21:52.079 --> 00:21:57.474
So, you must imagine these are
successive kings who are being

00:21:57.474 --> 00:22:00.621
buried in this,
what must have been,

00:22:00.621 --> 00:22:04.670
sacred soil.
So, that makes it clear we're

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:07.910
talking about a wealthy
civilization,

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:11.869
at least in which the rulers
are wealthy,

00:22:11.869 --> 00:22:16.549
and in which the rulers,
of course, are very powerful.

00:22:16.549 --> 00:22:22.140
Now, what we learn,
both from archaeology and from

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:26.992
references in the Linear B
tablets is that they

00:22:26.992 --> 00:22:32.898
engaged--these cultures engaged
in trade to a significant

00:22:32.898 --> 00:22:36.674
degree.
You find Mycenaean elements,

00:22:36.674 --> 00:22:40.538
tools, other things,
pottery particularly of a

00:22:40.538 --> 00:22:44.660
certain kind,
all over the Mediterranean Sea.

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:49.325
You find it in datable places
and that's why we can give this

00:22:49.325 --> 00:22:52.279
some kind of date,
such as in Egypt.

00:22:52.279 --> 00:22:54.789
The Mycenaeans had regular
trade with Egypt.

00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:58.624
We find Egyptian things in
Mycenae and vice versa,

00:22:58.624 --> 00:23:02.537
and also presumably,
much of it must have gone into

00:23:02.537 --> 00:23:05.432
Mesopotamia;
some of it went all the way to

00:23:05.432 --> 00:23:09.078
the Western Mediterranean.
This was a civilization that

00:23:09.078 --> 00:23:13.028
was not shut in on itself,
but was in touch with the

00:23:13.028 --> 00:23:18.612
entire Mediterranean region.
The major thing they seem to be

00:23:18.612 --> 00:23:23.130
selling were aromatic oils in
little vials.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:31.170
Think of them as some
combination of oil and perfume.

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.635
I better say something about
oil in the ancient world,

00:23:34.635 --> 00:23:37.839
so that you get a grip on
what's going on here.

00:23:37.839 --> 00:23:42.540
The ancient Greeks had no
soap.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:47.730
Think about that for a moment.
That's a problem, isn't it?

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:53.798
Yet, they wanted to get clean
and so what device they used was

00:23:53.798 --> 00:23:57.279
to take oil, typically olive
oil,

00:23:57.279 --> 00:24:01.131
spread it on themselves,
then get a scrapper,

00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:05.158
a metal scrapper,
and scrap off the oil with it

00:24:05.158 --> 00:24:09.102
what was underneath the oil.
And then finally,

00:24:09.102 --> 00:24:12.865
they would take their bath and
out they would come and be

00:24:12.865 --> 00:24:17.790
clean.
Now, oil is a wonderful thing;

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:21.960
olive oil is a great thing.
In certain forms you eat it.

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:25.480
The olive itself,
you use it to cook with as oil;

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.980
some people just put oil on
their salad.

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.853
I, myself, can't stand it
but--the point is-- but that's

00:24:31.853 --> 00:24:34.152
not all.
If you get oil,

00:24:34.152 --> 00:24:39.709
crush the oil from the olives
that come down from the trees,

00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:43.099
that's a nasty smell that it
has.

00:24:43.099 --> 00:24:45.848
So if you're going to use it
for this purpose,

00:24:45.848 --> 00:24:48.170
it's not going to be good by
itself.

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:51.221
You've got to put some nice
perfume onto it,

00:24:51.221 --> 00:24:55.195
in order for it to be useable,
just as your soap would be

00:24:55.195 --> 00:24:58.460
pretty horrible without any
perfume on it.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.781
So it looks as though what the
Mycenaeans did--Greece is filled

00:25:03.781 --> 00:25:08.931
with wonderful olive trees and
so they obviously took the oil

00:25:08.931 --> 00:25:12.179
from those olives.
I'm sure they sold it in

00:25:12.179 --> 00:25:14.727
various forms,
but one of the most popular was

00:25:14.727 --> 00:25:17.140
for this purpose.
Everybody in the

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.957
Mediterranean wanted it for the
same reasons,

00:25:19.957 --> 00:25:23.671
and obviously these Mycenaean
sites had access to what they

00:25:23.671 --> 00:25:25.376
needed.
It looks like,

00:25:25.376 --> 00:25:29.055
by the way, that they got much
of the perfume from areas

00:25:29.055 --> 00:25:32.829
outside of Greece.
Some of the best of it came

00:25:32.829 --> 00:25:36.690
from northeast Africa,
as a matter of fact.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:39.940
You remember the Queen of Sheba
from the Bible?

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:45.065
I say that, but I shutter to
think how many of you have read

00:25:45.065 --> 00:25:49.562
the Bible, but anyway,
she was so rich as to attract

00:25:49.562 --> 00:25:54.138
the interest of King Solomon,
because that's where those

00:25:54.138 --> 00:25:57.071
wonderful,
fine smelling things,

00:25:57.071 --> 00:26:01.128
frankincense and myrrh,
and stuff like that was

00:26:01.128 --> 00:26:04.480
available--useful for this
purpose.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:10.115
So they had to import that to
make their goods as saleable as

00:26:10.115 --> 00:26:13.983
they wanted and so on.
So you have trade with the

00:26:13.983 --> 00:26:16.714
Mediterranean and most
especially the eastern

00:26:16.714 --> 00:26:19.613
Mediterranean,
because that's where the older,

00:26:19.613 --> 00:26:22.408
more sophisticated,
more civilized cultures were

00:26:22.408 --> 00:26:25.922
and that's where wealth was too,
compared to what was out in the

00:26:25.922 --> 00:26:28.754
west.
So, that's also the pattern of

00:26:28.754 --> 00:26:31.901
trade.
What you see is a kind of

00:26:31.901 --> 00:26:34.364
cultural unity,
first of all,

00:26:34.364 --> 00:26:37.619
within the Mycenaean world
itself.

00:26:37.619 --> 00:26:41.572
It is evident that these
different Mycenaean towns,

00:26:41.572 --> 00:26:46.157
all throughout the Greek world,
on both sides of the Aegean

00:26:46.157 --> 00:26:49.240
Sea, were in touch with each
other.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:52.768
One of the things that's
interesting about that is you

00:26:52.768 --> 00:26:56.695
can see pottery styles that you
can hardly tell whether they

00:26:56.695 --> 00:27:00.289
came from one end of the
Mediterranean or another,

00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:05.454
if they're of the Mycenaean
variety, because it was a single

00:27:05.454 --> 00:27:08.259
culture.
I don't mean there were no

00:27:08.259 --> 00:27:11.451
local variations,
but there was this general

00:27:11.451 --> 00:27:14.339
unity.
I'm going to contrast that with

00:27:14.339 --> 00:27:18.849
the situation in Greece after
the fall of the Mycenaean world,

00:27:18.849 --> 00:27:22.279
and I was going to say not just
in the Mycenaean towns

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:26.355
themselves, but over the entire
Aegean Sea and indeed across the

00:27:26.355 --> 00:27:30.641
Mediterranean.
In the years of the Mycenaean

00:27:30.641 --> 00:27:35.377
Period, roughly from 1600 to
1100 or so B.C.,

00:27:35.377 --> 00:27:40.760
you are dealing with a largely
unified culture.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.322
What is it?
What do we talk about the world

00:27:44.322 --> 00:27:47.150
like these days?
What's the cliché?

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.896
Globalized world;
it was a globalized world,

00:27:49.896 --> 00:27:52.089
except it was a little piece of
the globe.

00:27:52.089 --> 00:27:57.161
But they didn't really know or
care about very much outside of

00:27:57.161 --> 00:28:01.129
the Mediterranean area.
Now, in the respects that I

00:28:01.129 --> 00:28:03.811
have spelled out,
and I mean chiefly the fact

00:28:03.811 --> 00:28:07.102
that they were engaged in
commerce and industry to some

00:28:07.102 --> 00:28:10.454
degree and that they were a
trading people and that they

00:28:10.454 --> 00:28:13.380
were in touch with one another
and so on,

00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:18.442
they were already similar to
the civilizations that came

00:28:18.442 --> 00:28:23.319
before them in the ancient
Mediterranean Near East.

00:28:23.319 --> 00:28:26.359
In those places,
in Egypt, the Pharaoh,

00:28:26.359 --> 00:28:30.680
and in Mesopotamia at first
individual city states were

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.000
ruled in the same way as
everybody else I'm going to be

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.366
talking about now,
by somebody who is a king,

00:28:40.366 --> 00:28:46.331
a monarch, a one-man ruler who
is the warlord,

00:28:46.331 --> 00:28:52.723
commander of the armies,
who has the control of the

00:28:52.723 --> 00:28:56.836
power in the state,
but more than that,

00:28:56.836 --> 00:29:03.546
all the economic activity that
we find--and our best example of

00:29:03.546 --> 00:29:09.606
what I'm about to say is in
Mesopotamia--in the cities of

00:29:09.606 --> 00:29:14.900
Tigress-Euphrates Valley.
The ruler there,

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:19.705
from his palace,
assisted by vast groups of

00:29:19.705 --> 00:29:27.369
bureaucrats directed the economy
of his land entirely and fully.

00:29:27.369 --> 00:29:30.939
Agriculture was overwhelmingly
the activity,

00:29:30.939 --> 00:29:35.421
the most important activity of
the people of that area,

00:29:35.421 --> 00:29:39.824
of any area.
So, we have evidence that

00:29:39.824 --> 00:29:46.079
the king doled out seed for
planting, instructed people just

00:29:46.079 --> 00:29:49.887
exactly when to plant,
where to plant,

00:29:49.887 --> 00:29:53.589
what to plant there,
when to fertilize it if they

00:29:53.589 --> 00:29:56.531
did.
In Mesopotamia they usually

00:29:56.531 --> 00:30:01.779
didn't need to because the
richness of the soil and so on.

00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:04.945
In other words,
you have a degree of

00:30:04.945 --> 00:30:09.104
centralized control of true,
monarchical power,

00:30:09.104 --> 00:30:14.880
of a wealthy monarchical power.
Already the model is there in

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.312
Asia.
Again, I want to say it's the

00:30:17.312 --> 00:30:20.900
same but in a special way in
Egypt, because in Egypt the

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.750
whole Nile Valley--because I
think of the nature of the Nile

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.359
Valley--became totally
centralized,

00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:29.567
under the rule of one man,
the Pharaoh,

00:30:29.567 --> 00:30:31.599
and he commanded the whole
thing.

00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:34.712
It took longer for anything
like that to happen in

00:30:34.712 --> 00:30:37.380
Mesopotamia, although it
ultimately did.

00:30:37.380 --> 00:30:39.359
When we get,
for instance,

00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:42.498
down to about 1750 B.C.
in Mesopotamia,

00:30:42.498 --> 00:30:46.823
Babylonia, which is at that
point the dominant kingdom of

00:30:46.823 --> 00:30:51.686
the area,
King Hammurabi has just about

00:30:51.686 --> 00:30:57.660
the same power as a Pharaoh
would in Egypt.

00:30:57.660 --> 00:31:05.218
It's also worth pointing
out that these rulers had full

00:31:05.218 --> 00:31:10.039
religious authority for their
rule.

00:31:10.039 --> 00:31:16.479
In the case of the Pharaohs of
Egypt, the Pharaoh was himself a

00:31:16.479 --> 00:31:21.880
god, and insisted on being
worshipped in that way.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.852
In Babylonia,
for instance,

00:31:23.852 --> 00:31:28.099
and this I think was typical,
Hammurabi was not a god,

00:31:28.099 --> 00:31:32.472
but as we know,
thank God, by the great steely

00:31:32.472 --> 00:31:36.650
that he left,
which is now in the Louvre.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:41.759
The law code of Hammurabi is
available to us and there's a

00:31:41.759 --> 00:31:46.331
preface to it in which he
basically explains why you

00:31:46.331 --> 00:31:51.799
should obey the rules that he
now is laying down for you.

00:31:51.799 --> 00:31:57.291
And his answer is because the
top god of our world,

00:31:57.291 --> 00:32:03.333
Marduk, appointed me in that
place and I'm doing what he

00:32:03.333 --> 00:32:07.903
wants me to do,
and if you cross me you cross

00:32:07.903 --> 00:32:11.310
him, and that's bad news.
That's a rough translation.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:21.310
So, this is very important.
You have a full monarchy in the

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:26.887
sense that both--we in America
talk about the separation of

00:32:26.887 --> 00:32:31.318
church and state,
that is a very rare and unusual

00:32:31.318 --> 00:32:34.150
thing in the history of the
world.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:38.898
The normal situation in
cultures pre-civilized and

00:32:38.898 --> 00:32:44.810
civilized as well is for there
to be a unity between religious

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:50.819
things and non-religious things,
and all of that to be ruled by

00:32:50.819 --> 00:32:55.857
a single individual who is the
monarch of that territory with

00:32:55.857 --> 00:33:00.140
religious sanction as well as
through his power,

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.160
and through the legitimacy of
his descent.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.250
That's the normal human way of
living.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:12.922
You should always be aware,
I think, about how peculiar we

00:33:12.922 --> 00:33:15.424
are.
We are the oddballs in the

00:33:15.424 --> 00:33:19.387
history of the human race,
and anybody who follows our

00:33:19.387 --> 00:33:22.299
pattern,
and it's important to realize

00:33:22.299 --> 00:33:26.622
that because there's nothing
inevitable about the development

00:33:26.622 --> 00:33:30.730
that has come about to be
characteristic of the world.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:35.468
When we find people challenging
it, I think they have the bulk

00:33:35.468 --> 00:33:40.051
of time and human experience on
their side when they say you

00:33:40.051 --> 00:33:44.904
guys got it wrong.
So, let me say something

00:33:44.904 --> 00:33:51.868
about the nature of the society
and economy that we find in the

00:33:51.868 --> 00:33:58.831
Mycenaean world revealed both by
the archaeology and by what we

00:33:58.831 --> 00:34:04.109
learn in the records provided by
Linear B.

00:34:04.109 --> 00:34:08.966
The remains and records of
these strongholds make it clear

00:34:08.966 --> 00:34:13.992
that the political organization
was an imitation of oriental

00:34:13.992 --> 00:34:17.023
monarchy.
The sovereignty--the sovereign

00:34:17.023 --> 00:34:19.011
at Mycenae rather,
and at Pylos,

00:34:19.011 --> 00:34:21.639
another important site for the
period,

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:24.545
and at Thebes,
which was another one,

00:34:24.545 --> 00:34:29.469
was somebody that the tablets
refer to as the Wanax,

00:34:29.469 --> 00:34:34.618
and that is the same as a later
Greek word which drops the "W"

00:34:34.618 --> 00:34:37.320
at the beginning,
anax.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.198
As we shall see that word in
later times means some powerful

00:34:42.198 --> 00:34:46.579
individual, but it doesn't mean
what it means here,

00:34:46.579 --> 00:34:51.654
the boss, the single
monarchical controller of

00:34:51.654 --> 00:34:55.485
everything.
He held a royal domain that

00:34:55.485 --> 00:35:00.215
belonged directly to him,
which was very significant in

00:35:00.215 --> 00:35:04.636
size and wealth.
He appointed bureaucratic

00:35:04.636 --> 00:35:08.433
officials;
he commanded royal servants and

00:35:08.433 --> 00:35:11.849
he recorded royal goods,
which by the way,

00:35:11.849 --> 00:35:15.099
most of the tablets are
inventories,

00:35:15.099 --> 00:35:20.276
lists of things that exist in
the palace that belonged to the

00:35:20.276 --> 00:35:22.478
king.
There are other things that

00:35:22.478 --> 00:35:25.970
have to do with instructions
that the king is sending out to

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:29.114
people from the palace.
There is no reference,

00:35:29.114 --> 00:35:32.694
in any of the tablets--I don't
know how much we can make of

00:35:32.694 --> 00:35:36.520
that because the tablets limit
themselves to such limited kinds

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:39.730
of things that maybe it doesn't
prove anything,

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:41.050
but in this case,
I think it does.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:46.910
There is no reference to law.
There is no reference to some

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:51.009
objective or anything other than
the king himself in the

00:35:51.009 --> 00:35:54.447
administration of justice.
One scholar says,

00:35:54.447 --> 00:35:58.204
"It is natural to infer that
the king, all powerful

00:35:58.204 --> 00:36:01.510
controller of the all seeing
bureaucracy,

00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:07.469
possessed supreme authority
also in the region of lawmaking

00:36:07.469 --> 00:36:12.051
and law enforcement.
An omnipresent bureaucracy with

00:36:12.051 --> 00:36:15.795
its detailed and all
encompassing records gives the

00:36:15.795 --> 00:36:20.064
clearest picture of the power
exercised by the centralized

00:36:20.064 --> 00:36:25.225
monarchs of the Mycenaean Age."
The records discovered at Pylos

00:36:25.225 --> 00:36:28.010
here are particularly
interesting.

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:33.749
They cover only one part of a
year and yet they carry details

00:36:33.749 --> 00:36:38.820
of thousands of transactions in
hundreds of places.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:41.554
These files,
as we might call them,

00:36:41.554 --> 00:36:46.139
are both sweepingly inclusive
and penetratingly minute.

00:36:46.139 --> 00:36:49.611
For instance,
bronze is allocated to

00:36:49.611 --> 00:36:54.240
different places for the
manufacture of arrowheads or

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:57.395
swords,
with a note telling how many

00:36:57.395 --> 00:37:01.590
smiths in each place are active
and how many are not.

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:08.600
Cretan sheep are enumerated to
the amount of 20,000.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.870
I'm sorry, that's not right.
I don't want to get this wrong,

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:17.531
25,051, and we learn that in a
Cretan village,

00:37:17.531 --> 00:37:22.710
two nurses, one girl,
and one boy are employed.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:27.296
We are told how much linen is
expected from a place called

00:37:27.296 --> 00:37:29.866
Rion.
What is the acreage of the

00:37:29.866 --> 00:37:32.489
estate of a man called
Alektruon?

00:37:32.489 --> 00:37:36.460
What a guy name Dounias owes
the palace?

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:41.374
The answer is 2200 liters of
barley, 526 of olives,

00:37:41.374 --> 00:37:45.699
468 of wine--I hope you
remember all this;

00:37:45.699 --> 00:37:49.364
fifteen rams,
one fat hog,

00:37:49.364 --> 00:37:55.955
one cow, and two bulls.
We even learned the names of

00:37:55.955 --> 00:38:00.969
two oxen owned by Terzarro:
Glossy and Blackie.

00:38:00.969 --> 00:38:05.289
The records make it perfectly
clear that the kingdoms of Pylos

00:38:05.289 --> 00:38:09.538
and Knossos were bureaucratic
monarchies of a type unexpected

00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:12.341
in Greece,
but in many ways similar to

00:38:12.341 --> 00:38:15.829
some contemporary and earlier
kingdoms in the eastern

00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:19.150
Mediterranean.
It is very unlike anything we

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:23.134
associate with the Greeks,
or anything that ever again

00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:27.453
existed in the Greek world,
and that's really the point I

00:38:27.453 --> 00:38:30.076
want to make.
Although these people are

00:38:30.076 --> 00:38:33.460
Greeks, they are ruling a
culture which is thoroughly

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.429
different from the one we will
be studying for the bulk of the

00:38:37.429 --> 00:38:39.750
semester.
So like the eastern states,

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:42.050
you have a powerful ruler who
is a warlord.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:45.825
There is a palace economy,
there is a script,

00:38:45.825 --> 00:38:50.029
there is a bureaucracy,
and there is collectivized

00:38:50.029 --> 00:38:54.920
agriculture under the central
control of the economy.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:39:00.276
That economy and that society
go forward and flourish for,

00:39:00.276 --> 00:39:05.820
as I say, about 400 years
maybe--perhaps about 400 years.

00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:11.324
Then a bunch of terrible
things obviously begin to happen

00:39:11.324 --> 00:39:17.104
that shake the security of this
society, and ultimately bring it

00:39:17.104 --> 00:39:19.531
down.
Roughly speaking,

00:39:19.531 --> 00:39:23.960
about 1200 B.C.,
we hear of general attacks that

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:28.483
are going on around the
Mediterranean against the

00:39:28.483 --> 00:39:32.630
various civilizations of which
we know.

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:39.039
Egypt experiences a number of
attacks from the outside world.

00:39:39.039 --> 00:39:43.832
Chiefly what we hear about is
in the area of the Nile Delta,

00:39:43.832 --> 00:39:47.000
right there on the
Mediterranean Sea.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.484
Among those attackers,
there are others besides--there

00:39:50.484 --> 00:39:53.602
are attackers from Libya,
we hear, but there are also

00:39:53.602 --> 00:39:55.940
attackers that are simply called
from the sea;

00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:00.783
the sea people attack.
At roughly the same time the

00:40:00.783 --> 00:40:06.072
dominant empire in Asia Minor,
Anatolia, is run by a people

00:40:06.072 --> 00:40:10.323
who are called the Hittites,
who have been there for

00:40:10.323 --> 00:40:14.099
hundreds of years in security
and are now suffering assault.

00:40:14.099 --> 00:40:18.353
We know that because they also
have a writing which we can

00:40:18.353 --> 00:40:22.308
read, and it speaks of it as
well as the archeological

00:40:22.308 --> 00:40:25.889
remains that show
destruction.Similarly,

00:40:25.889 --> 00:40:30.235
attacks are going on against
the kingdoms of Syria and of

00:40:30.235 --> 00:40:34.892
Palestine, which--it's always
hard to know what that piece of

00:40:34.892 --> 00:40:38.849
land should be called at any
particular moment,

00:40:38.849 --> 00:40:43.712
but I call it Palestine because
one of the sea peoples that

00:40:43.712 --> 00:40:48.071
attacked the Nile around 1200 in
Egypt are called the

00:40:48.071 --> 00:40:51.931
Pelest,
and most scholars suggest that

00:40:51.931 --> 00:40:56.557
is the same name as came to be
the name for this region when

00:40:56.557 --> 00:40:59.269
they ruled it,
called Palestine.

00:40:59.269 --> 00:41:03.490
And you will remember that when
the Bible talks about this,

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:06.909
it refers to a people called
the Philistines.

00:41:06.909 --> 00:41:09.349
These are thought to be all the
same people.

00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:14.318
So since they ruled it
until--what's his name,

00:41:14.318 --> 00:41:19.840
Samson took them out with the
jawbone of an ass.

00:41:22.909 --> 00:41:26.659
I think it's proper to call it
Palestine at that moment.

00:41:26.659 --> 00:41:29.713
Cyprus, likewise,
suffers from these attacks,

00:41:29.713 --> 00:41:33.530
and so far west as Italy and
Sicily are under attack.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.609
Something is going on.
The question,

00:41:36.609 --> 00:41:39.940
of course, is what scholars
have disagreed about and

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:43.771
continue to disagree about,
because the evidence simply

00:41:43.771 --> 00:41:47.652
will not permit any confident
answer, but I ought to just

00:41:47.652 --> 00:41:51.950
mention a few of the theories
that have been tossed around,

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:57.375
a few among many, many, many.
One that seems to be in

00:41:57.375 --> 00:42:00.860
fashion these days,
although you never know how

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:05.849
long the fashion lasts,
is: internal uprisings that

00:42:05.849 --> 00:42:11.889
somehow these monarchical areas,
when life got tough,

00:42:11.889 --> 00:42:15.090
the people must have risen up
against them.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:20.584
I think this reflects hopeful
Marxist wish fulfillment rather

00:42:20.584 --> 00:42:24.429
than any reality,
but that is not what poor

00:42:24.429 --> 00:42:28.741
people have done in history.
If you look at revolutions,

00:42:28.741 --> 00:42:31.812
revolutions come typically when
things are getting better and

00:42:31.812 --> 00:42:34.882
the people don't like the fact
that they don't have more than

00:42:34.882 --> 00:42:37.386
they already have.
But, in any case,

00:42:37.386 --> 00:42:40.429
that's one theory.
Earlier theories--it's

00:42:40.429 --> 00:42:44.398
wonderful to have scientific
theories that you can use to

00:42:44.398 --> 00:42:48.494
handle these problems,
which you cannot demonstrate

00:42:48.494 --> 00:42:52.079
any fact for whatsoever.
I'm being a bit strong,

00:42:52.079 --> 00:42:55.115
but not too much.
The one theory made some

00:42:55.115 --> 00:42:59.599
investigations of earth spores,
hoping to find--what do you

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:04.160
call that stuff that floats
around and makes you sneeze?

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:04.720
Pollen.

00:43:09.679 --> 00:43:12.198
So as a result,
they said there were droughts

00:43:12.198 --> 00:43:15.175
in these areas throughout that
period and that caused

00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:17.579
tremendous unhappiness and
discontent.

00:43:17.579 --> 00:43:22.380
Other people have suggested
climatic shift.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.962
I keep waiting for somebody--I
think the time is right for

00:43:25.962 --> 00:43:29.545
somebody to come up with a
theory and explain it by global

00:43:29.545 --> 00:43:33.886
warming.
Also we know that the island in

00:43:33.886 --> 00:43:38.744
the middle of the Aegean Sea,
called Thera,

00:43:38.744 --> 00:43:45.685
blew up in a most enormous kind
of an explosion at some point

00:43:45.685 --> 00:43:52.100
back there in prehistoric days,
and one theory is it was the

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.280
explosion on Thera that caused
so climatic trouble,

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:00.059
that it can explain what went
on here.

00:44:00.059 --> 00:44:02.882
The trouble is,
you just don't know when that

00:44:02.882 --> 00:44:05.962
explosion took place,
and since there are several

00:44:05.962 --> 00:44:09.940
periods in this general area
that we're talking about now,

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.138
in which something big
happened, some great change

00:44:13.138 --> 00:44:16.664
takes place, it turns out
different people want to have

00:44:16.664 --> 00:44:19.210
their explosion at different
times.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:22.093
It's like a moveable feast;
you put your explosion where

00:44:22.093 --> 00:44:24.269
you need it at any particular
moment.

00:44:24.269 --> 00:44:29.255
I am making light of it and I
think it's somewhat justified,

00:44:29.255 --> 00:44:32.719
because the evidence is just so
scanty.

00:44:32.719 --> 00:44:35.892
It's just that I think it's fun
to play the game these guys do,

00:44:35.892 --> 00:44:37.989
but we shouldn't take it too
seriously.

00:44:37.989 --> 00:44:42.864
Now, let's go back to a
theory which has at least got

00:44:42.864 --> 00:44:47.390
the virtue of being very old,
although hardly anybody

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:51.686
believes it anymore.
That is, the theory that what

00:44:51.686 --> 00:44:56.480
happened in the Mycenaean world,
let's forget what was happening

00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:01.114
elsewhere,
was the result of a movement of

00:45:01.114 --> 00:45:07.934
tribes, of ethnic groups who
were outside the Mediterranean

00:45:07.934 --> 00:45:11.215
region,
say at the beginning of this

00:45:11.215 --> 00:45:14.900
period and say in 1600,
but who pressed into it.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:18.436
Usually, the picture is that
they are coming from the north

00:45:18.436 --> 00:45:21.179
or the northeast and pressing
down into it.

00:45:21.179 --> 00:45:25.359
I have to believe that whoever
came up with that theory for the

00:45:25.359 --> 00:45:29.472
first time was aided in coming
to it by thinking about the end

00:45:29.472 --> 00:45:33.126
of the Roman Empire,
when something precisely like

00:45:33.126 --> 00:45:36.098
that did happen.
These Germanic and other

00:45:36.098 --> 00:45:40.840
tribes, who were largely located
north and northeast of Europe,

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.946
came down--I should say not
Europe, but the Roman

00:45:43.946 --> 00:45:47.829
Empire--came down and ultimately
destroyed it by invasion.

00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:50.179
And of course,
there are more theories about

00:45:50.179 --> 00:45:53.458
the fall of the Roman Empire
than there are about the fall of

00:45:53.458 --> 00:45:57.852
the Mycenaean world.
Anyway, connected to all of

00:45:57.852 --> 00:46:03.521
this was a very interesting
Greek myth, which speaks about

00:46:03.521 --> 00:46:07.400
the return of the
Heraclides.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.176
They are the sons of the
mythical hero Hercules,

00:46:12.176 --> 00:46:17.739
who was a Peloponnesian figure,
and the story goes that the

00:46:17.739 --> 00:46:22.651
sons of Hercules were expelled
from the Peloponnesus and then

00:46:22.651 --> 00:46:27.480
promised that they would come
back a hundred years later and

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:31.235
conquer it.
And so they did come back

00:46:31.235 --> 00:46:34.756
hundred years later and
conquered it,

00:46:34.756 --> 00:46:40.331
and since--this is the link
that explains the old story in

00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:46.046
historical Greek times,
let us say the fifth century

00:46:46.046 --> 00:46:52.210
B.C., the people who inhabited
the Peloponnesus were mainly

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:57.099
speakers of the Greek dialect
called Doric.

00:46:57.099 --> 00:47:01.282
It was thought that Hercules'
sons and Hercules being

00:47:01.282 --> 00:47:04.659
Peloponnesians no doubt spoke
Doric too,

00:47:04.659 --> 00:47:09.840
and so this was referred to as
by scholars in the nineteenth

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.090
century, not by the ancient
Greeks,

00:47:13.090 --> 00:47:17.217
as a Dorian invasion.
In other words,

00:47:17.217 --> 00:47:21.748
another kind of Greek.
The Greeks who lived in the

00:47:21.748 --> 00:47:25.600
area before the fall of the
Mycenaean world,

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.959
what were they called?
Well, Homer gives us several

00:47:29.959 --> 00:47:33.289
names for them,
but three stick out for me.

00:47:33.289 --> 00:47:37.690
The most common and the most
widely used was Achaeans,

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:42.090
another one is Danaans,
and a third one is Argives.

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:46.015
Argives comes from the fact
that they rule over the land

00:47:46.015 --> 00:47:50.109
Argos in Greece.
Now, the one that has some

00:47:50.109 --> 00:47:55.728
clout historically is Achaeans,
because in the records of the

00:47:55.728 --> 00:47:59.759
Hittite kings,
there are references to

00:47:59.759 --> 00:48:05.380
people--I'm trying to think,
I think they're called,

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.392
I want to get this right,
but I don't remember whether

00:48:08.392 --> 00:48:12.744
this is the Egyptian or,
something like akhaiwashaa,

00:48:12.744 --> 00:48:16.289
unless that's the Egyptian
form.

00:48:16.289 --> 00:48:20.510
Anyway they are called by names
that sound something like that;

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:23.971
one among the Hittites,
one among the Egyptians and

00:48:23.971 --> 00:48:26.953
it's so easy.
Given the fact that the letter

00:48:26.953 --> 00:48:30.712
"w" dropped out of the Greek
language between the Mycenaean

00:48:30.712 --> 00:48:35.478
Period and the Classical Period,
you could easily imagine that

00:48:35.478 --> 00:48:39.699
these people were
referred--referred to themselves

00:48:39.699 --> 00:48:43.570
as achaiwoi,
and when the "w" drops out

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:47.361
they are achaioi,
which is what Homer calls

00:48:47.361 --> 00:48:50.735
them.
So, the idea here is that the

00:48:50.735 --> 00:48:56.247
original Greeks who came in,
were what we call Achaeans and

00:48:56.247 --> 00:49:01.949
that when these disturbances
came and if the Dorian theory is

00:49:01.949 --> 00:49:05.234
true,
Dorians either killed them all

00:49:05.234 --> 00:49:08.657
or dominated them,
possibly intermarried with

00:49:08.657 --> 00:49:11.513
them,
but dominated them and washed

00:49:11.513 --> 00:49:15.980
away, wiped out the use of the
Achaean language and imposed

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:18.829
their own Dorian language upon
it.

00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:22.403
And supporting such an
idea, among other things,

00:49:22.403 --> 00:49:26.186
is that if you go to the
mountains in the center of the

00:49:26.186 --> 00:49:29.760
Peloponnesus where it's awfully
hard to get to,

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.400
there is a region called,
well, actually beyond those

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.849
mountains, on the northern
shore,

00:49:35.849 --> 00:49:40.519
is a place called Achaea,
where the people are Achaeans.

00:49:40.519 --> 00:49:43.521
So, the theory might well be
that they were driven away from

00:49:43.521 --> 00:49:45.760
their old homes in the southern
Peloponnesus,

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.050
and went up to the northern
Peloponnesus.

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:52.109
Then there are the people in
the mountains of Arcadia who

00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:56.095
also don't speak the Doric
language, and maybe they were

00:49:56.095 --> 00:50:00.217
driven up there to escape.
So those are the things that

00:50:00.217 --> 00:50:04.459
helped people decide that the
Dorians may really have been the

00:50:04.459 --> 00:50:07.916
sons of Hercules,
who actually invaded and that

00:50:07.916 --> 00:50:12.119
what we find after the fall of
the Mycenaean world in Greece

00:50:12.119 --> 00:50:15.895
are some of the following
things--things that were not

00:50:15.895 --> 00:50:19.030
typically found in the Mycenaean
world.

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:22.630
First of all,
iron weapons,

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:27.435
not bronze ones.
A kind of a pin used to hold

00:50:27.435 --> 00:50:31.119
your cloak together,
called a fibula,

00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:34.710
unknown in the previous
period.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:39.183
The building of buildings in
the shape of what the Greeks

00:50:39.183 --> 00:50:42.580
called a megaron,
a rectangular center,

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.034
which has a hearth in it,
a front porch,

00:50:45.034 --> 00:50:48.933
and a back porch which will be
the style in which Greek temples

00:50:48.933 --> 00:50:51.449
are built in the historical
period.

00:50:51.449 --> 00:50:55.706
That appears for the first time
after the fall of the

00:50:55.706 --> 00:50:58.912
Mycenaeans.
We know that the Mycenaeans

00:50:58.912 --> 00:51:03.039
buried their dead by inhumation,
those great tombs,

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:06.217
those great graves,
and even the common people

00:51:06.217 --> 00:51:08.760
outside them are buried in
graves;

00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:14.013
whereas, in the historical
period, these people were

00:51:14.013 --> 00:51:19.370
cremated rather than buried in
the world of Homer.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:23.262
That's what we see.
So, the idea that was put

00:51:23.262 --> 00:51:27.737
forward in the nineteenth
century was that the Dorians who

00:51:27.737 --> 00:51:31.023
were a less civilized,
tougher, meaner,

00:51:31.023 --> 00:51:36.151
harder fighting people assisted
by the use of iron and in their

00:51:36.151 --> 00:51:40.699
weapons which were superior
allegedly to the bronze,

00:51:40.699 --> 00:51:43.615
came down, defeated the
Achaeans, imposed themselves on

00:51:43.615 --> 00:51:47.070
them where they could and drove
them away where they couldn't,

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:50.449
and that explains how things
went.

00:51:50.449 --> 00:51:53.861
That has been attacked and
is largely not believed these

00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:56.925
days for a whole lot of
technical reasons that I don't

00:51:56.925 --> 00:51:59.179
want to trouble you with right
now.

00:51:59.179 --> 00:52:03.539
I do not think we can believe
that simple story as it stands.

00:52:03.539 --> 00:52:08.156
It is too simple and there are
too many things that it doesn't

00:52:08.156 --> 00:52:12.620
account for and there are too
many things would suggest that

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:17.148
it's not correct.
However, I am not sure there is

00:52:17.148 --> 00:52:22.172
nothing in that story,
and here I really am influenced

00:52:22.172 --> 00:52:27.326
most strongly by my colleague,
professor Jerome Pollitt,

00:52:27.326 --> 00:52:30.730
now retired,
who was our History of Art and

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:34.172
Archaeology guy.
He has a notion that is very

00:52:34.172 --> 00:52:38.250
nuanced and sophisticated and it
appeals to me quite a lot.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:42.196
He suggests that there were,
indeed, Greek tribes from the

00:52:42.196 --> 00:52:46.743
north who spoke Dorian dialects,
who came down during this

00:52:46.743 --> 00:52:51.920
period attempting to come into
the richer and better settled

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:55.770
world of the Mycenaeans.
They didn't come down and then

00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.039
go away for hundred years and
then come back,

00:52:58.039 --> 00:53:03.181
but rather they came down in
waves of tribes and families,

00:53:03.181 --> 00:53:06.699
and so on, exerting gradual
pressure,

00:53:06.699 --> 00:53:11.516
pushing in when they could,
retreating when they couldn't,

00:53:11.516 --> 00:53:14.593
and so on.
For this I think there's a very

00:53:14.593 --> 00:53:18.454
good--whether or not you accept
the Dorian idea--I think we

00:53:18.454 --> 00:53:22.448
should find attractive the idea
that if there was an external

00:53:22.448 --> 00:53:25.465
invasion,
it came in this way over a

00:53:25.465 --> 00:53:28.995
period of time,
a century or two with success

00:53:28.995 --> 00:53:32.094
and then retreat,
not having success,

00:53:32.094 --> 00:53:36.342
flight, all that kind of stuff
going on.Because the

00:53:36.342 --> 00:53:40.826
Mycenaean centers all reveal for
that stretch of time that

00:53:40.826 --> 00:53:44.435
they're scared.
The proof of it comes from

00:53:44.435 --> 00:53:49.053
strengthening their already
quite strong walls in almost all

00:53:49.053 --> 00:53:52.809
the sites that we see,
and also--this is a very

00:53:52.809 --> 00:53:55.613
important fact.
If you're expecting to be

00:53:55.613 --> 00:53:58.949
attacked and besieged,
as all these citadels would be

00:53:58.949 --> 00:54:01.642
by an invader,
you would want more than

00:54:01.642 --> 00:54:05.381
anything else a water supply,
but they didn't necessarily

00:54:05.381 --> 00:54:08.719
have good water supplies in such
circumstances.

00:54:08.719 --> 00:54:13.610
So, we see the building of
water holders in these places;

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:17.692
there's a very striking one.
The next time you go to Mycenae

00:54:17.692 --> 00:54:21.621
don't miss the cistern that was
dug in the mountains,

00:54:21.621 --> 00:54:24.643
on the hillside,
within the walls at that

00:54:24.643 --> 00:54:27.666
period.
It's deep and you better take a

00:54:27.666 --> 00:54:31.489
flashlight because it's as black
as it can possibly be.

00:54:31.489 --> 00:54:35.575
But they spent a lot of time,
energy, and money on being sure

00:54:35.575 --> 00:54:39.729
that they would have a supply of
water to hold them for a long

00:54:39.729 --> 00:54:42.758
siege.
I think that that indicates

00:54:42.758 --> 00:54:47.802
that something of the kind is
going on.Then we see that

00:54:47.802 --> 00:54:51.019
when this culture comes to an
end,

00:54:51.019 --> 00:54:55.686
it is accompanied by people
fleeing, getting away from the

00:54:55.686 --> 00:54:59.225
Mycenaean world.
Some of them only go so far as

00:54:59.225 --> 00:55:02.944
Athens, which had the good
fortune somehow of not being

00:55:02.944 --> 00:55:05.298
destroyed,
one of the few important

00:55:05.298 --> 00:55:07.730
Mycenaean places that is not
destroyed.

00:55:07.730 --> 00:55:11.530
So, for some reason it was safe
in Athens and some fled to

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:13.942
Athens.
Others had to keep going and

00:55:13.942 --> 00:55:16.659
settled on the islands of the
Aegean Sea.

00:55:16.659 --> 00:55:20.625
For others, it was necessary to
go further and to settle the

00:55:20.625 --> 00:55:23.353
west coast of Asia Minor,
which, indeed,

00:55:23.353 --> 00:55:27.396
this is a great period of Greek
settlement on the west coast of

00:55:27.396 --> 00:55:30.647
Asia Minor.
Then it looks like there came a

00:55:30.647 --> 00:55:34.720
moment where there was a final
blow, where whatever was

00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:39.018
attempting to overthrow these
cities and this civilization

00:55:39.018 --> 00:55:41.849
succeeded,
but it was not the same in

00:55:41.849 --> 00:55:45.056
every place.
The fall of Pylos is generally

00:55:45.056 --> 00:55:50.474
thought to be around 1200 B.C.;
Mycenae itself may be fifty

00:55:50.474 --> 00:55:55.530
years later, and other places
later than that.

00:55:55.530 --> 00:56:01.048
I think it's very important to
notice that some of these places

00:56:01.048 --> 00:56:06.299
that were big in the Mycenaean
world were entirely abandoned

00:56:06.299 --> 00:56:09.860
and not settled again by the
Greeks.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:12.811
Buried, lost,
people didn't even know where

00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:16.931
they were, that's extraordinary.
That only happens when

00:56:16.931 --> 00:56:20.393
something very,
very large drives people away

00:56:20.393 --> 00:56:24.804
from an inhabited site.
So, here is where Jerry

00:56:24.804 --> 00:56:31.280
Pollitt's analogy to the fall of
Rome seems so very appealing.

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:34.141
That is, more or less,
what did happen in the Roman

00:56:34.141 --> 00:56:37.461
world and I don't see anything
that's suggested it couldn't

00:56:37.461 --> 00:56:41.010
happen in the Greek world at the
time we're talking about.

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.920
I'm trying to figure out;
we quit when,

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.620
ten until 1:00,
right?

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:53.497
Right, yeah, okay.
Now, I suppose the most

00:56:53.497 --> 00:57:01.158
important aspect of all of this
for our purposes are the results

00:57:01.158 --> 00:57:06.510
of all of this,
and they were tremendous.

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:11.376
You have the destruction
completely of the Mycenaean

00:57:11.376 --> 00:57:15.928
Bronze Age culture.
Greece never sees anything like

00:57:15.928 --> 00:57:17.909
it again.
This is not the way it was in

00:57:17.909 --> 00:57:20.529
the ancient Near East.
This is not the way it was in

00:57:20.529 --> 00:57:23.513
Egypt.
There you see continuity for a

00:57:23.513 --> 00:57:27.243
very, very long time.
The Greek world has this

00:57:27.243 --> 00:57:31.612
tremendous discontinuity.
It's like the door slams and

00:57:31.612 --> 00:57:37.775
you got to go into a new room.
Among the things that are lost

00:57:37.775 --> 00:57:41.900
for a long time,
there is writing.

00:57:41.900 --> 00:57:47.157
There is no writing in Greece
from let us say1100 or so on

00:57:47.157 --> 00:57:51.400
until the middle of the eighth
century B.C.,

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.902
rough date 750 and then the
writing that they do have is

00:57:55.902 --> 00:58:00.159
completely unrelated to the
writing that was lost.

00:58:00.159 --> 00:58:01.929
They get it from a different
place.

00:58:01.929 --> 00:58:05.354
The letters,
the design of the writing

00:58:05.354 --> 00:58:08.502
comes, in fact,
from Asia, probably

00:58:08.502 --> 00:58:12.389
from--almost certainly from
Phoenicia,

00:58:12.389 --> 00:58:17.209
the land that is now called
Lebanon and the language that

00:58:17.209 --> 00:58:20.909
was for that script was Semitic
language.

00:58:20.909 --> 00:58:23.616
Hebrew is close to what's
going on there,

00:58:23.616 --> 00:58:25.769
but they don't take the
language.

00:58:25.769 --> 00:58:30.586
They borrow the characters from
what had been already something

00:58:30.586 --> 00:58:35.015
quite close to an alphabet and
had only a relatively small

00:58:35.015 --> 00:58:37.327
number.
I forget the exact number of

00:58:37.327 --> 00:58:39.930
the ones in the Semitic
alphabet, but we're talking

00:58:39.930 --> 00:58:43.216
about roughly twenty-five.
I mean, you're into the

00:58:43.216 --> 00:58:46.230
ballgame for an alphabet such as
ours.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:50.769
The Greeks borrow that with
typical Greek innovation.

00:58:50.769 --> 00:58:56.294
They do the big step of
inventing vowels so that now you

00:58:56.294 --> 00:59:01.885
don't have to remember anything.
You can read every sound that

00:59:01.885 --> 00:59:05.110
is made, and they produced their
alphabet.

00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:08.790
But their alphabet has got
nothing to do with Mycenae;

00:59:08.790 --> 00:59:12.872
this is a new thing altogether.
The Greeks are totally

00:59:12.872 --> 00:59:15.789
illiterate from around 1100 to
750.

00:59:15.789 --> 00:59:20.830
Another characteristic of these
years, which scholars refer to

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:24.495
as the Dark Ages,
just as they do the years after

00:59:24.495 --> 00:59:28.010
the fall of the Roman
Empire--dark for two reasons.

00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:30.930
Dark, in the most obvious way,
because we don't have any

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:34.160
writing, no record of them.
We can't see.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.168
It's dark.
The other, dark,

00:59:37.168 --> 00:59:41.309
in the sense of gloomy,
not good, bad;

00:59:41.309 --> 00:59:43.281
this is a hard time,
a poor time,

00:59:43.281 --> 00:59:45.500
a wretched time,
a miserable time.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:49.608
These are dark times.
So, that's what is meant by the

00:59:49.608 --> 00:59:52.971
term, Dark Ages,
and that's what does follow the

00:59:52.971 --> 00:59:56.881
fall of the Mycenaean world.
Part of the story is that

00:59:56.881 --> 01:00:00.147
that old connection that the
Mycenaean world had with the

01:00:00.147 --> 01:00:03.554
Mediterranean in general,
most particularly,

01:00:03.554 --> 01:00:07.496
with the East stops,
we don't find in the

01:00:07.496 --> 01:00:13.410
excavations we make of Greek
towns in the Dark Ages--we don't

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:16.965
find implements,
jewels, goodies,

01:00:16.965 --> 01:00:21.607
anything from Egypt or
Mesopotamia or anything like

01:00:21.607 --> 01:00:23.431
that.
Nor by the way,

01:00:23.431 --> 01:00:26.460
do you find Greek things in
those places.

01:00:26.460 --> 01:00:30.389
The Greeks are isolated during
this period.

01:00:30.389 --> 01:00:33.230
Of course, everything I'm
saying is somewhat exaggerated.

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:36.853
I'm sure there must have been
individual exceptions to

01:00:36.853 --> 01:00:41.159
everything, but we're talking
about the overwhelming reality.

01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:45.615
And not only are the Greeks
as a whole cut off from the rest

01:00:45.615 --> 01:00:48.019
of the world,
but Greece itself,

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:50.837
which used to be an area of
easy exchange,

01:00:50.837 --> 01:00:54.960
where people could go from one
place to the other and did,

01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:58.150
localism now comes into the
picture.

01:00:58.150 --> 01:01:02.143
The unity is broken.
It's again like--I hope you

01:01:02.143 --> 01:01:06.586
know something about the early
middle ages where places were

01:01:06.586 --> 01:01:10.804
simply cut off one from the
other and there were no roads

01:01:10.804 --> 01:01:14.474
kept or made,
and just going from one village

01:01:14.474 --> 01:01:17.910
to another was a strange and
dangerous thing,

01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:22.091
because nobody was in charge.
Things were completely out of

01:01:22.091 --> 01:01:24.080
control.
That's the way things clearly

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.098
were in the Greek world.
For instance,

01:01:26.098 --> 01:01:28.666
you can see pottery,
which used to have this,

01:01:28.666 --> 01:01:31.059
remember this largely unitary
quality.

01:01:31.059 --> 01:01:35.582
You can tell if you're at all
experienced with it very easily,

01:01:35.582 --> 01:01:38.769
if you go--let's say to the
year 900 B.C.

01:01:38.769 --> 01:01:42.088
You can tell if a pot comes
from Athens or it comes from

01:01:42.088 --> 01:01:45.648
Pylos, or--not Pylos it was
probably out of business--Thebes

01:01:45.648 --> 01:01:49.388
or someplace else because they
have their local characteristics

01:01:49.388 --> 01:01:52.782
which are perfectly obvious.
This suggests that they're not

01:01:52.782 --> 01:01:55.210
seeing each other's goods;
they're not trading them.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:02:00.389
They're simply working within
their own very narrow ambit.

01:02:00.389 --> 01:02:04.440
That's the kind of a world that
is being created.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:10.239
Something less easy to say
confidently, but probably clear,

01:02:10.239 --> 01:02:15.664
I think, is the whole legacy of
Mycenaean culture is really

01:02:15.664 --> 01:02:20.575
lost, not fully though.
There is always something that

01:02:20.575 --> 01:02:25.504
we call folk memory that has a
recollection of the distant past

01:02:25.504 --> 01:02:28.570
which may have truth to it,
but may not,

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:31.124
or it may have only an element
of truth to it,

01:02:31.124 --> 01:02:34.810
and it's always very hard.
What comes back in this form is

01:02:34.810 --> 01:02:37.442
usually what we call legend,
and anybody,

01:02:37.442 --> 01:02:41.720
who rejects legend across the
board as simply being invention,

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:45.029
is just dead wrong.
Anybody who tries to use it as

01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:47.714
an accurate account of what
really happened is no less

01:02:47.714 --> 01:02:50.067
wrong.
Some place in the middle is

01:02:50.067 --> 01:02:53.090
where the truth is,
and it's hard to find.

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:57.390
But in any case,
what we find are a number of

01:02:57.390 --> 01:03:01.929
units in the Greek world.
Call them towns for the sake of

01:03:01.929 --> 01:03:04.869
argument, sounds too urban,
but call them that.

01:03:04.869 --> 01:03:09.428
Small, that means to say small
in extent, few people,

01:03:09.428 --> 01:03:13.110
because the population surely
went down,

01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:16.277
since the capacity to grow
food, to distribute it,

01:03:16.277 --> 01:03:20.156
that whole system that depended
on the existence of a central

01:03:20.156 --> 01:03:23.260
palace and a strong king running
everything,

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.767
running production,
running distribution,

01:03:25.767 --> 01:03:28.449
it's gone.
You know that doesn't come back.

01:03:28.449 --> 01:03:31.719
When that's destroyed,
you're in terrible shape.

01:03:31.719 --> 01:03:38.415
So, the population surely
dropped, and all the evidence we

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:44.297
have supports that.
So, what you have are small,

01:03:44.297 --> 01:03:49.279
poor, weak units,
and that's a miserable

01:03:49.279 --> 01:03:53.368
situation.
Now, they have no choice,

01:03:53.368 --> 01:03:58.418
they cannot rely as human
beings typically do on just

01:03:58.418 --> 01:04:03.554
doing what your parents did,
just inheriting a tradition

01:04:03.554 --> 01:04:06.781
that functions,
that works, that keeps you

01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:09.050
going.
They couldn't do it.

01:04:09.050 --> 01:04:12.807
The survivors had to figure out
a new way to do things and they

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.989
didn't do anything new in a
hurry.

01:04:14.989 --> 01:04:17.966
This all came hard and at the
cost, I'm sure,

01:04:17.966 --> 01:04:21.010
of a lot of human life and a
lot of misery.

01:04:21.010 --> 01:04:23.730
But what comes out of it is
something different.

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:27.149
Now, I jumped though.
We do know that certain

01:04:27.149 --> 01:04:30.370
memories lasted.
The Greeks always thought there

01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:33.351
was an earlier age.
The Greeks of the classical

01:04:33.351 --> 01:04:37.156
period always thought there was
an earlier age that was much

01:04:37.156 --> 01:04:39.930
better than the age in which
they lived,

01:04:39.930 --> 01:04:44.045
an age in which men were heroes.
They were bigger,

01:04:44.045 --> 01:04:46.778
they were stronger,
they were tougher,

01:04:46.778 --> 01:04:49.881
they were faster,
they were more beautiful,

01:04:49.881 --> 01:04:53.547
they lived longer.
Those were the great old days

01:04:53.547 --> 01:04:56.940
and then there's us,
we, poor miserable wretches.

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:01.150
That's the picture that the
Greeks carried with them.

01:05:01.150 --> 01:05:04.642
The legends,
just stories from generation to

01:05:04.642 --> 01:05:08.541
generation, changed,
and molded, but nonetheless,

01:05:08.541 --> 01:05:13.090
retaining certain elements of
the earlier tradition.

01:05:13.090 --> 01:05:15.782
Then, finally,
we have to believe,

01:05:15.782 --> 01:05:19.944
there's no escaping,
I think, that there was another

01:05:19.944 --> 01:05:25.076
thing that provided for memory,
something we call the epic

01:05:25.076 --> 01:05:28.537
tradition.
When we get to Homer we

01:05:28.537 --> 01:05:33.994
will find a highly developed
epic poetry and once we come to

01:05:33.994 --> 01:05:39.730
grips with the fact that it was
orally composed and recollected

01:05:39.730 --> 01:05:42.581
poetry,
then you will get some idea of

01:05:42.581 --> 01:05:45.659
the length of time that must
have been involved in the

01:05:45.659 --> 01:05:49.143
creating of it--we'll turn to
this when we get to the Homeric

01:05:49.143 --> 01:05:52.490
issues.
Once you realize that there are

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:57.619
clearly accurate depictions of
aspects of the Mycenaean world

01:05:57.619 --> 01:06:02.181
that show up in those poems,
which appear to have been

01:06:02.181 --> 01:06:06.539
written down for the first time,
perhaps around 750 B.C.

01:06:06.539 --> 01:06:09.951
or so, then you must realize
there had to be an epic

01:06:09.951 --> 01:06:14.232
tradition, a poetic tradition of
the same kind that goes back all

01:06:14.232 --> 01:06:18.778
the way to the Mycenaean Period.
I think we must remember that

01:06:18.778 --> 01:06:23.130
there were people creating and
repeating, and working out,

01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:29.019
and changing a poetic tradition
that started in the Mycenaean

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:33.829
world and lasted for the rest of
Greek history.

01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:39.658
Now, the legacy from the
Mycenaeans to Greek civilization

01:06:39.658 --> 01:06:43.468
later is very limited.
But what there is,

01:06:43.468 --> 01:06:48.479
is very important and no part
of it is more important than the

01:06:48.479 --> 01:06:53.007
Homeric poems themselves.
But if we look at the society

01:06:53.007 --> 01:06:56.003
that emerges,
this Dark Age society that

01:06:56.003 --> 01:06:59.460
emerges from the ancient world
of Mycenae,

01:06:59.460 --> 01:07:01.789
what you have is a rare human
experience.

01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:07.932
The creation almost of a clean
slate, even more so I would

01:07:07.932 --> 01:07:14.829
argue than the disruption that
it came after the fall of Rome,

01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:17.090
because there's one big
difference.

01:07:17.090 --> 01:07:21.357
The fall of Rome did not
destroy one of the most

01:07:21.357 --> 01:07:26.170
important tenacious and
significant aspects of the old

01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:28.976
culture,
the Roman Catholic Church,

01:07:28.976 --> 01:07:32.474
which remained and became the
central fact for the new

01:07:32.474 --> 01:07:34.708
culture.
There's nothing like that in

01:07:34.708 --> 01:07:37.572
the Mycenaean world.
We are really talking about

01:07:37.572 --> 01:07:40.139
something that's almost entirely
fresh.

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:44.820
The Greeks had no choice but to
try to find their own way,

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:49.418
uninfluenced as Mycenae was
influenced by Mesopotamia and

01:07:49.418 --> 01:07:51.535
Egypt;
uninfluenced by

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:56.543
anything-starting from the
lowest possible place and having

01:07:56.543 --> 01:07:59.513
to make a living,
and to go forward,

01:07:59.513 --> 01:08:03.658
and to shape a world which was
their own because there wasn't

01:08:03.658 --> 01:08:07.936
anything else to guide them.
Next time we'll take a look at

01:08:07.936 --> 01:08:11.000
the Dark Ages and the world of
Homer.

[CLICKING]

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:17.590
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
All right, folks.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.673
I know you're excited to
learn about weather data.

00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:24.640
I've been told you're excited
to learn about weather data.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.170
I'm going to do the
first few slides.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.030
Tina's going to take
over for the ones that

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.830
require intelligence.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.900
And I'm going to
come back at the end.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.700
OK.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.300
Remember that VFR,
ordinarily, is

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.130
a ceiling of 1,000 feet
or more and visibility

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:46.570
of three statute miles or more.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.180
That's one of the few
things in aviation

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.700
that's reported in statute
miles is the visibility.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.860
As Tina mentioned
earlier, a ceiling

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.570
is a broken or overcast
layer, or sometimes,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.638
if it's really nasty, you'll see
a vertical visibility reported.

00:01:05.638 --> 00:01:07.180
So here are some of
the abbreviations

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.680
that you might see
on the right in a

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.410
METAR.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.580
Remember these weather
minimums, so VFR pilots,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.200
we're looking at
the weather reports

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.533
to see if we're going to be
able to maintain these cloud

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:23.360
clearances and, generally,
stay out of the clouds.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.290
So I wanted to tell you that
it's not quite as hard as you

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.870
might think because
computer programs make

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.908
a lot of what you're going
to learn about simpler.

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.450
On the other hand, we want to
give you the good fundamentals,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.000
because what we're
going to show you,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.930
these are the basis of what
these computer programs are

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.950
presenting to you.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.350
They're oftentimes
getting the same data

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.130
and spinning it in some
interesting graphical way.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.238
So we're going to show you
all the fundamental text

00:01:54.238 --> 00:01:55.780
weather that people
have been relying

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.030
on since at least the '50s.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.160
There are weather graphics
you can grab on the web

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.523
or sometimes in flight.

00:02:01.523 --> 00:02:03.190
How do you get the
weather on the ground

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.200
and how do you
get it in the air?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.360
So most of what
you're going to see

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.690
in the rest of this
presentation can actually

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.200
be summarized by
clever programmers.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.380
And I think the cleverest
programmer of all

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.330
is this guy David Boozer who
taught the class last year.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.360
And fortunately, he's taking a
jet type-- well, fortunately,

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.080
for him he's taking a jet
type rating course right now.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.460
So he couldn't be with us,
but here is WeatherSpork.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.000
If you want to ever have a
good illustration of the value

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.970
of an MBA and
studying marketing,

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.920
just think about the name for
this product of WeatherSpork.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.380
Let's say we want to go from
Bedford to the Gaithersburg,

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.140
Maryland airport.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.320
It's going to show us--

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.470
this was I think
from Sunday evening.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.540
It's pretty nasty
here at Bedford.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.600
I believe that's low IFR,
that purple, and then here

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.680
a marginal VFR, marginal VFR.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.320
Actually, sorry, maybe
the blue is a VFR.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.570
That's the problem
with color codes.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.740
Anyway, you get these symbols
for VFR, marginal VFR, IFR,

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.570
and low IFR.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.940
But here, here's the altitude.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.430
We're going from C level up
to 11,000 feet or 12,000 feet

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.480
at the top.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.760
It shows you inside
this blue area

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.050
where the freezing levels are.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.090
It's kind of a weird
mixed up situation here

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.570
with this freezing level here,
another freezing level here.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.950
There's AIRMETs.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.360
It looks pretty scary.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.480
Once we get down closer to
the DC area, it's not so bad.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.350
There's only one
AIRMET and it looks

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.080
like we could be in the
clear of the clouds up here.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.580
But this is a good
way to summarize.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.400
It this already shows you
that it's probably not

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.150
going to be wise
to go on Sunday at,

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.840
I guess, this was
Sunday at 1:00 PM.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.430
OK.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.770
Here, notice on the bottom,
the time keeps changing.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.710
So we're going from
Sunday at 1:00 PM.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.990
The middle screen capture
is to go Sunday at 10:00 PM.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.610
This is at eastern time.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.279
And the last one is
to go Monday at 8:30.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:23.290
So you can see from this
already that you could take off

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.770
from Hanscom field,
rise up to 1,500 feet

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.850
or so on the right,
and just cruise

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.430
along never even
getting inside a cloud

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.050
until you landed
at Gaithersburg.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.480
That's kind of a low
altitude, so you might end up

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:40.780
deciding, well, what I really
want to do is find a hole

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.230
and go up to about 7,000 or
8,000 feet and go on top of it

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.330
all and come back
down, but whatever.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.360
It looks like you could
probably remain clear of clouds,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.160
make it to your destination.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.370
You're not going to pass
through a lot of AIRMETs.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.130
Over here, let's look at
this one in the middle

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.590
because it's not
quite as terrifying.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.710
There's a low turbulence low
from the surface all the way up

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.700
to 18,000 feet.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.780
If it says a turbulence
AIRMET that goes up to 8,000,

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.160
that's kind of normal.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.980
And oftentimes, if you climb
to four or five or six,

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:14.910
it'll smooth out.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.160
But if the turbulence is
forecast to go all the way up

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.160
into the flight levels, you
know that's a pretty ugly day.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.202
They're saying there's
going to be low level wind

00:05:22.202 --> 00:05:23.940
shear from zero to 2000 feet.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.700
There's going to
be IFR conditions.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.050
And it's going to be gusting
18 knots, so all of that

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.450
is pretty bad unless
you really have to go.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.520
Here look, icing from
the freezing level

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:43.740
up to flight level 230, just
a collection of hazards.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.340
But also look at the difference
between Sunday and Monday.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.860
If you just hang out in the
ground and you're patient.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.570
You don't need a
superior level of skill

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.268
if you have a superior
level of judgment.

00:05:54.268 --> 00:05:56.310
Here's some more presentations
from WeatherSpork.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.830
Again, I kind of love this app.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.750
You have all the airports
you're going to fly near.

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.870
So you go from
Bedford to Worcester,

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.630
some places in Connecticut.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:11.230
I think that's Morristown
in New Jersey, Pennsylvania,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.830
Lancaster, anyway, on
the way to Gaithersburg.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.590
And it shows you here's
your time of departure.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.280
You're going to depart, but hey
look, It would just get to be--

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.030
I guess that is.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.510
That does mean blue must
be marginal VFR, and then

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:29.010
green it's going
to be windy, but it

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.589
will be nice VFR weather.

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:32.047
So if we just wait
a little bit, we

00:06:32.047 --> 00:06:36.660
won't have to fly through any
areas that are challenging.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.360
ForeFlight has a mode where
you can ask for your weather

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.080
briefing in a PDF format.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.125
And this is the first
page of that PDF format.

00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:48.920
It shows some of the same ideas.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:56.020
There are these graphics, these
blue half moons, if you will,

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.150
for icing.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.650
You can see there's
a key down here.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.040
It says icing severity.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.637
So up here, you've got
varying degrees of ice.

00:07:03.637 --> 00:07:05.220
You probably don't
want to be up there

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:06.930
in an aircraft like the Cirrus.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.360
It doesn't have
de-icing capability.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.880
So now I think it
said all up to Tina

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:19.795
to talk about the exciting
world of actual weather data.

00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:20.920
TINA SRIVASTAVA: All right.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.260
So we're going to talk
about weather data

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.130
in the form of reports
as well as forecasts.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:29.950
So what is the difference
between a report

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.180
and a forecast?

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.070
So a report is
actually telling you

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.430
what's actually happening,
so it's a current weather

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:39.340
condition at a
particular location.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.340
A forecast is a forecast.

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.040
It's a guess as to what
is going to happen.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.000
So it's really important to know
the difference between these.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.160
We now have Mark
Nathanson up in the back

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.830
who's going to be
talking to you at 4:00

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:55.060
about some really cool stuff.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.820
And as we talked about,
he's an FAA examiner.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.890
Probably doesn't remember
this, but he asked me

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:06.190
during my oral exam, for a
given piece of weather data,

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.570
is that a report or a forecast?

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.830
And if it's a forecast, how
much should I rely on that

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:12.855
or depend on that?

00:08:12.855 --> 00:08:14.230
And so that's
something to really

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.180
keep in mind the
difference between knowing

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.760
what the actual situation
is and what somebody guesses

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.620
the situation is going to be.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.130
And of course, depending
how far out that guess is,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.700
it may or may not actually
turn out to be true.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.630
So a METAR is a
report, and so it's

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.460
timestamped so it will
tell you the weather

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.640
at a particular time and
a particular location.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.500
And one thing that's
important to think

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.450
about when you think
about direction

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.830
is the way that the
wind is reported.

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.868
So if you hear it, so like if
you're listening to the ADDS.

00:08:45.868 --> 00:08:47.410
We talked about the
ADDS quite a bit,

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.780
so you tune in the ADDS
frequency and you listen to it.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:51.820
They're going to be
telling you that wind

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.590
direction in magnetic.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.680
If you read it on
a printed document,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.800
it's pretty much
always at true heading.

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.280
And certainly, on the internet
as we'll give you some sources,

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.670
that's like the
same as reading it.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.410
We already covered ceilings.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:09.460
I won't get into that.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.370
So let's just talk about the
breakdown of a METAR report.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:16.990
So I discussed that generally,
for example, at Bedford.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.230
You might hear the METAR
updated every hour or so.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.940
And we talked about
the identifier,

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.640
that this is
information whiskey,

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.370
maybe an hour
later it's the next

00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:29.320
as they keep going
through the alphabet.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.440
And one time that you
might see it updated

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.930
more frequently than
once every hour or so

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.643
is if they need to
do a special report.

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:40.060
And so that's the other type
of acronym that you see there

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:45.250
S-P-E-C-I, and that's if the
weather is changing a lot.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.500
That's usually a bad thing.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:49.372
You don't like weather
changing frequently.

00:09:49.372 --> 00:09:51.580
It's probably not something
you want to be flying in,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.180
but maybe the conditions
are deteriorating,

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.000
the wind or the
conditions or the ceiling

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.620
has changed
significantly, so they'll

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.540
update that information.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.070
So there are a whole bunch
of different abbreviations

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.050
when you read these reports.

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.580
I highlighted a couple in red.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.570
You could make your way
through sort of guessing, OK,

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.430
thunderstorms is TS.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.440
It seems kind of
intuitive, but I

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.410
highlighted some that are
really, really kind of get you.

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:25.030
So hail is GR and mist is BR,
as someone was pointing out

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.630
on this side.

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:29.750
Yeah, so mist, if you just look
at it and you try to think,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.610
oh, is it broken?

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.435
No, broken is BKR.

00:10:32.435 --> 00:10:34.185
So they just try to
trick you with that's,

00:10:34.185 --> 00:10:37.185
so try to keep an eye
on those, and it's

00:10:37.185 --> 00:10:38.890
good to refresh your
memory on these.

00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:44.790
So this is an example
of a METAR report.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.310
So it starts off
with the location

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.220
and then the first
two numbers, the 16,

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:53.440
are telling you that it's
a 16th day of the month.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.030
And then it's followed by
1653, so that's the time

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.950
and has a Z for time in Zulu.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:03.570
We already talked about
how you subtract hours

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.570
depending on Eastern standard
time versus Daylight Time

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:08.440
to get to the current time.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.430
And then instead of telling
you a heading of the wind,

00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.530
in this case, it has variables.

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:17.070
So sometimes, it will say winds
variable at about four knots,

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.840
in this case.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.700
And then the next
is the visibility,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.090
so 10 SM is standing
for 10 statute miles.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:25.620
And then, in this
case, the ceiling

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.860
is overcast, overcast at 6,000.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:34.830
The next two numbers,
you see the 14 slash 07?

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:39.990
So that's talking about the
temperature and the dew point.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.680
So who remembers
what is dew point?

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.196
Yes.

00:11:48.196 --> 00:11:49.821
AUDIENCE: The
temperature where the air

00:11:49.821 --> 00:11:51.717
reaches saturation for water.

00:11:51.717 --> 00:11:53.550
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So we
heard the temperature

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.250
where the air reaches
saturation for water.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.130
So what happens when the dew
point and the temperature

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:00.940
are very close to each other?

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.470
So here, we have seven
degrees Celsius for dew point,

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.840
14 degrees Celsius
for temperature.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.890
What if the dew point
and the temperature

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.850
were much closer, only
a couple degrees apart?

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:12.350
Yes.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.517
AUDIENCE: Clouds would form.

00:12:13.517 --> 00:12:15.750
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah,
it can be very humid.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.050
You could be inside of a cloud
or heavy fog or precipitation.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.610
Exactly.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.390
So here's a good source
of weather information.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.400
So you can go to
AviationWeather.gov

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.100
and they have a bunch of
menu options up there.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.130
So if you click on METAR
right here, this METAR button,

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.870
it will take you
to a place where

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:40.300
you can request the METAR data.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.680
And it asks for an ID, so
that's the airport identifier.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.780
So in this case, I
wrote in KBED which

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.940
is Bedford airport,
Hanscom field that we

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.420
keep referring to.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.700
And then you can actually tell
it to decode the data for you.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.800
So as much as you
want to memorize

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.340
all of these different codes and
symbols, in general practice,

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:03.100
you can hit decode it
and it'll tell you that.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.100
You can look up at the
time, so you can actually

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.080
ask for weather
data in the past.

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.850
And you could include a TAF.

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:10.990
What does TAF mean?

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.526
Yes.

00:13:14.526 --> 00:13:15.520
AUDIENCE: Terminal
area forecast.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.187
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Terminal area forecast.

00:13:17.187 --> 00:13:18.190
That's right.

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:22.550
So if you do that and you hit
Enter, it gives you this data.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:24.970
So first thing it
does is it tells you

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:28.570
the date at which it's
producing the data for you.

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.910
And then the first is the METAR
and the second here is the TAF.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.535
And so the METAR here is
telling you the location,

00:13:36.535 --> 00:13:38.380
so it starts with KBED.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.800
And then here is
the information raw,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:46.150
so you see that data right here
or you can have it decoded.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.370
So again, the first
two numbers 23--

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.360
that's the date--

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:55.060
20 23rd, and then it gives
you the time in Zulu.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:56.800
And then they
basically go forward

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.120
with all that information.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.180
So it it's defined it here
because it's decoded, so you

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.200
see the temperature, dew point.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.530
So I actually just
updated this this morning

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:10.000
so you could see the weather
and what it's looking like.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.290
Now I'll go over to the
Document Viewer for a moment.

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:31.540
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Oh,
probably don't want the light.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.170
Or maybe we probably need this.

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.510
OK.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.290
Qualified personnel are here.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:44.180
I'll entertain you.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.110
That first METAR was from PDK.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.760
Anybody know where that is?

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:51.390
KPDK.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.034
Southerners?

00:14:54.034 --> 00:14:54.760
AUDIENCE: DeKalb.

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.010
PHILIP GREENSPUN: DeKalb, yes.

00:14:56.010 --> 00:14:57.480
Peachtree DeKalb in Atlanta.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:02.460
It's the Teterboro or
Hanscom Field of Atlanta.

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:06.150
I landed there once
in a Diamond Star.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:09.480
I had to have the wings
taken off in Florida

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:11.250
to fix a fuel gauge.

00:15:11.250 --> 00:15:14.250
I took off from there
and I filed a VFR flight

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.100
plan, landed in
DeKalb, and I forgot

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:19.410
to close my VFR flight plan.

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:23.430
So the FAA and flight
service folks at the time,

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.530
they start searching for
me and calling everybody.

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.710
And they called the tower at
DeKalb and they said, hey,

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.123
did you see 505 whiskey tango?

00:15:30.123 --> 00:15:32.040
And they said, no, we
hadn't seen an airplane.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.890
And I really freaked out.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.630
And I was right
there on the ramp.

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:40.740
So I kept silencing
my phone because I

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.910
was at a barbecue
place with my friend

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.510
and didn't want to be disturbed.

00:15:45.510 --> 00:15:48.210
Anyway, so they called the
mechanic who took the wings off

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.780
and they told him like
the aircraft was missing.

00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:54.640
He had some choice words for me.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.050
So now, whenever I activate
a VFR flight plan usually,

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:00.090
if I do a flight
plan at all, its IFR.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.290
They close that for
you automatically.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.095
I move my watch from my
left wrist to my right

00:16:05.095 --> 00:16:06.720
as a reminder to
close the flight plan.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:07.387
All right, Tina.

00:16:07.387 --> 00:16:09.780
Take it away.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.120
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So this
is the ForeFlight app.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:14.550
I've passed the iPad
around a couple times,

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.840
so I think you guys have
gotten to play with it.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:19.710
This is just a setting where
the blue dot is showing where

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.780
we currently are,
and I've actually

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:28.030
overlaid one of those instrument
flight plans on top going here.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.920
So this is it an instrumented
approach to Bedford.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.830
But if I wanted to get
this weather data here,

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:38.040
I can go to Airports
and pull up the airport

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.400
that I'm looking for.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:44.850
And then click on this Weather
and it shows me the METAR.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:49.140
So it has both the raw data
there and then it depicts it.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.530
And again, blue is
showing marginal VFR,

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.760
and so it explains that.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.990
What's also nice is it tells you
the weather at nearby airports,

00:16:57.990 --> 00:16:59.500
as well.

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.890
And then you can
also go to your TAF,

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.960
your terminal area
forecast, and you

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.880
can look at how that
is changing over time.

00:17:10.935 --> 00:17:13.560
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Oh, Tina, you
don't mind, click on MOS, also.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.190
Yeah, if you're
planning travel, MOS

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:17.881
is good because it gives you
weather a few days in advance

00:17:17.881 --> 00:17:19.839
so you can decide whether
or not it makes sense

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.510
to depart here on
Friday and hope

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.930
to come back VFR on Sunday.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.369
TINA SRIVASTAVA: MOS is
talking about the models, so

00:17:27.369 --> 00:17:30.832
the weather models and
what the outputs are.

00:17:30.832 --> 00:17:33.040
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I think
it stands for Model Outputs

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:36.010
Statistics, not very helpful,
but anyway, it's a longer--

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.230
ForeFlight and Garmin Pilot
and some other sources,

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.940
like WeatherSpork,
will turn that

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.060
into a sort of a
virtual TAF for you

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.250
that lasts three days
instead of just 24 hours.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:49.377
30 for the big airports.

00:17:49.377 --> 00:17:51.460
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So another
type of weather report

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.100
is a PIREP or a pilot report.

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.610
And so this is where a
pilot could be flying

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.340
and wants to report the
condition, so for example,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.170
turbulence or icing.

00:18:02.170 --> 00:18:04.690
Those are types of things
that are frequently

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.610
reported by pilots.

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.160
And you can actually
report one, as well.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.850
So one time when you're getting
your flight instruction,

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:17.290
if you do notice a wind
shear, turbulence, icing,

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:21.430
try to see if you can actually
provide your own PIREP.

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:23.620
And it'll ask you
certain information

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.680
such as your location, the
time, the altitude at which you

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.290
experienced it, what
type of aircraft.

00:18:29.290 --> 00:18:32.590
I think that's really
relevant because, for example,

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:37.150
wind shear experienced by a
small Cessna is one thing.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:41.350
If a large aircraft, like a
big jet, a JetBlue aircraft,

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:43.180
is telling you that
they have wind shear,

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.530
I'd really pay attention.

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:46.390
If they seem to have
trouble with it,

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:48.848
that means you're definitely
going to have trouble with it.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:54.070
And then you could also have
printed weather forecasts

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.110
that tell you-- so we
just talked about the TAF

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.760
as an example.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.920
And as Philip was just saying,
it only goes out 24 hours.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:07.005
So same type of
information as a METAR

00:19:07.005 --> 00:19:09.990
and similar abbreviations.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:14.260
And then we were just talking
about that those models,

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:19.440
and so you can forecast
even farther out if need be.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.440
You can also get a forecast
for a general area.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.740
So this is what we
were discussing earlier

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.210
when we were
talking about radios

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.975
and you might want to call in
and ask for a weather forecast

00:19:30.975 --> 00:19:33.500
or weather brief for
a given flight plan.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:36.263
We talked about how you'd call
in, give your tail number,

00:19:36.263 --> 00:19:38.180
where you were starting,
where you were going,

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:42.020
about how much time is out
you'd be en route or in flight.

00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:43.790
And then, they might
tell you the weather

00:19:43.790 --> 00:19:48.570
for the general area as well
as the local current readings

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:50.378
as well as the forecasts.

00:19:50.378 --> 00:19:52.670
PHILIP GREENSPUN: And notice
that these area forecasts,

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:54.950
if you go to the page
on AviationWeather.gov,

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:57.680
they're now only available
for two or three regions,

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.190
like the Gulf of Mexico.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:02.780
They used to have them for
all over the continental US

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.580
and they included cloud
tops, which was very useful.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.640
The forecast top of
the cloud because if it

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.590
was, say, 4,000 feet,
you would know that

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.410
as long as you get
on top of those IFR,

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.020
you're not going to pick
up any ice because you'll

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.010
be above the clouds.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.900
And now you have to try to
tease that out of the MOS data

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:22.970
sources or use something
like WeatherSpork

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:26.520
that tries to depict graphically
where the clouds are.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.372
I think ForeFlight's
Profile View will also

00:20:28.372 --> 00:20:29.330
try to do some of that.

00:20:33.192 --> 00:20:35.650
TINA SRIVASTAVA: You can also
get forecasts of winds aloft.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.480
We talked about
that a couple times.

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.660
And so this will tell you kind
of what the winds are going

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:43.660
to be at a particular
altitude, for example,

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:47.470
at 3,000 feet or
6,000 feet, and so it

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:49.990
helps you estimate especially
in a cross-country flight

00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:51.880
or a longer flight
how long it might

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.890
take for you to get there.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.740
On apps, such as
ForeFlight, if you--

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.980
in fact, we'll just do that
right now so you can see.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.330
So you can actually
enter in a flight plan

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:21.710
very quickly, so you can
have a starting place.

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:34.713
And then-- so where do
you guys want to fly to?

00:21:34.713 --> 00:21:36.597
AUDIENCE: Boston Logan.

00:21:36.597 --> 00:21:38.930
TINA SRIVASTAVA: That's a
pretty short flight, but sure.

00:21:46.423 --> 00:21:48.590
PHILIP GREENSPUN: You guys,
if you have the patience

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.500
to stay with us tomorrow
afternoon starting at 3:00,

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.930
the founder of ForeFlight's
going to be here,

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:57.008
and I'm sure you'll get
a pretty thorough demo.

00:21:57.008 --> 00:21:59.300
He and a colleague are going
to talk for a couple hours

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:02.360
about first the app,
and also the startup,

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.128
and then some of the
engineering behind it.

00:22:05.128 --> 00:22:06.920
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So
the blue dot is showing

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:08.960
where we are here at MIT.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.430
But of course,
generally, you'd be

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:12.350
doing this when
you're at Bedford

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:15.770
and you're flying to Logan.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:18.650
And then here,
it's telling you it

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:21.380
wants to know about
the aircraft that I'll

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:25.910
be flying in order to calculate
some of the information.

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.910
But when you do these types
of things with the flight,

00:22:28.910 --> 00:22:33.380
it can estimate kind of how
long you'll be in flight.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.000
And you can provide what is
the altitude at which you

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.180
want to fly.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.960
And then it will be able to--

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.260
so it says coloring
based on winds aloft.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.580
It looks like it's not
detecting that maybe because I

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.070
haven't given it all
of its data right now.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:54.170
So in terms of what that means
is just that the winds aloft

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.180
are a good way of
helping you predict

00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:58.580
how long it's going to take
you to get to certain places.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.980
And it'll be part of that
cross-country planning

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:01.945
that you'll have to do.

00:23:01.945 --> 00:23:03.320
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
The winds aloft

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.430
forecast also shows you the
temperature, which is critical

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.920
because that's going to
tell you whether icing is--

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.657
icing is not possible if it's
above freezing, generally.

00:23:15.475 --> 00:23:17.100
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
There are also a bunch

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.643
of severe weather reports.

00:23:18.643 --> 00:23:20.310
Philip has already
talked about a number

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:25.660
of them, AIRMETs and SIGMETs,
as he was talking about.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:29.610
And then they have different
abbreviations, even more

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.500
abbreviations, related to this.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.740
So what they mean for
icing and turbulence.

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:38.400
So here we'll look at some
examples of an AIRMET.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.580
And in the picture,
it shows a broad area

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.570
where that AIRMET is valid.

00:23:43.570 --> 00:23:47.520
And so this is talking about
icing and freezing level.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.630
So SIGMETs also talk
about hazardous weather

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:56.160
such as icing, turbulence,
volcanic ash, which

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.830
I don't think you'll
encounter very often,

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:02.220
but it was an issue in
Europe, for example.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:04.680
And then here's a
breakdown of decoding

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.410
a SIGMET, as an
example, to show you

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:11.460
the type of information,
what it stands for,

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.400
and you can read through
these to understand

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.935
the adverse weather.

00:24:15.935 --> 00:24:17.310
And certainly, if
you're planning

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.800
your own cross-country
flight, I recommend

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:23.160
you also use your normal
weather data sources, as well.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.160
So just turn on the Weather
Channel or Weather.com or Accu

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.380
Weather, whatever you
use on a regular basis.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.590
If it's a crummy day, it's
probably not a good day

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:33.480
to go flying anyway
and you may not

00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.630
want to dive so deep into
all of these different tools.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.770
But if it seems like
a nice day, then I

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:43.080
would really recommend
diving more specifically

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.143
into understanding if
there's a front coming in

00:24:45.143 --> 00:24:46.185
or other types of issues.

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.280
And then, convective SIGMETs
are really, really concerning.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.710
So there are things that are
much more severe, so you're

00:24:54.710 --> 00:24:56.900
talking about
thunderstorms, hail,

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.340
some things you
really don't want

00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.680
to be flying during at all.

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:05.250
There's a lot of different
ways that the weather is also

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.710
produced not in a text form
but in a graphical format.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:12.600
So this is a relatively
complicated weather depiction

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.140
chart.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.398
So we'll break it
down in detail.

00:25:15.398 --> 00:25:17.440
But let me just tell you
some of the main things.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.350
Do you have the--

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:20.950
oh, I left it over there.

00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:23.510
Thanks, Phillip.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.140
So can anyone guess what
all the little circles are?

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.910
We see some circles
that are white

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:30.260
and some circles that are black.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.593
Does anyone know what those are?

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.715
Any guesses?

00:25:39.715 --> 00:25:40.840
AUDIENCE: Weather stations?

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.610
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Weather stations?

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:43.450
Good guess.

00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.220
So it's actually
trying to tell you

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.770
what the cloud cover is like.

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:55.590
So you can see certain places
where the circle is empty.

00:25:55.590 --> 00:26:00.580
It's a clear day when
it's fully filled in,

00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:02.020
that it's showing
the cloud cover.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.490
And then you see some that
are like little pie chart,

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:06.400
so that they're
partially filled in.

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.710
So the purpose of looking
at a weather chart like that

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:15.963
is just to get the
general conditions.

00:26:15.963 --> 00:26:17.380
There's a lot of
different things.

00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:20.280
So here, it's more
specific so it breaks down

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.750
that the circles indicate
the percent cloud cover.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.080
So if it's a quarter filled,
it saying few clouds.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:28.670
If it's 3/4 filled, it's broken.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:30.720
And then it also
has shaded areas

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.910
that depict when you
have the IFR conditions.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.800
So zooming in, you
can just kind of

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.380
see those circles a
little bit bigger,

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:44.235
and the charts provide a
lot of information, as well.

00:26:44.235 --> 00:26:45.610
But you can see
a little bit more

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.820
clearly also here some
of the circles that

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.770
are like pie charts
that's showing

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:54.100
how much they're filled in and
what the cloud cover is looking

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.030
like.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:58.150
And again, you can actually
get the same type of thing

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.800
on your ForeFlight.

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.300
It's basically an option.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.890
For every airport
that it depicts,

00:27:02.890 --> 00:27:06.720
it can show this
cloud cover, as well.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.030
And you can also look at
a radar summary chart.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:11.970
There are a bunch
of prog charts,

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.943
so they talk about when
you're looking at a front.

00:27:15.943 --> 00:27:17.610
You guys have seen a
lot of these things

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.120
on the Weather Channel, probably
didn't pay attention to them

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.160
very much, but it's
good to understand

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.810
what the different
types of fronts are,

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:28.560
what's happening across
the country, more than just

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.670
your particular region.

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:31.420
So if you're planning
you know if it's a--

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.860
I think today's a Wednesday, so
if you're planning on a flight

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:36.450
this upcoming
weekend and you want

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.033
to think about what's
going to happen,

00:27:38.033 --> 00:27:39.742
basically, you're
trying to see are there

00:27:39.742 --> 00:27:40.890
some fronts coming in?

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:41.640
What's happening?

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.090
Or is it likely to
going to be a clear day?

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.490
And then, of course, as we've
talked about, all of these

00:27:47.490 --> 00:27:50.340
have good legends
just like we talked

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:53.670
about the sectional
chart quite a bit

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.200
and the details of the legend.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.300
It's always good to
take a look at how

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.970
they have indicated these
different lines, where

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:00.960
the fronts are.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.270
And you really want to
know which ones, again,

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:05.520
are reporting the actual
conditions versus which

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:09.210
is a guesstimate of what's
going to happen in six hours, 12

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:10.410
hours from now.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.080
Again, if it's a forecast,
it could be wrong.

00:28:15.583 --> 00:28:17.500
And then this is just a
little bit more detail

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.880
of types of things you
can see on a chart.

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.890
I think the most
important thing to look at

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.460
is this weird little
R symbol with kind

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.980
of an arrow at the bottom.

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.720
It's indicating thunder.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.120
So that's a big one
to look out for.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.430
If you see that, it's
probably not something

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:35.810
you're interested in flying in.

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:36.790
I'm not, for sure.

00:28:40.148 --> 00:28:41.940
And then, there are a
couple of shards here

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:44.550
that are not
specifically on the--

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:47.010
usually going to be asked
about, but it's good to see.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:49.510
So you might have seen these
kind of surface analysis

00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:50.010
charts.

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.890
And they talk about high
pressure areas and low pressure

00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:53.760
areas.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.737
And so that high
and low pressure,

00:28:55.737 --> 00:28:56.820
what are we talking about?

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:00.060
So that's the same thing is that
pressure that you're dialing

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.720
into your altimeter, right?

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.910
So we talked about
29.92, but there

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.400
might be a day where it's
really dropped very low

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:11.640
and it's 28 or something
very, very low.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:13.590
That means you're in
a low pressure area.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.470
And if it's very high,
you're at 30 point something,

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.470
it's a higher pressure area.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.660
And if you see that as
you're flying around

00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:25.500
that pressure setting is
getting updated very rapidly

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.450
and changing
rapidly, that usually

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.550
is related to a change in
your overall weather system.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.790
So you really want to be
aware if that number is

00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:36.150
changing quite a bit,
that's a big problem.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.640
You can also take a look at
when you get into your airplane

00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.290
and you're first
setting that dial

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.790
when you're sitting
on the ground,

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.743
see how much it's changing.

00:29:44.743 --> 00:29:47.160
You might want to-- in general,
when you get into a plane,

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.448
I like to think about when
the plane was last flown.

00:29:50.448 --> 00:29:52.740
There are parts where you
are checking the oil that you

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.870
can kind of generally
feel the engine

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.450
and see if it's warm or not, if
it needs to be primed or not,

00:29:57.450 --> 00:29:58.710
those types of things.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:01.020
If you see that the
plane has just been flown

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:04.110
and you're really dramatically
having to change that pressure

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:06.180
setting, that means the
weather has recently

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.278
changed quite a bit.

00:30:07.278 --> 00:30:08.820
It makes you want
to really make sure

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:11.790
that your projections and your
knowledge about the weather

00:30:11.790 --> 00:30:12.540
is still accurate.

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:15.123
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Tina, you want
to mention these numbers here

00:30:15.123 --> 00:30:16.910
are the metric equivalent.

00:30:16.910 --> 00:30:25.095
So instead of 2 99 and 2, you'll
see 1,000 millibars or so.

00:30:25.095 --> 00:30:26.970
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So we
have a bunch of these.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:29.230
And all of these are also
on that first website,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:31.075
the AviationWeather.gov.

00:30:31.075 --> 00:30:34.570
You can look at actually
seeing the clouds

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.130
from a satellite picture
and kind of just seeing

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:38.530
what's going on.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.540
These are hopefully
not the first time

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:44.140
you've seen these
types of charts before.

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.940
And then this is a way that they
like to depict the winds aloft.

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.090
So these little lines,
and then depending

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:54.870
on how many lines are
coming off the side,

00:30:54.870 --> 00:31:00.190
it indicates how strong that
wind is and what the amount is.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.740
So you can see
here some that have

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.450
a lot of little
dashes coming off

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:05.940
of it, whereas some
that don't have any.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:09.720
It's a way to very quickly see
where the wind is very strong

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.240
and where it's not.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.450
And this is what I had
talked about last time when

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:18.710
we're in the radio section, the
radio ATC and communications

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.520
section.

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.790
But just as a reminder, this
is the number that you can call

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:25.287
and you can get your full
weather briefing done there.

00:31:25.287 --> 00:31:27.620
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Tina, do
you want me to take over now?

00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:29.273
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Sure.

00:31:29.273 --> 00:31:30.440
PHILIP GREENSPUN: All right.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.840
So thank you.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.260
Tina covered the stuff
that requires a brain.

00:31:36.260 --> 00:31:41.090
Now, I'm going to just tell you
about how do you get this stuff

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.817
as a practical matter.

00:31:42.817 --> 00:31:44.900
You can call this phone
number it's very good when

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.900
you're a novice pilot.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.330
Again, think about crew
resource management.

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:54.290
The weather briefers are another
person that you can pull in.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:56.225
They may say VFR
flight not recommended.

00:31:56.225 --> 00:31:57.350
That's there at the bottom.

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:58.725
That's worth paying
attention to.

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:03.540
They used to work for the FAA.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.750
They were outsourced in
2005, and now they're

00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:08.300
contractors from a
company called Leidos,

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.615
so you might hear
the name Leidos.

00:32:10.615 --> 00:32:12.740
You can get a full weather
briefing over the phone.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:17.270
I actually do this sometimes
if I'm in an Uber on my way

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:18.470
to the Gaithersburg airport.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.840
I'll just call the
weather briefer

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.520
and that makes life very easy.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.020
OK.

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:27.720
So AviationWeather.gov,
as we mentioned earlier,

00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.160
has all the chart that we saw.

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.630
The weather briefers
themselves run

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:36.050
their own website, which is a
little bit of a twist on that.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:38.060
I kind of like this
site, actually,

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:40.008
because you get to set
up a home page where

00:32:40.008 --> 00:32:41.300
you pick your favorite airport.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.000
So I picked Bedford,
Teterboro which

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.230
is where you go in the
New York Metro area

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:53.150
if you enjoy paying $8 or
$9 a gallon for gasoline.

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:58.430
And then Dulles Airport where
the two competing FBO's also

00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.935
charge about $9 a
gallon for gasoline.

00:33:00.935 --> 00:33:02.870
But anyway, they'll
have the METARs

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:06.230
for your favorite airports
and the TAFs and all this,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.640
and you can set up these charts.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.872
So basically, as
soon as you log in,

00:33:09.872 --> 00:33:12.080
you get a whole bunch of
current weather information.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.780
That's kind of a nice
feature for this website.

00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.100
And it is free.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:20.780
They will give you, just like
AviationWeather.gov, they'll

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:21.710
give you the METAR.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.990
Here's one for Bedford
from the other day.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.390
I guess that's from the 21st.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:26.230
Yeah.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.490
The wind was 310.

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:35.060
So it was on the 21st at 0256
Zulu, so it was late at night,

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.530
early in the morning in London.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:40.930
Wind was 310 at 18
knots, gusting 25,

00:33:40.930 --> 00:33:43.400
10 miles of visibility, clear.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.860
Temperature was
minus 11, dew point

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:49.725
minus one niner, altimeter
two niner, four seven,

00:33:49.725 --> 00:33:50.600
and there's a remark.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.750
The peak wind was 310 at 31
knots and that happened at 0225

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.960
Zulu time.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.460
OK.

00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:01.370
There are private websites.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:04.850
The most popular free one is
probably fltplan.com at least

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.280
among the turbine crowd.

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:10.850
They have very accurate models
for a lot of jet powered

00:34:10.850 --> 00:34:12.860
or turboprop aircraft.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.989
And they have some
example briefings

00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:16.610
that I think I do
want to show you.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:26.639
OK.

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:28.719
Again, you'll have
access to this.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:31.318
So one nice thing
about fltplan.com

00:34:31.318 --> 00:34:34.260
is they start you
off with a nav log.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:37.620
Remember, we talked about that?

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:40.739
And in the nav
log, they tell you

00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:46.219
what magnetic course to steer.

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:46.719
Oh, sorry.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:49.010
They give you the
magnetic course?

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:50.590
Sorry, magnetic course is 303.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.440
I guess they don't give you the
wind correction angle, or maybe

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.150
the wind's right in our faces.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:57.030
No, it's not.

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.610
Maybe this is not
such a great site.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:00.150
All right.

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.150
Well anyway, they tell
you roughly how long it's

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.680
going to take you to get there.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.980
And they will calculate
your ground speed for you.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.010
So I think I put in the
Piper Warrior or something,

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:15.810
so this is a pretty low
airspeed, 124 knots.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:22.423
And you can see at the
different altitudes

00:35:22.423 --> 00:35:23.840
how much fuel
you're going to burn

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.340
and how long it's
going to take you.

00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.480
So there's really not
a lot of difference.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.550
You can see here, you
could go at 10,000 feet

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.260
and take 58 minutes.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:36.080
You could go at 4,500 feet
and it would take you an hour.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.390
So there's not a
lot to choose from.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.120
Your airspeed goes up a little
bit as you climb higher,

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.655
but the wind is also
a little bit stronger.

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:49.380
They're giving you the
weather to go from Bedford

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.330
to Bennington, Vermont.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:54.540
Giving you a little bit of
information about the runways.

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.380
You can look at the
approaches there.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:03.940
Departure airport
forecast, so look at this.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.450
Departure airport NOTAM, so
they did a pretty good job here.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:09.880
They pulled out the
most important NOTAM.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:11.530
They were doing snow clearing.

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:13.990
So at Bedford, they said,
look, runway 112 niner

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:17.230
is closed except with one
hour of prior permission

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:19.180
to this phone number.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:20.590
Now how about that?

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.940
Look at all those other NOTAMs.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.830
You can really get
lost because they're

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:26.230
telling you about stuff--

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:32.570
taxiway-- Let's go here.

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:37.640
Taxiway November edge markings
obscured maybe by this snow.

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:38.720
I don't know why.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.030
Anyway, that's probably
not really important.

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:44.750
That maybe is taxiway that
you're not even going to use.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.410
So this is actually a pretty
good computer program, I think,

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:50.758
because they put that
closed runway NOTAM right up

00:36:50.758 --> 00:36:52.550
at the top where you
might actually see it,

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:54.490
and they put it in boldface.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:58.350
Anyway, so that's a
fltplan.com weather briefing.

00:36:58.350 --> 00:37:01.475
Let's see how ForeFlight
presents the same information.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.600
You saw that before.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.970
They also give you this wind
temperature and turbulence.

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.640
Oh, this is to a different spot.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.269
This is to Gaithersburg.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:23.790
Significant weather from
flight level 250 to 630.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.400
Not going to be able to use that
in the Cirrus, unfortunately.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.830
That's up above 25,000 feet.

00:37:29.830 --> 00:37:31.030
We get the METARs.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.070
It looks like, sorry,
the METARs and TAFs.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.940
So we get our METAR
for Hanscom and it

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.750
looks like they put in
boldface the relevant portion

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:41.500
of the TAF.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:43.900
So they're saying, look,
at your flight time,

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.693
this is the one
that's going to apply.

00:37:45.693 --> 00:37:47.860
It's going to be better
than six miles of visibility

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.990
but overcast at 800, so not
a bad IFR situation as long

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:55.780
as you can handle any icing.

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:58.470
They've color coded
a bunch of stuff.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:02.115
So you can see here at
Worcester, they've got--

00:38:02.115 --> 00:38:03.600
well, that looks pretty nasty.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.270
They're forecasting, for
example, wind 030 at 11 knots,

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:14.400
only half a mile of visibility.

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.260
Tina, help me out.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.040
What's minus PL?

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.950
Freezing fog.

00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:21.210
I don't know what minus
PL is, but it sounds bad.

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.037
Overcast 500.

00:38:22.037 --> 00:38:23.370
So they're calling that low IFR.

00:38:31.410 --> 00:38:32.540
Where are the NOTAMs?

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.248
Let me see what they
did with the NOTAMs.

00:38:34.248 --> 00:38:37.180
I think it was the same day.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.170
Ice pellets.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:39.130
OK.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.960
Well, we don't want that.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.480
So this is an interesting thing.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.800
ForeFlight kind of missed--

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:49.910
I think it was out
there, maybe it's here.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:50.410
OK.

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:53.908
So up at the top, it says
runway 523 is closed,

00:38:53.908 --> 00:38:56.200
which normally wouldn't bother
me at all because that's

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.783
the crosswind runway
and we don't like

00:38:57.783 --> 00:38:59.560
to use it unless we have to.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:06.210
Maybe that NOTAM was not out at
the time that I got this one.

00:39:10.730 --> 00:39:13.080
Yeah, there's nothing
about that PPR.

00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:16.680
I guess they hadn't started
plowing the snow at that time.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.960
Anyway, so the
NOTAMs are important.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.300
They can tell you
if the airport is

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:24.450
having some kind of
construction going on.

00:39:24.450 --> 00:39:30.180
Mobile apps-- ForeFlight is
for the iPhone or iPad only.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.850
That's a major difference
between ForeFlight and Garmin

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:33.840
Pilot.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:35.840
NavMonster is a fun, free app.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.160
It works at least on iOS, I
think on Android, as well.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.860
That gives you a
lot of good stuff.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.197
WeatherSpork is all
three platforms.

00:39:45.197 --> 00:39:47.280
So we're just going to
show you ForeFlight in case

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.710
you're not able to come to the
talk tomorrow starting at 3:00.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:56.310
Here's a little
flavor of ForeFlight.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.890
Notice that in the
airport information

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:01.860
page here on the left,
they highlight the fact

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.410
that runway 523 is
closed by NOTAM,

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:06.300
so they're making an
attempt to pull out

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.840
the most significant runways.

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:09.090
But actually, they missed one.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:10.710
Look at this.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:13.950
Runway 112 niner is also
closed except for this one hour

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.150
prior permission.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:19.020
Somehow that exception didn't
get the software excited.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.610
So if you showed
up, actually this

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:22.800
is a good example
of when you might

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.180
want to run your
minimum fuel burn,

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.680
maximum endurance airspeed.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.028
So you get to the airport and
you didn't check the NOTAMs

00:40:32.028 --> 00:40:33.570
or maybe it was a
newly issued NOTAM.

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:35.370
And they tell you
the runway's closed

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.380
and it won't reopen
for another half hour.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.760
So in that case, you're going
to go out and loiter somewhere

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.310
until the airport
reopens unless you

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:45.990
want to land somewhere else.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:47.790
OK.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:51.690
The next page is
apparently about NOTAMs.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.970
And over on the right,
we have the weather

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:55.835
which Tina already showed you.

00:40:55.835 --> 00:40:57.210
And you see the
density altitude?

00:40:57.210 --> 00:40:58.560
Look at that.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:01.470
It's minus 2,500 feet.

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:05.670
It's 2,500 feet below sea
level at Hanscom Field.

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:09.480
ForeFlight can give you the
TAF and the MOS, as I said.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.360
So this was, I think, on Sunday.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.740
And have a look there.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.480
We're getting the
weather for Wednesday,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.850
so we can plan our
trip to return--

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:19.583
what's today, Wednesday?

00:41:19.583 --> 00:41:21.000
And look, the MOS
is pretty right.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:21.690
It's nice.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:23.340
It's not too much wind.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:27.480
190 at 5 knots,
overcast below 12,000.

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:29.010
Here's Garmin Pilot.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.790
Garmin really believes in
the old white on black,

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:35.580
like a 1970s monitor.

00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:38.220
ForeFlight will actually flip
into sort of a style like this

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:41.190
at nighttime.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:47.190
And this one, it doesn't
highlight for you.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:49.578
It's the same time as
I was using ForeFlight,

00:41:49.578 --> 00:41:51.120
and nowhere in here
does it highlight

00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:54.420
that that runway 523 is
closed or that two niner is

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:56.100
having any kind of issue.

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.330
I think it was the same time.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.050
I could be wrong.

00:41:58.050 --> 00:41:58.710
Yeah, see?

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.600
523 closed.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.930
Runway 1129 closed except
one hour prior permission.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:06.510
So you're fat, dumb, and
happy looking at this page,

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:08.820
getting all ready to
go to Hanscom Field,

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.920
and then if you don't
check the NOTAMs,

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.750
you discover that
there's no runway.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:16.080
So another good reason to
always have some reserve fuel

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.940
and not overcommit to your plan.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:19.440
All right.

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:21.540
In-flight weather sources.

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:25.110
There's something called TWEB,
transcribed weather broadcasts.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.500
You might be asked
about it on the exam.

00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.540
I doubt it.

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:35.310
Anyway, that's my friend
Eric, again, with his DC-3.

00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:38.520
If you were flying
a DC-3 in its prime,

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.740
you might have heard of TWEB.

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.930
HIWAS is still
being broadcast off

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.930
of certain VORs that are
indicated on the chart.

00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:50.280
So look at this, see that H
symbol there in the middle?

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:53.700
That H symbol tells you that
if you tune in to this VOR

00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:55.680
and tell your audio
panel in the airplane

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.910
that you want to actually listen
to whatever is being modulated,

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:04.500
that you'll hear this
pre-recorded weather

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.510
announcement about
maybe thunderstorms

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:07.840
in a certain area.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.050
You can call Flight
Service Enroute.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.030
They're very helpful.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:13.980
They'll take a PIREP
from you and they'll

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:15.642
tell you what is going on.

00:43:15.642 --> 00:43:17.850
They can call your mom if
you're going to be late due

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:20.130
to forecast headwinds.

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:24.563
I was actually flying through
New York on my way to DC,

00:43:24.563 --> 00:43:25.980
and there were
horrible headwinds.

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:28.480
I was in a Diamond Star, which
was not a very fast airplane,

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.390
so when you've got
a 50 knot headwind,

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:34.750
you slow down to a
Honda Accord speeds.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:37.020
So I asked New York
for a frequency change

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.437
to Flight Service and they
said, well, why do you need it?

00:43:39.437 --> 00:43:41.610
And I said, well, I want
to have them call my mom

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.190
and tell her I'm
going to be late.

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:44.940
And they said, oh, we
can do that for you.

00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:48.870
So in between vectoring the
airbus's out to Germany,

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:50.592
they were calling my mom.

00:43:50.592 --> 00:43:52.050
I think each
controller in New York

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:55.050
has an assistant right
next to him or her

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:59.560
and that was who actually
made the phone call.

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.170
TINA SRIVASTAVA:
Just quick note.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:02.430
The last point there.

00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:04.780
So Flight Service can
accept your PIREP.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.200
So when we talked about
how you should make a pilot

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.850
report or a PIREP, you can
call them and tell them,

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.063
hey, I experienced turbulence.

00:44:12.063 --> 00:44:13.980
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I think
if it's really ugly,

00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:19.033
the controllers can also put
it in, like if it's icing or--

00:44:19.033 --> 00:44:20.700
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Wind
shear they usually

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.190
accept cause wind shear
is such a bad thing,

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:24.720
and you're fighting
the wind shear

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.345
and trying to deal
with the wind shear,

00:44:26.345 --> 00:44:29.283
so they'll usually
except that PIREP.

00:44:29.283 --> 00:44:30.450
PHILIP GREENSPUN: All right.

00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:31.940
NEXRAD.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:35.370
So this is an actual
photo of our Cirrus

00:44:35.370 --> 00:44:37.990
screen on our way to Oshkosh.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:39.990
So remember, I showed you
that one earlier which

00:44:39.990 --> 00:44:42.340
with the track from FlightAware.

00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:49.300
So we had planned to go from
Rutland, Vermont, oh, sorry.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.190
We had planned, I guess, yeah,
we came up with a new plan.

00:44:52.190 --> 00:44:56.580
We really wanted to go from
Bedford over to Syracuse,

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.850
and I think initially we
decided that going to Rutland

00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:05.390
would keep us away
from the rain.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:07.550
The NEXRAD radar, what
they're really seeing

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.660
is water in the clouds.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.110
So they can actually see rain.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:14.510
They can't see a cloud
that's just vapor

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:18.440
and it's going to produce
a rain storm at some point.

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.350
They're really seeing the
big water droplets of rain.

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:22.880
Anyway, so we
elected to fly over

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.250
here and refuel at
Watertown, New York

00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.620
instead of at Syracuse.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.545
Oksana was on that flight.

00:45:29.545 --> 00:45:30.920
We flew through
some of that rain

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.450
and it actually
was pretty smooth.

00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:34.460
So we probably could have
just charged through,

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:36.520
but we took a more
conservative route.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.020
OK.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.560
So NEXRAD data,
instead of paying

00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:43.550
for a receiver in your airplane
and then paying a subscription

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:47.660
fee, the FAA give you
NEXRAD data as well

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.210
as a bunch of other stuff,
like some text weather data.

00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:52.670
That's another good reason
to be able to read METARs

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.628
because if you're looking
at it in the cockpit,

00:45:54.628 --> 00:45:56.240
it could be on a
pretty small display

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.150
and the raw format is very
compact and actually very

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:02.690
convenient for in-flight use.

00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:05.910
Anyway, here's a little diagram
of how it's transmitted.

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:08.990
You have to have this--

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:11.930
you have to have-- let's
see if we talked about this.

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:16.610
Yeah, so you have to have a
UAT receiver to get these data.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:19.550
The aircraft position,
see the big airliner

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:25.880
transmitting on 1090 megahertz
extended squitter it's called.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.090
That's fine, but you need
to be able to receive

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:34.070
on 978 megahertz, which is this
alternative frequency that I

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:35.990
guess had more
bandwidth available.

00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:38.780
And that's where the FAA
can push all these data

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.240
up to you, like about
other traffic, even traffic

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:44.330
who doesn't comply with
ADS-B. Although by January

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:50.630
1st of next year, almost
everybody will have ADS-B out

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.760
at least.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.570
Anyway, so that the feds
are pushing this stuff up

00:46:56.570 --> 00:46:57.980
to your airplane.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:00.222
I'm going to turn it over
to Tina now to talk about--

00:47:00.222 --> 00:47:02.430
TINA SRIVASTAVA: Yeah, so
I just added in this slide.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:05.660
This is the one that we
had been talking about.

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:09.830
If you're in a plane that does
not have the ADS-B receiver

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:12.590
but you want to receive
that information so that you

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:16.070
get real-time weather
information or real time

00:47:16.070 --> 00:47:18.740
traffic information,
you can actually

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.020
make that happen by
building it yourself.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:21.950
And I did that.

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:24.020
It really doesn't
take very long.

00:47:24.020 --> 00:47:26.660
If you want to seem
really cool, you

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:30.200
can go and buy just a
regular Raspberry Pi

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.488
and a couple different parts.

00:47:31.488 --> 00:47:33.530
And also that link will
show you how you can just

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:35.780
buy a little kit where they've
put everything together

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:36.800
and you just buy it.

00:47:36.800 --> 00:47:38.780
It's very easy to assemble.

00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.610
So it just has a little
Raspberry Pi inside.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:45.230
And it has a little cooling fan,
and then it has these antennas.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:47.820
The Stratics
Software is actually

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.850
kind of free, open
source software,

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:50.960
and it's really great.

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.260
And it syncs up to
your other apps.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:57.080
So for example with
ForeFlight, it just

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.530
shows up like a Wi-Fi
signal that you connect to.

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:02.750
And then while you're
in the air, when

00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:05.520
you don't have
access to this data,

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:07.040
this will actually update.

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.970
So you can see on the right
is kind of a zoomed in picture

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:12.080
from ForeFlights.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:14.720
So it shows that you
can see the weather

00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:16.730
on the bottom left
corner and then

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:21.900
you also see these little
pictures that show traffic.

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:23.990
So yeah, exactly.

00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:27.140
So on the further bottom
right, you can also see--

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.230
it just shows you other
airplanes, other traffic,

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:32.455
and kind of the altitude
that they're at.

00:48:32.455 --> 00:48:33.830
And so it's really
useful I think

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.860
it's kind of nice to have,
especially in a little airplane

00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:39.410
to have that visibility and
knowledge that you're not just

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:43.880
relying on Flight Service
giving or kind of like a area

00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:46.190
controller giving you
traffic advisories,

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.740
but you can see it in advance.

00:48:48.740 --> 00:48:51.200
We're about to dive
into human factors,

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:55.250
and Philip has talked a lot
about using the person sitting

00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:58.460
next to you whether they
are actually a pilot or just

00:48:58.460 --> 00:48:59.810
a friend.

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:02.780
Even just a friend can sit
there and hold the iPad

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.120
and see the little blue traffic.

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:07.790
And then when they hear on the
radio that's someone saying,

00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:09.980
hey, it looks like
in this situation,

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:13.460
no traffic, 3 o'clock, you're
trying to look for that plane.

00:49:13.460 --> 00:49:15.740
Well, they can have a
little sense of, OK, yeah,

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.570
it's near that,
and they can help

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:19.470
you find the other aircraft.

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:20.465
So it's very helpful.

00:49:20.465 --> 00:49:22.840
PHILIP GREENSPUN: How much
were the parts for that, Tina?

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.410
TINA SRIVASTAVA: It's like $80.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.820
PHILIP GREENSPUN: OK.

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:25.320
Yeah.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:27.620
So the ones that you can buy
commercially all packaged,

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.730
like the Stratux--

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:30.890
I think this is a
play on Stratus.

00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:33.040
This is one of the
competitors in that market.

00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.980
They're anywhere from
$400 to $1,000, I think.

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:42.530
The commercial ones also have
an electronic gyro in there

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:45.410
and AHARs, attitude
heading reference system.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:49.290
So they can actually give you on
your iPad an attitude indicator

00:49:49.290 --> 00:49:53.770
and some information about
your speed and so forth.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:54.270
All right.

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:58.090
So this is a reminder
that, again, all those data

00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:02.700
are intended to help you
fly within the VFR weather

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:04.800
minimums, which provide
a good margin of safety.

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:13.480
I put this $20 magazine
up here for you guys

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.000
because this whole
talk has really

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.190
been about software and
different ways of spinning

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.760
the same data.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.302
So this is everything, in case
you're not a core six major.

00:50:23.302 --> 00:50:24.760
This is everything
you need to know

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:29.247
to become a programmer
in one $20 magazine.

00:50:29.247 --> 00:50:31.330
TINA SRIVASTAVA: So we're
running a little behind.

00:50:31.330 --> 00:50:33.580
So I'm going to go
straight to human factors.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.080
While I'm pulling
it up, let Phillip

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.760
know if you have
any more questions.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.510
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah,
anything going on?

00:50:40.714 --> 00:50:43.315
AUDIENCE: How do you know
if your weather briefing is

00:50:43.315 --> 00:50:45.980
adequate with all these sources
out there and you're not good.

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.840
I'm just not really sure.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.590
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
That's a great question.

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:51.965
How do you know if you're a
weather briefing is adequate?

00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:54.500
The professional weather
briefers at Leidos,

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:59.290
at 1-800-WX-BRIEF, they tend to
go a little above and beyond.

00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:02.330
They'll give you NOTAMs about
any VOR that's out of service

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.120
on your route of flight, even if
you're navigating with the GPS.

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:10.340
So if you're at all unsure,
just do your self-service stuff

00:51:10.340 --> 00:51:13.640
online, and then just call
1-800-WX-BRIEF and ask

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.760
for a full briefing.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.670
It won't take you
more than 10 minutes,

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:19.930
and you will definitely
be at least--

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:22.058
you'll probably be over
briefed, at that point.

00:51:22.058 --> 00:51:23.600
They'll tell you
about an unlit tower

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.380
even if you're flying
at noon, and there's

00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:30.710
no possibility of it being dark
and the lighting on the tower

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:33.160
making a difference.

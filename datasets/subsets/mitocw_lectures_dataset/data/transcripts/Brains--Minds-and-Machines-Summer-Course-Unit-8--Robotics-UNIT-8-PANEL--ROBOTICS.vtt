00:00:22.497 --> 00:00:24.580
PATRICK WINSTON: Well, I
suppose my first question

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.600
has to do with some remarks
that Tony made about Rod Brooks.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.150
I remember Rod Brooks' work
for the one great idea he had,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.640
which was the idea
of subsumption.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.410
And the idea of
subsumption was to take

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.870
the notion of
procedural and data

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.760
abstraction from
ordinary programming

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.890
and elevate it to
a behavior level.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.550
And the reason
for doing that was

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.180
that if you weren't working
so well at one level,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.860
you would appeal
to another level

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.250
to get you out of trouble.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.030
So that sounds like a
powerful idea to me.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.260
And I'm just very interested
in what the panelists construe

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.810
to be the great
principles of robotics

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.540
that have emerged since then.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.200
Are there great
principles that we

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.150
can talk about in a classroom
without just describing

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.322
how a particular robot works?

00:01:15.322 --> 00:01:16.780
STEFANIE TELLEX:
So we were talking

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.180
about this ourselves
a little bit

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.330
and sort of asking ourselves
what makes a systems paper?

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.770
And what do you
write down in one

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.950
of those papers as
these general principles

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.630
that you extract from
building a system?

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.671
Because it seems like
there's two kinds of papers

00:01:30.671 --> 00:01:33.130
in robotics-- the systems
paper, where you said,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.690
I built this thing and
here's kind of how it works.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.390
Where it's hard to extract,
I think, general principles

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.041
from that.

00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:40.790
It's like, I built
this and this and this,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.790
and this is what it did.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.780
Here's a video.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.109
But it does something
amazing, so it's cool.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:48.400
And then there's, like, kind
of algorithm papers, which

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.130
tend to get more citations
and I don't know.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.580
And they usually
work because they

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.970
have this chunk of knowledge,
subsumption architectures,

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.730
RRT Star's one of my
favorite examples.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.150
It's the kind of paper,
there's an algorithm,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.525
and then there's math that
shows how the algorithm works,

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:04.900
some results that they show.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.509
And there's this nugget that
transfers from your brain--

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.460
to the author's
brain to your brain.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.500
And I think it's hard to
know what that nugget is when

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.624
you've built a giant system.

00:02:16.624 --> 00:02:18.790
One of the things that I've
been thinking about that

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.206
might be what that
might look like

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.450
is kind of design
patterns for robots.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.180
This is a concept from
software engineering.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.430
It's at a higher level
abstraction than a library

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.790
or something that you share,
but it's things about the ways

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.510
that you put software together.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.030
So if you're a
hacker, you probably

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.539
heard of some of these patterns
like singleton and facade

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:38.080
and strategy.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.600
They have these sort of
evocative names from this book,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.175
Gang of Four is the nickname.

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:45.280
And I think there's a set of
design patterns for robotics

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.560
that we are slowly discovering.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.710
So when I was hanging out
in Seth Teller and Nick

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.740
Roy's for my post-doc, there
was one that I really got

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.994
in my head, which was
this idea of pub/sub--

00:02:56.994 --> 00:02:57.910
publish and subscribe.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.970
You're talking about
YARP and LCM and Russ.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.370
They all had this
idea that you don't

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.191
want to write a function to
call to get the autodetection

00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:07.690
results.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.910
You just want you detector
blasting out the results

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.090
as fast as it can all
the time, and then break

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.150
that abstraction.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.649
And you get a lot of robustness
in exchange for that.

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:17.440
I think that's a design
pattern for robots.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.650
I think there's probably
about 30 more of them.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.680
And I bet Russ
knows a lot of them.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.510
And Albert and Ed-- there's
people who know them maybe,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.719
but they're not written down.

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.176
I think one thing I'd like to
do is write some more of them

00:03:29.176 --> 00:03:29.770
down.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.255
Sorry I didn't.

00:03:31.255 --> 00:03:33.340
PATRICK WINSTON: Russ,
what do you think?

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.799
Your talk seemed to focus on
optimization as the answer.

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.340
RUSS TEDRAKE: It's
a framework that I

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.670
think you can guess a lot of the
problems and get clear results.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.760
I think looking across you can
point to clearer sort of ideas

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.880
that worked very well.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.690
So I think for estimation
Bayes Rule works really well.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.240
And you know, Monte
Carlo estimation

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.656
has worked really
well for planning

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:01.780
in high dimensional spaces.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.570
Somehow randomization
was a magical bullet

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.180
where people start doing
RRT-type things as well

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:10.870
as trajectory
optimization-type things.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.930
I do think that the open
source movement and the ability

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.790
to write software and
components and modules

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.290
has been a huge, huge thing.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.910
And I do think that at the
low-level control level

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.070
is optimization-based
controllers

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.670
have been a magical thing.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.040
I think any one of these--

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.660
in any one of these
sub-disciplines,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.120
you can point to a
few real go-ahead

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.050
ideas that have
rocked our world,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.210
and everybody gets behind them.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.000
You know, I think maybe
the biggest one of all,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.880
actually, has been LIDAR.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.220
And then the ability--

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:50.560
I think sensing has really come
online and been so enabling

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.440
in the last few years that
I think if you look back

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.390
at the last 15, 20
years of robotics,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.930
the biggest point
changes I think

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.480
has been with the sensors--
sensors upped their frame rate

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.710
resolution, gave depth.

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.410
When LIDAR and Kinect came out,
those just changed everything.

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.660
PATRICK WINSTON: Before we
leave the subject of Brooks

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.640
and subsumption, Tony,
you brought it up,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.280
and there was a little
exchange between you

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.720
and Russ about why
it might be useful.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.850
I noted that both Russ and
John talked about two--

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.340
one respect-- one
each major blunders

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.956
that their machines made.

00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:32.260
Do you construe that
any of Brooks's stuff

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.940
might have been
useful in avoiding

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.756
those kinds of blunders?

00:05:36.756 --> 00:05:37.880
TONY PRESCOTT: Potentially.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.240
But I think these are really
challenging things that we're

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.610
trying to do with these robots.

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.280
So the biomimetic approach
that I take, I think,

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.260
is partly I want to mine
biology for insights

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.840
about how to solve problems.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.590
And the problems
that we're realizing

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.630
are hard in robotics
are the problems that

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.230
are hard in biology as well.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.250
So I think we
underestimated the problem

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.390
of manipulating objects.

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.830
But if you look in biology,
what other species apart from us

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.670
has really solved that problem
to the level of dexterity?

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.146
An octopus trunk, maybe but--

00:06:16.146 --> 00:06:18.530
sorry, elephant trunk.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.324
So I think that these
challenges take a--

00:06:23.324 --> 00:06:25.490
prove to be much more
difficult than we might think.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.690
And then other things
that intuitively seem hard

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.040
are actually quite easy.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.550
So the path that we're taking in
some of our biomimetic robots,

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.530
like the MiRo robot toy is to
do stuff which actually people

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.300
think looks hard, but it's
relatively easy to do,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.420
and these are solvable problems.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:48.100
And then we can progress towards
what are obviously the harder

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.650
problems, and where
the brain has dedicated

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.270
a lot of processing power.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:55.780
And I think object manipulation,
if you look in the brain,

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.600
is massive representation
for the hand.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.860
And there's all these extra
motor systems in cortex that

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.230
aren't there in non-mammals.

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:08.570
And even in simpler mammals
they don't have motor cortex.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.720
We've developed all
these extra motor

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.960
cortical areas, direct
corticospinal projections.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.530
All of this is dedicated to
the manipulation problem.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.910
So I think we're finding out
what the hard problems are

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.830
by trying to build the robots.

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.290
And then we can maybe find
out what the solutions

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.880
are by looking at the biology.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.340
Because in that case,
particularly, you

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.470
have low level systems for--

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.560
that can do grasp, and
that are there in reptiles.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.950
And then you have these
additional systems in mammals,

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:40.510
and particularly
in primates, that

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.250
can override the
low-level systems to do

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.009
dexterous control.

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:46.800
PATRICK WINSTON: John,
you look like you're

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.590
eager to say something.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.756
JOHN LEONARD: I just want
to talk about subsumption,

00:07:49.756 --> 00:07:51.790
because it had such a
huge effect on my life

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.600
as a grad student.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.580
It was sort of like
the big thing in 1990

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.380
when I was finishing up.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.650
But I really developed
a strong aversion to it,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.800
and so I tried to argue with
Rod back then, but not very

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.930
successfully.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:06.070
I would say, when will
you build a robot that

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.390
knows its position?

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.580
And he would say, I
don't know my position.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.740
But I think some of the
biological evidence,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:14.200
like the grid cells
and things that maybe

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.180
at an autonomic
subconscious level

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:20.490
there is sort of position
information in the brain.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.690
But subsumption,
I think, as a way

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:24.760
of trying to strive
for robustness where

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.010
you build on layers,
that's a great inspiration.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.750
But I feel that the intelligence
without representation

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:34.929
sort of work that Rod
did, I just don't buy it.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.419
I think we need representation.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.289
PATRICK WINSTON: I guess
there are two separable ideas.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:38.570
JOHN LEONARD: Yes.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.361
PATRICK WINSTON: The
no representation idea

00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:41.380
and the layering idea.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:41.580
JOHN LEONARD: Yeah.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:43.030
I like the layering,
and I'm less

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.234
keen on the no representation.

00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:47.110
RUSS TEDRAKE: I'm
curious if Giorgio--

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.419
I mean, you showed
complicated system diagrams.

00:08:49.419 --> 00:08:51.460
And you're obviously doing
very complicated tasks

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.730
with a very complicated robot.

00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:54.855
Do you think-- do you see
subsumption when you look

00:08:54.855 --> 00:08:55.570
at those--

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.320
GIORGIO METTA: Well,
it's actually there.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.470
I don't have time to
enter into the details.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:04.850
But the way it's
implemented, ER,

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.480
allows you to do
subsumption or other things.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.710
There's a way to
physically take the modules

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.560
and, without
modifying the modules,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.680
connect them through scripts
that can insert logic

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.430
on each module to sort of
preprocess the messages

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.970
and decide whether to subsume
one of the module or not,

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.800
or activate the
various behaviors.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.580
So in practice, can be a
subsumption architecture,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:37.480
a purer one or whatever other
combination you have in mind

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.920
for the particular task.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.961
RUSS TEDRAKE: Maybe a
slightly different question

00:09:40.961 --> 00:09:42.700
is did the subsumption
view of the world

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.325
shape the way you
designed your system?

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.260
GIORGIO METTA: It may have
happened without knowing,

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:56.720
because that piece of software
started at MIT while I

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.650
was working with Rod.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:02.010
But we didn't try to build
the subsumption architecture

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.530
in that specific case.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.255
But the style, maybe of
the publish-subscribe

00:10:07.255 --> 00:10:10.410
that we ended up
doing was derived

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.800
from subsumption in a sense.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.660
Was in spirit, although
not in the software itself.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:23.900
But going back to whether
there's a clear message that we

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.480
can take, certainly
I will subscribe

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:31.730
to Stefanie message of the
recyclable software, the fact

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:34.190
that we can now
build these modules

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.020
and build large architectures.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:38.780
This allows doing experiments
that we never dreamed

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.130
of until a few years ago.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:46.420
So we can connect many
powerful computers

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.580
and run vision and
control optimisation

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.340
very efficiently, and especially
if recycling the software.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.227
So you don't have to implement
inverse kinematics everyday.

00:10:58.227 --> 00:11:00.310
PATRICK WINSTON: Well, I
think the casual observer

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.470
this afternoon, one
good example being me,

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.540
would get the sense that,
with the exception of Tony,

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.200
the other four of you are
interested in the behavior,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.890
but not necessarily interested
in understanding the biology.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.195
Is that a misimpression
or is that correct?

00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:20.570
And when you mention LIDAR,
for example, that's something

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.560
I don't think I use.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.780
And it's doing something--

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.550
it's enabling a robot
with a mechanism

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:27.260
that is not biological.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:31.160
So to what degree are any of
you interested in understanding

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.329
the nature of
biological computation?

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:36.870
JOHN LEONARD: I care
deeply about it.

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.050
I just don't feel I have
the tools or the bandwidth

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.040
to really dive into it.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.080
But every time I talk to Matt
Wilson I leave feeling in awe,

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.470
like I wish I could clone myself
and hang out across the street.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.180
GIORGIO METTA: Well--

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:53.680
Yeah.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.977
Go ahead.

00:11:54.977 --> 00:11:56.060
STEFANIE TELLEX: I get it.

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.140
I kind of feel the same.

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.140
I mean, I'm an engineer.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:58.780
I'm a hacker.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:59.650
I build things.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.381
And I think that's
the way that I

00:12:02.381 --> 00:12:04.380
can make the most progress
towards understanding

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.140
intelligence is by
trying to build things.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:10.180
But every time I talk
to Josh, you know,

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.277
I learn something new,
and Noah and Vikash.

00:12:14.277 --> 00:12:15.610
PATRICK WINSTON: Say that again?

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:18.068
STEFANIE TELLEX: Every time I
talk to Josh and Noah Goodman

00:12:18.068 --> 00:12:21.280
and Bertram Malle, people from
the psychology and cognitive

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.890
science [INAUDIBLE],,
I learn something

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:25.980
and I take things away.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:29.502
But I don't get excited about
trying to build a faithful

00:12:29.502 --> 00:12:31.710
model that incorporates
everything that we know about

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.084
the brain, because
I just don't--

00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:36.180
I can't put all
that in my brain.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:38.604
And I feel that I'm better
guided by my engineering

00:12:38.604 --> 00:12:40.020
intuition and the
things that I've

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.840
learned by trying
to build systems

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.185
and seeing how that plays out.

00:12:44.185 --> 00:12:45.893
PATRICK WINSTON: On
the other hand, Tony,

00:12:45.893 --> 00:12:50.220
you are interested in biology
and you do build stuff.

00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.120
TONY PRESCOTT: Yeah.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.203
I'm interested in it,
because I trained originally

00:12:53.203 --> 00:12:53.970
a psychologist.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:59.250
So I came into robotics in
order to build physical models.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.110
PATRICK WINSTON: So
why do you build stuff?

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:06.810
TONY PRESCOTT: Because I think
the theory is the machine.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.920
Our theories and
psychology and neuroscience

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.560
are never going to be like
theories are in physics.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.310
We're not going to be
able to express them

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:18.270
concisely and convince people
of them in a short paper.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:20.190
We're going to be able
to, though, build them

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:24.300
into machines like
robots and show people

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.270
that they do behavior,
and hopefully

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.604
convince people that way that
we have a complete theory.

00:13:29.604 --> 00:13:31.645
PATRICK WINSTON: So it's
a demonstration purpose?

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:32.750
Or a convincing purpose?

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.280
TONY PRESCOTT: It's
partly to demonstrate

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.140
the sufficiency of the theory.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.420
I think that's the big reason.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:44.160
But another motivation that
has grown more important for me

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:49.310
is to be able to ask
questions of biologists

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:50.790
that that wouldn't
occur to them.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.920
Because I think the
engineering approach--

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.560
you're actually
building something--

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.890
raises a lot of
different questions.

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:01.680
And those are then
interesting questions

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.580
to pursue in biological studies
and questions that might not

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:08.660
occur to you otherwise.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.950
So I go back to
Brightenburg's comment

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.320
that when you try to
understand a system,

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.970
there's a tendency to
overestimate its complexity,

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.350
and that when you
do synthesis that's

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.810
a whole lot different
from analysis.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.090
And actually, with
the brain, we tend

00:14:24.090 --> 00:14:27.540
to either underestimate or
overestimate its complexity

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.200
and we rarely get it right.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.130
So the things that we
think are complex sometimes

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.690
turn out to be easy.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.910
So an example would be
in our whisker system,

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:41.792
it's really quite easy to
measure texture with a whisker.

00:14:41.792 --> 00:14:44.250
And there's lots of different
ways of doing that that work.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.640
But intuitively you might
not have thought that.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.440
But getting shape
out of whiskers

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.660
is harder, because
it's an integration

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:55.170
problem across
time, and you have

00:14:55.170 --> 00:14:57.300
to track position and
all these other things.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.340
So these things
turn out to be hard.

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.980
So I think trying to build
synthetic systems helps

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:07.560
us understand what are the
real challenges the brain has

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.437
to solve, and that's
interesting for me.

00:15:09.437 --> 00:15:11.520
PATRICK WINSTON: Is there
an example of a question

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.615
that you didn't know is
there when you started?

00:15:13.615 --> 00:15:13.940
TONY PRESCOTT: Yeah.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:15.315
PATRICK WINSTON:
And you wouldn't

00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:17.160
have found if you hadn't
attempted to build?

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:18.360
TONY PRESCOTT: So
when we started

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.920
trying to build
artificial whiskers,

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.710
the engineers that
were building the robot

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:26.250
said, well, how much power
does the motor have to have

00:15:26.250 --> 00:15:28.110
that drives the whisker?

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.910
I mean, what happens when the
whisker touches something?

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.700
Does it continue to move and
bend against the surface?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.190
Or does it stop?

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:38.822
And well, we said we'll look
that up in the literature.

00:15:38.822 --> 00:15:40.530
And of course, there
wasn't an experiment

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.180
that answered that question.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:44.760
So at that point we said, OK,
we'll get a high speed camera

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.920
and we'll start watching rats.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.350
And we found that when
the whiskers touch,

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.220
they stopped moving
very quickly.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:52.840
So they make a light touch.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.371
And intuitively, yeah, maybe--

00:15:56.371 --> 00:15:57.620
because we make a light touch.

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:00.840
Obviously, we don't bash
our hands against surfaces.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.340
But it's not
obvious, necessarily,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.310
when you have a flexible sensor
that that's what you would do.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.000
And in some
circumstances, the rats

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.420
allow their whiskers to
bend against objects.

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:13.200
So understanding when you make
a light touch and when you bend

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.080
was really a question that
became important to us

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.640
after we'd started
thinking about how

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.810
to engineer the system.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.675
How powerful do the
motors need to be?

00:16:20.675 --> 00:16:22.800
PATRICK WINSTON: I'm very
sympathetic to that view,

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.420
being an engineer myself.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.729
I always say if
you can't build it,

00:16:26.729 --> 00:16:28.020
you don't really understand it.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.020
TONY PRESCOTT: Yeah.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:30.280
PATRICK WINSTON: So
many of you-- all of you

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.140
have talked about
impressive systems today.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.270
And I wonder if any
of you would like

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:39.625
to comment on some problem
you didn't know that was there

00:16:39.625 --> 00:16:41.250
and you wouldn't have
discovered if you

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:49.769
hadn't been building the kinds
of stuff that you have built.

00:16:49.769 --> 00:16:51.060
RUSS TEDRAKE: It's a long list.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.720
I mean, I think we
learn a lot every day.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:57.280
Let me be specific.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.520
So with Atlas, we took a
robot to a level of maturity

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.760
that I've never taken before.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.119
I see videos from companies
like Boston Dynamics

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.650
that are extremely impressive.

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:14.430
I think one of the things that
separates a company like that

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.790
from the results you
get in a research lab

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:21.540
is incredible amounts
of hours, sort

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:25.560
of a religion to data logging
and analysis, and sort

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:31.760
of finding corner cases,
logging them, addressing them,

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:32.760
incremental improvement.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.500
And researchers
don't often do that.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.474
And actually, I
think a theme that,

00:17:36.474 --> 00:17:37.890
at least in a
couple of the talks,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.730
was that maybe this is
actually a central requirement.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.650
And in some sense,
our autonomy really

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.110
should be well
suited to doing that,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:49.500
to maybe automatically
finding corner cases

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.880
and proving robustness
and all these things.

00:17:51.880 --> 00:18:01.080
But the places that broke
our theory were weird.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.620
I mean, so the stiction
in the joints of Atlas

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.000
is just dominant.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.500
So we do torque
control, but we have

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.958
to send a feedforward velocity
signal to get over friction.

00:18:09.958 --> 00:18:13.170
If we're started at zero
and we have to start moving,

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.390
if we don't send a
feedforward velocity signal,

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.780
our model is just
completely wrong.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.570
When you're walking
on cinder blocks

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:25.600
and you go near the
ankle limit in pitch,

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:27.600
there's a strange coupling
between the mechanism

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.980
which causes the ankle to roll.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.896
And it'll kick your robot
over just like that,

00:18:30.896 --> 00:18:32.120
if you don't watch for it.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.380
And we thought about
putting that into our model,

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.420
addressing it with
sophisticated things.

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.050
It's hard and ugly and gross.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:42.636
And it's possible, but
we do things to just--

00:18:42.636 --> 00:18:44.010
you know, Band-Aid
solution that.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:48.570
And I think there's all this
stuff, all these details that

00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.920
come in.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.140
I think the theory
should address it all.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.580
I think we did pretty well.

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.170
I'd say we got 80%
of the way there,

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.810
70%, 80% of the way there
with our theory this time.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:18:59.970
And then we just decided
that there was a deadline

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.077
and we had to cover some
stuff up with band-aids.

00:19:02.077 --> 00:19:03.160
But that's the good stuff.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.985
That's the stuff we
should be focused on.

00:19:04.985 --> 00:19:07.110
That's the stuff we should
be devoting our research

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.890
efforts on.

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.890
PATRICK WINSTON: If you were
to go into a log cabin today

00:19:10.890 --> 00:19:14.451
and write a book on Atlas
and your work on it,

00:19:14.451 --> 00:19:16.700
what fraction of that book
would be about corner cases

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.800
and which fraction would
be about principles?

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.992
RUSS TEDRAKE: We really stuck to
principles until last November.

00:19:24.992 --> 00:19:25.950
That was our threshold.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:27.870
November, we had to send
the robot back for upgrades.

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.120
We said, until then, we're
going to do research.

00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.580
The code base is
going to be clean.

00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.060
And then when we got the
robot back in January,

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.430
we did everything we needed
to to make the robot compete

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:40.710
in the challenge.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:43.030
So I think 70% or 80% of
the way, we got there.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.210
And that it was just
putting hours on the robot,

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.370
finding those screw cases.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.860
And then, if I were to
write a book in five years,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.582
I hope it would be--

00:19:51.582 --> 00:19:54.329
PATRICK WINSTON: Is there a
principle on that ankle roll?

00:19:54.329 --> 00:19:54.870
Or was that--

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:55.350
RUSS TEDRAKE: Oh, absolutely.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.240
We could have thrown
that into the model.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.240
It just would have increased
the dimensionality.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.180
It would have been
a non-linear term.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.625
We could have done it,
we just didn't have time

00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:04.500
to do it at the time.

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.300
And it was going to
be one of many things

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.700
we would have had to do if
we had taken the principle

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:10.260
approach throughout.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.480
There's other things that
we couldn't have put nicely

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.690
into the model, that we
would have needed to address.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.970
And that should be our agenda.

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:21.060
TONY PRESCOTT: If that
was your own robot,

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.990
would you have just
re-engineered the ankle

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.830
to make that problem
less of an issue?

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.510
RUSS TEDRAKE: It
wasn't about the ankle.

00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:29.010
It was about the fact
that there's always

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:30.690
going to be something
unmodeled that's

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.940
going to come up and get you.

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.700
And with robots, I think
we're data starved.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.670
We don't have the big data
problem in robotics yet.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:40.890
And I think you're
limited by the hours you

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:41.970
can put on your robot.

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:46.050
We need to think about
how do you aggressively

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.180
search for the cases that
are going to get you?

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.350
How do you prove robustness
to unmodeled things?

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.650
I think this is fundamental.

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:58.350
It's not a theme I would
have prioritized if I hadn't

00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:59.569
gotten this far with a robot.

00:20:59.569 --> 00:21:01.860
PATRICK WINSTON: But Giorgio,
what about building iCub?

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:04.410
Were there big
problems that emerged

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.650
in the course of building
that you hadn't anticipated?

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:10.160
GIORGIO METTA:
Well first of all,

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.020
there's a problem of power.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.640
I guess for Atlas
it's very different.

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:19.710
But for electric motors,
you're always short of space,

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:23.340
short of space where
to put the actuators.

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.790
And you start filling
the available-- if you

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.860
have a target size, you start
filling it very quickly.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:32.890
And there's no room
for anything else.

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.270
And then you start sticking the
electronics wherever you can,

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:40.020
and cables and everything.

00:21:40.020 --> 00:21:46.500
Certainly if-- I
mean, a difference

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:52.270
in design from the biological
actuators and the artificial

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:55.060
actuators to make
life very difficult.

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:58.570
And especially when you
have to go through something

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:00.370
like a hand, where
you like to have

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:01.930
a lot of degrees of freedom.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.340
But there's no way you
could actually build it,

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:07.990
so you have to take
shortcuts here and there.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.480
And I guess the same is
true, then, for computation.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.960
And you resort to putting
as many micro-controllers

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.940
as you can inside the
robot, because you

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.130
want to have efficient
control loops.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.730
And then you say, well,
maybe have a cable

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:28.480
for a proper image
processing because there's

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:31.740
no way you can squeeze
that into the robot itself.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.220
It's not surprising.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.260
It's just a matter of when
you're doing to design,

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:39.670
you soon discover that
there are limitations

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.400
you have to take into account.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.280
I don't know whether
it is surprising.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:46.030
I mean, I guess we
learn the lesson

00:22:46.030 --> 00:22:48.610
across many years of design.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.960
We designed other
robots before the iCub.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:53.290
We sort of--

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:56.730
I thought we knew
where the limits where

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.024
with the current technology.

00:22:58.024 --> 00:22:59.440
PATRICK WINSTON:
I wonder if the--

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.570
you say you learned
a lot building iCub.

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:06.790
I wonder if this
knowledge is accessible.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:08.670
It's knowledge
that you discussed

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.450
in meetings and seminars,
and thought about at night

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:13.760
and fixed it the next day.

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.400
Is any of it--

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.970
if I wanted to build iCub
and couldn't talk to you,

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.505
would I have to
start from scratch?

00:23:22.505 --> 00:23:24.880
I know you've got the stuff
on the web and whatnot, but--

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:25.120
GIORGIO METTA: Yeah.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:26.304
That's probably enough for--

00:23:26.304 --> 00:23:27.720
PATRICK WINSTON:
--reasons in them

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.594
GIORGIO METTA: Sorry?

00:23:28.594 --> 00:23:30.880
PATRICK WINSTON: Your
web material has designs,

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.290
but it doesn't have reasons.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:33.123
GIORGIO METTA: Yeah.

00:23:33.123 --> 00:23:34.360
Yeah, that's-- that's right.

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:39.190
No, the other thing we
documented the process itself.

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:42.910
So that information,
I don't know,

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.810
resides in the people that
actually made the choices when

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:48.310
we were doing the design.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.650
There's one other thing that
maybe is important, is that--

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:56.290
so the iCub is
about 5,000 parts.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:58.240
And that's not
good, because there

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.730
are 5,000 parts that can break.

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:06.610
And that may be something
interesting for design

00:24:06.610 --> 00:24:11.635
of materials for robots, or new
ways of building the robots.

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:16.390
And at the moment,
basically everything

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:20.000
that could potentially
break has happened,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.150
that it failed on the
iCub over many years.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:30.310
Even parts that theoretically
we didn't think could break,

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.720
well, they could.

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.440
But we estimated
maximum torques,

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.210
whatever, and then it happened.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:41.020
Somebody did something silly
and we broke a shoulder.

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:44.520
It's a steel part
that we never thought

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.550
it could actually break.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:50.080
And it completely failed.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.790
I mean, those type of
things are maybe interesting

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:58.250
for future designs, or
for either simplifying

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:03.490
the number of parts or figuring
out ways of doing less parts

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:08.170
or, let's say, different
ways of actually building

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:09.834
the mechanics of the robot.

00:25:09.834 --> 00:25:11.500
PATRICK WINSTON: I
suppose I bring it up

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.850
because some of us in
CSAIL are addressing--

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.380
not me, but some
people in CSAIL are

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.560
interested in how you
capture design rationale,

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.195
how you capture
those conversations,

00:25:22.195 --> 00:25:24.580
those whiteboard sketches
and all of that sort of thing

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:28.900
so that the next generation can
learn by some mechanism other

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:32.260
than apprenticeship.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.010
But let's see.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.570
Where to go from here?

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.900
iCub is obviously
a major undertaking

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:39.760
and Russ had been
working like a slave

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.590
for three years on Atlas robot.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:47.006
Do you-- I don't know
quite how to phrase this

00:25:47.006 --> 00:25:48.130
without being too trumpish.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.400
But the soldering
time to thinking time

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.950
must be very high on
projects like this.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:58.060
Is that your sense?

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.910
Or do you think that the
building of these things

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:04.690
is actually essential to
working out the ideas?

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.420
Maybe that's not quite the
question I'm going to ask.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:09.880
Maybe a sharper question
is given the high ratio

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.442
of soldering time
to thinking time,

00:26:11.442 --> 00:26:13.150
is it something that
a student should do?

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.150
RUSS TEDRAKE: I'm lucky
that someone else built

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:20.280
the robot for us.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.685
Giorgio has done much more
than we have in this regard.

00:26:23.685 --> 00:26:25.810
PATRICK WINSTON: Well, by
soldering time you know--

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:26.110
RUSS TEDRAKE: I know.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.901
Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:26:26.901 --> 00:26:27.400
We--

00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:28.240
PATRICK WINSTON:
It's a metaphor.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.300
RUSS TEDRAKE: Yeah.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:34.570
but we got pretty far into
it with the good graces

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:38.530
of DARPA and Google
slash Boston Dynamics.

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:41.570
The software is where we've
invested our solder time.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.950
A huge amount of software
engineering effort.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:47.150
I spent countless
hours on setting up

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:48.300
build servers and stuff.

00:26:51.495 --> 00:26:54.510
Am I stronger, you know,
am I better for it?

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:59.230
I think having invested, we
can do research very fast now.

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:04.050
So I'm in a new position
to be able to try

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:06.270
really complicated
ideas very quickly

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.190
because of that investment.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:10.050
It was actually-- I
knew going in what

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:11.340
I was going to be doing.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.980
I saw what John and
other people got out

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:16.972
of being in the Urban Challenge,
including in especially

00:27:16.972 --> 00:27:19.180
the tools, like the LCM that
we've been talking about

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.340
and stuff today.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.500
And I wanted that for my group.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.480
So it was a very
conscious decision.

00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.260
I'm at a place now that we
can do fantastic research.

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:32.130
Every one of the students
involved in great research work

00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:33.887
on the project.

00:27:33.887 --> 00:27:35.970
We hired a few staff
programmers to help with some

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.410
of the non-research stuff.

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.860
And I think the
hardware is important.

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.455
It's hard to balance, but
I do think it's important.

00:27:43.455 --> 00:27:45.830
PATRICK WINSTON: Just one
short follow-up question there.

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.000
Earlier you said that
some of your students

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.430
didn't want to work on it.

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:50.370
And why was that?

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:53.899
Was that a principal reason?

00:27:53.899 --> 00:27:56.190
RUSS TEDRAKE: People knew
how much soldering time there

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.891
was going to be.

00:27:56.891 --> 00:27:57.390
Right?

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:01.830
And the people that had
their research agenda and it

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:03.960
was more theoretical,
and they didn't

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.610
want that soldering time.

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:08.070
Other people said, I'm
still looking for ideas.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:10.230
This is going to motivate
me for my future work.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.140
They jumped right in.

00:28:11.140 --> 00:28:14.537
And super strong students made
different decisions on that.

00:28:14.537 --> 00:28:16.870
PATRICK WINSTON: And they
both made the right decisions.

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:17.360
RUSS TEDRAKE: I think so.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:17.875
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah.

00:28:17.875 --> 00:28:18.250
RUSS TEDRAKE: Yeah.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:18.960
PATRICK WINSTON: But
John, you've also

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.120
been involved in-- well,
the just driving car thing

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.330
was a major DARPA
grand challenge.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.790
Some people have been critical
of these grand challenges

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:29.460
because they say
that, well, they

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:31.290
drive the technology
up the closest hill,

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.207
but they don't get you
on a different hill.

00:28:33.207 --> 00:28:35.040
Do you have any feelings
about these things,

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.740
if they're good
idea in retrospect,

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.360
having participated in them?

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.360
JOHN LEONARD: Let's see.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:43.110
I'm really torn on
that one because I

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.152
see how the short term benefits
of the community-- and you

00:28:46.152 --> 00:28:47.860
can point to things
like the Google car--

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.150
that there's a clear impact.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:53.580
But DARPA does have a
mindset that once they've

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.750
done something, they
declare victory and move on.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.740
So now if you work, say,
on legged locomotion, which

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.030
one of my junior
colleagues does,

00:29:01.030 --> 00:29:02.590
DARPA won't answer his emails.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:04.910
It's like, OK, we did
legged locomotion.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.530
And so I think
that the challenge

00:29:07.530 --> 00:29:10.830
is to be mindful of
where we are in terms

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:13.300
of the real long-term progress.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.810
And it's not an
easy conversation

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:18.745
to have with the
funding agencies, but--

00:29:18.745 --> 00:29:20.370
PATRICK WINSTON: But
what about a brand

00:29:20.370 --> 00:29:22.140
new way of doing
something that is not

00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.990
going to be competitive in terms
of demonstration for a while?

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.540
Is that a problem
that's amplified

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.040
by these DARPA grand challenges?

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.670
I mean, take chess, for example.

00:29:33.670 --> 00:29:36.900
If you had a great idea
about how humans play chess,

00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:40.220
you would never be
competitive with Deep Blue,

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:41.680
or not for a long time.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:43.830
So you wouldn't be
in a DARPA program

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:47.580
that was aimed at doing chess.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:48.777
So is that a--

00:29:48.777 --> 00:29:49.985
do you see that as a problem?

00:29:52.821 --> 00:29:54.570
RUSS TEDRAKE: I think
it's a huge problem.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:56.610
But I still see a
role for these kind

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.880
of competitions as benchmarks.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.860
And I wouldn't do
another one today.

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.890
I mean, for me it
was the right time

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.900
to sort of see how
our theory had gotten,

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.860
try it on a much more
complicated robot, benchmark

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:12.820
where we are, get some
new ideas going forward.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.540
It was perfect for me.

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.190
But you can't set
a research agenda.

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:18.290
JOHN LEONARD: And they're
dangerous for students.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.190
So one of our strongest
students never

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:24.180
got his PhD, because his
wife is in program PhD

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:26.970
program in biology and he
did the DARPA challenge.

00:30:26.970 --> 00:30:28.376
And she finished her thesis.

00:30:28.376 --> 00:30:30.750
And he said, I don't want to
live alone on the east coast

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.010
while she starts her faculty
position in California.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.155
So I'm out of here.

00:30:34.155 --> 00:30:37.446
And that's the sort of thing.

00:30:37.446 --> 00:30:39.570
STEFANIE TELLEX: I kind of
made different decisions

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.980
about that over my career.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:44.790
So when I was a post-doc
at MIT, I really,

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.094
really, really worked
to avoid soldering time.

00:30:47.094 --> 00:30:47.760
I was fortunate.

00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.974
I kind of walked around.

00:30:48.974 --> 00:30:50.890
There's all these great
robot robotic systems.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:52.910
And I would bolt language
on, and get one paper.

00:30:52.910 --> 00:30:55.380
And bolt language on another
way and get another paper.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.340
And you look to get
a faculty position,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.990
you have to have this
focused research agenda.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.200
And so I was focused on that.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:03.880
And it worked.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.180
I think it was a very
productive time for me.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:08.700
But I really valued the
past two years at Brown,

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:12.610
where there's not as much
other roboticists around there.

00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:16.560
So I've really been forced to
broaden myself as a roboticist

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.230
and spend a lot
more time soldering,

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:23.420
making this system for
pick and place on Baxter.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:24.920
The first year I
didn't hack at all,

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.040
and the second year
I started hacking

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.440
on that system, the
one that was doing

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.648
the grasping with my student.

00:31:28.648 --> 00:31:30.570
It was the best
decision I ever made.

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.850
I learned so much
about the abstractions.

00:31:33.850 --> 00:31:36.210
Because the problems
that we needed

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.210
to solve at the beginning,
before I started hacking,

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:40.562
I just didn't understand.

00:31:40.562 --> 00:31:42.270
The problems I thought
we needed to solve

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.853
were not the problems
that we actually

00:31:43.853 --> 00:31:46.326
needed to solve to make the
robot do something useful.

00:31:46.326 --> 00:31:47.700
And I don't think
there's any way

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.180
we could have gotten to that
knowledge without hacking

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:54.090
and trying to build it.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:57.030
GIORGIO METTA: In
our case, we've

00:31:57.030 --> 00:32:00.120
been lucky, in a
sense, that we had

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:07.230
resources in terms of engineers
that could do the soldering.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.500
So at the moment we still
have about 25 people that

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.930
are just doing the soldering.

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:15.070
So it's just a large number.

00:32:15.070 --> 00:32:15.730
Yeah.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:18.540
PATRICK WINSTON: That would
look like a battalion, something

00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:19.363
like that.

00:32:19.363 --> 00:32:21.430
JOHN LEONARD: Can I say
something more generally?

00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:26.190
So there's a lot of claims
in the media and sort

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:29.350
of hyped fears about robots
that take over the world,

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:31.320
or sort of very strong AI.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.020
And partly, they sometimes
they point to Moore's law

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:36.390
as this evidence
of great progress.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:39.570
But I would say that
in robotics we're

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.380
lacking high-performance
commodity robot

00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:46.466
hardware that lets us
make tremendous progress.

00:32:46.466 --> 00:32:48.840
And so things like Baxter are
great because they're cheap

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.131
and they're safe, and they're
a step in that direction.

00:32:51.131 --> 00:32:54.030
But I think we're going to
look back 20 years from now

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:57.870
and say, how did we make any
progress with the robots we

00:32:57.870 --> 00:32:58.680
had at the time?

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:02.790
Like, we really need better
robots that just get massively

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:04.210
out there in the labs.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.414
RUSS TEDRAKE: But--

00:33:05.414 --> 00:33:07.080
TONY PRESCOTT: I was
going to echo that,

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:12.501
because I think robotics is
massively interdisciplinary.

00:33:12.501 --> 00:33:15.840
And you've maybe got people more
towards control here slightly.

00:33:18.946 --> 00:33:20.820
What we're trying to do
in Sheffield robotics

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.670
is actually bringing in more
of the other disciplines

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.760
in engineering, but also
science, social science.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.710
Everybody has a potential
contribution to make.

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:31.680
Certainly electronic
engineering,

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.600
mechanical engineering.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:37.800
Soft robotics, I think, depends
very much on new materials,

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.290
materials science.

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.970
And then these things have
different control challenges.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.580
But sometimes the
control problem

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:48.540
is really simplified if you have
the right material substrates.

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.060
So if you can solve
Giorgio's problem, having

00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:54.605
a powerful actuator, then
his problem of building iCub

00:33:54.605 --> 00:33:55.890
is much simplified.

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:58.200
So I think we have
to think of robotics

00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:01.190
as this large,
multi-disciplinary enterprise.

00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:05.040
And if we're going to build
robots that are useful,

00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.944
you have to pull in
all this expertise.

00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:08.819
And we're interested in
pulling the expertise

00:34:08.819 --> 00:34:11.760
in from social science as well.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.775
Because I think one
of the major problems

00:34:13.775 --> 00:34:16.710
that we will face in
AI and in robotics

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.350
is kind of backlash, which
is already happening.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.070
Do we really want
these machines?

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.300
And how are they going
to change the world?

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.425
Understanding what
the impacts will be

00:34:26.425 --> 00:34:29.520
and trying to
build in safeguards

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:32.471
against the negative impact is
something we should work on.

00:34:32.471 --> 00:34:34.679
PATRICK WINSTON: But Giorgio
had on one of the slides

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.630
that one of the reasons
for doing all this was fun.

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:42.000
And I wonder to what degree
that is the motivation?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.580
Because all of you talked about
how difficult the problems are,

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.420
and some of them are like
the ones you talked about,

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.579
John, watching
that policeman say,

00:34:50.579 --> 00:34:51.870
go ahead through the red light.

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:56.880
Those seem not insurmountable,
but very tough and sound

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.350
like they would
take five decades.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:02.917
So is the motivation
largely that it's fun?

00:35:02.917 --> 00:35:04.500
RUSS TEDRAKE: That's
a big part of it.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.920
I mean, so we've done some
work on steady aerodynamics

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:12.300
and the like, too, and I like--
so we made robotic birds.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:15.150
And I tried to make robotic
birds like on a perch.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:18.180
And then we had a
small side project

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.450
where we tried to show that
the exact same technology could

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.126
help a wind turbine
be more efficient.

00:35:23.126 --> 00:35:24.000
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.860
RUSS TEDRAKE: And that's
the important problem.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.612
I could have easily started off
and done some of the same work

00:35:30.612 --> 00:35:33.070
by saying I was going to make
wind turbines more efficient.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.528
I was going to
study pitch control.

00:35:34.528 --> 00:35:37.420
I'd be very serious about that.

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:38.920
But I did it the
other way around.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:40.806
I wanted to try to
make a robot bird.

00:35:40.806 --> 00:35:42.180
And I think the
win-- not only do

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.989
I get excited going
in, try to make a bird

00:35:45.989 --> 00:35:48.030
fly for the first time
instead of getting 2% more

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.590
efficient on a wind turbine.

00:35:49.590 --> 00:35:52.286
I mean, I go in more
excited, but I also--

00:35:52.286 --> 00:35:53.910
I get to recruit the
very best students

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.120
in the world because of it.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.780
There's just so many
good reasons to do that.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.280
Sometimes it makes me feel a
little shallow because the wind

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.670
turbine's way more important
than a robotic bird.

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:09.274
But that is-- the
fun is the choice.

00:36:09.274 --> 00:36:10.940
PATRICK WINSTON: What
about it, Giorgio?

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:11.670
Do you do it--

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:14.340
or you have a huge group there.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:17.790
Somebody must be paid
for all those people.

00:36:17.790 --> 00:36:23.005
Are they in expectation of
applications in the near term?

00:36:23.005 --> 00:36:23.880
GIORGIO METTA: Sorry.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.921
PATRICK WINSTON: You have
a huge group of people.

00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:27.030
GIORGIO METTA: Yeah.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:31.050
I mean, the group is
mainly funded internally

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:39.440
by IIT, which is public funding
for large groups basically.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.240
And actually, the robotics
program at IIT is even larger--

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.790
the group on the
iCub is actually--

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.200
there are four
PIs working on it,

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:53.970
and collaborations
with other people

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:58.370
like with the
IIT-MIT group also.

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:03.710
But the overall robotics program
at IIT's about 250 people,

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:04.710
I would say.

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:09.120
So they're certainly
also part of the reason

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:13.785
why we've been able to go
for a complicated platform.

00:37:13.785 --> 00:37:17.330
There was one that actually
participated in the DARPA

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:18.950
robotics challenge.

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:24.000
There's people doing quadrupeds
and people doing robotics

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.257
for rehabilitation.

00:37:25.257 --> 00:37:26.340
So there's various things.

00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.673
PATRICK WINSTON: So there
must be princes and princesses

00:37:28.673 --> 00:37:31.680
of science back there somewhere
who view this as a long-term

00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.330
investment that will have some--

00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:35.288
GIORGIO METTA: It was in
the scientific program

00:37:35.288 --> 00:37:36.970
in the Institute to
invest in robotics.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:41.670
And while one day they may
be looking at the results

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:45.020
and see whether we've
done a good job,

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.140
desire to fire us all, whatever.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:51.790
Hey man, that might be the case.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:54.930
And I think it was--

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:58.770
unexpectedly IIT
started in 2006.

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:00.900
And the centrifuge
program include

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:05.550
robotics and all the
hype about robotics

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.180
that started in recent years,
Google acquiring companies,

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:13.290
this and that, I
think in hindsight

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:17.257
has been a good choice to
be in robotics at that time.

00:38:17.257 --> 00:38:18.465
Just by sheer luck, probably.

00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:22.590
RUSS TEDRAKE: To
be clear, I think

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.290
we're having fun but solving
all the right problems while--

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:26.510
I think we just sort of--

00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:27.160
yeah.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.620
We lucked out,
maybe, a little bit.

00:38:28.620 --> 00:38:31.120
But we found a way to have fun
and solve the right problems.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.530
So I don't feel that we're--

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.530
GIORGIO METTA: I think
it's a combination of fun

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:40.050
and the challenge, so not
solving trivial things

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:43.320
just because it's fun, but
a combination of the two,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.975
seeing something as
an unsolved problem.

00:38:45.975 --> 00:38:47.850
STEFANIE TELLEX: So I
try really hard to only

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:49.560
work on things that
are fun and to spend

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.909
as little time as possible
on things that are not fun.

00:38:51.909 --> 00:38:53.700
And I don't think of
it as a shallow thing.

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.991
I think of it as a kind of
resource optimization thing,

00:38:55.991 --> 00:38:58.140
because I'm about 1,000
times more productive when

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.780
I'm having fun than
when I'm not having fun.

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:04.320
So even if it was more
serious or something,

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.260
I would get so much less done
that it's just not worth it.

00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:11.430
It's better to do the fun
thing and work the long hours

00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:13.170
because it's fun.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.590
So for me it's just-- it's
still obviously the right thing

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:20.530
because so much more gets
done that way, for me.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:23.430
PATRICK WINSTON: Well, to
put another twist on this,

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:27.090
if you were a DARPA
program manager,

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:35.270
what would you do for the next
round of progress in robotics?

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:37.490
Do have a sense of
what ought to be next?

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:40.910
Or maybe what the flaws in
previous programs have been?

00:39:44.786 --> 00:39:47.160
STEFANIE TELLEX: So we've been
talking to a DARPA program

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.140
manager about what
they should do next.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.420
And we got a seedling
for a program

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:54.900
to think about planning in
really large state action

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.242
spaces to enable--

00:39:58.242 --> 00:39:59.700
the sort of middle
part of my talk,

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.616
we were talking about
the dime problem, right?

00:40:01.616 --> 00:40:04.830
So we wanted a planner
that could find actions

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:09.090
like picking up a like
small scale actions,

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:11.460
but also large scale things
like unload the truck

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.270
or clean up the warehouse.

00:40:13.270 --> 00:40:14.220
And so we were--

00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:15.780
because we thought
that is what's

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:17.730
needed to interpret
natural language commands

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.870
and interact with a person
at the level of abstraction.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:23.560
So we have a seedling
to work on that.

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:25.770
JOHN LEONARD: So if
I could clone myself,

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:27.600
say I made four or
five of my selves.

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.660
One of them I would, if I
were DARPA program manager,

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.740
to do Google for
the physical world.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:35.190
So think about having like
an object-based understanding

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:39.060
of things and people in
the environment and places,

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:43.080
and being able to do the
equivalent of internet search,

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:46.440
physical world search,
just combining perception

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.280
and then being able
to go get objects.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.510
So the physical-- like, w
get for the physical world.

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:56.350
That's what I would like to do.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.110
TONY PRESCOTT: In
the UK, I think--

00:40:58.110 --> 00:40:59.820
so I don't know about DARPA.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.380
But the government made
it one of their eight

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.230
great technologies
a few years ago,

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:06.470
robotics and autonomous systems.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:09.845
And looking again, now, at
the priorities and they're now

00:41:09.845 --> 00:41:11.970
looking, well, what are
the disruptive technologies

00:41:11.970 --> 00:41:15.720
in robotics, again, is coming
out as one of the things

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.230
that they think is important.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:21.160
So in terms of potential
economic and societal impact,

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:22.590
I think it's huge.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.500
And so if US funding
agencies aren't doing it--

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.640
PATRICK WINSTON: What do you
see those applications as being?

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.110
TONY PRESCOTT: I think--

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:35.500
well, the big one that interests
me is assistive technology.

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.620
In Europe, Japan,
I think the US,

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.140
we're faced with
aging society issues.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:43.752
And I think assistive
robotics in all sorts of ways

00:41:43.752 --> 00:41:44.460
are going to be--

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:46.830
PATRICK WINSTON: So you
mean for home health care

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:48.030
type of applications?

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:50.010
TONY PRESCOTT:
Home health care--

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.880
prosthetics is already
a massive growth area.

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:57.310
But robots-- I
mean, my generation,

00:41:57.310 --> 00:42:01.800
I've looked at the statistics
and the number of people that

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.640
are going to be in
the age group 80 plus

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:10.410
is going to be 50% higher
when I reach that age.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:14.320
And it's a huge burden on
younger people to care for us.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.420
So I think independence in my
own age, I think in my old age

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.122
I would love to be
supported by technology.

00:42:21.122 --> 00:42:22.830
You can do what you
like with a computer,

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:24.905
but you can't physically
help somebody.

00:42:24.905 --> 00:42:27.080
And that's where
robots are different.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.880
So that would be one of
the things that excites me,

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.690
and one of the reasons I'm
interested in applications.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:35.940
I'm driven, I think, by the
excitement of the research

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:37.160
and building stuff.

00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:40.260
But I'm also motivated
by the potential benefits

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.077
of the applications we can make.

00:42:42.077 --> 00:42:44.160
PATRICK WINSTON: I suppose
if they're good enough,

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.900
we won't need
dishwashers because they

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.221
can do the dishes themselves.

00:42:48.221 --> 00:42:48.720
OK.

00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:51.640
So now we have a question
from the audience,

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:54.570
which if I may paraphrase,
there have been a--

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:00.060
have there been examples--

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.190
I know you think of
them all the time, Tony.

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:03.810
But have there
been examples where

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.260
work on robotics in your
respective activities

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:11.340
have shed new light on
a biological problem

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.290
or inspired a
biological inquiry that

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:16.680
wouldn't have happened without
the kind of stuff you do?

00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:19.229
RUSS TEDRAKE: I started off
more as a biologist, I guess.

00:43:19.229 --> 00:43:20.770
I was in a computational
neuroscience

00:43:20.770 --> 00:43:22.260
lab with Sebastian Seung.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.700
I tried to study a lot
about how the brain works,

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.270
how the motor system
works, in the hopes

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.310
that it would help me
make better robots.

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.935
PATRICK WINSTON: Oh,
maybe pause there.

00:43:30.935 --> 00:43:31.620
Did it?

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.150
RUSS TEDRAKE: Yeah, it didn't.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.460
So I don't use that
stuff right now.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.360
I mean, maybe one day again.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.930
But our hardware
is very different,

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:44.694
our computational hardware
is very different right now.

00:43:44.694 --> 00:43:47.110
I think there's sort of a race
to understand intelligence,

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:49.170
and maybe we'll converge
again right now.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:52.650
But the things I write
down for the robots today

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:56.270
don't look anything like
what I think the brain--

00:43:56.270 --> 00:44:01.640
what I was learning about
what the brain did back then.

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:05.250
But that doesn't mean there's
not tons of cross-pollination.

00:44:05.250 --> 00:44:10.250
So we have a great project with
a biologist at Harvard, Andy

00:44:10.250 --> 00:44:12.290
Biewener.

00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:15.800
Andy has been studying
maneuvering flight in birds.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.110
He's instrumenting birds
flying through dense obstacles.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.690
We're trying to make UAVs
fly through dense obstacles.

00:44:21.690 --> 00:44:24.649
We're exchanging
capabilities and ideas

00:44:24.649 --> 00:44:25.690
and going back and forth.

00:44:25.690 --> 00:44:27.630
Just the algorithms
that we have written

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:30.610
helps him understand what
birds are doing and vice versa.

00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:32.560
So there's tons of exchanges.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.340
But the code that I write to
power of the robots today,

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.800
I think, is not quite
what the brain is doing,

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:41.100
and nor should it be.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.110
PATRICK WINSTON: Any
other thoughts on that?

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:47.350
GIORGIO METTA: Well,
we have experiments

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.560
that I meant to
actually present today,

00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:56.620
where we've been working with
neuroscientists on trying

00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:01.770
to bring some of the principles
from neuroscience to the robot

00:45:01.770 --> 00:45:02.640
construction.

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.700
Let's say, not the physical
robot, but the software.

00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:15.260
And I find always difficult to
find the level of abstraction

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:19.550
that actually motivate
something from neuroscience

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.980
and manages to show something
important for computation.

00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:29.670
I think I only have one
example, or two maybe overall.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:35.520
And it always happen not copying
in details brain structure,

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.120
but just taking an
idea what information

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:40.550
may be relevant
for a certain task

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:42.290
and trying to
figure out solutions

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:44.690
that use that information.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:48.880
In particular, a couple
of things we've done

00:45:48.880 --> 00:45:55.010
had to do with the involvement
of motor controlling

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:57.140
information in perception.

00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.570
And that's something
the sort of paid off,

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:04.280
at least in the
smallest experiments.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.540
Still, we can't compare
with full-blown systems.

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:11.320
Like we've done experiments
in speech perception

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.470
and that show to be
over-performing systems

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:17.510
that don't use
motor information,

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:19.430
but on limited settings.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:22.490
We don't know if we build
the full speech recognition

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:25.880
system what happens, whether
we better or worse existing

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:30.200
commercial methods or
commercial systems.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:35.300
So it's still a long
way to actually show

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:41.580
that we managed to get
something from the biological

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.940
counter-part.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.220
Although maybe for
the neuroscientists

00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.510
this explains something.

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:51.760
Because where they didn't
have a specific theory,

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.290
at least we showed
the advantages

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:54.940
of that particular
solution, that it's

00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:58.780
being used by the brain.

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:00.570
TONY PRESCOTT: So
I think there's--

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:04.830
we tend to forget in our history
where our ideas came from.

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:08.460
So for instance,
reinforcement learning--

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.290
Demis Hassabis
explained last night

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:13.740
how he's using this
to play Atari computer

00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:16.530
games and these amazing
system he's developing.

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.560
If you go back in the history
of reinforcement learning,

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:23.400
the key idea there came
from two psychologists,

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.680
Rescorla Wagner
developing a theory

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.470
of classical conditioning.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:34.170
And then that got picked up in
machine learning in the 1980s,

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:40.120
and it got really developed
and hugely accelerated.

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.900
But then there was crossover
back into neuroscience

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:44.900
with dopamine theory and so on.

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:47.880
And ideas about hierarchical
reinforcement learning

00:47:47.880 --> 00:47:51.600
have been developed that
are partly brain inspired.

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.630
So I think it's--

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.370
there is crossover,
and sometimes we

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:58.764
may lose track of how
much crossover there is.

00:47:58.764 --> 00:48:01.180
PATRICK WINSTON: I have another
comment from the audience,

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.870
I see we are under some
pressure to not drone on

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:05.530
for the rest of the evening.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:10.170
So the comment is I think
relevant to the last topic I

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:13.980
wanted to bring up, which
is the question of ethics

00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:14.670
in all of this.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:19.260
And the comment is
why should we make

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.939
robots that are good
at operating, doing

00:48:20.939 --> 00:48:22.980
things in the household,
take care of the elderly

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.140
and so on, when the rest
of AI is going hell-bent

00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.570
to put a lot of people
out of work and people

00:48:28.570 --> 00:48:30.910
who could perhaps
use those jobs.

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:35.700
But in any event, there's
been a lot of concern,

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:39.420
perhaps spawned by some of
the films like Ex Machina

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.140
and so on, that
robots will take over.

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:44.820
And I don't think are going
to take over in that sense

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:45.380
very soon.

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:46.570
But do you see--

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:49.470
do you worry-- do you think
about any dangers of the kinds

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:51.210
of technology you're
working on in terms

00:48:51.210 --> 00:48:54.522
of economic dislocation
or battlefield robots

00:48:54.522 --> 00:48:55.980
or anything of that
sort that might

00:48:55.980 --> 00:48:59.807
come about as a
consequence of what you do?

00:48:59.807 --> 00:49:01.390
RUSS TEDRAKE: I think
it's inevitable.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.870
I think we shouldn't
fear it, but we

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:05.860
have to be conscious of it.

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.640
So I mean, would you
look back to the 1980s

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:12.300
and avoid the invent of
the personal computer

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.030
because it was going to change
the way people had to do work?

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:17.160
I mean, of course you wouldn't.

00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:19.934
But at the same time
that changed the way

00:49:19.934 --> 00:49:20.850
people had to do work.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:25.015
And it was painful for a big
portion of the population,

00:49:25.015 --> 00:49:26.640
but ultimately it
was good for society.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.990
I think robots will have
the same sort of effect.

00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:32.520
It's going to raise
the bar on what

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.800
people are capable of doing.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.540
It's going to raise the
bar on what people have

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.790
to be successful in their jobs.

00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:41.130
And it might be
painful, but I think

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:45.350
it's super important for
society to keep moving on it.

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:47.641
PATRICK WINSTON: Why, again,
is it super important?

00:49:47.641 --> 00:49:49.640
RUSS TEDRAKE: Because
it's going to advance what

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.890
we're capable of as a society.

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:54.352
It's going to make us
ultimately more productive.

00:49:54.352 --> 00:49:56.392
PATRICK WINSTON: Other thoughts?

00:49:56.392 --> 00:49:57.350
TONY PRESCOTT: I agree.

00:49:57.350 --> 00:50:00.560
I mean, I think the people that
are worrying about jobs being

00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.460
taken by robots
aren't the people that

00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.980
want to do those jobs.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:06.590
Because most of the
jobs are ones that it's

00:50:06.590 --> 00:50:08.780
very hard to get anyone to do.

00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:13.080
They're low paid,
they're unpleasant.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:17.870
And we're automating the
dull and dreary aspects

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:19.610
of human existence.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:21.800
And that gives the
opportunity for people

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:23.750
to have more fulfilling lives.

00:50:23.750 --> 00:50:26.570
Now, the problem
isn't that we're

00:50:26.570 --> 00:50:29.510
doing this great work to
get robots or machines

00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:30.940
to do these things for us.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:33.410
It's that, as a
society, we're not

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:36.230
thinking about how
we adjust to that,

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:39.160
how we make sure people
will have fulfilling lives

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.280
and will be supported materially
to enjoy that prosperity.

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.620
So I think it's
disruptive in many ways,

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:47.710
and it's going to be
disruptive politically.

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:49.460
And we're going
to have to adapt.

00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:52.940
Because if you're
not working, then you

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.030
have to be supported
to enjoy your life.

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:58.650
And maybe that means a change
in the political system.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:01.790
So those are questions
perhaps not for us.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:03.560
But I think we maybe--

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.960
as the technologists,
we have to be prepared

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.800
to admit that what we're working
on are really disrupted systems

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.780
and they are going to
have these large impacts.

00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.790
And people are
waking up to that.

00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:16.620
And if we wave our hands
and say, don't worry,

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:20.810
I think we're not going
to be taken seriously.

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.030
PATRICK WINSTON: Other thoughts?

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:26.420
JOHN LEONARD: I see how these
are really important questions.

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.070
And I see--

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:29.000
I have mixed emotions.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.680
I'm really torn.

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.360
I came from a family
that was affected

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:33.920
by unemployment in the 1970s.

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:39.140
So I feel like I'm very
sympathetic to the potential

00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:40.440
for losing jobs.

00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:43.580
At CSAIL we've had this
wonderful discussion

00:51:43.580 --> 00:51:46.100
with some economists at
MIT the last few years,

00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:53.780
Frank Levy, David Autor, and
Eric Brynjolfsson, Andy McAfee,

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.630
and I've learned
a lot from them.

00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:58.100
And I think that they
vary in their views.

00:51:58.100 --> 00:52:00.994
I think I am more along
the lines of someone

00:52:00.994 --> 00:52:02.660
like David Autor,
who's an economist who

00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.780
thinks that we
shouldn't fear too

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:07.320
rapid a replacement of robots.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.310
If you look at the data,
that the things that are--

00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:13.920
I would say the things that are
hard for robots are still hard.

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:17.030
But on the other hand,
I think, longer term, we

00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:19.370
do have to be mindful of
as a society, that like,

00:52:19.370 --> 00:52:22.046
as Russ said, things like
this are going to happen.

00:52:22.046 --> 00:52:24.420
I think that the short term
introduction, if you look at,

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.060
for example, Kiva and how
they they've changed the way

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:27.920
a warehouse works.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.460
I think replacing humans
just completely with robots,

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.950
like, say, for gardening
or agriculture, some really

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:37.310
hard things to do, because
the problems are so hard.

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:41.000
But if you rethink the task to
have humans and robots working

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.940
together, Kiva's a good
example of how you actually

00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:44.976
can change things.

00:52:44.976 --> 00:52:46.850
And so that's where I
think the short term is

00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:49.490
going to come from, is humans
and robots working together.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:52.744
That's why I think HRI is
such an important topic.

00:52:52.744 --> 00:52:54.160
PATRICK WINSTON:
Well I don't know

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:57.560
if you running for president,
but be that is it may,

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.740
do any of you have
a one-minute closing

00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:02.412
statement you like to make?

00:53:02.412 --> 00:53:04.870
JOHN LEONARD: Well I'll go sort
of the deep learning thing.

00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:10.900
I think in robotics we have
this, potentially, a coming

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:12.760
divide between the
folks that believe more

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:16.070
in that data-driven learning
methods and more models.

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:19.580
And I'm a believer more
on the model-based side,

00:53:19.580 --> 00:53:21.895
that we don't have enough
data and enough systems.

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:29.530
But I do fear that we
could be in a society--

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:33.010
for certain classes of problems,
he or she who has the data

00:53:33.010 --> 00:53:35.830
may win, in terms of if
Google or Facebook have

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:38.740
just such massive amounts
of data for certain problems

00:53:38.740 --> 00:53:40.561
that academics can't compete.

00:53:40.561 --> 00:53:43.060
So I do feel there's a place
for the professor and the seven

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:45.340
grad students and a
couple of post-docs.

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:46.964
But if you do you
have to be careful

00:53:46.964 --> 00:53:48.880
in terms of problem
selection, that you're not

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.030
going right up against the sort
of one of these data machine

00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:52.655
companies.

00:53:52.655 --> 00:53:54.280
RUSS TEDRAKE: I was
going to say that I

00:53:54.280 --> 00:53:56.030
was looking at humans
right now and trying

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:59.050
to inform the robots,
I wouldn't look

00:53:59.050 --> 00:54:01.577
at center-out reaching
movements or nominal walking

00:54:01.577 --> 00:54:02.410
or things like this.

00:54:02.410 --> 00:54:04.120
I'd be pushing for
the corner cases.

00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.460
I've been trying to
really understand

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.920
the performance of
biological intelligence

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:13.720
in the screw cases, in the
cases where they didn't

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.250
have a lot of prior data.

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:18.070
They were once in a
lifetime experiences.

00:54:18.070 --> 00:54:20.980
How did natural
intelligence respond?

00:54:20.980 --> 00:54:23.740
That's, I think,
a grand challenge

00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:26.840
for us on the computational
intelligence side.

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.964
And maybe there's
a lot to learn.

00:54:29.964 --> 00:54:31.630
PATRICK WINSTON: And
the grand challenge

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:33.820
for me, to conclude
all this, has

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:38.230
to do with what it would really
take to make a robot humanoid.

00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:41.050
And I've been thinking
a lot about that

00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:44.050
recently in connection
with self-awareness,

00:54:44.050 --> 00:54:47.290
understanding the story,
having the robot understand

00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:50.080
the story of what's going
on throughout the day,

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:53.530
having it able to use
previous experiences to guide

00:54:53.530 --> 00:54:55.880
its future
experiences, and so on.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:58.090
So there's a lot to be
done, that's for sure.

00:54:58.090 --> 00:55:01.064
And I'm sure we'll be working
together as time goes on.

00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:02.730
Now I'd just like to
thank the panelists

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:05.480
and conclude the evening.

00:00:30.732 --> 00:00:31.565
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.800
Today we're going to continue
the topic of Consumption

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.850
Smoothing.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.900
This sort of sequence began
with the optimal allocation

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.070
of risk bearing and what
you would see in the data.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.440
We saw the benchmark was doing
well in many but not all cases.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.780
And there were some examples
where coefficients on income

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.550
were higher and for
certain occupations

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.725
and certain types of income.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.710
Then we took that same
benchmark still clinging to it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.273
and looked at a whole different
kind of data, production data.

00:01:17.273 --> 00:01:18.690
And we're going
to come back to it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.290
next time when we talk
about labor supply.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.080
But while we're on the subject
of consumption and consumption

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.110
smoothing, I thought
it would be good to go

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.030
through some
alternative models that

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.680
are widely used and
different data sets

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.910
and give you a sense of what
people do in the literature.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.400
So a lot of this has to do with
the permanent income model.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.580
It's just kind of the
basic sort of thing

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.210
that people rely on and
fall back on constantly

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.655
or say consumption smoothing
over the life cycle.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.880
These markets are not complete.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.680
They shut down a lot of the
risk contingencies allowing

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.610
households to trade only in risk
free bonds or maybe have some

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.240
other savings account which
cannot go below zero or limited

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.970
credit.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.740
The papers were going
to cover, first one,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.550
there's one by
Kaplan and Violante,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.250
which is going to look at
the degree of consumption

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.780
through smoothing from this SIM,
which is Standard Incomplete

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.730
Market model.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.150
They're also going
to simulate it.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:43.000
So that's using it
two purposes there.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.990
And we're going to
look at smoothing

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.990
through the lens of that
model and in the data

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.980
against permanent shocks
and transitory shocks.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.610
This is a language we have
not been using so far.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.650
But it is standard language
in this other literature,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.250
and look at how smoothing varies
against these various shocks

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.400
[? varies ?] over
the life cycle.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.740
The Violante paper
and others draw

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.470
on this [? Blundell, ?]
Pistaferri,

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.340
and Preston method,
which is looking

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.835
at consumption and income data.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.080
And in fact, there is not
typically a very long time

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.930
series in the US to use.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.770
The best is a PSID , which
used to only have food.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.950
So part of this paper is
about how to splice together

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:46.170
two different databases
to create a longer panel

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.270
and measure the degree
of smoothing in the data.

00:03:49.335 --> 00:03:52.500
Then we'll move to
Deaton and Paxson, which

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.340
is the same overall
topic but actually

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:57.780
quite interesting
because they're

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.450
going to be looking more at
the variance of consumption

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.740
in cross sections, which is
an implication of the models.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.410
But you don't need these panel.

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.100
You just need a bunch of cross
sections for various years.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.510
So effectively, if
it's representative,

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.110
you can track people by age.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.090
And again, they do that
through a permanent income

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.600
model, a buffer stock model,
a model with borrowing

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.070
constraints, as well as in the
background, the full insurance

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.870
model, and relate it
to things in the data.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.160
Then there's this Campbell
and Deaton paper, which

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.330
is about excess smoothness.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.580
And I kind of smile every
time I see this title because

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.290
from the standpoint of the
permanent income model,

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.305
you should respond to
shocks to permanent income.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.800
And they see in the
data that consumption

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.190
is smoother than that.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.550
So they call it
excess smoothness.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.800
My smiles come from
the fact that they

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.850
haven't considered the full
risk-sharing benchmark, which

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.190
may not fit
perfectly well either

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.910
but may be part of the
explanation in the background.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.430
And then finally, we have
this Krueger and Perri

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:33.990
paper, which looks at
the US and Italian data.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.720
And I hope we get time to say
a few words about this today

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.660
because

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.635
AUDIENCE: I'm doing
it in the recitation.

00:05:41.635 --> 00:05:43.760
ROBERT TOWNSEND: You're
doing it in the recitation?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.260
OK.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.430
Yeah, I originally had this as
part of the primary lecture,

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.320
and then we thought
there wasn't enough time

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.970
in class, which may yet
turn out to be true.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.500
And then I looked at it
again, and I really like it.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.295
So I'm glad one way or the
other, you're going to see it.

00:06:05.295 --> 00:06:07.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I'll do something else.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.820
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's fine.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:11.716
Maybe we'll get a
lot of questions.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:23.200
So what's the problem?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.950
In the US as I was saying,
we need longitudinal data

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.900
on consumption and income.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.660
And on consumption, we need
a comprehensive measure.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.410
No one's been gathering
these kinds of data.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.950
So how do people cope with it?

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.725
They could use the PS
and just look at food.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.070
Or they could look exclusively
at the Consumer Expenditure

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:55.090
Survey, which has a whole
bunch of line items.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.647
But people are not in that
sample for more than three

00:06:58.647 --> 00:06:59.355
or four quarters.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.960
Or you could sort of basically
create these synthetic cohorts

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.415
by sort of extrapolating
and merging,

00:07:13.415 --> 00:07:15.915
which is increasingly a common
way to deal with the problem.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.430
Another way to sort of
think about this upfront

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:33.250
is these models are
making a distinction

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.270
between permanent and transitory
shocks, but we only see income.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.810
We don't see each of these
different kinds of shocks

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:42.590
individually.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.608
So what to do about that?

00:07:45.608 --> 00:07:47.650
You could ignore it and
just look at the response

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.540
to total income
change, which is kind

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:52.380
of what we've been doing,
actually, in the development

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:52.965
data sets.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:59.280
You could use
proxies for permanent

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.660
versus transitory shocks.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.970
For example, disability
might rightly

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:06.150
be thought of as a
rather permanent shock.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.070
Short-term unemployment
might be thought

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.380
of as a transitory shock.

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:16.230
So that's another way to
try to deal with a problem.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.450
And then there's sort of a
public finance tax literature.

00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:22.610
Different people
assume different things

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:24.170
about different kinds of taxes.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.150
Some tax is assumed
to be permanent,

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.850
others assumed to be transitory.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.550
And then you kind of see how
households react to that.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:45.640
So the benchmark model
people use for saying,

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.570
quote, "How much insurance is
there actually in the data?"

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.820
Is this Blundell,
Pistaferri, Preston paper,

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:56.650
I doubt if we'll
get to that today.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.080
It is in the
appendix, so I have it

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.980
in the slides, time permitting.

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:07.450
But it's basically covariance
decomposition of the income

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.580
and consumption process.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.750
So that's the quote
view of the data.

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.300
Then for the models, you start
with the standard incomplete

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:20.710
markets model, assuming no
access to contingent claims

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.310
but allowing some
kind of insurance

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.600
through buying
and selling bonds.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:31.300
Now let me pause for a second,
just in case it's not clear.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:35.350
And this literature uses
confusing language, actually.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:39.400
If you thought about a household
in isolation or a business,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.720
they have ups and
downs of income.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.850
And it's clear that by
saving, you kind of smooth off

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:49.210
the peaks so that
higher income does not

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:51.220
make its way into consumption.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:55.480
And likewise, in the valleys,
when income is really low,

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.180
you can carry forward
that savings to that

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.050
spot or borrow, which
makes the valley less deep.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.940
So consumption is smooth
to a large degree,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:10.360
but not completely against
these fluctuations.

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.890
What's the difference
between that

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.830
and the full risk-sharing model?

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:17.590
The idea there is that you
don't have-- not everyone's

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.430
facing idiosyncratic
and transitory shocks

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:23.180
at the same time.

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.560
So as in the Rocky
Mountains diagram,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.560
peaks and valleys come
at different stages.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.570
And even after you act as if a
household would do everything

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:37.750
that it could on its
own, you're still

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.550
left with this
asynchronous timing.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.060
So what the risk-sharing
model is basically doing

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.260
is transferring consumption
around in the cross-section

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.388
to get even flatter consumption.

00:10:50.388 --> 00:10:52.180
And the only thing that
would be left then,

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.130
if you believe the full
risk-sharing model,

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:57.220
are those shocks that
basically somehow get

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.610
left in aggregate consumption
after all that smoothing.

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.630
The only part of the
peaks and valleys

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.070
that's common across all the
households would be left.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.050
And everything else
would be flattened out.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.880
So this literature,
it's true that you

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.070
can do an enormous
amount of smoothing

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.630
by borrowing and lending.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.600
But it is not true
that you can do

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:23.230
everything that would
be possible with greater

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.870
amounts of insurance.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.510
Anyway, so they start
with the standard--

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.150
note the word
standard-- it's standard

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:35.140
for the certain branches
of the macro literature,

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.770
incomplete markets literature.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.140
You may or may not
put on a lifecycle.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.800
To be realistic, you'd
say, the household faith

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.440
sees a stochastic
probability of dying.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:53.687
And that makes them
more and more vulnerable

00:11:53.687 --> 00:11:56.020
as they get older and older,
in some sense, because they

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.090
can't smooth that out.

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.900
Or they have to front-load
stuff into savings

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.750
to be able to cope with
fluctuations as they get older.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.815
So it does matter whether the
horizon is infinite or finite.

00:12:12.102 --> 00:12:13.810
There are permanent
and transitory shocks

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.490
to earnings while they earn.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.470
But if it's the life
cycle model as in the US,

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.370
where there is
literally retirement,

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.830
then earnings go to zero.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.430
You may have some income
stream from social security,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.120
and these guys
will load that in.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.950
And you may have
some assets you've

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:38.530
put in a pension fund, which has
kind of an insurance component

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.010
to it, in the sense that
you're getting an income

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:48.250
stream from the pension but
averaging over the mortality

00:12:48.250 --> 00:12:49.790
risk in the population.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.170
So there's a bit of insurance
in the standard pension funds.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:13:00.510
Another version has
borrowing limits.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.000
There's something called
the natural borrowing

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.500
limit or the zero.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.240
Zero is obvious.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.830
You can't borrow
anything at all,

00:13:07.830 --> 00:13:10.290
or you'll put just
a bound, can borrow

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.650
10% of your assets
or your income.

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:17.490
The natural borrowing limit
is something like this.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.200
You always have to
repay your debt.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.910
So you can't borrow
more than what

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.180
you could repay in the
worst possible income

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:26.790
realization in the future.

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.580
And then it matters a
lot what you're assuming

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:31.140
about the income process.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:34.320
If there's a small
chance of a zero income,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.720
and your debt is due
in that situation,

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.820
then effectively you
can't borrow at all.

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:42.870
So it's a rather
stringent criterion.

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.770
And then they'll take--

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:54.500
you'll see Kaplan and
Violante then take the model.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:59.130
And they simulate, hence
the SIM, artificial data

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.245
from the model itself.

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:05.990
There's two reasons
for doing that.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:11.050
First of all, this Blundell,
Pistaferri, Preston paper

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.700
is doing something
with the data.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.670
It's not a direct
look at the data.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:19.100
But the summary statistics
come from this BPP algorithm.

00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:20.590
So they want us--

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.230
if you want a common ground,
which is what's in the data

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:27.010
through BPP, then let's look at
the data generated by the model

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.040
through BPP and compare
apples to apples.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:38.380
On the other hand, when you have
a model and you simulated it,

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:39.640
that is the reality.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.540
You know exactly what
the economy is like.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.270
So they also use this--

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.720
pick up distortions,
where BPP is

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.050
kind of giving you a summary
statistic of the degree

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:55.480
of insurance, which is
not actually what's going

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.460
on in the underlying model.

00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.640
So they use this to
look at the biases

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.030
or what can generate the bias.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.580
The intuition there is
pretty straightforward.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:12.460
Zero borrowing or limits to
borrowing are like a corner.

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:14.830
And you're either constrained
or you're not constrained,

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:19.270
so that's a non-linearity,
whereas BPP algorithm

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:22.510
is basically linear.

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:28.000
So the distortions get
introduced by the more likely

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.780
you are to be hitting corners,
the higher the distortion is.

00:15:36.390 --> 00:15:41.630
So the standard
incomplete market model

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.490
generates an
insurance coefficient

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:50.590
for transitory shocks of
94% in the natural borrowing

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:54.430
constraint economy, or 82% in
the zero borrowing constraint

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:56.200
economy.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.190
That's a coefficient
for insurance,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:00.713
so that's a good thing.

00:16:00.713 --> 00:16:02.380
Be careful you don't
get flipped around,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.340
because we've been looking at
the degree to which consumption

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.170
fluctuates with income, so you
start to think high numbers

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.670
are bad.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:12.510
But this is 1 minus that.

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:15.610
So for them, high
numbers means insurance,

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.500
which means a good thing.

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.590
Those are numbers,
94, 82, compared

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:24.850
to the BPP run on the
actual data, which is 95.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:28.580
So that's an excellent fit.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.880
But when they look at
the insurance coefficient

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.170
for permanent shocks,
it's 22% or 7%,

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:38.800
depending in the model what
you assume about credit.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.790
But in the actual
data, it's 36%.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:46.390
And here already you're
seeing this recurrent theme

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.000
that there's better
smoothing against even

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.150
the permanent shocks in the
data than these models allow.

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.840
And then if you looked
at the life cycle

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.450
through the lens
of the model, you

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:05.770
would see better insurance
as people get older.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.290
But in the data, it's not there.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:10.450
There's no age
profile in the data.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.099
So the model-- another
way to say this,

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.839
is generating too
much consumption

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:20.530
smoothing for the older
workers, relative to the data,

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.290
or too little
smoothing for workers

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:26.470
in the early stage
of their lifecycle,

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:28.600
relative to the data.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:31.720
If you're skeptical, you've
got to be skeptical about BPP

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:33.460
because it's supposed
to be, quote,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:37.180
a "fact" that they're finding.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:41.380
We'll look at some of that
data though through the lens

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.060
of the cross-sectional
distributions

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:44.680
when we get to
Deaton and Paxson.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.980
And then you'll kind
of see something else.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:52.510
And I haven't thought about
how to reconcile that yet.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:57.580
So what I said about the
reliability, when they simulate

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:59.680
and use the data
from the model, it's

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:03.850
fine for the transitory
shocks, largely.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.430
But it tends to underestimate
the true coefficient

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.550
for the permanent shocks.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.490
That's actually making
this situation worse

00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:14.980
because then the
BPP measure, which

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.930
shows good insurance for
the permanent shocks,

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:21.550
is a lower bound estimate of the
actual insurance in the data,

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:23.310
so there's an even
greater divergence.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.837
Yes?

00:18:23.837 --> 00:18:25.670
AUDIENCE: Can I just
make sure I understood?

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.520
So in the data, we
see changes in how

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.275
I smoothed over the lifecycle.

00:18:31.275 --> 00:18:33.810
But in the model, we
don't see any changes?

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.280
Or have I got it
wrong way around?

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.530
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No, it's
almost the other way around.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:38.420
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.850
So the model we see it as
[? profile, ?] but in real life

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:41.450
we don't see--

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.543
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:18:43.543 --> 00:18:45.960
AUDIENCE: So that seems kind
of counterintuitive, I guess,

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.640
to us.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.063
Wouldn't we expect-- maybe I'm
thinking of a different method.

00:18:51.063 --> 00:18:52.980
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
the problem is taking--

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.810
the model is
generating differences

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.610
by age because of
the life cycle.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:06.720
But the data does not show that.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:12.540
So that's why you get this
sort of odd-looking statement

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:15.600
that looks like it's more
criticism of the model.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.710
But it's of the model
relative to the flat data.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:21.030
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
once we [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.680
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Someone once said,

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.960
if the data don't
fit the model, it

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.550
must be something
wrong with the data.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:32.190
So we're feeling
at pressure here.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.090
I didn't say that.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:47.200
How can you get more
smoothing to generate

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:55.395
less sensitivity of consumption
to these permanent shocks?

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.310
Because again, there's-- it
seemed to get turned around

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:04.420
so easily.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.310
There's more smoothing in
the data than in the models.

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.480
So you want the model to allow
more smoothing to catch up

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.020
to the data.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.640
And one thing you could
do is give households

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.710
a little more information
about the future.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:19.720
And then the idea--

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.830
it's a smoothing model.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.680
So if they know things are
going to get better or worse,

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.790
they can take actions now
and adjust consumption.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.430
So the overall profile
that would result

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:34.630
would be smoother if they
could anticipate future income,

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:42.610
rather than having to react
to sudden information.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:46.930
And a close cousin of
that is to move away

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:54.010
from some random walk, to put in
some serially correlated income

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.690
process.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.660
And that, actually,
does a better job

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.300
in getting the model
to match the data.

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:12.010
As I said, so far in this class,
we haven't talked too, too much

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:15.890
about these income processes.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:20.030
But it's really front
and center here.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:23.760
What you assume about an
income process, is it IID?

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.780
Is it autoregressive,
for that matter,

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.980
with high frequency data?

00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.590
What about the seasonality
and everything?

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:37.920
That makes you aware of
both the great strength

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.770
and vulnerability of the
risk-sharing model, which

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:45.270
says it doesn't matter what
time it is or what state it is.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.960
Just add up total consumption
and smooth it out.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.040
There's a fixed static
rule for allocating risk.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:56.550
There could be predictable
periodic seasonal fluctuations

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.530
or trends in income.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.780
It doesn't matter for
the risk-sharing model.

00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:07.454
But here with incomplete
models, it matters much more.

00:22:07.454 --> 00:22:09.835
AUDIENCE: You say that
two is better than one.

00:22:09.835 --> 00:22:11.715
If it's AR, it's
going to be better

00:22:11.715 --> 00:22:13.560
than predicting the future.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.012
But AR, to a degree, is also the
ability to predict the future.

00:22:19.012 --> 00:22:20.720
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
it's very related.

00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.090
AUDIENCE: So there's
something else from the AR

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.585
that's making it better?

00:22:24.585 --> 00:22:26.460
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I guess
there are other ways

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.990
to predict the future.

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:31.080
Even if the process itself
is not autoregressive,

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.850
you could get signals about what
it's going to be in the future.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.800
AUDIENCE: That's
not as good as--

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.800
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's
what the claim is, yeah.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.320
That's what they find.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.510
So here's the model, finally.

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:45.560
There is no aggregate
uncertainty.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:53.610
Agents work until retirement,
but they don't die then.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.670
There's a probability
[? z ?] of surviving.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:03.530
This is, I guess, retirement
is a really bad thing

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:07.000
because if you
don't retire, you're

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
going to live with
probability 1.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.540
So anyway, this is
a simplification.

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:21.310
So they only start using these
actuarial tables after age

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.900
60 or 65, whatever they
put in for retirement age.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:29.110
So it's maximizing
discounted expected utility,

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.970
common utility function.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:33.950
We've been doing
a lot of that too.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.940
Beta is the standard discount
rate. [? Z ?] is this--

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.270
you only get the utility
if you're alive, basically.

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:44.330
So that's a standard adjustment
to the discount rate.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:49.860
The income process
is a bit complicated.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:55.560
First of all, there is a
possible nonstochastic trend,

00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:59.240
sort of the deterministic
part, which could move income

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:04.170
along with T. And then you
have income, quote, "standard."

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:05.690
Here's the decomposition.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.800
Income is equal to z, which
is this permanent thing,

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.470
in this case, entirely a
random walk, and epsilon,

00:24:13.470 --> 00:24:18.170
which is the IID
transitory shock.

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:21.410
So these papers use
different notation.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.530
And this paper, z, is permanent,
and epsilon is transitory.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.110
And eta is another shock.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:29.930
And that's the shock to
permanent income, basically.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:38.320
So in expectation, you expect
your income to be what it was.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.240
You expect the permanent
part of your income

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.790
to be exactly what
it was last period.

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:48.600
But this thing will
move that around.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.820
And then these have variances--

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:54.140
sigma eta, sigma epsilon.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:59.670
The budget constraint, again,
is like this bond, which you may

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:02.190
or may not be able to short.

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:07.730
So you've got your
assets from last period.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.240
That's earning interest,
plus your income.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.510
So this is like your
disposable income,

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:18.100
which you can spend on
consumption and assets,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.290
going forward.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.280
Watch the subscript.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.330
It'll drive you crazy.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.220
It does me.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.360
This is dated t plus 1.

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:31.210
But it's decided on a t,
and consumption is also

00:25:31.210 --> 00:25:32.770
decided on a t.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.270
So in some of these
formulas, you're

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.330
going to see a mysterious
interest rate adjustment.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:43.630
And it has to do with this sort
of convention of the timing.

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:46.840
This looks the same,
except as I said,

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:50.120
it's like a pension
fund in your assets.

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.495
So effectively,
this gets adjusted.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:59.590
It's not like everyone has
their own individual retirement

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:02.410
account, which you draw down.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.600
There's a pool of money there.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.330
Some people continue to
live, and some don't.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:12.280
And so those-- in other words,
if you're, quote, "lucky,"

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.080
and you keep living,
you could actually

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.730
draw more from the fund
than what you put in there.

00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:21.895
And this is a very convenient
way to kind of adjust.

00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:30.510
Oh, and if you're retired
you get your social security

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.940
benefits.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.400
They're going to put
some numbers in here

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.480
from the life cycle
literature and other sources,

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.480
using various US data sets.

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.490
And I'm not going to
dwell on the numbers.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:51.050
But this is a classic
picture of the life cycle.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:56.940
So here are the
earnings going up.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.370
You guys are down here
somewhere, on average.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.780
You can expect to do
better eventually.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.800
And then you get to be 60,
and it doesn't go to zero.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.490
That's if you were a US citizen,
that's where you start drawing.

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.070
Actually, you could
just be an immigrant.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:22.080
You start drawing social
security benefits.

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:29.310
With this profile, you try
to keep consumption steady.

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.690
It's not completely flat.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:32.760
It just looks flat
relative to everything else

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:33.570
on this diagram.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:36.810
It's actually
increasing somewhat.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:41.082
But the goal of the
life cycle smoothing

00:27:41.082 --> 00:27:44.340
is to try to have more or
less steady consumption.

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:51.270
Again, this is-- there
are two lines here.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:53.995
There's a natural borrowing
constraint and zero borrowing

00:27:53.995 --> 00:27:54.495
constraint.

00:27:54.495 --> 00:27:57.270
It doesn't make too much
different for consumption.

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.080
I guess here the zero
borrowing constraint

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.790
looks more constraining.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:09.510
So when you're young,
expecting on average higher

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:13.110
future income, you might
want to borrow against that

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.240
and repay the debt later.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.760
But you hit one or the
other of these constraints,

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.710
so you can't do that too much.

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:28.030
Of course, the gorilla in the
room is this wealth profile.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.320
And that's where all the
action is, basically.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:35.910
In fact, you're basically
over the life cycle,

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:40.608
accumulating and then
deaccumulating wealth.

00:28:40.608 --> 00:28:43.085
That's what's keeping
consumption steady.

00:28:43.085 --> 00:28:45.660
And remember, when income
goes to virtually zero,

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.190
apart from social
security, you've

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:49.020
got to live off the
interest in your--

00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:56.700
you have social security, plus
the adjusted actuarial interest

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.840
off the pension fund.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.500
And that's typically
a lot smaller flow

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.230
than was your previous income.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.650
So you need a ton
of assets to be

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.770
able to survive into old age.

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:13.785
This is drawn out, looks
like to 90 something, 95.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.770
That could have
been shown first,

00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:28.250
but that's kind of a summary
of the life cycle model

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:31.940
and what Kaplan and
Violante are doing,

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:38.450
and they're generating these
smoothing statistics from date

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.010
by date with shocks.

00:29:40.010 --> 00:29:43.730
But this is the overall
pattern you would see.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:48.560
Let's go to Deaton and Paxson
for a very different look at it

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:53.580
through the lens of
these cross sections.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.450
The starting point, again, is
that with a permanent income

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.480
hypothesis, consumption
of each person

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:04.820
should basically
follow a random walk.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:09.650
Again, the idea is
you should basically

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.035
be eating at the level
of your permanent income.

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.880
And when you're permanent
income is shock,

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.290
then your consumption is shock.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.100
But the implication
that consumption

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:31.510
follows a random walk
means, basically, you'll

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.150
see the equations for it.

00:30:34.150 --> 00:30:37.330
Date by date by
date, you get hit

00:30:37.330 --> 00:30:41.110
with positive or negative
shocks and their IID.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:44.230
So basically, some
people have their ups

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.510
and other people
have their downs.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.290
So you start getting
this fanning out.

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:51.880
And then you go-- then you take
the cohort that is still all

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.690
alike.

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:54.220
Go one more period.

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.510
They have ups and downs.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.580
Those guys fan out a bit.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.520
So the cross-sectional
distribution

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.350
just keeps getting
fatter and fatter

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:04.300
with bigger and bigger tails.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:10.660
So all of the slides,
basically, are

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:15.190
going to be about this
increasing consumption

00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:17.065
inequality in the cross-section.

00:31:17.065 --> 00:31:20.560
They measure it by
the standard deviation

00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.610
of the log of consumption,
age group by age group.

00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:34.750
But again, if you thought
about full risk-sharing,

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.650
you get this dramatic contrast.

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:41.340
At least for the cases where
people have uniform risk

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.030
aversion and so on, then
we know that what pins down

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:47.880
the level of your
consumption, on average, is

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.710
going to be your Pareto weight.

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:53.310
And you kind of have
those fixed at t equals 0.

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:55.800
That's going to
fix the intercepts.

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.220
And your consumption might
fluctuate with aggregate shocks

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.680
around that, but it's
not going to move

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.060
with age or anything else.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:06.030
So basically, the
cross-sectional dispersion

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:10.930
of consumption does not increase
in the full risk-sharing model.

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:15.270
But you will see that in the
data, depending on the country,

00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:15.980
it does happen.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.930
You have to be a little
mindful of going back and forth

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:33.090
between this cross-sectional
age-dependent inequality,

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:38.470
and inequality for the
economy as a whole,

00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:40.810
because demographics can shift.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:44.650
Even if you give
me someone's age,

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:47.560
and I'll tell you sort of what
the cross-sectional dispersion

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:51.015
is in the population, when you
have demographics going on,

00:32:51.015 --> 00:32:52.390
you may have an
increasing number

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:57.380
of young people or old people,
depending on the economy.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.690
So you're basically taking
an age-weighted average

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:05.560
as the demographics shift, and
that will shift inequality.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.000
So an issue in
this literature is

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.950
how much of aggregate
inequality can

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:13.780
be explained by these kinds
of life cycle smoothing

00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:18.820
considerations, and
how much by baby booms

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.700
versus fertility
drops and all of that.

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:33.250
So this is kind of nice because
they have the US, Britain,

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:37.360
and cross sections, which
are three countries that

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:43.180
have a quite ample amount of
cross-sectional consumption,

00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:46.840
for that matter,
also, income data.

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:50.980
They're going to use 47
annual surveys spread out

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.350
over the three
countries and look

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:59.450
at the implications of
these models for the kind

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:02.000
of cross-sectional
inequality and see

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.580
what it takes to explain it.

00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:06.875
So how does this work exactly?

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.210
So we want to follow
cohorts over time.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:17.230
We cannot follow an
individual person over time,

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:20.230
because it's not panel data.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:24.920
But you make the assumption
that, for example,

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:33.179
if you see a bunch of
31-year-olds in 1976 in Taiwan,

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:35.310
you're getting a good
summary statistic

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.840
of the cross-sectional
dispersion

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:39.150
of their consumption in 1976.

00:34:39.150 --> 00:34:43.230
And then you go to 1977,
and they are now 32.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.060
Actually, "they"
isn't quite correct,

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.370
because it's a
different set of people.

00:34:47.370 --> 00:34:50.850
But again, you hope
you have enough of them

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:55.170
and that the basic
assumptions are correct,

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:59.230
that you can take these
kinds of statistics

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.230
as representative of
what you would have seen

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.180
if you could have
been able to continue

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:05.950
to track the same people.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:12.672
Some people actually think
this is better than panel data,

00:35:12.672 --> 00:35:14.380
in the sense that you
don't have to worry

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.600
about people dropping
out, and the data

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.280
becomes unrepresentative.

00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.897
And there is some truth to that.

00:35:21.897 --> 00:35:23.980
There are issues about
whether the data are coming

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:26.700
from households or individuals.

00:35:26.700 --> 00:35:29.590
You have to make
some adjustments

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:32.700
for household composition.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.220
And the surveys being used
here are the Personal Income

00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.610
Distribution Survey in Taiwan,
the Consumer Expenditure Survey

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.000
in the US-- that's the same
one we've referred to before--

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.080
and this Family Expenditure
Survey in Great Britain.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:51.960
So it takes a bit of
staring to get used to this.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:36:01.500
So we start out with people
who are age 15 in 1976.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:06.510
And they kind of start
here in calendar time, 1982

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.520
or something like that.

00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.600
Again, we don't track
the same people.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.450
But we can look what happens.

00:36:15.450 --> 00:36:18.210
This paper is not the most
recent thing in the world.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.560
It's just a really nice one.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:23.620
So they basically stopped
using data after 1990.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:28.680
So we go back to
the 1976 survey,

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.490
all the way up to the 1990
survey, with repeated cross

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:34.980
sections and looking what
happens to inequality

00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:39.700
in this cohort, as they age.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:41.325
These guys were 15.

00:36:41.325 --> 00:36:44.470
These guys were 20 in 1976.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:47.460
So they start older, and they're
going to end a bit older.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:56.800
And then you keep going here
to the aged 55 people in 1976

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.110
and so on.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.270
These are pretty flat,
then these profiles

00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:02.840
start to pick up.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.880
You kind of in your mind
sort of can imagine.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.890
And I'll show you
what happens when

00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.840
we splice all this together.

00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:18.140
AUDIENCE: It seems like
a lot of the action

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.320
is brought about by the--

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.930
towards those
middle-aged cohorts.

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:30.530
Those who start middle-aged did
in '76, like, from 40 to 55.

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.780
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Let me just--

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.250
AUDIENCE: The rest
is kind of flat.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:37.370
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Let me
just jump because I--

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.660
those are the three countries.

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.280
Here's what's going to--

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:43.130
when you use all the
surveys over all the years

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.650
and just focus on the age--

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.690
yeah, so you see this.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:48.530
You're right.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:51.200
You see this is pretty
flat, and then it

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:57.233
picks up around age whatever,
45 or 50 or something.

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.142
And these are the results
from the other countries.

00:38:04.142 --> 00:38:06.890
AUDIENCE: So is
there any explanation

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.175
for why that's the case?

00:38:08.175 --> 00:38:10.947
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, we're
going to get into that.

00:38:10.947 --> 00:38:12.030
You'll be sorry you asked.

00:38:15.236 --> 00:38:16.565
AUDIENCE: And only in Taiwan.

00:38:16.565 --> 00:38:17.440
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Huh?

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.648
AUDIENCE: And only in Taiwan.

00:38:18.648 --> 00:38:20.040
The others seem to be--

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.730
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK, so
this is kind of flat,

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:27.150
and then it kind of comes up,
and then it flattens out again.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:33.210
So Taiwan is flattening out,
although, unfortunately,

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:35.790
the cohorts are getting
thin the older they are.

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:38.280
So you get some
sort of shaky data

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.950
because you can't
average quite so well.

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.840
This one flattens out.

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:45.720
Great Britain kind
of flattens out.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.580
The US, I don't
know, wasn't very

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.010
steeply climbing to begin with.

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:52.200
It's not so obvious.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.530
This kind of looks concave.

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:59.310
This looks concave
but almost linear.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:03.150
This actually has almost
an inflection point

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:05.680
and then comes in.

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:09.990
So the question is
concave, convex, et cetera,

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:13.870
and that's where we'll
do a little modeling.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.980
By the way, you saw a little
bit about demographics

00:39:21.980 --> 00:39:23.000
when we did China.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.710
One of those explanations
of the savings rates,

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:28.620
et cetera, wasn't so much
about state-owned enterprise

00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:34.580
as it was the different
demographics, and young savers

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:40.880
in China, and sort of
debt-loaded or less

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.353
saving-inclined households
in the US, and so different

00:39:43.353 --> 00:39:43.895
demographics.

00:39:43.895 --> 00:39:49.490
Just to remind you,
it's not the first time

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.510
that we've thought
about demographics.

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:55.380
So it's possible to put that--

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.700
there's trivial demographics
in some of the macro models,

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:01.490
in the sense that they
start with a lifecycle model

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:05.120
or two-period overlapping
generations model.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:09.680
But we haven't actually
focused on much

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:12.545
of this in the sort of
micro part of the class.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.800
So this is what I said in words.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.990
They claim Britain
is slightly convex.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:22.340
I didn't see that just now.

00:40:29.930 --> 00:40:33.380
And again, don't
misread those things

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.530
to be measures of
the total increases

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:38.450
or decreases in
inequality, because

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:43.340
the demographic structure
is moving around by age

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:46.340
over those 20 or so years.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.530
Let's start with the basics.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:58.330
Here is basically Hall's
permanent income implication

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:00.070
for consumption.

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:04.990
Consumption should
essentially be a random walk.

00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:06.640
And it's only moving
around because

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:11.830
of the innovations or the
shock to permanent income.

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:15.700
I think that was
[? JPE, ?] 1970.

00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.330
The dates here, I think
it was in the [? JPE. ?]

00:41:19.330 --> 00:41:20.320
There are assumptions.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:23.170
This isn't always true.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:29.110
He assumed quadratic utility,
additive preferences,

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:35.640
discount rates equal to
interest rates, and, I think,

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.100
another life cycle.

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:39.900
This is supposed to
be an innovation,

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:47.610
so for every person
at least, there's

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:50.760
no covariance between
lagged consumption

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.470
and this innovation,
because it wasn't

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.460
supposed to be predictable.

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:57.750
That's the same conversation,
just how much, if anything,

00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:59.360
you see about the future.

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:02.250
Here, zero is seen.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.130
So I described this in words.

00:42:05.130 --> 00:42:10.830
But basically, if it were
stable like this on average,

00:42:10.830 --> 00:42:15.670
then consumption dispersion
shouldn't be changing.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:18.670
But you're just
layering on repeatedly,

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.100
shock after shock after shock.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.800
So with that zero
covariance assumption,

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.270
the variances are increasing
by the variance of that [? u ?]

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:29.200
t shock.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:44.980
And basically, if you started
plotting these distributions,

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:47.230
the one at t is going
to have fatter tails

00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:49.660
than the one at t minus 1.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:53.950
So t minus 1, [? quotient, ?]
first order stochastically

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:54.730
dominates.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.000
You have to be a little
bit careful throughout all

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.920
of this stuff.

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.750
You think about
things in the point

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:09.780
of view of a person
tracking a person over time.

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.540
But that statement
about c t and [? u t ?]

00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:17.310
is actually a statement about
the cross section, as well as

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.240
the intertemporal dimension.

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:32.340
This model typically
didn't have taste shifters

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.310
or heterogeneous preferences.

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.440
You can put those things in.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:41.630
Depending on how you put them
in, it does make a difference.

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:45.010
Arguably, if we hadn't done
the demographics right,

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:46.590
but they claim--

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:50.060
Deaton and Paxson
claim for Taiwan,

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:54.530
then you kind of need
preference shocks to help

00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:56.090
with the observed dispersion.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.125
Here is the basic sort
of budget equation again.

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:16.460
And I'm afraid each
one of these papers

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.080
kind of has a different
convention about the timing.

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:23.610
So it's really kind of hard
to keep tracking and track it.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:31.170
But basically, you have
sources and uses of money.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:34.640
The sources are previous
assets plus interest.

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:37.560
The uses are-- source
also is income,

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:38.890
and the use is consumption.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:42.800
And then what you don't
spend accumulates on

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.000
to the next period.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.880
If you do do the life cycle
with a terminal date, for sure,

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:58.900
say, age 99 or
whatever you want,

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:03.190
then you can actually
get a formula closed form

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:07.400
for consumption, under these
other maintained assumptions.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.760
And basically, it's
kind of saying,

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:15.790
consumption ought to equal
something about the return

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.060
stream through the
interest rate on assets,

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:23.230
and something about the
forward-looking part, which is

00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:25.900
expected future income shocks.

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:33.640
So this kind of helps you see
how future things are already--

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.140
if this is going
to be very high,

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.800
for example, then this
is already going up.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.900
So it's kind of smooth against--

00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.750
or low, vise versa.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:46.510
It's tricky with a finite
horizon and a cap t

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:51.520
because there is a coefficient
premultiplying this,

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.410
but it's for that
reason, basically.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:59.320
Obviously, the closer you
are to the end to cap t,

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.090
the less smoothing
you can accomplish.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:04.480
And that's inherited
into this formula.

00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.490
Yep?

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:10.175
AUDIENCE: The shocks here
are IID all the time?

00:46:10.175 --> 00:46:11.050
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:19.455
Well, the shock to
permanent income is IID.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:25.240
But permanent income is
an autoregressive process.

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.695
The standard incomplete markets
model had an infinite horizon.

00:46:37.695 --> 00:46:39.900
And it had a discount
rate equal to 1,

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:46.025
or basically beta times
1 plus r equals 1.

00:46:46.025 --> 00:46:48.390
In the finite
horizon case, beta,

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:51.540
that thing premultiplying
consumption,

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:56.160
turns out if you stare
at it, is concave.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:00.610
We're already beginning to
anticipate these formulas

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:02.940
and decreasing in t.

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:05.310
And if you go back to
those two equations,

00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:08.050
you'll get kind of a
simplified version,

00:47:08.050 --> 00:47:11.190
that beta t times the
change in consumption

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:17.730
is equal to this, quote,
"consumption innovation."

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.410
And here's a formula for
the consumption innovation,

00:47:20.410 --> 00:47:27.620
which is, again, the
difference in expectation.

00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.650
So you're forecasting
the future all the time.

00:47:31.650 --> 00:47:34.480
But you're also
getting these shocks.

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:42.170
So as of t and t minus 1,
you were forecasting y t

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:43.400
at t plus k.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:48.710
Sorry, y of t plus k, not either
to either, to t or t minus 1.

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:50.360
It could be 10 years out.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.080
And you're constantly
adjusting your expectations,

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.940
based on the current
information you

00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:57.500
have from the income process.

00:47:57.500 --> 00:47:59.900
And you're summing up over
all those future income

00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:06.380
shocks and discounting
backwards to get

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.600
these, quote, "innovations."

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:16.700
So then imagine starting
this out at some date t

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:22.340
equals 0, and then t equals
1, and t equals 2, and so on.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:24.650
And you could just
write out, literally,

00:48:24.650 --> 00:48:26.300
consumption in each
one of those dates.

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:32.930
And of course, when you go
from one date to another,

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.730
you get hit with this shock.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.430
And you're premultiplying
by the beta,

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:42.140
so you end up with this,
an explicit formula

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:46.220
for consumption equal to
its initial given level.

00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.160
Plus, the beta moves
on the right-hand side,

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:51.410
this sort of beta discounted.

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:54.260
But it's not beta in
the preference function.

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:58.040
This is that beta thing that
had to do with little t,

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.350
big T, and all of
that, that took

00:49:00.350 --> 00:49:03.010
care of the lifecycle
considerations.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.910
So finally, we see
again the familiar theme

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:14.170
that the variance
at t is related

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:17.170
to the initial cross-sectional
variance at zero,

00:49:17.170 --> 00:49:21.250
plus the sum of variance terms.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:28.000
So the issue-- so
roughly speaking,

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.470
it looks like, yeah, it ought
to increase-- unless you retire

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.680
and you have no more
things then forecast,

00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.120
then this piece goes away.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.910
But before that happens,
you're looking at future

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:44.920
and making expectations
of future income.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:48.120
So you just keep adding on.

00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:51.000
So that's why inequality
is increasing in the data,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.010
through the lens
of these models.

00:49:53.010 --> 00:50:00.030
And then the issue is, is it
linear or concave or convex?

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:01.980
That has to do with
this beta and also

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:08.690
has to do with what we
can infer about sigma,

00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:10.550
about the consumption
innovations.

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:24.100
So in response to
your question, if we

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:27.130
assume this
innovation is entirely

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:32.050
white noise, normalized
by the interest rate,

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:35.560
then sigma square eta
at t is a constant

00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:37.000
that doesn't depend on t.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:41.470
And this is the
resulting expression

00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:43.700
with the sigma square
eta pulled out front.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:49.030
And then the
convexity is entirely

00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:52.720
due to this beta
thing, which if you

00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:57.130
start taking some derivatives
and so on, it's a bit messy.

00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:01.930
You can convince yourself
that that thing is convex.

00:51:01.930 --> 00:51:04.710
Here's an orthogonal example.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:06.460
I guess, [? Jan, ?] I
jumped the gun a bit

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:08.800
because this actually
allows something a bit

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:13.180
different, which is this
autoregressive thing.

00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:15.430
This is IID, and then
this is autoregressive,

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:20.260
so this income
process is persistent.

00:51:27.470 --> 00:51:31.760
It's a bit odd because this
was the innovation that had

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:38.210
to do with the innovation to--

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.970
the right-hand side had to
do with all those expectation

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:41.640
differences.

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.640
So it's like, let's just assume
it looks something like this.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.020
This is more explicit
about the income process.

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:50.750
And you can derive the
formula for the change

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:55.210
in consumption, where this
beta r thing is now this mess.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:05.330
And it turns out,
this will be concave

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:08.320
if you can sign this expression.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:11.480
And it may also be
decreasing in age

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:16.580
if this is true, and so
actually, except for some days

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:17.780
of theta, both things--

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.050
So two of those three
countries, the profile

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:28.450
was, say, not concave.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:31.750
It could have been linear, which
is a weak case of concavity,

00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:33.580
or even convex.

00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:37.240
And so basically, then
you could rule this out

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.770
because these are--

00:52:38.770 --> 00:52:41.110
this kind of persistence
would give you concavity.

00:52:41.110 --> 00:52:42.160
But you don't see that.

00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:49.870
But then we have
the sort of paradox

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:55.910
that something like these
white noise processes

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:57.680
must be closer to
the truth if we're

00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.660
going to get convex profiles.

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:05.090
But that's an assumption
about the income process.

00:53:05.090 --> 00:53:09.720
And in particular,
one way to get it

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:14.650
is to say that there's a large
stationary component to income.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:20.620
So you're not getting those
innovations in your forecasts.

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:24.460
And we don't see
that in the data.

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.200
Income profiles
are not stationary.

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:31.050
There's heavy
lifecycle components.

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:42.190
So nothing's perfect, I guess.

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:45.100
Every model is a benchmark.

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:46.810
Almost every model
is going to deliver

00:53:46.810 --> 00:53:48.430
something that might fit well.

00:53:48.430 --> 00:53:52.450
Otherwise, we're probably
not reading it in a journal.

00:53:52.450 --> 00:53:56.260
Or it may actually
also generate things

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:58.080
that are not consistent
with the data,

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:01.300
and if you're a good scholar,
you're reporting that too.

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:10.020
What about the permanent
income and the dispersion

00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:10.965
of income by age?

00:54:16.740 --> 00:54:20.090
So again, disposable
income takes

00:54:20.090 --> 00:54:28.300
on this form, which is
sort of asset return

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.520
stream, plus income.

00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.920
And then you use it for
consumption and savings,

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:36.430
adjusting for where you
are in the life cycle.

00:54:36.430 --> 00:54:37.990
Or you could take
the difference.

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:40.420
Savings is the
difference between income

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:44.140
and this beta-adjusted
consumption.

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:48.710
And some of these models
you can get a closed form

00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:53.210
expression for savings, namely
the so-called Campbell's "rainy

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:59.960
day," which is really
kind of cool, which is you

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:05.450
save enough at t to be able
to cover the discounted

00:55:05.450 --> 00:55:10.700
shortfalls in sort of
these earnings innovations.

00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:16.900
So you want to smooth those out.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:20.310
And you save just enough
to do that in expectation.

00:55:24.110 --> 00:55:30.010
Anyway, so we're rewriting
disposable income

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:31.750
equal to the savings component.

00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:37.410
We already had that,
less the savings--

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:39.120
plus the savings component.

00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.450
Sorry, I get confused
because savings was negative.

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:46.200
It used to be here,
and now it's out here.

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:49.170
Savings is not negative,
but these innovations

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:53.340
are negative because you
save to cover shortfalls.

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:55.170
And then you get
implications here

00:55:55.170 --> 00:56:00.528
for if one thing
is a random walk,

00:56:00.528 --> 00:56:02.070
and the other thing
is a random walk,

00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:04.070
then the sum of two things
that are random walks

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:05.430
is also a random walk.

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:16.410
So basically, savings ought to
be stationary in that sense.

00:56:16.410 --> 00:56:18.500
And it ought to be
dispersing at the rate

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:21.720
that consumption is dispersing.

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.900
And they don't see that
in the data either.

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:33.030
And in particular,
earnings is dispersing,

00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:37.680
which is a point that was made
on the other slide as well.

00:56:42.810 --> 00:56:45.890
And then finally,
I guess this is

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:49.550
like the fourth version
of something that starts

00:56:49.550 --> 00:56:51.110
to look like the same thing.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.470
Most of those
analytic expressions

00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:59.720
were assuming something
like quadratic utility.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:03.560
That's how you managed to get
this really tight reduced form

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.480
analytic expression.

00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.910
If you don't do that, if you
have constant relative risk

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:12.500
aversion, for example, or a
more general utility function,

00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:15.580
than the Euler
equation basically

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:23.150
is going to equate the marginal
utility today to something

00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:24.710
like marginal utility tomorrow.

00:57:32.546 --> 00:57:36.030
We might say, well, where's
the expectation operator?

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:39.190
Instead, the shock is put over
here on the right-hand side.

00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:42.300
So this is like
an Euler equation.

00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:45.670
If this were 0, and
the interest rate

00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:49.610
was equal to this
delta discount rate,

00:57:49.610 --> 00:57:53.290
then basically the marginal
utility of consumption,

00:57:53.290 --> 00:58:00.240
if we could deduce it,
would be not going anywhere.

00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:04.450
It would be the same over time.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:09.490
But again, with
r equal to delta,

00:58:09.490 --> 00:58:12.220
we kick on this extra
orthogonal shock,

00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.820
which makes the marginal utility
of consumption dispersing

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:18.580
in the future, relative today.

00:58:18.580 --> 00:58:21.310
And you can even
have r not equal

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:25.720
to delta, as long as
delta is greater than r.

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:31.050
The same logic applies
because you've kind of like

00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:35.390
amplified this thing, carrying
it through to tomorrow,

00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:37.420
along with the u shock.

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:47.430
So that's another way to get
at the variance of consumption

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:53.850
increasing, depending on what
you assume about the utility

00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:55.080
function.

00:58:55.080 --> 00:59:03.110
Some functions, though, have
a force that go the other way.

00:59:03.110 --> 00:59:06.650
In particular, if you're
really, really into it,

00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:11.080
you get into third derivatives.

00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:15.100
But when you're really
sort of cautious,

00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:21.200
that lambda is convex.

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.610
So you're taking a second
derivative of already

00:59:25.610 --> 00:59:26.650
the marginal utility.

00:59:26.650 --> 00:59:29.500
That's why I commented about
third derivatives of utility

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:30.970
functions.

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:34.610
And that, if you start
staring at this thing,

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:40.580
can actually push you back
against this dispersion

00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:41.854
of consumption.

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.990
So I'm having a sense that
this is going on and on.

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:05.170
But the point is to take each
of these different forces

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:08.140
and then tell stories about
what must be true in Taiwan,

01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:12.680
versus Britain,
versus the US, to try

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:18.970
to rationalize what
we're seeing in the data,

01:00:18.970 --> 01:00:20.380
and similarly, here.

01:00:25.980 --> 01:00:29.220
So let's just say three words
about excess smoothness.

01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:35.610
To repeat, the
lifecycle model implies

01:00:35.610 --> 01:00:38.550
that shocks to permanent income
should be fully incorporated

01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:44.150
into consumption,
while innovations

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:48.335
to the transitory part are not.

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:57.240
Basically, all the income--

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.890
all the transitory
income fluctuations

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:03.837
should not be appearing in
consumption, which actually

01:01:03.837 --> 01:01:05.670
is something we've
talked about with regards

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:07.590
to the full risk-sharing
model, except there,

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.080
we didn't make this
distinction between

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.960
transitory and permanent.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:18.750
But when they go and
look at the data,

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:21.280
they say, hey,
consumption is too smooth.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:25.950
It doesn't react to innovations
in the permanent component.

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:29.505
And other people have
found something similar.

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:35.920
And we're inching
forward to models

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.120
where we're going to need
to modify the models.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.120
We're going to have to
introduce something else,

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:45.640
like private information,
and more on that in a second.

01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:54.290
Yup?

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:55.790
AUDIENCE: Why do
all these assume

01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:58.110
the market is incomplete?

01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:01.590
So maybe just because the
market is relatively complete,

01:02:01.590 --> 01:02:04.698
so these [INAUDIBLE]?

01:02:04.698 --> 01:02:06.490
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So
that's my gut reaction.

01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:15.580
Actually, so this
Pavoni paper puts

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:22.280
in sort of some unobserved
savings and other things.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.880
And it actually comes
close to the data.

01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:28.930
So it isn't all the way
toward full insurance,

01:02:28.930 --> 01:02:33.670
but it is more full insurance
than what these models imply.

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:38.440
So it's trying to
reconcile the puzzle.

01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:45.335
I'd like to think
I'm quite agnostic.

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:52.310
In my rural [? Thai ?]
data, certainly,

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:54.920
when you include other variables
and not just consumption,

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:56.870
we see rejections of
full risk-sharing.

01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:59.000
I'm not determined
to always find

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.160
full risk-sharing in the data.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.580
But likewise, I would hope
these guys aren't clinging

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.430
to the permanent income model
as the only game in town,

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:11.700
because it's clearly
also suffering

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:17.370
from its own sort of anomalies,
relative to the data.

01:03:19.927 --> 01:03:21.510
And there's no reason
to think that it

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:28.095
has to be this same model for
every village or every country,

01:03:28.095 --> 01:03:29.790
and actually,
Deaton and Paxson's

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:31.650
stuff, looking at the
cross sections, kind

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:33.000
of saying that it's different.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.833
It could be different
in different countries

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:37.470
if you're going to try
to reconcile the observed

01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:38.473
movements.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:46.180
But anyway, you guys need to
know about this literature.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:53.170
You need to have a view of the
different consumption smoothing

01:03:53.170 --> 01:03:54.370
literature.

01:03:54.370 --> 01:04:00.750
I guess I should
also say sort of,

01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:06.270
it looks as though it's a
macro-ish, US-ish literature.

01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:09.960
But that's not true, certainly,
for Paxson and Deaton, who

01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.040
are avid development economists
and looking at that data

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.330
from developing countries.

01:04:16.330 --> 01:04:19.420
And likewise, the initial
risk-sharing stuff,

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:21.370
that wasn't peculiar
to development.

01:04:21.370 --> 01:04:23.830
That was being tested
by Cochrane and Mace

01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:26.050
and so on in US data.

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:30.040
So there's really
never been this idea

01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:34.780
that somehow macro is in one
room, using one subset of data,

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:38.650
and micro is another room,
using another subset.

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:40.360
That would be rather silly.

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.760
So we really need to know
how all these models work.

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:57.690
So this is, again, Campbell's
saving for a rainy day.

01:05:01.055 --> 01:05:02.930
It's repeated because
it's a different paper.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:07.950
They look at--

01:05:07.950 --> 01:05:14.330
Campbell and Deaton now
are looking at US data

01:05:14.330 --> 01:05:16.370
and saying the labor
income is described

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:22.280
by this autoregressive
process with a positive serial

01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:23.120
correlation.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:31.740
And what that means is
innovations are, quote unquote,

01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:34.680
"more than permanent,"
not just random walk-ish,

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.770
but basically--

01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:38.670
Now you get even
into more trouble

01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:41.880
because if consumption should
reflect the innovations

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.370
to permanent income, and
what you see in innovations

01:05:44.370 --> 01:05:47.910
is more than permanent,
that means consumption

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:51.090
should respond even more.

01:05:51.090 --> 01:05:54.660
And it's not, in the data,
responding that much.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:58.080
It's much less variable.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:00.090
So either they're
getting this fact wrong.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:07.440
Or, again, maybe the households
have more information somehow.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:12.690
Or they have stupid
expectations or whatever.

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:16.470
These guys were not able
to resolve the puzzle.

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:18.520
If you want to see the
equations, there they are.

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:21.720
I'm not sure at this point
that it adds all that much

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.442
more to the discussion.

01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:33.380
And this is what I was saying
about Attanasio and Pavoni.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:42.642
So the plan is--

01:06:42.642 --> 01:06:44.100
there's a little
more coming today.

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.870
Don't worry.

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:49.190
Or you might say, oh, darn.

01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:51.630
But the plan in the
ordering of the lectures

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:58.050
is to do labor
and wage variation

01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:03.090
and smoothing, adding labor
supply to a consumption model,

01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:07.230
and talk about elasticities
and sensitivities.

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:10.110
That will be done with both
the full risk-sharing model,

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:14.580
as well as a version of these
incomplete market models.

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:18.450
So we'll see what survives,
depending on what you assume

01:07:18.450 --> 01:07:20.400
about the market structure.

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:25.200
And then we're going to go to
have a whole lecture on models

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:29.910
that are much more explicit
about moral hazard, unobserved

01:07:29.910 --> 01:07:34.120
income, and so on.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:38.760
And this Pavoni paper is one
of them in that literature.

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:41.070
We're not going to
cover it in class.

01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:57.200
So actually, the front part of
the lecture was about this BPP.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:00.730
It's probably a bit
mysterious what it was,

01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:02.620
so we can review
that for a second.

01:08:05.730 --> 01:08:19.729
The idea is that you
postulate that log of earnings

01:08:19.729 --> 01:08:24.200
takes on this process where
x is a vector of shocks,

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:30.609
a is some vector
of coefficients,

01:08:30.609 --> 01:08:38.420
the shocks are IID, the x's
are, and they have variances.

01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:46.130
This allows a whole bunch of
stuff, not only just random

01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:52.140
walks, but autoregressive
integrated moving

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:56.340
average processes on income.

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.609
This is what you see.

01:08:58.609 --> 01:09:00.899
And then this
general formulation

01:09:00.899 --> 01:09:06.779
allows a bunch of different
specifications, which they're

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:08.010
going to try to estimate.

01:09:15.519 --> 01:09:18.520
And somehow what
they want to back out

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.609
is this insurance coefficient.

01:09:21.609 --> 01:09:25.090
So here's, again, how it's
easy to get turned around.

01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:28.210
This is how a sort of,
like, quote unquote,

01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:31.479
a regression coefficient
of how consumption

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:37.370
is moving with this particular
shock, inferred somehow.

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:42.910
But 1 minus that is then
the degree of insurance

01:09:42.910 --> 01:09:46.630
because when consumption
doesn't move with that shock,

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:47.819
this is zero.

01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:51.670
And so insurance is like,
perfect, measured at 1.

01:09:58.460 --> 01:10:01.430
And you could put
t's on these things

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:08.030
if you sort the data by
age, which came up earlier.

01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:24.630
So we don't really see
all those permanent

01:10:24.630 --> 01:10:26.385
versus transitory shocks.

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:31.635
You kind of have to
infer them, somehow.

01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:50.810
And this is a bit like
using some assumed function

01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:57.360
on the income process,
and then filtering

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:02.328
the data through that function
and looking at the covariance

01:11:02.328 --> 01:11:03.120
with income change.

01:11:06.370 --> 01:11:08.070
But they don't just
do three alone,

01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:15.590
because this would be a
statement about income alone.

01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:22.360
They jointly estimate this
function, g, essentially,

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.830
jointly with consumption.

01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:55.120
So for example, if
you assume income

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:58.690
took on this classic form
that we were actually

01:11:58.690 --> 01:12:01.930
tracking through the
lectures, then income

01:12:01.930 --> 01:12:09.430
would be the sum of a random
walk with its own innovation

01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:12.400
and variance and
epsilon, which would

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:18.780
be this IID transitory shock.

01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:22.820
If you believe this to be the
structure, and there are many,

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:27.520
many other candidates, then
you take a first difference.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.510
And by construction
then, what would be left

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:38.420
would be this innovation in
the permanent part and a time

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:41.360
difference in the
transitory part, which

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.680
is still transitory.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.990
So then the consumption
model tells you about--

01:12:54.910 --> 01:13:03.420
puts restrictions on how
the change in consumption

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:15.360
should be responding, basically
taking advantage of the time

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:15.930
delays.

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:19.500
As you go back like,
two, three periods,

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.020
there is nothing that
happened that far back that's

01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.550
influencing anything
at all today.

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:29.640
So those past data kind of
become predetermined variables,

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.390
almost as if they
were instruments.

01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:39.150
And so that kind of mysterious
notation about g on y, this

01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:42.960
is a version of it,
postulating a model

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:47.400
and then going back far
enough time, so you would see,

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:49.650
basically, zero covariance.

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.570
So here it is, actually.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:08.110
This g is just basically
the time difference

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:12.990
in income at t plus 1.

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.590
And given the other
assumptions they make,

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:25.700
you back out some of the
key things that you want.

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:27.950
For example, how on
earth are we going

01:14:27.950 --> 01:14:30.290
to know about the variance
of the transitory shocks

01:14:30.290 --> 01:14:34.340
if we never see
transitory shocks?

01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:38.930
Basically, that turns out to be
the covariance of two things we

01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:43.700
do see, the time difference
of consumption at income at t

01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:47.852
and the time difference
of income at t plus 1.

01:14:47.852 --> 01:14:49.310
Hopefully, you're
seeing the spirit

01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:54.442
of this, if not following
every line of the algebra.

01:14:54.442 --> 01:14:55.900
So that's where we
get that object.

01:14:59.250 --> 01:15:00.860
And how would you
get the variance

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:03.410
of the permanent income
part, the innovation

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:05.350
to permanent income?

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:09.210
Remember, that thing is
persisting over time.

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:11.540
So it's a bit more complicated.

01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:20.660
It turns out to be this
daunting object, which

01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:23.090
is to-- and everything
here you see.

01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:24.260
That's point number one.

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:26.540
It's the covariance of the
time difference of income

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:33.530
at t, against the sum of the
changes in income at t minus 1,

01:15:33.530 --> 01:15:35.730
t and t plus 1.

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:41.600
So there, again, you see this
sort of time structure at work.

01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:45.640
The spirit of it is go
back far enough in time

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.440
so everything is predetermined.

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.710
And this is the
covariance of consumption

01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:55.900
with that permanent shock.

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:58.290
So this is a key object.

01:15:58.290 --> 01:16:01.210
Remember, that insurance formula
is, how much is consumption

01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:06.780
moving with the innovation
to permanent income?

01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:12.190
It all seems quite mysterious,
but here is an explicit formula

01:16:12.190 --> 01:16:13.440
for how they get it.

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:20.130
So clearly, it's a
linear model, using

01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:22.260
a lot of these variance
covariance formulas,

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:25.682
given the assumed structure.

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:27.390
They don't have to--
their starting point

01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:30.960
could have been something else.

01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:33.150
As I said, you had
these ARIMA processes,

01:16:33.150 --> 01:16:35.070
but it is some structure.

01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:39.660
When you specify the order
of the moving average part

01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.690
and the order of the
autoregressive part,

01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:44.280
you get restrictions
on the data.

01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:52.400
So hopefully that helps
resolve some of the mysteries

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:57.750
about what this BPP algorithm
and what they do to the data

01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:01.320
to measure these insurance
against idiosyncratic and

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:03.780
permanent shocks.

01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:05.280
So I'm going to
leave for [? Whit ?]

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:13.010
to do the version of smoothing,
a bit in the Italian data.

01:17:13.010 --> 01:17:16.410
But I will just say,
by way of motivation,

01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:19.490
it's again looking
at various models,

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:21.860
although they're
not exactly nested,

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:26.150
and looking at the
responses of consumption

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:32.330
to innovations, but also
of wealth to innovations.

01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:37.220
So we saw in my data sort of
how wealth in various lectures

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:39.260
is moving around in
the cross section

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:41.990
and moving around over time.

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.180
We talked about
responses to shocks

01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:48.110
and whether they're using
savings accounts and so on.

01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:52.490
So these guys in their own way
are doing something similar.

01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:57.470
And the paper backs
out the movements

01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:59.930
in consumption and
wealth that are predicted

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:01.670
from certain kinds
of innovations,

01:18:01.670 --> 01:18:05.450
but not just between this year
and next year, but this year

01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:09.210
and two years from now, all
the way up to six years,

01:18:09.210 --> 01:18:10.590
or even longer.

01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:14.240
So you kind of get the
sort of time profiles

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:16.090
of responsiveness.

01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:20.030
And very much in the spirit of
what we're talking about today,

01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:23.382
yet again, a bit different,
those response patterns

01:18:23.382 --> 01:18:25.340
are very different,
depending on whether you're

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:30.390
talking about the permanent
income model or the life cycle

01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:32.180
buffer stock type model.

01:18:35.970 --> 01:18:38.030
That's all for today.

00:00:27.687 --> 00:00:32.070
PROFESSOR: So we had a
big lecture last time

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.720
on perfect insurance and
implications for targeting,

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.290
and policy, and evaluations.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.420
There is a series
of lectures now

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.120
that have to do with working
off of that basic risk sharing

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.500
framework.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.770
Today we're going to talk about
the implications for what we

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.290
should see in rates of return.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.420
And then next class,
we're going to talk

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:09.460
about alternative models of what
we might see in the consumption

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.118
data.

00:01:12.118 --> 00:01:13.660
And then the lecture
after that we're

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.260
going to return to the
perfect market model

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.910
and think about labor supply.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.400
And then finally, we're going
to get to explicit obstacles

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.270
to trade.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.810
I must say that rather
than put off the obstacles,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.630
we've been noting
and even talking

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.780
about alternative
models along the way.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.490
Because these
benchmarks are sometimes

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.010
rejected and you're going to
see that a bit today as well.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.940
So this perfect market
standard within villages

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.570
that has to do with
relatives and friends

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.210
interacting with each
other has implications

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.520
for how you adjust for risk.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.860
And we're going to do
that with a vengeance.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.920
But it will turn
out that it does--

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.530
that framework allows us
to distinguish aggregate

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.790
from idiosyncratic risk.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.020
And the idiosyncratic
risk should not

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.800
be showing up in rates of
return, but it does at the end.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.050
And then I'll say a few
words about what else

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.930
we know about the
tie data in terms

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.440
of the decomposition
of volatility

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.710
linking back to a
paper we saw the very

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:39.560
first lecture on quantifying
the growth rates by sector.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.220
But we're going to
do it by wealth.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.490
At least I'll say a
few words about it.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:51.360
And then I'm going to toward the
end of the class sort of return

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.880
to this idea that
either things aren't

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.080
perfect and/or people
are making mistakes.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.700
And we'll do that in
some unusual contexts,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.550
one that has to do
with data from Sweden,

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.860
an unusually rich
database from Sweden,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.750
and another that has to
do with the US airlines.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.850
But the basic frameworks
that are getting

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.330
used, whether in the
developing context, or Sweden,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.030
or US airlines, are
basically all the same.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.970
So there is a strong
complementarity

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.020
across these papers.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.800
This paper with Chris has
been in the works for a while.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.370
But we are now able to use you
know 13 years of monthly data.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.890
So we are doing
better than before.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.230
So we want to talk about risk
and return of productive assets

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.520
in developing countries.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.300
We already looked at some
of the slides showing

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.530
how rates of return differ a
lot across different households,

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.750
differ in large part
by wealth and how

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.070
poor people have relatively
high rates of return.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.090
And they're saving.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.050
And they're accumulating
assets and so on.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.160
Another way people look at
rates of return is to say,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.540
you know, well, some people
are more talented than others.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.840
So if we look at
rates of return,

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.380
we get some notion of
underlying productivity

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.900
as in TFP and so on.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.960
We've had many
lectures about TFP

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.500
and coefficients in
front multiplying

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.890
in front of production
functions and so on.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.750
But correct me if I'm wrong.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.390
Nowhere in any of that stuff
did we ever adjust for risk.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.220
So what's the intuition
for adjusting for risk?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:05:00.670
Well, if you want to look at
compensating differentials,

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.370
the higher the risk of a
project, the higher the rate

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.020
of return ought to be.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.300
Other things equal to
compensate for that risk.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.440
You know, like junk
bonds have higher yields

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.360
and so on and so forth.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.720
So maybe these guys with
seemingly very high rates

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.370
of return actually are
just doing risky things.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:24.720
And indeed, if enough of them
do risky things and on average

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.240
some of them succeed
and maybe that

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.960
would generate the
high rate of return.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.655
So we really need to think
about how to measure the risk.

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.450
And we're going to
rely on finance theory.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:46.080
But I'll be very
careful to sort of build

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.240
into it the economic models.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.110
You may learn a little bit of
finance jargon along the way.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.180
But I'm not going
to start with that.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.850
I'll get you up to speed.

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.090
It's really not that hard when
you look at the equations.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.030
OK, so what do we find?

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:17.905
We do find that higher
risk is associated

00:06:17.905 --> 00:06:19.030
with higher rate of return.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:24.070
But the risk that we're
going to be concentrating on

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.860
in the model is not
idiosyncratic risk.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.110
It's village level risk.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.540
So when you think about
households together pooling

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.800
resources, as in a
risk sharing syndicate,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.100
they would care about say
aggregate consumption should

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.440
move individual consumption.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.470
And idiosyncratic
income shock should not

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.270
have an influence
on consumption.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.315
So when is something
really valuable?

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.650
A project is
valuable when it has

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.070
a return, which is negatively
correlated with the village

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.330
average return.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.930
So that the resources
come in when you need it.

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.890
So the quote market,
the way the finance guys

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.615
would use it, for
us is the village.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:24.110
And indeed, the more a household
has a return on its projects

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.410
that are correlated with
the village average return,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.850
the higher is going to be the
measured expected or average

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:33.505
return on that
household's assets.

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:40.140
And we have all kinds of ways
of adjusting for human capital

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.990
and so on, which I'll get into.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.790
As I said though,
it does in the end

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:48.940
leave some idiosyncratic risk.

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.865
And that's also generating
higher expected returns.

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.260
Aggregate and idiosyncratic
risk is negatively

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.940
correlated with age.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:07.250
So the older a household
head basically,

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:12.130
the quote, less risky
things that they're doing.

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:15.020
But both in the idiosyncratic
and aggregate sense

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.300
they tend to do things which are
less correlated with a village

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.630
average.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.040
It's negative with wealth.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:32.260
Meaning the lower is wealth, the
higher both the idiosyncratic

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:33.460
and aggregate.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.970
So this gets us into
poor people and how

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.549
exposed are they to risk?

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:43.610
We've seen a bit of that
already in risk and return

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.120
in village India that there
are some landless laborers

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.960
and labor income that tends to
move consumption around more.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.950
This is a bit different way
of measuring it in the sense

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.160
that we're not going to look so
much at the consumption data.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.760
We're going to assume everyone
is in this risk sharing

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:02.360
syndicate.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.040
But we turn around
and see what is

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.360
reflected in rates of return.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.580
And in particular,
relatively poor people

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.680
are more exposed to risk.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.950
But it's not just their
own idiosyncratic risk.

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:18.930
It's the aggregate risk.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:36.390
And there is a little bit
of role for education.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.940
But it's kind of problematic.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:40.370
And there's some selection
bias that I might

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:41.600
talk about when we get there.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:48.080
And then this is
maybe the punch line.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.700
If you want to
think about talent,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.510
then you want to adjust
for all sources of risk.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.200
And when we do that, we
find who are seemingly

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.260
the really productive
people in the village.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.870
And all of a sudden, it's
the higher wealth people

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.440
who have the higher risk
adjusted rate of return

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:11.050
and female headed households.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.410
So relatively wealthy
females actually

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:17.690
dominate in terms of getting
a higher rate of return.

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.330
So we have a basic model.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:27.220
They're going to be j households
and l production activities.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:32.290
Each activity utilizes
capital as an input.

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:36.700
And let's simplify and
say all these technologies

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:39.790
produce the same thing,
consumption goods.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.960
And we'll simplify further and
assume all the technologies are

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.080
linear.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:45.785
Yeah, Matt.

00:10:45.785 --> 00:10:47.160
AUDIENCE: Can I
just actually ask

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.868
a couple of things
about previous slides?

00:10:48.868 --> 00:10:53.400
So are we assuming there's
no sharing between them?

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.370
PROFESSOR: So we
are again, going

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:05.090
to take a stand on our baseline.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:07.180
And it's actually
going to be all four

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:10.630
villages in a province,
not just a single village.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.370
But then we go back and check
for villages individually.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:18.160
And we actually go back further
and look one network at a time.

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.960
The basic results don't change.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.360
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.580
Another thing which I
don't really understand

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:28.850
is when we have this
result that returns

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:31.155
risk adjusted returns
are lower for those

00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:33.430
with lower [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.410
How do we think about
in terms of one story's

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.370
that the people with
low initial wealth,

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.250
they're very productive
people amongst them.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:44.680
But [INAUDIBLE] get sufficient
size of their business.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.430
So their marginal returns
might be really high.

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.580
And the average returns
as well, depending on--

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.080
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
so this paper isn't

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.288
going to help much with that.

00:11:53.288 --> 00:11:55.570
Because we're going to
assume linear technologies.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:58.058
And margins are going
to be equal to averages.

00:11:58.058 --> 00:11:58.600
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.670
PROFESSOR: And more
generally, you know,

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.860
wealth is clearly an
endogenous variable.

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.710
So we're not saying high wealth
is causing people to have--

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.010
I mean, it's more likely
the other way around.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:17.530
But yeah, we've gone
through a series of models

00:12:17.530 --> 00:12:20.080
where wealth helps
overcome constraints.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.760
The first four lectures
were like that.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.330
So in a way, this is another
fact finding mission.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:29.040
But it's not just
data summaries.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.220
It's looking at the data
through the lens of the model.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:38.130
And you have to make some
assumptions to do that.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:44.380
OK, so we have j
production activities.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:46.030
We're going to start
the economy off

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:48.880
with some aggregate wealth, w.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:53.440
And those are basically
the projects, the assets,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.970
or the trees if you like.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.980
And those projects
are going to have

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.160
rates of return, the fruit.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.110
So at the beginning
of the period,

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:07.470
the total sort of
wealth available

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.570
is the sum of the
trees and the fruit.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.040
So this is a standard kind
of solo reversible capital

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.630
assumption that the assets
can basically be sold.

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:20.100
There's no irreversibility.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.800
You can convert them into
consumption if you choose to.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.360
So we're going to
have a social planner

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.560
sort of directing
the show, which

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.330
is not to say this might not
decentralize in some way.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:42.240
That said, I want to
emphasize it's not

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:47.130
like finance in the sense that
people participate on the New

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.440
York Stock Exchange or
the financial markets,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.750
and they're buying
and selling stocks.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.630
We don't even have the data
of all these capital goods.

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.850
That's not the mechanism.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.040
This planner's problem may
be decentralized in some way.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.960
But it's just much
more straightforward,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.910
just like when we
did the risk sharing

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.950
stuff not to
necessarily be forced

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.920
into some interpretation.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.860
We're just going to solve the
planning problem directly.

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:19.470
So somehow or other, a
household is assigned.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:24.320
Household j is assigned capital
and is operating project type

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.360
i.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.340
And this is the
net rate of return.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.780
Notice that we allow
individuals to vary

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:33.640
in their rates of return.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.860
The planner could
take advantage if it

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.740
knows that some people are
better than other people

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.620
at doing things.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.680
So we're not just
getting rid of talent.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:47.600
We're embedding it at some
level in these rates of return.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:57.203
And then they have basically
the tree and the fruit.

00:14:57.203 --> 00:14:58.370
That's their starting point.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:01.730
And then they get taxes
and transfers, these Taus.

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:05.210
I mean, here it's written
positive as if it's incoming

00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:08.180
and adds to the resources
of the household.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.350
But in fact, like a
risk sharing group

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:18.480
you can give and get and
contribute to the social fund.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:24.380
So the planning problem
is to maximize discounted

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.390
weighted expected utility.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.300
So these Lambda j weights
are the pareto weights

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:32.090
for households type j.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:35.780
They're not necessarily the
same over all the households.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:39.860
And this whole term here
is the utility function,

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:46.660
which as noted, is just
the return on the trees

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:50.240
plus these transfers.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:58.240
And then discounted
expected return for tomorrow

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.900
I usually write as Beta.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.160
But anyway, it's an
intertemporal discount rate.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.640
And so you have the
value function today

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:12.140
given wealth today and expected
value of wealth tomorrow w

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.550
prime.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:17.170
And wealth today
can be allocated

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:20.830
into basically consumption.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.770
So this is just
summing over not only

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.640
over all projects for household
j, but all households j.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.270
So this is again,
just consumption.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:35.620
So consumption plus
capital allocated tomorrow

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:41.380
equals total wealth, pretty
standard kind of growth market

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:42.442
structure.

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:50.670
And what is total
wealth of the economy?

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:53.580
It's basically not only
the fruit of the trees,

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:54.990
but the trees themselves.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:00.470
So you can take this expression
and put it on the right hand

00:17:00.470 --> 00:17:02.870
side if you want.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:04.609
Because they have
pre-existing capital.

00:17:04.609 --> 00:17:06.710
They have the rate
of return on that.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.540
You've got total
resources available.

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.940
You can allocate
it to consumption

00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:14.950
or set some aside to continue
the capital stock for tomorrow.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.380
And so we just substitute
in the expressions

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:31.330
for tomorrow's wealth and
today's wealth for that matter.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.280
And then this odd
looking thing here

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.980
is just a substitution
from the previous equation.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:41.640
But there's a common
term on both sides.

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:43.110
That's why it looks
kind of weird.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:48.600
Because this is really 1
plus r times k over here.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.090
But there's also a 1
plus r times k here.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.580
And the rk things
are canceling out.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.680
So this is just
straightforward algebra.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.560
So we're going to
maximize this thing

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.120
by choosing the transfer as
Tau j and the assignments

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.560
of tomorrow's capital stock.

00:18:10.512 --> 00:18:12.972
AUDIENCE: Was there
supposed to be uncertainty?

00:18:12.972 --> 00:18:15.440
It's just their
return on capital?

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.930
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.226
Yeah, there's no
preference shocks here.

00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:23.138
AUDIENCE: What's the
process [INAUDIBLE]??

00:18:23.138 --> 00:18:24.530
[INAUDIBLE]

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.612
PROFESSOR: Don't
have to specify yet.

00:18:26.612 --> 00:18:28.090
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.290
PROFESSOR: That's
probably a good thing.

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:36.800
OK, so if you looked, we've
actually seen this before.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.700
But it's explicit here again.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:43.970
Consumption and capital
are interrelated through

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.170
this resource constraint.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.890
So when you take a derivative
to maximize with respect

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:52.250
to the transfers, you'll
pick up a derivative

00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:54.560
in the utility function.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.590
And the sum of total
transfers is down here

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:58.750
in the resource constraint.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.150
And there's a Lagrange
multiplier in front of it,

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:01.910
right?

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.650
So you're going to
get margin weighted,

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.110
margin utility of
consumption today

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:08.265
equal to a Lagrange multiplier.

00:19:08.265 --> 00:19:09.890
And when you
differentiate with respect

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:15.120
to the choice of tomorrow's
capital stock k prime,

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:17.280
well, that's going to
enter in tomorrow's value.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.940
So you'll have a derivative
of the value function

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.690
and then internally this
sort of rate of return.

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:32.540
And this prime thing is also
entering into the same resource

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.040
constraint.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.707
So you're going to
get the same Lagrange

00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:39.140
multiplier as on consumption.

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:43.480
So here is a summary
of those words.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.060
Weighted margin
utilities are equated

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.290
across all the households to a
common contemporaneous Lagrange

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.030
multiplier.

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.930
And then this is kind of a--

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:01.450
it's an exactly Euler equation
for capital accumulation.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:04.510
This is the price
of capital today.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.410
It's how much consumption
you're giving up.

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.340
And this is expected
discounted value

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:11.350
of having capital tomorrow.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.810
It's the derivative
of the value function

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:16.180
times the rate of
return, depending

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.450
on which project i
and J is being chosen.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:25.550
Note that this is for every
project, every capital stock

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:28.220
of type i for household j.

00:20:31.426 --> 00:20:34.850
Now, so far I've talked
about real assets.

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.790
But it's not too hard.

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.330
And we do actually allow
external borrowing.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:45.710
You could imagine a village
is able to borrow in land.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:48.590
Or the whole set
of four villages

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:52.260
have some relationship with the
rest of the external economy.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:56.040
That still leaves
this sub problem.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.030
I mean, throwing
these things in might

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.370
deliver some extra conditions
that we're ignoring.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.787
But what we're doing is not
inconsistent with having

00:21:03.787 --> 00:21:04.370
this equation.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.330
All right, so if you
just take this one

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:21.245
and divide both sides
through by Mu, you get this.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.710
And then you take the
expectation operator

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:31.690
in front of everything,
including Mu,

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:36.470
even though it's not random
from the point of day t.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:41.510
And then you can
rewrite this guy here

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:46.040
as something called m or m
prime, since in effect it's

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.840
for tomorrow.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:55.520
And this r prime ij is
basically capital R is little r.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.040
One plus r is sort of
the gross rate of return.

00:22:00.910 --> 00:22:05.550
So this is hopefully
not mysterious.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:09.000
It's just basically a
relabeling of variables.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.930
And it's like the
Euler equation.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:14.720
But if you want to
impress your friends

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:17.510
and bewilder your enemies,
you call this thing

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:21.580
the stochastic discount factor.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:25.860
But all it is is the
way society as a whole

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.360
is discounting the future.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:33.310
It's tomorrow's sort of shadow
price of resources relative

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:35.040
to today's.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.800
So you're discounting tomorrow.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.960
And it's random.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.820
Because these rates
of return are random.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.090
And so the amount of resources
available in the economy

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.290
is likely random.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:47.490
So it's stochastic.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.260
There's a danger in
talking to someone

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.060
about stochastic
discount factors.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:00.980
Because the conversation
will keep going.

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.720
And you may learn more
or get bewildered.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:07.230
But anyway, as promised,
we'll keep track of this.

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:18.540
So it's true for all
households, all sectors.

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.427
And the finance
jargon is we just

00:23:22.427 --> 00:23:24.010
looked at something
called the pricing

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:27.850
equation in the consumption
based asset pricing world.

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.850
But for us it's just an
Euler equation holding

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:34.300
at say the village or let's
call it township level.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.740
Another thing you may or may not
know or remember from finance

00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:46.280
is you can take assets
and bundle them.

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.110
So you can have a
particular asset

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.410
held by a particular
household, a project.

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.650
Or you could take a
collection of assets.

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.670
That Euler equation has to
hold for any asset individually

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.320
and all assets collectively.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.890
You can bundle, package,
rebundle anyway you want.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.140
And anything that's
actually held--

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:12.960
by the way, there's sort of
out of equilibrium projects

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.850
we're not seeing.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:19.290
They wouldn't satisfy
the Euler equation.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.170
They have a low rate of return
relative to the other ones.

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:24.060
So we're only seeing
these equilibrium ones

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:26.310
that the households
actually hold.

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:30.000
And of course, we're looking at
the data at what they actually

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.530
hold.

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.630
I'm mentioning this
bundling because--

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.070
and you'll see it again.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.790
But we might as well get
our minds around it here.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.030
We are going to look at a
household's rate of return.

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:47.700
And typical households, as you
know, you've already seen this,

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.610
are doing more than one thing.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:54.240
Some of the incoming money
is from labor supply.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.550
They have crops,
maybe multiple crops.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:01.800
Some of them have both that
and a business and so on.

00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:06.540
We try very hard to assign
these assets individually

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:08.340
to particular activities.

00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:09.660
But it's kind of treacherous.

00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:11.700
And we're likely
to make mistakes.

00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.800
What do you do with a
pickup truck for example?

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.260
Is that just used in farming?

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.860
Or they're going to the bank.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.070
They're taking the
kids to school.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:22.770
And so rather than
face all of that

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.350
we just aggregate up
over all the activities

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:29.460
any particular household
is doing and call that

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.750
a collection of assets.

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:34.460
And the Euler
equation should apply.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:36.330
Now, remember a little
bit of your sort

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:44.670
of econometrics with means
and variances or easy mistakes

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:45.810
to make.

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.000
The expectation of
two random variables

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.250
is not just the product
of the expectations.

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:56.540
You've got to adjust
for the covariance,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.180
unless this happens to be zero.

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:02.270
But this covariance is
going to be crucial for us.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:07.700
Because you can see already
it's the covariance between dare

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:10.010
I say it, the stochastic
discount factor,

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:14.060
which reflects the community's
relative valuation of resources

00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:20.390
and the particular return on
project i held by household j.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:27.460
So since we already had
this equal to 1 as the Euler

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:30.820
equation, right?

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:36.190
So now we just substitute
this stuff into here.

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:38.130
And we get this.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:42.690
And you could basically divide
through by the expectation

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:45.450
of m prime.

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:49.470
You're going to get 1 over
that here, get rid of it here.

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.010
Get the covariance
divided by it here.

00:26:53.010 --> 00:26:55.050
And then you divide
and multiply,

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.810
which doesn't do any
harm, by the variance

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.800
of m prime and rearrange terms.

00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:06.100
So you get this thing.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.180
So we're finally
arriving at something

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:14.520
close to what we want, which
is the expected rate of return,

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:15.980
which is going to
be in the data,

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.980
the average return for household
j over all the time periods.

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.480
Not quite.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:25.920
It sort of looks like
a linear function,

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.810
something with an intercept,
and then Beta Lambda.

00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:36.030
Beta, and finance guys talk
about betas all the time.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:40.530
Beta for us just means sort
of the normalized covariance

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:47.710
between the returns on ij
and the stochastic discount

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:51.030
factor, which I already
pointed to above.

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.080
It's normalized by
the overall variance.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.060
So that's kind of
the risk factor,

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.810
or the quantity of risk.

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:06.440
And this other thing could
be called the price of risk.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.210
But it's nothing
other than this.

00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:10.190
It's the variance
divided by the mean.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.560
It almost looks like a
coefficient of variation,

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.669
like Sigma squared divided
by Mu or something.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:30.800
And there's a name for it.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:35.280
And I'll tell you what
it is in a second.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.000
All right, so this is
what I said already.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.280
Quantities, prices--
oh, and one more thing.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.490
What was that intercept?

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.460
Well basically,
let's just define

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.760
this thing, this Gamma,
well, it was already

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:56.420
defined to be 1 over the
expectation of m prime.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.215
But let's call it
the risk free return.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:07.470
First of all, why
is there no risk?

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:10.080
Because all the
variability in the economy

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:16.290
is in m prime or the one that
we care about for that equation.

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:18.250
And we've already
taken the expectation.

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.920
So there's nothing random left.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.910
So this is a number.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:25.360
It's not something stochastic.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.440
It should be obvious.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:30.220
But I always do it myself, which
is take that to be an asset,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.940
plug that back into the
asset Euler equation

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:36.850
that we already have and
thus convince yourself

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.690
that that equation applies
for the risk free return.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:45.610
And you'll get this
right back again, OK?

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:53.190
So anyway, the point is risk
free because the covariance

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:57.030
of this risk free rate with
m prime is 0 by construction.

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:21.660
So let's just look
at this again.

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:27.940
This is the rate of return
of the mean, or average, rate

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.940
of return on project ij.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:32.900
Subtract off the risk free rate.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.450
This is the return differential.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:37.540
This is how much the--

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.800
in finance, it would be
like the junk bond premium

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.120
over and above treasuries.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:50.490
And so that difference
is sort of the premium

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:55.050
that you get for
holding a risky asset.

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:59.790
And it's linearly
related to the covariance

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:01.280
of that asset with the market.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:08.400
So again, I'm going back
and forth a bit more

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.870
with this finance language.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:12.300
But it's just all right
off the Euler equation.

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:19.320
This is just standard
sort of manipulation.

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.750
So we can even make
it more obvious

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:28.800
if you're wondering
what m prime really is.

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.340
Let's go with quadratic utility.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.856
So this is the form of it.

00:31:34.856 --> 00:31:40.060
The community's value function
as a function of wealth

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:44.560
is just basically the squared
of the difference between wealth

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:51.680
and some subsistence level with
a coefficient in front of it.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.230
So of course, if you
take the derivative of it

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:58.340
with respect to w
the twos cancel out.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:01.640
And you get eta times this
difference, which is linear,

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.570
by the way.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:04.250
That's huge.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:09.350
So marginal value of
wealth is linear in wealth.

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.380
That's what you
get at a quadratic.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.150
And then you just substitute
our expression for w

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:22.570
prime tomorrow into
that expression

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:25.770
and do a little relabeling.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:28.560
So all of a sudden, this
looks like the return

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:35.390
on the village average and the
village average capital stock.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:37.460
OK, the village
average capital stock

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:40.580
is the sum of the
capital stocks allocated

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:43.040
over all the projects
and all the households,

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:47.120
as it should be to
be in total, right?

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.300
And then what is the
rate of return on it?

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:56.090
Well basically, it's like
a capital weighted return.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:59.720
So the total return
is coming from a bunch

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:01.130
of individual projects.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:04.760
So you just take the return
on all the individual projects

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.130
but weight them by the
capital being allocated

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:09.680
to those projects
and renormalize

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.930
by the total capital stock.

00:33:11.930 --> 00:33:14.645
So it's a portfolio
weighted return.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.800
That's just a definition.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.840
But of course, then
it looks like this.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.440
And you take this up
here and this here.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.513
And you realize that
there's things canceling.

00:33:28.513 --> 00:33:30.430
And that's why it's
really just equal to this.

00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:40.740
But we'll use this now.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.800
So m prime, which is
the derivative tomorrow,

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:47.430
is just this thing
divided by Mu.

00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:50.010
Remember we have to take
the current shadow price

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:53.430
and divide through.

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.190
And then this is all
additive and linear.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.780
So we get this.

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:12.460
And now, m prime here
looks like this plus this.

00:34:12.460 --> 00:34:14.810
This looks like a
constant term that doesn't

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:17.750
depend on the rate of return.

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:20.510
And this is a coefficient
premultiplying

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:21.989
the rate of return.

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:29.020
So it's starting to look like
a pretty convenient equation

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.440
for the stochastic
discount factor.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.474
It's linear, linear in the
village rate of return.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.750
And again, we have this
thing we already derived,

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:48.230
which was a manipulation
of the Euler equation.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.580
And everywhere you
see m prime, you

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:56.070
start substituting
a minus brm prime.

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:57.820
And then you got to
remember certain rules

00:34:57.820 --> 00:35:02.680
about covariance operators
and variance operators.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:06.430
Variance operators will square
coefficients in front of them.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:12.770
Covariance operators will
bring the coefficient outside.

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.790
There's a lot of
substitutions here.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:16.957
there's b's and b squares.

00:35:16.957 --> 00:35:18.790
And they're going to
cancel with each other.

00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:20.082
And you end up with this thing.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:25.120
So this says the expected
return, or sample

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:35.360
average return, should
just be the covariance

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:38.390
of the return with the market
with the village average

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:40.210
aggregate.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.490
By the way, we know
how to construct that.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:45.850
Because we have it in the data.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:50.790
And we have the
variance as well.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:56.150
And then this is just
the sort of coefficient

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.350
that multiplies it.

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:06.710
But that's what I was saying
about that coefficient

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:08.150
of variation.

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:09.860
It's a variance
divided by a mean.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.420
So where have we ended up?

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.670
Well, with that quadratic
we now have pretty much

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:26.170
an exact expression that
the expected rate of return

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:29.170
on project i run by
household j should just

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:34.510
be a linear function with
a common constant term that

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:38.740
has nothing do with
i and j and then

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:43.060
the covariance of
that household's

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:47.780
return with the village average
return, which is something

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.460
we can compute.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.810
Because if you start thinking
about this like a regression,

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:55.940
we'll know this from the data.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:58.250
We'll know this from the data.

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:00.140
I'll tell you how to
get it in a minute.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.600
And we'll just estimate
Lambda and Gamma.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.300
Well, not quite, Gamma we can
do something special with.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.160
But that's the idea.

00:37:10.437 --> 00:37:11.520
So I've said this already.

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.870
But it bears repeating.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.050
Our stuff looks a
lot like this cap m.

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.800
But the mechanism
is very different.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.970
We do not have
households trading assets

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.480
that are priced in
centralized markets.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:29.060
We're instead
optimally allocating

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.350
assets across
households, but then

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:37.360
not forcing them to
eat the return stream.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.700
Instead, they enter
into this risk syndicate

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:44.920
as if a social planner were
reallocating consumption.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:48.790
Whereas, in finance you kind
of assume you're an investor.

00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:51.160
You could do means and
variances and take some risks

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.090
on your portfolio.

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:56.590
And then you're going to eat
it or at least dynamically

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.745
optimize, eat some,
save some for tomorrow.

00:37:59.745 --> 00:38:00.870
But this is very different.

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.310
And it's key that
they don't have

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:06.550
to eat the returns off
their capital stock

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:09.280
or make their own independent
savings decisions.

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:22.460
And you've seen last
time building up to this

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:25.400
that households are sharing a
lot of risk with each other.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.890
And these informal village
money markets are quite active.

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.840
We called them a money
market last time.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.300
So we've already been
using that language.

00:38:37.255 --> 00:38:38.630
That's what this
slide is saying.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:41.120
That's just a reminder of what
we talked about last time.

00:38:44.795 --> 00:38:45.970
So data, it's monthly.

00:38:48.738 --> 00:38:51.030
I don't know what they're
called, four villages grouped

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:53.390
together in a tombone.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:56.840
So we kind of started adopting
this South Africa language.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.000
I don't know whether I like it.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.212
We're calling them townships.

00:39:01.212 --> 00:39:03.370
AUDIENCE: It has a slight
connotation [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:04.135
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:04.135 --> 00:39:09.350
AUDIENCE: It's rural and maybe
not the best place to be.

00:39:09.350 --> 00:39:10.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:15.010
So tombone is Thai for the fact
that we picked four at random

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:17.320
in this geographic area.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.180
But no one knows
what a tombone is.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:24.540
But clearly, townships
distinguishes it from villages.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.870
It's four villages
in the data anyway.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:31.980
You know all about
where they're located.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:36.240
Reminder that we started
in August of '98.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:40.630
We're going to ignore the
first four months basically.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:48.990
And use the data
from 1990 on, 1999.

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:54.240
We're still out
there at month 174.

00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.990
What we're going to use--

00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:58.170
and Chris and I
just basically redid

00:39:58.170 --> 00:40:02.350
this in the last few weeks--

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:08.340
we're going to use month five
to 160 or basically 156 months,

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:18.110
or 13 full years of the data at
the monthly level for the 541

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:24.050
households who are
basically have not dropped

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:26.180
out sort of a balanced panel.

00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:37.150
Now, about the townships, so
what percentage of households

00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:40.930
have relatives living
in the same village?

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:46.530
It's a bit low into only
half in [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:49.180
It's 3/4 in Logburi.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.300
And Buriram is already up to
the 80s if not to the 90s.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.690
But if you go to
the township level,

00:40:55.690 --> 00:41:00.540
then 87, really 88 is
the lowest percent.

00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.480
In other words,
almost every household

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.280
has a relative if
not in their own

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.620
village then in
a village nearby.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:11.740
So we stopped kind of looking
at networks after this.

00:41:11.740 --> 00:41:16.620
And networks confuse
people, rightly so.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:17.550
Because who's in it?

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:18.520
And who isn't?

00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.560
And is there selection
bias, and so on?

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.860
So we just made it
easy for ourselves

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:25.740
and said, ah, they're all really
related to each other anyway.

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.630
So let's use the whole sample.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:30.570
But I'll show you what
we go back and check.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.660
This looks like risk and
return in village India.

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:39.900
I mean, you can see the
cultivation activities,

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:46.140
livestock, fish, shrimp,
wage earning, and so on.

00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.420
Wage earning is a bit
heavier in the Northeast.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:52.350
And in [INAUDIBLE]
only [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:52.350 --> 00:41:55.395
has fish and shrimp.

00:41:55.395 --> 00:41:57.270
It sounds like a restaurant.

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:58.770
I know I've already
told you though.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:02.400
That's what you're eating
when you buy shrimp at Costco.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:09.070
And all the business,
livestock is pretty heavy.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:14.710
And Logburi, also [INAUDIBLE],,
those are the dairy cattle.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:18.460
So that's just a quick
reminder of the "projects."

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:23.560
My project is a cow, et cetera.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.893
It's a cash cow.

00:42:24.893 --> 00:42:25.560
That's terrible.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:33.770
And here is some just
reminder of descriptive

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:37.610
statistics, males,
females, education levels.

00:42:37.610 --> 00:42:40.820
Some of this you've seen
before, income levels, assets

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.750
and liabilities, and so on.

00:42:47.468 --> 00:42:49.010
So we're going to
use a total return.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:51.260
And we're going to
include financial assets.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:54.620
We're not going to separate--

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.060
by the way, it's
a bit problematic

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.370
to know what to do
with a savings account.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.650
It's a financial asset.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.530
But on the other hand,
maybe like inventory,

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.490
it's kind of contributing
to the business.

00:43:05.490 --> 00:43:08.430
And if we didn't have it in
there, then people would ask.

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:10.290
So it didn't make
much difference.

00:43:10.290 --> 00:43:12.890
So we put in all the
financial assets.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.780
Actually, subtracted
off the debts too.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.460
It doesn't really matter.

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.800
If you want to think about
this as real rates of return,

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:29.740
you would not be misled
in real projects,

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.400
real people, real assets.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:36.680
OK, you know we constructed
these financial accounts.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.030
This is problematic.

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:43.910
We have to sort of subtract
off the cost of labor.

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:48.900
And when it's household
labor, it's not priced.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:52.260
This is probably our
single biggest problem.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.900
And when I show you residual
rates of return in a minute,

00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.540
you'll see some of them are low.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.460
We probably subtracted
off too much.

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:01.810
But it's very hard to know.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:05.870
Because we try to grab
instruments and adjust.

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:11.400
But it's really kind of
not terribly compelling.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:14.690
You'll see this again when
we get to the labor paper.

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.330
So we adjust the income.

00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:20.420
We divide by fixed assets.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.570
That, as you know, is
rate of return on assets.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:24.970
We may get real.

00:44:24.970 --> 00:44:26.745
The data is nominal.

00:44:26.745 --> 00:44:28.370
It's all measured
in Thai [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:35.160
So we deflate by Bank of
Thailand regional price

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:35.660
changes.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:48.690
This is the table of the
rates of return mean standard

00:44:48.690 --> 00:44:50.880
deviation and the so-called--

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:52.230
so I forgot to say it.

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:54.810
But that thing I kept
saying was sort of

00:44:54.810 --> 00:44:57.780
like a coefficient
of variation, that's

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:01.510
like the inverse Sharpe ratio.

00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:03.590
So you can add that
to your vocabulario.

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:15.510
Now, each household
has a sample average.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:18.570
So you're going to have a mean
standard deviation, et cetera,

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:21.990
those statistical moments
for every single household.

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:25.480
So you have a histogram
in the population.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:28.290
So you can look at the
median mean if you want,

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:35.250
if it's not too confusing, or
the 25th and 75th quartiles

00:45:35.250 --> 00:45:36.150
of rates of return.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:49.700
Some of them are high.

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.310
Many of them are not that high.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.180
But in any event, these
are not adjusted at all.

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.895
They're just the
crude rates of return.

00:46:04.460 --> 00:46:07.180
OK, so now we got to decide what
to do with the risk free rate.

00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:13.340
Well, these are
supposed to be real.

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.190
So we're basically
going to assume

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:18.550
they have something
like inventory that

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:20.590
goes up with the price level.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.970
And there's nothing
stochastic about it.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:26.415
So we're going to assume the
real rate of return is zero.

00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:32.460
Now again, if we're
guessing wrong about this,

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:34.710
we're going to be guessing
wrong about the intercepts.

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:39.525
Because everything we do
is subtracting off zero.

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.930
But anyway, that's what we do.

00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:56.230
The market return is the
average township rate of return.

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:59.360
And again, that's just
looking at the income

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:05.480
over all the households
divided by all the assets.

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.770
We're about to run
a regression though.

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:17.177
So we will take out the
household's own contribution

00:47:17.177 --> 00:47:18.135
to the village average.

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:20.770
It's like a leave out mean.

00:47:20.770 --> 00:47:23.540
So we don't you know bias
it in the obvious way.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.960
Yes?

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:29.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.340
PROFESSOR: Depreciation
is in here.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:37.622
Because depreciation is a cost
that we're subtracting off

00:47:37.622 --> 00:47:38.705
in the financial accounts.

00:47:38.705 --> 00:47:40.705
AUDIENCE: So that's where
it comes [INAUDIBLE]??

00:47:40.705 --> 00:47:42.190
PROFESSOR: Uh-huh.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:47.800
So these numbers are basically
coming off of the income

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.120
as in the income statement.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:52.820
And the assets as in
the balance sheet,

00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:54.400
which you've seen before.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.560
Although, it is true that
we cover a lot of ground.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.240
So I'm happy to remind you.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.280
So how do we get
the relationship

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:08.130
of the household's rate of
return to the village average?

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.270
We run a regression.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:13.060
We run a regression
of the household's,

00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:18.230
over all of its projects,
household's return at day t.

00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:21.400
But there are lots of dates
t with all those months--

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.260
more on that in a second--

00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:27.450
regressed against the
village return at day t.

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:29.470
OK, so this beta
is just literally

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:33.950
the regression coefficient
that we wanted conveniently.

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:34.618
Yes?

00:48:34.618 --> 00:48:36.160
AUDIENCE: We are
assuming [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:40.790
is constant over time
for each household?

00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:44.150
PROFESSOR: OK, so yeah,
there's several adjustments.

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:45.600
I think it's on the next page.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.770
But anyway, so actually,
what we're going to do

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:54.060
is do five year increments.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.580
You could just
take one household

00:48:56.580 --> 00:49:01.970
over all the many
years and months

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:05.890
and ignore possible
shifts in their portfolio.

00:49:05.890 --> 00:49:09.490
But like you're saying,
that might be a bad idea.

00:49:09.490 --> 00:49:15.680
So we redid it as
if the household

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.260
had returns on a
portfolio from year one

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.920
through five then returns
on a portfolio from year two

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.290
through six, seven
through eight,

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:25.700
and so on all the way through.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:29.840
And it turns out that
idea, as many others,

00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.995
come from the
finance literature.

00:49:31.995 --> 00:49:33.120
So that's what we're doing.

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:41.020
The other adjustment I should
have mentioned earlier.

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.750
And I didn't.

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.350
But you remember when we
use a quadratic utility

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:49.710
it was a plus b times
something, right?

00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:52.460
And there was no
t on those things.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:56.850
So it was like the
marginal utility of wealth

00:49:56.850 --> 00:49:58.230
just depends on wealth.

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:00.040
And it doesn't depend
on anything else.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:05.070
But in many
intertemporal models,

00:50:05.070 --> 00:50:08.010
those things would
be moving around.

00:50:08.010 --> 00:50:12.480
So I'll tell you about
that adjustment too.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.350
We actually did it all
the different ways.

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:21.810
But these are the key steps.

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.100
We run the regression,
or regressions,

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:25.200
for each household.

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:35.590
And then we get the beta
for each household j.

00:50:35.590 --> 00:50:41.440
And we get the average return,
either over all the years

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:43.610
or over these five
year increments.

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:48.350
And then we run this
regression essentially

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.410
with this already coming from
a previous regression using

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.400
the panel.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.660
This thing is just a
cross-sectional regression.

00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:56.960
There's no time date here.

00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:59.070
This is the average return.

00:50:59.070 --> 00:51:01.340
This is the extent
to which the village

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.520
that household's returns are
correlated with the village

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.530
average.

00:51:08.530 --> 00:51:13.730
And we'll get expressions
for lambda, alpha, and so on.

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:16.370
And there are restrictions.

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:20.310
Although, you no doubt
can't remember seven

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:23.630
and a half slides back
that and this lambda

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:26.150
ought to be equal to something
like the expected market

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:27.810
rate of return.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:30.390
Just take my word for it.

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:31.830
We don't impose
that restriction.

00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:41.500
So here's the first result.
Beta is on the right hand side.

00:51:41.500 --> 00:51:45.070
And it's being regressed against
the household's mean rate

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:51.640
of return and three
of the four provinces.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:55.747
It's quite positive
and significant.

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:04.490
These are the regression
coefficients, the lambdas

00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:05.720
basically.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.830
And this is the
estimated constant.

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:10.870
And r squares.

00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:11.770
You know what it is.

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:13.130
It's kind of worth noting.

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:17.640
Buriram fails and has
a very low r square.

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.540
And Buriram is one
of the places I've

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:24.220
mentioned, where the farmland
got plowed over with roads.

00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:26.650
And the town was being built up.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:30.870
So there arguably were a lot
of changes in occupations.

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:33.240
We'll try to fix that.

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.400
Yes?

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.500
AUDIENCE: Is this for
one five year period?

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:39.690
Or is this like an
average of the--

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:45.420
PROFESSOR: This is actually,
with treating each household

00:52:45.420 --> 00:52:46.825
multiple times.

00:52:46.825 --> 00:52:48.160
AUDIENCE: OK, so--

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:48.990
PROFESSOR: I think.

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.770
Let me just see.

00:52:59.590 --> 00:53:03.027
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] it's
like putting 20 years.

00:53:09.873 --> 00:53:11.040
PROFESSOR: No, it's not yet.

00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.900
AUDIENCE: So that's
like the whole thing.

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.405
PROFESSOR: This is
the whole thing.

00:53:14.405 --> 00:53:17.690
AUDIENCE: So do we have to
worry about [INAUDIBLE] issues

00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:19.976
or [INAUDIBLE] problems with us?

00:53:19.976 --> 00:53:23.174
Or is that not-- do
I misunderstood how

00:53:23.174 --> 00:53:24.410
the regression [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:26.395
So is there some
possibility that there's

00:53:26.395 --> 00:53:30.355
like going to be trends in the
errors that are not picked up?

00:53:30.355 --> 00:53:31.840
Because you set the constant.

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:34.970
[INAUDIBLE] So we don't have
to worry too much about using

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:35.835
the whole--

00:53:35.835 --> 00:53:37.210
PROFESSOR: We
worried quite a bit

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:41.620
about potential econometric
biases and so on and so forth.

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:43.600
Then we went back
and read the classics

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.620
in finance, [INAUDIBLE],,
French, all these guys.

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:49.660
And we're doing
what they're doing.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.470
So we felt better.

00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:56.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:58.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
if we regress

00:53:58.410 --> 00:54:01.270
the errors on the [INAUDIBLE],,
does it pause the test?

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:02.730
Or is it--

00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:03.960
PROFESSOR: Oh, we haven't--

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:09.420
yeah, I don't think we've looked
for autocorrelation and stuff

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:09.920
like that.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] we
get hammered three hours

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.083
and make that [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:15.642
That's what we're
doing [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:15.642 --> 00:54:17.190
PROFESSOR: The HH factor.

00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.630
OK, we'll check that.

00:54:21.630 --> 00:54:22.670
Yes?

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:25.460
AUDIENCE: So do you
think it's worse

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:28.020
to joint tested r [INAUDIBLE]
j for each household,

00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.303
like the finance guys?

00:54:30.303 --> 00:54:32.220
PROFESSOR: We're about
to show you the alphas.

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:32.762
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:32.762 --> 00:54:35.440
PROFESSOR: I haven't
gotten there yet.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.510
We'll see when I get
there whether you have

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:38.710
something different in mind.

00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:50.580
Anyway, so if you
want to visually see

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:54.650
sort of a mean
variance frontier,

00:54:54.650 --> 00:54:56.790
you the beta is down here.

00:54:56.790 --> 00:55:02.280
That's kind of the risk factor,
if you believe this model.

00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.350
And the expected
returns are here.

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:08.660
And you can see a
pretty close fit.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:14.390
Now, this I've shown
to the finance guys

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:15.500
at lunches and things.

00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:18.270
And they're like, wow.

00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:21.890
Because this is
actually pretty good

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:24.245
relative to New York
financial markets.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.540
Oh, it's an easy target, OK.

00:55:33.820 --> 00:55:39.760
So so far we are showing
that just to repeat,

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.990
when someone has a higher
return, it's partly not talent.

00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:49.740
It's just that it's correlated
with the village average.

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:54.560
And it's high because you
need to adjust for the risk.

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:56.900
Now, we can do this at the
village level, in which case

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:58.740
nine of the 16
villages we're going

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:02.450
to have this positive
correlation that the theory

00:56:02.450 --> 00:56:03.450
says ought to be there.

00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:10.170
And when we go to
the network level,

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:13.813
we have five out
of nine networks.

00:56:13.813 --> 00:56:15.480
And I'll show you
about the adjustments,

00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.780
remind you here's
a kinship network.

00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:21.540
206 is married with
207 in some way.

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:24.090
And 214 has all these.

00:56:24.090 --> 00:56:28.650
So can it literally
connect the dots?

00:56:28.650 --> 00:56:31.320
Here's a big dynasty down here.

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.840
Here's a little dynasty there,
another little dynasty there.

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.680
So we went through
all the villages.

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.710
And they had to have
enough data to do this.

00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:48.200
So we ended up with networks.

00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:54.970
Now, some villages have
more than one, et cetera.

00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:58.290
So of the nine with
enough data, we're

00:56:58.290 --> 00:57:01.620
picking up the theory
doing well here and not

00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.780
in some of the other ones.

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:10.040
So as I said, we go micro,
go macro, zooming in and out.

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:15.940
There's a lot of explanation
of the rate of return.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.310
That has to do with
the village average.

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.940
This is villages.

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:29.540
OK, so this has to do with
changing projects, basically.

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:30.590
So it's what I said.

00:57:30.590 --> 00:57:35.720
We use these sort of five
year intervals and redo it.

00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:42.880
And kind of reassuringly,
Buriram pops back in there.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.690
Because Buriram was
the place for sure

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:48.440
that I know that they switched
occupations quite a bit

00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:51.600
and moved from lower to
higher rates of return.

00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:54.770
So it's kind of reassuring,
given the previous work

00:57:54.770 --> 00:58:00.770
to see that this adjustment
allows us to recover something.

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:04.790
Although, the r square
is nothing to brag about.

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:13.570
Now, another hard thing, easy
and hard at the same time,

00:58:13.570 --> 00:58:19.220
is human capital,
not physical capital.

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:22.070
So as you know, a lot of these
households have laborers.

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:24.020
They're earning wages.

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:28.490
And you say, well, what's that
the fruit of what tree is that?

00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:30.785
Well, the tree is human capital.

00:58:30.785 --> 00:58:34.070
Of course, you never
really see that.

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:37.030
You can write big H. And you
have the notation for it.

00:58:37.030 --> 00:58:39.100
But what is it really?

00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:43.037
Unfortunately, we don't need
the measure of their stock.

00:58:43.037 --> 00:58:44.620
All we need to do
is measure the flow.

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.950
So basically, it's
not quite right.

00:58:49.950 --> 00:58:53.850
But largely, the
return on human capital

00:58:53.850 --> 00:58:56.620
are the wages these
households are earning.

00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:59.700
And we will now put that
in the equation as well.

00:59:05.423 --> 00:59:07.673
AUDIENCE: Can I ask you a
question about [INAUDIBLE]??

00:59:07.673 --> 00:59:08.440
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:10.330
AUDIENCE: So the
way I understand

00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:13.092
this is rather than something
like skill and talent,

00:59:13.092 --> 00:59:14.800
you're saying people
[INAUDIBLE] returns,

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.000
because they're somewhere all
along this return frontier.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.040
AUDIENCE: So once we
think of this model,

00:59:21.040 --> 00:59:23.110
like how do we then respond
to the big questions

00:59:23.110 --> 00:59:27.570
of the puzzles of
heterogeneous returns?

00:59:27.570 --> 00:59:28.278
Do we know what--

00:59:28.278 --> 00:59:29.737
PROFESSOR: Well,
we don't know yet.

00:59:29.737 --> 00:59:30.610
I haven't shown you.

00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:33.100
Maybe there's no puzzle.

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.240
That's the point.

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.442
People aren't adjusting.

00:59:37.442 --> 00:59:39.330
AUDIENCE: But there's still--

00:59:39.330 --> 00:59:41.750
PROFESSOR: But anyway, not
to keep you in suspense.

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:44.220
It is going to turn out
that there is a residual.

00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:46.440
And then we can see
what it's related to.

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.220
And I actually said
it's wealthy females who

00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:54.484
have the high residual
rate of return.

00:59:54.484 --> 00:59:56.304
AUDIENCE: So
essentially the question

00:59:56.304 --> 00:59:59.202
is, given that they're on that
[INAUDIBLE] regression line,

00:59:59.202 --> 01:00:00.410
which ones are where and why?

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:03.500
And part of the answer
might be explained by--

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.920
PROFESSOR: Well,
there is part of it

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:11.940
that we're not explaining, even
in the definition of the model,

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.350
in the construction
of the model,

01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:16.670
and another part that's
outside the model altogether.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:19.890
What we're not
doing very well is

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:22.620
why household j is
running project i

01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.240
and some other household is not.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.330
We're just acting like
the social planner knew

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:31.530
and efficiently allocated
projects across households.

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:37.330
So that part is sort of
related to the talent thing.

01:00:37.330 --> 01:00:38.250
But we never see it.

01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:45.360
We can only look at
the residual return,

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.170
which actually ought to be
zero if the model is true.

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:59.030
Anyway, so another adjustment
that I've mentioned

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:02.150
is that a plus bw thing.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:07.560
And you might want to
have time subscript.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.100
Sorry, I'm jumping ahead.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:10.810
Here's the human capital thing.

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:15.840
So now the rate of return has
two factors a la, basically,

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.600
[INAUDIBLE] type thing, OK?

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.308
One is the physical capital.

01:01:20.308 --> 01:01:21.600
And the other is human capital.

01:01:26.260 --> 01:01:31.420
And we can try to
get both betas.

01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:36.760
Another is this problem with
the varying shadow prices.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:43.990
Well, another way to say this
mu, act like mu is a constant.

01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:50.270
Mu t is the value of
resources at day t.

01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:52.880
In the derivation, it was
always today versus tomorrow.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.590
And it kind of got suppressed.

01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:56.810
But suppose a village
has a run of bad luck,

01:01:56.810 --> 01:01:59.450
like [INAUDIBLE],, with those
shrimp ponds going bad.

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:02.240
Then they have less
and less income.

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.970
So you would think
mu t is going up.

01:02:04.970 --> 01:02:09.480
Because the marginal value,
the shadow price is going up.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.840
So we really do need
to adjust for that.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.970
But there again,
there's a way to do it.

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:22.600
It turns out that time
varying stochastic discount

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:27.900
factor is related to the
consumption wealth ratio.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:31.740
And in turn, the law
consumption wealth ratio

01:02:31.740 --> 01:02:37.840
depends on three factors,
consumption, physical wealth,

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:41.135
and basically, labor earnings.

01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.830
Rather than getting bogged
down in the details,

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:50.470
I think intuitively
you could just think,

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:52.400
well, you know, there's
physical capital.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:58.210
So basically, the
consumption wealth ratio

01:02:58.210 --> 01:03:02.500
is kind of picking up the
degree to which they have wealth

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.760
today relative to consumption.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.790
So that's kind of like
an obvious argument

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:11.200
to have in today's shadow price.

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.280
And these things that
determine the consumption

01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:16.960
wealth, or the law consumption
wealth ratio, kind of look

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.460
like the accounting variables
that we've had before.

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:24.100
You know, how much you eating?

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.700
Again, how much is your
physical capital today?

01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:32.360
And then how much is
your labor earnings?

01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:34.780
So that's kind of
the spirit of it.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:40.280
Again, do our homework and we
can find this exact derivation

01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.360
in the literature.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.360
So this consumption asset
ratio just looks like this.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.460
So we find that in the
data by regressing it

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:53.550
on to the arguments
that I just mentioned,

01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:55.540
consumption and so on.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:04:00.520
And then we substitute
in that estimated value

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:06.100
into the regression that already
was adjusted for human capital.

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:07.930
So now we just did
a double adjustment.

01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:11.470
We put human capital in the
rate of return on human capital.

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:13.660
And now we have
extra data terms that

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:19.090
have to do with the covariance
of those physical and human

01:04:19.090 --> 01:04:22.700
capital returns with this.

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:24.940
So basically, we're
just interacting.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:26.140
We have levels of things.

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:29.840
And then we're interacting
it with the rates of return.

01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:30.710
So we do that.

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:31.600
We end up with this.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.100
It's a longer equation.

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:34.870
And we run it.

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:40.450
And we're still getting the
beta on physical capital.

01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:42.730
It's quite hardy.

01:04:42.730 --> 01:04:43.495
It's quite robust.

01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:51.610
Human capital is in there
sometimes, sometimes not.

01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:54.170
But at least putting it
in doesn't harm this.

01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:56.720
In other words, as I said,
we do all the adjustments

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.350
that we can.

01:04:57.350 --> 01:05:01.820
And we're still getting
the basic result back out.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.760
Now, you want to
know about risk?

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.490
Well, this is the equation
that we're running.

01:05:12.490 --> 01:05:15.380
So you can do a
decomposition of variance.

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:18.880
The total variance in
returns is just the variance

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:23.260
having to do with the
regression times the variant,

01:05:23.260 --> 01:05:24.640
or basically, this thing.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.070
This is the contribution
of market risk

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:30.460
to the variance of household j.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:36.620
And there's a residual here that
we were just chatting about.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:39.980
So we estimate its variance.

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:43.280
And so that's the contribution
of idiosyncratic risk

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:45.245
to the overall variance.

01:05:45.245 --> 01:05:48.530
So now, we have this
measure, finally.

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:52.100
But note that it didn't just
come from using the data.

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:54.590
We used the structure of
the model to back it out.

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:09.180
And that idiosyncratic part
is large, at least half

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.590
and in many instances.

01:06:11.590 --> 01:06:14.200
Substantially more
than half of the risk

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:17.110
is due to the idiosyncratic
component, rather than

01:06:17.110 --> 01:06:17.970
the aggregate.

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:20.360
Now, one word of caution.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.230
We still haven't
rejected the model.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:27.490
No one in finance says there
aren't idiosyncratic returns.

01:06:27.490 --> 01:06:29.800
The question is
whether they're priced.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:33.850
If you believe in the capital
asset model or the consumption

01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:38.350
based risk sharing model,
then idiosyncratic returns

01:06:38.350 --> 01:06:38.860
can exist.

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.120
But they're completely pooled.

01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:45.710
So this per se does
not reject the model.

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:51.500
But when we now
stick the variance,

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:57.060
sigma j, into the
benchmark model.

01:06:57.060 --> 01:07:02.210
And we're still doing
OK with aggregate risk.

01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:04.110
But here's the
rejection, if you like.

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:07.260
The idiosyncratic
risk is positively

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:09.590
associated with
expected rate of return

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:12.370
and for all the households.

01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:19.450
Now, this is the if you
like, the disappointing part,

01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:22.390
or the tension, which
is you go to all

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:25.030
this work with a benchmark.

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:26.710
And it seems to be
doing really well.

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:32.380
But there are features
of the data against which

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:33.400
it's not doing well.

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:41.620
So it's clear that it's not
an entirely perfect markets

01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.860
world from the point of
view of the rate of return

01:07:44.860 --> 01:07:47.470
of these assets.

01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:49.570
But is the glass half
empty or half full?

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:53.080
Because it's also true
that a substantial amount

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.600
of the rates of return had
to do with market risk.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:58.590
And most development
researchers would

01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:00.030
have ignored that market part.

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:02.820
I think it's fair to
say, even though it's

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.160
kind of a natural
corollary to risk sharing.

01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:21.099
So let's go back
to these alphas.

01:08:26.029 --> 01:08:29.290
So Jensen talks about having
portfolio managers who

01:08:29.290 --> 01:08:32.630
are somehow smarter
or better than others.

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:34.665
And they have abnormal returns.

01:08:34.665 --> 01:08:35.540
I mean, I don't know.

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.359
This is kind of
hard for economists.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:42.380
It's like, well, if you do
so well, why don't everyone

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:43.580
just go in there?

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.590
Like, I never make money.

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:47.960
I don't trust my instincts.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:54.890
But I'll tell you
story about Walmart.

01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:59.330
So one of my colleagues who
was at Chicago, a sociologist,

01:08:59.330 --> 01:09:00.450
was in Arkansas.

01:09:00.450 --> 01:09:06.420
And he saw this big square flat
building in northern Arkansas.

01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:09.029
And he sort of checked
it out and said,

01:09:09.029 --> 01:09:11.470
well, this is a really
novel way of doing business.

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:14.175
Well, it turned out to be
practically the first branch

01:09:14.175 --> 01:09:14.675
of Walmart.

01:09:14.675 --> 01:09:15.769
And he bought stock.

01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:22.069
He did quite well obviously.

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:24.952
Anyway, so maybe some
portfolio managers

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:25.910
are better than others.

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:30.300
Maybe some households are
somehow better than others.

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:39.080
And we've now got a way of
adjusting for all those risk

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:44.270
factors, both the idiosyncratic
and the aggregate.

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:46.970
By the way, you will
be relieved a bit

01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:49.910
maybe to know that
when we rank order

01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:52.490
the households by the
unadjusted rates of return

01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:54.680
and the risk adjusted
rates of return,

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.280
the ordering is
largely preserved.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.590
But the orders of
magnitude are not.

01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:03.140
The second point is
it's not just completely

01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:06.920
downshifting the distribution
after you subtract stuff off.

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.180
The tails come in.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.760
So it has a different
level of skewness.

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:14.840
So it's kind of a serious
filter on the data.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:19.820
But some of the earlier
results that poor households

01:10:19.820 --> 01:10:22.775
have high rates of return and
reinvest in their own projects,

01:10:22.775 --> 01:10:23.900
we're going to rerun those.

01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:28.130
But we're pretty confident those
kind of results don't go away.

01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:30.665
And I haven't misled you
in the earlier lectures.

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:39.690
So finally, here is running
these regressions, where

01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:43.950
we have aggregate risk,
also allow idiosyncratic

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:51.120
risk, where we have the betas
on aggregate physical capital

01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:53.560
and the coefficients on sigma.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:11:04.050
So the first two slides I
said households who are older

01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:06.420
take on less risk,
which means basically,

01:11:06.420 --> 01:11:08.550
both the idiosyncratic
and aggregate risk

01:11:08.550 --> 01:11:11.050
factors are negative.

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:15.990
You might be willing to tell
a demographic story for that.

01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:18.130
We don't really have it
embedded in the model.

01:11:18.130 --> 01:11:23.750
It's more like a residual or
behavioral thing at this point.

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:27.740
Because these residuals
aren't supposed to be there.

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:32.950
And here is basically the
wealth again, negative.

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:40.450
So poor people have higher
correlation of their activities

01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:42.650
with a village average.

01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:45.215
And the residual have a
higher residual variance.

01:11:47.765 --> 01:11:49.990
I'm going to come back to that.

01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:52.350
Poor people seem to be
exposed to a lot of risk.

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:04.470
However, if you take out both
sources of risk and regress

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.260
on demographics and
all these things,

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.050
wealth finally goes positive.

01:12:10.050 --> 01:12:17.970
And also, this is a dummy for
male, so to speak, is negative.

01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:22.590
So that the female headed
households and the high wealth

01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:25.950
households are the households
with the highest sort

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:27.380
of residual rates of return.

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:40.350
OK, so now what I don't have
in front of me unfortunately,

01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:42.750
we didn't quite
get close enough.

01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:45.960
But you may remember that
QJE paper from lecture one

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:50.250
on volatility, growth,
finance, what's related?

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:52.860
And we said, well, we've
got to look at sectors.

01:12:52.860 --> 01:12:55.710
We've got to figure out how
much each sector is contributing

01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:59.280
to overall change
in value added.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.460
And there was some really
cool decomposition.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:05.650
So we're running that
on these Thai data.

01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:12.430
So we can see at
the level of income

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:14.420
how diversified are
these households?

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:20.390
It's similar, but not identical
to this CAPM type approach.

01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:22.930
And so far at least, we're
getting the same answer,

01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:28.330
that it's the relatively poor
households who are specialized.

01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:30.090
And the things
they specialize in

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:38.300
have high volatility, and so on.

01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:41.360
So poor people seem
to be exposed to risk

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.740
at least on the income side.

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:57.560
So here's moving to Sweden,
more sort of standard asset

01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:02.310
stuff, which John
Campbell and co-authors

01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:05.580
have done called Down or Out.

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:11.780
And what they're trying
to do is very similar.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:15.170
They're trying to look
at household management

01:14:15.170 --> 01:14:18.890
of financial affairs
using measurement

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:22.760
in this amazing Swedish data.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:25.580
Sweden is a socialist
country largely.

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:27.080
And they measure everything.

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.160
And everyone has a common
ID, and your whole portfolio,

01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:32.810
labor supply, everything.

01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:38.720
So I've been
collaborating a little bit

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:45.190
with a Riksbank largely
influenced by this paper.

01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:48.550
Now unfortunately, it takes
us away from development.

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:49.690
That's not my point.

01:14:49.690 --> 01:14:51.680
My point is the commonality.

01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.680
They're going to look at
mean variance frontiers

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.080
and see what
households are doing.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:59.770
In particular, what are the poor
people doing or the rich ones?

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.790
The focus is a bit
different, which is

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:07.560
households can make mistakes.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:13.400
In other words, let's just
assume the model is right.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.680
And the mean
variance frontier is

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:19.460
what it is and then see
households in the interior who

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:21.538
could get less variance
or a higher mean

01:15:21.538 --> 01:15:22.955
if they only move
to the frontier.

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.450
And then they look
by characteristics,

01:15:27.450 --> 01:15:29.340
like education,
wealth, and so on

01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:35.130
to see who is
under diversified--

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:37.480
those are the down people--

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:40.360
and who's not participating
as in the stock market.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.840
Those are the out people.

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:47.190
And hence the title, very
clever, Down and Out.

01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:51.820
And they measure the welfare
costs of those deviations.

01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:53.450
As I said, they
have amazing data.

01:15:53.450 --> 01:15:59.440
And here you can see sort of how
households manage their growth

01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:01.720
wealth in Sweden.

01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:03.160
This is the cash.

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:03.910
Oh, look at that.

01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:07.780
Poor people have a lot of cash.

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.000
I think cash just doesn't
mean Swedish krona.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:13.035
I think it also
means bank accounts.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.980
But stocks, poor people
don't hold stocks.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.350
Mutual fund has this
funny hunch-- now,

01:16:26.350 --> 01:16:29.860
it's interesting that
this is real estate.

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:33.430
So this is both financial
as well as real.

01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:37.340
And on a household side,
there are some businesses here

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:37.840
actually.

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:43.520
But most of these households
are salary employees.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.660
But they can hold
durable goods in housing.

01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:50.750
If you take the physical
housing wealth out of it,

01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:52.895
then the cash thing
is still going down.

01:16:56.290 --> 01:16:59.410
The mutual funds is largely
flat, except at the very low

01:16:59.410 --> 01:17:00.160
and the high end.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:02.380
And then you see this stock.

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:08.880
It's the 90 percentile
up are the people who

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.690
have reasonably substantial
holdings in the stocks.

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:17.650
I ask myself these
questions a lot in Thailand.

01:17:17.650 --> 01:17:21.960
Sort of maybe they
shouldn't be investing

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:22.890
in their own projects.

01:17:22.890 --> 01:17:27.510
Maybe they should be investing
in Bangkok money market

01:17:27.510 --> 01:17:31.520
funds, safe funds.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:33.950
We should be sort of looking
at the whole mean variance

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:36.100
frontier for these.

01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.420
And we are asking them now.

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:38.605
We're actively involved.

01:17:38.605 --> 01:17:41.150
I was on the phone
again last night.

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:45.800
We're about to be asking them
a bunch of questions about,

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:47.370
are they aware of other assets?

01:17:50.150 --> 01:17:53.540
But in Sweden the point that
Campbell is going to make

01:17:53.540 --> 01:18:02.180
is you've got those categories.

01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:06.050
And households can make mistakes
by picking volatile assets,

01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:09.380
holding a concentrated
portfolio, picking correlated.

01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:11.930
See the parallel here
with what I was saying

01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:17.630
happens in the Thai villages in
terms of relatively poor people

01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:19.910
not being diversified
and for some reason

01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:20.960
doing riskier things.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:26.080
Or if you go in
the stock market,

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.035
you could pick your own stocks.

01:18:28.035 --> 01:18:30.400
It's not a particularly
clever thing to do.

01:18:34.210 --> 01:18:36.280
And this is the picture
that makes the paper.

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:42.960
So here's the sort
of mean variance

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:46.140
frontier, standard
deviation in means.

01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:49.630
Here's where they ought to be.

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:52.210
Adjusting or not for
international asset holdings,

01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:52.840
that's another.

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.790
They do both.

01:18:54.790 --> 01:19:01.880
But they're basically saying,
small guys in some sense

01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:03.950
are unsophisticated
and cautious.

01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:05.720
They're pretty far
off the frontier.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.320
But they don't have
kind of a lot to lose.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:17.390
And these richer guys up here,
they're more sophisticated.

01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:20.840
Their line is quote unquote
above this brown one.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.190
But their gap is huge.

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:25.330
So I'll spare you the details.

01:19:25.330 --> 01:19:27.350
They're actually measuring
the welfare loss.

01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:30.050
And some of these
richer households are--

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:33.410
because they are not
diversifying-- actually

01:19:33.410 --> 01:19:36.740
have fairly substantial
welfare losses.

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:42.020
Now, John goes behavioral in
this and maybe rightly so.

01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:47.270
He's saying should we really
be telling households in Brazil

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:50.450
about investing in
whatever is [INAUDIBLE]..

01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:53.480
I can't remember the acronym.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:55.010
Or are they going
to make mistakes

01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:57.500
and they're better
off not knowing?

01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.430
There was a question.

01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:00.430
AUDIENCE: This is already
answered by the model,

01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:02.830
but this is welfare.

01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:05.510
This takes into account the
marginal utility of wealth.

01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:07.790
PROFESSOR: Yeah, actually,
I'm sparing you a lot.

01:20:07.790 --> 01:20:08.570
Oh, I should say.

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:10.617
This is on the reading list.

01:20:10.617 --> 01:20:12.200
But I knew I wasn't
going to have time

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.820
to cover it in much detail.

01:20:13.820 --> 01:20:16.070
So I picked like six slides.

01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:19.160
But I'll post the whole paper.

01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:21.200
If you're interested,
you don't necessarily

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.975
want to or have time to
read the whole paper.

01:20:23.975 --> 01:20:25.850
You might as well look
at these lecture notes

01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:28.110
that I created previously.

01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:32.200
And the same thing
for this paper,

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:36.220
which is [INAUDIBLE] with
[INAUDIBLE],, Dynamic Risk

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:36.720
Management.

01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:38.160
I've only got a few slides.

01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.630
I think I'm going to jump
and show you something.

01:20:43.210 --> 01:20:44.190
Fly Southwest.

01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:48.630
So this guy's
loading that airplane

01:20:48.630 --> 01:20:51.720
that capital stock up with
this variable input, the fuel.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.290
They buy forward positions.

01:20:58.290 --> 01:21:02.480
Because the price of
gasoline moves around a lot.

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.710
So they basically
buy forward, OK?

01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:11.640
They commit now to buy gasoline
at a pegged future price.

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.150
Now, what happens if the spot
price is lower than that?

01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:16.010
It's like, oh, darn.

01:21:16.010 --> 01:21:17.870
We should've waited.

01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:19.910
Actually, you could
renege on that contract.

01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:24.690
And so what do they
do with those things?

01:21:24.690 --> 01:21:30.950
You've got to post collateral
against these forward gasoline

01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:31.450
hedges.

01:21:34.190 --> 01:21:36.210
Where are we going with this?

01:21:36.210 --> 01:21:40.490
We're going to get to sort
of thinking about something

01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:47.100
that Chris [INAUDIBLE] was
doing in Ghana, which is,

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:55.370
do you want to use your scarce
collateral to borrow and get

01:21:55.370 --> 01:22:00.290
more aircraft with potentially
high rate of return?

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:02.480
Or do you want to use
your scarce collateral

01:22:02.480 --> 01:22:05.750
and tie it up hedging
against future states

01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:08.260
of the world s prime?

01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:13.260
And this paper is about how in
practice this may not happen.

01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:15.280
Now, when does it happen?

01:22:19.900 --> 01:22:21.690
Where is it?

01:22:21.690 --> 01:22:26.320
It happens when the airline
isn't doing very well.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:32.110
So if you think about relatively
poor households, it's like, oh,

01:22:32.110 --> 01:22:32.980
they're behavioral.

01:22:32.980 --> 01:22:35.270
They're not buying insurance.

01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:36.450
What's wrong with them?

01:22:36.450 --> 01:22:37.330
They need it most.

01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:40.260
They've got the
most marginal value.

01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.340
Well, no, not necessarily.

01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:45.320
They may have better use
for their existing wealth.

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:49.810
So we're getting again, very
explicitly now into obstacles.

01:22:49.810 --> 01:22:53.050
So when you start writing
down models with obstacles

01:22:53.050 --> 01:22:56.230
and barriers to
trade, you can get

01:22:56.230 --> 01:23:00.040
at this issue about
borrowing to finance

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.110
projects versus borrowing.

01:23:02.110 --> 01:23:05.620
So maybe it's still possible
that those relatively poor

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:07.810
people who seem to be
doing really risky things

01:23:07.810 --> 01:23:09.940
and aren't hedged
against it, maybe

01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:12.840
there's a reason for that.

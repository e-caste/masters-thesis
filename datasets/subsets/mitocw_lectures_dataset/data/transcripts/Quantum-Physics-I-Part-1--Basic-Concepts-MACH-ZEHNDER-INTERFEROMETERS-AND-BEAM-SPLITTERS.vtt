00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.792
PROFESSOR: Mach-Zehnder--

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.180
interferometers.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.480
And we have a beam splitter.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.745
And the beam coming
in, it splits into 2.

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:24.714
A mirror--

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.580
another mirror.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.500
The beams are recombined
into another beam splitter.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.380
And then, 2 beams come out.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.150
One to a detector d0--

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.200
and a detector d1.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.500
We could put here any kind
of devices in between.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.420
We could put a little
piece of glass,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.630
which is a phase shifter.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.300
We'll discuss it later.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.650
But our story is a
story of a photon

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.650
coming in and somehow leaving
through the interferometer.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.210
And we want to describe this
photon in quantum mechanics.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.810
And we know that the
way to describe it

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.040
is through a wave function.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.060
But this photon can live
in either of 2 beams.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.360
If a photon was
in 1 beam, I could

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.220
have a number that tells me the
probability to be in that beam.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.310
But now, it can be
in either of 2 beams.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.430
Therefore, I will
use two numbers.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.900
And it seems reasonable to
put them in a column vector.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.340
Two complex numbers that give
me the probability amplitudes--

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.320
for this photon to be somewhere.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.400
So you could say, oh, look here.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.570
What is the probability that
we'll find this photon over

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.070
here?

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.749
Well, it may depend on the time.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.540
I mean, when the photon
is gone, it's gone.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.110
But when it's crossing here,
what is the probability?

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.400
And I have 2 numbers.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.419
What is the probability
here, here, here, here?

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.560
And in fact, you could
even have 1 photon

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.840
that is coming in through 2
different channels, as well.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.410
So I have 2 numbers.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.620
And I want, now, to do
things in a normalized way.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.170
So this will be the probability
amplitude to be here.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.250
This is the probability
amplitude to be down.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.800
And therefore, the probability
to be in the upper one--

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.910
you do norm squared.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.460
The probability to
be in the bottom one,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.440
you do norm squared.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.360
And you get 1.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.370
Must get 1.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.480
So if you write 2 numbers,
they better satisfy that thing.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.900
Otherwise, you are not
describing probabilities.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.170
On the other hand, I may have
a state that is like this.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.710
Alpha-- oh, I'll
mention other states.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:14.470
State 1-0 is a photon
in the upper beam.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.200
No probability to be
in the lower beam.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.150
And state 0-1 is a
photon in the lower beam.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.070
So these are states.

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.642
And indeed--

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.930
think of superposition.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.360
And we have that the
state, alpha beta--

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.380
you know how to
manipulate vectors--

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.970
can be written as alpha 1-0.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.010
Because the number goes
in and becomes alpha 0.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:01.635
Plus beta 0-1.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.330
So the state, alpha
beta, is a superposition

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.250
with coefficient alpha of
the state in the upper beam

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.020
plus the superposition
with coefficient beta

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:18.000
of the state in the lower beam.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.430
We also had this
little device, which

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.860
is called the beam
shifter of face delta.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.660
If the probability
amplitude completing

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.840
is alpha to the left
of it, it's alpha

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.160
e to the i delta to the right
of it, with delta a real number.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.600
So this is a pure phase.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.720
And notice that alpha is
equal to e to the i delta.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.900
The norm of a complex
number doesn't change when

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.370
you multiply it by a phase.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.860
The norm of a complex
number times a phase

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.360
is the norm of
the complex number

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.220
times the norm of the phase.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.000
And the norm of any phase is 1.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.180
So actually, this doesn't
absorb the photon,

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.270
doesn't generate more photons.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.540
It preserves the probability
of having a photon there,

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.920
but it changes the phase.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:20.090
How does the beam
splitter work, however?

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.530
This is the first thing
we have to model here.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.795
So here is the beam splitter.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.950
And you could have
a beam coming--

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:34.490
A 1-0 beam hitting it.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.900
So nothing coming from below.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.270
And something coming from above.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.270
And then, it would reflect
some and transmit some.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.000
And here is a 1--

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.920
is the 1 of the 1-0.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.290
And here's an s and a t.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.990
Which is to mean that this beam
splitter takes the 1-0 photon

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.780
and makes it into an st photon.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.150
Because it produces a
beam with s up and t down.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.690
On the other hand, that
same beam splitter-- now,

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.290
we don't know what those
numbers s and t are.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.690
That's part of designing
a beam splitter.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:22.170
You can ask the
engineer what are s

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.300
and t for the beam splitter.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.930
But we are going to figure
out what are the constraints.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.060
Because no engineer would be
able to make a beam splitter

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.970
with arbitrary s and t.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.470
In particular, you
already see that if 1-0--

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.590
if a photon comes in,
probability conservation,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.030
there must still be a photon.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:53.120
You need that s squared
plus t squared is equal to 1

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.490
because that's a photon state.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.750
Now, you may also have a
photon coming from below

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.580
and giving you uv.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:06.510
So this would be a 0-1
photon, giving you uv.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.945
And therefore, we
would say that 0-1--

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.040
gives you uv.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.250
And you would have u plus v
norm squared is equal to 1.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:25.760
So we need,
apparently, 4 numbers

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.910
to characterize
the beam splitter.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.120
And let's see how
we can do that.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:40.720
Well, why do we need,
really, 4 numbers?

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.370
Because of linearity.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:47.920
So let's explore that
a little more clearly.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.395
And suppose that I ask you,
what happens to an alpha beta

00:07:54.395 --> 00:07:54.895
state--

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:02.440
alpha beta state if it
enters a beam splitter?

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.230
What comes out?

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:09.310
Well, the alpha beta
state, as you know,

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:14.680
is alpha 1-0 plus beta 0-1.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.220
And now, we can use our rules.

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.460
Well, this state, the beam
splitter is a linear device.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.100
So it will give you alpha times
what it makes out of the 1-0.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.712
But out of the 1-0 gives you st.

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:40.530
And the beta times 0-1
will give you beta uv.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:46.110
So this is alpha s plus
beta u times alpha t

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:55.340
plus beta v. And I can write
this, actually, as alpha beta

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:01.260
times the matrix, s u t v.

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:06.030
And you get a very nice thing,
that the effect of the beam

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.110
splitter on any photon
state, alpha beta,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:16.410
is to multiply it by
this matrix, s u t v.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.140
So this is the beam splitter.

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.900
The beam splitter acts
on any photon state.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.770
And out comes the matrix
times the photon state.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.700
This is matrix action,
something that is going

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.520
to be pretty important for us.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.010
How do we get those numbers?

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.460
After all, the beam
splitter is now

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.890
determined by these
4 numbers and we

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.240
don't have enough information.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:52.640
So the manufacturer can tell
you that maybe you've got--

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.030
you bought a balanced
beam splitter.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:10:00.020
Which means that if you have
a beam, half of the intensity

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.140
goes through, half of the
intensity gets reflected.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:05.180
That's a balanced beam splitter.

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.580
That simplifies things
because the intensity

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:10.540
here, the probability,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.940
must be the same as that.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.590
So each norm squared
must be equal to 1/2,

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.170
if you have a balanced--

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:20.615
beam splitter.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:29.250
And you have s squared equal
t squared equal u squared

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.640
equal v squared equal 1/2.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:41.220
But that's still far from enough
to determine s, t, u, and v. So

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:45.420
rather than determining,
them at this moment,

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:46.780
might as well do a guess.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:52.240
So can it be that the
beam splitter matrix--

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.800
Could it be that the
beam splitter matrix

00:10:55.800 --> 00:11:00.740
is 1 over square root of
2, 1 over square root of 2,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:05.100
1 over the square root of 2,
and 1 over square root of 2.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:10.010
That certainly satisfies
all of the properties

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:10.885
we've written before.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.720
Now, why could it be wrong?

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.130
Because it could be pluses
or minuses or it could be i's

00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:21.750
or anything there.

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:24.630
But maybe this is right.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:31.980
Well, if it is right, the
condition that it be right

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.480
is that, if you take a
photon state, 1 photon--

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.450
after the beam splitter,
you still have 1 photon.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.280
So conservation of probability.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.730
So if you act on a
normalized photon

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:48.000
state that satisfies this
alpha squared plus beta squared

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.710
equal 1, it should still give
you a normalized photon state.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.400
And it should do
it for any state.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.560
And presumably, if you get
any numbers that satisfy that,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.830
some engineer will be able
to build that beam splitter

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.590
for you because it
doesn't contradict

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:09.650
any physical principle.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:15.500
So let's try acting on
this with on this state--

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.620
1 over square root of 2,
1 over square root of 2.

00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:24.400
Let's see.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.980
This is normalized--
1/2 plus 1/2 is 1.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:30.530
So I multiply.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:35.480
I get 1/2 plus 1/2 is 1, and 1.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:37.910
Sorry, this is not normalized.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.390
1 squared plus 1
squared is 2, not 1.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.050
So this can't be
a beam splitter.

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.680
No way.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:57.870
We try minus 1 over
square root of 2.

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:02.080
Actually, if you try this for
a few examples, it will work.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.690
So how about if we
tried in general.

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:10.390
So if I try it in general,
acting on alpha beta,

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.330
I would get 1 over square root
of 2 alpha plus beta and alpha

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.380
minus beta.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.780
Then, I would check
the normalization.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.420
So I must do norm
of this 1 squared.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.530
So it's 1/2 alpha
plus beta squared

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.805
plus 1/2 alpha minus
beta norm squared.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.860
Well, what is this?

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.880
Let me go a little
slow for a second.

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.330
[INAUDIBLE] plus beta star.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.100
Plus alpha minus beta.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.770
Alpha star minus beta star.

00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:00.370
Well, the cross terms vanish.

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:04.010
And alpha alpha star, alpha
alpha star, beta beta star,

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.890
beta beta star add.

00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.870
So you do get alpha
squared plus beta squared.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.150
And that's 1 by
assumption because you

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:14.680
started with a photon.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.730
So this works.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.205
This is a good beam
splitter matrix.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:24.820
It does the job.

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:27.122
So actually--

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.890
Consider this beam splitters.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.840
Actually, it's not the
unique solution by all means.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:46.820
But we can have 2 beam splitter
that differ a little bit.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:51.570
So I'll call beam splitter
1 and beam splitter 2.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:57.930
Beam splitter or 1
will have this matrix.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:02.760
And beam splitter 2 will have
the matrix were found here,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.200
which is a 1 1 1 minus 1.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.970
So both of them work, actually.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:11.830
And both of them are
good beam splitters.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.305
I call this--

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.030
beam splitter 1.

00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:22.700
And this, beam splitter 2.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.350
And we'll keep that.

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:29.040
And so we're ready, now, to
think about our experiments

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:32.540
with the beam splitter.

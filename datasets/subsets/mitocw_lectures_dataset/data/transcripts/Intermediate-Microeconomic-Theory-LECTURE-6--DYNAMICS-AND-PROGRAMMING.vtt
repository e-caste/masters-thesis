00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.940 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: OK,
we'll get started on time.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.640 align:middle line:84%
If you look at the
reading list and scroll

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.560 align:middle line:84%
down to where we are, which
is Dynamics and Programming,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.200 align:middle line:90%
you'll see Lecture 6 there.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.270 align:middle line:84%
There's a chapter on Varians,
which is starred, called Time.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.070 align:middle line:84%
That's because the
application today

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.070 align:middle line:84%
will be featuring
dynamics and what

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.910 align:middle line:90%
happens over various dates.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do it
in the context of a storage

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.230 align:middle line:84%
problem, where people were
close to starving to death, as

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.400 align:middle line:90%
in the medieval villages.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.410 align:middle line:84%
And that is Chapter
3 of "Medville."

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.640 align:middle line:84%
It's also starred, which
fills out even more

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.000 align:middle line:84%
than I'm able to in one CLASS
the material for the lecture

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.880 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.200 align:middle line:90%
So that's the reading list.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.630 align:middle line:90%
Then there's study guide.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.150 align:middle line:84%
So I went back
and earmarked what

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.010 align:middle line:84%
we did last time,
which was Decision

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.380 align:middle line:84%
Making under Uncertainty,
Linear Programming.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.030 align:middle line:84%
Some of these
questions are worded

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.430 align:middle line:90%
as if you were doing it at home.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.850 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, the question
asks about important concepts.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.340 align:middle line:90%
So let me read the first one.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Draw a consumption
set which consists

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.210 align:middle line:84%
of discrete number of points
argue that th set is not convex

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.720 align:middle line:84%
and then show how
lotteries which put mass

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.620 align:middle line:84%
on these discrete points,
transforms the consumption set

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.780 align:middle line:90%
into something convex.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.160 align:middle line:84%
So there's two sentences there,
effectively two questions.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.890 align:middle line:90%
Could I get a volunteer, please?

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.770 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.190 align:middle line:90%
So you can't actually draw it.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.260 align:middle line:84%
Can you describe
a consumption set?

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.770 align:middle line:90%
Maybe these words suffice.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.590 align:middle line:84%
Try to describe, in words,
a consumption set which

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.390 align:middle line:84%
contains a discrete
number of points

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.790 align:middle line:90%
and tell me why it's not convex.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.980 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.190 align:middle line:84%
So I think we
discussed this earlier.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.590 align:middle line:84%
But one consumption
set was consuming lunch

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.860 align:middle line:84%
in New York at noon
versus consuming lunch

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.930 align:middle line:90%
in Washington, DC at noon.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.190 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's true.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.440 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So that would be
a discrete consumption set.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.050 align:middle line:84%
And since you
can't consume lunch

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.540 align:middle line:84%
in a mixture of
those two cities,

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.000 align:middle line:84%
then the consumption
is not convex.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.880 align:middle line:84%
But if you had a sum
probability of eating lunch

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.390 align:middle line:84%
in either location, then
you could have a probability

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.240 align:middle line:90%
between zero and one.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.480 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: And
how would you draw it?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.038 align:middle line:90%


00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:50.330 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So for the original
discrete consumption set,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.360 align:middle line:90%
you'd just be two points.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.160 align:middle line:84%
I think one of those
points would be one,

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.160 align:middle line:84%
zero and one of those
points will be zero, one.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.680 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Good.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.300 align:middle line:90%
And can you imagine how--

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.320 align:middle line:84%
I'll help in a second
if it's not clear--

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.600 align:middle line:84%
can you imagine how you
would be able to convert

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.760 align:middle line:84%
that set into something that
is convex, using the lottery?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.972 align:middle line:84%
Is there something you
could draw to depict it?

00:03:15.972 --> 00:03:18.430 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If you just sort of
drew a line between those two

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
points, like your
location, instead

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.030 align:middle line:84%
of doing how many lunches
you eat at DC and New York,

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.960 align:middle line:84%
you could do the probability
that you eat at DC or New York.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.700 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Exactly.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.870 align:middle line:84%
So now we have a line
running on the diagonal

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.510 align:middle line:90%
from one, zero to zero one.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.410 align:middle line:90%
The end points are still there.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.350 align:middle line:84%
Those are lotteries
that are degenerate.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
They're putting probability
one on each of the endpoints.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.360 align:middle line:84%
An intermediate lottery, a
non-trivial lottery, say,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.410 align:middle line:84%
halfway between, would
put probability 1/2 on--

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.880 align:middle line:84%
would be distance 1/2 to
one, zero and distance 1/4

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.710 align:middle line:90%
to zero, one.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:03.630 align:middle line:84%
And that represents an
equal weighted probability.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.810 align:middle line:84%
And you can inch closer to
one endpoint or the other.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.990 align:middle line:84%
Those are still
non-degenerate lotteries.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.330 align:middle line:84%
So a lottery, when you
put a point in there,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.589 align:middle line:90%
represents the weights.

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.339 align:middle line:84%
But yes, your
answer was perfect.

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:21.310 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.315 align:middle line:90%
Questions about that?

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:25.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.170 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.340 align:middle line:84%
What does risk aversion imply
about the consumer's utility

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.800 align:middle line:90%
function?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.470 align:middle line:90%
Again, I'll take volunteers.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If you're
risk averse, then you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.610 align:middle line:84%
have diminishing marginal
utility of income.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.220 align:middle line:84%
So the utility function
should be concave.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.490 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Good.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.555 align:middle line:90%
Strictly or weakly?

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:52.810 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.300 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Convex?

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.710 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Let me repeat.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.890 align:middle line:84%
The question says what
does risk aversion imply

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.080 align:middle line:84%
about the consumer's
utility function.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.810 align:middle line:90%
So your answer, concave, yes.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.290 align:middle line:84%
And I'm asking back, you
mean strictly concave,

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.450 align:middle line:90%
weakly concave.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.390 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I mean, I think it
would be weakly concave, right?

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.510 align:middle line:84%
Because if you have
a straight line--

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.120 align:middle line:84%
or actually would that still
be considered risk averse,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
if your utility from
getting a certain value

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:29.270 align:middle line:84%
is like completely equal
to the utility of having

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.920 align:middle line:90%
that as your expected value?

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.340 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: All right.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.000 align:middle line:90%
That's perfect.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.030 align:middle line:90%
You figured it out.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.320 align:middle line:84%
So the answer is we typically
think of risk aversion

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:39.860 align:middle line:84%
to mean strictly
averse to the lottery.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.010 align:middle line:84%
And hence, the linear case of
the linear utility function,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.170 align:middle line:84%
or weekly concave
function, but not

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:84%
strictly concave, we
call them risk neutral

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.780 align:middle line:90%
and not risk averse.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.380 align:middle line:90%
But I never said that in class.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.200 align:middle line:90%
So I'm amplifying.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.260 align:middle line:84%
But yes, risk aversion
is being risk averse.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.340 align:middle line:84%
Strictly speaking implies
strictly concave utility.

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.750 align:middle line:90%
So perfect, thank you.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:14.490 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:17.660 align:middle line:90%
So one more here.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.290 align:middle line:84%
This, again, is going to require
you to describe something.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.480 align:middle line:84%
Combining states and time of
the world, time and states

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.140 align:middle line:84%
of the world, what is the
complete commodity space

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.590 align:middle line:90%
for a consumer?

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:35.060 align:middle line:84%
And what I'm really
looking for is

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.680 align:middle line:84%
for you to describe to me the
tree of possibilities that we

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.900 align:middle line:90%
had on the slide last time.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.810 align:middle line:90%


00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.610 align:middle line:84%
And, again, I'll
take volunteers.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.750 align:middle line:90%


00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.940 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So this is a tree
that's oriented upwards.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.730 align:middle line:84%
And so at where time increases
as you go up in this tree.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.280 align:middle line:84%
As you make a specific
choice at any given time,

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.675 align:middle line:84%
you limit your future
options to some specific set,

00:07:08.675 --> 00:07:11.300 align:middle line:84%
and you exclude some others that
are no longer possible for you

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.800 align:middle line:90%
to consume.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.510 align:middle line:90%


00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.040 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's right.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:22.390 align:middle line:84%
So the tricky part
of it is to remember

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.170 align:middle line:84%
that the state of
the world at any date

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.230 align:middle line:84%
is not just a set of
possible realizations

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:31.330 align:middle line:90%
of the contemporary shock.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.890 align:middle line:84%
It also includes the history
of shocks, up to and including

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.550 align:middle line:90%
the contemporary date.

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:41.180 align:middle line:84%
So that's what's going
on with that tree.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.930 align:middle line:90%
You pick a node in the tree.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.740 align:middle line:84%
It's described not just by
the set of all things that

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.730 align:middle line:84%
could have happened
on the current branch,

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:56.410 align:middle line:84%
but the set of all things that
could possibly have happened up

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.260 align:middle line:90%
to and including that point.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.970 align:middle line:84%
And actually, I made
the comment in class

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.460 align:middle line:84%
that one has to consider
whether you're already

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.510 align:middle line:84%
at the current date, or
whether you're at date zero,

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.870 align:middle line:84%
imagining what could
happen in the future.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.582 align:middle line:84%
Because if you're at
zero and imagining

00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:16.290 align:middle line:84%
what could happen in
the future, then you

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:20.100 align:middle line:84%
have to delineate all
possible histories

00:08:20.100 --> 00:08:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and all possible states that
can happen in any given date,

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:27.945 align:middle line:84%
including up through and
including the date in question.

00:08:27.945 --> 00:08:30.860 align:middle line:90%


00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:31.500 align:middle line:90%
Great.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.000 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.169 align:middle line:90%


00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:37.240 align:middle line:84%
So, again, I earmarked
some of these.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.720 align:middle line:84%
I only went through
three of the four.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.750 align:middle line:90%
That was very helpful.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.570 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:51.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, so the lecture today is--

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:57.520 align:middle line:84%
so this is on dynamics
and dynamic programming.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.430 align:middle line:84%
It's going to focus
on this application

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:03.520 align:middle line:84%
for medieval
villages on storage,

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.050 align:middle line:84%
or call it inventory, or
carryover, as well as the seed

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.190 align:middle line:90%
that they put in the ground.

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.440 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come back
to that momentarily.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.670 align:middle line:84%
And if you go back to the
economic science lecture,

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:22.490 align:middle line:84%
this lecture is illustrative of
something we call calibration.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.290 align:middle line:84%
So you have a model of the
way the world works and you

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:28.840 align:middle line:84%
find, somehow,
parameter values that

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.850 align:middle line:90%
are appropriate for the model.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.270 align:middle line:84%
And then you simulate
the model and figure out

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.290 align:middle line:90%
how well it fits the data.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.710 align:middle line:84%
And if it fits reasonably
well, then it's

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.980 align:middle line:84%
a success, that you have
a logical explanation

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.790 align:middle line:84%
of in an artificial economy
of how the world actually

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.840 align:middle line:84%
works, or in this case,
past tense, was working.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
There should be another
bullet point here.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:56.950 align:middle line:84%
Because I like to feature and
earmark that when it comes up,

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.990 align:middle line:84%
we go through
various techniques.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:01.750 align:middle line:84%
And the technique that's
going to become apparent

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:03.500 align:middle line:90%
is dynamic programming.

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So most of the lectures up to
this point, not all of them

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.340 align:middle line:90%
were static.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.430 align:middle line:84%
We made an exception with
that interest rate and income

00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:16.000 align:middle line:84%
and substitution effects and
a couple of the consumption

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.230 align:middle line:90%
set diagrams.

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.030 align:middle line:84%
So time is playing
a big role here.

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.510 align:middle line:84%
And so if we're going to
solve a problem or program,

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.640 align:middle line:84%
it's going to be
a dynamic program.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.590 align:middle line:84%
And there's some
useful techniques

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.320 align:middle line:84%
that fall right out of
the end of this lecture.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.760 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to talk about
actual and potential use

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
of risk reduction arrangements,
namely carrying over grain

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.970 align:middle line:90%
from one year to the next.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.660 align:middle line:84%
This first line
says alternative,

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.690 align:middle line:84%
begging the issue of what
else have we looked at.

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.500 align:middle line:84%
Well, we looked at an individual
putting his strips of land

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.390 align:middle line:90%
all over the village.

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.500 align:middle line:84%
And I referred to that as
portfolio diversification

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.790 align:middle line:90%
at one point.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:00.530 align:middle line:84%
We looked at, and we
are about to see, again,

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.830 align:middle line:84%
the picture of the estates
of the Bishop of Winchester,

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.710 align:middle line:84%
which were spread
out over space,

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:08.350 align:middle line:90%
arguably, again, to diversify.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:10.930 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to
be stuck in one village,

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:13.570 align:middle line:84%
and effectively, with one
person in one village,

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:19.030 align:middle line:84%
on his or her own, looking for
alternative ways of reducing

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.780 align:middle line:90%
exposure to risk.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.870 align:middle line:84%
Now the stylized
facts, if we go back

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.480 align:middle line:84%
to the same Bishop of
Winchester accounts,

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.240 align:middle line:84%
we don't see a whole
lot of carryover.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:33.310 align:middle line:84%
There are one estate at
the time, rare spikes where

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:35.410 align:middle line:90%
a carryover jumps up.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And then the next
year, it's down.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.520 align:middle line:84%
I should say, or
this comes up later,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:44.770 align:middle line:84%
"carry over" means carried over
from one harvest to the next.

00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:48.280 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, time passes by
the day and by the month.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.080 align:middle line:84%
They only produce
one crop a year.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.320 align:middle line:84%
They have to have something
to eat during the interim.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.810 align:middle line:84%
So there is some
storage going on.

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.700 align:middle line:84%
The issue is
whether, by the time

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.410 align:middle line:84%
they get to the next
harvest, there's

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:00.910 align:middle line:90%
any storage left at all.

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.920 align:middle line:84%
And if there is, we
call it carryover.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Well, likewise, if you look
at the same estate accounts,

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.950 align:middle line:84%
at a point in time, you
can see that some of them

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:10.270 align:middle line:90%
have carryover.

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.960 align:middle line:90%
But most of them don't.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:16.157 align:middle line:84%
So this model is going to
be similar to a macro model.

00:12:16.157 --> 00:12:17.740 align:middle line:84%
That probably doesn't
mean much to you

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.240 align:middle line:84%
right now, a neoclassical
growth stabilization model.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.840 align:middle line:84%
We're going to put in two
kinds of storage technologies,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.590 align:middle line:84%
grain in the bin for storage,
but also seed in the ground,

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.530 align:middle line:84%
because that's another way
to carry over the crop,

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.073 align:middle line:90%
by planting it.

00:12:34.073 --> 00:12:35.740 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
choose the parameters

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.020 align:middle line:84%
to be consistent with
the available data.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:42.040 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to, again, look
at the numerical predictions

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:45.460 align:middle line:84%
of the model and see if we can
match the fact that carryover

00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:47.140 align:middle line:90%
was not common.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.960 align:middle line:84%
This goes more into
how uncommon it

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.010 align:middle line:84%
was where, if they're not
carrying anything over,

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.380 align:middle line:84%
and there's only one
person in a village,

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.150 align:middle line:84%
like Robinson Crusoe
as an abstraction,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.150 align:middle line:84%
then they're eating
all their output--

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.980 align:middle line:84%
well, maybe-- over a
12-month time period.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:07.030 align:middle line:84%
So variability in
consumption is one to one

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:09.440 align:middle line:90%
with variability in output.

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.330 align:middle line:84%
And if output varies a lot,
that's a lot of risk to bear.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.790 align:middle line:84%
We have data from
that same lord.

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Treating him as the
single villager,

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:22.360 align:middle line:84%
we can look at output
as representative output

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:28.840 align:middle line:84%
in the population and see,
in the cross section in 1236,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:32.320 align:middle line:84%
only three of the 18
states had carryover.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:35.560 align:middle line:84%
In a good year,
there was carryover.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:38.230 align:middle line:84%
1223 was good, for
example, for one

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.370 align:middle line:84%
of those estates with
57% of the crop being

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:44.140 align:middle line:90%
stored till next year.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:48.710 align:middle line:84%
And the following year for
that same estate, 1224,

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.450 align:middle line:90%
zero carryover.

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.960 align:middle line:90%
This is a review picture.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.460 align:middle line:84%
These are the estates of
the Bishop of Winchester.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:57.710 align:middle line:84%
And as I said last time,
it's hard to figure out

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:00.740 align:middle line:84%
what country you're in, let
alone where you are in it.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.870 align:middle line:84%
But this is the English
Channel down here.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:08.840 align:middle line:84%
So all these dots are the
Bishop's of Winchester estates.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's the context
that's generating the data.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, two ways to store,
well, actually, four.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.710 align:middle line:84%
We're going to adopt two of them
and rule out the two others.

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:21.350 align:middle line:84%
Not model the two
others, I should say.

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:24.500 align:middle line:84%
In the artificial
economy, first, grain

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.280 align:middle line:84%
can be stored after harvest,
as I've been saying.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:31.460 align:middle line:84%
Second, they could take
some of that harvest

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.730 align:middle line:84%
and put the grain in
the ground as seed

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.160 align:middle line:90%
planted for next year's crop.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:40.100 align:middle line:84%
The other things we're not going
to consider is taking the grain

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.840 align:middle line:90%
and feeding it to the animals.

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:44.390 align:middle line:84%
And eventually, you
might kill the animal.

00:14:44.390 --> 00:14:47.390 align:middle line:84%
So in some respects, you're
carrying over the calories

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.050 align:middle line:90%
from the grain.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.920 align:middle line:84%
But it's not very efficient,
since the animals are also

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.290 align:middle line:90%
surviving on the grain.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.460 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have
animals in the model.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.910 align:middle line:84%
Another more humorous
possibility is beer.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.930 align:middle line:84%
So they would take the grain
and ferment it and make

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.200 align:middle line:84%
barley malt, for example,
which English people still

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.747 align:middle line:84%
like to drink quite a bit,
no doubt due to this history.

00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:14.330 align:middle line:84%
But we're not going
to do that either,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:90%
no drinking in the model.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:19.130 align:middle line:84%
So let's take this
storage possibility.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.530 align:middle line:84%
The most obvious one
is you take the grain

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.860 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the bin,
and potentially have some

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:90%
left or not by next harvest.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.750 align:middle line:84%
How the depreciation rate being
delta, why does grain go bad?

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, in England, it's
a very wet climate.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:39.950 align:middle line:84%
If it gets wet, and the grain
gets wet if it's not secured,

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.060 align:middle line:90%
it spoils.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:44.030 align:middle line:84%
Mildew, even if it doesn't
directly rain on the grain,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:45.800 align:middle line:90%
is not good for the grain.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And grain gets eaten by
rats and other rodents.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.900 align:middle line:84%
And you may think
that's humorous.

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.090 align:middle line:90%
But it is real.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:55.730 align:middle line:84%
I know in Thailand,
we would go and look

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:58.520 align:middle line:84%
at what they call the rice
bank, which was a shed where

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.200 align:middle line:90%
they had stored the rice.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.030 align:middle line:84%
And they were
showing us the shed.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:04.970 align:middle line:84%
And as they opened the door,
all these mice ran out.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.070 align:middle line:90%
So we're eating the grain.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.250 align:middle line:90%
How big is delta?

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.160 align:middle line:90%
We have to calibrate this model.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:15.560 align:middle line:84%
So drawing from McCloskey, you
can see prices increasing month

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.110 align:middle line:84%
after month after
month, from harvest

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.060 align:middle line:90%
up through the next month.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:25.500 align:middle line:84%
And from this fact, McCloskey
gets a depreciation rate of 30%

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:28.430 align:middle line:84%
So here's that table
that he's using.

00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:31.550 align:middle line:84%
Between September and
October, grain prices

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:36.620 align:middle line:84%
inflated by 3 and 1/2%, between
October and November, 2 and.

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:37.520 align:middle line:90%
1/4%.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So these are kind of grain
price inflation rates

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.690 align:middle line:90%
through the year.

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:46.550 align:middle line:84%
And roughly, if you add them
up and do a little compounding,

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.230 align:middle line:90%
you'll get 30%.

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:49.730 align:middle line:90%
Now who cares?

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:54.830 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's imagine that
whatever you store at one date,

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:59.930 align:middle line:84%
you get back 1 minus
delta that number,

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:02.030 align:middle line:90%
say, the following month.

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:03.270 align:middle line:90%
It's linear.

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:05.930 align:middle line:84%
You don't get out what
you put in 1 to 1.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:12.109 align:middle line:84%
If the depreciation were 30%,
you put in 1, you get back 0.7.

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:13.910 align:middle line:90%
You put in 10, you get back 7.

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:14.900 align:middle line:90%
It's linear.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:19.280 align:middle line:84%
The storage technology displays
constant returns to scale.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.640 align:middle line:84%
If you were a firm
maximizing profits

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.940 align:middle line:84%
by the choice of how
much to store over time,

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.080 align:middle line:84%
you would be thinking
about this constant returns

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.970 align:middle line:84%
to scale technology and asking,
how much would they be storing,

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.790 align:middle line:84%
depending on how much
the price next month is

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:39.600 align:middle line:90%
relative to the price today.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.170 align:middle line:90%
So it says exercise.

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:44.330 align:middle line:84%
So I urge you to
write that down.

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.700 align:middle line:84%
I did it just to make
sure this morning.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.960 align:middle line:84%
It's, like, maximize
P1 times y minus i,

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:57.170 align:middle line:84%
where i is investment, plus
P2 times Y2 plus i multiplied

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:58.460 align:middle line:90%
by 1 minus delta.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:00.770 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of silly to be
describing this in words.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:03.800 align:middle line:84%
Now what do you know about
constant returns to scale?

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:05.930 align:middle line:84%
You already know,
with constant returns

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.630 align:middle line:84%
to scale when we did the
Production Lecture 4,

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.870 align:middle line:84%
that the solution is either
infinite or indeterminate

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.740 align:middle line:90%
or zero.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.750 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's not indeterminate.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.840 align:middle line:84%
And it's not zero, either,
because they were storing

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.400 align:middle line:90%
from month to month, at least.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.750 align:middle line:84%
So the premise is that, in order
to compensate the economics is,

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.960 align:middle line:84%
in order to compensate
for the loss of the crop,

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.050 align:middle line:84%
rather than selling it
today at a certain price,

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:31.850 align:middle line:84%
they can sell it
tomorrow they're going

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:35.100 align:middle line:90%
to have 70% left, a 30% loss.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.810 align:middle line:84%
So the price has to accumulate
at 30% over the year.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.090 align:middle line:84%
I'm going back and forth
between month and years.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.840 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.800 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
economic intuition.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.740 align:middle line:90%
And you already know the math.

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.870 align:middle line:84%
So that's one
advantage for us having

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.600 align:middle line:84%
spent some time on production
and, in particular,

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.410 align:middle line:90%
on profit maximization.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:58.580 align:middle line:84%
So you know how McCloskey is
calibrating parameter delta.

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:03.890 align:middle line:84%
Second possibility is
putting seed in the ground.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.970 align:middle line:84%
Now it turns out that's
a pretty healthy return.

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.820 align:middle line:90%
We have some data on that.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.810 align:middle line:84%
And the yield to seed
ratio is about 2.6

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.870 align:middle line:84%
for one of these manners
and 1.67 for the other one.

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:25.430 align:middle line:84%
So that's a yield-to-seed
ratio, meaning you get roughly,

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.820 align:middle line:84%
taking the average,
two units of output

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.810 align:middle line:90%
for every units of input.

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:33.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty productive.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.280 align:middle line:84%
So if we stopped
right there, you'd

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.290 align:middle line:84%
say, well, putting
seed in the ground

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.750 align:middle line:84%
is a lot more productive
than depreciation,

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.750 align:middle line:90%
even setting aside the risk.

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:44.980 align:middle line:84%
Well, so there's a
couple of things.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.150 align:middle line:84%
One, there's a limit to how much
seed you can put in the ground.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.860 align:middle line:84%
And two, we're going to
be considering the risk.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.280 align:middle line:90%
So here's the technology.

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:90%
If you planted Kt units--

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.120 align:middle line:84%
put Kt seeds in the
ground, at t minus 1,

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.630 align:middle line:84%
the output would be a
function f of that amount

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.190 align:middle line:90%
of seed, the harvest.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:07.230 align:middle line:90%
And there's some shock epsilon.

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:10.320 align:middle line:84%
In fact, let's assume this
is a linear technology.

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.720 align:middle line:84%
So whatever seed got
put in the ground,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.490 align:middle line:90%
alpha times it is the output.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:15.900 align:middle line:90%
Alpha could be 2.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.710 align:middle line:84%
And epsilon is a shock that's
going to make it random

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:20.970 align:middle line:90%
and make it move around.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:26.220 align:middle line:84%
OK, first thing, you can't plant
an unbounded amount of seed.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:29.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the best way to think
about this is the seed per unit

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:31.110 align:middle line:90%
land is constant.

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:33.960 align:middle line:84%
You have so much
land, there's no point

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.370 align:middle line:90%
in putting down more seed.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.180 align:middle line:84%
So it's really a decision
about how much land to plant.

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.770 align:middle line:84%
And we'll put an
upper bound on that

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.540 align:middle line:84%
because there are
finite land holdings.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.740 align:middle line:84%
So K bar is going to be the
most land that you can plant.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.390 align:middle line:90%
You plant all of your land.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And if you were to try
to put down more seed,

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.890 align:middle line:90%
it's like throwing it away.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:55.830 align:middle line:84%
You're still going to only
have the maximum amount,

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.860 align:middle line:84%
K bar in this case
times epsilon alpha.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:05.335 align:middle line:84%
So we're about ready to
get to a key equation here.

00:21:05.335 --> 00:21:06.210 align:middle line:90%
Let's do it this way.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.000 align:middle line:84%
If you focus on
equation 1, you've

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.420 align:middle line:84%
got output f, harvest, which is
a function of the seed planted

00:21:15.420 --> 00:21:19.480 align:middle line:84%
last year plus an
influence of epsilon.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.720 align:middle line:84%
Now you could have had
something in storage as well.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.360 align:middle line:84%
Imagine they had
done both things.

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.860 align:middle line:84%
So they put some
seed in the ground.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.480 align:middle line:90%
And they had some storage.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.310 align:middle line:84%
You're going to get
1 minus delta times

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:31.200 align:middle line:90%
that amount of storage back.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.660 align:middle line:84%
And that would be the end of
the story for consumption,

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.850 align:middle line:84%
except they have to
plan for next year.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So they still have these two
options, storage planted now

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:43.200 align:middle line:84%
at t that will be
available at t plus 1,

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.360 align:middle line:84%
and seed, which they
can squirrel away now,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:49.380 align:middle line:84%
which will be
planted and influence

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.290 align:middle line:90%
the harvest at Kt plus 1.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.540 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of weird dating.

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Please be alert to that.

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:02.380 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the last slide for
today will change the dating.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:05.020 align:middle line:84%
Different people use
different conventions.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:07.780 align:middle line:84%
What I'm complaining
about, or alerting you,

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:10.690 align:middle line:84%
is this is
consumption at date t.

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And these things, seed in
the ground and inventory,

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.270 align:middle line:90%
have a date t on them.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:19.900 align:middle line:84%
But they are predetermined
from t minus 1.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.120 align:middle line:84%
They are not decision
variables at t.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:27.040 align:middle line:84%
The decision variables at
t are labeled t plus 1.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.560 align:middle line:84%
The pro case for
doing it this way

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.580 align:middle line:84%
is that we care about the state
variable at a given day t,

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.630 align:middle line:84%
and that's determined by the
seed that they planted before

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:40.870 align:middle line:84%
and the inventory that
they have from before.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.490 align:middle line:90%
Anyway, just to alert you.

00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:46.100 align:middle line:84%
I trust you will interrupt
me when you have questions.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So this is the amount
that's available.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:52.810 align:middle line:84%
This is the amount that you
squirrel away for next year.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.430 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
between what's available

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:58.720 align:middle line:84%
and what you store in one way
or another is consumption.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.780 align:middle line:84%
Now the risk averse, we
discussed that a minute

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.290 align:middle line:84%
ago, so this is a
strictly concave utility

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:10.190 align:middle line:84%
function over consumption over
a finite number of dates t.

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:14.810 align:middle line:84%
So this runs from 1 to
capital T. Hopefully,

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:17.810 align:middle line:84%
capital T is really
a long time away.

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:20.060 align:middle line:90%
And I'll come back to that.

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:21.770 align:middle line:84%
Alternatively, I
could have written

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:23.450 align:middle line:90%
cap T equal to infinity.

00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:25.100 align:middle line:90%
They live forever.

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.850 align:middle line:84%
But we're not quite
ready to do that.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.140 align:middle line:84%
So I'm just going to show
you finite time horizon first

00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:33.290 align:middle line:84%
and then argue how to extend
it at the end of the class

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.600 align:middle line:84%
when we get to
dynamic programming.

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.760 align:middle line:90%
There's a discounted utility.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.630 align:middle line:84%
Beta is a discount rate,
beta some number less than 1.

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.610 align:middle line:84%
So you care about
the present more

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:46.220 align:middle line:84%
than you care about the
future, present utility

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.840 align:middle line:90%
more than future utility.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.540 align:middle line:84%
This is, with beta
less than 1, geometric.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.470 align:middle line:84%
You can see, as the horizon
gets further and further away,

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:58.560 align:middle line:84%
you care less and less relative
to today's consumption.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.510 align:middle line:84%
But these are strictly concave,
so you don't like variability.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.270 align:middle line:84%
We talked about
concave utility when we

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.100 align:middle line:90%
introduced the concept of risk.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:11.030 align:middle line:84%
Here, even if there
were no risks,

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:13.940 align:middle line:84%
they would try to avoid
variability in consumption.

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:17.000 align:middle line:84%
They'd rather have the
same consumption every day,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.970 align:middle line:84%
rather than having it low
one date and high another.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.100 align:middle line:84%
Because the utility
consequence of that

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.390 align:middle line:84%
would be less than
having the same amount.

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:28.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the context
drift concavity is coming in.

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So we already calibrated the
depreciation rate at 30%.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.380 align:middle line:84%
The discount rate we're
going to put at 0.95.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.520 align:middle line:84%
Which is kind of standard,
although we could vary it,

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.990 align:middle line:90%
we could make it lower.

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:43.730 align:middle line:84%
Once we have the
program written,

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.710 align:middle line:90%
we can plug in whatever we want.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.840 align:middle line:84%
Ideally, though,
the spirit of this

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.110 align:middle line:84%
should be that we're somewhat
confident about these numbers

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.430 align:middle line:90%
we're about to choose.

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:56.150 align:middle line:84%
Constant relative risk aversion,
I defined that utility function

00:24:56.150 --> 00:24:57.380 align:middle line:90%
last time.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.820 align:middle line:84%
That's seed to the gamma
divided by sometimes normalized.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
set that at 0.5.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.730 align:middle line:90%
This is kind of a low number.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.820 align:middle line:84%
It's definitely a
strictly concave utility,

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:10.950 align:middle line:84%
but they may have been even
more risk averse than that.

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:16.670 align:middle line:84%
However, you'll see this ex post
justification that all three

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:18.560 align:middle line:84%
of these numbers
kind of work in terms

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.260 align:middle line:90%
of explaining the paradox.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:24.680 align:middle line:84%
Namely, they're about to
starve to death every 12 years.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.570 align:middle line:84%
And they weren't
storing anything.

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.970 align:middle line:90%
That's the paradox.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.920 align:middle line:84%
Back to that epsilon,
this is the way

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.240 align:middle line:90%
you put the uncertainty in.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.440 align:middle line:84%
One unit of land planted
today yields two tomorrow.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.010 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
yield-to-seed ratio.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But there is a
little uncertainty.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.900 align:middle line:84%
10 out of 12 times,
you get 2 tomorrow.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
But 1/12 of the time,
you get 1/2 of it.

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:53.370 align:middle line:84%
And 1/12 of the time,
you get 4, double it.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:57.650 align:middle line:84%
So the expected yield
is a little bit above 2,

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.040 align:middle line:84%
since the weights, 1/12 are same
on the low and the high end.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.010 align:middle line:90%
But 4 is 2 times greater than 2.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
And the difference
between 2 and 1 is just 1.

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So it's just the expected value
is slightly higher than 2.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.760 align:middle line:84%
We're going to set the
upper bound on storage at 1.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.590 align:middle line:84%
And this number, 1/12,
I actually just set y.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And you may be reminded
of that when you go back

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.300 align:middle line:84%
and look at, in the data,
the coefficient of variation

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.610 align:middle line:84%
that we introduced
last time of yields.

00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:33.410 align:middle line:84%
It was 0.35, which meant
roughly every 12 years,

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:38.070 align:middle line:84%
output fell below less than
half of the mean value.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:middle line:84%
So we called that disaster last
time for these scattered plots.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:48.192 align:middle line:84%
So this mass over here under
the solid density is 1/12.

00:26:48.192 --> 00:26:50.150 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] it's also
true they could get lucky

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:51.810 align:middle line:90%
and have a high yield.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.020 align:middle line:84%
So you saw this
picture last time.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.880 align:middle line:84%
I'm really just using
it to remind you

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.180 align:middle line:84%
of the context of where
the risk is coming from.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.730 align:middle line:84%
We wanted-- we
just did calibrate

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.760 align:middle line:84%
the yield-to-seed
ratio in such a way

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:09.220 align:middle line:84%
as to deliver disaster
every 12 years, on average.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:13.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's look at the
dynamic decision problem.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:16.910 align:middle line:84%
Let's call this the
total available this year

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.060 align:middle line:84%
and denote, on the
y-axis so to speak,

00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:23.660 align:middle line:84%
the amount of each of the
possible savings decisions,

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.440 align:middle line:84%
either of storage or planting,
back to the key equation.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:32.030 align:middle line:84%
The amount available is
this, output plus storage.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:36.978 align:middle line:84%
And the savings decisions
are inventory or seed.

00:27:36.978 --> 00:27:38.270 align:middle line:90%
So that's what's being plotted.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:41.260 align:middle line:90%


00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.770 align:middle line:84%
But we are varying the
total amount available

00:27:44.770 --> 00:27:47.500 align:middle line:90%
going from 0 to 6.

00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.580 align:middle line:90%
And let's look at--

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:54.530 align:middle line:90%
oh, where is this coming from?

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:57.400 align:middle line:84%
So we actually
solved this problem.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.960 align:middle line:84%
We maximize 2
subject to 1, putting

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.620 align:middle line:90%
in all these parameters.

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:07.566 align:middle line:90%
And I didn't show you the code.

00:28:07.566 --> 00:28:09.880 align:middle line:84%
You can solve it on
Matlab or something.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.730 align:middle line:90%
I'm not asking you to do that.

00:28:12.730 --> 00:28:17.140 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, it's, like, this
picture could be anything.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:21.690 align:middle line:84%
It's pinned down, because it's
the solution to a max problem

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:24.580 align:middle line:90%
at the calibrated parameters.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.960 align:middle line:84%
So this is our model version of
what they were doing, in fact.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:34.890 align:middle line:84%
So if the total amount available
was a little less than 1,

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:38.940 align:middle line:84%
then they were not
planting all the land,

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.870 align:middle line:90%
despite that high yield.

00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:44.700 align:middle line:84%
However, for anything else,
they hit the upper bound,

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.070 align:middle line:84%
and they plant
everything they can

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:51.130 align:middle line:90%
at the upper bound, which was 1.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.080 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the
storage decision.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.400 align:middle line:84%
As a function of
the total available,

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:59.080 align:middle line:84%
it's only when the total
available is 3 or higher

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.630 align:middle line:90%
that positive storage kicks in.

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:05.260 align:middle line:84%
And when it does,
it's moving linearly

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.870 align:middle line:84%
with the amount
available this year.

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.730 align:middle line:90%
It's actually not moving 1 to 1.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:14.230 align:middle line:84%
If it were 1 to 1, higher
available means higher storage,

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.750 align:middle line:84%
it would be parallel
with this 45 degree line.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:18.580 align:middle line:90%
But it's not.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.170 align:middle line:90%
So they never store 1 to 1.

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:23.390 align:middle line:84%
They may store less
than the harvest.

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:28.240 align:middle line:84%
But they are storing
some, something here.

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:28.740 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:31.860 align:middle line:90%
So those are the savings plans.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.230 align:middle line:84%
Things to keep in
the back of your mind

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:36.630 align:middle line:84%
when we go through some
of the other slides

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.900 align:middle line:84%
is the fact that mostly they
put all the seed in the ground,

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.800 align:middle line:84%
but not when the amount
available is less

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:47.970 align:middle line:84%
and the amount of
storage is zero,

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:51.600 align:middle line:84%
unless the amount
available is above 3.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.300 align:middle line:90%
Now how much is consumption?

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, back to this
thing, so consumption

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.560 align:middle line:84%
is the difference between the
amount available and those two

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.130 align:middle line:90%
savings decisions.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.700 align:middle line:84%
So if you look at this
diagram, consumption

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.320 align:middle line:84%
is the difference between
the amount available

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.290 align:middle line:90%
and the sum of these decisions.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.930 align:middle line:84%
This 45-degree line
is now playing a role.

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:17.070 align:middle line:84%
Because the amount
available, say, 2,

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:19.270 align:middle line:90%
go up to the 45-degree line.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:22.080 align:middle line:90%
Then this amount is 2.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.430 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition
of the 45-degree line.

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.930 align:middle line:90%
Right?

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.960 align:middle line:84%
It's a way to convert
the units on the x-axis

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.880 align:middle line:84%
to the same amount
on the y-axis.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.080 align:middle line:90%
That's convenient here.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:32.880 align:middle line:84%
Because we can
look at, OK, here's

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:36.480 align:middle line:84%
the amount that would
be available next year

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.950 align:middle line:90%
if they didn't save anything.

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:40.200 align:middle line:84%
But they are storing
in this case.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:44.040 align:middle line:84%
So consumption is the difference
between this 45-degree line

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.190 align:middle line:84%
and the sum of these
two other lines.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:50.220 align:middle line:84%
That means that as
we get over here,

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.980 align:middle line:84%
the 45-degree line is really
close to the only thing they're

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:56.620 align:middle line:84%
doing, which is planting
seed, and very close.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:01.440 align:middle line:84%
So when you have less than
1.1 available this year,

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.580 align:middle line:90%
they're still eating.

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.410 align:middle line:84%
And they're not
planting all the land,

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:06.060 align:middle line:90%
but they're not eating much.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.650 align:middle line:90%
It's a really hard problem.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:09.780 align:middle line:84%
Do we starve now
or starve later?

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:14.310 align:middle line:84%
I mean, they kind of gamble on
getting a reasonable return.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:18.480 align:middle line:84%
If they ate the seed, they
have nothing tomorrow.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.230 align:middle line:84%
They're starving
to death for sure.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.950 align:middle line:84%
In fact, I don't if you've
heard this expression,

00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:middle line:90%
don't eat the seed corn.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:27.600 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that came right
out of this episode.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.120 align:middle line:84%
Eating the seed corn is the
worst thing you could do.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:33.330 align:middle line:84%
Because you're kind of
guaranteeing zero for tomorrow.

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:35.100 align:middle line:90%
But they actually do cut back.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.180 align:middle line:90%
They eat some of it.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:41.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, so this is a related way
to think about the dynamics.

00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.920 align:middle line:84%
Let's take total
available this year,

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.260 align:middle line:84%
implement those two
savings decisions

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:49.380 align:middle line:84%
on the previous
diagram, and then ask

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.870 align:middle line:84%
how much are you going
to have next year.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.535 align:middle line:90%
Sorry if I'm belaboring this.

00:31:53.535 --> 00:31:56.040 align:middle line:84%
This is the amount
available this year.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.110 align:middle line:90%
You can save it or eat it.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.860 align:middle line:84%
If you save it in one or the
other of these two devices,

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.910 align:middle line:84%
we're now talking about the
first part of this equation

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:06.750 align:middle line:90%
with the two terms.

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:09.630 align:middle line:90%
But the date would be t plus 1.

00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.820 align:middle line:84%
So this would be the
amount available next year,

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.970 align:middle line:84%
given the amount available
this year and the endogenously

00:32:16.970 --> 00:32:20.000 align:middle line:84%
determined-- oh, I used that
word for the first time--

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.500 align:middle line:84%
endogenously determined
savings decisions.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.740 align:middle line:84%
So here, we can't plot
savings and the total amount

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:31.890 align:middle line:84%
available unless we're in
some 3-dimensional space.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:33.890 align:middle line:84%
So the savings decisions
are suppressed,

00:32:33.890 --> 00:32:35.420 align:middle line:90%
though they're still active.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.690 align:middle line:84%
Well, first of all,
output is stochastic.

00:32:38.690 --> 00:32:43.250 align:middle line:84%
Epsilon could be and likely to
be medium, but it could be high

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:45.170 align:middle line:90%
or it could be low.

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So the amount that's available
next year, even given

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.660 align:middle line:84%
the savings decisions,
will vary with the epsilon.

00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.190 align:middle line:84%
So if you had three units
available this year, which

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.500 align:middle line:84%
is right on the
margin of storing,

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:04.450 align:middle line:84%
say zero, the most likely
outcome next year is medium.

00:33:04.450 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:84%
And hence, there would be two
units available next year.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And so there would be no
storage next year, either.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:13.360 align:middle line:84%
So what do those
words correspond to?

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:16.330 align:middle line:84%
You're at three
units available now.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:19.330 align:middle line:84%
The most likely outcome
next year is medium.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.910 align:middle line:84%
The amount available
next year is two.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:24.340 align:middle line:84%
And, again, from the
savings decisions,

00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:28.720 align:middle line:84%
storage at three and at
two is zero, so no storage.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.490 align:middle line:84%
So this is like what
would happen over time.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.010 align:middle line:90%
But let's just come back.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.200 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we redid
this experiment,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.510 align:middle line:84%
and you had two units
available this year,

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:39.760 align:middle line:84%
and then you got
the medium output.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.180 align:middle line:90%
You would have two units.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.210 align:middle line:90%
So what does that referring to?

00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:46.100 align:middle line:84%
If we have two units
available this year,

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.510 align:middle line:84%
and you had the medium output,
which is the most likely thing,

00:33:49.510 --> 00:33:52.790 align:middle line:84%
you get 2 units available
for the following year.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So two in and two out is
the most likely outcome

00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.830 align:middle line:90%
if you start with two.

00:33:56.830 --> 00:33:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So you could refer to that
as a kind of steady state,

00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:02.020 align:middle line:90%
meaning things aren't moving.

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.200 align:middle line:90%
Actually, they are moving.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.260 align:middle line:84%
So technically, it's
not a steady state,

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.120 align:middle line:84%
because we picked
a particular shock.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:09.070 align:middle line:90%
But it is the most likely shock.

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.400 align:middle line:84%
So it's approximately true
that if you have two today,

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.139 align:middle line:84%
you're going to
have two tomorrow.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:17.230 align:middle line:84%
But if you had two units
available this year,

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:22.300 align:middle line:84%
and you got the low output,
epsilon 1/12 being probability,

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:24.909 align:middle line:84%
the output available
next year is about one.

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:27.909 align:middle line:84%
And at that point, you're
not planting all the land.

00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:29.139 align:middle line:90%
So that's over here.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:31.690 align:middle line:84%
You could have two today
and get really unlucky

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:35.620 align:middle line:84%
and have less than two
available, about one available

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:36.500 align:middle line:90%
next year.

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.520 align:middle line:84%
And, again, if you memorized
a bit, those savings diagrams,

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.239 align:middle line:84%
with one available,
you're not storing.

00:34:43.239 --> 00:34:46.480 align:middle line:84%
And you're eating
some of the seed.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.000 align:middle line:90%
So let's go the other way.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.949 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you had two units
available, which is, roughly

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:54.219 align:middle line:84%
speaking, a reasonable starting
point, and you got lucky

00:34:54.219 --> 00:34:55.820 align:middle line:90%
and got the high output.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.580 align:middle line:84%
Then you would
finally be storing.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.880 align:middle line:84%
Suppose you had two, and instead
of getting the medium yield,

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.020 align:middle line:90%
you got the high yield.

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Then you'd have four
units available next year.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.850 align:middle line:84%
And at four units
available, there's

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:08.900 align:middle line:90%
definitely storage going on.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.180 align:middle line:90%
So that's carryover.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:11.920 align:middle line:90%
Rare, but it can happen.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.150 align:middle line:90%
Does it persist?

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:16.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, suppose, just to
run this experiment,

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:18.550 align:middle line:84%
that you get lucky
and lucky and lucky.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:21.400 align:middle line:90%
So where would you end up?

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:24.490 align:middle line:84%
You'd end up at roughly
a little above four.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.760 align:middle line:84%
Four replicates itself,
four in, four out.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.270 align:middle line:90%
It's on the 45-degree line.

00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So that's the best
case scenario,

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.690 align:middle line:90%
that you would converge to that.

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.180 align:middle line:90%
And you would be storing.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.520 align:middle line:84%
But I'm sure you
can see this coming.

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:40.030 align:middle line:84%
If you were at that fortunate
situation with storage,

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:42.620 align:middle line:90%
you got a medium or low output.

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:84%
Then you would climb
back below three.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.590 align:middle line:84%
And you wouldn't
be storing at all.

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:51.550 align:middle line:84%
So they had carryover once
in a while, but not often.

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:52.450 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:53.680 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.555 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes?

00:35:54.555 --> 00:35:57.800 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: If the
depreciation rate goes down,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.665 align:middle line:84%
then the inventory
line will move, right?

00:36:00.665 --> 00:36:02.290 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: It
will move up, yeah.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:03.670 align:middle line:90%
It would shift up.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:08.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, it would not only
have a higher slope,

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:11.387 align:middle line:90%
but it would kick in earlier.

00:36:11.387 --> 00:36:11.970 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:17.280 align:middle line:84%
So it is also implied that
in the medieval England maybe

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.500 align:middle line:84%
the depreciation
rate was so high,

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.620 align:middle line:84%
so the carryover was so
low, or we cannot observe

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.557 align:middle line:90%
the carryover.

00:36:27.557 --> 00:36:28.890 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Say that again?

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:34.050 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I mean, maybe it
implies that in the medieval

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:37.500 align:middle line:84%
England, the depreciation
rate is so high,

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:42.690 align:middle line:84%
that is why we cannot
observe the carryover.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:43.960 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.550 align:middle line:90%
Well, if--

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.030 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:49.620 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
I mean, we picked

00:36:49.620 --> 00:36:52.080 align:middle line:90%
it to try to match the data.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.150 align:middle line:84%
You could run the model with
a higher or lower number.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:59.130 align:middle line:84%
If we make the depreciation
rate less severe,

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:03.920 align:middle line:84%
so it's like 20% or 30%,
they would store more often.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And then we would have
to look at that diagram

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:09.290 align:middle line:84%
and see whether
carryover is still rare.

00:37:09.290 --> 00:37:13.610 align:middle line:84%
I mean, I imagine if
you go from 30% to 28%

00:37:13.610 --> 00:37:17.360 align:middle line:84%
or even 25%, not too
much might change.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:22.880 align:middle line:84%
But it's clear if you ran
the depreciation to zero,

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.990 align:middle line:84%
then they're going to
be storing quite a lot.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:28.430 align:middle line:84%
They would have
a way of carrying

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:31.190 align:middle line:90%
the crop over one to one.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:34.640 align:middle line:84%
It would still be
uncertain, but that

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.470 align:middle line:84%
would be a big
step toward keeping

00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:40.040 align:middle line:90%
their consumption steady.

00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:40.953 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:40.953 --> 00:37:41.870 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.430 align:middle line:90%
So no, it's a great question.

00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:47.540 align:middle line:84%
Because that parameter and
all the other ones are key.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.600 align:middle line:84%
We could vary each,
one at a time.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.745 align:middle line:84%
We could make them more
risk averse, for example.

00:37:52.745 --> 00:37:53.370 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:57.470 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That would
be an interesting experiment.

00:37:57.470 --> 00:38:03.590 align:middle line:84%
Then they're going to be more
worried about that low output.

00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:05.660 align:middle line:84%
And that probably
means they're going

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:11.350 align:middle line:84%
to be trying to maintain
more seed and more inventory,

00:38:11.350 --> 00:38:12.930 align:middle line:90%
which one I'm not quite sure.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's an upper
bound on the amount

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.540 align:middle line:84%
of seed, the amount of
land they can plant.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably going
to push inventory up.

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:27.870 align:middle line:84%
That's a version of what we saw
last time in a static context.

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:32.290 align:middle line:84%
Namely, that you're
willing to accept something

00:38:32.290 --> 00:38:36.590 align:middle line:84%
less than the mean return
in order to guarantee,

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:37.625 align:middle line:90%
to get rid of the risk.

00:38:37.625 --> 00:38:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:47.780 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, even with
storage being somewhat costly,

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.415 align:middle line:84%
when they're risk
averse, then we

00:38:49.415 --> 00:38:51.240 align:middle line:84%
could make them even
more risk averse.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.050 align:middle line:84%
They're going to be
more inclined to give up

00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:56.330 align:middle line:84%
some of the
consumption today, even

00:38:56.330 --> 00:39:00.920 align:middle line:84%
though it's going to not
survive the rats into tomorrow.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.030 align:middle line:84%
Because when they have
it, the consumption today

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.610 align:middle line:84%
and consumption tomorrow are
more likely to be the same.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.230 align:middle line:90%


00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.720 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.310 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Beta matters.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.290 align:middle line:84%
If beta goes to zero, you
don't care about the future.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, these guys
would be very myopic.

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:23.440 align:middle line:84%
And they would be behaving
very differently, and so on.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.930 align:middle line:90%
So all these parameters matter.

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:27.040 align:middle line:90%
I guess I got lucky.

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:31.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, some of these
parameters were picked.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.030 align:middle line:84%
And I was complaining they
seem a little bit off,

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:36.400 align:middle line:90%
like beta and risk aversion.

00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:39.850 align:middle line:84%
But that, along with
the depreciation rate

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:44.260 align:middle line:84%
and the very carefully
calibrated technology,

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:51.280 align:middle line:84%
did succeed in
producing the data.

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.330 align:middle line:90%
So I want to come back to this.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.250 align:middle line:90%
We cheated a bit.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.470 align:middle line:84%
Because we had a
finite horizon and then

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.870 align:middle line:90%
I kind of told you to ignore it.

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:04.710 align:middle line:84%
That diagram was produced as
if the horizon was infinite.

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.360 align:middle line:90%
And how would I know that?

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:09.150 align:middle line:84%
Because if the horizon
is finite, then

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:11.760 align:middle line:84%
unlike those figures,
the amount stored

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.390 align:middle line:84%
is going to depend on
how many years are left.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:18.520 align:middle line:84%
Intuitively, if you're
at the terminal date--

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.760 align:middle line:84%
it sounds kind of
foreboding, no?

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.840 align:middle line:90%
The terminal date?

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.030 align:middle line:84%
Well, you've got
one more year to go.

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.780 align:middle line:90%
That's it.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.100 align:middle line:90%
Eat now.

00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.780 align:middle line:84%
You're not going to
be around tomorrow.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:30.630 align:middle line:84%
So there's not any
savings in seed.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:32.490 align:middle line:90%
There's not any storage.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.710 align:middle line:84%
Now you could move back
from there to the next

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.220 align:middle line:84%
to the last date,
knowing that you're not

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.330 align:middle line:90%
going to save tomorrow.

00:40:39.330 --> 00:40:42.660 align:middle line:84%
You're still facing a choice
between today and tomorrow,

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.560 align:middle line:90%
or this year versus next year.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.890 align:middle line:84%
So you could solve that
two period problem.

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:49.200 align:middle line:84%
We call this working
back from the end, right?

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:51.360 align:middle line:90%
We start at the last date.

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.220 align:middle line:84%
We move to the next
to the last date

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.500 align:middle line:84%
and solve the
maximization problem.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.530 align:middle line:84%
Substitute in the
values, and then we

00:40:58.530 --> 00:41:02.550 align:middle line:84%
have the maximized utility
at the next to last date

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:04.810 align:middle line:84%
because we've already
solved that problem.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:07.260 align:middle line:84%
And then you move to
the third to last date.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:09.510 align:middle line:84%
But it's still going to look
like a two period problem

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:12.000 align:middle line:84%
because we've collapsed
the last date and the next

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.380 align:middle line:84%
to the last date into one
because we already solved

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:18.840 align:middle line:90%
that last two period problem.

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show
you some notation.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:24.870 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure you could
possibly be following me.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.520 align:middle line:84%
But I'll say it
in English first.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:29.190 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll do
it in the notation.

00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:33.900 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, there's a sequence
of two period problems.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:38.490 align:middle line:84%
As you let the horizon
t get larger and larger,

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.730 align:middle line:84%
you're kind of farther and
farther away as you go back

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:43.830 align:middle line:90%
toward t equal 1.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:46.500 align:middle line:84%
So the larger is that
distance between t

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:51.060 align:middle line:84%
equal 1 and cap T. Especially
when beta is close to zero,

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:55.230 align:middle line:84%
it's as if you're solving
an infinite horizon problem.

00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:58.650 align:middle line:84%
And that is the way numerically
to solve it, literally.

00:41:58.650 --> 00:42:00.070 align:middle line:90%
Start with the last day.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:02.320 align:middle line:90%
Do the two period optimization.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:05.160 align:middle line:84%
So the next to the last to the
last, plug in the solution,

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:84%
move to the third
to last, and so on.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.240 align:middle line:90%
And then keep iterating forever.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, keep iterating
until the solution isn't

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:90%
changing anymore.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:16.350 align:middle line:84%
And then, amazingly,
you will be guaranteed

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.850 align:middle line:84%
to have solved the
infinite horizon problem.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:22.380 align:middle line:84%
So let me show you
the math of that.

00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:25.140 align:middle line:84%
And I apologize the
notation changes a bit.

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:27.690 align:middle line:84%
This is from engineering
or economics.

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:32.170 align:middle line:84%
It's called a control
problem, the Bellman problem.

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:36.330 align:middle line:84%
So x is the current state,
which in our application

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:40.650 align:middle line:84%
was the current harvest
plus the storage.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.800 align:middle line:84%
And y are the control
variables, namely,

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.160 align:middle line:84%
how much you can store
and save for tomorrow.

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.450 align:middle line:90%
That you get to choose.

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:50.670 align:middle line:90%
Also, you choose consumption.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:54.210 align:middle line:84%
You can choose two out of three,
that determines the third.

00:42:54.210 --> 00:42:57.360 align:middle line:84%
And then you'll get
beta times the utility

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.630 align:middle line:84%
for next year, which in this
control problem language

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:03.960 align:middle line:84%
is this so-called value
function which has in it

00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.140 align:middle line:84%
why the endogenous
variable chosen today

00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.860 align:middle line:84%
becomes the state of the
world for next period.

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:13.130 align:middle line:84%
So this is the two
period problem.

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:18.910 align:middle line:84%
Utility contemporary,
utility today, and utility

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:23.860 align:middle line:84%
next period, it's really already
maximized utility from tomorrow

00:43:23.860 --> 00:43:25.100 align:middle line:90%
on.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:26.785 align:middle line:84%
But think of it as a
two period problem.

00:43:26.785 --> 00:43:28.660 align:middle line:84%
That's the way I was
describing [INAUDIBLE]..

00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:30.910 align:middle line:84%
And what is the
overall solution?

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with J, the guess
about the next to last date,

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:37.940 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.500 align:middle line:90%
But T now, here's my apology.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:43.390 align:middle line:90%
T is not time.

00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:45.760 align:middle line:84%
T is the mapping in this
language of Bellman.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.100 align:middle line:84%
And I realized only
this morning that it

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.700 align:middle line:84%
might have been better to change
the notation to be consistent.

00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.970 align:middle line:84%
But T does not refer
to the time horizon.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:59.770 align:middle line:84%
T refers to the mapping from
the utility from next period

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.690 align:middle line:90%
on to the utility today.

00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:06.123 align:middle line:84%
This is the maximized
utility, where J is a given.

00:44:06.123 --> 00:44:08.290 align:middle line:84%
You're surely going to have
questions about this, so

00:44:08.290 --> 00:44:09.100 align:middle line:90%
interrupt me.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:11.770 align:middle line:84%
Now there's something called
a contraction mapping.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:13.990 align:middle line:84%
And don't worry about
the details here.

00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:17.920 align:middle line:84%
But it turns out we have
this mapping T here,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.210 align:middle line:84%
and we have the underlying
space being a metric m

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:25.030 align:middle line:84%
and we have some
distance metric,

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:28.330 align:middle line:84%
some way to measure distance
in that metric space.

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:34.120 align:middle line:84%
Then the difference between
two guesses about v times beta

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:40.700 align:middle line:84%
is an upper bound for the
distance between the result.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:47.140 align:middle line:84%
So, again, here we should think
about v1 and v2 as guesses

00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.530 align:middle line:90%
for the right-hand side.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.310 align:middle line:90%
So this would be J1 and J2.

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:56.860 align:middle line:84%
And then we apply T to it, and
this would be TJ instead of Tv.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.900 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably the
second thing to correct,

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.790 align:middle line:90%
is to change the v's to Js.

00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:03.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the point is
the distance over here

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.240 align:middle line:84%
on the left-hand side is
not greater, typically less

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.860 align:middle line:84%
than the distance on
the right-hand side.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.520 align:middle line:84%
And so intuitively what
that means is things

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.600 align:middle line:90%
are going to contract.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.790 align:middle line:84%
Hence this is called
a contraction mapping.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.630 align:middle line:84%
Or to put it more formally,
if you start with an arbitrary

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:24.790 align:middle line:84%
J or an arbitrary v, and
keep iterating, start here,

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:27.020 align:middle line:90%
get this, put it in.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:27.790 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:28.660 align:middle line:90%
Get this.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:29.860 align:middle line:90%
Do it again.

00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:36.070 align:middle line:84%
As N gets large, and we keep
successively applying that

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:39.610 align:middle line:84%
mapping to an initial
guess value of v,

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.790 align:middle line:84%
we're going to converge
to something called v*.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:47.770 align:middle line:84%
And when T of v* is
equal to v*, we are done.

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:50.050 align:middle line:84%
That's the infinite
horizon solution.

00:45:50.050 --> 00:45:55.450 align:middle line:84%
That's like saying the J up
here and the TJ is also J.

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:57.878 align:middle line:84%
So the time horizon
has disappeared.

00:45:57.878 --> 00:45:59.170 align:middle line:90%
So this is kind of tough stuff.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:01.212 align:middle line:84%
I thought it would be
better to show you the math

00:46:01.212 --> 00:46:03.110 align:middle line:84%
rather than be
mysterious about it.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:06.110 align:middle line:90%
But let me pause for questions.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:06.610 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:09.670 align:middle line:84%
We have everything we
needed in that application

00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:11.920 align:middle line:84%
to apply the
contraction mapping.

00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:15.130 align:middle line:84%
Our guess for v0 is
just the solution

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:16.810 align:middle line:90%
to the last period problem.

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:20.710 align:middle line:84%
We get the optimized value, as
if you were at the last date.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:23.860 align:middle line:84%
Substitute in the
maximized utility number.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:26.770 align:middle line:84%
And then go to the
next to the last period

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:30.400 align:middle line:84%
and iterate again with that
new guess for the second period

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.240 align:middle line:90%
utility.

00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And just keep
iterating, and we'll

00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:35.660 align:middle line:84%
get to the infinite
horizon solution.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:40.690 align:middle line:84%
So we can think about applying
this technique more generally.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:44.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is a related, but
somewhat distinct problem.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:49.150 align:middle line:84%
It's in a contemporary
setting, a household

00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:52.720 align:middle line:84%
trying to maximize the
utility of consumption,

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.500 align:middle line:84%
but facing stochastic earnings,
say, from year to year.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.500 align:middle line:84%
And they're limited in the
way that they can save.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.220 align:middle line:84%
But there is a savings account
in the bank at some interest

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:06.580 align:middle line:84%
rate, or even a riskless
bond, like treasuries.

00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.350 align:middle line:84%
So it's like putting
stuff in the ground

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:10.480 align:middle line:84%
today and getting
stuff out tomorrow.

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.780 align:middle line:90%
That's like storage.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:14.170 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the first
lecture, I said something

00:47:14.170 --> 00:47:16.810 align:middle line:90%
about these agrarian metaphors.

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:18.130 align:middle line:90%
And we just jump like that.

00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:22.240 align:middle line:84%
We went from grain in the bin
as kind of a storage technology

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:27.430 align:middle line:84%
to riskless bonds as another
way to store money over time,

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:29.230 align:middle line:90%
hopefully with a positive yield.

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Actually, the real rates
are negative right now.

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:35.270 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, that's
a bit of a problem.

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:38.380 align:middle line:90%
So we maximized utility.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:41.980 align:middle line:84%
And now I have the courage
to put infinite horizon here.

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:45.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to maximize
discounted expected utility

00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.200 align:middle line:90%
over the infinite horizon.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:49.180 align:middle line:90%
Beta is still less than one.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.600 align:middle line:90%
This thing would converge.

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.750 align:middle line:90%
So this term is finite.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:55.270 align:middle line:84%
And the choice will be
over how much to eat

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:56.590 align:middle line:90%
and how much to save.

00:47:56.590 --> 00:47:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So the way to
think about this is

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:01.300 align:middle line:84%
you're coming in
with a realization

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:03.040 align:middle line:90%
of your stochastic income.

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.070 align:middle line:84%
You're having the
amount of the bond

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:08.080 align:middle line:90%
that you bought last period.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.430 align:middle line:84%
You get that back plus
the interest rate.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:13.840 align:middle line:84%
That's the resources
available today at T.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:17.290 align:middle line:84%
And you can either eat
that, or buy a bond

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.340 align:middle line:84%
and carry it over
to the next period.

00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:22.690 align:middle line:84%
So this looks really similar to
the medieval storage problem.

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:27.220 align:middle line:84%
A couple of comments about
it, as I tried to alert you.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.250 align:middle line:90%
The timing here is the date.

00:48:30.250 --> 00:48:31.990 align:middle line:90%
The dating is different.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.780 align:middle line:84%
So now, at t, this is no
longer a state variable.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.240 align:middle line:84%
This is a decision
variable, bonds

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.650 align:middle line:90%
to becoming due next period.

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:42.820 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, on the right-hand
side, this doesn't have a t.

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.140 align:middle line:90%
It had a t minus 1.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.860 align:middle line:84%
Because the savings decisions
are dated at the time t

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.770 align:middle line:84%
that you make the decision,
rather than the time

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:52.870 align:middle line:90%
t where the yield comes in.

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:54.430 align:middle line:90%
And this is also standard.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:56.500 align:middle line:84%
You just have to keep an
eye out in terms of what

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.330 align:middle line:90%
the authors have in mind.

00:48:58.330 --> 00:49:01.060 align:middle line:90%
And this starts at date zero.

00:49:01.060 --> 00:49:03.710 align:middle line:84%
So you need some
initial conditions,

00:49:03.710 --> 00:49:09.010 align:middle line:84%
which should have been k at
t equals 0 minus 1 or k1.

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.660 align:middle line:90%
This is also a typo.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:14.380 align:middle line:84%
This should have been
k minus 1, not k0.

00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.880 align:middle line:90%
And the y0 is fine.

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.690 align:middle line:90%
That's the contemporary yield.

00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:19.660 align:middle line:84%
So I apologize
about these typos.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.670 align:middle line:84%
Although it is kind of
an interesting story.

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:23.560 align:middle line:90%
They're not mine.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.670 align:middle line:84%
I took this slide
from somebody else,

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:27.460 align:middle line:84%
and they had actually
made the mistake,

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.660 align:middle line:84%
and it wasn't corrected
in the publication.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.040 align:middle line:90%
But we'll fix it.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.905 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
about the typos--

00:49:32.905 --> 00:49:35.770 align:middle line:84%
I know you hate them,
I do, too-- when

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:39.400 align:middle line:84%
we did that input-output
matrix for Leontief last,

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:41.800 align:middle line:84%
when we did the
last part of lecture

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:44.710 align:middle line:84%
before the first part of
last lecture, the beginning

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:47.830 align:middle line:84%
of Lecture 5, we went
back over Lecture 4,

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:51.790 align:middle line:84%
and I was saying how much
of the service sector

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:53.530 align:middle line:90%
you need as an input.

00:49:53.530 --> 00:49:55.480 align:middle line:84%
Produce one unit of
output of services.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.670 align:middle line:84%
How much do you need
from manufacturing

00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:58.840 align:middle line:90%
and raw materials?

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.400 align:middle line:90%
It was right in the slide.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.930 align:middle line:90%
The typo had been corrected.

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:04.270 align:middle line:84%
But that typo
exists in Wikipedia.

00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:05.720 align:middle line:90%
And it's still wrong there.

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.900 align:middle line:84%
So what I'm saying
is, I work very

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:09.310 align:middle line:90%
hard to eliminate the typos.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:11.140 align:middle line:84%
But sometimes,
they still persist.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:14.410 align:middle line:84%
If you're reading carefully,
though, you can spot them.

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:17.020 align:middle line:84%
And please don't hesitate,
if you find other things

00:50:17.020 --> 00:50:18.160 align:middle line:90%
that you find questionable.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.390 align:middle line:90%
That's the bad part.

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:22.880 align:middle line:84%
Then it becomes confusing about
whether there's a typo or not.

00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:24.520 align:middle line:90%
So if in doubt, ask us.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:28.690 align:middle line:84%
And we'll try to
answer questions.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:33.340 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Here, the kt
could be [INAUDIBLE],, right?

00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:38.470 align:middle line:84%
in the latter constraint,
and say that a kt just

00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:41.782 align:middle line:90%
are larger than minus k?

00:50:41.782 --> 00:50:43.240 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Oh, good question.

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:47.560 align:middle line:90%


00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:50.240 align:middle line:90%
So borrowing is allowed.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So I referred to this
as a riskless bond,

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.300 align:middle line:90%
as if you could save.

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.930 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, if savings is
negative, you're borrowing.

00:50:59.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:middle line:90%


00:51:02.940 --> 00:51:08.420 align:middle line:84%
So if you multiplied through
by the negative sign,

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:13.360 align:middle line:84%
you'd have a minus kt less
than or equal to k bar.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.330 align:middle line:84%
So kt positive for
savings minus kt

00:51:16.330 --> 00:51:20.110 align:middle line:90%
would be now denoting borrowing.

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And borrowing has an
upper bound, a lower bar.

00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.850 align:middle line:84%
So this formulation of the
problem allows borrowing,

00:51:29.850 --> 00:51:30.675 align:middle line:90%
but it's limited.

00:51:30.675 --> 00:51:33.815 align:middle line:90%


00:51:33.815 --> 00:51:34.940 align:middle line:90%
So that's a great question.

00:51:34.940 --> 00:51:35.815 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for asking.

00:51:35.815 --> 00:51:36.880 align:middle line:90%
Is it clear?

00:51:36.880 --> 00:51:38.630 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:42.580 align:middle line:84%
Another question is,
what is the difference

00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:46.180 align:middle line:84%
between the self-insurance
and full insurance?

00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:49.760 align:middle line:84%
Is the self-insurance--
that means we cannot borrow,

00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:53.560 align:middle line:84%
or we can borrow, but there
were some constraints like this.

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:58.490 align:middle line:84%
We can borrow at a
certain range, or--

00:51:58.490 --> 00:52:01.005 align:middle line:90%


00:52:01.005 --> 00:52:02.880 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
so I actually took out

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.305 align:middle line:90%
slides that I used to have.

00:52:04.305 --> 00:52:08.230 align:middle line:90%


00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:10.000 align:middle line:84%
Self-insurance is
what we've been

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.140 align:middle line:90%
studying the whole lecture.

00:52:11.140 --> 00:52:14.470 align:middle line:84%
Because it's, like, one
village, or one person.

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And they're pretty
much in isolation.

00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:20.800 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's still
self-insurance, although there

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:24.730 align:middle line:84%
is this bond, or this borrowing
possibility at a fixed interest

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:27.250 align:middle line:84%
rate, which I didn't tell
you where that came from.

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:30.680 align:middle line:84%
But this is, like, partial
equilibrium problem

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:33.650 align:middle line:84%
in which the agent
can borrow or lend

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:37.370 align:middle line:90%
with the rest of the economy.

00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:40.520 align:middle line:84%
And that's still referred to as
self-insurance, although it's

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.910 align:middle line:90%
a bit misleading.

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:48.440 align:middle line:84%
Because one person's saving
is another person's borrowing.

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:51.120 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, we're not doing
the general equilibrium here.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.280 align:middle line:84%
We're taking-- the
interest rate is given.

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:58.100 align:middle line:84%
But the other thing
would be, what

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:02.110 align:middle line:84%
if there were multiple
people like this,

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:06.880 align:middle line:84%
and some people had high
income at a given date,

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.650 align:middle line:84%
and other people had low
income at a given date?

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:14.590 align:middle line:84%
Then we're back
to thinking about

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:16.945 align:middle line:84%
whether they could make
deals with each other.

00:53:16.945 --> 00:53:20.860 align:middle line:90%


00:53:20.860 --> 00:53:24.490 align:middle line:84%
So we'll get there
actually next time.

00:53:24.490 --> 00:53:28.770 align:middle line:84%
But the risk-sharing
problem would be--

00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:31.560 align:middle line:84%
an extreme version
of that is get rid

00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:34.020 align:middle line:84%
of the storage
altogether and the seed.

00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:34.698 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of them.

00:53:34.698 --> 00:53:36.240 align:middle line:84%
Not the seed, get
rid of the storage.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.130 align:middle line:90%
Get rid of the bond.

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:41.130 align:middle line:84%
But imagine these guys can
contract with each other,

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:45.030 align:middle line:84%
write financial contracts,
or informal risk-sharing

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:47.970 align:middle line:84%
arrangements with
each other so as

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:50.400 align:middle line:84%
to pool the risk
that they're facing.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:54.080 align:middle line:90%


00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:58.110 align:middle line:84%
Like in the village, they
had scattered those strips.

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:02.450 align:middle line:84%
So they're trying to stabilize
their starting point.

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:05.330 align:middle line:84%
But on top of it, they could
be borrowing and lending.

00:54:05.330 --> 00:54:08.780 align:middle line:90%
They could be making a deal.

00:54:08.780 --> 00:54:12.140 align:middle line:84%
If I'm high and you're low, I'll
give you money, and likewise,

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:14.430 align:middle line:90%
vice versa.

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:17.120 align:middle line:90%
And that's not self-insurance.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:21.710 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of dynamics
of explicit risk-sharing

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:22.580 align:middle line:90%
insurance.

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:26.350 align:middle line:90%


00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:27.340 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:27.790 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:54:27.790 --> 00:54:29.090 align:middle line:90%
No, it's a great question.

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:32.530 align:middle line:84%
As I said, I used to have
more slides here about that.

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:36.400 align:middle line:84%
And I thought it was a little
too early in the class.

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:39.025 align:middle line:84%
But there are clearly
trade offs about--

00:54:39.025 --> 00:54:42.950 align:middle line:90%


00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:45.170 align:middle line:84%
how can I put this--
whether or not

00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:48.590 align:middle line:84%
want to do self-insurance
as in a dynamic problem

00:54:48.590 --> 00:54:55.550 align:middle line:84%
versus whether or not
want to do risk sharing,

00:54:55.550 --> 00:54:59.800 align:middle line:84%
but do it repeatedly
over many dates.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:05.850 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the very first lecture,
after we did economic science,

00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:10.190 align:middle line:84%
we went through some
example economies.

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:12.100 align:middle line:90%
And I gave you five of them.

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:15.790 align:middle line:84%
And the very first two
were one, medieval villages

00:55:15.790 --> 00:55:17.740 align:middle line:84%
with these scattered
strips that we've

00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:27.170 align:middle line:84%
been studying now, last time and
today, implicitly, or the Thai

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.920 align:middle line:90%
temple scheme.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.720 align:middle line:84%
You remember the
Thai temple scheme?

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:32.630 align:middle line:90%
They had low land and high land.

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:35.210 align:middle line:84%
If the monsoon rains
were really abundant,

00:55:35.210 --> 00:55:37.910 align:middle line:84%
the low land flooded
too much, and they only

00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:40.130 align:middle line:90%
got crops off the high land.

00:55:40.130 --> 00:55:42.810 align:middle line:84%
And when the monsoon rains
were adequate or low,

00:55:42.810 --> 00:55:44.810 align:middle line:90%
then the highlands failed.

00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:49.070 align:middle line:84%
And what they did was contribute
their crops to the monks.

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Not for eating, that
really threw me.

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:54.920 align:middle line:90%
Because I know monks don't--

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.840 align:middle line:84%
I mean, you can feed the monks,
but the monks don't feed you.

00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.700 align:middle line:84%
But nevertheless, they
were putting their crops

00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:05.390 align:middle line:84%
under the auspices of
the temple with the monks

00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:07.580 align:middle line:84%
and then handing it
out to people that

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:11.800 align:middle line:90%
had either drought or flood.

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.200 align:middle line:84%
So that's an active
risk-sharing scheme.

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:18.090 align:middle line:84%
And your question
comes back to that,

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:21.290 align:middle line:84%
which is comparing and
contrasting these two

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:22.985 align:middle line:90%
different ways to handle risk.

00:56:22.985 --> 00:56:25.960 align:middle line:90%


00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.525 align:middle line:90%
OK, so this is Lecture 6.

00:56:30.525 --> 00:56:32.150 align:middle line:84%
There aren't quite
as many slides here.

00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:35.240 align:middle line:84%
But you can see there are
some very important concepts.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.060 align:middle line:84%
And we've now succeeded
in having both time

00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:43.070 align:middle line:84%
and uncertainty and dynamic
programming techniques

00:56:43.070 --> 00:56:43.950 align:middle line:90%
for solving that.

00:56:43.950 --> 00:56:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So we'll come back and
use those techniques

00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.390 align:middle line:90%
in subsequent lectures.

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:55.850 align:middle line:84%
Next Tuesday is a lecture
on Pareto optimality, which

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:58.580 align:middle line:84%
is finally the full blown
general equilibrium,

00:56:58.580 --> 00:57:00.920 align:middle line:84%
although we've kind of
been going back and forth

00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:03.540 align:middle line:84%
and getting very close to that
in the last couple of lectures.

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:06.350 align:middle line:84%
But in the lecture
on Tuesday, we

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:09.980 align:middle line:84%
will fully embrace it and
talk about efficiency.

00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:12.730 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's all for today.

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:19.000 align:middle line:90%

LORNA GIBSON: So last
time, we finished

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.780
talking about trabecular bone.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.680
And what I wanted to
talk about this week

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.782
was tissue
engineering scaffolds.

00:00:33.782 --> 00:00:35.240
So the idea with
tissue engineering

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.730
is you want to be able to repair
damaged or diseased tissue.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.190
And typically, that's done
by regenerating the tissue

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.120
in some way.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.520
So in your body, many types
of cells, like maybe not blood

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.940
cells, but most types of cells
for sort of structural tissues

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.200
are attached to an
extracellular matrix.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.870
And this is sort of a schematic
of the extracellular matrix

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.460
here.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.960
And the composition depends
on the type of tissue

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.030
that's involved.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.890
For example, in skin, it would
be collagen and something

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.050
called glycosaminoglycans
and elastin.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.120
In bone, it would be collagen
and a mineral-- a calcium

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.550
phosphate mineral,
hydroxyapatite.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.640
So the composition varies.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.780
But the idea with the
tissue engineering scaffold

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.240
is that you want to make a
material that essentially

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.270
substitutes for the
extracellular matrix.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.240
And it does so on a
sort of temporary basis.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.430
So the idea is you put
something in the body.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.930
The cells attach to that,
whatever scaffold you put in.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.820
And the scaffold has to
be made in such a way

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.440
that the material--
that the cells, they

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.460
can migrate through it.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.390
They can attach to it.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.450
They can differentiate.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.160
They can proliferate.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.420
So the cells can do all
their normal function.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.040
And the idea is that
as the cells are

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.000
doing their normal
function, they then

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.710
secrete the natural
extracellular matrix.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.640
And the engineered thing
that you put in is resorbed.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.510
So there has to be a balance
between the rate at which

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.260
the scaffold you've made resorbs
and the rate at which the cells

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.510
are depositing the new
native extracellular matrix.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.320
So that's one of the
key things about this.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.680
So this is just an example
of sort of a schematic

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.460
of an extracellular matrix.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.330
In this case here,
there's collagen fibers.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.030
So these guys here
collagen fibers.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.780
And these kind of hairy-looking
things are proteoglycans.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.550
So they have a core of
protein with sugars kind

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.880
of hanging off of them.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.400
And there's different kinds
of GAGs, they're called,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.120
that hang off of them.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.850
So one's chondroitin sulfate.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.930
The CS here stands for
Chondroitin Sulfate.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.326
There's one called
dermatan sulfate.

00:02:36.326 --> 00:02:37.950
And there's one called
heparin sulfate.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.410
So there's different of
these glycosaminoglycans.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.400
So let me write
down some of this,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.960
and then we'll kind
of get into this.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.501
So what I wanted to
do today was show

00:02:46.501 --> 00:02:50.090
you some examples of tissue
engineering scaffolds.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.717
Show you some of the sort
of design requirements.

00:02:52.717 --> 00:02:55.050
So you have to have, obviously,
a material that's porous

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.300
so the cells can get in there.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.822
And that's where the
cellular solids comes in.

00:02:59.822 --> 00:03:01.280
So we'll talk about
some scaffolds,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.800
some of the sort of design
requirements for them.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.600
And also, we'll
talk a little bit

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.420
about processing
of the scaffolds

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.570
and mechanical properties
of the scaffolds.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.260
So I'm hoping I can
finish most of that today.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.220
And then next time, I
have a little case study

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.460
on osteochondral scaffolds.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.480
So osteo means bone.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.150
And the chondral
means cartilage.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.070
So this was sort of
a two-layer scaffold

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.974
that we developed
in collaboration

00:03:22.974 --> 00:03:25.390
with some other people at MIT
and some people at Cambridge

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.870
University.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.990
And it went from a research
thing to a startup thing

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.650
and being used clinically.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.640
So I was going to talk
about that Wednesday.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:35.180
OK.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.346
So let me just get started here.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.670
So the goal of
tissue engineering

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.390
is to regenerate diseased
or damaged tissues.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.530
And in the body,
the cells attach

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.570
to the extracellular matrix.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.585
And that's sometimes
called the ECM.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.960
Sometimes, the scaffolds
are called scaffolds.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.550
And sometimes,
they're called matrix

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.740
because the extracellular
matrix is called matrix.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:12.190
So then, the composition of
the ECM depends on the tissue,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.447
but it usually involves some
sort of structural protein.

00:05:15.447 --> 00:05:17.030
So something like
collagen or elastin.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.100
It also typically involves
some sort adhesive proteins.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.823
So something like
fibronectin or laminin.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.130
And it involves
these proteoglycans,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:58.158
which are the core of protein
with a sugar hanging off them.

00:05:58.158 --> 00:05:58.658
Whoops.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:43.020
And the sugars are typically
glycosaminoglycans.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.650
And for short, people call them
GAGs, just because it's easier

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.201
to say.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.043
So some examples of the GAGs
are chondroitin sulfate.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.900
And we're going to talk more
about that a little later

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.260
because that's one
that we've used

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.110
in making collagen-based
scaffolds with [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:40.890
So for example, if you
look at the composition

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:44.960
of extracellular matrix in
something like cartilage,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.760
it has a collagen component
and a hyaluronic acid component

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.630
and some GAGs.

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:08.710
And this hyaluronic
acid is a proteoglycan.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.608
If you look at bone,
extracellular matrix in bone,

00:08:19.608 --> 00:08:21.733
it's made up mostly of
collagen and hydroxyapatite.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:38.111
And if you look at skin, skin
is made up of collagen, elastin,

00:08:38.111 --> 00:08:38.860
and proteoglycans.

00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:51.800
And the idea is
that the cells have

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.920
to be attached to this
extracellular matrix

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:55.610
in order to function.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.030
Or, they have to be attached to
this or to other cells in most

00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.530
cases.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.100
So next week, I'm going to talk
a bit about cell mechanics.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.480
And we have some
video where we watch

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:49.050
a cell deforming a scaffold.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.880
And I don't have
videos to show you,

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.540
but I had a student who took
videos of cells migrating along

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.300
with scaffolds.

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:58.320
We'll look at how the
stiffness of the scaffold

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.361
affects how the cells
migrate along the scaffold.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:09.910
So that's kind of the
native ECM in the body.

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:11.860
And the idea with
tissue engineering

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.290
is that you want to
make a scaffold that's

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.520
porous that mimics
the extracellular

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.720
matrix in the body.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.110
So, say, there's some
tissue that's damaged.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.030
Say there's damaged cartilage.

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.050
You want to provide sort
of an extracellular matrix

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:26.880
that's a sort of
synthetic thing that's

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.090
going to provide the
same function as the ECM

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.150
in the native tissue.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.000
So people have been working
on scaffolds for regenerating

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.410
all sorts of different tissues.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.190
And probably, the
most successful one

00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:06.530
has been used to
regenerate skin.

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.030
And there's been
scaffolds available

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.550
for regenerating skin for
probably almost 20 years now.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.230
And one of the first
ones was developed

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:15.150
by Professor Yannas in
mechanical engineering

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.960
here at MIT.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.200
And it's actually still sold
by a company called Integra.

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:51.950
But this research
to develop scaffolds

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:55.270
for lots of different tissues,
orthopedic tissues, things

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:59.480
like bone and cartilage,
cardiovascular tissues,

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.600
nerve-- like Professor Yannas
works on peripheral nerve

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.680
these days.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.820
People have looked at
trying to make scaffolds

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:08.430
for gastrointestinal tissues.

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.040
So all sorts of
different tissues.

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.240
And at MIT, there's quite
a lot of interest in this.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.320
There's a lot of
people working on it.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.530
So Bob Langer works on it.

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.570
Linda Griffith.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.070
Sangeeta Bhatia.

00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.963
There's really quite a number
of people at MIT who work on it.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.200
Those are just some
of the people at MIT.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.380
So the idea is in
the body, the cells

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.700
are constantly resorbing
the extracellular matrix

00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.050
and depositing more.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.850
So if you think about
bone, for example.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:32.760
Remember we said bone
grows in response to load?

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.290
Even in healthy bone, the bone
is constantly being resorbed

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.610
and deposited.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:40.170
And in normal bone,
the rate of resorption

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.874
and the rate of deposition
is roughly the same.

00:13:42.874 --> 00:13:45.040
When people get osteoporosis,
the thing that happens

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.080
is that that balance
gets out of whack.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.070
And so it's not being
deposited at the same rate

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:50.990
it's being resorbed.

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.800
And the idea with the
tissue engineering scaffolds

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.460
is that they degrade over time.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.200
And that the cells that
were attached to them

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.440
are forming their own
extracellular matrix.

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.240
So there's kind
of a balancing act

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.784
between the cells
depositing the native ECM

00:14:25.784 --> 00:14:27.450
and the tissue
engineering scaffold that

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:32.490
was provided, say, by the
clinician being resorbed.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.170
So the scaffolds are
actually designed to degrade.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:36.930
And controlling that
degradation rate

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.190
is one of the design
parameters of the scaffolds.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:34.780
OK.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.470
So that's kind of the
overall, kind of big picture.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.140
And what I wanted
to talk about next

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.896
was some design requirements
for the scaffolds.

00:15:42.896 --> 00:15:44.270
So if you think
about it, there's

00:15:44.270 --> 00:15:47.700
different sort of ways
you can think about what

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.620
the requirements are.

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.867
So you have to make the
scaffold out of some solid.

00:15:50.867 --> 00:15:52.700
And there's some
requirements for the solid.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:55.100
So obviously, you want a
solid that's biocompatible.

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.750
That's one kind of
main requirement.

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:00.220
Another requirement is
that not only the solid has

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:04.220
to be biocompatible, but
when the solid decomposes,

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.740
if it decomposes into
other components,

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.390
they have to be
biocompatible too.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.840
So you don't want the solid to
degrade during this resorption

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.760
process into toxic components.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:15.267
That would be a bad idea.

00:16:15.267 --> 00:16:16.850
And then, the other
thing is the solid

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.730
itself has to promote
cell attachment, and cell

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.630
proliferation, and
cell migration, all

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:24.090
these kinds of things.

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:26.460
So we're going to talk about
some different materials

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.210
for the scaffolds.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.110
And some of them are
sort of native proteins.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.530
So some of them are things
like collagen. Collagen already

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.110
has binding sites for
cells to attach to it.

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:39.050
Obviously, it's one of the
proteins in the native ECM.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:41.849
There's also a number of
synthetic polymers you can use.

00:16:41.849 --> 00:16:43.390
And with the synthetic
polymers, they

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:46.420
don't have natural binding
sites for the cells.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.582
And so you have to coat
them with something else.

00:16:48.582 --> 00:16:50.915
So you have to coat them with,
say, adhesive proteins so

00:16:50.915 --> 00:16:53.150
that the cells will
attach to them.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.776
So we're going to talk about
the requirements for the solid.

00:16:56.776 --> 00:16:58.400
Then, you make the
solid into some sort

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.650
of porous, foamy thing.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.260
I think I have some slides here.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.430
Here's an example of a
collagen GAG scaffold.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.200
And this is one of the ones
that is made in Yannas' lab.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.119
And you can see it
looks a lot like a foam.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:11.790
It's very, very porous.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.710
And there's some
requirements for the sort

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.800
of cellular structure, the
foamy structure of the scaffold

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:17.839
as well.

00:17:17.839 --> 00:17:20.819
So typically, you want
interconnected pores

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.849
so it's easy for the
cells to migrate in.

00:17:23.849 --> 00:17:26.964
Typically, you want pores to
be within a certain range.

00:17:26.964 --> 00:17:28.630
It turns out if the
pores are too small,

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.550
it makes it difficult
for the cells to get in.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.530
Sometimes, they can by
eating away at the material.

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.550
But typically, the pores--
you want them to be bigger

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:37.700
than a certain size.

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.100
You also want them to be
smaller than a certain size

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.580
because how much specific
surface area, how much surface

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.840
area per unit volume you've
got, depends on the pore size.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.170
The smaller the pores,
the more surface area

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:50.789
per unit volume you have.

00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:52.330
And then, the number
of binding sites

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:53.950
you have for cells
to attach to it

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:56.080
depends on that
specific surface area.

00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:58.880
I'm going to write all
this down, so I'll do that.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.344
So there's requirements for
sort of the pore structure.

00:18:02.344 --> 00:18:04.010
And then, there's
also some requirements

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:05.325
for the whole scaffold itself.

00:18:05.325 --> 00:18:06.700
So for instance,
it's got to have

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.924
some minimal
mechanical integrity.

00:18:08.924 --> 00:18:10.840
So there's sort of some
requirements for that.

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.820
So there's requirements
for the solid.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.890
There's requirements for the
sort of cellular structure,

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:16.920
the porous structure.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.530
And there's requirements
for the overall scaffold.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.973
So let me write some
of these things down.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.710
So there's some
requirements for the solid.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:43.876
So it must be biocompatible.

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.284
It must also promote cell
attachment and proliferation

00:18:57.284 --> 00:18:58.200
in the cell functions.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.620
And then it must degrade
into nontoxic components.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:26.080
So there's some requirements
for the cellular structure, too.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.690
And what you want to have
is a large volume fraction

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:30.250
of interconnected pores.

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.080
And so you want that to
facilitate the cell migration.

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.785
And also, the transport of
nutrients into the cells.

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:44.762
So you also want the pore size
to be within a critical range.

00:22:44.762 --> 00:22:46.470
So you need the pores
bigger than a lower

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.979
limit so the cells can
migrate through easily,

00:22:48.979 --> 00:22:50.020
can kind of get in there.

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.640
And you want the pore size to
be less than an upper limit

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.080
to have enough surface area
to have enough binding sites

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.644
to actually attach cells.

00:22:56.644 --> 00:22:58.060
And for different
tissues, there's

00:22:58.060 --> 00:22:59.980
different critical
ranges of the pore size.

00:23:58.930 --> 00:24:02.620
So for example,
for skin they found

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:07.650
that you want to have a pore
size between about 20 microns

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:10.170
and about 150 microns.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:18.375
And for bone, the pore sizes
that people tend to use

00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:22.075
are between about
100 and 500 microns.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:26.900
So there's the pore size.

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:29.500
And one other feature is
that the pore geometry should

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.870
be conducive for the cell type.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.190
So lots of cells are
somewhat equiaxed.

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:36.814
Maybe a little elongated.

00:24:36.814 --> 00:24:38.730
But if you look at
something like nerve cells,

00:24:38.730 --> 00:24:40.896
like peripheral nerve,
they're incredibly elongated.

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.380
So you want to have pores
in the scaffold that

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:44.580
are also very elongated.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.650
And then for the
overall scaffold,

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:38.320
it needs to have some
mechanical integrity.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:39.396
You guys OK?

00:25:39.396 --> 00:25:39.895
Yeah?

00:25:39.895 --> 00:25:42.380
We're good.

00:25:42.380 --> 00:25:43.090
Oh, achy.

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:43.950
Yeah.

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:47.300
I know.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.600
So you want to have some
overall mechanical integrity.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.090
I mean, the thing has to be
put into the body in surgery.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.610
And people are going to be
pushing and poking at it.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.500
And so it has to have some just
overall mechanical integrity.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.480
Also, it turns out that if you
put stem cells into scaffolds,

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.259
the types of cells
they differentiate into

00:26:03.259 --> 00:26:05.300
depends in part on the
stiffness of the scaffold.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.675
So you want to be
able to control

00:26:06.675 --> 00:26:07.940
the stiffness of the scaffold.

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:09.565
AUDIENCE: How do they
do this research?

00:26:09.565 --> 00:26:11.320
Do they use animals?

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.439
Or they do it in vitro?

00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:13.230
LORNA GIBSON: Yeah.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:15.350
So the question is, how
do they do the research?

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:18.240
So they do a sort of
series of different things.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:21.210
So at one level, you
could have the scaffold

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.700
and you'd put cells on it.

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:24.930
Say you're making
a bone scaffold.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:26.430
You'd put osteocytes onto it.

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.890
So one level, you just
put cells onto it.

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:31.950
And you want to see,
are the cells attaching?

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:33.220
Are they dying?

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:34.230
Are they proliferating?

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.060
So sometimes, what
people will do

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.630
is put the-- they'll seed
a certain number of cells

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:39.380
at a certain time.

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:40.730
Say, time 0.

00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:44.040
Then, they'll look at how
many cells are attached

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.930
at 24 hours or 48 hours.

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.640
And you kind of see
the cell attachment.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.610
You can measure
relatively easily.

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.130
Another thing people
do is animal studies.

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.650
So for instance,
Yannas does research

00:26:56.650 --> 00:26:58.390
on peripheral
nerves and scaffolds

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.670
for peripheral nerves.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.920
And they cut a piece out of
the sciatic nerve of rats.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.690
So obviously, they
have a surgeon

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:06.200
and do a surgery thing with it.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.950
You can't just kind
of do this in the lab.

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.830
You've got to get permissions
and stuff to do it.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.837
And then, they put
in the scaffold.

00:27:12.837 --> 00:27:14.420
And the scaffold's
actually in a tube.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:16.474
And so they put the two
stumps of the nerve end

00:27:16.474 --> 00:27:18.390
at either end of the
tube, and then the tube's

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.080
filled with a sort
of porous scaffold

00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:21.710
that we're talking about here.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.820
And then, they wait
some period of time.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:29.480
And they take video of rat
running, things like that.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.270
They then sacrifice the
rat and they do histology.

00:27:32.270 --> 00:27:34.220
And they look at the
sort of cross-sections

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.300
and see what it looks like.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.140
And so I'm going
to talk next time

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:41.890
about this osteochondral
scaffold we worked on.

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:43.740
So we did cell studies.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.850
We did goat studies.

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:46.540
We put into goat knees.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.700
There was a longer
term sheep study.

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.350
And then, the student who's
in Cambridge, England,

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.910
started up a company
and he ended up

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:58.090
getting approval in Europe
to start clinical trials.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:00.280
And then he worked with
an orthopedic surgeon who

00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.840
started putting it in people.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.470
But typically, they're looking
at cells, looking at animals

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:07.650
before you get to
the people stage.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.400
And one of the
things people do when

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.627
they're making
these scaffolds is

00:28:11.627 --> 00:28:13.210
you want to use
materials that already

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.560
have some sort of
regulatory approval.

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.094
So say FDA approval
or approval in Europe.

00:28:18.094 --> 00:28:20.510
So typically, people don't
start with a brand new material

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:21.150
from scratch.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:22.941
Because to get approval
for that would just

00:28:22.941 --> 00:28:25.340
take a very long time.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.310
So typically, people start
with-- the solid material

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:32.116
is already approved for
some other sort of use.

00:28:32.116 --> 00:28:33.490
OK.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.690
So one requirement for
the overall scaffold

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:40.711
is it has to have sufficient
mechanical integrity.

00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:41.210
Sufficient.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.770
And then also, as I mentioned,
the stiffness of the scaffold

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:14.060
can affect
differentiation of cells.

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.780
And the other thing
that is really

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.460
a factor for the
overall scaffold

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.600
is you want to control
the rate of degradation

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:31.700
of the overall scaffold.

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:34.060
So you want that
rate to be matched

00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:37.460
to the rate at which the
new tissue is forming.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.750
So it has to degrade
at a controllable rate.

00:30:44.381 --> 00:30:44.880
OK.

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:29.160
So I want to talk about the
materials that people use.

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.800
And you can kind of break
them down into a few classes.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.190
So one class is
natural polymers.

00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:35.600
So things like collage.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.140
So you can get collagen.
And that's an example up

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.620
there of a scaffold
that's made with collagen.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:44.200
Another class of materials
is synthetic biomaterials.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.114
And if you've had
stitches or surgery,

00:31:47.114 --> 00:31:49.030
you may know that some
of the sutures they use

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:49.812
are resorbable.

00:31:49.812 --> 00:31:51.270
So some of those
polymers that they

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:55.200
use for resorbable sutures
are also used for tissue

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.610
engineering scaffold.

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.610
And then, there's also hydrogels
that people use as well.

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.580
So those are probably
the three main groups

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:06.250
are sort of natural polymers,
synthetic biopolymers,

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:07.850
and I guess the
hydrogels are sort

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:09.750
of a subset of the
sympathetic biopolymers.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:23.930
So collagen is probably the most
common kind of natural polymer

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.500
that's used.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.200
They also use GAGs.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.900
And this scaffold
up here is made

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:33.070
by making a coprecipitative
collagen with a GAG chondroitin

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:34.280
sulfate.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.460
People also use alginate.

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:40.664
I think one of the
project groups--

00:32:40.664 --> 00:32:43.080
you guys are going to make
some sort of alginate scaffold,

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:43.910
right?

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:44.430
No?

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.500
[INAUDIBLE] foamy thing?

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:46.800
Yeah.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:50.730
And people also use
something called chitosan,

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:52.840
which is a derivative
of chiton, which

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:56.360
is what's in the exoskeleton
of insects and things

00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.370
like lobsters.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:00.690
So those would be all
examples of natural polymers

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:03.247
that can be used and
people have tried.

00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:05.080
I'm going to talk a bit
more about collagen,

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.180
just because it's
the most common one.

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.390
So collagen is a major component
in the natural extracellular

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:11.520
matrix.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.830
And not surprisingly, it
has binding sites for cells

00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:15.660
to attach to it.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:18.260
So if you use that, that kind
of takes care of that issue.

00:33:21.591 --> 00:33:22.590
Let me put it down here.

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.730
So collagen exists in
many types of tissues.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:43.460
Exists in skin.

00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:48.310
Exists in bone, cartilage,
ligament, tendon-- cartilage.

00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:58.260
So it's very common.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:03.470
It has surface binding
sites for cells.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.630
It has a relatively
low Young's modulus.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:43.110
So the Young's modulus is a
little less than a gigapascal.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:52.000
But you can increase the
modulus by either cross-linking

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.363
or by using it in conjunction
with some synthetic polymers.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.780
And I'm going to talk a
little bit about how you

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:25.890
make these scaffolds up here.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:28.680
And the first step in
making those scaffolds

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.760
is you put the collagen
in acetic acid,

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.610
and then you add the
glycosaminoglycan

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.430
and it forms a coprecipitate.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:36.620
And the fact that it
forms a coprecipitate

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:39.912
with the
glycosaminoglycan, the GAG,

00:35:39.912 --> 00:35:41.870
means that you can use
a freeze-drying process.

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:42.994
And that's how that's made.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:17.520
Collagen is one option.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.523
So then synthetic biopolymers
is another option.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.070
And as I said, typically
they use the materials

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.030
that are used for
resorbable sutures.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.350
So there's several of those.

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:53.490
There's something called PGA.

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:55.160
That's polyglycolic acid.

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.490
And something called PLA.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:05.835
That's polylactic acid.

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:14.660
And then you can combine
those two and make something

00:37:14.660 --> 00:37:18.380
called PLGA polylactic
co-glycolic acid.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:35.174
And you can control
the degradation rate

00:37:35.174 --> 00:37:37.340
of these things by controlling
the molecular weight.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.830
And in this case, you
can also control it

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:42.510
by controlling how much of each
of those things you put in.

00:38:10.731 --> 00:38:12.730
And there's another one
called polycaprolactone.

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:28.490
So those are several synthetic
biopolymers that people use.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:29.990
There's lots of
different materials,

00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:31.531
but these are just
some typical ones.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:09.130
And then another
class are hydrogels,

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.020
which are produced by
cross-linking water

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:13.857
soluble polymers to form
an insoluble network.

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.372
And those are typically
used for soft tissues.

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:56.940
Sometimes, they're used
for things like cartilage.

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.642
And again, there's a
few different materials

00:39:59.642 --> 00:40:00.600
that are commonly used.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.586
One's PEG, Polyethylene Glycol.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:15.565
One's PVA, Polyvinyl Alcohol.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:27.130
And another one's
PAA, Polyacrylic Acid.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.080
So for these synthetic
polymers, there's

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:39.179
many different processing
techniques available.

00:40:39.179 --> 00:40:40.720
And I'll talk a
little bit about some

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.940
of the processing techniques.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.370
But one of the
limitations is they don't

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:45.820
have natural binding sites.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.290
And you have to coat them with
some sort of binding agent,

00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:53.080
like an adhesive protein, to
get the cells to attach to them.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.900
And then, as I mentioned
before, you have to make sure

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:35.316
that whatever
material you choose,

00:41:35.316 --> 00:41:37.490
if it's a synthetic material
that when it degrades,

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:39.950
it's not toxic to the cells.

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:43.330
Because you don't want to have
some sort of toxic reaction

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:46.200
or inflammation.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:46.940
OK.

00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:50.670
So there's a couple more
things about materials.

00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:53.780
So those are all
polymer-based materials.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.770
When people are trying to
make scaffolds for bone tissue

00:41:56.770 --> 00:41:59.917
engineering, they also include
a calcium phosphate mineral.

00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:02.250
And there's different versions
of the calcium phosphate.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.250
So they can include-- you
can buy, for instance,

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:06.630
hydroxy powders now.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.230
There's another
calcium phosphate

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:12.040
called octacalcium phosphate,
which will, with water, turn

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.710
into hydroxyapatite.

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:16.410
So typically, there is this
mineral, some sort of calcium

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:18.239
phosphate, is combined
with either collagen

00:42:18.239 --> 00:42:20.030
or with one of these
synthetic biopolymers.

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:31.240
And one other
option is something

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.450
called an acellular scaffold.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:37.120
And what that is they
take some natural tissue

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.082
and they remove all the
cell material from it.

00:43:39.082 --> 00:43:41.540
And so when they remove all
the cell material, what they're

00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:43.510
left with is the native ECM.

00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:47.280
And that's called an
acellular scaffold.

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:52.960
So it's a native ECM with
all the cell matter removed.

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.900
And they remove
the cells by-- they

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:09.340
can use sort of a physical
agitation or chemical,

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.034
or using enzymatic methods.

00:44:11.034 --> 00:44:13.200
Using something like trypsin
to get rid of the cell.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.321
So there's ways that they
can get rid of the cells.

00:44:16.321 --> 00:44:16.820
OK.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.280
So are we good so far?

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.660
So there are some requirements
for what materials we

00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:22.670
kind of use, what the
cell structure should be,

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:25.242
and these are some examples
of typical materials.

00:44:25.242 --> 00:44:27.450
So I wanted to talk a little
bit about the processing

00:44:27.450 --> 00:44:30.599
of the materials.

00:44:30.599 --> 00:44:32.390
Let me wait until people
catch up a little.

00:44:39.942 --> 00:44:43.760
Oh, and I have some scaffolds
I was going to pass around.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:48.210
So this big sheet is a piece
of the collagen GAG scaffold

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:50.530
that I showed a minute ago.

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.230
And then this little piece is
a mineralized version of that.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:56.960
So this has the collagen
plus calcium phosphate

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.370
plus hydroxyapatite in it.

00:45:03.955 --> 00:45:04.650
OK.

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:08.100
So this slide shows some
examples of different scaffolds

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.201
that people have made.

00:45:09.201 --> 00:45:10.700
And I was going to
talk a little bit

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:11.867
about some of these methods.

00:45:11.867 --> 00:45:13.783
And why don't I talk
about them, and then I'll

00:45:13.783 --> 00:45:15.120
write some notes on the board.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.730
So this top one here on the top
left, that's the collagen GAG

00:45:18.730 --> 00:45:20.750
scaffold that's made
in Yannas' group.

00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:23.130
And that's made by a
freeze-drying process.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.280
So you put the collagen
in acetic acid,

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.630
then you put in the GAG.

00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:29.300
The GAG and the collagen
form a coprecipitate.

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.774
And then you can freeze that.

00:45:30.774 --> 00:45:32.190
And if you freeze
it, what happens

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.880
is-- it's just like if
you freeze saltwater.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:37.525
The water freezes.

00:45:37.525 --> 00:45:39.320
The pure water freezes.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:42.630
And you've got increasingly
higher brine content

00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:45.910
in the bit in between the water
grains, or in between the ice.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.160
So you get the sort
of solid ice forming.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.250
And the collagen and
the GAG are kind of

00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:54.677
squeezed into the interstitial
bits between the ice crystals.

00:45:54.677 --> 00:45:56.260
And then if you
sublimate the ice off,

00:45:56.260 --> 00:45:58.660
you're left with this
porous kind of structure

00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:00.150
that looks like a foam.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.680
So that's made by a
freeze-drying process.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:05.150
And I'll go over it in
a bit more detail when

00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:06.820
I write the notes on the board.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.050
You could also foam
some of these polymers.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:10.190
So just blowing a gas.

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.737
The same way you can blow a
gas through engineering foam.

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:15.820
You do the same thing with
some of these polymers.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:17.520
This one's made by foaming.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.640
You can have a
fugitive phase process.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.310
So this is made by salt
leaching, the second row

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:23.332
on the left there.

00:46:23.332 --> 00:46:25.540
So you could imagine you
could take a polymer powder.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:27.331
You could mix it with
salt. You can sort of

00:46:27.331 --> 00:46:28.910
mix them up, combine
them together.

00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.320
You heat it up to get the
polymer to melt and to sort

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.262
of form a connected mass.

00:46:34.262 --> 00:46:35.970
And then you leech
out the salt. And then

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:37.840
you get pores
where the salt was.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.670
This one here is made by
an electrospinning process.

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:41.620
So you have a nozzle.

00:46:41.620 --> 00:46:44.809
You feed the polymer
through the nozzle.

00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:46.350
Then you have plates
that are charged

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:49.650
and you get fibers forming
and kind of scattered

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.720
in different directions by
the electrospinning process.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:56.930
Then, this one here
represents scaffolds

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:02.980
that are made by things like
3D printing, selective laser

00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.560
centering.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:07.720
You can have
laser-sensitive polymer.

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.610
And you can produce
scaffolds that way.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:14.280
I think the geometry of this one
matches some part in the body.

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:16.750
I think it was a knee
or something like that.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.510
And then, these two
examples down here

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:19.950
are the acellular scaffolds.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.200
That's what I was talking
about at the very end there.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:25.250
So those are from porcine
pork heart tissue.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:26.980
You know, pig heart tissue.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.480
And those are mostly elastin.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.330
And they've had all the cell
matter removed from them.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:32.950
OK.

00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.990
So you can kind of see that
these synthetic scaffolds here

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:39.980
have a structure that's not so
different from these native ECM

00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:41.810
scaffolds down here.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:42.690
OK.

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:46.300
So let me write some of the
things about the processing

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.996
on the board.

00:47:48.996 --> 00:47:50.630
Let me rub this off.

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:51.720
Start over here.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:41.515
So these freeze-dried scaffolds
are used for skin regeneration.

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:05.620
And I think I have
some more slides here.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.610
So it's kind of a
two-step process.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:10.700
In the first step, you make
what they call a slurry.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.710
So you make the slurry
by taking the collagen.

00:49:13.710 --> 00:49:17.570
And for skin, I think you want
type 1 collagen. Yeah, skin

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:19.790
is type 1 collagen.
There's different types.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:23.580
You put it in acetic acid,
and then you add the GAG.

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:26.690
And we use chondroitin 6-sulfate
is just the particular GAG

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:27.820
that we use.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.870
And one of the things
that the acid does

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.430
is that it swells the
collagen. And collagen

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.220
has a sort of periodic
structure in it,

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:35.930
sort of periodic banding.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:38.880
And the acid destroys that
periodic banding structure.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:42.820
And that helps
increase the resistance

00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.100
to having some host
immune response.

00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:48.092
So that you remove the
immunological markers

00:49:48.092 --> 00:49:50.300
and it makes it less likely
that the scaffold's going

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.570
to get rejected by the body.

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:57.000
So then when you put the GAG
in, you form a coprecipitate.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.190
So this next step
just shows kind

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:00.980
of mixing the whole thing up.

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.880
And then you've got
kind of a little slurry

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:06.120
that you can store.

00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:08.320
And then, this is the
freeze-drying step here.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.170
So you put the slurry, the
suspension, into a pan.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:13.902
Kind of just like a
cookie sheet, really.

00:50:13.902 --> 00:50:14.860
And then you freeze it.

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:16.770
So if you think of
this phase diagram

00:50:16.770 --> 00:50:19.070
here, where you have
temperature and pressure.

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.290
So here we have liquid,
solid, and vapor.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:24.240
So if you start off at this
point here, you freeze it.

00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:26.920
So you've reduced
the temperature.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:28.640
So that forms the ice.

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:32.170
And the ice is surrounded by
the collagen and the GAG fibers.

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:34.002
And then if you do
the sublimation step,

00:50:34.002 --> 00:50:36.460
you reduce the pressure and
increase the temperature a bit.

00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:38.660
And then you get over to
the vapor end of the world.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.586
And then you're left with
this porous scaffold.

00:50:42.586 --> 00:50:43.460
And then, let me see.

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.790
Let me do one more step here.

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:48.290
And then you can control
the size of the pores

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:50.380
by controlling the
freezing temperature.

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.410
So the size of the
pores is exactly

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.160
related to the size of the
ice grains that are forming.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.720
And the faster it freezes,
the smaller the grains

00:50:58.720 --> 00:50:59.660
are going to be.

00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.140
And then, the smaller your
pore size are going to be.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:03.455
So you can control that.

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:13.920
The type 1 collagen is
mixed with acetic acid.

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:30.070
And it then swells the collagen
and disrupts periodic banding.

00:51:38.025 --> 00:51:40.890
And it removes
immunological markers.

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.400
And then you add the GAG,
the chondroitin 6-sulfate.

00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:37.427
And then that cross
links with the collagen

00:52:37.427 --> 00:52:38.510
and forms a coprecipitate.

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:54.877
And then you can freeze dry
that to get the porous scaffold.

00:53:06.930 --> 00:53:09.640
And typically, the relative
densities of these scaffolds

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.930
is very low.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:14.555
So typically,
they're 0.5% dense.

00:53:14.555 --> 00:53:16.640
The relative density is 0.005.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.560
So they're 99.5% air
and the rest of it's

00:53:19.560 --> 00:53:21.690
the collagen and the GAG.

00:53:21.690 --> 00:53:27.096
And the pore sizes are typically
between about 100 and 150

00:53:27.096 --> 00:53:27.595
microns.

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:33.000
And Yannas uses
the same scaffolds

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.250
for the nerve regeneration.

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:35.880
And he uses a
directional cooling.

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.960
And that then
elongates the pores,

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:40.830
so that-- the idea is that they
elongate so the nerves kind

00:53:40.830 --> 00:53:42.070
of grow along that length.

00:54:05.830 --> 00:54:06.870
So that's one way.

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:12.230
Another way is leaching
a fugitive phase.

00:54:21.890 --> 00:54:22.440
So let's see.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:23.961
I think-- yep.

00:54:23.961 --> 00:54:24.460
Here we go.

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:25.760
Back to there.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.030
So if you look at the one on
the second row on the left,

00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:32.490
that's done by using salt
as the fugitive phase.

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:33.490
People use other things.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:34.800
You can use wax.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.417
Paraffin wax works as well.

00:54:36.417 --> 00:54:38.000
So it doesn't have
to be salt. There's

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.208
different things you can use.

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:02.350
So you combine a
powder of the polymer

00:55:02.350 --> 00:55:12.210
with your fugitive
phase Say, salt.

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:16.830
Then, you heat it up to
get the polymer to bind.

00:55:16.830 --> 00:55:35.070
And then you leach out the salt.
So you can control the porosity

00:55:35.070 --> 00:55:37.220
by the volume fraction
of the fugitive phase,

00:55:37.220 --> 00:55:39.730
and then the pore size
by the size of whatever

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:40.976
the fugitive phase is.

00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.420
Another technique
is electrospinning.

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:57.000
The idea is you produce
fibers from a polymer solution

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:58.460
that you extrude
through a nozzle.

00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:01.750
And then you apply a
voltage across some plates

00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:02.840
to spin the fibers.

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:10.940
And then you get a
network of these fibers.

00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:12.816
And typically, their
micron-scale diameter.

00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:39.140
And the last method
I'm going to talk about

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:40.390
is rapid prototyping.

00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:42.730
So you can think of
using 3D printing.

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:47.940
Or you could use selective laser
centering or stereo lithography

00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.742
using a photo-sensitive polymer.

00:58:50.742 --> 00:58:52.450
So the idea is-- you
know how this works.

00:58:52.450 --> 00:58:55.540
You just build up layers of
solid, one layer at a time.

00:59:27.070 --> 00:59:29.380
And then you can make
complex geometries with that.

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:30.713
So that's one of the advantages.

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:45.800
If you wanted to make a part
to fit a particular place

00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:48.310
in the tissue, then
it's convenient

00:59:48.310 --> 00:59:50.530
that you can control the
geometry of the whole part.

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:28.540
OK.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:31.730
So that just kind of
summarizes very briefly,

01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:34.000
kind of how the tissue
engineering scaffolds

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.390
are meant to work, what
kinds of materials people

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:39.140
make them from, and a
few of the processes.

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.710
And there's many,
many processes.

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.392
These are just sort of
a few common processes.

01:00:43.392 --> 01:00:45.850
I wanted to talk a little bit
about the mechanical behavior

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:47.990
because that's
kind of what I do.

01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:50.765
And so this next plot just
shows a stress strain curve

01:00:50.765 --> 01:00:53.636
in compression for a
collagen GAG scaffold.

01:00:53.636 --> 01:00:55.010
And I'm hoping
that by now you're

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.070
getting the idea all of
these cellular materials

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.892
have this kind of
shape of a curve.

01:00:58.892 --> 01:01:01.350
So there's the same kind of
linear elastic regime, and then

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:02.840
a collapse plateau.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.220
These collagen things,
as you can imagine just

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.970
pressing them in
your hand, they fail

01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:09.060
by buckling, by
inelastic buckling.

01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:11.050
And then there's a
densification regime.

01:01:11.050 --> 01:01:15.600
So they look like all the other
kinds of curves that we've got.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.100
One of the things we've
done in the modeling

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.100
is typically in
the model, we want

01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:22.000
to be able to
calculate or measure

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.650
the modulus of the solid or
the strength of the solid

01:01:25.650 --> 01:01:27.200
from which the thing's made.

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.750
So [? Brendan ?] Harley
was one of my PhD students.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:33.660
And he took a little
microscope, cut a little strut.

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:34.870
The struts are very small.

01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:36.350
The pore size is 100 microns.

01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:39.040
So the struts are on that order.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.420
He glued one end of the
strut to a glass slide,

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.950
and then he used an AFM probe
to do a little bending test

01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:47.090
on that little strut.

01:01:47.090 --> 01:01:49.404
If he could measure the
deflection, he knew the length.

01:01:49.404 --> 01:01:50.820
He knew the geometry
of the strut.

01:01:50.820 --> 01:01:53.111
He could figure out what the
modulus was for the solid.

01:01:53.111 --> 01:01:55.160
So he backs out
what the modulus is.

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.120
So he did these
measurements on a dry strut.

01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.380
And then by comparing
the overall modulus

01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:04.850
of a dry scaffold
with a wet scaffold,

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:08.180
he estimated what the
modulus of the wet scaffold

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:09.590
or the wet strut would be.

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:11.850
So the modulus of
the dry collagen GAG

01:02:11.850 --> 01:02:14.190
was 672 megapascals.

01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:15.910
A little less than a gigapascal.

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:17.190
And wet it was about 5.

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:20.600
So there's a huge difference
between the wet and the dry.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.100
OK.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:23.440
So let me just write a
few notes about that.

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:54.832
So in compression,
there's the three regimes

01:02:54.832 --> 01:02:56.706
that we see for all
these cellular materials.

01:03:00.650 --> 01:03:04.380
And so you can estimate the
modulus by using the model

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.780
we have for the foam
for the modulus.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:10.050
The modulus of the foam divided
by the modulus of the solid

01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:13.340
goes as the relative
density squared.

01:03:13.340 --> 01:03:16.670
And that's related to
bending in the cell wall.

01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:20.330
And then, the collapse plateau
is related to elastic buckling.

01:03:20.330 --> 01:03:22.945
And so that's equal
to some constant times

01:03:22.945 --> 01:03:27.450
E of the solid times the
relative density squared.

01:03:27.450 --> 01:03:29.160
And that's related
to elastic buckling.

01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:41.940
And then we measured E of the
solid doing this little AFM

01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:42.990
beam bending test.

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:14.770
OK.

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.800
And for one of these
low-density scaffolds,

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:28.250
we measured the modulus.

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:29.940
We measured the
buckling strength.

01:04:29.940 --> 01:04:33.960
And we got pretty good agreement
by using these equations here.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:39.480
And the good agreement was
if this constant was 0.2.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.610
That was the strain,
that buckling.

01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:42.316
Yeah.

01:04:42.316 --> 01:04:46.316
AUDIENCE: So what does it
mean to be wet in here?

01:04:46.316 --> 01:04:50.520
And why is it so much lower?

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:52.850
LORNA GIBSON: Well,
we make the scaffolds

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:54.160
by this freeze-drying thing.

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.504
And like this thing I
passed around, that was dry.

01:04:56.504 --> 01:04:57.670
We just immerse it in water.

01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:58.890
We just put it in water.

01:04:58.890 --> 01:05:01.880
And then, he does the test.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.920
So he does the test on
the whole scaffold dry,

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.549
and then he does the test
on the whole scaffold wet.

01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:09.090
And I assume there's some sort
of bonding that gets disrupted

01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:10.210
by having the water.

01:05:10.210 --> 01:05:12.010
I don't know the details
of how that works,

01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:13.843
but there must be some
change in the bonding

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.070
to make that happen.

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:18.705
So let's see.

01:05:18.705 --> 01:05:19.582
I'm trying to see.

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:20.790
What else should we do today?

01:05:20.790 --> 01:05:21.290
Oh, yeah.

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:25.860
So we get pretty good
agreement with this sort

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.520
of simple foamy model.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:28.930
One of the things
we did find was

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:32.010
that when we tested
higher-density scaffolds,

01:05:32.010 --> 01:05:33.560
the agreement wasn't so good.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.260
And I think this was because
when you get higher density,

01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:40.060
it's just hard to get the
collagen GAG mixture to mix in

01:05:40.060 --> 01:05:41.090
with the acetic acid.

01:05:41.090 --> 01:05:43.500
And so we ended up getting
inhomogeneous scaffolds

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.270
with sort of large
voids in them.

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:46.940
So in order for the
modeling to work,

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:49.880
you have to have a scaffold
that's relatively homogeneous.

01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:53.110
You don't have kind
of big defects in it.

01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:56.400
I think that's all I'm
going to say about that.

01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.611
I have one more slide here.

01:06:00.611 --> 01:06:02.610
So those are sort of
three-dimensional scaffolds

01:06:02.610 --> 01:06:03.620
we've been talking about.

01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:04.786
Sort of foam-like scaffolds.

01:06:04.786 --> 01:06:07.070
People have also made
honeycomb-like scaffolds

01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:07.980
as well.

01:06:07.980 --> 01:06:09.510
And this just
shows some examples

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:12.170
of some honeycomb-type
scaffolds.

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:17.575
So this one here, I think was
made in Sangeeta Bhatia's lab.

01:06:17.575 --> 01:06:19.480
You can sort of think
of it as a hexagon,

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.180
but it's also kind of
triangulated as well.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.660
These two here were made
by George Engelmayr.

01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.910
He worked with Bob
Langer at one point.

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:30.940
And these two
scaffolds here, they're

01:06:30.940 --> 01:06:33.690
both sort of rectangular cells.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.850
And they were designed
to look at how

01:06:35.850 --> 01:06:38.650
the cell geometry
or the pore geometry

01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:42.117
affected the sort of morphology
of the cells that attached.

01:06:42.117 --> 01:06:43.950
So if you have different,
say, [? porous, ?]

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:46.120
you get different
morphology in the cells

01:06:46.120 --> 01:06:47.550
that you're trying to attach.

01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:50.720
And then, George Engelmayr
also made these scaffolds here.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:53.300
And those were designed
to be anisotropic and have

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:56.130
different mechanical properties
in different directions.

01:06:56.130 --> 01:06:57.590
And I think what
they had done was

01:06:57.590 --> 01:07:00.640
try to match the anisotropy
in the mechanical properties

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:03.990
to anisotropy in heart
tissue, in cardiac tissue.

01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:07.375
So these are some examples
of honeycomb-type scaffolds.

01:07:07.375 --> 01:07:09.500
So let me just write down
a few things about those.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.440
So I think these were
more-- obviously,

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.780
the scaffolds are
used-- the ultimate goal

01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.960
is to use them clinically.

01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.920
But sometimes, people
make scaffolds just

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:51.211
to study cell behavior.

01:07:51.211 --> 01:07:52.960
And some of these, I
think, were made just

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.793
to study how the cells
would behave on them.

01:07:54.793 --> 01:07:57.153
So they're sort of
idealized to do that.

01:08:21.310 --> 01:08:22.462
So that triangulated.

01:08:22.462 --> 01:08:24.540
It kind of looks like a
hexagon, but there's also

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:25.815
sort of triangles in there.

01:08:30.012 --> 01:08:31.470
I think the thing
they were looking

01:08:31.470 --> 01:08:36.834
at with that was transport
of nutrients to cells.

01:08:55.450 --> 01:08:58.370
And from a mechanical point
of view, if it's triangulated

01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:04.250
you'd expect, say, the
modulus of that to go linearly

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:06.670
with how much solid
there is there.

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.939
So the rectangular honeycomb
and the diamond shaped

01:09:26.939 --> 01:09:30.479
pores, they were used to study
the effect of pore geometry

01:09:30.479 --> 01:09:31.624
on the cell orientation.

01:09:31.624 --> 01:09:32.540
They used fibroblasts.

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.010
And I'm going to call it the
accordion-like honeycomb.

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:09.780
That's mechanically anisotropic.

01:10:09.780 --> 01:10:13.705
And the mechanical anisotropy is
matched to the cardiac tissue.

01:10:36.795 --> 01:10:37.770
OK.

01:10:37.770 --> 01:10:40.110
So I think I'm going to
stop there for today.

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:41.817
That's sort of the
end of this part.

01:10:41.817 --> 01:10:43.400
And next time, I'm
going to talk about

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.960
the osteochondral scaffolds.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.918
I don't think it really
makes sense to start it

01:10:46.918 --> 01:10:48.000
for two or three minutes.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.350
So I'll start that tomorrow.

01:10:49.350 --> 01:10:50.330
Or Wednesday.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:52.870
And we should be able to
finish that on Wednesday.

01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:57.160
So one of the things that these
honeycomb-type scaffolds kind

01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.950
of suggests is that
the scaffolds are

01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:02.160
used both to try to
regenerate tissue

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.210
in the body in
clinical applications,

01:11:04.210 --> 01:11:06.780
but they're also used as sort
of an environment for cells,

01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.739
in order to study cell behavior.

01:11:08.739 --> 01:11:10.280
So next time, I'm
going to talk about

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.549
an osteochondral scaffold.

01:11:11.549 --> 01:11:13.840
And the idea with that was
to try to use it clinically.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.830
But next week, I'm going to
talk about cell mechanics a bit.

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:18.690
And when people
study cell mechanics,

01:11:18.690 --> 01:11:21.920
or look at the mechanics
of biological cells, not

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.120
the cellular structures.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:28.510
So when people look at trying
to study how cells behave,

01:11:28.510 --> 01:11:30.260
they need some environment
to put them on.

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:33.930
Typically, people started by
just using flat 2D substrates.

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:36.909
But the flat 2D substrates
are kind of easy to study,

01:11:36.909 --> 01:11:39.200
but they don't really represent
the tissue in the body.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:42.140
And so people are now using
tissue engineering scaffold

01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:44.680
as an environment
that they can control

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.240
to study how cells behave.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.150
So they study cell attachment,
cell proliferation,

01:11:49.150 --> 01:11:51.760
cell migration, and
cell differentiation

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.210
all by using the
scaffolds as kind

01:11:53.210 --> 01:11:54.890
of a controlled environment.

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:56.800
So we'll talk about
that, probably not--

01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.675
I don't know if we'll
get to it on Wednesday.

01:11:58.675 --> 01:12:00.120
But we might start
it on Wednesday

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.710
and finish it next week.

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.260
OK?

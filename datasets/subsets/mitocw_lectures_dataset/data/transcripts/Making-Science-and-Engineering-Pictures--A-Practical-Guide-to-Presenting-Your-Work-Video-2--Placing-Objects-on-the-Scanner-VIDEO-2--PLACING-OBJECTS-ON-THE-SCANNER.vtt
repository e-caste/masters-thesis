00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.250
Take a look at this music
box for our first case study.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.190
So I place it on the
glass of the scanner,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.140
and it looks pretty good.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.790
But as I look carefully.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.300
Which I hope you will do when
you try this sort of stuff

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.340
with your work, a
couple of things

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.270
that I'm not thrilled with.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.090
First of all, we're seeing
some writing on the barrel.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.690
Looking closer, it appears
to be numbers and letters.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.820
That's not great.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.390
Our eyes go straight
to letters and numbers,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.140
and they basically
attract our eye

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.770
and actually become a
distraction from the image,

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.080
as far as I'm concerned.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.580
So I'm not happy with that.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.670
I'm also not thrilled with
the positioning of the turning

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.550
mechanism.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.820
Let's call it a stem.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.850
Somehow it doesn't
feel composed properly.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.970
So what I simply did, was I
played it a bit so the barrel

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.980
no longer shows the writing,
and I turned the stem

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.950
so that it landed in a
better composed image.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.740
I've been thinking
about composition

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.440
all my professional
life, so see if you can

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.880
agree with me on this decision.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.160
So I started thinking
about what difference

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.890
it would make if we changed
the orientation of the device

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.030
on the scanner.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.240
Now remember the light
and sensors travel

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.810
only in one direction we
have no control over that.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.980
So in this first image,
the barrel of the music box

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.550
is parallel to the light source.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.380
In the next image I decided
to rotate the music box

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.070
90 degrees, that
is, perpendicular

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.470
to the light source.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:39.220
Here's that image.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.820
Take a look at the
two side by side

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.500
and observe the difference.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.300
I'll let you think
about that for a bit.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.660
So you see the first image,
made with the barrel oriented

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.729
parallel to the light source,
has a significant highlight.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.820
Whereas the one
captured perpendicular

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.290
to the light source
has no highlight.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.800
If I sat down for
a bit and tried

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.620
to anticipate all these
results by drawing arrows

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.080
from light sources and
reflections and all that,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.600
I might have been able to
anticipate what the differences

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.760
would be in advance.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.760
But I would prefer to just
discover it, experiment

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.740
with it, just as I hope you
will do with your own material.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.800
And what it would look like if
I oriented the device about 45

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.579
degrees to the light source?

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.250
What do you think
will be the results?

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.050
Take a moment.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.200
You can even stop the
video if you'd like to.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.079
OK ready?

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.170
Here we go.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.060
Nothing very important
here, I'm afraid.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.880
But the point is to
experiment with your material.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.090
Remember you don't have
control of your light source

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.370
with a scanner as you
will with your camera.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.870
So at the very least,
take advantage of what

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.520
you do have control over.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.800
And in this case, it's the
placement of your device.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.780
Here you're seeing
this incredible animal

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.550
which is called a Euplectella,
which lives in the sea.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.260
This is his skeleton,
made out of silica.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.280
Now when you take
a careful look,

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.630
you can see that two
shrimp are living

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.930
within this guy in
what can be called

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.660
a symbiotic relationship.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.030
Which is very
interesting, tangential,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.680
but quite interesting.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.350
So I put this
three-dimensional skeleton

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.000
on the flatbed scanner,
covered it with black velvet,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.570
and took a very high res scan.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:33.000
I think it was
something like one Gig

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.500
file, which is pretty high.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.250
The black velvet becomes the
background of the image, right?

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.860
Now watch as we zoom
in to the image.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.829
We start seeing this magnificent
structure that nature

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.150
is somehow able to produce.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.920
Those fibers measure
about 50 microns.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.550
So I'm quite
serious about seeing

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.460
things of very fine
structure, if in fact,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.695
once again, you capture at
a high enough resolution.

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.080
Here's our final case study
for this particular tutorial.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.920
It's about a 2 1/2
centimeter device,

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.460
which once again I
place on the scanner.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.829
For this, I thought it
would be fun to show you

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.029
how I get some of these
things in the mail.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:22.400
I made a quick image
with my phone camera

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.720
to show you what I start with,
and eventually wind up with.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.150
I thought it would be
interesting for you.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.160
You can do this.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.900
You can see things that don't
look so great the beginning,

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:36.180
and imagine ways of creating
an image that is publishable.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.030
Take a hard look at your
device as I'm doing here.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.260
Try to look at it as if
you were looking at it

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.370
for the first time,
which I know is not easy,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.720
but that's the trick.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.930
You might even think about
focusing on getting a cover

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.670
image for your submission.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.000
That's where my thinking
was on this device,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.500
since the article was already
accepted for publication.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.420
So here, the image I
made was about 374 megs.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.020
And you can see as we
zoom in to the image

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.400
the nice detail in the device.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.630
Again, when you capture at
a high enough resolution

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.220
on your scanner, you
can see these details.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.580
So when you think
about cover designs,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.430
for example, think about
cropping and formatting

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.050
for the cover.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.840
In the end, it turned out
that for a cover submission

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.870
I did wind up using a camera
on the stereo microscope.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.200
This is what I made
with that equipment

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.220
I thought I was getting more
clarity with the microscope.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.280
But frankly when I compared
the two a few months later

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.170
as I record this tutorial, the
scan image looks pretty good.

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:45.480
And maybe I was in a
bit of overkill mode.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.180
These are the kinds
of decisions you'll

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.000
have to make for your own work.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.300
Maybe you have an opinion
about which is better.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.790
Take a look.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.450
By the way, in the end, in this
case, it didn't matter much.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.810
We didn't get the cover.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.470
But at least I was able to
show you another example.

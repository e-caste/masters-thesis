RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Today, we're

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.900
doing electric power
systems, sort of as they are,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.060
and as they have been.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.290
In 2010, electric power
systems were about 40%--

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.540
I'm going to have to stand
here and use the keyboard--

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.860
about 40% of primary energy, and
40% of CO2 emissions, roughly.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.650
Most electricity goes to
residential and commercial

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.890
sectors and supplies about
46% of the energy they use.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.990
What I want to do
today is to talk

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.120
about the essential
features of these systems.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.720
I'm guessing most of you haven't
had a course in power systems

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.690
since MIT doesn't teach a
course in power systems,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:11.810
really, and talk a little bit
about the regulatory regime.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.880
Monday we'll look
forward, what are

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.970
some of the challenges, what are
some of the opportunities, what

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.080
are some of the policy issues?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.290
So let's talk about
the power system.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800
The one thing you really
do have to keep in mind

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.290
is despite all of the
interest in storage,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.410
and everybody talks about
storage of electricity.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.240
As a practical
matter, you simply

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.760
can't store electricity in
bulk at a reasonable cost.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.450
You can pump water uphill and
use pumped hydro, and that's

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.440
pretty good, that's
pretty efficient,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.260
it's very hard to build
new pump hydro sites.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.640
There's one in New England.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.600
There are no plans
for any others.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.080
And as we'll see next
time, the value of storage

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.250
goes up over time.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.880
You can also pump
air underground.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.610
And there are like two
of those in the world.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.640
And there's a lot of
research into batteries,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.980
but so far nothing looks cheap.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.840
So at the moment, the
system operates effectively

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.540
without storage.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.850
And this matters
because demand varies

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.430
over time in ways that
are perfectly predictable.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.190
Here's some seasonal variation.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.640
This is a forecast
for New England.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.770
And you'll see that as it says,
their week 8 is late July.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.420
Week 8 was forecast
to be the peak.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.530
And week 32, which is that
sort of secondary peak

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.390
is early January.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.000
Most American systems
now look like that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.390
They peak in the summertime,
that's air conditioning.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.260
There's also a good
deal of variation.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.660
So you have to follow that load.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.320
You have to follow that
variation in demand.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.620
But hour-by-hour, there's
a lot of variation.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.720
Does the laser work?

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.260
No.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.410
OK, how long are my arms?

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.260
That sort of an
interesting-- that's what?

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.890
Last week for New England.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.620
And you'll see first of all
that the load in this relatively

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:24.140
uneventful April week varied
within a day between 9,000

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.200
and just about 16,000 megawatts.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.500
That's fairly substantial.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.490
You see April 2nd was a Monday.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.650
So you can see demand is
higher during the week

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.120
than the last two
which are the weekends.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.820
You'll also see the
distinctive feature.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.480
There's sort of a morning peak
and an evening peak most days.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.340
The evening peak, again focus
on the actual load, the blue.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.370
The evening peak is the higher.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.100
And the minimum occurs in
the middle of the night,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.660
not too surprisingly.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.450
But the system
has to track that.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.400
The system has to track that.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.690
The other thing you will see
in terms of predictability,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.190
forecast load, I'm not sure
how far ahead that forecast is.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.040
But DA is Day Ahead.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.010
So the New England system
operates with a market.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.570
And there's a real
time clearing,

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.153
which there has to
be because you have

00:04:22.153 --> 00:04:23.600
to follow it second-to-second.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.190
But there's also a
day ahead market.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.140
So the DA gives you in effect
the day ahead forecast.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.420
And you will see the
difference between the green

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.900
and the blue is usually
small but not trivial, not 0.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.070
What else to say?

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.310
Any comments or
questions so far on this.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.230
Yeah, Jacob.

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:55.547
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:55.547 --> 00:04:57.630
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
it's got to be made up.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.950
The question is,
that's a day ahead.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:03.840
Some of this is going to be--

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.250
the actual load tended
to be above the day

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.750
ahead which suggests--

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.980
well, if this were
the summertime,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.680
I'd say this suggests warmer
than expected, which is

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.840
sort of what it was that week.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.110
You get better at forecasting
the weather as you get closer.

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.330
So an hour or two ahead.

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.390
It's not like, oh, my God, right
now we've got to make a change.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.540
But you may have a few hours
warning that it's warmer

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.250
than we thought.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.010
So we really have
to ramp stuff up.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.250
But yeah, something has
to follow that load.

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.735
It could be hydro.

00:05:37.735 --> 00:05:40.120
It could be gas turbines.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.430
It's not going to
be big coal plants

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.370
because as I'll
come to in a minute,

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.732
following load with big coal
plants is very expensive.

00:05:47.732 --> 00:05:49.190
There's a lot of
stuff you get hot.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.800
There's a lot of stuff spinning.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.010
And to let that cool
off and/or slow down

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.440
and then bring it back
wastes a lot of energy.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.770
So you want things that
are quick that don't

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.460
have a lot of rotating mass.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.310
And that don't
have a lot of stuff

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.960
that you have to heat and cool,
I have to heat and then reheat.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:11.710
Anything else?

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.608
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:12.608 --> 00:06:18.993
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:18.993 --> 00:06:20.910
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Why
is there 10,000 what?

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:27.290
AUDIENCE: Megawatts [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.773
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, it could.

00:06:30.773 --> 00:06:31.940
What are these people doing?

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.600
I don't know.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.520
This is you guys
working late, I guess.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.310
You've got me.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:43.150
Some of that traditionally
would be industrial load,

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.670
like if you're running
a factory three shifts.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.500
There's not that much
of that in New England.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.310
Some of it may be HVAC in
some buildings consuming

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:03.040
electricity, fans running,
various kinds of machinery.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.260
There are also these
vampire load devices,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.510
when you have almost anything
plugged in, even if it's

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.190
turned off, it sucks power.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.770
So those loads have gone up.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.600
I have never really seen an
analysis of 3:00 AM load.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.910
But you're right.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.660
Your consumption probably
goes a lot lower.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.483
You're within day variation
is probably greater than that.

00:07:27.483 --> 00:07:29.650
And I'm trying to think
about the apartment building

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.380
where I live and what goes
on at 3:00 in the morning.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:37.450
And about all that's going
on is in a warm period

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:41.740
like this there may be some AC
usage, although ours wasn't on.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.950
So I don't know.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.440
And you know, you've
got appliances

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.570
running all night long,
refrigerators and such.

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.440
But I don't know.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.090
Anything else?

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:51.960
Yeah, Jacqueline.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.058
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:54.058 --> 00:07:56.100
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: The
forecast is presumably--

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.140
and I should have checked
before I put this up.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.350
The forecast is presumably
farther back in time than day

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:02.010
ahead.

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:03.820
The forecast is a forecast.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:05.970
This would be the
regional authority.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.740
And I'll talk about
them a bit later.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.500
The regional authorities
guess maybe a week ahead

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.670
or two weeks ahead.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.960
Day ahead clear demand,
that's a market.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.570
People bid to supply.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:18.320
There's demand.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:22.880
Well, it clears at a price.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.450
We'll come to price later.

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.110
But that is a market.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.220
That's a market outcome.

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.112
That's a forecast outcome.

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:34.820
And I just don't know
how far in advance.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.270
But it's clearly by the regional
authority that runs the system.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:41.450
An actual load is what
actually happened when you

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:44.840
turned on your computer, so OK.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:59.010
Short term variation, minute to
minute, the frequency, right?

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:04.080
Everything assumes, all
your equipment assumes,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.120
your appliances
assume that you'll

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.980
be getting electricity that
vary 60 cycles a second.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.530
That frequency has
to be maintained.

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:17.070
And it's mainly maintained
by sort of automatic control

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.430
at designated units.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.790
But when you get big
changes like that,

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.710
governors aren't going to do it.

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:26.160
And you will need to
bring units on and off.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.040
So let me talk about
technology mix.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:37.730
So we mentioned a little
earlier that you have fast

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.620
responding generating
units, turbines say,

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:47.210
or diesels to respond to
short term variations in load.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:51.110
But even if you could
forecast the load,

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:54.190
you would want units like that.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:10:02.940
And as I mentioned, it's
expensive to vary the output

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.340
from what are called base
load units, nuclear power

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:08.320
plants, big coal plants.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.620
But not only that, when
you run them flat out,

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:16.030
they have very low running
cost, nuclear virtually 0,

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:19.090
coal pretty low.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.670
You can buy turbines or diesels.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.400
But they're very expensive
to build these big units.

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.880
The little units, peaking
units or intermediate units,

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.680
but let me just
assume two kinds,

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:33.500
think coal plants
and gas turbines,

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.960
they're cheap to
build, but they're

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.340
expensive to run, relatively
on today's prices.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:45.560
So you would want
since load varies,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.330
you're not going to run your
whole fleet all the time,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:48.830
right?

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.900
If we didn't have
those variations,

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.230
if demand were constant,
you just build,

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.180
well, but for
environmental issues

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.070
you just build
cheap coal plants,

00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.970
cheap nuclear plants if you
could find one, combined cycle

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.380
plants and run
them all the time.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.170
But since the load
varies, you know

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.330
that you're not going to run
your plants all the time.

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.640
So what do you do?

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:17.120
If you look, Imagine two
plants of the same capacity.

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:21.830
One is, I call it a peaker,
but let it be a gas turbine.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.057
And the other is a baseload,
let it be a coal plant.

00:11:26.057 --> 00:11:27.890
They don't tend to have
the same capacities,

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.210
but for the sake of
argument, suppose they do.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.790
You ask, what's the
total cost of this plant?

00:11:38.341 --> 00:11:41.750
The more hours you
run it, the larger

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.410
will be the fuel cost as a
component of total cost, right?

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.020
So the total cost
consists of the cost

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.800
of building the thing,
basically taken down

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.920
to say a per day cost
or a per year cost.

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.590
And then the slope is the
marginal cost of running it.

00:11:58.590 --> 00:12:01.340
So the height gives
you the total cost.

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.520
If you're going to
run all year long,

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.680
then the base load plant
is the plant to build.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:14.440
Because way out here, the
fact that the fuel is cheap

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.260
makes up for the capital cost.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.240
But if you're only going
to run it a little bit

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.980
but you have to
have it, then you

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.910
want to build a peaker, right?

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:26.790
Is that notion clear?

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.680
The fact that there's
output variation

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:31.470
means you want to have
plants of multiple types.

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.840
If you can get a base
load plant to run

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:38.790
almost all the time,
or all the time, then

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:40.000
you're in great shape.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.730
But if you have to
have plants that

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:45.780
run only a little bit,
only a few hours per year,

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:48.090
then you've got to
have some of these.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.590
And you've always got that mix.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:53.610
We're going to talk about
wind and solar next time.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.830
They don't quite fit
either of these categories,

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:59.340
if you think about
it for a minute.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:03.676
But if that's clear,
then let's look at this.

00:13:07.148 --> 00:13:11.430
The red curve is what's
called a low duration curve.

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.760
And it's the actual curve,
because I happen to find it.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.400
It's the actual curve for--

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.750
it's probably England and Wales.

00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.980
It says Great Britain, for 2007.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.170
What a low duration
curve is, you

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:30.810
look at how much electricity
was consumed hour-by-hour.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.490
And you basically convert those
to a graph putting the hour

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.650
with the highest
consumption here, then

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:39.060
the second highest there.

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.700
You basically stack it up.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:47.340
So out here at 100%, you have
the consumption, the demand,

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:49.260
and it's expressed as
a percentage of peak

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:56.310
to keep life simple, the
percentage of peak demand

00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:00.840
at the lowest hour of the
year, presumably at 3 o'clock

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.670
in the morning on
some day that was

00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.770
neither hot nor cold
so nobody needed

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.290
to run anything, any HVAC.

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.710
And it was a holiday, so there
was no industrial work going

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:12.910
on, or whatever.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:17.790
So if you go back to this
picture, this picture says,

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:22.582
if you're going to run a plant
fewer than H star hours a year,

00:14:22.582 --> 00:14:23.790
you're going to want to peak.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.560
It's going to have to be a peak.

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.065
It should be a peaker
rather than a baseload.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:35.070
Come to this picture, and
you say, OK, let's suppose--

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:37.170
just because it
fits the picture--

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:41.110
that if there are
8,760 hours in a year,

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:42.810
this is like 42
gallons in a barrel,

00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:44.910
another one of those
numbers you have to have.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:54.970
8,760 hours in a year,
let's see if I can do this.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:15:00.250
If you build baseload
capacity up to this line,

00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:04.810
you know that it will be
running at least that fraction

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:05.770
of hours.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.930
You'll have to cut
it down somewhat

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.680
in the really low hours.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.670
But if you build that
much baseload capacity,

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:19.300
it will run for at
least this many hours.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:23.710
Because demand exceeds that
capacity for that fraction

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.740
of the year, right?

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:32.110
So we're asking,
you decide what you

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.780
want to build in terms
of baseload capacity

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.580
as a fraction of the peak.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.790
Read across to the
curve and come down

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:43.240
and you get the fraction of
hours of the year when demand

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.950
is at least that high, right?

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:51.270
So we've normalized
the low duration curve

00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:52.840
so the peak is 100.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.870
We also normalized time,
which is kind of awkward

00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:00.590
so that 8,760 hours equals 100.

00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:04.100
So we can do percentages.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.300
So again, this is just stylized.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.620
But if H star over
8,760 is here,

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.440
then that says you build half
baseload capacity and half

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.650
peaker capacity, right?

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:22.000
The peakers are only
going to come into play

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.890
when demand is above--

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.410
and this is where
I need the laser--

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:29.050
is above that 50% point.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.560
That's an artifact.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.880
This is stylized 50%.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.300
It has no particular
significance in life.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.530
It just works out
in this picture.

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:43.190
So you'd build 1/2 peaker
capacity and 1/2 base load.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:50.920
The peak units would be on for
less than H star hours a year,

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.392
or less than this fraction
of hours per year.

00:16:55.392 --> 00:16:56.350
So it makes some sense.

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.790
You see why you need the mix.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.760
And this is just
mechanical to say,

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:09.140
if I know where the breakpoint
is, then I've got to say,

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.385
what fraction of the year.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.770
I've got to use the
low duration curve

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:22.160
to go from the break
point where I decide

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.290
between the different
technologies, the base

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:27.560
load and the peaker
in this case,

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:31.800
and to get a capacity mix out
of that, for what fraction

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.770
of the year, blah, blah, blah.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:40.380
OK, I know I want to build
baseload plants that will

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:42.925
run at least this fraction.

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:49.110
We'll run at least this
fraction of the year.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.590
I want peakers
that will run less.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:57.390
The load duration curve
translates that into capacity,

00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:58.770
OK.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:02.670
Detail is not critical,
concept pretty critical.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:03.300
Questions?

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:08.362
Yeah.

00:18:08.362 --> 00:18:11.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.930
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I'd
have to use them both, right?

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:16.093
I'd have to go back
and say, OK, what

00:18:16.093 --> 00:18:18.010
are the characteristics
of these technologies?

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.600
Where's the breakpoint?

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.510
Where is the breakpoint?

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.740
And then what I
would do in fact,

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.550
if I'm doing this, if
I'm centrally planning

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:32.380
and I'm not a market, if I'm
centrally planning I would A,

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:35.030
allow for reserve margin.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:38.050
So I wouldn't build
just capacity.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:41.200
And I would allow for the fact
that I don't know the load

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.660
duration curve exactly.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.900
So I'd do a little
stochastic work here.

00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:50.960
I'd say, if the curve
varies up and down by 20%,

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.720
what do I need to be sure?

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.110
And I'd work out a somewhat
more complicated problem.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:01.450
What I gave you was, well, if
I've only got two technologies

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:06.130
and the slate is
clean, then I know

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:11.320
how to choose based on how
long the plant is going to run.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:16.540
And using this curve, I can
go from how long the plant is

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:20.550
going to run to how
much of it I need,

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:23.370
based on how many
hours demand will

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.940
be above and below
certain levels, right?

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.700
So yeah, that's exactly what
this exercise in the very

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:30.780
simple case would do.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:33.160
It would optimize the fleet.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.820
And you need both.

00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.590
Even if you don't have to worry
about quick response, which

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:45.310
is not present in this
picture, you'd need both, OK.

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.790
In fact, in real systems you
have multiple technologies.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.770
And this is a very strange
graph, but it makes that point.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:07.030
This shows in 2008
supposedly ranked vertically

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.630
by marginal cost
and horizontally

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:17.320
by capacity, all the plants
in the lower 48 states.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:22.420
And so it gives you
sort of a supply curve.

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.950
The lower 48 states are
not a single market.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.190
So it's a funny kind
of supply curve.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:29.050
But it gives you the sense.

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:38.020
It shows hydro there in the
far left, which essentially, it

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.775
has only an opportunity
cost of running, right?

00:20:40.775 --> 00:20:43.150
If you let the water out now,
you don't have it tomorrow.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.108
So there's a little bit
of an opportunity cost.

00:20:45.108 --> 00:20:46.930
But out of pocket is 0.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:50.860
And then you've got nukes, which
have a very low running cost.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:55.670
And then you've got this mixture
of coal and gas and others.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:21:00.520
And then finally, up here
that vertical portion,

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.640
that's the oh, my God,
start the diesels portion.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.850
That's the very hot summer day
when very inefficient, very

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.450
dirty diesels that
are kept around

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:12.740
to run for only a few
hours a year get fired up.

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.650
So there are really
expensive units

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:17.640
that you keep on hand,
even though they're

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:20.280
expensive to run
because you've got them.

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:23.110
And on a hot summer
day, you may need them.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.800
So in fact, that two
technology picture

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.540
that I gave you is too simple
because you'd want to build

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.730
a more complicated mixture.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:37.430
But you need a mixture, OK.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:40.170
Comments, yeah, Scott.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.170
AUDIENCE: So by
capacity, does it mean

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.160
what capacity you turn it on?

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.310
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No,
it means, this tells you

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.720
the total hydro capacity.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.820
This is the total nuclear
capacity, this distance.

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:54.810
So it's giving you a sense
of how much you can get

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:56.820
at different marginal costs.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.030
So it is a supply
curve in that sense

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.230
if they were all in the same
market dot, dot, dot, dot,

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:07.090
yeah, OK.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.760
OK, what's the grid look like?

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.870
You can have multiple
generating plants

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.180
in any particular region.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:25.330
But you really
can't economically

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.910
have multiple
transmission systems

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.400
and multiple
distribution systems.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.950
They are typically considered
natural monopolies.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.460
What a natural monopoly
means is generally

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:45.920
defined as having more than
one of them would raise costs.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:51.820
So if you think of the X's
in that subadditivity bullet

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.890
as basically electricity
supplied to houses,

00:22:56.890 --> 00:23:01.990
so each component is
a house or a building,

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:04.690
rather than total kilowatt
hours, but a vector

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:08.830
of locations, then
subadditivity by that definition

00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:12.700
means it's cheaper to supply.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:18.400
You can't split the system
without raising costs.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.440
The normal picture
you get for this

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:30.480
is, if the X's are scalars, then
it's just economies of scale.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:36.420
So natural monopoly is
present in electricity.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:42.100
It's present in
other areas as well.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:45.303
Let's do a minute on why
there's a problem when

00:23:45.303 --> 00:23:46.470
you have a natural monopoly.

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.870
What's the policy problem?

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:56.740
Why do we bother
to talk about it?

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.150
Alex, are you raising your hand?

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:00.010
Or no, you were not
raising your hand.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:01.840
You were thinking about
raising your hand?

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:02.710
No, not even that.

00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:10.260
OK, OK, we're back
in 1401 or 001.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.710
Kierstan and then David.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.967
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
otherwise a natural monopoly

00:24:15.967 --> 00:24:20.500
would release them to just
take as much as they could.

00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So what enables

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.740
it to take as much as it could?

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:25.000
AUDIENCE: No competition.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.375
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you think

00:24:26.375 --> 00:24:37.260
there would be no competition
and they'd make a lot of money.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:41.820
But we like making a
lot of money, don't we?

00:24:41.820 --> 00:24:42.570
Consumers don't.

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.090
So there'd be a welfare loss.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.820
David?

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.220
AUDIENCE: I mean, yeah, they
could just charge as much

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:01.400
up to the point where it would
be profitable for another firm

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.690
to enter.

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.982
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I mean,
it's actually interesting.

00:25:04.982 --> 00:25:07.670
We always assume in
these discussions

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:08.960
that competition isn't viable.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.050
And cable television
is a standard example

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:16.702
of a natural monopoly, local
cable television distribution.

00:25:16.702 --> 00:25:18.535
But there are a number
of places where there

00:25:18.535 --> 00:25:21.250
are competing cable systems.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:25.180
And that's wasteful, but it may
be less wasteful than having

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.880
really high prices--

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:31.311
welfare loss because
of high prices.

00:25:31.311 --> 00:25:32.907
AUDIENCE: They can
also under supply.

00:25:32.907 --> 00:25:35.240
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
that's the same story, right?

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.290
You raise the price.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.560
You supply less.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.400
I can't draw it.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:45.170
You might like to end
up at some point like A,

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:50.180
and in fact, what a monopoly
in this situation might do

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.420
is produce 1/2 that where
the production would B,

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.800
but the price would be
notably higher than at A.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:58.550
AUDIENCE: That's good
for the environment.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:25:58.880
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: What?

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.530
AUDIENCE: It's good for the
environment [INAUDIBLE],,

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:03.447
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Good for the environment.

00:26:03.447 --> 00:26:04.620
Good for the environment.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.930
So we should just
deregulate electricity

00:26:06.930 --> 00:26:11.550
throughout because we'd
spent a lot of money.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:12.892
Interesting point.

00:26:12.892 --> 00:26:14.850
Anybody else, anything
else that could go wrong

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:15.680
in this situation?

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.590
OK, what about cost?

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:26.100
Let's think about human beings
running an organization.

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.130
And you have no competition.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.470
And you're providing
a necessity.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:36.520
And your brother-in-law
asks for a job.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.340
You hire your
brother-in-law, right?

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.645
There's a cost problem.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:50.970
We always draw these curves
like these come out of the sky.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:52.770
And we march down cost curves.

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:56.730
In fact, these are determined
by organizational decisions.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.230
And when you have a monopoly,
the pressure to actually do

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:05.850
unpleasant things like
firing people or not

00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:11.130
hiring your brother-in-law,
those pressures are gone.

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.650
Not gone, they're diminished.

00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:14.610
They're diminished.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:15.705
So you expect high costs.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.540
There's another
reason, and it's not

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.100
true for all natural monopolies.

00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:29.050
But it's true for the ones that
we're mostly concerned about,

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.760
most of these things are
called public utilities.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.110
Now, it's not true for
cable television yet.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:38.200
Electricity used to
be a luxury good.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.820
Telephones used to
be a luxury good.

00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:41.650
They're not anymore.

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.410
They're mostly
considered necessities.

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:47.680
And when you raise the price,
as Kierstan wanted them to do,

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:50.740
to raise the price to
pay for necessities,

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.620
you're basically taking money
out of poor people's pockets

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.600
and giving them to
rich shareholders.

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:02.290
So these are the problems that
people mostly worry about.

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.840
And that business about
triangles and rectangles,

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:05.890
let me just remind you.

00:28:13.230 --> 00:28:15.450
For some reason let
this be marginal cost

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.400
equals average cost.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.450
And this is the demand curve.

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:26.273
And this is, of course,
what you'd like, right?

00:28:26.273 --> 00:28:27.690
You'd like production
at the point

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:30.700
where price equals
marginal cost.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:35.240
And this is the price axis,
and this is the quantity axis.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.760
The classic thing that
a monopoly might do

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:43.010
is to produce say,
QM, and charge PM.

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:50.040
And then the deadweight loss,
this triangle over here.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.440
I'm hoping, I'm
reminding you, it's

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.980
the difference between what
people were willing to pay

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:59.130
and what it would have cost
to produce this output that's

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:01.080
not produced.

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.250
So that's a loss, right?

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:07.980
If you reduce output
from say Q star to QM,

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:11.050
you lose that triangle.

00:29:11.050 --> 00:29:13.180
But suppose what
in fact, happens

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:22.090
is the monopolist is really
lazy and costs go up to PM.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:26.830
Well, in that case, you
lose the rectangle too.

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:29.440
And in most reasonable
cases, the rectangles

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.090
are bigger than the triangles.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:34.600
So that if I can't resist
hiring my brother-in-law,

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.740
neither can anybody else.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:41.320
That could be much worse aside
from the rich/poor issue,

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.950
than the fact that
I'm pricing high, OK.

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:46.450
So these are things
you worry about.

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.840
What do you do about it?

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.370
Water supply is like this.

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:57.410
You could argue bus
service is like this.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.360
Telephone distribution
is like this.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.820
Electricity distribution
is like this.

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.738
Electricity transmission
is like this.

00:30:03.738 --> 00:30:05.030
Now, we're mostly about energy.

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:07.230
But it is a general problem.

00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:09.890
What are some of the
solutions, right.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:15.490
This difficulty,
a natural monopoly

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.510
arises across time and
space and industries.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:24.670
And a variety of mechanisms
have been adopted.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:25.720
What might you do?

00:30:34.890 --> 00:30:43.910
So we could have a private firm,
and we could regulate it, OK?

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:46.090
Anything else, Brendan?

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:51.598
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:51.598 --> 00:30:53.390
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, that's not good.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:54.307
What am I going to do?

00:30:54.307 --> 00:30:57.170
If I can't have competition
as an economic matter.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.520
I can split it.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.010
You're saying
forced competition.

00:31:01.010 --> 00:31:04.220
Well, what if I split it
and in fact, one of them

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.010
goes out of business?

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:12.290
See, the problem with this, if
you go back to this picture,

00:31:12.290 --> 00:31:13.730
if I've got two
firms and they're

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.550
both on this cost
curve, the larger one

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:19.290
always has a cost advantage.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:23.600
So you can imagine
competition working.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.330
But you could also imagine the
larger firm drives the smaller

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:28.770
firm out just competing.

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:31.410
And nobody comes in because
they have a big cost

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.120
disadvantage if they come in.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.860
So that's a tough one.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.120
Most industries, that's
what you want to do.

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.490
And that's what's done.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.520
But that's tough here.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.720
Anything else?

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.970
Yeah, Max.

00:31:43.970 --> 00:31:46.130
AUDIENCE: A government
run enterprise.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:53.930
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You
could have a government run

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:54.620
enterprise.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.520
Let me drill down a
little bit on regulation.

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.260
How might you regulate?

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:06.760
Max.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.153
AUDIENCE: Price floor.

00:32:08.153 --> 00:32:10.320
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
no, you actually probably

00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:12.557
don't want to price floor.

00:32:12.557 --> 00:32:13.390
Price ceiling maybe.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.420
Oh, you want them to raise
prices to bring in entry?

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:26.620
Yeah, ooh, ooh, that could
be really expensive, right?

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:31.390
Remember, if you split,
you've raised costs.

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:33.070
And now you're going
to raise the price

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:36.460
to make sure that you can
survive with higher costs.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:40.340
You get more companies in.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:46.300
There actually have been
examples of competing

00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:48.700
telephone systems historically.

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:52.220
I don't know of any
competing, I don't

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:55.970
know offhand of any competing
electric distribution systems.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.780
There are competing
cable systems.

00:32:57.780 --> 00:32:59.120
It's expensive, right?

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:00.500
I mean, you're duplicating.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.880
You're duplicating.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.370
So most people say, that's
triangles versus rectangles.

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:07.400
You're saying,
I'll tolerate, I'll

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:11.720
tolerate a higher cost
as long as they're not

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.620
making any money.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.190
Well, I don't want to pay a
higher price, Max, I'm sorry.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.740
I'm happy that they're
not making profits.

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.993
But what you're managing
to do is to raise the cost.

00:33:22.993 --> 00:33:24.660
And that's the natural
monopoly problem.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.280
That's the core of it.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:30.190
If you get competition, then you
will have it at a higher cost.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:35.130
And sometimes, if
you think about ways

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:40.470
that curve could look, sometimes
in fact, if that curve is

00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:44.790
shallow enough, you'd be right.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:48.120
Let's have a little competition,
the costs will go up,

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.880
but the incentives
will be stronger.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.740
They will not hire
their brothers-in-law.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.360
And yeah, the costs will be up.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.240
But the pressure on
prices will overwhelm it.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.940
Mostly that's not true.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.400
I mean, telephone it might be.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.660
Wireless, it surely is.

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.989
That's why we can have
competing wireless companies.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.590
We have maybe three in Europe.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.960
They tend to have more.

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:13.860
That's easy.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.500
But wireline, that's tough.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.500
Yeah, David.

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.310
AUDIENCE: So the
shareholders are

00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:24.788
the people who are using
the services, do You know?

00:34:24.788 --> 00:34:27.330
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, that
would be a cooperative model.

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:34.199
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.900
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That's
exactly the cooperative model.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.330
And you do see it.

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:42.060
You do see it.

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:44.530
Let me just mention, there are
a number of different ways.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.199
Those are the three
main alternatives.

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:47.699
There are a number
of different ways

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.980
to skin this one, to regulate.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:53.565
And I'll just say a little bit,
not go into too much detail.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:00.040
Regulation, so I've got
government ownership

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.890
at the top and
cooperatives at the bottom.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.847
I didn't talk about
franchise bidding.

00:35:05.847 --> 00:35:07.930
I think that will take us
a little too far afield.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:13.780
But that's the bid for the
right to provide electricity.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:18.700
Different kinds of
regulation, you could do--

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.480
the early streetcars and buses
and electric power systems

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.880
and cable systems were
regulated by cities.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.010
And the city had
jurisdiction because they

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.490
needed to use the streets.

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:35.080
So yes, you can put
up your phone lines,

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:36.790
yes, you can run the streetcars.

00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:41.770
But you need to comply
with certain restrictions.

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:44.080
I will talk about rate
of return regulation.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.650
That's been the
dominant way electricity

00:35:47.650 --> 00:35:50.560
has been regulated since
the early 20th century.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.010
It's focused on profits.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:57.910
And incentive
regulation is to try

00:35:57.910 --> 00:36:00.790
to hold prices
constant for a while

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.120
to give incentives to cut cost.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.770
I will cycle back to this.

00:36:05.770 --> 00:36:06.680
I will cycle back.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.197
But just to know that there
are a whole set of approaches

00:36:09.197 --> 00:36:10.030
that have been used.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:14.270
They all become political.

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:17.290
They involve decisions
made by people.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.090
They involve decisions
made by people

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:23.660
who are subject to voters,
typically, one way or another,

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.770
either government enterprise
or they are regulated

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:32.050
or the co-op members vote.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:34.510
So one of the things you
want to do is as little

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:36.410
of this as possible.

00:36:36.410 --> 00:36:39.430
So transmission
and distribution,

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:44.980
natural monopolies
pose a policy problem.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:50.610
In terms of the
architecture, I don't know

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:55.530
why this is a blackboard talk.

00:36:55.530 --> 00:36:59.280
But when I say that low voltage
distribution systems are

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.510
a tree, there will
be a substation

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:14.880
and feeders go out to serve
neighborhoods and houses

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.190
and so forth.

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:19.470
The transmission
system, if you look,

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.150
I'll show you a map
in a little bit.

00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:23.130
But you might have
a generator here.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:26.430
You might have city or
load here and load there

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.590
and another generator here.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:30.660
The transmission
system will be a mesh.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:38.828
It's a different architecture.

00:37:38.828 --> 00:37:40.245
It means there are
multiple paths.

00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:46.290
In the tree structure,
you'd have a substation.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:48.670
And this would be a house.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:50.940
There's only one path.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.570
There are multiple paths,
well, in this case three

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.520
from this generator
to this load.

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:03.660
The reason for multiple paths
of course, is reliability.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:05.580
The reason for a tree
structure is cost.

00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:12.060
In some dense urban areas,
the distribution system

00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.490
is a mesh because
the lines are short.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.090
And you might as well.

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.290
But if you think of any rural
or suburban area, it's a tree.

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.310
The transmission system, I
have to say for most of us

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:27.930
it takes a little
getting used to.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:31.910
You don't switch current, right?

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:36.440
If you do the analysis,
power from this generator

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:42.080
to this load goes
on all three paths,

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:45.270
depending on the
characteristics of the path.

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.790
You can change those
characteristics

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:48.620
with expensive technology.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:51.470
But mostly it's passive.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:57.200
That means-- well,
it means two things.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:08.630
That means if I demand more
here, Demand goes up here,

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:12.710
and I increase generation
here, I could in fact

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:15.680
cause a problem on this
line because some power

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.490
will flow through it.

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:20.330
And if that line can't
handle it, I could run into,

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:21.410
it could overheat.

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:22.760
It could sag.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.890
This is called loop flow.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:31.820
When electricity over multiple
paths causes problems,

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:36.530
particularly let's say,
that's a national border.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.360
So I can cause
congestion over here.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.970
I can cause a problem
over here when I increase

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.940
demand and generation here.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.685
Now, you might say,
well, can't we fix that?

00:39:46.685 --> 00:39:47.810
The answer is a little bit.

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:51.740
We can fix that now
with power electronics.

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:55.010
We can change some of the
characteristics of these lines.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:57.890
But it's expensive,
and it's not much done.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:01.760
OK, so it's a strange system.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:06.080
It's not intuitive,
not intuitive.

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:10.400
Question about the architecture
or about the problem?

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.080
OK, here's the picture.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.360
Yeah, there are
about 170,000 miles

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.490
in the US of high voltage.

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:24.500
I think it's 200k,
200,000 volts,

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:30.110
230,000 volts is the
threshold for transmission.

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.290
You will note that
the country is

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:36.550
divided into three things
that are labeled interconnect.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:45.050
Technical description,
the interconnects

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:49.790
are connected with
relatively low capacity,

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:53.620
direct current lines
in a couple of places.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:58.780
Each interconnect is
basically one big machine.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.850
Everything is turning
together, everything

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:04.090
is synchronized, all the
generators, all the frequency--

00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:07.970
little variations, but not much.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:12.700
It's easy to see why there's an
Eastern and a Western, right?

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.710
Because you've got
the Rocky Mountains,

00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:18.170
relatively low
population density.

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:20.710
It didn't make a
lot of sense to try

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:22.990
to connect New York
and Los Angeles

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:25.420
in the same synchronized system.

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.240
It certainly didn't
50 years ago.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.190
Probably doesn't now.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.320
Why is Texas independent?

00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.870
Why is Texas a
separate interconnect?

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:37.030
Why isn't Texas synchronized?

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:44.890
Oh, take a jump.

00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:46.446
Take a shot.

00:41:46.446 --> 00:41:49.800
AUDIENCE: Didn't want to.

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.760
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
There was a political deal

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.780
made in the '30s.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.220
It was a political deal
made in the '30s that

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:04.970
has the fiction but near truth
that electrons don't cross

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:07.800
the boundaries of this area.

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.410
Therefore what goes
on in here is not

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:12.780
subject to federal regulation
because it's wholly

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.330
within one state.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:17.150
Does that make electrical sense?

00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:21.650
No, Should it be obvious that
Texas and Louisiana should

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:23.330
be separate electrically?

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:27.890
No, but in the '30s, it was
part of getting a deal done.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:32.990
Whenever you see
something like this,

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.090
do not assume it's
a technical reason.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:38.350
Because it usually isn't.

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.060
I'll give you one
other example and then

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.380
I'll take your question.

00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:48.610
Within the country there are
about 107 so-called balancing

00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:49.600
areas.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:52.060
Each balancing area
is a control center

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:55.210
that's responsible
for electrical flows

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:57.160
across its boundary, right?

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:00.580
It will have certain obligations
like not sending a lot out

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.290
or not bringing a lot in.

00:43:02.290 --> 00:43:05.320
So there's one control,
there's one balancing area

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.790
in New England.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:09.490
There's one balancing
area in New York.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:13.070
There are eight balancing
areas in Arkansas.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:16.380
That is not the answer to
any technical question,

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.114
OK, Brendan.

00:43:18.114 --> 00:43:21.220
AUDIENCE: Because of this
system, do people in Texas

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.610
pay a higher, lower
cost for electricity?

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:28.397
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Oh, I would say

00:43:28.397 --> 00:43:30.230
trying to figure out
whether this system has

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:34.970
had any effect on Texas
costs is probably impossible.

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:37.880
Texas rates are reasonably low.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:39.170
Texas burns a lot of coal.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:47.350
Texas is big enough that the
reliability implications aren't

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.760
that great, right?

00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.040
If you decided to make
Belmont, Massachusetts

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.220
separate from the rest of the
country with say one generating

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:56.800
plant if Belmont
has one, you would

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:00.160
expect reliability problems
just because if that plant goes

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.930
down, which it has
to occasionally,

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:03.280
the system goes down.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:06.910
Texas is big enough that
hasn't been an issue.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:10.540
Texas has a lot of renewables,
which is kind of a surprise.

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:13.150
But Texas has a
lot of wind power.

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.730
That's an issue, it is
also is a cost issue.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:18.070
But I don't think
this has much to do

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:20.950
with the price of
electricity in Texas.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:23.860
It's just a really
interesting oddity, and is

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:27.430
I hope always a cautionary flag.

00:44:27.430 --> 00:44:30.850
When you see something
that looks like it's weird,

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:34.600
it's either a political deal or
a consequence of the tax system

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.830
is my rule of thumb.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:36.700
And this is a deal.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:37.200
Yeah.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:38.950
AUDIENCE: So why
isn't all of Texas?

00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:40.950
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:41.938
And I don't know.

00:44:41.938 --> 00:44:42.480
I don't know.

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:46.380
You wonder why I say, I think
that's Amarillo up there,

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:47.130
that top dot.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:48.930
And I do not know
why whoever made

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:52.140
the deal wrote off North Texas.

00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:55.243
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:55.243 --> 00:44:57.160
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Same boundary, boundaries

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.000
haven't changed.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.050
No, no, you don't want to
say that too close to Texas.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.810
I mean, Texas is--

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:07.640
when I asked this question the
first year I taught the course,

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.700
the answer from a Texan
was, so we can secede.

00:45:12.968 --> 00:45:15.260
I don't know why they wouldn't
take Amarillo with them.

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:17.440
And whoever that
second dot is, I

00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.410
don't know who that is either.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:22.150
I don't have an answer.

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:26.950
My guess is that actually
was an electrical response.

00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:30.760
That part of Texas may have had
closer electrical connections

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.622
outside the state than inside.

00:45:33.622 --> 00:45:35.080
And somebody said,
look, that would

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:38.380
be really stupid to kind of
reconfigure the transmission

00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.850
system.

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:40.570
I'm guessing.

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:42.250
I don't know.

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:44.730
Anything else?

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:52.870
OK, all right, let me spend
most of the rest of the time

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.270
on sort of how we
got here and walk

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:56.650
through the regulatory history.

00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.820
First, central generating
station, Thomas Edison,

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:09.530
New York, 59
customers, lighting.

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:14.120
And by the way, you think you
have a load variation problem

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:16.230
now with those New
England things,

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:19.980
think about when your
only product is lighting.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:23.480
You shut the whole system
down in the daytime.

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.952
This is not a good way
to use your assets.

00:46:25.952 --> 00:46:27.410
So one of the first
things they did

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:31.010
was push for
electric streetcars.

00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:33.470
These early systems,
direct current systems

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:37.190
were regulated mostly by cities.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:38.188
They were local.

00:46:38.188 --> 00:46:39.230
They were direct current.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:41.090
Direct current at
low voltage doesn't

00:46:41.090 --> 00:46:43.792
travel very far efficiently.

00:46:43.792 --> 00:46:46.250
And you don't want to put high
voltage into people's homes.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:52.550
So we had a bunch
city-regulated systems

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.650
and then we had a bunch
of city-run systems.

00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:58.380
So in 1900, as
far as I can tell,

00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:02.840
the peak of municipal
systems, Belmont has one,

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:11.310
Los Angeles has one, they peaked
at 8% of generation in 1900.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:15.180
As alternating current
came in, and the big thing

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:18.480
with alternating current is
you can change it's voltage

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.640
relatively easily.

00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.530
So you can have high voltage
to send it long distances.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:25.420
And then you can take it
down for use in homes.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:32.700
So the transformer really makes
alternating current the winner.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.460
Now, You can take
DC up and down.

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.140
But it's more expensive.

00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:39.670
And you couldn't do
it for a long time.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:41.490
So alternating current wins.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:46.740
And as you begin to make
it technically possible

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:48.780
to go beyond a city--

00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.438
if you're doing
direct current, you're

00:47:50.438 --> 00:47:52.980
building a generating station,
you're serving a neighborhood.

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.990
We talked about
the London system

00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.030
and how it stayed that
way for a long time.

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:58.410
That's how they grow up.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:00.610
You build a generator
to serve a neighborhood.

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:02.880
And then maybe you go
to alternating current.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.170
But technically, once you
can do higher voltages,

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:09.120
you can expand.

00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:11.760
You can link up separate cities.

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.730
And that began to
happen after the turn

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:20.460
of the century and states took
over-regulation from cities.

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:24.620
The idea was we'd set up
these impartial commissions.

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:27.980
And these impartial
non-political public utility

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:34.220
commissions, not elected in most
states, not subject to removal

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:35.970
by the government,
independent commissions

00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:39.970
was an invention that
started, I'm now forgetting,

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:41.910
I think Wisconsin in 1907.

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:45.400
And by 1920, everybody,
almost everybody had them.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:46.650
Is anybody here from Nebraska?

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.640
OK, Nebraska doesn't have
a public utility commission

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.430
because no private
firm is selling

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:56.990
electricity in Nebraska.

00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:59.000
It's all government and co-ops.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.130
But everybody else has one.

00:49:02.130 --> 00:49:05.040
The Europeans didn't do this.

00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.490
What happened, the European
system started out like this.

00:49:08.490 --> 00:49:13.590
It started out
local, began to grow

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:17.080
and became government
enterprises.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:17.580
Why?

00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:28.130
OK, you figure that's the answer
to an engineering question.

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:33.910
That is not the answer to
an engineering question.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:37.470
The same electrons,
same technology,

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:39.480
similar densities in many areas.

00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.678
Jacob, save me here.

00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:43.470
AUDIENCE: Although they
may have provinces,

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:46.110
they're not as independent
government institutions

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:47.830
as they are in
the United States.

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:51.460
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
that's true to some extent.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.350
Although, take Germany.

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:58.668
Germany is and has been to
the extent that it was--

00:49:58.668 --> 00:50:00.460
well, it wasn't democratic
for a long time.

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:03.868
But it began as a set
of independent countries

00:50:03.868 --> 00:50:05.035
that became the [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:05.035 --> 00:50:07.760
It became a federal system.

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:14.050
So when the government took
over the Berlin system,

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:15.610
it was the Berlin government.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:18.410
It wasn't the
national government.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:21.233
So not all of these government
enterprises were national.

00:50:21.233 --> 00:50:22.150
But it's a good point.

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:23.567
The political
structures differed.

00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:26.440
And the US was if
not unique, then

00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:29.920
it stood out as having
this whole state structure.

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:35.810
It's just an
ideological difference.

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.160
An ideological difference.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.490
The US had a strong preference
for private enterprise.

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.690
Europe had a less
strong preference.

00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:51.110
It was a big debate in
the US through the '30s.

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:54.356
Should this stuff be government
or should it be private?

00:50:54.356 --> 00:50:56.550
Private mostly won in the US.

00:50:56.550 --> 00:50:59.880
Government mostly won in Europe.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.640
You can make
arguments both ways.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.570
I talked about various
solutions to natural monopolies.

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.940
The government
solution is, look,

00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:11.730
there are no shareholders
trying to rape and pillage here.

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:14.580
We're just all trying
to serve the customers.

00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:17.010
The private response
is, yes, and you're all

00:51:17.010 --> 00:51:18.630
hiring your brother-in-laws.

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:20.460
The costs are high.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.530
You have no stockholder
pressure to be efficient.

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:23.940
Costs will be too high.

00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.700
That debate ran
for 30, 40 years.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:29.320
It still goes on
in some quarters.

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.420
One side won in Europe.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.530
One side won in the US.

00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:40.730
OK, so far the
states, now the feds.

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:45.650
The federal government got
into electricity first in 1906

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:50.030
selling cheap surplus power
from irrigation projects.

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.760
It gave preference to
municipalities rather than

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.540
private buyers.

00:51:54.540 --> 00:51:56.418
Why was it cheap, do you think?

00:51:56.418 --> 00:51:58.460
Why was the power cheap
from irrigation projects?

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:05.380
OK, today is quirky
political explanations day.

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.710
In calculating the cost
of building something,

00:52:08.710 --> 00:52:11.950
the government tends to
use its borrowing rate.

00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:13.630
The cost of capital
to the government,

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:17.290
which has the power to tax is
lower than the cost of capital

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:19.790
to private firms that don't.

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:22.310
So all else equal,
the government

00:52:22.310 --> 00:52:23.960
can produce power cheaper.

00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.910
And if the main cost
is capital, which

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:30.030
it is for a hydro facility,
it could be a lot cheaper.

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:32.360
So the government says,
we're not making any money,

00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:34.010
we will sell it cheaply.

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:36.020
But then you've got to
figure out who gets it.

00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:38.090
And the decision was
municipal utilities.

00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.540
During the run up to the '20s--

00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:46.170
and that's an
amazing period if you

00:52:46.170 --> 00:52:47.420
think about growth industries.

00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:48.860
I just ran the numbers.

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.830
The growth in electric
power between 1900 and 1929

00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:54.290
averaged 14% a year.

00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:55.430
That's a boom.

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:57.350
That's a long boom.

00:52:57.350 --> 00:52:59.420
That was fun.

00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:02.390
It was fun except that these
guys were being regulated.

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:06.890
So their response was, we're
being regulated by states.

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:10.920
Let's have holding companies
that operate in multiple states

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:15.650
so we can kind of hide
the ball from regulators.

00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:19.520
And it was used to
fuel stock speculation.

00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:20.720
So they had a lot of fun.

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:24.580
They built these big
holding companies.

00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:25.600
I'll come back to that.

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:28.510
The federal power
commission, now the FERC,

00:53:28.510 --> 00:53:31.900
was formed in 1920 because
all navigable waterways

00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:32.980
are federal.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:37.160
It began to do some
regulation from 1935.

00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:40.610
In 1935 in response to
these holding companies,

00:53:40.610 --> 00:53:43.910
which really were
weird creatures.

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:47.270
And they were blamed for the
stock market crash of 1929.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:49.295
You always need to
find a scapegoat.

00:53:49.295 --> 00:53:51.170
So the scapegoat was
these utility companies.

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:51.878
They were broken.

00:53:51.878 --> 00:53:52.790
They were broken up.

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:56.083
You had to operate in
one contiguous area.

00:53:56.083 --> 00:53:58.250
You couldn't have a company
here and a company there

00:53:58.250 --> 00:53:59.760
under the same umbrella.

00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:04.400
Well, that really enforced what
was the vertically integrated

00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.327
monopoly structure.

00:54:05.327 --> 00:54:07.910
The same company would generate
the power, transmit the power,

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:08.930
and sell you the power.

00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:19.140
In the '30s, one of
Roosevelt's initiatives

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:23.250
was to get power to rural
areas, one of his priorities.

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:26.280
The existing utilities
weren't interested in doing it

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.210
because it's expensive.

00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:31.580
And their current
customers didn't

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.250
want to pay higher prices so
the farmer in the next county

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:37.240
can get power.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:42.900
What the federal remedy was,
we'll enable a set of co-ops.

00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:47.455
And we'll sell them cheap
power from federal facilities.

00:54:47.455 --> 00:54:48.330
That's what was done.

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.730
TVA is the most
visible sort of we'll

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:53.490
generate from federal
facilities and sell cheap.

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:56.880
But we did a bunch of it.

00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:01.080
And in 1950 when it peaked,
the federal government

00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:07.660
generated 12% of
us electricity, OK.

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.220
So far so good?

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:10.060
That's the history.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:26.080
State regulation-- so the
bulk of the regulatory effort

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:31.020
from 1907, particularly
after 1935, that's PUHCA,

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:34.370
always pronounced puka.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:39.260
State regulators required
just and reasonable rates.

00:55:39.260 --> 00:55:42.350
This was rate of
return regulation.

00:55:42.350 --> 00:55:45.410
They would set
prices in principle

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:49.697
so that the utility would just
earn a fair rate of return.

00:55:49.697 --> 00:55:51.030
You've got to have some profits.

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.740
What's a fair profit?

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.180
Well, we know what your
cost of capital is.

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.770
We'll figure out what that is.

00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:58.980
And we'll set the rates
so you just earn that.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:03.100
So what might go wrong?

00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:14.760
Alex, Shirley you're about
to raise your hand now.

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.010
I keep watching
this hand going--

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:17.760
What do you think?

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:18.600
What could go wrong?

00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.100
Anything?

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:26.750
We're going to set prices
so that you just earn

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:30.062
a reasonable rate of return.

00:56:30.062 --> 00:56:34.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what that is.

00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:37.770
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
You can get it wrong.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.300
We'll set a price.

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.540
And we'll let it.

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:46.500
Well, we'll set a price and
let's suppose we adjust it

00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:48.180
when we get surprises.

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:50.220
Or let's say, we
are worried about,

00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:52.500
and this is what they
did do after a while.

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:55.680
We know that you can't
control your cost of fuel.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.130
That's on the open market.

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:01.270
So we'll pass that
through automatically.

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:02.193
Anything else?

00:57:02.193 --> 00:57:04.360
Anything else that could
go wrong if I make sure you

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.310
just earn a reasonable
rate of return?

00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:12.400
OK, let me not torture
you, think about it.

00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:13.203
Yes.

00:57:13.203 --> 00:57:14.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the variable cost.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:18.510
They have no incentive
to try to be efficient.

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:19.910
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you would

00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:24.230
expect the big problem
would be that the cost would

00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:25.940
be too high.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:29.720
Suppose-- and we can even
sharpen that a little bit.

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:35.450
And that is the main defect
in that form of regulation.

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:38.790
Suppose we recognize
the following.

00:57:38.790 --> 00:57:41.150
If I say that a
reasonable rate of return

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:46.450
is below your cost of capital,
then you can't function, right?

00:57:46.450 --> 00:57:49.210
If you can't raise money to
invest because you can't earn

00:57:49.210 --> 00:57:53.060
enough on it, if I've set
the rate of return too low,

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.830
you can't go forward.

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:56.810
So I don't want that to happen.

00:57:56.810 --> 00:58:00.070
So I make sure you earn more
than your cost of capital

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:01.450
on the investments.

00:58:01.450 --> 00:58:03.460
I have to make sure that
every dollar you invest

00:58:03.460 --> 00:58:08.720
earns more than what it costs
you to raise that dollar?

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:12.390
What might that lead
to, just intuitively?

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:13.290
David.

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:14.728
AUDIENCE: Over-investment.

00:58:14.728 --> 00:58:16.270
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Over-investment,

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:19.450
which they referred to in the
literature as gold plating,

00:58:19.450 --> 00:58:19.950
right?

00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:23.710
If I have a choice of doing
it with three people or a $5

00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:26.590
million investment,
I'll do a $5 million

00:58:26.590 --> 00:58:28.900
investment because I'll
earn money on that.

00:58:28.900 --> 00:58:32.160
And I won't earn any
money on the three people.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.520
So you have a tendency
you would expect to have

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:38.090
capital investment too high.

00:58:38.090 --> 00:58:40.130
There are a couple
other problems,

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:41.060
we've hit two of them.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:43.730
I'll just mention the others.

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:46.760
When people talk
about this system,

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:47.795
they talk about capture.

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:57.070
Well, I actually gave a talk
at the Massachusetts Commission

00:58:57.070 --> 00:58:58.750
a couple of weeks ago.

00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:02.560
And it turns out
there's a little office

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.140
complex inside South Station.

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.390
You don't see it, but you
kind of go around the corner

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:11.140
and you go up and they
have some offices.

00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:14.470
Who do you think goes
into those offices?

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:17.290
The companies they regulate.

00:59:17.290 --> 00:59:22.320
Who do you think says nice
things to them, talks to them,

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:25.240
has any relationship
with them at all?

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:28.850
The people they regulate.

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:31.760
Who has lots of lawyers
and lots of PR people

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.000
to make a lot of noise
if they're unhappy?

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.130
The people they regulate.

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:42.470
So a strong model not an
entirely accurate model,

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:46.820
but not an entirely crazy
model is, after a while,

00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:52.520
the regulators serve
the folks they regulate.

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.650
Because you want
to make them happy.

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:57.830
You see them every day,
they come in your office.

00:59:57.830 --> 00:59:59.840
You can imagine a different
kind of relationship

00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:02.270
and sometimes you see it.

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:06.230
But one argument is, all the
consumers are not organized.

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:08.450
The utility is.

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:10.140
The electric companies
are organized.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:10.760
They have the lawyers.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.630
They have their lobbyists.

01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:12.505
They're in every day.

01:00:12.505 --> 01:00:14.720
They write the stuff.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:19.170
Those of us who only pay bills
aren't in there every day.

01:00:19.170 --> 01:00:20.280
So that's one problem.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:25.280
The other problem, it's
a more subtle problem is,

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.120
who determines who
pays what price?

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.150
And the simplest example
is, prices to industry

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:35.550
versus prices to consumers.

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:37.470
Industry takes power
at higher voltages.

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:39.450
So they ought to
pay a lower price.

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:41.128
What's the price difference?

01:00:41.128 --> 01:00:42.920
Well, I submit to you
that price difference

01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:47.450
is a political decision
as much as it is anything.

01:00:47.450 --> 01:00:49.910
And under a regulated
regime, it's

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:52.310
hard to see how it
could be anything else.

01:00:52.310 --> 01:00:55.840
OK, so this system
actually worked.

01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.590
And I'm going to answer
this question just

01:00:57.590 --> 01:01:00.740
in the interest of
our leaving today.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:04.610
This system generated almost
no complaints until the 1970s,

01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:08.590
in electric power, despite
all of these well known,

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.190
well-documented problems.

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:14.280
And the reason for
that is in electricity,

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.260
technical change was very rapid.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.820
Energy costs were pretty stable.

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:24.250
And so the price of
electricity was dropping.

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:26.740
Very often the utility
would come in and ask

01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:29.380
for a rate decrease, all right.

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.840
If you fixed my price, and
my costs keep dropping,

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.210
there comes a point at which
the price is embarrassingly

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:36.130
high above the monopoly price.

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:38.110
I'm going to make
me too much money

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:39.790
to survive political scrutiny.

01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:42.350
I'll ask for a lower price.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:44.000
So an awful lot
of that happened.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.990
That's a great system.

01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:47.550
The regulators don't
have to do much.

01:01:47.550 --> 01:01:50.950
The utility comes in and says,
may we please lower our price.

01:01:50.950 --> 01:01:51.923
We do a big fuss.

01:01:51.923 --> 01:01:52.590
We have lawyers.

01:01:52.590 --> 01:01:56.190
We write briefs, after a while
we say, yeah, lower your price.

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:57.270
We all go out to lunch.

01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:58.890
This is a good system.

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:00.900
It didn't work in
the '70s very well

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:03.535
when fuel costs began to rise.

01:02:03.535 --> 01:02:05.160
And the utilities
came in and said, now

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:07.390
let us raise our prices.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.370
And then people began
to say, wait a minute,

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:10.570
your costs are too high.

01:02:10.570 --> 01:02:12.830
You are gold plated
blah, blah, blah.

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:14.980
And it began to be nasty.

01:02:14.980 --> 01:02:20.425
OK, so let me take
this up to date.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:30.070
In the 1970s, we deregulated a
lot of things in this economy.

01:02:30.070 --> 01:02:31.920
We deregulated airlines.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.480
We deregulated trucking.

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:35.280
We deregulated railroads.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:39.590
We deregulated the wellhead
price of natural gas.

01:02:39.590 --> 01:02:43.100
And most of those worked.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:44.540
Price of natural gas went up.

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.310
But we stopped having shortages.

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:47.780
Airline prices came down.

01:02:47.780 --> 01:02:49.100
Trucking prices came down.

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.370
Railroad prices came down.

01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:51.410
And costs came down.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:57.650
And electricity
prices were going up.

01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:59.660
Fuel costs were going up.

01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:01.320
There was excess capacity.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.830
People had to pay
for that capacity.

01:03:03.830 --> 01:03:09.290
There became a move to
deregulate electricity.

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:12.750
But I just told you it
was a natural monopoly.

01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:15.770
So the first step was
this law that said,

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:17.660
you have to buy from renewables.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:20.580
And you have to buy from
combined heat and power

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:28.050
co-generation, hexion type
units at avoided cost.

01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.550
What's avoided cost?

01:03:29.550 --> 01:03:32.100
Well, each state got
to determine that.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:34.590
Big mess, there were no markets.

01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:40.200
But an interesting
step, early '80s, and I

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.110
will cite myself here because I
do tend to get cited for this.

01:03:43.110 --> 01:03:45.120
In the early '80s,
Paul Joskow and I

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:46.540
were working in this area.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:50.580
And we began to hear from people
in the Reagan administration,

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.650
all this other stuff worked.

01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:55.860
We deregulated gas and trucking
and airlines, why don't we

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.770
just deregulate electricity.

01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:02.040
Why don't we just let the market
determine electricity prices?

01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.690
I have to say, the words
natural monopoly came to mind.

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:11.100
You're not going to have
competition in transmission.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:15.000
You're not going to have
competition in distribution.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.080
But you know you could have
competition in generation.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:20.840
It's not like there's
only one generating

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.450
plant per city or per state.

01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:25.330
There are a bunch of them.

01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:26.570
So maybe you could.

01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:28.790
So we actually wrote a book
called Markets for Power

01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:32.570
that people tell me was
influential more outside the US

01:04:32.570 --> 01:04:34.100
than in.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.230
But we said well, you could
do it if you were careful.

01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:41.830
If you were careful, and you
worried about market power,

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:43.977
and you worried about
the proper rules,

01:04:43.977 --> 01:04:46.060
and you worried about a
half a dozen other things,

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:49.510
you could actually
deregulate generation.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:51.250
Well, it happened.

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.410
And I don't claim
credit for this.

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:56.380
It was mostly because the
Thatcher administration

01:04:56.380 --> 01:04:58.410
in England needed money.

01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:02.370
So they sold the
electric power system.

01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:03.880
This was a shock.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.780
It had happened in Chile
a few years earlier,

01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:09.440
nobody noticed Chile, besides
they did it in Spanish.

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.470
But in England and
Wales, they did it.

01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:18.050
They kept the grid, the
transmission system together.

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:20.630
They regulated the
distribution companies,

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:23.160
but they sold the generators.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:24.988
They sold the generators.

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.270
This was pretty exciting stuff.

01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:34.160
And it actually
worked, not perfectly.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:37.220
They had monopoly power problems
in generation in some areas.

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:38.900
They had to make changes.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.100
But it sort of worked.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:42.760
Other countries
started to follow.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.290
We started to follow.

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:50.340
Suddenly transmission
lines had to be

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.920
willing to carry anybody's
power from anybody to anybody

01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:55.830
just like trucks do.

01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:59.280
The FERC set up, independent
system operators, they

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.150
set up a regime where you could
have one entity run the system,

01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:05.280
not own it, but run it.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.360
And you could have wholesale
markets for electricity.

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.390
Some people did it, and
I'll show you what happened.

01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:15.130
Then we had California.

01:06:15.130 --> 01:06:17.520
Who's from California?

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:19.300
Was that fun?

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.770
That was not fun.

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:25.270
Prices went crazy in
California, around 2000, 2001.

01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:26.980
There were blackouts.

01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:28.210
There was screaming.

01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:29.500
There was political crisis.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.840
There was Enron doing
various interesting things.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:36.820
There's litigation, which
may now have finished.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:46.227
I'm not sure about who did
what to whom, reform stopped.

01:06:46.227 --> 01:06:47.560
We'll say a little bit about it.

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:52.230
But let me just say
sort of where we are.

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:54.660
So basically nothing's
happened since California

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:56.460
to a first approximation.

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:59.580
But a lot happened
before California.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:04.980
So there is competition
in generation.

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.480
Generators sell into a market.

01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:13.600
In England and Wales, it's the
core European Union policy.

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.600
All these state owned monopolies
are moving toward markets,

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.580
dramatically, dramatically.

01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.160
And about 2/3 of US consumers
are served by markets.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.170
This is the picture.

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:25.480
The colored areas are roughly--

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.550
they change slightly over time--

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:31.700
roughly the boundaries of
organized wholesale markets.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.880
So in New England, I
showed you these day

01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:35.950
ahead clearing demands.

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:39.340
And I'll show you some
prices in a little bit.

01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:43.090
This part of Texas runs
a very nice market.

01:07:43.090 --> 01:07:47.650
California after
a while restarted.

01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:51.070
This part of the country
is traditional, vertically

01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:52.190
integrated.

01:07:52.190 --> 01:07:52.870
We generate.

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:53.590
We transmit.

01:07:53.590 --> 01:07:54.340
We distribute.

01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:57.340
What's a market utilities.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:08:01.270
In the West, the federal
government has a huge presence,

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:05.260
operates a lot of the
transmission system.

01:08:05.260 --> 01:08:07.600
There are sort of elements
of market, but not really.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.580
And there's an awful
lot of preference power.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:12.320
Because there's a lot of
government-owned hydro.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.230
If you go up the Columbia
River, you pass a dam after dam

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:19.960
after dam which you all own.

01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.710
So New England, one
of the earlier ones,

01:08:23.710 --> 01:08:27.439
very nice little market.

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:29.950
These are average
wholesale prices

01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:34.000
in New England
for the last year.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.200
The prices are hourly I think.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.950
Maybe they've gone
down to 15 minutes now.

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:40.450
But at least hourly.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:44.870
They also are
differentiated by region.

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:47.990
If there's a problem
transmitting power from A to B,

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:50.870
the prices in A
and B can differ.

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:53.990
If there is no problem,
they differ trivially.

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:56.540
So again, this is
the day ahead price,

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.069
and this is the real time price.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:05.149
I don't know what happened
last August, or late July,

01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:07.580
whether that was a
particularly hot day.

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.270
It was clearly anticipated.

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:15.620
You see the blue shot
up as well as the green.

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:17.390
Sometimes the day
ahead is too high.

01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:19.670
Sometimes the day
ahead is too low.

01:09:19.670 --> 01:09:21.319
There is a day ahead market.

01:09:21.319 --> 01:09:23.510
And then there is
what actually has

01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:25.620
to happen to follow the load.

01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:31.370
So sometimes the day
ahead market overestimates

01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:32.899
demand and thus costs.

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:34.580
Sometimes it underestimates.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:39.649
But those are daily prices.

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:45.710
I'll show you some
hourly prices on Monday.

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:49.010
And here's what
the US looks like.

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:50.930
No other country
has a system that

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:55.390
is this fragmented and diverse,
with the possible exception

01:09:55.390 --> 01:09:57.790
of Japan depending on how
you count fragmentation

01:09:57.790 --> 01:10:00.940
and diversity,
since half of Japan

01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.220
runs on 50 cycles a
second and half of Japan

01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:05.630
runs on 60 cycles.

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:08.230
We at least beat that.

01:10:08.230 --> 01:10:13.210
So about 2/3 are served
by organized markets.

01:10:13.210 --> 01:10:15.400
ISO is Independent
System Operator,

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.400
RTO is Regional
Transmission Operator.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:21.200
Differences are immaterial.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.020
We have a transmission
system owned

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:27.700
by about 450 different entities,
some federal, some local,

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.770
some state, some private.

01:10:29.770 --> 01:10:35.660
About 2/3 of the system
is owned by private firms.

01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:40.880
We have on the order
of 3,200 entities

01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:48.020
selling electricity, 3,200
entities selling electricity.

01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:50.090
Cooperatives aren't
regulated by anybody.

01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:53.360
Investor owned utilities,
which are about 2/3

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:56.150
regulated by states and by feds.

01:10:56.150 --> 01:10:57.890
The munis and the
federal systems

01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:00.530
are not regulated by anybody.

01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:05.270
And that retail
competitors at the bottom

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:08.585
is a development that was
under way before California.

01:11:08.585 --> 01:11:13.310
It has gotten stalled
because of California.

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:18.530
But in Texas is where
it's most prevalent.

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:22.100
You can buy electricity
from any one

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:23.750
of a number of competing firms.

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:28.670
It will be delivered by the
monopoly distribution company.

01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:31.400
But you will pay for it
to some other firm that's

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.610
responsible for making sure
there's enough electricity

01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:36.360
to serve its customers.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.540
That's the model in Europe.

01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:43.850
It exists in Massachusetts,
but isn't very effective.

01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:46.580
Just last week I got
my first solicitation--

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.320
this has been 10 years--

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.030
to switch suppliers.

01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:53.120
And because I believe
in computation, I did.

01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.950
So there's enough
retail competition

01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:57.820
that people who
don't own wires--

01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.570
plus I thought I'd see
what would happen--

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:04.550
plus people who don't own wires
sold 8% of the electricity

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:06.440
in the country.

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:08.930
I think these are 2010 numbers.

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:10.880
That's a big change.

01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.560
That was 0.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.850
The bigger change is
on the generation side.

01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:18.920
So you have government systems--

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.100
and this is a big number, 16%.

01:12:22.100 --> 01:12:25.610
Not all federal, some
state, some municipal,

01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:28.070
Los Angeles for instance, 16%.

01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:30.080
Investor owned utilities
with retail sales,

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.530
42%, independent
producers, folks

01:12:33.530 --> 01:12:37.040
who have entered the wholesale
market who do not sell directly

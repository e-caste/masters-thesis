00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:23.280
MICHAEL SHORT: All right, guys.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.400
Welcome to the last
official day of 22.01.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.350
Can't believe we've
actually made it here.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.290
And you guys have
learned a ton about how

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.480
ionizing radiation
does and doesn't affect

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.800
different types of matter.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.750
If you've noticed that
the whole class has

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.360
been kind of taking a slant
towards looking at issues

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.000
in the public sphere
from things like hormesis

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.310
to dose, to risk,
to power plants,

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.800
today we're going to talk
about food irradiation.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.300
One of the main
reasons that we have

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.190
all sorts of incredibly
safe food today

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.950
thanks to ionizing
radiation, a lot of the myths

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.720
and misconceptions and
science behind what does

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.840
and what doesn't happen
when you irradiate food.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.673
And you guys are fully
equipped to determine

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:02.370
not just is food irradiation
safe, but how should

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.090
it be conducted?

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.640
How should it not be conducted
and what would the effects

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.570
really be?

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.000
And with stuff that we did
the last few classes, actually

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.200
looking up research papers and
discerning which sources are

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.890
real and which ones
are, let's just say,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.480
not, for lack of a bunch
of four letter words,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.230
you can tell for yourselves
what sources are actually

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.490
worth looking at.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.760
So just quickly go over the
basics of food irradiation

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.400
and maybe five minutes before
we hit the primary sources.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.260
So the general idea
here for anyone

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.130
that got into the reading,
which I'll pull up right here,

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.160
is that we irradiate
food to do a whole bunch

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.113
of different things.

00:01:39.113 --> 00:01:41.280
Can anyone tell me, what
are some of the reasons one

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.975
might irradiate food?

00:01:44.975 --> 00:01:47.600
AUDIENCE: Bacteria like E. coli

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.350
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
gets rid of bacteria,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.520
other harmful organisms.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.860
It just kills other organisms.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.090
Like what?

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.920
Like bacteria.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.840
Anyone else?

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.520
AUDIENCE: Bugs.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.870
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes, insects.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.260
It's actually used to either
kill or sterilize insects

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.090
so that they don't
breathe and let's say--

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.550
oh yeah, totally,
because the dose required

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.530
to sterilize
something is usually

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.030
a lot lower than the dose
required to kill something.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.050
Why do you guys think that is?

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.550
Yeah?

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.758
AUDIENCE: To sterilize
[INAUDIBLE] all you have to do

00:02:18.758 --> 00:02:20.623
is kill off your
reproductive cells.

00:02:20.623 --> 00:02:21.790
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.707
And anyone remember what
those quality factors

00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:26.100
look like for those
reproductive cells?

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.283
AUDIENCE: Much higher.

00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:28.450
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.950
Let me bring it up.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.940
Let me go into the dose
dosimetry and background.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.930
I think it'll help to
actually see the numbers here.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.300
Let's go to the tissue
quality factors.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.530
There we go.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.920
Right at the top of the
list, reproductive organs.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.560
So it takes a whole lot less
dose to sterilize something

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.160
like insects or other
bacteria or things,

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.160
or I don't know if you
can say sterilize viruses.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.380
It's still kind of under
debate whether viruses

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.030
are technically alive.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.133
They're right on that
edge of what people

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:01.300
would consider alive or not.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.758
And there's still
a debate going on

00:03:02.758 --> 00:03:05.470
about what does
alive really mean.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.100
Yeah.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.110
You can sterilize the
insect population.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.090
For example, who here's
bought a bag of rice before,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.180
and who here has found
some little rice bugs

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.990
in that bag of rice before?

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.500
Are you serious?

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.250
I must shop at cheap store,
I find them all the time.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.250
But the nice thing is if
you irradiate them then

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.890
they won't breed and continue
to eat and breed in the bag

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.390
and then you open
the bag and you've

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.790
got a swarm of, I don't
know what those things are,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.290
rice weevils or something.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.915
I think I remember looking them
up once because I was like what

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:34.330
is this thing in the rice?

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.350
Yeah, it's gross.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.980
But that's why we
do food irradiation.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.650
Now, what else?

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.400
What other reasons
might want to irradiate

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.770
food other than to kill
or sterilize things in it?

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.710
Yeah?

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.260
AUDIENCE: Doesn't it
preserve like shelf lifes?

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.510
MICHAEL SHORT: It does
preserve shelf life, especially

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.440
of things like fresh fruits,
vegetables, seeds, legumes.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.730
Anyone have any idea why?

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.380
Yeah?

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.880
AUDIENCE: Well, it seemed like
that would be just because it

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.932
kills things that eat it.

00:04:05.932 --> 00:04:06.800
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.580
One would be it kills
things that eat it,

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.320
but the other thing
is those plants have

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.550
reproductive cells as well.

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.750
Let's pick a good example.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.070
Anyone ever had really well
sprouted bean sprouts before?

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.830
Like not the fresh ones,
but the really old ones?

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.900
Not old like they've sat
behind the fridge or something.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:30.400
OK.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.850
AUDIENCE: Like super sprouted?

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.600
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
super crazy sprouted.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.600
AUDIENCE: The super
crazy sprouted.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.330
MICHAEL SHORT: Anyone
remember what they taste like?

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.680
They are kind of bitter
and rather unpleasant.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.350
So one of the main reasons
for irradiating food

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.770
is to prevent sprouting
and prevent germination

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.270
because as soon as the plant
sprouts and starts to say like,

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.750
all right, let's grow, starts
to consume its store of sugars,

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.820
water, nutrients
and everything else

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.920
and start generating
other flavors, which

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.200
tend to be fairly off flavors.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.490
So another way that you can
keep things tasting good,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.850
even if they don't have bugs or
weevils or insects or viruses

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.680
in them, is prevent
them from changing

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.760
at all through their
normal metabolic processes.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.155
So it kind of freezes
the food in place.

00:05:15.155 --> 00:05:16.530
Well, since I
mentioned freezing,

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.490
there's another
little caveat to that.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.800
At what temperature do you
think would be the best

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.340
temperature to irradiate food?

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.580
AUDIENCE: Cold temperatures.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.823
MICHAEL SHORT: You say
cold, and why do you say so?

00:05:26.823 --> 00:05:30.530
AUDIENCE: When you did that one
thing, the temperature'd grow.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.450
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
let's bring it up.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.000
We talked about G-values
and temperature,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.140
and I think it's a
little further in.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.440
It's in the chemical effects.

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.520
So I'll jog your guy's memory
a bit from just a week ago

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.410
where we were talking
about G-values

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.180
or the number of different
radiolytic byproducts

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:54.990
of radiolysis byproducts
that are formed

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.350
as a function of temperature.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.350
I'm not going to full
screen that because that's

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:59.532
going to get all freaky.

00:05:59.532 --> 00:06:01.740
But you can see that there's
a whole lot more of them

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.780
formed as a function
of temperature.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.450
What's not shown here
is what happens when

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.345
this reaches 0 degrees Celsius?

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:18.100
What happens to water
at 0 degrees Celsius?

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.900
Just look outside,
what do we got?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.160
It freezes, OK.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.020
All these G-values
are calculated

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.420
assuming the free species are
diffusing in liquid water.

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.400
When you freeze the
food, you pretty much

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.620
shut down diffusion.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.180
When you shut down diffusion,
do these chemicals react or not

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.420
in a different way?

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:40.633
Can they move to
find each other?

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:41.800
No, they're frozen in place.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.930
You're stuck at the
diffusion coefficient

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.480
in ice, which is
a whole lot slower

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.640
than in free flowing water.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.120
So in this way, you can kill
whatever organisms are there

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.210
even if they can survive
freezing by directly damaging

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.800
their DNA, without altering
as many of the foods

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.000
normal tastes, flavors,
colors, whatever.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.680
And speaking of
taste flavors colors,

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.160
I want to bring up some
of the pseudoscience.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.830
It didn't take long to
find a couple of things

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.690
on the internet
talking about how we

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.910
shouldn't eat irradiated food.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.740
And to that I say,
well next time

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.960
you spend five weeks
straight on the toilet

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.840
you may be thankful
for food irradiation.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.510
So let's look to see
what sort of things

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.430
could or couldn't happen
with food irradiation

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.280
based on random
internet article.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.270
Again, not a useful source,
but let's see what they say.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.490
Damages food by breaking
up molecules and creating

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.210
free radicals.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.147
That's true.

00:07:39.147 --> 00:07:41.355
What's the question we should
be asking though is not

00:07:41.355 --> 00:07:42.723
does it damage molecules?

00:07:42.723 --> 00:07:43.640
But what do you think?

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:47.535
Yeah?

00:07:47.535 --> 00:07:49.987
AUDIENCE: Do the damaged
molecules have any effect?

00:07:49.987 --> 00:07:50.820
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.610
So one, do the damaged
molecules have any effect?

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:55.990
Were those same damaged
molecules there to begin with?

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:58.800
And the other question I
want to ask is how much?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.112
How much is always
the question you

00:08:01.112 --> 00:08:02.820
want to come back with
when somebody says

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.390
isn't it true that radiation
does binary effect?

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.586
Causes cancer, kills
babies, whatever you want?

00:08:10.586 --> 00:08:11.430
Sure, enough.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:13.830
But the question is how much?

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.070
So there's a second
source top 10 reasons

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.293
for opposing food irradiation.

00:08:19.293 --> 00:08:21.210
Let's go through these
a little bit one by one

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:23.418
and look at some of the
references, which they're not

00:08:23.418 --> 00:08:24.840
all bad.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.590
So let's see.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.020
In legalizing food
irradiation we

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.500
did not determine a level which
food can be exposed and still

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.909
be safe for human consumption.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.490
So let's think about
what that actually means.

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.850
We never hit that LD
50 or LD 10 or whatever

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.350
dose we found that will
cause ill effects in humans.

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.880
I would argue this
is a good thing.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.550
If we haven't had any documented
cases of people getting

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.000
sick from food
irradiation and we already

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.910
get the effects that we want
like stopping germination,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.250
sprouting, killing bad
things, then great,

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.660
let's not go higher.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.890
Mission accomplished.

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.800
Let's look at the
references again.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.470
Reference one, they
actually give a US code

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:06.580
of federal regulations.

00:09:06.580 --> 00:09:09.890
Reference two, I
dare you to find

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:12.560
what they were talking about.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.230
Various filings over
a period of 17 years.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.460
AUDIENCE: Isn't that dating
publication Federal Register?

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.900
MICHAEL SHORT: I'm not sure.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.180
I think it might be
something more legit,

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.430
but there may also be a
publication called the Federal

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:26.330
Register.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.310
I doubt the Federal
Register publication has

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:30.977
what's called filings, but these
would be more official filings.

00:09:30.977 --> 00:09:34.022
But yeah, they're somewhere
in the archives of somewhere.

00:09:34.022 --> 00:09:34.730
But at any rate--

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.905
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
from class.

00:09:37.905 --> 00:09:40.280
MICHAEL SHORT: Again, I would
argue that this is actually

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:40.830
a good thing.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:45.015
We don't know to what level food
irradiation can harm people.

00:09:45.015 --> 00:09:46.640
Now, let's think
about some of the ways

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.502
in which if done incorrectly
it could harm people.

00:09:49.502 --> 00:09:51.460
Without me telling you
ahead of time-- and this

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:53.390
we'll see who did a
little bit of the reading.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:54.950
--what sort of
types of radiation

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.920
do we use to irradiate
food, and why?

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:04.880
We have our choice of alphas,
betas, positrons, gammas,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.630
neutrons, heavy ions, et cetera.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.620
What would you use, and why?

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:13.120
Yeah?

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.620
AUDIENCE: Presumably
ionizing so you

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.212
don't have to activate any
of the things [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:18.212 --> 00:10:20.260
MICHAEL SHORT: So you
said presumably ionizing.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.596
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so you
don't activate them

00:10:21.596 --> 00:10:22.940
and you get
radioactive thiamine.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.590
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.548
Which of these types of
radiation are ionizing?

00:10:25.548 --> 00:10:28.902
AUDIENCE: Sulphur,
[INAUDIBLE],, gamma.

00:10:28.902 --> 00:10:30.735
MICHAEL SHORT: What do
you mean by ionizing?

00:10:30.735 --> 00:10:33.370
AUDIENCE: So they can lead to
ionizations in the material.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.180
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.513
I would argue that every one
of these types of radiation

00:10:36.513 --> 00:10:37.228
can ionize.

00:10:37.228 --> 00:10:38.770
As we've seen, they
can all knock out

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.270
electrons or other nuclei.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:42.580
But you're getting at
an important point.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.110
Can anyone help Alex clarify?

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:46.460
because you're getting
onto the right track.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:47.646
Anyone?

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:48.146
Yeah?

00:10:48.146 --> 00:10:49.592
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:56.480
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.370
So you may not want to
use heavy ions or alphas

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.720
because you don't want to
plant anything in the material.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.387
Are you worried about
implanting helium?

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.187
What about iron?

00:11:06.187 --> 00:11:08.020
I mean let's say you
want to use carbon ions

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.800
and the food is Carboniferous.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.880
That's OK.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.533
But what about some of
these types of radiation

00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:16.200
are quite different
from the others when

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.200
we were talking about
everything from gamma

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.510
to charged particle to
neutron interactions?

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.160
What sort of things
might we look

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.920
at as criteria to
determine whether or not

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:30.360
we want to use this
for food irradiation?

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.800
Stopping power.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.450
So stopping power, which is
related directly to range.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.540
So let's pick an
energy of around 1 MeV.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.880
How do you find the range
of 1 MeV alphas in food?

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:47.920
Great.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.660
That's what I was
going to say too.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.160
You can either do
the calculations,

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.320
or like most of us
actually do, we just

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.000
run a quick simulation
that integrates

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
all those calculations.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.880
So let's do that right now.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:04.540
So we will take one MeV
helium or 1,000k EV helium.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.170
We will approximate
food as water

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.860
with a stoichiometry
of 2 to 1, a density

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:18.820
of 1 gram per cubic centimeter,
and let's allow for--

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.170
I think I already know what
the answer is going to be.

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:23.105
--10 microns.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.950
What are we getting for a range?

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:32.870
5, 6 microns for alpha
particles in water.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.320
How well would alpha
particles sterilize food?

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.060
Not.

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:44.320
So let's say you have
a chicken with diameter

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.210
around 40 centimeters.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:52.400
The alpha particles would
penetrate the chicken

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.280
to a depth of
approximately 6 microns.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.310
So alpha particles
are probably out.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.430
What else is out
based on range alone?

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:03.530
Heavy ions.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.220
How far do you think ion ions
would penetrate into a chicken?

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.030
Not far at all.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:10.880
Let's find out.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:15.110
Iron ions, I'm going to
shrink the scale to 1 micron.

00:13:18.272 --> 00:13:20.605
We actually kind of did this
on the homework, didn't we?

00:13:20.605 --> 00:13:24.872
I had you guys look at the range
of lighter and heavier ions.

00:13:24.872 --> 00:13:26.330
What I'm hoping is
that you'll have

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:28.460
some sort of an intuition
for how far ions

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:29.430
tend to go in material.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:34.310
So as you go heavier, does
the range go up or down?

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.050
Range goes down.

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:39.560
As we expect we're getting
just about 2 microns of chicken

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.930
with heavy iron ions.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.130
So what could you do to get
those to penetrate farther?

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.190
Yeah, so you could
boost the energy.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.500
So if you were to boost
the energy of the alphas--

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:54.000
let's see.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.960
First of all, with our
typical range relation

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.040
where a range is roughly
proportional to kinetic energy

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.878
squared, how much
more energy would we

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.920
have to impart to the
alphas in order to get them

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:09.600
to the center of the chicken?

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:14.100
Well let's try and work it out.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:22.140
The range was about 6 microns
and an energy of 1 MeV

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.690
and we want to get to
about 20 centimeters.

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:27.900
Let's call that 6 centimeters.

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.920
We're just going to use
this approximation for now.

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.630
And if we want to go from
6 microns to 6 centimeters,

00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.983
that is four orders
of magnitude.

00:14:41.983 --> 00:14:43.650
So how many orders
of magnitude would we

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:47.260
need to increase the energy
of the alphas to get through?

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:47.760
OK.

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.910
So we'd have to go to,
let's say, 100 MeV you said.

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:52.780
Let's find out.

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.750
We can just check this.

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:59.170
So we'll switch back
to alphas at 100 MeV.

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:02.830
This is already looking
to be fairly uneconomical.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.910
But this is physics,
so let's find out.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.130
OK.

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:10.920
So we're at about
1.5 centimeters.

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.870
And that's again
because at high energies

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:18.030
this range relation changes
to about proportional

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.778
to t for really high energies.

00:15:20.778 --> 00:15:22.320
So we know we're
going to have to get

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:27.210
to around a GeV alphas in order
to food irradiate chicken.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.650
That sounds really expensive.

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:29.310
Yeah.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.610
The proton cyclotron and
MGH is about 250 MeV,

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:37.290
and we're talking an eight
or nine figure installation.

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:39.270
Not worth it to irradiate food.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:43.540
What else might go wrong
with GeV alpha particles?

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:45.930
What may you induce?

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:46.430
Yeah?

00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:47.900
AUDIENCE: Bremsstrahlung
radiation.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:49.858
MICHAEL SHORT: Lot of
Bremsstrahlung radiation.

00:15:49.858 --> 00:15:52.790
We pretty much ignored
Bremsstrahlung of things

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.570
like alpha particles
and protons.

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:58.577
But once you get into the GeV
or tera electron volt range,

00:15:58.577 --> 00:16:00.410
you are going to get a
lot of Bremsstrahlung

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:02.700
and shielding those x-rays
is going to be a mess.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:03.200
OK.

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.513
So let's say we've
excluded alphas and ions

00:16:07.513 --> 00:16:08.930
for the purposes
of physics and we

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.720
are left with batas,
positrons, gamma and neutrons.

00:16:14.205 --> 00:16:14.705
What next?

00:16:17.582 --> 00:16:19.720
AUDIENCE: Neutrons
are also expensive.

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.610
MICHAEL SHORT:
Neutrons are expensive.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:25.090
You either need a reactor,
a spallation source,

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.600
or a little pulsed fusion
device, two of which

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.280
we have down the street.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.342
Let's say you had a
cheap source of neutrons.

00:16:32.342 --> 00:16:34.300
One of those, if you
build it and there's money

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.032
to be made then they will-- no.

00:16:36.032 --> 00:16:37.990
If there's money to be
made they will build it,

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:40.282
and if you build it, they
will come with their chickens

00:16:40.282 --> 00:16:41.500
for irradiation.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.890
Why else physically would
you not want to use neutrons

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.210
to irradiate food?

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.077
AUDIENCE: They
damage everything.

00:16:48.077 --> 00:16:49.660
MICHAEL SHORT: They
damage everything.

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.280
That's OK, right?

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.730
If they're damaging living
organisms more than the food

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.470
itself, that's OK.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.650
But what do neutrons tend to do
when they interact with matter?

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.620
And that's as specific as I
can make the question so far.

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.579
The correct answer
is everything.

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:10.079
Like what?

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:10.815
Chris?

00:17:10.815 --> 00:17:13.603
AUDIENCE: Well, like Alex
said, they could activate--

00:17:13.603 --> 00:17:14.297
[AUDIO OUT]

00:17:14.297 --> 00:17:15.089
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:17:15.089 --> 00:17:17.422
So that's when I said you're
getting on the right track.

00:17:17.422 --> 00:17:20.010
So thanks you guys for
doing a team tag answer.

00:17:20.010 --> 00:17:22.935
Yes, they can activate things
at pretty much any energy.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.540
For this I'm going
to jump to Janis.

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.200
Like I said, I like
to do things live,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.260
so show you guys that we
could do it on the fly

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.950
and respond to your
comments in real time.

00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:39.080
It is showing, good.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:39.680
OK.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.240
Though this is a skill
I want to make sure

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:42.740
that by the end of
this class, which

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.020
is about 35 minutes
from now, you guys will

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:47.248
know to jump to Janis
and start looking

00:17:47.248 --> 00:17:49.040
for the right cross-sections
because you're

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.030
going to need it for the rest
of your life career time at MIT.

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.760
Pick probably two
out of the three

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:58.060
if you guys are going to
be nuclear somethings.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:00.380
I'm definitely in a
different database right now.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:03.260
I was in incident proton
data for other things

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:05.240
that will become apparent soon.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.827
Let's go back to
incident neutron data.

00:18:07.827 --> 00:18:09.410
We'll use the same
database that we've

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:13.010
been using all the time, the
ENDF most recent database.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:17.950
Look at the cross-sections
and let's assume

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.110
you had some iron in your food.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:21.580
You are irradiating red meat.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.380
Nickel, copper, iron.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:30.815
Pretty common isotope of
iron could be iron 58.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.810
Let's now go down
and find the z gamma

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:42.020
the neutron capture
cross-section for iron 58.

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.830
It's decidedly non-zero at
all energies, which means

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.540
you're going to make iron 59.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.038
What happens when
you make iron 59?

00:18:51.038 --> 00:18:52.580
I don't expect you
to know, but where

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:53.705
do we go to get the answer?

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.700
Wall, yep, Tyree,
that wall, the table

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:02.520
of nuclides, whatever you
want, or the Brookhaven table,

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:03.270
whatever you want.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.080
The point is the
table of nuclides.

00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.705
Let's take a look at iron
59 and see what it does.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.400
It is not stable.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.780
It has a half life of
greater than 10 days.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:19.340
It's a beta emitter
and it beta decays

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.770
to cobalt 59, which
is a stable isotope.

00:19:22.770 --> 00:19:25.010
So you would be creating
an unjustable source

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.690
of beta particles.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.530
Nasty stuff.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.140
Let's see what those
beta particles would do.

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.240
They have about
a 1.5 MeV energy.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:37.700
Let's look at the decay diagram.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.310
There are a few transitions,
the most likely of which

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:45.720
would give a beta and a gamma,
the most two likely of which

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.760
would give a beta and a gamma.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.740
So you'd be ingesting a
dual beta gamma emitter.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.520
Now, to find out how far
would those betas go,

00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:57.080
as in are they energetic
enough to escape you or not,

00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.000
what do you use?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:04.020
MICHAEL SHORT:
[INAUDIBLE] electrons.

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.300
AUDIENCE: Calculations.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.330
MICHAEL SHORT: Back
to calculations.

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.872
Or I want to show you guys there
is a database for everything

00:20:08.872 --> 00:20:11.588
and it's always on NIST.

00:20:11.588 --> 00:20:14.130
I wonder if any of you guys have
found these for the homework

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:15.922
because I didn't use
them in the solutions,

00:20:15.922 --> 00:20:19.410
but they're quite useful.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.540
NIST has a database
called ESTAR,

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:24.780
stopping powers for electrons
where you can simply

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.420
say graph the total
stopping power

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:34.980
or range for electrons
in elements or materials.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.793
Materials, let's call
food as soft tissue.

00:20:39.793 --> 00:20:41.460
They don't have that,
let's go to water.

00:20:44.406 --> 00:20:47.980
And it gives you the range
of electrons in grams

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.603
per square centimeter in water.

00:20:51.603 --> 00:20:53.020
What do we have
to do to make this

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.390
into an actual range
in centimeters?

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:01.840
AUDIENCE: You divide by density.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.990
MICHAEL SHORT:
Multiply by density.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:06.085
Yeah, I'm sorry,
divide in this case.

00:21:06.085 --> 00:21:08.830
So you have the range in
grams per square centimeter.

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:10.690
If you divide by
density you're left

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:12.550
with centimeters on the top.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.390
The density of liquid
water is about 1.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.380
So in the case of water, you
can simply read off this table

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:20.950
if you're talking water at
25 C. So a beta particle

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:24.390
with an energy of
about 1.5 MeV has

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:29.100
a range of about a
centimeter in material.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.290
Not something you'd
want to ingest

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.440
because around 1 centimeter away
from wherever the betas end up

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.120
they would do a
whole lot of damage

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:39.420
at the end of their range where
they have the highest stopping

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:40.410
power.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:46.050
So we for many, many
reasons, least of which

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:50.620
is activation, neutrons are out.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.830
So we do not irradiate
food with neutrons

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:56.015
because they will
induce radiotoxicity.

00:21:56.015 --> 00:21:57.390
So for anyone that
tells you, oh,

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:59.550
don't you stick food in a
reactor to irradiate it,

00:21:59.550 --> 00:22:01.530
the answer is definitely not.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:03.360
You don't want neutrons nearby.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:07.720
So we're left with different
types of betas and gammas.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.640
From our study
right here we just

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:13.510
found out that betas
penetrate about 1 centimeter

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:16.780
into materials at 1.5 MeV.

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:18.992
So how energetic do we
have to get them to get

00:22:18.992 --> 00:22:20.200
to the center of the chicken?

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.220
If range is proportional
to t squared

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:33.920
and our range at 1 MeV or 1.5
MeV is about 1 centimeter--

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.660
if we want to go
to 20 centimeters,

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.130
about how much more
energetic do we

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.590
have to get the betas to
irradiate the whole chicken?

00:22:45.013 --> 00:22:48.620
AUDIENCE: At least
10 times [INAUDIBLE]..

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:49.120
Probably.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.703
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
go with 10 times.

00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:55.150
Let's go to 15 MeV, and we
can just read off this chart.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:23:00.730
At 15 MeV we're
getting on about--

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.830
now keep in mind, this
appears to be a double log

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.290
scale, so that right there is
10, that right there is 100.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:08.990
Yeah, we're getting
towards 10 centimeters.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.150
If we want to see
where it is at 20,

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:14.230
the log marker line
is kind of missing,

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.400
but it comes to about here.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:21.760
If we go down, we're
getting around 30 or 40 MeV.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.830
How reasonable does that
sound for linear accelerator?

00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:26.850
Fairly.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:28.620
It's not unreasonable.

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.030
It would still be big.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.520
Yeah, it may not be efficient,
so we may not use betas

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.267
to irradiate entire chickens.

00:23:35.267 --> 00:23:37.600
What if you're irradiating
strawberries that are roughly

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.560
about a centimeter in diameter?

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.710
How does a 1 MeV linac sound?

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:45.380
We've got some of those.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:45.900
Yeah.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.030
We've got a 2.5 MeV linac
just down the street

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.850
in building N40.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.110
So that's totally OK.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:56.910
You could use betas in order
to irradiate thin enough foods,

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.730
food for which you
can reach the center

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:02.090
with the range of the betas.

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.970
Do you induce any
significant radiotoxicity?

00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.108
How do you find out?

00:24:11.108 --> 00:24:12.920
AUDIENCE: Experiments.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.720
MICHAEL SHORT: You
could run an experiment.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.015
Or what database would you jump
to to try to figure this out?

00:24:18.015 --> 00:24:18.848
AUDIENCE: Janis.

00:24:18.848 --> 00:24:20.390
MICHAEL SHORT: I
would jump to Janis.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.520
So let's go back there.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:29.020
Let's see if they have the
incident electron data.

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.630
Yes, incident electron
data, the EXFOR database.

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.070
It's good for charged particles.

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:38.367
Let's look at iron 56.

00:24:38.367 --> 00:24:39.950
Let's say you're
irradiating red meat.

00:24:44.261 --> 00:24:46.350
I think this is just
total cross-section,

00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:49.780
so that's not going
to tell us much.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:56.210
It's also not loading and had
an error, and another error.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.780
Interesting.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.190
All right.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.710
Let's see if we have any other
interesting isotopes that

00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.250
have any good reactions.

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:06.920
Guess not.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.960
All right.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.760
Well at any rate,
it's awfully difficult

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:13.077
to induce radiotoxicity
with betas.

00:25:13.077 --> 00:25:14.660
There's another one
I didn't get into,

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.035
which would be
protons, somewhere

00:25:16.035 --> 00:25:20.828
between alphas and betas
in terms of range and such.

00:25:20.828 --> 00:25:22.370
Does anyone know,
perhaps anyone that

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.210
works in the vault, what happens
when you give very high energy

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.406
protons?

00:25:27.406 --> 00:25:30.003
AUDIENCE: A lot of
gammas and neutrons.

00:25:30.003 --> 00:25:30.920
MICHAEL SHORT: Indeed.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.360
A lot of gammas and neutrons.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.150
The gammas, maybe no problem
at the irradiation facility;

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:37.970
the neutrons, big problem.

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.930
So find it again.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:42.493
We head to Janis, look at
the incident proton data.

00:25:42.493 --> 00:25:43.910
I've already scoped
this out and I

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.650
know it's on the EXFOR
database of cross-sections.

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:54.530
Let's go right back
up to our iron 56.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:57.710
So assume we're
irradiating red meat.

00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:59.270
What sort of
reactions do we have?

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:06.675
Proton, n, something
with a few points to it.

00:26:06.675 --> 00:26:10.460
A-ha, a non-zero cross-section.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:13.970
So typically in the
range of five to 10 MeV,

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.760
high energy protons will
start to create neutrons

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.010
where a proton will come
in, a neutron will come out.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:25.070
So you would absolutely not
want to use protons above,

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:28.100
let's say a safe
limit, of around 3 MeV.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.600
Then the problem
is what's the range

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:33.630
of 3 MeV protons and stuff?

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:35.820
Anyone have a
intuition for that?

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:39.870
Pretty small.

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.140
If you don't know generally
the order of magnitude,

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:45.170
we'll head back to here to TRIM.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:50.975
We'll use 3 MeV protons.

00:26:50.975 --> 00:26:54.110
It's looking about a
millimeter of material.

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.700
We're getting about
200 microns in.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.480
Not useful enough to be
useful for any sort of food

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:00.110
irradiation.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:04.880
So protons again are out
for reasons of both neutron

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.417
activation and range.

00:27:07.417 --> 00:27:09.285
AUDIENCE: When
people [INAUDIBLE],,

00:27:09.285 --> 00:27:11.027
it's like I sit next
to it all the time.

00:27:11.027 --> 00:27:11.860
MICHAEL SHORT: Sure.

00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:15.135
But what energy are the
protons that you're making?

00:27:15.135 --> 00:27:17.218
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean we
did a lot of low energy,

00:27:17.218 --> 00:27:20.343
but went down to like 10 MeV.

00:27:20.343 --> 00:27:22.510
MICHAEL SHORT: I highly
doubt you were sitting there

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.165
during 10 MeV.

00:27:24.165 --> 00:27:25.915
AUDIENCE: I think the
highest we've gotten

00:27:25.915 --> 00:27:27.047
was probably 2 or 3.

00:27:27.047 --> 00:27:27.880
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:32.990
So 2 to 3 MeV, those proton
cross-sections jumped to 0.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.890
In fact, let me show
you that for a better--

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:41.020
kill the TRIM thing because
that'll fry the computer.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.610
Let's look at, I
don't know, carbon,

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:46.640
where there's a whole lot
more data, natural carbon.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.710
There should be lots of
nice cross-sections here.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.775
So in goes proton--

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:00.610
maybe not for natural.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:04.312
Carbon 12 has over 100
different reactions.

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.100
Something, n.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.170
Well, there's a lot of
reactions to sort through.

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:18.570
Well, I don't want to waste
your time with that now.

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:20.320
But anyway, hopefully
the cross-sections I

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:22.890
showed you show you
that around 5 MeV

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:24.580
or so you do start
to make neutrons.

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:26.640
So if you can get
up to 10 MeV, that's

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.473
why the vaults got that
forefoot thick door.

00:28:28.473 --> 00:28:30.598
You don't want to be in
the room when that happens.

00:28:30.598 --> 00:28:32.640
AUDIENCE: When we do a
lot of protons in class

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.558
is not shielded.

00:28:33.558 --> 00:28:34.350
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:37.540
But the class accelerator
only goes up to about 2 MeV.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.040
Yeah.

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:40.320
And that's perfectly safe to
be standing around there for.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.334
AUDIENCE: We have downstairs
we can't next week

00:28:42.334 --> 00:28:43.770
because interlock.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:44.650
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:46.840
Because of interlock, but not
because of physics, right?

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.790
AUDIENCE: I'm in both.

00:28:47.790 --> 00:28:49.600
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, fair enough.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.800
Cool.

00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.750
So now we're left with gammas.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.550
Gammas work pretty well.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:56.470
They have very,
very long ranges.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:58.050
Even the concept
of range of a gamma

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.370
is kind of a funny thing
to say because they undergo

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.260
exponential attenuation.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.760
So you want either a high
enough flux of gammas

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.960
that their low attenuation
won't matter or you

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.210
use a lower energy gamma ray.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.720
So cobalt 60 irradiators that
give off those 1 and 1/2 MeV

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.800
gammas are quite commonly
used for this sort of thing

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.690
because the 1 and 1/2
MeV gammas will get

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.393
through just about everything.

00:29:21.393 --> 00:29:22.810
You just need a
whole lot of them.

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:26.260
Has anyone here seen or heard
of the cobalt irradiator

00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.510
downstairs in the
basement building six?

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:30.220
We got one of these
things actually.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.063
It's just a sealed
source of cobalt.

00:29:32.063 --> 00:29:33.730
And the way you start
irradiation is you

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:37.000
simply open the door
and the irradiation

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.510
stops being shielded enough.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:44.890
Now, what things could go wrong
with super high energy gammas?

00:29:47.704 --> 00:29:49.423
AUDIENCE: Ironizations.

00:29:49.423 --> 00:29:51.590
MICHAEL SHORT: Ironizations
is what you want, right?

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:53.660
You want to ionize
the water and the DNA

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.690
of the bacteria or
the germinating cells

00:29:56.690 --> 00:29:58.670
so that they get destroyed.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:03.084
What else could you induce
with super high energy gammas?

00:30:03.084 --> 00:30:05.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] electrons.

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.815
MICHAEL SHORT: That's another
form of ionization, right?

00:30:07.815 --> 00:30:08.690
So that's a good one.

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.200
Why don't I show
you a quick thing?

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.780
Let's go to incident gamma data.

00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.100
I think the EXFOR database
will be pretty good.

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.300
Let's go back up to iron again.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.370
We'll go with our
red meat example.

00:30:32.410 --> 00:30:36.030
Gamma, neutron.

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.310
Anyone heard of gamma
induced neutron ejection?

00:30:41.250 --> 00:30:44.760
High enough energy
gamma rays will actually

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.580
cause neutrons to be emitted.

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:49.400
So gammas are a definite
yes from the point

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.170
of view of physics.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:54.610
They're also going to
have to be less than about

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:58.300
5 MeV because once you
get to around 5 MeV,

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.820
or in the case of
iron 56 10 MeV,

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:02.260
you end up with a non-zero.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:05.320
And actually fairly
significant like 0.1 barn

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:08.920
cross-section for a gamma
goes in, a neutron comes out,

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.260
and that neutron comes
out at whatever energy.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.000
It activates what's
nearby and makes

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.930
all sorts of nasty isotopes
that decay the way they will.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.510
Do you guys remember too
from the neutrons discussion

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:24.230
about photofission, the idea
that a gamma ray can induce

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.480
fission of a heavy nucleus?

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.940
So if there's any traces of
uranium in the food, which

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.110
there always are, whatever,
what you don't want it to do

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:34.660
is then make a whole
bunch of fission products

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.720
because even a couple parts
per million of uranium which

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.960
might be no big deal could
be a big deal if you turn it

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.610
into fission products
instead of plain old uranium

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.860
where it's just a heavy
metal, like lead, whatever.

00:31:47.860 --> 00:31:50.620
We can deal with a tiny
bit of lead in our food.

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:52.150
Totally.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.700
Yeah, OK.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.570
So while looking through
these internet studies

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:00.950
talking about--

00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:04.090
I don't like this kind
of argument number four,

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:06.340
irradiation encourages
filthy conditions.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.340
I don't think that's a
fault of the irradiation.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:10.798
I think that's a fault of the
people who are like, oh cool,

00:32:10.798 --> 00:32:13.450
physics means that we
can relax our standards.

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:15.180
These are separate arguments.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:19.200
And going through all these
things that, frankly either

00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.110
are false, are true,
but the question

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:26.810
is how much, and are true
to such a small degree

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.490
that it barely matters.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:33.640
And wading through a
lot of these things,

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.270
let's say, PhD thesis,
articles in the ecologist,

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:42.240
a lot of other FDA
papers, various filings,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.630
from the '60s came upon actually
a really useful document,

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:50.230
this World Health Organization
study on the wholesomeness

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.900
of food irradiated with
doses above 10 kilogray.

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:53.560
It's modern.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:56.125
It was done by a peer
reviewed study group.

00:32:56.125 --> 00:32:58.000
It was commissioned for
a major organization,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.120
so I pulled it up.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:00.620
Yeah.

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.750
It's like, OK, there's a
legit reference in here.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.490
I recommend you guys
look through this.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.620
It's quite fascinating
how many studies

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.680
have been done on rather
higher irradiation doses.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.710
So you can usually get away
with stopping germination

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:18.700
at around a kilogray or so,
rather low dose of radiation.

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.730
The highest dose anyone would
use is about 50 kilogray.

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.480
They specifically looked at the
highest order of magnitude dose

00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.510
that we use for food
irradiation and looked not just

00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:31.840
to say are there ill effects,
but what are the ill effects?

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.880
What are the other
compounds that are made,

00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.460
and do they matter in the end?

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.877
And I want to walk you guys
through a few of the bookmarks

00:33:37.877 --> 00:33:40.180
that I found pretty fascinating.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:43.990
I asked you guys about G-values
at low and high temperature.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:46.420
Here's a great plot
showing that right there.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:50.350
This is food irradiation done
at 20 and minus 40 Celsius

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:53.880
to look at the amount
of ammonia, nitrates,

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.930
ferrocyanides, things
that you might not

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:58.570
want, and look at the difference
between irradiating at 20

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:04.350
C and minus 40 C. Enormous.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:08.050
Why is that so, physically?

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:09.582
AUDIENCE: Diffusion stops.

00:34:09.582 --> 00:34:10.540
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:13.449
Diffusion stops when you
cease to have a liquid.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:16.389
It doesn't stop completely,
but the diffusion constant

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:18.100
of anything and a
solid it's going

00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:21.670
to be a whole lot slower than
that same anything in a liquid.

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:24.040
And so this way you
can destroy the cells

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.960
without all of the
radiolytic byproducts

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:28.929
going around and damaging other
food molecules and other food

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:30.960
cells.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:34.800
Then we got into the question
of off smells and funny sorts

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.670
of changes.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:40.449
So one of the comments said
can change the flavor odor

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:42.820
and texture of food,
pork can turn red,

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.580
beef can smell like a wet dog,
vegetables could become mushy,

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.010
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:49.870
This review of studies
actually looked

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:54.159
at what compounds are formed in
which foods, and by how much?

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:56.590
The only thing they didn't
tell you is how do they smell?

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.480
So I looked up a few of those.

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:01.990
They looked at hexanes as
a function of fat content

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:04.610
for a rather high
dose for 10 kilogray,

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:08.620
or at least here everything is
in normalized per 10 kilogray.

00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:12.370
So this is the yield of this
compound in nanograms per gram.

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:15.715
Does that sound like a big deal?

00:35:15.715 --> 00:35:17.090
It may not sound
like a big deal,

00:35:17.090 --> 00:35:19.670
but a lot of these
odiferous compounds

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.040
are detectable by the human
nose in parts per billion.

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.040
So they actually do matter.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.230
And I looked up to
see what sort of smell

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:29.720
do hexanes typically have?

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:35.960
The word was petrolic, smelling
like petrol or gasoline.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:38.060
Might not necessarily
be something you want.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:42.110
And it is true that fat
compounds when you break up

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:45.560
these, let's say, fat
molecules, which usually contain

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:48.080
three fatty acids,
those fatty acids

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:50.635
themselves are very aromatic.

00:35:50.635 --> 00:35:52.010
You've heard that
expression fats

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:54.100
where the flavor is, right?

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:57.940
A lot of it is not just due to,
well, if you just eat butter,

00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.800
it's not that flavorful.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.906
Anyone ever tried?

00:36:01.906 --> 00:36:03.640
I'm glad I'm not the only one.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.410
OK, good.

00:36:05.410 --> 00:36:08.420
But where fat really comes
into play is when you heat it

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:10.420
and it undergoes all sorts
of different chemical

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.820
reactions with the
food nearby, liberating

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:14.380
some of the fatty acids.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:17.890
It's part of why lamb smells
like lamb and nothing else,

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:22.990
is fat's where the flavor is,
and 90% of flavor is smell.

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.640
You've only got
five or six tastes

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.320
I think that's still
under the debate,

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.870
but you can smell thousands
of different compounds.

00:36:28.870 --> 00:36:30.142
And so they actually matter.

00:36:30.142 --> 00:36:32.100
So I started looking at
some of the other ones.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:38.510
Heptadecadiene in micrograms
per gram fat per 10

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:43.390
gray for foods containing
a lot of linoleic acid.

00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:48.720
The smell, Carrion
beetle sex pheromones.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.070
The sex pheromones shouldn't
be what turns you off,

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:52.458
it should be the Carrion beetle.

00:36:52.458 --> 00:36:53.125
What is Carrion?

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.780
It's the beetles that
feed on rotting meat.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.140
So this is the juice that
rotting meat beetles secrete

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:04.680
to attract other rotting
meat beetles nearby,

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:06.330
to use polite language.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.190
It's probably something that
you don't want in your food,

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.910
or is it?

00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:15.440
Does anybody know what
makes pork smell like pork?

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:15.940
Is what?

00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:17.213
AUDIENCE: Do I want to know?

00:37:17.213 --> 00:37:18.880
MICHAEL SHORT: You're
going to find out.

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.170
Who likes pork here?

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.670
Awesome.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:26.530
I'm going to ruin your day.

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:28.840
There's a compound
called skatole.

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:31.660
Can anyone figure out
from the root of the word?

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:33.550
Yeah.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:36.160
Anyone ever heard of that
wonderful barnyardy smell

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.280
from a cut of free range pork?

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.530
Anyone heard this term before?

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:42.447
Just raise your hands.

00:37:42.447 --> 00:37:45.230
Anyone heard the nice
pork barnyardy smell?

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.920
OK, a couple of people.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.530
That barnyardy smell is
parts per trillion or parts

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:51.420
per billion of skatole.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:56.190
So tiniest littlest bit of poop.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.520
Yeah.

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:00.110
The same sort of
compounds that you

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:04.130
find in scat in
incredibly small amounts

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:07.940
contribute to the wonderful
flavor of really good pork.

00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.620
So just because
these compounds are

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.000
made in higher amounts with
higher amounts of fat or dose

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.880
doesn't mean that they're
necessarily off flavors.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.250
But it is kind of
hilarious to see

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:20.900
what other places
do you tend to find

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.700
high concentrations of these?

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.810
The next one down,
hexadecatriene

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.100
from irradiation of muscle.

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.770
The one paper I could find
that talked about this

00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:33.350
in a cocktail of
smell compounds comes

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:38.180
from the odiferous
defensive stink glands

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:40.820
of red something beetles.

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.250
Yeah, sounds horrible, right?

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.320
So if you stopped
there you might think,

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.950
great, so radiation produces
odiferous defensive stink gland

00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:50.090
compounds.

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:52.550
But as we know,
pork smells great.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:55.760
We don't necessarily know
in what concentrations--

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.910
what is it?

00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:58.880
--hexadecatriene
would smell good

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.250
or smell bad to the human nose.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:01.430
It's just no telling.

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.890
There's some compounds in any
amount if you can detect them

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:05.090
they're terrible.

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:07.250
There's some compounds
that go from bad to good.

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:10.080
There's some pounds that
go from good to bad.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.540
Anyone ever smell someone that's
slopped on perfume before?

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:17.330
Would you describe
the smell as good?

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:18.670
No.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.370
Perfume relies on lots of
different compounds in very,

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:23.650
very small concentrations.

00:39:23.650 --> 00:39:25.930
It's supposed to be subtle
and enhance your own body

00:39:25.930 --> 00:39:26.800
chemistry.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.990
You're not supposed to
smell like a perfume factory

00:39:28.990 --> 00:39:30.310
explosion.

00:39:30.310 --> 00:39:32.500
So another sort of
real life analogy

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:34.870
where too much of a
good smelling thing can

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:36.770
smell really bad.

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:37.700
Yeah.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:41.600
And so then going on from
the various odiferous

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.547
compounds where a few other
points I wanted to-- oh no,

00:39:44.547 --> 00:39:45.380
there's another one.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:46.362
OK.

00:39:46.362 --> 00:39:48.320
Seems like the production
is pretty much linear

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.620
with either dose or with the
abundance of the precursor

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.030
normalized dose.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:55.160
This one you tend to
find in deodorants.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:57.720
What was the name
of this compound?

00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.653
Propanediol type.

00:39:59.653 --> 00:40:01.320
Don't know the structure
because I'm not

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.350
an organic chemist, but things
you might find in deodorant.

00:40:04.350 --> 00:40:05.940
Again, no telling
whether or not this

00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:08.070
would be good or bad
in food and how much.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:10.840
That's always the question
I want you to remember.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.670
If somebody asks, isn't
binary effect bad?

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:16.740
Isn't meta tag
binary effect bad?

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.330
The question is
depends how much.

00:40:19.330 --> 00:40:19.830
Yeah?

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:22.150
AUDIENCE: Do these like
graphs show how much more more

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:24.795
there was afterwards or
just like how much there

00:40:24.795 --> 00:40:25.622
is in general?

00:40:25.622 --> 00:40:26.580
MICHAEL SHORT: They do.

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:30.770
It shows the dose normalized
yield per 10 kilogray

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.710
in micrograms per gram.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:34.890
So it shows that depending
on how much of whatever

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:38.160
precursor, in this case
enzyme inactivated muscle

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:41.160
there was, how much relative
amount of this compound

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.042
existed.

00:40:42.042 --> 00:40:43.500
What these graphs
are telling us is

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.540
they're pretty much
all linear and they're

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:46.950
pretty much all the same for--

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.830
I saw that as human for
a second, holy crap.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:50.550
My heart just skipped a beat.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:54.150
--ham beef, chicken, pork.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.370
Oh man.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:41:00.720
Anyway, going into
the conclusions, which

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.330
again are strikingly different
than the internet article would

00:41:03.330 --> 00:41:07.470
have you believe, I wanted
to point things out.

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:07.980
Interesting.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.060
Irradiating moist foods while
frozen in the absence of oxygen

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:16.312
significantly decreases overall
chemical yields by about 80%

00:41:16.312 --> 00:41:18.270
So it's interesting you
can irradiate something

00:41:18.270 --> 00:41:22.050
to 50 kilogray at minus 30 C
and it does the same chemical

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:25.200
change as 10 kilogray at
room or chilled temperatures,

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.670
but you do that much more
damage to the organisms.

00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:34.920
So yeah, there you go, better to
irradiate at cold temperatures.

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:39.750
And there's a few other
interesting conclusions.

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:44.100
These radiolytic compounds, are
they found in food otherwise?

00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:45.990
Virtually all the
radiolytic products

00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:49.080
found in high dose irradiated
foods are either naturally

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.070
present foods or produced in
thermally processed foods.

00:41:53.070 --> 00:41:56.190
Before food irradiation
you had heat sterilization.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.320
In fact we still
do for quite a bit.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.820
And folks, a lot
of times we'll talk

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:03.540
about the amount of nutritional
decline, the amount of lack

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:05.700
of nutrition from
irradiated foods,

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:08.260
and they'll just say
it's a bad thing.

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:10.450
That's not the right
fact to see here.

00:42:10.450 --> 00:42:15.450
Food preservation tends to
lower the nutritional content.

00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:20.150
And there's a few neat tables
I want you guys to look at.

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:21.890
In terms of
macronutrients, do you

00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:25.280
lose the protein, the
fat, the carbohydrates

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.420
from in this case,
gamma-irradiated mackerel,

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.090
as a function of dose?

00:42:29.090 --> 00:42:30.500
Does anybody see a trend here?

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.090
Take a sec to look
at the numbers.

00:42:40.495 --> 00:42:44.317
AUDIENCE: Seems like
it bumps in the middle.

00:42:44.317 --> 00:42:46.650
MICHAEL SHORT: It does seem
like the nutritional content

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:50.070
goes a little bit up with
small doses, doesn't it?

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:54.858
Would you necessarily believe
these data at first glance

00:42:54.858 --> 00:42:58.205
or at face value?

00:42:58.205 --> 00:42:59.580
What's missing
from this data set

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.720
for you to draw a statistically
significant conclusion?

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.040
AUDIENCE: Error bars.

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.020
MICHAEL SHORT:
Error bars, right.

00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.030
If this is the
graph of, let's say,

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:13.620
protein content versus dose
in gray and this is protein,

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.740
the data appear to do
something like this.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.480
If the error bars
are like that then

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.530
you can't draw any
meaningful conclusions.

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.843
So one would have to
go back to the study

00:43:25.843 --> 00:43:27.510
to see hopefully they
actually had error

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.130
bars in their measurements.

00:43:29.130 --> 00:43:31.020
So what I can
conclude from this is

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.433
macronutrients
basically don't change

00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:35.100
with up to the highest
dose of radiation

00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.930
that we give to any food at all.

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:38.970
What about the micronutrients?

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:41.730
What about things like vitamins?

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:46.060
They do go down somewhat,
and they're pretty linear.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.430
They're fairly linear with dose.

00:43:47.430 --> 00:43:49.720
It's not much to
be disputed there,

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:53.160
is yes, irradiating
food does destroy

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.310
some of the vitamins
and not the minerals.

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:59.340
Why wouldn't gamma irradiation
destroy minerals in food?

00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:05.900
What's an example of a mineral
that you need for survival?

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:06.770
AUDIENCE: Iron.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:07.603
MICHAEL SHORT: Iron.

00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:08.530
AUDIENCE: Calcium.

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:11.180
MICHAEL SHORT: Calcium.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.520
Yeah, bunch of other elements
or inorganic compounds.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:17.310
Why does food irradiation
not affect mineral content?

00:44:25.118 --> 00:44:28.700
AUDIENCE: If you use low enough
energy gammas it's just not

00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.383
going to change paratonic.

00:44:30.383 --> 00:44:31.550
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:44:31.550 --> 00:44:31.670
Yeah.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:34.040
You stay below 5 MeV gammas
and there's literally

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.850
no change in the elemental
composition of those minerals.

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.040
The vitamins, however,
tend to be more complex

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:42.830
organic compounds
that can be damaged.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:45.290
And one of those big
ones is thiamine, better

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:46.810
known as vitamin B1.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:49.350
So irradiated food is a
little bit less nutritious,

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:54.460
but they give a pretty
good explanation.

00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:56.258
Let's see.

00:44:56.258 --> 00:44:57.800
Think that's later
in the conclusion,

00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:59.790
so we'll get to that.

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:01.170
Conclusions on nutrition.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:01.920
Yeah, there we go.

00:45:05.110 --> 00:45:07.830
So in this case, what
they're saying is, well yeah,

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.010
it takes away some thiamine,
but irradiated food

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:14.260
does not constitute the major
source of thiamine in the diet.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.670
So even though it does
reduce the amount of thiamine

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:19.380
that you get, it
doesn't make a dent

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:21.490
in your overall
nutritional uptake

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.690
unless you eat nothing
but that irradiated food.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:27.660
Does anyone remember when the
last case of scurvy in the US

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:29.140
happened?

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.680
Talking about single food diets.

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.090
Happened right here at MIT.

00:45:34.090 --> 00:45:35.020
It was a while ago.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.830
I think by now it would have
been over 10 or 15 years ago.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:40.330
There was a student
that decided I'm

00:45:40.330 --> 00:45:42.663
going to have the cheapest
food budget ever and live off

00:45:42.663 --> 00:45:44.785
nothing but instant
packs of ramen.

00:45:44.785 --> 00:45:46.660
Now, this is already a
nutritional nightmare,

00:45:46.660 --> 00:45:47.785
but it got worse and worse.

00:45:47.785 --> 00:45:50.500
So it was the ramen, the
flavor packs and water,

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:52.778
and that's just what this
person ate the whole time.

00:45:52.778 --> 00:45:54.320
And then they decided,
you know what?

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:55.390
I don't really need
the flavor pack

00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:57.432
because that's just a
bunch of sodium, taking out

00:45:57.432 --> 00:46:00.370
whatever little
micronutrients were left.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:03.880
And then the next logical step
was why bother cooking it?

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.420
And a few weeks later massive
constipation and scurvy ensued,

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.220
which is a disease
you don't see anymore,

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:11.025
from a deficiency
of vitamin C. So

00:46:11.025 --> 00:46:13.150
if you're only eating one
food to begin with you've

00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:17.300
got other problems have nothing
to do with food irradiation.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:17.800
Yeah?

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:20.342
AUDIENCE: I'm not even surprised
that the last case of scurvy

00:46:20.342 --> 00:46:21.810
was an MIT student.

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:24.870
MICHAEL SHORT: I'm not
surprised at all either.

00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:26.688
I'm surprised Soylent
wasn't invented here.

00:46:26.688 --> 00:46:28.730
It seems like the kind of
thing that someone here

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:29.397
would have done.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.320
Anyway, let's take a look.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.780
Ah, irradiation versus
heat sterilization.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:39.420
From a nutritional
viewpoint, irradiated foods

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:43.680
are equivalent or superior to
thermally sterilized foods.

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:46.155
Why do you guys
think that might be?

00:46:46.155 --> 00:46:47.780
AUDIENCE: They're
really sterilizing it

00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:50.203
with denaturing most
of the proteins.

00:46:50.203 --> 00:46:51.120
MICHAEL SHORT: Indeed.

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.190
So you'd actually get
some macronutrients

00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:56.430
to disappear if you start to
denature or break down those,

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.410
and even for micronutrients.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:02.790
The idea here is that the
amount of micronutrient content

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:05.610
will go down roughly
linearly with dose.

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:08.550
What happens when you reach the
temperature of destabilization

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.330
of those foods?

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:11.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
dropped them.

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.620
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
all of it goes away.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.530
Once it's temperature
unstable, if you keep it

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.360
at that temperature
for long enough

00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.680
you'll destroy pretty much
all the nutritional content.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.240
So if the choice is between do
you heat or do you irradiate,

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.520
irradiating does less
damage in the end.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:35.250
Anyone here ever had an
MRE, a Meal Ready to Eat?

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:38.128
How do they taste?

00:47:38.128 --> 00:47:41.490
AUDIENCE: They're not great,
but they're not awful.

00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:44.970
MICHAEL SHORT: But they
do last for like decades,

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.020
like many decades.

00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:48.120
There's an entire
channel on YouTube

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.820
of this guy that just eats MREs
from further and further back.

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:54.480
I think he's made it as
far back as the Civil War

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.660
and ate actual moldy hard
tack from the Civil War.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.120
But my point here is
that all the way back

00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.480
to definitely to World War II
and perhaps beforehand, MREs

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.970
were sterilized with heat.

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:09.450
You put something in a metal and
plastic lined bag to keep out

00:48:09.450 --> 00:48:10.842
all other organisms.

00:48:10.842 --> 00:48:12.300
You heat it for
long enough to kill

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:16.260
every single other organism
and they last for decades.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:19.530
And the question is, do you
want to eat what's in the bag?

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.230
If you want some fun
between studying for finals

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:25.020
listen to this guy's reaction
as he eats some of these 60

00:48:25.020 --> 00:48:28.170
or 70-year-old MREs from World
War II of the Korean War.

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.600
AUDIENCE: Why would they
subject themselves to this?

00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:32.830
MICHAEL SHORT: I don't
know, for attention.

00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:35.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] gets stung
by a really painful insect,

00:48:35.590 --> 00:48:36.567
and I will say why?

00:48:36.567 --> 00:48:37.400
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:42.950
At any rate, canned
food you can tell

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.003
has an awfully
different taste to it.

00:48:45.003 --> 00:48:46.670
A lot of these cans
are heat sterilized.

00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:48.495
They're pasteurized
and the heat themselves

00:48:48.495 --> 00:48:50.120
generates a lot of
off flavors that you

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.480
can tell the difference between
fresh and canned green beans

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.540
in taste, texture, color,
mushiness, whatever other

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.580
qualifiers you give to food.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.880
So to those opponents
of food irradiation,

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.740
I'd say consider
the alternatives,

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:06.110
either heat
sterilization or spending

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.662
most of your waking
hours in the bathroom.

00:49:08.662 --> 00:49:12.920
AUDIENCE: How do you like
thermally sterilize meat

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.760
without cooking it?

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.760
I've always been really
confused about that.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:20.390
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah,
you can't necessarily.

00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:22.460
There are also spores
of bacteria that

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:23.930
are incredibly heat tolerant.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:26.358
So you can't necessarily
sterilize meat

00:49:26.358 --> 00:49:27.150
without cooking it.

00:49:27.150 --> 00:49:31.130
So the best thing to do is
to cook it, sealed in a can,

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:33.560
or sealed in something
and then don't unseal it

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:37.190
until consumption time.

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.740
Yeah.

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:40.710
There are other things that you
can sterilize without cooking

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:41.460
them, like milk.

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:42.702
Milk is pasteurized.

00:49:42.702 --> 00:49:44.160
You heat it to a
temperature that's

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:47.220
sufficient to kill most
of the microorganisms

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:50.700
not to sterilize it, but
to increase its shelf life

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:55.530
so that it takes months instead
of hours for that microorganism

00:49:55.530 --> 00:49:58.908
population to bloom
and ruin the milk.

00:49:58.908 --> 00:50:01.200
I'm sure everyone here has
smelled spoiled milk before,

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:01.770
right?

00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.312
Doesn't matter how
pasteurized it is.

00:50:03.312 --> 00:50:06.270
Has anyone opened a carton of
expired milk after its shelf

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:07.090
life?

00:50:07.090 --> 00:50:09.900
AUDIENCE: One time I
poured it into my cereal.

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.310
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:13.920
That was a study in
two phase flow, right?

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.050
Liquid, solid.

00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:17.010
Yeah.

00:50:17.010 --> 00:50:18.360
Yep.

00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.840
So there is some proof right
there, a few bacteria survive.

00:50:20.840 --> 00:50:22.590
It's the same thing
with food irradiation,

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:24.630
you need an enormous
dose in order

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:26.590
to actually sterilize the food.

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.100
So this is usually the
only option for folks

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:32.050
with extremely compromised
immune systems in hospitals

00:50:32.050 --> 00:50:34.800
is if you want to give
them actually sterile food

00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.245
that's actually
palatable, you irradiate

00:50:37.245 --> 00:50:39.260
it to like 50 kilogray.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:42.780
And that kills just about
every single organism including

00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:45.300
the long lived spores.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:47.220
One other side benefit
of food irradiation

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:51.270
is the cells that survive have
been blasted by radiation.

00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:55.260
They tend to be a lot weaker and
more sensitive to heat and pH

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:58.508
and temperature-- heat,
temperature, the same thing.

00:50:58.508 --> 00:51:01.050
--so that the cells that make
it through the food irradiation

00:51:01.050 --> 00:51:03.240
are more susceptible
to damage and then

00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.126
it helps make things
a little bit safer.

00:51:06.126 --> 00:51:09.540
I'm trying to see if there's
any other conclusions.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.250
Oh yeah, the old who
cares about thiamine.

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.820
It's unlikely however, that the
irradiated foods of this type

00:51:14.820 --> 00:51:17.220
would constitute a large
enough proportion of the diet

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:20.070
to compromise the dietary
requirement for thiamine.

00:51:20.070 --> 00:51:22.320
And this is coming from the
World Health Organization.

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.862
If there's any
organization you think

00:51:23.862 --> 00:51:26.880
you can trust about health
everywhere, it's the WHO,

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.200
it's these guys.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.510
And I don't think we have time
for more of the conclusions,

00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:37.030
however I will post this
document up to the learning

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:38.590
module site so you
guys can peruse

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:40.900
at your leisure along
with the bookmarks,

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:42.917
unless I've done it already.

00:51:42.917 --> 00:51:45.250
Want to open it up the last
two minutes to any questions

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:47.320
you guys may have about
anything, including

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.080
final logistics, how it's
going to all come down,

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:53.105
the review session on Friday,
whatever you guys want.

00:51:53.105 --> 00:51:55.230
AUDIENCE: So the review is
9:00 to 10:00 on Friday?

00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:55.720
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:57.310
The review is 9:00
to 10:00 or 10:30,

00:51:57.310 --> 00:51:58.870
whenever we finish on Friday.

00:51:58.870 --> 00:52:00.760
I'll email out with a
room once I secure one.

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:04.130
Yeah?

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.306
AUDIENCE: Where do they
usually do food irradiation?

00:52:07.306 --> 00:52:09.858
MICHAEL SHORT: There are
gamma irradiation facilities

00:52:09.858 --> 00:52:12.025
where they've got these
cobalt 60 or cesium sources.

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.340
No, this would be
processing centers.

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:21.670
Yeah, I mean you
can't normally own

00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:23.530
one of these giant
cobalt sources so.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:25.540
These would be specialized
processing centers.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:25.900
Yeah?

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:27.275
AUDIENCE: So is
this usually only

00:52:27.275 --> 00:52:30.785
done for foods coming
in the US from outside?

00:52:30.785 --> 00:52:31.660
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh no.

00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:34.202
It can be done for foods grown
within and for the consumption

00:52:34.202 --> 00:52:35.320
in the US too.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.290
If you want to extend its shelf
life by small or large amounts

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:40.240
you can do it for
anything, but there

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.310
are a number of different
types of produce

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:45.755
that can only be imported
because of food irradiation.

00:52:45.755 --> 00:52:47.380
One of these that I
was delighted about

00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.430
was mangosteens from Thailand.

00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:52.950
Mangosteens probably
almost no one here

00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:54.300
has ever even heard of or seen.

00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.420
I'm surprised anyone has.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:52:59.400
OK, wow, two, that's a record.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:01.860
They're usually only found
in South or Southeast Asia.

00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.810
They don't tend
to last very long

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:05.850
and they tend to be
riddled with parasites.

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:08.310
But one time out of two that
I've opened up a mangosteen,

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:10.350
a whole bunch of bugs
started crawling out.

00:53:10.350 --> 00:53:12.270
You'd imagine that
the US doesn't

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:14.710
want that imported into here.

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:18.130
But in 2005 Thailand started
irradiating their mangosteens.

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:20.380
They were approved for
sale in this country

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:23.520
and you can find them at H
Mart now down the street.

00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:27.420
Even food from Hawaii has to
be irradiated for consumption

00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:29.780
in the continental US.

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.680
Why do you guys think that is?

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:34.338
AUDIENCE: Human species.

00:53:34.338 --> 00:53:35.880
MICHAEL SHORT:
According to the USDA,

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:39.150
Hawaii is effectively
a different country

00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:40.860
when it comes to the
sorts of parasites

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.480
you'd find in the food.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.820
It is a part of the US, but
it is not agriculturally

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.680
a part of the continental US.

00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.930
It's got its own unique
parasites and pathogens

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:50.910
and organisms and critters.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:52.590
So a lot of things
coming from Hawaii

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.630
have to be irradiated
for consumption

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:57.530
in the continental US.

00:53:57.530 --> 00:54:00.810
So yeah, food irradiation
helps food commerce go around.

00:54:00.810 --> 00:54:02.150
Any other questions?

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:06.242
Yeah?

00:54:06.242 --> 00:54:07.310
No, it's you.

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:09.835
AUDIENCE: What percentage of
food actually gets irradiated?

00:54:09.835 --> 00:54:11.960
MICHAEL SHORT: I don't know
what percentage of food

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.990
gets irradiated.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.600
It especially
depend on the type.

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.280
There's some things
that don't need it.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.795
There's some things
that do need it.

00:54:18.795 --> 00:54:21.170
I'd wager a guess to say that
more imports get irradiated

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:25.690
than domestic consumption stuff,
but I don't know that for sure.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.950
DAN FREY: Hello, I'm Dan Frey.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.500
And I'm the faculty research
director at MIT's D lab.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.920
I'm also principal investigator
for the Comprehensive

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.980
Initiative on Technology
Evaluation, which we

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.060
refer to by the acronym CITE.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.460
The CITE program was
established in order

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.240
to assess and evaluate
technologies and products

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.920
so that we can better understand
which ones perform the best

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.270
and also which ones provide the
best value given the context.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.750
And better information about
process and technologies

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.310
also helps us to best
implement those technologies

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.980
in an international
development setting.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.240
Now, this topic is especially
important in machine learning.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.450
We understand that these
exciting new technologies

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.300
can sometimes cause or else
propagate certain inequities

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.890
or biases.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.050
And there are a
number of techniques

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.720
that are now emerging from
research community that

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.800
can help us to mitigate
those problems by adjusting

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.580
the algorithms or
else modifying data

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.200
sets in order to provide better,
more equitable, and more fair

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.730
outcomes.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.120
Now, we hope that you'll
engage with us very deeply

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.550
in this course and that we'll be
able to provide knowledge that

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.120
can help you to better
implement these techniques

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.580
in your own
professional endeavors.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.820
Thanks for joining
us in this course.

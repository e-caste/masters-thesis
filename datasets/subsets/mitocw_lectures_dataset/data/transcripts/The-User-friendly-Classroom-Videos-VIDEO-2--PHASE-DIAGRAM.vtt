00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.172
SHAWN: OK.

00:00:12.172 --> 00:00:13.130
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.896
Welcome to the recitation
section of 10.213.

00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:18.848
This is the agenda for today.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.660
So first of all, we
will review the concept

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.600
of the physical
state of a substance.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.820
And secondly, we're going to
talk about phase diagramming.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.050
First of all, the
physical state is a state

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.870
that a molecule can
exist in reality.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.380
So take water as an example.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.994
Water can exist as
gas, liquid, and--

00:00:59.994 --> 00:01:00.660
STUDENTS: Solid.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.320
SHAWN: Solid.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.100
Correct.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.135
So a phase diagram is a tool
for engineers or scientists

00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:10.910
to interpret or very easily
identify the physical state

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.436
at a certain temperature
and pressure.

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:17.170
So we have this diagram.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.832
And on the horizontal
axis is temperature,

00:01:24.832 --> 00:01:27.826
with a unit of Celsius.

00:01:27.826 --> 00:01:34.830
And on the vertical
axis, we have pressure,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.371
with a unit of pascals.

00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:38.682
OK?

00:01:38.682 --> 00:01:42.620
As we just talked about, we have
three different states of water

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.270
exist in this diagram.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.010
At high temperature-- this is
the high-temperature phase--

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.104
low pressure, water
will exist as--

00:01:52.104 --> 00:01:53.020
STUDENTS: Gas.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.395
SHAWN: Correct.

00:01:54.395 --> 00:01:56.110
So this is the gas state.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.624
And at low temperature, high
pressure, what do we exist as?

00:02:01.624 --> 00:02:02.290
STUDENTS: Solid.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.170
SHAWN: Solid?

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.610
Great.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.210
And at moderate
temperature and pressure,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.285
water will exist as liquid.

00:02:13.285 --> 00:02:16.260
That's what we usually
see in reality.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.218
And there are a lot of--
there are some-- sorry.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.790
Some of the components
in this phase

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.110
diagram you have to identify
the physical state of the matter

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.170
and also when they transform
from one state to another.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.470
So we have three
different lines here.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.150
So each line represents
a certain condition

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.430
that two phases can coexist.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:12.420
So for example, at 100 Celsius
and 101.325 kilopascals-- so

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.170
at this specific
pressure and temperature,

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.435
water can exist as gas
and liquid simultaneously.

00:03:19.435 --> 00:03:21.552
So far, so clear?

00:03:21.552 --> 00:03:23.520
OK.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.670
And there's an intersecting
point of these three lines.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.488
This intersecting point
is called a triple point.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.100
At this triple point, we
have three phases coexist.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.127
So solid, liquid, and gas can
exist at this specific pressure

00:03:48.127 --> 00:03:49.121
and temperature.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.630
OK.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.810
So now there's a question.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.334
Supposedly you're on
the mountain of Himalaya

00:03:57.334 --> 00:03:59.870
and then you know
the pressure is

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.762
slightly lower than
1 atmosphere, which

00:04:02.762 --> 00:04:06.130
is less than 1.1 kilopascal.

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.390
My question is, is the water
going to boil at 100 Celsius?

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.528
Or is it going to boil
below or above 100 Celsius?

00:04:16.528 --> 00:04:21.488
Anyone that volunteer a guess?

00:04:21.488 --> 00:04:22.302
Melissa?

00:04:22.302 --> 00:04:23.968
STUDENTS: It would
be below 100 Celsius.

00:04:23.968 --> 00:04:24.464
SHAWN: OK.

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:24.960
Why?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960
STUDENTS: Because if
you're at a lower pressure,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.672
you'll intersect the coexistence
line between liquid and gas

00:04:29.672 --> 00:04:30.783
at a lower temperature.

00:04:30.783 --> 00:04:31.408
SHAWN: Correct.

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:31.908
Excellent.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.729
Does anyone follow her?

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:37.228
OK.

00:04:37.228 --> 00:04:39.450
Great.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.540
So let me just wrap
up today's lesson.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.130
We first reviewed the
physical state of water.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.780
Water can exist as
liquid, solid, and gas

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.400
depending on the
temperature and pressure.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.397
And then we drew the
phase diagram of water.

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:55.272
And there are three
different elements there,

00:04:55.272 --> 00:04:56.620
which you'll remember.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.450
First, in each space, you
have the phase of water.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:06.570
And then we have the coexisting
lines, which is the lines

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.300
that water can exist
as two different phases

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.224
simultaneously.

00:05:11.224 --> 00:05:13.440
And then we have
the triple point,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.035
where three different
phases can coexist.

00:05:16.035 --> 00:05:17.480
OK.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.760
Any questions for today?

00:05:24.084 --> 00:05:26.020
OK.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.330
So this is for today.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.720
Next time, we will talk about
phase diagrams of a mixture.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.350
For example, if you add sodium
chloride, which is salt,

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.340
in water, how does the phase
diagram of water change?

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.170
If you want to know
that, definitely

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.740
come to our next
recitation section.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.470
Thank you.

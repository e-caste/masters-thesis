00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:26.160
PROFESSOR: OK, so kinetics we're
continuing with today.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.200
We talked on Wednesday about
first order kinetics and we'll

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.080
do a brief review
of some of that.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.650
And we're going to talk about
second order kinetics.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.210
Today we're going to come back
up and talk about chemical

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.540
equilibrium, which is something
I love to do to

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.080
review things that we've
talked about before.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.260
And we're going to start in on
reaction mechanisms. So, I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.780
thought I would mention, some of
you have may have seen the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.520
activity in the Infinite
Corridor, but today is world

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.210
AIDS day, and today a lot of the
compounds that are being

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.360
used to treat HIV were actually
designed based on

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.850
making inhibitors to enzymes.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.410
And so, to design those
pharmaceuticals, people had to

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.570
understand the reaction
mechanism of the enzyme, and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.240
enzymes, of course, are
catalysts in the body.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.510
So, knowledge of what medical
individuals needed to know to

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.230
design these inhibitors to treat
HIV are actually a lot

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.570
from this unit that we're going
to be talking about.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.740
So, we'll be talking about
reaction mechanisms, and we're

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.600
also going to be talking about
enzyme catalysis, which were

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.910
key points in being able to
come up with some of the

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.390
current treatments
against HIV.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.330
All right, so just a little
review from last Wednesday.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.280
We talked about first
order half life.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.810
We talked about first order
kinetics, we came up with an

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.510
integrated first order
rate law, and we also

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.380
talked about half life.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.200
And you told me last time that
an example of first order half

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.450
life is radioactivity, which
we're going to be talking

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.520
about today.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.700
So, just a little review from
last time, you have your first

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.160
order integrated rate law, and
the half life is defined as

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.400
the time it takes for half of
the original material to go

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.540
away, and half life is
abbreviated t 1/2, that's the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.030
symbol for half life, so the
time for half of the original

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.360
material to go away.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.080
If you plug original material
divided by 2 in there, then

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.500
the original material a to the
o for original, drops out and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.100
you come up with this equation
of the natural log of 1/2

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.770
equals minus k t 1/2,
and k is, of

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.370
course, our rate constant.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.610
And so, then we can take the
natural log of a 1/2 and we

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:53.580
get a value.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.700
Rearranging that, you get
half life equals 0 .

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.710
6 9 3 1 over k.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.010
And so you told me last time for
this plot for first order

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.060
half life, each half life,
half of the original

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.260
material goes away.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.520
So, one example of a first order
half life process is

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.630
radioactive decay.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.100
And the reason why this is a
first order process is because

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.530
the decay of the nucleus is
independent of the number of

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.640
surrounding nuclei that
has been decayed.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.650
So it's independent of
the original starting

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.850
concentration, and since it's
independent, notice that's a

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.630
blank in your notes, since it's
independent, then that

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.740
makes it a first
order process.

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.380
So, we can apply first order
integrated rate laws to

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.120
radioactive decay.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.500
So here were some of the
equations we had last time.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.090
We had, this is a different
expression of the first order

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.930
rate law where the material,
concentration material of

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.540
material a, at some particular
time equals the original

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.890
concentration, e to the minus k
t, where you have your rate

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.670
constant and the time that has
elapsed, and we also just

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.690
talked about first order half
lifes with this equation here.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.200
So, we can use those same
equations, but often you don't

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.280
see it in terms of concentration
of a, you

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.660
usually see these expressions in
terms of either the number

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.610
of nuclei or a different a,
which is a for activity.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.710
So instead of concentration,
we're talking about the number

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:47.010
of nuclei that have decay
or capital N.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.460
So, we can write this same
expression, but now using N

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.820
instead of concentration of a,
same thing, number of nuclei

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.870
equal the original number of
nuclei, e, to the minus k t,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.220
where k is our rate constant,
or in this case decay

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:09.430
constant, and t is time.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.620
So, with chemical kinetics,
we're usually talking about

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.190
the change in concentration of
things over time, but with

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.660
nuclear kinetics, we're talking
about the number of

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.790
decay events, the number of
nuclei that have decayed.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.370
And so, here with nuclear
kinetics, we measure these

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.410
events using a Geiger counter.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.390
So this can measure radiation,
and I'm going to come around

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:37.360
and just check the room.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.510
And so, the gasket's ionized
and then you

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.630
hear different clicks.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.030
See if you can hear the clicks
as I come around.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:59.580
So let's just see if we have
any problems over here.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:07.590
Oh, maybe a little bit.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.800
No, this is fine.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.190
There's always a little bit of
radioactivity, it's all fine.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:25.260
So, this is a Geiger counter,
which will measure nuclear

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.460
kinetics, it will measure
radioactivity.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.230
And my lab has this particular
one, because we use x-rays in

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.640
our experiments.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.330
OK, we'll leave this on low
just to check things

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.620
out as we go along.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.390
All right, so we do have
a term, A, that we talk

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:50.480
about in this unit.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.900
Instead of concentration
of A, it's activity.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:00.330
And so, activity here, sort of
the decay rate, is also called

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.290
activity, capital A, and so this
is equal to the change in

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.740
the number of nuclei or our
decay constant times the

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.510
number of nuclei.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.520
And people will often talk
about the activity of

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:18.290
particular radioactive
compounds.

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.640
So, because activity is
proportional to the number of

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.010
nuclei, you can also take this
expression and write it as

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.160
this expression.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.580
So you can have either the
number of nuclei equal the

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.500
original number of nuclei, e to
the k t, or you can do it

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.150
in terms of activity -- that the
activity at some time is

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.330
equal to the original activity,
e to the minus k t.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:51.580
So, all of these equations can
be re-written in this way.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:08:03.170
So, let's talk a minute
about units.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:08.480
All right, so the activity for
units, the new activity is Bq,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.750
Becquerel. and that,
actually is named

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.010
after a French person.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:17.260
Henry was his first name,
and my French

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:19.360
pronunciation is not very good.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.940
This is the current unit.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.930
It's equal to one radioactive
disintegration per second.

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:28.080
The older unit, which you may
be familiar with, is called

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.980
the Curie, and that is 3 .

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.090
7 times 10 to the 10
disintegrations per second.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.940
Does anyone want to guess,
the Curie unit, who

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:40.110
that was named after?

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:44.930
STUDENT: Marie Curie?

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.220
PROFESSOR: No, it was named
after her husband actually,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.200
Pierre Curie.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.530
And I actually always assume,
because Marie is actually more

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.800
famous than her husband.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.860
But she, Marie Curie won two
Nobel prizes, so we shouldn't

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.390
feel too sorry for her.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:08.540
Her husband shared the first
Nobel Prize with her in, I

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:13.300
think it was 1903, but then in
1906 he was killed in a road

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.020
accident, run over by something
that was crossing

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.440
the street.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.570
So he did not share the second
Nobel Prize, because by the

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:26.630
time that came around about
1911, he had passed away.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:30.240
So, at first, we had the Curie,
but then that turned

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.400
out to be a really big number.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.610
And so, when you were talking
about sort of safe units for

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:40.240
workers to be exposed to, if
they were being exposed to

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:44.790
things 10 to the 10, that really
isn't very healthy.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.350
So they wanted to have sort
of a much smaller unit.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.840
And so I guess that Marie Curie
at that point talked

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:58.790
about how her husband would feel
about having the Curie

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:02.050
not being the standard unit,
but I guess she was OK with

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.470
it, because if we had kept that
same unit, then people

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.500
would have been using it and it
would of had to of been a

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:13.320
really, really small number,
because it was sort of picked

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.820
to be set up to something that
was too large, and she didn't

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.410
want her husband's name
apparently associated with a

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:22.360
sort of an infinitesimally small
quantity of something.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.550
So, the Curie was sort
of done away with.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.250
And Henry Becquerel, who was
one of the people who

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.940
discovered radioactivity and
shared that first Nobel Prize,

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.690
had the unit named after him.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.890
And I always ask the freshman
chemistry class that as they

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:43.710
go through MIT, if they ever
discover a unit that is named

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.120
after a female scientist,
to please come

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.860
back and let me know.

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.100
This was the one I thought
was named after a female

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.560
scientist, but as it
turns out, it was

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.670
actually Pierre Curie.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:57.200
So, if you hear of any,
please let me

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.420
know for future reference.

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.780
So, the current unit you'll
be using is Bq here for

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:09.000
radioactivity.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.170
So, you're not responsible for
knowing all the different

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.340
types of radioactivity.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.020
When you're working problems,
you can always get this

00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.110
information.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.840
I'll just mention that a number
of different kinds of

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.890
radioactivity, some involve
a mass change, some do not

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.400
involve a mass change.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.290
So, alpha decay, this isn't
actually in your notes,

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.100
there's a reference to
where the table is.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.530
You're not responsible for
memorizing it, so I didn't put

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:33.800
it in the notes.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.990
An alpha decay is equivalent to
a helium 4 nucleus, so you

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:41.080
lose two protons,
two neutrons, so

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.650
that's a big mass change.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.490
Whereas say a beta decay
involves a loss of electrons,

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.440
so there's no mass change
associated with that.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:52.590
So just to be aware that there
are these differences in

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:57.040
different types of radiation.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.760
There's also really big
differences in terms of half

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.460
lives of radioactive isotopes,
and again, this information

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.620
would be given to you on a test
or a problem-set, so you

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.930
don't have to memorize it.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:13.620
So, this table is similar to
one in your book, and the

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.180
point here is just how different
half lifes can be.

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:23.670
So the abbreviation a here
is year, d is day.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:28.760
So you see some of these half
lifes are in multiple years,

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.810
some of them are days, so there
are big differences in

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:36.000
terms of the half life of some
of these radioactive isotopes.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.660
Some of them stay around
for a really, really,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.700
really, really long time.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.310
So, I thought I would share
with you a poem about half

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.290
lifes today.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.400
And this was written by a former
graduate student at

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:55.790
MIT, Mala Radhakrishnan, and
she is now a professor at

00:12:55.790 --> 00:13:01.690
Wellesley college right here in
Wellesley, Massachusetts.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:05.640
So, her poem entitled "Days of
our half lives," is from her

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.900
collection of chemistry poetry,
"Chemistry for the

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:16.360
Couch Potato." And this
particular poem involves the

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:21.690
uranium 238 decay series.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:23.760
So, here we go.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.520
"Days of our half lives.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.050
My dearest love, I writing
you to tell you all

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.450
that I've been through.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:38.720
I've changed my whole identity,
but loved, I can not

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.380
pretend to be.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:45.950
When I was uranium 238, you
were on my case to start

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:46.690
losing weight.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:52.580
For 5 billion years I'd hoped
and I prayed, and finally I

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:55.890
had an alpha decay.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:14:00.200
Two protons, two neutrons went
right out the door, and now I

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.230
was thorium 234.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:07.630
But my nucleus was still unfit
for your eyes, not positive

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.970
enough for it's large size.

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:14.360
But this time my half life was
really not very long, because

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.290
my will to change was
quite strong.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.150
It took just a month, not even
a millennium, to beta decay

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.550
into protactinium.

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:27.490
But you still rejected
me right off the bat,

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:30.050
protactinium, who's
heard of that?

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:35.810
So, beta decay, I did much more
to become uranium 234.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:39.560
Myself again, but a new isotope,
you still weren't

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.240
satisfied, but I
still had hope.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.850
Three alpha decays, it was hard,
but I stayed on through

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:51.120
thorium, through radium,
and then radon.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.170
I thought I would finally please
you, my mass was a

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:59.420
healthy 222, but you said,
although I like your mass, I

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:04.500
do not want to be with
a noble gas.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.810
You had a point, I wasn't
reactive, so in order to

00:15:07.810 --> 00:15:10.140
please you, I stayed
proactive.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:13.420
A few days later I found you
and said, two more alpha

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:18.870
decays and now I am lead.

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:22.270
You shook your head, you
were not too keen on my

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.310
mass number of 214.

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.730
I had a bad experience with that
mass before, an unstable

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:32.660
acitone walked right
out the door.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:36.350
So in order to change, I went
away, but all I could do was

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.330
just beta decay.

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:41.710
My hopes and my dreams started
to go under, because beta

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:45.120
decays don't change
a mass number.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:50.310
To bismuth, then polonium, I
hoped and I beckoned, my half

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.110
life was 164 micro seconds.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:57.510
And then finally I alpha decayed
and then I was lead

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.130
with the prize worthy
mass of 210.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.030
I've got to admit I was getting
quite tired, my

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.110
patience with you had
nearly expired.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:12.910
You were more demanding than
any I dated, and much of my

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:17.800
energy had already
been liberated.

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:20.920
But you still weren't happy,
but you had a fix, I really

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:25.930
like the number of 206, So I
waited for years until the

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:30.310
day, which began with another
beta decay, and then one more,

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:34.010
and finally in the
end I alpha-ed to

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.020
lead 206, my friend.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:40.260
To change any further I wouldn't
be able, no longer

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.560
active, but happily stable.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.940
It took me billions of years
to do, and look how I've

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:49.640
changed and all just for you.

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.180
And wait, what did you say?

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.460
You've gotten so old that
I'd rather be with a

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:02.280
young lass of gold?

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.740
Well, I give up, we're
through, my pumpkin.

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.300
Shouldn't all my effort be
counting for something?

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.440
Well, you won't be able to rule
me any more, because I'm

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:16.360
leaving you, not for
one atom, but four.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:20.350
That's right, when you were
away defusing, I met some

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:24.770
chlorines that I found
quite amusing.

00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:31.490
So we're going to form lead c l
4, and you won't be hearing

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.360
from me any more.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.040
See, over the years I've grown
quite wise, I've learned that

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.230
love is about compromise.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:43.650
You still have half of your half
lives to live, so now you

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:48.500
go out there, it's your
turn to give."

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:58.320
And that is "The days of our
half lives." So, Mala takes

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.490
great effort to make sure that
all her poetry not only

00:18:01.490 --> 00:18:04.450
rhymes, but it is chemically
correct.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:08.430
So, it's a good way to review
material to read "Chemistry

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:12.590
from the Couch Potato."

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.750
All right, so let's do an
example now and think about

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:19.950
how things will change
over time.

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.520
So we have an example, we want
to know the original activity,

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:26.210
and the activity after 17 years

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.670
of a sample of plutonium.

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.480
So let's take a look at how
we'll do this problem.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.700
So first, given the information
up there, the

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.540
first thing we want
to do is find the

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:44.840
original number of nuclei.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:53.070
So first, capital N o, the
original number of nuclei.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:57.750
So, we're given information
about grams, so we have 0 .

00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:03.670
5 grams. And now if we want to
know the number of nuclei,

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:08.260
what's the first thing
I have to do?

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.270
Convert from grams to what?

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:11.980
STUDENT: Moles.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.190
PROFESSOR: Moles, right.

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:19.250
And here we want to use the
molecular mass that's given to

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.970
us in the form of
that isotope.

00:19:20.970 --> 00:19:29.190
So here, we are given
information about 239, and so

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:34.710
that's the number we want to
use in our conversions.

00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:37.460
So we can convert that over,
but that's going to give us

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:42.410
moles, so how do we go from
moles to molecules?

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:50.780
Avagadro's number, 6.022
times 10 to the 23.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:53.260
This time we're going to talk
about it in terms of nuclei

00:19:53.260 --> 00:20:00.160
per mole, and so that's going
to give us 1.3 times

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.070
10 to the 21 nuclei.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:13.210
OK, so now we know the original
number of nuclei.

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.470
The next thing we're going
to want to do is find k.

00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:23.280
And k is our rate constant for
decay or our decay constant.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.970
So what do we know about k for
a first order process?

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:34.310
We know the equation for what?

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.490
For first order half
life, right.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:38.210
So that's o .

00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:44.610
6 9 3 1 over t 1/2.

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.510
And in this problem we were
given, the half life, and

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.890
often you will be given the half
life or you can look it

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:55.350
up, and so we can put that
in, so we have 0 .

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:59.710
6 9 3 1 over 7 .

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:04.830
6 times 10 to the 11 seconds.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:09.270
And we can calculate our
constant, which is 9 .

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:18.250
1 times 10 to the minus
13 per second.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:21.430
So now we were asked to find the
original activity and the

00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:27.930
activity after 17 years.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:34.770
So, first we'll find the
original activity, and the

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:39.940
original activity is going to be
equal to our rate constant

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.900
times our original
number of nuclei.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:46.000
So we've just solved for both of
these, so we can plug these

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.160
in, so we had 9 .

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:56.070
1 times 10 the minus 13 per
second times the number of

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:57.690
nuclei, 1 .

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:05.360
3 times 10 to the 21
nuclei, equals 1 .

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:12.660
2 times 10 to the 9, and what
are the units here?

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:22.910
It's just like a hum, it's
hard to understand.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.390
STUDENT: Nuclei per second.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:30.430
PROFESSOR: Nuclei per second,
which is the same as what?

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:34.080
That's equal to something
else.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:39.410
Yup, so that's the same as the
Becquerel or the Bq, so it's

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:43.280
defined as nuclei per second,
or number of disintegrations

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.740
per second.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:59.220
All right, so let's
do the last one.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:10.130
OK, so now after 17 years, so
now we can say that the

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:14.660
activity at some time is equal
to the original activity, e to

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:20.590
the minus k t, and we can put
in the activity that we just

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:21.820
found, which is 1 .

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:31.250
2 times 10 to the 9 Bq, times e
to the minus k, which is 9 .

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:38.100
1 times 10 to the minus 13 per
second times 17 years, which

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.130
in seconds is 5 .

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:44.190
4 times 10 to the 8 second.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.610
So here, we want to make sure
that our units are going to

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.230
cancel, and this is where
people often run into

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:54.130
problems. They'll plug in 17
years, and then a rate

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:57.470
constant, which was calculated
in seconds, and things will

00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:59.210
not cancel appropriately.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:02.500
So make sure that you get your
units consistent so that your

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.310
seconds are going to cancel.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:11.530
And so this term, if we do the
math out here with the number

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:15.560
significant figures, we find
that that equals 1.2

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.660
times 10 to 9 Bq.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:22.260
That term is insignificant
in our problem.

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:27.110
So, the original radioactivity
and the activity after 17

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:32.420
years are the same in terms of
the significant figures.

00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.480
And so, I choose this problem to
emphasize a problem that we

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.810
have, and that is radioactive
waste.

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:46.190
It takes a very long time for
some compounds to decay.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.690
And so you have to think about
storing radioactive waste, and

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.050
think about a container
that will outlast

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.760
that radioactive waste.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.900
And how do you know that the
container is going to outlast

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.000
the radioactive waste.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.860
You can't really do an
experiment because the time

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:05.770
involved in doing the
experiment, anyone who designs

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:08.630
the container won't be alive by
the time you're concerned

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:12.980
about whether the container is
going to be stable or not.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:16.380
So taking radioactivity
is an issue.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:19.300
You heard some in the
presidential campaign about

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.190
whether both candidates believe
in nuclear energy or

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:27.340
not, and I think that both of
them said, it needs to be

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.320
considered, we need to have
everything on the table.

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:34.340
If we're going to have a real
uniform energy policy, we need

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.660
to think about everything.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:39.320
So, issues of radioactive
waste and how to handle

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:43.290
radioactivity safely are going
to come back as being current,

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.490
important topics.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.180
And so these may be topics
that you will, in your

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:50.340
lifetime, have to deal with,
either as a scientist trying

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.420
to come up with new
technologies, or as a citizen

00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:57.420
deciding whether having a
radioactive plant in your

00:25:57.420 --> 00:25:59.660
hometown is a good
idea or not.

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.850
A lot of people are happy about
nuclear energy, as long

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:06.260
as the power plants are nowhere
located near them.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:09.560
But, these are things that
you'll have to face, and you

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.130
probably will be voting on this
in the future, if not

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.900
dealing with it directly.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:19.770
So that's how you do
a problem in this.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:23.280
All right, so let's talk
about a medical use of

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.690
radioactivity.

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.010
Radioactivity can definitely
be our friend, as well as

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:30.290
something to be concerned
about.

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:33.920
And I think I mentioned this in
the first day of class, one

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.990
of the ways that the Chemistry
Department has moved to being

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:40.980
the number one ranked Chemistry
Department of U.S.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:45.230
News and World Report over the
years, is a little extra money

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.770
that came in from the work of
-- a patent from Professor

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.720
Alan Davidson that we were
able to do some pretty

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:55.070
exciting things with that
money over the years.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.900
So I always like to mention
all the great money-making

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:03.940
discoveries that occurred using
511-1 material, and this

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:05.690
is another example.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:10.580
So, he used an isotope of
technetium, and it's being

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:17.900
used organ scanning, bone scans,
it's one of the leading

00:27:17.900 --> 00:27:19.490
ones for heart imaging.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.920
It's also been used recently
in breast cancer.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.440
It's estimated 7 million uses
annually in the U.S. And so,

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:33.070
this was patented as cardiolite,
and it's really

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:35.180
just very simple chemistry.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.240
So you're using a d block metal,
an isotope of a d block

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.110
metal, which has your
exciting d orbitals.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:47.180
And what did he do, he made a
coordination complex with that

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:51.070
metal, an isotope of it, and
he found ligands, cyanide

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.770
ligands, those are pretty
common ligands.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.410
You've seen a lot of
coordination complexes with

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.530
cyanide ligands, and he tried
different ligands to get the

00:27:59.530 --> 00:28:04.090
desired properties of stability
and solubility, and

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:05.410
that's all it was.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:08.980
So he used some knowledge of
radioactivity, knowledge of

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:12.190
inorganic chemistry -- he was
an inorganic chemist, he's

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:13.310
retired now.

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:17.340
And simple coordination
chemistry, and made an

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:21.110
enormous amount of money for
MIT, and particularly, the

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:24.000
Chemistry Department,
and also, this has

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.160
saved a lot of lives.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:28.710
So, imaging is something
that chemists

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:30.460
do a lot of, actually.

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:35.110
Not just imaging for cancer or
imaging of organs, but also

00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:38.470
imaging of live cells to try
to understand how the cell

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.090
works when it's healthy.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:43.840
And so recently, Professor Alice
Ting, in the Chemistry

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:49.630
Department, received an NIH
pioneer award, NIH is National

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.400
Institutes of Health, and
started giving these pioneer

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.740
awards for people coming up with
very innovative ideas,

00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:00.870
the kind of innovative ideas
that most people would not

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:03.150
want to fund, because there's
a good chance it might not

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.740
work, but if it did, it
would be spectacular.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.490
So she received one of these
awards for trying to develop

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:13.360
technology to image
protein-protein interactions

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.120
in living cells, which is
something that people would

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.930
really, really love
to be able to do.

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:20.520
And so she is involved in
developing technology.

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.480
So developing of imaging tools
is something that a lot of

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.590
chemists do, it's a very popular
area in chemistry.

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:28.380
And if it's something that
you're interested in, there's

00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:31.020
definitely a lot of people
around that you could think

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.290
about working with for
a UROP position.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:37.960
OK, so that is first order.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.400
And now let's go on and talk
about second order

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.290
integrated rate laws.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.670
And we're going to have a little
derivation for you, I

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:48.380
always like to warn people that
it's coming, because all

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:51.830
of a sudden equations are coming
in and out, and you

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:55.280
just want to know where these
equations are coming from.

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.640
So, as we talked about last
time, this is an expression

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.790
for rate law.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.480
You have your rate constant,
your concentration of

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.380
something, a, and it's raised
to a coefficient, and here

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:09.960
that coefficient is 2,
indicating it's a

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.700
second order process.

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:17.140
So if there's nothing
up there, that's 1.

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:21.840
And then 2, and again, the order
of the reaction can be

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:25.640
positive, negative, it can be
integers, it can be fractions.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:29.420
But this is second order,
so we have 2.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.710
Now, as we did with the first
order expression, we're going

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:36.560
to separate our concentration
terms and our time terms. So

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:39.240
we're going to bring our
concentration term over to one

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.610
side, another concentration term
here, and we're going to

00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:47.400
have our rate constant and our
time term on the other side.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.640
And now we're going to
integrate, because it is an

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.420
integrated rate law.

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:55.030
So we can integrate from the
original concentration of a to

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:59.760
the concentration of a at some
time, t, and then we'll also

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:02.740
integrate from zero time
to that time, t,

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:04.460
on the other side.

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.880
Now, I'm going to take this
expression and just bring it

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.490
up to the top of the page,
so that's the exact same

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.590
expression, nothing
has happened.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.170
And now we're going to
solve that integral.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:17.550
So we can solve that integral,
and if you want to look at

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.730
these -- the back of your
textbook has all of these

00:31:20.730 --> 00:31:23.950
conversions, if you want
to look at them.

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:26.400
So, we're going to solve that
integral, now we have minus

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:31.040
parentheses 1 over the
concentration of a at some

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.150
time, t, minus 1 over the
original concentration

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.940
equals minus k t.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.560
We can get rid of some
of these minus signs.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:46.110
So we're going to bring the
concentration of time, t, over

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:49.050
on this side, we have our k t,
and now we have this other

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.940
term, the original concentration
term is on the

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:57.950
other side, and this is
expressed in a certain way

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:01.720
that gives you the equation
for a straight line.

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:05.530
And again, kinetics, you need
experimental data for

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.630
kinetics, and so when you
measure your data, you plot

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:11.800
your data, and so there's a lot
of equations for straight

00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.450
lines that you have, because
it's all about trying to plot

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:19.910
data, and figure out what the
order is experimentally.

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:24.090
So, here's an equation for a
straight line, and we can plot

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:59.750
this, and you can tell me what
the intercept of this line is.

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:13.020
OK, let's just take
10 more seconds.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.680
Yup, so all of you know how to
analyze the equation for a

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.990
straight line.

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:26.650
So, here we have 1 over the
original concentration, and

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:32.980
then our slope is equal
to what here? k.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.500
So, you can plot your data as
your concentration of a

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:37.610
changes with time.

00:33:37.610 --> 00:33:41.640
You can plot the data, and if
the data, if it's plotted as 1

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.700
over the concentration of a
versus time and it gives you a

00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.250
straight line, that's consistent
with it being a

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:50.940
second order process.

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:54.700
So, in terms of second order
half life, we talked about

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.590
first order half life, and for
any half life, it's just the

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:04.530
time it takes for half of the
original material to go away.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.940
So we can rewrite this and
take a to the t, and

00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:13.100
substitute in the original
concentration divided by 2,

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:18.080
and then we can have t have a
special name t 1/2, so that's

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.500
the half life.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.410
And now we can just simplify
this expression.

00:34:23.410 --> 00:34:26.770
We can bring the 2 up here,
and now we can combine our

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.970
concentration terms
on the side.

00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:32.890
So we take 2, we bring
this over, minus 1.

00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:37.440
And that simplifies 1 over the
concentration of the original

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.720
material here.

00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.940
And now we can solve for it
in terms of the half life.

00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:49.760
So the half life for a second
order process equals 1 over k

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:54.780
times the original concentration
of the material.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:35:01.140
So, a second order half life
depends on the starting

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.640
concentration.

00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:05.460
So that's very different from
a first order half life

00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:10.260
process where concentration
term cancels out entirely.

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:14.480
So for a first order process,
the concentration of the

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:19.280
original material does not
affect the half life, or for

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:23.010
radioactive decay, the original
number of nuclei --

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.950
it's independent of how
many nuclei were

00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:27.300
around at the time.

00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.960
But for second order process,
the starting concentration

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:36.160
does matter.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.920
So again, chemistry
is experimental.

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:41.870
And so what you would be doing
in a lab, you would be trying

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.720
to figure out what the order of
the reaction is, and so you

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.080
could try out your data.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.130
You say I don't know if it's
first or second order, so for

00:35:50.130 --> 00:35:53.200
a first order plot, you're
going to be plotting the

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:56.600
natural log of your
concentrations versus time,

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.680
and if second order, you plot
1 over the concentration

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:00.730
versus time.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.250
And so you could plot your data
and see that oh, look at

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:08.040
this, it fits a straight line
really well if I plot it as 1

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.680
over the concentration.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:13.170
If I plot it as the natural
log versus time, the data

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:14.850
doesn't fit a straight
line at all.

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:18.700
So this is not a first order
process, this is much more

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.230
consistent with a second
order process.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.550
So again, figuring out where
something is first order or

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:31.850
second order is done
experimentally.

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:32.280
All right.

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:35.110
Now we're going to talk
about kinetics

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:37.330
and equilibrium constants.

00:36:37.330 --> 00:36:40.740
So, I always get very excited,
as you know, when we come back

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.660
to equilibrium constants, so am
always very happy at this

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.370
time in the course when we
can relate kinetics and

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:50.690
equilibrium constants.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.580
So, at equilibrium, another
way to think about what's

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:56.960
happening at equilibrium, is
that the rate of the forward

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.210
reaction and the rate of the
reverse reaction are equal to

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:04.310
each other.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:08.470
So, we can now talk about big
letter K, which is our

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:11.780
equilibrium constant again,
and our little letter k's,

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.730
which our rate constant.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:17.670
So the equilibrium constant for
a chemical reaction a plus

00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:21.600
b equals c plus d is going to
be equal to what, what do I

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:25.560
put on the top?

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:31.070
Concentration of? c, and
concentration of d, right.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:34.570
So our products, and at
the bottom we put our

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:41.180
concentration of our reactants,
or a and b.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:47.210
Now, we can also think about
this reaction in terms of

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:50.090
little rate constants.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:56.330
So we have small letter k 1 on
top, and small letter k to the

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:59.070
minus 1 on the bottom.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:03.100
So, the forward reaction, the
rate of forward reaction is

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:08.440
going to be equal to k 1 times
the concentration of a and the

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.740
concentration of b.

00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:16.600
And on the bottom, our rate is
going to be equal to the

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.120
little rate constant, so for the
reverse reaction it's the

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.730
reverse rate constant, k minus
1, and in the reverse

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:27.440
direction, our reactants are the
products for the forward

00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:32.780
direction, or c and d.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.610
So, here we have these rates,
and at equilibrium, those

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:39.220
rates are going to be equal.

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.300
So at equilibrium, little k 1, a
times b is going to be equal

00:38:43.300 --> 00:38:47.890
to little k minus 1
times c times d.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:59.460
And at equilibrium we had c d
over a b is equal to then k 1

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:04.290
over k minus 1, so if we just
rearrange this expression and

00:39:04.290 --> 00:39:08.250
move the rate constants to one
side and concentration terms

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:11.210
to the other side, this
expression is the same as this

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:15.210
expression, and we also know
what this expression is equal

00:39:15.210 --> 00:39:20.800
to, which is our big K. So,
therefore, our equilibrium

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.840
constant equals the rate
constant for the forward

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:26.700
reaction over the rate constant

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.660
for the reverse direction.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:32.780
And so here is an expression
that compares equilibrium

00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:37.920
constants with rate constants.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.760
So now, let's think about
what is true about this.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.800
So our equilibrium constant,
then, is the ratio or the

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.000
forward rate over the
reverse rate for

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.690
these elementary reactions.

00:39:51.690 --> 00:39:55.880
And if we think about rate
constants in kinetics terms,

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.380
if k is greater than 1, if there
are more products than

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.920
reactants at equilibrium,
what's true about k

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.560
1 and k minus 1?

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:12.670
Is k 1 greater than or
less than k minus 1?

00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:13.820
Right.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:17.100
So the forward rate constant
is greater than the reverse

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:19.410
rate constant.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:23.810
And if K, big equilibrium
constant, K is less than 1, if

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:28.690
at equilibrium there are more
reactants than products, what

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:33.240
is true about this
relationship?

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:35.590
It would be less than.

00:40:35.590 --> 00:40:39.070
So, you can think about
equilibrium constants now in

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:42.070
terms of rate constants, which
we'll be doing a lot on

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.870
Wednesday, too.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:44.980
All right.

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:48.920
So let me introduce you to a
couple of more terms in the

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:50.270
last few minutes.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:53.990
So reactions don't usually occur
in one step, but occur

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:55.820
in a series of steps.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:02.070
Each step is called an
elementary reaction.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:07.340
So, the overall reaction, the
order and the rate law, can be

00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:13.180
derived from the stoichiometry
for an overall reaction, you

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.370
can't use the stoichiometry,
but for an elementary

00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:18.000
reaction you can.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.120
So, for an elementary reaction,
say one step in the

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:25.010
reaction mechanism, that step
occurs exactly as written so

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:27.750
you can use stoichiometry.

00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:31.190
And that's going to be handy in
coming up with mechanisms.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:35.010
So, let's just look at one
example very briefly.

00:41:35.010 --> 00:41:38.780
So here we have the
decomposition of ozone, which

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:42.790
is another environmental issue
that you will be faced with in

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:45.760
your lifetime.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:49.940
So this is the overall reaction,
and you can't use

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.160
the stoiciomery to figure out
the order of the reaction, but

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.760
if you divide it up into
elementary reaction steps,

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:01.000
then you can use the stoiciomery
to write the rate

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.920
law for each step of
that reaction.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.740
So, the first step here is
a unimolecular step.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:15.130
You have one thing going to two
things, and molecularity

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.760
is the number of reactant
molecules the come together to

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:20.060
form product.

00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:24.410
So, unimolecular you just have
one thing that's forming some

00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:26.020
kind of product.

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:28.350
What do you think it's called
if you have two

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:32.260
things forming a product?

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:34.030
Bimolecular.

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:37.460
These are good little one or two
point questions on a test,

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:40.660
they're not very hard,
they should be pretty

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:42.410
easy to think about.

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:46.110
So, we have unimolecular,
examples would be some kind of

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.800
decomposition or radioactive
decay.

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:50.930
Bimolecular, two reactants
coming

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:52.740
together to form products.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:57.040
And termolecular is three
reactants coming together to

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.770
form a product, and
that's rare.

00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:03.930
And you can remember that it's
rare if you think about how

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:07.120
you would hold three tennis
balls in your hand and have

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:10.620
them all come together at the
same time to form product,

00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:12.530
that is a difficult
thing to do.

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:14.750
Two things coming together
is easy,

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:16.800
bimolecular is very common.

00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:21.220
Termolecular not very common,
that they'd all come together

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:25.090
at the same time to
form a product.

00:43:25.090 --> 00:43:32.310
All right, so we can write rate
laws for each step here.

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:36.000
For the first step here, the
rate would be equal to a k --

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.490
I don't have the k written up
here, but there's always going

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:40.850
to be a little k
over the arrow.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:44.770
So, k times the reactant
would be here.

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:48.740
For bimolecular, again,
assume a k over there.

00:43:48.740 --> 00:44:13.910
What's that rate going
to be equal to?

00:44:13.910 --> 00:44:16.890
OK, let's just take 10
more seconds since

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:27.900
class is almost over.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:34.700
Yup, so it's this one
right down here.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.970
So we have the rate
is equal to k

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:39.370
times these two reactants.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:43.760
You can sum up the steps and
get the overall reactants.

00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:47.300
Notice that o is an
intermediate, it's formed

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:48.920
here, decayed here.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.070
It goes away, and so o doesn't
appear in the overall

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:54.250
expression.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:56.190
So we're going to talk
a lot about reaction

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.700
intermediates next time.

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.730
And also, remember that you
can't prove reaction

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.700
mechanisms to be correct,
they're just consistent with

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:07.720
the data that you have.

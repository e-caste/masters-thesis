BOGDAN FEDELES: Hello, and
welcome to 5.07 Bio Chemistry

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.030
Online.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.360
I'm Dr. Bogdan Fedeles.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.660
Let's metabolize some problems.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.470
Today we're going to be
talking about Problem 2

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.300
of Problem Set 4.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.400
Here we're going to be
discussing in detail

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.080
the mechanism of HMG-CoA
synthase, a key enzyme

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.290
in central metabolism
responsible for making the five

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.570
carbon building
blocks from which

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.580
all sterols, such as cholesterol
and steroid hormones are made.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.240
HMG-CoA synthase catalyzes
the following reaction.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.870
It takes acetyl-CoA,
which we're going

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.450
to encounter a lot in
the central metabolism,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.450
and combines it with
acetoacetyl-CoA,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.420
another thioester.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.112
In this process, the one
molecule of CoA is lost,

00:01:24.112 --> 00:01:25.945
and we get the product
hydroxymethylglutaryl

00:01:25.945 --> 00:01:32.410
CoA or HMG-CoA, as you notice
the initials H, M, and G are

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.970
part of this name.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.850
To help us understand
the mechanism,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.450
a crystal structure of
this HMG-CoA synthase

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.690
is provided in this problem,
and it's shown here.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.130
Question 1 of this
problem is asking

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.830
us to provide a
detailed curved arrow

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.260
mechanism of the
reaction catalyzed

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.510
by the HMG-CoA synthase.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.750
And for that we're going to
use the information provided

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.560
in the crystal structure.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.950
And we are also given
an additional hint

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.889
and that is the
acetyl CoA substrate

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:19.350
provides the CH2CO2 CO2 minus
moiety in the HMG-CoA product.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.730
Let's take a look.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.330
So the hint is telling us
that these two carbons, which

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.180
I'm going to label in
blue from acetyl-CoA,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.990
are, in fact, these
two carbons, CH2 COO

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.070
minus in
hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.220
That means that the other
four carbons in the product

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.920
must be the carbons from
the acetoacetyl-CoA.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.030
Let's label these red.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.470
So now since we have a thioester
functionality in both cases,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.630
these are probably the
same, so the carbons

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.960
from a acetoacetyl-CoA
are as follows.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.470
So notice the
HMG-CoA synthase, it

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.330
accomplishes the formation
of a carbon-carbon bond,

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.600
and that is this
bond right here.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.220
It's between the CH3
carbon acetyl-CoA

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.290
and the carbonyl carbon
of acetoacetyl-CoA.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.300
And in the process,
this carbonyl

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.012
will become a hydroxyl group.

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:31.970
Now, let's take a look
at the crystal structure

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.850
and see what information
we can gather there.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.830
Now this is a picture
of the active site

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.890
of the HMG-CoA synthase.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.630
We notice the acetyl-CoA
moiety is actually

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.700
now bound to this C111.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.790
As you know C is a cysteine--

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.470
so it's actually
covalently bound

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.560
to a cysteine-- in
the active site.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.080
Now, notice this is
the other substrate,

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.850
which is the acetoacetyl-CoA
and bound in the active site.

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.410
So as we've discussed
before, we're

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.630
going to make this
carbon-carbon bond,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.030
and that's going to
happen between this carbon

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.700
here and this carbon here.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.780
So this bond needs to be formed.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.490
However, let's take
it one step at a time.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:21.399
The reaction will
start by forming

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:25.480
this thioester between the
acetoacetyl-CoA carbons

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.800
and the cysteine in the
active site of the enzyme.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.980
In many reactions that use a
cysteine in the active site,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.250
which is used to form a
covalent bond to the substrate,

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.760
we first need a base to
deprotonate the cysteine

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.640
and make it a really
good nucleophile, which

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.680
will subsequently
attack the substrate

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.800
and form a covalent bond.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.920
Now, in a lot of these cases,
the base is a histidine.

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.960
Let's take a look if we see
a histidine in our structure.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.760
There is a histidine
in the structure, H233.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.350
But if you look
at this histidine,

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:04.530
it's quite far from
our cysteine here.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.895
Well, obviously, because
this is a projection,

00:05:07.895 --> 00:05:10.020
this is a two-dimensional
structure so that we only

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.311
see here a projection of a
three-dimensional structure,

00:05:12.311 --> 00:05:14.460
it's very hard for us to
tell if this histidine is,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.340
in fact, close enough to
deprotonate this cysteine.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.080
So even though we have
this crystal structure,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.640
from this one picture, we do
not have enough information

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.190
to figure out, well,
what is the base that

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.180
will deprotonate cysteine before
it reacts with acetyl-CoA.

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.690
Remember this is often the case
with crystal structures that

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.630
because of the resolution
which we can collect them,

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.535
we cannot see the protons.

00:05:43.535 --> 00:05:44.910
And if we cannot
see the protons,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.900
it's very hard to tell which
amino acid residues are

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.810
protonated and can serve as a
general acid or general bases.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.360
A lot of the
researcher's intuition

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.140
comes into play to draw
these kind of structures.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:02.320
And it's only with collecting
many different kinds

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.410
of experimental evidence
that we can put together

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.250
a more definitive mechanism.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.770
Therefore, we might
not know for sure

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.910
from this one picture, which
is the general base that

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.510
deprotonates the
cysteine at 111.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.840
So we're not going
to assign it for now.

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.900
Let's try to write the
mechanism for that part.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.340
Here is the
acetyl-CoA substrate,

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.565
and here is the active
site cysteine 111

00:06:35.565 --> 00:06:38.630
with its thiol group.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.270
And again, we're not
going to assign it,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:47.190
but there will be a base in the
active site of the enzyme that

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.966
will need to deprotonate this
cysteine before it can react.

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:55.350
Therefore, the
reaction first involves

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:58.720
activation of the cysteine,
is deprotonated, and then

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.640
cysteine can attack
the thioester

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.181
and form a tetrahedral
intermediate.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.890
As we've seen it before,
for a lot of these reactions

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.170
involving thioesters.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.780
In the first step, we
will form four bonds

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:24.050
to this carbonyl
carbon, and we have

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:29.060
formed a new bond between
the thiol of the cysteine 111

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:32.750
and the starting
material, acetyl-CoA.

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:36.070
Of course, there is a
negative charge here.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.310
And our base in the
active site of the enzyme

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.051
will now be protonated.

00:07:44.149 --> 00:07:45.690
Now that the
tetrahedral intermediate

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:53.820
is going to fall apart by
kicking off the CoA moiety.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.880
Of course, this will get
protonated presumably

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.840
by the same base.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:03.420
Now it's a general acid
that will protonate a CoA.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:09.300
So we obtain the thioester with
the cysteine in the active site

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:15.980
and one molecule of CoA
is going to be leaving.

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.710
And here is our base.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.420
Notice the tetrahedral
intermediate

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.160
that we're forming here.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.232
We have an oxygen that
develops a negative charge.

00:08:25.232 --> 00:08:27.440
And this is very similar to
the kinds of intermediate

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.730
you've seen in the serine
protease mechanism.

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.830
Now in that case,
such an intermediate

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.200
was stabilized
with hydrogen bonds

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.110
from the backbone of the
protein in a structure that

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:42.110
was called an oxyanion hole.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.260
Now let's take a look at the
crystal structure of HMG-CoA

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.050
to see how a tetrahedral
intermediate might

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.700
be stabilized.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:55.330
Here is the acetyl of the
acetoacetyl-CoA substrate.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.070
The acetyl now is
bound to the cysteine

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.590
111 here in the active site.

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:04.640
Now, let's take a look if there
are any other residues close

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:08.450
enough to this oxygen. One
of them that's shown here

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:13.580
is this NH, which belongs to an
amide bond, the backbone amide,

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:16.985
and that's part of the
amino acid serine 307.

00:09:16.985 --> 00:09:20.870
So this distance
here, C3.06 Angstrom,

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:26.860
it's actually close enough for
a fairly good hydrogen bond.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.980
Presumably, this interaction
will stabilize the binding

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:35.080
of acetyl-CoA in this
region of the active site

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:39.150
and may also be
involved in catalyzing

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:42.242
the reaction with the
cysteine by stabilizing

00:09:42.242 --> 00:09:43.450
the tetrahedral intermediate.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.220
In that case, this
distance will have

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:51.190
to become even smaller, that is
to form a really good hydrogen

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.550
bond on the order of
2.6, 2.7 Angstrom.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.740
Since this is only one
snapshot of the reaction,

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.560
we don't have enough
information to tell if this is

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.500
a key catalytical interaction.

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.930
Once acetyl-CoA has
reacted with the enzyme,

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.260
hence, formed the thioester
with the cysteine 111,

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.550
we're now ready to
proceed with the reaction

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.940
and form a carbon-carbon bond.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:16.990
Let's take a look.

00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:19.510
So in the next step
of the reaction,

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.590
we want to form a carbon-carbon
bond between this methyl

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:27.630
group here and this
carbon of the carbonyl

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.070
of the other substrate.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:35.530
So first of all, we need to
deprotonate this methyl group.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.780
We're going to form an enolate.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.090
Then the enolate is going
to attack this carbonyl.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.580
Once again, we look for a
suitable base, and we see,

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:50.770
for example, this glutamate
79 may be, in fact,

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.850
serving as a general base to
deprotonate the methyl group

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:56.800
here and form the enolate.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:02.050
Once the enolate is formed, it's
going to attack this carbonyl,

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.580
and this oxygen
is going to start

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.050
developing a negative charge,
which needs to be compensated

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.050
by a general acid.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:14.620
And it looks like this
histidine 233 is close enough

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:19.010
to donate a proton and
generate a hydroxyl group here.

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:19.510
All right.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:22.360
So let's try to write
a mechanism based

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.070
on what we just said.

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:31.720
Here is the thioester between
cysteine 111 and acetyl.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.620
And let's show the general base.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.240
It's going to be glutamate 79.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:44.300
Because it's a base, I'm going
to put a negative charge on it.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.960
There you go.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.720
And this will serve
to deprotonate

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:57.770
the methyl from the acetyl,
moiety here, and generate

00:11:57.770 --> 00:11:58.865
an enolate.

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:05.540
So it's picking up a
proton, electron move,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:11.050
and it's going to generate,
as before, a negative charge

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.060
on the oxygen, which
may be stabilized

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.430
by that interaction with
the [INAUDIBLE] hydrogen

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:20.773
that we just discussed.

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:27.160
Now, let's try this again.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.692
And here is our enolate.

00:12:33.692 --> 00:12:35.630
In the next step,
the enolate now

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.920
is going to attack the
carbonyl of the acetoacetyl-CoA

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.680
and form the carbon-carbon bond.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:47.720
All right.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:52.030
This is the
acetoacetyl-CoA, and we

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.630
discussed that
next to this oxygen

00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:04.980
there is our histidine
233, which we're going

00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.420
to show it as being protonated.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:12.360
Therefore, the reaction
proceeds as follows.

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.960
Here we're forming the
carbon-carbon bond.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:19.350
Then the oxygen is
going to pick up

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.260
the proton from the
protonated histidine

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:24.430
and it's going to
form a hydroxyl group.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:32.140
Therefore, we get
cysteine 111 is still

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:40.870
attached to what is known
the HMG-CoA product.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.520
So this is our carbon.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.700
This is the new
carbon-carbon bond.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.080
We have here a methyl group.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:52.440
We have the new hydroxyl,
which were formed here,

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.742
and the rest of the molecule.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.210
And our histidine, it
was protonated here,

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.110
now it's going to
be deprotonated.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:10.590
So we just saw how the
carbon-carbon bond is formed

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.450
in the course of this reaction.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.240
And now we're left with
a six-carbon thioester

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.764
with a cysteine 111 in the
active side of the enzyme.

00:14:20.764 --> 00:14:23.170
Therefore, the last
step of the reaction

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.790
would involve hydrolysis of this
thioester to free the product

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.000
and regenerate the system.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.845
So for the last step, we need
to hydrolyze this thioester,

00:14:34.845 --> 00:14:36.220
and for that,
we're going to need

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.190
to activate a water molecule.

00:14:39.190 --> 00:14:41.740
Once again, we don't know--

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.170
here is the water molecule--

00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:49.080
we don't know what's the
general base, the residue

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.350
in the active site, which
removed this proton from water

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:57.450
to allow it to attack the
carbonyl of the thioester.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:03.360
So we're going to call it
a general base attached

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.010
to the enzyme.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:10.250
So this base is going to
pick a proton from water,

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:14.680
and then the water is going
to add to the carbonyl

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.630
and once again generate a
tetrahedral intermediate.

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:31.350
Say, this the OH
from water, and this

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:33.091
is the rest of the molecule.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.790
Once again, this is a
tetrahedral intermediate, very

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.950
similar to the one we
saw in the first step

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:46.770
when we formed this thioester,
and presumably, it's

00:15:46.770 --> 00:15:49.800
going to be stabilized in
a fairly similar manner.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:55.430
Let's also show that this
base attached to the enzyme

00:15:55.430 --> 00:16:02.270
is now protonated,
and it would probably

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.920
donate this proton to
reprotonate the cysteine

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:07.240
and reform that thiol group.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:15.130
So in the second step,
thiol takes the electrons,

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:18.889
which picks up the proton
from the general base

00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:19.680
in the active site.

00:16:23.075 --> 00:16:24.910
So at this point,
we're just going

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:30.120
to release the thiol
of the cysteine 111,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:38.490
and the rest of the molecule
is exactly our product,

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.200
which is the HMG-CoA.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:47.240
The curved arrow
mechanism we just wrote

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:48.960
answers part 1 of the problem.

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:53.920
Second question
of this problem is

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.570
asking about the
stabilization of

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:57.940
the tetrahedral intermediate,
which actually we

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.710
have just discussed.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.500
But let me reiterate
as you guys saw

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.121
in the serine
protease mechanisms,

00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:07.329
whenever we're forming this
tetrahedral intermediate,

00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:12.190
they tend to be stabilized
in an oxyanion hole, which

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:17.500
is basically a structure of the
enzyme, which can form hydrogen

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.829
bonds with the partial negative
charge or full negative charge

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:24.130
that develops in a
tetrahedral intermediate.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:26.470
Presumably, similar
structure exists

00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:31.960
for this HMG-CoA synthase, but
because we're only given one

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:34.720
snapshot, one crystal
structure, that is not

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.630
sufficient information
to say for sure which

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.080
are the key interactions
to stabilize

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:43.660
these tetrahedral intermediates.

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.050
A lot more work, a lot
more experimental data

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:51.820
is necessary to figure out
which are the key hydrogen bonds

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:55.231
and interactions that stabilize
the tetrahedral intermediates.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.200
Question 3 is asking us to
review the mechanisms by which

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.200
enzymes can achieve
their amazing rate

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.170
acceleration, which is on
the order of 10 to the 6

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:13.470
to 10 to 15 times over
the uncatalyzed reaction

00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:16.650
and of course, to point out
these mechanisms in the context

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:19.260
of the HMG-CoA synthase.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.040
As you have seen over
and over in this course,

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.360
the three general
mechanisms by which

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:29.230
enzymes accelerate reactions
are binding energy,

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.540
general acid/general
base catalysis

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.330
and covalent catalysis.

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.730
Now let's take a
look at our structure

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:39.370
and figure out how each
one of these mechanisms

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:41.670
might be operating.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.520
To start off,
covalent catalysis,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.900
it's pretty obvious here the
acetyl-CoA substrate first

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:54.070
reacts and forms a covalent
bond with the cysteine

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:58.080
of the HMG-CoA synthase.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:01.260
So this covalent
attachment to the enzyme

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.760
allows this residue to
be positioned just right

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.870
so that it can react
with the other substrate.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.230
Now, general acid/general
base catalysis,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.110
we've seen all these
residues that participate.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.300
Obviously, in order
for this to react,

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.920
we need a base to
deprotonate the cysteine.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.540
Then we need a base,
presumably, this glutamate 79,

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:28.560
to deprotonate the methyl
group here to form the enolate.

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.100
And we need an acid
to stabilize and form

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:38.550
this hydroxyl group that will
be developing on this oxygen.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.080
So covalent catalysis and
general acid/general base

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.980
catalysis, that's
pretty obvious.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:46.360
Now when it comes
to binding energy,

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.740
this is not something
that we can obviously

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.330
derive from the
structure, but we

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:54.660
can postulate the number of
ways in which binding energy

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.610
contributes to this reaction.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.380
First of all, both
of the substrates

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.030
need to bind to the enzyme.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.110
In order to do that, they
need to be desolvated,

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:06.720
that is to remove all the water
molecules that surround them.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:11.640
So that by itself
requires energy.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.620
The binding energy
is also derived

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.970
by when we align the
substrates in the active site

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:23.530
of the enzyme, we align them
so closely the right geometry

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:26.470
and within a few
tenths of an Angstrom

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:30.120
so that the right
orbitals overlap and allow

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.810
the reaction to happen.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.140
So also the ability
to align this residue

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.250
so closely that also contributes
to the binding energy.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.520
And finally, the
binding energy also

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.210
manifests when we're
stabilizing, for example,

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:52.760
the transition state
of the reaction

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.560
relative to the binding
of the substrates.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.090
So if, for example, for our
tetrahedral intermediate

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.830
that will form here, if
that transition state

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.860
or the tetrahedral
intermediate is stabilized more

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.270
than the substrate, then
the reaction is accelerated

00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:11.420
and proceeds towards that pass.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.890
Part 4 of the
problem is asking us

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:20.580
to look up the structure
of coenzyme A, or CoA

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:24.380
and then contrast the
reactivity of say, acetyl-CoA,

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.810
the thioester with CoA, with
the reactivity of a thioester

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.220
with a much smaller thiol group.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:34.050
Let's see what the
coenzyme A looks like.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.070
Here we have the
structure coenzyme A.

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.930
The business end
of the molecule is

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.270
this thiol group,
which is attached

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:44.660
to a substantially long arm.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:47.640
And at the end here, we
have, as you can recognize,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.810
two phosphates, the ribose
and the base adenine.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.390
This is a nucleotide is ADP.

00:21:53.390 --> 00:21:56.330
There's also another
phosphate here.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:59.480
But the business end of the
molecule is this thiol group,

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.120
and we're asked to contrast
whether a thioester

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.200
form with coenzyme A would
behave similarly to a thioester

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.100
form with this right-hand
portion of the molecule, which

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.490
I wrote here.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.270
So it's a much shorter thiol.

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:18.620
Now, it turns out these
thioesters will be very, very

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.980
similar because really it's
only the thiol moiety that we

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.800
need to form thioester.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:31.020
So those thioesters will
behave very, very similarly.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:33.380
Now, the advantage of
having such a long arm

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:37.700
for the coenzyme A is
that it provides a way

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.360
to insert the substrate,
which will attach here,

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.220
to say, acetyl-CoA, to insert
acetyl-CoA in very deep

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.940
into the active
site of the enzyme.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:53.240
Having a long arm to guide the
thioester may be important.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.640
As you will see
later in the course,

00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:59.720
fatty acid synthases, which are
these mega dalton complexes,

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.730
have multiple active sites.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:06.640
So the fatty acid
attaches a thioester

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:09.920
to coenzyme A allows
it to be moved

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.670
through different active
sites and through a same kind

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:17.450
of chemistry in multiple
steps over and over again.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:20.900
The advantage of having
a coenzyme A thioester

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:23.900
is that it may provide some
additional binding energy.

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:25.960
That nucleotide
portion of coenzyme A

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:30.590
may interact specifically
with the enzyme

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:34.640
near the active site,
whereas, a much smaller thiol

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.190
like the one we
just saw will not

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:39.374
have that kind of
interaction available.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.590
Since we've been
talking about thioesters

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.170
throughout this entire
problem, the last question

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.940
is asking us to
rationalize why we're

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:55.630
seeing thioesters in metabolism
as opposed to oxygen esters.

00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:59.140
Now, the key message you
need to remember here

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:03.070
is that the resonance that
we observe in oxygen esters

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.470
is almost completely
absent in thioesters.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.520
And this fact makes the
thioesters less stable

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.560
and therefore, more reactive.

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.110
Not only their carbonyl
group behaves more

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:17.290
like a ketone group, but
their alpha hydrogens

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:19.060
are more acidic.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.620
Let's take a look.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:28.430
Here is an oxygen
ester that shows

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:32.060
a proton in alpha position.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.320
And as you know, the
lone pairs on this oxygen

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.260
can conjugate with
the carbonyl group

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:45.710
and form certain resonance
structures, one of which

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.930
being this one.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:57.216
So the electrons
can move like this,

00:24:57.216 --> 00:24:59.340
and then we're going to
have a negative charge here

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:02.770
and a positive charge here.

00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:07.780
And this is possible because
the electrons on both oxygens

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.010
are found in orbitals
of comparable energies.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:18.640
By contrast, in the case of a
thioester, we have a sulfur.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:23.835
Now, the electrons
on the sulfur are

00:25:23.835 --> 00:25:27.430
in orbitals that are not
in comparable energies

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:31.180
with the ones on the
ketyl group and therefore,

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:41.310
this kind of conjugation
does not, in fact, happen.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:44.040
And because this doesn't
happen, therefore, the electrons

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.740
on the carbonyl stay
localized, and that

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:49.170
makes the carbonyl a
better reactive site.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.620
So it's a better electrophile
to react as nucleophiles

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:55.320
behaves more like a ketone.

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:58.380
For the same reason, when
we are to deprotonate

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:02.010
the alpha position
on a thioester,

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:04.230
the density on the
carbonyl is there

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:07.980
to stabilize the enolate
much more so than it

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.560
would be for an oxygen ester.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:13.590
Therefore, the pKa,
the acidity constant

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.050
for this hydrogen
on the thioesters

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:18.960
is close to 18, which
is smaller, therefore

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.400
more acidic than the pKa of
the alpha position in oxygen

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.350
esters, which is 22.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.210
This sums up Problem
2 of Problem Set 4.

00:26:30.210 --> 00:26:32.280
I hope you now have a
much better feel of how

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.430
we can use crystal
structured data

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:39.020
to propose a
reasonable mechanism

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.190
for enzyme catalyzed reactions.

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:43.440
Keep in mind that writing
mechanisms on paper

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.930
is relatively easy.

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:49.740
But to truly confirm that
that mechanism is taking place

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.340
in real life inside
the cells, it

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:58.020
takes a lot more experimental
work and evidence.

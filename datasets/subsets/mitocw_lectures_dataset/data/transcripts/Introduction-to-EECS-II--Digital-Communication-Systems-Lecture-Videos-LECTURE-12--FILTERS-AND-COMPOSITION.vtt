00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:27.910
PROFESSOR: So we're
going to continue

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.360
talking about LTI systems
and how to work with them.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:41.290
We're thinking of an LTI
model for a channel, something

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.540
with input xn, output yn.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.910
And we've seen
that the output can

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.430
be obtained from the input
through this convolution

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.300
operation, right?

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.230
So for instance, this
was one way to write it.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.810
And the shorthand notation
here was h star x,

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.930
evaluate to the time n.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.500
The m here, in general,
goes from minus infinity

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.010
to plus infinity.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.980
In general, you put a unit
sample function of the input,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.930
the response can extend
from minus infinity

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.870
to infinity if you've
got a non-causal system.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.690
If you've got a causal system
and you put a unit sample in,

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.690
then the response starts from
0 and goes on to the future.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.760
But it's often useful to be
able to represent and analyze

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:38.900
non-causal systems.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.780
I mean, if you have all the
data stored in your computer,

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.975
then you can look forward
and back from the time

00:01:43.975 --> 00:01:44.600
that you're at.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.430
And therefore, you
can do things that

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.500
can be looked at as non-causal
or analyzed as non-causal.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.080
Now, there's one issue
that we've kind of swept

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.700
under the rug, which is you can
write nice looking formulas,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.840
but do they mean anything?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.360
So we went through a
plausible derivation,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.950
but if you end up
with a summation

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.870
from minus infinity to
infinity, then you've

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.020
got to ask yourself when
does this make sense?

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.810
Because you know that adding
an infinite number of things

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.050
can cause problems.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.270
So you need conditions for
all of this to make sense.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.918
For instance, if h was 1 for all
time and x was 1 for all time,

00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:21.710
there's no way this is
going to make sense.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.250
Because it's going to blow up
at every value of n, right?

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.010
So you clearly need conditions.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:35.780
So what we're looking for is
conditions for convolution

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.595
to be well behaved.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.560
And I'm going to give you
one important condition.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.600
Well actually, let
me give you two.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.680
So here's one.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.890
Suppose we have a causal
system and input that

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:16.280
starts from 0 at time 0.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.610
When I say starts out, I
mean that for all prior times

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.050
the input is 0.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.360
So we've got an input that
is 0 for all negative times.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:35.300
And then, at n equals 0 we
start to get some action, OK?

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.050
So let's see, what happens
to this infinite sum

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.340
in this particular case?

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.210
If I have a causal system,
that means that h of n

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:57.310
is 0 for n less than 0, right?

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.060
That's what you should
think of right away

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.220
when you're told a
system is causal.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.340
The unit sample response can
only extend from 0 onwards.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.950
So if the unit sample response
is 0 for a negative time,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:15.530
and the input starts at
time 0, what simplifications

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.130
can you make to that
convolution representation?

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.760
Somebody?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.572
Yeah.

00:04:21.572 --> 00:04:26.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.100
PROFESSOR: 0 to
infinity does it?

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.785
OK, so the answer
was that instead

00:04:31.785 --> 00:04:33.410
of starting at minus
infinity, you only

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.205
need to start the
summation at m equals 0.

00:04:36.205 --> 00:04:37.580
Because the h of
m is going to be

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.590
0 for all negative values of m.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.495
So you can start
that summation at 0.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.740
And then, where
does the summation--

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.494
where can the summation end?

00:04:48.494 --> 00:04:50.490
AUDIENCE: n?

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.160
PROFESSOR: n?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.500
Yeah, because this x here
is 0 for negative values

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.910
of the argument.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.220
Negative values of the argument
are values of m greater than n.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.027
So this only needs to
extend over a finite region.

00:05:06.027 --> 00:05:08.110
Well, if you have a finite
sum, then you're happy.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.670
Nothing's going to blow up.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.410
So this is certainly one case
where everything works fine.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.780
There's another case
which I'll describe

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:24.260
which is where your
input is bounded

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:27.790
and what we mean by
that is that your xn has

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.820
an absolute value
that's less than

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.520
or equal to some maximum value--

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.770
some finite maximum
value for all time.

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.270
So no matter what
n you pick, you're

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.610
always within this interval, OK?

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:47.290
So your input is, here's
your n, here's your plus m,

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.730
here's your minus m.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.640
And your input is
constrained for all time

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.280
to just lie between
these limits.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.830
So that's a bounded input.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.620
And here's the other
part of the condition.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:11.680
Absolute value of hm summed
over all m is finite.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:18.509
We say that h is
absolutely summable--

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.170
absolutely summable.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.060
So what does that do for us?

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.390
Well, it actually allows
us to bound the outputs.

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.370
So now, it turns
out y of n, that's

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:50.130
the absolute value
of the output.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.880
Well, that's less than or
equal to the absolute value

00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:01.220
of this convolution
expression, which

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.640
is in turn less than-- well,
it's equal to that, right?

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.955
It's equal to that, but it's
less than or equal to this.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.440
Absolute value of
a sum is less than

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.600
or equal to the sum of
the absolute values.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.020
And that's less than
or equal to capital M--

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:30.320
this is the max value
that we allowed up there--

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.950
times summation hm.

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:39.540
So this whole thing is finite.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.635
So basically, you
can bound the output.

00:07:41.635 --> 00:07:43.010
You can guarantee
that the output

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:46.860
is bounded provided these
two conditions are satisfied.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.100
So this is actually a very
important pair of conditions.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.535
It's one that we encounter
all the time and in practice.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.580
And because of this
result, we actually

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.550
refer to an LTI
system that satisfies

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:04.370
this absolute
solvability condition.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:18.300
We say that the LTI
system is bounded

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.950
input, bounded output stable--

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.450
bounded input,
bounded output stable.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.770
And I've run out of space
from my stable there.

00:08:43.275 --> 00:08:45.400
So if somebody tells you
they have a bounded input,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.580
bounded output stable system,
if we're talking about an LTI

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:53.390
system, what they mean is that
that condition is satisfied.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:57.520
So that's an
important condition.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:01.390
OK, I have all that on a slide.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:09.480
But if I race it past you on a
slide, then it's hard to track.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.320
But this is something
that we want to do.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:16.470
So for instance, if I had an
LTI system whose unit sample

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:20.040
response was the following--

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:29.940
let's say it's 0 for all times
up to and including time 0,

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:41.160
and then it takes the value
1 over n, from then on, OK?

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.060
So let's see, one
way to write this

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.980
is 1 over n u of n minus 1.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:55.990
If I tell you that
the h of n is this,

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:59.470
that automatically takes care
of zeroing out everything

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:03.310
from 0 backwards, and then
putting in 1 over n from then

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:04.210
on.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:07.840
So is that BIBO stable system--

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.630
bounded input,
bounded output stable?

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.250
Yes?

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.450
How many think yes?

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.060
You'd like to think it's
stable, because a unit sample

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.350
response is decaying.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:23.160
But actually, it doesn't
satisfy the absolute solvability

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.090
condition.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:27.060
The sum of 1 over n
from 1 to infinity is--

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.350
it actually blows up.

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.670
It doesn't converge.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.450
If it falls off any
faster than that,

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:33.750
then you're in good shape.

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.610
But this is actually bad.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:40.390
If you had something that
was 1 over n squared--

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:45.330
OK, so this is not BIBO stable.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.890
But if you had 1 over n
squared u of n minus 1,

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.270
it is BIBO stable.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:59.820
If you had, let's say, 1/3
to the n u of n minus-- well,

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:04.770
we'll say u of n,
that's BIBO stable.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.780
So this falls off
as 1 over n squared.

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.060
That's fast enough for
the sum to converge.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.790
This falls off
exponentially faster.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.480
It's as a geometric series.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.530
It's a discrete
time exponential.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:15.750
So that's fast enough.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.160
So that's also BIBO stable.

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:23.190
All right, so this
is time domain.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.270
We know how to analyze
any LTI system with this.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.180
You tell me what the
unit sample response is

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:34.510
and I can tell you what the
output is for any given input.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.980
But this would be a nightmare if
we had to do design with this,

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.776
because convolution is not--

00:11:40.776 --> 00:11:43.390
it's simple enough to implement
for a particular case,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:46.200
but it's not a simple
operation to think in terms of.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.620
The reason is that the
output at any one time

00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.640
is obtained by scrambling
all the inputs for all time,

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:57.177
combining them in this
weighted linear fashion.

00:11:57.177 --> 00:11:59.010
And then, if you move
to the next time step,

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:01.902
you're again scrambling all the
inputs, but with the weights

00:12:01.902 --> 00:12:03.360
shifted a little
bit, so you've got

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.340
to start from scratch again.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:09.300
So it's very hard to know
what you can say in general

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.410
using the time domain.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:12.480
It's not clear at
all how you'll do

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:17.440
design, for instance, of filters
to filter out noise and so on.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.880
So this is actually--

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.800
it's important.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.620
It's a full characterisation
of LTI systems.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.210
But if we had to
stop there, it's

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:28.080
a fair bet that we wouldn't
be anywhere near where

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.180
we are for engineered
systems, certainly

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:32.340
not in digital communication.

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:37.950
So the key thing is
actually to start thinking

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.650
in terms of frequencies.

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:42.150
So we're going to
look-- we're going

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.400
to spend the next
several lectures looking

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.410
at the frequency domain.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.770
And so what is the
frequency domain?

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:53.160
Well, we're going to be
focusing, essentially,

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:57.300
on sinusoidal inputs and inputs
that are related to them.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:00.780
But let me actually just start
back with something simpler.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.787
Here's my question.

00:13:13.787 --> 00:13:15.870
And I hope the answer isn't
already on the slides.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.440
Maybe it is.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.830
Is it true that if my input
was periodic-- so for instance,

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.930
if I had an input that,
let's say, did this,

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:33.450
it ramped up over
maybe four time steps,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.260
and then started again,
ramping up over 4 times steps,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.172
and continued that indefinitely.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.850
So here's my x of n.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.100
It's an x of n that has
some basic period that

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.110
then repeats periodically.

00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:53.430
So it satisfies
that condition xn

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:58.320
equals xn plus capital P
for some number capital P

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.070
that's the period.

00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:00.600
What is capital P in this case?

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:04.890
4?

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.570
OK.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:12.370
So every 4, this repeats.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.940
Is it true that if I had a
periodic input to an LTI system

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.630
that I'll get a periodic output?

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.220
Any reason I should expect that?

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:26.090
Yeah?

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:27.435
AUDIENCE: Depends on the system.

00:14:27.435 --> 00:14:29.060
PROFESSOR: Could you
speak up a little?

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.440
AUDIENCE: It depends
on the system.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.320
PROFESSOR: It depends
on the system.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:33.180
I'm telling you it's
LTI but nothing more.

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:36.110
So it depends on which
particular LTI system?

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.490
That would be my intuition, too.

00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.100
Yeah?

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.230
AUDIENCE: Just like
in the piece that it

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.025
can average over a long
enough time sample,

00:14:45.025 --> 00:14:47.340
to where it would be constant.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.600
So I'm assuming it's constant.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.310
PROFESSOR: Well, but
that's an average.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:51.060
That's one number.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.520
What I'm asking you is could
this output as a function

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.200
of time also be periodic?

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.470
Can you guarantee it?

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.970
Yeah?

00:14:56.970 --> 00:15:00.358
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:05.793 --> 00:15:07.460
PROFESSOR: I'm not
exactly understanding

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.210
your prescription.

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:11.600
So are you telling me how
to prove that yn equals

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.510
yn plus something for all n?

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.620
AUDIENCE: If we
choose enough-- if we

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:22.500
take enough x's can
we make y constant?

00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.270
PROFESSOR: According to this--

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:27.160
well, I raised the
convolution expression.

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:29.460
But the convolution
expression requires

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:33.090
us to take x's from minus
infinity to plus infinity.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.430
In general, the output at time
n depends on all the inputs.

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:39.060
So it's not clear how
you can block things off.

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:40.380
You had another idea?

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:50.410
AUDIENCE: Well, because it's
time invariant, [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.630
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:54.610
This is a time
invariant system, right?

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:58.180
So if I shifted the
input by capital P,

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:01.060
the output should also
get shifted by capital P.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.590
But shifting the
input by capital

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:05.030
P gives me the same
input back again.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.270
So the response that I
get for that shifted input

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:09.280
must be the old
response that I had,

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.810
which tells me that
the output also

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:13.450
has the property that if
I shifted by capital P,

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.430
I'd get the same thing again.

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:21.640
So this is guaranteed
to be period capital P.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.160
Now, actually there's
a little twist to that.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.160
Because we usually
think of the period

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.940
as being the smallest interval
for which you can repeat.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:34.100
It's conceivable that this
output has a smaller interval,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.670
and therefore that the
period is some integer

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.560
fraction of this capital P.
But this is the general idea.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:42.730
So you see that just knowing
that the system is LTI,

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:44.770
you can already tell
a lot about what

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:47.980
the response will look like.

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.230
One of our favorite
periodic inputs--

00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:53.920
well, if I asked
you to tell me what

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:56.110
your favorite periodic
input is, what might it be?

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:00.508
Any-- sorry?

00:17:00.508 --> 00:17:01.550
AUDIENCE: Constant input?

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.717
PROFESSOR: Constant is good.

00:17:02.717 --> 00:17:04.730
That's periodic.

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:07.400
A little less trivial
than constant?

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.780
PROFESSOR: Sinusoid, right?

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.680
So here's the nice
thing about sinusoids.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.589
It turns out, for an LTI
system, if I put in a sinusoid,

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:19.040
not only is the output
periodic with the same period.

00:17:19.040 --> 00:17:20.720
It's also a sinusoid.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:24.710
So that's an even
greater restriction here.

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.700
You see, in this
particular case,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.069
I have an input that's periodic.

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.527
I'm guaranteed the output is
periodic with the same period.

00:17:30.527 --> 00:17:32.090
But the actual shape
of the waveform

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.260
can be all messed
up relative to this.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.940
It may have no obvious
visual relationship to this.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.670
But if you have a
sinusoidal input,

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:49.580
then it turns out
that more is true.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:55.190
So it turns out, if you put a
sinusoid in, what you get out

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:57.800
is a sinusoid of
the same frequency.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.880
What might change is the
amplitude of the sinusoid

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.590
and the phase angle
on the sinusoid.

00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.930
But it'll be the same frequency
sinusoid that comes out.

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:10.880
So that's a fairly
dramatic restriction.

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.820
And that's actually key to
frequency domain methods.

00:18:13.820 --> 00:18:17.930
What it means is we can focus
on what an LTI system does

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.330
one frequency at a time.

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:22.940
I'll look to see how it
behaves when I excite it with

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.610
a particular value of
this big omega here--

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:27.890
that's the frequency--

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:28.970
look at the response.

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:31.410
I know the response will be
exactly at that frequency.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.250
So all I have to capture is
how much did this input get

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.450
scaled by--

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:37.760
in other words, how much did
the amplitude change by--

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:39.720
and how much did the
phase get changed by?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:43.790
I just need to know
the magnitude and phase

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.550
transformation of the
cosine at each frequency.

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:49.430
If I know that, I know
everything about the system.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:50.960
And it decouples my design.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:53.120
It allows me to think
frequency by frequency when

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.170
I design with an LTI system.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:59.180
So this is actually a
great simplification.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.790
One other remark I've
made here, by the way,

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.850
it's certainly the case
in continuous time,

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:09.740
if I gave you x of
t equals cosine,

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:16.640
let's say, omega 0 t plus
theta, this is always periodic.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:24.950
This is periodic with period
2 pi over little omega--

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.180
a little omega 0.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:30.830
Because any time I increase t
by an integer multiple of this,

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:32.450
I'm going to get
an integer multiple

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:34.730
of 2 pi added into the
argument of the cosine.

00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:38.450
So I'll be back where
I started, right?

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.340
So this is always periodic.

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.840
But with a discrete
time sequence,

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.970
you actually have to be
a little more careful.

00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:49.805
We can think of some particular
discrete time sequence.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.100
We refer to the omega and
the continuous time case

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:59.420
as the angular frequency
in radians per second.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:02.945
Here, we're thinking of this
as angular frequency in radians

00:20:02.945 --> 00:20:08.190
per sample, for instance,
because the thing it multiplies

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.690
is n.

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:12.770
But basically, the units
of big omega are angle.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.710
Well it turns out that this
may not be strictly periodic

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.620
in the sense that
shifting it by an integer

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.480
will get you exactly
the same waveform.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.660
And that's all related to
whether this frequency--

00:20:26.595 --> 00:20:28.167
whether 2 pi over
omega-- the thing

00:20:28.167 --> 00:20:30.500
that you would like to compute
as a period-- is rational

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.580
or not.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:35.030
It turns out, if 2 pi over
big omega is rational,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.700
then the period is the
numerator of that rational.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:40.910
But otherwise,
it's not rational.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.190
But you can think of it
as being samples taken

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.840
from some periodic quantity.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.297
So there's an underlying
time varying--

00:20:50.297 --> 00:20:52.130
sorry, there's an
underlying continuous time

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.060
periodic waveform.

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.470
And you take samples of it.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:58.700
And depending on the frequency
of the underlying sinusoid,

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:01.670
the sequence of samples
may be exactly periodic,

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.350
or may be close
to it in the sense

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:06.830
that they're samples taken
from a periodic signal.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:10.640
In either case, actually, we
tend to not fuss about that.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.310
We'll talk about a cosine like
this as a sinusoid of frequency

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:21.140
omega radians per sample, and
we'll talk about the period

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.450
as being 2 pi over
omega even when

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.010
it's not strictly periodic.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.010
So 2 pi over omega is
our notion of period.

00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:37.265
So a couple of examples
here, you can--

00:21:37.265 --> 00:21:39.390
I'll leave you to look
through those on the slides.

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.435
But you can easily construct
examples where 2 pi over omega

00:21:42.435 --> 00:21:44.790
is rational, and draw a
picture, and convince yourself

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:46.830
that it's actually periodic.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.490
So in this case, for
instance, if big omega--

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:53.520
big omega is whatever
multiplies n,

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.440
so it's going to be 3 pi over 4.

00:21:58.380 --> 00:22:00.240
3 pi over 4 is big omega.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:08.890
So now, I need to look
at 2 pi over omega.

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.970
And so that's equal to 8 over 3.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.520
The numerator of that
is what the period is.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.750
So if you were to
actually sketch this out,

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:19.890
you would find that every
8 samples, it repeats.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:22.420
Whereas, if you look
at this example,

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.440
the thing that multiplies
in is 3 over 4.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:32.670
So now, the period 2 pi over
omega is 2 pi over 3 over 4.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:38.250
So now we're talking
about 8 pi over 3.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.810
That's not rational.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.420
You're not going to get
a periodic sequence.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.220
But we still refer
to 8 pi over 3

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.830
as the period of this
discrete time signal, OK?

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.460
Just because it comes from
sampling an underlying

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.335
continuous time periodic signal.

00:22:52.335 --> 00:22:53.460
All right, that's a detail.

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:56.460
I just don't want you to
trip up on that later on.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:04.130
So here's the basic statement--
what I said earlier.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.420
If you have an LTI system--

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.060
by the way, I like to
represent this with an h dot,

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.787
so that slipped past there.

00:23:13.787 --> 00:23:15.370
I think I've talked
about this before.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.800
Let me not spend time on it--

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.410
notation, notation.

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:23.830
So if the input is a sinusoid of
some frequency, and amplitude,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.600
and phase, the
output is guaranteed

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.830
to be a sinusoid of the
same frequency, potentially

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:33.670
different amplitude
and different phase.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:36.400
So what I want to do is
establish that for you,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.220
starting with our time domain
characterization, which

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.789
is LTI convolution.

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.920
It turns out,
actually, sinusoids

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:00.110
are not the only things
that have this property.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.570
In fact, it might be good for
me to show you another example,

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:04.070
too.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:16.030
So let me give you another
example of a waveform

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.040
that you can put at the input--

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.010
or signal that you can put in
the input to an LTI system,

00:24:21.010 --> 00:24:25.343
and it comes out the same shape
despite all the convolution.

00:24:25.343 --> 00:24:26.260
So here's the example.

00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.850
Suppose xn is what I think of
as a discrete time exponential.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:36.880
So this is r to the n
for some real number r.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.730
So maybe-- maybe r is 1/2.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:48.800
So this is-- so this is xn.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:58.435
It's a discrete
time exponential.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:09.557
You're used to thinking of
that as a geometric series.

00:25:09.557 --> 00:25:11.640
But when you're talking
about signals and systems,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.060
you like to think of that as
a discrete time exponential.

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.630
It does have an
exponential fall off.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.220
What if that goes
in to this system?

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:28.010
Well, the output is
given by this expression

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.650
always, for an LTI system.

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:37.442
So let's just plug in what x
is, that summation over all m,

00:25:37.442 --> 00:25:41.600
hm, r to the n minus m.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:49.400
I'm just substituting in
this expression for x of n.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:54.350
The n piece of this doesn't
depend on the summation index.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.200
So I can actually
simplify this further.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.250
And here's what I have.

00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:07.360
So look what's happened.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:12.190
I sent in a discrete
time exponential.

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:15.100
And out comes the same
discrete time exponential,

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.070
but scaled by some number.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.930
This is just a number, right?

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:21.910
It's an infinite sum.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:22.750
It's just a number.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.270
It works out to be a number.

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.120
You'll have to look for
conditions under which it's

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:29.290
guaranteed to exist.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:35.320
And certainly, if the
system is BIBO stable, and--

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.250
well, if the system is
causal, and the exponential

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:42.810
is decaying, then this
is guaranteed to exist.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.360
OK, so here's an example
of another kind of signal--

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:47.820
related to the
sinusoid as we'll see--

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.700
that has the property that you
put it through the LTI system.

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.732
Despite all this convolution
stuff that's going on,

00:26:53.732 --> 00:26:55.440
I don't even have to
know what that h is.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.315
I can tell you right
away that what comes out

00:26:57.315 --> 00:26:59.190
is the same
exponential but scaled.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:06.120
So now, we're going
to try and establish

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.460
the property for sinusoids.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.750
And the way to do that--
the efficient way to do that

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:14.820
is actually to work
with exponentials again.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.580
Except they're not exponentials
of the type that I have there.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.367
They're complex exponentials.

00:27:32.455 --> 00:27:34.580
Now, when you learn complex
numbers in high school,

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.160
maybe you thought you wouldn't
have to deal with them again.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.045
And then you came to calculus
and you had complex numbers,

00:27:40.045 --> 00:27:41.420
and you thought
maybe after that,

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:43.070
you don't have to
deal with them again.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.720
So I'm here to tell
you that you're always

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.560
going to have to deal
with complex numbers.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.760
So you have to get
comfortable with them.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.450
So we're talking
about, essentially,

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.220
points in the plane--

00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:02.470
point with a real part
and an imaginary part.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.005
So here's the complex number c.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:08.880
Here's the real part.

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:10.200
Here's the imaginary part.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.910
I never thought I'd
need to define j,

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:20.217
but actually, it turns out that
if not everyone in the room

00:28:20.217 --> 00:28:22.050
is an electrical engineer,
then maybe you're

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:25.200
used to thinking of i as being
the square root of minus 1.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.050
Electrical engineers like
j, because they reserve i

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.290
for currents, right?

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:33.570
So j is the square
root of minus 1

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.500
in all electrical engineering.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:43.590
The key identity that you
need is Euler's identity.

00:28:46.278 --> 00:28:47.820
Let me actually
write it on the board

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:50.250
and leave it there, because
we'll be coming back to it

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.150
multiple times.

00:29:03.658 --> 00:29:05.450
Well, actually I can
have it on this board,

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:06.658
because it's really the same.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.410
It's really this picture.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:17.300
e to the j theta is
some complex number.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:25.400
Its real part is cosine
theta, and its imaginary part

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.700
is sine theta.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.510
That's all that Euler's
identity is saying, right?

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:32.750
Here's a complex number.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.010
Its real part is cosine
theta, its imaginary part

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:38.680
of sine theta.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.380
So what's the magnitude
of e to the j theta?

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.220
Every complex number
has a magnitude.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.260
e to the j theta
has magnitude what?

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:59.060
1.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.270
Because it's cosine squared
plus sine squared, right?

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.370
And the angle of
e to the j theta--

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:11.180
the angle of a complex
number is just the angle

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:15.150
from the real axis
up to this vector.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:16.986
So the angle is?

00:30:16.986 --> 00:30:20.297
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:23.152 --> 00:30:25.110
PROFESSOR: I'm hearing
more complicated answers

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:26.580
than I expected.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:27.580
Theta, right?

00:30:31.048 --> 00:30:31.590
You're right.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.960
It's arctan sine theta over cos
theta, which is theta, right?

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:42.120
All right, so this
is Euler's identity.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.517
And this is really critical.

00:30:45.517 --> 00:30:47.100
And if you can
remember this, then you

00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.260
can remember all sorts
of other identities

00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:53.560
that might trip you
up from time to time.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:02.180
So for instance, let's see,
if I have e to the j theta

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:13.070
1 times e to the j theta 2,
does that simplify to this?

00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:15.220
That's OK, right?

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.450
That's just combining
the exponents.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.910
Well, expand this out
using Euler's identity.

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:22.400
Expand this out using
Euler's identity.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.680
Expand this out using
Euler's identity,

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.250
and you discover, for instance,
that cosine theta 1 plus theta

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:36.650
2 equals cosine theta 1, cosine
theta 2, minus sine theta

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.290
1 sine theta 2.

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:40.910
OK, you know all
these identities.

00:31:40.910 --> 00:31:44.390
But if you're ever pressed to
derive them, the place to start

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:47.270
is Euler's identity.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.580
If you're pressed to
derive Euler's identity,

00:31:49.580 --> 00:31:52.100
then maybe go back
to Taylor series.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.590
But if you want to carry
one thing in your head,

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:55.695
carry Euler's identity.

00:31:55.695 --> 00:31:56.570
All the rest follows.

00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:03.910
All right.

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.638
So here is-- well,
actually, let me

00:32:15.638 --> 00:32:16.930
make that point a little later.

00:32:21.370 --> 00:32:23.010
These are easy.

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:25.830
e to the j0 is just--

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.440
this unit length vector
line along the real axis

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:30.330
is just the number 1.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.480
e to the j pi, it's
the unit vector lying

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:34.740
along the negative real axis.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.240
So that's the number
minus 1, right?

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.230
So here's how we use complex
exponentials to prove

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.510
the result that I claimed
earlier, namely that sinusoids

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.530
in gives you sinusoids out.

00:32:58.530 --> 00:33:00.370
A sinusoid of a
given frequency in

00:33:00.370 --> 00:33:02.440
gives you a sinusoid of
the same frequency out.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.170
What we're going to
do is actually combine

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:08.630
sines and cosines
into one calculation.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:10.630
This may look a little
funny, because now, we're

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:15.810
suddenly putting a complex
input into this LTI system.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.088
But if you think about the
math that we did for LTI,

00:33:18.088 --> 00:33:19.630
it didn't really
care whether we were

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.920
feeding in real numbers
or complex numbers.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.040
So we could have
a signal that has

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.680
a real part and a complex
part at each time.

00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:28.840
Convolution would work
exactly the same way.

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.320
We arrived at convolution
through linearity and time

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.680
invariance arguments, and all
those work for complex signals.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.910
So we could actually be putting
in a signal of this type

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.470
and seeing what comes out.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.980
Well, this is very close to
the calculation we did earlier

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.020
with a real exponential.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:51.460
The only difference now is
it's a complex exponential.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:52.750
But here's the computation.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.630
We start, as always, with the
time domain representation.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.250
That's convolution.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.630
Substitute in for
x of n minus m.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.260
x of n is this signal here.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.060
I should have
labeled it as x of n.

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:11.092
So just stick x
of n minus m here.

00:34:11.092 --> 00:34:12.550
And then, you
discover that there's

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:14.967
a part of this that doesn't
depend on the summation index.

00:34:14.967 --> 00:34:16.540
So you pull that out.

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.170
So you're left with this
summation inside and this piece

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:21.389
out.

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:22.389
So look what's happened.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:26.699
You've put in a
complex exponential.

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:30.920
And out comes the same
complex exponential

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.290
scaled by something.

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.699
What is this
complex exponential?

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:39.080
Well, its real part
is a cosine signal,

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.960
and the imaginary part is
a sine signal, all right?

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:50.110
So this object is something that
we'll encounter and use a lot.

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:51.639
It's referred to
as the frequency

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:53.650
response of the system.

00:34:53.650 --> 00:34:57.350
You've heard the term used,
undoubtedly, in other settings.

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.900
But here's the definition.

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.540
It's a function
only of big omega.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.540
Because once you've
summed over m--

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:09.990
little m-- everything
else has gone away.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:12.040
So only depends on big omega.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:12.970
And here's what it is.

00:35:12.970 --> 00:35:22.070
It's the summation over
all values of m, h of m,

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:24.490
e to the minus j omega m.

00:35:27.055 --> 00:35:28.305
That's the frequency response.

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.730
So if you give me the unit
sample response of a system,

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:43.750
I can find for you what
the frequency response is.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:50.440
So let's actually do an example.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:50.940
Let's see.

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:53.412
Let's take one of your--

00:35:53.412 --> 00:35:55.620
let's take an averaging
filter that you've looked at.

00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:12.330
To make it easy on you, I'll
sketch it as a function of m.

00:36:12.330 --> 00:36:14.440
It doesn't matter
what that's called.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.880
So here's 1/3, 1/3 1/3.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:27.330
We've come to recognize this as
B unit-sample response of a 3

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.030
point averaging filter.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:39.120
It's a causal 3 point averaging.

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:49.780
So what's the frequency
response of this system?

00:36:49.780 --> 00:36:53.070
Well, it's h of big omega.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:55.770
And then I just follow
this prescription.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:58.200
So the only values of h
that are non-0 are for m

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.180
equals 0, 1, and 2.

00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:06.690
So it's going to be 1/3, 1
plus e to the minus j omega,

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:10.590
plus e to the minus j2 omega.

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:12.780
And I'm done, right?

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.500
Now, to actually get a feel
for this what you want to do

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.950
is write it in different forms.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.940
For instance, a very
useful way to write this

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:29.130
is in terms of the
magnitude and the angle.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:34.980
So here's a way to represent
any complex number.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.010
This is a complex number, right?

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:41.560
I can write it as magnitude
times e to the j angle.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:45.780
So that will actually turn out
to be a much more efficient way

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:47.500
to think about
frequency responses.

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:55.140
This is the magnitude of
the frequency response.

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.450
And this is the phase.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:15.210
So how does that bring us
back to sines and cosines?

00:38:21.757 --> 00:38:23.840
Let me actually go a little
bit out of order here,

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:33.071
and here's the basic statement.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.970
From the result that
we have up there--

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.360
and I'll show you on the
next slide how to derive it--

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:47.090
what you can show is that if you
put a cosine into the system,

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.850
what comes out is the same
cosine, except its amplitude is

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.670
scaled by the magnitude
of the frequency response,

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:55.640
and the phase angle is increased
by the angle of the frequency

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.960
response.

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.020
So this is really--

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:00.603
if you know this as a
function of frequency--

00:39:00.603 --> 00:39:03.020
if you know the magnitude and
phase angle of the frequency

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:04.910
response as a
function of frequency,

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:10.260
you can describe the response of
the system to any cosine input.

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.660
What if the cosine was a
little more complicated

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.100
than the one there?

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:29.180
Suppose I had-- suppose I
had cosine omega 0 n plus,

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.970
let's say, pi over 4 going in.

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:33.683
What comes out?

00:39:33.683 --> 00:39:34.850
What do you think comes out?

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.350
Anyone?

00:39:44.350 --> 00:39:46.150
I showed you a
particular case here.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.120
How much new work would you
have to do if it was actually

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.410
a slightly shifted cosine?

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.280
Take a guess.

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.280
Yeah?

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.680
AUDIENCE: Just replace n in the
output with n plus pi over 4.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you just change this

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:05.260
by adding in an extra pi over 4.

00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.243
So what comes out--

00:40:06.243 --> 00:40:07.410
that's what you said, right?

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:08.357
Is that what you said?

00:40:08.357 --> 00:40:09.640
OK.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:12.490
Sometimes I'm guessing because
I don't hear that well.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.710
So here's plus the
angle, and then

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:23.503
plus the additional pi over 4.

00:40:23.503 --> 00:40:24.920
And this actually
will follow just

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.610
from time and variance
of the system.

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:29.717
So you can actually-- so this
is actually pretty general.

00:40:29.717 --> 00:40:32.300
If you're going to remember one
thing about frequency response

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.420
in terms of what the
operational significance is,

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.848
for instance in a
laboratory experiment,

00:40:37.848 --> 00:40:39.140
this is the result to remember.

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:43.730
This is why frequency
response is important.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.970
And the proof, very easy.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:49.550
Once you have the basic result
with exponential inputs,

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:50.300
the proof is easy.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.810
Because a cosine can be
written as the sum of these two

00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:56.300
exponentials.

00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:59.030
How do I get that?

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:01.920
Just from Euler's
identity, right?

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.390
Use Euler's identity for each
of these-- for e to the j, e

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:09.620
to the minus j, when
you add Euler's for this

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.000
and Euler's for this, the
sine terms cancel out.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.260
So you get 2 cosine in the
numerator and you divide by 2.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:17.960
So if you're stuck for a
derivation of a result like

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.670
this, go back to Euler's.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.980
So cosine can be
written this way.

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:24.920
So when I feed a
cosine big omega

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.770
0n of the input, what
I'm actually feeding in

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:31.250
is a linear combination
of two exponentials.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:34.820
But I know how to write the
response to an exponential.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.390
If this exponential--
this sum of exponential

00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:41.890
goes in, what comes out is the
corresponding sum of responses.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:47.330
So it will be this exponential
times the 1/2 there,

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.700
scaled by the
frequency response.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.690
That's what frequency response
does to an exponential.

00:41:53.690 --> 00:41:57.050
And this exponential
comes out the same,

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:59.450
but scaled by the frequency
response-- evaluated

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:02.780
at the frequency of
that exponential.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:09.780
So maybe you've-- you're having
trouble visualizing the result

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.740
that I'm invoking.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:12.840
But it's the one
that we just proved.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:21.135
If you have e to the ae
to the j omega n going in,

00:42:21.135 --> 00:42:23.010
let's say, at some
particular frequency omega

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:32.400
0 to a system with frequency
response h of omega, what

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:37.140
comes out is the same
exponential that went in,

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:42.270
scaled by the frequency response
evaluated at the frequency

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:43.740
that we're talking
about-- omega 0.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.850
So when I label the system
with the frequency response,

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:52.070
this is a general omega.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:55.520
But the value of it that I'm
interested in is the value of--

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.770
at the frequency of the inputs.

00:42:57.770 --> 00:43:02.480
So if the input is e to the
j omega 0n, what comes out

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.490
is that same e to
the j omega 0n,

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:07.290
but scaled by the frequency
response at that frequency.

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:10.760
So that's what
I'm invoking here.

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:13.760
Invoking it twice, well,
this is just the real part

00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.460
of this quantity, because
it's a complex number

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.690
and its complex
conjugate, and so on.

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.830
So you put it all together,
and you actually very directly

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:23.190
have this result.

00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:26.570
So we're using complex
inputs as just a trick

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:28.670
for getting the results
that we'd really

00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:31.190
like to get for real inputs.

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:34.100
If you didn't want to do
that, you could actually just

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.890
put in the cosine omega 0n, and
crank it all the way through,

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:37.850
and you would get it.

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:46.790
So you could say yn equals
summation over all m, h of m.

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.160
Then we have x of n
minus m here, right?

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:57.120
So it's going to be cosine
omega 0, n minus m going in.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.110
And now, use appropriate
algebraic identities and you'll

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:01.410
get the same result.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:04.790
So we didn't have to use
complex exponential inputs

00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:07.640
to get the result. It's just a
convenient way of getting it.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:11.300
Again, if you're going to
carry one result in your head

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:13.850
in the complex case,
this is the one to carry.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:14.660
It is very simple.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:18.240
It says complex exponential in,
you get the same exponential

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:18.740
out.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:28.640
So let's play a little more
with this particular filter

00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:31.640
since we see that magnitude
and angle are so important.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.750
We're talking-- we're back to
this 3 point averaging, right?

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:46.040
Here's the frequency response.

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.920
And I'd like to get
the magnitude out.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.140
And you could certainly
use Euler's identity

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.600
on each of these pieces,
group all the real parts, all

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.520
the imaginary parts, and so on.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.890
It ends up actually
being a bit of a mess

00:44:57.890 --> 00:45:00.740
to try and write down cleanly.

00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:04.330
So let me show you a trick that
works for this kind of thing.

00:45:12.667 --> 00:45:14.500
And it'll give you some
practice in thinking

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:16.150
about these complex
exponentials.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:25.560
Do you agree that I've just
rewritten the same thing

00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.760
as I had above?

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:33.890
OK, does this simplify?

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.108
Can you write it
as something real?

00:45:43.108 --> 00:45:45.650
We've got a complex quantity
and its complex conjugate there,

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:49.310
so we should be able to
collapse them into real, right?

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.220
The way you recognize a complex
conjugate is that the j has

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:55.630
gone to a minus j.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.930
So what is this whole thing?

00:45:58.930 --> 00:45:59.872
Somebody?

00:45:59.872 --> 00:46:01.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:02.650
PROFESSOR: Where
did that come from?

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:03.620
Can I have a hand, just--?

00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.120
Oh, yeah.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:15.220
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so let's say
1 plus 2 cosine omega, right?

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.910
So that's simplified nicely.

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:26.338
OK, so are we in a position to
say what the magnitude of h is?

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.560
I've got an h that
is represented

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:37.600
as the product of this.

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.950
Oh, by the way, sorry, I--

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:42.310
this should just be
a 3 here, not a 1/3.

00:46:42.310 --> 00:46:44.350
Everyone shook their
head in agreement

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:45.610
when I wrote that down, but--

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:51.382
what's the magnitude of the
product of two complex numbers?

00:46:51.382 --> 00:46:53.090
Is it the product of
the individual ones?

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.875
The magnitude of
h is going to be,

00:46:57.875 --> 00:47:05.910
let's see 1/3 magnitude e
minus j omega times magnitude

00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:09.420
1 plus 2 cosine omega, right?

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.140
The magnitude of a
product of complex numbers

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.420
is just the product of
the individual magnitudes.

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:20.090
What's the magnitude of this?

00:47:20.090 --> 00:47:21.080
1.

00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:22.140
So we're actually done.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.080
We actually have a
very simple expression

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:29.030
for the magnitude of
the frequency response

00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:31.310
of this moving average filter.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:32.550
That's all it is.

00:47:32.550 --> 00:47:34.190
Oh, sorry, I need
the absolute value.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.650
So let's see, I
think I have that

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:40.880
sketched out in one of these.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:50.060
I actually have three moving
average filters drawn out here.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:52.910
The one that I've just
worked out is this case.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.210
This is the 3 point
moving average filter--

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:58.970
a height of 1/3
for each of these

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:02.210
at 0, 1, and 2, and
everything else is 0.

00:48:02.210 --> 00:48:04.848
Here is the frequency
response magnitude.

00:48:04.848 --> 00:48:07.390
The notation that's used on the
figure is slightly different.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:13.220
So some people, including me
in the next course I teach,

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:16.520
will write the
frequency response

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.380
as this instead of h of omega.

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.560
But that's really
unnecessarily fussy.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.170
It's important when you're
talking about z transforms

00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:25.670
at the same time
that you're talking

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:26.720
about Fourier transforms.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.080
But for us, it's not important.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.830
So you'll see slightly different
notation, probably in the notes

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:31.940
as well.

00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:34.790
But just think of that
as just h of omega.

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.820
So here's the filter
we were talking about.

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:41.720
Here, supposedly, is the
frequency response magnitude.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:46.280
What we should be seeing is
the magnitude of this quantity.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:48.800
And let me see if
you believe it.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:53.760
So what we have is--

00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:08.580
so what I have is,
at omega equals 0,

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:12.080
I've got something
that starts at 1.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:18.680
And then, when I get
out to minus pi over pi,

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:21.470
this has come down to
the value minus 1/3.

00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:23.210
And so this is what I have for--

00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.200
this is the quantity
within the absolute sine,

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.730
before I take an absolute value.

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:37.060
And when I take the absolute
value, this flips over.

00:49:40.212 --> 00:49:41.920
And that's really what
you're looking at.

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.720
You're looking at frequency
response magnitude,

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.090
which is this.

00:49:50.075 --> 00:49:52.200
And you've got to figure
out the phase accordingly.

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.050
And that I'll leave you
to do in recitation.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.120
But I want to ask
you one last thing.

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:59.820
Why do I not bother
to plot the frequency

00:49:59.820 --> 00:50:03.342
response beyond minus pi to pi?

00:50:03.342 --> 00:50:08.090
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:13.220
PROFESSOR: So the reason is that
the frequency response tells us

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:18.470
what the response is to
inputs of this type, right?

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:20.630
The frequency response
says if this goes in,

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.390
how much it gets scaled
by when it comes out.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:30.360
Well, if I increase omega 0 by
an integer multiple of 2 pi,

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.200
I get the same
exponential back again.

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:37.160
So there's no new information
outside of minus pi to pi.

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:42.190
Another way to think
of it is we're really

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:47.710
talking about complex
numbers and their angles.

00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:50.410
Once you've made a full
circle from minus pi to pi,

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:53.020
there's no new space to cover.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:54.790
So you'll see frequency
response is only

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:56.890
plotted from minus pi to pi.

00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:58.630
All the interesting
action is there.

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:00.255
All right, we'll
develop more intuition

00:51:00.255 --> 00:51:04.290
for this in recitation and in
the next couple of lectures.

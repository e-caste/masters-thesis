00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.260 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So take a
look at the reading list.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.570 align:middle line:84%
And you will see there's
various things that

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.440 align:middle line:84%
are starred on there that
are on today's lecture two.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.060 align:middle line:84%
There's readings by Kreps
and by Nicholson and Snyder.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.580 align:middle line:84%
The lecture does not
overlap entirely,

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.070 align:middle line:84%
but it is close
in many respects.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.360 align:middle line:90%
So I urge you to take a look at.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.940 align:middle line:84%
There's one Kreps and
two Nicholson and Snyder.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.870 align:middle line:84%
I also mentioned last time, but
it might have been abstract,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.520 align:middle line:90%
the review sheets.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.880 align:middle line:84%
This is lecture
one from last time.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.200 align:middle line:90%
It's a review sheet--

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.940 align:middle line:84%
pretty comprehensive,
but also quite specific.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.890 align:middle line:84%
So you should be
looking at these things

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.890 align:middle line:84%
before, during, or
especially after the lecture,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.410 align:middle line:84%
even if you think you
understand the material.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.880 align:middle line:90%
Take a hand at this.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.810 align:middle line:84%
I certainly have included
questions almost verbatim

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.260 align:middle line:84%
like this on the midterms,
so you might as well do it

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.680 align:middle line:90%
in advance.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.280 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to read out
just one or two of these.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.800 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, we don't have
time to do too many of them.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.610 align:middle line:84%
I would say I'm almost picking
at random, but not quite.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.590 align:middle line:84%
So the fact that I pick
some and not others

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.020 align:middle line:84%
does not mean that some are
more important than others,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.730 align:middle line:84%
but only I want to
practice with you.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.000 align:middle line:90%
So for example, this one--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.790 align:middle line:84%
Angrist distinguishes
randomized trials

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.180 align:middle line:84%
from quasi-experiments
or natural experiments.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.180 align:middle line:84%
Please explain what he
means by this distinction

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.550 align:middle line:84%
and give one example from
each of the two groups,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.220 align:middle line:84%
meaning from quasi-randomized
controlled trials and one

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.040 align:middle line:90%
from quasi-experiments.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.592 align:middle line:84%
I know you're new to this,
so I hesitate to call on you.

00:01:57.592 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:84%
So it would be
wonderful if someone

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.992 align:middle line:84%
were to volunteer to
answer this question.

00:02:01.992 --> 00:02:03.700 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: I think I
could make a go at it.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.740 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: All
right, please go ahead.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.120 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: Oh, yeah, so an
actual experiment is randomized

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.700 align:middle line:84%
controlled trials where
you actually randomly take

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.140 align:middle line:84%
a group of people,
randomly select

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.723 align:middle line:84%
some to be a control group, some
to be the experimental group.

00:02:16.723 --> 00:02:21.550 align:middle line:84%
And then you apply some
change to one of them,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.960 align:middle line:84%
to the experimental group,
and track the outcomes.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.270 align:middle line:84%
A natural quasi-experiment would
be more if something happens--

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.210 align:middle line:84%
for example, one state raises
the minimum wage and another

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.110 align:middle line:90%
state doesn't.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.190 align:middle line:90%
And you can track a difference.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
So it wasn't an actual
experiment, but you can still--

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.020 align:middle line:84%
but it sort of behaves a
bit like an experiment.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.740 align:middle line:84%
So you can try to tease
apart the causality there.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.260 align:middle line:84%
And then I can't remember
the rest of the question.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.010 align:middle line:90%
Sorry.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.302 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No, it's fine.

00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:56.062 align:middle line:84%
Do you remember an
example from any of those?

00:02:56.062 --> 00:02:57.520 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: From a
natural experiment,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.395 align:middle line:84%
that would be like the
Moving to Opportunity.

00:02:59.395 --> 00:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
I remember that being mentioned,
where people were effectively

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.950 align:middle line:84%
randomly chosen to be given
housing opportunities to move.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.225 align:middle line:90%
And then that was tracked.

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:11.350 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Excellent.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.500 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.680 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, and the other
RCT we did was

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.480 align:middle line:84%
the paying bicycle messengers
temporarily higher wages.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.170 align:middle line:84%
RCTs are where we are
with these vaccines,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.990 align:middle line:84%
just to have an obvious
analog to the widely used RCTs

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.520 align:middle line:90%
in medical trials.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.240 align:middle line:84%
But we like to frame
questions that way.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.470 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, Charles.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And I also went and
read some of the things

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.790 align:middle line:90%
you recommended last time.

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.580 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's see, let me
pick another one.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.180 align:middle line:84%
So Varian speaks of big data as
consisting of machine learning

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.830 align:middle line:90%
and data science.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:54.250 align:middle line:84%
What do those
techniques accomplish

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.350 align:middle line:84%
and what do they
fail to accomplish?

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.763 align:middle line:84%
And again, let me
ask for volunteers.

00:03:59.763 --> 00:04:01.180 align:middle line:84%
STUDENT: So I
remember you talking

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.280 align:middle line:84%
about what they
fail to accomplish,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.600 align:middle line:84%
where it's difficult
to actually construct

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.020 align:middle line:84%
the explanation behind the
phenomena that you observe.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.480 align:middle line:84%
Instead, it just gives
you good predictive power

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.490 align:middle line:84%
where you can construct
accurate models,

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.160 align:middle line:84%
but not necessarily
explain them.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.690 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Excellent.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.760 align:middle line:90%
That's exactly right.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.330 align:middle line:84%
The example was just
because we see more police

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.880 align:middle line:84%
in the community, that
doesn't mean it causes crime.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.060 align:middle line:84%
And I said something about
the example's a bit more

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.680 align:middle line:84%
problematic these days than
it was when Varian used that

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.520 align:middle line:90%
as an example.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.850 align:middle line:84%
But it's still the case that
we need to out the causality

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:45.620 align:middle line:84%
whether it runs from crime
to police or police to crime.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.100 align:middle line:84%
All right, so there are other
important questions in here,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
but I'm a little leery
about taking too, too

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.550 align:middle line:90%
much of the lecture time.

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.970 align:middle line:84%
So these are called
review sheets.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.600 align:middle line:84%
And I think you'll
find it is not hard.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.780 align:middle line:84%
It really is just a matter of
keeping up with the lecture

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.870 align:middle line:84%
and thinking about
this afterwards, along

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.340 align:middle line:90%
with those starred readings.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.960 align:middle line:84%
So today, this is
about consumer choice.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.150 align:middle line:84%
Remember, we're
studying economies,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.290 align:middle line:84%
but we need to build and
analyze the building blocks, one

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.620 align:middle line:90%
of which is consumer behavior.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.170 align:middle line:84%
So that's what this
lecture is about.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:28.220 align:middle line:84%
The whole economy consists of
consumers with preferences,

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.620 align:middle line:84%
and endowments, and
consumption sets,

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.570 align:middle line:90%
and firms with technology.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.790 align:middle line:84%
We're going to focus on consumer
choice over possible bundles

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.670 align:middle line:90%
they might want to buy or eat.

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:44.300 align:middle line:84%
We're going to describe some
assumptions that characterize

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.810 align:middle line:84%
what's known as rational, as
opposed to irrational consumer

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.110 align:middle line:90%
choice.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.580 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go
to this application, which

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.290 align:middle line:84%
is maximizing utility
for a given budget.

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.600 align:middle line:84%
Let me just say now,
because I may not

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.400 align:middle line:84%
remember to do it
later, when we get

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.370 align:middle line:84%
to this application
of maximizing utility

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.690 align:middle line:84%
subject to a budget, it's what
we call "partial equilibrium."

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.560 align:middle line:84%
We take, as Matzkin
would say, some things

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.530 align:middle line:84%
as exogenous to the
consumer choice--

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.520 align:middle line:84%
namely, their income and
the prices that they face.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.350 align:middle line:90%
Those are like data or givens.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.370 align:middle line:84%
And then we're looking at what
they choose to buy or to eat.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.172 align:middle line:84%
It's partial
equilibrium in the sense

00:06:27.172 --> 00:06:29.630 align:middle line:84%
that we're not trying to explain
where the prices come from

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.260 align:middle line:90%
or where the income comes from.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.720 align:middle line:84%
But when we put
this building block

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.860 align:middle line:84%
together with the other ones,
with other households and/or

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.290 align:middle line:84%
with firms, then
we'll have what's

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.600 align:middle line:84%
called "general
equilibrium," which

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.690 align:middle line:84%
is the endogenous determination
of prices, and so on.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:51.660 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's call capital X here
a consumer's consumption set.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.120 align:middle line:84%
Two elements of the set called x
and y are potential consumption

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.110 align:middle line:90%
bundles.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.230 align:middle line:84%
You should be aware
and a bit leery

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.170 align:middle line:84%
that the notation changes
from time to time.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes in the
slides that follow,

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.740 align:middle line:84%
we're about to say x is one
bundle and y is another one.

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Many times we'll
go more abstract,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.070 align:middle line:84%
and talk about a
vector x of dimension n

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:21.030 align:middle line:84%
where they're all
x's, x1 through x n.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:24.360 align:middle line:84%
And indeed, when we start
to talk about more than one

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.090 align:middle line:90%
consumer, like consumer i--

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:28.560 align:middle line:90%
that's his or her name--

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.010 align:middle line:84%
we can talk about the
consumption set x sub i.

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:34.650 align:middle line:84%
The bundle x i is
still a vector,

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:37.020 align:middle line:84%
but it has a little
i subscript in front

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.930 align:middle line:90%
of the 1 to n commodity labels.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.920 align:middle line:84%
But there's no point in
being overly detailed when

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.410 align:middle line:84%
we don't need it, so we'll
drop the i mostly today.

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:48.990 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it
appears anywhere.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.480 align:middle line:84%
And as I said for
the graphs, we're

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.410 align:middle line:84%
going to be using x
and y quite a bit.

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, one warning-- should
have something flashing

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:58.980 align:middle line:90%
on the screen--

00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.760 align:middle line:90%
stop.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.360 align:middle line:84%
Pause-- which is
there's something mind

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.250 align:middle line:90%
numbing about the notation.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.360 align:middle line:90%
It's useful.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.950 align:middle line:84%
We will build up all
the tools with it.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.560 align:middle line:84%
But we'll lose sight
of the applications.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.090 align:middle line:84%
So I will bend over backwards
to pop in a slide here or there

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:18.060 align:middle line:84%
and say some words about
how this can be used.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.240 align:middle line:84%
But the point,
although abstract now,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.180 align:middle line:84%
is that the artillery where
you're going to create

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.650 align:middle line:84%
applies to wheat and rice, but
it also applies to locations.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.260 align:middle line:90%
It applies to dates and time.

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.510 align:middle line:84%
It applies to shocks
and states of the world.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.679 align:middle line:84%
So once we do it one way
with this powerful but boring

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:42.179 align:middle line:84%
notation, we can use it in
many actual applications

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:43.080 align:middle line:90%
and villages.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:46.020 align:middle line:84%
With the exception that here,
we're actually spelling out

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.160 align:middle line:90%
the consumption set.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.880 align:middle line:90%
So you can see that.

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:84%
Can you see it when I'm
moving the cursor around?

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.050 align:middle line:84%
All right, I'll have
to work on my tool kit.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:09:00.070 align:middle line:84%
So there's two goods
here-- bread and leisure.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.300 align:middle line:84%
And the consumption
set is all of this.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.770 align:middle line:90%
It has an upper bound.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.820 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.080 align:middle line:84%
Because leisure is
measured in hours,

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.410 align:middle line:84%
and there's no more
than 24 hours, a day.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:15.790 align:middle line:84%
So that's one example
of a consumption set.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Here's another-- there's
two goods, x1 and x2.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:22.330 align:middle line:90%
x1 can take on any value--

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.720 align:middle line:84%
integers, rational, or
irrational numbers from 0

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.920 align:middle line:90%
to infinity.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.280 align:middle line:84%
But x2 takes on
discrete values--

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.930 align:middle line:90%
integers-- 1, 2, 3.

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:35.020 align:middle line:84%
So all these lines,
including the 0 line,

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:37.730 align:middle line:84%
represent elements in
the consumption set.

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Here's an example with some
limited time and geography.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.420 align:middle line:84%
You can consume a piece of
bread, or bread in general,

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:49.670 align:middle line:84%
in Washington at noon
or in New York at noon.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.430 align:middle line:84%
But you can't be in two
places at the same time.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.360 align:middle line:84%
So in this case, you
have the x and y-axis

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.400 align:middle line:90%
being the consumption set.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.220 align:middle line:90%
And here's a subsistence.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.930 align:middle line:90%
If you don't eat enough--

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.530 align:middle line:84%
and we'll talk about starvation
in medieval villages soon--

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.290 align:middle line:90%
you die.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.660 align:middle line:84%
So you have to have either
four slices of white bread,

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.660 align:middle line:84%
or four slices of brown bread,
or something in between.

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.110 align:middle line:90%
But you can't go less than that.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.370 align:middle line:84%
Those things are not
in the consumption set.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's the set in
which commodity bundles

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:21.550 align:middle line:90%
lie for the house.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.140 align:middle line:90%
So what about their preferences?

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.450 align:middle line:84%
We're going to begin with
this primitive, which

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.790 align:middle line:84%
looks like a weak
inequality, but it's

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:31.330 align:middle line:84%
actually script or squiggly, to
denote that it's a preference

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:33.620 align:middle line:90%
relation, which is an ordering.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:39.160 align:middle line:84%
So if you give me two elements
of the consumption set x and y,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.890 align:middle line:84%
this ordering will
tell me whether x

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:47.530 align:middle line:84%
is weakly preferred or at least
as good as y in the consumer's

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:48.550 align:middle line:90%
ordering.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.450 align:middle line:84%
From that primitive, we can
create strict preference

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:56.200 align:middle line:90%
for any two goods, x and y.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.690 align:middle line:84%
If x is strictly
preferred to y, that

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:01.660 align:middle line:84%
means that x is at
least as good as y,

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.260 align:middle line:84%
but y is not at
least as good as x.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.720 align:middle line:84%
Indifference can
also be constructed

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.100 align:middle line:90%
from this primitive.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.500 align:middle line:84%
Namely, if x is
indifferent to y,

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.920 align:middle line:84%
then x is at least as good as y,
and y is at least as good as x.

00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.890 align:middle line:84%
This preference relation then
represents the preferences

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.570 align:middle line:84%
of each individual--
in this case,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:25.700 align:middle line:84%
as I said, we've
deleted individual i.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.120 align:middle line:84%
This would be true
for all of them.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.890 align:middle line:84%
Preference relations
obviously can

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:33.120 align:middle line:84%
be different across
different households.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.190 align:middle line:90%
What do we mean by "rational?"

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:40.590 align:middle line:84%
Rational choice means that
those preferences are complete,

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:42.720 align:middle line:90%
transitive, and continuous.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.810 align:middle line:84%
And let me just go
over them briefly.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:49.110 align:middle line:84%
"Completeness" means that
any two bundles x and y

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:52.380 align:middle line:84%
are ranked relative
to each other.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.950 align:middle line:84%
So given x and y, either x
is strictly preferred to y,

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:58.620 align:middle line:84%
y is strictly preferred
to x, or the household

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.810 align:middle line:90%
is indifferent between the two.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.650 align:middle line:84%
And the point here is that
any two bundles x and y

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:06.990 align:middle line:84%
can be ranked and
compared to each other.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a complete ordering.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.880 align:middle line:84%
Transitive-- if x
is at least as good

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.340 align:middle line:84%
as y, y is at
least as good as z,

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.270 align:middle line:84%
then it must also be true that
x is at least as good as z.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.580 align:middle line:90%
So we will use this later.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.580 align:middle line:84%
It's like an internal
consistency criterion.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:28.230 align:middle line:84%
You may only see choices
between x and y and y and z,

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.270 align:middle line:84%
but if the consumer
is rational, you

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.430 align:middle line:84%
can infer something
about the way

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.290 align:middle line:84%
they would behave
when they're faced

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:36.780 align:middle line:84%
with a choice between x
and z that we actually

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.850 align:middle line:90%
didn't see them make.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.910 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we have
continuity, which intuitively

00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:44.730 align:middle line:84%
means if we have x
strictly preferred to y,

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:48.120 align:middle line:84%
and we have some other
bundle x prime which

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.810 align:middle line:84%
is close to x, since x and x
prime are close to each other

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and x is preferred to
y, then x prime is also

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.875 align:middle line:90%
going to be preferred to y.

00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:58.500 align:middle line:84%
In other words, the
preference ordering

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:02.130 align:middle line:84%
isn't jumping around hugely as
we move around the commodity

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:03.060 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.420 align:middle line:84%
So we start with this
underlying preference ordering,

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:11.040 align:middle line:84%
but we can do a representation
as a utility function

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.350 align:middle line:84%
just by preserving
the rank ordering.

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.990 align:middle line:84%
So for example, if x is
at least as good as y,

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.500 align:middle line:84%
then we come up with
the utility function u,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.180 align:middle line:84%
which maps the
entire consumption

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:23.340 align:middle line:84%
set into real
numbers in such a way

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.770 align:middle line:84%
that we give at least
as high of a number

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:29.410 align:middle line:90%
to x as we assign under u to y.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:34.470 align:middle line:84%
One thing to note is that many
utility functions would work.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.930 align:middle line:84%
If we start with
this primitive, we

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.610 align:middle line:84%
could have 2 times u or some
multiplicative function of u.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.100 align:middle line:84%
It's going to preserve
the ranked utility

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.050 align:middle line:90%
numbers across the bundles.

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.750 align:middle line:84%
So this is referred to
as an ordinal rather than

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.490 align:middle line:90%
a cardinal utility function.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:53.160 align:middle line:84%
In the history of
economics, utility functions

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.510 align:middle line:84%
were invented by Jeremy
Bentham in England.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:01.210 align:middle line:84%
Jeremy left in his will
that after he died,

00:14:01.210 --> 00:14:04.020 align:middle line:84%
he wanted to be
embalmed and preserved,

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:07.170 align:middle line:84%
and that once a year he should
have tea with his friends.

00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:09.945 align:middle line:84%
So Jeremy still-- or at
least when I was last there--

00:14:09.945 --> 00:14:14.970 align:middle line:84%
is sitting in kind of a glass
container in the lobby of one

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:17.910 align:middle line:84%
of the buildings at University
of College of London.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.140 align:middle line:90%
There was some vandalism.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:21.390 align:middle line:84%
Someone removed his
head at one point.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:23.190 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, I always
think of Jeremy

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:25.800 align:middle line:84%
when I think of
utility functions.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.840 align:middle line:84%
And forgive my morbid
sense of humor.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.480 align:middle line:84%
Here's a theorem-- any
preference relation that

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.420 align:middle line:84%
can be represented by a
continuous utility function

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:34.590 align:middle line:90%
is rational.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.930 align:middle line:90%
OK, that's a lot to take in.

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.390 align:middle line:84%
Any preference
relation that can be

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:43.950 align:middle line:84%
represented as a continuous
utility function is rational.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:49.590 align:middle line:84%
Well, "completeness" means
we're assigning utility numbers

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.580 align:middle line:84%
to any bundle and
any pair of bundles.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.560 align:middle line:84%
So pick two, look at
their utility numbers,

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.070 align:middle line:84%
and we have the ranking
implied by the utility.

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.690 align:middle line:84%
Some utility numbers
are higher than others.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.850 align:middle line:90%
So we can rank everything.

00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:04.710 align:middle line:84%
That's why when we have
a utility function,

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:06.900 align:middle line:90%
the ranking is complete.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.610 align:middle line:84%
The ranking is transitive
because if the utility number

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.240 align:middle line:84%
of a is greater than or equal
to the utility number of b,

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.880 align:middle line:84%
and b's utility number
is higher than c,

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.980 align:middle line:84%
then we have transitivity under
the ordinary weak inequality.

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:27.150 align:middle line:84%
So the one implies the
other, essentially.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:29.805 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we're going
from the existence of-- oh,

00:15:29.805 --> 00:15:32.610 align:middle line:84%
and we're given
continuous, which

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.790 align:middle line:84%
was the third property of a
rational preference ordering.

00:15:35.790 --> 00:15:37.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's embedded
in the utility.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:40.950 align:middle line:84%
So obviously, two bundles
which are close to each other

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:44.750 align:middle line:84%
are going to have very
close utility values.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.990 align:middle line:84%
There's something very
deceptive about this lecture

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.850 align:middle line:84%
because no slide is
particularly hard, I think.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:55.580 align:middle line:84%
Of course you should
alert me if otherwise.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.920 align:middle line:84%
But yet somehow, when we
go through all of them,

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.530 align:middle line:84%
you'll be empowered with the
tools of consumer theory.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:05.150 align:middle line:84%
So it is definitely
worth doing this well.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:08.090 align:middle line:84%
Local non-satiation
is another property.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.690 align:middle line:84%
It says that if you're given
an x in the consumption set

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:84%
and an arbitrary
small number epsilon,

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:18.530 align:middle line:84%
there exists some other element
y in the consumption set

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:22.670 align:middle line:84%
so that when we're within an
epsilon neighborhood of x,

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:25.010 align:middle line:90%
we find this y.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:27.170 align:middle line:90%
And y is preferred to x.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.900 align:middle line:84%
In other words, it's a
little weaker than global,

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:31.190 align:middle line:90%
which is on the next slide.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:34.370 align:middle line:84%
Local just means you start
with x, draw a circle

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.950 align:middle line:90%
around it in Euclidean space--

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:41.330 align:middle line:84%
two-dimensional, or a sphere, or
in higher dimensional objects.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:42.740 align:middle line:84%
And you can always
find something

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:47.810 align:middle line:84%
in that area, however small,
that is strictly preferred

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:50.030 align:middle line:90%
to the starting point x.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:53.270 align:middle line:84%
Eventually, we'll get to
competitive equilibria

00:16:53.270 --> 00:16:55.640 align:middle line:90%
or entire economies.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.830 align:middle line:84%
Are competitive
equilibria optimal?

00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:02.630 align:middle line:84%
The answer may be no if we
lose this local non-satiation.

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.910 align:middle line:90%
So it will sneak back up on us.

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.040 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
there's no bliss point.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.410 align:middle line:84%
This is the dismal
view of economics,

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:12.520 align:middle line:84%
I suppose, that more is
always preferred to less,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.890 align:middle line:84%
and people just
can't get enough.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:21.050 align:middle line:84%
Here's a more global view of
it, which is with two goods.

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.960 align:middle line:90%
We start with this bundle here.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:28.790 align:middle line:84%
This whole hatched-in
area has more of one

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:30.440 align:middle line:90%
or the other or both goods.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.210 align:middle line:84%
And it's the weakly or strictly
preferred set relative to that.

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:37.640 align:middle line:84%
In fact, if they
value both goods,

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.453 align:middle line:84%
then even if you
keep one constant,

00:17:39.453 --> 00:17:40.620 align:middle line:90%
you're increasing the other.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.380 align:middle line:84%
So it's a strictly
preferred set.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.780 align:middle line:84%
This, which has less
of one or the other

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:48.860 align:middle line:84%
of both relative to the starting
point, is the worse-than set.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.160 align:middle line:84%
So back to rank ordering,
we start here and say,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.510 align:middle line:90%
what about a bundle here?

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.210 align:middle line:90%
Well, that's strictly preferred.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.060 align:middle line:84%
Start here, what
about going southwest?

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.370 align:middle line:84%
Then the original bundle
is strictly preferred.

00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:05.060 align:middle line:84%
But we leave some question marks
in these off-diagonal elements,

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:05.780 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Because it has more of one
good and less than another.

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:10.820 align:middle line:84%
So a priori we're
not able to say

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:15.210 align:middle line:84%
what the consumer would choose
without providing more details.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:19.640 align:middle line:84%
But we can provide those
details if we go back to, say,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.070 align:middle line:84%
the representation of
the utility function.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:27.440 align:middle line:84%
So we pick a bundle,
and it's associated

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.200 align:middle line:90%
with a given level of utility.

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.540 align:middle line:90%
Remember Jeremy Bentham.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:38.780 align:middle line:84%
And then we ask what other
values in this consumption set

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.390 align:middle line:84%
would generate the same utility
level as the starting point?

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:48.960 align:middle line:84%
And that's the entire set
of bundles on this curve.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.260 align:middle line:84%
So this is called an
"indifference curve,"

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:54.420 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that
these two bundles--

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.330 align:middle line:90%
x1, y1 and x2, y2--

00:18:57.330 --> 00:19:01.500 align:middle line:84%
under the consumer's preferences
are indifferent to each other.

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.450 align:middle line:84%
It might have been
better to call it

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.560 align:middle line:84%
an "isoutility curve," because
that language is even closer

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.000 align:middle line:90%
to what it is.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.750 align:middle line:84%
And later in the class, when
we get to production functions,

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.400 align:middle line:90%
we can talk about isoquants.

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.240 align:middle line:84%
And later we can
talk about isocosts.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.760 align:middle line:84%
And this is isoutility--
same utility.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:25.680 align:middle line:84%
Or traditionally, it's called
the "indifference curve."

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is drawn with a
certain diminishing slope,

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:31.520 align:middle line:84%
and I'll come back
to that momentarily.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.560 align:middle line:84%
Well, of course, there's
more than one curve.

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:38.230 align:middle line:84%
Because under a utility
function, it's complete.

00:19:38.230 --> 00:19:39.730 align:middle line:90%
So everything has a ranking.

00:19:39.730 --> 00:19:42.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's jump up here--

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:43.770 align:middle line:90%
utility levels are higher.

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.410 align:middle line:90%
Jump up here, higher still.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:84%
So as you move northeast,
we're moving in the direction

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.260 align:middle line:90%
of strictly increasing utility.

00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.340 align:middle line:84%
In fact, stuff is going on
between these curves, too.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:01.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just utility levels
that are between U1 and U2.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.760 align:middle line:84%
So you typically
graphically just

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.730 align:middle line:90%
draw one or a finite number.

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.470 align:middle line:84%
We don't try to fill
the whole thing out

00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:84%
because then it
would just go black.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.130 align:middle line:90%
Let's try this diagram.

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:18.810 align:middle line:84%
This is indifference
curves that are crossing.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:26.310 align:middle line:84%
Note that A is northeast of B,
has more of both goods X and Y.

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:30.420 align:middle line:84%
So A must be strictly
preferred to B.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:35.220 align:middle line:84%
However, A is on the same
indifference curve as E,

00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.800 align:middle line:84%
the indifference
curve labeled U1.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.730 align:middle line:84%
And E is on the same
indifference curve as B,

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:45.280 align:middle line:90%
the indifference curve U2.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.380 align:middle line:84%
Under transitivity,
if the consumer

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.130 align:middle line:84%
is indifferent between A and
E and indifferent between E

00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:54.700 align:middle line:84%
and B, then by
transitivity, the consumer

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.380 align:middle line:84%
should be indifferent
between A and B.

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:59.110 align:middle line:84%
But we started out by saying
that the consumer strictly

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:03.310 align:middle line:84%
prefers A to B. So we end
up with a contradiction.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:05.905 align:middle line:84%
Hence, indifference
curves can never cross.

00:21:05.905 --> 00:21:09.260 align:middle line:90%


00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:12.720 align:middle line:90%
So let's come back to the slope.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.980 align:middle line:84%
Let's define the marginal
rate of substitution,

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.440 align:middle line:84%
the willingness to give
up one good for another,

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.090 align:middle line:84%
as the negative slope of
the indifference curve.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:29.260 align:middle line:84%
So that is, the marginal rate of
substitution, is how much of Y

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:32.350 align:middle line:84%
you have to get when
you give up 1 unit of X

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:35.470 align:middle line:84%
while keeping utility
constant at U1.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:39.430 align:middle line:84%
So that curve and
this number tell

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.400 align:middle line:84%
us something about trade-offs
that a household would

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.550 align:middle line:84%
willingly do to be
indifferent, or potentially,

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:48.650 align:middle line:90%
later, to even gain.

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back
to this slide, this

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:56.080 align:middle line:84%
is a diminishing marginal
rate of substitution.

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.690 align:middle line:84%
The slope is getting
less and less.

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:01.840 align:middle line:84%
It's obviously negative because
when you get more of one good,

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.340 align:middle line:84%
you're willing to
give up the other.

00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:04.990 align:middle line:90%
The issue is how much.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:08.200 align:middle line:84%
If you start off with
a modest amount of X1

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.620 align:middle line:84%
and a relatively
large amount of Y1,

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.310 align:middle line:84%
and you move down this
curve, the marginal rate

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.950 align:middle line:84%
of substitution
would be this slope.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:25.450 align:middle line:84%
But if you gave the household
more of X and less of Y,

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:28.450 align:middle line:84%
the slope becomes less
and less because here,

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:32.530 align:middle line:84%
as you move pointwise down,
you have more and more X.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.290 align:middle line:84%
But X is less and less
valued because you

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.700 align:middle line:90%
have more and more of it.

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.860 align:middle line:84%
You have less and less Y,
so Y is more and more valued

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.240 align:middle line:90%
as you give up more of it.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:47.560 align:middle line:84%
And so to make this
movement [INAUDIBLE],,

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.660 align:middle line:84%
you require more and more X as
you surrender a given unit of Y

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.520 align:middle line:84%
in order to maintain
the indifference

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.630 align:middle line:90%
on the indifference curve.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.460 align:middle line:84%
I mean, down here,
it's almost flat.

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:03.630 align:middle line:84%
You just have so much of
good X that variation of it

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:05.580 align:middle line:84%
doesn't change
utility very much.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:11.940 align:middle line:84%
So you don't have to change Y.
And here, it's almost vertical.

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.490 align:middle line:84%
So we normally assume the
marginal rate of substitution

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.950 align:middle line:84%
is decreasing, just
as in that diagram.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:21.190 align:middle line:84%
And the intuition is they
want things to be balanced.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.280 align:middle line:84%
And then we're about
to get to notions

00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:28.330 align:middle line:84%
of convexity and concavity,
but I'll wait for that slide.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:29.820 align:middle line:84%
One thing I want
to say right away

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.010 align:middle line:84%
is that the marginal
rate of substitution

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:34.560 align:middle line:90%
doesn't have to be decreasing.

00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.370 align:middle line:84%
If indifference curves are
linear, as they are here,

00:23:38.370 --> 00:23:40.770 align:middle line:90%
then the slope is the same.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:43.030 align:middle line:90%
It's a line, after all.

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:44.670 align:middle line:84%
So the marginal
rate of substitution

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.580 align:middle line:84%
is not diminishing,
it's constant.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:52.670 align:middle line:84%
And here, we have
our classic case,

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.970 align:middle line:84%
which is the way
they're typically drawn.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.390 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's the
opposite, which is

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.020 align:middle line:84%
if you start at
this point of the L

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:04.780 align:middle line:84%
and move in the direction
of having more of good X

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:07.810 align:middle line:90%
you would gain no extra utility.

00:24:07.810 --> 00:24:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, if you started at
this point and had more Y,

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.970 align:middle line:90%
you would gain no extra utility.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.450 align:middle line:84%
The only way to achieve
higher levels of utility going

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:22.960 align:middle line:84%
from U0 to U1, et
cetera, is to increase

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.190 align:middle line:84%
both, and in the exact
same proportions.

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.620 align:middle line:84%
So these are sometimes called
Leontiefian indifference

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.440 align:middle line:84%
curves, although he really
created them in production,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.330 align:middle line:84%
and we'll get to
that in two lectures.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.570 align:middle line:84%
So the degree of
substitutability--

00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:42.580 align:middle line:84%
these are very curved, these
are linear, these are kinked--

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.460 align:middle line:84%
is something called the
"elasticity of substitution."

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:49.480 align:middle line:84%
So these are constant elasticity
of substitution curves

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:55.580 align:middle line:84%
that are parameterized by
the degree of curvature.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:58.270 align:middle line:84%
And here are some
particular functions.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.040 align:middle line:90%
This one's called Cobb-Douglas.

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:05.110 align:middle line:84%
He was an Economist at
Illinois, or Douglas was.

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:10.250 align:middle line:84%
Senator Douglas-- I think he
was a Senator from Illinois when

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:12.340 align:middle line:90%
it was an agricultural state.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.260 align:middle line:84%
I'd have to check
that to be sure.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.830 align:middle line:84%
So x to the power alpha,
y to the power of beta--

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:25.220 align:middle line:84%
perfect complements,
which is this one is here,

00:25:25.220 --> 00:25:28.565 align:middle line:84%
you can see the ratio
I was referring to.

00:25:28.565 --> 00:25:33.050 align:middle line:84%
To maintain utility
constant, the ratio of y to x

00:25:33.050 --> 00:25:34.910 align:middle line:90%
has to be alpha over beta.

00:25:34.910 --> 00:25:39.340 align:middle line:84%
Perfect substitutes,
linear, constant elasticity

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:42.040 align:middle line:90%
of substitution, this function.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.780 align:middle line:84%
And we will use these
for numerical examples,

00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:47.985 align:middle line:84%
and p sets, and so
on, from time to time.

00:25:47.985 --> 00:25:51.120 align:middle line:90%


00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:54.930 align:middle line:84%
OK, now we get to convexity,
and quasi-convexity, and all

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:56.160 align:middle line:90%
of that stuff.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.800 align:middle line:84%
So a set X, like
a consumption set,

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:06.320 align:middle line:84%
is convex if whenever you have
two separate bundles x and x

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.700 align:middle line:84%
prime in the set, and you take a
linear combination of those two

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.310 align:middle line:90%
points with weights alpha--

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:90%
say alpha between 0 and 1--

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.770 align:middle line:84%
then this new point
is also in the set.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:22.450 align:middle line:84%
So it's a standard
definition of a convex set.

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.530 align:middle line:84%
A function is said to
be convex if whenever

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:30.940 align:middle line:84%
you have two points x prime
and y prime, and x and x prime

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:36.100 align:middle line:84%
and you evaluate the function
f, then the weighted average

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:40.090 align:middle line:84%
of those two points over
here evaluated under f

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:43.000 align:middle line:84%
is less than the
weighted average

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.060 align:middle line:90%
in the range of the function.

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.290 align:middle line:84%
So that's a definition
of a convex function.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:55.350 align:middle line:84%
The set of points on or above
the graph of a convex function

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.680 align:middle line:90%
is convex.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.710 align:middle line:84%
So that's kind of linking
these two definitions together.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:01.850 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you the
picture momentarily.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:05.460 align:middle line:84%
A convex function and
negative of a convex function

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.900 align:middle line:90%
is concave.

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:10.140 align:middle line:84%
To define quasi-convex--
a function

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:15.600 align:middle line:84%
f is not simply convex
but weaker quasi-convex

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:19.320 align:middle line:84%
if whenever you evaluate
the two end points, and x,

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:22.200 align:middle line:84%
and x prime, and take
the max of the two,

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.380 align:middle line:84%
it's no less than the
function evaluated

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.700 align:middle line:90%
at the weighted average.

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:30.900 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the negative
of a quasi-convex function

00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.540 align:middle line:90%
is said to be quasi-concave.

00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:35.970 align:middle line:84%
So what are we
going to use here?

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.650 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you a
picture where we'll

00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:41.970 align:middle line:84%
display convexity of a set,
convexity of a function,

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:45.590 align:middle line:90%
and the use of quasi-concavity.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.790 align:middle line:84%
So this is the one
that is consistent

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:49.780 align:middle line:90%
with the definitions.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:51.640 align:middle line:90%
This is the one that is not.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:58.240 align:middle line:84%
So this indifference curve is a
curve in the space of x and y.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And it's convex,
actually strictly convex.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.410 align:middle line:84%
The set of points with
utility greater than

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:08.380 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the
utility associated

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.430 align:middle line:84%
with this indifference
curve is this hatched area.

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:14.120 align:middle line:90%
And this is a convex set.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.340 align:middle line:90%
You pick any two points--

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.740 align:middle line:84%
for example, this
one and this one--

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.290 align:middle line:84%
and take a weighted
average, and you'll still

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:23.980 align:middle line:84%
have a utility level which is
greater than the utility is

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:25.720 align:middle line:90%
associated with U1.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.830 align:middle line:84%
If you looked at the definition
of quasi-concave utility

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:33.100 align:middle line:84%
function, we take the
utility function which

00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.830 align:middle line:84%
is generating these
indifference curves, and say,

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.920 align:middle line:84%
what's the utility at this point
under that utility function?

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.160 align:middle line:84%
What's the utility at this point
under that utility function?

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.670 align:middle line:84%
Take the max of
those two, and then

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:49.540 align:middle line:84%
show that the weighted
average on the line

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.130 align:middle line:84%
gives a strictly
higher utility level.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:29:01.330 align:middle line:84%
So quasi-concave function
reverses the inequality here.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:84%
So the max of the utility
at each of the endpoints

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:09.340 align:middle line:84%
is less than the utility
at the weighted average.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:13.240 align:middle line:84%
So that is tedious, and
it's a bit hard to absorb,

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.682 align:middle line:84%
especially if you're not used
to using all of these things.

00:29:17.682 --> 00:29:19.390 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this is the
good-looking picture,

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:23.710 align:middle line:84%
and this one is ugly in the
sense that it violates every

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:24.700 align:middle line:90%
single--

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.270 align:middle line:84%
this property, this
utility indifference curve

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.070 align:middle line:90%
is not convex.

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:32.860 align:middle line:90%
It has some concave portion.

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:84%
The set of bundles on or
above the indifference curve,

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:38.170 align:middle line:84%
when you take weighted
averages of them,

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.720 align:middle line:84%
you would be below the
indifference curve,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:41.960 align:middle line:90%
violating the property.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.650 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, if you take
this point and this point,

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:46.990 align:middle line:84%
take the max of the two,
and take a weighted average,

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:51.030 align:middle line:84%
the utility is actually
now less than, not greater.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:54.660 align:middle line:84%
That quasi-convexity
or concavity of utility

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:56.170 align:middle line:90%
is a bit surprising.

00:29:56.170 --> 00:30:00.660 align:middle line:84%
It has to do with the ordinal
nature of the utility function.

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.030 align:middle line:84%
We don't want to say a
function is necessarily

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:07.080 align:middle line:84%
strictly concave, although that
would imply quasi-concavity.

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.750 align:middle line:84%
But we could take another
transformation that

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.450 align:middle line:84%
removes the strict
concavity, and it could still

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:13.860 align:middle line:90%
be quasi-concavity.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:17.700 align:middle line:84%
It's clear by plotting
in the choice space

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.670 align:middle line:84%
in this way, that
quasi-concavity

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:23.280 align:middle line:84%
is what we want, although
we haven't really

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:24.205 align:middle line:90%
talked about choices.

00:30:24.205 --> 00:30:25.830 align:middle line:84%
We're just talking
about rank ordering.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.730 align:middle line:90%


00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:33.020 align:middle line:84%
So marginal rate of
substitution defined a bit more

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:35.000 align:middle line:84%
mathematically--
we have a utility

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.430 align:middle line:90%
function over x1 and x2.

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:40.760 align:middle line:84%
We can call the marginal
utility the derivative

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.440 align:middle line:84%
of the utility with respect
to x1 or utility of x1,

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:47.540 align:middle line:90%
likewise for x2.

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, if we're moving along
an indifference curve,

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.220 align:middle line:84%
we're changing the
quantities of x and y,

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:58.300 align:middle line:84%
but we're keeping
utility constant.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.920 align:middle line:84%
So dU, or the total
differentiable of utility,

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.770 align:middle line:84%
does not change as we move
along an indifference curve.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:09.960 align:middle line:84%
So dU here would be the
derivative of utility

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:14.010 align:middle line:84%
with respect to X1 times dX1
plus the utility with respect

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:18.090 align:middle line:84%
to marginal utility with
respect to X2 times dX2.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.390 align:middle line:90%
That's this expression.

00:31:19.390 --> 00:31:22.350 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be 0 by
definition of moving along

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.180 align:middle line:90%
an indifference curve.

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.110 align:middle line:84%
Since it's equal to 0,
we can solve for dX2.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.180 align:middle line:84%
I think you can visualize
what happens here.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:35.280 align:middle line:84%
dX2 divided by dX1
is equal to the ratio

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.870 align:middle line:90%
of these marginal utilities.

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:39.640 align:middle line:84%
Rather than derive
this every time,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.250 align:middle line:84%
although it's a bit
dangerous to memorize things,

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:44.410 align:middle line:84%
basically in that
diagram, we have

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:47.410 align:middle line:84%
x1 on the x-axis,
x2 on the y-axis.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.240 align:middle line:84%
And the marginal
rate of substitution

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.570 align:middle line:84%
is the negative of
the marginal utility

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:55.030 align:middle line:84%
on the x-axis and marginal
utility on the y-axis.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:59.000 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.880 align:middle line:84%
Another definition--
homothetic preferences--

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.340 align:middle line:84%
so preferences are
homothetic means

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.770 align:middle line:84%
that the marginal
rate of substitution

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.590 align:middle line:84%
depends only on the
ratio of the goods

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:13.490 align:middle line:90%
and not on the total quantity.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:16.070 align:middle line:84%
So a picture is worth
a thousand words.

00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:19.560 align:middle line:84%
Here's an indifference
curve, here's a point.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.530 align:middle line:84%
What is the marginal
rate of substitution?

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:26.350 align:middle line:84%
The slope of that point,
of the curve at that point.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:31.680 align:middle line:84%
Here's the ratio of the
goods, X2 to X1 on this line.

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:35.220 align:middle line:84%
As you move on this line,
that ratio stays constant.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:38.460 align:middle line:84%
We go up here to this higher
level of indifference,

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:39.940 align:middle line:90%
the slope is the same.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.450 align:middle line:84%
So essentially, this
indifference curve

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:44.230 align:middle line:90%
is a blowup of this one.

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.160 align:middle line:84%
And you could draw
one out here, which is

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.140 align:middle line:90%
a radial blowup of these two.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:52.110 align:middle line:84%
So you can scale up
and down, and just

00:32:52.110 --> 00:32:55.890 align:middle line:84%
keep the slopes the same
as you move, for example,

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.810 align:middle line:84%
along either one
of these two lines.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.030 align:middle line:90%
So who cares?

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:04.050 align:middle line:84%
Well it's going to turn out that
a household with these kinds

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:07.530 align:middle line:84%
of indifference curves is going
to respond in a certain way

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:11.010 align:middle line:84%
to income, respond in a
certain linear way, that's

00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.530 align:middle line:84%
going to allow us to,
for some purposes,

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:15.990 align:middle line:84%
aggregate up over many
diverse households,

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.840 align:middle line:84%
and act like there's
only one representative

00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:22.590 align:middle line:84%
Robinson Crusoe macro
household in the economy.

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:24.480 align:middle line:84%
You probably don't
remember, but when

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.540 align:middle line:84%
I went through the great,
big, long syllabus last time,

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:31.870 align:middle line:84%
the next to last page
talked about aggregation.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:34.630 align:middle line:84%
And the lecture
on Tuesday will be

00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:38.560 align:middle line:84%
an example that violates
this kind of homotheticity.

00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.560 align:middle line:90%


00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.300 align:middle line:90%
Here's a violation.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:44.920 align:middle line:84%
We have a utility
function which is

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:49.780 align:middle line:84%
linear in one good, x1,
which we'll call money.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:55.640 align:middle line:84%
And the log of x2 is not
linear, but it is concave.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:84%
So we call this the
money good because as you

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.920 align:middle line:84%
inject or take away
good 1, utility

00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.680 align:middle line:90%
goes up or down linearly.

00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.370 align:middle line:84%
And it is also true that
if everyone in the economy

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:15.320 align:middle line:84%
has linear utility functions in
x1, then the amount of utility

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.340 align:middle line:84%
goes down when you tax somebody
is exactly the same amount

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:20.989 align:middle line:84%
that utility goes
up for somebody

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.310 align:middle line:90%
else who got the subsidy.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:26.460 align:middle line:84%
So again, that's a
useful property to have,

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:27.679 align:middle line:90%
but it's very special.

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:31.230 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, in this case, the
marginal rate of substitution,

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:34.760 align:middle line:84%
which is not constant on
any rate from the origin,

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.260 align:middle line:84%
the marginal rate
of substitution

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:40.460 align:middle line:84%
is constant as we
fix x2 and vary x1,

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.040 align:middle line:90%
so going along horizontally.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.409 align:middle line:84%
And you can convince
yourself that has to be true.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.449 align:middle line:84%
Because if you took
the definition, which

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.730 align:middle line:84%
is the marginal
utility of x1 divided

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:53.000 align:middle line:84%
by the marginal utility
of x2, the marginal x1

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.440 align:middle line:90%
is constant because it's linear.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:56.780 align:middle line:84%
And this thing is
varying with x2.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.120 align:middle line:84%
So if you fix x2
and vary x1, you're

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:03.530 align:middle line:84%
not going to change the
marginal rate of substitution.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.700 align:middle line:84%
So we have now
successfully reviewed

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:09.850 align:middle line:84%
basic properties of
consumption sets,

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.500 align:middle line:90%
consumer preferences, and so on.

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.010 align:middle line:84%
You might want to squirrel
away some of those properties

00:35:15.010 --> 00:35:18.470 align:middle line:84%
because we'll come back to them
later throughout the course,

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:19.780 align:middle line:90%
in the subsequent lectures.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.510 align:middle line:84%
But here they are,
essentially all listed now.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.500 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't mean they
all have to be true.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.590 align:middle line:84%
Some of them
contradict each other.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.710 align:middle line:84%
Theorems are if we have
local non-satiation

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:31.870 align:middle line:84%
then a competitive
equilibrium is optimal.

00:35:31.870 --> 00:35:33.640 align:middle line:84%
But we may not have
it, in which case

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:36.200 align:middle line:84%
competitive markets don't
work, and things like that.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.000 align:middle line:90%
So these are not requirements.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.610 align:middle line:90%
These are options.

00:35:39.610 --> 00:35:42.970 align:middle line:84%
All right, but now we
get to an application,

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.470 align:middle line:84%
this partial
equilibrium problem,

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.670 align:middle line:84%
which is to maximize utility
subject to a constraint

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:49.640 align:middle line:90%
for the first time.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:52.360 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
budget constraint.

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:54.280 align:middle line:90%
Income on the right-hand side--

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.920 align:middle line:84%
I for income-- is
taken as given.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:59.560 align:middle line:90%
The prices are of each good.

00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:04.430 align:middle line:84%
There are n of them, p1 for good
1, p2 for good 2, and so on.

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:09.820 align:middle line:84%
So the sum of the expenditures
at prices p over choices x

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:14.950 align:middle line:84%
cannot exceed the income
I. So this is your budget.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.330 align:middle line:90%
We all have budgets.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:19.630 align:middle line:84%
I sometimes wonder
about the US Treasury,

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:22.570 align:middle line:84%
its budget deficit,
debt outstanding,

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:26.410 align:middle line:84%
is now larger than any
time since World War II.

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:29.440 align:middle line:90%
But households have budgets.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.010 align:middle line:84%
And I'm worried
about the government,

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:34.510 align:middle line:90%
but we'll get to that later.

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:37.870 align:middle line:84%
So suppose you were to
double all the prices.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:42.140 align:middle line:84%
We start with this, and
we double income as well.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:47.590 align:middle line:84%
So we pre-multiply every term
by t, little t, both on the left

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.030 align:middle line:90%
and on the right.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.260 align:middle line:84%
It's a constraint
in the problem,

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:53.440 align:middle line:84%
but it doesn't
change the constraint

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.420 align:middle line:90%
by multiplying through by t.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:59.650 align:middle line:84%
Or if you started with t, in
there, just divide everything

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.940 align:middle line:90%
by t and you take it out.

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:04.390 align:middle line:84%
So it can't change
the math of anything.

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:05.800 align:middle line:90%
So that's one way to look at it.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.810 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you in the
picture in a minute

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:12.700 align:middle line:84%
that no price illusion-- if
prices double as in inflation,

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.160 align:middle line:84%
but your nominal
income also doubles,

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:19.210 align:middle line:84%
no harm, no foul, at least
not for this household.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:21.250 align:middle line:84%
Now, maybe consumers
aren't rational

00:37:21.250 --> 00:37:24.820 align:middle line:84%
and maybe they're sensitive
to income movement and not

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.103 align:middle line:90%
price or vice versa.

00:37:26.103 --> 00:37:27.520 align:middle line:84%
But for the most
part, we're going

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.583 align:middle line:84%
to assume that
these are equivalent

00:37:29.583 --> 00:37:31.750 align:middle line:84%
constraints from the point
of view of the household.

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:35.380 align:middle line:84%
And this is a definition
of homogeneity of degree

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:37.390 align:middle line:90%
0 of individual demand.

00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:40.760 align:middle line:84%
The demand can't change because
the constraint doesn't change.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.140 align:middle line:90%
And here's the picture.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:46.180 align:middle line:84%
So this is the set of points
which completely exhaust income

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:50.050 align:middle line:84%
when there are two goods,
x and y, P x and P y.

00:37:50.050 --> 00:37:52.300 align:middle line:84%
You could move over
to this extreme point,

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.820 align:middle line:84%
take all of your
income, and buy good y.

00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:57.220 align:middle line:90%
How many units can you get?

00:37:57.220 --> 00:38:00.310 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's $10
divided by 5, or 2.

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:02.740 align:middle line:84%
So we have a maximum
amount that would

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:04.630 align:middle line:84%
be possible to
purchase of good y,

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.120 align:middle line:84%
and maximum amount you
could purchase of good x.

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.030 align:middle line:84%
We have exhaustion of
the budget on this line.

00:38:10.030 --> 00:38:14.140 align:middle line:84%
Actually in the interior, we're
spending less than income.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:16.840 align:middle line:84%
Consumer might not want
to end up in the interior,

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:20.020 align:middle line:84%
but that has to
do with satiation.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.720 align:middle line:84%
What is the slope
of this budget line?

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, you can derive
this the same way

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:27.490 align:middle line:84%
we kept utility constant--
keep income constant,

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:30.310 align:middle line:84%
take dI, set it to
0, and then take

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:34.630 align:middle line:84%
the derivative of P X
times dX plus P Y times dY,

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:38.440 align:middle line:84%
and you get dYdX is
equal to P X over P Y.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So the ratio of this line
is exactly P X over P Y.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:48.670 align:middle line:84%
It is kind of interesting
that only the ratio matters.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:50.620 align:middle line:84%
That is to say,
setting aside what's

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.210 align:middle line:84%
going to happen
to income, if you

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.370 align:middle line:84%
double all the
prices of both goods,

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.110 align:middle line:84%
you don't change the
slope of this line.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:38:59.830 align:middle line:84%
In fact, more than that, we
could pick one of these goods--

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.050 align:middle line:90%
say Y as the numeraire--

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:04.330 align:middle line:84%
set P Y equal to
1, and then we'd

00:39:04.330 --> 00:39:08.840 align:middle line:84%
only be fussing about
the price of good X.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.890 align:middle line:90%
Here it's more general.

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Everything's in dollars
or some unit of account,

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:14.960 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
country you're in.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.330 align:middle line:84%
Could be measured
in wheat, goods.

00:39:17.330 --> 00:39:20.810 align:middle line:84%
Price is measured in terms
of how many bushels of wheat

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:21.920 align:middle line:90%
you can buy.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:23.270 align:middle line:90%
So it's arbitrary.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:27.200 align:middle line:84%
You have to specify what it
is, but only the ratio matters.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.210 align:middle line:90%
That thing about inflation--

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.540 align:middle line:84%
it's like doubling prices
and doubling income

00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.580 align:middle line:90%
doesn't change this line.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.880 align:middle line:84%
And where does the
consumer choose to be?

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.870 align:middle line:90%
Here, C for choice, maybe.

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:43.790 align:middle line:90%
So why?

00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:46.460 align:middle line:90%
Well, one way to view it--

00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:50.530 align:middle line:84%
the household wants
maximal utility.

00:39:50.530 --> 00:39:55.870 align:middle line:84%
So in the set of choices
inside or on the budget line,

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.300 align:middle line:84%
what point has the
highest utility level?

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.370 align:middle line:84%
It's point C. If you
go this way, it's less.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:03.750 align:middle line:90%
If you go this way, it's less.

00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:05.670 align:middle line:84%
There's another
somewhat interesting way

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:08.940 align:middle line:84%
to view this marginal
analysis, which

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:12.810 align:middle line:84%
is if you start it up here,
the slope of this indifference

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.390 align:middle line:90%
curve U1 is pretty steep.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:18.360 align:middle line:84%
It's negative, but I mean
steep in absolute value.

00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.150 align:middle line:84%
And the slope of the
budget line is less.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.520 align:middle line:84%
That means this household's
willing to give up

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:27.840 align:middle line:84%
a substantial amount of good Y
to get one more unit of good X

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.650 align:middle line:84%
as he or she moves away
from B. But in fact, given

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:34.920 align:middle line:84%
the prices in the market, you
don't have to give up that

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.400 align:middle line:84%
much to gain value in order
to be able to purchase

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.440 align:middle line:90%
X. You give up less Y.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.230 align:middle line:84%
So this is what you're willing
to give up and be indifferent,

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.510 align:middle line:84%
but you are allowed to give
up less on the budget line.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:48.570 align:middle line:84%
So you're definitely moving
in the direction here

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:50.340 align:middle line:90%
of higher and higher utility.

00:40:50.340 --> 00:40:53.880 align:middle line:84%
And you can conduct the same
reverse experiment down here.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So next, let's do a utility
maximization problem.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:03.270 align:middle line:84%
And as I promised last time, I'm
going to introduce a cool tool.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:07.190 align:middle line:90%
And it's called the Lagrangian.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:11.330 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to maximize
utility subject to a budget,

00:41:11.330 --> 00:41:13.580 align:middle line:90%
set up the problem in this way--

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Lagrangian, which is the French
guy that figured all this out,

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:23.120 align:middle line:84%
Lagrange, is to write
down the utility function

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:30.080 align:middle line:84%
plus a shadow price lambda times
a repetition of the constraint.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.770 align:middle line:84%
So we turn the direct
maximization problem,

00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:39.400 align:middle line:84%
which was this, into
a pseudo problem where

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.700 align:middle line:84%
the constraint is actually
in the objective function.

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.620 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, if you start
taking derivatives

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.530 align:middle line:84%
of this looking for the
first-order conditions

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:51.520 align:middle line:84%
for a maximum, the derivative
of the entire expression

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:55.570 align:middle line:84%
with respect to x k is the way
that k will enter and generate

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.810 align:middle line:84%
marginal utility under
U. That's this term.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.610 align:middle line:90%
Plus, we'll pick up lambda.

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.520 align:middle line:84%
And where else does
little x enter?

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.620 align:middle line:90%
Over here somewhere, P k.

00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:10.270 align:middle line:84%
It's linear in x
k coefficient P k.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:12.340 align:middle line:90%
So we get this thing.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.950 align:middle line:84%
And again, we're looking
for an interior solution.

00:42:14.950 --> 00:42:18.240 align:middle line:84%
We set this thing equal to
0 as a necessary condition

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.000 align:middle line:90%
for an optimum.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.630 align:middle line:84%
Lambda is actually a
control variable, too,

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:27.970 align:middle line:84%
the way the x's are, just
looks a little weird.

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:30.810 align:middle line:84%
We take the derivative
of the Lagrangian

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:33.180 align:middle line:84%
with respect to lambda,
and obviously, we're

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.100 align:middle line:84%
going to get the constraint
right back again.

00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:37.770 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
set it to 0, which

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.050 align:middle line:84%
we assumed before
that they wanted

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:41.430 align:middle line:90%
to spend all their income.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.590 align:middle line:84%
We were implicitly
assuming before

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:46.230 align:middle line:84%
that the marginal utility
of income was positive,

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:48.940 align:middle line:84%
or in this case, that
lambda is positive.

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's why we get the
constraint right back.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.930 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure if you've
seen Lagrangians before,

00:42:54.930 --> 00:42:58.500 align:middle line:84%
but it's just a version
of multivariate calculus

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.570 align:middle line:84%
where you find the
first-order conditions

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:01.990 align:middle line:90%
to a maximum problem.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Note that we can take any two
pair of bundles k and j, i

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:09.360 align:middle line:90%
and j, or whatever.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.130 align:middle line:84%
When you take them
pairwise, we're

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:14.070 align:middle line:84%
going to have the derivative
with respect to good I here

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.100 align:middle line:84%
and the price of good
I here and the lambda.

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:20.400 align:middle line:84%
That lambda is the
same when we go J, J.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.630 align:middle line:84%
So we can divide the
left by the right,

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.700 align:middle line:90%
and the lambda will disappear.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:31.200 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to get these
ratios of marginal utilities,

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:34.570 align:middle line:84%
which are, of course, the
marginal rate of substitution

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:35.820 align:middle line:90%
equal to the price ratio.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.110 align:middle line:90%


00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:40.880 align:middle line:90%
And that's what we were saying--

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.310 align:middle line:90%
maybe I didn't say it--

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:45.830 align:middle line:84%
when we have this
tangency over here,

00:43:45.830 --> 00:43:48.230 align:middle line:84%
the marginal rate of
substitution in utility

00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:50.520 align:middle line:84%
is the marginal rate of
substitution in the budget,

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.170 align:middle line:90%
which is the price ratio.

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:55.700 align:middle line:84%
So we're getting
that result back now

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.667 align:middle line:84%
as a consequence of
this optimization.

00:43:59.667 --> 00:44:01.500 align:middle line:84%
Another danger-- I feel
like I ought to have

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.850 align:middle line:90%
this slide that says, stop.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:03.720 align:middle line:90%
Pause.

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:06.840 align:middle line:90%
Do not memorize these diagrams.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.050 align:middle line:84%
Just like the notation
becomes mind numbing,

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:13.260 align:middle line:84%
you get used to drawing a
picture in a certain way.

00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.480 align:middle line:84%
And then when someone nasty
puts another specification

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:23.090 align:middle line:84%
on the table, you don't
know what to do with it.

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:25.840 align:middle line:90%
So here I am being nasty.

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:29.950 align:middle line:84%
I'll show you n incorporated
it into the Lagrangian.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:32.350 align:middle line:90%
So this is a corner solution.

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:35.840 align:middle line:90%
Where is the best utility level?

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:39.310 align:middle line:84%
The highest level is here
because as you move down

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.890 align:middle line:84%
this budget line
on the line, you

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:44.140 align:middle line:84%
get higher and higher
levels of utility.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:46.970 align:middle line:84%
But if the
consumption set is all

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:50.080 align:middle line:84%
of this non-negative [INAUDIBLE]
you can't go negative in y.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.730 align:middle line:90%
So you stop.

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.380 align:middle line:90%
This is a corner solution.

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:56.890 align:middle line:84%
By the way, you would get
this as well if the utility

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:58.580 align:middle line:90%
functions were linear.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:02.320 align:middle line:84%
They're almost linear here,
and you have a corner solution.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:04.720 align:middle line:84%
Of course, they could
be linear and coincident

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:07.690 align:middle line:84%
with the budget, in which case
everything on the budget line

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:08.740 align:middle line:90%
is an optimum.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:11.110 align:middle line:84%
Or those linear
indifference curves

00:45:11.110 --> 00:45:13.570 align:middle line:84%
could be really
flat, in which case

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.700 align:middle line:84%
you'll go over here
to a different corner.

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.130 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to be
linear to generate corners.

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:19.900 align:middle line:90%
This is an example.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.290 align:middle line:84%
But we need to incorporate it
into our maximum techniques.

00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:26.500 align:middle line:90%
So what's the general recipe?

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:30.050 align:middle line:84%
Before we translate it into the
consumer optimization problem,

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:31.600 align:middle line:90%
we'll get the technique down.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:35.660 align:middle line:84%
As I promised, you're being
gifted with a powerful tool.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:39.550 align:middle line:84%
So we have a function
f over a range x.

00:45:39.550 --> 00:45:41.170 align:middle line:90%
We want to maximize it.

00:45:41.170 --> 00:45:44.140 align:middle line:90%
And we have various constraints.

00:45:44.140 --> 00:45:46.240 align:middle line:90%
We have n of them.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.620 align:middle line:90%
g i of x-- g is a function.

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:55.000 align:middle line:84%
There are i functions, each
of which, when evaluated at x,

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.650 align:middle line:90%
cannot be negative.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:01.660 align:middle line:84%
Properties f and g i are
real-valued, continuously

00:46:01.660 --> 00:46:02.590 align:middle line:90%
differentiable.

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:04.960 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
they're very smooth,

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.060 align:middle line:84%
and not only continuous, the
derivatives are continuous.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:09.610 align:middle line:90%
How do we solve this problem?

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:13.210 align:middle line:84%
Look it up in the cookbook,
or memorize it, even better.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:16.060 align:middle line:84%
There's a trick
here I'll show you.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:20.090 align:middle line:84%
The Lagrangian put the objective
function, just like we had U.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:23.410 align:middle line:84%
And now write down each and
every one of these constraints

00:46:23.410 --> 00:46:28.890 align:middle line:84%
with these Lagrange multipliers
lambda i for constraint i,

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:30.310 align:middle line:90%
add them all up.

00:46:30.310 --> 00:46:31.750 align:middle line:90%
What's the little trick?

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:33.430 align:middle line:90%
The g i is non-negative.

00:46:33.430 --> 00:46:36.310 align:middle line:84%
We enter it with a plus
sign, and then things

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:38.410 align:middle line:84%
are going to come out
right with the math.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:39.940 align:middle line:90%
It's not necessary.

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.280 align:middle line:84%
Things work even
if you write down

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.290 align:middle line:84%
the g's as less
than or equal to 0,

00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:46.930 align:middle line:84%
but then you have to
struggle a little bit more

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.790 align:middle line:84%
to make sure you've
got the math right,

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:50.680 align:middle line:90%
and you didn't reverse the sign.

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:53.590 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, try to do it
this way-- g i greater than

00:46:53.590 --> 00:46:55.390 align:middle line:90%
0 lambda g i.

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:57.040 align:middle line:84%
Write out the
first-order conditions.

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.730 align:middle line:90%
That's just a derivative.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:01.420 align:middle line:84%
So we're taking the
derivative of the Lagrangian

00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:04.210 align:middle line:84%
with respect to x k is the
derivative of the function

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:08.470 align:middle line:84%
f with respect to k plus
the way in which x k

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:11.740 align:middle line:84%
is entering in each
of these constraints g

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:15.520 align:middle line:84%
i, each pre-multiplied
by lambda i.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:20.560 align:middle line:84%
Set it equal to 0, and do
that for every argument x k.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.340 align:middle line:90%
With me?

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:24.240 align:middle line:90%


00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:29.020 align:middle line:84%
So next, write down
each constraint again.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:33.780 align:middle line:84%
Write down these multipliers
which are non-negative.

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.540 align:middle line:84%
And this is cool--
this is called

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.750 align:middle line:84%
a complementary slackness
condition, which

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:44.520 align:middle line:84%
is the multiplication-- oh, it
should be a lambda i on that.

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:45.960 align:middle line:90%
That's a typo.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:49.890 align:middle line:84%
Lambda i times g i equal
to 0, and then we're

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:53.160 align:middle line:84%
going to look for a solution
to all these equations.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:57.270 align:middle line:84%
Now, if lambda i were 0
then it doesn't matter

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:middle line:90%
what g is evaluated at x.

00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:00.420 align:middle line:90%
It's still 0.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:05.640 align:middle line:84%
Well, if lambda is 0,
then effectively, it's

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.390 align:middle line:84%
not entering into the problem,
and you can ignore it, and drop

00:48:09.390 --> 00:48:11.220 align:middle line:90%
it by setting it equal to 0.

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.010 align:middle line:84%
If lambda i were
strictly positive,

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:17.670 align:middle line:84%
though, then the only way you
can get this product to be 0

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:20.520 align:middle line:90%
is to have this g i be 0.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:21.580 align:middle line:90%
And that's here.

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is what happened
with the income maximization

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:25.350 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:28.200 align:middle line:84%
I asserted-- if we go
back now and look--

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.560 align:middle line:84%
that the marginal utility of
income lambda on the budget

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:33.460 align:middle line:90%
constraint was positive.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.040 align:middle line:84%
And if it's positive,
then we have

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.890 align:middle line:84%
to set the budget constraint
equal to 0, income

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.000 align:middle line:84%
equal to the sum
of expenditures,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.120 align:middle line:84%
which is the way we solved that
simpler problem to begin with.

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.690 align:middle line:84%
So what we did
earlier generalizes

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:47.850 align:middle line:90%
to this more complex.

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:49.080 align:middle line:90%
Now, why are we doing it?

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.720 align:middle line:84%
Well, let's come
back to this problem.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:52.800 align:middle line:90%
Are they necessary?

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.330 align:middle line:90%
They could also be sufficient.

00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:57.060 align:middle line:84%
If that function f
is quasi-concave,

00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.510 align:middle line:84%
and the constraint sets,
these guys, are convex,

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:03.510 align:middle line:84%
then finding a solution to
the first-order condition is

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:06.330 align:middle line:84%
equivalent with finding
a global maximizer--

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:10.920 align:middle line:84%
very powerful, and we will
use it subsequently, again,

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.010 align:middle line:84%
to address the issue of whether
competitive equilibria are

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:15.510 align:middle line:90%
optimal.

00:49:15.510 --> 00:49:18.160 align:middle line:90%


00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:23.080 align:middle line:84%
So going back to the motivation,
which was this picture--

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.510 align:middle line:84%
we kind of know that we're
going to hit a corner.

00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:26.860 align:middle line:90%
What comes up with the--

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.820 align:middle line:84%
if these were linear
indifference curves,

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.310 align:middle line:84%
and you had this
linear budget set, then

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.840 align:middle line:84%
when you take
first-order conditions

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.828 align:middle line:84%
you're going to be in
trouble because everything

00:49:37.828 --> 00:49:39.370 align:middle line:84%
in the first-order
condition is going

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.730 align:middle line:84%
to be parameters,
not control variables

00:49:42.730 --> 00:49:44.300 align:middle line:90%
that you want to find.

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's a version
of being nasty.

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.550 align:middle line:84%
But like I said, we're
working it all out.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:52.120 align:middle line:84%
So how do we deal with
this hitting the corner?

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.610 align:middle line:90%
What does the Lagrangian find?

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So we maximize utility
subject to the budget,

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:00.400 align:middle line:84%
subject to non-negativity
constraints.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.040 align:middle line:84%
As in that picture,
consumption cannot go negative.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:09.790 align:middle line:84%
We form the Lagrangian
mechanically, which

00:50:09.790 --> 00:50:12.460 align:middle line:84%
says write down the
function, write down

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:17.620 align:middle line:84%
each of the constraints, lambda
on the budget constraint, mu--

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:21.430 align:middle line:84%
I changed notation--
mu k for constraint,

00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:26.320 align:middle line:84%
this one, the non-negativity
constraint on x k,

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:28.460 align:middle line:90%
take the first-order conditions.

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.580 align:middle line:84%
And now we get
something similar,

00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:35.050 align:middle line:84%
except that you pick up this
shadow price or Lagrange

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:39.640 align:middle line:84%
multiplier on the non-negativity
constraint of good k.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.920 align:middle line:84%
Whereas before, that
mu wasn't there.

00:50:41.920 --> 00:50:44.200 align:middle line:84%
So then applying the
recipe, we write down

00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.340 align:middle line:90%
the constraints again.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.970 align:middle line:84%
We write down the non-negativity
of the Lagrange multipliers.

00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:51.830 align:middle line:84%
We have this complementary
slackness condition,

00:50:51.830 --> 00:50:53.950 align:middle line:84%
which is the product of
the Lagrange multipliers

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:58.640 align:middle line:84%
with the budgets, and
we look for a solution.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:03.200 align:middle line:84%
If we were at a
corner where good 1--

00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:05.840 align:middle line:84%
or good x, whatever
was in that figure--

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:13.570 align:middle line:84%
were 0, then if we go back
here, this would be positive.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.270 align:middle line:84%
This mu k would be positive,
and we take it out.

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:18.700 align:middle line:90%
This would then be less than 0.

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:21.790 align:middle line:84%
Something less than 0 plus
something positive makes it 0.

00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:24.640 align:middle line:84%
We leave the positive
thing out, and we

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:28.820 align:middle line:84%
get the thing that's less
than 0 looks like this.

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:30.820 align:middle line:84%
And what this says,
essentially, is--

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.843 align:middle line:84%
there's a number
of ways to read it.

00:51:32.843 --> 00:51:33.760 align:middle line:90%
Let me do it this way.

00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.170 align:middle line:90%
Put lambda over here.

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:38.270 align:middle line:84%
Lambda is the marginal
utility of income.

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:41.860 align:middle line:84%
So how much income does
it take to get good k?

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.320 align:middle line:84%
And what are the utility
consequences of that?

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.930 align:middle line:84%
p k is the number of dollars you
have to give up to get good k.

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:52.700 align:middle line:84%
The utility of those
dollars is lambda.

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:58.300 align:middle line:84%
So lambda times p k
is the marginal cost

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:00.610 align:middle line:90%
of getting a unit of good k.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.960 align:middle line:90%
And what's the marginal benefit?

00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:05.080 align:middle line:84%
The marginal utility
is the benefit.

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.120 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the marginal cost
exceeds the marginal benefit,

00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.290 align:middle line:90%
so you don't do it.

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.120 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the
solution, obviously,

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.990 align:middle line:84%
is to set x k equal to 0
because at any positive level,

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:17.590 align:middle line:84%
the marginal costs are higher
than the marginal benefits.

00:52:17.590 --> 00:52:20.542 align:middle line:84%
The best you can do
is to set it to 0.

00:52:20.542 --> 00:52:23.960 align:middle line:90%


00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So Cobb-Douglass utility-- this
was an example we had before.

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:35.420 align:middle line:84%
Good X and Y to power
alpha and 1 minus alpha

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:36.980 align:middle line:90%
subject to a budget--

00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:38.870 align:middle line:90%
you can solve this.

00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:42.800 align:middle line:84%
It's really not necessary
to go through in class.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.060 align:middle line:90%
It's a good example.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:44.960 align:middle line:90%
You maximize.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:50.130 align:middle line:84%
Using the Lagrangian, you get
the first-order conditions.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:52.440 align:middle line:84%
Do some algebra with that
first-order condition

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.360 align:middle line:90%
comparing ratios.

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.520 align:middle line:84%
This would be the marginal
rate of substitution.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.500 align:middle line:84%
This is going to
be the price ratio.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.990 align:middle line:84%
They have to be equal
for an interior solution.

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:03.840 align:middle line:84%
And the solution
has to be interior

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:06.180 align:middle line:84%
because the marginal
utility is going

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:09.690 align:middle line:84%
to infinity when one or the
other of these goods goes to 0.

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:13.230 align:middle line:84%
So you never want
to go down that far.

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:15.150 align:middle line:90%
We can rearrange these terms.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.180 align:middle line:84%
And the bottom line
is, p X times X

00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.290 align:middle line:84%
is the expenditure on X, and
it's equal to alpha times

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.680 align:middle line:84%
if I. If you go back to
the utility function,

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:29.250 align:middle line:90%
alpha is the power on X.

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:31.470 align:middle line:84%
So whenever you see
this Cobb-Douglas,

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:34.950 align:middle line:84%
you can immediately jump to
something you should know,

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:38.640 align:middle line:84%
which is the expenditure shares
have to do with these powers.

00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:41.220 align:middle line:84%
The expenditure shares
on X would be alpha.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.940 align:middle line:84%
The expenditure share on
Y would be 1 minus alpha.

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:47.190 align:middle line:90%
We want to see that in notation.

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:51.450 align:middle line:84%
p X times X is the expenditure
share on X at the optimum.

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:55.680 align:middle line:84%
It's alpha times I.
Likewise, p Y times Y

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.560 align:middle line:90%
is 1 minus alpha times I.

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:00.135 align:middle line:90%
So you have your whole budget.

00:54:00.135 --> 00:54:01.260 align:middle line:90%
You spend the whole budget.

00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.660 align:middle line:84%
And the share of the
budget you're spending

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:09.040 align:middle line:84%
is dictated by the alpha, and
1 minus alpha, and the prices.

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.360 align:middle line:84%
So that's constant
expenditure shares.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.960 align:middle line:84%
And again, when you go to
data, you go take a look.

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:16.435 align:middle line:84%
And we'll do that in the
lecture on next Tuesday.

00:54:16.435 --> 00:54:19.710 align:middle line:90%


00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:23.530 align:middle line:84%
Now again, we got
through all that stuff--

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:27.690 align:middle line:84%
hopefully useful, maybe
even interesting to you.

00:54:27.690 --> 00:54:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And now you've forgotten
about geography.

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:32.220 align:middle line:90%
You've forgotten about time.

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.510 align:middle line:84%
You've forgotten about
states of the world.

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:38.220 align:middle line:90%
So let me end with two slides--

00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.190 align:middle line:84%
the lecture about
consumer choice,

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:44.340 align:middle line:84%
when the consumer
decides how much leisure

00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:47.670 align:middle line:84%
to provide or negatively,
how much to work

00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:49.830 align:middle line:90%
and how much consumption to buy.

00:54:49.830 --> 00:54:53.100 align:middle line:84%
So it's going to be one
thing to say right away--

00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.620 align:middle line:84%
leisure is going
to be a good thing.

00:54:55.620 --> 00:54:57.490 align:middle line:90%
Consumption is a good thing.

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.940 align:middle line:84%
So those axes that
were labeled x and y

00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:02.310 align:middle line:84%
are now labeled c
and l, where c is

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:05.160 align:middle line:90%
consumption and l is leisure.

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:07.980 align:middle line:84%
So it looks standard now, but
it's a much more interesting

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:08.710 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:09.960 align:middle line:90%
It's how much to work problem.

00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.180 align:middle line:84%
It's like the
bicycle messengers.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.900 align:middle line:84%
The other thing is maximize
utility subject to the budget.

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.330 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of a
twist because instead

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:20.610 align:middle line:84%
of having income
over here, we've

00:55:20.610 --> 00:55:25.530 align:middle line:84%
got the wage, w, per unit
time times the time endowment

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:27.720 align:middle line:84%
that the household
is endowed with.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:32.310 align:middle line:84%
So this is as if you took
your entire time endowment,

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:36.810 align:middle line:84%
worked all of it, and then went
back and bought some leisure

00:55:36.810 --> 00:55:38.580 align:middle line:90%
and bought consumption.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:41.250 align:middle line:84%
Probably a more
obvious way to put this

00:55:41.250 --> 00:55:45.420 align:middle line:84%
is to take wl, subtract
it from both sides.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.640 align:middle line:90%
Then you have T minus l.

00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.370 align:middle line:84%
So time minus leisure is
the amount spent working.

00:55:51.370 --> 00:55:52.830 align:middle line:84%
You surrendered
it to the market.

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:56.100 align:middle line:84%
You don't enjoy it, but
you do get the wage for it.

00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.680 align:middle line:84%
And then this becomes
income, and income

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:00.263 align:middle line:90%
is spent on consumption.

00:56:00.263 --> 00:56:01.680 align:middle line:84%
The other thing
about this problem

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.350 align:middle line:84%
is like the choice
of a numeraire,

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:07.140 align:middle line:84%
everything is measured
in terms of consumption.

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:08.190 align:middle line:90%
There's no price.

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:09.780 align:middle line:90%
You could have done it.

00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:13.440 align:middle line:84%
You could have price of
consumption times consumption,

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:17.280 align:middle line:84%
price of leisure, the
wage times the leisure.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:19.600 align:middle line:90%
But we just normalized wages.

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:22.320 align:middle line:84%
So this is what's
called the real wage.

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.540 align:middle line:84%
It's how much consumption
bundle you can

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:27.840 align:middle line:90%
get for a given unit of labor.

00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:29.250 align:middle line:90%
And here's the picture.

00:56:29.250 --> 00:56:35.610 align:middle line:84%
So you're effectively starting
here, with 16 hours a day

00:56:35.610 --> 00:56:37.650 align:middle line:90%
of leisure.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:42.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't know, some sleep is
allowed, eight hour bedtime.

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.710 align:middle line:90%
The remaining is 16 hours.

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:46.900 align:middle line:84%
But you may want
to earn some money.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.780 align:middle line:84%
So if you move in
this direction,

00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:53.100 align:middle line:84%
you're giving up a unit of
leisure, working that unit,

00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.500 align:middle line:84%
and getting the
wage for it, which

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.340 align:middle line:90%
allows you to buy consumption.

00:56:57.340 --> 00:57:01.290 align:middle line:84%
So the slope of this
line is the wage.

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:03.100 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the
wage rate is 10.

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:06.360 align:middle line:84%
So every unit of
work that you supply

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.970 align:middle line:84%
gives you 10 units
worth of consumption.

00:57:08.970 --> 00:57:14.895 align:middle line:84%
And you could work your entire
16-hour day at a wage of 10,

00:57:14.895 --> 00:57:17.730 align:middle line:84%
and have 160 units
of consumption.

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:20.040 align:middle line:84%
But this guy is
stopping short of that,

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:23.440 align:middle line:84%
where the indifference curve
is tangent to the budget line.

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:26.140 align:middle line:84%
So this is the choice
of how hard to work.

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:30.600 align:middle line:84%
And again, I could have put
in a dynamic choice problem.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.040 align:middle line:90%
I could have put time--

00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.453 align:middle line:84%
consumption today versus
consumption tomorrow.

00:57:34.453 --> 00:57:36.870 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have one of
those at the end of the lecture

00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:37.530 align:middle line:90%
next time.

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:39.240 align:middle line:84%
As a constant
reminder, we could have

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.580 align:middle line:90%
had choice about locations.

00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:45.820 align:middle line:84%
And we'll do some of that
pretty shortly, as well.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:47.920 align:middle line:84%
All right, so that's
the prepared slides.

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:53.450 align:middle line:84%
And we have one or two
minutes left for questions.

00:57:53.450 --> 00:57:55.970 align:middle line:84%
All right, so you
have all the slides.

00:57:55.970 --> 00:57:57.650 align:middle line:90%
Take a look at them, study them.

00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:59.797 align:middle line:84%
You also have the
review sheet questions.

00:57:59.797 --> 00:58:01.630 align:middle line:84%
Go back and take a look
and make sure you're

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:02.740 align:middle line:90%
able to answer them.

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:05.720 align:middle line:84%
We'll have a little review
next time of what we did today.

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:10.330 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to go on
to explore these expenditure

00:58:10.330 --> 00:58:13.300 align:middle line:84%
shares, and income
expansion paths,

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:16.930 align:middle line:84%
and whether poor people
consume luxury goods

00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:18.520 align:middle line:90%
or the opposite, et cetera.

00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:22.120 align:middle line:90%
So that's for next time.

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:25.000 align:middle line:84%
I've already mentioned
last time something drawing

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.490 align:middle line:84%
on a real application
from the material we're

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:30.760 align:middle line:84%
going to do in the lecture
next Tuesday on China,

00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:37.270 align:middle line:84%
and kind of varying these price
ratios of these budget lines

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:41.030 align:middle line:84%
by subsidizing
consumer purchases.

00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:43.690 align:middle line:84%
It's a wonderful
problem set, worked out

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:45.970 align:middle line:84%
by one of your former
classmates, actually,

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:48.460 align:middle line:90%
who I hired as a UROP.

00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:51.460 align:middle line:84%
So you're almost in
the position to start

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:54.640 align:middle line:84%
to take the look at that,
especially after Friday,

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.350 align:middle line:90%
and certainly after Tuesday.

00:58:56.350 --> 00:58:59.400 align:middle line:90%
So that's all I have for today.

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:06.000 align:middle line:90%

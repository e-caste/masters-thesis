00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.600
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.660
Today we'll be talking a
little about angular momentum.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.220
Continuing the discussion
of those vector operators

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.080
and their identities
that we had last time.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.190
So it will allow us to make
quite a bit of progress

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.190
with those operators, and
understand them better.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.000
Then we'll go through
the algebraic analysis

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.470
of the spectrum.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.100
This is something
that probably you've

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.170
seen in some way or another,
perhaps in not so much detail.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.090
But you're probably
somewhat familiar,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.050
but it's good to see it again.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.210
And finally at the end
we'll discuss an application

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.700
that is related to your last
problem in the homework.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.130
And it's a rather
mysterious thing

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.680
that I think one
should appreciate

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.990
how unusual the
result is, related

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.180
to the two dimensional
harmonic oscillator.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.950
So I'll begin by reminding
you of a few things.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.460
We have L, which is r cross p.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.220
And we managed to
prove last time

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.430
that that was equal to p
cross r, with a minus sign.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.840
And then part of the
problem's that you're

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.720
solving with
angular momentum use

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.320
the concept of a vector
and the rotations.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:11.320
So if u is a vector
under rotations--

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.490
to say that something is a
vector under rotations means

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:25.800
the following, means that if you
compute Li commutator with uj,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.810
you can put a hat.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.650
All these things are
operators, all these vectors.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.650
So maybe I won't put a hat
here on the blackboard.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.010
Then you're supposed to get
i, epsilon, ijk, ih bar.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.170
Epsilon, ijk, uk.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.610
So that's a definition
if you wish.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.990
Any object that does that
is a vector under rotations.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.880
And something that in the
homework you can verify

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:07.910
is that r and p are
vectors under rotation.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.490
That is, if you put here xj,
you get this thing with xk.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.610
If you put here pj, you
get this thing with pk.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.230
If you compute the commutator.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.790
So r and p are vectors
under rotation.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.950
Then comes that little theorem,
that is awfully important,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:37.505
that shows that if u and v are
vectors under rotations-- u

00:03:37.505 --> 00:03:52.065
and v vectors under rotations--
then u dot v is a scalar.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.960
And u cross v is a vector.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.746
And in both cases,
under rotations.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.610
So this is something
you must prove,

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.350
because if you know how u and
v commute with the angular

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.412
momentum, you know how u
times v, in either the dot

00:04:22.412 --> 00:04:27.110
combination or the cross
combination, commute with j,

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.840
with L. So to say that
something is a scalar,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.380
the translation is that
Li with u dot v will be 0.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.630
You don't have to
calculate it again.

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.815
If you've shown that
u and v are vectors,

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:46.850
that they transform like
that, this commutes with this.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.200
So r-- so what do you
conclude from this?

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:59.840
That Li commutes with r squared,
commutes-- it's equal to p

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.070
squared.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.140
And it's equal to Li, r dot p.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.320
They all are 0.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.040
Because r and p are
vectors under rotation,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.910
so you don't have to
compute those ones anymore.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.290
Li will commute with r squared,
with p squared r cross p.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.620
And also, the fact
that u cross v

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.940
is a vector means that Li
commutated with u cross v,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:39.860
j-- the j component of u cross
v is ih bar, u cross v. I'm

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.900
sorry-- epsilon,
ijk, u cross v, k.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.560
Which is to say that u cross
v is a vector under rotations.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.920
This has a lot of
important corollaries.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.080
The most important
perhaps is the commutation

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.900
of angular momentum with itself.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.540
That is since you've shown
that r and p satisfy this,

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:17.790
r cross p, which is
angular momentum,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:20.100
is also a vector under rotation.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:27.640
So here choosing u
equal r, and v equal p,

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:37.485
you get that Li, Lj is equal
to ih bar, epsilon, ijk, Lk.

00:06:37.485 --> 00:06:39.310
And it's the end of the story.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.850
You got this commutation.

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.020
The commutation you wanted.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.470
In earlier courses,
you probably found

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.080
that this was a fairly
complicated calculation.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.690
Which you had to put the x's and
the p's, the x's and the p's,

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.040
and start moving them.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.800
And it takes quite
a while to do it.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.560
So, that's important.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.480
Another property
that follows from all

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:13.070
of this, which is sort of
interesting, that since L

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:19.116
is now also a vector under
rotations, Li commutes with L

00:07:19.116 --> 00:07:19.615
squared.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:33.850
Because l squared is L dot
L, therefore it's a scalar.

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:38.320
So Li commutes with L squared.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.100
And that property is
absolutely crucial.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.600
It's important that it's worth
checking that in fact, it

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.920
follows just from this algebra.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.490
You see, the only
thing you need to know

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:01.240
to compute the commutator
of Li with L squared

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.850
is how L's commute.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.070
Therefore it should be
possible to calculate this

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.750
based on this algebra.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:18.200
So this property is true just
because of this algebra, not

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.460
because of anything
we've said before.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.120
And that's important
to realize it.

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.140
Because you have
algebra like si,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:34.350
sj, ih bar, epsilon,
ijk, sk, which

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:37.440
was the algebra of
spin angular momentum.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.039
And we claim that
for that same reason

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:44.960
that this algebra
leads to this result,

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:50.700
that si should commute
with s squared.

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:55.540
And you may remember that
in the particular case

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.910
we examined in this
course, s squared--

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:06.520
that would be sx squared plus
sy squared plus sz squared-- was

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:12.260
in fact h bar over 2 squared.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.810
And each matrix was
proportional to the identity.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.780
So there's a 3 in
the identity matrix.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:23.750
And s squared is really in the
way we represent that spin,

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:29.050
by 2 by 2 matrices,
commutes with si.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.600
Because it is the identity.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.870
So it's no accident
that this thing is 0.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:41.220
Because this algebra,
whatever l is,

00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:47.940
implies that this with the
thing squared is equal to zero.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.550
So whenever we'll be
talking about spin angular

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:56.400
momentum, orbital angular
momentum, total angular

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.280
momentum, when we
add them, there's

00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.810
all kinds of angular momentum.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:05.610
And our another generic name
for angular momentum will be j.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:15.460
And we'll say that ji, jj,
equal ih bar, epsilon, ijk,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:20.485
jk is the algebra
of angular momentum.

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:29.200
And by using j, you're
sending the signal

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:31.906
that you may be talking about l.

00:10:31.906 --> 00:10:35.150
Or may be talking about
s, but it's not obvious

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:36.650
which you're talking about.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:41.320
And you're focusing on those
properties of angular momentum

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:49.320
that hold just because this
algebra is supposed to be true.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:54.460
So in this algebra, you will
have that ji commutes with j

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:55.100
squared.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:56.720
And what is j squared?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.850
Of course, j squared
is j1 squared

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:05.860
plus j2 squared plus j3 squared.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.560
Now this is so important,
and this derivation

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.300
is a little bit indirect,
that I encourage you all

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:16.230
to just do it.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.820
Without using any
formula, put the jx here,

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.930
and compute this commutator.

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:26.430
And it takes a couple of lines,
but just convince yourself

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:29.460
that this is true.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:38.580
OK, now we did have a
little more discussion.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.760
And these are all things
that are basically related

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.610
to what you've been
doing in the homework.

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.330
Another fact is
that this algebra

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:58.780
is translated into j
cross j equal ih bar, j.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:10.850
Another result in
transcription of equations

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:24.370
is that the statement that u
is a vector under rotations

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.900
corresponds to a
vector identity.

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:29.060
Just the fact that
the algebra here

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:35.460
is this, the fact
that l with u is this,

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.640
implies the following algebra.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:51.276
j cross u plus u cross
j equal 2i h bar.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.776
So this is for a
vector under rotations.

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:06.490
Under rotations.

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:09.760
So this I think is in the notes.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.380
It's basically
saying that if you

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:16.210
want to translate this equation
into vector form, which

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:20.370
is a nice thing to have,
it reads like this.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:24.280
And the way to do that is to
just calculate the left hand

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:24.780
side.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.500
Put and index, i.

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.050
And just try to get
the right hand side.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.360
It will work out.

00:13:34.130 --> 00:13:34.710
OK.

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.355
Any questions so far
with these identities?

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:49.330
OK.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.370
So we move on to
another identity

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:57.470
that you've been
working on, based

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:04.540
on the calculation of what
is a cross b dot a cross b.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:11.540
If these things are
operators, there's

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.020
corrections to the
classical formula

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:21.390
for the answer of of what this
product is supposed to be.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:26.990
Actually, the classical
formula, so it's not

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:33.820
equal to a squared, b squared,
minus a dot b squared.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:38.020
But it's actually equal
to this, plus dot dot dot.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.000
A few more things.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.960
Classically it's just that.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.640
You put 2 epsilons.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.240
Calculate the left hand side.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.080
And it's just these 2 terms.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:52.280
Since there are
more terms, let's

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.590
look what they are for a
particular case of interest.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:15:01.060
So our case of interest is L
squared, that corresponds to r

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.380
cross b, times r cross b.

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:12.780
And indeed, it's
not just r squared,

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:18.810
p squared, minus
r dot p squared.

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:21.610
But there's a little extra.

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:25.660
And perhaps you have computed
that little extra by now.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.258
It's ih bar r dot p.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:40.310
So that's a pretty
useful result.

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:43.925
And from here, we typically
look for what is p squared.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.280
So for p squared-- so what we
do is pass these other terms

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.180
to the other side.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:57.390
And therefore we have
1 over r squared,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:04.660
r dot p squared,
minus ih bar, r dot p.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.280
Yes.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.185
Plus 1 over r
squared, l squared.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.520
And, we've done this
with some prudence.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.620
The r squared is here in
front of the p squared.

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.415
It may be fairly different from
having it to the other side.

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:36.135
And therefore, when I apply
the inverse 1 over r squared,

00:16:36.135 --> 00:16:37.860
I apply it from the left.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:41.190
So I write it like that.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:42.970
And that's very
different for having

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:45.220
the r squared on the other side.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.550
Could be completely different.

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:52.010
Now, what is this?

00:16:52.010 --> 00:17:00.590
Well this is a
simple computation,

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:08.899
when you remember that p vector
is h bar over i gradient.

00:17:11.839 --> 00:17:21.956
And r dot p, therefore
is h bar over i, r, dvr.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.980
Because r vector is
r magnitude times

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.620
the unit vector in
the radial direction.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:36.550
And the radial direction
of gradient is dvr.

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.920
So this can be simplified.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.300
I will not do it because
it's in the notes.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:49.280
And you get minus h squared, 1
over r, d second, d r squared,

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.050
r.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:56.300
In a funny notation,
the r is on the right.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.750
And the 1 over r is on the left.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:03.990
And you would say, this
doesn't sound right.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.840
You have here all
this derivatives

00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.260
and what is an r doing to
the right of the derivatives.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.690
I see no r.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.775
But this is a kind of a
trick to rewrite everything

00:18:14.775 --> 00:18:17.010
in a short way.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:19.800
So if you want,
think of this being

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.753
acting on some function of r.

00:18:22.753 --> 00:18:24.420
And see what it is.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:28.560
And then you put a function
of r here, and calculate it.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.980
And you will see,
you get the same.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:35.770
So it's a good
thing to try that.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.930
So p squared is given by this.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:42.480
There's another
formula for p squared.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:49.470
p squared is, of
course, the Laplacian.

00:18:52.890 --> 00:19:01.530
So p squared is also
equal to minus h squared

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.730
times the Laplacian operator.

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:10.600
And that's equal to minus
h squared times-- in fact,

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:17.270
the Laplacian operator is 1
over r, d second, dr squared, r,

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:23.680
plus 1 over r squared,
1 over sine theta, dd

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.400
theta, sine theta, dd theta.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.380
It's a little bit messy.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:40.090
Plus 1 over sine squared
theta, d second, d phi squared,

00:19:40.090 --> 00:19:41.560
times closing this.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.955
So a few things
are there to learn.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:52.710
And the first thing is if you
compare these 2 expressions,

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.130
you have a formula
for l squared.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:02.310
You have l squared is 1 over
r squared on the upper right.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.790
And here you have minus h
squared times this thing.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:12.165
So l squared, that
scalar operator

00:20:12.165 --> 00:20:18.830
is minus h squared,
1 over sine theta,

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:26.380
dd theta, sine theta, dd
theta, plus 1 over sine

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:30.223
squared theta, d
second, d phi squared.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:40.905
So in terms of functions of
3 variables, x, y, and z,

00:20:40.905 --> 00:20:45.700
L squared, which is a
very complicated object,

00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:49.080
has become just a function
of the angular variables.

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.590
And that this a very
important intuitive fact.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.170
L squared.

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:55.280
L is operator.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.570
That's rotation.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:00.790
So it shouldn't really affect
the r, shouldn't change r,

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:02.710
modify r in any way.

00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:05.860
So it's a nice thing
to confirm here

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.900
that this operator can be
thought as an operator acting

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.050
on the angular variables.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:21.450
Or you could say, on functions,
on the units here for example.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:22.780
It's a good thing.

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.660
The other thing that
you've learned here--

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.620
so this is a very nice result.

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:32.170
It's not all that easy to
get by direct computation.

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:37.420
If you had to do Lx squared
plus Ly squared plus Lz

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:41.950
squared, first all this
possible order-- well,

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:43.770
there's no ordering
problems here.

00:21:43.770 --> 00:21:48.430
But you would have to write this
in terms of x, and py, and pz,

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:52.260
and xy, and z, then pass
to angular variables.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.380
Simplify all that.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.530
It's a very bad way to do it.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:21:59.240
And it's painful.

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.910
So the fact that we got
this like that is very nice.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.750
The other thing that we've
got is some understanding

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:10.100
of the Hamiltonian for a
central potential, what

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.360
we call a central
potential problem.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.305
v of r.

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.710
Now, I will write
a v of r like this.

00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:24.690
But then we'll simplify it.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:29.060
In fact, let me just go to a
central potential case, which

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:32.960
means that the potential just
depends on the magnitude of r.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.540
So r is the magnitude
of the vector r.

00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:44.220
So at this moment, you
have p squared over there.

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:50.120
So this whole
Hamiltonian is minus h

00:22:50.120 --> 00:23:02.850
squared over 2m, 1 over r, d
second, dr squared, r, plus p

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:04.080
squared over 2m.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:11.850
So 1 over 2m, r squared,
l squared plus v of r.

00:23:14.930 --> 00:23:19.506
So our Hamiltonian has
also been simplified.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.290
So this will be
the starting point

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:30.350
for writing the
Schrodinger equation

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:33.740
for central potentials.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:37.170
And you have the
operator l squared.

00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:41.930
And as far as we can, we'll
try to avoid computations

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:45.060
in theta and phi
very explicitly,

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.180
but try to do things
algebraically.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:53.500
So at this moment,
the last comment

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:56.980
I want to make on this
subject is the issue

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:01.790
of set of commuting observables.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:05.730
So if you have a
Hamiltonian like that,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:09.390
you can try to form a set of
commuting observables that

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:13.180
are going to help you
understand the physics

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:14.940
of your particular problem.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.140
So the first thing
that you would

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.310
want to put in the list of
complete set of observables

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.690
is the Hamiltonian.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:25.960
We really want to know the
energies of this thing.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.500
So what other
operators do I have?

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:32.960
Well I have x1, x2, and x3.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:42.950
And well, can I add
them to the Hamiltonian

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.880
to have a complete set
of commuting observables?

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.915
Well, the x's commute
among themselves.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.720
So can I add them?

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.930
Yes or no?

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:00.590
No.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:03.450
No you can't add
them, because the x's

00:25:03.450 --> 00:25:05.820
don't commute with
the Hamiltonian.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:07.660
There's a p here.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.180
p doesn't commute with x's.

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.750
So that's out of the question.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:15.500
They cannot be
added to our list.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.850
How about the p's?

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:20.690
p1, p2, and p3.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.240
Not good either,
because they don't

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:25.370
commune with the potential term.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:30.310
The potential has x dependents,
and will take a miracle for it

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.970
to commute.

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:32.370
In general, it won't commute.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:37.890
So no reason for it to commute,
unless the potential is 0.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:39.140
So this is not good.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:51.235
Nor is good to have r squared,
or p squared, or r dot p.

00:25:51.235 --> 00:25:56.870
r squared, p squared, r dot p.

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:58.620
No good either.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:05.440
On the other hand, r
cross p is interesting.

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.135
You have the angular
momentum, L1, L2, and L3.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:23.410
Well, the angular momentum
will commute, I think,

00:26:23.410 --> 00:26:24.950
with the Hamiltonian.

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.600
You can see it here.

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:34.990
You have p squared,
and Li's commute with p

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.050
squared because p is a
vector under rotations.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.900
p doesn't communicate with
Li, but p squared does.

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.580
Because that was a scalar.

00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:50.860
So this term commutes with
any angular momentum operator.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.350
Moreover, v or r, r is this.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:58.440
So a v of r is a
function of r squared.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.680
And r squared is the
vector r squared.

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:07.280
So ultimately, anything that is
a function of r is a function

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.650
of r squared that involves
the operator r squared,

00:27:10.650 --> 00:27:13.890
that also commutes
with all the Li's.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:17.170
So h commutes with all the Li's.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.490
And that's a great thing.

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.010
So this is absolutely important.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:27.390
h commutes with all the Li's.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:32.780
That's angular
momentum conservation.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:41.310
As we've seen, the rate
of change of any operator

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.450
is equal to expectation
value of the commutator

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:47.460
of the operator with
the Hamiltonian.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:54.960
So if you put any Li,
this commutator is 0.

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.250
And the operator is
conserved in the sense

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.870
of expectation values.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.580
Now this conservation
law is great.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.890
You could add this operators
to the commuting set

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:10.800
of observables.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.100
But this time, you have
a different problem.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.800
Yes, this commutes with h.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:18.945
This commutes with h.

00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:20.810
And this commutes with h.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.270
But these one's don't
commute with each other.

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:26.090
So not quite good enough.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.515
You cannot add them all.

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:33.750
So let's see how
many can we add.

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:35.640
We can only add 1.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.360
Because once you have 2 of
them, they don't commute.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:46.000
So you're going to add 1, and
everybody has agreed to add L3.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.590
So we have H, L3.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:56.630
And happily we have
1 more is L squared.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:01.430
Remember, L squared commutes
with all the Li's, so that's

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:02.240
another operator.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.010
And for a central
potential problem,

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:18.094
this will be sufficient to
label all of our states some.

00:29:18.094 --> 00:29:21.976
AUDIENCE: So how do we know
that we need the L squared?

00:29:21.976 --> 00:29:23.805
How do we know
that we can't get--

00:29:23.805 --> 00:29:26.986
how do we know that just
H and L3 isn't already

00:29:26.986 --> 00:29:30.142
a complete set?

00:29:30.142 --> 00:29:34.010
PROFESSOR: I probably wouldn't
know now, but in a little bit,

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:36.960
as we calculate
the kind of states

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.040
that we get with
angular momentum,

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:44.260
I will see that there are many
states with the same value

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:51.260
of L3 that don't correspond
to the same value of the total

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.920
or length of the
angular momentum.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:00.810
So it's almost like saying
that there are angular

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:07.360
momenta-- here is--
let me draw a plane.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:12.100
Here is z component of
angular momentum, Lz.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.360
And here you got it.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.210
You can have an angular
momentum that is like that,

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:20.400
and has this Lz.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.430
Or you can have an
angular momentum

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:28.750
that is like this, L prime,
that has the same Lz.

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:32.435
And then it will be difficult
to tell these 2 states apart.

00:30:32.435 --> 00:30:35.250
And they will correspond
to states of this angular

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.390
momentum, or this angular
momentum, have the same Lz.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:45.480
Now drawing these arrows is
extraordinarily misleading.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.640
Hope you don't get
upset that I did it.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.120
It's misleading because this
vector you cannot measure

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.080
simultaneously the 3 components.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.280
Because they don't commute.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.700
So what do I mean
by drawing an arrow?

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.780
Nevertheless, the
intuition is sort of there.

00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:05.450
And it's not wrong,
the intuition.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:08.950
It will happen to be
the case that states

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:16.320
that have same amount of Lz
will not be distinguished.

00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:21.530
But by the time we have this,
we will distinguish them.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:25.860
And that's also a peculiarity
of a result but we'll use.

00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:28.390
Even though we're talking
about 3 dimensions,

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:33.040
the fact that the 1 dimensional
Schrodinger equation

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.270
has non degenerate bound states.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:40.410
You say, what does that have
to do with 3 dimensions?

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:44.600
What will happen is that the
3 dimensional Schrodinger

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:48.180
equation will reduce to a 1
dimensional radial equation.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:53.100
And the fact that that
doesn't have degeneracies

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.630
tells you that for
bound state problems,

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:57.530
this will be enough to do it.

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:59.950
So you will have
to wait a little

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:01.970
to be sure that this will do it.

00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.120
But this is pretty much
the best we can do now.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.400
And I don't think you will
be able to add anything

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.370
else to this at this stage.

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:14.110
Now there's of
course funny things

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.660
that you could add
like-- if there's spin,

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.890
the particles have spin, well
we can add spin and things

00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:21.390
like that.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:26.930
But let's leave
it at that and now

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:32.090
begin really our calculation,
algebraic calculation,

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:36.260
of the angular momentum
representations.

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:40.370
So at this moment,
we really want

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:44.730
to make sure we work with this.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.075
Only this formula over here.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:04.470
And learn things about
the kind of states

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.160
that can exist in a
system in which there

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.570
are operators like that.

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:12.360
So it's a funny thing.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.810
You're talking about
a vector space.

00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.570
And in fact, you don't
know almost anything

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:20.200
about this vector space so far.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.780
But there is an action
of those operators.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:29.640
From that fact alone, and
one more important fact--

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.435
the j's are Hermitian.

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:42.690
From these 2 facts,
we're going to derive

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:49.420
incredibly powerful results,
extremely powerful things.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:55.970
And as we'll see, they
have applications even

00:33:55.970 --> 00:33:59.120
in cases that you would
imagine they have nothing

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:04.060
to do with angular momentum,
which is really surprising.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:08.949
So how do we proceed
with this stuff?

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:10.639
Well, there's a hermeticity.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:13.750
And you immediately
introduce things

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:22.290
called J plus minus, which
are J1 plus minus i J 2.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:26.278
Or Jx plus minus y Jc.

00:34:26.278 --> 00:34:33.409
Then you calculate
what is J plus J minus.

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:40.960
Well J plus J minus will be
a J1 squared plus J2 squared.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.120
And then you have
the cross product

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.502
that this doesn't cancel.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:35:01.561
So J plus times J minus would
be J1 plus i J2, J1 minus i J2.

00:35:01.561 --> 00:35:11.140
So the next term would
be minus i, J1, J2.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:15.400
And that's i h bar, J3.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:24.185
So this is J1 squared plus
J2 squared plus h bar J3.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:32.320
So that's a nice formula
for J plus, J minus.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.510
J minus, J plus would
be J1 squared plus J2

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:42.700
squared minus h bar J3.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:52.740
These 2 formulas are summarized
by J plus, J minus-- minus,

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:57.210
plus-- is equal to
J1 squared plus J2

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:01.120
squared plus minus h bar J3.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.520
OK.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.215
Things to learn from this.

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.440
Maybe I'll continue
here for a little while

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:22.960
to use the blackboards,
up to here only.

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:29.040
The commutator of
J plus and J minus

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:31.540
can be obtained
from this equation.

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.740
You just subtract them.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:37.820
And that's 2h bar, J3.

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:47.190
And finally, one last
thing that we like to know

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.600
is how to write J squared.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:37:01.930
So J squared is J1 squared
plus J2 squared plus J3

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:06.500
squared, which
then show up here.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:10.970
So we might as well
add it and subtract it.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:16.440
So I add a J3 squared, and I
add it on the left hand side.

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:19.400
And pass this term
to the other side.

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:29.010
So J squared would be J plus,
J minus, plus J3 squared,

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.890
minus h bar, J3.

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:40.741
Or J minus, J plus, plus
J3 squared, plus h bar, J3.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.730
OK.

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:47.110
So that's J squared.

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:56.240
OK.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:59.680
So we're doing sort
of simple things.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.130
Basically at this
moment, we decided

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:06.590
that we like better
J plus and J minus.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:09.390
And we tried to
figure out everything

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:11.870
that we should know
about J plus, J minus.

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:18.270
If we substitute Lx, and Jx,
and Jy for J plus and J minus,

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.080
you better know what
is the commutator

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:23.650
of J plus and J minus.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:28.000
And how to write J squared in
terms of J plus and J minus.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.640
And this is what
we've done here.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:35.910
And in particular, we have a
whole lot of nice formulas.

00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:39.515
So one more formula
is probably useful.

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:48.790
And it's the formula for the
commutator of J plus and J

00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:51.050
minus with Jz.

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:54.570
Because after all, the J
plus, J minus commutator,

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:55.450
you've got it.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.700
So if you're systematic
about these things

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.960
you should figure
out that at this I

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.165
would like to know what is
the commutator of J plus and J

00:39:05.165 --> 00:39:06.250
minus with Jz.

00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:12.720
So I can do Jz, J plus.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:13.840
It's not hard.

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.020
It's Jz.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:16.700
I'm sorry.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:17.990
I'm calling it 3.

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:21.370
So, I think in the notes
I call them x, y, and z.

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:24.550
But never mind.

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:28.910
J1 plus i, J2.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.330
The plus is really
with a plus i.

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:40.310
So J3 with J1 by the cyclic
ordering is ih bar, J2.

00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:52.670
And here you have plus i, and
J3 with J2 is minus ih bar, J1.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:40:02.770
So this is h bar, J1, plus i,
J2, which is h bar, J plus.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:09.290
So what you've learned
is that J3 with J plus

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:12.340
is equal to h bar, J plus.

00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:16.190
And if you did it
with J minus, you'll

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:20.580
find a minus, and
a plus minus here.

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:25.120
So that is the complete result.

00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:30.970
And that should remind you
of the analogous relation

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:35.130
in which you have in the
harmonic oscillator, N

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:38.160
commutator, with a dagger.

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.895
With a dagger.

00:40:39.895 --> 00:40:48.280
And N commutator
with a was minus a.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:52.120
Because of the fact that I
maybe didn't say it here,

00:40:52.120 --> 00:41:01.090
and I should have, that the
dagger of J plus is J minus.

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.190
Because the operators
are Hermitians.

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:06.890
So J plus and J minus are
daggers of each other,

00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:09.180
are adjoins of each other.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:11.770
And here you see a very
analogous situation.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.460
a and a dagger were
adjoins of each other.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.940
And with respect to N, a
counting number operator.

00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:21.160
One increased it.

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.160
One decreased it.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:28.690
a dagger increased the
number eigenvalue of N. a

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:31.580
decreased it, the same way
it's going to happen here.

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.260
J plus is going
to increase the C

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.290
component of angular momentum.

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:38.320
And J minus is going
to decrease it.

00:41:40.930 --> 00:41:41.920
OK.

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:47.380
So we've done most of the
calculations that we need.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.680
The rest is pretty easy work.

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:52.920
Not that it was
difficult so far.

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.970
But it took a little time.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:04.960
So what happens next
is the following.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.820
You must make a declaration.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:13.590
There should exist
states, basically.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.430
We have a vector space.

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:17.370
It's very large.

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:21.180
It's actually
infinite dimensional.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:24.360
Because they will be related
to all kinds of functions

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.620
on the unit sphere.

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.460
All these angular variables.

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:30.400
So it's infinite dimensional.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.810
So it's a little scary.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:37.130
But let's not worry about that.

00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:40.510
Something very nice happens
with angular momentum.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:44.330
Something so nice that
it didn't happen actually

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.370
with a and a dagger.

00:42:47.370 --> 00:42:49.650
With a and a dagger,
you build states

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:51.090
in the harmonic oscillator.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:54.510
And you build
infinitely many ones.

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:59.640
The operators x and p, you've
learned you cannot represent

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.830
them by finite
dimensional matrices.

00:43:02.830 --> 00:43:07.110
So this is a lot more
complicated, you would say.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:11.080
And you would say, well,
this is just much harder.

00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:15.480
This algebra is so much
harder than this algebra.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:21.850
Nevertheless, this algebra
is the difficult one.

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:25.182
Gives you infinite
dimensional representations.

00:43:25.182 --> 00:43:28.830
You can keep piling
the a daggers.

00:43:28.830 --> 00:43:31.670
Here, this is a
very dense algebra.

00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:36.190
Mathematicians would say this
is much simpler than this one.

00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:39.940
And we'll see the simplicity
of this one, in that you

00:43:39.940 --> 00:43:42.820
will manage to get
representations

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:45.400
and matrices that are
finite dimensional

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.550
to work these things out.

00:43:47.550 --> 00:43:51.170
So it's going to be
nicer in that sense.

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:54.315
So what do we have?

00:43:54.315 --> 00:43:58.400
We have to think of our
commuting observables

00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:02.650
and the set of Hermitian
operators that commute.

00:44:02.650 --> 00:44:11.450
So we have J squared, and J3--
I call it Jz now, apologies.

00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:15.040
And we'll declare
that there are states.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.850
These are Hermitian,
and they commute.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:22.040
So they must be
diagonalized simultaneously.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.150
And there should
exist states that

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.320
represent the diagonalization.

00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.720
In fact, since they commute,
and can be diagonalized

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:35.500
simultaneously, the
vector space must

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.930
break into a list of vectors.

00:44:37.930 --> 00:44:41.900
All of them eigenstates
of these 2 operators.

00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.930
And all of them
orthogonal to each other.

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.775
Matthew, you had a question?

00:44:46.775 --> 00:44:48.472
AUDIENCE: I was
just wondering when

00:44:48.472 --> 00:44:53.080
we showed that Jz is Hermitian?

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.660
PROFESSOR: We didn't show it.

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.400
We postulated that J's
are Hermitian operators.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:03.550
So you know that when J
is L, yes it's Hermitian.

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:08.760
You know when J is spin,
yes it's Hermitian.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.625
Whatever you're doing we'll
use Hermitian operators.

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:21.040
So not only they can
diagonalize simultaneously,

00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:25.830
by our main theorem about
Hermitian operators,

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:29.600
this should provide
an orthonormal basis

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.770
for the full vector space.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:36.390
So the whole answer is
supposed to be here.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:37.380
Let's see.

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:41.970
So I'll define
states, Jm, that are

00:45:41.970 --> 00:45:44.540
eigenstates of both
of these things.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:48.410
And I have 2 numbers to
declare those eigenvalues.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:52.300
You would say J squared.

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:56.970
Now, any normal person
would put here maybe h

00:45:56.970 --> 00:45:59.830
squared, for units,
time J squared.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:03.890
And then Jm.

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.360
Don't copy it yet.

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:14.070
And Jz for Jm.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:15.800
It has units of
angular momentum.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:19.650
So an h, times m, times Jm.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:25.900
But that turns
out not to be very

00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:29.590
convenient to put
the J squared there.

00:46:29.590 --> 00:46:31.660
It ruins the algebra later.

00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.780
So we'll put something
different that we

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:35.880
hope has the same effect.

00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.200
And I will discuss that.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:44.480
I'll put h squared,
J times J plus 1.

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:47.200
It's a funny way
of declaring how

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:48.760
you're going to
build the states.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.850
But it's a possible thing to do.

00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:56.910
So here are the states, J and m.

00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:59.660
And the only thing I
know at this moment

00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:02.430
is that since these are
Hermitian operators,

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.820
their eigenvalues must be real.

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:07.480
So J times J plus 1 is real.

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.890
And m is real.

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.470
So J and m belong to the reals.

00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:22.030
And they are
orthogonal to-- we can

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:25.290
say they're orthonormal states.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:29.430
We will see very soon that
these things get quantized.

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:34.590
But basically, the overlap of
a Jm with a J prime, m prime

00:47:34.590 --> 00:47:38.710
would be 0 whenever the J's
and the m's are different.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:45.460
As you know from our
theory, any 2 eigenstates

00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:48.070
with different eigenvalues
are orthonormal.

00:47:48.070 --> 00:47:51.020
And in fact, you
can choose a basis

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.670
so that in fact,
everything is orthonormal.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:57.050
So there's no
question like that.

00:47:57.050 --> 00:48:00.250
So let's explain a little what's
happening with this thing.

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:02.880
Why do we put this like that?

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.640
Or why can we get
away with this?

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.590
And the reason is the following.

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:19.470
Let's consider
Jm, J squared, Jm.

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:27.080
If I use this, J squared
on this is this number.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:31.980
And Jm with itself will be 1.

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:34.400
And therefore I'll put
here h-- I'm sorry.

00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:35.950
This should be an h squared.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:38.610
J has units of angular momentum.

00:48:38.610 --> 00:48:44.020
h squared, J times J plus 1.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:47.930
And I'm assuming that
this will be discretized

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:51.680
so I don't have to put the
delta function normalization.

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:56.030
At any rate, this
thing is equal to this.

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:59.300
And moreover, it's
equal to the following.

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:12.990
Jm sum over i, Jm, Ji, Ji, Jm.

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:18.950
But since J is Hermitian, this
is nothing but the sum over i

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:25.300
of the norm squared of
Ji with J acting on Jm.

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:31.250
The norm squared of this state.

00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:34.440
Because this times the
bra with Ji Hermitian

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.760
is the norm squared.

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:39.030
So this is greater
or equal than 0.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:43.370
Perhaps no surprise, this
is a vector operator,

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:47.010
which is the sum of squares
of Hermitian operators.

00:49:47.010 --> 00:49:49.600
And therefore it
should be like that.

00:49:49.600 --> 00:50:00.250
Now, given that, we have
the following-- oops--

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:07.200
the following fact that
L times L plus-- no.

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.270
J times J plus 1 must be
greater or equal than 0.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:16.050
J times J plus 1 must be
greater or equal than 0.

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:21.580
Well, plot it as a function
of J. It vanishes at 0.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:26.770
J times J plus 1 vanishes at
0, and vanishes at minus 1.

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:29.440
It's a function like this.

00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.270
The function J times J plus 1.

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:42.450
And this shows that all you need
is this thing to be positive.

00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:47.650
So to represent all the states
that have J times J plus 1

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:52.680
positive, I could label them
with J's that are positive.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.380
Or J's that are
smaller than minus 1.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:51:00.510
So each way, I can label
uniquely those states.

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:03.410
So if I get J times
J plus 1 equals 3,

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:05.930
it may correspond
to a J of something

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:08.720
and a J of some other thing.

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.250
I will have just 1 state,
so I will choose J positive.

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:17.080
So given that J times
J plus 1 is positive,

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:28.320
I can label states
with J positive, or 0.

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:32.720
So it allows you to do this.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:37.900
Whatever value of this
quantity that is positive

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:41.540
corresponds to some J positive
that you can put in here.

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:42.990
A unique J positive.

00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:48.450
So this is a fine
parametrization of the problem.

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:49.460
OK.

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:54.255
Now what's next?

00:51:56.925 --> 00:52:00.840
Next, we have to understand
what the J plus operators and J

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.360
minus operators
do to the states.

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:15.790
So, first thing is that J plus
and J minus commute with J

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:16.290
squared.

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.970
That should not be a surprise.

00:52:21.970 --> 00:52:24.160
J1 and J2 commute.

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:26.660
Every J commutes with J squared.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:29.970
So J plus and J minus
commute with J squared.

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:36.540
What this means in words
is that J plus and J minus

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:42.220
do not change the eigenvalue
of J squared on a state.

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:49.330
That is, if I would have J
squared on J plus or minus

00:52:49.330 --> 00:53:00.270
on Jm-- since I can move the J
squared up across the J plus,

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:02.220
minus-- it hits here.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:07.690
Then I have J plus
minus, J squared, Jm.

00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:12.330
And that's there for h
squared, J times J plus 1,

00:53:12.330 --> 00:53:15.080
times J plus minus on Jm.

00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:22.590
So this state is also a
state with the same value

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:25.040
of J squared.

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:39.410
Therefore, it must have the
same value of J. In other words,

00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:46.670
this state J plus minus
of Jm must be proportional

00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:50.350
to a state with J and maybe
some different value of m,

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:52.390
but the same value of J.

00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:53.860
J cannot have changed.

00:53:56.380 --> 00:53:57.570
J must be the same.

00:54:01.950 --> 00:54:10.280
Then we have to
see who changes m,

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.220
or how does J plus
minus changes m.

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.770
So here comes a little
bit of a same calculation.

00:54:17.770 --> 00:54:21.900
You want to see what is
the m value of this thing.

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:26.850
So you have J plus minus on Jm.

00:54:26.850 --> 00:54:32.630
And you act with it with
a Jz, to see what it is.

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:38.030
And then, you put, well,
the commutator first.

00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:46.830
Jz, J plus minus, plus J
plus minus, Jz on the state.

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:49.370
The commutator,
you've calculated it

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:53.770
before, was Jz with J
plus minus is there,

00:54:53.770 --> 00:55:01.490
is plus minus h
bar, J plus minus.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:04.360
And this Jz already act.

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:16.900
So this is plus h bar
m, J plus minus on Jm.

00:55:16.900 --> 00:55:20.350
So we can get the
J plus minus out.

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:32.180
And this h bar m plus
minus 1, j plus minus, Jm.

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:34.220
So look what you got.

00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:43.940
Jz acting on this state is
h bar, m plus minus 1, Jm.

00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:51.520
So this state has m equal to
either m plus 1, or m minus 1.

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.875
Something that we can write.

00:55:56.170 --> 00:56:02.510
Clearly-- oops--
in this way, we'll

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:08.370
say that J plus minus,
Jm-- we know already

00:56:08.370 --> 00:56:13.150
it's a state with J
and m plus minus 1.

00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:14.970
So it raises m.

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:19.630
Just like what we said
that the a's and a daggers

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:21.860
raise or lower the number.

00:56:21.860 --> 00:56:27.420
J plus and J minus
raise and lower Jz.

00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:30.940
Therefore, it's this is
proportional to this state.

00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:33.430
But there's a constant
of proportionality

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:36.080
that we have to figure out.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:41.140
And we'll call it
the constant C, Jm.

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:41.890
To be calculated.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.350
So the way to calculate
this constant-- and that

00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:59.870
will bring us almost pretty
close to what we need--

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:03.130
is to take inner products.

00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:07.980
So we must take the
dagger of this equation.

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:16.544
So take the dagger, and you get
Jm, the adjoin, J minus plus.

00:57:16.544 --> 00:57:19.280
And hit it with this equation.

00:57:22.690 --> 00:57:26.600
So you'll have here--
well maybe I'll write it.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.380
The dagger of this
equation would

00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:34.239
be C plus minus star of Jm.

00:57:34.239 --> 00:57:37.545
Jm plus minus 1.

00:57:41.490 --> 00:57:46.390
And now, sandwich
this with that.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:54.400
So you have Jm, J minus
plus, J plus minus,

00:57:54.400 --> 00:58:05.310
Jm equals to norm
of C plus minus Jm.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:08.900
And then you have this state
times this state, but that's 1.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:11.910
Because it's J, J,
m plus 1, m plus 1.

00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:13.910
So this is an orthonormal basis.

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:15.430
So we have just 1.

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:16.795
And I don't have to write more.

00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:24.770
Well the left hand
side can be calculated.

00:58:24.770 --> 00:58:26.925
We have still that formula here.

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:32.480
So let's calculate it.

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:43.070
The left hand side,
I'll write it like this.

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:50.140
I will have C plus
minus, Jm squared,

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:56.500
which is equal to the norm
squared of J plus minus, Jm.

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:01.196
It's equal to what?

00:59:01.196 --> 00:59:04.300
Whatever this is,
where you substitute

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:07.300
that for this formula.

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.270
So you'll put here Jm.

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:17.470
And you'll have--
well, I want actually

00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:20.040
the formula I just erased.

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:25.300
Because I actually would
prefer to have J squared.

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:34.020
So I would have this is equal
to J squared, minus J3 squared,

00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:39.030
plus minus h, J3.

00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:40.350
So let's see.

00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:42.820
I have the sign minus
plus, plus minus.

00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:45.560
So I should change
the signs there.

00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:58.490
So it should be J squared,
minus J3 squared, minus plus J3,

00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:05.010
and Jm, minus plus
h bar, J3, Jm.

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:11.540
So this is equal to h bar
squared, J times J plus 1,

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:18.000
minus an m squared,
and a minus plus.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.635
So minus, plus, minus here.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:29.000
I think I have it here correct.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.680
Plus minus 1.

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.060
And that's it.

01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:37.280
J squared is h squared this.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.430
J3 squared would give that.

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:43.830
And the minus plus here is
correctly with this one.

01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:46.080
So m should be here.

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.420
Plus minus m.

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:55.410
So this is h squared,
J times J plus 1,

01:00:55.410 --> 01:00:59.445
minus m, times m plus minus 1.

01:01:05.611 --> 01:01:06.110
OK.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:15.980
So the C's have
been already found.

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:21.730
And you can take
their square roots.

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:26.400
In fact, we can ideally
just take the square roots,

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:31.150
because these things
better be positive numbers

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:32.990
because they're norms squared.

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:36.270
So whenever we'll
be able to do this,

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:39.360
these things better
be positive, being

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:41.270
the square of some states.

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:47.940
And therefore the C plus
minus is-- C plus minus of Jm

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:53.980
can be simply taken to be
h bar, square root of J

01:01:53.980 --> 01:02:01.120
times J plus 1, minus
m, times m plus 1.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:05.290
And it's because of
this thing, this m times

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:11.980
m plus 1, that it was convenient
to have J times J plus 1.

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.040
So that we can compare
J's and m's better.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:20.310
Otherwise it would have
been pretty disastrous.

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:26.390
So, OK, we're almost done
now with the calculation

01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:27.330
of the spectrum.

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:32.110
You will say, well, we seem
to be getting no where.

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:34.600
Learned all these
properties, these states,

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:37.150
and now you're just
manipulating the states.

01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:39.180
But the main thing
is that we need

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:42.830
these things to be positive.

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:45.070
And that will give us
the whole condition.

01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:50.220
So, for example, we need
1, that the states J

01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:56.750
plus, Jm, their norm
squareds be positive.

01:02:56.750 --> 01:03:02.360
So for the plus sign-- so you
should have J times J plus 1,

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:07.480
minus m, times m
plus 1 be positive.

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:18.380
Or m times m plus 1 be
smaller then J times J plus 1.

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:26.960
The best way for my mind to
solve these kind of things

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.880
is to just plot them.

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:34.820
So here is m.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.025
And here is m times m plus 1.

01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:45.010
So you plot this function.

01:03:45.010 --> 01:03:53.810
And you want it to be less than
some value of J times J plus 1.

01:03:53.810 --> 01:03:57.050
So here's J times J
plus 1, some value.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:04:00.150
So this is 0 here.

01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:02.400
This function is 0 at minus 1.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.260
So it will be
something like this.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:15.400
And there's 2 values at which
m becomes equal to this thing.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:22.670
And one is clearly J.
When m is equal to J,

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:25.390
it's saturates an inequality.

01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:28.755
And the other one
is minus J, minus 1.

01:04:31.950 --> 01:04:34.910
If m is minus J,
minus 1, you will

01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:38.280
have minus J, minus
1 here, and minus J

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.920
here, which would
be equal to this.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:49.350
So, in order for these states
to be good, the value of m

01:04:49.350 --> 01:04:56.130
must be in between J
and minus J, minus 1.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:11.280
Then the other case is that
J plus on-- J minus on Jm.

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.760
If you produce those
states, they also

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.380
must have positive norms.

01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:22.260
So J times J plus 1, minus
m, times m minus 1 this time,

01:05:22.260 --> 01:05:23.940
must be greater than 0.

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:28.900
So m times m minus
1 must be less than

01:05:28.900 --> 01:05:33.990
or equal then J times J plus 1.

01:05:33.990 --> 01:05:39.550
And again, we try to
do it geometrically.

01:05:39.550 --> 01:05:43.420
So here it is.

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.880
Here is m.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.280
And what values do you have?

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:52.610
Well, if you plot here
m times m minus 1.

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.410
And that should be
equal to some value

01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:02.845
that you get fixed, which is
the value J times J plus 1.

01:06:06.370 --> 01:06:10.630
So you think in terms of
m's, how far can they go?

01:06:10.630 --> 01:06:15.900
So if you take m equals
J plus 1 that hits it.

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.890
So this is 0 here, at 1, at 0.

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:21.930
So it's some function like this.

01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:26.820
And here you have J plus 1.

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:30.800
And here you have
minus J. Both are

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:36.570
the places for m equal
J plus 1, and minus J

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:41.230
that you get the states.

01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:42.630
You get the saturation.

01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:45.670
So you can run m
from this range.

01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:51.210
Now, m can go less than
or equal to J plus 1,

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:57.000
and greater than or
equal to minus J.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.520
But these 2 inequalities
must hold at the same time.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:05.780
You cannot allow either one to
go wrong for any set of states.

01:07:05.780 --> 01:07:13.120
So if both must hold at the
same time for any state,

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:18.620
because both things have to
happen, you get constrained.

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:24.900
This time for the upper range,
this is the stronger value.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:28.220
For the lower range, this
is the stronger value.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:37.085
So m must go between J and
minus J for both to hold.

01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:41.840
Oops.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.340
To hold.

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:49.450
Now look what happens.

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:54.890
Funny things happen
if-- this is reasonable

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:58.410
that the strongest value
comes from this equation.

01:07:58.410 --> 01:08:01.800
Because J plus increases m.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.530
So at some point
you run into trouble

01:08:04.530 --> 01:08:06.680
if you increase m too much.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.370
How much can you increase it?

01:08:08.370 --> 01:08:12.610
You cannot go beyond J,
and that makes sense.

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:14.250
In some sense, your
intuition should

01:08:14.250 --> 01:08:18.330
be that J is the
length of J squared.

01:08:18.330 --> 01:08:20.899
And m is mz.

01:08:20.899 --> 01:08:26.810
So m should not go beyond J.
And that's reasonable here.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:32.930
And in fact, when m is equal to
J, this whole thing vanishes.

01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:37.350
So if you reach that state
when m is equal to J,

01:08:37.350 --> 01:08:42.920
only then for m equal to J,
or for this state, you get 0.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.790
So you cannot raise
the state anymore.

01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:55.700
So actually, you see if you
choose some J over here,

01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:58.390
we need a few things to happen.

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:03.620
You choose some J, and some m.

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:07.460
Well you're going to
be shifting the m's.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:12.830
And if you keep adding
J pluses, eventually you

01:09:12.830 --> 01:09:15.500
will go beyond this point.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:18.899
The only way not to
go beyond this point

01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:23.840
is if m reaches the value J.
Because if m reaches the value

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.029
J, the state is killed.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:32.229
So m should reach the value
J over here at some stage.

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:36.819
So you fix J, and you try
to think what m can be.

01:09:36.819 --> 01:09:40.069
And m has to reach
the value J. So

01:09:40.069 --> 01:09:43.939
m at some point,
whatever m is, you add 1.

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:44.689
You add 1.

01:09:44.689 --> 01:09:45.240
You add 1.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:50.260
And eventually you must
reach the value J. Reach

01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:52.370
with some m prime.

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:55.150
m here.

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:57.530
You should reach the
value J, so that you

01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:00.110
don't produce another
state that is higher.

01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:05.480
If you reach something before
that, that state is not killed.

01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.720
This number is not equal to 0.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:12.130
You produce a state and it's
a bad state of bad norm.

01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:14.080
So you must reach this one.

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:16.826
On the other hand,
you can lower things.

01:10:16.826 --> 01:10:22.320
And if you go below minus
J, you produce bad states.

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.700
So you must also,
when you decrease m,

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.370
you must reach this point.

01:10:27.370 --> 01:10:31.700
Because if you didn't, and you
stop half a unit away from it,

01:10:31.700 --> 01:10:34.570
the next state that
you produce is bad.

01:10:34.570 --> 01:10:36.190
And that can't be.

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:40.900
So you must reach this one too.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:44.120
And that's the key logical
part of the argument

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:57.881
in which this distance
2J plus 1-- no.

01:10:57.881 --> 01:10:58.380
I'm sorry.

01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:03.490
This 2J must be equal
to some integer.

01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:11.880
And that's the key
thing that must happen,

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:15.200
because you must reach this
and you must reach here.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.190
And m just varies by integers.

01:11:18.190 --> 01:11:21.630
So the distance between
this J and minus J

01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:23.750
must be twice an integer.

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:28.110
And you've discovered
something remarkable by getting

01:11:28.110 --> 01:11:30.980
to that point,
because now you see

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.230
that if this has to
be an integer, well

01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:37.230
it may be 0, 1, 2, 3.

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:41.440
And when J-- then J-- this
integer is equal to 0,

01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.910
then J is equal to 0.

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:46.760
1/2, 1, 3/2.

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:51.620
And you get all these spins
with-- consider particles

01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:53.790
without spin having spin 0.

01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:55.720
Particles with spin 1/2.

01:11:55.720 --> 01:12:00.110
Particles of spin 1,
or angular momentum 1,

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:03.690
orbital angular momentum 1.

01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:07.630
And both these things
have a reason for you.

01:12:07.630 --> 01:12:13.550
Now if you have 2J being
an integer, the values of m

01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:19.310
go from J to J minus
1, up to minus J.

01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:21.730
And there are two
J plus 1 values.

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:29.630
And in fact, that
is the main result

01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:33.080
of the theory of
angular momentum.

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:37.500
The values of the angular
momentum are 0, 1, 1/2, 3/2.

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:42.500
So for J equals 0,
there's just one state.

01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:46.090
m is equal to 0.

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:49.750
For J equals to 1,
there's two states.

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:52.710
I'm sorry for 1/2, two states.

01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:55.490
One with m equals 1/2.

01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:58.990
And m equals minus 1/2.

01:12:58.990 --> 01:13:01.890
J equals 1, there's
three states.

01:13:01.890 --> 01:13:05.570
M equals 1, 0, and minus 1.

01:13:05.570 --> 01:13:06.995
And so on.

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:12.440
OK.

01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.880
This is a great result.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:19.360
Let me give you an application
in the last 10 minutes.

01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:22.690
It's a remarkable application.

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:27.260
Now actually, you
would say, so what

01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:31.740
do you get-- what vector
space were we talking about?

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.770
And what's sort of
the punchline here

01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:38.802
is that the vector space
was infinite dimensional

01:13:38.802 --> 01:13:45.050
and it breaks down into
states with J equals 0.

01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:47.120
States was J equal 1/2.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.660
States with J equal 1.

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:51.580
States with J equal 3/2.

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:53.650
All these things
are possibilities.

01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:56.750
They can all be present
in your vector space.

01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:58.420
Maybe some are present.

01:13:58.420 --> 01:13:59.560
Some are not.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.560
That is part of figuring
out what's going on.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:08.980
When we do central
potentials, 0, 1, 2, 4

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:13.270
will be present for the
angular momentum theory.

01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:16.430
When we do spins, we have 1/2.

01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:20.260
And when we do other things,
we can get some funny things

01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:21.550
as well.

01:14:21.550 --> 01:14:25.170
So let's do a case where
you get something funny.

01:14:25.170 --> 01:14:27.390
So the 2D, SHO.

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:41.790
You have ax's, and ay's, and
a daggers, and ay daggers.

01:14:41.790 --> 01:14:45.100
And this should
seem very strange.

01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:48.710
What are we talking about
2 dimensional oscillators

01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:51.410
after talking about
3 dimensional angular

01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:53.730
momentum and all that?

01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:55.390
Doesn't make any sense.

01:14:55.390 --> 01:15:00.160
Well, what's going to happen
now is something more magical

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.090
than when a magician takes
a bunny out of a hat.

01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:08.780
Out of this problem, an angular
momentum, a 3 dimensional

01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:12.060
angular momentum,
is going to pop out.

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:17.210
No reason whatsoever there
should be there at first sight.

01:15:17.210 --> 01:15:18.210
But it's there.

01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:21.140
And it's an abstract
angular momentum,

01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.760
but it's a full
angular momentum.

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.570
Let's see.

01:15:29.450 --> 01:15:31.670
Let's look at the spectrum.

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:32.870
Ground state.

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:36.420
First excited
state is isotropic.

01:15:36.420 --> 01:15:43.010
So 2 states
degenerate in energy.

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:44.080
Next state.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.110
ax dagger, ax dagger.

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:51.210
ax, ay.

01:15:51.210 --> 01:15:53.924
ay, ay.

01:15:53.924 --> 01:15:57.620
3 states, degenerate.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:04.780
Go up to ax dagger
to the n, up to ax--

01:16:04.780 --> 01:16:07.570
no ax, or ax dagger to the 0.

01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:10.075
And ay dagger to the n.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:18.880
And that's n a daggers up to 0
a daggers, so n plus 1 states.

01:16:22.150 --> 01:16:27.440
3 states, 2 states, 1 state.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:32.650
And you'll come here
and say, that's strange.

01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:37.042
1 state, 2 states,
3 states, 4 states.

01:16:37.042 --> 01:16:41.790
Does that have
anything to do with it?

01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:44.370
Well, the surprise is it
has something to do with it.

01:16:44.370 --> 01:16:45.900
Let's think about it.

01:16:49.290 --> 01:16:56.470
Well, first thing is to put
these aR's and aL oscillators--

01:16:56.470 --> 01:17:02.650
these were 1/2, 1 over square
root of 2, ax plus iay.

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:12.960
And a left was 1 over square
root of 2, ax minus iay.

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:16.940
I may have-- no,
the signs are wrong.

01:17:16.940 --> 01:17:20.500
Plus and minus.

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.730
And we had number operators.

01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:26.960
n right, which were a
right dagger, a right.

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:33.798
And n left, which was
a left dagger, a left.

01:17:33.798 --> 01:17:37.350
And they don't mix a
lefts and a rights.

01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:42.890
And now, we could build a
state the following way.

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:44.720
0.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:50.900
a right dagger on 0.
a left dagger on 0.

01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:55.580
A right dagger squared on 0.

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:59.730
a right, a left on 0.

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:04.764
and a left dagger,
a left dagger on 0.

01:18:04.764 --> 01:18:10.060
Up to a right dagger
to the n on 0.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:18.840
Up to a left dagger
to the n on 0.

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:21.820
And this is completely
analogous to what we had.

01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:30.540
Now here comes the real thing.

01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:35.440
You did compute the angular
momentum in the z direction.

01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:45.360
And the angular momentum
in the z direction was Lz.

01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:50.330
And you could compute
this. xpy minus ypx.

01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:52.670
And this was all legal.

01:18:52.670 --> 01:19:00.763
And the answer was h
bar, N right, minus NL.

01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:09.320
That was the Lz component
of angular momentum.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:15.730
So, let's see what
Lz's those states have.

01:19:15.730 --> 01:19:22.660
This one has no n rights, or
n lefts, so has Lz equals 0.

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:28.270
This state has Nz equal h bar.

01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:32.580
And this has minus h bar.

01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:33.280
OK.

01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.450
h bar and minus h bar.

01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:39.330
That doesn't quite
seem to fit here,

01:19:39.330 --> 01:19:42.750
because the z component
of angular momentum

01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:46.060
is 1/2 of h bar, and
minus 1/2 of h bar.

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.950
That's-- something went wrong.

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:50.770
OK.

01:19:50.770 --> 01:19:51.810
You go here.

01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:54.796
You say, well, what is Lz?

01:19:54.796 --> 01:19:59.990
Lz here was h bar, minus h bar.

01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:06.140
Here is 2h bar, 0,
and minus 2h bar.

01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:11.210
And you look there, and say, no,
that's not quite right either.

01:20:11.210 --> 01:20:14.990
This-- if you would
say these 3 states

01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:18.350
should correspond
to angular momentum,

01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:24.160
they should have m equal plus 1,
plus h bar, 0, and minus h bar.

01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:25.490
So it's not right.

01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:29.400
OK.

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:35.180
Well one other thing maybe
we can make sense of this.

01:20:35.180 --> 01:20:41.640
If we had L plus, should
be the kind of thing

01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.640
that you can't annihilate.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.670
That you annihilate
the top state.

01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:51.840
Remember L plus, or J
plus, kept increasing

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:54.885
so it should annihilate
the top state.

01:20:54.885 --> 01:20:57.510
And I could try to
devise something

01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:59.780
that annihilates the top state.

01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:04.860
And it would be something
like aR dagger, a left.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:05.980
Why?

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:12.460
Because if aR dagger, a
left, goes to the top state,

01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:15.730
the top state has
no a left daggers,

01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:20.330
so the a left just zooms in,
and hits the 0 and kills it.

01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:21.450
Kills it here.

01:21:21.450 --> 01:21:27.020
So actually I do have
something like an L plus.

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:30.080
And I would have the
dagger-- would be something

01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:34.730
like an L minus-- would
be aL dagger, a right.

01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:37.630
And this one should
annihilate the bottom one.

01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:38.820
And it does.

01:21:38.820 --> 01:21:41.692
Because the bottom
state has no aR's,

01:21:41.692 --> 01:21:45.160
and therefore has no aR daggers.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:48.350
And therefore, the aR comes
there, and hits the state,

01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:49.820
and kills it.

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.930
So we seem to have more
or less everything,

01:21:52.930 --> 01:21:56.370
but nothing is working.

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:59.500
So we have to do a
last conceptual step.

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:05.150
And say-- you see, this
is moving in a plane.

01:22:05.150 --> 01:22:08.600
There's no 3 dimensional
angular momentum.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:12.470
You are fooling
yourself with this.

01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:17.730
But what could exist is an
abstract angular momentum.

01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:22.350
And for that, in
order to-- it's time

01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:26.920
to change the
letter from L to J.

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:30.770
That means some kind of
abstract angular momentum.

01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:36.020
And I'll put a 1/2
here, now a definition.

01:22:36.020 --> 01:22:41.670
If this is what I called Jz,
oh well, then thing's may

01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:42.800
look good.

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:52.570
Because this one for Jz has now
angular momentum 1/2 of h bar,

01:22:52.570 --> 01:22:55.480
and minus a half of h bar.

01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:01.940
And that fits with
this, these 2 states.

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:07.180
And with the 1/2, the
other ones, the Jz's, also

01:23:07.180 --> 01:23:09.310
have something here.

01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:15.220
So Jz here now becomes
h bar, minus h bar,

01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:16.225
and it looks right.

01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:22.880
And now you put the
1/2 here, and in fact,

01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:26.360
if you tried to
make these things

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:29.230
J-- call it J plus and J minus.

01:23:29.230 --> 01:23:32.920
Now you put a number
here, and a number here.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:36.160
If you would have
put a number here,

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:39.470
if you try to enforce
that the algebra be

01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:42.850
the algebra of angular
momentum, the number

01:23:42.850 --> 01:23:45.380
would have come out to be 1/2.

01:23:45.380 --> 01:23:50.040
But now we claim that in this
2 dimensional oscillator,

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.660
there is-- because
there's a number here

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.370
that works with this 1/2.

01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:56.900
Something you have to calculate.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:03.570
And with this number, you
have some sort of Jx, Jy, Jz,

01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:07.260
where this is like 1/2 of Lz.

01:24:07.260 --> 01:24:11.310
And those have come
out of thin air.

01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:14.590
But they form an algebra
of angular momentum.

01:24:14.590 --> 01:24:16.640
And what have we
learned today, if you

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.960
have an algebra of
angular momentum,

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:23.600
the states must
organize themselves

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:28.040
into representations
of angular momentum.

01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:34.910
So the whole spectrum of the 2
dimensional harmonic oscillator

01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:38.680
has in fact all spin
representations.

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:40.530
J equals 0.

01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:42.640
J equals 1/2.

01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.400
J equals 1.

01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.690
J equals 2.

01:24:46.690 --> 01:24:49.510
J equals n, and all of them.

01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:54.500
So the best example of
all the representations

01:24:54.500 --> 01:24:57.370
of angular momentum
are in the states

01:24:57.370 --> 01:25:00.960
of the 2 dimensional
simple harmonic oscillator.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:05.270
It's an abstract angular
momentum, but it's very useful.

01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:09.360
The one step I didn't do
here for you is to check.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:13.560
Although you check that
all of these Ji commute

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:15.920
with the Hamiltonian.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.360
Simple calculation to do it.

01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:21.620
In fact, the Hamiltonian
is NL plus N right,

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:23.130
and you can check it.

01:25:23.130 --> 01:25:27.470
Since they commute with them,
these operators act in states

01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:29.600
and don't change the energy.

01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:32.180
And they're a symmetry
of the problem.

01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:35.270
So that's why they fell
into representations.

01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:39.540
So this is our first example
of a hidden symmetry.

01:25:39.540 --> 01:25:42.890
A problem that there
was no reason a priori

01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:47.090
to expect an angular
momentum to exist,

01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:51.080
but it's there, and helps
explain the degeneracies.

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:53.880
These degeneracies you could
have said they're accidental.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.180
But by the time
you know they have

01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:59.760
to fall into angular
momentum representations,

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.180
you have great
control over them.

01:26:02.180 --> 01:26:05.100
You couldn't have
found different number

01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:08.090
of degenerate states
at any level here.

01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:11.270
This was in fact discovered
by Julian Schwinger

01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:13.535
in a very famous paper.

01:26:13.535 --> 01:26:16.910
And is a classic example
of angular momentum.

01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:17.500
All right.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:18.650
That's it for today.

01:26:18.650 --> 01:26:25.580
See you on Wednesday if
you come I'll be here.

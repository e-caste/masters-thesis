00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Today I want
to pick up where we left off--

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.770
well, to remind you where
we left off last time,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.520
we were watching videos
of crushing things

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.610
with the explicit purpose
of understanding material

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.422
properties, so that we can talk
a little bit about radiation

00:00:38.422 --> 00:00:39.630
damage and nuclear materials.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.980
Since I got more than
a few requests to say,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.040
what's all this
nuclear materials?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.440
It's like the biggest research
field in the department,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.450
and yet, it's not
talked about in 22.01.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.830
Well, now it is.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.800
So we talked before about
all the different stages

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.370
in radiation damage from
creation of single defects

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.360
to their clustering into
things like voids or loops

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.550
and super structures
that have end up

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.010
having macroscopic effects
on material properties,

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.920
and all of them is due to
the production of crystal

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.610
and defects due to radiation.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.290
And to refresh your
memory quickly,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.350
I'm going to jump ahead
to the stress strain curve

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.440
that we were looking at before
we started watching videos

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.925
of crushing things,
to remind you

00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:23.550
about the different
material properties

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.717
and what they actually mean.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:28.470
So anyone remember what we
mean by toughness in relation

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.470
to this curve?

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.720
AUDIENCE: The area [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.410
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.810
The amount of energy it
would take to actually cause

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.650
this material to fail.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.518
That's a measure of toughness.

00:01:38.518 --> 00:01:39.310
How about strength?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.730
Remember this curve is stress,
which is a force per unit area,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.623
versus strain, which is
an amount of elongation.

00:01:55.623 --> 00:01:57.290
The strength of the
material is how much

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.480
stress you can put
in until it starts

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.490
to either plastically
deform or it

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.420
hits its UTS, ultimate tensile
strength, where it will just

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.770
fail.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.090
How about ductility?

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.030
What do we mean by that?

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.010
Either intuitively or
on the curve, yeah?

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.930
AUDIENCE: How much
you can stretch it?

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.530
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.363
How much you can stretch
it before it fails,

00:02:18.363 --> 00:02:20.490
indicated by this
point right here.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.680
The strain to failure would
be a good measure of activity.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.750
And finally, stiffness.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.500
What do you think?

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.380
Stiffness is more of
a response function,

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.240
so it's how much does it deform
in relation to how much stress

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.930
you put into it.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.090
So it's the slope
of this part right

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.280
here, so that's why I
want you guys to know

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.290
that we mean actually
different physical things

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.190
by these properties, which
will be important to note

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.250
when we start to discuss what
radiation damage actually does.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.130
So the basic mechanism
of radiation damage

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.420
is like you might imagine.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.810
Let's say this green particle
is a neutron or a heavy ion

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.440
or a proton or an
electron or anything.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.680
Anything that's energetic enough
to cause atomic displacement.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.100
So as that neutron
or whatever enters,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.060
it will strike some of the
atoms in this perfect crystal,

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.390
creating what's called a
primary knock on atom, or PKA,

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.680
for short.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.620
And then that neutron
and the released PKA

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.680
will go on to hit
more and more atoms,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.410
resulting in what we
call a damage cascade,

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.653
leaving behind a lot of
different types of defects.

00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:31.570
We talked about these
last time, but I'll just

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.160
refresh your memory.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.190
A vacancy is a type of defect
that, well, it's not really

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.970
a thing, right?

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.950
It's just the absence of
where an atom would have been,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.850
but we refer to them
as defects of their own

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.310
that can diffuse and
move because let's say

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.360
another atom moved into the
position of this vacancy.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.800
Then we can say the vacancy
moved to that atomic position.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.510
There's also
interstitials, or atoms

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.730
where they shouldn't quite be.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.820
And this leaves behind
a whole bunch of damage

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.220
that we quantify using
a measure called DPA,

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.380
or displacements per atom.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.370
It's a simple measure of how
many times has every atom left.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.150
It's a lot of sight.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.590
That's it, though.

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.240
It's not actually
a unit of damage,

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.810
and I'll be giving
a talk at MRS,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.660
the materials research
conference tomorrow, railing

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.415
against this DPA
unit because I'm

00:04:23.415 --> 00:04:25.290
going to explain this
a little bit right now.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.630
What is a DPA?

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.210
A DPA measures the
number of times

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.360
that each atom has moved
out of its original site,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.810
but it has nothing to do with
how many times it stays out

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.870
of its original site
because a lot of those atoms

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.470
will get knocked away and
then just move right back,

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.360
but the DPA part
only measure is what

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.510
we call the ballistic
stage of radiation damage.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:52.840
Let's see if this works.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.090
I've just realized I
can jump back to a slide

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.080
without inducing epilepsy.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.290
Yeah.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.930
So what DPA actually measures
is how many times does

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.610
this process happen?

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.120
How many times do the
atoms get knocked around?

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.100
But it says nothing
about where they end up,

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.050
and that's the really
interesting part

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.010
about specifically
radiation material science.

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.070
Because let's say one
of these interstitials

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.200
were then to combine with
one of these vacancies.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.700
It's like they were never there.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.740
Even though they were
displaced, and would

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.250
be counted as part of the DPA,
or the radiation damage dose,

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.570
the net effect on the
crystal material is nothing.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.380
So let's say what
really the DPA is.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.290
It's a simple formula that I
think you guys may recognize.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.230
This look familiar
from all of neutronics

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:41.620
that we've been doing?

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.710
It's yet another reaction rate.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.130
It's an energy dependent
flux times another type

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.580
of cross-section that we
call the damage displacement

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.140
cross-section, or
sigma D, and it's

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.120
integrated over your
entire energy range,

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.600
and that's all there is to it.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.890
So with what you know 22.01, you
can understand the basic unit

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:00.480
of radiation damage.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.503
As you might imagine, we've had
four lectures on neutronics,

00:06:03.503 --> 00:06:04.920
so if you can
understand all there

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.630
is to know about DPA after
four sophomore lectures,

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.080
it's probably a
pretty simple unit.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.940
You're right, it is.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.550
What goes into this damaged
displacement cross-section

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.370
is also something that
might look a little familiar

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.680
is a cross section
that says, what's

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.790
the probability of some
particle coming in with energy E

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.590
and imparting kinetic energy
T to another struck atom?

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.510
That comes right from--

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.260
remember our treatment--

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.450
I think I've drawn this
probably 50 times now.

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.840
Our hollow cylinder treatment
of a charged particle

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.710
with charge little ze
interacting with a particle

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:49.310
a big ZE at some
impact parameter B.

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.810
We wanted to know well,
for all possible approach

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.270
paths, the area of
this hollow circle,

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.790
or the probability that
this particular approach

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:06.870
path is taken, is just
the area here 2pi b db.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:09.040
With some constants
in front of it,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.890
which actually is
that cross section

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.820
what's the probability that our
particle goes in with energy E

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.590
and imparts kinetic energy T?

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.240
It's directly related to
that impact parameter B.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.980
And this is the same thing
that you're seeing right here.

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:25.080
You then multiply by
this little function

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:30.310
nu of T, which represents
the amount of damage,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.320
or the number of
displacements done,

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:35.230
for each one of these reactions.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.560
And there are simple models,
there are mostly linear models

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.490
for--

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:43.180
if a particle comes in with
energy E, leaves with energy T,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.010
how many displacements happen?

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.940
It's a pretty simple
linear piece-wise model,

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.690
and that fairly
well approximates

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.320
the number of
displacements that happen,

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.810
but I want to get the
idea of DPA versus damage.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.270
They're two very
different things,

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.950
and they're often equated.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.980
Much like the material
properties of strength,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.150
ductility, hardness,
and toughness

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.740
are equated in
colloquial speech,

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.780
but that's absolutely wrong.

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:11.070
So is the idea of DPA
and radiation damage.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.480
Because DPA, again,
just measures

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.060
the number of times that
an atom is displaced.

00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:18.150
Damage is some measure of
the number of messed up atoms

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.650
at the end of the
game, and they operate

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:22.450
in very different timescales.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.240
It takes femtoseconds
to picoseconds

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.810
for a damage cascade to happen.

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:30.580
So the DPA is all over in
less than a picosecond,

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:33.820
but it can take years for
all these different defects

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.960
to diffuse, to cluster up, and
to form these super structures,

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.970
and actually end up
causing the damage that

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.710
can lead to material
property degradation.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.310
So what sort of
factors would affect

00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.920
the speed at which these
different defects end up

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.080
finding each other?

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.770
What could you vary about a
material or its environment

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.753
to change the speed of these
atomic diffusion jumps?

00:08:57.753 --> 00:08:58.670
AUDIENCE: Temperature.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.587
MICHAEL SHORT: Indeed.

00:08:59.587 --> 00:09:00.482
Temperature.

00:09:00.482 --> 00:09:02.690
Reading off my list-- well,
the whole list jumped up.

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.563
OK.

00:09:03.563 --> 00:09:04.480
You got the first one.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.522
What were you going to say?

00:09:05.522 --> 00:09:07.000
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say temperature also.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:07.640
MICHAEL SHORT: OK.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.348
Yeah, absolutely.

00:09:08.348 --> 00:09:11.030
Temperature determines
diffusivities.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:16.010
It also can change phases
or crystal arrangements,

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.730
like for the case of
anything iron-based.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.040
The dose rate, the rate at
which those neutrons come in

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.430
can change the rate at which
the defects cluster up.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:28.880
Chemistry, if you have solute
atoms, which I've drawn here.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.640
You may have let's say
chromium atoms and iron,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.710
and the chromium atoms
are a little bit bigger.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.680
Defects may be
attracted to or repelled

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.130
to those extra solute atoms,
changing the way that they

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.750
interact with each other.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.070
And then micro structure.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.460
Things that are bigger
than on the order of atoms.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.100
Grain boundaries, dislocations,
all of those defects

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.470
that we talked about last
time, just to refresh

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.250
your memory of what those are.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:58.370
We have been talking about
zero dimensional defects

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.080
like vacancies.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.350
We spent a while on
dislocations, these one

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.130
dimensional defects that other
defects can be attracted to.

00:10:08.130 --> 00:10:11.400
We saw an example of a
two dimensional defect,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.590
known as a grain
boundary, where you

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:18.340
can see this line between
different arrangements

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:19.930
of atoms.

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.450
And there can be three
dimensional defects.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.190
Like inclusions of some separate
face sitting in the material.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.250
Like the manganese sulfide we
found in the Alcator fusion

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.460
reactors power rotor.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.500
And all of the
presence and density

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:37.750
of all those
different defects can

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.480
be quite strongly influenced.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.168
Let me start that sentence over.

00:10:42.168 --> 00:10:43.960
The movement in clustering
of those defects

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.270
can be quite strongly
influenced by the presence

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:49.820
of all those other defects.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.550
So again, the DPA
actually tells us

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.830
this part of radiation
damage, and that's

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:58.400
what we tend to simulate
with these ballistic binary

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.140
collision approximation
simulations,

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:02.120
where we just say
like billiard balls,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.010
how many atoms knock
into each other?

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:06.770
What it doesn't tell
us is everything else,

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.710
and it's the stuff that
happens here that can tell us

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.980
will our materials fail
in nuclear reactors?

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.230
And there's evidence for this.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.820
I'm not just ranting
against it, no I am,

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.430
but I'm doing so with
evidence, so it's justified.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.180
So here's a nice
experiment I like to show

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.730
in every talk for this case.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:29.350
These folks took pure nickel
and put it in the same reactor,

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.350
at the same temperature, and
got the same amount of swelling.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.725
All the conditions
were the same.

00:11:35.725 --> 00:11:38.680
Same temperature, same
materials, same microstructure,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.990
same reactor, same
neutron energies.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.820
Just a different dose rate.

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:45.220
A 30% difference in
the rate at which

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.500
neutrons arrived at
the nickel, and they

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.600
get the same result
in void swelling, one

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.730
of those bad things
that happens,

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.070
at two and a half times
the DPA, which tells us

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.310
that there's a very
strong dose rate effect

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.257
for material damage.

00:12:00.257 --> 00:12:02.090
So if you want to answer
the question, well,

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:06.050
how much dose does it take to
reach 3% swelling in nickel?

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:09.050
Can't answer that question, you
don't have enough information.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:10.730
Even if you say, how
much dose does it

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:15.230
take with one of the neutrons
at 600 Celsius in this one

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.860
reactor?

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.720
You can't answer that question.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.750
Kind of tricky.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.470
And a lot of the rest of
nuclear materials data

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:22.620
looks something like this.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:25.520
Now, I don't want you to
worry about what the axes say.

00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.860
They're not readable because
they're not important.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:29.815
What I do want you to know is
what's the quality of this data

00:12:29.815 --> 00:12:30.440
set you see?

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:38.030
Would you be bold enough
to draw a trend line

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:40.670
through a single data point?

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.550
No.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.610
What about three where
it doesn't actually

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:46.960
match up with one of them?

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.910
Or is there any
reason why you think

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:51.847
they made this parabolic
instead of a linear line?

00:12:51.847 --> 00:12:53.930
I can draw a line that
would fit between the error

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:57.090
bars of these two right here.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.720
So the trick is doing these
experiments is extremely

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.730
difficult and expensive.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:05.450
So just throwing something near
the MIT reactor for a month,

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:08.630
because we did this, we took
a few hundred milligrams

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:11.000
of copper, aluminum,
and nickel, threw it

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.620
in near core position of the MIT
reactor, and that cost $40,000,

00:13:15.620 --> 00:13:19.810
and that did about 0.002
DPA, or about the dose

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:22.870
that you'd receive in a normal
power reactor in one day.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.850
If you want to actually
say how long will it

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.520
take to get materials to the
end of their useful life,

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.750
this tends to be anywhere from
10 DPA in light water reactors,

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:35.290
to hundreds of DPA in
proposed fast reactors

00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:39.410
to 500 DPA for TerraPower's
traveling wave reactor.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:41.490
Now, I don't particularly have--

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:43.840
let's see what's 500
divided by 0.00--

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:47.260
I don't have 10,000 years to
wait for the final answer.

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.660
The best we can do right
now is to stick them

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.548
in a reactor called
BOR-60 in Russia.

00:13:51.548 --> 00:13:52.590
I've actually been there.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:54.873
It's in the very Western
edge of Siberia--

00:13:54.873 --> 00:13:56.540
I don't know if you
could call it that--

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:58.600
in a city called Dimitrovgrad.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.173
They have a sodium
cooled fast reactor.

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:02.590
For those of you
who are wondering

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.548
when our advanced reactor
is going to be built,

00:14:04.548 --> 00:14:08.470
they are built. Just not in
this country, not very much.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.030
But Russia's got
a fleet of sodium

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:14.180
cooled fast reactors that
can get you 25 DPA per year.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:17.080
And if your reactor is
going to go to 500 DPA,

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.720
you have to know whether or not
your materials will survive,

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.920
you have to wait 20
years for the answer.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.920
So what investor is going
to be like, all right,

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.110
here's $10 billion,
but I can wait 20 years

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.730
for a return on investment.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:28.360
No.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.040
I can wait 20 years
to start building

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.480
the reactor, which
means 40 years

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.250
for a return on investment.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:35.380
Chances are, if someone's
got $10 billion to give,

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.760
they're going to be dead by
the time they get a return.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.565
So this is a no win proposition.

00:14:40.565 --> 00:14:41.940
So what we really
need to know is

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:45.900
what is the full population
of every single type of defect

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.640
in an irradiated material?

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.150
That's what I mean by damage.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.660
Did I show you guys
this movie yet?

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:54.510
The orange one?

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:57.190
We've talked about vacancies
in an abstract sense,

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.340
but this is a movie of
one of them actually

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.720
moving about on the
surface of germanium.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.410
So this is a scanning
tunneling microscope image--

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.970
I think that's what
it stands for--

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.870
and these are atoms on
the surface of germanium.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.360
And that right there,
that darker orange thing

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.130
moving about is
vacancy diffusion.

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:18.130
It's actually happening.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.315
You can see it in real time.

00:15:20.315 --> 00:15:21.690
AUDIENCE: Is this
real time then?

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.223
MICHAEL SHORT:
Pretty much, yeah.

00:15:23.223 --> 00:15:24.390
So I think this was-- yeah--

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.820
30 frames a second, or so.

00:15:26.820 --> 00:15:29.183
Anyway, I don't
remember exactly,

00:15:29.183 --> 00:15:31.350
but I'd say that's why I
always reference everything

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:32.225
in the presentations.

00:15:32.225 --> 00:15:33.695
I encourage you
guys to look it up.

00:15:33.695 --> 00:15:35.820
And then the only reason
these slides aren't up yet

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.195
is because they're
300 megabytes,

00:15:37.195 --> 00:15:40.050
and I didn't have the bandwidth
to upload that from my house.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.510
Now that I'm on campus, I can
get a 300 meg presentation

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.930
up there because
it's full of movies.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:50.050
What sort of things could
happen to these defects?

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:52.330
So radiation produces
all these crazy defects,

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:54.560
then the DPA
description is over.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:55.820
What could happen next?

00:16:00.104 --> 00:16:02.000
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.970
MICHAEL SHORT: Sorry,
Jared, and then-- yeah.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:05.270
AUDIENCE: Material could crack.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.770
MICHAEL SHORT:
Material could crack.

00:16:06.770 --> 00:16:08.548
That would be the
worst case scenario,

00:16:08.548 --> 00:16:10.340
but that is indeed what
happens in the end,

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.590
and I'll show you some pictures
of that actually happened.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.010
Yeah?

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.843
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that displaced atoms

00:16:14.843 --> 00:16:16.190
can find their way back?

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:17.360
MICHAEL SHORT: Yep.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:20.300
So they could recombine with
different types of defects

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.950
and annihilate each other.

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:24.683
If you have a vacancy and
an interstitial nearby,

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:26.100
the interstitial
can plug the hole

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:28.800
of the vacancy and your left
with another perfect crystal.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.820
But now what happens if two
vacancies find each other?

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.040
Then you've got the
makings of a void,

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.900
or we then call
it a small vacancy

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.540
cluster of two vacancies,
but it's actually

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:42.360
more stable for these
vacancies or interstitials

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.270
to find each other
and make these larger

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.550
defects than it is
for them to sit alone

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.970
in the crystal structure.

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:51.660
So there is a thermodynamic
driving force bringing them

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:55.200
together, and then as
those defects build up,

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.240
then what Jared
said could happen.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.000
You could crack the material
because it could get weaker,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.050
less ductile, less tough.

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:04.970
Weaker is the
opposite of strong,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.520
and what's the other one?

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.920
Toughness-- oh, and
harder, actually.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.569
So the origins
avoid swelling I'll

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.375
start with the humble vacancy.

00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:17.730
A void is nothing but
a bunch of vacancies

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.470
or a pocket of vacuum
or gas in a material,

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:24.359
and it all has to start
with these single vacancies.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:28.200
As they cluster together,
they reached this threshold

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.960
in terms of free energy
where putting a few of them

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.720
together is not quite
energetically favorable,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.720
but it's not so unfavorable
that it never happens.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.930
So once in a while, you'll get a
few vacancies to come together,

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.110
and that cluster will
survive for a little while.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:46.170
All the while, you're making
more and more vacancies nearby,

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.610
and if it gets to
a certain size,

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.915
that free energy goes negative.

00:17:49.915 --> 00:17:51.540
And when the free
energy goes negative,

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.960
it becomes stable on its
own, and then that void

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.360
will simply continue to
grow, and grow, and grow.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.130
And so there's this process
of absorption and emission

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.260
of defects by larger
or smaller void,

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:06.790
so if you have a whole bunch
of voids near each other,

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.610
some of them can be
emitting vacancies,

00:18:08.610 --> 00:18:10.422
which can be captured
by the other ones,

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.630
and this is part of why they
don't all just disappear

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:13.530
at once.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.540
They have finite
lifetimes, long enough

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.670
that you can build
them up to the size

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.110
where they become stable.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.250
Then this free energy eventually
curves down, becomes negative,

00:18:23.250 --> 00:18:26.840
and then they just stick
around, and we've actually

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.760
seen these clusters
or voids diffusing,

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.380
so it's not like vacancies alone
are the only thing that moves.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:37.850
We've actually seen clusters
of defects diffusing, mostly

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:40.130
in one dimension, but
what you're seeing here

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.400
is a TEM, or transmission
electron microscope image,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.580
of one dimensional diffusion
of a vacancy cluster.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.650
That little black
blob right there

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:52.080
is a pocket of vacuum that's
moving back and forth.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.320
And if it happens to find
another pocket of vacuum,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.110
it could then combine
to a bigger pocket,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:19:01.000
becoming a bigger
and bigger void.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.520
The other problem too
is that most materials

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:07.420
generate helium when you
irradiate them with neutrons.

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.780
Did we go over the what's called
the N alpha cross-section?

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.777
Does that sound
familiar to anyone?

00:19:14.777 --> 00:19:16.360
All right, I'm going
to pull up Janice

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.080
like I do pretty
much every class.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.360
Let me show you what's going on.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.570
But this is an
important one to note.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:29.780
Because a pocket a vacuum
is not that stable,

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.220
but if you get a
little bit of gas

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.262
to stabilize that
pocket of vacuum,

00:19:33.262 --> 00:19:34.970
then that pressure
differential goes down

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:38.710
and that void becomes a bubble,
and that bubble is more stable.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:39.210
Good.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:40.490
Because on the
last isotope, where

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:42.115
I was showing someone
[INAUDIBLE] alpha

00:19:42.115 --> 00:19:43.190
cross-section.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.280
How convenient.

00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.460
So among the millions
of cross sections

00:19:47.460 --> 00:19:49.620
that we've gone through,
there is this one right

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.420
here called Z alpha.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:53.720
So what-- Yeah?

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.087
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:57.087 --> 00:19:58.750
MICHAEL SHORT: Got
to clone the screen.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.292
That's right.

00:19:59.292 --> 00:20:01.620
Thanks.

00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:02.700
There we go.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.100
So there's this one here
called Z alpha, which

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.670
means neutron comes in,
alpha particle goes out,

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:10.830
alpha particle is
just an ionized helium

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:13.950
ion, which very quickly
pulls in two electrons

00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:17.430
from anywhere else in the
metal and becomes helium gas.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.780
And this cross-section
is not zero,

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:24.830
especially at higher energy
starting around 2 MeV,

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.470
there is a small, but
non-negligible chance

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:30.902
that a neutron will go in,
and a helium atom comes out.

00:20:30.902 --> 00:20:32.360
And those helium
atoms have nowhere

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.270
to go, they find the
easiest place to sit,

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.820
that happens to be
pockets of vacuum.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.170
Voids.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:42.710
And what that actually does
is stabilizes those voids so

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.170
the curve I showed
you back here.

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:50.650
This is the case of free energy
for a vacuum pocket of void,

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.000
and that free energy gets
lower and lower as you start

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.640
to fill that void with gas.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.430
So as the voids
fill with gas, they

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.950
become more and more stable,
and a lot of materials

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.910
generate their own gas.

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:08.232
So that's that, and they end
up forming these bubbles.

00:21:08.232 --> 00:21:10.690
You guys remember, last time
I showed you a bunch of voids.

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:13.358
They look like diamonds all
aligned in the same direction.

00:21:13.358 --> 00:21:14.650
What do you see different here?

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.600
They're not quite
circles, right?

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.110
But they're kind of
round edge squares.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.300
They are also all pointing
in the same direction.

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.630
If you look carefully
at this one,

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.175
this one, the one above it.

00:21:32.175 --> 00:21:33.300
And the big one over there.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.900
It's harder to see
for the small ones,

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.960
but for these
three big ones, you

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.420
can see that they're all
rotated in the same direction,

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.090
giving away the crystal
orientation of the material.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:43.590
But the reason that
they're starting

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:47.840
to swell up from diamonds into
bubbles, is they're full of gas

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.670
and they stabilize the voids.

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.310
You can also get
dislocation buildup.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.010
Normally, you would have
to deform a material

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.910
to create and move dislocations,
but when you apply radiation,

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:03.727
you can just create
dislocations.

00:22:03.727 --> 00:22:04.560
I mean look at that.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:05.820
This is kind of cool.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.460
You've got a dislocation
source right here.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.560
Every one of those lines
you see is a dislocation,

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:13.530
and you can see it's spiraling
out and ejecting dislocations

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:15.360
from this one little spot.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.210
Any combination
of small clusters

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.810
can collapse into dislocations
or the stress induced

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:24.330
from irradiating things
can cause more stress that

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:26.088
can move more dislocations.

00:22:26.088 --> 00:22:27.630
You create what's
called this network

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:30.030
forest of dislocations
that makes

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.890
things a lot harder to deform.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.710
So let's see, I want to show
a couple more videos of this

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:40.200
because it's very
clear in some of these.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.860
You can actually see along
these lines right here

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:46.830
a few different orientations
of dislocations,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:50.380
and if you watch
up here, you can

00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:52.420
see some dislocations
moving, and then

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.650
there's a source that
emits more right there,

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.517
and so all the time, you're
creating dislocations

00:22:57.517 --> 00:22:59.350
that are being emitted
from different places

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.433
and colliding with each other.

00:23:01.433 --> 00:23:03.100
The trick that we
didn't talk about yet,

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.290
is when dislocations
from different directions

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:07.720
collide, they get stuck.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.930
And when they get
stuck, they can't move.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.350
And when they can't move, you
shift the balance from slip

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:16.210
to fracture, which
means, like Jared said,

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.840
it's easier to just break
something, rather than

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.150
plastically deform it.

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:26.360
And the effects of this
are things like stiffening.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.730
An increase in the
Young's Modulus.

00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:31.130
Because if you remove
some of the compliance

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.613
from the material or make
it stiffer by injecting

00:23:33.613 --> 00:23:35.030
all sorts of
different defects, it

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:38.872
takes more stress to
impart the same strain.

00:23:38.872 --> 00:23:40.580
That might not be a
bad thing on its own.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.038
Your materials get stronger,
that sounds like a good thing,

00:23:43.038 --> 00:23:44.470
right?

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:49.498
Not always because it doesn't
just come as stiffening.

00:23:49.498 --> 00:23:51.040
But now from an
atomic point of view,

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.140
why does this stiffening happen?

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.070
Anybody have an idea?

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.450
I'm going to jump back to
the stress strain curve.

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:06.580
So the stress, or the
yield stress of a material,

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:09.160
is usually defined as
this point right here.

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.370
When you go from elastic
reversible deformation

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.980
to irreversible
plastic deformation.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.480
If something gets
stronger, it means

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.300
that this yield stress goes up.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.450
And if something gets stiffer,
it means the slope goes up.

00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:25.230
These two tend to
happen at the same time.

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:28.070
So if something is
stiffer and stronger, then

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.520
the stress strain curve would
be drawn more like that.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.120
And what actually physically
happens at this point?

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.020
This is when dislocations
start to move.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.160
Dislocation movement
is irreversible.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.660
You can't just snap it back
when you relieve the stress.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.270
And by making something
stronger and stiffer,

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.370
you make it more difficult
for those dislocations

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:50.050
to start moving.

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:53.080
And you can do that by throwing
any defect in their way.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.630
And since radiation creates
pretty much any and all

00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:58.568
defects, it's a great way
to stiffen and strengthen

00:24:58.568 --> 00:24:59.110
the material.

00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:07.460
So one of the reasons things
get stiffer and stronger

00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:10.340
is, remember before we showed
you that video of dislocation

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.805
sliding through material?

00:25:13.805 --> 00:25:14.680
Folks don't remember.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.290
I'll bring it up right now.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:18.790
I didn't see a lot
of shaking heads.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:25.240
This one, right?

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.820
This one right here.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:28.240
So remember, before,
we showed you

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.840
the way that dislocations move.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.950
So the ways that materials
can deform without breaking.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.040
If you throw
anything in its way,

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.100
you're going to make this
process a lot more difficult.

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.880
And all radiation damage does
is throw things in the way.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:47.280
So if you throw
absolutely anything

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:52.888
in the way from solute atoms
to interstitials to vacancies,

00:25:52.888 --> 00:25:54.930
all of a sudden, it's
harder for that dislocation

00:25:54.930 --> 00:25:57.180
to move because some of those
bonds are stretched out,

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.550
or there's a few extra
atoms in the way.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:02.280
And you can then
start to create what's

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.300
called little pin
sections called jogs.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.390
Let's say a little vacancy
moves over to this dislocation,

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:12.210
meaning that it goes up
by one atomic position.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:14.340
Then you've got pieces
of this dislocation that

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:19.417
are not in this preferential
slip plane, and they get stuck.

00:26:19.417 --> 00:26:21.625
So all of a sudden you go
from a completely gliding--

00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:23.700
or what we call
glissile dislocation--

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.950
to one that's stuck,
or sessine, those

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.630
are the actual material
science words that we use.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:32.280
And what it ends up leading to
is a strong loss in ductility.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:36.090
At the same time as things
get stronger and stiffer,

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:38.070
they tend to get
much less ductile.

00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:41.970
So what you're looking
at here are fuel shrouds.

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:45.810
These are fuel boxes that
surround the fuel pins

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:48.725
in a Russian sodium fast
reactor, and usually

00:26:48.725 --> 00:26:50.850
what you do is you would
grab onto this piece right

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:53.940
here and lift up to remove
this fuel from the reactor

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.320
during refueling.

00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.040
What happened here is they grab
that, they started to pull,

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.610
and they heard a little clink,
and up came half the fuel box,

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:05.040
and the fuel stayed down
in the reactor with no way

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:06.660
to pull it out.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:09.270
So this is the reason why
radiation damage is such

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:11.550
an important field of
study is you might not

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:14.730
know anything has happened
until you shut the reactor down

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.460
and go to take out
the fuel and realize

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.180
that you can't
because everything

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:20.040
is as brittle as glass.

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:23.100
This is actually a
talk I saw yesterday.

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.430
We had a summer visitor in
our lab from Kazakhstan.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.518
And most of their
radioactive materials

00:27:28.518 --> 00:27:30.060
came from this
reactor that shut down

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.080
in 1999 on one
side of Kazakhstan,

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.150
and they wanted to
transport those materials

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:37.590
to the other side.

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.840
So they hired the
cheapest truck drivers

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.580
to go on the bumpy roads.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.700
And the scientists were
freaking out, because only

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:47.873
they knew that all of the metal
that all those guys thought

00:27:47.873 --> 00:27:49.290
was going to be
ductile like metal

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.300
was more brittle than glass.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:55.890
And any sort of bump would
cause just complete shattering

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.090
of this metal and
catastrophic release

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:01.920
of radioactive material.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.510
So this took them--

00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:06.510
let's see-- I think Kazakhstan
is smaller than the US.

00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:09.780
So who here has done
a cross-country trip?

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.850
How long it take you?

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:12.807
AUDIENCE: Six days
from Seattle to here.

00:28:12.807 --> 00:28:14.890
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, and did
you stop along the way?

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.515
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:28:15.515 --> 00:28:18.080
MICHAEL SHORT: OK, so this
trip took them 13 days

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:19.940
because they went slow.

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:21.818
And I don't think the
roads in Kazakhstan

00:28:21.818 --> 00:28:24.360
are as good as they are in most
of the middle of the country.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.950
The coasts are terrible, but
the middle is pretty good.

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.260
So this trip went slow
because the scientists

00:28:30.260 --> 00:28:31.980
said this happens.

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:32.917
You should be careful.

00:28:32.917 --> 00:28:35.000
And luckily, there were
no problems and no release

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.890
of radioactive material.

00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:39.320
Pretty cool.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.930
What you want to happen
is for dislocations

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.640
to move on the easiest planes.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.460
And so what I have
redrawn here is,

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.770
let's say you've got
a bar of some metal,

00:28:48.770 --> 00:28:53.540
some face-centered cubic metal,
as you pull on it, like this,

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:57.440
it will actually deform at
about a 45 degree angles.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.967
You might wonder,
why does that happen?

00:28:59.967 --> 00:29:01.550
But if you look
carefully here, what's

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:04.850
the closest packed plane
of atoms that you can see?

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.150
It's not this plane normal
to the stress direction.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:11.390
It's like this one
or like this one,

00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:13.760
and so you actually end
up getting deformation

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.000
in what's called slip plains,
or the easiest directions

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.570
for things to deform.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.870
And without going into any
of the math or atomistics,

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.120
I just want to show you
some examples pulled out

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:25.040
of, again, the fusion reactor.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:28.690
So this is a piece of rotor
steel from the same Alcator

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.950
rotor where we found
that inclusion.

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.410
We were pulling it in
this direction, and look

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:34.850
what formed.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.815
All of these slip bands
at 45 degree angles,

00:29:38.815 --> 00:29:40.190
showing you that
just because you

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:41.690
pull in something
in one direction,

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:44.090
doesn't mean it deforms
in that direction.

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:47.180
It deforms and little
slices in the direction

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:49.755
that dislocations
can move the easiest.

00:29:49.755 --> 00:29:51.380
So when you actually
pull on something,

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.590
to show you diagrammatically,
it deforms something like that.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.250
You get a mixture of
bending and rotation

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.570
to make it look like the bar
is bending uniformly straight,

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:04.930
but on the microscale, it's not.

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:08.190
So this is a pretty slick image
of a single crystal of cadmium

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:11.700
being pulled in this
direction, and you can actually

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.300
see every plane there,
that's a slip plane.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.710
That's a plane
where dislocations

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:20.055
have been moving all the way
to the outside of the material,

00:30:20.055 --> 00:30:21.930
which is pretty cool,
and this is the process

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:24.120
that you want to happen.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.490
Anything in the way
of those dislocations,

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:28.680
you don't start forming
these slip bands,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.050
and you'd make it more
preferable that the thing will

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.500
just break and fracture.

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:36.440
To show you some extreme
examples of slip,

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.330
that's when you have to go nano.

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.360
So these are some
pillar compression test

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.260
that used a focused
ion beam, which

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:45.260
we will be using to top
off our study of electron

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:48.080
interactions with matter
and ion interactions

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.220
to take a piece of metal and
carve out a little cylinder.

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:54.020
And all they did is smash.

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:57.290
They came down and compressively
pushed on the cylinder,

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.250
and look how it deformed.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.980
Not in the way you might
intuitively expect,

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.440
if you don't know
any material science.

00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.750
So it deformed all
on 45 degree angles

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:10.200
and very weird compression.

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.553
Not actually weird, if
you know what's going on.

00:31:13.553 --> 00:31:15.220
there's lots more
neat examples of this.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.590
If you don't push too
hard, you can actually

00:31:17.590 --> 00:31:21.880
see these perfectly symmetrical
slip planes at 45 degree angles

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.870
to the axis of
compression, and you

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:27.040
know every one of these
pillars you see this happening.

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.605
And this is what you want to
happen to nuclear materials

00:31:30.605 --> 00:31:32.230
because you're really
trying to balance

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:37.045
this between slip and fracture
towards the direction of slip.

00:31:37.045 --> 00:31:39.545
That means that something will
deform a little bit before it

00:31:39.545 --> 00:31:45.338
just shatters like those channel
boxes from the Russian reactor.

00:31:45.338 --> 00:31:46.880
Any questions on
what I said before I

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.071
go on to the
macroscale properties?

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:55.410
All right, and let's get
into the real world stuff.

00:31:55.410 --> 00:31:57.900
What actually causes
this embrittlement?

00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.000
Well, there's a few things.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.600
Remember we saw videos of those
dislocations in a traffic jam.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.210
If not, then I'll refresh
your guy's memory.

00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:13.430
It's a phenomenon called
pileup, let's see.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:16.850
There is the traffic jam.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:18.570
Do you guys remember
this video now--

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.850
I know it's been a week,
but these dislocations

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:24.430
are moving and feeling
each other's stress,

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:27.340
and so they can't move as
easily as they would want to,

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:29.710
so you end up with a
phenomenon called pileup.

00:32:29.710 --> 00:32:33.250
This happens both near
other dislocations

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.860
and near any other defect
that gets in the way,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.520
like a grain boundary.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.980
So for smaller materials you
end up with more of this pileup,

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:49.050
and they tend to be of a fair
bit stronger, and a fair bit--

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.680
they can be less ductile,
with some exceptions.

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.438
I won't say they're
always less ductile,

00:32:53.438 --> 00:32:55.230
but if you put anything
in the way, notice,

00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:57.180
this just says barrier.

00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:00.250
Any other defect can
act as a barrier.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:01.710
And this ends up
shifting what we

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:05.070
call the ductile-brittle
transition temperature.

00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:07.260
This is the property
that people worry

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:09.670
about for reactor
pressure vessels,

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:12.310
because you would want the
pressure vessel, which in cases

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:15.040
the entire core of
the reactor, to always

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:18.870
be ductile in the worst
possible situation.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:21.990
The worst possible situation
is on the absolute last day

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:24.600
of operation at the
coldest temperature

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.400
it could possibly be.

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.040
As you guys know, or
you probably know,

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.620
when you make something colder,
it tends to be more brittle.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:35.130
So who's frozen stuff in liquid
nitrogen and broken it before?

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:35.630
Good.

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.010
I'm glad to see a
few hands, so what

00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:38.218
do you guys freeze and break?

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:45.790
So just like froze a bottle of
Pepto Bismol and shattered it?

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:46.570
Nice.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.973
That must have been a
fun mess to clean up.

00:33:48.973 --> 00:33:50.140
Yeah, what about you, Sarah?

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.290
AUDIENCE: A banana and a coin.

00:33:52.290 --> 00:33:53.300
MICHAEL SHORT: Cool, OK.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.180
And we're able to
break the coin?

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.110
There you go.

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:58.720
So normally you'd be
able to bend a coin,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:01.390
or if it's a one yen coin,
you can bite through it.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.760
Not when immersed in liquid
nitrogen. What about you,

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:04.480
Charlie?

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.230
AUDIENCE: Flowers.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.890
MICHAEL SHORT: Flowers, OK.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:06.400
Classic.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.710
So take a rose and shatter it.

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:09.489
Yeah.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:12.909
All these normally ductile
materials become extremely

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:14.320
brittle when they get colder.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.330
So do reactor pressure vessels.

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:18.190
The problem is, they
don't just get brittle

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.290
when they get to liquid
nitrogen temperatures.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:21.707
At the end of their
life, they can

00:34:21.707 --> 00:34:25.030
be brittle at room temperature
from radiation damage.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:27.280
So there is what's called a
ductile-brittle transition

00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.570
temperature before a pressure
vessels are irradiated,

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:35.050
there's about this 50% line,
whatever this temperature was

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:38.650
where you have let's say,
50%, or 10%, or 0% ductility.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.420
Whatever measure
you're using, you

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.190
say, OK, we always
want to make sure

00:34:42.190 --> 00:34:45.219
that it's got a certain
amount of energy absorption

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:49.159
capability, toughness,
at a certain temperature.

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.159
And as you irradiate
that vessel,

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:55.810
this shifts over this way, and
this upper amount of energy,

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:58.240
this USE, or what we
call upper shelf energy,

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:01.650
because this looks like
a shelf, goes down.

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:04.990
What you want to make
sure is that this change

00:35:04.990 --> 00:35:07.360
in ductile-brittle
transition temperature

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.390
never reaches room temperature.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:13.510
You might think, oh, it's OK,
reactors run at 300 Celsius,

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:16.512
and things are pretty
ductile right there.

00:35:16.512 --> 00:35:18.970
Well, you usually have to shut
the reactor down once you're

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:22.120
done with it to refuel, and
if something goes wrong,

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.920
there's a pressure
spike, you can

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:27.140
have a condition called
pressurized thermal shock,

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:28.710
or PTS.

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:32.570
In that case, you would have
a sudden pressure wave from,

00:35:32.570 --> 00:35:35.180
let's say, from steam explosion
or whatever you could have,

00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:37.790
and you want that vessel to
be able to absorb that energy

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.670
instead of breaking in half,
because if you break it half,

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:43.210
that's a radioactive release.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:46.180
The way you test ductile-brittle
transition temperature

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.850
is what's called a
Charpy impact test.

00:35:48.850 --> 00:35:54.220
It's probably the highest tech,
lowest tech test I've seen.

00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:56.650
You simply hit
things with a hammer.

00:35:56.650 --> 00:36:00.520
A very well calibrated,
precise hammer.

00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:04.000
Let me pause so you can see
what the sample looks like.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.710
You have these little
bars with a notch in them.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:09.700
The notch is to make sure that
acts as a stress concentrator,

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.810
and you know where the
breaks going to happen.

00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:16.180
So in a Charpy test, you
line up this little sample,

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.930
and you've got-- actually
in your reactors, usually,

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:21.850
you've got pieces of
the pressure vessel

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:25.330
in this form lining the inside
rim of the reactor pressure

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:26.110
vessel.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:27.880
So every time you
refuel your reactor,

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.340
you take off another
few of these out

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.820
and you hit them with a
very well calibrated hammer.

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:38.760
And you can measure by
actually turning this dial

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.920
and letting the hammer
turn it as it moves

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.780
through the
material, you can see

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.390
how much energy was
absorbed by the material

00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:47.040
as the hammer comes back up.

00:36:49.940 --> 00:36:52.190
So it breaks right through
the material, in this case,

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:55.850
it's in a quenched or brittle
condition, and for some reason,

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.950
they have a lot of footage
of the guy standing

00:36:57.950 --> 00:36:59.750
and not breathing,
but what I want

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:05.040
to show you is what
actually happens here.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.790
I didn't make the
video, I just got it.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:10.330
There we go.

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:12.850
So what you can see is
that if the hammer were

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.880
to move through air
with absolutely no drag,

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.280
it would come back
to the zero position.

00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:20.170
If they had encountered
some resistance,

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.210
like with a piece
of steel in the way,

00:37:22.210 --> 00:37:25.390
it then measures the
amount of energy in joules

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:28.930
that piece of steel absorbs
from the hammer blow.

00:37:28.930 --> 00:37:30.910
The larger that is, the better.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:32.950
And by doing this
test at a number

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.290
of different
temperatures, you can

00:37:35.290 --> 00:37:38.170
recreate this ductile-brittle
transition temperature curve.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:40.540
So they'll take a
few Charpy coupons,

00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:43.510
they will test them at,
let's say, every 25 Celsius,

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:47.050
get a bunch of points, draw
the line through the points,

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.210
and decide where is
the material brittle.

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:53.760
At what temperature
will it become brittle?

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:57.127
To show you what something looks
like when it's not brittle.

00:37:57.127 --> 00:37:58.710
The same test is
done in what's called

00:37:58.710 --> 00:38:01.200
the normalized condition,
where you simply heat

00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.480
the steel to a high
temperature, relaxing out

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.180
most of the defects, and
bringing back as much

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:08.850
of the perfect crystal
structure as possible, which

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:11.820
is really good for letting
dislocations move through it.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:15.540
So the same test is done by
the same awkward feller who

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.540
likes to stand there
and not breathe,

00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.212
but you'll notice a very
different result of this test.

00:38:23.212 --> 00:38:24.920
Doesn't look like it,
but if you actually

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:28.910
look at how much energy was
absorbed, much, much higher.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:31.910
So something like 18
times more energy,

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.430
and you can qualitatively
see the difference

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.230
between these two
conditions by looking

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.450
at the fractured surfaces,
and this is where

00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:40.070
it starts to get intuitive.

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:41.900
Something that's
ductile would tear more

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.140
like taffy, where
something that's brittle

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:47.240
would cleave or break
in half much more

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.767
smoothly, so these are
the two pieces of metal

00:38:49.767 --> 00:38:50.600
that we just showed.

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:55.010
You the one that absorbed 180
joules by lots of defamation,

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.220
and the one that absorbed
10 joules by fracture

00:38:58.220 --> 00:38:59.720
in a brutal way.

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.040
This is what you want your
reactor vessel to behave like,

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.500
but the problem with these
ductile-brittle transition

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.450
temperature curves, is
this not just this part

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:11.270
that you're worried
about, it's that part.

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:15.320
So even at high temperatures,
things get less ductile.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.840
So it's a combination of
temperature and number

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.980
of defects.

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.230
And if either one of
these criteria fails,

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.900
if you become too brittle
at low temperature,

00:39:23.900 --> 00:39:27.950
or your total ductility at high
temperature goes down too much,

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:30.500
that's the end of life
of your reactor vessel,

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.740
and this is one of the biggest
problems in life extensions

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:35.450
of light water reactors.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.640
They were built for 40
years and they originally

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.035
had license for 40 years.

00:39:39.035 --> 00:39:41.660
How many of you guys have heard
of the license extensions going

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.970
on now, to 60 or 80 years?

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.610
Yeah, so a few of you guys.

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.050
I've heard heard, why not
run the reactor longer.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:49.610
Not build a new one,
but keep getting

00:39:49.610 --> 00:39:52.220
all this clean green
cheap nuclear energy?

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:53.660
This is why.

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:57.350
You have to be absolutely
sure that your vessel,

00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.380
your primary containment,
will survive.

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:06.370
And we're not so
sure because well, we

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:11.080
jump to the part of the video
that's got the Charpy coupons.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.610
Those.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:14.970
We ran out.

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:17.190
We only plan to put
these vessels in service

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:21.300
for 40 years, and folks put 40
years worth of these coupons,

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.700
plus some extras, in
the reactor vessel.

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.550
Now, in order to prove
that it's actually

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:28.950
safe to continue
operation, you have

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:32.190
to have some amount
of material to test

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:34.270
and say, OK, this
vessel is still ductile,

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:35.417
it's still going to work.

00:40:35.417 --> 00:40:36.000
What happened?

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.923
What do you do when
you run out of coupons?

00:40:38.923 --> 00:40:40.340
Anyone have any
ideas, because I'm

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:42.480
sure the industry would
love to hear them.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.480
AUDIENCE: Would you have
to start using material

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.810
from the vessel itself?

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.600
MICHAEL SHORT: You could start
using material from the vessel.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.170
That's actually what I plan
to do too, but with some very

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:52.950
strong caveat.

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.580
So if you were to scoop
out a piece of the vessel,

00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:58.920
you then create a
stress concentration.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:02.910
In addition, reactor vessel
looks like a gigantic forging

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:10.720
of really thick carbon
steel with a very thin liner

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:11.770
of stainless steel.

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:18.820
And the stainless steel is
there to prevent corrosion

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:21.490
from the reactor water.

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:25.960
That thin, quarter inch
bit of stainless steel

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.420
is what actually
saved what could

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.503
have been one of the worst
nuclear accidents in US

00:41:29.503 --> 00:41:31.810
history, the Davis
Bessie plant, where there

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:33.280
was a crack in the vessel.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:38.980
Boric acid actually ate
through a whole chunk

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.950
of the pressure vessel, leaving
the stainless steel intact.

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.200
And it's that little quarter
inch stainless steel that

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.418
saved the plant.

00:41:45.418 --> 00:41:46.960
But if you were to
take something out

00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:49.377
from the inside of the vessel,
the part that gets the most

00:41:49.377 --> 00:41:54.800
damage, you'd be taking out some
of the stainless steel, which

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.090
is a problem.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:42:00.640
You could take a piece out
from here, maybe the outside,

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.860
but then you've got a
stress concentrator.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.080
Any sort of chunk
that is missing

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.600
is where a crack is going
to preferentially form,

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.690
so you would weaken that
vessel by taking a piece out.

00:42:10.690 --> 00:42:12.050
Anyone else have any ideas?

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.550
Yeah?

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.860
AUDIENCE: Is it impossible
to just replace the vessel?

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:15.652
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:42:15.652 --> 00:42:17.620
A new vessel means
a new reactor.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.570
So the license for the
plant is intimately

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.940
tied to the license
for the vessel.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:23.530
Any other ideas?

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.440
Yeah?

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.690
AUDIENCE: The creation of the
vessel, just put extra in there

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:29.110
and then take that out.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:31.360
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
what they did, right?

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.850
So that's why these
Charpy coupons were there,

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:36.560
but what do we do about the
vessels that we already have?

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.060
Yeah?

00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.100
AUDIENCE: Can you make
Charpy coupon or coupons

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.630
that are similar to the status
of the ones most recently taken

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:46.540
out of the vessel, and
then just put them in?

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.320
MICHAEL SHORT: That's
what they're doing.

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:51.160
So they're taking these
Charpy coupons, which this

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.230
is bigger than actual size.

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:57.070
They break them, so let's say
this region's all garbage,

00:42:57.070 --> 00:43:00.712
and then they cut a little
mini Charpy coupons out

00:43:00.712 --> 00:43:02.920
of the last piece, and
they're putting those back in.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.180
So that's absolutely right.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:07.210
You've just probably recreated
a year's worth of licensing work

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:08.965
and ideas and in a class.

00:43:08.965 --> 00:43:10.840
But I just want to get
back to Charlie's idea

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.670
because that's what
I think has to happen

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:15.040
is you'd like to be
able to take a piece out

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:18.170
from the actual vessel
and run a test on it.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.710
The only way to do
that is to go nano.

00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:23.410
Take the tiniest,
tiniest little piece out,

00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:26.720
and perform some other
sort of measurement.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.850
So this is the
idea that our group

00:43:28.850 --> 00:43:32.180
has had in using what's called
stored energy of radiation

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:35.580
damage, so I don't mind
telling you about it,

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:38.910
even though it's not like
funded or papered yet

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:42.940
because it's educational,
and it's cool.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.750
So every kind of defect
takes energy to create.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.670
Defects don't just
create themselves.

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:50.920
You either have to raise the
temperature of a material

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.720
or in our case, irradiate it.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.690
And it's the energy of
those incoming neutrons that

00:43:55.690 --> 00:43:58.450
bounces around different
atoms and creates

00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:00.770
all these different
types of defects.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:03.668
So those defects are storing
energy in the material.

00:44:03.668 --> 00:44:05.710
And so if you think about
how much energy does it

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:07.168
take to destroy
something, it would

00:44:07.168 --> 00:44:10.870
have to be the energy that it's
already stored plus the energy

00:44:10.870 --> 00:44:13.000
that you put into
it during the test

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.220
can reach the failure energy.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.410
What if you could measure
the stored energy?

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:18.967
What if there was
a way to know how

00:44:18.967 --> 00:44:20.800
many of each of those
defects there actually

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.570
were in a material?

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.710
We think there is.

00:44:23.710 --> 00:44:24.880
Well, we know there is.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.000
It's called differential
scanning color imagery.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.370
It's a way of
measuring the change

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:33.970
in heat capacity of a
material, where you take two

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:35.782
very small furnaces--

00:44:35.782 --> 00:44:37.990
you don't have to put this
in your notes, by the way,

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:40.040
this is just for fun.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:45.080
You take two small furnaces,
put your chunk of your material

00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:51.000
on one, and you apply a lot
of heat to both of them.

00:44:54.430 --> 00:44:58.030
And you look at the difference
in the amount of heat

00:44:58.030 --> 00:45:01.300
you have to put in to keep the
two at the same temperature.

00:45:01.300 --> 00:45:03.790
So normally, you would
get the heat capacity

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:07.690
of a material, how much heat
can extort per degree Kelvin.

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:11.560
If this material's got a bunch
of defects already in it,

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.440
then you should release that
defect energy by heating it

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.160
and that would take a little
less energy to heat it up,

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.770
but there's a lot of
problems with calorimetry,

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:23.740
so we're actually using
what's called nanocalorimetry.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.460
We're doing this process
on nanograms of material

00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:29.740
and seeing if you can
irradiate something and measure

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.660
its stored energy
because if you could,

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.910
you could take a tiny
little razor blade,

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:36.820
take out the smallest
sliver of the vessel--

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.200
smaller than a grain of sand.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.150
Not enough to cause a crack--

00:45:40.150 --> 00:45:42.165
enough to measure
its stored energy.

00:45:42.165 --> 00:45:44.540
And I want to show you guys
what this process looks like.

00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.080
So I'm just going to deviate
from the actual lecture,

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.880
and jump into the topic
I'll give tomorrow.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.910
I think it's more interesting
and more relevant.

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:01.310
There we go.

00:46:04.705 --> 00:46:06.580
I'm going to skip through
some of this stuff,

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.560
but it's within the
last five minutes,

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.810
I'll try to get through this,
see if this is a record.

00:46:10.810 --> 00:46:12.780
It's what we call the
ultimate snipe hunt.

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.260
Has anyone here been
on a snipe hunt?

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:16.208
What's a snipe hunt?

00:46:16.208 --> 00:46:18.500
AUDIENCE: People bringing
you in the woods and tell you

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:20.750
you're looking for a
bird that doesn't exist.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.280
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.690
Pretty much this, right?

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.640
They say bang a bunch
of sticks, get a bag,

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:26.630
and go look for snipes.

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:28.310
They don't exist, right?

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:30.540
They actually do.

00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:31.785
Snipes are real.

00:46:31.785 --> 00:46:33.865
You pretty much have to
be British to know it,

00:46:33.865 --> 00:46:35.490
because they hunt
them there for sport,

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:37.290
and apparently,
they're delicious.

00:46:37.290 --> 00:46:39.920
That's actually where
we get the term snipe

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.950
because the actual size of the
sniper compared to the sniper

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:44.030
is about that.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:45.830
If you can shoot
that bird with a gun,

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:49.700
you are an expert marksman and
deserve the delicious and tiny

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:52.480
treat that you've then blown
apart with your bullet--

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:54.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:55.970
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah, exactly.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:59.120
So you can you know rain
bird dust on whatever meal

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.770
you've already prepared.

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:03.290
That's what I like in finding
these radiation damage

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:04.753
defects too.

00:47:04.753 --> 00:47:06.170
Because some
experiments have been

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:10.580
done to plot the number of
defects versus their size.

00:47:10.580 --> 00:47:13.670
And as the defects get bigger,
the number of them decrease.

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:17.960
So most defects are very, very
small, and it turns out that--

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:21.168
first of all, the resolution
of the screen is funny.

00:47:21.168 --> 00:47:22.460
I think I know how to fix that.

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.490
Clone the screen and then
jump back to presenter mode.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:31.350
That usually-- that's
not what I wanted.

00:47:31.350 --> 00:47:33.810
That's what I wanted, great.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:36.690
Most of the defects that cause
these reductions in material

00:47:36.690 --> 00:47:39.930
properties are too small to
see, even in the transmission

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:42.070
electron microscope.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:45.490
So I don't have to tell you this
stuff again, that I don't like

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:47.590
the DPA, I showed you that.

00:47:47.590 --> 00:47:49.540
What we want is that.

00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.070
We took some
inspiration directly

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.660
from the Manhattan Project.

00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:55.570
Luckily, I have an uncle who
works at the DuPont Library

00:47:55.570 --> 00:47:59.740
and Dupont was quite responsible
for the Manhattan Project.

00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.200
So this memo between Eugene
Wigner and Leo Szilard--

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.210
one of whom won the Nobel
Prize, the other one

00:48:04.210 --> 00:48:05.710
probably should have--

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:08.320
said, hey, radiation
stores energy

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:12.160
by neutron collisions like
cold working and amorphization.

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.160
So we've dug up this original
memo from the 40s, and said,

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.370
let's do this for everything
because every defect has

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.500
its unique amount of
energy that it stores

00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.570
and creating it in
some different amount

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:27.120
of eV per defect, and we've
done some molecular dynamics

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.670
simulations to show that
this amount of energy stored

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.200
is pretty universal.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.140
When you irradiate something, we
predict that it stores about 2%

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:36.832
of its energy in
radiation defense.

00:48:36.832 --> 00:48:38.790
So if you know the number
of neutrons that hit,

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:41.340
and you know that the amount
of energy per neutron,

00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:43.480
you know how much
you're looking for.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:46.900
You know what your
signal should be.

00:48:46.900 --> 00:48:50.650
And to jump through to the whole
idea of differential scanning

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.450
calorimetry, it's
like what I drew here,

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:54.190
but a lot more legible.

00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:56.920
You simply heat two
materials, one of which

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.800
contains your sample,
measure their temperature,

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.830
and look how much energy it
takes between them to keep them

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.870
at the same temperature.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.505
We did some of
these measurements

00:49:06.505 --> 00:49:08.380
on a piece of steel from
the nuclear reactor,

00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.005
and we got a whole
bunch of interesting

00:49:10.005 --> 00:49:12.502
looking peaks for the
red curve compared

00:49:12.502 --> 00:49:14.710
to the blue curve in the
other irradiated conditions,

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:16.990
so we think there's
something there.

00:49:16.990 --> 00:49:19.750
So we tried a more controlled
experiment irradiating

00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:22.300
aluminum with helium
ions and the accelerator

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.420
in Northwest 13.

00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.250
And we were encouraged
because the initial time

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.070
that we heated this material,
we got some stored energy

00:49:30.070 --> 00:49:32.260
out of it in some funky
spectrum that might tell us

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.910
what the defects are.

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:36.990
The bad news is we got that
with the control heat too,

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:39.472
and the really bad news
is that when you normalize

00:49:39.472 --> 00:49:40.930
all these curves,
you get something

00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:44.520
that you can't tell if I
drew it or my son drew it.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:46.200
Looks suspiciously
like the doodles

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.480
that he does, not
scientific data.

00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.190
And the problem is that
DSC, differential scanning

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:55.190
calorimetry, induces a lot
of artifacts in the signal

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:58.150
that we couldn't
separate from the noise.

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:00.580
So our solution was to go nano.

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.580
To use a nano a DSC, or
nano differential scanning

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:06.730
calorimeter, that can
heat about 10,000 times

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:09.430
faster than a traditional DSC.

00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:12.400
So you can get your energy
out from smaller materials

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.970
way faster than these artifacts
can manifest themselves.

00:50:15.970 --> 00:50:17.883
What we think is
going to happen is

00:50:17.883 --> 00:50:19.300
that every one of
these peaks here

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:23.290
is going to correspond to one
type of defect that's released

00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:25.090
at a certain temperature.

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:28.990
And by extrapolating, or
say, integrating the area

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:32.410
under those curves, you get the
energy in each type of defect.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:35.530
And by extrapolating
to a zero heating rate,

00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:37.960
you should know which
type of defect they are.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.820
And if you know which
defects you have

00:50:39.820 --> 00:50:42.850
and how many of each one,
you know the full defect

00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:44.500
properties and
material, you should

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.302
know it's material properties.

00:50:46.302 --> 00:50:48.760
Because we already know if you
have this many dislocations,

00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:53.060
it's this brittle, the question
is how many dislocations.

00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:55.185
So we start off by--

00:50:55.185 --> 00:50:56.810
we use a different
kind of calorimeter.

00:50:56.810 --> 00:50:58.760
It actually fits on a chip.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.500
In fact, there's two on a chip.

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.960
There's one that we
put our material on,

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:05.750
and one as a reference
that we both put

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:08.450
in the accelerator being
irradiated at the same time

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:10.672
to control for that
effect, and this is

00:51:10.672 --> 00:51:11.880
what they actually look like.

00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.370
The scale bar here
is 100 microns,

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:16.880
and that transparent spot
is a little bit of aluminum

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:21.140
that we vapor deposited
onto the calorimeter.

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.880
Right there.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.080
And so the way this process
works, is we take our DSC chip,

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:30.470
we put a mask over it,
vaporize some aluminum

00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:33.020
to deposit on one
of the calorimeters,

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.090
take the mask away, and
irradiate the whole thing,

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:39.930
and then finally put it
in the nanocalorimeter,

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.680
and I'll show you what
happens slowed down

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.240
by a factor of 1,000.

00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.500
That pulse right there.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:48.832
That whole thing just went from
zero to 450c a millisecond.

00:51:48.832 --> 00:51:50.790
And the reason it took
a second is because I've

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:54.180
slowed down the video by
4,000 or by 5,000 times,

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:56.790
and that little pulse
of heat actually

00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:59.550
released some of
the defect energy.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:02.460
We were able to see very
clearly, the first time we

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.740
heated the sample,
this extra area

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:08.400
corresponds to some
sort of energy release.

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.605
We then heated that same
sample a whole bunch of times,

00:52:11.605 --> 00:52:13.980
and made sure that it was
always the same, which meant we

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:16.940
had a fully relaxed material.

00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:18.493
And it shows some
sort of a trend.

00:52:18.493 --> 00:52:20.660
If you note this data was
taken like two months ago,

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:21.830
it's pretty fresh.

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:24.050
Not published yet, so
hopefully by the time

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:26.250
this video comes
out, it will be.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:28.250
And we see some sort of
trend between the amount

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:30.542
of irradiation it gives and
the amount of stored energy

00:52:30.542 --> 00:52:31.560
you can get out of it.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:34.620
So this is what we hope can be
used instead of those Charpy

00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:35.730
coupons.

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:37.710
We can go much, much
smaller and just take out

00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:40.890
tiny pieces of the vessel
and get the same information

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:44.790
as you would from a Charpy
test but on the nanoscale.

00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:47.680
So the question then is, where
is the defect fingerprints?

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.360
Where are those
individual defects

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.260
that we were looking for?

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:55.520
Well, I think they're just
popping up right here.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.080
The reason for that is we
picked a very fast heating rate

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:01.870
for our experiments, and doing
these sorts of measurements

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:05.738
on other materials shows that
at 10,000 Kelvin per second--

00:53:05.738 --> 00:53:07.030
think about that for a second--

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:09.570
10,000 Kelvin per second.

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:11.730
So in a millisecond,
something heats up

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:17.210
by 10 K, which is ridiculous.

00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:18.440
Yeah, something like that.

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:21.310
You don't really see any peaks.

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:24.410
The heating is so fast
that the defects don't even

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:27.350
have time to find each other,
annihilate, and release

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:28.670
their stored energy.

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:30.800
So we need to repeat the
experiments at some lower

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:33.630
temperatures, see
what the peaks are,

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:36.920
but if you go too low, you
end up getting a lot of noise

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:37.803
in your signal.

00:53:37.803 --> 00:53:40.220
So there's going to be some
sweet spot that we haven't yet

00:53:40.220 --> 00:53:43.520
found in order to see
this stored energy.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:46.880
So we're just at the very
first experimental stage

00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:49.820
of trying to see can we
extend reactor lifetimes.

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:51.375
After doing
simulations for a year

00:53:51.375 --> 00:53:53.000
that probably no one
believes until you

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:56.270
do an experiment, including me.

00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:58.950
But for now, it actually
shows some sort of a trend,

00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:01.370
so it's just enough
justification for us

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:02.870
to buy one of these
nanocalorimeters

00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:05.158
and start looking for real.

00:54:05.158 --> 00:54:07.700
So if you want to see, now I've
taken you from basic material

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:09.890
science, to where's
the field going to,

00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:13.457
how do we keep our reactors
running in about two hours.

00:54:13.457 --> 00:54:15.290
I think that's the most
compact introduction

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:19.110
to nuclear materials I
can possibly give you.

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:21.170
So any questions on
what you've seen today?

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:23.580
AUDIENCE: Is that roughly
the trend you would expect?

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:25.530
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes,
I would expect an up.

00:54:25.530 --> 00:54:27.060
That's the best I can say.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:28.990
As far as is it actually a line?

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:30.330
Is it a curve?

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:34.537
I am not as brave or stupid as
some of the other folks that

00:54:34.537 --> 00:54:36.870
will draw an arbitrary shaped
line through a single data

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:37.950
point.

00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:41.127
So I'm not drawing
a trend line yet.

00:54:41.127 --> 00:54:42.210
Yeah, any other questions?

00:54:42.210 --> 00:54:43.190
Yeah?

00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:45.630
AUDIENCE: Is it-- or I guess
you're making the assumption

00:54:45.630 --> 00:54:48.620
that one little spot in the
reactive pressure vessel

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:53.140
to say what the rest of the
vessel has been exposed to?

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:54.390
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, not at all.

00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:55.980
Take a whole bunch.

00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.980
Then, instead of just
doing Charpy coupons

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:02.610
of one place, which is what
we do now, you can get a map.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:04.230
We don't have that
information now,

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:06.230
but if you take pieces
from all over the vessel,

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:09.840
then you get an actual 3D
map instead of a single point

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.340
of saying all right,
well, we picked

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:13.750
what we think is going to
be the worst condition.

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:14.910
How do you know?

00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:16.550
You don't.

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:17.890
How do you know for sure?

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:19.265
You make measurements
like these.

00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:24.420
Any other questions?

00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:24.920
Yeah?

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:27.260
AUDIENCE: What would
a peak in this graph

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:31.100
correspond to in terms of like--

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.640
How does it relate to some
sort of damage effect?

00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.640
MICHAEL SHORT: We would
expect that a peak would

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:40.090
relate to a certain type of
defect reaction occurring.

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:43.060
When some type of defect gets
high enough in temperature

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:47.170
that it goes from stuck to
mobile, and as that moves,

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:49.750
it encounters anything else
it will in the material,

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:52.540
and will react with all
the other defects nearby,

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.640
decimating the
population of that defect

00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.890
and slightly depressing
that of the others.

00:55:56.890 --> 00:55:58.890
And as you go higher, and
higher in temperature,

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:00.910
the slower and slower
defects start to move.

00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.100
Yeah?

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.892
AUDIENCE: So you can
get rid of the defects

00:56:05.892 --> 00:56:07.545
by heating it quickly?

00:56:07.545 --> 00:56:08.420
MICHAEL SHORT: Mm-hmm

00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:12.380
AUDIENCE: Would there be a way
to self repair our radiation

00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:14.298
damage to pressure
vessels themselves?

00:56:14.298 --> 00:56:15.840
MICHAEL SHORT: That
would be awesome.

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:19.310
But the properties of the
vessel are highly dependent on,

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:22.490
not just its composition,
but the heat treatment

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:23.840
that went to make it.

00:56:23.840 --> 00:56:25.310
If you heat that
vessel, you both

00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:28.820
remove the radiation damage and
remove the strengthening put

00:56:28.820 --> 00:56:32.020
in by the forging
and heating process.

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.300
So you would have,
if-- again, if you

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:39.010
let's say, replace the vessel
you have a new reactor.

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:41.590
If you heat the
vessel too much, it's

00:56:41.590 --> 00:56:45.590
no longer a code stamp vessel.

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:48.110
Pretty tricky spot
that we're in, huh?

00:56:48.110 --> 00:56:51.103
But we're trying to
science our way out of it.

00:56:51.103 --> 00:56:52.520
Well, it's a couple
minutes after.

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:58.300
I don't want to keep you longer,
but I'll open on Thursday

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.270
with a little story about
how mass attenuation

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:04.880
coefficients can get you out
of apartheid South Africa.

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:06.080
I'm serious.

00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:10.000
And then we'll move into
dose and biological effects.

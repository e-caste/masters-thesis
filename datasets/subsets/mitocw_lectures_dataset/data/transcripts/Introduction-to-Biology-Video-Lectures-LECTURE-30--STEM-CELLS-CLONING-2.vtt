WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good morning, class.
Nice to see you here,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you loyal holdouts, the stalwarts
who haven't gone home early for

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thanksgiving. You recall that
last time we were talking about the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Matevoidic system, and
much of the rationale for

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
studying it stems from two reasons.
First of all, it recapitulates in a

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
formal sense what happens
during embryogenesis,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
i.e. one has relatively
undifferentiated stem cells which

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are able to differentiate into a
number of different directions by

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
committing themselves to either
the myeloid or lymphoid compartment,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and then going down yet other
pathways, more detailed pathways to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
generate a whole
variety of cell types.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Secondly, we really understand
the differentiation pathways of

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Matevoisis better than we
understand any tissue in the body,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in no small part because it's much
easier to study the soluble cells in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the blood and in the immune system
than it is to study how these

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
processes happen in normal
tissues. But having said that,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I want to emphasize the fact that
in each of our tissues there are

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
oligopotential stem cells.
When I say oligopotential I mean

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
they can go down several different
pathways. Recall up there on that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
diagram we talked about
pluripotential which means multiple,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and today we're going to talk a
bit about todipotential stem cells,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which are able to disperse
descendants into all the different

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
differentiation
lineages in the body.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
At the end of our last lecture,
we were focusing on the red blood

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
cells. And this is sometimes
called erythropoiesis,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
which is to say the process by
which red blood cells are generated.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We mentioned the concept of
homeostasis, and homeostasis just

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
refers to the fact that all of these
systems are in very delicate balance

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
so that the body can respond to the
physiologic needs of the organism at

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
any one point in time. We
talked about the fact that for

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
example when there's a
massive infection in the body,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
then the homeostatic mechanisms
allow an increase in these kinds of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
immune cells in order to
encounter the infection.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And at the end of our last lecture,
we were talking about this specific

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
branch, and how in fact
homeostasis is maintained there.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And what we see here is a
series of committed progenitors.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So when I talk about committed
progenitors I'm referring to cells

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
that have already made the
commitment to go down one

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
or another pathway. They're
not yet fully differentiated.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
As you can see here, we
have first forming cells and

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
colony forming cells. We
don't need to remember all the

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
different abbreviations except to
say that these cells here are in a

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
relative undifferentiated
state. And the only end stage

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
differentiation comes at the very
end here when we get to red blood

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
cells. We said in general that
it's the case that most highly

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
differentiated cells are
post-mitotic, which is to say

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
they're never going to reenter into
the growth and division cycle of the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
cell that we talked about
earlier in the semester.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And that's obviously dictated here
by the fact that this erythrocyte

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
lacks a nucleus, i.e.
during the final stage of

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
differentiation, in addition
to accumulating large

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
amounts of hemoglobin in its
cytoplasm, this cell actually pops

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
out its nucleus, and that
obviously represents an

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
irrevocable change in that cell
can never again enter into growth

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and division cycle. The
immediate precursor of an

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
erythrocyte is often called an
erythroblast. And the term blast

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
here refers to a cell of embryonic
appearance. Blast is used often to

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
indicate, we'll mention that again
shortly, a cell which looks very

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
primitive, and embryonic, and
undifferentiated. And that ends

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
up going into an erythrocyte,
which we said is actually a synonym

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
for a red blood cell,
an RBC, a red blood cell.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And we talked about the fact
that this progression is actually

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
maintained and furthered by the
stimulus of the compound called

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
erythropoietin. So, we're
using some of the same

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
words over and over again. And
erythropoietin is essentially a

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
growth factor which stimulates the
end stage differentiation of the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
erythroblast into
the erythrocyte.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Epo, as erythropoietin's often
abbreviated, is actually made in the

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000
kidneys. And it's made in
the kidneys in response to the

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
physiological stimulus of
hypoxia. Hypoxia means inadequate

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
oxygenation of the tissues.
You might ask, well, why is red

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.000
blood cell contractions controlled,
as they are, in the kidney?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And the fact is, we don't
really know why evolution

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
has chosen the kidney as the site of
monitoring the degree of oxygenation

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
of the blood. And in response to
hypoxia, it begins to crank out

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
erythropoietin, or
Epo. You can think of

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
erythropoietin as an extracellular
liggon just like a growth factor.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It has its own cognate receptor
on the surface of the erythroblast,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and when Epo released by the kidney
hits an erythroblast in the context

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
of the bone marrow, it
actually has two effects.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It happens to be the case that
roughly even 95% of the erythroblast

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
that are made routinely are forced
to go into apitosis under routine

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
conditions. So, this is
an enormously wasteful

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
system, i.e. as every moment we
speak, 90 or 95% of the erythroblast

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that have come into existence
in your bone marrow apitose.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
They never go into end
stage differentiation.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But when Epo is around, Epo
provides a strong anti-apoptotic

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:56.000
signal to the red blood saves
some and maybe even all of the

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
erythroblasts from their normal
fate of undergoing apitosis.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So here, if we imagine
there are actually two fates,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
one is to become an erythrocyte,
and the other is to apitose, where

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
the aptisosis is paradoxically
enough the dominant fate of the cell,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
the moment that an Epo comes on the
scene, it blocks this alternative

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
fate, allowing these cells to mature.
Epo at the same time stimulates the

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
erythroblast to differentiate.
Now, you might as yourself the

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
question, why is there this
enormously inefficient process?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
An enormous effort is made to crank
out large, astronomical numbers of

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
erythroblasts, and yet
most of them are wasted even

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
before they've had a chance to
undergo end stage differentiation.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And the rationale here is as
follows. This is a terrific system

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
for rapidly ramping up the level of
red blood cells in your circulation

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
because here, within a matter of
a day or two, one can crank up,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
actually in a matter of hours,
you can crank up the rate of

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
production of red blood cells
by maybe even a factor of ten.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Instead of having 90% of
the erythroblast apitose,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
let's say 0% of them do so, and
therefore, instead of having 10%

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
of the erythroblasts becoming red
blood cells, 100% of them will do so.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And therefore, you have
the virtually miraculous

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
response that if you go from here
high up in the rocky mountains at

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
ten or 12,000 feet, within a
matter of two or three days,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
your red blood cell concentration
actually has compensated,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
has risen up to create the oxygen
caring capacity that enables you to

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
deal with the thin oxygen, with
the low oxygen tension that's

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
present at high altitudes.
Now, having said that,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:52.000
the fact is that there is an Epo
receptor on the surface of the

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
erythroblast, and what we
see there is the following.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Let's talk about the erythroblast
and just blow it up a little bit.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So, here's the erythroblast.
That's the undifferentiated

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
precursor. And by the way, the
erythroblast is actually still a

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
white blood cell. Often we
call a white blood cell a

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
leukocyte. You may know
that gluco means white. So,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
a leukocyte, it's still white.
And after the erythropotent

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
impinges on it, one of the
things it starts doing is

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
to make the hemoglobin, which
turns it into a red blood cell.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
At this stage, it's still white.
On the surface of the erythroblast

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
are these Epo receptors. I'll
just abbreviate them like this,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Epo receptor, and once it binds
the liggon Epo just like the growth

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
factor receptors, we talked
early in the receptors

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
signals are sent into the
erythroblast to stimulate both

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
differentiation and to prevent
the initiation of the cell suicide

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
program that we call apitosis.
Interestingly, one of the things

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that happens normally is the
following, that when these signals

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
come in, there is an enzyme called
a phosphotase which is attracted

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
to the receptor. The
Epo receptor works like a

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
tyrosine kinase growth factor
receptor that we talked about

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
earlier in the semester.
And here, we have an enzyme,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
a phosphotase, which actually
counteracts the function of the

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
tyrosine kinases. So,
after the Epo receptor has

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
bound its liggon, here's
the plasma membrane,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
it has a whole series of
I'll draw Y here for tyrosine.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
It has a whole series of phosphates
attached to it because of the

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
actions of tyrosine kinase enzymes
that are associated with its

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
cytoplasmic domain indirect analogy
to what we talked about in the case

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
of growth factor receptors. But,
one of the things that happens

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
is that this phosphotase, which
removes phosphates, then gloms

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
onto the receptor like this.
It grabs hold of some of these

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
tyrosine kinases. And what
this phosphotase does is

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
reach around. It reaches around and
it begins to prune off all of these

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
phosphates because that's
what a phosphate does.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It cuts away all the phosphates,
thereby directly reversing the

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
previous actions of the tyrosine
kinase that led to the formation of

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
these phosphates, and that
in turn allows downstream

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
signaling to occur. This
is obviously a functional

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
negative feedback loop, i.e.
whenever there is an agonist

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
you want an antagonist.
Whenever there's a stimulus which

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
is induced in the body, there
has to be an inhibitory signal,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and this is part of the
whole issue of homeostasis,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
the balance between forward and
backward. Interestingly enough,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
there's a family in Finland, I
believe, which has a mutant receptor.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And their mutant receptor
lacks this tyrosine.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And what happens as a consequence
is that that particular tyrosine

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
doesn't get phosphorolated.
Because that tyrosine doesn't get

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
phosphorolated, the
phosphotase cannot be attracted

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
to the receptor because
there isn't a tyrosine there.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
There's some other amino acid
residue. I don't know what it is.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
It's not important, but it's not
a tyrosine. And this cannot happen

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
because they don't have this
tyrosine. This phosphotase could

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
not be attracted to the receptor
to shut it down as it normally

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
would be. So normally
homeostasis is

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
imbalanced, and several members
of this family have become Olympic

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
cross-country ski winners.
They've become Olympic champions.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Why? Because their Epo receptor's
hyperactive. Because the Epo

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
receptor's hyperactive, they
have higher than normal levels

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
of red blood cells in the
circulation, and this clearly allows

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
them to function better
in cross country skiing,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
which as you know is a really
physically demanding task.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Again, I'm not saying this is a
good thing for them necessarily.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
There are other things in life
besides, believe it or not,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
winning cross country Olympic
competitions because as I mentioned

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
last time, having too many red
blood cells in your circulation,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
there's a downside to it which
is that you have a much greater

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
tendency to have occlusions,
to have blood clots in your

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
circulation which obviously is
not a very good thing to have.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Oh, so is there
a threshold of Epo

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
receptor activation before
phosphotase shuts it down?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
These things are not really well
understood, are not well studied.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
The fact is, you might be able to
say we should make a mathematical

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
model of all of these different
circuitry. But the fact is if you

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
want to make a mathematical
model, you have to know some of the

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
constants. You have to know some
of the parameters, the binding

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
constants. And in
fact, for most of the

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
signaling interactions, no
one's ever really studied them in

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
such great detail. So,
one really doesn't know how

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
much phosphate you need here before
the phosphotase becomes really

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
active. And so, there's
not a really good

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
mathematical model of this feedback
loop, even though we know without

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
any doubt that it exists. So,
I want to get into other issues

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
that are related to the whole
issue of accumulated differentiation

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
traits as one moves
down this pathway.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Again, we've used this as a model
for how differentiation takes place

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
in the entire body. The
faith that's been implicit in

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
this kind of scheme for the last 20
or 30 years is that this acquisition

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
of different kinds of phenotypes is
not accompanied by genetic changes,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
that is, in the genomes of these
cells. I.e. one can accomplish

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
these different kinds of
differentiation not by rearranging

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
genes but just by rearranging
transcriptional programs,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and that the DNA sequence of
these cells as they proliferate and

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
differentiate is fully unchanged.
And that's a matter of faith

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
because you could say to me,
how do you know that it's really

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
true. The fact is that people have
looked at genes in many kinds of

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
cell types, but it's essentially
impossible, or it has been at least

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
until recently, to preclude
the possibility that as

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
cells move down these
differentiation pathways,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
they begin to change the
nucleotide sequences of different

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
ones of their genes. In fact,
I've already told you about

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
one instance where that's clearly
the case. And that is in the

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
differentiation of the B
cells of the immune system,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
which happen to be right up here
on this chart, because as you recall

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
from our discussion vis-à-vis
immunology, the B cells actually do

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
rearrange their genes in order to
cobble together DNA sequences that

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
together are able to enable them
to make antibodies that are able to

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
react to specific antigens. So
there, there's no doubt at all

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
that there's a somatic rearrangement
of the genes, somatic meaning it's

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
not a germ line change. It's
happening in the soma outside

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
of the germ line. There's
a somatic mutation.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
It's not a mutation that's
deleterious, but rather is directed

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
towards a physiologically
normal and desirable end point.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But for example, how do you know
that when you remember things in the

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
brain, part of the memory does
not derive from changing the DNA

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
sequence and different
neurons in the brain?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
What's the molecular basis of memory?
Could it be that each time we learn

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
some things that there are
different nucleotide sequences,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000
critical nucleotide sequences,
that are changed in neurons in the

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
brain, and that those nucleotide
sequence changes represent an

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
important basis for ensuring that
memory is retained over decades of

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
time. Or, rather than having
genetic changes in the brain,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
might it all be epigenetic, i. .
all the other changes that happen

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.000
to the cell besides changing DNA
sequences in the chromosomal DNA.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So, here we're dealing with the
dialectic between epigenetic and

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
genetic. And, have we
talked about DNA methylation

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
here? Yes, so we talked about DNA
methylation, and do you recall or

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
having discussed the fact
that when DNA gets methylated,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
that suppresses the
transcription of a gene.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
But that doesn't change
the nucleotide sequence,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and that methylation configuration
of a gene can be passed to one cell

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
generation to the next.
It's heritable, but it's not

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
genetic in the strictest
sense of the term, i.e.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
it doesn't involve a change
in nucleotide sequence,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
which is what we want to
limit this term to referring.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
So, epigenic can represent all the
changes in the cell including DNA

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
methylation, alterations
in transcription,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and all other downstream events
that result in changes in the cell.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And how can one address this?
Well, there are different ways of

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
addressing this question or
addressing the possibility that in

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
fact there are changes in the
nucleotide sequence of the gene.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.000
One way to do this is the following.
And that is to take cells from an

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.000
early embryo, and here we see
an early vertebrate embryo.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:42.000
This looks really more like a frog
embryo or a slightly different shape,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000
and here we see an early embryo.
It's after a blastula. It's called

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000
a blastocyst. Here again
we have the word blast.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000
How about one question per lecture?
We have to have some equity here.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Other people can ask questions.
It's good to ask questions,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
but how about one per lecture;
that's fair, equitable.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
All right, so here's an
early vertebrate embryo.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Here we see the blastocyst. This
comes after the earlier stages

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
in the embryo, and here
we see the inner cell mass.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000
And as it turns out, the inner cell
mass is going to be the precursor of

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
many of the tissues of the
ultimately arising embryo.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000
And here, one can do an interesting
experiment. One can take cells out

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000
of the inner cell mass. And
one can begin to propagate them

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
in culture. And what one ends
up with is embryonic stem cells.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And the intrinsic interest of
embryonic stem cells is manifold.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
For one thing, you can take
embryonic stem cells and you can

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
genetically alter them.
You can put a new gene in,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
in the case of a mouse, or
you can take another gene out.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.000
And then what you can do is you
can inject the genetically altered

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
embryonic stem cell into the
blastocyst of another embryo.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
So let's say we take the cells
out of the inner cell mass.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
We develop embryonic stem cells.
We can call them ES cells. That's

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
what they're called in the trade,
ES cells. We take them out. We can

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
propagate them in culture. And
then, what we can find is we'll

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
put a genetic marker in those ES
cells. Let's say we put in those

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
embryonic stem cells the marker
for the gene beta-galactosidase.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And beta-galactosidase in the
presence of a proper indicator,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
if you put a proper indicator
and make a cell turn blue.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
So now we have an ES cell line
that produces the beta-galactosidase

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
enzyme. The beta-galactosidase
enzyme beta-gal itself has no effect

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
on the biology of the cells.
It's only a marker. And now,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
we take those ES cells, and we
inject them into another embryo,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
a wild type embryo that
lacks this beta-gal marker.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And what we can see is that we
inject the ES cells into this

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
blastocyst. The injected ES cells
will now insinuate themselves,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:15.000
will now intrude into the massive
cells in this embryo into which we

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000
injected the ES cells, and
they will become part of the

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.000
entire embryo genesis that follows.
I.e. soon these foreign ES cells

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
will weasel their way
into this inner cell mass.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
And they will become established
and become functionally equivalent to

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
the inner cell mass cells that
were resident there prior to this

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
injection. And what you can do then
is follow the subsequent fate of,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
in this case, a mouse. And what
will happen often is that you can

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
find blue cells all over the
mouse sometimes in the paws,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
sometimes in the coat. Let's
imagine that the hair would turn

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
blue, which in fact is not the case.
But let's imagine the hair would

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.000
turn blue. So
here's the mouse,

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
happy because it's part
of an important experiment.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And what you'll sometimes see is
that, well, remember that art was

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
not my forte. Anyhow, here
you might see stripes of blue

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
cells on the skin. The hair
won't turn blue actually,

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
but the skin may if you
give it the proper indicator.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And what this indicates is that
in this case, the cells that were

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
injected into the blastocyst
could become part of lineages which

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:39.000
committed themselves
to becoming skin cells.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Or, the cells in the brain might
be blue. Or, the cells in the gut

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
might be blue. Or under
certain conditions,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
the cells in the intestine might
be blue. In telling you that,

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I mean to indicate that the
cells that we injected into this

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
blastocyst, which carry
beta-gal were totipotent.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
They could create all the tissues
of the mouse under the proper

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
conditions. The proper conditions
are obviously being put into this

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
very special environment in
which all kinds of differentiation

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
inducing signals, which
we don't really understand,

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
can induce this cell to commit
itself to enter into one or another

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
differentiation lineage. And
in principal, you can make a

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
whole organism out of an ES cell.
ES cell has as much plasticity, as

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
much flexibility,
as a fertilized egg.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
It has not yet lost the ability
to make all the parts of the body.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
On some occasions, the ES cell
will even get into the gonads of the

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
mouse, which are down here
somewhere. And if that's so,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
if the ES cell which you injected
has been able to seed the formation

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
of these cells down here, then
what will happen is that either

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
the sperm or the egg coming
from this mouse will now transmit

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
the blue gene. And now,
in the next generation,

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
all of the mice will inherit the
blue beta-galactosidase gene in all

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.000
of their cells because now this
will have entered into the germ line.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:22.000
If these blue cells happen
to colonize the testes,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000
the ovary, or the testes, then
these blue cells will become

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
ancestors to the sperm or the egg.
And now, in the next generation,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000
mice will inherit a blue
gene in all of their cells.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And now this mouse is really
happy because it's now part of an

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
extremely important experiment
because now all of its cells will

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
become blue, having inherited them
as part of the oocyte which led to

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
its formation. In
this kind of an animal,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
we call this animal a kind of
a chimera. Chimera is a mythical

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
beast which is, let's say,
half human and half horse

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
or something like that.
Or a chimera means it has

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
genetically different parts in it.
That is not to say that these parts

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
carrying the blue gene
are necessarily defective,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.000
they're just genetically different,
one from the other. But they can

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
participate in embryogenesis in
a fashion that's indistinguishable

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
from the non-blue cells. They
just do everything they're

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
supposed to do, and they
pretend as if they were in

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000
this embryo from the get go,
from the very beginning, from the

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
moment of fertilization.
So they are totipotent.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
There's an alternative experiment
you can do, and you can take the ES

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
cells, and you can inject
them under the skin of a mouse,

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
let's say. So now, you're
putting them in a very unfamiliar

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
environment. And what you see
then on many occasions is you can

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
actually get a tumor. You
can get what's called an

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:00.000
embryonal carcinoma.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Now you'll say, well,
so what? That's not so

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000
interesting. But it's
very interesting. Why?

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Because if you look at the genome
of those embryonal carcinoma cells

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
which we can call EC cells if you
want, those cells are genetically

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
full wild type. And yet,
we're getting a tumor here.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
So, it means that these cells,
which have been placed in a fully

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
unfamiliar environment under the
skin or in the belly of a mouse will

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
begin to form a tumor. And
in fact, they represent the

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
only type of cell that we know
about where a cell having a wild type

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
genome can actually
give you a tumor.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
As you sensed from our previous
discussions, all other kinds of

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000
human cancer cells we know about
have to have mutant genes in order

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
for them to grow as a malignancy.
These cells are fully wild type and

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
can grow as an embryonal carcinoma.
They are very primitive. These

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.000
cells have quite a bit of autonomy.
They're not so responsive to all

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
the growth factors that normally
are required by many cells throughout

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
the soma of an animal
throughout the tissues.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
So this allows us to begin to move
on and ask other kinds of questions.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000
For example, you can take
these embryonal carcinoma cells.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.000
You put them in a Petri dish, and
you can actually induce them to

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
differentiate into different
cell types in vitro.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.000
How can you do that? Well,
we're just beginning to learn

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
how to do that. We don't
really know how to do that.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
But, if you give them the right
cocktail of growth factors,

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
they might begin to form muscle
cells. If you give them another

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
cocktail of growth factors, they
might begin to give pancreatic

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
eyelid cells that form insulin,
or in this case cartilage cells.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
And presumably, the cocktail of
growth factors you're providing each

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
one of these cells with in vitro,
i.e. in the Petri dish, is mimicking

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
the growth factor environment
that each of these cell types is

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
experiencing within the
embryo. In other words,

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
cells in different parts of
the embryo experience different

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
combinations of growth factors that
persuade them to commit themselves

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
to becoming these kind of cells,
these kind of cells, and these kind

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
of cells. And therefore, one
of the promises of embryonic

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
stem cell research is the
possibility of being able to

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
regenerate different kinds of
tissues in a fashion that I just

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
showed you here. But this
whole experiment in the

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000
case of human beings is
ethically extremely controversial.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Why? Because the experiment starts
out making these ES cells here,

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000
and if we want to start out
with an early embryo like this,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
start out with a blastocyst, in
the case of a human blastocyst,

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
this human blastocyst has
the potential under the proper

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000
conditions of becoming a newborn
human being. And therefore,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
we have this enormous ethical
conflict in this country.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Is this blastocyst already a human
being? Can you already afford to

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
truncate the life of this blastocyst
at this stage of development,

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000
and in so doing, are you
actually extinguishing human life,

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
or is this organism, if you want to
call it that, already still much too

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000
primitive to consider it
to be equal to human life?

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
And here, I would not,
unlike my political views,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
be forward enough to venture
an opinion because it's really

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
something that no one really can
argue about in any objective way.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
It's all a matter of opinion.
Is this a human being already,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
or is it simply an inanimate
cluster, a clump of cells?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Now, in principal,
how could we do this?

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
How could we actually create
this kind of tissue therapy?

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Because the fact is, as you get
older, your tissues start falling

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
apart. You haven't
experienced that.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
But I have. And the fact is that
even if you try to stay in shape,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
things just start falling
apart. And the older you get,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
the more they fall apart.
Even people who eat well,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
which I do, and exercise well,
which I don't, even they fall apart.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
And so the question is, are there
way of replacing and repairing

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.000
tissue? And this would, in
principal, represent one such

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
strategy because it means that you
could possibly inject replacement

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.000
cells into an agent tissue and
generate cells which could then

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
restore and regeneration function
which has somehow inevitably

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
deteriorated over the decades.
Well, that raises the question of

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
how you can actually get a
blastocyst, how you can make a

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
blastocyst like this. To state
an obvious thing which you

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000
might already have intuited,
let's say you had such cells

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000
differentiated from various cell
types that you want to inject into

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000
somebody's muscle or into their
liver if they had diabetes and had

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.000
lost their beta cells, or
into their cartilage if they

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
banged up their knee during
basketball practice or something

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
like that, or jogging, which
is allegedly good for you.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Who knows? How could you deal
with that? Well, the fact is,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
let's imagine there were such a
blastocyst which we'd produce in

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
this fashion that we
differentiated like this.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
OK, this is now the sequence
of events. There's an important

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
consideration we have to take
into account, and that is if this

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
blastocyst came from a
different person than you,

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
and we induced these
cells to differentiate,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
and we injected those
differentiation cells into your

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
muscle, things wouldn't work.
Why? Because these cells, if the

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000
blastocyst originated in a different
person than yourself would be

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
genetically different from you,
and would be recognized as foreign

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000
tissue by your immune system. So
even though you were getting an

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
injection of cells which could
regenerate your muscle perfectly

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000
well, those cells would never
be given a chance to establish

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
themselves and to thrive, and
to reconstruct the tissue simple

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
because the immune system would
regard those cells as being

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
foreigners and would go after them
hammer and tongs trying to get rid

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
of them in the same way it tries
to get rid of all kinds of foreign

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
invaders. I.e. the only
way you could avoid it is

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.000
if this blastocyst was
genetically identical to you.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000
But how can you make a blastocyst
which is genetically identical to

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000
you? Well, I'm glad I asked that
question. That's really the big

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
challenge we have here because we
don't want to create a situation

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
where we have to restore somebody's
tissues, but the only way we can

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
restore them is to leave them
immunosuppressed for the rest of

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
their lives. When I say
immunosuppressed I mean we have to

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
prevent their immune system from
attacking all of these cells that

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
we've injected in them, these
foreign cells, in the same way

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
that we have to suppress the
immune system of any person who has

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
received a graft from another
individual including often bone

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000
marrow transplants. In all
cases, we have at least for a

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000
while to prevent their immune system
from attacking and eliminating these

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
engrafted cells. And this
is where the whole strategy

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
comes for the whole process of
cloning. You may recall the case of

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Dolly about five years ago,
and let's remember what happened

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
here because this would a momentous
experiment in mammalian biology.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
It asked the question, really, if
you take cells from a somatic tissue,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
from here, or here, or
here, are those cells,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
in principal, still totipotent,
i.e. is the nucleus, is the genome

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
of those cells totipotent, or
has the genome, the chromosomal

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000
complement of cells in their cells
undergone some kind of irrevocable,

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
irreversible change, which
precludes those cells from ever

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
becoming totipotent?
Well, in fact,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
if you take mammary epithelial cells
from the breast of a human being or

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
from the breast of a ewe and
you put them into the blastocyst,

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
nothing's going to happen. Those
introduced mammary epithelial

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
cells will not be able to establish
themselves in the blastocyst.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000
And, we will not be able to
insinuate themselves amidst the

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
inner cell mass, and
they will not be able to

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
participate in embryogenesis. So
therefore, the epigenetic program

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
in these somatic cells seems to
be irrevocably set to preclude the

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
participation of the already
differentiated mammary epithelial

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
cells in subsequent embryogenesis.
Therefore, you could not do this

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
experiment all over again of
introducing cells into the inner

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000
cell mass as I just described over
here, injecting them into this.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000
But still, that doesn't answer the
question. The issue is not whether

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
the mammary epithelial cell is
irrevocably committed to being a

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
mammary epithelial cell. The
issue: is its genome capable

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
under the proper circumstances of
becoming an early embryonic cell.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
And therefore, what was done is
the following. One took mammary

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
epithelial cells, in this
case from Dolly's quote

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
unquote "mother, one
prepared nuclei from these

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
cells, taking them out of the
cytoplasm, and then one got

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:38.000
fertilized eggs or eggs that
have been induced to become.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
So here's an oocyte. An
oocyte is an unfertilized egg.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
In principle, you can activate
an oocyte by putting a sperm in,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
or in fact it's actually better if
you take the oocyte and you fool it

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.000
into thinking it's become fertilized
by treating it with different salts,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.000
high potassium
concentration, and so forth.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And that will induce the egg
to say I've been fertilized.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
I better start embryogenesis. But
what you do in this case is the

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
following. The egg has its
own haploid nucleus here,

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:18.000
and you can take a little needle.
And, you suck that nucleus right

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:23.000
out of the egg. So,
you've enucleated it.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
That's what you've done,
and now the egg is enucleate.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
It doesn't have a nucleus
in it. But keep in mind,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
much of what happens during early
embryogenesis is programmed not only

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
by the genes but by all array
of cytoplasmic proteins that are

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
present throughout the egg,
and which play critical roles in

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
determining the subsequent
course of embryogenesis.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
So now what you can do is you
inject into this enucleate oocyte

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
the nucleus of a
mammary epithelial cell.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
The mammary epithelial cell is
obviously highly differentiated.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
It's there to make milk. We'll
call it an MEC if you want,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
and you put that in there, and
under certain circumstances,

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
and then you can treat this with
a little bit of salt to mimic the

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
physiological stimulus that comes
after the sperm hits the egg.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
And now this egg will
think it's been fertilized.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And now it will begin to divide.
But keep in mind, the genome of

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
this quote unquote "unfertilized
egg" has come not from the sperm and

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
the preexisting nucleus of the egg.
It's come because the nucleus has

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
been injected from a
mammary epithelial cell.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
An experience over the last 30
years had indicated that this will

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
never work. But finally somebody in
Scotland, a man named Ian Wilmouth

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
tinkered enough with the conditions
of these cells that he could

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
actually get it to work not
so often, maybe one, or two,

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:10.000
or three times out of 100
tries. But on those conditions,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
this thing would begin to divide.
The nucleus would begin to divide

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
its diploid. Keep in mind that
when a sperm comes into an egg,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
the egg is haploid. The sperm
is haploid. Together they make a

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
diploid genome. This
introduced genomus diploid,

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
and the question is, the critical
question is, can the genes in this

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
introduced nucleus totally rearrange
their transcriptional program so

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
that even though these genes might
all be intact in terms of nucleotide

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
sequence, can the entire infinitely
complex array of DNA associated

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
proteins, I.e. the
proteins that constitute

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
the chromatin which is not only the
histones but also the transcription

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
factors, the TF's, can they
all jump on and jump off as

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
they should to mimic and replicate
the spectrum of transcription

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
factors that is normally present
shortly after an egg is fertilized?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
If they can do that, then
this embryo can begin to

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
replicate, and can ultimately
develop into a complete embryo.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
If they can't, then embryogenesis
is going to be truncated shortly

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
thereafter maybe at the two cell
stage, at the four cell stage,

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
at the 16 cell stage, but shortly
thereafter, not because of the DNA

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
sequences being defective,
but because the spectrum of

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
transcription factors is up and down
regulates certain genes is in fact

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
not been able to re-assort
themselves in response to what?

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Initially, in response to the
signals coming from the cytoplasm

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
because one might imagine,
correctly so, that the nucleus in

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
here is getting signals from
the cytoplasm telling it,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
in effect, telling this nucleus,
you should behave functionally as if

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
you were the nucleus of a
fertilized egg. In other words,

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000
the environment of proteins
here is influencing the behavior

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
of this nucleus. That goes
backwards to our normal

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000
way of thinking because keep in mind
our normal vectoral way of thinking

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.000
is that the nucleus is
influencing the cytoplasm.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000
That's the direction of
information flow. But here,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
we're having a different situation.
Here, the cytoplasm is telling this

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.000
injected nucleus, well,
you used to be a mammary

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
epithelial cell nucleus, but
now you've got to take on a

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000
different job. And we're
going to force you to do

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
so. And to the
extent that happens,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
then in principle, one can
end up having a normal embryo.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
And, it happened actually on
rare occasion that this worked.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Here they used actual electrical
stimulus rather than salt to get the

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
nucleus to divide. This
electrical stimulus,

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
again, was to mimic the stimulus
that the sperm entering the egg

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
normally provides, thereby
activating the egg and

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
forcing the entire
fertilized egg to proliferate.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000
And so, once this starts developing,
let's say, the blastocyst stage,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
here we have a blastocyst.
You can see the inner cell mass

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
once again here. This
can be transferred into a

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
pseudo-pregnant ewe.
Pseudo-pregnant means you take a

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
female ewe and you inject it with a
series of hormones that persuade her

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
reproductive system including
prolactin, and progesterone,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
or estrogen, persuade
her reproductive system,

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
her uterus, that she's pregnant.
You inject this early embryo into

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
her, and this early embryo will then
implant into the wall of her uterus

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
and begin to develop.
And if it all works well,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
you get a Dolly is born. You get
a new sheep coming out of this.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
It doesn't work so often, one,
two, three, four times after out of

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
a hundred, and very often in
the great majority of cases,

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000
there are mis-births, mis-carriages,
which happen in the middle of

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
embryogenesis. So, almost
in the great majority of

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
cases, this fails. Somehow,
the reprogramming of this

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
nucleus, which is what we're talking
about, reprogramming it in terms of

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
its transcriptional program,
goes awry. And therefore, bad

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:17.000
things happen. The fact
that on a rare occasion

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
gets and succeeds here already is
extremely interesting because it

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
proves irrevocably that the genome
of a mammary epithelial cell is in

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
principle competent to program
entire embryonic development.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
And that means that during the
development of Dolly's mother,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
we'll put her up here, as she
developed from one cell into 1,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
00 or 10,000 billion cells, as
that development occurred the DNA

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
sequences that went from the
fertilized egg to her didn't really

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000
change. I.e. the DNA sequences
that were in one of her mammary

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
epithelial cells were intact,
and as capable in principle of

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000
launching the full-fledged
development as would be

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
a fertilized egg. And
that is one of the proofs,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
by the way, that in fact
differentiation does not involve,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
with some rare exceptions,
alterations in DNA sequence.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
This, in turn, ends up being
connected with the whole issue of

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
embryonic stem cells. Let's
say that I wanted to have my

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
muscles regenerated, although
they're still pretty good.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
So, I take a skin cell of mine,
and I inject the skin cell.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000
I take the nucleus out, and
I inject it into an oocyte.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
And then I let the oocyte
develop up to this stage.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
And I don't put the oocyte back
into a sheep or another woman,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
although I could in principle. I
actually take the cells out of the

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
inner cell mass.
Those are ES cells,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
and I begin to use them to
regenerate my muscles to do this

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:59.000
strategy. So, the
cells are, in this case,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000
not used for reproductive cloning,
which is what this is here.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000
They're used for therapeutic cloning,
where instead of taking these cells

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
and the ES cells and allowing
them to form a whole embryo,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
they're used to form a cell line
of ES cells from the blastocyst from

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
the inner cell mass. What
we talked about before,

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
here you see the blastocyst
with the inner cell mass here.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
You see it again. But now, rather
than allowing this blastocyst

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:31.000
to continue development, we
simply extract cells from it and

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
again create ES cells. I
could create therefore in

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
principle, ES cells, which
are genetically identical to

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
all the cells in my body, and
any one of you could as well.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
And here, there's not only one, but
there's two ethical complications.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
First of all, here we're starting
human life with the intent of

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000
truncating it very early, and
secondly, where are the oocytes

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
going to come from? Well,
you could say you can get

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
them from some women, but
producing oocytes from a human

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
female isn't so easy. You
have to inject her with all

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
kinds of stimulatory hormones,
choreogramatatrophic hormones. It's

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
an unpleasant procedure.
Usually women are paid $5,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
00 or $10,000 to produce
some oocytes. Well,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000
you say, that's OK, but
is that OK? I don't know.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Is it OK to pay a woman to donate
her oocytes to make herself into an

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
oocyte factory? I don't
know. You have to judge.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
I think there's arguments
both for and against it.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Clearly, any one of us would be
extraordinarily naïve if we thought

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
that this was a procedure which
had no ethical encumbrances in it.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
And, you have to think about
them for yourself. Still,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
the potentials are enormous, and
therefore the question exists.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Will there be ways in the future
of taking differentiated cells from

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
one's tissue, and in fact using
them in these ways to make ES cells

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
without having to go through an
oocyte, and without having the

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
potential of creating human life.
The alternative to this has been to

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
do the following, to go
into our normal tissues and

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
pull out adult stem cells. What
do I mean by adult stem cells?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:18.000
These are not stem cells that are
totipotent. These are stem cells

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
which are in my muscles and
regenerating muscle mass,

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
which happens believe it or not.
These are stem cells which might be

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
in my skin and are continually
regenerating skin cells.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Keep in mind that in the maintenance
of all our normal tissues there are

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
stem cells whose configuration can
formally be depicted like this with

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
the transit amplifying
cells we talked about before.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
And maybe, if one took the stem
cells out of an adult tissue right

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.000
here, if we had a way of extracting
them, those could be propagated in

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
vitro, and then injected back
in. Those are so-called adult stem

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
cells. And the
individuals who are against

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
this kind of manipulation of human
embryos and so forth say that adult

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
stem cells are really the solution.
You take stem cells out of a

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
person's tissue, you expand
them. Ex vivo means out

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
of the body, in vitro, and
then you use them. You inject

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
them into somebody's tissue
to regenerate their tissue.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000
There's only one problem with that.
It's ethically far less encumbered

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000
obviously, but it doesn't
work that well. In fact,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
some people think it hardly works at
all, that the exceptions are really

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:36.000
rather far and few between. And
so, this issue will long be or

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.000
continue to be debated. But
it obviously represents a very

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:46.000
new and exciting area of biomedical
research. And interestingly enough,

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.000
it impinges as well in a fully
unexpected way on cancer because

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.000
this whole paradigm of stem cells,
it turns out, also applies to cancer

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
cells. If you were to
have asked me two or

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
three years ago, what did
the cells in the tumor look

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
like? I would draw a picture like
this, that these are a series of

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:12.000
exponentially growing cells
so that all the cancer cells,

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
all the neoplastic cells in
the tumor mass are biologically

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
equivalent to one another.
They all have the same mutant

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000
genome, and they all are capable
of multiplying exponentially.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.000
But it turns out that work in the
Matavoidic system on Matevoidic

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
tumors like leukemias,
and now on breast cancers,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
yields a very different results,
because it turns out that the way

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:44.000
that the tumors are organized
looks like this. The tumors also are

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:52.000
organized in this hierarchical
array just like normal tissue.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:00.000
How do we know that? Again,
I'm glad I asked that question.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Because if you take these cells out
of the tumor and put them in another

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.000
mouse, let's say,
you get a new tumor.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:13.000
These cells are tumorogenic,
I.e. they concede a new tumor.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
If you take these cells out of the
tumor, they have the same mutant

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:21.000
genome. They constitute the bulk,
the vast mass of the cancer cells in

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000
a tumor. You put these into a
mouse, and they're non-tumorogenic.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And, in some kinds of tumors, the
tumorogenic cells can represent

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:35.000
only 1 or 2% of the total mass
of cancer cells in the tumor.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And from this, we begin
to realize that you look

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
inside tumors: the tumors deviate
minimally from the organization of

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000
normal tissue. They also
depend on self-renewing

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
stem cells which can make transit
amplifying cells and can give end

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
stage cells, which although
they're neoplastic, have many of the

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
differentiated characteristics of
the normal tissue from which they

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
arose. And this has
enormous implications for,

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
for example, therapies
against tumors.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
If you ask somebody, how do
you develop and how you judge

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
the success of an anticancer
treatment? You talk to somebody

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
like from the pharmaceutical
industry. And let's say that's easy.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
If you have a new drug, and
that drug reduces the mass of a

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
tumor by 50%, that means that
you've done something really good.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
But let's look what's going on here.
If these cells are 99% of the tumor

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000
in terms of the mass and these
cells are 1% of the tumor,

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.000
let's say you've invented a new drug
which wipes out all of these cells

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
but doesn't touch these cells. The
bulk of the tumor has shrunk and

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
everybody will say, eureka,
we've succeeded in curing

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
cancer. But keep in mind that the
self-renewing capacity of the tumor

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
rests in these cells. And
if these cells are allowed to

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:57.000
survive, then they'll start
proliferating again and regenerate

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
the entire tumor mass. And
you won't really know that you

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
had any success because these cells
look like all the other tumor cells

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
under the microscope. But
biologically, they're very

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
different. And therefore,
the future of cancer therapy,

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.000
and it will take five or ten years
to do this, has to begin to focus on

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
getting rid of these self-renewing
stem cells which create this

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000
enormous regenerative
capacity on the part of tumors.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:32.000
See you next Monday.
Have a great vacation.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Eat much turkey, and get some
exercise, and don't smoke.

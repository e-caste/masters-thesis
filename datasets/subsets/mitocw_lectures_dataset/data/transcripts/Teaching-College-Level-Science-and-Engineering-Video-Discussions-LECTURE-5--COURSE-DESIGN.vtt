00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.750
PROFESSOR: Welcome to Course
Design today, how to plan a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.630
course and avoid the pitfalls
that many courses fall into.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.230
In the past few sessions we've
seen some of the results, for

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.470
example the misconceptions,
the rote

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.410
learning, the lack of transfer.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.000
And how do you design a course
so that your course doesn't

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.190
commit more of that and
contribute to that problem,

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.980
but instead perhaps
mitigates it?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.220
And it's a difficult problem.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.890
So related to that, sort of
flowing almost directly from

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.680
course design is that making
large changes to courses is

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.020
politically very difficult.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.330
And several people have asked
me questions about that.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.160
So actually the penultimate
session will be political

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.730
barriers to educational
change.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.420
So for example, the Benezet
experiment, what happened to

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.490
Benezet's experiment?

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.890
Why isn't it done more?

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.370
So actually, I went to the
Manchester School Board,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.590
Manchester, New Hampshire, and
looked at all the school board

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.010
minutes from the 1930s
to see what happened.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.110
So I'll talk a bit about that,
talk about what are the

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.790
structural obstacles to change
so that you know what you're

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.270
up against so that you can make
strategic, sly choices

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.710
and not get yourself
shot at too much.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.270
But that's sort of
a consequence

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.600
of good course design.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.440
And that we'll do in the
penultimate session.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.670
This time we'll talk about if
you had your ideal world, what

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.220
would you do?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.270
Sort of a process of successive
approximation.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.000
In the ideal world what
would you do?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.180
And then in the real world,
how do you get as close to

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.680
that as you can?

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:14.220
So today, course design, which
is how do you design a course

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.360
so that you avoid the
main problems with

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.500
the traditional courses?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.270
So now before I say how do you
design a course like that, let

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.100
me review a bit.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.390
We've seen some of it in
the previous sessions.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.705
But what are the problems with
the traditional courses?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.990
So the problems in the
traditional courses in broad

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:55.490
outlines are, one,
rote learning.

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.390
I think that's the most
fundamental problem.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.530
So we've seen many
examples of that.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.790
And I'll just remind
you of a few.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.080
And I'll show you a couple.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.820
So I'll remind you
of a few just to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.140
summarize it in one second.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.535
And related to rote learning is
that there's no transfer.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.740
So what are the causes?

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.150
Well, we'll come to
that in a second.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.200
But for example, what do I
mean by rote learning?

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.790
So rote learning is the
fundamental problem.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.600
And it actually causes
this one.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.830
If you learn by pattern
matching, you're not going to

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.770
be able to transfer to a new
situation unless you happen to

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.270
have by luck seen that
pattern before.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.670
But any really new situation
will be completely unfamiliar

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.160
and you won't be
able to do it.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.820
So the examples--

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:23.280
so the canonical example,
because I find this actually

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.360
very helpful to have a canonical
example of what is

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.600
rote learning, I think this
is the canonical example.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.480
It's that.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.820
So I have that picture in my
mind and the whole story

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.700
behind that picture
is this one.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.560
So this is from Wertheimer
again.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.370
So students are learning to
find the area of this

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.130
parallelogram.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:02.420
And they move that triangle over
there, make a rectangle.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.820
They know how to find the
area of the rectangle.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.150
So rote learning, you can test
for rote learning by giving

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.560
them this picture.

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.420
And the students who didn't
understand but it only seemed

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:18.486
like they understand, they take
the triangle and they

00:05:18.486 --> 00:05:20.660
don't know what to do with it.

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.840
So they can't find the area
anymore, because what this

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.350
reveals is that they didn't
actually understand what they

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.210
were doing.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.290
They didn't understand that the
purpose of this procedure

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.700
was to make a rectangle because
you know how to find

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.890
the area of a rectangle.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.210
They thought what you do is
you chop off the left

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.190
triangle, move it over there,
and then you do

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.240
some w times h.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.520
So operationally, it looks
almost exactly the same.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.650
But cognitively, underneath,
what's going on under the

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.720
hood, is something completely
different, you find out, when

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.300
students have done rote
learning, because they can't

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.320
do this problem.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:05.400
So this one actually has all
aspects of rote learning.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.610
So if they can't even do this
problem, they haven't even

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:08.730
done any learning.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.830
But if they can do this one but
not this one, they've done

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.300
rote learning.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.900
OK.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.990
So now if they haven't done
any learning, that's a

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.650
completely separate problem,
generally not

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:17.515
the problem we have.

00:06:17.515 --> 00:06:20.740
We have problems with students
who have done way too much

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.120
learning, but it's all in
the wrong direction.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.280
So that's one example.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.800
Have I shown you folks--

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.880
probably some of you, the
Army bus problem?

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.340
The Army bus problem
is very amusing.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:44.290
So there are 1,128 soldiers.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.150
And they have to be bused from
one base to another.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:52.950
So this actually, again, was
another National Assessment of

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.180
Educational Progress problem.

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.310
So it was given to
a sample of about

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.950
50,000 high school students.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.710
So it was a huge study.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.430
And there's 36 per bus
that you can take.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:07.590
So the question is,
how many buses?

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.700
So it's not a rocket
science question.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.000
They're just supposed to figure
out how many buses to

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.660
use and maybe one is the
right answer, maybe.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.820
But you just keep shuttling
back and forth.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.110
Let's assume that's not
what was looked for.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.360
So I'll just give you this.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.560
So 1,128 over 36
is 31 and 1/3.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.350
So now I'm giving you that
basically to simulate the

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.250
state of mind of the students,
because it turns out about 70%

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.670
of the students did this
division correctly.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.450
So now there's another
30% who didn't even

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.820
learn division correctly.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.080
Let's leave those
people aside.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.930
Of the 70%, in other words most
of them, who could do the

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:01.670
division correctly,
what did they say?

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.960
OK.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.720
So take a minute.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.270
Find a neighbor and see if you
can predict what the students

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.990
say and what the distribution
of answers is.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:13.130
So this is practice
understanding where students

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.320
are coming from.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.020
This is American high
school students.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.935
OK.

00:08:21.935 --> 00:08:25.350
So can someone suggest one
answer that people gave?

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.452
Yes.

00:08:29.452 --> 00:08:32.049
AUDIENCE: Actually 31
[INAUDIBLE] buses.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:32.490
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.130
So that was one of
the answers.

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.950
So actually, the way that in
America at least when I was in

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:45.380
school you were taught to
write it as 31 R 12.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:48.530
So that means 31 remainder 12,
which I think is a completely

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:49.760
broken way of doing things.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.230
But that's what we learned
in school.

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:54.140
And that's what some fraction
of students wrote.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.630
OK.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.450
Another answer.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.380
AUDIENCE: 31.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:57.660
PROFESSOR: 31.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.130
AUDIENCE: 31 because
they round off.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:01.440
PROFESSOR: 31 to round off.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.375
And another one?

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:03.830
AUDIENCE: 32.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.450
PROFESSOR: 32 would be nice.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:07.810
Right.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:09.770
So these in fact were
the three answers.

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.340
And they were all equally
chosen, except for this was

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.050
sort of slightly preferred
to the others.

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.720
So they were all roughly
25% of--

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.260
this was, say, 75%.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:21.330
These were all about 25%.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.730
I think this was 28%.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.200
So this one was the
winning one.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:30.520
Now just stare at that
for a minute.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.960
What does that tell you?

00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.920
It tells you that-- what it
tells me is that the problem

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.490
had no meaning for
the students.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:40.900
Again, they'd done learning.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.560
So of the rite learning,
they'd done learning.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.290
There's no question
about that.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.760
They'd learn how to divide.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.050
They all could divide.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.540
But they didn't know what
the hell they'd done.

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.970
So if you wrote, oh, yeah,
if you filled out on the

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:57.250
requisition form for the Army
I need 31 R 12 buses, where

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:57.670
would you be?

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.220
You'd probably be peeling
potatoes for the

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.720
next week, on KP duty.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.800
So this shows no meaning.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.950
And what it shows is that for
most students, there was

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:11.930
actually no meaning.

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:19.310
Here, again this also shows
no meaning, but in a more

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:20.610
sophisticated way than this.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.390
At least they thought about
what to do with the R 12.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.920
And they came up with the
wrong answer, but they

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.260
thought about it.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.415
And here, we'll hope they
actually understood.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.050
So of the 100%, 30% couldn't
do the division.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.990
Roughly another 20%,
it had no meaning.

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.230
Another 30%, no meaning.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.000
So now we're at 80%.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.040
And only about 20% really
understood what was going on

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.100
in a really fundamentally
simple problem.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:57.970
So that is a striking example
to me of how deep the rote

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.340
learning is.

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.020
It's the same as that problem I
showed you last time, which

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.040
was 3.04 times 5.3,
I think it was.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:07.290
You had to multiply.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.770
And students had to choose--

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:14.030
they had to estimate it.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.080
They didn't actually have
to do the calculation.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:21.100
They had to choose between
1.6, 16, 160,

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:22.920
one of these four.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.960
And it was just chance,
basically.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.230
So again, the number
system didn't

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.100
mean anything to people.

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.090
So it's really fundamental.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.480
It's really terrible.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.780
And it's been studied a lot.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.430
So the problem is not just
in American teaching.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.410
It's across the world.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.270
It shows up in physics.

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:47.790
So the physics example I
showed you was this.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.160
So this is the bouncing ball.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.550
So it's stationary just for an
instant while it's bouncing.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.520
And what everyone drew
was that there was--

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:26.380
normal force equals
mg and there's mg.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.320
Why?

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.680
Well, v equals zero.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:36.730
So there's several reasons.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.820
Here, partly there was rote
learning involved, because n

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:42.590
was always equal to mg in all
these other problems.

00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:44.600
So they just triggered
off of that.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.715
The other one is that there
is indeed misconception.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.370
They actually think
f equals mv.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.520
So that's the third.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.300
So here, there's deep
rote learning.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.200
There's no transfer.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.340
What are the causes?

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.417
So there you see one
of the causes.

00:13:07.417 --> 00:13:08.391
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:09.641
[INAUDIBLE].

00:13:12.287 --> 00:13:15.696
Couldn't it also be a problem
of multiple choice thing,

00:13:15.696 --> 00:13:17.160
because [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.320
PROFESSOR: It wasn't
multiple choice.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.620
They were just given the
problem just like this.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.080
No.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.040
I don't think anyone who made
a multiple choice would ever

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.752
have dreamt to put that
one on there.

00:13:28.752 --> 00:13:30.360
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean
this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:38.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.910
But I think it was phrased like
how many buses should you

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.070
order, something like that.

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:44.566
I mean, they should come
up with some integer.

00:13:44.566 --> 00:13:45.900
AUDIENCE: They would write in an
answer that they would get.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:46.390
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:48.960
No, it was a blank, not
a multiple choice.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.040
It was a short answer.

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.600
So that's how they could see
that they'd done the division

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.390
correctly or not.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:57.140
And so all of the ones who had
done the division correctly,

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.700
this is what you got.

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.455
Another question?

00:14:00.455 --> 00:14:00.750
No.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:02.078
OK.

00:14:02.078 --> 00:14:02.572
Question.

00:14:02.572 --> 00:14:03.560
AUDIENCE: So I have
another question.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.512
You've shown us many studies
that prove that there's more

00:14:07.512 --> 00:14:08.500
rote learning going on.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.280
And all those studies come from
the '30s and the '60s.

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.400
So why is it still
a problem today?

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:14.710
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:21.840
So this one was '84, I
believe, '83 or '84.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.690
And let's see, when were
some of the others?

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.430
So Wertheimer was the
'50s or the '40s.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:28.540
Those examples are the '40s,
so yeah, you're right.

00:14:32.725 --> 00:14:34.590
AUDIENCE: Why is it
still a problem?

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:38.560
PROFESSOR: Well, every time
I ask this one, I

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.380
get the same results.

00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:46.320
So this I've asked between 1998
and 2009, and always got

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.680
the same results.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.570
What are some of the others?

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.960
So another one is quel
age est le capitaine?

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.680
So that's a French study.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.210
So they asked students--

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.360
the question was, how
do we know it's

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.210
still a problem today?

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.460
So they've asked students,
there are 26 sheep and 10

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.580
goats on a ship.

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.850
How old is the captain?

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.160
It's a good question.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.630
The problem is the answer.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:15.940
The answer is that people answer
36, because they have

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.860
to stir the numbers around
somehow and get something.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.050
So that was done in the
'80s, I believe.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.690
Yes?

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:22.550
AUDIENCE: That's not quite
what I'm asking.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.910
I'm asking, if there is so much
evidence that supports

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:28.390
the existence of the problem,
why isn't it solved?

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:29.270
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:29.540
OK.

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:30.490
Good question.

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.850
OK.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:33.000
Sorry.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.830
I thought your question was,
wasn't it all done long ago so

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:38.140
it's not a problem now.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.750
Oh, yeah.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.080
If there's so much evidence to
support the existence of a

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.980
problem, why isn't it solved?

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.510
So I would say there's two
parts to that answer.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:52.480
One part is that, a, lots of
people don't know about this.

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.150
So normally when you teach--

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.820
so there's sort of an implicit
contract, which is that if I

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.810
don't ask you questions like
that, you won't reveal to me

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.010
that I'm not teaching you any
of these important things.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:09.770
So for example, if you just take
a regular course, it's

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.710
actually possible to do
all the problems by

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:14.450
pattern-matching, mostly.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:18.090
So as an example in physics,
you'll have--

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.310
say you're doing circular
motion.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.620
And someone will say, well,
there's a car going around a

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.740
turn and the radius of
the turn is this.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.800
And it's going at 30
miles an hour.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.768
What's the force?

00:16:30.768 --> 00:16:34.432
Or the car has a mass, m, what's
the force that the road

00:16:34.432 --> 00:16:36.410
has to exert to keep
it in the turn?

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.860
Well, you don't have
to know anything

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.260
about circular motion.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:42.800
All you have to know is that
there must be some formula

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.580
which has-- so let's
look at the

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.220
variables that I just said.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.070
There is F is the unknown.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.660
m is given.

00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.344
v is given.

00:16:55.344 --> 00:16:58.190
And r is given.

00:16:58.190 --> 00:17:00.860
So you just flip through the
book until you find a formula

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.550
with all of those guys, which
happens to be F equals mv

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.160
squared over r.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.859
And then you just plug
everything in.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:09.869
So you can do all those problems
without understanding

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:12.780
anything about centrifugal
and centripetal.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.760
For example, 95% of students who
can find this formula with

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.069
no problem, if you ask them,
well, can you draw me a force

00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:25.510
diagram, 50/50 on whether the
force is outwards or inwards.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:27.940
You can ask them things like,
OK, a car is accelerating.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.190
Where does the force
come from?

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.150
Or a car is decelerating.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:35.120
Where does the force
come from?

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.450
Oh, you know, the road.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.410
That seems really strange.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:37.890
But it's true.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.830
It's in fact from the road.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.010
So they have huge misconceptions
even about

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.060
linear forces, let alone
circular forces.

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:49.300
So the regular way of teaching
actually doesn't expose those.

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:49.785
Yes?

00:17:49.785 --> 00:17:52.280
AUDIENCE: Do you think if the
standardized exams had

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.622
higher-level questions
on them.

00:17:54.622 --> 00:17:57.782
like Bloom's Taxonomy, would
that help [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:01.230
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:02.310
That would help, actually.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.150
So I can say something
about how--

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:05.710
maybe I should've said this
last time, about how--

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.070
so the question was, if
standardized exams were better

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.220
and had higher-level questions,
would that help?

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.900
I think it would help.

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:15.190
And you can still even do it
multiple choice and still have

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:16.080
higher-level questions.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.264
So here's actually a pretty
striking example.

00:18:20.264 --> 00:18:21.990
Let's see if I can
remember exactly.

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.340
Oh, yeah.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.730
So you ask students--

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.000
these are young kids, but
it applies generally.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.140
And it's a question about
how to design tests.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:37.640
So you ask them, I have a piece
of red cellophane and

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.810
blue cellophane.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.450
And I put them together.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.760
What color do I get?

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:44.110
OK.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.300
So now the question isn't so
much what is the right answer?

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.940
But what do you think students
say when you ask them that?

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.090
And these are young kids.

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:56.525
So takes a minute and see if you
come up with what they say

00:18:56.525 --> 00:18:59.310
as their answer, their
most common answer.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.280
So you ask this as an
open-ended question.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.740
You don't give them
multiple choice.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.410
So talk to your neighbor
about that.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.660
OK.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:17.200
So I think it's actually very
difficult to predict what

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.210
students actually say.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:21.120
And I'm willing to eat
a chalk if anyone--

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.710
well, I don't know if
I should say that.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:25.450
That's a bit risky.

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.210
But let's just-- chalk
is probably safe.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:29.540
But let's say I'm willing to eat
a chalk, maybe with salt

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:32.450
and pepper, if anyone can
actually figure out what the

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.590
students actually said, the main
thing they say, because

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:37.920
it's really, really
counterintuitive.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:39.480
Yes?

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.500
Oh, go ahead.

00:19:40.500 --> 00:19:40.810
AUDIENCE: Reddish-blue.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:41.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:42.847
So reddish-blue is one thing.

00:19:42.847 --> 00:19:44.097
Yeah.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.420
So that's one answer they give.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.140
Yeah.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:50.986
Yes?

00:19:50.986 --> 00:19:51.680
AUDIENCE: Brown.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.420
PROFESSOR: Brown.

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.910
Yes, they probably
do say that.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:58.190
AUDIENCE: Reddish-blue
is like violet?

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.752
PROFESSOR: Reddish-blue
is like violet.

00:19:59.752 --> 00:20:01.020
Yeah.

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:03.260
But if they are young enough,
they might not know of the

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.210
color violet.

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.610
They might, or purple.

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:07.236
Yeah.

00:20:07.236 --> 00:20:09.560
AUDIENCE: I'll go with
saying violet-purple.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.050
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:11.300
So violet-purple.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.370
Yes?

00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:16.940
AUDIENCE: Yellow.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:17.420
PROFESSOR: Yellow.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.440
I'm still safe.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.610
So they do say all these.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.450
I don't know about all of them
in particular, but they say

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:23.290
most of these things.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.830
I'm so far safe from
my chalk wager.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:26.110
Yes?

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.890
AUDIENCE: Blue.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:27.340
PROFESSOR: Blue.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.590
OK.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:34.600
Yes?

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.540
AUDIENCE: Black.

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.480
PROFESSOR: Black.

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.716
That would be nice.

00:20:37.716 --> 00:20:38.708
Yeah.

00:20:38.708 --> 00:20:39.700
Yes?

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:42.180
AUDIENCE: Would they say it
depends which one is on top?

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.390
PROFESSOR: Uh-oh.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.640
I've got to eat my chalk.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:46.770
Yes.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.830
So does it matter
which one's--

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.090
yeah.

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.320
In particular, they say,
which one's on top?

00:20:59.770 --> 00:21:01.020
Can I have salt with that?

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:08.950
So that is in fact the
main question.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:12.780
So now why do I bring
this question up?

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.320
Well, the normal way you'd
make a multiple choice

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.970
question is you'd ask the
question yourself.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:20.510
You'd think, well, what are
the plausible answers?

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:24.230
You'd come up with many
of the choices here.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.420
And you'd put them down in
the multiple choice.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:29.970
And you'd never think of
putting this one there.

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:34.300
So one way to actually design
the questions is that you

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:37.950
first do it with a pilot group
with a short answer.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:41.360
And then you make your multiple
choices based on the

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.270
main misconceptions
that they have.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.550
OK.

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:47.550
So now what's the obstacle
when you do this?

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:51.440
The obstacle when you do this
is you get this very funny

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.720
item response curve.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.420
So the item response curve
is the following.

00:21:58.330 --> 00:22:00.519
So the idea response curve
you get, so it--

00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:13.230
OK.

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:17.130
So on this axis is the student's
overall grade.

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:18.880
And this is the--

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:29.630
so you have a test say, of
50 questions or whatever.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.690
And this is their overall
grade on this axis.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.990
On this axis is their
probability of getting one

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.590
particular question correct.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.910
So now, a usual, a normal
question is

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.760
something like that.

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:49.660
If they don't know anything,
they have no chance

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.010
of getting it right.

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:54.140
Maybe they have some monkey
line level over here.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.020
So let's call it something
like that.

00:22:57.020 --> 00:22:57.370
OK.

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.460
But these kind of questions
actually have a

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:00.870
very different shape.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:15.260
Their shape is shaped like a J.
So what happens is that--

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.700
so this is the good questions.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:21.430
I think they are much
better questions.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:23.780
But they get this shape.

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.320
So what happens is when the
students are just guessing,

00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:28.850
they're somewhere down here.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.840
But as they start to think about
it and learn more, then

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.510
they fall into the
misconceptions.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.800
So they actually go down.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:39.480
So they actually can even
be below chance.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.380
And then only when they really
understand things

00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.990
do they get up here.

00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:47.320
So now what happens, for
example, if the SAT ever

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.940
contains a question like this,
they just throw it out.

00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:52.810
They say, oh, this question does
not measure how good a

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:53.850
student we have.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.260
It's actually skewed.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:55.940
It's all messed up.

00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:56.670
So you throw it out.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.240
So these normal, standard ways
of making standardized tests

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:02.310
actually throw out all
the good questions.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.800
And all you're left with is
these kind of questions.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.390
So I actually saw an
example of this in

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.850
Cambridge, which was--

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:14.950
so you remember the rolling down
the plain question that I

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:17.330
showed you last week
or the week before?

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.780
So the rolling down the
plain question is

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:20.530
an intuitive question.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:21.400
It's qualitative.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.990
It's hard.

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.790
If you try to calculate it,
you'll get yourself in a knot

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.240
unless you know exactly
what you're doing.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.150
But if you reason about it
intuitively, you can do it

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:31.200
quite well.

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:31.480
OK.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.490
So that question was then put
on the end-of-year exam for

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:37.930
the sophomores.

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:41.630
And the examiner said, well,
actually this question was not

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:44.260
a good question, because it
didn't measure who the good

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:45.880
students were.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.000
So what they meant was that
the good students actually

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.300
sometimes did worse on
that question than

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.020
the not-so-good students.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:53.640
So they said, OK.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.100
We're just going to throw
that question out.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.410
I mean, they didn't throw
it that time.

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.660
But we're not going to use
questions like that next time.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.550
So again, here you had a good
qualitative question.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:03.460
And it didn't measure the
quote, "good" students.

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:04.970
So it didn't give them
what they wanted.

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:06.150
So they threw it out.

00:25:06.150 --> 00:25:09.320
So if you design a test like
that, you're going to fill it

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.730
with questions that
are just sort of

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.170
low on Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.210
But it doesn't mean you have
to do that it way.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.080
So if you want to make a test
that is higher on Bloom's

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.540
Taxonomy and tests misconception
and qualitative

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:23.440
reasoning and intuitive
reasoning, the way you do it

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.610
is you do a short answer
first, put the main

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.140
misconceptions down.

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:30.160
And you just have to be
willing to live with

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.519
this kind of curve.

00:25:32.519 --> 00:25:36.125
AUDIENCE: But when you say you
don't evaluate the good

00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:39.252
student, but the question is how
do you in the first place

00:25:39.252 --> 00:25:41.750
evaluate the good students
if you have a

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.402
normal kind of system?

00:25:43.402 --> 00:25:46.230
How do you basically
evaluate them?

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:47.960
PROFESSOR: How do you tell who
the good students are?

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:52.050
PROFESSOR: Well, it's a
reification that's going on.

00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:53.500
I mean, there's this idea
that there's such a

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.800
thing as a good student.

00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.320
And just because you call it
that doesn't mean there is

00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.470
such a thing.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.020
So you need some definitions.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.720
So like for example,
what is IQ?

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.630
The definition is it's what
IQ tests measure.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.020
I mean, that's the only,
I would say, valid

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.100
definition of IQ tests.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.090
So here, good student
meant doing well on

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.980
the standard problems.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:15.950
Now, I don't think
that's a good

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.450
definition of a good student.

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:21.220
But that is the implicit
definition in most courses.

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:26.130
So to answer your question, it's
the standard way things

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:30.720
are done, the implicit
definition that it makes it so

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.320
hard to change the rote
learning, but also so hard to

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.940
even see that it's going on.

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.990
And then the other half of
the answer is that--

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:41.330
and when you try to change
it, you find all

00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:43.040
these political obstacles.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.080
And that's what we're going
to talk about in

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.320
the penultimate session.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.590
But for example, people
downstream.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.940
And one question was raised
about this in the questions.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:53.080
The next courses will say, well,
you didn't teach them X.

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:54.760
Suppose you say, oh my god.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:57.590
I'm teaching them sophomore
mechanics and they don't know

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:58.950
Newton's three laws.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:02.580
Well, I could just do oiler's
top and the herpolhodes and

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:07.250
the polhodes, and all of that
stuff and gyroscopes and all

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.340
this complicated stuff, which is
sort of a nonsense if they

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.230
don't understand
Newton's laws.

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.520
Or I could actually sort out
their misconceptions on

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:14.820
Newton's laws.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.940
Well, suppose you take
time to do that.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:17.750
Well, then they haven't
learned what

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:19.710
the herpolhode is.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:22.110
So who knows what the
herpolhode is?

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.620
So I sort of remember
a while ago.

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.800
But even I taught the course
and I hardly remember it.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.320
But the next downstream course
will say, they didn't know the

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:33.230
herpolhode because you spent
time on Newton's laws.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.350
So that's the political
problem.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.270
So you have to then somehow get
the people downstream to

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:40.570
see that this is a serious
problem, that we can only

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.190
build sand castles in the air
for so high before they

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:46.050
collapse because the air can't
support that much.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:47.260
And that's what I'm going
to talk about in

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:49.880
the penultimate session.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.652
Question?

00:27:50.652 --> 00:27:51.902
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:55.032 --> 00:27:58.525
problem, was the purpose of
the test, because if the

00:27:58.525 --> 00:28:02.267
purpose of the test is to
evaluate the students, you

00:28:02.267 --> 00:28:06.030
don't want to throw in
tricky questions.

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:09.040
PROFESSOR: Well, so the question
is which question you

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.230
use, does it depend on the
purpose of the test?

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.970
It does.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.410
But I think you absolutely need
these kind of questions,

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.480
or you're not actually
evaluating the right thing.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.240
So if you only put these kind
of questions in, you're not

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.360
exposing any misconceptions.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.190
So you're actually not
evaluating some of the

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.680
important questions about what
the students understand.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.070
Because, for example, if you
just give them colors on this

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:32.250
question, you'll never realize
that that's what they're

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:33.300
thinking about.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.870
So actually you're just
evaluating can they give you

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:39.150
one of the pre-prescribed
color answers.

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:41.400
But that actually doesn't
necessarily mean that they

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:41.680
understand.

00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.320
So you're not actually
evaluating their

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:43.950
understanding.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.660
So to evaluate understanding
you do need

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:48.160
questions like this.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.750
And should you punish them
for being down here?

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:51.500
No.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.730
That's the other part of it.

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:54.000
If they're down here,
that means they're

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.350
thinking about it.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:57.870
So if you then grade them and
they came down here and you

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.670
say, oh, you did really
badly, no.

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:02.400
Actually you're down here,
that's because you're thinking

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:04.430
about it and you got caught
by the misconception.

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.280
But that's the only way to sort
out the misconception.

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:10.950
You have to go beyond it.

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:11.270
OK.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.080
Other questions?

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.330
And then we'll take a break.

00:29:18.030 --> 00:29:18.450
OK.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.860
So it is 10:05, actually,
according to that

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:25.480
clock, plus an hour.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.690
So 9:15, according
to that clock.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:32.010
So 10:15, see everyone
back here.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:36.510
Take a short, 10-minute break,
just as if it were two 1-hour

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.480
classes with the 10
minute break.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.920
And then I'll put the feedback
sheets in the corners.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.830
So when you come back,
just make sure you

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.460
grab a feedback sheet.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.610
OK.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:55.100
So before, we talked about the
problems with what most

00:29:55.100 --> 00:30:00.230
courses do and how rote learning
is a primary product.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.670
And as a consequence of that,
there's no transfer to new

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.065
situations.

00:30:04.065 --> 00:30:06.680
So the knowledge is
very brittle.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.770
So what are the causes?

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:12.650
And what can you do about it?

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:17.540
So just briefly, the causes
partly are no account is taken

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.330
of the misconceptions
students have.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:26.230
So new rote learning is piled on
old misconceptions, because

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:28.130
by definition learning is
going to turn into rote

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.700
learning if there's no
understanding and meaning

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.690
given to it, just like
the 1,128 divided

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:38.080
by 36 is 31 R 12.

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:41.260
So no account is taken of what
students have rote learned and

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.620
what they've really understood,
because the way

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.660
the course is normally taught,
those ideas, those common

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.930
misconceptions aren't exposed
in the normal run of the way

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.730
the course happens.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:55.310
And another is-- so
that's directly

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:57.950
related to the problem.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:00.530
Another one is that the
applications are very narrow.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.660
So because the applications in
the class are so confined to

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.180
the same area, it's very easy
to produce rote learning.

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:19.530
And so I have a--

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.370
I keep saying how pictures
are the way to understand

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.760
everything.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:24.630
So I have a picture for that.

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.290
So I show everyone
this picture.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:28.890
And if you keep this picture in
your mind, it'll give you a

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.200
guide for how you should
make problems and

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.890
what examples to choose.

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:39.740
So suppose there is some idea
you'd like to teach.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.130
We'll talk in a bit about why
you'd like teach an idea at

00:31:42.130 --> 00:31:46.170
all, but some idea you
want to teach.

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.670
And you have a clear conception
of this idea.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:55.500
For example, maybe the idea is
something like DNA is the

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:59.280
fundamental unit of information
in living systems.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.490
OK, well that means
something to you.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.360
But to the students, it doesn't

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.110
actually mean anything.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.360
You need to give
them examples.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.620
So you're giving them
an example.

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:14.120
A related one is you have
some idea, which

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.005
is dimensional analysis.

00:32:17.005 --> 00:32:19.300
And you want to give them an
example of doing it, because

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.760
just stating the Buckingham pi
theorem for them doesn't

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.550
really help them.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:24.070
So you do an example.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.940
But now picture yourself back
in the student mind.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:28.200
What do the students see?

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.890
Well, they don't have this idea
as a separate unit yet,

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:32.980
because they're still
students.

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.780
And the purpose of the course
is to teach that.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.070
So they haven't got yet.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:41.130
So they have this merger of
idea and example together.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.230
So they see this big package and
have trouble making that

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:47.850
division between idea and
example, in other words,

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:51.790
between transferable idea and
thing that was particular to

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.380
the situation.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:55.090
So of course what do you do?

00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.430
You give them another example.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.490
So the normal way it's done is
here's your second example.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.260
So there's the second example.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:10.360
But now, again from the
student's point of view,

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.730
there's still quite a big
overlap between idea plus

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.015
example one and idea
plus example two.

00:33:20.190 --> 00:33:22.940
So that overlap is--

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.540
if they intersect things
mentally in their head and see

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:29.430
what's common, they still get
a lot of stuff that's beyond

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:30.650
just the idea.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:33.410
For example, if you do a bunch
of dimensional analysis

00:33:33.410 --> 00:33:37.700
examples related to entropy,
then they'll think, oh,

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.530
dimensional analysis is a way
of solving entropy problems.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:46.370
So here, the overlap
is too big.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:47.620
So what do you have to do?

00:33:50.801 --> 00:33:52.250
AUDIENCE: More examples.

00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:53.176
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:33:53.176 --> 00:33:53.640
AUDIENCE: More examples.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:54.350
PROFESSOR: More examples.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.840
And where should they
be in this space?

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.170
Yeah, way around, right?

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.830
So you should make an
example over here.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.170
So this example has very little
intersection with the

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:13.210
other example.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:17.120
So here, this one and this one
and this one, they all have

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.050
very little overlap.

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:20.400
So now the overlap among
all three is pretty

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:25.310
much just the idea.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:27.790
But think how different that is
from the way most courses

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:29.020
are designed.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.290
Most courses, the examples,
you'll do 18 problems with the

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.150
ideal gas law.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:36.469
You'll do 18 integration
by parts.

00:34:36.469 --> 00:34:38.750
You'll do 18 solutions
of first order

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.520
differential equations.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:45.360
You'll solve 18 ion
channel problems

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.830
with a Nernst equation.

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:50.909
All of those actually don't
teach you the fundamental idea

00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:52.199
to be able to transfer it.

00:34:52.199 --> 00:34:54.630
So that's another cause,
see, that the

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:56.570
applications are too narrow.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.960
So you have to choose
your applications

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.750
as widely as possible.

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:02.550
And this makes teaching very
hard, because it means you

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.416
can't really-- yes, question?

00:35:05.416 --> 00:35:08.797
AUDIENCE: So it can't just be
like also the structure

00:35:08.797 --> 00:35:12.015
involved with it. it's
defined as having a

00:35:12.015 --> 00:35:14.000
class and having problems.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.606
So obviously, do something
in written.

00:35:15.606 --> 00:35:17.410
But you never really
communicate that.

00:35:17.410 --> 00:35:20.608
And if you would have like
let's say in physics, you

00:35:20.608 --> 00:35:22.330
would have [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.298
And maybe you have an exam, an
oral exam where you basically

00:35:24.298 --> 00:35:28.234
can evaluate the students and
really can find out if the

00:35:28.234 --> 00:35:31.186
students understood
the main idea.

00:35:31.186 --> 00:35:34.630
And then he has to
be transferred,

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.106
transfer the skills.

00:35:36.106 --> 00:35:41.300
So I mean in terms of like
broadening the way of how you

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.380
question the students
will help basically

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.840
get the idea across.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.970
PROFESSOR: I think
that's right.

00:35:46.970 --> 00:35:50.100
So the suggestion was that
oral exams are actually--

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.530
in general, it's true, are a
much better way of evaluating

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.840
whether the student understands
or not.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:57.600
It's very disconcerting for the
students, because, I think

00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.890
I said this last time, basically
in an oral exam, as

00:35:59.890 --> 00:36:02.050
soon as the student understands
something, you ask

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.230
something else.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.090
So you're like, OK.

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:04.560
They know that.

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.550
Let me ask them about
something else.

00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:07.110
So the student feels like
they're never talk about

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:07.940
something they know.

00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:10.100
But that's the purpose of it.

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:12.710
So yeah, an oral exam,
like a PhD qualifying

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.460
exam, forces transfer.

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.550
That's what you're checking
for in the

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.980
PhD qualifying exam.

00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:19.360
So if you do things like that
in the undergraduate course,

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:24.280
that's setting a goal of
transfer, that this is one of

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:25.930
the goals of the course, that
you be able to use these

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.180
skills in new situations
I'm going to ask about.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.610
But of course, to be fair, you
have to give them practice in

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:31.580
doing that.

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:33.596
You can't just give them regular
problems and all of a

00:36:33.596 --> 00:36:35.560
sudden give them an oral exam
where you say now transfer it

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.120
to a new thing.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.490
They'll just hit a brick wall.

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.930
But it helps you in designing
the course.

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:44.600
So I'll put the backward design
diagram up again, to

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.010
show that process.

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:49.000
So here, you want to
choose from as

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.300
wide a set as possible.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.750
And generally, that's
not done.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:56.050
So I wanted to read a couple
of selections from the Eric

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:00.390
experiment about what
happens in class.

00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:02.550
So I know you had a
choice of reading.

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:06.780
So who chose the Eric
experiment?

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.020
I thought they were
all fascinating.

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.790
So if you remember,
there was a couple

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.290
quotes from Eric himself.

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:16.480
So for those who didn't read
it, Eric was a non-physics

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.020
student who took a summer
session physics course

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.940
freshman, physics course,
and recorded--

00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:23.180
I think he was a philosophy
major.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.910
And he recorded his impressions
of what it was

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.760
like to be in a physics class.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.975
So that's actually--

00:37:27.975 --> 00:37:30.370
you get quite a different view
of what a physics class should

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:32.890
be when someone from outside
comes, sort of like this

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:35.570
diagram all over again.

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:38.880
He said the class consisted
basically of problem solving

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.950
and not of any interesting or
inspiring exchange of ideas.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.810
The professor spent the first
15 minutes defining terms.

00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:46.800
And apparently that was all the
new information we were

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:48.570
going to get on kinematics.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.710
Then he spent 50 minutes doing
problems from Chapter 1.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:53.890
He was not particularly good at
explaining why he did what

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:56.590
he did to solve the problems,
nor did he have any real

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:58.905
patience for people who
wanted explanations.

00:37:58.905 --> 00:38:02.130
You know, the why, the what were
the ideas, why would you

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.440
do it this way rather than
that way, those weren't

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.730
generally part of the course.

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:08.050
So by not making them part of
the course, you're actually

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.270
pushing towards their
rote learning.

00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:15.480
And that doesn't mean that
there are not all these

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.260
interesting questions.

00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:18.445
So later on in this selection,
he says, well, actually, you

00:38:18.445 --> 00:38:20.500
know, I wonder about all the
names that physicists give.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:22.530
But there was no space to ask
those questions in class.

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:26.580
He says action/reaction, that's
Newton's third law,

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:29.000
that presupposes a cause and
effect relationship, which

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.250
implies duration.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:33.710
But in physics, actually
action-reaction happen

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:34.940
simultaneously.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.400
So those are the kind of the
questions that he's asking

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.990
himself, Eric, the
student, that get

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:40.180
away from rote learning.

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.320
But the structure of the
class doesn't encourage

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.460
anything like that.

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.050
And the only reason he has time
to think about that is

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:49.060
he's not actually trying to
just survive the class.

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.930
He's sort of going in as an
experimental student, whereas

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:53.670
the students who are just trying
to survive the class,

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:56.120
if any thoughts like that
occur to them, they

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:57.150
just say, forget it.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:38:59.850
No time to think about that. i
have to solve the 10 problems

00:38:59.850 --> 00:39:02.710
on the end of Chapter
3 right now.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:06.480
So those are the causes.

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.100
What do you do about it?

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.780
Well, there are several
principles of design.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.610
So last time I talked about two
organizational principles,

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:22.615
the signals and systems model
of how to teach a course.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.640
So this was the teaching
equation.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.555
So this is the output,
what students can do.

00:39:44.555 --> 00:39:46.240
So you choose that.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:55.680
You also have to understand
students', students' thinking.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:03.210
And then you figure out your
teaching given what Given you

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.380
want them to be able to do and
how students think, the

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:11.410
misconceptions, how people
learn, visual, by examples,

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:13.960
diagrams like that, how
should I teach?

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:17.360
So that gives you an overall
structure for course design.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.320
The other structure,
which is quite

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.930
similar, is backward design.

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:40.470
So backward design, you invert
the normal order.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:43.910
So the highest level in
backward design is--

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.070
that's the and over there.

00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:17.750
So this is a hierarchical
structure.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:20.870
Basically, you choose
your course goals.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:23.990
You find ways to make
them operational.

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:27.110
So in other words, how would
you measure, for example,

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:32.770
being able to solve Newton's
laws problems in designed

00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:35.220
bridges, for example, might
be one of your goals.

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:37.260
Well, you would actually give
them some bridges to design,

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:38.530
things like that.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.380
And then given that you want
them to be able to do that,

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.810
what do you do in class?

00:41:41.810 --> 00:41:44.290
So this was last time.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.220
That's this time.

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.360
And this is next time.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.470
And as I said before, I start
here, just because I find this

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.830
is at the right level,
balanced between

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:05.990
concrete and abstract.

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.290
So we did that last time.

00:42:07.290 --> 00:42:09.050
But now we're here.

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:11.170
How do you choose
course goals?

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.390
And that, the paper
by Middlebrook--

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.210
so who read Middlebrook's
paper?

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.900
A few people.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:18.130
OK.

00:42:18.130 --> 00:42:20.965
So if you haven't read it, I
didn't want to overload you

00:42:20.965 --> 00:42:23.360
with reading, but I think it's
also a brilliant paper.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.140
And I know Middlebrook because
he was my teacher at Caltech.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.080
And I took the course that he
describes in the paper.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.360
And he identified a fundamental
problem and a

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:34.840
fundamental solution to it.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.380
In other words, how do
you choose the goals?

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:40.840
And I myself have actually come
to pretty much the same

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.570
conclusion through years
of hard experience.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:49.960
So this is all to answer,
what do you do about it?

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.960
Which is, you choose course
goals such that the course

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.330
itself will produce transfer.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.020
So let me explain the problem
that Middlebrook identified

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:06.220
and what his solution is.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:12.300
So his particular class is an
analog circuit design class.

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:15.760
And generally, the way analog
circuit design is taught is

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.250
you have a circuit.

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:22.260
And you ask the students
to analyze it.

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:34.320
For example, you give them a
circuit that filters out high

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:40.110
frequency noise, for example,
in an audio recorder in a CD

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:42.010
recording studio.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:43.360
And you analyze it.

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.990
And you see that its
behavior does do--

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:47.990
what is its behavior?

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.330
OK.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:50.190
It throws away high
frequencies.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.480
OK.

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:53.150
So now that's the general
run of the mill.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:54.650
You'll just get tons and
tons and tons of

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:55.830
problems like that.

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.970
And you learn a wave of analysis
that allows you to go

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:59.910
from here to there.

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:03.840
But then what happens when
the student graduates?

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:05.180
What happens is what
Middlebrook calls

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.820
a fall off a cliff.

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:08.890
So either they go into graduate

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.670
school or into a company.

00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:13.740
But either way, what
happens is they're

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:16.060
actually given that.

00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:19.770
Somebody says, well, actually,
I need a circuit that doesn't

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:26.150
cost too much but is quite
exact and cuts off all

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.760
frequencies beyond 22 kilohertz
and doesn't mess up

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.810
the frequencies below
20 kilohertz.

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:31.810
This is actually
a real problem.

00:44:31.810 --> 00:44:34.700
That's how you need to
do that to record.

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.680
The people who developed the
CD standard had to make

00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:38.150
something like this.

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.360
So basically you're making a,
quote, "antialias" filter.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:41.550
So I want that.

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:45.550
Now here, the problem is that
the student has learned

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:48.430
methods of analysis that
cannot be inverted.

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.050
For example, one method of
analysis is you have a circuit

00:44:51.050 --> 00:44:53.060
and you just simulate
the thing.

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.320
You just feed it to your
computer, which does all the

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.830
analysis for you.

00:44:56.830 --> 00:45:01.790
An analogy for that is if
someone gives you a function

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:05.030
to graph, you can use your
graphing calculator to see

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:06.760
what the graph looks like.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.190
But suppose someone says, well,
I want a graph that

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:10.790
looks like this.

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.480
The graphing calculator can't
answer that question.

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.400
So they've learned methods
of analysis that are not

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.650
invertible.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:27.650
So they're actually useless,
because the real world problem

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:29.840
is exactly opposite of
the school problem.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:32.250
The school problem, the
circuit is the start.

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.305
In the real world, the
specification is the start.

00:45:40.850 --> 00:45:43.850
So to have any hope of going
from there to there--

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.300
this is a one-way arrow, it's
like a diet-- you need a

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:47.550
different method.

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.760
You need to learn invertible
methods of analysis.

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.760
So if you have invertible
methods of analysis, you can

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.265
go both ways.

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:14.020
And this problem I think is
central to many, many, many,

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:16.480
many courses, not just to this
particular analog circuit

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:17.620
design course.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:22.850
So then, what Middlebrook slowly
evolved to was not just

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:25.460
teaching invertible methods of
analysis, but he made those

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:27.710
the foreground of the course.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:33.060
As he described, "I found in
teaching this stuff for a long

00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.460
time, I've actually had to put
names and words to ideas for

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.030
the students to get
hold of them.

00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:42.340
This came about because for a
long time I taught by example.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:44.450
I used a lot of methods, saying
we're going to look

00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:46.070
into the properties of
a certain circuit.

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.500
And I would use some shortcut
method or trick that I thought

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.140
was a neater way to do it.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.170
And I just showed them this
without actually emphasizing

00:46:52.170 --> 00:46:53.240
the method.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.190
That was fine.

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:56.020
But when they did the homework
problems and exams, their

00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:59.420
minds just automatically reset
to the old way of doing it.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.610
So that didn't work very well.

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:02.640
And I finally realized I had
to give names to these

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.290
things."

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:05.750
And those are the names that
he introduces in the paper.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.950
So those names, some
of those are

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:10.340
specific to analog circuits.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:11.990
Some are general.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:16.030
But it's the giving of names
that is the central

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.260
[INAUDIBLE].

00:47:17.260 --> 00:47:20.820
So you give names to the big
ideas in the course.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:24.370
And you don't just use them in
passing, but you make them the

00:47:24.370 --> 00:47:27.700
focus of the course.

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:28.950
So let's see.

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:43.130
So in answer to what
should the course

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:44.860
goals be, roughly speaking--

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:12.290
OK.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:16.490
Questions about that, because
it's very different from how

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:17.740
it's normally done?

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:25.410
So if you look, for example, at
a biology course, it might

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:29.660
be organized by, say in cell
biology, organized by the

00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:35.250
organ to organelle, the little
system inside the cell.

00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:38.130
But those aren't necessarily
transferable to anything

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:40.720
except that particular
subject.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.050
A physics class might be
organized by a whole bunch of

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.320
kinematics problems and
dynamics problems.

00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:50.210
But a big organizational
principle that is implicit

00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:52.500
there but isn't said is that,
well, actually what we're

00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.560
doing is we're approximating
down to something simple

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:57.100
enough that we can do.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:58.550
That's an organizational
principle

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:00.470
that you can transfer.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.380
But that's never said.

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.150
It's just implicit.

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.990
If you look at Chapter 1,
the systems are simpler.

00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:06.520
And then Chapter 2,
they get harder.

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:07.982
Maybe they have two dimensions
in them.

00:49:07.982 --> 00:49:10.210
In Chapter 5, they have
two particles in them.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:13.110
In Chapter 7, they have
n particles in them.

00:49:13.110 --> 00:49:16.330
So it's this process of
successive complication.

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:19.110
And the beginning part of it,
where we simplified real-world

00:49:19.110 --> 00:49:22.110
things into just one particle
moving in one dimension at

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:25.150
constant acceleration, that was

00:49:25.150 --> 00:49:26.480
never told to the students.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.730
So the transferable principle
just went straight by them,

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:31.850
because we never made
it explicit.

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:35.140
So you have to, if you ever
want to have any hope of

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.520
teaching these ideas, you have
to make them explicit and give

00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:39.770
them names.

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.460
Giving things names is
absolutely essential to have

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.820
any chance of learning them.

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:48.180
And this was known in
all the old legends.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:50.500
The gods did not want the
mortals to have names for the

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:54.730
gods, because it would give
the mortals too much power

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:56.340
over the gods.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:00.550
So some gods were
He-who-has-no-name.

00:50:00.550 --> 00:50:03.780
And maybe only the high
priest knew the name.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.400
Well, you don't want to
be the high priest.

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:09.200
You want to share the names
with the students.

00:50:09.200 --> 00:50:12.260
And that involves a lot and a
lot and a lot of thinking.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.440
That's where most of the work
in course design goes, is

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:20.960
figuring out those main ideas,
those transferable goals and

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:23.180
ways of reasoning that students
can use no matter

00:50:23.180 --> 00:50:24.870
what they do.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:29.660
And then to teach them, you need
to have it from as wide a

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.370
set of examples as possible.

00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:33.850
So for example, to give you an
illustration, when I teach

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:38.505
dimensional analysis, which is
the idea, and I want them to

00:50:38.505 --> 00:50:41.130
be able to use it wherever,
the first example--

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:42.700
I forget whether it's the first
or second. i sort of

00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:43.840
flip it around.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:50.740
The first example is in
economics, because you can

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:53.540
identify a lot of bogus stuff
in economics, because it has

00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:54.740
the wrong dimensions.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:55.965
So I want them to
see it there.

00:50:55.965 --> 00:50:59.300
The second example is solid
geometry, volumes of

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.390
tetrahedrons and cones
and things.

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:05.520
And then we do sort of a more
standard physics one.

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.730
So I want them to see the broad
sweep of this idea so

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:10.430
that the idea comes clear.

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:16.510
So the thing to do is to
identify large ideas.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:19.150
So these are the--

00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:23.000
OK.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:29.040
So to practice, choose right now
a course in your own mind

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.020
that either you are interested
in teaching or teaching now or

00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:34.570
would like to teach.

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:37.830
And see if you can come up with
some big ideas for that

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:42.400
course, just to practice what
some big ideas are.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.430
And I will show you as an
example the large ideas for

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.350
my-- just to give you an
idea of what they are.

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:55.180
I'll show you the tree for my
approximation course just so

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:58.070
you can see what level these
ideas kind of live at.

00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:07.100
So the whole course is designed
around how do you

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:10.230
deal with complex problems and
how do you handle the fact

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:11.900
that the world is
really messy?

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:19.240
And I broke that down into
either you manage it or you

00:52:19.240 --> 00:52:20.490
throw it away.

00:52:23.770 --> 00:52:26.350
Those are still too high-level
to actually do anything with.

00:52:26.350 --> 00:52:28.860
But I wanted to organize
the big ideas as well.

00:52:28.860 --> 00:52:34.290
So you can manage it by divide
and conquer reasoning, so

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:36.210
subdividing into smaller
problems.

00:52:36.210 --> 00:52:37.460
Or you can make abstractions.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:42.870
Abstractions is basically the
process of giving names to

00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:46.190
things, which is what we're
talking about now.

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:49.580
To throw away complexity, you
can either do it losslessly--

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.420
so this is methods of reasoning
that find complexity

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.910
that isn't there but look like
it is there and get rid of it.

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:04.740
So symmetry is number one.

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:06.950
And examples of symmetry
reasoning are proportional

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:10.010
reasoning and dimensional
analysis.

00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:12.010
So those are all
lossless ways.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:13.490
They don't actually
cost you anything.

00:53:13.490 --> 00:53:15.730
If they work, they make your
life so much easier.

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:17.740
And you haven't thrown
any information away.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:21.090
Or you can make lossy
compression.

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:26.190
So you can do extreme cases,
look at only the simple cases

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:28.940
of things so you're throwing
out information.

00:53:28.940 --> 00:53:33.810
Or you can make spring models.

00:53:33.810 --> 00:53:36.152
So even though things aren't--
like chemical bonds, you can

00:53:36.152 --> 00:53:37.400
just say, well, they're
just like springs.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:40.070
So that's a very useful
but lossy way.

00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:44.590
Or the final one is
you can lump.

00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:47.640
So you can lump changing
processes into one.

00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:51.520
For example, a curve, you want
to find the area under the

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.870
curve, well, replace it
by one rectangle.

00:53:53.870 --> 00:53:56.920
So that general pattern--

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:00.110
those are what I've found are
the most useful ways of

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:01.340
dealing with complex problems.

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:08.430
So these are the big ideas
in that course.

00:54:08.430 --> 00:54:10.420
And the whole course is
organized that way.

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:14.460
And I show this tree once a week
usually, just so people

00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.710
know where they are.

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:21.530
So now, depending on the course,
what stuff you have in

00:54:21.530 --> 00:54:22.820
your big ideas will
be different.

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:25.940
But I just want to give you an
idea of what some large ideas,

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:27.740
some structuring
principles are.

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:30.420
And then the course itself is
actually organized Unit 1,

00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:33.010
Unit 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:54:33.010 --> 00:54:35.680
So what I've found is, just like
Middlebrook found, that

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.330
not only do you have to give
names to the things, but I

00:54:38.330 --> 00:54:40.530
found that I had to actually
organize the course around

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:43.370
them, rather than organizing
them around the topics that

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:46.530
they apply to, if I really
wanted the techniques, the

00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:48.960
ways of reasoning,
to transfer.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:49.270
OK.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:52.780
So questions about what these
large ideas, these reasoning

00:54:52.780 --> 00:54:53.820
principles, are?

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:55.400
What kind of things
to look for?

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:56.400
Yes.

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.900
AUDIENCE: What's the topic
of the course?

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.560
PROFESSOR: The course
is called The Art of

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.350
Approximation in Science
and Engineering.

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:04.700
So actually, it's carte blanche

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.970
to talk about anything.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:11.000
So that's why these are probably
higher-level objects

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.210
than in most courses which
will be narrower.

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:16.420
But even there, like for example
in physics, in the

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.120
Intro Physics, one of the
core ideas is successive

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:20.830
approximation.

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:22.420
And that's not brought
out normally.

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:23.780
But you could bring it out.

00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:25.290
You could say, look, we're
using successive

00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:26.370
approximation again.

00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:29.090
Or here's the structure of the
course, so that it's plain for

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:29.665
the student.

00:55:29.665 --> 00:55:31.830
Does that help?

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:32.230
OK.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:34.990
So pick that course
in your mind.

00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:36.510
And talk to your neighbor.

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:40.090
And see if you come up with,
say, two or three large ideas.

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:41.760
And now what we're going to do
is we're going to put them on

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.630
the board, the reason being that
you'll find that people's

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:48.520
big ideas and large ideas from
other courses you'll be able

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.880
to use in your course,
not every single

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.750
one, but many of them.

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:54.440
That's almost by definition what
makes something a large

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.370
idea, that it's not just
limited to that course.

00:55:56.370 --> 00:55:59.880
So it helps to see what
other people's are.

00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:05.230
So I'll make some space on the
board to draw those up.

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:11.260
So I'll give you a chance to
develop your list farther in

00:56:11.260 --> 00:56:12.790
the homework.

00:56:12.790 --> 00:56:15.250
Oh, I should say something about
the homework, which is

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:18.000
that you guys are all
grad students, or

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.250
almost all of you.

00:56:19.250 --> 00:56:21.160
You're all taking the
course for fun.

00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:23.880
It's kind of pointless of me to
police whether you're doing

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.150
stuff or not.

00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:29.310
But all the same, I will give
you an assignment to do--

00:56:29.310 --> 00:56:30.900
and I'll just trust that
you'll do it--

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:34.980
which is to work with each other
on making large ideas

00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:38.220
for a course and then figuring
out examples for those large

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.780
ideas, so basically a sketch
of a course design And the

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:45.250
reason to do this, starting now
and also later, is that

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:48.180
basically that is the hardest
work of course design.

00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:51.340
Once you've done that,
everything else sort of flows.

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.280
The syllabus writing, all
that stuff, just flows.

00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.420
But if you haven't done
this, you're just

00:56:56.420 --> 00:56:57.080
kind of spinning around.

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.590
And you don't actually know
what you're doing.

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.240
It's really hard to actually
figure out how you should

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:02.590
start and what you should do.

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:04.740
So, big ideas.

00:57:04.740 --> 00:57:06.045
Any big idea in any course?

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:11.180
AUDIENCE: Separation of scale.

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:11.490
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:14.930
Separation of scale, so that
behavior at one scale and

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:18.020
another scale, you can often
separate them and analyze them

00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:20.826
differently and without
interfering with each other.

00:57:20.826 --> 00:57:23.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:27.920
past problems and then
[INAUDIBLE].

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.350
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:29.570
Separation of scale.

00:57:29.570 --> 00:57:34.640
So for example, I've seen that
done in neurobiology.

00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:36.630
It's done in physics
all the time.

00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:42.840
So in neurobiology, the calcium
flux, the calcium

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:47.390
concentration changes slowly,
so you do the calcium

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:49.590
concentration separate from,
say, the sodium and the

00:57:49.590 --> 00:57:53.360
potassium, which is done with
the action potential spikes.

00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.690
So separation scales, very
important principle across

00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:57.280
many fields.

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.200
Yes?

00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:58.880
AUDIENCE: Equilibrium.

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.130
PROFESSOR: Equilibrium.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:05.660
Is that right?

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:07.950
So equilibrium, right away you
can see if you really want

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:11.440
students to understand the value
of equilibrium, you have

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:14.940
a whole set of examples
to use, to steal from.

00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.250
You can use chemistry,
physics, mechanical

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:19.680
engineering.

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.350
And they all have slightly
different senses to

00:58:22.350 --> 00:58:23.880
equilibrium, statistical
mechanics.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:26.580
But there's some core idea
that's the same.

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.910
And so it also is an argument
for team teaching, or actually

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:31.870
talking to colleagues from
different fields to steal

00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:34.540
examples from them.

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.550
Yes?

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:38.005
AUDIENCE: I don't know how
to describe this, but it

00:58:38.005 --> 00:58:41.933
describes a process which we all
do research, and that is

00:58:41.933 --> 00:58:43.897
how to deal with scientific
problems.

00:58:43.897 --> 00:58:45.147
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:49.790
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:58:49.790 --> 00:58:56.450
So identifying a scientific
question and how to start

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:57.185
studying it.

00:58:57.185 --> 00:58:57.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:57.490 --> 00:58:58.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.035
Identifying and studying.

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:15.205
Right.

00:59:15.205 --> 00:59:18.180
And there's many things that are
common across many fields.

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.990
And there's many things that are
different in each field.

00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:22.920
And you can actually have
a very fruitful--

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:25.230
I could imagine a really
fruitful interesting--

00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:26.760
you could almost teach a
whole class on this.

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:29.630
Actually, that sounds
kind of fun.

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:31.830
You could teach a history of
science class on scientific

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:33.980
questions that were identified,
how they were

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.130
studied, what principles
still are done today.

00:59:36.130 --> 00:59:39.470
You could have people read
papers from across many fields

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:42.400
and read the intro and see
how they would study that

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:45.200
question, see what questions
there are.

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:45.770
Yes.

00:59:45.770 --> 00:59:46.450
Sharon.

00:59:46.450 --> 00:59:46.840
AUDIENCE: Resonance.

00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:47.190
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:48.430
AUDIENCE: Resonance.

00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:49.680
PROFESSOR: Resonance.

00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:58.560
Right.

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.520
Resonance you can have
a field day with.

01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:01.720
It's in electric circuits.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.710
It's in mechanical systems,
the earth-moon system, the

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:07.940
tides are driven almost
on resonance by the

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:10.350
moon and the sun.

01:00:10.350 --> 01:00:11.440
Resonance is everywhere.

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.590
It's in mechanical systems.

01:00:12.590 --> 01:00:15.090
There's beautiful films
you can show of the

01:00:15.090 --> 01:00:17.710
Tacoma Narrows Bridge.

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:19.830
I think the London Millennium
Footbridge as

01:00:19.830 --> 01:00:22.740
well got hit by resonance.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:25.340
So resonance, another very
transferable idea.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:25.940
Yes?

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:29.230
AUDIENCE: How to develop
3D models.

01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.750
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:32.025
So how to build models.

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:37.760
Right.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.630
And that's something
that there are

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:41.660
general patterns to it.

01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.470
And some of it's specific
to a particular course.

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:44.450
But there are general
patterns.

01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:46.080
And that's something the
students can use no matter

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.930
what they do later.

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:49.610
Whenever you go to
a new field--

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:51.490
so there's a Nobel
Prize winner at

01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:53.390
Harvard, Walter Gilbert.

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:55.700
So he's worked in I think
chemistry, physics, and

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.410
biology, many different
fields.

01:00:57.410 --> 01:00:59.080
And he said, oh, yeah.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.980
Whenever you go to a new field,
there's only a few key

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:03.210
ideas in that new field.

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:05.350
And the hard work is figuring
out what those are.

01:01:05.350 --> 01:01:06.800
But that's what you
have to do.

01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:10.430
So that is one of the
transferable skills as well.

01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.940
Others?

01:01:10.940 --> 01:01:11.840
Yes.

01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:14.720
AUDIENCE: Problem solving
requires communication.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:15.100
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:16.350
So communication.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.160
Right.

01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:25.420
If you can't communicate, you
haven't solved the problem,

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.480
which reminds me of my Caltech
students, when I

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.430
had them keep a journal.

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:32.990
And then I told them I wanted
them to explain--

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.850
the journal they liked.

01:01:33.850 --> 01:01:35.150
But then I said, on the
homeworks, I want you to

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.590
explain your reasoning
so that it reads.

01:01:37.590 --> 01:01:40.460
It's not just hence and
thus and therefore.

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.250
And they said, well, why
we have to do that?

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:43.080
We're physics students.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.280
I said, well, later on, you're
going to have to communicate

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.640
your answers to someone.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.810
They said, oh, we'll just hire
someone who does that.

01:01:49.810 --> 01:01:52.550
So then I said to them, "well,
how are you going to explain

01:01:52.550 --> 01:01:54.470
it to that person?

01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:59.487
How will they know?" I said, "oh
you're going--" "oh, I'll

01:01:59.487 --> 01:02:01.470
explain it to them." I said,
"oh, so you are explaining

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:01.740
something?"

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:04.050
They said "oh, no." Somebody
said, "oh, well, actually that

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:06.510
person will understand it
already." So then I said to

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:10.550
them, "well, so that person
understands it already and can

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:11.480
communicate it.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:13.135
And you just understand it.

01:02:13.135 --> 01:02:15.740
Who are people going
to turn? "

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.840
So only then did they agree that
it was a good thing to

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.480
actually write problem sets
so they could communicate.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.360
So that's something you
can teach in any

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.780
field and across fields.

01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.150
You could look at scientific
writing.

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:27.090
You could look at writing
scientific papers.

01:02:27.090 --> 01:02:29.780
You can look at giving
presentations.

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:32.200
Doing it on problem sets so they
communicate, you can have

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.330
students exchange problem
sets with each other.

01:02:34.330 --> 01:02:36.430
If they can't understand the
other problem set, clearly it

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:38.960
wasn't communicated.

01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.100
Other transferable ideas?

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:40.530
Yes.

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:40.920
AUDIENCE: Coordinates.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.120
PROFESSOR: Coordinates.

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:42.550
Yes.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:49.650
So coordinates and--

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:52.250
it's also fun to make this
kind of list, because you

01:02:52.250 --> 01:02:54.540
start to see commonalities
and they start to

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:55.400
suggest other ones.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.630
So when you say coordinates,
I also think, oh, yeah.

01:02:57.630 --> 01:03:01.080
That's a general example
of representations.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.720
So there's different--

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:04.050
this is probably what you
meant is coordinate

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:06.150
representations, what you
were thinking of.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.800
But you can also think of the
general idea of choosing good

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.140
representations for solving
particular problems.

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:12.530
Like for some problems,
a symbolic

01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:13.880
representation may be right.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:17.020
And some, there's a pictorial
representation.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:19.610
You want to use in circuits,
the time domain

01:03:19.610 --> 01:03:21.550
representation, or the
frequency domain

01:03:21.550 --> 01:03:22.370
representation.

01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:25.160
So coordinates, I'll put dot,
dot, dot, to say that almost

01:03:25.160 --> 01:03:35.090
leads to the next one, which is
representation in general.

01:03:35.090 --> 01:03:35.480
Others?

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:35.910
Yes.

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:36.770
AUDIENCE: Symmetry.

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:37.340
PROFESSOR: Symmetry.

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:37.780
Yes.

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.250
Symmetry, incredibly powerful.

01:03:47.461 --> 01:03:47.960
Yes.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.520
Adrian, and then you're next.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.465
Yeah?

01:03:49.465 --> 01:03:53.350
AUDIENCE: Then you have
approximation [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:53.750
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:57.200
So linearization.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.920
And that is of course
also huge.

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.870
I mean, symmetry is used
in almost every field.

01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:03.630
Linearization, basically
you can't do

01:04:03.630 --> 01:04:04.770
anything that's nonlinear.

01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:06.540
So every field does
linearization.

01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:10.280
So that core idea would be
beautiful to convey that.

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.026
Yes?

01:04:11.026 --> 01:04:13.310
AUDIENCE: Error.

01:04:13.310 --> 01:04:15.440
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:15.950
Errors .

01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:17.060
How do you deal with errors?

01:04:17.060 --> 01:04:19.170
There are common principles,
probability theory,

01:04:19.170 --> 01:04:21.870
statistics, that deal with
errors in any field.

01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:22.530
What are those?

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:24.680
Well, that's what you want to
understand so you can move to

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.050
any other field.

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:28.700
I'll put a dot, dot here, so
symmetry, another one that's

01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:30.590
related to symmetry
is conservation.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.000
Noether's theorem is that
every conservation law

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.590
corresponds to a symmetry
and vice versa.

01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:41.310
I think I've stated
that correctly.

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:43.490
But they flow from each other.

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:47.830
So actually I do conservation
here as part of symmetry.

01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:51.100
So let me stop the list
right there, just to

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:53.590
say that right away--

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:55.645
so let me put the other one
which I talked about before,

01:04:55.645 --> 01:05:01.570
which is successive
approximation, that you don't

01:05:01.570 --> 01:05:03.750
want to solve a hard problem
all at once.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.240
It's sort of like divide
and conquer.

01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:07.700
But you want to try to solve it
approximately and then less

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.630
approximately, then less less
approximately, so you get

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:13.010
closer and closer, as
close as you need.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:16.470
That's a general principle of
engineering design as well.

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:19.940
So these, just to show you
that all of a sudden you

01:05:19.940 --> 01:05:21.980
thought of a whole bunch
of examples.

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:24.160
And probably you can use that
in any course you take.

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.160
So now you all have like 11.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.230
Right now I'm not saying
you have to use

01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:28.320
all 11 in your course.

01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.800
But you can start to restructure
courses around

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.860
those ideas and make them
explicit and choose which you

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.630
think are the most important in
your field in the ways of

01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:39.350
thinking and illustrate them
with things from your field

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:41.330
but nearby as well.

01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:45.260
So this evening I'll post
a reading for next week.

01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:48.040
And I'll post a short assignment
basically to

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:50.790
continue this line of thinking,
just to give you

01:05:50.790 --> 01:05:53.140
some more practice
in course design,

01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:54.290
fleshing it out farther.

01:05:54.290 --> 01:05:58.840
But what you've done is the key
step, the hardest step to

01:05:58.840 --> 01:05:59.710
course design.

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:03.420
So if you could fill out
the question sheet,

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:05.250
as always very helpful.

01:06:05.250 --> 01:06:07.840
And also there was a
question before.

01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.770
Could I make sure to list
on the website things I

01:06:10.770 --> 01:06:12.720
mentioned in class?

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.040
Yes.

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:13.790
I should do that.

01:06:13.790 --> 01:06:17.710
So if I could request people to,
if you have in your notes

01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:19.300
any of the books that I
mentioned in class but didn't

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:22.050
put on the website, if you could
email me those, I will

01:06:22.050 --> 01:06:24.070
put them on the website.

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:26.800
So as a sort of divide and
conquer approach, I'm sure

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.630
actually collectively you
have all of them.

01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:30.980
OK.

01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:35.440
So just when you're done, you
can put the sheets up here.

01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.510
And then outside of that door,
we'll have office hours as

01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:42.810
usual so that the next class
doesn't get delayed by us

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:44.060
being in here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
By the time that Watson and Crick
figured out the structure of DNA,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
you know, it was sort of obvious
that since the two strands were

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
complimentary you could see how it
replicated.  And they also could see

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that somehow the information must be
encoded in the sequence of letters

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
down the strands of the DNA.
But it wasn't obvious what the code

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
was and how it was arranged,
how it worked.  And in principle it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
was anything you could do with
four-letters.  And so I pointed out

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
the other day this was sort of a
four-letter alphabet.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I think it's useful to think of
it this way with A,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
G, C and T, and RNA as also being a
four-letter alphabet.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But proteins are actually a
20-letter alphabet because there are

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
20 different amino acids.
And so somehow, since one of the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.000
key things that the DNA had to do,
it somehow had to encode the

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
information for making the proteins.
And there was a lot of work on

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
protein biosynthesis at the time.
And it looked pretty complicated.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
People had found that RNA seemed to
be important.  Cells that were

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
making lots of protein had lots of
RNA in them.  And another thing they

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
noticed was that if you looked in
eukaryotic cells the DNA stayed in

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the nucleus.  The proteins,
most of them, were out in the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
cytoplasm.  And the evidence was
that they were made out in the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
cytoplasm.  So somehow the
information had to get out of the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
nucleus where the DNA was
and into the cytoplasm.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And biochemists were breaking cells
open and trying to make cellular

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
extracts that would synthesize
proteins.  And I think it's fair to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
say at the time that it looked
extremely complicated.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And so thinking about how DNA
encoded information and got

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
translated into proteins was a very
complex issue.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But then actually there was a very
interesting development that had a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
strong influence in Watson and Crick
and led to them,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Crick in particular,
getting a key insight into the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
nature of this coding problem.
There's a physicist,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
George Gamow, who some of you know.
He proposed the ìBig Bang Theoryî.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
A very strong theoretical physicist.
And he wrote a letter to Watson and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Crick.  He thought he'd figured out
the basis of the genetic code.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And his idea was you had these
sequences of A, G, C and Ts.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And so everywhere the two bases came
together there was sort of like a

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
little different shaped hole.
So his idea was the amino acids

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
would stick into these little holes.
And he had a theory showing that

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
you could encode the sequence of
proteins by having the side chains

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
in the amino acids stick into these
little holes along the DNA.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Now, there turned out to be a
number of problems with that.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It didn't take into account the
involvement of RNA,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
which there sort of was quite of bit
of evidence for.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And more importantly it didn't take
into account the structure of the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
side chains of the amino acids,
which you guys have been exposed to.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
But it had a very profound
influence on Watson and Crick.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
They read this letter.  They
immediately realized the idea was

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
wrong and went out and had a lunch
at a pub, decided again how they

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
actually thought there were 25 amino
acids, but they realized some of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
them were just sort of special ones
that were modified only in

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
particular proteins and there were
really 20 amino acids that were

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
found universally in nature
and amino acids.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And what they,
Crick in particular,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
realized was that maybe instead of
having to think about protein

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
synthesis through this very complex
set of extracts and mixtures a

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
biochemist would work on,
that he could think about it at a

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
purely theoretical level,
which basically is up at this kind

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
of level.  But if you have a
molecule that has four letters and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
it's going to be encoding proteins
how does it do it?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Can I work out sort of the basis or
a possible theory for how that could

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
happen without actually knowing all
of the biochemical details?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So Crick made a couple of
simplifying assumptions.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
One was that the DNA only
determined --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:56.000
-- the linear sequence of amino

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000
acids and protein.
That all this information about the

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
3-dimensional stuff came from the
properties of the linear sequence

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
once it was made.
And I think you hopefully have

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
enough understanding of hydrophobic
and other sorts of interactions that

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
would cause a linear sequence amino
acid to take a particular

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
confirmation.  And the other
assumption he made was that

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
it must be universal.
And it would be hard to see how life

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
could have started if there wasn't
some kind of code that was universal

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
between organisms.
And if you start from those kinds

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000
of considerations then what you can
see is you cannot just have a

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
one-to-one correspondence between a
letter in the nucleic acid alphabet

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and a letter down here.
If A stood for valine that would be

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
fine, but you could only have code
for four amino acids that way.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So if you had one-letter words in
DNA there are four possibilities.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And so it could only make four.  If
you had two two-letter words then

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000
you'd have 16 possibilities,
still not enough for all the amino

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
acids.  If you had a three-letter
word --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
-- then you could do 64,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and in principle that would be all
you'd need.  It doesn't rule out

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
there couldn't be five or six or
seven-letter words.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Or if you think about this as they
were thinking about it at the time,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
even if it were let's say a
three-letter word,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
is it a code where you have one word,
then the next word,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
then the next word?  Or could it be
an overlapping word?  And

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
what about punctuation?
And maybe another thing,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
you can see if it's AG, CT,
etc., there's a frame of reference

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
problem, because if I'm going to
read them in groups of three,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
if I start here I'll get one word,
but if I start one letter over the

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
next group of three won't be the
same.  So somehow there would have

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
to be a starting point.
And so these are the sort of

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
considerations that they had to take
into account.  And, in fact,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Watson, excuse me.
Francis Crick and another scientist

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Sydney Brenner and some other
scientists worked out a very elegant

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
genetic experiment that demonstrated
that it was a three-letter code.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And I don't have the time to go
into it in this course.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000
If you take a genetics course it's
a very beautiful experiment.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
The principle of the thing, which I
could show you rather easily,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
is if you're writing a thing where
you're reading in three-letter words,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
something like this.
The cat ran out and,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I don't know, ate the rat or
something like that.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And these were all just
continuously run together,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
not separated out, but I've put them
out here.  As you can see they're

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
three-letter words.
If you lost one letter then it

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
would change to sort of gibberish.
You'd get stuff that looked like

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000
this.
And if you put one in you'd have the

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
same problem, but if you were to
either take out three letters or put

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
in three letters then,
even though there'd be a little mess

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
in here somewhere,
say I took out two more of these,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000
what we would now have from then is
the rest of it would now

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
make sense again.
And they did this sort of experiment

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
genetically.  They managed to figure
out there were two kinds of

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
mutations they could get in a
particular way.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Some were putting in a letter.
Some were taking out a letter.  And

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
they didn't know at the time whether
there were adding or deleting,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but they could tell they were in the
opposite directions.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And then they found if they took
three of one class,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
like three that would delete a
letter and put them all together

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
then things would more or less work.
Or if they put three that stuck in

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
an extra letter then everything
would more or less work.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So there was a genetic proof of the
three-letter part of the code before

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
it was figured out exactly how the
code itself worked.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And so going from this sort of
theoretical insight into the code to

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:55.000
actually figuring out how proteins
were made there was still quite a

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000
lot of stuff that had to happen.
And one was the concept of

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000
messenger RNA.
As I said, there'd been quite a lot

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
of evidence that RNA was somehow
involved in protein synthesis

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
because cells that made a lot of
protein made a lot of RNA.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And it seemed to be in the right
sort of place in the cell for the

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
proteins to be made.
So the idea merged that RNA was

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
somehow a carrier of information
from the DNA to the cytoplasm.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So it could serve as a template for
making proteins.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:47.000
So the idea that the cell copied
the sequence of a portion --

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:56.000
-- of the DNA.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And we'd probably think of this as
a gene right now.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Into RNA.  And the RNA would go into
the cytoplasm.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
That's the part outside the nucleus.
And then it would serve

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:25.000
as a template --

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
-- for protein synthesis.
Because of this thought that if you

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
had a cell like this with a nucleus
and the DNA in here,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that if a piece of RNA were to go
out into the cytoplasm and have

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
those properties it would be
functioning more or less as a

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
messenger.  It would be carrying the
genetic information from inside the

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
nucleus out into the cytoplasm.
And so the term began to be used of

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
a messenger RNA.
And so over here I'll put an mRNA to

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
indicate that.
Now, one thing you can also see is

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:15.000
we've talked about the structure of
DNA and RNA.  And it's essentially

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the same with one.
This is the nucleotide,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
which is the fundamental building
block of DNA.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And if you recall,
in DNA there's a hydroxyl,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
excuse me, a hydrogen there,
but in RNA there is this extra

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
hydroxyl.  This is 1 prime,
2 prime, 3 prime, 4 prime, excuse me.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Let's just leave it like for the
moment, 1, 2, 3,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
4, 5.  And so the DNA,
as you heard, was deoxynucleic acid

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
because it's missing this.
But other than that the backbones

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:11.000
are similar and the letters are
almost the same.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The A, the G and the C are exactly
the same bases in DNA and RNA.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The only difference is with the T
and the uracil.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So this is thiamine which is found
in DNA.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And this is uracil --

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000
-- which is found in --

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
-- RNA.  So the base pairing is over
on this part of the molecule.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So whether or not you have a methyl
group doesn't really change the base

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
pairing.  And so this process of
copying information in DNA to

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
information that's in RNA was seen
as essentially the same kind of

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000
language, but it's just sort of like
taking somebody's word processor

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
file and writing out longhand.
You'd be transcribing the

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
information but it would be
essentially the same kind of

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
information in essentially the same
form.  So this is known

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.000
as transcription.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I'll take just one very brief thing.
Some of you may wonder why did

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
nature do it this way?
Why didn't it just use uracil in

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
DNA?  So as a very brief aside,
I think we understand pretty much

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.000
why it does it.
And that is cytidine has this

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000
structure.  So this is C which is
found in DNA but it undergoes,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000
all of your DNA is a chemical and
it's able to undergo spontaneous

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000
kinds of damage.
In fact, in every one of our human

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000
cells every day,
10,000 times in any given cell a

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:39.000
base falls off totally just leaving
the deoxyribose sitting there.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And the cells have to fix it up.
And we have DNA repair systems that

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
do that.  But another very common
kind of thing that happens is that

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000
this NH2 group deaminates.
And if you do that, if a C happens

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
to deaminate in DNA it
gives you a uracil.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And if that ever happens,
the cell is actually able to tell

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that something went wrong because
uracil is not supposed to be in DNA

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and there are repair systems that
constantly scan the DNA and take out

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
any uracils that are in there.
And the reason, if instead of using

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000
thiamine it used uracil then the
cell wouldn't know whether the

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
uracil got there because it was
supposed to be there as part of the

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
sequence or whether it had arisen by
deamination of a cytidine.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
It's a minor point but I think we do
have an understanding as to why

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
there's thiamine in DNA and uracil
in RNA.  This isn't such a worry in

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
RNA.  OK.  But anyway.
So there's still a really big

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
problem here, though,
that Watson and Crick and others

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.000
were grappling with.
And it has to do,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
as I say, with this fact that the
information up here is the first in

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
DNA and RNA.  It's written as a
sequence of letters,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
if you will, chemical letters,
but there are only four letters in

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
the DNA alphabet and essentially the
same four letters in

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
the RNA alphabet.
However, the protein language has

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
got a totally different alphabet so
it's somehow like sort of

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
translating now from English to
Japanese or something like that.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Some really fundamental change had
to happen because there was a real

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
conversion from one kind of language
to another.  And so this process is

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
known as translation,
as going from information that's

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
written using a four-letter nucleic
acid alphabet to information that's

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.000
written using a 20-letter
amino acid alphabet.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And Crick on purely theoretical
grounds figured,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000
well, if you're going from one
language to another what do you need?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
You need a translator?
And what's a translator?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
A translator is someone who speaks
both languages.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000
So his idea was that if there was --
I'm going to just separate out,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
let's say this is the messenger RNA.
And I, just for clarity here, have

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
spaced out the three-letter words so
we can see them.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
These would be three like G-A-C or
something like that in the RNA.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
That there would be some kind of
translator.  And his idea was that

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
it would be something that had a
particular amino acid at one end and

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.000
it had the complimentary nucleotides
at the other end.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
So it could, if you will,
read the genetic code that was

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:11.000
written in the RNA using the nucleic
acid alphabet,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000
but it would also be speaking the
amino acid language.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Got the idea?  So the idea was that
this would be,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.000
they used the words adaptor or a
translator.  So that was on

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
basically theoretical grounds.
If you had to go from a four-letter

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
language to a 20-letter language you
needed some kind of translator or

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
adapter.  Now,
at that same time that these

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
considerations were going on,
biochemists began to find a class of

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:54.000
small RNAs --

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:02.000
-- that had an amino acid --

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000
-- attached.  And so there were
entities that had just the sort of

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
properties that Crick had envisioned
you'd need from theoretical

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000
considerations.
These were given the name transfer

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
RNAs or tRNAs as they're usually
referred to now.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000
And I've told you that RNA has,
since it's got nucleic acid bases,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
if you have a single strand of
either an RNA or a DNA and you don't

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:42.000
have a complimentary double-strand,
then if there are complimentary

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
sequences they can come together and
pair just the same way that

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
complimentary sequences can come
together in DNA.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And in the case of tRNAs,
once the sequence of these was

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
determined, oops.
There we go.  They folded up into a

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
clover leaf shape.
And the amino acid is attached up

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
at the 3 prime end of the chain up
here in what's known as the acceptor

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
part of the molecule.
And so that corresponds to this

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
part up here.  And here is what's
known as the anticodon.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Each of these three-letter words --

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000
-- in nucleic acid language is
called codon.  And so something that

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
had a complimentary sequence to a
codon was called an anticodon.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:05.000
So if G-G-G is the codon then C-C-C
would be the anticodon.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Now, this is just a schematic,
as you can see.  It shows where the

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
hydrogen bonds are that form this
stuff.  When the crystal structures

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:19.000
were done, the first crystal
structure of tRNA was actually done

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000
by Alex Rich.  He's in the Biology
Department at MIT.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And he was in this picture I showed
you talking to Matt Meselson.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
And although we cannot see this
terribly well,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
maybe you could hit the lights here,
the crystal structure showed that

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
the molecule didn't look like a
clover leaf as in there.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
It had more this shape.  And I'll
show you this more clearly in this

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
picture.  I showed you this little
part of the thing when I was showing

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
you how an RNA could form.
For example, if you copy the gene

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
encoding a tRNA and,
for example, the sequence here in

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
green is complimentary to the
sequence here,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
or the sequence here in sort of blue
or purple was complimentary

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
to the sequence here.
That what can happen then,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
if you allow a single strand RNA
like this to fold up,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
thermodynamically it will then go to
the lower energy state which

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
involves being able to make these
hydrogen bonds.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And I think you can sort of see the
clover leaf.  Here's one of the

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
leaves.  The other is down here and
the others.  It's a little

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
bit distorted here.
And the reason is,

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
because I'm going to continue now to
show you how this structure,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
once you get to the clover leaf,
then it folds up to make other kinds

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
of interactions and it takes that
shape with the tRNA going on at this

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
end and the anticodon being down
here.  And what's happening now is

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
they've morphed on the van der Waals
surfaces so you can see what this

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
would look like,
3-dimensional shape.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
The amino acid would be attached at
that end and there is the anticodon

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
that we'd be able to recognize,
the codon in the RNA.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000
I mean the physical reality is
pretty close to this simple little

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:18.000
depiction here.
OK.  So once this basic paradigm

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000
had been straightened out that gave
rise to this idea then,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000
putting it all together,
that the information in DNA,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000
that a portion of it would be copied
into RNA and that would go out into

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000
the cytoplasm.
And then in the cytoplasm these

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
translators, the tRNAs would be able
to decode, read the nucleic acid

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
information and use that to
determine the linear order of amino

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.000
acids in a protein.
Crick, when he came up with this,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
gave this the term ìthe central
dogmaî.  And people still use this

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
term to apply this idea of
information flow going from DNA to

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
RNA in protein.
And it's still used to this day.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:23.000
There's actually sort of a little
twist to that,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
because at the time that Crick
proposed the term he actually

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000
thought that the word dogma meant
ìan idea for which there is not

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
reasonable evidenceî.
But he was sort of amused years

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
later to realize that a more
reasonable definition of dogma is it

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
is something that a true believer
cannot doubt.  So he kind of

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
accidentally made an insertion that
he was right, but fortunately he was

00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:03.000
right.  Now --

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
-- the next big job,
though, in working this out was to

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:14.000
crack the code.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:19.000
And it's fine to know that it's a
3-letter code and it's fine to know

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.000
it goes into RNA and then the tRNAs
translate it, but if you cannot

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
crack the code then you have no idea
what any of the information means.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
It was sort of like before the
Rosetta Stone they could look at the

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
hieroglyphics in the Egyptian tombs
and they could see that it was a lot

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
of information and there were
symbols and so on,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000
but they didn't know what it meant
until finally they got something

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
that allowed them to relate it to a
language they did know and they were

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
able to work out the principles.
So somehow scientists had then to

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.000
crack the code.
And there were two scientists who

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
played a really big role.
One was Marshall Nirenberg who was

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.000
at NIH and is,
in fact, still at NIH.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
And the other was a scientist who's
on the same floor as me at MIT,

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Gobin Khorana.  And they used two
different approaches,

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000
but between these two approaches the
genetic code was cracked.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000
And what Nirenberg did was to take
a protein synthesizing --

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:42.000
-- extract that he knew needed RNA

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
in order to work.
So that wasn't a surprise at this

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
point because people were thinking
the RNA would be the message.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
And at that point the ability to
make synthesized nucleic acids was

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
quite limited compared
to what we do now.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:08.000
And so there were different ways of
making them.  Sometimes you could do

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
it enzymaticly.
But what Nirenberg,

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
for example, was able to make was
poly-U.  So this was an RNA that was

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:23.000
just UUUUUUU.  And then what he did
was he set up 20 reactions,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
and in every reaction he put some of
this extract, he put poly-U and he

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.000
put 19 of the amino acids
that were unlabeled.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
And then only one amino acid that
had radiolabel in it.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So he ran these 20 reactions and
waited to see in any of these did he

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
get protein made that would have
been coded by the poly-U.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000
And what he ended up with was
polyphenylalanine.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Which you may recall when we were

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000
talking about structures of amino
acids, there's the basic backbone.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And the polyphenylalanine is the
one that has, if you will,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:31.000
a benzene ring hanging off the end.
And so what that meant was that UUU

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:39.000
must code for a fee
or phenylalanine.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000
And if it's UUU in the RNA that must
mean that the DNA that encodes this

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000
must have that sequence AAA and TTT.
And you can see that one of the two

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000
strands of the DNA,
since T base pairs the same as

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000
uridine, but one of the strands in
the DNA is going to have the same

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000
sequence as one of the
strands in the RNA.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000
Now, I'll just tell you one brief
little anecdote.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
I heard Marshall Nirenberg at this
meeting they had to celebrate the

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
50th anniversary of the discovery of
DNA.  And he posed something that

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000
I'd never thought about in my years
of teaching this but might occur to

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
you guys if we put it
on a problem set.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
You all know something that benzene
is nothing but sort of these,

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
this as I call it, we even referred
to it as a benzene ring,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
which is a very organic kind of
solvent.  So if we put a problem set,

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
if you've made polyphenylalanine
would you expect this to be soluble

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
in water?  Well,
this is very, very hydrophobic,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
very, very water-hating.  And your
answer would be correct.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
If you said no, I wouldn't expect
polyphenylalanine to be

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
soluble in water.
In fact, if it were in a protein

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
you'd expect it to probably be in
the core where all the hydrophobic

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
interactions, the water-hating parts
would go.  So Marshall Nirenberg

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
said in his talk,
well, he had shown that he had

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
radioactive phenylalanine,
and he still had to prove chemically

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000
that he had polyphenylalanine.
But he wasn't much of a biochemist

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
so he walked down to the lab just
below NIH and walked in the door and

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000
saw the first person he saw and said
how do you solubilize

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000
polyphenylalanine?
Just to make sure I got this right.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
And the guy said, oh, you just take
33% hydrobromic acid and glacial

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
acidic acid and it works.
So he went back upstairs and

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
dissolved it.  It turned out it
dissolved in that.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
And he went on and characterized it.
And he said it didn't occur to him

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
or he didn't learn until about 15 or
20 years later that he just walked

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
up to the only person in the world
who knew how to solubilize

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
polyphenylalanine.
By total coincidence this guy who

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
had talked to had been working away
trying to figure out a way and had

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
come up with this odd mix of
hydrobromic acid and glacial acidic.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
And he just said of all the places
in the world, he walked up to the

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
one person who knew and got the
answer.  So the other part of the

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
story then involves Gobin Khorana
who I mentioned when I was telling

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
you initially about the Nobel
Laureates at MIT.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
And Gobin is a brilliant organic
chemist.  He synthesized DNA.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000
You know, it was a point where a
whole issue of a journal came out

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
and there was nothing but his labs
work and synthesizing DNA.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Well, he was good at nucleic acids.
And one of the strategies that they

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
could use chemically was they would
make something like a dye nucleotide

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
like CA.  And then they were able to
polymerize that to make a piece of

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000
RNA.  So they could make an RNA that
had the sequence CA, CA,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
CA, CA and so on.
And what you can see from that is

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
that there are two different codons
in that.  One is CAC and the other

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000
is ACA.  And the reason he made was
he was synthesizing it by

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
polymerizing nucleotides.
So in these same kinds of

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
experiments I was describing before,
what they found this synthesized was

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000
alternating histidine
and threonine.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
And you cannot tell from that
experiment alone.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
One of those must be histidine and
one of them must be threonine,

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:49.000
but you cannot tell from that
experiment so more experiments were

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
needed.  And what was learned from
that experiment in that case was

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000
that CAC corresponded to histidine
and ACA corresponded to threonine.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
So these kind of experiments were
then put together to give what's

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.000
known as the genetic code which is
the three-letter words encoded in

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000
DNA that encode the sequence amino
acids and proteins.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000
And it's usually displayed as a
table and you read it in this way.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
That this thing over here is the
first base in the codon,

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.000
across the top is the second base in
the codon, and down over here is the

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
third base.  So if we go to C as the
first, say the one for histidine we

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
were just showing you.
C is the first letter.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
A is the second letter,
so this is the box that we're going

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000
to be looking at.
And if C is the third letter we can

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
see it encoded histidine or AC come
back to A.  Then the A is certainly

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
threonine.  But you can also see
something else here.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
And that is because there were 64
possibilities with this three-letter

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
word the code is what's
known as degenerate.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
That is there are more words in the
genetic code than are needed to

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
specify the number of amino acids
that have to be coded.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000
So I just want to make a couple of
points about this.  So

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:30.000
the genetic code --

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
It's degenerate.
There are 61 codons that correspond

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:42.000
to an amino acid.
And that means that some,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
and I think threonine is a good
example, there's more than one word

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:54.000
in the genetic code that means
threonine.  There were tree codons

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:00.000
for which there was no corresponding
amino acid.  And those mean stop.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
And that would make sense because if
you're reading down a nucleic acid

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:11.000
piece of RNA, at some point you'd
have to end the protein.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
And so there are actually three
that are used for that purpose.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:22.000
And although there's some small
variation on this in nature there's

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.000
usually one amino acid that's used
for starting a protein,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
and that's methionine.
And it's AUG right there.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Now, some of this stuff probably
sounds like it's been around forever,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000
and that's certainly true of some of
the stuff you hear in your chemistry,

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
math and physics courses.
I just want to drive you home.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
When I was an undergrad Watson's
first book called the molecule

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
biology of the gene had come out,
so when I was your age, and I

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
realize that I look ancient but,
you know, at least I'm still here.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
When I was an undergrad I had
Watson's book.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
This was the genetic code that was
in the code, the genetic code as of

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
May 1965.  And you'll notice there
are gaps in here.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
And all the things that are
underlined were things for which

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000
there was a tentative assignment.
So although you may take this and

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000
think that it's been knowledge
that's been around forever,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
it wasn't even complete in the
textbook when I was

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
an undergrad.  OK.
So one of the things then that's

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000
important to think about the nucleic
acid stuff, this is the basis of how

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.000
proteins are encoded in the DNA.
But everything else has to be there,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.000
too.  And the genetic code,
that's what we've been talking about,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:01.000
is universal.  But there
are other languages --

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:09.000
-- written in the DNA that are not

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.000
universal.  And one of them was that
little example I gave you with an

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
origin of replication.
E. coli only starts DNA replication

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
at one very particular point in its
chromosome, so it is a particular

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000
sequence of DNA.
It's actually about 250 nucleotides

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
long.  So you could think of that as
a language.  It's like starting a

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:45.000
chromosome replication language.
It's only got one word in it, and

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
the word is 250 nucleotides long.
Another place that's very important,

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:57.000
and that is if you're going to make
an RNA copy, if you're going to do

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
transcription of a piece of DNA --
And I'll call this the coding

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.000
sequence.  This would be the
sequence of three-letter words that

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:15.000
we'd specify the amino acid of the
protein.  If you were going to make

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:21.000
an RNA copy of that,
you would have to somewhere have

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
something here that's a sequence up
here that means start

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:33.000
transcription.
And one at the end,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.000
some other sequence of letters in
the nucleic acid that would mean

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
stop transcription.
This is given the technical term

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
that's referred to as a promoter.
The stop one is referred to as a

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:58.000
terminator.  And these,
we'll say more about this.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Because the beauties of having this
system of making an RNA copy is it

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
provides a beautiful point of
regulation.  Because the cell can

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
determine whether or not it's going
to make a particular protein by

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
whether or not it chooses to make
the protein or not.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And so having this RNA intermediate
and being able to control

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:27.000
transcription is a really important
part of the whole regulation that

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:33.000
makes life possible.
The transcription is carried out by

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.000
an enzyme that's known as RNA
polymerase.  And let me make one

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:47.000
more point.  These promoters and
terminators are not universal.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000
So when we talk about recombinant
DNA a little bit in the course,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:01.000
if I take a mouse gene and I put it
in E. coli.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Even though the genetic code is the
same, we might have all the same

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
sequence of amino acids specified,
you won't get the RNA made because

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
the sequences that say start
transcription and stop transcription

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
are different between a mouse and a
bacterium even though the genetic

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
code is the same.
So you can kind of see from first

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000
principles.  If you're doing
recombinant DNA and you wanted to

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:29.000
express the mouse protein in E.
coli, you would have to fiddle

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
around with the sequences up here
and the sequences down there,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:39.000
the parts that are not universal.
You guys with me?

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:47.000
OK.  So what does an RNA polymerase
do?  It recognizes this sequence,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:55.000
and then it teases the strands apart
to make a little bubble like this.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:03.000
So let's say ATAGCTA.  So the other
strand then would be TATCGTA.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:08.000
And then RNA polymerase,
unlike a DNA polymerase, can begin a

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:13.000
chain de novo.
Remember an important thing about

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
DNA polymerases was they had to have
a primer terminus to get started.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.000
That was they had to use the
Okazaki fragments.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000
So this is DNA.  This would be 5
prime, 3 prime,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:34.000
3 prime and 5 prime.
And what an RNA polymerase can do,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.000
it uses DATP, DGTP, DCTP and DUTP.
It uses triphosphates,

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
excuse me.  Get rid of these.
Excuse me.  My mistake.  No deoxies

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000
here.  Of course this is RNA.
It uses ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP as

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
the substrates.
So it uses triphosphates just the

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
same way DNA polymerases do.
And then it's able to start a chain

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:01.000
de novo.
And it synthesizes the RNA in a 5

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:08.000
prime to 3 prime direction,
the same direction that a strand of

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
DNA is made by DNA polymerase.
So it would copy here.  And so it

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:21.000
would put in an A opposite a T.
And then because it's RNA it will

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:28.000
put in a U opposite an A,
and then an AGCAU and so on.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:35.000
So this right here is the beginning
of the RNA that's being synthesized

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000
by the RNA polymerase.
This strand is known as the

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
transcribed strand.
And by default then that one is the

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
non-transcribed strand.
And what you can see by doing this,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:56.000
it's making an RNA the same
sequences up here,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
except that everywhere there's a T
there's now a U in the DNA.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
So the final thing then is how this
information gets all put together to

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000
make proteins.
And protein synthesis is done by an

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:21.000
amazing machine known as the
ribosome.  It's made up of some

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:30.000
special large RNAs --

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:36.000
-- called rRNAs,
some proteins as well.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:43.000
These make up the ribosome.
And then it needs a mRNA and then

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
it needs the various tRNAs,
each of which carries an amino acid

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:56.000
that's appropriate to its anticodon.
And in a very briefly sort of way

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000
this is --
And you can see this in your

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000
textbook, what the ribosome does is
it takes, let's consider this is the

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000
mRNA.  I'm just going to take three
codons here.  And this mRNA treads

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
into the ribosome.
And I'll sort of show it's able to

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000
recognize the first codon and the
second codon.  Remember,

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000
of course, there's no spacing like
this in the RNA.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
And then in the context of this
large factory it's able to find the

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
tRNA that has amino acid one and the
anticodon that would correspond to

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
this.  The tRNA that has the next
amino acid attached and its

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
anticodon.  So you can see what's
happened.  It's been able to order

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
the first amino acid encoded by that
codon and put it physically right

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
next to the next amino acid that's
coded here.  And then

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:16.000
it catalyzes --

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
-- the formation of a peptide bond.
And what happens when that does is

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
the way this amino acid is joined to
the tRNA there's energy

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:31.000
stored in that bond.
And so thermodynamically that allows

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:37.000
this bond formation to go.
And now you end up essentially with

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:43.000
this.  And what happens now is
everything clicks over one.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000
So you could think of it as this
whole RNA shifts over one so the one

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000
that used to be here is now sticking
outside.  Here's part

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:01.000
of the ribosome.
Here's the next codon.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
What we have here is the tRNA
that's got amino acid two joined to

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
amino acid one.
The next codon specifies the next

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
amino acid which is three.
And the process is then able to go

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
on like that.  Now,
the structure of the ribosome,

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
the crystal structure of the
ribosome was just finished.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
And I guess we've got as many
lights out as we can do right now.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:33.000
It's absolutely remarkable.
It's mostly RNA.  The gray stuff

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:37.000
and the blue stuff are two huge RNAs
that are all folded up in

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
3-dimensional space.
And these things that are sort of

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000
stuck on the outside,
these purple things here or the dark

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000
blue things here that sort of look
like cherries stuck on the outside

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:53.000
of a cake, those are proteins.
So most of this is RNA, big balls

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:58.000
of RNA with proteins kind of
decorating the outside.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000
The mRNA is a green thing that
snakes through.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
There's the mRNA.
See it snaking through?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
And maybe you can recognize in the
middle this tRNA.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
There's an orange one and a yellow
one.  Those correspond to the two

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.000
tRNAs I depicted here.
And I'm just going to see if I can

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000
stop this.  There's a viewpoint I'd
like you to see when it comes around

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
again here in just a second.
I'll see if I can catch it there.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Right there.  Here's one of the
tRNAs in yellow.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
And its end is right there.
And there's the other tRNA.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000
And its end is right there.  So
this corresponds to the point at

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
which there's going to be an amino
acid formed.  And something is going

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
to catalyze the formation of that
bond.  Well, the next picture sort

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:51.000
of shows what happens if you pull
that apart.  And what you'll see is

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
that here's the end of one end of
the tRNA, there's the other end,

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.000
and there's nothing near it except
for RNA.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:05.000
So RNA is actually catalyzing the
formation of the peptide bond.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Another way to say that would be
that the ribosome,

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
which is the protein synthesizing
factory, is a ribozyme.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Remember I said most of the
chemical reactions that need

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:27.000
catalysts are carried out by
proteins but there are a few that

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:33.000
are carried out by RNA where
RNA is the catalyst?

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
And remarkably the formation of the
bond, which is at the heart of

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
proteins which are so important for
all life, is catalyzed by protein.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
If you look at what makes proteins,
what do you see?  You see huge balls

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
of RNA, a mRNA threading through two
tRNAs, and the enzyme activity or

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:59.000
the catalytic activity is encoded by
the RNA as well.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.000
As I said, people think possibly
there was an RNA world that preceded

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:08.000
our present-day world with DNA,
RNA and protein.  And who knows?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
But this sort of look at a ribosome
could at least make you see that

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000
that's a plausible explanation that
RNA might have been running the show

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
for a while before anything else got
involved.  Anyway, we'll

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
see you on Friday then.

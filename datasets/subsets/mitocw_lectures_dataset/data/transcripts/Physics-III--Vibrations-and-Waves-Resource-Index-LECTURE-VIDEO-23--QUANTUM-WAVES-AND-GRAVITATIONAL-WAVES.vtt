00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.040
YEN-JIE LEE: So what are
we going to do today?

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.990
So today, we're going to
continue the discussion,

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.080
based on what we have learned
from the diffraction and also

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.530
other interesting phenomena.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.660
And we are going
to make connections

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.030
to quantum mechanics
and discuss in greater

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.730
detail about this connection.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.550
And also, if time
allows, we are going

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:58.650
to cover information about
gravitational waves as well.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.750
So last time, we have
discussed diffraction pattern

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.790
coming from a laser beam.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.540
And we discussed
about resolution.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.940
And you can see that this is the
graph we see, last time already

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.190
in the lecture.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.860
Basically, all the
point light source

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.300
coming through a single slit is
going to be doing interference

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.540
to each other.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.530
So basically, you see
interesting pattern,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.060
which you have a central peak.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.780
And the total constructing
for interference

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.680
happens at the
center of the screen.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.550
And at some point,
you have a deep--

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.330
which is actually where total
destructive interference

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.450
actually happened.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.570
And we were able to understand
this with mathematics,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.490
which we learned in 18.03.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.550
Another interesting
result we find

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.780
is that, if we shoot a
laser beam to the moon--

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.290
by now, you should be able to
conclude that it's not going

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.650
to be a point on the moon.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.140
Instead, it's going to be a spot
as large as the whole Missouri

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.460
state.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.620
So that's actually
another interesting result

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.880
we found from that
discussion last time.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.080
And finally, we are
able to put together

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.320
all the things we have learned
from the last few lectures.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.200
Basically, you can
have, at the same time,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.910
the effect of multi-slit
interference and also

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.900
the effect of a single
slit diffraction--

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.760
all then put together.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.960
Then you have this complicated
but also beautiful pattern,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.510
which you will be able
to observe on the screen.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.040
And basically, the point is
that you are going to have,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.670
for example, in this case,
five-slit interference pattern.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.110
But that is actually modulated.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.660
The intensity is
modulated by the pattern

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.280
from a single-slit diffraction.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.650
OK, so that is
actually what we have

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.070
learned from the last lecture.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:25.370
Coming back to the original
question, why do we study 8.03?

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.890
The reason is that we
would like to understand--

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.250
we would like to hear
from that universe.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.800
So we cannot even
recognize the universe,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.090
without using waves
and vibrations.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.460
So that's the course in which
we have been doing here.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.010
And we have seen
waves of matter.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.920
So for example, here, we have
this water wave generator.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.450
You can see water waves.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.120
We have this Bell Lab machine.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.320
Because you can see the
coupled oscillator--

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.540
a multiple coupled oscillator.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.090
And they are doing
their job together

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.190
to form beautiful waves.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.050
And you can see those
beautiful results from there.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.980
Last time and also including
the last few lectures,

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.120
we have been using
this laser to produce

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.110
interesting interference
patterns and the diffraction

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.910
pattern.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.720
So that's the second kind
of wave, which we encounter.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.600
The first kind is
the waves of matters.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.660
The second kind
is waves of what?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.930
Waves of vector fields.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.570
It's not matter anymore.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.830
Because this field,
this oscillation field,

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.630
can also travel through vacuum.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.600
So that is actually
the second kind

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.660
of wave, which we
should learn for 8.03.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:05.090
They provide a pretty
adequate description

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.270
of the nature, description
of the phenomenon, which

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.890
we can actually measure, and
see from the experiment we

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.120
went over.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.640
So what I would like to
say in the lecture today

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:25.310
is that there are two kinds
of completely different waves,

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.750
which we haven't talked about.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.450
The first one is the
probability density wave,

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.230
which I will cover
that in a few moments.

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.010
The second one is
gravitational waves.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.940
This is actually a
space-time distortion

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.830
coming from the motion
of massive objects.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.490
And we would like to
see what we can also

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.100
learn from there, using the
existing knowledge of which we

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.530
have learned from matter waves
and the vector-field waves.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.970
And that they are, actually,
pretty similar to each other

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.210
if you look at their behavior.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.220
So the first thing which I
would like to discuss is light.

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.260
So far, what is light?

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.630
Light is like
electromagnetic waves.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:22.530
So that is actually
what we have learned

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.530
so far from 8.02 and 8.03.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.210
So they are like waves.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.670
They are waves, all right.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:34.290
On the other hand,
in the 20th century,

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:38.050
there are many, many
crises going on.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.260
So the first thing
which is happening

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.900
is photoelectric effect.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:48.270
So this experimental
result was actually

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.290
first discovered by Hertz.

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:57.390
So he found that, if you
want to kick one electron out

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:01.960
of some material or
some charged material,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:08.160
it is easier if you use a
high-frequency light compared

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.470
to low-frequency light.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:11.430
So that's the issue--

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.840
really strange.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.880
Because based on waves and
also the intensity formula--

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.270
while we really
care, intensity is

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:25.580
proportional to the square of
the electric field amplitude.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.110
So that's actually
what we learned

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:30.070
from the previous lectures.

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.100
But what Hertz was saying
is that the frequency also

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.300
matters.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:40.710
OK, so that's really
a bit strange.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.780
And Einstein actually
came in and explained

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.120
this photoelectric effect.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.510
So what we found
is that this effect

00:07:51.510 --> 00:08:01.950
can be explained by viewing
the light of small quantas.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:07.780
And light is actually
not like waves any more,

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.950
but like quantas--

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.540
the small quantas--
discrete ones--

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:18.470
with energy proportional
to the frequency.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.020
All right?

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:25.380
And basically, the energy
of those little quanta--

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.440
or we now call them photons--

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:35.370
is actually equal to h,
which is some constant--

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:41.100
relate the frequency and
the energy of the quanta.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.570
And with this
explanation, the view

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:50.250
is that the photons
are like particles.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:53.940
And therefore, he can
actually explain that, OK,

00:08:53.940 --> 00:09:02.530
if I measure the kinetic energy,
the maxima kinetic energy

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:09.900
of the electrons,
which are kicked out

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:14.820
from this photoelectric
effect experiment.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.255
I call it K-max.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:23.230
What you are going to get
is a formula like this.

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:26.850
The maxima kinetic
energy of electrons

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:34.120
will be equal to h
bar mu minus phi.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.110
Phi is actually some
kind of threshold,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.450
which you need
or, say, some kind

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:42.420
of energy, which you need
to overcome to kick one

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.070
electron out of the material.

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:52.860
So you can see from here that,
if the frequency of the light

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.660
is too low, then
this will never work.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.460
Because the maximum kinetic
energy will be below 0.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.170
Therefore, you cannot
kick out a electron.

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:12.950
But if the frequency is high,
as shown by Hertz experiment,

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:13.982
it is possible.

00:10:13.982 --> 00:10:20.300
And also, you can create
energetic electron,

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.240
have them kicked
out of the material.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.730
And this is actually
verified by experiment.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.990
And that's essentially
why Einstein should

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.860
get the Nobel Prize in 1921.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.260
So let me tell you
what the feeling here--

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.340
the feeling here is that, now,
things are really becoming

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:43.570
more and more interesting.

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:46.330
Because first of
all, we see really

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:51.310
well that the electromagnetic
wave describes

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.240
the behavior of the light.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.270
We see diffraction.

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.190
We see interference.

00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.910
All those things
can be explained

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:02.380
by the beautiful mathematics,
which we have been employing

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:04.270
to explain all those results.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.870
But here, you can see
that, at the same time,

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:15.730
the photons are very good
tool or very good viewpoint

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.280
to explain the
photoelectric effect.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:24.130
So that's actually
really surprising.

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:27.430
Because that means
you have, suddenly,

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:30.860
both kinds of explanation
of light, which should

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.240
be describing the same thing.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:39.050
So now, one idea is to
describe them by waves.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:43.390
The other idea is to
describe them by particles.

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.740
And also, at the same
time, as we actually

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.820
discussed in the
previous lecture,

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:55.930
we can do a two-slit
experiment with billiard balls

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.720
or with bullets.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.530
Suppose we do this experiment.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:08.900
We fire the balls or
bullets through some source.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:16.100
And we have some kind
of two-slit set up here,

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.060
so that the bullets or balls
can actually pass through.

00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.880
And then we were
wondering, what will

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.270
be the pattern which we
see from the detector

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.230
in the right-hand side.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.610
And basically, what we
see is the following.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.910
So basically, we
have a distribution

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:39.800
of the balls coming
from slit number one.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.750
And we have another distribution
of balls, which is actually

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.230
coming from slit number two.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:52.220
And I can call it P-1 and
P-2, which is actually

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.940
the probability
density distribution

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.350
of the experimental result.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:03.350
And the final result,
or say, if you just

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:05.920
look at the
distribution of balls

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.990
without separating the
balls from slit number

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.810
one and slit number
two, basically you

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.320
get some distribution
like this, which

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.750
is a superpositional P-1
and the P-2 distributions.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:28.530
All of these things
doesn't surprise anybody.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:34.540
The experiment one,
which we perform--

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:41.130
now, instead of billiard balls,
we perform the same experiment

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.380
with electrons.

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.230
And again, we have
all those electrons

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:53.790
pass through this two-slit
two-slit experiment.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.390
As we see before,
basically, again, we

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:04.060
can actually separate electrons
from the first slit, which

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:12.220
I called I-1, and the
intensity of electrons

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.840
coming from the second
slit, which I called I-2.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.510
Then, basically, if you
can identify and make sure

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.990
that the electron is coming
from one of the slits,

00:14:22.990 --> 00:14:26.910
you are going to get
distribution like this.

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:28.000
OK?

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.790
And of course, I can always
write these I-1 as a sine wave

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.480
function, psi-1 squared.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:41.280
And I can always write this
I-2, which is the intensity

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.610
as a function of position of the
electron coming from the second

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:46.870
slit--

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.580
I can always write
it as psi-2 squared.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.980
In the case of
light, it's actually

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:02.380
just proportional to
the electric field.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.520
So if you accept this,
and now you actually

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.620
don't measure where
the electron actually

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.050
pass through when the
electron from the source

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.910
passed through this experiment--

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:20.650
we now don't measure if it
passed through one or two.

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:23.850
Then, the pattern
becomes like this.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:29.690
You have something like
this which, essentially,

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:35.860
is very, very similar to
the two-slit interference

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:42.190
experimental result of
the laser experiment.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:46.570
As you see from this
experimental result,

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.480
you see some kind of pattern.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.300
You have the peak.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:54.570
You have the valley,
as a function

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:57.470
of position in the detector.

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:02.590
And we can actually call
this I-1-2, which is actually

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:08.320
when you don't measure
or you don't identify

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.600
which slit the
electron goes through,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.740
then you have the intensity,
which is actually called I-1-2.

00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:22.400
And what we actually found
is that I-1-2 is actually

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.890
not I-1 plus I-2.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:32.020
What we found is that
I-1-2 is actually psi-1

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.045
plus psi-2 squared.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:43.000
So basically, we see
interference pattern.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.952
And this will be equal to I-1
plus I-2 plus 2 squared root

00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:55.840
of I-1 plus I-2 and
the cosine delta,

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:03.170
where the delta is coming from
the path length difference.

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.490
So based on this
experimental result,

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:10.609
this is actually
really surprising.

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:16.829
First of all, electrons are
arriving like a particle,

00:17:16.829 --> 00:17:17.329
right?

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:20.869
Because we can see
from this slide,

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:26.662
if you look at the upper left
figure, you see doo-doo-doo.

00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:31.010
Every time, you have
something hitting the screen.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:33.160
And what is actually left over?

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.260
It's a single hit on the screen.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:43.190
Therefore, the electrons are
arriving like a particle,

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:46.250
producing a hit in the detector.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.760
On the other hand,
what we are saying here

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.420
is that, before
they hit the screen,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.800
they are behaving like a wave.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.940
It has interference with
itself, like a wave.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.310
All right, so is
electron a particle?

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.845
Or is the electron a wave?

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.130
Strange.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.490
The answer is
electron is actually

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.225
neither of them in reality.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.240
So how about we actually
do some more experiments

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.110
to convince ourselves what
is actually really going on.

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:37.550
So what we could do--

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.730
as I actually mentioned.

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.620
I can still have
the electronic gun.

00:18:44.368 --> 00:18:49.740
I have electron source
in the left-hand side.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.980
Again, I have this
two-slit experiment here.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:07.170
Then what I'm going to do is
to produce a light source here.

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:13.590
OK, I put a light source there
to shine the whole experiment.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.040
Then, I was wondering
what is going

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:21.350
to happen to the distribution.

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:28.930
So if I first close the
lower slit, slit number two,

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:32.880
and only measure the intensity
coming front slit number 1,

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.116
then this is the distribution
I get, which is I-1.

00:19:36.116 --> 00:19:41.030
If I close the upper one
and open only the lower one,

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:45.410
I get a distribution
which is I-2.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:49.480
And this light
source, essentially

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.780
interacting with the
electron-- when electrons

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.270
pass through this slit,
what is going to happen

00:19:58.270 --> 00:20:02.000
is that you'll see some
scattered light coming

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.410
from the slit.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:07.690
Therefore, you can know which
slit the electron actually

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:09.770
passed through.

00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:13.370
And if I do this
experiment result--

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:17.730
if I block one of the slits,
this is the distribution, I-1

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:22.400
and I-2 and now I'm
going to open both slits,

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.090
and you will see light
coming out of the slit

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:31.160
when the electron pass slit
number one or slit number two.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.190
You can identify which slit
fora all the electrons passing

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:37.160
through this experiment.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:44.900
And the resulting distribution
of electrons on the screen

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:46.500
is actually like this.

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.370
It's actually like I-1 plus I-2.

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:53.870
There will be no interference.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.850
Why is that?

00:20:55.850 --> 00:21:00.360
Now, this because you
know very precisely which

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.190
slit the electron
actually passed through,

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:06.070
this experiment.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:11.520
And also, we can say that,
huh, the electrons are actually

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.420
disturbed.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:18.580
Therefore, they now behave like
bullets or like billiard balls.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.160
So this is actually
a bit strange.

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:32.020
Maybe it is because the
intensity of the light

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:33.860
is too large.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.380
Therefore, it's changing the
behavior of the electron.

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:41.890
So what are we going to do now?

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:45.040
Experimental result
number three is

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:53.000
to lower the intensity
of the light.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.580
So what will happen if
I lower the intensity

00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:06.040
of the light source so that we
would like to see the behavior,

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.020
as a function of intensity?

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:18.060
So at some point, we will find
that some of the electrons

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.420
are not heated by a photon.

00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.520
Or say, there will be no
scattered light of the electron

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.730
when it passes through
the experiment.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:34.710
Because the intensity of
the light is too small.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:40.410
And we already know, from
photoelectric experiments,

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.800
light is, essentially,
also like quanta.

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.580
So when the intensity
is low enough,

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:54.210
the effectiveness of the
light source decreases.

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:57.890
Then the experimental
result would be like what?

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:01.570
Can somebody actually
give a guess?

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:06.840
Is that going to be like
experimental result number one?

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:11.570
Or is that going to be like
experimental result number two?

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.165
Anybody want to get--

00:23:16.165 --> 00:23:18.812
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:18.812 --> 00:23:19.770
YEN-JIE LEE: Very good.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:26.130
So the result-- as I mentioned
before, sometimes the electrons

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:30.490
are detected by
the light source.

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:34.860
Sometimes the
electrons are lucky.

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:38.610
They pass through without
getting heated by a photon.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:41.430
Therefore, you cannot
know which slit, actually,

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.110
this electron went through.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.170
Therefore, the
experimental result

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:51.180
is that, if I just lower the
intensity of the light source,

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:55.760
then what I'm going to get is a
mixture of experimental result

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:02.310
number one and the
experimental result number two.

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:05.910
When I have the
intensity low enough--

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:09.200
going to really, really
low intensity limit--

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:14.280
the result will become
experimental result number one.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.520
Because then you are
not really impacting

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.120
the position of the electrons.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.990
Finally, you can actually
suggest something else.

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:33.110
So OK, now I have low
intensity of light.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:37.190
One way to lower the intensity
is like what I was saying.

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:39.410
The rate of the
photon emission--

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.470
I can make it lower and lower.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:43.590
All right?

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.690
There's another way to do this.

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:53.870
Experimental result
number four--

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.980
so what will happen
if I use this formula

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:04.100
E equal to h bar mu equal
to hc divided by lambda?

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:08.470
Because mu is actually
just c over lambda.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:14.690
What will happen if
I, instead of lowering

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:20.830
the rate of photon
emission, I lower the energy

00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:23.410
of individual photons?

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.610
How do I do that?

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:31.440
What I could do is to
lower the frequency

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.700
of the electromagnetic
wave of the light source

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.380
or, say, increase
the wavelengths

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.850
of the light source.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.090
OK, this is very nice.

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:47.640
Because now, I can
keep this in, right?

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.340
So that I make sure
all the electrons

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:54.660
are bothered by the photon.

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:57.310
Because I can emit
very high rate.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:26:00.850
But at the same time, I can
also lower the intensity,

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:04.920
so that the intensity
is very, very low.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.620
Can anybody guess what
is going to happen?

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.670
With a result like
experimental result number one,

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:18.870
when I go to extremely
low intensity?

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:24.330
Or my result will be like
experimental result number two?

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:29.620
Because each electrons
are bothered,

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:37.170
are heated, by the emission
from the light source.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:40.330
Anybody want to try?

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:42.180
Just guess, no?

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.796
One or two?

00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:47.325
Or a mixture of them?

00:26:47.325 --> 00:26:49.200
AUDIENCE: Be like two.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.940
YEN-JIE LEE: The
guess is that it's

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:54.450
going to be like two, which
was actually well-motivated.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.120
Very good try.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.400
What essentially,
happens is that--

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.580
OK, I can say, oh!

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:05.280
Each electron are bothered
by many, many photons.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.160
So those are disturbed.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:15.480
Therefore, it has to look like
experimental result number two.

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.360
The answer may surprise you.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.290
The answer is that,
if I have the limit

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:28.370
lambda goes to
infinity, mu goes to 0,

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:32.170
what is going to happen
is that, no matter how

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:37.330
high frequency of
photon emission I have,

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:44.700
I am going to get the result
of experimental number one.

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.651
Why is that?

00:27:46.651 --> 00:27:51.190
Now, this is because
when the wavelengths

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:55.840
of the electromagnetic
wave or the photon is going

00:27:55.840 --> 00:28:07.370
to infinity, that means you
cannot resolve which slit,

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:10.780
actually, the
electron goes through.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:15.790
Because if I draw
the wavelengths here,

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.770
it's going to be like this.

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:22.450
If you observe some
kind of scattered light

00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:31.190
from the electron, it
could come from both slits,

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:33.620
because the wavelength
is too long.

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.780
So if you go to
infinity, then it's

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:39.640
like you have a constant
electric field there.

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.690
It doesn't really
actually help you

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:45.480
to identify which slit
the electron actually

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.150
passed through.

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:52.490
So therefore, the interference
pattern reappears.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:58.430
So this is really crazy thing,
if you look at all these four

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:01.870
experimental results.

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:07.090
The conclusion from these
four imaginary experiments

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:11.830
is that it is not
yet possible to tell

00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:17.320
the position of the electron
and also, at the same time,

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.830
do not disturb it.

00:29:20.830 --> 00:29:26.470
If you were able to tell the
position of the electron,

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:29.950
then there would be no
interference pattern.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.700
On the other hand, if
your experimental set-up

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:38.810
have no ability at all to
tell if the electron's coming

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:42.550
from slit number one
compared to slit number two,

00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:49.310
then you are going to
get interference pattern.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:53.470
There's another thing which I
would like to make connection

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:57.490
to the Uncertainty Principle,
which we actually learn

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:01.210
from waves and vibrations.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:12.170
So we have learned that
Heisenberg's Uncertainty

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:12.860
Principle--

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.420
this is essentially
purity coming

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:28.760
from the property of the
wave, if you actually

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.700
remember the deviation
which we have

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.830
done in the previous lecture.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:38.690
So what is this uncertainty
principle telling us?

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:44.595
Is that the standard
deviation of the position

00:30:44.595 --> 00:30:50.840
times the standard
deviation of the momentum

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:57.560
is going to be greater or equal
to h bar over 2 some constant.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.710
And how do we actually
understand this

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:05.430
from the electron experiment.

00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:10.220
That is actually highly related
to the single-slit experiment

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:11.810
with electrons.

00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:17.810
So what we could do now is
to have a fifth experiment.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.470
I have electron source here.

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:25.820
And I have a single slit.

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:32.000
And the width of the
slit is capital D.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.780
And we were wondering,
what is going to happen?

00:31:35.780 --> 00:31:39.250
What will be recorded
by the smoke detector

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.880
in the right-hand side?

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:43.610
And by now, it should
not surprise you

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:49.250
that this would give you some
kind of diffraction pattern,

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.990
which you say should be very
similar to what we actually

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:56.740
observe with laser experiments.

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.390
So you can see that.

00:31:58.390 --> 00:32:02.590
The electron-- the momentum--

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:06.950
now, I would like to actually
define my coordinate system.

00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:14.050
The vertical direction, pointing
upward, is my x direction.

00:32:14.050 --> 00:32:19.060
So now, take a look at
this experimental result.

00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:23.530
So what this is actually
telling us is the following.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:28.030
We know the position
of the electron

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:35.870
to a accuracy of the
width of this slit, which

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.700
is D. So that is
actually telling you

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:49.300
about the uncertainty over the
position in the x direction.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:53.710
Now, this electron goes through.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:58.910
And they actually
hit the screen.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:06.070
And each electron is
having a single path.

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:11.770
If I look at one of the paths,
the upper one, what I'm getting

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:17.496
is that there must be a
momentum quintessentially

00:33:17.496 --> 00:33:22.820
in the x direction, when
this electronic goes

00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:28.440
through the slit
and hits the screen.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.180
One interesting thing we
learned from the deviation

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:40.790
from last time is that, if I
just look at the slide here--

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:43.910
if I look at the
left-hand side slide--

00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:49.150
if I have a very small slit--

00:33:49.150 --> 00:33:53.180
D is small-- what does
that correspond to?

00:33:53.180 --> 00:34:01.820
That corresponds to delta x
goes to very small value case.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.250
We have a small delta x value.

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:08.360
You are really sure
where is the electron

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:15.940
at some instant of time, when it
passed through the experiment.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.179
Then what is going to happen?

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.429
If you look at the
right-hand side,

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:25.810
the distribution on the screen,
you have a wide distribution.

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:29.570
The central maximum
peak will be very wide.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:30.830
So what does that mean?

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:34.250
That means you have
a wide distribution

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.957
of momentum in the x direction.

00:34:40.889 --> 00:34:45.759
Therefore, that
will give you that

00:34:45.759 --> 00:34:48.860
is actually consistent with what
we've actually written here,

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.460
Heisenberg's Principle.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.239
Delta x times delta p will be
greater or equal to some value.

00:34:55.239 --> 00:35:01.410
On the other hand, if I
increase the width of the slit,

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.735
the D is now large.

00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:08.460
As you are making a D larger
and larger, what is happening

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:13.550
is that the central
peak, the width,

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:18.120
is actually going to be
narrower and narrower.

00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.130
Now, this is actually
also consistent with what

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:23.250
we have learned from
Heisenberg's Uncertainty

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:24.030
Principle.

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:29.990
When delta x become even larger,
then the uncertainty or, say,

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:35.320
the distribution of the
momentum in the x direction,

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.310
becomes smaller.

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:41.940
So now, we actually also
understand a little bit more

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:46.200
about what the single
diffraction actually means.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:51.720
And this issue is really closely
connected to the Uncertainty

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.500
Principle Heisenberg
actually proposed.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:58.530
And if we use the
mathematics which

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:01.780
we learned from last
time, the C function

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:06.060
is going to be proportional
to integration from minus D

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:09.150
over 2 to D over 2.

00:36:09.150 --> 00:36:15.990
dx exponential as ikx times x.

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:19.870
And if I have D
goes to infinity,

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:24.240
which means that you have
an infinitely wide slit--

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.530
based on the formula which
we have derived last time--

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:34.680
basically, we will see that C
function is a function of kx.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.380
It's going to become
a delta function.

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:47.270
And this delta
function is delta kx.

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:51.720
So that means, if you
have absolutely no idea

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:56.670
about the position
of the electron,

00:36:56.670 --> 00:37:03.950
you are going to get very, very
precise information about--

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.200
the momentum in the x
direction is actually

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.620
going to be equal to 0.

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.160
Because it's a delta function.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:19.820
It's only nonzero at kx, which
is the directional propagation

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.050
equal to 0.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:24.090
Any questions so far?

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.930
OK, so from those
experimental results,

00:37:31.930 --> 00:37:40.900
we've found that the probability
of getting heat on the screen

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:45.850
is proportional to
psi-1 square, if I only

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:49.550
have the first lead there.

00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:56.430
That means the probability, p,
is proportional to psi squared.

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:03.650
And this is actually
probably one

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:11.420
of the most crazy results in
the physics we learned so far.

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.550
In some sense, it's
kind of sad as well.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.020
Why sad?

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:24.680
This means that, OK, I can
calculate those wave functions.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.220
And the probability
of getting an outcome

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:32.910
at a specific position is
proportional to this wave

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.685
function squared.

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:40.990
But I feel, maybe,
demotivated, right?

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:44.150
Because originally,
we are like god.

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.520
You can predict--

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.440
OK, I have this
thing, this object.

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.150
And I have force.

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:52.790
And then it goes like--
oh-- like this way.

00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:58.510
I can calculate the
trajectory of this chalk thing

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:00.530
all over the place,
as a function of time.

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:02.930
And I know what is
going to happen.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:07.490
I have the full control
of all the objects

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:12.160
which I have in my
hand in my experiment.

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:18.560
But now, quantum mechanics
or this experimental result

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:23.360
tells me that we
can only predict

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:29.350
the probability, the odd,
instead of the outcome.

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:31.460
You see my point?

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.110
I can only pretend the wave
function, the distribution

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:36.730
of the wave function.

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:40.660
And the probability of
getting a result here

00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.810
is proportional to the
wave function squared.

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:48.600
But I cannot predict the outcome
before I do the experiment.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:58.180
That's really a big
change in your view

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:03.105
or, they say, in our current
understanding of the physics.

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:11.080
You can say that, well,
maybe Yen-Jie's not

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.800
working hard enough.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:22.840
Maybe all those electrons which
are emitted from the electron

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:26.830
source already
made up their mind

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.520
where this electron is going to.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.444
For example, electron number
one is doing this-- rrrrr--

00:40:35.444 --> 00:40:36.760
and going to here.

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:39.820
And electron number two
already made up his mind.

00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:41.560
He's just going to do this.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.940
And the electron
number three is-- uh--

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.630
maybe do this--
vwooo-do-do-do-do.

00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:53.410
And then all those trajectories
are already determined.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:59.960
And they are heating variables
which Yen-Jie doesn't know.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.280
Therefore, he screwed this
up and said, oh, come on.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.898
We can only predict
the probability.

00:41:07.898 --> 00:41:15.400
But the thing is that, from the
experimental result number two,

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:19.660
experimental result number
three and number four,

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:26.560
you can see that the electrons
cannot make up their mind when

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:28.210
they are emitted.

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:32.620
Because when they got
heated by that light--

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.370
electrons cannot know in advance
that it is going to be heated

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.830
by a light.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:43.690
And the light can be a very,
very mild, very, very small

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:44.300
energy.

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:50.410
So that it should not
affect the predetermined

00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:53.760
path of the electron.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:56.420
Do you get this?

00:41:56.420 --> 00:41:57.790
So that doesn't makes sense.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:03.050
So it is not because
Yen-Jie is not trying hard.

00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:07.580
It is really because
nobody can really

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:14.720
tell before the experimental
result is actually shown

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:18.200
or the measurement
is already done.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:23.970
If you can find
any case, maybe you

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:27.430
will win another
100 Nobel Prize.

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:32.170
Because you are showing that the
whole understanding of quantum

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:37.820
mechanics is not
correct, really.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:40.900
Please tell me when you actually
have done this experiment.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:46.290
I will be very proud
of you, for sure.

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.170
So now, we are
entering a position

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:53.370
to discuss this result.
So now, actually, we

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:57.540
can also make use of
this understanding

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:01.560
and predict what would be
the particle probability

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:05.370
distribution in
a potential well.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:12.240
Suppose I have an experiment,
which I have a well,

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.140
where I have potential
goes to infinity

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.060
in the left-hand side
or right-hand side

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.010
edge of this well.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.740
And I will define
my coordinate system

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.750
so that the well is
actually equal to 0,

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:35.140
or x equal to L. So by
now, when you see this,

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:37.980
this looks really
familiar to you.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:40.320
In the center part,
you have some kind

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.630
of translation symmetry.

00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:45.780
And the boundary-- those
are forbidden regions.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.540
You cannot actually
have particles there,

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.290
because the potential
is infinity.

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.530
Therefore, this is
actually giving you

00:43:55.530 --> 00:44:04.250
boundary conditions
of the wave function,

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:11.920
describing the state of the
particle inside this box.

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.000
So the boundary
condition would be psi 0.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.340
It will be equal to 0,
because it's actually

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:22.080
at the left-hand side
edge of the well,

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.070
where you have
infinite potential.

00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:31.880
And also, you can have psi
L. This will be equal to 0,

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.380
because the
right-hand side edge,

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:43.890
you also have infinitely
high potential.

00:44:43.890 --> 00:44:49.620
Therefore, when you see
this, your immediate reaction

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.485
will be, how do I
know what is this?

00:44:52.485 --> 00:44:54.560
This is actually psi m.

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:56.430
The solution to
this problem must

00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:59.810
be something like
psi m of x should be

00:44:59.810 --> 00:45:02.580
the normal mode of this system.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:09.330
And it's going to
be A-m sin km-x,

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:16.095
where km will be equal
to m-pi divided by L,

00:45:16.095 --> 00:45:17.880
where m is a number.

00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.660
It can be 1, 2, 3-- it
goes to infinity, right?

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:23.730
By far, you have
actually learned

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:28.900
all these practical calculations
from the previous examples

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.100
we had.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:38.510
Therefore, what would be the
psi m, x as a function of time?

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:44.410
Then what I am going
to get is A-m sin km

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:48.570
x exponential minus i omega-m t.

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:59.350
Of course, we can also really
plot all those results.

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:02.990
So for example, n is equal to 1.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:07.360
Basically, what you are
getting is like this.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.730
Doesn't surprise you.

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:14.250
This is actually psi
as a function of x.

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:17.050
And n equal to 2--

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.480
this will correspond
to the situation

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:29.680
where you have one node in the
middle, et cetera, et cetera.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:36.780
You can't have many, many
higher m value solutions.

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:40.180
And what would be
the probability

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:45.160
to find the particle
in a specific location?

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:48.460
That's why we mentioned
before, the probability is

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:52.390
proportional to a
wave function squared.

00:46:52.390 --> 00:47:01.540
Therefore, the probability will
be proportional to sin squared

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.470
k-m x.

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:06.630
And what we are going
to get is like this.

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:12.150
If I plot m equal to 1,
using P as a function of x,

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:19.720
the probability of getting a
particle at a specific place,

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:24.670
if we are looking at the
situation in normal mode number

00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:27.400
one, that is like this.

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:31.210
You are much more likely
to find a particle

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:34.620
in the middle of the box.

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:39.600
On the other hand, we can
also plot the probability

00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:43.870
as function of x, where
m equals to 2 k's.

00:47:43.870 --> 00:47:48.850
If we are actually operating
in a second normal mode,

00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:53.080
then basically you have some
distribution-- looks like this.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.410
In this situation, it
is forbidden-- or say,

00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:58.780
there's zero
probability you will

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.820
find the particle in
the middle of the box,

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.010
et cetera, et cetera.

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:09.850
You can actually calculate all
those corresponding probability

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:14.170
distributions as a
function of m value

00:48:14.170 --> 00:48:17.630
and as a function of position.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:18.680
OK?

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:21.560
Sounds like a very good story.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:24.660
But there's something
missing, right?

00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:27.630
What is actually missing?

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.710
You have the normal modes.

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.680
You have the k-m.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:37.320
What is missing is
the wave equation.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:40.920
The wave equation
is missing, right?

00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:44.070
You don't have the
dispersion relation.

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:47.250
This solution is incomplete.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.370
You don't know what is
actually the omega value.

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.650
Because you don't have
dispersion relation.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:03.750
So what is actually
the wave equation

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:06.820
for the quantum mechanics?

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:11.170
So it is actually
Schrodinger's equation.

00:49:11.170 --> 00:49:14.890
So Feynman once
commented on the origin

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.590
of the Schrodinger's Equation.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:18.910
It's from where?

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:25.360
It's not possible to derive
it from anything you know.

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:30.050
It's just coming out of the
might Schrodinger, actually.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.540
So there's no reason.

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:33.970
And it works.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.280
That's the beautiful part.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:38.840
So what is, actually,
this equation?

00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:41.700
So this is the equation
Schrodinger actually

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:43.450
writes down.

00:49:43.450 --> 00:49:47.410
It's like i h-bar--

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:53.170
Plank's constant,
partial/partial t, psi xt.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:57.840
And this will be equal
to minus h bar squared

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:08.672
over 2m partial square, partial
x square, plus v xt, psi xt.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:14.140
So this is really nice.

00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:19.060
And it works and matches
with experimental results.

00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:22.010
And now, I have already
the normal mode.

00:50:22.010 --> 00:50:24.460
I can plug that
into this equation

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:27.070
to see what I can
actually learn from there.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:31.780
So what I am going to do
is to plug in psi-m xt

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:36.220
into this equation, to get
the dispersion relation.

00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:38.290
So what this issue, the
dispersion relation.

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:40.450
So here, I have
partial/partial t.

00:50:40.450 --> 00:50:46.000
So I extract one omega
minus i omega out of this.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:52.935
Then, basically, I get
h bar omega-m psi-m xt

00:50:52.935 --> 00:50:54.310
in the lambda psi.

00:50:54.310 --> 00:51:00.470
OK, plugging in psi-m into this
equation and see what happens.

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:03.070
Then this will be equal to--

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:09.550
I also know that, in the middle
of the box, v, essentially,

00:51:09.550 --> 00:51:11.700
the potential--

00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:14.500
the potential is
0 inside the box.

00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:19.180
The potential is infinity
at the edge of the box.

00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:23.800
Therefore, I can safely ignore
this term, to be equal to 0.

00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:27.760
So you have a free path
to go inside the box.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.330
And what, essentially,
this term--

00:51:31.330 --> 00:51:36.560
this term will give you
minus h-bar square over 2m.

00:51:36.560 --> 00:51:38.950
OK, I have a double
differential of x.

00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:45.680
And therefore, I get, basically,
minus km squared, right?

00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.320
Because it's psi zeta, right?

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.240
So basically, I get
minus k squared.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:53.890
So therefore, I cancel
this minus sign.

00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:59.530
I have km squared out
of this calculation.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:02.650
And I still have psi-m xt.

00:52:06.310 --> 00:52:08.050
I can cancel this too.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:16.850
Then, what I'm getting is that
omega-m is equal to km squared,

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:17.820
h-bar--

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:22.360
I cancel one of the h-bar here--

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.620
divided by 2m.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:33.132
This-- essentially, dispersion
relation of the wave function.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:54.850
De Broglie proposed that
wavelengths of the matter wave,

00:52:54.850 --> 00:53:01.690
essentially, highly related
to the momentum of the matter.

00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:07.000
So basically, he propose that
p, the momentum of the particle

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.140
is actually equal to h-bar
k, where k is the wave

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:14.680
number of the matter wave.

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:20.950
If you accept de Broglie's
interpretation, basically what

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:24.340
we are getting is something
really, really interesting.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:29.510
If we put together this
dispersion relation

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:35.730
and the de Broglie's
interpretation of matter wave--

00:53:35.730 --> 00:53:44.100
what I am going to do is to
calculate the group velocity

00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:46.350
of this dispersion relation.

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:48.600
So I can now calculate--

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:55.500
group velocity, V-g, will
be equal to d omega, dk.

00:53:55.500 --> 00:54:00.090
And I know that omega is equal
to h-bar k squared divided

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:01.730
by 2m.

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:09.420
This is essentially equal
to h-bar k divided by m.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:12.350
Everybody is following?

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:13.800
OK.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:16.050
And this is equal to what?

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:21.710
This is equal to p divided by
m, if I use de Broglie's matter

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:23.670
wave.

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:29.910
Therefore, you have p
equal to m times ng.

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:31.020
Wow!

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:31.615
Look at this.

00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.400
What are we getting here?

00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:43.590
What we are getting here is that
the group velocity of the wave

00:54:43.590 --> 00:54:48.340
equation of the
waves is actually

00:54:48.340 --> 00:54:56.860
the classical velocity, p
equal to m times v. Now,

00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:01.330
everything actually is
becoming more and more clear.

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:08.050
We know and we learned
already, from 8.03, what is

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:10.670
the meaning of group velocity.

00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:14.590
The meaning of
the group velocity

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:22.540
is the speed of the propagation
of a wave package, right?

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:30.010
Remember our discussion
before about a AM radio?

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:35.350
So what is actually the speed
of propagation of a wave packet

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:38.830
is the group velocity.

00:55:38.830 --> 00:55:42.640
So now we have
solved the problem--

00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:48.120
why electron can be a
particle, at the same time,

00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:51.288
also like waves.

00:55:51.288 --> 00:55:58.190
It's essentially described
by wave functions.

00:55:58.190 --> 00:56:03.820
The classical behavior
we see on the electron

00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.730
is because it is,
as you described,

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.740
by these wave packages.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.280
It's pretty localized.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:18.710
And the motion of this wave
package in a free space

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:23.050
is actually the speed
of the propagation--

00:56:23.050 --> 00:56:25.550
is the group velocity.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:29.570
Therefore, there
is no contradiction

00:56:29.570 --> 00:56:32.270
between the
classical calculation

00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:36.030
and the wave interpretation
of the electron.

00:56:36.030 --> 00:56:40.830
So that really
surprised me very much.

00:56:40.830 --> 00:56:47.000
And you can see that, given
the dispersion relation, also,

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.640
this is a rather
dynamical result.

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:56.990
The real part of the wave
function is actually blue.

00:56:56.990 --> 00:57:00.200
And the imaginary
part is actually red.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.960
It's actually
oscillating up and down.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.440
And the oscillation
frequency, by now,

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:11.410
you know is governed by
that dispersion relation.

00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:16.900
OK, now actually, everything
seems to make sense now--

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:20.570
really, really, very cool.

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.940
So on the other
hand, we also have

00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:25.850
to live with
probability density.

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:31.070
So you cannot tell the exact
position of a particle any

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:31.670
more.

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:36.470
You cannot tell the exact
outcome of an experiment

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:37.510
anymore.

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:42.560
And that is actually to do
with this interpretation.

00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:47.690
And all of those phenomena,
at a very, very small scale,

00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:50.900
is actually described by
quantum mechanics, which we

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:53.150
will learn some more in 8.04.

00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:55.430
And also, in the
future, you will

00:57:55.430 --> 00:58:00.980
be governed by the quantum
field theory, which

00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:04.360
is actually a father future.

00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:10.270
And what is actually the life
living with quantum mechanics

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.440
and quantum field theory?

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:14.567
So this is a very simple--

00:58:14.567 --> 00:58:15.361
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:15.361 --> 00:58:19.810
--Lagrangian of
the standard model.

00:58:19.810 --> 00:58:26.080
And it describes everything
except the gravity.

00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:26.860
OK?

00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:28.160
And it's really simple.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.850
It's called Standard Model.

00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:34.630
And look at this part.

00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:42.010
This is governing the
Higgs decay to Z boson.

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:47.060
And the experimental result--
we don't really know what

00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:49.120
is the mass of the Higgs.

00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:53.320
It's a missing
observable before.

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:57.730
And on the other hand,
as a particle physicist

00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:02.020
or as a high energy
nuclear physicists,

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:07.630
I have no idea about what will
happen in the next collision.

00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:08.210
Why is that?

00:59:08.210 --> 00:59:10.270
You know the reason now, right?

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:14.290
Because we cannot
predict the exact outcome

00:59:14.290 --> 00:59:15.580
of our experiment.

00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:19.120
It's all governed
by wave functions.

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:23.600
Therefore, what we are
doing is the following.

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:27.020
We are doing the brute force.

00:59:27.020 --> 00:59:30.130
So we collide like crazy--

00:59:30.130 --> 00:59:33.340
collide, collide, collide,
collide like crazy,

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:36.975
until something
interesting pops out.

00:59:36.975 --> 00:59:38.350
That's actually
what we're really

00:59:38.350 --> 00:59:42.160
doing as a particle physicist.

00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:47.500
And this is your beautiful event
from proton-proton collisions

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:51.940
at the Large Hadron Collider--
is a Higgs to the boson event.

00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:58.680
And one of the Z bosons
becomes the two red lines.

00:59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.000
It's actually the two muons.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.980
And the other
decays to electrons,

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:07.070
which are detected by
the kilometer as the two

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.230
blue things there.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:14.590
As a high-energy
nuclear physicist,

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:18.730
I am interested
in the production

01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:23.590
of quark-gluon plasma
from lead ion collisions.

01:00:23.590 --> 01:00:29.560
So I am now putting together
two ions, have them collide.

01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:32.680
And I hope that,
by chance, I can

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:37.780
deposit a huge amount of
energy in a very small volume.

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:41.930
And then I would like to
see this crazy matter,

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:47.060
actually, gradually expand
and become a lot of particles.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:50.020
And I study those
particles to understand,

01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:53.470
what would be the nature
of this material, which

01:00:53.470 --> 01:00:56.410
starts to exist in
the very early part

01:00:56.410 --> 01:00:59.200
of the whole universe history?

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.630
Just one microsecond
after the Big Bang,

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:05.710
we have the whole universe
filled by this crazy material.

01:01:05.710 --> 01:01:08.850
And we are creating
this in the experiment.

01:01:08.850 --> 01:01:13.810
And we will only be able to
hope that, OK, by chance, I

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.550
have the collision happen.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:19.840
By chance, I have a very
high-density environment.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:24.190
Somehow, multiple quanta decide
to scatter on each other.

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:27.140
And they deposit the energy
in a very small volume.

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:30.910
And then we collect all
those spectacular events

01:01:30.910 --> 01:01:34.780
to study the properties of
all those little Big Bangs.

01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:40.720
So that is actually the
consequence of this wave

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.880
function interpretation.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:48.890
So now, coming back to the
Standard Model, this really

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:54.290
simple one, you can't see,
that is a theory of almost

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:58.630
everything, except the gravity.

01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:59.570
Really sad.

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:02.820
So if you can actually
put them all together,

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.540
then you will also
win the Nobel Prize.

01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:08.840
And giving you all
those ideas, so that I

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.260
can have a very good student
winning the Nobel Prize.

01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:14.090
Of course you will.

01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:19.250
And now, I would like to discuss
and use the remaining, maybe,

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:24.800
10 minutes to discuss
with you the gravity.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:31.560
So here is actually
something related to gravity.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:38.180
So Einstein actually
predicted that the distortion

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:42.650
of the space-time
generated by objects

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:45.860
can travel through the space.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:48.020
I don't have the
derivation here,

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:52.350
because it would take another,
maybe, two hours to do this.

01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:55.910
But I would like to
ask you to trust me.

01:02:55.910 --> 01:03:01.850
This is actually a result
coming from general relativity.

01:03:01.850 --> 01:03:07.040
And you can see
that we can actually

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.850
generate gravitational waves.

01:03:09.850 --> 01:03:13.550
And I can actually do
the generation here,

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:16.760
like this and rotating.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.320
I'm generating
gravitational waves.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:21.320
And that student in the
back is also generating.

01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:21.970
Yes, you are.

01:03:21.970 --> 01:03:23.330
Yeah, you are generating.

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:24.290
Everybody's generating.

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:25.880
Ah, you are also generating.

01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.460
Yeah, very good.

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:31.820
But the problem is that
the space-time distortion

01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:38.120
is really small for people who
are not very massive, like me.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.020
So that's a problem.

01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:41.710
So I can generate.

01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:43.290
I'm doing the demo here.

01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:45.740
But it doesn't help.

01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.800
You cannot really detect them.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.420
And even Einstein himself thinks
it's impossible to detect them,

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:56.720
maybe, in our lifetime.

01:03:56.720 --> 01:04:00.260
And what would be the
outcome of the calculation?

01:04:00.260 --> 01:04:02.330
The outcome of the calculation--

01:04:02.330 --> 01:04:10.130
if you have gravitational
wave passing toward you--

01:04:10.130 --> 01:04:12.540
so what it does
is the following.

01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:17.480
So basically, the space
is distorted in a way such

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:20.390
that it first expands
in this direction

01:04:20.390 --> 01:04:23.510
and then expanding the other
direction, perpendicular

01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:25.470
to the original distortion.

01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:29.000
And if you put a
ray of particles,

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.160
the circular array of particles,
and look at what is going on,

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:37.030
when the gravitational
wave pass through it,

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:40.580
it pass through the array
in this direction, what

01:04:40.580 --> 01:04:45.040
you are going to get
is effect like that.

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.620
Of course, this
is actually highly

01:04:47.620 --> 01:04:50.920
exaggerated in this set-up.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:55.990
You don't really see this
kind of sizable distortion

01:04:55.990 --> 01:04:58.600
when Yen-Jie is dancing around.

01:05:01.170 --> 01:05:06.780
OK, so how about we actually
visualize this thing.

01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:10.200
The problem is that we
cannot really see the space

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.690
distortion.

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:15.740
But what we can, as
you see, is the light

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:19.500
which actually pass through
those little distortions.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:23.810
So this is a stimulation
from LIGO Collaboration.

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:30.740
They are simulating the merging
of the two massive black holes.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.480
And you can see that
they are rotating

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.490
with respect to each other.

01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:41.010
They are radiating energy
out of this two-body system.

01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:42.710
Let's take a look at this again.

01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:49.400
So this is actually a simulation
of the event observed by LIGO.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:58.640
So both black holes have a mass
roughly 30 times of our sun.

01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.840
It's very massive.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.750
And they are rotating with
respect to each other.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:05.430
And that generates
space-time distortion.

01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:10.050
And you can see that the
space-time distortion stops

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:12.400
after they merge each other.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.430
And we were hoping that
we can detect those.

01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:17.750
How crazy is that?

01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:23.140
So how do we detect them?

01:06:23.140 --> 01:06:26.870
Actually, you already
have the knowledge

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:30.750
to design the experiment to
detect this kind of effect.

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:35.960
So remember, the effect
of the gravitational wave

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:36.710
is like this.

01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:40.640
So you have
distortion like this.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.180
What we actually--

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:47.300
MIT and Cal Tech and the
many other collaborators

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:50.634
designed the LIGO experiment.

01:06:50.634 --> 01:06:51.800
Are what is, actually, LIGO?

01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:57.350
It's a Laser Interferometer
Gravitational wave Observatory.

01:06:57.350 --> 01:07:00.320
It is actually always good
to have a very good name

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.880
of your experiment.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:04.880
So this is actually LIGO.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.410
So what, actually, it
does is the following.

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:10.370
So basically, it emits a laser.

01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:13.260
And you split the
laser into two pieces.

01:07:13.260 --> 01:07:18.170
And there were mirrors in
the very far end, reflect

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:19.490
those lasers.

01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:21.080
And they come together.

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.560
And there is a
photo-detector, which

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:29.100
detects the interference pattern
of these two optical path

01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:29.600
lengths.

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:30.100
Wow!

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:31.780
Sounds familiar to you, right?

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:34.610
Hey, you already know how to
explain this to your friends

01:07:34.610 --> 01:07:35.480
already.

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:36.470
Really cool.

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:42.320
And in order to have
redundant management--

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:46.310
for example, if you only
have a single experiment,

01:07:46.310 --> 01:07:48.350
maybe one graduate
student is like, oh,

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:50.810
doing dancing next
to a detector.

01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:53.030
Then you see some fake signal.

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:55.610
And that's not
going to be helpful.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:58.400
So what it does is
that-- basically, we

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.760
have two experiments.

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.180
One is actually in Hanford.

01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.520
The other one is
actually in Livingston.

01:08:04.520 --> 01:08:08.990
And they are actually
3,000 kilometers away

01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:10.190
from each other.

01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:15.950
So that there should not be any
correlation between the signal

01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:19.430
coming from a
earthquake or dancing

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.939
of the graduate
students or whatever.

01:08:22.939 --> 01:08:29.330
So they can you use that to
suppress any coincidence which

01:08:29.330 --> 01:08:34.080
is actually not related
to gravitational waves.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:37.020
So what does this do?

01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:39.500
So now, we have,
oh, the knowledge

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:41.270
to actually explain
this phenomena.

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:43.210
So what this does
is the following.

01:08:43.210 --> 01:08:45.050
So you meet the laser.

01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:49.460
And when the gravitational
waves come in,

01:08:49.460 --> 01:08:53.060
then it does this
space-time distortion.

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:57.680
And then the
interference pattern

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:03.859
of the waves going through
different optical path lengths

01:09:03.859 --> 01:09:07.470
is going to change.

01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:09.760
So you can see that,
originally, the experiment

01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:13.130
is designed so that you
have complete cancellation.

01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:19.220
But when the gravitational
waves is hitting the side,

01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.319
you will be able to see that.

01:09:21.319 --> 01:09:27.130
Really, you have constructive
interference at some point,

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:31.220
because of the movement
of the mirrors.

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:35.090
And those mirrors are
really, really far away

01:09:35.090 --> 01:09:36.270
from the sources.

01:09:36.270 --> 01:09:40.010
Each of them is, like,
four kilometers away

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:42.050
from the mirror.

01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:46.220
And due to the
incredible precision

01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:48.979
which were achieved
by this experiment,

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:55.680
we will be able to detect this
signal of gravitational waves.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.650
So you can see,
again, from here--

01:09:57.650 --> 01:10:03.530
so basically, when the
gravitational wave comes in,

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:07.810
first you split the light
source into two pieces,

01:10:07.810 --> 01:10:12.200
have them hit the mirror, which
is actually four kilometers far

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:13.280
away from each other.

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:15.000
And they come back.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:20.540
And initially, the experiment
is designed so that, very

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:24.490
precisely, there
will be no amplitude

01:10:24.490 --> 01:10:27.350
detected by the photo-detector.

01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:30.810
And when the gravitational
waves come in,

01:10:30.810 --> 01:10:35.390
you actually really
change the length

01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:39.020
between a splitter
and the mirror.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:46.290
Therefore, you see light,
constructive interference even,

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:49.440
from the photo-detector.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.170
So that is really cool.

01:10:51.170 --> 01:10:55.820
And this is actually
the experimental result.

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:58.600
Look at this.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:02.360
You actually can see
that light actually

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:06.020
achieve the sensitivity.

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:14.690
The gravitational wave was first
observed on September 14, 2015.

01:11:14.690 --> 01:11:20.530
And the LIGO is actually
announcing that February 11--

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:23.590
earlier this year.

01:11:23.590 --> 01:11:27.070
And what we actually see from
here is that this is actually--

01:11:27.070 --> 01:11:28.720
as I mentioned to you--

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:31.900
there are two
measurements, two sides.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:36.760
The left hand side is actually
the measurement from Hanford.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.240
And the other one is
actually the measurement

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.370
from Livingston.

01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:44.620
So they are two
different curves.

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:51.820
And they all have almost
exactly the same pattern.

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:53.710
Of course, there's time
has actually shifted,

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:57.460
because they are in different
places on the earth.

01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:59.920
They are 3,000 kilometers apart.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.920
So therefore, there
will be a shift in time.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.960
And this is actually
a time-shifted result.

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.280
And you can see, also,
the calculation below,

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:11.390
which is actually
what you should

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:20.000
expect if you have the merger
of the two massive black holes.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.680
So you can see that they are
actually rotating with respect

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:26.230
to each other.

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:31.300
One of them is actually
29 times larger

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.450
than the mass of the sun.

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:37.210
And the other one
is 36 times larger

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:38.350
than the mass of our sun.

01:12:38.350 --> 01:12:41.110
It's not precision.

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:44.740
And they generate,
theoretically,

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:47.270
this kind of pattern.

01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:50.440
And this is actually
really detected

01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:56.680
by both LIGO experiments, which
lay at 3,000 kilometers apart

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.790
from each other.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:02.850
So I think this is really
a historical moment--

01:13:02.850 --> 01:13:06.960
that we actually were very
lucky to live in this moment.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.800
What does that mean?

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:16.300
That means we have a
new way to really hear

01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:20.660
about what the universe is
actually trying to tell us.

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:24.470
We have a new way
to detect phenomena,

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:28.310
which is actually really
happening very, very far away

01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:29.360
from the Earth.

01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.700
How far is,
actually, this event?

01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:34.655
This event, according
to calculation,

01:13:34.655 --> 01:13:42.860
is actually something like
1.3 billion light years

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:44.890
away from the Earth.

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:46.670
And we can detect that.

01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:51.061
And we even know the mass
of the two black holes.

01:13:51.061 --> 01:13:51.560
Wow!

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.730
What does that mean?

01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:56.870
This is really crazy to
me and really exciting,

01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:58.760
because we are opening up--

01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.930
OK, I have two ears.

01:13:59.930 --> 01:14:04.470
And it's opening up
another ear in my brain.

01:14:04.470 --> 01:14:09.980
And that is actually the way
to hear the gravitational wave

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.930
with the experiment
we've performed on Earth.

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:19.900
So I hope, until now,
I have convinced you

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:25.970
that this is really not the end
of vibration of waves, which

01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:29.000
is actually the end of 8.03.

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:32.550
Instead, this is actually
just the beginning.

01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:36.170
You have a lot more
to explore when

01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:39.920
you take general or
special relativity course.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:43.910
You have a lot, really,
more to explore when

01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:46.700
you take quantum mechanics.

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:51.800
And I hope you really enjoy
the content of this course.

01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.010
Personally, I really
enjoy that very much.

01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:56.360
I love this course.

01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:59.090
And I hope you also love
it and understand something

01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:00.460
from my lecture.

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:02.750
And thank you very much.

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:04.760
And the next time,
we are going to have

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:09.190
a review of all concepts we have
learned from 8.03 next Tuesday.

01:15:09.190 --> 01:15:09.790
Thank you.

01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:11.290
[APPLAUSE]

01:15:13.090 --> 01:15:15.240
Thank you very much.

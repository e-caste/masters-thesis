00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:12.460
GARY GENSLER:
Welcome to FinTech--

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.400
Shaping the World of Finance.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.160
We're going to talk about
challenger banks today.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.360
And we've chatted in our last
session about credit, payment

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.470
before that.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.590
But challenger banks
is an interesting topic

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.790
that I thought we
should take a moment

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.670
and just talk about
challenger banks.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.290
This is this concept built
upon building a bank that's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.070
internet-only, building a bank
that has no bricks and mortar

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.630
office.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.763
Now, it's not actually
a new concept.

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:50.430
And in this lecture, we're going
to talk a little bit about what

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.600
was happening even then
in the 1990s and the 2000s

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.050
when online banking started.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.260
But this term, challenger
bank, and another related term,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.140
neobanks, relates to
something a little bit later.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.220
Ally Bank, which used to
be the old auto lending

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.350
part of General
Motors, the largest--

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.350
at one point, at one point
the largest auto manufacturer

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.110
in the US--

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.400
Ally Bank in 2009 decided
it was not just going

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.275
to be an auto lender.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:27.567
They're going to become a bank.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:29.210
And in 2009, they
said they were going

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.640
to be an internet-only bank.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.030
Over in Europe, and
particularly the United Kingdom,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.890
many people say challenger
banks started in Europe,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.070
in the United
Kingdom, particularly

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.710
when the official
sector got involved

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.960
and through something
called the Payment Systems

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.540
Directive and the Payment
System Directive 2

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.750
and then later in the United
Kingdom around open banking--

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.600
we've talked about
this, about open APIs--

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.600
that it opened up the
system a little bit.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.290
And by 2013 to 2015, you saw a
slew of these challenger banks

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.610
and neobanks getting
into this space,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.720
first particularly in
Europe, then a lot in the US,

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.920
now around the globe.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.030
You can find challenger
banks and neobanks in Brazil,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.690
in India, and Southeast
Asia, in China.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.020
Some of them have been
started by big tech companies.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.000
And in the last
few years, you have

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.110
big finance reacting as well,
like Goldman Sachs starting

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.040
Marcus.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.240
And so now the term
gets a little loose.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.280
Is a challenger bank and
neobank if Goldman Sachs

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.210
is starting Marcus?

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.010
That doesn't feel like
a challenger bank.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.020
Goldman Sachs is established
140, 150-year-old investment

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.290
bank.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.230
So it gets a little blurry.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.720
And I admit that in this
space, there's sometimes

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.850
terms don't fit well together.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.550
I'm going to upload
the slides here

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.930
for a second and share slides.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.268
But Romain is there any
questions as we're starting?

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:03.310
TA: Nothing so far, Gary.

00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:15.578
GARY GENSLER: So we're
going to go back to a topic

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:17.120
that we didn't have
quite enough time

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.990
to finish in class seven, credit
scoring and alternative data.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.270
And it's an important
topic that underlies

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.820
some of what's going on
with challenger backs, not

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.420
everything.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.290
And then we're going to talk
about some traditional banking,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.740
online banking as it sort
of began in the late '90S

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:34.760
and in the noughts.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.380
And what is this new wave,
neo or challenging banks,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.420
some of how they're funded and
their own valuations, and then

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.410
the big finance reaction.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.740
So back to data--

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.410
there is a company.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.150
Many of us know it as FICO.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.370
It's actually called the Fair
Isaac Company, started 60

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.050
some years ago, started
by two Stanford graduates,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.460
not MIT, but a very
good institution.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.070
And they were more
into data analytics.

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.430
And remember, credit cards
had started in the 1950s.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.550
And here it was, the
late '50s, early 60s,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:24.882
a fintech company of its time
trying to do analysis on data.

00:04:24.882 --> 00:04:28.370
A gentleman named Fair and
a gentleman named Isaac--

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.840
I don't recall
their first names,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.460
I think one was Bill Isaac--

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.570
start this company.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.850
It's a data analytics company.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.290
And by the late 1970s,
it had taken hold.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.530
By the 1980s, it was
the dominant player

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.400
for consumer credit ratings.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.120
And their system is now
used in 32 countries.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.660
And many other companies are
using the FICO score system.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.513
But it's only one system.

00:04:58.513 --> 00:05:00.430
And this gives you a
little bit of background.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.300
It's about what your amounts
that you owe, the payment

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.720
history on those credit cards
and other bank relations.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.460
Are you taking out new credit?

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.000
We could do a whole class
just on FICO scores.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.840
They have updated it
at least eight times.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.800
And in the summer
of 2020, I think

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.990
they're rolling out FICO 9.0.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.880
It's possibly FICO 10.0.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.590
So it's not static, but
it's built in another era.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.790
It's built in an era
about your payment history

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.850
around your bank credit.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.470
It doesn't include
many of the things

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.280
that we would normally
think to include.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.050
And so what is it that
we're going through now?

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.550
We're going through
a period of time

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.383
where folks are saying,
well, wait a minute,

00:05:47.383 --> 00:05:50.740
maybe there are other
ways, alternative ways

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.730
to figure out and
assess your credit.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.440
And it's called
alternative data.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.130
Alternative Data in a sense is
just alternative to whatever

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.320
FICO might be using.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.080
This could be your bank,
checking, employment, income,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.150
insurance, tenant, utilities.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.610
All of this currently
is not in FICO scoring.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.450
Now, in some countries,
employment data and income data

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.130
is already and has been for
decades used for consumer

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.870
credit underwriting.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:22.750
But in the US and up
to 30 other countries

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.870
using the FICO
scores, a lot of this,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.720
even this classic
information like did you

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:33.040
pay your rent on time, did you
pay your utilities on time,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.160
is not necessarily
included in FICO.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.300
It's partly because they didn't
have the data in the 1970s

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.210
when Fair and Isaac
were doing this.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.280
And eight versions
later, they still

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.340
haven't included a lot
of utility and tenancy.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.170
OK, secondly, there's something
called cash flow underwriting.

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.920
And if we go to China and
we go to payment wallets

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.470
around the globe, but let's stay
with China, Alipay and WeChat

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.390
Pay now can really see
a lot of your cash flow,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.530
not just your expenditures,
but your revenues, if you're

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:15.100
moving your income in on some
regular basis into a wallet.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.280
And cash flow underwriting is
even more relevant-- again,

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.580
let's stay with
Alipay for a moment--

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.150
about small and
medium-sized enterprises.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.510
So whether it's Alipay
in China or Toast,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.390
a payment start up in the
restaurant business here

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.860
in the US, Toast can start
to see all the revenues

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:39.790
and expenditures of a restaurant
and sort of make a credit

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.940
decision based upon that.

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.440
So cash flow underwriting
is a very important thing.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.380
You don't necessarily
need machine learning

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.700
or AI to incorporate
this alternative data.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:56.270
But the alternative data is
something that FICO doesn't do.

00:07:56.270 --> 00:08:01.090
And classic banking, doing
small and medium-sized lending,

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:07.070
doesn't necessarily do good
cash flow underwriting.

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.235
Romain any questions?

00:08:10.235 --> 00:08:11.540
TA: None so far on this topic.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.457
We got one question from
Luke that perhaps you

00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:16.070
can touch upon later on
why online banking started

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.440
in Europe versus other regions.

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.440
GARY GENSLER: OK, OK.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:26.070
Let me hold the Luke question
when we get into that as well.

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:27.880
Your consumption,
your purchase data--

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.250
Visa and Mastercard
already are looking at this

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:32.260
to cross-sell to us.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.169
And others are looking
at it to cross-sell.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:39.460
If you're buying sports
equipment or hiking equipment,

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.100
we, all of a sudden,
get advertising for it.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.910
But can alternative
data, like what you buy,

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.110
relate to your credit?

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:49.000
Well, let's talk about
something that's been

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.990
known for some time.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.960
I don't know how
many of you would

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:57.820
have ever, when you went to
replace an automobile tire,

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.740
decide to get it retreaded.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:05.130
Literally, a retread is
putting rubber, new rubber

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.980
on the old tire.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.830
Now, retreads or
something that we

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:13.050
don't usually talk about
in a finance course.

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.420
But it has been
shown that those who

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.370
buy retreads are a little bit
more susceptible to credit

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:25.320
risk, meaning default, meaning
they're a higher risk credit.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.260
What if you could track
people's purchases,

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:33.480
whether it's automobile
retreads versus new tires--

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.000
you see the difference--
or anything else

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.580
that in the purchase
history gives you a sense,

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:41.490
is this a higher risk credit
or a lower risk credit?

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.550
You can take purchase
and consumption data

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:48.870
and tie it to are they
higher insurance risk?

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:52.046
Are they a higher
risk in their credit?

00:09:52.046 --> 00:09:53.830
Now, you have to be careful.

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:59.370
You have to be careful to comply
with local law and societal

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:04.500
norms about not using
alternative data that might be

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.360
suggestive of something else.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.320
It might be suggestive
of cultural differences,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.630
of race or gender
or ethnic background

00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:14.590
or sexual orientation.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.740
And if your consumption
of purchase data

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:20.520
has to do with that and you end
up with something in the US,

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.440
you could easily be
on the wrong side

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.720
of what's called the
Equal Credit Opportunity

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.950
Act, that you have to
basically be fair and unbiased

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.720
in your extension of credit.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.980
And this is sort of
at the cutting ground

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:37.280
of alternative data, is
how does alternative data

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:43.850
get used, but not inadvertently,
or worse, purposely,

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:46.200
trip up fairness
and bias issues.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:50.030
And we saw that recently
with Apple Credit Card.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:55.490
Apple Credit Card rolled
out in the spring of 2019--

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.030
a partnership between
Apple, Goldman Sachs' Marcus

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:02.780
and Mastercard, a
new, innovative thing

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.880
that big tech was
rolling out with big

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.160
find in the spring of 2019.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.550
And all of a sudden,
a venture capitalist

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.490
runs into the Apple
Credit Card and finds

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:17.240
that he and his spouse
were going to get

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.690
10 times different credit.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:21.550
They file tax returns together.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.700
They were together, apparently
worth many millions of dollars,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.370
maybe centimillionaire.

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:31.180
And he starts to
advertise on Twitter

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.120
and promote that the Apple
Credit Card had a problem.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.820
And then Steve Wozniak,
the co-founder of Apple,

00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.120
publicly announces that he
ran into the same problem

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.070
with his wife and himself.

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:44.110
Again, they filed
their taxes together.

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.750
They're both
extraordinarily wealthy.

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.180
Why would one have 10
times or 20 times more

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:50.800
the credit than the other?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.300
There seemed to be,
for whatever reason,

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:57.970
some gender bias in the Apple
Credit allocation alternative

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:59.650
data system.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.870
Now, we don't know yet
to this day what it was.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:06.130
But what we do know is that
Apple Credit Cards stubbed

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:08.710
their toe on their rollout.

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.390
Sometimes it's about the law.

00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:13.180
Sometimes, though,
it's about business.

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:16.270
Sometimes it's about
breaking societal norms.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.600
But in that case, Apple
had a tough rollout.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.340
They roll out Apple Credit Card.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.230
And yet they have
the co-founder,

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:26.380
former founder of Apple
saying not so fast,

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.240
you've got a problem here.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.070
The other sets of data
is our social footprint,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:35.710
our social and media
footprint-- app usage,

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.950
browsing history, the like,
geolocation, et cetera.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.070
And in this world of
coronavirus and the crisis,

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.770
we know that geolocation
is going to be used

00:12:44.770 --> 00:12:48.790
and is already likely being
used for a lot of contact

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:51.880
tracing in many
countries, certainly

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.040
in Korea from the news reports.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:58.070
And I'm guessing Luke could
tell us more about that.

00:12:58.070 --> 00:13:02.990
But we know that
contact tracing and all

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:07.630
of the attributes of figuring
out who we are as an individual

00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:09.610
are being traced more and more.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:13.510
In China, there's a social
credit scoring system

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:18.490
that is an official
part of the government's

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:20.650
approach to extending credit.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.030
It might be whether you
can buy an airline ticket.

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.080
It may be whether you can
even get on the commuter rail

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.320
system, depending
upon your app usage.

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.920
And that app usage in
China even includes, as I

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.260
understand it, not just your--

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.180
what you're doing
on Alipay or WeChat

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.780
Pay, but also what you're
doing on dating websites.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.510
Literally, I repeat
on dating websites,

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:48.520
and whether and how you're
on any website or any app

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.420
could be a little bit
like the tire retreading,

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.510
that you might be--

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.810
you might find, through
the alternative data,

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.100
that it's a little different.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:03.300
Here in the US, many
fintech companies

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.190
are approaching the
regulators and saying

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.100
we don't want to trip up and be
on the wrong side of the Equal

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.540
Credit Opportunity Act.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:11.820
We don't want to be on the
wrong side of other laws,

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:14.730
like Fair Credit Reporting,
Truth in Lending Act,

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:17.160
and a series of other laws.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.590
Please help us,
regulators, interpret

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.220
how we can use alternative
data, how we can actually

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:28.870
be more inclusive, provide
more and better finance

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.440
to more people at a
lower cost, but not

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.250
be on the wrong side of
these important societal

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.060
and legal norms.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.780
So it's a very
interesting place.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:46.240
I'll use one example from a
conversation with Lending Club.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:50.440
I had the honor
to be on a stage--

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.960
before the crisis, one
of the last conferences

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.000
was an MIT fintech conference.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.510
And I was on the stage with
the CEO of Lending Club

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.710
and having a good
interview, a fireside chat.

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.340
And I asked about alternative
data and how they use it.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:07.760
They use it.

00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.650
But what they find is in
using alternative data

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.570
in that marketplace
lending company,

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:18.100
they then use machine learning
on the alternative data.

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.030
They find some what they
believe to be correlations.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:26.530
And then they just use straight
up regression analysis.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:30.850
Once they identify
an attribute, they

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.920
put the machine
learning to the side.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.970
They've used it.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:38.320
But then they sort of then go
to the down-scaled old way,

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:39.760
just straight up.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.560
That's an attribute
we've identified.

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.780
Tire retreads matter.

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:49.060
Let's just use it that way.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:52.360
So they do it by trying
to find some attributes

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.420
and then move on, as I
understood the conversation.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.830
So there's a tremendous
ecosystem in alternative data,

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:00.370
too.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.110
This is just a
slide that pulled.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.680
You can readily get these types
of slides on the internet.

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:09.440
But this is from CB Insights
as to alternative data sources.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:10.720
This is a bunch of companies--

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.390
I wouldn't necessarily
call them fintech startups,

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.640
but they're companies
trying to service,

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.550
here's how we can help
you either with machine

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:21.160
learning, AI, or
actually sources

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.160
of data in this whole space.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.270
So I'm going to move on to the
challenger bank discussion,

00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:30.512
but pause for a moment to
see if there are questions.

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:32.470
I know Luke had a question,
but that was really

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.620
about challenger banks.

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.025
So [Romain?

00:16:35.025 --> 00:16:38.350
TA: Hassan.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.480
AUDIENCE: Hi, yeah.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.250
I mean, if you
could just elaborate

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:44.825
on cash flow underwriting.

00:16:44.825 --> 00:16:47.040
I do not quite get it.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.270
GARY GENSLER: So let's do
it in a small business.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:55.330
And let's use either the
example of toast in the US

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.670
with restaurants or
almost any business

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.580
that Alipay has the wallet.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.599
What Alipay or Toast and
see on that small business

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:07.420
or restaurant is they
can see their revenues

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.304
and they can see their
expenditures to the extent

00:17:10.304 --> 00:17:14.260
that it's kept inside
that payment architecture.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.760
So in Alipay, they've
incentivized the millions

00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.290
of merchants using Alipay
not only to receive revenues

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.280
into their Alipay Wallet, but
also to pay their suppliers

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.470
with the Alipay Wallet.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.620
So what Alipay
can do and does do

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:37.335
is they can start to see the
entire picture or 80% or 90%

00:17:37.335 --> 00:17:37.960
of the picture.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.960
They might not see
the entire picture,

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:47.560
but they can literally build a
whole 360 degrees around them.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.500
Or take something like
Intuit here in the US,

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.390
which is the company
that was founded

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:57.070
20 plus years ago that has
the most dominant sort of tax

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:59.800
software, TurboTax.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.290
Intuit is also in
the fintech space.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.500
They recently announced
buying Credit Karma

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.330
for billions of dollars.

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:10.900
And they also have
other fintech offerings,

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.920
where they can maybe
build a greater picture.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:17.050
I call it cash
flow underwriting.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:19.660
It means underwriting,
assessing the risk,

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.830
because you can see the revenues
and expenditures and build,

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:28.750
in essence, an income
statement on the merchant.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:33.670
Amazon can do some of that, not
completely as well as Alipay.

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:36.790
But Amazon can do some of
that through Amazon Prime

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.700
and what they can
see on the merchant.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:41.190
Did that help?

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:44.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.620
GARY GENSLER: And it gives
them a competitive advantage.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:50.220
And it's part of why getting
into the payment space

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.800
before getting into
the credit space

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.250
is a business model,
particularly in big tech.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:58.290
Now, I'm not saying
that's what was

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.770
the initial reason that Alipay
got into the payment space.

00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:05.100
Alipay was trying to promote
their online platform.

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.470
Amazon got into
the payment space

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.580
to promote their
online platform.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:12.720
And even Toast, the
restaurant software business,

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.760
got into the restaurant
business to sell tablets.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.210
They were thinking we'll
sell the better hardware

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.590
to the restaurateurs,
because this tablet was

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.870
important for the
servers, what we

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:29.520
might call waiters
and waitresses,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.530
walking around a restaurant.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:35.130
But what they quickly
found is that the Toast--

00:19:35.130 --> 00:19:36.420
this is the example--

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.180
they pivoted from being a
hardware tablet business

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:40.560
to being a payment business.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.800
And then they start to be
a credit business as well,

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:47.910
because the data they're
receiving in a partial cash

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:51.630
flow underwriting-- they
don't have a full 360--

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.450
allows them to start to
underwrite in that business.

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:57.570
And frankly, they're likely
to be able to do it better

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:59.310
than a traditional bank.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:01.410
A traditional bank
that might get

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:04.770
annual or quarterly
financials will not

00:20:04.770 --> 00:20:08.880
have quite the up-to-date
sensitivity as to how

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.880
that restaurant's doing.

00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:17.450
TA: And we have a question from
Danielle about data aggregators

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.992
on the slide.

00:20:17.992 --> 00:20:19.200
GARY GENSLER: Please, please.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.080
TA: Are the different
data aggregator players

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.860
for the purposes of selling
to fintech customers

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.120
or for selling to
companies who want

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:29.250
to use the data for
personalized advertising?

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:30.530
And if yes, why?

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:32.983
Do you anticipate
any consolidation?

00:20:32.983 --> 00:20:34.400
GARY GENSLER: No,
I think Danielle

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.810
raised a good question.

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:37.220
They're data aggregators.

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:40.970
And the terms, again, are
not terribly well-defined.

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.450
They're data aggregators
that could be there,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:48.560
as Danielle points out,
to cross-market, to sell.

00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.040
And even-- let's use
Credit Karma for a minute.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:57.020
Credit Karma initially was
about providing free access

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.970
to your credit report.

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.790
That was their initial insight.

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:06.290
What they found over time
is they could cross-sell

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:09.660
and become a friendly
website for free

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.480
to give you access to credit.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.040
They were cross-selling.

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.720
But then they were
also collecting a fee.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.340
And they were
collecting more data.

00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:23.140
And inevitably, they had
100 plus million files,

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.590
even though they had
much fewer customers.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:30.100
But data aggregation could
also come from another space.

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.240
Plaid, Galileo, and
others, we call them also

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.350
data aggregators.

00:21:35.350 --> 00:21:38.920
And they started as
software providers

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:42.190
to provide an open
API, as we discussed.

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.430
But then they create
a data warehouse.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.080
And they become
data aggregators.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:51.170
So the term data aggregator
can be used in many ways.

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.490
One small way it can be used
is the second way Danielle

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.080
mentioned, and it's kind
of mentioned on this slide

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.480
of alternative data.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.440
There's some companies that
just said we will collect data.

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:06.050
FICO score doesn't
have utility data.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:09.530
We'll collect the utility
data and rental payment data.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:14.120
We believe it will become an
alternative data aggregator.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.040
So yes, they're are
data aggregator.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.000
But they're collecting
data with the clear mind

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.630
that they're going to
enhance credit scoring.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:25.670
And as we turn now
to challenger banks,

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:27.420
challenger banks
might say, look,

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:31.010
we don't have the
ability in our first year

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:33.530
or even maybe 10
years of business

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.680
to be the one collecting all
that utility and rent payment

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.750
or social media data.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.760
We want to turn
to somebody else.

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.770
You might create
a business simply

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:45.680
to say we are going to
be a data aggregator

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.120
to enhance the underwriting
of these banks.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.190
There's hundreds of
challenger banks.

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.340
I want to be a service provider
to those challenger banks.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:56.690
So Danielle, good question.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.195
It could be on marketing.

00:22:58.195 --> 00:22:59.570
It could be that
you've got there

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.020
because you were in the business
of something else, payments

00:23:03.020 --> 00:23:05.780
or credit scoring,
like Credit Karma.

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.000
Or you could
specifically say I just

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.630
want to have a
business model simply

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.690
about an alternative
data field that I think

00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:17.600
and my machine
learning might tell me

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.490
that alternative
data field is going

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.050
to give us better underwriting.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:23.570
And then I will sell to
all the other fintechs.

00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:25.760
I will service fintechs
by collecting data.

00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:31.105
Romain anything else, or--

00:23:31.105 --> 00:23:33.366
TA: We have Nikhil and
Brian with their hands up.

00:23:33.366 --> 00:23:34.116
Go ahead, you two.

00:23:34.116 --> 00:23:36.491
GARY GENSLER: OK, Nikhil or
Brian and then we'll move on.

00:23:36.491 --> 00:23:38.740
AUDIENCE: I had a question
around underwriting

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.220
based on cash flows.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.490
So I wrote my paper
on alternative data.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:44.470
And something that
came out was most

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.230
of the alternative
data lending firms are

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.620
focused on small businesses.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:53.710
So the Amazon example that you
gave is for their suppliers.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:55.510
Is there regulation
in the US that's

00:23:55.510 --> 00:24:00.160
preventing a cash-flow-based
underwriting for customers?

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:04.470
Because countries like
Kenya have it with M-Shwari.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:07.480
Baidu piloted
something with Zest AI.

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.690
So just curious, what's limiting
cash-flow-based underwriting

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.700
in the US specifically?

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.750
GARY GENSLER: I think
it's a great question.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:18.220
I think it's not
just regulatory.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:25.600
It's also that as
of now, as of now,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.020
the folks they could probably
do the best cash flow

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:34.060
underwriting on us are
the banks themselves,

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:39.790
that Bank of America and Citi
sees your rent payment going

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:42.130
out, sees your Visa
payments going out,

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:45.070
and sees your wages coming in.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:49.370
I mean, literally
the banks themselves.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.870
And yet, they have not,
as I understand it,

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:58.360
yet done a full 360
cash-flow underwriting.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.570
A number of them are enhancing
their credit card products

00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:04.810
and enhancing those products by
taking the FICO scores and then

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.390
sort of like FICO plus a little.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:10.300
But interestingly, the big
banks have collected together

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.700
and formed something
called Vantage,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.620
which is a competitor to FICO.

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:19.000
And it's a sort of consortium
amongst some big banks.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.690
But it doesn't fully
include the income side.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:26.410
And I think it does relate to
some of the regulatory issues

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.120
here in the US.

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:32.080
In the earlier wave, in the
earlier wave of data analytics

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.580
in the 1960s--

00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:36.910
remember, credit cards came
along in the '50s and '60s--

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.610
we passed two really
important laws--

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:43.120
one about bias, called Equal
Credit Opportunity Act,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.080
and one about credit
reporting agencies.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.260
These companies like
TransUnion and Equifax,

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:53.680
they're regulated under the
Fair Credit Reporting Act.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:57.340
And a lot of banks,
they're just sort of

00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.890
trying to work
through those issues.

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:02.620
And again, this sets up the
challenger bank discussion.

00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:06.020
It's part of why challenger
banks around the globe--

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.960
they started more in Europe--

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.920
but the challenger banks around
the globe had an alternative.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.900
This is one of the
reasons I think that they

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.240
have a bit of an alternative.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.920
I think this is
where we're headed.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:24.980
We will, as individuals,
be more looked at this way.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.320
One little story-- there
was one other question,

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.165
Romain I'm sorry, who was it?

00:26:29.165 --> 00:26:30.205
TA: Brian.

00:26:30.205 --> 00:26:32.170
GARY GENSLER: Brian and
then one little story

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:34.722
close out alternative data.

00:26:34.722 --> 00:26:36.430
AUDIENCE: Could you
please talk about how

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:40.450
legislation, such as GDPR and
other similar legislation,

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.397
has affected this space?

00:26:42.397 --> 00:26:43.730
GARY GENSLER: So great question.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:48.670
There's also privacy concerns
about sharing my data.

00:26:48.670 --> 00:26:50.050
Now, we all share our data.

00:26:50.050 --> 00:26:53.230
That sort of horse
is out of that barn.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:55.660
But then society
sort of says wait,

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.540
what's your protection here?

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:05.170
You're at the forefront of this,
passes the GDPR, the General

00:27:05.170 --> 00:27:08.320
Directive, and the
P is not privacy.

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.940
I'm sorry, I can't
remember the--

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.335
AUDIENCE: Protection something.

00:27:11.335 --> 00:27:13.840
GARY GENSLER: Protection
Regulation, data-- data

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.990
protection, that's right,
General Data Protection

00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.280
Regulation.

00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:22.730
And they passed GDPR, basically
the right to be forgotten,

00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:24.820
the rights about your
information, the right

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:28.210
to basically review
it and so forth.

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:31.750
It has some similarities
to those laws that

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:37.000
were way back in the 1970s
called Fair Credit Reporting

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.090
Act, even, but a lot further.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.420
And what these privacy laws,
and more recently in the US,

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:48.010
the California Consumer
Protection Act or CCPA--

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:52.030
we all got notices in 2019
and regarding from Google

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.550
and others about the CCPA.

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:58.510
What they've done is they've
leaned into an ability for you

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.960
to review your data and
potentially edit your data

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.780
and delete some of
what's being tracked.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:10.330
It does raise some of
the R data protection--

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:14.770
General Data
Protection Regulation.

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:20.080
But it doesn't go to the heart
of whether using the data

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.980
is going to lead to
biased outcomes, which

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.550
is about fairness
and equal credit,

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:31.570
or whether you're going to be
regulated like a credit agency.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:37.670
So I think the GDPR and CCPA
better protect the public.

00:28:37.670 --> 00:28:41.380
They also raise some of
the costs and barriers

00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:42.920
to entry in this field.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.370
So there's some economics to it.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:49.630
I think they might also tend
a little bit towards then

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:53.470
homogeneic outcomes, meaning
that all the banks will

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.380
be doing similar things
to protect themselves

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.450
in the regulatory environment.

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:01.190
So I think it's a consideration.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.490
It doesn't necessarily
slow this down.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.190
It's also an opportunity
for a fintech startup.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:10.780
If you think you can
be GDPR-CCPA compliant

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:15.160
and still be a really talented
alternative data aggregator,

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.290
that's an opportunity for you.

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:20.650
If you're ahead of the
regulatory curve and lower

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.680
regulatory risk for
the other startups,

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.840
so that's an opportunity.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.820
One little comment
on alternative data

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:30.420
that I like to mention--

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.890
and I don't remember where
I read this, so I apologize.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.850
I can't quote this--
the study accurately.

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:42.740
But there has been
a study about credit

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.190
as it relates to
charging your phones.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.460
And so I just pass
this along to you,

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:53.510
that if some alternative data
provider and alternative data

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:58.310
underwriter wants to
assess whether you or I are

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:04.170
good credit, apparently, if one
charges your phone every night,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:08.952
we're more likely to repay our
credit card and personal loans.

00:30:08.952 --> 00:30:10.910
And if you don't charge
your phone every night,

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:13.100
that's fine with me.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.120
That's totally fine.

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:19.990
But apparently, you're a little
bit higher risk for credit.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.110
That's what one
survey has shown.

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:24.013
And I apologize.

00:30:24.013 --> 00:30:25.930
I just don't even remember
all the things I've

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:27.790
read, where I've breaded this.

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:34.290
And so what if some
challenger bank just tracks

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.300
whether you charge your phone?

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.550
By the way, that's
not hard to do.

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.210
It's easy.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:43.820
These phones are really
quite sophisticated--

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.620
geolocation, tracking,
contact tracing, everything.

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.220
So let's talk about the
readings and everything.

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.570
I'm not going to dive into it.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:53.835
But there were three readings
about challenger banks,

00:30:53.835 --> 00:30:59.130
neobanks, and some of the
challenges going forward

00:30:59.130 --> 00:30:59.910
in this field.

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.860
What is a challenger
bank or neobank?

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:06.807
And since we're--

00:31:06.807 --> 00:31:08.140
I don't want to run out of time.

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:12.630
Let me just sort of say
challenger and neobank are

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:17.320
often used interchangeably,
but they're actually--

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:21.106
to the more sort of specific,
they're a little bit different.

00:31:21.106 --> 00:31:24.650
A neobank is something
that is acting like a bank

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:28.490
but is not yet
registered or licensed

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:30.620
as a bank in its jurisdiction.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.890
And a challenger
bank more technically

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:35.990
would be something
that has a license.

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.860
Now, most people use these
terms interchangeably.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.380
But there's slight differences.

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.910
Do they have yet registered?

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.890
And challenger
banks and neobanks

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:48.560
are used to talk
about this thing that

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:52.550
happened in these last
seven to ten years.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.130
I'm going in a little
bit talk about how

00:31:55.130 --> 00:32:00.050
this relates to the online
banking that came before it.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.130
The pain points in
traditional banking--

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.950
we're going to dive into this
in a minute in a few slides.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.360
So I'll hold off.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.850
But those pain points about the
costs that the big banks have,

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.760
the bricks and mortar legacy
business that they have,

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.030
the legacy technology
are real and they've

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:20.630
provided some opportunity
to challenger banks.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.930
And the question is how will
challenger banks and neobanks

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:25.470
affect the landscape?

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:28.740
So one is what is
this phenomena?

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.850
Two, why have they been
able to tap into this?

00:32:31.850 --> 00:32:34.190
What's the traditional
bank's problems?

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:36.020
And three, what's it
mean for the future?

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:39.750
That's what we're going to
try to cover going forward.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.390
So the challenges--

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:45.080
I mentioned a couple of them,
but look, we all know it.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.790
In the US, there's about 78,000
branches still in the US.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:52.520
That's down from about
82,000 or 83,000.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.520
What will that number
be in 10 years?

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.620
It's not declining
leaps and bounds.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:00.380
But particularly after
the coronavirus crisis,

00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:03.120
whenever we get to the
other side of this,

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:09.530
whether it optimistically is in
months or more, realistically,

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.100
in a couple of years and we--
all this social distancing

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.860
starts to move
around and we start

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:21.440
to get out there, this 78,000
branches, do we need them all?

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.380
And yet surveys of the
public, still people

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.250
like to have a physical branch
for that occasional time you

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.920
go into a physical branch.

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.400
They have legacy technology.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.480
The products themselves
are somewhat commoditized.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.750
A mortgages a mortgage, by
and large, an auto loan,

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:40.250
and even a small business loan.

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.260
There's a certain
commoditization

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.200
of payments and credit.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:49.880
And how, when you still have
4,000 to 5,000 banks in the US

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.070
and in many countries
still hundreds of banks,

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:54.770
how do they literally
compete with each other

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:58.970
on a product that is
somewhat commoditized?

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:01.220
Now, you might say that's
hard for the new competitor.

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.137
But the new competitor
then comes in and says,

00:34:03.137 --> 00:34:06.410
well, maybe I can only provide
something to the restaurant

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:09.170
business, or I can provide
something that is really

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:11.360
a great user interface.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:15.290
And the cost and
fees are real, too.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.600
The traditional
banking, not just

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.929
because of their branch network
of nearly 80,000 branches

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:24.800
in the US, but also because
of their employment,

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.080
also because of their fees--

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:30.120
a lot of the challenger banks
broke in by saying, listen,

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:32.780
we're not going to charge
you the same overdraft fees

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:34.250
or late fees.

00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:38.989
And if you do a deep dive and
a deep study on one consumer

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:42.830
banking, a lot of the
revenue is on fees,

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.770
whether it's overdraft,
late fees and the like.

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:50.659
And so challenger banks
also said we can go in there

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:54.540
and try to challenge online in
a different way and, of course,

00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:56.909
provide greater user interface.

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:58.910
I think, to Luke's
earlier question,

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:02.540
partly why challenger
banks started in Europe

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.470
was partly because of the
Payment System directive.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:09.530
There was first PDS,
Payment System Directive,

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.890
what's now called 1 and PSD 2.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:14.900
I think it's partly
because of the Payment

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:19.370
System directives, but
partly the 2008 crisis.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:23.600
Now, Ally Bank here
in the US technically

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.030
was the first one in 2009 here.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:29.300
But a lot of people don't
say that was the first one.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.290
But that came after the crisis.

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:33.080
And then you saw
this spur of them

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:36.770
in the early teens
that came along.

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:39.290
And I think a lot of it
had to do with trust.

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:41.480
And the European situation
it was going through,

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:46.670
the European debt crisis, all
the way through 2012, 2013.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:49.850
And you saw an enormous
number of these starting

00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:53.720
between 2011 and 2015.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.730
And so this is a little bit
the history of online banking.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:01.640
And I take this from
FT Partners, which

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.500
is Financial Technology
Partners, which

00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:09.140
is a small investment bank
started by a former Wall Street

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:11.240
banker, I think a
handful from Goldman

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:13.610
and maybe Morgan
Stanley and the others.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.920
But we're not going to
go through each of these.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.930
But the Bank of
Scotland actually

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:21.710
started to do online
banking back in 1983.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:27.350
In essence, anything you think
is new has something way back.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:30.630
Bank of America was
already online by 2001.

00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:34.010
Yodlee, which is-- we talked
about Yodlee when we talked

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.750
about APIs--

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.540
had already been
in this business.

00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.570
And ING, which was part of
a big insurance company,

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:43.700
started retail banking
in the late '90s.

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.110
The internet came along.

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:47.450
An earlier wave of
fintech developed

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:50.060
and online banking came along.

00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:54.620
Most of it, most of it
related to traditional banks.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:59.840
And the distinction that I
draw between online banking

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.390
and challenger banking--

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:05.660
it's a light distinction, but an
important one-- online banking

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.720
generally was
related to companies

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.570
that had bricks and mortars,
traditional business models,

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:15.200
generally-- not
always, not always.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:20.540
And Mint was launched in 2006,
later acquired by Intuit.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.510
That tax software
company acquired Mint.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:27.320
ING, an insurance company,
has something that Capital One

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.320
buys for $9 billion in 2011.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:36.490
So the earlier wave of
non-banking online banking,

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:40.310
non-traditional banking,
like ING Direct and Mint,

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.290
were acquired.

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:44.570
They were eaten up, taken up.

00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:48.170
And Ally-- Ally was an
auto lending company

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.930
formed 100 years ago
by General Motors.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:55.370
It was the first captive
auto lending company.

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.430
But this set this
stage to what if I just

00:37:58.430 --> 00:38:01.640
started something that
never had a banking license,

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.770
never had a bricks and mortar?

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.750
It's just a start up.

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:09.200
I'm just going to go into
some of these cracks,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:11.810
some of these opportunities
the traditional banks

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.900
are giving me-- costs, fees,
trust, user interface--

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:16.770
and I'm going to
start something.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.800
And so what are the reasons?

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.870
And from a survey,
from a different group,

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:23.670
The Financial Brand,
these are just

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:25.740
some of the reasons
people are saying.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.080
It's easy to set up an account.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.600
I like the fees and the rates.

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.960
Better experience,
quality service, in one

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:37.270
survey a couple of months ago.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.000
That's an opportunity as well.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.520
Here's a list.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.270
You can make the
list so much longer.

00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:45.720
There's hundreds
of other companies.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.370
But what I tried
to do in this is

00:38:47.370 --> 00:38:51.360
sort of stick to around
the world different banks.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.540
Ally Bank from 11
years ago, but look

00:38:54.540 --> 00:39:00.420
at the spate of startups
in 2013 to 2016 or '16.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:04.990
Now, some of these are
new, like BigPay in India.

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:09.300
Some of them are multi-billion
valuation companies already,

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.440
like Nubank in Brazil,
started about seven years ago.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.460
There's a bulk of them
from the UK, like OakNorth.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.000
Now, Revolut is in
30 countries now,

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.820
one of the earliest and
largest out of Europe.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.380
Some are coming from
other fintech space.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.800
Like SoFi didn't start as what
people would traditionally

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.140
call a challenger bank.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:38.110
SoFi kind of started as an
online lending platform,

00:39:38.110 --> 00:39:40.120
not quite peer to peer.

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.400
But then SoFi is moving over.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.130
You can put on this
list Betterment

00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:47.350
that we will talk about
in the next lecture that

00:39:47.350 --> 00:39:49.480
does wealth management.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.870
Betterment is starting
to move into this space.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:57.400
Plaid has started to say they
will move into this space.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.440
And then WeBank is
an interesting one

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.080
that's really formed by a
bunch of commercial banks

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:06.580
in China that's saying
we're going to just have

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.890
an online platform.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.440
Is it really part of those
commercial banks or is it

00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.680
separately a challenger bank.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.740
So I've got a lot going
on, and KakaoBank,

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.320
which is started by one
of the big tech firms.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:24.080
I chose not to put
Ant Financial on here.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.720
But you could arguably say
Ant Financial, part of Alipay.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.740
I was trying to stick to things
that are really classically

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.960
called challenger neobanks.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.280
So the vocabulary
is a little loose.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:38.950
Most people, when they think
of challenger neobanks,

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.930
they think of Revolut in Europe.

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:43.090
If you want to study
a case closely,

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:47.390
look at Revolut,
now in 30 countries.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:51.200
But a lot of other players
who try to get in--

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:53.320
TransferWise from
the payment space.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.360
So some from the payment
space some, from the big tech,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.290
like KakaoBank, some
from commercial banks,

00:41:00.290 --> 00:41:03.200
some from investment banks, like
Goldman Sachs starts Marcus.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.240
A lot going on.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.620
Nearly every country--

00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:13.490
Australia is represented
here, China, Southeast Asia

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.160
and the like.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:18.320
But this sort of
gives you a map of it,

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:20.870
back to that FT Partners thing.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:24.830
This blows it up even more,
just with their logos.

00:41:24.830 --> 00:41:28.610
But you can see it's really
around the globe right now.

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.943
Kind of was emanated out of
Europe, populated out of the US

00:41:32.943 --> 00:41:34.610
then, and then all
of a sudden, you just

00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.370
saw it kind of all
around the globe.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:41.120
Brazil, enormous contributions
out of Brazil in the business

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.560
models as well and the like.

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:53.440
Paytm out of India as well, in a
sense, I should have mentioned.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.240
Quite a sort of
interesting-- and this

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.130
will be up in Canvas, of course.

00:41:57.130 --> 00:41:58.935
So what are their
product offerings?

00:41:58.935 --> 00:42:00.310
What are their
product offerings?

00:42:00.310 --> 00:42:03.670
Well, any bank has the same sort
of list of product offerings,

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:04.570
of course.

00:42:04.570 --> 00:42:08.200
And this is just one example,
again, from this FT Partners.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.660
Checking and savings--
to be a challenger bank,

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.210
it's usually right
there, somewhere in debit

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:16.070
cards, credit cards,
checking, savings.

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:19.990
And basically, they would say
it was easy to an account.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:21.970
And we will actually
pay you something.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:25.270
Revolut, interestingly, started
in the cross-border payment

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:28.725
area and basically said
you could have an account--

00:42:28.725 --> 00:42:30.100
you can be in one
country and you

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.660
could have an account
in multiple currencies.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:38.250
Traditional banking is a
single-currency product, partly

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:41.080
regulation, partly history.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.630
But Revolut says we're online.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:44.670
You can have
multiple currencies.

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:49.270
And we won't charge you all
of that cross-border cost.

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.250
One might say it started
as a payment company.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:55.790
But it was really an offering
you accounts as well.

00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:57.580
And this idea of
offering an account--

00:42:57.580 --> 00:43:00.160
remember, the term neobank
and challenger bank,

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:02.770
often used interchangeably,
but neobank is something

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.050
that's not yet licensed.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.290
You've seen a spate of companies
in the United Kingdom getting

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.660
licensed from 2016 to 2019.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:13.900
Many that were not licensed
as traditional banks

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.330
then filed for their
banking licenses.

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.870
And you've seen that
happening along the way.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:23.350
When will SoFi, for instance,
get their banking license

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:24.880
in the US, so to speak.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.100
You'll see that sort of
going along the way as well.

00:43:32.450 --> 00:43:35.230
Romain I'm just going to pause
for questions just to see--

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:37.160
get a little engaged here.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:40.250
And then I'm going to go
to their account base.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.920
And we're going to talk
about their account base.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:46.220
And then we'll turn to funding,
valuations, and a little bit

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.945
how traditional
banks are reacting.

00:43:48.945 --> 00:43:49.810
TA: Excellent.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:51.227
Alessandro, do you want to go?

00:43:51.227 --> 00:43:52.310
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:43:52.310 --> 00:43:53.360
Hi, Gary.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.000
So my question is many
of these companies

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.410
that offer credit cards, they
often partner up with banks.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:03.740
Is this because of regulatory
issues or a balance

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:05.110
sheet issues?

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:06.610
GARY GENSLER: It's
a great question.

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:07.670
It's really both.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.700
And it's not just--

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.580
it's not just in the
credit card business.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:16.340
You found that
marketplace lenders also

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:19.040
partnered up with banks.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:24.650
The idea of entering
part of finance--

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.650
you always have a decision
in any business of buy

00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:31.190
versus build or
rent versus bill.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.960
You can do this with
your cloud storage.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.990
Do I want to build my
data warehouse or rent it?

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:38.210
Well, by and large, if
you're a fintech startup,

00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:40.460
you're going to rent your
cloud storage now, right?

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:42.650
You're not going to build
your data warehouse.

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:47.360
You might similarly rent
somebody else's balance sheet.

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.200
And so part of what you've
seen is about balance sheet.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.110
You start a business and you
try to find some funding,

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:56.900
but you don't have
the funding yourself.

00:44:56.900 --> 00:44:58.620
You don't have a balance sheet.

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.460
And you can get a
warehouse line of credit.

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.160
And you can use the asset
securitization market

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:08.540
as well to offload those credit
card receivables, those auto

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:10.490
receivables, student
loan, and, of course,

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:12.380
mortgage receivables.

00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.522
And-- excuse me--

00:45:14.522 --> 00:45:19.390
[SNEEZES] and so you see
[SNEEZES] in some lines

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:21.550
of business,
particularly mortgages,

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.640
that what one might call
alternative finance--

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.250
Quicken Loans,
PennyMac, and others

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.800
have built very
significant-- well

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:34.660
over 50% of mortgages in
the US now, 50% to 60%,

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:39.970
originated by the non-banks
because they can readily

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:42.490
offload the balance
sheet issues.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:45.760
But to your question, a lot
of it is also regulatory.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:50.080
And in the credit card space
and in the peer-to-peer lending

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:53.350
space, without a
bank license, it's

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:56.920
hard to do all the
pieces you need to do.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.340
And without kind of diving into
each of the regulatory reasons

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.990
why, you tend to--

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:05.223
so Amazon partnered with
Synchrony, for instance.

00:46:05.223 --> 00:46:06.640
And subsequent,
it looks like they

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:11.890
may have also partnered with
JPMorgan Chase on credit card

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:12.670
offerings.

00:46:12.670 --> 00:46:14.830
And there are banks, like
Synchrony and others,

00:46:14.830 --> 00:46:18.430
they will say we'll
basically white label.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.460
Some of them, like
Synchrony, that's a co-brand,

00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:21.940
on Amazon-Synchrony.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.960
Some will say we'll just
be in the background.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:27.640
And there are actually
some licensed banks

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.300
that make a business out of
servicing fintech companies.

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:35.200
And there's a whole
group of licensed banks

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.860
that in both Europe
and the US feel

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:42.800
that's a line of business
in and of itself.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.815
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:43.815 --> 00:46:45.405
TA: Martin.

00:46:45.405 --> 00:46:47.580
AUDIENCE: Yes,
with so many banks

00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.600
and with so many similar
credit offerings,

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:54.130
how do you see the
differentiation will happen?

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:54.680
And there--

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.888
GARY GENSLER: Great question.

00:46:55.888 --> 00:46:58.470
Look, this is a
very exciting space,

00:46:58.470 --> 00:47:00.150
but it's going to shake out.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:07.860
I mean, it's hard to imagine
that they'll all be there.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.470
There is one website--

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:12.890
I didn't choose to put it up
here-- that actually follows

00:47:12.890 --> 00:47:17.690
the top 10 challenger
banks, by every six months,

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:21.880
they post who is getting
the most web traffic?

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:26.320
And part of it-- if you're
SoFi, and in one year

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:29.680
you get the most web traffic,
but three years later, people

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.740
aren't going on your
website, that's a problem.

00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.780
I'm not saying SoFi
yet has that problem.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:40.930
So the way that these
companies-- they've each

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:42.230
started a little different.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:44.380
Some start in a
slice of a domain,

00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:46.570
like Revolt is the cross-border.

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:50.290
Some come at it from
the open API side.

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:52.810
Some come from
the low-cost side.

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:57.970
They find one pain point and
they try to do that well.

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:01.540
All of them that are successful
now pretty much started

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.402
between 2013 and 2018.

00:48:03.402 --> 00:48:05.110
So it's a little harder
to think somebody

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:06.490
is going to get in now.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:09.100
But it might be a geography.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:14.120
It might be like BigPay, which
I think is in Southeast Asia.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:17.630
It might be a geography as well.

00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:19.270
But I do think
there's going to be--

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:20.710
there's going to be shakeout.

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:24.010
And even amongst
the unicorns, those

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:27.610
that are valued over $1
billion, customers matter.

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:29.170
And maybe this sets up.

00:48:29.170 --> 00:48:31.750
I'm going to show
you two competing

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.280
charts on challenger banks.

00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.320
This is just Europe.

00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.910
This is just Europe.

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:39.700
But you see the
growth in customers--

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:44.170
Revolt, N26, Monese
and so forth,

00:48:44.170 --> 00:48:47.410
just this remarkable
growth of customers.

00:48:47.410 --> 00:48:51.010
That's getting noted
by traditional banks.

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:56.230
You get 5, 10 million
customer accounts, that's

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:58.640
a remarkable thing to happen.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:00.760
We'll talk more about
this when we do asset

00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:02.980
management in the next lecture.

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:08.050
But most of the biggest online
brokers, to give you scaling,

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.890
were somewhere between 6 and
12 million customer accounts,

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:19.330
E-Trade and the like,
TD Ameritrade, so forth.

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.830
So to give this on a scale
of customer accounts,

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.290
these started to
really get noticed.

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:27.420
And another customer
account chart--

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:31.200
different service, it's hard to
know whether these numbers are

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.440
accurate, but these are
self-reported by the companies.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.980
This is by year of crop,
the 2013 startups--

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:42.420
Nubank, Aspiration,
Tandem, Chime.

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.580
Well, Nubank getting to 15
million customer accounts

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.960
or KakaoBank in Korea getting
to 10 million customers,

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:54.240
Chime, 6 million, 5 million
for MoneyLion, Revolut, 6,

00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:56.400
and some other figures
show Revolut might

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.990
be closer to 9 million now--

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:03.980
these are significant
in and of themselves,

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:05.100
that they can get to that.

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:07.930
So part of a business model--

00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:09.980
you can see hundreds
of challenger banks.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:15.720
But many of them still only have
100,000 to 400,000 accounts.

00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:17.490
And that's a great
start, but you've

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:20.560
got to kind of get further.

00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.440
And the venture
capitalists behind it

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.900
have to decide what's
their exit strategy?

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.820
Can you sell this to
somebody else who's

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.890
trying to get a foothold
in this space or not?

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:32.640
Stash, by the way,
that's listed here

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:36.660
is more in the online
brokerage business than it

00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:38.050
on an online banking.

00:50:38.050 --> 00:50:41.170
So I chose not to
list it earlier.

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:44.730
Tandem, only half a
million customers,

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:47.010
is a really big one in the UK.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:51.540
But Starling Bank and
Revolut and Monzo are bigger.

00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.940
So how does Tandem
break through when

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:58.050
you've got four or five that
are bigger, just as an example,

00:50:58.050 --> 00:51:00.320
in the UK?

00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:03.300
And so then valuations--

00:51:03.300 --> 00:51:05.980
and it's really hard to
get behind valuations.

00:51:05.980 --> 00:51:10.237
All of this is before
the corona crisis.

00:51:10.237 --> 00:51:11.820
Some of these are
going to be winners.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:16.050
Some of them are going to
be losers, this one taken

00:51:16.050 --> 00:51:19.620
from a Forbes article
in late 2019 based

00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:24.140
on PitchBook Data from
their last funding round.

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.600
Now, Nubank-- look,
let's go back.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:30.680
Nubank, 15 or so
million customers--

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:34.010
Nubank's been the big
success story here.

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.460
Revolut, if that's a true number
from their last funding round,

00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:43.750
that seems a little out of
what the customer numbers are.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.700
It might be an
out-of-date figure.

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.930
Valuations aren't clear.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:49.860
This is not stock
market valuation.

00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:52.760
So I'm going to give you
another take on this as well,

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.980
is this is the actual funding--

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:57.530
back to the FT Partners survey--

00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:01.070
this is actual funding that
these companies have done

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:05.200
and then what they call
pre-money valuations of Nubank

00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.350
and Chime and some
of the others.

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:11.690
So these are not insignificant
players in the market.

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:14.480
If you're thinking about going
to work for one of these,

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.090
it would be an
exciting career path.

00:52:17.090 --> 00:52:21.200
But even the Nubanks
and Chimes and N26s

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:25.490
have to figure out how they stay
viable, how they stay vibrant

00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:32.338
against the traditional players
and the big tech companies.

00:52:32.338 --> 00:52:34.130
And if you're all the
way at the other end,

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:35.780
if you're a company like Dave--

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:39.140
Dave is thought of as
just maybe a unicorn

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.750
and it's only raised 76 million.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:44.600
Now, that number
may or may not--

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.920
but if you're Dave and you're
there with a couple employees,

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.020
will it be there in
three years or not?

00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.528
What's their exit strategy?

00:52:52.528 --> 00:52:54.320
So I think you've raised
the right question

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.970
about all of these.

00:52:56.970 --> 00:53:02.690
And the history of banking is we
don't-- we do have 5,000 6,000

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:03.680
or so in the US.

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.510
But they're community banks.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:09.660
They locally serve and really
work hard in their communities.

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:11.240
They know their
business community.

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:11.900
They know that.

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:13.820
And they have some
bricks and mortars.

00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:18.130
In an online space, we know
that network effects matter.

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:21.700
And with network effects online,
how many of these will exist

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:23.920
is a great question.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.350
Romain one more
slide on funding,

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.980
but questions is I thought
this was kind of interesting.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:32.760
I don't necessarily
subscribe to it.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.810
But they-- this one site
sort of said let's take

00:53:35.810 --> 00:53:38.240
a look at the funding numbers.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:43.010
What are their funding
numbers and how many customers

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:44.070
they have?

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:48.600
So if you take what their last
valuation number is divided

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:51.510
by their customers, and they
come up with this concept,

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:55.510
that customers are
worth about $730 apiece,

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:59.190
if you just average everything,
you divide their valuation

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:02.680
by their customer count.

00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.600
It doesn't work perfectly.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:05.600
It absolutely doesn't.

00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:10.890
But you can get a sense of this
is about an account aggregation

00:54:10.890 --> 00:54:12.060
model.

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:14.770
Can you build accounts,
get to a million?

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:18.360
Can you get to 5 or 10
million and actually service

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:18.900
and provide?

00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.210
So what's happening is
a lot of these companies

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.340
are negative funding.

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:25.980
By negative funding,
what they're really doing

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:31.220
is they're offering
products to the public,

00:54:31.220 --> 00:54:34.100
but they're not covering
all of their costs.

00:54:34.100 --> 00:54:38.420
They might be offering
interest rates on the deposits.

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:45.620
They might be having lower
costs and fees, lower late fees

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.660
and account maintenance fees.

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.370
They might not have
account maintenance.

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:52.640
A lot of these will allow you to
have in essence micro payments

00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.440
and micro accounts.

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:57.140
But how they're funding that
is the venture capitalists

00:54:57.140 --> 00:55:00.020
are funding it, basically,
because what they're trying

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:02.630
to do is build valuation.

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:06.830
Their whole model is about
building value and then

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:12.470
exiting somehow and judging
when to do that exit.

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:16.970
Now, some of them will
get to be income positive.

00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:21.560
But those that right now aren't
in the corona environment,

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:25.670
coronavirus crisis we're
in, there's a new term

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:29.540
that you'll hear amongst
venture capitalists, is runway.

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.960
How much runway
does a company have?

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:37.070
Did its last funding round,
did they raise enough money

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:42.710
to sustain them for six
months more or two years more?

00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:45.650
And a lot relates to one was
their last funding round?

00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:48.080
If their last funding round
was in the last six months

00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:51.345
and they have enough
runway, enough cash

00:55:51.345 --> 00:55:56.210
so that their cash burn, they
can last two or three years,

00:55:56.210 --> 00:56:00.412
that's more optimistic than
if their runway is six months

00:56:00.412 --> 00:56:02.120
and they haven't done
their last funding.

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:04.560
It's been a year ago.

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.060
They did their A round, but
they haven't done their B round.

00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:10.240
And they've done their C round,
haven't done their D round.

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.370
And, in essence,
they have to-- a lot

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:14.830
of these companies in the
middle of the coronavirus crisis

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:20.710
have to figure out how
to extend their runway,

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:23.260
maybe do a suboptimal
new funding

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:27.520
round that doesn't
boost their valuation,

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:30.920
merge or consolidate.

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:34.340
So it's also a challenging
time, depending upon what

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.990
they hadn't anticipated--

00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:37.670
quote, how much
runway they have,

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:40.350
when was their last
funding round and the like,

00:56:40.350 --> 00:56:44.340
and have they gone
cash-flow positive?

00:56:44.340 --> 00:56:46.220
Most of these have
not necessarily

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:48.635
gone cash-flow positive.

00:56:48.635 --> 00:56:50.510
Romain I'll pause for
questions, and then I'm

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:53.287
going to talk about
traditional banks.

00:56:53.287 --> 00:56:54.620
TA: So you almost just answered.

00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.450
We had a question
from Alida in the chat

00:56:56.450 --> 00:57:00.238
asking whether this
model is profitable.

00:57:00.238 --> 00:57:03.850
GARY GENSLER: Alida it is
profitable in terms of selling

00:57:03.850 --> 00:57:06.670
equity to venture capitalists.

00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:09.100
It is profitable for
some of the banks that

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:14.030
have been sold even earlier
times to traditional banks.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:19.800
And for some on bottom line has
crossed over and is profitable.

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:23.490
But we don't have financials
for the hundreds of challenger

00:57:23.490 --> 00:57:24.660
and neobanks.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:29.790
But by and large, most,
before the coronavirus crisis,

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:33.680
would have been in a
negative earnings space.

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:36.180
And what they were trying
to do is basically build

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:39.870
digital footprint,
build customer base

00:57:39.870 --> 00:57:41.610
to get to that
first half million,

00:57:41.610 --> 00:57:43.110
to get to that first
million, to get

00:57:43.110 --> 00:57:45.410
to the 5 and 10 million round.

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:49.290
You get 5 or 10 million
customers, what you've built

00:57:49.290 --> 00:57:52.050
is you've built a valuable
thing that somebody else might

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:53.700
want to buy.

00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:56.310
And you've tended-- you've
tended to then to get

00:57:56.310 --> 00:57:57.840
to cash-flow positive by then.

00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:59.830
But I don't have the financials.

00:57:59.830 --> 00:58:01.770
I wouldn't be able
to tell you which

00:58:01.770 --> 00:58:07.140
ones of these small players
are yet cash-flow positive.

00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:08.430
I will say this--

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:10.830
three to six months
from now, more of them

00:58:10.830 --> 00:58:12.480
will consolidate,
go out of business,

00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:15.430
or get cash-flow positive.

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:20.200
They'll have a need to, as
I say, extend that runway.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:25.190
And then we have Carlos
with his anecdote.

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:26.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have--

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:31.230
I have a question as it pertains
to these banks in developed

00:58:31.230 --> 00:58:32.470
versus developing markets.

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:33.990
And I guess it's
for two reasons.

00:58:33.990 --> 00:58:37.080
One is that on one
end, the extent

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.138
of the unbanked or
underbanked population in--

00:58:40.138 --> 00:58:42.680
and especially because when you
showed the valuations, right,

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:45.720
Nubank is by far an outlier
in a country like Brazil.

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:48.120
So one is that probably
a lot of people

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:49.830
that are clients
of Nubank did not

00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:53.486
previously have bank accounts or
were significantly underbanked.

00:58:53.486 --> 00:58:55.820
And in a moment like right
now with the corona crisis,

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.320
I mean, they're going to need
these accounts more than ever,

00:58:58.320 --> 00:59:01.920
whereas people using neobanks
in developed markets,

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.480
like the United
States, arguably,

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:04.980
in a lower-interest-rate
environment

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:07.950
might be less prompted or less
interested in actually holding

00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:09.810
onto these accounts,
versus what they

00:59:09.810 --> 00:59:11.082
can use in traditional banks.

00:59:11.082 --> 00:59:12.540
GARY GENSLER: I
think you're right.

00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:17.450
But there's one other
aspect that you imply,

00:59:17.450 --> 00:59:19.380
but you didn't explicitly say.

00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.780
It's the cost structure and
the competitive structure

00:59:21.780 --> 00:59:23.140
in the countries.

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.120
So taking Brazil--

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:28.980
Brazil is a very
high-cost banking sector.

00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:32.730
It has a lot of historic
reasons about the concentration.

00:59:32.730 --> 00:59:35.100
It has to do with the
government involvement.

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:38.760
But of not just Latin
America, but around the globe,

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:42.060
it has, if not the
highest, one of the highest

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:43.440
net-interest margin.

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:46.320
This is the margin that
the traditional banks,

00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:50.550
like Itaú and others, are able
to charge between what they

00:59:50.550 --> 00:59:52.590
lend money at and what
they borrow money.

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:54.720
That's called the
net interest margin.

00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:58.830
And if in the US and even
in Mexico and Canada,

00:59:58.830 --> 01:00:02.040
we're running, give or take,
around 300 basis points,

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.590
meaning what you pay a
depositor versus what

01:00:04.590 --> 01:00:06.810
you lend on the other side.

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.940
In Brazil, it's
multiples of that.

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:13.160
Even for high-grade corporate
borrowers, it's more than that.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.440
But for small, medium-sized
businesses and the public,

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:20.130
it's close to 10 times
that, meaning it's

01:00:20.130 --> 01:00:25.770
20% to 30% net interest
margins for a certain sector

01:00:25.770 --> 01:00:26.950
of the market.

01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:30.720
So I think Nubank and the
four or five others in Brazil

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:37.270
had an opportunity because it's
a highly inefficient consumer

01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:40.180
banking and small and
medium-sized banking market.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:43.780
And recall from
our last class, I

01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:46.510
said that fintech companies
have largely focused

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:50.420
on the household sector, whether
it's mortgages, personal loans,

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:53.000
credit cards, and the like.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.170
They've focused on the consumer
sector of savings accounts

01:00:57.170 --> 01:01:00.360
and credit card
provisions and the like.

01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:02.760
And they focused on small
and medium-sized business.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.020
They're not trying to compete.

01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:07.110
Nubank is not trying to
compete with Itaú about the big

01:01:07.110 --> 01:01:08.460
corporate lending.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.540
And they're not going
to compete in Brazil,

01:01:10.540 --> 01:01:13.230
as about half of the-- half
of the lending at the big

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:17.340
corporate level is from
basically government-banked--

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.320
government-backed banks.

01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:23.160
So I think when you look
at the developed world--

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:27.060
the Europe, the
US, and so forth--

01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:31.710
we have challenges in our
banking system, but they're--

01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:35.190
it's around those
pain points I talked

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:38.490
about earlier about legacy
systems and legacy user

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:42.190
interfaces and sometimes
high fees and so forth.

01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:44.250
But in every country,
you have to look

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:48.060
at what's the inefficiency of
the current traditional banking

01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:48.960
system?

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.620
And is online banking,
is that an opportunity

01:01:52.620 --> 01:02:00.030
to shed a costly branch network,
shed costly legacy systems,

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:04.200
or, frankly, just do
it better, cheaper?

01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:06.750
Ultimately, that's what it is
about being an entrepreneur.

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:10.710
Can you do a better,
cheaper, faster?

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:15.430
And so how have the
traditional banks reacted?

01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:17.440
They're not staying still.

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:20.410
All the way back from the
online banking movement,

01:02:20.410 --> 01:02:24.280
they were right foursquare
in the online banking

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.490
movement of the 1990s
to the late noughts.

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:29.620
What have they done
in the last decade?

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.320
They've started to say maybe
we have to rebrand and do

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.400
something different.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.395
Goldman Sachs is not the
only one with Marcus.

01:02:35.395 --> 01:02:37.180
Now, Goldman Sachs is
an investment bank.

01:02:37.180 --> 01:02:39.850
They were not
protecting their brand.

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:45.070
But, as I said, Cap One in 2011
bought this big ING Direct.

01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:49.600
Cap One said oh, for $9 billion,
we can move to this other area.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.950
But then others are starting
to have named branded products.

01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:56.920
JPMorgan and others
are saying we maybe

01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:03.100
should do something that
looks like an online--

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.880
we'll even use a different
name and call it something else

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.260
and react.

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:14.440
So I wouldn't count out any of
these big traditional banks.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.300
And where we are
in three or five

01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:17.680
years is going to
be interesting.

01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:21.930
I also would encourage
you to think big tech.

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:25.060
Apple Credit Card is not
quite a challenger bank.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.450
Amazon Prime is not
quite a challenger bank.

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:33.550
But when do they, like Alibaba,
file for a banking license,

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:39.240
like Alibaba did and got
Ant Financial, like in Korea

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:47.430
Kakao has done and already is
just getting huge market share?

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:54.020
So I don't think that's too
much in our distant future.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:58.070
I think that's near term,
that we'll see that.

01:03:58.070 --> 01:04:00.140
Now, we have different
traditions in the US.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.780
We have a tradition,
both in culture

01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:05.330
and embedded in law,
about separation

01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:07.400
of banking and commerce.

01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:10.730
And we went through this
in the 1980s and 1990s,

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:13.040
when the department store
chains, like Walmart,

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.360
wanted to get into banking.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:17.330
And they-- there was all this
sort of back and forth about

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:20.090
whether they can have banking
licenses, what type of banking

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:23.480
license, and industrial loan
companies and other things

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:28.340
really in the intricacy of
banking law and licensing.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:30.980
We will have some of those
debates and challenges

01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:37.280
as well as, I believe, Amazon
and Apple and others and Google

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.180
get further into this space.

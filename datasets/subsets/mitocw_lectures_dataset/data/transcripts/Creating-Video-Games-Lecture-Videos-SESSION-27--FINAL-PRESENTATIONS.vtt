00:00:20.796 --> 00:00:23.531
PROFESSOR: So to all of our
guests, thank you for coming.

00:00:23.531 --> 00:00:27.780
This is the final presentations
for CMS.611 crossed listed

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.250
as 6.073 the Creating
Video Games class.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.280
In this class, we
have 40 students,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.780
learning how to make games and
learning about the production

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.370
process of making games.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.742
So a lot of the things we're
talking about in class,

00:00:41.742 --> 00:00:43.450
a little bit about
design, but often also

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.680
about how do you
communicate as a team.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.480
How do you get work done
on time and on schedule,

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.280
as I overheard a lot of things
happening this last week.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.940
Every year, we choose a
client to make games for.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.630
This year, we were very blessed
to have the Red Cross/Red

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.510
Crescent Climate
Centre, in Pablo Suarez.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.760
As our common
client, he presented

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.890
a number of different games,
ideas, and topics ideas

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.020
to the class.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.665
The class formed teams about
those for the final projects.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:19.131
And that's what we're
going to be seeing today.

00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:21.550
Our order of presentations
are going to be over here.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.341
So we're going to have
three presentations.

00:01:23.341 --> 00:01:27.000
Each presentation is about
20 minutes plus another 10

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.851
for Q&A and then
just tech switches.

00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:32.184
We'll have the intermission
after Heatwaves is finished.

00:01:32.184 --> 00:01:34.430
And then we've got two more.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.120
Cholera, I did not write down
the full name for your game.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.371
Your team, Lauren.

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.261
What is the full
name for your game?

00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:43.260
LAUREN: Cholera Control.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.740
PROFESSOR: Cholera Control.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.060
Make a note of that.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.767
So they and [INAUDIBLE]
will be last.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.600
I also wanted to mention
to all the students

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.910
here, if you're
interested in continuing

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.830
your education on game
development, as you can see,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.180
spring is loaded
with game courses.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.300
CMS.301, which is taught
by Sara and Michael

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.392
in the back-- hi, Michael.

00:02:03.392 --> 00:02:04.276
MICHAEL: Hi.

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:06.609
PROFESSOR: It is an introduction
to game design methods.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.725
In particular, it's unpacking
the idea of prototyping

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:12.110
[INAUDIBLE] for digital games.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.050
And the lessons
learned there can

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.030
be applied to pretty much
any kind of designer,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.290
but they're focusing
on game design methods.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.390
CMS.608, Phillip and I teach,
is board game and card game

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.252
design.

00:02:23.252 --> 00:02:25.460
It's structured, actually,
very similar to this class

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.210
with a few small projects and
then a final project at the end

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.052
that you spend about
half the semester on.

00:02:31.052 --> 00:02:33.010
And those, of course,
are non-digital games, so

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.270
board games, card games.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.380
We've had people do live
action RPGs and tabletop

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.100
RPGs, role-playing
games for that class.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.920
The next two courses,
CMS.610, Art, Science,

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.580
and Business Video Games, and
CMS.617, Advanced Game Studio,

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.550
also built on the team building
aspect but not as harshly

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.402
as we do.

00:02:52.402 --> 00:02:53.860
You won't be in
eight-person teams,

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.360
unless you really want to.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.530
Teams tend to be about four to
five people for those classes,

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.560
and actually as low as
three in some cases for 617.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.900
Right now in the catalog,
they both look like they're

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.100
being taught on Thursday.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.310
We are trying to
move 617 to Tuesday.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.156
So I'll send out an
announcement about that.

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:13.725
And then lastly, if you liked
creating the specific games

00:03:13.725 --> 00:03:16.120
you made in class this
semester, these kind

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.140
of educational
games, or do you want

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.275
to know more about how
games are used in education,

00:03:20.275 --> 00:03:22.525
how to make games for education
and how to simulations

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:26.180
in particular for
education, CMS.590

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.850
cross-listed I think-- I
didn't look up the number--

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.470
but my memory said
11.129 is Computer Games

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.460
and Simulation for Investigation
and Education, tion.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.325
That is taught-- last year, it
was taught by Scot Osterweil

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:45.456
and Jason Haas with Eric Klopfer
is the faculty on that course.

00:03:45.456 --> 00:03:47.330
A really great course,
I highly recommend it.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.788
You can look up
the syllabus in OCW

00:03:48.788 --> 00:03:50.790
if you want to
know more about it.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.464
And with that, we are
going to start with Snap.

00:03:55.464 --> 00:03:57.350
TEJ CHAJED: All
right, hi, everybody.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.369
I'm Tej, and I'm
from the Snap team.

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.410
We're going to start off
with a demo of our game.

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.910
So the way our
game works is it's

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.130
called Snap and
everybody participates

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.936
from their own computer.

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:10.560
We'll give you a
topic, and then you'll

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.830
enter words related
to that topic.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.130
And whenever you get the
same word as somebody else,

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:16.950
you'll get a point.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.360
So it's pretty simple.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.050
So we'll invite you to
join us at snapgame.org.

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.630
We'll be showing the
moderator interface.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.180
So normally, you
wouldn't be seeing this.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.854
The moderator would
do it on their own.

00:04:33.854 --> 00:04:35.437
But we'd like to
show this, because it

00:04:35.437 --> 00:04:36.353
is a part of our game.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.820
All right, and the topic we'll
be doing today, to mix it up

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.150
from last time, is video games.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.705
And we'll run the game for
about two minutes this time.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.170
All right, so I have no
idea how long it's been.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.971
But I'm going to
give a countdown,

00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:26.262
and I'm going to stop the game.

00:05:26.262 --> 00:05:38.770
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.980
And that's a game.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.340
Congratulations, Julia,
and Kevin in second place.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.240
This is what you guys invented.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.487
Thank you, guys,
for playing Snap.

00:05:57.487 --> 00:05:58.481
That was [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:58.481 --> 00:06:01.457
AUDIENCE: Luigi [? book. ?]

00:06:01.457 --> 00:06:02.457
AUDIENCE: What was that?

00:06:02.457 --> 00:06:03.451
AUDIENCE: Luigi.

00:06:07.924 --> 00:06:10.999
TEJ CHAJED: All right,
so as you can see,

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:13.290
this gives you an idea of
what you were thinking about,

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.706
what you think about when you
think video games, which not

00:06:15.706 --> 00:06:17.418
surprisingly right now is Snap.

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:24.480
And with that,
we've given a feel

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.780
for the moderator interface.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.779
And hopefully, you got a
chance to play the game

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:30.620
and see what the player sees.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.500
And we'll start
the presentation.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:39.460
So this game was made
for the Red Cross.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.630
Pablo actually helped
co-develop this game.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.990
And he presented it to
us as a face-to-face game

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:47.220
that they play at conferences.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.860
He provided feedback
and guidance.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.630
And in our project, in
particular, the client

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.810
was extremely helpful in giving
us an idea of what they wanted

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.970
and also helping us run the
game in their actual settings.

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.190
So we were able to see what
this looks like with the players

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.730
that we expect to play with.

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:07.460
For our organization
of our project,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.530
we split up into backend
and frontend teams.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.630
The backend worked
on both the server

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.730
and also the moderator interface
you saw here and to word cloud,

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:16.230
for example.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.370
This split was challenging
for new features,

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.440
especially, because
features would

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.930
be interdependent or
frontend couldn't do anything

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.475
until there was a backend.

00:07:28.475 --> 00:07:30.350
And there was a
communication gap throughout.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.260
When we needed to
add a new feature,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:34.140
the API between the
backend and frontend

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:37.390
wasn't necessarily
well-documented.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:39.800
But overall, we think that
it led to simpler management

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.070
within the teams.

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.840
We didn't have a lot of
organization within each team.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.950
There wasn't a lot of
explicit organization.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.510
But it did help to know
that a smaller set of people

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.468
would be working on the
frontend or the backend

00:07:50.468 --> 00:07:52.125
at any given time.

00:07:52.125 --> 00:07:54.625
In the future, I think we would
have gone even more specific

00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:55.514
in our roles.

00:07:55.514 --> 00:07:57.930
Like a few roles that we thought
would have been important

00:07:57.930 --> 00:07:59.420
include a UI designer.

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:03.090
This would have made sure that
UI design saw some first class

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:06.250
love from the beginning
and would have made sure

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.997
that we actually focused
on UI from the beginning.

00:08:09.997 --> 00:08:12.330
It also would have helped to
have somebody communicating

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.730
between the teams.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.160
This person may have
done some documentation

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.900
or may have simply
just made sure

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.150
that the frontend knew what
the backend was working on

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.066
and the backend knew
what the frontend needed,

00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:25.010
so we could prioritize
well between the teams.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.760
It also would have
helped to have somebody

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.200
dedicated to paperwork.

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.950
This would have helped both
in submitting class paperwork

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:33.179
and also just doing the
documentation that we needed,

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:35.720
both for ourselves
and the class.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.580
And finally, somebody
working on game design

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.020
would have helped us develop
more iterations early on

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.429
and think more about
the game aspects that

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:45.670
go beyond what we already
knew the game would

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:47.930
look like based on
the game of Snap

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.055
we played from the clients.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:53.490
As far as technology
for our organization,

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.120
we used Asana to
organize our tasks.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.947
Asana worked really well for us.

00:08:57.947 --> 00:09:00.530
In particular, it let us split
the task lists for the frontend

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:01.250
and backend.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.250
This was useful, because
generally, the frontend

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:07.560
didn't need to touch the
backend tasks and vice versa.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.890
But on the other hand,
we had a hard time

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.220
encoding task dependencies.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.690
This was particularly a
problem for a feature that

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.700
crossed both the
backend and frontend,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.670
where some API was
needed on the backend

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.790
and then was also
needed on the frontend.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.556
And you couldn't do
one without the other.

00:09:24.556 --> 00:09:26.880
We also had trouble
with task creation.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:32.500
And this basically meant that
people didn't create tasks.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.070
And part of this was that we
didn't have a specific role

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.260
for creating the tasks.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.530
And so, because of the
diffusion of responsibility,

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.488
nobody would go through
and list out everything

00:09:40.488 --> 00:09:42.552
that needed to be done.

00:09:42.552 --> 00:09:44.010
To improve that in
the future, we'd

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.790
like to get people
more invested.

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.910
Part of this was that people
had a lot of other classes.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:53.122
And it would have helped if
people both explicitly said

00:09:53.122 --> 00:09:55.080
how much they were going
to commit to the class

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:58.020
and also we made it
easier for people

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.140
to contribute with the
small amount of time

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.355
that they had available.

00:10:02.355 --> 00:10:04.120
SABRINA DRAMMIS: So
for communication,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.650
our group used an
instant messaging

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.256
application called Slack.

00:10:08.256 --> 00:10:09.630
And this was really
great for us,

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:11.920
because it allowed
us to separate

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.000
into different channels.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.960
As you see here, we have
frontend and backend

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.400
as two different channels and
then a general channel where

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.834
everyone can communicate.

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:22.000
And this let the frontend
people work on their thing

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
separately from the
backend, not needing to know

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.270
exactly what was going on.

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:27.810
But they could go look, if
they needed to reference

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:29.510
some conversation there.

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.920
The bad part about this was that
people weren't always online

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.020
and responsive right away.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.640
And I think we could of
made this not a problem,

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.970
if we required everyone
in our project to download

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:43.080
the mobile application.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.970
That way, they would get
a notification immediately

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.011
when they were mentioned.

00:10:46.011 --> 00:10:48.305
And they would be more
likely to respond quicker.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.390
TEJ CHAJED: On the
backend, generally things

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.200
went really well.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.710
Our technology, in particular,
worked really well for us.

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.750
We used node.js for the
server, and socket.io

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.100
for two-way communication
with the browser,

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.860
and Heroku to do deployment.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.660
We were explicitly forbidden
from using networking

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.000
in this class, which we
violated from the beginning.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.540
But I think that our experience
with networking and all three

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.600
of these technologies really
helped make that possible.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.180
We already knew how to use them.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.950
And that helped us
both debug issues

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.432
and understand what
we were working with.

00:11:24.432 --> 00:11:26.450
On the other hand,
the backend it seemed

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:28.040
had too much manpower.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.470
This manifested itself as
a problem on the frontend,

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.080
where sometimes we felt like
we didn't have enough people.

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.870
We could have had fewer people
working on the backend, which

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.060
would have made sure that it
was a small unified code base,

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.260
and we could quickly finalize
the backend and just move on.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.370
We actually deployed
the application,

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:51.200
and the client has been
using what we showed.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.120
This is actually a
quite early deployment

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.200
on November 18 in Berlin
with some students there.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.110
And you can see the words
that they generated.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.500
Here are some other deployments.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.490
One of the things that made this
class-- what was challenging

00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:06.870
for us is that we had to
manage both client expectations

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.410
and the course expectations.

00:12:09.410 --> 00:12:12.670
So because they were
asking us to do these runs,

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:15.970
it seemed important to
us to support these runs.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:18.920
And it was hard to balance doing
this and also during the tasks

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:24.130
that the course required of
us and needed for us to do.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:25.750
SABRINA DRAMMIS: So
I'm going to talk

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:29.210
a little bit about our frontend
design and that process.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.570
So initially, when we
started the project,

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:36.990
we had this idea that people
would be represented as a car

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:38.927
and they would be
racing other players.

00:12:38.927 --> 00:12:40.510
So we thought it
would be a great idea

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.200
to use Phaser, which is a
sprite-based game framework.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.175
But as you see here, we didn't
go through with the car idea.

00:12:48.175 --> 00:12:50.290
And we had no sprites.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.590
But we still used Phaser to
make this, our first design

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:54.190
iteration.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.669
And we realized we didn't
really want that type of look

00:12:57.669 --> 00:12:58.210
for our game.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:00.620
We needed something more
professional and more abstract

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.810
that could be used in any
sort of setting that Pablo,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:05.570
our client, may use it.

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:07.060
So we completely
scrapped Phaser.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.570
And we redid our
frontend design,

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:15.180
deciding to just use
Bootstrap and CoffeeScript.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.920
And this was our second design.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.990
As you can see here, it's just
very typical Bootstrap styling,

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.290
if you've ever used
Bootstrap before.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.920
So we tried to add a
little bit of flavor.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.680
And we also needed a better
way to kind of represent

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.690
how the game is
progressing to the player.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.040
We currently had no idea
for that in this design.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.050
So then we came up
with the final design

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:42.320
that you guys played,
our theme of having blue.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.880
And then we created this
visualization to the right,

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.280
where each player is
represented by a dot.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.730
And snaps are represented by
lines being drawn to dots.

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.250
And your height
is representative

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.000
of your score in relation
to all the other players.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.750
So how we kind of got to
this final visualization idea

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.560
was an interesting process.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.020
First, we thought it'd
be really cool to have

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.280
a word cloud on the frontend,
as well as the back end.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.640
But a player would only
be able to see the words

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:13.640
that they had submitted.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.270
All the other words
would be blurred out.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.910
But this didn't really
convey to the player

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.430
where they were in relation
to all the other players.

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.240
So there wasn't any
sort of competitiveness.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.970
So we came up with this
idea of having a race line,

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.500
where all the players
would be on the line

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:36.320
and the height would represent
their score and their position.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.740
And then we thought, well, we
can put these both together.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.500
But we investigated
the word cloud.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.930
And we realized it'd be
extremely difficult to blur out

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:43.900
these words.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.150
And it wasn't really going to
be the best use of our time.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.820
So then we came
up with this idea

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:51.880
of using dots to
represent players.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.080
And we thought it'd be cool
if the size of your dot

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.570
represented your score.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:59.460
But the use case
for our application

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.410
could involve 100
players or even more.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:05.760
So a lot of growing large dots
could really clutter our UI,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.670
so we needed to rethink this.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:12.030
And this is when we finally
ended up deciding on height

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.100
representing score.

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.705
So I think we had really
good UI designers.

00:15:17.705 --> 00:15:18.830
And they were really quick.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:21.090
Once we thought
of ideas, we were

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.490
quick being able
to implement it.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.260
But the bad part was that we
were really late in coming up

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.850
with design decisions.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.320
We didn't start
thinking about how

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.180
we wanted to convey
the game to the player

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.240
and how we wanted to make the
player feel about the game

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.870
until really late
in the project.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.510
We focused more on what
the client needed as far

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.440
as mechanics and not really
what the player was getting out

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:45.890
of the game.

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:47.440
So in the future,
definitely we need

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:50.280
to think about design
right from the get-go.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.390
And we need to start prototyping
all the ideas that we have

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.340
and testing them
out more thoroughly.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:16:00.730
TEJ CHAJED: So in summary,
the high points of our project

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.654
are that we did make
the client happy.

00:16:02.654 --> 00:16:04.820
And they've been using our
application and the game.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.650
And they really like the game.

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.290
We're glad that
we focused on fun.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:09.840
The game has been
fun throughout.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.640
And players seem
to really enjoy it.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.300
And I think maybe this is just
because of the core concept.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.260
And we're glad that, even though
this is an educational game,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.100
it is intended for purposes
honestly of data collection,

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.830
people really enjoy playing it.

00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:24.960
Unfortunately, we had
slow design iteration.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.470
This prevented us from
really fully realizing

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:30.580
all the ideas that we had
and figuring out which

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.354
one would be best for players.

00:16:33.354 --> 00:16:35.520
In the future, we'd like
to get people more invested

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.630
to try to solve these
issues and make sure

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.970
that we best use
our time and create

00:16:40.970 --> 00:16:42.935
the best product possible.

00:16:42.935 --> 00:16:44.435
And with that, we'll
take questions.

00:16:57.714 --> 00:17:02.026
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Is there
a maximum number of players?

00:17:02.026 --> 00:17:04.230
TEJ CHAJED: We did
some stress tests

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:06.710
to see how much the backend
on Heroku could support.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:13.050
And that seemed to work OK
up to 150 players or teams.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:15.630
We are not really sure
what the frontend might

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.783
look like at 150 real players.

00:17:17.783 --> 00:17:19.574
That might be actually
the limiting factor.

00:17:24.709 --> 00:17:27.150
AUDIENCE: Is that
150 people playing

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.725
the same session or in the
multiple sessions 150 people?

00:17:30.725 --> 00:17:33.100
TEJ CHAJED: We currently don't
support multiple sessions.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.630
This is actually a request that
the client repeatedly gave us.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:37.463
But we thought that it
was just much simpler

00:17:37.463 --> 00:17:41.100
to avoid that for now, because
it wasn't strictly necessary.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:45.161
Most likely, the
load on the backend

00:17:45.161 --> 00:17:46.660
would be the same,
whether they were

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:49.780
split into multiple sessions.

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:52.660
But this is a solvable problem
by getting a beefier backend.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.157
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:17:54.157 --> 00:17:56.609
But right now, the backend
supports 150 people

00:17:56.609 --> 00:17:57.650
logged in simultaneously.

00:17:57.650 --> 00:17:59.510
TEJ CHAJED: About 150.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:02.249
We can obviously pay money
to get better servers

00:18:02.249 --> 00:18:03.415
and then run with many more.

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:04.218
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:12.815
TEJ CHAJED: Any questions
from the audience?

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:21.040
AUDIENCE: So you got
some feedback from Pablo

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.630
specifically from the
moderator point of view.

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:30.140
And I'm wondering whether you
got any indication about what

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.544
the players felt outside of
this class plus your [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:34.544 --> 00:18:36.960
TEJ CHAJED: Sure, I think we
can both talk about our focus

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.379
tests, where we played with
players outside this class.

00:18:40.379 --> 00:18:42.420
SABRINA DRAMMIS: Yeah, so
one of the main things,

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.230
I played with maybe a
group of at most 10 people.

00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.530
And they knew each
other, so they

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:50.980
wanted to know who they
were snapping with.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.100
And they wanted to see
the names of all the dots,

00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.080
so they could know
who they were beating

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.030
or who they needed
to catch up to.

00:18:58.030 --> 00:19:02.201
But this would be unreasonable
in a large environment,

00:19:02.201 --> 00:19:04.200
especially when all the
people at the conference

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.491
probably don't know each other.

00:19:05.491 --> 00:19:08.139
But I think that would be
a really cool thing to do,

00:19:08.139 --> 00:19:10.055
if we continued working
on this in the future.

00:19:10.055 --> 00:19:11.970
TEJ CHAJED: And I also
ran a similar test

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.345
with people that
knew each other.

00:19:13.345 --> 00:19:15.664
And they actually used it
as part of their strategy.

00:19:15.664 --> 00:19:17.080
They knew what
other players would

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.050
be submitting for that topic.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:22.700
And they could use that
to their advantage.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.011
So, for example, we did a
topic of systems papers.

00:19:25.011 --> 00:19:26.510
And we had a professor
in the group,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:30.150
so his paper showed up a bunch.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:34.420
And I would echo what Sabrina
said, that players really

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.846
wanted more feedback
around the actual players

00:19:37.846 --> 00:19:39.720
in the game, which we
specifically didn't do,

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.652
because the client didn't care.

00:19:41.652 --> 00:19:44.110
And in conferences, people
don't generally know each other.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.526
But I think that
if we were to use

00:19:45.526 --> 00:19:47.960
this as a more popular game,
then definitely focusing

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.670
on players and getting
more feedback, especially

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:51.720
after the game is over.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.803
People wanted to know who
they were snapping with.

00:19:53.803 --> 00:19:56.616
They wanted to see that graph,
all those lines overlaid,

00:19:56.616 --> 00:19:58.990
so they could see who they
were snapping with most often.

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:06.720
AUDIENCE: Does the team
have any plans for this game

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.664
after this class?

00:20:07.664 --> 00:20:10.127
I was wondering if you've
ever had discussions yet.

00:20:10.127 --> 00:20:12.210
TEJ CHAJED: I think we
haven't discussed that yet.

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.240
But I think definitely
we're interested in it.

00:20:19.088 --> 00:20:20.531
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:20:20.531 --> 00:20:23.898
TEJ CHAJED: Thank you.

00:20:23.898 --> 00:20:25.740
MATT: Hello.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.320
We are Hello waves.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.340
We're game about
forecasting, specifically

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.320
this idea called forecast-based
financing of using forecast

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.480
to make decisions about
possible disasters in the future

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.985
and how to prepare for them.

00:20:38.985 --> 00:20:41.610
We would actually like to start
with a playthrough of our game.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:46.564
So if anybody would like to
be a volunteer to try it out.

00:20:46.564 --> 00:20:49.030
AUDIENCE: A guest from
not our class, if one

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.180
could please come down, Andrew.

00:20:57.615 --> 00:21:01.575
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for volunteering.

00:21:01.575 --> 00:21:04.036
ANDREW: Hi, I'm Andrew.

00:21:04.036 --> 00:21:05.535
AUDIENCE: Well, do
you need a chair?

00:21:05.535 --> 00:21:07.261
AUDIENCE: Here's one.

00:21:07.261 --> 00:21:09.510
MATT: I'm not quite sure how
to make that full screen.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:12.812
But anyways, this is our game.

00:21:12.812 --> 00:21:14.520
I'd recommend looking
at the instructions

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.538
first and reading through them.

00:21:17.538 --> 00:21:20.340
Thanks.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.880
And we'll keep the
description minimal

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.480
as you read through it just
to sort of show the player's

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.078
initial reaction to it.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:29.785
ANDREW: Now, this
is real, correct?

00:21:29.785 --> 00:21:30.826
NORMAN: You're signed on?

00:21:30.826 --> 00:21:33.290
MATT: Oh, is it?

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:33.790
Oh.

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:35.275
NORMAN: Yeah, right.

00:21:35.275 --> 00:21:36.265
OK, sorry.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:42.700
Music.

00:22:09.285 --> 00:22:10.410
MATT: Yeah, start up again.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:16.260
So as you can see, our
game, as I said before,

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.560
you control some toys
on a day at the beach.

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.550
And so by dragging and dropping
them between the castles,

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:33.280
you'll see that their
statuses change and say

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.360
that they want to move
on their next turn,

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.440
or that they want
to be collecting--

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.240
or that they're going to be
collecting candy, or anything

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.790
like that.

00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.990
And the game is turned based.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.160
So all the actions will
resolve on the next turn.

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.904
ANDREW: Am I rating this race?

00:23:19.904 --> 00:23:20.629
MATT: Yeah.

00:23:20.629 --> 00:23:23.128
NORMAN: You can also access the
help through the lower right

00:23:23.128 --> 00:23:23.872
corner as well.

00:23:40.736 --> 00:23:43.690
MATT: And so when you
go to the next turn,

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:48.940
you'll see all the toys move
as specified by the status

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.782
bubble above their heads.

00:23:50.782 --> 00:23:56.494
ANDREW: So I go to the next
turn, or do I get a next turn?

00:23:56.494 --> 00:23:58.390
MATT: But unfortunately,
you'll find

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:02.366
that when toys have been
evacuated, they're unhappy

00:24:02.366 --> 00:24:04.615
and need candy to survive,
so they'll all take damage.

00:24:07.822 --> 00:24:10.774
ANDREW: They don't
want you to evacuate.

00:24:10.774 --> 00:24:13.234
MATT: You can try returning
them to their homes.

00:24:29.962 --> 00:24:32.360
NORMAN: And so you'll
see that on this turn

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.210
instead, now they have
their statuses set

00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:37.715
to gathering candy, except for
the dump truck, who is still

00:24:37.715 --> 00:24:38.215
evacuated.

00:24:46.394 --> 00:24:49.328
ANDREW: Got you, OK.

00:24:49.328 --> 00:24:50.795
But he needs to be evacuated.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:01.450
NORMAN: Exactly.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.927
And so the idea is that as
a player plays through it,

00:25:03.927 --> 00:25:06.260
they get better at understanding
how to use the forecast

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.447
to make decisions
about the future,

00:25:09.447 --> 00:25:12.030
both in terms of how much candy
that they need to have stocked

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.880
up in order to weather
out the rising tides

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.100
and also in terms
of when they're

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.610
going to need to move
their workers out

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:22.244
of-- their toys out of the
areas that are in danger.

00:25:22.244 --> 00:25:24.077
ANDREW: They're going
to be really impacted.

00:25:58.636 --> 00:26:00.340
MATT: I think you
have those two guys.

00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:02.276
ANDREW: Oh, they're in there?

00:26:02.276 --> 00:26:04.440
Is there a reminder
of where they started?

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.190
MATT: Yeah, it's on the castle.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.555
It's actually blocked
out right now,

00:26:08.555 --> 00:26:10.930
but toward the front of it.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:14.160
But there's a little
shadow there, an imprint.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.580
Because he ran out of candy
and then-- or actually, sorry,

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:27.629
because he went to a
place that was underwater,

00:26:27.629 --> 00:26:30.170
he took too much damage and then
was swept away by the waves.

00:26:42.772 --> 00:26:44.230
And so on the
forecast, you can see

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:48.090
that high water is coming
for quite a while, which

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.720
is going to be a
danger for the toys,

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.960
both in terms of possibly
getting swept away

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:56.509
and not having enough candy for
all the toys that you're going

00:26:56.509 --> 00:26:57.800
to have to move out of the way.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.716
ANDREW: [INAUDIBLE] this time.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:05.925
NORMAN: Oh, he may
be out of luck.

00:27:05.925 --> 00:27:06.637
MATT: Yeah.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:14.370
And when you've lost two
toys, you lose the game.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.320
ANDREW: OK.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.510
MATT: Thank you for playing.

00:27:21.319 --> 00:27:22.235
So that's Hello waves.

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:35.560
So in our game, we had a
few challenges to overcome.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.060
The first was that
our game was based

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.820
on forecast-based financing,
which is a very abstract topic.

00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:46.090
It's a pretty
understandable idea

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.870
of using information about
the future and ideas of risk

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.540
in order to decide where
to allocate resources.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.790
But it's still a bit abstract.

00:27:53.790 --> 00:27:57.706
And building a game around
it took a little bit of work.

00:27:57.706 --> 00:27:59.330
It's useful to note
that it's different

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:00.420
than long-term planning.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.370
It's not just thinking about
what will happen in the future,

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:06.410
building a dam to prevent
water or things like that.

00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.000
And it's actually about
using the information

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.380
you have to make the
best decision for events

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:15.750
that may be upcoming in
the semi-near future.

00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.730
We also wanted to avoid
making a game that

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.340
was overly preachy or
simplified, where it was clear

00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:22.936
exactly how you're going to win.

00:28:22.936 --> 00:28:24.310
And you could just
basically push

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:26.770
the forecast-based financing
button to win the game.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.860
We wanted players to
actually think and understand

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.830
the concepts there,
instead of just coming up

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.470
with the buzzword of
forecast-based financing.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:36.002
And finally, we
had the challenge

00:28:36.002 --> 00:28:38.460
of actually communicating that
forecast to players in a way

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:40.010
that they would be
able to understand

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:41.340
and then make use of.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.620
You could see in that game
that we had water levels

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:45.130
and it would show on the map.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:47.640
And we found that players
were pretty good at using that

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.950
in order to make
decisions about what

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.470
was going to happen
in the future

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.294
and how to allocate
their resources.

00:28:53.294 --> 00:28:55.460
The other big challenge
that we had in the beginning

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.310
was that our initial target
audience was policymakers.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:03.021
Like for Snap, Pablo had come in
and pitched us this game idea.

00:29:03.021 --> 00:29:05.020
And originally, he had
wanted us to build a game

00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.640
for policymakers that
would help them understand

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.600
the benefits of
forecast-based financing

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.850
and, therefore, convince
them that they should develop

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.240
policies that would give
resources to plans based

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.770
on forecast-based financing.

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:19.760
So I would like to take
you through a couple

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.720
of our prototypes just to show
you the evolution and comment

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.570
sort of on our process.

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:31.300
Actually, to preface that,
we had a lot of prototypes,

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.310
because of our idea
was so abstract

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.910
and because we weren't sure
how to address our audience.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:38.670
So we built a lot of
prototypes to start with.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:42.454
We had ideas that ranged
across sort of levels of scope

00:29:42.454 --> 00:29:44.870
of what you controlled, where
you controlled entire cities

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.619
or where you controlled
individual workers

00:29:46.619 --> 00:29:47.780
and moved them around.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.540
And then we would pull from
all these different kinds

00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:51.800
of ideas what worked, what
didn't, what did people

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.760
understand, what confused them.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.820
And from that, we got
a really good idea

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.660
of what concepts helped
people understand the idea

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.710
and brought them into this final
game that we ended up with.

00:30:02.710 --> 00:30:05.530
So the project
started on October 15.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.110
And this was our
first prototype.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.210
It was a terminal-based
game, where

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:12.330
you had some kind of information
about a future rainfall.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:15.140
And then you had to type in your
commands of how you controlled

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:16.900
different cities.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:19.720
This, actually,
people found it fun.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.410
But as you might expect, the
feedback wasn't very good.

00:30:22.410 --> 00:30:24.220
And people didn't
quite understand

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.510
how to move forward with it.

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:29.110
It put a lot of
cognitive load on people.

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:31.340
So when we moved
forward, we tried

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:35.660
to give people more easily
understandable actions to use.

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:38.710
But the problem with this game
was that it was time based

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:39.940
and it updated every second.

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:41.815
And so there are so
numbers flying at people,

00:30:41.815 --> 00:30:44.690
like even MIT students who play
tested it couldn't understand.

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:46.920
So we figured that
people like policymakers,

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:48.880
who didn't have much
experience with games,

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.590
really wouldn't be able to
understand the game at all.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.930
So instead, we
went to turn based.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.260
And that helped.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:58.730
But at the same time, it's
tough to see on this projector,

00:30:58.730 --> 00:31:00.560
but we have a forecast
underneath that says

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.260
how much rainfall is expected.

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.260
And again, that wasn't
understandable to people,

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.843
because they couldn't understand
what three inches of rainfall

00:31:06.843 --> 00:31:08.029
meant for their city.

00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:10.070
And they couldn't understand
how that contributed

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:11.652
to a possible disaster.

00:31:11.652 --> 00:31:13.610
At this point, Pablo
actually came by the class

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.900
and played the game.

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.270
And then he told us
that he wasn't even sure

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:19.300
that he could get
policymakers to play the game,

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.090
because they may not
have enough time.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.789
Instead, he wanted us to
switch to grade schoolers,

00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:25.330
because we could
teach them something

00:31:25.330 --> 00:31:27.660
about forecast-based financing
and help them understand

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:30.052
as they grew up.

00:31:30.052 --> 00:31:31.760
And this was great
for us, because making

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.230
a game that was serious,
easy for somebody

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:36.770
who didn't have experience
with games to play, and also

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:40.680
fun and engaging was too
difficult for us actually.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.930
So moving to grade
schoolers was awesome.

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:48.310
He also suggested that we try
to make the idea of rainfall

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:50.990
or water levels more visceral.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.450
And that's when we came upon
this idea of the rising waters.

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.830
Whenever players looked
at this, they instantly

00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:58.480
understood the
concept of the game.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.150
The feedback might not be there.

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.710
The beautiful UI
might not be there.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:05.020
But the idea of having
cities with workers in them

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.890
and a rising water level
coming towards them, everybody

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:08.800
understood that.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.425
And it made it a lot
easier for players

00:32:10.425 --> 00:32:12.220
to reason about the game.

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:15.170
From there, we added things
like nicer art, better feedback,

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.770
which you can't quite see
in the static picture, more

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.300
improvements to how
the forecast worked.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:27.740
And eventually, we ended up
with our final version today.

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:31.180
NORMAN: So to talk a little bit
about our actual development

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.820
process, so our team was
structured into three

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.270
main subteams, production,
which was in charge

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:39.700
of managerial roles,
deliverables, and play testing,

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.260
and so there was a shared
responsibility there;

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.900
technical team,
which was in charge

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.450
of the bulk of the coding
work; and a user experience

00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:52.910
team, which would be in charge
of assets, UI design, and UI

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:54.260
design.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:57.750
We also initially
envisioned subteam leaders,

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.460
where we'd be kind of
communicating through them.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.450
But we found the concept
kind of redundant.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.420
And so we've worked pretty
much with like a flat structure

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.570
between the three teams.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:12.140
So from the beginning,
we encouraged good coding

00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.640
practice.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.430
And so we used good
tools available to us.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:19.470
One of these is Yeoman, which
is a JavaScript scaffolding

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:21.470
framework.

00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:24.890
And this helped us out a
lot by basically automating

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.670
a lot of our JavaScript tasks
and making our code modular.

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:32.780
We also used Phaser
state machine,

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:37.430
which is this kind of badly
documented new feature

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:40.380
in the Phaser game engine,
which was the JavaScript game

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.940
engine that we used.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.730
It's a bit badly documented.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:47.520
But it did save us
a lot of headaches.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.200
And once we figured that out,
that proved immensely helpful.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:57.240
And we also used MVC, which is
a computer software engineering

00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.810
term standing for
Model View Controller.

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:03.360
And again, by encouraging
these good coding practices,

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.940
we reduced dependencies and
made sure that our team was

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:09.120
productive.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.480
In terms of communication,
we also, similar to Snap,

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:15.150
used Slack, which is kind of
like a modernized chatrooms.

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.860
It's very feature rich.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.360
And so you can share files,
channels, and things like that.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:23.870
And we also use the
idea of the Daily Scrum.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.070
We implemented it in class.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:29.219
And we would say what we
had done that class, what

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:35.300
we would be doing, and what we
wanted to do until next class.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.560
And so now, the major
challenges that we

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:41.860
faced during the development
process though where

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.960
that our team members came
from very different backgrounds

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.679
and had very different
preferences about games.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.679
Some of our team members are
very hardcore StarCraft players

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:55.980
and very good at RTS games,
while other members of our team

00:34:55.980 --> 00:34:59.920
preferred like a more laid
back mobile game Fruit Ninja

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.120
kind of approach.

00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:04.040
And so trying to mediate
those two viewpoints

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.650
and trying to create
a game that would

00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:11.550
engage both types of
gamers was a challenge

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.660
that we had to overcome.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.000
And so another big challenge
that we had in our development

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.105
process, as you saw
through our progression

00:35:22.105 --> 00:35:23.480
through our
different prototypes,

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:27.640
was that our direction was not
very clear, until about halfway

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:28.930
through the project.

00:35:28.930 --> 00:35:32.630
And so partially because we
had different ideas on what

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:36.020
the game should look like and
also partially because we had

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.670
such an abstract idea of
forecast-based financing

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:43.890
that even we didn't have that
good of a grasp on initially,

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:46.220
it took us a while
to really get settled

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.880
on what we wanted to build.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:52.400
And so this really challenged
our development process

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:58.340
and made us have to build a
lot before we got something

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.120
that we liked.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.390
And so eventually,
we did end up having

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:07.690
to cut some features
of like multiple levels

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:10.670
or like a guided
tutorial for the player.

00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:14.500
We thought that this would
introduce too much new content

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.700
that would need to be play
tested, balanced, and tested

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.420
to ensure consistency with
the rest of our game, which

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.320
we viewed as taking
up too much time.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:28.660
And we also cut the idea of
adding more individuality

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:32.270
to the workers or to
the toys that you saw,

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:34.150
other than different
graphics for each.

00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.647
MATT: Some of the worst
things that we did on our team

00:36:40.647 --> 00:36:42.230
is that we spent a
lot of time on work

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.150
that got thrown out entirely.

00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:47.420
All the prototypes we did, they
were actually pretty useful,

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.420
because of the things we learned
about the concept and about

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.070
how people would play the game.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.920
But we did spend a
lot of time on things

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.420
like art or nitty gritty
details that didn't really

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.670
need to be figured out and
that we could have put off

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:02.320
until later in the project.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.640
We also kept the game direction
too vague for too long.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.630
As Norman said, we spent
a lot of time with that.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.800
And it probably ate up
too much of our time.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:14.780
Although it helped
us learn, we could

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.650
have moved faster
in the beginning

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:18.120
to get to a solid idea.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.670
Because once we got to a solid
idea of the rising waters,

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:24.170
our team started to
centralize around it

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.730
a lot better, because
we could actually

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:27.970
deal with something concrete.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:30.030
While we were dealing
with the abstract ideas,

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:32.540
everybody was all over the
place and arguing about things

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.040
that didn't quite line up.

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:38.430
And the worst decision of
all that we started with

00:37:38.430 --> 00:37:41.200
and that sort of made the
problem of going too vague

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.791
and all these
other things happen

00:37:42.791 --> 00:37:44.290
is that we were
originally thinking,

00:37:44.290 --> 00:37:48.030
how do we skin forecast
based financing as a game?

00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:50.690
How do we take this
idea of using forecast

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.210
to make decisions and
then just gamify it,

00:37:54.210 --> 00:37:57.650
which we eventually
realized wasn't fun

00:37:57.650 --> 00:38:00.557
and didn't help us actually
come up with any ideas.

00:38:00.557 --> 00:38:02.140
Instead when we
flipped it and started

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:05.260
talking about what game
could we create and use

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:09.140
forecast-based financing to
improve it and teach players

00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:12.390
how to play the game and,
therefore, allow them to come

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.220
out of the game, having learned
about forecast-based financing,

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.530
the world sort of opened up.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.238
Everything became a
lot more interesting.

00:38:18.238 --> 00:38:21.892
And we found that we
started to move faster.

00:38:21.892 --> 00:38:24.350
Some of the best decisions that
we made, on the other hand,

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:26.520
as Norman said,
we had good tools,

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.610
which meant that even when
we threw out prototypes,

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:33.020
although we wasted things
like art resources and things

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.350
like that, we actually didn't
end up wasting very much code,

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:39.000
because things like the
idea of workers or cities

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.500
could literally be pulled
out of the old games we had,

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:43.870
put into our new game,
and then reworked

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:47.670
to build our new structure.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.510
We also weren't afraid
to trust each other

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:52.210
and throw out the
things that didn't work.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.890
Once we started
moving fast, we had

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.575
a lot of ideas that
would come out,

00:38:55.575 --> 00:38:57.680
and we would say, OK,
this doesn't work.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.290
We're actually
going to scrap it.

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:03.210
Or we think that this isn't
the direction we need to go in.

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:06.641
And everybody was willing
to go along with it.

00:39:06.641 --> 00:39:08.890
It's not a good feeling to
see your things thrown out.

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.310
But everybody understood that
was for the best of the game.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.768
And I really appreciate their
understanding with everything

00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:14.710
too.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:16.710
And part of that all
comes down to the fact

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:18.900
that we were on board
with our final idea.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.465
We were all excited about
the concept that we had.

00:39:21.465 --> 00:39:23.090
Part of that might
have been the relief

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.881
of coming to a concrete
idea after spending

00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:26.330
so much time being vague.

00:39:26.330 --> 00:39:28.080
But once we had
the concrete idea,

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.120
we really moved fast and
worked well around it.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.875
So thank you and any questions.

00:39:41.495 --> 00:39:42.968
AUDIENCE: Who did your sound?

00:39:42.968 --> 00:39:44.932
It's awesome.

00:39:44.932 --> 00:39:47.040
MATT: That was from our UI team.

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:48.510
AUDIENCE: Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.329
OK, I really liked it.

00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.995
MATT: Thank you.

00:39:50.995 --> 00:39:52.450
AUDIENCE: Where did you find it?

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.120
NORMAN: So it's on
our credits page.

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.691
Most of it was online.

00:39:56.691 --> 00:39:58.152
The credits page in our game.

00:40:04.483 --> 00:40:06.431
AUDIENCE: And so you
don't want to type it in.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:11.830
MATT: It's a little
small, I guess, up here.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.637
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK, great.

00:40:13.637 --> 00:40:14.470
MATT: But it looks--

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:15.678
AUDIENCE: [? Switch games. ?]

00:40:15.678 --> 00:40:17.540
NORMAN: Yeah, "Hold
My Hand," AGP by--

00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:19.790
AUDIENCE: Would it be possible
to do a [? shortened ?]

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.646
URL of these?

00:40:21.646 --> 00:40:23.455
MATT: For the game?

00:40:23.455 --> 00:40:24.381
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:40:24.381 --> 00:40:26.880
We can make a Bitly link, and
we'll send it out to everyone.

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.652
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just
to entire-- yeah.

00:40:29.652 --> 00:40:32.370
MATT: That's a good call.

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:33.025
Yes.

00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:35.270
AUDIENCE: Having
watched the early crash

00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:38.712
and burn playthrough,
how often do people--

00:40:38.712 --> 00:40:40.170
I don't know if
you've actually had

00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:43.242
a lot of people to play your
current version of your game.

00:40:43.242 --> 00:40:45.100
Do people usually take
a playthrough or two

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:47.790
before they start
getting the concept?

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.070
MATT: Yes.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.274
That's why something like a
tutorial would be really nice.

00:40:52.274 --> 00:40:54.440
Unfortunately, we didn't
have the time to put it in.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.

00:40:55.580 --> 00:40:56.870
I was wondering how that-- OK.

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:58.900
MATT: Yeah, usually
what happens is,

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:02.750
even if after maybe a couple of
turns of playing through they

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.430
start to get the idea,
the problem is that,

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.310
as the water starts to rise,
they haven't prepared enough.

00:41:08.310 --> 00:41:12.180
And so all their workers or
the toys will starve or get

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:14.784
carried away by the waves,
which is a bit unfortunate

00:41:14.784 --> 00:41:17.200
and probably makes the players
feel bad on the first time.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.992
But then they-- it
actually teaches

00:41:18.992 --> 00:41:20.200
them to think ahead about it.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.640
So the next playthrough,
they're much more careful

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:23.390
and understanding.

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:30.090
AUDIENCE: Yes, I
was wondering if you

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:34.920
were playing any other games
or thinking about other games

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.160
as the inspiration
or thinking about how

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.946
to deal with sort of
getting the right level

00:41:39.946 --> 00:41:43.738
of strategic thinking
in your game.

00:41:43.738 --> 00:41:47.750
NORMAN: Well, so I guess
in terms of early on.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:49.470
Because we had a
very different idea

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.720
of what we wanted to do
early on in the process,

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.760
we were thinking about games
like Civilization and how

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:59.030
did they communicate all
these complex worker movements

00:41:59.030 --> 00:42:01.400
and managing multiple cities.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:05.410
But once we actually came
up with this game concept,

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:09.960
I think we had much,
much smaller goals.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.752
And so did we have any specific
game models, do you think?

00:42:14.752 --> 00:42:17.910
MATT: There is none that
I specifically think of.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.160
There were some things that
we were sort of inspired by,

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.550
standard tricks,
like when you hover

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.050
over one of the
characters, they got

00:42:25.050 --> 00:42:28.562
bigger, some idea of showing
off that this is clickable,

00:42:28.562 --> 00:42:29.270
things like that.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:33.330
But specific games
themselves, not really.

00:42:33.330 --> 00:42:35.665
AUDIENCE: I was just
thinking it ended up

00:42:35.665 --> 00:42:37.540
being kind of war gamey.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.680
And I feel like there's
a lot of war games

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:42.553
that where I'd thinking
a lot about getting

00:42:42.553 --> 00:42:48.469
that right level of I guess
tactics rather than strategy.

00:42:48.469 --> 00:42:50.934
But, yeah, I guess it
worked out kind of.

00:42:54.385 --> 00:42:56.460
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned that you

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:59.310
were able to completely
change how your workers looked

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.805
and just keep your models.

00:43:00.805 --> 00:43:04.181
So that's sort of the Holy Grail
of object-oriented programming,

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:06.129
that kind of object
that's reusable

00:43:06.129 --> 00:43:08.660
and you don't have to
throw out the code.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:10.911
Do you think there's a reason
why, in particular, you

00:43:10.911 --> 00:43:13.202
were able to achieve that,
because I think that's not--

00:43:13.202 --> 00:43:15.940
that's not common necessarily
in object-oriented programming?

00:43:19.314 --> 00:43:22.400
NORMAN: Partially, a
little bit of OCD-ness

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.850
like very early on,
very strictly saying

00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:27.960
we're going to write this
object-oriented code,

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.210
and we're not just going
to hack things together.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:33.020
I think that helped a
lot, because we actually

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.760
spent the time in
the very beginning

00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:38.000
to think about
like which objects

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.860
were responsible for what and
what their purpose should be.

00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.840
Yeah, basically,
I think because we

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:46.640
moved more slowly in
the start and thought

00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:49.340
more carefully about how that
code should be structured,

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.800
we ended up with having
an easier time later on.

00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.525
MATT: There's also the
fact that because we

00:43:55.525 --> 00:43:57.380
had learned these things
from the prototype

00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:59.970
that we are putting into
this game, that also meant

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:04.840
that the objects that we
created because we wanted

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.190
similar functionality to
things that we had already seen

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:09.070
and we knew worked,
it meant that we

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:12.570
were comfortable pulling out
the functionality into that.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.190
I don't want to say it
was designed to fit.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:22.712
But there is the fact that we
moved it on purpose, really.

00:44:22.712 --> 00:44:24.930
AUDIENCE: I would like
to say something on it.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.770
So we had a very good MVC model.

00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:32.400
So models were at and has
a tree-like structure,

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.922
I think it was very easy to
change the model somewhere else

00:44:35.922 --> 00:44:37.889
[? and knew it ?]
involved-- sorry,

00:44:37.889 --> 00:44:40.264
used our new evolved models
once [? models and no idea ?]

00:44:40.264 --> 00:44:41.248
of what happens.

00:44:41.248 --> 00:44:43.708
So basically, it was
[INAUDIBLE] change.

00:44:48.136 --> 00:44:49.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.104
All right, thank you.

00:44:53.548 --> 00:44:55.640
MIRIAM: Hello, my
name is Miriam.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:58.460
And today, I'm going to be
presenting for Team Heat Wave.

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:01.110
And we made a game
called Heat Wave.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:05.600
So the goal of Heat
Wave was and is

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:08.370
to educate Red Cross
workers about how to prepare

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:10.360
for and handle heat waves.

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.270
And if you've never been
through a heat wave,

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.220
it's just defined as
elevated temperatures

00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:16.790
for an extended period of time.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:18.440
And the way you
prepare for that is you

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:20.330
set up umbrellas for shade.

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:21.600
You get water coolers.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.220
And during the
actual event, you try

00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.830
to go inside and drink an
excess amount of water.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:29.120
So while we had that
game goal, we also

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:34.220
had design goals of usability,
playability, and education--

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.360
usability because if
the game doesn't open,

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.320
it doesn't turn on,
that's a problem,

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.531
it doesn't work, playability
because we wanted people

00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:42.280
to be able to play
through the whole game,

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:46.460
it's just very fundamental,
and education because this game

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.310
is meant to educate Red
Cross workers about how

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:50.340
to deal with heat waves.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:53.050
So we really wanted that to be
one of our primary objectives

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.240
for the game.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:59.680
So to meet these goals, we
had our design processes.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:01.410
And I'll talk a
little bit about each

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.220
of these in detail in a minute.

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:05.400
But we started off
just as the other teams

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:06.850
did with brainstorming.

00:46:06.850 --> 00:46:10.380
Then we formed a team
based off of our ideas.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.880
And then we broke
down responsibility.

00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:16.080
So one person was in charge
of one aspect of the game.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.320
Another was in charge
of like the graphics,

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.430
all separate tasks.

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:21.030
And then we
continuously updated.

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:23.970
And what we used for that
was Trello, primarily.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:25.720
And I'll talk more
about that in a minute.

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:27.300
So brainstorming,
we were actually

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:31.000
right there on the board
drawing things for a while.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.800
And we had two major ideas
going as a group of people

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.840
just considering this topic.

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:39.340
The two ideas we had were the
game we actually came up with,

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:43.490
where you play as a Red Cross
worker trying to help people.

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:47.440
And then our second game
was playing as a heat wave,

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.910
trying to make people faint.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:52.050
And while that actually
sounds like a lot of fun,

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:53.524
we stuck with the first idea.

00:46:53.524 --> 00:46:55.190
And the reason we did
that is we thought

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:57.490
we could get more
education into the game.

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:00.760
Because education was such
a primary focus for us,

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.547
we really wanted it to be
the core basis of the game.

00:47:03.547 --> 00:47:05.380
So we went with the
game that would directly

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.470
correlate to what these
Red Cross workers would

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:11.350
be doing out in the streets
before and during a heat wave.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:13.700
And based off of that
idea, we formed a team.

00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.480
We actually had a
pretty large team.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:17.339
This is eight out of
nine of our people.

00:47:17.339 --> 00:47:19.380
Joe wasn't in this photo,
because he wasn't there

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.010
that day.

00:47:20.010 --> 00:47:21.301
But we had a really large team.

00:47:21.301 --> 00:47:24.859
So we had to be really focused
as to like who was doing what

00:47:24.859 --> 00:47:26.150
and what was getting done when.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:27.816
Because when you have
such a large team,

00:47:27.816 --> 00:47:29.910
things can slip
through the cracks.

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:31.840
So we used Scrum.

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:34.740
And as you can see up there,
it says so many emails,

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:38.250
because there were
so many emails.

00:47:38.250 --> 00:47:41.600
But the way we dealt with that
based off of previous projects

00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:43.850
was to say, well, we're going
to have a lot of emails.

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:45.440
There's nothing we
can do about that.

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.010
But we can make the
emails relevant,

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:50.520
so we can break them
into different threads.

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:54.327
So the people who were
handling the character objects,

00:47:54.327 --> 00:47:56.160
they're just going to
have their own thread.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.270
And maybe like one person who's
communicating between teams

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:00.740
will also be on that thread.

00:48:00.740 --> 00:48:02.320
But it's really their thread.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.450
So we had a lot of emails.

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:06.190
But they were divided up
as to who got to see them

00:48:06.190 --> 00:48:08.061
and who it affected.

00:48:08.061 --> 00:48:10.060
And the other thing we
did is we had our Trello.

00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.152
And we constantly updated that.

00:48:12.152 --> 00:48:13.610
And we kept track
of what was being

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:15.960
done in this sprint
and previous sprints.

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:17.520
And it was really
easy to see what

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.150
was taking longer
than we expected

00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:22.805
and what was done, what was
done but could use improvements.

00:48:22.805 --> 00:48:23.930
Like you could make a note.

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:26.080
We had like a
not-done-yet section.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:28.840
So we really managed to
stay organized that way.

00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.220
And the other thing we
did to make sure things

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.650
got done was group meetings.

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:35.140
And these were quintessential
for our groups.

00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.890
We had a bunch of like
three-hour long meetings.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:40.250
And we would get
task after task done,

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:43.180
bug after bug fixed,
and really just worked

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:46.490
through for hours on end.

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:49.380
So once we had this game and
we were all working on it,

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:52.180
we had four focus
tests that we ran.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.790
And they all had a theme.

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:57.210
So our first focus test
was about the concept,

00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:01.650
can we educate people in
the basic mechanic of that

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:04.220
we think we're going to use.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.780
And I'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:07.363
The second one was
overarching issues.

00:49:07.363 --> 00:49:10.940
So I said our three design goals
were usability, playability,

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:11.740
and education.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.860
So that was really our
second focus assessed.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:16.010
The third focus
test was visuals.

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.650
Are we connecting with the user?

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:19.620
Are these the visuals
we want to have?

00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:22.330
And then for the fourth
one was game balancing.

00:49:22.330 --> 00:49:25.140
Does this game feel fun to play?

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.680
Is it working out?

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:28.770
So the first focus
test, we focused

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:31.050
on the general mechanics.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:35.170
We had a low fidelity
prototype, which is actually

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:36.610
a Python-based game.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:37.940
And there was a list of people.

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.370
And you could say, I want
to talk to this person based

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:43.780
on some attributes and
offer them water, tell them

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:45.010
to go inside.

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:47.600
And each turn, you could either
continue talking to them,

00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.680
say forget it, you're
being annoying,

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.390
or oh, you accepted
water, I'm going

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:52.639
to move on to the next person.

00:49:52.639 --> 00:49:54.150
Or you could do nothing.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:57.920
And what we learned very
quickly was that it was working.

00:49:57.920 --> 00:49:59.850
People were choosing
to try and help

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:01.410
people based on
their characteristics

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:04.810
and based on oh, well, this
person fainted really quickly,

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:07.310
and they were homeless,
so I think homeless people

00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:08.150
might faint faster.

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:10.066
Though actually, I don't
think homeless people

00:50:10.066 --> 00:50:10.847
were in this game.

00:50:10.847 --> 00:50:13.305
And we also experimented with
different types of dialogues.

00:50:13.305 --> 00:50:16.300
So we experimented with having
like very factual dialogue,

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.000
drinking water is
really important,

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.190
even if you're not too
thirsty versus something like,

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:23.990
hide your wife, hide
your kids heat wave.

00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:27.830
So once we had that
general concept in place,

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.850
we built a basic unit game.

00:50:30.850 --> 00:50:32.770
And we wanted to see
overarching issues.

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:35.580
So we had these
four-- well five,

00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:38.160
but one person has already
fainted in this picture-- five

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.649
different characters with
different attributes.

00:50:40.649 --> 00:50:42.190
And you could choose
to talk to them.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:44.390
It was the same
exact concept we had

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.760
in the Python text-based game.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.770
This time, it was a
little more visual.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.040
There were people and there was
a dialogue that would show up.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:55.550
But it wasn't fully there yet.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:59.470
And what we saw was the
usability and the playability

00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:01.770
were definitely
having issues here.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:02.945
You can see that.

00:51:02.945 --> 00:51:05.070
But the education was
definitely coming through it.

00:51:05.070 --> 00:51:07.522
In fact, people wanted
it to be more visual.

00:51:07.522 --> 00:51:08.980
And we saw that,
and we said, well,

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.060
we have to test more visuals.

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.600
So you can see, this was
the version we tested later.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:17.392
And we said, how is
this working, who

00:51:17.392 --> 00:51:18.600
are you choosing to click on?

00:51:18.600 --> 00:51:21.309
And people said, well, first
of all, it's confusing.

00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:22.600
All these people look the same.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:26.210
I can kind of tell who's a
woman and who might be a man,

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:27.242
but that's about it.

00:51:27.242 --> 00:51:28.950
The labels aren't
moving with the people.

00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:30.500
Even if they were
moving with the people,

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:31.541
they're really too small.

00:51:31.541 --> 00:51:32.850
We can't tell who's who.

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:35.025
And we said, well,
we have this art

00:51:35.025 --> 00:51:36.400
that we think
we're going to redo

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.590
all the art in the style of.

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:39.470
We're thinking about
getting rid of the labels.

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:40.310
Do you think that's a good idea?

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:42.059
And they said, yes,
get rid of the labels.

00:51:42.059 --> 00:51:43.320
They're too small anyway.

00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.402
And so we showed them
this caricature of one

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:47.860
of the types of the characters,
which is a homeless person.

00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:51.010
They're a very vulnerable
group to heat waves.

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:53.570
We said, this is kind of the
art style we were looking at.

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:54.840
We think it displays
more information.

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.881
Do you think that's good?

00:51:55.881 --> 00:51:58.370
And we got enormously
positive feedback on that.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:00.810
They say, definitely, I
would click on this guy,

00:52:00.810 --> 00:52:02.310
because he looks
like he needs help.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:04.444
And you'll see that later.

00:52:04.444 --> 00:52:06.610
Something else we were
having an issue with visually

00:52:06.610 --> 00:52:08.940
was that the way
people would go inside

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.080
is they would just
kind of wander out.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.690
But the way they fainted, they
would actually just disappear,

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:15.860
proof.

00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:18.335
So people didn't
notice it actually.

00:52:18.335 --> 00:52:19.960
And then they'd
suddenly be like, well,

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.590
there was 10 people,
and now there's

00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:24.330
five people, and what happened?

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:27.280
So we said, OK, we
know this is an issue.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:30.220
What do you think would be
the best way to visually show

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:32.631
that people are fainting
and that would emotionally

00:52:32.631 --> 00:52:33.380
resonate with you?

00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:35.338
And they said, well, we
want them to fall over.

00:52:35.338 --> 00:52:37.790
And maybe it'd be nice if
there were some other feedback,

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:39.810
like sound or something.

00:52:39.810 --> 00:52:42.220
And we said, OK, we'll
take that a step farther.

00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.890
And we did.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.300
And we'll talk about that later.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:47.850
And the third thing
that we really

00:52:47.850 --> 00:52:51.410
got back from this visual
feedback focus test

00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:54.230
was that there was no indication
when people were getting sick.

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:56.830
So in the real world,
if you're getting sick,

00:52:56.830 --> 00:53:00.500
you might like turned
red, get really sweaty.

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.880
If you're about to faint, it'll
be very obvious is the point.

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.260
And there was no
indication here.

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:07.080
So we said, well, we're going
to do something about it.

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:08.310
We're going to put that
on the back burner,

00:53:08.310 --> 00:53:09.320
keep thinking about it.

00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.010
And we are going to
fix that somehow.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.300
And so we put that
all into practice.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:16.180
And you'll see the
screens in a bit.

00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:20.070
But our final focus test, we
focused on game balancing.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:21.390
Is this game balanced?

00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:23.470
Are people fainting
at a reasonable rate?

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:24.980
The problem was
that we would have

00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.340
like six people all
fainting at the same time.

00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:31.680
They said no, they have to
faint at different increments.

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.510
And also on top of
that, we had an issue

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:36.170
where the temperature
was somewhat random,

00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:37.510
going up and down.

00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:39.780
And people were not
adjusting to that.

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:40.670
One day it was 110.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:41.980
The next day was 80.

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.669
And that's in Fahrenheit,
because I assume most of you

00:53:44.669 --> 00:53:45.710
use Fahrenheit typically.

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:47.760
But our game is
actually in Celsius now.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.690
But the idea was
that people were not

00:53:49.690 --> 00:53:51.190
adjusting to this change.

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:52.770
And it wasn't realistic.

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:56.620
So what we do now is we actually
ramp up the temperature,

00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:59.780
and so that the first day,
very few if any people faint.

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.790
And then the next day,
by the end of day,

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:03.880
people start fainting,
because it's getting hot.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:05.880
And then the third day,
they're fainting faster.

00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:08.680
And you'll see that in the
playthrough after this.

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:11.550
So during this whole process, we
made some good and bad choices.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.300
And I'd like to talk
about bad choices first.

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:17.000
So we made two major--
these were the two,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.580
I think, biggest
bad choices we made.

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.160
They're not completely
horrible or anything.

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:24.690
The first was that we
depended on external code.

00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:28.200
And the second is we focused
on education, not fun.

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:31.140
So when I mentioned the external
code, one of our teammates

00:54:31.140 --> 00:54:33.970
had a dialogue system
for unity, which

00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:38.140
is really cool, it looked really
nice, had lot of features.

00:54:38.140 --> 00:54:39.400
And we said, let's go for it.

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:43.000
We can use this as a foundation
to build a really complex game.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.320
And something we really
didn't stop to think about

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:47.930
was how much work is it
going to be to develop

00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:49.774
our game around this system?

00:54:49.774 --> 00:54:51.940
How much work is it going
to be to change the system

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.220
to fit our game?

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:57.570
And also are we going to
have time to do all of that

00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:00.660
and also focus on making the
game complete as a whole,

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:03.680
instead of just kind of
showcasing this one aspect.

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:06.120
And it turns out it was a
bit of a pitfall for us,

00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:09.280
because we didn't expect it to
take as much time as it did.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:12.150
And if we were to go back,
the teams kind of said,

00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:15.940
well, maybe we still do this
and we just deal with the issues

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:16.440
early on.

00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:19.170
But also, maybe we should have
just designed a simpler game

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:21.630
and not use this external code.

00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:23.270
Another bad choice
we made was we

00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:25.010
really did focus
on education, which

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:27.920
was good, because our
game does teach people.

00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:31.210
But it is an educational
game in the sense

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:34.120
that it's not the
most fun in the world.

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:37.470
And if we were to
redo this, we probably

00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:39.110
should have focused
on fun earlier.

00:55:39.110 --> 00:55:41.410
We played with
having funny dialogue

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:44.284
and making more emotionally
resonating effects.

00:55:44.284 --> 00:55:46.450
But at the end of the day,
it's an educational game.

00:55:46.450 --> 00:55:50.560
And it's really not
that exciting to play.

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.910
So that's something.

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:53.570
But in the process
of doing that,

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.370
we made some good choices too.

00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:58.830
And one of those good choices
we made was group meetings.

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:01.440
You get so much done
when you sit down

00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.160
with like most of your
team for three hours

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:05.790
and you just hammer through.

00:56:05.790 --> 00:56:07.480
And we did that multiple times.

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.840
And it really worked out for us.

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:12.860
Something else we did
well was prioritize.

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:15.120
Because we had a
team of nine people,

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:18.570
we really had-- availability
was kind of all over the place.

00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:20.530
And even when we
had group meetings,

00:56:20.530 --> 00:56:23.570
you could only really expect
like six people to show up.

00:56:23.570 --> 00:56:25.820
You were guaranteed that at
least three people weren't

00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:27.010
going to be there.

00:56:27.010 --> 00:56:29.360
Even if you did a
doodle, which we did.

00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.660
So what we prioritized
was based on group--

00:56:32.660 --> 00:56:35.020
we had groups of people with
different responsibilities.

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:39.026
But if there was a bug, we said,
OK, who is available right now?

00:56:39.026 --> 00:56:40.150
What are you're working on?

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:41.380
Is this more of a priority?

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:42.770
Can you do this now?

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:44.920
And that process worked for us.

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.340
We got bug after bug
fixed that way when

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:48.809
we weren't in a group meeting.

00:56:48.809 --> 00:56:50.350
And when we got to
the group meeting,

00:56:50.350 --> 00:56:52.910
people generally had a
sense of what was going on,

00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:54.670
because we were doing
this process of they

00:56:54.670 --> 00:56:57.080
kind of had maybe worked on
something for a little bit

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:59.370
based on it being a priority.

00:56:59.370 --> 00:57:01.730
So now, let's get
to the actual game.

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:06.905
So the game has a start screen
within an instruction screen,

00:57:06.905 --> 00:57:08.790
which is kind of the sublayer.

00:57:08.790 --> 00:57:11.610
The main game, which has
the day scene and then

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:14.260
a newspaper scene at the night,
and I'll show you all these.

00:57:14.260 --> 00:57:16.110
And then the end screen.

00:57:16.110 --> 00:57:18.800
So originally, this was what
our start screen looked at

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:20.160
that we play tested.

00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.260
And it was beautiful,
as you can see up there.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:24.350
No need for changes, right?

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:26.170
So we actually did change it.

00:57:26.170 --> 00:57:28.460
And so now, it's
the same background

00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.050
as a game for Cohesion.

00:57:30.050 --> 00:57:31.550
You have your play,
but you can also

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:34.091
use the instructions, which are
pretty useful if you've never

00:57:34.091 --> 00:57:36.020
played before.

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:38.590
And then that takes
you to our main game.

00:57:38.590 --> 00:57:40.280
Our main game
originally, you saw that

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.760
on the first focus test.

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.820
I think this is pretty similar
to our second focus test.

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:48.720
You see we had a progression
with the main game.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.610
It took a lot of iteration.

00:57:50.610 --> 00:57:52.600
And something originally
we didn't have,

00:57:52.600 --> 00:57:54.260
I said, was there
was no indication

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:57.690
of when somebody was getting
sick or their characteristics.

00:57:57.690 --> 00:57:59.070
It was a lot of issues.

00:57:59.070 --> 00:58:01.620
So we made some progress.

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.546
We added the indicator that
say, I'm about to faint.

00:58:04.546 --> 00:58:06.170
You should probably
try to help me now,

00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:09.160
which is that little explanation
part on part of their head.

00:58:09.160 --> 00:58:11.457
And then finally,
we redid pretty much

00:58:11.457 --> 00:58:12.290
all of the graphics.

00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:13.206
And that took a while.

00:58:13.206 --> 00:58:16.000
So we were in the process of
redoing them at this point.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.240
And now, the game
looks like this.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.920
So it's much more cohesive.

00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.230
All the art fits together.

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:23.355
The people are really
visually caricatures

00:58:23.355 --> 00:58:26.140
of the different types of
people you need to help.

00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:28.600
Elderly people, homeless
people, drunk people

00:58:28.600 --> 00:58:30.422
are all really
vulnerable to heat waves.

00:58:30.422 --> 00:58:32.630
And then there's some
characters that actually aren't

00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:34.190
on this screen
right here but that

00:58:34.190 --> 00:58:37.420
aren't as vulnerable, like
normal, like adults aren't

00:58:37.420 --> 00:58:38.320
as vulnerable.

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:41.761
And athletes aren't
as vulnerable.

00:58:41.761 --> 00:58:44.010
So at the end of each day,
when you play this through,

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:45.780
and you've helped your
people, and you've given them

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.270
water or set up
coolers or whatever

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:50.466
you wanted to do for the day,
you get to a newspaper scene.

00:58:50.466 --> 00:58:52.090
And the original
newspaper scene looked

00:58:52.090 --> 00:58:53.930
like this, a lot of text.

00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:56.450
It doesn't really
help you with much.

00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:57.920
No one really
cared much about it

00:58:57.920 --> 00:58:59.770
in the first
iterations of the game,

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:02.210
because the long-term objects
hadn't been adding yet.

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:04.470
So it's just the umbrellas
and the water coolers.

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:06.890
And so we changed it
to look like this.

00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:10.710
It's the same information,
just a little better organized.

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:12.950
And the other thing that
we added in the main game,

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:14.490
we added those
buttons that says,

00:59:14.490 --> 00:59:16.574
you can set up a water
cooler or an umbrella.

00:59:16.574 --> 00:59:17.740
And that takes your time up.

00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:20.100
So if it's cool outside,
maybe you do that.

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:23.500
But if it's like 110
degrees in Fahrenheit, then

00:59:23.500 --> 00:59:26.140
maybe you should focus on
helping people not faint.

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:28.280
So we had that.

00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:30.785
And then say you
finish, 20 people faint

00:59:30.785 --> 00:59:33.700
or whatever-- I think
it's 20 people faint--

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:35.100
and you get to the end screen.

00:59:35.100 --> 00:59:39.200
And our original game,
we had no end screen.

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.720
And the reason for that
was, I told you we really

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.410
focused on education not fun.

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:46.180
And we just didn't think,
part of the fun of a game

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:48.640
is seeing how long you survive.

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.500
But we just weren't
thinking about that.

00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:52.630
So we really reevaluated that.

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:55.250
And we said, OK, we
definitely need an end screen.

00:59:55.250 --> 00:59:57.520
And we have it
looking like this.

00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.660
So it tells you how
long you lasted.

00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.860
And then you can see
the credits for what

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:03.040
was involved in the game.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:04.360
And you can play it again.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.152
So there's more feedback for
the user of how they did.

01:00:08.152 --> 01:00:10.560
And if we were going to
do this project again,

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:14.280
there's two things I think
we'd do majorly differently.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:17.250
And the first is talking
about heat waves.

01:00:17.250 --> 01:00:20.540
Our group thought heat waves
were going to be really cool.

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.100
We were like, oh, people
are fainting everywhere,

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:26.497
and it's getting hot, and
we have to do something.

01:00:26.497 --> 01:00:28.330
And then you start
reading about heat waves.

01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:30.550
And basically, it gets hot.

01:00:30.550 --> 01:00:33.140
You tell people to go
inside or drink water.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.800
And that's about it.

01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:36.970
That's all a heat wave is.

01:00:36.970 --> 01:00:40.650
And so what we'd do differently
is really the passion aspect.

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:42.790
If we're going to do a
game about heat waves,

01:00:42.790 --> 01:00:45.570
we depended kind of
on our passion coming

01:00:45.570 --> 01:00:47.702
from the thinking
heat waves were cool.

01:00:47.702 --> 01:00:49.160
I think we should
have focused more

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:52.957
on having passion for the
game and then incorporating

01:00:52.957 --> 01:00:55.290
the-- well, also having the
game build around heat waves

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:58.220
but really having a more
exciting game that we

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:01.440
could somehow also get
that educational aspect in.

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.000
What wed also do differently
is accountability.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.560
I said we had nine people.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.590
Sometimes, people disappear
when you have that many people.

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:10.930
And keeping dibs on
everything, especially when you

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:13.960
have separate email threads,
can be a little confusing.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.269
So maybe look into
some of the tools

01:01:16.269 --> 01:01:18.810
that the other teams mentioned,
where you have multiple group

01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:20.130
chats and you can see them all.

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:23.050
That looks really interesting.

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:25.880
Future features, more
long-term options.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:28.520
I think that's one of
the things in our game

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:31.760
that really helps with
the planning aspect is OK,

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.220
do I want to be doing this,
like helping somebody now?

01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:36.730
Or do I wanting to be
installing an object now?

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:39.570
And really, our
game kind of depends

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:42.430
on that balance of choosing
who to help and then

01:01:42.430 --> 01:01:43.580
also what to do.

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.010
Am I helping or not?

01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:46.440
So more long term options.

01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.694
And then something we
originally conceived

01:01:48.694 --> 01:01:50.110
was to have multiple
environments.

01:01:50.110 --> 01:01:51.910
And we didn't have
time to implement this.

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:53.100
But in different
environments, you

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.290
do slightly different things.

01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:55.660
Like if you're in
an office, you might

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.993
want to install an AC unit,
which is different than what

01:01:57.993 --> 01:02:00.220
you'd do outside.

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.340
So really look into
multiple environments.

01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:04.570
Different countries have
different environments,

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:07.179
might have slightly different
strategies for what to do.

01:02:07.179 --> 01:02:08.970
And we really would
like to look into that.

01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:13.217
So before we play the game, do
you guys have any questions?

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:20.665
In that case, I'd
like a user tester.

01:02:20.665 --> 01:02:24.018
AUDIENCE: So someone who
hasn't played the game before,

01:02:24.018 --> 01:02:26.392
again one of our guests.

01:02:26.392 --> 01:02:26.892
Alex?

01:02:26.892 --> 01:02:27.850
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:30.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.120
MIRIAM: It's not
showing up there.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:36.240
Give me a second.

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.047
Display.

01:02:39.047 --> 01:02:40.755
You're going to have
to give me a minute.

01:02:40.755 --> 01:02:41.770
I didn't realize it
wouldn't show up.

01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:43.520
AUDIENCE: Make sure
that's not plugged in.

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.320
MIRIAM: Yes.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.695
I [INAUDIBLE] have
it plugged in.

01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:51.770
How do I mirror the screens?

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:54.577
Sorry, it just--
otherwise, he's going

01:02:54.577 --> 01:02:55.660
to have to stare up there.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:01.900
Oh, thank you.

01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:03.340
Don't look at my emails.

01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:04.760
There's so many of them.

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.260
OK, yeah.

01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:06.194
AUDIENCE: Are we good?

01:03:06.194 --> 01:03:07.194
MIRIAM: Yeah, go for it.

01:03:07.194 --> 01:03:08.142
My sound is on silent.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:11.460
There.

01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.310
AUDIENCE: All right?

01:03:14.310 --> 01:03:16.698
Let's see, solo, go
[? to tech ?] the instructions

01:03:16.698 --> 01:03:18.135
so thanks for [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:23.404 --> 01:03:25.425
All right.

01:03:25.425 --> 01:03:26.966
Let me read through
the instructions.

01:03:26.966 --> 01:03:29.382
It's going to offer homeless
people water, tell old people

01:03:29.382 --> 01:03:33.140
to go inside, install umbrellas,
or many other options.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:36.870
OK, so pause, click
on Pause button.

01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:38.630
OK.

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:41.945
[INAUDIBLE] whoop.

01:03:41.945 --> 01:03:43.384
MIRIAM: Sorry,
what just happened?

01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:45.175
AUDIENCE: I may have
clicked that actually.

01:03:45.175 --> 01:03:46.970
MIRIAM: Oh, did
you start the game?

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:48.220
Here, we'll just quit.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.910
No worries.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:51.410
Great.

01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:52.790
AUDIENCE: OK, thanks.

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:58.626
OK, I think we're ready now.

01:03:58.626 --> 01:03:59.126
Let's play.

01:04:02.479 --> 01:04:03.916
I'm going for the umbrellas.

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:08.648
OK.

01:04:08.648 --> 01:04:09.148
Yeah.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:18.840
All right.

01:04:42.224 --> 01:04:43.240
Wow, that's nice.

01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.650
Does it get darker
as it goes through?

01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:46.150
Cool.

01:04:55.970 --> 01:04:56.823
Whoop, uh-oh.

01:04:59.475 --> 01:04:59.975
Wake up.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.880
Hey, OK.

01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:11.800
Should I do it around here?

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.790
MIRIAM: Yeah, sorry.

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:13.780
Go through again.

01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:14.770
Try talking to someone.

01:05:14.770 --> 01:05:15.760
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.390
Is it--

01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:22.482
MIRIAM: No, it's something long.

01:05:22.482 --> 01:05:23.670
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:24.668
No worries.

01:05:36.644 --> 01:05:38.141
MIRIAM: All right, that's good.

01:05:38.141 --> 01:05:40.883
Thank you.

01:05:40.883 --> 01:05:42.632
AUDIENCE: Maybe, just
start the game over.

01:05:42.632 --> 01:05:44.935
MIRIAM: Yeah, should
I just-- yeah.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.391
It was working.

01:05:51.391 --> 01:05:53.044
OK, let me refresh the page.

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.240
There.

01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.365
AUDIENCE: Oh, there you go.

01:06:03.365 --> 01:06:05.530
MIRIAM: I don't
know what happened.

01:06:05.530 --> 01:06:06.970
Sorry about that.

01:06:06.970 --> 01:06:07.930
AUDIENCE: No worries.

01:06:13.210 --> 01:06:15.290
Oh, I see, you can give
them options to do.

01:06:15.290 --> 01:06:17.680
Oh, OK, that changes
it just a little, yeah.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:20.155
MIRIAM: Kind of
important, just a little.

01:06:20.155 --> 01:06:21.145
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.375
Oh, OK.

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:58.085
Let's see, I'll talk to her.

01:06:58.085 --> 01:06:58.585
Uh-oh.

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.020
Oh no.

01:07:12.408 --> 01:07:14.449
AUDIENCE: I actually caught
the rest of the game.

01:07:18.393 --> 01:07:19.379
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:25.113
Any last questions
for the group?

01:07:30.885 --> 01:07:34.252
AUDIENCE: I liked
the bird sounds

01:07:34.252 --> 01:07:36.492
and also the fire sounds.

01:07:36.492 --> 01:07:39.510
Are there other sound effects?

01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:41.370
MIRIAM: So we had music.

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.660
But it was really hard to find
good music for a heat wave,

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.610
because you think it sounds
hot and you don't really

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:48.700
think of anything.

01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:53.690
So we had this very eerie music,
which didn't really fit either.

01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:55.190
So we went for the
minimalistic bird

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:57.190
sounds, because we thought
it was the only thing

01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:58.331
that kind of fit.

01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:03.050
Is there any other sounds?

01:08:03.050 --> 01:08:03.667
No.

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:04.750
Yeah, we had other sounds.

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.255
Just they sounded wrong.

01:08:06.255 --> 01:08:08.380
We had fire sounds, like
in the background and that

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.860
made the whole
thing sound really

01:08:09.860 --> 01:08:14.316
dangerous and terrifying, which
is not what we want to portray.

01:08:14.316 --> 01:08:16.649
We want to portray that you
can do something and prevent

01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:19.000
anything bad from happening.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.273
And any other questions?

01:08:20.273 --> 01:08:20.773
Yes.

01:08:20.773 --> 01:08:23.149
AUDIENCE: So a lot of things
have changed in your game

01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:25.402
since Monday.

01:08:25.402 --> 01:08:28.720
A lot has changed since Monday.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.325
How did you manage the process?

01:08:30.325 --> 01:08:32.370
MIRIAM: So we
actually, we were going

01:08:32.370 --> 01:08:33.729
to have a meeting before Monday.

01:08:33.729 --> 01:08:35.770
But really, our schedules
didn't work out.

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:38.100
So we actually had, I
told you, group meetings.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.680
That's where we got
everything done.

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:43.189
We had like a three, four-hour
group meeting on Monday night,

01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:44.859
which we were planning to have.

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:48.450
And while there was like
a couple core things

01:08:48.450 --> 01:08:52.180
that we wanted to fix,
just like small like bugs

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:53.810
that we were
working on, and also

01:08:53.810 --> 01:08:56.410
while some people were
doing that, we're just like,

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:59.410
well, we have other people
who aren't doing anything

01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:01.700
and can't really help with
what's the major thing,

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.850
so why don't we just
like add other features,

01:09:03.850 --> 01:09:05.390
like it getting light and dark.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.490
Because that's something
we really had considered

01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:08.890
and we hadn't had time for.

01:09:08.890 --> 01:09:12.359
But in that group meeting,
where somebody had time,

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:14.580
we were able to add that.

01:09:14.580 --> 01:09:17.899
And it looks good.

01:09:17.899 --> 01:09:19.229
AUDIENCE: How did you test it?

01:09:19.229 --> 01:09:20.541
Like, did you--

01:09:20.541 --> 01:09:22.040
MIRIAM: Oh, so we've
been running it

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:25.700
like nonstop all of
yesterday and today.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.130
But then it broke.

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.540
AUDIENCE: Yep,
definitely, it happens.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.265
MIRIAM: Yeah.

01:09:31.265 --> 01:09:33.740
AUDIENCE: You also
went from a screen that

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:35.729
had pretty small
characters on it

01:09:35.729 --> 01:09:38.359
to a screen where the
characters were about

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:39.770
3/4 the size of the screen.

01:09:39.770 --> 01:09:41.330
How did that
decision come about?

01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:42.939
MIRIAM: So we had our drawings.

01:09:42.939 --> 01:09:45.212
And when I told you
we focused tested,

01:09:45.212 --> 01:09:47.420
then we had like a big
picture of them on the screen.

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:48.319
People loved it.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.654
But when we actually put
them onto the old screen,

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:52.279
they were really
small and you couldn't

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:53.880
see their characteristics.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.820
And we said it's better to have
people overlapping more often

01:09:56.820 --> 01:09:59.120
but actually being able to
see their characteristics.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.536
Because the
caricatures are really

01:10:00.536 --> 01:10:01.910
where the learning comes in.

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:04.970
Like, if you didn't notice,
the people who fainted

01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:10.030
were, I think, the drunk
people and an old person.

01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:11.520
So you start to
notice as you play

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.600
the game, OK,
homeless people faint

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.080
really fast if you
don't give them water.

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.600
And that's just like a fact.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.090
People who are
homeless typically

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:20.330
don't have enough
fluids in them.

01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:21.621
And they're also outside a lot.

01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:23.280
So it's really hot.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.564
So that's relearning comes in.

01:10:24.564 --> 01:10:25.980
So we wanted to
make those bigger.

01:10:25.980 --> 01:10:27.950
And to make them bigger,
we thought, OK, we'll

01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:32.210
just put in like a simpler
one-lane background.

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:33.660
So that's where that came from.

01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:36.190
We were planning on doing
that before yesterday, I

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.580
mean before Monday.

01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.977
But we just didn't
have the assets in yet.

01:10:40.977 --> 01:10:43.560
So like a lot of things changed
that were already in the works

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.530
since you last saw it.

01:10:46.530 --> 01:10:47.440
Cool.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:48.616
Any other questions?

01:10:51.109 --> 01:10:52.108
Well, thank you so much.

01:10:54.976 --> 01:10:58.190
LAUREN: All right, so
we're Cholera Control.

01:10:58.190 --> 01:11:00.560
And we're going to talk a
little bit about our game

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.050
and the making of it.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:06.320
So firstly, Cholera Control is a
game we made for the Red Cross.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.402
Our client was Pablo Sanchez,
as a few others have mentioned.

01:11:10.402 --> 01:11:12.860
And the point that we wanted
to get across with our cholera

01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:16.830
game is that it is an easily
preventable disease, if you

01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:18.270
just like wash your hands.

01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:20.090
It's really not that hard.

01:11:20.090 --> 01:11:21.690
But people just
don't seem to do it,

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:24.480
because there's a lot of
factors going on in their life

01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:25.760
and they sort of just forget.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:28.720
But it's really easy to do,
if you just wash your hands.

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:33.042
So we want to just do a
quick demo of the game.

01:11:33.042 --> 01:11:35.670
Where is-- OK.

01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:39.367
So if someone would like to
come down and play our game.

01:11:39.367 --> 01:11:40.321
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:11:40.321 --> 01:11:41.280
LAUREN: Cool.

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.388
AUDIENCE: Cholera is fun.

01:11:44.388 --> 01:11:46.554
AUDIENCE: Not supposed to
show up on our home video,

01:11:46.554 --> 01:11:47.216
so that's OK.

01:11:47.216 --> 01:11:48.208
AUDIENCE: Are you hot?

01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:49.499
AUDIENCE: No, I'm just kidding.

01:11:49.499 --> 01:11:51.184
I don't know.

01:11:51.184 --> 01:11:52.672
AUDIENCE: We'll find out.

01:11:52.672 --> 01:11:54.656
Don't have any policy for that.

01:11:54.656 --> 01:11:56.640
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:57.632
Play a game.

01:12:08.048 --> 01:12:09.536
LAUREN: Can you guys read that?

01:12:09.536 --> 01:12:10.528
AUDIENCE: Yep.

01:12:10.528 --> 01:12:12.512
LAUREN: Can anyone in
the back not read it?

01:12:12.512 --> 01:12:13.054
Because, it--

01:12:13.054 --> 01:12:14.636
STUDENT: It says
cholera is spreading.

01:12:14.636 --> 01:12:16.976
You got to control it and
watch out for outbreaks.

01:12:16.976 --> 01:12:31.620
AUDIENCE: OK, I'll
just-- Oh, OK.

01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:33.090
I have $1,400?

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:34.866
LAUREN: So as you
can see, the game

01:12:34.866 --> 01:12:36.560
is kind of a strategy game.

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:40.020
Right now, there's only
one locality to deal with.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.729
We sort of didn't want to
throw too much at the player

01:12:42.729 --> 01:12:43.645
at the very beginning.

01:12:43.645 --> 01:12:46.795
So you can kind of--
also, the game is paused,

01:12:46.795 --> 01:12:48.780
so it's going to open
in that corner there.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.355
And so you can have time
to sort of just read,

01:12:51.355 --> 01:12:53.000
make sure you know
what's going on,

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.824
what all those
different things do.

01:12:55.824 --> 01:12:56.990
Then you go back to the map.

01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:58.376
And time keeps elapsing.

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:06.850
And so over time, more
localities appear, up to four.

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.997
So right now, you just
get the second one.

01:13:08.997 --> 01:13:10.830
They are on different
branches of the river.

01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:13.204
So they're not going to really
hurt each other right now,

01:13:13.204 --> 01:13:16.286
still relatively easy.

01:13:16.286 --> 01:13:18.094
STUDENT: We go cheap.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.012
LAUREN: Hopefully.

01:13:19.012 --> 01:13:20.970
I don't want to offend
anyone, if they're like,

01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:24.302
this is really hard.

01:13:24.302 --> 01:13:25.802
AUDIENCE: So the
average [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:25.802 --> 01:13:33.212
that the infection is
still growing, more so.

01:13:35.989 --> 01:13:37.780
LAUREN: So one of the
things you could see,

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:40.190
if he goes back to the
map, is all the bars

01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:43.972
above the villages, green is
the healthy and red is infected.

01:13:43.972 --> 01:13:45.430
And there's an
arrow, which I think

01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:50.890
is a-- you can see it pretty
well on there-- the arrow,

01:13:50.890 --> 01:13:53.820
if it's pointing that way, that
means that the amount of green

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:54.390
is growing.

01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:55.740
So there's more
people getting healed.

01:13:55.740 --> 01:13:57.739
If it's pointing the other
way, then more people

01:13:57.739 --> 01:13:59.440
are getting infected,
which is bad.

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.160
So if you see your
arrow switch directions,

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.000
you usually want to
get on that really

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.500
quickly and make sure that
nobody dies-- well, no, nobody

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.100
gets infected.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:12.099
Nobody dies in this game.

01:14:12.099 --> 01:14:13.390
We didn't want to be too harsh.

01:14:13.390 --> 01:14:15.362
AUDIENCE: Are the
products accumulated?

01:14:15.362 --> 01:14:16.201
So my like--

01:14:16.201 --> 01:14:18.200
STUDENT: Yes, yeah, so
if you buy more than one,

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:18.991
they work together.

01:14:18.991 --> 01:14:19.910
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.834
Ew, boiling water.

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:34.140
STUDENT: So boiling
water is special,

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:36.590
because it helps
downstream villages.

01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:39.120
AUDIENCE: I clicked that.

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:40.440
STUDENT: That doesn't help.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.432
AUDIENCE: I know.

01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:45.920
Is my budget growing?

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:46.520
STUDENT: Yes.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.792
AUDIENCE: OK, oh great.

01:14:48.792 --> 01:14:50.250
Oh, crap, I didn't
mean to do that.

01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:51.520
STUDENT: You can undo.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.362
AUDIENCE: Oh, I can?

01:14:52.362 --> 01:14:53.820
STUDENT: Yeah,
well, now you can't.

01:14:53.820 --> 01:14:54.827
AUDIENCE: Now, I can't.

01:14:54.827 --> 01:14:56.910
STUDENT: That one's going
to-- you're [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:59.670
AUDIENCE: OK, I need to buy them
boiling water, and that's it.

01:14:59.670 --> 01:15:00.544
STUDENT: You're done.

01:15:02.862 --> 01:15:03.816
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:15:03.816 --> 01:15:04.816
LAUREN: Well, thank you.

01:15:04.816 --> 01:15:05.724
STUDENT: Yep, thanks.

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:13.920
Yeah, so if you manage to
survive longer-- no offense--

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.470
you get to-- up to
four villages pop up,

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:17.920
or four localities pops up.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.090
And then it gets really hard.

01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.590
Cool.

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:28.730
Cool, so first, we're going
to talk about what went right,

01:15:28.730 --> 01:15:31.160
both from the
creation of the game

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.982
and working as a team
sort of perspective.

01:15:33.982 --> 01:15:37.030
LAUREN: So firstly, I'll
go over the iteration

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:38.530
was a lot better
on this project.

01:15:38.530 --> 01:15:41.320
In this class, we had a
total of four projects.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.304
The first three were
each over-- like,

01:15:44.304 --> 01:15:45.470
the first one was two weeks.

01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:46.460
Second one was two weeks.

01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:46.860
Third one was two weeks.

01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:48.427
And then this one
was eight weeks.

01:15:48.427 --> 01:15:50.260
So this time, we had a
lot more time to sort

01:15:50.260 --> 01:15:54.460
of decide what we wanted to
do, what we should try out,

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:57.740
and get to sort of test each and
every single one of the ideas

01:15:57.740 --> 01:16:00.740
that we had, rather
than just focusing

01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:03.890
on one idea of having to do it,
because you only had two weeks.

01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:06.799
The other thing is that
after three projects,

01:16:06.799 --> 01:16:09.340
we finally figured out how to
do design meetings really well.

01:16:09.340 --> 01:16:11.821
We got them down to that they
were only like a half hour

01:16:11.821 --> 01:16:12.320
each.

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:15.230
And when people showed up,
they were really productive.

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:18.520
And so everyone figured
out what they wanted to do.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.970
They talked about the game.

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:21.680
It got done, and people
got out of there.

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.380
It was very nice.

01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.160
Another thing we did
right was simplifying.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.540
It was really hard
to adjust scope.

01:16:29.540 --> 01:16:31.067
It was easier in
the other games,

01:16:31.067 --> 01:16:32.900
because you realize you
only have two weeks.

01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.149
When you have eight weeks,
you think you can do a lot,

01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:36.336
and you really can't.

01:16:36.336 --> 01:16:37.710
You think you have
a lot of time,

01:16:37.710 --> 01:16:41.320
but classes and
applying to jobs,

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.490
and everything takes
all of your time.

01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:45.450
And so you have to
really learn to,

01:16:45.450 --> 01:16:47.580
OK, like, I only have so
much time for this class.

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.580
I can only do so
much on this game,

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.340
so I'm going to
adjust the scope.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:55.100
And it was really hard even when
the client, when Pablo told us,

01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:57.710
you should change what you're
doing, we didn't want to.

01:16:57.710 --> 01:16:59.436
We thought, no, this
is a great idea.

01:16:59.436 --> 01:17:00.560
This is how it should work.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.490
But then when the
client tells you do it

01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:05.080
and all your play testers
say your idea is bad,

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.720
you need to just
give in and change.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.820
And we ended up having
really great results.

01:17:10.820 --> 01:17:13.340
With the simpler gameplay,
it's a lot more fun.

01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.880
And the options, there
are less options,

01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.780
but they're much
more meaningful.

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:19.350
As you could see,
the player was sort

01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:21.260
of reading through
each and every option.

01:17:21.260 --> 01:17:23.940
And it's because they each
do something different.

01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.900
Before, we had a
lot more options.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:27.980
But they were all
sort of the same.

01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:31.090
You just kind of click
them, and they do something.

01:17:31.090 --> 01:17:32.990
But they're all just
about the same effect.

01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:35.110
With this, they all
have different effects.

01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:36.800
So you sort of
have to strategize.

01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:39.100
Do I want to spend more
money for this effect?

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:42.070
Or can I just use this cheaper
effect over and over again

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:43.020
for the same result?

01:17:45.710 --> 01:17:48.290
STUDENT: So I'm going to
talk a little bit about what

01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:50.583
changed from beginning to end.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:54.920
So the UI in the beginning
looks much uglier.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.010
I mean, that just came
with sort of refining that.

01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:59.470
I want to talk a lot about
sort of the design changes

01:17:59.470 --> 01:18:00.490
that really changed.

01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:04.300
So in our first
prototype of the game,

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:07.570
you sort of click these
buttons here on the right.

01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:10.390
And that would give
you the actions.

01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:12.140
Whereas, in the final
version of the game,

01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:14.740
you click on the villages, and
that gives you the actions.

01:18:14.740 --> 01:18:16.730
And this came from
something that Pablo

01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:19.140
told us early on and really
made a big difference, which

01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:21.970
is like people that are used
to playing video games get

01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:25.400
this concept of click
action, apply to object.

01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:28.530
But we realized, both through
play testing and again

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:30.340
Pablo telling us,
that when you don't

01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:32.840
have that sort of experience,
working in a lot of videogames

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.269
and just having that
context in your head,

01:18:35.269 --> 01:18:36.560
that doesn't really make sense.

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.560
It makes much more
sense to the people

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:42.030
that we're aiming this game
for to click on the object

01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:43.900
and then choose an action.

01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:47.090
So like that inverting
of the order of things

01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:49.600
actually makes a big
difference in helping

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.510
to understand the
game and just making

01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:53.980
the whole thing smoother.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:57.190
On top of that, we
sort of like really

01:18:57.190 --> 01:18:59.639
refined the information
that we're showing

01:18:59.639 --> 01:19:00.680
when you look at the map.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.471
So right now, like in
the original version,

01:19:02.471 --> 01:19:04.025
you look at the
map and you sort of

01:19:04.025 --> 01:19:06.150
don't see straight away
everything you need to see.

01:19:06.150 --> 01:19:07.860
You need to go to
each of the villages

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:09.401
individually to know
what's going on.

01:19:09.401 --> 01:19:11.770
You sort of can only see
where each village is,

01:19:11.770 --> 01:19:15.562
or where each locality is
and how much health it has.

01:19:15.562 --> 01:19:18.020
Whereas in the final version,
we sort of give you every you

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:18.649
need to see.

01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:20.190
And it took a long
time to figure out

01:19:20.190 --> 01:19:21.356
how we wanted to do this UI.

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:23.350
Like, how do we show
what prevention measures

01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:24.190
are in place?

01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:25.690
How do we show
whether the infection

01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:27.990
is growing or decreasing?

01:19:27.990 --> 01:19:30.230
And how do we show which
way the river is flowing?

01:19:30.230 --> 01:19:32.880
All of these questions were
really important and really led

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:35.650
into the final design.

01:19:35.650 --> 01:19:38.650
Secondly, about like
options, at first we

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:40.577
had lots of options, too many.

01:19:40.577 --> 01:19:42.910
People did not even want to
figure out what each of them

01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:43.390
did.

01:19:43.390 --> 01:19:45.181
It was too much
information thrown at once.

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:47.770
And although we thought
that having lots of options

01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:49.840
would lead to meaningful--
like, oh, well,

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.110
you can make these
advanced strategies.

01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:53.151
It really didn't, because
people didn't even want

01:19:53.151 --> 01:19:54.590
to bother learning all that.

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:58.380
Whereas, in the final
version, having fewer options

01:19:58.380 --> 01:20:02.090
made it much easier or
like much less scary

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:04.520
when you opened up the list
of options, the actions

01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:06.340
that you have available
to you as a player.

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:08.560
And it was much more
accessible, while still

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:12.104
making the strategies diverse.

01:20:12.104 --> 01:20:13.770
So now, we're going
to talk a little bit

01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:17.280
about what went wrong in the
process of making the game.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:21.400
So working together
is really hard,

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.360
because people are
stepping over their toes.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.312
Oh, what do I do now.

01:20:24.312 --> 01:20:26.520
Oh, I can't touch that,
because you're touching that.

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.400
Like, all these sort
of problem arise.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.850
And so at first, we really
tried to avoid that.

01:20:30.850 --> 01:20:35.010
But then we realized working
apart is even harder than that.

01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:37.030
Initially, you think,
well, if we're each

01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:39.090
working on really sort
of independent parts

01:20:39.090 --> 01:20:40.930
and we bring it all together
in the end, that'll be happy.

01:20:40.930 --> 01:20:41.620
Everyone will be happy.

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:42.911
We're not stepping on our toes.

01:20:42.911 --> 01:20:45.820
We can each work on our own
time and that sort of thing.

01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:48.690
But that turns out not to work
well, because people do things

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:49.362
differently.

01:20:49.362 --> 01:20:51.070
People follow-- like,
even simple things,

01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:53.600
like coding style and how
you name your variables

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.700
and all that sort of
stuff makes a difference.

01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:57.560
And if you're not
working together closely,

01:20:57.560 --> 01:20:59.410
and if you sort of
working apart, bringing

01:20:59.410 --> 01:21:02.067
that together was a
huge hassle at the end.

01:21:02.067 --> 01:21:04.400
Like we spent a lot of time
just making sure everything,

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.483
all the components that
we had made as individuals

01:21:06.483 --> 01:21:09.074
worked together, just
to get the game running.

01:21:09.074 --> 01:21:10.740
LAUREN: So another
thing that went wrong

01:21:10.740 --> 01:21:12.900
was the motivation
for this project.

01:21:12.900 --> 01:21:15.020
At the very beginning,
the team wasn't

01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:17.370
very passionate about the
project to begin with,

01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:18.689
which is really hard.

01:21:18.689 --> 01:21:20.230
It's really hard to
work on something

01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:22.716
that you don't really
love and want to do.

01:21:22.716 --> 01:21:25.090
And I thought, you know, maybe
this will just get better.

01:21:25.090 --> 01:21:27.310
People will start to have ideas.

01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:29.060
They'll feel ownership
of the project.

01:21:29.060 --> 01:21:31.490
And then they'll be more
motivated to work on it.

01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:33.190
But that's not true.

01:21:33.190 --> 01:21:35.600
People, if they start
off in a bad place,

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.100
they're not going
to get any better.

01:21:37.100 --> 01:21:40.520
You really have to focus
on somehow helping people

01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:43.990
to either learn to
love the project

01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:48.230
or learn to just be
able to work on it.

01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:50.770
And this can be done
through different ways.

01:21:50.770 --> 01:21:52.320
The easiest way is
just to get people

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.320
to realize like we
have to do this,

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.560
so you have to work on it.

01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:59.690
And I found it as-- towards
the end of the semester,

01:21:59.690 --> 01:22:01.300
it took me to
figure this one out.

01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:03.350
But if you give people
vague instructions,

01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:06.010
they will wait until
the very last second.

01:22:06.010 --> 01:22:07.810
But if you make
it crystal clear,

01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:10.560
exactly what you want
them to do and give

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.950
them is as detailed
instructions you can,

01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:16.490
it's much more likely that it'll
get done in a timely manner.

01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:19.100
And also, we felt
really restricted

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:21.600
by the topic and
the requirements,

01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.160
which was another just
problem in motivation.

01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:28.680
And so crunch is something
I was sort of alluding to,

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:30.860
is that when you
have the instructions

01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:33.560
and you don't want to do
something, you will put it off.

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:34.190
I do it.

01:22:34.190 --> 01:22:38.259
I am sure everyone else does it
that I don't want to do this.

01:22:38.259 --> 01:22:40.050
I don't understand what
they want me to do,

01:22:40.050 --> 01:22:42.820
so I'm just going to wait
until the last possible second

01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:45.230
when I have to do it
or I'm going to fail.

01:22:45.230 --> 01:22:47.190
And that's when it
gets done, which

01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:49.770
is what I think was a
leading thing to our crunch.

01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:51.280
And so we had
constant crunching.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.160
Every time we knew
we had to play test,

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.950
the night before,
everyone was up working.

01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:59.675
And there was a huge
crunch after Thanksgiving.

01:22:59.675 --> 01:23:01.550
We took until Thanksgiving,
and then everyone

01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:04.605
realized we don't have that much
for longer in this semester.

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.230
We only have like a
week and three days

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:08.090
before this final presentation.

01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:10.660
So there was a lot
of crunch there.

01:23:10.660 --> 01:23:13.070
And the work was low priority
because of other classes,

01:23:13.070 --> 01:23:16.190
which is a really unique problem
to doing a school project, as

01:23:16.190 --> 01:23:18.720
opposed to doing a
project in the real world,

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.060
where people still might
have other things to do,

01:23:21.060 --> 01:23:22.272
but this is their job.

01:23:22.272 --> 01:23:24.230
Whereas, when this is a
class, you can't really

01:23:24.230 --> 01:23:25.525
fire someone from your class.

01:23:28.447 --> 01:23:30.530
Let's see, you want to
talk about what we learned?

01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:31.880
STUDENT: Yeah.

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:35.406
So what we learned in terms of
game design, at least for me

01:23:35.406 --> 01:23:38.030
and probably for everyone on the
team, what was most surprising

01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:40.930
is that giving more choices and
making a game more complicated

01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:42.310
does not make it more fun.

01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:43.940
Initially I thought,
more choices

01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:46.900
means more strategic
diversity or whatever,

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:48.700
and that'll make
everything more exciting.

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:49.600
And every time
you play the game,

01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:50.610
you can try something different.

01:23:50.610 --> 01:23:51.980
But that's not really true.

01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:54.730
Having less choices
can be even more

01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.647
fun than having more
choices, because then you

01:23:56.647 --> 01:23:58.563
don't have-- like when
the player doesn't have

01:23:58.563 --> 01:24:00.220
to think about as
much at once, they

01:24:00.220 --> 01:24:03.480
can really go deeper into
what the current options are.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.150
So that was really surprising.

01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:09.380
Also in terms of game design,
requirements can be restrictive

01:24:09.380 --> 01:24:13.570
and often you can't do
what you want to do.

01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:15.602
You as a designer can't
do what you want to do,

01:24:15.602 --> 01:24:18.060
can't fulfill your own fantasy
for what the game is opposed

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.880
to look like, because
of the requirements,

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.650
because of what clients want,
and because of what players

01:24:21.650 --> 01:24:22.240
want.

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.560
And you have to learn to
sort of deal with that.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:27.220
The designer is
not always right.

01:24:27.220 --> 01:24:29.594
Just because I have an idea
for what the game is supposed

01:24:29.594 --> 01:24:31.360
to look like, if I
test on 10 people

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.520
and all 10 people
say I don't like it,

01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:36.550
I'd prefer it to be this
way, then I'm wrong.

01:24:36.550 --> 01:24:37.484
I have to change that.

01:24:37.484 --> 01:24:39.400
And that's something
that's hard to deal with,

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.191
but it's something you
have to learn to do.

01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:46.600
Yeah, we learned a
lot about cholera.

01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.270
Basically, as we said
in one of first slides,

01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:52.030
washing hands is
overpowered in real life.

01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:54.634
If you just wash-- very simple
things can prevent cholera.

01:24:54.634 --> 01:24:57.050
And that's something we wanted
to get across in this game.

01:24:57.050 --> 01:24:59.430
In the game, washing hands
is overpowered, just so

01:24:59.430 --> 01:25:01.690
that they get that idea across.

01:25:01.690 --> 01:25:04.524
And about coding, there's
a lot of simple things

01:25:04.524 --> 01:25:06.190
you can do to really
polish up the game,

01:25:06.190 --> 01:25:09.100
like tweening, which is a
animation API available,

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.610
and Phaser that we used.

01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:13.480
But really any animation API
that does like little things,

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:15.410
like having the window
pop up instead of just

01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:19.270
appear, having things go like
"paching!" and move in and out,

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:21.894
that makes a huge difference
for very little effort.

01:25:21.894 --> 01:25:23.810
And it makes the game
look much more polished.

01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.770
In terms of future changes
for the game itself,

01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:33.734
we initially planned to
have seasons and lots

01:25:33.734 --> 01:25:36.400
of random events that would sort
of make the game more exciting,

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.650
especially near the end,
once all four villages are up

01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:41.020
and you sort of get
into this pattern.

01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:45.160
But we basically didn't
have time to do that.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.740
And then the second thing that
at least I personally wanted

01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:50.180
to add to the game was more
advanced infection models.

01:25:50.180 --> 01:25:52.566
It turns out that modeling
infection is-- well,

01:25:52.566 --> 01:25:53.690
it's not surprising really.

01:25:53.690 --> 01:25:55.400
But modeling infection
is really hard.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.910
Balancing your
model of infection

01:25:56.910 --> 01:25:58.550
is really, really hard.

01:25:58.550 --> 01:26:01.560
And it's sort of
almost impossible

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.590
to make it have this
sort of smooth curve,

01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:05.280
where it starts out
easy and then gets

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.760
sort of hard at the
end but not too hard.

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.260
Infection is
exponential in nature.

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:11.940
And that's really
hard to deal with.

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:13.324
If I had more time
to work on it,

01:26:13.324 --> 01:26:14.740
I'd probably spend
a lot more time

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:17.110
thinking about different
models to use for infection

01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:18.560
and make it easier to balance.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.850
Like right now, you change
like one little number

01:26:20.850 --> 01:26:22.560
by hardly anything,
and the game goes

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.600
from really, really easy
to completely impossible,

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:28.884
just because of the
nature of infection.

01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:31.640
LAUREN: And lastly, future
changes for the class.

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:34.380
One of things that we all
felt would be really useful

01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:38.230
is if the professors had
enforced the sprint task

01:26:38.230 --> 01:26:40.540
list, because you could
submit your sprint task list

01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:41.790
at the beginning of your week.

01:26:41.790 --> 01:26:44.820
But you never had to tell them
if you actually did everything.

01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.470
You just had another
sprint task list,

01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:49.180
which maybe if that it
was looked at carefully,

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:52.190
there might be the exact same
things two weeks in a row.

01:26:52.190 --> 01:26:56.140
But a lot of times, you
never heard anything

01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:57.090
about your progress.

01:26:57.090 --> 01:26:59.300
You just kind of
had your progress.

01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:01.270
And it wasn't until
the end that we really

01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:03.270
realized like, oh, we're
kind of far behind.

01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:04.200
We need to fix that.

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:06.310
So it would have been nice
earlier in the project

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:09.704
to have that sort of feedback,
like, hey, you should be--

01:27:09.704 --> 01:27:10.620
are these things done?

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:12.380
You should be doing more.

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:14.320
And more freedom in
choosing the topic,

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.232
like we mentioned before,
we felt really restricted.

01:27:17.232 --> 01:27:19.690
There were things we wanted to
do that we couldn't, because

01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:21.351
of the confines of this project.

01:27:21.351 --> 01:27:23.350
And so a little more
freedom would've been nice.

01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:26.590
But you know, it's a class.

01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:29.160
So finally, does anyone have
any questions or comments,

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:29.659
feedback?

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:40.890
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:42.719
What would you do
if-- what would

01:27:42.719 --> 01:27:45.010
your team have done if they
were able to choose a topic

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:47.010
or have a little
bit more freedom?

01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:49.650
Was there anything in particular
you talked about as a team?

01:27:49.650 --> 01:27:51.816
Or when you're talking about
things you wanted to do

01:27:51.816 --> 01:27:53.940
but the client said no.

01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:55.520
AUDIENCE: Humor.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:58.350
STUDENT: Yeah, in terms of like
if we were doing about cholera,

01:27:58.350 --> 01:27:59.850
things we wanted
to do about cholera

01:27:59.850 --> 01:28:03.780
but we couldn't, like
death is not in the game.

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.060
We can't make it like
overly morbid or anything,

01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:08.560
not that we-- But there
are certain things,

01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:10.730
like we wanted to
have more options.

01:28:10.730 --> 01:28:16.200
But since the game is sort of
oriented towards-- or rather,

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:18.120
the options have to be
oriented towards what

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:19.690
an individual can do.

01:28:19.690 --> 01:28:22.650
So the game is
supposed to teach kid

01:28:22.650 --> 01:28:24.620
to young adult as an
individual how can I

01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:27.510
prevent cholera, which is
like you wash your hands.

01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:29.340
You boil your water,
that sort of thing.

01:28:29.340 --> 01:28:34.410
But things like put basically
bathrooms, the sorts of things

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:38.730
that a government or the group
of people as a whole could do,

01:28:38.730 --> 01:28:40.147
but an individual
can't really do,

01:28:40.147 --> 01:28:41.813
were options that we
wanted in the game,

01:28:41.813 --> 01:28:44.100
and could have sort of
interesting mechanical effects

01:28:44.100 --> 01:28:47.820
within the game, we couldn't do,
because it doesn't make sense.

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:49.600
I can't teach you
to make bathrooms.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:51.785
You can't, not really,
as an individual.

01:28:51.785 --> 01:28:53.910
LAUREN: Yeah, and sort
of as Jen shouted out,

01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:54.940
tongue-in-cheek humor.

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:56.900
There was a lot of
time during the game

01:28:56.900 --> 01:28:58.941
where we're like, oh, we
should have this happen,

01:28:58.941 --> 01:28:59.950
but it was offensive.

01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:01.010
It was funny.

01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:03.760
It would be funny to
an American audience.

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.274
But because it was for
an audience in Ghana,

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:08.190
we changed the-- we
didn't know whether to use

01:29:08.190 --> 01:29:09.440
village or town or city.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.440
And so we asked Pablo.

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:12.180
And he said use the
word locality, which

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:14.340
to everyone playing
it, play testers,

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:16.560
we're like this is
a really weird word.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:17.800
Why does it say locality?

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.150
And even we forget to
use the word locality.

01:29:20.150 --> 01:29:22.400
And we call it a
village accidentally.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.690
And so we'd want a little
bit more freedom there

01:29:24.690 --> 01:29:27.640
and sort of make it maybe
a more humorous game.

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:29.190
But we didn't really--
we were really

01:29:29.190 --> 01:29:30.400
afraid of being offensive.

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.941
That was like one
of the first things

01:29:31.941 --> 01:29:34.009
we talked about when
we started making

01:29:34.009 --> 01:29:36.300
the game is how do we make
sure we don't offend anybody

01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:36.841
accidentally.

01:29:40.956 --> 01:29:43.920
AUDIENCE: Any other questions?

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.384
We're done?

01:29:46.384 --> 01:29:46.884
All right.

01:29:46.884 --> 01:29:47.620
LAUREN: Thank you.

01:29:47.620 --> 01:29:48.453
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:29:48.453 --> 01:29:49.166
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:29:51.993 --> 01:29:54.060
LIZ RITA: We're the
Saving Gora Gora team.

01:29:54.060 --> 01:29:57.035
I'm Liz, Rachel, Kevin, Justin.

01:29:57.035 --> 01:29:58.410
There are others
in the audience.

01:30:01.315 --> 01:30:03.800
Go to the beginning.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:04.840
Yeah.

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:11.240
So to start us off, I'm going
to talk about, let's see,

01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:15.730
the goals that we had
from the beginning.

01:30:15.730 --> 01:30:18.310
Our product is about cholera
and cholera prevention.

01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:21.060
And our audience was
Ghanaian children.

01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:25.890
So we had to find a way to
connect Ghanaian children

01:30:25.890 --> 01:30:27.820
to this information
about cholera

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:32.140
prevention, positive behaviors,
proactive things they can

01:30:32.140 --> 01:30:34.480
do in the community, while
also having a fun game

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.220
that they can relate to.

01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.486
What this ultimately
meant is that we

01:30:39.486 --> 01:30:41.110
had to do a lot of
research, because we

01:30:41.110 --> 01:30:44.190
didn't have a direct
connection with our audience.

01:30:44.190 --> 01:30:46.190
And we couldn't
directly play test

01:30:46.190 --> 01:30:49.840
with children from
Ghana, ages 8 to 13.

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:53.500
We had to make a lot of
assumptions, which ended up

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:57.000
being wrong after we talked to
Pablo, specifically about them.

01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:58.310
So we did some more research.

01:30:58.310 --> 01:31:02.820
We looked at Ghana,
cartoons targeted

01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:04.330
towards children in Ghana.

01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:09.850
And from those cartoons, we
looked at the color palettes,

01:31:09.850 --> 01:31:13.350
some behaviors within
the cartoon specifically,

01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:17.830
and names and sort of character
designs from the cartoons.

01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:22.960
And we got Ghana research
from documentaries and stuff,

01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:27.880
also informed decisions that
we used to change minigames,

01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:31.170
which we'll talk about
later in the presentation.

01:31:31.170 --> 01:31:35.186
A quick overview of the
narrative-- you start the game.

01:31:35.186 --> 01:31:36.810
There is this monster
hiding in a bush.

01:31:36.810 --> 01:31:38.070
You go to check him out.

01:31:38.070 --> 01:31:41.590
It turns out that
he's being persecuted,

01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:44.500
because everybody in
Gora Gora is sick.

01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:46.030
And they think he's the cause.

01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:49.200
And Sal is actually a cool guy.

01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:51.350
You're a bunny, and
your name is Kojo,

01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:53.500
and you're a cool guy, too.

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.250
So you're asked to prove
that he's innocent.

01:31:56.250 --> 01:32:01.170
And you take that up, because
you're an awesome person.

01:32:01.170 --> 01:32:03.500
The gameplay ends
up being that you

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:07.140
explore the town,
looking for ways

01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:09.400
to prove that Sal is innocent.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.170
And you do that by
unlocking these minigames

01:32:12.170 --> 01:32:13.810
and getting clues
from the minigames

01:32:13.810 --> 01:32:15.680
after you defeat the minigames.

01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:18.110
And after each minigame, you
can go talk to the mayor,

01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:21.667
or you have the choice to,
because he has an office.

01:32:21.667 --> 01:32:23.500
And when you have all
the clues, you finally

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:28.356
convince the mayor that Sal
is harmless, which is great.

01:32:28.356 --> 01:32:30.890
KEVIN WANG: So
our first minigame

01:32:30.890 --> 01:32:32.560
dealt with water filtration.

01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:36.190
And the concept behind it is
that friends and neighbors

01:32:36.190 --> 01:32:39.850
are bringing containers
of water to Kojo's mom.

01:32:39.850 --> 01:32:42.380
And they want to see whether
the water is safe to drink,

01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:45.650
or whether they have to purify
it beforehand by boiling.

01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:51.520
So that, and when we
initially designed our game,

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:56.330
it turned out to be water
filtration kind of factoring,

01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:59.590
in which bottles of water were
going down a conveyor belt.

01:32:59.590 --> 01:33:03.120
And you were asked to remove
the bottles that were unpurified

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:06.290
and that needed to be cleaned.

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:10.980
So as you see on the left, that
was our very first iteration.

01:33:10.980 --> 01:33:14.480
And I guess the issue with
that, as Pablo brought up to us,

01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:17.030
was that it wasn't
relatable to the kids

01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:19.800
that we were trying to target,
because these kids likely

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:23.879
won't ever see a facility that
has these conveyor belts, that

01:33:23.879 --> 01:33:25.170
does this kind of purification.

01:33:25.170 --> 01:33:28.510
So we had to go through
several iterations

01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:32.260
to figure out a way to make
the game a lot more relatable.

01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:36.260
And our final product is on the
left-- or on the right, sorry.

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:38.190
And as you can see,
it's outside one

01:33:38.190 --> 01:33:39.890
of the homes in the village.

01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:44.330
And your mom is just standing
behind a pot of boiling water.

01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:50.020
And now, you just have plain
containers, bowls, buckets,

01:33:50.020 --> 01:33:51.160
tanks.

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:54.750
And your goal is to kind of see
where the water is coming from,

01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:58.500
how warm it is, and try
to figure out whether you

01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.380
want to boil it or not.

01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:06.040
So some challenges we faced
were, in our first iteration,

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.760
it was more of a
real time game play.

01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.120
You were kind of rushing
against time to pull off

01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:14.470
all the unfiltered water,
as all the bottles continued

01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:16.120
to scroll to the
right, regardless

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:17.844
of how fast you were going.

01:34:17.844 --> 01:34:19.510
But then we realized
that took away kind

01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:22.700
of from the educational aspect,
because it forced the player

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:27.290
to just kind of hurriedly just
pull everything that they can.

01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:30.410
So instead, we changed
it to a styled gameplay

01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:33.820
that was kind of at
the player's pace.

01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:37.130
They can do everything as
fast or as slow as they want.

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:40.400
And that, I think, gives
the player a better chance

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:42.700
to kind of learn
everything there

01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:44.215
is to learn from the minigame.

01:34:47.228 --> 01:34:51.480
RACHEL WANG: Cool, so the second
minigame is a water collection

01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:54.650
game, where you're asked to help
your friend [? Korku ?] find

01:34:54.650 --> 01:34:56.830
where to collect water from.

01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:58.581
And so with this
development process,

01:34:58.581 --> 01:35:00.080
it was kind of
similar to what Kevin

01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:03.680
was saying about making it,
like have as high of a learning

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:05.610
value as possible.

01:35:05.610 --> 01:35:08.940
And then another aspect of this
game was making it fail-safe.

01:35:08.940 --> 01:35:11.100
So obviously, we thought
there was one right answer

01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:13.940
that the player should
take away from it.

01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:16.290
But we didn't want
them to fail and then

01:35:16.290 --> 01:35:19.030
not win the game at the end,
if they were to not choose

01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:20.450
the right location.

01:35:20.450 --> 01:35:23.070
So one way we dealt
with that was,

01:35:23.070 --> 01:35:26.300
every time the player chose
a wrong location, there'd

01:35:26.300 --> 01:35:29.060
be immediate feedback,
saying, oh, this

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:32.750
isn't such a good place to
collect water from because.

01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:34.580
And so as you can
see, this example

01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:36.580
is, if you were to collect
water from the river,

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:39.110
you don't know if there's
excreta from upstream

01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:42.250
or if someone's peeing
in the river right now.

01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:46.060
So then it'll ask you
to try another place.

01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:48.140
We also did a feature
cut pretty early on,

01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:50.940
which was also finding someone
to dispose of your excreta.

01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:54.880
And so we focused on the
water, which would hopefully

01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:57.460
focus the player's
attention in figuring out

01:35:57.460 --> 01:36:00.890
where to place water and really
think about the water aspect

01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:04.700
and not so much as another
aspect of the game.

01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:07.541
So the other challenge
was, as Liz and Kevin

01:36:07.541 --> 01:36:10.040
already pointed out, was there's
a huge cultural difference.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:13.630
So again, I have like a
before and after shot of what

01:36:13.630 --> 01:36:15.110
our landscape looked like.

01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:17.810
And so originally, there
was snow-capped mountains,

01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:18.810
a lot of grass.

01:36:18.810 --> 01:36:21.390
But from our research, we
saw that this didn't really

01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:23.410
look like Ghana landscape.

01:36:23.410 --> 01:36:25.160
We had a water
treatment facility,

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.710
which originally was the correct
place to collect water from.

01:36:28.710 --> 01:36:31.470
But we eventually changed
that to be a well.

01:36:31.470 --> 01:36:35.110
And so that's more
realistic in terms of where

01:36:35.110 --> 01:36:36.780
people collect water in Ghana.

01:36:36.780 --> 01:36:40.310
Additionally, at the
end there is a task bar,

01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:42.430
so it provides
you more feedback.

01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:44.020
If you clicked on
any of the buildings

01:36:44.020 --> 01:36:46.950
it'll provide you feedback
about what that place is,

01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:49.132
and whether or not you
should or shouldn't

01:36:49.132 --> 01:36:50.506
be placing water there.

01:36:53.282 --> 01:36:54.740
JUSTIN MARTINEZ:
Our final minigame

01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:58.400
is focused around teaching
the symptoms of cholera

01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.510
and the importance
of early prevention

01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:02.620
and recognizing the
early signs of cholera

01:37:02.620 --> 01:37:05.210
to prevent the disease
from spreading.

01:37:05.210 --> 01:37:07.680
So the premise of this game
is that the doctor in the town

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:08.280
is very busy.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.988
He can't go out into
the town to actually

01:37:09.988 --> 01:37:12.300
check on patients to see
if they're seeing any

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.910
of the early signs of cholera.

01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:17.170
So he asks you to help him
by going out and talking

01:37:17.170 --> 01:37:19.690
to some of your friends in
town, and then asking them

01:37:19.690 --> 01:37:21.430
if they're having
any of the symptoms,

01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:23.221
and then ask them to
come in to the doctor.

01:37:25.510 --> 01:37:27.689
We initially started
off by having

01:37:27.689 --> 01:37:30.230
this game be a game where you
help the doctor in the doctor's

01:37:30.230 --> 01:37:30.774
office.

01:37:30.774 --> 01:37:32.440
And he's diagnosing
patients, and you're

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.360
sort of diagnosing
the patients with him.

01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:35.984
And we realized that
this would quickly

01:37:35.984 --> 01:37:37.820
turn into sort of a
quiz-type of game,

01:37:37.820 --> 01:37:40.284
and it would really detract
from the learning aspect.

01:37:40.284 --> 01:37:42.825
It would essentially the same
as just reading the systems out

01:37:42.825 --> 01:37:43.980
of a pamphlet.

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:47.010
So we decided that by adding
more interactivity by forcing

01:37:47.010 --> 01:37:49.070
the player to go
out into the village

01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:51.200
and actually find
people and talk to them

01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.770
and then ask them to
come to the clinic

01:37:53.770 --> 01:37:56.080
would be a lot more engaging,
while still maintaining

01:37:56.080 --> 01:37:58.870
the same educational aspect
about trying to search

01:37:58.870 --> 01:38:00.790
for the right symptoms.

01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:04.240
Additionally, we
made a change where

01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:07.880
we had the player go talk to
some of the villagers that

01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:08.940
were adults.

01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.160
And then we realized that--
after speaking with Pablo,

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.930
that the social
hierarchy in Ghana

01:38:13.930 --> 01:38:16.680
is not necessarily that
of the United States.

01:38:16.680 --> 01:38:19.360
And this sort of
interaction, where

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.730
a child asks something or
sort of demands something

01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:23.280
of an adult, isn't
really something

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:25.470
that would happen, just
because of the stricter

01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:26.230
social hierarchy.

01:38:26.230 --> 01:38:28.660
So we decided that it'd
be more appropriate if we

01:38:28.660 --> 01:38:31.140
had the child go talk
to some of his friends

01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:32.460
that were of the same age.

01:38:32.460 --> 01:38:34.362
And then tell
them, since they're

01:38:34.362 --> 01:38:37.970
on the same sort of level,
to go to the doctor's office,

01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:40.734
rather than talking to elders.

01:38:40.734 --> 01:38:42.150
Some of the
challenges that we saw

01:38:42.150 --> 01:38:45.520
were that this game is
heavily dialogue-based.

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:50.460
It's almost entirely interacting
through our dialogue UI.

01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:53.290
And so we needed to do a lot
of iteration on that in order

01:38:53.290 --> 01:38:55.720
to make sure that it was
clear who was speaking

01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:59.422
and give the appropriate choices
so that the player can make

01:38:59.422 --> 01:39:01.760
meaningful decisions while
having his interactions

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.000
with the villagers.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.410
And finally, since it
is so dialogue-heavy,

01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:08.026
there's a problem that comes
when making a game for children

01:39:08.026 --> 01:39:10.150
when you have a lot of
text, because they might not

01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:11.440
be the strongest reader.

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.170
So we focused w
lot on making sure

01:39:13.170 --> 01:39:15.280
that the vocabulary
was simple, and we

01:39:15.280 --> 01:39:17.505
tried to keep the sentence
structure as simple

01:39:17.505 --> 01:39:18.990
as possible, and
straightforward,

01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:20.630
to get the message
across to children.

01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:25.330
So some of the
overall challenges

01:39:25.330 --> 01:39:27.450
that we faced while doing
the game development

01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:29.740
was mastering the
states with Phaser.

01:39:29.740 --> 01:39:31.940
This is sort of an intricacy
of the Phaser engine

01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:35.530
itself, where when you spawn
off the different stages

01:39:35.530 --> 01:39:38.310
of the map, making sure
that we can maintain

01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:41.400
the data across all
these different states,

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:44.650
so that there can be a sort
of progress through the game.

01:39:44.650 --> 01:39:47.330
And finally, we want to make
sure that the game wasn't

01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:50.480
too difficult. For example,
with the facility game

01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:53.000
at the beginning when we had
the very fast-paced clicking,

01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:54.833
and then you would fail
almost all the time.

01:39:54.833 --> 01:39:57.140
We wanted to make sure that
it wasn't too difficult,

01:39:57.140 --> 01:39:59.374
and that it was accessible.

01:39:59.374 --> 01:40:01.040
The cultural disconnect
we touched a bit

01:40:01.040 --> 01:40:03.260
on in some of our
previous games,

01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:06.000
making sure that the
target audience will

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:07.890
be able to play this
game and relate to it

01:40:07.890 --> 01:40:10.050
in order to pull
the message from it,

01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:11.500
and making the play meaningful.

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:14.640
We wanted to make sure that
the game play was still

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:16.950
getting the message across,
and finding a good balance

01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:20.148
between education and play.

01:40:20.148 --> 01:40:21.620
RACHEL WANG: So
now I'll talk about

01:40:21.620 --> 01:40:23.410
how our teamwork
worked out, and what

01:40:23.410 --> 01:40:25.130
our process like as a team.

01:40:25.130 --> 01:40:27.290
So we used four main tools.

01:40:27.290 --> 01:40:30.370
The first one being Trello,
to keep track of our tasks

01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:31.100
and progresses.

01:40:31.100 --> 01:40:34.270
So, we'd put all our sprint
task lists, our product backlog,

01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:35.275
on to the Trello.

01:40:35.275 --> 01:40:36.900
People would claim
the different tasks,

01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:39.050
and then be able to say
if they were doing them,

01:40:39.050 --> 01:40:41.340
if they were done, or
if they haven't started.

01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:43.050
And then that means
we could track

01:40:43.050 --> 01:40:45.670
how people's progress was.

01:40:45.670 --> 01:40:47.200
The second one was
weekly meetings.

01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.560
So, every week we had
a meeting to either do

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:52.710
some research about Ghana,
talk about how we could improve

01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:54.820
the game play and make
it more meaningful,

01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:57.140
if we should cut some
features, and whatnot.

01:40:57.140 --> 01:41:00.740
So, these meetings were really
great for quick and efficient

01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:03.590
decisions, and also really
important decisions.

01:41:03.590 --> 01:41:06.755
Our third tool was Slack, which
some other teams talked about.

01:41:06.755 --> 01:41:10.470
But it was really great because,
first, they had Google Drive

01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:13.590
integration, so you could see
when people were pushing code

01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:15.417
if you should be pulling code.

01:41:15.417 --> 01:41:17.750
And then, in addition, we
could have different channels.

01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:20.170
So we had a separate
coding channel,

01:41:20.170 --> 01:41:23.510
where all the coders
could talk to each other,

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:26.000
and that might not be
relevant to other people.

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:27.960
And then having a
whole team channel

01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.460
was also efficient,
because it would

01:41:29.460 --> 01:41:32.374
be faster response than email.

01:41:32.374 --> 01:41:34.040
And then our final
one was Google Drive,

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:36.180
which is where we
have all our assets,

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:38.406
had all our dialogues,
our characters.

01:41:38.406 --> 01:41:40.280
And this worked out to
be a really great tool

01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:43.830
for collaborative storage.

01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:46.770
Some downfalls of
this was-- I'll

01:41:46.770 --> 01:41:50.874
talk about the second
part, was basically

01:41:50.874 --> 01:41:53.290
with all these tools you need
to make sure that everyone's

01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:54.390
actually using the tools.

01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:56.860
It's not actually effective
to be using Trello

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:58.455
if not everyone's using Trello.

01:41:58.455 --> 01:41:59.840
And we found this
to be the case,

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:02.340
not everyone would be updating
their progress on Trello,

01:42:02.340 --> 01:42:04.460
or not everyone
would be on Slack .

01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:05.950
But some mitigations
we had to that

01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:08.180
is, in like Slack, you can
mention people's names,

01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:09.555
and then it'll
send them an email

01:42:09.555 --> 01:42:13.330
if they're not actually
on Slack at that time.

01:42:13.330 --> 01:42:15.920
We did have to remind people
to be updating the Trello board

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:18.970
or updating their progress
in Slack, or just ping

01:42:18.970 --> 01:42:20.880
people individually in email.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.002
But I think we worked it out.

01:42:23.002 --> 01:42:24.460
Something we could
have improved on

01:42:24.460 --> 01:42:27.900
was enforcing deadlines,
and having deadlines.

01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:31.550
As Kevin will talk about, we had
different roles between coding

01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:32.770
and art designing.

01:42:32.770 --> 01:42:35.370
So, obviously the
art assets had to be

01:42:35.370 --> 01:42:38.020
done before you could really
code things and put it

01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:39.000
into the game.

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:42.170
So in that aspect, we
should have probably

01:42:42.170 --> 01:42:44.830
had clearer deadlines
so that we could

01:42:44.830 --> 01:42:47.950
stick to a stricter schedule.

01:42:47.950 --> 01:42:50.610
And then, in addition,
we should have probably

01:42:50.610 --> 01:42:53.250
had a bit more
frequent communication

01:42:53.250 --> 01:42:54.520
with the entire team.

01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.220
So we did have a lot
of communication,

01:42:56.220 --> 01:42:58.840
but sometimes not all the
team members were present,

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.390
and we should have
probably improved

01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:03.610
a bit about sending
out meeting notes

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:06.140
and catching up people who
weren't at the meetings

01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:08.860
when we made certain decisions.

01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:11.780
And to that regard,
something that we could just

01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:14.730
do for next time is,
send out meeting notes,

01:43:14.730 --> 01:43:16.990
and keep everyone up
to date, and possibly

01:43:16.990 --> 01:43:21.060
even have smaller meetings
where not everyone is present.

01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:22.990
So I guess in terms of
what went right, Kevin

01:43:22.990 --> 01:43:23.940
will talk about that.

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:25.900
KEVIN WANG: So, as
Rachel was saying,

01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:29.380
we separated a lot of the tasks
of the project between the team

01:43:29.380 --> 01:43:29.880
members.

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:33.740
And since we had
seven people, we

01:43:33.740 --> 01:43:36.970
designated four to coding,
two to design and art,

01:43:36.970 --> 01:43:38.950
and then a few others
to the other aspects

01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:43.010
such as narrative, project
management, and sound.

01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:45.230
So, that actually
helped us a lot,

01:43:45.230 --> 01:43:49.010
in that having only four
coders rather than seven really

01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:52.540
cut down on the number of
merge conflicts and issues

01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:55.590
that we had in
previous projects.

01:43:55.590 --> 01:43:57.220
Because, obviously,
the fewer number

01:43:57.220 --> 01:44:00.010
of people working on each
file, the less likely

01:44:00.010 --> 01:44:01.885
it's all going to
break when people merge

01:44:01.885 --> 01:44:04.216
their stuff together in GitHub.

01:44:04.216 --> 01:44:05.840
And with the art
designers, it actually

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:07.260
helped to have just two.

01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:10.150
Because, although they
had to do more work,

01:44:10.150 --> 01:44:12.570
it was easier for them to
collaborate and make sure

01:44:12.570 --> 01:44:15.810
that all of their art followed
the same theme, rather than

01:44:15.810 --> 01:44:17.880
coming from three or four
different sources that

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:19.790
look slightly different.

01:44:19.790 --> 01:44:23.050
Eduardo and Liz were very
capable in making sure

01:44:23.050 --> 01:44:26.150
that all the art had the
same kind of color palate,

01:44:26.150 --> 01:44:27.700
and the same kind
of cultural theme

01:44:27.700 --> 01:44:32.070
to it, which helped, I think,
unify our game in the end.

01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:36.260
And, as Rachel also said, we had
semi-frequent meetings, mostly

01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:38.780
at the end of the weeks,
just to catch up and see

01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:41.040
how everybody was
doing on their parts,

01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:44.240
and what we were planning
on doing for the next week.

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.320
And it also served
as a good time for us

01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.130
to really sit down and
get some work done,

01:44:48.130 --> 01:44:52.850
whether it's drawing some new
assets, coding a new minigame.

01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:56.110
And having most of the people
there together at the same time

01:44:56.110 --> 01:44:58.420
allowed us to really
bounce ideas off each other

01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:00.480
when we were implementing
this, which made

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:02.110
things a lot more efficient.

01:45:02.110 --> 01:45:06.400
And lastly, we realize
that at the beginning,

01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:09.930
we had probably more
than we could take on

01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:11.390
over this eight-week period.

01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:14.910
So we did a good job of
cutting features early.

01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:17.440
And the main one we did was
cutting the fourth minigame out

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:20.510
of our game entirely,
so that we could really

01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:22.920
focus on making the three
minigames that we have

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:28.029
currently really robust and
really relevant to the ideas

01:45:28.029 --> 01:45:29.070
we were trying to convey.

01:45:31.662 --> 01:45:35.490
RACHEL WANG: So moving forward
from this where hopefully we

01:45:35.490 --> 01:45:38.270
would be able to find more
of our target audience,

01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:39.925
our focus tests helped
a lot whether it

01:45:39.925 --> 01:45:43.550
was speaking to Pablo, other MIT
students, people in the class.

01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:45.960
They gave us a lot of good
feedback about the game.

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:48.670
But obviously we
didn't get a chance

01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:52.520
to speak with Ghanaian kids,
which is our target audience.

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:55.830
And that could definitely
help if we had a longer period

01:45:55.830 --> 01:46:00.130
and were able to find
even kids ages 8 to 13.

01:46:00.130 --> 01:46:03.020
In terms of iteration,
I think we could still

01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.670
focus a bit more on
balancing the difficulty.

01:46:05.670 --> 01:46:08.130
And then we mitigated
that by doing things

01:46:08.130 --> 01:46:13.330
like what Justin said about
changing the text dialogue,

01:46:13.330 --> 01:46:16.460
and also providing a lot of
help tutorials or instructions

01:46:16.460 --> 01:46:17.439
throughout the game.

01:46:17.439 --> 01:46:19.480
But that's something we
could always think about,

01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:22.390
so that even kids younger
than our target audience

01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:24.650
could access the game.

01:46:24.650 --> 01:46:26.480
And then, obviously,
just making sure

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.000
the game is culturally relevant,
thinking about word choices,

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.530
thinking about assets, something
we could always improve on.

01:46:35.530 --> 01:46:38.370
And then, finally, to actually
keep moving forward we

01:46:38.370 --> 01:46:40.170
could implement
another minigame,

01:46:40.170 --> 01:46:42.010
find out other
things about cholera

01:46:42.010 --> 01:46:44.620
we really want to get across,
and add other adventures

01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:46.040
to the game.

01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:50.290
But the game right now is
pretty contained, and gives,

01:46:50.290 --> 01:46:52.850
we think, three valuable
lessons about cholera,

01:46:52.850 --> 01:46:55.360
and three very concrete
preventative actions

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.520
that you can take,
and bring back

01:46:57.520 --> 01:47:00.579
to your village and your family.

01:47:00.579 --> 01:47:02.370
So I guess that's what
we would think about

01:47:02.370 --> 01:47:03.620
if we were going to go for it.

01:47:03.620 --> 01:47:07.819
And now, we'll
move into our demo.

01:47:07.819 --> 01:47:09.360
So, I guess, if
there's any questions

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:14.945
first we can take those, or else
we'll be looking for a demo-er.

01:47:14.945 --> 01:47:18.130
AUDIENCE: I have a
question regarding

01:47:18.130 --> 01:47:21.140
how you used like the
structure of like having

01:47:21.140 --> 01:47:23.890
the many minigames
inside of a big game.

01:47:23.890 --> 01:47:28.390
I wonder like does that
help splitting the tasks up

01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:30.224
among different
members in the team

01:47:30.224 --> 01:47:31.390
and make the process better?

01:47:31.390 --> 01:47:34.890
Or did that add more difficulty
to finish all the contents

01:47:34.890 --> 01:47:37.699
and correctly tie them together?

01:47:37.699 --> 01:47:39.990
RACHEL WANG: Yes, really, I
think the modularity really

01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:44.470
helps, so the three of us took
the lead on one minigame each.

01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:46.840
But then obviously
there were components

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:49.910
that cross all the
different minigames.

01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:51.850
So, for example, our
other coder worked a lot

01:47:51.850 --> 01:47:53.930
on the conversation
and dialogue UI that

01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:55.750
shows up in all the minigames.

01:47:55.750 --> 01:47:57.271
And additionally,
at the beginning

01:47:57.271 --> 01:47:59.020
we did run into an
issue where we thought,

01:47:59.020 --> 01:48:01.630
oh, really the game is
just three minigames.

01:48:01.630 --> 01:48:03.680
So we worked to
come up with an idea

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:05.030
to tie everything together.

01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:08.290
And that ended up being an
inventory clue kind of thing.

01:48:08.290 --> 01:48:11.120
So you could go around town
looking for clues that you

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:13.340
needed to unlock the minigames.

01:48:13.340 --> 01:48:15.820
So, for example, to play the
water collection game you

01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:17.540
need a bowl to
collect the water.

01:48:17.540 --> 01:48:19.284
So you would go
around town and find

01:48:19.284 --> 01:48:21.950
someone-- maybe someone was like
wearing a bucket on their head.

01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:24.580
And you'd be able to collect
that bucket from them

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:25.890
and then play the game.

01:48:25.890 --> 01:48:28.760
So, in that sense, we
were able to come up

01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:31.590
with this idea that
could tie together

01:48:31.590 --> 01:48:32.989
all the different minigames.

01:48:32.989 --> 01:48:34.280
Does that answer your question?

01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:39.110
AUDIENCE: Is its mother a cat?

01:48:39.110 --> 01:48:41.996
LIZ RITA: Yes, [? Bunnykins' ?]
mother is a cat.

01:48:41.996 --> 01:48:44.401
AUDIENCE: All right. [INAUDIBLE]

01:48:44.401 --> 01:48:46.806
[LAUGHTER]

01:48:46.806 --> 01:48:49.320
AUDIENCE: So, you cut
the minigame number four?

01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:50.195
JUSTIN MARTINEZ: Yes.

01:48:50.195 --> 01:48:52.361
AUDIENCE: About when in the
project did you do that?

01:48:52.361 --> 01:48:54.080
And about how much
work had you actually

01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:56.680
put in to that minigame before
you decided not to complete it?

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:58.784
JUSTIN MARTINEZ: That
game did not make it

01:48:58.784 --> 01:49:01.712
past the paper prototype.

01:49:01.712 --> 01:49:03.400
After we did the
paper prototype,

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:07.150
we realized that, that
game and the symptoms game

01:49:07.150 --> 01:49:08.640
were actually very similar.

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:11.840
And so we [? introduced ?] some
or the storytelling aspects

01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:15.397
into the doctor
minigame that we pulled

01:49:15.397 --> 01:49:16.438
from the fourth minigame.

01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:21.408
PROFESSOR 1: Thank you.

01:49:21.408 --> 01:49:25.900
[APPLAUSE]

01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:27.875
[INAUDIBLE] will volunteer.

01:49:27.875 --> 01:49:29.045
Thank you.

01:50:10.020 --> 01:50:11.900
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:12.900
AUDIENCE: I sure helped!

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:16.876
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:38.423 --> 01:50:40.006
From our previous
discussion, I wonder

01:50:40.006 --> 01:50:41.870
if I can take his bucket.

01:50:41.870 --> 01:50:45.940
LIZ RITA: [INAUDIBLE]
like, go closer.

01:50:45.940 --> 01:50:47.050
AUDIENCE: Oh, gosh.

01:50:57.874 --> 01:51:00.334
I don't know if [? Korku's ?]
is going to get that bucket.

01:51:00.334 --> 01:51:02.302
Maybe I'll keep it.

01:51:08.700 --> 01:51:10.475
Wow, I already have two quests.

01:51:10.475 --> 01:51:12.800
[LAUGHTER]

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:23.195
[LAUGHTER]

01:51:27.650 --> 01:51:30.125
Never play with
fire by yourself.

01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:36.560
[LAUGHTER]

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:45.040
Whoa, look it's
turned into a cat.

01:51:45.040 --> 01:51:46.956
[LAUGHTER]

01:51:48.872 --> 01:51:49.830
Ah, cool.

01:51:55.110 --> 01:51:57.682
I mean, if I say no, I should
come back later, don't I?

01:51:57.682 --> 01:51:59.570
[LAUGHTER]

01:51:59.570 --> 01:52:02.150
Thank the bowl, and click
me when you're done.

01:52:02.150 --> 01:52:03.180
All right.

01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:07.180
Well, I know where to go,
but we'll do this anyway.

01:52:07.180 --> 01:52:09.070
There's no water there!

01:52:09.070 --> 01:52:10.610
I guess that makes sense.

01:52:10.610 --> 01:52:13.400
If there was water in the house,
I wouldn't need the bucket.

01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:15.220
I do all the wrong things first.

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:19.980
It looks like there are a
lot of bacteria in the lake.

01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:21.240
I have really good eyes.

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:23.200
[LAUGHTER]

01:52:28.100 --> 01:52:30.055
You-- I don't want rusty water.

01:52:33.319 --> 01:52:35.485
Oh, the bathroom, that's a
great place to get water.

01:52:35.485 --> 01:52:37.385
I won't go there.

01:52:41.670 --> 01:52:42.780
Yay!

01:52:42.780 --> 01:52:45.530
I have water.

01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:47.258
Can I go swimming?

01:52:47.258 --> 01:52:48.650
Yes, yes, I can.

01:52:51.900 --> 01:52:53.020
I forget what you wanted.

01:52:53.020 --> 01:52:54.020
What did you want again?

01:52:57.031 --> 01:52:57.530
Paper.

01:53:06.626 --> 01:53:09.061
I know-- no, I don't actually.

01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:14.056
Oh, I guess I do know something.

01:53:14.056 --> 01:53:14.556
Ah ha!

01:53:17.544 --> 01:53:22.524
[LAUGHTER]

01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:04.854
I guess I need to go
in the houses now.

01:54:04.854 --> 01:54:05.520
That's my guess.

01:54:08.836 --> 01:54:09.336
Oh, cool.

01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:27.676
You-- I better boil that.

01:54:27.676 --> 01:54:30.172
RACHEL WANG: You might want
to start the game first.

01:54:30.172 --> 01:54:31.710
AUDIENCE: Oh, start the game.

01:54:31.710 --> 01:54:32.710
I'll do that first.

01:54:36.495 --> 01:54:37.245
I like this water.

01:54:37.245 --> 01:54:38.055
This is great.

01:54:42.020 --> 01:54:44.540
I just know that the well is
good, because I was just there.

01:54:51.982 --> 01:54:54.065
Pump and clear, well, rust
was the problem before,

01:54:54.065 --> 01:55:01.434
so where am I getting this
hot water from the pump?

01:55:06.210 --> 01:55:06.860
Discolored.

01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:07.400
Discolored.

01:55:07.400 --> 01:55:10.110
Well, I am going to
be safe, because I

01:55:10.110 --> 01:55:11.360
don't have to gather firewood.

01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:32.645
I'm running out of firewood.

01:55:32.645 --> 01:55:34.145
Now I'm going to
be in trouble here.

01:55:45.954 --> 01:55:46.620
We'll go for it.

01:55:50.074 --> 01:55:51.740
It's from the pump,
how bad could it be?

01:55:51.740 --> 01:55:55.184
[LAUGHTER]

01:55:55.184 --> 01:55:56.660
AUDIENCE: Is this
the rusty pump?

01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:55:58.140 --> 01:55:59.570
AUDIENCE: Oh, right.

01:55:59.570 --> 01:56:00.890
That's the bad stuff.

01:56:00.890 --> 01:56:02.120
The well's the good stuff.

01:56:05.530 --> 01:56:06.842
Oh, that's [INAUDIBLE] pump.

01:56:06.842 --> 01:56:07.568
Ah, whatever.

01:56:07.568 --> 01:56:09.359
AUDIENCE: It is the
cholera that you've got

01:56:09.359 --> 01:56:10.525
to test in this game, right?

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:17.120
AUDIENCE: Hm, I only
have three firewood.

01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:17.920
Let's just do this.

01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:20.160
One of the next one
will be clear, I'm sure.

01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:20.981
Well and clear.

01:56:20.981 --> 01:56:21.480
There we go.

01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:22.771
We'll boil the rest to be safe.

01:56:28.020 --> 01:56:28.520
All right.

01:56:37.398 --> 01:56:39.511
Throwing up and have
diarrhea and very thirsty.

01:56:39.511 --> 01:56:40.010
Oh.

01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.800
So in other words,
you've seen the monster.

01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:56.050
You should go see the
doctor, because you

01:56:56.050 --> 01:56:57.049
have all those symptoms.

01:56:59.755 --> 01:57:00.255
All right.

01:57:00.255 --> 01:57:01.836
Where are my check marks?

01:57:01.836 --> 01:57:02.960
Oh, look I got three clues.

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.769
Is that good enough?

01:57:04.769 --> 01:57:05.685
Let's go out to mayor.

01:57:08.866 --> 01:57:11.490
I don't have any more spaces for
clues, it must be good enough.

01:57:16.450 --> 01:57:16.950
Nope.

01:57:55.716 --> 01:57:58.698
LIZ RITA: [INAUDIBLE]

01:57:58.698 --> 01:58:03.668
[LAUGHTER]

01:58:12.042 --> 01:58:12.625
AUDIENCE: Yay!

01:58:15.572 --> 01:58:17.280
LIZ RITA: I just jumped
over that office.

01:58:26.863 --> 01:58:28.988
AUDIENCE: I guess the
repetition's not a bad thing,

01:58:28.988 --> 01:58:30.480
is it, for your demographic?

01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:30.980
That's good.

01:58:40.442 --> 01:58:43.928
[LAUGHTER]

01:58:43.928 --> 01:58:44.922
PROFESSOR 1: That's it.

01:58:44.922 --> 01:58:45.422
Thank you.

01:58:54.215 --> 01:58:56.340
RACHEL WANG: I think that's
it, that's all we have.

01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:57.840
Are there any last questions?

01:58:57.840 --> 01:59:00.840
PROFESSOR 2: I actually do have
one question about the music.

01:59:00.840 --> 01:59:02.840
Because you have
it on the credits.

01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:05.694
Is this like a piece that
the person wrote for you?

01:59:05.694 --> 01:59:08.110
Or is this something that you
downloaded from the website?

01:59:08.110 --> 01:59:10.090
RACHEL WANG: We downloaded it.

01:59:10.090 --> 01:59:12.707
PROFESSOR 2: You might just
want to check their website

01:59:12.707 --> 01:59:15.040
to see exactly how they want
to be credited. [INAUDIBLE]

01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:17.515
title of the song they want
used, or something like that.

01:59:17.515 --> 01:59:20.980
But if you've already
done that, that's good.

01:59:20.980 --> 01:59:22.460
PROFESSOR 1: Great.

01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:22.960
Thank you.

01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:23.950
RACHEL WANG: Thank you.

01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:27.415
[APPLAUSE]

01:59:27.415 --> 01:59:28.430
PROFESSOR 1: All right.

01:59:28.430 --> 01:59:29.365
We're done!

01:59:29.365 --> 01:59:30.115
Thank you so much.

01:59:30.115 --> 01:59:36.252
[APPLAUSE]

01:59:36.252 --> 01:59:38.290
We really enjoy teaching
this class every year.

01:59:38.290 --> 01:59:41.395
We really hope you got a
good experience for it.

01:59:41.395 --> 01:59:43.145
I liked seeing a lot
of the presentations,

01:59:43.145 --> 01:59:46.630
and I liked the changes that we
saw from rehearsals to today.

01:59:46.630 --> 01:59:49.610
So there was a lot of really
good information in there,

01:59:49.610 --> 01:59:54.180
both in the games and
in the presentations.

01:59:54.180 --> 01:59:57.150
Again, if you have any
questions about future classes--

01:59:57.150 --> 01:59:59.650
we don't actually offer a
game design degree at MIT,

01:59:59.650 --> 02:00:02.150
but we do have a concentration
of comparative media studies.

02:00:02.150 --> 02:00:04.540
If you take any
four CMS classes,

02:00:04.540 --> 02:00:05.850
you get a concentration.

02:00:05.850 --> 02:00:08.590
It can be from this list here.

02:00:08.590 --> 02:00:10.780
There's information on your
desks about other things

02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:12.547
you can do with games at MIT.

02:00:12.547 --> 02:00:14.880
Course six students, if you're
interested in doing UAPs,

02:00:14.880 --> 02:00:16.500
if you haven't
thought about that,

02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:18.930
start thinking about that now.

02:00:18.930 --> 02:00:20.950
We could help with
mentoring and advising

02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:23.940
on UAP projects and
other kinds of research.

02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:26.320
And I'd like to give a
thanks to the instructors,

02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:29.285
Phillip, Sara, Andrew,
for all your help

02:00:29.285 --> 02:00:30.660
with running the
class this year.

02:00:30.660 --> 02:00:31.560
So, thanks again.

02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:32.518
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Rick.

02:00:32.518 --> 02:00:33.710
[APPLAUSE]

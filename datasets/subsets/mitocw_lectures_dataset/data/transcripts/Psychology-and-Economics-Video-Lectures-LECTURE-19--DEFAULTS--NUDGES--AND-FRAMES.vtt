FRANK SCHILBACH: All right.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.980
I'm going to get started.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.100
This is lecture 19, of 14.13.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.600
I'm going to finish up
some of what we discussed

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.230
last time on gender
discrimination and identity

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:26.010
And then we're going to talk
about nudges and default

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.720
effects.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.370
So let me sort of fairly
quickly go through the remaining

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.300
slides of lecture 18, and then
move to the lecture slides.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.990
So remember, we talked
last time about the study

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.230
by Bertrand et al. about
gender identity norms,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.750
where we talked about because--

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.820
so the authors argue there's
this norm that some men

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.550
perceive-- and perhaps
even some women--

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.430
that men should be earning
more than their wives.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.670
There's this cliff-- this
missing mass of households

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.950
or couples in the US.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.220
We talked about different
reasons for that.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.540
Missing couples that don't
form in the first place.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.310
Such marriages and couples
are less happy and stable,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.470
so they end up in divorce.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.470
And there's also,
even for existing

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.050
couples that form, whether
the wife or the woman

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.990
has more earnings potential.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.750
In some cases, at
least, women tend

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.070
to either work less few hours,
and therefore perhaps that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.690
was promoted and the like.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.110
And in addition, they
might be involved in more

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.830
nonmarket and childcare work.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.200
It's called the second shift.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.320
They have to do more work
because the husband is very

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.600
unhappy about her earning more.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.770
Which then, of course,
holds potentially

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.680
the wife back at her work.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.200
Now, somebody was
asking last time--

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.250
I believe Justin or
others-- about the arrival

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.715
of children and the gender gap.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:00.590
So there's quite a few
studies like this one.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.240
So out of this here,
which is the study

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.250
by Kleven et al. in Denmark.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.890
And these studies
essentially show

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.020
there is a substantial what they
call child penalty for women,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.380
which is when you look at
men's and women's earnings.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.250
On the left-hand side, there's
a figure shows earnings.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.450
This is yearly data over time.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.000
On the right-hand side,
you see hours worked.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.040
Similarly, you see productivity.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.380
But essentially, you tend
to see is that for men--

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.730
this is the gray
bar here on top--

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.120
you see essentially
before the child is born,

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.980
you match men and women to
have sort of similar earnings,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.640
the trajectory would
look very similar.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.260
And then, for men,
perhaps there's

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.160
a slight decline or no further
for the increase over time.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.130
But for women, there's a
clear drop in earnings.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.340
And that drop persists
for many, many years.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.450
So it's not just like
there's a year after birth,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.150
there's lower earnings
for, on average, women.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.550
But there's a
persistent gap overall

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.980
that has to be presumably
with some women

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.450
never returning back to work,
some women remaining part time,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.390
just some women working a few
hours when they have children.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.060
Notice that that's not
just about hours worked.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.980
So when you look at
the earnings gap,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.500
it's about something like 20%.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.090
The long-run child
penalty here is like 20%.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.530
It's also, for
hours worked, it's

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.610
something like 10%, which
must mean that there's

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.200
an additional 10% coming
from productivity or wages

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.940
conditional on hours worked.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.180
So it's not only that women
are working fewer hours,

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.000
but they're also paid less
per hour, which presumably

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.790
is once people start working
few hours, take more breaks,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.070
or just take a break
for a few years,

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.490
that they're getting less
promotions and so on.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.980
And that sort of carries
through for a long time.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.410
Now, interestingly, some of
these child penalties are

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.180
transmitted through
generations--

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.422
meaning from parents
to daughters--

00:03:58.422 --> 00:04:00.380
suggesting that essentially,
in the same family

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.650
where there is child
penalties from the parents--

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.520
as in the woman that
is a childcare penalty

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.640
for the mother, the
daughter will also

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.730
be likely to have a
child penalty later on.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.630
Like, 20, 30 years once
she's been actually working.

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.660
So there seems to be
something to do with the child

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.080
environment and gender
identity, which is the norm

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.960
that the woman is supposed
to take care of the children,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.850
versus the husband is not.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.830
And that seems to be sort of
permitted through generations

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.680
in the child environment.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.960
Now, you might sort of say,
well, then, couldn't we

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.340
just do some policies that
support women or support

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.910
parents to help them deal
with children better?

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.520
And wouldn't that help?

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.590
And there's some policies
that people have done.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.090
In particular, in academia,
you might say, well,

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.020
if a woman has a child or a
couple as a child in general,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.620
that's surely a hint
to productivity.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.078
And so therefore, one could
say, well, that's [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:06.078 --> 00:05:07.870
That's in fact what
people have been doing,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.640
is sort of, let's stop people's
tenure clock which essentially

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.140
is an assistant professor.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.600
People have something
like 7, 8, 9 years

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.610
to do this research
until tenure.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.980
You might say, let's
give people another year

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.710
if they have a child.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.210
Now, one proposal is to have
gender neutral clock stopping

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.290
policies.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.460
Now, these policies are intended
to involve these gender neutral

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:37.090
policies, meaning that both
parents, regardless of who's

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.935
giving-- or not just
the person who's

00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:41.810
giving birth, but also
the other person who's

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.820
taking care of the
child potentially

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.460
is getting an additional
year on the tenure clock.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.510
So the intention is here in
particular to involve men more

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.340
in child care.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.470
But you know, those
kinds of policies

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.260
tend to be not enforced,
and potentially

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.960
they might even enhance
gender inequality

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.020
if it's the case that both men
and women get another year.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.810
But the man essentially
takes that as a year

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.710
off where you can do additional
work while the woman is back

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.920
taking care of the
household and the child.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.670
Then, such policies in some
ways might make things worse.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.800
And this is exactly
what some studies find,

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.490
is that these gender neutral
policies, in particular,

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.570
in economics.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.310
There's also some examples
from other settings.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.050
But essentially, introducing
such policies substantially

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.930
reduce female tenure rates while
increasing male tenure rates.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.760
So here's a policy that
looks actually a good policy.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.410
It's gender neutral and so on.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.110
But in fact, it might not
be, depending on who takes

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.310
advantage of that
and who doesn't.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.720
So it's a very tricky question
because some of these things

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.580
are not enforceable.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.920
If instead you gave only these
tenure exemptions to women,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.120
then you would get issues in
households, that then women

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.640
are sort of pushed out
of work, which in part I

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.920
think some of these
neutral tenure

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.773
clocks try to avoid
in the first place.

00:07:02.773 --> 00:07:04.190
So it's not clear
what to do here.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:05.930
But I think it's
important to understand

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.330
that some policies
that look like they

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.740
are in fact neutral or gender
neutral, they might in fact not

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.810
be.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.440
Now, let me tell you what I [got
about one more paper related

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.850
to gender and the labor
market or identity,

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.920
which is very nice paper
by Bursztyn et al., which

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:28.120
asks the question whether women
avoid career enhancing actions

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.250
because these actions
signal undesirable traits.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.570
So in particular,
women might be--

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.550
ambitious women
might be perceived

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:42.250
as not attractive partners
in the labor market,

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.460
in particular, in some settings
such as among MBA students.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.450
And so, in particular, as
you might be familiar with,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.250
there's lots of dating happening
among MBA students, where

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:58.550
people try to essentially find
partners or somebody to get

00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:59.570
married to.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:03.800
And it appears to be the case
that being ambitious or being

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.590
perhaps overly
ambitious is perceived

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:10.340
as negatively as an
undesirable trait

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.980
on the dating market for MBAs.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.160
Now, what Bursztyn et al.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.311
find-- and this is joint work
with Amanda Pallais and Thomas

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:22.130
Fujiwara they find that
unmarried and unmarried

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.920
female MBA students
perform similarly

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.440
when the performance is
unobserved by classmates.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.600
So these are things like
exams, problem sets.

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.517
These are things that
only the professor sees,

00:08:31.517 --> 00:08:33.440
but not necessarily
their classmates.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.830
To here, male and--

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:35.330
sorry.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:38.220
Unmarried and married female
MBA students do similarly

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.330
well when we compare them.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.640
But unmarried women have
lower participation rates.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.360
So these are
essentially things that,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.310
do you say something in class?

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.288
And as you might know, in MBA
classes, in some, at least,

00:08:52.288 --> 00:08:54.580
there's somebody sitting in
the back actually recording

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:58.330
each interaction, each
participation very carefully

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.550
so you know exactly who says
how many things and how often,

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.060
and so on.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:07.120
So it seems to me
that unmarried women

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.390
tend to not want to look too
ambitious and too hard-working

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:11.740
in class.

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.960
Now, that's of course
only suggestive.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.570
So then, they also
have a field experiment

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.270
where they ask people about
their desired salaries

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:23.200
and willingness to travel and
work long hours in real stakes

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.310
placement questioning.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.875
So this essentially, at the
end, there's this placement,

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:28.390
there's these career fairs.

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:31.810
But people ask these
questions about,

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.060
what salary are you expecting?

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.602
Are you willing to
travel really far?

00:09:34.602 --> 00:09:36.280
Are you willing to
work long hours?

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.150
And so on.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:41.630
And of course, these
questions all signal ambition.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.330
And then, the really interesting
part of the experiment

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:47.000
is, then, they varied
whether this information is

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.660
perceived to be private.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.333
So you just saying
it to a recruiter

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.250
but nobody else in your
class, or anybody else

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.970
might find out, versus whether
there some expectation of some

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.740
of their classmates
actually learning

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.200
about their preferences.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:04.190
And what they find, then, is
that the single female students

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.310
report lower desired
salary, and willingness

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:09.380
to travel, and work hours--

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.510
and work long hours
when they think

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:14.870
that there's an expectation that
their classmates might find out

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:15.415
about it.

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:16.790
Which essentially
is to say, they

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.400
perceive it to be
costly for their class,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.550
or their classmates find
out about their ambition.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.460
Now, importantly, two
other things are also true.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.330
One is for other groups.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:31.460
So, other women that are
not single or for men.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:35.610
Essentially, these responses
are unaffected by peer

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.140
observability.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:39.500
And second, it seems
to be that what's

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:44.270
driving the observability
result is the observability

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.560
by single male peers.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.600
So when other female students
or other non-single male peers

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.700
are potentially seeing these
answers, there's no effect.

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.570
But the effect's really coming
from other single male peers

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:02.300
potentially seeing it, which
is precisely what you expect

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.970
if you think having
ambition is potentially

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.590
a negative signal on
the dating market.

00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.810
So that's another
sort of study showing

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.320
that these norms
or perceived norms

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:19.040
are really important, not just
in terms of punishing women

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.410
and in some ways
undeservedly for mistakes

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.150
as we saw in Heather
Sarson's paper,

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:31.640
but also by holding
women back by themselves.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.720
These are single women who are
highly qualified MBA students

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.950
who are deliberately not as
ambitious and hard-working

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.150
as perhaps you might think
they would like to be--

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.950
which is what the private
responses suggest--

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:49.910
because there's a
penalty waiting for them,

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:54.720
or receive penalty coming
on the dating market.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:55.890
Any questions about this?

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.200
So here's a question about,
can it be the opposite?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.650
Better ask this in person.

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:09.090
It's a little bit hard
for me to follow the chat.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.930
But can it be that
more confident women

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:12.230
tend to be married?

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.730
Yes.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:13.690
In principle, yes.

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.940
But I think what we see
here in the experiment

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.330
is, notice that
what I was saying,

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:23.920
I was careful to say these
are about there's a perceived

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.260
penalty of being
overly ambitious.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:29.360
There may well be for some
women, being very ambitious

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:29.860
and so on.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.620
That's a very highly
desirable trait.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.780
But it seems to be that
the perception, at least,

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:44.130
is that being highly ambitious
and so on is not desired.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.340
So I think there's
another question

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:57.980
by Lucy about married
women compensating

00:12:57.980 --> 00:12:59.090
for discrimination.

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.360
I think that's all.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.860
There might be other
stuff going on.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.520
But I think the key part
here is the variation

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:10.230
between private and public
among single female students.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.290
So when they are
asking in private,

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.020
they are saying essentially
they want higher salaries.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.870
When they're asking in public
for higher salaries and they're

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:19.850
willing to work long
hours, and so on.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.650
When they're
answering in public,

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.802
they're essentially
holding back.

00:13:23.802 --> 00:13:25.760
Which seems to suggest--
and that's consistent,

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:28.750
I guess, also with the
participation rates.

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.660
And that's consistent with why
there is at least a perception

00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:38.490
of lower desirability, in
particular among their single

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.720
male peers, which is what
this results is driven by.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:44.730
It's not clear, by the
way, that the study shows

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:46.380
that that's actually true.

00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.620
That's about these
women's perceptions.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.120
The study also
doesn't necessarily

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.760
show that this translates at
the end of the day in lower

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.470
earnings, and so
on, and so forth.

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:58.020
The authors argue
that that's the case.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.530
But these are only
sort of questions--

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.423
real stakes questions and
placement questionnaires.

00:14:04.423 --> 00:14:06.840
It's just sort of essentially
more like a proof of concept

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.210
arguing that this is
an important force that

00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:11.560
might be at play, that
women hold themselves back

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:16.050
in some ways here and in
the case of a placement

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:17.030
questionnaire.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:27.990
I had started this
already last time,

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.680
only briefly going through
the Vesterlund study, which

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:36.390
essentially is saying that
there's two forces going on.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:41.880
There's demand [INAUDIBLE]
in terms of tasks

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.700
that women and men are
perhaps asked differently.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.210
And beliefs could be quite
important here, and mediating

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.150
who has which tasks and when.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:52.650
So let me show you a little bit
of what that study is about.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.440
The study is essentially
asking the question

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:59.280
whether women are not saying
no often enough In particular

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:01.410
when it comes to work.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:03.900
And it's motivated by the
fact those female faculty

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.240
members tend to
do a lot more what

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.850
they call non-promotable tasks.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.790
These are tasks that essentially
everybody wants somebody

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:13.320
to do the task,
but they don't want

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.870
to do the tasks themselves.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.070
So that's like essentially
University committees,

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:21.690
and here, also
undergraduate teaching,

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:23.670
or undergraduate
student advising.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.320
Of course, everybody
loves undergrads

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:28.180
and wants to advise them.

00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:30.690
However, it's not
something that's

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.970
good for peoples' career.

00:15:32.970 --> 00:15:34.800
So at the end of the
day, faculty are often

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.060
evaluated by research output.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.450
So any time that's spent
on committees, et cetera,

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:43.830
these are not going to
be helping for promotions

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:44.370
eventually.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:46.740
And then, one first
observation is that [? women ?]

00:15:46.740 --> 00:15:49.890
do that much more than men.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:52.230
Now you might sort of
ask, why is it that women

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.790
spend their time differently?

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.660
There's potentially
issues of demand.

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.140
Women are just asked a lot
more to do these things.

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.060
And there's potentially
supply issues

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:01.290
conditional on being asked.

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.590
Women might be just much
more likely to say yes.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:07.650
Now, what this paper argues
is that demand and supply

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:08.550
interact.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:11.520
Because women are more
likely to say yes,

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.080
they're also more likely to
be asked in the first place.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:16.710
OK.

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:17.765
So why do we care?

00:16:17.765 --> 00:16:19.140
I think I already
mentioned this.

00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.900
There's sort of a few
broad perspectives.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:22.650
One is about, we kind
of try to understand

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:24.552
individual
decision-making. and we

00:16:24.552 --> 00:16:26.760
want to understand how people
make optimal decisions.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.620
Here's another reason
where people report.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.950
Here is an example where people
potentially mis-optimize.

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:34.530
There's a managerial
social planner perspective

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:36.900
that if you want
to sort of organize

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:41.070
or you want organizations
to be efficient,

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:42.570
you want to make
sure that everybody

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.970
does equal work in some way.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.900
And so you don't
want women who are

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:51.570
very productive to be stuck
in a bunch of other tasks

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.710
that hold them back.

00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.500
And then, there's a
public policy perspective.

00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:00.130
It might essentially
be that sex differences

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:01.617
and the allocation of time.

00:17:01.617 --> 00:17:03.700
So women spending more
time on these kind of tasks

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:07.960
might explain why they're less
likely to be promoted and so

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.530
on.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:11.200
And then, understanding that
and understanding these issues

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.240
might sort of help
with interventions

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.480
to improve equity.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.069
Now, OK.

00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:17.069
So what are these tasks?

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.361
Again there's promotable tasks.

00:17:18.361 --> 00:17:19.349
That's doing research.

00:17:19.349 --> 00:17:21.252
And there's
non-promotable tasks.

00:17:21.252 --> 00:17:22.960
So promotable tasks,
meaning essentially,

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.619
if you do these tasks,
you're likely to be promoted

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:29.790
or essentially get
tenure eventually.

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:31.500
A non-promotable
task essentially

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:33.760
are tasks that many
people could do the task,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.610
but everybody wants
somebody to do it.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.840
But often, nobody actually
wants to do it themselves.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.270
Now, the authors that first
[INAUDIBLE] field study

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.360
where they have faculty at
a large public University

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:47.490
where you send essentially
emails from a chair,

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:50.190
and they're requested
to volunteer

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:53.250
to join one of several
university-wide faculty senate

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:54.330
committees.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.740
And women are essentially,
in these tasks,

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:01.818
are way more likely to volunteer
conditional on being asked.

00:18:01.818 --> 00:18:03.360
So that's the first
piece of evidence

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.430
that conditional on
being asked women

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:07.530
are more likely to be asked.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.780
Then you might say, well,
perhaps there's some

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.460
personality characteristic
[? it's ?] [? on. ?] Maybe

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.127
women are nicer.

00:18:12.127 --> 00:18:15.970
Maybe women care more
about the public good.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.110
Now, what the authors
show is that that may well

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.250
be true in some cases.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.040
But in other cases, it's also
about expectation about who

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.140
does it and who doesn't.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.170
Moreover, the ask
about who is asked

00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:30.930
is quite different depending on
whether you're male or female.

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.130
And that's where the
experiment comes in.

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:34.983
So what they do in
an experiment is

00:18:34.983 --> 00:18:36.900
what's called the threshold
public goods game.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.080
It's very simple, which
is, a small group needs

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.272
to find a volunteer for a task.

00:18:42.272 --> 00:18:43.980
These are groups of
3 people, and there's

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.605
like 10 rounds where
people are matched

00:18:45.605 --> 00:18:48.820
over time with each other.

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:53.070
And so it's essentially set up
to mimic real world situations

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.130
where everyone prefers the task
to be undertaken by someone,

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:57.370
but not themselves.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.100
As you don't want
to do it, you have

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.450
to have somebody else to do it.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:03.180
You want that somebody
does it, but you just

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.050
don't want to do it yourself.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:07.750
And so people get--

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:11.020
the group of 3 gets two minutes
to decide whether to invest.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:12.486
And investing means
essentially you

00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:14.153
have to [? truly ?]
press a button here.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.000
Only one person can
invest, and the round

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.950
ends when someone invests.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.130
If no one invests, all
the members get $1.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:26.140
If you are investing you get
$1.25 and the remaining members

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.017
get $2.

00:19:27.017 --> 00:19:28.600
So if you're thinking
about this task,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:32.000
what are you thinking
about is now, A, is

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.470
somebody else going to invest?

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:37.980
And B, like conditional
on your beliefs about,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.190
is somebody else going
to invest any time soon?

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:42.890
Do you want to invest or not?

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.920
Clearly, it's the efficient
thing that somebody invests.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.740
But you don't want to be
yourself because then you get

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:51.697
only $1.25 rather than the $2.

00:19:51.697 --> 00:19:53.780
And the clock ticks down
until one person invests,

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:57.330
or no investment
is made 2 minutes.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:57.830
OK.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.480
So now what do we find?

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:01.880
Or what did they find
in this experiment?

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.420
Women are way more likely to
invest in each of these rounds.

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.400
This is sort of
the red line here.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.030
The blue line here is for men.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:16.350
And so women are much more
likely to invest than men.

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.130
And that's very clear when
you look at these figures.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.638
And that's also very
persistent over time.

00:20:23.638 --> 00:20:26.180
So it's not just like, perhaps
in the first round, and so on.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.500
This is even after 10 rounds.

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.480
When people keep being
matched with others over time,

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.510
women are much more
likely to invest.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:34.760
Now, how do we interpret this?

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.010
So how do we think about this?

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.243
What can we learn about this?

00:20:37.243 --> 00:20:38.910
One explanation that
I already mentioned

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:40.890
is, women are much nicer.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:44.130
But can you infer
this from this task?

00:20:44.130 --> 00:20:46.180
You observe if women are
a lot nicer than men,

00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:48.638
well, then you should find that
women are more cooperative,

00:20:48.638 --> 00:20:50.790
as Lucy suggests.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:53.280
If women are a lot
more cooperative,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.250
you should see that
in women-only groups,

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:58.590
women are much more
likely to invest

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:00.720
than in male-only groups.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.210
And that's exactly what they
tried to do in the experiment.

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.320
So they have essentially
single sex sessions

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.870
would have all-female
and all-male groups.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.830
And what you find is, while
the probability of investing

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:16.810
is actually exactly the
same for men and women,

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:18.840
they also find that
when trying to predict

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:25.043
who's investing who is not, any
measures of social preferences,

00:21:25.043 --> 00:21:27.210
risk preferences and so on
that they've [? listed ?]

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.930
previously actually not
predictive of this behavior.

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.600
That sort of suggests it's
really not about altruism

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.320
in a sense of being
nicer or wanting.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.840
So in some sense, investing
is doing something nice

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.670
for the others in your group.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.830
It doesn't seem to be
that it's about that.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.830
It's also not so much
about risk aversion.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:51.000
So you might say, well, I'm
investing because I really

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:51.630
like certainty.

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.820
If I invest, I know
exactly what I'm getting.

00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:55.860
If I'm not investing,
I have a chance

00:21:55.860 --> 00:21:58.200
of like getting the
$2 or essentially

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:00.930
a lottery between $2 and
$1, depending on, then,

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.150
the probability is
essentially about what

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.310
you think is the probability
of others investing.

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:07.390
So your risk aversion
might matter,

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.720
but they also show that
risk aversion is really not

00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.900
important.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:13.480
So now they have
essentially two experiments.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.230
One is the experiment,
1 that I showed you.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:19.410
Women are more likely to
invest in mixed sex groups,

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.700
and women and men are equally
likely to invest in single sex

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:24.360
groups.

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.860
And so now, then,
what they're doing

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:27.443
is, then, they're
trying to say, well,

00:22:27.443 --> 00:22:29.700
could it be that beliefs
that women will invest

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:31.228
are important here?

00:22:31.228 --> 00:22:32.520
So that's essentially the idea.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.370
If you think women are
more likely to invest

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.670
than men, if women think
this and men think this,

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:41.580
then essentially you're
going to get in a situation

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:46.020
where if you have
a mixed sex group,

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.360
then you will have one
woman saying to men,

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:51.000
the woman thinks, oh, the men
are not going to invest anyway.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.850
So either it's like we're
investing or getting $1.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:56.308
So then, for the women,
it's optimal to invest.

00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:57.850
And the men are
going to think, well,

00:22:57.850 --> 00:22:59.058
the woman is going to invest.

00:22:59.058 --> 00:23:01.560
So why should they invest if
the woman is investing anyway?

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.360
For them, it's then
optimal not to invest.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.240
Now, experiment 3,
then, get set this

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.220
in some ways, which essentially
is about now getting

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.005
women and men to ask to invest.

00:23:18.005 --> 00:23:20.380
What they do is, essentially,
they have what's called a--

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.850
they call it a photo ask, which
they have 4 people per group.

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.477
3 people as 4 can invest.

00:23:26.477 --> 00:23:28.060
That's essentially
the same as before.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:29.240
They call them green players.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.565
Not sure why, but they
essentially [? do ?]

00:23:30.565 --> 00:23:31.750
[? their ?] green players.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:34.720
And one person is
unable to invest,

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:39.260
but he can ask one of the
three others to invest.

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.570
It's not a binding request.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.400
Essentially, it's
sort of a nudge.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.317
So if you want to, instead
of essentially just

00:23:44.317 --> 00:23:46.750
suggest that they may
exert some social pressure,

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:47.710
that's the red player.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.918
And then, the red player is
essentially incentivized.

00:23:49.918 --> 00:23:52.833
The red player wants the
investment to happen.

00:23:52.833 --> 00:23:54.250
So this is kind
of what this looks

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.910
like, is essentially
three people

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:57.220
that you see as the red player.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:23:58.720
And you can say,
whom would you ask?

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.920
Well, any of these three.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.420
You see the photos,
so obviously you

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.450
see the gender of the person.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:09.110
And so, what they then find
is that women are much more

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.110
likely to be asked.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.920
You can see here, the red
lines are more to the right,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.500
or there's more red
to the right, which

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.750
is the total times
asked to invest.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.590
So there's more asked to the
right for women than for men.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.510
Now, what did we
learn from that?

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.520
Well, absent a request,
investment rates

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:30.350
do not differ by gender.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.630
But when asked to invest,
women are more likely to do so.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.130
So there's two
things going on here.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:38.450
One is, when asked, women
are more responsive.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:41.210
And [INAUDIBLE] says that
the marginal increase

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.450
of being asked is higher
for women than for men.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.830
And then, in addition, women are
also more likely to be asked.

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:50.420
Which is to say,
when people have

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.460
the choice about
whom should you ask,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.440
well, they kind of know
who is the person who

00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:03.530
is more likely to react, which
is the woman in the group.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.080
So they correctly
understand that if they

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.660
ask the woman, that
it's going to have more

00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:10.520
of an impact than asking men.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:11.660
And that's true.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:16.170
So when women are asked, they're
also more likely to comply.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.820
So now, that essentially sort
of says these gender differences

00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:24.770
get amplified by increases
for women to contribute.

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:29.000
So not only is it the case that
they're more likely to say yes,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.690
but on top of that, they
also will get more requests.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:37.017
Which of course, then, is like,
they do so much work overall.

00:25:37.017 --> 00:25:38.600
And so, what's key
here is about this.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.250
it's not about preferences.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.930
It's essentially
just an equilibrium

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:45.920
that at the end of the
day will be sustained.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.110
Because again, if men think
women are going to do it

00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:50.180
anyway, and if
women think, well,

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.862
nobody's going to do
it unless I myself,

00:25:51.862 --> 00:25:54.320
[? when ?] [? I ?] [? am ?] in
situations where it might be

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.960
optimal for both women
and men to do it,

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.690
conditional on
their [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:00.920
Any questions on this study?

00:26:14.595 --> 00:26:18.900
OK, so then, let me
just summarize a bit.

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.950
So we saw large gender wage
and earnings gaps that even

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.140
persisted even until now.

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.700
Substantial progress
has been made

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.980
due to the
technological advances

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.620
and other improvements, but
sort of those persistent gender

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:36.210
differences in many
societies, including the US.

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:38.490
Biased beliefs and
identity concerns

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:43.080
appear to play a particularly
important role, in particular,

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.050
in some issues such as
educational differences

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:49.080
and so on.

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.750
And given the
technological advances,

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.662
some of these technological
issues are less important now.

00:26:54.662 --> 00:26:57.120
But really, it seems to be that
biased beliefs and identity

00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:01.110
concerns are at the center of
explaining things in addition

00:27:01.110 --> 00:27:02.457
to the child penalty.

00:27:02.457 --> 00:27:04.290
But even the child
penalty, you might argue,

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.037
is driven by beliefs,
and identity, and so on.

00:27:08.037 --> 00:27:09.870
And then there are these
feedback mechanisms

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:12.930
between demand and
supplies of tasks

00:27:12.930 --> 00:27:14.730
that women and men are doing.

00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:16.980
And in particular, it seems
to be that, again, beliefs

00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.147
are important in the sense
of, like, it matters what

00:27:19.147 --> 00:27:20.550
people think other people do.

00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:28.570
And then that seems to create,
essentially, these inequalities

00:27:28.570 --> 00:27:29.878
across gender.

00:27:29.878 --> 00:27:31.420
Now, if you want to
sort of mitigate,

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:33.400
or reduce, or eliminate
the gender gap,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.560
it's really important to
understand these issues.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.110
I think we have made
quite a bit of progress

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.310
in understanding what's going
on, and identifying the issue.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:45.490
Now, I think the next steps
are to try and understand

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:49.330
what are policies that are
in fact successful in helping

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:51.400
us do that.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.120
So this lecture is about
defaults, nudges, and frames.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:57.640
And originally, I had planned
to also do mental accounting.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.220
But given that we
didn't finish last time,

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.750
I moved this to a later
lecture, at least [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:05.507
OK, so where are
we in the course?

00:28:05.507 --> 00:28:06.840
We talk a lot about preferences.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.550
We talked a lot about beliefs
and the interaction of those,

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:13.790
and sort of potential deviations
from the classical model.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.290
Now, we're going to talk about
non-standard decision-making.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.640
And one way to think
about this is to say,

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.335
even if you understand
people's preferences very well,

00:28:21.335 --> 00:28:22.710
then you can
understand these are

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:24.510
non-standard preferences
in some ways,

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:26.490
and potentially biased beliefs.

00:28:26.490 --> 00:28:30.450
Even conditional on that,
people might behave in some ways

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.880
where they deviate from
the neoclassical model.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.605
That is hard to explain just
by deviations and preferences

00:28:36.605 --> 00:28:37.313
[INAUDIBLE].

00:28:37.313 --> 00:28:38.730
So there are
additional deviations

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:41.440
from the neoclassical model
that are beyond changes

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.490
in preferences and beliefs.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:46.770
In particular, I'm going to
talk now about frames, defaults,

00:28:46.770 --> 00:28:47.340
and nudges.

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.530
Mental accounting is a
similar case of that.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:52.530
We'll talk about this later.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.098
OK, and so the most famous
paper in this space,

00:28:57.098 --> 00:28:58.890
or one of the most
famous paper [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.530
is about 401(k) savings.

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:04.108
So companies offer
these 401(k) savings.

00:29:04.108 --> 00:29:04.650
That's right.

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.680
So it's in fact the most common
voluntary savings vehicle

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:08.880
in the US.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.660
What you do is you set aside
some money for retirement,

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:15.300
and you choose what's called
the contribution rate.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:18.180
It's like what fraction of the
income you want to contribute,

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:22.200
and you choose the
asset allocation.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.000
That is offered by
companies-- by employers.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.010
Now, why are
employers doing this?

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.625
Because employers want to--

00:29:30.625 --> 00:29:32.000
it's seen as sort
of a nice thing

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.110
that employers can do
for their employees.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.260
It's potentially
a way in which you

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:44.570
can create some form of
solidarity with your employees.

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:47.960
In a way, you want
your workers to do

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:53.100
well in retirement beyond their
working for you, and so on.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.340
And then, sort of overall,
what companies often do

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.560
is they offer matching
contributions up

00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.450
to a threshold.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:03.660
This often incentivizes that,
in fact, fairly strongly.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.760
There's also a penalty
for early withdrawal.

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:09.180
Why is there a penalty
for early withdrawal?

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:09.870
Yeah, exactly.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.415
It's like a soft commitment
device in some ways,

00:30:12.415 --> 00:30:15.040
in the sense of-- or it's a hard
commitment device in the sense

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.100
that it's dominated.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.575
But essentially, it's like you
want-- it's sort of a mixture.

00:30:20.575 --> 00:30:22.950
You could have if like a hard
commitment, or a fully hard

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:24.750
commitment, or very
hard commitment device.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:29.310
But you could say, you cannot
withdraw this until age 60,

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:33.090
or something, or 55, or
65, whenever you retire.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:34.050
That's not what it is.

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.870
Instead, there's a penalty
that's often like 10%.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:41.150
And the penalty is there
because you want to get people--

00:30:41.150 --> 00:30:42.660
avoid that people--

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:44.700
what's called leakage,
that people essentially

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:47.790
withdraw money early,
presumably because

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:51.000
of self-control problems,
present bias, and so on.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.690
There's lots of
leakage, in fact,

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.440
even though there's
a 10% withdrawal.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:56.970
There's a 10%
withdrawal as opposed

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.650
to shutting it down entirely
because sometimes people have

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:00.150
shocks.

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:01.650
They have health
problems and so on.

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:02.880
They need a bunch of money.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.400
And in those cases, of course,
you want to allow this,

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.320
or the company wants to
allow that to people.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.240
So a 10% penalty
tends to be sort

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.760
of compromise between that.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:13.650
There's tax deferral,
which is you pay,

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:17.100
usually, a lower marginal tax
rate during retirement, right?

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.100
When people are 30, 40
they earn a lot of money

00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:23.310
compared to when they're
70 during retirement.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:26.520
So people can pay
taxes when they receive

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.100
the money at retirement,
so to the extent

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.700
that your marginal tax
rate is lower then,

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:34.630
you're going to save
some money from that.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.422
So that's another reason
why you might want

00:31:36.422 --> 00:31:39.200
to use your 401(k) savings.

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:43.370
Now, what are some patterns
401(k) investments?

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:46.110
2/3 of employees believe that
they're saving too little

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.510
when you just ask them.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:51.680
And 1/4 of these intends
to raise their savings

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.800
in the next two months.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.650
So that's sort of the typical
thing that sort of smells

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.692
like self-control problems,
where you ask people,

00:31:56.692 --> 00:32:00.163
like, are you happy
with your savings?

00:32:00.163 --> 00:32:01.580
Should you be
saving more or less?

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.730
Then people tend to say, oh, no,
no, I want to really save more.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.290
Next two months,
I'm going to do it.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:09.590
This is sort of the same as when
you ask people about the gym.

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:13.500
I [INAUDIBLE] exercise
more every month.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.860
But it happens.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.690
Almost nobody follows through.

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:20.780
In fact, the
reported undersavers

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.550
have low savings rates.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.220
You find similar patterns
also in other surveys.

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.770
If you're interested in more
of the Choi et al survey,

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:32.050
it does a very nice job at
summarizing these patterns.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:36.070
Now, given these patterns,
what are standard economics

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.492
tools to increase savings?

00:32:37.492 --> 00:32:38.950
Suppose you are
the social planner,

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:42.130
or a company want to
increase people's savings.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.340
What would standard economics
1401, 14-A, or whatever

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.630
tell you what should we do
to increase people's savings?

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.160
How would you do that?

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.070
First, the matching contribution
is very much like an incentive,

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.520
so, like, a very standard,
straightforward incentive, Econ

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.667
101 would tell you people
react to incentives.

00:32:59.667 --> 00:33:01.000
So let's give people incentives.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.160
We provide matching
contributions, and therefore

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:03.740
people--

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:07.868
essentially increases the
rate of return on savings.

00:33:07.868 --> 00:33:09.285
And these matching
contributions--

00:33:09.285 --> 00:33:12.030
I'll show you in a second--
tend to be very high, or fairly

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:12.530
high.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.450
And so people should
be doing it more

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:17.110
if you make it more
attractive [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:19.353
under usual circumstances.

00:33:19.353 --> 00:33:20.270
What else could we do?

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.900
And maybe that's not
necessarily standard economics.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.360
Of course, one option will
be, like, the default.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.890
But what other options
could have or we do?

00:33:35.890 --> 00:33:37.880
What else could we do
[INAUDIBLE] people?

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:38.380
Right?

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.200
So you could-- so the
matching contribution

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.492
is a way of doing that,
essentially because I'm telling

00:33:42.492 --> 00:33:47.790
you I'm matching however much
you're contributing by adding

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.760
so much money in your
account, and you're not

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.050
supposed to withdraw it.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.210
So that's implicitly
giving you a return.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.210
Another thing I think
that you're already saying

00:33:57.210 --> 00:33:58.890
is what I have
here as well, which

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:03.065
is provide additional choices
or better choices in some ways,

00:34:03.065 --> 00:34:05.190
or improving what's called
our financial education.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.960
That's to say,
maybe people are not

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.230
investing in the right thing.

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:10.360
And so maybe I could
either give them

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.300
better investment
funds or better options

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.960
that have higher returns.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.980
And by doing so, people will
be inclined to save more.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.280
Or maybe I can explain to
them better, for example,

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.650
compound interest and so
on, and sort of [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:22.650 --> 00:34:24.900
that people don't quite
understand, perhaps

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.250
because of lower education.

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.167
Now, that's not necessarily
standard economics

00:34:28.167 --> 00:34:29.958
in the sense of, like,
people are confused.

00:34:29.958 --> 00:34:32.219
That's sort of not what
standard economics would say.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:34.170
But it might well
be that people are--

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:39.239
if you explain to them better
what is compound interest,

00:34:39.239 --> 00:34:42.672
and if you can save now 5% of
your income, how much will that

00:34:42.672 --> 00:34:44.130
be in 30 years from
now, people are

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.532
often surprised because
that's very high.

00:34:46.532 --> 00:34:47.699
You could sort of get them--

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:49.440
provide them with
additional choices,

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.199
maybe make it more
attractive for them.

00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:53.909
You could even sort of subsidize
it and say, here's a fund,

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:55.159
and I'm giving you more money.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:57.534
Notice that that would be
quite expensive for the company

00:34:57.534 --> 00:34:58.450
to do over time.

00:34:58.450 --> 00:35:00.690
So companies tend
to not do that.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.370
Now, it turns out,
none of these tools

00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:03.760
tend to be very effective.

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.230
So people have tried this,
despite the fact that--

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:09.510
they have been
matching contributions

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:13.590
despite the effect of
financial education, sort

00:35:13.590 --> 00:35:16.320
of information sessions,
providing more choices,

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:16.960
and so on.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.793
Notice that it actually
sometimes backfires,

00:35:18.793 --> 00:35:20.040
because people get confused.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.930
There's too many choices, or
what's called choice overload.

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:26.250
So these things tend to
not work particularly well.

00:35:26.250 --> 00:35:30.990
Now, one question again, why
are companies actually trying

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:33.067
to increase people's savings?

00:35:33.067 --> 00:35:34.650
So in some sense,
you might say, well,

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.095
we're offering-- here's
your 401(k) savings.

00:35:37.095 --> 00:35:43.470
We'll offer it to you, but
whoever wants to actually do it

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:44.130
can use it.

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.830
And otherwise, we really
don't care that much.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.920
So why are companies still
interested in doing this?

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.323
Why are people
paying this match?

00:35:51.323 --> 00:35:52.740
We had some answer
already before,

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.450
but that's actually not
quite the answer why

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:58.330
this is [? going. ?]

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.290
So to be clear,
there's two questions.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.665
One question that we talked
about a little bit previously

00:36:02.665 --> 00:36:06.100
was, like, why might the company
offer savings options anyway?

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:08.320
And the second one is
conditional on offering that--

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.820
why is the company
really interested

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.175
in increasing take-up?

00:36:11.175 --> 00:36:12.550
Because they say,
well, whatever.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:13.110
We offer it.

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:14.620
Some people like it,
some people don't.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:16.203
If they don't like
it, why do we care?

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.960
So I always thought, you know--

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.013
when I first read about this,
I thought companies are nice

00:36:24.013 --> 00:36:26.180
and they want to sort of
be good to their employers,

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.160
and they want the best
for their workers.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.950
And you're already a lot
more cynical in a sense of,

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:33.350
like, you're kind
of saying, how do we

00:36:33.350 --> 00:36:36.800
get workers to work a lot more?

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.320
It could be.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:39.320
I mean, I haven't heard
of what you were saying.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.470
But I think in principle,
that could be a reason where--

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.260
in a way, I think companies
like workers to be happy.

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:49.310
And to the extent that if
they consume more right now,

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:52.142
that probably makes them happier
and perhaps more productive,

00:36:52.142 --> 00:36:53.600
so then, in some
ways, probably you

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.000
have the incentives to have
people not save too much.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.708
Because in some ways,
you don't care that

00:36:57.708 --> 00:37:02.900
much about whether somebody
who is 60 is particularly happy

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:03.530
or has money.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:07.200
Because essentially, you
can't really engage or you--

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.510
age discrimination is illegal.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:11.660
So you can't fire, like,
a 57-year-old person who

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:13.160
is doing their job
reasonably well,

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:16.890
but maybe is not as productive
as you'd like them to be.

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:22.070
And so to them, if that person
has saved a lot of money,

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:24.770
they probably are
more likely to retire.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.530
You guys are more
cynical than I am.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:32.730
So the reported reason for
a lot of these policies

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.790
is, in fact, the reason that
there is IRS nondiscrimination

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:36.820
rules.

00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:38.020
What does that mean?

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:44.910
Essentially, by the IRS rules,
it cannot be that people who

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:50.430
are paid a lot can benefit from
certain retirement and other

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:53.280
schemes way more than people
who are paid very little.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:56.190
Now it turns out that
low income or low wage

00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:00.150
workers are much
less likely to save

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:04.640
in 401(k) and other
savings schemes.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.310
Therefore, they're much
less likely to receive

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.460
any of these 401(k) matching
and other contributions.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.440
And therefore, essentially,
their companies

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.990
tend to have way
more money spent

00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:18.310
on sort of high paid employees
than low paid employees.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:20.060
And there are some
nondiscrimination rules

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.360
by the IRS that
says that's illegal.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.740
You can't do that.

00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:29.180
And therefore, companies are
very keen on getting lower--

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.740
if you are like a
CEO or something,

00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:33.330
you want your
workers to earn very

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:38.570
little to invest in 401(k)
and other types of schemes

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.970
that they get rewarded
for, because that allows

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.670
them, essentially, to pay
the high paid employees

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:46.958
higher bonuses, in these
kinds of schemes as well.

00:38:46.958 --> 00:38:48.500
That's essentially
one of the reasons

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.780
why companies are
very, very interested

00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:54.410
in increasing their 401(k)
savings, in particular

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:58.040
among workers with low wages.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:03.560
And that's exactly what the
default to default policy's

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.100
tend to do.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.600
Chad, did you have
another question,

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.854
or was that just your
hand that's still up?

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:14.330
OK, so let me move on.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.642
So why would you participate
in 401(k) savings schemes?

00:39:17.642 --> 00:39:18.850
We already talked about this.

00:39:18.850 --> 00:39:20.770
What are the costs
of nonparticipation?

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:23.440
There are essentially
three main reasons

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.120
from the worker's perspective.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.800
There's foregone tax benefits.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.960
And tax benefits are, again,
your marginal tax rate,

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.600
usually while
people are working,

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.730
tends to be higher than
the marginal tax rate

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.240
when people are retiring.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:40.370
So essentially, by
investing in 401(k) savings,

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:44.060
they can defer taxes
and save some taxes.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:49.530
Second, people forgo
the employer match.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.290
I'll tell you about
this in the second.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:52.730
And number three is--

00:39:52.730 --> 00:39:54.320
that's a little
more subtle, which

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:57.470
is foregone consumption
smoothing, which, essentially,

00:39:57.470 --> 00:40:00.440
is your marginal--

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.990
the marginal value
of a dollar for you,

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:06.220
while you're working
at age 30 or 40,

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:09.760
tends to be lower than the
marginal value of a dollar

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.367
once you're 70 or 80.

00:40:11.367 --> 00:40:13.450
The reason being that,
essentially, you're richer.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:15.970
You have more money available
when you're 30 or 40,

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.790
so you actually want to smooth
consumption to later in time.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:22.480
Of course, there's a discounting
motive going the other way.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.320
But it shouldn't be that,
essentially, at age 59 or 64,

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.630
you earn a lot of money
and consume a lot, and then

00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:33.370
the year after, once you retire,
your consumption drops a lot.

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.100
Economists would say you
should smooth this out by,

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.200
essentially, saving some
money to the future.

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.410
And 401(k) savings [INAUDIBLE]
might help you with that.

00:40:41.410 --> 00:40:43.900
Now, why do companies care?

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.950
I already said that.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:49.120
Essentially-- whoops,
sorry, going back.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.430
Non-highly compensated
employees don't save enough,

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:53.950
or don't save very much, in
particular in new schemes.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.020
And the IRS
nondiscrimination tests--

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:57.730
has essentially
nondiscrimination tests

00:40:57.730 --> 00:41:02.685
in pension plans that
precisely try to prevent that.

00:41:02.685 --> 00:41:04.060
So really, what
you want to do is

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:10.050
you want to get your low
income workers to save.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:12.960
OK, so now here comes the
paper by Madrian and Shea.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:16.620
That's a very successful and one
of the most successful papers

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.360
in behavioral economics.

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:24.117
The reason being that, A,
standard economics has sort of

00:41:24.117 --> 00:41:25.950
failed in some ways,
in the sense of saying,

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:29.010
like, we tried
matching contributions,

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:31.590
we tried giving people
education or information,

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:33.690
and so on, and so forth,
and none of these things

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:36.130
have worked very well.

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.112
And then instead, something
that shouldn't matter--

00:41:39.112 --> 00:41:41.320
which is what I'm going to
show you in a second-- the

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.500
defaults mattered a lot,
and had huge effects,

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.320
which is very hard for
standard economics to explain.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.287
And then on top of that,
this is in a domain

00:41:50.287 --> 00:41:51.620
that we really care about a lot.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:53.680
Savings is one of the
most important choices

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.150
that economists have considered.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:57.700
And so that's a
very good example

00:41:57.700 --> 00:42:02.500
of an early example of an
aspect of the economics,

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.270
in this case
default, that really

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.670
matters in some ways
that's hard to explain

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:08.020
for standard economics.

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.270
And the standard
tools of economics

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:13.350
seem to not have been
working very well.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.570
OK, so what does the
paper actually do?

00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:19.620
It's a large publicly-traded,
fortune 500 healthcare company.

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.350
You can enroll in 401(k)
savings plans any day

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:24.660
by essentially filling
out an enrollment form,

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.330
or calling the
401(k) record keeper.

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:28.855
What does that mean?

00:42:28.855 --> 00:42:30.480
Essentially, you call
somebody and say,

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.280
I want you to invest
in 401(k) savings

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.570
when you're in this company.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:37.430
And you're going to
say, I'm going to--

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.130
I want to save, say,
5% of my earnings.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:42.260
I want to save every month.

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:43.850
Or you could fill out a form.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.560
Now, these days, a
lot of this is online.

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.310
So if at MIT, you want to
change your 401(k) savings,

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.800
you essentially have to
fill out an online form,

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:55.350
and change your online
allocation [? potential. ?]

00:42:55.350 --> 00:42:59.210
So there's potentially small
transaction costs involved.

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:02.090
But notice that the transaction
cost tends to be very minor,

00:43:02.090 --> 00:43:04.580
in a sense, like, it's going
to take you maybe 10 minutes,

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.110
maybe 20 minutes-- maybe if
you think about it for a while,

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:08.120
it takes you an hour--

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.220
but really, it's a
very minor cost of time

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.910
overall that this
costs you compared

00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:20.780
to the potentially huge benefits
of employer matches and so on.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.170
Now, what are these
employer matches?

00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:26.290
In this particular company,
it's a 50% matching contribution

00:43:26.290 --> 00:43:28.210
for the first 6%.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:29.920
So again, what are
these percentages?

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.820
The percentages are essentially
the fraction of your income

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.620
that you'd like to
contribute to these savings.

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:42.510
For example, 5% or 3%, or
7% is what you're saving.

00:43:42.510 --> 00:43:44.130
And now the company
says they're going

00:43:44.130 --> 00:43:48.360
to match 50% for the first 6%.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.180
For example, if an
employee chooses 4%,

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.520
the company pays
an additional 2%

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.100
into that savings
account right away.

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.830
So that's actually
quite a bit of money.

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.980
If an employee chooses
10%, the company

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:05.460
pays an additional 3%,
because that employee

00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:07.380
is above the cap of 6%.

00:44:07.380 --> 00:44:11.580
So you cannot get more
than 3% from the company.

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.140
Other companies
these days have even,

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:17.940
like, 100% matching
contribution for 5% or the like.

00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:20.020
That tends to be fairly common.

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:23.790
So for example, MIT has
100% matching contribution

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:28.610
for the first, I think, 5%.

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:30.920
In this specific
company, the employees

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.370
are first eligible after
one year of employment

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:36.355
before the change
happened of the policy

00:44:36.355 --> 00:44:38.330
that I'm going to talk
about in a second.

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.090
Now, notice that this
is a terrible policy

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:43.130
from a behavioral
economics perspective,

00:44:43.130 --> 00:44:45.680
in terms of if you wanted
people to sign up and go

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.543
do this, that's not
what you would do.

00:44:47.543 --> 00:44:50.210
If I'm telling you, like, here's
a thing that I want you to sign

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:53.540
up for, in a year from now
please come back and do it,

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:56.270
well, in a year from
now, people might forget.

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:57.620
People might procrastinate.

00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:01.590
People might be busy
with other things.

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:06.742
So it's not a policy that's
great to do to start with

00:45:06.742 --> 00:45:07.700
to get people involved.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.200
And in some sense,
there's no wonder

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.950
that participation early
on was kind of low.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.230
Now, the company does
that because turnover

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:16.130
tends to be high.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.050
And you try to
avoid paying people

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:20.013
early on that
might leave anyway.

00:45:20.013 --> 00:45:21.680
And you have to deal
with the paperwork,

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.127
and so on and so forth.

00:45:23.127 --> 00:45:25.460
Notice that that might be
exactly the wrong thing to do,

00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.610
because once people have paid
into their 401(k) savings,

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:31.280
maybe that creates some loyalty
and makes workers to stay

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.750
more at the company anyway.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.240
But for what it's worth,
in this particular case,

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:40.160
employees were only eligible
and one year after employment.

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.000
Now, then there's
a discontinuity

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.830
of the 401(k) plan default
based on the date of hire.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:49.540
So here's the old cohort--

00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:53.050
the window cohort, as I call
it-- and the new cohort.

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:57.910
So the old cohort are people who
are hired between 1st of April,

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:00.480
'96 and 31st of March, '97.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.110
So they are essentially people
who have been previously hired.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.960
This is what I just told you.

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.140
You can, after one year--

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.580
after being hired after
one year, you can--

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.060
you're not
automatically enrolled,

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:15.380
but you can essentially
just call somebody and say,

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:18.430
I would like to start
saving in my 401(k) savings.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.890
Or you could fill out this form.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.390
Then, there is the
new cohort, which

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:24.940
essentially is automatic
enrollment, which

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:28.690
is everything is exactly the
same, but by the date of hire.

00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:30.760
So when you're
hired immediately,

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.170
you're automatically enrolled.

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:35.150
So they're not asking you.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:36.650
They're giving you
some information,

00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:38.470
but they say, unless
you change, unless you

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.810
want to make a
change, you're going

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.810
to be automatically
enrolled immediately.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:47.020
And when you automatically
enrolled somebody,

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.750
then you need to also specify
where the money goes to.

00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:51.740
So they have an
automatic enrollment.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.100
You need to choose the
contribution rate, which is

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:55.970
the default contribution rate.

00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:58.690
And they need to have a
default fund allocation, which

00:46:58.690 --> 00:47:01.870
is-- so they have a default
contribution rate which is 3%.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:03.940
And you need to put the
money somewhere, right?

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:06.340
So if I'm automatically
doing something for you

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.590
with your money, I need to
put the money somewhere.

00:47:08.590 --> 00:47:10.690
What the company is
doing is the company

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:15.190
puts the money into
the money market fund.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:17.350
Is that a good idea, a bad idea?

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:18.850
Why is the company
putting the money

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:19.990
into the money market fund?

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:22.448
Is that what you're supposed
to be doing with your savings?

00:47:22.448 --> 00:47:34.340
[INAUDIBLE] Or
maybe first explain

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.410
what is a money market
fund, and then tell

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:37.610
is it a good or bad idea.

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.770
Somebody says they saw dot come
bubble coming, potentially.

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:44.340
But I think if you save for
retirement, what should you do?

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:48.060
Here's free investment
advice for everybody.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:48.923
What should you do?

00:47:48.923 --> 00:47:50.340
What are people
telling you, like,

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:52.063
if you go to somebody
who does finance?

00:47:52.063 --> 00:47:53.730
[INAUDIBLE] but
essentially, what people

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:55.770
would argue you
should be doing is

00:47:55.770 --> 00:47:57.960
you should invest in
stocks or some forms

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.480
of diversified
portfolio of stocks.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.970
You should buy, essentially,
the stock market, S&P 500,

00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:08.820
or the world stock
market, or the like,

00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:12.750
which essentially is risky, but
also has a much higher return.

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:17.910
Now, given that if you started
investing at age 25 or 30,

00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:20.160
if you do that for
30, 40 years, that

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:24.160
has a very likely very high
long-run return, and a much

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.160
higher long-run return
than you will have if you

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.160
invest in the money market.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:32.170
Now, there's a question of what
is the optimal risk and so on.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.870
But investing, nobody--
no investment advisor

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:38.740
in their right mind,
maybe perhaps partially

00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:41.480
because they want to make money,
but I think including people

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:43.570
who want the best
for you will tell you

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.430
you should invest everything
and the money market.

00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:48.843
Now why are the
companies doing that?

00:48:48.843 --> 00:48:51.010
Essentially, the company
is worried about liability,

00:48:51.010 --> 00:48:53.500
and about getting sued, or
getting, at least, in trouble

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.510
with their employees.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.160
If they default--
so essentially,

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:01.090
if I'm not offering
any retirement savings,

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:04.390
then I'm like, of course,
that's not a big risk to take.

00:49:04.390 --> 00:49:06.160
If I'm in a sense
saying, I'm hiring you,

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.230
and I'm putting your
money without really

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:09.760
getting explicit
consent for you,

00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:12.040
without you explicitly
saying you want it,

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.120
and putting your money into some
investment fund, potentially

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.210
a risky investment fund, and
that thing essentially crashes,

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.950
and people lose a
lot of money, they're

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:23.080
going to get really upset
with you, potentially.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.240
And that's, from the
company's perspective,

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.653
just not worth doing.

00:49:26.653 --> 00:49:28.570
Essentially, the company
wants to help people.

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:33.270
Again, remember a part of
the motive of the company

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.970
was just to get people to
contribute in the first place,

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:40.130
to essentially get around the
IRS nondiscrimination rules.

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:43.840
And so the company is really
not necessarily that interested

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.810
in high returns
for their workers.

00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:50.130
And in particular, companies
worry potentially about,

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.130
essentially, the stock
market crashing, and then

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:54.297
sort of people getting
really upset with them, which

00:49:54.297 --> 00:49:55.589
would be quite costly for them.

00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:57.297
And then they would
be, like, why did you

00:49:57.297 --> 00:49:58.700
put the money in
this risky thing

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:01.880
while in fact, you could have
put it in the money market,

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:02.612
and so on?

00:50:02.612 --> 00:50:04.070
And the reason
being is essentially

00:50:04.070 --> 00:50:05.720
because there's no
explicit consent,

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:09.230
because it's essentially
a default option where

00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:12.420
the default is such that
you're automatically enrolled.

00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.360
So unless you tell
me otherwise, you're

00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:16.760
going to be-- the money's
going to put there.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:20.300
And so there's never
something where

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:25.800
the person says, yes, I want the
money to be invested in x or y.

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:28.830
So then, this here
is the main result

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:31.080
of the paper, which
is the participation

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:35.100
rates in 401(k) savings
accounts are dramatically

00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.440
higher with automatic
enrollment compared

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.640
to the previous regime.

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:41.910
So you see here, this
is the old cohort.

00:50:41.910 --> 00:50:43.350
This is the window cohort.

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:44.850
And these are previous cohorts.

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:47.910
So you see that prior
to automatic enrollment,

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:49.950
the participation increases--

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:51.188
or increased with the tenure.

00:50:51.188 --> 00:50:53.230
That is to say, the longer
you're at the company,

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:54.870
the higher the
fraction of people

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.900
who participate
in 401(k) savings.

00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.380
But even people who have been
in the company for 20 plus years

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:06.030
have only, like, a
contribution rate of about 83%.

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:07.830
Now, if you do automatic
enrollment, which

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:14.267
is getting people
enrolled-- but people

00:51:14.267 --> 00:51:15.850
are free to choose
whatever they want.

00:51:15.850 --> 00:51:18.880
If they don't want to invest
money into the 401(k) savings

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:19.630
account.

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:21.950
They can opt out at
any point in time.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:24.790
But when you do that,
people get essentially way

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:28.150
more likely to be enrolled.

00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:31.720
The participation rate
is as high as 86%.

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.940
So there are essentially
dramatic differences

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:36.520
in what you would argue is a
very important choice, which

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.550
is, if you think about what are
important choices in your life,

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:42.027
savings choice is one of
the most important ones.

00:51:42.027 --> 00:51:43.360
So there's dramatic differences.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:45.220
And when you do
automatic enrollment,

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:48.910
people are way more likely
to enroll than if not.

00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:51.790
Now, in addition-- sorry.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:55.430
And then this is here
is, I guess, the part

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:57.140
about the low income workers.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:58.850
When you look at--

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.560
this is-- when you
look at the first two

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.250
columns of this table,
here you see these effects.

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:07.605
So first you see, this is
the window cohort here.

00:52:07.605 --> 00:52:09.230
This is the cohort
that was essentially

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:11.720
before the change was done.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.600
And here is the
new cohort, which

00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:18.470
is the cohort that received
automatic enrollment.

00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:23.240
The difference is dramatic
from like 37% to 86%.

00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:26.630
And this is now by
compensation levels of workers.

00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:28.880
And what you see here
is, in the window cohort,

00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.800
you see this huge gradient
here by compensation.

00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.870
So workers who are--
and this is before

00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:37.310
the automatic enrollment.

00:52:37.310 --> 00:52:41.330
Workers who received
fewer than $20,000

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:45.350
per year, only 12.5%
of them actually

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.110
were participating in 401(k)
savings to start with.

00:52:48.110 --> 00:52:51.230
And among people who earned
a lot already anyway,

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.047
this thing was, like, 68%.

00:52:53.047 --> 00:52:54.380
There's a huge discrepancy here.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:00.300
And this is precisely where
the IRS discrimination

00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:01.490
rules were [? fighting. ?]

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:04.310
Now, but if you look at
after the enrollment,

00:53:04.310 --> 00:53:06.740
there's still-- notice that
there's still some gradient.

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.770
There's still, essentially,
like, a higher participation

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:11.930
rate among the high
paid employees.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:14.480
But the grading is much
flatter, because essentially,

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:19.670
so many among the low income
workers or low wage workers

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:21.780
are now enrolled as well.

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.620
So there's huge effect, and the
effective is disproportionately

00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:28.070
large among low income workers.

00:53:28.070 --> 00:53:31.140
What are potential
reasons for that?

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.528
So they have more likely--

00:53:32.528 --> 00:53:34.070
essentially, their
credit constraints

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:35.240
are more likely to bind.

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.490
Or they have a high
marginal utility of money,

00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:40.340
and therefore, they might
be less inclined to save.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.140
Notice that low
income workers also

00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:45.227
have a high marginal utility
of income in the future.

00:53:45.227 --> 00:53:47.060
So in some ways, it's
not obvious, actually,

00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.920
that when you think about--
[? because when you ?] write

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:51.650
down a model, you think about
should you save right now

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:54.835
versus consume money--

00:53:54.835 --> 00:53:58.030
so consume versus save.

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:00.740
You will get, essentially, what
this-- what this depends on

00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:03.350
is the ratio of your
marginal utility right now

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:04.970
versus in the future.

00:54:04.970 --> 00:54:07.430
And the marginal utility of
poor workers in the future

00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:08.347
will also be high.

00:54:08.347 --> 00:54:10.430
So it's not obvious that
they shouldn't be saving.

00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:11.330
But I think it's
right that we're

00:54:11.330 --> 00:54:12.747
saying they have
more emergencies,

00:54:12.747 --> 00:54:16.290
and more reasons to essentially
not want the money right now.

00:54:16.290 --> 00:54:19.770
So one thing could be just it's
mechanical in the sense of,

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.190
in some ways, it could just
be that for whatever reason,

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:25.010
the poor are not
saving to start with.

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:26.690
Maybe that's in
part due to tenure.

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:28.550
Maybe it's due to
some other reasons

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:33.380
that we don't quite understand.

00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:37.370
But it might also be
that the poor might

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:41.650
be more prone to default
effects, which could be in part

00:54:41.650 --> 00:54:42.680
what Carmen was saying.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:45.620
They're sort of--
in a way, perhaps

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.170
financial sophistication,
or education,

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:50.420
or information-- just what's
the right thing to do--

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.410
might be lower.

00:54:51.410 --> 00:54:52.430
And you might, as
in, like, I don't

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:53.460
understand what's going on.

00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.980
So I'm just doing what
the company does for me

00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:56.240
and just hope for the best.

00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:58.340
And then you might
just go with whatever

00:54:58.340 --> 00:55:01.370
that is, and you're less
confident in making different--

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:04.022
or overriding such choices.

00:55:04.022 --> 00:55:05.480
Another explanation--
and I'm going

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.710
to talk about this when we
talk about poverty a bit--

00:55:07.710 --> 00:55:11.660
which is the idea that poverty
taxes people's bandwidth

00:55:11.660 --> 00:55:12.360
and attention.

00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.735
That's to say,
like, essentially,

00:55:13.735 --> 00:55:15.727
being poor is really
hard in various ways.

00:55:15.727 --> 00:55:17.810
You have to struggle with
so many different things

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:19.670
about paying your bills,
and so on and so forth,

00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:21.670
which is precisely kind
of what Jose [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:23.800
was saying in part.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:25.807
Your marginal utility
of money might be high,

00:55:25.807 --> 00:55:27.390
and you're really
concerned with that.

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:29.840
And you worried about
feeding your children,

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.203
and so on and so forth.

00:55:31.203 --> 00:55:32.870
And it's just really
hard to find a time

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:35.045
to think about stuff carefully.

00:55:35.045 --> 00:55:36.920
And therefore, you might,
again, sort of just

00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.682
go with the default.
Because you just

00:55:38.682 --> 00:55:40.640
don't have the bandwidth--
the mental bandwidth

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:46.250
to think about what's best
for you and override that.

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:47.750
So that's an open
question, in fact,

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:52.250
whether the poor are more likely
to be prone to default effects.

00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:56.570
But I think what's almost
surely the case, or what's

00:55:56.570 --> 00:55:59.510
been shown in various studies,
is that these effects tend

00:55:59.510 --> 00:56:02.630
to have larger effects
among poor, low compensation

00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:04.820
workers, which is precisely
one of the reasons

00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:08.840
why they were so
popular overall.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.230
OK, so then in
addition, not only

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:15.770
are there large effects on the
contribution decision overall.

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:18.890
It's like, do you want your the
participation decision overall?

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:21.170
Do you want to
participate versus not?

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:24.720
Like, do you want to contribute
any money versus not?

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.650
But also there seem to be large
effects on the contribution

00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:28.740
rate.

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.250
That is to say, I
think I told you--

00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:35.037
remember, I told you the default
contribution rate was 3%.

00:56:35.037 --> 00:56:36.620
So if you were
automatically enrolled,

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:42.200
the company would just give
you a 3% contribution standard.

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:45.810
You could change that to 4%,
2%, 7%, whatever you want to do.

00:56:45.810 --> 00:56:48.230
But the default would be 3%.

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:51.220
And you see, essentially,
the majority of people--

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.780
the fraction of employees
in the new cohort,

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:58.253
which is the automatic
enrollment, chooses 3%.

00:56:58.253 --> 00:57:00.420
There's another thing that's
quite interesting here.

00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:03.860
What you see is that
among people who

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:05.462
arguably would have chosen--

00:57:05.462 --> 00:57:07.045
if you just look at
the window cohort,

00:57:07.045 --> 00:57:09.530
there's some people, for
example, who chose 6%.

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:12.800
11% of people in
the window cohort--

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.980
that's the cohort that was
just before the automatic

00:57:15.980 --> 00:57:17.030
enrollment--

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:21.470
11% of people chose 6%.

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:24.590
That fraction actually
goes down to 7%.

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:28.640
That is to say, some people
would have chosen more than 3%

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:30.560
in the absence of
automatic enrollment,

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.055
now they are moving down to 3%.

00:57:33.055 --> 00:57:34.430
So there is some
effect-- there's

00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:37.855
a bunch of mass coming
from 0% moving to 3%.

00:57:37.855 --> 00:57:39.230
But there's also
some mass coming

00:57:39.230 --> 00:57:41.000
from here that moves
from, essentially,

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.910
positive amounts down to 3%.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:46.250
So there's sort of very
heterogeneous effect.

00:57:46.250 --> 00:57:47.840
Some people, or
quite a few people,

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:50.840
increased their savings from
very low rates, or 0 rates,

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:51.393
to 3%.

00:57:51.393 --> 00:57:53.810
But there's always another
other effect that, essentially,

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:56.630
some people who would
have sat down and done

00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:58.730
the choice themselves,
they would have probably

00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:01.410
chosen something like
6%, 7%, whatever,

00:58:01.410 --> 00:58:05.570
even 15%, and some of
them have moved down to 3%

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:07.680
by the automatic enrollment.

00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.960
So there's some negative
effect on savings

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:13.350
coming from that, potentially.

00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:18.860
In addition, the asset
allocation, here,

00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:23.410
people essentially predominantly
just choose the default.

00:58:23.410 --> 00:58:27.450
Here you see, essentially,
the assets or stocks, bonds,

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:28.420
and money market.

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.190
Think about money market
essentially as like a 0%--

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:32.720
or a close to 0%--

00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:36.370
very safe option.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:39.740
And in the new cohort,
80% of people--

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.680
I'm not sure how well you can
see this-- but 80% of people

00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:44.660
choose the money market,
which essentially

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:47.960
is exactly what the company
is choosing for them.

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:50.090
Well, if you have--

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:51.710
in the other
cohorts, this is all

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:53.390
conditional on participating.

00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:59.170
The fraction who chooses stocks
and bonds is way, way higher.

00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:02.580
And as we discussed,
the long-run return

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.730
to investing in the money
market is way, way lower.

00:59:05.730 --> 00:59:10.350
So that's potentially,
again, another reason why--

00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:12.660
in fact, why defaults
aren't increasing

00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:15.420
the faction of people that
are choosing to save overall,

00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.710
or to participate on
the savings overall.

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:22.330
The long-run savings might
not necessarily be high.

00:59:22.330 --> 00:59:23.920
Now, let me summarize this.

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.290
I think I said,
already, most of this.

00:59:26.290 --> 00:59:29.858
So 40% to 50% of individuals
are passive savers,

00:59:29.858 --> 00:59:31.150
as you might want to call them.

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:33.170
They follow the default plan.

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.680
They essentially-- both in
terms of the participation,

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.872
but also on the contribution
rate and the asset

00:59:37.872 --> 00:59:39.580
allocation-- they
essentially do whatever

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:43.596
the company chooses for them.

00:59:43.596 --> 00:59:46.880
The suggestive choice
is not very attractive

00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:49.580
unless it's the default.
Notice-- remember,

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:50.510
the window cohort.

00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:51.927
The window cohort
were essentially

00:59:51.927 --> 00:59:55.660
the cohort that now could just
do whatever they wanted to do.

00:59:55.660 --> 01:00:00.760
They were told on the 1st of
April, I think, '97 or '98,

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:03.552
now you can invest immediately.

01:00:03.552 --> 01:00:04.760
You can do whatever you want.

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:07.163
We're not choosing for you,
but you are now eligible,

01:00:07.163 --> 01:00:09.580
even for people who have been
at the company for something

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.538
like, say, six months,
three months, and so on.

01:00:11.538 --> 01:00:14.230
The company just made
the participation

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:15.550
available to anybody.

01:00:15.550 --> 01:00:17.140
Since they had been
hired previously,

01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:18.658
they didn't default people in.

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.950
They just made it, like, you
can change your choice now

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:21.920
if you wanted.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.830
But among those people,
the window cohort

01:00:23.830 --> 01:00:25.870
is very much looking
like the old cohort.

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:28.478
They're not sort of following
the company [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:28.478 --> 01:00:30.770
You might say, well, the
company has a new default now.

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:33.073
And the new default,
that's a recommendation,

01:00:33.073 --> 01:00:34.990
so I should just follow
that default because I

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:36.290
don't know what to do.

01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:37.840
That's not what
people seem to do.

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.520
So it's not like
that-- so there doesn't

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.340
seem to be that the default is a
perceived choice that's suggest

01:00:44.340 --> 01:00:46.990
[INAUDIBLE] company, because the
window cohort really does not

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:50.530
follow this default or
the suggested default.

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:54.023
The window cohort really
looks like the old cohort.

01:00:54.023 --> 01:00:55.440
Now, I only showed
you the results

01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:57.080
for one company for
Madrian and Shea.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:00.030
But it's a very robust result
that, if you look at the paper

01:01:00.030 --> 01:01:01.140
by Choi et al.

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:04.380
that looks at this in more
detail, that finds this

01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:06.560
over and over again in
different companies as well,

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:10.523
default effects tend to be
very strong in those companies.

01:01:10.523 --> 01:01:11.940
Now one question
you might ask is,

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:14.400
what's explaining-- what's
the underlying reason why

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.730
these default effects
are so strong?

01:01:17.730 --> 01:01:19.230
There are potential
candidates which

01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:22.110
are awareness, implicit
endorsement by the company,

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:26.310
inattention/memory, or
potentially present bias.

01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:29.370
And what researchers
found, it's sort of not

01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:30.630
necessarily conclusive.

01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:33.090
But I think the suggestive
evidence is very much that--

01:01:33.090 --> 01:01:34.920
and particularly from
Blumenstock et al.,

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:37.470
that we think that
present bias might

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:41.430
be a quite important
reason, in addition

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:43.710
to the cognitive
costs of thinking

01:01:43.710 --> 01:01:45.760
through different
savings scenarios.

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.820
So people essentially
tend to push this off

01:01:47.820 --> 01:01:50.250
and say, oh, I'm going to
change it in the future.

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:51.970
At some point, I'll get to it.

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:54.000
I'll get to it when
it's important.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.520
Notice that it
requires some naiveté,

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.460
because as we discussed,
if you were sophisticated,

01:01:59.460 --> 01:02:02.400
you might of push it off
maybe a period or two.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:05.070
But you would never push it
off by 10 years, or five years,

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:08.490
because you know you're
going to lose a lot of money.

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:11.130
But if you have some present
bias plus some naiveté,

01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:14.940
you might say, well, I'm going
to do it in the future and not

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.380
right now.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:21.240
And that seems to fit the
data the best, in part

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.360
because papers such as the
one by Blumenstock et al.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:26.192
have ruled out some
other explanation,

01:02:26.192 --> 01:02:28.025
for example, the
inattention/memory stories.

01:02:28.025 --> 01:02:29.280
They set reminders.

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:31.020
That didn't seem
to have an effect.

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:34.488
They also could rule out
the implicit endorsement,

01:02:34.488 --> 01:02:36.405
because they essentially
explicitly randomized

01:02:36.405 --> 01:02:39.660
the people who were defaulted
in versus defaulted out.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.070
That also had effects.

01:02:41.070 --> 01:02:42.630
So it doesn't seem to be that.

01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:44.940
They also made
people very clearly

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:48.540
aware of the different
retirement savings options.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:51.710
And again, that didn't
seem to make a big effect.

01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:54.300
So while we don't have
conclusive evidence that

01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:58.020
present bias is sort of
causing these default defects,

01:02:58.020 --> 01:03:00.057
in the retirement
savings choice scheme,

01:03:00.057 --> 01:03:02.640
perhaps if I had to guess, or
if I had to say which I think is

01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:05.020
the most likely explanation,
we think that present bias

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:11.720
and naiveté seem to be the
best explanations that we have

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.240
so far.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.140
So now, one question you
might sort of say is, well,

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.565
is automatic enrollment optimal?

01:03:20.565 --> 01:03:22.190
I showed you,
essentially, that once we

01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:25.910
do automatic enrollment, people
are more likely to participate.

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:29.650
However, while they're
more likely to participate,

01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:34.780
also these defaults seem to make
some people save less, right?

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:36.280
We saw some people
going essentially

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.370
from 6% participation--

01:03:38.370 --> 01:03:41.150
contribution rate to
3% contribution rate.

01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:45.200
They also have a much more
conservative asset allocation.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.870
So in the long run,
it's not obvious,

01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:49.930
in the case of this company,
whether people are actually

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:52.330
saving more.

01:03:52.330 --> 01:03:55.220
Now, so how would we
answer this question?

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:57.740
We're going to get back to
this when we talk about policy.

01:03:57.740 --> 01:04:00.520
But how should we
set the default?

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:01.990
What should we do?

01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:03.850
What are the considerations
that we have?

01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:06.175
And how can we decide
what's good for people?

01:04:06.175 --> 01:04:10.353
You can essentially force
people to make a choice.

01:04:10.353 --> 01:04:12.520
There were some companies
where, essentially, people

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.220
were very, very strongly
encouraged to-- essentially,

01:04:15.220 --> 01:04:15.980
here's a form.

01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:16.480
Fill it out.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:17.590
Tell me what you want.

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:19.510
And was sort of part
of the hiring package,

01:04:19.510 --> 01:04:21.970
and essentially was
sort of arguing--

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:23.470
I don't think that's
actually legal.

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:26.550
But it was essentially sort of
implying that one [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:28.580
to doing this form before
you can start working,

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:31.033
and otherwise, you can't
start working at this company.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:32.950
And now, we can look at,
like, what are people

01:04:32.950 --> 01:04:35.620
actually choosing when
everybody chooses actively?

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.360
And that's presumably when
people are paying attention,

01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:41.080
or maybe people do the best
they can for their choices,

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.150
and they're not
automatically enrolled

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:46.250
either in 0%, or 3%,
or other percentages.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.590
And so this paper
for by Carroll et al.

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:50.330
looks attractive choices.

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:52.190
And when people
choose actively, they

01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:55.310
look a lot like the new
cohort in Madrian and Shea.

01:04:55.310 --> 01:04:56.810
So essentially,
that's sort of seems

01:04:56.810 --> 01:05:00.920
to say that the default
did in fact-- the default

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:05.210
into automatic enrollment
seemed to have alleviated

01:05:05.210 --> 01:05:07.460
undersavings.

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:08.960
Because when people
choose actively,

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.240
they choose a lot-- look
a lot like the new cohort

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.530
compared to the old cohort.

01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:14.480
It seems to be that
people, when they're

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:17.290
defaulted in the no savings
option, they kind of maybe

01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:20.670
think, oh, I'll do it in the
future, and so on and so forth.

01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:23.138
But then they never
sort of get to it.

01:05:23.138 --> 01:05:25.430
Now, when you actually ask
them actually what you want,

01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:29.820
it seems like people are
mostly wanting to enroll.

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:31.650
Now, one thing that
is quite interesting

01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:35.430
here is that it seems like the
default effects seem to mostly

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:36.870
disappear after three years.

01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:41.450
That's true for
quite a few studies.

01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:43.008
However, even if
that's the case,

01:05:43.008 --> 01:05:44.800
well, there's no catch-up
in levels, right?

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:49.800
So if you start contributing
after three years, while you

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.390
miss out on three
years of savings,

01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:53.190
you're never going
to catch up overall.

01:05:53.190 --> 01:05:57.330
Moreover, people tend to
change their employers

01:05:57.330 --> 01:05:59.730
very frequently,
particularly in the US.

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:01.590
So if it takes you only--

01:06:01.590 --> 01:06:04.620
if it takes you three years to
sign up for retirement savings

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.870
every time you
switch your employer,

01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:09.940
you're going to
not save very much.

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.210
Chetty et al had an example
where they find, in fact,

01:06:12.210 --> 01:06:16.080
very clear effects on long-run
savings of these types

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:18.400
of default [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:21.962
Now, let me tell you a
little bit now about--

01:06:21.962 --> 01:06:23.920
I'm going to sort of move
the frames and nudges

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.462
until next time, which I think
should be fine because there's

01:06:26.462 --> 01:06:28.150
not that much left anyway.

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.640
But let me tell you a little
bit about a cautionary tale

01:06:30.640 --> 01:06:32.650
about defaults.

01:06:32.650 --> 01:06:35.250
This is a paper by-- a very
short paper by Cronqvist

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:38.080
and Thaler that looks
at the privatization

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:40.150
of social security in Sweden.

01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:42.170
So they had 456 funds.

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:45.580
And there was one default
fund chosen by the government.

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.220
And in 2000, this
default fund was

01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.410
discouraged with a massive
marketing campaign.

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:53.020
Essentially people said, like,
don't choose the default fund.

01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.490
Just pick for yourself.

01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:56.810
Make the choice that's
the best for you.

01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:59.230
And then in 2003, this
marketing campaign ended.

01:06:59.230 --> 01:07:01.330
And now essentially,
the majority, again,

01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:08.130
sort of chose the
default account or fund.

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:12.600
Now, as it happens, the
portfolios actively chosen

01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.750
in 2000 did a lot
worse than the default.

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:21.347
So people, essentially,
were choosing on their own.

01:07:21.347 --> 01:07:23.430
And in part, I think because
they're just unlucky,

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:26.790
because it happened to be at the
wrong time and the wrong place,

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:28.770
chose sort of very risky assets.

01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:31.390
And the default tended to be
somewhat more conservative.

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:34.630
So people lost a lot of money.

01:07:34.630 --> 01:07:36.270
So now, that's the
more general issue

01:07:36.270 --> 01:07:39.600
is that active choice is less
attractive if consumers are

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.370
less financially sophisticated.

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:43.170
Again, in the Cronqvist
and Thaler case,

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:44.378
maybe they were just unlucky.

01:07:44.378 --> 01:07:46.710
But in general, if you want
people to choose actively

01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:48.335
and they don't know
what they're doing,

01:07:48.335 --> 01:07:51.235
well, then they're going
to be potentially worse.

01:07:51.235 --> 01:07:52.860
There is similar
evidence, for example,

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:55.027
for health care insurance
choices, where people just

01:07:55.027 --> 01:07:57.730
don't know what health insurance
choice is best for them.

01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:00.240
So you can give
them more options,

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:04.183
they might be potentially
doing worse, because they just

01:08:04.183 --> 01:08:05.100
don't know what to do.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.933
And then they choose
options that are worse,

01:08:06.933 --> 01:08:09.610
and they're more likely, for
example, to be exploited.

01:08:09.610 --> 01:08:12.840
And then, having a default
choice that is perhaps not

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.450
optimal for everybody, but it's
pretty conservative and pretty

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:19.104
good for most people, might
be, in fact, quite valuable.

01:08:19.104 --> 01:08:20.479
And so now, when
you think about,

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:25.720
like, optimal
decision regimes, when

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.910
you think of an active
choice versus default,

01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:32.270
consumer heterogeneity makes
active choice more attractive.

01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:35.770
If you think people want
very different things,

01:08:35.770 --> 01:08:38.040
and they know about
what's best for them,

01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.580
and we don't have
that information--

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.130
we don't know what's good for
some people versus others--

01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:44.290
well, it's best to let
people choose on their own.

01:08:44.290 --> 01:08:45.998
Let's let them pick
what's good for them,

01:08:45.998 --> 01:08:49.410
and then they'll be happy.

01:08:49.410 --> 01:08:52.335
But active choice only
improves the outcome

01:08:52.335 --> 01:08:54.210
if people actually know
what's good for them.

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:55.710
If everybody is
confused and doesn't

01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:57.359
know what they're
doing, well then,

01:08:57.359 --> 01:09:00.180
letting people choose
actively will potentially

01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:03.380
make things worse for
quite a few people.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.880
And so you want to make sure
that defaults don't make people

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:06.450
worse off.

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:07.658
This is what Jose was saying.

01:09:07.658 --> 01:09:09.600
In particular, people
might sort of oversave

01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.758
if you default them
into high savings.

01:09:11.758 --> 01:09:13.800
And then they have credit
card debt or other sort

01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:15.680
of problems arising from that.

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.790
So we want to be quite careful.

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:21.240
One option one can try and do
is try to provide information

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.330
sessions and make sure
people know, here's--

01:09:23.330 --> 01:09:26.609
or trying to sort of provide
a curated set of three, four

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:28.350
options that we think
are good options

01:09:28.350 --> 01:09:31.439
for different types of people,
provide information for them,

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:34.560
make sure they
understand these options,

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:38.013
and that then people
choose on their own.

01:09:38.013 --> 01:09:40.430
Another popular alternative--
I'm going to talk about this

01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.170
a little bit when we
talk about policy--

01:09:42.170 --> 01:09:43.878
which is called the
smart plan, or, like,

01:09:43.878 --> 01:09:47.330
auto-escalation plans, which are
essentially more like automatic

01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:55.310
raises in the future,
where you essentially

01:09:55.310 --> 01:09:57.200
can commit to
automatically raising

01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:00.500
your savings in the future.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.590
You say, essentially, every
time I get a pay raise, 1%,

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.240
or some fraction
of that pay raise,

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:07.880
or one percentage point of my
earnings of that pay raise,

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.070
will go through my savings.

01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:14.690
So then, you don't
have to reduce

01:10:14.690 --> 01:10:18.770
your consumption or your salary
right now that you receive,

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:19.970
but in the future.

01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:20.860
That's good.

01:10:20.860 --> 01:10:23.870
In particular, it addresses
present bias and loss aversion.

01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:26.810
Because people are really averse
to reducing their paycheck

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:30.485
right now, and for present
bias and loss aversion reasons.

01:10:30.485 --> 01:10:32.180
When I was asking
about information

01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.760
versus financial education,
I mean kind of both of those.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.150
You can find information about
what are these options, what's

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.370
good about this investment
option versus another,

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:43.610
and so providing
financial education,

01:10:43.610 --> 01:10:48.470
but in particular, financial
education plus active choice.

01:10:48.470 --> 01:10:50.540
Essentially, by
active choice, I mean

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:52.580
pushing people really
to choose, and saying,

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:53.805
look, what do you want?

01:10:53.805 --> 01:10:57.260
Do you want option A,
which is no retirement

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.520
savings, or option B, which is
like 3%, or 6%, or whatever.

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.650
The current format is more--

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:06.110
essentially, is,
like, no information,

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:09.030
and the default is
essentially 0 savings.

01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:11.270
And then, you have to
actively choose on your own

01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.910
as an employer.

01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:14.660
And many employees--
sorry, as an employee.

01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.410
Many employees just don't know
what to do, and get confused.

01:11:18.410 --> 01:11:20.660
And then they get frazzled,
and then procrastinate it,

01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:24.240
and then never do it, perhaps
in part because of confusion.

01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.130
OK, and then other settings
have enormous before the fact.

01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:30.200
This is, for example,
true for organ donations.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:33.920
I talked about this already in
the first or second lecture.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:39.080
There's some other settings
such as voter registration,

01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:41.100
green energy options, and so on.

01:11:41.100 --> 01:11:44.840
So default effects can be
really, really powerful.

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:47.840
But one wants to be quite
careful in using them.

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:50.870
I'm going to talk
about this a little bit

01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:52.900
at the end of this
lecture next time.

01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.090
Let me stop here.

01:11:54.090 --> 01:12:04.366
Let me just tell you what to
read, which is-- one second--

01:12:04.366 --> 01:12:09.610
which is the paper by Ariely et
al., sections one through four.

01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:13.390
You can read more if you want,
but section one through four

01:12:13.390 --> 01:12:14.740
already gets you pretty far.

01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:17.770
This is really a fun
paper that questions

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:21.610
a lot of assumptions of
neoclassical economics,

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:24.350
makes you wonder where
preferences come from

01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:26.750
and what they really mean.

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:28.390
So it's a fun read.

01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:31.540
I'll talk about this in
the remaining part of this

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:34.330
lecture-- which is a bit
on frames and nudges--

01:12:34.330 --> 01:12:37.810
more generally next
time on Wednesday.

01:12:37.810 --> 01:12:39.860
Let me know if you
have any questions.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:41.730
Thank you so much.

00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:26.760
PROFESSOR: I.e.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.090
When multiple lineages
of beneficial mutants

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.790
are kind of spreading in a
population at the same time,

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.660
so when these clones
are somehow interfering

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.550
with each other
in the population,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.110
how is it that that
clonal interference effect

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.035
kind of plays out in the context
of these microbial asexual

00:00:42.035 --> 00:00:42.535
populations.

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:45.720
And in particular,
in this paper, what

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.700
they were trying to measure
was the distribution of effects

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.390
of beneficial mutations.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.650
So you've put a population
into some new environment.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.540
There may be some beneficial
mutations that are possible.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.270
The question is, what is
the probability distribution

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.732
of effects of those
beneficial mutations.

00:01:01.732 --> 00:01:04.000
And this is, as
you might imagine,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.460
a very basic quantitative
we'd like to understand just

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.574
to understand how evolution
works in new environments.

00:01:10.574 --> 00:01:11.990
But it's actually
something that's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.156
rather difficult to measure.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.130
And what's interesting
here is it's

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.960
difficult to measure for
maybe a surprising reason.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.160
This is a wonderful example
of how you kind of-- if life

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.370
gives you lemons,
then make lemonade.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.066
Is that the expression?

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:30.953
OK.

00:01:30.953 --> 00:01:31.452
All right.

00:01:31.452 --> 00:01:34.090
So in this paper, they
set out to try and measure

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.450
the [? distribution ?] effects
of beneficial mutations.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.227
They were unsuccessful.

00:01:39.227 --> 00:01:41.435
But they were unsuccessful
for an interesting reason,

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:43.336
so then they were able
to write what I think

00:01:43.336 --> 00:01:47.304
is a very nice science paper.

00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:50.215
Are there any
questions about where

00:01:50.215 --> 00:01:52.590
we are or administrative
things before we get going?

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.610
All right, so just to recap
where we were from last time,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.990
we introduced this
Moran model, which

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.650
there's a fixed
population size, N.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.650
Then each of these sort
of cycles, what we do

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.210
is we choose one
individual to divide

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.725
and we choose one
individual to be replaced.

00:02:17.725 --> 00:02:23.830
And we have the daughter, say,
cell replace the cell that

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.150
was chosen for replacement.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.690
Now in that model,
what we found was

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.560
that there's some
probability, x1,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.500
for a new mutant with
relative fitness,

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.040
r, to actually fix
in the population.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.850
And this is in the case
of no clonal interference.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.740
So CI will in general be
clonal interference today.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.170
So this is-- if it's
just this one mutation

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.590
that we're considering, then
the question of surviving

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.750
stochastic extinction
kind of at the beginning

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.190
is equivalent to the
question of being

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.610
able to fix in the
population certainly

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.490
for a beneficial mutation,
with r greater than 1.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.360
So what we want to do
today to just start

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.890
is to try to think
about how we can

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.980
use this model and
this equation in order

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.578
to understand the
probability of fixation

00:03:17.578 --> 00:03:19.744
when there's more than one
mutant in the population.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.080
So here, what we found
is that this thing,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.730
there are 2 limits that we
might want to keep track of.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:41.020
So this thing goes to 1 over
n, for neutral mutations,

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.470
and it goes to S for moderately
beneficial mutations.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:57.140
So S is defined as r minus 1.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:58.990
So it's this for
S kind of greater

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:04.145
than zero, and for S times
n, much larger than 1.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.756
So I guess this already says
that S is greater than zero,

00:04:13.756 --> 00:04:14.755
so we could ignore that.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.779
Are there any questions
about this before we

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:26.075
get going to practice using it?

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:29.440
All right, so I just
wanted to have us consider

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.365
a few possible situations.

00:04:35.138 --> 00:04:37.480
All right, population size 10.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.290
What we want to consider
a situation where

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.550
there are two mutants.

00:04:44.414 --> 00:04:49.760
And we're going to call them A
and B, with relative fitness rA

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:55.315
1.01, and rB 0.99.

00:04:55.315 --> 00:05:00.030
So A is a beneficial mutant,
and B is a deleterious mutant.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.640
And in all these
problems, we're going

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.740
to assume that the rest of
the population has fitness 1.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.114
So these fitnesses
of A and B, they

00:05:08.114 --> 00:05:10.030
are as compared to the
rest of the population.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.680
So in this case, there are
eight other individuals

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.765
with relative fitness 1.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.340
So the question is, what is
the probability that a fixes.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.950
Takes over the population.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.120
Reaches number of A
individuals equal to 10.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.800
At that stage, we're not
allowing for any new mutations

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.765
here, so then that's
the end of the dynamics.

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:41.670
So you can start
thinking about it,

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.980
and I will give
some options here.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.619
All right so this is
in the Moran model,

00:06:10.619 --> 00:06:12.160
what is the probability
that A fixes.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.028
I'll give you 20 seconds
to think about it.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.460
Do you need more time?

00:06:51.314 --> 00:06:53.230
Let's go ahead and vote,
and see where we are.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.840
Ready.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.165
Three, two, one--

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:06.100
All right, we got some-- I'd
say Bs, Cs is kind of dominant.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.900
All right.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.150
So I'd say that there's
generally a disagreement

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:14.852
between B and C. Interesting.

00:07:14.852 --> 00:07:16.320
OK.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.520
I think that there's--
it's almost 50/50.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.700
It is a bit splotchy, somehow.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.135
You may need to make some effort
to find somebody that disagrees

00:07:24.135 --> 00:07:25.260
with you, but please do so.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.510
All right, turn to a neighbor
and try to convince them

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.716
that you're right.

00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:34.684
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:08:36.218 --> 00:08:39.194
PROFESSOR: All right, let's
go ahead and reconvene and see

00:08:39.194 --> 00:08:42.250
if anybody [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.200
Ready.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.692
Three, two, one.

00:08:47.692 --> 00:08:49.580
All right.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:51.660
I'd say that there's
some migration towards C,

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:56.170
but it's not all the way.

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.320
All right, different arguments.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:03.024
And you may want to-- D is the
argument to be made over here.

00:09:03.024 --> 00:09:04.190
All right, so let's hear it.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.618
So if there's one
individual from A

00:09:06.618 --> 00:09:09.764
and one individual from
B, and basically they're

00:09:09.764 --> 00:09:12.250
about the same fitness,
then the probability

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.729
that they should, I
guess, take over is 50%.

00:09:15.729 --> 00:09:18.214
Well that assumes that one
of them will take over.

00:09:18.214 --> 00:09:18.936
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
is there any reason

00:09:18.936 --> 00:09:20.769
to assume that one of
them should take over?

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:22.687
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:22.687 --> 00:09:25.120
PROFESSOR: I think that we
may agree that the probability

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.105
that A fixes is going
to be approximately

00:09:27.105 --> 00:09:29.249
equal to the probability
that B fixes.

00:09:29.249 --> 00:09:30.748
That's going to be
a useful insight.

00:09:30.748 --> 00:09:32.740
But [INAUDIBLE]
both those things.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.732
So we have to keep
track of that.

00:09:34.732 --> 00:09:38.995
So that's the argument
for why it's not D.

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:40.210
AUDIENCE: You're welcome.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.420
PROFESSOR: Anytime. [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:46.590
So between B and C, how
can we think about this?

00:09:49.415 --> 00:09:51.540
You can tell us once again
what your neighbor said.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.040
That's fine.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.726
AUDIENCE: Why?

00:09:52.726 --> 00:09:53.350
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.495
AUDIENCE: Um, well, my
neighbor, as opposed to me,

00:09:57.495 --> 00:10:01.068
made the correct decision to try
to think about it intuitively

00:10:01.068 --> 00:10:02.984
instead of trying to get
through all the math.

00:10:02.984 --> 00:10:03.764
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:10:03.764 --> 00:10:05.930
Always good to think about
things intuitively rather

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.090
than-- that's--

00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:08.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.210
So A is very
slightly beneficial,

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:14.910
and so it is just
a little bit more

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.392
likely to fix than
a neutral mutation.

00:10:17.392 --> 00:10:21.110
PROFESSOR: OK, and how can
we quantify this statement?

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.486
That I know I said that I
didn't like math, but you know,

00:10:23.486 --> 00:10:25.151
every now and then
we should look at it.

00:10:25.151 --> 00:10:27.380
Yeah, so this statement
that A is approximately

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.130
a neutral mutation.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.878
How is it that we can--
how do we know that?

00:10:31.878 --> 00:10:32.832
I mean did--

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:35.217
AUDIENCE: We have criteria
for nearly neutral.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:37.580
PROFESSOR: Yes, we have a
criteria for nearly neutral.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.913
What does that-- what does
it mean to be nearly neutral?

00:10:39.913 --> 00:10:42.632
AUDIENCE: The
magnitude of S times N

00:10:42.632 --> 00:10:44.361
is much, much less than one.

00:10:44.361 --> 00:10:45.360
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.360
S times N is much
less than one, which

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.690
means that it's nearly neutral.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.180
What that means is that
the probability of fixing

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.610
is the same as if it
were a neutral mutation,

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.218
or approximately the same.

00:10:59.218 --> 00:11:01.548
And is that the case here?

00:11:01.548 --> 00:11:02.480
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.412
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:06.460
S is 0.01, so 1/100.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.780
N is 10.

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:11.660
So S times N is equal to 0.1.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.212
Which means that both-- so
A is maybe nearly neutral.

00:11:15.212 --> 00:11:16.045
Is B nearly neutral?

00:11:16.045 --> 00:11:16.740
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.430
PROFESSOR: Yes, so both A
and B are nearly neutral.

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:22.110
One of them is an advantageous
mutant, one is a deleterious.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:24.390
But in this
population size, they

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.420
both behave as if
they're nearly neutral.

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:29.110
But in a larger
population, so if

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:30.245
we had a million
individuals, would these

00:11:30.245 --> 00:11:31.119
be neutral mutations?

00:11:31.119 --> 00:11:31.706
AUDIENCE: No.

00:11:31.706 --> 00:11:33.840
PROFESSOR: No.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.110
So the question of
whether something behaves

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.021
as a neutral mutation depends
upon the population size

00:11:39.021 --> 00:11:40.360
via this relation.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:47.345
So that's-- and then
how do we go from there?

00:11:47.345 --> 00:11:52.676
AUDIENCE: Well the probability
of a neutral mutation

00:11:52.676 --> 00:11:54.946
[INAUDIBLE] population
is going to be [? 1/S ?].

00:11:54.946 --> 00:11:55.946
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:11:55.946 --> 00:11:58.786
A neutral mutation will fix
a probability of one group.

00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:02.540
So indeed, we're
going to get this.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:05.950
And we need to
highlight that we can--

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.510
you have to be very careful
about just sticking things

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.530
into formulas.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.460
So you may remember
that the probability

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.050
of a beneficial mutant fixing
in the population is S.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.750
But that's only for S times
N being much larger than one,

00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:22.700
and that's when there's
no clonal interference.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.200
When you don't have to compete
with other beneficial mutants

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.810
in the lineage.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.963
We're going to see an
example of this in a moment.

00:12:28.963 --> 00:12:30.463
But if you just
have a single mutant

00:12:30.463 --> 00:12:34.900
in the population, that's
beneficial in the sense of it's

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.390
not neutral.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.740
Then probably the fixation is S.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.420
And of course, this
is nonsensical, right?

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:43.790
Because you can't--
it wouldn't make any--

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.990
certainly it wouldn't--
given that you say oh well,

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:48.448
if it were neutral, it would
fix with a probability of 10%.

00:12:48.448 --> 00:12:50.920
And then you say oh, but if
it's an advantageous mutant,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.776
it can't fix with a
probability less than that.

00:12:54.776 --> 00:12:58.142
So this is nearly neutral,
fixation probability is 10%.

00:12:58.142 --> 00:12:59.975
Are there any questions
about that argument?

00:13:04.725 --> 00:13:09.141
So let's consider a
different problem.

00:13:09.141 --> 00:13:12.943
So now, we're going to consider
a population that's larger.

00:13:12.943 --> 00:13:14.949
So it's going to be the
same situation, where

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:19.928
we have these two mutants
present as single individuals.

00:13:28.401 --> 00:13:30.900
So what we want to know now is
the probability that B fixes.

00:13:37.261 --> 00:13:39.260
Once again, you should
start thinking about this

00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.590
while I type it.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.200
Oh, there was one
other thing I wanted

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.980
to say, actually, over here.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.410
If we modeled these
population dynamics

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:57.240
using differential equations--
so instead of doing the Moran

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.692
process where we stochastic
dynamics of division,

00:14:00.692 --> 00:14:03.150
replacement, and so forth, if
you write down a differential

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.720
equation describing
this situation,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.277
what is the probability
that A fixes?

00:14:09.277 --> 00:14:10.735
I'm going to give
you five seconds.

00:14:10.735 --> 00:14:11.556
AUDIENCE: One.

00:14:11.556 --> 00:14:14.532
PROFESSOR: All right, one.

00:14:14.532 --> 00:14:16.516
OK, so you don't get to vote.

00:14:16.516 --> 00:14:20.062
Indeed, 1.

00:14:20.062 --> 00:14:22.270
So if you had written down
the differential equation,

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.360
then there's no
randomness there.

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.480
Whichever mutant has
the largest fitness

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.535
will fix with probability 1.

00:14:31.535 --> 00:14:32.035
OK?

00:14:35.602 --> 00:14:36.810
OK, probability that B fixes.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.260
So this-- you show
me both [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.541
I'll give you 20, 30
seconds to think about this.

00:15:27.425 --> 00:15:27.925
Yes?

00:15:27.925 --> 00:15:31.066
AUDIENCE: Is there
just one [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:31.066 --> 00:15:32.950
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.250
All right, so this kind
of-- that's why-- yeah.

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:36.416
So it's just the same thing.

00:15:36.416 --> 00:15:42.420
And so that's a single A
mutant and a single B mutant.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:49.298
Single A, single
B. But you should

00:15:49.298 --> 00:15:52.072
know how to calculate these
things if I tell you that they

00:15:52.072 --> 00:15:53.030
were some other number.

00:16:09.214 --> 00:16:10.130
Do you need more time?

00:16:16.804 --> 00:16:19.470
So in general, if you don't look
at me when I ask that question,

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.840
I'm going to take that as
meaning that you're still

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.640
thinking about it.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.196
Is that how I should
interpret that?

00:16:23.196 --> 00:16:23.696
OK.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.930
Let's go ahead and vote just so
that we can see where we are.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.270
OK, ready.

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:54.550
Three, two, one.

00:16:58.486 --> 00:17:00.500
All right.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.730
We're all over the place.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.569
That's great.

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.660
Because that means your
neighbor will either

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.869
be able to help you or
confuse you, or do something.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:13.266
So let's [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:13.266 --> 00:17:15.540
There's a million--
population size 1,000,000.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.849
We have two mutants
in the population.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.619
One has relative fitness
2, one has relative fitness

00:17:20.619 --> 00:17:25.599
of-- an advantage of 1%.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:30.830
One thing to be careful
of here is the equation

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:37.655
that we have for probability
of fixation here-- ah.

00:17:37.655 --> 00:17:39.530
There's one more thing
that I should say.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:43.640
It's for S. Well, it's
an S much less than 1.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:51.390
Just for-- so this is for a
moderately-beneficial mutation.

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:53.931
Otherwise, you have to
use the full approach.

00:17:53.931 --> 00:17:54.925
Yes?

00:17:54.925 --> 00:17:56.416
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:56.416 --> 00:17:57.410
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:17:58.868
Go ahead and turn
to your neighbor,

00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:02.877
and try to convince them
that you've figured this out.

00:18:02.877 --> 00:18:06.853
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:19:32.326 --> 00:19:35.870
PROFESSOR: So everybody
should be talking to somebody.

00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:36.720
What do you think?

00:19:41.067 --> 00:19:45.550
Well it's OK to not know,
but that's why you--

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:49.920
you should either join them,
or if you look behind you,

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:55.610
there's someone else that
looks very, uh-- All right,

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.897
why don't-- let's-- OK.

00:19:56.897 --> 00:19:57.730
Let's-- what's that?

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:00.100
AUDIENCE: I said my reasons
are always good reasons.

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.950
PROFESSOR: They're
always good reasons.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.280
They'll be educational.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:09.560
All right, let's go
ahead and reconvene.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.150
I know that there were a
lot of different guesses

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:15.410
on this problem,
which means maybe

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.060
that the conversations were
scattered or difficult,

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:21.680
or it was difficult to converge.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:24.940
But still, let's see if
it made any difference.

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:25.440
Ready.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.230
Three, two, one.

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:30.064
OK.

00:20:30.064 --> 00:20:30.730
All right, yeah.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.570
So I'd say that the
conversations have helped.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.330
But we're still a
fair distribution

00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:43.370
between maybe A, C, and D still.

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:43.932
But-- yeah.

00:20:43.932 --> 00:20:45.640
Does somebody want to
give an explanation

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:49.592
for one of those three,
or something else?

00:20:49.592 --> 00:20:50.300
Yeah, [? John. ?]

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],
then you know [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:58.310
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:59.730
AUDIENCE: And it indicates
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.150
PROFESSOR: Perfect.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:00.290
OK.

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:01.956
Now I just want to
make sure that we all

00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:02.820
agree on this logic.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:05.590
So if the only thing we
had was the mutation B,

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.900
then the probability of
fixation would be 1% because,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.220
in that case-- is this a
nearly neutral mutation?

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:13.490
No.

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:15.570
So that means that its
probability of fixation

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:19.670
is going to be around
S, in this case, 1.01.

00:21:19.670 --> 00:21:20.430
OK, but--

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:24.595
AUDIENCE: But now A is
there, so you-- first, you

00:21:24.595 --> 00:21:27.290
expect that-- you expect
the probability of B

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:30.720
to fix to be lower than 1%.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:34.150
A fixes in half of the cases.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.170
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.325
AUDIENCE: So in these cases,
[? B's ?] not going to fix.

00:21:37.325 --> 00:21:38.210
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.626
AUDIENCE: So my answer is C,
but I mean, it's a bit of a--

00:21:40.626 --> 00:21:42.447
PROFESSOR: Yeah, no,
no, I mean it's-- no,

00:21:42.447 --> 00:21:44.030
but that's precisely
what's happening.

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:48.680
So for B to fix, it requires
two things to happen.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.760
First, B has to survive
stochastic extinction.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:05.340
And-- so we're going to
multiply these probabilities--

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.130
A doesn't survive.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.320
We're going to discuss in
a moment what this really

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.403
means in terms of surviving
stochastic extinction.

00:22:15.403 --> 00:22:18.090
But when a new mutation
appears in the population,

00:22:18.090 --> 00:22:20.660
it will either relatively
quickly go extinct,

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:23.360
or it will relatively
quickly become established,

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.380
is what we call that.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.755
What that means
is that it will--

00:22:25.755 --> 00:22:27.180
if it's a beneficial
mutation, it

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:30.560
will take over unless it's
outcompeted by someone else.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.470
So it has to be that B
survives stochastic extinction,

00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:39.400
and A doesn't survive
this initial phase.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.080
And this thing-- so that
means that the probability

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:47.552
that B fixes is going
to be-- well, OK.

00:22:47.552 --> 00:22:49.760
The probability that B
survives stochastic extinction

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.004
is going to be 1%.

00:22:53.004 --> 00:22:56.320
The probability that A survives
is 1/2, so the probability

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.820
that it doesn't
survive is also 1/2.

00:23:03.226 --> 00:23:04.850
Now the half, just
to remind ourselves,

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:08.970
comes from this thing x1, for
A. There was this [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.728
This thing is what?

00:23:18.728 --> 00:23:19.644
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:19.644 --> 00:23:20.560
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.540
So this thing very
quickly goes to zero.

00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:25.410
So this is 1/2 to
the millionth power.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:26.860
So that's zero.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:28.320
So we just get 1 minus 1/2.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:39.000
Yes.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.458
AUDIENCE: But what
are we assuming?

00:23:40.458 --> 00:23:42.742
It's not clear to
me in this case.

00:23:42.742 --> 00:23:44.950
Because we're assuming
they're completely independent

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:45.825
and we can multiply--

00:23:45.825 --> 00:23:46.825
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:23:46.825 --> 00:23:47.980
AUDIENCE: Together, so--

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:54.290
And I would say that for--
from the same [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.710
the population of
a million, these

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:00.740
are totally non-interacting
processes, for all intents

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:01.410
and purposes.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:04.460
If you were down to a
population size of 10,

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.132
then you might have
to worry that they're

00:24:07.132 --> 00:24:08.090
going to interact more.

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:13.260
But in this process of--
in this Moran process,

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.997
you have a million individuals.

00:24:14.997 --> 00:24:16.580
It's true that this
is twice as likely

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:18.240
to be chosen to divide
as a normal cell,

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.906
but you're talking
about a million cells

00:24:19.906 --> 00:24:21.500
in that population.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.630
So the correction to the things
that you're worrying about

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:25.970
is a [INAUDIBLE] 10 to the 6.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:28.802
AUDIENCE: And so the
thing [INAUDIBLE], yeah.

00:24:28.802 --> 00:24:33.050
But if rA and rB were closer, I
should [INAUDIBLE] correction--

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:33.980
PROFESSOR: No.

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:38.450
It's not about how close rA
and rB are to each other.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:42.510
Even if they had the exact
same relative fitness.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.332
Even if they were
both 2 or both 1.01,

00:24:44.332 --> 00:24:46.040
then they would still
be non-interacting.

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.565
And that's just because they're
in this sea of individuals.

00:24:48.565 --> 00:24:50.481
AUDIENCE: But the thing
that I'm worried about

00:24:50.481 --> 00:24:52.510
is, for example, rA
could take over quickly,

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:54.810
and then rB could take over.

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:55.650
And that--

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:56.385
PROFESSOR: OK--

00:24:56.385 --> 00:24:57.792
AUDIENCE: Would not be--

00:24:57.792 --> 00:24:58.500
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.070
PROFESSOR: OK so--

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.569
AUDIENCE: And that's
not reasonable.

00:25:01.569 --> 00:25:03.675
[? If this case ?] is rA
[INAUDIBLE], then rB--

00:25:03.675 --> 00:25:05.012
the effective rB--

00:25:05.012 --> 00:25:05.720
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.120
OK So there is one
problem-- You're right.

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:08.190
So I should be careful.

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:11.640
If the two mutants have
exactly the same fitness,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:13.770
then if they both survive
stochastic extinction,

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.410
they're going to-- then
you can describe everything

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.480
as a differential.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.310
And this is the distinction
between this initial phase

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.940
of trying to become
established as

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.710
compared to the later dynamics
in that the established means

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:27.490
that if it's a beneficial
mutation, it will spread,

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.440
and basically deterministically.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.530
So in that situation, if you
had two mutants, and both

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.809
of relative fitness
1.01, then they both

00:25:35.809 --> 00:25:37.600
would try to survive
stochastic extinction.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.974
And let's say that
they both did.

00:25:38.974 --> 00:25:41.870
Then they would both spread in
the population exponentially.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.610
Of course, given that
the initial dynamics

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.144
are stochastic,
then it would still

00:25:46.144 --> 00:25:48.060
be the case that one of
them would just happen

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.340
to be above the other one.

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:52.230
But then they would grow
exponentially together.

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:54.180
That's a more
complicated situation

00:25:54.180 --> 00:25:56.360
than what we're
going to discuss.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.906
And that would
actually be very rare.

00:25:57.906 --> 00:25:59.280
Because each one
of these mutants

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.988
would only have a 1%
chance of surviving.

00:26:00.988 --> 00:26:03.760
So only one in 10 to
the 4 times would you

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:05.417
end up with both
of these mutants

00:26:05.417 --> 00:26:06.750
surviving stochastic extinction.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:15.720
Any other questions about-- so
I just want to be clear here.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:19.336
So this is when A is equal to
1-- the number of A individuals

00:26:19.336 --> 00:26:21.210
is 1, the number of B
individuals equal to 1.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:35.890
There was a question, what if
we started with A equal to 10.

00:26:35.890 --> 00:26:38.830
So let's say the-- yeah.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:39.330
let's?

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:44.190
Say we start with 10A
and 10B, for example.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.415
So instead of starting with just
mutant A and one mutant B, now

00:26:47.415 --> 00:26:49.630
we have 10 of each.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:53.140
So we're changing
things symmetrically.

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:56.660
What's going to be the
probability that B fixes,

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.479
approximately?

00:26:58.479 --> 00:27:00.270
This is going to be a
little funny somehow.

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:04.850
But OK, we'll-- just think
about it for 15 seconds.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.760
What's going to the probability
that B fixes in this case?

00:27:32.624 --> 00:27:35.205
All right, I'm worried you
guys are now even trying.

00:27:38.964 --> 00:27:40.630
AUDIENCE: Could you
repeat the question?

00:27:40.630 --> 00:27:41.560
PROFESSOR: Sure, yeah.

00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:42.970
OK.

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:45.226
So we just did the problem,
we had a single mutant A

00:27:45.226 --> 00:27:47.350
and a single mutant B. And
we found the probability

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.980
that B fixes was 0.005.

00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:52.540
Now I want to know
is, does anything

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:55.022
change instead of having
a single A and single B,

00:27:55.022 --> 00:27:59.910
now what we have is 10 A, 10 B,
and then the rest of them just

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:01.275
being [INAUDIBLE] one.

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:15.890
So it's not fancy math.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.765
But it's still, I can
see, a little confused.

00:28:35.857 --> 00:28:37.440
I just wanted you
to see where we are.

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:44.264
We'll use the same options
here, whatever is closest.

00:28:44.264 --> 00:28:46.430
And we can argue about what
close means in a moment.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:49.715
All right, ready,
three, two, one.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:57.995
So it's kind of some
A's and B's, some E's.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.750
All right.

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:04.390
Well, we'll talk about it.

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.580
All right.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.730
Maybe we'll jump ahead
to the group discussion,

00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:12.430
just because I
don't want to spend

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.680
too much time on this problem.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.420
But these are the
kinds of problems,

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.170
I think, it's very
important to practice with,

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:19.870
because they just
develop your intuition

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:22.119
for the stochastic dynamics
that occur in populations.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.540
It's going to be something
like B. You know,

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.250
that's not why I put B in there.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.580
But let's just see how it goes.

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:35.350
And the way to find
the answer here

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:37.580
is the same as what we did
before, except that now we

00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.700
have to think about these
processes somewhat differently.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.620
So first of all, in
order for B to fix,

00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:46.630
it requires that still B has to
survive stochastic extinction.

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:52.514
So we still have
the same 0.01 here.

00:29:52.514 --> 00:29:54.430
But now we have to think
about the probability

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:56.980
that A doesn't survive.

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:00.270
And that's going to
change now, right?

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:03.660
Oh, I should be-- OK.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.452
Yeah, OK.

00:30:05.452 --> 00:30:06.660
I forgot that we had 10 here.

00:30:10.522 --> 00:30:12.730
We could calculate what it
is, and actually, maybe we

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:13.780
should have.

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:16.460
Well, let's calculate that.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:21.440
All right, so this
is x1 for B. We still

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:24.560
have 1.01 to the
mill-- so we can still

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.029
ignore this bottom part.

00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:28.570
But what it's going
to be is, oh, no,

00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:31.380
but there's this x10 of B,
where you have 10 individuals.

00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:38.295
So this is 1 minus
1.01 to the 10th power.

00:30:38.295 --> 00:30:40.760
AUDIENCE: But we have
clonal interference here.

00:30:42.754 --> 00:30:44.920
PROFESSOR: Right now what
we're trying to understand

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:51.550
is if only we had B-- this
is the probability that we're

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:53.720
trying to calculate
this part of it.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:55.770
So if we ignore A, what's
the probably that B

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:57.061
survives stochastic extinction?

00:31:01.828 --> 00:31:04.840
Oh, this is fine.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.460
So it's a modest change.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:14.110
Because this is
going to be 1 minus.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:27.180
So this thing is around 1.1,
because 1 plus x to the n

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:31.915
is around 1 plus nx for
nx much less than 1.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:48.110
So this is 1.1.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.210
OK, so right.

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:55.300
So this is around 0.1.

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:59.850
So indeed, I'd forgotten
that there was 10.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:04.010
So given that we have 10 of
these B individuals starting,

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:06.210
they may survive.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.870
Ignoring A right now, just
on their own dynamics,

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:14.420
they may survive, or they may
drift down to 0 and go extinct.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.690
And indeed, even starting
with 10 individuals--

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.330
10 B individuals-- you
actually still expect them

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:20.722
to go extinct.

00:32:20.722 --> 00:32:22.260
And this, actually,
calculation is

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.392
very relevant for what
we're about to think about,

00:32:24.392 --> 00:32:25.850
which is this
question of what does

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.855
it mean to be established
in a population.

00:32:27.855 --> 00:32:32.050
And already you can kind of
see what it's going to mean.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:33.930
How big do you need to
get in the population

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.295
before you're likely to survive?

00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.200
AUDIENCE: 1/s.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.161
PROFESSOR: 1/s.

00:32:40.161 --> 00:32:41.536
Because you can
basically see how

00:32:41.536 --> 00:32:43.452
this is going to work
out in this calculation,

00:32:43.452 --> 00:32:47.090
that the number you have
to get to to be established

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:49.854
is around 1/s.

00:32:49.854 --> 00:32:52.270
So in this case, you have to
get to around 100 individuals

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:55.715
before you are going to be more
likely than not to survive.

00:32:59.657 --> 00:33:01.490
Let's see if we can
figure out this problem.

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:04.130
All right, so we had
0.1 was the probability

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:06.010
that B would survive
stochastic extinction.

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:07.504
But then in order
for B to fix, it

00:33:07.504 --> 00:33:09.420
has to not only survive
stochastic extinction,

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.110
but also A has to not survive.

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.140
And we can figure out what
that is going to be here.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:21.430
This is that term.

00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:24.870
And then we need another one.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:28.820
So this is x of 10 of
A. And this is, again,

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:33.370
going to be 1 minus
1/2 to the 10th power.

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:35.842
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:35.842 --> 00:33:36.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.050
So it's always good to
memorize a few of these things.

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:45.740
2 to the 10 is
approximately 1,000.

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:47.680
But we want not this.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:49.590
So we're going to
subtract this 1 away.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.320
So we're going to get
10 to the minus 3.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:56.790
Do you guys see
how that-- right?

00:33:56.790 --> 00:34:00.013
So given that we start
with 10 individuals of A

00:34:00.013 --> 00:34:02.552
with a relative fitness
2, then there's only a 1

00:34:02.552 --> 00:34:04.950
in 1,000 chance that
those A individuals

00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:06.300
are going to go extinct.

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.040
So the probability that B is
going to fix in this situation

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.750
is rather close to
10 to the minus 4.

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:23.460
So it's somewhere
in between there.

00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:31.299
Are there any questions
about how that came about?

00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:36.920
I feel like there's a fair
amount of unhappiness.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.260
So it could be
the logic of this,

00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:56.510
or it could be the calculation
of one of the two terms

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.210
or it could be something else.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.710
Yes?

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:00.376
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:35:00.376 --> 00:35:03.686
Where did you get
x10 B, the probably

00:35:03.686 --> 00:35:07.336
of x of B surviving again?

00:35:07.336 --> 00:35:09.460
PROFESSOR: You want to know
this term or that term?

00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:10.501
AUDIENCE: The first term.

00:35:10.501 --> 00:35:12.120
PROFESSOR: Right,
the first term.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.190
So the first term
is just asking,

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:18.240
if there were no A, what would
be the probability that B would

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.490
survive stochastic extinction?

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:23.010
That's the same as the
probability that it would fix,

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:25.060
because it's a
beneficial mutation,

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:26.846
and if B is the
only thing, right?

00:35:26.846 --> 00:35:27.846
So we use this equation.

00:35:27.846 --> 00:35:29.862
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:35:29.862 --> 00:35:31.320
PROFESSOR: So we
use this equation,

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.140
except that this
thing just goes to 1,

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.470
so we're just left with this.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.714
But this equation is
assuming that there's

00:35:36.714 --> 00:35:38.172
just one of the
mutant individuals.

00:35:38.172 --> 00:35:44.050
Otherwise if you say x sub
i, then it's r to the i here.

00:35:50.474 --> 00:35:52.640
So that was the equation
that was derived in chapter

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:54.275
six of Evolutionary Dynamics.

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.670
But I think that that's not
the only thing that people are

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:10.511
unhappy about, so please-- no?

00:36:10.511 --> 00:36:11.010
Yes.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:12.551
AUDIENCE: A question
on why don't you

00:36:12.551 --> 00:36:14.398
need to take into
account B doesn't

00:36:14.398 --> 00:36:16.818
survive-- that probability
that B doesn't survive?

00:36:16.818 --> 00:36:19.234
For that first question that's
not on the board right now,

00:36:19.234 --> 00:36:23.084
I guess, for the nearly
neutral [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:23.084 --> 00:36:25.500
PROFESSOR: OK, so this was the
very first one that we did?

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.574
OK.

00:36:26.574 --> 00:36:27.740
Right, so you want to know--

00:36:30.532 --> 00:36:32.740
AUDIENCE: Why don't you need
to take into account the

00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:33.880
probably that B doesn't survive?

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.588
PROFESSOR: All right,
so in this problem,

00:36:35.588 --> 00:36:39.700
it's just that they all behave
as if they were just neutral.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:42.390
So the probability of each of
these 10 individuals fixing

00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:46.520
in the population is
the same, essentially.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:51.460
So they each have a 1 in 10
probability of surviving.

00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:53.770
And in this case, I
would say that if things

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.040
are nearly neutral,
you don't talk

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.200
about this idea of surviving
stochastic extinction,

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.730
because you can't get
big enough to the point

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.644
where you are really
guaranteed to survive

00:37:06.644 --> 00:37:07.560
stochastic extinction.

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.610
Because even if you've gone to
occupy 75% of the population,

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.610
what's your probability
of fixing at that stage?

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.310
If you're nearly neutral
and you get up to 75%,

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:21.690
you have a 75% chance of fixing.

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:27.170
In the case in the
neutral mutations,

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.750
there's no analogous
idea of what

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.510
it means to be established,
because you could always

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.850
just go back and go extinct
with finite probability.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.415
This question?

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:50.300
Well, it's looking more
and more likely to show up

00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:53.980
on the midterm in two weeks.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:58.972
So now is your opportunity
to ask a question about it.

00:37:58.972 --> 00:38:02.870
AUDIENCE: Can you talk
about and establish

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:03.980
how you got [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:04.650
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:07.320
OK, this is a good question.

00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:12.230
So when we talk about a mutation
becoming established, that's

00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:18.310
asking-- of course, we know
that even a rather beneficial

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:19.810
mutation, say
something that confers

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:24.520
advantage of a few percent,
will probably go extinct.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.150
However, if it gets up to
be a large enough fraction

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:31.745
or a number of the
population, then the dynamics

00:38:31.745 --> 00:38:34.120
are going to be well described
by a differential equation

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.810
where it won't go extinct.

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.990
So this is established mutation.

00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:42.060
And this, again, we
really talk about only

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:45.392
for beneficial mutations,
because other mutations

00:38:45.392 --> 00:38:46.600
can't really get established.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.210
They could still
stochastically fix.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.775
But it's still stochastic
up to the very end.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.605
And so the question is, at
what number in the population

00:38:58.605 --> 00:39:01.750
do you had to get before you
are expected to take over

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:06.050
the population, assuming that
other new mutants don't arise.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:15.260
That corresponds
to asking, OK, this

00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.718
is the probability
of fixation when

00:39:16.718 --> 00:39:21.330
you have i individuals
in the population.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.060
And this is what we saw before.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.280
This is permutation
with relative fitness r.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.940
You have i individuals in the
population, total population

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:34.700
size n.

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:42.300
And this becoming
established means that xi

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.720
is approximately equal to 1.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.480
Now, in these
situations, r to the n

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.199
is, again, very, very large.

00:39:55.199 --> 00:39:56.365
So this thing we can ignore.

00:39:56.365 --> 00:39:58.840
So this is really the same
thing as asking that 1 minus.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:05.530
And this never gets to
be exactly equal to 1.

00:40:05.530 --> 00:40:07.360
But what now we're
really asking is

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.770
that this thing is close to 1.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:13.470
And this equivalent
is saying that--

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:17.120
what do we want to say--
that 1 over r to the i

00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.390
is much less than 1.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:28.930
And well, that means that r to
the i is much greater than 1.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.050
So this is really saying
that what you want

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:43.740
is i times s to be
much greater than 1.

00:40:51.432 --> 00:40:54.980
So n established,
which is, in this case,

00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.575
it's the i such
that this is true.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:02.850
It has to be much
greater than 1 over s.

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:17.870
And indeed, I think that when
i is equal to 1 over s, then

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.500
I think the probability
of extinction is 1 over e,

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.950
if you do the math.

00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:27.050
So that means that this is kind
of the crossing over point,

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.320
where you're more likely
than not to survive.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.690
And just to be concrete,
for many of the mutations

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:39.440
we're talking about and that
you read about in Roy's paper,

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.170
s was a few percent.

00:41:42.170 --> 00:41:44.450
So this is saying that the
population is established

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:47.860
when the number of these
mutants gets up to above 30

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.750
or a few times 30, so
maybe 100 individuals

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.220
means that it's unlikely to
go extinct stochastically.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:02.690
So really, it's once you
get to this n established,

00:42:02.690 --> 00:42:04.610
then the population
will grow exponentially

00:42:04.610 --> 00:42:05.390
in the population.

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:07.347
And it's going to
spread exponentially

00:42:07.347 --> 00:42:09.805
with an advantage s relative
to the rest of the population.

00:42:13.309 --> 00:42:15.850
So this discussion is actually
very useful for the next thing

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:16.766
we want to talk about.

00:42:16.766 --> 00:42:18.890
But are there any question
about how we got this?

00:42:22.741 --> 00:42:24.866
AUDIENCE: You said the
probability of going extinct

00:42:24.866 --> 00:42:26.870
is 1 over e.

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:28.230
PROFESSOR: Right

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:30.370
AUDIENCE: So xi is
approximately equal to 1.

00:42:32.482 --> 00:42:33.190
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:38.064
So this is the probably
of going extinct?

00:42:38.064 --> 00:42:39.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.910
PROFESSOR: So the probability
of going extinct here,

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:47.583
if you have i individuals,
is 1 over this guy.

00:42:47.583 --> 00:42:52.330
So it's 1 over 1
plus s to the i.

00:42:52.330 --> 00:43:02.930
And then if i times s
is 1 but s is small--

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:07.030
this is one of those
definitions of e to the x

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:09.470
that, I don't know, do
you guys remember this?

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:15.390
It's like, oh my goodness,
e to the x is the limit.

00:43:22.449 --> 00:43:26.390
No, no, x is up there.

00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:28.810
Boy, you guys are taxing me.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.210
All right.

00:43:30.210 --> 00:43:34.010
This is x over n to the n.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:36.900
And this limit is
n goes to infinity.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.440
Is this?

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.237
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:43:38.237 --> 00:43:39.195
PROFESSOR: Do we agree?

00:43:39.195 --> 00:43:39.695
OK.

00:43:42.350 --> 00:43:43.488
This makes sense, right?

00:43:47.264 --> 00:43:48.930
So this is just the
equivalent of saying

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:52.110
that if i times s equal
to 1 but s is small,

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:54.110
then this thing is around e.

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:00.610
If you're confused, I
don't want to get into this

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.060
too much, because it's
not quite central to what

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:02.640
we're talking about.

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.640
But come up and talk
to me after the class,

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.800
and we'll derive this together.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:15.500
So the idea is that when you've
reached a population size of 1

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.297
over s, then you have a 1 over
e probability of going extinct.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.510
So e pops up at all
sorts of weird locations.

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:27.800
This is why you hear about it.

00:44:33.084 --> 00:44:34.500
So what I want to
do now is I want

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.330
to discuss this idea of clonal
interference a little bit more,

00:44:38.330 --> 00:44:41.850
in particular ask, in
what situation will

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:44.270
we have clonal interference?

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:47.010
Or equivalently, when can we
ignore clonal interference?

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.290
Can somebody say
in words when we're

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.870
going to be able to ignore the
effect of clonal interference?

00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:58.693
Yes.

00:44:58.693 --> 00:45:02.477
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] so large
that there's a very limited

00:45:02.477 --> 00:45:04.954
match that goes to--

00:45:04.954 --> 00:45:06.370
PROFESSOR: OK, I
think we're going

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.750
to have to be careful here.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.510
Because you're saying, oh
well, if the population

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:13.580
is large enough,
then you're saying,

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.370
oh, the mutations
won't interact, right?

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.140
AUDIENCE: Not in the beginning.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:17.250
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:18.791
They don't interact
at the beginning.

00:45:18.791 --> 00:45:21.220
I think that statement
I'm very happy with.

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.840
But the problem is that
if they both survive

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:27.170
stochastic extinction
and they start spreading,

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:32.020
then they do start to interact
in this large population.

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.962
AUDIENCE: Didn't you
just say that once they

00:45:33.962 --> 00:45:37.892
survive stochastic extinction,
they pretty much behave like--

00:45:37.892 --> 00:45:39.600
PROFESSOR: They behave
deterministically.

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.530
But the thing is that if you
have two sub-populations that

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:44.520
are exponentially
growing-- and there

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.390
are these very nice diagrams
that I guess in Roy's paper

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:48.530
they don't show.

00:45:48.530 --> 00:45:56.060
Which is if you look at somehow
the population kind of changing

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:02.970
as a function of time, you can
think about, OK, well, this

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.630
is, let's say, constant
population size.

00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:09.610
And it starts out all
being a particular type.

00:46:09.610 --> 00:46:12.480
We'll say there's
some population of A.

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.094
But now a new mutation
arises and survives

00:46:15.094 --> 00:46:16.010
stochastic extinction.

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.196
It starts spreading
in the population.

00:46:18.196 --> 00:46:22.840
All right, this may
be mutant B. But then

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:28.110
if another mutant appears over
here that's even more fit,

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:32.160
then it can actually
spread faster.

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:39.520
And indeed, it can cause the
B lineage to get out competed.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:45.950
So we start out with population
A. Mutant B is more fit than A.

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:47.660
It's spreading exponentially.

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:51.230
But some time later
mutation C appears.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.810
Now this C lineage
is more fit than B,

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:56.390
so it's able to
spread exponentially.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:47:02.900
And indeed, it out competes
B. So this is exactly what

00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:05.220
we mean by clonal interference.

00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:09.500
These two lineages are
interfering with each other.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:12.550
So this is, indeed,
clonal interference.

00:47:12.550 --> 00:47:14.305
And there have been
these drawings out.

00:47:14.305 --> 00:47:16.680
For every 20 years, people
have been thinking about this.

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:19.540
Like Lenski wrote some classic
papers thinking about this.

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.962
Recently, Michael
Desai at Harvard

00:47:22.962 --> 00:47:24.420
has done some really
beautiful work

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:27.200
where he takes these
evolving yeast populations.

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:30.685
He does high
resolution-- resolution

00:47:30.685 --> 00:47:33.230
in both senses,
temporal as well as

00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:36.060
kind of deep sequencing in the
population-- where he could

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.060
actually directly see these
lineages spreading and then

00:47:40.060 --> 00:47:41.030
being out-competed.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:43.737
And he sees multiple
mutations spreading

00:47:43.737 --> 00:47:45.570
through the population
together because they

00:47:45.570 --> 00:47:46.778
were attached on some genome.

00:47:46.778 --> 00:47:50.670
It's a very nice paper.

00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:53.200
I almost had you guys
read it, so it's maybe

00:47:53.200 --> 00:48:02.637
Nature in 2012, '13.

00:48:02.637 --> 00:48:04.480
I don't know, possibly '12.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.040
So this is the idea of
clonal interference.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:13.404
So it's after the initial
stochastic dynamics

00:48:13.404 --> 00:48:14.070
have played out.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:14.914
Yes.

00:48:14.914 --> 00:48:18.232
AUDIENCE: Is the [? spectre ?]
[INAUDIBLE] you call that

00:48:18.232 --> 00:48:20.510
[? clonal ?] [? interference? ?]

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:23.010
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that is a
result of clonal interference,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:27.990
because it's saying that that
half arises because B, maybe,

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.900
if it did survive, it may
still get out-competed by A.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.083
So that's clonal interference.

00:48:33.083 --> 00:48:35.166
AUDIENCE: Did you say the
populations of mutations

00:48:35.166 --> 00:48:36.532
weren't [? correct? ?]

00:48:36.532 --> 00:48:37.240
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.390
So the idea is that they
don't interact initially.

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.000
Because when the mutations
are present at a very low

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.660
frequency, then they're
really interacting

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:49.010
with the bulk, the rest of the
population, 10 to the 6 there.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:50.970
However, if they survive
stochastic extinction

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:53.020
and they start spreading
in the population,

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:56.998
then there's the possibility
of clonal interference.

00:48:56.998 --> 00:49:00.097
AUDIENCE: But wouldn't that
change that [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:00.097 --> 00:49:00.680
PROFESSOR: No.

00:49:00.680 --> 00:49:04.800
I think that's why
it's at the half.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:07.150
Because this factor of a
half is really just saying

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:10.250
that even if B survives
stochastic extinction,

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:12.270
it only has a 50-50
shot of actually being

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:15.037
able to take over, because
there's a 50% chance

00:49:15.037 --> 00:49:16.870
it's going to experience
clonal interference

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:18.994
with this A lineage that's
going to out-compete it.

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:30.971
Maybe if you're unhappy
about that statement,

00:49:30.971 --> 00:49:31.845
harass me afterwards.

00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:39.060
So from this
discussion, though, how

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.642
can we think about
the importance

00:49:40.642 --> 00:49:41.600
of clonal interference?

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:45.670
In particular, there are
going to be two time scales.

00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:47.149
And the question
of whether there's

00:49:47.149 --> 00:49:48.940
going to be significant
clonal interference

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:53.070
is related to which of
these time scales is larger.

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:54.975
So what might the
time scales be?

00:50:12.507 --> 00:50:13.965
Or at least one of
the time scales?

00:50:18.676 --> 00:50:20.217
AUDIENCE: I guess
one should probably

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:21.952
be the time to be established.

00:50:21.952 --> 00:50:22.660
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.270
To be established.

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:26.914
AUDIENCE: To reach the
[INAUDIBLE] [? establish. ?]

00:50:26.914 --> 00:50:27.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:33.405 --> 00:50:37.210
So the actual time that it takes
from when a mutation appears

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:42.600
to when it becomes established--
I mean, there is a time there.

00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:45.540
But it ends up not being
the relevant thing,

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.130
because that's the regime
where they're not actually

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:50.550
interacting, that the
mutant lineages are not

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:52.030
interacting anyways.

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:53.950
So there's a sense
that it doesn't quite

00:50:53.950 --> 00:50:58.206
matter how long that takes,
at least to first order.

00:50:58.206 --> 00:51:03.036
AUDIENCE: How much time did it
take to reach some population

00:51:03.036 --> 00:51:06.132
size [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:06.132 --> 00:51:06.840
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:07.680
OK, yeah.

00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.380
So one of them is
going to be that it's

00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:16.200
the time to go from
established to fixation.

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.992
So it's actually the
next time scale there.

00:51:17.992 --> 00:51:19.699
And actually, the time
to get established

00:51:19.699 --> 00:51:20.770
is actually rather short.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.740
So a mutation appears, and most
of the time it goes extinct.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:27.531
But the ones that don't
go extinct actually

00:51:27.531 --> 00:51:29.570
get established rather
quickly, because that's

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:33.190
a biased sampling
over the trajectories.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.360
But there is a rather
significant time

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:37.192
that it takes for
the lineage to go

00:51:37.192 --> 00:51:38.900
from being established
to actually fixing

00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:39.710
in the population.

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:42.300
So this is kind of how long
it takes for a mutation

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.220
to take over a population.

00:51:45.220 --> 00:51:47.500
We might call this the
time to spread or so.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.920
And it turns out
that that time--

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.710
what is it going to depend on?

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:56.489
AUDIENCE: s.

00:51:56.489 --> 00:51:58.030
PROFESSOR: It's
going to depend on s.

00:51:58.030 --> 00:52:04.610
So as s goes up,
then this goes down.

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:05.410
All right, perfect.

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:09.124
All right, let's just
go put a 1 over s there.

00:52:09.124 --> 00:52:11.290
And this is because it's
going to grow exponentially

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:13.190
in the population.

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:15.560
And then how else is
it going to depend on?

00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:16.860
AUDIENCE: n.

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:18.100
PROFESSOR: n, right.

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:22.980
And indeed, this is going
to be the log of n times s.

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:25.460
It's really n over
n established.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.280
Because the idea is that you
start out at n established.

00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:30.920
You grow exponentially with
rate s until you kind of take

00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.780
over the population, size n.

00:52:36.215 --> 00:52:41.846
And this s appears because
it's 1 over n established.

00:52:41.846 --> 00:52:44.230
Because this in the log
is really the population

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:45.480
size divided by n established.

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:50.470
So this is one time scale.

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.810
Do you guys understand why
it should be like this?

00:52:57.060 --> 00:52:57.560
Right.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.768
And what's the other time
scale that's relevant here?

00:52:59.768 --> 00:53:03.530
AUDIENCE: How fast
mutations occur.

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:06.536
PROFESSOR: How fast
mutations-- yes.

00:53:06.536 --> 00:53:08.744
AUDIENCE: How long you have
to wait from one mutation

00:53:08.744 --> 00:53:09.950
to the next mutation.

00:53:09.950 --> 00:53:10.770
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:14.370
So this is how long you have
to wait for one mutation.

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:20.290
So this is T, what we
might call T mutation.

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:21.850
Now it's a little
bit subtle to think

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:25.440
about what this should be.

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.940
But it should say
something about the time

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:32.216
it takes for mutations to
appear in the population.

00:53:32.216 --> 00:53:36.430
So let's go ahead and just
guess what this might be.

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:38.720
T mutation should
be equal to what?

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.380
All right, so it could be--

00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:46.716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:52.754 --> 00:53:53.420
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:56.650
So I guess I'm trying to get you
to think about what this should

00:53:56.650 --> 00:53:59.860
mean to be relevant for
determining the time

00:53:59.860 --> 00:54:02.022
scales of whether clonal
interference is important.

00:54:02.022 --> 00:54:04.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:08.820
PROFESSOR: Mu is the
probability per generation

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:13.020
of having a beneficial
mutation of magnitude s.

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:18.764
Mu is kind of the mutation rate.

00:54:18.764 --> 00:54:20.442
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:20.442 --> 00:54:21.150
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:54:21.150 --> 00:54:23.839
But we'll just
assume that there's

00:54:23.839 --> 00:54:25.380
only one kind of
beneficial mutation,

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.550
and every beneficial
mutation has magnitude s,

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:30.990
for simplicity.

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:32.960
So it's mutation rate.

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:35.430
It's a beneficial mutation
rate per generation

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:36.965
of leading to mutation s.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:46.720
And you can just also say,
if you have no idea what

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.160
I'm talking about, it's fine.

00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:52.890
But it's worth spending a
little bit of time thinking

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:54.880
about what should
be the relevant time

00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.466
scale to compare to this.

00:54:57.466 --> 00:54:57.965
Yes?

00:54:57.965 --> 00:55:00.212
AUDIENCE: So Mu is per
organism [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:03.156 --> 00:55:04.156
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:18.970
And it's OK if you
find this confusing,

00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:20.200
because this is subtle.

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:22.380
But if you think about
it for 30 seconds, then

00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:27.220
maybe you'll be fertile ground
for the discussion to follow.

00:55:47.392 --> 00:55:49.920
All right, let's go ahead and
vote and see where we are.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.220
Ready, three, two, one.

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.260
All right.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.850
This is very nice.

00:55:59.850 --> 00:56:05.748
Almost everybody is saying C.
Although it really should be D.

00:56:05.748 --> 00:56:06.664
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.594
So 1 over s is units of time,
and 1 over mu is [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:19.110
PROFESSOR: OK, that's an
interesting statement.

00:56:19.110 --> 00:56:21.730
I mean, I guess this
is a relative fitness.

00:56:21.730 --> 00:56:22.690
AUDIENCE: So s is mu.

00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:25.070
AUDIENCE: But right
there, you have s units

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:29.000
of time, 1/s units of time.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.625
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the problem of this

00:56:30.625 --> 00:56:33.525
is this is all in units
of generation time.

00:56:33.525 --> 00:56:34.900
Because this is
really telling us

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.233
about the number of generations.

00:56:39.970 --> 00:56:45.379
So what is going on?

00:56:45.379 --> 00:56:47.420
Because 1 over mu n should
also be a time, right?

00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.906
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.380
Yeah, I'm not sure
if-- yeah, I mean,

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.754
since this is all
in generations,

00:57:03.754 --> 00:57:11.550
I'm not sure if we even have
to-- yeah, I think it's OK.

00:57:11.550 --> 00:57:13.494
AUDIENCE: n times s
has to be [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:16.410 --> 00:57:18.880
PROFESSOR: I like
that statement.

00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.100
But then he, I mean--

00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.940
AUDIENCE: Well, then
you have 1 over mu.

00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:22.939
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I know.

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:25.845
But then, this should
have units of time.

00:57:25.845 --> 00:57:29.520
I agree with your statement, but
I also sort of agree with his,

00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:30.520
the 1 over s here.

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:31.190
You know that's the problem.

00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:32.130
AUDIENCE: Everything
is basically unitless.

00:57:32.130 --> 00:57:33.630
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but I
think that it's really

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:35.463
because everything's
in units of generation.

00:57:35.463 --> 00:57:37.300
So really, it's all
unitless, except for mu.

00:57:37.300 --> 00:57:38.166
Yeah.

00:57:38.166 --> 00:57:39.541
AUDIENCE: What I
don't understand

00:57:39.541 --> 00:57:44.462
is why how beneficial
the mutation is

00:57:44.462 --> 00:57:46.430
should play into how--

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:47.860
PROFESSOR: No, I agree.

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:49.900
This is subtle.

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:51.460
So let's imagine this is time.

00:57:55.700 --> 00:58:01.330
Now, 1 over mu n is
telling us how much time

00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:03.660
there is between the
initial appearance

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:06.994
of these beneficial mutants.

00:58:06.994 --> 00:58:08.535
So here we get a
beneficial mutation.

00:58:10.484 --> 00:58:12.150
But what do you think
is going to happen

00:58:12.150 --> 00:58:14.754
to that beneficial mutation?

00:58:14.754 --> 00:58:15.670
Yeah, that guy's dead.

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:18.709
It comes up.

00:58:18.709 --> 00:58:21.250
How long do we have to wait for
the next beneficial mutation?

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:22.280
AUDIENCE: 1 over mu n.

00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.238
PROFESSOR: 1 over mu n.

00:58:23.238 --> 00:58:24.824
Is it going to be exactly that?

00:58:24.824 --> 00:58:26.240
Is going to be
peaked around that?

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.790
All right, verbal
answer, what is

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:34.070
going to be the
probability distribution

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:38.490
between successive appearances
of this beneficial mutation?

00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:40.996
Ready, three, two, one.

00:58:40.996 --> 00:58:41.912
AUDIENCE: Exponential.

00:58:41.912 --> 00:58:44.130
PROFESSOR: It's
exponentially distributed.

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:46.010
So there might be another one
that's coming through here.

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:47.090
What do you think is going
to happen to that guy?

00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:47.842
AUDIENCE: Probably dead.

00:58:47.842 --> 00:58:48.950
PROFESSOR: Oh, he's dead.

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:50.330
OK.

00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:51.880
Another one.

00:58:51.880 --> 00:58:54.900
So these guys are appearing.

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:57.360
But if the magnitude
of s is, say,

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.770
0.02, that means we have to
wait for 50 of these things

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:01.890
to appear before we
expect that one of them

00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:05.250
is actually going
to get established.

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:07.460
And established means
it gets up to 1 over s.

00:59:12.342 --> 00:59:13.800
So this guy, once
he's established,

00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:17.560
he's going to grow
exponentially in the population.

00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:24.760
But the idea is that the time
scale here of 1 over mu n

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.810
is the time between
successive appearances

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:36.980
of this beneficial mutation,
whereas as 1 over mu ns

00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.030
is the time scale between
successive establishments

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:42.380
of these beneficial mutations.

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:43.921
And it's only if
they get established

00:59:43.921 --> 00:59:47.060
that they're relevant.

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:52.740
So that's why the t mutation
established is 1 over mu ns.

00:59:56.320 --> 01:00:02.710
Now, no clonal interference
means that one of these

01:00:02.710 --> 01:00:04.150
is larger than the other one.

01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:10.340
So no clonal
interference means is it,

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:13.470
A, this guy's larger,
or B, this guy's larger?

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:18.431
So larger, question mark.

01:00:18.431 --> 01:00:18.930
This one?

01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:19.730
That one?

01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:21.521
All right, think about
this for 15 seconds,

01:00:21.521 --> 01:00:24.160
just to make sure that
we're-- make sure.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.210
We're asking, if there's
no clonal interference,

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:28.751
it means that one of these is
much larger than the other one.

01:00:28.751 --> 01:00:29.350
Which one?

01:00:29.350 --> 01:00:34.140
Ready, three, two, one.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:39.370
It means that this thing is
much larger than this one.

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:46.820
So this thing has to be much
larger than t establish to fix.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:53.030
Because if it's the
case this time scale

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.460
is very large compared to
this time scale of spreading,

01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:58.280
then the mutations don't
ever clonal interfere.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.500
I think it's very important
that you can reconstruct

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.230
this whole argument
because it has

01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:10.690
all the ingredients of
the dynamics in terms

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:14.235
of stochastic, and
then deterministic.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:20.290
If you find this stuff
confusing, please

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:22.940
go through it with a friend
or come to me after class.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:28.570
So what we went to do
for the last 20 minutes

01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:32.680
is, then, talk
about Roy's paper.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.796
And I think that this paper
is interesting and subtle.

01:01:37.796 --> 01:01:39.670
It's a little bit hard
to tell how much of it

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:45.020
is an experimental kind of
straight up demonstration

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:47.350
or how much of it is that
it's just a way of getting

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:49.179
you to think new thoughts.

01:01:49.179 --> 01:01:51.470
It certainly is a way to get
you to think new thoughts.

01:01:51.470 --> 01:01:54.990
At least I felt that it
had that effect on me,

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:57.510
and that after
reading it, I just

01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:59.620
got very excited
about all the dynamics

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:03.670
that were at play
here, and how out

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:05.660
of the complexity of
this clonal interference

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.270
process, maybe, in
some cases, there

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:10.060
might be some even simpler
phenomenological type

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.164
description of
what was going on.

01:02:12.164 --> 01:02:14.580
But I think that what is very
interesting about that paper

01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.210
is this idea that what they
really wanted to measure

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:19.140
was this probability
distribution

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:22.200
of beneficial mutations.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:25.874
So what we mean by that is that
different beneficial mutations

01:02:25.874 --> 01:02:27.040
will have different effects.

01:02:36.790 --> 01:02:40.350
And in particular, you could
imagine a thought experiment

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:43.480
where you take an E. coli cell.

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:49.770
How big is the E.
coli genome roughly?

01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:52.685
And just like it's always good
to have guideposts for how long

01:02:52.685 --> 01:02:54.935
ago things happened, it's
also good to have guideposts

01:02:54.935 --> 01:02:56.860
for things like it's
just good to have

01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:00.590
a few genome sizes memorized.

01:03:00.590 --> 01:03:02.300
Now does anybody know
the E. coli genome?

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.474
AUDIENCE: 2,000 base pairs.

01:03:04.474 --> 01:03:05.640
PROFESSOR: 2,000 base pairs?

01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.485
AUDIENCE: 2,000 [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:07.485 --> 01:03:10.330
PROFESSOR: No, I just want to
make sure that we're-- yeah.

01:03:10.330 --> 01:03:13.800
Yeah, it's a bit more than that.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.000
It's a few million base
pairs, three or four,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.100
depending on the strain.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:21.190
But you can imagine a thought
experiment where you go in,

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:26.490
and at every base pair you
make the three possible point

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.120
mutations.

01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.700
So then you can imagine having
10 million different strains

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:35.020
that are each
different at one site.

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:39.310
And then what we can do is we
can plot the rate of population

01:03:39.310 --> 01:03:41.510
growth in some environment.

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:43.810
So this is gamma.

01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:51.040
It's the 1 over n dn/dt,
basically division, right?

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:59.110
Normalized by the
wild type division.

01:03:59.110 --> 01:04:04.070
I'm sorry, that's
supposed to be down there.

01:04:04.070 --> 01:04:08.970
So this is gamma over
gamma of wild type.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:15.510
And this could be E. coli
in LB or minimal media or at

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.040
30 [? ci ?].

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:19.260
You pick some
reasonable environment.

01:04:19.260 --> 01:04:21.440
Question is, if you draw
the histogram of what

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.265
this thing should look
like, what should it be?

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:32.960
Now what I'm going to ask
you to do is, in 30 seconds,

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.490
draw something on
your sheet of paper.

01:04:38.014 --> 01:04:39.430
This is supposed
to be a frequency

01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:45.107
or histogram over those 10
million point mutations.

01:04:45.107 --> 01:04:46.940
So we haven't actually
done this experiment.

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:54.160
But I think we have
made all possible gene

01:04:54.160 --> 01:05:01.910
knockouts in E. coli, so
removing each of the genes.

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:03.540
And we've done that in E. coli.

01:05:03.540 --> 01:05:04.822
We've done it in yeast.

01:05:04.822 --> 01:05:07.280
And indeed, in yeast, they're
actually making and measuring

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:11.270
the division rate for
all pairwise knockouts.

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:14.600
So they're some fraction
of the way through.

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.315
They published their first
10 million measurements

01:05:17.315 --> 01:05:19.690
for the division rate of the
pairwise knockouts in yeast.

01:05:19.690 --> 01:05:21.350
This is Charlie
Boone at Toronto.

01:05:21.350 --> 01:05:23.630
It's an amazing data set.

01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:25.000
Sorry, this is a simpler one.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.850
So this is just if we make
a histogram of the growth

01:05:27.850 --> 01:05:33.530
rate of E. coli, all 10
million possible point

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:35.279
mutations in E.
coli, what do you

01:05:35.279 --> 01:05:36.528
think it's going to look like?

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:49.380
And I'm going to come by, and if
I don't see distribution drawn

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:53.300
on your sheet of
paper, then you'll

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:56.825
get to draw it up here on
the board for all of us.

01:06:03.529 --> 01:06:06.847
AUDIENCE: It's totally
a distribution.

01:06:06.847 --> 01:06:07.430
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:06:14.754 --> 01:06:15.740
All right.

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:20.008
AUDIENCE: He was coming.

01:06:20.008 --> 01:06:21.415
He was coming to me.

01:06:21.415 --> 01:06:22.290
PROFESSOR: All right.

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:24.248
And what I find interesting
about this exercise

01:06:24.248 --> 01:06:26.440
is that you get all
possible distributions.

01:06:30.276 --> 01:06:34.530
No, but it's funny, because it's
like a super basic question.

01:06:34.530 --> 01:06:38.800
And somehow we don't necessarily
think about it, or whatnot.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.250
Could somebody
throw out what they

01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:41.976
think maybe should be going on?

01:06:41.976 --> 01:06:42.928
Yeah.

01:06:42.928 --> 01:06:46.736
AUDIENCE: So I'm expecting
a large fraction to get 0.

01:06:52.410 --> 01:06:56.030
PROFESSOR: So it could
be that they're all here.

01:06:56.030 --> 01:06:59.036
AUDIENCE: You know, most will
start-- not most, but large

01:06:59.036 --> 01:07:01.007
fractions [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:01.007 --> 01:07:03.590
PROFESSOR: So it could be that
a large fraction of these point

01:07:03.590 --> 01:07:07.280
mutations, and the
cell is just dead.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:09.540
So this is what you call a
pessimistic view of nature

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:11.740
or of life.

01:07:11.740 --> 01:07:14.970
And he has trouble crossing the
street because he's never sure.

01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:16.366
What do you think?

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:21.159
AUDIENCE: I actually think that
there's a much larger fraction

01:07:21.159 --> 01:07:22.992
where it's exactly the
same, because they've

01:07:22.992 --> 01:07:25.478
got a lot of point mutations
that are just substitutions.

01:07:25.478 --> 01:07:26.311
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

01:07:26.311 --> 01:07:28.970
So lots of them, maybe.

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:31.630
So these are the two
polar views of the world,

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:35.225
that nothing matters,
or you're all dead.

01:07:37.737 --> 01:07:39.320
AUDIENCE: I think
it can reconcile it.

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:41.240
I think you can say--

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:45.040
PROFESSOR: OK, well, now I
think you're being too-- OK,

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:46.510
how are we going
to reconcile them?

01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:48.551
AUDIENCE: So we know that
there's the [? third ?]

01:07:48.551 --> 01:07:49.644
[? bubble, ?] right?

01:07:49.644 --> 01:07:50.310
PROFESSOR: Sure.

01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:53.572
AUDIENCE: And so there's
probably at least 1/3

01:07:53.572 --> 01:07:57.486
somewhere it just doesn't
matter at all, where

01:07:57.486 --> 01:07:59.014
you get the same code.

01:07:59.014 --> 01:08:00.930
PROFESSOR: Although there
are cases, actually,

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:02.660
where even silent
mutations end up changing

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:03.951
protein at an expression level.

01:08:03.951 --> 01:08:07.056
All right, but I don't
know if this reconciles

01:08:07.056 --> 01:08:08.180
the two views of the world.

01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:18.135
So some people have drawn
things that look like this.

01:08:18.135 --> 01:08:21.090
Some people will draw it,
and things look like this.

01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:22.056
Yeah.

01:08:22.056 --> 01:08:23.514
And we have a
uniform distribution.

01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:30.069
If you're going to make a null
model, I mean, I don't know.

01:08:30.069 --> 01:08:32.630
So I would say that we
have enough information

01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:35.290
to say something about what
this thing should look like.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:43.695
So first of all, some fraction
of genes are indeed essential.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:53.430
For 10% or 20% of the genes,
you remove it, the cell is dead.

01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:56.340
That doesn't mean that 10%
to 20% of point mutations

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.420
will lead to a lethal
phenotype, but it

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:05.359
means that if you do inactivate
or knock out that gene,

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:06.979
then it will be lethal.

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:12.547
So that means that there are
indeed some set of these point

01:09:12.547 --> 01:09:14.130
mutations that are
going to be lethal,

01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:17.720
but it's going to be small.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.710
And I don't know what
the actual number

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:29.040
would be, but maybe 1 in 10
to the 4, something small.

01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:34.270
Because it's probably only
10% the locations on the gene

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:35.590
would actually knock it out.

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:37.100
I'm making up that number.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.640
The protein guys would
have a much better sense.

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.439
But it's going to
be a small number.

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:43.410
It might only be 1% of
the mutations, actually,

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:46.140
would actually knock out
the function of the protein.

01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.690
And then not all of the genome
actually codes for proteins.

01:09:49.690 --> 01:09:51.689
So you start multiplying
small numbers together,

01:09:51.689 --> 01:09:53.439
and you get something
that's rather small.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.810
But there will be some
number of mutations there.

01:09:55.810 --> 01:09:57.640
However, the vast
majority of mutations

01:09:57.640 --> 01:10:00.780
will have no measurable
fitness effect.

01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:06.600
So indeed, this thing kind
of peaks here, and then

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:07.880
rather sharply comes down.

01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:12.440
And this is on a linear
scale, or something like that.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.680
So the width might
indeed be a few percent.

01:10:20.210 --> 01:10:23.480
But actually, probably
even less, maybe 1%,

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.182
or half, something small.

01:10:26.182 --> 01:10:26.682
Yeah.

01:10:26.682 --> 01:10:29.670
AUDIENCE: How skewed is it?

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:32.205
PROFESSOR: So on a linear
scale, it doesn't look skewed.

01:10:32.205 --> 01:10:34.120
On a log scale, I think it does.

01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.550
I mean, in the sense that
if you plot log frequency

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:38.700
on this axis, then
there's a longer tail

01:10:38.700 --> 01:10:40.520
on the left than on the right.

01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.350
But I'd say on a linear scale,
it's just pretty sharp function

01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:44.850
there.

01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:46.475
AUDIENCE: So people
have measured that?

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:50.760
PROFESSOR: Certainly for
all the gene knockouts,

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.080
we have measured this.

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:55.980
And even that distribution
is sharply peaked.

01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.570
So the point mutation
distribution's

01:10:58.570 --> 01:11:00.926
going to be even
more tightly peaked.

01:11:00.926 --> 01:11:02.509
AUDIENCE: For most
genes, you can just

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:04.284
knock them out and [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:04.284 --> 01:11:04.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:05.450
Sorry.

01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:07.990
So for most genes, at least
in many environments--

01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:10.406
and of course, it depends on
what environment you measure.

01:11:10.406 --> 01:11:12.420
But for most genes,
you can knock them out.

01:11:12.420 --> 01:11:14.670
Certainly in rich media,
most genes you can knock out.

01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:31.400
This, as I said, might be
1 in 10 to the minus 3, 4.

01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:37.770
I might be off by a couple
orders of magnitude.

01:11:37.770 --> 01:11:40.950
But the point is that this is
a small fraction over here.

01:11:40.950 --> 01:11:41.612
Most are here.

01:11:41.612 --> 01:11:44.070
And there will be some point
mutations that come down here.

01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:46.210
But on a linear scale, it's
going to be very small.

01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:53.270
Now from the standpoint
of a population evolving

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:55.490
to a new environment,
which mutations

01:11:55.490 --> 01:11:57.292
are we most interested in?

01:11:57.292 --> 01:11:58.600
AUDIENCE: The beneficial.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.099
PROFESSOR: The
beneficial mutations.

01:12:00.099 --> 01:12:02.840
So we're most interested
in these guys.

01:12:05.870 --> 01:12:09.250
And indeed, this
is the distribution

01:12:09.250 --> 01:12:14.120
that [INAUDIBLE] set out to try
and measure in that experiment

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.180
that we just read
about last night.

01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:19.840
So he wanted to know,
if you zoom in here--

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.400
because remember, this is even
narrower than I've actually

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.400
drawn.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.320
But this distribution,
the probability

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:32.110
of a beneficial mutation
of magnitude s-- s, here 0,

01:12:32.110 --> 01:12:36.555
s-- it's going to do something.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.915
Many mutations that
are nearly neutral,

01:12:40.915 --> 01:12:42.540
but it's going to
fall off in some way,

01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:44.660
and they wanted to
try and measure this.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:48.190
Now how many mutations
confer a 2% advantage, 4%,

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:49.690
for this particular
E. coli strain

01:12:49.690 --> 01:12:52.810
in that particular environment?

01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:55.874
But it turned out being
difficult to measure.

01:12:55.874 --> 01:12:57.790
And what was the reason
that they gave for why

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:58.956
it was difficult to measure?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:06.540
Somebody?

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:07.201
Anybody?

01:13:07.201 --> 01:13:07.700
Please?

01:13:16.208 --> 01:13:17.124
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:21.526 --> 01:13:22.150
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:13:22.150 --> 01:13:23.691
But the equivalence
principle doesn't

01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:26.860
say that they're all
equivalent necessarily.

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:31.523
AUDIENCE: Well, you can
make different [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:31.523 --> 01:13:33.064
So there are different
distributions,

01:13:33.064 --> 01:13:35.530
and they each have
their perimeters

01:13:35.530 --> 01:13:36.199
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:13:36.199 --> 01:13:37.574
AUDIENCE: You can
pick perimeters

01:13:37.574 --> 01:13:43.140
for each of them, such that
they will give you the same--

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.570
PROFESSOR: OK, that's right.

01:13:44.570 --> 01:13:47.440
So what they found was
that different underlying

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:50.724
distributions-- this
probability distribution

01:13:50.724 --> 01:13:52.140
for beneficial
mutations, function

01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:55.200
of s-- different
underlying distributions

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:58.570
could give you the same final
output in their measurements.

01:13:58.570 --> 01:13:59.430
But why was that?

01:14:05.850 --> 01:14:06.560
Yeah, John?

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:09.162
AUDIENCE: The only thing you
can measure is what fixes.

01:14:09.162 --> 01:14:09.870
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:13.590
So you can only
measure what it fixes,

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:17.130
or becomes significant
fraction population, 10%.

01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:18.805
Only measure what
fixes or grows.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.442
And what does that mean?

01:14:25.442 --> 01:14:29.292
AUDIENCE: Well, it means that
you're not probing [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:30.000
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.484
It means that we're not probing
that distribution, and why not?

01:14:32.484 --> 01:14:33.400
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:36.064 --> 01:14:36.730
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:39.105
But why is it that we only
see part of this distribution?

01:14:39.105 --> 01:14:40.520
What was their--

01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:42.510
AUDIENCE: We don't see
the ones that die out.

01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:44.426
PROFESSOR: We don't see
the ones that die out.

01:14:44.426 --> 01:14:46.430
And why is that they die out?

01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:48.055
Or why is it that they--

01:14:48.055 --> 01:14:49.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:52.540
PROFESSOR: OK, yeah.

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:53.200
Yes.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.699
So the fact of
stochastic extinction

01:14:54.699 --> 01:14:55.790
is very relevant here.

01:14:55.790 --> 01:14:57.790
And I think that in this
paper they a little bit

01:14:57.790 --> 01:15:01.250
underplay that aspect of it,
because they're primarily

01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:03.410
arguing that it was
another effect that led

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:05.680
to this equivalence principle.

01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:06.924
Right?

01:15:06.924 --> 01:15:07.890
AUDIENCE: Competition.

01:15:07.890 --> 01:15:09.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
clonal interference.

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:11.101
I mean, that's why we
spent the last hour talking

01:15:11.101 --> 01:15:12.780
about clonal interference.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.870
So their argument
in this paper was

01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:16.950
that, as a result of
clonal interference,

01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:19.960
competition between
these different lineages,

01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:22.280
then the distribution
of fitness effects

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.350
that you measure,
that fix, is not

01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:26.600
the distribution that was
the underlying distribution.

01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:34.240
Because less fit beneficial
mutations get out-competed.

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.850
But there's a very
important question,

01:15:35.850 --> 01:15:41.540
which is, let's imagine
that let's have mu go to 0.

01:15:44.550 --> 01:15:46.060
Or we go to small populations.

01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:50.250
Let's say that after
reading his paper

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:52.690
I said, OK, well, yeah,
because of clonal interference

01:15:52.690 --> 01:15:55.829
I can't measure this probability
distribution in the set up

01:15:55.829 --> 01:15:56.370
that he used.

01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:59.300
But maybe if I go to
small population sizes,

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:03.280
or I reduce the mutation
rate somehow-- magic--

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.850
then would this allow me to
measure that distribution?

01:16:07.850 --> 01:16:09.470
So I'm going to ask
you guys to vote.

01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:10.370
So mu, let's say.

01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:12.470
Our experiment, I
have mu go to 0.

01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:16.990
Does this mean that when
I then go do write CFP,

01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:21.610
YFP, they're 50-50, and
then you start doing this.

01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:25.227
And we measure the
slope to get s,

01:16:25.227 --> 01:16:26.435
just like in this experiment.

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:38.100
If I plot the distribution
of resulting s's, no clonal

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:41.660
interference anymore, because
I've set mu equal to 0.

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:45.160
So this thing goes to infinity.

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.710
Do I recover the
underlying distribution?

01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:51.710
Ready.

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:57.210
So P be measured,
as a function of s,

01:16:57.210 --> 01:17:00.380
is it equal to the true one?

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:01.080
Question mark.

01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:10.150
I'm going to give you 15
seconds to think about this.

01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:31.350
Ready.

01:17:31.350 --> 01:17:35.150
Three, two, one.

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:35.650
All right.

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:38.880
So we have, I'd say,
a majority of nos.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.550
And can somebody say why not?

01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:43.540
AUDIENCE: You can't really
see the established mutation.

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:44.540
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:47.130
Because even if you don't
have clonal interference,

01:17:47.130 --> 01:17:48.850
you still only see
the mutations that

01:17:48.850 --> 01:17:51.547
survive so stochastic
extinction.

01:17:51.547 --> 01:17:53.380
And I think this is a
really important point

01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:55.338
that, at least in a first
reading of the paper,

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:57.460
you might not realize.

01:17:57.460 --> 01:17:57.960
Yeah, John.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:58.876
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:01.170 --> 01:18:02.170
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:05.300
So in principle, we know that
the probability of survival

01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.730
goes as s.

01:18:07.730 --> 01:18:10.460
But you end up losing a
fair amount of information.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:15.620
So for example, let's say that
this thing is an exponential.

01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.990
So this is Pb of s.

01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:21.180
Let's just say it's
an exponential.

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:24.770
And indeed, from some ideas
from extreme value theory,

01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:28.226
there are arguments that maybe
this should be an exponential.

01:18:28.226 --> 01:18:29.600
And if you're
curious about this,

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:32.550
come and ask me after class.

01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:35.480
But let's just imagine that
this thing is exponential.

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:37.420
Now the question is
what would we actually

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:42.940
measure in this
experiment in the absence

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940
of clonal interference?

01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:50.172
Would we measure
a distribution--

01:18:50.172 --> 01:18:53.390
would the distribution
be maximal

01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:57.230
at 0 or at some other value?

01:18:57.230 --> 01:18:58.690
Verbally, 0 or other value?

01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:00.804
Ready, three, two, one.

01:19:00.804 --> 01:19:01.720
AUDIENCE: Other value.

01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.800
PROFESSOR: Other value.

01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:06.250
And indeed, the probability
of surviving extinction,

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:10.170
remember this x1 goes as s
means that the distribution they

01:19:10.170 --> 01:19:12.090
actually measure
will start at 0,

01:19:12.090 --> 01:19:19.750
grow linearly,
and then fall off.

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:21.290
So this distribution
is essentially

01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:23.289
like this distribution
of the convolution of two

01:19:23.289 --> 01:19:30.410
exponentials, where this
thing goes up linearly,

01:19:30.410 --> 01:19:33.580
and then curves off.

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:37.240
So I think that a very important
point to realize in all of this

01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.370
is that this is probability
distribution that's

01:19:39.370 --> 01:19:46.220
measured as a function of s with
no clonal interference, right?

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:47.780
So the statement
is that even if you

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:49.890
don't have any clonal
interference, already

01:19:49.890 --> 01:19:51.723
you're going to measure
a peak distribution.

01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:00.521
The underlying distribution
will be peaked at 0.

01:20:00.521 --> 01:20:02.020
But what you measure
is always going

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:02.930
to be peaked somewhere else.

01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:04.550
And indeed, if you
go and you look

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:08.702
in the paper at the measured
alpha as a function of s,

01:20:08.702 --> 01:20:10.660
you see something that
looks kind of like this.

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:14.527
So it's a little bit difficult
to be absolutely certain.

01:20:14.527 --> 01:20:17.110
What's going on is that in the
absence of clonal interference,

01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.700
you get this.

01:20:17.700 --> 01:20:20.160
With clonal interference, let's
say you have two mutations

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:21.400
and you want to know, OK,
what are you going to measure?

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.355
Well, you sample from
this distribution twice,

01:20:23.355 --> 01:20:25.950
and you take the
larger of the two.

01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:27.910
Because this
distribution is already

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:31.050
the probability distribution of
mutations that get established.

01:20:31.050 --> 01:20:35.495
So then this is going to
grow as a quadratic here.

01:20:35.495 --> 01:20:37.040
If you have more
clonal interference,

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.800
then this thing shifts to
the right and gets tighter.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.506
So this is the process
by which you end up

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:44.630
with a peaked distribution.

01:20:47.294 --> 01:20:48.710
So what we're going
to do is we're

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:53.050
going to start in the first
15 minutes on Tuesday.

01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:56.530
We'll talk about this
experiment a bit more.

01:20:56.530 --> 01:20:59.440
And then we'll go on to think
about fitness landscapes

01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:00.930
and the rate of evolution.

01:21:00.930 --> 01:21:03.179
If you have any questions
about anything that we said,

01:21:03.179 --> 01:21:03.941
please come on up.

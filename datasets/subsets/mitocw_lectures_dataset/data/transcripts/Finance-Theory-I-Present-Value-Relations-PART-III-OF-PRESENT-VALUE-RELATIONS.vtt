00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.410
ANDREW LO: These are the
financial highlights of Lehman

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.780
Brothers as of the end of 2007.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.430
Now, you can get more
recent highlights

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.380
from looking at
their SEC filings,

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.170
their 10-K and 10-Qs
which are accounting

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.060
reports that they provide to
the SEC on a quarterly basis.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.710
But I just thought we'd take a
look at the annual financials

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.860
of this business.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.840
At the end of 2007, the net
revenues for Lehman Brothers

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.100
was $19 billion.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.560
This is a firm that earned $19
billion in revenues in 2007.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.709
We're not talking about
a small little shop here.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.170
This is a major
financial institution.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.770
And if you look at their
profits, their net income,

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.670
$4 billion of net
income in 2007.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.240
And 2007 was not a great
year, so $4 billion of income

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.900
is a pretty impressive number.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.500
And if you look at their
long-term capital, the capital

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.140
base, we're looking
at $145 billion.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.760
And if you take a look at
their assets under management,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:46.456
the assets under management,
in billions, is $282 billion

00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:49.830
of assets under management.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.780
Now, at the end of
2007, would anybody

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.530
have forecasted that
a company like this

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.660
could be gone nine months later?

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.370
Gone-- I mean, just obliterated.

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.139
28,500 employees, so we're
talking about major disruption

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:11.090
to the New York workforce.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.400
A number of people are going
to be looking for jobs.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.140
Now, a number of
jobs are going to be

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.120
created as a consequence
of these dislocations.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.310
I'll come to that in a minute.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.760
But this is an
extraordinary set of events.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.300
And one key to what's
going on and why

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.760
this might have happened
is this number right here,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.330
the net leverage ratio.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.060
That net leverage
ratio tells you

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.240
something about how much
exposure Lehman Brothers had

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.240
relative to how much capital
they're actually managing.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.120
And let me give you an example
of what I mean by that.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.630
And I'm going to give you a
personal example that we're

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.546
going to come back to.

00:02:57.546 --> 00:02:59.260
We talked about
mortgages last time,

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.510
and I told you all that
you now have the power

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.710
to compute mortgage payments.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.950
Well, you know that a
mortgage is a loan, right?

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.450
You're borrowing
money from the bank

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.950
to buy this beautiful home
that you want to live in.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.080
Does anybody know how
much money you typically

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.350
have to put down
when you buy a home?

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.850
Yeah.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:17.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.001
ANDREW LO: 20% is
the typical number,

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.820
although in recent years,
it's much less than that.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:27.000
For example, when I first
bought my home way back in 1988,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.480
my first home, when I
moved here to Boston,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.070
I actually only
had to put 5% down

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:39.710
because I was able to get a
jumbo loan and, in addition,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.610
purchase mortgage insurance
so that the bank was

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.350
willing to lend me quite a bit
more than they usually would.

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.570
Now, let's take the 20%
down as the standard number

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.320
because that is absolutely
industry standard.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.137
If you put down 20% for,
let's say, a $500,000 home--

00:03:59.137 --> 00:04:01.220
which in the Boston area
is a little starter home,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.430
I'm afraid--

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.390
a half a million dollar
home you put down $100,000.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.570
And the bank lends you $400,000.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.130
The value of your total assets
is, of course, 500,000, right?

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.310
You've got 100,000 of your own
money, 400,000 of the bank's

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.010
money, and with that 500,000,
you give it to the other party

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.040
to buy the home.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.070
And now you are the happy
owners of a $500,000 home.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.250
What kind of leverage ratio do
you have in that circumstance?

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.567
Anybody calculate that quickly?

00:04:32.567 --> 00:04:34.555
AUDIENCE: It's 4 to 1?

00:04:34.555 --> 00:04:37.390
ANDREW LO: Close, but no cigar.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.830
5 to 1, right?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.340
5 to 1 in the sense that you
have five times leverage.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.930
Your total exposure is 500.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.070
You've got 100.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.600
It's 5 to 1.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.150
Now, what does that
mean, 5 to 1 leverage?

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.750
That sounds scary.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.460
That sounds like you
are really levered up.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.110
Well, it's only scary if
the value of the assets

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:02.230
swings around a lot.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.720
For example, let's do a
simple back-of-the-envelope

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.290
calculation.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.590
Suppose house
prices fall by 10%.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.320
That's only 10%, right?

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.380
That's not a huge number.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.530
It's significant,
but it's not huge.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.980
What's the return
on your investment?

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.780
How much have you
invested in the home?

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.530
AUDIENCE: 100,000.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.390
ANDREW LO: $100,000.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.750
If the value of the
home falls by 10%,

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.340
how much has the value
of your assets fallen by?

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.010
50,000, right?

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.355
Of that 50,000, how
much does the bank lose?

00:05:37.355 --> 00:05:37.980
AUDIENCE: None.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.450
ANDREW LO: None, right,
because they've lent you money,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.140
and they expect
you to pay it back.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.360
They're not equity holders.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.970
They're not looking to
take on any downside risk.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.410
They just want their
money back with interest.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.400
So the bank doesn't
care what the value is.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.540
They still expect you to pay
back the $400,000 that they

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.200
lent you with interest.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:02.330
So that $50,000
loss, it's all yours.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.820
And you've put down 100,000,
and you've lost 50--

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.980
half of your assets
just got wiped out

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.560
with only a 10% move in
the value of the home.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.990
Now, instead of putting 20%
down as a standard, what

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.510
if you did what I did,
which is you put down 5%?

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:29.490
So 5% of $500,000
is $25,000, right?

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.850
The bank lends you $475,000.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.650
So this is not a
conforming loan.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.340
You've got to buy insurance,
and it's subprime,

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.900
so on and so forth.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.050
5% is your investment, $25,000.

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.920
Now, suppose housing
prices go down by 10%.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.098
What's the return
on your capital?

00:06:53.098 --> 00:06:54.550
AUDIENCE: Negative.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.530
ANDREW LO: Well, you've
lost everything, right?

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.840
The $50,000 loss is still
there, but you only put in 25.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.830
So you've now lost all of your
capital, and on top of that,

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.180
you're in the hole
for another 25.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.550
So you've actually lost not
only all of your wealth,

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.440
but actually, you've
lost more than all of it.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.960
You've lost minus 100% of your
wealth or your total return.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.470
Your net return is minus 200%.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.130
So, if you're a major
financial institution,

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:39.140
and you're leveraged 16 to 1,
and the value of that portfolio

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:46.730
declines by 10% or 20%, you
can go through capital very,

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:47.960
very quickly.

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.570
Now let's do a back
of the envelope.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.430
The amount of capital
that they have-- let's

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.620
go up and take a look at this.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.520
The amount of capital that
Lehman had is something like--

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.120
total long-term capital
$145 billion, OK?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:10.040
If you leverage that 16 to 1,
and then you ask the question,

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.030
with that leverage
amount of capital,

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:18.020
if it drops by, I
don't know, 10%, 5%,

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.330
7% of that total
asset base, you can

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.120
see how you can go through
$145 billion of capital

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.500
pretty quickly with leverage.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.210
Now, you might ask, why on
earth would anybody do this?

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.289
Why would you leverage 16 to 1?

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:38.610
Well, why would anybody
buy a house in New England

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.820
with 5% down?

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:41.809
That's just as crazy.

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:44.717
What's the leverage
ratio if you put 5% down?

00:08:44.717 --> 00:08:45.855
AUDIENCE: 20 to 1.

00:08:45.855 --> 00:08:47.230
ANDREW LO: 20 to
1, exactly, so I

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:51.852
was a proud leveraged investor
that had 20 to 1 leverage.

00:08:51.852 --> 00:08:52.810
I beat Lehman Brothers.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:56.440
Why would I do that?

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.270
Is that insane?

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.032
Well, yeah.

00:08:59.032 --> 00:09:01.240
AUDIENCE: So you don't
[? tie ?] up too much capital.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.320
ANDREW LO: Well, yes.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.030
That's a very polite
way of saying it.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.405
Yes, I would tie up too much
capital if I didn't do that.

00:09:06.405 --> 00:09:08.420
The fact is, I didn't
have the capital.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.920
So thank you for being kind.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.310
But why wasn't it nuts?

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:13.436
Yeah.

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:16.459
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:16.459 --> 00:09:17.250
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.420
If the value goes
up, then I earn

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.800
that kind of money,
the same kind of money.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.340
So if housing prices go up by
10%, then at 20 to 1 leverage,

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.410
I look like a hedge
fund manager, right?

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:32.929
Make a ton of money, but
that's not the only reason

00:09:32.929 --> 00:09:34.970
that I'm willing to do
that because you're saying

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.580
that I want to take that risk.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.170
Why would I do that?

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.522
Yeah, Michael.

00:09:40.522 --> 00:09:42.230
AUDIENCE: Well, your
risk seems very low.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.963
ANDREW LO: Why?

00:09:42.963 --> 00:09:44.463
AUDIENCE: Well, in
the past, there's

00:09:44.463 --> 00:09:46.379
nothing to indicate that
prices would go down.

00:09:46.379 --> 00:09:47.210
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:52.130
The risk of 20 to 1
leverage is only a risk

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.460
if the amount of housing
price fluctuation

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.310
is such that it could
actually wipe me out.

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:01.580
But up until very
recently, housing prices

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.590
have done nothing but this.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.816
They've gone up.

00:10:04.816 --> 00:10:06.440
And not only have
they gone up, they've

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.160
gone up in a very smooth
and orderly fashion.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.640
You know, if house prices went
up by 15% a year every year,

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:16.289
you might be thrilled,
but also a bit scared.

00:10:16.289 --> 00:10:17.330
That's not what happened.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:19.413
Housing prices have gone
up, maybe, I don't know--

00:10:19.413 --> 00:10:23.580
8%, 10%, 7%, 5%, 6%.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.490
It's been relatively smooth.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.610
And so the volatility,
the volatility

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:32.670
of those kinds of
investments were low enough

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.130
that the leverage
didn't scare me at all.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:37.320
And in fact, I
didn't lose money.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.410
I held that house for
about five or six years

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:44.080
and bought another
one, and it was fine.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.680
It was fine because
that kind of leverage

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.730
is not a problem as
long as the volatility

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.980
of the overall investment
wasn't out of hand.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.830
What happened over the
last two or three years

00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.540
is that the volatility
has gotten out of hand.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.780
And we're going to talk
about that Wednesday

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.040
at that pro seminar.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.620
I'm going to give you a concrete
illustration not only of how

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.640
it got out of hand, but
how financial engineering

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:12.220
and the design of
derivative securities

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.330
to expand the housing market and
provide people with these loans

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.120
exacerbated the problem
on the downside.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.310
But of course, the
purpose of it was

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:22.750
to help people on the upside.

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.850
It's exactly looking
at the investments

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.210
going up and thinking that,
gee, they could never come down.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.878
Yeah, question.

00:11:29.878 --> 00:11:32.253
AUDIENCE: What about the fact
that at the end of the day,

00:11:32.253 --> 00:11:33.862
you can live in your house?

00:11:33.862 --> 00:11:35.854
And the total valuation
of your house,

00:11:35.854 --> 00:11:38.350
if it goes down $100,000,
it's still a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.221
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:11:39.221 --> 00:11:41.220
AUDIENCE: So you only
have to deal with the mark

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.560
to market [? up and down. ?]

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.560
ANDREW LO: That's a
very important point.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.190
The mark to market.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.450
What does mark to market mean?

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.119
Anybody know?

00:11:49.119 --> 00:11:50.910
We've never used that
term in class so far.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.582
Yeah.

00:11:51.582 --> 00:11:54.294
AUDIENCE: It's something that
book value gets [? matched ?]

00:11:54.294 --> 00:11:55.650
[? together with ?] reality.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.650
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:12:00.000
When something that may
have a book value gets

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.810
marked to a reality check
in terms of market price.

00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.660
So for example,
the first lecture,

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.450
where I auctioned off
that little tiny box

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:11.400
that you had no idea
what was in there,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:13.350
it had no market
value beforehand,

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.720
at least not to any of you.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.730
But we marked it to market.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:21.100
We marked it to
market at 45 bucks.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.780
And so it established
a market price.

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:28.300
Now, the question is, who cares
what the value of the house is?

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:30.280
You're living in it,
you're enjoying it,

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.039
so what's the big deal?

00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:32.830
Well, that's right.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:36.490
It's not a big deal if you
enjoy living in the house,

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.610
and you can afford to pay
the mortgage, and you're OK.

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:43.490
And millions of homeowners
are exactly in that situation.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.440
So we can't forget that.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.190
That the subprime mortgage
has enabled literally

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.250
millions of homeowners
to become homeowners

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.700
who never could have.

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:57.480
But what if there's a problem
in terms of interest rates going

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.180
up and your mortgage
payment going up

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.270
because you ended up
getting a very low teaser

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.250
rate for your mortgage?

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.840
You've got an
adjustable rate mortgage

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.880
because they said, gee,
you could buy this house

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.650
with virtually no money down.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.560
And you've got
plenty of resources

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.500
to be able to pay for it because
your payment is only $300

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:17.280
a month.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.560
And then, a year later,
that mortgage payment

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.940
is $1,000 a month.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.710
Then it's a real problem.

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:25.110
OK, then you've got a decision.

00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.750
The decision is, are
you going to keep

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:32.310
paying all of your income
and have a hard time making

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:37.060
ends meet for a house
that you'll never

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.230
get the money back?

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.410
It's literally taking
your money and burning it

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:43.450
because you've lost your equity.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.520
And you've lost so much
more beyond your equity

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.260
that in order to
make money you'd

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:49.330
have to hold onto the
house for 20 years,

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:52.940
and you can't afford
the house anyway.

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.436
Do you do that?

00:13:54.436 --> 00:13:56.060
Or do you put the
key in the front door

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.150
and move out and say, you know
what, bank, it's all yours.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.990
I'm moving on.

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:02.740
That's what's happened
across the country.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.280
It's the fact that people
can't afford these mortgages

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.016
because they got in
at low teaser rates,

00:14:08.016 --> 00:14:10.140
and now the rates have come
up because the interest

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.490
rates have been going up.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.430
Now, something very significant
is going to happen tomorrow.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.100
Tomorrow, the Fed
is almost surely

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.350
going to cut rates
because they want

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:23.580
to reduce the pressure
on the system for exactly

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:24.510
these kinds of issues.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:28.320
They want to reduce the
kind of default rates.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.020
And by keeping
interest rates low,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.600
they actually are going
to be able to encourage

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.300
liquidity and reduce
the kind of pressure

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.400
that we've been seeing.

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.329
Yeah, question.

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:40.704
AUDIENCE: I was
going to ask what

00:14:40.704 --> 00:14:44.220
happens if you put your 5%
down, and the value of the house

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.415
goes down, say, 25%,
it's been only a year.

00:14:48.415 --> 00:14:50.531
You feel like you're not
going to get-- it's never

00:14:50.531 --> 00:14:51.447
going to come back up.

00:14:51.447 --> 00:14:55.050
Can you literally just go to
the bank and say it's yours?

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:57.660
ANDREW LO: Well, that depends
on what you signed when you got

00:14:57.660 --> 00:14:59.010
your mortgage from the bank.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.090
Most mortgage contracts are
known as non-recourse loans,

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:06.806
meaning that they've got
your house as collateral,

00:15:06.806 --> 00:15:07.930
but that's all they've got.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:09.640
They don't have
your firstborn, they

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.129
don't have your pinky finger.

00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:15.170
And depending on where
you borrow, in some cases,

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.440
you may have to give that up.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.470
But no, the fact of the
matter is the most they can do

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:23.530
is take your house
away and sell it.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.340
And a lot of homeowners are
saying, great, it's all yours.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.022
I'm moving out of
Stockton, California.

00:15:29.022 --> 00:15:29.980
I don't need the house.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.870
I don't need to have
these mortgage payments

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.670
where I'm throwing in
good money after bad.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.460
That's their perspective.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.410
AUDIENCE: What about
your credit score?

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.618
ANDREW LO: Yes, so your
credit score will go to hell.

00:15:40.618 --> 00:15:41.520
So you wait.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.450
So you'll wait five
years or seven years,

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.360
and then you'll be back again.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.120
There's a finite
limit on how long

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.910
they can keep those
kind of credit scores.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:56.080
And beyond a certain point,
you will have a clean record.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.931
But even with that
bad credit score--

00:15:58.931 --> 00:16:01.180
I mean, don't forget, that's
how the subprime mortgage

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.110
market got created.

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.341
You saw the TV ads, right?

00:16:03.341 --> 00:16:04.840
Doesn't matter if
you're in default,

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.310
doesn't matter if
you have no credit,

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:07.935
doesn't matter if
you don't have a job,

00:16:07.935 --> 00:16:10.110
we'll still give you a loan.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:13.420
Now, that's not true today,
or not as true today,

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:15.820
but at some point when
the market recovers,

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:17.680
we're going to see
that come back again.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.645
And so you will be
able to borrow again.

00:16:21.645 --> 00:16:23.285
Yeah.

00:16:23.285 --> 00:16:25.493
AUDIENCE: Given that the
interest rates are now going

00:16:25.493 --> 00:16:27.810
up, does that mean
the [INAUDIBLE]----

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:30.370
ANDREW LO: Going down.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:35.457
AUDIENCE: Despite the fact that
the financial cut [INAUDIBLE],,

00:16:35.457 --> 00:16:39.086
the actual interest rate
that homeowners are paying

00:16:39.086 --> 00:16:39.900
hasn't changed.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.140
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.431
AUDIENCE: So does that mean
that those with good credit

00:16:42.431 --> 00:16:44.840
are effectively subsidizing
those with bad credit?

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.530
ANDREW LO: Well, yes and no.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:49.810
I mean, I think that
the subsidization

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.500
that you're talking about really
happens very, very indirectly.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.740
The fact that there are
large numbers of defaults

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.980
ultimately may mean that it's
harder to get a subprime loan.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.630
So the folks that
are actually good

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.710
credits, but don't meet the
prime borrowing rate criteria,

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:07.970
yes, they will suffer.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:11.660
But at equilibrium-- by
equilibrium I mean when supply

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.430
equals demand--

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.710
the price is the
price is the price.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:20.030
So it depends on what kind
of a borrower you are,

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.310
but whatever type
of borrower you

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:26.210
are, if you can signal that
that's the type you are,

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:29.090
you will be able to get that
appropriate kind of credit.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.220
All right, so in
that sense, it's

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:33.530
not as if taxpayers
are footing the bill

00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:36.590
for the particular interest
rate shifts that are going on.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:39.050
Taxpayers may end up
footing the bill for what

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.450
happened with Bear Stearns,
what happened with Fannie

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:42.740
Mae and Freddie Mac.

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:45.910
And that's one of the reasons
why, over the weekend,

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:48.380
when the Fed was approached
by Lehman Brothers and said,

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.480
hey, you've got to
help us out here,

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.280
the Fed said, you know what?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.210
We're done with that.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:56.870
You know, sorry, but we can't
ask the American taxpayer

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:58.400
to foot this bill either.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:01.190
Otherwise there's going
to be tremendous backlash.

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.410
And so when Lehman
Brothers was left

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:06.050
without backing
from the Fed, they

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.289
went to a number of private
organizations like Barclays.

00:18:09.289 --> 00:18:11.330
Barclays said that they
would be willing to do it

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:13.850
if the Fed was able to
provide some kind of backstop.

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.766
The Fed was not willing
to provide a backstop,

00:18:15.766 --> 00:18:17.690
so Barclays said
thanks, but no thanks.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.410
And at that point, Lehman said,
we have no choice because we

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:26.090
cannot close a sale within a
matter of 24 to 48 hours from

00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:27.230
this point on.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.030
And we've got some
notes coming up.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:32.820
We've got to do something,
so they filed for Chapter 11.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.590
Yeah.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:35.030
AUDIENCE: If they cut the
rates [? as far as ?] they do,

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.470
what's the negative part?

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:37.430
Inflation?

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:38.340
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.490
We're actually going
to talk about that

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.860
in this next segment--

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:43.760
inflation.

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.210
If the Fed cuts
rates, one could argue

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.430
that the reason we're
in the mess that we are

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.860
is because the Fed
had kept the Fed funds

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:55.820
rate so low for so long
that even after the stock

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.310
market crashed with the
internet bubble bursting,

00:18:58.310 --> 00:19:01.790
the housing market
continued on with its bubble

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.830
because it was still
so cheap to borrow.

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:06.131
And I'm sure I've
mentioned before

00:19:06.131 --> 00:19:08.630
that when I was an assistant
professor at the Wharton School

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.550
back in 1986 looking
to buy a house,

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:15.070
the 30-year fixed was at 18%.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.170
18% for a 30-year
fixed mortgage.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:20.180
I didn't do it because I
couldn't afford it at the time,

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.570
but think about
that versus today.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:27.970
Mortgage rates are maybe at
a recent high of 6%, 7%, 8%.

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.320
That's not bad, relative
to historical standards.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.430
OK, so yes, I mean, I
think that's the concern

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.810
that if we keep
interest rates too low,

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.580
that's going to
encourage inflation.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.530
And inflation will
have its own costs.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:45.760
Anybody who's from any
Latin American country

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:49.184
will know the ghost of inflation
is tremendously frightening.

00:19:49.184 --> 00:19:51.100
And we don't want to let
that get out of hand.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.290
If you remember
back to the 1970s,

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:56.650
we had some inflation in the
US that was a real problem.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.000
So we're going to talk about
that in just a couple minutes.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:00.970
Any other?

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:01.737
Yes.

00:20:01.737 --> 00:20:05.216
AUDIENCE: I mean, is one
thing to do [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:05.216 --> 00:20:07.204
You said that when
the market comes back,

00:20:07.204 --> 00:20:10.190
we will still have
another bubble.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:11.550
ANDREW LO: Absolutely, yes.

00:20:11.550 --> 00:20:13.650
AUDIENCE: And do you
think this is reasonable?

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:15.840
ANDREW LO: Do I think
it's reasonable?

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.810
You're not allowed to ask
that question to an economist.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.680
Or rather, an economist is
not allowed to answer that.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.580
Reasonable is relative.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.704
And there are moral
and ethical overtones

00:20:29.704 --> 00:20:31.620
that economists don't
like to get involved in.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.400
It's human nature.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.017
Is it human to suffer
from fear and greed?

00:20:38.017 --> 00:20:39.600
Well, yes, and I
don't think I'm going

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.210
to change that any
time soon, nor are you

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:44.590
going to be able to
change that any time soon.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:47.070
So that's one of
the reasons why we

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:51.140
study finance is to develop an
intellectual and disciplined

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.890
framework for thinking
about these issues.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:54.840
Because if you
don't, if you don't

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:57.180
have a framework for
thinking about this,

00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:00.090
then you're left responding
to fear and greed.

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:05.430
Right now, we are in the
absolute grips of fear.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.320
Those of you who aren't
in financial markets,

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.210
if you read the papers,
my guess is you'll

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.690
start getting scared anyway.

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:13.230
And if you're in
financial markets,

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.960
I promise you this
is the scariest time

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.660
that we've been in, including
August of '98, October '87,

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.050
'94, 2001.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:28.440
All of the kind of periods
of market dislocation

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.102
is trumped by what's been going
on over the last few weeks.

00:21:32.102 --> 00:21:34.560
And it's exciting from the
point of view of being a finance

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.930
student because you actually
have the opportunity

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.160
to understand and do
something about this.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.020
But it requires a certain
discipline to do that.

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.110
Yeah, Ingrid.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.610
AUDIENCE: What does it exactly
mean that Lehman Brothers are

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:47.110
bankrupt?

00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:51.264
Because everybody, I guess
it's not a written one,

00:21:51.264 --> 00:21:54.510
but if I have some
money deposited there,

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:58.410
will they give it back to
me because I am a liability?

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.330
ANDREW LO: Well, that's
exactly the problem.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:03.470
The answer is I don't know.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:05.970
And that's one of the reasons
why there is this dislocation.

00:22:05.970 --> 00:22:07.710
Nobody knows
because nobody knows

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:11.310
how large the losses could be.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.159
And part of the thing
is that the losses

00:22:13.159 --> 00:22:14.950
at Lehman and other
financial institutions,

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:15.991
including Merrill Lynch--

00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:18.720
Merrill Lynch in some ways has
bigger exposure than Lehman.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.220
The difference is
that Merrill Lynch

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.690
has other sources
of revenue that

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.440
are able to let it get
through this situation a bit

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.330
more gracefully.

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.220
But the problem is we
don't know because we

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.910
don't know how the value
of these large assets

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.080
are going to be valued.

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.110
If you value them at zero,
then they're in deep trouble.

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:38.567
And not only are
the shareholders

00:22:38.567 --> 00:22:40.650
going to get wiped out,
but a lot of the creditors

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:41.850
are going to get wiped out.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.700
If you value them at
what they're valued now,

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.790
well, then there are going to
be some hiccups along the way,

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:49.710
but a number of
people should get out

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:53.127
without outrageous losses.

00:22:53.127 --> 00:22:55.626
AUDIENCE: And can't you sort
of declare default, stop paying

00:22:55.626 --> 00:23:02.009
now, until thing get better?

00:23:02.009 --> 00:23:04.300
I'm sort of applying my Latin
American experience here.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.910
ANDREW LO: Yes, yes.

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.970
I mean that's exactly what
filing for bankruptcy does.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:12.450
When you file for bankruptcy,
you basically go to the courts

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:17.670
and say, I cannot
make good on my IOUs.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.200
And I recognize that
this is a problem.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.420
So I'm going to ask the court
to appoint a conservator

00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.250
or supervisor to
oversee the disposition

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.130
and dissolution of
my assets in order

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:36.540
to make an orderly transition
to pay off all of the creditors.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.440
And you know who's last in line?

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.009
Shareholders.

00:23:40.009 --> 00:23:40.550
That's right.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:42.620
So most people think
the shareholders

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.670
are going to get
nothing, which is

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.850
kind of astonishing because
take a look at their closing

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.920
price in 2007.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.300
The closing price of Lehman
Brothers stock, $62 a share

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:57.280
at the end of 2007.

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.520
Nine months later,
it's worth zero.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.700
Zero, from $62 a share.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.240
That's a huge
destruction of value.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:07.990
And you know what?

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:13.870
Part of that loss in value is
really due to the loss of brand

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:17.030
and the loss of
business viability.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.120
It's intangible assets.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.810
It's not like all of a sudden,
the Lehman investment bankers

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:26.380
and proprietary traders
and asset managers,

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.150
they had brain damage and
they're a lot stupider

00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:30.350
than they used to be.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.980
They're just as smart, just
as savvy, just as experienced,

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.100
just as knowledgeable
as ever were.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.560
The problem is that
because of the magnitude

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:41.710
of their exposures,
there is general concern

00:24:41.710 --> 00:24:43.870
about their viability
as a business.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.180
And when you don't want to
do business with them, when

00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.179
everybody doesn't want
to do business with them,

00:24:48.179 --> 00:24:50.140
when nobody wants to
do business with them,

00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.550
they're not a business.

00:24:51.550 --> 00:24:55.870
And the value of their
business goes to zero.

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:58.110
And so there's a
chicken and egg problem

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:01.020
and you know the bottom
line is that irrespective

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.520
of whether it's the chicken or
the egg, when the egg breaks,

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.200
you're done.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:07.060
Yeah?

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.165
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Bear Stearns [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:10.165 --> 00:25:10.790
extremely high?

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.710
ANDREW LO: Yes, what
happened with Lehman

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.600
is quite similar to
what happened with Bear.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:21.710
Except that with Bear,
there was a panic

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:25.950
that was triggered by what seems
to be some kind of a rumor,

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:28.550
not necessarily large
exposures coming due.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.380
Bear Stearns
actually hedge funds

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.740
that were engaged in these kinds
of subprime mortgages, CDOs

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.300
and CDSs.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.360
Those funds went under
during the summer.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.540
But Bear Stearns as a business
collapsed because individuals

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.760
really didn't want to
do business with it

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.140
because of this kind of a risk.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:47.030
And the same thing
happened at Lehman.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.830
Except Lehman's exposure
was much larger.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.830
They have much larger
exposure to these markets.

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.610
They're one of the
biggest players

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.130
in these particular
kinds of securities.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.705
OK, because we're
running short on time,

00:25:57.705 --> 00:25:59.330
I'd like to just take
one more question

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:00.962
and then let me go
on with our lecture.

00:26:00.962 --> 00:26:02.420
And believe it or
not, we are going

00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.700
to cover material
exactly related

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:07.200
to this when we start talking
about fixed income securities.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.282
So this is very much apropos.

00:26:09.282 --> 00:26:11.553
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:11.553 --> 00:26:13.365
AUDIENCE: How do you
think this affects us

00:26:13.365 --> 00:26:15.630
in terms of the people
that want to [? be bias? ?]

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.490
ANDREW LO: Yeah, great question.

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:22.910
AUDIENCE: [? 25,000 ?] people
from Lehman [INAUDIBLE] jobs

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:23.974
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:23.974 --> 00:26:24.890
ANDREW LO: Absolutely.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:26.670
So this is a great question.

00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:29.220
I'm actually talk about that
specifically Wednesday evening.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:32.220
But let me let me give
you the short answer now.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.940
The short answer is that within
the next two or three months,

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.550
Wall Street will be frozen.

00:26:40.994 --> 00:26:43.160
They're going to be a deer
caught in the headlights.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.687
They won't know what's going on.

00:26:44.687 --> 00:26:46.520
They won't know what
their hiring plans are.

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:48.750
They won't know the
number of slots.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.590
There's resumes
flying back and forth.

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:53.090
So it's going to be a bit of
chaos for the next two or three

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.660
months.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:57.240
It's not clear that that's
going to affect you.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.450
Because internships
still have to be filled.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:05.250
Entry level positions are
actually of least concern

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.260
to businesses because
those are the ones

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.140
that they want to fill
because the new generation are

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.120
hungry and smart.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.519
Ready to do anything, take
on anything, and cheap.

00:27:14.519 --> 00:27:15.060
That's right.

00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.960
I didn't want to say
that but you said that.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.622
Good value.

00:27:19.622 --> 00:27:20.580
Let me put it that way.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.251
You're a good value.

00:27:23.251 --> 00:27:24.750
So what's going to
happen is it will

00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:27.420
be virtually impossible
for a senior managing

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:29.970
director from one
firm to easily get

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:31.890
a job at another firm
within the next two

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:34.320
or three months until
things settle down.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.110
At the entry level job
market, I suspect that there

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.730
will be some disruption.

00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:41.370
For example, just
a simple indication

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.580
of that today after
my 4 o'clock session,

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.370
I was supposed to meet with
the CFO of Bank of America, Joe

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:48.090
Price.

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.650
As many of you
know, we established

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.108
a relationship with
Bank of America

00:27:51.108 --> 00:27:54.750
just recently-- the Laboratory
for Financial Engineering

00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.750
to work with B of A to do
some interesting research

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.570
and to get access to
their tremendous database.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:02.880
And we were going to launch
that set of discussions

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.730
today with Joe Price.

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:07.920
Not surprisingly, at
3:00 in the morning,

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.990
I got an email from
a B of A employee

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.904
saying that he will not be
coming to MIT today after all.

00:28:12.904 --> 00:28:14.070
He was a little bit tied up.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:21.360
By the way, B of A also looked
at Lehman over the weekend.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:25.664
So over the weekend, B of A
folks wee pretty busy shopping.

00:28:25.664 --> 00:28:26.580
They looked at Lehman.

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:30.600
But again, when the
Fed wouldn't guarantee

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.260
any kind of a backstop for
Lehman, B of A passed as well.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.610
So that's an example of
the kind of dislocation

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:38.360
I'm talking about.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.520
There will be scheduling
glitches and things like that.

00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:45.580
Going forward though, after
the two or three months,

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:48.130
I actually think this
is a fantastic time

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:49.600
to get into the industry.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.290
Because when you have
these kind of dislocations,

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:55.480
opportunities get created.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.540
And opportunities for
people that are smart,

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.610
that are hungry, that are
willing to work hard--

00:29:00.610 --> 00:29:02.740
I mean, that's exactly
the kind of situation

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.880
that you want to be in.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.850
When things are going
well, they don't need you.

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.130
They're going to hire
people just to be clerks

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.900
and to get people lunch.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.180
But now is the time where you
can actually have a big impact.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.690
So rather than be discouraged,
I think all of you

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:20.524
have perfect timing in terms
of being in school now.

00:29:20.524 --> 00:29:21.940
In two years time,
you'll get out.

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:23.620
That's when all
of the businesses

00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.500
are going to be recovering and
certainly doing quite well,

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.460
I suspect.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.450
And even within the
next six months,

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.302
you're going to see
that a number of firms

00:29:31.302 --> 00:29:32.260
are going to be hiring.

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.385
And by the way, the
dislocation we're talking about

00:29:34.385 --> 00:29:35.980
is on the broker-dealer side.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:39.310
On the asset management side,
hedge funds, pension funds,

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:42.070
asset management companies,
foundations, endowments,

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.650
non-financial corporations--
they're hiring

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:47.320
and they need people
with financial expertise

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.050
to deal with these kind
of market dislocations.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:52.090
So I think that the job
prospects are actually

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.030
quite bright for this
class and the class after.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:57.910
The folks that are going to be
in a little bit of a tough bind

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.757
are the second years who will
be interviewing for their jobs

00:30:00.757 --> 00:30:02.090
in the next two or three months.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.274
They may end up having to
wait a little bit longer.

00:30:04.274 --> 00:30:06.190
And I suspect that they
will take a little bit

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:07.510
longer to settle on their jobs.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.030
But even then, MIT
students end up having

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.130
a bit of an advantage
over other MBAs simply

00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.900
because of the expertise
that we bring to the table.

00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:16.430
OK.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.430
So sorry about taking
them so much of your time,

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.699
but I think this is relevant and
will be useful for what we're

00:30:21.699 --> 00:30:22.990
going to be talking about next.

00:30:26.830 --> 00:30:30.070
Let me turn to what we ended
with in the last class, which

00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:32.710
is the inflation topic.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:38.350
Last class, you'll recall, we
talked about the two formulas

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:40.690
that you're going
to know very well

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.640
by the end of this
course, perpetuities

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.070
and annuities and compounding.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:48.490
And where we ended with was
this notion of inflation.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:51.670
How many of you already know
what inflation is and you've

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:54.220
talked about it in macro?

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.340
OK, some of you.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.580
So let me go over it briefly.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:31:00.070
And I think you'll see
very quickly exactly

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:01.900
what the idea is.

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:06.040
It's really meant to capture
the fact that the purchasing

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:11.380
power of your money can
vary over time, irrespective

00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:14.230
of the time value of money.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:16.510
And let me explain it this way--

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:20.440
at a particular point in
time, let's say time t,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:23.230
you've got a certain
amount of wealth, wt.

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:28.330
And the value of the kinds of
things that you like to buy

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:29.890
is given by an index.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:30.580
Call it I sub t.

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:34.240
So you could think about that
as the price of the basket

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.210
of goods that you enjoy.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.210
OK?

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:43.510
So this will include consumer
items, food, clothing.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:46.610
As well, it may include other
items-- leisure, entertainment,

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.480
and so on.

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.310
And the fact that you have
a certain amount of wealth

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.730
doesn't really tell
you how happy you are.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:58.370
It's really how much
you're able to consume.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.220
How you use that wealth that
tells you how happy you are.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:03.470
So economists
really like to focus

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:07.700
not on total wealth as a measure
of your standard of living,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.070
but how you are able
to consume that wealth.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.620
So we're going to come up with
a basket of consumption goods

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:18.080
and call that price of that
basket, I sub t, all right?

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.360
Now let's move from time
t to a different point

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.740
in time, t plus k.

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:24.440
So k periods from
now, you're going

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.600
to have a different
amount of wealth.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.580
Hopefully bigger.

00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:32.620
And presumably, you're going
to be able to consume more.

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:37.120
Well, that's presuming
that the prices of what you

00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:41.220
like to consume don't change.

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.320
But if those prices do
change, then in fact,

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.470
you might not be really
better off in any way.

00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:50.840
And so in order for you
to tell whether or not

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.420
you're better off
or worse off, you

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:56.790
need to know not only
how much wealth you have,

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:59.790
but how much that wealth can
buy you in terms of the stuff

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.780
that you like to consume.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:07.440
So the idea behind inflation
is to measure the purchasing

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.500
power of your dollar.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:14.680
And that's completely different
from time value of money.

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.550
Time value of money simply
says that people are impatient

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.660
and they prefer money
now to money later.

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:25.820
But inflation is a comment
about the purchasing

00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:30.080
power of that dollar
now versus later.

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.440
And it can go either way.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.630
In other words, it's possible
that a dollar next year

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:39.440
will buy you more
than a dollar today

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:43.400
because if prices decline, as
they have right now for energy,

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.000
for example.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.340
Energy is below $100 a barrel.

00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:49.290
Just a few months ago,
it was at $130 a barrel.

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:52.220
So if we had a winter
a few months ago,

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.100
that would have been really bad
because home heating oil would

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:56.683
have been a lot more
expensive than it

00:33:56.683 --> 00:33:57.890
looks like it's going to be.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:00.140
However, it's still going
to be more expensive than it

00:34:00.140 --> 00:34:05.070
was two years ago, when
oil was at $40 a barrel.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.910
So you need to know
what you're going

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:09.409
to consume in order to get a
sense of whether you are better

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:10.174
or worse off.

00:34:10.174 --> 00:34:11.840
And that's what we
measure by this price

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.280
index, I of t plus k.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.889
So when you're looking
at your portfolio,

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:19.270
you might ask the
question what's

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:21.250
my return on my portfolio.

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:23.110
And the way you
calculate that return

00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:27.010
is look at your wealth at time
t plus k divided by your wealth

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:30.540
at time t, subtract 1 from it.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.670
And that's your return, right?

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:36.120
That's often called
the nominal return

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.510
because it's in
name only, meaning

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:43.350
it's the actual
number of dollar bills

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:45.120
that your wealth will grow to.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.820
So if you've got
$1,000 this year,

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:51.719
next year you've got
$1,100, your nominal return

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:53.610
for your wealth is 10%.

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.739
That's the number
of dollar bills

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:58.050
you'll have more than
you had this year.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.240
10% more.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.500
Now if you want
to know how you're

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:04.860
doing in terms of your
level of happiness,

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:07.290
your purchasing power,
your cost of living,

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.030
your standard of
living, you've got

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:13.020
to look at what's going on
with a cost of living increase.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:16.530
I sub t plus k
divided by I sub t.

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:23.860
And we can write that as a
fixed growth rate, pi, per year.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:26.790
1 plus pi to the k

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:29.610
So let's suppose that all
the prices of the things

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:32.120
you love and enjoy--

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.650
they go up by 10% as well.

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.750
Well, then have
you made any money?

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.400
Have you made any progress?

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.890
You've made money, but
you haven't made progress.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:46.960
You've made 10% in terms of your
return on your initial $1,000.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:52.270
But the stuff that you like
to eat and buy and use--

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:54.530
that's also gone up by 10%.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:59.420
So in fact, you can't do any
more consumption next year

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.150
than you could have this year.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:04.030
Because while your wealth went
up by 10%, the cost of living

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.400
went up by 10%.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.070
So from a real perspective--

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.660
real meaning what you
really care about--

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.950
you haven't really
made any progress.

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.370
Inflation is a measure of
how much progress we've made.

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.210
And so when you
engage in analysis

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:26.900
of these kinds of
present value problems,

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:29.810
you've got to ask the
question whether or not

00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:36.320
you're focusing on nominal
returns or real returns, OK?

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:40.190
And ultimately, as a consumer,
what you all care about

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.570
is real returns.

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:45.830
You want to know whether you're
getting better off in terms

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:48.770
of what you can really consume.

00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:51.780
So how do you do that.

00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.620
Well, first of all, you
have to change the units.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.256
Sorry, question?

00:36:57.256 --> 00:36:59.110
AUDIENCE: Why pi?

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:01.352
ANDREW LO: Why that letter?

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:02.807
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:02.807 --> 00:37:03.890
ANDREW LO: Oh, no, no, no.

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.050
I'm sorry.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.090
Thank you for pointing it out.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.630
No, by pi, I just mean a
variable name called pi.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:15.550
I don't mean 3.14159.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:18.796
Only at MIT would I
get that question.

00:37:18.796 --> 00:37:20.170
I've taught at
other universities

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:22.870
and they ask me what
that funny-looking symbol

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.640
looks like.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.490
So yeah, sorry about that.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:31.030
This is just a Greek letter
that denotes a variable.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.661
It's like r or something.

00:37:32.661 --> 00:37:33.160
All right?

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.690
Thank you.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:38.050
So here, what I've
done is to define

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:42.700
a variable called your real
wealth at time t plus k.

00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.550
Real meaning this
is what you really

00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:49.060
can do with your money
in terms of consuming.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:52.730
What it is is your
nominal wealth divided

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.400
by the rate of inflation.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.610
So in the case of the
example I gave you,

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:02.150
where your nominal
wealth goes up by 10%

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:07.440
and your inflation rate
goes up by 10%, when

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.530
you take your nominal
wealth and you divide it

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:14.430
by that growth rate in
inflation, what do you get?

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:20.160
You get $1,000.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.060
In other words, your wealth
hasn't changed in real terms.

00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:24.840
OK?

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.530
So in the example that I gave
you your wealth went up by 10%.

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:32.470
Your inflation rate
for a year is also 10%.

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:38.334
So if you divide your
total wealth by that index,

00:38:38.334 --> 00:38:39.750
you're basically
going to get back

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:43.560
to your original amount
of wealth, right?

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.100
So here's the general framework.

00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:51.990
Your real wealth is going to
be your nominal wealth divided

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:54.350
by the rate of inflation.

00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:55.880
You're dividing by
it because you're

00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:01.460
using, as your units of
comparison, today's consumption

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:02.816
basket.

00:39:02.816 --> 00:39:05.390
Right?

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:10.100
So the way you can look at your
real return, which is denoted 1

00:39:10.100 --> 00:39:15.710
plus r real to the k-th power,
your real return over k years

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:19.520
is equal to the real wealth at
the end of year k years divided

00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.475
by your wealth today.

00:39:20.475 --> 00:39:22.100
That's your real rate
of return, right?

00:39:22.100 --> 00:39:27.630
Because it's how much real
dollars you have at time k.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:32.070
That's just given
by your nominal rate

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:34.880
of return of your wealth.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:38.750
And then divided by
the rate of inflation.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.080
OK?

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.200
So this is the
expression that is

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:49.080
the basic relationship between
real and nominal consumption

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.260
goods.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:54.480
And then we
approximate this ratio

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.510
with this very, very
simple relationship here.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:00.910
The real rate of
return is approximately

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:06.160
equal to the nominal rate of
return minus the inflation

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.630
rate-- not divided by anything.

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.610
That's the approximation.

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:11.970
So getting back to my example.

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:14.920
My example of if you
have a 10% nominal growth

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:20.060
rate for your investment and
you have a 10% inflation rate,

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.570
then in that case,
there's no approximation.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.720
In fact, your inflation rate,
your real rate of return,

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.100
is zero, right?

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.300
10% minus 10% is zero.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.850
Where the approximation
happens is

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:34.080
when you have something
a little bit different.

00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:38.640
For example, suppose the
inflation rate were 10%

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.846
and suppose your nominal
rate of return was 15%.

00:40:41.846 --> 00:40:43.470
According to this
approximation, what's

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.990
your real rate of return?

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.900
5%, right.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:56.470
It's not exactly 5% because if
you take 1.15 divided by 1.10,

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:58.780
it's not exactly 5%.

00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:00.970
But it's approximately
equal to that.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:02.980
OK?

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.080
What this says is that you ought
to think, as a consumer, not

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.480
just about the
total dollars that's

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.040
growing but the purchasing
power of those dollars.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.220
OK.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:19.810
For the purposes of
doing NPV calculations,

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:23.710
I want to just mention
one rule of thumb that

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.500
will do you in good
stead, no matter what kind

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:28.870
of calculations you do.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.050
And that is simply to keep
track of whether you're using

00:41:32.050 --> 00:41:36.880
nominal or real cash flows.

00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:41.180
And then to use nominal or
real discount rates to match.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.910
In other words,
nominal cash flow

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:45.940
should be divided by
nominal discount rates.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.830
And real cash flow should be
denominated by real discount

00:41:50.830 --> 00:41:52.270
rates.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:56.020
Most of the cash flows that you
will get in your analysis will

00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:58.411
typically be nominal.

00:41:58.411 --> 00:42:01.210
Nominal meaning that's the
actual number of dollars

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.700
you will see on those dates.

00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.370
But occasionally, you
may get a forecast

00:42:06.370 --> 00:42:08.510
that is made in real terms--

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:11.704
in terms of purchasing power.

00:42:11.704 --> 00:42:13.120
And in that case,
you have to just

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.830
be careful to use the
right interest rate when

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:16.080
you're doing your discounting.

00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:18.890
You have to take into
account inflation.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.590
Nominal gets discounted by
nominal, real gets discounted

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:23.090
by real.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:27.359
That's all you have
to remember, OK?

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:28.400
Any questions about that?

00:42:31.606 --> 00:42:32.980
OK.

00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:35.320
We're now done with
lecture 3 and we're

00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:38.680
moving on to lecture 4, which
is fixed income securities.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:43.360
And this is the focus of much
of the dislocation in markets

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.260
today.

00:42:44.260 --> 00:42:46.120
So this is very topical.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.010
And something that
I think you'll

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.740
find very useful
when we start trying

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.425
to understand exactly what's
been going on in these markets.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:58.540
Let me start with a little
bit of an industry overview.

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.810
And the industry
overview will give you

00:43:04.810 --> 00:43:09.945
a sense of why these markets
are so important as well as so

00:43:09.945 --> 00:43:10.445
large.

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:14.910
OK.

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:16.690
So we're going to
start, as I said,

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:21.090
with an overview of
markets and participants.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:23.610
And then I'm going to talk
about evaluation of fixed income

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:24.720
securities.

00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.110
It turns out that all of the
hard work that we've done just

00:43:28.110 --> 00:43:30.180
over the last three
lectures are going

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.970
to be able to get us
through all of valuation

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:34.230
for fixed income securities.

00:43:34.230 --> 00:43:36.900
In other words, you
now know all that you

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.560
need to know to price
virtually any fixed income

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.160
security without default.
Without uncertainty.

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.960
Remember, we said no
uncertainty until lecture 12.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.630
It's a pretty significant
accomplishment

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:53.275
because there are lots and
lots of securities out there

00:43:53.275 --> 00:43:54.650
that are fixed
income securities.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.180
And you now have the
tools-- you don't

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:58.054
know that you have the
tools yet, but you do,

00:43:58.054 --> 00:44:00.757
believe me, to price them all.

00:44:00.757 --> 00:44:02.840
So we're going to go over
the valuation principles

00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.355
and apply them to discount
bonds and coupon bonds.

00:44:06.355 --> 00:44:07.730
And then I'm going
to talk to you

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:09.290
a little bit about uncertainty.

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:13.250
I want to bring in interest
rate risk in a very simple way.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:14.900
I want to simply
talk about the fact

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.690
that interest rates
do change over time

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:21.530
and that change can actually
cause some concern as well

00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:22.550
as some opportunities.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.910
I want to discuss what those
opportunities and concerns are.

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:28.474
And then I'm going to conclude
by talking about default.

00:44:28.474 --> 00:44:30.140
I'm going to talk
about corporate bonds.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.350
And I probably won't talk
about the subprime issues

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:37.610
in this class because I want
to focus on the material that's

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:38.580
required.

00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.310
But I will talk about it in this
pro seminar, which is optional.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:43.280
So you're welcome
to come on Wednesday

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:45.854
and we'll go over that material.

00:44:45.854 --> 00:44:48.020
And if you want, you can
take a look at it yourself.

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.950
It's pretty self-explanatory so
I think you'll see how it goes.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:55.470
For readings, I'd like you all
to read chapters 23 through 25

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:56.990
of Brealey, Myers, and Allen.

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:59.540
You'll have three
lectures to do that.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.390
Lectures 4, 5, and 6
will all be focused

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:04.430
on fixed income securities.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:07.550
So let me talk to you a
bit about the industry now.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:11.000
The name fixed income securities
means exactly what it says.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.420
What we're going to do now is
to focus on pieces of paper

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:21.830
where the payoffs are
fixed and known in advance.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.820
Unlike a stock where you buy
a stock and you don't know

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:29.060
whether it's going to pay off
at all and the cash flows,

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:34.400
the dividends or repurchases or
capital gains are uncertain--

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.180
you don't have any idea what the
cash flows may or may not be--

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.140
in contrast of those securities,
fixed income instruments

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:44.810
have fixed incomes.

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:49.850
So they have very, very
clearly stated payoffs

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:51.710
that you know in advance.

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:54.800
So from a pricing
perspective, these

00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.340
are probably the simplest
kind of securities that could

00:45:58.340 --> 00:46:01.580
possibly be constructed, right?

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:04.160
Couldn't be simpler than
a piece of paper that

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:10.190
says every year on this
date, I will pay you $10,000

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.190
of nominal currency, right?

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:15.800
That's a fixed income security.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:21.380
Examples are anything
from treasury securities,

00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:24.290
securities issued by the
United States Treasury

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:29.240
and other foreign treasuries,
to federal agent securities.

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.800
We know about those now, right?

00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.100
Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac securities.

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.790
To corporate
security-- securities

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:37.250
issued not by the government
or by government sponsored

00:46:37.250 --> 00:46:40.220
entities, but by
private corporations

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.930
and public corporations.

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:44.210
And then municipal
securities, these

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:47.370
are securities issued
by local governments.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:51.380
And then mortgage backed
securities, securities

00:46:51.380 --> 00:46:56.340
that are payoffs of pools
of other securities,

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:58.040
including mortgages.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:02.360
And then the whole mix
of collateralized debt

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.800
obligations, collateralized
loan obligations, credit default

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:12.060
swaps, and other
complex instruments.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.850
That's a lot of securities.

00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:20.060
And to get a sense of how many
securities we're talking about.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:22.890
let me show you the market.

00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:25.320
This is as of the end
of 2006 because that's

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:30.370
the only data that I
could get that is timely.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:35.140
At the end of 2006,
the US bond market

00:47:35.140 --> 00:47:41.620
consisted of just tremendous,
tremendous amount of assets.

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:45.400
So $6.4 trillion in
mortgage-related securities,

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.200
24% of the market.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.360
$2.3 trillion in municipals.
$4.2 trillion in treasuries.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.920
$2 trillion in asset
backed securities.

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.660
$3.8 trillion money market.

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.900
$2.6 trillion in federal
agencies, securities,

00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:01.420
and so on.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:05.130
These numbers-- they
dwarf the stock market.

00:48:05.130 --> 00:48:10.440
So we're traditionally
focused in financial analysis

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.500
on pricing stocks
and analyzing stocks.

00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:16.170
And we get all excited
when Google tries

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:20.440
to take over Yahoo and so on.

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:24.310
But the size of the markets,
the size of equity markets

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:28.120
are dwarfed by fixed
income securities.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.260
And again, these are
apples and oranges.

00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:34.180
And I'm just saying that there
is a hell of a lot more apples

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.040
and there are oranges.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:38.530
You can figure out what
you want from that,

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:41.140
but these are
really big markets.

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.080
And on this slide, I
show you the evolution

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.870
of these markets-- how
they've integral over time

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.930
from 1985 to 2006.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:55.360
And what you'll see is that
the mortgage-related market

00:48:55.360 --> 00:49:02.200
has just grown by tremendous,
tremendous amounts.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.450
As well as federal
agency securities--

00:49:04.450 --> 00:49:06.760
that's Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:10.780
And asset backed markets
was nothing in 1985.

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.510
It didn't exist in '85.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:17.500
And now we're talking about
a $2 trillion market here.

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.680
So a lot has happened
in the last 20 years.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:23.990
It's been exciting times
for financial markets.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:25.570
And right now,
we're in the midst

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:31.710
of some market turmoil because
of that unbridled growth.

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:35.920
Now this is the
amount outstanding.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:38.560
This chart shows
you the issuance

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.530
that is the amount of
debt that's being issued

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:42.740
at any given point in time.

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:48.550
So the first was an example
of the stock of debt

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:50.050
at any point in time.

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:56.300
And now, I'm talking about
the flow of debt year by year.

00:49:56.300 --> 00:50:02.080
And you can see that as of
2006, mortgage-related bonds

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:08.050
were the fastest
growing segment, by far.

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.890
And that continued up
until 2007 and then

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:15.710
the brakes started being
put on to that market.

00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:16.810
OK?

00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:20.680
And you can see over
time, the growth

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:23.860
of these various different
markets and the fact

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:26.350
that federal agency
securities grew

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:29.230
but mortgage-related
securities probably

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:34.097
was the fastest growing subject
to the asset backed market

00:50:34.097 --> 00:50:35.180
as well, which is related.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:36.266
Yeah?

00:50:36.266 --> 00:50:38.710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] asset
backed and mortgage-related?

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:40.890
ANDREW LO: Mortgage-related is
specifically about mortgages.

00:50:40.890 --> 00:50:42.370
Asset backed could be any asset.

00:50:42.370 --> 00:50:45.460
So for example, consumer
credit card loans--

00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:49.240
you can package that up
and sell claims on that

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.820
and that would be under
asset backed securities,

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:53.590
not under mortgages.

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:56.630
But they're related, obviously.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:57.740
OK.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:59.510
So these numbers
will give you an idea

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:04.110
of what's out there, what's
significant and what's not.

00:51:04.110 --> 00:51:07.340
This gives you a sense of the
amount of trading that goes on.

00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:15.260
While these securities are
large in size and large in flow,

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.860
they are not that large
in terms of transactions.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:24.720
So unlike stocks that
trade all the time,

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:30.960
we don't have an organized US
bond exchange like the NYSE,

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.810
where people trade bonds
every minute of the day.

00:51:33.810 --> 00:51:37.950
There are bonds being traded
every minute of the day,

00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:40.710
but they aren't
typically the same ones.

00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:43.800
Whereas I would argue
that Microsoft and Google

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:48.120
are traded every minute
of the trading day.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.790
So typically, bonds do
trade, but they don't

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:54.310
trade on organized exchanges.

00:51:54.310 --> 00:51:56.860
And that makes them less liquid.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:03.400
Even the very, very safest
and most liquid bonds

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:08.170
do not trade as frequently
as equities and futures.

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:11.424
So the liquidity characteristics
can be very, very different

00:52:11.424 --> 00:52:12.340
for these instruments.

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:15.820
And these complex securities,
like collateralized debt

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:17.890
obligations, mortgage
backed securities--

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:21.400
they trade even less frequently
because they are highly complex

00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.490
and it's not easy to figure
out what their prices are

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:28.350
from minute to minute every day.

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:31.030
Now the fixed income
market participants

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:35.350
that we're going to be focused
on fall into three groups--

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:40.260
issuers, intermediaries,
and investors.

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:45.300
Issuers, of course, are the
end users of these instruments.

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:48.030
They include everything
from governments

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:51.010
down to foreign institutions.

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:54.840
These are the folks that issue
pieces of paper that are IOUs

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.000
and they get cash
in return for that

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.320
to finance their operations.

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:03.240
And in return, they
pay interest, OK?

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.830
The investors, of
course, are the folks

00:53:05.830 --> 00:53:11.320
that are buying the paper or
essentially providing loans.

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.090
So every once in a
while, when I go out

00:53:13.090 --> 00:53:15.970
with my colleagues for
lunch in the finance group,

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:19.060
one of my colleagues will
say, can I sell you a bond,

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.650
I didn't go to the
cash machine today,

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:23.440
and I need you to help
me finance my lunch.

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:28.720
These are how finance
professors speak, unfortunately.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:32.830
The idea about
buying somebody bond

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:36.070
is you're lending
them money, right?

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:38.870
So instead of saying could
you let me $5, we have to say,

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:41.650
well, I'm going to issue a
bond, can you buy my bond.

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:47.380
The investors are the
ones that are loaning

00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.260
the money to the issuers.

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:50.920
OK?

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.510
And these include, as I said,
governments, pension funds,

00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:58.300
insurance companies, banks,
hedge funds, and so on.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:02.590
In the middle of all of
this are the intermediaries.

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:05.630
Primary dealers, other
kinds of dealers,

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:09.490
investment banks, the
credit rating agencies,

00:54:09.490 --> 00:54:10.840
the credit enhancers.

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:12.520
What do I mean by
credit enhancers?

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.350
Folks that help credit
markets by providing insurance

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:20.470
to the credit, like
private mortgage insurance.

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:21.910
And liquidity enhancers.

00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:23.380
These are the
counter-parties that

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:25.660
try to bring buyers
and sellers together

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.930
to increase the
liquidity of the markets.

00:54:28.930 --> 00:54:33.530
The dislocation has been going
on in the intermediary sector

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:37.250
and of course, the issuers
are having some difficulties

00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:39.290
now because they're going
to have to make good

00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:40.610
on these kind of claims.

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:44.240
And the people that are
going to be hurt ultimately

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:47.630
will be the investors who are
holding pieces of paper that

00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:50.070
may not be worth as
much as possible.

00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:52.670
And so the efforts now
at trying to shore up

00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:56.540
the finances of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, Lehman, Merrill,

00:54:56.540 --> 00:54:59.060
and all of these
other institutions

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.540
is really aimed at
trying to help out

00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:05.240
a combination of the
intermediaries and the issuers.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.850
Because if you don't help out
this group, then what happens

00:55:07.850 --> 00:55:11.120
is that this group
is going to get hit.

00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.430
So Lehman Brothers, for
example, is an intermediary.

00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:16.212
They are one of
the biggest dealers

00:55:16.212 --> 00:55:17.420
in these kinds of securities.

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.330
Merrill Lynch is also one
of the biggest dealers

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:21.530
in these kind of securities.

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:26.930
As dealers, they end up taking
exposure on their own books.

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.050
That's not a great
idea in general

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:33.710
because the best
of all worlds is

00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:36.624
you're the toll collector
that's collecting tolls

00:55:36.624 --> 00:55:38.790
for traffic going back and
forth and back and forth.

00:55:38.790 --> 00:55:40.630
You don't take any risk.

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:43.870
But if not everybody
wants to go back and forth

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:45.910
and back and forth and
back and forth, you

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:49.690
might stand ready to do
one side of the business

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:52.880
and let other folks do the
other side of the business.

00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.170
But if you're not careful
in laying off your exposure

00:55:56.170 --> 00:55:58.810
you can end up getting
hurt pretty badly.

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:02.050
An example of this that happened
in equity markets in 1987

00:56:02.050 --> 00:56:04.010
was when the stock
market crashed.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:07.750
That was a very serious
event on October 19, 1987,

00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:11.560
where in one single day,
the US stock market lost

00:56:11.560 --> 00:56:13.990
approximately 20% of its value.

00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:15.550
In one day.

00:56:15.550 --> 00:56:17.680
Now, that's a
serious dislocation.

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.480
We're going to talk
about that this Friday

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:20.920
when we run this trading game.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.770
I'm going to have all of you
engage in trading over a very

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:24.770
short period of time.

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:27.130
So you're going to be under
tremendous pressure as well.

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.920
You tell me how easy it
is to think on the fly.

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:32.680
What happened that morning
of October 19, 1987,

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.942
is that the specialists,
the dealers, who

00:56:34.942 --> 00:56:36.400
are supposed to be
making markets--

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.140
their job is to
buy when everybody

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:42.120
wants to sell and to sell
when everybody wants to buy.

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:44.670
They got it there in
the morning at 9:30

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:49.120
and were overwhelmed with
everybody wanting to sell.

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.530
So they ended up buying--

00:56:50.530 --> 00:56:51.950
the specialists.

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:52.720
And they bought.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.360
And as they bought, what
happened to the price?

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.170
Kept going down.

00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:58.753
That means more
people wanted to sell.

00:56:58.753 --> 00:56:59.630
So they kept buying.

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:01.770
And as they bought,
what happened?

00:57:01.770 --> 00:57:03.200
Price kept going down.

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:04.820
And it kept going
down all the way.

00:57:04.820 --> 00:57:07.460
So the stuff that they
bought in the morning

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:11.390
was worth 20% less
in the afternoon.

00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:15.710
And these market makers
also used leverage.

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:18.770
So many of their capital
bases were wiped out

00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:22.340
by that 20% decline in a
day because they were just

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.620
doing their job.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:27.630
In fact, there was a story--

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:30.830
the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange was literally packed.

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:33.980
I mean, it was tighter
than a Tokyo subway train

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:35.510
during rush hour, OK?

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:36.180
It was packed.

00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:40.880
I mean literally, you were
elbow to elbow against others.

00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:43.060
Unfortunately, one
of the market makers

00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:47.890
had a heart attack
around 1 or 2 o'clock.

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:53.470
And he wasn't able
to fall to the ground

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:56.980
until the market closed at
four because he was propped up

00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:01.480
by everybody else desperate
to try to transact.

00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:03.550
And he died.

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:10.780
And somebody who was near
him said, you know, look,

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.061
I knew the guy was in trouble.

00:58:12.061 --> 00:58:13.310
But what was I supposed to do.

00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:17.530
I was 100,000 shares long and
I had to unload my portfolio.

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.000
I mean, they were trading.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.540
That's how desperate
it was on that day.

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:28.420
So this kind of intermediation
can be extraordinarily high

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.140
pressure.

00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:32.920
And when you're engaged in
an unwinding of portfolios,

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:34.310
dislocation can occur.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:36.760
So we're seeing that
right now play out.

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:39.296
And it's a little different
because we're dealing

00:58:39.296 --> 00:58:40.420
with fixed income security.

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:42.940
So I'm going to come
back and talk about that.

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:43.660
OK.

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:45.130
That's the background
to what we're

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:47.980
going to study-- these fixed
income markets and fixed income

00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:48.654
instruments.

00:58:48.654 --> 00:58:51.070
I'm going to ask you to read
Brealey and Myers so that you

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:52.945
can get up to speed on
institutional details.

00:58:52.945 --> 00:58:54.520
And there are quite
a few, so I would

00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:56.530
urge you to please
do that reading

00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:59.320
and make sure that you
understand the basic terms

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.970
of these markets.

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:04.600
What I want to talk about,
though, is the framework.

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:08.050
I want to give you a framework
for thinking about evaluating

00:59:08.050 --> 00:59:09.065
fixed income securities.

00:59:09.065 --> 00:59:10.690
And really, as I
said, it's a framework

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:11.606
that you already know.

00:59:11.606 --> 00:59:13.330
You already have
that in your mind.

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:16.900
I've already changed the way you
think about financial markets

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:20.860
by asking you to focus on cash
flows and timing and the time

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:21.590
value of money.

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:24.220
That's all you need in order to
value fixed income securities.

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.680
The rest is just
institutional detail,

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:29.470
which, while very
important, is not something

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:31.570
that we need to
worry about in class.

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:34.240
But I'll leave to
you to focus on.

00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:37.620
So let me give you an example
of valuation and how to do it.

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:38.920
It will be a very short one.

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:41.090
You all know how to do this.

00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:45.630
We've got a sequence of cash
flows for a particular security

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:47.750
that I'm going to call a bond.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.720
And in particular, I'm going
to call this a coupon bond.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.300
Now with a coupon
bond, there are

00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.780
two things you need to know.

00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.020
You need to know
what the coupon is

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.020
and you need to know
the maturity-- how

01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.450
many dates that it pays off.

01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:04.910
One of the institutional
details that you'll need to know

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:09.500
is that coupon bonds
typically pay semiannually.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:12.530
Some coupon bonds can pay
quarterly, but most of them,

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.960
as a matter of convention,
pay semiannually.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.670
But that changes
depending on the market.

01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:18.878
So you'll need to learn a
little bit about those kind

01:00:18.878 --> 01:00:20.246
of conventions.

01:00:20.246 --> 01:00:21.620
I'm not going to
worry about that

01:00:21.620 --> 01:00:23.078
and I'm going to
abstract from that

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:27.590
and simply say that here's a
three year coupon bond that

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:31.740
has a principal of $1,000.

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:35.510
That's the typical
principal or face value

01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:37.400
that a bond comes with.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:40.220
So this piece of
paper is an IOU.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:46.700
And it says, I owe you $1,000
at the end of three years, OK?

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.730
But I'm not going to
pay you just $1,000

01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.110
at the end of three years.

01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:57.330
I'm going to pay you $50 every
year for those three years.

01:00:57.330 --> 01:01:02.910
So the coupon is a 5% coupon.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:07.770
So when you hear of a coupon
bond that's a 5% three year

01:01:07.770 --> 01:01:11.830
bond, that term
that I just uttered

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:17.050
means that it pays off $1,000
at the end of three years.

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:21.609
And in the interim, it pays
off $50 a year as it's coupons.

01:01:21.609 --> 01:01:22.900
Why is it called a coupon bond?

01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:25.840
In the old days, the bond
was actually a piece of paper

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:28.900
and on the bottom of
it were little coupons.

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.630
And you'd clip the
coupons and mail them in.

01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:33.880
And once a year when you
mail them in, or twice a year

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.521
when you mail them
in, you get back $50.

01:01:37.521 --> 01:01:38.020
OK?

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:40.330
Nowadays, it's all
done electronically.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:44.220
So first thing you do in order
to value of the cash flow--

01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.060
draw a time line, OK?

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:48.460
We're here sitting at
zero, that's today.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:50.140
And you've got
three years to go.

01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.240
One year, two year, three years.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.500
At the end of three years,
you get paid your principal--

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.250
$1,000--

01:01:57.250 --> 01:01:58.860
plus the coupon.

01:01:58.860 --> 01:02:01.460
There are three coupons
for three years.

01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:07.170
And so at the end of this
bond, when the bond matures,

01:02:07.170 --> 01:02:09.660
you get paid $1,050.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:13.770
And then $50, $50, and
here we are at date zero.

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:17.040
Question-- what is this worth?

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.435
Yeah?

01:02:18.435 --> 01:02:20.760
AUDIENCE: It depends
on the interest rate.

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.500
ANDREW LO: Right.

01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.648
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] interest
rates are exactly 5%, so it's

01:02:25.648 --> 01:02:27.762
worth just $1000, the same.

01:02:27.762 --> 01:02:28.470
ANDREW LO: Right.

01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:32.700
If the interest rate is 5%,
it's worth $1,000 today.

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:33.810
That's par.

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:37.107
But if the interest rate
is worth less than that--

01:02:37.107 --> 01:02:40.320
AUDIENCE: Worth
more [INAUDIBLE]..

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:41.490
ANDREW LO: Right, exactly.

01:02:41.490 --> 01:02:45.970
So in general, how do you figure
out the price of this thing?

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:47.561
Yeah.

01:02:47.561 --> 01:02:51.489
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
vice versa [INAUDIBLE]??

01:02:56.865 --> 01:02:59.490
ANDREW LO: Well no, I was asking
a somewhat different question,

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:01.948
which is, how do I figure out
the market value of this bond

01:03:01.948 --> 01:03:03.405
today times 0.

01:03:03.405 --> 01:03:05.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:09.110
ANDREW LO: Yeah, compute
the net present value, NPV.

01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:10.560
That's one answer.

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.130
That was the correct
textbook answer.

01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:15.910
What's another answer of how do
I figure out the market value?

01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:16.790
AUDIENCE: Through the market.

01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:17.581
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

01:03:17.581 --> 01:03:18.450
Auction it off.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:21.230
How many people want to pay
me $1,000 for this today?

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:22.630
No? $1,001?

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:23.630
a thousand and whenever.

01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:25.430
We can auction it off
and figure out what

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:27.300
the price is from the market.

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:30.170
But in fact, what
we're doing by doing so

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.760
is computing the present value.

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.070
And the way we're doing
it is by figuring out

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:38.450
what the price of a dollar
is in date one today.

01:03:38.450 --> 01:03:41.420
What the price of a dollar
in year two is today.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:44.420
And what the price of a
dollar is in year three today.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.760
Getting those exchange
rates and then

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.710
converting all of those
different currencies to dollars

01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:52.531
today.

01:03:52.531 --> 01:03:53.030
Right?

01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:56.090
We know this we've
done this many times.

01:03:56.090 --> 01:04:05.400
So the way that you
figure out valuation

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:11.590
is by using discount rates
that we get from the market

01:04:11.590 --> 01:04:14.200
and applying them to compute
present values, right?

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.650
Very simple.

01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:19.420
So really, the components
of evaluation for bonds,

01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:22.130
if there's no uncertainty,
you already know.

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.750
We've done it.

01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:24.610
That was last lecture.

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:30.130
And for special cash flows like
annuities and perpetuities,

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:32.350
we've got closed form solutions.

01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:35.944
Formulas, which you can program
up in Excel to figure out.

01:04:35.944 --> 01:04:37.360
The kind of risks
that we're going

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:42.310
to focus on later on in this
lecture and in the lectures

01:04:42.310 --> 01:04:45.850
after we talk about
uncertainty is inflation risk.

01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:47.230
We talked about that, right?

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:50.110
The fact that when you buy
a bond or you sell a bond,

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:52.180
if the purchasing
power changes, that's

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:55.840
going to introduce a
new kind of unknown

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.460
that we need to grapple with.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:58.610
Credit risk.

01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:00.490
That's a major form
of risk that we're

01:05:00.490 --> 01:05:02.680
dealing with in
financial markets today

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.380
and that we're likely to be
dealing with for years to come.

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:10.100
You might like to borrow
from me or lend to me,

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.500
but what about credit issues.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:14.000
How do you know
that I'm still going

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:17.900
to be around a year from
now, two years from now.

01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:20.960
Timing, which we'll come back
to a little bit later on.

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.920
Liquidity.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.480
And then of course,
what currency.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.230
If we're doing
international borrowing,

01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:28.790
we have an extra dimension of
risk, which is fluctuations

01:05:28.790 --> 01:05:30.830
in the exchange rate, OK?

01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:33.980
So for the next
couple of lectures,

01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.760
I want to keep life simple and
talk just about riskless debt.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.330
Riskless in terms of
default. So in particular I'm

01:05:41.330 --> 01:05:44.610
going to be talking about
US government bonds.

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:45.380
All right?

01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.120
And I'll come back
to risky debt later.

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.050
But for now, let's just focus
on the debt that will not

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:54.500
default because you can always
print up dollars to pay off

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.180
your creditors, right?

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.800
Those dollars may
not be worth as much

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.590
as you would like them to be
if you do too much of that,

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:04.980
but for now, we're not
going to focus on default.

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:08.980
OK so the first kind
of bond that we're

01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:13.870
going to try to price is what's
called a pure discount bond.

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:16.780
This is a bond that is different
from a coupon bond in the sense

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:18.190
that there are no coupons.

01:06:18.190 --> 01:06:23.530
So it only pays off
one payment at the end.

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:25.410
And the reason it's
called the discount bond

01:06:25.410 --> 01:06:28.170
is because it is
what it sounds like--

01:06:28.170 --> 01:06:32.160
the price of the bond today
is going to be at a discount

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.050
from the face value.

01:06:34.050 --> 01:06:37.980
If the face value is $1,000
and there's nothing in between,

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:41.640
then the price of the banters
can't be greater than $1,000

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:46.240
because money today is worth
more than money next year.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:49.410
So the price today is going
to be lower than $1,000.

01:06:49.410 --> 01:06:52.380
It's going to be a
discount over $1,000, hence

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:54.150
the term pure discount bond.

01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:56.850
Now there are pure
discount bonds out there.

01:06:56.850 --> 01:07:00.120
US treasury bills
are examples, where

01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.450
there's one payoff at the
end and nothing in between.

01:07:03.450 --> 01:07:07.140
But awhile ago,
financial engineers

01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.994
came up with a rather
brilliant idea,

01:07:08.994 --> 01:07:11.160
which you may not think is
so brilliant because it's

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.870
so painfully obvious.

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:15.760
The government issues
coupon bonds as well.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.790
And typically, for
longer maturities,

01:07:17.790 --> 01:07:21.780
like five years,
15 and 30 years,

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.980
there are no pure discount bonds
for those longer maturities.

01:07:25.980 --> 01:07:30.279
When the government issues them,
they issue them with coupons.

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.820
But you can imagine
a situation where

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:36.990
somebody would like to have
a discount bond for 30 years.

01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:38.910
And so some clever
financial engineer said,

01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:41.090
hey, here's what
I'm going to do.

01:07:41.090 --> 01:07:46.070
I'm going to buy up a lot of
these treasury coupon bonds

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:50.480
and I'm going to issue
discount bonds that

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:55.430
match exactly the coupon
payments from my treasury

01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:56.240
bonds.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.190
In other words, I'm
going to take the coupons

01:07:58.190 --> 01:08:03.840
and strip them and offer them
up as separate securities.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:08.070
And I'm going to
call these STRIPS.

01:08:08.070 --> 01:08:11.910
And these STRIPS, which
stands for separate trading

01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:15.600
of registered interest
and principal securities,

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:20.100
created a huge market
for essentially

01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:23.040
what are government
bonds, but that

01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.790
have been pre-processed in
a relatively simple way.

01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:29.500
Now, this didn't
happen that long ago.

01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:32.550
Maybe, I don't know, 15 or 20
years ago they created STRIPS.

01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:35.146
So this is why I'm so excited
about financial markets

01:08:35.146 --> 01:08:37.520
and why I think all of you
have tremendous opportunities.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:40.500
It's because there
are so many ideas that

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:44.640
may seem obvious to you but
are not obvious to the market.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.910
And there's no
patent on good ideas.

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:49.830
There's no monopoly
on good ideas.

01:08:49.830 --> 01:08:52.920
You can actually
create tremendous value

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:54.660
by coming up with
what you might think

01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:56.970
of as so simple a
solution but that

01:08:56.970 --> 01:09:01.220
solves problems for very
large financial institutions.

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:02.630
Now how do we
price these things.

01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:05.569
Well, this is just a one liner.

01:09:05.569 --> 01:09:08.600
The price of a
discount on is simply

01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.270
equal to its face
value discounted

01:09:11.270 --> 01:09:15.529
to the present by the
appropriate interest rate.

01:09:15.529 --> 01:09:16.670
That's it.

01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:17.740
Pure and simple.

01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:21.430
We're now done with pricing
pure discount bonds.

01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:23.800
There's nothing else to it.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.720
OK.

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.290
It turns out that this is a
really wonderful relationship

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:32.830
because if you've got two
of these three variables

01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:36.189
in this equation,
you've got the third.

01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:38.260
If I tell you what
the face value is

01:09:38.260 --> 01:09:40.580
and what the interest rate
is, you've got the price.

01:09:40.580 --> 01:09:43.122
If I tell you what the price
is and what the face value is,

01:09:43.122 --> 01:09:44.330
you've got the interest rate.

01:09:44.330 --> 01:09:46.960
And if I give you the
interest rate of the price,

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.229
you can actually figure out what
the face value is, all right?

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:52.779
So this relationship is
going to be very handy when

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:55.150
we look at the prices
of these instruments

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:59.710
and we want to now infer
what that says about what's

01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:01.420
going on with interest rates.

01:10:01.420 --> 01:10:04.150
In fact, what I'm going to
show you next time is that when

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:06.190
we look at the
newspaper and we take

01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:10.210
a look at the prices of
discounted coupon bonds,

01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:14.755
implicit in those prices is
a forecast of the future.

01:10:14.755 --> 01:10:16.380
This is as close as
any of you are ever

01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:18.270
going to get to a crystal ball.

01:10:18.270 --> 01:10:19.170
I'm serious.

01:10:19.170 --> 01:10:21.970
By looking at prices,
you can tell the future.

01:10:21.970 --> 01:10:24.570
You can't do it
perfectly, but neither

01:10:24.570 --> 01:10:27.720
can Jean Dixon or any of the
other astrologers, right?

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:31.680
The point is that this is
our way of figuring out

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.500
the collective intelligence
of all market participants

01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:38.040
and what they think of
what was going to happen.

01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:43.980
And because of that, because of
that kind of market knowledge,

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:46.980
I can tell you that
with 99.5% confidence,

01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.500
tomorrow, the Fed will
cut its interest rate.

01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:50.790
Now how do I know that.

01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:51.840
I don't know that.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.460
The Fed may not.

01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:55.309
But if you look at
financial markets today,

01:10:55.309 --> 01:10:56.850
if you look at
treasury prices today,

01:10:56.850 --> 01:11:00.980
if you look at the Fed funds
features, all of those prices--

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.710
if you know how to read that,
if you can decipher those tea

01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:05.120
leaves--

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:07.500
it will tell you that tomorrow,
the Fed will cut rates.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:10.450
So I want you to watch tomorrow
to see if I'm right, OK?

01:11:10.450 --> 01:11:14.360
It would be very embarrassing
and potentially catastrophic

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.280
if I'm wrong.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:19.120
So listen carefully.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.344
Any questions?

01:11:21.344 --> 01:11:22.820
Yeah.

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.296
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:30.741 --> 01:11:31.740
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:34.140
In other words, if they
cut rates tomorrow,

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:36.390
then they're going
to be shooting

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:39.840
one of the very few remaining
bullets that they have.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.172
The question is, if a
bear is charging at you

01:11:42.172 --> 01:11:44.130
and you've got one bullet
left, you're probably

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:45.840
going to use it anyway, right?

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.340
So why don't we return to
this issue on Wednesday

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.340
since we're out of time?

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.290
All right, thank you.

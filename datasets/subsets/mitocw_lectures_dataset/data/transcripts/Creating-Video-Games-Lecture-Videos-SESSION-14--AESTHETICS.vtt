00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.600
PROFESSOR: OK, so a couple
really quick announcements--

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.682
on Monday, I mentioned a
number of other classes

00:00:34.682 --> 00:00:37.140
that are offered in the spring
if you're interested in game

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.350
development here at MIT.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.930
But I forgot this one.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.340
This is 11.127.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.880
It's also cross-listed
as CMS.590.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.410
It's taught by Eric Klopfer
and Scott Osterweil.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.730
Scott should be in
our class next Monday,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.120
I believe, to talk to
us about learning games.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.730
But if you end up
being interested

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.520
in games for learning,
games for education,

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.890
this is a great class to take.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.269
And it's offered in the spring.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.430
We also have a class, CMS.615,
Games for Social Change,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.240
that's being taught this fall.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.140
So if the topics of the
games that we're working on

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.930
for Project 4 are
something that you just

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.429
find yourself really interested
in in the next couple years,

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:22.470
those are two classes you can
take to explore that further.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.360
PHILIP TAN: All right,
so I guess for me, it's

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.584
talking for an hour, and then
after that, teamwork, right?

00:01:28.584 --> 00:01:29.500
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.300
PHILIP TAN: OK, so today,
what we're going to do

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.860
is talk a little bit about
aesthetics, about what we

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.630
mean when we say
we want your game

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.450
to have a cohesive aesthetic.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.130
We do realize that the games
that we're asking you to make

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.340
are extremely time constrained.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.800
We've been asking you not to go
terribly much beyond the scope

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.270
of what you've done before.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.500
But what we want
to see in your game

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.400
is a really, really
cohesive aesthetic.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.310
We used to tell
students that we wanted

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.640
them to put out polished games.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.080
But there was a really
unclear definition

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.350
when we used to do this about
what a polished game would be.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.790
And we also realized
that for some students,

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.200
for a lot of you, you've seen
games that are really, really,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.100
really polished.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.160
When I say a polished
game, can you

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.410
come up with some
examples of things

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.803
that immediately come to mind?

00:02:24.803 --> 00:02:25.670
STUDENT: Limbo.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.420
PHILIP TAN: Limbo?

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.000
Yeah, that's the
black and white side

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.600
scrolling platform, really,
really spooky, gorgeous visuals

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.890
and sound design.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.520
What else?

00:02:37.884 --> 00:02:38.384
Yeah.

00:02:38.384 --> 00:02:40.249
STUDENT: All of the
Final Fantasy games

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:41.290
have really polished UIs.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.810
PHILIP TAN: Pretty much, yeah.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.250
Every single Final
Fantasy game for its era

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.890
is probably like the high
watermark for production

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.870
values-- not just the UI.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.820
But you're right in
saying the UI is alive.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.390
Whenever you even switch
to a different menu option,

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.688
it does this little animation.

00:02:57.688 --> 00:02:59.604
STUDENT: It's one of the
only [INAUDIBLE] that

00:02:59.604 --> 00:03:00.771
has a really good UI design.

00:03:00.771 --> 00:03:02.229
And I've looked at
a bunch of them.

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.452
And it's like, Final
Fantasy is just way

00:03:04.452 --> 00:03:05.635
better than all that stuff.

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:06.110
And of course,
the graphics, too.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.276
PHILIP TAN: Which is amazing,
because they change it

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:09.526
so much every game.

00:03:09.526 --> 00:03:10.900
Unlike a lot of
other franchises,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.110
they change the formula
a lot, but also of course

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.120
other things, like
the animation quality

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.430
and the music and
the voice act--

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.486
maybe not the voice acting.

00:03:20.486 --> 00:03:20.986
Yeah.

00:03:20.986 --> 00:03:22.410
STUDENT: Meat Boy.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.535
PHILIP TAN: Super Meat Boy?

00:03:23.535 --> 00:03:24.865
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:26.780
[INAUDIBLE] physics.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.470
PHILIP TAN: Yeah, for folks
who haven't played this game,

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.050
it's a really punishing game.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:34.980
But it makes it super
easy for you to try again.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.410
In fact, there's like a
single frame between you dying

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.430
and you starting the game again.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.440
And it goes right off.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.040
A game built by two people, by
the way-- it's an indie game.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.990
You can see it in documentaries
like Indie Game-- The Movie.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.970
And you can see even though
they're working on their own--

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.950
and they do spend a
considerable amount of time

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.670
on an extremely visually
polished and musically amazing

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:59.697
game as well.

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:00.980
STUDENT: Monument Valley

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.080
PHILIP TAN: Monument
Valley for the iOS?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.460
Yeah, I can't remember, has
it come out for Android yet?

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.410
But it's definitely
iOS right now.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.204
But what strikes
you as polished?

00:04:11.204 --> 00:04:16.180
STUDENT: The graphics and the
gameplay is just very smooth.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.680
PHILIP TAN: Mhm,
and the game's kind

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.664
of like a flat shaded
isometric game,

00:04:21.664 --> 00:04:23.590
if you're familiar
with that 3D concept.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.190
It means that things
that are far away

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.315
are the same size as things
that are close to you--

00:04:27.315 --> 00:04:31.140
isometric orthogonal projection.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.870
The camera is kind of looking at
the world at a 45 degree angle

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.999
up and sideways.

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:40.540
Everything's flat shaded, but
it's got incredible art design.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.000
It's got art direction,
I would say, just

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.570
how all of the characters,
even though they basically all

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.150
have one color, maybe
black and white,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.300
move with a lot
of expressiveness.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.000
They have iconic characters,
and you immediately

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.400
sort of recognize what each
character is supposed to be,

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.233
even though the game
is pretty much made out

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:02.760
of geometric shapes.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.330
I call out Hearthstone.

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.310
Anyone playing that?

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.820
Anyone else?

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.160
Yeah, it's like just every
little bit of movement

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.870
that the screen does as
soon as your finger touches

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.650
that screen is amazing.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.580
Even little silly
things, like when

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.400
you are looking for
a match, and you

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.540
see all the other
people who you could

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.000
have been matched against.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.830
And it of course always selects
the perfect match for you.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.370
It's a ridiculous
little UI thing.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.870
But it sort of gets
you in the mood.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.620
And of course, that's
like music and stuff

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.670
for what's really a card game,
a collectible card game, right?

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.140
So what I'd like to do right
now is play through a game

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.910
that I feel has a
coherent aesthetic.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.570
But maybe you wouldn't
necessarily call it polished.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.310
But it gets you a
little bit closer

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.187
to what we're looking at.

00:05:49.187 --> 00:05:51.770
Because it might be a little bit
more feasible for this class.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.440
So who hasn't played Sissy's
Magical Ponycorn Adventure yet?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.460
Who would like to, actually?

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.260
All the hands went up.

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.610
Come on down, yeah, you, yeah.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.716
OK.

00:06:08.716 --> 00:06:12.160
SISSY: Sissy's Magical
Ponycorn Adventure.

00:06:14.888 --> 00:06:16.096
PHILIP TAN: Is that too loud?

00:06:16.096 --> 00:06:18.560
Is that OK?

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.026
SISSY: Hi, my name is Sissy.

00:06:20.026 --> 00:06:22.750
And I simply love ponycorns.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:24.746
It is the best
thing in the world,

00:06:24.746 --> 00:06:26.742
because it's a pony and unicorn.

00:06:26.742 --> 00:06:29.237
It's a ponycorn.

00:06:29.237 --> 00:06:32.417
I don't have any
ponycorns right now,

00:06:32.417 --> 00:06:34.413
so I'm going to go get some.

00:06:34.413 --> 00:06:38.405
Come with me on my magical
ponycorn adventure.

00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:44.892
I can go through rainbows
to visit new places.

00:06:44.892 --> 00:06:49.383
That's not a ponycorn. it's a
goat on a pole. [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:56.369 --> 00:06:59.363
Hi, Orange Boy,
my name is Sissy.

00:06:59.363 --> 00:07:00.860
ORANGE BOY: [GIBBERISH]

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.856
SISSY: Do you like ponycorns?

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:03.854
ORANGE BOY: [GIBBERISH]

00:07:03.854 --> 00:07:04.852
SISSY: Me too.

00:07:04.852 --> 00:07:06.349
Got any jars?

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:07.347
ORANGE BOY: [GIBBERISH]

00:07:07.347 --> 00:07:07.930
SISSY: Thanks.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.337
If I find any ponycorns,
I'll put them in these jars.

00:07:12.337 --> 00:07:15.830
This is an empty jar
for holding ponycorns.

00:07:19.822 --> 00:07:21.319
I see a new rainbow.

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:30.301
EVIL LEMON: [CACKLING]
I'm an evil lemon.

00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:31.798
SISSY: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:31.798 --> 00:07:34.542
EVIL LEMON: I will squirt
lemon juice in your eyes,

00:07:34.542 --> 00:07:36.289
and that stings.

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:39.642
SISSY: Oh no, what will I do?

00:07:39.642 --> 00:07:41.450
EVIL LEMON: Stay away.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.390
SISSY: [SCREAMS]

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.640
EVIL LEMON: Stay away.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.930
SISSY: [SCREAMS] I found a key.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.888
Hmm, this [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:06.734 --> 00:08:10.678
TIGER: Hi, I am a tiger,
and I'm going to eat you.

00:08:10.678 --> 00:08:11.664
SISSY: No you're not.

00:08:11.664 --> 00:08:12.650
TIGER: Yes I am.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.622
SISSY: No you're not.

00:08:14.622 --> 00:08:16.101
TIGER: Yes I am.

00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:19.580
SISSY: [SCREAMS]

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.222
TIGER: I'm going to
eat that ponycorn.

00:08:24.708 --> 00:08:26.100
SISSY: I got a coconut.

00:08:33.452 --> 00:08:36.404
It's a coconut.

00:08:36.404 --> 00:08:39.848
I'm going to throw this
coconut at you, lemon.

00:08:39.848 --> 00:08:40.832
EVIL LEMON: Oh no.

00:08:40.832 --> 00:08:41.816
Ow, my face.

00:08:41.816 --> 00:08:46.244
SISSY: That's what you get
for being evil and a lemon.

00:08:46.244 --> 00:08:48.704
EVIL LEMON: Stay away.

00:08:48.704 --> 00:08:49.710
SISSY: [SCREAMS]

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.640
PHILIP TAN: Oh, I think you
might have broken the game,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:54.667
but that's cool.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:55.750
STUDENT: What about a jar?

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.350
PHILIP TAN: Oh, jar, yeah, try.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:59.302
SISSY: This is an empty jar.

00:08:59.302 --> 00:09:01.254
I got the green ponycorn.

00:09:01.254 --> 00:09:02.844
I put it in the jar.

00:09:02.844 --> 00:09:04.760
PHILIP TAN: OK, all
right, so I think everyone

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.843
gets the idea of the game.

00:09:05.843 --> 00:09:07.270
Thank you so much.

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.015
Yay, thank you.

00:09:09.015 --> 00:09:14.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:17.025
So let me actually switch
to my presentation.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.836
There we go.

00:09:21.836 --> 00:09:25.010
I'm going to talk a little
bit about aesthetics.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:32.820
Now, what about that
game seemed off?

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:36.430
Let's start with, what in
the game seems out of place?

00:09:42.456 --> 00:09:43.860
STUDENT: The artwork, I guess?

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.651
PHILIP TAN: The artwork
seems out of place?

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.030
Out of place
compared to the-- it

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.590
is a bit of a trick question.

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.250
I have trouble figuring
out what's out of place.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.040
I think maybe the
cursor hand actually

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.580
looks like this default
kind of browser cursor hand,

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.740
is the one thing that
I feel is not really

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.590
cohesive of everything else.

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.387
The artwork kind
of sets the tone,

00:10:11.387 --> 00:10:13.220
is pretty much the first
thing that you see.

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.844
Even before you start
playing the game,

00:10:14.844 --> 00:10:19.497
you see the artwork
and the website.

00:10:19.497 --> 00:10:21.330
And then of course,
when the music comes on,

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.560
you actually hear pretty
much the girl's voice

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.520
for most of the game.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:31.110
You get to about
halfway through the game

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.880
before you hear a
dad's voice playing

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:39.312
the lemon and Orange Boy, I
guess-- wah, wah, wah, wah.

00:10:39.312 --> 00:10:41.110
Did anyone notice
the user interface?

00:10:44.877 --> 00:10:48.083
STUDENT: It's not obvious at
first what's clickable and what

00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:50.100
isn't.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:53.250
An outline could maybe
help or something

00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:55.710
when you hover over something
that you can actually click.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.680
PHILIP TAN: What are any visual
cues that you were working off

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:01.846
to figure out what to click on?

00:11:01.846 --> 00:11:05.758
STUDENT: Things would be drawn
on different pieces of paper.

00:11:05.758 --> 00:11:08.203
That wasn't clear.

00:11:08.203 --> 00:11:11.137
But in general,
clicking on everything

00:11:11.137 --> 00:11:14.550
is just what I do normally
in point and click games.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:16.050
PHILIP TAN: It is
a click everything

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.040
in the game kind of game.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.450
So that makes sense.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.560
There is actually
a slight little bit

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.730
of drop shadow behind
everything that you can click.

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.770
And some things that
you can click but

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:32.180
don't do anything, like the
goat on the stick, for instance.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:34.160
I thought I saw
another hand over here

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.007
about the user interface.

00:11:36.007 --> 00:11:36.875
Anyone?

00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:38.750
STUDENT: I was going to
say the drop shadows.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.540
PHILIP TAN: Yeah, OK,
the drop shadows, yeah.

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.040
Yeah.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.477
STUDENT: I don't
think there's always

00:11:43.477 --> 00:11:45.393
a drop shadow between
everything you can click on.

00:11:45.393 --> 00:11:46.830
Because I'm pretty sure you
can click on the cactus,

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.539
and the cactus has
no drop shadow.

00:11:48.539 --> 00:11:49.330
PHILIP TAN: Oh, OK.

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:51.180
STUDENT: She's like, ow, cactus.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.620
And I was like,
oh, that's weird.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.060
That didn't give
me any indication

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.460
that collecting it would
give some sort of feedback.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.025
PHILIP TAN: I forget, does
the cactus do anything?

00:11:59.025 --> 00:11:59.650
STUDENT: Uh-uh.

00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:01.873
PHILIP TAN: Ah, so I think
there is a big difference, then.

00:12:01.873 --> 00:12:02.680
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] cactus.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.138
PHILIP TAN: Yeah,
everything that's

00:12:04.138 --> 00:12:07.410
like crucial to advance
in the game I notice

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:09.670
has a drop shadow.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:11.730
But yeah, if you
click everywhere

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.580
in the world-- if it looks like
something that might stand out

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.650
from the blank sheet of paper,
it should respond, right?

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.360
So even though the
cactus is not sort

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:26.385
of a crucial piece of
the plot, such as it is,

00:12:26.385 --> 00:12:29.200
it is something that a
player might reasonably

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.460
expect to be able to
click on and do something.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.105
And yeah, you get pricked by it.

00:12:33.105 --> 00:12:34.309
She says, ow.

00:12:34.309 --> 00:12:35.100
There's some voice.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.770
And there's a little
bit of payoff on that.

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.300
Every time he clicks, there's
a little blue crayon circle

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.770
that sort of emanates from
where you're clicking.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:50.040
So there's another little
typical UI feedback

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.810
of, all right, you
clicked on this thing,

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.260
and we're acknowledging
your mouse click,

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.635
but we're going
to do it in a way

00:12:54.635 --> 00:12:57.718
that sort of works with
the rest of the art style.

00:12:57.718 --> 00:13:00.640
I think something else that
also stands out a little bit

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.940
is-- let me see.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.330
If I go back to the game--
oh, I closed it, didn't I?

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:07.780
OK, all right, does
anyone remember

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.419
if the border between the
game space and the inventory,

00:13:12.419 --> 00:13:13.960
was that like a
straight line, or was

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.090
that kind of a raggedy thing?

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:20.180
I thing it's pure
straight line, right?

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.330
Yeah, so that's
another weird thing.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.280
It's like, this is a
game that's made out

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:25.630
of like ripped sheets of paper.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.760
Then all of a sudden,
there's this hard white line

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.680
right across.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.860
What works in this game?

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.630
Why would someone
want to play this

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.671
to the end-- which just
takes about five minutes.

00:13:36.671 --> 00:13:37.668
It's not terribly long.

00:13:41.652 --> 00:13:43.644
STUDENT: It's sort
of all whimsical.

00:13:43.644 --> 00:13:47.130
And you kind of want to find
out what this girl came up with,

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:52.110
and what they worked together
to create, basically.

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:55.120
The story behind the creation
of the game is also interesting.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.110
PHILIP TAN: Yeah,
it's father/daughter,

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.970
but the daughter led the
project, basically determined

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:03.730
how everything
was going to work.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:06.210
The dad just did the
coding and some voices,

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.440
of course scanning,
and things like that.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.280
But very quickly,
you're introduced things

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.890
like the goat on the stick.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.670
Very, very quickly, it just
establishes that you're just

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:19.800
playing in five-year-old
logic right now,

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.780
and this whole world is
going to work that way.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.290
The fact that it's
narrated largely

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:30.140
by this character-- who has an
opening cut scene, actually.

00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:34.290
It's just like, I'm Sissy,
and I fricking love ponycorns,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.540
and then explains
what a ponycorn is.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.040
And then you don't actually
get to see one until pretty far

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.420
into the game.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.410
But as soon as you're told,
yes, that lump of green

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.930
is a ponycorn, is a pony
with a unicorn horn,

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.150
you then say, OK, all
right, that's a ponycorn.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.150
That's something I want.

00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:55.130
And at that point
in time, you already

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:58.800
know you're supposed
to put them in jars.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:06.960
So that starts to
talk about something

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.940
that we've already been
exploring a lot in this class.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:13.225
It's kind of like the
systemic aesthetic, how

00:15:13.225 --> 00:15:17.020
a person feels when they're
playing through a set of rules.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.380
And Sissy's Magical
Ponycorn Adventure,

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.150
it's the set of rules as
devised by a five-year-old.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.529
But they're actually all
internally consistent.

00:15:24.529 --> 00:15:26.070
When you play through
the whole game,

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:27.939
you start to figure
out, yeah, clicking

00:15:27.939 --> 00:15:30.230
everywhere is actually a
perfectly reasonable strategy.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:32.784
Because nothing's really going
to hurt you in this game.

00:15:32.784 --> 00:15:34.047
You may get scared.

00:15:34.047 --> 00:15:35.380
You may get pricked by a cactus.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.440
But nothing's really
going to hurt you.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.790
So it's OK to click
on everything.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.030
And the kinds of decisions
that you get to make

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.740
are more like, is
now the right time

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:46.167
to use to jar on a ponycorn?

00:15:46.167 --> 00:15:47.750
Do I need to do
something first to get

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:53.280
past the lemon or the other
bad folks who get in your way?

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.470
And the kinds of
rules and strategies

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:59.019
that you have to devise
to be able to navigate

00:15:59.019 --> 00:16:00.810
through your space
gives you a certain kind

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:02.000
of systemic aesthetic.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.570
And you've been working with
that since the beginning

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.570
of the semester.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.810
Prototyping-- some of
you have made games

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:10.450
that make you feel very tense.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:13.930
Some of the games
are more zen-like.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.640
Some games are more strategic.

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.400
And you have to
really think carefully

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.000
about your next decision.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.800
And some of them
are kind of frantic.

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.550
And those have all
come out from the rules

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:25.360
that you devised first
on your prototypes.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.510
And then you moved them over
to your digital versions.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:31.291
And that's one
form of aesthetic.

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:33.335
But then there's also the
other kind of aesthetic

00:16:33.335 --> 00:16:35.710
that we've been talking a
little bit when we talked about

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:40.870
polish-- the art
direction, the music, how

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.510
a 3D object is
rendered, or even how

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:45.830
a 2D graphic is represented.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:50.040
Is it drawn in crayon, or
is it high quality line art,

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.190
or is it something running
in the Crytek engine,

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:58.320
and you've got mobile
mapping and specular lighting

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.354
and things look like fire
and glass and concrete?

00:17:02.354 --> 00:17:04.270
Do the sound effects
sound like they're coming

00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:05.490
from a place in the world?

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:07.990
Do they sound like the thing
they're supposed to sound like?

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.950
Do they sound other worldly
or little MIDI notes,

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:15.995
the sort of thing that you would
expect from a Nintendo game,

00:17:15.995 --> 00:17:17.369
from an old school
Nintendo game?

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:23.960
And then there's the things
that we would normally

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.800
refer to as sort of
the story of the game.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.100
There's the plot of what happens
to characters as they navigate

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.890
through the world, and who are
these characters, who are they

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.510
really, and what sort of
emotional development they're

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.270
going to go through.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:41.560
What's the theme of the game?

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:50.940
Is it a game about being
isolated from everybody else?

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:56.430
Is it a game about
US military strength?

00:17:56.430 --> 00:17:58.780
I think the theme of
Call of Duty is actually,

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.070
America starts wars,
England finishes them,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.540
which is kind of weird
if you look at history.

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:08.090
And where is this game set?

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.230
When is this game set?

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.700
Hopefully that's clear enough.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:19.194
And I think one of the
things that can help

00:18:19.194 --> 00:18:20.610
is just a little
bit of vocabulary

00:18:20.610 --> 00:18:25.190
so that when you're talking
in your team about what's

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.430
working in your
aesthetic, it helps

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:30.220
to be able to put words to it
so that people can understand

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.439
what part of the aesthetic
that you're talking about.

00:18:32.439 --> 00:18:33.980
Are you talking
about the things that

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.530
have to do with a game
system, your rules

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:38.470
and the logic of your game?

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.450
And how is that going to make
someone feel while they're

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.590
playing your game?

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.560
Are you talking about
the style, the musical

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.480
and the visual style of your
game and how things move,

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:54.210
how things animate, and
how things [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:55.690
the things you hear?

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.060
Or are you talking more about
the fictional elements--

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.820
what's going on in
the sort of storyline?

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.950
All these three things
are going to work together

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:06.010
to create the
aesthetic of your game.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:08.590
And all these things
need to work together

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:10.010
for your final project.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.400
So I want you to be
thinking very, very

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:19.380
hard about what's the fiction of
the games that you're creating.

00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.960
Is it being set in a real world
actual city, an actual named

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.460
city?

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:28.750
Is it kind of like an
abstraction of a city

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.271
in a certain part of the world?

00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:31.270
Is it not a city at all?

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.090
Maybe you're playing
as the whole world?

00:19:33.090 --> 00:19:36.110
Maybe you're playing as a
completely different planet,

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:40.690
and you're trying to get
through your learning that way.

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:41.810
Is it about a family?

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.350
Is it about an individual?

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.630
Is it about an entire town
council or something like that?

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:52.800
Style is something that you
have to leverage in order

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.647
to take advantage of
whatever strengths

00:19:54.647 --> 00:19:55.980
you happen to have in your team.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:59.400
If you have really good artists
or a really good musician,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.250
you're going to take
advantage of that.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.010
But you don't want
to do anything that's

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:06.000
going to sort of show
the assets that you

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.040
don't have a lot of
control over as being poor.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:16.600
You want everything to be kind
of a matching even standard.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:24.880
So for instance, if you did a
game that has mostly pixelated

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.320
8-bit style graphics,
and all of a sudden,

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.390
this vector art shape
comes in, you better

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:33.866
have a really good reason
for that thing to be there,

00:20:33.866 --> 00:20:36.620
or a photograph shows up in your
game or something like that.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.660
You better have a
really good reason

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:43.920
why you're throwing in two very,
very different visual styles

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.480
in there.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.640
You can make it work.

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.991
But you need to be able to
think very, very hard about how

00:20:48.991 --> 00:20:51.240
you're going to make that
work-- even things like what

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.912
your cursor is going to be.

00:20:52.912 --> 00:20:55.440
And of course, how's that
going to work with your system,

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:55.940
right?

00:20:55.940 --> 00:21:01.820
If your game is about a dire
situation-- floods are coming

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:04.460
in or something,
there's an epidemic--

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:09.300
and you put everything in
kind of nice, sunny, tropical,

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:12.620
everyone's at a beach
kind of a setting,

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.950
well, you can sort of do this
like weird subversive thing.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:18.136
But then you have to be
very, very conscious.

00:21:18.136 --> 00:21:19.760
It might be a little
bit easier for you

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:22.010
to just use a
visual that actually

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.950
supports the kind of game play
that your game actually has.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.550
If the game is
about feeling tense,

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.250
use visuals that
also communicate

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:32.500
this sense of feeling tense.

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.400
There are games like-- how many
of you have played Tropical?

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.500
A couple of hands out there.

00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:40.770
How about SimCity?

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.460
Who's played SimCity?

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.372
OK, a few more hands.

00:21:43.372 --> 00:21:45.580
So what's the difference
between Tropical and SimCity

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.610
from someone who's
played Tropical?

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:49.127
Yeah.

00:21:49.127 --> 00:21:50.960
STUDENT: The flavor is
completely different.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.322
PHILIP TAN: The what?

00:21:52.322 --> 00:21:55.195
STUDENT: The flavor.

00:21:55.195 --> 00:22:02.955
Tropical is overall kind of
various Caribbean [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:06.550 --> 00:22:12.150
PHILIP TAN: There's a tropical
sort of equatorial setting,

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:18.450
as opposed to SimCity, which is
this very, very urban probably

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:22.460
temperate climate.

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:24.270
In one game, you're the mayor.

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.620
In another game, you're
set up as a dictator.

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:29.790
And the kinds of things
that you do in Tropical

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.200
are supposedly things that
are very similar to SimCity,

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.460
like building and zoning
and constructing up

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:38.960
your little island.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:44.234
But at the same time, you also
have to do sort of dictatorial

00:22:44.234 --> 00:22:46.900
quashing your resistance kind of
things, which you don't usually

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.560
do in SimCity.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.790
But it's set in this
kind of very idyllic

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:55.010
tropical sunny environment.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.800
And developers of
that game are usually

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.010
trying to play that for laughs.

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:03.110
It's like, yeah,
you're a dictator.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.911
But you're not really
that evil compared

00:23:05.911 --> 00:23:07.660
to some of the real
atrocities that you've

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:13.330
seen in tropical dictatorships
in the real world.

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:16.540
And so they're trying to use
the visuals to get across

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:18.400
that you're kind of
this comic dictator.

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:22.930
I can certainly
imagine a game that's

00:23:22.930 --> 00:23:30.690
a lot more about real dictators
of small island nations.

00:23:30.690 --> 00:23:34.610
And that will probably
be a lot more--

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.140
the visuals will probably
not be quite so cheery.

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.680
Even though it
might be sunny, it

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.880
will probably show
a little bit more

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:47.480
of the grit of what it's like
to live in a very humid and very

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.985
muggy and rainy place,
and try to play that

00:23:50.985 --> 00:23:53.610
up so that that aesthetic works
with how the game play actually

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.230
is going to work.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:24:00.930
So I should expand on that.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:04.360
So we talked a
little bit about how

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:10.580
these things work on their own--
fiction, system, and style.

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:14.540
But in between, there
are sort of these domains

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.730
of game development,
which are going

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:18.480
to draw from both of them.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:22.950
How a player interacts with the
system and the visual feedback

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:25.650
they're going to get from
that in the user interface

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.450
is going to also affect how
they feel about your game.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:32.710
And it's going to
affect that aesthetic.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.470
The way a certain
character has a theme song,

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:40.269
for instance-- this
one character who's

00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:42.310
been lurking in the
background, and you've always

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.645
heard the theme kind
of in the background.

00:24:43.645 --> 00:24:44.769
Then they show up in front.

00:24:44.769 --> 00:24:49.780
And then suddenly it has a full
orchestration of their song.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:53.360
Things like that are how style
and fiction work together,

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.190
this particular character's
theme, whether it's

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:01.560
Gollum, or the theme of one
of the big cities in Lord

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.370
of the Rings, or
something like that.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:09.370
And of course, the level
design of your game itself

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:15.750
both have gameplay
implications and sort

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:18.450
of fictional implications.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:21.700
A post-apocalyptic racing game
looks very, very different

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.890
from, say, a Formula One
modern-day racing game,

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:28.100
or a horse racing game.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.725
And that's going
to not only change

00:25:29.725 --> 00:25:30.850
the way how the game looks.

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.350
It's also going to change
the way how the game plays.

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.940
Is there debris on the track?

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:38.050
Is everything very dusty?

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:40.940
Is everything highly
polished and very clinical,

00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:43.590
for instance?

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.440
And of course what
your characters can

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.790
do in an environment-- if you
say someone's a ninja, then

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.720
I expect this character
has ninja-like abilities.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:58.020
Is this, oh, you're a ninja,
and you kind of punch people

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:01.630
in the face in sort of
one on one fisticuffs?

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:03.374
And it's like,
that's not a ninja.

00:26:03.374 --> 00:26:05.040
You're thinking of
something else there.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:08.280
Maybe you shouldn't call
that person a ninja.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.647
So we've looked a
little bit at Sissy's.

00:26:10.647 --> 00:26:12.230
I want to show a
couple of other games

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:16.400
that I feel do really, really
nail a cohesive aesthetic

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.090
on a very low budget.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.142
And just for the
sake of time, I think

00:26:21.142 --> 00:26:23.350
I'm just going to bring them
up without asking people

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.710
to come down and play.

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:29.190
But how many people have
played Thomas Was Alone?

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:31.012
Just about five people, OK.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.500
Oh, there we go-- OK, it
was just loading up, cool.

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.685
So this is a game that's
mostly about rectangles.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.320
There we go.

00:26:54.781 --> 00:26:57.763
NARRATOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:28.027 --> 00:27:29.610
I'm glad I'm not
making you play this.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.180
Because this is really
giving me a crick in my neck.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.168
NARRATOR: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:42.060
PHILIP TAN: OK, I'd like to
show you a little bit more.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.286
But I find the
contrast on that screen

00:27:44.286 --> 00:27:45.910
is a little bit too
low to actually see

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:47.530
what the level is like.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.330
But it's pretty much
all geometric objects.

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:50.663
They're not all at right angles.

00:27:50.663 --> 00:27:53.440
Not everything in the
game is a rectangle.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:58.170
And you saw some of the water
kind of had some texture to it.

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.870
But it's pretty much all
flat shaded polygons.

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:05.750
The majority of the game is
all flat shaded polygons.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:12.250
What in that very brief
clip that you saw sort of

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.650
gives you a sense of what
the developer of the game

00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:18.619
wanted you to feel
about the game?

00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:19.910
What were some of the elements?

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.118
What were some things that
were working in that game?

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:31.750
STUDENT: There's a
lot of empty space.

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:36.152
And it sort of adds to the
environment of being alone.

00:28:36.152 --> 00:28:37.860
PHILIP TAN: Yeah,
you're very, very small

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:41.498
in the screen compared to
the rest of the screen.

00:28:41.498 --> 00:28:45.490
STUDENT: The music also
gives that same impression.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:48.983
But it's not too depressing.

00:28:48.983 --> 00:28:51.977
Because you've got this
sort of story quality,

00:28:51.977 --> 00:28:55.470
like [INAUDIBLE] 0.8.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.574
So presumably you're
going to get to the part

00:28:57.574 --> 00:28:58.990
where he's not
alone, or whatever.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:29:01.665
PHILIP TAN: Mhm, yeah,
it's Thomas Was Alone, not

00:29:01.665 --> 00:29:02.550
Thomas Is Alone.

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.270
STUDENT: Also, I
haven't played it.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.572
PHILIP TAN: No, you are making
some very logical assumptions

00:29:07.572 --> 00:29:09.030
about this game,
which are actually

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.440
entirely true about this game.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:15.500
Eventually, you find other
cubes, rectangles actually.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.220
All right, and so that's
the way how the music works

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.670
to sort of set
the tone of, yeah,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:25.220
it's kind of melancholy, but
not completely depressing.

00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.196
You've got a bit of a beat.

00:29:28.196 --> 00:29:28.695
What else?

00:29:33.345 --> 00:29:35.470
I can't remember if you
mentioned the voice acting.

00:29:35.470 --> 00:29:38.720
But what's that
doing to the game?

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.100
First of all, who's speaking?

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:49.910
Is it the cube?

00:29:52.766 --> 00:29:54.200
STUDENT: Some external narrator.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:58.210
PHILIP TAN: Some
external narrator, yeah.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:29:59.470
So that's this.

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:00.830
And what does that imply?

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:05.960
What does that tell you
about what this game is

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.220
trying to get you to feel?

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:14.658
What comes to mind?

00:30:14.658 --> 00:30:15.632
Hmm?

00:30:15.632 --> 00:30:16.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:17.183
PHILIP TAN: Say what?

00:30:17.183 --> 00:30:18.110
STUDENT: It's a story.

00:30:18.110 --> 00:30:19.401
PHILIP TAN: That it is a story.

00:30:19.401 --> 00:30:22.408
This is actually more of
a narrative based game.

00:30:22.408 --> 00:30:24.798
STUDENT: It makes you
fell sort of isolated,

00:30:24.798 --> 00:30:27.666
like you're being spoken
to by something far away,

00:30:27.666 --> 00:30:30.534
almost nonexistent, and
you're sort of by yourself.

00:30:30.534 --> 00:30:32.522
PHILIP TAN: Mhm,
so I think there's

00:30:32.522 --> 00:30:34.980
a little bit of the game that
you're kind of being observed

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.230
by this third party that's not
actually part of the story,

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:42.100
but is narrating the
story of this rectangle.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.640
So you're alone, but
not exactly, right?

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.860
There is this third
party there, which

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:50.990
is there to tell your story.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:54.260
And somehow, this story
is going to go places,

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:57.360
as suggested by the music,
but also as suggested by some

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.970
of the things that he says.

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:02.750
He makes mental
notes for the future,

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:05.580
even though the mental notes
are kind of a silly one.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:08.440
That implies there
is a future, right?

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.233
Yep?

00:31:09.233 --> 00:31:11.598
STUDENT: It makes you feel
empathy for the character,

00:31:11.598 --> 00:31:13.490
even though he's
just a rectangle.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:15.390
PHILIP TAN: Mhm, yeah.

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:19.560
Actually, let's talk
about that rectangle.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:22.578
What does the rectangle
do when it jumps?

00:31:22.578 --> 00:31:24.570
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:27.060
PHILIP TAN: Hm?

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:29.852
STUDENT: It gets thinner.

00:31:29.852 --> 00:31:32.060
PHILIP TAN: Yeah, it gets
a little squash and stretch

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.620
animation there.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:37.110
For something that's really
just four right angles,

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.640
it's actually
remarkably expressive

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:40.740
when it actually
does a single job.

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.560
It gives you the sense
that this thing is not

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.470
an inanimate geometric object.

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:48.040
This thing is alive.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.990
This is an organic
square, or rectangle.

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.880
OK, so we've gone
through a couple of ways

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.870
how this game achieves its
sort of aesthetic quality.

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.650
Let me see what my next
slide was going to be.

00:32:08.906 --> 00:32:14.878
All right-- oops, darn it.

00:32:14.878 --> 00:32:16.360
There we go.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.470
I'm hitting the space bar.

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.855
Whenever you see a
big circle radiate,

00:32:40.855 --> 00:32:42.628
that's me hitting the space bar.

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.430
What does that even say?

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:38.350
Oh jeez, OK.

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.850
OK.

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:43.270
OK, so I'm going
to quit that game.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:47.639
So let's talk a
little bit about that.

00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:50.369
First impressions?

00:34:50.369 --> 00:34:53.309
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] panel.

00:34:53.309 --> 00:34:55.269
You have the whole
fish-eye thing

00:34:55.269 --> 00:34:58.390
through the tube thing,
kind of like weird pixels.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:01.035
And you also have this
guy going down the screen.

00:35:01.035 --> 00:35:03.910
PHILIP TAN: Mhm, so there's sort
of a vertical hold jittering

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:04.680
going on.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:07.259
And actually, it
kind of doesn't look

00:35:07.259 --> 00:35:08.550
like it's a flat screen, right?

00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:09.299
It looks kind of--

00:35:09.299 --> 00:35:11.822
STUDENT: Yeah, I kind of said
the old school kind of screen

00:35:11.822 --> 00:35:13.155
with the fish-eye kind of thing.

00:35:13.155 --> 00:35:15.465
PHILIP TAN: Yeah, a
little tube shape to it.

00:35:15.465 --> 00:35:17.110
Yep, that's a good one.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:17.610
What else?

00:35:22.050 --> 00:35:26.204
That's developed by
one guy, by the way.

00:35:26.204 --> 00:35:28.674
STUDENT: You hear him
breathing the whole time.

00:35:28.674 --> 00:35:31.144
So it kind of makes you
feel claustrophobic,

00:35:31.144 --> 00:35:36.084
like you're in a small space
looking at this monitor.

00:35:36.084 --> 00:35:38.940
PHILIP TAN: Mhm,
yep, so the fact

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.980
that you can hear your
own breath sort of

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.229
gives you an impression of
the space around you, which

00:35:43.229 --> 00:35:45.750
is simultaneously
really, really small

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:47.685
and really, really
large at the same time.

00:35:47.685 --> 00:35:49.060
You're in this
tiny little thing,

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.965
but there's this huge
world outside of there.

00:35:52.965 --> 00:35:53.465
What else?

00:35:58.219 --> 00:35:59.010
Is there any music?

00:36:04.926 --> 00:36:07.884
STUDENT: I didn't get
what the objective was.

00:36:07.884 --> 00:36:11.335
But it kind of
sounded [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:11.335 --> 00:36:13.642
kind of space ship or something.

00:36:13.642 --> 00:36:16.100
You're an astronaut in some
kind of spaceship or something,

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.223
and you're trying
to search for air.

00:36:19.223 --> 00:36:20.220
PHILIP TAN: Yep.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:24.200
So let's say, OK,
air is important.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:26.860
And there's a lot of things
that remind you of that, right?

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.660
You have the breathing sounds.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:31.320
You have the things
in the world that

00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.100
are sort of [INAUDIBLE]
that you can pick up.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.440
There's a little oxygen meter.

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.599
I'm not so sure if
all of you saw that.

00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:41.140
There's a little oxygen meter
that's constantly running down.

00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:45.304
And the sound of your
breathing changes

00:36:45.304 --> 00:36:46.970
depending on how much
oxygen you've got,

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.303
or if you pick up an air pocket.

00:36:48.303 --> 00:36:50.620
Then you can breathe.

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.440
What else?

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.200
OK, so you said space ship.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:55.010
And a few people
said space ship.

00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:57.430
What else gives
you the impression

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.740
this might be a space ship?

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.780
Because the game never tells
you that you're in a space ship.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.205
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:05.205 --> 00:37:06.020
PHILIP TAN: Hm?

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:07.990
STUDENT: I actually
thought it was underwater

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.990
instead of a space ship.

00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:10.448
PHILIP TAN: It
could be underwater.

00:37:10.448 --> 00:37:13.440
So what's the evidence for each?

00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:13.940
Yeah?

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.860
STUDENT: So for underwater,
whenever you press space bar,

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:21.290
it kind of looked like
a radar sort of pulse.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:25.450
PHILIP TAN: Mhm, It's
kind of like a sonar ping,

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:28.860
which is something you'd
expect to do underwater.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.300
What are things that remind
you of space in this game?

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:39.172
I would argue that-- oh, yeah.

00:37:39.172 --> 00:37:40.976
STUDENT: Some of the
objects on the screen

00:37:40.976 --> 00:37:44.100
look like they could
be stars [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.560
PHILIP TAN: Mhm, they look
like constellations, right?

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.925
STUDENT: There's that issue when
you're trying to turn around

00:37:49.925 --> 00:37:50.925
you had to kind of stop.

00:37:50.925 --> 00:37:54.320
And it almost seemed
like [INAUDIBLE] thruster

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.260
or some kind of [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:56.260 --> 00:38:00.640
PHILIP TAN: Mhm, yeah, there's
a lot of inertia in changing

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:03.295
your direction, yeah.

00:38:03.295 --> 00:38:05.170
Apparently there is an
answer on whether it's

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.540
space or underwater.

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.040
I don't actually know
the answer to that one.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.770
But they're both
plausible conclusions

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:18.020
from actually nothing that
the game explicitly tells you.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:21.680
All of that you derive from
hints, from the aesthetic.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.545
But because the game kind
of works together really,

00:38:24.545 --> 00:38:27.060
really well on the game
mechanics of running out

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:30.590
of air and the visual
representation of having

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:35.870
this old school monitor, as well
as the sound of you breathing

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:42.970
and everything that you kind of
know about what it's like to be

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.730
in a situation where air
is important, which implies

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.480
certainly not walking around
on the ground somewhere.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:54.250
Or if you are, you might be on a
different planet, or something.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:58.220
And what you know
about inertia gives you

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.430
this impression, this very,
very deep kind of world

00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:03.917
that you can sort of make
theories about and imagine

00:39:03.917 --> 00:39:05.750
where you might be
without the game actually

00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:07.890
having to tell you any of that.

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:11.970
So that's a game where I feel
it's really, really successful

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:14.670
in getting that across.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:17.670
This next one I'm just
going to play a demo.

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:19.770
This is Defcon.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:23.760
It's kind of like a
real-time strategy game,

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.820
only on a sort of
global thermonuclear war

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.250
kind of scale.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.750
Oops.

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:38.030
Screen-- here we go.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:49.270
Is this 1,280 by 800?

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:51.295
I think my screen
resolution changed on me.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:58.960
Yeah, when I tried to
fix that problem earlier,

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:01.980
the screen resolution
changed on me.

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.420
That doesn't matter.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:08.520
I'll switch it to
something else.

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:15.780
Mostly, this is fine.

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.610
So I'm just going
to play a demo.

00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:21.500
This is just a
game that you see.

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:24.140
This is as if the
game is just playing

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:25.740
against itself-- AI versus AI.

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:29.210
If anyone has seen-- how many
of you have seen War Games?

00:40:29.210 --> 00:40:31.380
OK, wow, OK.

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.430
It's Matthew Broderick,
is that right?

00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:37.370
And this is very much
inspired by that.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:40.890
And the idea, of
course-- actually, I'm

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:46.830
not going to tell you
beyond what I just said.

00:40:46.830 --> 00:40:48.620
I want you to start
calling out things

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.700
that you sort of think work
aesthetically about this game.

00:40:52.700 --> 00:40:54.302
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:40:54.302 --> 00:40:56.010
I'm going to move the
camera around, too.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:08.120
This is an actual
game that you're

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.870
watching right now being
played with the AI playing

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:11.515
against itself.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:24.202
Just call out stuff that
strikes you about this game.

00:41:24.202 --> 00:41:30.611
STUDENT: The type face is
very nicely apocalyptic,

00:41:30.611 --> 00:41:36.821
like all angles and-- I don't
really know how to explain it,

00:41:36.821 --> 00:41:38.010
but it feels good.

00:41:38.010 --> 00:41:41.430
PHILIP TAN: It's
stark, if nothing else.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:46.620
There's a certain amount
of brutishness about it,

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:48.790
but also very technological.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:53.610
It's not just like
hewn out of rock.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:57.025
It's not that kind
of brutishness.

00:41:57.025 --> 00:41:59.441
STUDENT: It's technological,
but it looks very old school.

00:41:59.441 --> 00:42:01.790
It's very much like
a radar screen.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:06.620
PHILIP TAN: Yeah,
not necessarily even

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.620
year 2000, right?

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:14.550
This seems like a much
older aesthetic, something

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.340
from the '80s maybe, Cold War.

00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:26.160
Scroll over to something
a little bit closer.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.210
No one's in America.

00:42:30.423 --> 00:42:31.422
This is continental war.

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.920
What else?

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.710
What song is this?

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:43.520
Does anyone recognize the music?

00:42:47.413 --> 00:42:49.908
STUDENT: Does anybody hear
anything other than music?

00:42:54.898 --> 00:42:57.892
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:57.892 --> 00:42:58.890
PHILIP TAN: Thunder?

00:42:58.890 --> 00:42:59.888
STUDENT: Is it thunder?

00:42:59.888 --> 00:43:03.410
STUDENT: It's this explosion.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.430
PHILIP TAN: Where do you think--

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.450
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:12.280
PHILIP TAN: It's a little
[INAUDIBLE], really soft.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.570
Where are you?

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:16.992
Where are you supposed to be
while you're playing this game?

00:43:16.992 --> 00:43:18.170
STUDENT: War room.

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:20.650
PHILIP TAN: In a war
room underground,

00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:22.306
several miles
underground, maybe.

00:43:26.982 --> 00:43:27.940
It's a disturbing game.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:38.650
The music-- I believe
it's all classical music.

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:43.870
But it's heavily filtered
through a lot of audio filters,

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:48.840
giving it a sort of a reverb
effect in the sort of sense

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:53.190
that you might be hearing this
inside a small enclosed space.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.650
There's a little cassette player
inside your bunker somewhere.

00:44:01.810 --> 00:44:04.060
So besides the font,
what about the UI?

00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.020
What about the UI seems
to be-- in the way

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.270
how the units are represented?

00:44:16.426 --> 00:44:18.300
Like those ships-- are
those ships life-size?

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:22.538
They're not, right?

00:44:22.538 --> 00:44:25.440
They're not the size of
several cities put together.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.830
These are some abstract
representations.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:33.490
These are sort of army pieces
that you're moving on a board,

00:44:33.490 --> 00:44:37.840
only it's a digital board,
that represent armies that

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:39.430
are out there in
the water or flying

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:44.130
through the air, squadrons
that are flying through the air

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:45.670
somehow.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:51.030
So I'm going to quit now.

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:55.530
So Defcon is, again,
a very small team,

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:57.260
I think less than five people.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.950
At least they were
less than five people

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:59.866
when they made Defcon.

00:44:59.866 --> 00:45:01.930
Now they're making other games.

00:45:01.930 --> 00:45:03.866
It was one of the
first successful games

00:45:03.866 --> 00:45:06.240
by Introversion, which is the
name of the indie developer

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.420
that did this.

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:11.840
And yeah, they explicitly stated
that this is very much inspired

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.640
by War Games the movie.

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.000
It's about global
thermonuclear war.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.670
It's about
specifically the movie

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:21.830
that was done in the '80s.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.740
So it's very much about what
global thermonuclear war would

00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:28.619
have made sense in the '80s.

00:45:28.619 --> 00:45:30.160
Obviously, the
graphic representation

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.990
of what you see in that game
is a little bit higher end

00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:35.330
than what you would normally
have had in the '80s.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.621
But they're trying to sort
of not necessarily represent

00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:40.470
things realistically, but sort
of how things as Hollywood

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.260
might have seen it.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:46.180
And even the
marketing of the game

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:50.565
says-- I believe it's,
"Everybody dies," or something

00:45:50.565 --> 00:45:52.200
like that.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.820
And you can't really
win that game, right?

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:00.585
This is what the packaging
of this game looks like.

00:46:00.585 --> 00:46:01.960
I think if you go
to [INAUDIBLE],

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:04.370
this is what it looks like now.

00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:06.065
Uplink is another game by them.

00:46:06.065 --> 00:46:07.990
It's worth checking out.

00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:09.680
It's a game about hacking.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.130
And if you look at that,
you'll see all the same sort

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:13.324
of '80s influences.

00:46:13.324 --> 00:46:15.490
But it's not about launching
missiles at each other.

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.073
It's about breaking
into bank accounts

00:46:17.073 --> 00:46:20.365
and changing your school
grades and things like that.

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:24.690
Finally, this is
a game I actually

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:25.890
do want people to play.

00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:27.900
So who hasn't played Aaaaa!?

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.670
All right, I want a volunteer
to come down and play this game.

00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:36.026
Come on down.

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:37.998
NARRATOR: Dejobaan
Games and Owlchemy Labs,

00:46:37.998 --> 00:46:42.930
two lovers entwined
in an awkward embrace.

00:46:42.930 --> 00:46:45.544
PHILIP TAN: This is
from Boston, by the way.

00:46:45.544 --> 00:46:48.532
[ROBOTIC VOICE]

00:46:54.508 --> 00:46:55.504
STUDENT: Jump?

00:46:55.504 --> 00:46:56.430
PHILIP TAN: Go for it.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:07.720
What can you--

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.732
STUDENT: Stage-- I
don't know, [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.870
PHILIP TAN: Hit Unlock.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:21.650
Oh.

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:24.920
STUDENT: Oh, bye.

00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.585
PHILIP TAN: Just try-- OK.

00:47:29.810 --> 00:47:30.310
That one?

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.282
Try it.

00:47:31.282 --> 00:47:35.656
Yeah, OK, then hit Play.

00:47:35.656 --> 00:47:38.160
OK, so the basic
idea of this game

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.730
is it's a base
jumping simulator.

00:47:39.730 --> 00:47:42.780
So use WASD to jump off
the side of a building,

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:43.886
and then just fall.

00:47:43.886 --> 00:47:44.760
NARRATOR: Checkpoint.

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:46.260
PHILIP TAN: Try not
to hit anything.

00:47:49.365 --> 00:47:49.948
STUDENT: Shit.

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:59.670
PHILIP TAN: But try to get as
close to things as possible,

00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:01.470
because that's how
you get points.

00:48:05.398 --> 00:48:06.871
Oh, something [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:13.736 --> 00:48:14.236
Ouch.

00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.490
Is this in Endless mode?

00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:20.710
STUDENT: Ah, I don't know.

00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:24.258
PHILIP TAN: This
seems like it is.

00:48:24.258 --> 00:48:25.878
STUDENT: No.

00:48:25.878 --> 00:48:26.753
NARRATOR: Checkpoint.

00:48:31.244 --> 00:48:33.710
STUDENT: Sorry, controls
are really light.

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:35.800
PHILIP TAN: OK, try
hitting space bar.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.046
Oh, no, no, no, not yet.

00:48:38.046 --> 00:48:39.045
STUDENT: Oh wait, oh no.

00:48:39.045 --> 00:48:39.310
PHILIP TAN: It's cool.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:40.325
It's fine.

00:48:40.325 --> 00:48:44.390
All right, now try to land
in that little circle,

00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:48.034
little red circle
behind that building.

00:48:48.034 --> 00:48:48.534
Yep.

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:57.863
STUDENT: Come on.

00:48:57.863 --> 00:48:59.850
PHILIP TAN: Yeah,
try landing there.

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.370
You did it.

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:05.212
OK, thank you.

00:49:05.212 --> 00:49:08.056
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:15.537
PHILIP TAN: OK, I'm going
to turn the volume down.

00:49:15.537 --> 00:49:17.245
What's working for
this game's aesthetic?

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:23.385
Did I see a hand back there?

00:49:23.385 --> 00:49:24.870
Yeah, right there.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:26.602
STUDENT: We're all
really used to games

00:49:26.602 --> 00:49:29.562
with cylindrical coordinates
through a camera.

00:49:29.562 --> 00:49:31.740
And this game appeared
to have it be the case

00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:34.297
that as you look down, one
can then rotate your camera.

00:49:34.297 --> 00:49:36.338
It really felt like you're
looking straight down.

00:49:36.338 --> 00:49:38.758
And so we're very used to
having cylindrical coordinates.

00:49:38.758 --> 00:49:39.995
PHILIP TAN: Mhm, yeah.

00:49:39.995 --> 00:49:44.810
This is a game that uses sort
of WASD first person controls.

00:49:44.810 --> 00:49:48.462
Only first of all,
you're not carrying a gun

00:49:48.462 --> 00:49:49.670
and looking around like that.

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:52.130
You're pretty much doing
this for the entire game.

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:58.080
So you're always kind of
rotating around your center.

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.554
So that's a
systemic-- essentially

00:50:01.554 --> 00:50:02.470
how the controls work.

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:04.595
STUDENT: Checkpoint restart
happened really, really

00:50:04.595 --> 00:50:06.680
fast when you screwed up.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.710
PHILIP TAN: Yeah, yeah, so it's
like, survive to this point,

00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:12.140
get to the next checkpoint.

00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:14.250
And things are actually
flying past you

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.670
at a pretty high rate as well.

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:17.610
What else?

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:22.860
Music?

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:24.331
Art?

00:50:24.331 --> 00:50:24.830
Storyline?

00:50:28.847 --> 00:50:29.680
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:35.985 --> 00:50:37.655
PHILIP TAN: I think
the music-- does

00:50:37.655 --> 00:50:41.540
it start the moment your foot
leaves the first building?

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:43.690
I think there are
some levels where

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:46.147
it does that, where the
music only starts the moment

00:50:46.147 --> 00:50:47.230
you jump off the building.

00:50:47.230 --> 00:50:48.570
It's like, you can stay
on top of the building

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:49.403
as long as you want.

00:50:49.403 --> 00:50:50.270
But nothing happens.

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:52.810
And then as soon as you
jump off, the music starts.

00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:55.990
So it's like, all right, now
you're doing something that you

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:58.317
should feel excited about.

00:50:58.317 --> 00:51:00.400
So we're going to play
this exciting music at you.

00:51:02.816 --> 00:51:04.940
STUDENT: You can hear the
air while you're falling.

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.090
PHILIP TAN: Yeah, there's a very
strong sort of rushing sound.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:10.710
And you're getting
other UI sounds as well.

00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:13.840
Those are the things that
are actually giving you

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:15.580
points, getting close
to other buildings.

00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.680
And so there's some
visual feedback.

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.474
STUDENT: The game menu before
it starts is really confusing.

00:51:20.474 --> 00:51:21.640
There was just way too much.

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:23.630
I don't think that
was working at all.

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:27.110
PHILIP TAN: Yeah, the thing is
I've played a bit of this game.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:31.760
So it normally directs
you to the first thing

00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.210
that you can click
really clearly.

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:35.050
And then at some
point of time, it

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:39.119
stops leading you
to a linear path.

00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:41.160
So you've got this whole
grid of different things

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.560
that you can do to choose one.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:46.920
So admittedly, the
game UI may not

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.390
achieve what it's trying to do.

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.230
But what do you think
it's trying to do,

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:54.260
even if it fails at it?

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:56.700
It's sort of like, here's
this ridiculous grid

00:51:56.700 --> 00:52:00.160
of all of these different
things that you can do.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.380
But maybe some of them are
unlocked, or some of them

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:06.330
are still locked and some
things are still locked out.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.470
What's the point of showing
you all these things

00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:11.180
that you can't do?

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.180
STUDENT: Try and motivate
you to unlock them

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:14.180
so that you can do them.

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.070
PHILIP TAN: Right,
this whole idea

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:20.370
is that-- it's the
same idea in Zelda.

00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.490
Sometimes you see this
heart in a location

00:52:22.490 --> 00:52:24.730
which you know that you
can't actually get to yet.

00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:28.480
But the whole point of that is
to make you want to get there.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.560
And that's what the unlock
system in this game, I believe,

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.310
is trying to do.

00:52:33.310 --> 00:52:36.462
It wants to give you an
incentive to keep playing.

00:52:36.462 --> 00:52:38.045
Because there's all
this other content

00:52:38.045 --> 00:52:39.350
that you haven't seen yet.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.129
But you kind of have a
clue that it's out there.

00:52:42.129 --> 00:52:43.670
At the beginning of
the game, there's

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:46.044
a little narration actually
that you may not have caught.

00:52:46.044 --> 00:52:50.110
It says, the city of Boston
has outlawed base jumping,

00:52:50.110 --> 00:52:51.950
so this whole idea
that what you're doing

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:54.280
isn't actually sanctioned
by the authorities.

00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:56.810
And eventually, you get
these commands later

00:52:56.810 --> 00:53:01.332
where you can flip off
people while you jump off,

00:53:01.332 --> 00:53:02.790
unless they happen
to be your fans.

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:04.248
And then you give
them a thumbs up.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:14.140
So there's a sense that what
you're doing isn't advisable.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:18.730
This is not supposed to be
just how the future looks like.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:22.170
Even in this weird future where
you have these mega skyscrapers

00:53:22.170 --> 00:53:26.146
that go all the way into space,
this is still not a good idea.

00:53:26.146 --> 00:53:27.520
But you're going
to do it anyway.

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:30.220
That's what this game is about.

00:53:30.220 --> 00:53:33.350
So it's a 3D game.

00:53:33.350 --> 00:53:35.650
This one was done
in Unity, actually,

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:38.390
although it was on port from
a game that wasn't originally

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:39.280
developed in Unity.

00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:41.550
So you think of the
very first version,

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:45.340
which is just called
AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!--

00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:47.390
A Reckless Disregard
for Gravity.

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:48.080
Is that right?

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:48.580
Yeah.

00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:51.010
That game only runs on Windows.

00:53:51.010 --> 00:53:53.410
And all the versions
that have come since then

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:54.990
have all run on
multiple platforms.

00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:56.531
Because they were
developed on Unity.

00:53:56.531 --> 00:53:57.880
STUDENT: Including Oculus Rift.

00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:58.940
PHILIP TAN: Including Oculus
Rift, an Oculus Rift version

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.460
of that game.

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:02.700
You can imagine how
that would work.

00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:08.850
Anyway, so something that
I want to end on today--

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:12.320
there's a second
presentation very quickly.

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.320
Actually, you know what?

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.770
I've been talking for an hour.

00:54:14.770 --> 00:54:16.548
Let's take a quick break.

00:54:16.548 --> 00:54:22.500
And we'll come back
in 2:15, 10 minutes.

00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.540
All right, let me
see, am I on mute?

00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:28.680
OK, so what I'm
going to do now is

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:32.340
I'm going to have
your groups actually

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:36.390
have a discussion about what you
want your game mechanics to do.

00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:38.280
And the reason for
this is because I

00:54:38.280 --> 00:54:41.730
feel that a lot of you
probably are decently equipped

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:45.470
to talk about what you want your
story lines and your characters

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:49.360
or your art style or your sound
design to achieve in your game.

00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:51.950
And the reason for that is
we've seen a lot of movies.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:54.910
We know how we react to music.

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:58.520
We realize what visuals have
on sort of human emotion.

00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.880
But I'm not sure if you've
had this discussion yet

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.940
in your team about what you
want your mechanics to do

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:04.740
aesthetically.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.090
What kind of
experience do you want

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:09.100
to generate for the player?

00:55:09.100 --> 00:55:12.231
So really, it's what you want
everything in your game to do.

00:55:12.231 --> 00:55:14.230
But right now, I'm asking
you to do a discussion

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:17.820
about what you specifically
want your games to do.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.372
I'm going to throw
some words at you

00:55:19.372 --> 00:55:23.320
to help you be able to frame
these ideas inside your team.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:24.842
First is that, is this a game?

00:55:24.842 --> 00:55:27.050
How many of you feel like
you're making a game that's

00:55:27.050 --> 00:55:32.760
kind of about strategically
outwitting the game system,

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:34.930
being smarter than the
computer, basically,

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:38.080
or being smarter than
the game designer, that's

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:41.150
how you win the game?

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:43.380
How many of you feel
like your game is really

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:46.840
about some random thing
happens, and now you

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.080
have to deal with it?

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.210
OK I see a couple, a few,
hands out there, maybe.

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:54.970
And some of you don't
know where your game

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:57.810
falls in that spectrum.

00:55:57.810 --> 00:56:02.835
Of course, it could be
a bit of both, right?

00:56:02.835 --> 00:56:06.170
A French writer named
Roger Caillois came up

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:09.822
with a categorization of what
these different kinds of game

00:56:09.822 --> 00:56:11.920
play could be termed.

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.570
And he came up
with Agon and Alea.

00:56:14.570 --> 00:56:18.150
Alea, some of you, if you've
ever studied Latin or Roman

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:19.870
history or anything,
might recognize it

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:24.210
from alea lacta est,
which is, the die is cast.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:25.990
So that word comes from dice.

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:28.460
And it sort of represents
games of chance.

00:56:28.460 --> 00:56:30.760
And Agon is a little
bit more about conflict.

00:56:30.760 --> 00:56:34.400
It's about usually person
versus person conflict.

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.900
But in case of
games, it's just kind

00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:41.040
of like competitive
contests of skill.

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.826
Basically how well can you
deal with this challenge

00:56:44.826 --> 00:56:45.950
that's put in front of you?

00:56:48.247 --> 00:56:50.830
Caillois goes on and describes
this as, this is sort of ludus.

00:56:50.830 --> 00:56:53.000
This is the ludic
kind of play where

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.370
you're sort of playing--
it's very specific to what

00:56:56.370 --> 00:56:58.170
games are all about.

00:56:58.170 --> 00:57:00.350
There are other forms
of play out there

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:03.040
in the world that
don't necessarily

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.180
have anything to do with games.

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.880
A game isn't required to
have one of these things.

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.130
But for the most
part, what Caillois

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:13.540
claims is that these
kinds of actions

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:15.700
are the things that
really, really sort of

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:22.580
set games apart from other kinds
of play, this Agon and Alea.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:24.940
But then there's-- what
else is there in play?

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.320
There's paidia and
ilinx, which are, again,

00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.730
words that I don't necessarily
expect you to remember.

00:57:29.730 --> 00:57:32.540
But here are words that
might be a little bit easier

00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:38.230
to recollect, the sense of
being someone that you are not,

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:43.050
mimicking something that you
might fantasize in being,

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:45.170
or that you're being
asked to perform.

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:48.350
Are you a person on
the run from zombies?

00:57:48.350 --> 00:57:50.080
Are you a military soldier?

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.740
Are you a detective?

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:58.650
Are you an assassin, a
scoundrel, that sort of thing?

00:57:58.650 --> 00:58:00.380
You're being asked
to play that part.

00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:03.550
Are you a town hall mayor?

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:07.370
Whereas vertigo, it's about
the sort of physical sensation

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:09.140
of playing the game.

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.900
And when it comes
to digital games,

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.390
usually that's one of the
things that digital games

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:14.620
have the biggest problem.

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:17.440
Unless you're doing something
like Dance Dance Revolution,

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:20.260
where you're actually having
to play the game as a full body

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:21.540
or a Kinect thing.

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:24.590
But even games like
Aaaaa!, we were

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:27.530
describing a game that's
very much trying to give you

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:30.390
this sense of physical motion.

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:32.670
So they're trying to
sort of conjure up

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:38.850
this sort of bodily freedom,
even if that freedom

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:41.640
necessarily means
a loss of control,

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:45.260
to sort of give you a
pleasurable experience.

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:47.227
And you get that in
other kinds of play.

00:58:47.227 --> 00:58:48.810
How many of you
played that game where

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:51.740
you go around a baseball
bat with your head down,

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:54.410
and then you have to walk?

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:56.480
No one does this?

00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.562
That's my favorite game.

00:58:58.562 --> 00:59:00.310
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:00.310 --> 00:59:02.635
PHILIP TAN: Yeah, you get
yourself as dizzy as you can.

00:59:02.635 --> 00:59:04.219
Sometimes you look
up and you spin.

00:59:04.219 --> 00:59:05.760
Sometimes you look
down and you spin.

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.250
And then you try
to make your way

00:59:07.250 --> 00:59:09.580
across to the other
side of the finish line.

00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:14.000
And that's like
literal vertigo, right?

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.110
So we've got these different
kinds of sensations

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:24.300
that this one series has already
described, and probably not

00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.830
everything that games
can possibly do.

00:59:27.830 --> 00:59:31.660
But they're kind of, in one way
of describing it, kinds of fun.

00:59:31.660 --> 00:59:36.040
There is the sort of
competitive test of skill.

00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:42.920
There is the, does
fortune favor you today?

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:45.510
Are you feeling lucky right now?

00:59:45.510 --> 00:59:46.865
Do you want to press your luck?

00:59:46.865 --> 00:59:51.580
Do you get to be
somebody else and live

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.630
through that experience?

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:55.680
Or do you just get to be in
a sort of physical situation

00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.259
that you haven't been?

00:59:57.259 --> 00:59:59.550
These are all different things
that your game mechanics

00:59:59.550 --> 01:00:01.940
can achieve.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:05.110
What I'd like to describe is
like the stuff on the right

01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:08.580
is the stuff that sort of
puts you into the moment.

01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:14.480
This is where you're being
asked to spontaneously react.

01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:19.520
Can you think like a mayor of a
city, or president, or monarch?

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:24.210
Can you react in a
way as if buildings

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:29.060
were flying towards you
at 200 miles per hour?

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.950
Whereas everything on the right
is what we typically described

01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:35.420
as the structure of the games.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:38.050
You've been experimenting
with this in your prototypes

01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:41.120
since day one.

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:44.480
But there's also kind
of the differences

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.520
between the decisions
that you get to make

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.810
and the things that kind
of just happen to you,

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:51.390
and you get to react.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:55.510
So I like to describe the stuff
at the bottom as kind of fate.

01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:58.880
This is the fate that you have.

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:02.230
Buildings are going
to fly into your face.

01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:05.940
And you kind of need
to be able to then make

01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.180
decisions to be able to
just deal with that reality.

01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:14.700
Or fate being, well, the dice
is going to show what it is.

01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:16.462
But the test of
skill is the part

01:01:16.462 --> 01:01:17.920
where you get to
decide what you're

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.445
going to do given
that you know the odds

01:01:20.445 --> 01:01:26.730
and that you know what kind
of actions that you can take.

01:01:26.730 --> 01:01:29.690
So right now, in
your teams, what

01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:35.050
I'd like you to do is actually
have a discussion about given

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:38.405
your prototypes that
you've developed so far--

01:01:38.405 --> 01:01:40.030
I don't think we're
doing a test today.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.630
We're doing tests
on Monday, right?

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:44.770
So what do you want
your prototype on Monday

01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:46.880
to try to achieve?

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.500
It could be any
combination of this.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.150
It could be all of it.

01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:52.850
But I would like you to have
that discussion in your team,

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:56.520
just maybe 15 minutes?

01:01:56.520 --> 01:01:59.160
Yeah, that's plenty of time.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.170
And then what we're
going to do is just

01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:04.820
do a very quick report
back about where you think

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:08.790
your team-- just one person
from each team will come down

01:02:08.790 --> 01:02:10.900
and tell us, what are
the things that you think

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.420
you want your game
mechanics to achieve

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:17.970
in your prototype on Monday, OK?

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:19.070
15 minutes.

01:02:19.070 --> 01:02:25.200
That will get us to
basically about 2:40.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.790
All right, so go right ahead.

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:30.440
I'll just leave that up.

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.870
[BACKGROUND CHATTER]

01:02:53.752 --> 01:02:55.460
STUDENT: So our game,
as it is right now,

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.670
you're basically playing
like a child or an animal.

01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:59.350
We haven't decided.

01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:01.470
And you're basically
going to go around

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:04.520
town figuring out this mystery.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.260
So you're kind of playing
like a detective type story.

01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:12.310
So based on the
slide, ours is more

01:03:12.310 --> 01:03:13.782
like structure and decision.

01:03:13.782 --> 01:03:15.490
So it's going to be
sort of a competition

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:18.210
against the computer where
you're trying to figure out

01:03:18.210 --> 01:03:20.684
this mystery of what's
causing cholera,

01:03:20.684 --> 01:03:22.600
or what's causing people
to be sick, actually.

01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:24.720
You won't know
that it's cholera.

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720
So yeah, that's basically
where our game stands.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.053
PHILIP TAN: OK, all right, cool.

01:03:28.053 --> 01:03:29.030
Thank you.

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:32.640
A very analytical
detective game that you're

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.010
working towards-- that's for the
prototype and tests on Monday.

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:40.820
Who's next?

01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:41.849
Come on up.

01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:47.970
STUDENT: Hi, we're Snap.

01:03:47.970 --> 01:03:51.690
So we're planning on making a
very competition heavy game.

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:53.630
Because you're
going to be playing

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.410
with a bunch of other people.

01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:57.990
So for Monday, we want
to have that competition

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:00.699
structure in place so that
we can see how it works.

01:04:00.699 --> 01:04:02.490
We're also adding a
little bit more fiction

01:04:02.490 --> 01:04:04.790
to Snap, which is very abstract.

01:04:04.790 --> 01:04:08.739
And so we're going to later
on test how that works out.

01:04:08.739 --> 01:04:10.197
But for now, it's
just really going

01:04:10.197 --> 01:04:14.199
to be the basic competition of
the game that you've played.

01:04:14.199 --> 01:04:15.740
PHILIP TAN: OK, all
right, thank you.

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.190
STUDENT: So for
Heatwave, we're mainly

01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:32.910
going to focus on
originally decision,

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:34.660
deciding who you're
going to help

01:04:34.660 --> 01:04:37.230
and how long you're going
to try and convince them

01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:39.610
to drink some
water or go inside.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:42.010
And there's also going to
be a small aspect of fate.

01:04:42.010 --> 01:04:45.750
Because you can spend 10 turns
trying to convince a person

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:46.641
to go inside.

01:04:46.641 --> 01:04:48.140
And at the end of
the 10 turns, they

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.110
say, no, I don't want
to talk to you anyone.

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:51.140
I'm not going inside.

01:04:51.140 --> 01:04:53.170
So decision and fate.

01:04:53.170 --> 01:04:55.110
PHILIP TAN: OK, cool, thank you.

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:07.740
STUDENT: Our team is working
on forecast based financing.

01:05:07.740 --> 01:05:10.650
So because we're about
planning for disasters,

01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:12.990
our game is pretty
heavy on chance.

01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:15.130
But what we want to
teach the players to do

01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:17.600
is to use planning
and forecasting

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.860
in order to reduce the effects
of that chance and sort of gain

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:24.212
valuable skills in
mitigating that.

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:26.532
PHILIP TAN: All right.

01:05:26.532 --> 01:05:30.731
So it's very much on the
right side of this screen.

01:05:30.731 --> 01:05:31.230
OK.

01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:38.600
STUDENT: Hi, so we're
the other cholera group.

01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:43.020
And we decided to create
a simulation based

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:44.890
game where there
are many villages,

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.770
and they have their
own water source.

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:51.830
And we have cholera
as some sort of entity

01:05:51.830 --> 01:05:53.820
that can sort of
spread from village

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.810
to water to other villages.

01:05:55.810 --> 01:06:00.660
And pretty much every village
has their own population.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:02.160
They have their
own infection rate.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:07.300
And what you are, you are
pretty much some sort of person

01:06:07.300 --> 01:06:10.080
who really has a lot
of power and wants

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.290
to fix this cholera outbreak.

01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:14.780
So this game focuses a
lot on decision making,

01:06:14.780 --> 01:06:18.295
because you have many
different ways to try

01:06:18.295 --> 01:06:22.440
to fix this problem--
either short term using

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:25.540
simple purification systems to
launch for waste management.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.190
But this game also
has a lot of chance.

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:31.574
Because obviously, these
things aren't 100% efficient.

01:06:31.574 --> 01:06:32.990
There's going to
be some failures,

01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.540
going to be some breakdowns.

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:36.350
What we want to
focus on right now

01:06:36.350 --> 01:06:40.600
is to make sure that we can
get our villages to have

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.700
their own sort of
parameters, make sure

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:47.390
that the cholera-- we have some
way of representing cholera

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:51.710
and how they spread to
all the other villages.

01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:52.956
PHILIP TAN: Cool, thank you.

01:06:52.956 --> 01:06:55.638
Is that all the teams,
or was there one more?

01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:59.880
That's pretty much it.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:05.370
OK, just a quick thing, so a
couple of thoughts-- one thing

01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:08.760
that you should be
trying to figure out

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.450
as you work on your
prototypes is to what extent

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:14.890
the decision making,
which came up

01:07:14.890 --> 01:07:16.380
with a lot of the
different groups,

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:20.280
going to be reacting to things
that you hadn't anticipated,

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.950
versus crafting
a long term plan.

01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:26.760
The stuff that you deal
with on the short term

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:30.480
is going to go very
heavy on this side.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.780
And it's going to
play a very big part

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:35.514
in making someone feel
like the kind of person

01:07:35.514 --> 01:07:37.680
that you want to feel,
whether you're a big decision

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.220
maker or an individual
on the ground.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:43.667
The long term plan part of
it is really more game-y.

01:07:43.667 --> 01:07:46.250
You're really thinking more as
someone who's playing the game,

01:07:46.250 --> 01:07:49.410
rather than someone who's
actually living the game.

01:07:49.410 --> 01:07:52.850
And you can also
decide that's more

01:07:52.850 --> 01:07:55.024
what you want people
to be going for,

01:07:55.024 --> 01:07:56.440
especially games
that have to deal

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.800
a lot with planning for chance.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.870
Now, just because you have
random numbers in your game,

01:08:01.870 --> 01:08:03.560
and probability
rates and everything,

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.630
doesn't necessarily mean that
your game is all about chance,

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:11.130
even though you have these
things in your system.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:14.532
Because if what chance
in your game really means

01:08:14.532 --> 01:08:16.990
is that there is a certain rate
at which certain things are

01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:19.680
going to happen, then
really that's just a rate.

01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:21.529
That's something that
you can plan for.

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:25.109
You can just expect
every 10 turns,

01:08:25.109 --> 01:08:27.010
you're going to get
three outbreaks.

01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:29.149
That's how the numbers
are going to break down,

01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:31.440
even though you don't know
exactly when those rates are

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.830
going to be.

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:37.779
And if your game is where every
single one of those times where

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.059
chance hits is really
catastrophically or really,

01:08:40.059 --> 01:08:42.000
really beneficial,
then you've got

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:43.346
to get more of a game of chance.

01:08:43.346 --> 01:08:45.970
If it's the sort of thing like
a certain number of these things

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:47.600
are going to happen
at a given rate,

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:50.180
and you just have to plan for
that rate, that is, to me, not

01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:51.770
really chance anymore.

01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:56.279
It's more about that
skill based test

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:58.050
of whether you can plan well.

01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:02.290
So again, always
keep in mind, what

01:09:02.290 --> 01:09:05.210
do you want your
game to feel like,

01:09:05.210 --> 01:09:08.559
while you're trying to figure
out whether your simulation is

01:09:08.559 --> 01:09:11.100
right, whether your facts are
right, whether this is actually

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.879
what happens with the
diseases or the catastrophes

01:09:14.879 --> 01:09:15.920
that you're dealing with.

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.420
Also keep in mind this is
what you want your game

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:19.270
to feel like.

01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:21.899
Make sure that's also informing
how you're designing your game

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:25.370
mechanics and your art
style and your story

01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:27.939
line and your
characters and so forth.

01:09:27.939 --> 01:09:30.670
That's what I've got to say.

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:33.279
PROFESSOR: So administratively
for Monday, we

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:37.078
have a lecture in the morning
about games for learning.

01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:38.494
Then we're going
to do play tests.

01:09:38.494 --> 01:09:40.109
And then at the
end of play test,

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.350
we're going to do the
two minute presentations,

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:44.600
so that when you're play
testing, even though we heard

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.225
a little bit about
what your games are,

01:09:46.225 --> 01:09:48.696
we're not completely-- we'll
still be a little naive when

01:09:48.696 --> 01:09:49.779
you're playing your games.

01:09:49.779 --> 01:09:52.950
We'll know exactly what's
going on within the games.

01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:54.560
In that two minute
presentation, we

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.340
want to know a
lot about process.

01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.920
So let us know how you got to
the point where you are now

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.315
and where you
think you're going.

01:10:00.315 --> 01:10:03.670
I believe product backlogs
are due at that point, too.

01:10:03.670 --> 01:10:07.350
So use your product backlog
as part of your telling us

01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:10.805
what you're planning on
doing on your projects.

01:10:10.805 --> 01:10:12.400
I know a few of
you have come to me

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:15.420
and asked me about certain
aspects of your projects

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:17.587
that might not be answered
by the resource materials

01:10:17.587 --> 01:10:18.461
that we've given you.

01:10:18.461 --> 01:10:20.490
So hopefully you've read
through the resources,

01:10:20.490 --> 01:10:22.760
and you're finding some
of your answers there.

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.840
If there are any
questions you have

01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:27.530
that are not being
answered by your research,

01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:30.610
email that to videogame-bosses,
and we'll forward that along

01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:32.800
to the clients.

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:37.160
I'm working to get them to
allow me to just give you

01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.430
their email address so you
can contact them directly.

01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:41.004
I'm still figuring
out who exactly

01:10:41.004 --> 01:10:42.920
for each of those projects
that's going to be.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.590
But that should be
solidified by Monday.

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:48.740
But yeah, things to look
out for that might not

01:10:48.740 --> 01:10:52.240
be answered in your resources
are cultural sensitivity,

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.630
particularly because of who
your target audience might be.

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:58.740
So if you're doing
anything graphical,

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:00.490
if you're doing anything
representational,

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:03.320
really think hard about who it
is is playing the game, what

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.830
kind of cultural
background they have,

01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:08.200
and how are you
representing it to them.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:13.120
Are you doing it both
authentically and also

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:15.049
not patronizing them?

01:11:15.049 --> 01:11:17.090
It's going to be a really
hard challenge for you.

01:11:17.090 --> 01:11:19.381
We don't expect you to actually
solve it this semester.

01:11:19.381 --> 01:11:21.785
We expect you to come
up with some ways

01:11:21.785 --> 01:11:23.910
to figure out how you might
solve it in the future.

01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:26.118
And that's kind of what we
want to hear about in some

01:11:26.118 --> 01:11:27.240
of these presentations.

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.780
Or how are you solving
those kind of problems?

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:32.770
Any questions before we
let you go and let you

01:11:32.770 --> 01:11:35.185
work in your teams?

01:11:35.185 --> 01:11:37.560
STUDENT: Can you give us an
idea of how much time we'll

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.018
have in class to work with our
teams so we can better plan?

01:11:40.018 --> 01:11:42.120
PROFESSOR: Hour and a half.

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.420
We went a little bit long
today, about 20 minutes long.

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.670
PHILIP TAN: That's all my
fault. I'm sorry about that.

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:49.490
PROFESSOR: Blame him, but
hour and a half basically.

01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:52.807
If there's a guest lecture,
those tend to be an hour long.

01:11:52.807 --> 01:11:54.390
And then that would
be two hours long.

01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:56.260
If it's not a guest
lecture, we tend

01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:59.449
to ramble, so hour and a half.

01:11:59.449 --> 01:12:01.615
Also part of that is because
we start class at 1:10.

01:12:01.615 --> 01:12:02.930
That kills some of the time.

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:04.997
So if you want to come
into class at 1:00

01:12:04.997 --> 01:12:06.830
and be in your teams
and work in your teams,

01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:09.025
and then we yell at you
to shut up, that's fine.

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:09.900
That's actually good.

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:11.067
You're using your time well.

01:12:11.067 --> 01:12:12.650
PHILIP TAN: Yeah,
you come in at 1:00,

01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:14.379
and then do a daily
scrub, and then you

01:12:14.379 --> 01:12:16.629
are ready to start class.

01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:17.920
PROFESSOR: Any other questions?

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.250
All right, so I'm putting
these materials up here.

01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:24.830
And also a reminder,
the play test,

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:26.770
if we weren't really
specific about it,

01:12:26.770 --> 01:12:29.486
we are expecting low
fidelity prototypes.

01:12:29.486 --> 01:12:30.860
But it could be
digital or paper.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:33.280
It's really whatever is
useful for you, that's

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:34.600
what we want to see tested.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.950
